      <field name="fulltext">? neque, me vt miretur turba, laboro: Contentus paucis lectoribus. To Ben. Ionson, on his VVorks. May I subscribe a name? dares my bold quill Write that or good or ill, Whose frame is of that height, that, to mine eye, Its head is in the sky? Yes. Since the most censures, beleeves, and saith By an implicit faith: Lest their misfortune make them chance amisse, I'le wast them right by this. Of all I know thou onely art the man That dares but what he can: Yet by performance showes he can doe more Than hath beene done before, Or will be after (such assurance gives Perfection where it lives.) Words speak thy matter; matter fills thy words; And choyce that grace affords That both are best: and both most fitly plac't, Are with new Venus grac't From artfull method; all in this point meet, With good to mingle sweet. These are thy lower parts. What stands above Who sees not yet must love, When on the Base he reades Ben. Jonsons name, And heares the rest from Fame. This from my love of truth: which payes this due To your just worth, not you. Ed. Heyward. ON THE AUTHOR, The Poet Laureat, Ben. Jonson. Here is a Poet! whose unmudled straines Show that he held all Helicon in's braines. What here is writ, is sterling; every line Was well-allowed of by the Muses nine. When for the stage a Drama he did lay Tragick or Comick, he still bore away The sock and buskin; clearer notes than his No Swan e're sung upon our Thamesis; For Lyrick sweetnesse in an Ode, or Sonnet To Ben the best of wits might vaile their Bonnet. His Genius justly in an Entheat rage Oft lasht the dull-sworn factors for the stage: For Alchymie though't make a glorious glosse, Compar'd with gold is bullion and base drosse. Wil. Hodgson. On his elaborated Art-contrived Playes. An Epigram. Each like an Indian Ship or Hull appeares That tooke a voyage for some certaine yeares To plow the sea, and furrow up the main, And brought rich Ingots from his loaden brain. His Art the Sunne; his Labours were the lines, His solide stuffe the treasure of his lines. Wil. Hodgson. Upon Sejanus. So brings the wealth-contracting jeweller Pearles and deare stones, from richest shores and streames, As thy accomplisht travaile doth confer From skill-inriched soules, their wealthyer gems; So doth his hand enchase in ammeld gold, Cut, and adorn'd beyond their native merits, His solid flames, as thine hath here inrold In more than golden verse, those better'd spirits; So hee entreasures Princes cabinets, As thy wealth will their wished libraries; So, on the throat of the rude sea, he sets His ventrous foot, for his illustrous prise; And through wilde desarts, arm'd with wilder beasts; As thou adventur'st on the multitude, Vpon the boggie, and engulfed brests Of hyrelings, sworne to finde most right, most rude: And hee, in stormes at sea, doth not endure, Nor in vast desarts, amongst wolves, more danger; Than we, that would with vertue live secure, Sustaine for her in every vices anger. Nor is this Allegorie unjustly rackt, To this strange length: Onely, that jewels are, In estimation meerely, so exact: And thy worke, in it selfe, is deare and rare; Wherein Minerva had beene vanquished, Had shee, by it, her sacred loomes advanc't, And through thy subject woven her graphick thred, Contending therein, to be more entranc't; For, though thy hand was scarce addrest to draw The semi-circle of Sejanus life, Thy Muse yet makes it the whole spheare, and law To all State-lives: and bounds ambition's strife. And as a little brooke creepes from his spring, With shallow tremblings, through the lowest vales, As if he fear'd his streame abroad to bring, Lest prophane feet should wrong it, and rude gales; But finding happie channels, and supplyes Of other foords mixt with his modest course, He growes a goodly river, and descryes The strength, that man'd him, since he left his source; Then takes he in delightsome meades, and groves, And, with his two-edg'd waters, flourishes Before great palaces, and all mens loves Build by his shores, to greet his passages: So thy chaste Muse, by vertuous selfe-mistrust, Which is a true marke of the truest merit; In virgin feare of mens illiterate lust, Shut her soft wings, and durst not shew her spirit; Till, nobly cherisht, now thou lett'st her flie, Singing the sable Orgies of the Muses, And in the highest pitch of TragÅdie, Mak'st her command, all things thy ground produces. Besides, thy PoÃ«me hath this due respect, That it lets passe nothing, without observing, Worthy instruction; or that might correct Rude manners, and renowne the well deserving: Performing such a lively evidence In thy narrations, that thy hearers still Thou turn'st to thy spectators; and the sense That thy spectators have of good or ill, Thou inject'st joyntly to thy readers soules. So deare is held, so deckt thy numerous taske, As thou putt'st handles to the Thespian boules, Or stuck'st rich plumes in the Palladian caske: All thy worth, yet, thy selfe must patronise, By quaffing more of the Castalian head; In expiscation of whose mysteries, Our nets must still be clogg'd, with heavie lead, To make them sinke, and catch: For chearefull gold Was never found in the Pierian streames, But wants, and scornes, and shames for silver sold. What? what shall we elect in these extreames? Now by the shafts of the great Cyrrhan Poet, That beare all light, that is, about the world; I would all dull Poet-haters know it, They shall be soule-bound, and in darknesse hurld, A thousand yeares (as Satan was, their sire) Ere any, worthy the poetique name, (Might I, that warme but at the Muses fire, Presume to guard it) should let deathlesse Fame Light halfe a beame of all her hundred eyes, At his dimme taper, in their memories. Flie, flie, you are too neere; so, odorous flowers Being held too neere the sensor of our sense, Render not pure, nor so sincere their powers, As being held a little distance thence. O could the world but feele how sweet a touch The Knowledge hath, which is in love with goodnesse, (If Poesie were not ravished so much, And her compos'd rage, held the simplest woodnesse, Though of all heats, that temper humane braines, Hers ever was most subtle, high, and holy, First binding savage lives, in civill chaines: Solely religious, and adored solely; If men felt this) they would not think a love, That gives it selfe, in her, did vanities give; Who is (in earth, though low) in worth above, Most able t' honour life, though least to live. And so good Friend, safe passage to thy freight, To thee a long peace, through a vertuous strife, In which, let's both contend to Vertues height, Not making Fame our object, but good life. Geor. Chapman. To His worthy friend, Ben. Ionson. Vpon his Sejanus. In that, this Booke doth deigne Sejanus name, Him unto more, than CÃ¦sars love, it brings: For, where he could not with ambition's wings, One quill doth heave him to the height of Fame. Yee great-ones though (whose ends may be the same) Know, that, how ever we doe flatter Kings, Their favours (like themselves) are fading things, With no lesse envie had, than lost with shame. Nor make your selves lesse honest than you are, To make our Author wiser than he is: Ne of such crimes accuse him, which I dare By all his Muses sweare, be none of his. The men are not, some faults may be these times: He acts those men, and they did act these crimes. Hugh Holland. TO MY FRIEND, M?. Ben. Jonson. Vpon his Alchymist. A master, read in flatteries great skill, Could not passe truth, though he would force his will, By praising this too much, to get more praise In his Art, than you out of yours doe raise. Nor can full truth be utterd of your worth, Unlesse you your owne praises doe set forth: None else can write so skilfully, to shew Your praise: Ages shall pay, yet still must owe. All I dare say, is, you have written well; In what exceeding height, I dare not tell. George Lucy. To my deare friend, M. Ben. Ionson. Vpon his Fox. If it might stand with Iustice, to allow The swift conversion of all follies; now, Such is my Mercy, that I could admit All sorts should equally approve the wit Of this thy even worke: whose growing fame Shall raise thee high, and thou it, with thy name. And did not manners, and my love command Me to forbeare to make those understand, Whom thou, perhaps, hast in thy wiser doome Long since, firmely resolv'd, shall never come To know more than they doe; I would have showne To all the world, the art, which thou alone Hast taught our tongue, the rules of time, of place, And other rites, deliver'd, with the grace Of Comick stile, which only, is farre more, Than any English stage hath knowne before. But, since our subtile gallants think it good To like of nought, that may be understood, Lest they should be disprov'd; or have, at best, Stomacks so raw, that nothing can digest But what's obscene, or barkes: Let us desire They may continue, simply, to admire Fine clothes, and strange words; and may live, in age, To see themselves ill brought upon the stage, And like it. Whilst thy bold, and knowing Muse Contemns all praise, but such as thou wouldst chuse. Franc. Beaumont. UPON THE SILENT WOMAN. Heare you bad Writers, and though you not see, I will informe you where you happie bee: Provide the most malicious thoughts you can, And bend them all against some private man, To bring him, not his vices, on the stage; Your envie shall be clad in some poore rage, And your expressing of him shall be such, That he himselfe shall think he hath no touch. Where he that strongly writes, although he meane To scourge but vices in a labour'd Scene, Yet private faults shall be so well exprest As men doe act 'hem, that each private brest, That findes these errors in it selfe, shall say, He meant mee, not my vices, in the Play. Franc. Beaumont. To my friend M. Ben. Ionson. Vpon his Catiline. If thou had'st itch'd after the wilde applause Of common people, and had'st made thy lawes In writing, such, as catch'd at present voice, I should commend the thing, but not thy choise. But thou hast squar'd thy rules, by what is good; And art, three ages yet, from understood: And (I dare say) in it, there lyes much wit Lost, till thy readers can grow up to it. Which they can ne're out-grow, to finde it ill, But must fall back againe, or like it still. Franc. Beaumont. Song. [Slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt teares] Slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt teares; Yet slower, yet, O faintly gentle springs: List to the heavy part the musick beares, âWoe weeps out her division, when shee sings. Droup hearbs, and flowres; Fall griefe in showres; âOur beauties are not ours: O, I could still (Like melting snow upon some craggy hill,) drop, drop, drop, drop, Since natures pride is, now, a wither'd daffodill. Song. [Come follow me, my wagges, and say as I say.] Come follow me, my wagges, and say as I say. There's no riches but in ragges; hey day, hey day. You that professe this Art, come away, come away, And helpe to beare a part. Hey day; hey day, &amp;c. Song. [O, That joy so soone should waste!] O, That joy so soone should waste! or so sweet a blisse as a kisse, Might not for ever last! So sugred, so melting, so soft, so delicious, The dew that lyes on roses, When the morne her selfe discloses, is not so precious. O, rather than I would it smother, Were I to taste such another; It should bee my wishing That I might die kissing. Song. [Thou more than most sweet glove] Thou more than most sweet glove, Vnto my more sweet love, Suffer mee to store with kisses This emptie lodging, that now misses The pure rosie hand, that ware thee, Whiter than the kid, that bare thee. Thou art soft, but that was softer; Cupids selfe hath kist it ofter, Than e're he did his mothers doves, Supposing her the Queen of loves, That was thy mistresse, Best of gloves. The Hymne. Queene, and Huntresse, chaste, and faire, Now the Sunne is laid to sleepe; Seated, in thy silver chaire, State in wonted manner keepe: Hesperus intreats thy light, Goddesse, excellently bright. Earth, let not thy envious shade Dare it selfe to interpose; Cynthia's shining orbe was made Heaven to cleere, when day did close: Blesse us then with wished sight, Goddesse, excellently bright. Lay thy bow of pearle apart, And thy crystall-shining quiver; Give unto the flying Hart Space to breathe, how short soever: Thou that mak'st a day of night, Goddesse, excellently bright. Song. [If I freely can discover] 1 If I freely can discover, What would please mee in my lover: I would have her faire, and wittie, Savouring more of Court, than Citie; A little proud, but full of pitie: Light, and humorous in her toying. Oft building hopes, and soone destroying; Long, but sweet in the enjoying, Neither too easie, nor too hard: All extremes I would have bard. 2 Shee should be allowed her passions, So they were but us'd as fashions; Sometimes froward, and then frowning, Sometimes sickish and then swowning, Euery fit, with change, still crowning. Purely jealous, I would have her, Then only constant when I crave her. 'Tis a vertue should not save her. Thus, nor her delicates would cloy mee, Neither her peevishnesse annoy mee. [Swell me a bowle with lustie wine] Hor. Swell me a bowle with lustie wine, Till I may see the plump LyÃ¦us swim Above the brim: I drink, as I would write, In flowong measure, fill'd with flame, and sprite. Song. [VVake, our mirth begins to die] VVake, our mirth begins to die: Quicken it with tunes, and wine: Raise your notes, you're out: fie, fie, This drowzinesse is an ill signe. Wee banish him the Quire of Gods, That droops agen: Then all are men, For here's not one, but nods. Herm. Then, in a free and loftie straine, Our broken tunes we thus repaire; Cris. And we answere them againe, Running division on the panting ayre: Ambo. To celebrate this feast of sence, As free from scandall, as offence. Herm. Here is beautie for the eye; Cris. For the eare, sweet melodie; Herm. Ambrosiack odours, for the smell; Cris. Delicious Nectar, for the taste; Ambo. For the touch, a ladies waste; Which doth all the rest excell! Song. [Fools, they are the only nation] Fools, they are the only nation Worth mens envy, or admiration; Free from care, or sorrow-taking, Selves, and others merry-making: All they speake, or doe, is sterling. Your foole he is your great mans darling, And your ladies sport, and pleasure; Tongue, and bable are his treasure. Eene his face begetteth laughter, And hee speaks truth free from slaughter; Hee's the grace of every feast, And, sometimes the chiefest guest: Hath his trencher, and his stoole, When wit waits upon the foole. O, who would not bee Hee, hee, hee? Song. [You that would last long, list to my song] You that would last long, list to my song, Make no more coyle, but buy of this oyle. Would you be ever faire? and yong? Stout of teeth? and strong of tongue? Tart of palat? quick of eare? Sharpe of sight? of nostrill cleare? Moist of hand? and light of foot? (Or I will come neerer to't) Would you live free from all diseases? Doe the act, your mistris pleases; Yea fright all aches from your bones? Here's a med'cine, for the nones. EPIGRAMMES. I. BOOKE. TO THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF Honour, and Vertue, the most noble WILLIAM, Earle of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlaine, &amp;c. I. To the Reader. Pray thee, take care, that tak'st my Book in hand, To read it well: that is, to understand. II. To my Book. It will be look'd for Book, when some but see Thy title, Epigrammes, and nam'd of mee, Thou should'st be bold, licentious, full of gall; Wormewood, and sulphure, sharp, and tooth'd withall, Become a petulant thing, hurle inke, and wit As mad-men stones: not caring whom they hit. Deceive their malice, who could wish it so. And by thy wiser temper, let men know Thou art not covetous of least selfe-Fame, Made from the hazard of anothers shame. Much lesse, with lewd, prophane, and beastly phrase, To catch the worlds loose laughter or vaine gaze. He that departs with his own honesty For vulgar praise, doth it too dearely buy. III. To my Book-seller. Thou, that mak'st gaine thy end, and wisely well, Call'st a Book good, or bad, as it doth sell, Use mine so, too: I give thee leave. But crave For the lucks sake, it thus much favour have, To lie upon thy stall, till it be sought; Not offer'd, as it made sute to be bought; Nor have my title-leafe on posts, or walls, Or in cleft-sticks, advanced to make calls For termers, or some clerck-like serving-man, Who scarce can spell th'hard names: whose Knight lesse can. If, without these vile arts, it will not sell, Send it to Bucklers-bury, there 'twill well. IIII. To King James. How, best of Kings, dost thou a Scepter beare! How, best of Poets, dost thou Laurell weare! But two things rare, the Fates had in their store, And gave thee both, to shew they could no more. For such a Poet, while thy daies were greene, Thou wert, as chiefe of them are said t'have been. And such a Prince thou art we daily see, As chiefe of those still promise they will bee. Whom should my Muse then flye to, but the best Of Kings for grace; of Poets for my test? V. On The Union. When was there contract better driven by Fate? Or celebrated with more truth of State? The World the Temple was, the Priest a King, The spoused paire two Realmes, the Sea the ring, VI. To Alchymists. If all you boast of your great Art be true; Sure, willing poverty lives most in you. VII. On the New Hot-house. Where lately harbourd many a famous whore, A purging bill, now fix'd upon the doore, Tels you it is a Hot-house: so it ma, And still be a whore-house. Th'are Synonyma. VIII. On A Robbery. Ridway rob'd Duncote of three hundred pound, Ridway was tane, arraign'd, condemn'd to dye; But, for this money was a Courtier found, Beg'd Ridwayes pardon: Duncote, now, doth crye; Rob'd both of money, and the laws reliefe; The Courtier is become the greater thiefe. IX. To All, To Whom I Write. May none, whose scatter'd names honor my Book, For strict degrees, of rank, or title look: 'Tis 'gainst the manners of an Epigram: And, I a Poet here, no Herald am. X To My Lord Ignorant. Thou call'st me Poet, as a terme of shame: But I have my revenge made, in thy name. XI. On Some-thing, That Walkes Some-where. At Court I met it, in clothes brave enough, To be a Courtier; and looks grave enough, To seeme a statesman: as I neere it came, It made me a great face, I ask'd the name. A Lord, it cried, buried in flesh, and blood, And such from whom let no man hope least good, For I will do none: and as little ill, For I will dare none. Good Lord, walk dead still. XII. On Lieutenant Shift. Shift, here, in towne, not meanest among Squires, That haunt Pickt-hatch, Mersh-Lambeth, and White-fryers, Keeps himselfe, with halfe a man, and defrayes The charge of that state, with this charme, god payes. By that one spell he lives, eats, drinks, arrayes Himselfe: his whole revenue is, god payes. The quarter day is come; the hostesse sayes, She must have money: he returnes, god payes. The taylor brings a suite home; he it 'ssayes, Looks o're the bill, likes it: and say's, god payes. He steales to Ordinaries; there he playes At dice hisborrow'd money: which, god payes. Then takes up fresh commodities, for dayes; Signes to new bonds, forfeits: and cries, god payes. That lost, he keeps his chamber, reades Essayes, Takes physick, teares the papers: still god payes. Or else by water goes, and so to playes; Calls for his stoole, adornes the stage: god payes. To every cause he meets, this voice he brayes: His only answer is to all, god payes. Not his poore cocatrice but he betrayes Thus: and for his letchery, scores, god payes. But see! th'old baud hath servd him in his trim, Lent him a pocky whore. She hath paid him. XIII. To Doctor Empirick. VVhen men a dangerous disease did scape, Of old, they gave a Cock to Ãsculape; Let me give two: that doubly am got free, From my diseases danger, and from thee. XIV. To William Camden. Camden, most reverend head, to whom I owe All that I am in Arts, all that I know. (How nothing's that?) to whom my Countrey owes The great renowne, and name wherewith she goes. Than thee the age sees not that thing more grave, More high, more holy, that shee more would crave. What name, what skill, what faith hast thou in things! What sight in searching the most antique springs! What weight, and what authority in thy speech! Man scarse can make that doubt, but thou canst teach. Pardon free truth, and let thy modesty, Which conquers all, be once over-come by the Many of thine this better could, than I, But for their powers, accept my piety. XV. On Court-worme. All men are wormes: But this no man. In silke 'Twas brought to Court first wrapt, and white as milke; Where, afterwards, it grew a butter-flye: Which was a cater-piller. So 'twill dye. XVI. To Braine-hardy. Hardy, thy braine is valiant, 'tis confest; Thou more; that with it every day, dar'st jest Thy selfe into fresh braules: when, call'd upon, Scarce thy weeks swearing brings thee of, of one. So, in short time, th'art in arrerage growne Some hundred quarrels, yet dost thou fight none; Nor need'st thou: for those few, by oath releast, Make good what thou dar'st do in all the rest. Keep thy selfe there, and think thy valure right; He that dares damne himselfe, dares more than fight. XVII. To the learned Critick. May others feare, flye, and traduce thy name, As guilty men do Magistrates: glad I, That wish my poemes a legitimate fame, Charge them, for crown, to thy sole censure hye. And, but a sprig of bayes given by thee, Shall out-live garlands, stolne from the chast tree. XVIII. To My Meere English Censurer. To thee, my way in Epigrammes seemes new, When both it is the old way, and the true. Thou saist, that cannot be: for thou hast seene Davis, and Weever, and the best have beene, And mine come nothing like. I hope so. Yet, As theirs did with thee, mine might credit get: If thou 'ldst but use thy faith, as thou didst then, When thou wert wont t'admire, not censure men. Pr'y thee, beleeve still, and not judge so fast, Thy faith is all the knowledge that thou hast. XIX. On Sir Cod The Perfumed. That Cod can get no widdow, yet a Knight, I sente the cause: He wooes with an ill sprite. XX. To The Same Sir Cod [The Perfumed]. Th'expence in odours is a most vaine sin, Except thou couldst, Sir Cod, weare them within. XXI. On Reformed Gam'ster. Lord, how is Gam'ster chang'd! his haire close cut! His neck fenc'd round with ruffe! his eyes halfe shut! His clothes two fashions off, and poore! his sword Forbidd' his side! and nothing, but the word Quick in his lips! who hath this wonder wrought? The late tane bastinado. So I thought. What severall ways men to their calling have! The bodies stripes, I see, the soule may save. XXII. On My First Daughter. Here lies to each her parents ruth, Mary, the daughter of their youth: Yet, all heavens gifts, being heavens due, It makes the father, lesse, to rue. At sixe months end, she parted hence With safety of her innocence; Whose soule heavens Queen, (whose name she beares) In comfort of her mothers teares, Hath plac'd amongst her Virgin-traine: Where, while that sever'd doth remaine, This grave partakes the fleshly birth. Which cover lightly, gentle earth. XXIII. To John Donne. Donne, the delight of PhÅbus, and each Muse, Who, to thy one, all other braines refuse; Whose every work, of thy most early wit, Came forth example, and remaines so, yet: Longer a knowing, than most wits do live; And which no affection praise enough can give! To it, thy language, letters, arts, best life, Which might with halfe mankind maintaine a strife; All which I meane to praise, and, yet, I would; But leave, because I cannot as I should! XXIV. To The Parliament. There's reason good, that you good laws should make: Mens manners ne're were viler, for your sake. XXV. On Sir Voluptuous Beast. VVhile Beast instructs his faire, and innocent wife, In the past pleasures of his sensuall life, Telling the motions of each petticote, And how his Ganimede mov'd, and how his goate, And now, her (hourely) her own cucqueane makes, In varied shapes, which for his lust she takes: What doth he else, but say, leave to be chaste, Just wife, and, to change me, make womans haste. XXVI. On The Same [Sir Voluptuous] Beast. Than his chast wife, though Beast now know no more, He 'adulters still: his thoughts lye with a whore. XXVII. On Sir John Roe. In place of scutcheons, that should decke thy herse, Take better ornaments, my teares, and verse. If any sword could save from Fates, Roe's could; If any Muse out-live their spight, his can; If any friends teares could restore, his would; If any pious life ere lifted man To heaven; his hath: O happy State! wherein We, sad for him, may glory, and not sin. XXVIII. On Don Surly. Don Surly, to aspire the glorious name Of a great man, and to be thought the same, Makes serious use of all great trade he knowes. He speakes to men with a Rhinocerotes nose, Which hee thinks great; and so reades verses, too: And that is done, as he saw great men doe. H'has tympanies of businesse, in his face, And, can forget mens names, with a great grace. He will both argue, and discourse in oathes, Both which are great. And laugh at ill made cloathes; That's greater, yet: to crie his owne up neat. He doth, at meales, alone, his pheasant eat, Which is maine greatnesse. And, at his still boord, He drinks to no man: that's, too, like a lord. He keeps anothers wife, which is a spice Of solemne greatnesse. And he dares, at dice, Blaspheme God, greatly. Or some poore hinde beat, That breathes in his dogs way: and this is great. Nay more, for greatnesse sake, he will be one May heare my Epigrammes, but like of none. Surly, use other arts, these only can Stile thee a most great foole, but no great man. XXIX. To Sir Annual Tilter. Tilter, the most may admire thee, though not I: And thou, right guiltlesse, may'st plead to it, why? For thy late sharpe device. I say 'tis fit All braines, at times of triumph, should runne wit. For then, our water-conduits doe runne wine; But that's put in, thou'lt say. Why, so is thine. XXX. To Person Guiltie. Guiltie, be wise; and though thou know'st the crimes Be thine, I tax, yet doe not owne my rimes: 'Twere madnesse in thee, to betray thy fame, And person to the world; ere I thy name. XXXI. On Banck The Usurer. Banck feeles no lamenesse of his knottie gout, His moneyes travaile for him, in and out: And though the soundest legs goe every day, He toyles to be at hell, as soone as they. XXXII. On Sir John Roe. VVhat two brave perills of the the private sword Could not effect, nor all the Furies doe, That selfe-divided Belgia did afford; What not the envie of the seas reach'd too, The cold of Mosco, and fat Irish ayre, His often change of clime (though not of mind) What could not work; at home in his repaire Was his blest fate, but our hard lot to find. Which shewes, where ever death doth please t'appeare, Seas, serenes, swords, shot, sicknesse, all are there. XXXIII. To The Same [Sir John Roe]. Ile not offend thee with a vaine teare more, Glad-mention'd Roe: thou art but gone before, Whither the world must follow. And I, now, Breathe to expect my when, and make my how. Which if most gracious heaven grant like thine, Who wets my grave, can be no friend of mine. XXXIV. Of Death. He that feares Death, or mournes it, in the just, Shewes of the Resurrection little trust. XXXV. To King James. Who would not be thy subject James, t'obay A Prince, that rules by'example, more than sway? Whose manners draw, more than thy powers constraine. And in this short time of thy happiest raigne, Hast purg'd thy Realmes, as we have now no cause Left us of feare, but first our crimes, then lawes. Like aydes 'gainst treasons who hath found before? And then in them, how could we know God more? First thou preserved wert, our King to bee, And since, the whole Land was preserv'd for thee. XXXVI. To The Ghost Of Martial. Martial, thou gav'st farre nobler Epigrammes To thy Domitian, than I can my James: But in my royall subject I passe thee, Thou flattered'st thine, mine cannot flatter'd bee. XXXVII. On Chev'rill The Lawyer. No cause, nor client fat, will Chev'rill leese, But as they come, on both sides he takes fees, And pleaseth both. For while he melts his grease For this: that winnes, for whom he holds his peace. XXXVIII. To Person Guiltie. Guiltie, because I bade you late be wise, And to conceale your ulcers, did advise, You laugh when you are touch'd, and long before Any man else, you clap your hands, and rore, And cry good! good! This quite perverts my sense, And lyes so farre from wit, 'tis impudence. Beleeve it, Guiltie, if you lose your shame, I'le lose my modestie, and tell your name. XXXIX. On Old Colt. For all night-sinnes, with other wives, unknown, Colt, now, doth daily penance in his own. XL. On Margaret Ratcliffe. Marble, weepe, for thou do'st cover A dead beautie under-neath thee, Rich as nature could bequeath thee; Grant then, no rude hand remove her. All the gazers on the skies Read not in faire heavens storie, Expresser truth, or truer glorie, Than they might in her bright eyes. Rare as wonder was her wit; And like Nectar ever flowing: Till time, strong by her bestowing, Conquer'd hath both life and it. Life whose griefe was out of fashion; In these times few so have ru'd Fate in a brother. To conclude, For wit, feature, and true passion, Earth, thou hast not such another. XLI. On Gypsee. Gypsee, new baud, is turn'd Physitian, And gets more gold than all the Colledge can: Such her quaint practice is, so it allures, For what she gave, a whore; a baud, she cures. XLII. On Giles And Jone. Who sayes that Giles and Jone at discord be? Th' observing neighbours no such mood can see. Indeed, poore Giles repents he married ever. But that his Jone doth too. And Giles would never, By his free-will, be in Jones company. No more would Jone he should. Giles riseth early, And having got him out of doores is glad. The like is Jone. But turning home is sad. And so is Jone. Oft-times when Giles doth finde Harsh sights at home, Giles wisheth he were blind. All this doth Jone. Or that his long-yearn'd life Were quite out-spun. The like wish hath his wife. The children, that he keepes, Giles sweares are none Of his begetting. And so sweares his Jone. In all affections she concurreth still. If, now, with man and wife, to will, and nill The selfe-same things, a note of concord bee: I know no couple better can agree! XLIII. To Robert Earle Of Salisburie. VVhat need hast thou of me? or of my Muse? Whose actions so themselves doe celebrate? Which should thy countryes love to speake refuse, Her foes enough would fame thee in their hate. 'Tofore, great men were glad of Poets: Now, I, not the worst, am covetous of thee. Yet dare not to my thought least hope allow Of adding to thy fame; thine may to me, When in my Book, men reade but Cecil's name, And what I writ thereof finde farre, and free From servile flatterie (common Poets shame) As thou stand'st cleare of the necessitie. XLIV. On Chuffe, Banks The Usurer's Kinsman. Chuffe, lately rich in name, in chattels, goods, And rich in issue to inherit all, Ere blacks were bought for his owne funerall, Saw all his race approach the blacker floods: He meant they thither should make swift repaire, When he made him executor, might be heire. XLV. On My First Sonne. Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy; My sinne was too much hope of thee, lov'd boy, Seven yeares tho' wert lent to me, and I thee pay, Exacted by thy fate on the just day. O, could I lose all father, now. For why, Will man lament the state he should envie? To have so soone scap'd worlds, and fleshes rage, And, if no other miserie, yet age? Rest in soft peace, and ask'd, say here doth lye Ben. Jonson his best piece of Poetrie. For whose sake, hence-forth, all his vowes be such, As what hee loves may never like too much. XLVI. To Sir Lucklesse Woo-All. Is this the Sir, who, some waste wife to winne, A Knight-hood bought, to goe a wooing in? 'Tis Lucklesse he, that tooke up one on band To pay at's day of marriage. By my hand The knight-wright's cheated then: Hee'll never pay. Yes, now he weares his knight-hood every day. XLVII. To The Same [Sir Lucklesse Woo-All]. Sir Lucklesse, troth, for lucks sake passe by one: Hee that wooes every widdow, will get none. XLVIII. On Mungril Esquire. His bought armes Mung' not lik'd; for his first day Of bearing them in field, he threw 'hem away: And hath no honour lost our Due'llists say. XLIX. To Play-wright. Play-wright me reades, and still my verses damnes, He sayes, I want the tongue of Epigrammes; I have no salt: no bawdrie he doth meane; For wittie, in his language, is obscene. Play-wright, I loath to have thy manners knowne In my chast booke: professe them in thine owne. L. To Sir Cod. Leave Cod, Tabacco-like, burnt gummes to take, Or fumie clysters, thy moist lungs to bake: Arsenike would thee fit for societie make. LI. To King James. Vpon the happie false rumour of his death, the two and twentieth day of March, 1607. That we thy losse might know, and thou our love, Great heav'n did well, to give ill fame free wing; Which though it did but panick terror prove, And farre beneath least pause of such a King, Yet give thy jealous subjects leave to doubt: Who this thy scape from rumour gratulate, No lesse than if from perill; and devout, Doe beg thy care unto thy after-state. For we, that have our eyes still in our eares, Looke not upon thy dangers, but our feares. LII. To Censorious Courtling. Courtling, I rather thou should'st utterly Dispraise my Work, than praise it frostily: When I am read, thou fain'st a weak applause, As if thou wert my friend, but lack'dst a cause. This but thy judgement fooles: the other way Would both thy folly, and thy spite betray. LIII. To Old-end Gatherer. Long-gathering Old-end, I did feare thee wise, When having pill'd a book, which no man buyes, Thou wert content the authors name to loose: But when (in place) thou didst the patrons choose, It was as if thou printed had'st an oath, To give the world assurance thou wert both; And that, as Puritanes at baptisme doe, Thou art the father, and the witnesse too. For, but thy selfe, where, out of motly, 's hee Could save that line to dedicate to thee? LIV. On Chev'ril. Chev'ril cryes out, my verses libells are; And threatens the Starre-chamber, and the barre. What are thy petulant pleadings, Chev'ril, then, That quit'st the cause so oft, and rayl'st at men? LV. To Francis Beaumont. How I doe love thee Beaumont, and thy Muse, That unto me dost such religion use! How I doe feare my selfe, that am not worth The least indulgent thought thy pen drops forth! At once thou mak'st me happie, and unmak'st; And giving largely to me, more thou tak'st. What fate is mine, that so it selfe bereaves? What art is thine, that so thy friend deceives? When even there, where most thou praisest mee, For writing better, I must envie thee. LVI. On Poet-Ape. Poore Poet-Ape, that would be thought our chiefe, Whose Works are eene the frippery of wit, From brocage is become so bold a theefe, As we, the rob'd, leave rage, and pitie it. At first he made low shifts, would pick and gleane, Buy the reversion of old Playes; now growne To'a little wealth, and credit in the Scene, He takes up all, makes each mans wit his owne. And, told of this, he slights it. Tut, such crimes The sluggish gaping auditor devoures; He markes not whose 'twas first: and after-times May judge it to be his, as well as ours. Foole, as if halfe eyes will not know a fleece From locks of wooll, or shreds from the whole peece? LVII. On Baudes, And Usurers. If, as their ends, their fruits were so the same, Baudry', and Usury were one kind of game. LVIII. To Groome Ideot. Ideot, last night, I pray'd thee but forbeare To reade my verses; now I must to heare: For offring, with thy smiles, my wit to grace, Thy ignorance still laughs in the wrong place. And so my sharpnesse thou no lesse dis-joynts, Than thou did'st late my sense, loosing my points. So have I seene at Christ-masse sports, one lost, And, hood-wink'd, for a man, embrace a post. LIX. On Spies. Spies, you are lights in State, but of base stuffe, Who, when you'have burnt your selves downe to the snuffe, Stinke, and are throwne away. End faire enough. LX. To William Lord Mounteagle. Loe, what my Countrey should have done (have rais'd An obeliske, or columne to thy name, Or, if shee would but modestly have prais'd Thy fact, in brasse or marble writ the same) I, that am glad of thy great chance, here doe! And proud, my worke shall out-last common deeds, Durst thinke it great, and worthy wonder too, But thine, for which I doo't, so much exceeds! My countries parents I have many knowne; But Saver of my countrey thee alone. LXI. To Foole, Or Knave. Thy praise, or dispraise is to me alike; One doth not stroke me, nor the other strike. LXII. To Fine Lady Would-bee. Fine Madam Would-bee, wherfore should you feare, That love to make so well, a child to beare? The world reputes you barren: but I know Your' pothecary, and his drug sayes no. Is it the paine affrights? that's soone forgot. Or your complexions losse? you have a pot, That can restore that. Will it hurt your feature? To make amends, yo'are thought a wholesome creature. What should the cause be? Oh, you live at Court: And there's both losse of time, and losse of sport In a great belly. Write, then on thy wombe; Of the not borne, yet buried, here's the tombe. LXIII. To Robert Earle Of Salisburie. Who can consider thy right courses run, With what thy vertue on the times hath won, And not thy fortune; who can clearely see The judgement of the King so shine in thee; And that thou seek'st reward of thy each act, Not from the publick voyce, but private fact; Who can behold all envie so declin'd By constant suffring of thy equall mind; And can to these be silent, Salisburie, Without his, thine, and all times injurie? Curst be his Muse, that could lye dumbe, or hid To so true worth, though thou thy selfe forbid. LXIV. To The Same [Robert Earle Of Salisburie]. Vpon the accession of the Treasurership to him. Not glad, like those that have new hopes, or suites, With thy new place, bring I these early fruits Of love, and what the golden age did hold A treasure, art: condemn'd in th'age of gold. Nor glad as those, that old dependents bee, To see thy Fathers rites new laid on thee. Nor glad for fashion. Nor to shew a fit Of flattery to thy titles. Nor of wit. But I am glad to see that time survive, Where merit is not sepulcher'd alive. Where good mens vertues them to honours bring, And not to dangers. When so wise a King Contends t'have Worth enjoy, from his regard, As her owne conscience, still, the same reward. These (noblest Cecil) labour'd in my thought, Wherein what wonder see thy name hath brought? That whil'st I meant but thine to gratulate, I'have sung the greater fortunes of our State. LXV. To My Muse. Away, and leave me, thou thing most abhord That hast betray'd me to a worthlesse lord; Made me commit most fierce idolatrie To a great Image through thy luxurie. Be thy next masters more unluckie Muse, And, as thou'hast mine, his houres, and youth abuse. Get him the Times long grudge, the Courts ill will; And reconcil'd, keepe him suspected still. Make him lose all his friends; and, which is worse, Almost all wayes, to any better course. With mee thou leav'st an happier Muse than thee, And which thou brought'st me, welcome povertie. Shee shall instruct my after-thoughts to write Things manly, and not smelling parasite. But I repent me: Stay. Who e're is rais'd, For worth he has not, He is tax'd, not prais'd. LXVI. To Sir Henry Cary. That neither fame, nor love might wanting be To greatnesse, Cary, I sing that, and thee. Whose House, if it no other honour had, In onely thee, might be both great, and glad. Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time, Durst valour make, almost, but not a crime. Which deed I know not, whether were more high, Or thou more happie, it to justifie Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day, Could conquer thee, but chance, who did betray. Love thy great losse, which a renowne hath wonne, The Castle and River neere where hee was taken.To live when Broeck not stands, nor Roor doth runne. Love honours, which of best example bee, When they cost dearest, and are done most free. Though every fortitude deserves applause, It may be much, or little, in the cause. Hee's valiant'st, that dares fight, and not for pay; That vertuous is, when the reward's away. LXVII. To Thomas Earle Of Suffolke. Since men have left to doe praise-worthy things, Most think all praises flatteries. But truth brings That sound, and that authority with her name, As, to be rais'd by her, is onely fame. Stand high, then, Howard, high in eyes of men, High in thy blood, thy place, but highest then, When, in mens wishes, so thy vertues wrought, As all thy honours were by them first sought: And thou design'd to be the same thou art, Before thou wert it, in each good mans heart. Which, by no lesse confirm'd, than thy Kings choice, Proves, that is God's, which was the peoples voice. LXVIII. On Play-wright. Play-wright convict of publick wrongs to men, Takes private beatings, and begins againe. Two kinds of valour he doth shew at ones; Active in's braine, and passive in his bones. LXIX. To Pertinax Cob. Cob, thou nor souldier, theefe, nor fencer art, Yet by thy weapon liv'st! Th'hast one good part. LXX. To William Roe. When Nature bids us leave to live, 'tis late Then to begin, my Roe. He makes a state In life, that can employ it; and takes hold On the true causes, ere they grow too old. Delay is bad, doubt worse, depending worst; Each best day of our life escapes us, first. Then, since we (more than many) these truths know: Though life be short, let us not make it so. LXXI. On Court-Parrat. To pluck downe mine, Poll sets up new wits still, Still, 'tis his luck to praise me 'gainst his will. LXXII. To Court-ling. I grieve not, Court-ling, thou art started up A chamber-critick, and dost dine, and sup At Madames table, where thou mak'st all wit Goe high, or low, as thou wilt value it. 'Tis not thy judgement breeds the prejudice, Thy person only, Courtling, is the vice. LXXIII. To Fine Grand. VVhat is't, fine Grand, makes thee my friend-ship flie, Or take an Epigramme so fearefully: As't were a challenge, or a borrowers letter? The world must know your greatnesse is my debter. In-primis, Grand, you owe me for a jest; I lent you, on meere acquaintance, at a feast. Item, a tale or two, some fortnight after; That yet maitaines you, and your house in laughter. Item, the Babylonian song you sing; Item, a faire Greeke poesie for a ring: With which a learned Madame you belye. Item, a charme surrounding fearefully, Your partie-per-pale picture, one halfe drawne In solemne cypres, the other cob-web-lawne. Item, a gulling imprese for you, at tilt. Item, your mistris anagram, i' your hilt. Item, your owne, sew'd in your mistris smock. Item, an Epitaph on my lords cock, In most vile verses, and cost me more paine, Than had I made 'hem good, to fit your vaine. Fortie things more, deare Grand, which you know true, For which, or pay me quickly, or I'le pay you. LXXIV. To Thomas Lord Chancelor. VVhil'st thy weigh'd judgements, Egerton, I heare, And know thee, then, a judge, not of one yeare; Whil'st I behold thee live with purest hands; That no affection in thy voyce commands; That still th' art present to the better cause; And no lesse wise, than skilfull in the Lawes; Whil'st thou art certaine to thy words, once gone, As is thy conscience, which is alwayes one: The Virgin, long-since fled from earth, I see, T' our times return'd, hath made her heaven in thee. LXXV. On Lippe, The Teacher. I cannot think there's that antipathy 'Twixt Puritanes, and Players, as some cry; Though Lippe, at Pauls, ranne from his text away, T' inveigh 'gainst Playes: what did he then but play? LXXVI. On Lucy Countesse Of Bedford. This morning, timely rapt with holy fire, I thought to forme unto my zealous Muse, What kinde of creature I could most desire, To honour, serve, and love; as Poets use. I meant to make her faire, and free, and wise, Of greatest blood, and yet more good than great, I meant the day-starre should not brighter rise, Nor lend like influence from his lucent seat. I meant she should be courteous, facile sweet, Hating that solemne vice of Greatnesse, pride; I meant each softest vertue, there should meet, Fit in that softer bosome to reside. Only a learned, and a manly soule I purpos'd her; that should, with even powers, The rock, the spindle, and the sheeres controule Of Destinie, and spin her owne free houres. Such when I meant to faine, and wish'd to see, My Muse bade, Bedford write, and that was shee. LXXVII. To One That Desired Me Not To Name Him. Be safe, nor feare thy selfe so good a fame, That, any way, my booke should speake thy name: For, if thou shame, ranck'd with my friends, to goe, I' am more asham'd to have thee thought my foe. LXXVIII. To Hornet. Hornet, thou hast thy wife drest, for the stall, To draw thee custome: but her selfe gets all. LXXIX. To Elizabeth Countesse Of Rutland. That Poets are farre rarer births than Kings, Your noblest father prov'd: like whom, before, Or then, or since, about our Muses springs, Came not that soule exhausted so their store. Hence was it, that the Destinies decreed (Save that most masculine issue of his braine) No male unto him: who could so exceed Nature, they thought, in all, that he would faine. At which, shee happily displeas'd, made you: On whom, if he were living now, to look, He should those rare, and absolute numbers view, As he would burne, or better farre his book. LXXX. Of Life and Death. The ports of Death are sins; of Life, good deeds: Through which, our merit leads us to our meeds. How wilfull blind is he then, that should stray, And hath it, in his powers, to make his way! This World Deaths region is, the other Lifes: And here, it should be one of our first strifes, So to front death, as men might judge us past it. For good men but see Death, the wicked tast it. LXXXI. To Proule The Plagiary. Forbeare to tempt me, Proule, I will not show A line unto thee, till the World it know; Or that I'have by two good sufficient men, To be the wealthy witnesse of my pen: For all thou hear'st, thou swear'st thy selfe didst doo. Thy wit lives by it, Proule, and belly too. Which, if thou leave not soone (though I am loth) I must a libell make, and cozen both. LXXXII. On Cashierd Capt. Surly. Surly's old whore in her new silks doth swim: He cast, yet keeps her well! No, she keeps him. LXXXIII. To A Friend. To put out the word, whore, thou do'st me woo, Throughout my Book. 'Troth put out woman too. LXXXIV. To Lucy Countesse Of Bedford. Madame, I told you late, how I repented, I ask'd a Lord a Buck, and he denied me; And, ere I could aske you, I was prevented: For your most noble offer had supply'd me. Straight went I home; and there most like a Poet, I fancied to my selfe, what wine, what wit I would have spent: how every Muse should know it, And PhÅbus-selfe should be at eating it. O Madame, if your grant did thus transfer me, Make it your gift. See whither that will beare me. LXXXV. To Sir Henry Goodyere. Goodyere, I'am glad, and gratefull to report, My selfe a witnesse of thy few dayes sport: Where I both learn'd, why wise-men hawking follow, And why that bird was sacred to Apollo, Shee doth instruct men by her gallant flight, That they to knowledge so should toure upright, And never stoope, but to strike ignorance: Which if they misse, they yet should re-advance To former height, and there in circle tarrie, Till they be sure to make the foole their quarrie. Now, in whose pleasures I have this discerned, What would his serious actions me have learned? LXXXVI. To The Same [Sir Henry Goodyere]. VVhen I would know thee Goodyere, my thought looks Upon thy well-made choise of friends, and books; Then doe I love thee, and behold thy ends In making thy friends books, and thy books friends: Now, I must give thy life, and deed, the voyce Attending such a studie, such a choyce. Where, though 't be love, that to thy praise doth move, It was a knowledge, that begat that love. LXXXVII. On Captaine Hazard The Cheater. Touch'd with the sinne of false play, in his punque, Hazard a month forswore his; and grew drunke, Each night, to drowne his cares: But when the gaine Of what she had wrought came in, and wak'd his braine, Upon th' accompt, hers grew the quicker trade. Since when, hee's sober againe, and all play's made. LXXXVIII. On English Mounsieur. Would you beleeve, when you this Mounsieur see, That his whole body should speake french, not he? That so much skarfe of France, and hat, and fether, And shooe, and tye, and garter should come hether, And land on one, whose face durst never bee Toward the sea, farther than halfe-way tree? That he, untravell'd, should be french so much, As French-men in his company, should seeme Dutch? Or had his father, when he did him get, The french disease, with which he labours yet? Or hung some Mounsieurs picture on the wall, By which his damme conceiv'd him clothes and all? Or is it some french statue? No: 'T doth move, And stoope, and cringe. O then, it needs must prove The new French-taylors motion, monthly made, Daily to turne in Pauls, and helpe the trade. LXXXIX. To Edward Allen. If Rome so great, and in her wisest age, Fear'd not to boast the glories of her stage, As skilfull Roscius, and grave Ãsope, men, Yet crown'd with honors, as with riches, then; Who had no lesse a trumpet of their name, Than Cicero, whose every breath was fame: How can so great example dye in me, That Allen, I should pause to publish thee? Who both their graces in thy selfe hast more Out-stript, than they did all that went before: And present worth in all dost so contract, As others speak, but only thou dost act. Weare this renowne. 'Tis just, that who did give So many Poets life, by one should live. XC. On Mill. My Ladies Woman. When Mill first came to Court, the unprofiting foole, Unworthy such a mistris, such a schoole, Was dull, and long, ere she would go to man: At last, ease, appetite, and example wan The nicer thing to taste her Ladies page; And, finding good security in his age, Went on: and proving him still, day by day, Discern'd no difference of his yeares, or play. Not though that haire grew browne, which once was amber, And he growne youth, was call'd to his Ladies chamber, Still Mill continu'd: Nay, his face growing worse, And he remov'd to gent'man of the horse, Mill was the same. Since, both his body and face Blown up; and he (too 'unwieldly for that place) Hath got the Stewards chaire; he will not tarry Longer a day, but with his Mill will marry. And it is hop'd, that she, like Milo, will First bearing him a calfe, beare him a bull. XCI. To Sir Horace Vere. Which of thy names I take, not only beares A Romane sound, but Romane vertue weares, Illustrous Vere, or Horace; fit to be Sung by a Horace, or a Muse as free; Which thou art to thy selfe: whose fame was won In th'eye of Europe, where thy deeds were done, When on thy trumpet she did sound a blast, Whose rellish to eternity shall last. I leave thy acts, which should I prosequute Throughout, might flatt'ry seeme; and to be mute To any one, were envy: which would live Against my grave, and time could not forgive. I speake thy other graces, not lesse shown, Nor lesse in practice; but lesse mark'd, lesse known: Humanity, and piety, which are As noble in great Chiefes, as they are rare; And best become the valiant man to weare, Who more should seek mens reverence, than feare. XCII. The New Cry. Ere Cherries ripe, and Straw-berries be gone, Unto the cryes of London I'le adde one; Ripe Statesmen, ripe: They grow in every street; At sixe and twenty, ripe. You shall 'hem meet, And have 'hem yeeld no savour, but of State. Ripe are their ruffes, their cuffes, their beards, their gate, And grave as ripe, like mellow as their faces. They know the States of Christendome, not the places: Yet have they seen the maps, and bought 'hem too, And understand 'hem, as most chapmen do. The counsels, projects, practises they know, And what each Prince doth for intelligence owe, And unto whom: They are the almanacks For twelves yeares yet to come, what each State lacks. They carry in their pockets Tacitus, And the Gazetti, or Gallo-Belgicus: And talke reserv'd, look'd up, and full of feare, Nay, aske you, how the day goes, in your eare. Keep a Starre-chamber sentence close, twelve dayes: And whisper what a Proclamation sayes. They meet in sixes, and at every mart, Are sure to con'the catalogue by heart; Or, every day, some one at Rimee's looks, Or Bils, and there he buyes the names of books. They all get Porta, for the sundry wayes To write in cypher, and the severall keyes, To ope' the character. They 'have found the sleight With juyce of limons, onions, pisse, to write; To breake up seales, and close 'hem. And they know, If the States make peace, how it will go With England. All forbidden books they get. And of the poulder-plot, they will talke yet. At naming the French King, their heads they shake, And at the Pope, and Spaine slight faces make. Or 'gainst the Bishops, for the Brethren, raile, Much like those Brethren; thinking to prevaile With ignorance on us, as they have done On them: And therefore do not only shun Others more modest, but contemne us too, That know not so much State, wrong, as they do. XCIII. To Sir John Radcliffe. How like a Columne, Radcliffe, left alone For the great marke of vertue, those being gone Who did, alike with thee, thy house up-beare, Stand'st thou, to shew the times what you all were? Two bravely in the battaile fell, and dy'd, In Ireland. Upbraiding rebells armes, and barbarous pride: And two, that would have falle as great, as they, The Belgick fever ravished away. Thou, that art all their valour, all their spirit, And thine own goodnesse to encrease thy merit, Than whose I do not know a whiter soule, Nor could I, had I seen all Natures roule, Thou yet remayn'st, un-hurt, in peace, or war, Though not unprov'd: which shews, thy fortunes are Willing to expiate the fault in thee, Wherewith, against thy blood, they offenders be. XCIV. To Lucy, Countesse Of Bedford, With M?. Donnes Satyres. Lucy, you brightnesse of our Spheare, who are Life of the Muses day, their morning Starre! If works (not th'Authors) their own grace should look, Whose poemes would not wish to be your book But these, desir'd by you, the makers ends Crown with their own. Rare Poemes aske rare friends. Yet, Satyres, since the most of mankind bee Their un-avoided subject, fewest see: For none ere tooke that pleasure in sins sense, But, when they hard it tald, took more offence. They, then, that living where the matter is bred, Dare for these Poems, yet, both as be, and read, And like them too; must needfully, though few, Be of the best: and 'mongst those best are you; Lucy, you brightnesse of our Spheare, who are The Muses evening, as their morning-Starre. XCV. To Sir Henry Savile. If, my religion safe, I durst embrace That stranger doctrine of Pythagoras, I should beleeve, the soule of Tacitus In thee, most weighty Savile, liv'd to us: So hast thou rendred him in all his bounds, And all his numbers, both of sense, and sounds. But when I read that speciall piece, restor'd, Where Nero falls, and Galba is ador'd, To thine owne proper I ascribe then more; And gratulate the breach, I griev'd before: Which Fate (it seemes) caus'd in the historie, Only to boast thy merit in supply. O, would'st thou adde like hand, to all the rest! Or, better worke! were thy glad Countrey blest, To have her storie woven in thy thred; Minervaes loome was never richer spred. For who can master those great parts like thee, That liv'st from hope, from feare, from faction free; That hast thy brest so cleere of present crimes, Thou need'st not shrinke at voyce of after-times; Whose knowledge claymeth at the helme to stand; But, wisely, thrusts not forth a forward hand, No more than Salust in the Romane State! As, then, his cause, his glorie emulate. Although to write be lesser than to doo, It is the next deed, and a great one too. We need a man that knowes the severall graces Of Historie, and how to apt their places; Where brevitie, where splendor, and where height. Where sweetnesse is required, and where weight; We need a man, can speake of the intents, The counsells, actions, orders, and events Of State, and censure them: we need his pen Can write the things, the causes, and the men. But most we need is faith (and all have you) That dares not write things false, nor hide things true. XCVI. To John Donne. VVho shall doubt, Donne, where I a Poet bee, When I dare send my Epigrammes to thee? That so alone canst judge, so' alone do'st make: And, in thy censures, evenly, do'st take As free simplicitie, to dis-avow, As thou hast best authoritie, t'allow. Read all I send: and, if I finde but one Mark'd by thy hand, and with the better stone, My title's seal'd. Those that for claps doe write, Let pui'nees, porters, players praise delight, And, till they burst, their backs, like asses load: A man should seeke great glorie, and not broad. XCVII. On The New Motion. See you yond' Motion? Not the old Fa-ding, Nor Captayne Pod, nor yet the Eltham-thing; But one more rare, and in the case so new: His cloake with orient velvet quite lin'd through; His rosie tyes and garters so ore-blowne, By his each glorious parcell to be knowne! He wont was to encounter me, aloud, Where ere he met me; now hee's dumbe, or proud. Know you the cause? H' has neither land, nor lease, Nor baudie stock, that travells for encrease, Nor office in the towne, nor place in Court, Nor 'bout the Beares, nor noyse to make lords sport. He is no favorites favorite, no deare trust Of any Madames, hath neadd squires, and must. Nor did the king of Denmarke him salute, When he was here. Not hath he got a sute, Since he was gone, more than the one he weares. Nor are the Queenes most honor'd maids by th'eares About his forme. What then so swels each lim? Only his clothes have over-leaven'd him. XCVIII. To Sir Thomas Roe. Thou hast begun well, Roe, which stand well too, And I know nothing more thou hast to doo. He that is round within himselfe, and streight, Need seeke no other strength, no other height; Fortune upon him breaks her selfe, if ill, And what would hurt his vertue, makes it still. That thou at once, then, nobly mayst defend With thine owne course the judgement of thy friend, Be alwayes to thy gather'd selfe the same: And studie conscience, more than thou would'st fame. Though both be good, the latter yet is worst, And ever is ill got without the first. XCIX. To The Same [Sir Thomas Roe]. That thou hast kept thy love, encreast thy will, Better'd thy trust to letters; that thy skill; Hast taught thy selfe worthy thy pen to tread, And that to write things worthy to be read: How much of great example wert thou, Roe, If time to facts, as unto men would owe? But much it now availes, what's done, of whom: The selfe-same deeds, as diversly they come, From place, or fortune, are made high, or low, And even the praisers judgement suffers so. Well, though thy name lesse than our great ones bee, Thy fact is more: let truth encourage thee. C. On Play-wright. Play-wright, by chance, hearing some toyes I' had writ, Cry'd to my face, they were th' elixir of wit: And I must now beleeve him: for, to day, Five of my jests, then stolne, past him a play. CI. Inviting A Friend To Supper. To night, grave sir, both my poore house, and I Doe equally desire your company: Not that we think us worthy such a ghest, But that your worth will dignifie our feast, With those that come; whose grace may make that seeme Something, which, else, could hope for no esteeme. It is the faire acceptance, Sir, creates The entertaynment perfect: not the cates. Yet shall you have, to rectifie your palate, An olive, capers, or some better sallad Ushring the mutton; with a short-leg'd hen, If we can get her, full of eggs, and then, Limons, and Wine for sauce: to these, a coney Is not to be despair'd of, for our money; And, though fowle, now, be scarce, yet there are clarks, The skie not falling, think we may have larks. I'le tell you of more, and lye, so you will come: Of partrich, phesant, wood-cock, of which some May yet be there; and godwit, if we can: Knat, raile, and ruffe too. How so ere, my man Shall reade a peece of Virgil, Tacitus, Livie, or of some better booke to us, Of which wee'll speake our minds, amidst our meate; And I'le professe no verses to repeate: To this, if ought appeare, which I know not of, That will the pastrie, not my paper, show of. Digestive cheese, and fruit there sure will bee; But that, which most doth take my Muse, and mee, Is a pure cup of rich Canary-wine, Which is the Mermaids, now, but shall bee mine: Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted, Their lives, as doe their lines, till now had lasted. Tabacco, Nectar, or the Thespian spring, Are all but Luthers beere, to this I sing. Of this we will sup free, but moderately, And wee will have no Pooly', or Parrot by; Nor shall our cups make any guiltie men: But, at our parting, we will be, as when We innocently met. No simple word, That shall be utter'd at our mirthfull boord, Shall make us sad next morning: or affright The libertie, that wee'le enjoy to night. CII. To William Earle Of Pembroke. I doe but name thee Pembroke, and I finde It is an Epigramme, on all man-kinde; Against the bad, but of, and to be good: Both which are ask'd, to have thee understood. Nor could the age have mist thee, in this strife Of vice, and vertue; wherein all great life Almost, is exercis'd: and scarce one knows, To which, yet, of the sides himselfe he owes. They follow vertue, for reward, to day; To morrow vice, if she give better pay: And are so good, or bad, just at a price, As nothing else discernes the vertue or vice. But thou whose noblesse keepes one stature still, And one true posture, though besieg'd with ill Of what ambition, faction, pride can raise; Whose life, ev'n they, that envie it, must praise; That art so reverenc'd, as thy comming in, But in the view, doth interrupt their sinne; Thou must draw more: and they, that hope to see The Common-wealth still safe, must studie thee. CIII. To Mary Lady Wroth. How well, faire crowne of your faire sex, might he, That but the twi-light of your sprite did see, And noted for what flesh such soules were fram'd, Know you to be a Sydney, though un-nam'd? And, being nam'd, how little doth that name Need any Muses praise to give it fame? Which is, it selfe, the imprese of the great, And glorie of them all, but to repeate! Forgive me then, if mine but say you are A Sydney: but in that extend as farre As lowdest praisers, who perhaps would finde For every part a character assign'd. My praise is plaine, and where so ere profest, Becomes none more than you, who need it least. CIV. To Susan Countesse Of Montgomery. Were they that nam'd you, Prophets? Did they see, Even in the dew of grace, what you would bee? Or did our times require it, to behold A new Susanna, equall to that old? Or, because some scarce think that story true, To make those faithfull, did the Fates send you? And to your Scene lent no lesse dignitie Of birth, of match, of forme, of chastitie? Or, more than borne for the comparison Of former age, or glory of our one, Were you advanced, past those times to be The light, and marke unto posteritie? Judge they, that can: Here I have rais'd to show A picture, which the world for yours must know, And like it too; if they looke equally: If not, 'tis fit for you, some should envy. CV. To Mary Lady Wroth. Madame, had all antiquitie been lost, All history seal'd up and fables crost; That wee had left us, nor by time, nor place, Least mention of a Nymph, a Muse, a Grace, But even their names were to bee made a-new, Who could not but create them all, from you? He, that but saw you weare the wheaten hat, Would call you more than Ceres, if not that: And, drest in shepherds tyre, who would not say: You were the bright Oenone, Flora, or May? If dancing, all would cry th' Idalian Queene Were leading forth the Graces on the greene: And, armed to the chase, so bare her bow Diana alone, so hit, and hunted so. There's none so dull, that for your stile would aske, That saw you put on Pallas plumed caske: Or, keeping your due state, that would not cry, There Juno sate, and yet no Peacock by. So are you Natures Index, and restore, I'your selfe, all treasure lost of th'age before. CVI. TO Sir Edward Herbert. If men get name, for some one vertue: Then, What man art thou, that art so many men, All-vertuous Herbert! on whose every part Truth might spend all her voice, Fame all her art. Whether thy learning they would take, or wit, Or valour, or thy judgement seasoning it, Thy standing upright to thy selfe, thy ends Like straight, thy pietie to God, and friends: Their latter praise would still the greatest bee, And yet, they, all together, lesse than thee. CVII. To Captaine Hungry. Doe what you come for, Captaine, with your newes; That's, sit, and eat: doe not my eares abuse. I oft looke on false coine, to know't from true: Not that I love it, more; than I will you. Tell the grosse Dutch those grosser tales of yours, How great you were with their two Emperours; And yet are with their Princes: Fill them full Of your Moravian Horse, Venetian Bull. Tell them, what parts yo'have tane, whence run away, What States yo'have gull'd, and which yet keeps yo'in pay. Give them your Services, and; Embassies In Ireland, Holland, Sweden; pompous lies In Hungary, and Poland, Turkie too; What at Ligorne, Rome, Florence you did doe: And, in some yeare, all these together heap'd, For which there must more sea, and land be leap'd, If but to be beleev'd you have the hap, Than can a flea at twice skip i'the Map. Give your young States-men, (that first make you drunk, And then lye with you, closer, than a punque, For newes) your Ville-royes, and Silleries, Ianin's, your Nuncio's, and your Tuilleries, Your Arch-Dukes Agents, and your Beringhams, That are your words of credit. Keepe your Names Of Hannow, Shieter-huissen, Popenheim, Hans-spiegle, Rotteinberg, and Boutersheim, For your next meale; this you are sure of. Why Will you part with them, here, unthriftily? Nay, now you puffe, tuske, and draw up your chin, Twirle the poore chaine you run a feasting in. Come, be not angrie, you are Hungry; eat; Doe what you come for, Captaine, There's your meat. CVIII. To True Souldiers. Strength of my Countrey, whilst I bring to view Such as are misse-call'd Captaines, and wrong you; And your high names: I doe desire, that thence Be nor put on you, nor you take offence. I sweare by your true friend, my Muse, I love Your great profession; which I once, did prove: And did not shame it with my actions, then, No more, than I dare now doe, with my pen. Hee that not trusts mee, having vow'd thus much, But's angry for the Captaine, still: is such. CIX. To Sir Henry Nevil. Who now calls on thee, Nevil, is a Muse, That serves nor fame, nor titles; but doth chuse Where vertue makes them both, and that's in thee: Where all is faire, beside thy pedigree. Thou art not one, seek'st miseries with hope, Wrestlest with dignities, or fain'st a scope Of service to the publique, when the end Is private gaine, which hath long guilt to friend. Thou rather striv'st the matter to possesse, And elements of honour, than the dresse; To make thy lent life, good against the Fates: And first to know thine owne state, then the States. To be the same in root, thou art in height; And that thy soule should give thy flesh her weight. Goe on, and doubt not, what posteritie, Now I have sung thee thus, shall judge of thee. Thy deeds, unto thy name, will prove new wombes, Whil'st others toyle for titles to their tombes. CX. To Clement Edmonds, On His CÃ¦sars Commentaries observed, and translated. Not CÃ¦sars deeds, not all his honours wonne, In these west-parts, nor when that warre was done, The name of Pompey for an enemie, Cato's to boot, Rome, and her libertie, All yeelding to his fortune, nor, the while, To have engrav'd these Acts, with his owne stile, And that so strong and deepe, as't might be thought, He wrote, with the same spirit that he fought, Nor that his work liv'd in the hands of foes, Un-argued then, and yet hath fame from those; Not all these, Edmonds, or what else put too, Can so speake CÃ¦sar, as thy labours doe. For, where his person liv'd scarce one just age, And that, midst envie, and parts; then fell by rage: His deeds too dying, but in bookes (whose good How few have read! how fewer understood?) Thy learned hand, and true Promethean art, (As by a new creation) part by part, In every counsell, stratageme, designe, Action, or engine, worth a note of thine, T'all future time, not only doth restore His life, but makes, that he can dye no more. CXI. To The Same; On The Same [Clement Edmonds, on his CÃ¦sars Commentaries observed, and translated]. Who Edmonds, reades thy book, and doth not see What th'antique souldiers were, the moderne bee? Wherein thou shew'st, how much the latter are Beholding to this master of the war; And that, in action, there is nothing new, More, than to vary what our elders knew: Which all, but ignorant Captaines, will confesse: Nor to give CÃ¦sar this, makes ours the lesse. Yet thou, perhaps, shalt meet some tongues will grutch, That to the world thou should'st reveale so much, And thence, deprave thee, and thy work. To those CÃ¦sar stands up, as from his urne late rose, By thy great helpe: and doth proclaime by mee, They murder him again, that envy thee. CXII. To A Weake Gamster In Poetry. VVith thy small stock, why art thou ventring still. At this so subtile sport: and play'st so ill? Think'st thou it is meere fortune, that can win? Or thy rank setting? that thou dar'st put in Thy all, at all: and what so ere I do, Art still at that, and think'st to blow me up too? I cannot for the stage a Drama lay, Tragick, or Comick; but thou writ'st the play. I leave thee there, and giving way, entend An Epick Poeme; thou hast the same end. I modestly quit that, and think to writ, Next morne, an Ode: Thou mak'st a song ere night. I passe to Elegies; Thou meet'st me there: To Satyres; and thou dost pursue me. Where, Where shall I scape thee? in an Epigramme? O, (thou cry'st out) that is thy proper game. Troth, if it be, I pitty thy ill lucke; That both for wit, and sense, so oft dost plucke, And never art encounter'd, I confesse: Nor scarce dost colour for it, which is lesse. Pr'y thee, yet save thy rest; give ore in time: There's no vexation, that can make thee prime. CXIII. To Sir Thomas Overbury. So PhÅbus make me worthy of his bayes, As but to speake thee, Overbury, is praise: So, where thou liv'st, thou mak'st life understood! Where, what makes others great, doth keep thee good! I think, the Fate of Court thy comming crav'd, That the wit there, and manners might be sav'd: For since, what ignorance, what pride is fled! And letters, and humanity in the stead! Repent thee not of thy faire precedent, Could make such men, and such a place repent: Nor may' any feare, to lose of their degree, Who'in such ambition can but follow thee. CXIV. To M??. Philip Sydney. I Must beleeve some miracles still bee, When Sydnyes name I heare, or face I see: For Cupid, who (at first) took vaine delight, In meere out-formes, untill he lost his sight, Hath chang'd his soule, and made his object you: Where finding so much beauty met with vertue, He hath not only gain'd himselfe his eyes, But, in your love, made all his servants wise. CXV. On The Townes Honest Man. You wonder, who this is! and, why I name Him not, aloud, that boasts so good a fame: Naming so many, too! But, this is one, Suffers no name, but a description: Being no vitious person, but the vice About the town; and known too, at that price. A subtle thing, that doth affections win By speaking well o'the company 'it's in. Talkes loud, and baudy, has a gather'd deale Of news, and noyse, to sow out a long meale. Can come from Tripoly, leape stooles, and wink, Do all, that 'longs to the anarchy of drink, Except the Duell. Can sing songs, and catches; Give every one his dose of mirth: and watches Whose name's un-welcome to the present eare, And him it layes on; if he be not there. Tel's of him, all the tales, it selfe then makes; But, if it shall be question'd, under-takes, It will deny all; and forsweare it too: Not that it feares, but will not have to do With such a one. And therein keeps it's word. 'Twill see it's sister naked, ere a sword. At every meale, where it doth dine, or sup, The cloth's no sooner gone, but it gets up And shifting of it's faces, doth play more Parts than th' Italian could do, with his dore. Acts old Iniquity, and in the fit Of miming, gets th'opinion of a wit. Executes men in picture. By defect, From friendship, is its own fames architect. An inginer, in slanders, of all fashions, That seeming prayses, are yet accusations. Describ'd it's thus: Defin'd would you it have? Then, The towns honest man's her errant'st knave. CXVI. To Sir William Jephson. Iephson, thou man of men, to whose lov'd name All gentry, yet, owe part of their best flame! So did thy vertue 'enforme, thy wit sustaine That age, when thou stood'st up the master-braine: Thou wert the first, mad'st merit know her strength, And those that lack'd it, to suspect at length, 'Twas not entayl'd on title. That some word Might be found out as good, and not my Lord. That Nature no such difference had imprest In men, but every bravest was the best: That blood not minds, but minds did blood adorne: And to live great, was better, than great borne. These were thy knowing arts: which who doth now Vertuously practise, must at least allow Them in, if not, from thee; or must commit A desperate solÅcisme in truth and wit. CXVII. On Groyne. Groyne, come of age, his state sold out of hand For 'his whore: Groyne doth still occupy his land. CXVIII. On Gut. Gut eates all day, and lechers all the night, So all his meat he tasteth over, twice: And, striving so to double his delight, He makes himselfe a thorough-fare of vice. Thus, in his belly, can he change a sin, Lust it comes out, that gluttony went in. CXIX. To Sir Raph Shelton. Not he that flies the Court for want of cloths, At hunting railes, having no gift in othes, Cries out'gainst, cocking since he cannot bet, Shuns prease, for two maine causes, poxe, and debt, With me can merit more, than that good man, Whose dice not doing well, to 'a pulpit ran. No, Shelton, give me thee, canst want all these, But dost it out of judgement, not disease; Dar'st breath in any ayre; and with safe skill, Till thou canst find the best, choose the least ill. That to the vulgar canst thy selfe apply, Treading a better path, not contrary; And, in their errors maze, thine own way know: Which is to live to conscience, not to show. He, that, but living halfe his age, dyes such; Makes the whole longer, than 'twas given him, much. CXX. An Epitaph On S.P. A Child Of Q. El. Chappel. VVeep with me all you that read This little story: And know, for whom a teare you shed, Death's selfe is sorry. 'Twas a child, that so did thrive In grace, and feature, As Heaven and Nature seem'd to strive Which own'd the creature. Yeares he numbred scarce thirteene When Fates turn'd cruell, Yet three fill'd Zodiackes had he been The Stages jewell; And did act (what now we moane) Old men so duely, As, sooth, the ParcÃ¦ thought him one, He plaid so truely. So, by error to his fate They all consented; But viewing him since (alas, too late) They have repented; And have sought (to give new birth) In bathes to steep him; But, being so much too good for earth, Heaven vowes to keep him. CXXI. To Benjamin Rudyerd. Rudyerd, as lesser dames to great ones use, My lighter comes, to kisse thy learned Muse; Whose beter studies while she emulates, She learnes to know long difference of their states. Yet is the office not to be despis'd, If only love should make the action pris'd: Nor he, for friendship, to be thought unfit, That strives, his manners should procede his wit. CXXII. To The Same. If I would wish, for truth, and not for show, The aged Saturne's age, and rites to know; If I would strive to bring back times, and try The World's pure gold, and wise simplicity; If I would vertue set, as she was yong, And heare her speak with one, &amp; her first tongue; If holiest friend-ship, naked to the touch, I would restore, and keep it ever such; I need no other arts, but study thee: Who prov'st, all these were, and again may bee. CXXIII. To The Same. Writing thy selfe, or judging others writ, I know not which th'hast most, candor, or wit: But both th'hast so, as who affects the state Of the best Writer, and Judge, should emulate. CXXIV. Epitaph On Elizabeth, L.H. VVould'st thou heare, what man can say In a little? Reader, stay. Under-neath this stone doth lye As much beauty, as could dye: Which in life did harbour give To more vertue, than doth live. If, at all, she had a fault, Leave it buried in this vault. One name was Elizabeth, Th'other let it sleep with death: Fitter, where it dyed, to tell, Than that it liv'd at all. Farewell. CXXV. To Sir William Uvedale. Uv'dale, thou piece of the first times, a man Made for what Nature could, or Vertue can; Both whose dimensions, lost, the World might find Restored in thy body, and thy mind! Who sees a soule, in such a body set, Might love the treasure for the cabinet. But I, no child, no foole, respect the kinde, The full, the flowing graces there enshrin'd) Which (would the world not mis-call't, flattery) I could adore, almost t' idolatry. CXXVI. To His Lady, Then M??. Cary. Retyr'd, with purpose your faire worth to praise, 'Mongst Hampton shades, and PhÅbus grove of bayes, I pluck'd a branch; the jealous god did frowne, And bade me lay th'usurped laurell down: Said I wrong'd him, and (which was more) his Love. I answer'd, Daphne now no paine can prove. PhÅbus replyed. Bold head, it is not shee: Cary my love is, Daphne but my tree. CXXVII. To Esme, Lord Aubigny. Is there a hope, that Man would thankfull bee, If I should faile, in gratitude, to thee To whom I am so bound, lov'd Aubigny? No, I do, therefore, call Posterity Into the debt; and reckon on her head, How full of want, how swallow'd up, how dead I, and this Muse had been, if thou hadst not Lent timely succours, and new life begot: So, all reward, or name, that growes to mee By her attempt, shall still be owing thee. And, than this same, I know no abler way To thank thy benefits: which is, to pay. CXXVIII. To William Roe. Roe (and my joy to name) th'art now, to go Countries, and climes, manners, and men to know, T'extract, and choose the best of all these knowne, And those to turne to blood, and make thine owne. May winds as soft as breath of kissing friends, Attend thee hence; and there, may all thy ends, As the beginnings here, prove purely sweet, And perfect in a circle always meet. So, when we, blest with thy returne, shall see Thy selfe, with thy first thoughts, brought home by thee, We each to other may this voyce enspire; This is that good Ãneas, past through fire, Through seas, stormes, tempests: and imbarqu'd for hell, Came back untouch'd. This man hath travail'd well. CXXIX. To Edward Filmer, on his Musicall Work dedicated to the Queen. Anno 1629. VVhat charming Peales are these, That, while they bind the senses, doe so please? They are the Marriage-rites Of two, the choicest Paire of mans delights, Musique and Poesie: French Aire, and English Verse, here wedded lie. Who did this Knot compose, Againe hath brought the Lilly to the Rose; And, with their chained dance, Recelebrates the joyfull Match with France. They are a School to win The faire French: Daughter to learne English in; And, graced with her Song, To make the Language sweet upon her tongue. CXXX. To Mime. That, not a paire of friends each other see, But the first question is, when one saw thee? That there's no journey set, or thought upon, To Braynford, Hackney, Bow, but thou mak'st one; That scarce the Towne designeth any feast To which thou'rt not a weeke, bespoke a guest; That still th'art made the suppers flagge, the drum, The very call, to make all others come: Think'st thou, Mime, this is great? or, that they strive Whose noise shall keepe thy miming most alive, Whil'st thou dost raise some Player, from the grave, Out-dance the Babion, or out-boast the Brave: Or (mounted on a stoole) thy face doth hit On some new gesture, that's imputed wit? O, runne not proud of this. Yet, take thy due. Thou dost out-zany Cokely, Pod; nay, Gue: And thine owne Coriat too. But (would'st thou see) Men love thee not for this: They laugh at thee. CXXXI. To Alphonso Ferrabosco, on his Booke. To urge, my lov'd Alphonso, that bold fame, Of building Towns, and making wild beasts tame, Which Musick had; or speak her knowne effects, That shee removeth cares, sadnesse ejects, Declineth anger, perswades clemencie, Doth sweeten mirth, and heighten pietie, And is t'a body, often, ill inclin'd, No lesse a sov'raigne cure, than to the mind; T'alledge, that greatest men were not asham'd, Of old, even by her practise to be fam'd; To say, indeed, shee were the soule of heaven, That the eight spheare, no lesse, than planets seven, Mov'd by her order, and the ninth more high, Including all, were thence call'd harmonie: I, yet, had utter'd nothing on thy part, When these were but the praises of the Art. But when I have said, the proofes of all these bee Shed in thy Songs; 'tis true: but short of thee. CXXXII. To The Same. When we doe give, Alphonso, to the light, A work of ours, we part with our owne right; For, then, all mouths will judge, and their owne way: The Learn'd have no more priviledge, than the Lay. And though we could all men, all censures heare, We ought not give them taste, we had an eare. For, if the hum'rous world will talke at large, They should be fooles, for me, at their owne charge. Say, this, or that man they to thee preferre; Even those for whom they doe this, know they erre: And would (being ask'd the truth) ashamed say, They were not to be nam'd on the same day. Then stand unto thy selfe, nor seeke without For fame, with breath soone kindled, soone blowne out, CXXXIII. To M?. Josuah Sylvester. If to admire were to commend, my praise Might then both thee, thy Work and merit raise: But, as it is (the Child of Ignorance, And utter stranger to all ayre of France) How can I speak of thy great paines, but erre? Since they can only judge, that can conferre. Behold! the reverend shade of Bartas stands Before my thought, and (in thy right) commands That to the world I publish, for him, this; Bartas doth wish thy English now were his. So well in that are his inventions wrought, As his will now be the Translation thought, Thine the Originall; and France shall boast, No more; those mayden glories shee hath lost. CXXXIV. On The Famous Voyage. No more let Greece her bolder fables tell Of Hercules, or Theseus going to Hell, Orpheus, Ulysses: or the Latine Muse, With tales of Troyes just knight, our faiths abuse. We have a Shelton, and a Heyden got, Had power to act, what they to faine had not. All, that they boast of Styx, of Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegeton, our have prov'd in one; The filth, stench, noise: save only what was there Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here. Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none: And in it, two more horride knaves, than Charon. Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs; And for one Cerberus, the whole coast was dogs. Furies there wanted not: each scold was ten. And, for the cryes of Ghosts, women, and men, Laden with plague-sores, and their sinnes, were heard, Lash'd by their consciences, to die affeard. Then let the former age, with this content her, Shee brought the Poets forth, but ours th' adventer. The Voyage It Selfe. I Sing the brave adventure of two wights, And pity 'tis, I cannot call hem Knights: One was; and he, for brawne, and braine, right able To have been stiled of King Arthurs table. The other was a Squire, of faire degree; But, in the action, greater man than hee: Who gave, to take at his returne from Hell, His three for one. Now, lordlings, listen well. It was the day, what time the powerfull Moone Makes the poore Banck-side creature wet it'shoone, In it'owne hall; when these (in worthy scorne Of those, that put out moneyes, on returne From Venice, Paris, or some in-land passage Of six times to and fro, without embassage, Or he that backward went to Berwick, or which Did dance the famous Morrisse, unto Norwich) At Bread-streets Mermaid, having din'd, and merry, Propos'd to goe to Hol'borne in a wherry: A harder taske, than either his to Bristo', Or his to Antwerpe. Therefore, once more, list ho'. A Docke there is, that called is Avernus, Of some Bride-well, and may, in time, concerne us All, that are readers: but, me thinks 'tis od, That all this while I have forgot some god, Or goddesse to invoke, to stuffe my verse; And with both bombard-stile, and phrase, rehearse The many perills of this Port, and how Sans' helpe of Sybil, or a golden bough, Or magick sacrifice, they past along! Alcides, be thou succouring to my song. Thou'hast seene Hell (some say) and know'st all nookes there, Canst tell me best, how every Fury lookes there, And art a god, if Fame thee not abuses, Alwayes at hand, to aid the merry Muses. Great Club-fist, though thy back, and bones be sore, Still, with thy former labours; yet, once more, Act a brave work, call it thy last adventry: But hold my torch, while I describe the entry To this dire passage. Say thou stop thy nose: 'Tis but light paines: Indeed this Dock's no Rose. In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster, Ycleped Mud, which, when their oares did once stirre, Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster Of all your night-tubs, when the carts doe cluster, Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load: Thorow her wombe they make their famous road, Betweene two walls; where, on one side, to scar men, Were seene your ugly Centaures, yee call Car-men, Gorgonian scolds, and Harpyes: on the other Hung stench, diseases, and old filth, their mother, With famine, wants, and sorrowes many a dosen, The least of which was to the plague a cosen. But they unfrighted passe, though many a privie Spake to them louder, than the Oxe in Livie; And many a sinke powr'd out her rage anenst'hem; But still their valour, and their vertue fenc't 'hem, And, on they went, like Castor brave, and Pollux: Plowing the mayne. When, see (the worst of all lucks) They met the second Prodigie, would feare a Man, that had never heard of a ChimÃ¦ra. One said, it was bold Briareus, or the Beadle, (Who hath the hundred hands when he doth meddle) The other thought it Hydra, or the rock Made of the trull, that cut her fathers lock: But, comming neere, they found it but a liter, So huge, it seem'd, they could by no meanes quite her. Back, cry'd their brace of Charons: they cry'd, no, No going back; on still you rogues, and row. How hight the place? a voyce was heard, Cocytus. Row close then slaves. Alas, they will beshite us. No matter, stinkards, row. What croaking sound Is this we heare? of frogs? No, guts wind-bound, Over your heads: Well, row. At this a loud Crack did report it selfe, as if a cloud Had burst with storme, and downe fell, ab excelsis, Poore Mercury, crying out on Paracelsus, And all his followers, that had so abus'd him: And, in so shitten sort, so long had us'd him: For (where he was the god of eloquence, And subtiltie of metalls) they dispense His spirits, now, in pils, and eeke in potions, Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions. But many Moons there shall not wane (quoth he) (In the meane time, let 'hem imprison me) But I will speake (and know I shall be heard) Touching this cause, where they will be affeard To answer me. And sure, it was th'intent Of the grave fart, late let in Parliament, Had it been seconded, and not in fume Vanish'd away: as you must all presume Their Mercury did now. By this, the stemme Of the hulke touch'd, and, as by Polypheme The sly Ulysses stole in a sheeps-skin, The well-greas'd wherry now had got between, And bade her fare-well sough, unto the lurden: Never did bottom more betray her burden; The meat-boat of Beares colledge, Paris-garden, Stunk not so ill; nor, when she kist, Kate Arden. Yet, one day in the yeare, for sweet 'tis voyc't And that is when it is the Lord Majors foist. By this time had they reach'd the Stygian poole By which the Masters sweare, when on the stoole Of worship, they their nodding chinnes do hit. Against their breasts. Here, sev'rall ghosts did flit About the shore, of farts, but late departed, White, black, blew, greene, and in more formes out-started, Than all those Atomi ridiculous, Whereof old Democrite, and Hill Nicholas, One said, the other swore, the World consists. These be the cause of those thick frequent mists Arising in that place, through which, who goes, Must try the' un-used valour of a nose: And that ours did. For, yet, no nare was tainted, Nor thumbe, nor finger to the stop acquainted, But open, and un-arm'd encounter'd all: Whether it languishing stuck upon the wall, Or were precipitated down the jakes, And, after, swom abroad in ample flakes, Or, that it lay, heap'd like an Usurers masse, All was to them the same, they were to passe, And so they did, from Styx, to Acheron: The ever-boyling flood. Whose banks upon Your Fleet-lane Furies; and hot cooks do dwell, That, with still-scalding steems, make the place hell. The sinks ran grease, and haire of meazled hogs, The heads, houghs, entrailes, and the hides of dogs: For, to say truth, what scullion is so nasty, To put the skins, and offall in a pasty? Cats there lay divers had been flead and rosted, And, after mouldy grown, again were tosted, Then selling not, a dish was tane to mince'hem, But still, it seem'd, the ranknesse did convince 'hem. For, here they were thrown in with'the melted pewter, Yet drown'd they not. They had five lives in future. But 'mong'st these Tiberts, who do you think there was? Old Bankes the juggler, our Pythagoras, Grave tutor to the learned horse. Both which, Being, beyond sea, burned for one witch: Their spirits transmigrated to a cat: And, now, above the poole, a face right fat With great gray eyes, are lifted up, and mew'd; Thrice did it spit: thrice div'd. At last, it view'd Our brave Heroes with a milder glare, And in a pittious tune, began. How dare Your dainty nostrils (in so hot a season, When every clerke eats artichoks and peason, Laxative lettuce, and such windy meat) Tempt such a passage? when each privies seat Is fill'd with buttock? And the wals do sweat Urine, and plaisters? when the noise doth beat Upon your eares, of discords so un-sweet? And out-cries of the damned in the Fleet? Cannot the Plague-bill keep you back? nor bels Of loud Sepulchres with their hourely knels, But you will visit grisly Pluto's hall? Behold where Cerberus, rear'd on the wall Of Hol'borne (three sergeants heads) looks ore, And stays but till you come unto the dore! Tempt not his fury, Pluto is away: And Madame CÃ¦sar, great Proserpina, Is now from home. You lose your labours quite, Were you Jove's sons, or had Alcides might. They cry'd out Pusse. He told them he was Banks, That had so often, shew'd 'hem merry pranks. They laugh't, at his laugh-worthy fate. And past The tripple head without a sop. At last, Calling for Radamanthus, that dwelt by, A sope-boyler; and Ãacus him nigh, Who kept an Ale-house; with my little Minos, An ancient pur-blind fletcher, with a high nose; They took 'hem all to witnesse of their action: And so went bravely back, without protraction. In memory of which most liquid deed, The City since hath rais'd a Pyramide. And I could wish for their eternis'd sakes, My Muse had plough'd with his, that sung A-jax. THE FORREST. I. Why I Write Not Of Love. Some act of Love's bound to reherse, I thought to bind him, in my verse: Which when he felt, Away (quoth he) Can Poets hope to fetter me? It is enough, they once did get Mars, and my Mother, in their net: I weare not these my wings in vaine. With which he fled me: and againe, Into my rimes could ne're be got By any art. Then wonder not, That since, my numbers are so cold, When Love is fled, and I grow old. II. To Penshurst. Thou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show, Of touch, or marble; nor canst boast a row Of polish'd pillars, or a roofe of gold: Thou hast no lantherne, whereof tales are told; Or stayre, or courts; but stand'st an ancient pile, And these grudg'd at, art reverenc'd the while. Thou joy'st in better marks, of soile, of ayre, Of wood, of water: therein thou art faire. Thou hast thy walkes for health, as well as sport: Thy Mount, to which the Dryads do resort, Where Pan, and Bacchus their high feasts have made, Beneath the broad beech, and the chest-nut shade; That taller tree, which of a nut was set, At his great birth, where all the Muses met. There, in the writhed barke, are cut the names Of many a Sylvane, taken with his flames And thence the ruddy Satyres oft provoke The lighter Faunes, to reach thy Ladies oke. Thy copp's, too, nam'd of Gamage, thou hast there, That never failes to serve thee season'd deere, When thou would'st feast, or exercise thy friends. The lower land, that to the river bends, Thy sheep, thy bullocks, kine, and calves do feed: The middle grounds thy Mares, and Horses breed. Each banck, doth yeeld thee Coneyes; and the topps Fertile of wood, Ashore, and Sydney's copp's, To crown thy open table, doth provide The purpled Phesant, with the speckled side: The painted Partrich lyes in every field, And, for thy messe, is willing to be kill'd. And if the high-swolne Medway faile thy dish, Thou hast thy ponds, that pay thee tribute fish, Fat, aged Carps, that run into thy net. And Pikes, now weary their own kinde to eat, As loth, the second draught, or cast to stay, Officiously, at first, themselves betray. Bright Eeles, that emulate them, and leap on land; Before the fisher, or into his hand. Then hath thy Orchard fruit, thy garden flowers, Fresh as the ayre, and new as are the houres. The earely Cherry, with the later Plum, Fig, Grape, and Quince, each in his time doth come: The blushing Apricot, and woolly Peach Hang on thy wals, that every child may reach. And though thy wals be of the countrey stone, They' are rear'd with no mans ruine, no mans grone; There's none, that dwell about them, wish them downe; But all come in, the farmer and the clowne: And no one empty-handed, to salute Thy Lord, and Lady, though they have no sute. Some bring a Capon, some a rurall Cake, Some Nuts, some Apples; some that think they make The better Cheeses, bring 'hem; or else send By their ripe daughters, whom they would commend This way to husbands; and whose baskets beare An Embleme of themselves, in plum, or peare. But what can this (more than expresse their love) Adde to thy free provisions, farre above The need of such? whose liberall boord doth flow, With all, that hospitality doth know! Where comes no guest, but is allow'd to eat, Without his feare, and of thy Lords own meat: Where the same beere, and bread, and selfe-same wine, That is his Lordships, shall be also mine. And I not faine to sit (as some, this day, At great mens tables) and yet dine away. Here no man tels my cups; nor, standing by, A waiter, doth my gluttony envy: But gives me what I call for, and lets me eate; He knowes, below, he shall finde plentie of meate; Thy tables hoord not up for the next day, Nor, when I take my lodging, need I pray For fire, or lights, or livorie: all is there; As if thou, then, wert mines, or I raign'd here: There's nothing I can wish, for which I stay. That found King James, when hunting late, this way, With his brave sonne, the Prince, they saw thy fires Shine bright on every harth as the desires Of thy Penates had beene set on flame, To entertayne them; or the Countrey came, With all their zeale, to warme their welcome here. What (great, I will not say, but) sodaine cheare Didst thou, then, make 'hem! and what praise was heap'd On thy good lady, then! who therein, reap'd The just reward of her high huswifery; To have her linnen, plate, and all things nigh, When she was farre: and not a roome, but drest, As if it had expected such a guest! These, Penshurst, are thy praise, and yet not all. Thy lady's noble, fruitfull, chaste withall. His children thy great lord may call his owne: A fortune, in this age, but rarely knowne. They are, and have been taught religion: Thence Their gentler spirits have suck'd innocence. Each morne, and even, they are taught to pray, With the whole houshold, and may, every day, Reade, in their vertuous parents noble parts, The mysteries of manners, armes, and arts. Now, Penshurst, they that will proportion thee With other edifices, when they see Those proud, ambitious heaps, and nothing else, May say, their lords have built, but thy lord dwells. III. To Sir Robert Wroth. How blest art thou, canst love the countrey, Wroth, Whether by choyce, or fate, or both! And, though so neere the Citie, and the Court, Art tane with neithers vice, nor sport: That at great times, art no ambitious guest Of Sheriffes dinner, or Maiors feast. Nor com'st to view the better cloth of State; The richer hangings, or crowne-plate; Nor throng'st (when masquing is) to have a fight Of the short braverie of the night; To view the jewels, stuffes, the paines, the wit There wasted, some not paid for yet! But canst, at home, in thy securer rest, Live, with un-bought provision blest; Free from proud porches, or their guilded roofes, 'Mongst loughing heards, and solid hoofes: Along'st the curled woods, and painted meades, Through which a serpent river leades To some coole, courteous shade, which he cals his, And makes sleep softer than it is! Or, if thou list the night in watch to breake, A-bed canst heare the loud stag speake, In spring, oft roused for their masters sport, Who, for it, makes thy house his court; Or with thy friends; the heart of all the yeare, Divid'st, upon the lesser Deere; In Autumne, at the Partrich mak'st a flight, And giv'st thy gladder guests the sight; And, in the Winter, hunt'st the flying Hare, More for thy exercise, than fare; While all, that follow, their glad eares apply To the full greatnesse of the cry: Or hauking at the River, or the Bush, Or shooting at the greedy Thrush, Thou dost with some delight the day out-weare, Although the coldest of the yeare! The whil'st the severall seasons thou hast seene Of flowry Fields, of cop'ces greene, The mowed Meddows, with the fleeced Sheep, And feasts, that either shearers keep; The ripened eares, yet humble in their height, And furrows laden with their weight; The apple-harvest, that doth longer last; The hogs return'd home fat from mast; The trees cut out in log; and those boughs made A fire now, that lend a shade! Thus Pan, and Sylvane, having had their rites, Comus puts in, for new delights; And fils thy open hall with mirth, and cheere, As if in Saturnes raigne it were; Apollo's Harpe, and Hermes Lyre resound, Nor are the Muses strangers found: The rout of rurall folk come thronging in, (Their rudenesse then is thought no sin) Thy noblest pouse affords them welcome grace; And the great Heroes, of her race, Sit mixt with losse of State, or reverence. Freedome doth with degree dispence. The jolly wassall walks the often round, And in their cups, their cares are drown'd, They think not, then, which side the cause shall leese, Nor how to get the Lawyer fees. Such, and no other was that age, of old, Which boasts t'have had the head of gold. And such since thou canst make thine own content, Strive, Wroth, to live long innocent. Let others watch in guilty armes, and stand The fury of a rash command, Go enter breaches, meet the cannons rage, That they may sleep with scarres in age. And shew their feathers shot, and Cullours torne, And brag that they were therefore borne. Let this man sweat, and wrangle at the barre, For every price in every jarre, And change possessions, oftner with his breath, Than either money, war, or death: Let him, than hardest sires, more disinherit, And each where boast it as his merit, To blow up Ophanes, Widdows, and their states; And think his power doth equall Fates. Let that go heape a masse of wretched wealth, Purchas'd by rapine, worse than stealth, And brooding o're it sit, with broadest eyes, Not doing good, scarce when he dyes. Let thousands more go flatter vice, and winne, By being organes to great sin, Get place and honor, and be glad to keepe The secrets, that shall breake their sleepe: And, so they ride in Purple, eat in Plate, Though poyson, thinke it a great fate. But thou, my Wroth, if I can truth apply, Shalt neither that, nor this envy: Thy peace is made; and, when mans state is well, 'Tis better, if he there can dwell. God wisheth, none should wracke on a strange shelfe: To him man's dearer, than t'himselfe. And, howsoever we may thinke things sweet, He alwayes gives what he knowes meet; Which who can use is happy: Such be thou. Thy mornings and thy evenings Vow Be thankes to him, and earnest prayer, to finde A body sound, with sounder minde; To do thy Countrey service, thy selfe right; That neither Want doe thee affright, Nor Death; but when thy latest sand is spent, Thou maist thinke life, a thing but lent. IV. To The World. A farewell for a Gentlewoman, vertuous and noble. False world, good-night, since thou hast brought That houre upon my morne of age, Hence-forth I quit thee from my thought, My part is ended on thy stage. Doe not once hope, that thou canst tempt A spirit so resolv'd to tread Upon thy throat, and live exempt From all the nets that thou canst spread. I know thy formes are studied arts, Thy subtill wayes, be narrow straits; Thy curtesie but sudden starts, And what thou call'st thy gifts are baits. I know too, though thou strut, and paint, Yet art thou both shrunke up, and old; That onely fooles make thee a saint, And all thy good is to be sold. I know thou whole art but a shop Of toyes, and trifles, traps, and snares, To take the weake, or make them stop: Yet art thou falser than thy wares. And, knowing this should I yet stay, Like such as blow away their lives, And never will redeeme a day, Enamor'd of their golden gyves? Or having scap'd, shall I returne, And thrust my neck into the noose, From whence, so lately, I did burne, With all my powers, my selfe to loose? What bird, or beast is knowne so dull, That fled his cage, or broke his chaine, And tasting aire, and freedome, wull Render his head in there againe? If these, who have but sense, can shun The engines, that have them annoy'd; Little, for mee, had reason done, If I could not thy ginnes avoid. Yes, threaten, doe. Alas I feare As little, as I hope from thee: I know thou canst nor shew, nor beare More hatred, than thou hast to mee. My tender, first, and simple yeares Thou did'st abuse, and then betray; Since stird'st up jealousies and feares, When all the causes were away. Then, in a soile hast planted me, Where breathe the basest of thy fooles; Where envious arts professed be, And pride, and ignorance the schooles, Where nothing is examin'd, weigh'd, But, as 'tis rumor'd, so beleev'd: Where every freedome is betray'd, And every goodnesse tax'd, or griev'd. But, what we'are borne for, wee must beare: Our fraile condition it is such, That, what to all may happen here, If't chance to mee, I must not grutch. Else, I my state should much mistake, To harbour a divided thought From all my kinde: that, for my sake, There should a miracle be wrought. No, I doe know, that I was borne To age, misfortune, sicknesse, griefe: But I will beare these, with that scorne, As shall not need thy false reliefe. Nor for my peace will I goe farre, As wandrers doe, that still doe rome; But make my strengths, such as they are, Here in my bosome, and at home. V. Song. To Celia. Come my Celia, let us prove, While wee may, the sports of love; Time will not be ours, for'ever: He, at length, our good will sever. Spend not then his gifts in vaine. Sunnes, that set, may rise againe: But, if once wee lose this light, 'Tis, with us, perpetuall night. Why should we deferre our joyes? Fame, and rumor are but toyes. Cannot wee delude the eyes Of a few poore houshold spyes? Or his easier eares beguile, So removed by our wile? 'Tis no sinne, loves fruit to steale, But the sweet theft to reveale: To bee taken, to be seene, These have crimes accounted beene. VI. To The Same. Kisse mee, Sweet: The wary lover Can your favours keepe, and cover, When the common courting jay All your bounties will betray. Kisse againe: no creature comes. Kisse, and score up wealthy summes On my lips, thus hardly sundred, While you breathe. First give a hundred, Then a thousand, then another Hundred, then unto the tother Adde a thousand, and so more: Till you equall with the store, All the grasse that Rumney yeelds, Or the sands in Chelsey fields, Or the drops in silver Thames, Or the stars, that guild his streames, In the silent sommer-nights, When youths ply their stoln delights. That the curious may not know How to tell 'hem as they flow, And the envious, when they find What their number is, be pin'd. VII. Song. That Women Are But Mens Shaddows. Follow a shaddow, it still flies you, Seeme to flye it, it will pursue: So court a mistris, she denies you; Let her alone, she will court you. Say, are not women truly, then, Stil'd but the shaddows of us men? At morne, and even, shades are longest; At noone, they are short, or none: So men at weakest, they are strongest, But grant us perfect, they're not knowne. Say, are not women truly, then, Stil'd but the shaddows of us men? VIII. Song. To Sicknesse. Why, Disease, dost thou molest Ladies? and of them the best? Do not men, ynow of rites To thy altars, by their nights Spent in surfets: and their dayes, And nights too, in worser wayes? Take heed, Sicknesse, what you do, I shall feare, you'll surfet too. Live not we, as, all thy stals, Spittles, pest-house, hospitals, Scarce will take our present store? And this age will build no more: 'Pray thee, feed contented, then, Sicknesse; only on us men. Or if needs thy lust will taste Woman-kind; devoure the waste Livers, round about the town. But forgive me, with thy crown They maintaine the truest trade, And have more diseases made. What should, yet, thy pallat please? Daintinesse, and softer ease, Sleeked lims, and finest blood? If thy leannesse love such food, There are those, that, for thy sake, Do enough; and who would take Any paines; yea, think it price, To become thy sacrifice. That distill their husbands land In decoctions; and are mann'd With ten Emp'ricks, in their chamber, Lying for the spirit of amber. That for the oyle of Talck, dare spend More than citizens dare lend Them, and all their officers. That to make all pleasure theirs, Will by coach, and water go, Every stew in towne to know; Date entayle their loves on any, Bald, or blind, or nere so many: And, for thee at common game, Play away, health, wealth, and fame. These, disease, will thee deserve: And will, long ere thou should'st starve, On their bed most prostitute, Move it, as their humblest sute, In thy justice to molest None but them, and leave the rest. IX. Song. To Celia. Drink to me, only, with thine eyes, And I will pledge with mine; Or leave a kisse but in the cup, And Ile not look for wine. The thirst, that from the soule doth rise, Doth aske a drink divine: But might I of Jove's Nectar sup, I would not change for thine. I sent thee, late, a rosie wreath, Not so much honoring thee, As giving it a hope, that there It could not withered be. But thou thereon did'st onely breathe, And sent'st it back to mee: Since when it growes, and smells, I sweare, Not of it selfe, but thee. X. [And must I sing? what subject shall I chuse?] And must I sing? what subject shall I chuse? Or whose great name in Poets heaven use? For the more countenance to my active Muse? Hercules? alas his bones are yet sore, With his old earthly labours. T'exact more, Of his dull god-head, were sinne. Ile implore PhÅbus? No. tend thy cart still. Envious day Shall not give out, that I have made thee stay, And foundred thy hot teame, to tune my lay. Nor will I begge of thee, Lord of the vine, To raise my spirits with thy conjuring wine, In the greene circle of thy Ivie twine. Pallas, nor thee I call on, mankind maid, That, at thy birth, mad'st the poore Smith affraid, Who, with his axe, thy fathers mid-wife plaid. Goe, crampe dull Mars, light Venus, when he snorts, Or, with thy Tribade trine, invent new sports. Thou, nor thy loosenesse with my making sorts. Let the old Boy, your sonne, ply his old taske, Turne the stale prologue to some painted maske, His absence in my verse, is all I aske. Hermes, the cheater, shall not mix with us, Though hee would steale his sisters Pegasus, And riffle him: or pawne his Petasus. Nor all the ladies of the Thespian lake, (Though they were crusht into one forme) could make A beautie of that merit, that should take My Muse up by commission: No, I bring My owne true fire. Now my thought takes wing, And now an Epode to deepe eares I sing. XI. Epode. [Not to know vice at all, and keepe true state] Not to know vice at all, and keepe true state, Is vertue, and not Fate: Next, to that vertue, is to know vice well, And her black spight expell. Which to effect (since no brest is so sure, Or safe, but shee'll procure Some way of entrance) we must plant a guard Of thoughts to watch, and ward At th'eye and eare (the ports unto the minde) That no strange, or unkinde Object arrive there, but the heart (our spie) Give knowledge instantly, To wakefull Reason, our affections king: Who (in th'examining) Will quickly taste the reason, and commit Close, the close cause of it. 'Tis the securest policie we have, To make our sense our slave. But this true course is not embrac'd by many: By many? scarce by any. For either our affections doe rebell, Or else the sentinell (That should ring larum to the heart) doth sleepe, Or some great thought doth keepe Back the intelligence, and falsely sweares, Th'are base, and idle feares Whereof the loyall conscience so complaines. Thus by these subtill traines, Doe severall passions invade the minde, And strike our reason blinde. Of which usurping ranck, some have thought Love The first; as prone to move Most frequent tumults, horrors, and unrests, In our enflamed brests: But this doth from the cloud of error grow, Which thus we over-blow. The thing, they here call Love, is blinde Desire, Arm'd with bow, shafts, and fire; Inconstant, like the sea, of whence 'tis borne, Rough, swelling, like a storme: With whom who sailes, rides on the surge of feare, And boyles, as if he were In a continuall tempest. Now, true Love No such effects doth prove; That is an essence farre more gentle, fine, Pure, perfect, nay divine; It is a golden chaine let downe from heaven, Whose linkes are bright, and even. That falls like sleepe on Lovers, and combines The soft, and sweetest mindes In equall knots: This beares no brands, nor darts, To murther different hearts, But, in a calme, and god-like unitie, Preserves communitie. O, who is he, that (in this peace) enjoyes Th'Elixir of all joyes? A forme more fresh, than are the Eden bowers, And lasting, as her flowers: Richer than Time, and as Time's vertue, rare: Sober, as saddest care: A fixed thought, an eye un-taught to glance; Who (blest with such high chance) Would, at suggestion of a steep desire, Cast himselfe from the spire Of all his happinesse? But soft: I heare Some vicious foole draw neare, That cryes, we dream, and swears there's no such thing, As this chaste love we sing. Peace luxury, thou art like one of those Who, being at sea, suppose, Because they move, the Continent doth so. No, vice, we let thee know, Though thy wild thoughts with sparrows wings do flye, Turtles can chastly dye; And yet (in this t'expresse our selves more cleare) We do not number here, Such Spirits as are only continent, Because lust's meanes are spent: Or those, who doubt the common mouth of fame, And for their place and name, Cannot so safely sinne. Their chastity Is meere necessity. Nor meane we those, whom Vowes and conscience Have fill'd with abstinence: Though we acknowledge, who can so abstayne, Makes a most blessed gaine. He that for love of goodnesse hateth ill, Is more crowne-worthy still, Than he, which for sins penalty forbeares; His heart sins, though he feares. But we propose a person like our Dove, Grac'd with a PhÅnix love; A beauty of that cleare, and sparkling light, Would make a day of night, And turne the blackest sorrowes to bright joyes: Whose od'rous breath destroyes All taste of bitternesse, and makes the ayre As sweet as she is faire. A body so harmoniously compos'd, As if Nature disclos'd All her best symmetrie in that one feature! O, so divine a creature, Who could be false to? chiefly when he knowes How only she bestowes The wealthy treasure of her love on him; Making his fortunes swim In the full flood of her admir'd perfection? What savage, brute affection, Would not be fearefull to offend a dame Of this excelling frame? Much more a noble, and right generous mind (To vertuous moods inclin'd) That knowes the weight of guilt: He will refraine From thoughts of such a straine. And to his sense object this sentence ever, Man may securely sinne, but safely never. XII. Epistle To Elizabeth Countesse Of Rutland. Madame, VVhil'st that, for which all vertue now is sold, And almost every vice, almightie gold, That which, to boote with hell, is thought worth heaven, And for it, life, conscience, yea soules are given, Toyles, by grave custome, up and downe the Court, To every squire, or groome, that will report Well, or ill, only, all the following yeere, Just to the waight their this dayes-presents beare; While it makes huishers serviceable men, And some one apteth to be trusted, then, Though never after; whiles it gaynes the voyce Of some grand peere, whose ayre-doth make rejoyce The foole that gave it; who will want, and weepe, When his proud patrons favours are asleepe; While thus it buyes great grace, and hunts poore fame; Runs betweene man, and man, 'tweene, dame, and dame; Solders crackt friendship; makes love last a day; Or perhaps lesse: whil'st gold beares all this sway, I, that have none (to send you) send you verse. A present which (if elder Writs reherse The truth of times) was once of more esteeme, Than this, our guilt, nor golden age can deeme, When gold was made no weapon to cut throats, Or put to flight Astrea, when her ingots Were yet unfound, and better plac'd in earth, Than, here, to give pride fame, and peasants birth. But let this drosse carry: what price it will With noble ignorants, and let them still, Turne, upon scorned verse, their quarter-face: With you, I know, my offring will finde grace. For what a sinne 'gainst your great fathers spirit, Were it to think, that you should not inherit His love unto the Muses, when his skill Almost you have, or may have, when you will? Wherein wise Nature you a dowrie gave, Worth an estate, treble to that you have. Beauty, I know, is good, and blood is more; Riches thought most: But, Madame, think what store The world hath seene, which all these had in trust, And now lye lost in their forgotten dust. It is the Muse alone, can raise to heaven, And, at her strong armes end, hold up, and even, The soules, she loves. Those other glorious notes, Inscrib'd in touch or marble, or the cotes Painted, or carv'd upon our great-mens tombs, Or in their windowes; doe but prove the wombs, That bred them, graves: when they were borne, they dy'd, That had no Muse to make their fame abide. How many equall with the Argive Queene, Have beauty knowne, yet none so famous seene? Achilles was not first, that valiant was, Or, in an armies head, that lockt in brasse, Gave killing strokes. There were brave men, before Ajax, or Idomen, or all the store, That Homer brought to Troy; yet none so live: Because they lack'd the sacred pen, could give Like life unto 'hem. Who heav'd Hercules Unto the starrs? or the Tyndarides? Who placed Jasons Argo in the skie? Or set bright Ariadnes crowne so high? Who made a lampe of Berenices hayre? Or lifted Cassiopea in her chayre? But only Poets, rapt with rage divine? And such, or my hopes faile, shall make you shine. You, and that other starre; that purest light, Of all Lucina's traine; Lucy the bright. Than which, a nobler heaven it selfe knowes not. Who, though shee have a better Verser got, (Or Poet, in the Court account) than I, And, who doth me (though I not him) envy, Yet for the timely favours shee hath done, To my lesse sanguine Muse, wherein she hath wonne My gratefull soule, the subject of her powers, I have already us'd some happy houres, To her remembrance; which when time shall bring To curious light, to notes, I then shall sing, Will prove old Orpheus Act no rule to be: For I shall move stocks, stones, no lesse than he. Then all, that have but done my Muse least grace, Shall thronging come, and boast the happy place They hold in my strange poems, which, as yet, Had not their forme touch'd by an English wit. There like a rich, and golden Pyramede, Borne up by statues, shall I reare your head, Above your under-carved ornaments, And show, how, to the life, my soule presents Your forme imprest there: not with tickling rimes, Or Common-places, filch'd, that take these times, But high, and noble matter; such as flies From braines entranc'd, and fill'd with extasies; Moods, which the god-like Sydney oft did prove, And your brave friend, and mine so well did love. Who, wheresoere he be ? The rest is lost. XIII. Epistle. To Katherine, Lady Aubigny: 'Tis growne almost a danger to speake true Of any good minde, now: There are so few. The bad, by number, are so fortified, As what th'have lost t'expect, they dare deride. So both the prais'd, and praisers suffer: Yet, For others ill, ought none their good forget. I, therefore, who professe my selfe in love With every vertue, wheresoere it move, And howsoever; as I am at fewd With sinne and vice, though with a throne endew'd; And, in this name, am given out dangerous By arts, and practise of the vicious, Such as suspect themselves, and think it fit For their owne cap'tall crimes, t'indite my wit; I, that have suffer'd this; and, though forsooke Of Fortune, have not alter'd yet my looke, Or so my selfe abandon'd, as because Men are not just, or keepe no holy lawes Of nature, and societie, I should faint; Or feare to draw true lines, 'cause others paint: I, Madame, am become your praiser. Where, If it may stand with your soft blush to heare, Your selfe but told unto your selfe, and see In my character, what your features bee, You will not from the paper slightly passe: No Lady, but, at sometime loves her glasse. And this shall be no false one, but as much Remov'd, as you from need to have it such. Looke then, and see your selfe. I will not say Your beautie; for you see that every day: And so doe many more. All which can call It perfect, proper, pure, and naturall, Not taken up o' th'Doctors, but as well As I, can say, and see it doth excell. That askes but to be censur'd by the eyes: And, in those outward formes, all fooles are wise. Nor that your beautie wanted not a dower, Doe I reflect. Some Alderman has power, Or cos'ning Farmer of the customes so, T'advance his doubtfull issue, and ore-flow A Princes fortune: These are gifts of chance, And raise not vertue; they may vice enhance. My mirror is more subtill, cleare, refin'd, And takes, and gives the beauties of the mind. Though it reject not those of Fortune: such As Blood, and Match. Wherein, how more than much Are you engaged to your happie fate, For such a lot! that mixt you with a State Of so great title, birth, but vertue most, Without which, all the rest were sounds, or lost. 'Tis onely that can time, and chance defeat: For he, that once is good, is ever great. Wherewith, then, Madame, can you better pay This blessing of your starres, than by that way Of vertue, which you tread? what if alone? Without companions? 'Tis safe to have none. In single paths, dangers with ease are watch'd: Contagion in the prease is soonest catch'd. This makes, that wisely you decline your life, Farre from the maze of custome, error, strife, And keepe an even, and unalter'd gaite; Not looking by, or back (like those, that waite Times, and occasions, to start forth, and seeme) Which though the turning world may dis-esteeme, Because that studies spectacles, and showes, And after varied, as fresh objects goes, Giddie with change, and therefore cannot see Right, the right way: yet must your comfort bee Your conscience, and not wonder, if none askes For Truths complexion, where they all weare maskes. Let who will follow fashions, and attyres, Maintaine their liedgers forth, for forrain wyres, Melt downe their husbands land, to powre away On the close groome, and page, on new-yeares day, And almost, all dayes after, while they live; (They finde it both so wittie, and safe to give) Let 'hem on poulders, oyles, and paintings, spend, Till that no usurer, nor his bawds dare lend Them, or their officers: and no man know, Whether it be a face they weare, or no. Let 'hem waste body, and state; and after all, When their owne Parasites laugh at their fall, May they have nothing left, whereof they can Boast, but how oft they have gone wrong to man: And call it their brave sinne. For such there be That doe sinne onely for the infamie: And never think, how vice doth every houre, Eat on her clients, and some one devoure. You, Madam, yong have learn'd to shun these shelves, Whereon the most of mankind wracke themselves, And, keeping a just course, have early put Into your harbour, and all passage shut 'Gainst stormes, or pyrats, that might charge your peace; For which you worthy are the glad increase Of your blest wombe, made fruitfull from above To pay your lord the pledges of chaste love: And raise a noble stemme, to give the fame, To Cliftons blood, that is deny'd their name. Grow, grow, faire tree, and as thy branches shoote, Heare, what the Muses sing above thy root, By me, their Priest (if they can ought divine) Before the moones have fill'd their tripple trine, To crowne the burthen which you go withall, It shall a ripe and timely issue fall, T'expect the honors of great 'Avbigny: And greater rites, yet writ in mystery, But which the Fates forbid me to reveale. Only, thus much, out of a ravish'd zeale, Unto your name, and goodnesse of your life, They speake; since you are truly that rare wife, Other great wives may blush at: when they see What your try'd manners are, what theirs should be. How you love one, and him you should; how still You are depending on his word, and will; Not fashion'd for the Court, or strangers eyes; But to prease him, who is the dearer prise Unto himselfe, by being so deare to you. This makes, that your affections still be new, And that your soules conspire, as they were gone Each into other, and had now made one. Live that one, still; and as long yeares do passe, Madame, be bold to use this truest glasse: Wherein, your forme, you still the same shall find; Because nor it can change, nor such a mind. XIIII. Ode. To Sir William Sydney, On His Birth-day. Now that the harth is crown'd with smiling fire, And some do drink, and some do dance, Some ring, Some sing, And all do strive t'advance The gladnesse higher: Wherefore should I Stand silent by. Who not the least, Both love the cause, and authors of the feast. Give me my cup, but from the Thespian Well, That I may tell to Sydney, what This day Doth say, And he may think on that Which I do tell: When all the noyse Of these forc'd joyes, Are fled and gone, And he, with his best Genius left alone. This day says, then, the number of glad yeares Are justly summ'd, that make you man; Your vow Must now Strive all right ways it can, T'out-strip your peeres: Since he doth lack Of going back Little, whose will Doth urge him to run wrong, or to stand still. Nor can a little of the common store, Of nobles vertue, shew in you; Your blood So good And great, must seek for new, And study more: Nor weary, rest On what's deceast. For they, that swell With dust of ancestors, in graves but dwell. 'Twill be exacted of your name, whose sonne, Whose nephew, whose grand-child you are; And men Will, then, Say you have follow'd farre, When well begun: Which must be now, They teach you, how. And he that stayes To liue untill to morrow 'hath lost two dayes. So may you live in honor, as in name, If with this truth you be inspir'd; So may This day Be more, and long desir'd: And with the flame Of love bee bright, As with the light Of bone-fires. Then The Birth-day shines, when logs not burne, but men. XV. To Heaven. Good, and great God, can I not think of thee, But it must, straight, my melancholy bee? Is it interpreted in mee disease, That, laden with my sinnes. I seeke for ease? O, be thou witnesse, that the reines dost know, And hearts of all, if I be sad for show, And judge mee after: if I dare pretend To ought but grace, or ayme at other end. As thou art all, so be thou all to mee, First, midst, and last, converted one, and three; My faith, my hope, my love: and in this state, My judge, my witnesse, and my advocate. Where have I been this while exil'd from thee? And whither rapt, now thou but stoup'st to mee? Dwell, dwell here still: O, being every-where, How can I doubt to finde thee ever, here? I know my state, both full of shame, and scorne, Conceiv'd in sinne, and unto labour borne, Standing with feare, and must with horror fall, And destin'd unto judgement, after all. I feele my griefes too, and there scarce is ground, Upon my flesh t'inflict another wound. Yet dare I not complaine, or wish for death With holy Paul, lest it be thought the breath Of Discontent; or that these prayers bee For wearinesse of life, not love of thee. THE END.

A PANEGYRE, ON THE HAPPY ENTRANCE OF Iames, our Soveraigne, to His first high Session of Parliament in this his Kingdome, the 19 of March, 1603. Licet toto nunc Helicone frui. Mart. Heav'n now not strives, alone, our breasts to fill With joyes: but urgeth his full favors still. Againe, the glory of our Westerne World Unfolds himselfe: and from his eyes are hoorl'd (To day) a thousand radiant lights, that streame To every nook and angle of his Realme. His former rayes did only cleare the sky; But these his searching beams are cast, to pry Into those dark and deep concealed vaults, Where men commit black incest with their faults; And snore supinely in the stall of sin: Where Murder, Rapine, Lust, do sit within, Carowsing humane blood in yron bowles, And make their den the slaughter-house of soules: From whose foule reeking cavernes first arise Those damps, that so offend all good mens eyes, And would (if not dispers'd) infect the Crown, And in their vapor her bright metall drown. To this so cleare and sanctified an end, I saw, when reverend Themis did descend Upon his State; let down in that rich chaine, That fastneth heavenly power to earthly raigne: Beside her, stoup't on either hand, a maid, Faire Dice, and Eunomia; who were said To be her daughters: and but faintly known On earth, till now, they came to grace his throne. Her third, Irene, help'd to beare his traine; And in her office vow'd she would remaine, Till forraine malice, or unnaturall spight (Which Fates avert) should force her from her right. With these he pass'd, and with his peoples hearts Breath'd in his way; and soules (their better parts) Hasting to follow forth in shouts, and cryes. Upon his face all threw their covetous eyes, As on a wonder: some amazed stood, As if they felt, but had not known their good Others would faine have shew'n it in their words: But, when their speech so poore, a help affords Unto their zeals expression; they are mute: And only with red silence him salute. Some cry from tops of houses; thinking noyse The fittest herald to proclaime true joyes: Others on ground run gazing by his side, All, as unwearied, as unsatisfied: And every windore griev'd it could not move Along with him, and the same trouble prove. They that had seen, but foure short dayes before, His gladding look, now long'd to see it more. And as of late, when he through London went, The amorous City spar'd no ornament, That might her beauties heighten; but so drest, As our ambitious Dames, when they make feast, And would be courted: so this Town put on Her brightest tyre; and, in it, equall shone To her great sister: save that modesty, Her place, and yeares, grave her precedency. The joy of either was alike, and full; No age, nor sexe, so weak, or strongly dull, That did not beare a part in this consent Of hearts, and voyces. All the aire was rent, As with the murmure of a moving wood; The ground beneath did seeme a moving flood: Wals, windores, roofs, towers, steeples, all were set With severall eyes, that in this object met. Old men were glad, their fates till now did last; And infants, that the houres had made such hast To bring them forth: Whil'st riper age'd, and apt To understand the more, the more were rapt. This was the peoples love, with which did strive The Nobles zeale, yet either kept alive The others flame, as doth the wike and waxe, That friendly temper'd, one pure taper makes. Meane while, the reverend Themis draws aside The Kings obeying will, from taking pride In these vaine stirs, and to his mind suggests How he may triumph in his Subjects brests, âWith better pomp. She tels him first, that Kings âAre here on earth the most conspicuous things: âThat they, by Heaven, are plac'd upon his throne, âTo rule like Heaven; and have no more their own, âAs they are men, then men. That all they do âThough hid at home, abroad is search'd into: âAnd being once found out, discover'd lyes âUnto as many envies, there, as eyes. âThat Princes, since they know it is their fate, âOft-times, to have the secrets of their State âBetraid to fame, should take more care, and feare âIn publique acts what face and forme they beare. âShe then remembred to his thought the place âWhere he was going; and the upward race âOf Kings, prÃ¦ceding him in that high Court; âTheir laws, their ends; the men she did report: âAnd all so justly, as his eare was joy'd âTo heare the truth, from spight of flattery voyd. âShe shewd him, who made wise, who honest Acts; âWho both, who neither: all the cunning tracts, âAnd thrivings statutes she could promptly note; âThe bloody, base, and barbarous she did quote; âWhere laws were made to serve the tyran' will; âWhere sleeping they could save, and waking kill; âWhere acts gave licence to impetuous lust âTo bury Churches, in forgotten dust, âAnd with their ruines raise the panders bowers: âWhen, publique justice borrow'd all her powers âFrom private chambers; that could then create âLaws, Judges, Consellors, yea Prince, and State. âAll this she told, and more, with bleeding eyes; âFor Right is as compassionate as wise. Nor did he seeme their vices so to love, As once defend, what Themis did reprove. For though by right, and benefit of Times, He ownde their crowns, he would not so their crimes. He knew that Princes, who had sold their fame To their voluptuous lusts, had lost their name; And that no wretch was more unblest than he, Whose necessary good 'twas now to be An evill King: And so must such be still, Who once have got the habit to do ill. One wickednesse another must defend; For vice is safe, while she hath vice to friend. He knew, that those, who would, with love, command, Must with a tender (yet a stedfast) hand Sustaine the reynes, and in the check forbeare To offer cause of injury, or feare. That Kings, by their example, more do sway Than by their power; and men do more obay When they are led, than when they are compell'd. In all these knowing Arts our Prince excell'd. And now the dame had dried her dropping eyne, When, like an April Iris, flew her shine About the streets, as it would force a spring From out the stones, to gratulate the King. She blest the people, that in shoales did swim To heare her speech; which still began in him, And ceas'd in them. She told them, what a fate Was gently falne from Heaven upon this State; How deare a father they did now enjoy That came to save, what discord would destroy: And entring with the power of a King, The temp'rance of a private man did bring, That wan affections, ere his steps wan ground; And was not hot, or covetous to be crown'd Before mens hearts had crown'd him. Who (unlike Those greater bodies of the sky, that strike The lesser fiers dim) in his accesse Brighter than all, hath yet made no one lesse; Though many greater: and the most, the best. Wherein, his choice was happy with the rest Of his great actions, first to see, and do What all mens wishes did aspire unto. Hereat, the people could no longer hold Their bursting joyes; but through the ayre was rol'd The length'ned showt, as when th'artillery Of Heaven is discharg'd along the sky: And this confession flew from every voyce, Never had Land more reason to rejoyce, Nor to her blisse, could ought now added bee, Save, that she might the same perpetuall see. Which when Time, Nature, and the Fates deny'd, With a twice louder shoute again they cry'd, Yet, let blest Brittaine aske (without your wrong) Still to have such a King, and this King long.

From every head, almost, how she is frighted! The very age abhorres her so, That it learnes to speak and goe As if by art alone it could be righted. FINIS.</field>

And though little money, in them you doe beare. It cost more to get, then to lose in a day. You oft haue beene told, Both the young and the old; And bidden beware of the cutpurse so bold: Then if you take heed not, free me from the curse, Who both giue you warning, for and, the cutpurse. Youth, youth, thou hadst better bin staru'd by thy Nurse, Then liue to be hanged for cutting a purse. Nig. It hath bin vpbrayded to men of my trade, That oft? times we are the cause of this crime. Alacke and for pitty, why should it be said? As if they regarded or places, or time. Examples haue been Of some that were seen, In Westminster Hall, yea the pleaders between, Then why should the Iudges be free from this curse, More then my poore selfe, for cutting the purse? Youth, youth, thou hadst better bin staru'd by thy Nurse, Then liue to be hanged for cutting a purse. Nig. At Worc'ter 'tis knowne well, and euen i'the Iayle, A Knight of good worship did there shew his face, Against the foule sinners, in zeale for to rayle, And lost (ipso facto) his purse in the place. Nay, once from the Seat Of Iudgement so great, A Iudge there did lose a faire pouch of veluete. O Lord for thy mercy, how wicked or worse, Are those that so venture their necks for a purse! Youth, youth, &amp;c. Nig. At Playes and at Sermons, and at the Sessions, 'Tis daily their practice such booty to make: Yea, vnder the Gallowes, at Executions, They sticke not the Stare-abouts purses to take. Nay one without grace, at a better place, At Court, &amp; in Christmas, before the Kings face, Alacke then for pitty must I beare the curse, That onely belongs to the cunning cutpurse? Nig. But O, you vile nation of cutpurses all, Relent and repent, and amend and be sound, And know that you ought not, by honest mens fall, Adnauce your owne fortunes, to die aboue ground, And though you goe gay, In silkes as you may, It is not the high way to heauen, (as they say) Repent then, repent you, for better, for worse: And kisse not the Gallowes for cutting a purse. Youth, youth, thou hadst better bin steru'd by thy Nurse, Then liue to be hanged for cutting a purse. [I was not wearier where I lay] [Aurora.] I was not wearier where I lay By frozen Tythons side to night; Then I am willing now to stay, And be a part of your delight.

As Night to sport, Day doth to action call, Which they the rather doe obey, Because the Morne, with Roses strew's the way. [Roome, roome, make roome for the bouncing bellie] Roome, roome, make roome for the bouncing bellie, First father of sauce, and deviser of jellie; Prime master of Arts, and the giver of wit, That found out the excellent Engine, the spit; The plough, and the flaile, the mill, and the hopper, The hutch, and the boulter, the furnace and copper, The oven, the baven, the mawkin, the peele, The harth, and the range, the dogge, and the wheele, He, he first invented the hogshead and tun, The gimlet and vice too, and taught 'em to run, And since with the funnell, and Hippocras bag, H'as made of himselfe, that now he cries swag; Which showes though the pleasure be but of foure inches, Yet he is a Weesell, the gullet that pinches Of any delight, and not spares from this backe, What ever to make of the bellie a sacke! Haile, haile plump paunch, Ã´ the founder of taste, For fresh-meats, or powlder'd, or pickle, or paste, Devourer of broyl'd, back'd, roasted, or sod; And emptier of cups, be they even or odd; All which have now made thee so wide i'the waste, As scarce with no pudding thou art to be lac'd, But eating and drinking untill thou dost nod, Thou break'st all thy girdles, and breakst forth a god. [Come on, come on; and where you go] Come on, come on; and where you go, so interweave the curious knot, As ev'n th'observer scarce may know which lines are Pleasures, and which not: First figure out the doubtfull way, at which a while all youth should stay, Where she and Vertue did contend, which should have Hercules to friend. Then as all actions of mankinde, are but a laborinth, or maze: So let your Dances be entwin'd, yet not perplex men unto gaze; But measur'd, and so numerous too, as men may read each act they doe; And when they see the graces meet, admire the wisedome of your feet: For dancing is an exercise, not onely showes the movers wit, But maketh the beholders wise, as he hath power to rise to it.

Be not frighted with our fashion, Though we seeme a tattered Nation; We account our ragges, our riches, So our tricks exceed our stitches. Give us Bacon, rindes of Walnuts, Shells of Cockels, and of Smalnuts; Ribands, bells, and Safrond lynnen, All the World is ours to winne in. Knackes we have that will delight you, slight of hand that will invite you, To endure our tawny faces. Wo. Quit your places, and not cause you cut your laces.

From a Fiddle out of tune, As the Cuckow is in June.

With the same, leave the Ancients, call'd that kind of body Sylva, or ???, in which there were workes of divers nature, and matter congested; as the multitude call Timber-trees, promiscuously growing, a Wood, or Forrest: so am I bold to entitle these lesser Poems, of later growth, by this of Vnder-wood, out of the Analogie they hold to the Forrest, in my former booke, and no otherwise. Ben. Iohnson. The Sinners Sacrifice. To the Holy Trinitie. 1 O Holy, blessed, glorious Trinitie Of persons, still one God, in Unitie. The faithfull mans beleeved Mysterie, Helpe, helpe to lift 2 My selfe up to thee, harrow'd, torne, and bruis'd By sinne, and Sathan; and my flesh misus'd, As my heart lies in peeces, all confus'd, O take my gift. 3 All-gracious God, the Sinners sacrifice. A broken heart thou wert not wont despise, But 'bove the fat of rammes, or bulls, to prize An offring meet, 4 For thy acceptance. O, behold me right, And take compassion on my grievous plight. What odour can be, then a heart contrite, To thee more sweet? 5 Eternall Father, God, who did'st create This All of nothing, gavest it forme, and fate, And breath'st into it, life, and light, with state To worship thee. 6 Eternall God the Sonne, who not denyd'st To take our nature; becam'st man, and dyd'st, To pay our debts, upon thy Crosse, and cryd'st All's done in me. 7 Eternall Spirit, God from both proceeding, Father and Sonne; the Comforter, in breeding Pure thoughts in man: with fiery zeale them feeding For acts of grace. 8 Increase those acts, Ã´ glorious Trinitie Of persons, still one God in Unitie; Till I attaine the long'd-for mysterie of seeing your face. 9 Beholding one in three, and three in one, A Trinitie, to shine in Unitie; The gladdest light, darke man can thinke upon; O grant it me! 10 Father, and Sonne, and Holy Ghost, you three All coeternall in your Majestie, Distinct in persons, yet in Unitie One God to see. 11 My Maker, Saviour, and my Sanctifier. To heare, to meditate, sweeten my desire, With grace, with love, with cherishing intire, O, then how blest; 12 Among thy Saints elected to abide, And with thy Angels, placed side, by side, But in thy presence, truly glorified Shall I there rest? A Hymne to God the Father. Heare mee, O God! A broken heart, Is my best part: Use still thy rod, That I may prove Therein, thy Love. If thou hadst not Beene sterne to mee, But left me free, I had forgot My selfe and thee. For, sin's so sweet. As minds ill bent Rarely repent, Untill they meet Their punishment. Who more can crave Then thou hast done: That gav'st a Sonne, To free a slave? First made of nought; Withall since bought. Sinne, Death, and Hell, His glorious Name Quite overcame, Yet I rebell, And slight the same. But, I'le come in, Before my losse, Me farther tosse, As sure to win Under his Crosse. A Hymne On the Nativitie of my Saviour. I Sing the birth, was borne to night, The Author both of Life, and light; The Angels so did sound it, And like the ravish'd Sheep'erds said, Who saw the light, and were afraid, Yet search'd, and true they found it. The Sonne of God, th'Eternall King, That did us all salvation bring, And freed the soule from danger; Hee whom the whole world could not take, The Word, which heaven, and earth did make; Was now laid in a Manger. The Fathers wisedome will'd it so, The Sonnes obedience knew no No, Both wills were in one stature; And as that wisedome had decreed, The Word was now made Flesh indeed, And tooke on him our Nature. What comfort by him doe wee winne? Who made himselfe the price of sinne, To make us heires of glory? To see this Babe, all innocence; A Martyr borne in our defence; Can man forget this Storie? A Celebration of Charis in ten Lyrick Peeces. 1. His Excuse for loving. Let it not your wonder move, Lesse your laughter; that I love. Though I now write fiftie yeares, I have had, and have my Peeres; PoÃ«ts, though devine are men: Some have lov'd as old agen. And it is not alwayes face, Clothes, or Fortune gives the grace; Or the feature, or the youth: But the Language, and the Truth, With the Ardor, and the Passion, Gives the Lover weight, and fashion. If you then will read the Storie, First, prepare you to be sorie, That you never knew till now, Either whom to love, or how: But be glad, as soone with me, When you know, that this is she, Of whose Beautie it was sung, She shall make the old man young. Keepe the middle age at stay, And let nothing high decay. Till she be the reason why, All the world for love may die. 2. How he saw her. I Beheld her, on a Day, When her looke out-flourisht May: And her dressing did out-brave All the Pride the fields than have: Farre I was from being stupid, For I ran and call'd on Cupid; Love if thou wilt ever see Marke of glorie, come with me; Where's thy Quiver? bend thy Bow: Here's a shaft, thou art to slow! And (withall) I did untie Every Cloud about his eye; But, he had not gain'd his sight Sooner, then he lost his might, Or his courage; for away Strait hee ran, and durst not stay, Letting Bow and Arrow fall, Nor for any threat, or Call, Could be brought once back to looke, I foole-hardie, there up tooke Both the Arrow he had quit, And the Bow: which thought to hit This my object. But she threw Such a Lightning (as I drew) At my face, that tooke my sight, And my motion from me quite; So that there, I stood a stone, Mock'd of all: and call'd of one (Which with griefe and wrath I heard) Cupids Statue with a Beard, Or else one that plaid his Ape, In a Hercules-his shape. 3. What hee suffered. After many scornes like these, Which the prouder Beauties please, She content was to restore Eyes and limbes; to hurt me more And would on Conditions, be Reconcil'd to Love, and me First, that I must kneeling yeeld Both the Bow, and shaft I held Unto her; which love might take At her hand, with oath, to make Mee, the scope of his next draught Aymed, with that selfe, same shaft He no sooner heard the Law, But the Arrow home did draw And (to gaine her by his Art) Left it sticking in my heart: Which when she beheld to bleed, She repented of the deed, And would faine have chang'd the fate, But the Pittie comes too late. Looser-like, now, all my wreake Is, that I have leave to speake, And in either Prose, or Song, To revenge me with my Tongue, Which how Dexterously I doe Heare and make Example too. 4. Her Triumph. See the Chariot at hand here of Love Wherein my Lady rideth! Each that drawes, is a Swan, or a Dove And well the Carre Love guideth As she goes, all hearts doe duty Unto her beauty; And enamour'd, doe wish, so they might But enjoy such a sight, That they still were, to run by her side, Through Swords, through Seas, whether she would ride. Doe but looke on her eyes, they doe light All that Loves world compriseth! Doe but looke on her Haire, it is bright As Loves starre when it riseth! Doe but marke her forhead's smoother Then words that sooth her! And from her arched browes, such a grace Sheds it selfe through the face, As alone there triumphs to the life. All the Gaine, all the Good, of the Elements strife. Have you seene but a bright Lillie grow, Before rude hands have touch'd it? Ha'you mark'd but the fall o'the Snow Before the soyle hath smutch'd it? Ha'you felt the wooll of Bever? Or Swans Downe ever? Or have smelt o'the bud o'the Brier? Or the Nard in the fire? Or have tasted the bag of the Bee? O so white! O so soft! O so sweet is she! 5. His discourse with Cupid. Noblest Charis, you that are Both my fortune, and my Starre! And doe governe more my blood, Then the various Moone the flood! Heare, what late Discourse of you, Love, and I have had; and true. 'Mongst my Muses finding me, Where he chanc't your name to see Set, and to this softer straine; Sure, said he, if I have Braine, This here sung, can be no other By description, but my Mother! So hath Homer prais'd her haire; So, Anacreon drawne the Ayre Of her face, and made to rise Just about her sparkling eyes, Both her Browes, bent like my Bow. By her lookes I doe her know, Which you call my Shafts. And see! Such my Mothers blushes be, As the Bath your verse discloses In her cheekes, of Milke, and Roses; Such as oft I wanton in? And, above her even chin, Have you plac'd the banke of kisses, Where you say, men gather blisses, Rip'ned with a breath more sweet, Then when flowers, and West-winds meet. Nay, her white and polish'd neck, With the Lace that doth it deck, Is my Mothers! Hearts of slaine Lovers, made into a Chaine! And betweene each rising breast, Lyes the Valley, cal'd my nest, Where I sit and proyne my wings After flight; and put new stings To my shafts! Her very Name, With my Mothers is the same. I confesse all, I replide, And the Glasse hangs by her side, And the Girdle 'bout her waste, All is Venus: save unchaste. But alas, thou seest the least Of her good, who is the best Of her Sex; But could'st thou Love, Call to mind the formes, that strove For the Apple, and those three Make in one, the same were shee. For this Beauty yet doth hide, Something more then thou hast spi'd Outward Grace weake love beguiles: Shee is Venus, when she smiles, But shee's Juno, when she walkes, And Minerva, when she talkes. 6. Clayming a second kisse by Desert. Charis guesse, and doe not misse, Since I drew a Morning kisse From your lips, and suck'd an ayre Thence, as sweet, as you are faire. What my Muse and I have done: Whether we have lost, or wonne, If by us, the oddes were laid, That the Bride (allow'd a Maid) Look'd not halfe so fresh, and faire, With th'advantage of her haire, And her Jewels, to the view Of th'Assembly, as did you! Or, that did you sit, or walke, You were more the eye, and talke Of the Court, to day, then all Else that glister'd in White-hall; So, as those that had your sight, Wisht the Bride were chang'd to night, And did thinke, such Rites were due To no other Grace but you! Or, if you did move to night In the Daunces, with what spight Of your Peeres, you were beheld, That at every motion sweld So to see a Lady tread, As might all the Graces lead, And was worthy (being so seene) To be envi'd of the Queene. Or if you would yet have stay'd, Whether any would up-braid To himselfe his losse of Time; Or have charg'd his sight of Crime, To have left all sight for you: Guesse of these, which is the true; And, if such a verse as this, May not claime another kisse. 7. Begging another, on colour of mending the former. For Loves-sake, kisse me once againe, I long, and should not beg in vaine, Here's none to spie, or see; Why doe you doubt, or stay? I'le taste as lightly as the Bee, That doth but touch his flower, and flies away. Once more, and (faith) I will be gone Can he that loves, aske lesse then one? Nay, you may erre in this, And all your bountie wrong: This could be call'd but halfe a kisse. What w'are but once to doe, we should doe long, I will but mend the last, and tell Where, how it would have relish'd well; Joyne lip to lip, and try: Each suck others breath. And whilst our tongues perplexed lie, Let who will thinke us dead, or wish our death. 8. Urging her of a promise. Charis one day in discourse Had of Love, and of his force, Lightly promis'd, she would tell What a man she could love well: And that promise set on fire All that heard her, with desire. With the rest, I long expected, When the worke would be effected: But we find that cold delay, And excuse spun every day, As, untill she tell her one, We all feare, she loveth none. Therefore, Charis, you must do't, For I will so urge you to't You shall neither eat, nor sleepe, No, nor forth your window peepe, With your emissarie eye, To fetch in the Formes goe by: And pronounce, which band or lace, Better fits him, then his face; Nay I will not let you sit 'Fore your Idoll Glasse a whit, To say over every purle There; or to reforme a curle; Or with Secretarie Sis To consult, if Fucus this Be as good, as was the last: All your sweet of life is past, Make accompt unlesse you can, (And that quickly) speake your Man. 9. Her man described by her owne Dictamen. Of your Trouble, Ben, to ease me, I will tell what Man would please me. I would have him if I could, Noble; or of greater Blood: Titles, I confesse, doe take me. And a woman, God did make me. French to boote, at least in fashion, And his Manners of that Nation. Young Il'd have him to, and faire, Yet a man; with crisped haire Cast in thousand snares, and rings For Loves fingers, and his wings: Chestnut colour, or more slack Gold, upon a ground of black. Venus, and Minerva's eyes For he must looke wanton-wise. Eye-brows bent like Cupids bow, Front, an ample field of snow; Even nose, and cheeke (withall) Smooth as is the Billiard Ball: Chin, as woolly as the Peach; And his lip should kissing teach, Till he cherish'd too much beard, And make Love or me afeard. He would have a hand as soft As the Downe, and shew it oft; Skin as smooth as any rush, And so thin to see a blush Rising through it e're it came; All his blood should be a flame Quickly fir'd as in beginners In loves schoole, and yet no sinners. 'Twere to long to speake of all, What we harmonie doe call In a body should be there. Well he should his clothes to weare; Yet no Taylor help to make him Drest, you still for man should take him; And not thinke h'had eat a stake, Or were set up in a Brake. Valiant he should be as fire, Shewing danger more then ire. Bounteous as the clouds to earth; And as honest as his Birth. All his actions to be such, As to doe nothing too much. Nor o're-praise, nor yet condemne; Nor out-valew, nor contemne; Nor doe wrongs, nor wrongs receave; Nor tie knots, nor knots unweave; And from basenesse to be free, As he durst love Truth and me. Such a man, with every part, I could give my very heart; But of one, if short he came, I can rest me where I am. 10. Another Ladyes exception present at the hearing. For his Mind, I doe not care, That's a Toy, that I could spare: Let his Title be but great, His Clothes rich, and band sit neat, Himselfe young, and face be good, All I wish is understood What you please, you parts may call, 'Tis one good part I'ld lie withall. The Musicall strife; In a Pastorall Dialogue. Shee. Come with our Voyces, let us warre, And challenge all the Spheares, Till each of us be made a Starre, And all the world turne Eares. Hee. At such a Call, what beast or fowle, Of reason emptie is! What Tree or stone doth want a soule? What man but must lose his? Shee. Mixe then your Notes, that we may prove To stay the running floods? To make the Mountaine Quarries move? And call the walking woods? Hee. What need of mee? doe you but sing Sleepe, and the Grave will wake, No tunes are sweet, nor words have sting, But what those lips doe make. Shee. They say the Angells marke each Deed, And exercise below, And out of inward pleasure feed On what they viewing know. Hee. O sing not you then, lest the best Of Angels should be driven To fall againe; at such a feast, Mistaking earth for heaven. Shee. Nay, rather both our soules bee strayn'd To meet their high desire; So they in state of Grace retain'd, May wish us of their Quire. A SONG. [Oh doe not wanton with those eyes] Oh doe not wanton with those eyes, Lest I be sick with seeing; Nor cast them downe, but let them rise, Lest shame destroy their being: O, be not angry with those fires, For then their threats will kill me; Nor looke too kind on my desires, For then my hopes will spill me; O, doe not steepe them in thy Tares, For so will sorrow slay me; Nor spread them as distract with feares, Mine owne enough betray me. In the person of Woman kind. A Song Apologetique. Men if you love us, play no more The fooles, or Tyrants with your friends, To make us still sing o're, and o're, Our owne false praises, for your ends: Wee have both wits, and fancies too, And if wee must, let's sing of you. Nor doe we doubt, but that we can, If wee would search with care, and paine, Find some one good, in some one man; So going thorow all your straine: Wee shall at last, of parcells make One good enough for a songs sake. And as a cunning Painter takes In any curious peece you see More pleasure while the thing he makes Then when 'tis made, why so will wee. And having pleas'd our art, wee'll try To make a new, and hang that by. Another. In defence of their Inconstancie. A Song. Hang up those dull, and envious fooles That talke abroad of Womans change, We were not bred to sit on stooles, Our proper vertue is to range: Take that away, you take our lives, We are no woman then, but wives. Such as in valour would excell Doe change, though man, and often fight Which we in love must doe aswell, If ever we will love aright. The frequent varying of the deed, Is that which doth perfection breed. Nor is't inconstancie to change For what is better, or to make (By searching) what before was strange, Familiar, for the uses sake; The good, from bad, is not descride, But as 'tis often vext and tri'd. And this profession of a store In love, doth not alone help forth Our pleasure; but preserves us more From being forsaken, then doth worth, For were the worthiest woman curst To love one man, hee'd leave her first. A Nymphs Passion. I Love, and he loves me againe, Yet dare I not tell who; For if the Nymphs should know my Swaine, I feare they'd love him too; Yet if it be not knowne, The pleasure is as good as none, For that's a narrow joy is but our owne. I'le tell, that if they be not glad, They yet may envie me: But then if I grow jealous madde, And of them pittied be, It were a plague 'bove scorne And yet it cannot be forborne. Unlesse my heart would as my thought be torne. He is if they can find him, faire, And fresh and fragrant too, As Summers sky, or purged Ayre, And lookes as Lillies doe, That are this morning blowne, Yet, yet I doubt he is not knowne, And feare much more, that more of him be showne. But he hath eyes so round, and bright, As make away my doubt, Where Love may all his Torches light Though hate had put them out; But then t'increase my feares, What Nymph so e're his voyce but heares Will be my Rivall, though she have but eares. I'le tell no more, and yet I love, And he loves me; yet no One un-becomming thought doth move From either heart, I know; But so exempt from blame, As it would be to each a fame: If Love, or feare, would let me tell his name. The Houre-glasse. Doe but consider this small dust, Here running in the Glasse, By Atomes mov'd; Could you beleeve, that this, The body was Of one that lov'd? And in his M?? flame, playing like a flye, Turn'd to cinders by her eye? Yes; and in death, as life unblest, To have't exprest, Even ashes of lovers find no rest. My Picture left in Scotland. I Now thinke, Love is rather deafe, then blind, For else it could not be, That she, Whom I adore so much, should so slight me, And cast my love behind: I'm sure my language to her, was as sweet, And every close did meet In sentence, of as subtile feet, As hath the youngest Hee, That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree. Oh, but my conscious feares, That flie my thoughts betweene, Tell me that she hath seene My hundreds of gray haires, Told seven and fortie yeares. Read so much wast, as she cannot imbrace My mountaine belly, and my rockie face, And all these through her eyes, have stopt her eares. Against Iealousie. Wretched and foolish Jealousie, How cam'st thou thus to enter me? I n're was of thy kind; Nor have I yet the narrow mind To vent that poore desire, That others should not warme them at my fire, I wish the Sun should shine On all mens Fruit, and flowers, as well as mine. But under the Disguise of love Thou sai'st, thou only cam'st to prove What my Affections were, Think'st thou that love is help'd by feare? Goe, get thee quickly forth Loves sicknesse, and his noted want of worth Seeke doubting Men to please, I ne're will owe my health to a disease. The Dreame. Or Scorne, or pittie on me take, I must the true Relation make, I am undone to Night; Love in a subtile Dreame disguis'd, Hath both my heart and me surpriz'd, Whom never yet he durst attempt t' awake; Nor will he tell me for whose sake He did me the Delight, Or Spight, But leaves me to inquire, In all my wild desire Of sleepe againe; who was his Aid, And sleepe so guiltie and afraid, As since he dares not come within my sight. An Epitaph on Master Vincent Corbet. I Have my Pietie too, which could It vent it selfe, but as it would, Would say as much, as both have done Before me here, the Friend and Sonne; For I both lost a friend and Father, Of him whose bones this Grave doth gather: Deare Vincent Corbet who so long Had wrestled with Diseases strong, That though they did possesse each limbe, Yet he broke them, e're they could him, With the just Canon of his life, A life that knew nor noise, nor strife: But was by sweetning so his will, All order, and Disposure, still His Mind as pure, and neatly kept, As were his Nourceries; and swept So of uncleannesse, or offence, That never came ill odour thence: And adde his Actions unto these, They were as specious as his Trees. 'Tis true, he could not reprehend His very Manners, taught t'amend, They were so even, grave, and holy; No stubbornnesse so stiffe, nor folly To licence ever was so light, As twice to trespasse in his sight, His lookes would so correct it, when It chid the vice, yet not the Men. Much from him I professe I wonne, And more, and more, I should have done, But that I understood him scant, Now I conceive him by my want, And pray who shall my sorrowes read, That they for me their teares will shed; For truly, since he left to be, I feele, I'm rather dead than he? Reader, whose life, and name, did e're become An Epitaph, deserv'd a Tombe: Nor wants it here through penurie, or sloth, Who makes the one, so't be first makes both. An Epistle to Sir Edvvard Sacvile, now Earle of Dorset. If Sackvile, all that have the power to doe Great and good turns, as wel could time them too, And knew their how, and where: we should have, then Lesse list of proud, hard, or ingratefull Men. For benefits are ow'd with the same mind As they are done, and such returnes they find: You then whose will not only, but desire To succour my necessities tooke fire, Not at my prayers, but your sense; which laid The way to meet, what others would upbraid; And in the Act did so my blush prevent, As I did feele it done, as soone as meant: You cannot doubt, but I who freely know This Good from you, as freely will it owe; And though my fortune humble me, to take The smallest courtesies with thankes, I make Yet choyce from whom I take them; and would shame To have such doe me good, I durst not name: They are the Noblest benefits, and sinke Deepest in Man, of which when he doth thinke, The memorie delights him more, from whom Then what he hath receiv'd. Gifts stinke from some, They are so long a comming, and so hard Where any Deed is forc't, the Grace is mard. Can I owe thankes, for Curtesies receiv'd Against his will that doe's 'hem? that hath weav'd Excuses, or Delayes? or done 'hem scant, That they have more opprest me, then my want? Or if he did it not to succour me, But by meere Chance? for interest? or to free Himselfe of farther trouble, or the weight Of pressure, like one taken in a streight? All this corrupts the thankes, lesse hath he wonne, That puts it in his Debt-booke e're't be done; Or that doth sound a Trumpet, and doth call His Groomes to witnesse; or else lets it fall In that proud manner: as a good so gain'd, Must make me sad for what I have obtain'd. No! Gifts and thankes should have one cheerefull face, So each, that's done, and tane, becomes a Brace. He neither gives, or do's, that doth delay A Benefit: or that doth throw't away No more then he doth thanke, that will receive Nought but in corners; and is loath to leave, Lest Ayre, or Print, but flies it: Such men would Run from the Conscience of it if they could. As I have seene some Infants of the Sword Well knowne, and practiz'd borrowers on their word, Give thankes by stealth, and whispering in the eare, For what they streight would to the world forsweare; And speaking worst of those, from whom they went But then, fist fill'd to put me off the sent. Now dam'mee, Sir, if you shall not command My Sword ('tis but a poore Sword understand) As farre as any poore Sword i'the Land, Then turning unto him is next at hand, Dam's whom he damn'd too, is the veriest Gull, H'as Feathers, and will serve a man to pull. Are they not worthy to be answer'd so, That to such Natures let their full hands flow, And seeke not wants to succour: but enquire Like Money-brokers; after Names, and hire Their bounties forth, to him that last was made, Or stands to be'n Commission o'the blade? Still, still, the hunters of false fame apply Their thoughts and meanes to making loude the cry; But one is bitten by the Dog he fed, And hurt seeks Cure, the Surgeon bids take bread, And spunge-like with it dry up the blood quite: Then give it to the Hound that did him bite; Pardon, sayes he, that were a way to see All the Towne-curs take each their snatch at me. O, is it so? knowes he so much? and will Feed those, at whom the Table points at still? I not deny it, but to helpe the need Of any, is a Great and generous Deed: Yea, of th'ingratefull: and he forth must tell Many a pound, and piece will pace one well; But these men ever want: their very trade Is borrowing, that but stopt they doe invade All as their prize, turne Pyrats here at Land, Ha'their Bermudas, and their streights i'th' Strand: Man out of their Boates to th' Temple, and not shift Now, but command; make tribute, what was gift; And it is paid'hem with a trembling zeale, And superstition I dare scarce reveale If it were cleare, but being so in cloud Carryed and wrapt, I only am aloud My wonder! why? the taking a Clownes purse, Or robbing the poore Market-folkes should nurse Such a religious horrour in the brests Of our Towne Gallantry! or why there rests Such worship due to kicking of a Punck! Or swaggering with the Watch, or Drawer drunke; Or feats of darknesse acted in Mid-Sun, And told of with more Licence then th'were done! Sure there is Misterie in it, I not know That men such reverence to such actions show! And almost deifie the Authors! make Lowd sacrifice of drinke, for their health-sake Reare Suppers in their Names! and spend whole nights Unto their praise, in certaine swearing rites; Cannot a man be reck'ned in the State Of Valour, but at this Idolatrous rate? I thought that Fortitude had beene a meane 'Twixt feare and rashnesse: not a lust obscene, Or appetite of offending, but a skill, Or Science of a discerning Good and Ill. And you Sir know it well to whom I write, That with these mixtures we put out her light Her ends are honestie, and publike good! And where they want, she is not understood. No more are these of us, let them then goe, I have the lyst of mine owne faults to know, Looke too and cure; Hee's not a man hath none, But like to be, that every day mends one, And feeles it; Else he tarries by the Beast, Can I discerne how shadowes are decreast, Or growne; by height or lownesse of the Sunne? And can I lesse of substance? when I runne, Ride, saile, am coach'd, know I how farre I have gone, And my minds motion not? or have I none: No! he must feele and know, that I will advance Men have beene great, but never good by chance, Or on the sudden. It were strange that he Who was this Morning such a one, should be Sydney e're night? or that did goe to bed Coriat, should rise the most sufficient head Of Christendome? And neither of these know Were the Rack offer'd them how they came so; 'Tis by degrees that men arrive at glad Profit in ought each day some little adde, In time 'twill be a heape; This is not true Alone in money, but in manners too. Yet we must more then move still, or goe on, We must accomplish; 'Tis the last Key-stone That makes the Arch, The rest that there were put Are nothing till that comes to bind and shut. Then stands it a triumphall marke! then Men Observe the strength, the height, the why, and when, It was erected; and still walking under Meet some new matter to looke up and wonder! Such Notes are vertuous men! they live as fast As they are high; are rooted and will last. They need no stilts, nor rise upon their toes, As if they would belie their stature, those Are Dwarfes of Honour, and have neither weight Nor fashion, if they chance aspire to height, 'Tis like light Canes, that first rise big and brave, Shoot forth in smooth and comely spaces; have But few and faire Devisions: but being got Aloft, grow lesse and streightned; full of knot. And last, goe out in nothing: You that see Their difference, cannot choose which you will be. You know (without my flatt'ring you) too much For me to be your Indice. Keep you such, That I may love your Person (as I doe) Without your gift, though I can rate that too, By thanking thus the curtesie to life, Which you will bury, but therein, the strife May grow so great to be example, when (As their true rule or lesson) either men Donnor's or Donnee's to their practise shall Find you to reckon nothing, me owe all. An Epistle to Master Iohn Selden. I Know to whom I write. Here, I am sure, Though I am short, I cannot be obscure: Lesse shall I for the Art or dressing care, Truth, and the Graces best, when naked are Your Booke, my Selden, I have read, and much Was trusted, that you thought my judgement such To aske it: though in most of workes it be A pennance, where a man may not be free. Rather then Office, when it doth or may Chance that the Friends affection proves Allay Unto the Censure. Yours all need doth flie Of this so vitious Humanitie. Then which there is not unto Studie, a more Pernitious enemie, we see before A many of bookes, even good judgements wound Themselves through favouring what is there not found: But I on yours farre otherwise shall doe, Not flie the Crime, but the Suspition too: Though I confesse (as every Muse hath err'd, And mine not least) I have too oft preferr'd Men, past their termes, and prais'd some names too much, But 'twas with purpose to have made them such, Since being deceiv'd, I turne a sharper eye Upon my selfe, and aske to whom? and why? And what I write? and vexe it many dayes Before men get a verse: much lesse a Praise; So that my Reader is assur'd, I now Meane what I speake: and still will keepe that Vow, Stand forth my Object, then you that have beene Ever at home: yet, have all Countries seene: And like a Compasse keeping one foot still Upon your Center, doe your Circle fill Of generall knowledge, watch'd men, manners too, Heard what times past have said, seene what ours doe: Which Grace shall I make love too first? your skill, Or faith in things? or is't your wealth and will T'instruct and teach? or your unweary'd paine Of Gathering? Bountie in pouring out againe? What fables have you vext! what truth redeem'd! Antiquities search'd! Opinions dis-esteem'd! Impostures branded! and Authorities urg'd, What blots and errours, have you watch'd and purg'd Records, and Authors of! how rectified, Times, manners, customes! Innovations spide! Sought out the Fountaines, Sources, Creekes, paths, wayes, And noted the beginnings and decayes! Where is that nominall marke, or reall rite, Forme Act or Ensigne, that hath scap'd your sight. How are Traditions there examin'd: how Conjectures retriv'd! And a Storie now And then of times (besides the bare Conduct Of what it tells us) weav'd in to instruct. I wonder'd at the richnesse, but am lost, To see the workmanship so'xceed the cost! To marke the excellent seas'ning of your Stile! And manly elocution, not one while With horrour rough, then rioting with wit! But to the Subject, still the Colours fit In sharpnesse of all Search, wisdome of Choise, Newnesse of Sense, Antiquitie of voyce! I yeeld, I yeeld, the matter of your praise Flowes in upon me, and I cannot raise A banke against it. Nothing but the round Large claspe of Nature, such a wit can bound Monarch in Letters! 'Mongst thy Titles showne Of others honours, thus, enjoy their owne, I first salute thee so; and gratulate With that thy Stile, thy keeping of thy State; In offering this thy worke to no great Name, That would, perhaps, have prais'd, and thank'd the same, But nought beyond. He thou hast given it to, Thy learned Chamber-fellow, knowes to doe It true respects. He will not only love Embrace, and cherish; but he can approve And estimate thy Paines; as having wrought In the same Mines of knowledge; and thence brought Humanitie enough to be a friend, And strength to be a Champion, and defend Thy gift 'gainst envie. O how I doe count Among my commings in, and see it mount, The Graine of your two friendships! Hayward and Selden! two Names that so much understand! On whom I could take up, and ne're abuse The Credit, what would furnish a tenth Muse! But here's no time, nor place, my wealth to tell, You both are modest. So am I. Farewell. An Epistle to a Friend, to perswade him to the Warres. Wake, friend from forth thy Lethargie: the Drum Beates brave, and loude in Europe, and bids come All that dare rowse: or are not loth to quit Their vitious ease, and be o'rewhelm'd with it. It is a call to keepe the spirits alive That gaspe for action, and would yet revive Mans buried honour, in his sleepie life: Quickning dead Nature, to her noblest strife. All other Acts of Worldlings, are but toyle In dreames, begun in hope, and end in spoile. Looke on th'ambitious man, and see him nurse, His unjust hopes, with praises begg'd, or (worse) Bought Flatteries, the issue of his purse, Till he become both their, and his owne curse! Looke on the false, and cunning man, that loves No person, nor is lov'd: what wayes he proves To gaine upon his belly; and at last Crush'd in the snakie brakes, that he had past! See, the grave, sower, and supercilious Sir In outward face, but inward, light as Furre, Or Feathers: lay his fortune out to show Till envie wound, or maime it at a blow! See him, that's call'd, and thought the happiest man, Honour'd at once, and envi'd (if it can Be honour is so mixt) by such as would For all their spight be like him if they could: No part or corner man can looke upon, But there are objects, bid him to be gone As farre as he can flie, or follow Day, Rather then here so bogg'd in vices stay The whole world here leaven'd with madnesse swells? And being a thing, blowne out of nought, rebells Against his Maker; high alone with weeds, And impious ranknesse of all Sects and seeds: Not to be checkt, or frighted now with fate, But more licentious made, and desperate! Our Delicacies are growne capitall, And even our sports are dangers! what we call Friendship is now mask'd Hatred! Justice fled, And shamefastnesse together! All lawes dead That kept man living! Pleasures only sought! Honour and honestie, as poore things thought As they are made! Pride, and stiffe Clownage mixt To make up Greatnesse! and mans whole good fix'd In bravery, or gluttony, or coyne, All which he makes the servants of the Groine, Thither it flowes, how much did Stallion spend To have his Court-bred-fillie there commend His Lace and Starch; And fall upon her back In admiration, stretch'd upon the rack Of lust, to his rich Suit and Title, Lord? I, that's a Charme and halfe! She must afford That all respect; She must lie downe: Nay more 'Tis there civilitie to be a whore; Hee's one of blood, and fashion! and with these The bravery makes, she can no honour leese To do't with Cloth, or Stuffes, lusts name might merit With Velvet, Plush, and Tissues, it is spirit. O, these so ignorant Monsters! light, as proud, Who can behold their Manners, and not clowd- Like upon them lighten? If nature could Not make a verse; Anger; or laughter would To see 'hem aye discoursing with their Glasse, How they may make some one that day an Asse Planting their Purles, and Curles spread forth like Net, And every Dressing for a Pitfall set To catch the flesh in, and to pound a Prick Be at their Visits, see 'hem squemish, sick Ready to cast, at one, whose band sits ill, And then, leape mad on a neat Pickardill; As if a Brize were gotten i'their tayle, And firke, and jerke, and for the Coach-man raile, And jealous each of other, yet thinke long To be abroad chanting some baudie song, And laugh, and measure thighes, then squeake, spring, itch, Doe all the tricks of a saut Lady Bitch; For t'other pound of sweet-meats, he shall feele That payes, or what he will. The Dame is steele, For these with her young Companie shee'll enter, Where Pittes, or Wright, or Modet would not venter, And comes by these Degrees, the Stile t'inherit Of woman of fashion, and a Lady of spirit: Nor is the title question'd with our proud, Great, brave, and fashion'd folke, these are allow'd Adulteries now, are not so hid, or strange, They're growne Commoditie upon Exchange; He that will follow but anothers wife, Is lov'd, though he let out his owne for life: The Husband now's call'd churlish, or a poore Nature, that will not let his Wife be a whore; Or use all arts, or haunt all Companies That may corrupt her, even in his eyes. The brother trades a sister; and the friend Lives to the Lord, but to the Ladies end. Lesse must not be thought on then Mistresse: or If it be thought kild like her Embrions; for, Whom no great Mistresse, hath as yet infam'd A fellow of course Letcherie, is nam'd The Servant of the Serving-woman in scorne, Ne're came to taste the plenteous Mariage-horne. Thus they doe talke. And are these objects fit For man to spend his money on? his wit? His time? health? soule? will he for these goe throw Those thousands on his back, shall after blow His body to the Counters, or the Fleete? Is it for these that fine man meets the street Coach'd, or on foot-cloth, thrice chang'd every day, To teach each suit, he has the ready way From Hide-Parke to the Stage, where at the last His deare and borrow'd Bravery he must cast? When not his Combes, his Curling-irons, his Glasse, Sweet bags, sweet Powders, nor sweet words will passe For lesse Securitie? O ? for these Is it that man pulls on himselfe Disease? Surfet? and Quarrell? drinkes the tother health? Or by Damnation voids it? or by stealth? What furie of sate is crept into our Feasts? What honour given to the drunkennest Guests? What reputation to beare one Glasse more? When oft the Bearer, is borne out of dore? This hath our ill-us'd freedome, and soft peace Brought on us, and will every houre increase Our vices, doe not tarry in a place, But being in Motion still (or rather in race) Tilt one upon another, and now beare This way, now that, as if their number were More then themselves, or then our lives could take, But both fell prest under the load they make. I'le bid thee looke no more, but flee, flee friend, This PrÃ¦cipice, and Rocks that have no end, Or side, but threatens Ruine. The whole Day Is not enough now, but the Nights to play: And whilst our states, strength, body, and mind we waste; Goe make our selves the Usurers at a cast. He that no more for Age, Cramps, Palsies, can Now use the bones, we see doth hire a man To take the box up for him; and pursues The Dice with glassen eyes, to the glad viewers Of what he throwes: Like letchers growne content To be beholders, when their powers are spent. Can we not leave this worme? or will we not? Is that the truer excuse? or have we got In this, and like, an itch of Vanitie, That scratching now's our best Felicitie? Well, let it goe. Yet this is better, then To lose the formes, and dignities of men To flatter my good Lord, and cry his Bowle Runs sweetly, as it had his Lordships Soule, Although, perhaps it has, what's that to me, That may stand by, and hold my peace? will he When I am hoarse, with praising his each cast, Give me but that againe, that I must wast In Sugar Candide, or in butter'd beere, For the recovery of my voyce? No, there Pardon his Lordship. Flattry's growne so cheape With him, for he is followed with that heape That watch, and catch, at what they may applaud As a poore single flatterer, without Baud Is nothing, such scarce meat and drinke he'le give, But he that's both, and slave to both, shall live, And be belov'd, while the Whores last. O times, Friend flie from hence; and let these kindled rimes: Light thee from hell on earth: where flatterers, spies, Informers, Masters both of Arts and lies; Lewd slanderers, soft whisperers that let blood The life, and fame-vaynes (yet not understood Of the poore sufferers) where the envious, proud, Ambitious, factious, superstitious, lowd Boasters, and perjur'd, with the infinite more PrÃ¦varicators swarme. Of which the store, (Because th'are every where amongst Man-kind Spread through the World) is easier farre to find, Then once to number, or bring forth to hand, Though thou wert Muster-master of the Land. Goe quit 'hem all. And take along with thee, Thy true friends wishes, Colby which shall be, That thine be just, and honest, that thy Deeds Not wound thy conscience, when thy body bleeds; That thou dost all things more for truth, then glory, And never but for doing wrong be sory; That by commanding first thy selfe, thou mak'st Thy person fit for any charge thou tak'st That fortune never make thee to complaine, But what she gives, thou dar'st give her againe; That whatsoever face thy fate puts on, Thou shrinke or start not; but be alwayes one, That thou thinke nothing great, but what is good, And from that thought strive to be understood. So, 'live or dead, thou wilt preserve a fame Still pretious, with the odour of thy name. And last, blaspheme not, we did never heare Man thought the valianter, 'cause he durst sweare No more, then we should thinke a Lord had had More honour in him, 'cause we'ave knowne him mad: These take, and now goe seeke thy peace in Warre, Who falls for love of God, shall rise a Starre. An Epitaph on Master Philip Gray. Reader stay, And if I had no more to say, But here doth lie till the last Day, All that is left of Philip Gray. It might thy patience richly pay: For, if such men as he could die, What suretie of life have thou, and I. Epistle To a Friend. They are not, Sir, worst Owers, that doe pay Debts when they can: good men may breake their day; And yet the noble Nature never grudge, 'Tis then a crime, when the Usurer is Judge. And he is not in friendship. Nothing there Is done for gaine: If't be 'tis not sincere. Nor should I at this time protested be, But that some greater names have broke with me, And their words too; where I but breake my Band, I adde that (but) because I understand That as the lesser breach: for he that takes Simply my Band, his trust in me forsakes, And lookes unto the forfeit. If you be Now so much friend, as you would trust in me, Venter a longer time, and willingly: All is not barren land, doth fallow lie. Some grounds are made the richer, for the Rest; And I will bring a Crop, if not the best. An Elegie. [Can Beautie that did prompt me first to write] Can Beautie that did prompt me first to write, Now threaten, with those meanes she did invite: Did her perfections call me on to gaze! Then like, then love; and now would they amaze! Or was she gracious a-farre off? but neere A terror? or is all this but my feare? That as the water makes things, put in't, streight, Crooked appeare; so that doth my conceipt: I can helpe that with boldnesse; And love sware, And fortune once, t'assist the spirits that dare. But which shall lead me on? both these are blind Such Guides men use not, who their way would find. Except the way be errour to those ends: And then the best are still, the blindest friends! Oh how a Lover may mistake! to thinke, Or love, or fortune blind, when they but winke To see men feare: or else for truth, and State, Because they would free Justice imitate, Vaile their owne eyes, and would impartially Be brought by us to meet our Destinie. If it be thus; Come love, and fortune goe, I'le lead you on; or if my fate will so, That I must send one first, my Choyce assignes, Love to my heart, and fortune to my lines. An Elegie. [By those bright Eyes, at whose immortall fires] By those bright Eyes, at whose immortall fires Love lights his torches to inflame desires; By that faire Stand, your forehead, whence he bends His double Bow, and round his Arrowes sends; By that tall Grove, your haire; whose globy rings He flying curles, and crispeth, with his wings. By those pure bathes your either cheeke discloses, Where he doth steepe himselfe in Milke and Roses; And lastly by your lips, the banke of kisses, Where men at once may plant, and gather blisses: Tell me (my lov'd Friend) doe you love or no? So well as I may tell in verse, 'tis so? You blush, but doe not: friends are either none, (Though they may number bodyes) or but one. I'le therefore aske no more, but bid you love; And so that either may example prove Unto the other; and live patternes, how Others, in time may love, as we doe now. Slip no occasion; As time stands not still, I know no beautie, nor no youth that will. To use the present, then, is not abuse, You have a Husband is the just excuse Of all that can be done him; Such a one As would make shift, to make himselfe alone, That which we can, who both in you, his Wife, His Issue, and all Circumstance of life As in his place, because he would not varie, Is constant to be extraordinarie. A Satyricall Shrub. A Womans friendship! God whom I trust in, Forgive me this one foolish deadly sin; Amongst my many other, that I may No more, I am sorry for so fond cause, say At fifty yeares, almost, to value it, That ne're was knowne to last above a fit? Or have the least of Good, but what it must Put on for fashion, and take up on trust: Knew I all this afore? had I perceiv'd, That their whole life was wickednesse, though weav'd Of many Colours; outward fresh, from spots, But their whole inside full of ends, and knots? Knew I, that all their Dialogues, and discourse, were such as I will now relate, or worse. Here, something is wanting. ? ? Knew I this Woman? yes; And you doe see, How penitent I am, or I should be? Doe not you aske to know her, she is worse Then all Ingredients made into one curse, And that pour'd out upon Man-kind can be! Thinke but the Sin of all her sex, 'tis she! I could forgive her being proud! a whore! Perjur'd! and painted! if she were no moreâ, But she is such, as she might, yet forestall The Divell; and be the damning of us all. A little Shrub growing by. Aske not to know this Man. If fame should speake His name in any mettall, it would breake. Two letters were enough the plague to teare Out of his Grave, and poyson every eare. A parcell of Court-durt, a heape, and masse Of all vice hurld together, there he was, Proud, false, and trecherous, vindictive, all That thought can adde, unthankfull, the lay-stall Of putrid flesh alive! of blood, the sinke! And so I leave to stirre him, lest he stinke. An Elegie. [Though Beautie be the Marke of praise] Though Beautie be the Marke of praise, And yours of whom I sing be such As not the World can praise too much, Yet is't your vertue now I raise. A vertue, like Allay, so gone Throughout your forme; as though that move, And draw, and conquer all mens love, This subjects you to love of one. Wherein you triumph yet: because 'Tis of your selfe, and that you use The noblest freedome, not to chuse Against or Faith, or honours lawes. But who should lesse expect from you, In whom alone love lives agen? By whom he is restor'd to men: And kept, and bred, and brought up true? His falling Temples you have rear'd The withered Garlands tane away; His Altars kept from the Decay, That envie wish'd, and Nature fear'd. And on them burne so chaste a flame, With so much Loyalties expence As Love t'aquit such excellence, Is gone himselfe into your Name. And you are he: the Dietie To whom all Lovers are design'd; That would their better objects find: Among which faithfull troope am I. Who as an off-spring at your shrine, Have sung this Hymne, and here intreat One sparke of your Diviner heat To light upon a Love of mine. Which if it kindle not, but scant Appeare, and that to shortest view, Yet give me leave t'adore in you What I, in her, am griev'd to want. An Ode. To himselfe. Where do'st thou carelesse lie Buried in ease and sloth? Knowledge, that sleepes, doth die; And this Securitie, It is the common Moath, That eats on wits, and Arts, and destroyes them both. Are all th'Aonian springs Dri'd up? lyes Thespia wast? Doth Clarius Harp want strings, That not a Nymph now sings! Or droop they as disgrac't, To see their Seats and Bowers by chattring Pies defac't? If hence thy silence be, As 'tis too just a cause; Let this thought quicken thee, Minds that are great and free, Should not on fortune pause, 'Tis crowne enough to vertue still, her owne applause. What though the greedie Frie Be taken with false Baytes Of worded Balladrie, And thinke it PoÃ«sie? They die with their conceits, And only pitious scorne, upon their folly waites. Then take in hand thy Lyre, Strike in thy proper straine, With Japhets lyne, aspire Sols Chariot for new fire, To give the world againe: Who aided him, will thee, the issue of Joves braine. And since our Daintie age, Cannot indure reproofe. Make not thy selfe a Page, To that strumpet the Stage, But sing high and aloofe, Safe from the wolves black jaw, and the dull Asses hoofe. The mind of the Frontispice to a Booke. From Death, and darke oblivion, ne're the same, The Mistresse of Mans life, grave Historie Razing the World to good and evill fame Doth vindicate it to eternitie. Wise Providence would so; that nor the good Might be defrauded, nor the great secur'd, But both might know their wayes were understood, When Vice alike in time with vertue dur'd Which makes that (lighted by the beamie hand Of Truth that searcheth the most Springs And guided by experience, whose straite wand Doth meet, whose lyne doth sound the depth of things:) Shee chearfully supporteth what she reares, Assisted by no strengths, but are her owne, Some note of which each varied Pillar beares, By which as proper titles, she is knowne Times witnesse, herald of Antiquitie, The light of Truth, and life of Memorie. An Ode to Iames Earle of Desmond, writ in Queene Elizabeths time, since lost, and recovered. Where art thou Genius? I should use Thy present Aide: Arise Invention, Wake, and put on the wings of Pindars Muse, To towre with my intention High, as his mind, that doth advance Her upright head, above the reach of Chance, Or the times envie: Cynthius, I applie My bolder numbers to thy golden Lyre: O, then inspire Thy Priest in this strange rapture; heat my braine With Delphick fire: That I may sing my thoughts, in some unvulgar straine. Rich beame of honour, shed your light On these darke rymes; that my affection May shine (through every chincke) to every fight graced by your Reflection! Then shall my Verses, like strong Charmes Breake the knit Circle of her Stonie Armes, That hold your spirit: And keepes your merit Lock't in her cold embraces, from the view Of eyes more true, Who would with judgement search, searching conclude, (As prov'd in you) True noblÃªsse. Palme growes straight, though handled ne're so rude? Nor thinke your selfe unfortunate, If subject to the jealous errors Of politique pretext, that wryes a State, Sinke not beneath these terrors: But whisper; O glad Innocence Where only a mans birth is his offence; Or the dis-favour, Of such as savour Nothing, but practise upon honours thrall. O vertues fall, When her dead essence (like the Anatomie in Surgeons hall) Is but a Statists theame, to read Phlebotomie. Let Brontes, and black Steropes, Sweat at the forge, their hammers beating; Pyracmon's houre will come to give them ease, Though but while mettal's heating: And, after all the Ãtnean Ire, Gold, that is perfect, will out-live the fire. For fury wasteth, As patience lasteth. No Armour to the mind! he is shot free From injurie, That is not hurt; not he, that is not hit; So fooles we see, Oft scape an Imputation, more through luck, then wit. But to your selfe most loyall Lord, (Whose heart in that bright Sphere flames clearest. Though many Gems be in your bosome stor'd, Unknowne which is the Dearest.) If I auspitiously devine, (As my hope tells) that our faire PhÅb's shine, Shall light those places, With lustrous Graces, Where darknesse with her glomie Sceptred hand, Doth now command. O then (my best-best lov'd) let me importune, That you will stand, As farre from all revolt, as you are now from Fortune. An Ode. [High spirited friend] High spirited friend, I send nor Balmes, nor Cor'sives to your wound, Your fate hath found, A gentler, and more agile hand, to tend The Cure of that, which is but corporall, And doubtfull Dayes (which were nam'd Criticall,) Have made their fairest flight, And now are out of sight. Yet doth some wholsome Physick for the mind, Wrapt in this paper lie, Which in the taking if you mis-apply, You are unkind. Your covetous hand, Happy in that faire honour it hath gain'd, Must now be rayn'd. True valour doth her owne renowne command In one full Action; nor have you now more To doe, then be a husband of that store. Thinke but how deare you bought, This same which you have caught, Such thoughts wil make you more in love with truth 'Tis wisdome and that high, For men to use their fortune reverently, Even in youth. An Ode. [Hellen, did Homer never see] Hellen, did Homer never see Thy beauties, yet could write of thee? Did Sappho on her seven-tongu'd Lute, So speake (as yet it is not mute) Of Phaos forme? or doth the Boy In whom Anacreon once did joy, Lie drawne to life, in his soft Verse, As he whom Maro did rehearse? Was Lesbia sung by learn'd Catullus? Or Delia's Graces, by Tibullus? Doth Cynthia, in Propertius song Shine more, then she the Stars among? Is Horace his each love so high Rap't from the Earth, as not to die? With bright Lycoris, Gallus choice, Whose fame hath an eternall voice. Or hath Corynna, by the name Her Ovid gave her, dimn'd the fame Of CÃ¦sars Daughter, and the line Which all the world then styl'd devine? Hath Petrarch since his Laura rais'd Equall with her? or Ronsart prais'd His new Cassandra, 'bove the old, Which all the Fate of Troy foretold? Hath our great Sydney, Stella set, Where never Star shone brighter yet? Or Constables Ambrosiack Muse, Made Dian, not his notes refuse? Have all these done (and yet I misse The Swan that so relish'd Pancharis) And shall not I my Celia bring, Where men may see whom I doe sing, Though I, in working of my song Come short of all this learned throng, Yet sure my tunes will be the best, So much my Subject drownes the rest. A Sonnet. To the noble Lady, the Lady Mary Worth. I that have been a lover, and could shew it, Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumbe, Since I exscribe your Sonnets, am become A better lover, and much better PoÃ«t. Nor is my Muse, or I asham'd to owe it. To those true numerous Graces; whereof some, But charme the Senses, others over-come Both braines and hearts; and mine now best doe know it: For in your verse all Cupids Armorie, His flames, his shafts, his Quiver, and his Bow, His very eyes are yours to overthrow. But then his Mothers sweets you so apply, Her joyes, her smiles, her loves, as readers take For Venus Ceston, every line you make. A Fit of Rime against Rime. Rime the rack of finest wits, That expresseth but by fits, True Conceipt Spoyling Senses of their Treasure, Cosening Judgement with a measure, But false weight. Wresting words, from their true calling; Propping Verse, for feare of falling To the ground. Joynting Syllabes, drowning Letters, Fastning Vowells, as with fetters They were bound! Soone as lazie thou wert knowne, All good PoÃ«trie hence was flowne, And are banish'd. For a thousand yeares together, All Pernassus Greene did wither, And wit vanish'd. Pegasus did flie away, At the Wells no Muse did stay, But bewail'd. So to see the Fountaine drie, And Apollo's Musique die, All light failed! Starveling rimes did fill the Stage, Not a PoÃ«t in an Age, Worth crowning. Not a worke deserving Baies, Nor a lyne deserving praise, Pallas frowning; Greeke was free from Rimes infection, Happy Greeke by this protection! Was not spoyled. Whilst the Latin, Queene of Tongues, Is not yet free from Rimes wrongs, But rests foiled. Scarce the hill againe doth flourish, Scarce the world a Wit doth nourish, To restore, PhÅbus to his Crowne againe; And the Muses to their braine; As before. Vulgar Languages that want Words, and sweetnesse, and be scant Of true measure, Tyran Rime hath so abused, That they long since have refused, Other ceasure; He that first invented thee, May his joynts tormented bee, Cramp'd forever; Still may Syllabes jarre with time, Stil may reason warre with rime, Resting never. May his Sense when it would meet, The cold tumor in his feet, Grow unsounder. And his Title be long foole, That in rearing such a Schoole, Was the founder. Presented upon a plate of Gold to his son Rob. E. of Salisbury, when he was also Tresurer. An Epigram On Willam Lord Burl: Lo: high %Treasurer of England. If thou wouldst know the vertues of Man-kind Read here in one, what thou in all canst find, And goe no farther: let this Circle be Thy Universe, though his Epitome Cecill, the grave, the wise, the great, the good, What is there more that can ennoble blood? The Orphans Pillar, the true Subjects shield, The poores full Store-house, and just servants field. The only faithfull Watchman for the Realme, That in all tempests, never quit the helme, But stood unshaken in his Deeds, and Name, And labour'd in the worke; not with the fame: That still was good for goodnesse sake, nor thought Upon reward, till the reward him sought. Whose Offices, and honours did surprize, Rather than meet him: And, before his eyes Clos'd to their peace, he saw his branches shoot, And in the noblest Families tooke root Of all the Land, who now at such a Rate, Of divine blessing, would not serve a State? An Epigram. To Thomas Lo: Elsmere, For a poore Man. the last Terme he sate Chancellor. So justest Lord, may all your Judgements be Lawes; and no change e're come to one decree: So, may the King proclaime your Conscience is Law, to his Law; and thinke your enemies his: So, from all sicknesse, may you rise to health, The Care, and wish still of the publike wealth, So may the gentler Muses, and good fame Still flie about the Odour of your Name; As with the safetie, and honour of the Lawes, You favour Truth, and me, in this mans Cause. For the same. Another to him. [The Judge his favour timely then extends] The Judge his favour timely then extends, When a good Cause is destitute of friends, Without the pompe of Counsell; or more Aide, Then to make falshood blush, and fraud afraid: When those good few, that her Defenders be, Are there for Charitie, and not for fee. Such shall you heare to Day, and find great foes Both arm'd with wealth, and slander to oppose, Who thus long safe, would gaine upon the times A right by the prosperitie of their Crimes; Who, though their guilt, and perjurie they know, Thinke, yea and boast, that they have done it so As though the Court pursues them on the sent, They will come of, and scape the Punishment, When this appeares, just Lord, to your sharp sight, He do's you wrong, that craves you to doe right. An Epigram to the Councellour that pleaded, and carried the Cause. That I hereafter, doe not thinke the Barre, The Seat made of a more then civill warre; Or the great Hall at Westminster, the field Where mutuall frauds are fought, and no side yeild; That henceforth, I beleeve nor bookes, nor men, Who 'gainst the Law, weave Calumnies myâ But when I read or heare the names so rife Of hirelings, wranglers, stitchers-to of strife, Hook-handed Harpies, gowned Vultures, put Upon the reverend Pleaders; doe now shut All mouthes, that dare entitle them (from hence) To the Wolves studie, or Dogs eloquence; Thou art my Cause: whose manners since I knew, Have made me to conceive a Lawyer new. So dost thou studie matter, men, and times, Mak'st it religion to grow rich by Crimes! Dar'st not abuse thy wisdome, in the Lawes, Or skill to carry out an evill cause! But first dost vexe, and search it! If not sound, Thou prov'st the gentler wayes, to clense the wound, And make the Scarre faire; If that will not be, Thou hast the brave scorne, to put back the fee! But in a businesse, that will bide the Touch, What use, what strength of reason! and how much Of Bookes, of Presidents, hast thou at hand? As if the generall store thou didst command Of Argument, still drawing forth the best, And not being borrowed by thee, but possest. So comm'st thou like a Chiefe into the Court Arm'd at all peeces, as to keepe a Fort Against a multitude; and (with thy Stile So brightly brandish'd) wound'st, defend'st! the while Thy Adversaries fall, as not a word They had, but were a Reed unto thy Sword. Then com'st thou off with Victorie and Palme, Thy Hearers Nectar, and thy Clients Balme, The Courts just honour, and thy Judges love. And (which doth all Atchievements get above) Thy sincere practise, breeds not thee a fame Alone, but all thy ranke a reverend Name. An Epigram. To the small Poxe. Envious and foule Disease, could there not be One beautie in an Age, and free from thee? What did she worth thy spight? were there not store Of those that set by their false faces more Then this did by her true? she never sought Quarrell with Nature, or in ballance brought Art her false servant; Nor, for Sir Hugh Plot, Was drawne to practise other hue, then that Her owne bloud gave her: Shee ne're had, nor hath Any beliefe, in Madam Baud-bees bath, Or Turners oyle of Talck. Nor ever got Spanish receipt, to make her teeth to rot. What was the cause then? Thought'st thou in disgrace Of Beautie, so to nullifie a face, That heaven should make no more; or should amisse, Make all hereafter, had'st thou ruin'd this. I, that thy Ayme was; but her fate prevail'd: And scorn'd, thou'ast showne thy malice, but hast fail'd. An Epitaph. [What Beautie would have lovely stilde] What Beautie would have lovely stilde, What manners prettie, Nature milde, What wonder perfect, all were fill'd, Upon record in this blest child. And, till the comming of the Soule To fetch the flesh, we keepe the Rowle. A Song. [Come, let us here enjoy the shade] Lover. Come, let us here enjoy the shade, For love; in shadow best is made. Though Envie oft his shadow be, None brookes the Sun-light worse then he. Mistres. Where love doth shine, there needs no Sunne, All lights into his one doth run; Without which all the world were darke; Yet he himselfe is but a sparke. Arbiter. A Sparke to set whole world a-fire, Who more they burne, they more desire, And have their being, their waste to see; And waste still, that they still might bee. Chorvs. Such are his powers, whom time hath stil'd, Now swift, now slow, now tame, now wild; Now hot, now cold, now fierce, now mild. The eldest God, yet still a Child. An Epistle to a friend. Sir, I am thankfull, first, to heaven, for you; Next to your selfe, for making your love true: Then to your love, and gift. And all's but due. You have unto my Store added a booke, On which with profit, I shall never looke, But must confesse from whom what gift I tooke. Not like your Countrie-neighbours, that commit Their vice of loving for a Christmasse fit; Which is indeed but friendship of the spit: But, as a friend, which name your selfe receave, And which you (being the worthier) gave me leave In letters, that mixe spirits, thus to weave. Which, how most sacred I will ever keepe, So may the fruitfull Vine my temples steepe, And Fame wake for me, when I yeeld to sleepe. Though you sometimes proclaime me too severe, Rigid, and harsh, which is a Drug austere In friendship, I confesse: But deare friend, heare. Little know they, that professe Amitie, And seeke to scant her come lie libertie, How much they lame her in her propertie. And lesse they know, who being free to use That friendship which no chance but love did chuse, Will unto Licence that faire leave abuse. It is an Act of tyrannie, not love In practiz'd friendship wholly to reprove, As flatt'ry with friends humours still to move. From each of which I labour to be free, Yet if with eithers vice I teynted be, Forgive it, as my frailtie, and not me. For no man lives so out of passions sway, But shall sometimes be tempted to obey Her furie, yet no friendship to betray. An Elegie. ['Tis true, I'm broke! Vowes, Oathes, and all I had] 'Tis true, I'm broke! Vowes, Oathes, and all I had Of Credit lost. And I am now run madde: Or doe upon my selfe some desperate ill; This sadnesse makes no approaches, but to kill. It is a Darknesse hath blockt up my sense, And drives it in to eat on my offence, Or there to sterve it, helpe O you that may Alone lend succours, and this furie stay, Offended Mistris, you are yet so faire, As light breakes from you, that affrights despaire, And fills my powers with perswading joy, That you should be too noble to destroy. There may some face or menace of a storme Looke forth, but cannot last in such forme. If there be nothing worthy you can see Of Graces, or your mercie here in me Spare your owne goodnesse yet; and be not great In will and power, only to defeat. God, and the good, know to forgive, and save. The ignorant, and fooles, no pittie have. I will not stand to justifie my fault, Or lay the excuse upon the Vintners vault; Or in confessing of the Crime be nice, Or goe about to countenance the vice, By naming in what companie 'twas in, As I would urge Authoritie for sinne. No, I will stand arraign'd, and cast, to be The Subject of your Grace in pardoning me, And (Stil'd your mercies Creature) will live more Your honour now, then your disgrace before, Thinke it was frailtie, Mistris, thinke me man, Thinke that your selfe like heaven forgive me can, Where weaknesse doth offend, and vertue grieve, There greatnesse takes a glorie to relieve. Thinke that I once was yours, or may be now, Nothing is vile, that is a part of you: Errour and folly in me may have crost Your just commands; yet those, not I be lost. I am regenerate now, become the child Of your compassion; Parents should be mild: There is no Father that for one demerit, Or two, or three, a Sonne will dis-inherit, That is the last of punishments is meant; No man inflicts that paine, till hope be spent: An ill-affected limbe (what e're it aile) We cut not off, till all Cures else doe faile: And then with pause; for sever'd once, that's gone; Would live his glory that could keepe it on: Doe not despaire my mending; to distrust Before you prove a medicine, is unjust, You may so place me, and in such an ayre As not alone the Cure, but scarre be faire. That is, if still your Favours you apply, And not the bounties you ha'done, deny. Could you demand the gifts you gave, againe! Why was't? did e're the Cloudes aske back their raine? The Sunne his heat, and light, the ayre his dew? Or winds the Spirit, by which the flower so grew? That were to wither all, and make a Grave Of that wise Nature would a Cradle have? Her order is to cherish, and preserve, Consumptions nature to destroy, and sterve. But to exact againe what once is given, Is natures meere obliquitie! as Heaven Should aske the blood, and spirits he hath infus'd In man, because man hath the flesh abus'd. O may your wisdome take example hence, God lightens not at mans each fraile offence, He pardons, slips, goes by a world of ills, And then his thunder frights more, then it kills. He cannot angrie be, but all must quake, It shakes even him, that all things else doth shake. And how more faire, and lovely lookes the world In a calme skie; then when the heaven is horl'd About in Cloudes, and wrapt in raging weather, As all with storme and tempest ran together. O imitate that sweet Serenitie That makes us live; not that which calls to die In darke, and sullen mornes; doe we not say This looketh like an Execution day? And with the vulgar doth it not obtaine The name of Cruell weather, storme, and raine? Be not affected with these markes too much Of crueltie, lest they doe make you such. But view the mildnesse of your Makers state, As I the penitents here emulate: He when he sees a sorrow such as this, Streight puts off all his Anger, and doth kisse The contrite Soule, who hath no thought to win Upon the hope to have another sin Forgiven him; And in that lyne stand I Rather then once displease you more, to die To suffer tortures, scorne, and Infamie, What Fooles, and all their Parasites can apply; The wit of Ale, and Genius of the Malt Can pumpe for; or a Libell without salt Produce; though threatning with a coale, or chalke On every wall, and sung where e're I walke. I number these as being of the Chore Of Contumelie, and urge a good man more Then sword, or fire, or what is of the race To carry noble danger in the face: There is not any punishment, or paine, A man should flie from, as he would disdaine. Then Masters here, here let your rigour end, And let your mercie make me asham'd t'offend. I will no more abuse my vowes to you, Then I will studie falshood, to be true. O, that you could but by dissection see How much you are the better part of me; How all my Fibres by your Spirit doe move, And that there is no life in me, but love. You would be then most confident, that tho Publike affaires command me now to goe Out of your eyes, and be awhile away; Absence, or Distance, shall not breed decay. Your forme shines here, here fixed in my heart I may dilate my selfe, but not depart. Others by common Stars their courses run, When I see you, then I doe see my Sun, Till then 'tis all but darknesse, that I have, Rather then want your light, I wish a grave. An Elegie. [To make the Doubt cleare that no Woman's true] To make the Doubt cleare that no Woman's true, Was it my fate to prove it full in you. Thought I but one had breath'd the purer Ayre, And must she needs be false, because she's faire? It is your beauties Marke, or of your youth, Or your perfection not to studie truth; Or thinke you heaven is deafe? or hath no eyes? Or those it has, winke at your perjuries; Are vowes so cheape with women? or the matter Whereof they are made, that they are writ in water; And blowne away with wind? or doth their breath Both hot and cold at once, threat life and death? Who could have thought so many accents sweet Tun'd to our words, so many sighes should meet Blowne from our hearts, so many oathes and teares Sprinkled among? All sweeter by our feares, And the Devine Impression of stolne kisses, That seal'd the rest, could now prove emptie blisses? Did you draw bonds to forfeit? Signe, to breake, Or must we read you quite from what you speake, And find the truth out the wrong way? or must He first desire you false, would wish you just? O, I prophane! though most of women be, The common Monster, Love shall except thee My dearest Love, how ever jealousie, With Circumstance might urge the contrarie. Sooner I'le thinke the Sunne would cease to cheare The teeming Earth, and that forget to beare; Sooner that Rivers would run back, or Thames With ribs of Ice in June would bind his streames: Or Nature, by whose strength the world indures, Would change her course, before you alter yours: But, O, that trecherous breast, to whom, weake you Did trust our counsells, and we both may rue, Having his falshood found too late! 'twas he That made me cast you Guiltie, and you me. Whilst he black wretch, betray'd each simple word We spake unto the comming of a third! Curst may he be that so our love hath slaine, And wander wretched on the earth, as Cain. Wretched as he, and not deserve least pittie In plaguing him let miserie be wittie. Let all eyes shun him, and he shun each eye, Till he be noysome as his infamie; May be without remorse deny God thrice, And not be trusted more on his soules price; And after all selfe-torment, when he dyes May Wolves teare out his heart, Vultures his eyes, Swyne eat his Bowels, and his falser Tongue, That utter'd all, be to some Raven flung, And let his carrion corse be a longer feast To the Kings Dogs, then any other beast. Now I have curst, let us our love receive; In me the flame was never more alive. I could begin againe to court and praise, And in that pleasure lengthen the short dayes Of my lifes lease; like Painters that doe take Delight, not in made workes, but whilst they make I could renew those times, when first I saw Love in your eyes, that gave my tongue the Law To like what you lik'd, and at Masques, or Playes, Commend the selfe-same Actors, the same wayes Aske how you did? and often with intent Of being officious, grow impertinent; All which were such lost pastimes, as in these Love was as subtly catch'd as a Disease. But, being got, it is a treasure, sweet, Which to defend, is harder then to get; And ought not be prophan'd on either part, For though 'tis got by chance, 'tis kept by art. An Elegie. [That Love's a bitter sweet, I ne're conceive] That Love's a bitter sweet, I ne're conceive Till the sower Minute comes of taking leave, And then I taste it. But as men drinke up In hast the bottome of a med'cin'd Cup, And take some sirrup after; so doe I To put all relish from my memorie Of parting, drowne it in the hope to meet Shortly againe: and make our absence sweet. This makes me M?? that sometime by stealth Under another Name, I take your health; And turne the Ceremonies of those Nights I give, or owe my friends, into your Rites, But ever without blazon, or least shade Of vowes so sacred, and in silence made; For though Love thrive, and may grow up with cheare, And free societie, hee's borne else-where, And must be bred, so to conceale his birth, As neither wine doe rack it out, or mirth. Yet should the Lover still be ayrie and light In all his Actions ratified to spright Not like a Midas shut up in himselfe, And turning all he toucheth into pelfe, Keepe in reserv'd in his Dark-lanterne face, As if that ex'lent Dulnesse were Loves grace; No Masters no, the open merrie Man Moves like a sprightly River, and yet can Keepe secret in his Channels what he breedes 'Bove all your standing waters, choak'd with weedes. They looke at best like Creame-bowles, and you soone Shall find their depth: they're sounded with a spoone. They may say Grace, and for Loves Chaplaines passe; But the grave Lover ever was an Asse; Is fix'd upon one leg, and dares not come Out with the other, for hee's still at home; Like the dull wearied Crane that (come on land) Doth while he keepes his watch, betray his stand. Where he that knowes will like a Lapwing flie Farre from the Nest, and so himselfe belie. To others as he will deserve the Trust Due to that one, that doth believe him just. And such your Servant is, who vowes to keepe The Jewell of your name, as close as sleepe Can lock the Sense up, or the heart a thought, And never be by time, or folly brought, Weaknesse of braine, or any charme of Wine, The sinne of Boast, or other countermine (Made to blow up loves secrets) to discover That Article, may nor become our lover: Which in assurance to your brest I tell, If I had writ no word, but Deare, farewell. An Elegie. [Since you must goe, and I must bid farewell] Since you must goe, and I must bid farewell, Heare Masters, your departing servant tell What it is like: And doe not thinke they can Be idle words, though of a parting Man; It is as if a night should shade noone-day, Or that the Sun was here, but forc't away; And we were left under that Hemisphere, Where we must feele it Darke for halfe a yeare. What fate is this to change mens dayes and houres, To shift their seasons, and destroy their powers! Alas I ha'lost my heat, my blood, my prime, Winter is come a Quarter e're his Time, My health will leave me; and when you depart, How shall I doe sweet Mistris for my heart? You would restore it? No, that's worth a feare, As if it were not worthy to be there: O, keepe it still; for it had rather be Your sacrifice, then here remaine with me. And so I spare it, Come what can become Of me, I'le softly tread unto my Tombe; Or like a Ghost walke silent amongst men, Till I may See both it and you agen. An Elegie. [Let me be what I am, as Virgil cold] Let me be what I am, as Virgil cold As Horace fat; or as Anacreon old; No Poets verses yet did ever move, Whose Readers did not thinke he was in love. Who shall forbid me then in Rithme to bee As light, and Active as the youngest hee That from the Muses fountaines doth indorse His lynes, and hourely sits the Poets horse Put on my Ivy Garland, let me see Who frownes, who jealous is, who taxeth me. Fathers, and Husbands, I doe claime a right In all that is call'd lovely: take my sight Sooner then my affection from the faire. No face, no hand, proportion, line, or Ayre Of beautie; but the Muse hath interest in: There is not worne that lace, purle, knot or pin, But is the PoÃ«ts matter: And he must When he is furious love, although not lust. But then content, your Daughters and your Wives, (If they be faire and worth it) have their lives Made longer by our praises. Or, if not Wish, you had fowle ones, and deformed got; Curst in their Cradles, or there chang'd by Elves, So to be sure you doe injoy your selves. Yet keepe those up in sackcloth too, or lether, For Silke will draw some sneaking Songster thither. It is a ryming Age, and Verses swarme At every stall; The Cittie Cap's a charme. But I who live, and have liv'd twentie yeare Where I may handle Silke, as free, and neere, As any Mercer; or the whale-bone man That quilts those bodies, I have leave to span: Have eaten with the Beauties, and the wits, And braveries of Court, and felt their fits Of love, and hate: and came so nigh to know Whether their faces were their owne, or no. It is not likely I should now looke downe Upon a Velvet Petticote, or a Gowne, Whose like I have knowne the Taylors Wife put on To doe her Husbands rites in, e're 'twere gone Home to the Customer: his Letcherie Being, the best clothes still to prÃ¦occupie. Put a Coach-mare in Tissue, must I horse Her presently? Or leape thy Wife of force. When by thy sordid bountie she hath on, A Gowne of that, was the Caparison? So I might dote upon thy Chaires; and Stooles That are like cloath'd, must I be of those fooles Of race accompted, that no passion have But when thy Wife (as thou conceiv'st) is brave? Then ope thy wardrobe, thinke me that poore Groome that from the Foot-man, when he was become An Officer there, did make most solemne love, To ev'ry Petticote he brush'd, and Glove He did lay up, and would adore the shooe, Or slipper was left off, and kisse it too, Court every hanging Gowne, and after that, Lift up some one, and doe, I tell not what. Thou didst tell me; and wert o're-joy'd to peepe In at a hole, and see these Actions creepe From the poore wretch, which though he play'd in prose, He would have done in verse, with any of those Wrung on the Withers, by Lord Loves despight, Had he had the facultie to reade, and write! Such Songsters there are store of; witnesse he That chanc'd the lace, laid on a Smock, to see And straight-way spent a Sonnet; with that other That (in pure Madrigall) unto his Mother Commended the French-hood, and Scarlet gowne The Lady Mayresse pass'd in through the Towne, Unto the Spittle Sermon. O, what strange Varietie of Silkes were on th'Exchange! Or in Moore-fields! this other night, sings one, Another answers, 'Lasse those Silkes are none In smiling L'envoye, as he would deride Any Comparison had with his Cheap-side. And vouches both the Pageant, and the Day, When not the Shops, but windowes doe display The Stuffes, the Velvets, Plushes, Fringes, Lace, And all the originall riots of the place: Let the poore fooles enjoy their follies, love A Goat in Velvet; or some block could move Under that cover; an old Mid-wives hat! Or a Close-stoole so cas'd; or any fat Bawd, in a Velvet scabberd! I envy None of their pleasures! nor will aske thee, why Thou art jealous of thy Wifes, or Daughters Case: More then of eithers manners, wit, or face! An Execration upon Vulcan. And why to me this, thou lame Lord of fire, What had I done that might call on thine ire? Or urge thy Greedie flame, thus to devoure So many my Yeares-labours in an houre? I ne're attempted Vulcan 'gainst thy life; Nor made least line of love to thy loose Wife; Or in remembrance of thy afront, and scorne With Clownes, and Tradesmen, kept thee clos'd in horne. 'Twas Jupiter that hurl'd thee headlong downe, And Mars, that gave thee a Lanthorne for a Crowne? Was it because thou wert of old denied By Jove to have Minerva for thy Bride. That since thou tak'st all envious care and paine, To ruine any issue of the braine? Had I wrote treason there, or heresie, Imposture, witchcraft, charmes, or blasphemie? I had deserv'd then, thy consuming lookes, Perhaps, to have beene burned with my bookes. But, on thy malice, tell me, didst thou spie Any, least loose, or surrile paper, lie Conceal'd, or kept there, that was fit to be, By thy owne vote, a sacrifice to thee? Did I there wound the honours of the Crowne? Or taxe the Glories of the Church, and Gowne? Itch to defame the State? or brand the Times? And my selfe most, in some selfe-boasting Rimes? If none of these, then why this fire? Or find A cause before; or leave me one behind. Had I compil'd from Amadis de Gaule, Th'Esplandians, Arthur's, Palmerins, and all The learned Librarie of Don Quixote; And so some goodlier monster had begot, Or spun out Riddles, and weav'd fittie tomes Of Logogriphes, and curious Palindromes, Or pomp'd for those hard trifles Anagrams, Or Eteostichs, or those finer flammes Of Egges, and Halberds, Cradles, and a Herse, A paire of Scisars, and a Combe in verse; Acrostichs, and Telestichs, on jumpe names, Thou then hadst had some colour for thy flames, On such my serious follies; But, thou'lt say, There were some pieces of as base allay, And as false stampe there; parcels of a Play, Fitter to see the fire-light, then the day; Adulterate moneys, such as might not goe: Thou should'st have stay'd, till publike fame said so. Shee is the Judge, Thou Executioner, Or if thou needs would'st trench upon her power, Thou mightst have yet enjoy'd thy crueltie With some more thrift, and more varietie: Thou mightst have had me perish, piece, by piece, To light Tobacco, or save roasted Geese. Sindge Capons, or poore Pigges, dropping their eyes; Condemn'd me to the Ovens with the pies; And so, have kept me dying a whole age, Not ravish'd all hence in a minutes rage. But that's a marke, wherof thy Rites doe boast, To make consumption, ever where thou go'st; Had I fore-knowne of this thy least desire T'have held a Triumph, or a feast of fire, Especially in paper; that, that steame Had tickled your large Nosthrill: many a Reame To redeeme mine, I had sent in enough, Thou should'st have cry'd, and all beene proper stuffe. The Talmud, and the Alcoran had come, With pieces of the Legend; The whole summe Of errant Knight-hood, with the Dames, and Dwarfes; The charmed Boates, and the inchanted Wharfes, The Tristram's, Lanc'lots, Turpins, and the Peer's, All the madde Rolands, and sweet Oliveer's; To Merlins Marvailes, and his Caballs losse, With the ChimÃ¦ra of the Rosie-Crosse, Their Seales, their Characters, Hermetique rings, Their Jemme of Riches, and bright Stone, that brings Invisibilitie, and strength, and tongues: The art of kindling the true Coale, by lungs With Nicholas Pasquill's, Meddle with your match, And the strong lines, that so the time doe catch, Or Captaine Pamplets horse, and foot; that sallie Upon th'Exchange, still out of Popes-head-Alley, The weekly Corrants, with Pauls Seale; and all Th'admir'd discourses of the Prophet Ball: These, had'st thou pleas'd either to dine, or sup, Had made a meale for Vulcan to lick up. But in my Deske, what was there to accite So ravenous, and vast an appetite? I dare not say a body, but some parts There were of search, and mastry in the Arts. All the old Venusine, in PoÃ«trie, and lighted by the Stagerite, could spie, Was there mad English: with the Grammar too, To teach some that, their Nurses could doe. The puritie of Language; and among The rest, my journey into Scotland song, With all th'adventures; Three bookes not afraid To speake the fate of the Sicilian Maid To our owne Ladyes; and in storie there Of our fift Henry, eight of his nine yeare; Wherein was oyle, beside the succour spent, Which noble Carew, Cotton, Selden lent: And twice-twelve-yeares stor'd up humanitie, With humble Gleanings in Divinitie; After the Fathers, and those wiser Guides Whom Faction had not drawne to studie sides. How in these ruines Vulcan, thou dost lurke, All soote, and embers! odious, as thy worke! I now begin to doubt, if ever Grace, Or Goddesse, could be patient of thy face. Thou woo Minerva! or to wit aspire! 'Cause thou canst halt, with us in Arts, and Fire! Sonne of the Wind! for so thy mother gone With lust conceiv'd thee; Father thou hadst none When thou wert borne, and that thou look'st at best, She durst not kisse, but flung thee from her brest. And so did Jove, who ne're meant thee his Cup: No mar'le the Clownes of Lemnos tooke thee up. For none but Smiths would have made thee a God. Some Alchimist there may be yet, or odde Squire of the Squibs, against the Pageant day, May to thy name a Vulcanale say; And for it lose his eyes with Gun-powder, As th'other may his braines with Quicksilver. Well-fare the Wise-man yet, on the Banckside, My friends, the Watermen! They could provide Against thy furie, when to serve their needs, They made a Vulcan of a sheafe of Reedes, Whom they durst handle in their holy-day coates, And safely trust to dresse, not burne their Boates. But, O those Reeds! thy meere disdaine of them, Made thee beget that cruell Stratagem, (Which, some are pleas'd to stile but thy madde pranck) Against the Globe, the Glory of the Banke. Which, though it were the Fort of the whole Parish, Flanck'd with a Ditch, and forc'd out of a Marish, I saw with two poore Chambers taken in And raz'd; e're thought could urge, this might have beene! See the worlds Ruines! nothing but the piles Left! and wit since to cover it with Tiles. The Brethren, they streight nois'd it out for Newes, 'Twas verily some Relique of the Stewes. And this a Sparkle of that fire let loose That was lock'd up in the Winchestrian Goose Bred on the Banck, in time of Poperie, When Venus there maintain'd in Misterie. But, others fell, with that conceipt by the eares, And cry'd, it was a threatning to the beares; And that accursed ground, the Parish-Garden: Nay, sigh'd, ah Sister 'twas the Nun, Kate Arden Kindled the fire! But, then did one returne, No Foole would his owne harvest spoile, or burne! If that were so, thou rather would'st advance The place, that was thy Wives inheritance. O no, cry'd all. Fortune, for being a whore, Scap'd not his Justice any jot the more: He burnt that Idoll of the Revels too: Nay, let White-Hall with Revels have to doe, Though but in daunces, it shall know his power; There was a Judgement shew'n too in an houre. Hee is true Vulcan still! He did not spare Troy, though it were so much his Venus care. Foole, wilt thou let that in example come? Did not she save from thence, to build a Rome? And what hast thou done in these pettie spights, More then advanc'd the houses, and their rites? I will not argue thee, from those of guilt, For they were burnt, but to be better built. 'Tis true, that in thy wish they were destroy'd, Which thou hast only vented, not enjoy'd. So would'st th'have run upon the Rolls by stealth, And didst invade part of the Common-wealth, In those Records, which were all Chronicles gone, Will be remembred by Six Clerkes, to one. But, say all sixe, Good Men, what answer yee? Lyes there no Writ, out of the Chancerie Against this Vulcan? No Injunction? No order? no Decree? Though we be gone At Common-Law: Me thinkes in his despight A Court of Equitie should doe us right. But to confine him to the Brew-houses, The Glasse-house, Dye-fats, and their Fornaces; To live in Sea-coale, and goe forth in smoake; Or lest that vapour might the Citie choake, Condemne him to the Brick-kills, or some Hill- foot (out in Sussex) to an iron Mill; Or in small Fagots have him blaze about Vile Tavernes, and the Drunkards pisse him out; Or in the Bell-Mans Lanthorne like a spie, Burne to a snuffe, and then stinke out, and die: I could invent a sentence, yet were worse; But I'le conclude all in a civill curse. Pox on your flameship, Vulcan; if it be To all as fatall as't hath beene to me, And to Pauls-Steeple; which was unto us 'Bove all your Fire-workes, had at Ephesus, Or Alexandria; and though a Divine Losse, remaines yet, as unrepair'd as mine. Would you had kept your Forge at Ãtna still, And there made Swords, Bills, Glaves, and Armes your fill. Maintain'd the trade at Bilbo; or else-where; Strooke in at Millan with the Cutlers there; Or stay'd but where the Fryar, and you first met, Who from the Divels-Arse did Guns beget, Or fixt in the Low-Countrey's, where you might On both sides doe your mischiefes with delight; Blow up, and ruine, myne, and countermyne, Make your Petards, and Granats, all your fine Engines of Murder, and receive the praise Of massacring Man-kind so many wayes. We aske your absence here, we all love peace, And pray the fruites thereof, and the increase; So doth the King, and most of the Kings men That have good places: therefore once agen, Pox on thee Vulcan, thy Pandora's pox, And all the Evils that flew out of her box Light on thee: Or if those plagues will not doo, Thy Wives pox on thee, and B. Bs. too. A speach according to Horace. Why yet my noble hearts they cannot say, But we have Powder still for the Kings Day, And Ord'nance too: so much as from the Tower T'have wak'd, if sleeping, Spaines Ambassadour Old Ãsope Gundomar: the French can tell, For they did see it the last tilting well, That we have Trumpets, Armour, and great Horse, Launces, and men, and some a breaking force. They saw too store of feathers, and more may, If they stay here, but till Saint Georges Day. All Ensignes of a Warre, are not yet dead, Nor markes of wealth so from our Nation fled, But they may see Gold-Chaines, and Pearle worne then, Lent by the London Dames, to the Lords men; Withall, the dirtie paines those Citizens take, To see the Pride at Court, their Wives doe make: And the returne those thankfull Courtiers yeeld To have their Husbands drawne forth to the field, And comming home, to tell what acts were done Under the Auspice of young Swynnerton. What a strong Fort old Pimblicoe had beene! How it held out! how (last) 'twas taken in! Well, I say thrive, thrive brave Artillerie yard, Thou Seed-plot of the warre, that hast not spar'd Powder, or paper, to bring up the youth Of London, in the Militarie truth, These ten yeares day; As all may sweare that looke But on thy practise, and the Posture booke: He that but saw thy curious Captaines drill, Would thinke no more of Vlushing, or the Brill: But give them over to the common eare For that unnecessarie Charge they were Well did thy craftie Clerke, and Knight, Sir Hugh Supplant bold Panton; and brought there to view Translated Ãlian tactickes to be read, And the Greeke Discipline (with the moderne) shed So, in that ground, as soone it grew to be The Cittie-Question, whether Tilly, or he, Were now the greater Captaine? for they saw The Berghen siege, and taking in Breda, So acted to the life, as Maurice might, And Spinola have blushed at the sight, O happie Art! and wise Epitome Of bearing Armes! most civill Soldierie! Thou canst draw forth thy forces, and fight drie The Battells of thy Aldermanitie; Without the hazard of a drop of blood: More then the surfets, in thee, that day stood, Goe on, increast in vertue; and in fame: And keepe the Glorie of the English name, Up among Nations. In the stead of bold Beauchamps, and Nevills, Cliffords, Audley's old; Insert thy Hodges, and those newer men. Waller. As Stiles, Dike, Ditchfield, Millar, Crips, and Fen: That keepe the warre, though now't be growne more tame Alive yet, in the noise; and still the same And could (if our great men would let their Sonnes Come to their Schooles,) show'hem the use of Guns. And there instruct the noble English heires In Politique, and Militar Affaires; But he that should perswade, to have this done For education of our Lordings; Soone Should he heare of billow, wind, and storme, From the Tempestuous Grandlings, who'll informe Us, in our bearing, that are thus, and thus, Borne, bred, allied? what's he dare tutor us? Are we by Booke-wormes to be awde? must we Live by their Scale, that dare doe nothing free? Why are we rich, or great, except to show All licence in our lives? What need we know? More then to praise a Dog? or Horse? or speake The Hawking language? or our Day to breake With Citizens? let Clownes; and Tradesmen breed Their Sonnes to studie Arts, the Lawes, the Creed: We will beleeve like men of our owne Ranke, In so much land a yeare, or such a Banke, That turnes us so much moneys, at which rate Our Ancestors impos'd on Prince and State. Let poore Nobilitie be vertuous: Wee, Descended in a rope of Titles, be From Guy, or Bevis, Arthur, or from whom The Herald will. Our blood is now become, Past any need of vertue. Let them care, That in the Cradle of their Gentrie are; To serve the State by Councels, and by Armes: We neither love the Troubles, nor the harmes. What love you then? your whore? what study? gate, Carriage, and dressing. There is up of late? The Academie, where the Gallants meetâ What to make legs? yes, and to smell most sweet, All that they doe at Playes. O, but first here They learne and studie; and then practise there. But why are all these Irons i'the fire Of severall makings? helps, helps, t' attire His Lordship. That is for his Band, his haire This, and that box his Beautie to repaire; This other for his eye-browes; hence, away, I may no longer on these pictures stay, These Carkasses of honour; Taylors blocks, Cover'd with Tissue, whose prosperitie mocks The fate of things: whilst totter'd vertue holds Her broken Armes up, to their emptie moulds. An Epistle to Master Arth: Squib. What I am not, and what I faine would be, Whilst I informe my selfe, I would teach thee, My gentle Arthur; that it might be said One lesson we have both learn'd, and well read; I neither am, nor art thou one of those That hearkens to a Jacks-pulse, when it goes. Nor ever trusted to that friendship yet Was issue of the Taverne, or the Spit: Much lesse a name would we bring up, or nurse, That could but claime a kindred from the purse. Those are poore Ties, depend on those false ends, 'Tis vertue alone, or nothing that knits friends: And as within your Office, you doe take No piece of money, but you know, or make Inquirie of the worth: So must we doe, First weigh a friend, then touch, and trie him too: For there are many slips, and Counterfeits. Deceit is fruitfull. Men have Masques and nets, But these with wearing will themselves unfold: They cannot last. No lie grew ever old. Turne him, and see his Threds: looke, if he be Friend to himselfe, that would be friend to thee. For that is first requir'd, A man be his owne. But he that's too-much that, is friend of none. Then rest, and a friends value understand It is a richer Purchase then of land. An Epigram on Sir Edward Coke, when he was Lord chiefe Iustice of England. He that should search all Glories of the Gowne, And steps of all rais'd servants of the Crowne He could not find, then thee of all that store Whom Fortune aided lesse, or vertue more, Such, Coke, were thy beginnings, when thy good In others evill best was understood: When, being the Strangers helpe, the poore man aide, Thy just defences made th'oppressor afraid. Such was thy Processe, when Integritie, And skill in thee, now, grew Authoritie; That Clients strove, in Question of the Lawes, More for thy Patronage, then for their Cause, And that thy strong and manly Eloquence Stood up thy Nations fame, her Crownes defence, And now such is thy stand; while thou dost deale Desired Justice to the publique Weale Like Solons selfe; explat'st the knottie Lawes With endlesse labours, whilst thy learning drawes No lesse of praise, then readers in all kinds Of worthiest knowledge, that can take mens minds. Such is thy All; that (as I sung before) None Fortune aided lesse, or Vertue more. Or if Chance must, to each man that doth rise Needs lend an aide, to thine she had her eyes. An Epistle answering to one that asked to be Sealed of the Tribe of Ben. Men that are safe, and sure, in all they doe, Care not what trials they are put unto; They meet the fire, the Test, as Martyrs would; And though Opinion stampe them, not are gold, I could say more of such, but that I flie To speake my selfe out too ambitiously, And shewing so weake an Act to vulgar eyes; Put conscience and my right to comprimise. Let those that meerely talke, and never thinke, That live in the wild Anarchie of Drinke Subject to quarrell only; or else such As make it their proficiencie, how much They'ave glutted in, and letcher'd out that weeke, That never yet did friend, or friendship seeke But for a Sealing: let these men protest. Or th'other on their borders, that will jeast On all Soules that are absent; even the dead Like flies, or wormes, which mans corrupt parts fed: That to speake well, thinke it above all sinne, Of any Companie but that they are in, Call every night to Supper, in these fitts, And are receiv'd for the Covey of Witts; That censure all the Towne, and all th'affaires, And know whose ignorance is more then theirs; Let these men have their wayes, and take their times To vent their Libels, and to issue rimes, I have no portion in them, nor their deale Of newes they get, to strew out the long meale, I studie other friendships, and more one, Then these can ever be; or else wish none. What is't to me whether the French Designe Be, or be not, to get the Val-telline? Or the States Ships sent forth belike to meet Some hopes of Spaine in their West-Indian Fleet? Whether the Dispensation yet be sent, Or that the Match from Spaine was ever meant? I wish all well, and pray high heaven conspire My Princes safetie, and my Kings desire, But if for honour, we must draw the Sword, And force back that, which will not be restor'd, I have a body, yet, that spirit drawes To live, or fall, a Carkasse in the cause. So farre without inquirie what the States, Brunsfield, and Mansfield doe this yeare, my fates Shall carry me at Call; and I'le be well, Though I doe neither heare these newes, nor tell Of Spaine or France; or were not prick'd downe one Of the late Mysterie of reception, Although my Fame, to his, not under-heares, That guides the Motions, and directs the beares. But that's a blow, by which in time I may Lose all my credit with my Christmas Clay, And animated Porc'lane of the Court, I, and for this neglect, the courser sort Of earthen Jarres, there may molest me too: Well, with mine owne fraile Pitcher, what to doe I have decreed; keepe it from waves, and presse; Lest it be justled, crack'd made nought, or lesse: Live to that point I will, for which I am man, And dwell as in my Center, as I can Still looking too, and ever loving heaven; With reverence using all the gifts then given. 'Mongst which, if I have any friendships sent Such as are square, wel-tagde, and permanent, Not built with Canvasse, paper, and false lights As are the Glorious Scenes, at the great sights; And that there be no fev'ry heats, nor colds, Oylie Expansions, or shrunke durtie folds, But all so cleare, and led by reasons flame, As but to stumble in her sight were shame. These I will honour, love, embrace, and serve: And free it from all question to preserve. So short you read my Character, and theirs I would call mine, to which not many Staires Are asked to climbe. First give me faith, who know My selfe a little. I will take you so, As you have writ your selfe. Now stand, and then Sir, you are Sealed of the Tribe of Ben. The Dedication of the Kings new Cellar. To Bacchus. Since, Bacchus, thou art father Of Wines, to thee the rather We dedicate this Cellar, Where new, thou art made Dweller; And seale thee thy Commission: But 'tis with a condition, That thou remaine here taster Of all to the great Master. And looke unto their faces, Their Qualities, and races, That both, their odour take him, And relish merry make him. For Bacchus thou art freer Of cares, and over-seer, Of feast, and merry meeting, And still begin'st the greeting: See then thou dost attend him LyÅus, and defend him, By all the Arts of Gladnesse From any thought like sadnesse. So mayst thou still be younger Then PhÅbus; and much stronger To give mankind their eases, And cure the Worlds diseases: So may the Muses follow Thee still, and leave Apollo And thinke thy streame more quicker Then Hippocrenes liquor: And thou make many a Poet, Before his braine doe know it; So may there never Quarrell Have issue from the Barrell; But Venus and the Graces Pursue thee in all places, And not a Song be other Then Cupid, and his Mother. That when King James, above here Shall feast it, thou maist love there The causes and the Guests too, And have thy tales and jests too, Thy Circuits, and thy Rounds free As shall the feasts faire grounds be. Be it he hold Communion In great Saint Georges Union; Or gratulates the passage Of some wel-wrought Embassage: Whereby he may knit sure up The wished Peace of Europe: Or else a health advances, To put his Court in dances, And set us all on skipping, When with his royall shipping The narrow Seas are shadie, And Charles brings home the Ladie. Accessit fervor Capiti, Numerus? Lucernis. An Epigram on The Court Pucell. Do's the Court-Pucell then so censure me, And thinkes I dare not her? let the world see. What though her Chamber be the very pit Where fight the prime Cocks of the Game, for wit? And that as any are strooke, her breath creates New in their stead, out of the Candidates? What though with Tribade lust she force a Muse, And in an EpicÃ¦ne fury can write newes Equall with that, which for the best newes goes As aÃ«rie light, and as like wit as those? What though she talke, and cannot once with them, Make State, Religion, Bawdrie, all a theame. And as lip-thirstie, in each words expence, Doth labour with the Phrase more then the sense? What though she ride two mile on Holy-dayes To Church, as others doe to Feasts and Playes, To shew their Tires? to view, and to be view'd? What though she be with Velvet gownes indu'd, And spangled Petticotes brought forth to eye, As new rewards of her old secrecie! What though she hath won on Trust, as many doe, And that her truster feares her? Must I too? I never stood for any place: my wit Thinkes it selfe nought, though she should valew it. I am no States-man, and much lesse Divine For bawdry, 'tis her language, and not mine. Farthest I am from the Idolatrie To stuffes and Laces, those my Man can buy. And trust her I would least, that hath forswore In Contract twice, what can shee perjure more? Indeed, her Dressing some man might delight, Here face there's none can like by Candle light. Not he, that should the body have, for Case To his poore Instrument, now out of grace. Shall I advise thee Pucell? steale away From Court, while yet thy fame hath some small day; The wits will leave you, if they once perceive You cling to Lords, and Lords, if them you leave For Sermoneeres: of which now one, now other, They say you weekly invite with fits o'th'Mother, And practise for a Miracle; take heed This Age would lend no faith to Dorrels Deed; Or if it would, the Court is the worst place, Both for the Mothers, and the Babes of grace, For there the wicked in the Chaire of scorne, Will cal't a Bastard, when a Prophet's borne. An Epigram. To the honour'd ? Countesse of ? The Wisdome Madam of your private Life, Where with this while you live a widowed wife, And the right wayes you take unto the right, To conquer rumour, and triumph on spight; Not only shunning by your act, to doe Ought that is ill, but the suspition too, Is of so brave example, as he were No friend to vertue, could be silent here. The rather when the vices of the Time Are growne so fruitfull, and false pleasures climbe By all oblique Degrees, that killing height From whence they fall, cast downe with their owne weight. And though all praise bring nothing to your name, Who (herein studying conscience, and not fame) Are in your selfe rewarded; yet't will be A cheerefull worke to all good eyes, to see Among the daily Ruines that fall foule, Of State, of fame, of body, and of soule, So great a Vertue stand upright to view, As makes Penelopes old fable true, Whilst your Ulisses hath ta'ne leave to goe, Countries, and Climes manners, and men to know. Only your time you better entertaine, Then the great Homers wit, for her, could faine; For you admit no companie, but good, And when you want those friends, or neere in blood, Or your Allies, you make your bookes your friends, And studie them unto the noblest ends, Searching for knowledge, and to keepe your mind The same it was inspir'd, rich, and refin'd. These Graces, when the rest of Ladyes view Not boasted in your life, but practis'd true, As they are hard, for them to make their owne, So are they profitable to be knowne: For when they find so many meet in one, It will be shame for them, if they have none. Lord Bacons Birth-day. Haile happie Genius of this antient pile! How comes it all things so about the smile? The fire, the wine, the men! and in the midst, Thou stand'st as if some Mysterie thou did'st! Pardon, I read it in thy face, the day For whose returnes, and many, all these pray: And so doe I. This is the sixtieth yeare Since Bacon, and thy Lord was borne, and here; Sonne to the grave wise Keeper of the Seale, Fame, and foundation of the English Weale. What then his Father was, that since is hee, Now with a Title more to the Degree; Englands high Chancellor: the destin'd heire In his soft Cradle to his Fathers Chaire, Whose even Thred the Fates spinne round, and full, Out of their Choysest, and their whitest wooll. 'Tis a brave cause of joy, let it be knowne, For 't were a narrow gladnesse, kept thine owne. Give me a deep-crown'd-Bowle, that I may sing In raysing him the wisdome of my King. A PoÃ«me sent me by Sir William Burlase. The Painter to the Poet. To paint thy Worth, if rightly I did know it, And were but Painter halfe like thee, a PoÃ«t; Ben, I would show it: But in this skill, m'unskilfull pen will tire, Thou, and thy worth, will still be found farre higher; And I a Lier. Then, what a Painter's here? or what an eater Of great attempts! when as his skil's no greater, And he a Cheater? Then what a Poet's here! whom, by Confession Of all with me, to paint without Digression There's no Expression. My Answer. The Poet to the Painter. Why? though I seeme of a prodigious wast, I am not so voluminous, and vast, But there are lines, wherewith I might b'embrac'd. 'Tis true, as my wombe swells, so my backe stoupes, And the whole lumpe growes round, deform'd, and droupes, But yet the Tun at Heidelberg had houpes. You were not tied, by any Painters Law To square my Circle, I confesse; but draw My Superficies: that was all you saw. Which if in compasse of no Art it came To be described by a Monogram, With one great blot, yo'had form'd me as I am. But whilst you curious were to have it be An Archetipe, for all the world to see, You made it a brave piece, but not like me. O, had I now your manner, maistry, might, Your Power of handling, shadow, ayre, and spright, How I would draw, and take hold and delight. Put, you are he can paint; I can but write: A Poet hath no more but black and white, Ne knowes he flatt'ring Colours, or false light. Yet when of friendship I would draw the face A letter'd mind, and a large heart would place To all posteritie; I will write Burlase. An Epigram. To, William, Earle of Newcastle. When first my Lord, I saw you backe your horse, Provoke his mettall, and command his force To all the uses of the field, and race, Me thought I read the ancient Art of Thrace, And saw a Centaure, past those tales of Greece, So seem'd your horse; and you both of a peece! You shew'd like Perseus upon Pegasus; Or Castor mounted on his Cyllarus: Or what we heare our home-borne Legend tell, Of bold Sir Bevis, and his Arundell: Nay, so your Seate his beauties did endorse, As I began to wish my selfe a horse: And surely had I but your Stable seene Before: I thinke my wish absolv'd had beene. For never saw I yet the Muses dwell, Nor any of their houshold halfe so well. So well! as when I saw the floore, and Roome I look'd for Hercules to be the Groome: And cri'd, away, with the CÃ¦sarian bread, At these Immortall Mangers Virgil fed. Epistle To M?. Arthur Squib. I Am to dine, Friend, where I must be weigh'd For a just wager, and that wager paid If I doe lose it: And, without a Tale A Merchants Wife is Regent of the Scale. Who when shee heard the match, concluded streight, An ill commoditie! 'Tmust make good weight. So that upon the point, my corporall feare Is, she will play Dame Justice, too severe; And hold me to it close; to stand upright Within the ballance; and not want a mite; But rather with advantage to be found Full twentie stone; of which I lack two pound: That's six in silver; now within the Socket Stinketh my credit, if into the Pocket It doe not come: One piece I have in store, Lend me, deare Arthur, for a weeke five more, And you shall make me good, in weight, and fashion, And then to be return'd; or protestation To goe out afterâtill when take this letter For your securitie. I can no better. To M?. Iohn Burges. Would God my Burges, I could thinke Thoughts worthy of thy gift, this Inke, Then would I promise here to give Verse, that should thee, and me out-live. But since the Wine hath steep'd my braine I only can the Paper staine; Yet with a Dye, that feares no Moth, But Scarlet-like out-lasts the Cloth. Epistle. To my Lady Covell. You won not Verses, Madam, you won mee, When you would play so nobly, and so free. A booke to a few lynes: but, it was fit You won them too, your oddes did merit it, So have you gain'd a Servant, and a Muse: The first of which I feare, you will refuse; And you may justly, being a tardie cold, Unprofitable Chattell, fat and old, Laden with Bellie, and doth hardly approach His friends, but to breake Chaires, or cracke a Coach. His weight is twenty Stone within two pound; And that's made up as doth the purse abound. Marrie the Muse is one, can tread the Aire, And stroke the water, nimble, chast, and faire, Sleepe in a Virgins bosome without feare, Run all the Rounds in a soft Ladyes eare, Widow or Wife, without the jealousie Of either Suitor, or a Servant by. Such, (if her manners like you) I doe send: And can for other Graces her commend, To make you merry on the Dressing stoole, A mornings, and at afternoones, to foole Away ill company, and helpe in rime, Your Joane to passe her melancholie time. By this, although you fancie not the man Accept his Muse; and tell, I know you can: How many verses, Madam, are your Due! I can lose none in tendring these to you. I gaine, in having leave to keepe my Day, And should grow rich, had I much more to pay. To Master Iohn Burges. Father John Burges, Necessitie urges My wofull crie, To Sir Robert Pie: And that he will venter To send my Debentur. Tell him his Ben Knew the time, when He lov'd the Muses; Though now he refuses, To take Apprehension Of a yeares Pension, And more is behind: Put him in mind Christmas is neere; And neither good Cheare, Mirth, fooling, nor wit, Nor any least fit Of gambol, or sport Will come at the Court, If there be no money, No Plover, or Coney Will come to the Table, Or Wine to enable The Muse, or the Poet, The Parish will know it. Nor any quick-warming-pan helpe him to bed, If the 'Chequer be emptie, so will be his Head. Epigram, to my Book-seller. Thou, Friend, wilt heare all censures; unto thee All mouthes are open, and all stomacks free: Bee thou my Bookes intelligencer, note What each man sayes of it, and of what coat His judgement is? If he be wise, and praise, Thanke him: if other, hee can give no Bayes. If his wit reach no higher, but to spring Thy Wife a fit of laughter; a Cramp-ring Will be reward enough: to weare like those, That hang their richest jewells i'their nose; Like a rung Beare, or Swine: grunting out wit As if that part lay for a [?] most fit! If they goe on, and that thou lov'st a-life Their perfum'd judgements, let them kisse thy Wife. An Epigram. To William Earle of Newcastle. They talke of Fencing, and the use of Armes, The art of urging, and avoyding harmes, The noble Science, and the maistring skill Of making just approaches how to kill: To hit in angles, and to clash with time: As all defence, or offence were a chime! I hate such measur'd, give me mettall'd fire That trembles in the blaze, but (then) mounts higher! A quick, and dazeling motion! when a paire Of bodies, meet like rarified ayre! Their weapons shot out, with that flame, and force, As they out-did the lightning in the course; This were a spectacle! A sight to draw Wonder to Valour! No, it is the Law Of daring, not to doe a wrong, is true Valour! to sleight it, being done to you! To know the heads of danger! where 'tis fit To bend, to breake, provoke, or suffer it! All this (my Lord) is Valour! This is yours! And was your Fathers! All your Ancestours! Who durst live great, 'mongst all the colds, and heates, Of humane life! as all the frosts, and sweates Of fortune! when, or death appear'd, or bands! And valiant were, with, or without their hands. An Epitaph, on Henry L. La-ware. To the Passer-by. If, Passenger, thou canst but reade: Stay, drop a teare for him that's dead, Henry, the brave young Lord La-ware, Minerva's and the Muses care! What could their care doe 'gainst the spight Of a Disease, that lov'd no light Of honour, nor no ayre of good? But crept like darknesse through his blood? Offended with the dazeling flame Of Vertue, got above his name? No noble furniture of parts, No love of action, and high Arts. No aime at glorie, or in warre, Ambition to become a Starre, Could stop the malice of this ill, That spread his body o're, to kill: And only, his great Soule envy'd, Because it durst have noblier dy'd. An Epigram. [That you have seene the pride, beheld the sport] That you have seene the pride, beheld the sport, And all the games of Fortune, plaid at Court; View'd there the mercat, read the wretched rate At which there are, would sell the Prince, and State: That scarce you heare, a publike voyce alive, But whisper'd Counsells, and those only thrive; Yet are got off thence, with cleare mind, and hands To lift to heaven: who is't not understands Your happinesse, and doth not speake you blest, To see you set apart, thus, from the rest, T' obtaine of God, what all the Land should aske? A Nations sinne got pardon'd! 'twere a taske? Fit for a Bishops knees! O bow them oft, My Lord, till felt griefe make our stone hearts soft, And wee doe weepe, to water, for our sinne. He, that in such a flood, as we are in Of riot, and consumption knowes the way, To teach the people, how to fast, and pray, And doe their penance, to avert Gods rod, He is the Man, and Favorite of God. An Epigram. To K. Charles for a 100. pounds he sent me in my sicknesse. Great Charles, among the holy gifts of grace Annexed to thy Person, and thy place, 'Tis not enough (thy pietie is such) To cure the call'd Kings Evill with thy touch; But thou wilt yet a Kinglier mastrie trie, To cure the PoÃ«ts Evill, Povertie: And, in these Cures, do'st so thy selfe enlarge, As thou dost cure our Evill, at thy charge. Nay, and in this, thou show'st to value more One PoÃ«t, then of other folke ten score. O pietie! so to weigh the poores estates! O bountie! so to difference the rates! What can the PoÃ«t wish, his King may doe, But, that he cure the Peoples Evill too? To K Charles, and Q Mary. For the losse of their first-borne, An Epigram Consolatorie. Wao dares denie, that all first fruits are due To God, denies the God-head to be true: Who doubts, those fruits God can with gaine restore, Doth by his doubt, distrust his promise more. Hee can, he will, and with large int'rest pay, What (at his liking) he will take away. Then Royall Charles, and Mary, doe not grutch That the Almighties will to you is such: But thanke his greatnesse, and his goodnesse too; And thinke all still the best, that he will doe. That thought shall make, he will this losse supply With a long, large, and blest posteritie! For God, whose essence is so infinite, Cannot but heape that grace, he will requite. An Epigram. To our great and good K. Charles On his Anniversary Day. How happy were the Subject! if he knew Most pious King, but his owne good in you! How many times, live long, Charles, would he say, If he but weigh'd the blessings of this day? And as it turnes our joyfull yeare about, For safetie of such majestie, cry out? Indeed, when had great Brittaine greater cause Then now, to love the Soveraigne, and the Lawes? When you that raigne, are her Example growne, And what are bounds to her, you make your owne? When your assiduous practise doth secure That Faith, which she professeth to be pure? When all your life's a president of dayes, And murmure cannot quarrell at your wayes? How is she barren growne of love! or broke! That nothing can her gratitude provoke! O Times! O Manners! Surfet, bred of ease The truly Epidemicall disease! 'Tis not alone the Merchant, but the Clowne, Is Banke-rupt turn'd! the Cassock, Cloake, and Gowne, Are lost upon accompt! And none will know How much to heaven for thee, great Charles they owe! An Epigram on the Princes birth And art thou borne, brave Babe? Blest be thy birth? That so hath crown'd our hopes, our spring, and earth, The bed of the chast Lilly, and the Rose! What Month then May, was fitter to disclose This Prince of flowers? Soone shoot thou up, and grow The same that thou art promis'd, but be slow, And long in changing. Let our Nephewes see Thee, quickly the gardens eye to bee, And there to stand so. Hast, now envious Moone, And interpose thy selfe, ('care not how soone.) And threat' the great Eclipse. Two houres but runne, Sol will re-shine. If not, Charles hath a Sonne. ? Non displicuisse meretur Festinat CÃ¦sar qui placuisse tibi. An Epigram to the Queene, then lying in. Haile Mary, full of grace, it once was said, And by an Angell, to the blessed'st Maid The Mother of our Lord: why may not I (Without prophanenesse) yet, a PoÃ«t, cry Haile Mary, full of honours, to my Queene, The Mother of our Prince? When was there seene (Except the joy that the first Mary brought, Whereby the safetie of Man-kind was wrought.) So generall a gladnesse to an Isle! To make the hearts of a whole Nation smile, As in this Prince? Let it be lawfull, so To compare small with great, as still we owe Glorie to God. Then, Haile to Mary! spring Of so much safetie to the Realme, and King. An Ode, or Song, by all the Muses. In celebration of her Majesties birth-day. 1. Clio. Up publike joy, remember This sixteenth of November, Some brave un-common way: And though the Parish-steeple Be silent, to the people, Ring thou it Holy-day. 2. Mel. What, though the thriftie Tower And Gunnes there, spare to poure Their noises forth in Thunder: As fearfull to awake This Citie, or to shake Their guarded gates asunder? 3. Thal. Yet, let our Trumpets sound; And cleave both ayre and ground, With beating of our Drum's: Let every Lyre be strung, Harpe, Lute, Theorbo sprung, With touch of daintie thum's! 4. Evt. That when the Quire is full, The Harmony may pull The Angels from their Spheares: And each intelligence May wish it selfe a sense; Whilst it the Dittie heares. 5. Terp. Behold the royall Mary, The Daughtrr of great Harry! And Sister to just Lewis! Comes in the pompe, and glorie Of all her Brothers storie, And of her Fathers prowesse! 6. Erat. Shee showes so farre above The fained Queene of Love, This sea-girt Isle upon: As here no Venus were; But, that shee raigning here, Had got the Ceston on! 7. Calli. See, see our active King Hath taken twice the Ring Upon his pointed Lance: Whilst all the ravish'd rout Doe mingle in a shout, Hay! for the flowre of France! 8. Ura. This day the Court doth measure Her joy in state, and pleasure; And with a reverend feare, The Revells, and the Play, Summe up this crowned day, Her two and twenti'th yeare! 9. Poly. Sweet! happy Mary! All The People her doe call! And this the wombe divine! So fruitfull, and so faire, Hath brought the Land an Heire! And Charles a Caroline. An Epigram, To the House-hold. What can the cause be, when the K. hath given His PoÃ«t Sack, the House-hold will not pay? Are they so scanted in their store? or driven For want of knowing the PoÃ«t, to say him nay? Well, they should know him, would the K. but grant His PoÃ«t leave to sing his House-hold true; Hee'ld frame such ditties of their store, and want, Would make the very Greene-cloth to looke blew: And rather wish, in their expence of Sack, So, the allowance from the King to use, As the old Bard, should no Canary lack, 'Twere better spare a Butt, then spill his Muse. For in the Genius of a PoÃ«ts Verse, The Kings fame lives. Go now, denie his teirce. Epigram. To a Friend, and Sonne. Sonne, and my Friend, I had not call'd you so To mee; or beene the same to you; if show, Profit, or Chance had made us: But I know What, by that name, wee each to other owe, Freedome, and Truth; with love from those begot. Wise-crafts, on which the flatterer ventures not. His is more safe commoditie, or none: Nor dares he come in the comparison. But as the wretched Painter, who so ill Painted a Dog, that now his subtler skill Was, t'have a Boy stand with a Club, and fright All live dogs from the lane, and his shops sight. Till he had sold his Piece, drawne so unlike: So doth the flattrer, with farre cunning strike At a Friends freedome, proves all circling meanes To keepe him off; and how-so-e're he gleanes Some of his formes, he lets him not come neere Where he would fixe, for the distinctions feare. For as at distance, few have facultie To judge; So all men comming neere can spie, Though now of flattery, as of picture are More subtles workes, and finer pieces farre, Then knew the former ages: yet to life, All is but web, and painting; be the strife Never so great to get them: and the ends, Rather to boast rich hangings, then rare friends. To the immortall memorie, and friendship of that noble paire, Sir Lvcivs Cary, and Sir H. Morison. The Turne. Brave Infant of Saguntum, cleare Thy comming forth in that great yeare, When the Prodigious Hannibal did crowne His rage, with razing your immortall Towne. Thou, looking then about, E're thou wert halfe got out, Wise child, did'st hastily returne, And mad'st thy Mothers wombe thine urne. How summ'd a circle didst thou leave man-kind Of deepest lore, could we the Center find! The Counter-turne. Did wiser Nature draw thee back, From out the horrour of that sack, Where shame, faith, honour, and regard of right Lay trampled on; the deeds of death, and night, Urg'd, hurried forth, and horld Upon th'affrighted world: Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met; And all on utmost ruine set; As, could they but lifes miseries fore-see, No doubt all Infants would returne like thee? The Stand. For, what is life, if measur'd by the space, Not by the act? Or masked man, if valu'd by his face, Above his fact? Here's one out-liv'd his Peeres, And told forth fourescore yeares; He vexed time, and busied the whole State; Troubled both foes, and friends; But ever to no ends: What did this Stirrer, but die late? How well at twentie had he falne, or stood! For three of his foure-score, he did no good. The Turne. Hee entred well, by vertuous parts, Got up and thriv'd with honest arts: He purchas'd friends, and fame, and honours then, And had his noble name advanc'd with men: But weary of that flight, Hee stoop'd in all mens sight To sordid flatteries, acts of strife, And sunke in that dead sea of life So deep, as he did then death's waters sup; But that the Corke of Title boy'd him up. The Counter-turne. Alas, but Morison fell young: Hee never fell, thou fall'st my tongue. Hee stood, a Souldier to the last right end, A perfect Patriot, and a noble friend, But most a vertuous Sonne. All Offices were done By him, so ample, full, and round, In weight, in measure, number, sound, As though his age imperfect might appeare, His life was of Humanitie the Spheare. The Stand. Goe now, and tell out dayes summ'd up with feares, And make them yeares; Produce thy masse of miseries on the Stage, To swell thine age; Repeat of things a throng, To shew thou hast beene long, Not liv'd; for life doth her great actions spell, By what was done and wrought In season, and so brought To light: her measures are, how well Each syllab'e answer'd, and was form'd, how faire; These make the lines of life, and that's her ayre. The Turne. It is not growing like a tree In bulke, doth make man better bee; Or standing long an Oake, three hundred yeare, To fall a logge, at last, dry, bold, and seare: A Lillie of a Day, Is fairer farre, in May, Although it fall, and die that night; It was the Plant, and flowre of light. In small proportions, we just beauties see: And in short measures, life may perfect bee. The Counter-turne. Call, noble Lucius, then for Wine, And let thy lookes with gladnesse shine: Accept this garland, plant it on thy head, And thinke, nay know, thy Morison's not dead. Hee leap'd the present age, Possest with holy rage, To see that bright eternall Day: Of which we Priests, and PoÃ«ts say Such truths, as we expect for happy men, And there he lives with memorie; and Ben. The Stand. Johnson, who sung this of him, e're he went Himselfe to rest, Or taste a part of that full joy he meant To have exprest, In this bright Asterisme: Where it were friendships schisme, (Were not his Lucius Long with us to tarry) To separate these twi- Lights, the Dioscuri; And keepe the one halfe from his Harry. But fate doth so alternate the designe, Whilst that in heav'n, this light on earth must shine. The Turne. And shine as you exalted are; Two names of friendship, but one Starre: Of hearts the union. And those not by chance Made, or indenture, or leas'd out t'advance The profits for a time. No pleasures vaine did chime, Of rimes, or ryots, at your feasts, Orgies of drinke, or fain'd protests: But simple love of greatnesse, and of good; That knits brave minds, and manners, more then blood. The Counter-turne. This made you first to know the Why You lik'd, then after, to apply That liking; and approach so one the tother, Till either grew a portion of the other: Each stiled by his end, The Copie of his friend. You liv'd to be the great surnames, And titles, by which all made claimes Unto the Vertue. Nothing perfect done, But as a Cary, or a Morison. The Stand. And such a force the faire example had, As they that saw The good, and durst not practise it, were glad That such a Law Was left yet to Man-kind; Where they might read, and find Friendship, indeed, was written, not in words: And with the heart, not pen, Of two so early men, Whose lines her rowles were, and records. Who, e're the first downe bloomed on the chin, Had sow'd these fruits, and got the harvest in. To the Right Honourable, the Lord high Treasurer of England. An Epistle Mendicant. My Lord; 1631. Poore wretched states, prest by extremities, Are faine to seeke for succours, and supplies Of Princes aides, or good mens Charities. Disease, the Enemie, and his Ingineeres Want, with the rest of his conceal'd compeeres, Have cast a trench about mee, now five yeares. And made those strong approaches, by False braies, Reduicts, Halfe-moones, Horne-workes, and such close wayes, The Muse not peepes out, one of hundred dayes. But lyes block'd up, and straightned, narrow'd in, Fix'd to the bed, and boords, unlike to win Health, or scarce breath, as she had never bin. Unlesse some saving-Honour of the Crowne, Dare thinke it, to relieve, no lesse renowne, A Bed-rid Wit, then a besieged Towne. To the King. On his Birth-day. An Epigram Anniversarie. Novemb. 19 1632. This is King Charles his Day. Speake it thou Towre Unto the Ships, and they from tier, to tier, Discharge it 'bout the Iland, in an houre, As lowd as Thunder, and as swift as fire. Let Ireland meet it out at Sea, halfe way, Repeating all Great Brittain's joy, and more, Adding her owne glad accents, to this Day, Like Eccho playing from the other shore. What Drum's or Trumpets, or great Ord'nance can, The PoÃ«trie of Steeples, with the Bells, Three Kingdomes Mirth, in light, and aÃ«rie man, Made lighter with the Wine. All noises else, At Bonefires, Rockets, Fire-workes, with the Shoutes That cry that gladnesse, which their hearts would pray, Had they but grace, of thinking, at these routes, On th'often comming of this Holy-day: And ever close the burden of the Song, Still to have such a Charles, but this Charles long. The wish is great; but where the Prince is such, What prayers (People) can you thinke too much! On the Right Honourable, and vertuous Lord Weston, L. high Treasurer of England, Upon the Day, Hee was made Earle of Portland. To the Envious. 17. Febr. 1632. Looke up thou seed of envie, and still bring Thy faint, and narrow eyes, to reade the King In his great Actions: view whom his large hand, Hath rais'd to be the Port unto his Land! Weston! That waking man! that Eye of State! Who seldome sleepes! whom bad men only hate! Why doe I irritate, or stirre up thee, Thou sluggish spawne, that canst, but wilt not see! Feed on thy selfe for spight, and shew thy Kind: To vertue, and true worth, be ever blind. Dreame thou could'st hurt it, but before thou wake, T' effect it; Feele, thou 'ast made thine owne heart ake. To the Right hon??? Hierome, L. Weston. An Ode gratulatorie. For his Returne from his Embassie. 1632. Such pleasure as the teeming Earth, Doth take in easie Natures birth, When shee puts forth the life of ev'ry thing: And in a dew of sweetest Raine, Shee lies deliver'd without paine, Of the prime beautie of the yeare, the Spring. The Rivers in their shores doe run; The Clowdes rack cleare before the Sun, The rudest Winds obey the calmest Ayre: Rare Plants from ev'ry banke doe rise, And ev'ry Plant the sense surprize, Because the order of the whole is faire! The very verdure of her nest, Wherein she sits so richly drest, As all the wealth of Season, there was spread; Doth show, the Graces, and the Houres Have multipli'd their arts, and powers, In making soft her aromatique bed. Such joyes, such sweet's doth your Returne Bring all your friends, (faire Lord) that burne With love, to heare your modestie relate, The bus'nesse of your blooming wit, With all the fruit shall follow it, Both to the honour of the King and State. O how will then our Court be pleas'd, To see great Charles of Travaile eas'd, When he beholds a graft of his owne hand, Shoot up an Olive fruitfull, faire, To be a shadow to his Heire, And both a strength, and Beautie to his Land! EPITHALAMION; OR, A SONG: CELEBRATING THE NVPTIALS OF THAT NOBLE Gentleman, M?. Hierome Weston, Son, and Heire, of the Lord Weston, Lord high Treasurer of England, with the Lady Frances Stuart, Daughter of Esme D. of Lenox deceased, and Sister of the Surviving Duke of the same name. Though thou hast past thy Summer standing, stay A-while with us bright Sun, and helpe our light; Thou can'st not meet more Glory, on the way, Betweene thy Tropicks, to arrest thy sight, Then thou shalt see to day: We wooe thee, stay And see, what can be seene, The bountie of a King, and beautie of his Queene! See, the Procession! what a Holy day (Bearing the promise of some better fate) Hath filed, with Cacoches, all the way, From Greenwich, hither, to Row-hampton gate! When look'd the yeare, at best, So like a feast? Or were Affaires in tune, By all the Spheares consent, so in the heart of June? What Beautie of beauties, and bright youth's at charge Of Summers Liveries, and gladding greene; Doe boast their Loves, and Brav'ries so at large, As they came all to see, and to be seene! When look'd the Earth so fine, Or so did shine, In all her bloome, and flower; To welcome home a Paire, and deck the nuptiall bower? It is the kindly Season of the time, The Month of youth, which calls all Creatures forth To doe their Offices in Natures Chime, And celebrate (perfection at the worth) Mariage, the end of life, That holy strife, And the allowed warre: Through which not only we, but all our Species are. Harke how the Bells upon the waters play Their Sister-tunes, from Thames his either side, As they had learn'd new changes, for the day, And all did ring th'approches of the Bride; The Lady Frances, drest Above the rest Of all the Maidens faire; In gracefull Ornament of Garland, Gemmes, and Haire. See, how she paceth forth in Virgin-white, Like what she is, the Daughter of a Duke, And Sister: darting forth a dazling light On all that come her Simplesse to rebuke! Her tresses trim her back, As she did lack Nought of a Maiden Queene, With Modestie so crown'd, and Adoration seene. Stay, thou wilt see what rites the Virgins doe! The choisest Virgin-troup of all the Land! Porting the Ensignes of united Two, Both Crownes, and Kingdomes in their either hand; Whose Majesties appeare, To make more cleare This Feast, then can the Day Although that thou, O Sun, at our intreaty stay! See, how with Roses, and with Lillies shine, (Lillies and Roses, Flowers of either Sexe) The bright Brides paths, embelish'd more then thine With light of love, this Paire doth intertexe! Stay, see the Virgins sow, (Where she shall goe) The Emblemes of their way. O, now thou smil'st, faire Sun, and shin'st, as thou wouldst stay! With what full hands, and in how plenteous showers Have they bedew'd the Earth, where she doth tread, As if her ayrie steps did spring the flowers, And all the Ground, were Garden, where she led! See, at another doore, On the same floore, The Bridegroome meets the Bride With all the pompe of Youth, and all our Court beside. Our Court, and all the Grandees; now, Sun, looke, And looking with thy best Inquirie, tell, In all thy age of Journals thou hast tooke, Saw'st thou that Paire, became these Rites so well, Save the preceding Two? Who, in all they doe, Search, Sun, and thou wilt find They are th'exampled Paire, and mirrour of their kind. Force from the PhÅnix then, no raritie Of Sex, to rob the Creature; but from Man The king of Creatures; take his paritie With Angels, Muse, to speake these: Nothing can Illustrate these, but they Themselves to day, Who the whole Act expresse; All else we see beside, are Shadowes, and goe lesse. It is their Grace, and favour, that makes seene, And wonder'd at the bounties of this day: All is a story of the King and Queene! And what of Dignitie, and Honour may Be duly done to those Whom they have chose, And set the marke upon To give a greater Name, and Title to! Their owne! Weston, their Treasure, as their Treasurer, That Mine of Wisdome, and of Counsells deep, Great Say-Master of State, who cannot erre, But doth his Carract, and just Standard keepe In all the prov'd assayes, And legall wayes Of Tryals, to worke downe Mens Loves unto the Lawes, and Lawes to love the Crowne. And this well mov'd the Judgement of the King To pay with honours, to his noble Sonne To day, the Fathers service; who could bring Him up, to doe the same himselfe had done. That farre-all-seeing Eye Could soone espie What kind of waking Man He had so highly set; and, in what Barbican. Stand there; for when a noble Nature's rais'd, It brings Friends Joy, Foes Griefe, Posteritie Fame; In him the times, no lesse then Prince, are prais'd, And by his Rise, in active men, his Name Doth Emulation stirre; To th'dull, a Spur It is: to th'envious meant, A meere upbraiding Griefe, and tort'ring punishment. See, now the Chappell opens; where the King And Bishop stay, to consummate the Rites: The holy Prelate prayes, then takes the Ring, Askes first, Who gives her (I Charles) then he plights One in the others hand, Whilst they both stand Hearing their charge, and then The Solemne Quire cryes, Joy; and they returne, Amen. O happy bands! and thou more happy place, Which to this use, wer't built and consecrate! To have thy God to blesse, thy King to grace, And this their chosen Bishop celebrate; And knit the Nuptiall knot, Which Time shall not, Or canker'd Jealousie, With all corroding Arts, be able to untie! The Chappell empties, and thou may'st be gone Now, Sun, and post away the rest of day: These two, now holy Church hath made them one, Doe long to make themselves, so, another way: There is a Feast behind, to them of kind, Which their glad Parents taught One to the other, long e're these to light were brought. Haste, haste, officious Sun, and send them Night Some houres before it should, that these may know All that their Fathers, and their Mothers might Of Nuptiall Sweets, at such a season, owe, To propagate their Names, And keepe their Fames Alive, which else would die, For Fame keepes Vertue up, and it Posteritie. Th'Ignoble never liv'd, they were a-while Like Swine, or other Cattell here on earth: Their names are not recorded on the File Of Life, that fall so; Christians know their birth. Alone, and such a race, We pray may grace, Your fruitfull spreading Vine, But dare, not aske our wish in Language fescennine: Yet, as we may, we will, with chast desires, (The holy perfumes of the Mariage bed.) Be kept alive, those Sweet, and Sacred fires Of Love betweene you, and your Lovely-head: That when you both are old, You find no cold There; but, renewed, say, (After the last child borne;) This is our wedding day. Till you behold a race to fill your Hall, A Richard, and a Hierome, by their names Upon a Thomas, or a Francis call; A Kate, a Frank, to honour their Grand-dames, And 'tweene their Grandsires thighes, Like pretty Spies, Peepe forth a Gemme; to see How each one playes his part, of the large Pedigree. And never may there want one of the Stem, To be a watchfull Servant for this State; But like an Arme of Eminence 'mongst them, Extend a reaching vertue, early and late: Whilst the maine tree still found Upright and sound, By this Sun's Noone sted's made So great; his Body now alone projects the shade. They both are slip'd to Bed; Shut fast the Doore, And let him freely gather Loves First-fruits, Hee's Master of the Office; yet no more Exacts then she is pleas'd to pay: no suits Strifes, murmures, or delay, Will last till day; Night, and the sheetes will show, The longing Couple, all that elder Lovers know. The humble Petition of poore Ben. To th'best of Monarchs, Masters, Men, King CHARLES. âDoth most humbly show it, To your Majestie your PoÃ«t: That whereas your royall Father JAMES the blessed, pleas'd the rather, Of his speciall grace to Letters, To make all the MUSES debters To his bountie; by extension Of a free PoÃ«tique Pension, A large hundred Markes annuitie, To be given me in gratuitie For done service, and to come: And that this so accepted summe, Or dispenc'd in bookes, or bread, (For with both the MUSE was fed) Hath drawne on me, from the times, All the envie of the Rymes, And the ratling pit-pat-noyse, Of the lesse-PoÃ«tique boyes; When their pot-guns ayme to hit, With their pellets of small wit, Parts of me (they judg'd) decay'd, But we last out, still unlay'd. Please your Majestie to make Of your grace, for goodnesse sake, Those your Fathers Markes, your Pounds; Let their spite (which now abounds) Then goe on, and doe its worst; This would all their envie burst: And so warme the PoÃ«ts tongue You'ld reade a Snake, in his next Song. To the right Honourable, the Lord Treasurer of England. An Epigram. If to my mind, great Lord, I had a state, I would present you now with curious plate Of Noremberg, or Turkie; hang your roomes Not with the Arras, but the Persian Loomes. I would, if price, or prayer could them get, Send in, what or Romano, Tintaret, Titian, or Raphael, Michael Angelo Have left in fame to equall, or out-goe The old Greek-hands in picture, or in stone. This I would doe, could I know Weston, one Catch'd with these Arts, wherein the Judge is wise As farre as sense, and onely by the eyes. But you, I know, my Lord; and know you can Discerne betweene a Statue, and a Man; Can doe the things that Statues doe deserve, And act the businesse, which they paint, or carve. What you have studied are the arts of life; To compose men, and manners; stint the strife Of murmuring Subjects; make the Nations know What worlds of blessings to good Kings they owe: And mightiest Monarchs feele what large increase Of sweets, and safeties, they possesse by Peace. These I looke up at, with a reverent eye, And strike Religion in the standers-by; Which, though I cannot as an Architect In glorious Piles, or Pyramids erect Unto your honour: I can tune in song Aloud; and (happ'ly) it may last as long. An Epigram To my MUSE, the Lady Digby, on her Husband, Sir Kenelme Digby. Tho', happy Muse, thou know my Digby well; Yet read him in these lines: He doth excell In honour, courtesie, and all the parts Court can call hers, or Man could call his Arts. Hee's prudent, valiant, just, and temperate; In him all vertue is beheld in State: And he is built like some imperiall roome For that to dwell in, and be still at home. His brest is a brave Palace, a broad Street Where all heroique ample thoughts doe meet: Where Nature such a large survey hath ta'en, As other soules to his dwelt in a Lane: Witnesse his Action done at Scanderone; Upon my Birth-day the eleventh of June; When the Apostle Barnabee the bright Unto our yeare doth give the longest light, In signe the Subject, and the Song will live Which I have vow'd posteritie to give. Goe, Muse, in, and salute him. Say he be Busie, or frowne at first; when he sees thee, He will cleare up his forehead: thinke thou bring'st Good Omen to him, in the note thou sing'st, For he doth love my Verses, and will looke Upon them, (next to Spenser's noble booke.) And praise them too. O! what a fame 'twill be? What reputation to my lines, and me, When hee shall read them at the Treasurers bord? The knowing Weston, and that learned Lord Allowes them? Then, what copies shall be had, What transcripts begg'd? how cry'd up, and how glad, Wilt thou be, Muse, when this shall them befall? Being sent to one, they will be read of all.

Faire Friend, 't is true, your beauties move My heart to a respect: Too little to bee paid with love, Too great for your neglect. I neither love, nor yet am free, For though the flame I find Be not intense in the degree, 'T is of the purest kind. It little wants of love, but paine, Your beautie takes my sense, And lest you should that price disdaine, My thoughts, too, feele the influence. 'Tis not a passions first accesse Readie to multiply, But like Loves calmest State it is Possest with victorie. It is like Love to Truth reduc'd All the false value's gone, Which were created, and induc'd By fond imagination. 'T is either Fancie, or 't is Fate, To love you more then I; I love you at your beauties rate, Lesse were an Injurie. Like unstamp'd Gold, I weigh each grace, So that you may collect, Th' intrinsique value of your face, Safely from my respect. And this respect would merit love, Were not so faire a sight Payment enough; for, who dare move Reward for his delight? On the Kings Birth-day. Rowse up thy selfe, my gentle Muse, Though now our greene conceits be gray, And yet once more doe not refuse To take thy Phrygian Harp, and play In honour of this cheerefull Day: Long may they both contend to prove, That best of Crownes is such a love. Make first a Song of Joy, and Love, Which chastly flames in royall eyes, Then tune it to the Spheares above, When the benignest Stars doe rise, And sweet Conjunctions grace the skies. Long may, &amp;c. To this let all good hearts resound, Whilst Diadems invest his head; Long may he live, whose life doth bound More then his Lawes, and better led By high Example, then by dread. Long may, &amp;c. Long may he round about him see His Roses, and his Lillies blowne: Long may his only Deare, and Hee Joy in IdÃ¦as of their owne, And Kingdomes hopes so timely sowne.

At land she triumphs in the triple shade, Her Rose, and Lilly, intertwind, have made. Oceano secura meo, securior umbris. An Elegie On the Lady Anne Pavvlet, Marchion: of Winton. What gentle Ghost, besprent with April deaw, Hayles me, so solemnly, to yonder Yewgh? And beckning wooes me, from the fatall tree To pluck a Garland, for her selfe, or mee? I doe obey you, Beautie! for in death, You seeme a faire one! O that you had breath, To give your shade a name! Stay, stay, I feele A horrour in mee! all my blood is steele! Stiffe! starke! my joynts 'gainst one another knock! Whose Daughter? ha? Great Savage of the Rock? Hee's good, as great. I am almost a stone! And e're I can aske more of her shee's gone! Alas, I am all Marble! write the rest Thou wouldst have written, Fame, upon my brest: It is a large faire table, and a true, And the disposure will be something new, When I, who would the PoÃ«t have become, At least may beare th'inscription to her Tombe. Shee was the Lady Jane, and Marchionisse Of Winchester; the Heralds can tell this. Earle Rivers Grand-Childâserve not formes, good Fame, Sound thou her Vertues, give her soule a Name. Had I a thousand Mouthes, as many Tongues, And voyce to raise them from my brazen Lungs, I durst not aime at that: The dotes were such Thereof, no notion can expresse how much Their Carract was! I, or my trump must breake, But rather I, should I of that part speake! It is too neere of kin to Heaven, the Soule, To be describ'd! Fames fingers are too foule To touch these Mysteries! We may admire The blaze, and splendor, but not handle fire! What she did here, by great example, well, t'inlive posteritie, her Fame may tell! And, calling truth to witnesse, make that good From the inherent Graces in her blood! Else, who doth praise a person by a new, But a fain'd way, doth rob it of the true. Her Sweetnesse, Softnesse, her faire Courtesie, Her wary guardes, her wise simplicitie, Were like a ring of Vertues, 'bout her set, And pietie the Center, where all met. A reverend State she had, an awfull Eye, A dazling, yet inviting, Majestie: What Nature, Fortune, Institution, Fact Could summe to a perfection, was her Act! How did she leave the world? with what contempt? Just as she in it liv'd! and so exempt From all affection! when they urg'd the Cure Of her disease, how did her soule assure Her suffrings, as the body had beene away! And to the Torturers (her Doctors) say, Stick on your Cupping-glasses, feare not, put Your hottest Causticks to, burne, lance, or cut: 'Tis but a body which you can torment, And I, into the world, all Soule, was sent! Then comforted her Lord! and blest her Sonne! Chear'd her faire Sisters in her race to runne! With gladnesse temper'd her sad Parents teares! Made her friends joyes, to get above their feares! And, in her last act, taught the Standers-by, With admiration, and applause to die! Let Angels sing her glories, who did call Her spirit home, to her originall! Who saw the way was made it! and were sent To carry, and conduct the Complement 'Twixt death and life! Where her mortalitie Became her Birth-day to Eternitie! And now, through circumfused light, she lookes On Natures secrets, there, as her owne bookes: Speakes Heavens Language! and discovereth free To every Order, ev'ry Hierarchie! Beholds her Maker! and, in him, doth see What the beginnings of all beauties be; And all beatitudes, that thence doe flow: Which they that have the Crowne are sure to know! Goe now, her happy Parents, and be sad If you not understand, what Child you had. If you dare grudge at Heaven, and repent T'have paid againe a blessing was but lent, And trusted so, as it deposited lay At pleasure, to be call'd for, every day! If you can envie your owne Daughters blisse, And wish her state lesse happie then it is! If you can cast about your either eye, And see all dead here, or about to dye! The Starres, that are the Jewels of the Night, And Day, deceasing! with the Prince of light, The Sunne! great Kings! and mightiest Kingdomes fall! Whole Nations! nay Mankind! the World, with all That ever had beginning there, to'ave end! With what injustice should one soule pretend T' escape this common knowne necessitie, When we were all borne, we began to die; And, but for that Contention, and brave strife The Christian hath t'enjoy the future life, Hee were the wretched'st of the race of men: But as he soares at that, he bruiseth then The Serpents head: Gets above Death, and Sinne, And, sure of Heaven, rides triumphing in. EUPHEME; OR, THE FAIRE FAME. LEFT TO POSTERITIE Of that truly-noble Lady, the Lady VENETIA DIGBY, late Wife of Sir KENELME DIGBY, Knight: A Gentleman absolute in all Numbers; Consisting of these Ten Pieces. The Dedication of her CRADLE. The Song of her DESCENT. The Picture of her BODY. Her MIND. Her being chosen a MUSE. Her faire OFFICES. Her happie MATCH. Her hopefull ISSUE. Her ?????????, or Relation to the Saints. Her Inscription, or CROWNE. Vivam amare voluptas, defunctam Religio. Stat. 1. The Dedication of her CRADLE. Faire FAME, who art ordain'd to crowne With ever-greene, and great renowne, Their Heads, that ENVY would hold downe With her, in shade Of Death, and Darknesse; and deprive Their names of being kept alive, By THEE, and CONSCIENCE, both who thrive By the just trade Of Goodnesse still: Vouchsafe to take This CRADLE, and for Goodnesse sake, A dedicated Ensigne make Thereof, to TIME. That all Posteritie, as wee, Who read what the CREPUNDIA bee, May something by that twilight see 'Bove rattling Rime. For, though that Rattles, Timbrels, Toyes, Take little Infants with their noyse, As prop'rest gifts, to Girles, and Boyes Of light expence; Their Corrals, Whistles, and prime Coates, Their painted Maskes, their paper Boates, With Sayles of silke, as the first notes Surprize their sense: Yet, here are no such Trifles brought, No cobweb Call's; no Surcoates wrought With Gold, or Claspes, which might be bought On every Stall. But, here's a Song of her DESCENT; And Call to the high Parliament Of Heaven; where SERAPHIM take tent Of ord'ring all. This, utter'd by an antient BARD, Who claimes (of reverence) to be heard, As comming with his Harpe, prepar'd To chant her 'gree, Is sung: as als' her getting up By JACOBS Ladder, to the top Of that eternall Port kept ope' For such as SHEE. 2. The Song of her DESCENT. I Sing the just, and uncontrol'd Descent Of Dame VENETIA DIGBY, styl'd The Faire: For Mind, and Body, the most excellent That ever Nature, or the later Ayre Gave two such Houses as NORTHUMBERLAND, And STANLEY, to the which shee was Co-heire. Speake it, you bold PENATES, you that stand At either Stemme, and know the veines of good Run from your rootes; Tell, testifie the grand Meeting of Graces, that so swell'd the flood Of vertues in her, as, in short, shee grew The wonder of her Sexe, and of your Blood. And tell thou, ALDE-LEGH, None can tell more true Thy Neeces line, then thou that gav'st thy Name Into the Kindred, whence thy Adam drew Meschines honour with the Cestrian fame Of the first Lupus, to the Familie By Ranulph The rest of this Song is lost. 3. The Picture of the BODY. Sitting, and ready to be drawne, What makes these Velvets, Silkes, and Lawne, Embroderies, Feathers, Fringes, Lace, Where every lim takes like a face? Send these suspected helpes, to aide Some Forme defective, or decay'd; This beautie without falshood fayre, Needs nought to cloath it but the ayre. Yet something, to the Painters view, Were fitly interpos'd; so new: Hee shall, if he can understand, Worke with my fancie, his owne hand. Draw first a Cloud: all save her neck; And, out of that, make Day to breake; Till, like her face, it doe appeare, And Men may thinke, all light rose there. Then let the beames of that, disperse The Cloud, and show the Universe; But at such distance, as the eye May rather yet adore, then spy. The Heaven design'd, draw next a Spring, With all that Youth, or it can bring: Foure Rivers branching forth like Seas, And Paradise confining these. Last, draw the circles of this Globe, And let there be a starry Robe Of Constellations 'bout her horld; And thou hast painted beauties world. But, Painter, see thou doe not sell A Copie of this peece; nor tell Whose 'tis: but if it favour find, Next sitting we will draw her mind. 4. The MIND. Painter yo' are come, but may be gone, Now I have better thought thereon, This worke I can performe alone; And give you reasons more then one. Not, that your Art I doe refuse: But here I may no colours use. Beside, your hand will never hit, To draw a thing that cannot sit. You could make shift to paint an Eye, An Eagle towring in the skye, The Sunne, a Sea, or soundlesse Pit; But these are like a Mind, not it. No, to expresse a Mind to sense, Would aske a Heavens Intelligence; Since nothing can report that flame, But what's of kinne to whence it came. Sweet Mind, then speake your selfe, and say, As you goe on, by what brave way Our sense you doe with knowledge fill, And yet remaine our wonder still. I call you Muse; now make it true: Hence-forth may every line be you; That all may say, that see the frame, This is no Picture, but the same. A Mind so pure, so perfect fine, As 'tis not radiant, but divine: And so disdaining any tryer; 'Tis got where it can try the fire. There, high exalted in the Spheare, As it another Nature were, It moveth all; and makes a flight As circular, as infinite. Whose Notions when it will expresse In speech; it is with that excesse Of grace, and Musique to the eare, As what it spoke, it planted there. The Voyce so sweet, the words so faire, As some soft chime had stroak'd the ayre; And, though the sound were parted thence, Still left an Eccho in the sense. But, that a Mind so rapt, so high, So swift, so pure, should yet apply It selfe to us, and come so nigh Earths grossnesse; There's the how, and why. Is it because it sees us dull, And stuck in clay here, it would pull Us forth, by some Celestiall slight Up to her owne sublimed hight? Or hath she here, upon the ground, Some Paradise, or Palace found In all the bounds of beautie fit For her t'inhabit? There is it. Thrice happy house, that hast receipt For this so loftie forme, so streight, So polisht, perfect, round, and even, As it slid moulded off from Heaven. Not swelling like the Ocean proud, But stooping gently, as a Cloud, As smooth as Oyle pour'd forth, and calme As showers; and sweet as drops of Balme. Smooth, soft, and sweet, in all a floud Where it may run to any good; And where it stayes, it there becomes A nest of odorous spice, and gummes. In action, winged as the wind, In rest, like spirits left behind Upon a banke, or field of flowers, Begotten by that wind, and showers. In thee, faire Mansion, let it rest, Yet know, with what thou art possest, Thou entertaining in thy brest, But such a Mind, mak'st God thy Guest. A whole quaternion in the middest of this Poem is lost, containing entirely the three next pieces of it, and all of the fourth (which in the order of the whole, is the eighth) excepting the very end: which at the top of the next quaternion goeth on thus: But, for you (growing Gentlemen) the happy branches of two so illustrious Houses as these, where from your honour'd Mother, is in both lines descended; let me leave you this last Legacie of Counsell; which so soone as you arrive at yeares of mature Understanding, open you (Sir) that are the eldest, and read it to your Brethren, for it will concerne you all alike. Vowed by a faithfull Servant, and Client of your Familie, with his latest breath expiring it B. I. To Kenelme, Iohn, George. Boast not these Titles of your Ancestors; (Brave Youths) th'are their possessions, none of yours: When your owne Vertues, equall'd have their Names, 'Twill be but faire, to leane upon their Fames; For they are strong Supporters: But, till then, The greatest are but growing Gentlemen. It is a wretched thing to trust to reedes; Which all men doe, that urge not their owne deeds Up to their Ancestors; the rivers side, By which yo'are planted, shew's your fruit shall bide: Hang all your roomes, with one large Pedigree: 'Tis Vertue alone, is true Nobilitie. Which Vertue from your Father, ripe, will fall; Study illustrious Him, and you have all. 9. Elegie on my Muse. The truly honoured Lady, the Lady Venetia Digby; who living, gave me leave to call her so. Being Her ?????????, or Relation to the Saints. Sera quidem tanto struitur medicina dolori. An Elegie on my Muse. 'Twere time that I ty'd too, now shee is dead, Who was my Muse, and life of all I dy'd. The Spirit that I wrote with, and conceiv'd, All that was good, or great in me she weav'd, And set it forth; the rest were Cobwebs fine, Spun out in name of some of the old Nine! To hang a window, or make darke the roome, Till swept away, th'were cancell'd with a broome! Nothing, that could remaine, or yet can stirre A sorrow in me, fit to wait to her! O! had I seene her laid out a faite Corse, By Death, on Earth, I should have had remorse On Nature, for her: who did let her lie, And saw that portion of her selfe to die. Sleepie, or stupid Nature, couldst thou part With such a Raritie, and not rowse Art With all her aydes, to save her from the seize Of Vulture death, and those relentlesse cleies? Thou wouldst have lost the PhÅnix, had the kind Beene trusted to thee: not to't selfe assign'd. Looke on thy sloth, and give thy selfe undone, (For so thou art with me) now shee is gone. My wounded mind cannot sustaine this stroke, It rages, runs, flies, stands, and would provoke The world to ruine with it; in her Fall, I summe up mine owne breaking, and wish all. Thou hast no more blowes, Fate, to drive at one, What's left a PoÃ«t, when his Muse is gone? Sure, I am dead, and know it not! I feele Nothing I doe; but, like a heavie wheele, Am turned with an others powers. My Passion Whoorles me about, and to blaspheme in fashion! I murmure against God, for having ta'en Her blessed Soule, hence, forth this valley vane Of teares, and dungeon of calamitie! I envie it the Angels amitie! The joy of Saints! the Crowne for which it lives, The glorie, and gaine of rest, which the place gives! Dare I prophane, so irreligious bee To 'greet, or grieve her soft Euthanasee! So sweetly taken to the Court of blisse, As spirits had stolne her Spirit, in a kisse, From off her pillow, and deluded bed; And left her lovely body unthought dead! Indeed, she is not dead! but laid to sleepe In earth, till the last Trumpe awake the Sheepe And Goates together, whither they must come To heare their Judge, and his eternall doome. To have that finall retribution, Expected with the fleshes restitution. For, as there are three Natures, Schoolemen call One corporall, only; th'other spirituall, Like single; so, there is a third, commixt, Of Body and Spirit together, plac'd betwixt Those other two; which must be judg'd, or crown'd: This as it guilty is, or guiltlesse found, Must come to take a sentence, by the sense Of that great Evidence, the Conscience! Who will be there, against that day prepar'd, T'accuse, or quit all Parties to be heard! O Day of joy, and suretie to the just! Who in that feast of Resurrection trust! That great eternall Holy-day of rest, To Body, and Soule! where Love is all the guest! And the whole Banquet is full sight of God! Of joy the Circle, and sole Period! All other gladnesse, with the thought is barr'd; Hope, hath her end! and Faith hath her reward! This being thus: why should my tongue, or pen Presume to interpell that fulnesse, when Nothing can more adorne it, then the seat That she is in, or, make it more compleat? Better be dumbe, then superstitious! Who violates the God-head, is most vitious Against the Nature he would worship. Hee Will honour'd be in all simplicitie! Have all his actions, wondred at, and view'd With silence, and amazement! not with rude, Dull, and prophane, weake, and imperfect eyes, Have busie search made in his mysteries! Hee knowes, what worke h'hath done, to call this Guest, Out of her noble body, to this Feast: And give her place, according to her blood Amongst her Peeres, those Princes of all good! Saints, Martyrs, Prophets, with those Hierarchies, Angels, Arch-angels, Principalities, The Dominations, Vertues, and the Powers, The Thrones, the Cherube, and Seraphick bowers, That, planted round, there sing before the Lamb, A new Song to his praise, and great I AM: And she doth know, out of the shade of Death, What 'tis t'enjoy, an everlasting breath! To have her captiv'd spirit freed from flesh, And on her Innocence, a garment fresh And white, as that, put on: and in her hand With boughs of Palme, a crowned Victrice stand! And will you, worthy Sonne, Sir, knowing this, Put black, and mourning on? and say you misse A Wife, a Friend, a Lady, or a Love; Whom her Redeemer, honour'd hath above Her fellowes, with the oyle of gladnesse, bright In heaven Empyre, and with a robe of light? Thither, you hope to come; and there to find That pure, that pretious, and exalted mind You once enjoy'd: A short space severs yee, Compar'd unto that long eternitie, That shall re-joyne yee. Was she, then, so deare, When shee departed? you will meet her there, Much more desir'd, and dearer then before, By all the wealth of blessings, and the store Accumulated on her, by the Lord Of life, and light, the Sonne of God, the Word! There, all the happy soules, that ever were, Shall meet with gladnesse in one Theatre; And each shall know, there, one anothers face: By beatifick vertue of the Place. There shall the Brother, with the Sister walke, And Sons, and Daughters, with their Parents talke; But all of God; They still shall have to say, But make him All in All, their Theme, that Day: That happy Day, that never shall see night! Where Hee will be, all Beautie to the Sight; Wine, or delicious fruits, unto tee Taste; A Musique in the Eares, will ever last; Unto the Sent, a Spicerie, or Balme; And to the Touch, a Flower, like soft as Palme. Hee will all Glory, all Perfection be, God, in the Union, and the Trinitie! That holy, great, and glorious Mysterie, Will there revealed be in Majestie! By light, and comfort of spirituall Grace; The vision of our Saviour, face, to face In his humanitie! To heare him preach The price of our Redemption, and to teach Through his inherent righteousnesse, in death, The safetie of our soules, and forfeit breath! What fulnesse of beatitude is here? What love with mercy mixed doth appeare? To style us Friends, who were, by Nature, Foes? Adopt us Heires, by grace, who were of those Had lost our selves? and prodigally spent Our native portions, and possessed rent; Yet have all debts forgiven us, and advance B' imputed right to an inheritance In his eternall Kingdome, where we sit Equall with Angels, and Co-heires of it. Nor dare we under blasphemy conceive He that shall be our supreme Judge, should leave Himselfe so un-inform'd of his elect Who knowes the hearts of all, and can dissect The smallest Fibre of our flesh; he can Find all our Atomes from a point t'a span! Our closest Creekes, and Corners, and can trace Each line, as it were graphick, in the face. And best he knew her noble Character, For 'twas himselfe who form'd, and gave it her. And to that forme, lent two such veines of blood As nature could not more increase the flood Of title in her! All nobilitie (But pride, that schisme of incivilitie) She had, and it became her! she was fit T'have knowne no envy, but by suffring it! She had a mind as calme, as she was faire; Not tost or troubled with light Lady-aire; But, kept an even gate, as some streight tree Mov'd by the wind, so comely moved she. And by the awfull manage of her Eye She swaid all bus'nesse in the Familie! To one she said, Doe this, he did it; So To another, Move; he went; To a third, Go, He run; and all did strive with diligence T'obey, and serve her sweet Commandements. She was in one, a many parts of life; A tender Mother, a discreeter Wife, A solemne Mistresse, and so good a Friend, So charitable, to religious end In all her petite actions, so devote, As her whole life was now become one note Of Pietie, and private holinesse. She spent more time in teares her selfe to dresse For her devotions, and those sad essayes Of sorrow, then all pompe of gaudy daies: And came forth ever cheered, with the rod Of divine Comfort, when sh'had talk'd with God. Her broken sighes did never misse whole sense: Nor can the bruised heart want eloquence: For, Prayer is the Incense most perfumes The holy Altars, when it least presumes. And hers were all Humilitie! they beat The doore of Grace, and found the Mercy-Seat. In frequent speaking by the pious Psalmes Her solemne houres she spent, or giving Almes, Or doing other deeds of Charitie, To cloath the naked, feed the hungry. Shee Would sit in an Infirmer, whole dayes Poring, as on a Map, to find the wayes To that eternall Rest, where now sh'hath place By sure Election, and predestin'd grace! Shee saw her Saviour, by an early light, Incarnate in the Manger, shining bright On all the world! Shee saw him on the Crosse Suffring, and dying to redeeme our losse! Shee saw him rise, triumphing over Death To justifie, and quicken us in breath! Shee saw him too, in glory to ascend For his designed worke the perfect end Of raising, judging, and rewarding all The kind of Man, on whom his doome should fall! All this by Faith she saw, and fram'd a Plea, In manner of a daily Apostrophe, To him should be her Judge, true God, true Man, Jesus, the onely gotten Christ! who can As being Redeemer, and Repairer too (Of lapsed Nature) best know what to doe, In that great Act of judgement: which the Father Hath given wholly to the Sonne (the rather As being the Sonne of Man) to shew his Power, His Wisdome, and his Justice, in that houre, The last of houres, and shutter up of all; Where first his Power will appeare, by call Of all are dead to life! His Wisdome show In the discerning of each conscience, so! And most his Justice, in the fitting parts, And giving dues to all Mankinds deserts! In this sweet Extasie, she was rapt hence. Who reades, will pardon my Intelligence, That thus have ventur'd these true straines upon; To publish her a Saint. My Muse is gone. In pietatis memoriam quam prÃ¦stas VenetiÃ¦ tuÃ¦ illustrissim: Marit: dign: Digbeie Hanc ?????????, tibi, tuis? sacro. The Tenth, being her Inscription, or CROWNE, is lost. The praises of a Countrie life. Happie is he, that from all Businesse cleere, As the old race of Mankind were, With his owne Oxen tills his Sires left lands, And is not in the Usurers bands: Nor Souldier-like started with rough alarmes, Nor dreads the Seas inraged harmes: But flees the Barre and Courts, with the proud bords, And waiting Chambers of great Lords. The Poplar tall, he then doth marrying twine With the growne issue of the Vine; And with his hooke lops off the fruitlesse race, And sets more happy in the place: Or in the bending Vale beholds a-farre The lowing herds there grazing are: Or the prest honey in pure pots doth keepe Of Earth, and sheares the tender Sheepe: Or when that Autumne, through the fields lifts round His head, with mellow Apples crown'd, How plucking Peares, his owne hand grafted had, And purple-matching Grapes, hee's glad! With which, Priapus, he may thanke thy hands, And, Sylvane, thine that keptst his Lands! Then now beneath some ancient Oke he may Now in the rooted Grasse him lay, Whilst from the higher Bankes doe slide the floods? The soft birds quarrell in the Woods, The Fountaines murmure as the streames doe creepe, And all invite to easie sleepe. Then when the thundring Jove, his Snow and showres Are gathering by the Wintry houres; Or hence, or thence, he drives with many a Hound Wild Bores into his toyles pitch'd round: Or straines on his small forke his subtill nets For th'eating Thrush, or Pit-falls sets: And snares the fearfull Hare, and new-come Crane, And 'counts them sweet rewards so ta'en. Who (amongst these delights) would not forget Loves cares so evill, and so great? But if, to boot with these, a chaste Wife meet For houshold aid, and Children sweet; Such as the Sabines, or a Sun-burnt-blowse, Some lustie quick Apulians spouse, To deck the hallow'd Harth with old wood fir'd Against the Husband comes home tir'd; That penning the glad flock in hurdles by Their swelling udders doth draw dry: And from the sweet Tub Wine of this yeare takes, And unbought viands ready makes: Not Lucrine Oysters I could then more prize, Nor Turbot, nor bright Golden eyes: If with bright floods, the Winter troubled much, Into our Seas send any such: Th'Ionian God-wit, nor the Ginny hen Could not goe downe my belly then More sweet then Olives, that new gather'd be From fattest branches of the Tree: Or the herb Sorrell, that loves Meadows still, Or Mallowes loosing bodyes ill: Or at the Feast of Bounds, the Lambe then slaine, Or Kid forc't from the Wolfe againe. Among these Cates how glad the sight doth come Of the fed flocks approaching home! To view the weary Oxen draw, with bare And fainting necks, the turned Share! The wealthy houshold swarme of bondmen met, And 'bout the steeming Chimney set! These thoughts when Usurer Alphius, now about To turne more farmer, had spoke out 'Gainst th'Ides, his moneys he gets in with paine, At th'Calends, puts all out againe. Ode the first. The fourth Booke. To Venus. Venus againe thou mov'st a warre Long intermitted, pray thee, pray thee spare: I am not such, as in the Reigne Of the good Cynara I was: Refraine, Sower Mother of sweet Loves, forbeare To bend a man now at his fiftieth yeare Too stubborne for Commands, so slack: Goe where Youths soft intreaties call thee back. More timely hie thee to the house, With thy bright Swans of Paulus Maximus: There jest, and feast, make him thine host, If a fit livor thou dost seeke to toast; For he's both noble, lovely, young, And for the troubled Clyent fyl's his tongue, Child of a hundred Arts, and farre Will he display the Ensignes of thy warre. And when he smiling finds his Grace With thee 'bove all his Rivals gifts take place, He will thee a Marble Statue make Beneath a Sweet-wood Roofe, neere Alba Lake: There shall thy dainty Nostrill take In many a Gumme, and for thy soft eares sake Shall Verse be set to Harpe and Lute, And Phrygian Hau'boy, not without the Flute. There twice a day in sacred Laies, The Youths and tender Maids shall sing thy praise: And in the Salian manner meet Thrice 'bout thy Altar with their Ivory feet. Me now, nor Wench, nor wanton Boy, Delights, nor credulous hope of mutuall Joy, Nor care I now healths to propound; Or with fresh flowers to girt my Temple round. But, why, oh why, my Ligurine, Flow my thin teares, downe these pale cheeks of mine? Or why, my well-grac'd words among, With an uncomely silence failes my tongue? Hard-hearted, I dreame every Night I hold thee fast! but fled hence, with the Light, Whether in Mars his field thou bee, Or Tybers winding streames, I follow thee. Ode IX. 3 Booke, to Lydia. Dialogue of Horace, and Lydia. Hor. Whilst, Lydia, I was lov'd of thee, And ('bout thy Ivory neck,) no youth did fling, His armes more acceptable free, I thought me richer then the Persian King. Lyd. Whilst Horace lov'd no Mistres more, Nor after CloÃ« did his Lydia sound; In name, I went all names before, The Roman Ilia was not more renown'd. Hor. 'Tis true, I'am Thracian Chloes, I Who sings so sweet, and with such cunning plaies, As, for her, I'l'd not feare to die, So Fate would give her life, and longer daies. Lyd. And, I am mutually on fire With gentle Calais Thurine, Orniths Sonne; For whom I doubly would expire, So Fates would let the Boy a long thred run. Hor. But, say old Love returne should make, And us dis-joyn'd force to her brazen yoke, That I bright CloÃ« off should shake; And to left-Lydia, now the gate stood ope. Lyd. Though he be fairer then a Starre; Thou lighter then the barke of any tree, And then rough Adria, angrier, farre; Yet would I wish to love, live, die with thee. Fragmentum Petron. Arbitr. The same translated. Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short; And done, we straight repent us of the sport: Let us not then rush blindly on unto it, Like lustfull beasts, that onely know to doe it: For lust will languish, and that heat decay, But thus, thus, keeping endlesse Holy-day, Let us together closely lie, and kisse, There is no labour, nor no shame in this; This hath pleas'd, doth please, and long will please; never Can this decay, but is beginning ever. Epigramma Martialis. Lib. viii. Lxxvii. The same translated. Liber, of all thy friends, thou sweetest care, Thou worthy in eternall Flower to fare, If thou be'st wise, with 'Syrian Oyle let shine Thy locks, and rosie garlands crowne thy head; Darke thy cleare glasse with old Falernian Wine; And heat, with softest love, thy softer bed. Hee, that but living halfe his dayes, dies such, Makes his life longer then 't was given him, much. [Though I am young, and cannot tell, ] Though I am young, and cannot tell, The Song. Which while Karolin sings, Aeglamour reads. Either what Death, or Love is well, Yet I have heard, they both beare darts, And both doe ayme at humane hearts: And then againe, I have beene told Love wounds with heart, as Death with cold; So that I feare, they doe but bring Extreames to touch, and meane one thing. As in a ruine, we it call One thing to be blowne up, or fall; Or to our end, like way may have, By a flash of lightning, or a wave: So Loves inflamed shaft, or brand, May kill as soone as Deaths cold hand; Except Loves fires the vertue have To fright the frost out of the grave.</field>
