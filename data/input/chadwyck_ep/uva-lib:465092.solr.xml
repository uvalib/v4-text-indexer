To the Right Honourable Sir FRANCIS BLAKE DELAVAL, KNIGHT OF THE BATH. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE ODES OF HORACE. ODE I. TO MÆCENAS. Different men have their several pleasures: Horace affects the name of a poet, especially in the lyric cast. Mæcenas, of a race renown'd, Whose royal ancestors were crown'd; O patron of my wealth and praise, And pride and pleasure of my days! Some of a vent'rous cast there are, That glory in th'Olympic car, Whose glowing wheels in dust they roll, Driv'n to an inch upon the goal, And rise from mortal to divine, Ennobled by the wreath they twine. One, if the giddy mob proclaim, And vying lift to To the three greatest honours of Rome; to be either ediles, prætors, or consuls. threefold fame; One, if within his barn he stores The wealth of Lybian threshing-floors, Will never from his course be press'd, For all that Attalus possess'd, To plow, with sailor's anxious pain, In Cyprian sloop th'Egean main. The merchant, dreading the south-west, Whose blasts th'Icarian wave molest, Praises his villa's rural ease, Built amongst bowling-greens and trees; But soon the thoughts of growing poor Make him his shatter'd barks insure. There's now and then a social soul That will not scorn the Massic bowl, Nor shuns to break in a degree On the grave day's solidity; Now underneath the shrubby shade, Now by the sacred fountain laid. Many are for the martial strife, And love the trumpet and the fife, That mingle in the din of war, Which all the pious dames abhor: The sportsman, heedless of his fair, With patience braves the wintry air, Whether his blood-hounds, staunch and keen, The hind have in the covert seen, Or wild boar of the Marsian breed, From the round-twisted cords is freed. But as for Horace, I espouse The glory of the scholar's brows, The wreath of festive ivy wove, Which makes one company for Jove. Me the cool groves by zephyrs fann'd, Where nymphs and satyrs, hand in hand, Dance nimbly to the rural song, Distinguish from the vulgar throng. If nor Euterpe, heavenly gay, Forbid her pleasant pipes to play, Nor Polyhymnia disdain A lesson in the Lesbian strain, That, thro' Mæcenas, I may pass 'Mongst writers of the Lyric class, My muse her laurell'd head shall rear, And top the zenith of her sphere. ODE II. TO AUGUSTUS CÆSAR. Many storms and tempests are inflicted upon the Roman people, to avenge the death of Julius Cæsar. The sole hope of the empire is placed in the safety of Augustus. Surely at length it may suffice, These frequent storms of snow and hail, Which Jove, commission'd from the skies, So dreadful to prevail! And hurling from his flaming arm His vengeful bolts, 'midst thunder-show'rs Has o'er the city spread th'alarm, And smote the sacred tow'rs. Thro' all the world th'alarm is spread, For fear of those portentous days, When Proteus on the mountain's head Made his sea-monsters graze. On topmost elms the scaly race Stuck where the ring-doves us'd to be, And tim'rous deer, expell'd their place, Swam in the whelming sea. We saw the sandy Tiber drive Huge billows from th'Etrurian strand, And e'en at Vesta's fane arrive To mar, what Numa plann'd. Whilst vengeful 'gainst the will supreme He fondling hears Ilia, the mother of Romulus, was cast into the Tiber; and hence (as some will have it) poetically called his wife. It is likely she was very fond to walk by that pleasant river, till she was wedded to the place. his wife complain, And flooding to the left his stream, He glories in our bane. Thinn'd by our crimes our sons shall tell, How Romans whet the sword and spear, (Against the Persians had been well) And all our broils shall hear. What pow'r to save her sinking name Shall Rome invoke, what urgent suit Shall Vesta's holy virgin's frame In hymns that bear no fruit. What worthy, for the nation's aid, Our crimes t'atone shall Jove assign, Come white-rob'd Phœbus, as we've pray'd, Do thou thyself divine? Or if thou rather wouldst befriend Glad queen of Eryce's perfumes, Whom love and pleasantry attend With their ambrosial plumes— Or, Mars, if thou at length wouldst speed, O founder of the Roman race, To visit thy neglected seed, Now sunk into disgrace: Too long indulg'd thy cruel sport, Whom noise, and polish'd helms delight, And the fierce Moor's determin'd port, And aspect in the fight. Or if the part you can sustain, By thee the righteous deed be done, You The poet here supposes Augustus to be Mercury, in a human shape. There are many reasons (says Rodellius) wherefore Augustus might be likened to Mercury: for if the courier in ordinary of the Gods was expert in business, quick, and resembling a lively youth, Octavius, the minister of providence for the repose of mankind, was all this also, at that time being twenty-three. Mercury was the God of genius and address, Octavius a very great patron of the one, and a most consummate master of the other., which yourself a mortal feign, O gentle Maia's son: Late may'st thou be again receiv'd, And long in gladness rule our state, Nor thee at all our vices griev'd, Th'unwelcome gale translate! Here rather be the triumph priz'd, And, father, emp'ror dear to Rome, Delight thine ear—nor unchastis'd, Let scamp'ring Medes presume! ODE III. [So may the queen of Cyprus' isle] He prays that the ship may have a good passage, which was about to carry Virgil to Athens: after which he, with great spirit inveighs against the temerity of mankind. So may the queen of Cyprus' isle And Helen's brethren in sweet star-light smile, And Æolus the winds arrest, All but the fav'ring gales of fresh north-west, O ship, that ow'st so great a debt, No less than This ode is to be referred to the year of Rome 734, in which Virgil made a voyage to Athens, intending there to put the last hand to his Eneid at his leisure. He was scarce arrived, when Augustus returning from the East to Italy, brought him back with him; but being taken ill on ship-board, he was put ashore at Brandusium, where, the year following, he died, aged fifty-one. Virgil, to our fond regret! By thee on yon Athenian shore Let him be safely landed, I implore: And o'er the billows, as they roll, Preserve the larger portion of my soul! A heart of oak, and breast of brass Were his, who first presum'd on seas to pass, And ever ventur'd to engage, In a slight skiff, with ocean's desperate rage; Nor fear'd to hear the cracking masts, When Africus contends with northern blasts; Nor Hyads, still foreboding storms, Nor wrathful south, that all the depth deforms; Than whom no greater tyrant reigns Whether the waves he ruffles or restrains. How dauntless of all death was he, Whose tearless eyes could such strange monsters see; Cou'd see the swelling ocean low'r, Or those huge rocks, which in Epirus tow'r! Dread Providence the land in vain Has cut from that dissociable main, If impious mortals not the less On this forbidden element transgress: Determin'd each extreme to bear, All desp'rate deeds the race of mortals dare. Prometheus, with presumptuous fraud, Stole fire from heav'n, and spread the flame abroad, Of which dire sacrilege the fruit, The lank consumption, and a new recruit Of fevers came upon mankind, And for a long delay at first design'd, The last extremity advanc'd, And urg'd the march of death, and all his pangs inhanc'd, With wings, not giv'n a man below, Did Dedalus attempt in air to go. Th'Herculean toil, exceeding bound, Broke through the gulf of Acheron profound. Nothing too difficult for man, He'll scale the skies in folly, if he can; Nor by his vices every day Will give Jove leave his wrathful bolts to stay. ODE IV. TO SEXTIUS, A PERSON OF CONSULAR DIGNITY Though this Sextius always had favoured his friend Brutus, and even at this time respected his memory, insomuch as to preserve busts of him in his house, yet Augustus, in love with such fidelity, not without prodigious applause for his generosity, chose him his colleague, in the year of Rome 713, from whence, I conjecture (says Rodellius) that this Ode was written the year following, there being no reason to call Sextius happy before his consulate, and the season of the consulate itself not being for indulging the genius in matter of festivity.. By describing the delightfulness of spring, and urging the common lot of mortality, he exhorts Sextius, as an Epicurean, to a life of voluptuousness. A grateful change! Favonius, and the spring To the sharp winter's keener blasts succeed, Along the beach, with ropes, the ships they bring, And launch again, their watry way to speed. No more the plowmen in their cots delight, Nor cattle are contented in the stall; No more the fields with hoary frosts are white, But Cytherean Venus leads the ball. She, while the moon attends upon the scene, The Nymphs and decent Graces in the set, Shakes with alternate feet the shaven green, While Vulcan's Cyclops at the anvil sweat. Now we with myrtle shou'd adorn our brows, Or any flow'r that decks the loosen'd sod; In shady groves to Faunus pay our vows, Whether a lamb or kid delight the God. Pale death alike knocks at the poor man's door, O happy Sextius, and the royal dome, The whole of life forbids our hope to soar, Death and the shades anon shall press thee home. And when into the shallow grave you run, You cannot win the monarchy of wine, Nor doat on Lycidas, as on a son, Whom for their spouse all little maids design. ODE V. TO PYRRHA. Horace has escaped from the allurements of Pyrrha, as from a ship-wreck. He affirms such as are ensnared by her love to be in a state of wretchedness. Say what slim youth, with moist perfumes Bedaub'd, now courts thy fond embrace, There, where the frequent rose-tree blooms, And makes the grot so sweet a place? Pyrrha, for whom with such an air Do you bind back your golden hair? So seeming in your cleanly vest, Whose plainness is the pink of taste— Alas! how oft shall he protest Against his confidence misplac't, And love's inconstant pow'rs deplore, And wondrous winds, which, as they roar, Throw black upon the alter'd scene— Who now so well himself deceives, And thee all sunshine, all serene For want of better skill believes, And for his pleasure has presag'd Thee ever dear and disengag'd. Wretched are all within thy snares, The inexperienc'd and the young! For me the temple witness bears Where I my dropping weeds have hung, And left my votive chart behind To him that rules both wave and wind. ODE VI. TO AGRIPPA. Varius, the tragic and epic poet, will with more address sing the atchievements of Agrippa. Horace is only fit to celelebrate revels, and take pictures from middle life. Brave and victorious in the fight, Our Varius with Mæonian flight Shall thine atchievements blaze, Whate'er, beneath thy great command, The troops have done by sea and land, In fierce desire of praise. Agrippa, I cannot attain The grandeur of the epic strain, Tho' rous'd by deeds like thine, Nor colour up the glowing page With Peleus son's immortal rage, Nor reach the great design That artful hero to recount, Who could by sea such toils surmont; Nor sing the barbrous race Of Pelops, while the bashful lyre Thy praise and Cæsar's on the wire Forbids me to disgrace. What mortal pen can Mars recite, In adamantine armour bright, Or with the life compare Meriones in dust involv'd, Or him, Menerva's aid resolv'd The Gods themselves to dare? I sing of sports and am'rous play, (For all these things are in my way) And nymphs of sportive veins, That are so apt to scratch and tear With nails which to the quick they pare Against their fav'rite swains. ODE VII. TO MUNATIUS PLANCUS, A PERSON OF CONSULAR DIGNITY Munatius Plancus, upon the death of Cæsar, at first sided with Octavius, and was consul with M. Lepidus, in the year of Rome, 712. After that he went over to Antony, and did not return to Augustus till 722, who, in consideration of what was past, perhaps not putting any great confidence in him, made no use of him in the war, which that very year was denounced against Antony and Cleopatra. Plancus upon this, being in a state of chagrin, stood in need of that consolation which Horace endeavours to give him in this ode. Some writers praise one city or region, and some another. Horace prefers Tibur to all the world, in which place Plancus was born, whom he exhorts to the washing away of care by wine. Let others sing the praise of famous Rhodes Or Mytilene, or th'Ephesian pride, Or chant the walls of Corinth in their odes, Wash'd by a different sea on either side, Or Thebes for Bacchus, Delphi justly fam'd For Phœbus, or Thessalian Tempe's vale; Some make the seat of Pallas, nymph unblam'd, The theme of one uninterrupted tale, And run all lengths to wear an olive-crown— Many for Juno, with poetic zeal, Argus so apt for cavalry renown, And, rich Mycenæ, boast thy public weal. With me nor patient Sparta, nor the plains Of high-manur'd Larissa e'er cou'd take, As where Albunea's tinkling fount remains, Or Anio roaring down into the lake. And old Tiburnus' grove for ever green, Where flow'ring orchards give a strong perfume, Where marshal'd trees upon the stream are seen, And in the waggling waters wave their bloom. As the white south at times serenes the skies, Nor are his gathring show'rs for ever rife; So thou, O Plancus, 'gainst thy cares be wise, With mellow wine dismiss the toils of life, Whether the camp, with shining standards gay, Detain you ready for the hour of fight, Or in your native Tibur you shall stay, And in the dense embow'ring shades delight. When Teucer by his father was oppress'd, And driv'n away from Salamis he fled, He thus his weeping company address'd, As, wet with wine, the poplar bound his head. “Sped on by fortune, kinder than my sire, “O my co-mates, we'll go where'er she pleases; “Despair of nothing and to all aspire— “By Teucer's guidance Teucer's auspices. “For Phœbus has of certainty foretold, “That in a land to us advent'rers new, “Fair Salamis a doubtful name shall hold, “O brave companions, O my faithful few! “Ye that with me have harder things endur'd, “Than all the evils which ye now sustain, “This day your grief and care with wine be cur'd, “To-morrow sends us to the depth again.” ODE VIII. TO LYDIA. He animadverts upon Sybaris, a youth distractedly in love with Lydia, and wholly dissolved in pleasures. I charge thee, Lydia, tell me straight, Why Sybaris destroy, Why make love do the deeds of hate, And to his end precipitate The dear enamour'd boy? Why can he not the field abide, From sun and dust recede, Nor with his friends, in gallant pride, Dress'd in his regimentals, ride, And curb the manag'd steed? Why does he now to bathe disdain, And fear the sandy flood? Why from th'athletic oil refrain, As if its use would-be his bane, As sure as viper's blood? No more his shoulders black and blue By wearing arms appear; He, who the quoit so dextrous threw, And from whose hand the jav'lin flew Beyond a rival's spear; Why does he skulk, as authors say Of Thetis' fav'rite heir, Lest a man's habit should betray, And force him to his troops away, The work of death to share? ODE IX. TO THALIARCHUS. The greater the violence of the winter, the more we should indulge in festivity. See high Soracte, white with snow, Still more and more a mountain grow, Nor can the lab'ring woods their weight sustain, And motionless with frost the sharpen'd streams remain. Dissolve the cold, a rousing fire Upon the social hearth aspire, And four years old with bountiful design Bring in the Sabine jar the long-expected wine. Leave to th'immortal Gods the rest, For when they shall have once supprest The winds, that on the boiling surge contend, Nor cypress shakes a leaf, nor yon old ash-trees bend. Enquire not of to-morrow's fate, And whatsoever chance await, Turn to account, nor fly from sweet amours, Nor let the dance be shunn'd by such address as The pronoun tu being emphatical in the original, it is likely that Thaliarchus was an excellent dancer. yours. While yet your vig'rous years are green, Nor peevish age brings on the spleen, By turns the field, the tenis-court repeat, And whispers soft at night for assignations meet. Now glad to hear the damsel raise The laugh, that her retreat betrays, Steal from her arm the pledge for theft dispos'd, Or from her finger force, with sham-resistance clos'd, ODE X. TO MERCURY. Whom he praises for his eloquence, his parentage, for the invention of the lyre and A school for wrestling, and other manly exercises. palestra, for his great address in pilfering, and for the offices that he discharges. O thou, which, eloquent and chaste, From Atlas sprung, rough man to rule, And form our sons to toil and taste As in th'Athenian school. Thee will I sing, great Jove's courier, Inventor of the lyre confest; Expert to steal and disappear, And turn it to a jest. Thee when a boy, with threats injoin'd To bring the steers you had withdrawn, Apollo laugh'd aloud to find His quiver also gone. King Priam likewise, thee his guide, Deserting Troy with all his wealth, Atreus his haughty sons defy'd, And hostile camp by stealth. The pious souls to realms of love, Your golden rod compels to go, O grateful to the Gods above And to the pow'rs below. ODE XI. TO LEUCONOE. He advises Leuconoe to indulge in pleasure, regardless of all care for the morrow, by deducing his arguments from the brevity and fleetness of life. In order to imitate the metre of the original, the longest measure in the English tongue (much in use amongst our old poets) is here introduced: but, for convenience of printing, one line is severed into two. Seek not, what we're forbid to know, The date the Gods decree To you, my fair Leuconoe, Or what they fix for me. Nor your Chaldean books consult, But chearfully submit, (How much a better thought it is?) To what the Gods think fit. Whether more winters on our head They shall command to low'r, Or this the very last of all Shall bring our final hour. E'en this, whose rough tempestuous rage Makes yon Tyrrhenian roar, And all his foamy breakers dash Upon the rocky shore. Be wise and broach your mellow wine, Which carefully decant, And your desires proportionate To life's compendious grant. E'en while we speak the moments fly, Be greedy of to-day; Nor trust another for those pranks Which we may never play. ODE XII. TO AUGUSTUS. Having celebrated the Gods, heroes, and certain famous men, at last he comes to the divine honours of Augustus. Clio, to sing on pipe or lyre, What man, what hero is your choice, And with what God will you inspire Glad echo's mimic voice? Or in the Heliconian shade, Or Pindus or cool Hæmus sped, Where the vague woods at random stray'd With Orpheus at their head? E'en he who, by his mother's art, The loud cascade, the rapid wind Cou'd stop—and ears to oaks impart, To his soft airs inclin'd? First then the usual form of praise Is his, who men and Gods impow'rs, The earth, the sea, the world he sways, The seasons and the hours. From whom no greater can proceed, To whom no being's like or near; Yet Pallas challenges the mead Of secondary fear. Nor thee, brave Liber, will I slight, Nor thee, fair Forrester, the foe Of beasts, nor thee which aim'st so right, Dread Phœbus, with thy bow. Alcides next, and Leda's twins, In chivalry and cestus too I praise, whose star, when it begins To bless the seaman's view, Its brightness makes the waves subside, The winds are still, the clouds disperse, And smooth at their command's the tide, That roar'd but now so fierce. Now shall I Rome's first founder sing, Or Numa's peaceful reign commend, Or Priscus great and mighty king, Or Cato's glorious end? Great Regulus I will enroll, The house of Scaurus, Paulus write, So lavish of his godlike soul, And grateful thee recite, Fabricius, with rough Curius join'd; Him and Camillus too for arms A hardy poverty design'd In their paternal farms. As imperceptibly the pines, Marcellus, so thy fame aspires: The Julian star, like Luna, shines Amongst the lesser fires. Sire and preserver of our race, From Saturn sprung, do thou A word attempted in the peculiarity of Horace—grant by deligation, make over your right. convey, That Cæsar hold the second place In thine eternal sway; Whether o'er Parthia's threatning host At a just triumph he arrive, Or, subject to the eastern coast, Confed'rate Indians drive. Subordinate to thee alone, He o'er the happy world shall reign, While thou shalt thunder from thy throne On each polluted fane. ODE XIII. TO LYDIA. He is very uneasy that his rival Telephus is preferred to him by Lydia. When Lydia to my rival tells How Telephus, her Telephus excells; And harps upon his manly charms, His neck so rosy-red, and iv'ry arms; Alas! I boil with jealous ire, And all th'internal man is set on fire. Then are my pow'rs of reason weak, My colour comes and goes, and down my cheek The trickling tears of anguish steal, Proof of the ling'ring fever that I feel. I burn, if in th'immod'rate broils Of liquor thy white sleeves the tipler soils, Or in a raging am'rous fit, Has left his mark upon the lips he bit. Believe me, Lydia, in the end You cannot hope his love will long extend, Who to your kisses is so rude By Venus in nectareous balm imbu'd. O happy thrice, and thrice again! Who without breach still hug the pleasing chain; Nor ever any bick'ring strife Can part them till the last extreme of life. ODE XIV. TO THE REPUBLIC OF ROME, ON THE RENEWAL OF THE CIVIL WAR. New floods of strife that swell the main, O ship, shall bring thee out again; O wherefore venture? 'tis your fort To keep your station in the port. Do not you see your sides bereft, Till not a single oar is left, And, wounded by the rapid blast, Groan the crack'd sail-yards and the mast? Nor are there scarcely farther hopes, That your old keel, despoil'd of ropes, Can longer hold it out to brave The fury of th'impetuous wave. Thy canvas is no longer tight, Nor Gods to sue in evil plight, Tho' once a Pontic pine you stood, And daughter of a noble wood, May'st boast a vain descent and form— The tim'rous seaman in a storm Trusts not in painted planks—be warn'd, Lest by the hissing winds you're scorn'd. Late my vexation and my care, Still my desire and constant pray'r, Yet may'st thou from those isles be free That glister in th'Ionian sea. ODE XV. THE PREDICTIONS OF NEREUS CONCERNING THE DESTRUCTION OF TROY. When Paris ship'd in base deceit, Against all hospitable laws, Fair Helen in th'Idean fleet, Nereus injoin'd the winds a pause; And hush'd into the peace, they hate The rapid murm'rers, while he sung Each cruel circumstance and date Of distiny, that o'er them hung. “Ill-omen'd her you take to Troy, “Whom Greece united shall reclaim, “And Priam's ancient reign destroy, “And your connubials with the dame. “What deaths attend the Dardan realm! “What toils for man and steed to bear! “See Pallas now her shield, her helm, “Her car and all her wrath prepare! “In vain, presumptuous in the aid Of Venus, you your hair shall tire, “And grateful to each list'ning maid “Run soft divisions on the lyre. “In vain the spears and Cretan dart, “So dread to amorous delight, “You shall avoid with timid heart, “And Ajax swift to urge your flight. “Yet late, too late, adultr'ous swain, “You shall your locks in dust besmear, “See there Ulysses, see the bane “Of Troy with Pylian Nestor near. “The Salaminian Teucer speeds— “See warlike Sthenelus arrive, “Who, if there's need of martial steeds, “Is excellent those steeds to drive. “Thou too, Meriones, shall know, And more heroic than his sire “Hear Diomed, thy deadly foe, “In wrath to find thy post inquire. “Whom you in panting haste shall fly, “Tho' Helen heard another tale, “As harts the wolf they chance to spy, “Heedless of pasture in the vale. “Long as Achilles' wrath shall last, “Thy Phrygian dames shall stave their doom, “But Grecia's flames, some winters past, “Shall Trojan tow'rs consume.” ODE XVI. TO HIS MISTRESS. He is reduced to sing a recantation; for he begs pardon of a young lady whom he had offended with certain Iambics: and he shifts the blame upon his passionate temper, whose uncontroulable violence he describes. To that lampoon against your fame, O fairer than the beauteous dame That bore thee, put what shameful end you please, Whether in flaming fire, or Adriatic seas. Cybele, nor the priest possest, Phœbus himself an inward guest, Not Liber can the settl'd temper shake, Not Corybantian drums with all the noise they make; Like baleful ire, which neither blade Of Noric temper has dismay'd; Nor ship-devouring seas, nor fire-flakes red, Nor Jove himself up-roaring in tremendous dread. 'Tis said Prometheus was controul'd To work into the human mould Some portion took from brutes of every kind, And to the stomach's pride the lion's wrath assign'd. 'Twas wrath that could Thyestes quell, By such a downfal, great and fell, That final overthrow of towns, where now O'er the raz'd walls the foe drive their insulting plough. Take warning and suppress your rage; Me also, in my blooming age, Such sallies cou'd seduce too far to dare, And in the keen Iambic satyrize my fair. But now I would myself endear, And for the gentle change severe, Provided she my recantation view, And be again my sweet, and all my hope renew. ODE XVII. TO TYNDARIS. He invites her to Lucretilis, shewing her sundry advantages that she should reap from the place. Brisk Faunus oft Lyceus flies, And to Lucretilis applies, And there defends, in situation sweet, My goats from showery winds, and from the burning heat. Secure without another ward, The wives of their unsavoury lord, At large on thyme and arbute shrubs are fed, Nor do their kids fierce wolves or lurking adders dread. But more especial is their peace, If you the imprison'd notes release, And those sweet strains, O Tyndaris, you play, Ustica's sloping groupe of marble piles repay. The Gods protect, the Gods espouse My lyric muse, and faithful vows, Here you shall fully taste a welcome guest, The horn of rural honours heap'd for thee and prest. Here in a valley's close retreat You shall avoid the dog-star's heat, And here shall harp upon the Teian string, Penelope and Circe vying for the king. Here shaded, innocent and light, You shall partake the Lesbian white, Nor to your bow'r shall Mars himself betake, Nor Semele's Thyoneus his disturbance make. And, though suspected to be here, You shall not ruffian Cyrus fear, Lest his rude hands should not your sex forbear, But pull your chaplet off, and the poor night-gown tear. ODE XVIII. TO QUINTILIUS VARUS. Quintilius Varus having enjoyed great posts, and even the consulship itself at Rome, was at last overthrown in Germany with a very great slaughter, called the Varian defeat, and esteemed most deplorable in the judgment of Augustus. This defeat happened shortly after the death of Horace, which (I suppose) makes Rodellius doubt whether this Quintilius Varus, to whom this ode is addressed, be the same. Wine moderately taken, makes the heart glad, but drank to excess, creates madness. The English metre is the same as in ode the eleventh. Varus, you shou'd no tree prefer Before the sacred vine, If you to plant the kindly soil Of Catilus design. For to the droughty all things hard Has Heav'n and nature made; Nor can we rankling care escape Without the bottle's aid. Who make a racket in their cups, Of want or war's distress, Nor rather Bachus, sire of joy, And graceful Venus bless? But lest we shou'd transgress and take More liquor than we ought, The Centaurean battles warn O'er such carousing fought. Great Bacchus is a warning too As most severely just Against Sithonians right and wrong Confounding in their lust. To thee my candid A name of Bacchus, from the Hebrew Bassar, which signifies to work in the vineyard. Bassareus I will not do despite; Nor bring from underneath the leaf What best had shunn'd the light. Restrain your Berecynthian horn, And hush your savage drums, After whose clam'rous din, self-love In partial blindness comes; Vain glory next, with empty head Aloft, is wont to pass; And tattling treachery succeeds Seen through as clear as glass. ODE XIX. OF GLYCERA. That he is inflamed with her love. The mother of the fierce desires And Semele the Theban's son inspires, And wanton wilfulness assures To render up my heart to fresh amours. Bright Glycera my soul inflames, Whose lustre e'en the Parian polish shames, And her sweet archness fans the blaze, And slipp'ry looks that balk the lover's gaze. Her Cyprus now deserting quite, Venus on me careers with all her might, Nor lets the Scythian be rehears'd, Nor Parthian furious with his steed revers'd, As things impertinent to sing. Here, lads, in rolls the living verdure bring, And frankincense and vervain place With wine of two years old to crown the vase. A victim welt'ring in his gore, Her presence will propitiate the more. ODE XX. TO MÆCENAS. He invites Mæcenas to an entertainment by no means sumptuous. Dear knight, with me you shall partake In sober cups of Sabine wine, Poor bev'rage of Horatian make, Which with these hands of mine Was well secur'd that very day, When such applause in thund'ring roar Was giv'n your merit at the play; Till from the sounding shore Of Tiber takes its rise from Tuscany, the native country of Mæcenas. your own Tiber, back it came, And at Mount Vatican arriv'd. There echo, pleas'd t'augment your fame, The gen'ral peal reviv'd. You on Calenian juice can dine, And may rich Cæcuban afford; But Formian or Falernian wine Appear not at my board. ODE XXI. TO APOLLO AND DIANA. He exhorts the damsels and boys to sing their praises. Ye tender virgins, Dian sing, Ye lads, the smooth-fac'd Phœbus praise; And lov'd so much by heav'ns high king, Latona likewise grace the lays. Praise her that loves the streams and groves, Such as cold Algidus o'ershade, Or in black Erymanthus roves, Or Cragus ever-verdant glade. Ye vying youths of Tempe tell, And Delos, Phœbus native place; Him, whom the bow becomes so well, And lyre of true Mercurial grace. He, if he tearful war inflicts, Or wretched famine, as you pray, Against the Persians and the Picts From Cæsar shall the plague convey. ODE XXII. TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS. Integrity of life is on all sides in security, and that he proves by an instance of himself. One sound and pure of wicked arts Leaves to the blacks their spear and bow, Nor need he deadly tinctur'd darts Within his quiver stow. Whether the suns of southern flame, Or barb'rous Caucasus he braves, Or goes, where of romantic fame, Vast tracts Hydaspes laves. For careless, out of bounds to rove, (A song on Lalage my plan) Me swordless in the Sabine grove A wolf beheld, and ran. A monster, such as ne'er was fed In warlike Daunia's beechen plain, Nor e'er that nurse of lions bred, E'en Juba's dry domain. Me in those lifeless regions place, Where trees receive no fost'ring gale, Whence Jove has turn'd away his face, And clouds obscure prevail; Or place me, where the sun too near, No huts can stand the heat above, Sweet-smiling, sweetly-prattling dear, My Lalage I'll love. ODE XXIII. TO CHLOE. There is no reason why Chloe should shun the touch of man, whom in the maturity of her bloom she is now fit for. Me, Chloe, like a fawn you fly, That seeks in trackless mountains high Her tim'rous dam again; Alarm'd at every thing she hears, The woods, the winds excite her fears, Tho' all those fears are vain. For if a tree the breeze receives, That plays upon the quiv'ring leaves When spring begins to start; Or if green lizards, where they hide, Turn but the budding bush aside, She trembles knees and heart. But I continue my pursuit, Not like the fierce Getulian brute, Or tyger, to assail, And of thee life and limbs bereave— Think now at last 'tis time to leave Thy mother for a male. ODE XXIV. TO VIRGIL. Who lamented inconsolably the death of Quintilius. What can abash the mournful strains, Or bounds prescribe to grief, like this, For those most precious dear remains, Of which we have so great a miss? Melpomene, do thou the dirge inspire, To whom Jove gave the liquid voice and lyre. Has then eternal sleep possess'd This Quintilius is not the same with him to whom the eighteenth ode is addressed, but a native of Cremona, a poet by profession, and a near relation of Virgil; which latter circumstance particularly endeared him to Horace.Quintilius, mod'rate, just and kind, Where shall our grievance be redress'd, Or where will ye his equal find, O modesty, and faith, the fair allies Of justice, and the truth without disguise? —An object of exceeding grief To many, virtuous, did he fall— But thou, O Virgil, art the chief, More inconsolable than all— In vain, alas! you to the Gods resent Him, who was not on such conditions lent. What tho' your own majestic lays Shou'd, sweeter far than Orpheus' lyre, Give ears to laurels and to bays, You cou'd not make his corpse respire, Or bid the blood in that cold image flow, Which Mercury, the minister below, Has to the gloomy crowd compell'd, In locking up the doors of fate, Nor will he be by pray'r withheld, However musical and great— 'Tis hard—but manly patience must endure, And make things lighter, that admit no cure. ODE XXV. TO LYDIA. He insults her, that now being old, she is deservedly contemned by her gallants. More sparing the young rakes alarm The window-shutters of their toast, You now may sleep secure of harm; The door affects the post, Which mov'd so oft its pliant hinge— —You hear that serenade no more, “Sleep'st thou, while dying lovers winge, “O Lydia, at thy door!” Jilt, thou the scoffing sparks shalt soon Lament, neglected in a lane, When, at the changing of the moon, The north-west blows amain; While love and vehement desire, Such as the mares for stallions seize, Shall set your blister'd breast asire, Join'd to complaints like these, That gladsome youths on ivy green And constant myrtle rather glote; To Hebrus winter's comrade keen, The wither'd leaves devote. ODE XXVI. TO THE MUSE, CONCERNING This is the same Lamia with him, ode xvii. book iii. where we shall have more occasion to take notice of him. ÆLIUS LAMIA. It is not fitting that the votaries of the muses should be liable to solicitude and grief. The poet recommends his friend Lamia to the Pimplean muse. Friend of the muses, fear and pain I throw into the Cretan main, To be the sport of ruffian tempests there— Who the cold north shall sway is far beneath my care. I in peculiar unconcern Profess myself, whatever turn The great affairs of Tiridates take, And all th'alarming dread, that keep his thoughts awake. O muse of the Pimplean hill, That lov'st to taste the genuine rill, Weave me those flow'rs that brightest beams receive, Yea elegance and fragrance for my Lamia weave. Without that influence of thine, Vain are the honours I design, Thou and thy graceful sisters ought to smile, To him devote new strains, and in the Lesbian style. ODE XXVII. TO HIS BOTTLE-COMPANIONS. That they should not quarrel and fight with their cups, as is the manner of barbarians. With glasses form'd for joy to fight, Is what the Thracians do in spite; Let Bacchus know no barb'rous customs here, But keep the modest God from bloody discord clear. Can such strange contraries agree, As wine and lights in social glee, And sabres such as savage Media wears— Cease your vile noise, my friends, nor quit your easy chairs. Me too!—shall I your revels join, And sour my good Falernian wine?— No, let the brother of the Locrian fair, Rather his lovesick joys, and darling flame declare. He will not—On no other plan, No other terms I take my can— Whatever damsel e'er thy breast inflam'd, Was of ingenuous birth, nor need you be asham'd. Whatever be the case speak out To friendly ears, nor make a doubt.— “Ah wretch! how thou art hamper'd in a straight, “A lad, whose matchless worth deserv'd a better fate.” What sorceress, what magic art, What pow'r divine can ease thy smart?— E'en Pagasus to clear thee will be loth From one compos'd of whimsy Chimæra. ?????? ???? ?????? ?? ??????, ????? ?? ???????. Hom., wantoness and wrath. ODE XXVIII. [Archytas, born to compass land and sea] Archytas a philosopher and geometrician is introduced remonstrating to a certain sailor, that all must die, and beseeching that he would not suffer his corpse to lie unburied on the shore. Archytas, born to compass land and sea, And of the countless sand thy charts to make, A little boon of dust suffices thee, Which on Matinian shores thy relicks take. Nor is there profit in those airy dreams, When you the houses of the planets try'd, And the round world determin'd by your schemes, Since in your death all these grand projects dy'd. The sire of Pelops in like manner fell, Tho' with the Gods he feasted in the sky; Tithonus chang'd into a sauterelle, And Minos in Jove's secrets wont to pry. Death too has got Pythagoras, asserted that his identical spirt, about seven hundred years before, was the soul of Euphorbus the son of Panthous, who was slain at the siege of Troy. Panthoides again, Tho' having taken from the wall his shield, He cou'd so well the Trojan times explain, Nor ought to death but skin and nerves cou'd yield. This was no mean professor in the ways Of truth and nature, as you did presume— But night, a gen'ral night, its wing displays, And all at length must travel to the tomb. The furies some expose to martial rage, The greedy sailors perish in the wave, The funerals increase of youth and age, None from fell Proserpine themselves can save. Me, e'en Archytas, the outrageous south, Upon oblique Orion sure t'attend, Where that Illyric opes her gulphing mouth, Involved at once in an unlook'd-for end. But thou, O sailor, do not check thy hand, Nor grutch on these unburied bones to throw A little portion of the common sand— So may the eastern blasts, whate'er you owe, Whate're they threaten to th'Hesperian floods, (Thee safe) make Venusinian forrests pay, And Jove and Neptune, with great store of goods, Thee to Tarentum's port, in peace convey. But shou'd you this benevolence neglect, A fraud about to hurt your sons unborn, Perchance, a due reward you may expect, Of equal terror, and of equal scorn. If not my prayers, my curses must prevail, And no atonement can thy conscience clear, 'Tis not so much (tho' you're in haste to sail) To sprinkle thrice the dust in kindness here. See this ode finely imitated by Matthew Prior. ODE XXIX. TO ICCIUS. It is a marvel almost up to a prodigy, that Iccius the philosopher, laying aside his studies, should take a turn to arms, through desire of riches. My friend, you're now invidious grown, To make th'Arabian wealth your own, And 'gainst unconquer'd Saba war declare, And for the barb'rous Mede his future chains prepare. What virgin, when her love is slain, Shall be a handmaid in thy train? And, when thou din'st, what youth from out the court, Shall stand with essenc'd hair, thy splendour to support? An archer of paternal craft, Skill'd to direct the Indian shaft!— Who now denies but streams their ways may force Back to the lofty hills, and Tiber change his course, When you choice books so dearly bought, On doctrines that Panætius taught, And your Socratick stock for armour sell, Whose taste for better things at first set out so well? ODE XXX. TO VENUS. He requests the goddess to come to the temple, which Glycera had dedicated to her. Leave Cyprus, thou that art the queen Of Guidus, and the Paphian isle, And with my Glycera be seen, Where, in her temple deck't and clean, With frankincense she courts thy smile. With all his ardour bring thy boy, The nymphs, the graces loose and free; Youth's goddess too, that has no joy, With Mercury, whose mirth wou'd cloy, Without thine influence and thee. ODE XXXI. TO APOLLO. He asks not riches of the God, but only a sound mind in a sound body What shall the pious poet pray Upon the dedication day; What vow prefer to this Phæbean shrine, While from the bowl he pours the first-fruits of his wine? Not the rich crop Sardinia yields, Nor of Calabria's sunny fields The herds I ask, nor elephants nor gold, Nor grounds of which still Liris leaves the tale untold. Let the Calenian grape be press'd By those whom fortune has possess'd; Let the rich merchant in gold cups exhaust The wine, which to replace his Syrian venture cost: Dear to the Gods, since thrice or more In one year he can travel o'er Th' So-called from Atlas the highest mountain in Mauritania, which is the extremity of Africa towards the streight of Gades (now Cadiz) beyond which the Romans at that time had but little notion of land. Atlantic sea undamag'd, while with me Sweet olives, mallows light, and succ'ry best agree. Grant, God of song, this humble lot, But to enjoy what I have got, And I beseech thee keep my mind intire In age without disgust, and with the chearful lyre. ODE XXXII. TO HIS LYRE. He addresses his lyre, and requires of it assistance, and that it should not cease to accompany his song. If e'er at leisure in the shade We've play'd a lesson to remain: My lyre, the like be now essay'd, A true Augustan strain. Thou whom that Alcæus. Lesbian touch'd so sweet, Tho' with his soldiers arms he bore Val'rous, or moor'd his shatter'd fleet Upon the swampy shore. Yet Venus and her clinging boy, And wine to musick wou'd he set, And on fair maids his skill employ, With hair and eyes of jet. O pride of Phœbus, grateful shell, Accepted where the gods regale, Thou, that can'st sooth my toils so well, 'Tis Horace bids thee hail! ODE XXXIII. TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS. That he should not grieve out of measure, that his rival was unjustly preferred to him by Glycera. Tibullus, do not grieve too much, Nor in soft elegies complain, That Glycera's caprice is such, And such her insolent disdain, That she your junior shou'd prefer, Who looks more amiable to her. For Cyrus fair Lycoris burns, So charming with her little face, But he the fondling damsel spurns For squeamish Pholoe's coy embrace; But sooner shall the goats be join'd To wolves of fierce Appulian kind, Than Pholoe with a filthy rake Commit adult'ry, heinous sin, Such mischief Venus loves to make, Who forms and tempers not akin Pairs with her cruel brazen yoke, And acts barbarity in joke. O'er me too in an evil hour Had servile Myrtale the sway, A nymph of more tyrannic pow'r Then Adria in Calabria's bay, Tho' at that time a fairer maid And gentler did my heart invade. ODE XXXIV. TO HIMSELF. He repents, that following the Epicureans, he had been wanting in his zeal to the Gods. A sparing and unfrequent guest In Jove's high temple at the best, While mad philosophy my mind pursu'd, I now must shift my sail, and have my course renew'd. For lo! the sempiternal sire (Who us'd to cleave with brandish'd fire The clouds, as I conceiv'd) of late was seen, With car and thund'ring horses in the clear serene. Which the still earth and floods that flow, And horrid Tænarus below, And those Atlantic bounds compels to quake; 'Tis God, and God alone pre-eminent can make The depths emerge, the mighty poor; 'Tis he, that brings to light th'obscure— And fortune, at his bidding takes a crown, Here proudly sets it up, there sternly throws it down. ODE XXXV. TO FORTUNE. He beseeches her to look to the preservation of Cæsar, then on the point of going against the Britons. O Goddess, whose indulgence sways Fair Antium sounding with thy praise, Whose influence can exalt the meanest slave, Or turn triumphant pomps to sorrow and the grave. Thee the poor farmer's anxious pray'r Solicits, that his fields may bear; Thee, mistress of the main, the sailor hails, As his Bithynian bark o'er Cretan billows sails. Thee the vague Scythians, Dacian rude, And cities, nations unsubdu'd, The Latian fierce for battle far and near, Thee the barbaric queens and purple tyrants fear. Let not your hurtful foot displace The pillar standing on its base, Nor let the thronging populace rebel, And roaring out to arms, to arms the state-compel. Necessity signifies here the last extremity or death, and things mentioned to belong to her, were all instruments of torture amongst the Romans.Necessity precedes thy band, With nails and wedges in her hand, Her brazen hand, nor is the hook, nor, hot With execrable death, the melted lead forgot. Thee hope, and faith, so scarce, revere, And cloath'd in white are ever near, And still themselves of your own train profess, Howe'er you bilk the great, and change your seat and dress. The faithless mob and courtezan Behave upon another plan; And all your friends, when they have drank you dry, The burthen they should share, in base desertion fly. Yet, yet propitiate Cæsar's scheme On Britain, and the world's extreme, And all our new recruits, that well might brave, The eastern continent, and Erythrean wave. O fie upon the barb'rous times, Fraternal wounds, and civil crimes, What has this iron-age refus'd to do! What have we left untouch'd, that honest hearts shou'd rue! Our youth, where have they been restrain'd: What altars are there left unstain'd— Yet 'gainst the Scythian and Arabian foe May all our new-forg'd weapons by thy guidance go! ODE XXXVI. TO POMPONIUS NUMIDA. For whose return from Spain, he rejoices with much exultation. With the sweet censer and the lyre, And fatted calf upon the sacred fire, The tutelary Gods we bless, That we our Numida once more caress; Who safe and sound from farthest Spain, Dear to a thousand friends, is come again— And yet to none such love he bears, With none the fond embrace so warmly shares, As with lov'd Lamia, mindful still That they were form'd by one preceptor's skill, And both together chang'd their gown— Set the good day in white memorials down; The ready cask by no means spare, Nor let your feet the morrice-dance forbear. Yet Damalis the tippler check, Lest Bassus she out-drink—the table deck With store of parsley, many a rose And lily, that in transient sweetness blows. They all will turn their putrid eyes On Damalis, who will not quit her prize; But her new conquest hugs in hold, As the ambitious ivies the tall oak infold. ODE XXXVII. TO HIS COMPANIONS. Whom he invites to indulge their geniuses on occasion of the victory at Actium. To drink and dance with all the glee Of men that find their country free Now, now's the time—now deck the hallow'd shrine, Like Mars his active priests, and make the temple fine. Before it was no lawful thing The long-kept Cæcuban to bring, While for th'imperial capitol the queen Ruin and wrath prepar'd, and every deadly scene, With her contaminated train Of eunuchs, arrogant and vain, In hopes to compass every point at last, Drunk with a long success, and her good fortune past. But now her rage is somewhat tame, Since scarce a ship escap'd the flame, And, tho' at large the Egyptian grape she swill'd, With real horrors now her frantic soul is fill'd. For as from Italy she flies, His urgent oar Augustus plies, And, as the hawk pursues the dove, he rows, Or sportsman hunts the hare trac'd in Æmonian snows, That he this monster of her kind Might in coercive fetters bind— But she, while for a nobler death she tried, Nor fear'd the hostile sword, nor sought herself to hide. Then to her downcast court she went, With look serene, as in content, And to her gen'rous veins the aspicks laid, By pre-determin'd death more fierce and desp'rate made. For the Liburnian fleet, she grudg'd The fate to which she was adjudg'd, A woman of her pow'r and pomp allow'd, In triumph to be dragg'd before the clam'rous crowd. ODE XXXVIII. TO HIS SERVANT. He would have him bring nothing for the gracing of his banquet but myrtle. In the original metre exactly. Persian pomps, boy, ever I renounce them: Scoff o' the plaited coronet's refulgence; Seek not in fruitless vigilance the rose-tree's Tardier offspring. Mere honest myrtle that alone is order'd, Me the mere myrtle decorates, as also Thee the prompt waiter to a jolly toper Hous'd in an arbour. THE SECOND BOOK OF THE ODES OF HORACE. ODE I. TO C. ASINIUS POLLIO. He advises Pollio to forbear the writing of tragedy for a “season, till the state should be settled. And afterwards he praises his compositions. The war, that rose from civil hate In that Metellian consulate, Our vices, measures, and the sport of chance, The famous triple league, the Roman shield and lance, With gore unexpiated, smear'd, A work whose fate is to be fear'd You treat, and on those treacherous ashes tread, Beneath whose seeming surface glow the embers red. O spare a little to repeat Your tragic verse severely sweet; Soon, when the public weal you shall replace, Your grand Athenian works again the stage shall grace. Thou who defend'st the poor with zeal, To whom the conscript house appeal, For whom the fertile laurels, that you wore In that Dalmatian triumph, deathless honour bore. E'en now you make my tingling ear The din of martial trumpets hear, Now clarions bray, and men in armour bright The routed horse and horsemen with their lightning fright. Now mighty captains I perceive, In clouds of glorious dust atchieve Eternal fame, and all the world their own, Save the ferocious fire of Cato's soul alone. Juno and every pow'r propense, Like her, for Africa's defence, When unreveng'd they left their darling coast, Offer'd the victor's grandsons to Jugurtha's ghost. Say where the blood of Romans slain, Has not made fertile every plain Whose monuments record our impious deeds, And our great downfal heard by the remotest Medes? What gulphs, what rivers in their flow Do not our dire dissensions know? What sea is not discolour'd by the gore Of Romans basely slain, what climate, or what shore? But leaving mirth, O do not urge My Pollio's muse, the Cean dirge— In some cool grotto sacred to the fair, With me and sweet Dione touch a lighter air. ODE II. TO C. SALLUSTIUS CRISPUS. He applauds Proculeius for his generosity to his brethren. The contempt of money makes the wise-man and the monarch. The hoarded silver is not white, Thou foe to metal in the mine, Unless by circulation bright And mod'rate use it shine. Let This generous Roman, having several brothers divested of their fortunes, for bearing arms against Cæsar, divided his substance amongst them. Proculeius live in song, A father to his brethren known; Fame jealous-wing'd, shall bear along The bounty, he has shown. A vaster realm you shall subdue, By conq'ring of a greedy mind, Than Lybia and the Gades too With either Carthage join'd. —The self-indulging dropsy grows, Nor slacks its thirst, until the cause From out the pallid body flows, And watry pain withdraws. The Phraates. king restor'd, and repossess'd, Not like the crowd fair virtue views, Nor numbers him amongst the bless'd, The language to abuse; The laurel, diadem and reign She more to that great man applies, Who looks upon immod'rate gain With unaffected eyes. ODE III. TO DELLIUS. Either fortune is to be borne with moderation, since the same condition of mortality equally impends on all. O Dellius, that art born to die, On equanimity rely, As well in adverse days your spirits buoy, As keep the hour of wealth from light presumptuous joy. Whether you lead a life of woes— Or in your distant mead repose, And bless the festal days in rural state, With right Falernian wine of more interior date, Where the tall pine, and pop'lar white, To form a social bow'r delight With blending boughs, and diligent to glide, The riv'let urges haste against its winding side. To wine and unguents here exhort, And roses of a bliss too short, While circumstance and age allow their leave, And those black threads of death the fatal sisters weave. You must from purchas'd park and seat, Which yellow Tiber laves, retreat— You must retreat, and your appointed heir Shall soon possess the heaps you pil'd with so much care. If rich and of Inachian race, Or, poor and from a lineage base, You daily in th'inclement skies remain, It matters not, you must remorseless death sustain. To one point we are all compell'd— The universal urn is held, From whence, or soon or late, the lot is cast, And Charon's boat transports the convicts at the last. ODE IV. TO XANTHIUS PHOCEUS. There is no reason that he should blush for the love he bears to his waiting maid Phyllis, since the same thing has been the case with sundry great men. O Phoceus, think it no disgrace To love your maid, since Thetis heir, Tho' proud, of old was in your case, Briseis was so fair. —The slave Tecmessa at her feet Saw her lord Ajax—Atreus son Lov'd his fair captive in the heat Of conquest, that he won, When beat by that Thessalian boy, The Phrygian host was disarray'd, And Hector's death, the fall of Troy, An easy purchase made. Who knows what wealth thou hast to claim, Rich parents may thy Phyllis grace, Surely the Gods have been to blame To one of royal race. You cannot think her meanly born, Nor worthless cou'd her mother be, Whose heart has such ingenuous scorn For wealth, and love for thee. Her face, her limbs so form'd t'engage, I praise with a safe conscience still— Shun to suspect a man, whose age Is going down the hill. ODE V. ON LALAGE. The most beautiful Lalage is a maiden unripe for a husband, wherefore the inclination to possess her ought to be restrained. As yet her tender neck's unbroke, Nor to confine her in the yoke Will all your skill avail; As yet she cannot suit her mate, Nor stand to bear the mighty weight Of an impetuous male. Your little heifer's fancy feeds On verdant lawns and flow'ry meads, Whose haunts she has preferr'd; And by the streams, which willows shade, She loves to have her gambols play'd With younglings of the herd. Forbear preposterous desire, Nor at the eager grape aspire, Anon shall autum speed; And mark each bunch with blooming blue, And vary into purple hue The clusters ripe to bleed. She soon shall follow thee of course, For time goes on without remorse, And to her days shall add The rip'ning years, that make thee old, And Lalage, maturely bold Shall seek a sturdy lad— Beloved!—coy Pholoe not so well Nor Chloris celebrated belle, With chest erect and white, As Luna shining o'er the sea, And smiling with celestial glee, Or Cnidian Gyges bright; Whom if you place amongst the fair He'll make sagacious strangers stare, As puzzl'd in the case; Nor can they tell his sex with truth, By reason of his looks and youth, And smooth ambiguous face. ODE VI. TO SEPTIMIUS. He wishes to have Tibur and Tarentum for the retreat of his old age, whose pleasant situation he extols. Septimius, who wou'd go with me, To Gades, or unconquer'd Spain, Or Syrtes, where the moorish sea Bids endless tempests reign? Be Tibur, by a Grecian plann'd, A seat for Horace in his years, Weary alike of sea and land, And martial hopes and fears. From whence if driv'n by cruel fate, May I Galesus see in peace, Where great Phalanthus rul'd in state, And watch'd his cover'd fleece. With me that little angle takes Whose honey's of Hymettian zest, And with the oil Venafrum makes Their olives stand the test. Where Jove gives winter warmth—and length To spring,—and Aulon's heights arise, Rich with those wines, whose luscious strength With true Falernian vies. These scenes to us their site commend— Those tow'rs so pleasant to the view: There the live ashes of thy friend, With tears thou shalt bedew. ODE VII. TO POMPEIUS VARUS. Whose return to his native country he congratulates. O Pompey! oft reduc'd with me To danger's last extremity, When Brutus led the van—what pow'r on high Restores thy native Gods, and an Italian sky? Thou principal and dearest friend, With whom I've made the day suspend Its course, infringing on the hours of care, With bays, and precious essence on our shining hair. With thee I saw At Philippi. that fatal field, Where shamefully I left my shield In rapid flight, when valour's heart was broke, And threat'ning heroes fell beneath the hostile stroke. But me Mercurius, much dismay'd, Quick thro' the midmost foe convey'd In a thick cloud—Thou wert ingulph'd again In struggling tides of war upon the swelt'ring plain: Wherefore to Jove the feast be paid, And let your weary limbs be laid, After long warfare, underneath my bay; Nor spare the casks I destin'd for this joyful day. Fill the bright tumblers to the brim, And in oblivious Massic swim, And from large shells the fragrant unguents pour. —Who runs to parsley beds, or to the myrtle bow'r, For cooling crowns? who throws the most To take the chair and give the toast? I will the Bacchanalian priests outdo— 'Tis sweet to lose one's wits at this dear interview. ODE VIII. TO JULIA BARINE. There is no reason to give any credit to Barine, when she swears, since she grows the handsomer for her perjuries. If any punishment or curse Had made thee thy false oath bewail; Hadst thou but been one tooth the worse, Or lost a single nail; I shou'd have kept my faith,—but thou Shin'st out more tempting and more fair; And art, by breaking of thy vow, Our youth's peculiar care. 'Tis profit, therefore, to deceive Thy mother's ashes in a breath, Stars, moon, and silent heav'n to grieve, And Gods, exempt from death. Yes, Venus laughs, and nymphs, well known For mock-simplicity, deride, And love still whetting on a stone His darts in crimson dy'd. But add to this new dupes abound, New slaves, nor will the old relent, Tho' sworn to quit her impious pound, Where their fond hearts are pent. At thee the jealous mothers pine, At thee old churls, and maids new wed, Lest by that winning air of thine Their spouses be misled. ODE IX. TO VALGIUS. That he would at length desist from bewailing the death of Mystes. Not show'rs from darkness without end Upon the shaggy fields descend, Nor ruffling whirlwinds o'er the Caspian reign For ever; nor prolong'd month after month remain, Friend Valgius, on Armenia's heights Of ice and snow, perpetual freights; Nor to the North do the plantations groan Of Garganus, nor ash trees their lost leaves bemoan. But you, in one continual dirge, Th'untimely death of Mystes urge, Nor with the fondness of your grief have done, When Vesper comes, or flies the bright-careering sun. Yet Nestor. he, who for three ages join'd, Liv'd an example of mankind, Did not, for all the remnant of his years, Antilochus, so loved, lament with ceaseless tears. No,—nor did Priam and his wife For Troilus, who lost his life In ruddy youth, with endless grief deplore, And ev'n his tender sisters in a while forbore. Cease from the softness of your grief, And let us rather sing our chief, The great Augustus has new trophies won, And bade the stiff Niphates with submission run. Euphrates too must roll his tide In billows more remote from pride, And those Gelonians, added to our reign, Must in the bounds prescrib'd their cavalry restrain. ODE X. TO LICINIUS. A mean is to be observed in either fortune. A better plan of life you form, Not wholly launching out from land, Nor over-jealous of a storm, Too much for shore to stand. Whoever loves the golden mean, From sordid want himself supports, Nor safe and sober is he seen In envy-moving courts. Tall pines are shaken, and the tow'r Comes heaviest from the highest wall, And thunderbolts, with greater pow'r, On topmost mountains fall. Hearts, well prepar'd, will see a dawn Of hope in woe—in wealth will pray 'Gainst change—heav'n brings the winter on, And drives the hag away. If times are evil, by and by They shall be better—Phœbus plays At times upon his minstrelsy, Not always shoots his rays. When times are hardest, then a face Of constancy and spirit wear; But wise contract your sails apace, When once the wind's too fair. ODE XI. TO QUINTIUS HIRPINUS. That waving cares we should live merrily. Whate'er the warlike Spaniard tries, Or what the Scythian bands devise, By Adria's sea disjoin'd, cease to enquire, Nor bustle for a life, whose term should check desire. Smooth youth and beauty must give way To wrinkles dry, and ringlets grey, Which from gallants their wanton loves divorce, And drive away sweet slumbers from their eyes of course. Not always does the vernal pride Of flow'rs remain, nor moon abide In one gay face—Your thoughts why do you teize, Not made for disquisitions so sublime as these? Why do we not secure our seat Beneath this plane-tree from the heat; Or thrown at random underneath this pine, Drink, while we may presume, and essenc'd roses twine In wreathes about our hoary hair, For Bacchus drives off biting care, Who's there? This same Falernian is too strong, The passing brook shall quench it, as it purls along. Who shall decoy that gadding lass, Lyde, to come and take a glass? Bid her with iv'ry lyre mature her haste, And hair ty'd up behind in the true Spartan taste. ODE XII. TO MÆCENAS. Weighty and tragical subjects are not proper for the Lyric stile. Horace will sing of nothing but the beauty of Lycymnia, and matters pertaining to love. Numantia's fierce and bloody wars, And Hannibal, your taste abhors, Too dire a subject for a song; Nor staining the Sicilian sea, Can Carthaginian blood to me And to my warbling lyre belong. Nor can the Lapithan malign, Nor over-charg'd with heady wine, Hyleus suit the lyric strain, Nor any giant son of earth, The victim of Herculean worth, And dread of Saturn's golden reign. But, O Mæcenas, as for you, You will for great Augustus do Far better in historic prose: With more address you'll tell than sing The story of full many a king, That drag'd in pomp triumphal goes. Me the harmonious muse allures, To chant my lady fair, and your's, And praise Lycymnia's charming voice, And eyes, that sparkle like the spheres, With faithful heart, that never veers, When she's once settled in her choice. She's graceful in each bright advance, Whether she lead the seemly dance, Or urge the brilliant repartees, Or with the noble damsels play, That honour Dian's holiday, Uniting dignity and ease. Would you in earnest change one lock Of sweet Lycymnia, for the stock That rich Achemenes possess'd, Or fertile Phrygia's wealthy fleece, Or all Arabia's ambergreese, And houses with all plenty bless'd. While she declines her blooming cheek, Where you the burning kisses seek, With such benevolent disdain, And what she'd rather have, than thee, Refuses, till she makes so free As to devour them all again. ODE XIII. UPON THE TREE BY WHOSE SUDDEN FALL HE HAD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN CRUSHED. It is never sufficiently evident what a man ought to beware of—the praises of Sappho and Alceus. 'Twas on a luckless day, O tree, Whatever hand transplanted thee, And impious bade thee prosper to disgrace The village of his birth, and crush his future race. He could, no doubt, to death devote His fire, or cut his mother's throat, Or sprinkle his unhospitable ground At night with stranger's blood, or Colchian drugs compound. Or whatsoe'er we may conceive Of desp'rate feats he could atchieve, O log, the man that plac'd thee in my farm, Hurl'd on thy master's head, that did not dream of harm. We never are enough aware What we should seek, or what forbear— From Bosphorus the sailor dreads his fate, Nor heeds what doom at Carthage may his days await. The soldiers fear the pointed reed, And Parthian shooting in full speed, The Parthian fears the Roman strength and chain, One common lot for all remains, and will remain. How near but now the lot was mine, So see the gloomy Proserpine, And Eäcus his dread judicial seat, And those Elysian fields, where melancholy sweet Sappho the sland'rous maids of Greece Arraigns, and in a fuller piece Alceus sings, upon his golden lyre The conquest or the flight by sea and land how dire! Each of these hands th'admiring ghost In holy silence hears, but most Th'attention and the thicking throng augment, To hear of patriot fights, and kings in exile sent. What wonder! since such strains as these The many-headed beast can please, Who hangs his hellish ears, and furies list, While from their wreathed locks delighted snakes untwist. Nay more, Prometheus, and the sire Of Pelops to the sound respire, Nor 'gainst the ounce or lions of the chace, Will now Orion urge his visionary race. ODE XIV. TO POSTHUMUS. Life is short, and death inevitable. Ah! Posthumus, the years, the years Glide swiftly on, nor can our tears Or piety the wrinkl'd age forefend, Or for one hour retard th'inevitable end. 'Twould be in vain, tho' you should slay, My friend, three hundred beeves a day To cruel Pluto, whose dire waters roll, Geryon's threefold bulk, and Tityus to controul. This is a voyage we all must make, Whoe'er the fruits of earth partake, Whether we sit upon a royal throne, Or live, like cottage hinds, unwealthy and unknown. The wounds of war we scape in vain, And the hoarse breakers of the main; In vain with so much caution we provide Against the southern winds upon th'autumnal tide. The black Cocytus, that delays His waters in a languid maze, We must behold, and all those Danaids fell, And Sysiphus condem'd to fruitless toil in hell. Lands, house, and pleasing wife, by thee Must be relinquish'd; nor a tree Of all your nurseries shall in the end, Except the baleful cypress, their brief lord attend. Thy worthier heir the wine shall seize You hoarded with a hundred keys, And with libations the proud pavement dye, And feasts of priests themselves shall equal and outvie. ODE XV. UPON THE LUXURY OF THE AGE HE LIVED IN. So great our palaces are now, They'll leave few acres for the plough. Wide as the Lucrine lake canals extend, And steril planes in sum the wedded elms transcend. Then violet beds, and myrtle bow'rs, And all the nosegay-blending flow'rs, Shall far and wide their spicy breath renew, Where for their former lords the fertile olives grew. There the thick laurel's green array Shall ward the fervid beams of day. Not so our founder's will, or Cato's lore, And all our bearded sires commanded things of yore. Their private fortunes were but small, But great the common fund of all. No grand piazzas did there then remain To catch the summer breezes of the northern wane. Nor did they, by their edicts wise, The providential turf despise, Those laws, which bade each public pile be grand, And with new stone repair'd, the holy temples stand. ODE XVI. TO GROSPHUS. All men covet peace of mind, which cannot be acquired either by riches or honours, but only by restraining the appetites. When o'er the Ægean vast he sails The seaman sues the gods for ease, Soon as the moon the tempest veils, Nor sparkling guide he sees. Ease by fierce Thracians in the end; Ease by the quiver'd Mede is sought; By gems, nor purple bales, my friend, Nor bullion to be bought. Not wealth or state, a consul's share, Can give the troubled mind its rest, Or fray the winged fiends of care, That pompous roofs infest. Well lives he, on whose little board Th'old silver salt-cellar appears, Left by his sires—no sordid hoard Disturb his sleep with fears. Why with such strength of thought devise, And aim at sublunary pelf, Seek foreign realms? Can he, who flies His country, 'scape himself? Ill-natur'd care will board the fleet, Nor leave the squadron'd troops behind, Swifter than harts, or irksome sleet Driv'n by the eastern wind. If good, the present hour be mirth; If bitter, let your smiles be sweet, Look not too forward—nought on earth Is in all points complete. A sudden death Achilles seiz'd, A tedious age Tithonus wore— If you're amerc'd, fate may be pleas'd To give to me the more. A hundred flocks around thee stray, About thee low Sicilian kine, And mares apt for thy carriage neigh, And purple robes are thine. Me, born for verse and rural peace, A faithful prophetess foretold, And groundlings, spirited from Greece, In high contempt I hold. ODE XVII. TO MÆCENAS, WHEN SICK. If he was to die, Horace has no inclination to survive him. Why do you send to break my heart With your complaints? We must not part; Nor can th'immortal gods consent, nor I, My glory and my guard, that thou the first shouldst die. Ah! if a more untimely fate On thee, my soul's ally, should wait, Why should I keep the wretched remnant here, Imperfect without thee, and never half so dear? One day shall be the last of both; I have not made a traitor's oath— Yes, we will go, together will we go, If you precede, I follow to the shades below. Me nor Chimera breathing fire, Nor Gyas, if he could respire, With all his hundred hands, should force from thee; So justice, heav'nly pow'r, and so the fates decree. If Libra rul'd my natal hour, Or Scorpio's more unlucky pow'r, Ey'd with the menace of an early grave, Or Capricorn, the tyrant of the western wave. Our horoscope, at all events, Ev'n to a miracle consents— Thee, lucid Jove, sav'd from Saturnian spite, And clipt the wings of fate, and stopt its rapid flight, Upon the day the crouded town Thrice hail'd in claps thy just renown— Me near that time a falling trunk had brain'd, If Faunus, shield of bards, had not the stroke refrain'd, These mercies therefore bear in mind, And bring the victims you design'd, And build the fane you vow'd upon the spot; A slaughter'd lamb from me will suit my humbler lot. ODE XVIII. [Gold or iv'ry's not intended] He asserts himself to be contented with a little fortune, where others labour for wealth, and the gratification of their desires, as if they were to live for ever. Gold or iv'ry's not intended For this little house of mine, Nor Hymettian arches, bended On rich Afric pillars, shine. For a court I've no ambition, As not Attalus his heir, Nor make damsels of condition Spin me purple for my wear. But for truth and wit respected, I possess a copious vein, So that rich men have affected To be number'd of my train. With my Sabine field contented, Fortune shall be dunn'd no more; Nor my gen'rous friend tormented To augment my little store. One day by the next's abolish'd, Moons increase but to decay; You place marbles to be polish'd Ev'n upon your dying day. Death unheeding, though infirmer, On the sea your buildings rise, While the Baian billows murmur, That the land will not suffice. What tho' more and more incroaching, On new boundaries you press, And in avarice approaching, Your poor neighbours dispossess; The griev'd hind his gods displaces, In his bosom to convey, And with dirty ruddy faces Boys and wife are driven away. Yet no palace grand and spacious Does more sure its lord receive, Than the seat of death rapacious, Whence the rich have no reprieve. Earth alike to all is equal, Whither would your views extend? Kings and peasants in the sequel To the destin'd grave descend. There, tho' brib'd, the guard infernal Would not shrewd Promotheus free; There are held in chains eternal Tantalus, and such as he. There the poor have consolation For their hard laborious lot; Death attends each rank and station, Whether he is call'd or not. ODE XIX. ON BACCHUS. Filled with the deity, the poet sings his praises. Bacchus I saw the other day (Posterity believe my lay) Teaching the science of poetic feet, While nymphs and satyrs listen'd in the rocks secrete. Ha! ha! this lab'ring breast of mine Is shock'd anew—and fraught with wine; My heart is joy—ha! ha! my Bacchus spare, Nor rear thine ivy wand too terrible to bear. Now the mad Thyads I can sing, Which struck out wine's perennial spring; And rivers that with milky current glide, And honey trickling down from hollow rocks beside. Now can I sing the brilliant dame Of heav'n, thy celebrated flame, The tow'rs of Pentheus levell'd with the ground, And downfal of Lycurgus to thy praise resound. You turn the rivers to the main, You those barbarian seas restrain, You in the sacred mountains debonaire Bind in serpentine knot unhurt your handmaid's hair. You, when the bands of giants rose Th'almighty father to depose, The lion's fangs and horrid jaws assum'd, Drove Rhœcus back to earth, and to destruction doom'd. Tho' dance, and lively jests, and sport For thee were fitter by report, Nor did your military talents strike, Yet facts have shewn thee proof for peace and war alike. Thee with your golden horn bedight, Saw Cerberus devoid of spite, And when from hell you made your last retreat, His tail he kindly wagg'd, and gently lick'd your feet. ODE XX. TO MÆCENAS. Horace supposing himself changed into a swan, will fly all the world over; from which adventure he infers, that his poetry will be immortal. Above the vulgar and the trite Transform'd, the poet takes his flight Thro' heav'n, and will be held on earth no more; But o'er th'abodes of man, of envious man, shall soar. Not I, the poor man's offspring scorn'd; Not I thus honour'd and adorn'd, As by Mæcenas to be call'd his friend, Shall know the Stygian stream, or share a common end. Now, ev'n but now, my skin began To roughen, and my upper man Of a white bird the radiant form assumes, And on my hands and neck spring forth the glossy plumes. Now a melodious swan indeed, Th'Icarian flight I shall exceed; And Bosphorus his roaring rocks will know, And Syrtes, and the plains of Hyperborean snow: The Dacians who so poorly feign To hold the Romans in disdain; The Colchan and Gelonians far remote, And skilful Spain and Gaul shall learn my works by rote. No dirges, squalid grief, or moan, At mine unreal death be shown; Your loud lamentings at my grave restrain, Nor care to build the tomb this verse has render'd vain. THE THIRD BOOK OF THE ODES OF HORACE. ODE I. [I hate the mob, and drive them hence] A happy life is effected not by wealth and honours, but by peace of mind. I hate the mob, and drive them hence, Lost to all sanctity and sense; Hist to the Muse's priest! hist I implore— I sing for maids and youths the strains unheard before. Dread sovereigns their own people sway, But Jove the kings themselves obey; He which in triumph hurl'd the giants down, And rules the universe by his commanding frown. One man, perhaps, out-plants his friend, In rows that regular extend; Another comes more noble to the poll, Another pleads his fame, and uncorrupted soul; Another will th'ascendant claim For clients—but 'tis all the same; Necessity demands us, dross and scum, And shakes the labell'd lots, and out they all must come. He, o'er whose head the naked steel Impends, will make no hearty meal From rich Sicilian fare—his sleep no more The chirping of the birds or harpers will restore— Sweet sleep's the lusty lab'rer's lot: Sleep does not scorn the lowly cot, Nor trees that o'er the riv'let interweave, Nor, Tempe, where the zephyrs play their pranks at eve. He who desires but neighbour's fare, Will for no storm or tempest care; Him setting bear nor rising goat offends, Nor all the wizzard-wit of diarist portends. Not vineyards beaten by the hail; Not flattering farm, whose symptoms fail, The trees now laying blame upon the showers, Now winter's pinching hand, or hot sidereal pow'rs. The fishes feel the waters shrink, Such loads into the depths they sink; Here many a proud surveyor with his slaves, And owner of the land, incroach upon the waves. But fear and conscience with her cries Aboard with the possessor flies; Nor care will from the top-mast head recede, And, when he lands, she mounts behind him on his steed. What if nor stone in Phrygia hewn Can keep the troubl'd mind in tune, Nor purple brighter than the painted sky, Nor rich Falernian grape, nor Persian luxury; Why should I set about a pile, High-pillar'd in the modern stile— A bait for envy?—Why should I exchange For cumbersome expence my little Sabine grange? ODE II. TO HIS FRIRNDS. Lads must be habituated from their tender years to poverty, warfare, and a laborious life. Train'd up, my friends, in toil severe, Let the young lad no hardship fear; But learn against fierce Parthians to advance, And on the gallant steed shake his tremendous lance. And let him lead a life of care In bustle and the open air— Him from the wall the tyrant's consort spies, And marriagable virgin sends her broken sighs. “Ah me! for fear my royal spouse “Should this ungovern'd lion rouze, “And with inferior skill provoke his rage, “Which breaks thro' thickest ranks the midmost war to wage.” 'Tis sweet, 'tis seemly ev'n to die For one's dear country—should'st thou fly, Death will pursue the youth afraid to fight, Nor spares his timid knees, and back, when turn'd to flight. Virtue which in the spirit tow'rs, And cannot, like this clay of ours, Sustain repulse, her fame unfully'd sees, Nor takes, nor quits her office, as light voters please. Virtue, to those that may not die, Opes the strait doors of heav'n on high, And with her wings in stretch for that sublime, Scorns the unletter'd mob, and sordid earth, and time. There's likewise an undoubted mead For silence, that its faith can plead; Him that mysterious rites has blaz'd—with me, Nor tent, nor tilt shall cover, or by land or sea. Oft the great regent of the day, If thoughtless man neglect to pray, In the same lot have vice and virtue cast, Justice, tho' lame and blind, will take her due at last. ODE III. [A man of truth and honour prov'd] A man of virtue is in dread of nothing. The speech of Juno concerning the destruction of Troy, of the end of the Trojan war, and of the Roman empire, which was to take its rise from the remnant of the Trojans. A man of truth and honour prov'd, And in his great resolves unmov'd, No clam'rous mob his principles can stir, Nor ev'n a tyrant's threat his manly heart deter. No—nor the south, whose dread command Fierce Adria's waves cannot withstand, Nor thund'ring Jove—the universe might fall, And not disturb his thoughts, or make him shrink at all. It was upon no other plan That Pollux was so great a man, And wand'ring Hercules atchiev'd the skies— Augustus too with them to rites divine shall rise. 'Twas by no other art than this, O Bacchus, sire of social bliss, Thine unbroke tygers drew thee to the stars, And Romulus 'scap'd death upon the steeds of Mars. For to the gods in council join'd Juno thus spake her gracious mind— “A foreign whore, and that dire Alluding to the judgment of Paris. umpire's lust, “Has Troy, ev'n Troy reduc'd to downfal and the dust. “By me and chaste Minerva doom'd, “E'er since Laomedon presum'd “The gods to rob of their most due reward, “And subjects shar'd the fate of their deceitful lord. “No more that ignominious guest “Is of the Spartan dame possest, “Nor Priam's perjur'd house prevails to break, “By Hector's strength alone, the forces of the Greek. “War by our diff'rent int'rests drawn “To such a length, is past and gone— “Henceforward I my wrath to Mars give o'er, “And hatred for the son the Trojan priestess bore. “Him will I suffer and befriend “Heav'n's lucid mansions to ascend, “To take his fill from our nectareous bowl, “And in the rank of gods his titles to enroll— “On this condition, that there be “'Twixt Troy and Rome a raging sea “For many a league—and let their exiles reign “And prosper where they will—so that there still remain “O'er Paris and o'er Priam's clay “The trampling herd, the beast of prey, “And cubs secure—The Capitol shall tow'r, “And vanquish'd Medes confess proud Rome's imperial pow'r. “Let her extend her fame and fear “To every region far and near, “Where the mid-sea from Europe Afric rives, “And where o'erflowing Nile the fertile land revives. “Deriving from contempt of gold “A spirit great and uncontroul'd— “Gold best unsought, and cover'd in the sand, “Rather than coin'd for use with sacrilegious hand. “Whatever pole or place be found “To give the world his utmost bound, “There let them pride their armies to engage, “Both where cold mists descend, or torrid sun-beams rage. “But this their fate my word confirms “For Romans on these only terms— “That they should not an ill-judg'd zeal embrace, “Nor think their mother-town they prosper to replace. “If Troy's estate should grow again, “Again their thousands must be slain, “Whilst I, Jove's sister and his wife, command “Against their rising works a new victorious band. “If thrice their walls of brass should rise, “By Phœbus helping from the skies, “Thrice should my Grecian champions lay it low; “Thrice leave their dames and sons to widowhood and woe.” But whither, Muse, do you aspire? These subjects are not for the lyre— Too grand and grave—cease, wanton, to rehearse The converse of the gods in light degrading verse. ODE IV. [Descend from yonder bright serene] The poet mentions his being delivered by the assistance of the Muses from sundry perils, and that it has turned out bad for all that have attempted to act against the gods. Descend from yonder bright serene, And sing, Calliope, my queen, A longer strain—or with your warbling tongue, Or, if you choose, the lute, or lyre by Phœbus strung. Hear ye not plain? Or is my thought By a transporting frenzy wrought? I seem to hear sweet sounds, and seem to rove Where pleasant airs and streams pass thro' th'Elysian grove. Me tir'd to sleep, and yet a child, From kind Apulia's bounds beguil'd, Up in mount Vultur, now so fam'd and known, The woodland doves conceal'd with foliage newly blown; Which was a miracle to tell By all th'inhabitants that dwell High-nested on the Acherontian brow, Or Bantine chace possess, or fat Ferentum plow. That I should there securely sleep, Nor bears should rush, nor vipers creep; That sacred bays and myrtle should combine To hide the dauntless boy by providence divine. Yours, O ye Muses! yours intire, I to the Sabine heights aspire— Me, whether cool Preneste shall invite, Or Tibur sweetly slop'd, or Baian baths delight. Me, fond of all your sylvan scene Your founts and gambols on the green; Not all our hopes Philippi render'd void, Nor rough Sicilian wave, nor cursed tree destroy'd. Whenever you shall be with me, Chearful I'll sail upon the sea Of raging Bosphorus, or go by land Through all the length and drougth of that Assyrian sand. Th'unhospitable Picts, the race Of quiver'd Scythia, will I face; And Concanum, with blood of horses fed, And Tanais, secure from detriment and dread. You Cæsar, of such high renown, Soon as he quarters in each town His wearied legions, bid his labours cease, And in Pierian gottoes multiply his peace. You kindly mod'rate measures urge, Rejoicing to refrain the scourge— We know him who alone the Titans quell'd, And hurl'd in thunder down the monsters that rebell'd— Ev'n he that rules the stormy main, The sluggish earth, and Pluto's reign, And all above, and all beneath the sun, Both gods and men commands, omnipotent and one. Depending upon strength of arm, Those desp'rate youths with dire alarm Insulted Jove, while all the brethren vie With Pelion on Olympus to ascend the sky. But Rhœcus and strong Mimas too, Or what could huge Porphyrion do, Or what Typhœus, or with trees up-torn Enceladus assaulting heav'n in impious scorn, Rushing against the sounding targe Of Pallas?—Here a furious charge Was made by Vulcan—there heav'n's royal dame, And he, who never quits his golden quiver, came, Who in the pure Castalion spring Laves his loose locks, who is the king Of Lycian wilds, Apollo is his name, Who Patara and Delos holds by natal claim. Force void of counsel rushes down By its own weight—but there's a crown Of blest event for courage mixt with care; But rashness heav'n detests, as working for despair. That Gyas with his hundred hands, Whose story upon record stands, And he Orion. th'attempter of the spotless maid, Slain by Diana's dart, confirm what we have said. The earth her groaning bosom heaves, And for each bury'd monster grieves, To dismal hell by thund'ring vengeance doom'd. Nor by the eager flames is Ætna yet consum'd. The bird that on the liver preys Of Tityus, ever-vengeful stays— Three hundred chains Perithous confine, And gall his am'rous flames, which burn'd for Proserpine. ODE V. [The thund'rer, as in heav'n supreme] The applause of Augustus, the dispraise of Crassus, the constancy of Regulus, and his return to the Carthaginians. The thund'rer, as in heav'n supreme, We from his dreadful bolts esteem; And Cæsar, like a god, directs our helm, Picts and vexatious Persians added to our realm. Have they, who under Crassus fought, With base barbarian wives been caught, And (O inverted manners, alter'd times!) With step-fathers grown old in foreign slavish climes? The Marsian and Appulian band, Beneath an haughty Mede's command, Forgetting Numa's shields—oval bucklers, used by the priests in processions, one of which being sent down from heaven, was esteemed a token of the establishment of the empire; which, that it might not be known or stolen away, Numa commanded eleven more to be made exactly like it, and to be kept in the temple of Mars. Numa's shields, and name, and gown, Jove's Capitol, and Rome subsisting in renown! The soul of Regulus the great Precluded such a shameful fate, Scorning all base conditions ev'n in thought, As exemplary bad, with future mischief fraught: If not unpity'd and unspar'd, Their doom the captive youth had shar'd— “I've seen our standard hung up for a show, “And troops by Punic foes disarm'd without a blow. “I've seen our citizens confin'd, “Ty'd with their free-born arms behind; “The hostile gates op'd in defiance wide, “And fields, we ravag'd, till'd in ostentatious pride. “What! shall the soldier bought and sold “Be braver when exchang'd for gold? “You add but loss unto an impious stain, “The poison'd wool its whiteness never can regain. “Nor valour, wrought to a reverse, “Can be repair'd by worse and worse— “If rescu'd from the toils, the tim'rous deer “Will turn and fight the hounds—then he shall cease to fear, “Who once has trusted to deceit; “And shall the Punic host defeat “Another time—who felt a ruffian tie “His coward hands with thongs, and was asham'd to die. “Such, helpless where to fix a ground “For hope, could peace and war confound— “O shame! O Carthage! infamously great “By our confirm'd disgrace, and Rome's subverted state!” 'Tis said, from his chaste wife's embrace And little boys, he turn'd his face, And look'd as one amerc'd upon the dust, With aspect manly stern, determin'd to be just, Until the conscript fathers all, With council most original, He did confirm—and 'midst his friends dismay And tears, the godlike exile forc'd himself away. And yet full clearly did he know The torments he should undergo— But waving all his kin with unconcern, And crowds of Roman people grutching his return, He cooly took his leave, as one, The business of the forum done, Goes for vacation to Venafran lands, Or where Tarentum, built by Phalantus. that fam'd Spartan, stands. ODE VI. TO THE ROMANS, ON THE CORRUPT MANNERS OF HIS AGE. Ye Romans, tho' not done by you, Ye must your fathers vices rue, Unless the holy temples ye repair, And images defil'd with filth and blackness there. You justly claim imperial sway, As ye th'immortal gods obey; Thence your beginning, there refer th'event; Oft heav'n, for our neglect, has doleful vengeance sent. Now twice Moneses and the band Of Pacorus has made a stand Against our luckless troops, and glad in scorn Equestrian collars seiz'd, their trinkets to adorn. While discord is our business grown, Almost we have been overthrown By Moors and Dacians, those by sea so dread, And these expert for jav'lins whirling at our head. Fraught with offence, at first the times Defil'd us with domestic crimes, Our marriage-beds, and families, and race, Whence all these murders sprang, and national disgrace. Our virgins, now no longer shy, Are proud th'Ionic step to try, And move by leud prescription in their bloom, And meditate on incest from the mother's womb. Soon, when her husband's at his wine, To younger sinners she'll incline, Nor care with whom the lawless bliss she prove, In hasty stealth, when once the candles they remove. But, not without her consort's leave, She boldly rises to receive Some broker, that will buy her to his arms, Or Spanish dupe, that pays full dearly for her charms. 'Twas not a race from sires like these That stain'd with Punic blood the seas, Slew Pyrrhus and Antiochus the Great, And beat Hamilcar's son at such a glorious rate; But a rough set of manly blades, And skilful with the Sabine spades To turn the glebe, and carry clubs of oak, Such as their rigid mothers from the wood bespoke. What hour the sun the shades enlarg'd, And from the yoke the steers discharg'd, Fatigu'd with toil, and urg'd with rapid flight The time for friendly sleep, or neighbourly delight. What does not mould'ring time impair! Worse than their sires our fathers were, And we, far worse than them, about to fill The world with baser men, and more degen'rate still. ODE VII. TO ASTERIE. He consoles her in her sorrow for her absent husband, and admonishes her to preserve the faith she had plighted to him. Asterie, why do you bewail Him, whom the zephyrs shall restore, Which fill with vernal breath the sail, Wafting Bithynian wealth on shore, The happy Gyges, whose fair truth is known, And constancy has made so much your own? He, driv'n by that autumnal When the constellation of the goat sets at the close of autumn, it generally stirs up showers and storms. goat And southern winds, is forc'd away, His meditations to devote On fair Asterie night and day, And joyless, sleepless, spends the year, With many a melancholy tear. And yet the busy footman speeds And many a subtle art he tries, To urge how Chloe burns and bleeds, And how she pines, and how she dies: And, anxious to receive him to her bed, Has many such like stories in her head, “How a false woman could persuade “King Prœtus, credulous too much, “With false pretences that she made “To murder him, who shunn'd the touch “Of all impurity and shame, “The chaste Bellerophon by name. “How Paleas was condemn'd almost “To hell, in that he had abstain'd, “And wary 'scap'd the am'rous post “Where fair Hippolyte remain'd.” And mentions many a novel tale, That teaches mortals to be frail. In vain—for deafer than the rocks Of Icarus he hears the lure, And as temptation's voice he mocks, Asterie, thou art still secure— And yet—Enipeus—give me leave— Do not with so much joy receive. Tho' (to be fair) no man can ride Upon the Martian plain so well: A goodly sight, of gallant pride, And skill equestrian to excel; Nor any active man alike Can through the yielding Tibur strike. Soon as the day begins to close, Shut up the doors, shut up the gate, Nor in the street yourself expose, Nor for the scurvy minstrels wait— The more they call you hard and hard, The more your doors and ears be barr'd. ODE VIII. TO MÆCENAS. Mæcenas is not to wonder why Horace celebrates the calends of March, notwithstanding he has no wife. Why, on the The calends of March were sacred to Juno, and particularly celebrated by married men and their wives. first of March, so clean, Free from the matrimonial god, Why flow'rs and frankincense are seen, And what these heaps of fewel mean Upon the living sod, Friend, is from your discernment hid, Tho' Greek and Latin are your own. Know then I vow'd a feast and kid To Bacchus. him, who did my death forbid, When down the tree was blown. This day, the chief of all by far, A special festival denotes, And shall remove from out the jar The cork smok'd down with pitch and tar, When Tullus had the votes. Take, for the safety of thy friend, An hundred bumpers at the least; On high the wakeful lamps suspend, Let wrath and clamour have an end, Nor interrupt our feasts. Cease each political conceit, Nor Rome let all your cares engage; The Dacian Cotison is beat, The hostile Medes, in self-defeat, Domestic warfare wage: The Spanish foe now pays the tax, Though by slow steps this wreath was won; The Scythian troops their bows relax, And, fearful of the Roman ax, The field of battle shun: The state, not as a man in pow'r, But as a private friend, repute; Leave things that are severe and sour For pleasures of the present hour, Wine, converse, harp, and lute. ODE IX. TO LYDIA. It is a Dialogue concerning their former loves, with a proposal for renewing them. Ho. Whilst my growing flame you nourish'd, Spotless of a rival's touch, Clasp'd within your arms I flourish'd, Not the Persian king so much. Ly. Ere you languish'd for another, And with Chloe was inflam'd, Lydia, greater than the mother Of the Roman race, was nam'd. Ho. Me indeed that Thracian beauty, Sweet musician, holds her slave; For whose life I deem it duty Death, ev'n death itself to brave. Ly. Me my Calais with such ardour Courts and kisses—him to spare— Death, or was there aught still harder, I ten thousand times would bear. Ho. What if our old flame recover, And our hearts again subdue, While the portal of your lover, Shut to Chloe, opes to you? Ly. Tho' he be as bright as brightness, Thou with cork, or with the sea, Well compar'd for wrath and lightness, I could live and die with thee. ODE X. UPON LYCE. He advises Lyce to lay aside hardheartedness, and to be mild to him in his state of submission. Far away, where Tanais flows, Had you been a Scythian's wife— Yet to see a man expose, At your cruel doors, his life, To the northern blasts a prey, Might have fill'd you with dismay. Hear you not the creeking door, How the winds, in ruffian haste, Make the grove-trees howl and roar Round the piles of Attic taste; And how Jove, with purer air, Glazes snow that settles there! To the queen of softer mould Cast away ungrateful pride, Lest you chance to lose your hold, When the knot of love's unty'd. You're not of the Tuscan breed, Right Penelope indeed.— Tho' nor bribes nor pray'rs prevail On that harden'd breast of thine, Nor complexion, violet-pale, Nor your spouse, who, 'midst his wine, Wounded by the vocal art Of a minstrel, yields his heart. Spare, yet spare your suppliant swains, Rougher than th'obdurate oak, Or the snakes, which Moorish plains To severer spite provoke— Constitution cannot last, Thus to bear the stormy blast. ODE XI. TO MERCURY. He requests Mercury to suggest to him such strains as may work upon the affections of Lyde, chusing for his subject the tale of the Danaids. O Mercury! for thou instill'd The notes of old Amphion sung, Who with his voice could cities build, And thou, O shell! compleatly fill'd, When sev'n-times sweetly strung; Nor vocal, nor in vogue of yore, Now known in palaces and fanes, In such inviting accents soar, As may tempt Lyde to her door, Attentive to thy strains. The tygers, with their woodlands wild, You to your train in pow'r compel; You make the rapid torrents mild, Th'enormous hell-hound heard, and smil'd, You play'd your lute so well. He smil'd—tho' on his Stygian head A hundred twisted snakes are hung, And steams of pestilential dread, And matter still with poison fed, Flow from his triple tongue. Ixion too, and Tityos, shew'd An irksome glimpse of ghastly joy, While to your melody renew'd, No more the Danaids pursu'd Their task of vain employ. Let Lyde hear the rueful tale, And punishment at last injoin'd, How they still ply the sieve-like pail, Which ever must be fill'd to fail, The monsters of their kind. The destiny that must remain For crimes beyond the grave to feel— Impious! what could be more a stain? Impious! their bridegrooms all were slain By their remorseless steel. But Hypermnestra. one of many was a bride, Whose merit grac'd the nuptial flame, To her false father nobly ly'd, And left her memory the pride Of everlasting fame. Who bade her youthful spouse “arise— “Arise (she said) with my reprieve— “Lest a long sleep should seal your eyes “Whence least you fear—my father's spies “And sisters too deceive— “Which, like so many beasts of prey, “With younglings in their rav'nous claws, “Ev'n now, alas! thy brethren slay— “But I will neither strike nor stay “Whom gentlest nature awes. “With chains me let my father load, “Because I chose my spouse to spare, “And pity on distress bestow'd— “Or make me settle my abode “In sharp Numidian air. “Convey'd by swiftness and the wind, “Begone, my love, in peace begone, “While Venus and the night are kind— “But when my monument's design'd, “Engrave my tale thereon.” ODE XII. TO NEOBULE. Neobule, smitten with the love of young Hebrus, leads a life of indolence and sloth. 'Tis wretched in earnest to live like a mope, Nor wash down chagrin with sweet wine; To yield to an uncle all spirit and hope, Who rails at your pleasures and mine. The charms of young Hebrus, and love's flying boy, Have stol'n your work-basket away, And all that fine tap'stry that us'd to employ, And give to Minerva the day. This gay Liparean's a notable knight, Bellerophon's self he may seem, Not beat in the battle, or match'd in the flight, When fresh from the cruse and the stream. The same in each motion's as clean as a cat, To hurl at the deer in the park, Thro' bushes and shrubs the wild-boar can come at, And his quickness ne'er misses the mark. ODE XIII. TO THE FOUNTAIN BLANDUSIA. He promises a sacrifice to the fountain, whose pleasantness he highly commends. Hail, clear as crystal to the eyes, Blandusia's fav'rite spring; O worthy to receive the prize Of wine and flow'rs we bring; To-morrow we shall give thy flood A kid, whose horns begin to bud, And fight and wantonness portend: In vain—his pranks must be no more— For shortly with his sacred gore He thy cool stream shall blend. Thee scorching Sirius cannot touch— You yield a pleasing shade, Which for the steers, when work'd too much, And wand'ring flock's display'd. Thou shalt be register'd by fame, A fountain of illustrious name, Whilst I thy useful beauties book; The oak so happy on the spot, To overhang thine hollow grot, Whence spouts thy pratling brook. ODE XIV. TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE. This ode contains the praises of Augustus, on his return from Spain, after having defeated the Cantabrians. Cæsar (of whom but now 'twas said, That, like Amphytrion's son, He went, at hazard of his head, To buy a wreath from Spain) is sped, And has the battle won. Let Livia, the wife of Augustus. her come forth, whose faithful heart Is center'd in her spouse, So great in military art, Having to heav'n perform'd her part, In rend'ring of her vows. And let Octavia too be there, And, with neat fillets bound, The mothers of the Roman fair, And youths the gods have deign'd to spare, In triumph to be crown'd. O lads and lasses newly bless'd, That have your bridegrooms known, Let not a word be now express'd, But in such decency is dress'd, As modesty may own. This day my festival indeed Shall banish care and pain, Nor will I fear by force to bleed, But from all trouble shall be freed, In Cæsar's peaceful reign. Perfumes and garlands bring to-day, And for a measure call, Whose date preserves the Marsian fray, If Spartacus, the famous gladiator, who stirred up the servile war. Spartacus, in quest of prey, Has not secur'd them all. Quick, with her hair set off with myrrh, Let me Neæra see, And bring her lute along with her; If that cross porter should demur, Come back again to me. A hoary head dispute abates, Though tempted to be sour, Nor appetite for wrath creates— I had not borne it, by the fates! When Plancus was in pow'r. THE END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II. O carminum dulces notæ, Quas ore pulchre melleo Fundis Lyræq; succinis! THE THIRD BOOK OF THE ODES OF HORACE [Cont'd.]. ODE XV. ON CHLORIS. That now being old, she would set some bounds to her impudence and lasciviousness. Poor Ibycus his wife, At length, methinks, 'tis time To quit your wicked life, And each flagitious crime: You should the better, sure, behave, Now you are verging on the grave. Sure now you should desist, Amidst the brilliant stars, To spread a gloomy mist: For decency debars That 'mongst the maidens you should play, Like Pholoe the young and gay. Your daughter, with less shame, May rouse up our young rakes, While Bacchanalian dame Her timbrel she awakes; The love of Nothus makes her brisk, Like goat upon the hill to frisk. The fair Lucerian fleece Not rosy wreathes to twine, Nor harps are of a piece With such an age as thine; Nor should an antiquated hag E'er boast of an exhausted cag. ODE XVI. TO MÆCENAS. All things are open to gold; but Horace is content with his lot, by which he remains in a state of happiness. A tow'r of brass, whose doors were barr'd With oak, while, howling, upon guard, Stood dogs, prepar'd to bite, Had been sufficient, to be sure, Imprison'd Danae to secure From rakes that prowl by night: If Jove, and she of ocean born, Had not Acrisius laugh'd to scorn, With all his anxious tribe; A way they found was fair and free, When once the god should make his plea, Transform'd into a bribe. Gold through the centinels can pass, And break through rocks and tow'rs of brass, Than thunder-bolts more strong: That Amphiaraus, a Grecian prophet, foreseeing he should die at the siege of Troy, kept himself concealed; but was betrayed by his wife, for the sake of a golden necklace. Argive prophet lost his life, And was undone, because his wife Was bought to do him wrong. The Macedon of such renown, With gifts the city-gates broke down, And foil'd his rival kings: Gifts ev'n can naval chiefs ensnare, Though rough and honest, they would care For more superior things. Anxiety pursues increase, And craving never like to cease— I have myself deny'd With cause to lift my crest on high, And with such men as thee to vie, O knighthood's peerless pride. The more a man himself refrains, The more from hea'vn his virtue gains: I pitch my tent with those Who their desires, like me, divest, And, as an enemy profest, The slaves of wealth oppose. More noble in my lowly lot, Than if together I had got Whate'er th'Appulian ploughs; And poor amongst great riches still, The fruit of no mean toil and skill, Could in my garners house. A wood of moderate extent, And stream of purest element, And harvest-home secure, Make me more happy than the weight Of Africa's precarious state Of empire could ensure. What tho' nor sweet Calabrian bee Makes his nectarious comb for me, Nor Formian wine grows old Within my cellars many a year, Though from rich Gallic meads I shear No fleeces of the fold: Yet want's remote, that wretched fate, That makes a man importunate— If more I should require, I should not be refus'd by you— But I must raise my revenue By curbing my desire. And better so, than should I add The Lydian realm to what I had, And all the Phrygian land; They that crave most, possess the least— 'Tis well where'er enough's the feast; Heav'n gives with frugal hand. ODE XVII. TO ÆLIUS LAMIA. The Ælian family was very illustrious in Rome, and very numerous—it comprehended likewise the house of Lamia, which did to it distinguished honour on account of its antiquity, insomuch that, if a man was better born than ordinary, he was proverbially called a Lamia. He extols the nobility of Lamia—He then advises him to spend the morrow with merriment. O sprung from Lamus! fam'd of old, Since by our fathers we were told, That you from him your family derive, And diaries that feast each rising year revive. From him, your fountain-head, you spring, Who was a most extensive king, And first the Formian walls was said to found On Liris for Marica in his current bound. To-morrow's eastern blast shall speed To strew with leaves and useless weed The groves, unless th'old raven's voice be vain, That witch of rising winds, and of descending rain. On your glad hearth dry billets raise, And (while 'tis lawful) let 'em blaze; Indulge to morrow on fat pig and wine, And servants call'd from work, with their gay lord to dine. ODE XVIII. TO FAUNUS. He beseeches the sylvan god, that, in traversing his fields, he would be propitious to Horace and his stock. O Faunus! ardent to pursue The nymphs that from thee bound, Propitious all my fields review, My sunny haunts—and favour shew To all my younglings round. If yearly with a tender kid Thy presence we invoke, And if to love and feasting bid, You daily see th'old altar hid In wreathes of fragrant smoke. The cattle on the grassy plain, Disport in active play; Both men and flocks at ease remain, December's nones to entertain, Which, Faunus, is thy day. The wolf amongst the lambs is seen, And by the sheep's defy'd; Down falls the foliage ever-green, The delvers dance with joyous mien, And throw their spades aside. ODE XIX. TO TELEPHUS. He raillies him in a jocose manner, that, describing ancient histories, he neglects things pertaining to a merry life. How distant from th'Inachian root Was patriot The last king of Athens, who gave his life for the good of his country. The Lacedemonians being engaged in war with the Athenians, were told by the oracle, that those should get the victory whose general should happen to be slain. Codrus, hearing of this, disguised himself, and went amongst the Lacedemonians, whom he provoked by abuse to put him to death, upon which the Athenians came off victorious. Codrus, who so bravely fell, You in your histories compute, Of Peleus' race, and Trojan wars you tell, But what a cask of Chian costs, And who the bath shall temper and prepare, When I shall 'scape these chilling frosts, And at whose house, to mention you forbear. Fill up, my boy, for this new moon, For midnight, and Muræna's num'rous At which Muræna was chosen augur. poll, Mix liquor handily and soon, Three or nine bumpers in each toper's bowl. The bard that loves th'odd-number'd train Of Muses, takes nine bumpers in his glee. The grace, with naked sisters twain, Fearful of wrangling, will admit but three. It is my pleasure to be mad, Why cease to blow the Berecynthian horn? Why hang the pipe and harp so sad? All niggard hearts and sparing hands I scorn. Bring roses, bring abundance in, Let neighbour Lycus, and his blooming girl, Unfit for Lycus, hear our din, To mortify that old invidious churl. At thee, with bushy hair so spruce, And bright as Vesper, buxom Chloe aims; Me slow-consuming cares reduce, As Glycera now checks, now fans the flames. ODE XX. TO PYRRHUS. That he should not force away the beautiful Nearchus from his mistress. O Pyrrhus! what art thou about, The lioness's cubs to move, And take her very fav'rite out? Full soon the plund'rer, none-so-stout, Th'attack will disapprove. When he shall pass along the train Of rakes, that for their mistress stir, Who shall have best of the campaign, Shalt thou thy friend to good regain, Or leave to vice and her? Mean time, while you the darts acute Present—she whets her dreadful tooth, Lo! he degrades beneath his foot That palm, the price of this dispute, The long-contested youth, With his loose locks perfum'd and curl'd, For sportive zephyrs there to play, Like Nireus in his form begirl'd, Or Ganymede. who, from Ida and the world, To heav'n was snatch'd away. ODE XXI. TO HIS WINE-JAR. He pleasantly admonishes it to pour out old wine for the sake of Corvinus, from whence he takes occasion to commemorate the praises of wine in general. O cask! that bears, like me, thy date From Manlius his consulate, Whether with murmurs, jests, or brawlings fraught, Or mad amours, or sleep, the kind relief of thought! Whatever be your long intent, Choice Massic, worthy to have vent On a good day, come forth at the behest Of my Corvinus, come with mellowness and zest. Not he, tho' forward to imbibe The lore of the Socratic tribe, Will brutish scorn thee—Cato, as they say, Would often warm with wine his virtue and his clay. To lend to sluggish minds a lift— And brighten harshness is thy gift— You take the cares from out a wiseman's breast, And make our politicians with their secrets jest. You doubtful minds by hope ensure, The horns exalting of the poor, Who, after he has fairly drank thee down, Nor heeds the soldiers arms, nor dreads the tyrant's frown. Bacchus and Venus on the spot, And graces ever in a knot, And living lamps shall eke thee out to-night, Till Phœbus drive the stars with his superior light. ODE XXII. TO DIANA. He consecrates the pine, which hangs over his villa, to Diana, whose offices he celebrates. Queen of the mountains far and near, And of the woodlands wild, Who, thrice invok'd, art swift to hear, And save the maids with child; This pine, that o'er my villa tow'rs, And from its eminence embow'rs, I dedicate alone to thee; Where ev'ry year a pig shall bleed, Lest his obliquity succeed Against thy fav'rite tree. ODE XXIII TO PHIDILE. The gods are to be worshipped with clean hands, and conscience of a well-spent life. If, heav'n-address'd, your hands and knees At each new moon the gods appease, And if a pig you slay, my rustic dame, And offer your first-fruits with incense in the flame; Your fruitful vineyard then shall scorn The Afric blast, nor shall your corn Be scarce or blighted—nor the fatal stroke, Amidst th'autumnal plenty reach your little folk. For the vow'd victim, that is fed Where Algidum his snowy head 'Midst holms and oaks uprears, or in the mead Of Alba, must beneath the pontiff's hatchet bleed. If you the lares crown and clean, With myrtle and with froth marine, 'Tis not requir'd that such as you and I Should on our altar cause whole hecatombs to die, If there a spotless hand you place, A sumptuous victim, in that case, Will not with heav'n more sure acceptance make, Than mix'd with good intent the little salted cake. ODE XXIV. UPON THE RICH AND COVETOUS. Though richer than the hoarded gain Of Araby and Ind unplunder'd yet, You of th'Appulian and Tyrrhenian main, Should with casoons and piers possession get; If deepest on the highest head Dire fate his adamantine hooks will drive, You cannot rid your fearful soul from dread, Nor from the snares of death escape contrive. The Scythians have a better lot, Who dwell in plains, and carry in a cart From place to place their customary cot, And those rough Getans, negligent of art, Whose common acres, unsurvey'd, Yield corn and fruit, that's bread for all the race; Nor do they drive the plough, or ply the spade, Above a year in one continu'd place. And when their annual toil is o'er, Another set the vacant lands receive, Who on the self-same terms with those before, As they succeed, the prior hands relieve. There her step-childrens orphan life The woman in her innocence will spare; Nor does the man obey a portion'd wife, Nor does she make a well-dress'd rake her care. Their parents great and virtuous fame, And, cautious, constant chastity's their dow'r. Thus runs the law: “Keep clear of sin and shame, “Or death's the wages from offended pow'r.” O that some sage would rise to quell Our impious slaughter, and our civil rage, Fond as his country's father to excel— So call'd beneath his bust—let him engage Our monstrous licence to revise— Fam'd to the latest times—since we, O shame! Hate virtue, when she's seen before our eyes, But envious, when she's gone, her worth proclaim. For what are all these woful cries, If sin by punishment is not cut off?— Laws without morals!—Can mere forms suffice For any thing but vanity and scoff? If such presumption still subsists, That neither torrid zone, nor northern pole, Nor solid snow, that mountain-high exists, Can terrify the merchant's sordid soul? The mariners expertly dare The horrid seas; for in their rough account Want is disgrace—they rather do or bear All ills, than virtue's arduous way surmount. Let us our gold and gems refund, Source of our woe, into the neighb'ring main, Or Capitol, where all our ears are stunn'd With party clamours, and the servile train. If we are penitent in truth, The very seeds of vice should be eras'd, And the too tender spirits of our youth, And nerves with exercise severer brac'd. Our noble youth have got no seat Upon their horse, and fear to urge the chace, As far more learned in the idle feat Of Grecian tops, or law-forbidden ace. Mean time the father's perjur'd heart Imposes on his partner and his guest, And hastes to try each method, and each mart, To make a worthless heir of wealth possest. For why? Ill-gotten goods increase— Yet after all their toil and time mis-spent, They have acquir'd by far too much for peace, And far too little to insure content. ODE XXV. TO BACCHUS. Roused by an inward goad from Bacchus, he proposes to speak certain new Lyrics concerning Agustus. Bacchus, with thy spirit fraught, Whither, whither am I caught? To what groves and dens am driv'n, Quick with thought, all fresh from heav'n? In what grot shall I be found, While I endless praise resound, Cæsar to the milky way, And Jove's synod to convey? Great and new, as yet unsung By another's lyre or tongue, Will I speak—and so behave, As thy sleepless dames, that rave With enthusiastic face, Seeing Hebrus, seeing Thrace, And, where feet barbarian go, Rhodope so white with snow. How I love to lose my way, And the vastness to survey Of the rocks and desarts rude, With astonishment review'd! O of nymphs, that haunt the stream, And thy priestesses supreme! Who, when strengthen'd at thy call, Can up-tear the ash-trees tall, Nothing little, nothing low, Nothing mortal will I show. 'Tis adventure—but 'tis sweet Still to follow at thy feet, Wheresoe'er you fix your shrine, Crown'd with foliage of the vine. ODE XXVI. TO VENUS. Worn out at length with old age, he takes leave of the lyre and his love affairs. Of late an able am'rous swain, I made full many a great campaign; But now my harp and arms, of edge bereft, Shall hang upon this wall, which rising on the left In sea-born Venus' temple stands— Here bring the torches and the brands; Here bring the wrenching-irons and the bows Against obstructing doors, so big with threats and blows. Yet, goddess, of rich Cyprus queen, And Memphis, where no snow is seen, Once gently, with thy long-extended whip, Touch my coquettish Chloe, till you make her skip. ODE XXVII. TO GALATEA, ON POINT TO GO ABROAD. He dissuades her especially from the example of Europa. The screamings of th'ill-omen'd jay, Or pregnant bitch, or fox attend, Or tauny wolf in quest of prey, All wicked wretches on their way, And to their journey's end: Or let a serpent drive them back, The road swift crossing like a dart, And terrify the stumbling hack— For thee I dread no such attack; But with an augur's art, In early pray'r I will apply, That some good-natur'd crow may speed, And leave the east before the cry Of brids that bode a stormy sky, And to their lakes proceed. O Galatea! be thou blest, Where'er you choose to take your rout, And keep my mem'ry in your breast; Nor raven nor the pye molest Your course, as you set out. But look, as he's in haste to set, How prone Orion moves the seas, I well know Adrian's gloomy threat, And how much mischief's to be met From yonder whit'ning breeze. May wives and children of our foes The rising goat's alarm partake; To the black surge themselves expose, Which, roaring to the blast that blows, Makes all the land to quake. Thus did Europa trust, of yore, To that false bull her snowy limbs, And, trembling at her boldness, bore Her midmost course, where, far from shore, Full many a monster swims. She, who of late the meadows knew, Fair student of the flow'ry bloom, Wove chaplets to the wood-nymphs due— Nought now but stars and waves could view, All in the glimm'ring gloom. And when she was arriv'd at Crete, So famous for its hundred towns, O father! lost and indiscrete, The daughter's duty to defeat, She cry'd, in wrath, and frowns. Whence? Whither am I come?—Too light A punishment one death would be— Am I awake, and wail of right? Or is't a vision of the night, And I from baseness free? A vision from the iv'ry gate, Which brings false fancies to the head— Say, was it then a better fate Through the long seas to sail—or wait Where new-blown flow'rs are spread? O if I had th'audacious steer My indignation hates and scorns, I'd kill him with a falchion here, And, though he was of late so dear, Would strive to break his horns. Shameless I left my father's place, Shameless I wait the doom of hell— Ye gods! if any hear my case— O that I naked, in disgrace, Might roam 'mongst lions fell! Before a virulent decay Shall feed upon my blooming cheek, While yet there's moisture in my clay, To be the tyger's tender prey, With all my charms, I seek. Ah base! thy father to offend, Whose passion urges thee to die; Well did thy girdle thee attend— Thyself upon this ash suspend, And with his will comply. Or if, upon the rocks to split, Acute with death, you are inclin'd; To the fierce storm yourself submit— Unless, perhaps, you should think fit To ply a task injoin'd, And live a tyrant's harlot vile, And bear his queen's imperious tongue— Thus, as she urg'd her plaintive stile, Came Venus with perfidious smile, And boy with bow unstrung— Anon, when she had jeer'd enough, She said, forbear your wrath and heat, Since with his horns, though ne'er so tough, This bull shall meet a full rebuff, When you with him shall treat. Do you not know your fame and fort, As matchless Jove's distinguish'd dame— Learn your high dignity at court— And let the quarter'd world support Your story and your name. ODE XXVIII. TO LYDE. He exhorts Lyde to pass the day sacred to Neptune merrily, in drinking and singing. Neptune, on his festal day, How can we so well exalt? Lyde, bring without delay Wine from out our inmost vault; Thus you, with a fresh resource, Wisdom's fort shall reinforce. Don't you see the day decline? Yet, as if the sun would wait, You neglect to bring the wine, Which is of most pleasant date; For when Bibulus signifies a toper. Bibulus was chosê, It was laid to his repose. We will sing alternate lays— Neptune and the Nereids green, I with lively verse will praise— You, Latona, pow'rful queen, And swift-darting Dian's laud, With your twisted lyre applaud. And the end of all to crown, We will chant the queen of smiles, Who with harness'd swans comes down Unto all her fav'rite isles; And as goddess of delight, We will deify the night. ODE XXIX. TO MÆCENAS. He invites him to a chearfal supper, omitting public concerns. O from Tyrrhenian monarchs sprung! This many a season I forbear A cask of mellow wine, untouch'd by tongue, With roses for thy breast, and essence for thy hair. Dispatch—nor Tibur's marshy meads, Nor always Esula admire, Whose sloping soil the eye with verdure feeds, Nor buildings rais'd aloft by Telegonas. him who slew his fire. Leave squeamish plenty, and the pile, Whose structures to the skies presume, And cease to praise in such a pompous style The smoke, and wealth, and clamour of your prosp'rous Rome. 'Tis joy, at times, to shift the scene, As men of wealth and pow'r allow, And without purple carpets neat and clean, The poor man's cottage-treat has smooth'd an anxious brow. Now Cepheus drives his flaming car, Now Procyon's wrath begins to burn; Now the mad lion shews his rampant star, As fiery Phœbus makes the drinking-days return. Now weary to the stream and shade Go shepherds with their languid sheep, Or where Sylvanus spreads his thickest glade, And on the silent bank vague winds are lull'd asleep. What regulations best may suit The state, and for the world you care, What points the Seres, Bactrians would dispute, And what discordant Tanais rises to prepare. Wisely do heav'nly pow'rs th'event Of future times in night suppress, And smile when mortal men are too intent Beyond their reach—Take thought, that moment you possess To husband—As for other cares, As with the streaming river's course Now gliding to the Tuscan sea it fares, Now wave-worn rocks, and trunks up-torn with rapid force, And flocks and houses in its flood Involving, not without the roar Of Echo—mountains and th'adjoining wood, When deluge boils the streams above the peaceful shore. He, master of himself, shall dwell, And in a state of joy subsist, Who every day his heart can fairly tell— “Why this is life.”—To-morrow with a gloomy mist, Or brightness Jove may deck the pole, Yet shall he never take away The past, or with his utmost pow'r controul That bliss, the fleeting hours have ravish'd as their prey. Delighted with her cruel pow'r, Still trifling insolently blind, Fortune shifts short-liv'd honours ev'ry hour, Now good, perhaps, to me, now to another kind. I praise her while I call her mine; But if she spread her wings for flight, Wrapt in my virtue, I her gifts resign, And court ingenuous want, whose portion is her mite. 'Tis not my business, though the mast Should with the southern whirlwinds groan, With wretched pray'rs to deprecate the blast, Lest in the greedy main my bales be overthrown. In such a case, my little boat, For which two oars alone are made, Should bear me through th'Egean dread afloat, Fann'd by the gentle breeze, and safe in Castor's aid. ODE XXX. TO THE MUSE MELPOMENE. Horace has gained eternal glory by his lyric compositions. I've made a monument to pass The permanence of solid brass, And rais'd to a sublimer height Than pyramids of royal state, Which washing rains, or winds that blow With vehemence, cannot o'erthrow: Nor will th'innumerable tale Of years, or flight of time avail. For death shall never have the whole Of Horace, whose immortal soul Shall 'scape the pow'rs of human bane, And for new praise his works remain, As long as priest and silent maid Shall to the Capitol parade; Where Aufidus in rapture goes, And where poor Daunus scarcely flows, Once rural king—I shall be thought The prince of Roman bards, that brought To Italy th'Æolian airs, Advanc'd from want to great affairs. Assume, Melpomene, that pride, Which is to real worth ally'd; And in good-will descending down, With Delphic bays my temples crown. THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ODES OF HORACE. ODE I. TO VENUS. Horace is now arrived to that time of day, when he ought to alienate himself from love affairs, and ludicrous verses. Left alone so long a season, What! again new warfare rage? Spare me, Venus, treason! treason! This is not a lover's age. Now no more my youthful vigour Good queen Cynara inspires— Cease to use thy gentle rigour, Parent fierce of sweet desires. Staid, and void of inclination— Almost fifty—hence depart To the softer invocation Of full many a youthful heart. On more equable condition Drive your purple swans away, And put Paulus in commission At a better time of day. For he's nobly born, and decent, Would you fire a worthy breast? And great instances are recent, How he pleads for the distrest. Youth of most accomplish'd merit, Of an hundred arts and charms— He shall bear with strength and spirit Far and wide thy conqu'ring arms. If he smile at times prevailing O'er a bribing dupe's disgrace, With sweet wood thy bust empaling, He near Alba's lake shall place. Thine indulgent presence thither Shall much frankincense invite, Lyre, and flute, and pipe together Shall thy ravish'd ears delight. Twice a day the lads and lasses There thy praises shall resound, And with foot that snow surpasses, Salian-like, shall shake the ground. ODE II. TO ANTONIUS JULUS, THE SON OF MARK ANTONY, OF THE TRIUMVIRATE. It is hazardous to imitate the ancient poets. Whoever vies with Pindar's strain, With waxen wings, my friend, would fly, Like him who nam'd the glassy main, But could not reach the sky. Cascading from the mountain's height, As falls the river swoln with show'rs, Deep, fierce, and out of measure great His verses Pindar pours. Worthy to claim Apollo's bays, Whether his dithyrambics roll, Daring their new-invented phrase And words, that scorn controul. Or gods he chants, or kings, the seed Of gods, who rose to virtuous fame, And justly Centaurs doom'd to bleed, Or quench'd Chimera's flame. Or champions of th'Elean justs, The wrestler, charioteer records, And, better than a hundred busts, He gives divine rewards. Snatch'd from his weeping bride, the youth His verse deplores, and will display Strength, courage, and his golden truth, And grudges death his prey. The Theban swan ascends with haste, Of heav'n's superior regions free; But I, exactly in the taste Of some Matinian bee, That hardly gets the thymy spoil About moist Tibur's flow'ry ways, Of small account, with tedious toil, Compose my labour'd lays. You, bard indeed! with more applause Shall Cæsar sing, so justly crown'd, As up the sacred hill he draws The fierce Sicambrians bound. A greater and a better gift Than him, from heav'n we do not hold, Nor shall—although the times should shift Into their pristine gold. The festal days and public sports For our brave chief's returning here, You shall recite, and all the courts Of law contentions clear. Then would I speak to ears like thine, With no small portion of my voice, O glorious day! O most divine! Which Cæsar bids rejoice. And while you in procession hie, Hail triumph! triumph! will we shout All Rome—and our good gods supply With frankincense devout! Thee bulls and heifers ten suffice— Me a calf weaned from the cow, At large who many a gambol tries, Though doom'd to pay my vow. Like the new moon, upon his crest He wears a semicircle bright, His body yellow all the rest, Except this spot of white. ODE III. TO MELPOMENE. Horace was born for poetry, to which his immortality is intirely owing. He, on whose natal hour you glance A single smile with partial eyes, Melpomene, shall not advance A champion for th'Olympic prize, Nor drawn by steeds of manag'd pride, In Grecian car victorious ride. Nor honour'd with the Delphic leaf, A wreath for high atchievements wove, Shall he be shewn triumphant chief, Where stands the Capitol of Jove, As justly rais'd to such renown For bringing boastful tyrants down. But pleasing streams, that flow before Fair Tibur's flow'ry-fertile land, And bow'ring trees upon the shore, Which in such seemly order stand, Shall form on that Eolic plan The bard, and magnify the man. The world's metropolis has deign'd To place me with her darling care, Rome has my dignity maintain'd Amongst her bards my bays to wear; And hence it is against my verse The tooth of envy's not so fierce. O mistress of the golden shell! Whose silence you command, or break; Thou that canst make the mute excel, And ev'n the sea-born reptiles speak; And, like the swan, if you apply Your touch, in charming accents die. This is thy gift, and only thine, That, as I pass along, I hear— “There goes the bard, whose sweet design “Made lyricks for the Roman ear.” If life or joy I hold or give, By thee I please, by thee I live. ODE IV. TO THE CITY OF ROME, CONCERNING THE GENIUS OF DRUSUS, AND HIS EDUCATION UNDER AUGUSTUS. As him, by mighty Jove preferr'd On high his thunder-bolts to bear, Deem'd o'er the winged race the sovereign bird, E'er since he made sweet youth, and innocence his care; Of old, green years, but strength innate, Drove him, unskill'd, upon his prey, And vernal winds, the winter out of date, Taught him unwonted flights, but not without dismay, Anon, by vivid impulse sped, He wages war against the folds, And by his lust of fight and plunder led, The curv'd-reluctant snakes within his claws he holds. Or as a goat in pastures green Intent, a lion's tawny whelp (Whom his fierce mother did but lately wean) Eyes rushing with new fangs, and has no hope of help. Such warrior Drusus in his bloom The Rhœtian and North-Alpine band Beheld (which latter whence they did assume With Amanzonian ax long since to arm their hand, I have omitted to declare, Nor can we every matter know) But far and wide victorious as they were, The young man's wondrous conduct taught them at a blow, How a well-bent ingenuous mind, And genius disciplin'd can awe, Whose plan was in a happy school design'd By Cæsar, more than father to his sons-in-law. The brave are gender'd by the brave, This truth ev'n genuine steers attest, The manag'd steeds by progeny behave, Nor are tame turtles hatch'd in yon fierce eagle's nest. Yet learning inward strength assists, And education mans the heart; Refinement by morality exists, Or else good-nature fails for want of wholesome art. What to the Neroes Rome should pay, The loud Metaurus witness bears, And vanquish'd Asdrubal—and that fair day Which clear'd the low'ring gloom from our distress'd affairs. That day, which many a prize renowns, First mention'd victory to gain, When Hannibal fled thro' th'Italian towns, Like wind that sweeps the sea, or fire that takes the train. From this desirable event The Roman enterprizes throve, And ravag'd, where the Punic plund'rers went, The temples stood repair'd in every sacred grove; Until the traitor said at last, “Like stags, of rav'nous wolves the prey, “We follow those heroic bands too fast, “Of whom by craft and flight we solely win the day. “The nation, which from Troy on fire, “Held sacred from their numerous woes, “Brought through the Tuscan seas the son and sire, “In fair Ausonia's towns from shipwreck to repose, “As from the ax the hardy oak, “Which in dark Algidus abounds, “Tho' hurt and damag'd by the frequent stroke, “Thrives, and exalts his head, aspiring by its wounds: “Not more increase did Hydra, maim'd, “Against griev'd Hercules assume, “Nor was or Thebes, nor was ev'n Colchis, fam'd “For prodigies, more great, more wonderful than Rome. “Sunk to the center, they will rise “More fair, and woe to him that strives; “From vet'ran victors they will win the prize, “And send the gallant tale to entertain their wives. “No more my proud couriers I send “To Carthage fall'n, ah fall'n! and fled “Is all our hope; nor fortune is our friend “(Though once she lov'd our name) now Asdrubal is dead.” Nothing so glorious in the field, But Claudius will with ease atchieve; Whom Jove defends, with prudence for his shield, Thro' intricate distress and war his way to cleave. ODE V. TO AUGUSTUS. That he would at length return to Rome. From gods propitious sprung, O guard Of Roman greatness! you retard Now far too long your stay: That promise of a quick return You made the House, no more adjourn, But keep a shorter day. Restore to this thy native place The light, good chief, for when thy face, Like spring, its lustre throws, The day goes off with more content, And in a better firmament A brighter sunshine glows. As for her son a mother's pain'd, Above the destin'd year detain'd, By southern blasts malign, Beyond Carpathian waves profound, Where he continues weather-bound, For his sweet home to pine. With calculations, tears, and sighs, And vows, she calls, nor turns her eyes From off the winding shore; Ev'n with that fondness these desires Cæsar his native land requires, Still wanted more and more. For where you are, the grazing steer Roams o'er the meadows, free from fear, Ceres yields ampler fruit; The sailors plow the peaceful main, And honour, cautious of a stain, Keeps accusation mute. Each house is clear of guilt impure, Example and the laws secure The heart from filthy sin; For penalty sticks close to blame; Our ladies are of peerless fame For children like their kin. The Parthian, or with ice congeal'd Who fears the Scythian in the field, Or who the monstrous host That Germany brings forth and sends, Or who the threats from Spain attends, While Cæsar keeps his post? Each Roman sends the sun to bed On his own hill, and loves to wed To widow'd elms the vine, Thence home at night he goes alert, And thee, as god of his desert, Invites to grace his wine. Thee their incessant pray'rs adore, And large libations on the floor, Are offer'd to thy state; Thou with the houshold-gods art join'd, As Greece her Castor bore in mind, And Hercules the great. Long may'st thou give, O glorious chief! To Rome this leisure and relief, So constant patriots pray; Thus sober in the morn we cry, Thus in the night with bumpers high, When ocean hides the day. ODE VI. TO APOLLO AND DIANA. God, whose dread power the Niobe. Theban queen Felt for her boastings proud and vain, And Tityos ravisher obscene, And Peleus' son, who might have been High Ilion's fatal bane; The soldier, braver than them all, No match for thee was taught to fear, Though him her child did Thetis call, And though he shook the Dardan wall, Arm'd with tremendous spear. As falls to biting steel the pine, Or Cypress to the eastern gust, So he was humbled to resign His life, extended, and recline His neck in Trojan dust. He in no wooden horse disguis'd, For sacred rites of false report, The Trojan dupes would have surpris'd, 'Midst feasts and dances ill-advis'd, In city and at court. But boldly fierce, with open ire, Alas! alas! the dreadful doom Had gratify'd his vengeance dire, And infants burnt with Grecian fire, Ev'n in their mother's womb. If not by thee wrought to relent, And Venus in persuasion skill'd, The sire of gods had giv'n assent That for more fortunate event, Æneas walls should build. O lyrist, with a master's air, By whom the sweet Thalia plays, Which in cool Xanthus lav'st thy hair, Make thou the Daunian muse thy care, Enlightner of our ways. Phœbus, my spirit, taste, and flame, Gives all the gifts that verse adorn; From him I have the poet's name— “Ye virgins of unspotted fame, “And youths most nobly born, “Wards of the Delian maid, so fleet “'Gainst stags and ounces with her bow, “Take notice of the Lesbian feet, “And, as the time you see me beat, “Attend to fast and slow, “Extolling with the ritual praise “Latona's darling in your song, “And her that nightly mends her blaze, “As shedding her fructiferous rays, “She rolls the months along. “Soon when you're marry'd each shall say, “I too was present to rehearse, “Upon that memorable day, “The numbers of th'Horatian lay, “Skill'd in his mystic verse.” ODE VII. TO L. MANLIUS TORQUATUS. All things are changed by time; one ought therefore to live chearfully. The melted snow the verdure now restores, And leaves adorn the trees; The season shifts—subsiding to their shores The rivers flow with ease. The Grace, with nymphs and with her sisters twain, Tho' naked dares the dance— That here's no permanence the years explain, And days, as they advance. The air grows mild with zephyrs, as the spring To summer cedes the sway, Which flies when autumn hastes his fruits to bring, Then winter comes in play. The moons their heav'nly damages supply— Not so the mortal star— Where good Eneas, Tullus, Ancus lie, Ashes and dust we are. Who knows if heav'n will give to-morrow's boon To this our daily pray'r? The goods you take to keep your soul in tune, Shall scape your greedy heir. When you shall die, tho' Minos must acquit A part so nobly play'd; Race, eloquence, and goodness, from the pit Cannot restore your shade. For nor Diana's heav'nly pow'r or love, Hippolytus revives; Nor Theseus can Perithous remove From his Lethean gives. ODE VIII. TO MARTIUS CENSORINUS. There is nothing that can immortalize rather than the works of poets. Goblets to every friend of gold, And statues of Corinthian mould, In gratitude I had bestow'd, Attending to the present mode; And tripods too, which were the mead, That Greece her valiant sons decreed; Nor shou'd you have the meanest prize, Were I enrich'd with such supplies, As Scopas or Parrhasius send, The one his colours skill'd to blend; The one, whose excellence is known To cut a god or man in stone: But I keep no toy-treasures hid, Nor do you want them if I did: Your taste is of a nobler flight, And poetry is your delight; Which I can furnish, and assign The merit of the gift divine. Not marbles, that the public place With long inscriptions on the base, By which returns beyond the grave New life and spirit to the brave; Not Hannibal what time he fled, With threats retorted on his head; Not impious Carthage, all a-flame, To greater brightness raise his name, (Who, when from conquest he return'd, The title Africanus earn'd) Than he, who those achievements sung, Ev'n Ennius from Calabria sprung; Nor, if our writings shou'd be mute, Wou'd benefit receive its fruit. What wou'd the acts of him the son Of Mars, and what had Ilia done; If silence, envious of renown, Had borne their matchless merits down? The virtue, votes, and pow'rful word Of bards, have Eacus transferr'd From Stygian darkness, to the isles Where happiness eternal smiles. The muse excepts against the doom Of meritorious men in Rome. The muse can bless you to the skies— 'Twas thus brave Hercules cou'd rise To taste with Jove, a welcome guest, Celestial fare amongst the rest. 'Tis thus the fam'd twin-stars obtain, To save ships shatter'd on the main; Thus, ivy-crown'd, the god of wine Gives furth'rance to each fair design. ODE IX. TO LOLLIUS. The writings of Horace will never be lost: virtue, without verse, is liable to oblivion. He will sing the praises of Lollius, whose particular excellencies he likewise commemorates. Lest you should think the strains will die, Which I in skill but newly found With voice to correspondent strings ally, Borne where from far the rocks of Aufidus resound. Know, that if Homer take the lead, Yet is not Pindar out of date; Nor Cean nor Alcean fire recede, Nor that Stesichorus. Sicilian bard's authority and weight. Nor if of old Anacreon sung, Has time his sportive lays suppress'd; Alive are all the notes of Sappho's tongue, Which too her lyre she play'd, of genuine warmth possess'd. Helen was not the only fair, That was enamour'd to admire Th'adult'rer's golden garb, and flowing hair, And royal equipage, with all their grand attire. Nor Teucer, from Cydonian string, Was first that with his darts engag'd; Nor Troy but once besieged, nor Cretan king, Nor Sthenelus alone the well-sung contest wag'd. Not Hector, val'rous as he was, Nor fierce Deiphobus begun To bleed and suffer in their country's cause, Or for a virtuous wife, or for a darling son. Before great Agamemnon shone, Heroes there were—but all in night, Long night, are buried, piteous and unknown, For want of sacred bards their glories to recite. Virtue conceal'd is next, I deem, To bury'd sloth—I will not spare For ornament, when Lollius is the theme; Nor suffer so much merit, such a life of care In black oblivion to be hurl'd— You, Lollius, have a noble mind; Skilful and fraught with knowledge of the world, Equal for all events, or temp'rate or resign'd. Of greedy fraud the judge severe, Forbearing all-attractive gold; A consul not elected for a year, But still esteem'd, in fact, that dignity to hold. Where'er the magistrate prefers Things honest to his private ends, And bribing villains with a look deters, And draws against the crowd, and his fair fame defends He is not happy, rightly nam'd, Whom large possessions still increase— By him more truly is that title claim'd, Who holds the gifts divine in prudence and in peace; Who's able hardship to sustain, And dreads vile actions worse than death; He for his friends counts any loss a gain, And for his country's cause will give his dying breath. ODE X. TO PHYLLIS. He invites her to a banquet, upon the birth-day of Mæcenas. Full nine years old my cellar stows A cask of good Albanian wine, And parsley in my garden grows; For Phyllis chaplets to compose, Much ivy too is mine: With whose green gloss you shall be crown'd; With burnish'd plate the house looks gay, The altar, with chaste vervains bound, Craves to be Horace's was a very old altar, so that avet and the obsolete infinitive spargier, are peculiarly happy. sprinkled from the wound, As we the lambkin slay. All hands are busied—here and there Mixt with the lads the lasses fly, The bustling flames, to dress the fare, Roll up thick smoke, which clouds the air Above the roof on high. But would you know what joy resides With me, to tempt you at this time— You are to celebrate the ides, The day which April's month divides, And Venus calls her prime: A feast observable of right, Which I more heartily revere, Than that which brought myself to light, From whence my patron to requite, Flow many a happy year! Young Telephus, at whom you aim, Is not for such as thee at all; A rich and a lascivious dame Upon his love has fixt her claim, And holds him in sweet thrall. Let blasted Phaeton dissuade Presumptuous hope too high to soar; And Bellerophon. he a dread example made By Pegasus, who scornful neigh'd That he a mortal bore. Things worthy of yourself pursue, Nor go where vain desire allures; 'Tis lawless to extend your view To one that's not a match for you— Hail! crown of my amours! For, after this, I will be free From every other flame and fair— Come, learn the song I made for thee, And join, with charming voice and me, To banish gloomy care. ODE XI. TO VIRGIL. He describes the approach of spring, and invites Virgil to an entertainment upon a certain condition. Now the breezes fresh from Thrace, Those attendants on the spring, Still the sea, yet urge the race Of the ships upon the wing: No more the meadows lands are froze, Nor roar the streams o'ercharg'd with snows. Now the bird with mournful scream, Aye for Itys wont to pine, Builds her nest, disgrace extreme Of the great Cecropian line E'er since, that most horrid treat She forc'd the lustful king to eat. Swains the thriving sheep that tend, Thrown upon the mossy sod; With the pipe their verses blend, To divert the rural god: Whom that sweet scene of flocks and hills, In Arcady, with rapture fills. 'Tis the time of drinking hard, But Calenean would you take, You must bring a box of nard, For your entertainment's sake: No less can wealthy Virgil frank, As tutor to our youths of rank. E'en an ounce of that perfume, Shall a special cask intice; Which in the Sulpician room Now sleeps clear of noise and vice: Fraught with new hopes of cleansing pow'r, Against the bitter and the sour. To these pleasures if you haste, You must enter with your fee; You shall not my goblets taste, By my inclination, free: As in the rich man's house you fare, Without contributing your share. But, my Virgil, lay aside All delay and thirst of gain; While 'tis lawful to provide, 'Gainst the seats of death and pain: Let mirth relieve each grave concern, For folly's pleasant in it's turn. ODE XII. UPON LYCE, AN ANTIQUATED COURTEZAN. He insults her with extreme bitterness; that now being old, and yet retaining her lustful appetite, she is contemned by the young gallants. Lyce, the gods my vows have heard, At length they've heard my vows; You wou'd be beauteous with a beard, You romp and you carouse: And drunk, with trembling voice, you court Slow Cupid, prone to seek For better music, bloom, and sport, In buxom Chia's cheek. For he, a sauce-box, scorns dry chips, And teeth decay'd and green; Where wrinkled forehead, and chapt lips, And snowy hairs are seen. Nor Coan elegance, nor gems, Your past years will restore; Which time to his records condemns, With fleeting wings of yore. Ah! where's that form, complexion, grace, That air—where is she, say, That cou'd my sick'ning soul solace, And stole my heart away? Blest! who cou'd Cynara succeed, As artful and as fair— But fate, to Cynara, decreed Few summers for her share. That crow-like Lyce might survive, 'Till lads shou'd laugh and shout, To see the torch, but just alive, So slowly stinking out. ODE XIII. TO AUGUSTUS. Honours, adequate to the merits of Augustus, cannot be attributed by the Roman senate and people. What can the conscript fathers do, Or Romans join'd, with all their souls; To give th'Augusten worth the honours due, Grav'd on eternal brass, or written in the rolls. O thou, the most illustrious prince, Wheree'r the sun the world illumes; 'Twas thine the rough north Alpines to convince, What dignity of rank your martial fame assumes. For by your troops did Drusus rout The fierce Genaunians, Brennians keen And, more than once, raz'd many a strong redoubt They pil'd upon the Alps tremendous to be seen. Anon, the elder Nero fought A dreadful fight with your success; And drove th'enormous Rhetians, quick as thought, From ev'ry post of war they ventur'd to possess. Nero, a glorious sight to see, How he bore down the mighty bane Of souls, resolv'd to die or to be free, Ev'n as the south attacks the ocean's proud disdain, While Pleiad, and her sisters, cleave The clouds, the furious victor sped Thro' midmost fire, the murm'ring troops to grieve, And with his warrior horse ev'n there the troops to head. As Aufidus, that rolls before Appulian Daunus, is in scorn; And, like the meadow's lord, augments his roar, And meditates vastation to the fields of corn. Thus Claudius, thro' each iron rank Of these barbarians, forc'd renown; And, charging first and hindmost, front and flank, Victorious, without loss, he mow'd their armies down. With thine advice, and prosp'rous fates— For, on that memorable day, When suppliant Alexandria ope'd her gates, With nought within her courts but terror and dismay. Before the fifteen years ran out, Fortune successful in the end The glory, so long wish'd for, brought about, And made th'imperial arms their final pow'r extend. Cantabrians, unsubdu'd till now, Medes, Indians, with submissive mien; Thee the vague Scythian honour and allow, Guard of the Latian name, and Rome the world's great queen. Thee Nilus, that conceals his fount, Thee Danube, rapid Tigris fear; Thee the swoln waves, on which such monsters mount, 'Till British cliffs, remote, the horrid bellowing hear. The region of th'intrepid Gaul, And all Iberia's harden'd race; And thee, their lord, the tam'd Sicambrians call, And, bloody, as they were, thy terms of peace embrace. ODE XIV. THE PRAISES OF AUGUSTUS. Willing to sing upon my lyre, The fights we dare, the tow'rs we scale; Apollo bade me check my fond desire, Nor on the vast Tyrrhenian spread my little fail. Cæsar, in this thy better age, Again the fertile fields have throve; And from proud Parthia's fanes thy godlike rage, Our standards has retook, and giv'n to Roman Jove. And Janus' temple too is clos'd, Good order from the peace deriv'd; And curbs upon licentiousness impos'd, Have banish'd vice afar, and ancient arts reviv'd. From which the Latin name and strength Of Italy are so increast, And our imperial glory, breadth and length, From the sun's western bed have reach'd remotest east. While Cæsar the dominion claims, Nor civil rage nor active spite, Can take us from our peace; nor wrath, whose flames Forge hostile sounds, and states in friendship disunite. Not those that in deep Danube lave, Shall now the Julian edicts scorn; Nor Getans, Seres, or the treach'rous slave Of Persia, nor the folk upon the Tanais born. And we on work and festal days, Amidst our cups of jovial wine; With wives and children (first with pray'r and praise, Having made application to the pow'rs divine) Will, like our sires, in songs of joy, With many a Lydian air between, Sing our accepted chiefs Anchises, Troy, And those descendant heirs of love's indulgent queen. THE BOOK OF THE EPODES OF HORACE. EPODE I. TO MÆCENAS. Horace will accompany Mæcenas, going to the Actium expedition against Antony. In a small ship, my friend, You soon your course shall bend, To face huge vessels tow'ry-stern'd; Prepar'd to undergo All perils of the foe, For Cæsar, as thyself concern'd. And what will come of me, For life is sweet with thee, But on the contrary severe: What must I peace pursue, As so enjoin'd by you, Peace is not peace if you're not here! Or shall I danger dare, Altho' forbid my share Of bold adventure in the van: With that degree of heart, As best beseems the part, Of him that acts up to the man? Yes, yes I will sustain Each ill of land or main, Fell Caucasus, or Alpine snows; Far as remotest west, With thee my manly breast, I will to ev'ry foe oppose. Perhaps you are to seek, How timorous and weak, I with my aid could help you out; I answer, “less the fear, “To persons that are near— “Absence and distance heighten doubt?” As when she leaves her young, The serpent's forked tongue, The bird will fear with more of dread; Not that her presence there, Could save her callow care, Or stave destruction from their head. With pleasure for your sake, This voyage would Horace make, Or any journey or campaign; Without a view to bow, More steers to pull my plough, Upon a more extensive plain. Or from Calabria's mead, To turn my flock to feed, Lucania's marsh when summer reigns; Or spread my marble cot, To that ambitious spot, Which Circe's title still retains. Your bounty is my store, Enough for me, and more— I will not for myself provide; What, like a rake in taste, I might profusely waste, Or like penurious Chremes hide. EPODE II. THE PRAISES OF A COUNTRY LIFE. A happy man is he, From business far and free, Like mortals in the golden days; With steers at his command, To till his father's land, Whom int'rest neither plagues nor sways. Him no dread trump alarms, To take the soldiers arms, Nor need he fear the stormy main; The noisy bar he shuns, Nor to the levy runs Of men, whose station makes them vain. Wherefore he rather joins, The marriageable vines, To poplars tall in many a row; Or prunes each fruitless shoot, That springs to bear no fruit, And bids the happier tendrils grow. Or takes a distant gaze Of lowing herds, that graze As in the valley's mead they roam; Or steer his tender flock, Or in the cleanly crock, Lays up press'd honey from the comb. But when Autumnus comes, With apples mild and plumbs, That his delightful aspect crown; What joy to pluck the pear, He grafted with such care, And grape of more than purple down. With gifts select as these, Priapus to appease, Or Sylvan, that his bounds defends; Now thrown beneath a bough Of aged oak, and now On matted grass his limbs extends. Mean while the streams beside, In their deep channel glide, And birds within the leafy glade Upon the branches sing, With bubbling fountains spring, The gentlest slumbers to persuade. But when the troubled air Is alter'd, to prepare The seasons of the snows and wet; With hounds on ev'ry hand, The wild boar is trepann'd, Into the interruping net. Or with smooth-shaven stakes, A slender toil he makes, Where greedy thrushes are his prey; Or tim'rous hare is ginn'd, Or stranger cranes are thinn'd The pleasant prizes of the day. 'Mong'st joys so sweet to thought, Who does not set at nought, All love's anxieties and cares; But chiefly if a wife, Of chaste and virtuous life, Help in the family affairs. Such as the Sabine dames, Or tann'd by solar flames, Such as the swift Apulian's spouse; Soon as her lord returns, Fatigu'd with what he earns, On sacred dearth the fire to rouse. And when the kine she's got, Within the hurdled spot, She milks their swelling udders dry; And bringing this year's wine, From hogshead sweet and fine, A gratis feast she can supply. Not oysters fetch'd from far, Or turbot or the scar, If a bad wind so well should blow; To send them from the East, To deck a Roman feast, And on our shores their shoals bestow. Not bustards, or the game Of Asia would I claim, In preference my taste to please; As olives, nicely chose From out the special rows Of fittest and most healthy trees: Or sorrel, goodly weed, That loves the verdant mead, Or mallow sov'reign cure esteem'd; Or lamb, which on the day Of Terminus we slay, Or kid just from the wolf redeem'd. How sweet, amidst this cheer, To see the sheep appear, Return'd and sated to the full; Th'inverted plough to see, Which oxen o'er the lea, With languid neck at leisure pull. To see the servants swarm, As into ranks they form, To keep the merry house alive; The smiling gods to bless For all this good success, By which they and their master thrive. This speech when Alphius made, That, broker of such trade, Commencing rustic without doubt; For all his cash he drew Then the first wind that blew, He chang'd his mind and put it out. EPODE III. TO MÆCENAS. He expresses his aversion to garlic, which he eat at Mæcenas's house, and with which he was tortured in the bowels. Has any young profligate been so perverse, To slay his old grandsire in wrath; Why let him eat garlick (not hemlock is worse) What stomachs have clowns to their broth? O what is this poison that's burning within? Has venom of vipers infus'd Deceiv'd me! or, as the reward of my sin, Canidia the viands abus'd! Medea, beyond all the Argonaut wights, When she captain Jason bespoke; She made him take this as an unction of nights, Before the wild bulls cou'd be broke. With this she prepar'd certain presents she made, A desp'rate revenge in her view; And having Creusa to take them betray'd, Away on her dragon she flew. Sure ne'er on the thirsty Apulia before, Arose such a muggy offence; Nor did the gift-shirt that poor Hercules wore, Stick closer or burn more intense. If ever such stuff you again shou'd affect, With a trick and a jest in your head; May your wife, hand to mouth, your fond kisses reject, Or lie on the post of the bed. EPODE IV. TO VOLTEIUS MENA. A freed man of Pompey the Great. Not wolves and lambs, by stronger fate Than thou and I each other hate; O hamper'd with th'Iberian cord! And galling fetters of thy lord! What tho' you strut puff'd up with pelf, That cannot change thy servile self. As on the sacred way you sweep, With flowing robes full six ells deep; Ingenuous scorn do you not trace, In crowds that turn away their face! “That wretch, corrected to the quick, “Until the officer was sick; “E'en he retains, in his own hand,— “A thousand rood,—Falernan land;— “And on the Appian road proceeds, “Which he wears out with gallant steeds; “And sits the first at any sight, “In spite of Otho, as a knight. “Wherefore so many beaks of brass, “And heavy hulks do we amass; “'Gainst pyrates, and the servile band, “With such a fellow in command!” EPODE V. UPON CANIDIA THE SORCERESS. “But oh, ye pow'rs on high, “Whichever from the sky, “Rul'st human nature, land and sea; “What can this horrid scene, “These screams and aspects mean, “All, all so sourly fix'd on me! “Thee therefore I implore, “If ever child you bore, “Lucina present to your pray'r; “By this vain The prælexta, which young noblemen wore, was ornamented with purple; for the lad here introduced is supposed to be of rank, in order to aggravate Canidia's barbarity. purple vest, “By Jove, who must detest, “And cannot such proceedings spare! “Why does your forehead low'r “On me, with looks as sour “As step-dames on their sons-in-law; “Or like wild beasts, that feel “The torment of the steel, “Which from their sides they cannot draw?” When thus, in trembling mood, The boy had spoke,—he stood, Of all his noble robes undrest; A tender form and smooth And sight enough to sooth The fierceness of a Thracian breast. Canidia, with her hair Unkempt, as twisted there, The little snakes infold her head; Commands the bastard-fig, That from the graves they dig, And cypress sacred to the dead: And eggs bedaub around, From black toad's filthy wound, And plumes from owl of nightly scream; With drugs Iolchos sends, And which Iberia vends, Whose lands with plenteous poison teem: And bone, that's snatch'd in spite From bitch of greedy bite, When hungry and about to dine; For all these things, the dame Prepares a Colchan flame, The magic powder to combine. But Sagana, with gown Adjusted, up and down Is sprinkling the avernal dew; With hair that stands again, Like urchins of the main, Or running boar that hounds pursue. Veia, without controul Of conscience, digs a hole, And groans at the severe employ Of sharp laborious spade, That, when the pit was made, Therein confin'd the buried boy Might famish at the look, Of dainties that they cook, And vary thrice a day the board;— His body hid as far In earth, as swimmers are In streams, when to their chin they ford. That his exhausted pith, And liver dry therewith, For a love-potion might suffice; When settled on the food, They baffle and elude, The wasting pupils of his eyes. That Folia too did come, E'en from Ariminum, With lust of masculine excess; In towns both small and great, As well as in the prate Of idle Naples was the guess. A witch, whose magic art, Can make the stars to start, At sounds Thessalian, from their spheres; And lunar orb can force, To quit her heav'nly course, When her inchanting voice she hears. Canidia then in dumps, Biting, with her green stumps, Her thumb, whose nail was never par'd; What said she, or what not? “O, conscious on the spot, “Of all these deeds that we have dar'd. “Dian and night serene, “That rule the silent scene, “What time our mystic blazes burn;— “Now, now present your face, “And on each hostile place, “Your pow'r and your resentment turn. “In gloomy glades of dread, “While now wild beasts are sped, “Indulging as they sweetly doze; “Set all the dogs to bark, “At yon old lech'rous spark, “And to the gen'ral laugh expose. “With nard, bedaub'd as rich “As essences, the which “These toiling hands of mine distill;— “Hah! what does magic ail! “Why do these charms avail! “Less than the fell Medea's skill! “With which empower'd to sate “Her vengeance, wrath, and hate, “Great Creon flying she defy'd; “And with her poison'd cloak, “Consum'd in fire and smoak, “Creusa, Jason's other bride. “Yet neither herb nor root, “Of magical repute, “Have scap'd me by their craggy site;— “He sleeps in beds perfum'd, “By harlots thither doom'd, “Thoughtless of me to pass the night. “Ah! ah! he walks at large, “And has his free discharge, “Fresh from a greater wheedler's arms; “Varus, I will pursue, “O wretch about to rue, “Pursue thee with unheard of charms. “Again, for me inclin'd, “You shall return, nor find “Your poor lost wits by Marsian spells; “A greater, greater bane, “Of philters will I strain, “The more your nice disgust rebels. “And sooner heav'n shall go, “To place itself below “The sea, with earth upon the stars; “Then you shall not desire, “My love with such a fire, “As burns this pitch within the bars.” At this the boy no more Intreated, as before, The impious hags with gentle tone;— But doubtful, where to make His preface, thus he spake The curse Thyestes well might own. “Your poys'nous drugs are strong, “Confounding right and wrong, “Yet nature cannot be destroy'd; “Such curses I will urge, “No sacrifice can purge, “And no atonement render void. “And when I shall expire, “So destin'd by your ire, “I'll be a fury in the dark; “And with my crooked claws, “I'll come to maim your jaws, “(Such pow'r have ghosts) with many a mark. “And lying on your breast, “I will deprive of rest “Your eyes, by filling them with fear; “And crowds, from town to town, “Shall join to knock you down, “Obscene old witches, far and near. “Your bodies after all, “Depriv'd of funeral, “Wolves and Esquilian birds shall share; “Your horrors and your cries, “My parents ears and eyes, “Shall glut, surviving me their heir.” EPODE VI. AGAINST CASSIUS SEVERUS. An abusive and petulant Poet. Why innocent visitors do you molest, 'Gainst wolves, a base mongrel, thou cur; Come here, if you chuse it, and snarl out your best, For the kick and the bite I confer. For like a staunch mastiff, or guard of the sheep, A Spartan in colour and breed; Thro' the snows, ears erect, be they never so deep, I will urge all wild beasts that precede. You, when with fierce barking you fill'd all the field, Kept smelling at bones on your plate;— Have a care, have a care, of the weapon I wield, For villains exasp'rate my hate. Like him false Lycambes despis'd for a son, Or he that made Bupalus die; Shall I, when such mischief's by virulence done, Do nought but be boyish and cry? EPODE VII. TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE. His detestation of the civil war carried on the one side by Brutus and Cassius, and on the other by Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus. Where are you rushing on with impious guilt, And hands upon the sheathed swords again; Is there too little blood profusely spilt, Of Romans on the land and in the main? And this—not that our army to the ground, With flames invidious Carthage should deface; Or that unconquer'd Britons, tied and bound, Shou'd up the sacred hill the triumph grace. But that our Rome, to please the Parthian foe, By her own prowess shou'd be undermin'd; A folly neither wolves nor lions know, Save against beasts of a discordant kind. Madness or mettle, or does vice prevail! Give instant answer—what can be the cause! They're silent, and their cheeks are deadly pale, As with intense stupidity they pause. Know then fatality severe, and dread With conscious guilt of fratricide's our own; E're since the blood of harmless Rhemus shed, Was left for his descendants to atone. EPODE VIII. TO MÆCENAS. He has a foretaste of that pleasure, which he shall perceive from Augustus his victory over Antony and Cleopatra. What day, my blest knight, in your lofty saloon, This Cæcuban hoarded for thee; (At Cæsar's great conquest my spirits in tune) Shall Jove for our banquet decree? While Doric and Phrygian concertos are play'd, Upon the shrill pipes and the lyre; As lately when Neptune's Young Pompey, upon the strength of his father's naval atchievements, called himself the son of Neptune. sham-son was dismay'd, And fled with his ships all a-fire. But first he had threaten'd all Rome to subdue, Till to the same yoke they shou'd bend He took from the slaves to their masters untrue, Professing himself for their friend. Yet still cou'd a Roman, whom frail beauty charms, (The fact may our children gainsay) Most slavishly bear palisadoes and arms, And e'en haggar'd eunuchs obey! Amidst all the standards (O shame to be told) That in gallant order arose; The sun a rich canopy blush'd to behold, With squabs for luxurious repose. The Gaul upon this, with two thousand fine horse, For Cæsar with shoutings decreed; And their navy's left wing, struck with dread and remorse, To port made the best of their speed. O triumph! you loiter the heifer to bring, You loiter to bring the gilt car; O triumph! you brought us Jugurtha the king, But Cæsar's inferior by far. Nor, from that long African war, did you crown A chief of more excellent name; Tho' Scipio has got him eternal renown, By Carthage the tomb of his fame. Our enemies, vanquish'd by land and by sea, Have strip'd their red coats from their back; And with the most dismal event to agree, Have cloath'd all their soldiers in black. And Antony now is a making for Crete, (An hundred fair cities she boasts) Or is on the Syrtes wind-bound with his fleet, Or on some strange region he coasts. Bring, boy, larger glasses, with Chian replete, Or fill'd with right Lesbian wine; Or Cæcuban, which may this sickness defeat, Give always good measure for mine! For anxious concern for great Cæsar's affairs, Which each honest citizen racks; 'Tis better with wine (as your Horace declares) With the very best wine to relax. EPODE IX. AGAINST MÆVIUS THE POET. Horace wishes he may be ship-wrecked. The ship ill-omen'd puts to sea, With fœtid Mævius 'mongst the crew; Good blust'ring south remember me, And with rough waves her course pursue. And fore and aft her sides assail, Let east, the wind of black despair With floods turn'd upside down prevail, And oars and ropes in pieces tear. Let north too rage, from mountains high, As when the trembling oaks are rent; Nor friendly star a ray supply, Upon Orion's dread descent. No gentler breeze their fleet convoy, Than what the conq'ring Grecians knew; When Pallas turn'd her rage from Troy On Ajax, as the ruffian's due. O how your sailors toil and curse, What woeful paleness in your cheeks; What pray'rs to Jupiter averse, And what extreme unmanly shrieks. When roaring to the dark south-west, The shallows of th'Ionian bay Shall leave your mastless deck distress'd, And break your very keel away. But if, upon the winding shore, Your foulness shall the gulls delight; With kid and lamb I will adore The tempests, as denouncing right. EPODE X. TO PETTIUS, A BON-COMPANION OF HIS. O Pettius, I delight no more To scribble verses, as of yore, With am'rous pains enslav'd; This third December now has stole The leaves from Sylvan, since my soul For fair Inachia rav'd. Ah me! for I'm asham'd of that, How much I've fill'd the common chat, And for their feasts I grieve; Where listlessness and silence spoke The lover, and such sighs I broke, As I cou'd hardly heave. And oft to you I wou'd complain, How the poor man's ingenious vein, With fortune had no share; Soon as the frontless God of wine, Had wrought upon this breast of mine, To lay its secrets bare. But if a manly scorn prevail, To give these love-tricks to the gale, Which fan, not sooth the flame; Then that false shame shall be a jest, Of coming off the second best, With men of greater name. When thus pot-valiant and austere, This speech I cited in your ear— Advis'd to clear the coast; I stagger'd homewards, to attack My fair-one's door, and broke my back And ribs against the post. EFODE XI. TO HIS HUMOUROUS FRIENDS, THAT THEY WOULD PASS THE WINTER MERRILY. The skies with horrid tempests frown, And even in snow and rain come down, The woods and rough profound Roar with the north wind, fresh from Thrace, My friends let us the hint embrace, And while our knees are sound Let us in seemly sort preclude The thought of sour solicitude,— Bring wine of Manlian date;— All other matters we forbear, For heav'n, perhaps, these hours of care, With joy shall reinstate. Now is the pleasure and the time, With odours of the Persian clime, Our bodies to perfume; And with the Cyllenean lyre, To ease our breast of horrors dire, Lest they our frames consume. Thus the great Centaur to his ward, Sung lectures, “O unconquer'd lord, “Whose birth from Thetis rose; “The land of Phrygia thee expects, “Where cool Scamander's stream directs “Its course, and Simois flows. “From whence (the fates have spun it so) “You shall not be allow'd to go “Home with your blue-ey'd queen; “There thou the ills of every day, “With musick and with wine, allay “Th'alloquial charms of spleen.” EPODE XII. TO MÆCENAS. Taken up with his love for Phryne, he cannot finish the promised Iambics. Why these lethargic fits, Have wrought upon my wits, And in oblivion sunk each sense; As I had drank too deep Of Lethe, bringing sleep With greediness of thirst intense. Mæcenas, candid knight, Your questions kill me quite;— The God of love has un-bespoke The strains I promis'd you, Nor may I them review, Nor give the master's final stroke. You too are all aflame, And by as bright a dame As fir'd the tow'rs of Troy—rejoice— Me Phryne, just made free, Wounds; tho', for more than me, She gives her person and her voice. EPODE XIII. TO HIS MISTRESS NEÆRA Of whose perjury he makes complaint. It was a midnight scene, When Luna shone serene, Midst stars in lesser order trib'd; When you, about to break The league of Gods, didst speak The form of words that I prescrib'd. And round my neck you flung Your pliant arms, and clung With more tenacious fond embrace; Than to the lofty oak The ivy—while you spoke, And vow'd your vow upon the place. “While wolf the lamb devours, “And while Orion low'rs “On sailors in the wintry sea; “And while Apollo's hair, “Flows to the sportive air, “This love of ours shou'd mutual be!” O nymph about to pine, For these resolves of mine; For if my manhood yet remain, I will no rival bear, Neæra's bed to share, But love shall seek for love again. Nor will I re-commence With her, who gave offence, My flame with any new desire; When once the rankling smart, Has setled in my heart, And fix'd me in determin'd ire. But you, whoe'er you are, Of more propitious star, That strut'st triumphant o'er my woe; Tho' rich in land and stock, And by your feeding flock, For thee in gold Pactolus flow. Tho' thou canst con each page, Of that transmuted sage, Than Nireus handsomer appear; Yet thou shalt soon lament, A similar event, And I in turn shall laugh and sneer. EPODE XIV. TO THE PEOPLE OF ROME. His commiseration with the Republic on account of the civil wars. Another age our civil wars compleat, And Rome is ruin'd by her own strong hand; Whom nor the neighb'ring Marsians cou'd defeat, Nor threat'ning Porsena's Etruscan band. Nor Spartacus, nor Capua's rival boasts, Nor innovating Allobrox cou'd worst; Nor rough Germania, with her blue-ey'd hosts, Nor Hannibal by Roman parents curst. But we destroy her, the vile race she bred, And beasts again shall seize upon the ground; Barbarian chiefs shall on her ashes tread, And with their horses hoofs her streets shall sound. And Romulus his bones (dread sight to see!) They shall disperse now kept from wind and sun; Perhaps you all, or a majority, Wou'd learn which way this dire distress to shun. No better scheme than those Phoceans chose, And execrating did their place forsake; And left fields, houses, temples for their foes, And for the bears or rav'nous wolves to take. To go where'er our feet, where'r the wind Or south or rude south-west shall us convey; Can any a more apt expedient find, The voyage looks fair, why do we yet delay? But let us first to these conditions swear, That stones shall swim emerging from the deep; Or Po, ere any to return shall dare, Matinian summits in his streams shall steep. And to the main high Apennine remove, And join new monsters in the lustful fit; Until the kite adulterate the dove, And to the stags the tigresses submit. Nor tawny lion the weak flocks elude, And shaven goats in the salt wave delight; This, and whate'er assertion may preclude, Our sweet return let us, all Rome, recite. All go,—at least the more ingenuous part, The soft and hopeless on their couches lie;— But cease effeminate grief each noble heart, And fly the Tuscan shores, set sail and fly. Circumfluent ocean waits us,—steer the fleet To plains, the happy plains and blessed isle; Where earth untill'd each year supplies the wheat, And undrest vine-trees wear a lasting smile. Her bud the never-failing olive fills, And the black figs their native branches grace;— From hollow oaks flows honey,—and the rills Down lofty mountains leap with tinkling pace. She-goats, unbidden, seek the milk-pail there, And kindly flocks, full-udder'd, homeward speed; Nor round the sheep-coat growls the ev'ning bear, Nor adders lurk beneath th'unshaven mead! And still on stronger beauties shall we gaze, How the dank east nor lays the bearded ears; Nor the fat glebe is burnt by torrid rays, Earth temper'd by the sov'reign of the spheres. This place the vessel Argo ne'er found out, Nor impudent Medea ever knew; Nor here Sidonian sailors tack'd about, Nor here Laertes son's laborious crew. No murrain hurts the cattle, nor by heat Of starry influence are the flocks destroy'd; Jove did these stores for pious souls secrete, When he the golden age with brass alloy'd. The golden age he first alloy'd with brass, With iron next he made the times more hard; Whence, for good Romans, there shall come to pass A sure escape, if Horace be a bard. EPODE XV. TO CANIDIA. He begs of her that she would forgive him, and feigns himself to be over-powered by her magic. At length to scientific charms I yield, whose force my heart alarms, And suppliant pray thee by the reign Of Proserpine and Dian's fane, Whose pow'r's inexorably fierce, And by the books of magic verse, That make the very stars descend From heav'n, and cite them to attend.— No more in cursed mumblings deal, But backward turn th'electric wheel; The son of Thetis, when implor'd By Telephus, the man restor'd; Tho' he with darts oppos'd his way, And set his Mysians in array. The corse of Hector meant a feast, For dogs and ev'ry bird and beast; The Trojan matrons cou'd acquire, For unction and the fun'ral pyre; When Priam went, and (hard to tell!) Before the stern Achilles fell; The crew of Ulysses. that laborious sage, Cou'd from their bodies disengage The bristles of the filthy swine, Soon as sooth'd Circe gave the sign; At which their voice and mind, and hue She did recover and renew: O lov'd by tars and factors, sure Enough thou'st giv'n me to endure; My youthful strength and colour's flown, With ghastly skin on ev'ry bone; My hair is with your unguents hoar, My ceaseless toils are more and more; Day urges night and night the day, Nor can my gasping vitals play; Wherefore I wretched have comply'd, To own what I before deny'd; That Sabine charms the breast can pain, And Marsian dirges split the brain; What wou'd you more, O earth and sea, I burn to a more fierce degree Than Hercules, what time he wore The shirt besmear'd with Nessus' gore; More fierce than those Sicilian fires, Whose wrath from Etna still aspires: For you your Colchian flames prepare, Till, burnt to ash, I float in air. What costs? What issue have you plann'd? Speak out, I'll answer your demand, Ready to give whate'er you chuse— An hundred oxen, or my muse, If on the lying lyre you please, To hear such compliments as these. “You, chaste and good, shall set and rise, “With golden stars that range the skies:” Castor and he, the other twin, Tho' wroth about their sister's sin; O'ercome by pray'r, restor'd the light To Stesichorus, who had defamed Helen with scandalous verses, was deprived of sight; but afterwards restored, by the divine power of Castor and Pollux. him they had depriv'd of sight: And thou (for you can do the feat) Loose me from this delirious heat. O thou ne'er stain'd by parents mean, And clear of the sepulchral scene; A prudent woman, that will spare The nine-days-buried ashes there; You have an hospitable heart, Pure hands—can do a mother's part; And tho' you shou'd be brought to bed, Preserve your strength, your white and red. EPODE XVI. CANIDIA'S ANSWER In which she shews that she cannot be pacified by any intreaties, because the poet has made her magical proceedings public. Why sue your pray'rs to her that mocks, With listless ears not beaten rocks; Where waves the wint'ry Neptune throws, More deaf attend the sailor's woes. What, unreveng'd, Cotyttian rites, Which, sacred to luxurious nights, Do all free intercourse indulge, Shall you deride and you divulge; And with my name the city fill, As priest of our Esquilian still? What profit, that Pelignian dames Are richer from my chymic flames; And that quick poison I contrive, If thou'rt against my wish alive? An irksome life thou shall retain, For fresh and for perpetual pain. Still pining at the dainty meats, For ease false Tantalus intreats; Prometheus, whom the vultur gnaws, Wou'd also have his torments pause; His stone too Sisyphus wou'd prize, Up the high hill; but Jove denies; To leap from tow'rs on earth beneath, Or in your breast the sword to sheathe. Now will you wish, and now will try, The rope about your neck to tye;— All this thou shalt attempt in vain, Thro' tedious grief and sour disdain;— Mean time I'll on your shoulder ride, 'Till earth shall scarce support my pride: Shall I (as you who pry'd can prove) Who make the waxen statues move; The moon can draw from out her course, By words of sympathetic force; Can raise burnt bodies out of Styx, And in the cup love-potions mix; Shall I my fruitless art bemoan, Without effect on Thee alone? THE SECULAR ODE For the safety of the Roman empire. Phœbus and Dian, queen of bow'rs, Bright grace of Heav'n, the things we pray; O most adorable of pow'rs, And still by adoration ours, Grant us this sacred day. At which the Sybils in their song, Ingenuous youths and virgins warn; Selected from the vulgar throng, The gods, to whom sev'n hills belong, With verses to adorn. O fost'ring god, whose fall or flame, Can hide the day or re-illume; Which com'st another and the same, May'st thou see nothing like the fame, And magnitude of Rome! And thou, to whom the pray'r's preferr'd, The matrons in their throes to ease; O let our vows in time be heard, Whether Lucina be the word, Or genial goddess please. Make fruitful ev'ry nuptial bed, And bless the conscript father's scheme, Enjoining bloomy maids to wed, And let the marriage-bill be sped, With a new race to teem. That years elev'n times ten come round, These sports and songs of grave delight; Thrice by bright day-light may resound, And where the thickest crouds abound, Thrice in the welcome night. And you, ye destinies, sincere To sing what good our realm awaits; Let peace establish'd persevere, And add to them, which now appear, Still hope of better fates. Let fertile earth, for flocks and fruit, Greet Ceres with a wheaten crown; And ev'ry youngling, sprout, and shoot, Let Jove with air attemper'd suit, While wholesome rains come down. Serene, as when your darts you sheathe, Phœbus, the suppliant youths befriend; And all the vows the virgins breathe, Up to thy crescent from beneath, Thou, queen of stars, attend. If Rome be yours, and if a band Of Trojans safely came by sea; To coast upon th'Etrurian strand, And change their city and their land, By your supreme decree. For whom, unhurt, thro' burning Troy The chaste Æneas way cou'd find; He whom the foes could not destroy, But liv'd to make his friends enjoy, More than they left behind. —Ye gods, our youth in morals train, With sweet repose old age solace; On Rome, in general, O rain All circumstance, increase, and gain, Each glory and each grace. And he whose beeves were milky white, When to your shrine his pray'rs appeal'd; Of Venus and Anchises hight, O let him reign supreme in fight, But mild to them that yield. By sea and land, the Parthians now Our arms and ax with dread review; For terms of peace the Scythians bow, And, lately arrogant of brow, To us the Indians sue. Now public faith and honour dare, With ancient modesty and peace; To shew their heads, and virtue rare, And she that's wont her horn to bear, With plentiful increase. The archer with his shining bow, The seer that wins each muse's heart; Phœbus, who respite can bestow, To limbs in weakness and in woe, By his salubrious art. If, built on Palatine, the height Of his own towrs his eyes engage; The Roman and the Latian state, Extend he to a longer date, And still a better age! And may Diana, who controuls Mount Algidus and Aventine; To those great men that keep the rolls, And to the youths that lift their souls, A gracious ear incline! That Jove, and all the gods, will bless Our pray'rs, good hope my thoughts forebode; THE CHORUS, who such skill possess, Phœbus and Dian to address, In this thanksgiving ode. ? Ego diis amicum Reddidi carmen docilis modorum Vetis Horatî.In order to exercise the student in the Horatian measures, and at the same time (as I trust) to give him no mean entertainment, I have subjoined my translation of Mr. Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's day, written when I was a youth, and for which I had the honour of a very handsome letter of thanks from that celebrated Author. ODE ON SAINT CECILIA'S DAY I. Descend, ye nine! descend and sing; The breathing instruments inspire, Wake into voice each silent string, And sweep the sounding lyre! In a sadly-pleasing strain, Let the warbling lute complain: Let the loud trumpet sound, 'Till the roofs all around The shrill echoes rebound: While in more lengthen'd notes and slow, The deep, majestic, solemn organs blow. Hark! the numbers, soft and clear, Gently steal upon the ear; Now louder, and yet louder rise, And fill with spreading sounds the skies; Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes, In broken air, trembling, the wild music floats; 'Till by degrees, remote and small, The strains decay, And melt away, In a dying, dying fall. II. By music minds an equal temper know, Nor swell too high, nor sink too low. If in the breast tumultuous joys arise, Music her soft assuasive voice applies; Or when the soul is press'd with cares, Exalts her in enliv'ning airs. Warriors she fires with animated sounds; Pours balm into the bleeding lover's wounds; Melancholy lifts her head, Morpheus rouses from his bed, Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes, List'ning envy drops her snakes: Intestine war no more our passions wage, And giddy factions hear away their rage. III. But when our country's cause provokes to arms, How martial music every bosom warms! So when the first bold vessel dar'd the seas, High on the stern the Thracian rais'd his strain, While Argo saw her kindred trees Descend from Pelion to the main: Transported demi-gods stood round, And men grew heroes at the sound, Enflam'd with glory's charms; Each chief his sev'n-fold shield display'd, And half unsheath'd the shining blade, And seas, and rocks, and skies rebound, To arms, to arms, to arms! IV. But when thro' all th'infernal bounds, Which flaming Phlegethon surrounds, Love, strong as death, the poet led To the pale nations of the dead, What sounds were heard, What scenes appear'd, O'er all the dreary coasts! Dreadful gleams, Dismal screams, Fires that glow, Shrieks of woe, Sullen moans, Hollow groans, And cries of tortur'd ghosts! But hark! he strikes the golden lyre; And see! the tortur'd ghosts respire, See, shady forms advance! Thy stone, O Sisyphus, stands still, Ixion rests upon his wheel, And the pale spectres dance! The furies sink upon their iron beds, Aud snakes uncurl'd hang list'ning round their heads. V. By the streams that ever flow, By the fragrant winds that blow O'er th'Elysian flow'rs, By those happy souls who dwell In yellow meads of asphodel, Or amaranthine bow'rs, By the heroes armed shades, Glitt'ring thro' the gloomy glades, By the youths that dy'd for love, Wand'ring in the myrtle grove, Restore, restore Eurydice to life; Oh take the husband, or return the wife! He sung, and hell consented To hear the poet's prayer; Stern Proserpine relented And gave him back the fair. Thus song cou'd prevail O'er death and o'er hell, A conquest how hard and how glorious! Tho' fate had fast bound her, With Styx nine times round her, Yet music and love were victorious. VI. But soon, too soon, the lover turns his eyes: Again she falls, again she dies, she dies! How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move? No crime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love. Now under hanging mountains, Beside the fall of fountains, Or where Hebrus wanders Rolling in mæanders, All alone Unheard, unknown, He makes his moan, And calls her ghost, For ever, ever, ever lost! Now with furies surrounded, Despairing, confounded, He trembles, he glows Amidst Rhodope's snows; See, wild as the winds, o'er the desart he flies; Hark! Hæmus resounds with the Bacchanals cries— —Ah! see he dies! Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he sung, Eurydice still trembled on his tongue, Eurydice the woods, Eurydice the floods, Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung. VII. Music the fiercest grief can charm, And fate's severest rage disarm: Music can soften pain to ease, And make despair and madness please: Our joys below it can improve, And antedate the bliss above. This the divine Cecilia found, And to her maker's praise confin'd the sound. When the full organ joins the tuneful quire, Th'immortal pow'rs incline their ear, Borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire, While solemn airs improve the sacred fire; And angels lean from heav'n to hear. Of Orpheus now no more let poets tell, To bright Cecilia greater pow'r is giv'n; His numbers rais'd a shade from hell, Her's lift the soul to heav'n.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME III. Malé nominatis, Parcite verbis. —Hor. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE SATIRES OF HORACE. SATIRE I. [MÆcenas, whence is this caprice] He inveighs in the first place against the depraved practice of men, by which it happens that they are never contented in their own station, nor can please themselves by their own determinations, but always prize those of other men. He then takes occasion to be particularly severe upon avarice. MÆcenas, whence is this caprice, That mortals cannot live in peace? But their own lot of life disclaim, Whether by choice, or chance it came, And give the rest invidious praise!— O happy merchants! (full of days And worn with toil the soldier cries) To which the merchant-man replies, His ship by the south-wind distress't, The military life is best; The troops engage, and in a breath Glad triumph comes, or instant death. The lawyer, when his clients knock, At the first crowing of the cock, Cries up the country squire, who raves That all but citizens are slaves, When from his home he's forc'd to dance Attendance on recognizance: So many cases of this kind Are found, that they wou'd break the wind Of talking Fabius to recite; But lest I tire your patience quite— Observe—suppose some pow'r divine Shou'd say, I will to each assign The part, he chuses—I decree The soldier shall a merchant be, And he a counsellor of late Shall have the country squire's estate— Do you come here to shift the scene, And you go there—why what do you mean! They hesitate with all their hearts Tho' in their pow'r to change their parts. What cause now therefore can they show, But Jupiter shou'd puff and blow In wrath, and for the future swear He'll not consent to hear their pray'r. But to go on and not to smile, Like some who use a waggish stile. (Tho' what forbids a man, forsooth, At once to laugh and speak the truth) As fondling masters treat their boys By giving sugar-plumbs and toys, That they the better may go on, Their grammar-rudiments to con. However, raillery apart, Let us the serious matters start. He that with ploughshare cleaves the clod, The treach'rous lawyer doom'd to plod, The soldier and the tars at sea, Who boldly sail thro' each degree, Assert th'intention of their deed, Is that in age they may recede To peace, and to a plenteous board, When once they've treasur'd up their hoard. Ev'n as the ant (whose toiling might As most exemplary we cite) Drags with her mouth all she can reap, And adds to her constructed heap, Not unappriz'd, nor unprepar'd How future matters must be squar'd. However, she will not appear, When once Aquarius damps the year, And uses in her cell immur'd The goods her patient toil procur'd. Whilst then no summer-heat can tire, Nor winter, ocean, sword, nor fire, Divert you from the quest of gain; And you all obstacles disdain, So you can make your point in view, That none shall have more wealth than you. What fruit (inform me) can it bear, That with that tim'rous over-care Gold, silver, in immod'rate wealth You hide up in a hole by stealth. You answer that a lib'ral use Will sure to nothing all reduce— But without use what is the rank, Or what the beauty of the bank? Suppose your threshing-floor supply An hundred thousand bowls of rye, Your belly will demand no more Than mine, of all this mighty store; As if, 'mongst slaves, you shou'd be sped, Like Esop, with a load of bread, Not one crumb more to you wou'd fall, Than him, who carried none at all. What does it boot to him that lives Within the prescript nature gives, Whether he till an hundred rood, Or thousand acres for his food. But 'tis a pretty thing you say With a great capitol to play— If we from little funds can take Such things, as for our purpose make, Our garrets why shou'd you despise Compar'd with your great granaries! As if desirous, when a dry, Of but a jug or glass, you cry; I'd rather on the river's brink Than from this little fountain drink. Hence they, that Aufidus approach, Too large a quantity to broach, Are hurried down the rapid fall By him, that swallows banks and all. While they that want not unto waste Will free from mud their water taste; Nor, as a needless draught they crave, Will lose their lives within the wave. But most thro' false desires unwise Urge, no finances will suffice; For wealth is character and name, And, as your riches, such your fame. What can one do with such as these? Let them be wretched, if they please; According as the tale is told— A churl of Athens, full of gold, Was wont to scorn the people thus— The world may hiss and make a fuss, But I applaud myself the more, Whilst I at home my bags explore. When thirsty Tantalus wou'd quaff, The stream eludes his lips—you laugh— And yet, if we but change the name, The story of your life's the same. O'er bags, which from all hands you scrape, You cannot sleep, but stare and gape, Compell'd the plenty to refuse, As tho' 'twere sacrilege to use; Nor can they other joy supply, Than pictures to amuse the eye. What know you not the real worth Of money is, its help on earth— Buy bread, buy herbs, a flask of wine, To which you likewise may subjoin Such other articles beside, As nature grieves to be denied. But to keep watching and half-dead, Both night and day to be in dread, Of thieves, and fire, and slaves, lest they Shou'd rob the house, and run away. Such wealth with such a life endure, O rather keep me ever poor! —But if one's body shou'd be seiz'd With cold, or any way diseas'd, So that you cannot stir about, You have a friend to help you out, To bring you medicines, to call in The doctor, that your loving kin And children may again enjoy Your company—nor wife, nor boy Desire your life—both small and great, Male, female, all your neighbours hate Your very name—and is it strange That no one should good-will exchange, With one so worthless as to prize His pelf, above all social ties. But wou'd you gain and keep your friends, Whom nature without labour sends, You'd lose your toil in that respect By their refractory neglect: As who shou'd take an ass to grace The field, and enter for the race. Put then a period to pursuit, And how much more abundant fruit, You from your diligence possess, Dread want and poverty the less; And cease from all this toil of thought, That being found, for which you sought: Nor do with your ill-gotten store As one Umidius did of yore, Who was (the tale will soon be told) So rich, as ev'n to measure gold; And yet for fear that he shou'd fast, Clad, like a slave, unto his last. But him, the flow'r of A woman, who was in the spirit of Clytemnestra, the daughter of Tyndarus, who killed Agamemnon with an axe. Tyndar's breed, A woman he had lately freed, With a good cleaver split in twain— What part must then a man sustain! Wou'd you of me a Mænius make, Shall I like Nomentanus rake?— Now you are going on to fight With things, by nature opposite— Commanded not to be a sneak, You're not enjoin'd all bounds to break; There is a medium to be had, No doubt, 'twixt staring and stark mad. To all things there's a mean assign'd, And certain bounderies defin'd, From which remov'd on either hand, True rectitude can never stand. But to return—what are there none Dislike their lot, but churls alone? Nor for another's calling votes, Nor grutches of his neighbour's goats, And scruples to compare his state With thousands more unfortunate! But still is anxious to amass What one or other may surpass: When from the goal the coursers clear The whirling car—the charioteer Rushes on him that foremost speeds, But scorns what he himself precedes. And hence it is we rarely find A man so perfectly resign'd, As to declare this life he leaves, A guest, that to the full receives: Now tis enough—and lest you think I've dipt in blear-eyed Crispin's ink, And stol'n my work from his 'scrutore, I will not add a sentence more. SATIRE II. [Each minstrel, quack, and strolling play'r] By examples he confirms the adage: “while fools avoid vices, they run into the opposite extreams.” Each minstrel, quack, and strolling play'r, Each mine, and scrub is in despair, And with their ragged race deplore, Tigellius now can sing no more. The truth is, he was very good, And lib'ral to the brother-hood. Another, lest he comes to shame, Dreads such a spendthrift's very name; So close, he will not give a friend What cold and hunger may defend. Another, if you ask him why His grandsire's, father's fortunes fly, While cash he borrows but to waste, And gratify his dainty taste, He answers, he wou'd not be deem'd Mean-spirited—which is esteem'd By some as matter worthy fame, By some of obloquy and blame. Fufidius, rich in free-hold land, And money lent at the best hand, Wou'd not be call'd a thief or rake.— He from the capital will take Some five per cent. upon the nail, And the more desperate and frail A man in circumstance is found, Or life, the more he will be ground. He hunts for names, and lies in wait For youths arriv'd at man's estate, Who just from rigid guardians came— At this what man will not exclaim, O sov'reign Jove!—But he we'll say, Speeds in proportion to his pay, While it is out of human creed How much himself he will not heed; So that the father, whom we see Presented in the comedy, And tortur'd at his booby's flight Was not in such a wretched plight. Now if you wou'd inquire, my friends, To what this dissertation tends— “Why fools by ill concerted schemes, “Shun vice for opposite extremes!” SATIRE III. [This is the fault of all the quire] First he calls those to account, who while they wink at their own vices, are quick-sighted at discovering those of others—He then shews, that, after the example of lovers and parents, in friendship small failings shou'd be cover'd. To conclude, he digresses to a refutation of that stoic paradox, in which all defaults are said to be equal. This is the fault of all the quire, They will not sing at your desire, But, if you never beg a song They'll keep a quav'ring all day long. Tigellius, that Sardinian spark, Was a great proof of this remark, Had Cæsar, whose undoubted sway Might have compell'd him to obey, Pleaded, to make him shew his tone, His father's friendship and his own, He wou'd not yet with all have sped— But did he take it in his head, A bacchanalian catch he'd grace, From highest pitch to lowest bass; Or every note to every string, From egg to apple wou'd he ring. This man had not the least degree Of stedfast uniformity. Now wou'd he run as from a foe, And now with solemn pace and slow, As Juno's sacrifice he bore— Now with two hundred slaves or more He liv'd, and now with hardly ten— One while of kings and mighty men Was all his talk—another while Submissive in this humble stile— “A three leg'd stool let me procure, “A little salt that's clean and pure, “A gown too, which tho' coarse and old, “May serve to keep me from the cold; A million had you giv'n outright To this same philosophic wight, So full of thrift and of content, In five days every festerce went. Each night he sat up, till 'twas day, And snored the sunshine all the way, Never was heard of such an elf, So much at variance with himself. But here a friend his voice exalts, And asks me if I have no faults— “Why yes I have, and, if you please, “At least about as bad as these”— At absent Novius Mænius rail'd, When thus a chap his ear assail'd, To your own failings are you blind, Or wou'd you cozen all mankind! Cries Mænius, I can soon excuse Myself for all my selfish views— This is a foolish vicious love, Whose partial way we should reprove, Since you wou'd wink with both your eyes On all your own impurities, Why when your neighbours mis-demean, As eagle or as dragon keen Do you inspect.—You may depend That in his turn each injur'd friend Will like to do the same by you, As sharp and as censorious too. A certain man's too prone to rage, Not well adapted to engage With the shrewd witlings of the town, And may be laugh'd at, that his gown On his rough person losely flows, With shoes scarce cleaving to his toes. But he is good to that degree, There is no better man than he, Your friend, and under this disguise A most stupendous genius lies. Then fift yourself, and make essay, If nature, or an evil way, Have sown no undiscover'd seeds Of vice, for 'mongst the other weeds, The fern, that shou'd be burnt, will yield His crop, in each uncultur'd field. But to forearm in some respects— E'en as a mistress's defects Deceive at least, if not delight The lover—or (a case to cite) Balbinus doats upon the wen Of his dear Agna—O that men Wou'd thus in friendship be to blame, Till Virtue found an honest name For such a fault—let us be mild To friends, as parents to a child; And not for blemishes annoy— The father calls his squinting boy A leering archer full of fun, And if a man has got a son, Like Sisyphus, but two-feet tall, Why him his bantam will he call. One crooked leg'd, with fondling whine, He ranks as of the Vari-line; And if club-footed, then he smiles, And of the house of Scaurus stiles. One lives too thrifty, let him be Your fav'rite for frugality: Another's light and apt to boast, He of his humour makes the most To entertain—another's rude To take large freedom, and intrude, Let him be call'd sincere and brave— Another's hot, and giv'n to rave, But he's a man of spirit still— For such ways gain and keep good-will— But we the virtues ev'n invert, On purest vessels throwing dirt. A man of probity we find As guilty of an abject mind; If one amongst us too is slow, On him the blockhead we bestow. Another's cautious of a snare, Nor ever lays his bosom bare To bad men (as he lives in times With envy fraught and thriving crimes) Him stead of prudent and discrete We term a man of dark deceit. If one is unreserv'd and free To such familiarity, As I with you, Mæcenas, use, And interrupt you, when you muse, Or read—with any kind of prate Intrusive or importunate— At such a guest they take offence And swear the man wants common sense. How injudiciously, alas! A law against ourselves we pass; For no one without faults is bred, Who has the fewest, is the head. When my dear friend (as justice pleads) Weighs 'gainst my bad my better deeds, Let him, if he wou'd win my heart, Incline unto the major part, If such indeed my virtues prove, Then in requital of his love, The self-same scale shall be applied, Whene'er he's summon'd to be tried. He that requires his humpt-back shape Shou'd his friends ridicule escape, May certainly himself exhort To wink upon his neighbour's wart. 'Tis equal, who for pardon sues Shou'd not in turn, that grace refuse. In fine, since wrath amongst the rest Of crimes, that foolish men infest, Cannot be totally suppress'd; Why does not human reason rate Things by its measure and its weight, And only punish faults, as far As guilt or provocation are. If any one his slave shou'd slay, Who when he's bid to take away, Sequesters one half-eaten fish, Or licks warm broth from out the dish, His madness wou'd give more offence, Than Labeo, with all men of sense. But greater still 'gainst reason's laws Are follies play'd without a cause. Your friend has done some slight affair, Which if you don't forgive and spare, You shou'd be call'd severe and sour, And yet you from his presence scow'r, With equal hatred and dismay As Druso's debtor on the day, Who when the cruel Calends come, If neither int'rest nor the sum He can procure, by hook or crook, Must hear him read his doom's-day-book, His servile throat in posture put, As if preferring to be cut. Suppose my friend has by his ale Been forc'd upon my couch to stale, Or at my board a dish has broke Which for Of such valuable antiquity that it might be supposed to have belonged to Evander, who entertained Æneas upon his landing in Italy. Evander was bespoke. For this—or when the servants bring A chicken, shou'd devour a wing, Which to my seat was rather near, Shall he for this be held less dear? What can I do, if he should steal, Or things of secrecy reveal, Or break his word?—They who decry All crimes as of an equal die, Are gravel'd, when you come to facts— For other laws good sense enacts, Sound morals, and convenience too, Source of all justice, that we do. When first upon the new-form'd earth Poor mortals crawl'd out from their birth, A race but just remov'd from brutes, For caves and caverns their disputes They did with nails and fists decide, But by degrees their clubs they plied, And at the last with arms they fought, Which long experience forg'd and taught, Till The understanding of Horace was so benighted, that he supposed language to be gradual, and of human invention—nevertheless The Lord is the Word, and all good words proceed from him, as sure nonsense and cant are derivable from the Adversary. words at length, and names they found, To ascertain their thoughts by sound. Hence they began from war to pause, To wall in towns, and 'stablish laws, That theft should not unpunish'd be, Nor rapine, nor adultery, For long before fair Helen's charms Had woman set the world in arms, But all those savages are fled, And all without memorial dead, Who, like the tenants of the wild, With vagrant lust themselves defil'd, As still the strong the weaker slew, And did as bulls for heifers do. Now laws were a preventive aid For fear of man's injustice made, This all must evidence, who mind Each age, and hist'ry of mankind: Nor can mere nature sep'rate right From wrong, by as distinct a light, As she can sever good from ill, Or what shou'd check, or tempt the will: Nor e'er can reason make it plain, That he's as much a rogue in grain, Who breaks for sprouts his neigbour's hedge, As he that does a sacrilege. Some certain rule then let us state To make chastisement adequate, Lest him you scourge severe and rash, Who scarce deserves a single lash, For I do not the least surmise, That you will with the rod chastise Him that deserves more dreadful doom, Since your assertions so presume, That theft is of as great a die In guilt, as high-way robbery, And threaten you wou'd cut off all Defaults alike, both great and small, If man wou'd give you sov'reign sway— So much for what the Stoicks say. If he is rich who's wise withall, Tho' but a cobler in his stall, The beauty of the world alone, And king upon an endless throne, Why pray for what is in your hand? You do not, surely, understand, What he, the sire of all our sect, Crysippus says in this respect, “The wise-man makes himself no sole, “Yet is a cobler on the whole.” How's this—Hermogenes, tho' dumb, His voice can raise and harp can thrum, Alfenus thus, in lawyer's gown, His awl, and implements laid down. Himself a cobler still affirms— The stoick on no other terms Is jack-of-all-trades and a king— The boys, that round you form a ring, Will pluck your beard, and by the press You shall be brought to last distress, And snarl and burst your lungs in vain Unless your staff the mob restrain Supreme of monarchs—but to wave Prolixity—while you shall lave Your body in the farthing bath, Crysippus following your path, And my dear friends shall set aside The things, in which my feet shall slide, Why in return I shall enlarge My heart, to give them their discharge. In private life for more the thing, Than your imaginary king. SATIRE IV. [Cratinus, Eupolis, with these] He asserts that Lucillius was particularly tart, by following the ancient comedy amongst the Grecians— However he shews his own writings are not to be read in the same view, since (as they were satirical in the general) the most part of mankind conscious of some vice or other, understand themselves to be hinted at therein. Otherwise he professes himself clear of virulence, and to deter men from vice with pleasantry, and by a fatherly kind of chastisement. Cratinus, Eupolis, with these And others Aristophanes, Who made their comedies of yore If any man on any score, Was worthy of a shameful note They branded him, in what they wrote, With perfect freedom and by name, As thief, adult'rous son of shame, Cut-throat, or any otherwise Disgrac'd—with them Lucillius vies, On them depends upon the whole By changing feet, and measure droll; Keen—but still making verses halt, For this was his peculiar fault, Two hundred verses in an hour (As a great work to shew his pow'r) Oft wou'd he dictate to his guest, Still standing hip-hop for a jest. Mean-time, while muddy was his lay, There was, what one wou'd wish away— Verbose—too indolent to bear The toil of writing and the care, That is the care of writing clean, For much is not the thing I mean. But here Crispinus' wrath I whet To challenge me at any bet. “Your tablets take, this instant take, “A trial if you choose to make, “Appoint your umpires, hour and place, “To see who writes the greatest pace”— The gods have done the best of all To make my spirit poor and small, Who seldom speak and then but spare, While you may imitate the air, That's in the leathern bellows pent, There puffs and blows and is not spent, Until the iron's soft and red— The happy Fannius sure is sped, Who in the library has thrust Unbid, both manuscripts and bust. While not a soul will read my verse Who am too tim'rous to rehearse, My works in publick—now the cause Why few will give, this kind applause Is that the major part are wrong— Take whom you will from out the throng; Or avarice perverts his ways, Or desperate ambition sways. One's mad upon his neighbour's wives, In other filth some waste their lives. This on his silver side-board glotes, Albius on brazen statues doats: One with his merchandize will run, From eastern to the western sun, Thro' every ill with sails unfurl'd, Like dust that in the wind is whirl'd, Rush headlong, lest a want should come To take a farthing from his sum, Or to enlarge his stock—all these The muse alarms, the bards displease. “There's hay upon his horn—fly, fly, “Can he but raise a laugh, they cry, “He'll not his father's failings brook, “And, what's once enter'd in his book, “To young and old he'll publick make “Who come from bake house or the lake.” But come my refutation hear, As I in my behalf appear. First then I will myself reject From men of the poetic sect; 'Tis not sufficient for the name, That merely metre we can frame. Now if a fellow writes like me As near to prose, as verse can be, You must not think he has the vein— But one of a diviner strain, Who has a genius and a tongue, By which eternal things are sung; On him this glorious praise confer— Hence things of comic character If fairly they can be giv'n out As poems some have made a doubt: Because both words, and things of course, Have neither spirit, fire, or force; Men talk, or, if from talk disjoin'd, By measure of prosaic kind. But yet you'll say the sire's in rage Because his son the whores engage, Who for their sakes neglects a wife, And all the wealth and sweets of life, A drunkard and (O shame to say) With flambeaus in the blaze of day. What? wou'd the loose Pomponius hear One word less grand, and less severe, Granting his father were alive Hence 'twill not answer to contrive, The verses in a style compleat, All which, if you displace the feet, A peasant in his wrath might say, As well as Demea in the play, If from those lines I now indite, Or those Lucillius us'd to write, The measure and the pause you take, And the last words the former make, You cou'd not find, but wholly lose The members of the mangled muse Not so if Ennius thus you use. What time dire discord burst the bars, And forc'd their iron ports of Mars. So far of this—another place Shall be reserv'd by me to trace If comedy's by scene and plot A poem fairly term'd or not. But now I only shall debate, Whether this kind you justly hate. Sharp Salcius and Caprius hoarse, As their indictment they enforce Both to the gang great terror give, But if a man discretely live, He may contemn them both—Tho' you Like Cœlus, and like Birrus too, Upon the road have made full free, I am not Caprius—fear not me. To shop, nor stall my volumes come, There for the sweaty mob to thumb, Nor for Hermogenes to hum. I never but to friends repeat, Nor that, but when they much intreat; Not any where to any croud— Many there are, that read aloud Ev'n in the market, or the springs Where people bathe—when he that sings May by the closeness of the place Give to his voice a finer grace. To coxcombs this a grateful task, Who never have the sense to ask About the purpose, or the time— But here they brand me with the crime Of hurting with a bad intent— From whence can this 'gainst me be meant? Is any then your voncher, say, With whom I've liv'd unto this day? He, who backbites his absent friend, Nay more, who does not still defend His fame, and stands on his behalf; He, who wou'd raise a spiteful laugh, Who no loquacity forbears, And what he never saw declares, And he, whose tongue is not controul'd By what in confidence is told, That fellow is a black in grain, From him, O Roman youth, refrain. You'll often see twelve guests repose Upon three couches—one of those Ere he has sup'd must needs asperse All beings of the universe, Except the man, that rules the roast, And him, ev'n him he'll lash the most, When Bacchus, who the truth reveals, From his free heart all secrets steals. This man to you, who hate a black, Seems witty with a pretty knack. If I one time upon a prank Have said too frolicksome and frank That while Rufillus clogs the sense, Gorgonius has the goat's offence; Is churlish envy, then my vice? If any mention shou'd arise Of things Petillus stole away, Made in your presence—you wou'd say The man thro' habit, to defend Petillus, always was my friend, And from a child we were as one, Much for my asking has he done, And I rejoice he lives in peace, Because it was a strange release He from the gallows lately had— This is rank poyson very bad, Sheer envy, which shall have no part Or in my writings, or my heart, If I can promise once for all Or understand myself at all. If ought too freely I have spoke, Or been, perhaps, too much in joke, Your kind indulgence you'll allow, For that I shall inform you now. The best of fathers taught me this, That I shou'd keep from things amiss, By certain shrewd remarks, he made— Me, when he wanted to persuade To thrift, and frugally to live, Content with what he had to give; “Do you not see (he wou'd observe) “How Albius' son is like to starve, “And Barrus too reduc'd and low— “These are great documents to show “The mis'ry of a substance spent.” Whenever it was his intent To fright me from loose girls (he cry'd) “Let not Sectanus be your guide,” Lest I should seek the wedded dame, When I might have a lawful flame: “Trebonius, hamper'd in the fact, “Has not his character compact: “Philosophy (says he) my son, “May teach you what to seek and shun, “And render reasons more than I, “Let it suffice me to apply “Old rules, traditionally gain'd, “And keep your life and fame unstain'd, “As long as you a tutor need; “The riper age will soon succeed “To strengthen every thought and limb, “And then without your corks you'll swim.” 'Twas thus he form'd my tender mind, And if he any thing enjoin'd, “For this affair you have (says he) “A laudable authority;” Then wou'd he cite, the point to clench, One of the sages of the bench. But did he any thing restrain?— “Can you (says he) a doubt maintain, “But such a thing, in such a case, “Is vain, and nothing but disgrace, “Since He, or they are come to shame “For doing of the very same!— “As ev'ry neighbour's funeral frights “Sick men with greedy appetites, “And makes them spare themselves, for fear “Their own interment should be near: “So tender minds are often warn'd “While others for their vice are scorn'd.” Thus instituted I am free From vices of the first degree, That post a mortal to his grave, But small and venial faults I have; And these, perhaps, maturer years, Sincere advice of my compeers, And due reflexions on the past May totally reduce at last: And in my bed, and when I stir, I am not wanting to confer Thus with myself, “this thing is well— “By doing this I shall excell— “By aiming at some certain end “I shall be better with my friend— “Such a transaction was oblique, “Shall I then ever do the like?”— All this unto myself I say— When idle with my pen I play: This is amongst those faults I class't But as of an inferiour cast; Which if you will not freely own As pardonable, be it known, That all the vast poetic band, Now, more than ever, is at hand, And like the Pharisee and Scribe We'll force you to embrace our tribe. SATIRE V. [Arriv'd from all the pomp and din] He describes his journey from Rome to Brundusium, after the pattern of Lucillius, who had given an account of a party of his to the same place. He likewise gives a narrative what laughable matters had occurred in that expedition, amongst which the squabble between the two buffoons, Sarmentus and Messius, obtain the first place. Arriv'd from all the pomp and din Of Rome, Aricia took me in, A guest but sorrily bestow'd; But my companion on the road Was Heliodorus, that fam'd Greek Who teaches youth the art to speak. To This is the place where the Jews, residing at Rome, met St. Paul. Acts xxviii. v. 15. Apii-Forum thence we hied, Where landlords sour and tars reside. This journey which is but a day For those that expedite their way, Finding so many things to do With idleness we split in two. For them, that often choose to call, The Appian way is best of all, And here the water was so vile I mortified my gut, the while The company sat down to meat And not without vexation eat. Now night was bringing on the shade, And all the signs of heav'n display'd; Then with the tars our slaves begun, A spice of their vociferous fun, Which soon was answered by the crew— “Why here, you sorry knaves bring to— “You're cramming in the folks too fast, “Three hundred are enough—avast!” Now while their money they demand, And mule is fasten'd to a stand, An hour elaps'd—the plaguy gnats, And frogs, that crowd the fenny flats, Drive off repose—the muleteer And waterman combin'd to clear Their pipes, and on the charms enlarg'd Of their dear girls, with drink o'ercharg'd, Till the tir'd muleteer began To sleep—the lazy waterman Tyed the mule's tackle to a stone, And sent her out to graze alone! Then snored upon his back—the day Now sprung, and we had made no way. Then one more hot-brain'd than the rest Leapt out, and being first possest From willows of a sturdy tool, Bang'd head and back of man and mule; Till the fourth hour was more than past, When we were set ashore at last. Feronia, in thy marble vase Each of us wash'd his hands and face, And having din'd, three miles we creep Beneath white Anxur's rocky steep. Here both Mæcenas, and the great Cocceius, were to come in state, As they ambassadors were sent, On an affair of high event, Us'd separate friends to reunite.— Here, I disorder'd in my sight, With my black salve my eyes besmear'd— Mæcenas during this appear'd, Cocceius too, and Capito, The most accomplish'd man I know, And Antony's especial friend— From hence our course we trav'lers bend, And Fundi pass with much good will, Where A little proud magistrate of a petty place, taking upon him the state of the Prætor, who was Lord Mayor of Rome. Luscus was the Prætor still, Not without laughing at the tribe Attending on this crazy scribe, His robe, and laticlave withal, And pan of incense in his hall; From thence to Formiæ we roam, Murena finding us an home, And gen'rous Capito his cook; Next day the brightest in the book Arose, for Plotius, Varius came, And Virgil of eternal name: At Sinuessa these we met, Of spirits so select a set, Than which earth ne'er did bear or see, More candid, or more dear to me. Oh! what embraces all around, What joy was at this meeting found; There's nothing I would recommend, In pref'rence to a pleasant friend. With lodging next, the place that's nigh Campania's bridge did us supply. Purveyors brought us wood and salt, They were obliged to do this for all persons sent upon public business. Horace therefore availed himself of Mæcenas his embassy.For fear of suff'ring, on default: From hence the mules their packs dispose At Capua, e'er the damps arose. Mæcenas goes to fives (as I And Virgil on our couches lie) For balls are bad things for the blind, And those that are to coughs inclin'd. Thence for Cocceius' seat we bear, Where all good things abound, and where The Caudian Inns are likewise built.— Now, muse, deliver if thou wilt, In a few words the war, enrag'd Sarmentus and Cicerrus wag'd, And from what ancestors in pride These heroes with each other vied: Cicerrus of grand Oscian The Osci was esteemed the meanest people in all Italy. race, Sarmentus is not out of place, On such illustrious pretence, The gallant combat they commence: Sarmentus first, “you seem disturb'd, “Like a mad horse, that should be curb'd.” We laugh'd, and Messius, “'Tis well said,” Replied, and shook his furious head. “O (says Sarmentus) what, if now “Your horn was extant on your brow, “Wou'd you atchieve—since ev'n thus maim'd “You have at such distortions aim'd?” Now a most lamentable scar Did Messius' grisled forehead mar; Then pelting him with jests apace, Upon his rubicund grimace, Where many a carbuncle and wart Grew of the right Campanian sort; “Pray for a dance, Sir, let me ask, “The Cyclops jig—you need no mask, “Nor can for buskins be concern'd.”— To this Cicerrus much return'd. Ask'd if his houshold Gods had got, The chain he vow'd shou'd be there lot, That, tho' by trade a scribbling knave, He was not less his lady's slave; He kindly beg'd to know for why He took it in his head to fly, Since that for one so lank and spare, A pound of bread was plenteous fare. In short this humorous event, Prolong'd our meal in merriment. To Beneventum thence next day, Straight as a line, we made our way, Where, while the meagre thrushes roast, The flames nigh burnt our bustling host, For thro' th'old kitchen widely spread, Th'ascending flakes were making head: Then trembling slaves you might have view'd, Eager to have the fire subdued, And guests, each greedy of his claim, Snatching their supper from the flame. From hence Apulia 'gan to show The mountains I was born to know, Which by A wind particularly noxious to Apulia. Atabulus are swept, And whence we never shou'd have crept, Unless Trivicum's little sheds Had found us where to lay our heads, But not without such clouds of smoke, As did the very tears provoke, The hearth within a certain house, Burning both leaves and wet green boughs. Miles twenty-four from hence we ran Bowl'd in post-chariots, for our plan Was at a place to make our stay, Whose name in Equotutium, which will not stand in an hexameter. verse we cannot say; But 'tis describable when told, By signs, for here the water's sold, Water the cheapest thing elsewhere, And here the worst—their bread is fair, And good, so that upon the road The trav'lers choose to take a load, For full of grit Canusium sells Her loaves, nor has she better wells: Tho' Diomede of brave renown, Chose this same place to build a town. Here pensive Varius takes his leave Of friends, that likewise weep and grieve. To Rubi next we were convey'd, All tir'd to death, as we had made A longer journey thro' bad ways, More tedious for the rainy days. The morning was a little fair, But then the ways more dirty were, As far as Barium's fishy coast— To Gnatia from this place we post, Which is a city that arose With all the water-nymphs its foes: But here they much diversion made, When us they wanted to persuade, That incense in their sacred shrine The miracle of the liquefaction of St. Januerius's blood is such another.Melts without heating—I decline All credit to the tale, the Jews May think it genuine, if they choose. For I then learnt the pow'rs above Dwell in security and love; Nor if a miracle be told Of Nature, will it therefore hold The Gods have sent it from the sky By their profound anxiety— Brundusium, which at length we gain, Ends the long journey, and the strain. SATIRE VI. To Mæcenas. He finds fault with the futile opinion of the Romans, in regard to Nobility, which they estimated by antiquity of family, rather than merit, and did not willingly admit any one to the great offices of state without that qualification. That no one could envy him the friendship of Mæcenas, upon the same principle they envied the post of Tribune, since that was not a matter of chance, but obtained by the recommendation of virtue. And finally, he demonstrates that his lot in private life, is far happier than it could be in the magistracy. Tho' of the Lydians, that came o'er To settle on th'Etrurian shore, Not one is of more rank than you, And tho' your sire and grandsire too, Reckon'd on either parent's side, Did o'er such mighty hosts preside; Yet, friend, the manners of the great In this you do not imitate, At low-born men to toss the nose, Like me who from a free'd-man rose. Because you will not grant that birth, Tho' mean, can cancel real worth. This is a truth that you maintain, That long before the servile reign, And pow'r of Tullius, many a one, That merely from themselves begun, Have both been held of good repute, And the first honours gain'd to boot: Whereas Lævinus, tho' the seed Of great Poplicola, who freed The Romans from proud Tarquin's sway, Was not a jot the more in play. Ev'n with that judge, so well you know, The mob, who oftentimes bestow Their honours on a worthless name, And are the dupes of vulgar fame, Amaz'd at titles, and a bust— But how shall we ourselves adjust, Rais'd from all vulgar thoughts so high? For granting that the pop'lar cry, Had rais'd Lævinus to the chair, Rather than plac'd new Decius there, Or granted that the Appian frown, Had from the senate turn'd me down As not of parents nobly born. (And well I had deserv'd his scorn, While not content in my own dress) Yet, after all, we must confess, Glory's gilt chariot drags along The gen'rous, as the vulgar throng. What profit, Tullius, wou'd you have Shou'd you resume your laticlave; And be a tribune, in that state The public envy, public hate Was greater than they could have been In your reserv'd domestic scene. For soon as an ambitious sot, Has on his legs black buskins got, With purple robe upon his back, Such sounds as these his ears attack— “Who's that, and who's his father, speak?” As if a fellow shou'd be weak, Like Barrus, whose desire and plan, Is to be held a pretty man: That he may tempt the ladies fair, Still to enquire with anxious care, What face, leg, foot, what teeth, and hair? So he, that promises and swears That Rome, and all the world's affairs, That Italy, the public fanes, Shall be protected by his pains, Drives all mankind to be concern'd, “Who's this, the man that is return'd! “What is his father? was the dame “That bore him of a virtuous fame? “Shall Syrus, you, or Dama's heir, “Or Dionysius' offspring dare, “From the Tarpeian, men of Rome “Throw down, or unto Cadmus The public executioner. doom “My colleague—Nevius tho' must sit “One step behind me, as if fit, “For he was of my father's class—” But do you therefore think to pass, As Paulus or Messala may— But here your colleague will huzza; As if three funerals in the street, Should with two hundred waggons meet, And horns and trumpets too outvie, His gift our choice to justify. Now I return to my own case, By all still reckon'd in disgrace; Born of a free'd-man is their scorn, And I am of a free'd-man born— And this, Mæcenas, now they do, Because I am a guest with you; This too some years ago they said, When me the Roman band obey'd. The first is diff'rent from the last, Because the honour that is past, No man can envy in degree, As that I am so well with thee, So cautious to select such friends, As unambitious worth commends. I cannot think it merely chance, That did me to this rank advance; For it was not a lucky throw, But Virgil, Varius, long ago; Those flow'rs of friendship were the cause, By fairly saying what I was. When first into your presence led, Some interrupted words I said; For stiffled by an aukward shame, Few words in broken accents came. I did not at that time aspire, To be the son of some great sire, Nor drawn by Satureian steeds, To traverse thro' my native meads; But, what indeed I was, report— You, as your custom is, was short In what you answered—I retir'd; And e'er the year was quite expir'd, You call'd me to your gates again, And bade me rank amongst your train. 'Tis a great honour I confess, That I could have so much address, With such a person to find grace, Who picks the best, and spurns the base, Preferring moral men, and sage, To those of glorious parentage. But if my nature has a spice, Of here and there a little vice, And otherwise is quite direct; (Or if a critic should detect, In some fair body certain flaws) Yet if the crimes against the laws, Or avarice or dirty ways, No man can urge to my dispraise; If with clean hands and conscience clear, (That I may for myself appear) I live, and to my friends am dear: All this was from my father's hand, Who poor, and with a little land, Yet cou'd not bear to have me brought To the low school, that Flavius taught; Where hulking lads in clumsy gaite, Bearing their satchel and their slate, Sprung from tall soldiers, to a day Went duly with their quarter's pay; But dar'd to trust his boy of parts At Rome, to learn those lib'ral arts, Which every senator, or knight, Prescribes his children—at the sight Of all my slaves, and decent gown, In such a great and populous town, They might have thought that all this show, Did from some patrimony flow. Himself the wariest guard and spy, Still to my masters had an eye: In short, he kept me chaste and free, (Which is fair virtue's first degree) Both from all guilt, and obloquy. Nor did he for his own part care About the blame, that he might bear, Shou'd I be forc'd to get my bread As auctioneer, or even be sped Like him upon the tax to go, Nor had I murmur'd, were it so. For this upon the whole you see, More praise from all to him shou'd be, And far more gratitude from me. As long as I've my wits intire, I can't repent of such a sire. Wherefore I shall not act like some, Who did not from good parents come, And plead the fault was not their own— Far wide of all such useless moan Are both my language and my heart; For could we from our years depart, And reach the past of life, and choose Our parents by ambitious views, Content with mine, I'd not desire Those, that to higher posts aspire. For this, by all the revel rout, I shou'd be deem'd as mad, no doubt; But you, perhaps, wou'd hold me sane, That from a burthen I refrain, Which I'm unable to sustain. For in that case, without debate Things must be had in greater state, More ceremonies than before, With two or three companions more, For fear I shou'd at home remain, Or go abroad without a train. Men slaves, with coaches and a stand Of horses too, I must command. Now can I go serene and cool, More pleasant on my bob-tail mule, E'en to Tarentum, if it suit, With cloak-bag, and myself to boot. Yet none alive in this respect, Will stingyness to me object; In such as Tullius, is thy due, When five slaves only follow you, A mighty prætor, as you are, With wine, and necessary jar. Sage senator, on this account, Thee, and ten thousand I surmount. Where'er I will is in my pow'r To walk, and cheapen greens and flow'r. The Circus, where they trick and thieve, And Forum I frequent at eve. The temples duly I attend, Then homewards make my journey's end; And take my supper at my ease, Of onions, pancakes, or of pease. Three slaves the supper serve—at hand Two large mugs, and a tumbler stand Upon a marble slab, with ew'r And bowl, and cruet mean and poor. I go to sleep, without dismay, That I must rise betimes next day, And in my rambles stand the shock Of Marsya's phiz, who tho' a block, Still signifies with hideous stare, That he cannot young Novius bear. To the fourth hour I lay me down, Then take a walk about the town; Or my still privacy delight By reading, or by what I write. Then I take oil—but better chuse, Then Natta robs the lamps to use. But when the sun with fiercer beam Warns me to seek the cooling stream, I foil the dog-star's heat, and swim. Next after dining in such wise, As with an appetite to rise; I lounge at home—such are the days Of men, whom no ambition sways. With these few comforts I console Myself, more happy on the whole, Than if my sire and grandsire both, Had fairly took the Questor's oath. SATIRE VII. [How Persius, ev'n that mongrel thing] He describes a squabble between Rupilius, sirnamed This is one of the meanest productions in all Horace, and seems to have been written for the sake of a sorry pun upon the word Rex. King, with one Persius, a Grecian of mean account. How Persius, ev'n that mongrel thing, Aveng'd himself against one King, Who by Octavius was proscrib'd, He had such spite and gall imbib'd, I make no doubt but long ago, All Barbers and their patients know. This Persius was compell'd to be On business at Clazomenae, Because his bulk of wealth was there, With King too a perplex'd affair. This man was harsh, and of such hate, That even King's was not so great, Full of all confidence and vain, And still in such abusive strain, That he cou'd distance and out do, The Barri and Sisennæ too. But now return we to this King, When they cou'd to no issue bring Their contest, (for when war breaks out, Its longer, as the men are stout; Thus to such lengths did Priam's son And spirited Achilles run, That their intolerable rage, Cou'd nought but death itself assuage. And this too was the very cause, Since each deserv'd so great applause; And if there shou'd begin a fight 'Twixt heroes of unequal might, The worst by presents must recede, As Glaucus did by Diomede) When Brutus was the prætor chose Of Asia, these intrepid foes Like A pair of gladiators. Bacchius with Bithus match'd, Hasted to have th'affair dispatch'd, With vehemence they both proceed, And were a curious sight indeed: Persius the first the case expounds, Till laughter from all sides rebounds; He praises Brutus and his band, “The sun of Asia for command,” And all that follow'd him to fight, He calls his satellites of light, Except this King, who all things mars, Curs'd as the Dog amongst the stars. Made of precipitance and mud, He rush'd on like a wintry flood; The King then on his running on, Wou'd have attack'd him pro and con, According to the cant express Of clowns, who're sent the vines to dress, For all the passengers gave out, When he cried cuckold, thief, or lout— But this same Grecian dipt in gall, From Italy began to bawl— “By all th'immortal Gods, O Brute, “To thee I make my fervent suit, “Thou that are wont all kings to kill, “Use this King also as you will, “For take my word, it is the task “Of him that bears both ax and mask.” SATIRE VIII. [Cut from the bastard-fig of yore] He introduces the god Priapus, keeper of the gardens, complaining of the witches Canidia and Sagana, and describing what was done by them in secret. Cut from the bastard-fig of yore, A lumpish useless form I bore, When the pos'd joiner was in doubt, What in the end I shou'd turn out, A God, or chopping block—at last My lot was for Priapus cast. Hence as a pow'r divine, I stand To scare the thieves and birds—my hand The former checks, but for the crows A reed is fix'd above my nose, Which still forbids them to parade In these fine gardens, newly made. Here sometime since the fellow-slave, Brought out dead corpses to the grave, From all their narrow cells thrown out, And in vile coffins borne about. This was the common burying place, For wretches of Plebeian race, Where fool Pantolabus they bore, And Nomentanus rakes no more. A pillar here inscrib'd, assign'd A thousand feet in front—behind Three hundred tow'rds the fields adjoin'd; A fixt memorial, to assert It could not to the heir revert. But now so good th'Esquilian air, That one may like a lodging there, And on a sunny terras stalk, Where grieved spectators us'd to walk, And view with lamentable groans, The place deform'd with human bones. Tho' both the thieves and ev'ry brute, That us'd to haunt this place to boot, Gave me not half the plague and care, As these old hags that here repair, And with their magic drugs and charms Turn people's brains—by no alarms These can I quell or drive away, When the vague beauteous moon-beams play. But that both bones they will collect, And simples of a curs'd effect, I saw Canidia in black gown Succinct, and walking up and down With naked feet, dishevell'd hair, And howling to the midnight air; With Sagana that elder scold— They both were ghastly to behold. Then they began with nails to scratch The earth, and with their teeth dispatch A black ewe-lamb alive and crude, His blood into a ditch they spew'd, That so they might the ghosts compel, To give them answers out of hell. A woollen effigy they bring, And one of wax—the former thing Was largest, and in act express, As if 'twas punishing the less. The waxen was in suppliant mood, As bound to perish on the rood. This hag did Hecate invoke, That fell Tisiphone bespoke; While serpents and infernal curs, And moon behind the sepulchres You might have seen to blush for shame, Lest she, forsooth, should bear the blame. Now if one lie defile my tongue, May all the crows my form bedung! Why should I mention every fact, And tell each circumstance exact? How Sagana to a spectre speaks, The one by grumbling, one by shrieks, And how in earth, with wolf's grim beard, They teeth of spotted snake interr'd. How from the image made of wax, A rousing fire awakes and cracks. How at these furies I was shock'd, But not intirely foil'd and mock'd; For as a bladder sounds, when broke, I from my fig-posteriors spoke. They scar'd, into the city hied, With laughter then you might have died. Canidia's artificial bones For teeth, came tumbling on the stones: And what the jest shou'd not abate, Old Sagana soon lost her tete, With magic herbs upon the ground, And bracelet from her arm unbound. SATIRE IX. [A saunt'ring on the sacred way] He describes the impertinence and persevering garrulity of a certain person whom he happened on by chance. A saunt'ring on the sacred way, (As is my custom every day) Upon some trivial thing intent, With all my thoughts engag'd, I went. When, lo! a chap, whom by his name I barely knew, abruptly came, And grasping hard my hand in his, “How does the dearest man, that is?” The times consider'd, I can do, With my best wishes, Sir, for you. But finding that he still kept on, I ask'd him, what he was upon? He answer'd, “Sir, you must know me, “A scholar of the first degree.”— I told him on that very score, He must of me be priz'd the more. Now in the last distress my pace I mend, and sometime for a space Stand still—and whisper to my lad, Sweating from head to foot, like-mad: O blest Bollanus! in my heart I said, ev'n blockhead as thou art! Still he went on my ears to greet, “A noble town! a glorious street!” Whatever came into his head; But when he found I nothing said, Says he, “I know you are in pain “To get away, 'tis very plain. “But you are ne'er the near, good friend! “I'll still keep up, and still attend— “And pray, Sir, which way is your route?” —You need not go so much about. It is upon a man to wait, You do not know at any rate, Across the Tiber, and as far Almost, as Cæsar's gardens are. “Brisk, and quite disengaged, I'll cleave “Unto your honour, by your leave.” Here brought to such a sorry pass, I hang my ears, like some poor ass, Whose grudging spirit cannot bear A heavier burthen, than is fair. Again his tongue began to run, “Me, if you knew, you wou'd not shun, “Nor wou'd ev'n There is a very pleasant equivocation in the proper name Viscus, which likewise signifies bird-lime. Viscus close ally, “Or Varius be more dear than I. “For who's a better bard than me, “Or writes so fast, or flows so free?” “Who dances with an easier grace? “Then for your treble and your base, “I raise with voice so tun'd to please, “The envy of Hermogenes.”— Here was a respite, to thrust in A word or two—Have you no kin, Are you no mother's darling hope, Who would not wish you to elope!— “—No not a soul—I've buried all.”— Thrice blessed in their funeral. Alas! now I alone survive, Dispatch and havock me alive. For now the hour is come, foretold By Sabine sorceress of old, When for my fate her urn she shook— This child (I read it in his look) Nor poison, nor the hostile spear, Nor pleurisy, nor cough need fear— Nor shall the gout affect his brain; Born by a babbler to be slain; Such he'll avoid, if he is sage, Shou'd he but live, and come of age.— To Vesta's now (one fourth of day Quite gone and spent) we made our way. And he, by a most lucky chance, Was call'd upon recognizance, Which if he shou'd neglect to do, An instant non-suit must ensue. “Step in (says he) my dearest bard, “If you retain the least regard.”— 'Sdeath! Sir, I scarce can stand or go, And hurry to the place, you know— Nor am I vers'd in civil law. Says he, “Now whether to withdraw “From you, or to desert my cause, “Is that on which I needs must pause.”— Me, Sir, I beg you would forbear— “I cannot do it, Sir, I swear.”— Then he began to take the lead; I (for no parley can succeed Against the victor) creep behind. “Mæcenas, how is he inclin'd?” Cries he, continuing his prate— Few men with him are intimate; A man of excellent good sense, No one man has greater eminence, By fairly pushing of success.”— —“Here is your man, whose clean address “Cou'd much assist you, hand and heart, “And finely play an underpart; “Of all the rest you'd soon dispose.”— —We are not on such terms as those; Nor is there any house in Rome More free from that, which you presume. My circumstance is not concern'd, Tho' one's more rich, and one's more learn'd, All have their special ranks and cares.— —“You tell me marvellous affairs, “Scarce credible!”—'Tis even so.— —“Now you inflame me more to know, “And to be near him;”—To desire A thing from him is to acquire; Such is your merit, 'twill be done, And he is easy to be won; Wherefore he's apt to keep on guard, And make his first approaches hard.— —“I'll not be wanting to my plan, “But bribe his servants, man by man. “And if I am repuls'd to-day— “I'll not desist—I'll mark his way, “I will for all occasions wait, “I'll see his honour home in state. “The lot of human life is such, “Nought's done but by endeavouring much.”— Thus while he rattled without end, Aristius Fuscus, my dear friend, One who full well this fellow knew, Came up and met us—how do you do, And whether bound, each ask'd and told— I twitch his sleeve, and strive to hold His arms reluctant—from this scrape, Nodding and winking to escape. He laugh'd, and scrupled by the dint Of ill-tim'd jest to take the hint— I, with my vitals all inflam'd, Cry “sure you lately something nam'd, “That you in secret had for me.”— O! I remember it (says he) But I a fitter time shall choose, 'Tis a great sabbath with the Jews, When surely you wou'd not offend— “I'm not so scrupulous, dear friend.” But pardon him of weaker turn, One of the many—we'll adjourn— Another day—and I'll advise— (O that so black a sun shou'd rise!) Away the traitor runs for life, And leaves my throat beneath the knife— By happiest chance the plaintiff came, And “where away, thou son of shame;” He roar'd aloud—then me addrest— “Sir, will you witness this arrest.”— I yield—he's hurried to the hall— Both parties make a grievous bawl— The concourse on all sides is great— Thus Phœbus stav'd his poet's fate. SATIRE X. [Well, I did say Lucilius penn'd] This Satire is an answer to those who had taken offence at the Fourth, in which he finds fault with the verses of Lucillius;—and he renders a reason for such reprehension, and shews it to be just. Well, I did say Lucilius penn'd Lame verses—who's so much his friend, And fawning dupe, to praise amiss, As not at least to grant me this? But that he smartly lash'd the age, I praise him in the self-same page. Yet, tho' I this one truth attest, I cannot grant you all the rest. For so I might admire each mime, Laberius wrote, as true sublime. Wherefore 'tis not enough to win The hearer's ear, and make him grin, (Tho' this is merit in degree) But that the period may run free, Nor with vain words the ear be tir'd— There is a brevity requir'd. The stile too sometimes shou'd of right Be grave, and often arch and light, As acting now the poet's part, And now the pleader to the heart; And sometime lower'd, to acquit The part of a familiar wit, Who will his strength and skill neglect, The more to heighten the effect. By satire in a pleasant vein, A weighty point we oft'ner gain, Than talking in severer strain. The writers of the Comic cast, Who wrote their plays some ages past, Their works on this foundation rear, And all are imitable here. But these Hermogenes the beau, And ape Demetrius did not know, Which last, not learning better things, Still Calvus and Catullus sings.— But this Lucillius cou'd atchieve A mighty feat, and interweave His Latin with a deal of Greek.— O ye late-learn'd, and still to seek— To think ought wonderful or hard, Performed ev'n by the Rhodian bard!— But yet, they cry, the stile combin'd Of diff'rent tongues is more refin'd; As Chian wine is always best, Well mixt with the Falernian zest. Now let me fairly ask your muse, If for your subject you shou'd choose Petillus his intangled case, Wou'd you forget your native place And Roman sire, to inter-lard Words taken from a foreign bard? And ape the Canusinian folk, Where only broken Latin's spoke, Tho' Pedius and Corvinus sweat With zeal, and a great pattern set. To me one time about to speak, And write my verses all in Greek, Tho' born upon th'Italian coast At midnight Romulus his ghost Appear'd, the hour that dreams are true, My scheme forbidding to pursue: “The plan wou'd be as wise and good, “To carry timber to the wood, “As to augment th'enormous throng “Of Grecian books in prose and song.” While puff't Alpinus blows his blast, And butchers Memnon in bombast, Or Rhine with muddy head displays, I sport with these satiric lays; Which nor in Phœbus' temple dare Be shewn, if Tarpa shou'd be there, Nor in the play-house give delight, Nor have a run from night to night. You, O Fundanius! far surpass All moderns of the comic class, While you th'arch dialogue repeat, How Davus and the doxy cheat That old huncks Chremes—Pollio sings In lively verse the deeds of kings; Varius is masterly and strong, Unrival'd in th'heroic song Virgil had not then published the Æneid.; While all the Muses of the field, The delicate and pleasant yield To Virgil—writings of this strain, Which Varro cou'd attempt in vain, And certain others, I pretend In some degree to recommend, But of inferior rank in Rome To him, th' Lucillius. original, from whom I shall not dare to pluck the bays, That crown his head with so much praise.— But I objected that his song, Flow'd oft so muddily along, That the more part of what he said Shou'd rather be eras'd, than read. Well! well! do you so great a clerk, No fault in Homer's self remark? Does not Lucillius revise In wagg'ry Accius' comedies? And laugh at Ennius as too free, With his poetic gravity, When ev'n his noble self he names No better, than the men he blames?— What in like manner can impede But I, who this Lucillius read, May make enquiry, as I go, Which was the real cause, to know, His subject's nature, or his own, That he no better skill has shown, Nor lets his numbers smoother glide, Than if a man shou'd take a pride The measure with six feet to close, And lines by hundreds to compose, Before he sits him down to eat, And then as many after meat. Such was the Cassius (not Severus) but another poet of that name. Tuscan poet's trade, With genius fierce as a cascade, Whose works gave fuel for the fire, Upon his own funereal pyre. But grant Lucillius form'd to write, At once the hum'rous and polite, More learn'd than Ennius every piece, The sire of verse unknown to Greece, And more correct in ev'ry page, Than poets of the earlier age— Yet he (continued to our day) Much from himself had par'd away, And prun'd off every useless shoot, On which was neither song nor fruit; And in the tuning of his wit, Had often scratch'd his head, and bit His nails, in an extatic fit. You that wou'd write a taking strain, And worthy to be read again, Oft turn your style in act to blot, Nor care if crouds admire, or not, Content with readers more select— What wou'd you foolishly affect, To have your verses taught in schools, To shew poor boys the grammar-rules? Not I—for whom it will suffice, If knights allow my works the prize; As in contempt of all the rest, The hiss'd An actress. Arbuscula profess'd. Me shall the gnat Pantilius fret, Or shall I feel a thought's regret, That by Demetrius I am spurn'd, As soon as e'er my back is turn'd. Or that Hermogenes's friend, Weak Fannius loves to discommend— May Plotius, Varius, and the Knight Of Tuscany, praise what I write? And Virgil, Valgius, and that best Of men Octavius, with the rest; And Fuscus I cou'd wish indeed, And either Viscus wou'd accede! And here with no ambitious view, O Pollio! I cou'd mention you, Messala, and his brother too; On Servius, Bibulus insist, And candid Furnius in my list: With many more, whom learn'd and dear, I wittingly insert not here. These only, and the like of these, I do desire my works shou'd please, Such as they are, and shall be griev'd, If my fond hope shou'd be deceiv'd. Avaunt Demetrius, and the fool Tigellius to the singing-school, There snivel 'midst your female tribe— Ho! quick, my boy, these lines transcribe. THE SECOND BOOK OF THE SATIRES OF HORACE. SATIRE I. [There are to whom my lines appear] He sets forth the advice given him by Trebatius, in respect to writing the atchievements of Augustus, rather than Satires, and gives his reasons why he cannot follow it. There are to whom my lines appear Far too satiric and severe, As driving things too great a length— Others conceive there is no strength In any thing I sing or say, And that a thousand lines a day May be spun out, if such as mine— Trebatius, what do you opine?— Be quiet—you advise, I see, That I shou'd leave off poetry— —Aye—may I make a sorry end, If you are not my worthiest friend, But then I cannot rest, but start A nights—why, if your sleep depart, Good oiling is the best advice, There is a passage in Cicero which mentions Trebatius as extravagantly fond of swimming; his advice to Horace is therefore very natural.And then to swim cross Tiber thrice, Or take strong liquor in your head, Some hours before you go to bed. But if so great an itch to write Infect you—stand forth to recite Augustus an unconquer'd Lord, Sure to acquire a vast reward— Old boy—tho' fervent be my zeal, Yet I inferior skill must feel; Nor can a common pen presume To draw the troops, which horrors plume, And Gauls from shiver'd darts, that bleed, And Parthian dying off his steed. —Yet you might paint him just and brave, The character Lucillius gave To Scipio, and was therefore wise— I'll not be hindmost for the prize, Cou'd I bring things to have a face: Unless in proper time and place The words of Horace will not speed, To make a mighty chief give heed, Who like a horse, when strok'd too hard Will kick, at all times on his guard.— —Yet better this—than to defame Pantolabus of merry name, And Nomentanus, son of shame; While all men fear you and detest, Ev'n those, not yet the public jest.— What shall I do? the dance is led By brisk Milonius, when his head Is hot, and all the lights augment; Castor with horses is content, But he that sprung from the same shell, Prefers to box, or wrestle well. For many men of many minds— My spirit consolation finds To scribble verses, on the plan Lucillius chose, a better man Than you or I can boast to be, Whether in genius or degree. He, as to faithful friends, he chose, Did to his books his mind disclose, And this was his amusement still, If his affairs went well or ill. Whence the whole tenor of his days, His own descriptive page displays, As if, enjoy'd or undergone, His life were in a picture drawn. Him follow I—no matter whom You're please to call me here in Rome, Lucanian, or Apulian wight, For all Venusium has a right The borders of them both to plough; A race (as old records allow) Were sent, and this same country held, What time the Sabines were expell'd, To such intent, that station'd here, They might keep guard on this frontier, If an Apulian disobey'd, Or fierce Lucanian shou'd invade. But this same pointed style of mine, Shall not hurt any by design, And like a scabbard-loving sword, Mere personal defence afford; For why shou'd I my weapon draw, Secure from knaves against the law! O sire and sov'reign Jove on high, Grant this my steel in rust may lie, Nor any person make a breach, Upon the peace I love and teach! But he, who such a deed shall dare, (I give due warning to forbear) Shall rue, and be a song and jest Thro' all the city in request.— If Cervius you to wrath inflame, He threats to take the law—the dame, Albucius keeps, with poison fights: Judge Turius all his foes affrights, Who can such damages denounce— Thus how all creatures crack and bounce Against their foes with all their force, As nature orders in her course, Observe with me—The wolf with fangs, The bull with horns will give you pangs, Whence but by instinct?—to the care Of rakish Scæva, who is heir, Shou'd you his long-liv'd mother lend, His pious hand will not offend. Strange! but upon the very plan, That wolves will never kick a man, Nor bullock bite you, if he can: He'll only take th'old lady off With honey'd hemlock for her cough. But to make short with our debate, Whether a tranquil age await, Or death already be my doom, Poor, wealthy, shou'd I live in Rome, Or be expell'd for God knows what, Whate'er the colour of my lot, I'll still write on—O youth! I fear, You cannot long continue here, But that some favourite bustling slave Of state, will send you to your grave:— What if the bold Lucillius durst, To make these kind of verses first, And all that borrow'd skin to bare, Which make th'external man seem fair, Tho' foul within—Did Lælius blame, Or who from Afric won his name! Griev'd they at what Metellus hurt, Or Lupus tumbl'd in the dirt. But he cou'd at the great ones gibe, And lash the people tribe by tribe; As he profess'd to favour none, But Virtue and her friends alone. With him when Scipio brave and great, And Lælius gentle and sedate, Retir'd into the rural scene, And went to sport upon the green, And strip'd them of their robes, and toil'd At tennis, till the sallad boil'd. Whate'er I am, tho' something worse Than him in genius and in purse, Envy must own, till she be griev'd, That with the great I am receiv'd, And aiming with the file to deal, Will break her teeth against the steel, Unless, learn'd Sir, you should dissent— —No, on the whole I am content. But that you may be upon guard, And lest you push your fun too hard, Thro' inexperience in the laws, You must observe there is a clause, “If any man bad verse devise, “His neighbour's fame to scandalize, “He may be cast—an action lies.”— Granted—bad verse—but if my pen Shou'd only write good verse—what then? Shou'd a man send such lines abroad, Judicious Cæsar will applaud, And shou'd he bring a wretch to shame, Himself the while exempt from blame?— The cause will drop—the judges scoff— And you may decently walk off. SATIRE II. [What and how great it is to be] Under the person of Ofellus he inveighs against persons given to luxury: and as he recounts the inconveniencies that attend this high way of living, so he likewise enumerates the benefits which are in a moderate and frugal diet. What and how great it is to be A pattern of œconomy; (Nor is this doctrine fairly mine, But what Ofellus wou'd injoin, A rustic without learning taught, And wise by downright strength of thought) Learn, my good friends, while I debate, But not amongst a glare of plate, When the maz'd eye is at a loss, And mind mis-judges, dup'd by gloss, But here, while fasting, let us weigh— Why so?—I'll tell you, if I may— A judge corrupted with a fee, Cannot the truth so clearly see; If after hunting of the hare, Or gall'd by some unruly mare, Or Roman The manual exercise of the sword and spear. Manual make you weak, As you are us'd to To be effeminate. play the Greek, Or while the rapid ball recoils, The heat of contest cheat your toils, Or if your pleasure is the quoit, You smite the air in that exploit; When exercise has cur'd your squeam, And drougth and hunger are extream, Then let me see you scorn plain fare, Nor for the best Falernian care, Unless there's honey in the wine— Your butler is gone out to dine, And the tempestuous ocean saves The fish, by his black wintry waves, Why then a bit of bread and cheese, The barking stomach will appease. From whence do you think this wisdom's gain'd? Whence this philosophy obtain'd? Not the rich flavour gives delight, The relish is your appetite; Seek, and you'll not be at a loss, By downright exercise for sauce; Nor fowls that fly, nor fish that swim, Can give the least content to him, Who's bloated with th'effects of vice— Yet I might fail, shou'd I intice Your palate to an humble chick, A peacock ent'ring in the nick, Struck by appearance, you regale Upon th'idea of his tail; Scarce bird! that cost the lord knows what, As if that signified a jot. What do you eat those gaudy dies, Which you so much extol and prize, And is the bird as much possess'd Of beauty, when 'tis pluck'd and dress'd. Yet as there is no odds betwixt Their several tastes, the truth is fix'd, That you're deceiv'd by outward shew— Yet grant in this it were not so— By what conjecture can you dive, Whether this pike that gapes alive, Was in main ocean trepann'd Or Tiber, and was thrown to land Between the bridges, or the head From whence the Tuscan river's fed— You ninny, you are apt to praise A mullet that full three pound weighs, Which you must mangle, as a dupe To stupid custom in your soupe. I see appearance is your guide; Why are the pikes so much decried? Because they're of a longer sort, And mullets naturally short. An appetite with hunger keen, Will seldom loath the coarse and clean.— O cou'd I see a banging fish, Extended in a swinging dish, A rav'nous glutton cries aloud, Whose maw might make a harpy proud! But, O ye blasts! that taint the air, Come blow upon their luscious fare; Tho' there's no mighty need of you, Since both the boar and turbot too, First taken are offence to them, Whose stomach now o'ercharg'd with phlegm Prefer the rising food to curb, The turnip, and the acid herb. Yet still at sumptuous boards we see Some traits of old oeconomy; Ev'n to this day eggs first appear, And the black olives in the rear— But now the table of the Gallonius, an infamous gutler, of whom see Cic. lib. ii. de finibus. Cry'r, Did most notoriously aspire, Exhibiting a sturgeon whole— Had sea no turbot, nor a sole? The turbot late was undistress'd, And safe the stork within her nest, Until th'exploded Prætor taught, That they might be devour'd and caught; Wherefore if any fool shou'd boast, That cormorants were good to roast, So fond of lies, the Roman youth Wou'd all receive it as a truth. But if Ofellus we retain As judge, there's difference again, Betwixt the sordid and the plain. For pomp and pride in vain you shun, If you to downright meanness run. Avidienus, whom they call A cur, in justice after all, Eats olives, which have fairly stood Five years, and cornels of the wood, And even spares his wine to pour Into the cup, till chang'd and sour: Then for his oil, you cannot bear The scent, (tho' 'tis some great affair He celebrates in white array, His birth, perhaps, or wedding-day) By his own hand it is distill'd, From horn that holds two pounds when fill'd, Upon the cabbage—but for tart He is no niggard, and can part From vinegar with all his heart! What food then shall a wise man use, And which of this examples choose! For difficulties press around, And here's the wolf, and there's the hound. He shall be neat who does not sin In nastiness, and keeps within Due bounds, no wretch on either side, Who will not imitate the pride Of old Albucius, who raves, When'er he's tasking of his slaves— Nor will he bear for want of thought, That greasy water shou'd be brought, As noodle Nævius serves his guest, Which is as bad as all the rest. Now hear how many and how great The comforts that spare meals await— First then there is your health preserv'd, For various things, when they are serv'd, You well may think can do no good, When you reflect upon the food, So well digested when a boy, Too simple to offend or cloy. But when you once begin your tricks, And boil'd and roast together mix, And fish and foul—the sweetest juice Will turn to bile by gross abuse, And the tough phlegm, that forms and stays, Will tumults in your stomach raise. Observe how pale the guests arise From courses of varieties; Besides the body overpower'd With what you yesternight devour'd, Afflicts the mind, and brings to shame, Your portion of th'etherial flame. Another, who but plainly fed Springs active to his early bed, Betimes arises fresh and gay, For all the duties of the day. But he sometimes may have recourse To better cheer without remorse, At some great festal revolution, Or on defect of constitution, When weakness comes, and years implore More tender usage than before. But as for you, if sickness come, Or creeping old-age shou'd benumb, What kind indulgence can be lent, Which you in youth and strength prevent. A rancid boar our fathers chose, And yet these Romans had a nose. But I presume this was their view, That for a visitor or two, At times they'd take it from their shelves, Rather than eat it all themselves. O that I had been born and nurst, Amongst such heroes at the first! Come are your ears for fame inclin'd, The more than music of the mind, Plate, turbots, e'en such show and cheer Are scandalous as well as dear: To all these items you may add, Your uncle, and your neighbours mad, Desp'rate yourself, and without hope Of death, or credit for a rope.— That Trasius, (you'll be apt to urge) With these invectives you may scourge, But I have very great estates, Enough to keep three potentates. Why therefore do you not prepare A fund of what you have to spare? Why shou'd one good man be distress'd, While you are of such wealth possess'd? Why do the holy temples fall, Ingrate! have you no love at all For native Rome? but she may reap A little, from your monst'rous heap.— Must thou alone be still exempt, O object of your foes contempt Hereafter—which shall best confide In his own heart, when he is tried, He who has us'd to more than due, His pamper'd mind and body too, Or who with meaner things content, Prepar'd and cautious of event, In wisdom knows what peace is for, And hoards supplies against a war. But that my doctrine may appear More acceptable, you shall hear— I knew Ofellus, when a boy, Who did not formerly enjoy With more expence his lands intire, Than now oblig'd those lands to hire. There may you see him walk about In fields with elegance laid out, Stout farmer, tho' his rent be large, With wife and children, all his charge, Having such things as these to say: “I never on a common day, “Ought more than herbs and bacon eat, “But when compell'd a friend to treat, “After long interval receiv'd, “Or when from all our toils reliev'd, “A neighbour, whom the tempest drives, “Most acceptable guest arrives— “Then we liv'd well, but not so high, “As fishes ev'n from Rome to buy: “But pullets, or a kid was caught; “And for the second course they brought “Some grapes, for raisins, hung and dried, “With nuts, and a few figs beside. “After this fare we had a A game like snip, snap, snorum. play, “To take our glass in turn, or pay. “Then Ceres by our vows ador'd, “A plenteous harvest to afford, “Smil'd on our jovial cup, to chace “The wrinkles of each serious face. “Let fortune rage, new broils foment, “What more 'gainst me can she invent? “Have I my boys more sparing been, “Or have we gone less tight and clean, “Since the new lord has here been seen? “For nature has appointed none, “To call an earthly thing his own, “Nor him, nor me, nor any third— “He drove us out by war preferr'd; “To him his conduct past all shame, “Or quirks in law shall do the same, “Or heir surviving after all— “This field Umbrenus's they call, “Which lately did to me pertain, “For none long while shall it remain— “But still be ceded to the plea “Of any person, you or me— “Wherefore act bravely, and oppose “A manly heart to worldly woes.” SATIRE III. [Your works so seldom now appear] He introduces Damasippus accusing him, that he wrote nothing; and then under the same person he handles that paradox of the Stoics, viz. that all fools are mad. Your works so seldom now appear, You scarcely wrote four times a year; Employ'd your poems to retouch, And wroth you have indulg'd so much In wine and sleep, till all your lays Are far beneath the public praise. What now? you come here with a view, The feast of Saturn to eschew— So now you're sober, drive your trade, And keep the promise that you made. Begin—there is no let at all, In vain you blame your pen, and scrawl Upon the harmless, helpless wall. And yet your features were intent, As pregnant with some huge event, If once you compass'd your retreat To leisure, and your country-seat, What boots it to make such ado With Plato and Menander too, To bring down Eupolis to us, And that great bard Archilochus; If you shall think to silence spite, By quitting valour and the fight, They'll call you a most wretched wight. That siren indolence divorce, Or you must lose all fame of course, You gain'd in better days of yore— —O Damasippus! I implore All male and female pow'rs above, For your good council and your love, A shaver for your beard to send; But whence are you so much my friend, And see so deep in my affairs?— To other men I give my cares, By no concerns of self controul'd, E'er since my goods were 'prais'd and sold; For formerly my chief employ, Was to be curious in a toy, And at th'identic vase I guess'd, Corinthian Sisyphus possess'd. What cut without the master's hand, And what too roughly cast, I scan'd, As connoisseur for such a head, Some thousand sesterces I bled. I was the only man, that knew To buy fine seat and gardens too, And that to such advantage, Sir, That I was call'd the Manager, Both in the streets and at the 'change— I know it, and to me 'tis strange, So frantic you shou'd e'er get well— Some new disorders came t'expel The old, which sometimes is the case, When pain and sickness shift their place, And from the head and sides depart, To make advances on the heart. Or as it is when from his bed The dull lethargic lifts his head, And beats the doctor for his fee— So that you do not this to me, Be things as you wou'd have them be. —Do not deceive yourself, good sir, You're mad, and so are all that err From wisdom mad, or nearly so, If truth our great Stertinius know, From whom these admirable rules I have deriv'd, concerning fools, What time he order'd me to save A sapient beard, and never shave, And speed without concern and pain, From that Fabrician bridge again. For when, as all my wealth was spent, I there for self-destruction went, He very happily stood near, And have a care (says he) for fear You thro' false shame are on a plan, Which is unworthy of a man, Since born amongst the mad-brain'd race, You dread a personal disgrace. First then I will inquire to see What's madness? if alone in thee, I will not add a word, not I But you may bravely plunge and die. Crysippus both his school and sect, Do madness to all men object. For fools of a malicious mind, While ignorant of truth, and blind, Are madmen properly defin'd. In this we comprehend you all Both king and people, great and small, Except the stoic great and wise, Who bade us thus philosophize. Now hear how those, that give to you The name of madman, are so too. As in the woods when people stray, Driv'n by some blunder from the way, If right or left their route's oblique, The error ends to each alike. In such conceive yourself insane, So that another, who is vain, And laughs at you is no less mad, And hangs his hamper'd tail as bad. One kind of folly is to fear All peril, when no hurt is near: So that upon the open lea Fires, rivers, rocks, they seem to see. Another opposite direct, Nor wiser in the least respect: That is thro' floods and flames to fly, Let mistress, mother, sister cry, With all his kindred, and his wife: “This ditch is dreadful—save your life— “This precipice is monstrous steep, “From headlong death your footsteps keep.” He wou'd not hear or be controul'd, Better than Catienus performed Polydore, and Fusius Ilione, in a tragedy of that name written by Pacuvius. Fusius was only to have shammed to be asleep, which being drunk, he was in earnest. Fusius did of old, When he was drunk to that degree, He overslept Ilione, The while two hundred thousand roar, “Hear, mother, hear thy Polydore.” Now I shall shew you, that the case, Is parallel with all our race. If Damasippus is unwise, For ancient bustos, that he buys, Are they that lend him money sane? Well be it so—but to explain. Here, sir, receive, if I shou'd say, That which you never can repay, Is't mad to take me at my word, Or wou'd you not be more absurd, To spare the purse and its contents, Which lucky Mercury presents. Grant that to Nerius there are due Ten thousand pieces—'twill not do. Add then a million forms and ties, That quaint Cicuta can devise: Yet Proteus shifting off his shape, Shall all these chains and bars escape, And when you drag him into court, With your misfortunes making sport, At pleasure boar, or bird, or rock, Or oak he'll be to stand the shock. Misconduct if his want of sense, And care to wisdom claims pretence. Perillius forward to advance The sum, for which he stands no chance, Is of a head by far more weak Than thee, if I my mind may speak. Whome'er ambitious thoughts assail, Who are with watching money pale, Who for luxurious viands pants, Or sour with superstition cants, Or finds his intellectual man At all impair'd, come rear and van To me, your most especial friend; Adjust your garments and attend, While I demonstrate to your face, That madness is your common case. First to the avaritious tribe, Most hellebore I must prescribe: Perhaps, these wretches with their hoards, Claim all Anticyra affords. Staberius' heirs were forc'd to write, The sum he left in black and white Upon his tomb, for on neglect They were injoin'd to this affect: That they shou'd to the mob bestow An hundred fencers, for a show, With a grand banqueting beside, Ev'n such as Arrius shou'd provide, With as much corn as in a year, The fields of fertile Afric bear: “Whether you deem that this my will “Be right or wrong, yet pray fulfill, “Nor on my mem'ry be too hard.” The man, I think, was on his guard. What therefore do you think he dreamt, When he commanded on contempt, His heirs upon his tomb shou'd grave The money he was said to have. Know then, while yet alive, he sneer'd At want, as vice, which most he fear'd, So that he all wou'd self deny, Lest one mite poorer he shou'd die. For all things, virtue, fame, and grace, Divine and human must give place To wealth, which if one can acquire, He's just, fam'd, brave, and sov'reign sire, With all things else he can desire. These heaps, as if for merits gain He thought wou'd to his land remain.— With him, how little of a piece, Was Aristippus sprung from Greece, Who made his slaves by his commands, Disperse his gold on Lybian sands? As going slowly on the road, Encumber'd with so great a load. Which is the madder of the two— —An instance here will little do, Which strives to help a question out, By bringing up another doubt.— If any man shou'd buy guittars, And keep them up with locks and bars, Unskill'd the lyre or lute to use, And wholly inscious of the muse; Or be worth many a last and awl, That is no shoemaker at all; Or sails and ropes a fool shou'd hoard, Who never dar'd to go aboard, Why sure delirious and unsound, He wou'd by all his peers be found. And now I wou'd be told is he From such-like imputations free, Who dreads to use his hoarded plate, And money, as if consecrate. Shou'd any person stand before, A heap of corn upon his floor, And arm'd upon the watch remain, Yet dare not take a single grain, And tho' his heart with hunger grieves, Had rather fare upon dry leaves— Or shou'd a thousand casks possess, From Chian or Falernian press, Nay more, three hundred thousand say, And yet drink vinegar all day. Again, shou'd one of sev'nty-nine, Lie down on straw, tho' on his line The bedding rot, and in his chest The food of moths and worms at best, Yet few wou'd hold him as possest. Because the bulk of all mankind, Are equally absurd and blind. Thou dotard scorn'd in heav'n and here, Do you still watch your wealth, for fear Of want yourself, when in the end, Your son and servant all shall spend? For what a trifle wou'd each day, Take from your capital away, Shou'd you once venture to produce, Some better oil from out your cruise; Both for your cabbage and your hair, Uncomb'd, and scurf'd for want of care? If any pittance will suffice, For what are all your oaths and lies, Why do your frauds and thefts abound In ev'ry quarter? are you sound? If you shou'd be so indiscreet, To pelt the mob along the streets, Or use, the slaves you bought, as bad, Each boy and girl wou'd call you mad. You hang your wife, and in despight Your mother poison, are you right? For why? because you did not do The fact at the same place, nor drew The sword to perpetrate your shame, As mad Orestes slew the dame? Think you his madness did proceed, Merely from this flagitious deed, Or that he was not rather wrought By furies, e'er he ev'n in thought Cou'd cut his mother's throat—but stay— Ev'n from the time that you wou'd say, A dang'rous fit had seiz'd her son, Nought reprehensible was done. He did not dare Electra seize, Nor draw his sword on Pylades, He only his hot wrath to vend, Call'd her a fury, and his friend Some other most outrageous name, Which from his indignation came. Opimius, who amidst his hoard, Cou'd nothing to himself afford, Who us'd to drink from potter's clay An exceeding bad wine. Veientan, on a holiday, While dregs, or any kind of stuff, Were for a work-day well enough, Was lately seiz'd, and like to die Of a prodigious lethargy, In such that his triumphant heir, With eager joy already there, About his keys and coffers ran— His doctor, a most active man, And faithful too, did thus contrive The means his patient to revive, He bade them bring the table out, And throw the money bags about, Then certain came to count the pelf— Which, rais'd at once, he did himself. Then thus the doctor spake, “beware, “Or all goes to your greedy heir;” What, while I am living?—“if you chuse “To live, you must the methods use, “Watch—bustle,” what wou'd you persuade? “Why your poor body's so decay'd, “Unless your stomach is renew'd, “Your veins will fail for lack of food— “Why do you hesitate, th'advice “Is good, here take this bowl of rice:” What cost it? “never mind the price;” But what I say? “three farthings;” oh! What signifies which way I go, Whether I die of my disease, Or rapine, theft, and doctor's fees.— Who therefore is quite sane and cool? Why ev'ry man, that's not a fool, What is the churl? give him his due, He is both fool and madman too. But say a person is not near, Are therefore his conceptions clear? By no means in the world—why so, Good master Stoic?—you shall know; Suppose that An eminent physician. Craterus shou'd tell This patient, that his heart is well. Is he then right, and shall he rise? The doctor certainly denies, If in his reins, or either side, The poignant symptoms still abide. This person is quite clear of both, The miser's crime, and breach of oath. Let him then sacrifice a swine, In honour to the pow'rs divine— But he is vain and bold—away Conduct him to A place famous for the growth of hellebore. Anticyra. For what's the diff'rence in th'abuse, Whether you waste your wealth profuse, Or let it have no end or use? Opidius Servius, rich and great, In an old family estate Divided (as the story runs) Two of his farms betwixt his sons, And when upon his dying bed He call'd his sons, and thus he said— “Aulus, when thee a little lad, “I saw so free with what you had, “And bear more losely than the rest “Your nuts, and play-things in your breast, “Which you wou'd give or game away— “Thee too, Tiberius, when at play, “I mark'd to count your toys, and hide; “I fear'd lest both there shou'd betide “A phrenzy, of a diff'rent cast, “Lest he shou'd learn to live too fast “Of Nomentanus, and that you “Might, like the scrub Cicuta, do; “Wherefore, by all the Gods adjur'd, “Let me have each of you secur'd; “Aulus, lest all by you be spent— “Tiberius, or that you augment “Too much, what in your father's sense “And nature, is a competence. “Besides lest glory with its glare “Beguile you, both of you shall swear, “That he who shall be Edile first, “Or Prætor, be cut off and curst. “Wou'd you destroy your wealth and ease, “By largesses of Distributed by way of bribery to the populace on elections. beans and pease, “That in the Circus you may strut “At large, or have your statue cut, “And there in brazen dulness stand, “A dupe depriv'd of cash and land? “Yes, you wou'd have Agrippa's praise— “A silly fox that over-plays “His cunning, nor can have the heart “To act the lion's noble part.” Atrides, whence the royal word, That Ajax shou'd not be interr'd? “I am a king,”—as you think fit, Born a plebeian I submit. “And just was the severe decree, “Which if you do not clearly see, “You have my leave to speak your mind.” Great king, may all the gods combin'd, Grant you from conquer'd Troy to make A happy voy'ge—so I may take The liberty of pro and con, To ask and to reply—“Go on.”— Then why does Ajax so renown'd, And only to Achilles found Inferior, rot above the ground? Oft fam'd for faving yours and you, That Priam, and his people too, May triumph in his fate and shame, That made their youths endure the same. “So great the phrenzy of his brain, “By him a thousand sheep were slain, “Which at the time he thought to be “My brother, and my friends and me.” When thou humanity's disgrace, At Aulis didst thy daughter place Before the shrine, and on her head The consecrated salt you shed, Cou'd you a man of sense be said? “Why not?”—why what did Ajax do. “Who without cause the mutton slew.”— Why he abstain'd from wife and child, Tho' each Atrides he revil'd: He hurt not Teucer in his rage, Nor with Ulysses did engage. “To loose my fleet from th'hostile shore “Wise I appeas'd the gods with gore.”— What with your own, thou madman?—“yea— “But mad not in the least degree.” Who'er false images has built, Form'd in the hurry of his guilt, Will be esteem'd disturb'd in mind, Nor does it boot what he's defin'd, Or fool or furious—Ajax doats, Who harmless sheep to death devotes: He who for empty fame commits An horror, is he in his wits? And is your wicked heart allied, To purity, when swoln with pride? If any man shou'd in his chair, Conduct a lamb to take the air, And for her maids, gold, garments get, And call it bantling or pusette, And ev'n design her for the bed Of some stout youth, to such a head, The Prætor wou'd without delay, All conduct of itself gainsay; And give up to his friends and heirs, The management of his affairs. What if a sire his girl depute, A victim for the bleating mute, Are his brains right?—no, 'twill not suit. Wherefore whenever in one mind Are folly and perverseness join'd, There's rank insanity, for sin And raving madness are a-kin. Fond of frail fame, the warrior's pains, End in the cracking of his brains. Come on—let Nomentanus bear The lash, that is the squand'rer's share: For reason this conclusion makes, None are more mad than foolish rakes. This fellow, after he was paid A thousand talents, instant made An edict, that next morn for state, The fruit'rer, fishmonger shou'd wait, The poult'rer and perfumer too, The play'rs, with that indecent crew That traffic in the Much such another place as Drury-lane. Tuscan street, With all that dealt in oil or meat. Well what was the event?—they came. The bawd the first began to frame His speech, “whatever I or these “Possess at home, is, if you please “Your own, which you may take away, “Alike to-morrow, or to-day.” Now hear with what benign concern, The youth bespeaks them in his turn. “In boots upon Lucanian snows, “You take a comfortless repose, “That I may sup upon a boar, “You fish upon the wintry shore. “I pass my time without employ, “This wealth unworthy to enjoy. “Here take ye, every one your due— “A million sesterces for you; “For you as much; for you twice-told, “With whose fair spouse I make so bold, “When to my call at midnight sold. Æsopus' son by folly taught, To waste a million at a draught, Dissolv'd in vinegar a pearl, He ravish'd from his fav'rite girl; Not one jot wiser to be sure, Than if he'd thrown it in the sew'r. The boys of Arrius, curious twins, In trifles as enormous sins, Were wont on nightingales to feed At any price—say, was their deed Of sense or fondness, and of right, To be put down in black or white? If once you see a grey-beard take To toys, and baby-houses make, Yoke mice to go-carts, pebbles hide, To play at odd and even, ride About the house upon a cane, You'd think his phrenzy very plain. If it's as childish as all this In reason's eye, to love a miss, And that it matters not, if you Play in the dust, as wont to do When three years old, or shou'd deplore Your fate in fondness to a whore. I ask you if you will behave Like Polemo, when drunken and crowned with chaplets, went into the school of Xenocrates, who happened to be upon the topic of temperance, to which the young rake gave such attention, that he became perfectly reformed, insomuch, that he lived to succeed the philosopher in his school. Polemo reform'd, and wave The ensigns of your fond disease, Your mantle, garters below knees, And lac'd cravat, as it is said He did with liquor in his head, And took by stealth his chaplet off, Converted by th'abstemious soph. If to a boy that's cross in grain You offer apples, he'll refrain— “Here take them, little rogue.”—Not I— But if they are not giv'n he'll cry. A whining lover in disgrace, Barr'd out is in the self-same case. When with himself he argues so, Whether he shall, or shall not go, Unto the place for which he steers, Altho', unsent for, and adheres Ev'n to the hated threshold—“What! “When dunn'd to see her, shall I not? “Or shall I not myself befriend, “And rather all my sorrows end? “Shut out—recall'd—shall I repeat “My suit—no—shou'd she at my feet “Implore me;”—lo! the servant here, Whose head's a thousand times more clear— “O Sir, in things that have no mean, “Our conduct cannot be foreseen, “And govern'd by a rule and form: “In love these contradictions swarm— “War—peace anon, which as they veer “Like fortune or the atmosphere, “If any one to fix shou'd try, “He'd do no better, by the bye, “Than if he rav'd and play'd the fool “By gamut, or by grammar-rule.” When taking from Picenian fruit, The seeds you to the cieling shoot, It gives you joy—are you yourself? Or when you act a fondling elf In impotence, and lisp, and toy, Are you then wiser than a boy Who builds dirt-houses, as he plays? How think you too of bloody frays, And stirr'd by swords how fire will blaze! When Marius, who had Hellas smote, Did death unto himself devote, Was he then mad, or will you free The culprit from his lunacy, And so condemn him for the fact By being in your terms exact? A wretch in years, a freedman's son, Was seen about the streets to run With washen hands, at early day, And “me alone, (for that I pray, “Is no great thing for pow'rs like you, “Ye Gods, which all with ease can do) “Save me alone from death and hell.” This man in eyes and ears was well, But him if e'er his lord should sell, He must his intellects exclude, Unless he wanted to be sued. Such (says Chrysippus) must be clast 'Mongst numbers of A crazy person of a numerous family. Menenian cast. “O thou! that giv'st, or canst remove “The worst afflictions, sov'reign Jove!” (Cries the fond mother of a lad, Bed-rid five weeks and very bad) “If this cold quartan shall recede “The first day, that a fast's decreed, “In Tiber naked shall he stand.”— Shou'd luck, or some physician's hand, From dang'rous case restore the boy, The mother will herself destroy, By stripping him in frantic vein, And bringing back the fit again. How driv'n to such a foolish freak? Why superstition makes her weak. These instances, attacks to stave, That eighth wise man Stertinius gave In friendship, that some future day I might the Cavillers repay. Whoever calls me mad, shall hear The same re-echoed in his ear, And be compell'd to turn his mind, Upon the Alluding to a fable of Æsop, where Jupiter is feigned to have put bags upon every man, the one filled with his neighbour's faults before, the other filled with his own behind, so that he sees the former, but not the latter. bag, that hangs behind. Stoic (so may you re-imburse Your damages and make a purse) Of what infatuation, pray, (Since there are many kinds you say) Am I by thee as guilty found For to myself I seem quite sound. When mad Agave bears the head Of her unhappy son, that bled By her own hands, does she conceive Herself a fury?—give me leave, I'll own the truth, I am a fool, And in my senses not quite cool, Only speak out, and tell me all That I particularly ail—I shall— First you're a builder, that's to vie With giants, tho' but two feet high. Yet you the self same dwarf deride When little Turbo's strut and pride In armour far too big you see— Pray are you less a jest than he? What if Mæcenas built in Rome, Must such a chap as you presume 'Gainst all propriety, so small, And so dissimilar withal? The young ones of an absent frog, Crush'd by a bull-calf in the bog, The mother was inform'd by one That 'scap'd what an huge beast had done. She asks him of the monster's size, And puffing up herself she cries, “Was he so great?” as great again— Then after many a grievous strain, “Was he as big as this?” indeed You wou'd not, shou'd you burst, succeed. This little piece, that Esop drew, Bears a strong likeness, sir, to you. Now introduce your odes and lyre, That is, add fewel to the fire, The verses, which from men of sense If e're they come, you've some pretence. I do not name your desp'rate wrath— Have done—and greater than your cloth Your coat—my philosophic friend, Pray to your own affairs attend, And those that nearer reason rave Thou maddest of all mad-men wave. SATIRE IV. [From whence arriv'd, and where away] Under the person of one Catius, an Epicurean philosopher, he derides the precepts of that sect, so far as they relate to the culinary art. From whence arriv'd, and where away Good Catius?—Sir, I cannot stay— In haste some maxims to set down, Form'd to out-rival the renown And works of Plato's learned ease, Pythagoras and Socrates— I own myself a little rude, At such a juncture to intrude With interruptions indiscreet; But pardon me, I do intreat. If any thought you lost, you'll find, So great the presence of your mind, Whether 'tis nature, or mere skill, You're great in both, a wit at will. —But I am lab'ring might and main, How I might every thing retain, As matters to refinement wrought, Both in the diction and the thought— The name of him you thus applaud, Is he of Rome, or from abroad?— The author's rules shall be reveal'd, Which I can do; his name conceal'd. Eggs that are oblong, pray observe, Are better at a feast to serve, As being more delicious found, And likewise whiter than the round; Besides the toughness of the skin, Premises a male-yolk within. The greens that grew in drier land, Are sweeter far than those at hand. In over-water'd gardens shoot The flashy and insipid root. If on the even-tide a guest Comes unawares—why then 'tis best (Lest the tough hen for want of youth Offend his palate and his tooth) Live in mix'd wine her body steep— All this is learning very deep. The meadow mushroons are the best: I cannot warrant all the rest. His summers he in health shall spend, Who of his dinner makes an end, With mulberries of blacker die, Gather'd before the sun's too high. Aufidius with Falernian wine Mix'd honey—wrong—as I opine: Because on empty veins 'tis fit Th'emollient only we commit. With more propriety indeed You'll wash your stomach with soft mead. If you are costive, in that case Limpins and cockles shou'd have place, With sorrel leaves of smaller make, Which with white Coan you shou'd take. The waxing moons, to th'utmost wish, Fill out the lubricating fish. But every sea is not alike Productive of the sorts that strike. The Lucrine muscles far exceed The burret of the Baian breed. Circean oysters win the prize; Crabs at Misenum best arise: But your escallops spreading wide, Are soft Tarentum's boast and pride. Let none presumptuously suppose, The table-decking art he knows, Unless he weigh with previous care The laws of taste—a nice affair. Nor is't enough to clear the stall Of high-pric'd fishes great and small, Unskill'd which sort to stew is right, And which when roasted will invite The gutler, that has over-eat Himself, to re-assume his seat. The Umbrian boar with acrons fed, Which from the scarlet oak are shed, The dishes of that person bend, Whose palate flabby meats offend. For poorly the Laurentian feeds, As fatted up with flags and reeds. A connoisseur will be aware, To chuse the wings of pregnant hare. Of foul and fish the sorts and age, Tho' studied much by many a sage, Has not as yet been fully known, But by my skill and taste alone. Some men exhaust their time and taste In new inventions upon paste. 'Tis not worth labour to discuss Upon a single point, as thus, Shou'd a man merely rest on this, That his wine may not drink amiss, Careless what oil she shou'd supply, When he has any fish to fry. Shou'd you put out the Massic wine, (The weather being very fine) If it be foul, the air by night Will make it clear, and banish quite That smell bad for the nerves—but drawn And filtred thro' a sieve of lawn, 'Twill all its zest intirely lose. He, who shall skillfully infuse To wine of Surrentinian kind, The right Falernian lees, will find That he can best collect the dregs, By making use of pidgeons eggs; Because the yolks, as they descend, Will make the grosser parts attend. With roasted shrimps, and cockles live From Afric's coast you may revive The weary toper—for when sour'd With too much wine, and over-pow'r'd, Lettuce will on the stomach rise, Which seeks the rather for supplies From sausage, ham, or any thing Which from the slattern-shops they bring. You'll find 'tis far from any loss Of time, to learn two kinds of sauce. The plain is made of oil intire, Which to improve and render high'r, Add wine and pickles, best by far When taken from Byzantian jar. This mixt with shredded greens, and brought From Corycus, with saffron fraught, When it has boil'd and stood—then squeeze The olives of Venafran trees. The apples of Picenum beat, What Tibur bears, as good to eat, But for their colour these excel, Venutian grapes for jars are well. Yet for preserving in the smoke Th'Albanian fitter are bespoke. Th'invention was intirely mine, This grape with apples to combine, And vinous lees with herring brine. I was the first who had the knack White pepper with the salt that's black Finely to mix, and serve up all In dishes very neat, tho' small. 'Tis a grand fault to throw away Vast sums upon a market day, And yet to cramp the spraggling fish By using of a scanty dish. 'Twill turn your stomach very much, If waiters take with greasy touch The glass, as they their fingers lick, Or grime to your old goblet stick. In saw-dust, napkins, and in brooms, How small th'expence about your rooms? Yet if these things you quite neglect, 'Tis a most horrible defect. Shou'd you Mosaic pavements sweep, With dirty palm-brooms, as they're cheap, And tho' he is in purple drest, Bring out foul cushions for your guest, Forgetting in such things the less Of care and cost, the greater stress Is still on the defaulter laid, Nor are they in the ballance weigh'd With things of vast expence and state, Pertaining only to the great.— —Learn'd Catius, by the pow'rs divine, That love with which I call you mine, Where'er you shall an audience share With this great man, let me be there, For tho' your mem'ry be so good, That I have most things understood: Yet by mere narrative in brief, You cannot please me like the chief. Then add the manner and the dress, And countenance besides express, Which strike you not in that degree As always in your pow'r to see, But I by vehement desire Up to the fountain-head aspire, And make myself adept compleat In precepts of a life so sweet. SATIRE V. [Besides the things that you have told] Under the person of Ulysses, consulting the ghost of Tiresias, the poet describes the wou'd-be-heirs and will-hunters. Besides the things that you have told, Tiresias, let me be so bold, As your opinion to demand How I the loss of house and land May be enabled to repair By what expedient, art, or care? Why do you laugh?—O fam'd for tricks! Is't not enough your route to fix, That you may Ithaca regain, And in your native country reign? —O thou that never spoke a lie, You see how stript, how poor am I, Returning by your prophecy. Where my wife's suitors I shall find, Nor wealth nor flocks have left behind: But race and virtue without cash, And property are errant trash— —Since poverty so much you dread There is no further to be said: Learn how to flourish in a trice. If any thing that's scarce and nice, A thrush for your own private snack Be sent you, presto! in a crack, The spoil to some old dupe convey, Who lives in the most splendid way, What'er your garden, or your field, Of fruit, or other dainties yield, Let him taste first, a guest by far More venerable than the Lar. And tho' a wretch of upstart pride, A fugitive for laws defied, By perjury or fratricide: Yet if he chuses at his call You must attend, and give the wall— —What cheek by jole, shall I be caught With a vile Dama, filthy thought? Not so still arm'd above my match At Troy I did myself attach— —The sequel, is you must be poor— —This my brave spirit shall endure— And oftentimes I've underwent Fatigues of greater hardiment, Yet prithee, prophet, tell me plain, How I shall cash and substance gain.— —In troth I told you, and repeat The lesson, practise your deceit, To coax old men to make their will, And put you in a codicile. Nor if a cunning knave or two, Shou'd see the hook and bite it thro', Or from your hope recede dismay'd, Or for one blank relinquish trade. If any matter great or small, Be canvass'd in the judgment-hall, Which'er be rich without a child, Tho' he his betters has revil'd, Be you the fav'rer of his cause, And one of honour or applause Despise, and more so, if he house A hopeful son, or breeding spouse. “My Lord—your Grace”—(a title suits And in a drunken ear dilutes) “Me has your virtue made a friend; “I know the law, can points defend. “And they shall rather have my eyes, “Than your great dignity despise, “And with a deaf-nut fob you off: “That you shall have nor loss nor scoff, “Is ever my peculiar care.” Then bid him to his home repair, And cocker up his carcase there. Persist—hold out—your stumps bestir, And be yourself sollicitor. These lines are citations from one Furius Bibaculus, and another bombastic poet. Whether the Dog stars fiery feat Crack poor dumb statues with his heat, Or fat-gut Furius puff and blow, And on the Alpine hills below, Shall disembogue the hoary snow. “Sir, dont you see” (some one will cry Jogging his elbow by the bye) “Your indefatigable friend “So clean the case to comprehend.” With baits like these your plan pursue, More fish will come to stock the stew. Again, if any man shou'd rear (Worth you some hundred pounds a year) An ailing son—left you shou'd seem Too open in your courteous scheme, As batchelor—by slow degrees Creep in and gradual offices, And for the second heir apply So haply, if the lad shou'd die, To all you may yourself advance— This is an admirable chance. Whoever puts into your hand His will to read: at first withstand, And push the parchment rolls aside; Yet let it be obliquely ey'd So as to catch a glance of that, The second item wou'd be at, Whether with many you're coheir, Or come into the whole affair. Full oft some scriv'ner or old fox The gaping crow deludes and mocks, And tho' he's shrewder than the rest Nasica be Coranus' jest— — Ulysses speaks again.What are you mad, or by design Do you obscurities divine— —Ulysses all that I foresee Of surety shall, or shall not be, For from Apollo wise and great, I have obtain'd this skill in fate. —Then, if you please, pray, sir, unveil The mystic meaning of your tale.— What time that youth of race divine, Who from Eneas draws his line, The Parthian's terror shall be crown'd, And both by sea and land renown'd. Nasica known for sneaking ways, Who loves deduction when he pays, They sometimes had a dowry for their daughters, instead of giving a portion with them; so Nasica expected a handsome legacy at least, from a man most probably advanced in years.Shall have his stately girl allied To stout Coranus, as his bride, The son-in-law shall then proceed To the old churl to give the deed, Which, first, he'll frequently refuse, But, being closely press'd, peruse. And while in silent mood he hums, He'll find there's neither sum nor sums, And nothing left for him and his, But leave to make a rueful phiz. To things which we've been led to name, Add also—if a subtle dame Or freed-slave manage an old man, Make one amongst them, if you can. Praise them, that in the self-same strain, You absent may be prais'd again: This helps—but it is best of all By far to storm the Capitol. Does he write verses? sorry stuff? Be sure to praise them well enough. Is he a wencher? do not wait For him to be importunate; But forward of your own accord Your wife to him you call your lord. —What wou'd you intimate that she, The chaste and sage Penelope Can be seduc'd, whom from her course So many suitors cou'd not force?— —The reason is, that youths of thrift Were there still grudging of a gift, A race that chose with stomachs keen The cubbard, rather than the queen. Thus your Penelope is chaste, Who if she once had got a taste Of one old dotard, with a view To share the perquisite with you, No more wou'd startle from her aim, Than a staunch hound will quit his game. The fact that I'm about to tell, When I was old, at Thebes befell. Thus by her will an old hag there Was carried to her grave—the heir With corpse upon his shoulders went Naked and oil'd, to this intent, That she might give the slip at last Tho' dead, to him who stuck so fast. Wherefore be cautious, nothing spare, Likewise by no means over-bear. The splenetic and the morose Will hate the babler as too gross; Nor keep too silent by the bye; Be Davus in the comedy, Stand with your most obsequious head Aside, as in a state of dread. Ply him with complaisant grimace; Pray him to veil his precious face, If once you find the air too brisk, And from the croud at any risk Shoulder him out—and if inclin'd To talk, stick to him ear and mind. If he love praising to excess, Have at him, keep him up and press, Till with his hands to heav'n with wrath He cries, “O 'tis too much in troth.” But keep it up as at the first, Until his tumid bladder burst. When he at last by his decease, Shall give your service full release, And you shall fairly look on this, In certainty of waking bliss, “Ulysses is the heir I name, “To the fourth part of all I claim.” What has my Dama run his race— O where shall I that man replace? Likewise appearances to save, Urge now and then how great and brave! Then cry a little if you will, 'Tis exultation's utmost skill. Nor be, to your direction left, His tomb of elegance bereft. The funeral a concourse draws, With all the neighbourhood's applause. Mean time if one of your coheirs Shou'd think of settling his affairs, As lab'ring with a dang'rous cough, Tell him your ready to cut off Whatever house and farm he likes, And any sum the bargain strikes.— But Proserpine, so stern to drive The Ghosts, recals me—live and thrive. SATIRE VI. [This was the summit of my views] He declares himself to be content with such things as he is possessed of, and that he wishes for no more. This was the summit of my views, A little piece of land to use, Where was a garden and a well, Near to the house in which I dwell, And something of a wood above, The Gods in their paternal love Have more and better sent than these, And, Mercury, I rest at ease, Nor ask I any thing beside, But that these blessings may abide. If I cannot my conscience charge, That I by fraud my wealth enlarge, Nor am about by fond excess To make my little matters less; If I am not a fool in grain, To make such wishes weak and vain, “O that I cou'd that nook command “That mars the beauty of my land! “O where there lies a pot of gold, “Might I by some good God be told! “Like him who having treasure found, “No longer till'd, but bought the ground! “With Hercules so much his friend!”— If for what I possess, or spend, No mean unthankful mind I bear, I supplicate you with this pray'r: May every thing I have be fat, My servants, cattle, dog, and cat, All but my genius—and be still My guardian, if it is your will! Wherefore, when I from town retreat To these my mounts, and lofty seat, How can I of my time dispose Better than in this measur'd prose? Here neither worldly pride destroys, Nor pressure of South wind annoys, Or sickly Autumn, still the gain Of Libitina's baleful reign. O early sire, or Janus hight, (If that name more your ears delight) With whom men all their toils commence In life (for so the Gods dispense) Do thou thyself begin the song— At Rome you hurry me along To give in bail—dispatch me there Lest some one else shou'd do th'affair. Well—tho' aground the North wind blow, Or winter brings the days of snow To shorter compass—I must go— About myself to over-reach— When I in form have made my speech, At once determinate and loud, Why I must bustle in the croud, Sure all slow-walkers to offend— What are you mad? what mean you, friend? (Some swearing fellow's apt to say) You jostle all things in your way, While in post-haste you must be sped, With great Mæcenas in your head— This does, and is too by the bye— A sugar-plumb—I will not lye— But e'er I reach th'Esquilian gloom, I'm charg'd with all th'affairs of Rome. “Roscius desires you, as a friend, “The court-house early to attend; “The clerks beseech you wou'd return, “Upon a thing of vast concern; “Take care Mæcenas seal and sign, “To this same instrument of mine. I will endeavour, shou'd one say, They'll answer, if you will, you may, And still keep urging, as before— 'Tis now the seventh year or more, Since to Mæcenas I was known, And freely number'd as his own, So far as one he chose to raise Just to the honour of his chaise, Conversing as he took his tour, About such trifles—What's the hour? Say is Gallina and Syrus, two great gladiators. Gallina, who's from Thrace, A match for Syrus face to face? These morning frosts are very bad For those who are but thinly clad, Or any thing, that comes in play, Which one to leaky ears may say. E'er since this fortunate event, Th'invidious sons of discontent Daily increase—“This friend of ours, “On whom her favours fortune show'rs; “A place with great Mæcenas claims, “With him was present at the games, “Plays in the field with him at ball.”— Ah, lucky rogue! cries one and all— Does any bad disheart'ning news, Its influence thro' the streets diffuse: Whoe'er I meet consults with me. “Good Sir, (for sure you must be he, “Who all th'affairs of state must know, “As nearer to the gods below) “Ought do you of the Dacians hear?” No—not a syllable—“you jeer:” May all the gods afflict my heart, If I know either whole or part.— “Well—then will Cæsar give the lands, “He promis'd to his chosen bands, “In Sicily or here, I pray?” The more I swear, I cannot say— The more they stare, they cannot sound A man so close and so profound!— Thus do I lose my time and ease, Not without wishes such as these— O rural scenes! when shall I see Your beauties, and again be free Now with those ancient books, I chose With leisure now, and soft repose, In grateful thoughtlessness to drown The anxious business of the town? When shall Pythagoras his beans, With bacon, and well-larded greens Be plac'd before me? O ye nights! Of suppers and divine delights, In which within my proper pale I and my bosom friends regale; And make ev'n saucy slaves partake Of those libations that I make. Each guest according as it suits May take the glass, no one disputes, Whether the strong the bumper chuse, Or weaker chearfully refuse. A conversation then begins Not on our neighbours wealth or sins, Or whether Lepos preference claim For dancing?—but what's more our aim, And what 'tis evil not to know— If happiness from riches flow, Or be not rather virtues prize, And which it is cement the ties Of friendship—rectitude or gain, And what is real good in grain, And how perfection to attain? Mean time my neighbour Cervius prates Old tales, that rise from our debates; For if a man who does not know The world, his elogy bestow On great Arillius cumbrous store He instantly sets off—“Of yore “A country mouse, as it befel, “Received a cit into his cell, “One chrony to another kind “As intimate time out of mind, “This mouse was blunt and giv'n to thrift, “But now and then cou'd make a shift “(However rigid or recluse) “With open heart to give a loose: “In short he wou'd not grudge his guest “Or oats or vetches of the best: “And bringing in some berries dried, “With nibbled scrap of ham beside, “Hop'd he variety might plead “To make his daintiness recede, “For our grandee wou'd scarcely touch “The things, his squeamishness was such.— “Mean time the master of the treat “Extended on clean straw wou'd eat “Nothing but tares and crusts, to spare “For his good friend the nobler fare. “At length the citizen made free “To speak his mind—my friend, (said he) “How can your mouse-ship hold it good, “To live here on a rugged wood, “And how have patience with the place! “Will you not rather turn your face “To view mankind, the town prefer “To these rough scenes that here occur? “Come take my counsel and agree “To make a tour along with me. “Since mortal lives must have an end, “And death all earthly things attend, “Nor is there an escape at all “For man or mouse, for great or small; “Wherefore, good friend, these matters weigh, “And let us for our time be gay, “Let life's contracted period teach “Mice to live jollily”—This speech “Soon as it on the peasant wrought, “He nimbly springs from forth his grot, “Then both the distin'd journey take “By midnight gloom their jaunt to make: “And now about that time each mouse “Took refuge in a wealthy house, “Where gorgeous carpets crimson-red “Look'd splendid on each ivory bed: “Where many a bit, in many a tray, “Was left from feast of yesterday. “He having then the peasant set “Upon a purple coverlet, “Run like my landord here and there— “Dish after dish with dainty fare, “And like a handy footman serves, “First tasting every thing he carves. “The clown by no means making strange “Begins to chuckle at the change, “And lying on the couch at ease “Lives merrily on all he sees. “But on a sudden, with a roar, “Bang open flies the folding door, “And fright our gutlers from their cheer— “Now round the room half-dead with fear, “They scout—new terrors still abound, “With barking dogs the roofs resound. “Then (quoth the clown) I have no call “For such a life as this at all; “My cave and wood be still my share, “There rather let me skulk from care, “And live upon a single tare.” SATIRE VII. [Long while a list'ner, I wou'd speak] Horace introduces his slave, rating him soundly for living a different life from that which he had promised. Long while a list'ner, I wou'd speak, But somewhat dread my mind to break, As but a slave—What, is it you? Is't Davus?—Davus good and true: That is so far as to give hope There's no occasion for a rope.— Well, use the right the Roman sire Allows you by the winter fire, And since December's come about, Come let us fairly have it out. There is a portion of mankind Who're constantly to vice inclin'd, And let their faults take root and grow. Many there are that ebb and flow, One while a sideling to the right, One while to sin obnoxious quite, Priscus, observ'd at times to wear Three rings, at times his left-hand bare, Liv'd so irregular, his way Was still to shift ten times a day. Sometimes from a most sumptuous scene He'd seek a place so poor and mean, From whence a servant just made free Wou'd scarce appear with decency: One while a rake at Rome, one while A scholar in th'Athenian style, Born, when Vertumnus and his airs Prevail'd the most on man's affairs. When Volanerius got the gout His hands deserv'd his life throughout, The stay'd buffoon hir'd at a price A substitute to throw the dice: One, who to sin the more in chains Was much less wretched for his pains, Than he who plays at fast and loose, All abstinence, or all abuse.— Thou varlet canst thou ever shew To what this trash pertains?—To you— How scoundrel?—You are apt to praise The peace and forms of ancient days, To which shou'd any God reduce Your manners, you wou'd beg excuse; Because you have not that at heart Which you so clamorously assert, Or too irresolute and light To stand by what is just and right You hesitate with vain desire To get your foot from out the mire: In town you for the country sigh, But Rome's extoll'd up to the sky, When to your villa you're confin'd Such is your sickleness of mind, If uninvited by a friend, Your peace and sallad you commend, And hug yourself at home and bless That you shall share no man's excess, As if by force alone you stirr'd— But shou'd Mæcenas send you word Late as the lighting of the rooms. “Ho! quick, who brings me these perfumes? “What no one hear a man?”—you cry, As loud as you can bawl—and fly. Milvius and play'rs, that hop'd to stay, In wrath go supperless away, And leaving many a backward pray'r Too gross for your nice ears to bear. Some one may say, nor I deny, That I with appetite comply, Snuff up my nose at sav'ry food, Am weak and dull, and to conclude A sot—but seeing, sir, you are As bad as I am, and to spare, Why do you call me to account, As if your virtues did surmount, And veil the error of your ways, In all the art of specious phrase. But what, and if you shou'd be found More fool than him, that cost ten pound, Why then refrain each threatning look, The hand and wrath I cannot brook, While I into your ears relate The things I learnt at Crispin's gate. You with your robes all thrown aside, Your ring and your Equestrian pride, From a grave magistrate evade, As Dama in a masquerade, Still in suspence about your fate, Art not the thing you personate! And dreading danger for the nonce, Are trembling in your honour's bones. What differs it, once bound an oath For scourge, or broad-sword, or for both, Or shut within a filthy chest, Where of the lady's sins possess'd A maid has cramm'd you neck and heels! Does not the husband hold the seals, So far as a just power to claim Against both whoring rogue and dame! A juster with regard to you, For she nor changes place nor hue: Besides the woman acts in dread, Nor trusts a word of all you said. Yet to the yoke you needs must stoop, The raging husband's destin'd dupe; Life, body, fortune, soul and all In a most lamentable thrall, You have escap'd and will beware— No, no, you'll seek another snare Again to fear, again to die, O wav'rer for servility! What beast so fond as to obtrude Upon the snares it cou'd elude? Your'e no adulterer, you will say, Nor I a felon by my fay, When prudent I pass by the plate, But if from Tyburn you'll abate, Nature, when left unto herself, Will clear the closet and the shelf. Inferior then in deed and word Will you pretend to be my lord, Who punish'd twice and twice again, Will never from your sins refrain? Add we yet more to what we've said Of equal weight upon this head. Whether a man, whom slaves obey Be freeman, or a slave, as they, (For this sometimes is a dispute) Are you or I of most repute? For you, o'er me who domineer To others are in servile fear, And like a poppet wir'd and shown Have not a motion of your own; Who then is free of all mankind? One wise and master of his mind Whom neither want nor death nor bonds Can terrify—who corresponds With heav'n and virtue to defy All lust and fame beneath the sky; At once by gift and conduct too As finely turn'd, as polish'd true; So that no rub or outward force Retard him in his level course; 'Gainst when dame fortune is at fault, When'er she makes her worst assault! From all these attributes of fame Have you a single thing to claim? A woman of the town demands Five talents of your honour's hands, And after your'e turn'd out of bed Throws down cold water on your head. Anon she calls you—break the chain, And say, that “I am free again,” You are not able for that scourge And sov'reign of your soul will urge, And as he calls himself desire Will spur the more, the more you tire. When you, in folly so far gone, Admire a piece by Pausias drawn, Are you the less to blame than me, Who, when the prize-fighters I see, Stare at the men or brown'd and black't In coal or oaker—“'tis the fact, “The very thing, the martial strife “They strike and parry life and life.” Davus is idle, to be sure, And you a vet'ran connoisseur. I, if I smell when people bake, Am call'd to nothing for a cake, Does your great virtue, godlike soul, Resist the ven'son and the jole? My fondness for my paunch is wrong: Why so?—I rue it by the thong. But are you of all smarting clear, Who buy your things so plaguy dear; Then those titbits, which you repeat So oft, your palled stomach heat, And for your body you provide, Mis-judging feet your steps to guide. Shou'd any boy a A scrapter, or flesh-brush, that they used at the baths. strigil take By night, and pawn it for plumb-cake, Is he to blame? and are not you, Who sell your farms for dainties too? Besides, you never can command An hour yourself, nor understand How you your leisure shou'd amuse, And self to self wou'd fain excuse A vagabond from thought, who pine To banish care by sleep or wine, In vain—for sticking to your back He is your constant friend in black. —A stone where is there to be had? A dart?—How now, the man is mad, Or making verse—restrain your speech, Or quick you go to hedge and ditch. SATIRE VIII. [How far'd you at the miser's feast] Horace interrogates his friend Fundanius, concerning the supper of Nasidienus, at which he was present. How far'd you at the miser's feast, For there, from yester-noon at least, You plied the glass, as it was clear By one I sent to bid you here?— —So well our time we pass'd away, I never had a merrier day.— Say, if 'tis not against the law, What first appeas'd your rav'nous maw?— —First a Lucanian boar was brought, Which (as our host affirm'd) was caught, When the South gently blew—the dish Was garnish'd with both herbs and fish, Anchovies, lettuce, skirret too, Such as the appetite renew, With vinegar from Coan lees, Which all dispos'd of by degrees, One brisk lad wipes, with purple clout, The maple table round about; Another clears off all the rest, Irksome or useless to the guest. The moor Hydaspes makes parade, (As with grave rites th' Athenian maid) Bringing the Cæcuban along; Alcon comes in with Chian strong, To which no sea had damage done— Here our good host his speech begun: “Mæcenas, if you chuse to dine “With Alban or Falernian wine, “Rather than any thing you see, “Straight you may both command of me.”— O wretched wealth!—but, prithee show, Fundanius, for I burst to know, Who was there with you at this treat, Where all things were so grand and neat. Well, I was in the highest place With Viscus, and a little space Was Varius (as I think) below Vibidius too and Balatro, Which last Mæcenas brought to wait Merely as danglers on his state. Then Nomentatus took his post, Upon the right hand of our host, Porcius beneath—despis'd and hiss'd, For gorging pan-cakes at a twist. For this was Nomentanus bid, If ought was unobserv'd or hid, To point it out—as for the rest, I, and each undiscerning guest, We fish and fowl at random took, Nor saw th'invention of the cook, Which shortly I was giv'n to know, When he did on my plate bestow Some turbot-guts, and eels, and plaice, Such as no other table grace. Then, willing I shou'd learn, he said, That honey-apples look'd most red, Pluck'd when th'moon begins to wane; Our host himself will best explain How vast the odds—Vibidius here Thus whispers in his neighbour's ear— “Unless we tipple to his cost, “All hopes of vengeance will be lost; “Put more capacious tumblers on.”— On which our host grew wond'rous wan, As dreading nothing with such hate, As them that drink inordinate; Whether because they jest too free, Or swilling to extreme degree, They blunt the judgment of the taste— And now whole casks are drank in waste, Both by Vibidius and his friend, And strangers at the lower end: Mæcenas, and the guests select, To decency had more respect. A lamprey next was usher'd in, With floating prawns in a turrenne. This (says our host) was caught with spawn, As tasteless when the row is gone, For these a sauce of oil was dress'd, From choice Venufran berries press'd, With pickle from th'Iberian fry, Wine five years old—but by the bye Not made beyond sea—all these three, While it is stewing best agree, But when once stew'd the Chian wine, No better thing you can divine, With pepper white, and not without Such vinegar, as will turn out By souring Methymnean juice— “I was the first that brought in use, “With these the bitter herb to shred, “And first cut rockets from the bed; “Tho' 'twas Curtillus, I must say, “That to sea-urchins gave the day, “Which in their native salt excel “Ought you can get from any shell.” Mean time the tap'stry hung on high Fell down upon the company, Bringing black dust, a greater load Than winds on the Campanian road. We, frighten'd at the first alarm, Soon as we found 'twas no great harm, Return each person to his post— But with his head reclin'd our host Began to snivel in despair, As if he'd lost his son and heir. What must have been the end—unless Sage Nomentanus with address, Had undertook his friend to cheer. “O Fortune! which is more severe, “Of all the immortal powr's than thee, “With what an everlasting glee, “You love our projects to distress!” Here Varius, who cou'd not suppress His laugh, was forc'd the cloth to cram.— Servilius, ever apt to bam, Cries out with sanctity of face, “Such are the terms of human race, “Wherefore there's no degree of fame “Can answer your right noble aim, “That you shou'd torture and distract “Yourself, so anxiously exact, “That I shou'd be thus well receiv'd! “How, lest the rowls shou'd burn, you griev'd! “Or broth ill-season'd be serv'd up, “Or lads in waiting, while we sup, “Neglect the necessary care “Of neat apparel, well-comb'd hair, “Besides, your terror to inhance, “Lo! all these accidents of chance, “If hangings shou'd come down, as now, “Or footman taken from the plough, “Shou'd tumble with a dish upstairs— “But with a noble host it fares, “As with great captains in the field; “In thriving times their skill's conceal'd, “Which in adversity breaks out, “And brings stupendous things about.” Our Host to this—pray heav'n may grant, Both all you wish and all you want; Consid'ring that you are the best Of men, and most diverting guest— And for his sandals he applied In act to take a turn aside. Then round the table you might hear A gen'ral buzzing, mouth to ear I wou'd not choose a farce, or play, In preference to such a day.— —But let me have it in a word, What next to raise the laugh occurr'd?— Vibidius with the waiters spoke, Ask'd if the flaggon too was broke? Because to his incessant call, They ministred no wine at all. And while the laughter is immense, Kept up on many a false pretence, With Balatro to help us on— Re-enter host—no longer wan, As by an happy after-clap To remedy his dire mishap. Him follow servants, which sustain The sever'd members of a crane, In a large charger, sprinkled o'er With salt and flour, a plenteous store, A gander's liver next he brings, Fatted with figs, and jointed wings Of hare, as more the taste to suit Than if you eat the back to boot. Then over-roasted mearles appear, And ring-doves without rumps—fine cheer! Had not their dull loquacious lord Plac'd all their hist'ries on record, And on their natures lectures read, Whom we in indignation fled, Nor tasted of his dainty fare, As if Canidia had been there, And with her fetid breath had blown, In spite to Afric snakes unknown.

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME IV. Ex vitæ monstrata via est et gratia regum, Pieriis tentata modis. —Hor. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE EPISTLES OF HORACE. EPISTLE I. To Mæcenas. He affirms that he now throws matter of merriment aside, and adheres only to such things as conduce to virtue. O subject of my first essays! Whom as in duty bound to praise, My muse ev'n to the last persists, Again you force me to the lists, With freedom's A rod, or wand, given as a token of liberty, by the master of the fencing-school, to gladiators, on their dismission. rod dismiss'd the stage, As far too much expos'd in age. No more I have the thirst for fame, Nor is my time of day the same. Vejanius having fix'd his arms Now skreens him in the ground, he farms, That from the theatre no more, He may the mob for life implore. Something keeps whisp'ring in my ear, Which purg'd can in the spirit hear, Loose the old courser, if you're wise, Lest, if he enter for the prize, He may be scorn'd, as coming last, And fetch his broken wind too fast. Wherefore I now will throw away, All verse and toys of idle play, And all enquiry, thought, and care, But what is true, and what is fair, And hoard up maxims, and for use Arrange them, that I may deduce. And lest, perchance, you shou'd enquire, What school, what master, I admire, Know I'm addicted to no sect, Nor swear, as other men direct, But suit the tenor of my way, To the complexion of the day; Now active and officious grown, To state contentions am I prone, A guard and stedfast partizan Of virtue, and th'heroic man; With Aristippus now agree, Not I for things, but things for me. As tedious as the livelong night To him, whose mistress plays the bite, As tedious as the livelong day, To hirelings that must work for pay; As tedious as the livelong year, To minors under dames severe; So do all times and seasons go With me, intolerably slow, Which in the least retard the thought Of doing all things, as we ought, And making of that point secure, Which gain'd is well for rich and poor, But if neglected will destroy Alike the hope of man and boy. Add yet, that I myself controul, And with these dictates sooth my soul, Like One of the Argonauts, who had such piercing eyes, that it was said, he could see through a wall. Lynceus you cannot discern, Yet do not wholesome eye-salve spurn. And tho' you are not quite so stout As matchless Glycon, walk about, By exercise to foil the gout. We may begin at least and strive, Tho' to the goal we cannot drive. Does your breast glow inflam'd with vice By lust, or sordid avarice? Know, there are words and charming sounds, Whence one may sooth all mental wounds, May mitigate the pain at least, If not intirely calm your breast. Are you puff'd up with love of praise, Philosophers have wrote essays, Which thrice read o'er your heart will chear, If your attention be sincere. The envious, wrathful, slow of will, The wencher, toper, know no ill, But may be cur'd, if they'll apply The lectures of philosophy. 'Tis virtue first from vice to flee, And the first wisdom to be free From folly—are you not aware, With how much labour, how much care Of mind and body, 'tis your aim Want or rejection to disclaim, Things that you rate the greatest shame! A merchant to the farthest shore Of India, to be poor no more, And with assiduous toil you brave The rocks, the flames, the wind and wave: Will you not hear, and learn, and trust Those that are wiser, lest you lust, And any more those things admire, Which 'tis a folly to desire? Is there a fighter for a prize About the streets, that wou'd despise The honour of th'Olympic crown, Had he the hopes of such renown, And, that he take no pains at all, Was mention'd as conditional? Silver is less of price than gold, And gold than virtue, thousand fold. Yet, O ye cits! this is the cry, Let money be the first supply, And then be honest by and bye. This is at either Janus taught, And this cant ev'n our youths have got, This too can each old dotard charm, With bag and ledger on his arm. Polite, brave, eloquent, and true, If certain sesterces be due, Four hundred thousand to fulfil, You must be a plebeian still. And yet the very boys at play Cry, he shall be the king to-day Whoe'er behaves the best of all. This be thy fort and brazen wall, To have a conscience clear within, Nor colour at the change of sin. Say, is the Roscian edict best, Or does the ballad stand the test, Where the boys offer, as they sing, The crown to him who lives a king? Which manly Curius sung of yore, And brave Camillus long before; From him does better counsel come, Who bids you scramble up a sum. Right, if you can; but if your fate Deny, a sum at any rate, That you may have the foremost row, When Puppius plays his tragic woe? Or him who animates your fight, And wishes you may stand upright, With lib'ral soul to stem the tide Of fortune, with her frowns and pride? Now shou'd the Romans bid me say, Why I, who walk in the same way, Have not my sentiments the same, Nor follow as they praise or blame?— I make my answer in the stile Of crafty Reynard, all the while, Who thus unto the lion said, When he beheld him sick, “I dread “The footsteps all toward your throne, “But in the home-direction none!” Thou dost with many heads appear A monster, where must I adhere? Who's guide? with some it is a charm, The public revenues to farm, And some rich widows wou'd intice, With fruits and sweetmeats, all the price. And others wou'd old dotards get, Like fish decoy'd into their net. Many by secret us'ry thrive— But grant that all the men alive, With diff'rent talents are supplied, Can they a single hour abide, Approving their avow'd persuits? “No place in all the world disputes “The palm with Baiæ, sweet and gay.” This haply shou'd a rich man say, Anon the lake and sea must feel The hurry of his lordly zeal. But if caprice the hint approve— “To-morrow, masons, all remove “Your chissels and your iron crows, “And at Theanum's seat dispose.” Has he at home a genial bed? He will advance upon this head, The happier and the better fate Is his, who keeps the single state. But if he's single, he'll protest That married men alone are blest; What noose for Proteus shall I find, His many-changing form to bind? How fares the peasant?—there's the joke— He shifts and turns like other folk; Changes his loft, and bed of hair, Bath, barber—when he pays his fare, In his own barge the rich grandee Is not more nice and sick than he. Me, if with my hair all cut awry By some bad barber you espy, You laugh—and if beneath a coat That's neat, a ragged shirt you note, And if my gown but badly sit, Again you laugh to show your wit. What therefore, will you do with me Whose soul and self cannot agree? When now I spurn the thing I sought, Now sigh for what I set at nought, Disorder'd in th'unconstant tide Of things, that vary far and wide, Knock down, rebuild, turn square to round? You judge me but to be unsound, According to the gen'ral trim, And neither ridicule the whim, Nor think I want a doctor's aid, Nor keeper by the Prætor paid: Tho' you're the guard of my affairs, And liable to real cares, For a cut finger, if your friend's, Who loves you, and on you depends. In fine, the Stoics, only prove, The wise is less, if less, than Jove, Whom free, fam'd, king 'tis fair to call, And in his senses after all; Unless a sudden fit of spleen By some mishap shou'd intervene. EPISTLE II. To Lollius. He asserts that Homer, in his poems, shews what is good more fully and better than certain philosophers. He then exhorts to the cultivation of virtue. O pleader of the highest fame! Whilst in the Forum you declaim, I at Præneste re-peruse, The battles of th'Homeric muse, Who what is fair and what is base, Of use, or not in any case, Points fully, on a better plan, Than Crantor or Crysippus can. Whence this opinion I will shew, Unless you've something else to do. The argument (in which we read, For Paris his adulterous deed, Long war the wasted Grecians wag'd And with barbarians were engag'd) The broils of a mad people sings, And their infatuated kings; Antenor's council wou'd propose, By fair amends, the war to close; But Paris will not yield to this, Jealous of safety, as of bliss. Nestor wou'd fain make up th'affair 'Twixt Peleus' son and Atreus' heir. One burns with love, and both with ire: Mean time how great soe'er the fire That's kindled by each foolish chief, The people feel the loss and grief. By faction, fraud, by lust, and sin, By wrath without the walls, and in, Much is the mischief, and the din. Again, and in another tale, How prudence and a heart avail, He has with exemplary art Explain'd in sage Ulysses' part, Who politic from Troy's defeat Made many cities with his fleet, And got an insight in their ways, And while on the great sea he strays, Returning with himself and crew, Had many hardships to go thro'. And yet cross fate's severest frown Cou'd ne'er prevail to sink him down. The Siren's charms and Circe's cup You know, which if he'd guzzled up, As did with glee each foolish mate, Base in a most disastrous state, The slave of an imperious queen He must a filthy cur have been, And had the form and gross desire Of Swines rejoicing in the mire. We, all mere cyphers from our birth, Consume the product of the earth; Ev'n like Penelope's leud knaves, Or whom Alcinous made slaves; A youth for their complexion born, Who us'd to sleep the livelong morn, And so to doze away their cares, Sooth'd by the harps composing airs. Robbers get up and kill for pelf— Will you not rise to save yourself? Which if you shall not do in health The dropsy will come on by stealth: And if you do not call away For book and light before the day, And keep not all your thoughts intent On studies and designs well-meant, With love or envy, when awake, Your tortur'd heart shall surely ache. For why do you hasten to remove Things, that your eyes cannot approve, Yet if ought make the soul impure, You for a year differ the cure. One half is done if you set out, Dare to be wise, nor longer doubt. Whoe'er delays him to be good, Stands like the clown upon the flood, Expecting till the stream had done, But that still perseveres to run, And in eternal motion strong Shall pass voluminous along. Apt for the purposes of life, And for to bear your heirs, a wife Is sought—the woodland wild is fell'd, That there th'improving plough be held. Yet he that has enough in store Ought by no means to sigh for more. Nor house, nor farm, nor brass nor gold, From his sick body can withold The raging fever of their lord, Or care's unseen attacks award. The rich possessor must have health, Or there's no joy in hoarded wealth. He, on whom lust or terror wait Enjoys his seat and his estate, As pictures for the blind are meet, And poultices for gouty feet, Or all the harping of the spheres, To those that have obstructed ears. Unless the vessel is sweet, you pour The wine therein, to make it sour: Despise all pleasures light and vain, For pleasure's noxious bought with pain: The churl a beggar is and seems, Then set due limits to your schemes: A pining takes th'invidious sneak, When'er he sees his neighbour sleek. Sicilian tyrants ne'er cou'd find A torture like an envious mind. The man whose passion is not curb'd Will wish, what in a mind disturb'd He did, was totally undone, As too great lengths his malice run. Wrath is short madness, that restrain At once, by bridle and by chain, Or what shou'd serve, will always reign. The groom is wont the colt to check, While teachable with pliant neck, To go the road the riders please. The puppy from the time he sees The buckskin in the hall, and barks, Adventures in the woods and parks. Now, child, my words in your pure breast Imbibe; now offer for the best. That cask the scent will long retain, Which it receiv'd, when new, in grain; But if you loiter in the race, Or urge too much the rapid pace, I wait not for the slow and speed, Nor push on them that take the lead. N. B. All these precepts are drawn from examples in Homer; a thing (I believe) not understood by any other editor of Horace. Otherwise, there would not have been such a complaint of a want of connection, between the former and the latter part of this Epistle. EPISTLE III. To Julius Florus. He interrogates him concerning Claudius Nero, and of the writings of certain of his friends. He then exhorts Florus himself to the study of wisdom, and to be reconciled to his brother. Fain, Florus, would I understand, Where Claudius now has got command, Ev'n Cæsar's gallant son-in-law. Does Thrace, or snows, that never thaw In Hebrus, now detain your pow'rs, Or seas that run between the tow'rs, Or in those Asiatic plains And hills, where such abundance reigns, Are you compell'd to take your rout? What are the courtly wits about? For this I'm anxious too to ask— Who dares to undertake the task Great Cæsar's history to write, And eternize each glorious sight, And happy peace?—Is Titius there? For whom all Rome their praise prepare; Who fills his cup devoid of dread At the Pindaric fountain-head, Lakes, streams, and all the rural scene Disdaining, as for him too mean. Is he in perfect health, and kind Enough to bear me in his mind? Does he the Theban lays aspire To render on the Roman lyre, Or rants he with the Muse, his guide, In all the tragic pomp and pride? On Celsus does my council gain, So often urg'd, and urg'd in vain, To strike out matter of his own And by all means to let alone Such books as have arrang'd themselves On Palantine Apollo's shelves: Lest if the feather'd flock come there, And each demand his proper share, The vain jack-daw shou'd cause a roar, Strip'd of the borrow'd plumes he wore; What heights do you attempt to climb, And active on the flowery thyme, Whence balmy sweetness do you cull? For far from mean, and far from dull Your cultivated genius tow'rs: Whether in keen rhetoric pow'rs You at the bar attention draw, Or answer in the civil law, Or in sweet verse you build renown, And conquer for the ivy crown. Now cou'd you find it in your heart, From care's cold comforts to depart, Then you divinely shou'd proceed Where'er philosophy wou'd lead. This work, this way shou'd be embrac'd By great and small, with eager haste, If we wou'd pass our season here Or to ourselves, or country dear. Of this too you must write me word, Whether Munatius is preferr'd To such degree of your esteem As I most necessary deem, Or, if the wound ill set to rights, For little purpose re-unites, And is at point to gape again— Now whether madness of the brain, Or ignorance of things disturb Your minds, like colts no skill can curb, Where'er you live, it is most true No brothers ought to love like you. However by these presents learn, I feed with tenderest concern, A votive runt for your return. EPISTLE IV. To Albius Tibullus. He addresses Albius Tibullus, to whom he seems to commend the study of Philosophy, and recount the talents with which he was adorned from heaven. Tibullus, whom I love and praise, Mild judge of my prosaic lays, Can I account for your odd turn, Who in Pedanian groves sojourn: Are you now writing to out-please The works of Cassius, or at ease, And silence, range the healthy wood, Studious of all things wise and good? Thou 'rt not a form without a heart, For heav'n was gracious to impart A goodly person, fine estate, Made for fruition, fortunate. What more for her most fav'rite boy, Cou'd a nurse image, to enjoy, Than to be wise, and ably taught, To speak aloud his noble thought, To whom grace, fame, and body sound, Might to pre-eminence abound, With table of ingenious fare, And purse with money still to spare? —'Twixt hope and care, 'twixt fear and strife, Think every day the last of life. Beyond your wish some happy day, Shall come your grief to over-pay. Me sleek and fat, as fat can be, I hope you'll shortly come to see: When you've a mind to laugh indeed At pigs of the Lucretian breed. EPISTLE V. To Torquatus. He invites him to a supper, which he assures him shall be a frugal one. If, as a guest, you think it meet To sit on an old-fashion'd seat, And on a mod'rate dish to sup, Where herbs make all the banquet up, At home I'll tarry for my friend Just as the ev'ning rays descend. Wine you shall drink in casks prepar'd When Taurus was again declar'd; Betwixt Minturnian fens 'twas press'd, And where Petrinum's vines are dress'd, But, if you've better, send for me, Or else with these commands agree: Bright shines my hearth, and, to be seen By you, my furniture is clean. From airy hopes and Moschus' cause, And broils concerning riches pause: The festal time of Cæsar's birth Shall give to-morrow peace and mirth; It shall be lawful to prolong The summer night in social song. What's Fortune, if I must forbear To use it?—he that lives to spare For his successor, self-severe, Is raving mad, or very near. I will begin to booze and straw Sweet flow'rs, by no means kept in awe, Tho' held a rake-shame for my pains— How drinking whets th'inventive brains, Discloses secrets, strengthens hope, Makes dastards with the valiant cope, The burthen lifts from anxious hearts, Adapts a man to learn the arts! Whose eloquence is not sublime, That takes off bumpers at a time? And who so poor and who so bare, But in his cups is free from care? These 'tis my duty to provide, Both with propriety and pride, And willingly I shall attend, Lest dirty counterpanes offend, That no foul napkin discompose, To wrinkles, your discerning nose; And that the cup and dish, we place, Shall shine until you see your face, That there be none to hear and spread, What amongst faithful friends is said. And that hale fellows be well met, Brutus shall come to join the set, Septimius and Sabinus too. Unless h'as better cheer in view, And prettier maids. There is to boot Room for such danglers, as shall suit. But guests you know, too great a throng, Are apt, like goats, to smell too strong. Write back what number you wou'd be, And from all other business free, Tho' clients in your court-yard wait, Deceive them at the postern gate. EPISTLE VI. To Numicius. To hold nothing in too high admiration, is a thing which he asserts to be almost solely effectual for the happiness of life. Of nothing to be over-fond, Numicius, is contentment's bond; This makes and keeps the bed of rest— There are, who with unanxious breast, Can view the sun, and starry pole, And seasons, which by periods roll. What think you of earth's golden mine, And wealth, on either side the line, With which the wafting ocean stores The Arabs, and the Indian shores? Then as for plays, and shows of state, The people's favours to the great, In what light are they to be view'd, And what from thence must sense conclude? Who dreads the contrary of these, Not so the wond'ring fondness flees, Stupidity o'er each prevails, If fortune lift, or load the scales: Rejoice, or grieve, desire, or fear, What matters it?—shou'd things appear Or better far, or worse than hope, If man and mind become a mope, Let Wise-men bear the name of fools, The jest of those, that break all rules; If Virtue's self they shall pursue, Beyond the laws, and limits due. Look now on plate with wond'ring eye, For ancient busts, and bronzes sigh! To all politer arts aspire, And gems and Tyrian dies admire; Rejoice that when you make harrangue, On thee ten thousand gazers hang, Seek to the bar by morning light, And come not home till late at night, Lest Mucius from his lady's dow'r, Shou'd reap more corn than in your pow'r, Still holding it in highest scorn, That he of meaner parents born, Shou'd rather show himself than you, More admirable of the two. Whatever up in earth they lay, Time shall expose to open day, And things shall bury deep, and hide, What now shine in the greatest pride. Tho' in the Appian way you go, And still yourself with grandeur show, Beneath Agrippa's Portico; Yet thither must your course be bent, Where Numa, and where Ancus went. If any virulent disease; Your reins, or either side shou'd seize, Seek remedy—wou'd you excel In life, as who wou'd not do well; If worth alone can this atchieve; For virtue then your pleasures leave. Virtue, perhaps, is understood As made of words, like trees, of wood. If so, then make the port with speed, See, no one your own ship precede, Lest you perchance shou'd lose the fair, And selling of your foreign ware: At once a thousand talents sweep, An equal sum to crown the heap, A third to widen the amount, A fourth to square the whole account; For money, monarch of this life, Gains you a portion with your wife, Gives credit, friends—will heralds buy, To blaze you of a family, Gives beauty and when wealth is great, There Venus and Suadela wait. The Cappadocian king, they say, Has slaves, but has no cash to pay; Not so your own affairs dispose— This fellow, probably, had the cloathing of a legion.Lucullus, as the story goes, Ask'd by some persons on the stage, If he could possibly engage, An hundred cloaks at once to lend.— Cried, how can I so many send? But I will look amongst my ware, And furnish what there is to spare. Anon, he writes them word, to call For full five thousand, part, or all. 'Tis a mean house, that has not got Redundant wealth, which profits not The rich possessor, but deceives, And is the bait, and gain of thieves. Wherefore, if wealth alone increase, Means and duration for our peace, Be first this business to atchieve, And be the last of all to leave: Besides, if fortune's minions are, The splendid and the popular, Then some shrewd servant let us buy, The names of voters to supply, Jog our left-side, and give a tread Upon our toes, the hands to spread, In token of our profer'd grace, Spite of all obstacle and place. “This man has interest to bribe “The Fabian, or the Veline tribe, “That bustler gives the consulate, “Or takes away the chair of state.” Then with appellatives endear With father, brother, in their ear, According to their sev'ral age, Adopt them to your patronage. If he lives happiest, who feeds The daintiest, where the gullet leads Let us set out at early day To fish, to hunt, as was the way Gargilius chose not long ago, Who nets, poles, servants, for a show Made thro' the thickest croud to pass, That one boar thrown a cross an ass, Might to the populace appear When taken with the silver spear. Let us with loaded stomachs swim, Confounding decency and whim, As lawless as Ulysses' crew, Who were determined to pursue All vice and pleasures contraband, Rather than make their native land. If with Mimnermus you agree, That there is no felicity But what is found in love and jest, Then rake and rally with the best.— Health and long life, my friend, await! Be candid—and communicate, If better rules of life you've got, But practise these with me, if not. EPISTLE VII. To Mæcenas. He excuses himself to Mæcenas, that he did not stand to his word, and commemorates and extols his patron's liberality towards him; but asserts that liberty and peace of mind ought to be preferred to the benefactions of our friends, and all manner of riches. False to the promise that I made, Here for all August have I stay'd, Altho' my honour was at stake In five days my return to make. But if, Mæcenas, you regard The health and spirits of your bard, The kind indulgence, which you show To me, when sick; you will bestow When I'm in fear of being so. While early figs and sultry heat Make fun'rals blacken all the street, While parents tremble for their boys, And all the business and the noise Of canvassing, and law appeals Bring illness, which the will unseals. But if on Alban fields the snows Shou'd come, away your poet goes Down to the sea his brains to spare, And read in snug composure there. Him, my dear friend, you shall receive, If you will deign to give him leave, When the warm sky the Zephyrs clear With the first swallow of the year. You've give me opulence to boast, But not like the Calabrian host, Who presses you his pears to eat, “I do it, friend—enough's a treat” —But fill your pockets, if you chuse— “Good sir, your bounty's too profuse”— By doing so you'll bear away Fit presents for your boys at play— “The offer has as much bestow'd, “As if I bore away a load”— Do as you please, but, by the bye, You leave them only for the stye. The fool's blunt bounty on this plan Procures no thank, nor ever can. The wise and good themselves profess, Ready for merit in distress, But know, not easy to be bit, The medal from the counterfeit. I also will present a heart Of worth to act a thankful part, But if attach'd, as heretofore, You'd have me, sir, you must restore My constitution strong and hale, And those black locks that grew to veil My narrow forehead, and renew My pleasantry in converse too: You must revive my easy smiles, And jeopardy for Cynara's wiles, As maudlin I was want to cry That jilts their faithful swains shou'd fly. A female fox, exceeding thin, Seeing a narrow pass crept in, As leading to a tub of meal— There having eat a wondrous deal, She strove to make her way in vain With her big belly, out again: To whom a weasel not far off, Cried out in most sarsastic scoff, If you wou'd fairly make escape, Resume the fineness of your shape. If in particular with me This cited image shou'd agree, I give up all, nor do I praise The pleasure of the rural ways, From rank repletion of the town, Nor yet shall eastern wealth go down, Nam'd with the liberty and ease, Of where I will and what I please. You often have commended me For diffidence and modesty; And in return have had your due, “My sov'reign and my father too” Behind your back my speech affirms Your merit in the self-same terms; Judge then, if I without regret Cou'd give up all again, as yet. Telemachus, the genuine heir Of all his Father's patient care, Well answer'd in a certain case— “Our Ithaca is not a place “For horses, where no plains abound “Of much extent, nor grass is found: “Atrides, I those gifts resign “Which suit your country more than mine.” The little folk shou'd not presume, But choose small things—imperial Rome No longer can have pow'r to please Like Tibur's peace, Tarentum's ease. Brave, active, of the highest fame For pleading, as Philippus came Near the eight hour from forth the bar; Complaining ship-street was too far For him at such a time of day, Beheld a person, as they say; Just from the barber shaven clean, Paring his nails with easy mien, “Demetrius (speaking to his slave” Quite apt, when his commands he gave) “Go make enquiry and bring word, “Where this man lives and how preferr'd, “Whose son, to whom he pays his court?” The lad returns and makes report— “He's a poor man, Mena's his name, “By trade a cryer, free from blame, “One that can bustle, or unbend “His mind, and free to get or spend; “For chronies make up his delight, “Besides a certain home at night, “At even, when he's done his trade, “Is at the play or the parade.” I wou'd that he himself explain The things you mention, go again, And bid him come to sup at eve— Poor Mena scarcely cou'd believe, With silent wonder, and in short Made answer in a civil sort. “What does the scrub deny—'tis clear “He is indifferent or in fear”— Next day as he was at his job Of selling trump'ry to the mob, Philippus takes him unawares And first salutes him—he prepares For business his excuse to beg, Tyed, as he sees him, by the leg, Or he that morning had address'd, And been before hand with his guest. “Think that I make the matter up “If you to-night will come and sup.” —Content—“then after nine arrive— “Go now and may your business thrive”— When supper came discourse they had Of sundry matters good and bad, At length he's suffer'd to withdraw. This gudgeon when he often saw Advancing to the cover'd hook, Untill the bait unseen he took, A client by the morning's light, A never-failing guest at night, He is commanded to attend Unto his seat his noble friend, Just at the Latin festivals; Mounted on horse-back he extols The Sabine air and pleasant ways Thro' fields, nor ceases in his praise— Philippus laughs, and while he seeks Fit objects for his fun and freaks, And while he gives him to possess Sev'n thousand sesterces—no less— And promises by way of loan Sev'n thousand more, besides his own, He urges him a farm to buy— He buys one—(not to be too dry And tedious with this story) know He turns a rustic from a beau, And all his conversation now Is of the vineyard or the plough, Fatigues himself to death with care, And like an old man lives to spare. But when his sheep he lost by theft, By murrain of his goats bereft, His acres to no purpose till'd, His oxen with hard labour kill'd, Vex'd with his loss he takes his steed, And ev'n at midnight hies with speed, And in a passion makes his way To Philip's house before the day; Whom soon as Philip chanc'd to see, Rough and untrim'd to that degree, (Says he) my Mena, you appear By much too harsh and too severe— “O Patron! Mena then rejoin'd “If I in truth must be defin'd, “Wretch is my title to be sure— “And by thy genius, I conjure, “By your right hand and Gods, I pray, “Restore me to my former way”— As soon as any man perceives That he the better option leaves, Let him return before too late Unto his abdicated state. 'Tis just each person shou'd be clear, What is the compass of his sphere. EPISTLE VIII. To Celsus Albinovanus. Writing to Celsus he wou'd have him admonished by the Muse to bear his good fortune with moderation and decency. To Celsus, Muse, that I address, Wish thou all joy and good success, Who now with Nero has found grace, And got his secretary's place. Shou'd he enquire about my state, These, and the subsequent lines, are all ironical, and a dry rub upon Celsus, and particularly justify those lines of Persius, viz. Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico Tangit, et admissus circum præcordia ludit.Tell him my threats are fair and great; But for performance on my plan Am not a good nor happy man— Not that the hail my vines has marr'd, Or frosts destroy'd my olive-yard, Nor dies my heifer, or my goat With murrain out in fields remote, But that diseas'd with more defect Of mind, than body, I object To hear or learn things for my ease, And faithful doctors salves displease; I'm angry with the friends that strive To make this drowsy corpse alive; I seek the hurtful, good things fly, At Rome I still for Tibur sigh, At Tibur sickle, as the wind, I for the city am inclin'd. Next mind to ask him, how he wears, How goes himself and his affairs: How with the noble youth he stands, And with the cohort, he commands: Give him much joy, if all be well, Then in his ear this precept tell— “Bear thou good luck with meekness due; “And so your friends shall bear with you.” EPISTLE IX. To Claudius Nero. He recommends Septimius to him, and requests that he wou'd receive into a place in his friendship. Septimius, sure, of all mankind Best knows what grace with you I find; For when he prays in such a way, As to compel me to obey, That I in such a point of view Wou'd place him as to come to you, One worthy to be lov'd and hous'd, By him, who merit has espous'd, When he supposes that my fate Is nearer to your intimate Than I can possibly descry, He knows my secrets more than I. Much did I urge to be excus'd, But was in a degree confus'd, Lest I shou'd seem to act a part, And to dissemble in my heart, Pretending that my pow'r was none Quite bent on serving number one. Thus to avoid a worse offence I fly to town-bred confidence. But if assurance in the cause Of friendship merit your applause, The bearer in your list enroll, A brave good fellow and a soul. EPISTLE X. To Fuscus Aristius. He extols a country life, with which he is captivated, to Fuscus, a lover of the town. I, that the country best approve, To Fuscus, recommend my love; Who places in the town his bliss, At wond'rous odds, alone in this, We in all other things agree, As loving-like, as twins can be. With spirits of fraternal kind, Each is, or pleas'd, or disinclin'd, Each nods to each, in constant mood, Like two old pidgeons of the wood— You keep the nest—but Horace roves To streams and moss-grown rocks and groves. Do you ask why?—I live and reign, Er'e since I treated with disdain Those very scenes, which with such cries, You're all extolling to the skies; And like the slave, that flies the priest, As sick of a perpetual feast; I want the bread the country bakes Much rather than your honey'd cakes. Agreeably to nature's call If we must live, then first of all, You shou'd select a pleasant spot, Where you may build your little cot; And can you know a better place, Than that which rural beauties grace? Are warmer summers found elsewhere, Or is there any milder air To which a man may have recourse, What time the Dog-star is in force, Or when the Lion, in his turn, Does by the Sun's intenseness burn? Is there a place, where envious spleen, Breaks less upon your sleep serene? Say, do the Lybian stones excel The grass in sightliness or smell; Or does your water, while it strives To burst the pipes e'er it arrives, Run purer in the street, than those, Whose rapid current murmuring flows? Nay, wood is rais'd to please the eyes, Where variegated pillars rise, And for applause those buildings stand, Which have a prospect of the land. Expel dame nature, how you will, She must herself recover still, Breaking thro' fashion by degrees And vain caprice with her decrees. He that has not discerning sense, To see how far in excellence, The tinctures of Aquinum vie, With purple of Sidonian die, More loss can never undergo Than those, who have not wit to know The truth from that which is not so. Whom wealth and power too joyful make At a reverse of things will quake; Of ought if you are over-fond, On resignation you'll despond: One in a cot, for bliss indeed, Kings and their fav'rites may exceed: The stag, more warlike than the steed, Expell'd him from the common mead, Till long time worsted in the end He call'd on man to stand his friend, And took the bit—but when he came Stern conq'ror from the field of fame; He cou'd not of the rider quit His back, nor mouth from out the bit. Thus he that fears he shall be poor, Must loss of liberty endure, More precious far than gold, must bear A master, and such fetters wear As shall eternally enthrall, Because his income is too small. A man's concerns that will not do, May be resembled to a shoe, Which made too large will soon subvert Your feet, and if too small will hurt. If you're contented with good cheer, My Fuscus, then your wisdom's clear, And me your old ally chastise, Appearing busy in your eyes, To gather more than shou'd suffice. That money, which we scrape and crave, To all's a tyrant, or a slave, And yet 'tis easy to decide, It shou'd be guided, and not guide. These lines I wrote in idle vein, Behind Vacuna's mould'ring fane, Happy in every point of view, Except the joy to be with you. EPISTLE XI. To Bullatius returned from Asia. He asserts that it is of no consequence to the happiness of life, in what place any man dwells, since this depends upon peace of mind. Bullatius, how does Chios seem, And Lesbos of such high esteem? How Samos, that is built so neat, And Sardis, Crœsus' royal seat: Is Colophon, or Smyrna's fort, Nobler or meaner than report? Or are they each a paltry scene To Tibur, and his meadows green? Wou'd it your utmost wishes crown, To have some rich Attalic town, Or do you Lebedus admire, While land and sea the trav'ler tire, Tho' Lebedus be more obscure Than Gabii, or Fidenæ, sure; Yet cou'd I live in such a spot, Forgetting all, of all forgot, Rather than not command the sea To bluster far enough from me— But they, that come from Capua here, Whom rain, and muck, and dirt besmear, Wou'd not keep always in a hold; Nor when a man contracts a cold, The stoves and bagnios will he praise, So as to love them all his days. Nor tho' the Southern tempests reign, Wou'd that the merchant-man constrain To sell his ship, across the main. With one that's well, and wise to boot, Rhodes and fair Mitylene will suit, As a thick cloak, when summer glows, Or linnen draw'rs in piercing snows, Or Tiber, when the winter roars, Or in Mid-August grates and blow'rs. While yet you may, and fortune's smile Attends you, in th'applauding stile The praise of absent Rhodes resume, Of Samos, Chios, here at Rome. Whatever pros'prous hour below, The hands of providence bestow, Let gratitude confirm your own, Nor for the livelong year postpone, To use such things as best can please, That you may say, I've liv'd at ease, Whatever region you possess: For if right reason and address, And not a place that over-bears Wide ocean, can remove our cares, They change their climate, not their soul, Who go in ships from pole to pole. In strenuous idleness we strive, We launch our ships, and chariots drive In order for a happy lot; But that you seek is on the spot, And ev'n at A paltry forlorn place in Cambania. Ulubræ might be, For men of equanimity. EPISTLE XII. To Iccius. That he is rich alone, who makes good use of his finances. He writes also of the present state of the Roman affairs. If, as you take Agrippa's dues, Sicilian wealth you rightly use, A greater affluence, my friend, From Jove himself cou'd not descend. Cease murm'ring, for you cannot plead You're poor, and have the things you need, If well with belly, and with back, And for your feet you nothing lack, I do not see to make you glad, How ev'n imperial wealth wou'd add. If midst such plenty and such sums You starve, on herbs and miller's thumbs, So very near you'll skin the flint, That you will raise at least a mint, And fortune shortly shalt behold, A pow'ring in a flood of gold, Because, mere money, it is plain, Can ne'er avail to change the grain, Or that it is your thought and tone, That all things yield to worth alone. What wonder, if his neighbours cows, Upon his fields and meadows brouze, If the old sophist's active mind Be wandring from the man disjoin'd; When you a scrambler, and a sneak, Will after nothing trivial seek, But still to things exalted strain, As how the shores the floods contain, What rules the year, if on the pole The stars self-mov'd, or guided roll, What cause the Lunar orb benights, And what again her beauty lights, What is the pow'r, and what th'intent Of all this dissonant consent? Who most with reason disagrees, Stertinius, or Empedocles? But whether butchering of a rough, Or leeks and chives, your plate you stuff, Use Grosphus as a friend, and give With freedom what he will receive: I'll warrant Grosphus, that his pray'r Shall only be for what is fair. One vast benevolence may reap, When good men want, true friends are cheap. Now that you may not be in doubt, How our affairs at Rome turn out, The Spanish and Armenian bands, By Nero and Agrippa's hands, Are fall'n—Phraates on his knee, Does to great Cæsar's terms agree; And golden plenty all around Full-horn'd, th'Italian crops has crown'd. EPISTLE XIII. To Vinnius Asella. He requires of Vinnius that in presenting his books to Augustus he wou'd have a due respect to the timing and decency of doing it. Just as the whole direction stands, By frequent and by full commands, Upon your setting out reveal'd, Deliver up these volumes seal'd, To Cæsar—that is—shou'd you find, He's well, in spirits and inclin'd To ask for trifles of this kind. Lest zealous for my works and me You shou'd be thought to make too free, And bring an odium, if you press With ill-advis'd officiousness. But if my budget gall your back, Rather demolish all the pack, Than on the pavement rudely throw Before Augustus, when you go, To bring a jest in the event, Upon your Asinine descent, And be the talk of all the town— Use your best efforts up and down, Through sloughs and rivers, dale and hill, And when your purpose you fulfil, Thus bear the parcel, lest, perchance, You with my volume shou'd advance As country boobies hug a lamb, Or Pyrrhia, after many a dram, Stol'n yarn, or routed from his nap, The drunken cit his fudling-cap. Lest by a blunder you shou'd say, How much you sweated all the way In bringing verse, which may succeed To make great Cæsar hear and read. Intreated by the poet's pray'r, Proceed—good-bye—be well aware, Lest you shou'd stumble with your load, And break my orders on the road. EPISTLE XIV. To his Steward in the Country. He reprehends his Steward's desire to live in the city, and in the mean time capriciously despising the country, which aforetime he secretly longed for. O steward! of my small estate, Whose woods and fields new life create In me, tho' scorn'd by you thro' pride, Where five good families reside; And which in days of old sent down Five Senators to Baria's town: Let's try, if I the best succeed, In plucking up each thorn and weed, That in the inward man is found, Or you in clearing of the ground; And which the least offence has got, Or Horace, or his Sabine spot? Albeit the piety and woe Of Lamia, which no bounds will know, For his lost brother still severe, Detain me for a season here; Yet all my heart, and all my mind, Are solely thither-wards inclin'd, And fondly longs to break abrupt, On all barriers that interrupt. I say the country-life is best; You for the citizen contest; They with their own are in disgust, Who for another's portion lust, And each of us all sense disclaims, Who either place unjustly blames; The mind's in fault, which cannot shape It's flight from it's own self to 'scape. When you was drudge, for country air You sigh'd with many a secret pray'r; But now you're to a steward rais'd, The town, the stews, and baths, are prais'd: I have a more consistent heart, And always pensively depart, Whenever back to Rome my fate Drags me to business that I hate. From different bents we disagree, For what appears to such as thee, All horrid scenes, and desart waste, Are pleasant to a man of taste, Who thinks with me, and must despise Things that are charming in your eyes. The greasy taverns, and the stews, I know, make you the city chuse. Besides, I rear within my fence, The pepper, and the frankinsence; Nor yield my rocks the grape so quick, Nor have you there a tavern tick, Nor minstrel harlot, to whose sound You gambol cumb'rous to the ground. And yet you plough with might and main The fallows, that too long have lain, And finely tend the unyok'd beeves And fill them with fresh gather'd leaves; Besides the brook, in case of wet, Adds to an idle fellow's sweat, Best taught by embankations there, The sunny meadow land to spare. Come now attend, and you shall know The reason why we differ so; He who well-dress'd in essenc'd hair, Cou'd scot-free please the venal fair, He who from jovial noon to night, Cou'd quaff Falernian with delight, Now loves short meals, and sweet repose, Where springs green grass, and riv'let flows; Nor is it at one time of day, So much a shame to have been gay, As not to know one's hand to stay. There's no one with an evil glance, On my possessions looks askance, Nor poisons there with secret spite, Or slander's more audacious bite. The neighbours smile to see me toil, Clearing the clods and stone the soil— You'd rather munch upon the fare, Your fellow-slaves each day prepare, There are your wishes and your joy— Mean time the cunning errant-boy Grudges the fewel and the flocks, And what the kitchen-garden stocks. The ox wants trappings on his back, The plough wou'd suit the lazy hack; But I determine in that case, That each shall keep his proper place. EPISTLE XV. To Vala. Upon an engagement with himself to go to Velia and Salernum, he makes enquiry how it is to winter with them, and into the temperature of the air. At Velia—how's the winter there, And what's Salernum for its air? What set of men are there bestow'd? Is there a tolerable road? For Antonius Musa, a physician, celebrated at Rome, and all over Italy, for his curing Augustus, in the year of Rome 731, of a grievous disease, by making him bath and drink the waters; for which event, he received a large sum of money both from Cæsar and the Senate, with the privilege of the gold ring, which he had not before on account of his being only a free'd-man. Musa warrants on his fee, That Baiæ is no place for me, Yet makes me odious at the wells, While his prescription me compels To use cold water every day, Before the ice is gone away. In truth, the village justly sighs, To see us myrtle groves despise, And likewise that chalybeate stream, Held in such eminent esteem, As men of chronic ills it rids; And grudges at those invalids, Who dare their breast and head commit To Clusian waters, and think fit To go to Gabii, and those parts, Where with the cold a traveller smarts. The wonted place I now must change, And Inns accustom'd for the strange. The horses must be driven by— Hollo! quoth Bald-Face, where do you hie? Why not to Cumæ, nor to stay At Baiæ, will the rider say, And pull in wrath the left-hand rein; But angry speeches are in vain, For horses are not apt to fear Rough words, but in the bit they hear. Your letter too must let me know, At which place rankest harvests grow; Whether rain-water there they save, Or in perennial fountains lave. For how they there are serv'd with wine, At present, is no care of mine. When at my seat the bowl I crown, I can make any thing go down; But when I came upon the coast, The rich and mellow suit me most, Which may all anxious thoughts subdue, And raising up each pleasing view, Flow in my veins and spirit too. Which may a choice of words suggest, In which my youth may be exprest, And urg'd to the Lucanian Fair.— Next mention if the country there Abound with hares, or nurture boars, And write what shallows near the shores Most fishes, and sea-urchins breed, That I with you so well may feed, As to do credit to the place, And part with a A rich luxurious people. Phæacian face. To all these queries you, my friend, Must speak, and Horace shall attend. Mænius, who manfully had spent His father's, and his mother's rent, Begun upon the comic plan, And vague from post to pillar ran. He with a citizen wou'd deal As with a foe, denied a meal: Made up of most inveterate lies, Who ought on any wou'd devise; The dearth, and hurricane, and draught Of markets, whatsoe'er he caught He greedily bestow'd within, And when with winkers at his sin, And those poor souls he fill'd with dread, He little, or ev'n nothing sped, Whole harslets at a time he'd cram, With all th'intestines of a lamb, Devouring as his proper share, What wou'd have sated many a bear, Now being frugal, as it were: So as to urge; that men shou'd brand The guts of Epicurus' band. Yet this same Mænius, when he turn'd Some special booty that he earn'd, All into ashes, and to smoke, Then wou'd he Hercules invoke, And swear he cou'd not think it strange, That men shou'd eat both house and grange, While they fat thrushes cou'd prepare, And feast upon a banging bear. In fact, ev'n such a one am I, And when I cannot beg, or buy, Am very stout 'mongst sorry fare, But midst the viands nice and rare: I have another thing to say, That happiest of all men are they, Who by neat villas make it clear, They're worth some thousand pounds a year. EPISTLE XVI. To Quintius. After he has described the shape and situation of his Sabine farm, and mentioned his happiness in living there, he enquires into the life of his friend, and warns him not to depend upon vulgar report, but that he should prefer the reality, rather than the character of a good man. Lest you shou'd with yourself debate, Best friend, concerning my estate; Whether it feeds it's lord with corn, Or olive-yards the spot adorn, Or rich with fruit and meads it shines, Or elms, that are array'd with vines; To you I will diffusely write Of its dimensions, shape, and site. A chain of mountains wou'd appear, Did not a valley interfere, Which wou'd be darken'd by the shade, Did not the morning sun invade, Where on the right-hand side 'tis cleft, And beams at eve upon the left: What if upon my thorny fence Grow cornels, and the dam'sines dense, If oak and holmes, whose acrons show'r To feed the beasts, their lord embow'r? You'd think Tarentum nearer Rome, In all its verdant pride and bloom. A fountain too, that well might claim The rank to give a river name, (Than which cool Hebrus bounding Thrace, Shows not a more transparent face) Flows fraught with salutary aid, When head or bowels pains invade. This sweet retreat, which dale and hill, Believe me, are enchanting still, Preserve your Horace hale and stout, What time September comes about. You're a good man, if you take care To earn the character, you bear. I will all Rome have long agreed, That you're a happy man indeed; But fear from symptoms, that I trace, You any evidence embrace, Rather than conscience in this case; And think man's happiness the prize Of others, than the good and wise. Lest, tho' the people call you sound In mind and body, there be found A fever, which you wou'd conceal, In order to resume your meal, Until a nervous trembling seize Your hands, which with good cheer you grease. A fool's false shame his sores will hide, Till med'cines are in vain applied. If any man shou'd name to thee, Fights you had fought by land and sea, And strive your ticklish ear to please, With compliments as great as these: “May Jove! and all the pow'rs divine! “Who guard the common-wealth and thine, “Still make it doubtful on review, “Which is most anxious of the two, “Or you for Rome, or Rome for you!” What wou'd you challenge as your own, That which is Cæsar's praise alone? When you sit still to hear men call Thee wise, and without blame at all, Pray will you answer to these terms, And warrant what a fool affirms. 'Tis granted I, as well as you, Love to be held both wise and true. But he, who gives this praise to-day, The next can take it all away; Ev'n as, when they have giv'n their voice For one unworthy of their choice As consul, they can turn him out Soon as the year is come about— “Resign—'tis ours:”—with aching heart I do resign, and must depart. But shou'd the same tongues call me rogue, Or tax me with each vice in vogue, Or urge, I with a rope had tied My father's neck, until he died. Shou'd I change colour, or be stung At such lies of an evil tongue? Wrong-prais'd who's pleas'd, and wrong-arraign'd Who's griev'd, except the false and feign'd? Who then is good?—I'll tell thee who— He that observes with rev'rence due The statutes of the Conscript seers, And law and equity reveres: Who great and many things right fair Determines, when he takes the chair; Whose bond will property maintain, And testimony causes gain. Yet he is better understood In his own house and neighbourhood, To be all filthiness within, And clad but in a specious skin. If by a slave it shou'd be said, I have not robb'd your house, nor fled, I answer you have your reward, Ungall'd your shoulders with the cord. I've kill'd no man—you feed no crows Upon the gallows—I suppose, Still I am virtuous good and wise, All which your Sabine friend denies. The cautious wolf the pit forbears, As does the hawk suspected snares, Nor kite the cover'd hook will take— Wise men love good for goodness sake. If you from guilt still keep you clear, 'Tis on the principle of fear: But sure to come off safe and sound, You sacred and prophane confound. For if of garner'd beans you stole, From out a thousand but one bowl, The lighter is my loss and grief, But you by no means less a thief. An honest man upon your scheme, Whom every bar and court esteem, If he appease the pow'rs divine, At any day with beeves or swine, Upon Apollo loud he calls, And after father Janus bawls, Mean time he mutters to himself, As dreading hearers, “Charming elf! “Laverna! goddess of deceit, “Grant me the happy knack to cheat! “Grant me a seeming honest face, “And full of sanctified grimace: “In night my gross offences shroud, “And o'er my knav'ry cast a cloud!” I cannot see, the niggard dupe, Who for a farthing deigns to stoop, Stuck in the road—how he can be In any circumstance more free, Or better than a common slave; For he that is so prone to crave, Must ever lead a life of dread, And one with terrors in his head, Cannot have freedom in my sense— They lose their weapons of defence, And all desert fair virtue's post That hurry, who shall scrape the most. Yet if this slave a price will fetch, 'Tis better not destroy the wretch: He may turn out a useful hand, To feed the flock, or plough the land, Let him to sea, and winter there, To stock the market and the fair. A wise and good man will be bold To say with Bacchus kept in hold: “O king of Thebans! how much pain “Will you compel me to sustain, “So much unworthy this foul play?” Why I will take your goods away— “My cattle, bedding, and my plate, “I do suppose—then take them straight.” Beneath a surly keeper's nod You shall be pris'ner here, “A God “Shall save me, whenso'er I choose, “And all these bonds and fetters loose.” As hinting to the last event, Death here, I think, the poet meant; For death's the extremity suppos'd, By which the line of life is clos'd. EPISTLE XVII. To Scæva. He admonishes Scæva not to despise the friendship of people in Power, and that in his cast of life, he should rather imitate Aristippus than Diogenes. Tho', Scæva, of yourself discrete, You know how with grandees to treat, Yet still to these remarks attend, And take th'opinion of a friend, Who'll teach you things of great concern, Himself not yet too old to learn, As tho' the blind shou'd lead the way; Howev'r, observing what I say, You'll see some things, that must conduce To be of most peculiar use. If self-indulgence make thee gay, And kindly sleep till break of day, If dust and rumbling of the wheels, And noise in which the tavern deals, Offend thee, then you must repair To Ferentinum, I declare. For all the joys beneath the skies, The rich cannot monopolize; Nor has he done amiss, whose lease Of life were secrecy and peace. If you your family wou'd serve, And for your own content reserve A cast upon a higher die, Betimes you must the nobles ply. Had Aristippus been content To dine on herbs, he ne'er had went Unto the tables of the grand— Diogenes on t'other hand, Who to our notions will object, If he had skill'd in that respect, Might so have liv'd in splendid scenes, And wou'd have scorn'd his roots and greens: Whose words and actions of the two You best approve, I prithee shew; Or as you're junior hear the test, Why Aristippus reasons best. For he was wont (as stories say) To keep the Cynic thus at bay. The jester's province I profess, To serve myself with some address, But you to give the mob delight, So what I practise, as more right, Is a more honourable thing To ride and revel with the king. I am obsequious in my turn— You beg for what the donors spurn, Yet are inferior in your soul To him, that gives the sorry dole, Tho' you mean while your boast have made, You need not any human aid. Rare Aristippus, genius born, All lot and station to adorn, Each look of things a grace he lent, Tho' still aspiring, still content. But I shou'd think it very strange, If e'er the churl shou'd brook a change, Whose obstinacy will but wear Two rags, against th'inclement air. The one if summon'd to the great, Will not for purple vestments wait: But be his habit as it may, To the first place will make his way, And without awkardness and pain, Will any character sustain. The other fellow a fine cloak, Wrought at Miletum, wou'd provoke Worse than a mastiff, or a snake, And he with shiv'ring cold will ache, Unless his rags you give him back— Give them—and let him live and lack. Great actions of heroic lives, To shew to Rome her foe in gyves, Ev'n at Jove's throne directly aim, And there celestial honours claim. And such immortal chiefs as these, 'Tis not the meanest praise to please: But 'tis not ev'ry fawner's fate, To gain a point so very great. One fearing he shou'd not succeed, Was prudent to sit still—agreed— What then? was it not bravely done By him, that hit the mark and won. But here, or no where we must end The matter, which we now contend. One dreads the weight, too weak and poor In limbs and spirit to endure; The other makes the bus'ness sure. The man whose resolution tries Thro' hardship to attain the prize, Shou'd be rewarded and renown'd, Or virtue is an empty sound. He that before his Lord forbears To hint the dearth of his affairs, Is likely to take more away, Than one too apt to beg and pray. It differs much with modest ease To take, or greedily to seize; For in the conduct of your part, Lies all the myst'ry of your art. If thus a man his Lord address, “I have a sister portionless, “A mother poor with an estate, “Which will not sell at any rate, “Nor yields it, whence we may be fed:” Such an one plainly begs his bread; A second will keep up the cant, For you a dividend to grant. But if the crow had held her prate, She'd had more victuals and less hate, When bick'ring at her cruel fate. If when your Lord shou'd take his rout Far as Brundusium, or set out For fair Surrentum, and as friend Invite his client to attend: He who of rugged roads complains, Or bitter cold, or heavy rains, Or for his broken trunk laments, And for the loss of the contents, Resembles but too stale a bite, Which harlots practice every night, Oft wailing they've a garter lost, Or string of pearls of mighty cost: So that when really made a prey, No faith is giv'n to what they say. Nor cares a man, once made a fool, To be again th'impostor's tool, Who with pretended broken legs, Thrown in the road for succour begs, Ev'n tho' the gypsy stream with tears, And by the great Osiris swears— “This is no fraud, I pray believe, “And on your backs the lame receive.” Your tricks upon some stranger try, All the hoarse neighbourhood reply. EPISTLE XVIII. To Lollius. He instructs Lollius what is to be done, and what avoided, in order to render friendships permanent; and is particular upon a man's conduct in respect to a friend in power. Dear Lollius, if right well I ken The most ingenuous of men, Professor of a friendly heart, You scorn to act a flatt'rer's part. A Roman matron is not more Distinguish'd from a painted whore, Than a true friend, from the disguise Of him that faithless deals in lies. There is a vice reverse of this, And of the two the more amiss, A clownish harshness blunt and base, Which wou'd commend itself to grace, With tweazer'd face, and shaven skin, And teeth all dirty-black within, Intending that it shou'd appear, As downright honest and sincere. Virtue between each vice resides, Alike remote from both the sides. The one's submission's far too great, And jester of the lowest seat The rich-man's nod he so reveres, And so respects, whate'er he hears, And catches up each word that falls, Like boys, whose rigid master calls To say their lesson, or a play'r, That must his under-part prepare. The other's full of gross abuse, About the milking of a goose, And fights with trifles arm'd, “How now? “What? credit not to me allow? “What boldly shall not I give vent, “Unto my heart's true sentiment? “I wou'd not hold another year, “On terms so monstrously severe?” But what's the theme of all this fray? If Castor best his weapon play, Or Docilis shall win the day? Or if Brundusium best to make, A man the Appian road shou'd take? Whom deadly lewdness strips, or dice That speediest lead to want by vice, Whom vanity too grand shall dress, And dawbs with essence to excess, Whom thirst and hunger after gold Possesses, not to be controul'd, Blushing and shunning to be poor, Him his rich friend cannot endure, And oft persues with dread and hate, Himself far more inordinate. And, if he does not hate, he rules, And as a pious mother schools Her son, her virtues to out-do, He thus adds something pretty true. “My wealth (pray do not you contend) “Admits of all my follies, friend, “Your small estate shou'd make you loth “To cut your coat beyond your cloath, “And, if your senses you retain, “Cease contest, where the contest's vain.” Eutrapelus whene'er intent To do a man much detriment, Wou'd give him gaudy cloaths, “For so “Blest in the notion of a beau, “He'll take new measures, form new schemes, “Indulge till noon in pleasing dreams: “Will for a whore his trade postpone, “Will give huge int'rest for a loan; “Will learn at last the fencer's art, “Or drive for hire a gard'ner's cart.”— Into no secrecies inquire; Keep confidence repos'd intire, Tho' put to torture by the force Of wine, or passionate discourse. Nor must you praise your own persuit, And that of your great friend dispute: Nor with your poetry solace Your muse, when he prefers the chace. For by such means Amphion cross'd His brother, and his kindness lost; Till he gave up his lyre, at last, To him of the severer cast. Amphion therefore did give way To Zethus' temper, as they say. And do you in likewise attend The mild injunctions of your friend, And when into the field he gets His dogs, and his Etolian nets, Arise, and for a while refuse, Th'ill-bred moroseness of your Muse, That you may sup upon the spoil, Thus purchas'd by your mutual toil. This exercise for health and bloom, Habitual to the sons of Rome, Is useful ev'n to life, and fame, And keeps the feet from being lame; But chiefly while you're young and sound, And can in speed out-strip the hound, And foil the fury of the boar. Then add to what we've urg'd before, Not one of those, which arms profess, Can handle them with more address. You know what vast applause you gain, In all those feats on Mars's plain: In fine, as yet of tender age, You cou'd in cruel fights engage, And those Cantabrian wars endur'd, Beneath that chief, who has procur'd Our standards from the Parthian host, And fix'd them in their wonted post; And now does all the acts that tend To make the Roman arms transcend. And lest you from the sports recede, Without a good excuse to plead, (Tho' nothing trifling, or uncooth, You e'er committed from your youth) Yet, where your rural villa lies, You pleasant pastimes can devise. The naval troops divide the boats, And all the Actian battle floats, Acted by boys, in hostile pride, Which you, as their commander, guide; Your brother's the fictitious foe, And Adria's sea the ponds below, Till victory, with bays, come down, And one or other champion crown. Great Cæsar, when he once shall see Your taste and his so well agree, Shall give you, and your little bands Immense applause, with both his hands, Now let me (if a man like you Can need advice) advise you true. Oft take good heed what, and to whom, You speak of every man in Rome; A pumper shun, who will not fail To bear materials of a tale, Nor can the ears that spring a leak, With faith retain the things you speak, And when one word to such you pawn, It is irrevocably gone. By frequent observations trace, Him you wou'd recommend to grace; Lest you anon shou'd be asham'd Of faults, for which another's blam'd. We sometimes are deceiv'd, and raise A person who's not worthy praise. Thus chous'd, forbear to vindicate Him, whose own conduct mars his fate. So one well prov'd you shall protect, If false accusers ought object, And shield him confident in you; If slander's tooth his fame persue, Perceive you not your danger too? For 'tis a very near concern To you, when neighb'ring houses burn, And flames by negligence are fed, And still are wont to get a head. The cultivation of esteem With men in pow'r, to those may seem Desirous, who have never tried, But by experience is decried. When once your vessel's under sail, Ply well your business, lest the gale Shou'd shift upon th'inconstant main, And drive your vessel back again. The sad, abominate the gay; These scorn the children of dismay; The volatile the dull sedate; Idlers, the brisk and active hate. They that all night will ply the glass, Despise you, if your turn you pass, Tho' with solemnity you swear, You dread th'effects of midnight air. Your forehead of its gloom uncloud, For 'tis in general allow'd, Too modest men appear, as dark, Too silent, curs that cannot bark. In all, with which you are concern'd, You must consult and read the learn'd, Who on the proper measures treat, To make your life serene and sweet; Lest greedy av'rice, ever poor, Still make you anxious thoughts endure, Lest fear and hope distract your mind, For things of an indifferent kind: That you may know if nature teach, Or virtue be what scholars preach, What lessens care, encreases smiles, And your own conscience reconciles, What makes a perfect calm, a name, Or wealth, which still is pleasure's aim, Or life's whole passage to fulfil, Thro' flowery bye-paths snug and still. As oft as on Digentia's brink, Whose cool streams all Mandela drink, A little village chopt with cold, Myself I at my ease behold, What are my sentiments, my friend, For what do you think my knees I bend? That what I have of present store Be kept, or rather less than more, That if the Gods more life shou'd give, I may for self-improvement live, With choice of the best books to read, And year's provision for my need, Lest I shou'd be in fortune's pow'r, Dependent on th'uncertain hour; Thus much is fit of Jove to pray, Ev'n he that gives and takes away: Let him long life and wealth bestow, I trust from my own heart to know, All things that make for peace below. EPISTLE XIX. To Mæcenas. He reprehends the false zeal certain writers had to imitate the defects, rather than the perfections of the poets. Dear Friend, if you the lore embrace Of old Cratinus, in this case No verse can last, or charm the age, Wrote by the water-drinking sage; And this has been a maxim fix'd, E'er since the brain-sick bards were mix'd, By Liber's laws injoin'd to rove With fawns and satyrs of the grove: Hence all the muses sweetly gay, Oft smell of wine at early day. When ????? ?? ???????? ????? ???? ????? ?????, and sundry other places. Homer call'd the grape divine, He wrote his verses by his wine; And Ennius, our reverend sire, Wou'd not to sing of arms aspire, Till for his subject made a match By drink—I therefore shall dispatch The sneaking milk-sops one and all, For sentence to the judgment-hall, Nor will I any licence grant, For those to sing, who whine and cant. Soon as this edict was promulg'd, The poets night and day indulg'd The bumpers they wou'd not abate.— What if a man shou'd imitate The naked feet, and surly frown Of Cato, with his scanty gown? Wou'd he be instantly endued With Cato's worth and rectitude. The mimic, who propos'd to please By taking off Timagenes, With envy burst, as he in vain Did after wit and utt'rance strain. Mean imitation foils the base, As faults are all that they can trace, As tho', when I've a pallid hue, They shou'd take drugs to be so too. O mimics! scarce above the brutes! How very frequently the fruits, Of that in which each bungler prides, Provok'd my wrath, or split my sides? A sheer original from God, I stalk'd upon the vacant sod, Nor in another's footsteps trod. He who as leader can perform His part in justice heads the swarm. I first made Italy repeat, Iambics of the Parian beat, Form'd on Archilochus, to tow'r At once in harmony and pow'r, But not pursuing of his scheme, To kill my brother with my phlegm; And lest I shou'd from Rome receive A crown that sparing critics weave, Because I fear'd to undertake The changing measure of his make: There's Sappho, writing like a man, Corrects and variegates my plan; Alcæus too—but all the while Diverse in numbers and in stile, Nor does he now unto his shame, Seek his step-father to defame, Nor strangle, in poetic wrath, The maid to whom he pledg'd his troth: Him, who was never known before, I harp'd upon the Latian shore: For 'tis my pleasure to be new, And read by an ingenuous few. Now wou'd you know the real cause, My readers give me such applause, Fond of my arch-instructive tomes, When sung within their private homes; But soon as e'er they quit their place Degrade me—this is then the case. To count the suffrage of the mob, I ever thought too mean a job, By treating them with dainty fare, And rags and tatters for their wear. I hear no writings of the great, Nor in revenge my own repeat; Nor do I hie me to the schools Of those, that teach the grammar-rules— Hence all this grievance—if I say, I am asham'd my worthless lay In crouds theatric to recite; As tho' I wou'd to things so light A thought of dignity and weight In rank presumption arrogate. At us (says one) your honour sneers, Preserving for celestial ears Your poetry—for you distill Alone, it seems, the honey'd rill, A person in your own sweet eyes, Extremely beautiful and wise. At taunts like these, I do not dare To let my nose have too much air, And lest their nails my skin deface, I cry, I do not like this place, And beg a truce—for gamesome jest Brings on a trial, who is best, Then emulation furthers strife, And that ill-blood, and loss of life. EPISTLE XX. To his Book. You seem to cast, my vent'rous book, Towards the town a wishful look, That thee the chapmen may demand, Where Janus, and Vertumnus stand; When polish'd by the binder's art.— Both keys and seals, with all your heart, You hate, and every thing refuse Which all your modest volumes chuse. You grudge that you are shewn to few, Desirous of the public view, On other principles compil'd— Away then, since you are so wild— When once set off there's no return— Soon shall you say with much concern— Ah! wretch, what wou'd I, when your pride Is by some reader mortified, And in some narrow nook you stick, When curiosity is sick, But if the augur do not dream, In wrath for this your desp'rate scheme; At Rome you'll be a welcome guest, As long as you are new at least. But when all dirty you become, In witness of the vulgar thumb, Or groveling book-worms you must feed, Or for us Utica shall speed; Or bundled up in packthread chain, Be sent a transport into Spain. The good adviser, all the while, To whom you gave no heed, will smile: As he who from the mountain threw The sulky ass, that wou'd not do His bus'ness—“then go down the hill— “Who'd save an ass against his will.” This destiny too must remain— Thee faultring dotage shall detain About the city-skirts to teach The boys their rudiments of speech. And when the servency of day Brings you more hearers, you must say, That poor and meanly born at best, I spread my wings beyond my nest, And what you from my birth subtract, You for my virtues must exact; That peace or war, I still was great, With the first pillars of the state, Short-siz'd, and prematurely grey, Form'd for th'intensity of day, With passion ev'n to phrenzy seiz'd, But very easily appeas'd. If any person by the bye Shou'd ask how old I am, reply, That when the fasces were assign'd, To Lepidus and Lollius join'd, I was full out, and fairly told, Four times eleven Decembers old. THE SECOND BOOK OF THE EPISTLES OF HORACE. EPISTLE I. To Augustus. He complains of the depraved taste amongst the Romans of his time, who estimated the merit of poems by their antiquity, and despised modern ones, for no other reason than that they were modern. Since you alone sustain the state, Midst things so various and so great, And while your arms our coast defend, To moral pulchritude attend, Correcting us with wholesome laws, Twere sin against the common cause Was I to pen a tedious strain, Thy time, Augustus, to detain. Rome's Founder, Bacchus, and the seed Of Leda, men of might indeed, And for their works in heav'n receiv'd, Yet while on earth conjointly griev'd, That human favour, human fame, By no means answer'd to their claim, As cultivators of mankind, That special property assign'd, And cities built, and lands dispos'd, And finally dissentions clos'd. The man that brought the Hydra down, And beasts of horrible renown Subdu'd by his predestin'd toil, Found yet their was a foe to foil, Ev'n Envy, whose infernal blast Cou'd not be worsted but the last. He galls, whose merits overbear The puny wits, with lust'rous glare, Hated while he retains his breath, And lov'd for nothing but his death. To you, tho' with us, we bestow The full-blown honours, as they grow, And to your name those altars rear, Which men upon their oath revere, Confessing that a man like thee, Nor has been, nor again shall be. But here your people wise to own The truth, in this one point alone, (That is to place your matchless fame Above each Greek and Roman name) Cannot be made at any rate, Thus other things to estimate, And still their futile venom spawn, On all that are not dead and gone: Such favourers of dusty shelves, They will assert the Nine themselves, Upon mount Alban did ordain Those tables that the laws contain; The leagues our antient monarchs made, With neighbours for their mutual aid, The Pontiff's rolls, and each record The Angurs College keeps in ward. If, as the oldest Greeks are best, You say the same thing of the rest And prove our writers by that test; Your tongue at once all truth disowns, Nuts have no shells, nor olives stones. We've reach'd the highest pitch in arts, In painting, music, shew our parts And wrestle cleaner on the stage Than active Greeks, in any age. If keeping to a certain date, Like wine one's poems meliorate: I fain wou'd know the very year That makes this sage decision clear. Who died an hundred years ago, Is he an ancient good or no? Or must he rather be referr'd, And scorn'd amongst the modern herd. Here something positive will suit, To put the matter past dispute— Well he's an ancient true and good, Who for an hundred years has stood: But what for him do you deicde Who month or year his junior dy'd? Him will you condescend to place, Amongst the vet'ran's in this case, Or such as are condemn'd to scoff Both now and many ages off? Him then you say, we may be bold In honesty, to rank as old Who did the junior depart One month, or year—with all my heart— From your concessions if you please, I pull the tail off by degrees, And certainly shall dock the mare If once I work it hair by hair, Till like an heap that falls to ground, I my opponent shall confound, Who to the almanacs adheres, And reckons eminence by years; And nothing will applaud at all But trophies from a funeral. Ennius th'ingenious and the strong, A second Homer for his song, (As critics estimate the bard) Seems now but lightly to regard His dreams, of what shou'd come to pass, And figments of Pythagoras. Nævius, altho' he be not read, Is fresh in every person's head, All ancient verse is held so dread. When critic desputants contest, Which of the poets is the best. Ennius his nephew, by his sister, born at Brundusium.Pacuvius is for learning prais'd, And Accius reckon'd great and rais'd; Afranius all the town admit His gown wou'd on Menander sit. Plautus still keeps each sketch in view, Sicilian Epicharmus drew: Cœcilius did in weight excel, And Terence in conducting well. These mighty Rome by heart has got, With these cram'd theatres are hot. These are the poets of the stage From Livius Andronicus. Livius to the present age. Sometimes the populace are right, Sometimes remote from reason quite. If poets of the former days At such a rate th'admirers praise, So that they nothing will prefer Or ev'n compare with them, they err; If they but fairly wou'd confess, Some things are in too stale a dress, Most lines put down too harsh and rough, And many errant idle stuff, Then are they wisemen, and agree With what is very truth—and me. I do not for Here Horace dissents from Cicero, who tells us that the comedies of this person were not worth a second reading. my part devote To silence, all that Livius wrote, Who when a boy, that flogging cull Orbilius hammer'd in my skull, But am astonish'd they appear, To any beautiful and near To finish'd—for 'mongst many lines If but one bright expression shines, And midst the lamentable whole, One verse or two harmonious roll, In every righteous man's despite It carries off th'edition quite. 'Tis wrath—when works they discommend, Not that they're stupid or ill penn'd, But merely for their modern date: And for the ancients arrogate, Rewards and reputation too, When pardon barely is their due. Shou'd a man question in this age If Atta tread the The Roman theatre was sprinkled with saffron-water for the refreshment of the audience. essenc'd stage With grace or not, our sires wou'd roar That modesty is now no more, Those parts by me to be disdain'd, Whence grave Esopus glory gain'd, And which learn'd Roscius too sustain'd. Because they think, there's nothing right But which is pleasing in their sight, Or that they hold themselves disgrace't If once their juniors set the taste, And that when young (they must allow) They learnt, what they shou'd cancel now. Who Numa's Salian hymn wou'd praise And such strange stuff, which now a days Cannot be understood, when read, Does not so much applaud the dead, As his invidious taunts he show'rs On us and every thing of ours. But if in Greece new things had been Thus odious, how shou'd we have seen One ancient, how had they remain'd With which we all are entertain'd? When first upon a gen'ral peace They learn'd to play the fool in Greece, And into luxury to slide By fortune fav'ring wind and tide, Now wrestlers, now the race alone, Now works in iv'ry or in stone, Now busts, now pictures were admir'd Thro' which the very soul transpired. Now were they fond of pipe, now plays Full of those wild infantine ways, Like little misses when they're nurst Soon slighting what so pleas'd at first. Nought sweeten'd and nought made them sour But had mutations every hour. Such were the things that peace cou'd do, And all the prosp'rous gales that blew. In Rome it was in much repute, And held a pleasant task to boot, Betimes each morning to be found And to a client laws expound; Cash with great caution to put out; To be attentively devout To hear the old—the young direct How wealth may grow and lust be check'd. Light fashion now has chang'd our mind, All are to verse alone inclin'd, Each boy and rigid elder's crown'd With bays, and as the cup goes round At supper will their lines rehearse— Ev'n I, who swear I make no verse, Am found a Parthian to outlie, And e'er the Sun's a second high, Call for my ink with quick demand, My pen, my paper and my stand. A man that knows not how to steer A ship, will such an office fear; No one with drugs the sick will aid Who was not 'prentice to the trade— They're doctors who the art profess, Smiths use their hammers with address, But wits or blockheads, wrong or right, We one and all must verse indite But yet this error in degree This tincture of insanity How much the virtues it can serve Please in this manner to observe. The poet seldom on the whole Has got an avaricious soul, Verse is his study and delight— At detriments of fire and flight Of servants he securely smiles, By craft no neighbour he beguiles, No pupil of his trust, as fed On homely husks and second bread: Tho' slow and useless in the war, Rome's weal is that he's ever for, And if you'll grant me this withal That great things are upheld by small, The infant's mouth the poets frame, And tune their language lisping—lame. Weans from bad words their ears betimes With friendly care their heart sublimes; Corrects their rudeness, all the seeds Of envy or of passion weeds; Records good actions with the pen And in the lives of glorious men Instructs hereafter, to the poor And weakly gives a gentle cure. How shou'd good boys and girls regard Their pray'rs, had heav'n denied a bard! The chorus for heav'n's aid applies And feels the present deities, Sweet in mysterious pray'r the rain They from the highest heav'n obtain, Avert disease, stave dang'rous fears Bring peace with rich and fruitful years: The gods above, the pow'rs below By verse their consolation know. Our ancient rustics hale and rough, And with a little bless'd enough, Soothing upon their garner'd grain Their limbs and minds, which cou'd sustain, In hopes of respite, grievous pain; With children and with faithful wife, And fellow-craft in rural life, The goddess Tellus with a swine, Sylvanus with the milk and kine, All worshipp'd, and with wine and flow'rs The genius of the mental pow'rs Who's mindful still that life is fleet And thence invites to make it sweet. From sports like these driv'n to excess Came Fescennine licentiousness, Which pour'd out clownish verse profuse In dialogue and gross abuse, Which grateful liberty each year Was rather cheerful than severe. At length the jest too far inhanc'd To downright open rage advanc'd, And while impunity remain'd Upon ingenuous houses gain'd, The suff'rers from their bloody frangs Were tortur'd with most cruel pangs, And many, tho' unhurt, were grieved, That men such injuries receiv'd, The senate made a law in fine Which did a penalty injoin, If any man they shou'd asperse; And point out in satiric verse, They were oblig'd to change their plan For fear of beating, and began Their works poetic to dispense For pleasure and benevolence. Bow'd to our arms the captive Greece, Took the fierce victor on the peace And introduced politer arts In Italy's more rustic parts; Thus lines of barbarism and scoff, Prais'd in Saturnian times, flow'd off, And elegance, which must be neat Did squalled filthiness defeat, Yet this (as former times) retains Some traces of the rough remains. 'Twas late e'er they their talents tried And to the Grecian style applied; And both the Punic wars were o'er E'er they set by th'Athenian lore, And made enquiry by degrees, What Æsculus, and Sophocles, And Thespis, had of useful vein, And strove too, if they might attain Each author's beauties to translate, Conscious of natures high and great. For spirit we've enough in Rome, And wear with grace the Tragic plume, But cannot bear to be correct, And hate a blot as a defect. The comic muse that draws her scene From things of common life and mean, Is thought to smell too much of sweat: But the less favour it can get, The more of study it shou'd take. Observe how Plautus paints his rake, How stupidly th'old huncks is drawn, And crafty bawds that huff and fawn; How much Dorsennus' muse delights In eating and in parasites, Who treads the stage an errant slouch For while there's money in his pouch, With him is no concern at all Whether the Drama stand or fall. He, whom vain-glory's chariot draws Upon the stage for mere applause, Faints when the audience languid grows, But when they're lively puffs and blows. So light, so trivial are the things By which a spirit flags or springs, That's covetous of praise—Farewel All thought in writing to excel, If glory giv'n or ta'en away Make me look fat or lean a day— This too makes many a bard withold And well may terrify the bold, That those who're of no worth possess'd Or name, out-number all the rest, Unlearn'd and dolts and prone to box When a knight's taste their fancy shocks: These midst the most inchanting airs Demand the wrestlers and the bears, For in all such the mob delights: Nay ev'n the pleasure of our knights, Driv'n from judicious ears, decoys Th'uncertain eyes to gewgaw toys. —Three or four hours the curtain's drawn And horse and foot at once come on, March o'er the stage with hapless kings, Their hands behind them tied in slings, Then chariots, litters, ships and wains And slaves with iv'ry drag'd in chains, And Corinth, to conclude the whole, Is carried on a cloth and pole. Democritus, was he on earth, Wou'd fairly burst his sides with mirth, To see the people staring hard Upon some strange camelo-pard, Or on an elephant all white, The mob wou'd more attract his sight, Than all the fun upon the stage, Mean time he'd find the author's rage, On a deaf ass, was spent in vain, For who can rant in such a strain, As all that din to over-bear, With which they drown both house and play'r. You'd think Garganian forests roar, Or billows on the Tuscan shore: With so much clamour from their hearts, The foreign gems, and wealth, and arts, In which the actor's trick'd, are view'd, For when he comes, in claps renew'd, The right-hand and the left agree— Has he said any thing?—Not he— Whence therefore all this wond'rous glee? From robe of true Tarentian die, Whose tints may with the violet vie; And lest you think that I degrade With sparing praise, what I'm affraid To undertake myself, when done By others for a general run, Know then, that far above my hopes That poet treads the highest ropes, With fictious grief who wounds my breast, Inflames, serenes, disturbs my rest With magic terrors, that he makes, And now to Thebes, now Athens takes. But Cæsar, take a little care Of writers, that the stage forbear, Who for the closet bards commence, And dread an haughty audience, So shall that library be fill'd To Phœbus, which you rose to build, And bards have spurs for new essays, To gain the Heliconian bays. We poets oft to mar the plot Of our own comrades are, got wot, Too apt to do ourselves much wrong, When we present th' There are more passages in Horace (particular, a caution to Lollius, and his own reason of forbearance to Trebatius) that shew, what extreme address it required to approach Augustus with verses, who tho' he loved them, and could make them, yet did not choose they should interfere with certain times and circumstances. obtrusive song To thoughtful patrons, when in league With sleepy dulness, thro' fatigue: When we are pain'd, if any friend Has dar'd to call one line ill-penn'd; When tho' unask'd, we read again The place that did small praise obtain, Griev'd that our works so very clear, And finely spun did not appear; When we indulge our hopes, in fine, That when our verses we divine, You'll cite us of your own accord, Force us to write for a reward, Nor dream of want, when you're Lord. And yet 'tis worth the while to know, Who shou'd be virtue's priest below, Who gives to their immortal tome Your worth in battle and at home, Themes far too sacred for a bard, That is not worthy prime regard. Lov'd by the Macedonian youth Was Chærilus, whose verse uncouth, And vilely made, cou'd yet purloin An hoard of royal Philip's coin. But as the ink not manag'd right Leaves blots, so scriblers that indite Bald verses, must their theme debase, And the most shining acts disgrace. This same king, who cou'd verses buy So stupid, at a price so high, Cou'd make an edict of restraint, That not a hand his face shou'd paint Except Apelles, nor in brass Shou'd bustos for his likeness pass, Sav'd form'd in fam'd Lysippus' mould— Now shou'd a person make so bold, This monarch's judgment to refer To books and bards, one might aver, Or even undertake to swear, His birth was in Bœotian air. But those, your fav'rite sons of song, Virgil and Varius, do not wrong Your judgment, or the gifts that crown Theirs and the donor's just renown. Nor are the lineaments more just, When cast into a brazen bust, Than in th'immortal poet's lays, Appear the spirit and the ways Of heroes—I am none of those Who wou'd prefer your creeping prose, To the describing mighty acts, Earth's, rivers, and extensive tracts, And tow'rs upon the mountains built, And kingdoms of barbarian guilt, With all the wars constrain'd to cease, By proclamation of your peace, And Janus' temple lock'd and barr'd, To stand for Concord upon guard, And Rome, that now the Parthians dread, Because Augustus is our head. All this supposing I cou'd do, As well as is my wish, is true. But nor your grandeur will admit Of grov'lers, nor can I think fit, In modesty a theme to try, Which for my size is far too high. An author's zeal that's too intense, Will urge his folly to offence; But most so, when he acts his part In numbers, and poetic art: For things ridiculously wrong, Will to the mem'ry stick more strong, Than passages of better thought, For praise and admiration wrote. Were I a patron I shou'd feel Uneasiness for ill-tim'd zeal, Nor like by any means to spy My ugly likeness in a die, Nor choose to be a heroe call'd, In verses miserably bald, Left I shou'd blush, when forc'd to take The gifts fat dulness comes to make, And in an open trunk repine, To see my author's name and mine; Or carried off those streets behold, Where all-spice and perfumes are sold, And fritter'd into many a scrap, Be doom'd all sorts of trash to wrap. EPISTLE II. To Julius Florus. He makes his apology to Julius Florus, who complained that he neither sent him any letter, nor those verses, which he had promised. Florus, great Nero's faithful friend, Shou'd any man by chance commend A little stripling, to be bought From Gabii, or from Tibur brought, And thus begin with you to treat, “This boy, Sir, 's of a temper sweet, “And sightly ev'n from head to foot, “And he his Lord's commands will suit; “Pay me but fifty pounds—he goes— “A little Greek the youngster knows. “Like clay for models, you with ease “Can make him learn whate'er you please; “His voice, tho' rude, is well to pass, “And entertaining o'er a glass. “Huge promises will credit lose, “When any man is too profuse “In praising what he wants to sell: “Necessity does not compel “That he must needs be sold as yet, “Tho' poor I am in no man's debt; “There's not a dealer you cou'd find, “So much unto your honour's mind, “And there's not any man but you “That I wou'd thus oblige—'tis true, “This boy, (as often is the way) “Did once upon an errant stay, “Then fled, thro' fear to feel the pangs “Of whip, that on the stair-case hangs, “Wherefore if this, his only vice, “Offend you not, pay down the price.” The man may for his money call, And be indemnified withal, According to my skill in trade; You wittingly a purchase made Of him, who for a knave was sold, But the conditions were foretold, And yet you will th'affair dispute, And forward an unrighteous suit. I told you, when you went away, That I was idle, out of play, Nor cou'd such offices abide— I told you that you might not chide, When from my hands no letter came. But what's all this, if you disclaim Conditions for myself I made, And furthermore your friend upbraid, That he's no better than a liar, Not sending verse, as you require. After much hardship in the fight, As tir'd he snor'd away the night, A soldier of Lucullus' host, His money to a farthing lost; From this a rav'nous wolf he grows, Wroth with himself, as with his foes, Fierce rushing, with his hungry fangs, From off their post he soundly bangs A royal guard (as they report) And took their stores and strongest fort. By such great gallantry renown'd, He is with highest honours crown'd: The Chief besides to him decrees, Full fifty thousand sesterces. It happen'd just upon this feat, His captain was intent to beat The foe, and batter their redoubt— Words that wou'd make a coward stout, He to the self-same man addrest, “Go thou the bravest and the best, “Go where thy valour calls, and speed “About to share rewards indeed! “Why do you stand debating—march!”— On which my chap extremely arch, Tho' but a clown, made answer back, “Let him go foremost to th'attack, “His lance at your command to couch, “Who's fall'n asleep, and lost his pouch.” It was my lot in tender age At Rome, to con th'Homeric page, How by the wrath of Peleus' son, The Grecian councils were undone; Ingenuous Athens added more, Of what is call'd the useful lore, The right from its reverse to know, And in the search of truth to go, Where solitary wisdom roves, And thinks in academic groves. But the perverseness of the time, Displac'd me from that pleasant clime, And, e're I knew whom I was for, Involv'd in tides of civil war, And arms, in which there was no hope That they shou'd with Augustus cope, From whence when we were all dispers'd, And from Philippi sent amerc'd, With my wings clipt, and heart unmann'd, And destitute of house and land, Compell'd by poverty intense, I boldly did a bard commence. But now remote from being poor, What med'cines cou'd my phrenzy cure, If I should write or verse, or prose, In preference to my repose? The fleeting years from spring to fall, Have fairly rob'd me of my all, My jests, my gallantry, my play, And revellings are ta'en away. Now they're exerting of their force, The very Muses to divorce, Then how shou'd I direct my course? In short, all matters do not strike On every personage alike; The ode is by your choice preferr'd, He likes iambics, and a third The satires written on the plan Of Bion, that invet'rate man; Here are three guests, cannot approve Of the same dish, or same remove; What shall I give, or what refuse, You spurn the things that others chuse, And what's acceptable to you Will give offence to t'other two. Besides all this, pray how do you think A man can harmonize his ink, At Rome, amidst his toils and cares And all his intricate affairs? One summons me to be his bail, And one to hear him without fail, While he, forsooth, his work recites! To mount Quirinus one invites, The other two I must attend, On Aventine the farther end. Both must be visited, you see The distance suits one charmingly: But never mind the streets are clear, Fit for the thoughtful and severe; A builder hurries with his mules, And porter bearing chips and tools; The timber-tug, now whirls a stone, And now a log to break a bone; Now a dispute is likewise made 'Twixt waggon, and the sad parade Of fun'ral pomp—a mad dog now, Now rushes a most filthy sow: Go, poet, make your verses neat, And let their melody be sweet. Thro' all their choir, the gen'ral run Of bards love groves, and cities shun, Due votaries of Bacchus made, Rejoicing in repose and shade. Must I then sing the tuneful lay Amidst such din both night and day, And up hill strive the steps to trace Of poetry's retarded race. A genius who has made retreat, In Athens leisure-loving seat, And there his constitution wears Sev'n years immers'd in books and cares. Sometimes comes out into the town, A mere dumb statue in a gown, Till all the people shake their sides— But how in all these boistrous tides And tempests of the city-throng Can I associate lyre and song! At Rome together liv'd of late, A dab in tropes and advocate, Those men were brothers, and so near Allied, that they wou'd only hear Their mutual praise, in mutual speech, Gracchus and Mucius, each to each. Why shou'd this wrath of complaisance Be less in them that sing and dance? I write but odes, another sings His elegies, amazing things Trick't up by all the muses train— Observe you first, with what disdain, And what importance for ourselves, We view the Of Palatine Apollo. temple's vacant shelves. Next if your leisure is inclin'd, Yourself may follow us behind, And hear us quote and judge the cause We crown each other with applause. We work in counterfeited fight, Like samnite blades till candle-light. I am Alceus the divine, By his decree—who's he by mine? Callim'chus, if I underate, Mimnermus more divinely great. Much do I bear to keep in grace With bards, that irritable race, Whilst I myself to get the bays, Submissive court the people's praise, But having now my studies clos'd, Quite sound, tho' lately indispos'd, I can, secure of former fears, Against reciters stop my ears. The makers of your wretched strains, By all are laugh'd at for their pains; But in the writing they rejoice, And for themselves will give their voice, And if you let their praise alone, The men are happy in their own. But whoso chuses to compile A work in genuine form and style, Shou'd with his pen assume the mind Of critic, honest and refin'd; He boldly will all words displace, Devoid of cleanness and of grace, Such as are destitute of weight, Such as are not sublime and great; All these your blotting hand require, Howe'er unwilling to retire, And deem'd eternal for their fire. Such phrazes, as from Rome have long Been hid, he will receive in song, And kindly bring to light again Words, which ideas best explain, The language of the great and just, Tho' now disus'd thro' age and rust. New words he likewise will invent, All founded on experiment: At once strong, musical, and clear, Like some pure river he'll appear, And pour out his redundant store Abroad upon th'Italian shore; What's too luxuriant he will pare, To what is harsh he'll give an air; What has no worth he'll take away, He'll ape the mimic in the play, With his invention on the rack, While now he has the Satyr's knack, And now like Cyclops must advance, Stupendous in the clumsy dance. I'd rather be esteem'd a fool, And object of all ridicule, Self-entertain'd, or self-deceiv'd, Than with my wisdom be aggriev'd. At Argos once it came to pass, A personage of no mean class, Set in a theatre at ease Alone, and clapt himself to please, Supposing that he hear'd the play'r, Divinely tragedizing there: And yet in other points of view, This man cou'd all his duty do, Good neighbour, courteous to his guest, And with kind love his wife carest, Indulgent to forgive a slave, So as not actually to rave, If he had dar'd to tap his wine— Wou'd well, or precipice decline— At length by care, and by expence Of friends, recovering his sense. “Good sirs, (says she) be all assur'd, “You've kill'd me, rather than have cur'd, “Who've rob'd my thoughts of sweet employ, “And all my visionary joy.”— 'Tis granted life is best apply'd To wisdom, throwing toys aside; Leave then to boys all childish play, Theirs is the proper time of day, Nor merely think on words to dwell, Adapted to the Latian shell, But method and array to scan, Which tend to harmonize the man: Wherefore I with myself converse, And only things like these rehearse: “If, tho' you drank untill you burst, “No water yet wou'd quench your thirst, “To doctors you wou'd tell th'affair, “How is it that you do not dare, “By frank confession to explain, “The more you've got, the more you'd gain. “If from a root or herb prescrib'd, “Your wound no healing balm imbib'd, “That herb, or root, you'd surely shun, “By which you found no good was done; “You by some conjurer was told, “To whom the Gods give store of gold, “From him depravity of heart, “And folly shall of course depart; “But since you are no wiser grown, “With all this plenitude your own, “Why have you therefore any more “The same advisers, as before? “But if wealth made you wise of soul, “Your lusts and terrors to controul, “You ought to blush if earth cou'd shew “A man more covetous than you. If goods your property are found, Bought by the penny, and the pound; And some things (as the law assures) Are wholly by possession yours; The field that feeds you is your own, And while he harrows it when sown, The hind of Orbus still imputes The right to him that has the fruits. You give your cash receiving more, Grapes, pullets, eggs, and wine galore, Till by degrees the farm you've made, For which p'rhaps the owner paid, (To speak upon a mod'rate guess) Three hundred thousand sesterces. What boots it if your food you owe To things bought now or long ago! He, who that Aricinian spot, Or field of Veiens lately got, Sups on bought-herbs, tho' he thinks not. Nay more, he boils his very food Each frosty night with purchas'd wood; And yet they're all his freehold lands As far as where the poplar stands, And is the limit too forefend, Disputes at law 'twixt friend and friend, As if ought was a man's estate, Which in one moment of his date; Now by petition, now by pay, By violence another day, Or by the common lot of all, May to some other owner fall. Then since for ever is not here, Heir making heir still disappear, As wave o'er wave the billows rise, Then what are towns, or granaries, Or cou'd you join, your flocks to feed, Calabrian with Lucanian mead, Since stern inexorable fate, Unbrib'd by gold mows small and great? Gems, marble, iv'ry, busts, and plate, Fine pictures, and rich robes of state, There are who never can acquire, There are who no such things desire. Why of two brethern one consumes His time in idling, play, perfumes, Nor heeds rich Herod's palm-estate; The other, miserably great, From morn to night with fire and steel, Seeks with his forest fields to deal; Our guiding genius here on earth That rules the planet of our birth, The best can certify, ev'n he, Our nature's true divinity, That o'er our heads exerts his might And cheques our lives with black and white. I'll freely take with mod'rate hands, As much as exigence demands, Nor will I waste a single care, About th'opinion of my heir, When at his coming he shall find No augmentation left behind. Yet I with measures thus advis'd, Am still inclin'd to be appris'd, How much the chearful and the free, Is distant from the debauchee, And what distinction exists 'Twixt misers and oeconomists. For know there is a diff'rence quite, Shou'd you waste ev'ry thing out-right, Or only spread a plent'ous board, Nor seek addition to your hoard: But rather self and friend enjoy By fits and starts, as when a boy, Glad of the breaking-up retreat, As shorter so by far more sweet. Let dirty poverty, I pray, Be far, yea very far away; And be my vessel small or strong, Let me go uniform along, The wind, perhaps, is not so fair, Sails swelling with the Northern air, And yet I have not in my mouth The tempest of the adverse South. In force, in genius, figure, weight, In virtue, station, and estate, The last of them that foremost go, But captain of the band below. You are not covetous—go to— But have you manhood to subdue, And put to flight all vice beside? Clear is your breast from worldly pride? Of wrath and dread of dying clear? Do you at dreams and conj'rer sneer? Mock wonders, witches, nightly elves? And ev'n Thessalian charms themselves? When heav'n another birth-day sends Art grateful? do you spare your friends? At the approach of hoary age, Art more good-natur'd and more sage? Why pluck one thorn from out your mind And leave so many more behind? If you no more your life pursue With skill, make room for them that do. You've play'd, and eat, and drank, your share, 'Tis time your journey to prepare; Lest youth, that has more decent claim To every kind of wanton game, Shou'd, midst your cups o'ercharg'd, with scoff Hiss your last scene, and drive you off. HORACE HIS ART OF POETRY. Inscribed to the House of Piso. If any painter shou'd design A human visage, and subjoin A horse's neck with plumage swoln, And limbs from various creatures stol'n, Untill the figure, in th'event, Which for a beauteous dame was meant, At length most scandalously ends In a black fish's tail—my friends! Admitted to so strange a sight, Wou'd not your laughter be outright? Believe me, Pisos, that a book Will just like such a picture look, Whose matter, like a sick man's dreams, Is form'd of vanities and whims; Where such absurdities prevail, You can make out nor head nor tail; The painters and the bards, 'tis true, Claim licence as of both their due. 'Tis a concession that I make, And hence excuse we give and take: But not so largely as to coop The tame and savage in a groupe, And snakes with turtle-doves to mate, And lambs with tigers copulate. In pompous proems, big with threat, The usual pattern that is set, Is that they place to make one stare, A piece of patchwork full of glare. As when the fane and sacred wood Of Dian, or meand'ring flood, In pleasant fields, or copious flow Of rhine, or many-colour'd bow, Are all describ'd—but in this case The foppish trump'ry had no place. Perhaps a cypress you can draw— But does that signify a straw, If he that buys what you perform, Was to be made as in a storm. The potter had a jar begun; Why nothing but a pipkin done? In short, the subject what it will, Be simple and consistent still. Most of us—(I the sire address, And each good son the sire express) Are dup'd by things that seem aright: I wou'd be brief with all my might, And so become as dark as night! He nerves and spirit must neglect, Who strives to be extreme correct; He's apt to swell, who wou'd be grand, And he that dreads to leave the strand, In terror of the fierce profound, Is sure to run his ship aground: And he that works a simple theme, I cannot help thinking, but in this and sundry passages, at the beginning of this epistle, there are tacit sneers at Ovid's Metamorphoses, that Horace might at once please Augustus, and gratify (not improbably) a small degree of poetical jealousy.With monster, prodigy and dream, Will paint the dolphin in the lawn, While boars are upon ocean drawn; A scape from error leads to vice, If your discernment be not nice. A sculptor near The Statuaries had their work-shops near the fencing school, that they might be at hand to take the attitudes of the Gladiators. th'Emilian school, Can skill to fashion with his tool The nails, or flowing of the hair, But not compleat the whole affair. If I had any thing to write I wou'd no more be such a wight, Than I wou'd chuse black hair and eyes, With nose of most portentous size. Your plan, whene'er you tune your lay, Suit to your faculties, and weigh How much they can or cannot bear; He who selects his theme with care Will find no want of flowing style, With clean arrangement all the while. But, if the thing I rightly trace, This is the merit and the grace Of disposition, that the bard To time and place have just regard, And mention what shou'd first be known, But other things a while postpone. The true professor of the muse Shou'd know to take and to refuse; Yet if new words he intersperse, He shou'd be cautious in his verse, And choice—It is exceeding well To give a common word the spell, To greet you as intirely new— It is a point you must persue, In modern language to confirm Each strange and philosophic term, Words you may use, to ancient Rome Unknown, yet modestly presume. But new-coin'd words will ever be Of more approv'd authority, If from the Grecian fount they fall, And their mutation be but small, For why shou'd Rome Cæcilius give, And Plautus a prerogative, Which they to Virgil still deny, And Varius?—Why may not ev'n I Make some improvements if I can, Nor suffer from th'invidious clan, Since Ennius and Cato's phrase Their native tongue enrich and raise, And terms exotic introduce— All have, and must allow the use To make a word, that cleanly chimes, Stampt with th'impression of the times. As when the leaves each fleeting year Are chang'd—the earliest dis-appear The first; our words in likewise fare, The oldest perish, as it were, And those new-coin'd are now in flow'r, Like youths, in all their strength and pow'r. Ev'n both must fail our works and we; Whether the Three grand works are here mention'd for the honour of Augustus. The Julian port at Baia, the draining of the Pomplinas palades, and the cleansing of the channel of the Tiber. sovereign of the sea, Receiv'd far up into the land, (A work with royal grandeur plann'd) Our fleet from the North wind defends, Or if a fertile tract extends, Feeds neighbouring cities, feels the plough, A lake and row'd upon but now— Or tho' the river's made by force Of Cæsar's word to change his course, And noxious to his former place Must learn to run a better race— Yet these as human acts must fail; Then how much less shall we prevail To keep the elegance and weight Of language, in a settl'd state. Words shall revive that now are gone, And some, which most are look'd upon, Shall perish, if dame fashion will, Who has in her dominion still Supreme prescriptive pow'r to teach All written and colloquial speech. Homer has taught us in what verse The deeds of kings we shou'd rehearse; And heroes and contentions dire, With what propriety and fire! In numbers of unequal lines, Were wrote at first the lover's whines, But in a while were carried high'r For bliss and fortunate desire. But he who thought it worth his while To sing first in so Ovid again tacitly ridiculed for his elegies. small a style, Our critics have not yet found out, So still the matter is in doubt. Archilochus his wrathful heat Made him strike out th'iambic feet: The sock and stately buskin chose This measure as the nearest prose, Whence dialogue might aptly please, And clamours of the mob appease, Expressive or of mirth or rage, Fit for the bus'ness of the stage. The muse has giv'n us on the lyre In praise divinely to aspire, To sing of Gods and sons of Gods, And champions crown'd against the odds; The winning steed and lover's care, And gen'rous claret to declare. If I'm unskilful to combine The parts and colours I design, Why am I hail'd, where'er I go, As poet, since I nothing know: Why falsely bashful be a fool Rather than go again to school? A comic subject will not hold If 'tis in tragic measure told: Besides, it wou'd an audience shock, In verses fitter for the sock, The Thyestean feast to tell: Each kind of writing shall do well, According to its proper place, Arrang'd in seemliness and grace.— But sometimes comedy will rage, And angry Chremes shake the stage; And sometimes in the tragic scene You've wailings melancholy-mean. Peleus and Telephus when poor, And exiles will no more endure Their rants and ravings ten feet high, If they wou'd to the heart apply. A poem cannot be compleat, Tho' beautiful, if 'tis not sweet, Till by its pathos it can seize The soul, and bear her where it please. Expressive or of joy or pain, As human aspects smile again Upon the smilers, so their eyes Will with the tearful sympathise. If you wou'd have me really weep Your own distresses must be deep, Then, Telephus, your tragic part, Or, Peleus, truly wound my heart. But if you miserably spout Your words, I sleep or else laugh out. Things of a melancholy turn Shou'd be express'd with much concern; But if in wrath the person fret, The aspect shou'd be big with threat. In jest the looks shou'd pleasant be, But serious in severity. For first there is a sense innate To every colour of our fate, Which causes passion, gives relief, Or weighs us to the ground with grief, Till to the tongue the task's assign'd To blaze the motions of the mind. If what the characters shall say Be foreign to the part they play, The Roman knights, and all the croud Will titter and explode aloud. It is a diff'rent matter quite Shou'd Davus speak, or errant knight, A grey old man approach the scene, Or hot young rake, whose years are green, A matron full of pomp and show, Or nurse officious to and fro', A merchant wont thro' seas to roam, Or one who tills his ground at home, Assyrian, Colchan, Theban bred Or Argive on the stage shou'd tread? If e'er you write or follow fame, Or at such sort of stories aim, As with themselves do best agree— Homer's Achilles shall we see? Courageous, enemy to sloth, And most inexorably wroth, Let him, denying human laws, Claim all things by the sword he draws. If e'er Medea fill the scene Fierce and ungovern'd be the queen. Be Ino cast to make you cry, Ixion of perfidious die, Io be rambling drawn and mad, Orestes most severely sad. If to the stage you shall approach With matter you're the first to broach, —Let the new character you cast, Be fairly kept up to the last. 'Tis arduous common things to say In such a clean peculiar way, Untill they fairly seem your own, Wherefore more prudence will be shewn To plan the Iliad out in acts, Than your inventive pow'rs to tax, The first to speak upon the stage Things known not to a former age. A tale however blown upon Will, as your property, come on, If you shall not on trifles dwell, How and about it all to tell, Nor be so faithfully absurd As to translate it word for word, Nor must you squeeze into a streight While you too closely imitate, From whence you can't so well recede For shame, and for the plan agreed, Nor yet begin in tumid sounds, Like that old songster of the rounds, “The fate of Priam, sing I shall “And many a noble bout withal. What will the boaster bring about With all this mowthing and this rout? The mountain shall again be laid, The little mouse again display'd. How much more to the purpose he, The pattern of propriety— “To me the man, O Muse! relate, “Which after Troy's determin'd fate, “By toil and actual review “The nations and their manners knew.” He does not meditate by trash, To give you smoke from out a flash, But chooses rather to procure Illumination from th'obscure. By striking out such strokes with ease, That Scylla and Antiphates And Cyclops and Charybdis please. Nor will from Meleager's fate Returning Diomedes date. Nor dates the Trojan war “to wit “When Leda first began Upon the eggs that brought forth Castor and Pollux. to sit,” But ever hastens to the goal, And throws the reader's very soul Into the center of th'affair, As tho' he'd been an actor there. But chuses certain things to leave Unfit his polish to receive, And with so much discretion lies, Blends truth and falshood in such wise, That the beginning, middle, end, Do cleanly each on each depend. Now hear what all the town with me From you that write expect to see, If you wou'd have th'applauder stay, Attending till the actors say, “Kind gentlemen, pray clap your hands,” Mark how with every man it stands For manners at a certain age; And the decorum of the stage Must be kept up with things assign'd To time of life and turn of mind; The boy who just can prattle plain, And on the ground his tread sustain, Loves with his play-fellows to 'bide, And wrath contracts or lays aside For nothing, changing every hour— The youth out of his guardian's pow'r Delights in horses and in hounds, And o'er the sunny champaign bounds, Pliant as wax to vicious ways, And harsh at what th'adviser says; A slow provider for the best, And spendthrift with a lofty crest, Hot in pursuit of new amours, And quick to leave what he procures. From this by shifting of the plan The age and spirit of the man, Seeks wealth and friendships and a name, And dreads an action to his shame. Sundry infirmities are found Which man in his old-age surround, Because he scrapes and yet abstains, A wretch, that dreads to use his gains; Or else because he acts when old, All things too cautious and too cold, Fain wou'd put off the evil day And greedy in this world to stay; Harsh, querelous, and loud of tongue In praising things when he was young, Censor and punisher too free Of all who're not so old as he. Our growing years, when we are strong, Bring great advantages along, And when we're going down the hill We're more and more the losers still. Then lest the parts that are of age, Shou'd be assign'd to youthful rage, Or those of youth be giv'n to years, The strict propriety adheres Upon those qualities to dwell, Which suit respective ages well. A scene we on the stage behold, Or else we hear the story told; But things which enter at the ear Will not affect the mind so near As what before the eyes is shewn, And each spectator makes his own. But yet you must not things disclose Which done within we best suppose. Some things from sight you'll take away, Which clean description may display; Nor let Medea's hand destroy Before the gaping crowd, her boy; Nor wicked Atreus, full in view, A dish of human entrails stew Or Cadmus turn by change absurd A snake, or Progne be a bird. When thus your scenes you represent Disgust forbids me to assent.— Let not a play you'd have us read, And put upon the stock, exceed Five acts—nor let a god be there, Unless some intricate affair Make you divine assistance seek, Nor a fourth person strain to speak. The chorus shou'd support with art The duty of his manly part, Nor let him sing amidst the acts Ought forc'd or foreign to the facts. Let him the men of worth defend, And give good council to each friend, Restrain the wroth, to them that hate Offences, be affectionate. Let mod'rate fare have his applause And wholesome justice and the laws, And gen'ral peace, that loves to deal In open ports—let him conceal Things spoke in confidence, and pray The Gods, that their propitious day, May to th'unfortunate return, While haughty loftiness they spurn. To flute was not at such a pass Of yore, as to be girt with brass, Till vying with the trump it roars, But small and simple with few bores, To help the chorus with its touch, And fill the rows not throng'd too much: While they cou'd the spectators hold In numbers easy to be told, Chaste, frugal, and not over-bold. But when victorious Rome began On all sides to extend her plan, And when an ampler wall embrac'd The city, and the god of taste Was serv'd with festal wine by day, With none the practice to gain-say, New measures and more notes they found Alike for poetry and sound, For what degree of taste refin'd Cou'd be in an unletter'd hind, Loos'd with his oxen from the yoke, And mix'd with the politer folk. Where low-liv'd miscreants and base, With men of honour took their place? Thus did the master's skill impart, New movements to the ancient art, With all the luxury of air, And strutting like a pompous play'r, Drew on the stage amongst the rest, A train deep-flowing from his vest: Thus likewise did the sober lyre, Up to new strings and strains aspire, And an unusual flow of rage, Rush'd all at once upon the stage; So what they did of old design, For things both useful and divine, Is so far wrested from the mark, That 'tis oracularly dark. The bard (a filthy goat the prize) Who first began to tragedize, Brought on the fawns, a naked race, Still joking with a serious face; Because spectators full of wine, And wild and tir'd with things divine, Requir'd by novelty and show, Their minds shou'd relaxation know; But laughing satyrs we commend. Provided they do not offend, By turning earnest into jest, So that a god, or king, that's drest In gold and purple, do not bawl The language of the cobler's stall, Nor while they shun the groveling mire, To mists and emptiness aspire. Grave tragedy shou'd still disdain All verses in a trivial strain, And, tho' midst wanton satyrs plac'd, Will yet with decency be grac'd, Like some grave matron whom the priest Commands to dance upon a feast. As satirist I do not praise The bald, unornamented phrase, And common cant, nor shall I try To break the rules of tragedy, So as to make no odds between A Davus talking in the scene, Or Pythias putting to the worse Th'old hunks, and making of a purse, Or Liber's guardian wont to wait Upon his pupil god, in state. So wou'd I make a tale my own, Tho' taken from a thing well known, That any man might think to do The same, but when he once set to Wou'd sweat and vex himself in vain, And never to the point attain. So much effect is in the art, Of clean disposing every part, And so much novelty and grace, In common topics, may take place. The wood-land fawns shou'd have a care, (If one may judge in this affair) Lest they shou'd speak as born in town, And ev'n like them that wear the gown; Or lest too much they be inclin'd To verses of infantine kind, Or ev'n be too grosly free With ignominious ribaldry: For every man of rank, or sense, Or family, will take offence; Nor things that with the mob go down, Will such hands or excuse or crown. When a long syllable is join'd Unto a short, and plac'd behind, The quick iambic foot we frame, Whence trimeter deriv'd its name; With only six iambic feet, Consisting of itself compleat: But to the ear not long ago, That it might come more grave and slow, The sober spondee was took in, As to a league and of akin, But not to quit the second place, Or fourth, or last, in any case. However this is very scarce, In Accius's applauded farce, And in the verses Ennius wrote— All bungling lines, like theirs, when brought Upon the stage, with heavy weight, Convict them as precipitate, And wanting care—or, what is worse, Most grosly ignorant of verse. It is not every judge can see The negligence of harmony, And Roman bards in this abuse, Have met with far too much excuse: But shall a man for this discharge, All method, and trangress at large? Or shall I not suppose the more, The world with all my faults explore, Nor shall my spirit be so poor As merely pardon to procure; For tho' I 'scape all brand and blame, I cannot therefore merit fame. The Grecian patterns ye that write, Peruse by day, peruse by night; But spite of these, our sires thought fit To praise the verses and the wit Of Plautus (fools I will not say) But far too patient at his play: That is, if either you or I Have comprehension to descry, True repartee from coarser jeers, And have our fingers and our ears. Thespis the first (they say) found out The tragedy, and bore about His poems in theatric cart, Which all his actors got by heart, And play'd in faces daub'd with lees: Then Escalus too, by degrees, Invented masque and decent pall, And made a little stage withal, Learnt them to aggrandise their talk And in the tragic buskin stalk. To these, with no small share of praise, Th'old comedy in after days Succeeded, but its free excess Forc'd pow'r such licence to suppress; Accordingly a law was fram'd, And when the right, the Chorus claim'd, Of personal abuse, was o'er, He wholly to his shame forbore. Our poets have not left a part Untried, in all their various art, Nor do they least applause deserve, Who from the Grecian models swerve, And our domestic facts rehearse, In tragic or in comic verse; Nor wou'd our Latium more excel In feats of arms, than writing well, Did not her poets in their stile, Disgust the toilsome, tedious file. Do you, my noble friends, reject All poetry for its defect, Which many a blot, and many days Have not chastis'd to perfect phrase. Because Democritus contends, That Genius sorry art transcends; And bars from Helicon each wight, That has his understanding right, The greater number of our herd, Nor pare their nails, nor shave their beard, But walk alone in secret paths, And keep away from public baths, And he shall get the name and prize, Of all poetic mysteries, Whose head beyond all hopes of cure, Will not the barber's touch endure. O how unfortunate am I, Which in the spring to drugs apply! No man shou'd write a finer style, But since that's scarcely worth one's while, I'll do the duty of an hone, And give an edge, tho' I have none. I will (not writing of a line) The office of a bard define, Whence his materials he may gain, How form, and how improve his vein, What graces, and what must offend, Where excellence and error tend. In taste and wisdom to excel Is the main spring of writing well, And subjects you may best explore, Deduc'd from the Socratic lore; And when you once have plan'd the scheme, The words will come with ease extream. The writer, who the duty knows, Which he his friends and country owes, And how he may endear the best, A father, brother, or a guest, By what behaviour he may grace A senator's or Prætor's place, Or how his character sustain, When sent to make the great campaign, Such skill as his compleatly suits Each person with just attributes. The learned copyist shou'd look At life and manners, as a book, And from the language most in use, His style and dialogue deduce. Sometimes a play, that shines at starts, With moral matter for good hearts, Tho' without music, weight or ease, Will more the Roman people please, And better on their mem'ry dwells, Than tuneful toys, and senseless bells. The Muse has Greece with genius crown'd, They turn the rolling periods round, Nor can such spirit and such fire, Ought equal to applause desire. The Roman youths with pain and pride A pound divide and subdivide, “If from five ounces you take one, “How much remains, my little son,” —One third part of a pound.—” O rare! “You'll for yourself take special care— “An ounce is added—what's the whole? Why half a pound—this rust of soul And hankering after wealth ingrim'd, The verse harmonious and well-tim'd, Can we expect from sordid elves With cedar ting'd on cypress shelves? If poets use their talents right, 'Tis to instruct or to delight, And in the moral page to plan, The pleasures and concerns of man. Whate'er you teach be brief and plain, That they conceive you and retain. When masters make too much a rout, O'ercharg'd instructions will flow out. Each fancy-piece for pleasure feign'd, Shou'd near the truth be still sustain'd, Nor let your tale at any hand, Exaction of belief demand, Nor from the witch's belly rive, The boy she din'd upon alive. The tribe of seniors will decry All verse in which no fruit they spy; And the young noblemen will sneer, And slight all writings too austere; He wins most votes and makes most friends, That use and entertainment blends, At once delighting all that read, And urging them to take good heed. This book brings money to the trade, By this the longest voyage is made, And its fam'd author must procure A long memorial to endure. But there are failings of the muse We shou'd be ready to excuse; Nor in the strings we always find, Sounds answering to the hand and mind; For oftentimes they will not suit, And sound a grave for an acute. The archer's bow, tho' aim'd aright, Will not for ever hit the white. But verses shining in the main I'll not for a few faults disdain, Which either from a want of heed, Or human frailty may proceed, What therefore shall we hence deduce? As a transcriber wants excuse, If oft he err, tho' oft forewarn'd, And as a harper's justly scorn'd, By whom one note is always marr'd, So each incorrigible bard Becomes a Chærilus to me; In whom if three good lines I see I smile and wonder—but am wroth, At Homer's slumbers and his sloth; But 'tis allowable, perhaps, If in long works the author naps. With painting poetry agrees, And some things will the rather please, If nearly view'd—but you'll be took With others at a distant look. That loves the dark, this will endure The light, nor dread the connoisseur. This piece has pleas'd, one time explor'd, But this ten thousand times encor'd. O youth! the elder of the two, Tho' from your father you persue The right, and of yourself are wise, Yet hear the thing that I advise, Respecting life in many a scene, The tolerable and the mean We bear; a lawyer in his room, Or pleader, who cannot presume With great Messala's worth to vie, Nor can be seen with Aulus by, Yet still may be in some request— But with regard to bards profest, Nor Gods nor men nor rubric post, Can bear them when they're middlemost. As musick at an handsome treat, If bad, will all the joy defeat; And essence thick, where poppies blend With This honey was bitter, from the nature of the herbs in that country. Sardian honey-comb, offend; Because these things might have been spar'd, So verse, to sooth the soul, prepar'd; If short of true perfection found, They lose all worth, and sink aground. He that cannot the weapons play, Will from the ring keep far away, And one unskill'd in quoit or troque, Forbear, lest he the laugh provoke Of gaping crowds, at his expence— But poets all our fools commence.— Why not! the gentleman is free, Of such estate and family, Is rated at th'equestrian fine, And has no sinister design. But The elder Piso. thou shalt nothing say or do, Save what Minerva prompts you to; Such is your judgement, such your will, But if you ere assume the quill, Let Metius your production see, Who is a judge—your sire—and me.— Nine years your verses be suppress'd, For while you're of your work possess'd, You still may blot th'unpublish'd strain, Which gone, you will recal in vain. Orpheus, the God's own seer and priest, Wild mortals from th'inhuman feast, And savage ways deterr'd, from thence Inferr'd, upon a fair pretence, Tygers to tame and lions fell. Amphion, by his tuneful shell, Was said to build the Theban wall With stones that heard the charmer's call. It was the wisdom of their song Of old, to sever right and wrong, The public weal from private gain, And things religious from profane; Promiscuous Venus to abate, And institute the marriage state; Towns and communities to plan, And write the laws of God and Man. 'Twas thus an honour and a name, On bards divine, and verses came. To worthies as sublime as these, Succeeded great Mæonides: Tyrtæus too, by pow'r of verse, To make the combatants more fierce. In verse the oracles are made, Th'œconomy of life display'd; And by the soft Pierian strain, The royal favour we obtain; For these were giv'n th'Olymphic bay, And sports to sooth the toilsome day. Hear this lest you in scorn refuse Sweet Phœbus, and the tuneful muse. It is a question they contest, If nature or if art be best, To form the bard—I do not see, What without parts mere industry Can profit,—nor can I devise How unform'd Genius shou'd suffice. Thus one requires the other still, And friendly mingles force and skill. Whoe'er attempts with all his soul, To run so as to reach the goal, Has from a child endur'd much pain, From wine and women must abstain, And sweat and freeze, and sweat again. The man that hymns the Pythian God, Was once at school and fear'd the rod: Nor will it hold for one to cry, “My wond'rous verse is very high, “A murrain seize the hindmost bard, “'Tis shame if ought my course retard, “Or that I shou'd be forc'd to own, “That what's untaught to me's unknown!” As auctioneers with voice aloud, To buy their goods collect a crowd; Thus bards with money and with land, Will hire an assentatious band; But if 'tis one that can afford To deck with elegance his board; Or any of the poor to bail, And save from law-suits, and a jail. I wonder if he yet can know, A friend distinguish'd from a foe; For making or intent to make, A gift of ought for friendship's sake, Do not lead forth the honour'd boy, To read your verse while big with joy: For then he certainly will roar, O rare, O bravo, and encore! Pale at some parts, at some he'll weep, At some he'll jump about and leap: As those that wail a corpse for pelf Do more than real grief itself, By word and deed—so friends that jeer, Out-act the candid and sincere. Kings certain men are said to ply, With frequent cups their strength to try, That they may see into their heart, If it can act a friendly part. Thus, when the verse you make and show; Learn caution from the fox and crow. Quintilius, if to him you read Your poems, with great frankness said; “Pray alter this and that review:” Which if you urg'd you cou'd not do, Endeav'ring sundry times in vain, He'd bid you blot it out again, And to the anvil yet restore, Bald verses to be hammer'd o'er. If you chose rather to defend Your fault, than own it and amend, He wou'd not waste another word On one resolv'd to be absurd, But rivalless you might admire Yourself, and your poetic fire. A good man judging as he ought, Will censure numbers void of thought, Condemn the harsh, nor will be brook The incorrect, but cross the book: Ambitious ornaments he'll pare, And to th'obscure give light and air; Ambiguous diction he will spurn, Mark what shou'd have another turn: In short, he will to thine and thee, Another Aristarchus be— Nor will he say, “I'll not offend, “In trivial matters any friend” Such trifles sometimes cause offence, And are of serious consequence, To one expos'd and ill-receiv'd, Thro' folly not to be retriev'd. As one thro' phrenzy wild and vague, Whom scurvy and King's evil plague, Dreading his touch, each man that's wise, From the mad-headed poet flies; The boys attack him in the street; Some follow, who are less discreet. He, while he roves about to cant His verses with extatic rant, If like a fowler while he eyes, Intent upon the bird that flies, Into some ditch or well shou'd fall, Tho' for a long time he might bawl, “Help, O my Countrymen!” not one To take him out, an inch wou'd run. But shou'd some man his help afford, And fairly let him down a cord, I wou'd object, “how can you prove, “This person chuses to remove!” And then to make the matter clear, I'd quote the fam'd Sicilian seer, Empedocles, what time he schem'd, Ev'n as a god to be esteem'd; And in cold fit too fond of fame, Leapt into Etna's burning flame. Then let these men of great renown, Have privilege to hang or drown, For such as save them 'gainst their will, Are next akin to those, that kill. And often has he thus behav'd, Nor, shou'd he by mere force be sav'd, Wou'd he (as man) his lot abide, And scorn the shame of suicide. Nor is the principle yet known, Why he shou'd try at verse alone; Whether he did of old presume, To stale upon his father's tomb, Or 'ere remov'd with black intent, The vengeful thunder's monument. He's mad, howe'er, by all the fates, And like a bear that's broke the grates, Learn'd and unlearn'd, as he recites, He chaces bitterly and frights, But those he overtakes at last, With tooth and tongue he holds right fast, And sticks unto them, like a leach, Till glutted in all parts of speech.
