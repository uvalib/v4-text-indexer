      <field name="fulltext">âAll Poets dream, and some do nothing more. When you have turned these pages o'er, You then may tell me, if you please, Which I resemble most of these.â Walter Savage Landor, TO ROBERT WILLIAM KENNARD, ESQ. THE AUTHOR DEDICATES THIS VOLUME OF LYRICS, SEEKING THEREBY TO INDICATE, HOWEVER POORLY AND INEFFICIENTLY, HIS HEARTFELT RESPECT AND ESTEEM. âLook out no longer for extensive woods, For clusters of unlopt and lofty trees, With stately animals coucht under them, Or grottoes with deep wells of water pure, And ancient figures in the solid rock: Come, with our sunny pasture be content, Our narrow garden and our homestead croft, And tillage not neglected.â Walter Savage Landor. THE BURDEN OF THE BELL. On his journey Youth doth start, Strong of limb and stout of heart; And he thinketh Life must be An unbroken jubilee. He doth find full proof of this In the summer's frolic bliss,â And from roughest winter weather Strong conviction he doth gather; While the World, with ample store Of its fair, false-smiling lore, Doth convince him more and more. So he singethââOh that thou, Merry Life, wouldst last for ever! Oh, that strength were given me now To enchain Time's rushing river,â Bind it fast from shore to shore, For evermoreâfor evermore!â Let the bell toll! Manhood, with an eager eye Lit with passioned ecstasy, Sitteth at the banquet board With Life's richest dainties stored. Viands, exquisite and rare, Wines, bright sparkling past compare, Pomp and splendourâall are there; And around that board are seen Radiant face and lovely mien; There are smiles that make the light Sunnier in its own despite; There are voices that pour round Music in soft waves of sound: And from all this syren pleasure Manhood reapeth his full measure,â Tasteth each new luxury, Draineth oft the wine-cup dry; And the while his spirit owns Witchery in Love's dulcet tones, And the while he boldly sips Burning kisses from ripe lips, He doth inly murmur,âstill Shutting out each thought of ill As aforetimeââOh, that thou Merry Life, wouldst last for ever! Oh, that strength were given me now To enchain Time's rushing river,â Bind it fast from shore to shore, For evermoreâfor evermore!â Let the bell toll! Manhood,âthe hath left the feast, In a feverish unrest:â With pale cheek and sunken eye, He doth wander moodily In the meadow paths and through The brown corn-sheaves, wet with dew. Moodily he wandereth there; For a thought of drear despair Doth possess himâhe doth see That Life's joy is vanity: He doth see that over all Syren pleasure's festiveal There is spread the burial pall;â That amid the glittering rout Spectral terrors flit about;â Ruin in the revelry, After-shriekings in the glee, Poison in the wine,âand death In proud beauty's perfumed breath: He doth see the doom, the snare, But the aid, the refugeâwhere? So, he museth mournfully Under the sweet summer sky, In the orchard crofts and through The brown corn-sheaves wet with dew. And, albeit the bird doth sing Like a very blessÃ«d thing, And the flowers do all declare âEarth is very good and fairââ Not a single smile doth roll Back the cloud-veil from his soul; And his lips, compressed and pale, Ope but with a muttered wail,â Heedless of that song of yore That such constant burden bore, âFor evermoreâfor evermore!â Let the bells chime! On the hill-top, worn and grey, Lieth Age:âa pleasant ray From the setting sun doth grace The deep furrows of his face. God be blessÃ«d! he hath won Life's great victoryâwending on, Through the dreamings proud and bold, Through the passions manifold, Through the subtle hopes and fears Of the stormy later years, To the Truth, that in his soul Holdeth now its high control, Guiding onward to the goal. God be blessÃ«d! he doth lie On the hill-top neath the sky; And no earth-mists intervene Betwixt him and the blue serene, Shining soft in starry sheen. âGod be blessÃ«d!â he doth say, With a loving smile alway,â âThat Life lasteth not for everâ That no mortal strength can stay The swift tide of Time's dark river! It doth bear me fast away From the dolour and the sting Of the present suffering, Onward to the joy divine And the rest that shall be mine!ââ âAnd sweet voices seem to sing, Sounding from some far-off shore, For evermoreâfor evermore!â Let the bells chime! MY STATUES. ADDRESSED TO W. BRAILSFORD, ESQ. I dwell amongst a silent people here, O distant Friend! No sound of human cheer Gladdens my fireside:âthough the flashing light Falls upon faces, young and spirit-bright, Deep eyes and rounded cheeks and parted lips That smile upon me through the dim eclipse Of the brown shadows. Here, a nymph peers out, Timid, as scared by some mid-forest shout: There, from 'neath thunderous brows, with solemn stress, A god glares at me from his far recess,â Or childhood, clasping flowers that cannot fade, Makes its own sunshine in the deepest shade. âAnd we commune in silence, they and I, My Statues:âquestion soft and soft reply Pass voicelessly; and from the windy weather, Or the great calmâconversing thus togetherâ From day or night, from clear or clouded skies, We take the key-note of our colloquies. The breeze blows freshly:ââSea-nymph! sea nymph! thon, White Galatea, with the starry brow, On the seaward rocks that standest, beautiful, Say, sleeps the ocean;âis the moon at full?â Then, on my dreaming fancy falls a low, Soft singing murmur, like a rivulet's flow; âQueen Dian shines not; seek her by the pillow, Of her love on Latmosâtempest rocks the billow.â âSing, Galatea!ââand she sings her old, Sad Acis storyâne'er too often told,â None sweeter:âsings it wondrous plaintively Like a swan's melody, if such there be, Till the wind drowns the eadence: Then I cry, âHo! Hero, Hero! lift thy torch on high, Higher and higher, lest thy sea-boy die!â Wailing the answer comes,âa wail of death: âMy Torch is quenchedâmy life is quenchedââshe saith; âAlone, beneath the stars, aloneâaione!â And the cleft water swallows up the moan. Shake the worn casements, falls the flooding rain:â âTitan! rock-climber! the fierce surges gain On thy retreating steps; thy loved one dies, Clasping her little one, that feebly cries For thy strong succour:âone more effort, lo! Yon crag remains to scale,âthe last; below, Ruin awaits thee;âup! the toil defy! Titan! rock-climber! is there hope on high?â âNo hope, no refuge!âDeath!ââthe sole reply, So we commune, my Friend, while winter rolls Its storms and sorrows over hearths and souls. But other converse ours when winds and rains Are over and goneâand through the through the throbbing veins Of the sweet Nature courses her warm blood, And she puts off her weeds of widowhood, And decks the new fresh beauty she hath won, And braids her shining tresses in the sun. Trim buskin'd, slim of form, with eager air, (She stands half-hidden by the curtain, there) A nymph, with loose locks floating on the breeze, Swift courser of the hill-tops,â'neath the trees Blythe hunterâbeckons me, as she would say âCome forth, O loiterer! hence, away, away! Earth wooes us,âheav'n invokes us,âall the air Thrills with a summons: forth! our place is there!â And I go forth, compassed with phantasy, And wander with her where the Oreads be In the hill-hollows; or we join the rout Of the satyrs 'midst the vinesâand drink and shout Loud as the loudest there; or chase the deer, O'er broad savannahs with uplifted spear, And through cool gleaming rivers. There, full oft A voice arrests meâtender voice and soft; Hylas, fair struggler, close and closer prest By white arms intertwined, to glowing breast And lipes love-burning,âHylas that, I wis, Doubteth if wise it be against such bliss To wrestle, and so pleading with a smile,â âLoose me! oh loose me!ââclingeth all the while To his young captors. And I, standing there, Watch the smooth syrens slowly downward bearâ Down through the lilies shining in still grace, Down, through the clear wave closing without traceâ Their prize, now passive in their fond embrace. And I am left alone,âalone! Not so: On sweep the ages in their mystic flowâ And classic fable, absolute no more, Yields to new story and a later lore. âSweet household creature, that dost sit demure On the green river-bank, with bare-feet, pure As the pure water that so lovingly Doth kiss and kiss them as it creepeth by, Loth to leave kissing! Little snow-drop, thou From old Cervantes gardenâthat shalt live In the fair form, art-given, thou wearest now Till beauty cease to charm or art survive,â Sweet Dorothea! tell me o'er again That story of thy love and all its pain.â âAh yes! I know it well, fair child, but I Am never weary of the history: So, let the water have its wayward will And the pert zephyr flutter round thee still, While thou and I, like gossips staunch and true, Run through the chapter of the past anew.â Thereon, she straight reveals those secrecies, Just as doves coo such tales 'mid leafy trees, Fearing strange listeners: and more slowly still, Creeps that sly water, eddying,âwhile his fill Pert zephyr drinketh of the music rare, Soul-music, that he deemeth past compare. Shall I go on, and show you more of these My fire-side guestsâmy household sanctities? Ah no, âEnough!â you say:âand truly, Friend, My silent folk grow garrulous. An end Must needs be made, ere sagely you conclude This hermit cell of mine no solitude, But a rank Babel. So, in fine, take this My frank confession:â'midst them all I miss Old voices and old faces, such as brought Warmth to my heart and freshness to my thought In the dear time departed. I would give All Galatea's singingâay, and strive To hoard no memory of the sweet despair Of Hero's passionâto see sitting there, Just face to face with me, in cheery guise, A real, live gossip:âto your charities, See, I appeal, my Friend: comeâand I'll make My silences thrice silent for your sake. Brussels. ECHO. âWhat a silence!â say youâwait awhile Till the folding hills encircle us, And the rock-chasms yawn in grim defile; Then we'll rouse up Echo, shouting thusâ Echo, Echo, Echo, Pan is coming! Pan, with all his horns and hunters coming! Wake up, Echo, wake up swift from slumber! And sweet Echo, half in joy, half fear, At such olden, but o'er hasty greeting, Quick from hill to hill the tale will bear, Quick through cave and chasm our cry repeating, Echo, Echo, Echo, Pan is coming! Pan with all his horns and hunters coming! Wake up, Echo, wake up swift from slumber! Pan! strange name to ntter 'mid the glory Of truth's sunshine, in this later day, But poor Echo, born of heathen story, Loves such salutation best, they say; Shout then, Echo, Echo, Pan is coming! Pan, with all his horns and hunters coming! Wake up, Echo, wake up swift from slumber! THE POETS FLOWER-GATHERING. âFrom the Pleasance, Poet mine, Fetch me flowers!â the Lady saidâ âFlowers whereon the moonbeams shine, And the night's first dews are shed.â Then the Poet, slowly, slowly Through the Pleasance takes his way, (In the dream that wraps him wholly, Murmuring low some sylvan lay), To the beds of bloom, that woo him With their blended odours rare,â Richest odours, wafted to him On the calm night air. And he saithââO Rose, I claim thee For a virgin flower more fair,â For a bosom that shall shame thee Into dying there.â But from that pale Rose proceeding, Silver-sweet was heard the pleading, âPoet, spare, oh spare! Spare me, earliest of my race, I am queen of this still place, And a star doth love me;â Lift thy gaze from earth to sky,â Poet, lo! unchangeably It doth smile above me. And if thou hadst passed this way, Gentle face, by light of day, Not a breath of perfumed air Would have 'scaped from out me;â Bloom and fragrance both I store Till the weary day is o'er, And the twilight, dusky-fair, Drops her folds about me: But when, one by one, the flowers Sink to sleep around me; And from out its azure bowers You sweet light hath found me, With glad heart I offer up, All the incense in my cup, And the winds together, At my bidding, on their wings, With Ãolian whisperings Waft it up the ether: And be sure that loving smile Groweth brighter yet the while. âPoet, with that musing eye, Look into this heart of mine; Where the pearlÃ«d dew-drops lie, There the star-rays strike and shine; Poet, they came down, came down, Love-sent, from their native heavenâ Gifts are they for homage shown, And for fragrance given; And each ray that flasheth free Tells a tale of joy for me. Spare me, spare me, for the sake, Poet, of thine own heart's pleasure, And that love of thine shall take Blessings with it beyond measure: Spare me, spare me!â And the Poet Through the Pleasance takes his wayâ With raised browâthe lips below it, Shaped into a âWell-a-day! Not one rose for thee!â Then smiling, Saith he, with soft voice beguiling, âLily, lily, thou must bend thee From thy stately heightâ Thou must pity and befriend me In my task to-night!â A low murmur stirred the air, But the cry was stillââOh, spare!â âHearken, hearken!ââand the singing Voice that from the lily wells, Soundeth like the breezy ringing, On a sabbath morn up-springing, Of faint village bells; Soundeth like the tones that waken When the light winds sweep the sern And the melodies are shaken From the hare-bell's urn. âHearken,â saith she, âPoet, hearken, Ere thou steal my joy away, Ere my fair new life thou darken With a swift decay. BlessÃ«d, blessÃ«d is the glory Of the golden-crownÃ«d light, But for me a sweeter story Hath the dewy face of night; For when all the pleasance lonely Groweth, and beneath the trees The white moonbeams, trooping only, Work their silent fantasies, Oft from out the greenwood shadow Comes an elfin sprite to me, Tripping gaily o'er the meadow, Singing ever merrily; With a tiny shout of greeting, Low he sinks on bended knee, Smiling still, and still repeating, âLily, ope thine heart to me!â Then with sudden gesture sprightly, Close my slender stem is pressed,â With a bound he leapeth lightly To his place of rest:â And all night, all night he singeth Elfin songs that sweetest be, Till the soft air round us ringeth With his merry minstrelsy. He doth sing of sunny places, Far away, Where a constant ealm embraces Night and day. Where the rivers as they wander, Where the winds, young leaves that sunnder, Where the very cataract's thunder Tell of love alway. And he saith the blossoms growing There do neither faint nor fade, Dowered with fragrance ever flowing, Be it shine or shade; And that spirits bright and fair Hold it ever their best duty Each young bud to cherish there, And unfold its beauty. Never cruel hand, I wis, Dareth pluck or break themâ Angel touch, or angel kiss,â Worse doth ne'er o'ertake them. And that little fay hath vow'd He will surely bear me From this land of mist and cloud, Ere the storm-blast tear me, To that refuge far away, That calm home of brightnessâ There to live and bloom for aye, In eternal whiteness. Nayâthis very night, it may be, He will keep that vowâ Poet, by thine own sweet lady, Hear and heed me now! Heed me!ââAh, she ceaseth pleadingâ Down the alleys green, Fast the Poet's form receding Faint and dim is seen.â âNeither Rose, alas! nor Lily, For thy crown, my queen!â But the Violet, close-hidden 'Midst its leaves he spies; And quick stoopethâunforbidden, To possess his prize? Nay, not soâsharp accents sudden Of wild anguish rise; And again he needs must tarry By that flow'ret pale, While the scented air doth carry To his ear her tale. Of the ruin and the sadness That such doom would leaveâ Of the glory and the gladness That are his to give. Woe is me! the tale is over, But the moonlight doth discover That no prize is won; That our puzzled Poet-lover Roameth flowerless onâ âNo, not even a Violet, lady, Well-a-day, not one!â And each blossom that hath station, In that Pleasance fair, Still doth meet his invocation With its separate prayerâ With sweet words of deprecation, And that cryââOh, spare!â So he wandereth, ever vainlyâ Wandereth hour by hour, Till Love's duty pointeth plainly To his lady's bower. And he entereth, somewhat weary, Ay, and suppliantly, With a murmured âMiserere!â Breathed on bended kneeâ âMiserere! O my lady, Not one flower for thee!â Then, encompassed by the glory Of his art, with kindling air, He doth weave each flower's sweet story Into poems rare; And the pure and calm cmotion Of his strain commingleth so With the moonlight and the motion Of the sighing leaves below, That you well might deem some spirit From an elemental sphere, That no earth-stain doth inherit, Sang his deseant there. With fond ear the lady listenethâ With a face of rapt repose, And her eye's deep azure glisteneth When the lay doth close. And she murmureth, âPoet mine, From my pleasance thou hast brought Blossoms of a hue divine, With immortal fragrance fraught; Blossoms dearer far to me Than earth's brightest ones can be, And a worthy crownâfor thee!â A LITTLE STAVE TO MY SINGING BIRD, THE CHILD ELLIE. Ellie, come and live with meâ Thou my singing bird shalt be; Little sunny bird of beauty, Thou shalt perch upon my knee. Bravest Blackbird, Ellie dear, Shall confess thee without peer; Best Canary, gay and golden, Shall grow sick at heart to hear. And the Nightingale shall say, From the lime-bough o'er the way, Sing on, Ellie, singâI'm weary Of my own sad strain to day.â Gay as bees in beds of thyme, We'll enjoy each changing timeâ Morning's freshness, mist enwoven. Noontide's crowned and blessÃ«d prime. And when eve's grey shadows come And all other birds are dumb, Ellie, thou shalt sing thy sweetest, Thou shalt fill with glee my home. Home for winter, that's to sayâ But when Summer trips this way, With her blue eyes full of pleasures, Thou shalt be my woodland fay. Out in the air, out in the air! Through the sloping meadows fair;â Who shall guess, O playmate Ellie, Half our merry mischief there? And each song thou then dost sing Shall its fitting guerdon bring;â Oh! the wild wood strawberries, Past all child imagining, For their sweetness!âand the brown Hazle nuts, that drop adown From full ripeness, 'mid the mosses, Under hedge rows, overgrown By tall brambles, climbing still Out of reach, with cunning skill, Crowned at top with blackest berriesâ These shall all be thine at will. Judge what feasts we'll have, my bird, In the green-wood, undeterred By the fear of any gazer, All our happy laughter heard By the wood-folk onlyâby Heares upstarting timidly, Squirrel, frisking bold above us, Or some sage old owl, that sly From his nest doth peep, full fain To discover and make plain, What the sound is that is neither Sound of wind, nor sound of rain. Ay, and then in turning back, Homeward, in our winding track, Oh! the posies that we'll gatherâ Rose, thyme, meadow-sweet, good lack! Honeyâsuckle blooms run wild, White may blossoms, undefiledâ Crowns of gold for queens' pale foreheads! Crowns of flowers for thine, my child! See, I tempt thee, Ellieâsay, Wilt thou be my woodland fay, And my singing bird of beauty?â Ah! I dare thee to say nay! Wilt thou love me well, and come To make gladness in my home?â In my home and heart, O Ellie, Where all other birds are dumb? Draw nearâlet me smooth away Those wild tresses . . . welladay! What a task to catch thee, mischief! Sunbeams, in the woods at play, Are caught soonerânow peer out, Rosy face, and solve my doubtâ Peer out through the soft brown shadows That enwrap thee round about. Loving eyes, my woodland fayâ Open brow, as frank as day, Lips, with . . . Kisses for sole answersâ Ah! I dared thee to say nay! Sing, then, Ellie! joy alone Sound in each uplifted tone!â While to wish thee best of blessings, May God bless thee, little one! THE POET AND HIS VOCATION. âSelf-contentedly approve you Unto Him who sits above you, In hope, that apprehends An end beyond these ends, And great uses rendered duly By the meanest song sung truly!â Elizabeth Barrett Browning. O Poet, should I wish thee Such crowns as the world shapes, with smiling lips For brows like thine? At noonday, when eelipse Blots out the sun in heaven, men gaze and say, âGreat blessing art thou, Sun! until thy ray Ceased thus untimely, certes, little thought Was ours of all the glory thou hast brought To this our earth. Great blessing art thou, Sun; Great praise and worship hast thou nobly won!â Wait, Poet, wait Till Death doth keep his state In thy still chambers, and upon thine eyes His fixed immutable shadow deeply lies,â Wait, till thou hearest afar The seraph-anthem floating from God's heaven, Borne on from star to starâ When life hath faded from thee like a dream, And all the gauds of life the vilest seem, Shall those world-crowns be given. But, Poet, I would give thee No scorn for such as these,âno lifting high Of a proud forehead. Meekly, patiently, Sing thou thy songs along the world's highways, Putting not from thee any meed of praise That grudging hands dole out: high task is thine; High recompense, if worthily and well, Thy lays, with upward aspiration, swell The soul's brave utterance of the truth divine;â High task, if only one poor human heart Be raised, and cheered, and strengthened by thine art; High recompense, if not a voice be found I' the world to bless theeâangels catch the sound Of the eternal truth on earthly ground, And there is joy in heaven. Then Poet, I would bid thee Thus nobly work, content, for present gain, That all the beautiful of earth's domain Is thy great heritage:âthat unto thee A grander music soundeth from the sea,â A richer fragrance in the flower is shrined,â A softer murmur borne upon the wind,â Than greeteth the world's senseâthat all are fraught With revelations to thy quickening thought; With solemn whispers of mysterious things, With stately fancies, fine imaginings:â And more, O Christian Poet! that all these Are but faint types and transient images Of an unfading beauty, that shall be Thine ever, through a glad eternity, When the world's toil is o'er. Work on, work on; Tarry not, rest not, till the crown is won Which suiteth living brows,âthe holy crown, That, with its deathless, shadowless renown, O Poet, I would wish thee! THE BROOK AND THE SYCAMORE. âShade me, oh! shade me!ââthe streamlet said To the tall and stately Sycamore; âOver my bosom thy branches spread, Till the fiery noontide heat is o'er, And I'll promise you a guerdon meet For such true service, friendly tree; A guerdon, simple, but passing sweetâ Bend lowâI'll whisper what it shall be; I'll sing you a song, I'll sing you a song, That shall fill the silence all night long; A song, whose music shall seem to you As the fanning wind and the dropping dew; A song that shall hush you to slumber deep, Then weave its witchery through your sleep; That shall bathe as with freshness of early showers Each leaf o'ertasked by the sunny hours; That shall win all wandering odours up From purple bell and from golden cup, To float and languish your boughs amongâ All this, I'll promise you in my song, All this and more, O Sycamore, For your shade till the noontide heat is o'er.â Then the Sycamore broad his leaves unfurled O'er the little stream, For pride hath no place in Nature's world, As in ours, I deem. No place at allâon the giant height Of the royal mountain, gay and bright Grow the little flowers, no whit afraid; And the mountain, in his storms arrayed, Shelters and shields them as best he can From the avalanche and the hurricane. Pride! mark the idle zephyrs play With the monarch oak's fresh budding spray; Frolicking, flutt'ring, round leaf and stemâ And the oak, no scorn hath he for them, But frolicking, fluttering too, I wis, Giveth whisper for whisper and kiss for kiss. Pride! wateh the stream on its way to ocean Gliding along with a merry motion, How it gurgles and eddies, in pure delight, Round the cup-lily's blossoms, broad and white, But a little further, perchance you'll see Its current laving as lovingly The poor little daisy, meekest of all, That peeping forth from its grassy thrall, Bends down its small sweet face to see What it is that murmurs so tenderly. Pride! on man only that curse is hurledâ There is no such thing in Nature's world! So the Sycamore deigned, though stately and tall, To shield from the sunbeams, one and all The stream at its foot, till the noontide's reign Was ended, and over wood and plain The cool eve-shadows fell soft again. And the little brook, as wood-folks tell, Its plighted promise fulfilled so well, That at dawn, when the season of dreams was past, Of all the trees in that forest vast The Sycamore woke from sleep the last. Woke with a sigh too, that clearly meant A feeling of inward discontent At the change, from wonder and witchery, From honey-dew, odours and harmony, To the common earth and the common sky. And I've heard the learned in leafy lore Declare of all sounds in the Sycamore, That this is their burden and this their strainâ âSing me, oh sing me that song again!â EFFIE'S SECRET. In her tiring room she sat, Saucy Effie! In an olden chair of state, Carven fineâmore meet, pardie! For her grandame's majesty, Than for Effie. Robe and band were laid aside, And her brown hair floated wide O'er her shoulders, that were seen Snowy-white its waves between. And those self-same wavelets too Hid the sunny brow from view; But the little face peeped through, Rosy-fresh, and very fair, Of an elfin beauty rare, Lit with smiles as lilies are, When the sunshine from their chalice drinketh up the dew. Had the sunshine found her there, Saucy Effie? Cloudy sky and heavy air Were night's stormy harbingers,â But heart-sunshine, that was hers, Joyous Effie! You might see it gleaming up From that merry heart's full cup; Gleaming up, and brimming o'er In rich sparkles evermore, Till the little face grew bright With excess of inner lightâ Deeper tints the cheek displayed, Archer smiles the lips arrayed, And the dark eyes flashed their splendour through the drooping tresses' shade. In her hand she held a flower, Saucy Effieâ Relic of some by-gone hour, Shrunk and withered, sere and brown, All its whilome fairness flown, Foolish Effie!â From her bosom's seereey She with drew it stealthily, And her silver laugh rang clear:â âLittle wots he thou art here, Snowdrop of the long ago, Treasured up and cherished so,â And, good sooth! he ne'er shall know!ââ Then the brow was lifted high In a mimic royalty, Very brief; for soon she pressed That poor withered bosom-guest To her pitying lips, I wis. Whereupon, a sudden flush Wrapped her beauty, blush on blush, Like the mantling of the morning at the sun's first kiss. And a name she murmured oft, Foolish Effie! Murmured low and murmured soft, With a music like the bee's, Full of honeyed flatteriesâ Loving Effie! Or like that the streamlet weaves, Rippling, in calm summer eves, Round the water-lily's leaves. And because she spoke so low, All the silence seemed to grow Deeper, that no tone might be Lost of that sweet harmony. So, the name was heard full clear, Uttered now in frolic glee, Now in earnest verity, And with fond reiteration, as of lover lief and dear. And she dreamed not, smiling sly, Simple Effie! That perchance some bird was nighâ That a little bird o' the air Might be hovering round her there, Foolish Effie! Swift to hear and swift to tell All her story passing well: All the love dissembled so, Burning bright beneath the snow,â All the tender fancies, worn Softly 'neath a mask of scorn:â That, in short, this bird might bear All her secret full and fair, In its flittings to and fro, To that one who âne'er should know:ââ Not a thought of all this ruin had she, sitting lonely there! Not a thought! But, well-a-day! Hapless Effie! When the morning light shone gray, Through the greenwood far away Roamed a youth, with visage gay; And he laughed a merry laughter, and the greenwood heard him sayâ âMock me now the livelong day, Mistress Effie! Frown and fume as best you mayâ Nathless, let what will befall, I shall see you still through all, Loving Effie! Mock my flowersâmy wild-wood posies, Hedge-row violets and white rosesâ Eyes averted, coldly shun them,â Little foot, tread proudly on them, Spurning such?âah! yes, I knowâ But anear thy heart also, âTreasured up and cherished so, Snowdrop of the long ago!â Mock me with your gibes and jeers, Sounding strange in other ears That believe thee void of guile, And that hear thee not thee while, As I hear thee, murmur oft Murmur low and murmur soft, Other words, that back recall Those hard jestings one and all. Other wordsâay, pr'ythee, still, If it please thee, mock thy fill: Mock me with thy lofty graces, And thy pitying grimaces, And the smiles on other faces; Mock me with all signs that tell Of a scorn unspeakable: But, despite thy fancied thrall,â Though all this and worse befall, By that little withered token And that name so fondly spoken, I shall know thee loving Effie,âI shall see the love through all!â DOOM. A DREAM OF THE BROCKEN. âLate, late yestreen, I saw the new moon, With the old moon in her arms; And I fear, I fear, my master dear, We shall have a deadly storm.â Ballad of Sir Patrick Spence. The North Wind summoned his legions all, At the dead midnight, from their dungeon thrall; And he said with a shout, that as it rose, Stripped bare the forests and shook the snows,â âAway, to your work of ruin!â Fierce and fellâfierce and fell, Over rock and over dell,â Through the tossing Norway pines, Through the wreaths of southern vines,â Fierce and fellâfierce and fell, Passed they with a savage yell, As for earth's undoing. And the Raven, that sits on the blasted bough, He hath flapped his wing and followed, I trow. There's a crag on the Brocken, the topmost of all, That standeth solemn, and black, and tall, With a jagged top, where the moon-rays fall Sudden and sharpâyou may see it shine Far down in the vale, at the day's decline. And circling around it, round and round, Eddy the winds, with a muffled sound, As of wierd witch-laughter, stealthy and low; And ever, as round and round they go, There's a flapping of wings on the dead pine-boughâ A flapping of wings, and a voice doth callâ âCrag of the Brocken, Crag of the Brocken, Stoop to thy fall!â Then silence awhileânot a sound replies, But the moon looks out from the darkened skies, And still in its grandeur, stately and tall, Towereth the Brocken-Crag, topmost of all. But louder and louder the laughter grows, And fiercer the strength of the viewless foes; The loose rocks spin in the air, the trees Groan 'neath the stress of their agonies,â And again, through the tumult, is heard, I trow, That flapping of wings on the dead pine-bough, Again, hoarse and sullen, that boding callâ âCrag of the Brocken, Crag of the Brocken, Stoop to thy fall!â And the peasant, far down in the vale below, Looks forth from his casement in terror, and lo! By the fitful moonbeams, that come and go, He seeth the Brocken-Crag sway to and fro, Then dash down the rocks with a headlong rout, While still in its track doth that wild voice shout Hoarser, and louder, and high over all, âCrag of the Brocken, Crag of the Brocken, Haste to thy fall!â Fierce and freeâfierce and free, Over land and over sea, To their work of ruinâ Through the valleys, still and deep, Where the nestling hamlets sleep,â Through the cities, wide and fair, Working wreek and ravage there,â Fierce and freeâfierce and free, Passed they, with a savage glee, As for earth's undoing. And the Raven that sits on the blasted bough, He hath whetted his beak and followed, I trow. The Lord Baron he sits in the northern tower, In his old grey tower, aloneâ With a frowning brow, and a cruel eye, And he laugheth loudââSir Guy, Sir Guy, My will must unbend, or this tower descend, Ere thou comest to claim thine own! Ha, ha! 'twas a fair young bride,â quoth he, âThat smiled in my face, and knelt at my knee, But I drove them forth together,â I drove them forth from my sight, pardie, With a bitter curse, for all company To brighten the mad weather!â And the Baron, he strideth up and down, With a sterner smile, and a darker frown, But he stoppeth ere long, for a sudden knell, Falls on his ear, like a passing bell, That tolleth solemnly.â And anon, through the sound of the lashing rain, There's a flapping of wings at the lattice pane,â A flapping of wings, and, piercing and high, With scream of ill omen, a voice doth cry, âLord Baron, Lord Baron, that passing bell Tolleth for thee!â Dread looks the Baron, and white of ble, But he looseth the casement full manfully, And he looketh forthâlo! the moon on high Glares through the clouds, as they hurry by, With a ghastly face, as of witchery.â Lo! the boughs of the forest trees, one and all, Toss, like black plumes at a funeral; And circling the battlements, round and round, He hears the winds eddy with boding sound, An angry murmur, that groweth ere long, Moment by moment, more wild and strong, Till that grim old tower, so mossy and grey, Trembles and rocks 'neath their hurricane sway. Still, the Baron he paceth up and down, And his brow is knit with the same black frown, And back to his face hath crept, the while, The baleful light of that cruel smile,â Ah me, ah me! He seeth perchance the knight, Sir Guy, And the bride, that he loveth so tenderly, Wandering, wandering, sad and forlorn, Heart-broken, shelterless, weary and worn, And the smile groweth brighter!âhe seeth them flee, O'er the dark hills, followed relentlessly By the tempest that rageth with evil will, And the curse, that o'ertaketh them, fleeter still, And fiercely he laugheth!âbut hark, the knell Soundeth anew, as of passing bell That tolleth solemnly;â And anew, in the pause of the beating rain, Comes the flapping of wings at the lattice pane,â The flapping of wings, and from out the gloom, Freezing his life-blood, that voice of doom, âLord Baron, Lord Baron, you passing bell Tolleth for thee!â Down, down, down! With a roar, and a crash, and a mocking cry From the whirling winds, and piercing through all, A scream, as of mortal agony, That grim old tower, so mossy and grey, That hath braved for ages the battle fray, Doth shake and totter and fallâ Down, down! Massive and vast, to the fosse below, It sinketh in ruinâeach mighty stone, From basement to battlement overthrown; But thrice, ere the terrible strife is o'er, Is heard, I wot, 'mid the general roar, That shrieking voice of woe,â And thrice, as in triumph, a weird-like sound, As of hoarse wild laughter, echoeth round, While faint in the distance, floatcth the knell Of a solemn deep-toned funeral bell.â Ave Maria! guard us well! FLOWER DIRGES. Sing ye dirges for the flowers? Nay,âtheir prime is past and gone; Fed with sunshine and sweet showers, They have graced the summer hours,â Now, their work is done: From the uplands, fierce and strong, Bitter blasts will blow ere longâ Happy they, seeure of shelter From wild winter's wrong! They have left us, undismayed By the change that did befall; Wearied out with shine and shade, It rejoiced them, one and all, To escape from daylight's ken To their chambers subterrain,â There to rest awhile, and then Weave their summer robes again, Weave them fresh, and weave them fair, And their fragrant spells prepare:â Therefore, sing no mournful dirges, for these flowers, O men! But, if ye must sing, sad-hearted, Thus, your withered joys among, Wail ye for the hopes departed Since the year was young.â For the hopes that, bright and glowing, Sprang beside the rivers flowing Through the land of thought erewhile,â Sprang, soul-nurtured, and grew lovely In Faith's halcyon smile, Till the world's breath reached them:âslowly Then ye felt their beauty wane; One by one, they vanished wholly Into Death's domain,â Fading, not, like Earth's pale blossoms, Soon perchance to bloom again. For high hopes, then, lowly lying,â Meek hopes, once so fair to see,â Loving hopes, all coldly dying,â Heavenward hopesâah, me! Sing ye dirges, deep in sadness, for these flowers, O men! THE SONG OF THE IVY. âHa, ha!â laughed the Ivyââlet poets sing Of the oak, and erown him the forest king: Let them sing of the elm, for his lordly height, And the birch, for his bark so smooth and white, Let them praise the chesnut, for majesty, And the willow, for beautyâbut what care I? Beauteous, and stately, and strong, and tall,â I conquer them allâI conquer them all!â âHa, ha!â laughed the Ivyââlet men uprear Castles and palaces far and near; Pile upon pile let their fabrics rise, Darkening the earth and mocking the skies, Lifting their turrets so haughtily, Boasting their grandeurâbut what care I? Buttress, and bastion, and topmost wallâ I conquer them allâI conquer them all!â âHa, ha!â laughed the Ivyââold Time to me Hath given the glory and mastery: So poets may sing, if it like them well, From early matins till vesper bell; And others may list to their minstrelsy,â I've a song of my own, so(^) what care I? Beauteous, and stately, and strong, and tall,â I conquer them allâI conquer them all!â ALICE. The nun looks forth through the convent pane, Woe is me, Alice! But the snow lies deep on the frozen ground, This way and that she looketh roundâ In vain, in vain! Woe is me, Alice! The night shades creep o'er the frozen ground,â She looketh stillâno voice, no sound; Woe is me, Alice! In the convent dell a young page lieth; Woe is me, Alice! A young page lieth, faint and low, And his life blood staineth the virgin snow, As alone, he dieth. Woe is me, Alice! The night shades creep o'er the frozen ground, Where he lieth still,âno voice, no soundâ Woe is me, Alice! The nuns look forth through the convent pane, Woe is me, Alice! And they smile to see the fair spring rise From the winter's thrall, and the evening skies Shine soft again;â Woe is me, Alice! There's a young form stretched on bier meanwhile, There's a young face weareth the corpse's smile, And the solemn night shades creep around Where she lieth still,âno voice, no sound, Woe is me, Alice! LOVE HER STILL. Love her still! She hath fallen very lowâ Thou who knew'st her long ago, Little, little canst thou see Of her girlhood's purity; But, though sin hath left its trace On her once sweet happy face, And that innocent maiden brow Droopeth in dark shadow nowâ Though life's glory all hath fled, And life's shame is her's instead, Love her still! Love her! let no harsh cold word, Man, from lips of thine be heard; Woman, with no lifted eye Mock thou her deep agony; Weep ye,âtears, give tears along. To our world-forsaken oneâ Love her still! Love her-let her feel your love. Summer showers that fall above Fainting blossoms, leave with them Freshened leaf and straightened stem; Sunshine oft doth give again Bloom the bitter storm hath ta'en; And this human love of ours, To the world's poor faded flowers, May be found as dear a boon As God's blessÃ«d rain and sun To restore their native hue, And their native fragrance too;â Love her still! Gather round her, weep and prayâ Clasp her, lead her from the way She doth journeyâtenderly From the wrong and misery, To the better paths, where peace Waiteth her, with sweet release From life's heart-ache;âso, once more In her breast the hope of yore May be lit, that holy hope, That with earthly loss doth cope, Earthly sin and earthly shame, Till all earth is but a name, And the rescued soul is given, With its treasure, unto heaven! Oh, bethink ye of the bliss That will fill your hearts for this, Loving friends, what time ye see Shadow after shadow flee From her pale sad face;âwhat time, Soaring in a thought sublime, Ye shall know, the while ye pray, To his angels God doth say, âLove her still!â A CATASTROPHE IN AN ACORN CUP. âHo, ho!â quoth the Fairiesââhere's a cup Of dew that the Sun has clean forgot, In his midsummer madness, to drink upâ Let us quaff to his worshipful health!âwhy not? To the Sun's bright health! and.. ahem!âmay he Show ever the same short memory!â So they sipped and they quaffed, till the cup was dryâ That the nectar was strong you may well rely, For the wood soon rang with their revelry,â And quaint were the mirth and the melody Of the songs they poured on the midnight breeze, As they waltzed round hillocks and old oak trees. But lo! in the midst of their maddest dance,â Poor merrymen all!âa sudden trance O'ertook them, a torpor, whose drowsy might Weighed their eyelids down in their own despiteâ Hushed grew their voices, and heavy and slow Moved the little feet so brisk e'en now, And, heedless of nighteaps and toilet graces, In all sorts of postures, and all sorts of places, They yielded, at last, each failing sense To that torpor's tyrannical influence. One fell asleep with his head in the cup He had just been draining,âone curled up His leaden limbs in a cranny, where A spider, a sort of Giant Despair, Tied him fast with a web through his golden hair;â And one,âworst luck of all,âslipped over A high bank into a furzy cover, Terribly ragged and rough and lonely, Where he tore, I fear,..not his jerkin only. But neither thorns, nor spiders, nor aught That is most abhorrent to elfin thought, Had power at that moment, to loose the yoke Of the spell that bound those fairy folk;â So they slept and slept with a right good will, And the morning found them sleeping still. âAha!â said the Sun, when, called to rise, He got out of bed with winking eyes, And, while his curtain of mist he furled, Looked down from his window on the world;â âAha! They are caught in my trap, I seeâ These moon-lovging spritesâhenceforth they'll be Somewhat less ready to touch, I'm thinking, The dew that is meant for my private drinking. 'Twas a wise thought, that of mine, to pray My gossip, the wind, that yesterday Set out on a journey round that way, To drop from his pinion as he flew, In that acorn-cup brimfull of dew, Two great white poppy seeds, ripe and rare And of wondrous virtue to ensnare Poachers and pilferers such as theyâ Aha! there'll be dew enough to day!â And there was dewâlight laughed the sun, As he drained the flower-cups, one by one,â Meadow-sweet, foxglove and mountain bell, Primrose and cowslip and pimpernel, All of them beaded and brimming o'er;â Dew there was, truly, an ample store, And the next day too, and for many more. But whether, from that time forth, made wise By the cramps and stitches and maladies, That seized them in waking, the cunning elves Foreswore dew-drinking and bound themselves With a âtemperance pledge,â in the usual wayâ I can't inform you .. perhaps they may! AN IMAGE. Sounds of music in the palace, Festal lute and lyre, Swelling in a sudden triumph Higher still, and higher; Sounds of dancers in their gladness, Bounding through the hall; Sounds of sweet young singing voices, While through all, through all, Steals the tinkling silvery music Of the fountain's fall. But that voice of exultation Soon doth faint and die: Riseth now a cry of mourning, And fierce agony. O'er the mirth, and o'er the revel, Sinks the funeral pall, And the funeral bell is tolling, But through all, through all, Steals the tinkling silvery music Of the fountain's fall. So, within the palace chambers Of full many a heart, One thought oftentimes doth linger And will not depart. Grief may moan or sadness languish, Or bright joy befall, That one thought is interwoven Still through all, through all, Like the tinkling silvery music Of the fountain's fall. THERE! Yes, thou art there, Hated one, loathÃ«d one! 'Twas a brave blow, Crushing the sneer on thy lips, and thy brow With its bland mockery! Friend, thou art now Lyingâwell know I the spotâthe soft light Basks on the quiet wave, sunny and bright, But deep down below,âfull ten fathoms and more, Is a grim jagged rock, and its shadow falls o'er A pool, black and slimy, the horrible lair Of monsters so loathly, no mortal could bear To behold them, unmaddenedâand friend, thou art there! Thou art there, with no light save the light of thy smileâ Save the light of the sneer on thy white face the while, Which death hath given back to thee. Fast to the shore, When that brave blow was struck, I departedâmy oar Clove the calm waters, that sparkled with glee, But were sullen and dull when I passed there with thee; And the moon, through the silver clouds, peered from her throne, And smiled to behold me returningâalone. I walked in the world with a bold, upright brow; I was free. Who should daunt me? No creature save thou! So I rode on the sward, and I danced in the hallâ I wooed man's belovÃ«d, whomâGod's love befall! And the crafty ones greeted me smoothly the while, And their stately fair daughters spake soft with a smile: I was freeâthrough the street, the piazza, the square, I passed, and I repassed, andâthou wert not there! But friend, shall I whisper a truth in thine ear! Aha! there's no change in that icy cold sneerâ Still writhing and curling! Sweet friend, I can guess, There'll be joy in its bitterness, when I confess That not finding thee in street, piazza, or square, My wierd thought crossed the water to visit thee, where Deep down in the darkness, ten fathoms and more, The grim jagged rock, in its horrow, leans o'er The pool, black and slimyâeach hour of the day, And the dream-haunted night, that wierd thought went its way On its terrible errand unresting, full fain By the light of its dread, to behold thee again; And it saw thee! Saw! good Saints! for ever and aye It seeth thee, just as thou wert that bright day, When the doom overtook theeâthe same glassy eye That glared on me with a mute curse for reply; And the thin lips that strove all their venom to pour, And grinned, when Fate sealed them, and mocked me the more; And all the fierce washing of seas in their flow Hath failed to erase the blood stains from thy brow! But to-day, I remember me, friend, I must stand At the altar, troth-plighted, to win the white hand Of the bride I have chosenâto clasp it in mineâ In mine . . in this hand!âhow her beauty would pine, And her joys drop away from her, scathed by despair, Could she read the red history God seeth there! What shrieks through the gray minster aisles would be ringing, To stop the priest's prayer, and the choristers' singing! Hark, her voice! She doth seek meâ'twas strange, but last night I dreamed that I roamed with her 'neath the moon's light On the sands of the beachâand anon, that my oar Was cleaving the water, far out from the shore. On, on! the wind howledâthough no cloud could be seen In the sky, and the sweet stars were shining serene. On, on! the wind ceasedânot a sound stirred the air, And my heart died within meâI felt we were ..there! And there, fate-encompassed, methought I drew near To my bride, and with shuddering lips, in her ear Breathed the truth in its blacknessâwhen sudden, a cry Of horror and agony went up on high To the gate of God's heaven!âa plash in the seaâ A young ghostly face, that glared upward at me, Who sat, palsy-strickenâa low bubbling groan, And thou,âay, thou sawest me, left there .. alone. For I looked o'er the boat-side, and clear to my sight Grew the water-depthsâgleams of a strange lurid light Came and went, and I saw the sea-sprites holding out Their long arms to clasp me, a wild fiendish rout; But down deeper, deeper, the huge rock uprose, And just then, those strange flashes sufficed to disclose In the gloom of its shadow, all ghastly and grim, The pool, the black poolâI looked over its brim, And lo! for a moment revealed to my view, I saw twoâI saw two! And the death from thy rigid fixed features had fled, And the eyes that met mine burned with fierce joy instead, And thine armâhow my soul in its torment made moan!â Thine arm, round my lost one, in triumph was thrown! This white plumeâI'll wear it to-dayâ'twill proclaim How clear my soul's record, how spotless my fame; And these flowers, they will whisperâtrue prophets are flowersâ Of the sunshine and happiness that must be ours. And the Curse! O false mocker, ere long thou shalt see How I'll bury it deep in that black pool with thee! CITY-CRAFT, AND SOUL-CRAFT. âGood bye to Flattery's fawning face, To Grandeur with his wise grimace, To upstart Wealth's averted eye, Tu supple Office, low and high, Good bye, proud World, I'm going home.â Ralph Waldo Emerson. From the city's ceaseless clangour, From its guile and strife and anger, From the turbid stormy rushing of the eternal life-stream there, Forth I've stolen, without warning, Sick at heart this sunny morning, Such existence loathing, scorning, For the harvest it doth bear;â Dead-sea apples, dead-sea apples, such the fruit that it doth bearâ Pluck them, ye who love such fare! Pluck them, grey-beards, dull and solemn, Climbing slow the figured column,â Blind St. Simeons, from its summit, blinking down on men and things, Grasp the prize of all your toiling, All your scheming, fencing, foiling, Three-score dusty years' turmoilingâ Grasp the guerdon that Fate brings! Dust and ashes, dust and ashes! this the guerdon that she brings! Hoard them, ye who crave such things! Hoard them! till Death heaps upon you Gibes, your cunning craft hath won youâ Till the angels weep, close-folded in the shade of silver wings; Weep to mark the final ruin Crown at last the long misdoingâ Weep to see your souls pursuing Paths, where Terror sits and sings;â âNo returning, no returning!ââSo the ancient Terror singsâ This your guerdon that Fate brings. Thinking thus, this autumn morning, Wilful truant, without warning Forth I've stolen, minded truly to retrace my steps no more; Distant now the city's noises, Hushed its discords and harsh voices, And a calmer hope rejoices In my bosom, as of yore;â Oh! calm hopes and simple pleasures! Oh! the blessÃ«d days of yore! I will win ye back once more. Dew of heaven, the pure, the holy, Bathe my brow and cleanse it wholly From the soil the gold-lust leavethâfrom the pallor it doth shed; Air of heaven, blow freshly o'er me, Cleave the mist unfurled before me, Spirit-mist that veils the glory And the beauty, round me spread;â Cleave it thou too, heaven's own sunshine, smiling very soft o'er head;â On my soul that smile be shed! Here I close and clasp for ever The great tome of world's endeavour,â Ugly tome! all blotted over, first to last, with fraud and wrong;â Soul's endeavour, upward rising, Struggling, toiling, agonizing For a bliss beyond all prizing, This my aim be, staunch and strong! Aid me, Nature, nursing mother, make me true and make me strongâ Unto thee such tasks belong. Teach me as thou didst in olden Days, with blossoms blue and golden, With thy songs of winds and waters, and thy silence sweeter still; Teach me with thy graver wonders, Solemn-sounding storms and thunders, Levin-flash, the rock that sunders, Blackness dropt on holt and hill. As a child, O watching mother, 'scaped e'en now from deadly ill, Seek I thee with docile will. In mine ear still sounds the moaning Of world-eraft, a dismal droning,â One sole maxim, mouthed and muttered 'mid a steaming mist of lies; âGather, gather in full measureâ Late and early pile up treasure; Gold is glory, power, pleasureâ Swift Time's busy shuttle flies; Gather, gather!ââthis their maxim, muttered 'neath God's smiling skiesâ Teach me, thou, in other guise! Turn thy tome's clear pages over, All its loving truths discover, Let me read, with spirit lowly, God's eternal meanings there; Till at last, through long probation, I may reach Faith's higher station, Reach a loftier revelation, Its indwelling mercies shareâ Aid me Nature, nursing Mother! aid me, Faith, and aid me, Prayer! Lift me to the rapture there! So when Death unfolds the portal, Of my spirit-life immortal, I may hear no gibes heaped on me, for false gods set up in vain; So no eyes of angels, keeping In high heaven their watch unsleeping, May be dimmed with cloud of weeping For the paths my soul hath ta'en, But instead,ââOh! welcome, welcome!âno more strife and no more pain!â Be it mine to hear that strain! AN INDICTMENT UNDER A HEDGE-ROW. Caught at last, brown Bee! Now confess to me All thou hast been doing, Flirting, flatt'ring, wooing, 'Mongst the foolish flowers, These long summer hours. Tell me all thy sinning, Bee, from the beginning. What! that sulky droning, Like a whipped child's moaningâ Quite tired out, you sayâ Working hard all dayâ Gathering scraps of honey Just to sell for money;â Love indeed! pooh, pooh! Flirting! no, not you! Oh! brown Bee, brown Bee! Truly shames it me That you, folks deem wiser, Should be such a miser. But as I descry In that roguish eye Something, to my view, Not quite fair and true, Call we if you please, Trusty witnesses, To give attestation To your allegation. Here stands one .. aha! Sweet Campanula, May we pin our faith Unto what he saith, This brown Bee, that here Doth in gyves appear? âNo! he gathered honey, But for love, not money; So at least he whispered When his wooing prospered; So he vowed with kisses Warm, and fond caresses,â Calling truth to witness, That each taste of sweetness Was for proving merely How he loved me dearly. So, ah! foolish blossom, From this trusting bosom, I resigned, with pleasure, All my hoarded treasureâ Foolish, for in sooth, It may be the truth, What he now doth plead In his bitter need, That he gleaned his honey Not for love, but money.â Dealt he so with thee, Rose, this wicked Bee? âYes, just so with me!â And with thee, fair dame, Foxglove, red with shame? âAy, the same, the same!â Thyme, with thee, poor weed, Did his arts succeed? âYes, indeed, indeed!â And with thee, no less, Violet, I guess? âI must needs say yes,â Oh! brown Bee, brown Bee! Greatly shocks it me That you are no wiser, Libertine and miserâ Gathering your honey Both for love and money!â Oh! brown Bee, deceiver! Ruiner and leaver! Runagate and rover! False disloyal lover! Glad indeed am I Thou in bonds dost lie, That all flowers may see Thy iniquity, And advised, henceforth, Of thy real worth, May preserve their treasures Safe from thy wild pleasures. Now for doom condign Meet for sin like thine. Our conclusions are, Prisoner at the bar, That, close caged, you stay One long summer dayâ Caged, with, round about you, Thousand flowers to flout youâ Lovely hues to haunt you, Richest scents to taunt you, Taunt you and pursue you, Piercing through and through you, Telling tales of honey Worth a mint of money. Do thou penance thus, Insect Tantalus! And when night falls dreary, Hum thy âMiserereâ Till, constrained to pity, By such doleful ditty, Some small fairy, coming This way through the gloaming, Throwing wide thy door, Set thee free once more. Bee, with due repentance, Bow to this our sentence! THE SEA-MAID'S RING. âDiver, bold diver, what hast thou brought me Up from the sea?â âStarry and golden, a ring, O damsel, I have brought theeâ A ring that fell from a sea-maid's finger, Right fair to see. In the deep sea-caves, damsel, she caught me By my long hairâ âTarry, O diver, tarry and love me!â So sang she there: âLove me, O love me!â but fiercely I mocked her And her soft prayer. Foul scorn, O sea-maid, give I unto thee, Love give I none; Eyes that are darker, smiles that are sweeter, Mine heart have won; On the rocks waiteth me my betroth'd maiden, Earth's fairest one. Straight in my palm her starry ring dropped she With a dark smile; Unwound her snowy arms, gazed at me mutely For a brief while; Then through the coral caves, echoing her laughter, The maid did flee, And with this gift of hers, shedding light round it Wondrous to see, Through the wild water, damsel belovÃ«d, Came I to thee.â On the rocks stood they o'erhanging the billow, Sunset was nigh; Darkly one cloud did float, dimming the splendour Of the sweet sky, And on the maiden's face brooded its shadow All bodingly. In the youth's hand her own placed she full fondly, Yet timidly; Soon on her finger gleamed the small circlet Bright as might be; But when from love's embrace, from its close clasping She was set free, With a weird cry of wild misery leaped she Into the sea! Down through the billow, through the cleft billow, In his despair Swift sank the diver, with straining eyeballs Seeking her there; But alas! never more shall he behold her, That maiden fair. Nevermore, nevermore! life ebbeth from him, Life's hope doth fail, And from the coral caves plainly he heareth A mocking wail, Whereat his heart doth grow fainter within him, His cheek more pale. Terrible fantasies, shifting for ever, His sense beguile; Shapes flit around him in the wild water Loathly and vile, And in his dying eyes glareth the sea-maid, With her dark smile. âSING FOR THE VIOLET!â Sing for the Violet! sweetest of blossoms, Purpling the meadow-banks, pearled with the dew; Or in leaf-labyrinths, or maiden bosoms, Balmy and beautiful, hiding from view. Sing for the Violet, sing for the Violet, Under the shadiness of the green bough! Sing for the Violet! I know its light o 'loveâ Wind of the South, I wot, thou too canst say, For those same leafy beds and purple banks above, Thou hast been loitering this livelong day. Sing for the Violet, sing for the Violet, Under the shadiness of the green bough! I heard a fairy once chaunt a blythe roundelay;â Spruce little manakin, tripping along Through the tall fern-stalks, taking his holydayâ And,âthat's the burden he tacked to his songâ Sing for the Violet, sing for the Violet, Under the shadiness of the green bough! A VISION OF OLD FAMES. âDown the dark future, through long generations, The echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease; And like a bell with solemn sweet vibrations, I hear once more the voice of Christ say, âPeace!ââ Longfellow. I had a vision in the years gone byâ A vision of a vast sepulchral hall, Reared on gigantic columns, black and grim, And lit with torches of undying flame. Around the walls stood pedestals, whereon Were statues numberless, the marble shapes Of warriors, dauntless chieftains, stalwart knights, That in the stormy battle days of old Had won their right to that proud eminence, And stood there crown'd. Majestic shapes, in sooth, Strong-limbed, stern-visaged, and with life-like eyes, That seem'd for ever glaring at gaunt Death With a fierce mockery;âall mighty men, Men of renown were they, foremost in fight, Whose names were blazon'd in the scrolls of fame, For the world's worship. In their hands they held Great swords, or keen-edged axes, and each foot Was planted firmly on its granite base With an immutable will, as who should say, âWe take our stand here till the eternal years Bring us renewal of our glorious prime!â Above them hung old banners, that had waved On many a stricken field, and with brief pause, A trumpet blast reverberate, awoke The hollow echoes of the vaulted aisles, With its victorious clangour;âwhereupon Those banners rustled, waving to and fro As in the rush of battle, and a strange And ghostly murmur seemed to thrill around, As if the marble lips of those dead men Were striving to give utterance anew To their old war-cries. And whenever thus The trumpet sounded, then methought I saw The spaces of the hall on a sudden filled With a dense multitude, all kneeling low, All pouring forth the tide of their hearts' love And reverential homage at the feet Of those crowned kings of war. Musing, I gazed, Compassed with saddest phantasies of thought, Till slowly waned the vision from my sight, Chased by the dawn, and to my waking ear, With the first matin-song of happy birds, Came rumours of great battles won afar, Harvests of slaughter, garner'd in by Death, And honours, by a world's acclaim bestow'd On our victorious generals. Time rolled on, And once again, in dream, I seem'd to stand Within the portals of that hall of Fame. Lo! change was busy thereâchangeâay the grand Calm fixÃ«dness that reigned supreme before Had vanished wholly; in its place was seen, Working its pitiless ravage, fell Decay. Still burnt the torches, though with failing firesâ Still on their pedestals were ranged the shapes, The effigies of those stern men of old. But all the jewels in their crowns were dim, And from the drooping brows of some the crowns Themselves had fallen; phantom-like they looked, An unsnbstantial, ghastly, wan array, Impalpable, unrealâtheir glowing eyes Grown meaningless and void, their stately bulk Shrunken and shadowyâall their grandeur gone, All their proud bearingâscarce their meagre hands Could clutch the deadly symbols of their sway, Their rusted swords and axesâtottering, As if o'ermaster'd by a fate sublime, They stood in act to fall;âand when the trump Broke the drear silence, not as erst it did, In notes of exultation loud and long, But with a feeble melancholy moan, It woke no recognition, and so died Into a silence drearier than before. Wide open stood the portals, but in vainâ No throng of worshippers sought entrance there, No knees were bent, no vows were paid: pale Death And Desolation and Decay alone Stalk'd like avengers through the lone dim aisles. So pass'd the hours, till one by one the flames Of the wasted torches flicker'd and went out, And pitchy darkness hover'd over all. Then suddenly, a mighty thunder peal Shook the huge fabricâthe tall columns rocked, The solid basements trembled, and in the midst, What time the trumpet breathed its final blast, A wail of lamentation and despair,â Most like the cry of a lost spirit's woe,â Down, headlong from their granite pedestals Fell those false idols, while amid the din, Methought I heard a solemn voice proclaim, The voice as of an angel, clear and strong,â âThese shedders of men's blood, for evermore Their glory hath departed:âGod hath said, Even God, the Lord Omnipotent, hath said, There shall be no more war!â Oh blessÃ«d dream! I look through the long vista of the yearsâ I see the forms of the meek men of peace, The men with thoughtful eyes, and broad calm brows, That in their patient lowliness of heart Have been up-lifted to the seats of power, And from that eminence have scatter'd down New light and wider blessings on mankind. I see them wear the crowns of the world's love, Its earnest homage, its enduring faithâ Wear them, not darkly in sepulchral halls, But in the open sunshine, 'neath the smile Of the sweet heaven. I look abroad and sean The rich plains of the populous earth, its vales, Its mighty cities; o'er the seas I look, Lit up with white sails of the merchant ships, And in the length and breadth of the fair world, I see no lingering token of the reign Of the destroyer, War. But to my ear Instead, the burdcn of a solemn hymn Steals, floating upward from the souls of men, Upward and onward still, from star to star, Through all the spaces of the Universe, âThere shall be no more war!ââOh! blessÃ«d dream! A CITY LYRIC. 'Midst the crowd I needs must linger, Aye, and labour day by day, But I send my thoughts to wander, And my fancies far away. In the flesh I'm cloud-encompassed, Through the gloom my path doth lie; In the spirit, by cool waters, Under sunny skies, am I. Do not pity me, my brother, I can see your fountains play; I can see your streams meander, Flashing in the golden ray. And mine ear doth drink your music, Song of birds or rippling leaves, Or the reaper's stave, sung blithely, Mid the ripe brown barley sheaves. I go forth at will, and gather Flowers from gardens trim and fair; Or amongst the shady woodlands, Cull the sweet blooms lurking there. Little wot you, O my brother, While I toil with sweat of brow, Of the leisure that doth wait me 'Neath the far-off forest bough. Little wot you, looking upward At the smoke-wreaths lowering there, That my vision is not bounded By this dull and murky air; That these thick, close streets and alleys At my bidding vanish quite, And the meadows ope before me, And the green hills crowned with light. Do not pity me, my brother, God's dear love to me hath given Comfort mid the strife and turmoil, And some blessings under heaven. In the flesh I'm cloud-encompassed, Through the gloom my footsteps stray, But I send my thoughts to wander, And my fancies far away, And they bring me strength for trial, And sweet solace day by day. THE STRIFE, AND THE REPOSE. Lo, a peasant-child lay sleeping, Dream-bound in the sun, Changes into life were leaping Round him, many a one. There were sounds of village wassail, Borne upon the breeze; ArmÃ«d bands of lord and vassal Swept beneath the trees. There were groans of ire and anguish, Outraged homes among; Vows of vengeance ne'er to languish, Through closed chambers rung. Then came roar and strife of battle, Clash of sword and spear, Rallying-shout and cannon's rattle, Death-cries, dread to hear. Women's eyes were red with weepingâ Freedom's race was run, While that peasant-child lay sleeping, Dream-bound in the sun. And that day a king descended From his place of pride, Straight from throne to dungeon wended, And to doom beside. While a tyrant smote the nation With an evil hand; Rapine, fire, and desolation, Raged at his command. Goodly towns were ta'en and plundered, Stately halls laid low; Loving hearts for ever sundered, Beauty quenched in woe. Morning dawned in smiles and hearkened To glad sounds alone; Evening found the glory darkened, And the gladness gone. So was wassail changed for weeping Empire lost and won, While that peasant-child lay sleeping, Dream-bound in the sun. THE RIPPLE ON THE WATER. There was a ripple on the water's face, A ripple on the water of Loch Fyne; Bright fell the sunshine, with a sportive grace; Sweet sung the throstle from her island shrine. âSave me, Godâsave me!â but a moment past, Uprose the shriek of frenzied agony; From the clear wave, a dying youth aghast Glared round, and upward, as he breath'd that cry, Then sunk, slow-drifting through the unfathom'd space, Down to dark burial, 'mid the wild weed's twine. So came that ripple on the water's face, That ripple on the water of Loch Fyne. THE ONE HOPE. Hope of Wealth, sink low for ever In a life-long sleep; Hope of Love, by Time's dark river No more watch and weep. Hope of Fame, fade slowly, slowly, From thy shatter'd throne. Hope of Heaven, possess me wholly, Until Heaven be won. THE VOICES AT THE THRONE. A little child, A little meek-faced, quiet, village child Sat singing, by her cottage door at eve, A low, sweet, Sabbath song. No human ear Caught the faint melodyâno human eye Beheld the upturned aspect, or the smile That wreathed her innocent lips the while they breathed The oft-repeated burden of the hymn, âPraise God! praise God!â A Seraph by the Throne In the full glory stood. With eager hand, He smote the golden harpstrings, till a flood Of harmony on the celestial air Welled forth, unceasing. Then with a great voice, He sang the âHoly, Holy, evermore, Lord God Almighty!â and the eternal courts Thrilled with the rapture, and the hierarchies, Angel, and rapt archangel, throbbed and burned With vehement adoration. Higher yet Rose the majestic anthem, without pause, Higher, with rich magnificence of sound, To its full strength, and still the infinite heavens Rang with the âHoly, Holy, evermore!â Till trembling from excess of awe and love, Each sceptred spirit sank before the Throne, With a mute hallelujah. But, e'en then, While the ecstatic song was at its height, Stole in an alien voiceâa voice that seemed To float, float upward from some world afarâ A meek and child-like voice, faint, but how sweet! That blended with the seraph's rushing strain, Even as a fountain's music, with the roll Of the reverberate thunder. Loving smiles Lit up the beauty of each angel's face At that new utteranceâsmiles of joy that grew More joyous yet, as ever and anon Was heard the simple burden of the hymn, âPraise God! Praise God!â And when the seraph's song Had reached its close, and o'er the golden lyre Silence hung broodingâwhen the eternal courts Rang but with echoes of his chant sublime, Still, through the abysmal space, that wandering voice Came floating upward from its world afar, Still murmured sweet on the celestial air, âPraise God! Praise God!â EARTH. Earth is very fair! Earth's love clingeth to me! BlessÃ«d angels! ye who share Heaven-loves pure and strong, oh, tear These close earthly ties asunder Ere their clasp undo me! To the valleys, in the glory Of their summer pomp arrayedâ To the giant mountains hoaryâ To the dewy woodland's shadeâ To the calm broad rivers, flowing Through the pastures murmuringlyâ To each grace of earth's bestowing, They have bound me lovingly:â BlessÃ«d angels, blessÃ«d angels, from this bondage set me free! Lo! I stand By the dim and misty margin Of an unknown strand, On the utmost verge of time; And God's great Eternity Seemeth ever fronting me With a solemn face sublime And a solemn beckoning hand: Butâah me! ah, woe is me!â I shrink backward tremblingly; Shrink and cling to life's fruition, From the terrors of that vision, From the unfolding of the portals of the shadowy spirit-land. BlessÃ«d angels! let the shining Of your beauty light the gloom: Aid me, from your heaven inclining, In this hour of strife and doom! Close me round from earth's beguilingâ From her lingering fond embraceâ From her sunny sky's soft smiling, And the pleading in her face! Close me round, and with your singing Into silence awe the crowd Of familiar voices ringing Round me, very clear and loud,â From the meadow-grasses springing, Dropping downward from the cloud. Close me round!âyet stronger groweth This undying love of mine,â Stronger, as life's river floweth Nearer to its fount divine. Strongerâstronger, through all weepingâ Through all prayers poured ceaselesslyâ Through all spirit-toil unsleepingâ Through all depths of agony: Angels!âGod! above the angels!âfrom this bondage set me free! A FLING AT THE BALLAD-MONGERS. Summer's face is set around With a rosy wreath; Rose tints on her damask cheek, Rose scents in her breath! Summer's smiles are very fair, And her deep, soft eyes declare Honeyed meanings, while her voice Saith for aye, âRejoice, rejoice!â So I pour my spirit o'er her And I bend my knee before her, Singing ditties in her honour, Heaping all my praise upon her, Till . . ah, yes, I must avow, When the hour comes she doth bow At the sound of Time's death-knell, I can say, farewell, farewell, With small weeping in my eyes, And small sense of sacrifice; See her waning, fading slowly, See her pass and vanish wholly, Sighing not while Autumn weaves Grave-robes of her withered leaves; Nay, exulting, when anon, To possess her vacant throne, While the heaven grows black and madly Toss the bare boughs to and fro, Winter cometh, shouting hoarsely, o'er the hill top, through the snow! He is comeâhe greets us there; He and I will talk togetherâ I, beside my hearth-fire's glare, He, without, with his wild weather. Pshaw! let ballad-mongers sing, Harping on a worn out string, That old story, old and weary, Of sad Summer's withering; Let them sing, with sour grimaces, Mock tears rolling down their faces, Of a daisy, nipped untimely, Or some other doleful thing. Better faith, I wot, is mine, Winter, while I greet thee there; Thou, without, with thy wild weather, I, beside my hearth-fire's glare. Better faith, ye ballad-mongers, Take it in its sober grace,â That no blessing e'er departeth, But another takes its place: Flowers are takenâout-door gladness, Song and bloom, they both depart; But, by stress of Nature's sadness, Heart draws nearer unto heart. Clouds obscure the sky's sweet azure, Feeble sunshine streameth throughâ All the brighter love up-springeth, With its sunshine warm and true. For the aspects, changed and withered, Of the garden, glen, and stream, See the faces that are gathered Round the yule-fire's ruddy gleam; Kindly faces, cordial faces, Hearty age, and frolic youthâ Who would sigh for shrivelled daisies, 'Mid such joy as this, good sooth! Who would say, amid the laughter, Harping on the old pretenceâ God doth take the gladness from us, When he taketh Summer hence? Whoâbut hark! old Winter shouteth, Till the woodland echoes ring, âTake this faith, ye ballad-mongers,âpr'y thee snap that worn-out string.â A SONG OF THE SMALL POETS. BY A DISSENTIENT MEMBER OF THEIR FRATERNITY. âThe little dainty Poet, Kneeling in his soft cushion on the hearth, And patted on the head by passing maids, Who would discourage him? Enough to say That slender twigs send forth the fiercest flame Not without noise, but ashes soon succeed.â Landor. âWe are the men of the age,â say they,â âWe are the men, and the movers we; So we sing, and sing the livelong day, And the world is swayed by our minstrelsy. Let the shallow statesman fume and fuss, And boast of the changes, wrought..by us! Is the wrong made right? Does the dark turn bright? Is the world o'erspread with a clearer light? You'll find the secret of all ere long, In the under-current, deep and strong, In the stress of our overwhelming song. Kings may make edicts, and schoolmen write, And the sword of the soldier be bared in fight, But aha!âwho winneth the victory? We're the men of the age and the movers we! True, the fire on our hearths is but dim, and worse, Very starved and empty seemeth our purse; And the world, that reapeth the fruit of all, Giveth scanty honour and payment small: But we reck not of this,âif we still sing on The fame and the guerdon will come anon; The sage of the future times shall tell How we laboured long and laboured well,â And how all the glory that befel Was brought about by our wondrous rhyme, That shall never be hushed till the end of time. Then the world shall build us statues fair, And our praise shall be shouted everywhere, Till the truth doth triumph, and all agree That we were the men, and the workers we.â So sang they;âwhile Time, methought, stood by, With a cruel wink in his stony eye. His crooked scythe, all jagged and bare, That he smites great hearts with, was not there,â But he held in his hand what you might infer To be a sort of extinguisher; And while that bevy of little men Croaked loud as an army of frogs in a fen, He would single out one, and then another,â Let fall his handâlo! a sudden smother, A spirt, like that which a candle utters When just at the last it flares and gutters! And behold!âah! how shall my spirit breathe it? When Time's fierce chuckle sounded amain, And the weapon of death was raised again, There was nought but a snuff beneath it! âBut I marked that ever and anon, Though they vanished thus, the chaunt went on, And the vacant seats were one and all Soon filled by new men, just as small; And the latest sound that reached my ear Was the chirp of their treble, shrill and clear, As they piped and crowed in their maudlin glee, âWe're the men of the age, and the movers we!â A FANTASY. 'Midst the flowers at eve she lay, Cradled soft in slumber;â Eyes fast closed, the lashes meek Shadowing o'er the sunny cheek; Lips, by loving lips just prest, Smiling in their rosy rest; Hands white-folded, seeming still With the same love's clasp to thrill; Heartâoh! ring, thou lily bell, Dirges without number! Ring! for, sleeping 'midst the flowers, Death stole in and found her; Sealed the eyes in mortal night, Changed the cheek to ghostly white, Snatched the love-smile from the lips Straightened now in cold eclipse, Grasped each pale hand, that anon Shrank and stiffened into stone, And the heartâring, lily bell, Dirges deep around her! Ring!ânay, nay, earth's love might failâ See, a new smile waketh; Angel-smile it seemeth now, Lighting up lip, cheek and brow, Like some new-found mystic thought, With a solemn gladness fraught! Of God's peace that smile doth tell,â Ay, and His dear love as well; His!âcease, cease, O lily bell, That love ne'er forsaketh! DOLORES in the CHURCH of St. CUNEGUNDE. Storm under heavenâno moon, no star; but by the moaning sea, In the convent church of St. Cunegunde, thrice deep the shadows be, Night, and the Doom of God, and Death, are there,âthe awful Three. She lieth in shroud on the catafalque; and the taper's fitful glare Giveth ghostly light to the pallid brow and the black and sweeping hair And the unclosed eyes, one tale that tellâone fearful tale, despair. She lieth a corpse on the catafalque, what time the priest doth pray, In the choir, to the good St. Cunegunde and the mother of God alway, While the incense-smoke around the bier up-curleth dim and grey. Despair, despair! through the priestly chantâthrough the muttered mass, despairâ St. Cunegunde, Mary, mother of God, they heed nor vow, nor prayer, For the unclosed eyes one tale reveal,âone tale, despair, despair. Approach, lift up the pall,âbehold! oh, rich and perfect form! Oh! royal brow and lip and cheek, unmarred by strife and storm! Meet shrine was that for lofty soul, ere flawed by mortal sin.â Meet, the rapt worship of the world, to challenge and to winâ Meet shrine for passionâholy saints! 'twas passion dwelt therein! Her life was passion: on one die each earthly hope was thrown, All hopeâit failed,âheaven's lightnings fell, and smote their victim proneâ Lo, on the gilded catafalque, she lieth here alone! Vain, vain the uplifted palms,âay, vain that sweet and solemn song; Hence black stoled ministrants, depart, with all your chanting throng! And ye, saints, martyrs, angels, all that breathe heaven's blessed air, Divide, make way before the throne, for one heart-broken prayer,â God, God, the all-merciful! Christ-God! revoke that doom, despair! THE DEATH SCARF. FROM AN OLD LEGEND. Said the knight,ââWilt thou broider this scarf to-day With thy fairy fingers, so daintily?â But the ladye's face was turned awayâ âI am too busy, I wot!â quoth she. And the knight, he left the ladye's bower, But his face was troubled and sad to seeâ âDread is the omen, and dark the hour, When love is too busy for love!â quoth he. He mounted his steed with a doleful air, And he rode away to his own countrie; He said not adien to his ladye fairâ âShe is too busy for that,â thought he. So the ladye sat alone that day, While the sky grew dark and the foe drew nigh; And she bade her page ride fast and say, âCome back, Sir Knight, ere thy ladye die!â Low bowed the pageâloud laughed the knight, And loud laughed all that companie; âNow bear this message, Sir Page, aright,â I am too busy, I wot,â quoth he. The foeman's shafts flew thick and fast, The ladye's vassals were fain to flee; But long ere morn the peril was past, The foeman strickenâthe ladye free. And a wounded knight was brought to her bowerâ Sore wounded, even to death, was he; Dread was the omen, and dark the hour, And the ladye wept full bitterly. For she knew the shield, and she knew the crest, And she knew the pale face, streaked with gore, And she knew the scarf that bound his breast, Whereat she wailed yet more and more. But the knight looked up with glazing ee, As a heavy shadow crept over his browâ âWhen love is too busy for love,â quoth he, âThen death is welcome, I trow!â THE CHILDREN OF THE COURTS. Oh! little ones, poor little ones, That with pale faces play, At morning, and at even-tide, In the city courts alway.â Oh! little ones, poor little ones, I would the power were mine, The power we read of in old tales, Of spirits half divine, To bear ye in a moment hence From your drear haunts away, To the meadows, and the merry light Of the clear, sweet, laughing day. What joy it were to mark the change O'er your sad features pass, When first ye caught the pleasant gleam Of the green and waving grassâ What joy to hear your timid shout As the bright bird flew by, Or o'er the brow of the breezy hill Ye chased the butterfly;â To watch ye wandering, in and out, 'Midst fields and shady nooks, Or stealing through the wood's deep glades, With strange, astonished looks; Or gathering by the road-side paths, The wild flowers, many a one, Then stopping evermore to breathe The fragrance ye had won. And oh, what deeper joy it were O'er your wan cheeks to see Slowly the flush of health o'erspread The hue of miseryâ To mark the gradual wakening Of the glad child-heart within, The torpor from the soul depart, The sense of life begin. Oh! little ones, poor little ones, Ye languish, day by day, With scarce a dream of the fair world That lieth far away;â Yet well I trust, some joys ye have To gild your life's dull streamâ God seeth ye,âGod loveth ye, Though pale and sad ye seem! God loveth ye! Oh! straight that thought Hath round about you thrown A freshness and a fragrance too, A sunshine, all its own;â Perchance it was an erring wish, That human wish of mine; He knoweth bestâHe loveth bestâ His light and gladness shine Apart from leafy woods and flowersâ Where murkiest shadows fall,â Play on, play on, poor little ones,â That love surpasseth all! A JUSTIFICATION. Ah! yesâyou do but tell me what I know; I stand here at the mighty mountain's base, And see the great world-singers sitting calm Amongst the mists and sunbeams up aloft, High up, enthroned beneath the o'erarching heaven. And between me and them, an interval, Of chasm and crag and cloud and precipice And gushing torrents and hot lava-floods, SaithââClimb not!âin that strife were shame and death.â Then wherefore dare to sing? you ask. Go out Into the orchard closes, good my friend, And ask the bee and ask the grasshopper, Why they sing, they, frail creatures of an hour;â Ask why, beneath the same soft loving sky, The artist nightingale woos time to stay With witchery of subtlest cadences, And the poor sparrow twitters overhead In self-asserted insignificance. We are God's creatures allâour natures take His fashioning, and follow in the track His finger tracethâone, a noble stream, Rolling its solemn waters to the sea With a grand muffled thunder, as it spoke To God alone amongst the solitudes;â Another, but a little way-side brook, Bubbling and babbling as it frets its way Amidst the reeds and grassesâboth alike Still flowing and still singing as they flow, In their adjudged vocation. Love them well, Stern friend, those great crowned spirits sitting there In the full glory; they exact your love, Vicegerents as they are of God's behests, Prophets of truth and beauty, His elect, But scorn not me, because I stand below, Armed only with my humbleness, and sing, Without a thought of crowns, or love, or praise, But from a natural impulse thereunto, Which, like God's other creatures under heaven, I question not and scan not, but obey. THE NIGHT OF THE NATIVITY. (A COMMEMORATION) Silence, deep and solemn and unbroken, Like a death-hush fallen from the sky;â As of some dread mystery the token, Seemed that silence breathless and unbrokenâ Pale and wan the stars looked out on high. 'Twas as though, unseen, some mighty spirit, High dispenser of Heaven's minist'rings, Had come down a mission to inherit, And that Earth, in awe of that great spirit, Struck to torpor all her vocal things. Tree, I said, that standest ghostly, hushing All thy thousand pulses . . and thou, stream, Through the misty meadows mutely rushingâ Say, what means this ominous strange hushing? Is Earth trance-bound in some mystic dream? Then a sound, so low it seemed scarce spoken, Blended voice of wind and stream and tree, AnsweredââLeave our quiet still unbrokenâ At this hallowed hour no word be spoken! Silence suiteth best its sanctity. For on night like this,âoh! love eternal!â Wafted downward 'mid ecstatic strains, Came the angels from their courts supernal; Came to tell their tale of love eternal To the shepherds on the Syrian plains. In the moonlight hovered the white legion, Heaven revealing to the mortal ken, And the echoes of the lonely region Keep e'en yet the words of that bright legionâ âPeace on earthâ they saidââGood will to men!â Ay, and not the Syrian echoes solely, All Earth holds that memory undefiled; So when Time brings round, in advent holy, This blest eve, we hear their accents solely Angel accents, murmuring meek and mild. And the stars shine pale and wan with wonder, For they hear afar rich melody, Rolling wave on wave, a rythmic thunder, Deep and deeperâsound of awe and wonder! All God's seraphs shouting joyfully. For this cause, we keep mute watch, O mortal;â Do thou likewiseâto our task incline; Enter straight thine heart's unfolded portal, Hush each clamouring utterance of Earth's Mortal,â Hearken only unto God's Divine. Lusts of life, thy true vocation shaming, Thrust them forth from consecrated ground! Hear instead, the angels still proclaimingâ Hear them say, each angry passion shaming, âPeace on earth,âgood will!ââOh! blessÃ«d sound! Ceased the voice:â'twas true, methought, a spirit, High dispenser of God's gifts to men, Had come down, a mission to inherit, And I bowed before that awful spirit, And I wrestled with my nature then; Wrestled, praying..God, above the glory! Still this tumult,âlet my soul take in All the meaning of that olden story, All its simple truth, and chastened glory, Lost too long 'mid Babel strife within. And not this night only, but for ever, Aid me too, to hold that memory fastâ For a holy spell to calm life's fever, Till its restless flame dies out for ever, And the peace of heaven is won at last. LENORA. She hath left me cold, ice-cold, Grew the fervent love of old;â I waxed weary,âtruth be told! Weary of her love's excess, Of her heart's wild restlessness, And her proud caprice, no less. Fairest woman ne'er can be, By her fairness, more to me Than a moment's phantasy. So, I mind me, one day lying At her feet, my sole replying To her love's impatient sighing, And her questionings of all That might haply yet befall, Change and wrong and evil thrall. WasââBend low, Lenora, low.. Shower thy dark hair o'er my browâ In that midnight, hear me vow. I do love theeâask no moreâ For the future's stock and store Give I thee no pledge, Lenore. No pledgeâchange may well befall Unto us as unto all, Ay and wrong and evil thrall.â Back she swept her hair's dark wreath, PassionateâI saw beneath, All her face was white as death. I could read that agony, Beauty's strong supremacy Smitten in its place on high, At the moment when it fain Would be soothed with promise vain Of a never-ending reign. Do I scorn this human love? Scorn!âI kneel before itâDove, That o'er life's wild sea dost move With strange healing on thy wings,â Angel thou, whose minist'rings Glorify earth's saddest things. Holy angel, sent to prove God's high meanings, wrought aboveâ God be praised for thee, O Love! But mere passion, beautyâpsha! These I take for what they are, For a fallen and falling star. So she left me, yesterday, Grandly, like a queen, whose sway Brooks not mention of decay. And I sit alone, and stare, With half-pleased, half-puzzled air, Atâsole trace, her empty chair.â Pleased! and yet if you had seen All her beauty in its sheen, As she turned, with stately mien, To say farewell;âthe great eyes, Shrines for world-idolatries, Flashing, like a broad sunrise, Full upon me, and the fair Cheekâthe rose-flush glowing there In the radiance, ripe and rare, Of a smile, whose syren light Haunts e'en yet my dreaming sightâ All good angels guide her right! A VISION BETWEEN THE LEAVES. I grant your visions noblerâgods, forsooth, Loom out of your dream shadowsânothing less, Nor meanerâcrowned immortals, smiling down From their pure heaven, who wear the stars for gems And braid the burning sunbeams in their hair, Wreathed round with amaranths, immortal too. Mine was an earthly visionâall of earth,â A vision of a little virgin face, Set like a jewel in the deep wood's shade. Young face it was, fresh as the freshest rose That opens while the balmy dews are falling, Before the break of dawn; athwart the leaves, Thick-clustered, of a climbing hazle copse, It fixed me;-just two blue and brooding eyes, That shone 'twixt golden clouds of floating hair, Serene as in a picture, till anon, A mischievous wild breeze, in petulance, It seemed, at my rapt gaze, with fanning breath Blended both clouds into one soft eclipse, A glimmering haze of leaf and tress entwined; Yet, over-cunning, in the very act, Uplifted other leaves, and so disclosed Twin cheeks, blush-mantled o'er, and then a mouth, Beset all round with little wilful smiles, Flickering and fluttering, breaking out at last Into full sunshine;âwhereupon the breeze, Charmed into quietness, its light wings furled, And the clouds parted, and the azure eyes Smiled too, and all the place was glorified, And I, amid the glory, gazed and gazed, Till..a slight, timid rustle of the bough,â A low laugh, like a silver harmony, Threading the silence,âthen a tripping step, And all was over!âVery brief my bliss, A glimpse, no more,âbut I had seen enough To dream of night and day, and I did dream; Albeit I knew, in the greenwood, nevermore, Through any boughs of hazel, or thick shade Of tangled coppice, should I see again Such apparition as had blessed me then.â Ay, taunt me with your wood-nymphs, water-nymphs, Your demi-gods, and gods Olympian, Dispensers of the thunder and the calmâ Nobler such visionsâI deny not that, And yet I prize my vision, shrining it In my securest nook of memory. HOME GRACES. Give me young voicesâI would fain Have music in my home, A dearer music than from harp Or lute doth ever come; A music that doth give me back From out the buried time Mine own lost youth, and all the joy And mirth that then were mine. The old rude songs I used to sing, The tales I loved to tell To my young sisters, as we roved Through our own quiet dell; My merry shout in field and wood, My laughter full and free By lighted hearthâall this and more Such music bringeth me. Give me young facesâI would fain Have sunshine in my home, A gladder sunshine than from skies Of summer sheen doth come. Young faces, mirrors bright and clear, Wherein my soul may see Each vision of the beautiful Reflected radiantly. Each dream of an untravelled world, Each impulse pure and high, The generous thought, the proud resolve, The buoyant energy. Though shadows oft may flit across, And boding signs be given, Still will it warm my heart to bask In that sweet light of heaven. Give me young heartsâfor I would fain Have fragrance in my home, A fragrance finer than from flowers Of fairest hues doth come; That passeth not at morn or eve, That liveth undecayed Through summer heat and winter frost, Through shifting shine and shade. Hope's fragrance, that doth sweetest seem When grief and gloom are round; Truth's fragrance, exquisite, though rare On this low earthly ground; Affection's fragrance, that doth ne'er From its one centre roam These are the graces I would have To sanctify my home. A SONG OF WASSAIL. So the world is growing old, my friend, Quite grey, you say, and old! So men's hearts are waxing faint, my friend, Good lack, and deadly cold! Ha, ha! I laugh you to scorn, my friend, And I dare to say you nay;â God wot! the world is as hale a world As it was in its early day. Some eyes may blinkâsome foreheads droop, Some hearts wax faint and cold;â Ha, ha! let them come, and quaff with me This âjolly good ale and old!â Let them quaff with me this foaming glass, Yon brave old tankard drain, And my word, but they'll see in a trice, my friend, The world grow young again. My word, as the warm blood fires their eye, And their pulse beats firm and bold, They'll marvel how they could e'er have dreamed Men's hearts were waxing cold. And, good my friend, I will trust you now With a thought that is dear to me; That this world of ours will never be found Too old for blessings three. First, for the light of a cheerful smile, And next, for a minstrel's song, And last, my friend, for fair company, With âjolly good ale and strong.â THE GRAVE IN THE CITY. Not there, not there! Not in that nook that ye deem so fair;â Little reck I of the blue bright sky, And the stream that floweth so murmuringly, And the bending boughs, and the breezy airâ Not there, good friends, not there! In the City Churchyard, where the grass Groweth rank and black, and where never a ray Of that self-same sun doth find its way Through the heaped-up houses' serried massâ Where the only sounds are the voice of the throng, And the clatter of wheels as they rush alongâ Or the plash of the rain, or the wind's hoarse cry, Or the busy tramp of the passer-by, Or the toll of the bell on the heavy airâ Good friends, let it be there! I am old my friends,âI am very oldâ Fourscore and five,âand bitter coldâ Were that air on the hill-side far away; Eighty full years, content I trow, Have I lived in the home where ye see me now, And trod those dark streets day by day, Till my soul doth love them;âI love them all, Each battered pavement, and blackened wall, Each court and corner. Good sooth! to me They are all comely and fair to seeâ They have old facesâeach one doth tell A tale of its own that doth like me well,â A taleâsad, or merry, as it may be, From the quaint old book of my history. And, friends, when this weary pain is past, Fain would I lay me to rest at last In their very midst:âfull sure am I, How dark soever be earth and sky, I shall sleep softlyâI shall know That the things I loved so here below Are about me stillâso never care That my last home looketh all bleak and bareâ Good friends, let it be there! A FRAGMENT. Do you remember how we talked that night? How wildly, sitting in the waning light, Under the spreading ash-tree on the lawn? Do you remember what a thing forlorn Seemed Duty to us thenâDuty, a pale, Cold, ominous shadow, missioned to prevail O'er Love, the beautifulâo'er Love the life, As we conceived it, in that bitter strife With our hard fate's prescriptions:âay, to part, To die,âwhat difference? each bleeding heart Accepted both in one, and hailed the tomb As the best refuge from the sterner doom. And ah! do you remember how through all The grief and the despair, our lips let fall Words that were meant for comfort, that essayed To cheer, to strengthenâthen broke off dismayed, Sounding so hollow, falseâmere mockery! And how at last we sat unconsciously Listening, as in a stupor, while afar, Over the uplands, 'neath the evening star, Came with sonorous cadence on the breeze, Majestic burden to our miseries, The passionate wailing of the smitten seas! AN OVER-SEA GREETING. Over the water, what shall I send to you, O friends afar? Hearken! I greet you with right merry laughter, Ha ha! ha ha! Hearken! 'Twill reach you, howe'er winds and billows Wage their fierce warâ Shake your sides lustilyâclink the glass jollily, O friends afar! And with the laughter, send I, true hearted, Kind thoughts also; Earnest thoughts, loving thoughts, thoughts of home-gatherings, Long, long ago. When the gay song hath ceased, when the loud wassail Dieth away, Think of me lovingly, aye, and undoubtingly, O friends, I pray! For be it known to you, over the water, Friends, every one, That to me Christmas bringeth in sadness, His frost alone. Whilome, he brought me hearth and heart brightness, Bringing me youâ Whilome!âah! well may I claim your mirth-pauses, Good friends and true! Loud blows the wind withoutâwell I remember How in old times, Gladder our hearts became, listening in silence To its wild chimes. Now with what dreariness, that sound doth sway me, Ye may divine;â Sitting alone, beset by haunting memories, O friends of mine! Homeward, with straining eyes, through the deep shadows, Wistful I gaze; Blazing hearths, blythesome looks, smiles and gay glances, Shine through the haze. Then most my household gods, stone cold do mock meâ Then most I own, That to me Christmas bringeth in sadness His frost alone. So, as it oft doth hap in the world's chances, My stave that rose Jocund in greeting, full of lip-laughter, With sighs doth close. Nay, and yet not with sighs,âhope shall come afterâ Hope that ere long I may have ceased to say âover the water,â As in this song: Be it so speedily! shrine that hope faithfully Your hopes among! Fill then the glass againâlet us drink gravely, God's grace to all! Light heart, and steadfast mind, trusting, enduring, Whate'er befall! God's Graceârenew the song, no more sad fancies, That thought to mar;â Clink the glass cordially, laugh again merrily, O friends afar! THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN. What, threescore years and ten!âout-laughed a child, with eager lookâ Oh, good my mother, there'll be timeânay, close that weary book! Hark! very sweet the ousel sings upon the old elm bough, And my trusty hound he waiteth meâI hear him whine e'en now; For I've promised he shall scour to-day the beechwood by the burn, And rouse the coney from the brake and the hare from out the fern: Oh! good my mother, chide me notâsweet mother, smile instead; I'll read anon, when skies grow dark, and the merry months have fled. Tap! tap! said the hammer To the nail in the coffin-lid! Oh, life is very long!âexclaimed the maid between her smiles; What reck I for the solemn priest, who all earth's joy reviles? The time, indeed may come for this glad heart of mine to wear The sadder coloured vesture meet for trial and for care:â But I have lovers twain, to-dayâas all the world doth know, And the sky is very blue above and bright the earth below; And round about my pathway all sweet sounds and scents are shedâ I'll give good heed, O solemn priest!âwhen youthâand theseâhave fled. Tap! tap! said the hammer To the nail in the coffin-lid! Drink, drink, thou sullen, sad-faced loon! why list what dullards say?â Quoth a yeoman old, with rosy cheek, of stalwart heart and gay; There's no such virtue in their prayers and preachings, well I trow, As sparkles up from this full bowl, that saithââCome, quaff me now.â Life's sand runs fast, too well I wotâI'm old, I know, and grey,â But, troth! it seems to me, sir knave, I grow more hale each day: Knock at my door, thou sad-faced loon, when ten good years have fled,â And-ha! ha!âwe'll drain as full a bowl, and never a drop be shed! Tap! tap! said the hammer To the nail in the coffin-lid! THE GREETING ON THE THRESHOLD. Speedeth Time, the unrelenting, Speedeth onward, Time, the King, Severing the years asunder With the waving of his wing. Christmas standeth at our thresholds,â Brothers, through the murky air, Let your hearts lean out and listen,â Ye shall hear his voice declareâ âI am Christmas:âread the records Of the deeds that ye have done; Read, O men, with stedfast vision, By the shining of Truth's sun. Turn the pages, turn them over, Trace ye backward day by day: Ere I pass within your portals, I've a greeting I must say. Have ye walked the world meek-hearted? In your patience, have ye worn Lowly thoughts for inner vesture, Nought of pride, and nought of scorn? Have ye walked the world, love-missioned, Impulse strong, and purpose high, Foremost aye to strive and struggle For the vexed humanity? Have ye chased one cloud of error? Have ye sown one seed of good? Have ye done the work God gave you, Honestly, as true men should? Have ye borne a cheerful aspect, Hoping on through toil and care? Have ye won a poor man's blessing, Or a poor man's broken prayer? Thenâburn bright your hearth-fires! brightly Flash the mirthlight in your eyes! All my olden gladness cheer you, All my jests and jollities! Loving friends be gathered round you, Merry voice and visage gayâ Good befal you! God be with you! Such the greeting I would say. But, if ye have willed to follow Other ways, O men, than these, All regardless of the warning Of life's solemn verities;â If the loves that ye have cherished, Have been self-loves, false and cold, Love of earth, and earth's ambitions, Love of greed and love of gold;â If your hearts have scorned to hearken, In the hour of mastery, To all pleadings of good angels, Pity, Mercy, Charity, If ye've walked alone, self-trusting, Self-sustaining, unsubdued, By God's love, shed warmly round you, And your bond of brotherhood;â Then,âstill lonely, drear and lonely, Be your hearth and be your home! As a ghost from out the charnel Of the dead years, lo! I comeâ Come with gloom and desolation, And a silence, doubly drear, From the sound of pipe and viol And sweet laughter heard anear. Fate-like, I unfold your portals, And I bid you judge aright Of the wisdom ye have worshipped, By the veiling of its light;â And I bid you turn, self-chastened, From the doom and the despair, To the better paths, forsaken, And the joy abiding there; So, when next ye hear my greeting, BlessÃ«d meanings it may bear!â Speedeth Time, the unrelenting, Speedeth onward, Time, the King, Severing the years asunder, With the waving of his wing. Christmas standeth at our thresholdsâ Brothers, through the murky air, Let your hearts lean out and listen, And give answer to him there. OUR ELOPEMENT. Oh, which way are you going? Pr'ythee tell me Summer dearâ For I see your wings are plumed for flight, And your farewell draweth near. Oh! which way are you going? It must be a pleasant wayâ Methinks I'll plume my pinions tooâ Yes mineâone moment stay, Small farewell, sooth, have I to speakâI'll follow you straightway. There, now we'll go together, For who cares to linger here, And mark Earth's beauty fade and die, Heaven's glory disappear. To list the little leaping streams, Flow on with sighing tone, Or the winds amongst the weeping woods Bewail the dead and gone. No, no, we'll go together, You and I, and kindly tell Each other, all the way, those tales We love, sweet Friend, so well; Of the years when Time, the bright and young, Knew nought of wintry hours; When the rosy clouds sent down alone Cool shadows, or soft showers, And Earth stood crowned for evermore with undecaying flowers. Ah, Summer, thou wert fairest then, So saith the Poet's song, When thy revel in the radiant world, Waned not, the whole year long; But Summer, truer song is mineâ I'll sing it here agenâ Time groweth grey and grim, but Thou Art lovely now as then. So we'll journey on together, On afar, o'er heath and hill, And ere the last leaf falleth sere, And the blast blows bleak and chill, We'll reach our refuge, good my Queen, Some blessed clime I know, Where still there's sunshine up above, And song and bloom below. So I pr'ythee faint not Summerâ Lo! I vow a merry vow, That we'll dance anon together, Underneath the full-leaved bough; And away, away with that withered wreath, You're wearing thus in vain! Full soon, while birds and piping winds Prepare their festal strain, I'll twist a braid of opening flowers, and crown thee o'er again. SHADE AND SUNSHINE. âNot in this tapestried chamber, good my brother; Let us go forth, in the sunshine. Truth will show us Her full face in the light.â âAnon. Love sat brooding in the dark, Gloomy thoughts stole o'er him; All life's shows looked grim and stark In the path before him. And âah yes, it waneth, it waneth!â Poor Love, 'mid his sighs complaineth, âThere's a changeâI can see it growing In those eyes no longer flowing With the light of the soul for me. There's a change in the lips' calm smiling. Those lips of old beguiling Each pang of the world's reviling, With their meanings fair to see.â And still, while Love, unweary, Poured all his plaints on air, Through the shadows, dusk and dreary, A sweet voice sought him there. It stole to his ear unheeding, Through the depths of the twilight grove, With words of gentlest pleading, And a cry âI loveâI love!â In vain!âLove still bewaileth âThat bitter change prevaileth! I see it darkly, darkly, in each separate glance and motion, And fading, withering slowly, The joys of life sink lowly, Borne earthward with a shattered faith, and a crushed heart's devotion. Oh false and feeble-hearted! Oh light leaf on the wind! Poor dream of days departed, In bitter memories shrined! Poor dream, that shed a golden ray, Of gladness round and o'er me A moment's spaceânow fled for aye, Lo, night and storm before me! But vain these tears, these sighs profound, Vain this half-uttered story; Away!âmethinks a mocking sound Rings through the forest hoary!â Love stept from out that shaded ground Into the sunshine's glory. Love stept from out that covert dark, The blue heaven glittered o'er him; Less grim he thought life's shows and stark Along the path before him. And as a lurid mist awhile O'er all doth darkly hover, Then melt beneath the morning's smile And the green earth discover, So that great cloud of doubts and fears, Lit by the truth, waxed lighter, And like unto the golden noon, His soul grew bright and brighter; Till Hope, that long had breathless lain, Spent by his vain endeavour, Sprang up within his soul again More bold and strong than ever. And âAh, yes, she lovethâshe loveth!â Quoth Loveââeach doubt removeth; 'Twas a dream and a wanton folly Of the sick fiend, Melancholy, And life still hath its joys for me!â Then Love looked back at the shaded track And he sighed regretfully. And lo! as he mused unweary, On that new thought and fair, From the shadows, dusk and dreary, A sweet voice sought him there; It stole to his ear, close-heeding, From the depths of the twilight grove, With words of gentlest pleading And a cry âI loveâI love!â THE WORLD AND THE POET. A THOUGHT OF KEATS. âWe heed thee not!âgive o'er, give o'er!â Said the World, as the Poet poured The wealth of his soul and its glory forth In burning thought and wordâ âGive o'er, give o'er!â Then a darkness fell on the Poet's face, An omen of death and doom, Ah me! ah me! what tears rained down When soon, in the shadowy tomb, His rest was won. âWe will weave a crown for this Poet's brow,â Said the World: âwe will build a throne For his kingly fame; and from shore to shore For aye shall his name be knownâ For aye, for aye!â Amen! to that loving deed, O Worldâ Amen! brave World art thou; With thy bitter scorn for the beating heart, And thy crown for the corpse's browâ Amen! O World! LOVE IN THE ALPUXARAS. Under a cork-tree, deep in the shade Of the Alpuxaras, I wooed a maid; She was plump as a chesnut, grown In a Catalan sunshineâand as brown. First, I wooed her with smiles, and then Sighed âlike furnace,â o'er and agen. Long she listened, then laughing gay, Sang me a snatch of an ancient lay. âThere was a damsel lived in a dell,â Dames of Nevada! Dames of Nevada! And a Cavalier bold, he loved her well, He loved her wellâ Knights of Grenada! Knights of Grenada!â Flinty and rough was the ground, ah me! Yet down I dropped upon bended knee, And vow upon vow I volubly uttered, While my heart beat quick and my pulses fluttered. In delicate phrases, quaintly adorned, I coaxed and wheedled, flattered and fawned; But lo! in the midst, with an âall very prettyâ Sort of look, she went on singing her ditty: âQuoth the damsel, âSir, be frank and freeââ Dames of Nevada! Dames of Nevada! âDare you wed a maiden of low degree,â Of low degreeâ Knights of Grenada! Knights of Grenada?â Saints! was it any thing in the air Struck such a chill through my blood? I declare I had well nigh fainted;âpale and red Grew I by turns, while that one word âwedâ Smote on my ears like a tocsin, dispelling Visions of bliss with its sudden knelling. Curled the red lip of the maid, and then Her clear voice broke into song agen:â âBlank looked the suitor and sore forlornâ Dames of Nevada! Dames of Nevada! And the damsel laughed his love to scorn, His love to scornâ Knights of Grenada! Knights of Grenada!â Scorn!â'twas the only word, in sooth; There was no disguising that plain truthâ With a lifted brow and a flashing eye, She fronted me in her purity, And her glanceâoh! it made my soul confess Its shame, and her own true nobleness; Mute and abashed I stood, and anon With a sigh she left meâsinging on: ââAlbeit a cavalier boldâ, quoth sheâ Dames of Nevada! Dames of Nevada! âA lover art thou of low degree, Of low degree!â Knights of Grenada! Knights of Grenada!â THE ANGEL OF THE SHADOW. Death is not hideous, child; I have seen death; Ay, in a dream, but smile not; fuller light Breaks on us oftimes from beyond the veil, In that strange separate state, than is vouchsafed In the full noontide sunshine of the life You deem so real. In dream, then, I saw Death. Two forms were kneeling by a couch, whereon A little maid, meek-faced, with soft brown hair, Lay dying. The great strife was well nigh o'er; Life had obeyed the summonsâheld itself Prepared to go, and hovered, as it were, Upon the very threshold of its home, With wings outspread;âwhile fitfully there rose A thrilling murmur, not from those still lips, Sealed from all speaking, but a voice of prayer, Broken by passionate sobbing, that burst forth From hearts which strove to feel âthy will be done!â But could not, for the clinging human love. Oh! very grievous grew that agony Of strong affection, wrecked upon the rocks Of Heaven's immutable judgment,âwhen, behold! On a sudden, all the room grew solemn-dim, And hovering o'er the couch, methought I saw A shape, as of an angel glorified, Bright mid the shadows, and thrice beautiful, With such a look of pure beatitude, You saw at once it was God's minister, Sent downward on a blessÃ«d errand there. One shining hand, outstretched, fair, and as fresh As from Heaven's living waters just withdrawn, Touched the poor sufferer's brow;âthen ceased the strife, And all the bitter pain died out at once; And when those mourners, half in hope, half fear, Upraised their weeping glances, they beheld, Not Death, the Angel, but their loved one, dead; Ay, saw God's ordinance made manifest, While the grief-torrent overswept their souls. But still the angel hovered o'er the clay With aspect very pitiful, as if It fain would yield some solace, ere it fled, To those heart-broken ones;âanon, I saw The glistening hand laid lovingly again Upon the poor wrenched brow, and vacant eyes, And on the pallor of the sunken cheeks, While to the blue-cold lips, those radiant ones, Those lips of Heaven, were pressed a moment's space, Softly and tenderly, till such a smile Grew there, and such a perfect calm was spread O'er every feature of the meek, dead face; It was as though the spirit of the child Said, âFather, mother, there is bliss in death; Take comfort, O beloved! I go to God.â Then, beautiful beyond all human thought, Grew that rapt angel's countenance, lit up With love, that glowed, and glowed, till all the air Seemed filled as if with Godlight, in the midst Of which effulgence, from my enraptured sight, Passed the pure spirit, leaving nought below But the calm dead, the human agony, And this thought, shining in my inmost soul, Like a great star amid the glooms of earthâ Death is not hideousâDeath is Love, andâLife. THE KNELL OF THE MONARCHIES. A sound borne from afar, A solemn and ghostly sound; Like a mighty bell that tolleth the knell Of a king by fate discrowned. It tolleth ever and aye,â Both night and day it tolleth; Nor space nor time can stay its chime, Still on and on it rolleth. On, o'er the city streets, On, over meadow and lea; O'er the forest wide, o'er the green hill-side, On, on. o'er the sweeping sea! And whoso heareth the sound, Doth hear as it were the roar Of waves that leap from a fathomless deep, And break on a shingly shore. Doth hear as it were the rush Of a multitudinous throng, The tramp of feet o'er the stony street, And the voice of savage song. All discords blent in one, Shouts, murmurs, shrieks, and groans, And a cry of wail, that telleth a tale Of shaken and shattered thrones. It tolleth for aye, that bell, And some grow faint and pale, As it rolleth in, with ominous din, As they list its ghostly tale. But some start up in joy, With fiery flashing eyes, That see from the night a glorious light, And a mighty hope arise. A light long quenched in cloud, A hope long nursed in vain; The bright sun-rise of their liberties O'er the despot's broken chain. O thou, of the sealÃ«d scroll, O Future, 'tis thine to shew, If the hope or fear be meetest here, The joy, or eke the woe. One task, meanwhile, is oursâ To wait; full sure to see God's light illume the rayless gloom, Make clear the mystery; Full sure, oh, ghostly bell, Despite thy boding tones, His stedfast will controlleth still This wreck of crowns and thrones. A FLOWER-FOLLY. I have culled a little flower to-nightâ Say where, say where! âIn the garden beds, by the soft moonlight?â Not there, not there! It was gathered,âponder well on this,â In a sheltered nook, in a bower of bliss; Now tell me, young man, tender and true, Do they love the sun, or the silver dew, These flowers so fair? âLet me see the blossom...pearly and white, With its leaves half-folded from the light,â With a stem all downy and moss o'ergrown, And a perfume..but that is not its own;â Fair Sir, these blossoms are of the few That love neither sun nor silver dew; They love but to nestle in soft repose For a passing moment, then slowly close, (Faint with a rapture, too great to bear) And die..ah! where? Where? merry maiden, that smilest so, Thou canst read the riddleâthat blush doth show Where the flower was culled; oh! fairest, take To its rest, the exile, for pity's sake; Ere its languid leaves for ever close Let it nestle again in soft repose, And so shall you make it clear anew, Why these flowers care so little for sun and dew, And what is their rapture past compare, In dying..there.â THE WHITE ANGEL. Between swart Pluto and bronze Polypheme, Stands my white angel carved in alabaster; A delicate art-fancy, looking most Like petrified pure Alpine snow, transformed, By some strange elemental witchery, Into a spirit's fair similitude. Swart Pluto eyes her grimly, 'neath the thick, Black pent-house of his overhanging brows, As if he marvelled through what unknown air, From what far region o'er Olympian calms, Such vision had descended. Polyphemeâ Huge bulk, but with a tender heart informed, Full of old loves and haunting memories, Looks sadly at her . . looks beyond her, where Death-pale, in the drear past, by ocean's verge, A goddess-maiden, beautiful as she, Sits wailing evermore beneath the moon. Thanks Luigi, thanks, my sprightly Florentine! Gay neighbour, in the rambling palace home, Where once, in my fresh youth, I dreamed away Three long, bright, glowing summer months of bliss. Ah, Luigi! how we lived in those old days! How we felt life!âyou, in your studio, perched High up amongst the roofs, on the shady side Of the great grass-grown courtâworking betimes In the cool morning;âin my idlesse, I, Loitering and looking on, or listening To the glad under current of the song That seemed to float your fancies into life, With magical impulsion. How you sang, The day you finished my white angel there! Some snatches of that pleasant melody, Ring in mine ears e'en yetâa dulcet strain, A love-lay for two voices, was it not? For little Bice, poor Arlotto's child, Who came that morning from the farm, with grapes And water-melons for our thirsty noon, Blent her clear tones with yours, and unawares, It may be, left some record of herself In the rare cunning of your handiwork. Dear little Bice! how she stared, the while She watched your chisel tripping lightly o'er The exquisite fair faceâcoaxing a smile To hover round the lipsâoutshedding calm On the high foreheadâwaving the broad stream Of floating hair, or adding, plume on plume, To the white glory of the folded wings, Drooped meekly, earthward. We all sang . . ay, all, When, the last touch bestowed, your statue stood In its perfected grace:âwe sang till walls And windows thrilled, and Bice's childish voice, Swelling, exulting, like a lark's up-borne Over the topmost cloud beneath the sky, Poured its sweet silver treble through the storm, Till it seemed to stir the down on the snowy vans Of the immaculate angel, and uplift The light transparent folds of drapery. 'Twas holyday, the rest of that bright day,â And the hot noon o'erpast, we loosed our boat And down the Arno, in the golden light, Cheerily floated; store of wine we took, With little Bice for our cup-bearerâ With little Bice for our singing birdâ And merry were the tales we told, and brave The plans we planned, and as each amber flask Poured gurglingly its hoarded treasure out, Our hearts leaped up to the flowery heights of joy And the jests sparkled on our laughing lips. On, on, we drifted, far adown the stream, Till the red radiance of the setting sun Paled in the west, and with a steadfast front, Majestical in its tranquillity, Sank nobly to his rest the dying day; And the shades crept and deepened, till at last The purple twilight melted into night, And all the cloudless heaven grew white with stars. Then homeward, homeward, with an altered song, An altered converse,âour brave plans pulled down A little from the skiey eminence, That with their Monte-Pulciano wings They had scaled so boldlyâBice's Ave sounding Like the low plaintive cooing of a dove Over the quiet water. So at length,â Exchanging happy thoughts, or roaming through The labyrinthine paths of silent dreams, We reached the landing-placeâreached presently, With loitering steps, our home; and how it fell Upon our hearts, my Luigi, like spring dew, When climbing our steep stair, and looking in Through the deserted studio's open door, We saw the first pale moonbeams shining full On the uplifted, glorified calm brow Of our new angel on its pedestal. So like a spirit in the gloom it looked, I could have bowed my forehead to the dust, In adoration Little Bice said, Half in a whisper,ââThe good angels thereââ Pointing with upward finger to the sky,â âHave owned their fair white sister here below.â Ah, Luigi! how we lived in those old days! Lived! LITTLE MABEL'S SONG INSCRIBED TO MY LITTLE FRIENDâF. G?. âSpring, Spring, idle Spring! I have called thee all the dayâ Whither art thou wandering, Idle Spring, I pray?â Little Mabel Morrison Was a simple village child; You shall hear the song she sang In her âwood-notes wild.â Spring, Spring, idle Spring! I have sought thee everywhereâ In the glen, and on the hill, Through the meadows, by the rill,â But thou wert not there. I have sought for many an hour For the first wild violet flower, Through its young leaves peeping; To the woods I've been to learn If the pale, sweet lady-fern, In the brake beside the burn, Had arisen from sleeping, Spring, Spring, idle Spring! Not a trace of anything! And the birds all feared to sing, And the trees were weeping. I've a little bird within That doth love thee dearly; Greeting thee with merry din When thou comest early. Now, no note of joy hath heâ On his perch so droopingly He doth sit, sad-hearted, Deeming that for aye, sweet Spring, Thou and he are parted. I've a little garden too, Full of flowers, the fairest; Red, and white, and pied, and blue, And rich scents the rarest; And those flowers are waiting now For thy touch to wake them; They are waiting, every one, For the shining of thy sun, Ere their dreams forsake them. Oh! dear Spring, sweet Spring, I pray, Drive those dull dark clouds away, Let the blue sky cheer us! Well-a-day, my prayer is vain, Faster falls the beating rain, And thou wilt not hear us. Oh! what joy 'twould be to me To behold thee coming, With the beetle's drowsy lay, With the lark's glad roundelay, And the bee's wild humming. Come then, springâslow-footed Spring! I have called thee many a day; Cease thy truant loitering, Idle Spring, I pray. So sang Mabel Morrison, In her simple wood-notes wild, Till the Winter's gloom was past, Till the sunshine came at last, And the blue sky smiled. THE LAST SONG OF WINTER. I am singing my last wild song! A song that soundeth from hill and plain, With the howling wind, and the lashing rain, And the forest's roar, as the hurricane Doth sweep its boughs among. I am singing my last wild song! For my crown of frost is melting away, Drop by drop; and the icy chains, Wherewith I fettered my broad domains, Will yield, I wot, to a warmer sway, And loose their clasp ere long. I am singing my last wild song! Louder and louder, ye storm-winds all! Ere ye 'scape, for a season, my savage thrall, Ye shall feel my strength;âmad rain, mad rain, Faster, and faster!âHo! hurricane, Thy ruinous blast prolong! I am singing my last wild song! I must quit my throne, but the earth shall see That I go in the pomp of my royalty, And mine ancient strengthâit shall see at morn, By the tall trees scathed, and stripped, and torn, With a conqueror's tread, o'er a realm forlorn, I have passed with my shouting throng. I am singing my last wild song! But beware, oh Earth!âif thou bend the knee To the glory of Summerârevengefully, With a fiercer might, will I come again, With a tyrannous hate, to my sunless reign, And bind thee down, 'neath a heavier chain, With pitiless grasp and strong. I am singing my last wild song! My last!âHa! laughest thou? Again, Ere long, thou shalt list to the same rude strain! My last!â'twas a merry jest, I trowâ Ocean must shrink, and the great sun grow Faint in the skies, and the end of all Sweep to destruction this earthly ball, Ere I sing my last wild song! MUMMY-WRAPPING. What! you would speak out your thoughtâ Out, quite plainly!âsore distraught, You must be, young Poet;âknow, Nowadays, bards sing not so. What! espouse that worn-out style, âThe worn-out poetry of antique times, I fling asideââ Exclaims our latest Poet, the Author of âReverberations.â An ungracious abnegation, to say the least, seeing that the writer of lt never so clearly proves his poetship as when he reverts to those very antiquities of the Muse. Treating of Free Trade and Modern Revolutions, he does but attain to rash prophecy, or mere prosiness, but when he goes back to Thor, and Balder, and Alcestis, and Admetus, he makes ns feel two thingsâhis own skill and high quality as a Poet, and the beauty of the antique song. Spencer's, Chaucer'sâflowing bright As the full, clear morning light, With no symptom in the air Of the least fog anywhere; Pshaw! the world would only smile At your follyâfolks have grown All too wise to spend their praises On such antiquated graces. No, the plan, by which alone Bards win honour for their verse Now, is the complete reverse Of your own, and lies in hiding All their thoughts and all their meanings, So that not the smallest gleanings, High or low, be found abiding; So that men may read and read This way, that way, up and down, And when the obscure has grown Into a conglomeration Past all human extrication, May cryââVery fine indeed!â Fancying, poor simple souls, That in the midst of such a pother, Under all the dust and smother, There must lie, spread richly out, Hints, suggestions, parts and wholes Of grand truthsâtoo grand, no doubt, To adopt a simpler fashion, For their mighty revelation. In old Egypt, land of sages, Lighter of the dusky ages, Men, by mummy wrapping arts, Strove to save their mortal parts; Stuffing each departed friend, With all sorts of compound messes, Drugs and other nastinesses, Smearing them with oils and greases,â And concluding with no end Of tight folds and bands, whereby Every trace of human creature, Each familiar form and feature, Vanished, faded utterly, And the poor defunct, forgotten Before long, as well might be, Grinned beneath his mile of cotton With a ghastly irony. Poets, in these latter days, Go ahead of such trite ways; Let their bodies seek the goals Natural to themâlife once ended, But meanwhile, make wonderful Mummies of their sentient souls; Wrap them round with strange devices, And embalm with mystic spices, So that when the oracle To set speech hath condescended, Seems it, that whate'er he says Hath had very far to travel, And the labyrinth unravel Of a thousand bandages; Which begets a sad delusion In some minds, that such orations Reveries, dreams, vaticinations, Are mere chaos and confusion. But the World, young poet, oh! Take my word for it, draws no Such deductions;âit descries Glories, graces, ecstacies, In this muffled speech, which it Honours with a tribute fit Of gold-scatteringsâwhence you'll see Ev'n great minds take readily To the fashionâminds that might Fill the whole earth with their light, Shining, like fixed stars sublime, In the zenith of all time; But who, bitten by this mimic, Mystic, masking epidemic, Hurry, and are all agog To be lanterns in a fog. Go, ask famous Emerson, How his crowns and palms are won, And he'll tell you, it may beâ âPartly by the verity And the luminous discourse, That my soul would utter, by Right of its nobility, And that men approved, perforce; But far more, young bard, I deem, By my new, fine-writing scheme, That the age greets with such clapping; Or, to use a figure, screening An immensity of meaningâ By my skill in mummy-wrapping.â Lest any wrong inference be drawn from this passage, let me hasten to say that I join gratefully in the verdict which assigus to Mr. Emerson a foremost place amongst the earnest and original thinkers of the day. That he should have adopted, at times, an eccentricity of style, which must too often serve as a wall of partition between him and his readers, cannot fail to be matter of regret to all bnt those who look upon such eccentricity, not only as a proof of originality, but also as its fit and necessary accompaniment. Mr. Emerson himself, however, in his âRepresentative Men,â accepts the axiom that every thought clearly conceived may also be clearly expressed, and thereby either condemns his own practice, or reflects on the lucidity of his thinking. Would it be too much to ask of him, and of his English friend, Mr. Carlyle also,âvehement declaimers, as they both are, against the âshamsâ and âcantsâ of the day, to think a little of this sham also, and for the sake of their consistency, to âput it downâ Go, ask scores of othersâyou'll Find them an extensive school;â Although differing of course Chiefly from that famous one, The aforesaid Emerson, By still less of verity And of luminous discourse; Yet, in the main, they all agree;â In confusion, each doth see Acme of sublimity; Each deems smoke, in poet-fires, Chief perfection;âeach aspires To draw down the age's clapping By his skill in mummy-wrapping. Shame!âyou sayâthat this should beâ Burying talents in the earthâ Desecrating God's great blessing;â By a folly past expressing, Mocking its immortal worth!â Ah! if these your notions be, If such crotchets haunt you still, Go, young Poetâhave your willâ Follow out your fantasy:â Sing, as larks sing, no note failing, Make your lays clear, strong, prevailingâ Let your style flow calm and steady, As a stream without an eddy;â Strip your whole thought bare to view, As the antique singers do; And you may find, here and there, Readers, praisers,âdon't despair!â Some poor, good old-fashioned soul, Now and then, may cheer, console, With his dusty commendationâ But for public acceptationâ If the aim of your ambition Be the world's warm recognition, Then, turn back,âat once turn back, From that obsolete, stale track, Do as the rest doâseek your bays In their orthodox new ways, And draw down the age's clapping By your skill in mummy-wrapping. THE BELEAGUERED OAK. Hark! how the winds among the giant boughs Of the old oak are raging; to and fro They toss his skeleton limbs, and howl the while, As if in mockery of his changed estate. Fain would they rend his noble heart asunder, And hurl his towering grandeur in the dust, But he defies themâstubborn in his strength, He groans, but yields notâhe bethinks him too, Perchance, how soon swift time will give him back The glory of his prime. Ah, then the winds, Robbed of their strength, and all their fierceness gone, Will float around him with an altered tone, Will sing sweet melodies the livelong day, And nestle softly, thro' the starry hours, Amongst his curtaining foliage. Then, a host Of merry birds will greet him evermore With their glad lays, till all his young green leaves, All the quick pulses of his mighty frame, Thrill with delightâthen, summer skies will shower The golden sunlight on his head by day, The silvery dew by night, and men will rest Safe sheltered from the sultry noon-tide glare Beneath his broad, deep shade. So is he strong, So steadfast, to withstand the tyranny Of the rude blast,âand so the peasant, doomed To toil from morn till eve on the bleak hills, Doth brave the sufferance, and, with manly soul, Bear up against the present weariness, By thinking of the hour when he shall see The lightâah, not of the great stars in heaven, But the faint ray, the beacon of his rest, From his cottage lattice gleaming. On his ear, In the pauses of his labour, oft doth fall The welcoming voice of his true-hearted wife, Or the shrill laughter of his little ones. He sees the ruddy blaze of his warm hearth; Feels the sweet sunshine of the smile of home; And cheered and strengthened by these joys to come, Turns with blythe spirit to his task again. MISTRESS MADELINE'S PENANCE. Mistress Madeline, my ladye, You shall pine to dayâ Never smile and look so sprightly, Never toss your head so lightlyâ Mistress Madeline, I tell you, You shall pine to-day! Hooded hawk away!âcontent thee With thy perch, pardie! Not a ray of morning's brightness Is in store for thee. Hound, that snuffest the fresh breezes, Couch! for thou must stay By my side, till gloaming cometh And the sky is greyâ Mistress Madeline, thy ladye, Goes not forth to-day. Pr'ythee why?âwe rode together, False one, yestermorn; Never day of eastern summer Knew a brighter dawn; And you thought so, very clearly Smiled your lips that truth; Hound and hawk were happy sharers In your joy, good sooth! You had smiles for bird and blossom, Smiles for stream and tree, Smiles for earth and smiles for heaven, But not one for meâ Mistress Madeline, my ladye, Not one smile for me! And you spoke, as if your fancies Wandered like your smile; Little recked you of the shadows On my face the while. Mort-dieu! I grew black as tempest,â With a scowling brow Vowed I a great vow of vengeance, And must keep it now;â Mistress Madeline, my ladye, I must keep that vow! Ah! sly mocker, still art smiling With that face demure? Tune thine harp and sing unweary, Till thou work my cure, Ditties of the olden ages That I love the best, Ditties of a leal devotion In true woman's breast: All day long, till gloaming cometh, Thou must sit by meâ Sit, and sing and smile, more fairly Than on flower and tree; All day long till gloaming cometh, And no thought must stray, Not a single fitful fancy Wander hence away;â Mistress Madeline, this penance Thou must do to-day. For I hold it treason, ladye, Such as ne'er should be, To be lured, as thou wert, lightly From love's loyalty. Loveâa flower-crowned god, you deem himâ It may be, but still, Laws hath he of sternest fashion And a vengeful will. Try him, tamper with his roses, And ere long you'll own That their slender stems are garnished Not with moss alone. Mort-dieu? you shall own it, minion, Whatsoe'er befallâ Ere the sun drop from the welkin, Ere you 'scape my thrallâ Mistress Madeline, my ladye, Oh! be sure you shall! ROAD-SONG OF THE PEASANT. My path is o'er the frozen hills, The wind blows keenly in my face, The shadows of the advancing night Creep on with lengthening pace;â Ha! ha! I laugh at the bitter blastâ I shall see the smile of my home at last! More faint doth grow the light, and thick And fast the snow-flakes drift around; All silently my footfall sinks Upon the muffled ground;â Ha! ha! let the storm howl on,âere long I shall listen, at ease, to a softer song! There's not a single star looks forth; The deep and rayless gloom doth fall Upon the wintry earth, as dark And sad as funeral pall;â Ha! ha! I've a ray within, too bright To be quenched by the gloom of the darkest night! The hills are passedâthe valley stream Sweeps by me, wlth its sullen roarâ 'Tis crossedâmy rest is well-night won, My weary travail o'er. Ha! ha! methinks I feel e'en now The flash of the firelight on my brow! With brisker steps I hurry on, My eager gaze still bent before, Where aye, through storm and gloom, shines out My open cottage door;â Ha! ha! I hear young voices callâ They are thereâmy wife and my dear ones all! THE CORNER APART. You complain the world grows prosyâdo as I do, Blanche, my treasure, Set apart a little corner in your mind, sweet maid, and there Cage your Fancy, like a singing bird, and make it, for chief pleasure, Cover life's cold common places with a woof of visions rare. Then away from all the turmoil that so frets and so fatigues you, You'll take refuge in your castle, built where no world-discords areâ On some mountain-crag in dreamland, looking whence, for leagues and leagues, you See only flocks and herds, or eke some gallant knight afar. Ay, some Knight, that you, in outrage of my constant fond pretension, Crying pshaw! to all my sentiment, and heedless of my sighs, May unclose your castle gates to, with right courteous condescension, Just to see how love in olden days lit up a suitor's eyes. Or what say you, shall our fancies, Blanche, my queen, be caged together? Happy thought! they'll build us castles, twice as fair and twice as strong; And besides you'd find it lonely else, despite the halcyon weather, For I warn you dreamland suitors are a sad unreal throng. Do you need increased persuasion? Nay, believe me then, my fairy Is a wonder-working wizard, worth a thousand such as thine; You'll own his art pre-eminent, his patience exemplary, When his magic spells are woven close around your soul and minc. Your lithe fancy, gentle creature, has been nurtured to meek uses, All its incantations bounded to some soft and silken dream;â Mine's a hardy mountain stroller, that no toilsome task refuses,â Let him aid his weaker sister,âBlanche, what say you to my scheme? If the world in truth grows prosy, then accept the proffered pleasureâ Come, see the golden sunsets glow on plains of Arcady; Come feast with gnomes, in Brocken halls, amid their piled-up treasure, Come dance with merry elfin folk beneath the green-wood tree! We'll have tilts and we'll have tournays, and the troubadours shall sing us All their lays of high achievement, lays of love, and lays of war; Or we'll take the wings of swiftness that our trusty spirits bring us, And soar up to hear the spheric songs that float from star to star. Brief pause, brief intermissionâstill, illusion on illusion, Like flashings of the Northern lights, shall be our magic dream; Swift flitting tints, that burn and blend in one harmonious fusion, With changes bright and manifoldâwhat say you to my scheme? Why, what can you say, poor captive to your social life's conventions, To its mill-horse round of routine, chained, alas! whate'er befall, With no single source of solace save in such benign inventions, Why what can you say, butââCatch those sprites, and cage them once for all!â HEART-USES. Hearts are not for teasing, Lady mineâ Hearts for loving, hearts for deep believing, For strong hoping, never for deceiving, Nay, nor yet for teasing, Lady mine. Hearts are not for scorning, Lady mineâ Hearts for grieving, hearts for bitter breaking, For fast clinging, never for forsaking, Nay, nor yet for scorning, Lady mine. Hearts are all for loving, Lady mineâ Lovingâtease me with thine eyes' endeavour, Scorn me with thy lips, but still, for ever, Hearts are all for loving, Lady mine. âBE A CHEERFUL POET!â Be a cheerful Poet! That is wellâthe wind saith, singing by;â That is well, the blue and bending sky Echoes softly;âthat is wellâeach ray Of the cheerful light, no less would say, Were it vocal;âmark, amongst the snows Winter's little lonely flower unclose, Pure and pale as they, but telling still, Spite of bitter blast and icy chill, Of a bright time coming; telling too Of a blessing, hidden from the view Ev'n in rudest frost, and wildest weather;â Such thy task be! Faith and Hope together, Take for Muses!âto their bidding bowed, Ever see the sun behind the cloud; Ever see, though windy tempests blow, Flowers upspringing underneath the snow; Comfort, see, in troubleâlove, in wrathâ Balm of healing in the thorniest pathâ God in all,âthat so thy songs may be Ministers of God in their degree, And through storm and calm their task pursue Loyally, as flowers and sunbeams do. Ask thy ransomed soul, inclining low At Christ's feet, if life be only woe; If all poet harmonies should be Wrung from one sole chord of misery; If best service may be offered up By out-pouring tears from life's full cupâ Pouring tears and wafting sighs alone, In drear sameness, heavenward to God's throne. Ask, and straight thine eager soul shall risc, From Christ's feet, with upward glancing eyes Full of joy and blessing, and shall cryâ âNay! by His dear blood, shed lovingly For our sinâby His full victory Over death and loss, this life should be Lifted out of gloom, and glorified By that crowning glory. Be thy lays Strong to follow then, where Faith doth guideâ Strong to soar above life's narrow ways, Through the mist of natural pain and care, Dark, but transient, to that calmer air O'er the thunder, where, in mystic beaming, Glows the Godlight from the cross outstreaming. Yet avoid not sorrowâtenderly Touch that string, for oh! thy lyre must be Tuned to suit a vexed humanity; With the weeping, weepâthe sighing, sigh; Only, through each sadness, still descry Light out-breaking, promise of release, In the cloud, God's bow, proclaiming peace. He whose strain with grief alone is rife, Endless lamentation, tears and strife, Adds but discord to the hymn of life!â Soul, amen! true teacher!âSinger, thou To that inner verdict meekly bowâ Be a cheerful Poet! THE LONG AGO. A spirit walks beside me, pale but fair, With still face shaded by dim-floating hair; And ever, at brief intervals, while loud Resound the strife and tumult of the crowd, While the absorbing Present sternly claims All my devotion, all my hopes and aims, She bids me, in a whisper soft and low, âGive one kind memory to the long ago!â No other speech hath sheâunchangeable, One aspect for all times, fixed, and yet full Of a most tender pleading;âso, when stand New friends around me, a belovÃ«d band, When cordial words from lip to lip are passed, Light jests, or graver fancies, overcast With a calm pensiveness;âwhen heart to heart Confides its stored-up treasuresâstill, apart, Filling the pauses, pleads that whisper low, âOne memory for the friends of long ago!â Alike, when roaming through new lands, I climb Wood-cinctured mountains, in the golden time Of summer, scanning, with enamoured gaze Plains, vallies, pastures, gleaming through the haze; Tracts, by primeval forests overrun, Or populous cities, sleeping in the sun; Out of the hush that whisper seems to grow, Like the wind's murmur. with as sweet a flowâ âOne memory, for the scenes of long ago!â And ever, when I hear it, the dead Past Throws off its cerements; visions, thick and fast, Throng round meâfriends, I left on the far strand Of orient childhood, from that halcyon land Gaze on me, greet me, bid me taste once more The sweet and simple happiness of yore. And my lost home smiles at me, through the shade Of the apple-branchesâits grey walls arrayed With bloom of climbing roses, or broad leaves Of vine and ivy, and beneath the eaves Just the one swallow's nestâthe sameâI hear, Methinks, the young birds' twitter, shrill and clear, In the fresh morning . . . Oh! kind spirit, stay For ever by my side, through life's rude way! Ne'er let the Present's joys, the Future's dreams, Possess me wholly: still by those hushed streams And phantom-peopled meadows let me roam, In the dim shadow-world which is thy home. Come chance, come change, unmoved through all be thou, The same true faithful monitor as now; And till Death beckons me, with ghostly hand, Into the mysteries of his shadow-land, O heart of mine, nor cold, nor careless grow, In welcome of that warning whisper lowâ âOne thought, one memory, give the long ago!â WHEN I WAS A CHILD. âHenceforth thou must eschew Lofty rhyme, and sip the dew And to us be liegeman trueâ When the moon is at its height, We will meet thee and indite Fairy lore for thee to write.â The Fairies' Address to the Poet, by G. Beard. When I was a little child, I had a friend, a fairy, A playmate, merry and wildâ Good lack! when I saw him first, the droll Was skimming the cream from the brordest bowl On the topmost shelf of the dairy. âLittle man,ââquoth heââbe wary and wise!ââ And finger on lip, right cunningly He peered all round him, with winking eyesâ Then . . went on skimming the cream, as free As if good maid Margery, I declare, For his sole provision had placed it there. He was not a pretty fairyâno; Rather wizened and wrinkled, but so Full of frolic and waggery! And in his will-o'-the-wispish eye There was something you might descryâ Something gentle and kind and trueâ âIf you will but love me, I'll love you!ââ It seemed to whisper, and while my gaze Dwelt on his antics and winning ways, I felt, were he thrice an elf, that clearly It were no hard task to love him dearly. So I let him drink, for he seemed to grow Fairer and plumper at every draught Of the thick rich cream, that careful and slow, He skimmed to the edge of the bowlâthen quaffed With a smack of the lips for indication Of his inward comfort and consolation. When his meal was over, (ah me, ah me! What a sight that bowl for maid Margery!) He leaped, in a trice, to the dairy floor, And with quirks and gambols, many and sore, Sidled up to where I stood, and smiledâ And âChildâlet me see your face, good child!â Said the elfâand while his fingers cleared The curls from my forehead, his keen eyes peered Deep into mine, and wandered over Each feature as though he would fain discover All my child-nature and disposition:â No fear had I, not a whit of fear, As he drew me nearer and yet more near; I let him finish his inquisition; At last, while a smile of confident pleasure Made his queer face comely beyond measure,â âLittle friendâaha! little friend!â he said, Then away, through the open lattice, sped Swift as a sunbeam, . . that was all Our talk that day, but I well recall I felt as if somehow, I had made A kind of promise, and Madge the maid From that time forth vowed vehemently That the dairy lattice bewitched must be, For with all her bolting at eventide, She was sure to find it swinging wide Next morn, and the cream-bowl empty and dryâ âLittle friendâaha! little friend!ââthought I. And that was how our friendship began;â Oh! but the after frolic and fun! In the midsummer time, at set of sun When the floating vapours and clouds grew dun, And the stars shone through them, one by one, In the orchard crofts, I was sure to hear A little piping, musical sound, Now dying away, now drawing near, Now whirling and eddying, round and round; And to me that sound seemed ever to sayâ âCome out and follow me far away!â So stealthily, through the orchard trees, I was wont to creep, and there, at his ease, Deep in the grass, with a puffed-out cheek, Blowing his magical trumpet call, From a blue convolvolus flower, or eke Pear-leaf, or spear-grass, best of all,â I was sure to find my skimmer of cream Ready to flit with the first moonbeam, And take me with him, o'er mead and stream, Into the deepest of deep wood places, Out of the way of all human traces, Where he would seat me safe in the fern, Whispering ever, in waggish guise, As at first,ââGood child, be wary and wise!â And when he had kissed me on the eyes, I could see through the darkness, and discern In the open glades and under the trees, All the fairy folk and their revelries. Oh! the merry songs I've heard them sing! And the merry tales I've heard them tell! If I could but tune my jaded string To the proper pitch, I know full well Their very echo would straight enthrall, With a spell, my listeners, one and all. And the festival nights too! nights of state! Once, from my covert, I saw the Queen, A sweet little lady of royal mien, Hold her levee, in the midst of her great Lieges and vassals. Her Verderer, Gold Stick, Head Warden and Almoner, Her Lords and Ladies in waiting, and troops Of Maids of Honour, all lined the slopes Of the little hillock, where her throne, An oak-apple fresh, with rose leaves strewn, Stood in the fullest light of the moon. And pleasant it was to see them bring, Each and all of the fairy hostâ Tax and tribute and offering: One brought a glow-worm that had lost His way in the woods, despite his candle; Another, a riband of Indian grass, Lissome and smooth, that for lady's sandal, Doth all other ribands surpass. One came laden with purple heather, Scented and sweet, for the royal floor; Another offered a King-fisher's feather, Bluer than bluest of summer weather, And gifted with virtues twainâthe one, That it served for a plume, while the dance went on, The otherâa fan, when the dance was o'er. Some brought provender, nut and pear, Strawberry, wood-apple, rosy and fair, Chesnuts and dew-berries, store of all, To honour the royal festival. Others catered for fun alone;â One, 'mid a general titter and stir, Came, arm in arm, with an overgrown, Gawky sprig of a grasshopper, Whom he cozened and coaxed at last into dancing, With a great deal of comical jerking and prancing, On a tight-rope,âin his feelers holding A reed, for balanceâfeat worth beholding. One, on a frog's back, reached the station, Strumming, with infinite animation, On a drum the frog's own corporation. And one, my notable friend, came in, All grimace and giggle and grin, Dragging a spider, lean and long, Tied by the leg, with a triple thong Of his own thick webâthis filled the measure Of the fairy mirthâwith turbulent pleasure, Gentle and simple, they crowded round, And with jeers and laughter, strove to confound Their luckless victim; they made him pass Through showers of dew, and with bearded grass, Towzled and tickled him, till he grewâ Not black in the face, he was that alreadyâ But swollen with rage, while he wriggled through The menacing blades, all sharp and steady. At last, with a scuffle, he overthrew A score of his foes, and setting out At the top of his speed, from the rabble rout, Got free, and with sundry bruises and tumours, Crawled home to his den in the worst of humours. When the sport was over, the feast was spread, And the fairy Court, the Queen at their head, Sat down in the moss, with each a broad Sycamore leaf for a plate, and a cup Dropped from the oak, and at once filled up With hyppocrass, by trim pages poured From vases of infinite shapes and hues; From lupine-leaves, whence the liquor fell In great round beads, and from many a bell And wood-bine tube, that to rains and dews Give their odour and sweetnessâthe elfin Queen Drank from a goblet of glittering sheen, A campanula flower, wrought curiously With a shining gossamer fillagree. Then the royal Taster plied his vocation With laudable zeal and self-negation, And soon all mouths were busyâthe platters Cleared, and the dainties and other matters Duly discussedâin bumpers fine They drank to the Queen, with nine times nineâ Whereupon the Chancellor, rather mellow, Trolled out something about a âvery good fellowââ Which made the Queen blush,âbut ah! just then When the mirth was waxing wild again, And Gold Stick, after a deep potation, Had stuck quite fast, in his grand oration, Mid the winks and nudges of all aroundâ Just then, I say, a terrible sound, Faint in the distance, my heart dismayedâ 'Twas so like the hollo of Madge the maid! Again and again it rose, and . . . yesâ There was no mistaking its emphasis, So out of the fern I sprang, and away! (For till then, my rambles had 'scaped detection) Through glen and thicket, my friend the fay Holding me still in his safe protectionâ Homeward I scudded, and well a day! What an outbreak of indignation Greeted me there!âwhat stormy reprovings! When they bade me give an account of my rovings, And I stuck as fast, in my explanation As Gold Stick did in his grand oration. When my childhood waned, I lost my friendâ One autumn morning, he said good bye, With a mournful look, that seemed to portend Trouble of some kind, hovering nigh. Sadly pale and pensive and altered He had grown of late, and his voice quite faltered As he talked of change and of innovation, And threw out hints about emigrationâ For he said the world was growing too wise For fairy frolics and fantasies, Too wise and coldâthen his little eyes Filled fast with tearsâwhich he strove in vain To hide:âhe should ne'er return again, He told me, noâhe was going to share, With his folk, a land, serene and fair, Far off but I could not make out where. Then he kissed me thrice on the mouth, poor fayâ Stroked my curls down, just in his old kind way, Looked wistfully into my face, and anon, With a little sob, broke off and was gone. Gone! how my eyes streamed down with tears, When I felt I had lost him! years upon years Have passed since then, and trouble and sorrow Have come as thickly as night and morrow, But that was the greatest trouble of all, I really believeâfor there seemed to fall As it were a veil on the earthâthe green, Deep woods were widowed of half their sheen; And the flowersâhow common and real they grew! Mere flowers no more;âin the beds, the blue Convolvolus bloomed and faded, but ne'er Poured forth on the quiet evening air That little piping, musical sound, So sweet in my ears, when it seemed to sayâ âCome out, and follow me far away!â And the spear-grass rotted into the ground, Just as unheeding;âthe silver dews The charm of their freshness seemed to lose, And the moonlight, the moonlight!âeven now, I could almost weep to remember how Leaden and ghastly, and dim it shone, To my fancy, when the fays were gone. Gone!âwere they gone? or was I alone Changing, receding, leaving the strand For ever, of that calm, lovely land, Where they dwelt? Had I grown over-wise, Like the world, for their pretty fantasiesâ Over-wise, and cold? I know not, although Sometimes I have feared it might be soâ Child, that dost read these pages, go, With a pure child-heart, beneath the trees, When the night is working its witcheries, When the wind sits singing amongst the boughs, When the midsummer moonlight overflows, And bring me answer, yes, or no. L' ENVOI. You'll gather the May-bloom, O friends, I know;â You'll seek the violets, where they're wont to grow, In sunny glades and dells;âyou'll cull the rare, First briar-roses, blushing faint and fair: But will you deign to lift from out the grass, Where I have laid it, close to where you'll pass, This posy of my gathering? Pale its hues And faint its perfume ah! you'll scarcely choose To bear it far, I fear;âto bear it home? No chance of thatâthough you'll accord it some Slight praise, it may be, in your pity, ere You drop it in the dust, and leave it there. Well, be it so!âno blameâflowers bloom and die By myriads, daily, underneath God's sky, Quite unregarded;âdo they bloom in vain For this?âoh, heresy!âI dare maintain A happier faithâdare argue hopefully, Uplooking to that same blue loving sky, That no poor blossom, wheresoe'er upspringingâ And no true song, howe'er unheard the singing, But hath its mission One at least can scanâ But serves some purpose in the eternal plan. Say then you leave my wreath unheeded, where I've laid itâI shall still not quite despair, While from belief like this, such comfort floweth, For, that I've twined it with true heart, God knoweth!</field>
