      <field name="fulltext">TO SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON, Bart., THIS VOLUME IS MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED, IN TESTIMONY OF THAT ESTEEM AND VENERATION WITH WHICH HIS GENIUS IS REGARDED BY THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SEA-KING. CANTO I. The Legend of Otlauga. “? Her heart was full Of passions which had found no natural scope; Feelings which there had grown, but ripened not.” Curse of Kehama. “Dreamers are together in the spirit, although in the body apart.” Christopher North, Vol. 3. I. The huntsman long had left the chase, And the strong winds blew their shrillest blast; And o'er the moon's translucent face The pale clouds flew, and flitted fast. And far away in the mountains, Those hills of eternal snows, The clear crystalline fountains Were silenced in repose. For an icy hand had chained their course, And made them bend to its peerless force. II. And ever as the moon shone fair On the barren mountain-height, And the night-star beamed On the ice that gleamed With a glancing shivering light; While the wind whistled past full drearily, The traveller paused to see a sight, As well in the tempest as see he might, What well I ween he wished not to see. III. Those foot-prints in that world of snows, So fair and firmly set; Who once has seen, for ever knows And never,—never will forget. In the midst of the print a mystic sign, Whose meaning no man may divine, In the form of a harp is shown: As though it were wrought by an Artist's hand, And firmly fixed in that dreary land On a block of marble-stone. IV. And that harp it is said Was dyed a blood red Wherever its impress was seen; Like a boding sign, Or a bloody design, Enwrought on the field Of the tragic shield All silvery-bright, and sheen. V. Those deep, mysterious, foot-prints oft Have been found in regions drear; In vales below,—on hills aloft, In regions far and near. And oft in the depth of the dreariest nights, Far, far away on Norwegian heights, When the moon has beamed, And the stars have gleamed On the lakes in the vales below, Those prints have been seen, In the meteor-sheen, Imbedded deeply in the snow. VI. But whence they come, or where they go, No man may tell, no man may know. They have been seen in the glouting glen, Untrodden by the foot of men. They have been found in the isles of the sea, As bleak and as barren, as barren may be. 'Tis said they have passed those chambers dread Where the Genii are confined; And 'tis said they have passed the charmed ring Where the Duerga and Jotun and Genii sing With the Demons and Juhles and the souls of the dead, To the whistling of the wind. VII. 'Tis said those foot-prints might be found, Through all the land of wonders; Where Fenris in his cavern bound Howls to the ceaseless thunders: Where Utgarda—Loke in his dismal cave, More dreary far than the yawning grave In darkness sits enchained, And those angry snakes by hatred fed, Hang o'er the rocks with his own blood red For ever and for ever drip, Their poison on his blanched lip, And tear his tortured head. VIII. Impressed in the snow, Of the world below, Where the Black Palace stands In its poisonous lands, And looks towards the gates of the terrible North; Those steps might be seen, In the lightning sheen When the fire from Muspeil issues forth. IX. Through Muspeils-heim at the end of the world, Where the dreaded Surtur reigns; And the banner of fire forever unfurled, Is waved in unquenchable flames. Through all that land those steps have gone, Weary, wayworn, and alone. X. In Niflheim dread, where Hela dwells And binds the dead, in their cursed cells, In her nine worlds of despotic sway, Shrouded in darkness, and far from the day, Those mysterious steps have gone, Weary, wayworn, and alone. XI. Borne on the blast The snow falls fast Round the warrior's dwelling at night, And he hears on the wind In the regions behind,— Far away on the mountain-height,— Sweet sounds descending, With the wild winds blending Till the dawning of the light. The Wanderer treads the fleecy ground And well the warrior knows, Those mystic footsteps may be found Implanted in the snows. XII. But now in the halls of Spangareid, The lamps are trimmed, and the fires are bright; But sad indeed, is the traveller's meed Who wanders in so drear a night, For the wind that comes from the mountain's height Is cutting-cold and chill, And the eyes are dazed with the icy light As the snow-flakes gleam on the weary sight From valley, glen, and hill. XIII. And in the hall sat the lady fair,— Otlauga the far famed shepherdess; With beaming eye and silken hair Ywimpled all in loveliness. The renown of her beauty had travelled far, 'Twas spoken of in peace and war; And warriors strong, and warriors bold And men of high degree; Had flocked from regions all untold, Her wondrous charms to see. But they went away with a troublous sigh, For she looked on them all with a cheerless eye. XIV. Strange tales were told of that lady bright, And stranger of her pedigree; 'Tis said she would go in the stormiest night And sail about on the terrible sea: And lash the fierce waves when they mounted on high, To storm the gates of the ebon sky. XV. Whence that lady came no man could tell, But the old and the young remember well, That direful night when the ocean was riven, And tempest-tossed by the winds of heaven, When they heard far away on the distant sea Sounds as sweet as sounds could be, Soft and shrill and very wild, Like the warblings of a child. XVI. Then responses would arise That seemed to come from the distant skies, Now they rose still mounting higher Like the wildest notes of the sweetest lyre, Till the loud tempest's hoarsest roar, Drove the sweet sounds far away from the shore. But when a calm would intervene, Those trancing sounds were heard between, Still darkness was round, and nothing was seen. XVII. But when the cheering morning light, Came dancing o'er the mountain's height, Full many were astir to reach The rocky borders of the beach. And laying there upon the ground, A beauteous harp was quickly found, And all who saw both young and old, Declared it was of the purest gold. XVIII. But ere they touched the harp, the wind Blew a blast from across the sea, Then strains that thrilled through every mind Made sweetest melody. And a voice within, 'twas faint and low, Was heard to whisper “mother ho!” XIX. The hearers started back aghast, In silence deep, a moment passed; When from the harp a child Whose face was fair and whose eyes were wild, From the side towards the North Came issuing forth, And sweetly on them smiled. XX. She said she had come from a far countree, Beneath the waves of the deep green sea, Where beings bright, and beings fair, Knew nought of trouble, of grief, or of care, But love and joy and peace were there And perfect amity. “An ye throw that harp to the surging wave And let it descend to my mother's grave,— With you I will dwell, with you I will stay” That lovely maiden 'gan to say, “But if not I will leave you” she said, “And then in that harp I will sail away Far from the light of the upper day To the land of the peaceful dead.” XXI. And oh she was so sweet a child, And she spake in accents soft and mild, And what she said was all so wild That their hearts were melted quite; And they cast the harp to the surging deep, Beneath whose waves the dead men sleep, And it vanished from their sight. And the child they took to their dwelling place, And they said her features bore the trace Of lineage long and high; And they thought she had come From the spirit's home,— Far beneath the deep green sea, Where all are happy as spirits can be, Or the land that is hid by the sky. XXII. And her fame spread far o'er land and flood, And the maiden grew to womanhood In beauty and in charms;— Some thought it strange that one so mild, Should love to hear those legends wild Of war and its alarms,— But praised was he whoe'er could bring Some tidings of that dread Sea-King Who set the world in arms. XXIII. From the time when she came o'er the distant sea,— From the time of her earliest infancy, She had heard the dreaded Ragnar's name, Till she joyed in his far resounding fame. And she would list with a charmed ear To tales that curdled the hearer's blood; Of achievements high in regions drear, And battles won, by land and flood;— Till her eye would beam With a flashing light, Like the lightning's gleam In the darkest night, And the blood to her temples would come and would go Like a crimson tide in a land of snow. XXIV. Till at the naming of that name The maiden glowed like a living flame; And her features have been seen to flush, With the crimson tints of the rose's blush.— They thought it strange she was thus moved, Some hinted that the lady loved. It could not be the hearers said, For she ne'er had seen that man of dread. They little wot I ween that she Could love her own soul's phantasye. XXV. But others said they could not tell, It might be that that lady,—fair, Saw shapes and forms, and knew them well;— To other eyes invisible, Above, beneath, and in the air. XXVI. 'Twas whispered when that lady high, Floated away on the surging sea; And sang her songs so merrilye To the winds that whistled by:— That she held secret converse deep With spirits wild, and demons dread Who never rest, and never sleep, But who in companies oft have pass'd With the spirits of air, and the souls of the dead, On the wings of the midnight blast. XXVII. I cannot tell how this may be, For truth is often a mysterye.— But it is known that lady bright, And it is known that lady fair, Loved to tread the mountain bare Beneath the stars of the chilly night;— When from above, and from below The wind came whistling through the air, When all around were hills of snow, And rugged rocks, and caverns drear, No trace of human dwelling near,— But forests bleak, and mountains high Peering away to the frozen sky. XXVIII. Why wandereth forth that lovely maid Beneath the night's mysterious shade? Why loveth she the boiling sea, And the wind that moaneth piteouslye? An though she be a spirit's child, Spirits love not ceaseless war, And endless din, and nightly jar, And tumult fierce, and discord wild,— Then why that lovely lady high, As pure as is the cloudless sky, That lady modest meek and mild? XXIX. She loveth well the cheerless night, That is the time for musing deep; When the moon and the stars make a glimmering light And mortals sink in tranced sleep.— That is the time when in the soul, Phantoms enter one by one; And thoughts mysterious darkly roll, That vanish when the night is gone, That is the time for musings high, When the night stars twinkle in the sky. XXX. She loveth well the stormy sea, And the wind that whistleth shrill; For these are aye in sympathy With her wild ungoverned will. She wanders forth because her breast Is filled with visions wild; She wanders forth—she cannot rest That lovely spirit's child. XXXI. By night, by day a vision dread Haunteth that lady fair, It is not spirit of the dead Nor demon dire with wings outspread Nor spirit of the air. 'Tis far more fierce, and far more fell, More bloody and more terrible, Than fiend of air, or fiend of hell. XXXII. The day dreams of that lady bright, Are pictures in the mind, Of what the horror-haunted night In haste has left behind. That lady knoweth not I ween, What those mysterious visions mean. XXXIII. There appeareth in that lady's dreams A dreary lake or sea. Not fed by brooks or purling streams That murmur to the slumbering beams Of the moon light piteouslye. That lady seeth,—(ghastly sight!) A sea of gore and boiling blood, Enveloped in the clouds of night; Where floateth slow a vessel dark, On the surface of that sanguine flood;— No sail is seen about that bark, But shivering shrouds and masts full high, Are traced like net work in the sky. XXXIV. Some mystic power invisible, By force of word, or force of spell Moveth that ship of fear and dread: For it glideth ever on—on—on— Though mortal man there is not one To guide it over the slumbering flood; And it seemeth as though the silent dead Slept their long sleep In that vessel deep That saileth away on that sea of blood.— That sleep that will last for ever and aye Till the dead shall awake, at the judgment day. XXXV. Silence dwelt about that ship, Save when the whooping owl would dip Her white wing in that bloody sea; Then starting,—cry, and away—away To those caverns drear shut out from the day, Or nestle in the storm-rent tree. Or save when the moaning midnight wind Came from the icy hills behind, And swept like a pestilence over the wave, That was silent and still as the warrior's grave. XXXVI. No human footstep e'er might tread, The black deck of that vessel dread. Above, beneath, within, around Human form might not be found. There rested on that vessel proud, A misty and a sleeping cloud. And well that lovely lady knew That sleeping cloud was but a shroud To hide a being from her view. She knew it enshrouded a shadowy form, More dreadful than Niord who governs the storm. And her fancy would picture full strongly I ween, The form of the man whom she never had seen, Whose fame made the halls of the stormy North ring, Ragnar the fierce, the wild Sea-King. XXXVII. And when that vessel dread had pass'd Sounds came floating on the blast; Wild and of the mournful kind, And they came and they went with the whistling wind. Through a cloud far over head The moon her pale beams sweetly shed, But sickening with the ghastly sight She shrouded herself in the mists of the night. XXXVIII. She had stayed long enough for that lady to see (On the borders of that sea of blood, Whose waves were all slumbering treacherously,—) Mighty rocks in confusion hurled, All naked and bare like the ribs of the world. And on these rocks a figure stood And spake to the being who sailed on the flood. “I have found where she dwelleth that child of the sea Thou shalt see her I ween right speedilye.” And he who spake seemed an aged man, And his eyes were cold and his visage was wan, And his white hair sailed on the sweeping wind, And seemed like a silver stream floating behind. XXXIX. The night was cloudy those rocks were bare, And the moon seemed frozen in the air. A harp which ever the wild wind fanned That old man held in his withered hand. The strains were melting sad and shrill, And they wandered far o'er rock and hill. The bat hung over the cave to hear Those sounds that floated far and near. The wolf no longer howled in the night, The owlet paused in her wheeling flight To list to the wind as it whistled by; For it bore on its nervous wings, Thrilling sound and melting sigh From that harp's mysterious strings. XL. 'Tis strange how such a thing could be,— But that lady felt a sympathye With that harp and its plaintive strain, Is it memory fair that recalleth the past Portraying the pleasures that would not last? What is it that giveth that lady pain? See the pearly tear-drops dim her eye, She shivers and heaveth a heavy sigh. What is it that aileth that lady fair Is it the wind or the cold night air, Or is it a vision or is it a spell? She felt its power but she could not tell. XLI. She found it hard herself to restrain, When she heard that music wild; And the days of her infancy came again, And she felt herself a child. While to those strains the caverns ring The spirit within her compelled her to sing. And oh she sang a song of dread! 'Twas the same that is sung by the souls of the dead. It was a song too dire to name, And she shivered and trembled throughout her frame. Who taught her that song? I would I could tell But she sang it full wildly and sang it full well. XLII. Maid! dost know the silent moon Swathed in clouds, will vanish soon? Hearest thou not that step so slow Trampling in the frozen snow? And seest thou not that mystic sign Whose meaning no man may divine? Hearest thou not a ghastly groan? And lovely lady canst not see That aged man with his eyes of stone So firmly fixed and set on thee? Oh! that aged man is a man of dread, And his eyes are as cold as the eyes of the dead! XLIII. Why doth that lady start and quiver? Why should she gasp? and why should she shiver? What seeth that lady fair and bright, Is it a phantom of the night That draweth her breath and blasteth her sight? Her spirit wandereth here and there, Her spirit wandereth every-where. Backward, forward, through various times, Up and down in various climes. XLIV. She is a mysterious maid I wis, She knoweth this full well; But whence she came or who she is The maiden cannot tell! Now her soul wandereth to the past Swifter than the northern blast, To the scenes of her early infancye. Oh! that is a wondrous place I ween,— She cannot tell what those may be Who wander about with garments sheen Beneath the waves of the boundless sea. 'Tis strange the maiden cannot tell, She knew them once I ween right well. XLV. Swift as a wandering beam of light Her trembling spirit taketh flight And hideth itself in futurity. Oh that is a land both dim and drear,— A region dark of dread and fear: And it seemeth an isle in that bloody sea. But the maid is recalled from her reverie,— Though the night is dark she still may see A figure moving warilye Towards the rock on which she stands. And that is the man if man he be Who hath travelled o'er many a far countree, Wherever that aged man may go A bloody harp is impressed in the snow! XLVI. That aged man is drawing near, Lovely lady have a care! He is a man of dread and fear,— Look not at his eye so cold Touch thou not his hand so old;— Keep thy distance, and beware! But the lady awoke with a shriek and a start, For an icy hand was upon her heart.— XLVII. Otlauga often dreamt this dream, And still she saw that ghastly sight, That sanguine and mysterious stream, Enveloped by the clouds of night. And that vessel dread went o'er the wave, Like a spectre gliding about a grave. And still she saw that aged man;— Like a frozen form he ever stood, With his cheerless eye and visage wan Beside the silent sea of blood. But whether it was a dream,—or whether It was not sight and a dream together, Or whether a vision, or whether a spell, The Gods may know, but I cannot tell. XLVIII. But they who wander in the night, Have sometimes seen a figure white Descend the chilly mountain's height And enter a gloomy glen: Impervious to the cheering light, Unknown to the sons of men. Now some have said this figure fair, Was the spirit of her who slept below;— This figure that lighter than fluid air, Skimmed over the frozen snow. And though the maid might know it not, She was one in a scene that should not be forgot! XLIX. Her maidens once to her chamber came, To see their lady at night; And there by the light of the flickering flame, They saw a vision bright. It is not their lady that layeth there, It cannot be,—oh no!— Their lady like the rose is fair, But that figure is whiter than snow!— Motionless, passionless, pale as death, That being layeth there alone, Ye list in vain fair maids,—for breath Cometh not from a marble-stone. L. That night in the darkening vale below, Where nought but rushes and reeds might grow, The traveller saw by the light of the moon That swimmeth in ether and vanisheth soon,— On the snow's fair breast, Foot-prints impressed, The one was deep but the other was slight, As though some being fair and light Had sought protection of another, Perhaps a father, perhaps a brother;— But he shivered and started as well he might For in both he saw the bloody sign, Whose meaning no man may divine! LI. But in her room when the morn came round, The maidens fair, their mistress found. Her eye was dim, her lip was white, As though she had passed a weary night. “Thou hast a wild unearthly look, Fair lady say, what aileth thee?” Her lips were close as a sealed book, She sighed,—but not a word spake she. Till the fire in her dark eye 'gan to gleam, And then she said she had dreamt a dream. CANTO II. The Scald. “And would the noble lady deign To listen to an old man's strain, Though stiff his hand, his voice though weak He thought e'en yet the sooth to speak That, if she loved the harp to hear, He could make music to her ear,—” Scott. Lay of the Last Minstrel. “Now lithin and listinith, and Herkinith you aright And ye shullin hear me tell You of a doughti Knight.” Chaucer. The Coke's Tale of Gamelyn. I. But now Otlauga sat in her hall, And many a guest sat silent there;— The lamps were lit, the fires were bright,— Outside the clouds formed a funeral pall For the moon as it slept in the frozen air, And the stars that hung in the chambers of night Were wan as ghosts in the pale moonlight; Mountains of ice, and frozen snow Were here,—were there,—above and below. II. The wind came whistling loud and chill, Down many a glen, o'er many a hill, But in the hall the guests were still; They moved not a limb, they breathed not a breath, As though they sat in the chambers of death: And yet each bright enquiring eye Is fixed on one object,—ask ye why? III. An aged man standeth silent there, With brow so noble and head so bare, Deserted by the last white hair That used to speak of times gone by, A tear stood in his melting eye, And that old man sighed full well I ween When the last lock went from his aged brow, For it told of joys that once have been And recalled full many an early scene That must be forgotten now. Dissevered from the past he stands, And holds a harp in his trembling hands. IV. For he was one of the tuneful train, And he would sing of beauty's power, And that old man knew I ween right well To wile away the weary hour With many a wild and fervid strain. And he could sing of magic spell, And well he loved I ween to tell The glorious deeds of arms; And he could picture to the sight, The bloody field, the fearful fight With non-intrinsic charms. Such power belongs alone to those Whom genius favors with her woes. V. And now he struck the sounding strings, Forth came a soft and plaintive strain, Wild, sweet unearthly murmurings That rose and fell and rose again, Like the wind sweeping o'er the main. The old man then inclined his head His life seemed gone,—his spirit fled,— So deeply was attention hung On the notes that from his harp-strings rung. The strain the old man faultless found, His ear could catch no jarring sound. A deeper, nobler prelude ran, Ere thus the Scald his tale began. THE SCALD'S TALE. VI. Along by the side of a rushing stream Two beings were gliding as if in a dream; The one was a warrior noble and tall, The other a lady very fair, A shadowy figure with auburn hair; And her beautiful bright and expressive eyes Were a deeper blue than the summer skies. But sorrow saddened her marble brow, And her bosom heaved with many a sigh, “Oh! Rollo, thou canst not leave me now, Thou canst not leave me thus to die. VII. “Let others seek the battle field, Who neither love nor friendship know, Let others smite the glittering shield Thou Rollo wilt not, shalt not go! In my sleep last night a figure came, A figure all in horror drest; His eyes sent forth a sickly flame, And a ghastly wound was in his breast. VIII. I looked upon his noble brow, But it was damp as any cloud, And,—Rollo if I see thee now I saw thee then and in thy shroud! The blood ran freezing to my heart, I shall forget it,—never—never— Oh hear me! if we now should part, We part, I know we part,—forever!” IX. “Nay, dearest Thora, say not so, Let not illusions break thy rest; And weep thou not o'er fancied woe, Nor let vain dreams disturb thy breast. Fierce Gylfe comes rushing in his might, His armed hosts come thundering on, And Thora I must join the fight Ere death or victory be won.” He said, and turned his head aside To hide the pulsing of his heart, He turned his secret pain to hide, He found it hard I ween to part. X The maiden marked his secret grief, She saw the tear stand in his eye, And aye she would for his relief Have shared that deep, reluctant sigh. She strove his fixed resolve to move And keep him from the bloody fray; “I pray thee by the power of love, And by the heavenly host above My life,—my Rollo stay away. XI. “But if the wailings of the dying, And if the deep despairing groan, Are sweeter than a maiden's sighing Then go,—and leave me all alone. And if the hideous form of war Presents an aspect fair to thee, Surpassing my poor charms by far,— Oh! then forget thy love and me, And go,—and raise the battle cry, Why should thy lingering footsteps stay? Nor shed a tear, nor heave a sigh For thou art happier far, away. Haste, haste, and leave the maid alone Who only asks a maiden's part, Heed not her prayer, her sigh, her groan, Go, Rollo go,—and break my heart!” XII. “Nay Thora check these idle fears, My duty calls me hence away, Restrain the torrent of thy tears, I must not, cannot, dare not stay. How could I at my country's need Desert her when I ought to bleed? Perish the thought! my very name Would be a lasting mark of shame. And if I thus should recreant prove, I could not look on thee again, The very sight would give me pain, I should feel far beneath thy love, Thou wouldst be lost to me forever;— Thora it cannot be,—no never! XIII. “And Thora though thou sorrowest now, Thou soon shalt deck a victor's brow. I seek the field the maddening fight To set my native country free, The Gods will surely aid the right And I will think of them and thee. Nay lovely being weep no more, Thy sighs, thy doubts, thy fears are vain, For when the bloody strife is o'er We two shall surely meet again.—” “Yes in another world,” she said, And meekly hung her pensive head. THE SCALD'S TALE, continued. XIV. The Valkyries maids of mystery, Who weave the web of destiny, Were busy on that fatal day, To chase tormenting pain away. The wounded warrior was their care, They softened many a deadly blow, The generous maids were ready there To cherish hope, to check despair, And stay the power of weeping woe— Were there to say who should succeed, And who should fall, and who should bleed, And who should fight, and who should fly, And who should slay, and who should die. XV. And as they sped more fleet than air They saw that lovely parting pair. And aye they heaved a heavy sigh, And, if such thing could ever be, The tear stood trembling in their eye While they read the scroll of destiny. And as they passed,—that fatal throng, They trilled a chorus loud and long. The Valkyries' Chorus. XVI. “Sing, sisters, sing while the dew-drops are steeping “The fair drooping flowers in the valley below; “Sing, sisters, sing ere warriors are sleeping “In the darkness of death, in the frenzy of woe. “Sing, ere tumult drives his car “Midst the bloody ranks of war, “Ere Hela's pestilential breath “Tells mortality of death. “Sing, for ere the pale moonlight “Breaketh on the depth of night, “A being aye as Nossa fair, “And pure and chaste as Giosne “Shall be beyond the reach of care “In realms of peace and purity. XVII. “Sing, for a hero shall enter Valhalla “Triumphantly led, “With the spoils of the dead “Gracing his hands and gracing his head. “And that maiden bright and fair “Who loved him so well in the world below, “Shall be with him forever there, “Unknown to grief, unknown to woe, “Never to part, ah never! ah no! “But they two shall wander “Where bright streams meander, “Near the mansions of Vingolf, of friendship and love; “And they shall bask in beams of light, “And they shall be like visions bright “In that glorious land above. “Sing, sisters, sing while the dew-drops are steeping “The fair drooping flowers in the valley below; “Sing, sisters, sing ere warriors are sleeping “In the darkness of death, in the frenzy of woe.” THE SCALD'S TALE concluded. XVIII. From Asgard's bright and glistening halls Odin surveyed the world below; He saw the floods, the waterfalls, And eke the streams empurpled flow; He saw the blood distilled like rain, Upon that sanguine battle plain. XIX. It was a ghastly sight I ween, But to add terror to the scene Thoron thundered from on high; Thunder crash, and groan and sigh Mingled with the battle cry. Din and discord, tumult dread Wore the restless hours away, Many warriors fought and bled, Many warriors' spirits fled Away to the land of the silent dead On that dire and bloody day. XX. When the sun came from the eastern sky, Then commenced the fierce alarms, And when he clomb the heavens on high Still were heard the battle cry, And the ceaseless din of arms. And when in pomp and grandeur drest He sunk into the gorgeous west, Still the bloody banner waved, Still the gory shield was clashing, Broken armour still was crashing, And still each man his foeman braved. But when the night came creeping on, Battle cry, and gasping moan, Shriek of pain, and dying groan, Tumult, discord,—all were gone. And one pale star, like a conscious eye, Twinkled alone in the peaceful sky. XXI. Thora sat in her peaceful bower, Silent and alone sat she, Many a long, long weary hour She waited there impatiently. She was there with the rising sun, And she was there when his course was run, And she was there when the battle's din Made her shiver her soul within. And when that boding silence came, She seemed to be the only one Of mortal birth, of human frame, Who had not breathed her last, and gone. But she was pale as the image of death, And her life seemed ebbing with every breath. XXII. Hark! there are footsteps sad and slow, Wending up the vale below! She roused herself to see the sight, And her spirit unfolded its wings for flight. Stay, lovely being, stay awhile, And bear thy Rollo's smile away,— Her spirit stayed,—alas! no smile Came from that lifeless form of clay.— That morn she was a maiden fair, But now the healthful flush is fled, Her soul hath been subdued by care, Her life, her Rollo too is dead. Why should that maiden still live on When all that made life sweet are gone? XXIII. The warriors bore their burthen near, But the maiden gave no sudden cry, No sigh escaped, nor e'en a tear Dimmed the clear lustre of her eye. Hath consciousness entirely fled Or is affection cold and dead? “Oh lovely maid thou doest well To heave no deep, no bitter sigh, Thy faithful Rollo bravely fell, It is a warrior's bliss to die! He named thee in his latest breath, Then closed his sightless eyes in death.” So spake the warriors, but the sound Died in a stillness too profound! All that they said alas was vain, She ne'er shall hear, think, act again. They little wot I ween that they Spake to a motionless mass of clay! XXIV. Oh she shall never, never speak, She cannot do her office now, But ye must bathe his bloody cheek And wipe the cold sweat from his brow; And drop for her the scalding tear, Upon her noble Rollo's bier. For her pure spirit now hath fled, To the peaceful land of the happy dead. And now her sorrow, and her pain, Her griefs, her troubles, all are o'er, Rollo and She have met again, Where their pure souls shall part no more. “But they two shall wander Where bright streams meander Near the mansions of Vingolf,—of friendship and love, And they shall bask in beams of light, And they shall be like visions bright In that glorious land above.” XXV. And ended thus the old man's tale Applauded by that courteous throng, He smiled, for praises much avail Each true and gifted son of song; He toils, he labours all for this, Praise is his food, his life, his bliss. XXVI. The Poet is a fragile thing, He cannot bear the cheerless eye, A smile,—and he will sweetly sing, A frown,—and he will droop and die. Ye careless ones ye little know The poignance of the bitter smart, The depth of that despairing woe That wrings the bard's too tender heart, When from his wild impassioned lay You cold and heartless turn away. Remember that his nights, his days, Are spent in toil to pleasure you, And all he hopes for is your praise, Then will you cheat him of his due? Nay,—grant him this and he is blest, Though cares on cares distract his breast. XXVII. But in that goodly company There now arose a noble form, Handsome and fair and tall was he And like some spirit of the storm; For when ought moved his wrathful ire His eyes would beam like balls of fire. Locks of hair black, curling, now Shade his pale marmorial brow, And it seemed as though some being lent A soul to every lineament. For he scarcely seemed of mortal birth, But more like a spirit than son of the earth, So wild were his features, so pale and so fair, So noble his aspect, so lofty his air. XXVIII. Otlauga had heard the old man's tale Till she sunk in a silent reverie, Oh! her lip is blanched, her face is pale, Hath her soul sought the deep, green sea? Her brow is resting upon her hand, And her spirit hath gone to another land: A land of visions, a land of dreams, Where happiness flows in silver streams, All bright as it springs up from its source And unmolested wends its course Midst sunny scenes, and golden flowers, Children of bliss, and happy hours; Where hope, and present happiness Combine their powers, combine to bless. To a land where every thing is full Of tenderness, love, and the beautiful. XXIX. But when that stranger rose and bowed, And when he spake in accents proud, She awoke from her dream with a shriek and a start, For that voice found an echo I ween in her heart. She turned a quick and timid glance Upon his noble countenance. Otlauga thought she could trace there The marks of grief, the marks of care. And but for these, he would have seemed Like one of those of whom she dreamed. Otlauga caught that deep drawn sigh, She heard that half suppressed moan, She saw his dark and fiery eye Was fixed on her, on her alone. Oh! is he a spirit come down from above, That his glance is so full of affection and love? XXX. Love and pity are allied, They ever wander forth together, And aye they nestle side by side In sunshine, or in stormy weather.— And though the haughty, handsome stranger Sought not pity nor relief, Still she saw some care, some danger Saddened all his soul with grief. And if ye think she was not moved Ye little know a woman's part; I say not that the maiden loved,— I say she had a woman's heart. And yet a strange romantic feeling O'er her soul came softly stealing, And Ragnar was forgotton then By those affections once his own, And now of all the sons of men, They are the stranger's, his alone. Oh! cometh this feeling from regions above? Or is it not pity, or is it not love? XXXI. The stranger turned him to the throng, And proudly bowed his haughty head; And seeing there the son of song He blandly smiled, and gently said,— “Honoured scald thou dost excel In melting numbers and address, And, aged man, thou knowest well To move the heart to tenderness; But if a humbler hand may try To bring the tear, to raise the sigh,— Lend me then thy sounding lyre, And while my devious fingers stray I will catch the poet's fire, And frame a wild, though humble lay.” The boon is granted, and he stands, The harp-strings trembling in his hands. XXXII. But ere commenced the stranger's song,— Started that simple warlike throng, Like a spectre from the tomb, Like the phantom of a dream, Round and round about the room With a whoop, and with a scream, Heedless of the glaring light, Flew the spectral bird of night. And many a warrior strong and brave, As the owlet flew on pinions fleet, Bethought him of the dreary grave, And saw I ween his winding sheet. And,—aye the pale cock 'gan to crow, In the palace of Hela in regions below. XXXIII. And still the owl her white wings plied, And round and round With a whizzing sound The night bird ever hied. And over head As she swiftly sped Her white wings flapped, And they clattered and clapped Like strong machinerye, Still round and round With a whizzing sound Thrice round the room flew she; And then her wheeling flight was o'er, For she sped away through the open door. XXXIV. They heard her shriek in the haunted glen,— Forsaken by the sons of men; And aye upon the fitful gale, Still were heard her whoop and wail As she sped across the fen. But suddenly all sounds were still, Save when the wind came cold and chill, Along the vale and down the hill. Silence reigned throughout the hall, As though the guests and warriors all Were folded in their funeral pall! But hark! they hear a step so slow, Trampling in the frozen snow. XXXV. It cannot be one of the sons of men, Abroad on such a night; And pacing thus the haunted glen Attracted by the light That burns in the wizard Rolfi's cave, Luring him onward to his grave! No, no, the glen is a place of fear, Known round the country far and near; It cannot be one of the sons of men, Awaking the echoes of Rolfi's glen. The night birds flit in horror by, Without a whoop, without a cry. The owl in silence whirreth past, And hushed and still is the midnight blast! Who is this being of fear and dread, That shunneth thus the light? Oh! is it a spirit from Niflheim fled, The soul of one who hath long been dead, That wandereth thus in the night? Those solemn footfalls, lengthened, slow, Trampling in the frozen snow, Break louder on the listening ear, Drawing nearer, and more near. And soon I ween A form will be seen,— But hark! that trampling sound is o'er, A being bendeth at the door; And, wrapt in mystery and in gloom, Amidst the silence of the tomb, He passeth slowly up the room! CANTO III. The Legend of Ragnar Lodbrog. “? Wherefore not vain, Nor yet without permitted power impressed, I deem those legends terrible, with which The Polar ancient thrilled his uncouth throng.” Coleridge. “? By night from dreams Of opening gulphs, black storms, and raging flames, Starting amazed. ?” Prior. I. 'Tis strange how o'er the most obdurate breast Fell Superstition holdeth magic sway, Producing causeless care, and sad unrest, Chasing the better feelings all away, And bringing apprehension strong alway.— And e'en to those who fear not danger near, There is a horror in those things that lay In doubt and mystery; superstition here Raiseth his hoary head, and worketh woe and fear. II. And in that goodly company Each thought his neighbour ill at rest, While from the plague himself not free,— He bore a burthen in his breast: And aye for fear scarce drew his breath Through lips as ashy-pale as death. But he, the cause of these alarms, Knew not fear, nor thought of harms, But like a spectre from the tomb He slowly glided down the room, And gazing carefully around, He sought for one he had not found. III. His gaze at last met the stranger's glance, And then athwart his countenance There came a ghastly smile,— That passed away the while, As swiftly as the meteors dance Across heaven's darkened countenance, Illuming yonder isle. And his features wore their wonted gloom As hopeless, as cheerless, as dark as the tomb. IV. O who can this aged wanderer be? He seemeth a man of mysterye, And his beard is as white as the foam of the sea. His visage is wan, his vigour hath fled, And he seemeth like one who hath once been dead! Oh! his figure is gaunt, and his skin seemeth thrown Like a mantle to cover the naked bone, And his eyes are as lifeless as circles of stone; And he who looks on them shivereth still, And feeleth I ween his life blood chill; And he is by a fearful sense oppressed, For a slimy snake seemeth coiled in his breast. V. Otlauga,—what aileth her?—pale as death, Without a motion, without a breath, Resteth there silent and alone, As cold and as chill as a marble-stone! For when that old man passed the door, She knew his figure I ween of yore: She had seen that form by the pale moonlight, Wrapped in the mists of the chilly night. VI. She had seen him stand on those rocks so bare, Beside the silent sea of blood; She had heard his voice on the nightly air When he spake to the being who sailed on the flood. And still when the night winds sighed and sung, Those words in her ears forever rung,— “I have found where she dwelleth, that child of the sea, Thou shalt see her I ween right speedily.” She had heard that voice when the night bird screams, She had seen that form in her midnight dreams. VII. But still the guests in silent horror stood, Till with a sudden start They felt the kindly long congealed blood Rush round their heart, And in its proper channels flow, With a pleasurable glow. For that old man had spoken In accents so kind, That the ice was all broken, As if with a token, That thrilled through their body, and thrilled through their mind. “'Tis strange how such a power should dwell With any breathing mortal breath,” “Hush! be silent! how canst thou tell That he cometh not up from the palace of death. But whether he be a man or no Time will show,—time will show!” VIII. “Say why hath all this fear, This horror thus come o'er ye? My messenger was here, I sent him on before me. He told you I ween with whoop and with cry” That his aged master was drawing nigh.—” The old man spake with a leer and a smile, And the owlet with its eye of fire, Sat perching all the while Upon his master's golden lyre. That was a wondrous harp I ween, And aye men say that it had been In many a strange and dreadful scene! IX. He turned him to the company,— That aged man of mystery, There was something in his glance, And something in his countenance Of pity and of tenderness, When his steady eye fell on the drooping form, The form of the lovely shepherdess. And as though the long, long gathering storm That dwelt about his gloomy brow Had quite evanished now, There came from his eye so cold and dead A bright, but momentary gleam,— Alas! alas! too soon it fled; Why hath it gone, did it give him pain? 'Tis quenched, 'tis quenched, it vanished Like the sun's departing beam, And all too soon alas! is night again ysped. X. The old man sighed, and then he spake again, “Thou aged son of song, I heard thy plaintive strain When it came floating the wild winds along; Though between me and you there lay Many a mile of weary way; Though there were mountains, hills, and vales, Flint-frozen streams, and ice and snow, Above, about, below,— Despite of these the swift wing'd gales.— But it were vain to tell you what you cannot know,— What if you hear you cannot understand, How the slight forms of air, To me their message bring, To me their wonders show And own me as their king. How through their watchful care I know the secrets of each distant land,— And have but to wave my wand And am transported there. To tell you this I say again, Would be a waste of words in vain. XI. “'Twas not for this I left my sea-girt cave, Where the winds and wild-waves sing, And voices numberless, On the rapt sense their music press Till the crystal arches ring, And dizzy, dance in wild excess Of harmony, and happiness. 'Twas not for this I trod the cheerless shore, And breathed the air of this unhappy earth; And not for this to those of mortal birth My golden harp I bore. Lovely maid I came for this,— To cheer thy soul with harmony; For this I left my bower of bliss, For this I came to visit thee; If thou wilt listen I will sing, About a wondrous man, Ragnar the dread Sea-King.” XII. The maiden started at the name, And the blood came rushing red like flame From her heart to her features fair. What causeth this? is it maidenly shame, Or some deep feeling without a name? It matters not,—the red blood came To her cheek, and rested there. Brightly her brow so bold and bare, Beamed in the lamplight's lurid glare, All red as the glowing evening air, When the flaming sun descends in flare In the bright and glorious west: Emotion thus painted her features fair, And fluttered in her dove-like breast. Until for shame or causeless care, She hid her beaming face, behind her golden hair. XIII. And two alone in that large company Marked the maiden's strange emotion.— Have you ne'er seen upon the stormy sea, How, when the waves and waters of the ocean Are dancing and prancing in endless commotion, A vessel answereth every changeful motion? And when the waves each other crossing Leap and fall in tumult tossing Dancing to the dazzled view, The bark,—whene'er the waters upward bending Are flashing, splashing, and descending Riseth still, and falleth too.— As though it had no motion of its own, But was ordained to undulation still, And bow obsequious to the tyrant will Of the wild waves alone. XIV. Not less obsequious, did the stranger's view Transfer from that fair maiden's countenance Unto his own, each blush to that fair image true. And aye it seemed as if he grew Out of her image; and as if he drew His sense of being from that fervent glance. But the aged wanderer watched these two, Until a feeling came again That had too long been fled. It came, it came, did it give him pain? For he seemeth like one who hath once been dead. Or was it the excess of joy That gave his too full heart alloy? XV. It swiftly passed away,—and then he gave The handsome stranger one much-meaning glance, Which like a chilling wave Aroused him from his trance. He knew that glance I ween of yore, Shivering he gazed full wistfully about, Till through the open door He quickly issued out. Fear urged him not, nor was it ought like flight, But yea he knew that old man's meaning well,— That wanderer of the night, That man of the mystic spell. XVI. The night was fair, yet from the vault of heaven The stars looked dimly on the world beneath, The stranger gazed around— It seemed as though the monster death Had set his foot upon the frozen ground, And with his noxious breath Had blighted all beneath the deep blue sky.— Around was one congealed expanse Of dazzling snow, save where the waters dance, And fling their ever foamy crest on high;— The stranger slowly took his way Along the margin of a deep ravine, Ice-rocks in wild confusion round him lay Like monuments of things that once have been, Around, above him, and below, Was nought but ice and frozen snow. XVII. And still the traveller his way pursued, Approaching nearer to the shore; Which in a small cape bending Revealed the waters nearer than before,— And still he heard the ceaseless roar Of the winds and waves, while from a cliff decending. Nearer, and nearer still he drew, Until the welcome spot Burst full upon his view. It was a lovely little grot, A wild fantastick cave, Round which the winds and waters rave. And from the sea there stole a little stream, Which filled the basement of the cell,— That might have answered well, As a home or a shell Where the sea nymphs might revel, and happily dwell. XVIII. Here, stooping down he entered, and unloosed From all its fastenings a small fragile boat, Which soon was set afloat. A push from the oar, and a spring— And he and the frail boat swing Right out on the restless sea; Merrily, merrily, merrily They dance on the dancing wave, They speed away together, Despite of wind and weather Far away from the stormy cave. Round them still the wild waves sing, Round them still the waters ring And ever restless, roar; Till they two can scarce be seen, Through the thin spray bright and sheen,— Moving from the distant shore, And sunk behind the waves, they can be seen no more. XIX. But in the hall the aged wanderer stood, His harp already sounding, And all in silence was that multitude The aged man surrounding. The sounds of his wild harp, too wild for earthly strain, Made a soul-touching harmony; Bold they were and full and free, Not like mortal minstrelsy, For they went further than the sense, And thrilled the heart and soul, with a passion most intense: Purging the very thoughts from base desire, And wrapping feeling up in latent fire. They were burning sounds I ween,— Not a human being stirred, Such a harp was never seen, Such like sounds were never heard. And never will so wild a strain, Break on mortal ear again. XX. Otlauga with a burning breast Betrayed her strong emotion; Her soul was by strange cares opprest, Her eye beamed fire in sad unrest, Yet past all sign of motion. She felt those sounds but she heeded them not, All sense, and feeling were forgot In one o'erwhelming interest, One strange involved commotion. 'Twas fixed, intense attention that thus made The maiden hold her very vital breath, 'Twas fixed attention that thus made Her hang her head, and droop and fade, Like the bloodless form of death.— And while the sounding harpstrings rung He pitched his thrilling voice, and thus the wanderer sung. PART I.—The Journey. XXI. What sight on earth so goodly As a merry ship at sea, When the winds and boisterous waters Repose in harmony; When from the heavenly regions The moon and stars so bright, Disperse the chilling terrors And the darkness of the night; When o'er the world of waters The good ship makes her way, And all around without a sound The dancing meteors play? There is no sight so welcome In all the world to me, As the mighty sleeping ocean And a merry ship at sea. XXII. The breeze was blowing lightly, And the sea-steeds scarce were prancing, But the merry ship, with Elfin skip Went o'er the waters dancing. Who would have thought that vessel That harmless stems the flood, Had wrought such dire destruction That it might have sailed in blood? That vessel hath a chieftain Whose dreaded name will ring, As long as men will listen, And as long as scalds will sing. 'Tis the fierce and bloody Ragnar, That mighty man who springs From Norway's line of warriors, And from Denmark's race of kings. XXIII. The dreadful son of Sigurd Skims on before the wind, The North-land is before him But his fleet is far behind. Why is his speed so hasty, What flies he on to meet, Why seeketh he the North Countree, Why lags behind his fleet? His fleet lies off the Frankish coast, To watch, but not invade, For there hath treacherous Harald gone For succour and for aid. 'Twixt him and mighty Ragnar The feud is fierce and rise, He strives to quell the feud in vain— With the feud will end his life. XXIV. In the deadly strife with Harald's sire Brave Sigurd smote the plain, And by the sire of Ragnar Was Harald's father slain. And since hath wily Harald By guile and treacherye, Seized Ragnar's rightful kingdom And forced him to the sea. How then can Harald hope to live Disturbed by no annoy? How can he strive for wealth and peace, How can he think of joy? In vain are all his efforts For the fierce and deadly strife, Will be renewed by Ragnar Till the latest day of life. XXV. 'Tis hoped the Frankish monarch Will not the plunder share, Nor listen unto treachery, Nor heed a traitor's prayer. The brave and trusty Soemund Hath orders there to lay,— And if the Franks should send their aid, To stop it on the way. And there rests trusty Soemund, The Sea-King's captain he, While the brave and haughty Raguar Hath sought the North Countree. And far across the ocean,— The mighty surging main, The Sea-King with his single ship Will soon return again. XXVI. But why thus with one vessel Does he dance upon the wave, While the stormy north winds whistle, While the roaring waters rave? What takes him from his faithful fleet Across the faithless sea? And why before all other lands Does he seek the North Countree? Oh! he hath had strange dreams of late, He sees a maiden fair; Than Nossa's self more beautiful, And lighter than the air. Now Ragnar is a wondrous man, And brave,—as brave men say, But this fair maid hath vanquished him, And ta'en his heart away. XXVII. And he with busy efforts Hath sought, and sought again, If he might haply find that maid,— The cause of all his pain. O'er many a land he's wandered, And when his toils are o'er, He finds his last as bootless As that which went before. Till from the stormy North-Land There came a maiden's fame, And Ragnar's wise seer Arngrim Hath said she is the same Who breaks on Ragnar's visions, So lovely and so fair, Than Nossa's self more beautiful, And lighter than the air. XXVIII. Now Arngrim is a trusty man, A wondrous seer they say; He would not for a world of wealth Lead the wild Sea-King astray. So Ragnar takes him at his word, And now unfurls the sail, He floats upon the surging flood, He skips before the gale. And now his fleet is far behind, And he is out at sea; He seeks a stormy distant land, The North-Land seeketh he. The Sea-King now hath travelled Full many a night and day, Still the broad sea is before him And the blue sky still is o'er him; Thor speed him on his way! PART II.—The Shipwreck. XXIX. There is no sight in heaven, or earth, or hell, More terrible Than the fierce stormy ocean,— Go view it in that hour When tossed in wild commotion It puts forth all its power.— How the fierce waters leap, and rush, and drive, As though in their wild fury they would strive To ascend high heaven, and rive From their primeval seat, the heavenly host! XXX. When like the frenzy of a dream, The shocked ear on the whirling blast May catch, as it flies past, The Demon's wild discordant scream, Or laugh of dissonance. It seems as though the furies of deep hell, Were all let loose to work their purpose fell, Their purpose of malignity, On man and all mortality; And that they love to dwell For-ever, in the turbulential motion Of the mad and foaming sea, the frenzy of the ocean. XXXI. Three nights, three days, the tempest fierce has lasted; And now the evening of the fourth arrives, Yet still upon the wave, That yawns before it like a greedy grave, The lost ship madly drives. Its helm, and masts were long since torn away, By the strong incessant blast, That ever whirleth past On wings of rapid fury through the air;— The seamen in despair Have long since yielded up the guidance of their ship To those fell sprites who sweep the troubled air, And dance and skip In the dread lightning's lurid glare. Now the mad ship would seem to rise, And pierce the misty texture of the skies: Then with a mighty crash It would descend, As though the bosom of the sea to tear,— Then with a start and splash It darted here, it darted there, To left, to right, above, below, Around, and everywhere. XXXII. The night draws on apace, And still the whirling ship— With crash and splash, with leap and skip, Maintains its dreadful race: Now on the mighty ocean upward bending, Now like the bolt of heaven descending. The seamen of that vessel once were proud, And aye they one and all were brave; But now,—a timid band They pale and shivering stand,— And shrink with horror from the cloud That rises from the boiling wave, This doomed to be their misty shroud, And that their fated grave. XXXIII. The current drove the ship one way, And the roaring winds another; Yet on it went, without intent Upon its path of woe, As swift as is an arrow sent From a sturdy twanging bow. Just then one pale and ghastly beam of light Came through the veil of the incumbent night. Whence came that transitory beam? It matters not;—it came, it came And rested like a bloody flame Above that fated ship, That onward sped more fleet than air, Upon its path of woe, its path of dark despair. XXXIV. And aye that light revealed A sight, that made the curdled blood As chill as is the stagnant flood, When by stern winter's frost congealed. As swift as passes through the air The flash from the impending thunder-cloud, Came thundering on its darkened way (Reflecting the red glare That ever lay Athwart the bleaching heavens,) Riding upon its chariot proud A mass of ice; a wondrous isle, Stretching from east to west full many a mile. XXXV. Towards its own destruction swiftly sped The fated vessel; while the crew Frozen with horror, silent as the dead Too swiftly grew To their own hearts, and courage tried, untrue. Wildly they gazed about for help,— No help was near. Nearer and nearer still, the island drew, And yea with fearful speed the vessel went, As though impatient, and in haste To be by that strange mass embraced,— Upon its own destruction bent. Between them and their fate still lay The dark and dread abyss,— The path o'er which they took their way Towards the land of woe, or bliss. Darkly the red light on the waters beamed, Darkly the waters to the red light gleamed. XXXVI. But he, the chieftain of that fated ship Gazed with an aspect stern upon the seas, As if in fierce defiance of the breeze, And of the dreadful waves that play, and skip In cruel mock'ry of man's woe: With folded arms he stood, And gazed upon the dark and foaming flood That boiled below. And with a firm unflinching eye, By the red light that blazed Far overhead, the Sea-King gazed Upon his own approaching destiny; Betraying no emotion, not a sigh Escaped him, but unmoved still He viewed the threatening sky; Nor winds, nor waves, nor powers of good or ill Could bend his stubborn will: He proudly gazed upon his restless tomb, Nor with averted eye surveyed his doom. XXXVII. With fearful speed towards the frozen mass, See the mad vessel o'er the waters pass, It comes,—it comes,—and loud the waters roar, Sea-monsters on their way Gambol and lash that sea without a shore, And gather round their prey. The wild winds whistle, and the lightnings flash, The heavens thunder, and the waters crash.— The seamen stood in dread, and speechless wonder, And aye they seemed to gaze with dizzy eye Spectators of a fearful destiny Awaiting others than themselves;—but nigh And with a noise like thunder The dreadful island drew; and then on high The shivered fragments of the lost ship flew; And one destruction whelmed, the vessel and its crew. XXXVIII. The tempest paused,—the mighty waves Seemed filled with horror at their tragic deed: But soon again, across the main Like the fierce champing warlike steed Upon the battle plain, (When its dilated nostrils scent afar The direful carnage of the sanguine war) They in their fury came again:— And leaping up to heaven, and thundering down to hell, They rose and fell, Darkling in ire, and rushing downward crashing The ocean's level under: Turbid and fierce, they onward darted, splashing, And with a noise like thunder: And still the tempest with incessant roar, Rushed o'er that furious sea, without a shore. XXXIX. A moment since,—two hundred beings stood Above that dark enfuriated flood; And now,—alas! for their ill-fated destiny They sink, to prove the dread profundity Of that inhospitable sea, And all, alas! are gone:— But what is that dark object? See How the black waters with fell swoop and swing Break o'er it;—'tis a human being; one Who struggles hard for life; 'tis he, 'tis he The terrible Sea-King! Fainting he clings to one detached mass Of ice, that down the current strives to pass: His chin already rests upon its brink, But how can he ascend it? See they go Riding to heaven upon the wave:—they sink With one tremendous crash, into the gulph below! XL. The mass broke from him, and away it sped; And now all helpless on the troubled sea Ragnar looked round him; hope, alas! seemed fled, And he prepared to meet his destiny. It comes, it comes! for, towering to the sky, And like a rolling mountain, proud and high, The huge wave rushes o'er his head. Oh! how shall he escape the waters? How Shall his existence be continued now? Far over him the swelling mountains rise, And threat to deluge the impending skies; Yet still determined not to yield his breath, Nor unsubdued, resign himself to death; Ragnar like one exhausted by his foes, Struggling, and buoyant, to the surface rose. XLI. Now for a moment on the liquid plain, The Sea-King wearied lay; When near him in its rough uneven way, A thundering mass of ice came on amain. He darted at it;—and with eager speed Seized it with hands whose frozen fingers bleed. Now summoning every energy, he tries To mount the slippery surface. The emprize Is one of life or death;—he mounts it or he dies. The strife was fearful, but the man was brave, And unsubdued in soul by wind or wave. He gains the surface with his vent'rous knee And baffles for a time, the raging sea. XLII. Proudly the Sea-King gazed around.— Oh! thus to be alone on such a night; No land, no country near, No friend the troubled soul to cheer, No feeling, sight, or sound Save what was mingled with the dread profound, No comfort but a tear! A tear,—a tear?—but no! A tear was never shed By that dread man, he may not show His weakness thus; nor weep for woe, Or aught beside, save for the dead! The dead may justly claim the tear, From those who never knew a fear. XLIII. It is a saddening thought That now his bosom rends.— Those faithful men whom he had brought Far from their country and their friends, Had fallen and perished, one and all, And not as warriors love to fall! 'Midst scenes of terror and of strife, 'Tis bliss to yield up breath and life. Thus had they fall'n their streaming blood Had proved their courage tried; But, swallowed by th' insatiate flood Like children they had died; And oh! he felt their shame to rest Like a dead weight, within his breast. XLIV. Just then behind a cloud, Like a pale spectre in its shroud, The trembling moonbeams fell upon the raging sea. It was a dreadful sight That burst upon the Sea-King's view; The pale and glimmering light Just served to show the horrors of the night. Above him hung a threatening canopy, But down below, More dark, more fearful, than the sky, And full of woe, Roared the terrific sea. He gazed around,—and on his sight Broke a chaotic world of leaping mountains, That, liquid, sparkled in the light Like sunnier fountains. See how he starts;—oh! sight of bliss, Another being dwells on the abyss! XLV. But he who broke upon the Sea-King's view, Alas! was not of his ill-fated crew. See through the air how gloriously he rides, And in his pride the tossing sea derides. Now up to heaven upon the waves he flies, And hides his person in the veiling skies. Then downward glides And in the ocean's bosom hides,— That seems to shroud him in his grave; Thus now above, and now below, He ever tosses to and fro, And dances on the wave: Approaching nearer, and more near;— It was a wondrous sight To see him thus ascend the air; His silvery hair Wandering upon the winds of night. More wondrous still, a sight of fear, That old man held a lamp, whose lurid glare Was that ill-omened light That hung above the ship in its despair! XLVI. That red light glared upon the flood That boiled below, With a lurid glow Like a convulsing sea of blood. And then a muttering sound Burst o'er the dread profound, Deep as a voice sent from an ancient sepulchre. “Frail man what dost thou here?” Broke on the Sea-King's ear. And over head he saw the lambent flame Dart here and there Its lurid glare;— And in a tone of mockery, A voice that issued from the sea Three times pronounced his name: And something whispered in his ear These words again “frail man what dost thou here?” XLVII. The Sea-King feared not death; And he was bold and brave; And yet he held his very breath To gaze at him who wandered on the wave. And in a tone far more imperious than before, A tone of dread and fear, That voice demanded “man what dost thou here?” “What brought me here shall ever rest A secret locked within my breast,” The brave Sea-King replied: “But if my melancholy tale May, man of wonder, aught avail,— I will relate to thee my woe, Provided thou wilt show On what dread sea I sail.” “Granted!” a thrilling voice replied, That seemed to thunder at his side. XLVIII. “Short is my tale, not so my list of woes” Ragnar began; “I who ne'er shrank before my foes Or mortal man, Have had a feeling in my bosom here, Too much like that which men call fear. Tis hard to war against the skies, And have the waves for enemies, Yet such has been my lot;— My business led to the Norwegian coast, Think not that I forgot (I say it not in boast,) To move the Gods who govern sea and air, By gifts and sacrifice and prayer: That they propitious, would my voyage bless And grant me what I sought,—success. XLIX. “I thought the Gods had surely heard my prayer, For aye the treacherous winds blew fair, Until the long desired land Burst full upon our view;— Its frozen hills of snowy hue, Its dark forbidding strand. Just then there rose from out the seas, Dark curling mists; that on the breeze Surrounded us full fast; Yet still we wandered o'er the sea, And hoped to reach our destiny Borne onward by the blast.— Vain hope! for through the mists, the light Like some half-spent, and flickering flame, So faint, so dim, and glimmering came We knew not day from night! Yet on,—and on,—as if by some mysterious helmsman guided Our vessel swiftly glided;— And nights and days and weeks have past Since we surveyed the North-Land last! L. “So long had we been on the seas, So long had bent beneath the breeze, We might have travelled where the Gods had birth, And spanned the seas that gird the solid earth. When on a fatal day The vapours cleared away,— Once more we hailed the cheering light, (Better have been involved in night!) For to our half-extinguished sight The black heavens told us of the tomb, The raging waters spake our doom! LI. “We saw we were alone, The habitable earth, far, far behind;— The seamen with a sigh and groan Themselves to fate resigned. Soon rose the fierce expected blast, And then the waves on high, Bore us into the blackening sky; And swiftly whirling past We saw huge icebergs on the waters cast And heard them crashing nigh: But dark as are the shadows of the tomb The mists came on again, and wrapped us in their gloom. LII. “Three nights, three days we wandered on our way, Still by the tempest tost; Our helm and masts were rent away We were already lost! And now the evening of a fourth arrives, And still our helpless vessel madly drives Towards the bleaching North:— The night set in with a roaring din As though hell's fiends had issued forth; A mass of ice came in the vessel's way, And she at once a wreck, all shivered lay! It was this thrice-accursed night, My own brave followers sank below; This night they bade farewell to light, To tread tonight, the path of woe! Of friends, of hope, of every good bereft I,—I alone, of all the crew am left.— My tale is ended, and I wait to know What, man of wonder, thou hast yet to show.” LIII. “Ragnar! and dost thou think” he said, With a stern voice and full of dread; “To hide aught from that searching eye That reads thy future destiny? And thinkest thou that aught can rest, A secret locked within thy breast That is not known to me? Go where thou wilt, let any sky be o'er thee, I tell thee King I have been there before thee. Thy tongue needs not thy purpose tell, For aye long since I knew full well Why thus thou sought'st the sea! And who I am thou soon shalt know, And where thou art,—short time will show, For a brief space farewell!” He said,—the leaping waves anon, Lift high their foamy crests,—and he is gone. LIV. Just then the heavens seemed rent in twain, And the moon shone clearly on the troubled main. Ragnar had felt a strange unwonted motion, No waves he had encountered, but seemed sliding Upon the surface of a tranquil ocean, And swiftly gliding. But when the moonbeams issued forth, To set himself at rest, He gazed to the south and north, He gazed to east and west. A strange sight burst upon his view;— “Is this a dream or is it true?” The wondering Sea-King said; The sky still held its threatening hue, The unabated tempest blew, And whistled overhead: Yet, swifter than the bolt of death, So swift he scarce could draw his breath,— Against the wind he seemed to pass Upon a lake of liquid glass. LV. At distance still, like a vast watery wall, The undulating waves still rise and fall: Far as his eye can reach, the waters rise, And leap into the lowering skies. But when he looks around, He views a black revolving lake, On which no waters ever break With their crashing, dinning sound. Close to the waves (had they been land, He might have leaped upon the strand,) He flew, and flew full fast; And when he stretched out his hand It cut the whistling blast. What was it that thus urged him on? He knew not;—but all hope was gone! LVI. Ragnar now saw that he was moving round, For his back was towards the moon; Then on his ear there broke full soon A distant, rumbling sound. Thrice round that lake as fleet as air he sped, While the wild winds whistled past, And the pale moon beamed far overhead,— Upon the scene he cast His firm unflinching eye; But his great soul shrank in his haughty breast, When he gazed on that unwonted scene, And strange, and unknown fears opprest His stubborn heart I ween. He saw that he was whirling round and round With dread rapidity; Approaching fast the centre of that pitchy lake:— And now a dire tremendous sound Broke on his ear, and wholly drowned The tempest of the distant sea. LVII. That was a night of contrasts; in the sky The moon hung out her lamp so fair; But down below, the storm raged high, And still the leaping waters fly Far up into the air. All round, the wild waves surge and swing, And threaten from afar; And wage a vain impotent war Against the fierce Sea-King, Encircled as he seems, within a charmed ring. But round and round incessant still he flies, And nearer to the dreadful centre hies. Just then a fearful thought shot through his brain, And in a tone of agony, He said “it cannot,—cannot be,— Yet to conceal the truth is vain; I am not now impelled by wave or breeze, Yet on I move with ease Around this watery plain. Alas! this is that place of dread, And I am doomed to freeze Beneath the chambers of the seas, And moulder with the dead. So let it be;—I am prepared to die, My friends have gone before, now follow I.” LVIII. So spake the dread Sea-King;—and now the sound That long at distance seemed, broke on the sense With such tremendous violence That the swol'n nerves, with throb, and bound, Proclaimed the power immense. On,—on,—and ever on he flies, And now he hangs right o'er the dread abyss, Now dances on the verge Of the dire precipice: Still he preserves a stern unruffled brow, Although in him hope has no being now. Hope is a thing to laugh at there, The Maël-Strom will admit, no feeling but despair. LIX. The Maël-Strom? aye the Maël-Strom,—'tis a name At which the stoutest heart, may shudder without shame. Down the deep vortex now the Sea-King whirls Beyond the reach of sight: He looks into the yawning gulph below;— And in that dread abyss of night He spies the red and glaring light, The harbinger of woe! Guiding him onward in his dreadful flight. But far above, those wheeling walls of water, Down which he hurries to the hidden deep, (Where haply his bare bones must sleep) Like a small speck of sickly blue, The overhanging sky Breaks on his dizzy eye,— Then vanishes from view. And now enshrouded in the deepest night Senseless he wheels his deadly flight, His pulse beats not, nor gasps he now for breath, As though already in the jaws of death, Entranced he closes now his eyes, Yet pauses not, but ever hies A thousand fathoms down;—into the gulph he flies. CANTO IV. The Tomb of Orvar. “The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze, And forms a rainbow of alternate rays.” Pope. Temple of Fame. “The whiles a most delitious harmonye In full straunge notes was sweetly heard to sound That the rare sweetnesse of the melody The feeble sences wholly did confound; And the frayle soule, in deepe delight nigh drowned.” Spenser. Faery Queen. “? O age, Where are thy graces, but in liberal deeds, In bland deportment? Would thy furrowed cheeks Loose the deformity of time? Let smiles Dwell in thy wrinkles. ?.” Glover. Leonidas, Book 2. I. The aged man had paused, and gazing round Marked the deep interest of the lady fair; How without any motion, sight, or sound, Her eyes seemed fixed upon the steady glare Of that bright lamp, that hung depending there. He saw the cold sweat trickling all along Beneath the curtain of her golden hair;— And smiling faintly on the anxious throng He struck his harp again, and thus renewed his song. PART III. II. Long time the Sea-King tranced lay, Till starting up as from a rapturous dream, “And she, alas! hath fled,” Ragnar bewildered said; “And with that strange unearthly scream, Swift as the sun's departing beam Hath vanished away.” And, as he spake he gazed around, And on his wondering sight, Burst a bright flood of light; And on his ear there broke a tide of mingled sound. III Then through his doubting soul, Strange thoughts, and speculations roll, When glancing back on his past history; And to his inward eye Appear again the raging sea, The ship, the men, their destiny, That man of wonder, and the threatening sky. And then the Maël-Strom and his passage down; The dreadful waters whirling high; Their fearful frown; And his own gradual stupor; and the cry That roused him from it;—to his inward sense Were vividly revealed, as with a light intense. IV. “And am I then a spirit?” Ragnar said, “And did I hear that oft repeated cry? Thrice happy thus, if numbered with the dead, I may behold, with an unclouded eye, That beauteous spirit ever hovering nigh.” Farewell ye smiling scenes; thou pictured earth; My faithful warriors; region of my birth;— All, all that once was dear I could forego, If to be near her were my happy lot: Come pain, or pleasure, happiness or woe, Her presence is my bliss,—it matters not.” He said, and gazing once again around, There burst again upon his dazzled sight, That glorious, and transcendent light, And once again his ear drank in that liquid sound. V. Never before had human vision seen Such bright unmingled splendour, as the scene Which Ragnar gazed upon presented to his view. Not like your paltry palaces of wood That glorious fabric stood;— Far, far above him there was reared A lofty ceiling, that appeared A roof of silver, glittering, bright, and sheen; Reflecting beams of light, Upon the wondering sight, In such continued and resplendent streams, That the fair queen of night, And sun more glorious, and more bright, Would in that fabric hide their darkened beams, Lost in transcendent light. VI. From blazing basements all of burnished gold, Thin spiral shafts of inwrought gems arise: What rich devices rare and old Break on the Sea-King's feeble eyes! The wond'rous capitals defy his gaze, And pour a stream of ever varying rays. The bright entablature, the cornice gay, Bask in the beams of one eternal day. The erubescent garnet, there is seen, The azure sapphire, and the jasper green; The yellow topaz, with its golden glare, And purple amethyst, all beaming there. But from the lucent roof, the pendant lights Diffused a radiance glorious to behold; Revealing strange unwonted sights Which never could be told.— Those lights, no earthly power could raise; No earthly power could quench their blaze! VII. “Where am I then?” at last the Sea-King said, “And if the boiling waters with their gloom Ushered me from the living to the dead,— This is my tomb! Where then if it be even so Are all death's terrors, and the land of woe? Perchance this is Valhallah? and yet here No feasting heroes, no bright arms appear.— Ye Gods where am I? hath my spirit fled, Or am I yet unnumbered with the dead?” He spoke; and shortly all around Seemed animate with music; and a sound As of ten thousand choral voices chaunting near Broke on his listening ear; Anon, the ambient air Throbb'd with a thrill of music, while he grew Faint with excess of rapture; and his view Presented to his mind a thousand figures fair, That seemed to flit before his dazzled eye, Chaunting this song, to their sweet melody. THE SONG. VIII. Noble man of mortal birth, Heir of sorrow, heir of woe, Think no more of what the earth In its poverty can show: Beneath the waters of the sea Care shall never wound thy breast, Peace and pleasure wait on thee,— Mortal, mortal take thy rest! IX. Fear not here the power of death, He may not enter to destroy; Drink delight in every breath Quaff the laughing cup of joy. What has earth to show like this? She hath nought like this to give? Drink then at the fount of bliss While thou mayest,—drink and live! X. While thou dwellest in these bowers Thou art free from every stain, Pleasures wait upon thy hours,— Pleasures all unmixed with pain. Drain the earthly cup of joy; Poison ever lurks below; And her purest pleasures cloy Mingled as they are,—with woe. XI. Here are joys to thee unknown, Joys, and charms that never fade; Not like bubbles overblown, Not like shadows of a shade. Joy shall ever be before thee, Love shall laugh and skip behind,— Pleasure's wing shall still be o'er thee, Bliss shall nestle in thy mind. What has earth to show like this? She hath nought like this to give; Drink then at the fount of bliss While thou mayest,—drink and live. XII. Just as this song died on the listening ear, There came a mighty rushing sound Drawing nearer and more near; Until at last the golden gates Of that fair submarine palace open stood; And then that bright and gorgeous light Became extinguished; and the deepest night Wrapt all the hall around. Ragnar started to his feet Prepared his coming fate to meet, When on his wondering sight Burst the red and glaring light:— And he beheld the roaring sea Flinging at him its foaming spray, And dashing round the gates impatiently, Like a fierce monster gloating o'er its prey. XIII. And while that red and boding light advanced, And on the angry waters glanced, The doors self-moving closed again,— For ever shutting out the raging main. And as the light approached, Ragnar beheld The aged wanderer of the watery plain; And he might view That old man's features, sickly blue, And of a pale and deathly hue, When the red glare Of that mysterious lamp fell on them. And his hair Seemed like a stream of silver on the wind, Curling, and floating far behind. XIV. At last before the fierce Sea-King he stood. “Thrice welcome to these halls” he said; “These halls that lay beneath the surging flood, Are open to the living and the dead. Living and dead, have both been here ere now, Yet none so welcome, brave Sea-King, as thou! But follow me,—mayhap that I can show Thy feeble sense, what thou mayest wish to know.” XV. He led him on through many a gloomy vault, Until at length they came Where twice five thousand steps descended, And polished marble was their frame: Above, the flickering flame Revealed the damp and dripping roof: It was a reeking rock of darkest gloom, Against the inroads of the sea scarce proof. And as they downward wended, It seemed that they descended Into the bowels of a yawning tomb; For damp and noxious steams came through the air, And hung like halos round the lamp-light's lurid glare. XVI. For hours, the two pursued their downward way, Threading the windings of this vault of night; When on the startled sense there sprang a light Issuing from the dreary vaults below, Like scathing lightning, blue and bright Upstarting from the world of woe. XVII. Now the last step they reach, and now they tread The echoing pavement of the marble floor. The Sea-King starts, oh sight of dread! Oh sight of horror, and of woe! A thousand skeletons of human dead Stand in a ghastly row: Each side as far as eye can reach they stand, The red torch glaring in their fleshless hand! “What meaneth this?” the Sea-King cried, “O heed them not” the old man said, “These harmless stand on either side, And wait upon the mighty dead. Between these lifeless ranks we go To reach the vaults that lie below.” XVIII. And so they passed between those ghastly ranks; It was a hideous sight To see the red and glaring light Dancing upon their naked bones, All bleached, and bare, and bright! But still they onward pass'd Towards the vaults beneath; And suddenly, there came a cold and chilling blast, Which met them like the noxious breath, Sent from the humid lungs of death, To poison those on whom it may be cast. On,—on,—and ever on they go,— Until at last The farthest of the skeletons is past, And they descend into the vaults below. XIX. The glaring light was but a spark In that vast chamber, that tremendous tomb; The space just round it was illumed, But all beside was dark, A vast, a limitless expanse of gloom. Above, could nought be seen, but a thick air Hung like a funeral mantle there; And all around Was inessential night, A weary void unto the sight A dreary dark profound. Still on they went, until at last They came unto a door, well barred and fast. XX. The old man drew the bolt,—a lofty dome Brighter than jasper, blazed upon the dazzled sight. The vaulted arches rang To Ragnar's martial clang:— And from the roof there hung a silver light, That shed soft beams In silent streams For ever burning bright. But the place was chill and cold, and the busy air Swept through the vault with a doleful sound; And ever, as he wondering gazed around, Ragnar beheld the steady glare Of the lamp, reflected in the shining niches there. XXI. It was a wondrous place I ween; And the roof, and floor, and walls, were sparkling sheen. Not brighter blaze the fields Of those renowned and golden shields That hang in Asgard's ever glistening halls, Than, burst upon the sight With a clear crystalline light Those icy, lucent, and transparent walls. XXII. “What meaneth this?” the hero said, “I can behold with an unflinching eye That fearful land, of horror and of dread, The darksome regions of the ignoble dead, Where spirits mean, in Hela's palace lie. And aye uncurtained Are things of deep and dreadful mystery, And aye the scroll of destiny Is by mine eye,—by far too daring, read.” XXIII. The old man spake;—“these walls through which are seen The dreary regions of the poor and mean, Are formed of purest crystal, by no power That may exist but for an hour! Look round thee Ragnar,—say is not thy breath Tainted with charnel airs, and damps of death? Where now thou art, this blazing room Is now,—nay rather was,—the wizard Orvar's tomb.” XXIV. “Two hundred years ensepulchred he lay, Yet was his body free from all decay. Two hundred years were past,—and he arose From his deep slumber, and his long repose; For his spirit had fled From the house of the dead, Despite of threats, despite of pains, Despite of Hela's threefold chains. For that wondrous wizard knew right well, A direful and tremendous spell, Which, were he but to name, The vap'rous halls of Niflheim fell, And all in heaven, or earth, or hell Would be consumed in flame. He told them this, and they let him go From that silent land of weary woe.” XXV. “His spirit swifter in its flight Than a beam shot through the depth of night, Rejoined the body sleeping in this tomb; Life thus infused,—upon his sight Burst the clear translucent light That, quenchless, blazed within this room. Proudly he gazed around;— And through the dark profound Ascended to his ancient halls:— No foot had in his absence dared to tread The mansion of the mighty dead; But, dome, and column, arch and walls, Were just as when his spirit fled!” XXVI. “He yielded up his vital breath, And trod the path of woe, And sought the dreary realms of death,— The dreary realms below,— That he might add fresh knowledge to his store; That he might search and know, The secrets of that hidden shore; And well, right well were all his toils repaid, He pondered well those mysteries o'er and o'er While in the land of shade.” XXVII. “He wandered here, he wandered there, And aye he wandered everywhere; He sought the ever-blest abodes Of mighty heroes, and of Gods.” XXVIII. “Asgard, Vingolf, and Valhalla, Each bright inviting, happy bower, With all the dreary cells below Were open to his searching eye, That read their every mystery; When from the world of woe Th' obedient Demons let him go, For aye they knew his might, they feared the wizard's power. XXIX. “He knew too of thy coming here, He sees the fate that hangeth o'er thee; He gives thee now a welcome cheer,— For Orvar stands before thee.” The Sea-King started, “art thou he?” In troublous accents then he said, “Who triumphed o'er mortality, Obeyed by powers of air, and sea, The living and the dead?” He straightway answered “I am he.” “But not for this I brought thee here, Look round thee Ragnar far and near,— For now the veil is rent, and thou mayest see Th' uncurtained picture of futurity!” CANTO V. The Mysteries. “Time is forever silently turning over his pages.” Washington Irving. “Oh wondrous change! what unknown objects rise, And with fresh wonder fix, my lingering eyes.” Young. Last Day. “Roderick it is a fearful strife For man endowed with mortal life, Whose shroud of sentient clay can still Feel feverish pang and fainting chill, Whose eye can stare in stony trance Whose hair can rise like warrior's lance,— 'Tis hard for such to view unfurled, The curtain of the future world.” Scott. Lady of the Lake. PART IV. THE LEGEND OF RAGNAR CONTINUED. I. Ragnar looked round him, and beheld (Strange sights!) the wondrous scenes of eld. He saw the two eternal elements, The vap'rous Niflheim, and the Muspiel fire, And that strange drop, the primal cause of things, That wondrous fount, whence life forever springs; That had its being ere the Gods had birth, Ere sun or moon was formed, or heaven or earth.— He saw the ancient Ymer from whom sprang The Giants of the Frost; Ædumla too, whose offspring Bore, became The father of the Gods, whose ancient name Will never more be lost.— He saw the world created, and the seas, And other things which time has rendered mysteries. II. All these he saw and many more, And then his anxious eye Scanned the dark things of destiny, And viewed them o'er and o'er. Presented to his gaze was every clime Through the thin curtain faint and blue, The rise and fall of nations he might view That had outlived their prime. There tottering states, there empires new, Came in procession strange, but true, And last of all the end of time. III. That was a scene of devastation dire. Snow mantles with its dazzling robe, The east, the west, the universal globe; And from the land of fire Issue the sons of Muspeil. See how the mighty ocean swells, And in his ship fierce Hrymer proud, Whose towering head can pierce the cloud, Against the holy Gods rebels.— Man slaughters man, and brothers brethren slay, Sons kill their sires, by fathers children fall, Thousands, on thousands press the downward way And one destruction sinks, one ruin whelms them all. IV. The ash Ygdrasil trembles, and the Gods Make ready for the contest; the alarms Have reached the holiest abodes, And Odin buckles on his arms: Thor grasps his mace, and now on either hand The holy deities determined stand. Strong whirlwinds sweep the earth, and from their base Huge mountains are uptorn; the quaking world Like a mad drunkard reels; While lowering heaven like a scroll unfurled Black with dark destiny, in ruin hurled, Strange signs, and wondrous sights reveals. V. The moon is swallowed up in night; The sun is blotted from the face of heaven; And swift as arrows in their flight, Leaving a glittering trail of light,— The half extinguished stars fall down. The ocean tumbles on the trembling land; And Midgard, that fell serpent, he Who scatters pestilence and death, And poisons with his noxious breath The earth, the heavens, the sea, Now drags his giant form along.— The seas pervade the earth, And the dire vessel floats. VI. Fenris is loosed from the fetters that bound him, Hate gleams in his eye, and terror is round him; Lo! his mighty jaws expand, And now unfold on high; One rests upon the solid land, And one upon the sky. See darkling in ire, From the region of fire, The demons of Muspeil rush forth;— The dreaded Surtur leads them on, His flaming brand Gleams in his hand, And radiates the south and north. The bridge of heaven is broken in their course, So vast their numbers, and so great their force. VII. At length they linger on the fated plain; And from afar The hosts of war Following the Prince of Evil they survey. Loke leads them on apace, And Hrymer follows near; Midgard, and Fenris join them on the way. And now the hellish host unite, To slay the Gods these fiends aspire; Loke with the sons of night, And Surtur with the sons of fire. And now th' united band Fierce and expectant stand, And hope to view the Gods appear, Yet hoping, feel a pang, a thrill of bitter fear. VIII. Meanwhile Heimdallar sounds his horn, And, echoing with the sound, Those halls that glitter like the morn, Reverberate around. The Gods and summon'd heroes stand, A brave intrepid and undaunted band, Till Odin gives the word; then on they move To try their courage, and their strength to prove. On, on they headlong rush to prove their might, They meet the sons of fire, they charge the sons of night. IX. Odin with his helm of gold Moves against the mighty Fenris; Surtur with his sword of flame Smites down Frey; alas! too bold, He, who Bela slew of old Lies now on the battle plain, By the mightier Surtur slain.— See Thor and Midgard meet,— That monster that had wrapped the earth Within his mighty folds, As though it was an hazel nut, A thing to play with, and of puny birth, Now bows to power superior to his own; And pressed by that strong iron hand That scatters thunders o'er the land, Life issues with a groan. X. But yet the poison of his heated breath Drank up the soul of Thor; and night Came swimming o'er the orbs of sight, That closed themselves in death! Odin now wages ineffectual war With Fenris, the fierce wolf. Alas! the hour is come,—the hour of death; Fall'n and o'erpowered by hellish might, His soul is quenched in deepest night, And Odin yields his life, out-issuing with his breath. The Demon Dog, that chained to Gniper's cave, Howled like a shrieking spectre o'er a grave,— The fierce dog Garmer, gnaws the plain, By Tyr's superior strength subdued; But he too falls, one sanguine stain Proves the dread issue of their feud. XI. Fierce Vidar, Odin's wondrous son, Now seizes with tremendous power The blood insatiate Fenris. Vidar, than whom no stronger treads the field, Grasps with terrific might the monster's jaws. The strife was fearful, but a cloud Wrapped them in its humid shroud And veiled them in from sight; Yet one tremendous groan, Told that the work was done; That Fenris was o'erthrown, Subdued by Odin's son. And when the cloud had pass'd away, And given the contest to the light of day, The fallen Fenris met the sight; His jaws were rent asunder, And wrapped in flame, and clothed in thunder, The unclean spirit fled, to seek the realms of night. XII. See Loke, and Heimdal, with ungoverned hate, Give wound for wound, and work the will of fate. Both strive in vain, to gain the equal strife, Groan answers groan, and life is given for life. Prone on the plain the two together lay, And now forever seal, their eyes unto the day. They mingle blood with blood, And with a single start Their life comes rushing through their wounds,— Their lingering souls depart! Darkness mantles all around, And silence reigns without a sound. XIII. Then Surtur grimly smiled upon the scene;— The strife was ended, The struggle was o'er, Gods' with demons' blood had blended Where it should boil with life no more! Darkly he turned around, And called upon his native element;— Straight at the sound, The ignited heavens curl in flame, The thirsty fire laps up the swollen sea And drains the ocean dry! The mountains crackle, and the world takes fire, Thick smoke ascends, the greedy flames aspire. Flame comes from the east, flame comes from the west, Flame comes from the north, flame comes from the south, In flame is all creation drest, Hell greedy opens wide its mouth. The hot earth rushes o'er the fields of space A blazing ball, a lurid mass of flame. XIV. Ragnar turned away his sight, Yet when he closed his eyes, He viewed the ardent flame of light, And saw the blazing skies. The glittering element with power intense, Shone through the folds, that veiled the orb of sense: Yet when he turned once more his gaze Upon the vision dire, And thought to view the spreading blaze And see the world on fire,— How was he astonished! an emerald isle Bright as its rival gem, In a kingly diadem, Answered the sunbeam's glorious smile; And a swelling and ebbing sea was there, And mingling sound in which was a calm, And fragrance from blossom buds, blushing and fair, Tempered the current of odorous air, Till it rushed on the spirit, a full tide of balm. XV. Here he saw a palace stand, Far brighter than the sun; Covered with the purest gold That blazed in many a glorious sold In Gimli's happy land. The Gods and ancient heroes meet;— This is the seat, the very fount of bliss. The virtuous here shall dwell, And bathe their souls in joy; And, robed in immortality, Forever sing The praise of Thor and Odin; They shall be From painful apprehension free, And joy to all eternity Shall clothe them like a robe. And ever they Through one eternal day Shall drink fresh pleasure in;— This is the seat, the very fount of bliss. XVI. He saw a dreadful hall Wrapped in the robe of night, Woe! Woe! To all who go Within its ebon wall! Dark streams of searching poison flow Around, within, throughout this fatal hall. And here is torture for the soul, And for the body pain.— Woe! woe! to all eternity. This is the seat, the very fount of woe:— The senses here are inlets, not of joy, But channels through which ceaseless flow Torture and misery to the deluged soul.— Here dwell all evil doers, and here dwell The direful demons, and the sons of hell. And here alas! must be their stay, A long, long night without a day,— The long night of eternity. XVII. This hall stands in Nastrondum;— Through its windows flow Torrents of bitter poison. Tossing to and fro, The accursed ever go, Drinking in fresh woe To that accumulated store, Which, like a serpent, gnaws their vitals. Terror without, and pain within, Grief and torture evermore,— Thus ends a life of sin! But surely they shall know Some respite from their pain? Hope has not left them quite,— Day ever follows night So joy shall follow woe? But hark! th' eternal fiat Responds in thunder—“No! Joy shall not follow woe; And they shall respite know Never! never! never! But woe shall follow woe Forever! and forever!” This is indeed the seat, the very fount of woe. XVIII. Then Ragnar turned away,—this dreadful sight Was more than he could bear: And something like the mists of night Gathered about his brow; and he might view (Through the vapour thin and blue,) An ever restless sea: And in this sea an isle, Fair Britain's lonely isle:— And on its rocks he saw a huge ship stranded, The crew meanwhile, Upon the shore had landed. And oh! what folly! sought with hostile arms To tempt their fate, by spreading war's alarms. Then came the scene of strife, While terror spread around Blood crimsoned all the ground,— A sea of wasted life.— But soon the strife was o'er, How could that little band, Against such numbers stand, As lined the hostile shore? Drowned in their blood, they darken all the plain, Cut off from life, like bearded shocks of grain. XIX. The warriors of that lovely land Are from the scene of warfare gone, And of that brave invading band One man is left,—and only one! They lead him on to bear the storm Of their dire vengeance, all alone; And Ragnar in that bleeding form, Beholds no stranger's,—'tis his own! He turned a keen enquiring eye Upon that aged man Who still beside him stood; Yet nought was said, till with a sigh Orvar the old began;— “Yes thou art right, yon is thy bleeding form, And those who wallow in their blood, Thy poor, misguided band. Ragnar hear the voice of warning, Hear, and be not madly bold,— Shun that strong, that dangerous land, Few that harm her ever prosper; Hear my counsel, profit by it, Hear me Ragnar,—I am old!— XX. “Perchance thy soul is satisfied With what thou now hast seen, If so let us depart.” Then Ragnar thoughtful sought the entrance door, But with a wondering start, He saw nought but the crystal floor, And eke the walls where the door had been. And when he touched them they were cold, And they shone bright, and sparkled sheen Upon his aching eye; But place of egress could be seen, Here, nor there, nor anywhere Right wonderly I ween! “And so old man thou mockest me,” The furious Sea-King said;— “But if I lose my liberty Thou too shalt lose thy head.”— Nought said the aged man, But from his cold grey eye A wond'rous beam, was seen to gleam, And suddenly to start; And fire shot through the Sea-King's brain, And ice shot through his heart. XXI. “Restrain thy rage,” at length the old man said, “O'er me thou hast no power; But if thou hadst, and I had bled, Mayhap had come the hour When thou hadst known contrition; and felt shame To blot thy yet-untarnished name For smiting an old man! One passage leads down to these vaults, And one leads up above, Yet are they not the same: But if thou wouldst thy courage prove, And win the maid thou feign'st to love As well as deathless fame, Then, Sea-King, follow me! XXII. “I know the maiden that in dreams Appears to thee so fair; Than Nossa's form more beautiful, And lighter than the air. And aye she knew me once right well, And oft upon my knee She watched the framing of the spell, To guard her infancy. Her mother is in realms above, Her father too is there, Yet oft in tenderness and love They eased me of my care; And, hovering round their lovely child, Sighed when she sighed, smiled when she smiled. These days are gone, for in playful glee, She took my magic harp, and sailed across the sea. XXIII. “My harp returned to me again, But its burthen was not there; And many an art I tried in vain To find that maiden fair; Until I framed a potent spell And drew her tender soul away; I questioned it,—it answered well And told me where her body lay. And then her spirit fled again, A life inspiring beam, And joined the body, free from pain;— She thought it was a dream. XXIV. “And as upon thy visions There breaks a maiden fair; So that fair maiden sees thy form As light as fluid air. And, Ragnar, if thou lov'st that maid, The cause of all thy pain, I tell thee that Otlauga fair Returns thy love again. Let this suffice thee now, if thou canst prove That thou art worthy of the maiden's love Right soon she shall be thine; For I may give that maid away; I am the father of her line, And I am her's and she is mine Until her bridal day. If thou wouldst view the world above That lies beyond the sea; And gain thy life and liberty, And join the ranks of love,— Then, Sea-King, follow me!” XXV. Then Ragnar with a faltering voice replied, “Forgive me wond'rous man, If aught in anger I have said Thy bosom to offend, For curses light upon the head Of him who wounds his friend. Such thou hast been to me, And yet I knew it not; But pardon my infirmity And let it be forgot. I love thee thou old man! May blessings light upon thy head, Thy head of silvery hair; For by thy strong assurance now I know I love no child of air, Nor one of Elfin birth; But a maiden bright and fair, A lovely child of earth. XXVI. “Oh! surely this is bliss to know, Yet thou hast told me more; Hast deigned the maiden's name to show, That sent to my heart a thrilling glow, That shall burn there evermore! And thou hast told me more than this, And if the other moves me This overpowers me; bliss! oh bliss! That lovely maiden loves me. XXVII. “O thou old man, whom my suspicions branded with my shame, Forgive me; and if gifts or aught Can buy thy friendship, it is bought At any cost, save that of fame— Nay frown not,—gifts thou dost despise, And what to feeble mortals' eyes Is gain, to thine is loss? Thou countest all beneath the skies As worthless, and as dross? 'Tis even so, and yet I knew it not, Thou art a wond'rous man! Yet with such love as children show To that kind parent whom they know,— Henceforth, in happiness or woe, In earth above, or here below, I love thee thou old man!” XXVIII. Old Orvar was affected,—and his eye Emitted wond'rous beams; As though a tender soul Dwelt in a cold exterior; and a sigh Or something like it, from his bosom came; And round his changing eye That sparkled like a ball of flame, A mist seemed gathering, and a drop fell down, A scalding drop, as though it was a tear. XXIX. This quickly passed away; and then he said “Thy love, thy gratitude, may all be vain, For on thy raptured eye, The azure arching sky, May never break again. There is but one, one only way, Between this vault, and upper day, And that is full of danger;— Many have entered in these vaults, But none e'er issued out! And didst thou not behold that ghastly band, Who, fixed forever, naked stand The red torch glaring in their hand? And these are they; Who, issuing from these gloomy vaults, Have perished on the way. 'Twas fear that ruined them, and it was fear That tore the living flesh from off their bones, And placed them where they stand. I tell thee now what thou knewest not before, Their dreadful suffering ended not with death, Well had it been for them if it were so;— But ah! their last, their quivering vital breath Was but a prelude of their future woe! And know'st thou what it is that in their hand Blazes an ever flaming brand? Thou canst not tell,—it is their deathless soul! XXX. “Nay frown thou not on me;— Vainly I would prevent, As vainly I lament, Their direful misery. For mortal fear was that strong power, Which robbed them of their peace; And human fortitude alone, Can bring them their release. A dreadful monster lurks below, Whose terrors caused their lasting woe: And vain is magic power, Against that monster fell;— Had he been open to a spell, He, long ere this good hour, Had howled a tortured fiend in hell.” XXXI. “Our way lays through the cavern drear, Where this fell monster lies, Th' unwary to surprise! And damnify with fear. Oh! Ragnar, have a care! Let not his fierce, his angry gaze, Work fear within thy soul; For, if it should be so, Oh! then tremendous woe Will, Sea-King, rest on thee;— Thine arm a torch, thy soul a blaze To all eternity! Remember much depends, Upon thy fortitude; If thou canst put to flight, This baneful son of night, Thou gainest life, thou gainest friends, And every earthly good.” XXXII. “And oh! remember, that to thee, A thousand tortured spirits look; And hope their liberty to gain, And be set free from scorching pain. Be bold, be brave, but be not rash;— For if thou gains't the coming strife Then all is gained, and thou hast life, And those tormented souls are free From torture, and from misery: But if thy soul give place to fear, The strife is lost, and all are lost,— Those tortured souls and thee. And thou art doomed to stand, With yonder ghastly band; And ever share, their deep despair, Their endless misery. The blazing torch will glow and glare Within thy fleshless hand; With a quenchless light the torch will flare, But thy soul will be the brand. Ragnar beware, beware, again I say beware!” XXXIII. Thus having said, the old man turned his eye (Oh! wondrous orb of sense!) Upon the tablets of the Sea-King's soul. He looked, and looked again, But he read there Nought like fear, nought like despair; But stern undaunted confidence, Unmixed with aught of care. “My soul delights in danger” Ragnar said, “Point out the hidden way.” Then Orvar ope'd an arched door, And having bowed his head He left the shining vaults;— For there the passage lay. XXXIV. But as he went, he cried “Take down that sword and shield That hang against the wall, For they have oft been tried;— All that they need is strength to wield, And fortitude to guide.” “Then they shall have all that they crave, Or I ne'er danced upon the wave,” The brave Sea-King replied.— He took the sword and shield, and leapt to Orvar's side. XXXV. The way was narrow, and the lamp burnt dim, As down the gloomy vault the couple wended; Broader and broader, now the passage grew, As farther they descended. Until a hissing on the shocked ear breaks As though proceeding from a hundred snakes. Louder and louder still it grew, Until the vault in strange accordance shakes, And on the astonished view The wondrous cavern breaks. XXXVI. It was a gloomy vault, no human eye Might scan its vast dimensions; and on high And on the right, and left, and here, and there, Was universal darkness; save the glare, The faint and feeble glare that issued from the lamp. The cave that hitherto was cold and damp, Became illumined with a sudden fire, And then a hot and parching air Drank up the moisture; a sulphureous flare Seemed towards the cavern's summit to aspire, And gave a ghastly light, and scorched the Sea-King's hair. XXXVII. And by the help of this strange light, Ragnar beheld the monster whence it came; Its dragon wings were black as ebon night,— Its eyes the sources of this ghastly flame. A dozen serpent heads, came sailing on the air, Some floating here, some floating there; And, ere the undaunted Sea-King was aware, They were erected round him; void of care He saw one larger than the rest Starting, advance its scaly crest, And fix on him a hideous stare.— He knew not that each glaring eye Had robbed a thousand men of breath, Had doomed a thousand souls to die A ceaseless, sentient, burning death. Nor knew he from those balls that roll, Two fiends gazed at him; and did wait To make him share their dreadful fate, And pour their torture on his soul! XXXVIII. He knew it not, yet it was even so. They tried his heart, but his heart was stone,— They could not find one fear of woe To let their deadly purpose in; And so they were forced to leave alone That heart that knew not fear nor sin.— Then wonder came on those demons dire, But wonder soon gave place to fear;— For Ragnar clove that head in twain, Then what with the fire that raged within, And what with anguish, fear and pain That followed their foiled attempt to sin;— That hideous monster black and fell Uttered a ghastly groan, That reached the deepest vault of hell, And shook its firmest stone. The monster's wings are spread To reach the land of woe, “Haste, haste, thou craven haste to go And nestle with the dead.” The monster clapped its wings, its dragon wings and fled. XXXIX. A moment, all was silence;—then a sound, A mighty, fluttering sound broke on the ear; And through the dark profound A thousand souls drew near. On rapid wings they urged their devious way, From realms of endless night, to realms of ceaseless day. And as they sped from pain set free They sang;—while long vibrations roll There rushed upon the raptured soul A flood of sweetest song,—a tide of melody. THE SONG. XL. “Sing, brethren sing! While these caverns resound, Let their dark arches ring, Let their echoes rebound, With the praises of him who hath freed us from pain, Who hath ended the dire demon's terrible reign. We held our spirit in our hand, A blazing torch, an ardent flame;— And we were harshly doomed to stand Until the great deliverer came. Oh! he hath come, and set us free From torture and from misery. XLI. And now Valhalla's joys invite, The banquet is for us prepared, We leave this land of utter night Whose woes we have together shared. We leave the earth, and mount above, To realms of happiness and love. Glad friends our swift approach await, And now in numbers closely press; And gather round the golden gate, To welcome us to happiness. Oh! praise to him who set us free, Who gave us life and liberty! XLII. Troubles!—torture not his soul,— Care, and grief give place to rest, Sweet sensations ever roll Through his calm, contented breast. May he never, never know, Present grief, or future woe. Oh! may that strong, that vigorous arm That freed us from the powers of night, Be still effectual as a charm, And struggle ever for the right. May vigour gird his mighty frame, And honor shrine his glorious name. XLIII. May he have a peaceful mind Lodged within a peaceful breast; And may his friends prove ever kind, Light his toil, and sweet his rest: Mighty in war, in peace at ease, A tongue to win, a form to please. Thus may our brave deliverer prove Each blessing of a generous heart; And while he tastes the sweets of love Oh! may he never prove its smart,— May he know harm and evil never, But joy in life, and bliss forever. Sing, brethren sing, While these caverns resound, Let their dark arches ring, Let their echoes rebound, With the praises of him who hath freed us from pain, Who hath ended the dire demon's terrible reign!” XLIV. The song in lingering echoes died away, And they who sang it, all had gone; They sought the halls that blazed like day And were admitted,—one by one. Then Orvar to the Sea-King turned, His kindling eye in triumph burned, He placed his hand on Ragnar's head, And as he proudly smiled, he said “Ragnar the glorious work is done, The fair Otlauga thou hast won, And I adopt thee as my son!” XLV. Then he who from his country was expelled, In silent rapture followed the old man; And oh! if human eye had power to scan The pictures of the soul, it had beheld A sainted image in the Sea-King's mind; A lovely vision, kept and treasured there, That, like a diamond shed a chastened glare, Throughout the casket where it was enshrined. It was thy lovely form, Otlauga fair, That, like the struggling beams of rising day, Tinged with a golden glow the dusky air,— And from his gloomy soul, chased all the night away. XLVI. And still the two pursued their downward course, Yet Ragnar heeded not the wondrous way, Till starting, when the wind with boisterous force Rushed up the cavern where their passage lay,— He gazed around;—and on his wondering sight Burst wild confusion; combinations new; And like old chaos and eternal night, Ere elements were joined, or parts their province knew. He stood now on the fearful brink Of a vast rock, that crunched beneath his feet; Should it give way, I ween that he would sink Till time should be no more, and soul and body meet. XLVII. Upward he turned his eye; then gazing down He saw nought but a wondrous element; It was not air, but air and water blent; And when the light stole through it seemed a dusky brown. Around were huge and wondrous masses thrown, Which were eternal, or of unknown birth; These seemed the world's materials whence had grown The milder forms of the exterior earth. Now on the rocky ridge old Orvar stood, And waved a wand athwart the airy flood; When up the dread abyss a shallop flew, Slight was its texture, and an ethery hue Its feeble colour; Orvar with his wand Smote the Sea-King; then motioning with his hand, He bade him enter in and prostrate lay;— And as thin phantoms light, they then pursued their way. XLVIII. Up, up the wond'rous void they now aspire, Swifter than the flashing fire Across the arch of heaven; Up, up they mount, still higher, and higher, Swifter than the whistling wind, When the world is left behind, And the clouds are riven: All is motion, motion, motion, One fierce continuous rush; and ne'er before Was Ragnar stunned with such a roar,— No, not when on the stormy ocean; As with the rapid speed of thought, they went Right through the strong, resisting element. XLIX. Up, up with a roar, and a tear, Through the infinite abyss they flew; With a whiz through the thick humid air, Went the shallop of ethery hue. The motion now subsiding, grew more slow, Now gently on the element they ride; As though a power from the abyss below, Upheld and urged them, on a placid tide. Then Ragnar started up; and to his gaze, Two brazen gates were given; that seemed to hide Themselves in their own magnitude; their blaze Was such as human eye could scarce abide.— Against these wondrous gates, the labouring tide Waged an incessant war; wave following wave, As though a hundred giants strove with pain To break the eternal barrier, but in vain. L. “These gates thou erst hast pass'd” Old Orvar cried; “But let thine eye be cast On every side. What see'st thou now?” Not veiling his surprise, Ragnar beheld a wondrous palace rise, Stupendous as the fabric of the skies. Its swelling towers, and spiral spires were lost In their own loftiness; from east to west This palace stretched, in one continuous line; Its glittering front, with glowing gold embost, Enroofed with silver, and in glory drest, Its grand aspiring towers, with gems and crystal shine. Upon no pillars was it placed; Foundations? none were there, But like the pendent earth it hung In the unyielding air. LI. Then Orvar leapt upon th' apparent land; And, stretching out his helping hand, He bade the Sea-King do the same. Scarce had he left the fragile boat, That on an ocean seemed to float, When down the deep it shot, to darkness, whence it came, Then Orvar with a look of majesty, Thrice waved his wand athwart the airy sea, When in a moment all was motion: From east to west as far as eye might see, The curling mist assumed a thousand forms, Forms faint, and fragile, beautiful, and fair. Spontaneous music shortly 'gan to rise, As though proceeding from th' impassioned air, Or stolen from the skies. Orvar surveyed th' enraptured king with eyes Laughing in latent joy; and cried “arise And quickly follow me, those maids the feast prepare.” LII. Then Ragnar trod again th' enchanted hall Where he before had roused him from his trance; Here heavenly voices on each other call, And forms half seen, half hid, before his vision dance. And these are they, who at the banquet wait, And thrill with music all the neighbouring air; While as they sing, upon the soul, a state Of bliss steals, like a dream, when joy is present there. All is enchantment, music, feast, and hall, Those flitting forms;—all is enchantment;—all! LIII. Soon were the wants of nature well supplied, And sleep came o'er him like a cooling tide Upon a feverish frame; absorbed he lay And dreamed dreams, as most men do beside. Sweet were his slumbers, till his soul began The arduous toil of the preceding day; Again in dreams his whirling course he ran, And toiled and struggled in his upward way. His labouring soul, forced out from every pore, The painful sweat; and now that ceaseless roar Seemed dinning in his ears, as on the day before, Stunning alike each avenue of sense; But see the change! his painful toil is o'er, And what a smile of winning eloquence Rests on his features now. 'Tis as a scene Grand in itself, but by thick clouds obscured, And curtained o'er by night; where nought is seen Of grandeur or of beauty, till the sun Rides forth in majesty; and with his beams Converging in their strength, pours forth in streams A glorious tide, a flood of golden light, Dispelling darkness, and the mists of night, And chasing every cloud, and blot, away; Giving each beauty to the light of day. LIV. 'Tis she he loves, who visits him in dreams; His good, his blessed genius that appears As if to check the current of those streams, Of turbulential passion, or of fears, That rush throughout his soul; and it would seem Th' approach of that fair vision was not new, For, oft when dreaming the appearance true, He trembling had awoke, and sighed “it was a dream.” LV. But see! although the vision leaves him now, A smile plays o'er his features; and his brow Is placid and serene; for hope is there, Low nestling in his breast; and consciousness Dreamy although it be in sleep, can bless The ever active soul, and draw the sting of care. Oh! he is happy now, a still sweet voice In whispering accents, bids his heart rejoice, “Because he loves no child of air, Nor one of Elfin birth; But a maiden bright and fair, A lovely child of earth.” LVI. Long in the arms of sleep the Sea-King lay, Until a chill came over every part; Yea through his very soul it seemed to stray, And, like an ice drop, nestle in his heart. A potent power it was, a wondrous feeling, That searched his actions, and mixed with each thought, And through the soul's dark avenues wandered, stealing Back to the motives, whence they all are brought. Mad with the pain, upstarting from his sleep, He saw old Orvar's calm, and cold grey eye Fixed motionless upon him; as to keep Strict watch and ward, and bid all danger fly. LVII. Pale were his features, but a tranquil smile, Transient and brief, illumined them the while; Like a pale, mellow beam of sickly light, On a cold marble statue in the night. For aye the hand of Death had rested there, And left those marks which he must ever bear. The eye that has been quenched in dayless night, Must still be dim, or beam with borrowed light. He that has ever trod the dreary way Down to Death's empire, and has risen again, Must, like a subject, own the monarch's sway, And still acknowledge his tyrannic reign:— And in his person, stamped by pain and care, Bear like a coin, death's ghastly image there. LVIII. “Look up above thee Ragnar;” Orvar cried; And as he spake, he wandered from his side. Ragnar who long in agony had striven, Upturned his gaze, and viewed the arch of heaven. The night-winds gambled in his curling hair, And joy seemed mingling with the balmy air. He saw the placid moon enthroned on high, And the pale stars gaze at him from the sky. “And is this too enchantment?” Ragnar cried; “Nay, nay not so, look thou on every side.— There is a power in nature, I confess, Surpassing all that art has ever tried, A power to soothe, to sanctify, and bless. That power is present here if e'er it be, 'Tis seen,—'tis felt,—upon this silent sea!” LIX. It was a scene where solace might be found; The deep blue ocean slumbering all around, Save where the chill, and ever playful wind Skimming the surface with fantastic bound, Awoke a sudden low, deep dreamy sound.— And then the argent sky;—one soft serene Of placitude and peace; the shimmering sheen Of the pale moon, and silent host of stars, All sent unto the soul a sense of joy, Of peace and quietude without alloy, For to the ear attuned, fair nature's harp ne'er jars. LX. “How came we here?” at length the Sea-King said; Old Orvar answered not, but shook his head; Then holding forth his aged withered hand, “Now gaze thou forward, let thy vision roam; Canst thou not see yon snowy tract of land, Bathed in the moonlight, like a streak of foam? That land is Norway:—thither is our way, I promise thee thou shalt behold her soon; Ere the bright sun shall quit the coming day, Before another night has reached its noon. That is the shore, and that the happy strand, Where from a troublous sea, thou and thy hopes may land.” LXI. Here ended then the old man's lengthened song, And round him still was grouped, that listening throng. But she, whom it had interested most, Seemed in a maze of recollections lost. Nor knew she that the wondrous tale was done, Till the old man prepared to haste away: And pointing to the rising orient sun, He cried “lo! yonder mounts the source of day; And ere two daily rounds he shall have run, The finish of my tale ye all shall know, Joy often ends what sorrow has begun; As past events, and coming time will show.” LXII. But when the wanderer reached the open door, The maid recovering called on him to stay: “Thou wondrous man, thy patience I implore, Nor be so hasty now, to speed away. Thou knowest not the interest I share In this thy strange narration; for I bear The name of her, the subject of thy lay, And I have felt the magic of thy song, Oh! had it lasted through the coming day, I should have blamed thee not; nor thought the tale too long. Little knew'st thou to whom thy tale was told, Nor that I was the subject of thy strain;—” Here paused she, for the wanderer's eye grew cold As if tormented with some inward pain. Yet was there wondrous majesty in that old man, Though ghastlier grew his features, and more wan; Till with a voice, deep as a funeral knell, He bowed his head and said, “maiden I knew it well.” CANTO VI.

But behold a fire in the cave of the hill, A heart reviving fire. ?” Southey's Thalaba. “Di lei degno egli, e degna ella di lui, Ne meglio s' accopiaro unqu'altri dui.” Ariosto. I. O woman fair, and art thou doomed to weep? Thou art no vision then;—no glancing beam Athwart this world of woe, and darkness deep; No lovely angel in this feverish dream Of frenzied life; to smile and make it seem More holy than it is; more pure, more high, And luminate it like a golden gleam Of purest light across a cloudy sky, For sorrow wounds thy breast, and care bedims thine eye. Art thou a flower in this world's wilderness? Then is thy stem bowed down by woe and care! And if thou art an angel given to bless, Why wert thou ever made those griefs to share Which man of sterner mould, is doomed to bear? Or if thou art of high celestial birth, Why wert thou taken from those regions fair? Why art thou not all smiles, and joy, and mirth? Alas! for thou too art, a weeping child of earth. II. And all day long Otlauga sat alone Communing with her thoughts; and in her breast, Where many a hope and peaceful plant had grown, There was contention now, and sad unrest. For she had listened to no idle tale, Framed but to charm the ear, and lull the soul With bardic contemplations; and control The mind to little, or to no avail, And toss it on a wild ideal sea;— This was a tale of life, and of reality. III. There hung a mist upon her past, a veil Which mantled it in doubt and mystery: But as the wanderer had pursued his tale The curtain was removed, and she might see In features fair, without a cloud between, The regions of the past, and each familiar scene. Joy filled her breast, she wept for very joy, As each remembrance dwelt on some loved form; Alas! for earthly bliss has its alloy, And mirth is mixed with woe, and peace precedes a storm. IV. Hope, doubt, and fear, were rampant in her breast, Each, waged with each, a fierce continual strife, For such is man, too easily opprest, And such the elements of human life. Sweet was it thus to dwell upon the past, While joy seemed flowing in a tide of feeling, Alas! the fairest sky may be o'ercast, And night will come, although in silence stealing, Hope, like an angel with a silvery voice, Bade the sad maiden's trembling heart rejoice. “Believe whate'er that old man said,” He whispered in her breast; “His picture of the past is true, Then why not all the rest? He is thy guardian god and friend, Appearing to relieve thee; Be happy then;—believe his tale, For why should he deceive thee?” V. “Hath he not opened in thy soul A hidden mine,—a wondrous treasure? The past now yields its plenteous store, Of sweet delight, and purest pleasure. Hath he not pictured too, the scenes, Where with light heart, and laughing eye, Thy days were spent in sportive glee, Thy early morn of life went by? And is not this a wealthy store, Of knowledge to thy spirit given? For knowledge dwells but in the past, As peace dwells no where but in heaven. Can he be any but a friend, Who thus hath ta'en thy doubts away, Removed the curtain from the past, And given it to the light of day; And open'd up within thy breast A source of joy, a source of rest? VI. And if a friend, believe his tale; And be at ease as reason moves thee: What can thy troubles him avail? Be happy then;—the Sea-King loves thee.” But doubt and fear, like two envenom'd snakes, Bask'd in the scene which hope had thus portrayed; And she, like one who suddenly awakes Out of a glorious dream, to find himself in shade,— Became immersed in deeper grief, Beyond the power of art's relief. VII. “He cannot be my friend” the maiden said, “Can I forget that deep, that heavy sigh, That form that seems already dead, And then the icy coldness of that eye? Have I not seen him in my midnight dreams, When clothed with horror to my soul he came; Have I not seen him by those bloody streams, And heard him mutter o'er my hated name? And have I not awoke with shuddering start, And felt his icy hand upon my heart? How can he be my friend? for even now I feel the fever playing o'er my brow; Which doubtless he with pestilential breath, Cast on me thus, to work my certain death! VIII. “He doubtless is the foe of all my name; A wondrous man he is, if man he be, And thus may know the regions whence I came, And be acquainted with my history. And—dreadful thought! he knows of my unrest, And sees the secret locked within my breast: And thus insidious, wishes to impart Poison unto my soul, in friendly show, He tells a tale to win my ready heart, And raises me by hope, to plunge me deep in woe!” IX. Thus spake the maid; until her anxious soul Wound to a pitch of feeling, for relief Brimmed o'er in anguish, like a too full bowl;— And tears gushed forth in tides, as from a fount of grief. 'Tis hard when pressed by grief and care, When sufferings force the bitter groan, When gathering fears induce despair,— To think, to feel, I am alone! No friend the drooping soul to cheer, No loving eye, no kind caress, No ready hand to wipe the tear, But utter,—utter,—loneliness. X. And if the world is nothing to the heart, It seeks its friends in phantoms of its own; As if these could alleviate the smart, Or fill the void, the soul feels when alone. This cannot be;—that heart is like a flower Torn from its native earth, and flung on high, Bleached by the sun and wind, from hour to hour,— That plant must wither, and that heart must die! It has affections which would ever cling To hearts congenial; and would intertwine, Like sister saplings at the smile of spring, Or like the flexious branches of the vine. But if these cling to nought but passive air, Soon must they lose their vigour, droop, and fade;— So fades the heart, when overwhelmed by care, It clings to nothing, but a fleeting shade. XI. Grief spends itself, although it may be deep, And sighs, and tears, oft bring a kind release; The soul o'erspent, will sink into a sleep, A dreamless sleep, of quietude and peace. So was it with Otlauga, when the gush, The first sad gush of feeling ceased to flow, No longer now the waves tumultuous rush, It is a quiet stream, yet still a stream of woe. Now there is time for thought; and now a glow Rests on her pallid brow, “it may be so, As hope hath thus portrayed,” the maiden said; “Then why distract myself with needless woe, Or bring fresh torment on my hapless head? XII. “But may I not, through magic's potent power, Draw back the curtaining veil of mystery, And read the events of many a coming hour, And scan the secrets of futurity? Lives there not one in yonder gloomy glen, Who, through observance, and through magic rite, Possesses knowledge, unpossessed by men, And sees the things, unseen by human sight. I will away to him at break of day, And he my future destiny shall show, Whether it glitter with a joyous ray, Or be obscured in gloomy clouds of woe!” XIII. Thus spake the maid; and thus she felt her soul Eased of its load, and of its misery. There is a power which man has at controul, To cast his burthen on futurity, And trust that this may soon reveal Some good, his present grief to heal. And thus Otlauga veiled by clearer skies, Where starlike hope, in brightening beauty rose, And joyful visions bless'd her raptured eyes,— Snatched from the lap of care, an opiate of repose. XIV. Sweet were her slumbers, and she seemed to be Cast on a land of paradise; a fairy isle, Laved by a joyous and resplendent sea, Where peace and beauty ever dwell and smile. And there she thought old Orvar's loving eye Was o'er her for protection; dangers fly Before that magic glance, as from the sun Clouds melt into the azure arching sky. All was delight and happiness serene, A land of wonder, and of sweet repose;— But now a pale and shadowy form arose, And passed athwart that fair ideal scene: No fear came o'er her, and no sense of danger, She erst had seen that form, it was the haughty stranger. XV. Amidst her own sad sorrows, and despair, The stranger's were forgotten; and yet now That she was happily released from care, And quiet was her soul, and peaceful was her brow, Her former sympathies regained their course In all their vigour, and in all their force. And now she yearned his griefs to know, That she might weep, and share his woe. How was it thus? and say why should it be, That she an interest in his cause should bear? Whence came that strong, and tender sympathy With his deep troubles, and consuming care? What was that stranger form to her? ah! know That hearts congenial, have an influence Over each other, hid from sordid sense; And share each other's joy, and sympathize in woe! XVI. That phantom form approached her now, Care in his eye, pride on his brow. And now his tender, fervent glance Seemed fixed upon her very soul, Until her blood beyond controul Mounted into her countenance. Confusion laboured in her breast, She dreamt that he the silence broke, And with it broke her peaceful rest!— For starting up the maid awoke. XVII. The dark grey dawn just then was breaking, Above the mountains far away; All nature's voices seemed awaking, To hail the glad approach of day: The maid prepared to haste away To yonder dark, and haunted glen, Where,—ignorance and terror say No cheering light, no timid ray. Breaks ever on the darksome den, Where he forever makes his stay, Who visits not the haunts of men! XVIII. She had not reached the chamber's outer door, When a fair child rushed in of aspect mild, Whose parents had been dead two years and more,— Thus was Alfrida left an orphan child, Cast on life's stream, a fair, a tender flower, Whose young affections withered in their bloom, With misery only as an earthly dower, And mournful hopes, that centred in the tomb, But a kind hand had seized the tender plant, As it went hurrying down the stream of woe, Had cherished it,—relieving every want, And shewn it that, which only love can show. XIX. Oh! yes Otlauga loved that orphan child;— One common sympathy bound them heart to heart, For both were beautiful, and meek and mild, And both had felt, life's deepest, bitterest smart. And oh! Alfrida loved her fair deliverer more, Than with a sister's love; for she could trace Feelings which oft had solaced her before, When her own mother smiled upon her face; And, with a childish trust, that ever throws Its very soul in utter nakedness On those it loves, in confident repose;— She loved Otlauga fair, the far-famed shepherdess. XX. But now she came in the full flush of pride, She held a secret which would force surprise; Half timidly she stole, as if to chide The buoyant triumph that shone in her eyes. Otlauga had been weeping;—and she knew Sorrow seeks sympathy, and lives on sighs, As bruised flowers delight in honeydew, Nor love the radiance of cerulean skies. “They told me thou wert sad;—I must not wake The echoes of thy chamber; yet all day I longed upon thy solitude to break, And steal thee from thy care, and from thyself away.” XXI. “I longed to tell thee who it was that came, And sang that wondrous song of joy and woe;— Hast thou not heard of harps as red as flame, Impressed like marble, on the frozen snow, Seen on the hills and in the vales below? Those wondrous prints were seen but yesterday, When the old man had wandered all alone Over the hills, his solitary way, Tracking the route and course where he had gone. Then this is he, of whom the minstrel spake,— The wondrous wanderer of the worlds below; Who ne'er was known on mortal sight to break, In all his wanderings, in this world of woe. None know that aged wanderer's name, None know the regions whence he came!” XXII. The fair Otlauga faintly smiled, Upon that lovely, simple child,— “Alfrida, there was one who knew that form, And I that one; for in the times of yore I have beheld him, clothed in clouds and storm; And often have I heard his voice before, Amid the tempest's din, and ceaseless roar, Of loud and thundering cataracts;—but how, And when, and where, I cannot tell thee now. For I must haste away to yonder vale, Yon gloomy vale, all silent as the grave, The subject of wild songs, and many a tale;— Farewell Alfrida fair, I seek the wizard's cave. XXIII. Stern was the aspect nature wore:—around, Hills piled on hills, encrusted in the snow, Loomed gloomily in the dim, and shadowy light; And in the hidden glen, far, far below, The cataract rumbled with an angry sound; And leafless trees, to the uncertain sight Seemed like gaunt spectres; for the mists of night Hung round about them, not yet rolled away, Before the chariot of the source of light, The source of life and joy, the glorious orb of day. XXIV. Otlauga took the trackless mountain path, Erased by long disuse; for none had trod Its winding route;—they feared the wizard's wrath, And aye it wended to his curst abode. Oh! blame this maiden not, that she should grow Impatient, 'neath her load of misery;— She had no refuge, when o'erwhelming woe Rushed o'er her spirit, like a troubled sea; When her heart melted with consuming grief, No hand was stretched out for her relief. XXV. But rather turn thine eye to heaven, and praise Thy Saviour and thy God; for when thy care Weighs heavy on thy soul, thou mayest raise Thy voice in supplication and in prayer, And God will bring thy soul release, And hush thy troubles into peace. Then let her tears be free from blame, Who ne'er had heard a Saviour's name; Of faith, of hope, of sins forgiven, Of present joy, of future heaven.— No ray of mercy, and no light divine, Had on the chaos of her spirit flamed; The countless blessings, christian, that are thine, Were nought to her, who ne'er had heard them named. XXVI. She was not taught to bow the knee in prayer, Nor cast her soul on the Redeemer's love; Nor, through the vista of long years of care, Pointed to realms of purity and love. She knew nought of that peace of mind, Which trust in God, and faith instil; The humble heart, the soul resigned, The will, obedient to his will. She ne'er was told of life's short pilgrimage, Tending to endless woe, or joys divine; She ne'er had read one page—one truth-fraught page Of that thrice hallowed book, thou callest thine.— XXVII. What wonder then that she should go astray, When trying to throw off her load of woe; Since none were there, to show the wondrous way, In which the wretched, and opprest should go? Then blame her not, if to chase doubt away She has determined, with unflinching eye, To gaze upon those mysteries that lay In the dim, shadowy page of destiny. Oh! call it not presumption:—blame her not For her soul's darkness, when no beam of light Was, or could e'er have been, her happy lot, But ign'rance was her plea, and innocence her might. XXVIII. Otlauga wandered on the narrow brink Of a vast precipice, a shelving rock, To gaze down which, would make the spirit shrink With a convulsive start, and sudden shock. For in the depths below, the dizzy eye In the dim light, no objects could descry, All was blank night, and hidden mystery. But far above, the wintry pine and broom Disrobed, hung naked o'er the rock on high; Whose jagged top, was hid amidst the gloom, And hanging mists, of the impending sky. XXIX. She now has reached the bridge; and from around Tall mountains here converge; and leave a space Narrow and dark, and of a depth profound, Widening and spreading to the mountain's base. So narrow was the crevice, at a bound The agile huntsman, in the ardent chase, Had cleared the yawning gulph;—but far below Was spread that gloomy vale, where in their cell, The wizard, and his wolfish neighbours dwell. And even now, in trembling haste to go Over the bridge, Otlauga, from below Hears howlings loud, and many a savage yell, Mingled with distant mutterings of a spell. XXX. Fears now assail her, phantoms rush around, And long she hesitates; meanwhile the sun Appears above the horizon's orient bound, Prepared his short, but glorious course to run. And now the mists before his potent ray, Curl down the mountains, rise up from the vales; Dissolved they sink, or melt in light away, As clouds disperse before the sweeping gales. The scene now stood revealed, a little band Of houses far dissevered, here and there, Besprinkled o'er that thinly peopled land, Where all beside, was barren, bleak, and bare. XXXI. The contrast now was strong, and marked, between The outer world, and that which hidden lay; A gulph of darkness, and a dazzling scene,— Black realms of bitter night, bright realms of blazing day. A momentary pause,—and down she flies, Down the steep banks the trembling maiden hies; Her resolutions urge her on; and now The mists close round her, yet unto her sight Huge rocks present their bold and rugged brow, Like giant bands to guard these realms of night;— Past trees and shrubs she hurries in her flight, Scarce seen amidst the thick and vap'rous air:— But in the distance, lo! a glimmering light, Casts on the weirdlike scene, a faint and lurid glare. XXXII. Right onward towards the faint and flickering flame Otlauga hastens with a trembling heart; Now larger grows the flame, and now more bright, As on she speeds; till with a sudden start She finds herself, before the man of night.— He was a man of reverend aspect; white Were his long flowing locks; and on his brow Deep thought and meditation sat; yet now A cloud came o'er his features, and a storm Of fear, or passion lit his meteor eye, That gleamed its lightnings, like a thunderous sky. XXXIII. Stern was his gaze, until a shuddering awe Became the master passion of his soul;— Strange! awe towards one so fair from such a man! “Maiden what dost thou here?” the seer began, “Thou art not come to spurn me? for thy face Declares thee harmless, innocent and mild; Yet art thou of a dreaded wondrous race, Who may transfer their nature to their child!” Amazement held Otlauga dumb awhile, Till, o'er her features, stole a truant smile: And summoning her thoughts, the maid began To tell the reason why, she sought this dreaded man. XXXIV. “No,—Rolfi no,—men say that thou art wise, Foretelling things to come,—of peace and wars; Thou seest things unseen by human eyes, And learnest wisdom from the silent stars. They say the film is taken from thy sight, So that thou mayest pierce the deepest gloom; And pass the bounds of mystery and night, And scan the secrets of the book of doom. Know then the simple cause that brought me here, Over the hills, and down the vale to thee, Was, not to thrill thy soul with childish fear, But from thy lips to learn, my future destiny.” XXXV. “Maiden why mock'st thou me?” the sage replied, “What can I tell thee that thou dost not know, Since he the dreadful! is thy certain guide, Who hath ascended from the world of woe? Did I not lately hear from all around, His awful footsteps, shake the solid ground? And did I not, upon the midnight wind Hear his much dreaded voice speak to the storm? Shrouded in mist did I not see behind, His sad and shrunken, but majestic form? Why then O maid seek me, when he is nigh,— The father of thy race; whose prescient eye Hath scanned each deep, and dreadful mystery.” XXXVI. Here he was interrupted, for a step Hurried and quick came hastening down the vale; And then upon the bleak and wintry gale A voice called on Otlauga; “where art thou My kind protector, where? all hail! all hail! Thou shalt know peace and consolation now.” This ceased, and at the wondering maiden's side The child Alfrida stood; her laughing eye Sparkling with joy, and bathed in latent pride; “Haste,—haste, the father of thy race is nigh, He now waits for thee near the placid tide.” XXXVII. Scarce had she said, when up with nimble bounds She passed the confines of the haunted grounds, Surprised, amazed, Otlauga sped behind, Her fair locks sailing on the morning wind. Now o'er the mountain, through the virgin snow, The maidens hasten with untiring speed; Hills they have passed, they tread the vales below, And now ascending, skim along the mead. Between two lines of hills, a mighty chain, They view the distant and untroubled main. And near the water, on the rocky strand, Unmoved and still, two lonely beings stand. XXXVIII. A fleeting glimpse;—and they are seen no more, The changing route makes mountains intervene, That hide the prospect from the rugged shore, And cast their shadows on the dreary scene. Still on Otlauga speeds; but who can tell The hopes, the fears, the tossings of her mind, Her gushing joy, transformed as by a spell To fear and grief, by doubts that lurked behind. And only you can sympathize her state, To whom like care, and circumstance are given, When on a crisis seems to hang your fate, And failing is a hell, but bright success a heaven. XXXIX. Still on they toil; swift speeding ever on, And now they turn the angle of a hill; A rapid glance tells one they sought is gone, While one,—the younger on the shore stands still. Otlauga gazed around—“I fear in vain We hitherward have come,” the maiden said; When like a spectre from th' uneven plain, Rose that old man who seemed already dead: He that so oft had haunted her in dreams, And seemed to have such dreaded influence o'er her, He who had stood beside those bloody streams, Once more appeared, and now he stood before her. XL. Her hopes were shattered! and the maid had sunk O'erwhelmed with grief, with terror and affright, But that old man approached and with a look Dissolved the clouds, that wrapt her soul in night. Surprized, the maiden gazed upon his brow, Where majesty was stamped by many a sign; His pallid face,—she could not blame it now, It beamed with joy, and seemed almost divine. Sweet reminiscences were in her breast, Of early joys, and quiet scenes of rest. XLI. And ever and anon a much loved form Would smile upon her, with benignant eye; In times of dread when fears would raise a storm, He would protect her till it wended by: Nor suffer aught to work her any harm, But from her spirit chase each new alarm, And from her bosom every rising sigh. Each childish whim, his kindness would allow, And join her pranks though care sat on his brow. And oft she wondered at his matchless power, When he raised phantoms up to please her eye; And wrought fresh wonders every changing hour, To win her love, and charm her infancy.— And oft in later life her soul would yearn To find her early friend, and love him in return. XLII. Her wishes are accomplished! for she sees In that old man the father of her race; All fears disperse, as clouds before the breeze, She knows beyond a doubt, that smiling face. How changed since last she saw him in her hall! No more that dreadful frown, that threatens death Dwells on his features, like a funeral pall, To hide the living smile that lurks beneath. No more with icy coldness gleams that eye, To strike the gazer with unnatural dread; That ghastly glare, that deep and heavy sigh,— All like a dreadful dream, have vanished, and have fled. Herself she could not curb e'en had she tried, But tears of joy with broken sobbings blend; As the fair maid in thrilling accents cried “Orvar,—my father,—friend,—my friend,—my only friend! XLIII. “Thine only friend?” a voice in deep tones said, And thrilled its meaning through the maiden's heart; Surprised, she quickly turned around her head,— But why that blush? and why that sudden start? She knew that voice,—and well she knew that form, 'Twas he whom she had fancied known to danger; On whom dark care had showered his blighting storm,— The proud, the haughty, and majestic stranger. Haughty and proud no more; for at her feet He suppliant knelt disdaining not to bend Before that fragile form;—their glances meet, As he exclaims “Oh! call me too thy friend.” XLIV. “He is thy friend Otlauga,” Orvar said; “Nay more than friend;—this is a happy day, For now thy griefs and troubles have an end, And bright, and cloudless is thy future way. Now maid prepare to hear a name of dread, But tremble not, or thou art none of mine, Yet at this name the curdling blood hath fled From many a stouter heart, and sterner cheek than thine. The sun of happiness with glorious beams Hath risen to cheer, and luminate thy heart;— Behold the hero of thine early dreams! Ye two have met, and never more shall part. Oh! may the holy Triad ever rest Your friend, to shield you with protecting wing; And grant that greatest boon, a peaceful breast,— My blessing on you both;—this is the dread Sea-King.” END OF THE SEA-KING.</field>
