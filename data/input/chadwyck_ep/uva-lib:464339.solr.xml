Miseremini mei, ye that be my frendis! This world hath formed me downe to fall: How may I endure, when that eueri thyng endis? What creature is borne to be eternall? Now there is no more but pray for me all: Thus say I Edward, that late was youre kynge, And twenty two yeres ruled this imperyall, Some vnto pleasure, and some to no lykynge: Mercy I aske of my mysdoynge; What auayleth it, frendes, to be my foo, Sith I can not resyst, nor amend your complaining? Quia, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! I slepe now in molde, as it is naturall That erth vnto erth hath his reuerture: What ordeyned God to be terestryall, Without recours to the erth of nature? Who to lyue euer may himselfe assure? What is it to trust on mutabilyte, Sith that in this world nothing may indure? For now am I gone, that late was in prosperyte: To presume thervppon, it is but a vanyte, Not certayne, but as a cheryfayre, full of wo: Reygned not I of late in greate felycite? Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! Where was in my lyfe such one as I, Whyle lady Fortune with me had continuaunce? Graunted not she me to haue victory, In England to rayne, and to contribute Fraunce? She toke me by the hand and led me a daunce, And with her sugred lyppes on me she smyled; But, what for her dissembled countenaunce, I coud not beware tyl I was begyled: Now from this world she hath me excyled, When I was lothyst hens for to go, And I am in age but, as who sayth, a chylde, Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! I se wyll, they leve that doble my ?eris: This dealid this world with me as it lyst, And hathe me made, to ?ow that be my perys, Example to thynke on Had I wyst: I storyd my cofers and allso my chest With taskys takynge of the comenalte; I toke ther tresure, but of ther pray?eris mist; Whom I beseche with pure humylyte For to forgeve and have on me pety; I was ?our kynge, and kept ?ow from ?owr foo: I wold now amend, but that wull not be, [Quia,] ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! I had ynough, I held me not content, Without remembraunce that I should dye; And more euer to incroche redy was I bent, I knew not how longe I should it occupy: I made the Tower stronge, I wyst not why; I knew not to whom I purchased Tetersall; I amendid Douer on the mountayne hye, And London I prouoked to fortify the wall; I made Notingam a place full royall, Wyndsore, Eltam, and many other mo: Yet at the last I went from them all, Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! Where is now my conquest and victory? Where is my riches and my royal aray? Wher be my coursers and my horses hye? Where is my myrth, my solas, and my play? As vanyte, to nought al is wandred away. O lady Bes, longe for me may ye call! For I am departed tyl domis day; But loue ye that Lorde that is soueraygne of all. Where be my castels and buyldynges royall? But Windsore alone, now I haue no mo, And of Eton the prayers perpetuall, Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! Why should a man be proude or presume hye? Sainct Bernard therof nobly doth trete, Seyth a man is but a sacke of stercorry, And shall returne vnto wormis mete. Why, what cam of Alexander the greate? Or els of stronge Sampson, who can tell? Were not wormes ordeyned theyr flesh to frete? And of Salomon, that was of wyt the well? Absolon profferyd his heare for to sell, Yet for al his bewte wormys ete him also; And I but late in honour dyd excel, Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! I haue played my pageyond, now am I past; Ye wot well all I was of no great yeld: This al thing concluded shalbe at the last, When death approchyth, then lost is the felde: Then sythen this world me no longer vphelde, Nor nought would conserue me here in my place, In manus tuas, Domine, my spirite vp I yelde, Humbly beseching thé, God, of thy grace! O ye curtes commyns, your hertis vnbrace Benyngly now to pray for me also; For ryght wel you know your kyng I was, Et, ecce, nunc in pulvere dormio! SKELTON LAUREAT VPON THE DOULOUR[U]S DETHE AND MUCHE LAMENTABLE CHAUNCE OF THE MOST HONORABLE ERLE OF NORTHUMBERLANDE. I wayle, I wepe, I sobbe, I sigh ful sore The dedely fate, the dolefulle desteny Of hym that is gone, alas, without restore, Of the bloud royall descending nobelly; Whose lordshyp doutles was slayne lamentably Thorow treson, again him compassed and wrought, Trew to his prince in word, in dede, and thought. Of heuenly poems, O Clyo, calde by name In the colege of Musis goddes hystoriall, Adres thé to me, whiche am both halt and lame In elect vteraunce to make memoryall! To thé for souccour, to thé for helpe I call, Mine homely rudnes and dryghnes to expell With the freshe waters of Elyconys well. Of noble actes aunciently enrolde Of famous pryncis and lordes of astate, By thy report ar wont to be extold, Regestringe trewly euery formare date; Of thy bountie after the vsuall rate Kyndell in me suche plenty of thy noblès, These sorowfulle dites that I may shew expres. In sesons past, who hath herde or sene Of formar writyng by any presidente That vilane hastarddis in their furious tene, Fulfylled with malice of froward entente, Confetered togeder of commonn concente Falsly to slee theyr moste singuler good lord? It may be regestrede of shamefull recorde. So noble a man, so valiaunt lord and knyght, Fulfilled with honor, as all the world doth ken; At his commaundement which had both day and nyght Knyghtes and squyers, at euery season when He calde vpon them, as meniall houshold men; Were not these commons vncurteis karlis of kind To slo their owne lord? God was not in their mynd. And were not they to blame, I say, also, That were aboute him, his owne seruants of trust, To suffre him slayn of his mortall fo? Fled away from hym, let hym ly in the dust; They bode not till the reckenyng were discust; What shuld I flatter? what shuld I glose or paint? Fy, fy for shame, their hartes were to faint. In England and Fraunce which gretly was redouted, Of whom both Flaunders and Scotland stode in drede, To whom great estates obeyed and lowted, A mayny of rude villayns made hym for to blede; Unkyndly they slew him, that holp them oft at nede: He was their bulwark, their paues, and their wall, Yet shamfully they slew hym; that shame mot them befal! I say, ye comoners, why wer ye so stark mad? What frantyk frensy fyll in your brayne? Where was your wit and reson ye should haue had? What wilful foly made yow to ryse agayne Your naturall lord? alas, I can not fayne: Ye armyd you with will, and left your wit behynd; Well may ye be called comones most vnkynd. He was your chefteyne, your shelde, your chef defence, Redy to assyst you in euery time of nede; Your worshyp depended of his excellence: Alas, ye mad men, to far ye did excede; Your hap was vnhappy, to ill was your spede: What moued you againe him to war or to fyght? What alyde you to sle your lord again all ryght? The ground of his quarel was for his souerain lord, The well concerning of all the hole lande, Demandyng suche duties as nedes most acord To the ryght of his prince, which shold not be withstand; For whose cause ye slew him with your owne hand: But had his noble men done wel that day, Ye had not bene able to haue sayd hym nay. But ther was fals packing, or els I am begylde; How be it the mater was euydent and playne, For if they had occupied their spere and their shilde, This noble man doutles had not bene slayne. But men say they wer lynked with a double chaine, And held with the comones vnder a cloke, Which kindeled the wild fyr that made al this smoke. The commons renyed ther taxes to pay, Of them demaunded and asked by the kynge; With one voice importune they plainly sayd nay; They buskt them on a bushment themselfe in baile to bring, Againe the kyngs plesure to wrestle or to wring; Bluntly as bestis with boste and with crye They sayd they forsed not, nor carede not to dy. The nobelnes of the north, this valiant lord and knight, As man that was innocent of trechery or traine, Presed forth boldly to withstand the myght, And, lyke marciall Hector, he faught them agayne, Vygorously vpon them with might and with maine, Trustyng in noble men that were with him there; But al they fled from hym for falshode or fere. Barones, knyghtes, squiers, one and all, Together with seruauntes of his famuly, Turned their backis, and let their master fal, Of whos [life] they counted not a flye; Take vp whose wold, for ther they let him ly. Alas, his gold, his fee, his annual rent Upon suche a sort was ille bestowd and spent! He was enuirond aboute on euery syde With his enemyes, that wer starke mad and wode; Yet while he stode he gaue them woundes wyde: Allas for ruth! what thoughe his mynd wer gode, His corage manly, yet ther he shed his blode: Al left alone, alas, he foughte in vayne! For cruelly among them ther he was slayne. Alas for pite! that Percy thus was spylt, The famous Erle of Northumberland; Of knyghtly prowes the sword, pomel, and hylt, The myghty lyon doutted by se and lande; O dolorus chaunce of Fortunes froward hande! What man, remembryng howe shamfully he was slaine, From bitter weping himself can restrain? O cruell Mars, thou dedly god of war! O dolorous tewisday, dedicate to thy name, When thou shoke thy sworde so noble a man to mar! O ground vngracious, vnhappy be thy fame, Which wert endyed with rede bloud of the same Most noble erle! O foule mysuryd ground, Whereon he gat his finall dedely wounde! O Atropos, of the fatall systers iii Goddes most cruel vnto the lyfe of man, All merciles, in thé is no pite! O homicide, which sleest all that thou can, So forcibly vpon this erle thou ran, That with thy sword, enharpit of mortall drede, Thou kit asonder his perfight vitall threde! My wordes vnpullysht be, nakide and playne, Of aureat poems they want ellumynynge; But by them to knowlege ye may attayne Of this lordes dethe and of his murdrynge; Which whils he lyued had fuyson of euery thing, Of knights, of squyers, chyf lord of toure and towne, Tyl fykkell Fortune began on hym to frowne: Paregall to dukes, with kynges he might compare, Surmountinge in honor al erlis he did excede; To all countreis aboute hym reporte me I dare; Lyke to Eneas benigne in worde and dede, Valiant as Hector in euery marciall nede, Prouydent, discrete, circumspect, and wyse, Tyll the chaunce ran agayne hym of Fortunes duble dyse. What nedeth me for to extoll his fame With my rude pen enkankered all with rust, Whose noble actes show worshiply his name, Transendyng far myne homly Muse, that muste Yet somwhat wright, supprised with herty lust, Truly reportyng his right noble estate, Immortally whiche is immaculate? His noble blode neuer destayned was, Trew to his prince for to defend his ryght, Doblenes hatyng fals maters to compas, Treytory and treason he banysht out of syght, With truth to medle was al his holl delyght, As all his countrey can testyfy the same: To sle suche a lorde, alas, it was great shame! If the hole quere of the Musis nyne In me all onely wer set and comprysed, Enbrethed with the blast of influence deuyne, As perfytly as could be thought or deuised; To me also allthough it were promised Of laureat Phebus holy the eloquence, All were to lytell for his magnificence. O yonge lyon, but tender yet of age, Grow and encrese, remembre thyn estate; God thé assyst unto thyn herytage, And geue thé grace to be more fortunate! Agayn rebellyones arme thé to make debate; And, as the lyone, whiche is of bestes kynge, Unto thy subiectes be curteis and benygne. I pray God sende thé prosperous lyfe and long, Stable thy mynde constant to be and fast, Ryght to mayntayn, and to resyst all wronge: All flateryng faytors abhor and from thé cast; Of foule detraction God kepe thé from the blast! Let double delyng in thé haue no place, And be not lyght of credence in no case. With heuy chere, with dolorous hart and mynd, Eche man may sorow in his inward thought This lordes death, whose pere is hard to fynd, Algife Englond and Fraunce were thorow saught. Al kynges, all princes, al dukes, well they ought, Both temporall and spiritual, for to complayne This noble man, that crewelly was slayne: More specially barons, and those knygtes bold, And al other gentilmen with him enterteyned In fee, as menyall men of his housold, Whom he as lord worshyply mainteyned; To sorowful weping they ought to be constreined, As oft as they call to theyr remembraunce Of ther good lord the fate and dedely chaunce. O perlese Prince of heuen emperyall! That with one word formed al thing of noughte; Heuen, hell, and erthe obey unto thy call; Which to thy resemblaunce wondersly hast wrought All mankynd, whom thou full dere hast bought, With thy bloud precious our finaunce thou did pay, And vs redemed from the fendys pray; To thé pray we, as Prince incomparable, As thou art of mercy and pyte the well, Thou bring unto thy joye eterminable The soull of this lorde from all daunger of hell, In endles blys with thé to byde and dwell In thy palace aboue the orient, Where thou art Lord and God omnipotent. O quene of mercy, O lady full of grace, Mayden most pure, and Goddes moder dere, To sorowful hartes chef comfort and solace, Of all women O flowre withouten pere! Pray to thy Son aboue the sterris clere, He to vouchesaf, by thy mediacion, To pardon thy seruaunt, and brynge to saluacion. In joy triumphaunt the heuenly yerarchy, With all the hole sorte of that glorious place, His soull mot receyue into theyr company, Thorow bounty of Hym that formed all solace; Wel of pite, of mercy, and of grace, The Father, the Sonn, and the Holy Ghost, In Trinitate one God of myghtes moste! Non sapit, humanis qui certam ponere rebus Spem cupit: est hominum raraque ficta fides. TETRASTICHON SKELTON. LAUREATI AD MAGISTRUM RUKSHAW, SACRÆ THEOLOGIÆ EGREGIUM PROFESSOREM.

SKELTON LAUREATE AGAYNSTE A comely coystrowne, that curyowsly chawntyd, and curryshly cowntred, and madly in hys musykkys mokkyshly made agaynste the ix Musys of polytyke poems and poettys matryculat. Of all nacyons vnder the heuyn, These frantyke foolys I hate most of all; For though they stumble in the synnys seuyn, In peuyshnes yet they snapper and fall, Which men the viii dedly syn call. This peuysh proud, thys prendergest, When he is well, yet can he not rest. A swete suger lofe and sowre bayardys bun Be sumdele lyke in forme and shap, The one for a duke, the other for dun, A maunchet for morell theron to snap. Hys hart is to hy to haue any hap; But for in his gamut carp that he can, Lo, Jak wold be a jentylman! Wyth, Hey, troly, loly, lo, whip here, Jak, Alumbek sodyldym syllorym ben! Curyowsly he can both counter and knak Of Martyn Swart and all hys mery men. Lord, how Perkyn is proud of hys pohen! But ask wher he fyndyth among hys monacordys An holy water clarke a ruler of lordys. He can not fynd it in rule nor in space: He solfyth to haute, hys trybyll is to hy; He braggyth of his byrth, that borne was full bace; Hys musyk withoute mesure, to sharp is hys my; He trymmyth in hys tenor to counter pyrdewy; His dyscant is besy, it is withoute a mene; To fat is hys fantsy, hys wyt is to lene. He lumbryth on a lewde lewte, Roty bully joyse, Rumbyll downe, tumbyll downe, hey go, now, now! He fumblyth in hys fyngeryng an vgly good noyse, It semyth the sobbyng of an old sow: He wold be made moch of, and he wyst how; Wele sped in spyndels and turnyng of tauellys; A bungler, a brawler, a pyker of quarellys. Comely he clappyth a payre of clauycordys; He whystelyth so swetely, he makyth me to swete; His descant is dasshed full of dyscordes; A red angry man, but easy to intrete: An vssher of the hall fayn wold I get, To poynte this proude page a place and a rome, For Jak wold be a jentylman, that late was agrome. Jak wold jet, and yet Jyll sayd nay; He counteth in his countenaunce to checke with the best: A malaperte medler that pryeth for his pray, In a dysh dare he rush at the rypest; Dremyng in dumpys to wrangyll and to wrest: He fyndeth a proporcyon in his prycke songe, To drynk at a draught a larg and a long. Nay, iape not with hym, he is no small fole, It is a solemnpne syre and a solayne; For lordes and ladyes lerne at his scole; He techyth them so wysely to solf and to fayne, That neyther they synge wel prycke songe nor playne: Thys docter Deuyas commensyd in a cart, A master, a mynstrell, a fydler, a farte. What though ye can cownter Custodi nos? As well it becomyth yow, a parysh towne clarke, To syng Sospitati dedit ægros: Yet bere ye not to bold, to braule ne to bark At me, that medeled nothyng with youre wark: Correct fyrst thy self; walk, and be nought! Deme what thou lyst, thou knowyst not my thought. A prouerbe of old, say well or be styll: Ye are to vnhappy occasyons to fynde Vppon me to clater, or els to say yll. Now haue I shewyd you part of your proud mynde; Take thys in worth, the best is behynde. Wryten at Croydon by Crowland in the Clay, On Candelmas euyn, the Kalendas of May. SKELTON LAUREAT, Vppon a deedmans hed, that was sent to hym from an honorable jentyllwoman for a token, deuysyd this gostly medytacyon in Englysh couenable, in sentence comendable, lamentable, lacrymable, profytable for the soule. Youre vgly tokyn My mynd hath brokyn From worldly lust; For I haue dyscust We ar but dust, And dy we must. It is generall To be mortall: I haue well espyde No man may hym hyde From Deth holow eyed, With synnews wyderyd, With bonys shyderyd, With hys worme etyn maw, And his gastly jaw Gaspyng asyde, Nakyd of hyde, Neyther flesh nor fell. Then, by my councell, Loke that ye spell Well thys gospell: For wher so we dwell Deth wyll us qwell, And with us mell. For all oure pamperde paunchys, Ther may no fraunchys, Nor worldly blys, Redeme vs from this: Oure days be datyd, To be chekmatyd With drawttys of deth, Stoppyng oure breth; Oure eyen synkyng, Oure bodys stynkyng, Oure gummys grynnyng, Oure soulys brynnyng. To whom, then, shall we sew, For to haue rescew, But to swete Jesu, On vs then for to rew? O goodly chyld Of Mary mylde, Then be oure shylde! That we be not exyld To the dyne dale Of boteles bale, Nor to the lake Of fendys blake. But graunt vs grace To se thy face, And to purchace Thyne heuenly place, And thy palace, Full of solace, Aboue the sky, That is so hy; Eternally To beholde and se The Trynyte! Amen. Myrres vous y. [Womanhod, wanton, ye want] Womanhod, wanton, ye want; Youre medelyng, mastres, is manerles; Plente of yll, of goodnes skant, Ye rayll at ryot, recheles: To prayse youre porte it is nedeles; For all your draffe yet and youre dreggys, As well borne as ye full oft tyme beggys. Why so koy and full of skorne? Myne horse is sold, I wene, you say; My new furryd gowne, when it is worne, Put vp youre purs, ye shall non pay. By crede, I trust to se the day, As proud a pohen as ye sprede, Of me and other ye may haue nede. Though angelyk be youre smylyng, Yet is youre tong an adders tayle, Full lyke a scorpyon styngyng All those by whom ye haue auayle: Good mastres, Anne, there ye do shayle: What prate ye, praty pyggysny? I truste to quyte you or I dy. Youre key is mete for euery lok, Youre key is commen and hangyth owte; Youre key is redy, we nede not knok, Nor stand long wrestyng there aboute; Of youre doregate ye haue no doute: But one thyng is, that ye be lewde: Holde youre tong now, all beshrewde!

Ly styll, quod she, my paramoure, Ly styll hardely, and take a nap. Hys hed was heuy, such was his hap, All drowsy dremyng, dround in slepe, That of hys loue he toke no kepe, With, Hey, lullay, &amp;c. With ba, ba, ba, and bas, bas, bas, She cheryshed hym both cheke and chyn, That he wyst neuer where he was; He had forgoten all dedely syn. He wantyd wyt her loue to wyn: He trusted her payment, and lost all hys pray: She left hym slepying, and stale away, Wyth, Hey, lullay, &amp;c. The ryuers rowth, the waters wan, She sparyd not, to wete her fete; She wadyd ouer, she found a man That halsyd her hartely and kyst her swete: Thus after her cold she cought a hete. My lefe, she sayd, rowtyth in hys bed; I wys he hath an heuy hed, Wyth, Hey, lullay, &amp;c. What dremyst thou, drunchard, drousy pate! Thy lust and lykyng is from thé gone; Thou blynkerd blowboll, thou wakyst to late, Behold, thou lyeste, luggard, alone! Well may thou sygh, well may thou grone, To dele wyth her so cowardly: I wys, powle hachet, she bleryd thyne I. Qd Skelton, laureate. [The auncient acquaintance, madam, betwen vs twayn] The auncient acquaintance, madam, betwen vs twayn, The famylyaryte, the formar dalyaunce, Causyth me that I can not myself refrayne But that I must wryte for my plesaunt pastaunce: Remembryng your passying goodly countenaunce, Your goodly port, your bewteous visage, Ye may be countyd comfort of all corage. Of all your feturs fauorable to make tru discripcion, I am insuffycyent to make such enterpryse; For thus dare I say, without [con]tradiccyon, That dame Menolope was neuer half so wyse: Yet so it is that a rumer begynnyth for to ryse, How in good horsmen ye set your hole delyght, And haue forgoten your old trew louyng knyght. Wyth bound and rebound, bounsyngly take vp Hys jentyll curtoyl, and set nowght by small naggys! Spur vp at the hynder gyrth, with, Gup, morell, gup! With, Jayst ye, jenet of Spayne, for your tayll waggys! Ye cast all your corage vppon such courtly haggys. Haue in sergeaunt ferrour, myne horse behynd is bare; He rydeth well the horse, but he rydeth better the mare. Ware, ware, the mare wynsyth wyth her wanton hele! She kykyth with her kalkyns and keylyth with a clench; She goyth wyde behynde, and hewyth neuer a dele: Ware gallyng in the widders, ware of that wrenche! It is perlous for a horseman to dyg in the trenche. Thys greuyth your husband, that ryght jentyll knyght, And so with youre seruantys he fersly doth fyght. So fersly he fytyth, his mynde is so fell, That he dryuyth them doune with dyntes on ther day wach; He bresyth theyr braynpannys and makyth them to swell, Theyre browys all to-brokyn, such clappys they cach; Whose jalawsy malycyous makyth them to lepe the hach; By theyr conusaunce knowing how they serue a wily py: Ask all your neybours whether that I ly. It can be no counsell that is cryed at the cros: For youre jentyll husband sorowfull am I; How be it, he is not furst hath had a los: Aduertysyng you, madame, to warke more secretly, Let not all the world make an owtcry; Play fayre play, madame, and loke ye play clene, Or ells with gret shame your game wylbe sene.

You I assure, absens is my fo, My dedely wo, my paynfull heuynes; And if ye lyst to know the cause why so, Open myne hart, beholde my mynde expres: I wold ye coud! then shuld ye se, mastres, How there nys thynge that I couet so fayne As to enbrace you in myne armys twayne. Nothynge yerthly to me more desyrous Than to beholde youre bewteouse countenaunce: But, hatefull absens, to me so enuyous, Though thou withdraw me from her by long dystaunce, Yet shall she neuer oute of remembraunce; For I haue grauyd her wythin the secret wall Of my trew hart, to loue her best of all!

[Though ye suppose all jeperdys ar paste] Though ye suppose all jeperdys ar paste, And all is done that ye lokyd for before, Ware yet, I rede you, of Fortunes dowble cast, For one fals poynt she is wont to kepe in store, And vnder the fell oft festered is the sore: That when ye thynke all daunger for to pas, Ware of the lesard lyeth lurkyng in the gras. Qd Skelton, laureat. [Go, pytyous hart, rasyd with dedly wo] Go, pytyous hart, rasyd with dedly wo, Persyd with payn, bleding with wondes smart, Bewayle thy fortune, with vaynys wan and blo. O Fortune vnfrendly, Fortune vnkynde thow art, To be so cruell and so ouerthwart, To suffer me so carefull to endure, That wher I loue best I dare not dyscure! One ther is, and euer one shalbe, For whose sake my hart is sore dyseasyd; For whose loue, welcom dysease to me! I am content so all partys be pleasyd: Yet, and God wold, I wold my payne were easyd! But Fortune enforsyth me so carefully to endure, That where I loue best I dare not dyscure. Skelton, laureat, At the instance of a nobyll lady. MANERLY MARGERY MYLK AND ALE.

HERE BEGYNNETH A LYTELL TREATYSE, NAMED THE BOWGE OF COURTE. THE PROLOGUE TO THE BOWGE OF COURTE. In autumpne, whan the sonne in Virgine By radyante hete enryped hath our corne; Whan Luna, full of mutabylyte, As emperes the dyademe hath worne Of our pole artyke, smylynge halfe in scorne At our foly and our vnstedfastnesse; The tyme whan Mars to werre hym dyde dres; I, callynge to mynde the greate auctoryte Of poetes olde, whyche full craftely, Vnder as couerte termes as coude be, Can touche a trouth and cloke it subtylly Wyth fresshe vtteraunce full sentencyously; Dyuerse in style, some spared not vyce to wryte, Some of moralyte nobly dyde endyte; Wherby I rede theyr renome and theyr fame Maye neuer dye, bute euermore endure: I was sore moued to aforce the same, But Ignoraunce full soone dyde me dyscure, And shewed that in this arte I was not sure; For to illumyne, she sayde, I was to dulle, Auysynge me my penne alwaye to pulle, And not wryte; for he so wyll atteyne Excedynge ferther than his connynge is, His hede maye be harde, but feble is his brayne, Yet haue I knowen suche er this; But of reproche surely he maye not mys, That clymmeth hyer than he may fotynge haue; What and he slyde downe, who shall hym saue? Thus vp and down my mynde was drawen and cast, That I ne wyste what to do was beste; So sore enwered, that I was at the laste Enforsed to slepe and for to take some reste; And to lye downe as soone as I me dreste, At Harwyche Porte slumbrynge as I laye, In myne hostes house, called Powers Keye, Methoughte I sawe a shyppe, goodly of sayle, Come saylynge forth into that hauen brood, Her takelynge ryche and of hye apparayle: She kyste an anker, and there she laye at rode. Marchauntes her borded to see what she had lode: Therein they founde royall marchaundyse, Fraghted with plesure of what ye coude deuyse. But than I thoughte I woulde not dwell behynde; Amonge all other I put myselfe in prece. Than there coude I none aquentaunce fynde: There was moche noyse; anone one cryed, Cese! Sharpely commaundynge eche man holde hys pece: Maysters, he sayde, the shyp that ye here see, The Bowge of Courte it hyghte for certeynte: The owner therof is lady of estate, Whoos name to tell is dame Saunce-pere; Her marchaundyse is ryche and fortunate, But who wyll haue it muste paye therfore dere; This royall chaffre that is shypped here Is called Fauore, to stonde in her good grace. Than sholde ye see there pressynge in a pace Of one and other that wolde this lady see; Whiche sat behynde a traues of sylke fyne, Of golde of tessew the fynest that myghte be, In a trone whiche fer clerer dyde shyne Than Phebus in his spere celestyne; Whoos beaute, honoure, goodly porte, I haue to lytyll connynge to reporte. But, of eche thynge there as I toke hede, Amonge all other was wrytten in her trone, In golde letters, this worde, whiche I dyde rede, Garder le fortune, que est mauelz et bone! And, as I stode redynge this verse myselfe allone, Her chyef gentylwoman, Daunger by her name, Gaue me a taunte, and sayde I was to blame To be so perte to prese so proudly vppe: She sayde she trowed that I had eten sause; She asked yf euer I dranke of saucys cuppe. And I than softly answered to that clause, That, so to saye, I had gyuen her no cause. Than asked she me, Syr, so God thé spede, What is thy name? and I sayde, it was Drede. What mouyd thé, quod she, hydder to come? Forsoth, quod I, to bye some of youre ware. And with that worde on me she gaue a glome With browes bente, and gan on me to stare Full daynnously, and fro me she dyde fare, Leuynge me stondynge as a mased man: To whome there came an other gentylwoman; Desyre her name was, and so she me tolde, Sayenge to me, Broder, be of good chere, Abasshe you not, but hardely be bolde, Auaunce yourselfe to aproche and come nere: What though our chaffer be neuer so dere, Yet I auyse you to speke, for ony drede: Who spareth to speke, in fayth he spareth to spede. Maystres, quod I, I haue none aquentaunce, That wyll for me be medyatoure and mene; And this an other, I haue but smale substaunce. Pece, quod Desyre, ye speke not worth a bene: Yf ye haue not, in fayth I wyll you lene A precyous jewell, no rycher in this londe; Bone Auenture haue here now in your honde. Shyfte now therwith, let see, as ye can, In Bowge of Courte cheuysaunce to make; For I dare saye that there nys erthly man But, an he can Bone Auenture take, There can no fauour nor frendshyp hym forsake; Bone Auenture may brynge you in suche case That ye shall stonde in fauoure and in grace. But of one thynge I werne you er I goo, She that styreth the shyp, make her your frende. Maystres, quod I, I praye you tell me why soo, And how I maye that waye and meanes fynde. Forsothe, quod she, how euer blowe the wynde Fortune gydeth and ruleth all oure shyppe: Whome she hateth shall ouer the see boorde skyp; Whome she loueth, of all plesyre is ryche, Whyles she laugheth and hath luste for to playe; Whome she hateth, she casteth in the dyche, For whan she frouneth, she thynketh to make a fray; She cheryssheth him, and hym she casseth awaye. Alas, quod I, how myghte I haue her sure? In fayth, quod she, by Bone Auenture. Thus, in a rowe, of martchauntes a grete route Suwed to Fortune that she wold be theyre frynde: They thronge in fast, and flocked her aboute; And I with them prayed her to haue in mynde. She promysed to vs all she wolde be kynde: Of Bowge of Court she asketh what we wold haue; And we asked Fauoure, and Fauour she vs gaue. Thus endeth the Prologue; and begynneth the Bowge of Courte breuely compyled. DREDE. The sayle is vp, Fortune ruleth our helme, We wante no wynd to passe now ouer all; Fauoure we haue tougher than ony elme, That wyll abyde and neuer from vs fall: But vnder hony ofte tyme lyeth bytter gall; For, as me thoughte, in our shyppe I dyde see Full subtyll persones, in nombre foure and thre. The fyrste was Fauell, full of flatery, Wyth fables false that well coude fayne a tale; The seconde was Suspecte, whiche that dayly Mysdempte eche man, with face deedly and pale; And Haruy Hafter, that well coude picke a male; With other foure of theyr affynyte, Dysdayne, Ryotte, Dyssymuler, Subtylte. Fortune theyr frende, with whome oft she dyde daunce; They coude not faile, thei thought, they were so sure; And oftentymes I wolde myselfe auaunce With them to make solace and pleasure; But my dysporte they coude not well endure; They sayde they hated for to dele with Drede. Than Fauell gan wyth fayre speche me to fede. FAUELL. Noo thynge erthely that I wonder so sore As of your connynge, that it is so excellent; Deynte to haue with vs suche one in store, So vertuously that hath his dayes spente: Fortune to you gyftes of grace hath lente: Loo, what it is a man to haue connynge! All erthly tresoure it is surmountynge. Ye be an apte man, as ony can be founde, To dwell with vs, and serue my ladyes grace; Ye be to her yea worth a thousande pounde; I herde her speke of you within shorte space, Whan there were dyuerse that sore dyde you manace; And, though I say it, I was myselfe your frende, For here be dyuerse to you that be vnkynde. But this one thynge ye maye be sure of me; For, by that Lorde that bought dere all mankynde, I can not flater, I muste be playne to thé; And ye nede ought, man, shewe to me your mynde, For ye haue me whome faythfull ye shall fynde; Whyles I haue ought, by God, thou shalt not lacke, And yf nede be, a bolde worde I dare cracke. Nay, naye, be sure, whyles I am on your syde, Ye maye not fall, truste me, ye maye not fayle; Ye stonde in fauoure, and Fortune is your gyde, And, as she wyll, so shall our grete shyppe sayle: Thyse lewde cok wattes shall neuermore preuayle Ageynste you hardely, therfore be not afrayde: Farewell tyll soone; but no worde that I sayde. DREDE. Than thanked I hym for his grete gentylnes: But, as me thoughte, he ware on hym a cloke, That lyned was with doubtfull doublenes; Me thoughte, of wordes that he had full a poke; His stomak stuffed ofte tymes dyde reboke: Suspycyon, me thoughte, mette hym at a brayde, And I drewe nere to herke what they two sayde. In faythe, quod Suspecte, spake Drede no worde of me? Why, what than? wylte thou lete men to speke? He sayth, he can not well accorde with thé. Twyst, quod Suspecte, goo playe, hym I nereke. By Cryste, quod Fauell, Drede is soleyne freke: What lete vs holde him vp, man, for a whyle? Ye soo, quod Suspecte, he maye vs bothe begyle. And whan he came walkynge soberly, Wyth whom and ha, and with a croked loke, Me thoughte, his hede was full of gelousy, His eyne rollynge, his hondes faste they quoke; And to me warde the strayte waye he toke: God spede, broder! to me quod he than; And thus to talke with me he began. SUSPYCYON. Ye remembre the gentylman ryghte nowe That commaunde with you, me thought, a party space? Beware of him, for, I make God auowe, He wyll begyle you and speke fayre to your face; Ye neuer dwelte in suche an other place, For here is none that dare well other truste; But I wolde telle you a thynge, and I durste. Spake he a fayth no worde to you of me? I wote, and he dyde, ye wolde me telle. I haue a fauoure to you, wherof it be That I muste shewe you moche of my counselle: But I wonder what the deuyll of helle He sayde of me, whan he with you dyde talke: By myne auyse vse not with him to walke. The soueraynst thynge that ony man maye haue, Is lytyll to saye, and moche to here and see; For, but I trusted you, so God me saue, I wolde noo thynge so playne be; To you oonly, me thynke, I durste shryue me; For now am I plenarely dysposed To shewe you thynges that may not be disclosed. DREDE. Than I assured hym my fydelyte, His counseyle secrete neuer to dyscure, Yf he coude fynde in herte to truste me; Els I prayed hym, with all my besy cure, To kepe it hymselfe, for than he myghte be sure That noo man erthly coude hym bewreye, Whyles of hys mynde it were lockte with the keye. By God, quod he, this and thus it is; And of his mynde he shewed me all and some. Farewell, quod he, we wyll talke more of this: Soo he departed there he wolde be come. I dare not speke, I promysed to be dome: But, as I stode musynge in my mynde, Haruy Hafter came lepynge, lyghte as lynde. Vpon his breste he bare a versynge boxe; His throte was clere, and lustely coude fayne; Me thoughte, his gowne was all furred wyth foxe; And euer he sange, Sythe I am no thynge playne. To kepe him frome pykyng it was a grete payne: He gased on me with his gotyshe berde; Whan I loked on hym, my purse was half aferde. HARUY HAFTER. Syr, God you saue! why loke ye so sadde? What thynge is that I maye do for you? A wonder thynge that ye waxe not madde! For, and I studye sholde as ye doo nowe, My wytte wolde waste, I make God auowe. Tell me your mynde: me thynke, ye make a verse; I coude it skan, and ye wolde it reherse. But to the poynte shortely to procede, Where hathe your dwellynge ben, er ye cam here? For, as I trowe, I haue sene you indede Er this, whan that ye made me royall chere. Holde vp the helme, loke vp, and lete God stere: I wolde be mery, what wynde that euer blowe, Heue and how rombelow, row the bote, Norman, rowe! Prynces of yougthe can ye synge by rote? Or shall I sayle wyth you a felashyp assaye; For on the booke I can not synge a note. Wolde to God, it wolde please you some daye A balade boke before me for to laye, And lerne me to synge, Re, my, fa, sol! And, whan I fayle, bobbe me on the noll. Loo, what is to you a pleasure grete, To haue that connynge and wayes that ye haue! By Goddis soule, I wonder how ye gete Soo greate pleasyre, or who to you it gaue: Syr, pardone me, I am an homely knaue, To be with you thus perte and thus bolde; But ye be welcome to our housholde. And, I dare saye, there is no man here inne But wolde be glad of your company: I wyste neuer man that so soone coude wynne The fauoure that ye haue with my lady; I praye to God that it maye neuer dy: It is your fortune for to haue that grace; As I be saued, it is a wonder case. For, as for me, I serued here many a daye, And yet vnneth I can haue my lyuynge: But I requyre you no worde that I saye; For, and I knowe ony erthly thynge That is agayne you, ye shall haue wetynge: And ye be welcome, syr, so God me saue: I hope here after a frende of you to haue. DREDE. Wyth that, as he departed soo fro me, Anone ther mette with him, as me thoughte, A man, but wonderly besene was he; He loked hawte, he sette eche man at noughte; His gawdy garment with scornnys was all wrought; With indygnacyon lyned was his hode; He frowned, as he wolde swere by Cockes blode; He bote the lyppe, he loked passynge coye; His face was belymmed, as byes had him stounge: It was no tyme with him to jape nor toye; Enuye hathe wasted his lyuer and his lounge, Hatred by the herte so had hym wrounge, That he loked pale as asshes to my syghte: Dysdayne, I wene, this comerous crabes hyghte. To Heruy Hafter than he spake of me, And I drewe nere to harke what they two sayde. Now, quod Dysdayne, as I shall saued be, I haue grete scorne, and am ryghte euyll apayed. Than quod Heruy, why arte thou so dysmayde? By Cryste, quod he, for it is shame to saye; To see Johan Dawes, that came but yester daye, How he is now taken in conceyte, This doctour Dawcocke, Drede, I wene, he hyghte: By Goddis bones, but yf we haue som sleyte, It is lyke he wyll stonde in our lyghte. By God, quod Heruy, and it so happen myghte; Lete vs therfore shortely at a worde Fynde some mene to caste him ouer the borde. By Him that me boughte, than quod Dysdayne, I wonder sore he is in suche conceyte. Turde, quod Hafter, I wyll thé no thynge layne, There muste for hym be layde some prety beyte; We tweyne, I trowe, be not withoute dysceyte: Fyrste pycke a quarell, and fall oute with hym then, And soo outface hym with a carde of ten. Forthwith he made on me a prowde assawte, With scornfull loke meuyd all in moode; He wente aboute to take me in a fawte; He frounde, he stared, he stampped where he stoode. I lokyd on hym, I wende he had be woode. He sent the arme proudly vnder the syde, And in this wyse he gan with me to chyde. DISDAYNE. Remembrest thou what thou sayd yester nyght? Wylt thou abyde by the wordes agayne? By God, I haue of thé now grete dyspyte; I shall thé angre ones in euery vayne: It is greate scorne to see suche an hayne As thou arte, one that cam but yesterdaye, With vs olde seruauntes suche maysters to playe. I tell thé, I am of countenaunce: What weneste I were? I trowe, thou knowe not me. By Goddis woundes, but for dysplesaunce, Of my querell soone wolde I venged be: But no force, I shall ones mete with thé; Come whan it wyll, oppose thé I shall, What someuer auenture therof fall. Trowest thou, dreuyll, I saye, thou gawdy knaue, That I haue deynte to see thé cherysshed thus? By Goddis syd, my sworde thy berde shall shaue; Well, ones thou shalte be chermed, I wus: Naye, strawe for tales, thou shalte not rule vs; We be thy betters, and so thou shalte vs take, Or we shall thé oute of thy clothes shake. DREDE. Wyth that came Ryotte, russhynge all at ones, A rusty gallande, to-ragged and to-rente; And on the borde he whyrled a payre of bones, Quater treye dews he clatered as he wente; Now haue at all, by saynte Thomas of Kente! And euer he threwe and kyst I wote nere what: His here was growen thorowe oute his hat. Thenne I behelde how he dysgysed was: His hede was heuy for watchynge ouer nyghte, His eyen blereed, his face shone lyke a glas; His gowne so shorte that it ne couer myghte His rumpe, he wente so all for somer lyghte; His hose was garded wyth a lyste of grene, Yet at the knee they were broken, I wene. His cote was checked with patches rede and blewe; Of Kyrkeby Kendall was his shorte demye; And ay he sange, In fayth, decon thou crewe; His elbowe bare, he ware his gere so nye; His nose a droppynge, his lyppes were full drye; And by his syde his whynarde and his pouche, The deuyll myghte daunce therin for ony crowche. Counter he coude O lux vpon a potte; An eestryche fedder of a capons tayle He set vp fresshely vpon his hat alofte: What, reuell route! quod he, and gan to rayle How oft he hadde hit Jenet on the tayle, Of Felyce fetewse, and lytell prety Cate, How ofte he knocked at her klycked gate. What sholde I tell more of his rebaudrye? I was ashamed so to here hym prate: He had no pleasure but in harlotrye. Ay, quod he, in the deuylles date, What art thou? I sawe thé nowe but late. Forsothe, quod I, in this courte I dwell nowe. Welcome, quod Ryote, I make God auowe. RYOTE. And, syr, in fayth why comste not vs amonge, To make thé mery, as other felowes done? Thou muste swere and stare, man, al daye longe, And wake all nyghte, and slepe tyll it be none; Thou mayste not studye, or muse on the mone; This worlde is nothynge but ete, drynke, and slepe, And thus with vs good company to kepe. Plucke vp thyne herte vpon a mery pyne, And lete vs laugh a placke or tweyne at nale: What the deuyll, man, myrthe was neuer one! What, loo, man, see here of dyce a bale! A brydelynge caste for that is in thy male! Now haue at all that lyeth vpon the burde! Fye on this dyce, they be not worth a turde! Haue at the hasarde, or at the dosen browne, Or els I pas a peny to a pounde! Now, wolde to God, thou wolde leye money downe! Lorde, how that I wolde caste it full rounde! Ay, in my pouche a buckell I haue founde! The armes of Calyce, I haue no coyne nor crosse! I am not happy, I renne ay on the losse. Now renne muste I to the stewys syde, To wete yf Malkyn, my lemman, haue gete oughte: I lete her to hyre, that men maye on her ryde, Her armes easy ferre and nere is soughte: By Goddis sydes, syns I her thyder broughte, She hath gote me more money with her tayle Than hath some shyppe that into Bordews sayle. Had I as good an hors as she is a mare, I durst auenture to iourney through Fraunce; Who rydeth on her, he nedeth not to care, For she is trussed for to breke a launce; It is a curtel that well can wynche and praunce: To her wyll I nowe all my pouerte lege; And, tyll I come, haue here is myne hat to plege. DREDE. Gone is this knaue, this rybaude foule and leude; He ran as fast as euer that he myghte: Vnthryftynes in hym may well be shewed, For whome Tyborne groneth both daye and nyghte. And, as I stode and kyste asyde my syghte, Dysdayne I sawe with Dyssymulacyon Standynge in sadde communicacion. But there was poyntynge and noddynge with the hede, And many wordes sayde in secrete wyse; They wandred ay, and stode styll in no stede: Me thoughte, alwaye Dyscymular dyde deuyse; Me passynge sore myne herte than gan agryse, I dempte and drede theyr talkynge was not good. Anone Dyscymular came where I stode. Than in his hode I sawe there faces tweyne; That one was lene and lyke a pyned goost, That other loked as he wolde me haue slayne; And to me warde as he gan for to coost, Whan that he was euen at me almoost, I sawe a knyfe hyd in his one sleue, Wheron was wryten this worde, Myscheue. And in his other sleue, me thought, I sawe A spone of golde, full of hony swete, To fede a fole, and for to preue a dawe; And on that sleue these wordes were wrete, A false abstracte cometh from a fals concrete: His hode was syde, his cope was roset graye: Thyse were the wordes that he to me dyde saye. DYSSYMULATION. How do ye, mayster? ye loke so soberly: As I be saued at the dredefull daye, It is a perylous vyce, this enuy: Alas, a connynge man ne dwelle maye In no place well, but foles with hym fraye! But as for that, connynge hath no foo Saue hym that nought can, Scrypture sayth soo. I knowe your vertu and your lytterature By that lytel connynge that I haue: Ye be malygned sore, I you ensure; But ye haue crafte your selfe alwaye to saue: It is grete scorne to se a mysproude knaue With a clerke that connynge is to prate: Lete theym go lowse theym, in the deuylles date! For all be it that this longe not to me, Yet on my backe I bere suche lewde delynge: Ryghte now I spake with one, I trowe, I see; But, what, a strawe! I maye not tell all thynge. By God, I saye there is grete herte brennynge Betwene the persone ye wote of, you; Alas, I coude not dele so with a Jew! I wolde eche man were as playne as I; It is a worlde, I saye, to here of some; I hate this faynynge, fye vpon it, fye! A man can not wote where to be come: I wys I coude tell,—but humlery, home; I dare not speke, we be so layde awayte, For all our courte is full of dysceyte. Now, by saynte Fraunceys, that holy man and frere, I hate these wayes agayne you that they take: Were I as you, I wolde ryde them full nere; And, by my trouthe, but yf an ende they make, Yet wyll I saye some wordes for your sake, That shall them angre, I holde thereon a grote; For some shall wene be hanged by the throte. I haue a stoppynge oyster in my poke, Truste me, and yf it come to a nede: But I am lothe for to reyse a smoke, Yf ye coude be otherwyse agrede; And so I wolde it were, so God me spede, For this maye brede to a confusyon, Withoute God make a good conclusyon. Naye, see where yonder stondeth the teder man! A flaterynge knaue and false he is, God wote; The dreuyll stondeth to herken, and he can: It were more thryft, he boughte him a newe cote; It will not be, his purse is not on flote: All that he wereth, it is borowed ware; His wytte is thynne, his hode is threde bare. More coude I saye, but what this is ynowe: Adewe tyll soone, we shall speke more of this: Ye muste be ruled as I shall tell you howe; Amendis maye be of that is now amys; And I am your, syr, so haue I blys, In euery poynte that I can do or saye; Gyue me your honde, farewell, and haue good daye. DREDE. Sodaynly, as he departed me fro, Came pressynge in one in a wonder araye: Er I was ware, behynde me he sayde, Bo! Thenne I, astonyed of that sodeyne fraye, Sterte all at ones, I lyked no thynge his playe; For, yf I had not quyckely fledde the touche, He had plucte oute the nobles of my pouche. He was trussed in a garmente strayte: I haue not sene suche an others page; For he coude well vpon a casket wayte; His hode all pounsed and garded lyke a cage; Lyghte lyme fynger, he toke none other wage. Harken, quod he, loo here myne honde in thyne; To vs welcome thou arte, by saynte Quyntyne. DISCEYTE. But, by that Lorde that is one, two, and thre, I haue an errande to rounde in your ere: He tolde me so, by God, ye maye truste me, Parte remembre whan ye were there, There I wynked on you,—wote ye not where? In A loco, I mene juxta B: Woo is hym that is blynde and maye not see! But to here the subtylte and the crafte, As I shall tell you, yf ye wyll harke agayne; And, whan I sawe the horsons wolde you hafte, To holde myne honde, by God, I had grete payne; For forthwyth there I had him slayne, But that I drede mordre wolde come oute: Who deleth with shrewes hath nede to loke aboute. DREDE. And as he rounded thus in myne ere Of false collusyon confetryd by assente, Me thoughte, I see lewde felawes here and there Came for to slee me of mortall entente; And, as they came, the shypborde faste I hente, And thoughte to lepe; and euen with that woke, Caughte penne and ynke, and wrote thys lytyll boke. I wolde therwith no man were myscontente; Besechynge you that shall it see or rede, In euery poynte to be indyfferente, Syth all in substaunce of slumbrynge doth procede: I wyll not saye it is mater in dede, But yet oftyme suche dremes be founde trewe: Now constrewe ye what is the resydewe. Thus endeth the Bowge of Courte. HERE AFTER FOLOWETH THE BOKE OF PHYLLYP SPAROWE. COMPYLED BY MAYSTER SKELTON, POETE LAUREATE. Pla ce bo, Who is there, who? Di le xi, Dame Margery; Fa, re, my, my, Wherfore and why, why? For the sowle of Philip Sparowe, That was late slayn at Carowe, Among the Nones Blake, For that swete soules sake, And for all sparowes soules, Set in our bederolles, Pater noster qui, With an Ave Mari, And with the corner of a Crede, The more shalbe your mede. Whan I remember agayn How mi Philyp was slayn, Neuer halfe the payne Was betwene you twayne, Pyramus and Thesbe, As than befell to me: I wept and I wayled, The tearys downe hayled; But nothynge it auayled To call Phylyp agayne, Whom Gyb our cat hath slayne. Gib, I saye, our cat Worrowyd her on that Which I loued best: It can not be exprest My sorrowfull heuynesse, But all without redresse; For within that stounde, Halfe slumbrynge, in a sounde I fell downe to the grounde. Vnneth I kest myne eyes Towarde the cloudy skyes: But whan I dyd beholde My sparow dead and colde, No creatuer but that wolde Haue rewed vpon me, To behold and se What heuynesse dyd me pange; Wherewith my handes I wrange, That my senaws cracked, As though I had been racked, So payned and so strayned, That no lyfe wellnye remayned. I syghed and I sobbed, For that I was robbed Of my sparowes lyfe. O mayden, wydow, and wyfe, Of what estate ye be, Of hye or lowe degre, Great sorowe than ye myght se And lerne to wepe at me! Such paynes dyd me frete, That myne hert dyd bete, My vysage pale and dead, Wanne, and blewe as lead; The panges of hatefull death Wellnye had stopped my breath. Heu, heu, me, That I am wo for thé! Ad Dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi: Of God nothynge els craue I But Phyllypes soule to kepe From the marees deepe Of Acherontes well, That is a flode of hell; And from the great Pluto, The prynce of endles wo; And from foule Alecto, With vysage blacke and blo; And from Medusa, that mare, That lyke a fende doth stare: And from Megeras edders, For rufflynge of Phillips fethers, And from her fyry sparklynges, For burnynge of his wynges; And from the smokes sowre Of Proserpinas bowre; And from the dennes darke, Wher Cerberus doth barke, Whom Theseus dyd afraye, Whom Hercules dyd outraye, As famous poetes say; From that hell hounde, That lyeth in cheynes bounde, With gastly hedes thre, To Jupyter pray we That Phyllyp preserued may be! Amen, say ye with me! Do mi nus, Helpe nowe, swete Jesus! Levavi oculos meos in montes: Wolde God I had Zenophontes, Or Socrates the wyse, To shew me their deuyse, Moderatly to take This sorow that I make For Phyllip Sparowes sake! So feruently I shake, I fele my body quake; So vrgently I am brought Into carefull thought. Like Andromach, Hectors wyfe, Was wery of her lyfe, Whan she had lost her ioye, Noble Hector of Troye; In lyke maner also Encreaseth my dedly wo, For my sparowe is go. It was so prety a fole, It wold syt on a stole, And lerned after my scole For to kepe his cut, With, Phyllyp, kepe your cut! It had a veluet cap, And wold syt vpon my lap, And seke after small wormes, And somtyme white bred crommes; And many tymes and ofte Betwene my brestes softe It wolde lye and rest; It was propre and prest. Somtyme he wolde gaspe Whan he sawe a waspe; A fly or a gnat, He wolde flye at that; And prytely he wold pant Whan he saw an ant; Lord, how he wolde pry After the butterfly! Lorde, how he wolde hop After the gressop! And whan I sayd, Phyp, Phyp, Than he wold lepe and skyp, And take me by the lyp. Alas, it wyll me slo, That Phillyp is gone me fro! Sin in i qui ta tes Alas, I was euyll at ease! De pro fun dis cla ma vi, Whan I sawe my sparowe dye! Nowe, after my dome, Dame Sulpicia at Rome, Whose name regystered was For euer in tables of bras, Because that she dyd pas In poesy to endyte, And eloquently to wryte, Though she wolde pretende My sparowe to commende, I trowe she coude not amende Reportynge the vertues all Of my sparowe royall. For it wold come and go, And fly so to and fro; And on me it wolde lepe Whan I was aslepe, And his fethers shake, Wherewith he wolde make Me often for to wake, And for to take him in Vpon my naked skyn; God wot, we thought no syn: What though he crept so lowe? It was not hurt, I trowe, He dyd nothynge perde But syt vpon my kne: Phyllyp, though he were nyse, In him it was no vyse; Phyllyp had leue to go To pyke my lytell too; Phillip myght be bolde And do what he wolde; Phillip wolde seke and take All the flees blake That he coulde there espye With his wanton eye. O pe ra, La, soll, fa, fa, Confitebor tibi, Domine, in toto corde meo. Alas, I wold ryde and go A thousand myle of grounde! If any such might be found, It were worth an hundreth pound Of kynge Cresus golde, Or of Attalus the olde, The ryche prynce of Pargame, Who so lyst the story to se. Cadmus, that his syster sought, And he shold be bought For golde and fee, He shuld ouer the see, To wete if he coulde brynge Auy of the ofsprynge, Or any of the blode. But whoso vnderstode Of Medeas arte, I wolde I had a parte Of her crafty magyke! My sparowe than shuld be quycke With a charme or twayne, And playe with me agayne. But all this is in vayne Thus for to complayne. I toke my sampler ones, Of purpose, for the nones, To sowe with stytchis of sylke My sparow whyte as mylke, That by representacyon Of his image and facyon, To me it myght importe Some pleasure and comforte For my solas and sporte: But whan I was sowing his beke, Methought my sparow did speke, And opened his prety byll, Saynge, Mayde, ye are in wyll Agayne me for to kyll, Ye prycke me in the head! With that my nedle waxed red, Methought, of Phyllyps blode; Myne hear ryght vpstode, And was in suche a fray, My speche was taken away. I kest downe that there was, And sayd, Alas, alas, How commeth this to pas? My fyngers, dead and colde, Coude not my sampler holde; My nedle and threde I threwe away for drede. The best now that I maye, Is for his soule to pray: A porta inferi, Good Lorde, haue mercy Vpon my sparowes soule, Wryten in my bederoule! Au di vi vo cem, Japhet, Cam, and Sem, Ma gni fi cat, Shewe me the ryght path To the hylles of Armony, Wherfore the birdes yet cry Of your fathers bote, That was sometyme aflote, And nowe they lye and rote; Let some poetes wryte Deucalyons flode it hyght: But as verely as ye be The naturall sonnes thre Of Noe the patryarke, That made that great arke, Wherin he had apes and owles, Beestes, byrdes, and foules, That if ye can fynde Any of my sparowes kynde, God send the soule good rest! I wolde haue yet a nest As prety and as prest As my sparowe was. But my sparowe dyd pas All the sparows of the wode That were syns Noes flode, Was neuer none so good; Kynge Phylyp of Macedony Had no such Phylyp as I, No, no, syr, hardely. That vengeaunce I aske and crye, By way of exclamacyon, On all the hole nacyon Of cattes wylde and tame; God send them sorowe and shame! That cat specyally That slew so cruelly My lytell prety sparowe That I brought vp at Carowe. O cat of carlyshe kynde, The fynde was in thy mynde Whan thou my byrde vntwynde! I wold thou haddest ben blynde! The leopardes sauage, The lyons in theyr rage, Myght catche thé in theyr pawes, And gnawe thé in theyr iawes! The serpentes of Lybany Myght stynge thé venymously! The dragones with their tonges Might poyson thy lyuer aud longes! The mantycors of the mountaynes Myght fede them on thy braynes! Melanchates, that hounde That plucked Acteon to the grounde, Gaue hym his mortall wounde, Chaunged to a dere, The story doth appere, Was chaunged to an harte: So thou, foule cat that thou arte, The selfe same hounde Myght thé confounde, That his owne lord bote, Myght byte asondre thy throte! Of Inde the gredy grypes Myght tere out all thy trypes! Of Arcady the beares Might plucke awaye thyne eares! The wylde wolfe Lycaon Byte asondre thy backe bone! Of Ethna the brennynge hyll, That day and night brenneth styl Set in thy tayle a blase, That all the world may gase And wonder vpon thé, From Occyan the greate se Vnto the Iles of Orchady, From Tyllbery fery To the playne of Salysbery! So trayterously my byrde to kyll That neuer ought thé euyll wyll! Was neuer byrde in cage More gentle of corage In doynge his homage Vnto his souerayne. Alas, I say agayne, Deth hath departed vs twayne! The false cat hath thé slayne: Farewell, Phyllyp, adew! Our Lorde thy soule reskew! Farewell without restore, Farewell for euermore! And it were a Jewe, It wolde make one rew, To se my sorow new. These vylanous false cattes Were made for myse and rattes, And not for byrdes smale. Alas, my face waxeth pale, Tellynge this pyteyus tale, How my byrde so fayre, That was wont to repayre, And go in at my spayre, And crepe in at my gore Of my gowne before, Flyckerynge with his wynges! Alas, my hert it stynges, Remembrynge prety thynges! Alas, myne hert it sleth My Phyllyppes dolefull deth, Whan I remembre it, How pretely it wolde syt, Many tymes and ofte Vpon my fynger aloft! I played with him tyttell tattyll, And fed him with my spattyl, With his byll betwene my lippes; It was my prety Phyppes! Many a prety kusse Had I of his swete musse; And now the cause is thus, That he is slayne me fro, To my great payne and wo. Of fortune this the chaunce Standeth on varyaunce: Oft tyme after pleasaunce Trouble and greuaunce; No man can be sure Allway to haue pleasure: As well perceyue ye maye How my dysport and play From me was taken away By Gyb, our cat sauage, That in a furyous rage Caught Phyllyp by the head, And slew him there starke dead. Kyrie, eleison, Christe, eleison, Kyrie, eleison! For Phylyp Sparowes soule, Set in our bederolle, Let vs now whysper A Pater noster. Lauda, anima mea, Dominum! To wepe with me loke that ye come, All manner of byrdes in your kynd; Se none be left behynde. To mornynge loke that ye fall With dolorous songes funerall, Some to synge, and some to say, Some to wepe, and some to pray, Euery byrde in his laye. The goldfynche, the wagtayle; The ianglynge iay to rayle, The fleckyd pye to chatter Of this dolorous mater; And robyn redbrest, He shall be the preest The requiem masse to synge, Softly warbelynge, With helpe of the red sparow, And the chattrynge swallow, This herse for to halow; The larke with his longe to; The spynke, and the martynet also; The shouelar with his brode bek; The doterell, that folyshe pek, And also the mad coote, With a balde face to toote; The feldefare, and the snyte; The crowe, and the kyte; The rauyn, called Rolfe, His playne songe to solfe; The partryche, the quayle; The plouer with vs to wayle; The woodhacke, that syngeth chur Horsly, as he had the mur; The lusty chauntyng nyghtyngale; The popyngay to tell her tale, That toteth oft in a glasse, Shal rede the Gospell at masse; The mauys with her whystell Shal rede there the pystell. But with a large and a longe To kepe iust playne songe, Our chaunters shalbe the cuckoue, The culuer, the stockedowue, With puwyt the lapwyng, The versycles shall syng. The bitter with his bumpe, The crane with his trumpe, The swan of Menander, The gose and the gander, The ducke and the drake, Shall watche at this wake; The pecocke so prowde, Bycause his voyce is lowde, And hath a glorious tayle, He shall syng the grayle; The owle, that is so foule, Must helpe vs to houle; The heron so gaunce, And the cormoraunce, With the fesaunte, And the gaglynge gaunte, And the churlysshe chowgh; The route and the kowgh; The barnacle, the bussarde, With the wilde mallarde; The dyuendop to slepe; The water hen to wepe; The puffin and the tele Money they shall dele To poore folke at large, That shall be theyr charge; The semewe and the tytmose; The wodcocke with the longe nose; The threstyl with her warblyng; The starlyng with her brablyng; The roke, with the ospraye That putteth fysshes to a fraye; And the denty curlewe, With the turtyll most trew. At this Placebo We may not well forgo The countrynge of the coe: The storke also, That maketh his nest In chymneyes to rest; Within those walles No broken galles May there abyde Of cokoldry syde, Of els phylosophy Maketh a great lye. The estryge, that wyll eate An horshowe so great, In the stede of meate, Such feruent heat His stomake doth freat; He can not well fly, Nor synge tunably, Yet at a brayde He hath well assayde To solfe aboue ela, Ga, lorell, fa, fa; Ne quando Male cantando, The best that we can, To make hym our belman, And let hym ryng the bellys; He can do nothyng ellys. Chaunteclere, our coke, Must tell what is of the clocke By the ostrology That he hath naturally Conceyued and cought, And was neuer tought By Albumazer The astronomer, Nor by Ptholomy Prince of astronomy, Nor yet by Haly; And yet he croweth dayly And nightly the tydes That no man abydes, With Partlot his hen, Whom now and then Hee plucketh by the hede Whan he doth her trede. The byrde of Araby, That potencyally May neuer dye, And yet there is none But one alone; A phenex it is This herse that must blys With armatycke gummes That cost great summes, The way of thurifycation To make a fumigation, Swete of reflary, And redolent of eyre, This corse for to sence With greate reuerence, As patryarke or pope In a blacke cope; Whyles he senseth [the herse], He shall synge the verse, Libera me, In de, la, soll, re, Softly bemole For my sparowes soule. Plinni sheweth all In his story naturall What he doth fynde Of the phenyx kynde; Of whose incyneracyon There ryseth a new creacyon Of the same facyon Without alteracyon, Sauyng that olde age Is turned into corage Of fresshe youth agayne; This matter trew and playne, Playne matter indede, Who so lyst to rede. But for the egle doth flye Hyest in the skye, He shall be the sedeane, The quere to demeane, As prouost pryncypall, To teach them theyr ordynall; Also the noble fawcon, With the gerfawcon, The tarsell gentyll, They shall morne soft and styll In theyr amysse of gray; The sacre with them shall say Dirige for Phyllyppes soule; The goshauke shall haue a role The queresters to controll; The lanners and the marlyons Shall stand in their morning gounes; The hobby and the muskette The sensers and the crosse shall fet; The kestrell in all this warke Shall be holy water clarke. And now the darke cloudy nyght Chaseth away Phebus bryght, Taking his course toward the west, God sende my sparoes sole good rest! Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine! Fa, fa, fa, my, re, re, A por ta in fe ri, Fa, fa, fa, my, my. Credo videre bona Domini, I pray God, Phillip to heuen may fly! Domine, exaudi orationem meam! To heuen he shall, from heuen he cam! Do mi nus vo bis cum! Of al good praiers God send him sum! Oremus. Deus, cui proprium est misereri et parcere, On Phillips soule haue pyte! For he was a prety cocke, And came of a gentyll stocke, And wrapt in a maidenes smocke, And cherysshed full dayntely, Tyll cruell fate made him to dy: Alas, for dolefull desteny! But whereto shuld I Lenger morne or crye? To Jupyter I call, Of heuen emperyall, That Phyllyp may fly Aboue the starry sky, To treade the prety wren, That is our Ladyes hen: Amen, amen, amen! Yet one thynge is behynde, That now commeth to mynde; An epytaphe I wold haue For Phyllyppes graue: But for I am a mayde, Tymerous, halfe afrayde, That neuer yet asayde Of Elyconys well, Where the Muses dwell; Though I can rede and spell. Recounte, reporte, and tell Of the Tales of Caunterbury, Some sad storyes, some mery As Palamon and Arcet, Duke Theseus, and Partelet; And of the Wyfe of Bath, That worketh moch scath Whan her tale is tolde Amonge huswyues bolde, How she controlde Her husbandes as she wolde, And them to despyse In the homylyest wyse, Brynge other wyues in thought Their husbandes to set at nought And though that rede haue I Of Gawen and syr Guy, And tell can a great pece Of the Golden Flece, How Jason it wan, Lyke a valyaunt man; Of Arturs rounde table, With his knightes commendable, And dame Gaynour, his quene, Was somewhat wanton, I wene; How syr Launcelote de Lake Many a spere brake For his ladyes sake; Of Trystram, and kynge Marke, And al the hole warke Of Bele Isold his wyfe, For whom was moch stryfe; Some say she was lyght, And made her husband knyght Of the comyne hall, That cuckoldes men call; And of syr Lybius, Named Dysconius; Of Quater Fylz Amund, And how they were sommonde To Rome, to Charlemayne, Vpon a great payne, And how they rode eche one On Bayarde Mountalbon; Men se hym now and then In the forest of Arden: What though I can frame The storyes by name Of Judas Machabeus, And of Cesar Julious; And of the loue betwene Paris and Vyene; And of the duke Hannyball, That made the Romaynes all Fordrede and to quake; How Scipion dyd wake The cytye of Cartage, Which by his vnmerciful rage He bete down to the grounde: And though I can expounde Of Hector of Troye, That was all theyr ioye, Whom Achylles slew, Wherfore all Troy dyd rew; And of the loue so hote That made Troylus to dote Vpon fayre Cressyde, And what they wrote and sayd, And of theyr wanton wylles Pandaer bare the bylles From one to the other; His maisters loue to further, Somtyme a presyous thyng, An ouche, or els a ryng; From her to hym agayn Somtyme a prety chayn, Or a bracelet of her here, Prayd Troylus for to were That token for her sake; How hartely he dyd it take, And moche therof dyd make; And all that was in vayne, For she dyd but fayne; The story telleth playne, He coulde not optayne, Though his father were a kyng, Yet there was a thyng That made the male to wryng; She made him to syng The song of louers lay; Musyng nyght and day, Mournynge all alone, Comfort had he none, For she was quyte gone; Thus in conclusyon, She brought him in abusyon; In ernest and in game She was moch to blame; Disparaged is her fame, And blemysshed is her name, In maner half with shame; Troylus also hath lost On her moch loue and cost, And now must kys the post; Pandara, that went betwene, Hath won nothing, I wene, But lyght for somer grene; Yet for a speciall laud He is named Troylus baud, Of that name he is sure Whyles the world shall dure: Though I remembre the fable Of Penelope most stable To her husband most trew, Yet long tyme she ne knew Whether he were on lyue or ded; Her wyt stood her in sted, That she was true and iust For any bodely lust To Ulixes her make, And neuer wold him forsake: Of Marcus Marcullus A proces I could tell vs; And of Anteocus; And of Josephus De Antiquitatibus; And of Mardocheus, And of great Assuerus, And of Vesca his queene, Whom he forsoke with teene, And of Hester his other wyfe, With whom he ledd a plesaunt life; Of kyng Alexander; And of kyng Euander; And of Porcena the great, That made the Romayns to sweat: Though I haue enrold A thousand new and old Of these historious tales, To fyll bougets and males With bokes that I haue red, Yet I am nothyng sped, And can but lytell skyll Of Ouyd or Virgyll, Or of Plutharke, Or Frauncys Petrarke, Alcheus or Sapho, Or such other poetes mo, As Linus and Homerus, Euphorion and Theocritus, Anacreon and Arion, Sophocles and Philemon, Pyndarus and Symonides, Philistion and Phorocides; These poetes of auncyente, They ar to diffuse for me: For, as I tofore haue sayd, I am but a yong mayd, And cannot in effect My style as yet direct With Englysh wordes elect: Our naturall tong is rude, And hard to be enneude With pullysshed termes lusty; Our language is so rusty, So cankered, and so full Of frowardes, and so dull, That if I wolde apply To wryte ornatly, I wot not where to fynd Termes to serue my mynde. Gowers Englysh is olde, And of no value told; His mater is worth gold, And worthy to be enrold. In Chauser I am sped, His tales I haue red: His mater is delectable, Solacious, and commendable; His Englysh well alowed, So as it is enprowed, For as it is enployed, There is no Englysh voyd, At those dayes moch commended, And now men wold haue amended His Englysh, whereat they barke, And mar all they warke: Chaucer, that famus clerke, His termes were not darke, But plesaunt, easy, and playne; No worde he wrote in vayne. Also Johnn Lydgate Wryteth after an hyer rate; It is dyffuse to fynde The sentence of his mynde, Yet wryteth he in his kynd, No man that can amend Those maters that he hath pende; Yet some men fynde a faute, And say he wryteth to haute. Wherfore hold me excused If I haue not well perused Myne Englyssh halfe abused; Though it be refused, In worth I shall it take, And fewer wordes make. But, for my sparowes sake, Yet as a woman may, My wyt I shall assay An epytaphe to wryght In Latyne playne and lyght, Wherof the elegy Foloweth by and by: Flos volucrum formose, vale! Philippe, sub isto Marmore jam recubas, Qui mihi carus eras. Semper erunt nitido Radiantia sidera cælo; Impressusque meo Pectore semper eris. Per me laurigerum Britonum Skeltonida vatem Hæc cecinisse licet Ficta sub imagine texta. Cujus eras volucris, Præstanti corpore virgo; Candida Nais erat, Formosior ista Joanna est; Docta Corinna fuit, Sed magis ista sapit. Bien men souient. THE COMMENDACIONS. Beati in ma cu la ti in via, O gloriosa fœmina! Now myne hole imaginacion And studyous medytacion Is to take this commendacyon In this consyderacion; And vnder pacyent tolleracyon Of that most goodly mayd That Placebo hath sayd, And for her sparow prayd In lamentable wyse, Now wyll I enterpryse, Thorow the grace dyuyne Of the Muses nyne, Her beautye to commende, If Arethusa wyll send Me enfluence to endyte, And with my pen to wryte; If Apollo wyll promyse, Melodyously it to deuyse, His tunable harpe stryngges With armony that synges Of princes and of kynges And of all pleasaunt thynges, Of lust and of delyght, Thorow his godly myght; To whom be the laude ascrybed That my pen hath enbybed With the aureat droppes, As verely my hope is, Of Thagus, that golden flod, That passeth all erthly good; And as that flode doth pas Al floodes that euer was With his golden sandes, Who so that vnderstandes Cosmography, and the stremys And the floodes in straunge remes, Ryght so she doth excede All other of whom we rede, Whose fame by me shall sprede Into Perce and Mede, From Brytons Albion To the Towre of Babilon. I trust it is no shame, And no man wyll me blame, Though I regester her name In the courte of Fame; For this most goodly floure, This blossome of fresshe coulour, So Jupiter me socour, She floryssheth new and new In bewte and vertew; Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Retribue servo tuo, vivifica me! Labia mea laudabunt te. But enforsed am I Openly to askry, And to make an outcri Against odyous Enui, That euermore wil ly, And say cursedly; With his ledder ey, And chekes dry; With vysage wan, As swarte as tan; His bones crake, Leane as a rake; His gummes rusty Are full vnlusty; Hys herte withall Bytter as gall; His lyuer, his longe With anger is wronge; His serpentes tonge That many one hath stonge; He frowneth euer; He laugheth neuer, Euen nor morow, But other mennes sorow Causeth him to gryn And reioyce therin; No slepe can him catch, But euer doth watch, He is so bete With malyce, and frete With angre and yre, His foule desyre Wyll suffre no slepe In his hed to crepe; His foule semblaunt All displeasaunte; Whan other ar glad, Than is he sad; Frantyke and mad; His tong neuer styll For to say yll, Wrythyng and wringyng, Bytyng and styngyng; And thus this elf Consumeth himself, Hymself doth slo Wyth payne and wo. This fals Enuy Sayth that I Vse great folly For to endyte, And for to wryte, And spend my tyme In prose and ryme, For to expres The noblenes Of my maistres, That causeth me Studious to be To make a relation Of her commendation; And there agayne Enuy doth complayne, And hath disdayne; But yet certayne I wyll be playne, And my style dres To this prosses. Now Phebus me ken To sharpe my pen, And lede my fyst As hym best lyst, That I may say Honour alway Of womankynd! Trouth doth me bynd And loyalte Euer to be Their true bedell, To wryte and tell How women excell In noblenes; As my maistres, Of whom I thynk With pen and ynk For to compyle Some goodly style; For this most goodly floure, This blossome of fresh coloure, So Jupyter me socoure, She flourissheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Legem pone mihi, domina, in viam justificationum tuarum! Quemadmodum desiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum. How shall I report All the goodly sort Of her fetures clere, That hath non erthly pere? Her fauour of her face Ennewed all with grace, Confort, pleasure, and solace, Myne hert doth so enbrace, And so hath rauyshed me Her to behold and se, That in wordes playne I cannot me refrayne To loke on her agayne: Alas, what shuld I fayne? It wer a plesaunt payne With her aye to remayne. Her eyen gray and stepe Causeth myne hert to lepe; With her browes bent She may well represent Fayre Lucres, as I wene, Or els fayre Polexene, Or els Caliope, Or els Penolope; For this most goodly floure, This blossome of fresshe coloure, So Jupiter me socoure, She florisheth new end new In beautye and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo! Servus tuus sum ego. The Indy saphyre blew Her vaynes doth ennew; The orient perle so clere, The whytnesse of her lere; The lusty ruby ruddes Resemble the rose buddes; Her lyppes soft and mery Emblomed lyke the chery, It were an heuenly blysse Her sugred mouth to kysse. Her beautye to augment, Dame Nature hath her lent A warte vpon her cheke, Who so lyst to seke In her vysage a skar, That semyth from afar Lyke to the radyant star, All with fauour fret, So properly it is set: She is the vyolet, The daysy delectable, The columbine commendable, The ielofer amyable; [For] this most goodly floure, This blossom of fressh colour, So Jupiter me succour, She florysheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Bonitatem fecisti cum servo tuo, domina, Et ex præcordiis sonant præconia! And whan I perceyued Her wart and conceyued, It cannot be denayd But it was well conuayd, And set so womanly, And nothynge wantonly, But ryght conuenyently, And full congruently, As Nature cold deuyse, In most goodly wyse; Who so lyst beholde, It makethe louers bolde To her to sewe for grace, Her fauoure to purchase; The sker upon her chyn, Enhached on her fayre skyn, Whyter than the swan, It wold make any man To forget deadly syn Her fauour to wyn; For this most goodly floure, This blossom of fressh coloure, So Jupiter me socoure, She flouryssheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Defecit in salutatione tua anima mea; Quid petis filio, mater dulcissima? babæ! Soft, and make no dyn, For now I wyll begyn To haue in remembraunce Her goodly dalyaunce, And her goodly pastaunce: So sad and so demure, Behauynge her so sure, With wordes of pleasure She wold make to the lure And any man conuert To gyue her his hole hert. She made me sore amased Vpon her whan I gased, Me thought min hert was crased, My eyne were so dased; For this most goodly flour, This blossom of fressh colour, So Jupyter me socour, She flouryssheth new and new In beauty and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Quomodo dilexi legem tuam, domina! Recedant vetera, nova sint omnia. And to amende her tale, Whan she lyst to auale, And with her fyngers smale, And handes soft as sylke, Whyter than the mylke, That are so quyckely vayned, Wherwyth my hand she strayned, Lorde, how I was payned! Vnneth I me refrayned, How she me had reclaymed, And me to her retayned, Enbrasynge therwithall Her goodly myddell small With sydes longe and streyte; To tell you what conceyte I had than in a tryce, The matter were to nyse, And yet there was no vyce, Nor yet no villany, But only fantasy; For this most goodly floure, This blossom of fressh coloure, So Jupiter me succoure, She floryssheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Iniquos odio habui! Non calumnientur me superbi. But whereto shulde I note How often dyd I tote Vpon her prety fote? It raysed myne hert rote To se her treade the grounde With heles short and rounde. She is playnly expresse Egeria, the goddesse, And lyke to her image, Emportured with corage, A louers pylgrimage; Ther is no beest sauage, Ne no tyger so wood, But she wolde chaunge his mood, Such relucent grace Is formed in her face; For this most goodly floure, This blossome of fresshe coloure, So Jupiter me succour, She flouryssheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Mirabilia testimonia tua! Sicut novellæ plantationes in juventute sua. So goodly as she dresses, So properly she presses The bryght golden tresses Of her heer so fyne, Lyke Phebus beames shyne. Wherto shuld I disclose The garterynge of her hose? It is for to suppose How that she can were Gorgiously her gere; Her fresshe habylementes With other implementes To serue for all ententes, Lyke dame Flora, quene Of lusty somer grene; For this most goodly floure, This blossom of fressh coloure, So Jupiter me socoure, She florisheth new and new In beautye and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Clamavi in toto corde, exaudi me! Misericordia tua magna est super me. Her kyrtell so goodly lased, And vnder that is brased Such plasures that I may Neyther wryte nor say; Yet though I wryte not with ynke, No man can let me thynke, For thought hath lyberte, Thought is franke and fre; To thynke a mery thought It cost me lytell nor nought. Wolde God myne homely style Were pullysshed with the fyle Of Ciceros eloquence, To prase her excellence! For this most goodly floure, This blossome of fressh coloure, So Jupiter me succoure, She flouryssheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina, Principes persecuti sunt me gratis! Omnibus consideratis, Paradisus voluptatis Hæc virgo est dulcissima. My pen it is vnable, My hand it is vnstable, My reson rude and dull To prayse her at the full; Goodly maystres Jane, Sobre, demure Dyane; Jane this maystres hyght The lode star of delyght, Dame Venus of all pleasure, The well of worldly treasure; She doth excede and pas In prudence dame Pallas; [For] this most goodly floure, This blossome of fresshe colour, So Jupiter me socoure, She floryssheth new and new In beaute and vertew: Hac claritate gemina O gloriosa fœmina! Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine! With this psalme, Domine, probasti me, Shall sayle ouer the see, With Tibi, Domine, commendamus, On pylgrimage to saynt Jamys, For shrympes, and for prayns, And for stalkynge cranys; And where my pen hath offendyd, I pray you it may be amendyd By discrete consyderacyon Of your wyse reformacyon; I haue not offended, I trust, If it be sadly dyscust. It were no gentle gyse This treatyse to despyse Because I haue wrytten and sayd Honour of this fayre mayd; Wherefore shulde I be blamed, That I Jane haue named, And famously proclamed? She is worthy to be enrolde With letters of golde. Car elle vault. Per me laurigerum Britonum Skeltonida vatem Laudibus eximiis merito hæc redimita puella est: Formosam cecini, qua non formosior ulla est; Formosam potius quam commendaret Homerus. Sic juvat interdum rigidos recreare labores, Nec minus hoc titulo tersa Minerva mea est. Rien que playsere. Thus endeth the boke of Philip Sparow, and here foloweth an adicyon made by maister Skelton. The gyse now a dayes Of some ianglynge iayes Is to discommende That they cannot amend, Though they wold spend All the wyttes they haue. What ayle them to depraue Phillip Sparowes graue? His Dirige, her Commendacyon Can be no derogacyon, But myrth and consolacyon Made by protestacyon, No man to myscontent With Phillyppes enterement. Alas, that goodly mayd, Why shuld she be afrayde? Why shuld she take shame That her goodly name, Honorably reported, Sholde be set and sorted, To be matriculate With ladyes of estate? I coniure thé, Phillip Sparow, By Hercules that hell dyd harow, And with a venemous arow Slew of the Epidaures One of the Centaures, Or Onocentaures, Or Hipocentaures; By whose myght and mayne An hart was slayne With hornes twayne Of glytteryng gold; And the appels of gold Of Hesperides withhold, And with a dragon kept That neuer more slept, By marcyall strength He wan at length; And slew Gerion With thre bodyes in one; With myghty corage Adauntid the rage Of a lyon sauage; Of Dyomedes stable He brought out a rable Of coursers and rounses With leapes and bounses; And with mighty luggyng, Wrestlyng and tuggyng, He plucked the bull By the horned skull, And offred to Cornucopia; And so forth per cetera: Also by Ecates bower In Plutos gastly tower; By the vgly Eumenides, That neuer haue rest nor ease; By the venemous serpent, That in hell is neuer brent, In Lerna the Grekes fen, That was engendred then; By Chemeras flames, And all the dedly names Of infernall posty, Where soules frye and rosty; By the Stygyall flood, And the streames wood Of Cocitus botumles well; By the feryman of hell, Caron with his beerd hore, That roweth with a rude ore And with his frownsid fore top Gydeth his bote with a prop: I coniure Phylyp, and call In the name of kyng Saul; Primo Regum expresse, He bad the Phitonesse To wytchcraft her to dresse, And by her abusyons, And dampnable illusyons Of marueylus conclusyons, And by her supersticyons, And wonderfull condityons, She raysed vp in that stede Samuell that was dede; But whether it were so, He were idem in numero, The selfe same Samuell, How be it to Saull dyd he tell The Philistinis shuld hym ascry, And the next day he shuld dye, I wyll my selfe dyscharge To lettred men at large: But, Phylyp, I coniure thee Now by these names thre, Diana in the woodes grene, Luna that so bryght doth shene, Procerpina in hell, That thou shortly tell, And shew now vnto me What the cause may be Of this perplexite! Inferias, Philippe, tuas Scroupe pulchra Joanna Instanter petiit: cur nostri carminis illam Nunc pudet? est sero; minor est infamia vero. Than suche as haue disdayned And of this worke complayned, I pray God they be payned No worse than is contayned In verses two or thre That folowe as ye may se. Luride, cur, livor, volucris pia funera damnas? Talia te rapiant rapiunt quæ fata volucrem! Est tamen invidia mors tibi continua. HERE AFTER FOLOWETH THE BOOKE CALLED ELYNOUR RUMMYNGE. THE TUNNYNG OF ELYNOUR RUMMYNG PER SKELTON LAUREAT. Tell you I chyll, If that ye wyll A whyle be styll, Of a comely gyll That dwelt on a hyll: But she is not gryll, For she is somwhat sage And well worne in age; For her vysage It would aswage A mannes courage. Her lothely lere Is nothynge clere, But vgly of chere, Droupy and drowsy, Scuruy and lowsy; Her face all bowsy, Comely crynklyd, Woundersly wrynkled, Lyke a rost pygges eare, Brystled wyth here. Her lewde lyppes twayne, They slauer, men sayne, Lyke a ropy rayne, A gummy glayre: She is vgly fayre; Her nose somdele hoked, And camously croked, Neuer stoppynge, But euer droppynge; Her skynne lose and slacke, Grained lyke a sacke; With a croked backe. Her eyen gowndy Are full vnsowndy, For they are blered; And she gray hered; Jawed lyke a jetty; A man would haue pytty To se how she is gumbed, Fyngered and thumbed, Gently ioynted, Gresed and annoynted Vp to the knockels; The bones [of] her huckels Lyke as they were with buckles Togyther made fast: Her youth is farre past: Foted lyke a plane, Legged lyke a crane; And yet she wyll iet, Lyke a iolly fet, In her furred flocket, And gray russet rocket, With symper the cocket. Her huke of Lyncole grene, It had ben hers, I wene, More then fourty yere; And so doth it apere, For the grene bare thredes Loke like sere wedes, Wyddered lyke hay, The woll worne away; And yet I dare saye She thynketh herselfe gaye Vpon the holy daye, Whan she doth her aray, And gyrdeth in her gytes Stytched and pranked with pletes; Her kyrtel Brystow red, With clothes vpon her hed That wey a sowe of led, Wrythen in wonder wyse, After the Sarasyns gyse, With a whym wham, Knyt with a trym tram, Vpon her brayne pan, Like an Egyptian, Capped about: Whan she goeth out Herselfe for to shewe, She dryueth downe the dewe Wyth a payre of heles As brode as two wheles; She hobles as a gose With her blanket hose Ouer the falowe; Her shone smered wyth talowe, Gresed vpon dyrt That baudeth her skyrt. Primus passus. And this comely dame, I vnderstande, her name Is Elynour Rummynge, At home in her wonnynge; And as men say She dwelt in Sothray, In a certayne stede Bysyde Lederhede. She is a tonnysh gyb; The deuyll and she be syb. But to make vp my tale, She breweth noppy ale, And maketh therof port sale To trauellars, to tynkers, To sweters, to swynkers, And all good ale drynkers, That wyll nothynge spare, But drynke till they stare And brynge themselfe bare, With, Now away the mare, And let vs sley care, As wyse as an hare! Come who so wyll To Elynour on the hyll, Wyth, Fyll the cup, fyll, And syt there by styll, Erly and late: Thyther cometh Kate, Cysly, and Sare, With theyr legges bare, And also theyr fete Hardely full vnswete; Wyth theyr heles dagged, Theyr kyrtelles all to-iagged, Theyr smockes all to-ragged, Wyth tytters and tatters, Brynge dysshes and platters, Wyth all theyr myght runnynge To Elynour Rummynge, To haue of her tunnynge: She leneth them on the same, And thus begynneth the game. Some wenches come vnlased, Some huswyues come vnbrased, Wyth theyr naked pappes, That flyppes and flappes; It wygges and it wagges, Lyke tawny saffron bagges; A sorte of foule drabbes All scuruy with scabbes: Some be flybytten, Some skewed as a kytten; Some wyth a sho clout Bynde theyr heddes about; Some haue no herelace, Theyr lockes about theyr face, Theyr tresses vntrust, All full of vnlust; Some loke strawry, Some cawry mawry; Full vntydy tegges, Lyke rotten egges. Suche a lewde sorte To Elynour resorte From tyde to tyde: Abyde, abyde, And to you shall be tolde Howe hyr ale is solde To Mawte and to Molde. Secundus passus. Some haue no mony That thyder commy, For theyr ale to pay, That is a shreud aray; Elynour swered, Nay, Ye shall not beare away My ale for nought, By hym that me bought! With, Hey, dogge, hay, Haue these hogges away! With, Get me a staffe, The swyne eate my draffe! Stryke the hogges with a clubbe, They haue dronke vp my swyllynge tubbe! For, be there neuer so much prese, These swyne go to the hye dese, The sowe with her pygges; The bore his tayle wrygges, His rumpe also he frygges Agaynst the hye benche! With, Fo, ther is a stenche! Gather vp, thou wenche; Seest thou not what is fall? Take vp dyrt and all, And bere out of the hall: God gyue it yll preuynge Clenly as yuell cheuynge! But let vs turne playne, There we lefte agayne. For, as yll a patch as that, The hennes ron in the mashfat; For they go to roust Streyght ouer the ale ioust, And donge, whan it commes, In the ale tunnes. Than Elynour taketh The mashe bolle, and shaketh The hennes donge away, And skommeth it into a tray Whereas the yeest is, With her maungy fystis: And somtyme she blennes The donge of her hennes And the ale together; And sayeth, Gossyp, come hyther, This ale shal be thycker, And flowre the more quicker; For I may tell you, I lerned it of a Jewe, Whan I began to brewe, And I haue founde it trew; Drinke now whyle it is new; And ye may it broke, It shall make you loke Yonger than ye be Yeres two or thre, For ye may proue it by me; Beholde, she sayde, and se How bryght I am of ble! Ich am not cast away, That can my husband say, Whan we kys and play In lust and in lykyng; He calleth me his whytyng, His mullyng and his mytyng, His nobbes and his conny, His swetyng and his honny, With, Bas, my prety bonny, Thou art worth good and monny. This make I my falyre fonny, Til that he dreme and dronny; For, after all our sport, Than wyll he rout and snort; Than swetely together we ly, As two pygges in a sty. To cease me semeth best, And of this tale to rest, And for to leue this letter, Because it is no better, And because it is no swetter; We wyll no farther ryme Of it at this tyme; But we wyll turne playne Where we left agayne. Tertius passus. Instede of coyne and monny, Some brynge her a conny, And some a pot with honny, Some a salt, and some a spone, Some theyr hose, some theyr shone; Some ran a good trot With a skellet or a pot; Some fyll theyr pot full Of good Lemster woll: An huswyfe of trust, Whan she is athrust, Suche a webbe can spyn, Her thryft is full thyn. Some go streyght thyder, Be it slaty or slyder; They holde the hye waye, They care not what men say, Be that as be maye; Some, lothe to be espyde, Start in at the backe syde, Ouer the hedge and pale, And all for the good ale. Some renne tyll they swete, Brynge wyth them malte or whete, And dame Elynour entrete To byrle them of the best. Than cometh an other gest; She swered by the rode of rest, Her lyppes are so drye, Without drynke she must dye; Therefore fyll it by and by, And haue here a pecke of ry. Anone cometh another, As drye as the other, And wyth her doth brynge Mele, salte, or other thynge, Her haruest gyrdle, her weddynge rynge, To pay for her scot As cometh to her lot. Som bryngeth her husbandes hood, Because the ale is good; Another brought her his cap To offer to the ale tap, Wyth flaxe and wyth towe; And some brought sowre dowe; Wyth, Hey, and wyth, howe, Syt we downe a rowe, And drynke tyll we blowe, And pype tyrly tyrlowe! Some layde to pledge Theyr hatchet and theyr wedge, Theyr hekell and theyr rele, Theyr rocke, theyr spynnyng whele; And some went so narrowe, They layde to pledge theyr wharrowe, Theyr rybskyn and theyr spyndell, Theyr nedell and theyr thymbell: Here was scant thryft Whan they made suche shyft. Theyr thrust was so great, They asked neuer for mete, But drynke, styll drynke, And let the cat wynke, Let vs washe our gommes From the drye crommes. Quartus passus. Some for very nede Layde downe a skeyne of threde, And some a skeyne of yarne; Some brought from the barne Both benes and pease; Small chaffer doth ease Sometyme, now and than: Another there was that ran With a good brasse pan; Her colour was full wan; She ran in all the hast Vnbrased and vnlast; Tawny, swart, and sallowe, Lyke a cake of tallowe; I swere by all hallow, It was a stale to take The deuyll in a brake. And than came haltyng Jone, And brought a gambone Of bakon that was resty: But, Lorde, as she was testy, Angry as a waspy! She began to yane and gaspy, And bad Elynour go bet, And fyll in good met; It was dere that was farre fet. Another brought a spycke Of a bacon flycke; Her tonge was verye quycke, But she spake somwhat thycke: Her felow did stammer and stut, But she was a foule slut, For her mouth fomyd And her bely groned: Jone sayne she had eaten a fyest; By Christ, sayde she, thou lyest, I haue as swete a breth As thou, wyth shamfull deth! Than Elynour sayde, Ye callettes, I shall breake your palettes, Wythout ye now cease! And so was made the peace. Than thyder came dronken Ales; And she was full of tales, Of tydynges in Wales, And of sainct James in Gales, And of the Portyngales; Wyth, Lo, gossyp, I wys, Thus and thus it is, There hath ben great war Betwene Temple Bar And the Crosse in Chepe, And there came an hepe Of mylstones in a route: She speketh thus in her snout, Sneuelyng in her nose, As thoughe she had the pose; Lo, here is an olde typpet, And ye wyll gyue me a syppet Of your stale ale, God sende you good sale! And as she was drynkynge, She fyll in a wynkynge Wyth a barlyhood, She pyst where she stood; Than began she to wepe, And forthwyth fell on slepe. Elynour toke her vp, And blessed her wyth a cup Of newe ale in cornes; Ales founde therin no thornes, But supped it vp at ones, She founde therin no bones. Quintus passus. Nowe in cometh another rabell; Fyrst one wyth a ladell, Another wyth a cradell, And wyth a syde sadell: And there began a fabell, A clatterynge and a babell Of folys fylly That had a fole wyth wylly, With, Iast you, and, gup, gylly! She coulde not lye stylly. Then came in a genet, And sware by saynct Benet, I dranke not this sennet A draught to my pay; Elynour, I thé pray, Of thyne ale let vs assay, And haue here a pylche of gray; I were skynnes of conny, That causeth I loke so donny. Another than dyd hyche her, And brought a pottel pycher, A tonnel, and a bottell, But she had lost the stoppell; She cut of her sho sole, And stopped therwyth the hole. Amonge all the blommer, Another brought a skommer, A fryinge pan, and a slyce; Elynour made the pryce For good ale eche whyt. Than sterte in mad Kyt, That had lyttle wyt; She semed somdele seke, And brought a peny cheke To dame Elynour, For a draught of lycour. Than Margery Mylkeducke Her kyrtell she did vptucke An ynche aboue her kne, Her legges that ye myght se; But they were sturdy and stubbed, Myghty pestels and clubbed, As fayre and as whyte As the fote of a kyte: She was somwhat foule, Crokenecked lyke an oule; And yet she brought her fees, A cantell of Essex chese Was well a fote thycke, Full of maggottes quycke; It was huge and greate, And myghty stronge meate For the deuyll to eate; It was tart and punyete. Another sorte of sluttes, Some brought walnuttes, Some apples, some peres, Some brought theyr clyppynge sheres, Some brought this and that, Some brought I wote nere what, Some brought theyr husbandes hat, Some podynges and lynkes, Some trypes that stynkes. But of all this thronge One came them amonge, She semed halfe a leche, And began to preche Of the tewsday in the weke Whan the mare doth keke; Of the vertue of an vnset leke; Of her husbandes breke; Wyth the feders of a quale She could to Burdeou sayle; And wyth good ale barme She could make a charme To helpe wythall a stytch. She semed to be a wytch. Another brought two goslynges, That were noughty froslynges; She brought them in a wallet, She was a cumly callet: The goslenges were untyde; Elynour began to chyde, They be wretchockes thou hast brought, They are shyre shakyng nought! Sextus passus. Maude Ruggy thyther skypped: She was vgly hypped, And vgly thycke lypped, Lyke an onyon syded, Lyke tan ledder hyded: She had her so guyded Betwene the cup and the wall, That she was there wythall Into a palsey fall; Wyth that her hed shaked, And her handes quaked: Ones hed wold haue aked To se her naked: She dranke so of the dregges, The dropsy was in her legges; Her face glystryng lyke glas; All foggy fat she was; She had also the gout In all her ioyntes about; Her breth was soure and stale, And smelled all of ale: Suche a bedfellaw Wold make one cast his craw; But yet for all that She dranke on the mash fat. There came an old rybybe; She halted of a kybe, And had broken her shyn At the threshold comyng in, And fell so wyde open That one myght se her token, The deuyll thereon be wroken! What nede all this be spoken? She yelled lyke a calfe: Ryse vp, on Gods halfe, Said Elynour Rummyng, I beshrew thé for thy cummyng! And as she at her did pluck, Quake, quake, sayd the duck In that lampatrams lap; Wyth, Fy, couer thy shap Wyth sum flyp flap! God gyue it yll hap, Sayde Elynour for shame, Lyke an honest dame. Vp she stert, halfe lame, And skantly could go For payne and for wo. In came another dant, Wyth a gose and a gant: She had a wide wesant; She was nothynge plesant; Necked lyke an olyfant; It was a bullyfant, A gredy cormerant. Another brought her garlyke hedes; Another brought her bedes Of iet or of cole, To offer to the ale pole: Some brought a wymble, Some brought a thymble, Some brought a sylke lace, Some brought a pyncase, Some her husbandes gowne, Some a pyllow of downe, Some of the napery; And all this shyfte they make For the good ale sake. A strawe, sayde Bele, stande vtter, For we haue egges and butter, And of pygeons a payre. Than sterte forth a fysgygge, And she brought a bore pygge; The fleshe therof was ranke, And her brethe strongly stanke, Yet, or she went, she dranke, And gat her great thanke Of Elynour for her ware, That she thyther bare To pay for her share. Now truly, to my thynkynge; This is a solempne drinkynge. Septimus passus. Soft, quod one, hyght Sybbyll, And let me wyth you bybyll. She sat downe in the place, With a sory face Wheywormed about; Garnyshed was her snout Wyth here and there a puscull, Lyke a scabbyd muscull. This ale, sayde she, is noppy; Let vs syppe and soppy, And not spyll a droppy, For so mote I hoppy, It coleth well my croppy. Dame Elynoure, sayde she, Haue here is for me, A cloute of London pynnes; And wyth that she begynnes The pot to her plucke, And dranke a good lucke; She swynged vp a quarte At ones for her parte; Her paunche was so puffed, And so wyth ale stuffed, Had she not hyed apace, She had defoyled the place. Than began the sporte Amonge that dronken sorte: Dame Eleynour, sayde they, Lende here a cocke of hey, To make all thynge cleane; Ye wote well what we meane. But, syr, among all That sat in that hall, There was a pryckemedenty, Sat lyke a seynty, And began to paynty, As thoughe she would faynty; She made it as koy As a lege de moy; She was not halfe so wyse As she was peuysshe nyse. She sayde neuer a worde, But rose from the borde, And called for our dame, Elynour by name. We supposed, I wys, That she rose to pys; But the very grounde Was for to compounde Wyth Elynour in the spence, To pay for her expence: I haue no penny nor grote To pay, sayde she, God wote, For washyng of my throte; But my bedes of amber Bere them to your chamber. Then Elynour dyd them hyde Wythin her beddes syde. But some than sat ryght sad That nothynge had There of theyr awne, Neyther gelt nor pawne; Suche were there menny That had not a penny, But, whan they should walke, Were fayne wyth a chalke To score on the balke, Or score on the tayle: God gyue it yll hayle! For my fyngers ytche; I haue wrytten to mytche Of this mad mummynge Of Elynour Rummynge. Thus endeth the gest Of this worthy fest. Quod Skelton, Laureat. POEMS AGAINST GARNESCHE.

But sey me yet, Syr Satropas, what auctoryte ye haue In your chalange, Syr Chesten, to calle me a knaue?

Whan ye war yonger of age, Ye war a kechyn page, A dyshwasher, a dryvyll, In the pott your nose dedde sneuyll; Ye fryed and ye broylyd, Ye rostyd and ye boylyd, Ye rostyd, lyke a fonne, A gose with the fete vponne; Ye slvfferd vp sowse In my lady Brewsys howse.

At Gynys when ye ware But a slendyr spere, Dekkyd lewdly in your gere; For when ye dwelt there, Ye had a knauysche cote Was skantly worthe a grote; In dud frese ye war schrynyd, With better frese lynyd; The oute syde euery day, Ye myght no better a way; The insyde ye ded calle Your best gowne festyvalle.

Bolde bayarde, ye are to blynde, And grow all oute of kynde, To occupy so your mynde; For reson can I non fynde Nor good ryme in yower mater; I wondyr that ye smatyr, So for a knaue to clatyr; Ye wolde be callyd a maker, And make moche lyke Jake Rakar; Ye ar a comly crakar, Ye lernyd of sum py bakar.

Quid detur tibi, aut quid apponatur tibi ad linguam dolosam? Psalm. c. xlij. Deus destruet te in finem; evellet te, et emigrabit te de tabernaculo tuo, et radicem tuam de terra viventium. Psal. lxvii. Al maters wel pondred and wel to be regarded, How shuld a fals lying tung then be rewarded? Such tunges shuld be torne out by the harde rootes, Hoyning like hogges that groynis and wrotes. Dilexisti omnia verba præcipitationis, lingua dolosa. Ubi s. &amp;c. For, as I haue rede in volumes olde, A fals lying tunge is harde to withholde; A sclaunderous tunge, a tunge of a skolde, Worketh more mischiefe than can be tolde; That, if I wist not to be controlde, Yet somwhat to say I dare well be bolde, How some delite for to lye thycke and threfolde. Ad sannam hominem redigit comice et graphice. For ye said, that he said, that I said, wote ye what? I made, he said, a windmil of an olde mat: If there be none other mater but that, Than ye may commaunde me to gentil Cok wat. Hic notat purpuraria arte intextas literas Romanas in amictibus post ambulonum ante et retro.

Pædagogium meum male sanos maledicos sibilis complosisque manibus explodit, &amp;c. My scoles are not for vnthriftes vntaught, For frantick faitours half mad and half straught; But my learning is of an other degree To taunt theim like liddrous, lewde as thei bee. Laxent ergo antennam elationis suæ inflatam vento vanitatis. li. ille, &amp;c. For though some be lidder, and list for to rayle, Yet to lie vpon me they can not preuayle: Then let them vale a bonet of their proud sayle, And of their taunting toies rest with il hayle. Nobilitati ignobilis cedat vilitas, &amp;c. There is no noble man wil iudge in me Any such foly to rest or to be: I care muche the lesse what euer they say, For tunges vntayde be renning astray; But yet I may say safely, so many wel lettred Embraudred, enlasid together, and fettred, And so little learning, so lewdly alowed, What fault find ye herein but may be auowed? But ye are so full of vertibilite, And of frenetyke folabilite, And of melancoly mutabilite, That ye would coarte and enforce me Nothing to write, but hay the gy of thre, And I to suffre you lewdly to ly Of me with your language full of vilany!

Quicquid loquantur, ut effœminantur, ita effantur &amp;c. Somtime women were put in great blame, Men said they could not their tunges atame; But men take vpon theim nowe all the shame, With skolding and sklaundering make their tungs lame. Novarum rerum cupidissimi, captatores, delatores, adulatores, invigilatores, deliratores, &amp;c. id genus. li. ille. For men be now tratlers and tellers of tales; What tidings at Totnam, what newis in Wales, What shippis are sailing to Scalis Malis? And all is not worth a couple of nut shalis: But lering and lurking here and there like spies; The deuil tere their tunges and pike out their ies! Then ren they with lesinges and blow them about, With, He wrate suche a bil withouten dout; With, I can tel you what such a man said; And you knew all, ye would be ill apayd.

But if that I knewe what his name hight, For clatering of me I would him sone quight; For his false lying, of that I spake neuer, I could make him shortly repent him for euer: Although he made it neuer so tough, He might be sure to haue shame ynough. Cerberus horrendo barathri latrando sub antro Te rodatque voret, lingua dolosa, precor.

Recipit se scripturum opus sanctum, laudabile, acceptabile, memorabileque, et nimis honorificandum. Disperdat Dominus universa labia dolosa et linguam magniloquam! [Ye may here now, in this ryme] Ye may here now, in this ryme, How euery thing must haue a tyme. Tyme is a thing that no man may resyst; Tyme is trancytory and irreuocable; Who sayeth the contrary, tyme passeth as hym lyst; Tyme must be taken in season couenable; Take tyme when tyme is, for tyme is ay mutable; All thynge hath tyme, who can for it prouyde; Byde for tyme who wyll, for tyme wyll no man byde. Tyme to be sad, and tyme to play and sporte; Tyme to take rest by way of recreacion; Tyme to study, and tyme to use comfort; Tyme of pleasure, and tyme of consolation: Thus tyme hath his tyme of diuers maner facion: Tyme for to eate and drynke for thy repast; Tyme to be lyberall, and tyme to make no wast; Tyme to trauell, and tyme for to rest; Tyme for to speake, and tyme to holde thy pease; Tyme would be vsed when tyme is best; Tyme to begyn, and tyme for to cease; And when tyme is, [to] put thyselfe in prease, And when tyme is, to holde thyselfe abacke; For tyme well spent can neuer haue lacke. The rotys take theyr sap in tyme of vere; In tyme of somer flowres fresh and grene; In tyme of haruest men their corne shere; In tyme of wynter the north wynde waxeth kene, So bytterly bytynge the flowres be not sene; The kalendis of Janus, with his frostes hore, That tyme is when people must lyue vpon the store.

O Maker of mankynde, that formyd day and nyghte, Whose power imperyal comprehendeth euery place! Myne hert, my mynde, my thought, my hole delyght Is, after this lyfe, to see thy glorious face: Whose magnifycence is incomprehensybyll, All argumentes of reason which far doth excede, Whose Deite dowtles is indiuysybyll, From whom all goodnes and vertue doth procede; Of thy support all creatures haue nede: Assyst me, good Lord, and graunte me of thy grace. To lyue to thy pleasure in word, thoughte, and dede, And, after this lyfe, to see thy glorious face. TO THE SECONDE PARSON.

Graunte me, out of this world when I shall go, Thyne endles mercy for my preseruatyue; Agaynst the world, the flesh, the deuyl also, Defende me wyth thy pyteous woundis fyue. TO THE HOLY GOOSTE. O firy feruence, inflamed wyth all grace, Enkyndelyng hertes with brandis charitable, The endles reward of pleasure and solace, To the Father and the Son thou art communicable In unitate which is inseperable! O water of lyfe, O well of consolacion! Agaynst all suggestions dedly and dampnable Rescu me, good Lorde, by your preseruacion: To whome is appropryed the Holy Ghost by name, The Thyrde Parson, one God in Trinite, Of perfyt loue thou art the ghostly flame: O myrrour of mekenes, pease, and tranquylyte, My confort, my counsell, my parfyt charyte! O water of lyfe, O well of consolacion! Agaynst all stormys of harde aduersyte Rescu me, good Lord, by thy preseruacion. Amen. Quod Skelton, Laureat. [Woffully araid] Woffully araid, My blode, man, For thé ran, It may not be naid; My body bloo and wan, Woffully araid. Beholde me, I pray thé, with all thi hole reson, And be not so hard hartid, and ffor this encheson, Sith I for thi sowle sake was slayne in good seson, Begylde and betraide by Judas fals treson; Vnkyndly entretid, With sharpe corde sore fretid, The Jewis me thretid, They mowid, they grynned, they scornyd me, Condempnyd to deth, as thou maist se, Woffully araid. Thus nakyd am I nailid, O man, for thy sake! I loue thé, then loue me; why slepist thou? awake! Remembir my tendir hart rote for thé brake, With panys my vaynys constreyn[e]d to crake; Thus toggid to and fro, Thus wrappid all in woo, Whereas neuer man was so, Entretid thus in most cruell wyse, Was like a lombe offerd in sacrifice, Woffully araid. Off sharpe thorne I haue worne a crowne on my hede, So paynyd, so straynyd, so rufull, so red; Thus bobbid, thus robbid, thus for thy loue ded, Onfaynyd not deynyd my blod for to shed; My fete and handes sore The sturdy nailis bore; What my?t I suffir more Than I haue don, O man, for thé?

[Now synge we, as we were wont] Now synge we, as we were wont, Vexilla regis prodeunt.

Beholde my shankes, behold my knees, Beholde my hed, armes, and thees, Beholde of me nothyng thou sees But sorowe and pyne; Thus was I spylt, Man, for thy gylte, And not for myne. Now synge we, &amp;c. Behold my body, how Jewes it donge With knots of whipcord and scourges strong; As stremes of a well the blode out sprong On euery syde; The knottes were knyt, Ryght well made with wyt, They made woundes wyde. Now synge we, &amp;c. Man, thou shalt now vnderstand, Of my head, bothe fote and hand, Are four c. and fyue thousand Woundes and sixty; Fifty and vii. Were tolde full euen Vpon my body.

This worke deuysed is For such as do amys; And specyally to controule Such as haue cure of soule, That be so farre abused, They cannot be excused By reason nor by law; But that they play the daw, To hawke, or els to hunt From the aulter to the funte, With cry vnreuerent, Before the sacrament, Within the holy church bowndis, That of our faith the grounde is. That pryest that hawkys so, All grace is farre him fro; He semeth a sysmatyke, Or els an heretyke, For fayth in him is faynte. Therefore to make complaynte Of such mysaduysed Parsons and dysgysed, This boke we haue deuysed, Compendiously comprysed, No good priest to offende, But suche dawes to amende, In hope that no man shall Be myscontent withall. I shall you make relacion, By waye of apostrofacion, Vnder supportacion Of youre pacyent tolleracion, How I, Skelton Laureat, Deuysed and also wrate Vpon a lewde curate, A parson benyfyced, But nothing well aduysed: He shall be as now nameles, But he shall not be blameles, Nor he shal not be shameles; For sure he wrought amys, To hawke in my church of Dis. This fonde frantyke fauconer, With his polutid pawtenar, As priest vnreuerent; Streyght to the sacrament He made his hawke to fly, With hogeous showte and cry. The hye auter he strypt naked; There on he stode, and craked; He shoke downe all the clothis, And sware horrible othes Before the face of God, By Moyses and Arons rod, Or that he thens yede, His hawke shoulde pray and fede Vpon a pigeons maw. The bloude ran downe raw Vpon the auter stone; The hawke tyrid on a bonne; And in the holy place She mutid there a chase Vpon my corporas face. Such sacrificium laudis He made with suche gambawdis. OBSERVATE. His seconde hawke wexid gery, And was with flying wery; She had flowin so oft, That on the rode loft She perkyd her to rest. The fauconer then was prest, Came runnyng with a dow, And cryed, Stow, stow, stow! But she would not bow. He then, to be sure, Callid her with a lure. Her mete was very crude, She had not wel endude; She was not clene ensaymed, She was not well reclaymed: But the fawconer vnfayned Was much more febler brayned. The hawke had no lyst To come to hys fyst; She loked as she had the frounce; With that he gaue her a bounce Full vpon the gorge: I wyll not fayne nor forge; The hawke with that clap Fell downe with euyll hap. The church dores were sparred, Fast boltyd and barryd, Yet wyth a prety gyn I fortuned to come in, This rebell to beholde, Wherof I hym controlde; But he sayde that he woulde, Agaynst my mynde and wyll, In my churche hawke styll. CONSIDERATE. On Sainct John decollacion He hawked on this facion, Tempore vesperarum, Sed non secundum Sarum, But lyke a Marche harum, His braynes were so parum. He sayde he would not let His houndis for to fet, To hunte there by lyberte In the dyspyte of me, And to halow there the fox: Downe went my offerynge box, Boke, bell, and candyll, All that he myght handyll: Cros, staffe, lectryne, and banner, Fell downe on this manner. DELIBERATE. With, troll, cytrace, and trouy, They ranged, hankin bouy, My churche all aboute. This fawconer then gan showte, These be my gospellers, These be my pystillers, These be my querysters, To helpe me to synge, My hawkes to mattens rynge. In this priestly gydynge His hawke then flew vppon The rode with Mary and John. Delt he not lyke a fon? Delt he not lyke a daw? Or els is this Goddes law, Decrees or decretals, Or holy sinodals, Or els prouincials, Thus within the wals Of holy church to deale, Thus to rynge a peale With his hawkis bels? Dowtles such losels Make the churche to be In smale auctoryte: A curate in speciall To snappar and to fall Into this open cryme; To loke on this were tyme. VIGILATE. But who so that lokys In the officiallis bokis, Ther he may se and reed That this is matter indeed. How be it, mayden Meed Made theym to be agreed, And so the Scrybe was feed, And the Pharasay Than durst nothing say, But let the matter slyp, And made truth to trip; And of the spiritual law They made but a gewgaw, And toke it out in drynke, And this the cause doth shrynke: The church is thus abused, Reproched and pollutyd: Correccion hath no place, And all for lacke of grace. DEPLORATE. Loke now in Exodi, And de arca Domini, With Regum by and by; The Bybyll wyll not ly; How the Temple was kept, How the Temple was swept, Where sanguis taurorum, Aut sanguis vitulorum, Was offryd within the wallis, After ceremoniallis; When it was poluted, Sentence was executed, By wey of expiacion, For reconciliacion. DIVINITATE. Then muche more, by the rode, Where Christis precious blode Dayly offred is, To be poluted this; And that he wyshed withall That the dowues donge downe might fal Into my chalis at mas, When consecrated was The blessed sacrament: O prieest vnreuerent! He sayde that he woulde hunt From the aulter to the funt. REFORMATE. Of no tyrande I rede, That so farre dyd excede; Neyther yet Dioclesyan, Nor yet Domisian, Nor yet croked Cacus, Nor yet dronken Bacus; Nother Olibrius, Nor Dionisyus; Nother Phalary, Rehersed in Valery; Nor Sardanapall, Vnhappiest of all; Nor Nero the worst, Nor Clawdius the curst; Nor yet Egeas, Nor yet Syr Pherumbras; Nother Zorobabell, Nor cruel Jesabell; Nor yet Tarquinius, Whom Tytus Liuius In wrytynge doth enroll; I haue red them poll by poll; The story of Arystobell, And of Constantinopell, Whiche citye miscreantys wan, And slew many a Christen man; Yet the Sowden, nor the Turke, Wrought neuer suche a worke, For to let theyr hawkes fly In the Church of Saint Sophy; With much matter more, That I kepe in store. PENSITATE. Then in a tabull playne I wroute a verse or twayne, Whereat he made dysdayne: The pekysh parsons brayne Cowde not rech nor attayne What the sentence ment; He sayde, for a crokid intent The wordes were paruerted: And this he ouerthwarted. Of the which proces Ye may know more expres, If it please you to loke In the resydew of this boke. Here after followeth the tabull. Loke on this tabull, Whether thou art abull To rede or to spell What these verses tell. Sicculo lutueris est colo b?raar?

Agaynst the prowde Scottes clatterynge, That neuer wyll leaue theyr tratlynge: Wan they the felde, and lost theyr kynge? They may well say, fye on that wynnynge! Lo, these fonde sottes And tratlynge Scottes, How thei are blynde In theyr owne mynde, And wyll not know Theyr ouerthrow At Branxton more! They are so stowre, So frantyke mad, They say they had And wan the felde With spere and shelde: That is as trew As blacke is blew And grene is gray. What euer they say, Jemmy is ded And closed in led, That was theyr owne kynge: Fy on that wynnynge! At Floddon hyllys Our bowys, our byllys, Slewe all the floure Of theyr honoure. Are not these Scottys Folys and sottys, Suche boste to make, To prate and crake, To face, to brace, All voyde of grace, So prowde of hart, So ouerthwart, So out of frame, So voyde of shame, As it is enrolde, Wrytten and tolde Within this quayre? Who lyst to repayre, And therein reed, Shall fynde indeed A mad rekenynge, Consyderynge al thynge, That the Scottis may synge Fy on the wynnynge! When the Scotte lyued. Joly Jemmy, ye scorneful Scot, Is it come vnto your lot A solempne sumner for to be? It greyth nought for your degre Our kynge of Englande for to syght, Your souerayne lord, our prynce of might: Ye for to sende such a citacion, It shameth all your noughty nacion, In comparyson but kynge Koppynge Vnto our prince, annoynted kynge. Ye play Hob Lobbyn of Lowdean; Ye shew ryght well what good ye can; Ye may be lorde of Locrian,— Chryst sence you with a frying pan!— Of Edingborrow and Saint Ionis towne: Adieu, syr sumner, cast of youre crowne! When the Scot was slayne. Continually I shall remember The mery moneth of September, With the ix daye of the same, For then began our myrth and game; So that now I haue deuysed, And in my minde I haue comprysed, Of the prowde Scot, kynge Jemmy, To wryte some lyttle tragedy, For no maner consyderacion Of any sorowful lamentacion, But for the special consolacion Of all our royall Englysh nacion. Melpomone, O Muse tragediall, Vnto your grace for grace now I call, To guyde my pen and my pen to enbybe! Illumyn me, your poete and your scrybe, That with myxture of aloes and bytter gall I may compounde confectures for a cordiall, To angre the Scottes and Irysh keteringes withall, That late were discomfect with battayle marcyall. Thalia, my Muse, for you also call I, To touche them with tauntes of your armony, A medley to make of myrth with sadnes, The hartes of England to comfort with gladnes: And now to begyn I wyll me adres, To you rehersynge the somme of my proces. Kynge Jamy, Jemmy, Jocky my jo, Ye summond our kynge,—why dyd ye so? To you nothing it dyd accorde To summon our kynge, your soueraygne lord. A kyng, a sumner! it was great wonder: Know ye not suger and salt asonder? Your sumner to saucy, to malapert, Your harrold in armes not yet halfe experte. Ye thought ye dyd yet valyauntly, Not worth thre skyppes of a pye: Syr skyrgalyard, ye were so skyt, Your wyll than ran before your wyt. Your lege ye layd and your aly, Your frantick fable not worth a fly, Frenche kynge, or one or other; Regarded ye should your lord, your brother. Trowid ye, Syr Jemy, his nobul grace From you, Syr Scot, would turne his face? With, Gup, Syr Scot of Galawey! Now is your pryde fall to decay. Male vryd was your fals entent For to offende your presydent, Your souerayne lord most reuerent, Your lord, your brother, and your regent. In him is fygured Melchisedec, And ye were disloyall Amalec. He is our noble Scipione, Annoynted kynge; and ye were none, Thoughe ye vntruly your father haue slayne. His tytle is true in Fraunce to raygne; And ye, proud Scot, Dunde, Dunbar, Pardy, ye were his homager, And suter to his parliament: For your vntruth now ar ye shent. Ye bare yourselfe somwhat to bold, Therfore ye lost your copyehold; Ye were bonde tenent to his estate; Lost is your game, ye are checkmate. Vnto the castell of Norram, I vnderstande, to sone ye came. At Branxston more and Flodden hylles, Our Englysh bowes, our Englysh bylles, Agaynst you gaue so sharpe a shower, That of Scotland ye lost the flower. The Whyte Lyon, there rampaunt of moode, He ragyd and rent out your hart bloode; He the Whyte, and ye the Red, The Whyte there slew the Red starke ded. Thus for your guerdon quyt ar ye, Thanked be God in Trinite, And swete Sainct George, our ladies knyght! Your eye is out; adew, good nyght! Ye were starke mad to make a fray, His grace beyng out of the way: But, by the power and might of God, For your owne tayle ye made a rod. Ye wanted wit, syr, at a worde; Ye lost your spurres, ye lost your sworde. Ye myght haue buskyd you to Huntley bankys; Your pryde was peuysh to play such prankys: Your pouerte coude not attayne With our kynge royal war to mayntayne. Of the kyng of Nauerne ye might take heed, Vngraciously how he doth speed: In double delynge so he did dreme, That he is kynge without a reme; And, for example ye would none take, Experiens hath brought you in suche a brake. Your welth, your ioy, your sport, your play, Your bragynge bost, your royal aray, Your beard so brym as bore at bay, Your Seuen Systers, that gun so gay, All haue ye lost and cast away. Thus fortune hath tourned you, I dare well saye, Now from a kynge to a clot of clay: Out of your robes ye were shaked, And wretchedly ye lay starke naked. For lacke of grace hard was your hap: The Popes curse gaue you that clap. Of the out yles the roughe foted Scottes, We haue well eased them of the bottes: The rude ranke Scottes, lyke dronken dranes, At Englysh bowes haue fetched theyr banes. It is not fytting in tower and towne A sumner to were a kynges crowne: Fortune on you therfore did frowne; Ye were to hye, ye are cast downe. Syr sumner, now where is your crowne? Cast of your crowne, cast vp your crowne! Syr sumner, now ye haue lost your crowne. Quod Skelton laureate, oratoure to the Kynges most royall estate.

VNTO DIUERS PEOPLE THAT REMORD THIS RYMYNGE AGAYNST THE SCOT JEMMY. I am now constrayned, With wordes nothynge fayned, This inuectiue to make, For some peoples sake That lyst for to iangyll And waywardly to wrangyll Agaynst this my makynge, Their males therat shakynge, At it reprehending, And venemously stingynge, Rebukynge and remordyng, And nothing according. Cause haue they none other, But for that he was brother, Brother vnnatural Vnto our kynge royall, Against whom he dyd fighte Falsly agaynst all ryght, Lyke that vntrue rebell Fals Kayn agaynst Abell. Who so therat pyketh mood, The tokens are not good To be true Englysh blood; For, yf they vnderstood His traytourly dispyght, He was a recrayed knyght, A subtyll sysmatyke, Ryght nere an heretyke, Of grace out of the state, And died excomunycate. And for he was a kynge, The more shamefull rekemynge Of hym should men report, In ernest and in sport. He skantly loueth our kynge, That grudgeth at this thing: That cast such ouerthwartes Percase haue hollow hartes. Si veritatem dico, quare non creditis mihi: VILITISSIMUS SCOTUS DUNDAS ALLEGAT CAUDAS CONTRA ANGLIGENAS. Caudatos Anglos, spurcissime Scote, quid effers? Effrons es, quoque sons, mendax, tua spurcaque bucca est. Anglicus a tergo caudam gerit; est canis ergo. Anglice caudate, cape caudam ne cadat a te. Ex causa caudæ manet Anglica gens sine laude. Diffamas patriam, qua non est melior usquam. Cum cauda plaudis dum possis, ad ostia pultas Mendicans; mendicus eris, mendaxque bilinguis, Scabidus, horribilis, quem vermes sexque pedales Corrodunt misere; miseris genus est maledictum.

By Jesu Christ, Fals Scot, thou lyest: But behynd in our hose We bere there a rose For thy Scottyshe nose, A spectacle case To couer thy face, With tray deux ase.

But thou lakest might, Dundas, dronken and drowsy, Skabed, scuruy, and lowsy, Of vnhappy generacion And most vngracious nacion.

THE BOKE OF THREE FOOLES. M. SKELTON, POETE LAUREATE, GAUE TO MY LORD CARDYNALL. THE FYRST FOOLE. The man that doth wed a wyfe For her goodes and her rychesse, And not for lygnage femynatyfe, Procureth doloure and dystresse, With infynyte payne and heuynesse; For she wyll do hym moche sorowe, Bothe at euyn and at morowe. THE SECONDE FOOLE. The dartes ryght cursed of Enuye Hath rayned sythe the worlde began, Whiche bryngeth man euydently Into the bondes of Sathan; Wherfore he is a dyscrete man That can eschewe that euyll synne Where body and soule is lost in. THE THYRD FOOLE. Dyuers by voluptuousnes Of women, the which be present, Be brought into full great dystres, Forgettyng vertues excellent Of God, the whych is permanent, And suffreth themselfe to be bounde In cordes, as it were a hounde. A replycacion agaynst certayne yong scholers abiured of late, &amp;c. [A lytell ragge of rethorike] A lytell ragge of rethorike, A lesse lumpe of logyke, A pece or a patche of philosophy, Than forthwith by and by They tumble so in theology, Drowned in dregges of diuinite, That they iuge them selfe able to be Doctours of the chayre in the Uyntre At the Thre Cranes, To magnifye their names: But madly it frames, For all that they preche and teche Is farther than their wytte wyll reche. Thus by demeryttes of their abusyon, Finally they fall to carefull confusyon, To beare a fagot, or to be enflamed: Thus are they vndone and vtterly shamed. [To the honour of our blessed lady] To the honour of our blessed lady, And her most blessed baby, I purpose for to reply Agaynst this horryble heresy Of these yong heretikes, that stynke vnbrent, Whom I nowe sommon and content, That leudly haue their tyme spent, In their study abhomynable, Our glorious lady to disable, And heynously on her to bable With langage detestable; With your lyppes polluted Agaynst her grace disputed, Whiche is the most clere christall Of all pure clennesse virgynall, That our Sauyour bare, Whiche vs redemed from care. I saye, thou madde Marche hare, I wondre howe ye dare Open your ianglyng iawes, To preche in any clawes, Lyke pratynge poppyng dawes, Agaynst her excellence, Agaynst her reuerence, Agaynst her preemynence, Agaynst her magnifycence, That neuer dyde offence. Ye heretykes recrayed, Wotte ye what ye sayed Of Mary, mother and mayed? With baudrie at her ye brayed; With baudy wordes vnmete Your tonges were to flete; Your sermon was nat swete; Ye were nothyng discrete; Ye were in a dronken hete. Lyke heretykes confettred, Ye count yourselfe wele lettred: Your lernyng is starke nought, For shamefully ye haue wrought, And to shame your selfe haue brought. Bycause ye her mysnamed, And wolde haue her defamed, Your madnesse she attamed; For ye were worldly shamed, At Poules crosse openly, All men can testifye; There, lyke a sorte of sottes, Ye were fayne to beare fagottes; At the feest of her concepcion Ye suffred suche correction. Sive per æquivocum, Sive per univocum, Sive sic, sive nat so, Ye are brought to, Lo, lo, lo! Se where the heretykes go, Wytlesse wandring to and fro! With, Te he, ta ha, bo ho, bo ho! And suche wondringes many mo. Helas, ye wreches, ye may be wo! Ye may syng wele away, And curse bothe nyght and day, Whan ye were bredde and borne, And whan ye were preestes shorne, Thus to be laughed to skorne, Thus tattred and thus torne, Thorowe your owne foly, To be blowen with the flye Of horryble heresy. Fayne ye were to reny, And mercy for to crye, Or be brende by and by, Confessyng howe ye dyde lye In prechyng shamefully. Your selfe thus ye discured As clerkes vnassured, With ignorance obscured: Ye are vnhappely vred. In your dialeticall And principles silogisticall, If ye to remembrance call Howe syllogisari Non est ex particulari, Neque negativis, Recte concludere si vis, Et cætera id genus, Ye coude nat corde tenus, Nor answere verbo tenus, Whan prelacy you opposed; Your hertes than were hosed, Your relacions reposed; And yet ye supposed. Respondere ad quantum, But ye were confuse tantum, Surrendring your supposycions, For there ye myst you[r] quosshons. Wolde God, for your owne ease, That wyse Harpocrates Had your mouthes stopped, And your tonges cropped, Whan ye logyke chopped, And in the pulpete hopped, And folysshly there fopped, And porisshly forthe popped Your sysmaticate sawes Agaynst Goddes lawes, And shewed your selfe dawes! Ye argued argumentes, As it were vpon the elenkes, De rebus apparentibus Et non existentibus; And ye wolde appere wyse, But ye were folysshe nyse: Yet be meanes of that vyse Ye dyde prouoke and tyse, Oftnar than ones or twyse, Many a good man And many a good woman, By way of their deuocion To helpe you to promocion, Whose charite wele regarded Can nat be vnrewarded. I saye it for no sedicion, But vnder pacient tuicyon, It is halfe a supersticyon To gyue you exhibycion To mainteyne with your skoles, And to proue your selfe suche foles. Some of you had ten pounde, Therwith for to be founde At the vnyuersyte, Employed whiche myght haue be Moche better other wayes. But, as the man sayes, The blynde eteth many a flye: What may be ment hereby, Ye may soone make construction With right lytell instruction; For it is an auncyent brute, Suche apple tre, suche frute. What shulde I prosecute, Or more of this to clatter? Retourne we to our matter. Ye soored ouer hye In the ierarchy Of Iouenyans heresy, Your names to magnifye, Among the scabbed skyes Of Wycliffes flesshe flyes; Ye strynged so Luthers lute, That ye dawns all in a sute The heritykes ragged ray, That bringes you out of the way Of holy churches lay; Ye shayle inter enigmata And inter paradigmata, Marked in your cradels To beare fagottes for babyls. And yet some men say, Howe ye are this day, And be nowe as yll, And so ye wyll be styll, As ye were before. What shulde I recken more? Men haue you in suspicion Howe ye haue small contrycion Of that ye haue myswrought: For, if it were well sought, One of you there was That laughed whan he dyd pas With his fagot in processyon; He counted it for no correction, But with scornefull affection Toke it for a sporte, His heresy to supporte; Whereat a thousande gased, As people halfe amased, And thought in hym smale grace His foly so to face. Some iuged in this case Your penaunce toke no place, Your penaunce was to lyght; And thought, if ye had right, Ye shulde take further payne To resorte agayne To places where ye haue preched, And your lollardy lernyng teched, And there to make relacion In open predycacion, And knowlege your offence Before open audyence, Howe falsely ye had surmysed, And deuyllysshely deuysed The people to seduce, And chase them thorowe the muse Of your noughty counsell, To hunt them into hell, With blowyng out your hornes, Full of mockysshe scornes, With chatyng and rechatyng, And your busy pratyng: Of the gospell and the pystels Ye pyke out many thystels, And bremely with your bristels Ye cobble and ye clout Holy Scripture so about, That people are in great dout And feare leest they be out Of all good Christen order. Thus all thyng ye disorder Thorowe out euery bord[e]r. It had ben moche better Ye had neuer lerned letter, For your ignorance is gretter, I make you fast and sure, Than all your lytterature. Ye are but lydder logici, But moche worse isagogici, For ye haue enduced a secte With heresy all infecte; Wherfore ye are well checte, And by holy churche correcte, And in maner as abiecte, For euermore suspecte, And banysshed in effect From all honest company, Bycause ye haue eaten a flye, To your great vyllony, That neuer more may dye. Come forthe, ye popeholy, Full of melancoly; Your madde ipocrisy, And your idiosy, And your vayne glorie, Haue made you eate the flye, Pufte full of heresy, To preche it idolatry, Who so dothe magnifye That glorious mayde Mary; That glorious mayde and mother, So was there neuer another But that princesse alone, To whom we are bounde echone The ymage of her grace To reuerence in-euery place. I saye, ye braynlesse beestes, Why iangle you suche iestes, In your diuynite Of Luthers affynite, To the people of lay fee, Raylyng in your rages To worshyppe none ymages, Nor do pylgrymages? I saye, ye deuyllysshe pages, Full of suche dottages, Count ye your selfe good clerkes, And snapper in suche werkes? Saynt Gregorie and saynt Ambrose, Ye haue reed them, I suppose, Saynt Jerome and saynt Austen, With other many holy men, Saynt Thomas de Aquyno, With other doctours many mo, Whiche de latria do trete; They saye howe latria is an honour grete, Belongyng to the Deite: To this ye nedes must agre. But, I trowe, your selfe ye ouerse What longeth to Christes humanyte. If ye haue reed de hyperdulia, Than ye knowe what betokeneth dulia: Than shall ye fynde it fyrme and stable, And to our faithe moche agreable, To worshyppe ymages of sayntes. Wherfore make ye no mo restrayntes, But mende your myndes that are mased; Or els doutlesse ye shalbe blased, And be brent at a stake, If further busynesse that ye make. Therfore I vyse you to forsake Of heresy the deuyllysshe scoles, And crye Godmercy, lyke frantyke foles. Tantum pro secundo. Peroratio ad nuper abjuratos quosdam hypotheticos hæreticos, &amp;c.

Why fall ye at debate With Skelton laureate, Reputyng hym vnable To gainsay replycable Opinyons detestable Of heresy execrable? Ye saye that poetry Maye nat flye so hye In theology, Nor analogy, Nor philology, Nor philosophy, To answere or reply Agaynst suche heresy. Wherfore by and by Nowe consequently I call to this rekenyng Dauyd, that royall kyng, Whom Hieronymus, That doctour glorious, Dothe bothe write and call Poete of poetes all, And prophete princypall. This may nat be remorded, For it is wele recorded In his pystell ad Paulinum, Presbyterum divinum, Where worde for worde ye may Rede what Jerome there dothe say. David, inquit, Simonides noster, Pindarus, et Alcæus, Flaccus quoque, Catullus, atque Serenus, Christum lyra personat, et in decachordo psalterio ab inferis excitat resurgentem. Hæc Hier. The Englysshe. Kyng Dauid the prophete, of prophetes principall, Of poetes chefe poete, saint Jerome dothe wright, Resembled to Symonides, that poete lyricall Among the Grekes most relucent of lyght, In that faculte whiche shyned as Phebus bright; Lyke to Pyndarus in glorious poetry, Lyke vnto Alcheus, he dothe hym magnify. Flaccus nor Catullus with hym may nat compare, Nor solempne Serenus, for all his armony In metricall muses, his harpyng we may spare; For Dauid, our poete, harped so meloudiously Of our Sauyour Christ in his decacorde psautry, That at his resurrection he harped out of hell Olde patriarkes and prophetes in heuen with him to dwell. Returne we to our former processe. Than, if this noble kyng Thus can harpe and syng With his harpe of prophecy And spyrituall poetry, As saynt Jerome saythe, To whom we must gyue faythe, Warblyng with his strynges Of suche theologicall thynges, Why haue ye than disdayne At poetes, and complayne Howe poetes do but fayne? Ye do moche great outrage, For to disparage And to discorage The fame matryculate Of poetes laureate. For if ye sadly loke, And wesely rede the Boke Of Good Aduertysement, With me ye must consent And infallibly agre Of necessyte, Howe there is a spyrituall, And a mysteriall, And a mysticall Effecte energiall, As Grekes do it call, Of suche an industry, And suche a pregnacy, Of heuenly inspyracion In laureate creacyon, Of poetes commendacion, That of diuyne myseracion God maketh his habytacion In poetes whiche excelles, And soiourns with them and dwelles. By whose inflammacion Of spyrituall instygacion And diuyne inspyracion, We are kyndled in suche facyon With hete of the Holy Gost, Which is God of myghtes most, That he our penne dothe lede, And maketh in vs suche spede, That forthwith we must nede With penne and ynke procede, Somtyme for affection, Somtyme for sadde dyrection, Somtyme for correction, Somtyme vnder protection Of pacient sufferance, With sobre cyrcumstance, Our myndes to auaunce To no mannes anoyance; Therfore no greuance, I pray you, for to take, In this that I do make Agaynst these frenetykes, Agaynst these lunatykes, Agaynst these sysmatykes, Agaynst these heretykes, Nowe of late abiured, Most vnhappely vred: For be ye wele assured, That frensy nor ielousy Nor heresy wyll neuer dye.

Lyb. Ye, syr, passyng well: But, and you wolde me permyt To shewe parte of my wyt, Somwhat I coulde enferre, Your consayte to debarre, Vnder supportacyon Of pacyent tolleracyon Fel. God forbyd ye sholde be let Your reasons forth to fet; Wherfore at lyberte Say what ye wyll to me. Lyb. Brefly to touche of my purpose the effecte; Lyberte is laudable and pryuylegyd from lawe, Judycyall rygoure shall not me correcte— Fel. Softe, my frende; herein your reason is but rawe. Lyb. Yet suffer me to say the surpluse of my sawe; What wote ye where vpon I wyll conclude? I say, there is no welthe where as lyberte is subdude; I trowe ye can not say nay moche to this; To lyue vnder lawe, it is captyuyte; Where drede ledyth the daunce, there is no ioy nor blysse; Or howe can you proue that there is felycyte, And you haue not your owne fre lyberte To sporte at your pleasure, to ryn and to ryde? Where lyberte is absent, set welthe asyde. Hic intrat Measure. Meas. Cryst you assyste in your altrycacyon! Fel. Why, haue you harde of our dysputacyon? Meas. I parceyue well howe eche of you doth reason. Lyb. Mayster Measure, you be come in good season. Meas. And it is wonder that your wylde insolence Can be content with Measure presence. Fel. Wolde it please you then— Lyb. Vs to informe and ken— Meas. A, ye be wonders men! Your langage is lyke the penne Of hym that wryteth to fast. Fel. Syr, yf any worde haue past Me other fyrst or last, To you I arecte it, and cast Therof the reformacyon. Lyb. And I of the same facyon; Howe be it, by protestacyon, Dyspleasure that you none take, Some reason we must make. Meas. That wyll not I forsake, So it in measure be: Come of, therfore, let se; Shall I begynne or ye? Fel. Nay, ye shall begynne, by my wyll. Lyb. It is reason and skyll, We your pleasure fulfyll. Meas. Then ye must bothe consent You to holde content With myne argument; And I muste you requyre Me pacyently to here. Fel. Yes, syr, with ryght good chere. Lyb. With all my herte intere. Meas. Oracius to recorde, in his volumys olde, With euery condycyon measure must be sought: Welthe without measure wolde bere hymselfe to bolde, Lyberte without measure proue a thynge of nought; I ponder by nomber, by measure all thynge is wrought, As at the fyrst orygynall by godly opynyon, Whych prouyth well that measure shold haue domynyon: Where measure is mayster, plenty dothe none offence; Where measure lackyth, all thynge dysorderyd is; Where measure is absent, ryot kepeth resydence; Where measure is ruler, there is nothynge amysse; Measure is treasure: howe say ye, is it not this? Fel. Yes, questyonlesse, in myne opynyon, Measure is worthy to haue domynyon. Lyb. Vnto that same I am ryght well agrede, So that lyberte be not lefte behynde. Meas. Ye, lyberte with measure nede neuer drede. Lyb. What, lyberte to measure then wolde ye bynde? Meas. What ellys? for otherwyse it were agaynst kynde: If lyberte sholde lepe and renne where he lyst, It were no vertue, it were a thynge vnblyst; It were a myschefe, yf lyberte lacked a reyne, Where with to rule hym with the wrythyng of a rest: All trebyllys and tenours be rulyd by a meyne; Lyberte without measure is acountyd for a beste; There is no surfet where measure rulyth the feste; There is no excesse where measure hath his helthe; Measure contynwyth prosperyte and welthe. Fel. Vnto your rule I wyll annex my mynde. Lyb. So wolde I, but I wolde be lothe, That wonte was to be formyst, now to come behynde: It were a shame, to God I make an othe, Without I myght cut it out of the brode clothe, As I was wonte euer at my fre wyll. Meas. But haue ye not herde say, that wyll is no skyll? Take sad dyreccyon, and leue this wantonnesse. Lyb. It is no maystery. Fel. Tushe, let Measure procede, And after his mynde herdely your selfe adresse; For, without measure, pouerte and nede Wyll crepe vpon vs, and vs to myschefe lede; For myschefe wyll mayster vs, yf measure vs forsake. Lyb. Well, I am content your wayes to take. Meas. Surely, I am ioyous that ye be myndyd thus. Magnyfycence to mayntayne, your promosyon shalbe. Fel. So in his harte he may be glad of vs. Lyb. There is no prynce but he hath nede of vs thre, Welthe, with Measure and plesaunt Lyberte. Meas. Nowe pleasyth you a lytell whyle to stande; Me semeth Magnyfycence is comynge here at hande. Hic intrat Magnyfycence. Magn. To assure you of my noble porte and fame, Who lyst to knowe, Magnyfycence I hyght. But, Measure my frende, what hyght this mannys name? Meas. Syr, though ye be a noble prynce of myght, Yet in this man you must set your delyght; And, syr, this other mannys name is Lyberte. Magn. Welcome, frendys, ye are bothe vnto me: But nowe let me knowe of your conuersacyon. Fel. Pleasyth your grace, Felycyte they me call. Lyb. And I am Lyberte, made of in euery nacyon. Magn. Conuenyent persons for any prynce ryall. Welthe with Lyberte, with me bothe dwell ye shall, To the gydynge of my Measure you bothe commyttynge: That Measure be mayster, vs semeth it is syttynge. Meas. Where as ye haue, syr, to me them assygned, Suche order, I trust, with them for to take, So that welthe with measure shalbe conbyned, And lyberte his large with measure shall make. Fel. Your ordenaunce, syr, I wyll not forsake. Lyb. And I my selfe hooly to you wyll inclyne. Magn. Then may I say that ye be seruauntys myne, For by measure, I warne you, we thynke to be gydyd; Wherin it is necessary my pleasure you knowe, Measure and I wyll neuer be deuydyd For no dyscorde that any man can sawe; For measure is a meane, nother to hy nor to lawe, In whose attemperaunce I haue suche delyght, That measure shall neuer departe from my syght. Fel. Laudable your consayte is to be acountyd; For welthe without measure sodenly wyll slyde. Lyb. As your grace full nobly hath recountyd, Measure with noblenesse sholde be alyde. Magn. Then, Lyberte, se that Measure be your gyde, For I wyll vse you by his aduertysment. Fel. Then shall you haue with you prosperyte resydent. Meas. I trowe, good fortune hath annexyd vs together, To se howe greable we are of one mynde; There is no flaterer, nor losyll so lyther, This lynkyd chayne of loue that can vnbynde. Nowe that ye haue me chefe ruler assyngned, I wyll endeuour me to order euery thynge Your noblenesse and honour consernynge. Lyb. In ioy and myrthe your mynde shalbe inlargyd, And not embracyd with pusyllanymyte; But plenarly all thought from you must be dyschargyd, If ye lyst to lyue after your fre lyberte: All delectacyons aquayntyd is with me, By me all persons worke what they lyste. Meas. Hem, syr, yet beware of Had I wyste! Lyberte in some cause becomyth a gentyll mynde, Bycause course of measure, yf I be in the way: Who countyth without me, is caste to fer behynde Of his rekenynge, as euydently we may Se at our eye the worlde day by day; For defaute of measure all thynge dothe excede. Fel. All that ye say is as trewe as the Crede; For howe be it lyberte to welthe is conuenyent, And from felycyte may not be forborne, Yet measure hath ben so longe from vs absent, That all men laugh at lyberte to scorne; Welth and wyt, I say, be so threde bare worne, That all is without measure, and fer beyonde the mone. Magn. Then noblenesse, I se well, is almoste vndone, But yf therof the soner amendys be made; For dowtlesse I parceyue my magnyfycence Without measure lyghtly may fade, Of to moche lyberte vnder the offence: Wherfore, Measure, take Lyberte with you hence, And rule hym after the rule of your scole. Lyb. What, syr, wolde ye make me a poppynge fole? Meas. Why, were not your selfe agreed to the same, And now wolde ye swarue from your owne ordynaunce? Lyb. I wolde be rulyd, and I myght for shame. Fel. A, ye make me laughe at your inconstaunce. Magn. Syr, without any longer delyaunce, Take Lyberte to rule, and folowe myne entent. Meas. It shalbe done at your commaundement. Itaque Measure exeat locum cum Libertate, et maneat Magnyfycence cum Felicitate. Magn. It is a wanton thynge this Lyberte; Perceyue you not howe lothe he was to abyde The rule of Measure, notwithstandynge we Haue deputyd Measure hym to gyde? By measure eche thynge duly is tryde: Thynke you not thus, my frende Felycyte? Fel. God forbede that it other wyse sholde be! Magn. Ye coulde not ellys, I wote, with me endure. Fel. Endure? no, God wote, it were great payne; But yf I were orderyd by iust measure, It were not possyble me longe to retayne. Hic intrat Fansy. Fan. Tusche, holde your pece, your langage is vayne. Please it your grace to take no dysdayne, To shewe you playnly the trouth as I thynke. Magn. Here is none forsyth whether you flete or synke. Fel. From whens come you, syr, that no man lokyd after? Magn. Or who made you so bolde to interrupe my tale? Fan. Nowe, benedicite, ye wene I were some hafter, Or ellys some iangelynge Jacke of the vale; Ye wene that I am dronken, bycause I loke pale. Magn. Me semeth that ye haue dronken more than ye haue bled. Fan. Yet amonge noble men I was brought vp and bred. Fel. Nowe leue this iangelynge, and to vs expounde Why that ye sayd our langage was in vayne. Fan. Mary, vpon trouth my reason I grounde, That without largesse noblenesse can not rayne; And that I sayd ones, yet I say agayne, I say without largesse worshyp hath no place, For largesse is a purchaser of pardon and of grace. Magn. Nowe, I beseche thé, tell me what is thy name? Fan. Largesse, that all lordes sholde loue, syr, I hyght. Fel. But hyght you, Largesse, encreace of noble fame? Fan. Ye, syr, vndoubted. Fel. Then, of very ryght, With Magnyfycence, this noble prynce of myght, Sholde be your dwellynge, in my consyderacyon. Magn. Yet we wyll therin take good delyberacyon. Fan. As in that, I wyll not be agaynst your pleasure. Fel. Syr, hardely remembre what may your name auaunce. Magn. Largesse is laudable, so it be in measure. Fan. Largesse is he that all prynces doth auaunce; I reporte me herein to Kynge Lewes of Fraunce. Fel. Why haue ye hym named, and all other refused? Fan. For, syth he dyed, largesse was lytell vsed. Plucke vp your mynde, syr; what ayle you to muse? Haue ye not welthe here at your wyll? It is but a maddynge, these wayes that ye vse: What auayleth lordshyp, yourselfe for to kyll With care and with thought howe Jacke shall haue Gyl? Magn. What? I haue aspyed ye are a carles page. Fan. By God, syr, ye se but fewe wyse men of myne age; But couetyse hath blowen you so full of wynde, That colica passio hath gropyd you by the guttys. Fel. In fayth, broder Largesse, you haue a mery mynde. Fan. In fayth, I set not by the worlde two Dauncaster cuttys. Magn. Ye wante but a wylde flyeng bolte to shote at the buttes: Though Largesse ye hyght, your langage is to large; For whiche ende goth forwarde ye take lytell charge. Fel. Let se, this checke yf ye voyde canne. Fan. In faythe, els had I gone to longe to scole, But yf I coulde knowe a gose from a swanne. Magn. Wel, wyse men may ete the fysshe, when ye shal draw the pole. Fan. In fayth, I wyll not say that ye shall proue a fole, But ofte tymes haue I sene wyse men do mad dedys. Magn. Go, shake the dogge, hay, syth ye wyll nedys! You are nothynge mete with vs for to dwell, That with your lorde and mayster so pertly can prate: Gete you hens, I say, by my counsell; I wyll not vse you to play with me checke mate. Fan. Syr, yf I haue offended your noble estate, I trow I haue brought you suche wrytynge of recorde, That I shall haue you agayne my good lorde: To you recommendeth Sad Cyrcumspeccyon, And sendeth you this wrytynge closed vnder sele. Magn. This wrytynge is welcome with harty affeccyon: Why kepte you it thus longe? howe dothe he? wele? Fan. Syr, thanked be God, he hath his hele. Magn. Welthe, gete you home, and commaunde me to Mesure; Byd hym take good hede to you, my synguler tresure. Fel. Is there ony thynge elles your grace wyll commaunde me? Magn. Nothynge but fare you well tyll sone; And that he take good kepe to Lyberte. Fel. Your pleasure, syr, shortely shall be done. Magn. I shall come to you myselfe, I trowe, this afternone. I pray you, Larges, here to remayne, Whylest, I knowe what this letter dothe contayne. Hic faciat tanquam legeret litteras tacite. Interim superveniat cantando Counterfet, Counternaunce suspenso gradu, qui, viso Magnyfycence, sensim retrocedat; at tempus postpusillum rursum accedat Counterfet Countenaunce prospectando et vocitando a longe; et Fansy animat silentium cum manu. C. Count. What, Fansy, Fansy! Magn. Who is that that thus dyd cry? Me thought he called Fansy. Fan. It was a Flemynge hyght Hansy. Magn. Me thought he called Fansy me behynde. Fan. Nay, syr, it was nothynge but your mynde: But nowe, syr, as touchynge this letter— Magn. I shall loke in it at leasure better: And surely ye are to hym beholde; And for his sake ryght gladly I wolde Do what I coude to do you good. Fan. I pray, God kepe you in that mood! Magn. This letter was wryten ferre hence. Fan. By lakyn, syr, it hathe cost me pence And grotes many one, or I came to your presence. Magn. Where was it delyuered you, shewe vnto me. Fan. By God, syr, beyonde the se. Magn. At what place nowe, as you gesse? Fan. By my trouthe, syr, at Pountesse; This wrytynge was taken me there, But neuer was I in gretter fere. Magn. Howe so? Fan. By God, at the see syde, Had I not opened my purse wyde, I trowe, by our lady, I had ben slayne, Or elles I had lost myne eres twayne. Magn. By your soth? Fan. Ye, and there is suche a wache, That no man can scape but they hym cache. They bare me in hande that I was a spye; And another bade put out myne eye, Another wolde myne eye were blerde, Another bade shaue halfe my berde; And boyes to the pylery gan me plucke, And wolde haue made me Freer Tucke, To preche out of the pylery hole, Without an antetyme or a stole; And some bade sere hym with a marke: To gete me fro them I had moche warke. Magn. Mary, syr, ye were afrayde. Fan. By my trouthe, had I not payde and prayde, And made largesse as I hyght, I had not ben here with you this nyght; But surely largesse saued my lyfe, For largesse stynteth all maner of stryfe. Magn. It dothe so sure nowe and than, But largesse is not mete for euery man. Fan. No, but for you grete estates: Largesse stynteth grete debates; And he that I came fro to this place Sayd I was mete for your grace; And in dede, syr, I here men talke, By the way as I ryde and walke, Say howe you excede in noblenesse, If you had with you largesse. Magn. And say they so in very dede? Fan. With ye, syr, so God me spede. Magn. Yet mesure is a mery mene. Fan. Ye, syr, a blannched almonde is no bene. Measure is mete for a marchauntes hall, But largesse becometh a state ryall. What, sholde you pynche at a pecke of otes, Ye wolde sone pynche at a pecke of grotes. Thus is the talkynge of one and of oder, As men dare speke it hugger mugger; A lorde a negarde, it is a shame, But largesse may amende your name. Magn. In faythe, Largesse, welcome to me. Fan. I pray you, syr, I may so be, And of my seruyce you shall not mysse. Magn. Togyder we wyll talke more of this: Let vs departe from hens home to my place. Fan. I folow euen after your noble grace. Hic discedat Magnificens cum Fansy, et intrat Counterfet Countenaunce. C. Count. What, I say, herke a worde. Fan. Do away, I say, the deuylles torde! C. Count. Ye, but how longe shall I here awayte? Fan. By Goddys body, I come streyte: I hate this blunderyng that thou doste make. C. Count. Nowe to the deuyll I thé betake, For in fayth ye be well met. Fansy hath cachyd in a flye net This noble man Magnyfycence, Of Largesse vnder the pretence. They haue made me here to put the stone: But nowe wyll I, that they be gone, In bastarde ryme, after the dogrell gyse, Tell you where of my name dothe ryse. For Counterfet Countenaunce knowen am I; This worlde is full of my foly. I set not by hym a fly, That can not counterfet a lye, Swere, and stare, and byde therby, And countenaunce it clenly, And defende it manerly. A knaue wyll counterfet nowe a knyght, A lurdayne lyke a lorde to fyght, A mynstrell lyke a man of myght, A tappyster lyke a lady bryght: Thus make I them wyth thryft to fyght, Thus at the laste I brynge hym ryght To Tyburne, where they hange on hyght. To counterfet I can by praty wayes: Of nyghtys to occupy counterfet kayes, Clenly to counterfet newe arayes, Counterfet eyrnest by way of playes: Thus am I occupyed at all assayes; What so euer I do, all men me prayse, And mekyll am I made of nowe adays: Counterfet maters in the lawe of the lande, Wyth golde and grotes they grese my hande, In stede of ryght that wronge may stande, And counterfet fredome that is bounde; I counterfet suger that is but founde; Counterfet capytaynes by me are mande; Of all lewdnesse I kyndell the brande; Counterfet kyndnesse, and thynke dyscayte; Counterfet letters by the way of sleyght; Subtelly vsynge counterfet weyght; Counterfet langage, fayty bone geyte. Counterfetynge is a proper bayte; A counte to counterfet in a resayte; To counterfet well is a good consayte. Counterfet maydenhode may well be borne, But counterfet coynes is laughynge to scorne; It is euyll patchynge of that is torne; Whan the noppe is rughe, it wolde be shorne; Counterfet haltynge without a thorne; Yet counterfet chafer is but euyll corne; All thynge is worse whan it is worne. What, wolde ye, wyues, counterfet The courtly gyse of the newe iet? An olde barne wolde be vnderset: It is moche worthe that is ferre fet. What, wanton, wanton, nowe well ymet! What, Margery Mylke Ducke, mermoset! It wolde be masked in my net; It wolde be nyce, thoughe I say nay; By Crede, it wolde haue fresshe aray, And therfore shall my husbande pay; To counterfet she wyll assay All the newe gyse, fresshe and gaye, And be as praty as she may, And iet it ioly as a iay: Counterfet prechynge, and byleue the contrary; Counterfet conscyence, peuysshe pope holy; Counterfet sadnesse, with delynge full madly; Counterfet holynes is called ypocrysy; Counterfet reason is not worth a flye; Counterfet wysdome, and workes of foly; Counterfet countenaunce euery man dothe occupy Counterfet worshyp outwarde men may se; Ryches rydeth out, at home is pouerte; Counterfet pleasure is borne out by me: Coll wolde go clenly, and it wyll not be, And Annot wolde be nyce, and laughes, tehe wehe; Your counterfet countenaunce is all of nysyte, A plummed partrydge all redy to flye: A knokylbonyarde wyll counterfet a clarke, He wolde trotte gentylly, but he is to starke, At his cloked counterfetynge dogges dothe barke; A carter a courtyer, it is a worthy warke, That with his whyp his mares was wonte to yarke; A custrell to dryue the deuyll out of the derke, A counterfet courtyer with a knaues marke. To counterfet this freers haue lerned me; This nonnes nowe and then, and it myght be, Wolde take in the way of counterfet charyte The grace of God vnder benedicite; To counterfet thyr counsell they gyue me a fee; Chanons can not counterfet but vpon thre, Monkys may not for drede that men sholde them se. Hic ingrediatur Fansy properanter cum Crafty Conueyaunce, cum famine multo adinvicem garrulantes: tandem, viso Counterfet Countenaunce, dicat Crafty Conueyaunce. Cr. Con. What, Counterfet Countenaunce! C. Count. What, Crafty Conueyaunce! Fan. What, the deuyll, are ye two of aquayntaunce? God gyue you a very myschaunce! Cr. Con. Yes, yes, syr, he and I haue met. C. Count. We haue bene togyder bothe erly and late: But, Fansy my frende, where haue ye bene so longe? Fan. By God, I haue bene about a praty pronge; Crafty Conueyaunce, I sholde say, and I. Cr. Con. By God, we haue made Magnyfycence to ete a flye. C. Count. Howe coulde ye do that, and [I] was away? Fan. By God, man, bothe his pagent and thyne he can play. C. Count. Say trouth? Cr. Con. Yes, yes, by lakyn, I shall thé warent, As longe as I lyue, thou haste an heyre parent. Fan. Yet haue we pyckyd out a rome for thé. C. Count. Why, shall we dwell togyder all thre? Cr. Con. Why, man, it were to great a wonder, That we thre galauntes sholde be longe asonder. C. Count. For Cockys harte, gyue me thy hande. Fan. By the masse, for ye are able to dystroy an hole lande. Cr. Con. By God, yet it muste begynne moche of thé. Fan. Who that is ruled by vs, it shalbe longe or he thee. C. Count. But, I say, kepest thou the olde name styll that thou had? Cr. Con. Why, wenyst thou, horson, that I were so mad? Fan. Nay, nay, he hath chaunged his, and I haue chaunged myne. C. Count. Nowe, what is his name, and what is thyne? Fan. In faythe, Largesse I hyght, And I am made a knyght. C. Count. A rebellyon agaynst nature, So large a man, and so lytell of stature! But, syr, howe counterfetyd ye? Cr. Con. Sure Surueyaunce I named me. C. Count. Surueyaunce! where ye suruey, Thryfte hathe lost her cofer kay. Fan. But is it not well? howe thynkest thou? C. Count. Yes, syr, I gyue God auowe, Myselfe coude not counterfet it better. But what became of the letter, That I counterfeyted you vnderneath a shrowde? Fan. By the masse, odly well alowde. Cr. Con. By God, had not I it conuayed, Yet Fansy had ben dysceyued. C. Count. I wote, thou arte false ynoughe for one. Fan. By my trouthe, we had ben gone: And yet, in fayth, man, we lacked thé For to speke with Lyberte. C. Count. What is Largesse without Lyberte? Cr. Con. By Mesure mastered yet is he. C. Count. What, is your conueyaunce no better? Fan. In faythe, Mesure is lyke a tetter, That ouergroweth a mannes face, So he ruleth ouer all our place. Cr. Con. Nowe therfore, whylest we are togyder,— Counterfet Countenaunce, nay, come hyder,— I say, whylest we are togyder in same— C. Count. Tushe, a strawe, it is a shame That we can no better than so. Fan. We wyll remedy it, man, or we go; For, lyke as mustarde is sharpe of taste, Ryght so a sharpe fansy must be founde Wherwith Mesure to confounde. Cr. Con. Can you a remedy for a tysyke, That sheweth yourselfe thus spedde in physyke? C. Count. It is a gentyll reason of a rake. Fan. For all these iapes yet that ye make— Cr. Con. Your fansy maketh myne elbowe to ake. Fan. Let se, fynde you a better way. C. Count. Take no dyspleasure of that we say. Cr. Con. Nay, and you be angry and ouerwharte, A man may beshrowe your angry harte. Fan. Tushe, a strawe, I thought none yll. C. Count. What, shall we iangle thus all the day styll? Cr. Con. Nay, let vs our heddes togyder cast. Fan. Ye, and se howe it may be compast, That Mesure were cast out of the dores. C. Count. Alasse, where is my botes and my spores? Cr. Con. In all this hast whether wyll ye ryde? C. Count. I trowe, it shall not nede to abyde. Cockes woundes, se, syrs, se, se! Hic ingrediatur Cloked Colusyon cum elato aspectu, deorsum et sursum ambulando. Fan. Cockes armes, what is he? Cr. Con. By Cockes harte, he loketh hye; He hawketh, me thynke, for a butterflye. C. Count. Nowe, by Cockes harte, well abyden, For, had you not come, I had ryden. Cl. Col. Thy wordes be but wynde, neuer they haue no wayght; Thou hast made me play the iurde hayte. C. Count. And yf ye knewe howe I haue mused, I am sure ye wolde haue me excused. Cl. Col. I say, come hyder: what are these twayne? C. Count. By God, syr, this is Fansy small brayne; And Crafty Conuayaunce, knowe you not hym? Cl. Col. Know hym, syr! quod he; yes, by Saynt Sym. Here is a leysshe of ratches to renne an hare: Woo is that purse that ye shall share! Fan. What call ye him, this? Cr. Con. I trowe, that he is. C. Count. Tushe, holde your pece. Se you not how they prece For to knowe your name? Cl. Col. Knowe they not me, they are to blame. Knowe you not me, syrs? Fan. No, in dede. Cr. Con. Abyde, lette me se, take better hede; Cockes harte, it is Cloked Colusyon. Cl. Col. A, syr, I pray God gyue you confusyon! Fan. Cockes armes, is that your name? C. Count. Ye, by the masse, this is euen the same, That all this matter must vnder grope. Cr. Con. What is this he wereth, a cope? Cl. Col. Cappe, syr; I say you be to bolde. Fan. Se, howe he is wrapped for the colde: Is it not a vestment? Cl. Col. A, ye wante a rope. C. Count. Tushe, it is Syr Johnn Double cloke. Fan. Syr, and yf ye wolde not be wrothe— Cl. Col. What sayst? Fan. Here was to lytell clothe. Cl. Col. A, Fansy, Fansy, God sende thé brayne! Fan. Ye, for your wyt is cloked for the rayne. Cr. Con. Nay, lette vs not clatter thus styll. Cl. Col. Tell me, syrs, what is your wyll. C. Count. Syr, it is so that these twayne With Magnyfycence in housholde do remayne; And there they wolde haue me to dwell, But I wyll be ruled after your counsell. Fan. Mary, so wyll we also. Cl. Col. But tell me where aboute ye go. C. Count. By God, we wolde gete vs all thyder, Spell the remenaunt, and do togyder. Cl. Col. Hath Magnyfycence ony tresure? Cr. Con. Ye, but he spendeth it all in mesure. Cl. Col. Why, dwelleth Mesure where ye two dwell? In faythe, he were better to dwell in hell. Fan. Yet where we wonne, nowe there wonneth he. Cl. Col. And haue you not amonge you Lyberte? C. Count. Ye, but he is a captyuyte. Cl. Col. What, the deuyll, howe may that be? C. Count. I can not tell you: why aske you me? Aske these two that there dothe dwell. Cl. Col. Syr, the playnesse you tell me. Cr. Con. There dwelleth a mayster men calleth Mesure— Fan. Ye, and he hath rule of all his tresure. Cr. Con.

Fansy and I, we twayne, With Magnyfycence in housholde do remayne, And counterfeted our names we haue Craftely all thynges vpryght to saue, His name Largesse, Surueyaunce myne: Magnyfycence to vs begynneth to enclyne Counterfet Countenaunce to haue also, And wolde that we sholde for hym go. C. Count. But shall I haue myne olde name styll? Cr. Con. Pease, I haue not yet sayd what I wyll. Fan. Here is a pystell of a postyke! Cl. Col. Tusshe, fonnysshe Fansy, thou arte frantyke. Tell on, syr, howe then? Cr. Con. Mary, syr, he tolde vs, when We had hym founde, we sholde hym brynge, And that we fayled not for nothynge. Cl. Col. All this ye may easely brynge aboute. Fan. Mary, the better and Mesure were out. Cl. Col. Why, can ye not put out that foule freke? Cr. Con. No, in euery corner he wyll peke, So that we haue no lyberte, Nor no man in courte but he, For Lyberte he hath in gydyng. C. Count. In fayth, and without Lyberte there is no bydyng. Fan. In fayth, and Lybertyes rome is there but small. Cl. Col. Hem! that lyke I nothynge at all. Cr. Con. But, Counterfet Countenaunce, go we togyder, All thre, I say. C. Count. Shall I go? whyder? Cr.

Cl. Col. By Cockys body, here begynneth the game! For then shall we so craftely cary, That Mesure shall not there longe tary. Fan. For Cockys harte, tary whylyst that I come agayne. Cr. Con.

To passe the tyme and order whyle a man may talke Of one thynge and other to occupy the place; Then for the season that I here shall walke, As good to be occupyed as vp and downe to trace And do nothynge; how be it full lytell grace There cometh and groweth of my comynge, For Clokyd Colusyon is a perylous thynge. Double delynge and I be all one; Craftynge and haftynge contryued is by me; I can dyssemble, I can bothe laughe and grone; Playne delynge and I can neuer agre; But dyuysyon, dyssencyon, dyrysyon, these thre And I am counterfet of one mynde and thought, By the menys of myschyef to bryng all thynges to nought. And though I be so odyous a geste, And euery man gladly my company wolde refuse, In faythe yet am I occupyed with the best; Full fewe that can themselfe of me excuse. Whan other men laughe, than study I and muse, Deuysynge the meanes and wayes that I can, Howe I may hurte and hynder euery man: Two faces in a hode couertly I bere, Water in the one hande, and fyre in the other; I can fede forth a fole, and lede hym by the eyre; Falshode in felowshyp is my sworne brother. By cloked colusyon, I say, and none other, Comberaunce and trouble in Englande fyrst I began; From that lorde to that lorde I rode and I ran, And flatered them with fables fayre before theyr face, And tolde all the myschyef I coude behynde theyr backe, And made as I had knowen nothynge of the case; I wolde begyn all myschyef, but I wolde bere no lacke: Thus can I lerne you, syrs, to bere the deuyls sacke; And yet, I trowe, some of you be better sped than I Frendshyp to fayne, and thynke full lytherly. Paynte to a purpose good countenaunce I can, And craftely can I grope howe euery man is mynded; My purpose is to spy and to poynte euery man; My tonge is with fauell forked and tyned: By Cloked Colusyon thus many one is begyled. Eche man to hynder I gape and I gaspe; My speche is all pleasure, but I stynge lyke a waspe: I am neuer glad but whan I may do yll, And neuer am I sory but whan that I se I can not myne apyetyte accomplysshe and fulfyll In hynderaunce of welthe and prosperyte; I laughe at all shrewdenes, and lye at lyberte. I muster, I medle; amonge these grete estates I sowe sedycyous sedes of dyscorde and debates: To flater and to flery is all my pretence Amonge all suche persones as I well vnderstonde Be lyght of byleue and hasty of credence; I make them to startyll and sparkyll lyke a bronde, I moue them, I mase them, I make them so fonde, That they wyll here no man but the fyrst tale: And so by these meanes I brewe moche bale.

The deuyll spede whyt! That was before, I set behynde; Nowe to curteys, forthwith vnkynde; Somtyme to sober, somtyme to sadde, Somtyme to mery, somtyme to madde; Somtyme I syt as I were solempe prowde; Somtyme I laughe ouer lowde; Somtyme I wepe for a gew gaw; Somtyme I laughe at waggynge of a straw; With a pere my loue you may wynne, And ye may lese it for a pynne. I haue a thynge for to say, And I may tende therto for play; But in faythe I am so occupyed On this halfe and on euery syde, That I wote not where I may rest. Fyrst to tell you what were best, Frantyke Fansy-seruyce I hyght; My wyttys be weke, my braynys are lyght: For it is I that other whyle Plucke downe lede, and theke with tyle; Nowe I wyll this, and nowe I wyll that; Make a wyndmyll of a mat; Nowe I wolde, and I wyst what; Where is my cappe? I haue lost my hat; And within an houre after, Plucke downe an house, and set vp a rafter; Hyder and thyder, I wote not whyder; Do and vndo, bothe togyder; Of a spyndell I wyll make a sparre; All that I make, forthwith I marre; I blunder, I bluster, I blowe, and I blother; I make on the one day, and I marre on the other; Bysy, bysy, and euer bysy, I daunce vp and downe tyll I am dyssy; I can fynde fantasyes where none is; I wyll not haue it so, I wyll haue it this.

Fyrst I lay before them my bybyll, And teche them howe they sholde syt ydyll, To pyke theyr fyngers all the day longe; So in theyr eyre I synge them a songe, And make them so longe to muse, That some of them renneth strayght to the stuse; To thefte and bryboury I make some fall, And pyke a locke and clyme a wall; And where I spy a nysot gay, That wyll syt ydyll all the day, And can not set herselfe to warke, I kyndell in her suche a lyther sparke, That rubbed she must be on the gall Bytwene the tappet and the wall. Cr. Con. What, horson, arte thou such a one? Fan. Nay, beyonde all other set hym alone. Cr. Con. Hast thou ony more? let se, procede. Fol. Ye, by God, syr, for a nede, I haue another maner of sorte, That I laugh at for my dysporte; And those be they that come vp of nought, As some be not ferre, and yf it were well sought: Suche dawys, what soeuer they be, That be set in auctorite, Anone he waxyth so hy and prowde, He frownyth fyersly, brymly browde, The knaue wolde make it koy, and he cowde; All that he dothe, muste be alowde; And, This is not well done, syr, take hede; And maketh hym besy where is no nede: He dawnsys so longe, hey, troly loly, That euery man lawghyth at his foly. Cr. Con. By the good Lorde, truthe he sayth. Fan. Thynkyst thou not so, by thy fayth? Cr. Con. Thynke I not so, quod he! ellys haue I shame, For I knowe dyuerse that vseth the same. Fol. But nowe, forsothe, man, it maketh no mater; For they that wyll so bysely smater, So helpe me God, man, euer at the length I make hym lese moche of theyr strength; For with foly so do I them lede, That wyt he wantyth when he hath moste nede. Fan. Forsothe, tell on: hast thou any mo? Fol. Yes, I shall tell you, or I go, Of dyuerse mo that hauntyth my scolys. Cr. Con. All men beware of suche folys! Fol. There be two lyther, rude and ranke, Symkyn Tytyuell and Pers Pykthanke; Theys lythers I lerne them for to lere What he sayth and she sayth to lay good ere, And tell to his sufferayne euery whyt, And then he is moche made of for his wyt; And, be the mater yll more or lesse, He wyll make it mykyll worse than it is: But all that he dothe, and yf he reken well, It is but foly euery dell. Fan. Are not his wordys cursydly cowchyd? Cr. Con. By God, there be some that be shroudly towchyd: But, I say, let se and yf thou haue any more. Fol. I haue an hole armory of suche haburdashe in store; For there be other that foly dothe vse, That folowe fonde fantasyes and vertu refuse. Fan. Nay, that is my parte that thou spekest of nowe. Fol. So is all the remenaunt, I make God auowe; For thou fourmest suche fantasyes in theyr mynde, That euery man almost groweth out of kynde. Cr. Con. By the masse, I am glad that I came hyder, To here you two rutters dyspute togyder. Fan. Nay, but Fansy must be eyther fyrst or last. Fol. But whan Foly cometh, all is past. Fan. I wote not whether it cometh of thé or of me, But all is foly that I can se. Cr. Con. Mary, syr, ye may swere it on a boke. Fol. Ye, tourne ouer the lefe, rede there and loke, Howe frantyke Fansy fyrst of all Maketh man and woman in foly to fall. Cr. Con. A, syr, a, a! howe by that! Fan. A peryllous thynge, to cast a cat Vpon a naked man, and yf she scrat. Fol. So how, I say, the hare is squat! For, frantyke Fansy, thou makest men madde; And I, Foly, bryngeth them to qui fuit gadde, With qui fuit brayne seke I haue them brought From qui fuit aliquid to shyre shakynge nought. Cr. Con. Well argued and surely on bothe sydes: But for thé, Fansy, Magnyfycence abydes. Fan. Why, shall I not haue Foly with me also? Cr. Con. Yes, perde, man, whether that ye ryde or go: Yet for his name we must fynde a slyght. Fan. By the masse, he shall hyght Consayte. Cr. Con. Not a better name vnder the sonne: With Magnyfycence thou shalte wonne. Fol. God haue mercy, good godfather. Cr. Con. Yet I wolde that ye had gone rather; For, as sone as you come in Magnyfycence syght, All mesure and good rule is gone quyte. Fan. And shall we haue lyberte to do what we wyll? Cr. Con. Ryot at lyberte russheth it out styll. Fol. Ye, but tell me one thynge. Cr. Con. What is that? Fol. Who is mayster of the masshe fat? Fan. Ye, for he hathe a full dry soule. Cr. Con. Cockes armes, thou shalte kepe the brewhouse boule. Fol. But may I drynke therof whylest that I stare? Cr. Con. When mesure is gone, what nedest thou spare? Whan mesure is gone, we may slee care. Fol. Nowe then goo we hens, away the mare! Crafty Conueyaunce alone in the place. Cr. Con. It is wonder to se the worlde aboute, To se what foly is vsed in euery place; Foly hath a rome, I say, in euery route, To put, where he lyst, Foly hath fre chace; Foly and Fansy all where, euery man dothe face and brace; Foly fotyth it properly, Fansy ledyth the dawnce; And next come I after, Crafty Conueyaunce. Who so to me gyueth good aduertence, Shall se many thyngys donne craftely: By me conueyed is wanton insolence, Pryuy poyntmentys conueyed so properly, For many tymes moche kyndnesse is denyed For drede that we dare not ofte lest we be spyed; By me is conueyed mykyll praty ware, Somtyme, I say, behynde the dore for nede; I haue an hoby can make larkys to dare; I knyt togyther many a broken threde. It is great almesse the hungre to fede, To clothe the nakyd where is lackynge a smocke, Trymme at her tayle, or a man can turne a socke: What howe, be ye mery! was it not well conueyed? As oft as ye lyst, so honeste be sauyd; Alas, dere harte, loke that we be not perseyuyd! Without crafte nothynge is well behauyd; Though I shewe you curtesy, say not that I craue, Yet conuey it craftely, and hardely spare not for me, So that there knowe no man but I and she. Thefte also and pety brybery Without me be full oft aspyed; My inwyt delynge there can no man dyscry, Conuey it be crafte, lyft and lay asyde: Full moche flatery and falsehode I hyde, And by crafty conueyaunce I wyll, and I can, Saue a stronge thefe and hange a trew man. But some man wolde conuey, and can not skyll, As malypert tauernars that checke with theyr betters, Theyr conueyaunce weltyth the worke all by wyll; And some wyll take vpon them to conterfet letters, And therwithall conuey hymselfe into a payre of fetters; And some wyll conuey by the pretence of sadnesse, Tyll all theyr conueyaunce is turnyd into madnesse. Crafty conueyaunce is no chyldlys game: By crafty conueyaunce many one is brought vp of nought; Crafty Conueyaunce can cloke hymselfe frome shame, For by crafty conueyaunce wonderful thynges are wrought: By conuayaunce crafty I haue brought Vnto Magnyfyce[nce] a full vngracyous sorte, For all hokes vnhappy to me haue resorte. Here cometh in Magnyfycence with Lyberte and Felycyte. Magn. Trust me, Lyberte, it greueth me ryght sore To se you thus ruled and stande in suche awe. Lyb. Syr, as by my wyll, it shall be so no more. Fel. Yet lyberte without rule is not worth a strawe. Magn. Tushe, holde your peas, ye speke lyke a dawe; Ye shall be occupyed, Welthe, at my wyll. Cr. Con. All that ye say, syr, is reason and skyll. Magn. Mayster Suruayour, where haue ye ben so longe? Remembre ye not how my lyberte by mesure ruled was? Cr. Con. In good faythe, syr, me semeth he had the more wronge. Lyb. Mary, syr, so dyd he excede and passe, They droue me to lernynge lyke a dull asse. Fel. It is good yet that lyberte be ruled by reason. Magn. Tushe, holde your peas, ye speke out of season: Yourselfe shall be ruled by lyberte and largesse. Fel. I am content, so it in measure be. Lyb. Must mesure, in the mares name, you furnysshe and dresse? Magn. Nay, nay, not so, my frende Felycyte. Cr. Con. Not, and your grace wolde be ruled by me. Lyb. Nay, he shall be ruled euen as I lyst. Fel. Yet it is good to beware of Had I wyst. Magn. Syr, by lyberte and largesse I wyll that ye shall Be gouerned and gyded: wote ye what I say? Mayster Suruayour, Largesse to me call. Cr. Con. It shall be done. Magn. Ye, but byd hym come away At ones, and let hym not tary all day. Here goth out Crafty Conuayaunce. Fel. Yet it is good wysdome to worke wysely by welth. Lyb. Holde thy tonge, and thou loue thy helth. Magn. What, wyll ye waste wynde, and prate thus in vayne? Ye haue eten sauce, I trowe, at the Taylers Hall. Lyb. Be not to bolde, my frende; I counsell you, bere a brayne. Magn. And what so we say, holde you content withall. Fel. Syr, yet without sapyence your substaunce may be smal; For, where is no mesure, howe may worshyp endure? Here cometh in Fansy. Fan. Syr, I am here at your pleasure; Your grace sent for me, I wene; what is your wyll? Magn. Come hyther, Largesse, take here Felycyte. Fan. Why, wene you that I can kepe hym longe styll? Magn. To rule as ye lyst, lo, here is Lyberte! Lyb. I am here redy. Fan. What, shall we haue welth at our gydynge to rule as we lyst? Then fare well thryfte, by hym that crosse kyst! Fel. I truste your grace wyll be agreabyll That I shall suffer none impechment By theyr demenaunce nor losse repryuable. Magn. Syr, ye shall folowe myne appetyte and intent. Fel. So it be by mesure I am ryght well content. Fan. What, all by mesure, good syr, and none excesse? Lyb. Why, welth hath made many a man braynlesse. Fel. That was by the menys of to moche lyberte. Magn. What, can ye agree thus and appose? Fel. Syr, as I say, there was no faute in me. Lyb. Ye, of Jacke a thrommys bybyll can ye make a glose. Fan. Sore sayde, I tell you, and well to the purpose: What sholde a man do with you? loke you vnderkay? Fel. I say, it is foly to gyue all welth away. Lyb. Whether sholde welth be rulyd by lyberte, Or lyberte by welth? let se, tell me that. Fel. Syr, as me semeth, ye sholde be rulyd by me. Magn. What nede you with hym thus prate and chat? Fan. Shewe vs your mynde then, howe to do and what. Magn. I say, that I wyll ye haue hym in gydynge. Lyb. Mayster Felycyte, let be your chydynge, And so as ye se it wyll be no better, Take it in worthe suche as ye fynde. Fan. What the deuyll, man, your name shalbe the greter, For welth without largesse is all out of kynde. Lyb. And welth is nought worthe, yf lyberte be behynde. Magn. Nowe holde ye content, for there is none other shyfte. Fel. Than waste must be welcome, and fare well thryfte! Magn. Take of his substaunce a sure inuentory, And get thou home togyther; for Lyberte shall byde, And wayte vpon me. Lyb. And yet for a memory, Make indentures howe ye and I shal gyde. Fan. I can do nothynge but he stonde besyde. Lyb. Syr, we can do nothynge the one without the other. Magn. Well, get you hens than, and sende me some other. Fan. Whom? lusty Pleasure, or mery Consayte? Magn. Nay, fyrst lusty Pleasure is my desyre to haue, And let the other another awayte, Howe be it that fonde felowe is a mery knaue; But loke that ye occupye the auctoryte that I you gaue. [Here goeth out Felycyte, Lyberte, and Fansy. Magnyfycence alone in the place. For nowe, syrs, I am lyke as a prynce sholde be; I haue welth at wyll, largesse and lyberte: Fortune to her lawys can not abandune me, But I shall of Fortune rule the reyne; I fere nothynge Fortunes perplexyte; All honour to me must nedys stowpe and lene; I synge of two partys without a mene; I haue wynde and wether ouer all to sayle, No stormy rage agaynst me can peruayle. Alexander, of Macedony kynge, That all the oryent had in subieccyon, Though al his conquestys were brought to rekenynge, Myght seem ryght wel vnder my proteccyon To rayne, for all his marcyall affeccyon; For I am prynce perlesse prouyd of porte, Bathyd with blysse, embracyd with comforte. Syrus, that soleme syar of Babylon, That Israell releysyd of theyr captyuyte, For al his pompe, for all his ryall trone, He may not be comparyd vnto me. I am the dyamounde dowtlesse of dygnyte: Surely it is I that all may saue and spyll; No man so hardy to worke agaynst my wyll. Porcenya, the prowde prouoste of Turky lande, That ratyd the Romaynes and made them yll rest, Nor Cesar July, that no man myght withstande, Were neuer halfe so rychely as I am drest: No, that I assure you; loke who was the best. I reyne in my robys, I rule as me lyst, I dryue downe th[e]se dastardys with a dynt of my fyste. Of Cato the counte acountyd the cane, Daryus, the doughty cheftayn of Perse, I set not by the prowdest of them a prane, Ne by non other that any man can rehersse. I folowe in felycyte without reue[r]sse, I drede no daunger, I dawnce all in delyte; My name is Magnyfycence, man most of myght. Hercules the herdy, with his stobburne clobbyd mase, That made Cerberus to cache, the cur dogge of hell, And Thesius, that prowde was Pluto to face, It wolde not become them with me for to mell: For of all barones bolde I bere the bell, Of all doughty I am doughtyest duke, as I deme; To me all prynces to lowte man be sene. Cherlemayne, that mantenyd the nobles of Fraunce, Arthur of Albyan, for all his brymme berde, Nor Basyan the bolde, for all his brybaunce, Nor Alerycus, that rulyd the Gothyaunce by swerd, Nor no man on molde can make me aferd. What man is so maysyd with me that dare mete, I shall flappe hym as a fole to fall at my fete. Galba, whom his galantys garde for a gaspe, Nor Nero, that nother set by God nor man, Nor Vaspasyan, that bare in his nose a waspe, Nor Hanyball agayne Rome gates that ranne, Nor yet Cypyo, that noble Cartage wanne, Nor none so hardy of them with me that durste crake, But I shall frounce them on the foretop, and gar them to quake. Here cometh in Courtly Abusyon, doynge reuerence and courtesy. Court. Ab. At your commaundement, syr, wyth all dew reuerence. Magn. Welcom, Pleasure, to our magnyfycence. Court. Ab. Plesyth it your grace to shewe what I do shall? Magn. Let vs here of your pleasure to passe the tyme withall. Court. Ab. Syr, then with the fauour of your benynge sufferaunce To shewe you my mynde myselfe I wyll auaunce, If it lyke your grace to take it in degre. Magn. Yes, syr, so good man in you I se, And in your delynge so good assuraunce, That we delyte gretly in your dalyaunce. Court. Ab. A, syr, your grace me dothe extole and rayse, And ferre beyond my merytys ye me commende and prayse; Howe be it, I wolde be ryght gladde, I you assure, Any thynge to do that myght be to your pleasure. Magn. As I be saued, with pleasure I am supprysyd Of your langage, it is so well deuysed; Pullyshyd and fresshe is your ornacy. Court. Ab. A, I wolde to God that I were halfe so crafty, Or in electe vtteraunce halfe so eloquent, As that I myght your noble grace content! Magn. Truste me, with you I am hyghly pleasyd, For in my fauour I haue you feffyd and seasyd. He is not lyuynge your maners can amend; Mary, your speche is as pleasant as though it were pend; To here your comon, it is my hygh comforte; Poynt deuyse all pleasure is your porte. Court. Ab. Syr, I am the better of your noble reporte; But, of your pacyence vnder the supporte, If it wolde lyke you to here my pore mynde— Magn. Speke, I beseche thé, leue nothynge behynde. Court. Ab. So as ye be a prynce of great myght, It is semynge your pleasure ye delyte, And to aqueynte you with carnall delectacyon, And to fall in aquayntaunce with euery newe facyon; And quyckely your appetytes to sharpe and adresse, To fasten your fansy vpon a fayre maystresse, That quyckly is enuyued with rudyes of the rose, Inpurtured with fetures after your purpose, The streynes of her vaynes as asure inde blewe, Enbudded with beautye and colour fresshe of hewe, As lyly whyte to loke vpon her leyre, Her eyen relucent as carbuncle so clere, Her mouthe enbawmed, dylectable and mery, Her lusty lyppes ruddy as the chery: Howe lyke you? ye lacke, syr, suche a lusty lasse. Magn. A, that were a baby to brace and to basse! I wolde I had, by hym that hell dyd harowe, With me in kepynge suche a Phylyp sparowe! I wolde hauke whylest my hede dyd warke, So I myght hobby for suche a lusty larke. These wordes in myne eyre they be so lustely spoken, That on suche a female my flesshe wolde be wroken; They towche me so thorowly, and tykyll my consayte, That weryed I wolde be on suche a bayte: A, Cockes armes, where myght suche one be founde? Court. Ab. Wyll ye spende ony money? Magn. Ye, a thousande pounde. Court. Ab. Nay, nay, for lesse I waraunt you to be sped, And brought home, and layde in your bed. Magn. Wolde money, trowest thou, make suche one to the call? Court. Ab. Money maketh marchauntes, I tell you, over all. Magn. Why, wyl a maystres be wonne for money and for golde? Court. Ab. Why, was not for money Troy bothe bought and solde? Full many a stronge cyte and towne hath ben wonne By the meanes of money without ony gonne. A maystres, I tell you, is but a small thynge; A goodly rybon, or a golde rynge, May wynne with a sawte the fortresse of the holde; But one thynge I warne you, prece forth and be bolde. Magn. Ye, but some be full koy and passynge harde harted. Court. Ab. But, blessyd be our Lorde, they wyll be sone conuerted. Magn. Why, wyll they then be intreted, the most and the lest? Court. Ab. Ye, for omnis mulier meretrix, si celari potest. Magn. A, I haue spyed ye can moche broken sorowe. Court. Ab. I coude holde you with suche talke hens tyll to morowe; But yf it lyke your grace, more at large Me to permyt my mynde to dyscharge, I wolde yet shewe you further of my consayte. Magn. Let se what ye say, shewe it strayte. Court. Ab. Wysely let these wordes in your mynde be wayed: By waywarde wylfulnes let eche thynge be conuayed; What so euer ye do, folowe your owne wyll; Be it reason or none, it shall not gretely skyll; Be it ryght or wronge, by the aduyse of me, Take your pleasure and vse free lyberte; And yf you se ony thynge agaynst your mynde, Then some occacyon of quarell ye must fynde, And frowne it and face it, as thoughe ye wolde fyght, Frete yourselfe for anger and for dyspyte; Here no man, what so euer they say, But do as ye lyst, and take your owne way. Magn. Thy wordes and my mynde odly well accorde. Court. Ab. What sholde ye do elles? are not you a lorde? Let your lust and lykynge stande for a lawe; Be wrastynge and wrythynge, and away drawe. And ye se a man that with hym ye be not pleased, And that your mynde can not well be eased, As yf a man fortune to touche you on the quyke, Then feyne yourselfe dyseased and make yourselfe seke: To styre vp your stomake you must you forge, Call for a candell and cast vp your gorge; With, Cockes armes, rest shall I none haue Tyll I be reuenged on that horson knaue! A, howe my stomake wambleth! I am all in a swete! Is there no horson that knaue that wyll bete? Magn. By Cockes woundes, a wonder felowe thou arte; For ofte tymes suche a wamblynge goth ouer my harte; Yet I am not harte seke, but that me lyst For myrth I haue hym coryed, beten, and blyst, Hym that I loued not and made hym to loute, I am forthwith as hole as a troute; For suche abusyon I vse nowe and than. Court. Ab. It is none abusyon, syr, in a noble man, It is a pryncely pleasure and a lordly mynde; Suche lustes at large may not be lefte behynde. Here cometh in Cloked Colusyon with Mesure. Cl. Col. Stande styll here, and ye shall se That for your sake I wyll fall on my kne. Court. Ab. Syr, Sober Sadnesse cometh, wherfore it be? Magn. Stande vp, syr, ye are welcom to me. Cl. Col. Please it your grace, at the contemplacyon Of my pore instance and supplycacyon, Tenderly to consyder in your aduertence, Of our blessyd Lorde, syr, at the reuerence, Remembre the good seruyce that Mesure hath you done, And that ye wyll not cast hym away so sone. Magn. My frende, as touchynge to this your mocyon, I may say to you I haue but small deuocyon; Howe be it, at your instaunce I wyll the rather Do as moche as for myne owne father. Cl. Col. Nay, syr, that affeccyon ought to be reserued, For of your grace I haue it nought deserued; But yf it lyke you that I myght rowne in your eyre, To shewe you my mynde I wolde haue the lesse fere. Magn. Stande a lytell abacke, syr, and let hym come hyder. Court. Ab. With a good wyll, syr, God spede you bothe togyder. Cl. Col. Syr, so it is, this man is here by, That for hym to laboure he hath prayde me hartely; Notwithstandynge to you be it sayde, To trust in me he is but dyssayued; For, so helpe me God, for you he is not mete: I speke the softlyer, because he sholde not wete. Magn. Come hyder, Pleasure, you shall here myne entent: Mesure, ye knowe wel, with hym I can not be content, And surely, as I am nowe aduysed, I wyll haue hym rehayted and dyspysed. Howe say ye, syrs? herein what is best? Court. Ab. By myne aduyse with you in fayth he shall not rest. Cl. Col. Yet, syr, reserued your better aduysement, It were better he spake with you or he wente, That he knowe not but that I haue supplyed All that I can his matter for to spede. Magn. Nowe, by your trouthe, gaue he you not a brybe? Cl. Col. Yes, with his hande I made hym to subscrybe A byll of recorde for an annuall rent. Court. Ab. But for all that he is lyke to haue a glent. Cl. Col. Ye, by my trouthe, I shall waraunt you for me, And he go to the deu[y]ll, so that I may haue my fee, What care I? Magn. By the masse, well sayd. Court. Ab. What force ye, so that ye be payde? Cl. Col. But yet, lo, I wolde, or that he wente, Lest that he thought that his money were euyll spente, That ye wolde loke on hym, thoughe it were not longe. Magn. Well cannest thou helpe a preest to synge a songe. Cl. Col. So it is all the maner nowe a dayes, For to vse suche haftynge and crafty wayes. Court. Ab. He telleth you trouth, syr, as I you ensure. Magn. Well, for thy sake the better I may endure That he come hyder, and to gyue hym a loke That he shall lyke the worse all this woke. Cl. Col. I care not howe sone he be refused, So that I may craftely be excused. Court. Ab. Where is he? Cl. Col. Mary, I made hym abyde, Whylest I came to you, a lytell here besyde. Magn. Well, call hym, and let vs here hym reason, And we wyll be comonynge in the mene season. Court. Ab. This is a wyse man, syr, where so euer ye hym had. Magn. An honest person, I tell you, and a sad. Court. Ab. He can full craftely this matter brynge aboute. Magn. Whylest I haue hym, I nede nothynge doute. Hic introducat Colusion Mesure, Magnyfycence aspectant[e] vultu elatissimo. Cl. Col. By the masse, I haue done that I can, And more than euer I dyd for ony man: I trowe, ye herde yourselfe what I sayd. Mes. Nay, indede; but I sawe howe ye prayed, And made instance for me be lykelyhod. Cl. Col. Nay, I tell you, I am not wonte to fode Them that dare put theyr truste in me; And therof ye shall a larger profe se. Mes. Syr, God rewarde you as ye haue deserued: But thynke you with Magnyfycence I shal be reserued? Cl. Col. By my trouth, I can not tell you that; But, and I were as ye, I wolde not set a gnat By Magnyfycence, nor yet none of his, For, go when ye shall, of you shall he mysse. Mes. Syr, as ye say. Cl. Col. Nay, come on with me: Yet ones agayne I shall fall on my kne For your sake, what so euer befall; I set not a flye, and all go to all. Mes. The Holy Goost be with your grace. Cl. Col. Syr, I beseche you, let pety haue some place In your brest towardes this gentylman. Magn. I was your good lorde tyll that ye beganne So masterfully vpon you for to take With my seruauntys, and suche maystryes gan make, That holly my mynde with you is myscontente; Wherfore I wyll that ye be resydent With me no longer. Cl. Col. Say somwhat nowe, let se, for your selfe. Mes. Syr, yf I myght permytted be, I wolde to you say a worde or twayne. Magn. What, woldest thou, lurden, with me brawle agayne? Haue hym hens, I say, out of my syght; That day I se hym, I shall be worse all nyght. [Here Mesure goth out of the place. Court. Ab. Hens, thou haynyarde, out of the dores fast! Magn. Alas, my stomake fareth as it wolde east! Cl. Col. Abyde, syr, abyde, let me holde your hede. Magn. A bolle or a basyn, I say, for Goddes brede! A, my hede! But is the horson gone? God gyue hym a myscheffe! Nay, nowe let me alone. Cl. Col. A good dryfte, syr, a praty fete: By the good Lorde, yet your temples bete. Magn. Nay, so God me helpe, it was no grete vexacyon, For I am panged ofte tymes of this same facyon. Cl. Col. Cockes armes, howe Pleasure plucked hym forth! Magn. Ye, walke he must, it was no better worth. Cl. Col. Syr, nowe me thynke your harte is well eased. Magn. Nowe Measure is gone, I am the better pleased. Cl. Col. So to be ruled by measure, it is a payne. Magn. Mary, I wene he wolde not be glad to come agayne. Cl. Col. So I wote not what he sholde do here: Where mennes belyes is mesured, there is no chere; For I here but fewe men that gyue ony prayse Vnto measure, I say, nowe a days. Magn. Measure, tut! what, the deuyll of hell! Scantly one with measure that wyll dwell. Cl. Col. Not amonge noble men, as the worlde gothe: It is no wonder therfore thoughe ye be wrothe With Mesure. Where as all noblenes is, there I haue past: They catche that catche may, kepe and holde fast, Out of all measure themselfe to enryche; No force what thoughe his neyghbour dye in a dyche. With pollynge and pluckynge out of all measure, Thus must ye stuffe and store your treasure. Magn. Yet somtyme, parde, I must vse largesse. Cl. Col. Ye, mary, somtyme in a messe of vergesse, As in a tryfyll or in a thynge of nought, As gyuynge a thynge that ye neuer bought: It is the gyse nowe, I say, ouer all; Largesse in wordes, for rewardes are but small: To make fayre promyse, what are ye the worse? Let me haue the rule of your purse. Magn. I haue taken it to Largesse and Lyberte. Cl. Col. Than is it done as it sholde be: But vse your largesse by the aduyse of me, And I shall waraunt you welth and lyberte. Magn. Say on; me thynke your reasons be profounde. Cl. Col. Syr, of my counsayle this shall be the grounde, To chose out ii. iii. of suche as you loue best, And let all your fansyes vpon them rest; Spare for no cost to gyue them pounde and peny, Better to make iii. ryche than for to make many; Gyue them more than ynoughe and let them not lacke, And as for all other let them trusse and packe; Plucke from an hundred, and gyue it to thre, Let neyther patent scape them nor fee; And where soeuer you wyll fall to a rekenynge, Those thre wyll be redy euen at your bekenynge, For then shall you haue at lyberte to lowte; Let them haue all, and the other go without: Thus ioy without mesure you shall haue. Magn. Thou sayst truthe, by the harte that God me gaue! For, as thou sayst, ryght so shall it be: And here I make thé vpon Lyberte To be superuysour, and on Largesse also, For as thou wylte, so shall the game go; For in Pleasure, and Surueyaunce, and also in thé, I haue set my hole felycyte, And suche as you wyll shall lacke no promocyon. Cl. Col. Syr, syth that in me ye haue suche deuocyon, Commyttynge to me and to my felowes twayne Your welthe and felycyte, I trust we shall optayne To do you seruyce after your appetyte. Magn. In faythe, and your seruyce ryght well shall I acquyte; And therfore hye you hens, and take this ouersyght. Cl. Col. Nowe, Jesu preserue you, syr, prynce most of myght! Here goth Cloked Colusyon awaye, and leueth Magnyfycence alone in the place. Magn. Thus, I say, I am enuyronned with solace; I drede no dyntes of fatall desteny. Well were that lady myght stande in my grace, Me to enbrace and loue moost specyally: A Lorde, so I wolde halse her hartely, So I wolde clepe her, so I wolde kys her swete! Here cometh in Foly. Fol. Mary, Cryst graunt ye catche no colde on your fete! Magn. Who is this? Fol. Consayte, syr, your owne man. Magn. What tydynges with you, syr? I befole thy brayne pan. Fol. By our lakyn, syr, I haue ben a hawkyng for the wylde swan. My hawke is rammysshe, and it happed that she ran, Flewe I sholde say, in to an olde barne, To reche at a rat, I coude not her warne; She pynched her pynyon, by God, and catched harme: It was a ronner; nay, fole, I warant her blode warme. Magn. A, syr, thy iarfawcon and thou be hanged togyder! Fol. And, syr, as I was comynge to you hyder, I sawe a fox sucke on a kowes ydder, And with a lyme rodde I toke them bothe togyder. I trowe it be a frost, for the way is slydder: Se, for God auowe, for colde as I chydder. Magn. Thy wordes hange togyder as fethers in the wynde. Fol. A, syr, tolde I not you howe I dyd fynde A knaue and a carle, and all of one kynde? I sawe a wethercocke wagge with the wynde; Grete meruayle I had, and mused in my mynde; The houndes ranne before, and the hare behynde; I sawe a losell lede a lurden, and they were bothe blynde; I sawe a sowter go to supper or euer he had dynde. Magn. By Cockes harte, thou arte a fyne mery knaue. Fol. I make God auowe, ye wyll none other men haue. Magn. What sayst thou? Fol. Mary, I pray God your maystershyp to saue: I shall gyue you a gaude of a goslynge that I gaue, The gander and the gose bothe grasynge on one graue; Than Rowlande the reue ran, and I began to raue, And with a brystell of a bore his berde dyd I shaue. Magn. If euer I herde syke another, God gyue me shame. Fol. Sym Sadylgose was my syer, and Dawcocke my dame: I coude, and I lyst, garre you laughe at a game, Howe a wodcocke wrastled with a larke that was lame: The bytter sayd boldly that they were to blame; The feldfare wolde haue fydled, and it wolde not frame; The crane and the curlewe therat gan to grame; The snyte snyueled in the snowte and smyled at the game. Magn. Cockes bones, herde you euer suche another? Fol. Se, syr, I beseche you, Largesse my brother. Here Fansy cometh in. Magn. What tydynges with you, syr, that you loke so sad? Fan. When ye knowe that I knowe, ye wyll not be glad. Fol. What, brother braynsyke, how farest thou? Magn. Ye, let be thy iapes, and tell me howe The case requyreth. Fan. Alasse, alasse, an heuy metynge! I wolde tell you, and yf I myght for wepynge. Fol. What, is all your myrthe nowe tourned to sorowe? Fare well tyll sone, adue tyll to morowe. Here goth Foly away. Magn. I pray thé, Largesse, let be thy sobbynge. Fan. Alasse, syr, ye are vndone with stelyng and robbynge! Ye sent vs a superuysour for to take hede: Take hede of your selfe, for nowe ye haue nede. Magn. What, hath Sadnesse begyled me so? Fan. Nay, madnesse hath begyled you and many mo; For Lyberte is gone and also Felycyte. Magn. Gone? alasse, ye haue vndone me! Fan. Nay, he that ye sent vs, Clokyd Colusyon, And your payntyd Pleasure, Courtly Abusyon, And your demenour with Counterfet Countenaunce, And your suruayour, Crafty Conueyaunce, Or euer we were ware brought vs in aduersyte, And had robbyd you quyte from all felycyte. Magn. Why, is this the largesse that I haue vsyd? Fan. Nay, it was your fondnesse that ye haue vsyd. Magn. And is this the credence that I gaue to the letter? Fan. Why, coulde not your wyt serue you no better? Magn. Why, who wolde haue thought in you suche gyle? Fan. What? yes, by the rode, syr, it was I all this whyle That you trustyd, and Fansy is my name; And Foly, my broder, that made you moche game. Here cometh in Aduersyte. Magn. Alas, who is yonder, that grymly lokys? Fan. Adewe, for I wyll not come in his clokys. Magn. Lorde, so my flesshe trymblyth nowe for drede! Here Magnyfycence is beten downe, and spoylyd from all his goodys and rayment. Aduer. I am Aduersyte, that for thy mysdede From God am sent to quyte thé thy mede. Vyle velyarde, thou must not nowe my dynt withstande, Thou must not abyde the dynt of my hande: Ly there, losell, for all thy pompe and pryde; Thy pleasure now with payne and trouble shalbe tryde. The stroke of God, Aduersyte I hyght; I pluke downe kynge, prynce, lorde, and knyght, I rushe at them rughly, and make them ly full lowe, And in theyr moste truste I make them ouerthrowe. Thys losyll was a lorde, and lyuyd at his lust, And nowe, lyke a lurden, he lyeth in the dust: He knewe not hymselfe, his harte was so hye; Nowe is there no man that wyll set by hym a flye: He was wonte to boste, brage, and to brace; Nowe dare he not for shame loke one in the face: All worldly welth for hym to lytell was; Nowe hath he ryght nought, naked as an asse: Somtyme without measure he trusted in golde, And now without mesure he shal haue hunger and colde. Lo, syrs, thus I handell them all That folowe theyr fansyes in foly to fall: Man or woman, of what estate they be, I counsayle them beware of Aduersyte. Of sorowfull seruauntes I haue many scores: I vysyte them somtyme with blaynes and with sores; With botches and carbuckyls in care I them knyt; With the gowte I make them to grone where they syt; Some I make lyppers and lazars full horse; And from that they loue best some I deuorse; Some with the marmoll to halte I them make; And some to cry out of the bone ake; And some I vysyte with brennynge of fyre; Of some I wrynge of the necke lyke a wyre; And some I make in a rope to totter and walter; And some for to hange themselfe in an halter; And some I vysyte to batayle, warre, and murther, And make eche man to sle other; To drowne or to sle themselfe with a knyfe; And all is for theyr vngracyous lyfe. Yet somtyme I stryke where is none offence, Bycause I wolde proue men of theyr pacyence. But, nowe a dayes, to stryke I haue grete cause, Lydderyns so lytell set by Goddes lawes. Faders and moders, that be neclygent, And suffre theyr chyldren to haue theyr entent, To gyde them vertuously that wyll not remembre, Them or theyr chyldren ofte tymes I dysmembre; Theyr chyldren, bycause that they haue no mekenesse; I vysyte theyr faders and moders with sekenesse; And yf I se therby they wyll not amende, Then myschefe sodaynly I them sende; For there is nothynge that more dyspleaseth God Than from theyr chyldren to spare the rod Of correccyon, but let them haue theyr wyll; Some I make lame, and some I do kyll; And some I stryke with a fransey; Of some of theyr chyldren I stryke out the eye; And where the fader by wysdom worshyp hath wonne, I sende oft tymes a fole to his sonne. Wherfore of Aduersyte loke ye be ware, For when I come, comyth sorowe and care: For I stryke lordys of realmes and landys, That rule not by mesure that they haue in theyr handys, That sadly rule not theyr howsholde men; I am Goddys preposytour, I prynt them with a pen; Because of theyr neglygence and of theyr wanton vagys, I vysyte them and stryke them with many sore plagys. To take, syrs, example of that I you tell, And beware of aduersyte by my counsell, Take hede of this caytyfe that lyeth here on grounde; Beholde, howe Fortune of hym hath frounde! For though we shewe you this in game and play, Yet it proueth eyrnest, ye may se, euery day. For nowe wyll I from this caytyfe go, And take myscheffe and vengeaunce of other mo, That hath deseruyd it as well as he. Howe, where art thou? come hether, Pouerte; Take this caytyfe to thy lore. Here cometh in Pouerte. Pouer. A, my bonys ake, my lymmys be sore; Alasse, I haue the cyatyca full euyll in my hyppe! Alasse, where is youth that was wont for to skyppe? I am lowsy, and vnlykynge, and full of scurffe, My colour is tawny, colouryd as a turffe: I am Pouerte, that all men doth hate, I am baytyd with doggys at euery mannys gate: I am raggyd and rent, as ye may se; Full fewe but they haue enuy at me. Nowe must I this carcasse lyft vp: He dynyd with delyte, with Pouerte he must sup. Ryse vp, syr, and welcom vnto me. Hic accedat ad levandum Magnyfycence, et locabit eum super locum stratum. Magn. Alasse, where is nowe my golde and fe? Alasse, I say, where to am I brought? Alasse, alasse, alasse, I dye for thought! Pouer. Syr, all this wolde haue bene thought on before: He woteth not what welth is that neuer was sore. Magn. Fy, fy, that euer I sholde be brought in this snare! I wenyd ones neuer to haue knowen of care. Pouer. Lo, suche is this worlde! I fynd it wryt, In welth to beware, and that is wyt. Magn. In welth to beware, yf I had grace, Neuer had I bene brought in this case. Pouer. Nowe, syth it wyll no nother be, All that God sendeth, take it in gre; For, thoughe you were somtyme a noble estate, Nowe must you lerne to begge at euery mannes gate. Magn. Alasse, that euer I sholde be so shamed! Alasse, that euer I Magnyfycence was named! Alasse, that euer I was so harde happed, In mysery and wretchydnesse thus to be lapped! Alasse, that I coude not myselfe no better gyde! Alasse, in my cradell that I had not dyde! Pouer. Ye, syr, ye, leue all this rage, And pray to God your sorowes to asswage: It is foly to grudge agaynst his vysytacyon. With harte contryte make you supplycacyon Vnto your Maker, that made bothe you and me, And, whan it pleaseth God, better may be. Magn. Alasse, I wote not what I sholde pray! Pouer. Rem[e]mbre you better, syr, beware what ye say, For drede ye dysplease the hygh deyte. Put your wyll to his wyll, for surely it is he That may restore you agayne to felycyte, And brynge you agayne out of aduersyte. Therfore pouerte loke pacyently ye take, And remembre he suffered moche more for your sake, Howe be it of all synne he was innocent, And ye haue deserued this punysshment. Magn. Alasse, with colde my lymmes shall be marde! Pouer. Ye, syr, nowe must ye lerne to lye harde, That was wonte to lye on fetherbeddes of downe; Nowe must your fete lye hyer than your crowne: Where you were wonte to haue cawdels for your hede, Nowe must you monche mamockes and lumpes of brede; And where you had chaunges of ryche aray, Nowe lap you in a couerlet full fayne that you may; And where that ye were pomped with what that ye wolde, Nowe must ye suffre bothe hunger and colde: With courtely sylkes ye were wonte to be drawe; Nowe must ye lerne to lye on the strawe; Your skynne that was wrapped in shertes of Raynes, Nowe must ye be stormy beten with showres and raynes; Your hede that was wonte to be happed moost drowpy and drowsy, Now shal ye be scabbed, scuruy, and lowsy. Magn. Fye on this worlde, full of trechery, That euer noblenesse sholde lyue thus wretchydly! Pouer. Syr, remembre the tourne of Fortunes whele, That wantonly can wynke, and wynche with her hele. Nowe she wyll laughe, forthwith she wyll frowne; Sodenly set vp, and sodenly pluckyd downe: She dawnsyth varyaunce with mutabylyte; Nowe all in welth, forthwith in pouerte: In her promyse there is no sykernesse; All her delyte is set in doublenesse. Magn. Alas, of Fortune I may well complayne! Pouer. Ye, syr, yesterday wyll not be callyd agayne: But yet, syr, nowe in this case, Take it mekely, and thanke God of his grace; For nowe go I wyll begge for you some mete; It is foly agaynst God for to plete; I wyll walke nowe with my beggers baggys, And happe you the whyles with these homly raggys. Discedendo dicat ista verba. A, howe my lymmys be lyther and lame! Better it is to begge than to be hangyd with shame; Yet many had leuer hangyd to be, Then for to begge theyr mete for charyte: They thynke it no shame to robbe and stele, Yet were they better to begge a great dele; For by robbynge they rynne to in manus tuas quecke, But beggynge is better medecyne for the necke; Ye, mary, is it, ye, so mote I goo: A Lorde God, howe the gowte wryngeth me by the too! Here Magnyfycence dolorously maketh his mone. Magn. O feble fortune, O doulfull destyny! O hatefull happe, O carefull cruelte! O syghynge sorowe, O thoughtfull mysere! O rydlesse rewthe, O paynfull pouerte! O dolorous herte, O harde aduersyte! O odyous dystresse, O dedly payne and woo! For worldly shame I wax bothe wanne and bloo. Where is nowe my welth and my noble estate? Where is nowe my treasure, my landes, and my rent? Where is nowe all my seruauntys that I had here a late? Where is nowe my golde vpon them that I spent? Where is nowe all my ryche abylement? Where is nowe my kynne, my frendys, and my noble blood? Where is nowe all my pleasure and my worldly good? Alasse, my foly! alasse, my wanton wyll! I may no more speke, tyll I haue wept my fyll. [Here cometh in Lyberte.] Lyb. With ye, mary, syrs, thus sholde it be. I kyst her swete, and she kyssyd me; I daunsed the darlynge on my kne; I garde her gaspe, I garde her gle, With, daunce on the le, the le! I bassed that baby with harte so free; She is the bote of all my bale: A, so, that syghe was farre fet! To loue that louesome I wyll not let; My harte is holly on her set: I plucked her by the patlet; At my deuyse I with her met; My fansy fayrly on her I set; So merely syngeth the nyghtyngale! In lust and lykynge my name is Lyberte: I am desyred with hyghest and lowest degre; I lyue as me lyst, I lepe out at large; Of erthely thynge I haue no care nor charge; I am presydent of prynces, I prycke them with pryde: What is he lyuynge that lyberte wolde lacke? A thousande pounde with lyberte may holde no tacke; At lyberte a man may be bolde for to brake; Welthe without lyberte gothe all to wrake. But yet, syrs, hardely one thynge lerne of me: I warne you beware of to moche lyberte, For totum in toto is not worth an hawe; To hardy, or to moche, to free of the dawe; To sober, to sad, to subtell, to wyse; To mery, to mad, to gyglynge, to nyse; To full of fansyes, to lordly, to prowde; To homly, to holy, to lewde, and to lowde; To flatterynge, to smatterynge, to to out of harre, To claterynge, to chaterynge, to shorte, and to farre; To iettynge, to iaggynge, and to full of iapes; To mockynge, to mowynge, to lyke a iackenapes: Thus totum in toto groweth vp, as ye may se, By meanes of madnesse, and to moche lyberte; For I am a vertue, yf I be well vsed, And I am a vyce where I am abused. Magn. A, woo worthe thé, Lyberte, nowe thou sayst full trewe! That I vsed thé to moche, sore may I rewe. Lyb. What, a very vengeaunce, I say, who is that? What brothell, I say, is yonder bounde in a mat? Magn. I am Magnyfycence, that somtyme thy mayster was. Lyb. What, is the worlde thus come to passe? Cockes armes, syrs, wyll ye not se Howe he is vndone by the meanes of me? For yf Measure had ruled Lyberte as he began, This lurden that here lyeth had ben a noble man. But he abused so his free lyberte, That nowe he hath loste all his felycyte, Not thorowe largesse of lyberall expence, But by the way of fansy insolence; For lyberalyte is most conuenyent A prynce to vse with all his hole intent, Largely rewardynge them that haue deseruyd, And so shall a noble man nobly be seruyd: But nowe adayes as huksters they hucke and they stycke, And pynche at the payment of a poddynge prycke; A laudable largesse, I tell you, for a lorde, To prate for the patchynge of a pot sharde! Spare for the spence of a noble, that his honour myght saue, And spende c. ?. for the pleasure of a knaue! But so longe they rekyn with theyr reasons amysse, That they lose theyr lyberte and all that there is. Magn. Alasse, that euer I occupyed suche abusyon! Lyb. Ye, for nowe it hath brought thé to confusyon: For, where I am occupyed and vsyd wylfully, It can not contynew longe prosperyously; As euydently in retchlesse youth ye may se, Howe many come to myschefe for to moche lyberte; And some in the worlde theyr brayne is so ydyll, That they set theyr chyldren to rynne on the brydyll, In youth to be wanton and let them haue theyr wyll; And they neuer thryue in theyr age, it shall not gretly skyll: Some fall to foly them selfe for to spyll, And some fall prechynge at the Toure Hyll; Some hath so moche lyberte of one thynge and other, That nother they set by father and mother; Some haue so moche lyberte that they fere no synne, Tyll, as ye se many tymes, they shame all theyr kynne. I am so lusty to loke on, so freshe, and so fre, That nonnes wyll leue theyr holynes, and ryn after me; Freers with foly I make them so fayne, They cast vp theyr obedyence to cache me agayne, At lyberte to wander and walke ouer all, That lustely they lepe somtyme theyr cloyster wall. Hic aliquis buccat in cornu a retro post populum. Yonder is a horson for me doth rechate: Adewe, syrs, for I thynke leyst that I come to late. Magn. O good Lorde, howe long shall I indure This mysery, this carefull wrechydnesse? Of worldly welthe, alasse, who can be sure? In Fortunys frendshyppe there is no stedfastnesse: She hath dyssayuyd me with her doublenesse. For to be wyse all men may lerne of me, In welthe to beware of herde aduersyte. Here cometh in Crafty Conueyaunce, [and] Cloked Colusyon, with a lusty laughter. Cr. Con. Ha, ha, ha! for laughter I am lyke to brast. Cl. Col. Ha, ha, ha! for sporte I am lyke to spewe and cast. Cr. Con. What hast thou gotted in faythe to thy share? Cl. Col. In faythe, of his cofers the bottoms are bare. Cr. Con. As for his plate of syluer, and suche trasshe, I waraunt you, I haue gyuen it a lasshe. Cl. Col. What, then he may drynke out of a stone cruyse? Cr. Con. With, ye, syr, by Jesu that slayne was with Jewes! He may rynse a pycher, for his plate is to wed. Cl. Col. In faythe, and he may dreme on a daggeswane for ony fether bed. Cr. Con. By my trouthe, we haue ryfled hym metely well. Cl. Col. Ye, but thanke me therof euery dele. Cr. Con. Thanke thé therof, in the deuyls date! Cl. Col. Leue thy pratynge, or els I shall lay thé on the pate. Cr. Con. Nay, to wrangle, I warant thé, it is but a stone caste. Cl. Col. By the messe, I shall cleue thy heed to the waste. Cr. Con. Ye, wylte thou clenly cleue me in the clyfte with thy nose? Cl. Col. I shall thrust in thé my dagger— Cr. Con. Thorowe the legge in to the hose. Cl. Col. Nay, horson, here is my gloue; take it vp, and thou dare. Cr. Con. Torde, thou arte good to be a man of warre. Cl. Col. I shall skelpe thé on the skalpe; lo, seest thou that? Cr. Con. What, wylte thou skelpe me? thou dare not loke on a gnat. Cl. Col. By Cockes bones, I shall blysse thé, and thou be to bolde. Cr. Con. Nay, then thou wylte dynge the deuyll, and thou be not holde. Cl. Col. But wottest thou, horson? I rede thé to be wyse. Cr. Con. Nowe I rede thé beware, I haue warned thé twyse. Cl. Col. Why, wenest thou that I forbere thé for thyne owne sake? Cr. Con. Peas, or I shall wrynge thy be in a brake. Cl. Col. Holde thy hande, dawe, of thy dagger, and stynt of thy dyn, Or I shal fawchyn thy flesshe, and scrape thé on the skyn. Cr. Con. Ye, wylte thou, ha[n]gman? I say, thou cauell! Cl. Col. Nay, thou rude rauener, rayne beten iauell! Cr. Con. What, thou Colyn cowarde, knowen and tryde! Cl. Col. Nay, thou false harted dastarde, thou dare not abyde! Cr. Con. And yf there were none to dysplease but thou and I, Thou sholde not scape, horson, but thou sholde dye. Cl. Col. Nay, iche shall wrynge thé, horson. on the wryst. Cr. Con. Mary, I defye thy best and thy worst. [Here cometh in Counterfet Countenaunce.] C. Count. What, a very vengeaunce, nede all these wordys? Go together by the heddys, and gyue me your swordys. Cl. Col. So he is the worste brawler that euer was borne. Cr. Con. In fayth, so to suffer thé, it is but a skorne. C. Count. Now let vs be all one, and let vs lyue in rest, For we be, syrs, but a fewe of the best. Cl. Col. By the masse, man, thou shall fynde me resonable. Cr. Con. In faythe, and I wyll be to reason agreable. C. Count. Then truste I to God and the holy rode, Here shalbe not great sheddynge of blode. Cl. Col. By our lakyn, syr, not by my wyll. Cr. Con. By the fayth that I owe to God, and I wyll syt styll. C. Count. Well sayd: but, in fayth, what was your quarell? Cl. Col. Mary, syr, this gentylman called me iauell. Cr. Con. Nay, by Saynt Mary, it was ye called me knaue. Cl. Col. Mary, so vngoodly langage you me gaue. C. Count. A, shall we haue more of this maters yet? Me thynke ye are not gretly acomberyd with wyt. Cr. Con. Goddys fote, I warant you, I am a gentylman borne, And thus to be facyd I thynke it great skorne. C. Count. I can not well tell of your dysposycyons; And ye be a gentylman, ye haue knauys condycyons. Cl. Col. By God, I tell you, I wyll not be out facyd. Cr. Con. By the masse, I warant thé, I wyll not be bracyd. C. Count. Tushe, tushe, it is a great defaute: The one of you is to proude, the other is to haute. Tell me brefly where vpon ye began. Cl. Col. Mary, syr, he sayd that he was the pratyer man Then I was, in opynynge of lockys; And, I tell you, I dysdayne moche of his mockys. Cr. Con. Thou sawe neuer yet but I dyd my parte, The locke of a caskyt to make to starte. C. Count. Nay, I know well inough ye are bothe well handyd To grope a gardeuyaunce, though it be well bandyd. Cl. Col. I am the better yet in a bowget. Cr. Con. And I the better in a male. C. Count. Tushe, these maters that ye moue are but soppys in ale: Your trymynge and tramynge by me must be tangyd, For, had I not bene, ye bothe had bene hangyd, When we with Magnyfycence goodys made cheuysaunce. Magn. And therfore our Lorde sende you a very wengaunce! C. Count. What begger art thou that thus doth banne and wary? Magn. Ye be the theuys, I say, away my goodys dyd cary. Cl. Col. Cockys bonys, thou begger, what is thy name? Magn. Magnyfycence I was, whom ye haue brought to shame. C. Count. Ye, but trowe you, syrs, that this is he? Cr. Con. Go we nere, and let vs se. Cl. Col. By Cockys bonys, it is the same. Magn. Alasse, alasse, syrs, ye are to blame! I was your mayster, though ye thynke it skorne, And nowe on me ye gaure and sporne. C. Count. Ly styll, ly styll nowe, with yll hayle! Cr. Con. Ye, for thy langage can not thé auayle. Cl. Col. Abyde, syr, abyde, I shall make hym to pysse. Magn. Nowe gyue me somwhat, for God sake I craue! Cr. Con. In faythe, I gyue thé four quarters of a knaue. C. Count. In faythe, and I bequethe hym the tothe ake. Cl. Col. And I bequethe hym the bone ake. Cr. Con. And I bequethe hym the gowte and the gyn. Cl. Col. And I bequethe hym sorowe for his syn. C. Count. And I gyue hym Crystys curse, With neuer a peny in his purse. Cr. Con. And I gyue hym the cowghe, the murre, and the pose. Cl. Col. Ye, for requiem æternam groweth forth of his nose: But nowe let vs make mery and good chere. C. Count. And to the tauerne let vs drawe nere. Cr. Con. And from thens to the halfe strete, To get vs there some freshe mete. Cl. Col. Why, is there any store of rawe motton? C. Count. Ye, in faythe, or ellys thou arte to great a glotton. Cr. Con. But they say it is a queysy mete; It wyll stryke a man myscheuously in a hete. Cl. Col. In fay, man, some rybbys of the motton be so ranke, That they wyll fyre one vngracyously in the flanke. C. Count. Ye, and when ye come out of the shoppe, Ye shall be clappyd with a coloppe, That wyll make you to halt and to hoppe. Cr. Con. Som be wrestyd there that they thynke on it froty dayes, For there be horys there at all assayes. Cl. Col. For the passyon of God let vs go thyther! Et cum festinatione discedant a loco. Magn. Alas, myne owne seruauntys to shew me such reproche, Thus to rebuke me, and haue me in dyspyght! So shamfully to me theyr mayster to aproche, That somtyme was a noble prynce of myght! Alasse, to lyue longer I haue no delyght! For to lyue in mysery it is herder than dethe: I am wery of the worlde, for vnkyndnesse me sleeth. Hic intrat Dyspare. Dys. Dyspare is my name, that aduersyte doth folowe: In tyme of dystresse I am redy at hande; I make heuy hertys with eyen full holowe; Of faruent charyte I quenche out the bronde; Faythe and goodhope I make asyde to stonde; In Goddys mercy I tell them is but foly to truste; All grace and pyte I lay in the duste. What lyest thou there lyngrynge, lewdly and lothsome? It is to late nowe thy synnys to repent; Thou hast bene so waywarde, so wranglyng, and so wrothsome, And so fer thou arte behynde of thy rent, And so vngracyously thy dayes thou hast spent, That thou arte not worthy to loke God in the face. Magn. Nay, nay, man, I loke neuer to haue parte of his grace; For I haue so vngracyously my lyfe mysusyd, Though I aske mercy, I must nedys be refusyd. Dys. No, no, for thy synnys be so excedynge farre, So innumerable and so full of dyspyte, And agayne thy Maker thou hast made suche warre, That thou canst not haue neuer mercy in hys syght. Magn. Alasse, my wyckydnesse, that may I wyte! But nowe I se well there is no better rede, But sygh and sorowe, and wysshe my selfe dede. Dys. Ye, ryd thy selfe, rather than this lyfe for to lede; The worlde waxyth wery of thé, thou lyuest to longe. Hic intrat Myschefe. Mys. And I, Myschefe, am comyn at nede, Out of thy lyfe thé for to lede: And loke that it be not longe Or that thy selfe thou go honge With this halter good and stronge; Or ellys with this knyfe cut out a tonge Of thy throte bole, and ryd thé out of payne: Thou arte not the fyrst hymselfe hath slayne. Lo, here is thy knyfe and a halter! and, or we go ferther, Spare not thy selfe, but boldly thé murder. Dys. Ye, haue done at ones without delay. Magn. Shall I myself hange with an halter? nay; Nay, rather wyll I chose to ryd me of this lyue In styckynge my selfe with this fayre knyfe. Here Magnyfycence wolde slee hymselfe with a knyfe. Mys. Alarum, alarum! to longe we abyde! Dys. Out, harowe, hyll burneth! where shall I me hyde? Hic intrat Goodhope, fugientibus Dyspayre et Myschefe: repente Goodhope surripiat illi gladium, et dicat. Good. Alas, dere sone, sore combred is thy mynde, Thyselfe that thou wolde sloo agaynst nature and kynde! Magn. A, blessyd may ye be, syr! what shall I you call? Good. Goodhope, syr, my name is; remedy pryncypall Agaynst all sautes of your goostly foo: Who knoweth me, hymselfe may neuer sloo. Magn. Alas, syr, so I am lapped in aduersyte, That dyspayre well nyghe had myscheued me! For, had ye not the soner ben my refuge, Of dampnacyon I had ben drawen in the luge. Good. Vndoubted ye had lost yourselfe eternally: There is no man may synne more mortally Than of wanhope thrughe the vnhappy wayes, By myschefe to breuyate and shorten his dayes: But, my good sonne, lerne from dyspayre to flee, Wynde you from wanhope, and aquaynte you with me. A grete mysaduenture, thy Maker to dysplease, Thyselfe myscheuynge to thyne endlesse dysease! There was neuer so harde a storme of mysery, But thrughe goodhope there may come remedy. Magn. Your wordes be more sweter than ony precyous narde, They molefy so easely my harte that was so harde; There is no bawme, ne gumme of Arabe, More delectable than your langage to me. Good. Syr, your fesycyan is the grace of God, That you hath punysshed with his sharpe rod. Goodhope, your potecary assygned am I: That Goddes grace hath vexed you sharply, And payned you with a purgacyon of odyous pouerte, Myxed with bytter alowes of herde aduersyte; Nowe must I make you a lectuary softe, I to mynyster it, you to receyue it ofte, With rubarbe of repentaunce in you for to rest; With drammes of deuocyon your dyet must be drest; With gommes goostly of glad herte and mynde, To thanke God of his sonde, and comforte ye shal fynde. Put fro you presumpcyon and admyt humylyte, And hartely thanke God of your aduersyte; And loue that Lorde that for your loue was dede, Wounded from the fote to the crowne of the hede: For who loueth God can ayle nothynge but good; He may helpe you, he may mende your mode: Prosperyte to hym is gyuen solacyusly to man, Aduersyte to hym therwith nowe and than; Helthe of body his besynesse to acheue, Dysease and sekenesse his conscyence to dyscryue, Afflyccyon and trouble to proue his pacyence, Contradyccyon to proue his sapyence, Grace of assystence his measure to declare, Somtyme to fall, another tyme to beware: And nowe ye haue had, syr, a wonderous fall, To lerne you hereafter for to beware withall. Howe say you, syr? can ye these wordys grope? Magn. Ye, syr, nowe am I armyd with goodhope, And sore I repent me of my wylfulnesse: I aske God mercy of my neglygence, Vnder goodhope endurynge euer styll, Me humbly commyttynge vnto Goddys wyll. Good. Then shall you be sone delyuered from dystresse, For nowe I se comynge to youwarde Redresse. Hic intrat Redresse. Red. Cryst be amonge you and the Holy Goste! Good. He be your conducte, the Lorde of myghtys moste! Red. Syr, is your pacyent any thynge amendyd? Good. Ye, syr, he is sory for that he hath offendyd. Red. How fele you your selfe, my frend? how is your mynde? Magn. A wrechyd man, syr, to my Maker vnkynde. Red. Ye, but haue ye repentyd you with harte contryte? Magn. Syr, the repentaunce I haue, no man can wryte. Red. And haue ye banyshed from you all dyspare? Magn. Ye, holly to goodhope I haue made my repare. Good. Questyonlesse he doth me assure In goodhope alway for to indure. Red. Than stande vp, syr, in Goddys name! And I truste to ratyfye and amende your fame. Goodhope, I pray you with harty affeccyon To sende ouer to me Sad Cyrcumspeccyon. Good. Syr, your requeste shall not be delayed. Et exeat. Red. Now surely, Magnyfycence, I am ryght well apayed Of that I se you nowe in the state of grace; Nowe shall ye be renewyd with solace: Take nowe vpon you this abylyment, And to that I say gyue good aduysement. Magnyfycence accipiat indumentum. Magn. To your requeste I shall be confyrmable. Red. Fyrst, I saye, with mynde fyrme and stable Determyne to amende all your wanton excesse, And be ruled by me, whiche am called Redresse: Redresse my name is, that lytell am I vsed As the worlde requyreth, but rather I am refused: Redresse sholde be at the rekenynge in euery accompte, And specyally to redresse that were out of ioynte: Full many thynges there be that lacketh redresse, The whiche were to longe nowe to expresse; But redresse is redlesse, and may do no correccyon. Nowe welcome forsoth, Sad Cyrcumspeccyon. Here cometh in Sad Cyrcumspeccyon, sayenge, Sad Cyr. Syr, after your message I hyed me hyder streyght, For to vnderstande your pleasure and also your mynde. Red. Syr, to accompte you the contynewe of my consayte, Is from aduersyte Magnyfycence to vnbynde. Sad Cyr. How fortuned you, Magnyfycence, so far to fal behynde? Magn. Syr, the longe absence of you, Sad Cyrcumspeccyon, Caused me of aduersyte to fall in subieccyon. Red. All that he sayth, of trouthe doth procede; For where sad cyrcumspeccyon is longe out of the way, Of aduersyte it is to stande in drede. Sad Cyr. Without fayle, syr, that is no nay; Cyrcumspeccyon inhateth all rennynge astray. But, syr, by me to rule fyrst ye began. Magn. My wylfulnesse, syr, excuse I ne can. Sad Cyr. Then ye repent you of foly in tymes past? Magn. Sothely, to repent me I haue grete cause: Howe be it from you I receyued a letter, Whiche conteyned in it a specyall clause That I sholde vse largesse. Sad Cyr. Nay, syr, there a pause. Red. Yet let vs se this matter thorowly ingrossed. Magn. Syr, this letter ye sent to me, at Pountes was enclosed. Sad Cyr. Who brought you that letter, wote ye what he hyght? Magn. Largesse, syr, by his credence was his name. Sad Cyr. This letter ye speke of, neuer dyd I wryte. Red. To gyue so hasty credence ye were moche to blame. Magn. Truth it is, syr; for after he wrought me moch shame, And caused me also to vse to moche lyberte, And made also mesure to be put fro me. Red. Then welthe with you myght in no wyse abyde. Sad Cyr. A ha! fansy and foly met with you, I trowe. Red. It wolde be founde so, yf it were well tryde. Magn. Surely my welthe with them was ouerthrow. Sad Cyr. Remembre you, therfore, howe late ye were low. Red. Ye, and beware of vnhappy abusyon. Sad Cyr. And kepe you from counterfaytynge of clokyd colusyon. Magn. Syr, in goodhope I am to amende. Red. Vse not then your countenaunce for to counterfet. Sad Cyr. And from crafters and hafters I you forfende. Hic intrat Perseueraunce. Magn. Well, syr, after your counsell my mynde I wyll set. Red. What, brother Perceueraunce! surely well met. Sad Cyr. Ye com hether as well as can be thought. Per. I herde say that Aduersyte with Magnyfycence had fought. Magn. Ye, syr, with aduersyte I haue bene vexyd; But goodhope and redresse hath mendyd myne estate, And sad cyrcumspeccyon to me they haue annexyd. Red. What this man hath sayd, perceyue ye his sentence? Magn. Ye, syr, from hym my corage shall neuer flyt. Sad Cyr. Accordynge to treuth they be well deuysyd. Magn. Syrs, I am agreed to abyde your ordenaunce, Faythfull assuraunce with good peraduertaunce. Per. Yf you be so myndyd, we be ryght glad. Red. And ye shall haue more worshyp then euer ye had. Magn. Well, I perceyue in you there is moche sadnesse, Grauyte of counsell, prouydence, and wyt; Your comfortable aduyse and wyt excedyth all gladnesse. But frendly I wyll refrayne you ferther, or we flyt, Whereto were most metely my corage to knyt: Your myndys I beseche you here in to expresse, Commensynge this processe at mayster Redresse. Red. Syth vnto me formest this processe is erectyd, Herein I wyll aforse me to shewe you my mynde. Fyrst, from your magnyfycence syn must be abiectyd, In all your warkys more grace shall ye fynde; Be gentyll then of corage, and lerne to be kynde, For of noblenesse the chefe poynt is to be lyberall, So that your largesse be not to prodygall. Sad Cyr. Lyberte to a lorde belongyth of ryght, But wylfull waywardnesse muste walke out of the way; Measure of your lustys must haue the ouersyght, And not all the nygarde nor the chyncherde to play; Let neuer negarshyp your noblenesse affray; In your rewardys vse suche moderacyon That nothynge be gyuen without consyderacyon. Per. To the increse of your honour then arme you with ryght, And fumously adresse you with magnanymyte; And euer let the drede of God be in your syght; And knowe your selfe mortall, for all your dygnyte; Set not all your affyaunce in Fortune full of gyle; Remember this lyfe lastyth but a whyle. Magn. Redresse, in my remembraunce your lesson shall rest, And Sad Cyrcumspeccyon I marke in my mynde; But, Perseueraunce, me semyth your probleme was best; I shall it neuer forget nor leue it behynde, But hooly to perseueraunce my selfe I wyll bynde, Of that I haue mysdone to make a redresse, And with sad cyrcumspeccyon correcte my vantonnesse. Red. Vnto this processe brefly compylyd, Comprehendyng the worlde casuall and transytory, Who lyst to consyder shall neuer be begylyd, Yf it be regystryd well in memory; A playne example of worldly vaynglory, Howe in this worlde there is no seke[r]nesse, But fallyble flatery enmyxyd with bytternesse; Nowe well, nowe wo, nowe hy, nowe lawe degre, Nowe ryche, nowe pore, nowe hole, nowe in dysease, Nowe pleasure at large, nowe in captyuyte, Nowe leue, nowe lothe, now please, nowe dysplease, Now ebbe, now flowe, nowe increase, now dyscrease; So in this worlde there is no sykernesse, But fallyble flatery enmyxyd with bytternesse. Sad Cyr. A myrrour incleryd is this interlude, This lyfe inconstant for to beholde and se; Sodenly auaunsyd, and sodenly subdude, Sodenly ryches, and sodenly pouerte, Sodenly comfort, and sodenly aduersyte; Sodenly thus Fortune can bothe smyle and frowne, Sodenly set vp, and sodenly cast downe; Sodenly promotyd, and sodenly put backe, Sodenly cherysshyd, and sodenly cast asyde, Sodenly commendyd, and sodenly fynde a lacke, Sodenly grauntyd, and sodenly denyed, Sodenly hyd, and sodenly spyed; Sodenly thus Fortune can bothe smyle and frowne, Sodenly set vp, and sodenly cast downe. Per. This treatyse, deuysyd to make you dysporte, Shewyth nowe adayes howe the worlde comberyd is, To the pythe of the mater who lyst to resorte; To day it is well, to morowe it is all amysse, To day in delyte, to morowe bare of blysse, To day a lorde, to morowe ly in the duste; Thus in this worlde there is no erthly truste; To day fayre wether, to morowe a stormy rage, To day hote, to morowe outragyous colde, To day a yoman, to morowe made of page, To day in surety, to morowe bought and solde, To day maysterfest, to morowe he hath no holde, To day a man, to morowe he lyeth in the duste; Thus in this worlde there is no erthly truste. Magn. This mater we haue mouyd, you myrthys to make, Precely purposyd vnder pretence of play, Shewyth wysdome to them that wysdome can take, Howe sodenly worldly welth dothe dekay, How wysdom thorowe wantonnesse vanysshyth away, How none estate lyuynge of hymselfe can be sure, For the welthe of this worlde can not indure; Of the terestre rechery we fall in the flode, Beten with stormys of many a frowarde blast, Ensordyd with the wawys sauage and wode, Without our shyppe be sure, it is lykely to brast, Yet of magnyfycence oft made is the mast; Thus none estate lyuynge of hym can be sure, For the welthe of this worlde can not indure. Red. Nowe semeth vs syttynge that ye then resorte Home to your paleys with ioy and ryalte. Sad Cyr. Where euery thyng is ordenyd after your noble porte. Per. There to indeuer with all felycyte. Magn. I am content, my frendys, that it so be. Red. And ye that haue harde this dysporte and game, Jhesus preserue you frome endlesse wo and shame! Amen. COLYN CLOUTE. HERE AFTER FOLOWETH A LITEL BOKE CALLED COLYN CLOUTE, COMPYLED BY MAYSTER SKELTON, POETE LAUREATE. Quis consurget mecum adversus malignantes? aut quis stabit mecum adversus operantes iniquitatem? Nemo, Domine! What can it auayle To dryue forth a snayle, Or to make a sayle Of an herynges tayle; To ryme or to rayle, To wryte or to indyte, Eyther for delyte Or elles for despyte; Or bokes to compyle Of dyuers maner style, Vyce to reuyle And synne to exyle; To teche or to preche, As reason wyll reche? Say this, and say that, His hed is so fat, He wotteth neuer what Nor wherof he speketh; He cryeth and he creketh, He pryeth and he peketh, He chydes and he chatters, He prates and he patters, He clytters and he clatters, He medles and he smatters, He gloses and he flatters; Or yf he speake playne, Than he lacketh brayne, He is but a fole; Let hym go to scole, On a thre foted stole That he may downe syt, For he lacketh wyt; And yf that he hyt The nayle on the hede, It standeth in no stede; The deuyll, they say, is dede, The deuell is dede. It may well so be, Or els they wolde se Otherwyse, and fle From worldly vanyte, And foule couetousnesse, And other wretchednesse, Fyckell falsenesse, Varyablenesse, With vnstablenesse. And if ye stande in doubte Who brought this ryme aboute, My name is Colyn Cloute. I purpose to shake oute All my connyng bagge, Lyke a clerkely hagge; For though my ryme be ragged, Tattered and iagged, Rudely rayne beaten, Rusty and moughte eaten, If ye take well therwith, It hath in it some pyth. For, as farre as I can se, It is wronge with eche degre: For the temporalte Accuseth the spiritualte; The spirituall agayne Dothe grudge and complayne Vpon the temporall men: Thus eche of other blother The tone agayng the tother: Alas, they make me shoder! For in hoder moder The Churche is put in faute; The prelates ben so haut, They say, and loke so hy, As though they wolde fly Aboue the sterry skye. Laye men say indede How they take no hede Theyr sely shepe to fede, But plucke away and pull The fleces of theyr wull, Vnethes they leue a locke Of wull amonges theyr flocke; And as for theyr connynge, A glommynge and a mummynge, And make therof a iape; They gaspe and they gape All to haue promocyon, There is theyr hole deuocyon, With money, if it wyll hap, To catche the forked cap: Forsothe they are to lewd To say so, all beshrewd! What trow ye they say more Of the bysshoppes lore? How in matters they be rawe, They lumber forth the lawe, To herken Jacke and Gyll, Whan they put vp a byll, And iudge it as they wyll, For other mennes skyll, Expoundyng out theyr clauses, And leue theyr owne causes: In theyr prouynciall cure They make but lytell sure, And meddels very lyght In the Churches ryght; But ire and venire, And solfa so alamyre, That the premenyre Is lyke to be set a fyre In theyr iurisdictions Through temporall afflictions: Men say they haue prescriptions Agaynst spirituall contradictions, Accomptynge them as fyctions. And whyles the heedes do this, The remenaunt is amys Of the clergy all, Bothe great and small. I wot neuer how they warke, But thus the people barke; And surely thus they say, Bysshoppes, if they may, Small houses wolde kepe, But slumbre forth and slepe, And assay to crepe Within the noble walles Of the kynges halles, To fat theyr bodyes full, Theyr soules lene and dull, And haue full lytell care How euyll theyr shepe fare. The temporalyte say playne, Howe bysshoppes dysdayne Sermons for to make, Or suche laboure to take; And for to say trouth, A great parte is for slouth, But the greattest parte Is for they haue but small arte And ryght sklender connyng Within theyr heedes wonnyng. But this reason they take How they are able to make With theyr golde and treasure Clerkes out of measure, And yet that is a pleasure. Howe be it some there be, Almost two or thre, Of that dygnyte, Full worshypfull clerkes, As appereth by theyr werkes, Lyke Aaron and Ure, The wolfe from the dore To werryn and to kepe From theyr goostly shepe, And theyr spirituall lammes Sequestred from rammes And from the berded gotes With theyr heery cotes; Set nought by golde ne grotes, Theyr names if I durst tell. But they are loth to mell, And loth to hang the bell Aboute the cattes necke, For drede to haue a checke; They ar fayne to play deuz decke, They ar made for the becke. How be it they are good men, Moche herted lyke an hen: Theyr lessons forgotten they haue That Becket them gaue: Thomas manum mittit ad fortia, Spernit damna, spernit opprobria, Nulla Thomam frangit injuria. But nowe euery spirituall father, Men say, they had rather Spende moche of theyr share Than to be combred with care: Spende! nay, nay, but spare; For let se who that dare Sho the mockysshe mare; They make her wynche and keke, But it is not worth a leke: Boldnesse is to seke The Churche for to defend. Take me as I intende, For lothe I am to offende In this that I haue pende: I tell you as men say; Amende whan ye may, For, usque ad montem Sare, Men say ye can not appare; For some say ye hunte in parkes, And hauke on hobby larkes, And other wanton warkes, Whan the nyght darkes. What hath lay men to do The gray gose for to sho? Lyke houndes of hell, They crye and they yell, Howe that ye sell The grace of the Holy Gost: Thus they make theyr bost Through owte euery cost, Howe some of you do eate In Lenton season fleshe mete, Fesauntes, partryche, and cranes; Men call you therfor prophanes; Ye pycke no shrympes nor pranes, Saltfysshe, stocfysshe, nor heryng, It is not for your werynge; Nor in holy Lenton season Ye wyll netheyr benes ne peason, But ye loke to be let lose To a pygge or to a gose, Your gorge not endewed Without a capon stewed, Or a stewed cocke, To knowe whate ys a clocke Vnder her surfled smocke, And her wanton wodicocke. And howe whan ye gyue orders In your prouinciall borders, As at Sitientes, Some are insufficientes, Some parum sapientes, Some nihil intelligentes, Some valde negligentes, Some nullum sensum habentes, But bestiall and vntaught; But whan thei haue ones caught Dominus vobiscum by the hede, Than renne they in euery stede, God wot, with dronken nolles; Yet take they cure of soules, And woteth neuer what thei rede, Paternoster, Ave, nor Crede; Construe not worth a whystle Nether Gospell nor Pystle; Theyr mattyns madly sayde, Nothynge deuoutly prayde; Theyr lernynge is so small, Theyr prymes and houres fall And lepe out of theyr lyppes Lyke sawdust or drye chyppes. I speke not nowe of all, But the moost parte in generall. Of suche vagabundus Speketh totus mundus; Howe some synge Lætabundus At euery ale stake, With, welcome hake and make! By the brede that God brake, I am sory for your sake. I speke not of the good wyfe, But of theyr apostles lyfe; Cum ipsis vel illis Qui manent in villis Est uxor vel ancilla, Welcome Jacke and Gylla! My prety Petronylla, And you wyll be stylla, You shall haue your wylla. Of suche Paternoster pekes All the worlde spekes. In you the faute is supposed, For that they are not apposed By iust examinacyon In connyng and conuersacyon; They haue none instructyon To make a true constructyon: A preest without a letter, Without his vertue be gretter, Doutlesse were moche better Vpon hym for to take A mattocke or a rake. Alas, for very shame! Some can not declyne their name; Some can not scarsly rede, And yet he wyll not drede For to kepe a cure, And in nothyng is sure; This Dominus vobiscum, As wyse as Tom a thrum, A chaplayne of trust Layth all in the dust. Thus I, Colyn Cloute, As I go aboute, And wandrynge as I walke, I here the people talke. Men say, for syluer and golde Myters are bought and solde; There shall no clergy appose A myter nor a crose, But a full purse: A strawe for Goddes curse! What are they the worse? For a symonyake Is but a hermoniake; And no more ye make Of symony, men say, But a chyldes play. Ouer this, the foresayd laye Reporte howe the Pope may An holy anker call Out of the stony wall, And hym a bysshopp make, If he on hym dare take To kepe so harde a rule, To ryde vpon a mule With golde all betrapped, In purple and paule belapped; Some hatted and some capped, Rychely and warme bewrapped, God wot to theyr great paynes, In rotchettes of fyne Raynes, Whyte as morowes mylke; Theyr tabertes of fyne silke, Theyr styrops of myxt gold begared; There may no cost be spared; Theyr moyles golde dothe eate, Theyr neyghbours dye for meate. What care they though Gil sweate, Or Jacke of the Noke? The pore people they yoke With sommons and citacyons And excommunycacyons, About churches and market: The bysshop on his carpet At home full softe dothe syt. This is a farly fyt, To here the people iangle, Howe warely they wrangle: Alas, why do ye not handle And them all to-mangle? Full falsely on you they lye, And shamefully you ascrye, And say as vntruely, As the butterflye A man myght saye in mocke Ware the wethercocke Of the steple of Poules; And thus they hurte theyr soules In sclaunderyng you for truthe: Alas, it is great ruthe! Some say ye syt in trones, Lyke prynces aquilonis, And shryne your rotten bones With perles and precyous stones; But how the commons grones, And the people mones For prestes and for lones Lent and neuer payd, But from day to day delayde, The commune welth decayde, Men say ye are tonge tayde, And therof speke nothynge But dyssymulyng and glosyng. Wherfore men be supposyng That ye gyue shrewd counsell Agaynst the commune well, By poollynge and pyllage In cytyes and vyllage, By taxyng and tollage, Ye make monkes to haue the culerage For couerynge of an olde cottage, That commytted is a collage In the charter of dottage, Tenure par seruyce de sottage, And not par seruyce de socage, After olde seygnyours, And the lerning of Lytelton tenours: Ye haue so ouerthwarted, That good lawes are subuerted, And good reason peruerted. Relygous men are fayne For to tourne agayne In secula seculorum, And to forsake theyr corum, And vagabundare per forum, And take a fyne meritorum, Contra regulam morum, Aut blacke monachorum, Aut canonicorum, Aut Bernardinorum, Aut crucifixorum, And to synge from place to place, Lyke apostataas. And the selfe same game Begone ys nowe with shame Amongest the sely nonnes: My lady nowe she ronnes, Dame Sybly our abbesse, Dame Dorothe and lady Besse, Dame Sare our pryoresse, Out of theyr cloyster and quere With an heuy chere, Must cast vp theyr blacke vayles, And set vp theyr fucke sayles, To catch wynde with their ventales— What, Colyne, there thou shales! Yet thus with yll hayles The lay fee people rayles. And all the fawte they lay On you, prelates, and say Ye do them wrong and no ryght To put them thus to flyght; No matyns at mydnyght, Boke and chalys gone quyte; And plucke awaye the leedes Evyn ouer theyr heedes, And sell away theyr belles, And all that they haue elles: Thus the people telles, Rayles lyke rebelles, Redys shrewdly and spelles, And with foundacyons melles, And talkys lyke tytyuelles, Howe ye brake the dedes wylles, Turne monasteris into water milles, Of an abbay ye make a graunge; Your workes, they saye, are straunge; So that theyr founders soules Haue lost theyr beade rolles, The mony for theyr masses Spent amonge wanton lasses; The Diriges are forgotten; Theyr founders lye theyr rotten, But where theyr soules dwell, Therwith I wyll not mell. What coulde the Turke do more With all his false lore, Turke, Sarazyn, or Jew? I reporte me to you, O mercyfull Jesu, You supporte and rescue, My style for to dyrecte, It may take some effecte! For I abhorre to wryte Howe the lay fee dyspyte You prelates, that of ryght Shulde be lanternes of lyght. Ye lyue, they say, in delyte, Drowned in deliciis, In gloria et divitiis, In admirabili honore, In gloria, et splendore Fulgurantis hastæ, Viventes parum caste: Yet swete meate hath soure sauce, For after gloria, laus, Chryst by cruelte Was nayled vpon a tre; He payed a bytter pencyon For mannes redemcyon, He dranke eysell and gall To redeme vs withall; But swete ypocras ye drynke, With, Let the cat wynke! Iche wot what yche other thynk; Howe be it per assimile Some men thynke that ye Shall haue penalte For your iniquyte. Nota what I say, And bere it well away; If it please not theologys, It is good for astrologys; For Ptholome tolde me The sonne somtyme to be In Ariete, Ascendent a degre, Whan Scorpion descendynge, Was so then pretendynge A fatall fall of one That shuld syt on a trone, And rule all thynges alone. Your teth whet on this bone Amongest you euerychone, And let Collyn Cloute haue none Maner of cause to mone: Lay salue to your owne sore, For els, as I sayd before, After gloria, laus, May come a soure sauce; Sory therfore am I, But trouth can neuer lye. With language thus poluted Holy Churche is bruted And shamfully confuted. My penne nowe wyll I sharpe, And wrest vp my harpe With sharpe twynkyng trebelles, Agaynst all suche rebelles That laboure to confounde And bryng the Churche to the grounde; As ye may dayly se Howe the lay fee Of one affynyte Consent and agre Agaynst the Churche to be, And the dygnyte Of the bysshoppes see. And eyther ye be to bad, Or els they ar mad Of this to reporte: But, vnder your supporte, Tyll my dyenge day I shall bothe wryte and say, And ye shall do the same, Howe they are to blame You thus to dyffame: For it maketh me sad Howe that the people are glad The Churche to depraue; And some there are that raue, Presumynge on theyr wyt, Whan there is neuer a whyt, To maynteyne argumentes Agaynst the sacramentes. Some make epylogacyon Of hyghe predestynacyon; And of resydeuacyon They make interpretacyon Of an aquarde facyon; And of the prescience Of dyuyne essence; And what ipostacis Of Christes manhode is. Suche logyke men wyll chop, And in theyr fury hop, When the good ale sop Dothe daunce in theyr fore top; Bothe women and men, Suche ye may well knowe and ken, That agaynst preesthode Theyr malyce sprede abrode, Raylynge haynously And dysdaynously Of preestly dygnytes, But theyr malygnytes. And some haue a smacke Of Luthers sacke, And a brennyng sparke Of Luthers warke, And are somewhat suspecte In Luthers secte; And some of them barke, Clatter and carpe Of that heresy arte Called Wicleuista, The deuelysshe dogmatista; And some be Hussyans, And some be Arryans, And some be Pollegians, And make moche varyans Bytwene the clergye And the temporaltye. Howe the Church hath to mykel, And they haue to lytell, And bryng in materialites And qualyfyed qualytes; Of pluralytes, Of tryalytes, And of tot quottes, They commune lyke sottes, As commeth to theyr lottes; Of prebendaries and deanes, Howe some of them gleanes And gathereth vp the store For to catche more and more; Of persons and vycaryes They make many outcryes; They cannot kepe theyr wyues From them for theyr lyues; And thus the loselles stryues, And lewdely sayes by Christ Agaynst the sely preest. Alas, and well away, What ayles them thus to say? They mought be better aduysed Then to be so dysgysed: But they haue enterprysed, And shamfully surmysed, Howe prelacy is solde and bought, And come vp of nought; And where the prelates be Come of lowe degre, And set in maieste And spirituall dyngnyte, Farwell benygnyte, Farwell symplicite, Farwell humylyte, Farwell good charyte! Ye are so puffed wyth pryde, That no man may abyde Your hygh and lordely lokes: Ye cast vp then your bokes, And vertue is forgotten; For then ye wyll be wroken Of euery lyght quarell, And call a lorde a iauell, A knyght a knaue ye make; Ye bost, ye face, ye crake, And vpon you ye take To rule bothe kynge and kayser; And yf ye may haue layser, Ye wyll brynge all to nought, And that is all your thought: For the lordes temporall, Theyr rule is very small, Almost nothyng at all. Men saye howe ye appall The noble blode royall: In ernest and in game, Ye are the lesse to blame, For lordes of noble blode, If they well vnderstode How connyng myght them auaunce, They wold pype you another daunce: But noble men borne To lerne they haue scorne, But hunt and blowe an horne, Lepe ouer lakes and dykes, Set nothyng by polytykes; Therfore ye kepe them bace, And mocke them to theyr face: This is a pyteous case, To you that ouer the whele Grete lordes must crouche and knele, And breke theyr hose at the kne, As dayly men may se, And to remembraunce call, Fortune so turneth the ball And ruleth so ouer all, That honoure hath a great fall. Shall I tell you more? ye, shall. I am loth to tell all; But the communalte yow call Ydolles of Babylon, De terra Zabulon, De terra Neptalym; For ye loue to go trym, Brought vp of poore estate, With pryde inordinate, Sodaynly vpstarte From the donge carte, The mattocke and the shule, To reygne and to rule; And haue no grace to thynke Howe ye were wonte to drynke Of a lether bottell With a knauysshe stoppell, Whan mamockes was your meate, With moldy brede to eate; Ye cowde none other gete To chewe and to gnawe, To fyll therwith your mawe; Loggyng in fayre strawe, Couchyng your drousy heddes Somtyme in lousy beddes. Alas, this is out of mynde! Ye growe nowe out of kynde: Many one ye haue vntwynde, And made the commons blynde. But qui se existimat stare, Let hym well beware Lest that his fote slyp, And haue suche a tryp, And falle in suche dekay, That all the worlde may say, Come downe, in the deuyll way! Yet, ouer all that, Of bysshops they chat, That though ye round your hear An ynche aboue your ear, And haue aures patentes And parum intendentes, And your tonsors be croppyd, Your eares they be stopped; For maister Adulator, And doctour Assentator, And Blandior blandiris, With Mentior mentiris, They folowe your desyres, And so they blere your eye, That ye can not espye Howe the male dothe wrye. Alas, for Goddes wyll, Why syt ye, prelates, styll, And suffre all this yll? Ye bysshops of estates Shulde open the brode gates Of your spirituall charge, And com forthe at large, Lyke lanternes of lyght, In the peoples syght, In pullpettes awtentyke, For the wele publyke Of preesthode in this case; And alwayes to chase Suche maner of sysmatykes And halfe heretykes, That wolde intoxicate, That wolde conquinate, That wolde contaminate, And that wolde vyolate, And that wolde derogate, And that wolde abrogate The Churchis hygh estates, After this maner rates, The which shulde be Both franke and free, And haue theyr lyberte, As of antiquyte It was ratefyed, And also gratifyed, By holy synodalles And bulles papalles, As it is res certa Conteyned in Magna Charta. But maister Damyan, Or some other man, That clerkely is and can Well scrypture expounde And hys textes grounde, His benefyce worthe ten pounde, Or skante worth twenty marke, And yet a noble clerke, He must do this werke; As I knowe a parte, Some maisters of arte, Some doctours of lawe, Some lernde in other sawe, As in dyuynyte, That hath no dygnyte But the pore degre Of the vnyuersyte; Or els frere Frederycke, Or els frere Dominike, Or frere Hugulinus, Or frere Agustinus, Or frere Carmelus, That gostly can heale vs; Or els yf we may Get a frere graye, Or els of the order Vpon Grenewyche border, Called Obseruaunce, Or a frere of Fraunce; Or else the poore Scot, It must come to his lot To shote forthe his shot; Or of Babuell besyde Bery, To postell vpon a kyry, That wolde it shulde be noted Howe scripture shulde be coted, And so clerkley promoted; And yet the frere doted. But men sey your awtoryte, And your noble se, And your dygnyte, Shulde be imprynted better Then all the freres letter; For if ye wolde take payne To preche a worde or twayne, Though it were neuer so playne, With clauses two or thre, So as they myght be Compendyously conueyde, These wordes shuld be more weyd, And better perceyued, And thankfullerlye receyued, And better shulde remayne Amonge the people playne, That wold your wordes retayne And reherce them agayne, Than a thousand thousande other, That blaber, barke, and blother, And make a Walshmans hose Of the texte and of the glose. For protestatyon made, That I wyll not wade Farther in this broke, Nor farther for to loke In deuysynge of this boke, But answere that I may For my selfe alway, Eyther analogice Or els categorice, So that in diuinite Doctors that lerned be, Nor bachelers of that faculte That hath taken degre In the vniuersite, Shall not be obiecte at by me. But doctour Bullatus, Parum litteratus, Dominus doctoratus At the brode gatus, Doctour Daupatus, And bacheler bacheleratus, Dronken as a mouse, At the ale house, Taketh his pyllyon and his cap At the good ale tap, For lacke of good wyne; As wyse as Robyn swyne, Vnder a notaryes sygne Was made a dyuyne; As wyse as Waltoms calfe, Must preche, a Goddes halfe, In the pulpyt solempnely; More mete in the pyllory, For, by saynt Hyllary, He can nothyng smatter Of logyke nor scole matter, Neyther syllogisare, Nor enthymemare, Nor knoweth his elenkes, Nor his predicamens; And yet he wyll mell To amend the gospell, And wyll preche and tell What they do in hell; And he dare not well neuen What they do in heuen, Nor how farre Temple barre is From the seuen starrys. Nowe wyll I go And tell of other mo, Semper protestando De non impugnando The foure ordores of fryers, Though some of them be lyers; As Lymyters at large Wyll charge and dyscharge; As many a frere, God wote, Preches for his grote, Flatterynge for a newe cote And for to haue his fees; Some to gather chese; Loth they are to lese Eyther corne or malte; Somtyme meale and salte, Somtyme a bacon flycke, That is thre fyngers thycke Of larde and of greace, Theyr couent to encreace. I put you out of doute, This can not be brought aboute But they theyr tonges fyle, And make a plesaunt style To Margery and to Maude, Howe they haue no fraude; And somtyme they prouoke Bothe Gyll and Jacke at Noke Their dewtyes to withdrawe, That they ought by the lawe Theyr curates to content In open tyme and in Lent: God wot, they take great payne To flatter and to fayne; But it is an olde sayd sawe, That nede hath no lawe. Some walke aboute in melottes, In gray russet and heery cotes; Some wyl neyther golde ne grotes; Some plucke a partrych in remotes, And by the barres of her tayle Wyll knowe a rauen from a rayle, A quayle, the raile, and the olde rauen: Sed libera nos a malo! Amen. And by Dudum, theyr Clementine, Agaynst curates they repyne; And say propreli they ar sacerdotes, To shryue, assoyle, and reles Dame Margeries soule out of hell: But when the freare fell in the well, He coud not syng himselfe therout But by the helpe of Christyan Clout. Another Clementyne also, How frere Fabian, with other mo, Exivit de Paradiso; Whan they agayn theder shal come, De hoc petimus consilium: And through all the world they go With Dirige and Placebo. But nowe my mynd ye vnderstand, For they must take in hande To prech, and to withstande Al maner of abiections; For bysshops haue protections, They say, to do corrections, But they haue no affections To take the sayd dyrections; In such maner of cases, Men say, they bere no faces To occupye suche places, To sowe the sede of graces: Theyr hertes are so faynted, And they be so attaynted With coueytous and ambycyon, And other superstycyon, That they be deef and dum, And play scylens and glum, Can say nothynge but mum. They occupye them so With syngyng Placebo, They wyll no farther go: They had leuer to please, And take their worldly ease, Than to take on hande Worsshepfully to withstande Such temporall warre and bate, As nowe is made of late Agaynst holy Churche estate, Or to maynteyne good quarelles. The lay men call them barrelles Full of glotony And of hypocrysy, That counterfaytes and payntes As they were very sayntes: In matters that them lyke They shewe them polytyke, Pretendyng grauyte And sygnyoryte, With all solempnyte, For theyr indempnyte; For they wyll haue no losse Of a peny nor of a crosse Of theyr predyall landes, That cometh to theyr handes, And as farre as they dare set, All is fysshe that cometh to net: Buyldyng royally Theyr mancyons curyously, With turrettes and with toures, With halles and with boures, Stretchynge to the starres, With glasse wyndowes and barres; Hangynge aboute the walles Clothes of golde and palles, Arras of ryche aray, Fresshe as flours in May; Wyth dame Dyana naked; Howe lusty Venus quaked, And howe Cupyde shaked His darte, and bent his bowe For to shote a crowe At her tyrly tyrlowe; And howe Parys of Troy Daunced a lege de moy, Made lusty sporte and ioy With dame Helyn the quene; With suche storyes bydene Their chambres well besene; With triumphes of Cesar, And of Pompeyus war, Of renowne and of fame By them to get a name: Nowe all the worlde stares, How they ryde in goodly chares, Conueyed by olyphantes, With lauryat garlantes, And by vnycornes With their semely hornes; Vpon these beestes rydynge, Naked boyes strydynge, With wanton wenches winkyng. Nowe truly, to my thynkynge, That is a speculacyon And a mete meditacyon For prelates of estate, Their courage to abate From worldly wantonnesse, Theyr chambres thus to dresse With suche parfetnesse And all suche holynesse; How be it they let downe fall Their churches cathedrall. Squyre, knyght, and lorde, Thus the Churche remorde; With all temporall people They rune agaynst the steple, Thus talkynge and tellyng How some of you are mellyng; Yet softe and fayre for swellyng, Beware of a quenes yellyng. It is a besy thyng For one man to rule a kyng Alone and make rekenyng, To gouerne ouer all And rule a realme royall By one mannes verrey wyt; Fortune may chaunce to flyt, And whan he weneth to syt, Yet may he mysse the quysshon: For I rede a preposycyon, Cum regibus amicare, Et omnibus dominari, Et supra te pravare; Wherfore he hathe good vre That can hymselfe assure Howe fortune wyll endure. Than let reason you supporte, For the communalte dothe reporte That they haue great wonder That ye kepe them so vnder; Yet they meruayle so moche lesse, For ye play so at the chesse, As they suppose and gesse, That some of you but late Hath played so checkemate With lordes of great estate, After suche a rate, That they shall mell nor make, Nor vpon them take, For kynge nor kayser sake, But at the playsure of one That ruleth the roste alone. Helas, I say, helas! Howe may this come to passe, That a man shall here a masse, And not so hardy on his hede To loke on God in forme of brede, But that the parysshe clerke There vpon must herke, And graunt hym at his askyng For to se the sacryng? And howe may this accorde, No man to our souerayne lorde So hardy to make sute, Nor yet to execute His commaundement, Without the assent Of our presydent, Nor to expresse to his person, Without your consentatyon Graunt hym his lycence To preas to his presence, Nor to speke to hym secretly, Openly nor preuyly, Without his presydent be by, Or els his substytute Whom he wyll depute? Neyther erle ne duke Permytted? by saynt Luke, And by swete saynt Marke, This is a wonderous warke! That the people talke this, Somewhat there is amysse: The deuil cannot stop their mouthes, But they wyl talke of such vncouthes, All that euer they ken Agaynst all spirituall men. Whether it be wrong or ryght, Or els for dyspyght, Or howe euer it hap, Theyr tonges thus do clap, And through suche detractyon They put you to your actyon; And whether they say trewly As they may abyde therby, Or els that they do lye, Ye knowe better then I. But nowe debetis scire, And groundly audire, In your convenire, Of this premenire, Or els in the myre They saye they wyll you cast; Therfore stande sure and fast. Stande sure, and take good fotyng, And let be all your motyng, Your gasyng and your totyng, And your parcyall promotyng Of those that stande in your grace; But olde seruauntes ye chase, And put them out of theyr place. Make ye no murmuracyon, Though I wryte after this facion; Though I, Colyn Cloute, Among the hole route Of you that clerkes be, Take nowe vpon me Thus copyously to wryte, I do it for no despyte. Wherfore take no dysdayne At my style rude and playne; For I rebuke no man That vertuous is: why than Wreke ye your anger on me? For those that vertuous be Haue no cause to say That I speke out of the way. Of no good bysshop, speke I, Nor good preest I escrye, Good frere, nor good chanon, Good nonne, nor good canon, Good monke, nor good clercke, Nor yette of no good werke: But my recountyng is Of them that do amys, In speking and rebellyng, In hynderyng and dysauaylyng Holy Churche, our mother, One agaynst another; To vse suche despytyng Is all my hole wrytyng; To hynder no man, As nere as I can, For no man haue I named: Wherfore sholde I be blamed? Ye ought to be ashamed, Agaynst me to be gramed, And can tell no cause why, But that I wryte trewly. Then yf any there be Of hygh or lowe degre Of the spiritualte, Or of the temporalte, That dothe thynke or wene That his conscyence be not clene, And feleth hymselfe sycke, Or touched on the quycke, Suche grace God them sende Themselfe to amende, For I wyll not pretende Any man to offende. Wherfore, as thynketh me, Great ydeottes they be, And lytell grace they haue, This treatyse to depraue; Nor wyll here no prechyng, Nor no vertuous techyng, Nor wyll haue no resytyng Of any vertuous wrytyng; Wyll knowe none intellygence To refourme theyr neglygence, But lyue styll out of facyon, To theyr owne dampnacyon. To do shame they haue no shame, But they wold no man shulde them blame: They haue an euyl name, But yet they wyll occupy the same. With them the worde of God Is counted for no rod; They counte it for a raylyng, That nothyng is auaylyng; The prechers with euyll hayling: Shall they daunt vs prelates, That be theyr prymates? Not so hardy on theyr pates! Herke, howe the losell prates, With a wyde wesaunt! Auaunt, syr Guy of Gaunt! Auaunt, lewde preest, auaunt! Auaunt, syr doctour Deuyas! Prate of thy matyns and thy masse, And let our maters passe: Howe darest thou, daucocke, mell? Howe darest thou, losell, Allygate the gospell Agaynst vs of the counsell? Auaunt to the deuyll of hell! Take hym, wardeyne of the Flete, Set hym fast by the fete! I say, lyeutenaunt of the Toure, Make this lurdeyne for to loure; Lodge hym in Lytell Ease, Fede hym with beanes and pease! The Kynges Benche or Marshalsy, Haue hym thyder by and by! The vyllayne precheth openly, And declareth our vyllany; And of our fre symplenesse He sayes that we are rechelesse, And full of wylfulnesse, Shameles and mercylesse, Incorrigible and insaciate; And after this rate Agaynst vs dothe prate. At Poules Crosse or els where, Openly at Westmynstere, And Saynt Mary Spyttell, They set not by vs a whystell: At the Austen fryers They count vs for lyers: And at Saynt Thomas of Akers They carpe vs lyke crakers, Howe we wyll rule all at wyll Without good reason or skyll; And say how that we be Full of parcyalyte; And howe at a pronge We tourne ryght into wronge, Delay causes so longe That ryght no man can fonge; They say many matters be born By the ryght of a rambes horne. Is not this a shamfull scorne, To be teared thus and torne How may we thys indure? Wherfore we make you sure, Ye prechers shall be yawde; And some shall be sawde, As noble Isaias, The holy prophet, was; And some of you shall dye, Lyke holy Jeremy; Some hanged, some slayne, Some beaten to the brayne; And we wyll rule and rayne, And our matters mayntayne Who dare say there agayne, Or who dare dysdayne At our pleasure and wyll: For, be it good or be it yll, As it is, it shall be styll, For all master doctour of Cyuyll, Or of Diuine, or doctour Dryuyll, Let hym cough, rough, or sneuyll; Renne God, renne deuyll, Renne who may renne best, And let take all the rest! We set not a nut shell The way to heuen or to hell. Lo, this is the gyse now a dayes! It is to drede, men sayes, Lest they be Saduces, As they be sayd sayne Whiche determyned playne We shulde not ryse agayne At dredefull domis day; And so it semeth they play, Whiche hate to be corrected Whan they be infected, Nor wyll suffre this boke By hoke ne by croke Prynted for to be, For that no man shulde se Nor rede in any scrolles Of theyr dronken nolles, Nor of theyr noddy polles, Nor of theyr sely soules, Nor of some wytles pates Of dyuers great estates, As well as other men. Now to withdrawe my pen, And now a whyle to rest, Me semeth it for the best. The forecastell of my shyp Shall glyde, and smothely slyp Out of the wawes wod Of the stormy flod; Shote anker, and lye at rode, And sayle not farre abrode, Tyll the cost be clere, And the lode starre appere: My shyp nowe wyll I stere Towarde the porte salu Of our Sauyour Jesu, Suche grace that he vs sende, To rectyfye and amende Thynges that are amys, Whan that his pleasure is. Amen! In opere imperfecto, In opere semper perfecto, Et in opere plusquam perfecto! A RYGHT DELECTABLE TRATYSE VPON A GOODLY GARLANDE OR CHAPELET OF LAURELL, BY MAYSTER SKELTON, POETE LAUREAT, STUDYOUSLY DYUYSED AT SHERYFHOTTON CASTELL, IN THE FORESTE OF GALTRES, WHEREIN AR COMPRYSYDE MANY AND DYUERS SOLACYONS AND RYGHT PREGNANT ALLECTYUES OF SYNGULAR PLEASURE, AS MORE AT LARGE IT DOTH APERE IN THE PROCES FOLOWYNGE. Eterno mansura die dum sidera fulgent, Æquora dumque tument, hæc laurea nostra virebit: Hinc nostrum celebre et nomen referetur ad astra, Undique Skeltonis memorabitur alter Adonis. Arectyng my syght towarde the zodyake, The sygnes xii for to beholde a farre, When Mars retrogradant reuersyd his bak, Lorde of the yere in his orbicular, Put vp his sworde, for he cowde make no warre, And whan Lucina plenarly did shyne, Scorpione ascendynge degrees twyse nyne; In place alone then musynge in my thought How all thynge passyth as doth the somer flower, On euery halfe my reasons forthe I sought, How oftyn fortune varyeth in an howre, Now clere wether, forthwith a stormy showre; All thynge compassyd, no perpetuyte, But now in welthe, now in aduersyte. So depely drownyd I was in this dumpe, Encraumpysshed so sore was my conceyte, That, me to rest, I lent me to a stumpe Of an oke, that somtyme grew full streyghte, A myghty tre and of a noble heyght, Whose bewte blastyd was with the boystors wynde, His leuis loste, the sappe was frome the rynde. Thus stode I in the frytthy forest of Galtres, Ensowkid with sylt of the myry mose, Where hartis belluyng, embosyd with distres, Ran on the raunge so longe, that I suppose Few men can tell now where the hynde calfe gose; Faire fall that forster that so well can bate his hownde! But of my purpose now torne we to the grownde. Whylis I stode musynge in this medytatyon, In slumbrynge I fell and halfe in a slepe; And whether it were of ymagynacyon, Or of humors superflue, that often wyll crepe Into the brayne by drynkyng ouer depe, Or it procedyd of fatall persuacyon, I can not wele tell you what was the occasyon; But sodeynly at ones, as I me aduysed, As one in a trans or in an extasy, I sawe a pauylyon wondersly disgysede, Garnysshed fresshe after my fantasy, Enhachyde with perle and stones preciously, The grounde engrosyd and bet with bourne golde, That passynge goodly it was to beholde: Within it, a prynces excellente of porte; But to recount her ryche abylyment, And what estates to her did resorte, Therto am I full insuffycyent; A goddesse inmortall she dyd represente; As I harde say, dame Pallas was her name; To whome supplyed the royall Quene of Fame. The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas. Prynces moost pusant, of hygh preemynence, Renownyd lady aboue the sterry heuyn, All other transcendyng, of very congruence Madame regent of the scyence seuyn, To whos astate all noblenes most lenen, My supplycacyon to you I arrect, Whereof I beseche you to tender the effecte. Not vnremembered it is vnto your grace, How you gaue me a ryall commaundement That in my courte Skelton shulde haue a place, Bycause that his tyme he studyously hath spent In your seruyce; and, to the accomplysshement Of your request, regestred is his name With laureate tryumphe in the courte of Fame. But, good madame, the accustome and vsage Of auncient poetis, ye wote full wele, hath bene Them selfe to embesy with all there holl corage, So that there workis myght famously be sene, In figure wherof they were the laurell grene; But how it is, Skelton is wonder slake, And, as we dare, we fynde in hym grete lake: For, ne were onely he hath your promocyon, Out of my bokis full sone I shulde hym rase; But sith he hath tastid of the sugred pocioun Of Elyconis well, refresshid with your grace, And wyll not endeuour hymselfe to purchase The fauour of ladys with wordis electe, It is sittynge that ye must hym correct. Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame. The sum of your purpose, as we ar aduysid, Is that our seruaunt is sum what to dull; Wherin this answere for hym we haue comprisid, How ryuers rin not tyll the spryng be full; Better a dum mouthe than a brainles scull; For if he gloryously pullishe his matter, Then men wyll say how he doth but flatter; And if so hym fortune to wryte true and plaine, As sumtyme he must vyces remorde, Then sum wyll say he hath but lyttill brayne, And how his wordes with reason wyll not accorde; Beware, for wrytyng remayneth of recorde; Displease not an hundreth for one mannes pleasure; Who wryteth wysely hath a grete treasure. Also, to furnisshe better his excuse, Ouyde was bannisshed for suche a skyll, And many mo whome I cowde enduce; Iuuenall was thret parde for to kyll For certayne enuectyfys, yet wrote he none ill, Sauynge he rubbid sum vpon the gall; It was not for hym to abyde the tryall. In generrall wordes, I say not gretely nay, A poete somtyme may for his pleasure taunt, Spekyng in parablis, how the fox, the grey, The gander, the gose, and the hudge oliphaunt, Went with the pecok ageyne the fesaunt; The lesarde came lepyng, and sayd that he must, With helpe of the ram, ley all in the dust. Yet dyuerse ther be, industryous of reason, Sum what wolde gadder in there coniecture Of suche an endarkid chapiter sum season; How be it, it were harde to construe this lecture; Sophisticatid craftely is many a confecture; Another manes mynde diffuse is to expounde; Yet harde is to make but sum fawt be founde. The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas. Madame, with fauour of your benynge sufferaunce, Vnto your grace then make I this motyue; Whereto made ye me hym to auaunce Vnto the rowme of laureat promotyue? Or wherto shulde he haue that prerogatyue, But if he had made sum memoryall, Wherby he myght haue a name inmortall? To pas the tyme in slowthfull ydelnes, Of your royall palace it is not the gyse, But to do sumwhat iche man doth hym dres: For how shulde Cato els be callyd wyse, But that his bokis, whiche he did deuyse, Recorde the same? or why is had in mynde Plato, but for that he left wrytynge behynde, For men to loke on? Aristotille also, Of phylosophers callid the princypall, Olde Diogenes, with other many mo, Demostenes, that oratour royall, That gaue Eschines suche a cordyall. That bannisshed was he by his proposicyoun, Ageyne whome he cowde make no contradicyoun? Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame. Soft, my good syster, and make there a pawse: And was Eschines rebukid as ye say? Remembre you wele, poynt wele that clause; Wherfore then rasid ye not away His name? or why is it, I you praye, That he to your courte is goyng and commynge, Sith he is slaundred for defaut of konnyng? The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas. Madame, your apposelle is wele inferrid, And at your auauntage quikly it is Towchid, and hard for to be debarrid; Yet shall I answere your grace as in this, With your reformacion, if I say amis, For, but if your bounte did me assure, Myne argument els koude not longe endure. As towchyng that Eschines is remembred, That he so sholde be, me semith it sittyng, All be it grete parte he hath surrendred Of his onour, whos dissuasyue in wrytyng To corage Demostenes was moche excitynge, In settyng out fresshely his crafty persuacyon, From whiche Eschines had none euacyon. The cause why Demostenes so famously is brutid, Onely procedid for that he did outray Eschines, whiche was not shamefully confutid But of that famous oratour, I say, Whiche passid all other; wherfore I may Among my recordes suffer hym namyd, For though he were venquesshid, yet was he not shamyd: As Ierome, in his preamble Frater Ambrosius, Frome that I haue sayde in no poynt doth vary, Wherein he reporteth of the coragius Wordes that were moch consolatory By Eschines rehersed to the grete glory Of Demostenes, that was his vtter foo: Few shall ye fynde or none that wyll do so. Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame. A thanke to haue, ye haue well deseruyd, Your mynde that can maynteyne so apparently; But a grete parte yet ye haue reseruyd Of that most folow then conseqently, Or els ye demeane you inordinatly; For if ye laude hym whome honour hath opprest, Then he that doth worste is as good as the best. But whome that ye fauoure, I se well, hath a name, Be he neuer so lytell of substaunce, And whome ye loue not ye wyll put to shame; Ye counterwey not euynly your balaunce; As wele foly as wysdome oft ye do avaunce: For reporte ryseth many deuerse wayes: Sume be moche spokyn of for makynge of frays; Some haue a name for thefte and brybery; Some be called crafty, that can pyke a purse; Some men be made of for their mokery; Some carefull cokwoldes, some haue theyr wyues curs; Some famous wetewoldis, and they be moche wurs; Some lidderons, some losels, some noughty packis; Some facers, some bracers, some make great crackis; Some dronken dastardis with their dry soules; Some sluggyssh slouyns, that slepe day and nyght; Ryot and Reuell be in your courte rowlis; Maintenaunce and Mischefe, theis be men of myght; Extorcyon is counted with you for a knyght; Theis people by me haue none assignement, Yet they ryde and rinne from Carlyll to Kente. But lytell or nothynge ye shall here tell Of them that haue vertue by reason of cunnyng, Whiche souerenly in honoure shulde excell; Men of suche maters make but a mummynge, For wysdome and sadnesse be set out a sunnyng; And suche of my seruauntes as I haue promotyd, One faute or other in them shalbe notyd: Eyther they wyll say he is to wyse, Or elles he can nought bot whan he is at scole; Proue his wytt, sayth he, at cardes or dyce, And ye shall well fynde he is a very fole; Twyshe, set hym a chare, or reche hym a stole, To syt hym vpon, and rede Iacke a thrummis bybille, For truly it were pyte that he sat ydle. The Quene of Fame to Dame Pallas. To make repungnaunce agayne that ye haue sayde, Of very dwte it may not well accorde, But your benynge sufferaunce for my discharge I laid, For that I wolde not with you fall at discorde; But yet I beseche your grace that good recorde May be brought forth, suche as can be founde, With laureat tryumphe why Skelton sholde be crownde; For elles it were to great a derogacyon Vnto your palas, our noble courte of Fame, That any man vnder supportacyon Withoute deseruynge shulde haue the best game: If he to the ample encrease of his name Can lay any werkis that he hath compylyd, I am contente that he be not exylide Frome the laureat senate by force of proscripcyon; Or elles, ye know well, I can do no lesse But I must bannysshe hym frome my iurydiccyon, As he that aquentyth hym with ydilnes; But if that he purpose to make a redresse, What he hath done, let it be brought to syght; Graunt my petycyon, I aske you but ryght. Dame Pallas to the Quene of Fame. To your request we be well condiscendid: Call forthe, let se where is your clarionar, To blowe a blaste with his long breth extendid; Eolus, your trumpet, that knowne is so farre, That bararag blowyth in euery mercyall warre, Let hym blowe now, that we may take a vewe What poetis we haue at our retenewe; To se if Skelton wyll put hymselfe in prease Amonge the thickeste of all the hole rowte; Make noyse enoughe, for claterars loue no peas; Let se, my syster, now spede you, go aboute; Anone, I sey, this trumpet were founde out, And for no man hardely let hym spare To blowe bararag tyll bothe his eyne stare. Skelton Poeta. Forthwith there rose amonge the thronge A wonderfull noyse, and on euery syde They presid in faste; some thought they were to longe; Sume were to hasty, and wold no man byde; Some whispred, some rownyd, some spake, and some cryde, With heuynge and shouynge, haue in and haue oute; Some ranne the nexte way, sume ranne abowte. There was suyng to the Quene of Fame; He plucked hym backe, and he went afore; Nay, holde thy tunge, quod another, let me haue the name; Make rowme, sayd another, ye prese all to sore; Sume sayd, Holde thy peas, thou getest here no more; A thowsande thowsande I sawe on a plumpe: With that I harde the noyse of a trumpe, That longe tyme blewe a full timorous blaste, Lyke to the boryall wyndes whan they blowe, That towres and townes and trees downe caste, Droue clowdes together lyke dryftis of snowe; The dredefull dinne droue all the rowte on a rowe; Some tremblid, some girnid, some gaspid, some gasid, As people halfe peuysshe, or men that were masyd. Anone all was whyste, as it were for the nonys, And iche man stode gasyng and staryng vpon other: With that there come in wonderly at ones A murmur of mynstrels, that suche another Had I neuer sene, some softer, some lowder; Orpheus, the Traciane, herped meledyously Weth Amphion, and other Musis of Archady: Whos heuenly armony was so passynge sure, So truely proporsionyd, and so well did gree, So duly entunyd with euery mesure, That in the forest was none so great a tre But that he daunced for ioye of that gle; The huge myghty okes them selfe dyd auaunce, And lepe frome the hylles to lerne for to daunce: In so moche the stumpe, whereto I me lente, Sterte all at ones an hundrethe fote backe: With that I sprange vp towarde the tent Of noble Dame Pallas, wherof I spake; Where I sawe come after, I wote, full lytell lake Of a thousande poetes assembled togeder: But Phebus was formest of all that cam theder; Of laurell leuis a cronell on his hede, With heris encrisped yalowe as the golde, Lamentyng Daphnes, whome with the darte of lede Cupyde hath stryken so that she ne wolde Concente to Phebus to haue his herte in holde, But, for to preserue her maidenhode clene, Transformyd was she into the laurell grene. Meddelyd with murnynge the moost parte of his muse, O thoughtfull herte, was euermore his songe! Daphnes, my derlynge, why do you me refuse? Yet loke on me, that louyd you haue so longe, Yet haue compassyon vpon my paynes stronge: He sange also how, the tre as he did take Betwene his armes, he felt her body quake. Then he assurded into this exclamacyon Vnto Diana, the goddes inmortall; O mercyles madame, hard is your constellacyon, So close to kepe your cloyster virgynall, Enhardid adyment the sement of your wall! Alas, what ayle you to be so ouerthwhart, To bannysshe pyte out of a maydens harte? Why haue the goddes shewyd me this cruelte, Sith I contryuyd first princyples medycynable? I helpe all other of there infirmite, But now to helpe myselfe I am not able; That profyteth all other is nothynge profytable Vnto me; alas, that herbe nor gresse The feruent axes of loue can not represse! O fatall fortune, what haue I offendid? Odious disdayne, why raist thou me on this facyon? But sith I haue lost now that I entended, And may not atteyne it by no medyacyon, Yet, in remembraunce of Daphnes transformacyon, All famous poetis ensuynge after me Shall were a garlande of the laurell tre. This sayd, a grate nowmber folowyd by and by Of poetis laureat of many dyuerse nacyons; Parte of there names I thynke to specefye: Fyrste, olde Quintiliane with his Declamacyons; Theocritus with his bucolycall relacyons; Esiodus, the iconomicar, And Homerus, the fresshe historiar; Prynce of eloquence, Tullius Cicero, With Salusty ageinst Lucius Catelyne, That wrote the history of Iugurta also; Ouyde, enshryned with the Musis nyne; But blessed Bacchus, the pleasant god of wyne, Of closters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis These orators and poetes refresshed there throtis; Lucan, with Stacius in Achilliedos; Percius presed forth with problemes diffuse; Virgill the Mantuan, with his Eneidos; Iuuenall satirray, that men makythe to muse; But blessed Bacchus, the pleasant god of wyne, Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotes These orators and poetes refreshed their throtes; There Titus Lyuius hymselfe dyd auaunce With decadis historious, whiche that he mengith With maters that amount the Romayns in substaunce; Enyus, that wrate of mercyall war at lengthe; But blessyd Bachus, potenciall god of strengthe, Of clusters engrosid with his ruddy flotis Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis; Aulus Gelius, that noble historiar; Orace also with his new poetry; Mayster Terence, the famous comicar, With Plautus, that wrote full many a comody; But blessyd Bachus was in there company, Of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis; Senek full soberly with his tragediis; Boyce, recounfortyd with his philosophy; And Maxymyane, with his madde ditiis, How dotynge age wolde iape with yonge foly; But blessyd Bachus most reuerent and holy, Of clusters engrosid with his ruddy flotis Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis; There came Johnn Bochas with his volumys grete; Quintus Cursius, full craftely that wrate Of Alexander; and Macrobius that did trete Of Scipions dreme what was the treu probate; But blessyd Bachus that neuer man forgate, Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotis These orators and poetis refresshid ther throtis; Poggeus also, that famous Florentine, Mustred ther amonge them with many a mad tale; With a frere of Fraunce men call sir Gagwyne, That frownyd on me full angerly and pale; But blessyd Bachus, that bote is of all bale, Of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis Theis orators and poetis refresshid there throtis; Plutarke and Petrarke, two famous clarkis; Lucilius and Valerius Maximus by name; With Vincencius in Speculo, that wrote noble warkis; Propercius and Pisandros, poetis of noble fame; But blissed Bachus, that mastris oft doth frame, Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotis Theis notable poetis refresshid there throtis. And as I thus sadly amonge them auysid, I saw Gower, that first garnisshed our Englysshe rude, And maister Chaucer, that nobly enterprysyd How that our Englysshe myght fresshely be ennewed; The monke of Bury then after them ensuyd, Dane Johnn Lydgate: theis Englysshe poetis thre, As I ymagenyd, repayrid vnto me, Togeder in armes, as brethern, enbrasid; There apparell farre passynge beyonde that I can tell; With diamauntis and rubis there tabers were trasid, None so ryche stones in Turkey to sell; Thei wantid nothynge but the laurell; And of there bounte they made me godely chere, In maner and forme as ye shall after here. Mayster Gower to Skelton. Brother Skelton, your endeuorment So haue ye done, that meretoryously Ye haue deseruyd to haue an enplement In our collage aboue the sterry sky, Bycause that ye encrese and amplyfy The brutid Britons of Brutus Albion, That welny was loste when that we were gone. Poeta Skelton to Maister Gower. Maister Gower, I haue nothyng deserued To haue so laudabyle a commendacion: To yow thre this honor shalbe reserued, Arrectinge vnto your wyse examinacion How all that I do is vnder refformation, For only the substance of that I entend, Is glad to please, and loth to offend. Mayster Chaucer to Skelton. Counterwayng your besy delygence Of that we beganne in the supplement, Enforcid ar we you to recompence, Of all our hooll collage by the agreament, That we shall brynge you personally present Of noble Fame before the Quenes grace, In whose court poynted is your place. Poeta Skelton answeryth. O noble Chaucer, whos pullisshyd eloquence Oure Englysshe rude so fresshely hath set out, That bounde ar we with all deu reuerence, With all our strength that we can brynge about, To owe to yow our seruyce, and more if we mowte! But what sholde I say? ye wote what I entende, Whiche glad am to please, and loth to offende. Mayster Lydgate to Skelton. So am I preuentid of my brethern tweyne In rendrynge to you thankkis meritory, That welny nothynge there doth remayne Wherwith to geue you my regraciatory, But that I poynt you to be prothonatory Of Fames court, by all our holl assent Auaunced by Pallas to laurell preferment. Poeta Skelton answeryth. So haue ye me far passynge my meretis extollyd, Mayster Lidgate, of your accustomable Bownte, and so gloryously ye haue enrollyd My name, I know well, beyonde that I am able, That but if my warkes therto be agreable, I am elles rebukyd of that I intende, Which glad am to please, and lothe to offende. So finally, when they had shewyd there deuyse, Vnder the forme as I sayd tofore, I made it straunge, and drew bak ones or twyse, And euer they presed on me more and more, Tyll at the last they forcyd me so sore, That with them I went where they wolde me brynge, Vnto the pauylyon where Pallas was syttyng. Dame Pallas commaundid that they shold me conuay Into the ryche palace of the Quene of Fame; There shal he here what she wyl to hym say When he is callid to answere to his name: A cry anone forthwith she made proclame, All orators and poetis shulde thider go before, With all the prese that there was, lesse and more. Forthwith, I say, thus wandrynge in my thought, How it was, or elles within what howris, I can not tell you, but that I was brought Into a palace with turrettis and towris, Engolerid goodly with hallis and bowris, So curiously, so craftely, so connyngly wrowght, That all the worlde, I trowe, and it were sought, Suche an other there coude no man fynde; Wherof partely I purpose to expounde, Whyles it remanyth fresshe in my mynde. With turkis and grossolitis enpauyd was the grounde; Of birrall enbosid wer the pyllers rownde; Of elephantis tethe were the palace gatis, Enlosenged with many goodly platis Of golde, entachid with many a precyous stone; An hundred steppis mountyng to the halle, One of iasper, another of whalis bone; Of dyamauntis pointed was the rokky wall; The carpettis within and tappettis of pall; The chambres hangid with clothes of arace; Enuawtyd with rubies the vawte was of this place. Thus passid we forth, walkynge vnto the pretory, Where the postis wer enbulyoned with saphiris indy blew, Englasid glittering with many a clere story; Iacinctis and smaragdis out of the florthe they grew: Vnto this place all poetis there did sue, Wherin was set of Fame the noble Quene, All other transcendynge, most rychely besene, Vnder a gloryous cloth of astate, Fret all with orient perlys of Garnate, Encrownyd as empresse of all this worldly fate, So ryally, so rychely, so passyngly ornate, It was excedyng byyonde the commowne rate: This hous enuyrowne was a myle about; If xii were let in, xii hundreth stode without. Then to this lady and souerayne of this palace Of purseuantis ther presid in with many a dyuerse tale; Some were of Poyle, and sum were of Trace, Of Lymerik, of Loreine, of Spayne, of Portyngale, Frome Napuls, from Nauern, and from Rounceuall, Some from Flaunders, sum fro the se coste, Some from the mayne lande, some fro the Frensche hoste: With, How doth the north? what tydyngis in the sowth? The west is wyndy, the est is metely wele; It is harde to tell of euery mannes mouthe; A slipper holde the taile is of an ele, And he haltith often that hath a kyby hele; Some shewid his salfecundight, some shewid his charter, Some lokyd full smothely, and had a fals quarter; With, Sir, I pray you, a lytyll tyne stande backe, And lette me come in to delyuer my lettre; Another tolde how shyppes wente to wrak; There were many wordes smaller and gretter, With, I as good as thou, Ifayth and no better; Some came to tell treuth, some came to lye, Some came to flater, some came to spye: There were, I say, of all maner of sortis, Of Dertmouth, of Plummouth, of Portismouth also; The burgeis and the ballyuis of the v portis, With, Now let me come, and now let me go: And all tyme wandred I thus to and fro, Tyll at the last theis noble poetis thre Vnto me sayd, Lo, syr, now ye may se Of this high courte the dayly besines; From you most we, but not longe to tary; Lo, hither commyth a goodly maystres, Occupacyon, Famys regestary, Whiche shall be to you a sufferayne accessary, With syngular pleasurs to dryue away the tyme, And we shall se you ageyne or it be pryme. When they were past and wente forth on there way, This gentilwoman, that callyd was by name Occupacyon, in ryght goodly aray, Came towarde me, and smylid halfe in game; I sawe hir smyle, and I then did the same; With that on me she kest her goodly loke; Vnder her arme, me thought, she hade a boke. Occupacyoun to Skelton. Lyke as the larke, vpon the somers day, Whan Titan radiant burnisshith his bemis bryght, Mountith on hy with her melodious lay, Of the soneshyne engladid with the lyght, So am I supprysed with pleasure and delyght To se this howre now, that I may say, How ye ar welcome to this court of aray. Of your aqueintaunce I was in tymes past, Of studyous doctryne when at the port salu Ye fyrste aryuyd; whan broken was your mast Of worldly trust, then did I you rescu; Your storme dryuen shyppe I repared new, So well entakeled, what wynde that euer blowe, No stormy tempeste your barge shall ouerthrow. Welcome to me as hertely as herte can thynke, Welcome to me with all my hole desyre! And for my sake spare neyther pen nor ynke; Be well assurid I shall aquyte your hyre, Your name recountynge beyonde the lande of Tyre, From Sydony to the mount Olympyan, Frome Babill towre to the hillis Caspian. Skelton Poeta answeryth. I thanked her moche of her most noble offer, Affyaunsynge her myne hole assuraunce For her pleasure to make a large profer, Enpryntyng her wordes in my remembraunce, To owe her my seruyce with true perseueraunce. Come on with me, she sayd, let vs not stonde; And with that worde she toke me by the honde. So passyd we forthe into the forsayd place, With suche communycacyon as came to our mynde; And then she sayd, Whylis we haue tyme and space To walke where we lyst, let vs somwhat fynde To pas the tyme with, but let vs wast no wynde, For ydle iangelers haue but lytill braine; Wordes be swordes, and hard to call ageine. Into a felde she brought me wyde and large, Enwallyd aboute with the stony flint, Strongly enbateld, moche costious of charge: To walke on this walle she bed I sholde not stint; Go softly, she sayd, the stones be full glint. She went before, and bad me take good holde: I sawe a thowsande yatis new and olde, Then questionyd I her what thos yatis ment; Wherto she answeryd, and breuely me tolde, How from the est vnto the occident, And from the sowth vnto the north so colde, Theis yatis, she sayd, which that ye beholde, Be issuis and portis from all maner of nacyons; And seryously she shewyd me ther denominacyons. They had wrytyng, sum Greke, sum Ebrew, Some Romaine letters, as I vnderstode; Some were olde wryten, sum were writen new, Some carectis of Caldy, sum Frensshe was full good; But one gate specyally, where as I stode, Had grauin in it of calcydony a capytall A; What yate call ye this? and she sayd, Anglia. The beldynge therof was passynge commendable; Wheron stode a lybbard, crownyd with golde and stones, Terrible of countenaunce and passynge formydable, As quikly towchyd as it were flesshe and bones, As gastly that glaris, as grimly that gronis, As fersly frownynge as he had ben fyghtyng, And with his forme foote he shoke forthe this wrytyng: Formidanda nimis Jovis ultima fulmina tollis: Unguibus ire parat loca singula livida curvis Quam modo per Phœbes nummos raptura Celæno; Arma, lues, luctus, fel, vis, fraus, barbara tellus; Mille modis erras odium tibi quærere Martis: Spreto spineto cedat saliunca roseto. Then I me lent, and loked ouer the wall: Innumerable people presed to euery gate; Shet were the gatis; thei might wel knock and cal, And turne home ageyne, for they cam al to late. I her demaunded of them and ther astate: Forsothe, quod she, theys be haskardis and rebawdis, Dysers, carders, tumblars with gambawdis, Furdrers of loue, with baudry aqueinted, Brainles blenkardis that blow at the cole, Fals forgers of mony, for kownnage atteintid, Pope holy ypocrytis, as they were golde and hole, Powle hatchettis, that prate wyll at euery ale pole, Ryot, reueler, railer, brybery, theft, With other condycyons that well myght be left: Sume fayne themselfe folys, and wolde be callyd wyse, Sum medelynge spyes, by craft to grope thy mynde, Sum dysdanous dawcokkis that all men dispyse, Fals flaterers that fawne thé, and kurris of kynde That speke fayre before thé and shrewdly behynde; Hither they come crowdyng to get them a name, But hailid they be homwarde with sorow and shame. With that I herd gunnis russhe out at ones, Bowns, bowns, bowns! that all they out cryde: It made sum lympe legged and broisid there bones; Sum were made peuysshe, porisshly, pynk iyde, That euer more after by it they were aspyid; And one ther was there, I wondred of his hap, For a gun stone, I say, had all to-iaggid his cap, Raggid, and daggid, and cunnyngly cut; The blaste of the brynston blew away his brayne; Masid as a marche hare, he ran lyke a scut; And, sir, amonge all me thought I saw twaine, The one was a tumblar, that afterwarde againe Of a dysour, a deuyl way, grew a ientilman, Pers Prater, the secund, that quarillis beganne; With a pellit of peuisshenes they had suche a stroke, That all the dayes of ther lyfe shall styck by ther rybbis: Foo, foisty bawdias! sum smellid of the smoke; I saw dyuers that were cariid away thens in cribbis, Dasyng after dotrellis, lyke drunkardis that dribbis; Theis titiuyllis with taumpinnis wer towchid and tappid; Moche mischefe, I hyght you, amonge theem ther happid. Sometyme, as it semyth, when the mone light By meanys of a grosely endarkyd clowde Sodenly is eclipsid in the wynter night, In lyke maner of wyse a myst did vs shrowde; But wele may ye thynk I was no thyng prowde Of that auenturis, whiche made me sore agast. In derkenes thus dwelt we, tyll at the last The clowdis gan to clere, the myst was rarifiid: In an herber I saw, brought where I was, There birdis on the brere sange on euery syde; With alys ensandid about in compas, The bankis enturfid with singular solas, Enrailid with rosers, and vinis engrapid; It was a new comfort of sorowis escapid. In the middis a coundight, that coryously was cast, With pypes of golde engusshing out stremes; Of cristall the clerenes theis waters far past, Enswymmyng with rochis, barbellis, and bremis, Whose skales ensilured again the son beames Englisterd, that ioyous it was to beholde. Then furthermore aboute me my syght I reuolde, Where I saw growyng a goodly laurell tre, Enuerdurid with leuis contynually grene; Aboue in the top a byrde of Araby, Men call a phenix; her wynges bytwene She bet vp a fyre with the sparkis full kene With braunches and bowghis of the swete olyue, Whos flagraunt flower was chefe preseruatyue Ageynst all infeccyons with cancour enflamyd, Ageynst all baratows broisiours of olde, It passid all bawmys that euer were namyd, Or gummis of Saby so derely that be solde: There blew in that gardynge a soft piplyng colde Enbrethyng of Zepherus with his pleasant wynde; All frutis and flowris grew there in there kynde. Dryades there daunsid vpon that goodly soile, With the nyne Muses, Pierides by name; Phillis and Testalis, ther tressis with oyle Were newly enbybid; and rownd about the same Grene tre of laurell moche solacyous game They made, with chapellettes and garlandes grene; And formest of all dame Flora, the quene Of somer, so formally she fotid the daunce; There Cintheus sat twynklyng vpon his harpe stringis; And Iopas his instrument did auaunce, The poemis and storis auncient inbryngis Of Athlas astrology, and many noble thyngis, Of wandryng of the mone, the course of the sun, Of men and of bestis, and whereof they begone, What thynge occasionyd the showris of rayne, Of fyre elementar in his supreme spere, And of that pole artike whiche doth remayne Behynde the taile of Vrsa so clere; Of Pliades he prechid with ther drowsy chere, Immoysturid with mislyng and ay droppyng dry, And where the two Trions a man shold aspy, And of the winter days that hy them so fast, And of the wynter nyghtes that tary so longe, And of the somer days so longe that doth last, And of their shorte nyghtes; he browght in his songe How wronge was no ryght, and ryght was no wronge: There was counteryng of carollis in meter and verse So many, that longe it were to reherse. Occupacyon to Skelton. How say ye? is this after your appetite? May this contente you and your mirry mynde? Here dwellith pleasure, with lust and delyte; Contynuall comfort here ye may fynde, Of welth and solace no thynge left behynde; All thynge conuenable here is contryuyd, Wherewith your spiritis may be reuyuid. Poeta Skelton answeryth. Questionles no dowte of that ye say; Jupiter hymselfe this lyfe myght endure; This ioy excedith all worldly sport and play, Paradyce this place is of syngular pleasure: O wele were hym that herof myght be sure, And here to inhabite and ay for to dwell! But, goodly maystres, one thynge ye me tell. Occupacyon to Skelton. Of your demawnd shew me the content, What it is, and where vpon it standis; And if there be in it any thyng ment, Wherof the answere restyth in my handis, It shall be losyd ful sone out of the bandis Of scrupulus dout; wherfore your mynde discharge, And of your wyll the plainnes shew at large. Poeta Skelton answeryth. I thanke you, goodly maystres, to me most benynge, That of your bounte so well haue me assurid; But my request is not so great a thynge, That I ne force what though it be discurid; I am not woundid but that I may be cured; I am not ladyn of liddyrnes with lumpis, As dasid doterdis that dreme in their dumpis. Occupacyon to Skelton. Nowe what ye mene, I trow I coniect; Gog gyue you good yere, ye make me to smyle; Now, be your faith, is not this theffect Of your questyon ye make all this whyle, To vnderstande who dwellyth in yone pile, And what blunderar is yonder that playth didil diddil? He fyndith fals mesuris out of his fonde fiddill. Interpolata, quæ industriosum postulat interpretem, satira in vatis adversarium.

His name for to know if that ye lyst, Enuyous Rancour truely he hight: Beware of hym, I warne you; for and ye wist How daungerous it were to stande in his lyght, Ye wolde not dele with hym, thowgh that ye myght, For by his deuellysshe drift and graceles prouision An hole reame he is able to set at deuysion: For when he spekyth fayrest, then thynketh he moost yll; Full gloryously can he glose, thy mynde for to fele; He wyll set men a feightynge and syt hymselfe styll, And smerke, lyke a smythy kur, at sperkes of steile; He can neuer leue warke whylis it is wele; To tell all his towchis it were to grete wonder; The deuyll of hell and he be seldome asonder. Thus talkyng we went forth in at a postern gate; Turnyng on the ryght hande, by a windyng stayre, She brought me to a goodly chaumber of astate, Where the noble Cowntes of Surrey in a chayre Sat honorably, to whome did repaire Of ladys a beue with all dew reuerence: Syt downe, fayre ladys, and do your diligence! Come forth, ientylwomen, I pray you, she sayd; I haue contryuyd for you a goodly warke, And who can worke beste now shall be asayde; A cronell of lawrell with verduris light and darke I haue deuysed for Skelton, my clerke; For to his seruyce I haue suche regarde, That of our bownte we wyll hym rewarde: For of all ladyes he hath the library, Ther names recountyng in the court of Fame; Of all gentylwomen he hath the scruteny, In Fames court reportynge the same; For yet of women he neuer sayd shame, But if they were counterfettes that women them call, That list of there lewdnesse with hym for to brall. With that the tappettis and carpettis were layd, Whereon theis ladys softly myght rest, The saumpler to sow on, the lacis to enbraid; To weue in the stoule sume were full preste; With slaiis, with tauellis, with hedellis well drest, The frame was browght forth with his weuyng pin: God geue them good spede there warke to begin! Sume to enbrowder put them in prese, Well gydyng ther glowtonn to kepe streit theyr sylk, Sum pirlyng of goldde theyr worke to encrese With fingers smale, and handis whyte as mylk; With, Reche me that skane of tewly sylk; And, Wynde me that botowme of such an hew, Grene, rede, tawny, whyte, blak, purpill, and blew. Of broken warkis wrought many a goodly thyng, In castyng, in turnynge, in florisshyng of flowris, With burris rowth and bottons surffillyng, In nedill wark raysyng byrdis in bowris, With vertu enbesid all tymes and howris; And truly of theyr bownte thus were they bent To worke me this chapelet by goode aduysemente. Occupacyon to Skelton. Beholde and se in your aduertysement How theis ladys and gentylwomen all For your pleasure do there endeuourment, And for your sake how fast to warke they fall: To your remembraunce wherfore ye must call In goodly wordes plesauntly comprysid, That for them some goodly conseyt be deuysid, With proper captacyons of beneuolence, Ornatly pullysshid after your faculte, Sith ye must nedis afforce it by pretence Of your professyoun vnto vmanyte, Commensyng your proces after there degre, To iche of them rendryng thankis commendable, With sentence fructuous and termes couenable. Poeta Skelton. Auaunsynge my selfe sum thanke to deserue, I me determynyd for to sharpe my pen, Deuoutly arrectyng my prayer to Mynerue, She to vowchesafe me to informe and ken; To Mercury also hertely prayed I then, Me to supporte, to helpe, and to assist, To gyde and to gouerne my dredfull tremlyng fist. As a mariner that amasid is in a stormy rage, Hardly bestad and driuen is to hope Of that the tempestuows wynde wyll aswage, In trust wherof comforte his hart doth grope, From the anker he kuttyth the gabyll rope, Committyth all to God, and lettyth his shyp ryde; So I beseke Ihesu now to be my gyde. To the ryght noble Countes of Surrey. After all duly ordred obeisaunce, In humble wyse as lowly as I may, Vnto you, madame, I make reconusaunce, My lyfe endurynge I shall both wryte and say, Recount, reporte, reherse without delay The passynge bounte of your noble astate, Of honour and worshyp which hath the formar date: Lyke to Argyua by iust resemblaunce, The noble wyfe of Polimites kynge; Prudent Rebecca, of whome remembraunce The Byble makith; with whos chast lyuynge Your noble demenour is counterwayng, Whos passynge bounte, and ryght noble astate, Of honour and worship it hath the formar date. The noble Pamphila, quene of the Grekis londe, Habillimentis royall founde out industriously; Thamer also wrought with her goodly honde Many diuisis passynge curyously; Whome ye represent and exemplify, Whos passynge bounte, and ryght noble astate, Of honour and worship it hath the formar date. As dame Thamarys, whiche toke the kyng of Perce, Cirus by name, as wrytith the story; Dame Agrippina also I may reherse Of ientyll corage the perfight memory; So shall your name endure perpetually, Whos passyng bounte, and ryght noble astate, Of honour and worship it hath the formar date. To my lady Elisabeth Howarde. To be your remembrauncer, madame, I am bounde, Lyke to Aryna, maydenly of porte, Of vertu and konnyng the well and perfight grounde; Whome dame Nature, as wele I may reporte, Hath fresshely enbewtid with many a goodly sorte Of womanly feturis, whos florysshyng tender age Is lusty to loke on, plesaunte, demure, and sage: Goodly Creisseid, fayrer than Polexene, For to enuyue Pandarus appetite; Troilus, I trowe, if that he had you sene, In you he wolde haue set his hole delight: Of all your bewte I suffyce not to wryght; But, as I sayd, your florisshinge tender age Is lusty to loke on, plesaunt, demure, and sage. To my lady Mirriell Howarde. Mi litell lady I may not leue behinde, But do her seruyce nedis now I must; Beninge, curteyse, of ientyll harte and mynde, Whome fortune and fate playnly haue discust Longe to enioy plesure, delyght, and lust: The enbuddid blossoms of roses rede of hew With lillis whyte your bewte doth renewe. Compare you I may to Cidippes, the mayd, That of Aconcyus whan she founde the byll In her bosome, lorde, how she was afrayd! The ruddy shamefastnes in her vysage fyll, Whiche maner of abasshement became her not yll; Right so, madame, the roses redde of hew With lillys whyte your bewte dothe renewe. To my lady Anne Dakers of the Sowth. Zeuxes, that enpicturid fare Elene the quene, You to deuyse his crafte were to seke; And if Apelles your countenaunce had sene, Of porturature which was the famous Greke, He coude not deuyse the lest poynt of your cheke; Princes of yowth, and flowre of goodly porte, Vertu, conyng, solace, pleasure, comforte. Paregall in honour vnto Penolepe, That for her trowth is in remembraunce had; Fayre Diianira surmountynge in bewte; Demure Diana womanly and sad, Whos lusty lokis make heuy hartis glad; Princes of youth, and flowre of goodly porte, Vertu, connyng, solace, pleasure, comforte. To mastres Margery Wentworthe. With margerain ientyll, The flowre of goodlyhede, Enbrowdred the mantill Is of your maydenhede.

Sith mistres Iane Haiset Smale flowres helpt to sett In my goodly chapelet, Therfore I render of her the memory Vnto the legend of fare Laodomi. To maystres Isabell Pennell. By saynt Mary, my lady, Your mammy and your dady Brought forth a godely babi! My mayden Isabell, Reflaring rosabell, The flagrant camamell; The ruddy rosary, The souerayne rosemary, The praty strawbery; The columbyne, the nepte, The ieloffer well set, The propre vyolet; Enuwyd your colowre Is lyke the dasy flowre After the Aprill showre; Sterre of the morow gray, The blossom on the spray, The fresshest flowre of May; Maydenly demure, Of womanhode the lure; Wherfore I make you sure, It were an heuenly helth, It were an endeles welth, A lyfe for God hymselfe, To here this nightingale, Amonge the byrdes smale, Warbelynge in the vale, Dug, dug, Iug, iug, Good yere and good luk, With chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk! To maystres Margaret Hussey. Mirry Margaret, As mydsomer flowre, Ientill as fawcoun Or hawke of the towre; With solace and gladnes, Moche mirthe and no madnes, All good and no badnes, So ioyously, So maydenly, So womanly Her demenyng In euery thynge, Far, far passynge That I can endyght, Or suffyce to wryght Of mirry Margarete, As mydsomer flowre, Ientyll as a fawcoun Or hawke of the towre; As pacient and as styll, And as full of good wyll, As fayre Isaphill; Colyaunder, Swete pomaunder, Good cassaunder; Stedfast of thought, Wele made, wele wrought; Far may be sought Erst that ye can fynde So corteise, so kynde As mirry Margarete, This midsomer flowre, Ientyll as fawcoun Or hawke of the towre. To mastres Geretrude Statham. Though ye wer hard hertyd, And I with you thwartid With wordes that smartid, Yet nowe doutles ye geue me cause To wryte of you this goodli clause, Maistres Geretrude, With womanhode endude, With virtu well renwde.

Partly by your councell, Garnisshed with lawrell Was my fresshe coronell; Wherfore doutles ye geue me cause To wryte of you this goodly clause, Maistres Geretrude, With womanhode endude, With vertu well renude. To maystres Isabell Knyght. But if I sholde aquyte your kyndnes, Els saye ye myght That in me were grete blyndnes, I for to be so myndles, And cowde not wryght Of Isabell Knyght. It is not my custome nor my gyse To leue behynde Her that is bothe womanly and wyse, And specyally which glad was to deuyse The menes to fynde To please my mynde, In helpyng to warke my laurell grene With sylke and golde: Galathea, the made well besene, Was neuer halfe so fayre, as I wene, Whiche was extolde A thowsande folde By Maro, the Mantuan prudent, Who list to rede; But, and I had leyser competent, I coude shew you suche a presedent In very dede Howe ye excede. Occupacyon to Skelton. Withdrawe your hande, the tyme passis fast; Set on your hede this laurell whiche is wrought; Here you not Eolus for you blowyth a blaste? I dare wele saye that ye and I be sought: Make no delay, for now ye must be brought Before my ladys grace, the Quene of Fame, Where ye must breuely answere to your name. Skelton Poeta. Castyng my syght the chambre aboute, To se how duly ich thyng in ordre was, Towarde the dore, as we were comyng oute, I sawe maister Newton sit with his compas, His plummet, his pensell, his spectacles of glas, Dyuysynge in pycture, by his industrious wit, Of my laurell the proces euery whitte. Forthwith vpon this, as it were in a thought, Gower, Chawcer, Lydgate, theis thre Before remembred, me curteisly brought Into that place where as they left me, Where all the sayd poetis sat in there degre. But when they sawe my lawrell rychely wrought, All other besyde were counterfete they thought In comparyson of that whiche I ware: Sume praysed the perle, some the stones bryght; Wele was hym that therevpon myght stare; Of this warke they had so great delyght, The silke, the golde, the flowris fresshe to syght, They seyd my lawrell was the goodlyest That euer they saw, and wrought it was the best. In her astate there sat the noble Quene Of Fame: perceyuynge how that I was cum, She wonderyd me thought at my laurell grene; She loked hawtly, and gaue on me a glum: Thhere was amonge them no worde then but mum, For eche man herkynde what she wolde to me say; Wherof in substaunce I brought this away. The Quene of Fame to Skelton. My frende, sith ye ar before vs here present To answere vnto this noble audyence, Of that shalbe resonde you ye must be content; And for as moche as, by the hy pretence That ye haue now thorow preemynence Of laureat triumphe, your place is here reseruyd, We wyll vnderstande how ye haue it deseruyd. Skelton Poeta to the Quene of Fame. Ryght high and myghty princes of astate, In famous glory all other transcendyng, Of your bounte the accustomable rate Hath bene full often and yet is entendyng To all that to reason is condiscendyng, But if hastyue credence by mayntenance of myght Fortune to stande betwene you and the lyght: But suche euydence I thynke for to enduce, And so largely to lay for myne indempnite, That I trust to make myne excuse Of what charge soeuer ye lay ageinst me; For of my bokis parte ye shall se, Whiche in your recordes, I knowe well, be enrolde, And so Occupacyon, your regester, me tolde. Forthwith she commaundid I shulde take my place; Caliope poynted me where I shulde sit: With that, Occupacioun presid in a pace; Be mirry, she sayd, be not aferde a whit, Your discharge here vnder myne arme is it. So then commaundid she was vpon this To shew her boke; and she sayd, Here it is. The Quene of Fame to Occupacioun. Yowre boke of remembrauns we will now that ye rede; If ony recordis in noumbyr can be founde, What Skelton hath compilid and wryton in dede Rehersyng by ordre, and what is the grownde, Let se now for hym how ye can expounde; For in owr courte, ye wote wele, his name can not ryse But if he wryte oftenner than ones or twyse. Skelton Poeta. With that of the boke losende were the claspis: The margent was illumynid all with golden railles And byse, enpicturid with gressoppes and waspis, With butterfllyis and fresshe pecoke taylis, Enflorid with flowris and slymy snaylis; Enuyuid picturis well towchid and quikly; It wolde haue made a man hole that had be ryght sekely, To beholde how it was garnysshyd and bounde, Encouerde ouer with golde of tissew fyne; The claspis and bullyons were worth a thousande pounde; With balassis and charbuncles the borders did shyne; With aurum musicum euery other lyne Was wrytin: and so she did her spede, Occupacyoun, inmediatly to rede. Occupacyoun redith and expoundyth sum parte of Skeltons bokes and baladis with ditis of plesure, in as moche as it were to longe a proces to reherse all by name that he hath compylyd, &amp;c. Of your oratour and poete laureate Of Englande, his workis here they begynne: In primis the Boke of Honorous Astate; Item the Boke how men shulde fle synne; Item Royall Demenaunce worshyp to wynne; Item the Boke to speke well or be styll; Item to lerne you to dye when ye wyll; Of Vertu also the souerayne enterlude; The Boke of the Rosiar; Prince Arturis Creacyoun; The False Fayth that now goth, which dayly is renude; Item his Diologgis of Ymagynacyoun; Item Antomedon of Loues Meditacyoun; Item New Gramer in Englysshe compylyd; Item Bowche of Courte, where Drede was begyled; His commedy, Achademios callyd by name; Of Tullis Familiars the translacyoun; Item Good Aduysement, that brainles doth blame; The Recule ageinst Gaguyne of the Frenshe nacyoun; Item the Popingay, that hath in commendacyoun Ladyes and gentylwomen suche as deseruyd, And suche as be counterfettis they be reseruyd; And of Soueraynte a noble pamphelet; And of Magnyfycence a notable mater, How Cownterfet Cowntenaunce of the new get With Crafty Conueyaunce dothe smater and flater, And Cloked Collucyoun is brought in to clater With Courtely Abusyoun; who pryntith it wele in mynde Moche dowblenes of the worlde therin he may fynde; Of manerly maistres Margery Mylke and Ale; To her he wrote many maters of myrthe; Yet, thoughe I say it, therby lyith a tale, For Margery wynshed, and breke her hinder girth; Lor, how she made moche of her gentyll birth! With, Gingirly, go gingerly! her tayle was made of hay; Go she neuer so gingirly, her honesty is gone away; Harde to make ought of that is nakid nought; This fustiane maistres and this giggisse gase, Wonder is to wryte what wrenchis she wrowght, To face out her foly with a midsomer mase; With pitche she patchid her pitcher shuld not crase; It may wele ryme, but shroudly it doth accorde, To pyke out honesty of suche a potshorde: Patet per versus. Hinc puer hic natus; vir conjugis hinc spoliatus Jure thori; est fœtus Deli de sanguine cretus; Hinc magis extollo, quod erit puer alter Apollo; Si quæris qualis? meretrix castissima talis; Et relis, et ralis, et reliqualis. A good herynge of thes olde talis; Fynde no mo suche fro Wanflete to Walis. Et reliqua omelia de diversis tractatibus. Of my ladys grace at the contemplacyoun, Owt of Frenshe into Englysshe prose, Of Mannes Lyfe the Peregrynacioun, He did translate, enterprete, and disclose; The Tratyse of Triumphis of the Rede Rose, Wherein many storis ar breuely contayned That vnremembred longe tyme remayned; The Duke of Yorkis creauncer whan Skelton was, Now Henry the viij. Kyng of Englonde, A tratyse he deuysid and browght it to pas, Callid Speculum Principis, to bere in his honde, Therin to rede, and to vnderstande All the demenour of princely astate, To be our Kyng, of God preordinate; Also the Tunnynge of Elinour Rummyng, With Colyn Clowt, Iohnn Iue, with Ioforth Iack; To make suche trifels it asketh sum konnyng, In honest myrth parde requyreth no lack; The whyte apperyth the better for the black, And after conueyauns as the world goos, It is no foly to vse the Walshemannys hoos; The vmblis of venyson, the botell of wyne, To fayre maistres Anne that shuld haue be sent, He wrate therof many a praty lyne, Where it became, and whether it went, And how that it was wantonly spent; The Balade also of the Mustarde Tarte Suche problemis to paynt it longyth to his arte; Of one Adame all a knaue, late dede and gone,— Dormiat in pace, lyke a dormows!— He wrate an Epitaph for his graue stone, With wordes deuoute and sentence agerdows, For he was euer ageynst Goddis hows, All his delight was to braule and to barke Ageynst holy chyrche, the preste, and the clarke; Of Phillip Sparow the lamentable fate, The dolefull desteny, and the carefull chaunce, Dyuysed by Skelton after the funerall rate; Yet sum there be therewith that take greuaunce, And grudge therat with frownyng countenaunce; But what of that? hard it is to please all men; Who list amende it, let hym set to his penne; For the gyse now adays Of sum iangelyng iays Is to discommende That they can not amende, Though they wolde spende All the wittis they haue. What ayle them to depraue Phillippe Sparows graue? His Dirige, her Commendacioun Can be no derogacyoun, But myrth and consolacyoun, Made by protestacyoun, No man to myscontent With Phillippis enteremente. Alas, that goodly mayd, Why shulde she be afrayd? Why shulde she take shame That her goodly name, Honorably reportid, Shulde be set and sortyd, To be matriculate With ladyes of astate? I coniure thé, Phillip Sparow, By Hercules that hell did harow, And with a venomows arow Slew of the Epidawris One of the Centawris, Or Onocentauris, Or Hippocentauris; By whos myght and maine An hart was slayne With hornnis twayne Of glitteryng golde; And the apples of golde Of Hesperides withholde, And with a dragon kepte That neuer more slepte, By merciall strength He wan at length; And slew Gerione With thre bodys in one; With myghty corrage Adauntid the rage Of a lyon sauage; Of Diomedis stabyll He brought out a rabyll Of coursers and rounsis With lepes and bounsis; And with myghty luggyng, Wrastelynge and tuggyng, He pluckid the bull By the hornid scull, And offred to Cornucopia; And so forthe per cetera: Also by Hectates bowre In Plutos gastly towre; By the vgly Eumenides, That neuer haue rest nor ease; By the venemows serpent That in hell is neuer brente, In Lerna the Grekis fen That was engendred then; By Chemeras flamys, And all the dedely namys Of infernall posty, Where soulis fry and rosty; By the Stigiall flode, And the stremes wode Of Cochitos bottumles well; By the feryman of hell, Caron with his berde hore, That rowyth with a rude ore, And with his frownsid fortop Gydith his bote with a prop: I coniure Phillippe, and call, In the name of Kyng Saull; Primo Regum expres, He bad the Phitones To witche craft her to dres, And by her abusiouns, And damnable illusiouns Of meruelous conclusiouns, And by her supersticiouns Of wonderfull condiciouns, She raysed vp in that stede Samuell that was dede; But whether it were so, He were idem in numero, The selfe same Samuell, How be it to Saull he did tell The Philistinis shulde hym askry, And the next day he shulde dye, I wyll my selfe discharge To letterd men at large: But, Phillip, I coniure thé Now by theys names thre, Diana in the woddis grene, Luna that so bryght doth shene, Proserpina in hell, That thou shortely tell, And shew now vnto me What the cause may be Of this perplexyte! Inferias, Philippe, tuas Scroupe pulchra Joanna Instanter petiit: cur nostri carminis illam Nunc pudet? est sero; minor est infamia vero. Then such that haue disdaynyd And of this worke complaynyd, I pray God they be paynyd No wors than is contaynyd In verses two or thre That folowe as ye may se: Luride, cur, livor, volucris pia funera damnas? Talia te rapiant rapiunt quæ fata volucrem! Est tamen invidia mors tibi continua: The Gruntyng and the groynninge of the gronnyng swyne; Also the Murnyng of the mapely rote; How the grene couerlet sufferd grete pine, When the flye net was set for to catche a cote, Strake one with a birdbolt to the hart rote; Also a deuoute Prayer to Moyses hornis, Metrifyde merely, medelyd with scornis; Of paiauntis that were played in Ioyows Garde; He wrate of a muse throw a mud wall; How a do cam trippyng in at the rere warde, But, lorde, how the parker was wroth with all! And of Castell Aungell the fenestrall, Glittryng and glistryng and gloryously glasid, It made sum mens eyn dasild and dasid; The Repete of the recule of Rosamundis bowre, Of his pleasaunt paine there and his glad distres In plantynge and pluckynge a propre ieloffer flowre; But how it was, sum were to recheles, Not withstandynge it is remedeles; What myght she say? what myght he do therto? Though Iak sayd nay, yet Mok there loste her sho; How than lyke a man he wan the barbican With a sawte of solace at the longe last; The colour dedely, swarte, blo, and wan Of Exione, her lambis dede and past, The cheke and the nek but a shorte cast; In fortunis fauour euer to endure, No man lyuyng, he sayth, can be sure; How dame Minerua first found the olyue tre, she red And plantid it there where neuer before was none; vnshred An hynde vnhurt hit by casuelte, not bled Recouerd whan the forster was gone; and sped The hertis of the herd began for to grone, and fled The howndes began to yerne and to quest; and dred With litell besynes standith moche rest; in bed His Epitomis of the myller and his ioly make; How her ble was bryght as blossom on the spray, A wanton wenche and wele coude bake a cake; The myllar was loth to be out of the way, But yet for all that, be as be may, Whether he rode to Swaffhamm or to Some, The millar durst not leue his wyfe at home; With, Wofully arayd, and Shamefully betrayd, Of his makyng deuoute medytacyons; Vexilla regis he deuysid to be displayd; With Sacris solemniis, and other contemplacyouns, That in them comprisid consyderacyons; Thus passyth he the tyme both nyght and day, Sumtyme with sadnes, sumtyme with play; Though Galiene and Dioscorides, With Ipocras, and mayster Auycen, By there phesik doth many a man ease, And though Albumasar can thé enforme and ken What constellacions ar good or bad for men, Yet whan the rayne rayneth and the gose wynkith, Lytill wotith the goslyng what the gose thynkith; He is not wyse ageyne the streme that stryuith; Dun is in the myre, dame, reche me my spur; Nedes must he rin that the deuyll dryuith; When the stede is stolyn, spar the stable dur; A ientyll hownde shulde neuer play the kur; It is sone aspyed where the thorne prikkith; And wele wotith the cat whos berde she likkith; With Marione clarione, sol, lucerne, Graund juir, of this Frenshe prouerbe olde, How men were wonte for to discerne By candelmes day what wedder shuld holde; But Marione clarione was caught with a colde colde, anglice a cokwolde, And all ouercast with cloudis vnkynde, This goodly flowre with stormis was vntwynde; This ieloffer ientyll, this rose, this lylly flowre, This primerose pereles, this propre vyolet, This columbyne clere and fresshest of coloure, This delycate dasy, this strawbery pretely set, With frowarde frostis, alas, was all to-fret! But who may haue a more vngracyous lyfe Than a chyldis birde and a knauis wyfe? Thynke what ye wyll Of this wanton byll; By Mary Gipcy, Quod scripsi, scripsi: Uxor tua, sicut vitis, Habetis in custodiam, Custodite sicut scitis, Secundum Lucam, &amp;c. Of the Bonehoms of Ashrige besyde Barkamstede, That goodly place to Skelton moost kynde, Where the sank royall is, Crystes blode so rede, Wherevpon he metrefyde after his mynde; A pleasaunter place than Ashrige is, harde were to fynde, As Skelton rehersith, with wordes few and playne, In his distichon made on verses twaine; Fraxinus in clivo frondetque viret sine rivo, Non est sub divo similis sine flumine vivo; The Nacyoun of Folys he left not behynde; Item Apollo that whirllid vp his chare, That made sum to snurre and snuf in the wynde; It made them to skip, to stampe, and to stare, Whiche, if they be happy, haue cause to beware In ryming and raylyng with hym for to mell, For drede that he lerne them there A, B, C, to spell. Poeta Skelton. With that I stode vp, halfe sodenly afrayd; Suppleyng to Fame, I besought her grace, And that it wolde please her, full tenderly I prayd, Owt of her bokis Apollo to rase. Nay, sir, she sayd, what so in this place Of our noble courte is ones spoken owte, It must nedes after rin all the worlde aboute. God wote, theis wordes made me full sad; And when that I sawe it wolde no better be, But that my peticyon wolde not be had, What shulde I do but take it in gre? For, by Juppiter and his high mageste, I did what I cowde to scrape out the scrollis, Apollo to rase out of her ragman rollis. Now hereof it erkith me lenger to wryte; To Occupacyon I wyll agayne resorte, Whiche redde on still, as it cam to her syght, Rendrynge my deuisis I made in disporte Of the Mayden of Kent callid Counforte, Of Louers testamentis and of there wanton wyllis, And how Iollas louyd goodly Phillis; Diodorus Siculus of my translacyon Out of fresshe Latine into owre Englysshe playne, Recountyng commoditis of many a straunge nacyon; Who redyth it ones wolde rede it agayne; Sex volumis engrosid together it doth containe: But when of the laurell she made rehersall, All orators and poetis, with other grete and smale, A thowsande thowsande, I trow, to my dome, Triumpha, triumpha! they cryid all aboute; Of trumpettis and clariouns the noyse went to Rome; The starry heuyn, me thought, shoke with the showte; The grownde gronid and tremblid, the noyse was so stowte: The Quene of Fame commaundid shett fast the boke; And therwith sodenly out of my dreme I woke. My mynde of the grete din was somdele amasid, I wypid myne eyne for to make them clere; Then to the heuyn sperycall vpwarde I gasid, Where I saw Ianus, with his double chere, Makynge his almanak for the new yere; He turnyd his tirikkis, his voluell ran fast: Good luk this new yere! the olde yere is past.

THE BOKE COMPILED BY MAISTER SKELTON, POET LAUREAT, CALLED SPEAKE, PARROT. Italicized passages in the following poem have not been given language attributes. [Lectoribus auctor recipit opusculi hujus auxesim. Crescet in immensum me vivo pagina præsens; Hinc mea dicetur Skeltonidis aurea fama. Parot.] My name is Parrot, a byrd of paradyse, By nature deuysed of a wonderous kynde, Dyentely dyeted with dyuers dylycate spyce, Tyl Euphrates, that flode, dryueth me into Inde; Where men of that countrey by fortune me fynd, And send me to greate ladyes of estate; Then Parot must haue an almon or a date: A cage curyously caruen, with syluer pyn, Properly paynted, to be my couertowre; A myrrour of glasse, that I may toote therin; These maidens ful mekely with many a diuers flowre Freshly they dresse, and make swete my bowre, With, Speke, Parrot, I pray you, full curtesly they say; Parrot is a goodly byrd, a prety popagey: With my becke bent my lyttyl wanton eye, My fedders freshe as is the emrawde grene, About my neck a cyrculet lyke the ryche rubye, My lyttyll leggys, my feet both fete and clene, I am a mynyon to wayt vppon a quene; My proper Parrot, my lyttyl prety foole; With ladyes I lerne, and go with them to scole. Hagh, ha, ha, Parrot, ye can laugh pretyly! Parrot hath not dyned of al this long day: Lyke your pus cate, Parrot can mute and cry In Lattyn, in Ebrew, Araby, and Caldey; In Greke tong Parrot can bothe speke and say, As Percyus, that poet, doth reporte of me, Quis expedivit psittaco suum chaire? Dowse French of Parryse Parrot can lerne, Pronounsynge my purpose after my properte, With, Perliez byen, Parrot, ou perlez rien; With Douch, with Spanysh, my tong can agre; In Englysh to God Parrot can supple, Cryst saue Kyng Henry the viii., our royall kyng, The red rose in honour to florysh and sprynge! With Kateryne incomparable, our ryall quene also, That pereles pomegarnet, Chryst saue her noble grace! Parrot, saves habler Castiliano, With fidasso de cosso in Turkey and in Trace; Vis consilii expers, as techith me Horace, Mole ruit sua, whose dictes ar pregnaunte, Souentez foys, Parrot, en souenaunte. My lady maystres, dame Philology, Gaue me a gyfte in my nest whan I laye, To lerne all language, and it to spake aptely: Now pandez mory, wax frantycke, some men saye, Phroneses for Freneses may not holde her way. An almon now for Parrot, dilycatly drest; In Salve festa dies, toto theyr doth best. Moderata juvant, but toto doth excede; Dyscressyon is moder of noble vertues all; Myden agan in Greke tonge we rede; But reason and wyt wantyth theyr prouyncyall When wylfulnes is vycar generall. Hæc res acu tangitur, Parrot, par ma foy: Ticez vous, Parrot, tenez vous coye. Besy, besy, besy, and besynes agayne! Que pensez voz, Parrot? what meneth this besynes? Vitulus in Oreb troubled Arons brayne, Melchisedeck mercyfull made Moloc mercyles; To wyse is no vertue, to medlyng, to restles; In mesure is tresure, cum sensu maturato; Ne tropo sanno, ne tropo mato. Aram was fyred with Caldies fyer called Ur; Iobab was brought vp in the lande of Hus; The lynage of Lot toke supporte of Assur; Iereboseth is Ebrue, who lyst the cause dyscus. Peace, Parrot, ye prate, as ye were ebrius: Howst thé, lyuer god van hemrik, ic seg; In Popering grew peres, whan Parrot was an eg. What is this to purpose? Ouer in a whynny meg! Hop Lobyn of Lowdeon wald haue e byt of bred; The iebet of Baldock was made for Jack Leg; An arrow vnfethered and without an hed, A bagpype without blowynge standeth in no sted: Some run to far before, some run to far behynde, Some be to churlysshe, and some be to kynde. Ic dien serueth for the erstrych fether, Ic dien is the language of the land of Beme; In Affryc tongue byrsa is a thonge of lether; In Palestina there is Ierusalem. Colostrum now for Parot, whyte bred and swete creme! Our Thomasen she doth trip, our Ienet she doth shayle: Parrot hath a blacke beard and a fayre grene tayle. Moryshe myne owne shelfe, the costermonger sayth; Fate, fate, fate, ye Irysh water lag; In flattryng fables men fynde but lyttyl fayth: But moveatur terra, let the world wag; Let syr Wrigwrag wrastell with syr Delarag; Euery man after his maner of wayes, Pawbe une aruer, so the Welche man sayes. Suche shredis of sentence, strowed in the shop Of auncyent Aristippus and such other mo, I gader togyther and close in my crop, Of my wanton conseyt, unde depromo Dilemmata docta in pædagogio Sacro vatum, whereof to you I breke: I pray you, let Parot haue lyberte to speke. But ware the cat, Parot, ware the fals cat! With, Who is there? a mayd? nay, nay, I trow: Ware ryat, Parrot, ware ryot, ware that! Mete, mete for Parrot, mete, I say, how! Thus dyuers of language by lernyng I grow: With, Bas me, swete Parrot, bas me, swete swete; To dwell amonge ladyes Parrot is mete. Parrot, Parrot, Parrot, praty popigay! With my beke I can pyke my lyttel praty too My delyght is solas, pleasure, dysporte, and pley; Lyke a wanton, whan I wyll, I rele to and froo: Parot can say, Cæsar, ave, also; But Parrot hath no fauour to Esebon: Aboue all other byrdis, set Parrot alone. Ulula, Esebon, for Ieromy doth wepe! Sion is in sadnes, Rachell ruly doth loke; Madionita Ietro, our Moyses kepyth his shepe; Gedeon is gon, that Zalmane vndertoke, Oreb et Zeb, of Judicum rede the boke; Now Geball, Amon, and Amaloch,—harke, harke! Parrot pretendith to be a bybyll clarke. O Esebon, Esebon! to thè is cum agayne Seon, the regent Amorræorum, And Og, that fat hog of Basan, doth retayne, The crafty coistronus Cananæorum; And asylum, whilom refugium miserorum, Non fanum, sed profanum, standyth in lyttyll sted: Ulula, Esebon, for Iepte is starke ded! Esebon, Marybon, Wheston next Barnet; A trym tram for an horse myll it were a nyse thyng; Deyntes for dammoysels, chaffer far fet: Bo ho doth bark wel, but Hough ho he rulyth the ring; From Scarpary to Tartary renoun therin doth spryng, With, He sayd, and we said, ich wot now what ich wot, Quod magnus est dominus Judas Scarioth. Tholomye and Haly were cunnyng and wyse In the volvell, in the quadrant, and in the astroloby, To pronostycate truly the chaunce of fortunys dyse; Som trete of theyr tirykis, som of astrology, Som pseudo-propheta with chiromancy: Yf fortune be frendly, and grace be the guyde, Honowre with renowne wyll ren on that syde. Monon calon agaton, Qoud Parato In Græco. Let Parrot, I pray you, haue lyberte to prate, For aurea lingua Græca ought to be magnyfyed, Yf it were cond perfytely, and after the rate, As lingua Latina, in scole matter occupyed; But our Grekis theyr Greke so well haue applyed, That they cannot say in Greke, rydynge by the way, How, hosteler, fetche my hors a botell of hay! Neyther frame a silogisme in phrisesomorum, Formaliter et Græce, cum medio termino: Our Grekys ye walow in the washbol Argolicorum; For though ye can tell in Greke what is phormio, Yet ye seke out your Greke in Capricornio; For they scrape out good scrypture, and set in a gall, Ye go about to amende, and ye mare all. Some argue secundum quid ad simpliciter, And yet he wolde be rekenyd pro Areopagita; And some make distinctions multipliciter, Whether ita were before non, or non before ita, Nether wise nor wel lernid, but like hermaphrodita: Set sophia asyde, for euery Jack Raker And euery mad medler must now be a maker. In Academia Parrot dare no probleme kepe; For Græce fari so occupyeth the chayre, That Latinum fari may fall to rest and slepe, And syllogisari was drowned at Sturbrydge fayre; Tryuyals and quatryuyals so sore now they appayre, That Parrot the popagay hath pytye to beholde How the rest of good lernyng is roufled vp and trold. Albertus de modo significandi, And Donatus be dryuen out of scole; Prisians hed broken now handy dandy, And Inter didascolos is rekened for a fole; Alexander, a gander of Menanders pole, With Da Cansales, is cast out of the gate, And Da Racionales dare not shew his pate. Plauti in his comedies a chyld shall now reherse, And medyll with Quintylyan in his Declamacyons, That Pety Caton can scantly construe a verse, With Aveto in Græco, and such solempne salutacyons, Can skantly the tensis of his coniugacyons; Settynge theyr myndys so moche of eloquens, That of theyr scole maters lost is the hole sentens. Now a nutmeg, a nutmeg, cum gariopholo, For Parrot to pyke vpon, his brayne for to stable, Swete synamum styckis and pleris cum musco! In Paradyce, that place of pleasure perdurable, The progeny of Parrottis were fayre and fauorable; Nowe in valle Ebron Parrot is fayne to fede: Cristecrosse and saynt Nycholas, Parrot, be your good spede! The myrrour that I tote in, quasi diaphanum, Vel quasi speculum, in ænigmate, Elencticum, or ells enthymematicum, For logicions to loke on, somwhat sophistice: Retoricyons and oratours in freshe humanyte, Support Parrot, I pray you, with your suffrage ornate, Of confuse tantum auoydynge the chekmate. But of that supposicyon that callyd is arte Confuse distributive, as Parrot hath deuysed, Let euery man after his merit take his parte, For in this processe Parrot nothing hath surmysed, No matter pretendyd, nor nothyng enterprysed, But that metaphora, allegoria with all, Shall be his protectyon, his pauys, and his wall. For Parot is no churlish chowgh, nor no flekyd pye, Parrot is no pendugum, that men call a carlyng, Parrot is no woodecocke, nor no butterfly, Parrot is no stameryng stare, that men call a starlyng; But Parot is my owne dere harte and my dere derling; Melpomene, that fayre mayde, she burneshed his beke: I pray you, let Parrot haue lyberte to speke. Parrot is a fayre byrd for a lady; God of his goodnes him framed and wrought; When Parrot is ded, she dothe not putrefy: Ye, all thyng mortall shall torne vnto nought, Except mannes soule, that Chryst so dere bought; That neuer may dye, nor neuer dye shall: Make moche of Parrot, the popegay ryall. For that pereles prynce that Parrot dyd create, He made you of nothynge by his magistye: Poynt well this probleme that Parrot doth prate, And remembre amonge how Parrot and ye Shall lepe from this lyfe, as mery as we be; Pompe, pryde, honour, ryches, and worldly lust, Parrot sayth playnly, shall tourne all to dust. Thus Parrot dothe pray you With hert most tender, To rekyn with this recule now, And it to remember. Psittacus, ecce, cano, nec sunt mea carmina Phœbo Digna scio, tamen est plena camena deo.

The relucent mirror for all Prelats and Presidents, as well spirituall as temporall, sadly to loke vpon, deuised in English by Skelton. All noble men, of this take hede, And beleue it as your Crede. To hasty of sentence, To ferce for none offence, To scarce of your expence, To large in neglygence, To slacke in recompence, To haute in excellence, To lyght [in] intellegence, And to lyght in credence; Where these kepe resydence, Reson is banysshed thence, And also dame Prudence, With sober Sapyence. All noble men, of this take hede, And beleue it as your Crede. Than without collusyon, Marke well this conclusyon, Thorow suche abusyon, And by suche illusyon, Vnto great confusyon A noble man may fall, And his honour appall; And yf ye thynke this shall Not rubbe you on the gall, Than the deuyll take all! All noble men, of this take hede, And beleue it as your Crede. Hœc vates ille, De quo loquuntur mille. WHY COME YE NAT TO COURT? For age is a page For the courte full vnmete, For age cannat rage, Nor basse her swete swete: But whan age seeth that rage Dothe aswage and refrayne, Than wyll age haue a corage To come to court agayne. But Helas, sage ouerage So madly decayes, That age for dottage Is reconed now adayes: Thus age (a graunt domage) Is nothynge set by, And rage in arerage Dothe rynne lamentably. So That rage must make pyllage, To catche that catche may, And with suche forage Hunte the boskage, That hartes wyll ronne away; Bothe hartes and hyndes, With all good myndes: Fare well, than, haue good day! Than, haue good daye, adewe! For defaute of rescew, Some men may happely rew, And some theyr hedes mew; The tyme dothe fast ensew, That bales begynne to brew: I drede, by swete Iesu, This tale wyll be to trew; In faythe, dycken, thou krew, In fayth, dicken, thou krew, &amp;c. Dicken, thou krew doutlesse; For, trewly to expresse, There hath ben moche excesse, With banketynge braynlesse, With ryotynge rechelesse, With gambaudynge thryftlesse, With spende and wast witlesse, Treatinge of trewse restlesse, Pratynge for peace peaslesse. The countrynge at Cales Wrang vs on the males: Chefe counselour was carlesse, Gronynge, grouchyng, gracelesse; And to none entente Our talwod is all brent, Our fagottes are all spent, We may blowe at the cole: Our mare hath cast her fole, And Mocke hath lost her sho; What may she do therto? An ende of an olde song, Do ryght and do no wronge, As ryght as a rammes horne; For thrifte is threde bare worne, Our shepe are shrewdly shorne, And trouthe is all to-torne; Wysdom is laught to skorne, Fauell is false forsworne, Iauell is nobly borne, Hauell and Haruy Hafter, Iack Trauell and Cole Crafter, We shall here more herafter; With pollynge and shauynge, With borowynge and crauynge, With reuynge and rauynge, With swerynge and starynge, Ther vayleth no resonynge, For wyll dothe rule all thynge, Wyll, wyll, wyll, wyll, wyll, He ruleth alway styll. Good reason and good skyll, They may garlycke pyll, Cary sackes to the myll, Or pescoddes they may shyll, Or elles go rost a stone: There is no man but one That hathe the strokes alone; Be it blacke or whight, All that he dothe is ryght, As right as a cammocke croked. This byll well ouer loked, Clerely perceuye we may There went the hare away, The hare, the fox, the gray, The harte, the hynde, the buck: God sende vs better luck! God sende vs better lucke, &amp;c. Twit, Andrewe, twit, Scot, Ge heme, ge scour thy pot; For we haue spente our shot: We shall haue a tot quot From the Pope of Rome, To weue all in one lome A webbe of lylse wulse, Opus male dulce: The deuyll kysse his cule! For, whyles he doth rule, All is warse and warse; The deuyll kysse his arse! For whether he blesse or curse, It can not be moche worse. From Baumberow to Bothombar We haue cast vp our war, And made a worthy trewse, With, gup, leuell suse! Our mony madly lent, And mor madly spent: From Croydon to Kent, Wote ye whyther they went? From Wynchelsey to Rye, And all nat worth a flye; From Wentbridge to Hull; Our armye waxeth dull, With, tourne all home agayne, And neuer a Scot slayne. Yet the good Erle of Surray, The Frenche men he doth fray, And vexeth them day by day With all the power he may; The French men he hath faynted, And made theyr hertes attaynted: Of cheualry he is the floure; Our Lorde be his soccoure! The French men he hathe so mated, And theyr courage abated, That they are but halfe men; Lyke foxes in theyr denne, Lyke cankerd cowardes all, Lyke vrcheons in a stone wall, They kepe them in theyr holdes, Lyke henherted cokoldes. But yet they ouer shote vs Wyth crownes and wyth scutus; With scutis and crownes of gold I drede we are bought and solde; It is a wonders warke: They shote all at one marke, At the Cardynals hat, They shote all at that; Oute of theyr stronge townes They shote at him with crownes; With crownes of golde enblased They make him so amased, And his eyen so dased, That he ne se can To know God nor man. He is set so hye In his ierarchy Of frantycke frenesy And folysshe fantasy, That in the Chambre of Starres All maters there he marres; Clappyng his rod on the borde, No man dare speke a worde, For he hathe all the sayenge, Without any renayenge; He rolleth in his recordes, He sayth, How saye ye, my lordes? Is nat my reason good? Good euyn, good Robyn Hood! Some say yes, and some Syt styll as they were dom: Thus thwartyng ouer thom, He ruleth all the roste With braggynge and with bost; Borne vp on euery syde With pompe and with pryde, With, trompe vp, alleluya! For dame Philargerya Hathe so his herte in holde, He loueth nothyng but golde; And Asmodeus of hell Maketh his membres swell With Dalyda to mell, That wanton damosell. Adew, Philosophia, Adew, Theologia! Welcome, dame Simonia, With dame Castrimergia, To drynke and for to eate Swete ypocras and swete meate! To kepe his flesshe chast, In Lent for a repast He eateth capons stewed, Fesaunt and partriche mewed, Hennes, checkynges, and pygges; He foynes and he frygges, Spareth neither mayde ne wyfe: This is a postels lyfe! Helas! my herte is sory To tell of vayne glory: But now vpon this story I wyll no further ryme Tyll another tyme, Tyll another tyme, &amp;c. What newes, what newes? Small newes the true is, That be worth ii. kues; But at the naked stewes, I vnderstande how that The sygne of the Cardynall Hat, That inne is now shyt vp, With, gup, hore, gup, now gup, Gup, Guilliam Trauillian, With, iast you, I say, Jullian! Wyll ye bere no coles? A mayny of marefoles, That occupy theyr holys, Full of pocky molys. What here ye of Lancashyre? They were nat payde their hyre; They are fel as any fyre. What here ye of Chesshyre? They haue layde all in the myre; They grugyd, and sayde Theyr wages were nat payde; Some sayde they were afrayde Of the Scottysshe hoste, For all theyr crack and bost, Wylde fyre and thonder; For all this worldly wonder, A hundred myle asonder They were whan they were next; That is a trew text. What here ye of the Scottes? They make vs all sottes, Poppynge folysshe dawes; They make vs to pyll strawes; They play their olde pranckes, After Huntley bankes: At the streme of Banockes burne They dyd vs a shrewde turne, Whan Edwarde of Karnaruan Lost all that his father wan. What here ye of the Lorde Dakers? He maketh vs Jacke Rakers; He sayes we ar but crakers; He calleth vs England men Stronge herted lyke an hen; For the Scottes and he To well they do agre, With, do thou for me, And I shall do for thé. Whyles the red hat doth endure, He maketh himselfe cock sure; The red hat with his lure Bryngeth all thynges vnder cure. But, as the worlde now gose, What here ye of the Lorde Rose? Nothynge to purpose, Nat worth a cockly fose: Their hertes be in thyr hose. The Erle of Northumberlande Dare take nothynge on hande: Our barons be so bolde, Into a mouse hole they wolde Rynne away and crepe; Lyke a mayny of shepe, Dare nat loke out at dur For drede of the mastyue cur, For drede of the bochers dogge Wold wyrry them lyke an hogge. For and this curre do gnar, They must stande all a far, To holde vp their hande at the bar. For all their noble blode He pluckes them by the hode, And shakes them by the eare, And brynge[s] them in suche feare; He bayteth them lyke a bere, Lyke an oxe or a bull: Theyr wyttes, he saith, are dull; He sayth they haue no brayne Theyr astate to mayntayne; And maketh them to bow theyr kne Before his maieste. Juges of the kynges lawes, He countys them foles and dawes; Sergyantes of the coyfe eke, He sayth they are to seke In pletynge of theyr case At the Commune Place, Or at the Kynges Benche; He wryngeth them suche a wrenche, That all our lerned men Dare nat set theyr penne To plete a trew tryall Within Westmynster hall; In the Chauncery where he syttes, But suche as he admyttes None so hardy to speke; He sayth, thou huddy peke, Thy lernynge is to lewde, Thy tonge is nat well thewde, To seke before our grace; And openly in that place He rages and he raues, And cals them cankerd knaues; Thus royally he dothe deale Vnder the kynges brode seale; And in the Checker he them cheks; In the Ster Chambre he noddis and beks, And bereth him there so stowte, That no man dare rowte, Duke, erle, baron, nor lorde, But to his sentence must accorde; Whether he be knyght or squyre, All men must folow his desyre. What say ye of the Scottysh kynge? That is another thyng. He is but an yonglyng, A stalworthy stryplyng: There is a whyspring and a whipling, He shulde be hyder brought; But, and it were well sought, I trow all wyll be nought, Nat worth a shyttel cocke, Nor worth a sowre calstocke. There goth many a lye Of the Duke of Albany, That of shulde go his hede, And brought in quycke or dede, And all Scotlande owers The mountenaunce of two houres. But, as some men sayne, I drede of some false trayne Subtelly wrought shall be Vnder a fayned treatee; But within monethes thre Men may happely se The trechery and the prankes Of the Scottysshe bankes. What here ye of Burgonyons, And the Spainyardes onyons? They haue slain our Englisshmen Aboue threscore and ten: For all your amyte, No better they agre. God saue my lorde admyrell! What here ye of Mutrell? There with I dare nat mell. Yet what here ye tell Of our graunde counsell? I coulde say some what, But speke ye no more of that, For drede of the red hat Take peper in the nose; For than thyne heed of gose, Of by the harde arse. But there is some trauarse Bytwene some and some, That makys our syre to glum; It is some what wronge, That his berde is so longe; He morneth in blacke clothynge. I pray God saue the kynge! Where euer he go or ryde, I pray God be his gyde! Thus wyll I conclude my style, And fall to rest a whyle, And so to rest a whyle, &amp;c. Ones yet agayne Of you I wolde frayne, Why come ye nat to court?— To whyche court? To the kynges courte, Or to Hampton Court?— Nay, to the kynges court: The kynges courte Shulde haue the excellence; But Hampton Court Hath the preemynence, And Yorkes Place, With my lordes grace, To whose magnifycence Is all the conflewence, Sutys and supplycacyons, Embassades of all nacyons. Strawe for lawe canon, Or for the lawe common, Or for lawe cyuyll! It shall be as he wyll: Stop at law tancrete, An obstract or a concrete; Be it soure, be it swete, His wysdome is so dyscrete, That in a fume or an hete, Wardeyn of the Flete, Set hym fast by the fete! And of his royall powre Whan him lyst to lowre, Than, haue him to the Towre, Saunz aulter remedy, Haue hym forthe by and by To the Marshalsy, Or to the Kynges Benche! He dyggeth so in the trenche Of the court royall, That he ruleth them all. So he dothe vndermynde, And suche sleyghtes dothe fynde, That the kynges mynde By hym is subuerted, And so streatly coarted In credensynge his tales, That all is but nutshales That any other sayth; He hath in him suche fayth. Now, yet all this myght be Suffred and taken in gre, If that that he wrought To any good ende were brought; But all he bringeth to nought, By God, that me dere bought! He bereth the kyng on hand, That he must pyll his lande, To make his cofers ryche; But he laythe all in the dyche, And vseth suche abusyoun, That in the conclusyoun All commeth to confusyon. Perceyue the cause why, To tell the trouth playnly, He is so ambicyous, So shamles, and so vicyous, And so supersticyous, And so moche obliuyous From whens that he came, That he falleth into a cæciam, Whiche, truly to expresse, Is a forgetfulnesse, Or wylfull blyndnesse, Wherwith the Sodomites Lost theyr inward syghtes, The Gommoryans also Were brought to deedly wo, As Scrypture recordis: A cœcitate cordis, In the Latyne synge we, Libera nos, Domine! But this madde Amalecke, Lyke to a Mamelek, He regardeth lordes No more than potshordes; He is in suche elacyon Of his exaltacyon, And the supportacyon Of our souerayne lorde, That, God to recorde, He ruleth all at wyll, Without reason or skyll: How be it the primordyall Of his wretched originall, And his base progeny, And his gresy genealogy, He came of the sank royall, That was cast out of a bochers stall. But how euer he was borne, Men wolde haue the lesse scorne, If he coulde consyder His byrth and rowme togeder, And call to his mynde How noble and how kynde To him he hathe founde Our souereyne lorde, chyfe grounde Of all this prelacy, And set hym nobly In great auctoryte, Out from a low degre, Whiche he can nat se: For he was parde No doctor of deuinyte, Nor doctor of the law, Nor of none other saw; But a poore maister of arte, God wot, had lytell parte Of the quatriuials, Nor yet of triuialis, Nor of philosophy, Nor of philology, Nor of good pollycy, Nor of astronomy, Nor acquaynted worth a fly With honorable Haly, Nor with royall Ptholomy, Nor with Albumasar, To treate of any star Fyxt or els mobyll; His Latyne tonge dothe hobbyll, He doth but cloute and cobbill In Tullis faculte, Called humanyte; Yet proudly he dare pretende How no man can him amende: But haue ye nat harde this, How an one eyed man is Well syghted when He is amonge blynde men? Than, our processe for to stable, This man was full vnable To reche to suche degre, Had nat our prynce be Royall Henry the eyght, Take him in suche conceyght, That he set him on heyght, In exemplyfyenge Great Alexander the kynge, In writynge as we fynde; Whiche of his royall mynde, And of his noble pleasure, Transcendynge out of mesure, Thought to do a thynge That perteyneth to a kynge, To make vp one of nought, And made to him be brought A wretched poore man, Whiche his lyuenge wan With plantyng of lekes By the dayes and by the wekes, And of this poore vassall He made a kynge royall, And gaue him a realme to rule, That occupyed a showell, A mattoke, and a spade, Before that he was made A kynge, as I haue tolde, And ruled as he wolde. Suche is a kynges power, To make within an hower, And worke suche a myracle, That shall be a spectacle Of renowme and worldly fame: In lykewyse now the same Cardynall is promoted, Yet with lewde condicyons cotyd, As herafter ben notyd, Presumcyon and vayne glory, Enuy, wrath, and lechery, Couetys and glotony, Slouthfull to do good, Now frantick, now starke wode. Shulde this man of suche mode Rule the swerde of myght, How can he do ryght? For he wyll as sone smyght His frende as his fo; A prouerbe longe ago. Set vp a wretche on hye In a trone triumphantlye, Make him a great astate, And he wyll play checke mate With ryall maieste, Counte him selfe as good as he; A prelate potencyall, To rule vnder Bellyall, As ferce and as cruell As the fynd of hell. His seruauntes menyall He dothe reuyle, and brall, Lyke Mahounde in a play; No man dare him withsay: He hath dispyght and scorne At them that be well borne; He rebukes them and rayles, Ye horsons, ye vassayles, Ye knaues, ye churles sonnys, Ye rebads, nat worth two plummis, Ye raynbetyn beggers reiagged, Ye recrayed ruffyns all ragged! With, stowpe, thou hauell, Rynne, thou iauell! Thou peuysshe pye pecked, Thou losell longe necked! Thus dayly they be decked, Taunted and checked, That they ar so wo, That wot not whether to go. No man dare come to the speche Of this gentell Iacke breche, Of what estate he be, Of spirituall dygnyte, Nor duke of hye degre, Nor marques, erle, nor lorde; Whiche shrewdly doth accorde, Thus he borne so base All noble men shulde out face, His countynaunce lyke a kayser. My lorde is nat at layser; Syr, ye must tary a stounde, Tyll better layser be founde; And, syr, ye must daunce attendaunce, And take pacient sufferaunce, For my lordes grace Hath nowe no tyme nor space To speke with you as yet. And thus they shall syt, Chuse them syt or flyt, Stande, walke, or ryde, And his layser abyde Parchaunce halfe a yere, And yet neuer the nere. This daungerous dowsypere, Lyke a kynges pere; And within this xvi. yere He wolde haue ben ryght fayne To haue ben a chapleyne, And haue taken ryght gret payne With a poore knyght, What soeuer he hyght. The chefe of his owne counsell, They can nat well tell Whan they with hym shulde mell, He is so fyers and fell; He rayles and he ratis, He calleth them doddypatis; He grynnes and he gapis, As it were iack napis. Suche a madde bedleme For to rewle this reame, It is a wonders case: That the kynges grace Is toward him so mynded, And so farre blynded, That he can nat parceyue How he doth hym disceyue, I dought, lest by sorsery, Or suche other loselry, As wychecraft, or charmyng; For he is the kynges derlyng, And his swete hart rote, And is gouerned by this mad kote: For what is a man the better For the kynges letter? For he wyll tere it asonder; Wherat moche I wonder, Howe suche a hoddypoule So boldely dare controule, And so malapertly withstande The kynges owne hande, And settys nat by it a myte; He sayth the kynge doth wryte And writeth he wottith nat what; And yet for all that, The kynge his clemency Despensyth with his demensy. But what his grace doth thinke, I haue no pen nor inke That therwith can mell; But wele I can tell How Frauncis Petrarke, That moche noble clerke, Wryteth how Charlemayn Coude nat him selfe refrayne, But was rauysht with a rage Of a lyke dotage: But how that came aboute, Rede ye the story oute, And ye shall fynde surely It was by nycromansy, By carectes and coniuracyon, Vnder a certeyne constellacion, And a certayne fumygacion, Vnder a stone on a golde ryng, Wrought to Charlemayn the king, Whiche constrayned him forcebly For to loue a certayne body Aboue all other inordinatly. This is no fable nor no lye; At Acon it was brought to pas, As by myne auctor tried it was. But let mi masters mathematical Tell you the rest, for me they shal; They haue the full intellygence, And dare vse the experyens, In there obsolute consciens To practyue suche abolete sciens; For I abhore to smatter Of one so deuyllysshe a matter. But I wyll make further relacion Of this isagogicall colation, How maister Gaguine, the crownycler Of the feytis of war That were done in Fraunce, Maketh remembraunce, How Kynge Lewes of late Made vp a great astate Of a poore wretchid man, Wherof moche care began. Iohannes Balua was his name, Myne auctor writeth the same; Promoted was he To a cardynalles dygnyte By Lewes the kyng aforesayd, With hym so wele apayd, That he made him his chauncelar To make all or to mar, And to rule as him lyst, Tyll he cheked at the fyst, And agayne all reason Commyted open trayson And against his lorde souerayn; Wherfore he suffred payn, Was hedyd, drawen, and quarterd, And dyed stynkingly marterd. Lo, yet for all that He ware a cardynals hat, In hym was small fayth, As myne auctor sayth: Nat for that I mene Suche a casuelte shulde be sene, Or suche chaunce shulde fall Vnto our cardynall. Allmyghty God, I trust, Hath for him dyscust That of force he must Be faythfull, trew, and iust To our most royall kynge, Chefe rote of his makynge; Yet it is a wyly mouse That can bylde his dwellinge house Within the cattes eare Withouten drede or feare. It is a nyce reconynge, To put all the gouernynge, All the rule of this lande Into one mannys hande: One wyse mannys hede May stande somwhat in stede; But the wyttys of many wyse Moche better can deuyse, By theyr cyrcumspection, And theyr sad dyrrection, To cause the commune weale Longe to endure in heale. Christ kepe King Henry the eyght From trechery and dysceyght, And graunt him grace to know The faucon from the crow, The wolfe from the lam, From whens that mastyfe cam! Let him neuer confounde The gentyll greyhownde: Of this matter the grownde Is easy to expounde, And soone may be perceyued, How the worlde is conueyed. But harke, my frende, one worde In ernest or in borde: Tell me nowe in this stede Is maister Mewtas dede, The kynges Frenche secretary, And his vntrew aduersary? For he sent in writynge To Fraunces the French kyng Of our maisters counsel in eueri thing: That was a peryllous rekenyng!— Nay, nay, he is nat dede; But he was so payned in the hede, That he shall neuer ete more bred. Now he is gone to another stede, With a bull vnder lead, By way of commissyon, To a straunge iurisdictyon, Called Dymingis Dale, Farre byyonde Portyngale, And hathe his pasport to pas Ultra Sauromatas, To the deuyll, syr Sathanas, To Pluto, and syr Bellyall, The deuyls vycare generall, And to his college conuentuall, As well calodemonyall As to cacodemonyall, To puruey for our cardynall A palace pontifycall, To kepe his court prouyncyall, Vpon artycles iudicyall, To contende and to stryue For his prerogatyue, Within that consystory To make sommons peremtory Before some prothonotory Imperyall or papall. Vpon this matter mistycall I haue tolde you part, but nat all: Herafter perchaunce I shall Make a larger memoryall, And a further rehersall, And more paper I thinke to blot, To the court why I cam not; Desyring you aboue all thynge To kepe you from laughynge Whan ye fall to redynge Of this wanton scrowle, And pray for Mewtas sowle, For he is well past and gone; That wolde God euerychone Of his affynyte Were gone as well as he! Amen, amen, say ye, Of your inward charyte; Amen, Of your inward charyte. It were great rewth, For wrytynge of trewth Any man shulde be In perplexyte Of dyspleasure; For I make you sure, Where trouth is abhorde, It is a playne recorde That there wantys grace; In whose place Dothe occupy, Full vngracyously, Fals flatery, Fals trechery, Fals brybery, Subtyle Sym Sly, With madde foly; For who can best lye, He is best set by. Than farewell to thé, Welthfull felycite! For prosperyte Away than wyll fle. Than must we agre With pouerte; For mysery, With penury, Myserably And wretchydly Hath made askrye And outcry, Folowynge the chase To dryue away grace. Yet sayst thou percase, We can lacke no grace, For my lordes grace, And my ladies grace, With trey duse ase, And ase in the face, Some haute and some base, Some daunce the trace Euer in one case: Marke me that chase In the tennys play, For synke quater trey Is a tall man: He rod, but we ran, Hay, the gye and the gan! The gray gose is no swan; The waters wax wan, And beggers they ban, And they cursed Datan, De tribu Dan, That this warke began, Palam et clam, With Balak and Balam, The golden ram Of Flemmyng dam, Sem, Iapheth, or Cam. But howe comme to pas, Your cupboard that was Is tourned to glasse, From syluer to brasse, From golde to pewter, Or els to a newter, To copper, to tyn, To lede, or alcumyn? A goldsmyth your mayre; But the chefe of your fayre Myght stande nowe by potters, And suche as sell trotters: Pytchars, potshordis, This shrewdly accordis To be a cupborde for lordys. My lorde now and syr knyght, Good euyn and good nyght! For now, syr Trestram, Ye must weare bukram, Or canues of Cane, For sylkes are wane. Our royals that shone, Our nobles are gone Amonge the Burgonyons, And Spanyardes onyons, And the Flanderkyns. Gyll swetis, and Cate spynnys, They are happy that wynnys; But Englande may well say, Fye on this wynnyng all way! Now nothynge but pay, pay, With, laughe and lay downe, Borowgh, cyte, and towne. Good Sprynge of Lanam Must counte what became Of his clothe makynge: He is at suche takynge, Though his purse wax dull, He must tax for his wull By nature of a newe writ; My lordys grace nameth it A quia non satisfacit: In the spyght of his tethe He must pay agayne A thousande or twayne Of his golde in store; And yet he payde before An hunderd pounde and more, Whiche pyncheth him sore. My lordis grace wyll brynge Downe this hye sprynge, And brynge it so lowe, It shall nat euer flowe. Suche a prelate, I trowe, Were worthy to rowe Thorow the streytes of Marock To the gybbet of Baldock: He wolde dry vp the stremys Of ix. kinges realmys, All ryuers and wellys, All waters that swellys; For with vs he so mellys That within Englande dwellys, I wolde he were somwhere ellys; For els by and by He wyll drynke vs so drye, And suck vs so nye, That men shall scantly Haue peny or halpeny. God saue his noble grace, And graunt him a place Endlesse to dwell With the deuyll of hell! For, and he were there, We nede neuer feere Of the fendys blake: For I vndertake He wolde so brag and crake, That he wolde than make The deuyls to quake, To shudder and to shake, Lyke a fyer drake, And with a cole rake Brose them on a brake, And bynde them to a stake, And set hell on fyer, At his owne desyer. He is suche a grym syer, And suche a potestolate, And suche a potestate, That he wolde breke the braynes Of Lucyfer in his chaynes, And rule them echone In Lucyfers trone. I wolde he were gone; For amonge vs is none That ruleth but he alone, Without all good reason, And all out of season: For Folam peason With him be nat geson; They growwe very ranke Vpon euery banke Of his herbers grene, With my lady bryght and shene; On theyr game it is sene They play nat all clene, And it be as I wene. But as touchynge dyscrecyon, With sober dyrectyon, He kepeth them in subiectyon: They can haue no protectyon To rule nor to guyde, But all must be tryde, And abyde the correctyon Of his wylfull affectyon. For as for wytte, The deuyll spede whitte! But braynsyk and braynlesse, Wytles and rechelesse, Careles and shamlesse, Thriftles and gracelesse, Together are bended And so condyscended, That the commune welth Shall neuer haue good helth, But tatterd and tuggyd, Raggyd and ruggyd, Shauyn and shorne, And all threde bare worne. Suche gredynesse Suche nedynesse, Myserablenesse, With wretchydnesse, Hath brought in dystresse And moche heuynesse And great dolowre Englande, the flowre Of relucent honowre, In olde commemoracion Most royall Englyssh nacion. Now all is out of facion, Almost in desolation; I speke by protestacion: God of his miseracyon Send better reformacyon! Lo, for to do shamfully He iugeth it no foly! But to wryte of his shame, He sayth we ar to blame. What a frensy is this, No shame to do amys, And yet he is ashamed To be shamfully named! And ofte prechours be blamed, Bycause they haue proclamed His madnesse by writynge, His symplenesse resytynge, Remordynge and bytynge, With chydyng and with flytynge, Shewynge him Goddis lawis: He calleth the prechours dawis, And of holy scriptures sawis He counteth them for gygawis, And putteth them to sylence And with wordis of vyolence, Lyke Pharao, voyde of grace, Dyd Moyses sore manase, And Aron sore he thret, The worde of God to let; This maumet in lyke wyse Against the churche doth ryse; The prechour he dothe dyspyse, With crakynge in suche wyse, So braggynge all with bost, That no prechour almost Dare speke for his lyfe Of my lordis grace nor his wyfe, For he hath suche a bull, He may take whom he wull, And as many as him lykys; May ete pigges in Lent for pikys, After the sectes of heretykis, For in Lent he wyll ete All maner of flesshe mete That he can ony where gete; With other abusyons grete, Wherof for to trete It wolde make the deuyll to swete, For all priuileged places He brekes and defaces, All placis of relygion He hathe them in derisyon, And makith suche prouisyon To dryue them at diuisyon, And fynally in conclusyon To bringe them to confusyon; Saint Albons to recorde Wherof this vngracyous lorde Hathe made him selfe abbot, Against their wylles, God wot. All this he dothe deale Vnder strength of the great seale, And by his legacy, Whiche madly he dothe apply Vnto an extrauagancy Pyked out of all good lawe, With reasons that ben rawe. Yet, whan he toke first his hat, He said he knew what was what; All iustyce he pretended, All thynges sholde be amended, All wronges he wolde redresse, All iniuris he wolde represse, All periuris he wolde oppresse; And yet this gracelesse elfe, He is periured himselfe, As playnly it dothe appere, Who lyst to enquere In the regestry Of my Lorde of Cantorbury, To whom he was professed In thre poyntes expressed; The fyrst to do him reuerence, The seconde to owe hym obedyence, The thirde with hole affectyon To be vnder his subiectyon: But now he maketh obiectyon, Vnder the protectyon Of the kynges great seale, That he setteth neuer a deale By his former othe, Whether God be pleased or wroth. He makith so proude pretens, That in his equipolens He iugyth him equiualent With God omnipotent: But yet beware the rod, And the stroke of God! The Apostyll Peter Had a pore myter And a poore cope Whan he was creat Pope, First in Antioche; He dyd neuer approche Of Rome to the see Weth suche dygnyte. Saynt Dunstane, what was he? Nothynge, he sayth, lyke to me: There is a dyuersyte Bytwene him and me; We passe hym in degre, As legatus a latere. Ecce, sacerdos magnus, That wyll hed vs and hange vs, And streitly strangle vs And he may fange vs! Decre and decretall, Constytucyon prouincyall, Nor no lawe canonicall, Shall let the preest pontyficall To syt in causa sanguinis. Nowe God amende that is amys! For I suppose that he is Of Ieremy the whyskynge rod, The flayle, the scourge of almighty God. This Naman Sirus, So fell and so irous, So full of malencoly, With a flap afore his eye, Men wene that he is pocky, Or els his surgions they lye, For, as far as they can spy By the craft of surgery, It is manus Domini. And yet this proude Antiochus, He is so ambicious, So elate, and so vicious, And so cruell hertyd, That he wyll nat be conuertyd; For he setteth God apart, He is nowe so ouerthwart, And so payned with pangis, That all his trust hangis In Balthasor, whiche heled Domingos nose that was wheled; That Lumberdes nose meane I, That standeth yet awrye; It was nat heled alderbest, It standeth somwhat on the west; I meane Domyngo Lomelyn, That was wont to wyn Moche money of the kynge At the cardys and haserdynge: Balthasor, that helyd Domingos nose From the puskylde pocky pose, Now with his gummys of Araby Hath promised to hele our cardinals eye; Yet sum surgions put a dout, Lest he wyll put it clene out, And make him lame of his neder limmes: God sende him sorowe for his sinnes! Some men myght aske a question, By whose suggestyon I toke on hand this warke, Thus boldly for to barke? And men lyst to harke, And my wordes marke, I wyll answere lyke a clerke; For trewly and vnfayned, I am forcebly constrayned, At Iuuynals request, To wryght of this glorious gest, Of this vayne gloryous best, His fame to be encrest At euery solempne feest; Quia difficile est Satiram non scribere. Now, mayster doctor, howe say ye, What soeuer your name be? What though ye be namelesse, Ye shall not escape blamelesse, Nor yet shall scape shamlesse: Mayster doctor in your degre, Yourselfe madly ye ouerse; Blame Iuuinall, and blame nat me: Maister doctor Diricum, Omne animi vitium, &amp;c. As Iuuinall dothe recorde, A small defaute in a great lorde, A lytell cryme in a great astate, Is moche more inordinate, And more horyble to beholde, Than any other a thousand folde. Ye put to blame ye wot nere whom; Ye may weare a cockes come; Your fonde hed in your furred hood, Holde ye your tong, ye can no goode: And at more conuenyent tyme I may fortune for to ryme Somwhat of your madnesse; For small is your sadnesse To put any man in lack, And say yll behynde his back: And my wordes marke truly, That ye can nat byde thereby, For smegma non est cinnamomum, But de absentibus nil nisi bonum. Complayne, or do what ye wyll, Of your complaynt it shall nat skyl: This is the tenor of my byl, A daucock ye be, and so shalbe styll.

SKELTON, LAUREATE, &amp;c HOWE THE DOUTY DUKE OF ALBANY, LYKE A COWARDE KNYGHT, RAN AWAYE SHAMFULLY, WITH AN HUNDRED THOUSANDE TRATLANDE SCOTTES AND FAINT HARTED FRENCHEMEN, BESIDE THE WATER OF TWEDE, &amp;c. Reioyse, Englande, And vnderstande These tidinges newe, Whiche be as trewe As the gospell: This duke so fell Of Albany, So cowardly, With all his hoost Of the Scottyshe coost, For all theyr boost, Fledde lyke a beest; Wherfore to ieste Is my delyght Of this cowarde knyght, And for to wright In the dispyght Of the Scottes ranke Of Huntley banke, Of Lowdyan, Of Locryan, And the ragged ray Of Galaway. Dunbar, Dunde, Ye shall trowe me, False Scottes are ye: Your hartes sore faynted, And so attaynted, Lyke cowardes starke, At the castell of Warke, By the water of Twede, Ye had euill spede; Lyke cankerd curres, Ye loste your spurres, For in that fraye Ye ranne awaye, With, hey, dogge, hay! For Sir William Lyle Within shorte whyle, That valiaunt knyght, Putte you to flyght; By his valyaunce Two thousande of Fraunce There he putte backe, To your great lacke, And vtter shame Of your Scottysshe name. Your chefe cheftayne, Voyde of all brayne, Duke of all Albany, Than shamefuly He reculed backe, To his great lacke, Whan he herde tell That my lorde amrell Was comyng downe, To make hym frowne And to make hym lowre, With the noble powre Of my lorde cardynall, As an hoost royall, After the auncient manner, With sainct Cutberdes banner, And sainct Williams also; Your capitayne ranne to go, To go, to go, to go, And brake vp all his hoost For all his crake and bost, Lyke a cowarde knyght, He fledde, and durst nat fyght, He ranne awaye by night. But now must I Your Duke ascry Of Albany With a worde or twayne In sentence playne. Ye duke so doutty, So sterne, so stoutty, In shorte sentens, Of your pretens What is the grounde, Breuely and rounde To me expounde, Or els wyll I Euydently Shewe as it is; For the cause is this, Howe ye pretende For to defende The yonge Scottyshe kyng, But ye meane a thyng, And ye coude bryng The matter about, To putte his eyes out And put hym downe, And set hys crowne On your owne heed Whan he were deed. Such trechery And traytory Is all your cast; Thus ye haue compast With the Frenche kyng A fals rekenyng To enuade Englande, As I vnderstande: But our kyng royall, Whose name ouer all, Noble Henry the eyght, Shall cast a beyght, And sette suche a snare, That shall cast you in care, Bothe Kyng Fraunces and thé, That knowen ye shall be For the moost recrayd Cowardes afrayd, And falsest forsworne, That euer were borne. O ye wretched Scottes, Ye puaunt pyspottes, It shalbe your lottes To be knytte vp with knottes Of halters and ropes About your traytours throtes! O Scottes pariured, Vnhaply vred, Ye may be assured Your falshod discured It is and shal be From the Scottish se Vnto Gabione! For ye be false echone, False and false agayne, Neuer true nor playne, But flery, flatter, and fayne, And euer to remayne In wretched beggary And maungy misery, In lousy lothsumnesse And scabbed scorffynesse, And in abhominacion Of all maner of nacion, Nacion moost in hate, Proude and poore of state. Twyt, Scot, go kepe thy den, Mell nat with Englyshe men; Thou dyd nothyng but barke At the castell of Warke. Twyt, Scot, yet agayne ones, We shall breke thy bones, And hang you vpon polles, And byrne you all to colles; With, twyt, Scot, twyt, Scot, twyt, Walke, Scot, go begge a byt Of brede at ylke mannes hecke: The fynde, Scot, breke thy necke! Twyt, Scot, agayne I saye, Twyt, Scot of Galaway, Twyt, Scot, shake thy dogge, hay! Twyt, Scot, thou ran away. We set nat a flye By your Duke of Albany; We set nat a prane By suche a dronken drane; We set nat a myght By suche a cowarde knyght, Suche a proude palyarde, Suche a skyrgaliarde, Suche a starke cowarde, Suche a proude pultrowne, Suche a foule coystrowne, Suche a doutty dagswayne; Sende him to F[r]aunce agayne, To bring with hym more brayne From Kynge Fraunces of Frauns: God sende them bothe myschauns! Ye Scottes all the rable, Ye shall neuer be hable With vs for to compare; What though ye stampe and stare? God sende you sorow and care! With vs whan euer ye mell, Yet we bear away the bell, Whan ye cankerd knaues Must crepe into your caues Your heedes for to hyde, For ye dare nat abyde. Sir Duke of Albany, Right inconuenyently Ye rage and ye raue, And your worshyp depraue: Nat lyke Duke Hamylcar, With the Romayns that made war, Nor lyke his sonne Hanyball, Nor lyke Duke Hasdruball Of Cartage in Aphrike; Yet somwhat ye be lyke In some of their condicions, And their false sedycions, And their dealyng double, And their weywarde trouble: But yet they were bolde, And manly manyfolde, Their enemyes to assayle In playn felde and battayle; But ye and your hoost, Full of bragge and boost, And full of waste wynde, Howe ye wyll beres bynde, And the deuill downe dynge, Yet ye dare do nothynge, But lepe away lyke frogges, And hyde you vnder logges, Lyke pygges and lyke hogges, And lyke maungy dogges. What an army were ye? Or what actyuyte Is in you, beggers braules, Full of scabbes and scaules, Of vermyne and of lyce, And of all maner vyce? Syr duke, nay, syr ducke, Syr drake of the lake, sir ducke Of the donghyll, for small lucke Ye haue in feates of warre; Ye make nought, but ye marre; Ye are a fals entrusar, And a fals abusar, And an vntrewe knyght; Thou hast to lytell myght Agaynst Englande to fyght; Thou art a graceles wyght To put thy selfe to flyght: A vengeaunce and dispight On thé must nedes lyght, That durst nat byde the sight Of my lorde amrell, Of chiualry the well, Of knighthode the floure In euery marciall shoure, The noble Erle of Surrey, That put thé in suche fray; Thou durst no felde derayne, Nor no batayle mayntayne Against our st[r]onge captaine, But thou ran home agayne, For feare thou shoulde be slayne, Lyke a Scottyshe keteryng, That durst abyde no reknyng; Thy hert wolde nat serue thé: The fynde of hell mot sterue thé! No man hath harde Of suche a cowarde, And such a mad ymage Caried in a cage, As it were a cotage; Or of suche a mawment Caryed in a tent; In a tent! nay, nay, But in a mountayne gay, Lyke a great-hill For a wyndmil, Therin to couche styll, That no man hym kyll; As it were a gote In a shepe cote, About hym a parke Of a madde warke, Men call it a toyle; Therin, lyke a royle, Sir Dunkan, ye dared, And thus ye prepared Youre carkas to kepe, Lyke a sely shepe, A shepe of Cottyswolde, From rayne and from colde, And from raynning of rappes, And suche after clappes; Thus in your cowardly castell Ye decte you to dwell: Suche a captayne of hors, It made no great fors If that ye had tane Your last deedly bane With a gon stone, To make you to grone. But hyde thé, sir Topias, Nowe into the castell of Bas, And lurke there, lyke an as, With some Scotyshe [l]as, With dugges, dugges, dugges: I shrewe thy Scottishe lugges, Thy munpynnys, and thy crag, For thou can not but brag, Lyke a Scottyshe hag: Adue nowe, sir Wrig wrag, Adue, sir Dalyrag! Thy mellyng is but mockyng; Thou mayst giue vp thy cocking, Gyue it vp, and cry creke, Lyke an huddypeke. Wherto shuld I more speke Of suche a farly freke, Of suche an horne keke, Of suche an bolde captayne, That dare nat turne agayne, Nor durst nat crak a worde, Nor durst nat drawe his swerde Agaynst the Lyon White, But ran away quyte? He ran away by nyght, In the owle flyght, Lyke a cowarde knyght. Adue, cowarde, adue, Fals knight, and mooste vntrue! I render thé, fals rebelle, To the flingande fende of helle. Harke yet, sir duke, a worde, In ernest or in borde: What, haue ye, villayn, forged, And virulently dysgorged, As though ye wolde parbrake, Your auauns to make, With wordes enbosed, Vngraciously engrosed, Howe ye wyll vndertake Our royall kyng to make His owne realme to forsake? Suche lewde langage ye spake. Sir Dunkan, in the deuill waye, Be well ware what ye say: Ye saye that he and ye,— Whyche he and ye? let se; Ye meane Fraunces, French kyng, Shulde bring about that thing. I say, thou lewde lurdayne, That neyther of you twayne So hardy nor so bolde His countenaunce to beholde: If our moost royall Harry Lyst with you to varry, Full soone ye should miscary, For ye durst nat tarry With hym to stryue a stownde; If he on you but frounde, Nat for a thousande pounde Ye durst byde on the grounde, Ye wolde ryn away rounde, And cowardly tourne your backes, For all your comly crackes, And, for feare par case To loke hym in the face, Ye wolde defoyle the place, And ryn your way apace. Thoughe I trym you thys trace With Englyshe somwhat base, Yet, saue voster grace, Therby I shall purchace No displesaunt rewarde, If ye wele can regarde Your cankarde cowardnesse And your shamfull doublenesse. Are ye nat frantyke madde, And wretchedly bestadde, To rayle agaynst his grace, That shall bring you full bace, And set you in suche case, That bytwene you twayne There shalbe drawen a trayne That shalbe to your payne? To flye ye shalbe fayne. And neuer tourne agayne. What, wold Fraunces, our friar, Be suche a false lyar, So madde a cordylar, So madde a murmurar? Ye muse somwhat to far; All out of ioynt ye iar: God let you neuer thriue! Wene ye, daucockes, to driue Our kyng out of his reme? Ge heme, ranke Scot, ge heme, With fonde Fraunces, French kyng: Our mayster shall you brynge I trust, to lowe estate, And mate you with chekmate. Your braynes arr ydell; It is time for you to brydell, And pype in a quibyble; For it is impossible For you to bring about, Our kyng for to dryue out Of this his realme royall And lande imperiall; So noble a prince as he In all actyuite Of hardy merciall actes, Fortunate in all his faytes. And nowe I wyll me dresse His valiaunce to expresse, Though insufficient am I His grace to magnify And laude equiualently; Howe be it, loyally, After myne allegyaunce, My pen I wyll auaunce To extoll his noble grace, In spyght of thy cowardes face, In spyght of Kyng Fraunces, Deuoyde of all nobles, Deuoyde of good corage, Deuoyde of wysdome sage, Mad, frantyke, and sauage; Thus he dothe disparage His blode with fonde dotage. A prince to play the page It is a rechelesse rage, And a lunatyke ouerage. What though my stile be rude? With trouthe it is ennewde: Trouth ought to be rescude, Trouthe should nat be subdude. But nowe will I expounde What noblenesse dothe abounde, And what honour is founde, And what vertues be resydent In our royall regent, Our perelesse president, Our kyng most excellent: In merciall prowes Lyke vnto Hercules; In prudence and wysdom Lyke vnto Salamon; In his goodly person Lyke vnto Absolon; In loyalte and foy Lyke to Ector of Troy; And his glory to incres, Lyke to Scipiades; In royal mageste Lyke vnto Ptholome, Lyke to Duke Iosue, And the valiaunt Machube; That if I wolde reporte All the roiall sorte Of his nobilyte, His magnanymyte, His animosite, His frugalite, His lyberalite, His affabilite, His humanyte, His stabilite, His humilite, His benignite, His royall dignyte, My lernyng is to small For to recount them all. What losels than are ye, Lyke cowardes as ye be, To rayle on his astate, With wordes inordinate! He rules his cominalte With all benignite; His noble baronage, He putteth them in corage To exployte dedes of armys, To the domage and harmys Of suche as be his foos; Where euer he rydes or goos, His subiectes he dothe supporte, Maintayne them with comforte Of his moste princely porte, As all men can reporte. Than ye be a knappishe sorte, Et faitez a luy grant torte, With your enbosed iawes To rayle on hym lyke dawes; The fende scrache out your mawes! All his subiectes and he Moost louyngly agre With hole hart and true mynde, They fynde his grace so kynde; Wherwith he dothe them bynde At all houres to be redy With hym to lyue and dye, And to spende their hart blode, Their bodyes and their gode, With hym in all dystresse, Alway in redynesse To assyst his noble grace; In spyght of thy cowardes face, Moost false attaynted traytour, And false forsworne faytour. Auaunte, cowarde recrayed! Thy pride shalbe alayd; With sir Fraunces of Fraunce We shall pype you a daunce, Shall tourne you to myschauns. I rede you, loke about; For ye shalbe driuen out Of your lande in shorte space: We will so folowe in the chace, That ye shall haue no grace For to tourne your face; And thus, Sainct George to borowe, Ye shall haue shame and sorowe. Lenuoy. Go, lytell quayre, quickly; Shew them that shall you rede, How that ye are lykely Ouer all the worlde to sprede. The fals Scottes for dred, With the Duke of Albany, Beside the water of Twede They fledde full cowardly. Though your Englishe be rude, Barreyne of eloquence, Yet, breuely to conclude, Grounded is your sentence On trouthe, vnder defence Of all trewe Englyshemen, This mater to credence That I wrate with my pen.

But nowe what remedye? he is vncouerable, Touchyd by the handes of God that is moost just; But yet agayne a cause moost confortable We haue, wherin of ryght reioys we must, His sone on lyue in beaute, force, and lust, In honour lykely Traianus to shede; Wherfore in hym put we our hope and trust, Syth Henry his fader, alas, alas, lyeth dede! And nowe, for conclusyon, aboute his herse Let this be grauyd for endeles memorye, With sorowfull tunes of Thesyphenes verse; Here lyeth the puyssaunt and myghty Henry, Hector in batayll, Vlyxes in polecy, Salamon in wysdome, the noble rose rede, Creses in rychesse, Julyus in glory, Henry the Seuenth ingraued here lyeth dede!
