      <field name="fulltext">Vive La Chasse! “Image of war.” Somerville. Of Melton heedless, uninspired by Quorn, The note I sound is on a foreign horn; Across the Straits I cast a sportsman's glance, My theme to-day the hunting-fields of France. But though, as wont, in sporting phrase I write, The fields I sing to-day are fields of fight; The hounds I name are warriors of renown, And every cover is a fencèd town; The chase still prompts my figurative speech, I charge a “bullfinch” when I storm a breach; Whene'er, exulting o'er some glorious day, O'er country cross'd, or trophies borne away, Remember, reader, that I speak not then Of killing foxes, but of slaughtering men. Heroes and kings are mirror'd on the stage, Why should not sport enliven History's page? Through many an age the Masters of her chase, Or sprung from Valois or from Bourbon race; In turn uplifted, on the saddle sat The Fair, the Wise, the Affable, the Fat; Oft boundary squabbles, virulent as those Of modern masters, in the country rose; Some cared not for it, some were hunting-mad, The few were good ones, and the many bad; Poison would some into the trencher dip, Some used the knife too freely, some the whip; Throughout all countries still the fame resounds Of names recorded in her list of hounds; Two stand conspicuous blazon'd on the card, The brave Du Guesclin and the good Bayard; And when great Louis later held the horn, Some gallant hounds were in the kennel born; The lash, though, Condé needed now and then, A good and crafty hound was old Turenne. Then wild disorder in the kennel rose, All running riot wheresoe'er they chose; Then out of Revolutionist, a lot Of mongrel monsters Bonnet Rouge begot; Knee-deep they waded in a crimson flood, With mouths insatiate howling still for blood; Till o'er their Master, uttering shouts obscene, They cried “Who-whoop!” and dropp'd the guillotine. Then, keen for sport and powerful to command, A mighty Nimrod took the pack in hand; He Murat nurtured—hound as Rupert rash— And many another full of fire and dash; Kleber, Desaix, Dumouriez, Junot, Hoche, Sans peur were all, but not all sans reproche; Matchless on land, but when he took to water, There Nelson check'd him with defeat and slaughter; In field successful, till one sad blank day On Moscow's snow the pack death-stricken lay. The Belgian covers one fine day they drew, The meet that morning was at Waterloo; There Wellesley challenged their triumphant note, And English bulldogs seized them by the throat; While “Sauve qui peut!” the pack's retreating cry, From thousand tongues re-echoed through the sky. The Victor vanquish'd and himself entrapp'd, In grey surtout his folded arms he wrapp'd; A captive's collar round his neck they tied, Chain'd to a rock, whereon he groan'd and died. But little sport was in the kennel shown By eighteenth Louis, weighing eighteen stone; Then with tenth Charles came haughty Polignac, Who scorn'd to stoop, and so upset the pack; Then like a fox unearth'd, though nigh too late, Stole Louis Philippe through the Tuileries gate; And uprose one to fill th' Imperial gap, Whose model Master was his Uncle Nap; His cockpit Italy; for battle spurr'd, The Gallic Cock struck down the Austrian bird; Till kennel discipline at length grown slack, His hounds were mangled by the Berlin pack; When English soil a friendly refuge gave, There dwells a widow sorrowing o'er his grave. Then Thiers, a Master gifted with the knack, Reduced to order the discordant pack; Till whelps by “Socialist,” to riot prone, He strove to keep in place, so lost his own. Three rival masters!—till they settle which Shall rule the kennel, hounds are at a hitch; Say, will MacMahon keep the pack in play, And hunt the country in a quiet way? Or seek revenge, the kennel gates unbar, “Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war!” April, 1873. My Dentist. In childhood who my first array Of teeth pluck'd tenderly away, For teeth like dogs have each their day? My Dentist. Who when my first had run their race, And others had usurp'd their place, When overcrowded gave them space? My Dentist. Whether the cavities were slight, Or vast and deep, who stopp'd them tight, Then made their polish'd surface white? My Dentist. When void of bone a gap was seen, Who fix'd, the vacancy to screen, An artificial one between? My Dentist. Who, when ambitious to be first My horse fell headlong in the burst, Replaced the ivories dispersed? My Dentist. Who “Baily” left on parlour chair With leaf turn'd down to show me where Jack Russell's life was pictured there? My Dentist. Or reading in that doleful cell Whyte-Melville's verse, who knew full well Its charm would every pang dispel? My Dentist. Who lull'd with laughing gas my fear When conscious that a tug was near For man's endurance too severe? My Dentist. And, lastly, when infirm I grew, Who skilfully each relic drew, And framed for me a mouth-piece new? My Dentist. Lines Suggested by the Will of the late George Payne, Esq. Well ere his earthly race was run, Did Payne bequeath the plate he won, Won not by conquest on the course, By rider's skill nor speed of horse, A worthier prize which serves to tell, How friends and neighbours loved him well; A trophy such as they deserve Alone, who ne'er from Honour swerve. That gift entrusted to its care, The Shire which gave is now its heir, And long as Althorp's walls endure There treasured shall it rest secure, His name henceforth by this bequest Endear'd to many a future guest. On the Visit of the Empress of Austria to Kildare. February, 1879. At the wrongs she has borne from “Invasion” of yore, Well indeed may old Ireland feel sorry and sore; Invasion! that word she has cause to detest, 'Tis a word which brings grief to each Irishman's breast. When Cromwell came o'er with his puritan crew, And unsheath'd the long sword to cut papists in two; Far worse than long swords—which they faced without fear— Far worse the long sermons thrust into their ear. Then all who adhered to King James and his crown, Were by Dutchmen beleaguer'd in Limerick town; Some forced by the victor as exiles to roam, Some crush'd into penal submission at home. At length an invader more welcome comes o'er, And without opposition sets foot on the shore; No war trumpet sounds her approach to declare, 'Tis the horn's merry note that invites to Kildare. Ammunition she needs not, nor soldiers, nor arms, She comes, and she conquers at once by her charms; And the smile in her eye is sufficient alone To subdue their warm hearts and make Ireland her own. Save the Fox taking flight from his stronghold of gorse, No foe to pursue has her troop of light horse, No planting of cannon to batter the mound, She clears both the rampart and fosse at a bound. Home rule is a sport for the roughs of the land, But horse rule requires a more delicate hand; What home-ruler now would not loyally kiss The hand of a ruler so gentle as this! Whether blazon'd the banner with orange or green, Now united for once may all Ireland be seen; One and all to the field at her bidding will speed, And if able will follow wherever she lead. Who can rule a rash horse and can keep his head straight, Must be surely well fitted to govern the State; What queen on her throne can this empress excel, Who can sit with like grace on a saddle as well? A Love Chase. One day by a statue of Cupid beguiled, Forth wander'd a maiden in search of the child; In fancy she hoped a sweet infant to find, With a bow in his hand and a quiver behind. She knew the boy's shoulders were furnish'd with wings, So she sought the green wood, where the nightingale sings; The birds flutter'd round in the branches above, But in vain she look'd there for the pinions of Love. She wander'd along where the meadows were strown With the flowers and the verdure of hay yet unmown; Though the air was so fragant, the sunbeams so bright, There was nothing like Love, save the butterfly's flight. In a step that was seen through the forest to glide, She thought that one morn she his mother espied; Diana it proved, who her hunting horn blew, But who cared not for Love, nor his hiding-place knew. Then the maid when reminded whence Venus had sprung, To the ocean went down and thus plaintively sung: “O Venus, a sight of thy darling I crave, Bid him rise for one moment and float on the wave.” She watch'd the green billows, she watch'd the white foam, Unheeded her prayer, she went back to her home; She had vow'd ne'er again on a love chase to start, When Love came unbidden and knock'd at her heart. Uninvited he came whom so long she had sought, How unlike the sweet child she had imaged in thought; Then the boy whom ere vex'd by his tyrannous sway, She had wish'd for in vain, she in vain wish'd away. On the Death of the Prince Imperial. Kin to a Victor once the pride of France, Ill-fated Prince! no marvel such descent Fired thy young soul on glorious deeds intent, A chivalrous spirit thine inheritance. By savage foemen screening their advance To wash their spears that princely heart was rent, Death struck ere yet the morn of life was spent, Ere yet with laurel we had wreath'd thy lance. Though sorrowing deeply o'er thy brief career, In desolation weeping her lost son, Still more we sorrow o'er a mother's grief. Imperial exile! for the Cross borne here In Heaven hereafter may a Crown be won, Where only hearts so crush'd may find relief.</field>
