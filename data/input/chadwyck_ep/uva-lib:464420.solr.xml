No. 11914) This mythi William, Duke of Normandie, As bookis old make mencion, William Conqueror Bi iust title and bi his cheualrie, Maade kyng bi conquest of Brutis albion, Put out Harald, took possession, Bare his crowne ful xxj yeer, Buried at Cane; thus seith the Cronicler. Next in ordre bi succession, William Rufus, his sone, crowned Kyng; William Rufus Which to godward hadde no deuocion, Distroid chirches of new and old bildyng To make a forest plesaunt for huntyng; xiiij yeer bare his crowne in-deede; Buried at Wynchestir; the cronycle ye may reede. His brothir next, callid the first Herrye, Herre the first Was at London crowned, as I fynde, Whos brothir Robert, Duke of Normandie, Gan hym werrey, the cronycle makith mynde; Reconciled, al rancour sett behynde, Ful xxxv yeer, bi record of writyng, He Regned; buryed at Redyng. His cosyn Stephen, whan first Herry was deede, Stephen Toward ynglond gan to crosse his sail; Th'erchebisshop sett vpon his hed A riche crowne—beyng of his consail. xix yeer with sorwe and grete trauail He bare his crowne, had neuer reste; Att Feuersham lith buried in a chest. Herry the secunde, sonne of the Emperesse, Was crowned next—a full manli knyht, Herry þe ije As bookis old pleynli do expresse; This seid Herry bi froward force &amp; myht Slouh seynt Thomas for holy cherchis riht! Yeers xxxv Regned, as it is maade mynde, Atte Font-euerad Lith buried, as I fynde. Richard his sonne, Next bi succession, Richard the first First of that name, strong, hardy, &amp; notable, Was crowned Kyng; Callid Cuer de leon— With sarsyn heedis serued was at his table! Slayn at Gaylard, bi dethe lamentable— The space Regned fulli of ix yeer; His herte buried atte Rone the hih auter. Next Kyng Richard Regned his brothir Iohn, Kyng Iohn Afftir soone entrid into France; Lost al Ange and Normandie a-non, This Lond entirdited bi his gouernaunce. And as it is put in remembraunce, xviij yeer kyng of this Region; Lith atte Wercestre; deid of poison. Herry the thridde, his sone, of ix yeer Age Herry þe thridde Was atte Glocestre crowned, as I reede; Long werre he hadde with his baronage; Greteli dilited in Almosse deede. lvjti yeer he regned her in-deede; Buried att Westmenstre, bi record of writyng, Day of seynt Edmund, marter, maide &amp; kyng. Edward the First, With the shankis Long, Was aftir crowned, that was so good a knyht; Edward þe Firste Wan Scotland maugre the scottis strong, And al Walis despite of al ther myht. Duryng his liff meyntened trouthe &amp; riht; xxxvti yeer he was heer kyng; Lith att Westmenstre: this trouth &amp; no Lesyng. Edward His sone, callid Carnarvan, Svccedyng aftir, to make his alliaunce, Edward of Carnarvan As the cronycle weel reherse can, Weddid the douhtir of the Kyng of Fraunce; On Thomas Lancastre bi deth he took vengaunce; xix yeer heeld heer hes regalie; Buried atte Gloucestre, bookis specifie. The thridde Edward borne atte Wyndesore, Edwarde the iij Which in knyhthod hadde so grete a pris, Enheritour off Fraunce, Withoute more Bare in his Armys quarterle iij flourelys; And he gate Caleys bi his prudent deuys. Regned in ynglond lj yeer, Lith at Westmenstre; thus seith the Cronycler. Sone of prince Edward, Richard the seconde, Richard the ijd In whos tyme was pes &amp; gret plente, Weddid queen Anne of bewme, as it is founde, Isabell, aftir, of Fraunce—who list see. xxij yeer he regned her, pardee; Att Langley Buried first, so stood the cas, Aftir to Westmenstre Hys body caried was. Herry the iiijte next crowned, in certeyn, A famous knyht, and of grete semlynesse; Herry the iiijte From his exil whan he cam hom a-geyn, Traueilid aftir with werre and grete seknesse. xiiij yeer he regned in sothnesse; Lith at Canturbury in that holy place— God of his mercy do his soule grace! The fifte Herry, of knyhthode Lodesterre, Herry the vte Wise and ryht manly, pleynli to termyne, Riht fortunat, preeued in pes and werre, Gretely expert in marcial discipline, Able to stond among the worthy nyne; Regned x yeer, who-so liste haue rewarde, Lith at Westmenstre not far from seynt edwarde. The vjte Herry, Brouht forthe in alle vertu, Herry the vjte Bi iuste title borne bi enheritaunce, Afforne prouydyd bi grace of crist Iesu To weer too crownes in Ynglond &amp; Fraunce, To whom god hath goue souereyne suffisaunce Off vertuous liff, and chose hym for his knyht, Long to reioisshe and regne heer in his riht.

Sir Dauid þe bruse was at distance, when Edward þe baliolfe rade with his lance; þe north end of ingland teched him to daunce, when he was met on þe more with mekill mischance. Sir philip þe valayse may him noght avance; þe flowres þat faire war, er fallen in ffraunce. þe floures er now fallen, þat fers war and fell, A bare with his bataille has done þam to dwell. Sir dauid þe Bruse said he suld fonde to ride thurgh all ingland, wald he noght wonde; at þe west-minster hall suld his stedes stonde, whils oure king Edward war out of þe londe. bot now has sir dauid missed of his merkes, and philip þe valays, with all þaire grete clerkes. Sir philip þe valais, suth forto say, Sent vnto sir dauid and faire gan him pray; at ride thurgh ingland þaire fo-men to flay, and said none es at home to let hym þe way. none letes him þe way to wende whore he will, bot with schipherd staues fand he his fill. Fro philip þe valais was sir dauid sent, all ingland to win fro twede vnto trent. he broght mani berebag with bow redy bent; þai robbed and þai reued and held þat þai hent. it was in þe waniand þat þai furth went; for couaitise of cataile þo schrewes war schent. Schent war þo schrewes, and ailed vnsele, for at þe neuil cros nedes bud þam knele. At þe Erchbisschop of ?ork now will I bigyn, for he may with his right hand assoyl vs of syn. both Dorem and Carlele þai wald neuer blin þe wirschip of ingland with wappen to win. Mekill wirschip þai wan, and wele haue þai waken, for syr dauid þe Bruse was in þat tyme taken. When Sir Dauid þe Bruse satt on his stede, he said of all ingland haued he no drede; bot hinde Iohn of Coupland, a wight man in wede, talked to Dauid and kend him his crede. þare was sir dauid, so dughty in his dede, þe faire toure of londen haued he to mede. Sone þan was sir dauid broght vnto þe toure, and william þe dowglas with men of honowre. full swith redy seruis fand þai þare a schowre; for first þai drank of þe swete, and seþin of þe sowre. þan Sir dauid þe Bruse makes his mone, þe faire coroun of scotland haues he forgone: he luked furth into france, help had he none, of sir philip þe valais ne ?it of sir Iohn. Þe pride of sir Dauid bigon fast to slaken, for he wakkind þe were þat held him-self waken. for philyp þe valaise had he brede baken, and in þe toure of londen his ines er taken. to be both in a place þaire forward þai nomen; bot philip fayled þare, and dauid es cumen. Sir Dauid þe bruse on þis manere said vnto sir philip, al þir sawes þus sere: “Philip þe valais, þou made me be here, þis es noght þe forward we made are to-?ere. ffals es þi forward, and euyll mot þou fare, for þou and sir Iohn þi son haues kast me in care.” Þe Scottes, with þaire falshede, þus went þai obout for to win Ingland whils Edward was out. for Cuthbert of dorem haued þai no dout; þarfore at neuel cros law gan þai lout. þare louted þai law, and leued allane. þus was dauid þe Bruse into þe toure tane. 11. THE SIEGE OF CALAIS (1347) BY LAURENCE MINOT Cotton MS. Galba E.ix How Edward, als þe romance sais, held his sege bifor Calais. Calays men, now mai ?e care, and murning mun ?e haue to mede; mirth on mold get ?e no mare, sir Edward sall ken ?ow ?owre crede. whilum war ?e wight in wede, to robbing rathly for to ren; mend ?ow sone of ?owre misdede; ?owre care es cumen, will ?e it ken. Kend it es how ?e war kene al inglis men with dole to dere; þaire gudes toke ?e al bidene, no man born wald ?e forbere. ?e spared noght with swerd ne spere to stik þam and þaire gudes to stele. with wapin and with ded of were þus haue ?e wonnen werldes wele. Weleful men war ?e, I-wis, bot fer on fold sall ?e noght fare. A bare sal now abate ?owre blis, and wirk ?ow bale on bankes bare. he sall ?ow hunt als hund does hare, þat in no hole sall ?e ?ow hide. for all ?owre speche will he noght spare, bot bigges him right by ?owre side. Biside ?ow here þe bare bigins to big his boure in winter tyde; and all bi-tyme takes he his ines with semly sergantes him biside. þe word of him walkes ful wide; Ihesu, saue him fro mischance! In bataill dar he wele habide sir philip and sir Iohn of france. Þe franche men er fers and fell, and mase grete dray when þai er dight; of þam men herd slike tales tell, with Edward think þai forto fight; him for to hald out of his right, and do him treson with þaire tales— þat was þaire purpos, day and night, bi counsail of þe Cardinales. Cardinales with hattes rede War fro calays wele thre myle; þai toke þaire counsail in þat stede, how þai might sir Edward bigile. þai lended þare bot litill while, till franche men to grante þaire grace; sir philip was funden a file, he fled and faght noght in þat place. In þat place þe bare was blith, for all was funden þat he had soght; philip þe valas fled ful swith, with þe batail þat he had broght. for to haue Calays had he thoght all at his ledeing loud or still; bot all þaire wiles war for noght, Edward wan it at his will. Lystens now, and ?e may lere, als men þe suth may vnderstand; þe knightes þat in Calais were come to sir Edward sare wepeand, in kirtell one, and swerd in hand, and cried, “sir Edward, þine are, do now, lord, bi law of land þi will with vs for euermare.” þe nobill burgase and þe best come vnto him to haue þaire hire; þe comun puple war ful prest rapes to bring obout þaire swire. þai said all, “sir philip, oure syre, and his sun, sir Iohn of france, has left vs ligand in þe mire, and broght vs till þis doleful dance. “oure horses, þat were faire and fat, er etin vp ilkone bidene; haue we nowþer conig ne cat, þat þai ne er etin, and hundes kene. all er etin vp ful clene, es nowther leuid biche ne whelp; þat es wele on oure sembland sene, And þai er fled þat suld vs help.” A knight þat was of grete renowne, Sir iohn de viene was his name, he was wardaine of þe toune, and had done ingland mekill schame. for all þaire boste þai er to blame, ful stalworthly þare haue þai streuyn. a bare es cumen to mak þam tame, kayes of þe toun to him er gifen. þe kaies er ?olden him of þe ?ate, lat him now kepe þam if he kun; to Calais cum þai all to late, sir philip and sir Iohn his sun. al war ful ferd þat þare ware fun; þaire leders may þai barely ban. all on þis wise was Calais won; god saue þam þat it so-gat wan. 12. THE TAKING OF GUINES (1352) BY LAURENCE MINOT Cotton MS. Galba E.ix How gentill sir Edward, with his grete engines, wan with his wight men þe Castell of Gynes. War þis winter oway, wele wald I wene þat somer suld schew him in schawes ful schene; both þe lely and þe lipard suld geder on a grene. Mari, haue minde of þi man, þou whote wham I mene. lady, think what I mene, I mak þe my mone; þou wreke gude king Edward on wikked syr Iohn. Of Gynes ful gladly now will I bigin; We wote wele þat woning was wikked forto win. crist, þat swelt on þe rode for sake of mans syn, hald þam in gude hele þat now er þarein. Inglis men er þarein, þe kastell to kepe; And Iohn of france es so wroth, for wo will he wepe. Gentil Iohn of Doncaster did a ful balde dede, when he come toward Gines to ken þam þaire Crede; he stirt vnto þe castell with-owten any stede, of folk þat he fand þare haued he no drede. Dred in hert had he none of all he fand þare; faine war þai to fle, for all þaire grete fare. A letherin ledderr, and a lang line, a small bote was þarby þat put þam fro pine; þe folk þat þai fand þare was faine forto fyne; sone þaire diner was dight, and þare wald þai dine. þare was þaire purpose to dine and to dwell, for treson of þe franche men þat fals war and fell. Say now, sir Iohn of france, how saltou fare, þat both Calays and Gynes has kindeld þi care? if þou be man of mekil might, lepe up on þi mare, Take þi gate vnto Gines, and grete þam wele þare. þare gretes þi gestes, and wendes with wo. king Edward has wonen þe kastell þam fro. ?e men of Saint Omers, trus ?e þis tide, and puttes out ?owre pauiliownes with ?owre mekill pride. sendes efter sir iohn of fraunce to stand by ?owre syde; a bore es boun ?ow to biker, þat wele dar habyde. Wele dar he habide, bataile to bede, and of ?owre sir iohn of fraunce haues he no drede. God saue sir Edward his right in euer ilka nede; and he þat will noght so, euil mot he spede! and len oure sir Edward his life wele to lede, þat he may at his ending haue heuin till his mede. Amen. POEMS FROM DIGBY MS. 102 13. WHAT PROFITS A KINGDOM (1401) MS. Digby 102 (Sum. Cat. No. 1703) ffor drede ofte my lippes y steke, ffor false reportours that trouhte mys-famed. ?ut Charitee chargeth me to speke; þou? trouþe be dred, he nys not ashamed. Trouþe secheþ non hernes ther los is lamed; Trouþe is worschiped at euery des. In that kyngdom ther trouþe is blamed, God sendes vengeaunce to make trouþe haue pes. Trouþe is messager to ry?t, And ry?t is counseille to Iustice; Iustice in goddis stede is dy?t. Do euene lawe to fooll &amp; wyse; Set mesure in euene assise, The ri?te weye as lawe ges. And lawe be kept, folk nyl not ryse— That kyngdom shal haue reste &amp; pes. ?if suche a tale-tellere were To a kyng apayre a mannys name, The kyng shulde boþe partyes here, And punysche þe fals for defame. þan fals men wolde ases for blame; for falshed, body &amp; soule it sles. ffalshed endes ay in shame; and trouþe, in worschipe &amp; in pes. Whanne lawe is put fro ri?t assise, And domes-man made by mede, ffor fawte of lawe ?if comouns rise, þan is a kyngdom most in drede. ffor whane vengeaunce a comouns lede, þei do gret harm er þey asses. There no man oþer doþ mysbede, That kyngdom shal haue reste &amp; pes. Whan craft riseþ a?ens craft, In burgh, toun, or citee, þey go to lordes whan lawe is laft, Whoche party may strengere be. But wyse men þe sonere se By witles wille þey gedre pres. Or lordis medle in foly degre, Let lawe haue cours in reste &amp; pes. ?it þere is þe þridde distaunce Bryngeþ a kyngdom in moche noy?e: Ofte chaunge of gouernaunce Of all degre, lowe &amp; hy?e. A kyng may not al aspie: Summe telle hym soþ, summe telle hym les. þe whete fro þe chaf ?e try?e, So mowe ?e leue in reste &amp; pes. I speke not in specyale Of oo kyngdom the lawe to telle, I speke hool in generale In eche kyngdom the lawe to telle. Also is writen in þe gospelle, A word þat god hym-seluen ches: Raþere þan fi?te, a man go selle On of his cloþes, &amp; bi?e hym pes. A worþi kny?t wol worchip wynne; He wil not ?elde hym þou? me þret. But raþere, as Malice doþ begynne, Quenche hit at þe firste het. ffor and ?e lete it growe gret, Hit brenneþ breme as fyre in gres. Laweles nouellerye loke ?e lete, So mowe ?e lyue in reste &amp; pes. Old speche is spoken ?ore, What is a kyngdom tresory? Bestayle, corn stuffed in store; Riche comouns, &amp; wyse clergy; Marchaundes, squyers, chiualry, That wol be redy at a res; And cheualrous kyng in wittes hy?e, To lede in were and gouerne in pes. Among philosofres wyse, In here bokes men writen fynde þat synne is cause of cowardyse; Wel-lyuyng man, hardy of kynde; Wikked lyuere, graceles, blynde, He dredeþ deþ, þe laste mes. þe good lyuere haþ god in mynde; þat mannys counseil makeþ pes. What kyng that wol haue good name, He wol be lad by wys counsayle, þat loue worschip &amp; dreden shame, And boldely dar fende &amp; assayle. þere wit is, corage may not fayle, ffor wysdom neuere worschip les. Corage in querell doþ batayle, And ende of batayle begynneþ pes. Defaute of wit makeþ long counsayle; ffor witteles wordes in ydel spoken, þe more cost, þe lesse auayle; ffor fawte of wyt, purpos broken. In euyl soule no grace is stoken, ffor wikked soule is graceles. In good lyuere goddis wille is loken; þat mannys counsell makeþ pes. To wete ?if parlement be wys, þe comoun profit wel it preues. A kyngdom in comouns lys— Alle profytes, &amp; alle myscheues. Lordis wet neuere what comouns greues, Til here rentis bigynne to ses. þere lordis ere pore, comons releues, And mayntene hem in werre &amp; pes. Make god ?oure ful frend; Do þe comaundement þat he bede. þou? all þe world a?en ?ow wend, Be god ?oure frend, ?e thar not drede. ffor þere-as god his frendis lede, He saueþ hem boþe on lond &amp; sees, Who-so fi?teþ, god doþ þe dede, ffor god is victorie &amp; pes. What kyngdom werreþ hym-self wiþ-ynne, Distroyeþ hym-self, and no mo. Wiþ-oute, here enemys bygynne On eche a syde assayle hem so. þe comouns, þey wil robbe &amp; slo, Make fyere, and kyndel stres. Whan ryches &amp; manhode is wastede &amp; go, þan drede dryueþ to trete pes. The world is like a fals lemman— ffayre semblaunt &amp; moche gyle. Wiþouten heire dyeþ no man; God is chief lord of toun &amp; pyle. God makeþ mony heire in a whyle, ffor god ressayueþ eche reles; God kan breke hegge &amp; style, And make an hey wey to pes. God made lordis gouernoures To gouerne puple in vnyte. þe puple, ne ryches, nys not ?oures: Al is goddis, &amp; so be ?e. Eche day ?e may ?oure myrrour se. Eche man after oþer deses; ?oure auncetres arn gon, after shal ?e, To endeles werre or endeless pes. Eche kyng is sworn to gouernaunce, To gouerne goddis puple in ri?t. Eche kyng bereþ swerd of goddis vengeaunce To felle goddis foon in fi?t. And so doþ euerons honest kny?t That bereþ þe ordre as it wes. The plough, þe chirche to mayntene ry?t, Are goddis champyons to kepe þe pes. The world is like a chery fayre, Ofte chaungeþ all his þynges. Riche, pore, foul, &amp; fayre, Popes, prelates, &amp; lordynges, Alle are dedly, and so ben kynges. Or deþ lede ?ow in his les, Arraye by-tyme ?oure rekenynges, And trete wiþ god to gete ?ow pes. What bryngeþ a kyngdom al aboue? Wys counseil, and good gouernaunce; Eche lord wil other loue, And rule wel labourrers sustynaunce. God makeþ for his frendis no destaunce, ffor god kan skatre þe grete pres. God for his frendis maþ ordynaunce, And gouerneþ hem in werre &amp; pes. Good lyf is cause of good name; Good name is worthi to haue reueraunce. Synne is cause of greuaunce. Eche kyngdom hongeþ in goddis balaunce; Wiþ hym þat holdeþ, wiþ hym þat fles. ?e haue fre wille, chese ?oure chaunce To haue wiþ god werre or pes. 14. GOD SAVE KING HENRY V (1413) Digby MS. 102 (Sum. Cat. No. 1703) God kepe oure kyng, and saue the croun! Glade in god, call hom ?oure herte, In ioye &amp; blisse ?oure merþe encres, And kepe goddis lawe in querte. Þes holy tyme, lete sorwe ases. Among oure-self, god sende vs pes. Þerto eche man be boun: To letten fooles of here res, Stonde wiþ þo kyng, mayntene þe croun. What doþ a kynges crowne signyfye, Whan stones &amp; floures on sercle is bent? Lordis, comouns, &amp; clergye To ben all at on assent. To kepe þat crowne, take good tent, In wode, in feld, in dale, &amp; downe. Þe leste lyge-man, wiþ body &amp; rent, He is a parcel of þe crowne. What signyfyeþ þo stones aboute? Richesse, strengþe, &amp; gret bounte. Oure townes &amp; castels, þo reme wiþ-oute, Þey are oure stones of gret pouste. In pes þey kepe all þis contre, Holynes, contemplacioun. God let hem neuer skaterid be, And saue þe kyng, &amp; kepe þe crowne. By-?onde þe see, and we had nou?t, But all oure enemys so ney?e vs were, Þou? all here gold were hider brou?t, I wolde set hit at lytel store. Oure enemys wolde coke þerfore Wiþ ordynaunce &amp; habergeoun; Wynne þat, and wel more— Oure landes, oure lyues, þe reme, þe crowne. ?if we among oure-self debate, Þan endeþ floure of chyualrie. Alle oþere londis þat doþ vs hate, Oure feblenes wole aspye. On euery syde þey wole in hye; Þe stalworþe cast þe feble adoun. ?if þey wiþ my?t haue maystrye, ffro þe ri?t heire wolde take þe crowne. ?if sercle, and floures, &amp; riche stones, Were eche a pece fro oþer flet; Were þe crowne broken ones, Hit were ful hard a?en to knet. Auyse ?ow er ?e suffre þat fit. Amende, ?e þat mende mown! ?e þat ben wysest, cast ?oure wyt! Stonde wiþ þe kyng to kepe þe crowne. To kepe þe crowne, god graunte ?ow grace, And let it neuere be to-broken; ffor word of wynd lityl trespase; Non harm nys don, þou? word be spoken. Let wysdom be vnloken, Apert &amp; preuyly to rowne. ffor non euyll, wille no man be wroken, But stonde wiþ ri?t, mayntene þe crowne. A man my?te be forborn ffer fro a kynges place; Wolde make a kyng to be forsworn To lette þe lawe it most not passe. And make hym wene þat he grace, And holy in condicioun, And mayntene hym in his trespace, While he pykeþ þe stones out of þe crowne. A kyngdom must be gouerned by ri?t, To chastyse false þat ar aspyed. ffalsed and trouþe to-gydre wole fi?t, Til oon þat oþer haþ distroyd. Til trouþe be fro treson tryed, Shal neuere be pes in regyon. In all kyngdomes þat man haþ gyed, To þe place of vertues, god geueþ þe crowne. Thou? falsed trouþe defame, veritas Trouþe secheþ non hernes to shewe his speche; Trouþe of his craft þenkeþ no shame; He is bold, alle folk his craft to teche; And euere by trouþe stondes wreche, ffor wreche is goddis champioun. Or wreche smyte, god be leche, And saue þe kyng, &amp; kepe þe crowne. Loke or þyng þat ?e begynne; Caste before how it wole ende, Gostly, bodyly, what mowe ?e wynne. Eche man destroy?e his best frend— So dede fflaundres. how dede it wende? Of noblay þey han lore þe sown; Pray we god his bowe of wraþþe vnbende, And saue þe kyng, &amp; kepe þe crowne. God ?eueþ his doom to alle kynges þat be; As a god, in erþe a kyng haþ my?t. Holy writ byd, blissed be he In alle tymes þat demeþ ry?t. Men do in derk, god seeþ in ly?t. Synne, morþere, derne tresoun, Not may be hyd fro goddis sy?t. To ry?twys Iuge, god ?eueþ þe crowne. That lord loueþ lityl hym-selue Þat ?eueþ his blisse for sorwe &amp; woo; ffor þe loue of ten or twelue, Make alle folk his foo, And lese þe loue of god also ffor fawte of perfeccyone. Þou? he had no vauntage but of þo, He my?te were a symple crowne. Eche a kyng haþ goddis power, Of lyf &amp; leme to saue &amp; spille. He muste make god his partener, And do not his owen wille. ffor god resceyueþ eche pore mannys bille, And of here playnt, god hereþ þe sowne. Sette ?oure assise in euene skille, Counseile þe kyng to kepe þe crowne. The fadir, þe wanton child wole kenne, Chastyse wiþ ?erde &amp; bete hit sore. So after, þe fadyr þe ?erde wole brenne, When child is wys &amp; takeþ to lore. We han ben goddis ?erde ?ore; Chastysed kyngdom, castell, &amp; towne. Twyggis of oure ?erde we haue forlore. God saue þe kyng, &amp; kepe þe crowne. Englische men dede maystry?es make; Þurgh all þe world, here word it sprong. Cristen &amp; heþen þey mad to quake, Tok &amp; slowen kynges strong. God let neuere werre be vs among, To lese þat blo of gret renowne; Ne neuere oure ri?t be turned to wrong. God saue þe kyng, &amp; kepe þe crowne. Among oure-self, ?if fi?t be raysed, Þan stroye we oure awen nest. Þat haþ victor, wole be euel payed; So many good men ben lest. ?it is beter bowe þan brest. Eche man is bounden to resoun. ?e þat ben wysest, take þe best. Conseile þe kyng, mayntene þe crowne. A comyns my?t sone be shent, Wiþ-outen kyng or gouernour; And a kyng wiþoute rent My?t li?tly trussen his tresour. ffor comons mayntene lordis honour, Holy chirche, and religyoun; ffor comouns is þe fayrest flour Þat euere god sette on erþely crown. Gode, lete þis kyngdom neuere be lorn Among oure-self in no distance! Oþer kyngdomes lau?he vs not to skorn, And sey, “for synne, god send vengeance.” God ?eue vs space of repentance, Good lyf, and deuocioun. And god, kepe in þy gouernance Oure comely kyng, and saue þe crowne. 15. THE FOLLIES OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY (1419) A remembraunce of LII folyes. Digby MS. 102 (Sum. Cat. No. 1703) Loke how fflaundres doþ fare wiþ his folyhede! Durste no man dygge after trouþe wiþ no manere toles. To wynne wrongly wele, wod þey gan wede, But werkis of wys men were cast vnder stoles. Glosers counseled lordis for to take mede, To maken hem riche, and here lordis pore foles. Whan þe souereyns were set here sogettis to drede, Þe glosers skulked away, for shame of here sooles. ffalsed shal neuere ben ateynt Til Iuge here eche mannys pleynt; Redresse, &amp; make an ende, Or ellys to mercy bende; Make hem kyssen &amp; be frende Þat were fon feynt. ffyfty folyes ben, &amp; two— Alle þo y wole mynne among. To triste in trete to his fo Þat haþ begyled hem ofte &amp; long; And hate hem þat telle hym so, And wilfully wolle suffre wrong. It is worthy he smerte &amp; be wo, Þat of his owen skyn wole kerue a thong. Þat chepen moche, &amp; not han to paye, And wiþ his lord to homly wole playe; Swere moche, &amp; not be trowed; Boste moche, &amp; not allowed; Threte alle men, &amp; neuere on-bowed: All are folyes, þat y say. He is a fool, þat werre wole wake, Þat may not maynten it wiþ mede, And so moche vndertake Þat wot wel he may not spede. And of his ney?ebour his enemy make ffor a straunge mannys dede; And he þat mesure wole forsake, And nedles put hym-self in drede. Of mannys deþ haue no rouþe, But hate hem þat tellen hym trouþe; Loue hym þat cherische hym in synne, And suche games begynne Where þat he wot he may not wynne, But besyen hym in slouþe. He is a fool, þat no good can, Ne non wole lere, but slow in dede. A gret fool, y holde þat man, Þat of his enemys haþ no drede. Þurgh suche foly, fflaundres be-gan; Of after perile þey tok non hede. Hit is worthy he ete bred of bran, Þat wiþ floure his foo wil fede. And truste al in gloser charmes, In hyndryng in worschip of armes, And lette lawe it mot not syt, And conscience away flyt, May brynge a lord, er þat he wyt, Emyddis grete harmes. fflaundres was þe richest land, and meriest to mynne; Now is it wrappid in wo, &amp; moche welþe raft. ffor defaute of Iustice, and syngulere to wynne, Þey were rebell, to ryse craft a?en craft. Here lord had part of þe foly þey were wounden ynne; ffor-thy he les his lordshipe, &amp; here fraunchise raft. Here enemys lawhen hem to skorne, &amp; seyn, “for synne, Of here banere of grace, god broken haþ þe shaft.” When prelat is forbode to preche, No trewe man trouþe dar teche; Encresyng of temperalte Suspende spiritualte. What land is gouerned in þat degre, May wayte after wreche. I holde hym a fool, pou? he be wys, Þat spekeþ among men of name Þat at his wysdom set no prys, But skorne hym &amp; don blame. And he þat telleþ where peryle lys, And gete no þonk but harm &amp; shame; And he þat pleyneþ, y holde hym nys, Þat get no mendys, but dowble grame. By þese poyntes fflaundres was lest; Now is it out of rule &amp; of rest. Drede is here chef gayte. So eche man on hem bayte, Þat ?et þey honge in awayte Of a newe conquest. He þat my?t thryue, and nel not thee, Ne his owen harmes knawe, Apert ne in preuytee, Serue god for loue ne awe, Ne gouerne wel his owen degre, Ne rule hymself in ry?twys lawe, Whan wyse men fro hym fle— Þen god his grace wole fro hem drawe. Þat moche wynneþ, and no-thyng wole haue, But ?eue it awey to nedeles þat craue, A?ens conscience despit Borwe moche, &amp; neuere quyt; When god for þat gylt smyt, What glosere can þat wounde saue? Þat freek may wel be holden a fool, Þat wayueþ wit &amp; worcheþ by wille, And skippe into sclaundre scol, And scorne hym þat telleþ hym skylle, And lyue in Lenton as in ?ool, His flesch in foly to fulfille. Þou? þe dotard deye in dool, Þe ry?twys nel not rewe his ylle.

Than spake a berne upon the bent, Of comforte that was not colde, and sayd, “we have brente northomberlond; We have all welth in holde. “now we have haryed all bamborowe schyre, all the welth in the worlde have wee.

Rome, MS. 1306 In Iuyll whan the sonne shone shene, Bowes burgoned, and leves grene Gan change thaire coloures; And fresshe floures that April made Began to feynt and fade, Of lovely swete odours; And faire floures grete and smale Gan to ripe and wax pale; Than cometh tyme of labours, To profit and worshippe wynne In armes, so þer be not ther-in Vntrouthe ne false colours. The Duc of Burgone, of grete pride, Made grete assemble in landes wide, In flandres and Braband, Of all the power and Chiualrie Of Burgone and of Pykardie, Of hanaude and holland. An Cml lti and moo, That were able to ride and goo, To bere spere and shelde, And made avaunt Calais to wynne; And alle shuld dye that were therin, Man, woman, and childe. The wolles and the merchandise, And other godes of grete emprise, Eche shulde haue a certeine; The walles thay wolde bete adovn, Tour, castell, and dongeon, And all shuld be made pleyne. And thus with rede baner displaied, With other in iij batelles araied, They come the tovn aboute; Stately tentes anon they pight, Large, longe, and of gret hight, It was a riall rowte. With gonnes grete and ordinance, That theyme myght helpe and avance; With many a proude pavis, Gailly paynted and stuffed wele; Ribawdes armed with Iren and stele, Was neuer better devyse. So many ml cokkes to crow anyght, And also cressettes that brenned light, Grete wonder to here and see. How sone thay made her loggyng, Defense of erthe in dykyng, Redier myght noon bee. The Erle of Morteyne made a dyner, And said, “fellowes, be of gode chere! And nothing haue we doute. I trust to god to see that day, That for al thaire proude aray fful low that thay shul lowte.” The lietanant, ser Iohn Radclyf, That loued worshipp and dred repref, Kept full gode gouernance; So did the Baron of Dudley, In the Castell, the sothe to sey, Made full gode ordenance. The lord Cameux at Boleyn yate, The Bulwerk he did vndertake; At no tyme wolde he faille, Neither late ne erly, Yif any wight were so hardy At oones forto assaille. At the mylkyate, ser william of Asshton, And ser geffray warberton, With many an hardy man, The Trumpettes lowd did they blow, ffor the Duc sholde wel know The wacch whan it began. The porters kept full manly The yates open continuelly, To wake were they not yrke; Þe trew soudeours, bothe day and nyght, Lay on the walle in armes bright— It was thaire hous and kirk. The maire and burgeis were full bovn fforto defende thaire possession, It longed to hem of right; The worthy merchantes were redy, At al tyme and euery skry, It was a ful gode sight. And so did the gode comon, That had stuffed wel the tovn With godes and vitaille, In tovn and felde to ride and goo, And alle other werkes to doo In al that myght availle. The women, bothe yonge and olde, With stones stuffed euery scaffolde— They spared no swete ne swynk; With boilled caudrons, grete and smale, Yif thay wolde haue sawted the wall, Al hote to gif hem drynke. The first day the ennemys proude Began to skirmyssh with shoutes lowde, But countred they were anon. Gonners began to shew thaire art; Into the tovn in many a part Shot many a full grete ston. Thanked be god, and marie mylde, They hurt neither man, woman, ne childe; Houses, thogh, they did harme. “Seynt Barbara!” than was the crie, Whan stones in the tovn did flye, They cowde noon other charme. And for the duc logged hym no nere, At the southwest corner, Of gonnes he had a songe; That anoon he left his place, And to the est ende he made a chace, Hym thoght he bode to longe. There myght men see Archers gode Cast away bothe gowne and hode, The better forto shote; The frenshe and flemmyssh were full fayn To thaire tentes retourne ageyn, Þey saw noon other bote. And euer among an Irissh man On his hoby that swiftly ran; It was a sportfull sight How his dartes he did shake; And whan hym lust to leve or take, They had full grete dispite. Also an hounde that hight goby, That longed to the waterbailly, fful swiftly wolde he renne. At euery skirmyssh to trauaille, Man and horse he wolde assaille, fful wel he cowde hem kenne. And so befell, and on a thursday, The Erle of Morteigne made afray At Saint Peters on the playn; He drove hem to her tentes nere, And toke many a prisoner, And many of hem were slayn. And after, they come with grete Navy, With bulged shippes ful craftily, The hauen forto haue shent, At friday nyght; but on the morow, Than began the dukes sorow, His shippes whan he saw brent. And soon after, within a while, Drawen dovn was his bastyle, With many an hardy man; His men of armes were leide to grovnde; And som ascaped with dethes wounde; But there were fewe taan. The next nyght, or it was day, Erly the duc fled away; With hym, they of Gaunt; And after, Bruges and Ipre bothe, To folow hym were they not lothe. Thus kept thay thaire avaunt. ffor thay had verray knowyng Of the duc of Gloucester commyng Calais to rescowe; And because they bode not there, In flandres he sought hem fer and nere, That thay may euer rewe. O oonly god, in whom is all, Save Calais the tovn riall, That euer it mot wel cheve Vnto the crovn of England, As longe as the world shal stonde, That noon enemys it greve! Amen. Explicit. 29. MOCKERY OF THE FLEMINGS (1436) Lambeth Palace MS. 6 And on this wise, Phelip, duk of Burgoyn, &amp; the fflemynges, departid from Caleis, and þe pycardes from þe Castel of Guysnes with gret shame &amp; gret diswurship &amp; with gret losse. Wherfore amonges Englisshmen were made many rymes of þe fflemmynges, among the which one is here sette for a remembraunce, that saith on this wise: When ye fflemmyng wer fressh florisshid in your flouris And had weth at your will, ye wolde be conquerouris Of Caleis, þat litill toun, as it come in youre mynde. But ye to conquere Caleis it comeþ you not of kynde. Remembres on þat wurship ye wann the first day, When the erle of Mortein come passing with his pray Before youre toun of Grauenyng, wher ye as men bold Com rennyng on hym fersli as lyons of Cotteswold, With habirgeons, &amp; hounsculles, &amp; rusti kettill-hattes, With long pykes—goden daghes for to stikke the rattes, With messis, &amp; meskins, &amp; eke with side Iakes Doun vnto mydde þe leg of kanuas, lyke to sakes, Stoppid al with hempen tawe, and þat in straunge wise, Stiched like a matrace al of þe newe gyse. Ye laid vpon þ'englisshmen so myghtily with your handes, Til of you iij hundrid lay strechid on the sandes. Ye fled þen in-to Grauenyng and wold no lenger bide, And gaue þe erle leue to passe ouer that same tyde In saafte with his prisoners, &amp; lost neuer a man. This was þe first wurship of Caleys that ye wan. Remembres how ye laide seege with gret pryde &amp; bost To Caleis, þat littil toun. the noumbre of your host Was a hundrid thousand &amp; fifty, to reken by þe pollis, As it was þat same tyme founden by youre rollis. And yette for al youre gret host, erly nothir late, Caleis was so ferd of you þey shitte neuer a gate. Remembres how ye drowned att full see for þe nones With shippes Caleis hauen massoned with stones, And how that þe calisers hem brake the next day, When it was lawe watir, and bare hem clene away— Euery stikke &amp; stone, &amp; lafte not ther one log. Remembres eke on Goby, the watir-bailliffes dog, How he scarmysshed with you twyes vpon the day, And among you on þe sandes made many a fray. Remembres ye of Brugges, how ye first wan youre shon, How ye com forth to scarmyssh vpon an aftirnon With pauyses &amp; crossebowes on saynt Petirs playn; And how sone the Calisers made you to turn agayn, And ouerthrew you sodeynly, or euer that ye wist, And brought you in-to Caleis tyed fastly by the fist. Remembres ye of Gaunt eke, for al youre pride &amp; bost, Wonnen was youre bulwerk beside youre gret host, And slayn all that was therin; &amp; ye that same night ffled ouer Grauenyng watir, but go þat go myght; And youre lord with you, for dreed and for fere Of the duyk of Gloucester—&amp; yette was he not þer! Wel was hym might go before with pison &amp; with paunce, And laft behind you for hast al your ordynaunce. Remembres ye picardes, at seege eke as ye lay, Of Guysnes that strong Castel how ye fled away, ffor ryngyng of the larum bell shamfulli in a morowe; As ferd as þe fflemmynges, with hertes full of sorowe, Ye lost there your ordynaunce of gunnes that was cheff; To you &amp; to al pycardis, shame and gret repreff! Remembres now ye fflemmynges, vpon youre own shame, When ye laide seege to Caleis ye wer right full to blame, ffor more of reputacioun ben englisshmen þen ye, And comen of more gentill blode of olde antiquite; ffor flemmynges com of flemmed men, ye shal wel vndirstand, ffor fflemed men &amp; banshid men enhabit first youre land. Thus proue I þat fflemmynges is but a flemed man, And fflaunders of flemmynges the name first began; And þerfore ye fflemmynges, þat fflemmynges ben named, To compare with englisshmen ye aught to be ashamed. Ye be nothing elles worth but gret wordes to camp, Sette ye stille &amp; bith in pees, God gyue you quadenramp! Such &amp; many oþir rimes were made amonges englisshmen, aftir the fflemmynges were thus shamfully fled frome Caleis, &amp; þe picardis from Guisnes fledd &amp; gon þeire way, for drede &amp; fere of þe comyng of the duyk of Gloucestre, which by þat tyme was redy at london with his power &amp; armee to com to þe rescows of Caleis, &amp; to shippe at Sandwich, wher as lay redy in þe hauen iijc sailes to abyde his comyng. 30. SCORN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY (1436) A songe made of the Duc of Bourgone. English Coll. Rome MS. 1306 O thou Phelippe, fonder of new falshede, Distourber of pees, Capiteine of cowardise, Sower of discorde, Repref of al knyghthode, Whiche of al burgoigne (that is so grete of pryse) Thou clepist thiself duc—whan wiltow rise, And in pleyn felde doo mustre with thy launce? Se how all knyghthode thy werre dothe despise, Wite thyn ovne falsnes al thy myschance! Remembre the, Phelippe, and haue in mynde How king henre the vte, of veray gentilnesse, Withoute thy desert he was to the kynde, And alway thy socour whan thou were in distresse, Defendyng thy personne from al wilfulnesse Of alle thy mortall enemys, of England and fraunce, Wherfore thou shewedist grete vnkyndenesse, The which þou may wite alle thi myschance. Remembre the, Phelippe, at thy begynnyng Whan that thy fader thurgh conspired treson, By assent of Charles that calleth hymself kyng Of the reame of france, withoute grovnde of reson, Was at Motreux broght to his confusion. To king henry there thou did thy ligeance; Of lyf and land he was thy proteccion, Wherfore thyn ovne falsnesse causeth thy myschance. Remembre the, Phelippe, what tyme and how To kyng henry the fyft by thyn ovne assent, Withoute his desire, thou madest a solempne vow, Vsyng goddes body the holy sacrement, To become trew ligeman with gode entent To hym and to his heires without variance. Thou art false to god, by thyn owne assent, Whiche thou may wite al thy mischance. Remembre the, Phelipp, that the yonge king Henre the sixt was crowned at Paryse, Iohn duc of Bedford thyn absence excusyng, By souffisant warant made by thy devise; He did thyn omage as to the floure-de-lice, Next by condescent and true inheritance. This matere the lust not to aduertise; Wite thyn owne falsnesse al thy myschance. Remembre the, Phelippe, how peple of England, Haue been to the euer gentil and trew, ffor whan thou were beseged with many a thousand Of Armynakes, thay did the rescewe! Perfourmyng thy desire bothe olde and new, Euer redy thyn honeur to mayntene and avance. Thou moste vnkynde prince that euer man knew, Thyn ovne falsnesse causeth thy myschance! Phelippe, thy falsnes was shewed openly In that thy lige lord thou woldest neuer see, While he was in france continually A yere and an half to know his contree, And as a rightwys kyng there crovned to bee. Thou absent thiself with feyned contenance, Imagenyng alway cruell sotilte, The whiche thou may wite all thy myschance. Phelippe, at Aras, thy falshed to encrece, Bothe of thyn avow and othes with all, Before th'embassatours of trete of pees Thou shewedest thyself assoilled by a cardinal, The which was withoute power papall. þou did provow charles, rightwis king of france, fforsaking thy ligelord and frend moste special; Now wite thyn owne falsnesse al thy myschance. Phelippe, beholde the flemmynges beside grauelyng How thay encountred Morteigne as he was homward; He slow of hem hundredes, hymself defendyng; Beholde eke and see before the tovn of Arde How cameux distrussed grete power of Picarde; Wite thin owne falsnes and grete maintenance; Thay turned her backes as thay were coward; Thy falsnes is begynnyng of al thy myschance. Phelippe, thurgh thy falshede and gyle, Bothe Parys, Pountois, and Boys vincent Were vnwerly wonne by the lord lyle; And eke the Castel of Oye whan thou haddest brent, The peple thou henge by cruel Iugement; Thus thou began werre with treson and vengeance: Wherfore by right dome of god omnipotent, Thy treson shal ende with sorow and myschance. Phelippe, thy princehode was vtterly repreved Whan thou tofore Calais thy tentes had pight, And for feer of shotte thou bacward remeued; A gretter shame at sege gat hym neuer knyght, fforto see thy bastyle be stroied by goddes myght— It was thy grete trust and chief ordenance. Thy peple therin were slayn dovn right, Wite thyn owne falsnes al thy myschance. Phelippe, thurgh thy prudence and reule politik, To let Calais of rescow and vitaille, þou didest abolge shippes with walles of bryke; But whan thou knew thy purpos myght not availle, And duc humfray at Sandwich redy to saille To rescow Calais and doo his ligeance, Thou flygh away for drede of bataille: Neuer prince brak sege with gretter myschance. Beholde duc humfray with knyghtly desire To meve thy courage the felde forto take; He soght the in flandres with swerd and with fyre, Nyne daies brennyng, no pees did he make. Where art thou, Phelippe, whan wiltow þy swerd shake? Where is thy strong power and grete alliance? Thy land is distroied, and thou dar not awake. Thus endith thy purpos with sorow and myschance. Conteyne thiself, Phelipp, rightwisly shamed, Vnderstonde thiself nothing availlable; See thurgh cowardise thy knyghthod defamed, To werre ayenst god, thenk thou art not able— fforsake thy frowardnes and become stable, Be trew of promesse and sadde of gouernance, Obey thy ligelord, and be not variable Lest thou be destroied and ende with myschance.

Þai beo so sliper at assai, So leof to han, and loþ to lete, And so fikel in heore fai, Þat selden I-sei?e is sone for?ete. I sei hit not wiþouten a cause, And þerfore takes riht good hede, ffor ?if ?e construwe wel þis clause I puit ?ou holly out of drede, Þat for puire schame ?or hertes wol blede, And ?e þis matere wysli trete: He þat was vr moste spede Is selden I-seye and sone for?ete. Sum tyme an Englisch schip we had, Nobel hit was, and heih of tour; Þorw al Cristendam hit was drad; And stif wolde stande in vch a stour, And best dorst byde a scharp schour And oþer stormes, smale and grete; Now is þat schip, þat bar þe flour, Selden se?e and sone for?ete. Into þat schip þer longed a rooþur, Þat steered þe schip &amp; gouerned hit; In al þis world nis such anoþur, As me þinkeþ in my wit. Whyl schip and roþur togeder was knit, Þei dredde nouþer tempest, druy?e, nor wete; Nou be þei boþe In synder flit— Þat selden sey?e is sone for?ete. Scharpe wawes þat schip has sayled, And sayed alle sees at auentur; ffor wynt ne wederes neuer hit fayled, Whil þe roþur mihte enduir. Þou? þe see were rouh, or elles dimuir, Gode hauenes þat schip wolde gete; Nou is þat schip, I am wel suir, Selde I-seye and sone for?ete. Þis goode schip I may remene To þe chiualrye of þis londe; Sum tyme þei counted nou?t a bene Beo al ffraunce, Ich vnderstonde.

Þat schip hadde a ful siker mast, And a sayl strong and large, Þat made þe gode schip neuer agast To vndertake a þing of charge. And to þat schip þer longed a barge, Of al ffraunce ?af nou?t a clete. To vs hit was a siker targe, And now riht clene hit is for?ete. Þe roþur was nouþer ok ne elm; Hit was Edward þe þridde, þe noble kniht; Þe prince his sone bar vp his helm, Þat neuer scoumfited was in fiht.

Þe swifte barge was Duk Henri, Þat noble kniht, &amp; wel assayed; And in is leggaunce worþili He abod mony a bitter brayd. ?if þat his enemys ou?t outrayed, To chastis hem wolde he not lete.

THE DEATH OF EDWARD IV (1483) Kyng Edward the iiijth. Rylands Lib. Manchester, Eng. MS. 113 Wher is this Prynce that conquered his right Within Ingland, master of all his ffoon; And after ffraunce, be very force &amp; myght, Without stroke, and afterward cam hoom; Made Scotlond to yelde, and Berwyk wan he from; Rydyng a hontyng, hym-silff to sporte &amp; playe? All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to praye. This most dred prince that was vnder the son, Through all this wordle renewed was his name; The dowthiest, the worthiest, withouten comparison, Ther was noon suche, but ye reken the same, Compassed the wordle, so spronge his name; And as in batell, the ffresshest I shall say. All men of England ar bounde for hym to pray. Wher is he nowe, that man of noble men, That in his howsold kepte the ryall rowte? Ther is no place in all the wordle, I ken, but of the substaunce he hath chosen owte. Hit was a wordle to se hym ride aboute Through-out his land, and that was day be day. All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. O noble Edward, wher art thowe be-come, Which full worthy I haue seen goyng in estate? Edward the iiijth I mene, with the sonne, The rose, the sonne-beme, which was full fortunate. Noon erthly prince durst make with hym debate. Art thowe agoo, and was here yestirday? All men of Englond ar bound for the to pray. The well of knyghthode, withouten any pere, Of all erthely prynces thowe were the lode-sterre! Be-holde &amp; rede, herkyn well and hyre! In gestis, in romansis, in Cronicles nygh &amp; ferre, Well knowen it is, þer can no man it deferre, Perelees he was, and was here yestirday. All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. ffy on this wordle! What may we wrecches say, Thate nowe haue lost the lanterne &amp; the light? Oure kyng oure lorde—alas, and wele-a-wey! In euery felde full redy for oure right; It was no nede to pray hym for to fight; Redy he was, that was here yestirday. All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. Me thynkith euer this kyng sholde not be gon. I see his lordis, I see his knyghtis all; I see his plasis made of lyme and ston; I see his seruauntes sittyng in the hall, And walkyng among them his marchall. What sholde I say? he was here yestirday! All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. I am be-giled, for he is past and goon. I mette his men wepyng in clothis blake— Not oon nor tweyn, god wote, many oon, Which daily waylith &amp; sorowith for his sake. Hit to endite, hit makith my herte quake, When I remembre he was here yestirday. All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. Nowe pray we to god, that all this wordle hath wrought, Among his aungelis this prince may haue a place; And for his passion that vs so dere hath brought, That of his paynys he may haue his grace. Nowe, gracious lord, remembre well this case! As wofull synners, we call to the, and say, That we of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. Ye wofull men that shall this writyng rede, Remembre well here is no dwellyng place. Se howe this prince is from vs goon, and dede, And we shall aftir hym sue the trace. Ther is no choise, ther is noon other grace; This knowe ye well—he was here yestirday. All men of Englond ar bounde for hym to pray. Explicit. POLITICAL PROPHECIES 43. GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH'S PROPHECY MS. Rawlinson K.42 (Sum. Cat.

All to destroye somme schall entende; And that theyre conceyte be nott soo Off þat may sewe a dredfull ende, That woolle be cause of mykell woo. What tyme Normandye schall be lorne, With ryght grete grame and dyshonoure, Þat helde of Englonde longe beforne, hym schall be rewe hit with grete doloure. Hym schall wante of hys astate, To hys garlonde a precyovse floure, Whiche oure fore faders wy?tlye gate— Cyte, Castell, Towne and towre.

THE COCK IN THE NORTH Cotton Rolls ii.23 When the cocke in the Northe hath bilde his nest, And buskith his briddis and becenys hem to fle, Þen shall fortune his frend the yatis vp cast, And right shall haue his fre entree; Thene shall the mone rise in the northewest, In a clowde of blake as þe bill of a crowe. Then shall þe lion louse the boldest and þe best, Þat in brytayne was born syne arthers day. And a dredefull dragon shall drawe hym from his denne To helpe the lion with all his myght. A bull and a bastard with speris to spen, Shall a-bide with the bore to reken the right. A libard shall be gendred of a natiffe kynd, With þe sterre of bedlem shall ryse in the southe; The molle and the mermayden mevith in mynd— Criste that is oure creature hath cursid hem by mouthe! The Egill and the antelope shall boldly abide, A bridellid hors, and a bere with brondis so bright. At sondyford, for-sothe, on the southe syde, A prowde prince in a prese lordly shall he light, With bolde baronis, bernis in bassenettis, þat busshement shal mete, That shall the prophecy preve that Thomas of tellis; ffor þer shall mony a comely knyght be cast vnderfete, That shall make maydens to wepe that in bowre dwellis. Þen shall þe day of desteny dryve to þe nyght; And a maiden and wife in mornyng be brought. Þer shall mete in morowe by þe mone-light; Betwene seton and þe se a sorow shall be wroght. The lion shall lache an hurt, and not perisshed be; But he shall broyde to þe best þat hym þe woo wroght. And a man ascend on tho sterre shall fold for þat fre, Þe prowdest on þat prese with hale hath hytte bought. The fox and the filmard and a honde shall a-take, And to the lion be ladde lowe to a-bide. Bothe þe pikard and þe pye shall suffre þe same, And alle þe ffryndes of the fox shall fall for here pride. Than shall troy vntrew tremble þat dayes, ffor drede of a dede man when þey here hym speke. The townis and þe Commons of kent shall cast vp þe kayes, Þe busshement of bryk-hull þer-with shall breke. When wormys and wedis are wasted and a-wey went, And ilke a segge in seson kyndly set and song, And all right hath his rewle and falsenes is blent, All grace and goodenes shall growe vs among. The sonne and the mone shall shyne full bright, That mony a day full derk hath ben, And kepe þer cowrses by dayes and by nyght With myrthes mo than ony man can mene. Þe lion and þe lionasse shall regne in pese. This bridlyngton, bede, bokis, and Banaster tellis, Thomas, and merlyon, the same with-outen lese, They recorden and other that with prophecy mellis. Then shall saxons chese theym a lord, Þat shall rewle hem rightfully and bryng hem vndere. A dede man shall make by-twene hem a-corde, And this a ferly and a grete wondere. He that is ded and buryed in sight, Shall ryse agayn, and lyve in lond, In confortyng of a yong knyght That ffortune hath chosen to be here housbond. The whele shall turne to hym full ryght, Þat ffortune hath chosen to be here fere. In surrey shall be shewid a wonderfull sight, In the Cite of Babilon to bryng hem on bere: xv dayes Iorney from Ierusalem The holy crosse shall be; Þe same bore shall wynne þe beme, At sondyford that degre. ffor ffortune hath graunted hym the victorye, ffro the first tyme he armys bere; ffor ony treson or trechery, Desteny shall hym not dere, Till kynd of oxe to hym drawe, ffor euery man is wormys fee; But he shall ende in goddes lawe, And in Iosephath beryed he shall be. 45.

Harley MS. 367 To London once my stepps I bent, where trouth in no wyse should be faynt, To westmynster-ward I forthwith went, to a man of law to make complaynt. I sayd, “for marys love, that holy saynt, Pyty the poore that wold proceede.” but, for lack of mony, I cold not spede. And as I thrust the prese amonge, by froward chavnce my hood was gone, yet for all that I stayd not longe, tyll at the kynges bench I was come. before the Iudge I kneled anon, and prayd hym for gods sake to take heede. but, for lack of mony, I myght not speede. Beneth them sat clarkes a gret Rout, which fast dyd wryte by one assent; There stoode vp one and cryed about, “Rychard, Robert, and Iohn of Kent!” I wyst not well what this man ment, he cryed so thycke there in dede. but he that lackt mony myght not spede. Unto the common place I yode thoo, where sat one with a sylken hoode; I dyd hym reverence for I ought to do so, &amp; told my case as well as I coolde, how my goodes were defravded me by falshood. I gat not a mvm of his mouth for my meed! and, for lack of mony, I myght not spede. Vnto the Rolls I gat me from thence, before the Clarkes of the Chavncerye, where many I found earnyng of pence, but none at all once regarded mee. I gave them my playnt vppon my knee, they lyked it well, when they had it reade; but, lackyng mony, I could not be sped. In westmynster hall I fovnd out one, which went in a long gown of Raye; I crowched and kneled before hym anon, for maryes love, of help I hym praye. “I wot not what thou meanest,” gan he say; to get me thence he dyd me bede, for lack of mony I cold not speede. with-in this hall, nether rych nor yett poor wold do for me ought, Although I shold dye. which seing, I gat me out of the doore, where flemynges began on me for to cry: “master, what will you copen or by? fyne felt hattes, or spectacles to reede? lay down your sylver, and here you may speede.” then to westmynster gate I presently went, when the sonn was at hyghe pryme, Cookes to me they tooke good entent, and profered me bread with ale and wyne, rybbs of befe, both fat and ful fyne. a fayre cloth they gan for to sprede, but, wantyng mony, I myght not speede. Then vnto London I dyd me hye, of all the land it beareth the pryse: “hot pescodes,” one began to crye; “strabery rype,” and “cherryes in the ryse!” one bad me come nere and by some spyce; peper and safforne they gan me bede. but, for lack of mony, I myght not spede. then to the Chepe I gan me drawne, where mutch people I saw for to stand; one ofred me velvet, sylke, and lawne; an-other he taketh me by the hande, “here is Parys thred, the fynest in the land.” I never was used to such thynges in dede, and, wantyng mony, I myght not spede. then went I forth by London stone, throughout all Canwyke streete; drapers mutch cloth me offred anone; then comes me one, cryed, “hot shepes feete.” one Cryde, “makerell”; “Ryshes grene,” an-other gan greete. on bad me by a hood to cover my head; but, for want of mony, I myght not be sped. Then I hyed me Into Estchepe. one cryes, “rybbs of befe, &amp; many a pye!” Pewter pottes they clattered on a heape; there was harpe, pype, and mynstrelsye. “yea, by cock!” “nay, by cock!” some began crye; Some songe of “Ienken and Iulyan” for there mede. but, for lack of mony, I myght not spede. Then Into Cornhyll anon I yode, where was mvtch stolen gere amonge; I saw where honge myne owne hoode, that I had lost amonge the thronge. to by my own hood I thought it wronge— I knew it well as I dyd my crede; but, for lack of mony, I could not spede. The Taverner tooke mee by the sleve, “Sir,” sayth he, “wyll you our wyne assay?” I answerd, “that can not mutch me greve; a peny can do no more then it may.” I drank a pynt, &amp; for it dyd paye; yet sore a-hungerd from thence I yede, and, wantyng mony, I cold not spede. Then hyed I me to Belyngsgate, and one cryed, “hoo! go we hence!” I prayd a barge-man, for gods sake, that he wold spare me my expence. “thou scapst not here,” quod he, “under ij pence; I lyst not yet bestow my Almes-dede.” thus, lacking mony, I could not speede. Then I convayed me Into Kent, ffor of the law wold I meddle no more, because no man to me tooke entent, I dyght me to do as I dyd before. now Iesus that in Bethlem was bore, Save london, and send trew lawyers there mede! for who-so wantes mony, with them shall not spede.

THE TWELVE ABUSES St. John's Coll. Cambridge MS. 37 Munus fit iudex, fraus est mercator in urbe; Non est lex dominus, nec timor est pueris. Ingenium dolus est, amor omnis ceca voluptas, Ludus rusticitas, et gula festa dies. Senex ridetur, sapiens mendosus habetur, Dives laudatur, pauper vbique iacet. Prudentes ceci, cognati degeneres sunt; Mortuus inmemor est, nullus amicus erit. ?eft is Domesman, &amp; gyle is chapman; Lordys ben owtyn lawe, &amp; chylderen ben withowtyn awe; Wyth is trechery, &amp; loue is lecherye; &amp; pley turnyt to vylanye, &amp; holyday to glotonye. Eld man in scornyng, wyse man in lesyng, Ryche man in levyng, &amp; pore man in losyng; Sly men ben blynd, &amp; kenred is onkynd; Þe ded is owtyn of mynd, for he may fynd noo frond. Virtus cessat. Ecclesia calcatur. Clerus errat. Demon regnat. Simonia dominatur.

In ladyis chaumberys comit he not, Þer dar trewþe settyn non fot; Þow he wolde he may not comyn among þe heye mene. With men of lawe he ha?t non spas— Þey louyn trewþe in non plas; me þinkit þey han a rewly grace, þat trewþe is put at swych degre. In holy cherche he may not sytte, fro man to man þey xuln hym flytte; It rewit me sore, in myn wytte; Of trewþe I haue gret pete. Relygius þat xulde be good, If trewþe cum þer I holde hym wood!

Now wel, now wo, now frend, now foo; Now lef, now þef, now in, now out; Now cum, now go, now to, now fro— A lord, how gos þis word a-bowte!

If yt be as I wene, thyng þat semyth grene, ys ofte fadyd of hew. Wyll ys tak for reson; Trew loue ys full geson; No man sett be shame. Trost ys full of treson; Eche man oderys cheson, No man hym-seylfe wyll blame. Thys warlde ys varyabyll, No-thyng þer-in ys stable, A-say now, ho-so wyll. Syn yt is so mutable, how shuld men be stable? yt may not be thorow skyll! Whane brome wyll appolles bere, &amp; humlok hony in feere, þan sek rest in lond. With men is no pees; Ne rest in hart is, no lese, With few be see &amp; sond. Sythyn þer is no rest, I hold it for þe best, god to be owre frend. he þat ys owre lord, delyuer vs ou?t with hys word, &amp; gravnt vs a good ende! 62. NOW IS ENGLAND PERISHED Cambridge Univ. MS.

Many fals slawnders of riches, And yet pouerte apperith neuerthelesse; Many beades &amp; fewe prayers, Many dettours &amp; fewe good payers. Small festyng &amp; lytyll penaunce, Thus all is turned in-to myschaunce, Extorcion, &amp; moch Symony, fals couetyse with periurye; With lechery &amp; aduowetrye, ffayned frenship &amp; ypocrisye; Also gyle on euery syde, With murdre &amp; much pride; Great envy &amp; wilfulnes, With-out mercy or rightwysnes; The cause is for lak of light, That shuld be in the church of right. 63. THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN Bodl. MS. Eng. poet. b.4 Religious pepille leuyn in holynesse, Seruiabli with-owte transmutacion. Enuy exilid is fro gentylnesse; And for ypocrosye ys set deuocion. In lawe trouthe hathe his dominacion; All dowblenesse venquesschid bi right at þe desire; Stablenesse foundon, and spesialli in a-tire. Amongge the comyns pride is now exilid; Louers vsyn no fayned countenaunce; In knyghthod largesse nwli ys reuyuyd. Ho can in court fynd eny variaunce? Prestus in litille han there suffisaunce; Conschiaunce with Marchaundice is cheffe lord &amp; syre; And stablenesse foundun, and spesialli in a-tire. Humblesse the name of rigour hath ow?t rased, Which grauen was in femynyte. Frenchip and Kynred to-gederis ben enbrasid; Bovnte his sugenaunsse hathe bewte; Fals Raungor ys fled; and benygnyte Of envi hath quenchid þe sotell fire; And stablenesse Foundon, &amp; spesialli in a-tire.

DEFEND US FROM ALL LOLLARDRY Cotton MS. Vespasian B.xvi Lo, he þat can be cristes clerc, And knowe þe knottes of his crede, Now may se a wonder werke, Of harde happes to take goud heede. The dome of dethe is heuy drede For hym þat wol not mercy crie; Þan is my rede, for mucke ne mede, Þat no man melle of lollardrye. I sey for meself, yut wist I neuer but now late what hit shuld be, and, by my trouth, I haue wel leuer no more kyn þan my a, b, c. To lolle so hie in suyche degre, hit is no perfit profecie, Sauf seker sample to þe &amp; me to be war of lollardie. The game is no?t to lolle so hie þer fete failen fondement; and yut is a moch folie for fals beleue to ben brent. þer þe bibell is al myswent, To iangle of Iob or Ieremye, þat construen hit after her entent for lewde lust of lollardie. Hit is vnkyndly for a kni?t, Þat shuld a kynges castel kepe, To bable þe bibel day &amp; ni?t In restyng tyme when he shuld slepe; &amp; carefoly awey to crepe, for alle þe chief of chiualrie. Wel aught hym to waile &amp; wepe, Þat suyche lust haþ in lollardie. An old castel, &amp; not repaired, With wast walles &amp; wowes wide, Þe wages ben ful yuel wared With suich a capitayn to abide; Þat rereth riot for to ride Agayns þe kynge &amp; his clergie, With priue peyne &amp; pore pride; Þer is a poynt of lollardie. for many a man withyn a while shal aby his gult ful sore; So fele gostes to begile hym aught to rue euermore. For his sorowe shal he neuer restore Þat he venemed with enuye; But ban þe burthe þat he was of bore, Or euer had lust in lollardie. Euery shepe þat shuld be fed in felde, &amp; kepte fro wolfes in her folde, Hem nedeth neþer spere ne shulde, Ne in no castel to be withholde. for þer þe pasture is ful colde, in somer seson when hit is drie; &amp; namly when þe soyle is solde, for lewde lust of lollardie. An old castel draw al don, hit is ful hard to rere hit newe, With suyche a congregacion þat cast hem to be vntrewe. When beggers mow neþer bake ne brewe, ne haue wherwith to borrow ne bie, Þan mot riot robbe or reve, Vnder þe colour of lollardie. That castel is not for a kynge þer þe walles ben ouerthrowe; &amp; yut wel wors abidynge whan þe captayn away is flowe, And forsake spere &amp; bowe, to crepe fro kni?thode into clergie. Þer is a bitter blast yblowe, to be bawde of lollardie. I trowe þer be no kni?t alyue Þat wold haue don so open a shame, for þat crafte to studi or striue, hit is no gentel mannes game; but if hym lust to haue a name of pelour vnder ipocrasie, &amp; þat wer a foule defame to haue suyche lose of lollardie. And, parde, lolle þei neuer so longe, yut wol lawe make hem lowte; God wol not suffre hem be so stronge to bryng her purpos so abowte, with saun? faile &amp; saun? doute, to rere riot and robberie; By reson þei shul not long route, while þe taile is docked of lollardie. Of þe hede hit is las charge, when grace wol not be his gide, Ne suffre hym for to lepe at large, but heuely his hede to hide. Where shuld he oþer route or ride agayns þe chief of chiualrie, Not hardi in no place to abide, for alle þe sekte of lollardie. A! god, what vnkyndly gost shuld greue þat god grucched nou?t! Thes lollardes þat lothen ymages most with mannes handes made &amp; wrou?t, &amp; pilgrimages to be sou?t; þei seien hit is but mawmentrie.

Ho wor ful lewde þat wolde byleue in figure mad of stok or ston, Yut fourme shuld we none repreue, neþer of marie ne of Ion, Petre, Poule, ne oþer none canonised by clergie; Þan þe seyntes euerychon be litel holde to lollardie. And namly Iames among hem alle for he twyes had turnement, Moch mischaunse mot him befalle þat last beheded hym in kent; &amp; alle þat were of þat assent. to crist of heuen I clepe &amp; crie, Send hem þe same Iugement, &amp; alle þe sekte of lollardie. For þat vengans agayns kynde was a poynt of cowardyse; &amp; namly suych on to bete or bynde þat mi?t not stand, set, ne rise. What dome wold ye hym deuyse by lawe of armes or gentrie, But serue hym in þe same wise, &amp; alle þe sekte of lollardie. When falsnes faileþ frele folie, pride wol preseyn sone amonge; Þan willerdome with old enuy can none oþer way but wronge. For synne &amp; shame with sorowe strong, So ouerset with avutrie, Þat fals beleue is fayn to fonge þe lewde lust of lollardie; and vnder colour of suiche lollynge, To shape sodeyn surreccion Agaynst oure liege lord kynge, with fals ymaginacion. &amp; for þat corsed conclusion, by dome of kni?thode &amp; clergie, Now turneth to confusion þe sory sekte of lollardie. For holy writ berith witnes, He þat fals is to his kyng, Þat shamful deth &amp; hard distres shal be his dome at his endynge. Þan double deth for suyche lollynge is heuy, when we shul hennes hye. Now, lord, þat madest of nou?t all thinge, defende vs all fro lollardie. CRITICS OF THE FRIARS 65. THE ORDERS OF CAIN (1382) Cotton MS.

Meteles so megre are þai made, &amp; penaunce so puttes ham doun, Þat ichone is an hors-lade when he shal trusse of toun. Allas, þat euer it shuld be so, Suche clerkes as þai about shuld go, Fro toun to toun by two &amp; two, to seke þair sustynaunce! By god þat al þis world wan, He þat þat ordre first bygan, Me thynk certes it was a man of simple ordynaunce. For þai haue noght to lyue by, þai wandren here &amp; þere, And dele with dyuers marcerye, right as þai pedlers were. Þai dele with purses, pynnes, &amp; knyues, With gyrdles, gloues for wenches &amp; wyues— Bot euer bacward þe husband thryues þer þai are haunted till. For when þe gode man is fro hame, And þe frere comes to oure dame, He spares nauþer for synne ne shame þat he ne dos his will. If þai no helpe of houswyues had, whan husbandes are not Inne, Þe freres welfare were ful bad, for þai shuld brewe ful þynne.

Þer is no pedler þat pak can bere Þat half so dere can sell his gere þen a frer can do. For if he gife a wyfe a knyfe þat cost bot penys two, Worþe ten knyues, so mot I thryfe, he wyl haue er he go. Ich man þat here shal lede his life, Þat has a faire doghter or a wyfe, Be war þat no frer ham shryfe, nauther loude ne still. Þof women seme of hert ful stable, With faire byhest and with fable Þat can make þair hertes chaungeable, and þair likynges fulfill. Be war ay with þe lymitour, &amp; with his felawe baþe; &amp; þai make maystries in þi bour, It shal turne þe to scaþe. Were I am a man þat hous helde, If any woman with me dwelde, þer is no frer bot he were gelde shuld com with-In my wones. For may he til a woman wynne In priueyte, he wyl not blynne Er he a childe put hir with-Inne— &amp; perchaunce two at ones! Þof he loure vnder his hode, with semblaunt quaynte &amp; mylde, If þou him trust, or dos him gode, by god, þou ert bygylde! Þai say þat þai distroye synne, &amp; þai mayntene men moste þer-Inne; For had a man slayn al his kynne, go shryue him at a frere, &amp; for lesse þen a payre of shone He wyl assoil him, clene &amp; sone, And say þe synne þat he has done his saule shal neuer dere. It semes soþe þat men sayne of hayme in many dyuers londe, Þat þat caytyfe cursed cayme first þis ordre fonde. Nou se þe soþe whedre it be swa, Þat frer carmes come of a k, Þe frer austynes come of a, frer Iacobynes of i, Of M comen þe frer menours.

Suche annuels has made þes frers so wely &amp; so gay, Þat þer may no possessioners mayntene þair array. Þam felle to lyue al on purchace, Of almes geten fro place to place; &amp; for all þat þam holpen has, shuld þai pray &amp; syng.

I was a frere ful many a day, þerfor þe soþe I wate. Bot when I sawe þat þair lyuyng Acordyd not to þair preching, Of I cast my frer cloþing &amp; wyghtly went my gate. Oþer leue ne toke I none fro ham when I went, Bot toke ham to þe deuel ychone, þe priour &amp; þe couent. Out of þe ordre þof I be gone, Apostota ne am I none; Of twelue moneþes me wanted one, &amp; odde days nyen or ten. Away to wende I made me boun, Or tyme come of professioun, I went my way þurghout þe toun In syght of many men.

Goo forth, lybell, and mekly schew thy face Afore my lordes with humble countenaunss, And pray theym all to take the to grace In appoysayll and in cheryschyng the to avaunce. ffor thow mayst expertly be provyd by prudence, Among all discrete men hauyng sapyence, ffor oone of þe best þat may be thought ffor þe welth of ynglond, yf it be well sowthe. ffor ther ys no reme in no maner degree Butt they haue nede to oure englysshe commodyte; And þe cawse þeroff I wyll to yow expresse, The wich ys soth as þe gospell of the masse. Ther ys noothir pope, Emperowre, nor kyng, Bysschop, cardynal, or any men leuyng, Of what condicion or what maner degree, Duryng theyre leuyng þei must haue thynges iij: Mete, drynk, &amp; cloth to euery mannes sustynaunce.

And paynymys also we my?th mak theym ful tame; ffor þe cause we take no hed we be mykyll to blame. for of all þe pepyll þat be lyuyng on grounde, To praye &amp; to please god we be most bownde. ffor thow þei haue met, drynke, in euery kyngges londe, Yet they lack cloth, as y vndyrstonde. And for to determyn þat þe trouthe ys soe, Lestyn wel to me &amp; ye moste acord þerto. ffor þe marchauntes comme oure wollys for to bye, Or elles þe cloth þat is made þeroff sykyrly, Oute of dyuerse londes fer byyond þe see, To haue thyse merchaundyss into theyre contre. ffrom arteyse, pekardy, henaude, &amp; normandy, Bretayne, fraunse, petowe, and barry, Gasscoyne, gyon, and also aragun, Portyngale, spayne, &amp; nauerun; Castyle, Cesyle, coleyn, &amp; swethyn, Pruse-londe, florence, venyse, &amp; Iene, Melane, catelony, and all ytally, Bewme, hungry, greke, and gret turky; And many moo londes þat I can-not neuene. But y dar sey all þat be vnþer heuyn, Both crystyn and hethyn of all maner degreys, They haue nede to oure Englysshe commodyteis. Therfor let not owre woole be sold for now?te, Neyther oure cloth, for they must be sowth; And in especyall restrayne strayttly þe wool, That þe comyns of thys land may wyrke at the full. And yf any wool be sowlde of thys londe, Lete yt be of the worst, both to ffre &amp; bonde; And noon other in no maner wyse, ffor many dyuerse cawsys, as y can deuyse. Yf þe woole be corse, the cloth is mykyll the worse; Yet in-to lytyll þei putt owte of purse As mych for gardyng, spynnyng, and weuyng, ffullyng, rowyng, dyyng, and scheryng. And yet when such cloth ys all ywrowte, To the maker it waylyth lytyll or now?tte; The pryce ys sympyll—þe cost ys neuer the lesse: They þat wyrkkyd soche wooll in wytte be lyke a nasse! The costes into lytyll trewly at þe fulle Ys as myche as yt were maad of þe fyne woll, Yet a ?erde of þat oon ys worth v of þat other. Bettyr can-not I seye, thow yt were to my brother! Take hed to my lesson þat y haue schewyd here, ffor yt ys necessary to euery clothyer, And þe most preuayle to theym þat may be fownde, Yf they wyll take hede þerto and yt vndyrstonde. A ordynaunce wolde be maad for þe poore porayle, That in thyse dayes haue but lytyll auayle; Þat is to sey for spynners, carders, wevers also, ffor toukers, dyers, and schermyn þereto. for in thyse dayes þer is a hewsaunce, Þat puttyth þe pore pepyll to grett hynderaunce, By a strange mene that is late in londe Begun and usyd, as y vndyrstonde, By merchaundes &amp; cloth-makers—for godys sake take kepe!— Þe wyche makyth þe poreyll to morne &amp; wepe. Lytyll þei take for theyre labur, yet halff ys merchaundyse. Alas! for rewth, yt ys gret pyte! Þat they take for vjd, yt ys dere ynow of iij; And thus þei be defrawdyd in euery contre; The pore haue þe labur, the ryche the wynnyng. This acordythe now?te, it is a heuy partyng. Butt to uoyde fraude, and sett egallyte, þat syche wyrkfolk be payd in good mone, ffrom þis tyme forth by suffycyent ordynaunce þat þe poreyll no more be putte to such greuaunce. ffor and ye knew þe sorow and heuyness Of the pore pepyll leuyng in dystress, How þei be oppressyd in all maner of thyng, In yeuyng theym to myche weythe into þe spynnyng. ffor ixli, I wene, they schall take xij. This is very trewth, as y know my-selff; Theyre wages be batyd, theyre weyte ys encresyd; Þus the spynners &amp; carders auaylys be all seasyd. Yt were profytabyl also, &amp; exspedyent for oure kyng, And a gret awawntage of mych wynnyng, And a gret enscherychyng to all þe comynalte Þat dwell abowte ther þat þe mynys be, The wych haue yt in usage To myne in þe erth to gete theyre sustynaunce, Þer myght be had x tymys more wynnyng Than ys now-adayees with good gouernyng. ffor and þer were a myntte ordeynyd ny þerby, And a ordynaunce maad þerto sykyrly, That all the syluer, whan yt fynyd were, Thether schold be bro?tth and yconyd there. And mony to be caryyd into a-nother place, But oonly to be coynyd in a schort space, Wherby þat the wyrkfolk myght trewly be payd; Then I dar sey yt wold not be denayyd, But ayenst oon man then schuld ye haue x, for the good payment of the wyrkmen; And the moe peopyll þat wyrk in þe mynys, The more syluer schuld be had vp at all tymys. And thus þe kyng schold be enrychyd for his parte More than he is now, I dare playnly Ioparte, After the rate of theyre gret wynnyng, The wich schold be to hym a profytable thyng. And thus þis lond may be enryched ageyn— The kyng, þe lordes, and all maner of men, Knyghtis, squyers, and all þe comynalte, They may playnly voyd all pouerte. And so to contynow owtt of heuyness, fro penowry &amp; nede &amp; to be put owt of dystress, And for to cawse owre enmyss be þis ordynaunss To seke loue &amp; pese withowtt varyaunss. And ffull fayne þat they may be subyet to þis lond, Yf we kepe þe woollys straytly owt of theyre hond; ffor by þe endraperyng þeroff they haue theyre sustynaunce, And thus owre enmys be supportyd to owre gret hynderaunce. And therfor, for þe loue of god in trinyte, Conceyue well these matorss, &amp; scheryssh þe comynalte; That theyre pouer leuyng synfull, &amp; aduersyte May be altratyd vnto welth, rychess, &amp; prosperyte. Here endyth þe boke of ynglysshe polysye, That may cause all þe world yt to obeye; Ther may no man denye but þat it ys soth, ffor euery man must haue met, drynk, and cloth. THE FALLS OF PRINCES 71.

THE LAMENT OF THE DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER (1441) Cambridge Univ. MS. Hh.4.12 Thorow-owt a palys as I gan passe, I herd a lady make gret mone; And euer she syghyd and said, “alas! All erthly ioy is fro me gone. ffor I am left my-self alone, And all my frendys fro me thei flee; Alas, I am full well of wone— All women may be ware by me. “All women that in thys world art wroght, By me they may ensample take; ffor I that was browght up of noght, A prince me chese to be hys make. My souerayn lord thus to forsake It was a dulfull desteny; Alas to syght how shold I slake— All women may be ware by me. “I was so hygh vpon the whele, My owne astate I cowd not know; The gospell accordeth there-to ful well: Who wyll be hygh, he shall be lowe. Who may the whele of fortune trowe— It is but vayne and vanite? The flowrys of my medow ben downe mowe— All women may be ware by me. “With welth, wele, and worthinesse, I was be-sett on euery syde; Of glowcestre I was duchesse, Of all men I was magnifyed. As lucifer fell downe for pride, So fell I from felicite; I had no grace my-self to gwyde— All women may be ware by me. “Sum tyme I was in riche aray, Ther myght no princes be my pere; In clothys of gold and garmentys gay, Me thowght ther was no thyng to dere. I purchast fast from yere to yere, Of poore men I had no pite. Now ar my wittys all in were— All women may be ware by me. “Alas, what was myn auenture So sodaynly downe forto fall, That had all thyng vndyr my cure, Encline and croke whan I wold call? ffadyr of heuyn celestiall, Of my complaint haf thow pite; ffor now am I worst of all— All women may be ware by me. “All women that ar ware of wark, My mischeue may ?e haf in mynd; To gef credence to any clerk; ffor so dyd I, and that I fynd I wrowght agayne all course of kynd, And lost my crede for cruelte; Ther may no blys my balys vnbynd— All women may be ware by me. “My clerkys callyd up and downe, All was but mischeue that they ment; Owre souerayn lord and kyng with crowne Hym to distroye was owre entent. All-myghty god omnipotent, He wyst full well owre cruelte; Loo, for such harmys I am now schente— All women may be ware by me. “Alas, that euer I wroght treson! But cursyd counsell euer worth it woo. I was mekyll agayne the crowne, Alas, the while that I dyd soo! My best frend now is my foo, My owne dere lord I dar not see; Alas, that we shuld twynne in too— All women may be ware by me. “By-fore the counsell of thys lond, At westmynster vpon a day, fful carefully there gan I stond; A word for me durst noo man say. Owre leche lord with-owtyn delay Was there, he myght both here and see; And in hys grace I put me ay— All women may be ware by me. “Hys grace to me was euermore gayne, All-thow I had done gret offence; The law wold I had ben slayne, And sum men dyd ther diligence. That worthi prynce of hys prudence Of my persone had pyte; Honour to hym with all reuerence— All women may be ware by me. “I cam by-fore the spiritualte; Two cardinallys and bisshoppys fiue, And other clerkys of gret degre Examynd me of all my lyffe. And opynly I dyd me shryffe That I had dolt with sorcery; They put me to my penance belyve— All women may be ware by me. “Thorow-owt london in many a strete, Of tho that were most principall, I went barefote vpon my fote, That sum tyme rode there ful royall. Kyng of heuen and lord of all, At thyn owne wyll so mut it be; The synne of pride wyl haf a falle— All women may be ware by me. “ffarewell, london, and hafe good day, At the I take my leve thys tyde; ffarewell, Grenewyche, for euer and ay, ffarewell, fayre place upon temys syde! ffarewell, all welth in world so wyde, I am sygned where I shall be; At lerpole there must I nedes byde— All women may be ware by me. “ffarewell, damaske and clothys of gold, ffarewell, velwette and clothys in grayne, ffarewell, my clothys so manyfold, ffarewell, I se ?ow neuer agayne; ffarewell, my lord and souerayne, ffarewell, it may no bettyr be; Owre partyng is a priuy payne— All women may be ware by me. “ffarewell, all mynstralcy and song, ffarewell, all worldly daliance, ffarewell, I wote I haf do wrong And all I wyte mysgouernance. Now list me nedyr prike ne prawnce, My pride is put to pouerte, That bothe in englond and in fraunce All women may be ware by me. “ffarewell now, all lustinesse; All worldly Ioy I here forsake; I am so full of heuynesse, I wot not to whom complaynt to make. But to hym I wyll me take, That for us was put upon a tree, And in prayers wyll I wache and wake— All women may be ware by me.” Explicit. 73. EPITAPH FOR THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER (1447) Epitaphium eiusdem Ducis Gloucestrie. Harley MS. 2251 Souerayne Immortal, everlastyng god, Almyghti most mercyful, verray welle of grace, Late nat of thy vengeaunce the dredeful rod Towche vs to-fore for gilt of oure trespas; How-be-it we synne, yit graunt vs tyme and space Oure forfetes to bewayle while oure lyf may dure, Sith worship, riches, and al thyng shal pas— Se be hym buryed in this sepulture. O secrete counceyle, o divyne purviaunce, O nature, thy principles how hastow conveyed, O elementes iiij sette in grete variaunce, Yowre stryf contynuel hath my lord downe leyd. Allas, for his lyf why ne had ye purveyed Hym to conserve, whiche for vs all had cure; But syth thy wille, lord, may nat be geynseyd, Have mercy on hym buryed in this sepulture. Compleyne al yngland this goode lordis deth, ffor and ye considre youre causes ben right grete, He hath with his wisdom, while hym lasted breth, And with his richesse made the grete hete Of oure enemyes to kele, wold they werre or trete; But ageyn mortalite there lith no recure; Now lord, syn nonother remedye may be gete, Have mercy on hym beryed in this sepulture. Thy mercyes bene grettest, and his wag grettest also, Thow foryaf oure trespas and so dide he his certayne; Of mercy and pite ther were suche no mo. And syth thy mercy, lord of grace, is nat bareyne, Late it be fertible to hym that dide his peyne To sue thi steppis folowyng the scripture By dauid seyde and notified ful pleyne, Have mercy on hym beryed in this sepulture. Remembre, goode lord, that to the body of man Thow inspired a soule to thyne owne lykenesse, And sythen is he turned into that thow began, In-to the erth, meane I (as thi-self dost witnesse), Take thyn ymage and with thy aungels dresse In thy perfite Ioye, euerlastyng to endure, Turnyng from the terestre vale, the contrey of derknesse, And have mercy on hym buryed in this sepulture. Put ferre from hym the prince of derknesse, And take hym neere—he is thyn owne alye, fforged of thyn hand (thow knowest it expresse), And nought of straunge goddis, but only of the. Although he synned thurgh fragilite Of ygnoraunce, as fil his aduenture, He denyed the neuer, conceyve his humilite, And have mercy on hym buryed in this sepulture. Dispice nat thy part, that with thy precious bloode Shed on the crosse and boughte so deere, And for the love of hir that at thy feete stoode— Thy moder, I meane—and Iohn that was hir feere. Whan the sharp spere went thy hert so neere, That thurgh thy deth thow madest vs al sure, Crowne hym in hevene, that in his dayes had no pere, And have mercy on hym buryed in this sepulture. Now blessid lady, for thy Ioyes fyve, Specialy whan gabriel dide his glad message, Which fest he honowred terme of his lyf, ffailyng neuer hardily to his vttremest age. Now shewe thy bounte, lift vp thy fayre visage Vnto thy sone so meke and demure, To defend his werk, the printe of his ymage, And prayed for hym buryed in this sepulture. Comend hym to thi sone, as he dide the to Iohn, And as he was to the, be thow to hym wardeyn; As his singuler trust was to the alon, So quyte the to hym, as his lady souerayne. Now blessid virgyne, of hym have no disdayne; He was noble in vertue as wele as in nature; And if he be distressed with any temporal peyne, Yit pray for hym buryed in this sepulture. He was verray fader and protectour of the land, Ingland, I meane, that is thyn owne dowarye; Neuer man had more ?ele, as I vndrestond, Ne redyer to redresse alle transgressis by and by; I dare wele say it sat his hert so ny. Cowde none make hym in any Ioye to endure Vnto his lyf passed; therfor to the I cry, So pray for hym buryed in this sepulture. Behold of thy chirche the myghti piler stronge, Euer to withstande and redy to bataile; Ageyne the chirche, enemys he wold suffre no wronge Vnto hir to be done, whiles he myght aught availe; ffor he hath emprised many a travaile Opinly, without shame or discomfiture; Rescow hym, therfor, whan his enemyes wil assaile, And pray for hym buryed in this sepulture. And like as he endured with these graces thre— With wisdam, with riches, and with nobley— So blessid lady, we al beseche the, Knele before thy sone and to hym prey, Whan of Iugement shal approche the dredeful day, He may be endowed beforne his figure Impassible, Immortal, with clerenesse lastyng ay— God it hym graunt buryed in this sepulture. “Studye, labour, and merit for comvne wele; ffor reward, smal thank, or worship in recompense Departith from me; go your wele, fare-wele. Sollicitith other fallen in suche diligence. Oure lord hath clepid me vnto his divyne presence, ffro this short lyf to that euer shal dure; My soule to hym I yield at my goyng hens, To the erth my body, as for my sepulture.” 74. EXAMPLES OF MUTABILITY MS. Rawlinson C.813 (Sum. Cat. No. 12653) Musyng vppon the mutabilite off worldlye changes &amp; grett vnstablenes, &amp; me remembering howe grett aduersite I haue seen falle to men off highe noblenes— furst welthe, and then ageyn distres, nowe vppe, nowe downe, as fortune turnethe hur whele, Best is, me thinke, for mannys sikernes to trust In god &amp; labour to doo well. Wee nede not nowe to seke the cronicle? olde off the romans, nor bockas tragedye, to rede the ruyen &amp; fallys manyffolde off prynces grett, putt to dethe &amp; miserye In sondrye landes, for wee haue hardelye here In thys lande with-In the xx yere as wonder? change? seen before our eye as euer I trowe before thys any were. Off whiche I shall reherse suche as I can— thoughe I In ordre sett them nott a-right. &amp; as I trowe a duches furst began, whiche Elinor off Cobeham sumtyme hight or she were weddyd to that famose knyght off glocestur, the noble duke humffrey, whose soll Iesu bringe to þat Ioyffull light, that you hym bothe humblye beseche &amp; praye. Thys ladye was soo proude &amp; highe of harte that she hur-selffe thought pereles of estate, and yet higher fayn she wold haue starte; butt sodenlye she fell, as was hur fate, &amp; was arested, all dismayde and mate, for sorcerye and eke for suspection of treason wrought ageynst the king algate, And theruppon committed vnto prisone. And after brought to the courte spirituall before the bisshoppes; and ther off sorcerye founden gyltye In poyntes specyall. she was InIoyned In london opynlye to doo hur penaunce, And soo full petyously she itt perfformed; &amp; after was she sent vnto a castell to abide perpetuallye. And soo she dyd tyll dethe awey hur hent. The noble duke of somersett, Iohn, whome all brytayne and also normandye hadde In grett drede (&amp; his enemye? euerichon) for his manhode, puissance, &amp; cheualrye, when he was weddyd &amp; In estate most hye, In his best age (right as his fortune was) The bull to gronde hym cast cruellye that after soone he dyed: suche was hys grace. The noble duke off whiche I spoke before— I meane humffrey of glocestre alsoo, whiche off thys lande was lymyted Protector, &amp; made the duke of burgoyne &amp; muche moo To flee from caleys vnto his highe honor— vppon a tale made by a bisshoppe, a brybor, a wretched prest as deeffe nere as a stoune, whiche he shulde haue harde as a confessor. And to the kinge he vttered itt anon. wherfore att burye in a full parlyament by a grett lorde, or he came to the towne, he was arrestede by the commandement off kynge henrye, for suspection off treason thought and wrought ageynst his crowne. for shame and angwishe off which, Ieloussye I-toke hym sone after, &amp; soo lowe brought hym downe that In short while after I-caused hym to dye. 75.

Our ship is launched from the grounde, Blessed be god, both faire and sownde! Our maryners han the shypmen founde, By þere taklynge will a-byde. This noble shyp made of good tree, Our souerayne lord, kynge henry. God gyde hym from aduersyte, Where þat he go or ryde. The shyp was charged with a mast; Crased it was, it myght not last. Now hath he one þat wol not brest— The old is leyde on syde. Thys fayre mast, this myghty yeard, Of whom fals shrewes be a-fered, hys name of ryght is prince Edward— long myght he with vs a-byde. The ship hath closed hym a lyght To kepe her course in wey of ryght— A fyre cressant þat berneth bryght, With fawte was neuer spyed. Thys good lyght, þat is so clere, Call y the duke of exceter, Whos name in trouþe shyned clere; Hys worshyp spryngeth wyde. Thys shyp hath a sterne full good, hem to gyde in ebbe &amp; flood, A-geyne þer wawes boþe wild &amp; wode That rynneth on euery syde. The sterne that on þe shype is sette Ys þe duke Somerset; ffor ragged rokkes he woll not lette To sterre in ebbe and eke in tyde. Ther is a sayle-yeard full good and sure, To þe shyp a grete tresour; ffor alle stormes it wolle endure— It is trusty atte nede.

The Duke of Bokyngham thys stay is he, Thys shrowdes be sure in thare degre; Devenshyre, &amp; Grey, &amp; becheham the free, And scales with them in tyde. The shyp hath a well good sayle, Of fyne canvas þat woll not fayle, With bonet iii for to travayle, That mekell beth of pryde. This good sayle, y vndurstond, The Erle of Northumberland, Ros, clyfford, and Egremond— The trouþe is not to hyde. Ther is a toppe þe mast on hyght, The shyp to defende in all hys ryght; With his foomen when he schall fyght, They dare hym not a-byde. The Erle of Shrovesbury þe toppes name, He kepeth þe shype from harme and blame; The Erle of Wylchyre, one of þe same, That kepeth þe shyp from drede. Thys good shype hath ankers thre, Of bether mettel þer may non be, To strenthe þe shyp be londe and se, When he woll stop hys tyde. The furst anker, hole &amp; sounde, he is named þe lord beamond; Willys and Ryveres trouþe yn þem found, In worship þey hem gyde.

RECONCILIATION OF HENRY VI AND THE YORKISTS (1458) Cotton MS.

Wisdom &amp; wellthe, with all plesaunce, May rightful regne, and prosperite; For loue hath vnderlaide wrathful veniaunce. Reioise, Anglond, oure lordes acorded to be. Reiose, and thanke god for euermore, For now shal encrese thi consolacion; Oure enemyes quaken &amp; dreden ful sore That peas is made there was diuision. Which to them is a gret confusion, And to vs ioi and felicite. God hold hem longe in euery season, That Anglond may reioise in concord &amp; vnite. Now is sorowe with shame fled into ffraunce, As a felon that hath forsworn this londe; Love hath put out malicious gouernaunce, In euery place bothe fre &amp; bonde. In Yorke, In Somerset, as I vnderstonde, In Warrewik also is loue &amp; charite, In Sarisbury eke, &amp; in Northumbrelande, That euery man may reioise in concord &amp; vnite. Egremown and Clifford, with other forsaide, Ben set in the same opynyon. In euery quarter love is thus laide; Grace &amp; wisdom hath thus the dominacion. Awake, welth, &amp; walke in this region, Rounde aboute in tovn &amp; Cite; And thanke them that brought hit to this conclusion. Reioise, Anglond, to concorde &amp; vnite. At Poules in london, with gret renoun, On oure ladi day in lente this peas was wrought; The kyng, the Quene, with lordes many oone, To worshyp that virgine as thei ought, Wenten a procession, and spariden right nought, In sighte of alle the Comynalte, In token that love was in herte and thought. Reiose, Anglond, in concorde &amp; vnite. Ther was bytwyn hem lovely contynaunce, Whiche was gret ioy to all that ther were; That long tyme hadden be in variaunce, As frendes for euer that had be in fere.

Oure Soueraigne lord kyng, god kepe alwey, The Quene, &amp; the Archbisshop of Canterbury, And the bisshop of Wynchestre, Chanceller of Anglond, And other that han labured to this loue-day; God preserue hem, we pray hertly, And london, for thei ful diligently Kepten the peas in trowbel &amp; aduersite, To bryng in reste thei labured ful truly. Reiose, Anglond, in concorde &amp; vnite. Of thre thynges I praise the worshipful Cite: The first, þe true faithe þat thei haue to þe kynge; The seconde, of love to þe Comynalte; The thrid, goud rule for euermore kepynge; The which god maynteyn euermore durynge, And save þe Maier and all þe worthi Cite; And þat is amys god brynge to amendynge, That Anglond may reioise to concorde &amp; vnite. 80.

A REMEMBRANCE OF HENRY VI (1492) BY JAMES RYMAN Cambridge Univ. MS. Ee.1.12 O good Herry, the sixte by name, Bothe of Inglond, ye, &amp; of Fraunce, A kyng thou were of royall fame And of full worthy gouernaunce, Full of mercy without vengeaunce, Wherfore in blisse the king of grace Hath grauntid the a Ioyefull place.

ADVICE TO THE COURT, I (1450) Cotton Rolls ii.23 ffor feer or for fauour of any fals man, Loose not the loue of alle þe commynalte! Be ware and sey, by seint Iulian, Duke, Iwge, baron, Archebisshop and he be, He woll repent it with-in þis monthes thre. Let ffolke accused excuse theym-selff, and þey can; Reseyue no good, let soche bribry be; Support not theym this wo by-gan, And let theym suche clothis as þey span, And take fro þeym þer wages and þer fee, Or, by god and sent Anne, Som must go hens, hit may non othere weys be, And els is lost all þis lond and we. Hong vp suche men to oure souerayn lord, That euer counseld hym with fals men to be acord. Anno milleno domini centum quaterno L simplex pleno caveat omnis homo. 86. ADVICE TO THE COURT, II (1450) Cotton Rolls ii.23 Ye that haue the kyng to demene, And ffrauncheses gif theym ageyne, or els I rede ye fle. ffor ye haue made the kyng so pore That now he beggeth fro dore to dore— Alas, hit shuld so be! Tom of say, and daniel both, To be-gyn be not to loth, þen shall ye haue no shame. Who will not, he shall not chese, And his life he shall lese— No reson will vs blame. Trowth and pore men ben appressed, And myscheff is nothyng redressed; þe kyng knowith not all. Thorow-out all Englond, On tho þat holden þe fals bond Vengeaunce will cry and call. The traytours wene they ben so sly, Þat no man can hem aspy; We can do them no griffe. We swere by hym that harwed hell, Þay shall no lenger in eresy dwell, Ne in þer fals beleve. So pore a kyng was neuer seen, Nor richere lordes all by-dene; þe commvnes may no more. Þe lorde say biddeth holde hem down, Þat worthy dastard of renown; he techith a fals loore. Suffolk normandy hath swold. to gete hyt a-gayn he is bold. how acordeth þese to in on? And he wenyth with-outen drede To make the kyng to avowe his dede, and call hit no treson. We trow þe kyng be to leere To sell both men and lond in feere; hit is agayn reson. But yif the commyns of Englond Helpe þe kyng in his fond, Suffolk woll bere þe crown! Be ware, kyng henre, how þou doos; Let no lenger þy traitours go loos— þey will neuer be trewe. Þe traytours are sworn all to-gedere To holde fast as þey were brether; let hem drynk as þey han brewed. Þe chaunselere þat last was hath staffes take, Blank charters, to don vs wrake, no nombre of them, hit is ferd. He woll not suffre þe clerkes preche; Trowthe in no wise he will not teche; he is þe deuels shapard. Þis bill is trewe. who will say nay, In smythfeld syng he a day, and þe helpe of þe rode. That traitours shall provid; More reson can not be mevid; þer shall hit be made good. 87. TAKE GOOD HEED Trinity Coll. Dublin MS. 432 Awake, lordes, awake &amp; take goode hede! ffor som þat speke ful fayre, þei wolde ?our evil spede; Þou? þei pere in your presence with a fayre face, And her tunge chaunged, þe hert is as it was. Þei seyne in þeire assemble, “it is a wondre thyng To se þe Rose in wyntre so fressh for to spryng.” And many barked atte bere þat now be ful stylle; ?it þei wol hym wyrye, if þei might haue her wylle. But of your fewe fomen no thing þat ye drede, ffor þe comyns ben youres, euer at youre nede. ?it a seege wold be set, þe falte to take &amp; holde, ffor oon scabbed shepe may enfecte al a folde. Trust not to moche in the fauour of youre foos, ffor þei be double in wirking, as þe worlde gos, Promysing feithfully obeisaunce to kepe, But perfite loue in þeire hertis is leyde for to slepe; And þou? þei were þe rose, or þe ragged staffe, Þei rought neuer how sone, in feiþe, þat ?e starffe. ffor fyre &amp; water to-gider kyndeling be brought, It passeþ mannes power, be god þat me bought. Nor two fases in a hode is neuer to tryst. Beþ wele war be-fore, &amp; þenk of “had I wyst.” ffor þei hopen &amp; tristen to here of a day, To se þe rose &amp; þe lion brought to a-bay With þe egel &amp; þe bere, þat worþi be in fight. ffrom þat infortune, preserue you god almight! And lat not youre sauegardes be to liberalle To your foos þat be turnyng euer as a balle; And siþe fortune haþe set you hye on hir whele And in youre comyns love, loveþ ye hem as wele. ffor many þat were þe chayne on hir sleve Wold ful fayne youre lyves be-reve; And som þat were þe ragged bottis Had lever were þe stafford knottis. But what þei mene, no man it wottis, Þerfore I counsel, eschewe þeire lottis. To telle you more it is no nede, By counsel goode ?it take goode hede, ffor a cristmas gestenyng, as clerkis rede, At on-set stevyn is quyt, in dede. Wherfore I counsel you sempely as I can, Of youre disposicion telliþ not euery man. Miche is in my mynde, no more is in my penne: ffor þis shuld I be shent, might som men it kenne. But pray we al to god þat died on a spere, To saue þe rose, þe lyon, þe egle, &amp; þe bere, With al oþer lordes, trewe to youre assent; Her sheld be euer god omnipotent. Amen. 88. Balat set upponne the yates of Caunterbury. (1460) John Speed Davies MS. In the day of faste and spirituelle afflixione, The celestialle influence on bodyes transytory Set asyde alle prophecyes, and alle commixtione Of iujementys sensualle to ofte in memory. I reduced to mynde the prophete Isay, Consideryng Englond to God in greuous offence; With wepyng ye, this text I fonde in his story: “Omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” “Regnum Anglorum regnum Dei est,” As the Aungelle to seynt Edward dede wyttenesse. Now regnum Sathane, it semethe, reputat best. For filii scelerati haue broughte it in dystresse— This preuethe fals wedlock and periury expresse— Fals heyres fostred, as knowethe experyence, Vnryghtewys dysherytyng with false oppresse, Sic, “omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” A planta pedis, fro the pore tylyer of the lond Ad verticem of spiritualle eke temporalle ennoynted crown, Grace ys withdrawe and Goddys mercyfulle hand; Exalted ys falsehod, trowthe ys layde adoune; Euery reame cryethe owte of Engelondes treson. O falshod, with thy colored presence, Euer shulle we syng duryng thy season: “Omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” “Omne regnum in se divisum,” sayethe dyuyne Scrypture, “Shall be desolate”; than folewethe translacione Into the handes of theyre enemyes—Jewes arn figure. And now ys Englond in lyk reputacione, In wey to be conquered—truste it for sewre! Jhesu, for thy mercy and thy noble reuerens, Reforme vs to goodnesse and condicione pure, For “omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” Harry, oure souerayne and most Crystyne kyng, His trew bloode hathe flemed bothe be swerde and exyle; What prynce by thys rewle may haue long enduryng, That also in moste pouert hath be long whyle? Tho bestys that thys wroughte to mydsomer haue but a myle! But euer mornethe Engelond for ham that be hens, Wythe languysshyng of herte, rehersyng my scyle, “Omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” Jonathas ys ded that Dauid shuld restore To the presence of the kyng, vnyte to make, “Murum pro domo Israel”; presthode dar no more Put hymself forthe, his fat benefyce he shuld forsake. Mercyfulle God, it ys tyme thow for vs awake! “Mercenarius fugit,” ne wylle make resistence, He ferethe the wolf that wolde hys bonys crake. “Omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” Tempus ys come falshede to dystroy, Tempus eradicandi the wedes fro the corne, Tempus cremandi the breres that trees noye, Tempus evellendi the fals hunter with his horne, Tempus miserendi on por alle to torne, Tempus ponendi falsnes in perpetuelle absence, Thoroughe whom we syngyn bothe euyne and morne, “Omne caput languidum, et omne cor merens.” Send hom, most gracious Lord Jhesu, most benygne, Sende hoom thy trew blode vn-to his propre veyne, Richard, duk of York, Job thy seruaunt insygne, Whom Sathan not cesethe to sette at care and dysdeyne; But by the preserued, he may nat be slayne. Sette hym ut sedeat in principibus, as he dyd before, And so to oure newe songe, Lorde, thyn erys inclyne, “Gloria, laus et honor tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor!” Edwarde, Erle of Marche, whos fame the erthe shalle sprede, Richard, Erle of Salisbury, named prudence, Wythe that noble knyghte and floure of manhode Richard, erle of Warrewyk, sheelde of oure defence, Also lytelle Fauconbrege, a knyghte of grete reuerence; Jhesu ham restore to thayre honoure as thay had before, And euer shalle we syng to thyn Hyghe Excellence, “Gloria, laus et honor Tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor!” No prynce, alle thyng consydered, wythe honoure In alle thyng requysyte to a kynges excellence Better may lyue—serche any worthy predecessoure; Yet hastow, souuerayne lord, in these lordes absence Of alle thaym to a kyng ryghte resonable expens; Thay shalle come agayne and rekere for the scoore, And thow shalt syng wythe vs thys verrey trew sens, “Gloria, laus et honor Tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor!” The deed man gretethe yow welle, That ys iust, trew as steele, With verray good entent; Alle the Reame of Englond Sone to louse from sorowes bond By ryghte indifferent iugement. To the ryghte Worshypfulle Cyte of Caunterbury. 89. THE BATTLE OF NORTHAMPTON (1460) Trinity Coll. Dublin MS. 432 Of all mennys disposicion naturall Philisophyrs wryten in euery place, That affter the bodyes celestiall The Erthely body his wirkyn hase; Some tyme disposid it is to solace, Som tyme the contrary to hevynesse, And som tyme, by enspeciall grace, Sorow is turned into gladnesse. And ensaumple here-of I take witnesse Of certeyn persones þat late exiled were, Whos sorow is turned into ioyfulnesse, Þe rose, þe fetyrlok, þe egle, &amp; þe bere. Gret games in Inglond sum tyme þer were, In hauking, huntyng, &amp; fisshing in euery place Amonge lordes with shelde &amp; spere; Prosperite in reme þan reignyng wase. Where-of god of his speciall grace, Heryng þe peple crying for mercye, Considering þe falsehode in euery place, Gaue infleweinz of myrþe into bodyes on hye. The which in a berward lighted preuelye, Edward, yong of age, disposed in solace, In hauking &amp; huntyng to begynne meryly, To Northampton with þe bere he toke his trace. Now shal ye here a meruelous case, Allonly þorough godes ovne prouysioun; Þe berward &amp; þe bere þei did þe dogges chace, And put þeyme to flight, to gret confucioun; Þus a-gayne all naturall disposicioun To se a bere to seke his own game, But if it were of goddis mocioun Þat he shuld do þe dogges shame. Talbot ontrewe was þe oon dogges name, Bauling bewmond anodre, I vnderstonde; Þe thrid also was made ful tame, He was called bolde egremonde. When þe bereward come to þe grounde, Where he chased the forsaid leese, Amonge all oþer a buk he founde Þe which was hye &amp; fat of greese. Þe coriages berward put hym ferre in preese, To þe hunt, oure Kyng, he hyed hym ful fast; The bere for all þe dogges wold not seese, But hyed hym sone afftre swyfftly in hast. The dogges barked at hem ful fast, Þe buk set vp his hornes on hye; Þe berward, þei cryed, þei wold downe cast, The bere also, if that he come nye. The bereward asked no questioun why, But on þe dogges he set full rounde; Þe bere made the dogges to cry, And with his pawme cast þeyme to grounde. The game was done in a litel stounde, Þe buk was slayne, &amp; borne away; A-gayne þe bere þan was none hounde, But he might sporte and take his play. But þe hunt he saued from harme þat day— He þou?t neuer oþer in all his mynde— He lowted downe, &amp; at his fote lay, In token to hym that he was kynde. The bereward also, þe huntes frende, ffell downe on kne, saying with obedience: “Souereigne lord, thenk vs not vnkynde, Nor take ye this in none offence. “We haue desired to com to your presence, To oure excuse we myght not answere; All þinges were hyd from your audience, Where-fore we fled away for fere.” The hunt seid þo: “I wol you here. Ye be right welcom bothe to me; All-way I pray you to stond me nere; Ye be my frendis, I may wele se. “Stond vp, berward, welcom be ye, Gramercy of your gentyl game; ffrom you &amp; your bere I wol neuer fle, Telliþe me now, what is your name.” “Edward of march, I am þe same, Trewe to god and youre highnesse.” Þe gentyl bere seid: “with-outen blame, We haue be put in gret hevynesse.” The hunt answerid with gret mekenesse: “Þe dogges wrought agayne all kynde, Þei labored to bryng me in distresse; I was þeire mayster &amp; speciall frende. The buk ran before, þe dogges be-hynde. I folowed affter, I wist neuer why; In no place game kowde I fynde, Þe buk and þe dogges playde by &amp; by. “A gentylle dogge wol naturally His mayster love &amp; drede also; His kyndly game if he may a-spy, ffrom hym belyve he wol be goo. These curre-dogges before dyd not so; Þe buk and þey played par asent, They lapped a-wey the fatte me fro, Me to myscheue was þeire entent. “And neuer to me þei wold consent, Þe which called you euer treytours vntrewe; Tyl now þe trewe comynerys of kent Be comyn with you, falsehed to destrewe, And truþe long exiled now to renewe. Seynt thomas I þanke, in all your right, Þat gided you þis day, &amp; shewid to be trewe, So fewe men slayne in so gret a fight! “It was þe werk of god almight, Of mannesse power it might not be; Gramercy, favcon, of þi fayre flight, Þe bird from þe nest he made to fle.” To london now, þat fayre cyte, Þe hunt was brought ful reuerently; Þe berward, þe bere, þe fawcon fre, Rode a-bou?t hym full ioyefully. Thorow þat cyte right opynly Þe hunt rode, with gret gladnesse; Þe pepil reioysed inwardly, And þanked god of his goodenesse, That he likeþ with lustynesse To endewe þe hunt, oure noble kyng, And to remeve his heuynesse Which to his regall is no-þyng conservyng. The egle from london was neuer remeving, But hovid &amp; wayted vpon his pray; All his delite was euer in fisshing, Þe fisshe were closed in pyttes alway. Yit at þe last, vpon a day, Þe fisshe drewe nere vnto þe bayte; Nede haþe no lawe, þis all men say, Þe egle þerto euer layde goode wayte. To skape a-way it was ful strayte, Þe egyls birdes lay so þeyme a-bowte, Euer beholding þe falce dissayte, How from þeyme all þei wold gon oute. Þe egle li?ted &amp; made hem to loute, Þe fisshe was feynte, &amp; litell of might; ?it iiij there were, boþe gret &amp; stoute, Þe which he toke all at a flight. All þei had scaped vpon a nyght, Saue þeire skales were plucked away; Þan had þe fissh lost all here might, And litel ioy in watyr to play. Now god, þat madest both nyght &amp; day, Bryng home þe mayster of þis game, Þe duke of yorke, for hym we pray, Þat noble prynce, Richard be name, Whom treson ne falshod neuer dyd shame, But euer obedient to his souereigne; ffalsehod euer-more put hym in blame, &amp; lay awayte hym to haue sleigne. If god be with vs, who is vs agayne? He is so nowe, blessid mot he be; Of þis fortune all men may be fayne, Þat right haþe now his fre entree. Blessid be god in trinite, ffadir &amp; son &amp; holygoste, Which kepith his seruauntes in aduersite, &amp; wold not suffre þeyme to be loste. As þou art lord of mightes moste, Saue þe kyng &amp; his ryalte, And illumyn hym with þe holy goste, His reme to set in perfyt charite. Amen. 90. THE BATTLE OF TOWTON (1461) Trinity Coll. Dublin MS. 432 Now is the rose of Rone growen to a gret honoure, Therfore syng we euerychone, “I-blessid be that floure!” I warne you euerychone, for you shuld vnderstonde, There sprange a rose in rone &amp; sprad into englonde, He þat moued oure mone þorough þe grace of goddes sonde; That rose stonte alone, þe chef flour of this londe. I-blessid be the tyme that euer god sprad that floure. Blessid be þat rose ryall, that is so fressh of hewe! Almighty ihesu, blesse that soule þat þe sede sewe, And blessid be þe gardeyn þer the rose grewe; Cristes blessyng haue þei all, þat to þat rose be trewe, And blessid be þe tyme þat euer god sprad þat floure. Be-twix Cristmas &amp; candelmas, a litel before þe lent, All þe lordes of þe northe þei wrou?t by oon assent ffor to stroy þe sowthe cuntre þei did all hur entent; Had not þe rose of Rone be, al englond had be shent. I-blessid be þe tyme þat euer god sprad þat floure. Upon a shrof tuesday on a grene leede, Be-twix Sandricche &amp; saynt Albons, many man gan blede. On an aswedynsday we levid in mykel drede, Than cam þe rose of Rone downe &amp; halp vs at oure nede. Blessid be þe tyme þat euer god sprad þat floure. The norþen men made her bost, whan þei had done þat dede, “We wol dwelle in þe southe cuntrey &amp; take al þat we nede— These wifes &amp; hur doughters oure purpose shul þei spede.” Than seid þe rose of Rone, “nay, þat werk shal I for-bede!” Blessid be þe tyme þat euer god sprad þat floure. ffor to saue al englond þe rose did his entent, With Calys &amp; with loue london, with Essex &amp; with Kent, And al þe south of englond vnto þe watyr of trent. And whan he saw þe tyme best, þe rose from london went. Blessid be þe tyme þat euer god sprad þat floure. The wey into þe northe cuntre þe rose ful fast he sought; With hym went þe ragged staf, þat many man dere bought; So þan did þe white lyon—ful worthely he wrought. Almighti ihesu blesse his soule þat þo armes ought, And blessid be þe tyme þat euer god sprad þat floure. The fisshe hoke cam into þe felde with ful egre mode, So did þe cornyssh chowghe &amp; brou?t forthe all hir brode; Þer was þe blak ragged staf, þat is boþe trewe &amp; goode; Þe brideld horse; þe watyr bouge be þe horse stode. Blessid be þe tyme þat euer god spred that floure. The grehound &amp; þe hertes hede þei quyt hem wele þat day; So did þe harow of caunterbury, &amp; clynton with his kay; Þe white ship of brystow he feryd not þat fray; Þe blak ram of Couentre he said not ons nay. Blessid be þe tyme þat euer god spred þat floure. The fawcon &amp; þe fetherlok was þer that tyde; Þe blak bulle also, hym-self he wold not hyde; Þe dolfyn cam from Walys, iii carpis be his syde; The prowde libert of Salesbury, he gapid his gomes wide. Blessid be þe tyme that euer god spred that floure. The wolf cam fro Worcestre, ful sore he þou?t to lyte; Þe dragon cam fro Glowcestre, he bent his tayle to smyte; The griffen cam fro leycestre fleying in as tyte; The george cam fro Notyngham with spere for to fyte. Blessid be þe tyme that euer god spred þat floure. The boris hede fro Wyndesover with tusshes sharp &amp; kene; Þe estrich feder was in þe felde, þat many men my?t sene; The wild kat fro norhampton with hur brode nose.

TWELVE LETTERS SAVE ENGLAND (1461) Trinity Coll.

A POLITICAL RETROSPECT (1462) Soc. of Antiquaries MS. 101 To have in mynde callyng to Remembbraunse The gret wrongys doon of oold antiquitey, Unrightful heyres by wrong alyaunce Usurpyng this Royaume caused gret adversitey; Kyng Richard the secounde, high of dignytee, Whiche of Ingeland was Rightful enheritoure, In whos tyme ther was habundaunce with plentee Of welthe &amp; erthely Ioye withou?t langoure. Than cam henry of derby, by force &amp; myght, &amp; undir the colour of fals periury, He toke this rightwys kyng, goddes trew knyght, And hym in prison put perpetuelly. Pyned to deth, alas, ful pyteuxly! Holy bisshope Scrope, the blyssed confessour, In þat quarel toke hys deth ful paciently, That all the world spak of þat gret langoure. Whos deth ys a very trew evidence To all Ingeland for the iust title &amp; lyne, Which for the trowthe by tyranny &amp; violence Was put doun, and suspect hold benysyne; Many a trew lord then put to mortil fyne; Alway they have ben aboute with Rigoure The lynaige of kyng richard to undirmyne, That longe have lyved in gret langoure. God smote the said henry for hys gret fersnesse, With a lepre holdyng hym to hys end fynally, Next hym henry the fyfte, of knyghtly prowesse, Named the best of þat lyne &amp; progeny; How-be-it he regned unrightfully, ?it he upheld in Ingeland the honnour. Henry, hys sone, of Wyndesore, by gret foly, All hath retourned unto huge langoure. Callyng to mynde the fals engendred treson And myschyef? þat were in hys dayes Regnyng: The good duc of gloucestre in the season Of the parlement at Bury beyng, Was put to deth; and ay sith gret mornyng Hath ben in Ingeland, with many a scharp schoure, ffalshode, myschyef, secret synne upholdyng, Which hath caused in Engeland endele? langoure. Noo mervail þough engeland hath ben unhappy, Which hath be mysrewled ?erys sertayne; Scripture saith, “heritage holdyn wrongfully Schal never cheve, ne with the thred heyre remayne.” As hath be verified late ful playne: Where-as iij kynges have regned by erroure, The thred put ou?t &amp; the right brought agayne, Whos absence hath caused endle? langoure. Also scripture saith, “woo be to þat Regyon Where ys a kyng unwyse or Innocent.” Moreovyr it ys Right a gret abusion, A womman of a land to be a Regent— Qwene margrete I mene, þat ever hath ment To gouerne all engeland with myght and poure, And to destroye the Ryght lyne was here entent, Wherfore sche hath a fal, to here gret langour. And now sche ne rought, so þat sche myght attayne, Though all engeland were brought to confusyon; Sche and here wykked affynite certayne Entende uttyrly to destroye thys regioun; ffor with theym ys but Deth &amp; distruccioun, Robberye &amp; vengeaunce with all Rygour. Therefore all þat holde of þat oppynioun, God sende hem a schort ende with mech langour. O, it ys gretly agayne kynde and nature, An englyssh man to corrumpe hys owne nacion— Willyng straungiers for to Recure, And in Engeland to have the domynacion, Wenyng þanne to be gret of Reputacion, fforsothe they þat soo hope, least schalbe theyre poure; He that woold be high schalbe undir subiecion, And the fyrst þat schal repente the langoure. Wherfore I lykken England to a gardayne, Which þat hath ben ouergrowen many yere With wedys, which must be mowen doune playne, And þan schul the pleasant swete herbes appere. Wherfore all trewe englyssh peuple, pray yn fere ffor kyng Edward of Rouen, oure comfortoure, That he kepe Iustice and make wedis clere, Avoydyng the blak cloudys of langoure. A gret signe it ys þat god lovyth þat knyght; ffor all thoo þat woold have destroyed hym utterly, All they ar myschyeved &amp; put to flyght. Than remembre hys fortune with chevalry, Which at Northamptoun gate the victory, And at mortimers crosse he had the honnour; On palme sonday he wan the palme of glorye, And put hys enemyes to endele? langour. And dreve hys adversary ou?t of the land; Aftyr cam to london and was crouned kyng. Ryght late god ?af hym grace to undirstonde The fals traytours agayn hym ymagynynge. The prophecie saith, there schal dere hym noo þinge; he it ys þat schal wynne castell, toune, and toure; Alle Rebellyous undyr he schal hem brynge, Willyng to hys highenesse any langoure. Richard, the Erl of Warwyk, of knyghthode Lodesterre, borne of a stok þat evyr schalbe trewe, Havyng the name of prowes &amp; manhoode, Hath ay ben Redy to helpe and Resskewe kyng Edward, in hys right hym to endewe; The commens þerto have redy euery houre The voix of the peuple, the voix of Jhesu, Who kepe &amp; preserue hym from all langoure. Now blyssed saint george, pray the vierge Immaculat, to be good mediatrix, praying here sonne That Edward of Rouen may be victorieux &amp; fortunat, With all the trew lordes of hys regioun, That they may se a good way &amp; direction To make peas in Engeland, þat Riche &amp; pouer May Ioyfully synge at the conclusyon, Welcom euerlastyng Ioie, and farewal langoure! 94.

Cat. No. 21669) Crist, crowned Kyng, that on Cros didest, And art comfort of all care, þow kynd go out of cours, With thi halwes in heuen heried mote thu be, And thy worshipfull werkes worshiped euere, That suche sondry signes shewest vnto man In dremyng, in drecchyng, &amp; in derk swevenes, Wherwith that thei ben ware &amp; witterly knowen Of care and of comfort þat comyng is here-after. This I sey be my-self, so saue me our lord, Be a metyng that y met in a morowe slepe, Hevy &amp; hidows, y hight you, forsoth, And the most merveylous that y met euere. And ye like to leer &amp; listen awhile, As y may in my mynde this metynge reherce, Sekerly and shortly þe soth y shall you shewe Of this dredefull dreme—deme as you likes. Ones y me ordeyned, as y haue ofte doon, With frendes and felawes, frendemen and other, And caught me in a company on corpus cristi even Six other vij myle oute of Suthampton, To take melodye and mirthes among my makes, With redyng of romaunces, and reuelyng among. The dym of the derknesse drowe into the west, And began for to spryng in the grey day; Than lift y vp my lyddes &amp; loked in the sky And knewe by the kende cours hit clered in þe est. Blyve y busked me doun and to bed went, For to comfort my kynde and cacche a slepe. Swythe y swyed in a sweem þat y swet after; So my spirit in a spaas so sore was y-set, Me thought that y houed an high on an hill, And loked doun on a dale deppest of othre. Ther y sawe in my sight a selcouthe peple— The multitude was so moche it myght not be noumbred. Me thought y herd a crowned kyng of his comunes axe A soleyn subsidie to susteyne his werres, To be rered in the reaume, as reson requyred, Of suche as were seemly to suffre the charge; That they that rekened were riche by reson and skyle Shuld pay a parcell for here pouere neighbowres. This ordenaunce he made in ease of his peple. With that a clerk kneled adoun &amp; carped these wordes: “Liege lord, yif it you like to listen a while, Sum sawes of salomon y shall you shew sone, Besechyng you of your souerainte that y myght be suffred To shewe you my sentence in singuler noumbre— To peynte it with pluralites my prose wolde faile; To pike a thonke with plesaunce my profit were but simple.” Than the kyng of his curtesie comaunded hym to ryse, To stonde and sey what hym semed and knele no lenger. Than he seid, “sir, crowned kyng, thou knowest well þyself. Thi-self hast lyfe, lyme, and lawes for to keep; Yif þou be chief Iustice, iustifie the trouthe; And rule the be reson, and vpright sitte. For that is a poynt principall—preve it who-so will— To be dred for thy domes and dowted for thy myght; For ther is neither lered ne lewed þat lyveth vpon erthe That wyssheth after worship; his wit is full fable But yif he wite be his werkes he hath well deserued, And of his well doyng his dedes to deme the same. “The loue of thi liegmen, that to thi lawe are bounde, Take hit for a tresour of hem that are true, That may the more availl in a myle-wey Thanne moche of thy mukke þat manhode loueþ neuere. The playnt of the pouere peple put þou not behynde, For the swope and swete and swynke for thy fode; Moche worship they wynne the in this worlde riche, Of thy gliteryng gold and of thy gay wedes, Thy proude pelure, and palle with preciouse stones, Grete castels and stronge, and styff walled townes. And yit the most preciouse plente þat apparaill passeth, Thi pouere peple with here ploughe pike oute of the erthe, And they yeve here goddes to gouerne hem euen, And yit the peple ben well apaid to plese þe allone. Suche loue is on the leid of lordes and of lower, And grete is thi grace that god hath the lent. “Thi peres in parlement pull hem to-geders, Worche after wysdom, &amp; worshipe will folowe; For as a lord is a lord and ledeth the peple, So shuld prowesse in þi persone passe oþer mennes wittes: The wittyest and wylyest and worthiest in armes. All is but waste wele and he wronge vse, And vnsemely for a souerain (so saue me our lord) And hevy for his name that hyndred will ever. “Sir, þou most be worldly wys, &amp; ware þe betymes; And kepe the fro glosyng of gylers mowthes, That speken to the spiritually with spiritual tonges, Momelyn with here mouthes moche and malys in hert, And of a mys menyng maketh a faire tale, Vnder flateryng and fair speche falsehede foloweth; And yif they myght with her moustres to mame þe for euere, With disceit of here derknesse þe deuell hem a-drenche! “Be kende to thi clergi and comfort þe pouere; Cherissh thy champyons and chief men of armes; And suche as presoners mowe pike with poyntes of werre, Lete hem wilde that they wynne, &amp; worþyly hem þonke; And suche as castels mowe cacche, or eny clos tounes, Geve hem as gladly—than shalt þou gete hertes. For god in his gospell asketh nothyng elles, But oonly loue for love; and let hym be levest. Also he that is stronge strokes for to dele, Make hym thy marchall, and maner his maistre; That for his doughtynesse men mowe hym drede, And for his wysdom and witte the better to be ware. Knyghtes of thy counseill, connyng in armes, That been seker at asay, and sober to thy frendes, Suche thou shuldest comfort be cours of thy kende, That lede here lyves in labour for thy loue. Loke þou haue suche a man that loueth not to lye, A faithfull philosofre þat flater woll never; For he that fareth as a faane folowyng þy wille, Worche þou well or woo, he woll þe not amende. Lere lettrewre in þy youthe, as a lord befalleth, Whan þou to parlement shall passe þere lordes shull pere; For to her of thy wysdom þey woll awayte after, And though her speche be but small, þe more be here þoughtes; For yif þou haue no science to shewe of thyself, But as a brogour to go borowe pore mennes wittes, That were most myscheef þat myght a lord befalle, Ther as wyse men haue wrapped her wittes togidre. “Sir, they it come to þe of kynde a kyng to be called, Yit must þou knowe of corage what knyghthood befalleþ; For he þat armes shall haunte, in youþe he must begynne. Of all artes vnder heven, vse is a maistre. “Sir, more-ouere be not gredy gyftes to grype; Rather þou shalt yeve hem þat fele agreved, So shall thy hawtesse highlich be honoured, And prudence in thy principaltee y-preised for euere. For in ensample y shall you shewe that soth is knowe: A kyng shuld not of curtesie couetouse be holde, For there-as couetyse is knowe in a kynges brest Ther is corage out of kende when mukke is his maistre. The condicion of a kyng shuld comfort his peple. For such laykes ben to love þere leedes laghen alle. “My liege lord, of this mater y meve you no more, But euere in your mynde haue hym þat you made, And taketh a siker ensample þat crist hym-self sheweth, Of all the seyntes in heven that for hym deth suffred, For his loue thei were so large heir lyves they lost, And for loue of that Lord aloft now they dwelle With that crowned kyng that on cros dyed; Ther Crist in his kyngdom comfort vs euere, And of his high grace graunte vnto vs alle Prosperite, and pees pursue we therafter.” Explicit. 96.

Be thow hys consaylle and hys souereigne rede, So as he wexeth with vertu him t'avaunce; And, blessed lord, be thow bothe helpe and spede To alle that labouren for hys enheritaunce, Bothe in this realme and in the grounde of ffraunce; And ay preserve vnder thy myghty honde Him and hys moder, thy peple, and thy londe. In short tyme that thow may atteyne, Withoute lettyng or any perturbaunce, To be corowned with worthy corovnes tweyne, ffrist in this londe and afterwarde in ffraunce. And yive hym grace to lyve to thy plesaunce, And ay preserve vnder thy myghty honde Hym and hys moder, thy peple, and thy londe. Explicit. 99. THAT PEACE MAY STAND Advocates MS. 19.3.1 Iesu, þat was borne of mare fre, As he hase pwower and mey best Save all in gud prosperite, þat feyne wolde sette þis reme in rest; And send whom luf and charite þat feyth were wonus among hus fast. for, by my troþe, hit is pete To wytte þo pepul so sore dystrest, As þei have byn be est and west— Robbud and slene thoro-owt þis londe. All-my?the Iesu, os he mey best, lene hus grace nowe þat pese mey stond. For I haue mych mervel of mony men þat of more myscheu wold be full feyne, And syche as kan no resvn ken, þat wold þer schulde be trobul ageyne; And hase hade knoleg whare and when how mony a gud mon has ben slene. me thynke þat konsyons schuld hom ken to pray for pes with all þer mene. þat lord þat for hus soffurd pene And markud adam apon þo sond, Send luf and charete home a-geyne, And lene hus grace þat pes mey stond. And he þat more vnpes wolde haue With-in þis reme be dey or ny?the, I pray to god he be not save, But on hym-selue þat hyt mey ly?the. for þer ar mony a lydur knave þat in þo fylde wolde feyntly fy?th, But trwe mens gud ?yt wolde þei have to Robbe and reve þem of þer rygth. Iesus, os he is most of my?th, send luf and charite in-to þis londe, þat consyons moth kepe his kandul ly?th, And lene hus grace now þat pes mey stonde. Be mony insampuls men mey see þat we plese not al owre god to pey; for hare-be-fore in yerus iij mych of owre welth hase wastud awey, with grete darthe and poverte, And vnkynde wedurs be ny?th and dey, Waturs stronke and flodus hee Whyche dystryde boþe borne and hey; And a-monke howr-selfe byn mony a-frey, be norþe and sowþe thoro-owte þis londe. Al-my?hty Iesu, os he best mey, lene hus grace nowe þat pes mo?t stonde. Hyt wer grete nede to prey for pes, And fro all sich folys hus defende; for, loke, sython warus be-gan to ses! how feire insampuls god has hus sende: þo sesonabulst wedur, withowtvn leyse, þat euer mon sawe dryvvn tyl a nende, And fevr on gronde kon kornus incres, And lyke þoro grace þat þo worde schuld mende. Wer luf and charite with hus blend, þat concions my?th reyne with-in þis londe, þen schulde owre trobul be at a nende, And I trust to god þat pes schulde stonde. To pray for luf and charite hit was neuer so mycul nede; for we haue lost in yerus iij mony du?th mon of dede. yette wolde we all trvwe men be And holde to-gedur when we hade nede; with þo grace of god and owre lade hus thurt no nodur nacions drede. We ar yette enoo, so god me spede, to defende owre enmys owt of þis londe. þat lorde þat on a rode kon blede lene hus grace now þat pes mey stonde. Wolde we be trwe in fylde and towne And all men holde a-pon a syde, With þo ryght of ynglonde and þo cron, And lett no falsdam be owre gyde; yf þat owr enmys wolde be boyn Ayenus hus for to go or ryde, And we wolde fare with no treson, we schulde be abull to fel þer pride. þat lorde þat sofurd wondus wyde Sende luf and charite in-to þis londe, þat concyons my?th among vs byde And lene hus grace now þat pes mey stonde. And mare mylde, þat neuer hade make, Prey to þi son boþe dey and ny?th, lene hom grace seche consel take þat mey be plesand to god almy?th, And all falsdam to for-sake, And euery mon holde with troþe and ryght; And þen schulde welthe and worchyp wake, And ful grete grace among hus ly?th. Iesu, as he ys most of my?th, lene hus grace now þat pes my?the stonde, And bryng hus all to þat bygyng bry?th þer Ioy and blys ys euer-lastonde. Explicit, quod heege. Amen. amen. 100.
