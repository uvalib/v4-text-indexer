      <field name="fulltext">INSCRIBED TO THE MEMORY OF HENRY KIRKE WHITE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNET This Poem was inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for May 1820. ON FIRST READING THE REMAINS OF HENRY KIRKE WHITE, 9th April, 1819. And didst thou from obscurity arise, Resplendent through the gloom of Fate, and sweep Thy lyre, — wont so melodiously to weep In solitude — and hail those brighter skies, Which harsher destiny to me denies? Thy spirit cheers me up the tuneful steep, And wakes me from Dejection's iron sleep, With sweeter than Castalian harmonies! Oh! why didst thou not visit me before, And lead me to thy favourite alder tree, See Henry's Ode “To my Lyre,” stanzas V. and VI. Where still the wild gales through thy harp-strings pour A dirge of more than mortal minstrelsy? There, while young Genius it inspires to soar, One lone unmeasured note might utter hope to me! THE LEGEND of ST. Loy The Story of St. Loy. Extracted from the Poem of “Tottenham.” “High praise to Loy is due, and well on earth he wrought. “Long slept he in Obscurity's dim vale, “Till Clothaire found his worth and bade him shine, “And then the air of Courts he did inhale, “And minister devoutly at the shrine, “That he, no less than Heaven, had made divine; “And now his soul is sainted where he reigns, “Worshipped by earth — and I, O Loy, am thine!— “And much from thee the Ham of Totten gains, “Thine Altar and thy Well the glory of her plains!” Introduction. “The Muse, nae Poet ever fand her, “'Till by himsel he learned to wander, “Adown some trotting burn's meander, “An' no think lang. “O sweet, to stray, and pensive ponder “A heart-felt sang.” Burns. Away! ye Cares of th' ever-toiling World, Toiling for gain, and reaping but dismay; Still on the rack of Disappointment hurled, Alike the wise, the busy, and the gay, In the pursuit of that prismatic ray Of luring Hope, that, as they follow, flies, Each,—all,—enjoying ne'er the present day, Still doating on the morrow, as it dies, Until no morrow comes, to cheer their stony eyes! Away, ye Cares!—and let me calm survey The blushes of the western skies, that tell The steps of the departure of the day; And bid the broad pavilioned Sun farewell; And muse, along the sweet sequestered dell, On every charm of Nature, as I stray; And wish for some lone, melancholy cell, All silent, save the birds, and dashing spray, There would I tune my harp, and meditate the lay! My Soul delights in every sylvan spot, Where she may find the Beauteous and the Grand, And trace the semblance of her inmost thought On every work of her Creator's hand! But not to me 'tis given to command My flight o'er wave, rock, mountain, wood, and wild, Nor e'en in rurals of my father land To learn the things dear to poetic child; In Thracian coil for aye, and City strife turmoiled! Nor frequent to these shades may I retire: Nor here is Nature throned in native charms To wake the notes from the consenting lyre— The fields partake Trade's dissonant alarms! This not her Temple, redolent of balms, And made of music! perfect and supreme, Whose solemn grandeur every passion calms That pines for base desires:—and speaks of Him, Who framed the finished whole, Nature's immortal Theme! No! this is not the Centre of her Dome, Where soars her incense from the sacred shrine, Whence Bards convey the genuine rapture home, Their fragrance steal, their minstrelsy design— Oh, that their blessings were, my soul! but thine— Yet, 'tis the Portal to her ample Fane, And, at the threshold, thou may'st well divine, As thou dost down the aisles thy vision strain, From the long levelled beams, the Glories of her reign! But 'twas not always so.—In days of yore, Ere lawless Trade his landmark did remove, And on the pastures won still more and more, These plains the Goddess ruled with fertile love! Deer wantoned in the wood, the hawk above, “—but we know it did of old belong to the Court, and was a place where the King's hawks were kept, and the master falconer had both a manor and abode, so that it was the properest place to entertain foreigners at, and for princes to take pleasure in, since there was abundance of game in the woods and forests about it, both for hawking and hunting, which occasioned the princes and nobles of Scotland (to whom the whole parish once belonged) to be pleased with their sojourning here.” The Right Hon. Henry Lord Viscount Coleraine, and F.S.A. his “History and Antiquities of the Town and Church of Tottenham, in the County of Middlesex, 1795.” And Fays in every field, by moonlight, made Their ringlets quaint, and haunted spring and grove, The Fauns and Sylvans danced in ev'ry shade, The Zephyrs waved their wings, and hill and lawn surveyed. The Seat of Happiness! if mortal life Certain were not to teem with mortal woe; Where is the place without convulsive strife That will, at least, dash every joy below? Of those old dusky times my numbers flow, When he, Edward the Martyr. the young and royal Martyr, fell! Ere on his lips her offered wine could glow, Her coward stroke behind did Treachery deal!— Woman! thy tender breast can thus Ambition steel? Not that my theme.—O, ye who love to feel! To follow vagrant Fancy's wayward flight, And yield the soul, in sympathetic zeal, To sorrows not your own, with sweet delight, While stillness murmurs through the pensive night:— List to the Minstrel, and his Tale of Woe: Scorn not the verse, although a youth invite; So may the wild Song thro' your bosom glow, And thrill the tender thought with Grief's delicious throe! CANTO THE FIRST. The Hermitage. “Nos duo turba sumus”— Ovid. Met. i. 355. The deer that is stricken will ache with the wound, Though it fly from the hunter, and 'scape from the hound: And the heart that is scathed will remain so for ever, Though it won in the waste where the world may come never; And sighs will consume it, in youth or in age, In coil or in silence, in stillness or motion, On the waves of the world, or the waves of the ocean, In the populous town, or the lone hermitage. I. “Daughter of Heaven! whose steps of light “Stately adorn the vault of night, “Why dost thou now desert the skies, “With thy companions? wake! arise! “Reveal the silence of thy face, “Pleasant in loveliness and grace— “And with thy tide of beauty bathe “The clouds rejoicing in thy path. “Oh, doth some Wizard's impious spell “Constrain thee to thy Ocean-cell? “Or the weird sister's blasting rite “Blank thy chaste, cold, and paly light? “And shut up every stellar spark? “Thine azure path in Heaven is dark! “In darkness roll the troubled waves, “While the northern loudly raves, “Howling through the dismal wood, “And chokes with trees the swelling flood— “Arise! ye winds of winter, rise! “O tempest ye, again, the skies! “Blow ye blasts along the heath! “Echo, ye hills, the sounds of death! “Heaven, rive again the solid oak, “With the repeated thunder-stroke! “Remind me of the flashing deep, “Where all my joys for ever sleep!” II. Between each blast the plaints preferred, Of Edwy young, but sad, were heard By Almar, of the tresses grey:— The Hermit, old and sage, Beheld him, by his taper's ray, Before the Hermitage. “The third remarkable thing of this second ternary is the Hermitag, distant Southward from the Crosse about x score, or short of a stone bridge in the bottome vii or viii score: it was, within memory of some yet liuing, a little square building, for the most part of bricke; it is now a pretty dwelling for a small family.” Wilhelm Bedwell's “Brief Description of the Town of Tottenham High Crosse, in Middlesex; together with an Historical Narration of such memorable Things as are there to be seen and observed, 1631” No other light was thereabout,— All else was gloom,—within, without— And that was tremulous and dim, Like a wan star's reflected gleam Obliquely glancing in the stream, As, rippling e'er along, It gently glides, and softly swells, To lave the Naiad's coral cells. But, by that quivering dubious flame, He watched that younger Hermit's frame, As started he in frantic trance, And shot a wild and fearful glance, Rejoicing in the tempest's yell; And marked his kindled spirit swell, Extatical and strong— Gently the Youth's raised hand he took, And pierced him with a pitying look, Tempered with age's gravity, And waked him from his vision high. Confused, he drooped his head awhile, But raised it soon again, Saw Almar's fond and pensive smile, Felt his paternal strain. III. “Hermit, of yellow locks of youth! “Hath not this cell the power to sooth “The passions of the world? “Where roved thy thoughts? Oh, on the blast “Was thy wild soul at random cast? “And on the tempest hurled? “Son of fond Fancy, Child of Song, “No Bard, with soul of fire, “Burns with more raptures, or more strong, “Though prophet of the lyre. “Nor grey thy head, nor thick thy beard; “But yet, from what I've seen and heard, “Since thou hast here my brother been “In this deep loneliness, I ween, “That thou hast grown old in youth, and Heaven “Hath such experience to thee given “Of sorrows, as may well compare “With Eld's accumulated share. IV. “Oh, I have proved Affliction's cup, “E'en to the lees, and drank it up; “And, though 'twas bitter to the soul “As the old Prophet's mystic scroll, “Yet hath it wrought with power so blest, “That it hath softened all my breast “To sympathies, unknown before, “Sweetly delicious, having more “Of genuine joy, than to the son “Of dissipation can be known. “My son — this breast for woe can feel, “It would not spurn, but strive to heal, “The agonies of madding thought, “With many sorrows overfraught. “When first, before my cell I saw “Thee stand, with looks of filial awe, “Blooming in pensive modesty, “The tear just starting from thine eye, “Imploring me to shroud, with age, “Thy youth within this Hermitage, “From the dull throng of toil and sway, “Miscalled the grave, the blest, the gay, “A voice within then spake for thee, “With more than casual sympathy, “And whispered thou more kindred wert “Than a mere stranger to my heart!” V. O, 'twas the moment of alarms, When all the soul was up in arms, And ready to reveal What, at all other times, it wou'd In sorrow's avaricious mood, Eternally conceal. “ Edwy speaks.'Tis well! ye blasts, roll on, rage, blow! “Deride me with remembered woe, “Ye authors of my misery— “My Brother! thou wert all to me! “Then, since thou 'rt lost, let pristine gloom, “And Chaos old, their sway resume! “'Tis sweet, to think in Winter-nights “Upon returning May — “'Tis sad! to muse o'er past delights, “For ever past away! “Yet still my thoughts will ponder on “The joys that are for ever gone. VI. “Alike Heaven framed our kindred minds, “With souls of fire, and free as winds, “Which shot into our kindled eyes, “To trace the hues of morning skies; “And the fair eve's ethereal brede, “O'er the broad sun's pavilion spread: “We loved in groves, and glimmering shades, “By echoing rocks, and prone cascades, “With thrilling hearts, to ponder o'er “The bardish tales of times no more. “Oh, thence were we enflamed to roam “Far from our own, our narrow home. “Cambria! thy mountains we have seen, “Explored each cavern, forest, glen; “Heard from thy bards, of Arthur's days, “In many a grove, the wonderous lays. “Harp of the North! thy magic strain “Our eagle spirits roused again. “We roamed the Celtic mountains brown, “The isles of streamy Caledon. “On Ocean blue we raised our sails, “To Lochlin waft by favoring gales, “That flattered to betray! “There we arrived—but, O, no more “Regained the opposite fair shore, “Across the whirling way. Referring to Pentland Frith, and the Wells of Swinna, which divide Scotland from the Orkney Isles, anciently called Lochlin, as part of Scandinia. The navigation alluded to is very dangerous, on account of the many vortexes occasioned by the repulse of the tides from the shore, and their passage between the Orkney Islands.” “The blasts heaved up the mighty tides, “Which burst upon the vessel's sides! “Down the dark whirlpool of the deep, “Horror! descends the reeling ship; “And all her freighted souls, for aye — “With them my Brother past away, “Mid flashing foam, and blasting leven, “And thunder pealing through the heaven! “O why, ye surges! did ye spare “My life to anguish more severe? “And cast me on the rugged rock, “That sternly did the billows mock? “The moon-beam trembled on the wave “Which washed my Brother's oozy grave! VII. “Wish of my soul! Land of my birth!— “'Twas desolate to me! “My Parents God had ta'en from earth, “They cheered me not for thee! His Brother. “What should I do? I was alone! “Friendless! a wretch but made to moan! “The World's at best but bitterness, “But double wormwood to distress! “Oh, could the spirit wont to soar, “Above the stir of this dim spot, “Stoop to the crowd? or thence procure “That peace she in herself had not? “No; but she bent her to the plains, “Scenes of my boyhood's joys and pains, “In pious calm to smooth her way “To regions of celestial day. “I came — heard of thy holy life, “Remote from vanity and strife; “I thought our moods would well agree — “Thou hast a father been to me. “Though sometimes will my plainings rise, “And interrupt our quiet joys, “But thine 's a breast, to feeling dear, “That loves to dry the gushing tear.” VIII. Like one, the Hermit old appears, Defeated in his quest: Then shook his hoar head, and, with tears, Strained Edwy to his breast: At length, with hurried voice exclaimed; “Of other sequel I had dreamed— “Yet,—by the voice of sympathy, “That whispers still within for thee; “Yet, surely thou more kindred art, “Than a mere stranger to my heart.” IX. Now hath he knelt in piety Before the simple Shrine; And on the Cross hath fixed his eye, To lift his thoughts to God on high, Whose precious blood divine Upon that wood was poured and spilt, To cleanse mankind from leperous guilt, And rescue them from Death: Now, kneels that younger Hermit there; His spirit thrills with grateful fear, And soars to Heaven with every prayer Upon the wings of Faith. That Cross stood on a human Scull;— Emblem of Earth and Heaven! It was a moral, never dull, As in a vision given— Behold, fond Man! the mystic sign— Be tutor'd from that simple Shrine, How frail, how vain, thy hopes below! The sage, the gay, the high, the low, Must from their wealth, their bliss, their woe, Their birth, their beauty, part.— The foeman's hate will 'vail no more, And those, who honored thee before, Who treasured thee in their heart's core, Thine altered form will not endure, But thence with horror start. X. That moral Scull now read no more; But turn thee to that hallow'd Cross;— Thus taught no longer to adore Earth's perishable dross— Now, on the ruins of the world, And thrones in desolation hurled, Learn to exalt that sign of Faith, Triumphant over Hell and Death. Oh, certain of the stroke of fate, Why shouldst thou, in this mortal state, Engender everlasting hate, In vain, against thy fellow frail? It cannot reach him in the dust, And thine immortal rancour must Put on mortality, and fail; But serving now this life to gloom, And but Death's mockery in the tomb! Why shouldst thou wrestle for, and doat On, the empty vanities afloat Down the wild ocean of this life, With idle Folly's envious strife? Who would not then his wrath resign, His fierce revenge, his noble line, Pride—pageantry—and tinsel shine,— Exchange them for this simple Shrine, Whose soul was sane and sage? Devote to God, in conscious peace, Retire from time's tempestuous seas, Of chance and change, to calm and ease.— And end the quest of Happiness, In this lone Hermitage? XI. Their musings have kept them too long from their sleep:— The clock strikes twelve!—disjointed and deep, On the wild cadence of the blast, The echoing sounds came erring and fast, But still they kneel in prayer— Devotion's flame hath kindled high, And from the earth their spirits fly, Entranced above the upper sky; While, from his starry sphere, Sailed many an Angel to that Grove, Upon the golden wings of love, To bear their words to Him above, And truly register In God's own book, their righteous way, To be produced at that great Day, When christ shall come with radiant sway, Omnipotence and fear, And bid them to their seats divine— Lo, all around that simple shrine, Doth their celestial tendance shine, And stand in secret there: Their wings throughout that Cell are bright; They fill it with unearthly light, And chase the darkness drear. XII. Hark! the sound of rude tumult now thickens in air, With Woman's sad wail and the shriek of Despair! Wild Triumph and Anguish together were there! The wolwish noise silenced the blast of the night, With blasphemy horrid, and fiercer affright: E'en like the concussion of maritime fight, That stills the vast tempest which raged just before, To dead calm the motionless billows all o'er.— Those Angel wings no more are bright Throughout that Cell:—they take their flight Up to the realms of peace and light. Those sounds of violence rose with yell As horrible as that of hell, Which might not bend an Angel's ear, Unmeet for purity to hear. Heaven from such blasphemy with horror shrinketh, Sparing not Him on whom unawed no Spirit thinketh. XIII. But oft, each awful pause between, Far other sounds do intervene, That must the soul subtlue and melt Which ever hath compassion felt; Seemed as they then stood still and mute, And Pity's self to that mad rout Her soul-assuasive voice applied; While suddenly the tumult died, As charmed, or thrilled, or awed by her, With love, or ruth — remorse, or fear. But soon again the clamours rise, And, if again the tumult dies, Those plaining sounds are heard no more That charmed, and thrilled, and awed before: Yea, bade in gentler bosoms swell Anguish most inexpressible — Such feelings as Compassion knows When woman claims protection from her foes! But now the Toteham Tottenham, in Doomsday Book, is called Toteham. echoes all around, The hubbub and confusion wild resound, Where pause was not, with ruth confounded there, In sounds of violence advancing near: Thus from a wreck, with intermitting roar, While leaves the Fiend of Storms his blasts to pour, The shrieks arise toward the startled shore. Anon the Demon of the North Pours his voice of thunders forth: But when again it may a moment sleep, Not a shriek coileth the billowy deep. Those piercing shrieks the foaming wave Hath buried in many an oozy cave; Then, as in triumph for the ruin past, Mounts up again, and mingles with the blast. XIV. Roused by the clamour and the yell, Sprang Edwy now before the cell. What sees he there, that thus he stands With haggard eyes, and lifted hands? “O, holy Virgin! —Almar, speed! “Man's made to mourn! his heart to bleed! “Behold, the Heavens are all on fire! “The night, with conflagration dire, “Though erst so dark and dreary, now “In blood-red hue doth burn and glow. “See Toteham's vast, high, foggy wood, “Discovered by the broad, bright flood. “On her own Western brow, in light, “Shines All Saint's Gothic, towery height. “The Parish Church of Tottenham is dedicated to All Saints.” William Robinson's “History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham High Cross, 1818.” “The time of its erection, the cause of its dedication to All Saints, or Sanctis Dominis, to God and his holy Dons, or Doms, as the old English sacramental obligation used to spell it, I cannot yet account for.” Lord Viscount Coleraine (as before). Surely, then, a Poet has license to suppose it in existence at any time, if to his own advantage. “Where join the clouds with the misty hill, “There the deep blood-red mingles still — “A blazing canopy, around “With fiery horizon bound! “O Christ! that desolate spot behold! “Where the flames in volumes are upward roll'd, “Whence, o'er the land, this lustre dread “Flashes around, and overhead. “The bickering sparks are cast on high, “In awful grandeur, to the sky! “The blasts of night assist the fire, “And aggravate its furious ire! “Oh, now, methinks, I hear the cry, “The shrieks of female agony, “As th' inmates wild from room to room “Flee in vain from their wretched doom.— “And the flame gushes out wherever they enter, “And a thick cloud of smoke coils them up in its centre; “They rush forth in their torment — look!—Heavens!—they cling “To the window-cill, whence they hoped to fling “Themselves, in mere despair, that seeks “Refuge in death it strives to shun, “When terror but within us speaks, “And peril leaves a choice to none: “Their hold yet fearing to forego, “And drop into the void below! “But some have fallen exhausted there, “And left their lives in middle air; “Or in the smouldering flames beneath “Find torture, and a lingering death! “The scene is present to mine eyes — “Blended with this approaching noise, “It wakes strange thoughts of doubt and fear, “'Lothbroch wrought that consuming glare! “Lo! light of torches hither flare; “Those sounds swell more distinct and near!” —“And nearer yet, the horrid yell! “Jesu Maria, shield us well!” XV. Scarce to the emotions of his mind Had Edwy given relief, And Almar old had scarce rejoin'd Th' ejaculation brief, Ere came the Band, with joyous rage, And covered all the space Which spread before the Hermitage With torches glaring rays, That shed a short and cowering light Mingled along the mist of night, And shewed each griesly feature clear; The lank red beard, the shaggy hair, The rugged brows that rigid lour O'er eyes of unrelenting power, That seemed as never yet a tear Had claimed its proper channel there, But spake their souls of sternest steel, And hearts severe that scorned to feel! Their numerous feet tread down the grass, And brush away the dew; Their shouts disturb that grove, alas! Which nought but peace ere knew. Not with more noise the echoing cave —When from on high the tumbling wave Dashes down cataracts headlong steep, In thunder, on the misty deep, Before its mouth — resounds the roar From many an answering fracture hoar; While all its trees the storm-blast meet, That doth their trembling branches greet Full roughly, and their wakened voice Blend with the complicated noise! XVI. Like that same hill, of streams that frown Above the waves on high, Which throws his thundering tempests down To ocean from the sky; Thus towered Lothbroch's giant-form, Superior to his ruffian band, Who sways to swell or still their storm With high and haughty hand, More stern, more rigid, more severe, His gesture fierce, and gloomy air; But in his sovereign voice and mien, And piercing eye, was heard and seen The expression of a loftier mind, For other purposes designed, Abused to deeds of infamy, That, well employed, had given A name of immortality, Which might have bloomed in Heaven. Yet who his lofty mien could pass Without repeated look? Although that something in his face No common eye might brook — That something which appals and awes, And yet again the chill eye draws, Unsatisfied, yet dreading too, At full to meet his fearful view! 'Twas that the greatness of his soul, Perverted from her first intent, Yet still retained her high control, And to his frowns and glances lent Her native energy divine; Like Demon, bent on fell design, Applies his pristine Angel-force, To aid the horrors of his course. XVII. But, lo! 'mid that outrageous strife, Pale, without any form of life; With tresses loose, disordered charms, Droops a fair Lady in his arms: Closed her fixed eyes in stony sleep, Whose frozen currents might not weep — In Nature's pulse an awful pause, A still suspension of her laws! But neath those features, coldly sealed, What anguished thoughts, though not revealed, May agonize her soul unseen, With pangs the deeper felt within! O'erpowered by feeling's wild excess, She hangs all pale and motionless,— Lovely; but that her chill despair, And torches ever-wavering glare, Had marred her charms, so sweetly fair? But ah! to what shall I compare, In her distress that Lady fair? Like to a flower, by whirlwinds torn From her glad soil, and wildly borne, On a bleak rock exposed and bare, To droop, and pine, and wither there. And all unfeeling as that rock, Seemed he her miseries to mock: And as its height, by morning sky Purpled with many a radiant die, Or clad in day's effulgent power, Appears to triumph o'er that flower; So his stern pride t' exult above, That faded form of grace and love. XVIII. “By Woden wild! well have we sped! “And every oath to boot!”—he said;— “How glorious rose the blaze on high, “Kindling th' undulating sky! “And with what frantic fury, did “Her doating Lord, the flames amid, “Encounter me! yet, with one breath, “I chained his powers as still as death; “But when I had secured his wife, “Gave him again his reckless life, “And dared him to all future strife— “Poor soul! her ashy lips and cheek, “The horrors of the night bespeak, “And Fear's chill hand hath lain such hold, “That e'en her heart is still and cold. “But ere long shall her azure eyes “Rival the bright and morning skies; “Perhaps, shall languish in their tears, “While flow diffus'd her golden hairs, “And to her native loveliness, “Be added that of sweet distress. “Her form will swell upon my sight, “Renewed in undulating light; “And, rich with dew, her blue eyes roll, “The liquid lustres of the soul! “While Beauty sits sublime and high, “Upon a throne of ivory; “And words as music sweet, yet strong, “Upbraid my crimes, and causeless wrong;— “These hands, as lillies white, and soft, “Sore-wrung, and madly clasp'd aloft, “Sorrow to feign, on Heaven to call, “Where laugh the Gods to see her fall— “'Till done enough to humour pride, “And make false shew of hate beside, “After her hour, she yields her heart, “And wonders at her former part.” XIX. That scene the Hermits saw and heard, And in their hearts emotions stirred; Emotions, such as take their rise From the most strong affinities — Then, Edwy had rushed into strife, And for her rescue given his life, But other care, his purpose bold Warped, towards Almar weak and old.— As on that Lady's wakening soul, Seemed life's returning stream to roll, She started like in phrensied dream, And uttered forth a feeble scream, Then rapid rolled her glazing eyes, All haggard-wild, around, and spies That rout, she recollected well — “My husband!”—she exclaimed, and fell— 'Twas but a moment;—and more deep, Returned that fixed and iron sleep. XX. There Edwy turned to Almar old, Admonished by his ear; His altered gesture did behold, His trembling frame uprear— “It was her voice!”—that sad presage O'ercame the feeble powers of age— “It was her voice!—and seemed, as then, “It waked an answering voice within! “And then I dreamed I saw her here, “As once she was, all charming fair “In sorrow, loving me the best, “Then, when I spurned her from my breast!” —Sustained in wondering Edwy's arms, He kenned her marred disordered charms— “It is not she! the features there, “Are not like her's, as once they were.— “But yet, 'twas wonderous toned like her's; “And in the peopled universe “There was no voice I fondly deemed “Like her's: and, in my dotage dreamed “In that deceived I could not be— “But now I'm a thing of frailty! “A poor, infirm, old man! whose woe “Cheats him with fancy's airy show— “Ideal shadows, sounds, and things, “Of overwrought imaginings!”— Faint with the burstings of his grief, The strong convulsions of the soul, That, like an earthquake, shook, tho' brief, The frame of age, and jarred the whole, Voiceless, in Edwy's arms he fell, E'en as that Lady, insensible. XXI. Meanwhile, that Son of Violence, And Arts forbid to Innocence, Dread, secret, dark—which but to name Would shake this universal frame, Pluck down the star-attended moon, And cloud the sun, in lofty noon: The pillared arch of Heaven torn; And Earth, with all her mountains, borne From her firm base of Order, spoken, When first Confusion's rule was broken:— Arts, whose wild orgies Nature wound, Leagued with the storms that rage around: Meanwhile, triumphant, still, his scorn, That bandit-Chief had not forborne Over that victim of his power. That winter-touch'd, cold-faded flower: The daughter of distress supreme, And o'erwrought agony extreme. Yet, happy she, her wretchedness Had wrought to such extreme excess, Her spirit sunk, collapsed and chill; From too much feeling could not feel! Nor her ear hear the taunts he made, As thus the pride of Evil said:— XXII. “How her eye opened! yet, soon dark, “Beneath those fringes, every spark.— “But with far other glances she “Shall open soon its Heaven on me— “For those fierce gleams of haggard ire, “Oeiliads of love, and soft desire— “'Tis thus we win the joys of love, “Which ne'er yon Anchorites can prove; “Self-reft of all delights they dwell “Within that solitary Cell; “Fools of reclusion fond and dull, “Of worldly disappointments full — “Cowards! why not revenge their loss, “Upon the injurious World like us?— “Even now, within their Hermitage “They tremble at our threatened rage, “Loathing our name, and full of fears, “Though our cause be the same as their's— “Cowards! whose place the World was joy'd, “To find for nobler Spirits void. “From Us she parted with regret, “And would rejoice again to get; “But we had the contempt to spurn, “The wisdom never to return, “The courage to revenge, or die— “Which last they lack from Piety— “Hey! Piety?—a goodly veil “To hide the fears it would conceal. “But we can shew as much as they, “In a more bold and manly way— “Now, by the thousand arms of Death! “Give to the song of Triumph breath— “Ye horrors of the foggy wood! “Avengers of a Brother's blood! “Of a Son's wrongs! a Father's fate! “Sent post to Hell by kindred hate— “Startle these hermits;—loud and brief,— “For joyous is your faithful Chief!” XXIII. Regardless of that Lady's woes, The wild and reckless tumult rose; And on the blasts of night that roared, The unruly song they loudly poured— Song of the Robbers. 1 Throughout the World, one robs another; Each hath his separate Villainy: Friend beggars friend; and brother, brother!— Then, tell us, what are we? 2 When the wild night is black with storms, And lightnings blast the Traveller lone; We are the fearful spectral forms, That make their horrors all our own. 3 The Spirits of Heaven's vengeance we! That awe him to confess his guilt, And do its work of equity! He dies!—a Sinner's blood is spilt! XXIV. What! is the song of triumph mute? And where is that tumultuous rout? O, ye to your dismal woods have gone, Whose echoes shall answer that Lady's moan! A dead calm rests upon that Grove, And Silence whispers around and above: The Hermitage, freed from that maddening rout, Is peaceful within, and peaceful without.— Within?—but more closely that scene let us scan;— Then judge ye of the state of man! XXV. Thou hast return'd, O Almar old, To life from that deep slumber cold! Thy soul, winged unto former years, —With pleasure marked, and many sears, That make the bliss e'en woe, — away Returns to her abode of clay. Ah! how unlike that Lady's state, Conveyed, by too severe a fate, Stiffened, and cold, and senseless still, Upon that Robber's arm; Subjected to his brutal will, Bereft of every charm! And 'tis of her their thoughts awake, And this the form their musings take. XXVI. As starting from his phrensied dream To Reason's dim-returning gleam, Almar, on Edwy's breast sustained, Wondered the calm that silent reigned. “How still! how awful!”—trembling he:— “Like silence dead of sepulchre, “After the bustle of this stage “Of earth, of care, of mortal rage! “Or, like that silence, deep and dread, “When Michael's trump hath waked the dead, “Which shall succeed its summons high, “And wait the judgments of the sky! “But soft — and dream I not? — and have “They borne thee to their horrid cave? “Oh, how will thine unwonted sight “Behold the hideous deeds of Night? “Behold the rites of Hell, abhorred? “And Demons rising to his word? “The spell-appalling change of wile “Thy heart from Virtue to beguile? “Oh, they will blast thy tender eye, “Beneath its lid to pale and die!— “How shall thine ears sustain the yell, “The orgies of his fiendish cell? “Oh, they will sink beneath the wound, “And never more admit a sound: “No more, within the evening vale, “List to the lovelorn nightingale! “But thou wilt petrify for aye “In his chill power, and pass away: “Then find, in cold Obstruction's gloom, “The end of all thy sorrows come! “Hell on thy soul, thou man of ill, “Infernal giant, wild of will, “Impress its fangs in its dark den! “While she in endless bliss shall reign! “Thou, Lady fair of wretchedness, “God pity thee in thy distress! “I love thee for thy voice alone, “So like my Arabella's tone! “What father had not felt as wild “As I, so long from his dear child, “Parted so long?—so very long, “Estranged by mine, and not thy wrong!— “Why, when a father's heart of love, “Like cypress, weeps the tomb above “Where lies inurned his daughter's heart, “With whom his hopes did all depart; Almar's had not all departed, as the Reader will perceive from his Story in the next Canto. His daughter might still be living. The other was a stronger argument to excuse the shock, which his pride — the principal trait in his character—had sustained. “Oh, think ye that he will not deem “Each gale her voice, in sorrow's dream? “Yes, and will bless the weeping trees, “That rustle with the sighing breeze; “Form from the sounds her voice so dear, “Turn them to words, and answer her; “Bless the sweet spirit that from above “Soothes him with whispers of her love!” XXVII. What judge ye of the state of man? That all are born alike to pain? Or for our own or other's woe, One common doom of grief below? And deem ye thus of sympathy? Hence, ye profane! away from me! Is there no joy in grief then known That weeps for sorrows not our own? Did not those Hermits' bosoms feel A sweet delicious pleasure steal, As o'er the fate of one so fair They mixt with Pity's Virtue's tear? And ye, who love the wondrous tale Where doubt and terror still prevail, And lead you through the mazes wild, By Passion's powerful voice beguiled, 'Till ye, at length, reward distress, Whereof ye wished, yet feared, to guess! Oh, in such rich, indulgent grief, Have ye not found from care relief? A sweetly-melting, trembling sense Of Pleasure's finer influence; A fascinating charm, that weans The spirit from these grosser scenes? Ye youths! ye maids! of tender frame, Who bloom in charms, and melt in flame; His tale the Minstrel tunes for you, Like you, both young, and feeling too, Alive to every touch and tone, And thrilling grace, of Nature's own — Oh, by the spell of Beauty's eye! By Love's delicious witchery! Scorn not his rhyme — so once again He will renew the native strain; 'Till on the harp be fully told The Legend of the Days of Old! END OF CANTO THE FIRST. CANTO THE SECOND. The Well of St. Loy. “Fair Maid, “To you your father should be as a God; “One that composed your beauties; yea, and one “To whom you are but as a form in wax, “By him imprinted; and within his power, “To leave the figure, or disfigure it.” Shakspeare. “And with a father's frown at last, “He sternly disapproved.” Mallet. I. Deem me not superstitious in my creed If I dispute not, but should hold it true, That there are chords within the heart, indeed, Which link our souls together in a clue That distance cannot part, or death undo; Which, with a secret voice of prophecy, Vibrate within us, as some touch they knew Strikes those instinctive keys of sympathy, And finds an echo there, in unison, reply. Thus the fond maid, while absent from her arms Her lover sinks into the watery gloom, Faints with mysterious fears, and strange alarms, That tell her conscious soul his wretched doom: Thus friend for parted friend is overcome, And but too surely prove each other's faith: And thus a father at his daughter's tomb, By earthly means though taught not of her death, Pauses, and trembling feels she's surely laid beneath. Those same chords also feel the impulse strike Which presses on them from external things That are to their beloved objects like, And waken Memory on the thrilling strings — Oh, there is in these fond imaginings A pensive pleasure, only known to Woe, Above the bliss of princes, lords, and kings, Whose hearts by Pride are steeled and blunted so, That they are dead to Love, nor Sympathy can know! II. Sweet Sleep! the balm to toil — the dew That doth our morning strength renew;— Sweet Spirit of Forgetfulness, The unfabled Lethe of Distress;— Blest soother of the Peasant's pillow, Hushed by the night flies to his rest;— Companion, o'er the stormy billow, Of the wet Seaboy on the mast, Cradled on surges, and rocked by the blast To and fro, full giddily;— While Death is awaked by the summons so rude, He heedeth it not, and his slumber's as good, As danger were not nigh; And when, like the Sun, he springs blithe from his bed, Knows nought of the night, nor the feeling of dread:— But oh, thou hast been by rude tempest and rage, Startled from this lone Hermitage. III. The string that throbbed in Almar's breast Was not, nor could it be, represt. Remains that first vibration still, Which awakened with the heart's mysterious thrill, For the hapless doom of that lady fair, Endeared by her misery, and, haply, more dear, And called up the chords of sad Memory, to tell The sorrow for her he had loved so well, But wronged her from that love's excess! Yet who might wish he had loved her less? IV. His anguish to conceal he striveth— 'Tis vain, ah, very vain— Still, still—that fitful string reviveth, Again, and yet again. “Too faithful Memory!”—Almar said— “Whose voice vibrates within; “Nor goes with the past, nor dies with the dead, “To misery e'er akin. “O, fondness — dotage! that mine age, “Tempered in this still Hermitage, “By long experience rendered wise, “And proof 'gainst wonder or surprise, “That from aught new or strange might rise, “Should sink, by Fancy thus o'erthrown, “And find in other's doom, mine own “Conjured by necromantic spell, “From retrospection's airy cell. “List, Edwy, thou my tale shalt know, “Why heave my sighs, my sorrows flow! “To none revealed, not even to thee,— “But thou, it's dwelling place shalt be “I'll pour it in thy genial breast, “To sooth in friendship, and be blest. “After these bursts of heart and soul, “That rent my frame, and scorned control, “Nor could unnoticed pass by thee, “As from thy gesture I may see, “'Tis fit, that by the pride of eld, “It should not be from thee withheld — “List, Edwy, thou my tale shalt know, “Why heave my sighs, my sorrows flow! V. “Good Heaven! Oh, once didst thou not shower “Thy blessings on my sway? “Nor even fate herself might lour “Upon Lord Almar's way. “Noble and honoured, young and gay, “With songs began the light; “Flowery the path of the jocund day, “And blest was the pillow of night; “For thou, the sunbeam of my soul, wert there, “My Arabel, to lighten and to cheer. VI. “But, oh, I was a Child of Pride! “And Nature's harmony “Within my haughty spirit died, “Dull, cold to sympathy. “I scorned the Harp, which pours along “The Bard's deep melody of song, “And deemed its raptures pure and high, “The bursts of phrensied extacy; “And to the music of the Mind, “Was deaf — yea, dead — as one confined “Beneath Trade's harsh and sordid bane, “For ever sedulous of gain. “Ye charms of Nature, Fancy, Love, “Blest with the smile of God above! “Ye warbling woods, ye echoing groves, “Where Flora with Apollo roves, “Beauteous in hue, and sweet with song, “Ravishing the rich air along! “Ye fields, ye mountains, gently-wild, “Awfully-pleasing! rocks up-piled, “That barrier the resounding shore, “Laved by blue ocean's stormy roar! “Ye flowers, ye labyrinths of green, “And all the garniture between! “Ye beauties of the morn and even, “The bright magnificence of heaven! “Thou sun, thou moon, and every star, “That beam with blessings from afar, “And deck the radiant zone of Love! “Your Maker, the great God above. “Beholds ye with complacency, “Yet lacked ye homage from mine eye — “Yes, I renounced the holy train, “Which are the smiles of God to men!

VIII. “She Almar's daughter Arabel. was a votary, whose knee “E'er bowed at Nature's shrine, “And worshipped her with minstrelsy, “And love, and awe divine. “She heard, and saw, in each grove a spirit, “And nymphs each wildering wood inherit; “In every stream a Naiad fair “Pour forth her urn, and braid her hair; “A Genius in the shaggy dell; “A voice within the silent cell: “And peopled each airy solitude, “With visionary beings rude. “Sweet forms, of light and music blended, “On the glad rainbow's arch descended, “And whispered to her musing soul “Strains, from the harps of Angels stole— “Yea, to her purged, less earthly ears “Revealed the concent of the spheres. “Her heart so gentle, meek, and mild, “Upon my Arabel I smiled— “How could I act a sterner part, “To such a mild and filial heart? “But yet 'twas done—and, Oh, by me, “My gentle Arabel, to thee!— IX. “A Youth, whom then I could despise, “But since is lovely in mine eyes— “Whose name I fear to breathe, lest I “Should call some vengeance from the sky, “To wreak for him those wrongs in thunder, “That strove to wrench his heart asunder— “He came—with her in secret roved, “And the same wond'rous objects loved, “Rejoicing both in Nature's frame, “Whose soul again rejoiced in them: “Her holy hand and voice combined “Them both in will, and heart, and mind.— “Fond, rigid that I was!

XII. “Behold me now—what need I tell, “This was the calm secluded Cell? “My Daughter seen not to this hour, “I left my halls, my wealth, my power, “Far distant hence.—Now thrice the sun “His annual course through heaven hath run, “And from his high and orbed throne, “Beheld me 'mid these wilds alone, “In simple eremite array, “With crooked staff, and amice grey— “Or with my beechen cup severe, “My maple dish of humble fare— “Or tending, in a pensive mood, “The flowers that grace my solitude, “And round the oak, and o'er my cell, “Teaching the ivy flexible “Quaintly her wreathy arms to twine, “At Fancy's most fantastic shrine; “While, from the gadding spray along, “The blackbird loudly trills his song, “And while the widowed turtles wail, “And sweetly mourn their amorous tale;— “And sadly o'er the brook's dim verge “Ascends the stockdove's dying dirge; “While wandering o'er the brook's dim verge, “I hear the stockdove's dying dirge.” Warton's Ode on the approach of Summer. “And as to her sad notes and wild “I list by sympathy beguiled, “Perchance, of that thrice hallowed Well, “Whose waters, charmed with holy spell, “And dedicate to thee St. Loy, “Can many a malady destroy, “Some victim sad of sickness' seal “May at the blessed margin kneel, “And from my willing hand receive “The sacred crystal's healing wave.” XIII. He paused—'twas silence all around, Deep-striking, solemnly profound— Edwy still seemed to list, and thought His words again in whispers brought; As from his rapt and musing soul, Which mingled with the pensive theme Full many a moral, like a dream, The tale in airy murmurs stole— Like sounds in visionary sleep, That to the mourner seem to weep. And when his soul had mused her fill, And found that Almar, all was still, He dared not breathe—an holy fear, Like a keen spirit of the air, Impressed his powers with a law Of veneration and deep awe, As if the pulse of life were ceased, Yet not the thrilling soul released. XIV. But now that solemn pause is broke, Sudden again old Almar spoke— “In this deep loneliness, I was “Not lonely;—for fond sorrow has “Companions, whom the busy world “Knows nothing of, in riot hurled— “And e'en since thou hast been with me, “I have indulged my misery, “Apart in some nook of my cell “And seen the forms I love so well! “Yet that was sorrow's luxury, “Her dear infatuated joy, “And fascinated wretchedness “That pierces e'en the grave's recess. “But when I saw such lovely flower, “Blasted in that rude Robber's power, “A vision overcame my soul “With supernatural control, “And waked the thoughts of woe, alas! “Of what I am, and what I was. “Long had I dreamed my Child was dead, “And many a tear of fancy shed: “But I beheld her then in Heaven, “Sainted and blessed—and forgiven— “But I was not!—Her Mother, too, “With her was present to my view, “But pardoned not the rigor wild “Which urged to last distress her Child! “My Daughter's eyes were rich in ruth, “And beamed with charity and truth; “But oh, her Mother turned from me, “And looked not on my misery:— “O canst not thou then pardon me? “My Arabel!—if this from thee, “What may I hope from Heaven!—I cried, “And thought Despair, in giant pride, “Had all his waves dashed o'er my head, “And whelmed me, mingled with the dead— “Oh, then what sights, what sounds of woe, “Horribly threatened me below!— “Thank God! the vision broke, and I “Returned once more to hope, and die!” XV. Old Almar ceased his tale of woe, And Edwy sad and young, Returned him answer, smoothly slow, Sweet gliding o'er his tongue. “Their own peculiar planets rise “On all men, subject to the skies, “Malignant or benign— “The rays of thine have shone and lowered;— “And mine have not unmingled towered, “But now no more shall shine! “Their hour is past!—Yet since I told “To thee my tearful tale, “And while thine own thou didst unfold, “To one so young and frail, “Hope seemed to sooth my breast to peace “With promises of better days, “As if the star that rules my life, “Should yet again emerge from strife, “And bid the storms of sorrow cease, “Before it's bright ascendant rays. XVI. “But that, I ween, will never be “Until I am above!— “That Hope's the Child of Sympathy, “Participant with Love: “Oh, when their kindred voice to speak “Is suffered not, the heart must break! “'Tis like the many-raptured flute, “If left to rust alone, and mute, “Will it not lose its sweetness soon, “And idle be its polished tone? “Will not its tube be split and vain, “Which, haply, might have breathed a strain, “If fallen to skilful hands, so high, “Of such delicious melody, “As would have stilled the storm, and laid “The waves upon their Ocean-bed, “The winds within their caves afar, “And hushed the din of wrath and war; “Or to the breast by anguish riven, “A sweet seraphic solace given, “A pleasure been to every sense; “Preserving its own excellence.— “E'en such, O Sympathy, thou art, “The music thou of Sorrow's heart. “Be thou repressed, 'tis desolate, “And discord all—the brood of Fate, “Ravenous, then lap her vital blood! “But thou! with thy diviner mood, “When Love, by gentle Pity brought, “Awakens the accents of thy thought, “And gives it motion, voice, and life,— “Thou dost assuage their cursed strife, “Dost charm the adders from their prey, “And sooth the every pang away. XVII. “When Fancy shall the veil withdraw, “That shrouds from us those shapes of awe “Which in the world unknown reside, “The unreal scene disclosing wide, “Intelligent of either's Fate, “Together, now, may we debate “The chilling touch of frantic Fear, “That else would freeze us to despair: “And, haply, in this vale of peace, “Where the world ends, or seems to cease, “O father—in this Hermitage, “That calms my youth, and suits thine age, “Our time in meditation spent,— “Or grateful prayer—or hymned concent— “Or in meek charity employed,— “The waters of St. Loy enjoyed, “Wherewith to steal her agony “From this most frail mortality— “Or pouring o'er my harp the soul, “In richest luxury to roll, “With themes that fill, and lift it wide, “In extacy to Heaven allied— “Ay, here, O father, haply, they “Our lot may envy, who so gay, “And gorgeous, in their bannered halls, “Triumph at sumptuous festivals “O'er false joys, that in poisons end, “Which in the bitter chalice blend “Of fell Repentance, who compels “Her victims to the thousand hells, “That in the baleful draught are poured “For every smile of mirth deplored! XVIII. “Father, my counsel do not scorn— “The bursts, of strongest feelings born, “Thy soul's convulsions have been such, “As jarred thine aged frame too much— “Then come to St. Loy's healing stream, “'Twill renovate thine injured frame— “There miracles have erst been done, “And thou, in need, mightst hope for one, “Who art its priest, and dost dispense “Its medicinal excellence; “Then less to thee it may deny “That which to all it doth supply.— “And I will take my harp along “To aid the cup of health with song.” Almar consented, and arose His arboured entrance to unclose. They issue forth the Hermitage, Grey Almar's feeble steps of age, Sustained by Edwy's youth along, Whose Harp beside his girdle hung, Prepared its melody to roll, When Heaven's own flash shall touch his soul. XIX. Gazed Edwy on his Harp, and said, As mournful Memory brought the dead, And friendship with his Brother joined, Rushed sadly on his musing mind— “Upon this Harp, but known to me, “Such mystic characters I see, “As ope the fountains of mine eyes, “For one who owned its melodies. “While in the North our travels were “Rejoicing over Nature there, “I, and my Brother—Oh, my soul! “These swelling bursts of grief controul— “We made us to a Minstrel dear, “And loved his native strains to hear, “And gladly on his Harp he told “The wonders of the days of old,— “But Friendship, if its arm could save “Age from the all-remorseless grave, “Or lay together friends in sleep, “Had not let me survive to weep! “While yet the last breath lingered o'er “His paly lip, to be no more, “This boon of powerful harmony. “His Harp beloved, he gave to me, “With those same withered hands, which had “Erst swept its strings divinely sad, “Pensively pleasing, sweetly wild, “And energetically mild, “As oft he sung his tuneful lore— “But now those strings may sweep no more! “Of Morven was the Bard, and he “Descended from that Minstrelsy “Which owned in times long past as king “Ossian, of heroes skilled to sing. “And to one of those Sons of Song “Did this old lofty harp belong, “And often cheered the King of Men Fingal. “With tales of his forefathers then, “And called the Spirits of the Brave “From the bright worlds beyond the grave, “In lucid clouds, around the strain, “To listen to their fame again. “Nor had it in this Minstrel's hand, “Who gave it me, much less command: “And when I think of him, my heart “Will heave with sighs, my tears will start, “But which I wish not to control, “For they but melt to sooth the soul. “And for his sake this Harp is dear;— “E'en in those whirlpools of despair “Which part the Celt's wild mountain land “From savage Lochlin's adverse strand, “Where sank the Brother of my heart, “From this fond boon I would not part, “But wed it 'mid the raging deep— “And for his sake will ever keep.” XX. By the chill blasts of night refined, The air is all serene and kind, And through a subtler medium shows The extended prospects clad in snows. The Anchorites still onward move Through many a maze of the shattered grove, By tempest-shock in darkness wounded, But more by that wild rout confounded, That burst through them their reckless forms, More black than night, more mad than storms! Now Winter reigns o'er half the globe, And he hath thrown his lucid robe On Nature, and these Hermits rude, And Spring-beloved Solitude— But now each flower the Spring admired Before his cold touch hath retired, And each deserted stem and tree But wears a foliage mockery; Save that the holly here and there Hangs out her berries glowing bare, And the laurestinus, the bay, The ivy, laurel, still display Their ever-living verdure gay, Rejoicing yet, in beauty clad, While Nature seems a widow sad— Yet, lo! the Sun his face discloses, And paly boasts his dawning roses, In the clear skyey orient sheen, Like a young bridegroom, bright, serene, His locks with blithest beams adorning, To come into the House of Mourning. Touched with the thought, rapt Edwy struck His harp, and all his soul awoke! XXI. The Song of Edwy. 1 Come from thy halls, Son of the Morn! Joyous with golden hair; The frontispiece of heaven adorn, Triumphant over Earth's despair! Exult thou in thine azure field, Throned in thy shining car; And, with thine everlasting shield, Defy the blasts of war! 2 Exult thou! for thou art above This seat of woe and pain, Where man, a world, is doomed to prove Misfortune's iron-sceptred reign; Then, having vaunted, proudly vain, To conquer Chance and Fate, Shall moulder into dust again— Corruption's proper mate! 3 Exult in youth, O Sun! for know, Age may thy glories scathe, Strange pains may seize thy pride, and thou Wilt struggle in the pangs of Death— While Man, resolved into the sky, Shall triumph over thee, The Heir of God's Eternity, When thou shalt nothing be! XXII. Ere mute the strain, O Almar, why Recoil thy steps? why starts thine eye? “Pause, Edwy! 'mid the snows, behold! “Clasping his mother's bosom cold, “A sword yet grasped above his head, “As still in mimic fury spread, “A human form!—as, in his wrath, “The stormy blast had crossed his path, “And dashed him on the groaning ground, “In the same posture as it found!— “So from his hill the giant oak “Is cleaved by the strong thunder-stroke; “His honors spread the daunted plain, “Stately his head of pride in vain; “The Pilgrim pauses 'mid the vale, “And moralizes on his fall— “He lives!—he moves!—his ear has caught “The sounds—they have aroused his thought!— “Assist him—so—Oh, stranger! say, “Why didst thou press thy kindred clay? “Why dost thou glare so wildly sad, “And fiercely wild, as Vengeance had “Driven thee to madness,—brooding ire, “In silence stern, with eyes of fire.— “As thou some threatening statue wert “Of pale Revenge, that seems to start, “Travailing with thoughts so deep and fell “Would rive the heart and brain to tell!” XXIII.Stranger. “Have ye not seen those monsters of blood? “Those children of darkness, those wolves of the wood? “Oh, they have reft me of all that was dear, “And nought have they left me, save death or despair! “Then death shall be mine, this weapon that failed “To defend thee, my love! when those dæmons prevailed, “Failed to defend thee, and thy daughter, and mine, “Shall join me with thee!—but how shall it join?— “No! thou art not dead, thou art not yet in heaven, “But into the power of Lothbroch art given! “Then vengeance be mine! Oh, ye demons of hell! “Ye have left me that only—and that shall be fell! “Upon you I'll rush, with a husband's full fury, “And my steel with your lives, with your lives shall be gory! “The father on its edge shall reign, “And send ye back to hell again, “Whence ye came, with infernal flame, “To fire my halls, and rifle my dame! XXIV. “Oh, saw ye not the flames rise on high, “And illumine the night with a beaconing light, “A light that was ghastly and horribly bright, “And kindle the dismal and blood-colored sky? “A thousand fiends shriek through the fires, “And them with tenfold rage supply! “My child! my child! expires! “My daughter! so sweet in her infancy! “I fought for thee in vain, my daughter! “The flame surround thy loveliness! “The fiends exulted o'er thy slaughter, “And joyed in my distress! “Oh, thou art lost for ever: “To be recovered—never again! “Oh, never, never, never! “For thee, my love, I fought in vain, “Thou mother of my child! “Wife of my bosom—yea, my soul! “Profuse of life, my war was wild;— “His damned charms did my powers control, “And all my strength beguiled! “I saw him bear her in his arms, “While I, withheld by cursed charms, “Though breathing rage, could not redeem “Her from his mortal grasp, that chilled “To darkness that celestial beam “Which erst my breast with rapture filled! XXV. “He bore her away, and relaxed his foul spell, “Contemned my revenge, and the strength of my steel: “But ah, I followed him, and his band, “With rage in my heart, and death in my hand! “I saw him exulting, with torch and with song, “These blasted and withering groves among— “I stood to oppose him—but opposed him in vain! “His spell of perdition o'ercame me again! “He and his rout were gone, and she “Who was my soul! that other me! “Withering in his fell power! My brain “So burnt within, with such fierce pain, “Intensely flashing through and through, “I flung me in the chilly snow, “To cool its anguish! and allay “My beating heart!—'twould not away! “Not all the ice of winter could “Quench this hot Etna of my blood, “This lava of my brain of flame, “It burns, it maddens through my frame! “It scorches mine eye-balls; I can bear it no longer!”— He writhed on the ground, in pangs stronger and stronger. XXVI. Edwy surveyed the stranger well, And every feature traced, And almost, with a brother's zeal, A Brother had embraced— He knew the mien—he knew the tone— And stood astonied still— His trembling nerves a Brother own, And with his accents thrill— Dropt from his hands the Harp, and hung Beside his girdle free. Now to his Brother's breast he clung— “My Agilnoth!—'tis he!” And Almar of that name confessed A knowledge, which he still suppressed, Howe'er his heart might swell; But why so strange he started, now The Minstrel must not pause to show, But may hereafter tell. XXVII. “My Brother! Oh, my Agilnoth! “Art thou saved too from Ocean's wrath? “While every other head was sank “Within its oozy caverns dank, “Did that more strong than Angel's hand, “Whose lofty and divine command “Winds, waves obey—above the brine “Sustain that sacred head of thine?” “Yes! I've been saved from watery gloom “To find a more unhappy doom! “To see the dove, my bosom's mate, “Bereaved by the worse storm of Fate! “My Edwy! Brother, in the skies, “Why was I not as thou?”— “Arise! “Behold thy Brother! I am he! “Behold me rescued from the sea, “Preserved e'en yet to comfort thee!” “I cannot hope it—my harsh doom “So much forbids me to presume! “Or, if thou boast his name in sooth, “Thou art his Spirit, firm in truth! “'Tis kind of thee to leave thy bliss, “And visit such a world as this, “For me—but thou wert always kind— “And couldst not see me thus consigned “To sorrow, and not stoop to bless “Thy Brother in his wretchedness!”— XXVIII. Bending with his Brother's weight, Kneeling in the snows, In all the agony of fate, Young Edwy's prayer arose. “Oh, God! thou whom all should adore, “Thy will be done for evermore! “O, yet may I presume that Thou “Wilt to my supplications bow? “And to my Brother's breast restore “That peace he needs, and I implore? “Let not the rod of Fate dethrone “Fair Reason, seated sad, and lone, “In his wild desolated soul, “O Thou! who art the One and Whole, “The essential Reason over all! “Let not thy holy Image fall, “Nor be the immediate beam resigned, “Effluence from Thee, of human mind, “Before the woes he cannot bear, “And leave his heart all waste and drear! “Oh, to my Brother's breast restore “That peace he needs, and I implore!” “Amen!” said Almar, and again, His heart vibrated yet—“Amen!” XXIX. Moreover reverend Almar said— “Be not thy fruitless sorrows shed. “The counsel that thou gavest to me, “Edwy, I now transfer to thee— “Kindle thy soul! and do not yield “To fixed Despair the coward field!— “To St. Loy's Well “The fourth ternary is of three Wells, or Founteins, of running or liuing waters, all which in those days were famous for ther seuerall soueraigne vertues, their waters were supposed to haue against diuers and sundry diseases: the first of these is St. Loy's Well, which nowe is nothing els but a deep pitte in the highway, on the West side thereof, betweene his Cell and the Crosse, almost midde way; it is always full of water, but neuer runneth ouer; the water thereof, as they say, doth farre exceede all the waters nere vnto it; it was within the memory of man cast, to cleanse it, because it was almost fill'd vp with muddle; and in the bottome of it there was found a very fayre great stone, which had certaine characters or letters engrau'n vpon it: but it being by the negligence of the workmen broken and sorely defaced, and no man nere that regarded such things, it is vnknown what they were, or what they might signify.” Bedwell. our course was bent, “Forsake we not our good intent; “Convey thy Brother there, and lave “His parched lips with the healing wave— “And Heaven thy prayer May answer there, “And pluck us from this deep despair— “Sweet Hope may cheer us from above, “And link again the zone of love.” XXX. Thrice-hallowed Brook! thrice-blessed Spring! Who from the serpent tak'st the sting— To thee the family of pain Flock, nor do ever flock in vain! Thou art like that famed stream of old, In the most holy Book inrolled, To which the impotent, the lame, The lazar, for their healing came— When lo! a visiting Angel great The pool with life did consecrate, Health in his wing, love in his eye, His bearing power and majesty.— Thee would the bard renown with joy, Thou blest Bethesda of St. Loy. Then willows in thy clear serene Were glassed, with all their weeping green: “This Well is now to be seen in a field on the West of the high road, belonging to Henry Piper Sperling, Esq. on lease to Mr. Charles Saunders, surrounded by willows, close to the hedge row.” Robinson. “In a drawing by the late Mrs. Townshend, this Well is represented with a Hermit standing by it, who receives an offering from a Lady. This drawing was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1770-71.” Robinson. The Hermit and the Brothers kneeled, And 'neath their shade the spray inhaled— And he, who, haply, loves the rhime, Of olden days and bards sublime, Whom, now that Spring of Health obeys, 'Tis said, in these degenerate days, Hath late restored their mournful green, Though long its marge had shadeless been— Perchance, some bard there loves to list Its gurgling, while all else is wist, And overhead the virgin Queen Of Heaven shines 'midst the starry sheen, In all the loveliness of calm, And the sweet breathing eve is balm— If I were then that favoured bard, That hour should bring its own reward; My heart would feel the loneliness, And every thought its power confess; Its mild serenity would make My soul herself serene, and wake Musings,—of that first Paradise, Ere guilt or strife had marred the bliss— And, since, of all that war unblest Of the fierce world within the breast— And then I would the bosom scan Which still maintains the stamp of man, And blest itself, is unto all The blessing of the peaceful vale— And then my soul should see in heaven The due meed to his virtues given, That second Paradise, where sin, Nor storm, nor strife, may enter in!— More deeply can young Fancy ponder? Nor further must she list to wander: Too long the strain hath been withheld, From the gay days of storied Eld. XXXI. Hath that miraculous Spring of Life With good to Agilnoth been rife? Him Edwy tended well, and strange And wonderous was the sudden change. His introverted eye, returned To outward things, less fiercely burned, Less haggard-wild, and soon became More gentle, and serened its flame— The tears 'gan flow with copious tide, Which had before their aid denied— The draught but eased his agonies, The subtle thought that bade them rise It could not quench—the heart—the heart Still bore, as it had borne, its part! For 'twas not Lethe which he drank;— That stream is not of Heaven and Love! Hell is its dull and proper bank, And none would seek its power to prove Save they whose torture strives to slake The worm that now will never die; Though long it slept on earth—to wake More dreadful in eternity. Oh! who, in the rapt height of joy, With fear of change reproved, Could bear to think aught might destroy The thought of her he loved? Who in the depth of wretchedness That image of his soul would quit, So he from memory might rase, The mournful traits which blend with it? And well I ween, that Agilnoth Would not exchange his pensive thought For all the calm that deadened wrath, And deadened vengeance might have brought! Oh! how could he forget his love, And leave her in that Robber's power, Senseless of all her wrongs to prove, As he had never breathed the flower? That thought had been To him more keen Than the fiercest pang of his agony! Nor Edwy sad For that had paid This tribute to St. Loy. XXXII. “Blessed Saint! for this arise “Incense to thee, and sacrifice! “Be thou ever near the Throne, “To preserve the benizon “Of thy sacred Stream of Health, “More than honours, more than wealth! “Bending from thy pleasant rest, “Be thy heavenly vision blest “With the votaries who can tell “The sweet virtues of thy Well! “Be thine ear rejoiced above “With their gratitude and love! “Blessed Saint; for this we vow— “Bend thine ear! regard us now!— “To erect an altar-frame “To the honor of thy name. “Oh! may many a hymn be there, “Many an orison sincere— “Our's above the rest shall rise, “When the sun salutes the skies, “And the ruby-chambered West “Varies with his tissued vest!” XXXIII. Amid the Elysian groves above, Musing upon immortal Love, These sounds of earth, St. Eloy! share Thy solemn meditations there. The Blessed felt the powerful claim Of Virtue in distress supreme— Nor was he silent to the call, For soon his votaries, one and all, Felt their charmed ears rejoiced with sound Of heavenly music all around! Soft as the dews of morn it fell, And anguish soothed, with holy spell— The frown of Winter wild seems cheered, The winds are hushed, the heavens cleared; Each thing assumes a smile of joy, And all is silence, save The harmonious train that round St. Loy Their cherub plumage wave, And him, with supernatural strains, Convey from yon ethereal plains, Floating in his triumphal car, Upon the azural deep of the liquid air! XXXIV. Now Wonder's white, upturned sight, Beheld the cataracts of light Descending from the summit high Of the broad, calm, and lucid sky; A sanguine sphere of clouds surveyed Of fluid gold, and purple shade— And as in airy chariot sheen The awful form of Loy was seen! Sceptred in glory, crowned with power, Woven with amaranthine flower, In the sweet Land of Mercy rife, Plucked from beside the Tree of Life— And lo! the effulgent orb among, How shine the glorious shapes along, Like sweeping meteors, gorgeous blending, Flashing, immerging, and ascending, And now—attuned—the splendid choir,— Each rising on his halo bright, Bent forward to the dazzled sight— Sweep the rich rapture of the lyre, In tones so exquisitely keen, Soul-ravishing and thrilling,—they The mortal ear with sweetness pain, And charm the spirit from the clay! XXXV.Chorus of Spirits.Rise, ye children of the dust, Heaven descends to aid the just; Them nor storm, nor war shall harm, Famine waste, nor demon charm; With the stones in league—allied With the forest beasts, they bide— Privileged as Eden's grove, Ere sin scathed the Bower of Love, Shielded with the buckler broad Of the almighty arm of God! Trust in his Saint!—but, Spirits, list! St. Loy himself!—your choral harps be wist! XXXVI.St. Loy. Fear not! but laud the Eternal Name above! Brace up your loins, and gird your souls again— St. Loy hath heard the prayers of bleeding Love: He comes—with vengeance on the lawless Dane! In times gone by, from cheerless deserts, came His pirate-sires, and ravaged Freedom's fane, Blood-practised, rugged, wild—their tresses flame— And breasts were beat, and hair was rent, in vain. But lo, the Heroes Alfred, King of England, and others. take from Freedom's rest The fated steel, and scourge them to the deep! Her daughters braid the hair and deck the breast, Her Chiefs exult, her matrons cease to weep!— This Giant, remnant of the rancorous race— Shall he be suffered yet to rend asunder The links of Love! Go forth!—be strong in grace— Heaven, and St. Loy, avenge your wrongs in thunder! XXXIII.Chorus of Spirits Mortals! mark the semblance well — Heed this mystic parable! When the Flood — in ruin hurled — Whelmed the fabric of the World, When the wrath of God had past, Then his Bow o'er heaven was cast, Then it cheered the altar-train, And to them we sang this strain, Which to you we sing again: — God proclaims its radiant rays, Covenants to future days, That the laws of Nature's reign Every season shall maintain, And in his proper circle prove The Bow of Promise is the Zone of Love! END OF CANTO THE SECOND. CANTO THE THIRD. The Wood. “Within the navel of this hideous wood, “Immured in cypress shades, a Sorcerer dwells. — “Hence with thy brewed enchantments, foul deceiver.” Milton. I. Not to the House of Mirth; — where hidden Woe The loud laugh mocks, and strives with care in vain, Like triumph o'er the tomb of dreaded foe, Which trembles still, lest he may rise again; — Where study e'er invents new arts to stain, And, after, sear the page of conscience ill; — Where Death lurks in the mantled bowl they drain, By Feud preceded, and fell Mischief still: — Which Wisdom shuns, aye bent to Virtue's pleasant hill; But to the House of Mourning be my feet Most constantly inclined! For there the heart Is bared — compelled the eye of Truth to meet, That, undeceived, she may scan every part, Virtues of Nature, peccancies of Art, Free from the mists of Prejudice and Folly; And, 'mid her soul-ennobling sorrows, start, With angel-wing, to things divine and holy — Ever sacred be my Harp to Love and Melancholy! II. Ye Youths, ye Maids, who love the strain, Hither — oh, come with me again! Come to the spring of healing blest, Where, obvious on Air's azure breast, With spirits girt, and forms of light, The Saint to his true votaries' sight The vision of sweet Hope displayed, Like the young rainbow, first arrayed, With hues of promise gaily-flowered, And braided o'er the world restored, As covenant of Heaven with Man, That, that great Love which first began The world, ere He its links did sever, Should be renewed, and bind for ever Nature in order, and again Her sons in peace with God maintain. Be thy bright vision, O, St. Loy! Of love prophetic, closed in joy. Soon as their wonder — gratitude — That made them statues where they stood Of fixed extacy — resigned The first wild impulse o'er the mind, The Brothers, and the Hermit too, Were bent to prove the vision true: And Agilnoth gazed on his steel, And did its edge with triumph feel, Resolved to give, sublime in hope, Revenge its fell and ample scope. III. But lo! — beside that Well is seen A wild, and more than human mien, Albeit no celestial charm Is mingled in her solemn form; Yet she, I ween, is not of mortal birth, And owns not for her mother — Earth. They see her, and, recoiling, sign Their foreheads with the cross divine. I said her form was wild, and, sooth to tell, It was most strangely beautiful as well, But still not lovely — for it had an awe Which did appal the gazer, and not draw His soul to worship her supernal charms, And seek the world, yea, heaven, within her arms. Wild — as the strain each fatal sister sings, While o'er hell's loom they weave the doom of Kings; Strange—as their theme, and beauteous—as their song, While they their horrid labour ply along, Heard by a mortal ear, if mortal ear To list the song of Destiny could bear — Wild — beautiful — as those Valkyrior Who, in Valhalla's Paradise of War, Prepare the fabled God, and heroes blest, Celestial mead, in hour of mortal rest. IV. One moment, and she was not there, The next, she stood beside the Well, Like a tall apparition fair, In cinctured sheen, the bearer of a spell. They felt her presence, ere their eye Had caught her dazzling form of light, As if a spirit had passed by — They turned — and, lo! — the Image bright! Youthful, and yet as age severe, As stern as she was passing fair — Her eye;—it was prophetical! Looked through the heart, and searched it all! — Again with trembling hands they sign Their foreheads with the cross divine; And feel her glance cold, undefined, Thrill with strange dread the shrinking mind. She spake — and oh! her speech possest A supernatural accent wild, That was so fearfully exprest, Seemed as the soul it had beguiled, With the deep, secret, charming tone, The dialect of the world unknown, The potent word of spiritual agency, The spell of irresistible decree, Of power to wake the dead from gloom, And sway the spirits of earth and air To her wild will, and magic doom, The bane of Nature's order fair! V. “O thou, though in grey hermit-weeds, “Whose youth scarce life's first morn exceeds, “Whose hands the beechen chalice bear, “Moist with the balm to pale Despair, “Vouchsafe a daughter of distress “With that salubrious lymph to bless! “Give me to drink the healing wave, “My wearied lips with health to lave — “So may my current-frozen blood “Be, haply, by the genial flood, “To vital motion wrought again! — “And, if my prayer I may obtain, “This offering to St. Loy I give, “And, oh, the humble boon receive! “No Lady, howe'er great or high, “Can boast more wealth or power than I; — “Accept this Purse — scant though it be, “Know, 'tis of more a prophecy.” VI. The silken Purse, of magic art, Wrought exquisite in every part, As though from woof ethereal spun, With radiant hues bathed in the sun, She fain to Edwy's hand would bind; But he the gorgeous gift declined, Though all its netted folds agnize Pearl, gold, and gem of richest price. His chalice, from the spring supplied, He renders to her hands of pride. “The waters of St. Loy are free, “So be to all my charity.” VII. “Blest be this Spring!” — said that Lady so wild! — “That ne'er o'erflows, by no false bounty beguiled! “The reviving draught I feel “Glow throughout my veins, and steal “Pain and anguish from my frame, “That before, in snow and flame, “Chilled and burnt with fierce extremes, “And urged the soul to maddest themes! “I may not pause to tell them now — “Speed, Gratitude! to bless the hand “That did to agony allow “The cordial cup of solace bland. “Now, by the fatal Sisters three! “Without reward, such charity “Shall ne'er be said was shewn to me — “I know why ye from patience start, “Why ye would hence, with furious heart — “Ye, like the Fates, would mount your steeds, “And scour the woods with slaughter, “Vengeance to joy, while battle bleeds, “For Love's fair Spouse, and infant Daughter. “Stay — be not rash — that Robber's charms “Can soon unnerve the strength of arms; “Ye will before his sorcery stand “At best but infants — or to stone “Be stricken by his potent wand — “Doth Agilnoth forget so soon “How fell his death-attempting hand “So idly by his chill side down? “But wait —” (and from her vest she took, Of giant size, a golden book) — VIII. “Refuse not this — it doth contain “What all his charms shall render vain — “Behold where now 'tis opened — see “A spell! — oh, read it not to me! “Or it would blast my youth with age, “And storms in heaven — on earth — would rage! “Yea, e'en this Well's blest virtues change — “But spare ye not the robber Dane, “And it shall work you out revenge, “And turn his wiles on him again: “Each fiend he sways, at your command “Shall lift his free, avenging hand, “Against his master, who controlled “Him to his will, and spared him not, “But chained him to his savage hold, “A spirit to a mortal's lot! IX. “Yes! he falls! My Sisters, sing! “Ply the loom, and strike the string! “Weave his fate with mickle mirth! “The disdainful Son of Earth “Crush in his rebellion's birth! “Weave the disobedient's doom! “Joy above the infernal loom! “Give his soul to death and gloom! — “Mortals! believe my prophecy — “On this wondrous Book rely — “It shall not fail — though now begun “The God's dim twilight; and the sun, “The human-race, the stars were void, “By the power of Loke destroyed, “Bursting from his tenfold chain, “While antient Night resumed her reign, “Her substantial mantle furled “O'er the ruins of the World, “In the Ocean's cavern'd gloom “Sunk to its eternal doom, “'Mid the flames that wrap the skies, “Odin — all his Deities!” X. She is seen no more, — but into air Resolved her form, and mingled there — In Edwy's hand the Book is left, That still involuntary clasped — By wild astonishment bereft, He knew not what he grasped — As thus she melts away in wind, And vanishes to nought; His Brother, too, had not his mind Been fixed on one great, master thought, To more amazement had resigned — Nor Almar 'gainst its influence fought So well, had not the pride, combined, Of age, and of first nature, brought Resistance to o'ersudden fear, Or credence to the forms of air. XI. In Edwy's hand he saw the Book, And thus the words of Wisdom spoke — “Forego that Book — whate'er the spell — “Howe'er it aid — 'tis wrought of Hell! “In Him who put the charms to nought “Of Egypt, and a Nation brought “Through parted sea, and banded host, “And deserts, to his promised coast — “In Him, in Him alone, confide, “And follow where his beacon guide; “And He — our toils and perils past — “Will speed us into joy at last! “Trust ye in Him, and in His Saint, “Let not your eagle-spirits faint!” — XII. “Faint!” — said the Husband — faint! while she, “And Love, and Vengeance, call on me! “Faint! while a Brother needs my aid “For life or death!” — his Brother said — And from his hand the Book he threw — It fired as it fell, And vanished from their dazzled view Within the flaming spell. But now by magic art no more May their impetuous course be stayed; Their guardian Saint involved them o'er With air condensed, and thickened shade: Concealed from mortal ken they move, By Vengeance urged, and Heaven, and Love! XIII. No thought may sway the Husband's breast Save Love — and Vengeance fell, For Daughter lost, and Spouse possessed By giant Robber's wizard spell! But Edwy feels, 'mid vengeance, rise Desire to know his Brother's fate, And, with increasing fervor, plies Him briefly to relate. Though scarce his tale might gathered be From his distracted words, and wild, He found their fates did still agree, By Fortune ne'er from Faith beguiled. Delivered from the raging main, He sought his natal home again, But proved, his dearest hopes destroyed, The world without his Brother void — Till that blest beam his soul which cheered, Consoled his sorrows, and endeared — “And oh! — that image of my heart! — “She is bereaved from me now! “To her, my lost, my better part, “What is the world? — yea, what art thou? “Each moment is eternity “Till fate restore that beam to me, “And vengeance for my infant Daughter “Stamp in characters of slaughter! “Till then there is no peace for me “In earth, nor heaven — nor yet in thee!” XIV. From him hath Almar gathered aught, 'Tis buried in his silent thought, Though his brow-knitted eyes avow There's that within he would not show. Whate'er it be, his Pride, I ween, Forbids the secret to be seen, Lest that a Father's wild despair May for a phantom stoop to err — No! — he till certainty assure Belief, the torture will endure, That if the Truth approve it fond It go not his own breast beyond. XV. That Pride, nor Remorse nor Despair had erased From the bosom where first it by Nature was placed; Nor loneliness, nor quietude — Though they had of occasion reft it So oft to shew its haughty mood, Yet as they found they left it; Nature what man hath e'er subdued, Her throne to disinherit? Who can tame her high soul To his own control? Who curb her giant spirit? Though the Tempest may sleep, and the Ocean be mild, Blow the blast but again — and again they are wild! The Oak, though scathed by thunder, Still shews that it hath been the king of the hill, Though shorn of its leaves, majestic and hoar, 'Tis stately in ruin, as glory before; — And Nature will be Nature still Though the heart be rent asunder. XVI. Pause ye — and linger at the scene Where conflagration late hath been — The rafters mouldering in the fire — The livid flame, about t' expire — The oaks, seared with the sparks, so fast Thickening upon the midnight blast — The cattle in amazement met, From terror scarce recovered yet — The smoke, around that dusky wreaths Over the desolated heaths — The face of ruin and affright — Confess the horrors of the night. Thy dwelling-place of joy was this, O Agilnoth! — what is it now? There was thy chamber of nuptial bliss, The crown of the mutual vow. There on thy Daughter's innocence The father's heart was poured immense — And there — 'mid the noise of the crashing beam — Her loveliness was clouded! And, oh God! — there she sank, with a soul-piercing scream, In the volume of flames darkly shrouded! — XVII. That pang subdued, towards the sky Lifts Agilnoth his pensive eye; And Gratitude, amid his woes, In this soul-uttered vow arose:— Upon that spot of fate, St. Loy! The avenger of his rifled joy! To thee to consecrate a fane, Thy Offertory; “The Offertory of St. Loy is a poore house sitvate on the West side of the sayd rode. When this began, I confess, I cannot as yet learne.” Bedwell. Eld not having accounted for the cause of the dedication of the Altar of St. Loy, surely the Poet has undoubted licence so to do. Besides this, it serves to locate the dwelling of Agilnoth. — nor in vain: — For soon the holy fabric stood A trophy of his gratitude! Now Agilnoth more urgent grew, And if of Almar aught he knew, Impatient Vengeance might not stay To pierce his eremite array. XVIII. They thrid the wood, and climb the hill, Still upward wend, unwearied still — Though high the hill, and vast the wood, And thick the forest brethren stood — Thou, wizard Wood of Toteham's brow, An Omen to the valley thou! “When Tottenham Wood is all on Fire, “Then Tottenham Street is nought but Mire. The occasion of this prouerbe arose from a great Wood, called Tottenham Wood, of many hundred akers, upon the top of an high hill in the West end of the parish, which may easily be seene of all those which dwell elsewher in the same, as also in Edelmton, and into Essex. It is obserued, that whensoeuer a foggy thicke mist doth arise out of this Wood, and hang ouer it, or houer aboute it in manner of a smoake, that it's generally a signe of raine and foule weather; and in rayny weather, the streate lying very lowe, although gravelly, is for the most part drown'd or ouerflowed with water. This, therefore, to them, and to those adjoining neighbours, is in this case in sted of a prognostication: the like vse doe the inhabitants of Staffordshire, and other their neer neighbours, make of Snowden Hills, in Wales, and Malborne Hills, in Worcestershire.” Bedwell. Hovering like smoke upon thy crest, When mist involves thy fiery breast, Dark as on Snowdon lowers, In many an eddying volume rolled; The trembling tenants of the Wold, Prophetic of the showers, Dread the dark augury of the Flood, Which, aye to make thy warning good, Still on their harvest pours, And sorrow o'er the deluged plain, Which Hope had blessed, but blessed in vain! And ever superstitious Eld, As oft as she the Fog beheld, Accused the spirits ill, Who haunted then the wildering Wood, And raised the portent of the Flood That mantled o'er the hill; And laughed to see the ruin spread, And triumphed in the peasant's dread: But now she smiles to see The winter morn so clear and blue, The wood of such a snowy hue, From cloud and vapour free; And that the tempest of the night Had passed, when many a wicked sprite Joyously revelled there: And lo, the hill no threatening bore, And the calm azure sweetly wore A look of promise fair — But through the Wood of Toteham Hill They wind their way the while, All silent and invisible, Regardless of her smile. XIX. Thou giant Dane! feel'st thou not now The dew of terror chill thy brow? Nor thy haunted cavern shake, Which enchanted arts did make? Nor thy secret spells forego Their prompt obedience to thy low, Yet potent, murmurs? Sway they still Reluctant spirits to thy will? Or is Danger mute, though nigh? And still Revolt and Treachery? That, plunged from false security To Destruction's sudden hell, Thy fall may be more terrible. Nor amulet, nor talisman, Nor sword of Solomon — nor all Wherewith the enchanted Orient can Hold mortal man in magic thrall; Nor all the incantations wild Of Greece, and of Hesperia old — Though he, a favored wizard child, Their universal power controlled — Could save him from the sainted sword Of Justice and of Heaven, That hath his horrid haunts explored, To Love and Vengeance given — Yet still in proud contempt he stands Over that Lady prostrate there, Who clasps his knees with phrenzied hands, Her eyes without a tear, Haggard in anguish, to demand Her death from his blood-practised hand. XX. “Kill thee! what blast the fragrant root, “Ere tasted the delicious fruit? “That sure would be folly — and pity as well, “That vainly thy Husband should fall as he fell! “Not so did my fathers — the sons of the wave — “From Scandinia's stern Desart—the nurse of the brave— “With a conqueror's hand when they seized on the gold, “And the shrines of the vanquished, that could not impart “To their owners the spirit of Victory bold, “The spirit of Valor! the life of the heart! “They took from the Virgin the bloom of her flower, “Grew rich on its sweetness, and prized her the hour — “Then I grant that they left her to fade or to flourish; “To fall by the sword, or her shame sadly nourish. “But be joyful, my fair! — between their fate and thine “The distinction is wide — only less than divine, “Thou shalt be my queen — in my love aye delight, “The balm of my toil, and the joy of my night. “For ever and ever my heart thou shalt share, “Secure of my faith, and exempted from care — “The Lord thou lamentest so much could not love; “I but freed thee from him to exalt thee above — XXI. “Think not that 'twas plunder which fired thy dwelling; “'Twas Love, in despair strong — all other excelling! “On a moon-sheeny eve, when thy Husband and thou “Enjoyed the soft breeze, and the sun's setting glow — “I beheld thee!—and instant my breast was on flame! “Then what was — except thine own beauty — to blame? “Thee then, in wild fury, I sought to divide “From thy lord, thy protector, thy strength at thy side: — “But my charms they all failed me, as Jealousy had “Them withered, who even drives Wisdom's self mad! “But my Love was no coward, to yield to the storms, “Much less to a breath — when the cause was thy charms. “Be happy! — oblivion veil over the dead! — “Rejoice in thy fortune — be free from all dread — “Lo! spirits and men to thy will are subdued, “Thou spouse of great Lothbroch! the Queen of the Wood!” XXII. The sword of vengeance is bared, yet they Who bare it for a moment stay — Whether the Saint controls their course To unutterable pause, perforce, That the impatient faulchion may Be sharpened with reserve to slay — Or them free choice, with like design. Awhile such scene to scan incline, The minstrel skills not to divine. To see her kneeling at his feet, 'Twas like an angel to a fiend, As Sin had won the blessed seat, And Hell her Heaven lost regained: — So urgently to hear her plead For death from his remorseless steel, 'Twas like the song of sadness made By the sweet, love-lorn nightingale, That, in some melancholy cave, Invokes the hand which robbed her nest To join her with them in the grave, That she may be at rest! XXIII. “Talk not of love! hate be the theme “Of raving agony extreme! “Each horrid cell re-echo still “Hate! — and the same the forest fill! “Resound, ye demons of his spell, “The same on earth! the same in hell! “Till all around, above, below, “It rive his maddened spirit so “It start his stained steel from its sheath, “And dole my invocated death! “And wed me with my Husband slain, “My martyred, innocent child, again! “Or if thou love me — hear me still — “And, if thine heart may know to feel, “Let thy sword free me from my woe! “Which is not hard for thee to do. XXIV. “A Father spurned me from his breast, “Because I loved whom he forbade; “Nor elsewhere might my sorrows rest “Than in the bosom of the dead! “He too was in the world alone, “And sought the scenes of memory, “Where he his youth's past joys might own, “And bless himself with them and me. “One were our lives—our thoughts were blended— “Nor be our lovely child forgot — “Her cherub smiles our bark attended — “In death divide us not! “United in felicity, “Why separate in woe? “Why two caught up into the sky, “And left the third below? “In that blest world, without me — he “Must feel a want in bliss; “Nor can his joys all-perfect be “While I remain in this!” XXV. “It is! it is my child!” — The Robber heard, Yea felt, the Father's bursting word, And rolled around his anxious eye, That met no object to reply: That friendly shade conceals them still From the astonished Robber's ken, And on the Lady Arabel He wildly gazed — and gazed again — In Almar all the Father's soul Had risen above its stern control! Like the waters, confined In a barrier of mountains, Burst at length from behind Their strong cataract fountains; Like the stream from her cave Breaks the ice that late bound her, Rolls her bright-gushing wave To the spring-banks around her; Like the sun from wintry solstice freed, Rejoicing o'er the wonted mead; Like exile brought to native shore, All — all his years of sorrow o'er! — Thus sprung old Almar's heart on high, And flowed and beat in extacy; And with quick-mingling joys confessed The feelings pride had long repressed — XXVI. “My Arabel! my injured child! “But oh! to meet thee thus at last, — “Remorse might drive my spirit wild, “And all be dreary as the past! “O Edwy, gaze not on me so — “Canst thou forgive my haughty heart “That urged thy Brother still to woe, “Whereof the present is but part? “Or can he, 'mid his vengeance, throw “A thought on me, that would not start “His sword? — thy sword, O Agilnoth, “And make me Lothbroch to thy wrath!” Here Agilnoth found words, and turned His eyes from her for whom they burned — “If thou be he in hermit weeds “From whom my Arabel proceeds, “Who loves thee still — the cause of age “Shall wet the steel to keener rage, “That I may gain thy full esteem, “And all my past offence redeem.” XXVII. The waters to their level tend, And speed with kindred streams to blend; Each atom hasteneth to embrace, Attracted to the next in place; And soul to mutual soul replies, And heart with heart to mingle flies; So Agilnoth might not be stayed, But longed to break the guardian shade; With all the husband in his heart, He sprung unto his Arabel; The Saint was present on their part, And joined them in the friendly veil: At once, to the Dane's fierce surprize, She vanished from his bloodshot eyes — But she, with faithful kisses prest, Is pillowed on her Husband's breast! XXVIII. Thus snatched from fate, it seemed a vision Of Fancy, bathed in dreams Elysian, That from the ruthless grave restored Her lost and all-lamented Lord: And still she looked from her assay To find him melt a shade away. She feels him — doubtful to explore, With phrenzied gaze — each feature o'er: He moves — his lips to hers are prest — His heart throbs on her heaving breast — She is unutterably blest! No word might ease the extatic weight That on her very spirit sate — One thrilling shriek burst wildly forth, And bent her helpless to the earth — She shivered — sank — but not to ground — Her Husband's arms have clasped her round; Her head reclines upon his bosom, As on its stem the withering blossom — So sad — so wild — so still was she — So motionless and silent he — They seemed but marble forms of life — The Husband, and swoon-sunken Wife! XXIX. But thou! — 'tis not thy spell's control Benumbs the frame, and clasps the soul — Wizard! — whose ghastly eyes declare Thou feelst superior power near, That hath thy peerless prize bereft, Triumphant in the glorious theft — “Voices! but where are they who spake?” Why dost thou fear, and quail, and quake? — “The name of Agilnoth!” — why he Is scorned both by thy charms and thee — “She's vanished — gone — but how, and where? “She was of earthly mould, though fair, “And could not melt away in air.” — Thou art perplexed in thine own wiles, Taken in thine own netted toils — Thus the fierce Lion foams and frets, Entangled in the snare — and threats; Remembering not that they who spread The pitfall which deceived his tread, Are strangers as himself to dread; And well his fallen power disdain, His strength — his terrors — all, in vain! END OF CANTO THE THIRD. CANTO THE FOURTH. The Vola. —“Have comfort: “The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched “The very virtue of compassion in thee, “I have with such provision in mine art “So safely ordered, that there is no foyle, “No, not so much perdition as an hair “Betid to any.” — Shakspeare. I. Ye Virtues! guardian Spirits of the Good! Be ye not absent in extremity, As some have charged ye — when, by Fate subdued, Ye did avail not: — though, I ween, their eye Judged of the present too impatiently, Nor saw of hope the failure and delay Was Wisdom's work, to aid the future joy — But, oh! your ready ægis now display, This be the perfect time! and this the fated day! Be ye not absent in the groves of bliss, Culling the dew of time from heavenly flower, That may reward the present bitterness — Bend now with aid from your ambrosial bower! Be ye not like the gale, in needful hour, Whose distant breath the thistle's beard pursued, That should have sped the Maid to Etha's tower, With Usnoth's valiant sons: — so not in blood, By Cairbar's hate, had fallen the fair, the young, the good. II. Such were his thoughts, I ween, whose mind, 'Mid peril, girt with danger, Ay, still to harmony resigned, To fear remained a stranger: Such Edwy's thoughts, whose eagle soul Of thrilling song spurned earth's control, Borne by whose wing he soared on high, Secure, though death itself were nigh! And now he marked, undaunted yet, The giant Chieftain foam and fret, And scanned his dark brow, as it grew Deeper in its demon hue, And knitted o'er his fierce red eye Such gloom, as shades but ill The flashes that incessant fly In sidelong fury still. So lightnings from the pregnant cloud, Blackened with storms, advance Before the thunder, that aloud Peals o'er broad heaven's expanse. Nor silent was the brooded rage His meteor glances did presage, Shooting with wild and maniac fire, Desperate as wild, and fierce in ire. III. “What may this mean? a gnawing chain, “Invisible, and clankless, still “My struggling spirit doth restrain, “In secret — striking cold and chill “E'en to its inmost, as the hand of Fate “Had on its shrinking powers sate! — “Avaunt, ye doubts! suspense, avaunt! “What! bearded e'en in thine own haunt! “No! Lothbroch, be as thou art wont! “Ye are my victims! — ye, whose dread “Hath borrowed Darkness' guardian shade, “To meet me front to front afraid. — “I know ye could not raise that veil “Without the aid of power more great, “Who promised you ye should not fail, “That ye in me might find your fate. “Presumptuous, as ye were, in hope “With Lothbroch's outraged wrath to cope! “Mad that ye were, to tear away “From his fierce grasp his proper prey! “No tigress of her whelps bereft “Through forest rages more — “My faulchion, to the very heft, “Is clotted with your gore! “Though, congregated, every cloud “Give to your trembling limbs a shroud, “I'll burst through all, and rend ye thence, “And wrap ye in far deeper cloud — “Death, death shall be your recompence, “And hell shall be your shroud!” IV. Furious he said; and, with a giant bound, Burst through the veil: —'tis scattered all around: Its part performed, the guardian Saint dismissed The needless gloom; — and every shadow hist. Revealed, the Robber's magic brand Rushed fiercely upon Agilnoth, His steel is in the Husband's hand, And meets its falling wrath! Over his loved one in his arms, Insensible till now, Their weapons clashed, and waked her charms To motion's fevered glow. Then to her Father's bosom he Resigned his Arabel; — “Have care of her for me, and thee, “While on this miscreant's crest I tell “Our vengeance, and his doom of hell!” V. She is upon her Father's breast, But not as child her Father meets — Neither caressing nor carest! He but sustains, and she retreats Into his arms instinctively — On Agilnoth was fixed the eye; The soul was bound — the heart was bent On that important strife's event — In dubious opposition met, Their looks were into sternness set; But neither struck — their lifted steel Was edge to edge opposed — A pause — that when again they deal, The conflict may be closed. VI. But what of Edwy? — lo, beside His Brother, to defend, He stood, and round the Cavern eyed, In quest of some neglected brand, To soldier his unarmed hand, Every danger to attend, Present to redeem his thrall, Present to revenge his fall. — Ay, if he sink, his rushing strength Shall breast his foeman's sabre's length, And, plucked from his Brother's palsied hand, Wave in the Robber's sight the renovate brand, Like the spirit of Vengeance from Heaven swift-darted, Incircled with terrors, ethereally hearted, Incircled with fire, and sworded with flame, As sudden as lightning, and strong as the same! VII. High Lothbroch, master of the spell, With wonder had surveyed his steel; No temper yet Its edge had met, But into shivers fell! — He little deemed on Virtue's side The strength of Heaven was allied, And that the arm of Justice held A power not to be repelled: Albeit, I ween, His sword had been, By charms of darkness, wrought so keen, Bathed in the Styx, and forged in Hell, To make its edge invincible; But he, who on the Right contended, Well knew the foe, and how defended, And had, with hallowed murmurs pure, Blessed its weapon to endure — Nay more — at his high will, to sunder Whate'er opposed its dint of thunder! Of this the Chieftain little deemed, And less his wild presumption dreamed, That they, to whom himself he gave, Had but juggled to enslave His soul, with promises that were Meant only to deceive the ear, And wind him in mad hope on high, With fiercer pangs to fall and die! VIII. The sound of a whirlwind! — a rushing shock! — The bandit-haunts rock; Nor Lothbroch himself that tempest may mock: And terror came on him — the Mariner's dread, When the white herds of Neptune low over his head! “Muggiando sopra il mar'va il gregge bianco.” Ariosto. And then burst on their sight, though whence none knew, A Form, that seemed a Spirit to view, And those storms of dismay, The sounds of her way, That herald her coming in dreadful array — But lo! her robes of lucid ether Condense in deeper folds together, And to a more substantial form Resolves the shape that came in the storm — A form of this world — but still it retained The air of another — wherever she reigned — She parted their swords —'tis the Lady they saw So late at the Well, wildly beauteous in awe! And Lothbroch beholds, with amazement and dread, The Vola Gunilda — the mistress and head Of his Scandinian wild arts, whence his power begun, — And by the terrible blast of her anger 'tis done! And comes she in wrath? — those eyeballs of fire, Those pale cheeks of vengeance, confess her fierce ire, And the lips that quiver ere they breathe The fury that struggles her bosom beneath! The rage hath found way, and her maddening soul Is streamed in her speech, and is sealed in her scowl. IX. “Ingrate! 'tis well! — remember still “Thou art the vassal to my will, “Of my mere pleasure but the slave, “That well can take the power it gave; “And shudder, as the damned who feel “The wrath of Jove in thunder-peal, “In lightning-flash, to groaning hell “Speaking fresh chains, and torment fell! “Ay, tremble so at the revenge “Of injured Love's determined range! “That Love is turned to gall, and thou “Too well its bitterness shalt know, “As I have known it — canst thou pine “That my afflictions should be thine? “Hah, hah! ingrate and perjured fool! “Thoughtst thou of wrong I should be cool! “Away! to my revenge I sweep, “Like fiend by serpent stung from sleep! X. “What hadst thou been — a servile Dane “Writhing in England's conquest-chain — “Had not my fond unearthly heart “Ta'en in a mortal's bosom part? “Did I not give thee magic power “O'er sprites in planetary hour, “Invest thee with the robe and wand, “O'er quick and dead to bear command, “And all the elements to sway, “With mandate mightier far than they? “But thou hadst sought to rive my chain, “And all my secret signs were vain, “In vain awhile thy spells might fail, — “I proved thee, and have found thee frail, “Faithless to my love, and thy vows — “How true was that, how false were those! “But that and they by Hell were sworn, “And entered in that horrid bourne; “They shall return to upper air, “With all the mischief gathered there, “Fraught with the vengeance of the flame, “So many scorpions through thy frame “To sting thee into madness fierce, “And with eternal torments pierce! XI. “Blind and infatuate! didst thou deem “Thou couldst delude me with a dream “Of what I had not, thy vile heart, “Or force me from my right to part? “Ere that thou hadst presumed so far “With spirit-sight, and matchless might, “By fraud or force to cheat or dare, “Thou shouldst have had his watchfulness “Who holds the Rainbow Pontifice, “High arched from earth to heaven, prepared “'Gainst giant-inroad there to guard, “With sword, and that loud trump, whose sound “All the worlds answer all around; “Heimdal, whose eyes at once survey “A thousand leagues, by night or day; “And sleep as light as bird, at large, “E'er conscious of important charge; “Heimdal, whose ear, of sound divine, “Is wrought so exquisitely fine, “It hears the grass in meadows grow, “The wool on sheep, the falling snow! “Thou shouldst have been like dreadful Thor, “The might-sufficient God of War, “Whose thunder-mace to hand again “Returns, whence it was launched amain; “Thor, who at pleasure can repair “His strength, if e'er decay it fear! “Vain mortal, know, thou art of earth, “They deathless, of superior birth! XII. “Be not deceived: when Love runs wild, “And cries revenge for faith beguiled, “'Twill league with what it hates to speed “Its malice on the perjured head! “Thinkst thou I shall not take their side, “For that they are to Heaven allied? “To Him, whose fierce almighty power, “Did, in that memorable hour “When banded hosts of spirits high “Were crested 'gainst his majesty, “Hurl, e'en to utter hell's profound, “Who got them names the nations round, “Gods, sybils, heroes — with the rest, “The undistinguished crew unblest! “Nay — since we cannot hope that he, “Enthroned in his eternity, “Can ever yield to conqueror's rod, “Why, let us of the power of God “Take 'vantage, and his justice be “The weapon of our vengeance free — “And, lo! it shall be mine on thee! “I ban thee, with my curse and wrath, “Beneath the sword of Agilnoth; “From thee I take whate'er I gave, “And make thee as the veriest slave: “And this by the nine gates of Hell, “And by her kings and kingdoms fell, “I swear! — hark! with the sound of whirlwind they “Stamp, ratify thy doom, for aye!” XIII. Wild was the shock, and fierce, and rude, Of the blasts echoing through the wood, That rocked the Bandit's dark abode, As earthquake swept the ground! And then were sounds of horror there, Shrill shriek, and groan of harsher fear, That pierced and stunned the assaulted ear, Confusedly all around: But yet, those sounds seemed not of woe, But rather the unruly shew Of uncouth joy o'er fallen foe, And wassail triumph wild! — Now louder rose the yell and din, As though the fiends were rushing in, Howbeit the actors were unseen, Mysteriously enveiled! At once it ceased! — 'tis silence all, Whose very stillness doth appal, And hold the wildered mind in thrall, Conjecture strange and dark. When lo! — a rushing gleam appeared, And as a form of light unsphered, A Spirit for a moment glared, Then flitted like a spark! But oh! within that Sybil's arms, What hath it left? — of cherub charms, A lovely Babe, that cheerly smiled, Amid that scene of terror wild! Aloft she holds the Infant fair, But fixed, and haggardly severe, Her brow of frowns on Lothbroch lours, As though 'twould wither all his powers. XIV. “Rage! rage! — I laugh to see thee rage — “Fool! with a Sybil's wrath to wage “Contention, to deceive the heart “Skilled in delusion, and expert — “What didst thou think me? — deaf, and blind, “Contented — patient — calm — resigned — “Humble in dotage — slave to thee, “Proud when thou mightst bestow on me “An hour, scarce spared from out the bliss “Of dearer love's much sweeter kiss? — “Behold this infant! — vex thine eye! “She smiles upon thy destiny — “Her innocent and lovely smile “Exults o'er thee, and doth revile, “Who thoughtst in flame her death she found, “But little deemd'st that hovered round “A Spirit, by my direction there, “Secure from fire, exempt from fear, “That caught her as she fell, and bare “Her from the doom thou hadst prepared, “To blast thine eye — its meet reward, “Which had estranged thy recreant heart, “From her who claimed the whole — not part! XV. “Woman! why hangst so on my arm? — “To wildness torturing every charm, “That stole his love from me — 'twas guilt! “For which his life-blood must be spilt! “And thou be pardoned! — off! away! “I am no mother! — soft! yet stay! “I know not what it is to pour “A parent's joy, or anguish sore, “O'er mine own image, born in fear, “Through peril brought to vital air — “Yet, by the rage of love, I ween, “That rapture must be sweet — and keen “Must be the agony! —And thou “Dost more than common torture show — “Thou art a mother! — be it so — “Superior power prevents the blow — “The child be thine — And he shall pine “To see thee clasp it to thy breast — “That he is curst — and thou art blest! XVI. As Famine in the sight of meat, But yet by chains forbade to eat, Enrages more at the restraint, And more, as still she waxes faint, Strengthening in weakness — till at length That weakness overcome her strength — So Lothbroch, fierce with maddest ire, Rushed, in his soul's augmented fire, Sudden on Agilnoth amain! The knowledge that he fought in vain, But more incensed his furious bent, While wildering Desperation lent Fell Resolution to his force, And urged him on his rapid course — Well Agilnoth that shock sustained, Which, without sign or warning deigned, Came, like a sudden storm, at once, Ere mind might think, or eye could glance; Then words succeeded, loud and high — As when in grim embattled sky Two clouds encountering meet and strike, And by collision tine alike, Then wildly burst, and dash asunder, O'er the dark vault disploding thunder — “Fate bends not Lothbroch, still the same! “Though Heaven, and Earth, and Hell proclaim “My doom at once — I am still the same! “What! shall an infant's smile dismay “Me from my prize and proper prey? “Go — shew that cherub's dimpled smile “To the fierce lioness — beguile “Her of her rage therewith — then say “With what effect it scorned away “Her whelpless wrath, when that, awake, “Shall tear it limb from limb, and slake “Her torrid tongue in the sweet gore “Of the dear innocent she tore! — “Defiance in your teeth I dash — “— I reck not — as ye list to gnash!” “Love! Justice! Vengeance! Heaven! agen “In this give thy defiance then “Back on thy crest!” — the Husband said, And closely clashed each bickering blade. XVII. The combat thickens — who beheld, Mingled their spirits with the field, Which swelled or shrunk as rose or fell The strokes that either sped, Till vision, in its wearied cell, Dimmed with that watch of dread! But there was one, whose wedded heart, Still yearning o'er her child, Bore in that scene a greater part, With blended feeling wild — And while the Wife her lord confessed, Through all his peril pained; The Mother closer to her breast Her clinging infant strained! XVIII. As lofty oak the mighty blast Assaults, with strife repeated fast, Blustering through the frequent leaves, That echo back what it receives, Till the vast gnarled trunk, at length, No longer may oppose its strength; But yielding to the bolt of Heaven, Blasted and shattered, scathed, and riven, With heavy crash across the brook Falls, a wide ruin levin-strook, And o'er the green bank swells the waves, Turning their course to other caves — So pressed on Lothbroch's yielding frame The Husband's sword of flashing flame! The Giant felt his strength decay, Before that dint's avenging sway, Frequent, and fast, and thickening, now Before, behind, above, below — And, in the last extremity, Loud and more loud arose his cry, That called his band, To aid his hand, And save him from his destiny! — “Come, Osmund! Voltimond! — all! — all ! “Rush in! — prevent your chieftain's fall! “Aid! aid! — or else perdition seize, “Confound ye with mine enemies! “Traitors! — Hell take you all! — Oh! could I rise, “Your life-blood yet should glut mine eyes! “Styx yet should know he sent thee there, “Who still in death defies thee here! “And breathes on you, with his parting breath, “The malediction of his death! “May it pursue ye, stand before ye. “Gird ye round, and hover o'er ye, “Torment ye in this life with more “Curses than earth, air, sea e'er bore — “And follow ye beyond the tomb, “With an everlasting doom!” Rushed his soul forth, disdainful; quaked the ground, Shocked with the mighty mass — prone fallen with thundering sound! — XIX. Riven his plate, and pierced his mail, Battered his crest, and broke his blade, That had so late, with dire avail, Repelled his force, whose sacred steel Waved in a Wife's and Daughter's aid, Extended huge the Giant lay — His shield, exempted from the fray, Hung in its own armorial nich, Alone unharmed — unconscious — which His anxious eyes still sought — and ay, Exposed in utmost exigence; Still, still he bent to pluck from thence That stout circumference of defence, To oppose to the consuming wrath Of St. Eloy and Agilnoth — But vain! — in vain! — pressed vengeance there, His shrinking steps and failing strength, Exulting o'er his measured length; While fierce disdain from his despair Broke forth—as sunk his soul to Hela's dwelling drear! XX. Hark! Mercy of Heaven! what tumult and noise Disturb, as to threaten, the dawn of their joys? Those yells, and those shouts, that incessantly swell, — What are they the sound of his welcome to Hell? And are the fiends so jovial there they cleave The broad disparting orb with horrid sound Of general clamour, from their inmost cave, That sons of earth may hear the wild rebound? No! 'tis the offspring of Fancy, begot by Alarm, In perilous hour, and produced by a charm, In the self-same moment begotten and born, Fantastic and varying, as ghost tempest-torn! Far other import those clamours contain — 'Tis the Band of the Chieftain! they rush in amain; They had heard his loud cry — but, all too late, Came to save him from his fate! And now they vow, with general breath, To avenge their chief, or rush on death! But Gunilda hath met them — and rages and raves, Despising their menace high; Fierce as a fury, and wild as the waves Tost into the turbulent sky! XXI. “Back! back! ye slaves! — without his charms, “What can your frail and fragile arms? “Those charms he had from me — and I “Condeinned him to this destiny — “I doomed his vile ingratitude, “Though 'twas his sword that drank his blood — “His sword, that hath the might of Heaven “On its avenging temper graven — “Not I might brook its dint of wrath, “Though privileged from fleshly scathe! “But, if ye loved your chief so well, “To attend upon his state in hell, “Come — breast the point, and do your parts — “Urge 'gainst its length your stubborn hearts — “Till the ground, be deluged with your blood, “And ye float in the purple flood! — “Away! — this cavern stands no more, “I rase the work I wrought before; “And with my altered breath dispel “The fabric framed of many a spell! — “Then to Hela's dark abode “Swift I take my airy road, “And embrace the hero's soul, “Quit of cumbrous earth's control; “Still beloved, though loathed he fell, “Mine, and only mine in Hell!” XXII. Fled the fierce Band with panic fear, Fled like a herd of startled deer; Before her mien, so terrible And wild, their craven courage fell! Like the sand o'er the plain, By the desert blast surged, Fled the Bandits amain, To precipitance urged, From her terrors proclaimed! With the Band fled as well The Sorcerer's cell; By a spell it was framed, And destroyed by a spell! From the mutterings of power, So vanished the grim, Wizard-wrought, Teraphim! In the perilous hour, The shield, sought in vain, At the word of the witch, Disappeared from its nich! And the corpse of the slain, With a long peal of thunder, From the vision of Wonder Past away in its blood! And the Sybil has gone To her dreary abode, In her regions unknown! And the rest are alone In the midst of the wood! XXIII. Now all is calm — a calm so dead It falls with cold and heavy dread — Such lingering sense of terror still, When the wild storm hath blown its fill, As presses on the shipman's soul, That with the tempest's surging roll, Was wrapt up to the utmost pole! — Such as the peasant well may feel After the solemn thunder-peal, When, 'mid the wilds, the general still Settles on wood, and mead, and hill; And not a whisper of the breeze Wakens the leaf of aspen trees; And not a motion of the stream Disturbs the silence of the dream, That seems each object to invest, As life suspended were in rest — Such the suspension of their souls! Husband and Mother — and Sire and Brother — And while its frozen breath controls, They gaze uncertain on each other, As though they gazed on vacancy, Where forms unreal met the eye; Till 'gan the heart flow in the breast, With fixed ice so late oppressed, And to its natural glow returned, And now with rising rapture burned; The lines of memory now they trace, And catch the extatical embrace, Pouring all the rapt spirit forth In joy, that bursts beyond the earth! But chief the Infant shared the bliss, That triumphed in the numerous kiss — Her parents kissed her o'er and o'er, With fervor never felt before — And Edwy pressed her lip and cheek, So sweetly innocent and meek — And Almar, of his pride beguiled, Hath blest his Arabella's Child!! XXIV. The venerable Father stands, To Heaven raised his eyes and hands, — And thus he said: — “First unto thee, “Truth, Virtue, Justice, Clemency, “Thou God of all! we bend the knee “To adore thy love, and praise thy power, “Present to aid in needful hour! “My sons — my sons! — my daughter, join “In the all-holy work divine! — “Now, lo! the azure path on high “Chaste Dian treads, along the sky; “Attended with her virgin train, “In her own temple's solemn fane, “Who've filled their vestal lamps with light, “To adorn the columns of the night, — “And like serenity I feel “Throughout my peaceful spirit steal; — “But yet the wintry eve, though fair, “For Eld is much too chill and bare; “And Youth, whose soul with ardor glows, “Brooks not a night of shivering snows; “Once more, and for the last time, then, “Our Hermitage we'll see agen, “Till morn to give us lodging meet — “But then, farewell the lonely seat! — “To spring, to grove, to peaceful cell, “And hermit weeds — a long farewell! “But hail the dawn of hope and bliss, “That with the morrow's sun shall rise! “All hail, society and men! “My antient fields, all hail, agen! “Plains, walks, and hills, my halls, my bowers “Ye fretted roofs, and marble floors, “Ye lofty and paternal towers, “I bring ye them who shall restore “The mirth and cheer ye knew of yore! “And ay, the minstrel of our line “Shall tune our tale, 'mid feast and wine, “Upon his lofty harp divine; “And ever, ere he end the song, “This moral shall the theme prolong — “Whoe'er on other aids relies, “Save Justice, and the Charities, “Gains but of infamy and guilt “The pinnacle, where blood is spilt; “Firm though it seem, of piled dead — “The wrecks of Virtue's temples — made, “They who advanced him to that height, “Shall plunge him down to endless night! “While Virtue and her children stand “Secure 'mid storms on every hand — “Though tempest swell, and whirlwind rage, “Dauntless with ruin they engage, “And all good Angels from above “Sustain them in the strife of Love!” XXV. But, hark! far other sound Than mortal minstrelsy, Breathes on the silence round, Descending from the sky — Distant, yet sweet, the warbled strings Lift up the spirit's charmed wings, Consenting to the heavenly tone, That whispers visit to our zone. So far above this earthly sphere, Seems not to meet the natural ear, The strain, but dulcet converse find In secret with the unseen mind. — But now the air becomes as balm, And softens to serener calm; And, lo! a lucid radiance bland Invests the circuit where they stand — Louder and nearer swells the song, Still more distinct, and full, and strong; Ravished the heart to extacy, With such full tide of harmony! Again the maze of music, blended With that sweet vision of light, ascended To the empyrean realm of joy, The happy dwelling of St. Loy: And, as they reach the gates of day, Like the soft zephyr died away, And left the soul entranced, to dream That still she hears the harmonious theme! Fain would the Bard, in sacred verse, The subject of their song rehearse, If possible for sweetest Muse Of earthly Minstrel, to transfuse Into the dialect of mortality The liquid language of the sky. Spirits of Light! enthroned on high, The happy Sons of Harmony! Pardon the Child of Dust, if he, Unequal to your minstrelsy, Fail in the grosser tongue of earth To pour the ethereal rapture forth, Such, and so rich, and sweetly strong, As flowed in your immortal song. XXVI. The Hymn. High o'er the Thrones of Light The eternal Father reigns, The refuge, fortress, tower, and might, Of Virtue, when she plains, Compassed with death, with sorrows prest, With floods of fear, and snares of hell; Her voice ascends his temples blest! — In wrath he rises terrible! His spear he seizes; and the lightnings fly! He speaks — the thunder echoes through the sky! Shakes the firm earth! tremble the hills! The smoke of wrath the concave fills! And fire, forth issuing from his breath, Strikes the land with flame and death! Bow, ye heavens! the God descends! Darkness beneath his feet extends! Upon the rapid cherub riding, On wings of winds he flies abroad, Himself in his pavilion hiding, Of water dark, and gathered cloud! His brightness melts the gloomy veil, Pass the clouds! descends the hail! He gave his voice — its peals resound! His arrows quit the bow — Discomfiture and Terror wound, In lightning, every foe! The channels of the watery waste, The world's foundations are revealed, At thy rebuke, and angry blast, Virtue's Deliverer, Rock, and Shield! Part of Ps. xviii. Up to his holy hill In triumph he returns! Where, of consummate beauty still, The breathing altar burns; In sacred silence, watched by Love, The immortal incense fills the sky, With glory decked so far above The domes of earthly majesty, That Orient monarchs, when they enter there Shall with the peasant equal wonder share! Conclusion. Toteham! the Legend of thine olden day, To the last note hath on thine echoes died; But the Bard's soul still lingers o'er the lay, To muse upon thy transitory pride — The pride of times that hath been — blank and void — When all was Nature, big with many a song Of Chivalry and Fame, with Love allied — But Time hoth changed the scene — now houses throng Where once was solitude — and people crowd along. Where now thy Wood, that spread its misty shade O'er twice two hundred acres? — past away! And vain its Proverb, The proverb — “You shall as easily remove Tottenham “Wood.” — This was used to express things impossible, or not likely to be effected; for if the Wood be removed, which was very great, 400 acres at least, the hill, which is very high and large, must be carried with it, and therefore neither of them might be removed out of their place. This proverb, however, has been rendered nugatory. as the things that fade, Earth, sun, moon, stars, that change as they decay! The lonely Cell, the tenor of the lay, Its grove, which hermit tendance loved to rear; And, St. Loy, mouldering to Time's gradual sway, Thy rites, thy Offertory disappear; — Forgot thy Spring of Health! no votary worships there! Forgot, neglected — still my harp shall dwell On thee, thou blest Bethesda of St. Loy! As Fancy muses o'er the vital Well On years of storied yore, with grief and joy, Exults they were — weeps Truth should e'er destroy! Thrice I invoke the Spirit of the Stream With charm she may not question, or deny, And, like a Naiad, o'er the watery gleam She rises to my voice, and answers thus the theme: — “Wild Son of Meditation! Lover wild, “Of lonely paths, that Fancy may have play, “Thou reck'st not whither, so by her beguiled, “Thyself delight in thy created ray! “Wouldst thou that Truth should yield her heavenly sway, “And mild civilization be distraught, “That still the marvellous gloom the barren way? “Consider Almar — when to sorrow brought, “Call'st thou the calm he found, the happiness he sought? “Deprived the promises he once pursued, “Abandoned over to Despair's control, “Employed in no imaginary good, “Man's proper bliss, Hope rests as at its goal, “And idly busy Thought preys on the soul — “But when the dawn of social Love agen “Brightened his vision, in its varied roll, “He hailed his happiness returning then! “Know, Solitude's for God, Society for Men!” THE Farewell to Cottenham. “Oh! should it please the world's eternal King “That weltering waves my funeral dirge shall sing, “Or that my corse should on some desert strand “Lie, stretched beneath the Simoom's blasting hand; “Still, though unwept I find a stranger tomb, “My sprite shall wander through this favorite gloom, “Ride on the wind that sweeps the leafless grove, “Sigh on the wood-blast of the dark alcove, “Sit, a lone spectre, on yon well-known grave, “And mix its moanings with the desert wave.” Henry Kirke White. “Clifton Grove.” NOTE. This Poem was written at Islington, 11th March 1819. The Elm, the Waterfall, &amp;c. are not fictionary objects, but really indigenous to Tottenham, or its neighbourhood. — Iseldon is the antient name of Islington. I Why bends the Bard on yonder hill, Beside that beneficial flood, Regardless of its music still, Of sky, and field, and distant wood? Why looks he there regardless on The prospect fair, as fair may be? Oh! 'mid the charms of Iseldon, Fair Toteham! he remembers thee! II Though seldom all the day my roam Might measure o'er thy meads, and eye The Morning spring, the Evening bloom, And Noon reign monarch in the sky — Though long the way, and cold and drear, We travelled with departing light, To reach thy rural dwelling, where In purer air we breathed the night — III Yet — when much-varying Fate was kind, Those hours were sweet, wherein I sprang, Like Lark restored to wing the wind, Over the fields, and freelier sang! I marked the Rainbow in the sky, More lovely still than e'er before, And blessed the blended arch on high, Between the sun and sunny shower. IV And aye, the ivied Elm surveyed, Leafless and hoar, athwart the path, Upheld but by his fellow's shade, That saved his fall when winds were wroth; And still the winds his root assail, And still their rage he doth deride; Howe'er he threateneth soon to fail, With heavy crash, and ruin wide! V 'Twas sweet to hear the Waterfall, The liquid sounds of music wild — These scenes and sounds are sweet to all, But sweeter to Poetic Child! And, things wherein the vulgar mind Finds nought to love but all to fear, He triumphs in the roaring wind, The thunder, and the levin glare! VI Ay, when the wintery blast was high, And mist and night the road we paced, The Minstrel's soul heard Harmony, Saw Grandeur in the gloomy waste, Exulting in the darkling storms, Rude Nature in her rudest wrath! Oh! to embrace her dreadful charms, I'd meet her in her fiercest path! VII And I, on Fancy's loom have wove, A wizard song of Wood and Well, And wrought the mystic zone of Love, To deck the Hermit's hallowed Cell, And loitered 'mong the Sisters Seven, “At the top or entrance of Page Green, on the East side of the high road, stands a remarkably large and handsome clump of seven elm-trees, planted in a circular form, and called the Seven Sisters, in the middle of which there stood a walnut-tree, which, it is said, never increased in size, though it continued annually to bear leaves. The prevailing opinion in Bedwell's time was, that some one suffered martyrdom on this spot; but of this there is no authentic account, nor is there any thing satisfactory as to the original planting of these trees to be met with; but it appears they were at their full growth in Bedwell's time, and may be considered to be upwards of 300 years old.” Robinson. There is a tradition relating to these trees, which is told in the two first Stanzas of the second Canto of my Poem of Tottenham. That have three hundred winters brooked, Deep-musing, till the flash of Heaven The soul's electric seeds evoked. VIII Farewell! fair Toteham! — busy Trade, For ever my pursuer there, Compels me from thy rural shade, Thy walks, thy fields, thy skies, thine air! To Rainbow, Elm, and Waterfall, To Grove, to Wood, to Hermit's Cell; — Ye birds, ye brooks — ye pleasures all — Fair Toteham! — yet again farewell! IX Why bends the Bard on yonder hill, Beside that beneficial flood, Regardless of its music still, Of sky, and field, and distant wood? Why looks he there regardless on The prospect fair, as fair may be? — Oh! 'mid the charms of Iseldon, Fair Toteham! he remembers thee! POEMS. “At length, with a firm tongue (but mingling still “Much fancy with the fact, as madmen will) “He told his tale — his dream.” Barry Cornwall. THE Lament of the Bard. “And pens a stanza when he should engross.” Pope. I. 'Tis mockery all! — Who could endure the sneer That scowls upon my blank captivity? Albeit no chains, nor prison dank and drear, Confine my limbs, and bar me from the air, And stop the circuit of my roving eye — Such corporal sufferance I might better bear, Perchance, than this which doth restrain the soul, Which would beyond the narrow limit fly, That holds the mass of men in low control, In commerce with this earth's most gross concerns, The Sons of Dulness, reckless of the roll Of rapture, that inspireth him who burns With thrilling song: — Gain is their care alone; And poring on the ground, — although above The heavens in magnificence are spread, And all around is Beauty, Grace, and Love — They toil and toil, and ne'er exalt the head To mark the vast profusion, Nature's own, That fills the heart with transport, and the mind With Fancy, — gives Imagination birth — And makes the wondering gazer, undesigned, A prompted Poet — wings him from the earth To regions whence he looks, with high disdain, Down on the glittering pomp as false and vain, That worldlings prize — the yellow slaves of Gain! II. What mockery? Whereof do I complain? Of this — that I, who would full-willing roam, With eagle spirit, land and rolling main, In quest of Nature and of Knowledge high, And Wisdom and Observance, and each scene Which Fancy loves, where Meditation dwells, And to the Bard give wings wherewith to fly, Rocks, mountains, forests, solitary cells, Can scarcely steal one hour from Toil and Home, To mark Creation's wonders, and to glean Of that a little, which the Sons of Mind, In rich abundance, have possessed, and poured Into their Songs, that nought on earth confined; Whereof, with much regard, I have explored Many of soul-deep sweetness; — though to more A stranger, which I trust have sweets in store For me, — what time I from my labour strayed, With some loved book to feed my hungry thought Albeit oft chid by those who never read For wandering from the service of my Trade, Though but a moment — I could snatch no more — For I've not known the silence of one hour, To Meditation and the Muse devote! (Yet I am mute; — none hath a murmur heard;— Whate'er my thought, 'tis voiceless and interred — None, save my harp — that answers me again, And soothes me with a sympathetic strain.) Nor can long-time my fond ideas dwell On scenes they mourn to leave, and love so well; For with the sons of bustle I am pressed, Bereft of what my soul affects the best — Perpetual Thought, that in a heavenly mood Seeks silence, and the pensive solitude, Whence it can rise as high as angels can, And prove how near allied to them is man. III. This is not all, nor half the mockery That scowls upon my blank captivity! I know not why, save to afflict me more, Fate brought me to the rural scene, where I Tune, querulous, this Song of mournful lore, And walk not forth abroad in open sky; But, cooped beneath a roof of narrow space, Toil o'er the work that to the town belongs — Retirement, — not for study, that might raise Thoughts, worthy of the purpose of my songs,— But for the aid of business, that my speed May have no interruption; hence my time Is filled up closely with the dull routine, That ever rolls the same, and scarce my reed Hath space to breathe, or leisure for a rhime; And scarce one wing my Spirit can put forth, Galled by the chain that binds her down to earth! I had hoped reverse of this, and hailed the voice, Which told me, eve and morn, the rural scene I should behold, and purely breathe the air, Franchised from smoke of Cities, and the noise; And that, perchance, whole days should see me here; — And then I weened a part of them t' employ, Pondering on Nature's charms and loveliness, Harmonious beauty, and melodious grace, With all the music of her voice of joy; And breathing fragrant incense of her breath — Farewell, fond hopes! for I have seen your death — “But where are Nature's beauties? — they are gone — “And Winter This Poem was written in December 1817. hath congealed each stream to stone; — “And Winter blasts the leaves from every tree; — “Each field is blanched — there is no harmony — “Neither fair sky — but all is cold and storm “Which shrink and harrow up the human form.” IV. Though now 'tis Winter, yet it hath been spring, When through the groves the birds were heard to sing, When Sol was calm, and beautiful, and mild — And in these shades upon his Poet smiled? No, not on me — the City held me then, — Yet since, whole days, hath Summer seen me here, The Sun's proud, glorious season of the year, When Splendour glowed above the head of men, And Bounty blessed around their raptured ken — But not to me — And Autumn brought her store, And likewise saw me here — a milder glow Was hers, and all her waving fields were gold — I marked her not her rich abundance pour, I marked her not her calmer day unfold, I heard not her symphonious music flow — Or seldom — when I did, I prized the chance, And treasured every beauty that my gaze Won from the scene, in soul-extatic trance — Autumn's calm Sun, or Summer's fiercest blaze. Hath awful Winter, then, no charms? He hath — For those whose souls congenial storms delight, Who love dark Terror's wild, sublimest path: — And such my soul, that Nature loves when bright, But loves her best when most she frowns in wrath! V. Said I ye, Seasons, have beheld me here Whole days? — O rather I should say, and true, Ye strangers are to me, and I to you, For I, unhoused, meet you abroad but rare, Blithe bounding o'er the field or up the hill, Fanned by the breeze, and drinking purest air, Soothed by the murmuring of a purling rill, Charmed by the circling objects of delight, Which Nature loves to press upon the sight, And through the heart and joyous spirit thrill.— No! — but the Sun upon my window glows; I feel his warmth, — I feel the breeze that blows, — Which, as in scorn, seem to invite me forth, To gaze upon the enchantments of the earth! Thus shine the sun-beams through the abhorred grate, That mars them with its shade, of prison-gate, Whose hinge shall never turn t' enlarge a limb Of the sad victim, but where scoffing him, Bare stands Captivity with laughter grim, And points the spot, where Freedom's vallies lie, Where he can enter not, to vex his eye, — Yet mine is more — his thoughts can revel wide; And though the dreams of trouble may annoy, Yet he can gaily image those of joy — But this stern Trade hath unto me denied! Mine is the heavy durance of the soul, Which would in everlasting rapture roll — Chains that the body and the mind control! For I am like a lark in cage confined, Who feels his wings, and thinks to mount the wind; I spread my plumes, and then attempt to soar, — But Disappointment makes my sorrows more! VI. I've ever felt this passion in my breast, Fluttering for thought; — nor can my memory find, Since it could harbour such exalted guest, When it hath been without this thoughtful mind: While others, fellows of mine infant-age, Looked to nought higher than their elfin play, Nor were expected, — I explored the page, — And then Religion burst with heavenly day! And though she was too glorious and too bright For the weak, eaglet gaze of my young sight; — And though I could not pierce the mysteries, Which are the darkness of excessive light, And mantled her, scarce pierced e'en by the wise; — Yet were her charms congenial to my mind: — My thrilling heart their awful beauty won To cogitation pleasing; then I framed Glorious conceptions — and I hold them still — How to exist on earth as if in heaven — But thou, Trade! wouldst forbid me to fulfill These purposes, her dictates, too refined For thee — I am not meet to be thy son! I could not stoop to thy low means of gain; Means opposite to all commandments given By God to man, yet practised oft unshamed — And I should tremble at the oath of form, Which many of thy sons, without alarm, Without consideration, often swear, Albeit they the Witness-God profane! — I could not qualify it, as they do, Guiltless pronounce myself, and free from care, Think Heaven's own justice will be partial too! — Yes! all can witness, in my nestling days, Instead of toys, books were my chief delight, Till I felt emulous of their high praise, Who poured their spirit, in a flood of light, O'er every lofty theme; then glowed my heart Within me: Thought became my better part, — As, sooth, it should be with immortal souls — Though, struggling oft, still lay its fire concealed, Ambition undefined — 'till Milton's song To apprehension gradually unveiled, Dissolves the darkness that prevailed there long — Then from its gathered cloud the lightning rolls! The lightning of my Spirit burst its cloud, And straight the wild and magic numbers came; My Harp no more was silent, breathed aloud Its sounds of power, and its thoughts of flame! VII. Sweet Poesy! whose gentle heart is fraught With sensibility and tender thought; Within whose eye is seen soft Pity's tear, Like water shining in a diamond rare, Rendering it thence more lovely and more fair; Whose liquid language is that of the sky, Such as the stars' angelic symphony, Which is too pure for the unpurged ear Of gross unscienced mortals, who thence scorn The things that are too high for their low-borne, And thought-estranged souls — and name thee, wild Enthusiast, and Fancy's maddest child — Enthusiast! — 'tis the name that I love best — The very name congenial to my breast! — And when they term thee so, then most they raise, In my esteem, her whom they would abase.— Enthusiast of Nature! Soul enflamed With fire from her great Altar built by God, And good by the wise Architect proclaimed! Thine is the bliss of Angels free from sin! O kindle all my spirits with thy fire!— But why? — Trade calls me down to his abode — Still thou'rt the active principle within! To him my passive frame alone I give, For I have never yielded so my soul, Though subject be my thoughts to his control; — Albeit he smother them, yet still they live, And from their darkening shrouds again respire! Then there I triumph o'er his tyrant power — Yet when will come the date of Freedom's hour? And who will lead me up the hill of Fame, And twine the laurels round my humble name? How would I bless the hand! my song should crown, And pay him back those laurels of renown! Is none to answer? — like an eagle young, Why leave I not mine eyry then, and dare, Fearless, the wide and dangerous tract of air, On the broad banner of my pinions hung? VIII. Who would not, for the joys to thee belong, Endure the sorrows of a Child of Song? For where's the mortal so completely blest, That trouble never interrupts his rest? Why launch I not out on this world's wide sea? And if storm-taken—well—so let it be — I reck not! — It were but to grasp at more Than I could reach, as many have before — And they have borne it — I could bear the same — Be mine their sorrows then, if mine their fame! And have I not, where I the griefs have read Of many of the learned, and tuneful dead; — How that the World had brought its tempest forth, To beat their eagle spirits down to earth, To its vile level — And, when I have heard Their sorrows on their magic harps preferred — Have I not, as each melancholy lay Dissolved my soul in passion all away, E'en envied them their woes, and with wild zeal, To plain like them, e'en wished like them to feel? Then swell, ye billows! burst above my head! And I, like them, will wake my harp to life, That shall reprove you for your uproar dread, And calm my soul amid external strife! For it shall have the power of Orpheus' strain, And charm me from my fate with its sweet tone; — While its kind voice I listen to alone, Frustrate the storm shall drive along the plain, And threatening thunders roar — winds rage in vain! Then swell, ye billows! high as Jove's arched roof! I reck ye not — for I am tempest-proof! On attaining the Age of Twenty-one 5th July, 1820. “Thou warble wild, of rough, rude melody! “How oft I've wooed thee, often thrown thee by; “In many a doubtful rapture touching thee, “Waking thy (early) notes in many a sigh.” Clare — “To my Oaten Reed.” Hour of Maturity! — whom Bards have hailed, Sanguine of manhood's hope, though boyhood's failed — Quit of constraint, we now begin to be; Escaped dependance, feel that we are free The world's our own — to win or lose — name, Brilliant or dark — and each alike is fame! But let me live, and die, without renown, If Virtue's sanction make it not her own O, let the visions of my youth, wherein I revelled, as an Eden free of sin, Dreaming of immortality, be void, If the fond boon may never be enjoyed But by the taste of the forbidden fruit; — And be the serpent Hope for ever mute: 'Tis but Ambition in an angel-guise, The bane of earth, a rebel to the skies! — And that were a great sacrifice — for they Have been my hearted solace — night and day; And when I revelled in them, I did seem The only being in the fairy dream, Which was the Universe — and there, methought, My mind held mastery, and its riches wrought E'en to her own imaginative will, And modelled the creation it did fill, Fixing on but one orb her eagle ken, Glory! — the crown of angels and of men! But still of thee, O Virtue! This refers to an unpublished Poem of the Author, written at different intervals between the age of 14 and 20, and extending to about 10,000 lines. have I sung, And to thy praise mine early harp was strung. Fancy had scarcely language, language force, When from thy high and sempiternal source, I dared the stream of numbers to deduce, And weakly wrestled with the mighty Muse, Upon her mountains, and beside her streams, Vocal alike with the sublimest themes, That did with harmony the spirit thrall, Giving her strength, and charming me of all, Yet what it captivated still inspired — Weakly, but resolutely, and untired, 'Till she took pity on my youth extreme, And bade me rest upon her heart, and dream That I of her was well-beloved, and there In a delicious slumber, and so clear That every sense seemed perfect, and mine ear Conversant with the music of the spot, And my soul held communion, felt and thought, And saw all objects as they were — (and she Bending her bright blue eyes down upon me, And her lips bathing mine, my brow, mine eyes, With kisses made, and modulate of sighs) — Lapped, I was happy as Endymion, when Absorbed in Dian's love in Latmos' mystic glen! And then she sang to me, e'en as I slept, Sweet soul-deep songs, whose melancholy crept Over my kindled spirit till it wept Tears, such as seraphs shed, when they behold A sight of pity melts their burning mould To liquid sorrow, till themselves do ponder Upon their nature's change in awe and wonder, Then feel themselves more heavenly? Judge how I Felt — kindled to such height of extacy! — Then from such visions waked and so inspired, I seized the Harp that next me hung, and fired The tragic chords with one wild whirlwind sound, Though for awhile the immortal Sister frowned, Who swayed that instrument, Melpomene; Twas but to prove what daring was in me — And then she smiled — and with a fiercer note, Encouraged thus, and fiercer still, I smote The tragic chords — and still she smiled, and I Charmed from the grave of an old history The tale of Periander A Tragedy begun about the same time with the above-mentioned Poem, and finished before the Author was 15., and the rage Of many passions thundered o'er the stage; And then, each awful pause between, I turned To the old theme — Astrea's Altar burned With holy incense — then I seized again The tragic Harp, and waked a different strain. Ossian flashed on me — Lora's field arose, Another Tragedy, called the Battle of Lora, and written in the years 1816 and 1817. Upon the shadowy scene, and many woes, Aldo and Lorma loved; and eke a Maid Was fashioned forth by Fancy's second aid. — Those numbers ceased; and in the interim Of silence, full of Fancy, nothing dim, I paid my vows to Virtue, and her shrine Harmonized with the song she made divine. And, for the time her service ended, then I mused apart, or mingled among men, Howe'er reluctantly, and with a sigh That came from the deep heart's intensity, Murmured a lover's farewell, just to say, With what a pang I tore myself away. And often as I wandered, would an air Of exquisite unearthliness, — so clear, So sweet, and fine withall, “that nothing dwelt “'Twixt it and silence;” yet so deeply felt, That the soul knew it a reality,— Come, like a dear and lingering memory, Of the delightful moments with the Muse Spent in mysterious dalliance; — and diffuse The breathings of her spirit upon mine, Till the world disappeared, and I became divine! Dear Eve! I am thy votarist, and I love Thy dim and sacred shadows, far above The broad and garish day — for then it is I feel abstracted to such extacies, Glorious conceptions, as are not of earth, And have spiritual, if not heavenly birth; And then it was, when all insensibly Glided the Hermit's Tale The Legend of St. Loy. within me — I Bade the world's toiling care's farewell, and sent My Spirit on strange quest — nor where she went Heeded, nor what she brought — and so I made A sound and substance out of less than shade. Astrea! then of thee my harp took up A wilder, sadder strain — on Ida's top The Muse embraced me, and my sorrow bore, Mingled her tears with mine, and I loved her the more. And so the day went down — and to my bed Came sage and sad Melpomene, and shed Her inspiration on my visions — gave Force to my thoughts, and rolled them wave on wave; Till in a phrenzy, with a lightning flash, I struck the chords, and brake them with the crash: Yet nought thereat displeased, she urged me still, Till I the mighty labour did fulfil. Short space the task required, for such the zeal Inflamed me then, enthusiasts nothing feel To what I felt, when with impatient touch I hurried o'er the strings, and maddened them too much! This alludes to another Drama, written in less than six weeks, and under emotions which are but feebly described in the text. Brus! I have sang of thee In the Poem, entitled, “Tottenham.” but not in field, When the fierce battle raged around thy shield, But when thou wert as I am — secret — lone — Breathing from the soul's centre, with a tone Of proud despair, Hope's aspirations, telling Inanimate Nature that intense, in-dwelling Thought which we scorn to share with man, and deem She hath an ear for — Life is but a dream: — Thine was a glorious one, and 'twas fulfilled; — Oh, what a ground whereon for Hope to build! Thus have I worn my youth — all circumstance, All duty — destiny — and ignorance, Opposed to the beloved pursuit; and yet, Thus my mind's secret energies have met What the world thought omnipotent, nor knew Whate'er impedeth Fancy doth renew, And strengthèn the motives unto more — but here, I challenge Malice' self to make appear, I have neglected aught of man's concerns, Where man had claim upon me — still there burns A flame within me, which if not the same That kindles Poets unto faith and fame Is a strange something, and without a name — Hope leads me on! and in the scene of life, Henceforth I have my part — or peace or strife — My character's commenced — e'en as the seed, So must the fruit be — I have much to heed! My way is among shoals, and perilous storm, Where blest is he who 'scapes with little harm, Where the whole man's absorbed, resisting still The present, or preventing future ill; Militant, provident, the heir of pain, For ever striving never to obtain, Without due leisure to be happy long, With little left for love, and none for song. But yet, forsake me not, ye Muses! ye Have many pleasures yet in store for me: Great Love — great Nature — Beauty — Order — all The charities, whose voice so soft and small Is heard not by the million — these are yours; — And such their worth for ever it endures, Making Man — Man, and to the Poet giving A name, for ever bright, for ever living! THE Grave of the Bard Written August 1818. “Depart on thy wings, O Wind! thou canst not disturb the rest of the Bard. The night is long, but his eyes are heavy. Depart, thou rustling blast.” Ossian — on himself. “Berrathon.” Upon the holy domes of God The moonlight sweet and lovely fell, And on the flowery turf it glowed Of a meek Poet's narrow cell. There, 'gainst the arching cypress trees, Reclined a kindred soul — alone, Who loved to hear the wild night-breeze Whistle through leaves an airy moan. And oft his Harp, that hung on high, Answered the kisses of the gale, With such a sad and long-drawn sigh, As almost told the tender tale. The musing Friend renewed his grief, And all the Dead rushed on his mind; Then from his Harp he sought relief, And poured these numbers undesigned: Dear Son of Fancy! fare thee well! Be thine abode in Heaven blest, Peace be within thy narrow cell, And undisturbed thy shrouded rest! Thou lovedst to see Aurora's blush; The mist upcurling from the stream; The dews impearl tree, floweret, bush — Then muse in rapt ideal dream! To contemplate these gems of night; To gaze the meteor's vagrant glare; And in the nightingale delight, With thrilling breast and blissful tear! The Fair — the Wonderful — the Wild — The Dread — the Grand — thy soul confessed; Thou wert a true Poetic Child, And with an eagle spirit blessed! But yet that spirit was too strong For the weak frame which held her flight, And strained its powers too oft and long, Stretched forward to aërial height. Thus poised between the two extremes Of Matter and of Spirit wrought, Too weak to drink the solar beams, For earth, too much of subtle Thought; Ethereal Essence! Spark of Heaven! The Lightning shot into the soul! Whose shocks electric, hourly given, Prey on the life, and wear the whole. Yet the Sun's glory he inhaled, And stretched his soul beyond his strength, Till the worn threads of being failed, Rare, and refined, and burst at length. Around thy grave shall fairies meet, And youths and maids who loved thy song, And Fancy scatter every sweet, And Pity plain her dirge along! Dear Son of Fancy! fare thee well! Be thine abode in Heaven blest, Peace be within thy narrow cell, And undisturbed thy shrouded rest! Versification of the Prose Part of Satan's Speech, from the “Christiad” of Henry Kirke White. XXXI. Ye Powers of Hell! no coward's is my soul — Of old I proved it — Who the forces led That shook Jehovah's throne above the pole? Who with Ithuriel coped? — the thunders dread Of the Omnipotent? — Who, when ye fled, Followed by wrath and flame, — who waked ye first From that infernal lake, your burning bed, To fell revenge? Who dared alone the worst, And through the void obscure from out the prison burst? XXXII. Who brought ye o'er the unfathomable abyss, To this delightful world, and bade you reign? Mine was the peril — yours possession, bliss — I won — and ye enjoyed the new domain, The thrones that totter now — then, who shall stain My valour, chiefs, with doubt, that I would lose Tamely the power I had such toil to gain? Yon treacherous fiend Moloch.? — what he! shall he traduce The strength of Satan's Sword, who breathes but by abuse — XXXIII. Lives but on death — on the defenceless preys — Who sucks the blood of infants — doth delight But in ignoble cruelty, and sways Unequal strife? — Away! thou bane of fight! Who shunn'st the day, and lurkest for the night, To hover, like a cormorant, o'er the plains, And feed upon the flesh of wounded knight, And drench the last drop from his bleeding veins, And greatly triumph o'er a hero's dying pains! XXXIV. True bravery is from rashness as remote As trembling hesitation, O my peers!— Then be our counsel cool, and calm our thought, Not warped by fury, nor subdued by fears, That Resolution, steadfast as the spheres, Fixed — fierce as Hell, our purposes may rear! The time which lost us Heaven by proof declares, That Power is His who doth the thunder bear, — But Subtlety is ours — we are his equals there! 17th April, 1819. SONG, to? There is a flower in Ocean's caves, 'Tis sweeter than any of ours, It blossoms unseen beneath the waves, In the Mermaid's inscrutable bowers — The sun of our heaven never shone on its hues; But it in its coral bed is tended By spirits that no one hears or views, Though of light and music blended — There is a love which is like that flower; It dwells in the silent bosom; It never was blessed by thy smile any hour, Yet never hath ceased to blossom. Of Beauty 'twas born — by Mind is it nourished, That made to itself that vision divine; — With the invisible thoughts of the heart it hath flourished, Its sisters and shadows — its cradle and shrine. The flower of Ocean is blessed where it bloometh, Nor pines for the day-star it never may see; But the love of my bosom its altar consumeth, For the form of the vision it worships in thee! STANZAS On the Death of His Most Gracious Majesty KING GEORGE THE THIRD. Sacred the grief that balms the death of Kings, And shrines their memory in the heart's true blood: With such the rising Muse her tribute brings, To mourn the nobly great, the greatly good. The rising Muse, who ever wreathes her harp With the dark cypress and the sprig of yew, Whose soul is sadness, fortune ne'er may warp, The mood of mind to melancholy true. The passing-bell Hath tolled its knell For a Star of Brunswick set! But few hours gone O'er the Royal Son The Duke of Kent. Was the eye of Sorrow wet! The tear was not dried, When, pealing wide, Came the omen again on the gale — Whose tale doth it tell, That pausing knell? For the Monarch of England wail! The King of the fair and the free — The Lord of the bright and the brave — And such shall dew the cheek for thee, And worship at glory's grave! But didst thou in glory set? Alas! for thee — thou wert shrouded in gloom, And gone from the eye, ere thy hour were come, To sink on the Western hill's bright coronet, In the hues of the heavens — that beautiful pyre, Whereon, like the phœnix, the sun dies in fire! Thy day was a summer one, Lasting and bright, But its setting no splendour won From its length or its light — The cloud and the blast Came sudden and darkling,— Through the shadow they cast Not a gleam was there sparkling — But the eve of the summer was wintry and wild, And the land was a desert where Hope never smiled— Thou wert shorn of the rays they may envy who can, But, bereft of the Monarch, we felt for the Man! Weep not, for he was tearless in his woe, And life was lost in him who bore it so, Unconscious of its being or its blindness — The scions of his house were rent away, And that he felt not, oh! 'twas Heaven's kindness — Else had his spirit been subdued to clay, — For they were portions of it, and his heart, — And maddened with the fierce sense of the anguish That of his phrenzy even had been part — And he again had seen them fade and languish, And from the tomb raved for them, till they came — Then he had blessed them — and all hope and fear Felt, e'en as he before had felt the same, Watched by the bed of death, and again maddened there! Weep not — From Nature's night that he is free; Free from the fetters of the soul diseased, The mind, the image of the Deity, From its long heavy slumber well released — Great and most glorious in the land of light, — The land of spirits — throned among the kings, Whose virtues, equal to their task of might, Were only equalled by their sufferings! February 1, 1820. SONNET TO ROBERT SOUTHEY, ESQ. POET LAUREATE. Thou! of the wild and wonderous Song! of her Gallia's prophetic Maid — of Thalaba — Of Madoc — and the Goth! — Great Reveller Both in our hearth's sweet charities, and, ah! Man's vainest mysteries, sublime and far, The superstitions stricken sinners fear. Prolific Mind — spontaneous Muse — bright Star, In the pure Heaven of Verse benign and clear! Friend of the Dead! who pierced each scattered scroll, Preserving to all time the Poet's name, Of that young, resolute, weak, yet ardent soul, Which burnt out its own fire, and went in flame To be renewed above the dulcet pole — Friend of the Dead! — and this shall be thy fame.</field>
