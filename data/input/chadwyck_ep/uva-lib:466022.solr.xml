      <field name="fulltext">DAISY'S THIMBLE. I O dear small thimble Which fingers nimble Have used so daintily, scores of times, I hold you lightly, Shining so brightly, And think of your wearer in far new climes, When these same fingers O'er which love lingers, Will turn the pages no more of my rhymes. II These hands, here growing Like blossoms blowing, So white and tender, so soft and still, Youth's golden flowers In life's first hours, In meadow and coppice, by stream and rill, Have gathered: now never For ever, for ever, Our English roses their touch will thrill. III Good-bye, good-bye to you, My verses sigh to you, O dainty finger that wearest the shell,â The silver agile Dear thimble fragile Whose daily glitter I know so well; See how I take you For her sweet sake, you Small silver token, which unseen fell. IV Fell from her finger, Fated to linger Henceforth for ever in secret lair; Yea, when the owner, Unconscious donor, Is breathing the arid and Eastern air, Thou shalt be sign to me, Breathe a soft line to me, Memory of hours and flowers that were. V The fingers that used thee, Daintily bruised thee With soft sweet pressure of snow-white tips, Will no more glitter Amid the litter, The spangled litter of work-room snipsâ They soon the roses That Love discloses Must gather, growing as grow the lips. VI The sacred flowers Of Love's deep bowers They soon shall gather, those fingers dear; They pass away from us, A sun-sweet ray from us, To lands where suns strike rapid and sheer; They leave us, grieve us, Sadden, bereave us, Just at the dawn of the rosebud year. VII O dawning rosebud, Whiter than snows bud, Pass forth and gladden the strange far land; Leave our pale bowers And storm-swept flowers Behind, and gather in white quick hand The fairy legions Of blossoms in regions Unknown, untrodden, a stranger strand. VIII Thine hands have lingered, Plucked and have fingered English hair-bells, whose stems were slight; English roses And hedge-side posies Which laughed, upgazing with laughing might Into the fairer Eyes, bluer and rarer, Which pierced the blossoms like star-rays bright. IX These were the flowers Of tender hours Of girlhood, laughing as laughed the maid:â These were the first days, Free from love's thirst days, Soft happy moments while love delayed His ardent coming, Nor yet the humming Of his swift wings over the young winds strayed. X This was the May-time Of growth and of playtime, The season wherein the plumes were shaped That, snow-white pinions, In new dominions, Snow-white, or lovely and rainbow-draped, Shall soon remind us That time did blind us While one more blossom its sheath escaped. XI A blossom growing Without our knowing, To shine, full-petalled, in other fields; To gleam, bright-golden, Not in the olden Sad land which yearly its tribute yields To India's younger Yearning and hunger, A rose to blazon the flag she wields. XII If ever returning, The full rose, burning, Bright, full-grown, beautiful, lights our shore, What will it say to us, Soft yea or nay to us; Will it be mindful of days before? Will it forget them, Leave or regret them, Will there be one look soft as of yore? XIII Will there be one look, Star-look or sun-look, Sweet as the smiles were, tender of old, A soft smile starry For hope to carry Upward in arms that clasp it and fold The dear look beaming, Lightening and gleaming, In from our chill land's vapour and cold? XIV If ever again to us, Thrice welcome then to us, The rose returneth, ah! shall we know The same shape older, The curve of shoulder, The innocent young lips? Will there be glow Of recognition, O rosebud visionâ Ah, who can tell us?âtime's waves fast flow. XV Yea, faster even Than ripples in heaven Of love's fair ocean, love's moonlit streams; Fierce time advances With surge-white lances, Across life's furrows his huge wave gleams; His ponderous massive Charge, stubborn and passive, Bears force more cogent than love's frail dreams. XVI So rose returning With petals burning Clear-shaped, love-reddened, across the foam, We may not know thee, May pass, forego thee; A foreign blossom not formed at home Thou then may'st seem to us, A distant dream to us, No straight stalk fashioned in English loam. XVII So it may be then! What shall we see then? The English Daisyâor some strange stem With new grafts clinging Not of our bringing, And our hands having no part in them? Nor our hearts knowing The weird buds growing, Whose garish colours our eyes contemn. XVIII O Daisy simple, With sweet smile-dimple, Oh, keep thine eyes on thine English name:â Be ever Daisy Through Indian hazy Strange summers when heaven one widelit flame Burns fierce above thee; So shall we love thee Though ceasing more of thy life to claim. XIX Be English rosebud, Through fierce sky glows, bud Above thee, paling thy tender bloom; White, white for ever, In soul changed never, But deepening only in pure perfume:â Lifted by passion In sweet true fashion, As years flit by thee, and swift consume. XX And thou, small token, Shapely, unbroken, I'll keep thee by me till she returns, In sign that, moulding To woman, but holding In safe sweet keeping, Love o'er her yearns; I kiss the thimble, Whose bright shield nimble From nimble fingers the needle spurns. TO THE UNIVERSE GOD. I O God who broodest o'er the ocean spaces, And shinest in the gold-winged glimmering cars Wherein night's steeds are yoked for heaven-high races,â Splendid amid the cream-white hosts of stars, Divine and fragrant in all flowery places, Awful where red-lipped War his pale bride chases, Glory his white-lipped bride Through battle's foaming tide,â Great God serene amid the bloodless faces Of all the outstretched dead, And golden on the head That shines with girlish golden hair and graces Some half-grown rosebud girl,â And foam-white in the curl Of waves that scour the sand with ravenous paces,â Oh lift the yearning world, swift day by day, With sweet victorious pulse along its stedfast way! II Thou art in heaven and in the utter deep Of fiery flame-winged hell, and in the light Of suns and moons and in the spotless sleep Of children,âin their glances clear and bright: Thou art in the golden corn the reapers reap, And in the thundering cataracts that leap Along the shaking rocks; Thou art in the snow-white flocks And in the April tender buds that peep With laughter through the panes; Thou art in the blood-red stains Of crime, and in all daring deeds that keep Earth's tidal waters pure; And through sin's groves obscure Thou passest as a breeze with wings that weep,â In all the vales of earth and in the sky Thy white strange glory, God, we, worshipping, descry. III But, most of all, thou shinest in the fair Splendour of man and in the tender heart Of woman, and in love's rose-gladdened air: All loveless souls thou piercest with thy dart, Through passionless pale flesh thine arrows tear, And cowardly souls thou tanglest in a snare,â Thou scourgest them until Thou hast thy final will, Yea, till the fruits of flower-sweet love they bear; Thou art within the rose Of love when first it glows, A joy, a deep delight, a wonder rare; Thou art within the bloom Of passion, a perfume That brings the utter peace of heaven's hope there; Thou hast thy crown eternal in the power Whereby all budding loves burst into burning flower. THE LAST FAREWELL. Ten years ago the sweet sea shone supreme With glow and splendour of love's early dream; Passion touched every wave with magic gleam. The white waves, laughing, foamed anear our feet; The summer afternoons, 'mid flowers, were sweet; We wandered through the woods, the golden wheat. Now where art thou? And, sweetheart, where am I? Where are the sunsets of that early sky? Love's silver streams have vanished; they are dry. Thou hast chosenâkeep to itâthy fitting part, And given away thy spirit, and thy heart; My thought no longer lingers where thou art. Lo! our great rose of love I take in hand, And, glancing once back, towards the fair lost land, I let thy face with its sweet breath be fanned. Once more, once more; then towards a shoreless sea, And mountains where thou mayest not follow me, I pass; God's world is wide; we both are free. Or rather free thou art not! thou art bound, Fettered by this world's anklets to its ground; Thou hast lost thy wreath; thy chaplets are unwound. If thou art gone, all roses are not dead; The fair white lily lifts, for thee, its head; Thy voice is hushed; the May-winds speak instead. Still, though not round thy feet, the grasses blow, The woods, the sea-side hanging woods we know, Watch the fern-fronds unfasten, row by row. If thou art dead, the old live waves are white; The old moon glimmers o'er the old tracks at night; The same sun climbs the flashing midday height. Thy ghost, thy phantom, fleeteth into air; And, where it was, this summer rose is fair, Sweet with the smell still of thy waving hair. Thou hast not strength to face the fiery morn; I leave thee; not with anger, not with scorn; As twilight, when the golden day is born. Yea, thou art twilight; glimmer with thy face Once more upon my path, then let the race Begin for me that leads to love's embrace. To love's embrace; but, lost love, not to thee; Unto mine heart âLong-bound heart, thou art free,â I say; âunfettered, chainless as the sea.â Farewell, farewell; along the winds my cry Sounds, like the sea's wail when the storm is high, When the pent sea-shriek mixes with the sky. Farewell, farewell; no kiss, nor grasp of hand; Only one look from seaward towards the land; Thou, blind, art dead; God lives to understand. May 15, 1879. EARLY POEMS. (Written in 1870.) I. AN EARTH-SONG. I That I could sing the splendour, And some account could render Of all the joys of living like a man upon the earth; The wonder of the daytime, The greenery of May-time, The mystery of death-time, the mystery of birth! II That I could pierce the ether, The earthâand plunge beneath her Wide-rolling prairie-panoply of surface-smiles and flowers; And get me to the centre, And find the fires that rent her Cliffs and chasms and mountain-tops, the live volcanic powers! III Returning to things human, I'd sing of man and woman, And all the life of love-time, the glory of the land; How man is handed over, A child become a lover, From woman unto woman, from tender hand to hand. IV Man leaves at last his mother, And findeth in another A wondrous new development of love that ceaseth never; More wonderful than dreams were, Fulfilled with fairyland, fair Fruition of the fancy-realm that seemed a myth for ever. V And as he sits a-dreaming, Along his brain is streaming A river of recollection that linketh old and new; He sees the realization Of childhood's admiration Of doughty deeds of heroes, of the beautiful and true. VI How clearly he remembers By stirring up the embers Of memory, how Woman first appeared in childish dreams; A goddess of the ether Who smiled on men beneath her, All garmented in sunset, and bright with burning beams. VII Calm, crowned, an earthly centre, Her robes without a rent, her Presence an embodiment of all we fancied fair; With eyes of wondrous seeming, With tenderness all gleaming, And a light upon her raiment, and a glory in her hair. VIII One hardly likes to think of it, Again in dreams to drink of it, A draught of joy so wonderful, a picture passing pure; And yet, not all ungrateful, We are glad that in the hateful Dark lanes of later life a ray of light can still endure. IX A memory of the vision, The dream, the intuition, The God-vouchsafed glimpses of the life that ought to be; Ah me! the early river, The flakes of light that quiver Across its course miles upward from the weary weary sea! X It leaps along the sandbanks And laughs atween the fern-ranks, With splashing and with dashing, and with sounds of happy glee; It has not seen the town yet, The grief is further down yet, The child is not the model of the man that is to be. XI Then come the town-pollutions: An Ã¦on of ablutions Shall not restore the freshness of the stream above the town; The Arve has joined the Rhone now, With tardiness of flow now, And weightier wave of water it for ever runneth down. XII On towards the sea though! Little does the stream know All the wealth of wonderment awaiting it in death; Dreams that it shall find there All before it found fair, Purity of raiment, and a joy that takes the breath. XIII Fullest restoration To rightful rank and station; Perfected development of all the dreams of youth; Even for him a May-queen, Fair, with eyes of grey-green, And bloom of black-brown tresses, and the whiteness of the truth. Good Friday, 1870. II. A BRIDAL-CHANT. Hexameters. Over the hills and far away, right into the home of the summer, Hand in hand together they go, towards the region of sunset; She, fair as a daughter of Eve; he, bright as a beam of Apollo, Straight, upright as a rod, not bent and bowed together, Like to the careworn men who within this fortunate island Toil and moil for a crust, and exist, and dream they are living. Fair as the sons of Greece who beneath the unspeakable ether Wrought, and fought with the gods, the givers of might to mortals, Givers of might and of manhood, and lust of doing and daring; Givers of strength in the struggle, and endless perseverance. Fair as Psyche is fair, bright, beautiful, gift of the goddess (She who rewards the brave with ecstasy not to be uttered), Sweet as Venus herself, was the Bride who blossomed before him. III. THE EMIGRANT'S SONG. Hark to the dashing of the deep blue sea As the sides of the boat are gleaming Through deep-drawn furrows of the lands that are free, With a foam-line after us streaming! Life before us, and room to expand! Let us steer for the home of the sunset, Let us make for the shores of an infinite land And smile at the swift waves' onset. Let us cast from off us the chains of the old And look to a life that is new; As the creeds of the past wax fainter and cold, Clear rises a creed that is true. We shall soon be free; far out of the reach Of the priests, and the tales of tradition; Fear not: we shall ground on a gravelly beach, And arrive at a rightful condition. Let us leave the churches that clamour and cry, And put the books on the shelves; Come, men, my brothers, at least we will try To find us a faith for ourselves! We are leaving lands where respectable saints Look down on the poor and the old; Where Nature is scorned, and humanity faints, And women are bought and sold. Where priests shriek shouts, and condemn their betters, While women fall faint, and fade before them, Believing in lies, believing in fetters, And not in the truth of the Spirit that bore them. The Spirit that lords it over the sea, Shines in the sunshine, walks in the wind, Sounds in the life of the leaves of a tree, Kisses the eyes of a soul that has sinned. ClothÃ¨d upon with the might of the thunder And brighter than brightness of lightning rays; Fulfilled with lifeâdividing asunder The soul and the body, the nights and days. The Spirit that breathes in the infinite ether, And clothes the night with a mantle of stars; All-gracious; smiling on mortals beneath her; Spirit of peace-time, Spirit of wars. Strong to rejoice in the roar of the battle, Strong to inspire the might of a man Calm in the midst of its thunderous rattle, Leaping alert in the heart of the van. Holding the threads of the life of the nations, Songs of the seasons, tides of the sea; Dealing rewards and condemnations, Fashioning, causing to cease to be. Bringer of birth-time, worker of wonder, Daily developing life in the earth; Maker of heat, light, forger of thunder, Seasons of sadness, hours of mirth. Maker of hours of work and of playtime, And above all things, Author of loveâ Love the incarnate spirit of May-time, Spirit that broods with the wings of a dove. Love that slayeth and love that healeth, With the power of life and death in his wings; Love with the ice-cold power that congealeth, And love the looser of frozen strings. Sweet love that gladdens with gleams of the spring-time, And scent of flowers, and singing of birds; And leaves that re-echo the lilt of the windrhyme, And laughter, and musical lowing of herds. Such is the Spirit that fools are blaspheming, Preaching of darkness, horrors of hell, Torturing souls who are timidly dreaming That if a God reigneth it must be well. Well for the good men, well for the sinners, Well for the priests, whose power shall fall; Well for the saints and the feeble beginners; Some way or other, well for us all. IV. THE DEAD MEN'S SONG. I Praise we death Who stays our breath And sends us rest from pain; Slay we life With edge of knife And hurl him back again. II Praise the tomb, The utmost gloom Of garments graveyards hold; The dead men's lyre, And flames of fire From mouth of skeleton rolled. III Praise the dance Of feet that prance Upon the ball-room floor Deep down below, Where worm-buds grow, And light's alive no more. IV Slay we love, The feeble dove, And smear her wings with clay! Here below We dead men know Her notâthe beetles play. V And mosses damp, And clink of clamp, And spiders' webs entwined In hair of ours, In woven bowers, Are dear to dead men's mind. V Half-eaten eyes With no surprise We see: that sort of thing Is common here; Whole eyes are dear; This is the song we sing. V. THE WIFE'S RETURN. Deary me, what a dirty room! Quick, my husband, bring me a broom, And let me sweep away the gloom That reigns when I'm not here. This is the way you treat the place When I, your wife, no longer grace This home of ours with the light of my faceâ 'Tis enough to move a tear! Get you gone, and let me alone; Out of the way; and when you're flown I'll sweep it clean as if 'twere mownâ You go and fetch the beer. The only thing, I often think, That the men are fit for is to drink Or empty soap-suds into the sink: I'm never away but I fear; Fear for the garden most of all, Dream of the pigs, and hear them squall, And see the children playing at ball On the flower-beds, far and near. See the potatoes going to rot, The peas in pieces, and what not, The cabbages all a mouldy lot, And never a currant clear. Never you mindâI'm home again, And that's the chief thing; only when Next time I go, be sure that then You manage better, dear. VI. GOOD-NIGHT. Good-night, good-night! Till dawn of day May soft sleep stay By you, I pray; Till breaks the light; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! The day was glad When you I had In sight, but sad Is now my plight; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! The darkness teems With you: in dreams I hunt the gleams Of tresses bright; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! Till to-morrow Sorrowâsorrow: Then we borrow Wings for flight; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! I think of you, My hero true, The long night through; Till shines the light; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! To-morrow, sweet, Again we meet, And gone the feet Of evil plight; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! I feel your hand, I see you stand In dim dream-land, In garments bright; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! Yours am I, sweet, Slow to sigh, sweet, Swift to fly, sweet, Strong for flight; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! The last adieu: To-morrow's dew Will fall on two, On love alight; Good-nightâgood-night. Good-night, good-night! The last kiss blown, The last look flown, From off his throne Must love alight; My ownâgood-night. VII. BEYOND THE YEARS! Beyond the years there lies a compensation For all this heaped-up mountainous pile of woe, This Alpine elevation of the snow Of sorrow, this most piteous tribulation,â These oceans filled at founts of women's tears; For all, I tell you, waiteth compensation Beyond the years! For all the agony, and heart-sick groaning, And agitation of uplifted hands That seek to pull God down from where He stands And force His silent eyes to see the moaning, To listen to the heaving of the lands, There waiteth somewhere, somehow, compensation; A flower expands Of hope that beckoneth weary footsteps forward Towards a possibility of life, A possible cessation of the strife, A possible approach of earth's ship shoreward: As watcheth for a husband's step a wife, Our eyes are strained towards this compensation For ceaseless planetary tribulation, This cutting of the cord of our damnation With keen-edged knife. TO A LILY. SUMMER LOVE. BRUISED BLOSSOMS. My love wentâflinging from her mantle fast Along the dusty and forsaken road Strange flowers and fruits that bloomed and shone and glowed, Re-lighting the pale tapers of the past, Making the wilderness a temple vast; And a sweet woman, slighter but as fair, Went, gathering bruised blossoms in her hair, And round about their stems her veil she cast. And unto me she brought the flowers and fruits, Weeping, and with soft pity in her eyes, And laid her tender hand on severed roots; And if a bud or any petal lies Broken, she wailethâand the sundered shoots To re-establish in green bloom she tries. THE LILY AND THE ROSE. A lily with the fragrance of my rose Mingled strange fleeting odours passing sweet, And in the imprint of that flower's feet Left novel tints and subtle signs of snows; Now in my heart a double blossom blows, And all my soul is ravished by the heat Of summer twice inflamed, and seems to beat Responsive as the ascending season grows. For first the rose with crimson scent delayed The full outpouring of the lily's breath, And faint her presence was and pale as death, And timidly she lingered in the shade; But now I kiss with valour every braid, And yearn ecstatic o'er each word she saith. THE BATTLE OF FLOWERS. Two flowers struggled hard within my soul, The spirits of a lily and a roseâ And first on high the crimson odour grows, And next a snow-white vapour seems to roll The gates of sound asunder, and control My heart till song's liquescence overflows; So each sweet flower alternate rules and blows, Each in a variously fragrant stole. But lo! one morning when I woke I saw Myself adorned in smooth delicious whiteâ And, wondering at the unaccustomed sight Of such a body made devoid of flaw, Perceived myself with deep unuttered awe Clothed in the lily's plumes from left to right. CRIMSON AND MANY FLOWERS. âI loved another blossom,â so I saidâ âAnd she was somewhat fairer, sweet, than you;â The maiden answered not, but closer drew The tender-shielding bounty of her head, And in that moment lo! one love was dead And golden wings proclaimed a goddess new, And as her pinions fluttered into view The sun was risen turbulent and redâ The vehement approach of a new day That shall surpass the former, and outshine With a supreme unparalleled display Those weeping misty seasons that were mine, And round about my rugged brows shall twine Crimson and many flowers for thorns and grey. A WOMAN'S BLOOM. âMy heart hath suffered, sweet one:â But she brought The nearer that down-bending, gracious head, And, though no word articulate was said, That tender token hath a marvel wrought, A miracle of healing beyond thoughtâ For on a lonely grave a rose was red That moment, and a crimson heart that bled Was stanched and white, and ceased to suffer aught:â And over me there flowed a wealth of hair, And that strange endless unforeseen perfume Was subtle and abundant in the airâ The fire that scorches but doth not consume, The sweet outpouring of a woman's bloom, Unutterably wonderful and fair. PARTING. THOSE SUMMER NIGHTS. When we were happy in those summer nights, Making great London but a soft green wood As each beside the other silent stood, Breathing a mutual nosegay of delights, We were not conscious of love's present heightsâ But now, possession being cold and thin, With no sweet golden lovers' gate to win, We recognise and eulogise love's rights. âAh! that was sweetââso each may sob and sayâ âThat evening when glad August in the trees And shrubs made such a tender lovers' breeze:â For, visible from an October grey, The past is as a gold transfigured day, The present as the sapless nights that freeze. SWEET FANCY'S HAND. It is sweet fancy's hand that crowns the pastâ For, when we were together, you and I, The ground was dull and motionless and dry, Across it a wan veil of colour cast; Now, swept by my imagination's blast, It glitters like a countless summer sky, And round about our feet the flowers fly, And wings of birds succeed each other fast. For every step we took I see a flower Bloom in the dreary desert of the squares,â The arid pasture of our London airs Is even as a sweet rose-planted bower, And every spot we lingered in an hour An endless flood of vegetation bears. A FAR-OFF HILL. Ah, sweet, now you are gone, I see the days We spent together, colourless before, Flame with triumphant lustre more and more, Till every street we threaded is a blaze Of splendour, and the sad dust-stricken ways Shine as a moon-enamoured silver shore; My fancy brings each tone of yours of yore, And every smile, into my weeping gaze. It always is so: as a sun-kissed hill Shines in the distance, girt about with fear And mystery, whose beauty could not fill The over-daring eye when we were near, So gleams a far-off passion,âsoft and still And awful, and unutterably clear. WITH WHITER PLUMES. I loved a lily: The sweet flower was near, And, bearing petals less majestic far, Shone as a lesser individual star, Made by a sweet proximity as dear As the imperial rose,âand white and clear The lily shone; but when the flower was full, Another hand had interfered to pull The petals,âan intruder's foot was here. And so I miss my lily and my rose, Fated to love for ever but to find No flower for me her tenderest depths disclose; Yet bear I some triumphant mirth of mind, In that the lily kissed me, and hath shined Because of me with whiter plumes of snows. LOVE AND HONOUR. I stood before a grave,âand honour said, âHeap loudly on the corpse that lies therein Dust and departureâthat the soul may win The eternal halo of a passion dead, And round about her lips for roses red Twine lilies pale as her own life hath been; And seize thine harp, sad singer, and begin Some low-voiced tune to tears and yearning wed.â But love said, âRather let the corpse awake! And let sweet lips for roses be the charm To bring towards an unhesitating arm The tender limbs and soft desires that shake And flutter as a lily for thy sakeâ Even as a lily loud in her alarm.â THE MAGIC OF MEMORY. I. When you were with me, sweet, I could not lead Your presence through the corridors of rhyme: But you are smitten by the snows of time, And by swift disappointment's sword I bleed, And, having chosen an unselfish creed, In every flowery avenue of mind A gracious footprint of my love's I find, And sonnets spring by thousands out of seed! Before I lost you, I was silent,ânow That I have given you into other hands, The gardens of my brain are tuneful lands, And linnets twitter round about my brow, And nightingales are loud on every bough, And thrushes chant your praise in laughing bands. II. The roads we trod together, gleam and shine,â Grey, cold, and sour, and flint-bedecked before,â But now the moon of fancy on the shore Of bitter absence sheds a silver line, And, as the gossamer-woven webs combine To elude our present overpowering tread, But flame in sweet prismatic green and red And gold and fairy lacework clean and fine When distance has transfigured the broad fieldâ So every stone we touched in this dull town, Then garbed in ordinary dust and brown, A golden flash of colour seems to yield, And shines like some anointed luscious shield, Under the bitter fire of memory's frown. WINTER LOVE. THIS AFTERNOON. This afternoon I go to meet my love,â And, through the earlier moments of the day, My pulses like swift throbbing surges play, Mixed with the soft respiring of a dove, And pinions beat the azure cliffs above And frolic in and out each windy bayâ I triumph; for she hath not answered âNay;â I hold her written word in sign thereof. Ah, love! 'tis but a wintry afternoon, Yet will we make it as a summer sleep Winged with strange odours passing soft and deepâ A clear and passionate crimson-hooded swoon: And though our ruddy heaven be over soon, It leaves a rose for either heart to keep. A SUN-GOD. Soon thou shalt lay thy tender hands on me And the strong force of passion shall ignite, Struck as a sudden comet into light By the inviting flame of love I see Bloom as a crimson mantle over theeâ Even as the snows below the hills are white, But next the Alpine sun shine red and bright, Rosy for miles upon the mountain-knee. Yea, thou shalt change me from a quiet star, Following the universal rounded road, Desiring thee in silence from afar, Into a sun-god,âbearing the white load Of thy sweet misty body in a car Of flame towards some desirable abode. A TALISMAN. I have not seen you,âand the days have been But as a meagre and remorseful time, The likeness of some frozen blue-clad clime, Some destitute abode of tears and sin; But summer is upon us, and we win The roses and the dreams of mute delight That clothe the sweet limbs of a summer night, And hem the fragrant arms of summer in. Summer is as a fragrant rose-plumed bird, Young, and delirious with its own desire; Winter is as a worn-out aged fireâ But somewhere of a talisman I heard That hath the magic potency to gird Roses about each wintry wan-built briar. LOVE'S CRUELTY. Sweet, every meeting-time may be our last! We stand upon time's beach, and, after, one May launch a boat with cunning keel to run Against the sidelong pressure of the blast, With curved resistance of a reedlike mast, Into the hollows of the western sunâ Time finished, red eternity begun, Our love may be but as a rosebud past, Crying in some disastrous nook of garden After the heels of summer, who declares, Invincible and destitute of pardon, His lips are languid for Australian airs,â And, with love's endless cruelty, prepares The alternate hemisphere to inflame and harden. I SEND A SONG. This afternoon I am to meet you, sweet. The torrents of my longing overflow, As from white clouds descending streams of snow Cover with feathery flakes our halting feet: I send a song in front of me to meet The soft advancing rosebud-lips I know So truly, that I think I see them grow With increase soft and odorous and fleet. Song! lay upon her lips my panting soul Already in advance of this slow clock, That it may sway from side to side, and rock Even as a flower floating in a bowl Upon those fragrant billowy tides, the whole Of which shall overwhelm me when I knock. AND SHALL I SEE YOU? And shall I see you, sweet, and are you still Soft and as white and gentle as before? And doth the moon still beam along the shore With tender eyes and yellow rays that thrill The pebbles and the yearning foam, and spill Their passionate effulgence more and more? Sweet, thou shalt lay thine hand upon the sore Heart-spot of parting, and thine eyes shall fill The cup of my strong being till it yearns And trembles into air and overflows: Even as the sun's imperious mandate turns The bending face and body of a rose Upwardâtill every petal doth unclose, Blushing, and every vein and fibre burns. WHERE THOU ART, SWEET. Where thou art, sweet, it matters not to know Whether sweet summer's sceptre reigns supreme, For thou art girded with a luscious dream That darts a rosy radiance over snow, As thou dost tread triumphant to and fro,â The light wherewith thy winged feet do teem; Where they have trodden, the amorous grasses seem To blossom into flame and overflow, As at the advent of twin goddesses; And, when thy hand is laid upon my neck, It is even as a shower divine to bless The solemn marble, cleansed from every fleck By the descending silvery flames that check The thunders of sin's turbulent distress. EVEN AS THE DOVE. Even as the dove went, errant from the ark, Speeding with hopeful pinions through the deep To analyse the awful void, and peep If anywhere a green and living spark Her eyes of bright intelligence might markâ Fly, fragrant-winged song, towards my love, Dividing with the white breast of a dove The inanimate resistance of the dark. Seek her, and hover over her in spite Of the dark-panoplied adulterous storm, And seize from off her lips a rosebud white, Tender and irreproachable and warm,â And hasten with that soft inviolate form Through the wild ebbing armies of the night. 1871. ODE TO ENGLAND. STROPHE I. At length the lands arise With heaven-seeking eyes; No more they search the past, And backward glances cast Towards fields of Galilee And that blue inland sea: But every land adores The God of its own shores, The Deity of its hills, The Spirit of its rills, Redeemer of its plains, Who o'er its cities reigns Cleansing each soul from stains. STROPHE II. Lift up your eyes towards the morning brightness, Dwell no more 'mid the past like sons of slaves: Lo! even here shines the exceeding whiteness Of Venus 'mid the surging crowns of waves, And Jesus rises from ten thousand graves. The heroes of high history of each nation Speak in the burning records of the race; Through wrongs, through woes, through speechless tribulation, They sought the living God's great changeless face And now they shine star-saviours in each place. Bright are their eyes and deathless is their glory; Lift up your eyes to their eyes all ye lands! Yea, every nation, listen to the story Of those who moulded it with iron hands, And loosed its dim primeval swaddling-bands. STROPHE III. O England, dwell no longer 'Mid shows of things, and dreams: Rise, for thou art the stronger! Thy sunrise o'er thee beams And round about thee streams. Stronger thou art and fairer Than lands thou hast obeyed: Thine azure heavens are rarer; Why art thou thus afraid? Why lingerest in the shade? Hast thou no spirits diviner Than Jesus, Moses, Paul? Art thou content with minor Slow-sandalled feet that crawl, Not flyâthat stumble, fall? Hast thou no hearts that carry A yearning force supreme? Must thou for ever tarry, Possessed by some pale dream, While past thee nations stream? Rise! greater than the immortal Spirits of Greece and Rome Thou hast within thy portal: Within the ring of foam That girds thine island-home. STROPHE IV. England! bring thou blossoms from all thy hills; Wreathe thou tender lilies from sides of rills Golden, flowing through vales that plenty fills. Golden crowns of the corn, and crowns of red Autumn leaves for the new God's kingly head Bring thou; he needs a wreath, for his wreaths are dead. Dead are the Jewish wreaths, and the flowers of Rome: Now God plunges his feet deep in the English foam, Seeking this land for rest, craving a Western home. Wilt thou hound him away, shriek him away from thee? Hurl him wandering forth over the barren sea? Build him a temple rather, marble in purity. Let God rest and dream, hidden in thy deep meads, Hidden and wreathed in flowers, soothing the brow that bleeds Yet from the spears and thorns, finding delight he needs. Here is a land for a God; fair in body and soul. England, give to thy God body and heart,âthy whole Measureless splendid might, as of tides that round thee roll. STROPHE V. Lo! in tender accents, hark! the high God speaks; England, let his message flush thy languid cheeks! Give to him the great gift that his longing seeks. Give to him thy children, fair and strong and free, Pure and brave and happy, splendid flowers of thee, Give to him thy manhood, thy maturity. âWeary am I,â God saith, âof the pallid past; Brace me, wind of England, after burning blast O' the arid Eastern deserts, where my soul was cast. âNow I turn me Northward: shall I find a race Fit to stand before me, unabashed of face? Shall I find in England home and dwelling-place?â ANTISTROPHE I. Doth England hear and turn With longing eyes that yearn And sparkle at the voice Of Deity, and rejoice? Or doth she, cowed and pale, Hidden beneath the veil Of her own feebleness, Tremble at the stress And force of fiery sound That girdled her around When the high God spoke, And thunderlike he broke The silence, and she woke. ANTISTROPHE II. Wilt thou with ferns and flowers from deep dim valleys Weave a divine sweet frontlet for thy king, O England; now thy soul his trumpet rallies, What wilt thou in thine arms, O England, bring? Wherewith wilt thou the eternal forehead ring? The bay-leaves wilt thou bind of all thy singers Around the eternal forehead broad and white, Touching with womanly and reverent fingers The brow, the eyes of marvellous sweet light: Then wilt thou bring rose-crowns of lovers bright? Oh, most of all, be thine own self, and ring him With thine own strengthened and victorious soul: This chiefest of all gifts, O England, bring him! Mingle in love's clear sacrificial bowl The wine of thine own heart made flawless, whole. ANTISTROPHE III. Let love at length its mission In thine own home fulfil: Let love's sweet utmost vision Of perfect soul and will All devious passions still. Let love at length be chainless; So shall love be supreme, Then for the first time stainless, A golden sunrise-gleam Upon a golden stream. Pour through thine own dear meadows, England, one burst of song, Scattering pain's shadows And all the black-plumed throng Of sorrows, strange and strong. Meet, utterly white, fearless, The God who for thee pines: Glad, sighless, pangless, tearless, Casting aside the signs Of suffering he divines. Thine immemorial sorrow He knoweth, and shall slay: Lo! crimson dawns the morrow Of many a mournful day Through centuries grim and grey. ANTISTROPHE IV. Not the dreams of the past, of the days of old, God needs: not strange dreams of the walls of gold In heaven and jewels and pearls and treasure untold. Not these things; but the breath of the English air And blossoms of spring from dells where ferns are fair And jewels of star-white petals than pearls more rare. And jewels of glances bright and tender and grey Better to God now, dearer, than star-like ray Of glances piercing the cloudless Eastern day. And weapons of strong men's arms from the Northern plains Whereover the future's sun, now rising, reigns; Rich armour of fearless countless hearts for his fanes. These and the sound of our seas by day by night, The limitless organ-peal of breakers white Thrilling the new-found heart of God with might. And the utter strength of the soul: this God requires; And all the worship and music of English lyres And worship of limitless sea-like hearts he desires. ANTISTROPHE V. Lo! with brave sweet accents England turns to thee Great God of the past world, king now of the sea Girding her white cliffs, lord of futurity. âTake my thousand meadows; take each hill and plain;â So saith England: âover free glad spirits reign; Rule till as my seas are, souls are clear of stain. âPour thy kingly presence through the throbbing land: Sons of God by thousands shall before thee stand Holding daughters of thee by the white, white hand. âSons of God and daughters, saviours, shalt thou find In the race thou choosest; leaders of mankind, Voiced as are the surges, winged as is the wind.â EPODE. Beyond the faintest region of stars or skies Lo! England pierces the future with sunbright eyes. Great spirits beyond the spirits who crowned the past Shall lift the future towards summits unreached and vast. Already the sound of their feet at the doors is heard And the wide land shakes and quakes at their loud first word. Christ-men, Christ-women, whose feet at the bright doors stand Shall lift and redeem and heal and deliver the land. The God in their eyes shall pierce through the lessening gloom And their splendour of heart shall be treasure and flame and perfume. And the places waste shall blossom, the wild ways sing At the message of peace and redemption and joy they bring. These England bearing thou shalt stand forth as a queen And rule the future, triumphant and great of mien. And God in thy waves and upon thy hills shall sound And in women's souls and in men's with God's kiss crowned. TO THEE, SWEET. The music of thy song, sweet, Has sounded through the night: Its accents pure and strong, sweet, Its fervour calm and bright, Have lifted me along, sweet, Have brought God's heaven in sight. I rested on the sound, sweet, With happy eyes closed fast: Its tender magic bound, sweet, My soul; its glory cast A golden veil around, sweet,â It changed the weary past. I hear the song by night, sweet, I hear it in the day: At dawn of soft-grey light, sweet, It shines upon my way; Ever its flame in sight, sweet, Leads, like some heaven-sent ray. Oh, I will try, my own sweet, To be to thee the flower Thou singest of; my tone, sweet, With woman's tender power Shall sootheâthou shalt be shown, sweet, Love's deepest rose-hung bower! And in that bower of joy, sweet, Thy sorrows kissed away, Shall pain not nor annoy, sweet; My heart in thine shall stay: Love's pleasure shall not cloy, sweet, Nor bloom of love decay. I dreamed a tender dream, sweet,â I tell it to thee here; But the pure, gracious theme, sweet, Is only for thine ear: It was a sunrise-gleam, sweet, Beautiful, noble, clear. I dreamed I came to thee, sweet,â All barriers slipped away: All raiment fell from me, sweet, I was as white as day; I laughed in utter glee, sweet, More glad than I can say! All raiment earthly melted Away in that fair dream: Alone with beauty belted, O lover, I did seem! I stood by thee and felt it Sweet, sweet,âa heaven-gleam! Naked I stood for thee, sweet,â Divinely white and pure: God clothed with passion me, sweet; But all that could obscure And hinder soft love, He, sweet, Stripped with a mandate sure. So all my beauty came, sweet,â Is it so much indeed? About thee like a flame, sweet, Thy blossom, yea thy meed; I had no thought of shame, sweet, I knew what love decreed. I passed into thy form, sweet, Just like a soft, soft breeze, A dear leaf-shaking storm, sweet, That laughs amid the trees: White, tender, loving, warm, sweet,â White as the white, white seas. I rushed into thine arms, sweet, I rushed into thy soul: Dead was each fear that harms, sweet, I saw love's sacred whole Revealed: now nought alarms, sweet,â I've read love's deepest scroll. I passed with perfect peace, sweet, Into a life quite new: From bondage to release, sweet, A freedom won by you: Past pangs and sorrows cease, sweet,â I sing, glad in the blue. I sing for very gladness, I, who was once afraid: I, who once in deep sadness Sat, as in dark damp glade; I, who have met grim madness, And longed to sip night-shade. I sing; for thou hast won me, Sweet lover, poet, king: Thy loving soul hath spun me Soft wedding-raiment; ring Of genius given, and done me Proud honour; so I sing. I come to thee in dreaming, I come in waking thought: When fancies swift are streaming Throughout me, clasped and caught In golden network gleaming, I come: such dreams I've brought! I come on earth; in heaven, Sweet love, I'll come the more: When earth's worn garb is riven And on the eternal shore Life's bark is tossed and driven, My love at last I'll pour In utter perfect power, sweet, Upon thee! thou shalt know What pleasure love can shower, sweet, What woman's hand can throw Of magic round her bower, sweetâ How woman's heart can glow! I'll come to thee at last, sweet, And be thy very queen; A whisper on the blast, sweet, A crown of starry sheen: I'll give thee all my past, sweet, Its storms, its hours serene. I'll give thee the old loves, sweet, Such as the old loves were! Lead thee through former groves, sweet, Wherein, not all unfair, The former singing doves, sweet, Sang,âin the youthful air. I'll give thee all the wonder Of sweet, sweet youthful days: Delight at wild stern thunder, Joy in the lightning-blaze; The past, the now, the yonder, In one glad wreath I raise. I come to thee a girl, sweet, Long ere my mother died, And bring thee a pale curl, sweet, Cut when I left her side: Better than gold or pearl, sweet,â A gift of me thy bride! The great strange billows hoary I saw by childhood's seas I bring thee, and the glory Of myriad forest trees; Yea, all the pure life-story Learned at my mother's knees. My sorrows and my prayers, sweet, My groaning and my tears, The balm of summer airs, sweet, Hopes, agonies, and fears; All these your strong soul shares, sweet, Yea, all the long, long years! The years before we met, sweet, Before dear passion spoke, And tender eyes were wet, sweet, And love his golden yoke Upon our shoulders set, sweet, And all the old fetters broke. I give thee all these things, sweet; My body and my soul My utter passion brings, sweet,â Myself: I give the whole. I've got no golden wings, sweet, No nectared honeyed bowl. But womanhood's dear whiteness Of body, spirit, mind, And lips of untouched brightness, And faithfulness thou'lt find! Oh, love hath perfect rightness, And sweetly all designed! Oh, take me: hold me close, sweet, I'm but a woman's soul, A clinging woman-rose, sweet, Whose tendrils round thee stole To find in thee repose sweet, Love, husband, heaven-joy, goal! YEARNING. Sad are all we to think Of sorrows, and wasted lives In the dim great towns, in the hives Of the people; for one that thrives, How many lost souls sink, Sink each day, do you think? Why does He not stay His hand, God, who knows of it all? Was He strong to slacken the thrall Of the Jews, and Jericho's wall To shake for a Hebrew bandâ Shortened for us is His hand? If we are too many, we protest; If we are too many for His eye To cover, for Him to espy, Let us cease to be, let us die; Let us sink in the sea to our rest, And cease not, dying, to protest. To protest against high God who made More souls than His hands could keep, Who holdeth our sad tears cheap, And agony all we reap, The reward with which we are paid, We, whom alive He has made. But, if He has not forgotten Any whom His hands have made, And no one, of all men, has strayed From His sight; if He covers with His shade Each of us, by Him begotten, It is well, our torment is stayed. Here, upon earth, it is wrong For a father to leave his child Without a provision; less mild Than a mother is God who has smiled The world into being? we are strong, Were it so, to say it is wrong. Surely, in His hand, for each Hidden, must our God have in store Gifts He is willing to outpour, Waiting, and willing, and more; Waiting till He can reach With His own, the hand of each. Waiting until each cries For his Father, and looks to His hand; Then will His bounty expand, And silent deserts of sand Beneath sun, beneath blue sweet skies, Shall be changed to a green glad land. 1870. A FAREWELL TO POETRY. I take within mine hand The relics of the land Of dreams and songs and hopes and fair past glory; I gather all the past And round about it cast A mistlike robe of soft remembrance hoary; My singing days I bind Together, and swift wind In one the golden threads of life's fast-deepening story. Dear blossoms, roses red, That once about my head Waved with a flood of soft caressing splendour, I bid you all farewell; Yea, to each flower that fell Upon youth's brows from heaven with flower-touch tender; A long goodbye to allâ White roses, lilies tall; I would not fail to one sweet final thanks to render. O ferns and meadow-sweet, O rivulets that beat With silvery footing once amid the grasses, A long, long, long goodbye! O many a sunset sky, O giant purple clouds in heaped-up masses, O seas that climbed and surged, By wintry storm-blasts urged, Farewellâere from you all my mortal vision passes! Goodbye, goodbye, goodbyeâ Blue perfect summer sky, And all the dreams of youth and hopes that wandered Towards heaven on sun-bright wings: A new chant in me rings, And gone are the old ecstasies I pondered; Farewell, ye high designs, The wreath that manhood twines Is better than the leaves youth wildly plucked and squandered. O happy days of song That, when my heart was strong, Brought me life's holiest rest and sweetest treasure, For ever, now, farewell: The silent time-waves swell, And their foam-crests no man can pass or measure Beyond the singing days, Beyond the need of bays, Urge meâtowards death's sublime unidle wakeful leisure. To those who love, I leave What my hand doth achieve Of passionate pure love-praise and worthy singing: The lovers who shall come When this my voice is dumb Shall hear in song faint echoes of it ringing, And I shall seem to be In heaven or on the sea, Or in the blossoms round their ladies' white brows clinging. Oh, am I not a part Of England's songful heart, And can I pass and be no more a token? Shall not the lovers young To whom my soul hath sung Hear by my chant the summer silence broken? Shall not some girlish heart Tremble and bound and start, As if a real live voice some sudden word had spoken? I cannot wholly die If from the blue dear sky I bend in gracious song above true lovers; If in the forest deep Among the leaves I sleep, And murmur 'mid the green, close-foliaged covers; If o'er the eternal sea Some sign and speech of me In the wide track of pure mysterious moonlight hovers. If in my city too, London made great and new, My voice is heard, though I am gone for ever; If lovers, in my town, My singing for a crown Wear, then as the red sunset ceaseth never, I too shall never cease, Nor dwindle nor decrease, Nor from my well-loved streets my spirit-presence sever. So, farewell, lovers all! Around me once I call The well-known English flowers and English faces: On every side of me Dear blossoms I would see Once more, sweet petals plucked from all loved places; And round me once again The glad strong looks of men My friends I'd meet,âand eyes whose light all sorrow chases. Sweet eyes of love once more Upon me, as before, Glance tenderly, lift once again long lashes! And, ocean, once more sound, And blossoms, once abound, For every flower some pang of death abases! And, lyre of mine, one song In death's teeth, clear and strong Cast,âere death's conquering tide across my heart-strand dashes! Then let me pass from life, And song and love and strife, Content, my labour done, my soul not fearing; Not doubting that I go Towards regions where the glow Of sunset on our mountains disappearing Is a new rose-red day On grander peaks than they, Peaks which my ardent swift fatigueless foot is nearing. TO ELLA DIETZ: POET AND ACTRESS. I O dark-eyed singer And soft sweet bringer Of dreams that haunt us with dear white wings, Singer that comest From far and hummest The tune new to us that through thee rings, Lift us we pray thee, From day to day thee Seeking, as round us thy soft soul clings. II In new sweet glowing Soft numbers flowing Sing to us of lands we ne'er have known; Of rivers whose tides Lave measureless sides And lakes that put to the shame our own, And forests gigantic, And breathe the Atlantic Upon us in song, by the great winds blown. III Thou bringest for dower A new world's power And thine own beauty of voice and heart; Gifted as thou, With the genius-brow, Why shouldst thou ever retreat, depart? Stay with us rather Sweet one, and gather Crowns for thy young head, crowns for thine Art. IV Gather the flowers Here growing from bowers Wherein thy young fair feet shall tread; Lo! England's pages From far strange ages Yearn for thee, burn for thee, wait to be read; The might of our race Shall flame in thy face And gird thee and arm thee and ring thine head. V Thou comest to add Thine own soul glad Or sorrowful sometimes unto the few Great women who live With us ever and give Their hearts so tender, so sweet of hue, To the ages, to bless, To heal and redress, Whose souls are as song-birds heard in the blue. VI At seasons a queen Immortal, serene, Is sent by Apollo to lift and delight: Her golden hair Is his fetter, his snare, And it draws by its glory, allures by its might; For a season she stands With his harp in her hands And we mark in her eyes the god's glance bright. VII So is it with thee: From over the sea Thou comest a new song bringing, divine; The god in thine eyes As the sun in the skies, And the voice of the god in the sound of thy rhyme; Black-haired, Apollo The gold-haired follow Towards heights yet grander, peaks more sublime. VIII With self-denial, Through pain, through trial, The high god follow, and work his will: Not those he chooses Whom pain refuses To crown,ânot such doth the high god thrill; Yea, those who would follow The steps of Apollo Must face the night-wind bitter and shrill. IX Not in the daylight, Fickle and gay light, Are high crowns fashioned, and great songs sung: Lo! through the starlight The gold-haired far light Apollo is seen and his voice hath rung Beneath the moonlight, Breathing a tune light Which round the red lips eddied and clung. X If thou wilt find him, Seize and wilt bind him, High up the mountains, beneath the stars, Follow thou fearless; The rough rocks cheerless Traverse and heed not the moist fresh scars; High in the azure Thou shalt have pleasure, Beyond all limits, above all bars. XI But few can follow King-god Apollo; And of these singers, of women how few There have been truly Who faithfully, duly, The great god served and his greatness knew; Wilt thou make over As bard, as lover, Thy soul to the song-god, canst thou be true? XII Yea, true for ever, Though gladdened never By voice delusive of fluctuant praise Of dim-souled hearer; Oh how far clearer Ring out Apollo's own splendid lays! The sun-god's kiss, Thou mayest have this, The sun-god's lips, and the song-god's bays. XIII Lift up thy spirit, Make thine and inherit Our land's past story, our country's calm; Let our seas gladden thee, Our sorrows sadden thee, Our summers soothe thee with waft of balm; Our winters brace thee, Our hearts encase thee As thou our roses within thy palm. XIV Let every flower In every bower Of England greet thee with upturned face; Rose and each lily And hair-bell hilly And delicate snowdrop's maiden grace; And snow-drop girls With golden curls Brought for thy welcome from many a place. XV Thy voice shall reach us, Thine heart shall teach us Of things we know not: thy lyre shall sound By the great white surges The North wind urges With terrible glee, as it shakes the ground; And in our summer O sweet new-comer Thy softer songs shall laugh and abound. XVI Thyself a flower Thy pure scent shower O fair flower-singer about our shore: A new scent tender Of new strange splendour, Sweet as the scents were gathered of yore From the harp-swaying fingers Of some three singers Who sang the song-god's altar before. XVII Some three or four, Apollo no more Took pains to nurture nor cared to crown: They passed away from us And took the day from us, And all the leaves of our life were brown, And autumn came And the dead year's shame At their departure and cold death's frown. XVIII Now, dark-eyed chanter, Be giver, be granter Of new spring to us; bid England's plains At thy sweet footing Awake, forth-shooting New green shafts as at the soft spring-rains Bid summer blossoms Ope bright glad bosoms, And violets peep in the moist moss-lanes. XIX Arising later, Thou shalt be greater Than many and many who came and sang Till the high hills sounded As songs abounded, And the echoing sea-waves laughed and they rang: Thou shalt step higher, With more sweet fire Within thy spirit, more pure song-pang. XX Not bay-leaves olden But his own golden Dear locks Apollo shall bend and twine Within thy dark, Like many a spark Of flame-flies floating, let loose in thine: And an English rose In the dark hair glows To render it ever and ever divine. TO KATHLEEN GORDON, GIRL-GENIUS. I O girl-soul tender, And girl-form slender, What dreams have traversed from side to side Thy young fair being, Beyond our seeingâ What thoughts have smitten with wing-wafts wide The moonlit ocean Of hopes in motion, Around thee surging in life's first pride. II Dreaming for ever, Despairing never, How beautiful art thou, spirit divine! A blossom in girl-shape, Purer than pearl-shape, Born upon earth as a rose to shine; Born to deliver The souls that quiver From arrows of life as from salt sea-brine. III Born to delight us With song-beams that smite us, Calm, gladden us, heal usâdreaming of things That men dream never And reach not ever With masculine strong stern struggle of wings; Teacher of poet, Thou dost not know it, But sweet within thee our song-god sings. IV Sings, and he brings to us Tender soft wings, to us Showing delights new, found not of old; In thy light fairy Dear diction airy The song-god speaks and his speech is of gold, And he laughs in laughter Of thine, and, after, He clings to us, sings to us, gentle but bold. V Thou wast a flower In some dim bower Of Paradise, doubt not; now thou art here To sing for years to us, Laughter and tears to us, Spread forth thy pinions, and have no fear; The airs will carry thee, Thy genius marry thee In thought to spirits whose songs are clear. VI Whose songs are tender, Grave, and of splendour Divine in ages long past and dead: Shelley shall sing to thee And Keats' soul cling to thee; For robe and raiment, to crown thine head, Thou shalt have glory Of ages hoary, The singing of past days round thee shed. VII Hold to thy power O girl, O flower, Both firm and humble, both true and brave; Hearts thou shalt gladden, Some souls perhaps sadden, But more deliver and heal and save; Add to our pleasure With thy sweet treasure Of fancies bountiful, frolick or grave. VIII Twine for our meadows Sunbeams and shadows Of delicate true song, as in the strain Thou just hast given us, Whose dart hath riven us Wondering to find in the song-god's fane So young a singer, So sweet a bringer Of gifts that only the young flowers gain. IX For only the singers, Young, sweet, are bringers Of all that falls from the high god's hand; Yea, such souls only, Pure, wondrous, lonely, Before Apollo uncrowned, crowned, stand; Crowned not as older Bards fiercer or colder, But crowned with rosebuds, band upon band. X Not e'en with bay-leaves, Sorrow's dark stray leaves, But only rosebuds bright as the morn, Bright as thine own heart; Just as thou blown art Yesterday only, so these were born Yesterday, sweet one, Subtle and fleet oneâ From rose-twigs for thee were plucked and torn. XI Thy white brow bears yet No sign of cares, yet Some sorrow thy song would seem to pour; Thou hast within thee Strange thoughts that win thee, Lure thee and draw thee to lands before; To seasons unseen yet, Cloudless, serene yet, Towards passions the years yet garner in store. XII O girl-heart dreaming Of gold hair gleaming And anthems swelling, and dark bright eyes, Thy young life coming, Like far wings humming Above the blossoms 'neath sunstruck skies, Hints of its wonder Breathesâin the thunder Of night, and the light of moons that rise. XIII A flower thou blowest, Just that,ânor knowest The strange lands shadowed thy feet shall tread; Best that thou know not, While such skies glow not, Fierce, sultry, scorching, above thine head; The sunrise over thee Shields, like a lover, thee; What knowst thou, child-heart, of sunset red? XIV Thou needst not linger Pale sweet girl-singer As yet, nor ponder by death's dark streams; Yet, in thy singing Their ripples ringing Surge upward slowly, and softest dreams Pour through thy yearning Heart bounding and burning, And crown thy spirit with weird sad gleams. XV Dreams thou hast fashioned, Tender, impassioned, Of death, of heaven, of things unseen; But wings supremer O dear girl-dreamer Than angels' even shall o'er thee lean; Love's plumes shall crown thee, In sweet joy drown thee, Ere death thou facest, soft and serene. XVI Ere death thou facest In love's thou placest Thy palm so trustful and towards love's eyes Thou gazest upward As heaven and hopeward, As towards star-blazoned and spotless skies: Not for us only The young song lonely On lonely wing-beats glitters and flies. XVII Thou shalt be flower In love's fair hour To those we see notâto him we see Not either; lady Now 'neath the shady Dear branches supple of youth's slim tree Resting, and singing The soft songs clinging To girl-friends' spirits, to many, to me. XVIII But dream thou onward Moonward and sunward, Starward and seaward, skyward,âand hold Dear, dear, the flowing Locks, golden, glowing, Thy sweet songs tell of,âfor nought but gold Thou wilt, thou sayest; Thy voice delayest Never for black locks, true to the old! XIX Yet perhaps in ages Which thy song-pages Now dream not of, blue glances or brown May flash above thee, Wound thee, or love thee, More than the looks which pain thee or crown In soft white girlhood, Jewel-hood, pearl-hood,â Smile thee to heaven, or slay with a frown. XX But howso be it Thou mayest not flee it, Thy song, thy mission of music and pain: Pain; for the poet Must, heart-wrung, know it, Or worthless, feeble and false, his strain: Music; for these Poems, in MS., by Kathleen Gordon, aged fourteen. Songs blown on the breeze In the heart of the world as a gift remain. GOD AND BEAUTY. What is the meaning of it all? Surely God did not create Souls of His people in hate, Handing to instruments of fate, Binding in bitterness of thrall, His children; giving us gall, Gall to eat, vinegar to drink; We who long for the eyes Of Beauty, and look to the prize That in arms of endurance lies, Neither from fires do we shrink; Heart of not one of us flies. If God is strong to succeed, Then we can trust and abide, Rest in the shadow of His side, Trust in the God we have tried, Careless, ready to bleed; If He is strong to succeed. Nothing we care for but this, That in harmony God shall bring Out of each of us some good thing, Tuning our voices to sing; Beauty is one thing and bliss; Nothing we care for but this. Why did He give to us love, Only to take it away? Love the light of a day, That lasts but the spring of a spray Beneath the feet of a dove; Why did He give to us love? Love we have seen, and we know, Yea, we know she is fair; Yea, we have woven her hair In our hands, and who shall compare To her limbs the new-fallen snow? Love we have seen, and we know. God we know not, neither see; Neither in heaven, nor on earth; News was there once of His birth, Men shook hands in their mirth, Women laughed in their glee; Where now, tell us, is He? One thing we know, we are sad; Yet the face we have seen Of Beauty, and hands of our Queen, And light of her eyes between Dark clouds and mists we have had, And sight of her garments' sheen. If God loves her as we, And with His power (as they say, Strong as the might of the day) Brings her to pass as we pray, Souls of us calm can be; If so He loves her as we. We who love but the scent Of the wave of her hair in the way As the flowers the dawn of the day, Love her more than our words can say, And towards the road that she went Would fall on our knees and pray. We who have given up all To be unto her as the dew To the sun; who have sworn to be true; We who are glad in the blue, But beneath the grey skies fall As a song-bird struck right through. If God cares for her face Then we love Him, and stand Ready to cling to His hand, To be led of Him up to the land Of promise, His own fair place, A gladsome, a wished-for strand. If God cares for her not, Neither is willing to bring Beauty in everything To be, let pale priests sing! Faces with tears we blot, Fingers of wailing we wring. But one hope yet avails; That out of the smoke and the dust Blossom a rose-tree must; This is the sole strong trust To close up a mouth that rails; This one hope yet avails. Hope that if we are cast down, All unable to stand, If our faces are fanned By fires of hell, and the land Is dark, yet God's is the crown And mighty His strong right hand. Yea, if He treads upon us, Beautiful souls to make, Let us not tremble nor quake, Let us not quaver nor shake; Little let God heed us, If Beauty our Queen is at stake! She whom of all we adore; Loving the feathers of her wings, Breath of the air where she sings, Sound of the motion she brings As she shakes the ethereal floor, And the light that about her clings. Loving the light of her eyes As the bird the breath of the morn, As the hound the lilt of the horn, As the sun the beauty of dawn, The face of his bride in the skies By the mists of night from him torn. As the sailors watching at night The first faint flush in the air Of the streaks of the wind-waved hair Of Aurora, and fingering fair Of the clouds touching in fresh light, As a sign to us all she is there. As a man tired-out through the day The first fresh fall of the dews That give to a worker the news That at last he may cast off the shoes Of fatigue, and hasten away, Nor longer his rest refuse. As a lover who has not seen For a weary sighing of years, For a long outpouring of tears, For a manifold mist of fears, The face of a maiden, a queen, Is glad, when her footstep nears. As a mother, who longs for her son Gone to the fire of the wars, Gone as it were to the stars So the distance seems, that mars His features, is like to run To the sound of home-coming cars. As all these love, we too Are in love with the face of our Queen, We poets; we who have seen Her glory, the light of the sheen Of her raiment; only a few In the print of her passing have been. 1870. TO SHELLEY. I Thy spirit which trod, Gold-sandalled, a god, The grass, that blossomed beneath its tread, At Oxford and saw, Unsmitten of awe, The centuries gathered behind it in red Vast sunset-waves, Doth it live yet, and saves Immortal its glory among the dead? II The surf of the sea Of thought was to thee But calm clear ripples of inland lakes Wherein to delight With free-swimming might 'Mid the blue dear surges and white foam-flakes: In the old grey town Thou plaitedst thy crown, Oxford, and threadedst its harsh thought-brakes. III God was to thee As the voice of the sea, As the wings of the surges, the plumes of the blast: Little indeed Of the tame pale creed That broods blood-stricken above the past Thy soul did reck; Without rein, without check, It followed its own God-yearning vast. IV Marsh-marigolds Each dense dyke holds By Oxford, and long grass-fields at night Gleam weird and strange, And the low hill-range Is purple at sunset against the bright Sky orange or red; And the moonrays wed O'er the silvery river the last faint light. V These thou didst see, And seen too of me Were the weird grey hollows, the wild long hills, The gleaming expanse Of the ripples that dance On Isis, and all that the swift gaze fills From Iffley to where The white waves tear At Sandford the foam that the fierce stream spills. VI Then thou didst fly The dim mist-sky Of England and sangest in Italy's vales, More sweet than the sound Heard there without bound As it throbs and rises, ascends and fails, Of the nightingale-song When its ecstasy strong Now triumphs and leaps, now weeps and wails. VII What didst thou know Of love? Was it woe, Or gladness passing the frail mute dream Of men who aspire But find not a lyre Like thine, so watch but thy gold harp-gleam As it glittereth swept By the fingers that slept, That rested, never from song's bright theme? VIII Oh, love to thee Was as soft as the sea At softest even: it was not the sound Of the fierce-tongued surges The fierce breeze scourgesâ It was as the blossoms that star the ground, Filled with perfume And glory of bloom, A mantle of beauty to plain and mound. IX Were the women who wove For thee raiment of love As stars of passion within thine hair? Bright stars merely, Or loved more nearlyâ Who was thy bride, most sweet of the fair Women who gave Lips gracious to save, And filled thy summer with rose-sweet air? X What laughter of bright Lips, beauty of white Limbs ever sufficed for, satisfied thee? What rose was as red As thy dreams on it shed? Yea, thy thoughts were more white than the waves of the sea, And the heavens unclear By thy song-sky dear, Wherethrough thou wast wont to exult and flee. XI What rich buds even In Italy's heaven Were rich as the buds in the dreams of thy song? What marvellous flow Of ripples aglow Danced gold in the sunlight, white in the throng Of the white moonbeams, Through the winged soft dreams Of thy spirit alert, divine and strong? XII Oh, blossoms indeed, A princely meed, Thou hast given us, Shelley: and skies and seas, And the voice of a rhyme Unending, sublime, And the laughter of fays in the leafage of trees, And the tidal motion Of song's sweet ocean, The glitter of insects, the humming of bees. XIII The universe In thy pure verse Gloweth and floweth, speaketh and sings: From rose to lily, From vale to hilly Far rock-bound region on far-spread wings Thou floatest and seizest What bloom thou pleasest; Yea, what thou willest, thy quick harp brings. XIV And so in the sphere Of high thought, clear And brave thy voice is, fearless, unchained: Thou wast not afraid Of Calvary's shade; Free on the hill-top thy foot remained: Thou wast not bound By the calm sweet sound Of Christ's voice, nor by the Church-crimes stained. XV Pure of the flood Of innocent blood Spilt by the Church thou wast: for a friend Christ thou knewest And in skies bluest Of great thought soughtest him, didst not bend; Thy bright head never Need bend, nor ever Can Christ in the sheer song-land contend. XVI He hath his crown, And thou thine own, Shelley,âthy song-crown perfect indeed: His wreath of pain He hath, and his fane, And the thorns that yet on the white brow bleed; But thou, an immortal, By thine own portal Mayest enter the gates of the God we need. XVII For England in song Untrammelled and strong Yearn we to hear now, not to be told Of deeds outworn, In a far land born; We need but love, to our hearts to hold, And the lips of the rose That in England blows, Woman, sweeter than women of old. XVIII Not Palestine, Nor the fig and the vine, But the corn and the clover, the clear-eyed maid On the cliff-top standing With glance commanding Searching our broad seas,âthe oak-trees' shade, The purple heather, The grey wild weather In England, the furze-crowned fern-lined glade. XIX This we need: Thou gavest a creed, Shelley, which brings us high help now; God in the soul Of each, and the whole Of the leafy wide world, not one bough Of a palm-tree faded, And grasped in jaded Priest's handsâbroken and tangled how! XX Thou wast the first Through whose song burst The chant of England, freeing her soul From the dry harsh letter, The ruinous fetter Of creeds that around her white limbs stole As ravening snakes In the dead-branch brakes: She gives thee her rose-heart, gives thee the whole! TO KEATS. I O crowned immortal Who through the portal Of life didst pass to a deathless tomb, Where art thou singing And thine hands bringing Immortals blossoms of grander bloom Than those that awoke At thy swift harp-stroke Ere our earth failed thee and rang thy doom? II What dreams surrounded Thy young soul bounded And barred on all sides as thou didst sing Of cowslip and daisy And spring morns hazy, Soft-brooding ever with young white wing Above our meadows, And through time's shadows Moving, a song-god, an uncrowned king? III What dreams we know not, Which thy songs show not, Filled thy young spirit and smote thine heart With stroke as of oars Nigh musical shores, Some with sweet pleasure and some with smart? What thoughts supreme In a flash, in a dream, Of love, of life, of thine own fair Art? IV Ne'er wast thou wingless, But alway stingless, Pure alway, gentle and tender and high: A poet indeed With thine heart for a creed And thy temple the uttermost deep blue sky, And the sound of the sea For hymnal to thee, And the voice of the breeze for thy soul's own sigh. V The stars were thine own And thy locks were blown By the wind of the night as a spirit indeed Of friendliest greeting; Thy heart swift-beating Went traversing valley and dingle and mead, Finding in each Songs sweeter than speech Of the birds who sang to thee, tuned thy reed. VI Greek-souled, Greek-eyed, Thy spirit espied Things hidden from all of us, given to thee For balm and delight; Full oft through the night Or the tangle of leaves 'mid the boughs of a tree Came nymphs new-risen For thee from their prison, And mermaids shone in the gulfs of the sea. VII The dead ideal To thee was real; And real life gave thee one strange sweet dream: Thou diedst crying On one, far-flying In spirit to where our white waves gleam From Italy's shore; One loved as of yore, And sought while launched upon death's still stream. VIII What hast thou now, Keats? visited how Is the heaven-high spirit by love's glance bright? What tresses are fair In the summer-soft air, More summer-soft ever for pulse of the flight Of song-woven pinions Which flood the dominions Of death with torrents of golden light? IX Hath thy kiss lighted Soft and invited On dear lips redder than lips of queens Who make this earth to us Gracious in mirth, to us Bringing the glory of all sweet scenes? Whom hast thou wedded, White-souled, gold-headed? What breast above thee with rapture leans? X Oh, are they fairer, Those queens, and rarer In passionate beauty than flowers below Loved and proclaimed of us? Are they ashamed of us? Seek they for singers whose lips they know In heaven, and we hear not, Worship, revere not,â Scorn they the passions our songs bestow? XI Hath love the splendour, The dear glow tender, In heaven that crowns us toiling and tired? Hast thou Keats fashioned New lyrics impassioned, By love of celestial sweet eyes fired? Now is thy song As soft and more strong, By the women of deathland sought and inspired? XII Oh are they sweet With lily-clear feet, And lips like the scent of the first May rose In a shower at morn; And their laugh is it born In the high pure air where no frail foot goes, But only the singer's Firm step that lingers Gentian-like 'mid the untouched snows? XIII Thy dreams now are blessed, Thy soul is at rest Having passed from the earth where never a bard Hath trodden save sadly, Endlessly, madly, To struggle in fate's steel bondage hard, Till sweet death came And her plumage of flame Left the prison-barriers crushed and charred. XIV Then comes the sky, The night wind's sigh, The sense of release and the leaves of the trees Tenderly dancing And gold stars glancing O'er billows of limitless fetterless seas, And the terrible gladness, Transfiguring sadness, Of visions of moonlit and measureless leas. XV One day to each of us, Close, within reach of us, Comes the waft of the rose-like breath Of the passionate bride For whom we have sighed, Yea, the passionate exquisite bosom of death, And the lips of the night Soft, flower-light, And the word that the night's mouth whispering saith. XVI Then shall we see The kingdom of thee, Keats? all thy treasure uncounted, untold? Thy brides in the sky And thine ecstasy high, And thy laughter as tender and clear as of old, And thy singing supreme, Like love's through a dream, Rich from thy god's mouth moulded of gold. XVII Or hast thou found And conquered and bound Some sweet flower-singer as soft and as young In heaven, and chained her, Loved and retained her For ever while ever thy glad lips sung Perfect, divine to her, Sweet line by line to herâ Wonderful honeyed decoys of thy tongue? XVIII Oh, is she listening, The soft eyes glistening At all the magic of thy fond strain? Now no more lonely Thou art but only Alone with one in the love-god's fane: Rested at last With sorrow in the past Dead, while the flowers of the past remain. XIX Through the soft June light, Summer clear moonlight, Conquering spirits, I cry to your land: Crown us at last too, Suffering the blast too Of sorrow; stretch down a white strong hand To singers who need Your presence indeed, Who yet uncrowned on the dim earth stand. XX O bride of Keats Whose heart now beats For the singer whose spirit knows pain no more, Remember that we 'Mid the waves of the sea Of time yet struggle,âhear thou the roar Of the breakers: oh aid Till we too have made The ultimate haven, the sorrowless shore! THREE SONNETS. I. THE CHRISTS OF THE AGES. There are whose spirit-pangs do far exceed The pangs the Hebrew weaveth in his crown: Not on one Son of God high God smiled down, But such throughout the foolish centuries bleed. Oh, thrice accursed is the small dim creed That cramps its votaries' souls before one Cross; Poor mole-eyed spirits! they count all sufferings dross Save Christ's,âthe English blood-rose but a weed! The Christs o' the ages, men and women fair In spirit as was Christ, or fairer far, Are crucified indeedâno perfumed air Of incense-worship crowns them, and no star Gleams apostolic, fiery, o'er their head: Men worship not; God worships them instead. (Written on the eve of Good Friday, March 25, 1880.) II. THE CRUCIFIXION OF MANHOOD. (For Good Friday, 1880.) To-day, as ever, pale mankind is nailed Upon the bitter cross; the people go To weep false tears o'er overrated woe,â Weeping because one far-off fair life failed. And what of heights of manhood left unscaled To-day, because this piteous farce runs so? What of the sufferers dying beneath snow Of want of love to-day, by no hymns hailed? Ah! shall there be an Easter morn for these, As through the blood-stained centuries not one day Hath not loomed like Good Friday gaunt and grey Upon them; from grim immemorial seas Of timeless suffering, grievous, marred and wan, What Easter torch shall light the spirit of man? III. THE CRUCIFIXION OF WOMANHOOD. And what of woman? Shall she not arise Splendid as risen Christ on Easter morn,â Seeking, dew-kissed, sun-crowned, a flower new-born, Untraversed haunts of unfamiliar skies? Shall not the sweet God shine within her eyes? Shall not her swordless white hand laugh to scorn The pale black-armoured foes who would have torn Her banner down, that floated lily-wise? Oh, Christ is risen; leave his grave in peace. Rise thou, O woman, from thine own poor dreams; Lo! even for thee an Easter morning gleams Triumphant, and thine utter woes shall cease Mayhap: no more shall flow the sacred blood Of crucified, sad, tortured womanhood. (Written on Easter Eve, March 27, 1880.) SO HE CEASED TO BELIEVE IN MAN. A thinker, young, was worried and stung By gibes of friends and priests; The peace he sought could not be brought By pleasure or jovial feasts; A peace they proffered, a rest they offered Far from the battle's vanâ So he ceased to believe in Man! He ceased to believe in Man and receive The gifts Man has to hold: The strong despair whose face is fair, Yea, sweeter than wrought gold; The endless scope of desperate hope; The proud Church waved her fanâ So he ceased to believe in Man! He could no more upon the shore Delight in ocean's waves; He could no longer stand far stronger Than foam-white leagues of graves; His power was spent, his head was bent, He trembled, pale and wanâ So he ceased to believe in Man! The glorious earth no more with mirth Unutterable delayed him: The pleasant flowers and woodbine bowers Had all, he thought, betrayed him; The roses red were fickle and dead; He could not life's girth spanâ So he ceased to believe in Man! The wondrous sound of music bound His being now in vain; A woman's eyes (wherein there lies A cure for every pain) Could not entreat, were no more sweet; He failed their depth to scanâ So he ceased to believe in Man! And heaven-sent love was but a dove, No lustre on its pinions; The struggle of thought went all for nought, The woods were death's dominions; The azure sky was hollow and dry, Earth groaned beneath a banâ So he ceased to believe in Man! SO HE ENTERED THE CHURCH OF ROME. Then pale priests came with comfort tame But grateful to his soul; They offered him a temple dim, They brought an honeyed bowl; He could not shrink, he chose to drink; He sought a quiet homeâ So he entered the Church of Rome! He ceased to plead, he ceased to bleed, He cannot struggle now; He cannot fight, he has lost the light, It flames not on his brow; Far from the rattle of earth's wild battle His frail feet longed to roamâ So he entered the Church of Rome! He longed for peace and calm release From all the labour of thought; He longed for pleasure and gentle leisureâ He has found the gifts he sought: High thought is curbed, he is not disturbed; He yearned for a painted domeâ So he entered the Church of Rome! His heaven is sure, his bliss secure, The angels wait for him; His harp is ready beyond the eddy Of death's stream cold and dim; His bright robe waits beyond the gates Of heaven: he shunned life's foamâ So he entered the Church of Rome! His joy is certain: he draws the curtain On earth, and its windy fate; He cares not now what furrows plough Our foreheads, what sore weight Of trouble and care we have to bear; His feet stuck in earth's loamâ So he entered the Church of Rome! He shrank from thoughtâthe terror it brought, Its passionate joy as well: He shall not see the life of the free, His high Church is his hell; He shall not enter the fair centre Of Man's perfect home, Far from the Church of Rome. CHRIST AND WOMAN. Are there not, O king, King of many lands, Brooding with broad wing Over seas and sands, Free yet from thine hands, Full many shores whereto free joyous spirits cling? Are there not, O lord Of the church-fed air Which is round us poured For our birth-day fare In England everywhere, Yet souls untrammelled girt with courage for a sword? If our women find In thee all they seek, Deaf and pale and blind, Noble not but weakâ Yet hath not some cheek Of woman flushed for love of her own kith and kind? If our chur ches groan With the praise they pour In their weary tone On thee evermore, Yet hath not some shore Crowns of another Christ, and other worship known? Is the rose more red Since the Saviour's birth? Or the lily's head Tenderer in worth? Greener is the earth? Doth any Lazarus here come smiling from the dead? Do the loaves increase For our needy crowd? Do our terrors cease? Doth the ghostlike shroud Of sorrow at the loud Mandate of any Christ divide, disclosing peace? Have the high sheer waves At Christ's bidding spared Seamen,âhave the graves That their gulfs prepared Yielded souls that dared To tempt the awful deep back from their frothy caves? Have the breakers stood Silent at the touch Of a Saviour good, Rescuing from their clutch Souls he valued much? Have blossoms burned new-born on rods of barren wood? Hath the grave again Opened to set free Any sons of men,â Given to liberty Any soul that we Have marked its iron bars and bitter paling pen? What hath Christ for these English yearning souls Done that they should cease, As the world-wave rolls Onward over shoals And sunken reefs, to seek in their own spirits peace? Peace within the shores Where their life was born, Over which God pours Crimson blush of morn, Which he clothes with corn,â Round which their sails are white, and round which throb their oars. Pleasure in the land That indeed their own They may call, and stand On it as a throne, By its breezes blown, Girt with its cliffs and yellow wastes of seawashed sand. Oh, is this not ours, All this island-shore? Green and glad with bowers; Undismayed by war; Over which there pour Fresh from God's fruitful hand the ever-fruitful showers. Is it not thine own, Brother? why then seek Alien shores and groan, Awe-struck at the peak Of Sinai, or some creek Whose rocky bluffs once rang to Christ's alluring tone? Why this discontent? Why this wild desire, Longing ever bent With increasing fire On an Eastern lyre, That wayward and harsh-toned uncertain instrument? Are not the strong seas Of our pent-up coast Touched by wintry breeze Music deep? a host Of singers we may boast, Yea may not we?âthe birds among our summer trees? And have not we the grace Of perfect womanhood Among usâyea, each face, Sweet and pure and good, Womanly in mood, Brings God before us, God made plain in every place. Christs we have, and kings: Women-Christs divine, Bearing snowier wings Than the wings that shine, Noble in outline, Upon the Christ who on the rain-dyed gibbet swings. Is not Woman more Even than the rose? Shall she not, too, soar Past all earthly woes, Till bright gates disclose In heaven heroic hearts for her too to adore? Are not her lips sweet, And her tresses fair? And shall she retreat, Hustled through the air, When her foes declare That God's step sounds alone in Christ's approaching feet? Is not every bride Unto us as pure As the Christ who sighed In the groves obscure Where e'en now endure Stories that drip with blood, memories of how he died? Did he rise alone? Shall not we too rise To our fitting throne, Triumph in our eyes, Cleaving sundered skies,â Have we not too the Father, and his glory known? Hath the Father one Only child and heir? Favourite chief son, Who alone may share All the treasures fair Amassed since first his Sire creative toil begun? Shall not Woman rise Bursting all the bars That now mock her sighs, Sweep along the starsâ All that stays and mars Long left behind in lower undertrodden skies? Shall she not surpass Saviours and ascend To the seas of glass, All high heaven for friend? Is there any end To blossoms that smile upward, round her, from the grass? Hath the Holy Ghost Not a cliff-top lair Somewhere in our coast? Is not English air Sweet enough and fair Enough to bring down many a bright angelic host? White and pure indeed Are the angels seen With us, whose feet bleed 'Mid the grasses green; Thick clouds fail to screen From us high heaven; we have the angel-help we need. Not in this our age Did the Christ-king rise: Not his war we wage 'Neath our stormier skies, Echo not his sighs; Contend not, as did he, with winds' and waters' rage. Rather in the stress Of our surging thought Struggle we no less: No less hearts have brought Purified of aught That might obscure or cloud the faith our tongues confess. The utter faith in man And the Power that leads Onward through life's span Man,âwho toils and bleeds, Suffers and succeeds, Completes at last the work his birthday breath began. Faith in the great soul Human, and the Power Latent in the whole, Sweet in the rose-bower, Tender in love's hour, Who, silent, works on towards the foreseen certain goal. Faith in man's soul's light, And the perfect doom Of day to follow night; Night again with gloom To rest us, and entomb The sadness of the day, healing with gentle might. Faith in the course of things, Certain and sublime, Towards the utmost springs Of morning: towards a clime Sunnier, and a rhyme Beating more gladsome yet through broad creation's wings. Therefore not one King Worship we, but crown Man, and 'neath man's wing Gladly rest,âand down Towards life's furrows brown We look; no more our hands round heaven's flower-stalks cling. Woman we elect Tender snow-white queen: Man, the lord, is decked Now in lordly sheen; Priests who came between Man and the Power that made, with anger we reject. For God's mouth shall bend, Tender, unto each, Kissing each as Friend, If we will but reach Upward, and beseech, Fearless, the Power that wrought, to mould us to the end. TO GERTRUDE ENTERING A CONVENT. Ah! weak and frailâbut yet so sweet, so pure! Thou art English, rosebud! yet could'st not endure The strong salt breeze, but must thy soul secure Within these close-barred flowerless scentless gates. Thou art English: yet the sweet and stalwart breeze That laughs delighted 'mid our bright oak trees And sweeps across the emerald lavish leas Thou could'st not bear; what breeze thy coming waits? O all shut in apart from suns and stars Within these bloomless barren spouseless bars, How black a cowardly crime thy girlhood mars, Thine English girlhood, spoilt by froward fates! How deep a weak-souled crime thy life begins! How crowned thy forehead is with others' sins! Oh, if the eternal Bridegroom thee, sweet, wins, Thou art not won, if love's pursuit abates! Yea, if love's English foot throughout the gloom Thee follows not, nor cares to seek thy tomb, Thou art lostâyea, lost, for all the hectic bloom That heaven upon thy pale cheek reinstates. Thou art lost, abandoned, sold: thy body young That English true lips might have loved and sung Is buried deep, deep; round thy neck have clung Foul serpents of the dusk, like hissing hates. O flower, white flower, why wilt thou thus away? O rose, sweet rose, why will thy footsteps stray? Lo! night before thee lies, but crimson day Behind; oh pause ere yet the last bolt grates. O blossom, blossom, wandering down the track, Alone, uncherished, wilt thou not turn back? Thou know'st not yet how dark it is alack! Within that vault thy purpose meditates. By every English rose of thee a part Pause maiden, slaughter not thy young fair heart: Yea, drop from thy white hand the priest-forged dart; Lo! rose-like love thy being renovates. By every English woman glad and strong Hear thou the swift notes of an English song: Do not thy white soul this unfathomed wrong: Do England's soul no wrong; heed not these baits. The great white soul of England calleth thee: In every white wave of the thundering sea Its mandate sounds; it sounds again through me; Pause, ere thine hand thine own soul dissipates. Pause, Gertrude; by thine own dear English name That burns our hearts with longing like a flame Do not thy soul and England's soul this shame: Pause, ere thy fall our foemen's craving sates. A WHITE ROSE IN NOVEMBER. I thought it was summer when I saw the white rose! Oh can it be November, when so bright a blossom glows? The tender blossom-maiden I place within my song, To bloom therein, and smile therein, the whole year long! It cannot be November, it must be tender June: The birds amid the tree-tops will wake and whisper soon: The seas, blue-bright for summer, will chant their chorus strong And flowers will crown our foreheads, the glad year long! Oh summer ever reaches us, if but a summermaid, Sweet June wreathed in her tresses, gold August in each braid, Smiles, laughs; if but her accents, so silver-sweet and clear, Bring all the songs of spring-time, yea, every throstle, near. I knew it was summer when I saw the white rose! Through not another blossom so sweet a beauty glows; I know not any blossom so tender-sweet and white, Though many blossoms richer have flamed upon my sight. It always must be summer when the white rose sings, With music in her outspread sun-seeking petalwings! It always must be summer where the white rose gleams, For summer's self pursues her and glitters in her dreams. O white rose, white rose, soon you will be far From England and my singing; but watch some clear glad star That shineth over England above the Indian sea And send your love, soft, star-like, by that glad star to me. O white rose, white rose, soon you will be wed, And all our days of laughter and singing will be dead; But white rose, white rose, take my kiss away Hid soft amid your petals, and therein let it stay! Hid sweet amid your petals; oh therein let it rest, White rose, white rose, as in a scented nest Of young soft blessed fragrance; and when you watch the foam That breaks o'er Indian sand-banks, wave hands to me at home! Nov. 16, 1878. TO CHRIST. Have we not garlands in these latter days Whether of gold or rosebuds or of baysâ Have we not fitting joys and loves to treasureâ Snow-stars of winter, green light spring-tide sprays, Passion with heart-throbs tender beyond measure; Friendship of manhood, woman's love and praise? Have we not white seas beating round our shores And in our ironbound creeks the throb of oars? Have we not all the early summer sweetness Of morning, and delight that even pours Upon us at the burning day's completenessâ And the same sunset's cloud-built golden doors? What is there wanting? Are the skies not gold? The clouds not tipped with crimson as of old? Is the gold hair of women grown less ampleâ The fire of love a worn-out thing and coldâ Yea, do the heavy-footed centuries trample All that humanity would clasp, enfold? May we not mark within our own grey sea Tints fairer than o' the lake of Galilee? Is any flower than the English rose more splendid? Are women than our women more divine? Are sweeter sprays and goldener extended In Jewish fields than English lush woodbine? Can we not meet the high God face to face, Yea, pant and wrestle for his pure embrace? Oh, what have we to do with legends devious On whose clear brows the English God hath shone? Why bind our souls by lore of ages previousâ Why guide our spirits by aspirations gone? See how the sweet sun on our cliff-tops shines; Sweeter than suns that thread meandering vines; There is not any greater God or purer Than the strong God within the soul of each: Nor God-inspired majestic record surer Than the long centuries of English speech. Lo! in the gathered voice of English song Is God, than Gods of Jewish speech more strong, Than all the Hellenic oracles supremer, Than Christ's own crown and spirit more divine: England rise up! thou slow of heart, thou dreamer! Lo! here is God, and not in Palestine! Lo! here to-day the high God stands before Thy face O England and his feet thy floor Impress, and he within thy blue waves singeth And on the green slopes of thy thousand hills: Be blind no more,âsee all the bloom he bringeth, Mark how his endless hand thy summer fills. Traitor thou art: yea traitor to thy Lord, And murderer of thy God with foolish sword: He stands before thee, and thou dost not know him But wanderest in the Palestinian vales; Yea, blind, inane and vain, thou dost forego him And Eastward spreadest soulless fatuous sails. Traitor thou art, O England! rise up now And gaze towards thine own sky with fearless brow: Hear thou within the music of thy waters The many-voiced fair psalm of God thy king; Mark in the flower-sweet white forms of thy daughters The fairest blossoms that the ages bring. Christ's voice was sweet, but sweeter is thine own O England, and a loftier seat thy throne Than his throne; O Lord Christ shalt thou for ever Rule with thine alien sceptre young great lands? Shall these rise up full-grown, defiant, never? Is there no foot against thy foot that stands? Yea, I stand forth to-day in England's name And through my song upon my fellows shame I cry in that they spread not fearless pinions, And haply so transcend thee in the air, Reaching auguster spirit-high dominions, Finding a Father's bosom yet more fair! A tenderer Mother-God in star-strewn night, A kinglier Father-God within the bright Abode of day; king Christ, thou art usurper Of English hearts! thy crown shall pass away, Thy chant be but as tongue of linnet-chirper To future nightingales' full-voicÃ¨d lay. The age advances: lo! the white waves break With thunder upon thunder, and they take The trembling shore by inches; art thou stable When all life's sands and rocks are insecure? Thine empire rotten, and thy creed a fable, Shalt thou, the unsuccessful prince, endure? Successful art thou, and triumphant, king! Victorious and snow-white thine outspread wing! But not victorious as the priests who crown thee, Victorious only through the simple soul: In waves of blood these friends of thine would drown thee, And tides of blood above thy followers roll. The soul of man is thine; and thine own town: Jerusalem thou hast for seal and crown, But not the towers of ours the Western nations, Yea, not the roses of our English fields! Offerings of Easterns, sacrifice, oblations, But not the corn the white chalk-cliff-top yields. Thou hast for handmaids English maidens frail Who turned at thy presumptuous coming pale, Forsook their English lover-souls and gave thee What feeble power of passion-joy they knew: Thou hast not, nor shouldst have from hell to save thee, One great soul of one English woman true. Rest thou content with glances dark and hold Thine hand from meddling with bright locks of gold: Test not the Northern heart or Northern weather But dwell thou in thy balmy Palestine, Thine olive-skinned lithe loves and thou together, Thou hast no rule where English grey eyes shine.</field>
