      <field name="fulltext">A Dialogue betweene the Author and his Muse, as touching the dedication of this booke. The first characters of lines 1–3 and first four of line 4 of the first stanza and the first characters of lines 1–4 and first three of line 5 of the second stanza form an acrostic Authour My freendly Muse leaue Parnas hill a while, I craue thy ayde and counsayle now at neede: Lend mee thy laurel crown to guiue my stile, DRED drives my minde to doubt of lucky speed May I be bold this rude booke to addres, To her who is a Mirror of worthinesse. Muse. Blush not at all (thou dastard) in this case, Vnto the best, best welcome is goodwill, Refrayne thy doubtes, and hope for fauours grace, Giue mee the charge to rule thy rusty quill: LEY all thy care vpon her curtesie: Whose noble hart knowes all humanity. Authour Thy wordes (my Muse) some hope of hap doth yeeld, But yet I feele a conflict in my brest: And whether part may win in mee the feelde, My staggering doubt vncertayne yet doth rest: Before mine eyes a platforme doth appeare, Of all her worthynesse as thou shalt heare. If learning may lifte vp her fame to skies, Her laude is sent vnto the highest throne: If vertue vaunt, a lofte hir honor flies, In godlines hir like is rarely knowne, For noble nature, and for curtesie, What should I say, my pen cannot descry. May I not then bee ouer saucy deemd, To make a match as this so far vnfit. May I haue hope my booke to bee esteemd, That shewes not forth one dramme of skill ne wit: Nay, nay, my Muse, I am resolude in minde: My vndeserts, shall slender fauour finde. Muse Ah simple sot, I cannot choose but smile, To see how thou doost maske in follies net: Thou seemst abashed of thy homely stile, Lear ne this of mee, and doo it not forget, Where learned skill her golden gyftes doo place: Good will vnlearned shall finde fauours grace. Where vertue keepes possession of the brest, And godlinesse doth harbour in the hart, Scorne is exylde, shee doth disdaine detest, From noble nature, fauour doth not start. Shun not to shew the fruites of thy good will, No shame ensues where meaning is not yll. The simple beast that feares the Lious lookes, Is flesht at length by fauour once obtaynde: Though (as thou sayst) vnskilfull bee thy bookes, Yet thou ere this hast fauours freendship gainde. Her noble spouse, thy booke did not disdayne, While in thy brest like skirmish did remaine. Where Milde is first, Rede then what doth ensue, Milde mindes are alwayes matcht with curtesie: Dread not at all, shee will vouchsafe to vew Thy booke if thou approche with modesty, No tricke of loue or Venus wanton toyes, Are herein pend, to feede fonde louers ioyes. If coy conceit of curious eloquence, Had fixed foote within her learned minde: Then were it time for thee to fly from hence, To hunt for termes that hardly thou maist finde. But why doo I, to thee this lesson tell, Shee is none such, and that thou knowest full well. Then on I goe, God sende mee lucky speede, In humble wise, to craue her fauours grace: Adew dispaire, on hope my hart shall feede, With full assurance of her freendly face. And this I vow, and shall perfourme the same, In prayer to recorde her noble name. While life doth last. To the Right noble and vertuous Lady, the Lady Mildred Burleigh, VVife vnto the right honorable Lorde Treasorer of England, Vlpian Fulwell wisheth perfect Felicitie. To the Freendly Reader, Ulpian Full Well. A discription of the seuen liberall Sciences, into whose company the eight hath intruded her selfe. Grammer. If learning may delight thy youthfull brest If tender yeares to skilfull lore bee bent Approche to mee, voutchsafe to bee my guest: My entertaynement shall thy minde content. My key in hand shall ope the gate of skill, My Booke on brest shall teach thy tongue and quill. Logick. From Grammers Schoole approch to mee with speede, Where thou maist learne the rule to reason right, I geue the fruit, though Grammer sow the seede: In mee thou maist decerne the darke from light. My fastened fist much matter doth import, Coucht in few wordes fit for the learned sort. Rethorick. When Grammers grace, and Logickes learned lore, Hath deckt thy minde, and mended nature well, My golden study shall yeeld thee such store, Of flowing wordes and phrases that excell. Lo here with open hand I do display, The flowing flood of eloquence alway. Musick. When mistie clowde of drouping dumpish head Doth driue thy minde to plunge in pensiue poole, The clog of care that soking sorowes bread, Is cleane shakte of, by entring to my Schoole. My dainty tunes do yeeld such sugred sap, As drawes ech blisse, and driues eche foule mishap. Arrithmetick. By Sciphering Science, lo my summes I cast, By wit and weight, I wonderous thinges contriue, With bunch of keyes, my counts are lockt vp fast: In mee thou maist see how thy wealth doth thriue. My armes and brest, my legs eke naked bee, To shew that trueth and plainenesse rests in mee. Astronomy. From earthly skill vnto the lofty skies, My globe and I, will shew the lore of light Thou shalt foresee what tempest will arise, To thee such secrets shall appeare in sight. That Starres and Planets shall thy mates remain, And thou a fellow with celestiall traine. Geometry. Beholde the Compasse and the other tooles, Wherwith I worke such wonders as seeme straunge, My Rule and Quadrant, are no bookes for fooles, A learned scull must in my precepts range. Now when thou hast vs Sisters seauen obtainde. A worlde of wealth and wisdome thou hast gainde. Adulatior, or flatterie. Beholde the bragges that Sisters seauen haue made, Suruiew their vaunts that seeme to shine so bright My glittering skill shall clips them in the shade: In mee appeares the beames of perfect light. My flattering tongue shall gaine more then they all, I geue the trip and they shall take the fall. Grammarians gaine nought els but bread and cheese, Perchance dame Logick haue a small reward, Nete Eloquence will pleade for slender fees: Nice Musick as a Minstrel men regard. Arrithmatick obtaines but litle thrift, Astronomy serues for a simple shift. Geometrie may iog on barrels bun, And drinke the dregs when liquor al is spent, My golden Art the game and gole hath won: To my sweete skill, eche hart and eare is bent. The Well of wealth my Science doth contriue, Then learne my lore all ye that meane to thriue. To mee doth flow the flood of happy state, In mee is matcht a masse of worldly blisse, No sturdy storme my fauour may abate: For Princely cares my presence may not misse. I spin the threed and weaue the web of hap, And none but I may sit in Fortunes lap. The first Dialogue betweene the Author and the Printer. The introductory stanza only has been included. Fvll well I do finde, that Fortune is blinde, her wheele runnes by chaunce: VVhen shee list to frown, the wise she throwes downe, and fooles doth aduaunce. The seconde Dialogue betweene the Author, and Lady Fortune. The introductory stanza only has been included. Haphazard dame Fortune, your wheele runnes to fast, You lifte vp a foole, and a wiseman downe cast. Fulwels farewell vnto dame Fortune. Farewell thou froward frowning dame, the fautor still of fooles: I list not learne thy fawning loare, I loth thy flattering schooles: For tract of time by tryed truth, shall turne thy whirlinge wheele, And throw him from thy tickle top, to tomble at thy heele. My dreary date shall driue the line, to Atrops fatall blade, Er I vnto thy filthy art, will frame my liuing trade: Let greedy neede make olde wiues trot, to fill their rusty hutche: Let Gnato feede his hungry panche, I list not to bee such. Let Aristippus cogging skill, the ytching eares still rub: And I with playne Diogenes, wil tumble in a Tub. Where wee with rootes wil take repast, with conscience cleare possest: Before fine fare, with tongue in mouth, quite from the heart in brest. Adew therfore thou doting dame, I do disdaine thy skill: And while I liue agaynst thy lore, I will direct my quill. Thy fruite with filthy taste is fraught, yet faire to view of eyes: Wherunder priuy poyson lurkes, and secret venime lyes. The sap is sweete and pleasant bane, yet feedes the foolish minde: Such graffes so set on rotten stockes, such fruite must yeeld by kinde, I rather choose the homely dish that holesome drinke doth holde: Then sugred wine with poyson saust, in cup of glittering golde. As thou hast alwayes scornd my state, so I doo thee disdayne: That pleasure is to dearely bought, that purchast is with payne. And glorious though thy gyftes appeare, yet tickle is the stay: And hatefull heartes pursues with grudge, thy golden giftes alway. And when thy wrinkled forehed frownes vpon the welthy wight: What sot is hee so simple then, that shewes not forth his spight. Then hee poore wretch that erst was set full nicely in thy lap: Lyes prostrate at eche Peasants foote, to wayle his wofull hap, When flud of wealth is turnd to eb, what greater greefe may bee: Two contraries extreamely plaste, doth ay full yll agree. Soo hee that hath bene finely fed with sweetenes of thy bower: Most greeuously sustaynes the chaunge, when hee castes of the sower. The meane estate, that thee contemnes, in stedfast boat doth row: The Ship in safegard most doth passe, that beares her sayles but low And for my part, I force thee not, thy frownes I can sustaine: For if thou cause my speedy fall. I fall but in the playne. This vantage then I haue by right, to vaunt where euer I goe: That I may sit and smyle at thee, that haue deceiude thee soe. But most of all I trust needes muse, that wisemen seeke thy grace: Sith troubles so attend on them that haue thy freendly face. But some can vse thee in thy kinde, whom thou hast finely fed: And are not now to learne I trow to bring a babe to bed. Let them that lyst that hazard try, and trust in thee repose: As I by thee no gaynes doo seeke, so nothing will I lose. And thus farewell, I will returne to Lady Hope agayne: And for a token I thee sende, a dotinge Figge of Spayne. FINIS. The thirde Dialogue, between the Author and a Frier. The introductory stanza only has been included. A Fox or a Frier, who fasting doth meete: Presageth yll Fortune to lie at his feete. The fourth Dialogue betweene the Author, and Fortunatus. The introductory stanza only has been included. If Fortunes grace be perfect hap, For worldlinges calles it so: Then I at last do bath in blis That earst was wrapt in wo. The fifth Dialogue, betweene Pierce Pickthanke, drunken Dickon. Dame Annat the Alewife, and the Author. The introductory stanza only has been included. Dickon. Now fill the pot Ostesse, with liquor of life, In steede of your payment, faire wordes shalbe rife. Annat. Faire words makes foles fain, the old Prouerb doth say, Such guestes are best welcome when they go away. The sixth Dialogue, betweene Diogenes, and Ulpianus. Wherein is expressed vnder the person of the Author, the simplicity of such as thinke the Courte to preferre all that flocke vnto it, which after experience had therof, is found an vnfit place for simple persons of grosse education. Diogenes. What new delight hath rapt thy mindes my tumbling tub to shun Hath franticke folly woue the web that foolish fancy spun? Doth carefull Court accoy thy minde where daungers daily dwell Diogenes was an olde Courtier.To loth the fleidish quiet lyfe that whilom lykt thee well? Expresse therfore the cause to mee whom freendship driues to doubts Least thou bee causer of thy woe by seekinge Fortune out. Whose coy conceites I saw still well while I in Court abode Wherby my olde delight renewde to live in feeldes abrode. When Alexander mighty king, in Micedon did rayne Hee wonne mee to Dame Fortunes Court by lure of pleasant traine Where I might vew the vayne delightes that vaded euery day I saw and smilde how some still gapte for gayne of golden pray. Which was in deede a harmefull hooke, with pleasant poysoned bayt: For beeing had spight spurnd a pace, on his downefall to wayte. On fauour alwaye did attende with fayned freendly face The flatterer with cap and knee to sue for Fortunes grace. But secret spight stoode still aloofe, to hatch his hatefull broode. Enuy pursueth promotion.And open malice kept a coyle, with mad and ragyng moode. These and a thousand troubles more in Fortunes Courte I viewde I lothde to drinke those pleasant dregges that danger daily brewde. At last as I lay on my Couche a silly mouse I saw That crept out of her homly neast to feede her hungry maw. And having fed, shee tournd agayne with well contented minde Which lesson was a lore to mee, from courtlyke state to winde. Then to my Tub I turne agayne, where I am lorde and Kinge, A Castell meete for such a Prince wherto I closely clinge. My homly house no eye sore is, my landes none doth desire Diogenes vsed a Tub in steede of his house. My fall no man seekes for my wealth I hange not by the brier. And thus I dare be bolde to speake, as trueth shall offer cause: And yet I liue in safeties seat free from the tyrants lawes. Wherfore friend Fulwell leaue thy gad and liue with mee in rest: No lyfe is like a quiet hart lodgde in contented brest. Vlpianus. No new delight of courtly ioyes hath drawne mee from thy loue, Ne sugred band of Fortunes toyes may once my minde remoue: To learne experience was the cause that I from thee did wend, Skill is a poole thats bottomles, and Wisedome hath no end. Insaciable knowledge is a burning quenchlesse fire: The more experience geues mee drinke the more I still desire, Knowledge is vnsaciable. How ofte hast thou with scornefull tongue, Dame Fortunes name exprest: Which made me long to se the wight, whom thou dost so detest. That I might say by sight of eye, as else by hearesayes talke, That Fortune is a vadinge flower, a withered fruitlesse stalke. This, this I say sent mee to Court where I might see and learne, To know the dusty, chaffe from corne, and good from yll discerne, There saw I wonders very straunge, that asketh time to tell, They thinke there is no other Heauen that ay hath bene in Hell. When thou an I in whelmed Tub, from stormes in couert lay, I thought no harbour like to that, for night and rainy day. Our rootes mee semde was sweete repast, and iunkets passinge fine: For hunger is a noble sauce, and thirst makes water wine: A wodden dish is worthy plate, where mettals are vnknowne: In steede of goblet, nature gaue vs handes that are our owne. But when I came to courtly trayne, then might my eyes beholde: Such buyldings braue, such costly robes, such plate of glittering gold Such gems and iewels of great price, such fashions of atyre: Such flaunting Dames whose beautye braue, would kindle Cupids fier, Such iustling to beare swing and sway, such clyming to the top, Note. And some I saw did reape the corne, that neuer sowde the crop. Diogenes. And might not these enflame thy minde, in courty troupe to stay? Vlpianus. No no, but lende thy eares a while and so shall I display. The cause that I am far unfit, to serue in Fortunes traine: Wherby my fates inforceth mee to clownish fleid agayne. As kinde forbids the Larke to swim, and fishe to fly in ayre: So I in Court deuoyde of hope, may liue in deepe despaire. When first I came to Fortunes Court, with hope of happy speede, A hungrye plague to see meate and drinke &amp; yet to starue.I saw the fruite like Tantalus, but might not theron feede. I smeld the rost, but felt no taste, my hunger to augment: I might beholde the fragrant Wines, and follow by the sent. I saw the Ladyes gallant gownes with many a garde and dente, And Courtiers for their Ladies sakes in costly colours went, The fashion of my thread bare robes, no Courtier did desire: But eche one sayd a ragged Colte may serue a scabbed squire. And thus I kilde a Courtier then for courting any more: I saw the snare and scapte the trayne, and hauing learnd this lore. I can exhort my compires now, that are for Court vnapt, To leaue the life thats linkt in care, with troubles daily wrapt. Diogenes. Then shew I pray the what thou sawest, and what thou didst obserue: Tis longe since I of Court had vew, and courtly fashions swerue, Declare to mee how lusty lads Dame Fortunes grace doth win: Prepare thy tonge, my eares are bent to heare thy tale begin. Vlpianus. To shew of Robes the sundry sutes and fashions very straunge: Would bee to tedious to describe for why they daily change And what was vsde but last yeare past, is now so olde and stale: That country clownes do buy them now in Courte they haue no sale. A merye world for Taylors.And that which now in Court is worne, growes daily out of vre: The Taylor that can make new guise, of currant coyne is sure, But this I cheefely did obserue, Frenchmen haue framde such tooles That now french Nets are cast on neckes to catch vp English fooles. French Nets are to catch English fooles.But let it passe I spurne it not, let each one vse their vaine: These vanities I will omit, and turne my tale agayne. Unto the wonders that I saw, by practise put in vse: But first to honest Courtiers I will frame my iust excuse. Whom I doo not in any poynt meane to offend at all: Though galbackt Bayard winch when hee is rubbed on the gall, I saw where Aristippus stoode, fast by a Lordinges side: Aristippus was a good Courtier.Who in his taunting tatlinge tonge reposde a iolly pride. Hee finely framde his fyled talke, the hearers to delight Smooth wordes I see both beare great sway and are of mickle might. Eche man salutes him by his name, and hee doth them imbrace: Wordes are good cheape, and tis small cost to shew a frendly face, His new found science in the Court, did truth of times betray: And who but Aristippians might beare the bell away. At last hee mee espyde by chaunce, and thus to mee gan say: What? old acquaintance? what affaires hath the to court now brought What winde driue thee? and whats the cause? that thou the court hast sought Some men call this, holy water of the Court. If any thing in mee doth rest, that may thy fancy feede: Expresse thy minde, aske and receiue, but speake and thou shalt speede, I gaue him thankes, but yet I thought these goodly golden wordes Would prooue but winde of slender weight, &amp; bushes voyd of burds: I calde to minde an olde sayd saw, which I haue not forgot: Tis wisedome to take time in time, and strike while thyron is whot. When Pig is proferd, ope the poke, my Nurse taught me that tricke: My poke was open by and by, my hammer was very quicke. Faire sir (quod I) your freendly wordes emboldeneth mee to craue That I (through you) in Fortunes court some simple place may haue. Small entertaynment serues my turne, so it be ought at all: Poore men are pleasde with Potage aye, till better vittailes fall, And you that earst was as I am, sit now in Fortunes lap: Make freendes of Fortune while you may: men say shee hath a trap, Wherin her darlings oft times falles, when frowning cheare begins, Fortunes giftes eb and flovv. First poynt of hawking is holde fast, hee laughes they say that wins, Tush tush (quod hee) thou witles wight, thou spendest winde in waste: First learne the skill to flatter fine, and then thou maist bee plaste. Diogenes that doringe drudge hath drawne thee to his schoole, His preignant wit is yll applyde, hee proues himselfe a foole. Hee calles mee Dionisius dog, for fawning flattery fine, But hee like dogge doth snar and grinne at this wise trade of mine. If hee would turne his taunts and quips, to pleasant mery iest, Hee might in fauoures grace remaine, and flaunt it with the best. So thou that yet hast not shakte of, that sottish kinde of skill: Must smooth thy tongue, and oyle thy wordes, and finely file thy quill: Then come to Court, and I protest thou shalt haue my good will. Ah sir (quoth I) I see right well my sute growes very colde, All promises are not perfourmde, all glistering is not golde. And wordes of course haue course effect, experience teacheth so: Deedes sinke, and lye at lowest ebbe, while golden wordes do flowe. And sith no meane but flattery may saue mee from Fortunes scornes: As good a foe that hurteth not, as a freende that helpeth not. I list not seeke a pleasant rose, among so many thornes. As good such freendes were lost as found that helpeth not at neede: Of thousand losses tis the least, thus wee were soone agreede. Diogenes. Ah sir, and sawest thou Aristip, that spaniell of curres kinde? Who hunts eche haunt where gayne doth grow and turneth with the winde A smelfeast Gnato for his gut to vouch each Thrasos bragge: Whose wordes are free to promise much, but bound vp in his bagge: His filthy foule Philosophy more frendship hath obtaynde, Then truthfull tongue and trusty harte that neuer was distaynd. Much like the false and wily Fox, that whilom hath espide A Rauen with her pray in mouth, whereat the Fox enuide. The Foxes flattering Oration to the Rauen.And cast within his crafty minde, how hee might her beguile: From top of tree where Rauen sate, at last hee framde this wile. O noble birde whose heauenly hue, with ioyfull eyes I see: And muse that fame hath forgd such tales, and foule vntruthes of thee For flying fame, nay, lying fame, reportes thee to bee blacke: But sure I see thy stately corpes, no beauty braue doth lacke. The lofty oke thou makste thy pertch, the hauty towre thy seate: Thy mighty winges with princely pompe, the fleggy ayre doth beate. Thy port doth passe the Eagles lookes, I know full well thy kinde: A good Orator.Thy race is sure heroicall, thou art of noble minde. And if thy songe bee like thy shape, the beastes would sure reioyce: To see that comely corpes of thine, and heare so sweet a voyce. The Rauen then puft vp with pride, her prayses to augment: Began to singe, the pray fell downe, the Fox had his intent, And laught to scorne the foolish birde, that thought her selfe so braue: Euen so playes flatterers when they catch the things that they would haue But now proceede, what sawest thou els, it is no newfound cast: Tis common now for fooles to feede, when wiser men do fast. Vlpianus. If I should shew what sleights I saw, dame Fortunes grace to gayn, Would try my wittes and mee procure, displeasure for my payne. Diogenes Hast thou such feare of Fortunes frownes or of her whirling wheele? Who since thou were three horseloues high hast tumbled at her heele? Dread not at all except thou meane, to learne her fawning skill: Whose flattering cup is filde with wine that thirst enforceth still. Vlpianus. Nay, nay, tis time that wee go in, to take some small repast My limmes wax weake, my tongue is faynt, Pigges are content with mast, The Courtly fare hath fed my eyes, but belly had no share: Nothing at all no sauour hath, nothing is homly fare: I know thy storehouse is not voyde, of rootes or some such dish. Sharpe hunger is a noble sauce, for rootes, for flesh or fishe. Diogenes. Yet tell I pray thee, foundst thou not one faythful freende at all: Wherby some hope of better hap in time to thee might fall. Yl is his chaunce, worse is that place where freendship none is found, Vlpianus. Yes verely one freend I had to whom I am much bound. Diogenes. But was hee of hability, by Fortunes fawning grace? Vlpianus. Dame vertue gaue him worships seat, in spight of Fortunes face. Diogenes. Fayne would I know that freendly wight, I longe to heare his name Vlpianus. Some men would deeme I flatter him, if I should write his fame. Diogenes. Truth may bee blamd but neuer shamd, Truth needes not feare her fo In truthfull prayse a man may speake, Truth needes no glosing sho. A lying flatterer ay is forste his forged tale to hyde, With cloake of fayned eloquence, for feare hee bee espyde. But why shouldest thou retrayne to speake: the truth that thou haste tride. Wherfore thou maist impart to mee his name and worthinesse: Vlpianus. Then marke my wordes, and couertly the same I will expresse, Ernest hee is in zeale of sacred trueth, Debonaire eke, and freend to euery wight: A faythfull freend to the Author. Modest and meeke, a father vnto youth, Vertue to further is his whole delight. No nigard of the wealth that God him sent, Despising pride, and with his state content. His hart doth harbour giftes of heauenly grace, Among the poore a patron of defence: Right louingly doth learned wightes embrace, Makes small account of curraunt quoyned pence, A pacient man in suffring any wrong, Not rendring yll agayne in deede nor tonge: Diogenes Ful well I now perceiue his name, and haue obserude his praise: Such freendes in whom such vertues are be rare in these our dayes. The seuenth Dialogue, betweene Tom Tapster, Miles makeshift, VVat VVily, and the Author. The introductory stanza only has been included. Tom Tapster. You are welcom gentlem? wil it please you to go neare. Author. Such welcome I like not that bought is to deare. [O mighty loue sith licence thine to speake is now assignde] O mighty loue sith licence thine to speake is now assignde, And pardon free proclaimde, giue leaue for mee to speake my minde, Fooles boltes (men say) are soonest shot yet ofte they hit the marke: Blinde Bayard is as sure of foote as Palfrey in the darke. On Stage who stands to play his part ech frown may not him daunt Some play to please, some laugh, some wepe, some flatter, some do ta?t But hee whose parte tendes to this ende, fond fansies toyes to school: Best welcome is when hee resines, the Scaffold to the foole. Lo now the foole is come in place, though not with patcht pyde coate, To tell such newes as esrt hee saw within Cocklorels bote. The Rowers cryde, to Barge to Barge, the passengers make haste: The tyde is turnde, and euery foole in his degree is plast. With lusty gaole and laboring Oars the Barge hath won the Porte Where Iupiter doth raigne and rule, within a stately Forte. Eche one deuisde which way were best in fauoures grace to grow: Some crake, some brag, some flaunt it out, some crouch and creepe ful low With cap and knee some sue &amp; serue, some gape for others falles Some snatch the fruit before rebound, some gnaw on tastlesse shalles. Some fish and catch a Frog at last yet feede on better hope: Some sting their handes with nettles keene, while they for flowers grope Some sing some daunce, some pype, some play, &amp; al for fauours grace: Thus greedy gayne makes men beleeue, they runne in endlesse race, What desperate hazard is so hard, that makes the yonker doubt, What way so wilde where gaine doth grow, that worldling findes not out What hole so small in writings olde, that cannot be now found: But lucre &amp; large c?science makes some holes where wordes be found Ah, Conscience is a banisht wight, with garment al to torne? But though shee sit in homly ragges, she laughes some robes to scorne Shee smiles at tyrants that turmoyle to make their will a law: Whose climbing mindes by right or wrong, would hold all men in aw. Refusing fame and chusing shame, by hunting Mammons chace: A fig (say they) for good report, let mee haue Fortunes grace. Oh Ioue, are these things hid from thee, nay, nay, thou seest them all: But winking wisdome is not blinde to turne the tossed ball. Thou seest that sundry sortes of men, by flattery do aspire: To guerdon great, when trusty trueth hath hatred for her hyre, Thou seest I know the subtile sleights that worldly wightes deuise: Who currieth fauour currantly, is onely counted wise. Alas how is Religion vsde to serue the turne at neede: Whose cloake hides sundry hypocrites that many errours breede? For why tis now a common trade, when refuge all is past: To take Religion for a shield, a shift to serue at last. Oh Ioue if thou wilt ransacke some that vaunt of her decrees They will appeare but flauntinge leaues of withered fruitlesse trees, To flatter Princes many men, apply them to the time: They force no whit Religions fall, so they aloft may clime. Now mighty Ioue, looke well about all thinges are in thy sight: The Touchstone tries, all is not golde, that glistereth faire &amp; bright: Loe, thus I haue exprest my minde, and shewd forth my intent, My part is playd, and I am plasde so that I bee not shent. Tom Tapsters Lecture. As flying fame with golden trompe, hath sent thy brute abrode: So bounden duety by deserts bids mee my minde vnloade. Thy hauty porte, thy heauenly gifts, thy line of noble race: Thy passinge prayse, the happy state makes all men ioy thy case. As one who for his countryes wealth, by fate was first ordaynde: Oh happy soyle whose lucky lot so rare a gem hath gaynd. But whether are our ioyes more great, in hauinge such a wight: Or els our greefe when sisters three, shall worke their yreful spight. And as both Heauen and earth are bent thy honour to procure, So prudence thine (O noble Lord) must cause the same endure: But by thy leaue (O maister mine,) I see and sighe withall: That bounty should beare such asway, as to procure thy fall. For thou (my Lorde) with princely pompe thy table doost maintayne, A freend to all saue to thy selfe, but how may this remayne. Thy purse is open to the poore, their naked lymmes to cloake: Like Lords thy tennants liue at ease free from all seruill yoake. If in the ende thy state decay, eche man bewayles the case, Take time, in time, so feareles thou maist spit in Fortunes face, And to begin, first cut thy troupe, and trayne of seruing men, Where two or three may serue the turne, what shouldst thou doo with ten? But ten times ten on you depend and by your purse maintaind: Leaue of my Lord, as good as you that pompe hath now refraind. Imploy the Court with dilligence in presence of the Prince: Whence profit growes, &amp; fauour springs though mumbling lobcocks wince. Breake vp housekeeping &amp; your troup, geue pasportes to your traine In Court two wayters and a Page will serue while you remayne. Agayne in Court such cheats do chance as causeth gaine to grow: What neede I name the order how sith you your selfe do know, If neede require that you appeare in presence of the king: when as it shall expected bee, that you a trayne must bring. Your tennants are good hansome hines, when badged blew cates on, A warme seruise I warrant youSo may you muster lustely with Simkin, Hob and Iohn. And hee poore swad, will willingly, on cote bestow the cost: His best cart horse will make good shifte, to ride with you in poste. And were not these things better saued, then prodigally spent Though you spend all, yet clownish crew, will neuer bee content: And when continuance in the Court do breed desire of change. With Haukes and Spaniels then you may about the country range. Now here, now there, among your freendes how will you entertayne: Plaine cuntry houses sumtimes hath in store, so y? you bring no trayn: The Diuell sendeth such counsaylors.Mas parson sumtimes serues, a Capon or some such: Pinch on the parsons side my Lorde, the whorsons haue to much. And when you list to lye at ease, goe to some proper towne: So shall you not bee charged oft to feede Sim swad the clowne. Your stable then your owne turne serues, your stable may bee small, Few dishes fraught with littel meate, to fill thee boarde withall I trow your tennants will prouide, both Capon, Pig, and goose: Beare them in hand their coppies naught and that the lease is loose. So shall you haue prouision brought, to serue you all the yeare. Yea sir, let tennants loke to that for markets now be deare. And though your noble auncetors were cleane voyde of the skill: That doth belong to husbandry, the greedy barne to fill. Yet shun not you the trade to know, that yeeldeth treble gayne: Nothing seemes hard to prudent men, where gaine requites the paine. The more your knowledge doth excell the grater is your prayse: Who knowes of land to make the most, is wisest now adayes. When graue and prudent men are set, at table to their meate: Their table talke tends to this ende, of husbandry to treat. By meanes wherof no toyling Hine, that plowes and tilles the fielde Can better tell then noble men, what gayne a plough will yeelde, What neede the Grasser you beguile, in hyringe of your ground: When you your selfe may plainly see what gayne doth thence redound Why should the butcher gayne the Hide, in bying of a beefe: This knowledge now in noble men doth chuse the farmers greefe. Learne, learne (my Lorde) of landlords now to let thinges to the best: Tis well when tennants crouch and creepe, to fill the landlordes chest. The Tapster hath a flinge at Cotsol men.Your shepeheard is a subtill knaue, and breeds himselfe a stocke: By keeping many sheepe of his among your Lordships flocke. Also you haue the Patronadge and gifte of goodly Tithes: With faire globe lands in haruest time, that tryes the Mowers sithes Which to bestow on prating priestes, for tellinge of a tale: Is madnes meere, but rather you may set them out to sale. Sir Simon is a lusty lad and hath good store of golde, But set a price and doubt you not the mony is soone tolde. And if hee thinke it very much, to giue so large a fine: Then may you choose a simple sot? who easely will incline, To bee your drudge at all assayes? and feede among the swine. Who will be glad with portion small although the fruites bee much, Poore men with pottage are well pleasd, such fellowes wil not grutch. What though hee bee no Preacher sir, haue you no care for that: Hee hath a prety skill to dig and delue a garden plat. These precepts if your Lordship marke, and put thesame in vre: Then Fortune shall be at your becke and stoupe vnto your lure, Loe thus (my Lord) I make an ende and wish you happy dayes. To bath in blisse, to swim in ioy, to win immortall prayse. A short Dialogue, betweene the Authour and his booke, wherin is shewed sundry opinions that were vttered of the first Impression of this booke, which the Authour him selfe hearde in Paules Church yeard. and else where. Author. What loytring cause or lingring let, Hath helde thee from my handes so long Or elss hast thou such checke mates met, As by some meanes hath done thee wrong Some newes hath chaunst, I know full well, If good or bad? I pray thee tell. Booke. Such newes perhaps, I haue to show, As vneth will thy minde content: If talke may make mennes eares to glow, I muse if thine be not quite spent, A thousand tongues doo speake of thee, Thou hast so fondly framed mee. This is a new found arte, say they, Pickte out of late from ydle brayne: But some agaynst those wordes inuey, And say thou tookst an honest payne, By mery meane thus to detect: The folly of the flattering sect. Some like thy verse, but not thy proes, Some prayse thy minde, but not thy skill: Some shew them selues to bee thy foes, By mocking thee, and eke thy quill, Some say thou hast a litle wit, But doost apply the same vnfit. Some say that in times past, In Flatteries Schoole thou hast been traynde: And yet to thriue foundst not the cast, For Fortune aye thy state disdaind: And now thou takst as weapon stronge, Thy pen for to auenge that wrong. And thus as I haue raunged abrode, I heare the verdictes of them all: Some rage and rayle, some lay on lode. Belike they were rubde on the gall. Some smyle to see so quaint a toy, Some laugh right out, and some looke coy. Author. Ah sily booke, that thus hast past, Amid thy freends, and through thy foes, VVhat writer euer found the cast, To please all men? none I suppose, For fancy comes to men by fittes, So many heads, so many wittes. Sith sundry men in sundry wise, Do shoote their sentence at my name: Goe tell them all, that I despise, The scoffes that taunting tongues do frame, Thy humble duety do expresse, To thy right noble patronesse, Then reuerently thy selfe submit, Vnto the troupe of learned trayne: As for fooles boltes, that would thee hitte, Thou shalt full well their shot sustayne. And say to them, that thee doo blame, My Author prayse you mend the same. So shall you answere his desire, And haue his thankes, a small rewarde, Els let your tongue from taunts retire, Yll tongues good matters, ofte hath marde, A fault is sooner found, then mended, Few bookes by finde faulte is defended. Farewell my booke, God bee thy speede, I sende thee forth to walke alone: In homly stile, a threede bare weede, For robe of Rethorike I haue none, My VVaredrope hath no filed phrase, VVheron fine eyes delight to gase. FINIS. The eyghth Dialogue, betweene Sir Symon the Parson of Poll Iobbam, and the Authour. The introductory stanza only has been included. VVho liues to learne, and learnes to liue And list to come to thrift, May see the skill, and finde the way, By my new founded shrift. FINIS.</field>
