      <field name="fulltext">The firste Chapter. A misticall songe of the spirituall and godly loue, betwene Christ the spouse, and the churche or congregacion his spousesse. i The Churche vnto Christ. The Argument of the first song. The Church Christes Spouse, deliuered from the corrupt kisses of fleshly pleasures and delytes, &amp; rid fr? y? vain wurkes of men in which she long time trusted, hauing tasted of the pure fountayn of gods aboundant loue and mercy, is so inflamed through fayth to loue Christe &amp; his merites, that humbling herselfe she despiseth her former forein righteousnes: &amp; rauished with earnest affeccion (like a very feruent louer) desyreth the loue of her beloued: singing to hym in the audience of her maydens, the congregacion of young beleuers, as foloweth. O that my loue whome onely I desyre, Which hath me brought from vayne to perfit blisse To perfect fayth, from wurkes of worldly myer: Would with his mouth witsafe his Spouse to kisse. The Gene. xxix. ii. Kin. xiiii. ii. Cor. xiii. Luke. vii. and xxii. Kisse o Christe, which I of thee require Thy grace, thy peace, thy loue (my Loue it is: Whiche while I lacke, thy fathers wrath and yre, Condemnesh me for my first fathers misse. The lawe (alas) the dutie of our hyer, Skarce kept in ought, doeth styll agaynste me hisse: Wherfore o Christe who quenched hast his fyer, Through loue and grace, delyuer me from this. Whiche styl to craue the more I me encline Bycause thy Esai. lxvi. Teates, thy consolacion swete Muche better be than any kynde of wine: Furth from the whiche the oyntmentes for me mete Of truthe, of hope, of pacience diuine, With al good gyftes of the holy goste doe flete. My spouse the flesh hath dugges, but very drye Of foÅd or fruyte, saue what is very yll: From them therfore to thee my Christe I flye, Besechyng thee with thyne my lust to fyll. And thou my God suffisaunce hast alwaye For al mankynde, for euery soles relyef: Psal. xliiii.For all among that God annoynted aye, Thou wast, and art, and euer shalte be chyef. Thy name my Dear, that art aye permanent, Ryght sonne of God that ruleth ouer all. Moste wyse, Esai. ix. and xlvi. and. li. Deut. xxviii. Psalm. viii. cx. and. cxii. Prou. xviii. Phile. ii. Luke. i. moste iust, most good, omnipotent, Whiche wast at fyrst and dure for euer shal, This thy name is an oyntment poured furth, Of power to saue al that theron doe cal. Thou art our sauiour Christ, the kyng of wurth Hebre. ii.That doest redeme vs from our fathers fal. Thou, thou alone, with blud thy crosse besprent, By mercie hast made free vs that wer thral. This name of thyne my Loue, hath suche a sent Where preachers sheade it as it doeth behoue, That Damsels young, folke young in fayth are bent With earnest zeale thy mercy muche to loue. For whose encreace o God I doe thee pray To endue me with thy grace: and so to draw From carnal lustes, that plucke me styl away From loue of thee and kepyng of thy law: That in thy truth so earnest be I may, Of lyfe so good, in charitie not raw, That taught of me, these Younglynges may assay To wurke thy wyl, whiche earst in me they saw. ii The Younglynges to Christ. The Argument. Christe hauyng heard the louely peticion of his Spouse the church, fulfilleth her request: geuyng her the swete kysse of peace of conscience, and the oyntmentes of gyftes spirituall that runne out of his fragraunt smellyng brestes With whiche whan he hath coupled her to hym, he maketh her so glorious in fayth to hym ward, and charitie towardes all folke, that the Younglynges seyng her godly conuersacion Shynyng euerywhere, are moued the more earnestly to stick Vnto her. And therefore where as afore they wer waueryng, for fear of troubles and persecucion readier to go backe than forward, they now plucke vp a good courage: and fully bent to folow, syng vnto Christe as foloweth. The fear that kept vs long in dout Through grosnes of the flesh, Now lord alone thou driuest out, And doest our soules rifreshe. Sith then that for thy spouses sake Our weake heartes thou hast wonne: Unto the trueth we vs betake, And after thee we runne. iii The spouse to the younglinges. The Argument. Christ seeyng the readynes of the younglinges, both to folowe and runne after him, is as ready to receiue them: And therfore to thintent that they faynt not by the way, he sendeth furth his spouse to comfort &amp; encourage them. Who preaching to them the mercies of god, and benefites which she hath receyued of her beloued: syngeth very pleasauntly as foloweth. Kyng Christe (ye yong) whose loue (ye saw) I sought, Hath kissed me with his swete peace and grace. Esay. xxvi. and xxxii.He hath by fayth my troubled conscience brought To peace and rest, his pleasaunt Chamber place For whan the law that no man can fulfil, Had made me dead and could me not reuiue. Because the fleshe ful sore against my wil Mayntaynd with sinne, did stil agaynst me striue, With price of bloud, he freely bought me free, Geuing me lyfe by loue, and made me iust. His restful places, Loe ye yong, these be: Whertil he bringes al those that in him trust. iv The younglinges to Christ. The Argument. The younglynges delyted with the consolacion of the churches pleasant song, enter into the kinges chambers, from whence they rendre thankes and prayses to Christ for his benefites, synging. VVe wil reioyce and ioy in thee, O Lorde omnipotent: Whiche through thy mercy makest free Them that to trueth be bent. Thy fruteful teates that are so fyne, Thy consolacions swete, We wil remember more than wine: Whiche are for vs most mete. For fayth al onely in thy bloud In God the fathers sight, We are reputed iust and good: Where woorkes are al to light. Wherfore the yong whome thou for iust By mercy doest approue, In thee alone, put al their trust, And mearely do thee loue. v. The Churche to the Younglinges. The Argument. Because it is nedefull that al whiche wyl be partakers of the benefites and swete consolacions of Christe, muste also be partakers of his troubles and bitter affliccions: For persecucion foloweth the gospell: eyther inwardly by temptacion of the wicked deuyll, or els outwardly by the malice of his cruel ministers: therfore the Churche by example of her self warneth the Younglynges herof, syngyng as foloweth. O ye fayer Daughters of Ierusalem, Ye faythful folke whiche pleased are so wel In Christes teates in whiche there is no wem, And in his restful parlers where ye dwel: Now take good heed, and learne ye al by me In fayth to stande in stormie troubles stoute. Loe I am blacke welfauored though I be: For persecucion toucheth me without. Without I am lyke to the Gene. xxiv. Scithicke tentes, Whiche outward blacke kepe treasures hyd within: For though I be afflict with diuers dentes, No farther yet pearce they than to the skin. The peace of Christe doeth styll within me dwel, And I am lyke to ii. Paral. iii. Salomons curtin: For purple sylke, with fayth adorned wel, And with Gods spirit, in stede of Cherubin. Despise me not therfore though I be broun, In syght of men bothe abiect, vayne and vyle: For why the Malac. iiii. Luke. ii. Sunne, euen Christe hath shyned doun, And burnt my soule, whiche sinnes do sore defyle. So that my wurkes appere now through his lyght, Ful foule (God wote) the best not free from sin. Yet by his beames that shyne on me so bright I mortifie olde Adam hyd within. Why I am blacke an other cause there is: My mothers sonnes (for Eua is mother of all) Fel out with me, the cause wherof is this: I damne my wurkes, on Christes mercies I call, True fayth in Christe all only maketh me iust. Thus I beleue, wherat they all repyne, And would compel me on my wurkes to trust. Eke in theyr vines, theyr lawes to bad for swyne They haue me set, a keper for to be. Of Sathanas the Synagog they arre, A minister wherof they dyd make me: Which made me blacke, and doeth my beautie marre. They made me thinke that false hypocrisie, With ryghtles rites deuised by theyr brayne, Were able ynough my soule to iustifie: By meanes wherof, Kristes death I counted vayne. And these theyr lawes repugnant to the truth, Theyr vineyardes vile, I haue attended long. But myne owne vyne, my soule euen from my youth, I haue not kept, but euermore gone wrong. vi The Spouse to her beloued. The Argument. The yonglinges hauing heard the spouses open declaracion both of her lyfe passed, and also of her presente estate, and doubting lest they may be deceiued &amp; seduced as she before tyme had beene, because they would be sure, commit themselues to her giding &amp; custody. But y? church knowlegyng her vnablenes by her owne wit &amp; power to kepe herselfe, c?mitteth to Christ the cure of altogether. And to th?tent she be not prouoked through the subtil deceite of false doctrine, to wandre &amp; stray from the trueth, she desireth her beloued to shew her the right way where and how to finde him, synging as foloweth. O Christ my loue beloued of my soule, I know that thou delyting in the light. In mid day time, when men in fayth be hole, Doest feede and rest, through pleasure and delight. But in what place thou doest thee feede and rest. I am not sure, wherfore I thee desyre To teache me that, lest I with al the rest By wandryng wyde, defyle vs in the myre. The Churche malignant with her many mockes, To be thy felow boldly doeth her boast, And in thy name hath gathered myghty flockes: Whiche straye abrode wel nygh in euery coast. Newe foldes, new faythes, she dayly doeth diuice Her flockes to feede, wherein alas they stray: And as for thyne she counteth of no price, Fraying by force, all shepe from them away. Yet in thy name her office she doeth holde, Makyng her vaunt that she the true Church is: Enforcyng all that would be of thy folde, Suche weedes to eat, as she hath sowen amis. That I therfore lead not thy yong awrye, Nor fall among thy fayned felowes flocke, Enfourme me where thou doest thee feede and lye, O Christ my lyght, my shepherd, and my rocke. vii Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Because the Churche distrustyng her selfe, putteth her whole confidence in her Beloued, praying hym so earnestly to teache her how she may ryghtly instruct her Yo?glynges, he hauyng heard and allowed her humble peticion, maketh answer to her request, syngyng as foloweth. Yf thou the fayrest of all woman kynde, That euer I founde most faythful in dede, Doest not of thy self know where me to fynde, Except by my grace thou therto procede: Because all wisdom of flesh is to blynde To searche out the place where I lye and fede: Because I thee loue and am to thee kynde, The trueth wyl I teache thee: yf thou wylt spede, Cum furth fro thy selfe. Cum furth fro thy self, cum furth fro the darke- sum trust in thy deades, wherof all the packe That man may deuise, are not wurth a sparke Of fayth in my blud, where can be no lacke. Although that the church malignant doe barke, Cum furth from her foldes: and bear on thy backe My Lode, Crosse, and yoke, whiche shall be thy marke For her to detest, and put thee to wracke: Yet trace thou my steppes. Yet trace thou my steppes, so shalt thou be sure To gyde ryght thy yong, that long to be fed. And sith that thou hast of suche taken cure Whiche young are in truth, lyke kiddes lately bred, Fyrst feede theym with mylke, let loue theym allure: Than strength theym with fayth, (of scripture the head) By good shepheardes tentes, my wurd that is pure. Learne theym by the lyfe of Saynctes that are dead In fayth to be firme. viii Christe to his Spouse. The argument. Christe hauyng taught his Spouse where and howe to fynde hym, and after what sorte she shall instructe her Younglynges: nowe that the Younglynges maye delyte in her the more, begynneth to prayse her, not for because she hath any thyng prayse wurthy of her selfe, but for the good gyftes that he hath geuen her: whiche neuertheles he calleth hers, because he gaue her theym freelye: she confessyng also that whatsoeuer good she hath, cummeth from hym, whiche hath made her beautyfull. For whiche and many other good gyftes he wyllyng to prayse her, syngeth before the Younglynges as foloweth. Thee (o my Spouse) which doest the thinges that I requier, Which longtime strayedst wyde, to sin a captiue thrall: I lyken to myne Luke. ii. Oast, myne Angels bryght as fyer, But yockt in Pharaos cartes, the captayne principall Of hell, of hell. From whose power I thee quit so soone as faythfully Thou dydst in me beleue, and haue thee armed so With giftes of grace diuine, that except wylfully Thou yelde, not sin, nor death haue myght to wurke thee wo, Nor hel, nor hel. For why thy Chekes be fayer, I mean thyne outwarde hue, Whiche beautified by me, that am thy bodies head, Shyne lyke to the holy goste, (whiche is the turtle true) With loue, with grace and lyght, and beautie ouerspred, Full well, full well. Thy necke, that is thy fayth by whiche thou doest receyue All gyftes whiche I thee geue, as iustice, lyfe, and grace, Is lyke a golden ouche that doeth no syght deceyue, Whiche vyler thynges help not, but may it foule disgrace Ryght well, ryght well. Bycause therfore thy necke, thy perfect fayth is pure: Least with the lawes of men, thou do it foully fyle, Euen we the Trinitie wyl make thee a neckebonde sure, Beset with syluer spanges, wurkes for thy fayth not vyle, But good, but good. Good wurkes that shall procede of fayth, as humblenes Toward vs the Lorde thy God, obedience to our wyl: With loue, all suche to help as shalbe succourles. This neckebande shalt thou wear these wurkes accept we wyll For good, for good. ix. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. Scarce hath Christ finished his song, but that his Spouse accordyng to her dutie, rendereth hym thankes therefore, transcrybyng vnto hym that wurketh in her bothe the wyll and dede of all goodnes, the prayse of all her goodly beautie. And that the Younglynges whome she hath taken charge of maye knowe howe to wear the neckebande of good wurkes, whiche God hath prepared &amp; geuen her, so that her Beloued maye be pleased withall, she teacheth the Younglynges by example of herself, syngyng as foloweth. VVyle that I walkt in wurkes of mannes deuice, Thinkyng my self of power my selfe to saue, I dyd good dedes, but they wer of no price: For faulte of fayth I coulde no merit haue. But after Christe had sowed in my brest The seede of fayth, through his beneuolence: And as a Kyng had layed hym doune to rest Vpon his Couche, my quiet conscience: Than dyd my Narde, myne oyntment of belief Yelde furth the smell, the fruteful wurkes of faythe, Among the which my charitie for chief God doeth accept, and most of value wayeth. So that my Loue whome I to be doe know A bundle of Myrrhe, though bytter, yet in seint Excedyng good, and makyng all thynges slow For to corrupt, that therwithal be meint: Betwene my brestes, suche cumfort as I show To all that nede, delyteth for to dwel. Ye Christe my Loue from whom all fayth doeth flow, In me his Churche so pleasauntly doeth smell, That to my taste he is the goodly grayne Of Cypresse swete, whiche commonly doeth spryng Among the vines, the elect that do remayne In Engaddi, Gods truth, the true kyddes spryng. x. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Whan the Churche hath transcribed the glory of all her goodnes to her Beloued, and praysed hym as the Author thereof, he pleased with this her true iudgement, prayseth her therfore, syngyng agayne as foloweth. Loe thou my Loue, art fayer: Myselfe haue made thee so, Yea thou art fayer in dede, Wherefore thou shalt not nede In beautie to dispayer: For I accept thee so For fayer. For fayer, because thyne iyes Are lyke the Culuers, whyte: Whose simplenes in dede All others doe excede: Thy iudgement wholly lyes In true sence of spryte, Moste wyse. xi. The Spouse to her Beloued. The Argument. The Churche so hyghlye commended of Christe for the simplicitie of her true and vpryght iudgemente, yeldeth hym thankes agayne bothe because it pleased hym to geue it her, and also to accept it so wel in wurth: and to encorage the Younglynges to loue hym the better, she prayseth his beautie and other benefites, syngyng. Thou thou o Christe, it is that arte so fayer, YeÃ  my Beloued, most beautifull art thou: As for my borowed beautie may appayer, Whiche wer but fylth except thou it allow. But sith thou Lorde, moste fayre, moste beautiful, Imputest to me parte of thy beautie bryght, Beholde our Bed, our peace most plentiful Of conscience, doeth florish through thy myght. Our houses eke of fayth wherin we dwell, Haue sylynges fine, the scriptures truly taught, Of Cedre tree, whose euerlastyng smel Shal styll endure whan all thynges cum to naught. With these sylynges Crosse ioynters ioyned are Of Cypresse swete, a wood that wyl not rot: Good wurkes in whiche we do our fayth declare, Through lyuely loue, with death that dyeth not. Here endeth the first Chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .ii. Chapter xii. Christe to his Spouse. The argument. Christ hauyng heard his Spouse prayse him for his bewtie and fauour through whiche she was made bewtifull and obtayned the bed of peace, and house in the last song declared, calleth nowe to mynde his humanitie: whiche after he hath euidently declared, he taketh therof a new occasion to prayse his Churche, syngyng. The floure of the field am I, That springeth alone, vnset: Whome Mary brought furth fleshly, Though man dyd me not beget, Nor set. Yet am not I lyke the flower Whiche once beyng rype, doeth dye: But as the violet hath power Whose flower smelleth moste swetely, So I. The Lilie am I lykewyse, The glorious beautie bryght Of the humble, who as vallies, Ly low, doubtyng of theyr myght To ryse. These vallies among below Whome hilles set aloft, doe hyde: I Christe for the more part grow, By fayth in them I abyde, Not slow. And as I that am thy head Am fayer, so art thou my Spouse: For as Lilies whyte and read In beautie far passe the bowes Of thorne, Euen so thou my Loue, doest passe In fayth other daughters borne: The vnfaythfull that doe not passe To pricke thee muche wurse than thorne, With howes. xiii. The Spouse to her Beloued. The Argument. Because Christe compared his Spouse to a flower, she compareth hym agayne to an Apple tree, syngyng. Not I my Loue, it is, But thou that art so good: For I am scarce a flower, Where thou art very frute. For as among the trees That wylde grow in the wood, By nature sharp and sower, The Apple tree not brute But pure, is of great price: So thou Beloued of me, Among the sonnes of God, Sprites, Angels, soules, and men, Art principall in power. For all obey to thee, By scripture vnforbod To wurshyp where and when, Thy name at euery hower, With bowyng of theyr knees. xiiii. The Churche to the Younglinges. The Argument. The Churche hauyng compared Christe to an apple tree, declareth to the Younglynges the cause why she so dyd, swetely syngyng as foloweth. I whiche dyd long my Loue to know, Who is the apple tree of lyfe: Haue sit doune in his Psalm. xvi. Esai. xlix. Shade below, Whiche is his help and refuge ryfe. In this trees shade is quiet rest For all that truly therin trust: In whiche to sit for them is best, Who to fynde rest in soule, doe lust. For whyles I rested me in the shade Of Christes helpe, there dyd I eate The frute therof, Gods sprite, whiche made Me feele the taste of Manna meat. Wherof the relice is so swete Vnto my Throte, whyle I it chew: That doune I fall at Christes fete, For this his foÅd, high thankes to shew. For whyle I sat vnder his wyng, And trusted whole in power diuine: Than dyd he lead me lyke a Kyng, Into his wurd, his Oseas. ii. house of wyne. In whiche whan I holp from aboue, Was well refresht, my Kyng set vp His standard strong, whiche is his loue, For me, and all that taste his cup. xv. The Spouse to the Younglynges The Argument. The Churche beyng in the wyne seller of Goddes hollye wurde, and seyng therin the banner of his loue whiche he displayed for her, whan he gaue vp his body to the crosse, &amp; suffered with horrible payne and panges of death, his blud to be shed and powred furth, only for her sake, to pourge and cleanse her from all spot and wrincle, and to make her of his foule enemie his fayer Spouse, is so rauished with beholding his mercy, that desirous to haue all people loue hym she brasteth furth in her panges, syngyng to the Younglinges. The streamer haue I seen Of loue, whiche Kriste my Kyng Hath reard for those that been The flocke whome he woulde bryng To loue. With syght wherof my soule Doeth flambe in lyke desyer, And languisshing all whole Is fiercely set on fyer, With loue. Paue me therfore ye yong, With flowers beset me thicke: Ye faythfull make me strong, For loe how I am sicke For loue. With apples fyll me full, Gods wurd the lyuely quicke: With gyftes moste plentiful Of grace, for I am sycke Of Loue: Of loue, because I long That all mought saued be: That all that wander wrong Myght cleaue to Christe and me, By Loue. xvi. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. So feruent is the Churches zeale to bring all creatures to the loue of her Beloued, that it causeth the wycked, and suche as hate the truthe, to persecute her: whiche also for a whyle Christ suffereth, to trye whether she be constant in the truthe or no. Whiche she knowyng welynough, exhorteth the Younglynges not to be afrayed though the malice of manne for a tyme seeme to preuayle: and to cumfort them the more, allegeth that it cummeth not agaynst her Beloueds wyll, but purposely by the prouidence of God, whatsoeuer tribulacion she suffer: and that at length she shall haue the victorie ouer all her enemies. Vnder my head my Loue hath layed His left hande of aduersitie, To proue yf I woulde be afrayed His truth moste true to testifie Continually. He suffereth men me to assayle To trye me oft and diuersly To see yf malice may preuayle To make me leaue hym peruersly, Continually Wherwith although I be afflict, In wurth I take all louyngly: Beyng for Christes sake addict To suffre al paynes wyllyngly, Continually. For God whan it shal please his grace, May turne my trust to victorie: For why his ryght hande wyll embrace His Churche with all prosperitie, Continually. xvii. Christe to the Younglynges. The Argument. The Spouse hauyng drunke in the wyne celler of her Beloued, the secret misteries of his holy spirit, sitten vnder his shadow, eaten the apples of gostly graces, garnished with the swete smellyng flowers of many faythful people, vnderlayed with the left hand of affliccion, and embraced with the ryght hande of consolacion, obteyneth perfect peace: and layeth her doune to slepe and rest in Christe. Who takyng vpon hym to saue and kepe her in quiet, chaurgeth that none wake her through errours or new opinions, singyng. O all ye daughters of Ierusalem, I charge ye all bothe by the Roes and Hyndes, The spirites of Angels, bryghter than the gem, And in your help far swyfter than the wyndes: Whiche runne about as hynde or roe in field, To help the good that in my churche do dwell: By these I charge you, as ye wyll they yield Theyr seruice due, to saue and kepe you wel, That at no hande ye touche or cause to wake, The Churche my Spouse, that resteth in my lap: With vayne beleues, whiche flesly braynes doe make For snafflyng snares my faythful to betrap. But let her lye tyll by her owne accorde She wake her self, compelled by the zeale She bearth to you, to leade you to the Lorde That only can your soules sore wounded, heale. xviii. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. The Church hearyng Christe geue so strayte charge that none wake her, knoweth so well his voyce, that she affirmeth it to be his. And that it may the better be regarded, she declareth to the younglynges what he is that hath geuen the charge, syngyng. Of my Beloued this is the voyce, For I doe know his voyce in dede: Whiche causeth me muche to reioyce, That he, to me, wyll take suche hede. Loe how he leapeth vpon the hylles, And daunseth doune the dales by stealth: Whiche in his flesh al maner ylles And scorne, hath borne, to geue me health. Yea Christe my Loue moste good and kynde His Spouse to help in tyme of nede, Is swyft as Angel, Roe or Hynde: But much, more ruche, in makyng spede. Loe where he stands behynde our wall, Our flesh, that doeth the soule diuyde From God the good, through Adams fall: Whose sin, within our flesh doeth byde. Through which he by his gyftes of grace, Doeth pepe and looke in at our grate, And shyne through fayth our wyndoe place, To bend, and mend our woful state. xix. The Churche to the Younglinges. The Argument. The Churche whome no man may wake vp, but her Beloued, asketh hym continually what she shal doe: And whan he hath made her an answer, she publysheth it to the Younglynges, syngyng. My Loue whome in my harte alway I aske what wurke, he wyll I doe, Made answer thus without delay, And louely spake me to: Aryse, arise. Vp, vp my Loue, my doue, my frende, Make haste, whome I haue made so fayer: And cum to me, I wyll thee sende My flocke for to repayre. Aryse, arise. xx. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Christe seyng hys Spouse ready to ryse, encourageth her to make great haste: and exhortyng her to preache, declareth howe bothe the tyme and place is nowe fit therefore, openly syngyng. Of vnbelefe now is cowlde wynter past, The stormes lykewyse of blyndnes, and of trust In mannes deuice, the whiche dyd ouercast The truth, are goen: are knowen to be but rust. And loe the flowers of faythful men and iust In the erth, our lande, in beautie bud and bloome: So that the tyme for whiche thou long didst lust, The syngyng tyme, the tyme to preache is cum. The turtles voyce, the voyce of the holy gost, The wurd of God sincerely as it ought Was heard abrode in our landes litle coast, And as it shoulde, effectually hath wrought. The fygtree loe, her blossomes furth hath brought, The budded vines haue yelded out theyr smel: The faythfull folke to whom my truth was tought, In fayth and wurkes, excedyngly excell. Aryse therfore my spouse, my special Loue, Make haste, make spede, purely my wurde to preache: And cum to me, cum, cum to me my doue, To whome I geue myne holy goste to teache. Cum to the Rocke, to me thy stedy leache, Cum to the hoales, the merites of my death: Cum to the hyd degrees of fayth, that reache To perfectnes, assisted by my breath. Then turne to me thy face, and let me hear Thy voyce aloude, lyke thunder in the ayer. Thy preachyng voyce is pleasaunt to myne ear, And in myne iye thy face is very fayer. xxi. Christ to his Spouse. The Argument. Whyles the Church accordyng to Christes commaundement, preacheth remission of sinnes, through fayth in his blud, death and merites, false Apostles seyng the people ready to receyue what soeuer is taught, fayne themselues to be the Spouses healpers: and vnder that title deceyuyng the simple rude soules, preach for theyr profit, theyr own dremes and inuencions: promisyng merit and satisfaccion for supersticious wylwurkes. Whiche Christe perceyuyng, geueth his Spouse warnyng of them: &amp; streytly chargyng her to preach agaynst them: syngeth. Catche vs the false foxes that preache not the truth, Those young litle foxes whiche flatter my youth: Catche them with scripture, declare them theyr follie, Teache them to preache true my wurd that is hollie: And stroy not my vineyardes. They labour with learnyng the truth to deny, And through theyr false faynyng to lead men awry, Wastyng my vineyard, my people most holly: Therfore catche them quickly, that they by theyr folly, Destroy not my vineyardes. For loe now my vine trees begyn thycke to bud, In bryngyng furth bourgeons the whiche wyll be good: Catche then these foxes ye preachers most holly, Least by theyr flattring and false fayned folly, They stroy al my vineyardes. xxii. The Spouse to the Younglynges The argument. The Spouse consyderyng the carefulnes that her Beloued taketh for her and her maydens, admonisheth them therof: and declaring what loue she beareth hym agayne, and wyll doe euer, syngeth. Christe my Beloued whiche styl doth fede Among the flowers, hauyng delyght Among his faythful lilies: Doeth take great care for me in dede, And I agayne with all my myght Wyll do what so his wyl is. My Loue in me, and I in hym, Conioynde by loue wyll styl abyde Among the faythful lilies: Tyll day doe breake, and truth do dym All shadowes darke, and cause them slyde Accordyng as his wil is. xxiii. The Spouse to Christe. The argument. The Church accordyng to Christes commaundment, goeth about to catch the foxes: admonishing them of theyr wikednes, and shewyng what hurt they do to the Lordes vineyardes with preachyng theyr own dreamed diuices, &amp; supersticious wurkes: charitably exhortyng them to ceasse from peruertyng the people, and abusyng the holy scriptures. But the foxes are so proude, stubberne and stoute, that they wyll not yelde: but wylfully resist styl the truth. Wherfore she supposing that God hath geuen them ouer by withdrawing his grace from them, instauntly prayeth her Beloued to returne vnto them: and to mollifie theyr hardened heartes, that they may repent and be saued: syngyng. Returne my Loue, to these that are so blynde, And geue them grace, for lacke wherof they erre: Cum swyft my Loue, lyke to a Roe and hynde, Vpon these proude, these mountaynes of Bather. For from thy truth these proude deuided be, Of stomake haute, with troubles vexed sore: But meken them, and make them cum to me, Whiche soone shall be, if thou thy grace restore. Here endeth the second Chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .iii. Chapter. xxiiii. The new conuerted Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. At the desyer of his Spouse, Christe cummeth vpon the mountaines of Bather, the harde harted Foxes that destroyed his vineyardes, mekenyng through his grace, theyr loftie stomakes: so humbling them that they acknowlegyng theyr wyckednes, do repent and recant the false doctrine that they taught. And nowe receyued through fayth and humilitie into the felowshyp of Christes holy Churche, they confesse and openly publish the vaynenes of theyr former lyfe and of the tradicions and glorious wyl wurkes, which they so stifly mayntayned, singyng. In wysedome of the flesh, my bed, Fonde trust in wurkes of mannes deuise, By nyght, in darkenes of the dead, I sought for Christe, as one vnwyse, Whome my soule loueth. I sought hym long, but founde hym not, Because I sought hym not aryght: I sought in wurkes, but now I wot He is found by fayth, not in the nyght, Whome my soule loueth. I wyll vp (thought I) and get me out In lanes and stretes my Loue to fynde: And wandre others wurkes about, To seke hym in that citie blynde, Whome my soule loueth. I sought hym there but coulde not spede. The watche that of that citie been, False preachers there founde me in dede: Of whom I askt yf they had seen Whome my soule loueth. They saw hym not, nor greatly past My soule that sought hym to confounde: But whan I was a lytle past Fro them and theyrs, than hym I founde Whome my soule loueth. I caught hym quycke, by fayth and grace, And wyll not suffre hym depart, Tyl I haue brought hym to the place Where I hym sought with blynded hart, Whome my soule loueth. Tyl I hym bryng into the place Of vnbelief, my mothers house And Chaumber: that she may embrace His wurde, and be with me his spouse, Whome my soule loueth. xxv. Christe to the Younglynges. The Argument. So earnest is theyr zeale, whom God calleth to the truth, that after themselues haue by fayth and grace obteyned Christe and the true sence of his holy spirite, they can not be quiet vntyl they haue brought all other vnbeleuers of whose secte sumtyme they wer, vnto the state that they nowe be in. Whiche whan this newe conuerted churche hath brought to passe, she committeth her selfe wholly to Christe, who laying her downe to rest in the bed of quietnesse of conscience: comma?deth that none wake her: singing the same again, which in the seconde chapter he song to the yonglynges. O o ye daughters of Ierusalem O o ye daughters of Ierusalem. &amp;c. As before in the fowertenth song, in the second Chapter. xxvi. The Frendes to the Younglynges. Whyle the newe conuerted Spouse resteth in the sweete peace of conscience, she waxeth dayly more perfect and perfect: ascendyng from fayth to fayth, from clerenes to clerenes vntyll she cum to perfectnes: so that in this world which is a desert voyde of good people, she in all loue, pacience, vertue, holynes and perseueraunce in truth so shyneth, that the fyrste Spouse as it wer amased therat: syngeth. VVhat one is this that from the desert drye Of vnbelefe, lyke to the vapours thicke Of frankincence, in true belyef vp hye Ascendeth swete: as myrrhe that burneth tricke With poticary spice? It is the Churche that hath obtayned rest Of conscience, by fayth in Christes blood: Whome though the worlde do vtterly detest, Yet smokth she vp with wurkes that are as good, As poticary spice. xxvii. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. The perfect Spouse perceyuyng that the other is in the bed of Christe, out of whiche she smoketh vp so swetely, prayseth the bed to the Younglynges: syngyng. Beholde ye young, behold and see the bed Of Salomon, Christes peace wherin we dwell: With thre score men moste strong and myghtie fed Beset about, the strong of Israel That faythful are and wyse. Of whiche eche one doeth hold a cuttyng swurd, Expert therwith to stryke and warde in warre: Well learnde they be to preache and teache Gods wurd, And with the same to kepe all errors farre From godly men and wyse. Vpon theyr thygh this swurd, Gods wurd they wear, Gyrded therwith for fear of enemies, That cum by nyght the feble for to fear With priuie trappes of subtyl heresies Whiche fleshly wittes deuise. xxviii. The Spouse to the Younglynges The Argument. The Spouse hauing shewed to the Yonglinges the bewtie and municion of Christes bed, whiche is the peace of conscience obtayned by fayth, through hope and assurance of lyfe and ioye euerlastyng, for the merites of Christes deathe &amp; passion: how it is inuerened with true and faythful prechers whiche holde the sweard of the spirit, able to confound therewith what so euer doctrine of man maye disquiet anye of the faythfull restyng in the same, descrybeth in lyke manner the humanitie of her Beloued, syngyng. King Salomon, kyng Christe the prince of peace, Made for hymself a tabernacle clere, Of trees that swete in Libanus increace, A carnal corps, wherof the pyllers were Of syluer shene, the sylynges fyne of golde: Swete for to smell, and goodly to beholde. The stayers wherto of purple he hath wrought, His blood and sprite, wherby we do ascend To perfect blisse, to whiche we all be brought By help of grace whiche he to vs doeth lende. Vpon these stayers, by fayth we do obtayne The lyfe, for whiche our sauiour Christ was slayne. In the myds of Christes tabernacle strong With woundes beset, is made a pauement fayre Of Loue, for suche as for his grace do long: His faythfull flocke that wyll to hym repayre. This loue hath Christ prouided for all them That are the daughters of Ierusalem. Cum furth therfore from fleshly loue moste vayne Ye faythful folke, ye Sion daughters trym, To seekyng Christe, who for your sake was slayne In flesh wherwith his mother crouned hym By byrth, with myrth, the day whan man and God Wer ioynde with ioye, who long before wer od. Cum see his flesh, beleue that for your sake He dyed therin, and rose agayne to lyfe: That by his blood he myght them ryghteous make That trust in hym, and cleaue vnto his wyfe. Cum furth to see this Salomon your kyng, Who may alone your soules to glory bring. The ende of the thyrde Chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .iiii. Chapter. xxix. Christe to his perfect Spouse. The Argument. Whan the perfect Preachers haue declared the humanitie of Christe, in whiche he made satisfaccion to his father for the sinnes of the whole worlde, he praysyng them agayn, for all his gyftes in them, syngeth. Loe, thou art fayer, loe thou art fayer my Loue, Doues iyes thou hast, in iudgement simplenes: Besydes thy paste that standes thyne iyes aboue, Thy goodly attyre of fayth and humblenes. Thy heares also, thy truthes moste principal Are lyke a flocke of Goates moste quicke and pure, Whiche rounded are from of mount Giseal, The Byble boke, an heape of witnes sure. Thy teath also, thyne argumentes most strong With whiche thou doest all heresies deuour, Are lyke the flocke whiche shorne cum vp along The washyng place, Gods wurd that doeth them scour. Of whiche eche one in it two twinnes doeth bear, Gods wurd, and truth, and not so muche as one Is voyde therof: with these teeth thou doest tear Abuses byg, that thynke to rule alone. Thy lyppes, thy speche is lyke the skarlet red, Whiche for the elect, thy sauiour Christ doest preache, Afflicte in fleshe, with bloud his crosse bebled, To faythfull folke a swete and pleasaunt speache. Thy Chekes thy wurkes are louely, fayre and good Lyke to a broken piece of Pomegranade Whiche spring of faythe by merit of my blood, Besides thy tyre, my wurkes that wyll not fade. Thy necke thy faythe, is lyke to Dauids tower, Whiche buylded is with bulwarkes, whereupon A thousand shyldes of truthe, whiche men of power In faythe, haue borne, doe hang to fraye thy foen. Thy brestes, thy helpe to succour all that nede Alwayes at wurke, are lyke two litle twinnes, The whiche among the faythfull Lillies feede Tyll shadowes passe, and tyll the daye begynnes. xxx. Christe to his Spouse. The argument. Whan Christe hath praysed perfectly the perfect spouse, he calleth to mynde the other, whiche is yet in bed on slepe: and desirous to prayse her also, syngeth. To the mount of myrrhe wyll I goe, To the hyll of frankincence, Goe wyll I to my Spouse, slepie who Wysheth fayne in my presence To cum. Thou art fayer al whole o my loue, And no spot doeth rest in thee: Fro thy self cum, cum from aboue Libanus, though it bryght bee, Cum, Cum. In thy strength trust not o my Spouse, But in me put all thy trust: So thou shalt be made gloriouse, If thou wylt therfore be iust, Cum, cum. xxxi. Christe to his Spouse. The argument. Because the Churche shoulde cum the more spedely from all confidence in herselfe, to truste wholly in Christe: her Beloued shewyng why he called her, addeth great promises, whiche (yf she cum to hym) he wyl perfourme, syngyng. If that thou cum from Libanus to me, Thou shalt be crouned from Amana mount: From God, the hye top, crouned shalt thou be With truth, whose heygth al hye thynges doeth surmount. From Sanirs top, and eke from Hermon hie, The curses whiche thou shalt sustayne of men, Thou shalt be crounde from euery dignitie, From the Leoperdes mount, and from the Lyons den. xxxii. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Christe hauyng promysed to croune his Churche with truth, (for his self wyll be her croune) from Sanir and Hermon, the curses and troubles that she should sustayne for his sake, and from the Lyons den, and Leoperdes mounte, whiche signifie pleasures and delites, honors and dignities: (whiche though they be for the most part abused, yet Christe promyseth his Spouse that yf she trust in hym only, &amp; stande to his truth, she shal vse them to his glory, and be crouned of hym therefore) he begynneth to prayse her. But because she is not yet perfecte by reason of the flesh, whiche continually troubleth and hyndereth her, he lykyng sumwhat, and myslykyng elswhat, syngeth. My mynde thou hast whole rauyshed My spouse, my sister dere: Thou hast my hart whole rauyshed With one of thyne iyes clere. Thy perfect iudgement of my sprite Doeth muche my mynde refresh: Thyne other iye detest I quite, Thy iudgement of the flesh. In one lynke of the chayne lykewyse That hangth about thy necke, My mynde wholly thou doest surprise, For in it is no specke. The fruites whiche thou vnfaynyngly By fayth styl bryngest furth, Doe please my mynde excedyngly: The rest are nothyng wurth. xxxiii. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. After Christe hath praysed his Spouse for thone of her iyes, and for one of her chaynes, dispraysyng the other (for she hath yet one carnal iye, and doeth sum of her wurkes through hipocrisie) he prayseth the rest of her partes throwly, syngyng before the Younglynges. Howe fayre thy Dugges, thy charitie is my Spouse, My syster swete, more fayre they are than wyne: Thy sauour eke of my gyftes glorious, Do passe all odours, be they neuer so fine. Thy lyppes my Loue the hunney combe are lyke, From whiche my prayse doeth drop al men among: My scriptures eke that are not muche vnlyke Hunney and mylke, doe vnder lye thy toung. Thy garmentes gay, my merites whiche thou hast, Do sauour swete, lyke the mount Libanus. My Spouse, thou art an orchard locked fast Of pleasaunt trees, my elect most bounteous. Fast shut thou art, my syster, I thee kepe From all assaultes: thou art a sealed spryng Of waters pure, in truthes moysture so depe, That all may drynke whome grace shal therto bryng. The planted trees and frutes whiche grow in thee, Of Pomegranates are lyke a paradise, Beset about with fruites that pleasaunt bee, Of cumly heygth that spryng in goodly wyse. In thee doeth grow spykenarde and Calamus With saffron, Camphor, and the swete cypres, And all the trees that grow in Libanus: Swete Cynamome, strong Myrrhe and Aloes. With all hote spices aromatical. These are the elect and faythfull that doe dwell In thee my church, in office seueral: Who all through fayth, excedyng swete do smel. And thou my spouse of gardeyns art a wel, Thy dewie fayth doth moysten euery coost: Thou art also a poole the whiche doeth wel Vp lyuely springes, from out the holy goost. With these thy streames whiche calmly take theyr course From Libanus, my wurde that mountayne clere, Thou waterest the gardens fine or course Of all good folke, that in thy waye appere, Vp North wynde vp, vp tribulacion, Cum blast my gardeyn, that I may it trye: Cum Southwynde eke, cum consolacion And cherysh it, least sum part hap to dye. That whyle ye two vpon my churche do blow, The fragrant smell of truth may from her flow. xxxiiii. The Spouse to her Beloued. The Argument. After the north and southwynde haue so long blowen vpon the churche that her fruites of pacience, humblenes, obedience and charitie are rype: she calleth Christe vnto her his gardeyn: desyryng hym to eat his fruites, that is to accept for good the wurkes, which she through fayth in hym hath brought furth: syngyng as foloweth. Now that I am proued Let my best Beloued Whome mercie hath moued, To make me his gardeyn: Cum eat, and for good take My wurkes, for his blood sake The fruites let hym good make, Whiche grow in my gardeyn. Here endeth the fowerth Chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .v. Chapter. xxxv. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. At his Spouses request, Christ c?meth into his gardeyn: and gathereth his mirrhe with his spices, the vertuous dedes whiche through hym she bryngeth furth: and eareth his hunney combe with his h?ney and drynketh his wyne with his mylke, that is, he accepteth well her good doctrine wherwith she nurissheth &amp; comforteth the Younglynges. Whiche al he calleth his, because that for his sake she did them: and whan he hath so doen, he certifieth his Spouse therof, syngyng. To thee my Spouse, my gardeyn great of price, My syster dere, I am cum at thy request: I haue cropt my myrrhe, and odourykyng spice, Good wurkes whiche fayth hath gendred in thy brest. My hunney combe with hunney of the best My wurde, my truth, my promise I haue eat: I stande therto, and wyll perfourme the rest That graunted is in swete so fyne a meat. My cheryng wyne, the strongest of my truth, Whiche in mennes heartes through preachyng, depe is sounk: Myxt with my mylke, weak doctrine for my youth, Powrde out by thee, I haue both seen and drounk. xxxvi. Christe to his Spouse. [The Argument] Christe seyng his Spouses fruites of most holsum doctrine, to be excellent good, calleth his fyrst Churche, the whiche now are his frendes, vnto his banket: willyng them not only to eat and drynke his churches mylk and wyne, that is the doctrine of holy scripture, but also to be drunke, that is to haue all carnall iudgement cleane ouercum with the perfect knowlege of his wurde, syngyng to them. Eat my frendes and drynke, My Spouses mylke and wine: My wurde whiche to the brynke Is full of foode diuine, Both meat and drynke. My Frendes whome I loue moste Drynke, drinke tyll ye be drounk: Drynke tyll my holly goste In you be throughly sunke, Drinke and be drunke. xxxvii. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. The Spouse hyndred with the heauy burden of the flesh, falleth oft: becummeth negligent in her ministerie, and slepeth as touchyng the flesh: but in her hart and spirit watcheth continually, alwayes attentiue and hearkenyng whan God wyl moue and wake her vp, to doe any thyng. Whiche she confesseth her selfe, syngyng to the Yonglynges. I i my selfe whome flesh doeth ouermatche Doe slepe in sinne, obey my worldly wyll: But yet my harte, and sprite doe wake and watche, To serue the Lorde, his lawes for to fulfyll With harte and mynde. But whyle I thus, in fleshly slepe am styll, Beholde the voyce of Christe whome moste I loue, I hear in flesh, wheron he knocketh styll, From earth commaundyng me to cum aboue, True rest to fynde. xxxviii. Christe to his perfect Spouse. The Argument. Whan Christe (accordyng to the confession of his welbeloued Spouse) hath styerred and waked her vp by the secret wurkyng of his grace, from the sluggysh rest whiche she had in her disobedient and vnruly flesh, he cummeth hym selfe vnto her, with his head God the father hye head of all, full of the dewe of his grace, truth and mercie: hauyng hys heary lockes full of the nyght droppes of tribulacion, persecucion, and affliccion. (For all that receyue Christe with the dewe of his fathers truth and mercye, must also receyue the troubleous nyghtdroppes of his heares.) And now desirous that she should so receyue hym, syngeth. Open to me, my syster, my Loue, Receyue my truthe, that I shal to thee shew: Open to me my darlyng, my Doue, For loe my head, my head is full of dewe, Of truth, grace, and mercie. Also my hears with nyght drops abounde, My truth is full of tribulacion: Fear thou not yet, for fayth shall thee grounde And make thee strong in persecucion, Through truth, grace, and mercie. xxxix. The Spouse to her Beloued. The Argument. The Spouse (whose flesh is not ful mortified, and obedient to the spirit) is troubled sore with this request of her Beloued. She is in the bed of quietnes already, and hath as she thynketh, put of the vesture of olde Adam, with trust in her owne righteousnes, and hath washed her feete from the soule affecci?s, lustes, and desiers of worldly thynges. Thus thynkyng (but she is deceyued) she reasoneth with her Beloued, syngyng. My fleshly coat, my trust in wurkes of man I haue put of, I count them all as vayne, And rest in peace: o Lorde howe shal I than, Attyre my selfe, and put it on agayne? My feete also, my affectes and pleasures vyle, Are washt away, as thou thyself moste good, Commaundedst me: why shall I then defyle My feete agayne, in vile and fylthy mud? xl. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The Argument. The Churche beholdeth Christ, and would gladly receyue hym, for her soule deliteth in his dewy head, but her flesh can not away with the nyghtdroppyng heares, which caused her as though she had ben perfect, to reason with Christ, and to thynke that he woulde haue her put on her coate agayne, whan as in dede he woulde haue her cum naked to put on the coat whiche he wyll geue her. Thus is the poore churche deceyued through frayltie of the flesh: whiche he consyderyng and seyng the dore shut, that is the spirite so hyndred in carnal iudgement, that she can not receyue hym, thrusteth in his hande, that is his power, grace, and helpe, through the hole of the dore, that is the eleccion whiche remayneth in olde Adam the dore of the flesshe, whiche through his grace he openeth. Whiche the Spouse felyng, confesseth: syngyng. My Loue dyd put his hande of myght, In to my hole of fleshly sence: Whereby myne inwarde partes outryght Dyd swel and ryse, through influence Of grace. Than vp I rose with diligence To open that he mought cum in Whome I doe loue, by whome my sence Of fleshly wit was made so thin. By grace. No sooner I vp risen was But that my handes (fast shut before) Dyd drop with Mirrhe, good wurkes did passe My fyngers from styll more and more By grace. The doar bar eke that made me slacke To let hym in that knocked fast My carnal sence I thrust abacke: But Christe before was goen and past, Helas. As soone as my Beloued spake, My soule to search hym waxed meke: My soule long hyd, his voyce dyd make From flesh to flee, his helpe to seke Apace. I sought hym long but coulde not fynde; I called hym, he answered not: Awhyle he left me to my mynde, Because at fyrst I opened not. Helas. The tyrauntes that the citie watche False Prelates whiche the truth confounde, That sought for Christe poore me dyd catche, And stroke therfore, and dyd me wounde Helas. The kepers of the cursed wall, Suche rites as truthles men deuise: By force dyd take my cloke and all, Because I dyd theyr wurkes dispise, Helas. Ye daughters of Ierusalem, Ye faythfull preachers of the wurd, Whiche preache Gods truthes, and folow them, That stryke with his two edged swurd By grace: I charge you yf ye chaunce to fynde Christe my Beloued that dwelles aboue, Ye shew hym how sore I in mynde Am sycke, and languish whole for loue Of grace. xli. The Younglynges to the Spouse. The Argument. The Younglynges beyng charged of the Churche that yf they fynde her Beloued, they shew hym how she is louesicke, because they know hym not (as in dede none can excepte the faythfull haue taught them) enquyer what he is, singing. VVhat one is he, Beloued of thee, Beloued of God aboue, Of women bryght, O fayrest to syght, What maner one is thy Loue? What maner one is. &amp;c. What may he be, Beloued of thee, Of God beloued also: What one is he, So loued of thee, Of whome thou doest charge vs so? Of whome thou doest, &amp;c. xlii. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The argument. The Church at the Younglynges request, describeth her beloued in .iii. songes, syngyng. Christe God and man (ye young) yf ye know not, Is suche an one as hath in hym no spot. My Loue ye shall vnderstand, Is whyte in diuinitie, Red in humanitie, Chosen among a thousand. His head the father, God the most of myght, Is golde, of nature perfect, pure and bryght. My Loue ye shall vnderstand, Is whyte in diuinitie, Red in humanitie, Chosen among a thousand. His heares, his truthes, are lyke the Palmetree bowe, Crow blacke to suche as wyll them not allow. My Loue ye shal vnderstand, Is whyte in diuinitie, Red in humanitie, Chosen among a thousand. xliii. The Churche to the Younglinges. The Argument. Whan the Churche hath shewed the eleccion of Christe (for he is the chyef and onely elect sonne of his father) and his two natures, diuinitie and humanitie: she procedeth on in the descripcion of the rest of his partes, syngyng. My Spousis iyes, his iudgementes wunderful Are lyke the Doues, vpon the water brooke, Whiche washt with mylke of truth, rest where they wull, Replete with sprite and power echewhere to looke. His Chekes, his wurdes wherby we doe hym know, Are lyke earthbeds, of spices fine and pure: Good bokes in whiche his truth doeth dayly grow For preachers suche as put the same in vre. His lyppes, suche men by whome he speakes his wyll Are lillies whyte, where puritie is had: From whome the myrrhe of scripture doeth distil, Preseruyng good, but bytter to the bad. His handes, his power by whiche all thynges are wrought, Knowen by the wurkes, are very rynges of gold: With Hiacincthes set as full as can be thought, His goodly wurkes whiche dayly we beholde. His belly or harte, whiche are affectes and wyl, Are constant, firme, lyke to the Eliphantes tooth, Beset with saphirs, clernes shynyng styl, In all his wurkes both doen and that he doeth. His Legges, whiche are his strength, his force, his garde, His enmies doune, his faythful vp to holde: Are pyllers strong, of marble stone most harde, That buylded be on bases made of golde. His shape, in whiche he sheweth hymself to vs, In whiche through fayth, all faythful doe hym see, Is most of price lyke to mount Libanus, Wheron doeth grow the hye swete Cedre tree. His throte, the fayth whiche we receyue of hym Wherby we take his peace and righteousnes, Is swete, swete, swete: my Loue in euery lym, So perfect is, as no toung can expresse. xliiii. The Spouse to the Younglynges. The argument. Whan the Churche hath particulerly descrybed Christe as well as she coulde, at last astonished with beholdyng the depth of his wunderful mercies, and hyndered through infirmitie to vtter suche thinges as she gladly would, she breketh out into wunderyng: and desyrous to styr vp al other to desyer hym, concluded muche in few wurdes, syngyng. Ye faythfull would ye know, At full what one he is? My wit and learnyng is to low To shew that shape of his. Yet thus saye I of hym, Because ye me requyrde: His excellence in euery lym, Ought wholly be desyerde. My Loue is suche a gem, My Frende also is he: Ye daughters of Ierusalem, Suche is my Loue to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .vi. Chapter. xlvi. The Younglynges to the Spouse. The Argument. The Younglynges although they haue been long ledde in darknes, and seduced with blyndnes of errours, yet hearyng Christe truly preached, with his death, power, and merites throughly declared, dooe hungre and thyrste for the true righteousnes: Whiche that they maye the sooner obtayne, they demaunde of the Church whither her Beloued is goen, and that twyse for faylyng, shewyng therby theyr earnestnes that they haue to helpe to seke hym, syngyng as foloweth. Of women fayrest thou, Because thou doest excell In fayth, all other foke That haue receyued the yoke Of the gospell: For whome thou sekest now, Hym whome thou louest so well, Why whither is he gone? Why left he thee alone? Tell we praye thee. Why whither is he goen, Whome thou doest loue so well, Howe parted he away? Shew vs that we eke maye. Seke hym with thee. xlvi. The Spouse to the Younglinges. The Argument. The Churche whiche euen nowe sought for her beloued &amp; could not fynde hym, beyng now required of the Younglynges to shew where he is, doth not only know where for to seke hym, but also where to fynde hym: and therfore maketh answer to the Younglynges, syngyng. My Beloued descended doune In to his fruitful orcharde: With his good gyftes his Churche to croune, To kepe styl the same in sauegard. He is goen to the beddes of spice, The bokes whiche he is declarde in: On them to feede whiche exercise The scriptures, that are his gardin. To fede hym selfe among his flocke, It euermore his wyll is: To plucke the flowers of Abrams stocke, His clere clothed faythful lilies. In my Loue I alone delyght, Whiche maketh me so ioyfull: And I am louely in his syght, That feedeth among the faythfull. xlvii. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Whan the Spouse hath shewed that Christ is goen doun into his Churche whiche is his gardeyne, (not that she at any tyme lacked hym, for she had him euen wh? she sought hym, but she felt hym not: &amp; therfore she sayeth he went doun into her, because he than holpe her) and towlde also that he cummeth to the spice beddes, the bokes of holy scripture, alwayes present there to geue to all those the fruites of euerlastyng lyfe, that sincerely study, and earnestly accomplysshe the thinges taught them therin: And that besyde his presence in her and in the scriptures, he fedeth among the lilies, those are the true and faythfull beleuers: not that he eateth them, but rather they hym, in perfectly beleuyng in hym: and howe she only delyteth in hym and he in her: Christe allowyng her zeale prayseth her. And where as before she had a carnall iye, and false chayne of hipocritical wurkes about her fayer neck, her iudgement is now so vpryghte, and her charitable deades so good and perfect, that he delyted therwith, syngeth. Fvll fayer art thou my frende, And frendely there withall. For why thy good wyll doeth extende, To all that on thee call. Fayer, fayrer than the gem, Thou art, and doest appere, Lyke the heauenly Ierusalem, Whiche is to God so dere. And lyke an armye dight, So dreadful art thou alse: Whiche with my wurde doest put to flyght, Al doctrines that be false. Thou holdest furth my crosse, that bluddy standard strong: And sayest mennes wurkes therto are mosse, And doe my death great wrong. Thy iudgement in my wurd, Is paysed so vpryght, That in my mynde I am styll sturde In thee to haue delyght. Turne backe from me thyne iyes, For they haue made me proude I mean thyne earnest excercise In iudgement wel allowed. Thy heares, that is to saye, thy scripture grounded notes, In lyuelynes to dure alway, Are lyke a flocke of Goates. Are lyke a flocke of goates, from Gileal clypped rounde: For all thy truthes and scripture notes, Are in the Byble founde. Thy teeth, thy reasons strong, that doe so well agre: Are lyke vnto the flockes of shepe That scarce can numbred be. Whiche clean cum vp along, Out from the washyng place. Thyne argumentes that are so strong In scripture take theyr grace. Of whiche eche hath within, The truth and scripture grounde: Lyke flockes where eche beast hath a twin, And none is barayn founde. Lyke to the Pomegarnarde, That cut in twayne, is read: So all thy wurkes, thy chekes, outwarde Do shyne, and none are dead. Besydes thy fyllet fine, My wurkes that can not fayle: Whiche garnysh al good wurkes of thyne, Whiche els could not auayle. xlviii. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Christe beyng highly pleased with his Spouses iyes and heares, whiche she lacked at the fyrste, prayseth her now. But aboue all his Churches, bothe Quenes, whiche are the perfectest: concubines, that are not throwly perfect: and damsels whiche yet are young in fayth: with all the rest, he prayseth one, whiche is the primatiue churche of his Apostles, callyng her his Doue, and perfect one, to allure the Yonglinges to ensue her steppes, swetely syngyng to them. Accordyng to the rates, of gyftes of godly grace. Within my church there are estates, wherof no one is base. Of whiche threscore are Quenes, that haue got perfectnes, And there be fowerscore concubines, with damsels numbreles. But al the rest aboue, in one doe I delyght, One through my loue is made my doue, and perfect in my syght. One is the chyef elect, vnto her mother dere, To all that are of Abrams sect, who truly dyd her bear. The daughters of Sion, those faythfull dyd her see, And preached frankly euery one that most blessed was she. The Quenes dyd prayse her eke, and shal so doe alwayes, The Concubines also dyd speake, of her, excedyng prayse. xlix. Christe to his Spouse. The argument. Whan Christe hath magnified his Spouse with no lyttle c?mendacion, yet is he not satisfied: but that the yonglynges maye lyke her the better, procedeth farther, comparyng her to the mornyng, to the sunne, to the moone, and to a banner: and as it were wundryng at her excellencie, singeth. VVhat one is she so lyke the morow bryght, Whiche yet doeth lacke the fulnes of my lyght, Whiche she hereafter shall receyue In glory? Who lyke the Moone is pleasaunt to the syght, My Moone I meane, my truth that shynes by nyght. Whiche doeth of me her lyght receyue, In glory? Yea what is she so lyke the Sunne elect: Lyke me the Sunne, chief of the chosen sect, Whiche shyne aboue with my father, In glory? Yea what is she so dreadfull to beholde, Whiche on my wurd doeth bear her selfe so bolde, Styll standyng styffe lyke a banner, In glory? l. Christe to hys Spouse. The Argument. Whan Christ hath wundred at the excell?cie of his spouse and compared her to the mornyng, because of the lacke of perfect glory whiche she can not attayne so long as she is subiect to the fraile body: and to the Moone that is the truth whiche taketh lyght of hym, as the moone doeth of the sun, whiche as it shyneth in the darke, so doeth the Churche in aduersitie and persecucion: and to the Sunne, that is hymselfe the Sunne of righteousnes, callynge her electe as hymselfe, the chefe and principal elect of his father: and last of all to a banner, for her terriblenes in fraying her aduersaries: whan he hath thus wunderyngly praysed her, he cummeth downe into her to se yf his vines bud, and pomegrates flower, whether his elect haue a lyuely iustifiyng fayth, whiche wurketh by loue, that if they be barayn he maye curse them as he dyd the fruteles fygtree. Math. xx. and whan they be wydered to cast them out of his gardayne. And beyng nowe in his Nutgardeyn, he declareth why he cummeth, singyng. To my Nutgardayn free, Whom tribulacions hyde: I am cum the saplynges for to see, Whiche grow by the ryuers syde. To see yf that the vine, The fayth that I thynke so good, With the wurkes and fruites of loue diuine, Begyn thorowly to bud. To see yf that the plantes, Of fine Pomegranates yelde: Pleasaunt fruites, whiche euery tree that wantes Shall be cast furth from my fyelde. li. The Spouse to her Beloued. The Argument. Whan Christ hath told his Spouse that he is descended into her to see the fruites of her faythful people, she ignoraunt before hearyng nowe his voyce, confesseth her ignoraunce, acknowlagyng her imperfeccion. And not withstandyng the greate prayses wherewith her Beloued magnified her, she presumeth not: but humbly acknowlegyng her estate confesseth her ignoraunce: syngyng. I knew not I, Thou wast so ny, Tyll by thy wurd so swete, Thou madest me know, Thou wast cum low, And louely dydst me grete. I was I graunt, Blynde ignoraunt. And knew nothing at all: Through flesh or blood, That coulde doe good, Before thou didst me call. Thy wurd awaye, My wyt I saye Knewe no whyt of thy wyll: I knew not why, Thou camest so nye, With frute thy self refyll. But whan thy voyce (That doeth reioyce All faythful that it hear) Sounded so shrill, I knew thy wyll, And what thou madest there. lii. The Spouse to the Younlinges. The Argument. The Churche hauyng before the Younglynges confessed her ignoraunce, and declared that without the wurde of God no man can be certified of his wyll, and doubtyng nowe least they yet waueryng for want of knowlege, and ouercharged with the heauie burden of the body, flesh, and sin, should dispayer of Gods fauour, because their offences are so great that they be neyther able to bear them, nor to recompence th? with the best wurkes they can deuise: and also because they lacke the wurkes whiche Christe cam to see in hys gardeyne: And to shewe that it is Christes wyl that all whiche are of his Churche ought to bear one an others burdeyne, she syngeth to the Younglynges. Fear not ye young though heauy be your yoke, Your yoke of sinne that causeth you to feare: For Christe my soule, whiche lately to me spoke, Wyll that I healpe the burdens byg to beare, Of Aminadif. Aminadif, my wyllyng people be, Suche as gladly Gods wurd both doe and heare: Whose wheles to draw my soule appoynted me: Christ wyll I shall the burdens help to bear Of Aminadif. liii. The Younglynges to the Spouse. The Younglynges hauyng heard the Churches great consolacion, and seyng what paynes she taketh for theyr sake in fasting and prayers, to relieue them of theyr heauy burden, call her now backe agayne to preache: that they maye beholde and see, as well the precious giftes of God within her, as the tribulacions they see vpon her, syngyng as foloweth. Payne not thyselfe so sore, Our burdens byg to bear. But that as we haue doen before, We may thy prech?g hear: Cum agayne cum agayne, Returne thou perfect one, Thou plentifull in peace, That we may se thy gyfts eche one: For our faynt faythes encrece Cum agayne, cum agayne. liiii. Christe to the Younglynges. The Argument. Whan the Younglynges whiche iudge not by the outewarde wurkes of fastyng, praying, and almose deedes, with other rites and ceremonies whiche the wycked may doe vnder hipocrisie with as goodly a face and shew as the moste faythfull, haue called agayn the churche, to vewe her as well within as without: Christe to thintent that his faythfull be not deceyued, teacheth howe and by what markes to knowe his churche, singyng to the yong. Ye young that call agayne, My spouse, my chyef delite, What is the cause that ye so fayne Would see the Sulamite? In her what would ye see, What thyng would ye behold? She is not as ye thynke she bee Gaye clad in sylke and golde. But simple to the syght in her are pitched tentes, With souldiers full armed to fyght Agaynst all false intentes. If this syght maye ye please, whiche pleaseth me alone, Ye maye beholde her at your ease, And vewe her gyftes eche one. Here endeth the syxte Chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .vii. Chapter. lv. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Christe hauyng taught the Younglynges to knowe the true Spouse by her pitched tentes, which as it is declared before, are the bookes of scripture, out of whiche, she kepeth warre agaynst the enemies of the truthe: begynneth to prayse her afresh, syngyng. Thou that art my dawhter, who am the pr?ce of peace, Because thou preachest peace of conscience in my blood How plesant are thy steps which swiftly stil increace To shew my gospell euery where? In shoes both strong and good, For preachers to weare. The cumpas of thy thyghes, thy power for to beget And to engendre suche as to my truth must stycke, Because it styl bringthe furth, withouten stop or let, Is lyke an endles lynked chayne, Of Gods own hand made tricke Alwayes to remayne. Thy Nauyl rounde, that is the holy Byble boke, Through whiche thy young do sucke the mylke of foode diuine: Is alwayes full for all that can my doctrine broke, Lyke to a mazar brode in brynke, Whiche neuer wanteth wyne, For them that woulde drynke. Thy Belly byg and hart, thy affeccions and thy thought Full of Gods holy wurd that fine and deyntie meat, Whiche nurisheth the soule, by which (whan thou wilt ought) Thou searchest fyrst what Gods wyl is, Is lyke an heap of wheate, Beset with Lillies. Thy brestes, thy ready help to comfort them that nede, Aboundyng styl, are lyke a she goates double twin. Thy necke, thy fayth is lyke an yuory tower in dede, For it is perfect, strong, and clear, Without and eke within, As it doeth appear. Thyne iyes, thyne vpryght iudgementes in my wurd so brim, Styll iust and full, are lyke the pooles in Hesebon, Of waters clere, besyde the porte of Bathrabim: For where the people gathered are, Thou truth to euery one Doest iustly declare. Thy face, thy wurkes, by whiche all people doe thee know, For which thou through my blud, doest hope to haue reward, Surmountyng in theyr heygth mans wurkes that lye below, Are lyke the tower of Libanus That alwayes hath regard Toward Damascus. Thy head, I Christe my selfe, a circumcised lambe, Am lyke to Carmell ground, both fertile, free and harde, Thy heares also, the truthes wherwith I thee emflambe, Are purple coulored lyke a kyng That goeth furth with his gard, Hym inuironyng. lvi. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Christe hauyng praysed his Spouse particulerly, begynnyng at her feete and g?yng vpward to her head, where as he was wunt to begyn at the head, and thence to go dounwarde: procedeth as he was wunt, with moste earnest affeccion syngyng. Oh howe fayer, howe fayer art thou my ioye? How louely my Loue, how louely art thou alse: Oh my spouse how wanton and how coy Thou art in delites whan I doe thee enhalse. O my Darlyng. Lyke thou art in stature to the tree, Of Palmes, for no wayght can let thee for to grow: And thy brestes are lyke as semeth me, To clusters of grapes, that rype hang doune below, O my Darlyng Clyme wyll I the Palme tree then I sayde, And wyl by the frutes and braunches hye take holde: I my self (my church) wyll be thyne ayde, And sit thee vpon, to make thy younglinges bolde, O my Darlyng. There wyll I thy dugges so fruitful make, That they shall be lyke the clusters of the vine: And the smell that thou shalt of me take, Shall reike fro the nose lyke sent of appuls fyne, O my Darlyng. Make wyll I thy throte, that is thy voyce So moyst with the muste of truth my chefest wyne, That my frende, my byshop shall haue choyce Of doctrine to preache out of those truthes of thyne, O my Darlyng. There shal he haue meate and drinke at wyll, To chew with his teeth and lyps: there shal he haue Misteries, wheron to vse hym styll. Of the shall he learne hym self and moe to saue, O my Darlyng. lvii. The Spouse to the Younglynges The argument. After that Christe hath clymed vp into his churche, a very Palme tree, and made her aboundant in all good gyftes of grace, so that her nose smelleth lyke apples, whiche signifie gyftes of the holy goste, whiche she geueth vnto other by preachyng and laying on handes, &amp; by ministryng to them the holy sacramentes: and hath moystned her mouth &amp; throte with the wyne of his holy wurd, she byandby in the hearyng of the Younglynges, preacheth: in wurdes but a small sermen, but in sence full of muche good matter, syngyng. Al worldly thynges I vtterly reiect: All meanes of men to health I do detest: In Christe alone, my spouse, my Loue elect, I rest in rest, in hym in whome is rest For all that are wery. Whole his I am both body, soule, and lyfe, He is my Loue my sauiour, and my helth: And he is pleasde with me, as with his wyfe, To whome he turnes (ye faythfull) for your welth, Vs all to make mery. lviii. The Spouse to her Beloued. Whan the Churche hath wel instructed the younglynges and hath still an earnest desier to preache, she consydereth that abrode in the worlde, whiche here is called a fyelde and countrey, there are many that know not Christe, whiche neuertheles thorough good instruccion, woulde soone becum good Christians: wherfore she hath a desier to go preache to them. But because she knoweth that all her endeuoures can profit nothyng without Christe hymself be present, and helpe with the secrete callyng of his grace and spirite, she desyreth hym to goe with her, and declareth what she would haue hym to doe there, syngyng. Now that my young sufficiently are taught, Cum my Beloued, assist me with thy power: And to the fyelde where yet the men know naught Of thee nor thyne, together let vs walke. That they bedewed with grace thy pleasaunt shower, May cum to thee, and hearken to my talke. And in the townes and villages so bruite, In whiche no wurde nor mencion is of thee, Let vs two lodge together, and get fruite Whiche may hereafter glorifie thy name: And of thy churche the perfect membres be, By knowyng truthe, and wurkyng of the same. Whan this is doen, than early wyll we ryse, And goe to see yf our olde vineyardes bud, To see yf that our young do exercise Theyr fruitfull fayth, and gyftes of godly grace, Whether theyr dedes and doctrine bothe be good, Or yf the wedes, or foxes them disgrace. To see also yf our Pomegranades sprede, Suche witnesses as wyl theyr lyues bestowe, Thy truth to auaunce: for there loe wyll I shede My Loue all whole that I to thee doe beare: There wyll I spende the talentes that I owe, To thee my Loue, to bryng them out of feare. lix. The Spouse to her Beloued. The Argument. After that Christe at his Spouses requeste, hath bene with her in the fielde, and lodged with her in the vyllages, and that so long that they haue there wunne a new company to the belyef of the gospel: he as she desyred hym; cummeth with her now to see the vines and pomegranades, whether they be fruitfull or no. And whan the Churche hath wel beheld them, she smelleth the Mandrags, that is the doctrine and preachyng of the faythful, and delyted therwith, sheweth Christ therof, syngyng. The Mandrages yeld theyr smell of godly lyfe, And doctrine pure, that bryngeth vnto rest Vnquiet myndes, vncertayn, styll at stryfe, Through want of wurkes, wherein they put theyr trust: Of these they learne that of theyr dedes the best, Are insufficient for to make them iuste. They learne of these that only of Christe they must Be ryghteous made, through merit of his Crosse: And that by fayth they must receyue must Of ryghteousnes, through trust in Christes blood. This stylleth soone the mynde that sinnes doe tosse. Whiche sent (O Christe) cummeth from our Mandrages good. Within our dores, our custody moste sure, Are fruites, the whiche the faythfull haue brought furth, Of euery kynde of lyfe and doctrine pure, Bothe of the newe and of the scriptures olde Whiche I haue kept for thee to take in wurth, O Christe my Loue, beloued a thousande folde.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The .viii. Chapter. lx. The Spouse to Christe. The argument. Whyle the perfect Spouse taketh her pleasure with her Beloued, gatheryng the fruites of the old &amp; newe testament, to preache Christes humanitie, and the wurkes whiche he wrought in the same, the younglynges whiche she lefte in the fyeldes and villages (whiche may well betoken the sectes of the Phylosophers, Phariseis, Saduceis, and al other like whiche sought for ryghteousnes in theyr wysedome &amp; dedes) seyng the puritie of the vineyard, and smellyng the sauour of the Mandragoras, an heauy smell to them, partly because it condemneth theyr rightousnes, and partly because it maketh them lament theyr imperfeccion, begynne to long for the true ryghteousnes, and saluacion: whiche because they can haue by none other meane than by Christe, they seke hym, and are therfore mocked, and persecuted of those sectes, of whyche they wer before, whiche is theyr mothers house, whose great blyndnes they (beyng now his Spouse) pitiyng, wysh for to fynde hym abrode, and to bryng hym to them, syngyng. O That I once myght haue the hap to fynde Thee (O my Loue) abrode in euery place: That euery man of euery sort and kynde Myght trust in thee, and eke thy wurde embrace. Thus, thus abrode, would God I mought thee mete, To receyue of thee, the kysse of peace and rest: Whome I in hart, loue as my brother swete, Whiche sumtyme suckt with me my mothers brest. O that thou Christe my Spouse wouldest bryng to passe That I myght mete and kysse thee in this wise And that the worlde now ignoraunt alas, Myght vs beholde, and neythre of vs despyse. In the meane whyle I wyll thee leade my loue, And bryng thy name into my mothers house: That there thou Lorde mayest teache me from aboue, And draw by grace my mother to thy spouse. That I maye chere thee there with spiced wine Of doctrine pure, well poudred with thy woorde: And with the iuyce of swete Pomegranades fine, The blud of martirs shead with fyer and swoorde. lxi. The Spouse to the Younglynges The Argument. Christ seyng his Younglynges so earnestly set to receyue hym, that they promys to ieoberd theyr lyfe for the profession of his name, cummeth to them, and geuyng them his kysse of peace, taketh them to his Spouse: &amp; than as he dyd to the other Churches before, he c?meth to her with his dew and nyght droppes, to proue and trye her: wherfore she beyng sore afflicted of her mothers houshold, that such as are weak fall not from her, declareth that Christ hath not forsaken her but hath purposely brought that crosse vpon her, and that at length she shall haue the victorye of all her aduersaries, and persecutours, syngyng. Vnder my head the chief men of my flocke, That to the truth must stycke styll vnafrayed, Of Christe my Spouse, my anker, and my rocke, The lefte hande of aduersitie is layed. Yet for all that, nothyng can me deface, Though for a tyme harme doe preuayle through hate: For why at length Christs ryght hande shall embrace My body whole, with prosperous estate. [lxii] Christe to the whole worlde. The Argument. Whan Christe hath tryed his Spouse with persecucion, and founde her constant, he receyueth her into his bed of peace, quietnesse, and rest, geuyng chaurge to the Daughters of Ierusalem, as many as entende to obtayne fauoure at his hande, that they trouble her not with vayne questions false opinions, supersticious tradicions, ydle and dum ceremonies, newe constitucions, wicked decrees, nor vngodlye lawes: but to suffer her slepe in the faythe and quyetnesse of conscience that she hath receyued of hym already, til she wake her selfe: eyther through his instigacion to auaunce his glory, or by sum charitable mocion to healpe her neyghboures: syngyng as foloweth. O o ye daughters of Ierusalem, All suche as lyst my voyce to vnderstande: Marke what I saye to you, and to all them That hope to haue saluacion at my hande, Concernyng my faythfull. She doeth beleue the scriptures euery iote, With all the truthes that therin are contaynde: My sacramentes also she knoweth by rote, With gyftes of grace that are by them attaynde Of all that are faythfull. She doeth beleue the father omnipotent, To haue created the erth, and heauens hie: From whome the wurde into the worlde was sent And toke flesh of the virgin pure Marie A woman moste faythfull. And in that flesh was hanged on the tree, Wheron he shed his blud to reconcile His fathers wrathe, to whiche all subiect be That know not Christe, but doe his death defyle, Remaynyng vnfaythfull. Who on the Crosse by death made recompence, For all the sinnes of all that in hym trust: From whome he frely pourged all offence, And in Goddes syght through fayth alone made iust, All them that are faythfull. He rose agayne, she beleueth, with all the rest Of tharticles that in the scripture be: Through whiche belief she hath attayned rest Of conscience, and slepeth nowe in me. Through hope very ioyfull. I charge you than on payne to lose the lyfe Whiche dureth euer in heauen ioyes aboue, Ye fayne no fayth, nor stirre vp any stryfe, Whereby to wake from rest my quiet loue, Through hope very ioyfull. But let her lye tyll by her owne accorde She wake herselfe, compelled by the zeale She hath to you, to leade you to the Lorde, Who can alone the soules sore wounded heale, Of all that are faythfull. lxiii. The perfect Spouse to Christ. The Argument. Whyle the Churche is at rest in Christe, she waxeth dayly more and more notable through her good lyfe and Godly conuersacion: whiche the perfecte Spouse woundryng at, syngeth. What maye she be that doeth ascende, Out from the desert place, Of worldly folke that woulde not bende Them selues to call for grace? What is she that ascendeth hye, Leanyng vpon her loue: That trusteth whole in Christes mercy Through grace sent from aboue? lxviii Christe to the Churche. The argument. Christe maketh aunswere, declaryng what she is, where and howe he founde her: and declaryng what he dyd for his Spouse, doeth syng as foloweth. Emong the apple trees, I waked thee vp my spouse, Where as thou sleptest in sin, in sin original, Which Eua, by the frute she plukt fro the apple bowes, Brought on her whole posteritie, Whiche are condemned al, For theyr parentes iniquitie, And for theyr owne vnryght. Vnder this apple tree, through whiche thou wast condemnde, In whiche condemned state thy mother brought thee furth, I waked thee: for I, my lyfe and all contemnde, Vpon the tree dyd sheade my blood, Whiche all that take in wurth Are quit from sin, and newe made good In God my fathers syght. Vnder this apple tree, the swete tree of my crosse, So soone as thou dydst syt, and therein put thy trust, I waked thee from sin, I payed thy parentes losse: And got thy former state agayne, Whiche Eua by her lust Had lost: and dyd mankynde constrayne To slepe in sin and death. Among these apple trees, bothe bytter, swete, and sower, The apple tree of death, by whiche mankynde was lost, And tree of lyfe, whiche I dyd purchace by my power, I waked thee vp to lyfe and welth, Because I sawe the tost With waues of woe: and gaue the helth Agaynst thy sin and death. lxv. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Whan Christe hath tolde his Spouse howe he ascended for her sake, the apple tree of the crosse, makyng thereon ful satisfaccion to his father for the sinnes of al mankind by the sheadyng of his most precious blood, wakyng her vp, from the deadly slepe, whiche she slept vnder the apple tree of originall sinne and condemnacion, vnder whiche her mother brought her furth: He wyllyng to haue her myndeful of hys benefites byddeth her set hym as a seale vpon her harte, that is to seale vp all her affeccions and thoughtes, with the remembraunce of his blessed passion, and by the same to seale out al other deuices to obtayn saluacion: &amp; to set him as a signet vpon her arme, not to presume to doe ought by her owne wit, &amp; str?gth, but to doe in al thinges as his wurd teacheth: All this he desyreth her to doe for the loue sake which he beareth to her, whiche is strong as death or hel, yea and stronger: For the strength of his loue overcam the strength of bothe. Wherfore for this his great loue, he woulde haue his spouse thankfull, and shewe hym loue agayne: The properties wherof he declareth, syngyng. O set me as a seale vpon thyne hart, Remember me alwayes in all thy thought: Out of thy mynde (my spouse) let not depart, The wurthye wurkes whiche I haue for thee wrought. Remembre how that I alone dyd clyme The tree of death, to bryng thee vnto lyfe: And shed theron my blud to cleanse the cryme, For whiche the serpent fyrst began his stryfe. Whose myght my power doeth holde from doyng harme To thee, or them that in my merites trust: O let therfore in me thy feble arme With all thy strength continually be trust. Vpon thyne arme o set me as a seale, And as a bracelet bynde me all along: For loue as death, and eke the gelous zeale I beare to thee, as hell is myghtie strong. For whiche my loue I nought requyre agayne But thankfulnes, that maye my mercy moue: For all my zeale, my lyfe, my death, my payne, Nought I requyre saue only loue for loue. Whose coales are fyerye, and a very flame Sent of the Lorde: true loue is suche a fyer, That many waters can not quenche the same, No troubles can a faythfull louer tyer. Ne may the streames of persecucion drounde This earnest loue: yea yf a man woulde geue For loue all goodes, that in his house are founde, He woulde them all count nothyng I beleue. This loue therfore that is so strong and sure, Beare thou agayne to me that fyrste began: So shall my loue and zeale for aye endure, With thee and thyne, to further what I can. lxvi. The Spouse to Christe. The Argument. Whan Christe hath finished his song, his Spouse accordyng as he desyred, setteth hym as a seale at her heart, and as a bracelet about her arme: and than remembryng her sister whome she left whan she came to Christe, and desyrous through her preachyng to bryng her to Christe, doeth aske of Christe and his perfect frendes what she shall doe, singyng. We haue a sister young and small, Whome I dyd leaue behynde: Within the place where ye dyd call Me from my mother blynde. She is so young in Christes truthe That yet she hath no teates: She wanteth brestes to feede her youth With sounde and perfect meates. To our sister therfore so weake, What shall we doe, saye you: Whan we to her the wurdes shall speake Of Christes gospell true? I in my harte desyer ryght sore My sister rule to teache: What must we doe to her therfore, Whan we begyn to preache? lxvii. The Beloued to his Spouse. The Argument. Christe seyng the carefulnes of his Spouse for her yong sister, teacheth what must be doen to her, saying: If she be a wal, that is as sum take it elect, and yet not in the fayth: and as other sum take it, instructed in the faythe, but yet not perfecte, we wyll buylde vpon her a syluer bulwarke, that is accordyng to eleccion a strong and valiaunt fayth: &amp; according to fayth, the gyftes of the holy gost, as knowlege, vtterance, power to wurke myracles. &amp;c. whiche bothe agree well to the matter, but the last is moste nere, and proper. But yf she be an open dore, that is in state of grace, apte to receyue any kynde of doctrine, we wyll garnishe or fasten her with borders of cedre tree, with good doctrine, good bokes, good, constant and perfect preachers. whiche shall kepe her close from errour. Thus sayth Christ she must be doen by, singyng to his spouse as foloweth. Yf that thy sister be a wall, Vpon the same than buylde we shall A bulwarke of syluer, Yf that she be an open dore, We wyll her fasten close before With borders of Ceder. lxviii. The Younglynges to the Spouse. The Argument. The Younglynges hearyng what Christe sayde, answere that they are a wall, strong, constant, and able to kepe out errours, and wrong opinions: and beyng made his Spouse, sayeth she hath brestes lyke towers, well furnyshed with vytayles of good doctrine to succour and helpe them that nede. For the whiche properties they hauyng founde fauour in the syght of God, declare all to theyr sister, syngyng. A wall am I, Strong, thycke, and hye, In truthe I beare me bolde: And with the same, Myself I frame All errours to outholde. Also my brestes, where succour restes, Are lyke to towers strong, Whiche vitayled are, For to kepe warre, With all that would them wrong. Because I was A wall, and as The towers had brestes of myght Swete peace I founde, And doe abounde With fauour in Gods syght. lxix. Christe to his Spouse. The argument. Christe hauyng by fayth coupled all his Churches together, and made them all one vineyard, calleth to mynde the vineyarde which Kyng Salomon had at Baalhamon, a place nere Ierusalem: whiche vineyarde he let out to hyer, receyuyng of euery keper, a thousande pieces of syluer for the friucte. This story Christe counteth to his Spouse, that she maye know howe muche he loueth her better than Salomon dyd his, in that he wyll kepe her hym selfe: And geue to Salomon, that is euery peacefull person, an inestimable reward: and to the kepers, that are his byshoppes, two hundred and the fruite. (O happy kepers that shall be so rewarded.) This promis maketh he to his Spouse, syngyng. Of all the gydes that Israel euer had, In wyt, in welth, in peace, prince Salomon The chyefest Kyng, was not a litle glad Of a vineyard he had at Baalhamon. Whiche vineyard though it pleased his desyer, Yet at the length he let it furth to hyer To kepers suche, who yerely euery one Should for suche frute as they tooke thence away, Of syluer good a thousand pieces paye. Thus dyd this kyng with his beloued vine: But I contrary haue so great delyght, That I myself this vineyard of myne My churche I mean, wyll kepe styll in my syght: And vnto thee O salomon I geue, A thousande pieces for thy good beleue: Eke to them all that kepe my vine vpryght I geue two hundred, and the fruite to boote Of lyfe eterne, whiche spryngeth from the roote. If Salomon myght iustly well requier A thousande for his vineyarde let to hyer, Howe muche than is my churche nowe bounde to me, Who doe both paye, and also ouersee? lxx. Christe to his Spouse. The Argument. Whan Christe hath styrred vp his Churche to yelde hym thankes for his beneficiall diligence toward her, he stirreth her vp to preach, that his felowes, whiche are false christians, maye heare her true preaching, that beyng confounded therwith, they may c?uert and becum true christians in dede, syngyng to her as foloweth. Thou my spouse that doest excell In fayth all folke, and doest now dwell In scripture gardeyns whiche do smell Moste strong in sent: Lyke to a trumpe exalt thy voyce, With preachyng truth make suche a noyse, That I may hear it, and reioyce, That I thee sent. Preache out my wurde so loude and hye, That they whiche of my companye Doe boast themselues, but yet they lye, And loth my name: Maye hear thy voyce, and know how ferre They are from me, and how they erre From truth: to whiche thou shalte preferre Them, by the same. That it maye cum to passe at length, That all men doubtyng in theyr strength Maye to my mercy them submit: And so be fit, To be engraft in thee my stocke, That all maye be one faythfull flocke, With shepherdes therof other none, But only one. lxxi. The Spouse to Christe. The argument. The Churche commaunded of Christe to preache, willingly obeyeth. But because she knoweth her preachyng can take none effect without his help, she desyreth hym to depart from this worlde to heauen, and there to make intercession betwene God the father and her, and from thence to help her in all her affayers: She desyreth hym also to be as a Roe or harte vpon the swete smelling mountaynes, that is, to be alwayes quicke ready and swyft, in his Scriptures, that they may take effect when she preacheth them. This she desyreth of hym, syngyng as foloweth. To preache thy wurde thy felowes for to win, Suche felowes false as Christen folke them fayne, Loe prest I am: and gladly doe begyn, With preachyng truth, to thee them to attayne. But sith I know my labour shall be vayne Except thy help be present therwithall, Compeld therfore by force, loe I am fayne To flee to thee, for thy chefe ayde to call. Wherfore O Christe, whome euer loue I shal, Auoyde from earth to heauen, and remayne On Gods ryght hande, head father of vs all: And there of hym all grace for vs obtayne. And sende from thence thy sprite that may constrayne All folke through fayth, to gather to thy folde: That hypocrites theyr folly may refrayne, And be in dede, the same that seme they wolde. And whan that I suche secretes shall vnfolde As darkly hyd, the scriptures do contayne, That in the hartes of all they maye take holde, And to thy truth all vnbeleuers gayne, Lyke to a Roe or hart take thou the payne Vpon the mountaynes of thy wurde to dwell: And through thy power the hartes of all to trayne Vnto thy truth, that shall thy mountaynes smell. So shall my voyce all kynde of errours quel, So shall all men resort to thee amayne: So sin shall synke, so shall the power of hell, We ryd therfrom through fayth in thee, be slayne. So in the churche for aye, thou Lord shalt rayne, All Death shall dye through fayth of styngles sin: And we enioye that blisfull state agayne Whiche bought by thee, we wer created in. FINIS. Blessyng, honor, glory, and power, Be vnto God, for euer and euer. AMEN.</field>
