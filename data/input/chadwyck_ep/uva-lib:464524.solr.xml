      <field name="fulltext">(Hell, Purgatory, Heaven, World, Man, Sin, Grace, Virtue, Good works, God's Mercy, God's Justice). Alle-mighty god in trinite, fader and son &amp; holy gost, þat is one god &amp; persones thre, One sothfast lord of mightus most, Gyue vs grace synne to fle, and wel to lyue, &amp; kepe vs chaste; so þat oure soules redy be to god, when we þo deth shal taste. He may wel be calde witty þat can wel lyue in þis exille; who so here lyues rightwisely, he wirkes wel after gods wille. He þat mas hym to god redy and lyues wel, shal not die ille; &amp; alle oþer may be dredy, but he þat wel con lyue thorou skille. Alle oure lyue þat we here lede, is noght but a dethe lyuande; &amp; deth is noght ellis to drede but as a passing of lyue failande. For fro bigynnyng of oure childehede ilk day to dye we are dredande; þen þis [lif] is faylande at þo nede, for whils we here lyue [we] are dyande. Mony lyuen þate lyue kan noght, and mony dyen þate dar not dye; but of deth haue þai no thoght þat con lyue wel &amp; ese ay [f]lye. Thorou bodily deth þo gode are broght to ioye, &amp; no payne to drye; after þo werkus þate þai haue wroght alle shal be demed, witterlye. Deth is of endeles lyue bygynnyng, and of dedly lyue þo last ende, to þoo þate here are of gode lyuyng, when þai shal oute of þis world wende. Þen shal deth be to hom likyng þat in þis lyue made god hore frende; but hit is entrie of duellyng In helle to hom þate seruen þo fende. Wherfore, mon, if þou wilt lere to lyue wel, &amp; die rightly, &amp; of gode &amp; ille haue knowyng clere, and loue &amp; drede conceyue herby: wende oute iche day of þi-selue here thorou thoght, &amp; forgete þi body, and þen by-holde thre places sere In þat oþer world, of sere party. Þere shal þou se, if þou loke euen, Somme in ioye, &amp; somme in paynes stedde, &amp; here &amp; knowe by hore steuen what-wise þai haue hore lyue ledde. [Þ]o thre places I wil þe nemen, as I haue herd &amp; in boke redde: One is helle, an oþer is heuen, And purgatorye is þo thridde. Þese thre places, as we trowe, In þat oþer world, are certayne; to one of þese thre wende shalt þowe when deth has here þi body slayne. Þou shalt hethen wende &amp; wot not howe, &amp; neuer shalt þou come a-gayne: þerfore, or þou wende, chese þe nowe wheþer þou wolt to ioye or to payne. First, at helle þi thoght shal be, to se how synne is wirkid þare; and in purgatorie may þou se how synne is clensyd, with pynes sare; In heuen þou shalt se grete plente of blis þat shal last euer-mare, for hom þate are with hert fre for gode werkus wolde hom not spare. Þer-after byholde þo worldus lawe, how ful hit is of vanyte; &amp; sithen agayne þi thoght þou drawe In to þi-selue &amp; þi-selue se, &amp; what þou hast done &amp; what þou awe, And what god has done &amp; dos to þe: &amp; so may þou gode and ille knawe, and con lyue &amp; die and redy be. (Hell) First, if þou wilt con lyue right, þou shalt sende þi thoght to helle ones on þo day or on þo night þo while þou lyues, where fendus are felle: þere shalt þou se thorou gostly sight more sorow &amp; pyne þen tong may telle: for synful men are grymly dight þat for hore synnes þere shal þai duelle. Alle sorow þat monnus hert wolde fle þou shalt se with-Inne helle-?ate, and of alle woo grete plente, &amp; grete defaute, as clerkes wate. Fire þat neuer sleckid shal be is þere, with brymston brennande hate, þat al þo water in þo see, þof hit thorou-ran, ne myght hit bate. For as fire is hatter euerywhore þen is a fire paynted on a wowe: right so þo fire is hatter þore þen is þo fire here þat we knowe. ?it þere is siche colde euer-more, soche stormus þat euer shal blowe, þat if þo fire fast brennande wore, hit shuld sone turne to yse &amp; snowe. Þere is ay smeke, &amp; stynke a-mong, and marknes more þen euer was here; þere is hungur, thriste, and throng, &amp; vgly fendes of grete powere; þere is gretyng &amp; deulful song, gnastyng of tethe &amp; grisly chere, &amp; oþer tourmentis harde &amp; strong more þen hert may þink fer or nere. Þere is no hope of helpe ne rede to hom þate duellen in þat payne, ne non relef thorou no gode dede, for hit is endeles sorow souerayne. Þere is deth with-outen deede, &amp; lyue with-outen lyue, certayne; þai dye ay lyuande in þat stede, &amp; euer-more lyues &amp; dies agayne. Ouer al paynes þere haue þai a special sorow day &amp; nyght: of þo sight of blis þat lastes ay, þat oþer haue in heuen bryght, fro þo whilk þai are putt a-way, for þat þai here lyued not right; And þat shal last to domes-day, but fro þen þai shal want þat sight. Þat sight of blis confortis hom naght, but ekes hore sorow þat þai haue tane; thorou enuye þai haue hit kaght þat oþer has ioye &amp; þai haue nane. Þo leest payne þat hom is wraght In helle is more þat neuer shal wane, þen alle þo paynes in erth taght if þai were alle to-geder in ane. For alle þo paynes here as we duelle al-if þai to so mony wore, ?it þo lest payne in helle men saien a hundrid-folde is more; [f]or alle þo paynes sharpe &amp; felle of þis world, þat greuen here sore, solace &amp; ioy men might hom telle to regarde of þo lest payne þore. When þou hast sene þis hydowis place, &amp; þo sorow þat is þer-Inne, þou shalt haue drede, if þou haue grace, to do here ony dedly synne. For who so folowes þo fendes trace &amp; of his wickednes wil not blynne, but he amende hym whil he has space to payne of helle þai wil him wynne. Zit sende þi thoght forther-mare to purgatorye: where þou may se soules in brennande fire al bare for synne vnclensid, &amp; may not fle; In þat fire þai shal duelle þare til þai of alle synnes clensid be And made als clene as first þai ware when þai were baptised &amp; made fre. Þat payne of fire where þai duelle, is so mykel, to clense synnes sere, þat alle tourmentes sharp &amp; felle þat alle martirs han suffrid here, &amp; paynes þat wymmen when þai swelle of childeng thole þat to deth are nere, to þat pyne is not to telle but as a bathe of water clere. For þat fire is more mighty þen þis fire here, &amp; more brennande, as is þis fire erthly hatter þen þo sonne shynande. In þat fire brennus soules mony, And shal þer-Inne ay be duellande til þai ben clensid clene þer-by, as gold is founden in fire meltande. But þai haue ay gode hope in thoght oute of þat payne to wynne a-way, for þai wot wel þat þai are noght In helle, þer payne is lastande ay. But sum-tyme þai haue þis not in þoght, So harde payne is þer night &amp; day þat þai are oute of mynde broght &amp; con not think where are þai. Þai haue dowbul payne þere dight: One is feling of hore payne, An oþer hore letting of þat syght of god þat is ioy souerayne; þat ?erne þai euer day &amp; night, but þai may not be certayne til þai be made clene &amp; bright of al þat þai haue done in vayne. Þus may þou þere thorou gostly e se harde peynes on sere manere, þat þo lest payne is more to drye þen þo most payne of þis lyue here. Þer-fore clense þe here or þou dye, thorou penaunce of alle þi synnes sere; for ellis þou shalt, with-outen lye, In purgatorie bye hom ful dere. Afterwarde þi hope vp lede &amp; lyft þi hert holy to heuen. Þere shalt þou se, if þou take hede, more ioye þen erthly men con nemen. Alle clerkes þat on boke con rede, &amp; maisters of alle þo science seuen, þo ioye þat þere is &amp; þo mede mighten not think ne shewe with steuen. Þere is ay grete fulnes of lyght, &amp; largenes of roume with-outen prese, mirthis þat passen alle mennus sight, &amp; perfite loue þat neuer shal cese; þere is souerayne sikernes dight, &amp; siker pasibulnes &amp; pese, paysibul ioye with likande sight, &amp; ioyful scilence with ese. Þere is cely endeles beyng, and endeles blis in þat place, And likyng &amp; endeles loouyng, and thonkyng of mercy &amp; of grace.... Þere is al maner welth endeles, &amp; of alle delites grete plente; þere is flowyng of more riches þen euer was here, by mony degre; þere is more wurship of heghnes þen euer might eghen in þis world se; þere is alle þing þat gode is, &amp; wantyng of alle þat yuel may be. Þere are medes of halowes sere— þat ioye no mon mesure may; þere are so mony ioyes, þat no mon here may hom recken nyght ner day; þai are so preciouse &amp; so dere, and of so mykel nowblay, and so plentiuous on sere manere, þat no mon hom may gesse ne say. Þere is lyue with-outen deth dight, þo wille is euer-more lastande; þere is ?outh with-outen elde right, &amp; rest with-outen swi[n]k folowande; þere is with-outen merknes light, and ioye þat euer-more bes duellande; þere is ay day &amp; neuer nyght, &amp; pes with-outen stryue holdande. Þere is light &amp; bryghtnes more þen euer had sonne when he bright shone; &amp; þere is grete myrthe, as I saied ore, and melodie þat neuer shal wone. So mykel ioye &amp; so mony are þore þo whilk þai haue þat þider are gone, þat alle þo clerkes here of lore Kouthe not telle þo lest poynte of one. For þo lest ioye þat is in heuen of alle þo ioyes þat are sere, is a hundrid-folde more [to] neuen þen al þo ioy of þis lyue here; for al þo melodie of monnus steuen, &amp; delites fer and nere, were noght but sorowe to telle euen al to þo leste ioy of heuen clere. Þerfore, when þou hast hom sene thorou eghe-sight of hert fre: at þi synnes þou shalt sore tene þat putten þe fro þat faire cite. For al-þof helle neuer shulde haue bene, &amp; synne shulde neuer vengyd be, ?it shuldes þou ?erne to kepe þe clene þat ioy to haue &amp; god to se. What mon wolde tyne þat ioy &amp; þat blis, if he oght of hym-selue wolde rewe, þat god has hight to alle his þat in his seruys here are trewe? for sikerly, I dar saie þis, gyue a mon þat ioy right knewe, hym were leuer, þen hit to mys, Ilk day to be slayne here newe.— When þou thorou thoght of þi hert fre (World) hast sene þo ioye: þou shalt loke downe &amp; biholde þis world with his fals gre þat worldly to serue are bowne; þo whilk is ful of vanite, of wretchidnes &amp; corupcioune; þen shal hit seme no?t ellis to se but as a depe, dymme dungeoune. For hit shal seme þen to þi sight merke &amp; layth, litel &amp; lawe, to regarde of heuen so bright þat þou so faire &amp; bright sawe: hit shal seme voied of alle gode right þat monnus hert might to likyng drawe, to regarde of þo plente dight of heuenly godes þat are to knawe. Alle worldly riches bothe more &amp; lesse þe shal [þink] foule as muk stynkande, to regarde of heuenly richesse þat are so faire &amp; neuer faylande; Al þo ioye &amp; al þo gladnes shal be sorow for sothe semande, to regarde of þo ioy þat es In heuen with-outen ende lastande. Alle þo witt of þis world to lere þe shal þen þenk aperte foly, to regarde of þo sightes sere þat are in heuen with melodye.... Alle wurships of þis world here wast shame &amp; sheneship shal seme to þe, to regarde of þo wurship maste In heuen þere we fayne wolde be; Alle þat þo world ?ernes in haste þe shal þink vayne &amp; vanite, to regarde of alle þinges to taste þat fallen to heuen þat we wolde se. If þou byholde on þis wise þo world when þou þus hit has sene, þat fals is &amp; ful of fayntise And euer deceyueabul has hit bene: þat sight shal make þe to dispise &amp; forsake þis world be-dene, and tent to god &amp; his seruyse, &amp; fro synne here to kepe þe clene.— When þou þus has sene heuen &amp; helle, Purgatorie, ioy &amp; payne, &amp; þo fals world þer we duelle þat summe men louen &amp; seruen in vayne: biholde þi-selue þen, flesshe &amp; felle, and þis lyue [here] vncertayne, &amp; when þou hast done as I telle, wende þen in to þi-selue agayne. &amp; be-thenk þe what wast þowe, And wheþen þou come in þi hert caste; &amp; think also what þou art nowe,— &amp; þat þou be in thoght stedfaste!—; And what þou shalt be think &amp; trowe, &amp; whider þou shalt wende atto laste: for þi lyue here, I dar a-vowe, is noght but a wyndes blaste. First þou shalt thynk &amp; know in thoght what þou [was] first or þou come here. Sum tyme was when þou was noght, to fele ne se, fer ne nere; sithen þou was conceyued &amp; wroght On catif, wlatsome manere. Þenk on hym þat þe dere boght, &amp; þat þou shalt not ay lyue here. And whethen þou come, þink also: fro þi moder wombe ful right, Oute of a wlatsome stynkande wro þat was al merk with-outen light. Þen was þou waike &amp; myght not go, &amp; nakid &amp; pore, with-outen might; þou broght no-þing with þe þerfro but a foule skyn al blody dight. Þenk what þou art now, &amp; se þou art al stynk &amp; slayme with-Inne, and a seckeful of muk pryue, þat is couerde with þat foule skynne. Fouler filthe may not here be þen of þe comes bothe thycke &amp; thynne; þer come non oþer fruyt of þe but onely filthe, stynk, &amp; synne. For if þou se on ilk party what comes thorou mouthe &amp; what thorou nese, &amp; what thorou oþer places of þi body when þe list here þi body ese: A fouler myddyng of vilanye þou saw neuer in lond of pese þen þou art with-Inne nomely; þen has þou matir, of pride to cesel Thenk where þou art, &amp; knowe in haste þou art here in an exille sene, þat is þis world þat somme louen maste, þat fikul is and ay has bene; þou art in a dale of deol to taste, ful of trauel, traye &amp; tene; þou art as in a wyldernes waste, fulle of libardus &amp; lyons kene. Þou art as in a forest duellande, fulle of robburs &amp; of theues; þou art as [in] a see flowande, ful of wawus &amp; stormes þat greues; þou art as [in] a noen brennande, ful of fire of synne þat cleues: þou art as in an vncouth lande, ful of angurs &amp; myscheues. Þou art as in a felde of bataile, where þou byhoues with enmyes fight; but þere thre wil þe hardest a-saile: þi flesshe, þo fende, þo world right: þai wil not leeue for no trauaile þe to asaile bothe day &amp; night— If þou fight fast, þou shal not faile to ouer-come hom thorou gostly might. Think also what þou shalt be, when þou shalt wende heþen a-way. Þou shalt be wormes mete to se, Roten erth &amp; stynkande clay. Þo dethe shal come to assaile þe when me[r]cie fayne woldest þou pray; but non abyding wol he graunt þe of his comyng, night ne day. Whider þou shalt, bithynk þe ?itt and for þi wendyng þou ordayne. Oute of þis world þou shalt flitt, And neuer after come a-gayne; þi body shal in to a pitte, þou art not of þi soule certayne, whider hit shal wende þou may not witte, wheþer hit shal to ioy or to payne. Þus al þi lyue &amp; þi lyuyng is ful of synne &amp; sorowes sere. How may þou þen laghe or syng In siche a lyue, &amp; make gode chere? me þink þe aght haue no likyng, ne make no ioy þo whils þou art here, &amp; lyue [in] drede and haue ?ernyng to endeles lyue þat most is clere.— Al afterward bi-thynk þe right what god has done &amp; did for þe, and what he dos þe day &amp; night On mony wise as þou may se, what he shal do þe thorou his might &amp; in his mercie þi helpe shal be: þen may þou knowe thorou hym in sight how mighty &amp; how gode is he. Þou shalt thynk first in þi thoght what kyndenes god has for þe done. First, for þe heuen &amp; erth he wroght, water &amp; ayre, sonne &amp; mone, &amp; bestus &amp; trees þat fruyt forth broght for þi profett he ordeyned sone; þi-selue, mon, he made of noght;— on his werkus þou thynk ful sone! Þenk when þou was dampned to helle for synne, he boght þe þen agayne, for þe he come in erth to duelle, &amp; suffrid harde passion &amp; payne; for þe he hade sore woundes &amp; felle, for þe his body was rent &amp; flayne. And if þou wilt his woundes telle, here may þou se þo noumbur certayne: Fyue thousande woundes, as I wene, &amp; fully foure hundred &amp; sixty for þe he tholed &amp; ?it fiftene, In honde, in hed, in fete, in body; fro þo crowne of þo hed noght was sene to þo soule of þo fote but al blody. At þo last he died, ellis had þou bene dampned to helle with-outen mercie. Think what god dos þe ay: and how on mony sere manere he saues þe here bothe night &amp; day fro al meschaunce &amp; perels sere; he sendes þe grace wher-thorou þou may wynne with strength þi lyuyng here, And in al þat þou shalt do or say he gyues þe strength &amp; witt clere. When þou shalt ony þing bygynne, with-outen god þou may not spede; þou may nouþer go ne rynne, ne do no þing, but he þe lede, ne stir honde ne fote, lyppe ne chynne, ne no lym with-outen hym in nede; for what so þou dos, with-outen synne, Onely may hit be calde his dede. Ilk day for þe &amp; þi mete he multiplies of his godenes foules &amp; fisshes, smale &amp; grete, sere bestus, trees, fruyte &amp; gres; for þe he sendes bothe drye &amp; wete, sum-tyme more &amp; sum-tyme lesse, &amp; sum-tyme colde &amp; sum-tyme hete, þat most to þe sesenabul es. At þo last, what he shal do to þe thenk when þou art went heþen away. If þou hym loue with hert fre &amp; serue hym treuly here to pay, he wil þe bring to þat contre þer neuer is nyght but euer is day, where þou shalt more ioy &amp; blis se þen euer hert might think or tong say. Þat contre is his kyngdome, of whiche he wil þe his aire make if þou þo fende here ouer-com thorou gode lyue &amp; synne forsake. Bot if þou to god be vnbuxom &amp; wickednes of synnes take, þou shalt wende for þat wicke custom to helle, þere payne shal neuer slake. Þer-after þenk, &amp; for-gete noght, what synne þou has done &amp; what foly: what vnkyndenes þou hast wroght &amp; what dispite til god al-mighty, and what sheneship þou has thoght to þin oune soule, &amp; vilanye, &amp; what harme &amp; wrong þou hast wroght &amp; done to þi neghtbur þe by. Think what vnkyndenes, if þou mene, þou hast to god done, &amp; dispite: first how vnbuxum þou hast bene to his byddynges, vmthink þe ?ite how þi loue is to hym noght sene, &amp; has not serued [hym] with delite, but greued hym oft with werkus vnclene; of þin vnkyndenes þou art to wite. Also what shame &amp; vilanye þou dost þi soule bithink þe swithe: how foule þou mast hit &amp; vggely thorou synne þou dost here mony sithe, how pore, how nakid, how nedy of alle þing þat shuld make hit blithe.... Thenk what harme þou hast don &amp; skathe to hym þat was þi neghtbur kidde, in body, in soule, or ellis in bathe, thorou sklaunder, if hit so bitidde, or on oþer wise has made him wrathe. Make hym amendis if þou þus didde, or ellus þi soule is in grete wathe; for no þing may fro god be hidde.— More ?it bihoues þe know &amp; se &amp; haue in mynde in ilk a stede, what synne bifore þi dede dos þe þo whiles þou here on erth may trede, &amp; what harme to þe synne may be when þou shalt [dy, &amp;] after þi dede; so shalt þou synne hate &amp; fle, þen were þis a siker rede. First know &amp; think what dos synne bifore þi deth whil þou lyues. Synne woundes þi soule with-outen dynne, &amp; sore oft-sith hit [þe] greues; synne makes þi conscience foule with-Inne, &amp; iche synne with oþer clyues; synne mas god &amp; þe to twynne, &amp; puttes to mony foule vnthewes. Synne dos þe to folow þo fendus trace, &amp; alle þi dedis makes thonkles; synne reeues þe gostly solace, &amp; vertu? þat passen al riches; synne waste[s] alle þi godes of grace, &amp; leeues þe voide of al godenes; synne mas þe here helle to purchace, to haue at þo last, þer ay payne es. Thenk also &amp; þou may lere wh[at] synne dos þe at þi deth stoure: Synne [priues] þe þen of þi lyue here, of alle welthe, might, of honoure; for solace ne ioy on no manere Getes þou after ner no fauoure, but endeles paynes &amp; sorowes sere, but þou þe a-mende of al erroure. Synne pynes þi soule also of þi body with mikel care, &amp; of þai to helle to-gedur go þi body so faire shal be neuer mare; for at þo metyng of hom two þi soule shal se þi body so vgly fare þat siche a body as he went fro fayne wold he haue roten þof hit ware. Vnderstonde also &amp; þenk right what synne shal do after þi deed: Synne shal þen draw þe fro þat sight of god, and fro his sone bes þou sheed; Synne shal reeue þi soule of al might, &amp; make hit wayke &amp; heuye as leed; synne shal put þe fro rest &amp; light, &amp; fro alle mercie, helpe &amp; reed. Synne shal to endeles payne þe lede In helle þat hidowus is and myrke; Synne shal þe put fro al gode dede þat þou here wroght or euer wold wirke; Synne shal put þe fro al mede &amp; fro al þo helpe of holi kirke. Þus shal synne do, but þou god drede &amp; forsake synne &amp; with hit irke.— Afterward think in þi thoght what grace shal do þat noght may fayle, &amp; what vertue thorou grace is wroght, &amp; what gode werk may þen availe. And when þou hast þes thre wel thoght: with hom þou shalt þi soule vitayle, &amp; of alle þo synnes þou euer wroght make amendes thorou gode consaile. First þou shalt þenk &amp; vnderstonde with stedfast thoght &amp; hert stabul what grace may do þe here lyuande, if þou to grace wilt make þe abul. Grace settis þi wille in god lastande, and makus þe to hym acceptabul; grace may make þi hert heldande to þat þat is most prophetabul. Grace þo boundes of synne wil slake, and fully light þi hert with-Inne; grace may make þe for gods sake to suffur angers &amp; þi lyue wynne; Grace may þi werkis medeful make, &amp; gete þat lost is thorou synne; grace wil gare þe þo right way to take to heuen þer blis shal neuer blynne. Thynk also ay when þou may what vertue dos &amp; what hit spedis. Vertue puttis foundyng away, and multiplies alle gode dedis; vertue makus [þe] night &amp; day to haue likyng in god þat þi soule fedis; vertue in charite holdes þi-selue ay, And holly to god hit þi loue ledis. Vertue þe kepis fro fire brennyng, fro helle hardships &amp; fro payne, fro lecherie, lust &amp; lykyng, þat þou noght in hom drunken be; vertue þe kepis fro fallyng, In alle nedis he vp-holdes þe, &amp; drawes þi hert fro dyuers þing, fro coueytise &amp; vanyte. Think also day &amp; night what gode werk dos þat is right wroght. Gode werk stablis vertue right, &amp; ekus þi mede, &amp; glades þi thoght; gode werke away puttus slouth thorou right, &amp; fordos synne þat þou art Inne broght; gode werk strengthis þe so to fight with þo fende, þat he þe ouer-com noght. Gode werk þat wroght is in charite, is holden medeful &amp; certayne, &amp; specialy to þinges thre: þat is, to endeles lyue souerayne, &amp; to þo ekyng of grace so fre, and also to forgyfnes of payne. &amp; þus may gode werk vaile to þe, if þou with charite hit ordayne. But gode werk, shalt þou vnderstonde, oute of charite may noght a-vayle As to þo lyue ay-lastande; but to one of þes foure hit shal not fayle: Ouþer hit shal sonner breke synne bande, or leese þo sorow þat þe shulde ayle, or make þi welth more here flowande, or more lett þo fende þe to assayle. (Gods mercy) Euer-more þink how mykel is of god godenes of his mercy, &amp; of þo harde dome of his rightwisnys how mykel hit is on oþer party; &amp; þat shal make þe to loue lesse worldus welth þat passis lightly, &amp; forsake honoure &amp; richesse, &amp; wel more drede god al-myghty. Mercie shewes sere benefises þat men receyue of god here: Mercy delyuers a mon &amp; saues (!) fro strong perels þat mon is nere, Mercy here to mon hetes heuen delices &amp; to alle þat to god are leue &amp; dere, mercy vs confortis on sere wyses when we are broght in synnes sere. Of mercy god vs here abides [suffrandly] when we do wronge, of mercie fro vengaunce he vs hides &amp; gyues vs grace here frely a-monge, of mercie he multiplies on mony sides þat he gyues, where-sere we gonge, of mercy he kepis vs what so bytides þat has ben ordayned to last longe. Of mercie god wil agayne-calle mon þat turnes fro hym to ille, of mercie he receyues hom alle þat turne agayne to hys wille, Of me[r]cy he makis oure hertis smalle and meke penaunce to fulfille; of mercy þis shuld to hym falle to forgyue vs, þat we not spille. Of mercy god sendes angers sere for synne shuld be clensid þer-by, of mercy he gyues vs welth here to gare vs to loue hym of curtesy, of mercy he gyues vs with-outen were Sacramentis, to take wurthily, of mercy he wil þat we lere his comaundements, for mede gostly. Of mercy god led[is] hom agayne þate wronge went day &amp; nyght, of me[r]cye—þat is certayne— he ledis hom þat han no lyght, Of mercye to helpe vs he is fayne when we are fallen &amp; wanten myght, of mercy þat wil he not layne he hom vp-holdes þat stonden vp-right. Also þenk with hert stedfast, when þou wost what gods mercye is, how mykel shal be, in þi hert cast, þo reddir of his rightwisenes to þoo þat shal be at þo last On domes-day [demed] more &amp; les After þo dredeful bemes blast, as tellis þo gosple in þo mes. Þen shal god his mercye hide fro synful men þat are gilty, his rightwisnes þai shal abide, &amp; þai be [dampned] þat be wurthy; þen shal þai stonde on his [left] side with-[outen] hope of alle mercy, And helle opende shal be wide &amp; swalow þat synful company. For þai hade no reuth on þo pore þat for myscheeue might for hom spille. ne to hore owen neghtbore mercy [did] here with gode wille, þai shal be dampned thorou reddoure rightwysnes þen to fulfille, &amp; [haf] endeles woo with-outen mesoure with-outen mercye, &amp; þat is skille. Rightwisnes with mercy is ay In alle gode werkus, as shewes he; but sum-tyme þat one is by sum way aperte, when þat oþer is priue, &amp; sum-tyme bothe se men may, &amp; sum-tyme nouþer may þai se: but rightwisnes [in] þo last day bes shewid, &amp; mercie hidde shal be. Mercye is shewid, as I wene, and rightwisnes priue &amp; stille, when þo wicked of synne is made clene, &amp; so is rightwis[ed] thorow gods wille. But rightwisenes is openly sene &amp; mercy hidde for certayne skille, when childre vncristened dampned bene to helle for ay, þat neuer did ille. And rightwisnes with mercye tite are bothe hidde &amp; holden doune, when innocente? &amp; men perfite suffren here persecucioune. But bothe are shewid in a plite, þof þai haue sere condicioune, when god þo gode hore mede shal qwite, &amp; to þoo ille payne &amp; dampnacioune. For god to þo gode grauntis more mede in heuen þen þai haue serued fully, &amp; to þo ille for hore mys-dede lesse payne in helle þen þai ben worthy. Þis is grete godenes of god to rede þat þus dos of his grete mercy. Þere þus shal mercye here of spede thorou grace of god, ouer al mighty, if mon serue god &amp; paynes drede &amp; to endeles blis hym dight redy. If god schuld ?elde to ilk man After þo werkes þat þai haue wroght, gode for gode as he wel kan, &amp; ille for ille fully thoght, fro þo tyme þai lyue bigan, of alle werkus, wylle, worde or thoght: Þo rightwisnes of god bes þan Onely shewid, &amp; mercye noght. And þerfore chese þe, or þou wende, wheþer þou wolt to payne or blis. But if þou puruyaunce by-fore sende til þat place þat redy is, with gode dedes þi lyue amende, ellis comes þou neuer þer al ioye is, but euer to duelle with þo fende, dopartyd fro god and fro alle his.— For his loue on rode con blede &amp; boght monnus soule vnto blis, on þis boke takes gode hede &amp; reulis ?ow after rightwisnys. he þat loues god &amp; hym wol drede, mon &amp; wommon, more &amp; lesse, to þat blis he wil ?ou lede þere ioy &amp; blisse euer es. amen. per C[harite]. mea tua. (2 poems on subjects in the Prick of Conscience.) 1. Of þo flode of þo world. Grete ferly hit is why men þat fraysten þo world, so mykel þer-Inne traysten, And so mykel hit louen &amp; folowen in vayne, þat is so vnstable &amp; so vncertayne; wher-Inne noon eese ne rest siker es, But angres &amp; trauayle &amp; bysynes; of whilk þo wysdome is noght but foly, ne þo wurship anente god but vilany; Ne þo welthe of þo world is noght but gyle, And þo ioy of hit lastis but a whyle. þo world chases a mon to &amp; froo, now to weele now to woo, fro ioy to sorowe, fro tene to gamen— þus mengis hit weele &amp; woo ay samen. Þo world makus a mon to ryse &amp; falle, And chulles hym as men don a balle þat is casten fro hande to hande— þus dos þo world with men here lyuande. Þen here is noght ellis, as men sees, but sere bysynesse &amp; vanytees. (space of 9 lines left vacant.) To mony sere þingis, if men wille, Men may licken þo world by skille, but to no þing may hit lickened be more propurly þen to þo se. For þo see ilk day or ilk nyght ones ebbis &amp; floes, waxes &amp; wones; In whilk rysen mony grete wawes thurgh stormes of wedres &amp; wyndis þat blawes. And men may lickened be þat þo world louen, to fisshes þat in þo see swymmen &amp; houen. Mony sere fisshes lyuen in þo se, of sere kynde &amp; þat grete plente, of whilk summe are more &amp; summe are les, þat swymmen &amp; houen as hore kynde es; summe swymmen abouen among þo wawes, And summe doune to þo grounde drawes; Summe fisshis haue siche strength &amp; myght þat þai may agayne þo flode swymme ryght, summe fisshis are dryuen to &amp; fro, summe folowes þo flode as hit wil go; Summe haue most likyng to be where most filthe gedris of þo se, As in mudde &amp; gruttis &amp; in skum, þat to oþer fisshis is vnholsum. Þo see is strong, when hit is flowande vnethis may oght agayne hit stande; And so depe þat passe hit may no mon but in ship with shippe-men þat kon thurgh witt &amp; wisdom hit gouerne &amp; lede, &amp; ?it sumtyme þai are in greet drede And in perel thorgh stormes &amp; wyndus blastes, þat þo ship vp &amp; doun with wawes kastes. Þus who so in ship passis þo se, In perille &amp; drede oft may be. Right þus faris þo world for certayne: hit ebbis &amp; floes &amp; fallis agayne. Þo world floes in richesse &amp; vanytees to men of sere states, as men oft sees: for when richesse &amp; welthe heghes a man, þo world as flowand hym vp-beris þan; but þo wawes of þo world weltren to &amp; froo &amp; kesten a mon now to wele nowe to wo; þo world bigynnes to ebbe &amp; to withdrawe fro a mon when he fallis fro hegh state to lawe. Whe[n] a mon is at myscheue &amp; happlesse, þo world to hym at þo grounde-ebbe þen es; when he is risen heghe thorou worldly gode, þen is þo world to hym at fulle flode. And as fisshis swymm?n aboute in þo se, so don men in þo world aboute vanyte; for fisshis swymmen sekande al þing In whilk þai haue most loue &amp; likyng: Right so worldly men in þo world trauayles aboute worldly þing þat passes &amp; fayles. And al worldly þing is noght but vayne, for hit is vnsiker and vncertayne. Summe men vpward in þo world swymmes And þoo are men þat to heghe state clymmes, As to office &amp; dignyte &amp; grete powere, For to haue maystry of oþer &amp; worship here; þat aboute pompe of þo world wil spende largely, for men shulde hom comende. Summe in þo depe of þo world swymmes dounward &amp; þoo are auarouse men of hert hard, þat worldly godes to-gedre gettes &amp; hore hertis þeron settes, So þat þai neuer-more uowche-saue to parte with no gode þat þai haue nouþer to god ne to mon here, ne spende hom in þo world on oþer manere, And of noght ellis but on hore gode þinkis: þoo drunken in þo flode of þo world &amp; synkis; hit is right þat soche men duelle with þo riche mon biryed in helle. Summe agayn þo flode of þo world swymmen hard &amp; þoo are vnbuxom men &amp; froward to god &amp; mon &amp; to hore soueraynes &amp; are agayne þat holy kirc ordaynes, And ay are grucchand &amp; vnpacient In angres when any to hom are sent. Summe swymmen with þo flode of þo world as hit gas: þoo are men þat flateryng &amp; fawenyng mas to lordis namely in hore presence, Agayne sothfastnesse &amp; gode conscience; For bothe in wrong &amp; in right þai plese ay, to lordis namely, &amp; sayen al as þai say, &amp; if þai wil do wrong þai assent þerto, &amp; saien al is wel don þat þai do. Þerfore lite may now with lordis duelle but þoo þat kon conraye fawenelle. Summe in filthe &amp; in mudde in þo world houen: þoo are men þat lust &amp; likyng louen, &amp; seken al þo eese þat þai may take, And liste not trauel for gods sake, but lyen &amp; lurken in hore synne stille— soche men are slowe &amp; of ille wille. Summe swymmen vp &amp; doun, to and froo: þoo are men þat nouþer kun thole weele ne woo, In no sted con þai rest ne duelle, but stirten about ay as a squyrelle, for þai may no while in one sted laste— soche are vnstable men &amp; vnstedfaste. Summe thorou wawes of þo world are weltrid ouer fro welthe to myscheue, &amp; may not couer; Summe þo flode of þo world castis fro waw to wawe, vp &amp; doune, nowe heghe now lawe: þoo are men þat are greetly taryde with bysynesse &amp; angres on ilk syde; For þoo þat to swymme in þo flode are leue, þo wawes sumtyme casten to myscheue, And so summe in þo world þat semen sleghe, are casten doun when þai are cloumben heghe, &amp; when þai are rysen abouen &amp; are fayne, also-sone þai are casten doune agayne. Þus swymmen men in þo world aboute as þo fisshes in þo see don in grete doute, And namely worldly men swymmen þus, &amp; as fisshis þai are naked of grace &amp; of vertuus. Vp-on þo flode of þo world are fisshers sleghe: þat are wickid spiritis þat fallen fro heghe, þat fisshen aboute men bothe nightus &amp; dayes, &amp; hore nettis to take hom sleghly layes, And casten hokes to hom with lykande beyte, &amp; so take þai men thurgh deceyte. Hore nettis with hokes are trappis of synne þat men of þo world are combred Inne; &amp; hore beyte þat is likandly dight, is al þing þat men ?ernen thurgh sight: thurgh whilk likande beyte at þo last mony are tane &amp; holden fast, And to þo wicked fisshers hondis vp titte, &amp; at þo last doun kasten in to helle-pitte. But a shipe thorgh þo flode of þo world sayles, þat is laden ful of gods vitayles, In whilk are men þat of þo world are irke: &amp; þat shippe is noght ellis but holy kirke. Þer-Inne are dyuerse men of religion, and mony oþer of grete deuocion, þat to þo trouthe of holy kirc are lele &amp; with þo maners of þo world list not dele. For whils a mon folowes þo worlds wysdome, he may not in to þat ship come; And to þo hauen of lyue he may not wynne, but thurgh þis ship, if he be þer-Inne. Þis ship leedes holy men of deuocion euen to þo hauen of saluacion, thurgh al þo flode of þo world &amp; wawes, In alle þo stormes &amp; wyndes þat blawes, þat is to saye thurgh mony persecucions sere &amp; angres þat gode men tholen here. Summe in þis ship rowes, &amp; summe steres, And summe trauels þer-Inne on oþer maneres, þat is summe fastes &amp; praies, &amp; summe wirkis þo werkes of mercy &amp; neuer-more irkis. In myddis þo ship stondis a mast, þat no storme may stir hit stondis so fast: þis ilk mast is noght ellis to telle but Crist, þat boght mon-kynd fro helle, þat was drawen &amp; nayled on þo rode &amp; þeron for vs shed his hert-blode. þis mast has a brood saiel dight þerby: þat is noght ellis but his grace &amp; his mercy, with þo wynde of his myght þat fayles noght, thurgh whilk þis shyp to þo hauen is broght, þat is to þo blisful londe of lyue, where endeles pees is with-outen stryue. Þis ship thurgh þo flode of þo world gode beres, of whilk summe are made gods fissheres, þat casten hore nettes oft to þoo þat in þat flode swymmen to &amp; froo— for Crist to summe of his apostles spake And saied he wold hom fisshers make, “Comes, he saies, now after me, Venite post me: faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum. fissheres of men I shal make ?ou be”. But mony are so froward &amp; so vnbuxum þat to hore fissher nettus þai wil not cum; but summe comen in to þat nett at þo last, and þoo are taken &amp; holden fast, And alle þoo þat are so tane are drawen vp in to þo ship ilkane. Þese fisshers þat þus fisshen ouer þo ship borde, Are noght but þo prechours of gods worde, þat to men prechen þat here wrong lyuen &amp; to þo world &amp; delytes of flesshe hom gyuen; of whilk summe are stirrid hore synne to fle &amp; to forsake worldly vanyte &amp; drawen hom toward holy kirke where þai shal serue god &amp; gode werkis wirke. Þese nettes þat þai are taken Inne, are manasses &amp; snybbyngus of hore synne, And gode ensaumples þat in boke are sette, thurgh whilk þai are tane as fisshus thurgh nette In to þo ship of holy kirc, þat shal hom leede to þo lond of lyue &amp; blisful-heede where þai shal god face to face se als he is &amp; sittes in trynite, þat is heuen, where ay is blis &amp; likyng— to whilk londe louerd god vs bring. Amen. 2. Þo whele of fortune. Alle wandreths, welthis &amp; lykingis by chaunce of happe on þis lyue hyngis: For ilk mon wheþer he wake or slepe, In þis lyue byhoues his chaunce kepe, when hit sodenly fallis, be hit gode or ille; for he may not fle hit aftor his wille. Chaunce is couplid with þo world here as a wyue is with hir weddid fere, And dos al þat þo world bids as his houswyue, &amp; turnus vp &amp; doune a monnes lyue. Chaunce when hit comes so sodenly, Is so stalworthe &amp; so myghty, þat agayne-stonde hit may ful fone; &amp; þerfore may hit be cald fortune. Þis worde to vnderstonde is light, for af[t]or þo latyne hit sounes right, þat is to saie þus, fortuna; but hit is in frenshe wordis twa: fort, &amp; vne, þat is on englis stalworthe, &amp; one, þat bymenes þis, þat is to saie by vndurstondyng: Chaunce of þo world is a stalworthe þing; for þere may no mon in þis world lyuande, when sho comes so sodenly, agayne hir stande. Þo world is lord, &amp; sho is lady, to worldly men ouer whom þai haue maistry; &amp; for sho is þus lauedy, &amp; strong withalle, þerfore Dame Fortune men may hir calle. Þo strength of hir þat men may fele, þen may be lyckened vnto a whele. For a whele when hit turne[s] in-virowne, þat turned is vp is titt turned downe, &amp; þat is heghest is lowest turned sone. Þus fares hit by þo whele of fortune. Mony men where Dame Fortune suggurnes with hir whele of treuthe a-boute sho turnes: Summe turnes sho vp, summe turnes sho doune, sho spares none in felde ne in toune. Summe at þo heghest duellen a stounde, &amp; summe at þo lowest are casten to þo grounde; summe þat holden hom by hir whele sadly on þat one syde is turned vpward þerby, Summe þat aboue sitten in pompe &amp; in pride, are turned dounward on þat oþer side. As men may se here propurly &amp; fynde In a purtreyd figure ymagynde: In whilk figure is a quene stondande with a whele, foure kinges aboute turnande, Of whilk one with þo whele his course mas vpwarde, and an oþer dounwarde gas, þo thrid sittes abouen as he king ware, þo four[t]e liggis vndre þo whele naked &amp; bare; he þat gos vpward, saies “I regne shalle”, he þat gos dounward saies “I falle”, he þat is heghest saies “I regne nobly”, þo lowest saies “with-outen regne am I”. Þis figure of fortune þat is as fabul, bitokens þis lyue þat is vnstabul. Þo quene, þat men Dame Fortune calles, Is chaunce or happe þat in þo world falles. Hir whele is hir strengthe as men may fele, þat turnes summe to woo, &amp; summe to wele. Þo foure kyngis þeron turned aboute, are foure maner of men þat here lyuen in doute: One are þoo þat are bysye erly &amp; late &amp; ?ernen to clymbe here to heghe state; ?it are þai in doute, for al þat þai do, to fayle or falle er þai com þerto. Anoþer are þoo þat are heghe &amp; myghty &amp; ouer oþer hauen lordship &amp; maistry; &amp; ?it are þai in doute &amp; drede with-alle fro hore heghe state doune to falle. Þo thrid are þoo þat at hegh state han bene &amp; are put þerfro &amp; at lower are sene; And ?it þai drede, whiles þai lyue, to be put lower at more myscheue. Þo fourte are þoo þat are pure &amp; nedy &amp; noþing haue here to lyue by, and ?it þai are in greet doute &amp; drede thurgh defaute to perisshe in þat nede. Also by þese foure kyngus þus purtrayed may be vndurstonden openly &amp; sayed Of alle maner of men þo states, þat vp &amp; doune turnen mony gates and chaungen oft-sithes to &amp; froo, fro woo to weele, &amp; fro weele to woo; fro pouert to richesse þat is but vayne, and fro richesse to pouert doune agayne; fro angre &amp; sorowe to welthe &amp; lyking, And fro liking to sorowe &amp; angre in sum þing; fro sekenesse to heele &amp; cooueryng, &amp; fro heele to sekenesse &amp; throwyng; fro wayknesse to strengthe þat vpward es, and fro strengthe dounward to wayknes; Fro childe-heed to mon-heed vnto strength be maste, þat þen with-drawes hit, as olde men may taste, þat aye lesse &amp; lesse may hom-selue welde, &amp; so fare þai til þai com at þo last elde, And fro lyue to dethe byhoues hom falle, as þo last is &amp; lowest purtrayed of alle. Al þis may vnderstonden be in þo figure þat men may purtrayed se. Þus turnen alle states aboute as a whele, fro wele to woo &amp; fro wo to wele. And ay whil mennus statis þus turnen aboute, þai lyue ay here in grete drede &amp; doute. Þus are alle men in grete drede &amp; were when chaunce or happe comes to hom here. Þen semes in þis lyue þat we here lede, Is no ioye lastande with-outen drede, but woo &amp; wandreth and bysynesse: Þerfore god bryngis vs to þo blis endelesse. Amen.
