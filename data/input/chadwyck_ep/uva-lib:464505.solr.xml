Man og to luuen ðat rimes ren, ðe Wisseð wel ðe logede men, hu man may him wel loken ðog he ne be lered on no boken, Luuen god and seruen him ay, For he it hem wel gelden may, And to alle cristenei men beren pais and luue bi-twen; ðan sal him almightin luuen, Her bi-neðen and ðund abuuen, And giuen him blisse and soules reste[n] ðat him sal earuermor lesten. Ut of latin ðis song is dragen on engleis speche, on soðe sagen; Cristene men ogen ben so fagen so fueles arn quan he it sen dagen, ðan man hem telled soðe tale Wid londes speche and wordes smale, Of blisses dune, of sorwes dale; Quhu lucifer, ðat deuel dwale, [Brogt mankinde in sinne and bale] And held hem sperd in helles male til god srid him in manliched, dede mankinde bote and red, And unspered al ðe fendes sped, And halp ðor he sag mikel ned. Biddi hic singen non oðer led, ðog hic folgen idel-hed. Fader god of alle ðhinge, Almigtin louerd, hegest kinge, ðu giue me seli timinge To thaunen ðis werdes biginninge, ðe, leuerd god, to wurðinge, Queðer so hic rede or singe!

In firme bigini[n]g, of nogt Was heuene and erðe samen wrogt; ðo bad god wurðen stund and stede, ðis middes werld ðor-inne he dede, Al was ðat firme ðrosing in nigt, Til he wit hise word made ligt; Of hise word, ðu wislike mune, Hise word, ðat is, hise wise sune, ðe was of hin fer ear bi-foren Or ani werldes time boren; And of hem two ðat leue luuen, ðe welden al her and abuuen, ðat heli luue, ða[t] wise wil, ðat weldet alle ðinge wit rigt and [s]kil; Migt bat wit word wurðen ligt, (Hali froure welt oc ðat migt; for ðhre persones and on reed, On migt and on godfulhed.) ðo so wurð ligt so god it bad, fro ðisternesse o sunde[r] sad; ðat was ðe firme morgen tid, ðat euere sprong in werld wid. wið ðat ligt worn angles wrogt, And in-to newe heuene brogt, ðat is ouer dis walkenes turn, God hem quuad ðor seli suriurn; Summe for pride fellen ðeðen, In to ðis ðhisternesse her bi-neðen; Pride made angel deuel dwale, ðat made ilc sorge, and euerilc bale, And euerilc wunder, and euerilc wo, ðat is, or sal ben euere mo. He was mad on ðe sunedai, He fel out on ðe munendai; (ðis ik wort in ebrisse wen, He witen ðe soðe ðat is sen.) forð glod ðat firme ligt, And after glod ðat firme nigt; ðe daigening cam est a-gon, His firme kinde dei was a-gon, On walkenes turn wid dai and nigt Of foure and twenti time rigt; ðes frenkis men o france moal, it nemnen “un iur natural;” And euere gede ðe dai biforn, siðen ðat newe werld was boren, Til ihesus crist fro helle nam, His quemed wid eue and adam; sro ðat time we tellen ay, Or ðe nigt and after ðe day, for god ledde hem fro helle nigt to paradises leue ligt; ðo gan hem dagen wel iwisse, Quan god hem ledde in-to blisse. On an oðer dai ðis middel-erd, was al luken and a-buten sperd; ðo god bad ben ðe firmament, Al abuten ðis walkne sent, Of waters froren, of yses wal, ðis middel werld it luket al;— May no fir get melten ðat ys; He ðe it made is migtful and wis,— It mai ben hoten heuene-Rof; It hiled al ðis werldes drof, And fier, and walkne, and water, and lond, Al is bi-luken in godes hond, Til domes-dai ne sal it troken. Al middel-erd ðer-inne is loken, watres ben her ðer-under suuen, And watres ðor a-buuen; And ouer ðat so ful i-wis, An oðer heuene ful o blis, And ful o lif ðe lested oo, wo may him ben ðe fel ðor-fro. Forð glod ðis oðer dais nigt, ðo cam ðe ðridde dais ligt: ðe ðridde dai, so god it bad, was water and erðe o sunder sad; God bi-quuad watres here stede, And erðe brimen and beren dede; Ilk gres, ilc wurt, ilc birðheltre, His owen sed beren bad he; Of euerilc ougt, of euerilc sed, Was erðe mad moder of sped. ðe ðridde dai was al ðis wrogt, And erðes fodme on werldes brogt; An euerilc fodme his kinde quuemeðen. ðo was it her fair bi-neðen, God sag his safte fair and good, And bliscede it wid milde mood. Forð glod ðis dridde dais nigt, ðo com ðe ferðe dais ligt. ðe ferðe dai made migt Sunne, and mone, and ilc sterre brigt, walknes wurðinge, and erdes frame, He knowned one ilc sterre name, He sett es in ðe firmament, Al abuten ðis walkne went; ðe seuene he bad on fligte faren, And toknes ben, and times garen. Sunne and mone ðe moste ben, Of alle ðe toknes ðat men her sen; ðe mone is more bi mannes tale, ðan al ðis erðe in werldes dale; And egest swilc ðe sunnes brigt, Is more ðanne ðe mones ligt. ðe mones ligt is moneð met, ðor-after is ðe sunne set; In geuelengðhe worn it mad, In Reke-fille, on sunder shad; Two geuelengðhes timen her, And two solstices in ðe ger. On four doles delen he ðe ger, ilc dole of moneð ðhre; Euere schinen ðo toknes brigt, And often giuen is on erðe ligt; wel wurðe his migt lefful ay, ðe wrout is on ðe ferðe day! Forð glod ðis ferðe dais nigt, ðo cam ðe fifte dais ligt; ðe fifte day god made ywis of water, ilc fuel and euerilc [sic] fis, And tagte fuel on walkene his fligt, Ilc fis on water his flotes migt, And blisced hem, and bad hem ðen And tuderande on werld ben. Ðis fifte dai held forð his fligt, And forð endede ðat fifte nigt; And ðe sexte dais ligt, So made god wid witter migt, Al erue, and wrim, and wilde der, Qwel man mai sen on werlde her. God sag bi-fore quat after cam, ðat singen sulde firme adam, And him to fremen and do frame, He made on werlde al erue tame, ðe sulde him her, in swinkes strif, to fode, and srud, to helpen ðe lif; And him to pine, and loar her, God made wirme and wilde der. He pine man wid sorwe and dred, And don hem monen his sinfulhed, ðat is him loar quan he seð, ðan he for sinne in sorwe beð. Ilk kinnes erf, and wrim, and der Was mad of erðe on werlde her, And euerilc on in kinde good, ðor quiles adam fro sinne stod; Oc der and wrim it deren man fro ðan ðat he singen bi-gan; In ðe moste and in ðe leste he forles, His louered-hed quuanne he mis-ches; Leunes and beres him wile to-dragen, And fleges sen on him non agen; Hadde he wel loked him wið skil, Ilc beste sulde don his wil; Erf helpeð him ðurg godes með, His lordehed ðor-onne he seð. And for hise sinne oc he to munen, ðat moste and leiste him ben binumen. Ðis sexte dai god made Adam, And his licham of erðe he nam, And blew ðor-in a liues blast, A liknesse of his hali gast, A spirit ful of wit and sckil; ðor quuiles it folgede heli wil, God self ðor quile liket is, An un-lif quuanne it wile mis. [I]N feld damaske adam was mad, And ðeðen fer on londe sad; God bar him in-to paradis, An erd al ful of swete blis; fol wel he wid him ðor dede, bi-tagte him al ðat mirie stede; Oc an bodeword ðer he him forbed, if he wulde him silden fro ðe ded, ðat he sulde him ðer loken fro A fruit, ðe kenned wel and wo, And hiegt him ded he sulde ben If he ðat bode-word ne gunne flen. God brogt adam ðor bi-forn Ilc kinnes beste of erðe boren, and fugel, an fis, wilde and tame, ðor gaf adam ilc here is name; Ne was ðor non lik adam. God dede dat he on sweuene cam, And in ðat sweuene he let him sen Mikel ðat after sulde ben. Ut of his side he toc a rib, And made a wimman him ful sib, And heled him ðat side wel ðat it ne wrocte him neuere a del. Adam abraid, and sag ðat wif, Name he gaf hire dat is ful Rif; Issa was hire firste name, ðor-of ðurte hire ðinken no same; Mayden, for sche was mad of man, Hire first name ðor bi-gan; Siðen ghe brocte us to woa, Adam gaf hire name eua. Adden he folged godes red, Al man-kin adde seli sped; for sinne he ðat blisse for-loren, ðat derede al ðat of hem was boren; It is her-after in ðe song, Hu adam fel in pine strong. Forð glod ðis sexte dais lig[t], After glod ðe sexte nig[t]; ðe seuendai morgen spro[n]g, ðat dai tokenede reste long; ðis dai was forð in reste wrogt, Ilc kinde newes ear was brog[t]; God sette ðis dai folk bitwen, Dai of blisse and off reste ben, for ðat time ear fear bi-forn, Til ihesus was on werlde boren, And til he was on ðe rode-wold, And biried in ðe roche cold. And restede him after ðe ded, ðat ilke dai god aligen bed. Siðen for-les ðat dai is pris, for ihesus, god and man so wis, Ros fro ded on ðe sunenday, ðat is forð siðen worðed ay; And it sal ben ðe laste tid, Quan al man-kinde, on werlde wid, Sal ben fro dede to liue brogt, And seli sad fro ðe forwrogt, An ben don in blisse and in lif, fro swinc, and sorwe, and deades strif. Wisdom ðe made ilc ðing of nogt, quuat-so-euere on heuone or her is wrogt. Ligber he sridde a dere srud, An he wurðe in him-seluen prud, An wið ðat pride him wex a nyð, ðat iwel weldeð al his sið; ðo ne migte he non louerd ðhauen, ðat him sulde ðhinge grauen: “Min fligt,” he seide, “ic wile up-taken, Min sete norð on heuene maken, And ðor ic wile sitten and sen Al ðe ðhinges ðe in wer[l]de ben, Twen heuone hil and helle dik, And ben min louerd geuelic. ðo wurð he drake ðat ear was knigt, ðo wurð he mirc ðat ear was ligt, And euerilc on ðat helden wid him, ðo wurðen mirc, and swart, and dim, And fellen ut of heuones ligt, In to ðis middil walknes nigt; And get ne kuðe he nogt blinne for to don an oðer sinne. Esten he sag in paradis Adam and eue in mike[l] pris, Newelike he was of erðe wrogt, And to ðat mirie blisse brogt; ðowgte ðis quead, “hu ma it ben, Adam ben king and eue quuen Of alle ðe ðinge [ðe] in werlde ben. Hu mai it hauen, hu mai it sen, Of fis, of fugel, of wrim, of der, Of alle ðhinge ðe wunen her, Euerilc ðhing haued he geue name, Me to sorge, scaðe, and same; for adam sul ðus, and his wif, In blisse ðus leden lesteful lif; for alle ðo, ðe of hem sule cumen, sulen ermor in blisse wunen, And we ðe ben fro heuene driuen, sulen ðusse one in sorwe liuen; Get ic wene I can a red, ðat hem sal bringen iwel sped; for gef he don ðad god for-bead, ðat sal hem bringen to ðo dead, And sal get ðis ilke dai, ðor buten hunte if ic mai; Ic wene ðat ic, and eue hise wif, sulen adam bilirten of hise lif. Ic wene ðat ic and eue sulen alle is blisse dreue.” Ðus he ðhogte, and up he steg, And esten til dat erð he teg, Wente in to a wirme, and tolde eue a tale; And senkede hire hure aldre bale. “Eue,” seide he, ðat neddre bold, “Quat oget nu ðat for-bode o-wold, ðat a tre gu forboden is, ðat ouer alle oðre bered pris? for is fruit sired mannes mood, To witen boðen iwel and good, Sone ge it ðor-of hauen eten, Al ge it sulen witent and nogt forgeten, And ben so wise alle euene So ðo ðe wunen a-buuen in heuone.” Ðanne ðogte eue on hire mod, ðanne is tis fruit wel swiðe good, fair on sigðhe and softe on hond, Of ðis fruit wile ic hauen fond. Sum ghe ðer at, and sum ghe nam, And bar it to her fere adam; So manie times ghe him scroðt, Queðer so him was lef or loðt, for to forðen is fendes wil, At he dat fruit, and dede unskil; Sone it was under brest numen; Dedes two bondes on hem ben comen; Vn-buxumhed he hauen hem don, Vn-buxumhed is hem cumen on; Vn-welde woren and in win, Here owen limes hem wið-in. flesses fremeðe and safte same boðen he felten on here lichame; ðo gunen he same sriden, And limes in leues hiden. Nu wot adam sum-del o wo, Her-after sal he leren mo. After ðis dede a steuone cam, “ðu, nu, quor art, adam, adam?” “Louerd, quat same is me bi-tid, for ic am naked and haue me hid?” “Quo seide ðe dat gu wer naked; ðu haues ðe sorges sigðhe waked, for ðhu min bode-word haues broken, ðhu salt ben ut in sorge luken, In swinc ðu salt tilen ði mete[n], ðin bred wid swotes teres eten, Til gu beas eft in to erðe cumen, Quer-of gu beas to manne numen; And wif sal under were wunen, In heuerilc birðhe sorge numen; And niðful neddre, loð an liðer, sal gliden on hise brest neðer, And erðe freten wile he mai liuen, And atter on is tunge cliuen; And nið, and strif, and ate, and san, Sal ben bi-twen neddre and wimman; And get sal wimman ouercumen, His heued under fote bi-numen.” Two pilches weren ðurg engeles wrogt, And to adam and to eue brogt, ðor-wið he ben nu boðen srid, And here same sumdel is hid.

Babel, ðat tur, bi-lef un-mad, ðat folc is wide on lon[de] sad; Nembrot nam wið strengðhe ðat lond, And helde ðe tur o babel in his hond. Belus king was nembrot sune, Nilus his sune gan ille wune; Belus wurð dead, and nilus king Made likenesse, for muni[n]g, After his fader, and he so dede, He it setten on an mirie stede; Euerilc man he gaf lif and frið ðat to ðat likenesse sogte grið; for ðat frið ðat [gaf] hem ðe king, He boren ðat liknesse wurðing, Calden it bel, after belum; After ðis cam swilc oðer sum, Manie man, is frend for to munen, Made liknesse after ðe wunen, Bel was ðe firste, and after him Sum higte beland, sum balim, And sum bel, and sum bal; fendes fleiðing wex wið-al, To wenden men fro godes reed, To newe luue and to newe dred; Ydolatrie ðus was boren, for quuam mani man is for-loren. Of sem, and of ðe folc ðe of him cam, luue and dred under gode nam; Of ðis kinge wil we leden song, Cristes helpe be us amonge! Noe, sem, arfaxath, sale, Heber, phaleth, ðe sexte is he, Reu, saruch, nachor, thare, ðis is ðe tende fro noe. Ðis oðer werldes elde is so, A ðhusent ger seuenti and two. ðe ðridde werldes elde cam, Quanne thare bi-gat abram; for he bi-gat a sune aram, Nachor midlest, last abram; Aram bi-gat loth, and sarray, And melcham, and was sort leui. In lond caldea, hur hicte ðe tun, Quor deades strenge warp him dun; ðor fader, and breðere, and childre, and wif, Him bi-stoden wið sorwes strif; ðo ðogte thare on his mod, long bigging is here nogt god.

Thare let hur, and ðeðen he nam, And wulde to lond canahan, Cam into a burgt ðat het aram, In londe mesopothaniam. Wið him ledde he nachor, melcam, Sarray, loth, and abram. Tho hundred ger and fifue mo, Thare was old, starf he ðo. Teres gliden for hertes sor fro loth, and abram, and nachor; Thare lið biried in aram. God seide wurd to abram:— “Abram, ðu fare ut of lond and kin To a lond ic ðe sal bringen hin.” Sex ger and fiftene mo, Adde Abram on is elde ðo. Abram tok loth wið sarray, Hise agte, and erue he ledde him bi, For in to lond cananeam, And in-to sichem, a burgt, he nam, And ðeðen he nam to mirie dale; fif burges wer ðor-inne bi tale, ðer-fore it higte pentapolis, Of weledes fulsum and of blis, Nov ist a water of loðlic ble, Men callið it ðe dede se; Ilc ðing deieð ðor-inne is driuen; Ne may no fis ðor-inne liuen; for mannes sinne ðus it is went, brent wið brimfir, sunken and shent. God quad to abram, “al ðis lond sal cumen in to is kinnes hond.” ðor god him taunede, made habram An alter, and fro ðeðen he nam. An oðer alter abram seli Made bi-twen betel and ai. At damaske is ðe ðridde stede, Quer abram is bigging dede, And ðeden for he, for hunger bond, feger ut in to egipte lond; ðor he seide ðat sarrai was his sister, al for-ði for he dredde him to leten is lif If he wisten ghe wore is wif; for ghe was fair witter-like, And ðat folc luuede lecherlike. Quan abram was to egipte cumen, Sone him was sarrai binumen; Sone him was sarray bi-lagt, And pharaon ðe kinge bi-tagt; God sente on him sekenesse &amp; care, And lettede al his lecher-fare. Sarray liuede in clene lif, And ðe king ðholede sorges strif Til he wiste al ðat strif Cam him on for abram wif; ðo sente he after abram, And bi-tagte he him is leman, And gaf him lond, and agte, and fe, And leue, ðor quiles his wille be, To wune egipte folc among, And friðen him wel fro euerilc wrong, Bad him to god his erdne beren, ðat ywel him sulde nunmor deren. ðor wunede abram in welðe and in frið, Egipte clerkes woren him wið, And hem lerede, witterlike, Astronomige and arsmétike; He was hem lef, he woren him hold. God gaf him ðor siluer and gold, And hird, and orf, and srud, and sat, Vn-achteled welðe he ðor bi-gat. Vt of egipte, riche man, Wente abram in to lond canaan; And loth hise neue and sarray bileften bi-twen betel and ay, ðor he quilum her wisten wunen, Or he weren to egipte cumen. So wex here erue, and so gan ðen An twen here hirdes striuing gan ben; Loth him ches, bi leue of abram, ðat herðe hende ðe flum iurdan; In mirie dale hise bigginge he ches, ðat he siðen twie for-les. Abram let loth in welðe and wale, And ferde a-wei to mambre dale; ðor wunede abram henden ebron, ðat burge an oðer man lið on, It atteð cariatharbe, On engle speche fowre cite; fowre arbe cariatht arn in, for ðat fowre biried ðor ben; ðor was leid adam and eua, Abram siðen and sarra; ðor ysaac and rebecca, And iacob and hise wif lia.

Abraham rapede him sone in sped for to fulfillen godes reed; He flemede agar and ysmael In sumertid, In egest sel; Bred, and a fetles wið water fild, Bar agar wið hire and wið ðe child; Bi ðe desert a-wei che nam, In ard weie and hete gram; Wið swinc and hete hem wexon ðrist, ðe water sleckede ðe childes list; Tid-like hem gan ðat water laken, ðo gan agares sorwe waken; Wantede ðit child faiernesse and migt, His moder wurð neg dead for frigt.

To lond moab drugen he so, ðor nu is a burg, ierico. Balaac king was for-dred for-ðan, And sente in to lond madian, To hise frend ðe ben him nest; And sente after balaam ðe prest, Wið riche men an giftes oc, for to stillen hise [vn-]eðe mod, And bad him cumen for to don fol[c] of ysrael his cursing on. Balaam wið-eld him ðor ðat nagt To witen quat him sal wurðen tagt; Al was is fultum and his sped Bi-luken ille, in fendes red. On nigt him cam sonde fro gode, Agen ðis ginges red for-bode, And ðat he ne curse non del ðis folc ðat god bliscede wel. O morgen seide he, “fare ic nogt, for bode is me fro gode brogt.” Balaac sente richere an mo Medes, and oðer men to ðo. “Sondes, sondes,” quað balaam, Or he ðese oðere medes nam, “Dog balaac king me goue hold, His hus ful of siluer and of gold, Ne mai ic wenden her bi-neðen;” Godes wurd is cumen als it is queðen; Oc or or ge wenden agen, ðis nigt ic sal fonden and sen Quat tiding so it cam on ðe nigt.” On morgen, at ðe daiges ligt, Vp-on hise asse his sadel he dede, To madian lond wente he his ride, And wente is herte on werre ðhogt; Wicke giscing it haued al wrogt. ðus rideð forð ðis man for-loren, An angel drog an swerd him bi-foren, ðis asse wurð so sore of dred, Vt of ðe weige it haueð him led. Sellic ðogte balaam for-ði, And bet and wente it to ðe sti Bi-twen two walles of ston; Eft stod ðis angel him a-gon, ðis asse is eft of weige stired, So ðat balames fot is hird; And he wurð ðo for anger wroð, And ðis prikeð and negt sloð; forð and narwere ðis asse him bar, And ðe ðridde siðe wurð ðe angel war. ðo ne migte ðes asse flen, Ne he ne durste forðere ten, Oc fel ðor dun(.) ðan ðis was don, Balaam it spureð and smit ðor-on; And god vndede ðis asses muð, So soð it is(.) so it is selcuð. Quuað ðis asse ðus wið vn-miðe, “Qui betes ðu me ðis ðridde siðe?” Quað balaam, “for ðu tregest me; Had ic an swerd, ic sluge ðe.” So was ðis were to wunder brogt, ðhog ðe asse spac, frigtede he nogt; ðo let goð him ðat angel sen, wið ðe swerd dragen him agen. Quað ðe angel, “ðin weige is me loð, ðor-fore am ic wið ðe ðus loð; If ðin asse ne were wið-ðragen, Her suldes ðu nu wurðen slagen.” Quað balaam, “quane ic haue mis-faren, If ðu wilt, ic agen sal charen.” “far forð,” quað ðe angel, “oc loc ðe wel, for-bi min red, quað ðu non del.” forð-nam balaam, and balaac king Cam him a-gen for wurðing, Gaf him giftes of mikil pris; And balaam seide him to wis, “Sal ic non wurð mugen forð-don, Vten ðat god me leið on.” Balaac him leddede heg on an hil, And .vii. alteres wrogte in his wil, On ilc alter fier alðerneðer, And ðor-on an calf and a weðer, And he bad balaac stonden ðor-bi, And gede on-rum qui bute for-ði. fro abuuen cam to him bi-neðen, Word in herte dat he sal queðen; Quan he cam to balaac a-gen, Swilc wurdes he let vt-ten. “Hu mai ic ðat folc cursen on, ðor louerd haued bliscing don? ðis folk sal waxen wel and ðen, And ouer al oðer migtful ben, His lif beð bliðe, his ending sal, ðe timeð al-so ðis timen sal.” Balaac misliked al ðis queðe, And ledde hem ðeðen on oðer stede, To munt faga, for to sen wel Of folc israel ðe oðer del.

Vten iosue and caleph, Alle elles he driuen in deades weph; Alle ðise wapmen dor god let liwen, ðe lond hoten sal hem ben giuen. God moyses clepede and quad to him, “stig hege up to munt Abarim, And ic sal don ðe ðeden sen ðe lond ðe sal ðis folc[e]s ben; ðer ðu salt ben of werlde numen. In to ðat lond salt ðu nogt cumen.” “Louerd, merci!” quad moyses, Let ðu ðin folc nogt helpe-les, And good let oc ðu hem bi-se, Alswilc als hem bi-hu[f]lik bee.” God hem andswerede, “iosue Ic wile ben loder-man after ðe; Tac him bi-foren eleazar, ðat al ðin folc wurð war, And ðine hondes ley him on, Sey him on ðin stede to gon.” Als it is boden, also he dede, Iosue wurð set on hise stede.
