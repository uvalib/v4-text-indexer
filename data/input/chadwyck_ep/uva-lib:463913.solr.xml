      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST NOBLE COMBINER OF LEARNING, AND HONOVR: S?. Francis Bacon, Knight; Lord High Chancelor of England, &amp;c. To my worthy friend M?. George Chapman, and his translated Hesiod. Chapman; We finde by thy past-prized fraught, What wealth thou dost vpon this Land conferre; Th'olde Græcian Prophets hither that hast brought, Of their full words the true Interpreter: And by thy trauell, strongly hast exprest The large dimensions of the English tongue; Deliuering them so well, the first and best, That to the world in Numbers euer sung. Thou hast vnlock'd the treasury, wherein All Art, and knowledge haue so long been hidden: Which, till the gracefull Muses did begin Here to inhabite, was to vs forbidden. In blest Elizium, (in a place most fit) Vnder that tree due to the Delphian God, Musæus, and that Iliad Singer sit, And neare to them that noble Hesiod, Smoothing their rugged foreheads; and do smile, After so many hundred yeares to see Their Poems read in this farre westerne Ile, Translated from their ancient Greeke, by thee; Each his good Genius whispering in his eare, That with so lucky, and auspicious fate Did still attend them, whilst they liuing were, And gaue their Verses such a lasting date. Where slightly passing by the Thespian spring, Many long after did but onely sup; Nature, then fruitfull, forth these men did bring, To fetch deepe Rowses from Ioues plentious cup. In thy free Labours (friend) then rest context. Feare not Detraction, neither fawne on Praise: When idle Censure all her force hath spent, Knowledge can crowne her self with her owne Baies. Their Lines, that haue so many liues outworne, Cleerely expounded shall base Enuy scorne. Michael Drayton. To my worthy and honour'd Friend, M? George Chapman, on his Translation of Hesiods Works, &amp; Dayes. Whose worke could this be, Chapman, to refine Olde Hesiods Ore, and giue it vs; but thine, Who hadst before wrought in rich Homers Mine? What treasure hast thou brought vs! and what store Still, still, dost thou arriue with, at our shore, To make thy honour, and our wealth the more! If all the vulgar Tongues that speake this day, Were askt of thy Discoueries; They must say, To the Greeke coast thine onely knew the way. Such Passage hast thou found, such Returnes made, As, now of all men, it is call'd thy Trade: And who make thither else, rob, or inuade. Ben: Ionson. THE GEORGICKS, OF HESIOD. By George Chapman. The First Booke. Mvses! That out of your Pierean state, All worth, in sacred Numbers celebrate; Vse here your faculties so much renownd, To sing your sire; And him in hymns reso?d; By whom, All humanes, that to death are bo?d, Are bound together: Both the Great in fame; And Men, whose Poore Fates fitt them, with no Name; Noble, and Base; Great Ioues will, orders All; For He with ease extolls; with ease, lets fall; Easely diminisheth the most in grace, And lifts the most obscure to loftiest place: Easely sets straight the quite shrunke vp together; And makes the mostelated Beautie, wither: And this is Ioue, that breakes his voice so hie, In horrid sounds; nd dwels aboue the skie: Heare then, O Ioue, that dost both see and heare; And, for thy Iustice sake, Be Orderer, To these iust Præcepts; that in Prophecy; I vse; to teach my Brother Pietie: Not one contention, on the Earth there Raignes, To raise Mens fortunes, and peculiar gaines; But Two. The One; the knowing Man approues: The Other, Hate shòuld force from humane loues; Since it derides our reasonable kinde; In two parts, parting, Mans vnited Minde; And is so harmefull: for pernicious Warre, It feedes; and bites, at euery Ciuile Iarre: Which no man loues; But strong Necessitie, Doth this Contention, as his plague implie, By Heauens hid Counsailes. Th'other strife, Black Night, Begat before: which Ioue, that in the light Of all the starres dwels; And though Thron'd aloft; Of each Man, weighs yet, both the worke, and thought; Put in the Roots of Earth; from whose wombe, growe Mens needfull Meanes, to pay the debt they owe To Life, and liuing: And this strife is far, More fit for Men; And much the sprightlier: For He, in whose hands, liues no loue of Art, Nor vertuous Industry; yet plucks vp heart, And falls to worke for liuing. Any One, Neuer so stupid, and so base a Drone; Seeing a Rich Man haste, to sowe, and plant, And guide his House well; feeles, with shame, his want, And labours like him: And this strife is good. When strife for riches, warmes, and fires the bloud; The Neighbour, doth the Neighbour, æmulate: The Potter, doth the Potters profit hate; The Smith, the Smith, with spleene inueterate: Begger, maligns the Begger, for good done; And the Musition, the Musition. This strife, O Perses, see remembred still: But flie Contention, that insults on th'ill Of other Men; And from thy worke doth drawe, To be a well-seene Man, in works of Lawe. Nor to those Courts, afford affected eare: For he that hath not, for the entire yeare, Enough laid vp before hand; little need, Hath to take Care, those factious Courts to feed, With what Earth beares; And Ceres doth bestowe; With which, when thou art satiate; Nor dost know, What to do with it: Then, to those wars go, For others Goods: But see no more spent so Of thine hereafter. Let our selues decide, With Doomes direct; All diff'rences implide, In our Affaires; And what is ratifide, By Ioues will, to be ours; Account our owne; For that thriues euer best. Our discord growne; For what did from our Fathers Bounty fall, We ended lately; And shar'd freely All. When Thou much more than thine hadst rauisht home; With which, thou mad'st proud, and didst ouercome With partiall affection to thy Cause; Those gift-deuouring kings, that sway our lawes. Who would haue still retaind vs in their powers; And giuen by their Doomes; what was freely ours. O Fooles, that all things into Iudgement call; Yet know not how much Halfe is more than All. Nor how the Meane life, is the firmest still. Nor of the Mallow, and the Daffodill, How great a Good the little Meales containe. But God hath hid from Men the healthfull Meane; For otherwise, A Man might heap (and play) Enough to serue the whole yeare, in a Day; And strait, his Draught-Tree hang vp in the smoke, Nor more, his labouring Mules, nor Oxen yoke. But Ioue; Mans knowledge of his Best, bereau'd; Conceiuing Anger, since he was deceau'd, By that same wisdome-wresting, Iaphets sonne; For which, All ill All earth did ouer-run. For Ioue, close keeping in a hollow Cane, His holy fire: To serue the vse of Man, Prometheus stole it, by his humane sleight From him that hath of all heauens wit, the height. For which, He angrie; Thus to him began The Cloud-Assembler: Thou most crafty Man, That ioy'st to steale my fire, deceiuing Me; Shalt feele that Ioy, the greater griefe to thee; And therein plague thy vniuersall Race: To whom, Ile giue a pleasing ill, in place Of that good fire: And all shall be so vaine, To place their pleasure in embracing paine. Thus spake, and laught, of Gods and Men the sire: And straight enioynd the famous God of Fire, To mingle instantly, with Water, Earth; The voyce, and vigor, of a humane Birth, Imposing in it; And so faire a face, As matcht th'Immortall Goddesses, in grace. Her forme presenting a most louely Maid; Then on Minerua, his Command he laid, To make her worke, and wield the wittie loome: And (for her Beauty) such as might become The Golden Uenus; He commanded Her, Vpon her Browes, and Countenance to conferre Her owne Bewitchings; stuffing all her Breast, With wilde Desires, incapable of Rest; And Cares, that feed to all satiety, All humane Lineaments. The Crafty spy, And Messenger-of Godheads, Mercury, He charg'd t'informe her, with a dogged Minde, And theeuish Manners. All as he design'd, Was put in act. A Creature straight had frame, Like to a Virgine; Milde and full of shame; Which Ioues suggestion, made the both-foot lame, Forme so deceitfully; And all of Earth, To forge the liuing Matter of her Birth. Gray-eyd Minerua, Put her Girdle on; And show'd how loose parts, wel-composed, shone The deified Graces; And the Dame that sets Sweet words, in chiefe forme; Golden Carquenets, Embrac't her Neck withall; The faire-haird Howers, Her gracious Temples crownd, with fresh-spring flowers; But, of all these, imployd in seuerall place; Pallas gaue Order, the impulsiue grace. Her bosome, Hermes, the great God of spies, With subtle fashions fill'd, faire words and lies; Ioue prompting still. But all the voyce she vs'd, The vocall Herald of the Gods infus'd; And call'd her Name, Pandora; since on Her, The Gods did all their seuerall gifts confer: Who made her such, in euery moouing straine, To be the Bane of curious Minded Men. Her harmefull, and ineuitable Frame, At all parts perfect; Ioue dismist the Dame To Epimetheus, In his Heralds guide; With all the Gods plagues, in a Box, beside. Nor Epimetheus, kept one word in store Of what Prometheus, had aduis'd before; Which was; That Ioue should fasten on his hand, No gift at all; But he, his wile withstand, And back returne it; Lest with instant ill, To mortall Men; He all the world did fill. But he first tooke the gift; and after grieu'd. For first, the Families of Mortals, liu'd Without, and free from Ill; Harsh Labour, then, Nor sicknesse, hasting timelesse Age on Men; Their hard, and wretched Tasks impos'd on them, For many yeares; But now, a violent stream, Of all Afflictions; In an instant came, And quencht Lifes light; that shin'd before in flame. For when the women; The vnwieldy lid, Had once discouerd: All the miseries hid, In that curst Cabinet; dispèrst, and flew About the world; Ioyes pin'd; And Sorrowes grew. Hope onely rested, in the Boxes Brim; And tooke not wing from thence: Ioue prompted him, That ow'd the Cabinet; to clap it close, Before she parted; But vnnumbred woes, Besides, encountred Men, in all their waies. Full were all shores of them; And full all seas. Diseases; Day, and Night; with naturall wings, And silent Entries stole on men their stings; The great in counsailes, Ioue, Their voyces reft; That not the truest, might auoide their Theft; Nor any scape the Ill, in any kinde, Resolu'd at first, in his almighty Minde. And, wert thou willing; I would adde to this, A second Cause of mens calamities: Sing all before; And since; Nor will be long, But short, and knowing; And t'obserue my song, By thy conceit, And Mind's retention strong. When first, Both Gods, and Men, had one Times Birth; The Gods, of diuerse languag'd Men, on Earth; A golden world produc't; That did sustaine, Old Saturnes Rule; when He in heauen did raigne; And then liu'd Men, like Gods, in pleasure here; Indu'd with Mindes secure; from Toyles, Griefs, cleer; Nor noysom Age, made any crooked, There. Their feet went euer naked as their hands; Their Cates were blessed, seruing their Commands, With ceaselesse Plenties; All Daies, sacred made To Feasts, that surfets neuer could inuade. Thus liu'd they long; and died, as seisd with sleep; All Good things seru'd them; Fruits did euer keep, Their free fields crownd; That all abundance bore; All which; All, equall, shar'd; And none wisht more. And when the Earth had hid them; Ioues will was, The Good should into heauenly Natures passe; Yet still held state, on Earth; And Guardians were, Of all best Mortals, still suruiuing there; Obseru'd works iust, and vniust; clad in Aire; And gliding vndiscouerd, euery where; Gaue Riches where they pleas'd; And so were reft, Nothing, of All the Royall Rule they left. The second Age; That next succeeded This; Was farre the worse; which Heauen-hous'd Deities, Of Siluer, fashiond; Not like that of Gould, In disposition; Nor so wisely Soul'd. For Children then liu'd, in their mothers Cares, (All that time growing still) A Hundred yeares: And were such great fooles, at that Age; That They, Could not, themselues, dispose a Family. And when they Youths grew; hauing reacht the Date, That rear'd their forces vp, to Mans estate; They liu'd small space; And spent it all in paine; Caus'd by their follies: Not of powre t'abstaine, From doing one another Iniurie. Nor would They worship any Deity; Nor on the holy Altars of the Blest, Any appropriate sacrifice addrest, As fits the fashion of all humane Birth. For which, Ioue angry; hid them straight in Earth; Since to the blessed Deities of Heauen, They gaue not those Respects, They should haue giuen. But when the Earth had hid these, like the rest; They then were calld, the subterrestriall blest; And in Blisse second; hauing honours then; Fit, for th'Infernall spirits, of powrefull Men. Then formd, our Father Ioue, a third Descent; Whose Age was brazen; clearely different From that of Siluer. All the Mortalls there, Of wilde Ashe fashiond; stubborne and austere; Whose Mindes, the harmefull facts of Mars affected; And Petulant Iniurie. All Meates reiected, Of Naturall fruits, and Hearbs. And these were They, That first began, that Table Cruelty, Of slaughtering Beasts; And therefore grew they fierce; And not to be indur'd, in their Commerce. Their ruthlesse Mindes, in Adamant were cut; Their strengths were dismall; And their shoulders put, Inaccessible hands out; ouer all Their brawny limbs, armd with a brazen wall. Their Houses all were brazen; All of Brasse, Their working Instruments; for blacke Iron was As yet vnknowne: And, these (their owne liues ending; The vast, and cold-sad house of hell-descending) No grace had in their ends: But though they were Neuer so powrefull; and enforcing feare; Blacke Death, reduc't their Greatnes in their spight, T'a little Roome; And stopt their chearefull light. When these left life; A fourth kinde, Ioue gaue birth; Vpon the many-a-creature, nourishing Earth; More iust, and better than this Race before; Diuine Herwes; That the surnames bore, Of Semigods; yet These; Impetuous Fight, And bloody War, bereft of life, and light. Some, in Cadmæan Earth; contentious; To prise the infinite wealth of Oedipus; Before seauen-ported Theb's; some shipt vpon, The ruthles waues; and led to Ilion, For faire-hair'd Hellens loue; where, likewise They; In bounds of Death; confind the beames of Daie. To these yet; Ioue gaue second life, and seat, At ends, of all the Earth; In a Retreate, From humane feete; where soules secure they beare Amids the blessed Ilands; situate nere, The gulfie-whirle-pit-eating Ocean floud. Happy Herwes liuing; For whose food, The plentie-bearing Tellus; thrice a yeare, Delicious fruits, and fragrant Hearbes doth beare. O that, I might not liue now; To partake, The Age, that must, the fist succession make; But either Dy before; Or else were borne, When all that Age, is into ashes worne. For, that which next springs, in supply of this, Will all of Iron, produce his families; Whose bloods, shall be so banefully Corrupt, They shall not let them sleepe; But interrupt, With Toiles, and Miseries, All their Rests, And fares. The Gods, such graue, and soule-dissecting cares, Shall steepe their Bosomes in; And yet, some Good, Will God mixe with their bad; for when the blood, Faints in their nourishment; And leaues their haire, A little gray; Ioues hand, will stop the Aire, Twixt them, and life; And take them straight away. Twixt Men, and women, shall be such foule play, In their begetting pleasures; And their Race, Spring from such false seed; That the sonnes stolne face; Shall nought be like the sires; The sire, no more, Seene in his Issue. No friend as before Shall like his friend be: Nor no Brother, rest Kinde, like his Brother: No Guest, like a Guest Of former times; No Childe, vse like a Childe, His aged Parents; But with manners wilde, Reuile, and shame them; Their Impietie, Shall neuer feare, that Gods all-seeing eye. Is fixt vpon them; But shall quite despise, Repaiment of their educations prise; Beare their law, in their hands; And when they get, Their fathers free-giuen goods; Account them debt. Citie shall Citie ransack; Not a Grace, To any pious Man shall shew her face; Nor to a iust, or good Man. All, much more, Shall grace a Beastly, and iniurious Bore; No Right shall seise on any hand of theirs; Nor any shame make blush, their black affaires; The worse shall worse the better, with bad words; And sweare him out, of all his Right affords. Ill-lung'd; Ill-liuerd, Ill-complexion'd Spight, Shall consort all the Miserable plight, Of Men then liuing. Iustice then, and Shame, Clad in pure white (as if they neuer came, In touch of those societies) shall flie, Vp to the Gods Immortall familie, From broad-way'd Earth: And leave graue griefs to Men; That (desp'rate of Amends) must beare all Then. But now to Kings, A Fable Ile obtrude, Though cleere, they sauor all it can include. The Hauke once, hauing trust vp in his Seres, The sweet-tun'd Nightingale; and to the Spheres, His prey transferring: with his Tallons, she Pincht too extreamely; and incessantly, Crying, for Anguish; This imperious speech, He gaue the poore Bird; Why complainst thou wretch? One holdes thee now, that is thy Mightier far; Goe, as he guides; Though ne're so singular Thou art a Singer; It lies now in me. To make thee sup me; Or to set thee free. Foole that thou art; who euer will contend, With one, whose faculties, his owne transcend; Both failes of Conquest; And is likewise sure, Besides his wrong, He shall bad words endure. Thus spake the swift, and broad-wing'd Bird of Prey; But heare thou Iustice; And hate Iniury. Wrong touches neer a miserable Man; For (though most patient) yet he hardly can Forbeare iust words; and feele iniurious deeds; Vniust loads, vex; He hardly beares that bleeds. And yet hath Wrong, to Right; a better way: For, in the end, will Iustice winne the Day. Till which, who beares, sees then, Amends arise: The foole first suffers, and is after wise. But crooked Iustice; ioyntly hookes with it, Iniurious Periury; And that vnfit Outrage, brib'd Iudges vse; that makes them drawe, The way their gifts goe; euer cuts out Lawe, By crooked Measures. Equall iustice then, All clad in Aire; th'ill Mindes of bribed Men, Comes after mourning: Mourns the Cities ill; Which where she is expell'd, shee brings in still. But those that with impartiall Doomes extend, As well to strangers, as their houshould friend The Law's pure Truth; And will in no point stray, From forth the straight Tract, of the equall way: With such, the Citie; all things Noble nourish: With such, the People, in their Profits flourish. Sweet Peace, along the Land goes; Nor to them All seeing loue, will destinate th'extreame Of banefull Warre. No Hunger euer comes; No ill, where Iudges vse impartiall Doomes. But Goods well got maintaine still neighbour feasts; The Fields flowe there, with lawfull Interests. On Hils, the high Oke, Acorns beares; In Dales, Th'industrious Bee her Hony sweet exhales: And ful-feld Sheep, are shorne with Festiuales; There, women bring forth children like their Sire; And all, in all kindes, finde their owne entire. Nor euer plow they vp the barren Seas, Their owne fat Fields yeeld store enough to please. But whom rude Iniurie delights, and Acts That Misery, and Tyranny contracts; Sharp-sighted Ioue, for such predestines paine; And oftentimes; The whole Land doth sustain For one Mans wickednes; that thriuing in Inequall Doomes; still makes his sentence him. For where such Men beare priuileg'd office still; There Ioue poures downe whole deluges of ill. Famine and Pestilence together goe; The people perish; women baraine growe; Whole Houses vanish there, sometimes in peace; And sometimes Armies rais'd to shield th' increase, The Gods late gaue them: euen those Gods destroy Their Rampires ruine; and let Rapine ioy The Goods Iniustice gatherd: Or, elsewhere Ioue sinks their ships, and leaues their ventures there. Weigh then your selues, this Iustice O ye Kings; For howsoeuer oft, vnequall things Obtatine their passe; they passe not so the eyes, Of all the all-discerning Deities; For close and conuersant their virtues be With Men; and how they grate each other, see, With wrested Iudgements; yeelding no cares due, To those sure wreakes, with which the Gods pursue Vnequall Iudges; Though on Earth there are, Innumerable Gods that minister, Beneath great Ioue; That keep Men clad in Aire; Corrupt Doomes noting, and each false affaire; And gliding through the Earth, are euery where; Iustice is feed to Ioue; in all fame deare, And reuerend to the Gods, inhabiting Heauen; And still a Virgin; whom when Men ill giuen, Hurt, and abhorring from the right, shall wrong; She for redresse; to Ioue her fire complaines, Of the vniust minde, euery man sustaines; And prayes the people may repay the paines Their Kings haue forfaited in their offences; Deprauing Iustice, and the genuine senses, Of lawes corrupted, in their sentences. Obseruing this, ye Gift-deuouring Kings; Correct your sentences; and to their springs, Remember euer to reduce those streames, Whose crooked courses euery Man condemnes. Whoeuer forgeth, for another, ill; With it, himselfe is ouertaken still; In ill, Men runne on that they most abhor; Ill counsell, worst is to the Councelor. For Ioues eye, all things seeing, and knowing all; Euen these things, if he will; of force must fall Within his sight, and knowledge; Nor to him, Can these brib'd Domes, in Cities shine so dim, But he discernes them; and will pay them paine: Else would not I liue iustly amongst Men; Nor to my Iustice frame my children; If to be iust, is euer to be ill; And that the vniust findes most iustice still; And Ioue gaue each Man in the end his will. But he that loues the lightning (I conceiue) To these things thus, will no conclusion giue. Howeuer Perses, put these in thy heart; And to the equity of things conuert Thy Mindes whole forces; all thought striking dead; To that foule Rapine, that hath now such heade. For in our Manhoods, Ioue hath Iustice clos'd; And as a law, vpon our soules impos'd: Fish, Foule, and sauage Beasts; whose (Law is power) Ioue lets each other mutually deuoure; Because they lack the equity he giues To gouerne Men; as, farre best for their liues; And therefore Men should follow it with striues. For he that knowes the iustice of a Cause; And will in publike Ministrie of Lawes, Giue sentence to his knowledge; Be he sure, God will enrich him. But who dares abiure His conscious knowledge; and belie the lawe; Past cure, will that wound in his Conscience drawe. And for his radiance now, his Race shall be The deeper plung'd in all obscurity. The iust mans state, shall in his seed exceed; And, after him, breed honours as they breed. But, why mens ills preuaile so much with them; I, that the Good know, will vnclowd the Beame, In whose light lies the reason; with much ease, To vice, and her loue, Men may make accesse; Such crewes in Rout, Herd to her, and her Court So passing neare lies; Their way sweet and short; But before Vertue, doe the Gods raine sweat, Through which, with Toile, and halfe-dissolued feet, You must wade to her; her path long and steep; And at your entry, tis so sharp and deep. But scaling once her height, the ioy is more, Than all the paine she put you to before. The paine at first then, both to loue and knowe Iustice and Vertue; and those few that goe Their rugged way; is cause tis followed lest. Of all Men therefore, he is alwaies best, That not depending on the mightiest, Nor on the most; hath of him selfe descried, All things becomming; and goes fortified, In his owne knowledge, so farre, as t'intend What now is best; and will be best at th'end. Yet hee is good too, and enough doth know, That onely followes, being admonisht how: But hee that neither of himselfe can tell, What fits a man; nor being admonisht well, Will giue his minde to learne; But flat refuse; That man, cast out from euery humane vse. Doe thou then, euer in thy Memory place My precepts Perses, sprung of sacred Race; And worke out what thou knowst not: that with hate Famine may prosecute thy full estate; And rich-wreath'd Ceres (reuerenc't of all,) Loue thee as much; and make her festiuall, Amids thy Granaries: Famine euermore Is naturall consort of the idle Boore. Whoeuer idly liues, both Gods, and Men Pursue with hatefull and still-punishing spleene. The slothfull man is like the sting-lesse Drone, That all his powre, and disposition, Emploies to rob the labours of the Bee; And with his sloth, deuoure her Industrie. Doe thou repose thy speciall pleasure then, In still being conuersant, with temperate paine; That to thee still, the Seasons may send home Their vtmost store. With Labour Men become Herd-full, and rich; with labour thou shalt proue Great, both in humane, and the Deities loue. One, with another, all combin'd in one, Hate with infernall horror, th'idle Drone. Labour and thriue; and th'idle 'twill inflame. No shame to labor; sloth is yok't with shame. Glorie and vertue into consort fall With wealth; wealth God-like winnes the grace of all. Since which; yet, springs out of the root of paine; Paine hath præcedence; so thou dost maintaine The temper fitting; and that foolish vaine Of striuing for the wealth of other Men, Thou giu'st no vent; but on thine owne affaires Conuert'st thy Minde; and thereon laiest thy cares. And then put on, with all the spirit, you can. Shame is not good in any needy Man. Shame much obscures, and makes as much to fame. Wealth loues Audacity; Want fauours Shame. Riches, not rauisht, but diuinely sent For virtuous labour, are most permanent. If any stand on force, and get wealth so; Or with the tongue, spoile, as a number doe; When Gaine, or Craft doth ouergoe the soule; And Impudence doth honest shame contoule; God easely can the so-made-great disgrace; And his House, raisd so, can as easely race. Riches beare Date, but of a little space. Who wrongs an humble suppliant, doth offend, As much as he, that wrongs a Guest, or friend. Who, for his brothers wifes loue, doth ascend His brothers bed; and hath his vicious end; Offends no more than he, that doth deceiue An Orphane, of the goods his Parents leaue; Or he that in the wretched bounds of Age, Reuiles his Father. All these Ioue enrage; And shall receiue of Him reuenge at last, Inflicting all paines, that till then they past. From all these therefore, turne thy striuing Minde, And to thy vtmost, see the Gods assign'd Chastly, and purely; all their holy dues. Burne fattest thighes to them; and sometimes vse Off'rings of wine. Sometimes, serue their delights, With burning incense: both, when bed-time cites; And when from bed, the sacred Morning cals. That thou maist render the Celestialls, All waies propitious: And so, none else gather, Thy fortunes strow'd; but thou reape others rather. Suffer thy foe thy table; call thy friend. In chiefe, one neere; for if Occasion send Thy householde vse of Neighbours; they vndrest Will hast to thee; where thy Allies will rest, Till they be ready. An ill Neighbour is A curse: a good one is as great a blisse. He hath a treasure, by his fortune sign'd; That hath a Neighbour of an honest minde. No losse of Oxe, or Horse, a Man shall beare; Vnlesse a wicked Neighbour dwell too neare. Iust Measure take of Neighbours, iust repay; The same receiu'd and more; If more thou may. That after, needing; thou maiest after; finde Thy wants supplier, of as free a minde. Take no ill gaine, ill gaine brings losse as ill. Aid quit with aid: good will pay with goodwill; Giue him that hath giuen; him that hath not, giue not Giuers, Men giue; Gifts to no giuers thriue not. Giuing is good: Rapine is deadly ill. Who freely giues, though much, reioyceth still; Who rauines, is so wretched, that though small His forst gift be; he grieues, as if twere all. Little to little added, if oft done, In small time makes a great possession. Who addes to what is got; needs neuer feare, That swarth-cheek't Hunger will deuoure his cheare. Nor will it hurt a Man; though something more, Than serues meere need; he laies at home in store. And, best at home: it may go lesse abroad. If cause call forth; at home prouide thy Rode, Enough for all needs, for free spirits dy, To want, being absent from their owne supplie. Which note, I charge thee. At thy purses height, And when it fights lowe; giue thy vse his freight; When in the midst thou art, then checke the blood; Frugalitie at bottome is not good. Euen with thy brother, thinke a witnesse by; When thou wouldst laugh, or conuerse liberally; Despaire hurts none, beyond Credulitie. Let neuer neate-girt Dame, that all her wealth Laies on her waste; make profit of her stealth, On thy true iudgement; nor be heard to faine With her forkt tongue; so far forth as to gaine Thy candle rent (she calls it). He that giues A woman trust, doth trust a Den of theeues. One onely son preserues a familie; As feeding it with onely fit supplie. And that house to all height his riches reares, Whose sire dies ould, and leaues a son of yeares. To many children too, God easely spares Wealth store; but still, more children the more cares. And to the house, the more accesse is made. If then, the hearty loue of wealth inuade Thy thrifty Minde; performe what followes here; And, one worke done; with others serue the yeare. The end of the First Booke. THE SECOND BOOKE OF GEORGICKS. When Atlas Birth, the Pleiades, arise; Haruest begin; Plow when they leaue the Skies. Twice tw?ty daies, &amp; nights, these hide their heads; The yeare then turning, leaue againe their Beds; And show when first to whet the Haruest steele. This likewise is the Law, the fields must feele; Both with Sea-dwellers; neare, and high, and those, Whose winding Vallies, Neptune ouerflowes: That Fenny grounds, and Marshes dwell vpon, Along the fat, and fruitfull Region. But wheresouer thou inhabit'st; ply The Fields, before fierce winters cruelty Oppresse thy paines; when thou maiest naked Plow; Naked cast in thy seed, and naked Mow; If timely thou wilt beare into thy Barne, The works of Ceres; and to that end learne, As timely to prepare thy whole encrease; Lest, in the meane time, thy Necessities Importune thee at others Doores to stand, And begge supplies to thy vnthriftie hand: As now thou com'st to me, But I, no more Will giue, or lend thee, what thou maiest restore, By equall measure; Nor will trust thee so; Labour (vaine Perses) and those labours do, That by the certaine signe of Beggerie, Demonstrated in Idle Drones, thine eye May learne the work, that equall Deitie, Imposeth, of Necessitie, on Men: Lest, with thy wife, and wanting childeren; (Thy Minde much grieu'd) Thou seek'st of Neighbours food; Thine owne meanes failing. Men grow cold in Good. Some twice, or thrice perhaps, thy Neighbour will Supply thy wants; whom if thou troubl'st still; Thou com'st off empty; and to aire dost straine A world of words; words store, make wanting Men. I charge thee therefore, see thy thoughts imploid To pay thy Debts; and how thou maist auoid, Deserued Famine; To which end, first see, Thy Wife well orderd; and thy Familie; Thy Plough-drawne Oxe; thy Maid, without her spouse, And wisely hir'd; that businesse in thy house, May first worke off; and then to Tillage come: To both which Offices; make fit at Home, Euery thing needfull; lest abroad thou send To aske another, and he will not lend; Meane time thou want'st them; Time flies fast away, Thy work vndone; which not from Day to Day, Thou shouldst deferre; the worke Deferrer, neuer Sees full his Barne; nor he that leaues worke euer, And still is gadding out. Care flying Ease, Giues Labour euer, competent encrease. He that with doubt, his needfull businesse crosses, Is euer wrastling, with his certaine Losses. When therefore of the swift-sharp-sighted Sunne, The chiefe force faints; and sweating heat is done; Autumne growne olde; and opening his last veine; And great Ioue steeping all things in his Raine; Mans body chang'd, and made more lightsome farre; For then, but small time shines the Syrian star, Aboue the heads of hard-fate-fosterd Man; Rising neare Day; and his beames Austrian, Enioy'd in Night most: when (I say) all this Followes the Season; and the Forrest is Sound, being feld; his leaues vpon the ground Before, let fall; and leauing what they crown'd: Then constantly take time to fell thy wood; Of Husbandrie, the time kept, is the blood. Cut then your three-foot Querne; whose Pestle, cut Three Cubits long; your Axeltree seuen foot. If it be eight foot, cut your Mallet thence: The Felfs, that make your Carts circumference, Cut three spans long. Many crookt peeces more, Ten Palmes in length; fell for your Wagons store. All which poore Rules, a rich conuenience yeeld. If thou shalt finde a Culter in the Field, Or on the Mountaine: either Elme, or Oke; Conuay it home; since for thy Beasts of yoke, To plow withall, twill most his strength maintaine; And chiefly, If Athenian Ceres swaine, It fixing to the Draught-tree (lest it failes) Shall fit it, to the handles staie, with Nailes. Two Ploughs compose, to finde thee worke at home; One with a Shar; that of it selfe doth come From forth the Ploughs whole Peece; and one set on: Since so tis better much; for, either gon; With th' other, thou maist instantly impose Worke on thy Oxen. On the Lawrell growes, And on the Elme. your best Plow-handles euer. Of Oke, your Draught-tree: From the Maple, neuer Goe for your Culter: For your Oxen chuse Two males, of nine yeares olde; for then, their vse Is most auaileable; since their strengths are then, Not of the weakest; and the youthfull Meane, Stickes in their Neru's still: Nor will these contend With skittish tricks, when they their stitch should end, To breake their plough, and leaue their worke vndon; These, let a youth of forty waite vpon; Whose bread at Meales, in foure good shiuers cut; Eight bits in euery shiue; for that Man, put To his fit taske; will see it done past talke, With any fellowe; Nor will euer Balke In any stitch he makes; but giue his Minde, Whith care t' his labour. And this Man, no Hinde, (Though much his younger) shall his better be, At sowing Seed; and shunning skilfullie, Need to go ouer his whole worke againe. Your younger Man, feeds still a flying vaine, From his set taske; to holde his equalls chat; And trifles workes, he should be serious at. Take notice then, when thou the Crane shalt heare Aloft, out of the Clowds her changes reare; That then he giues thee signall when to sowe, And winters wrathfull Season doth foreshowe. And then the Man, that can no Oxen get; Or wants the Seasons worke; his heart doth eat. Then feed thy Oxen, in the house with Hay; Which he that wants; with ease enough will say, Let me, alike, thy Waine and Oxen vse: Which tis as easie for thee to refuse; And say, thy Oxeworke then importunes much. He that is rich in Braine, will answer such; Worke vp thy selfe, a Waggon of thine owne; For to the foolish borrower, is not knowne, That each Waine askes a hundred ioynts of wood; These things aske forecast; and thou shouldest make good At home, before thy need so instant stood. When therefore, first, fit plow time doth disclose; Put on with spirit; All, as one, dispose Thy seruants, and thy selfe: plow wet and drie; And when Aurora first affords her eye, In Spring-time turne the earth vp; which see done, Againe, past all faile, by the Summers Sunne. Hasten thy labours, that thy crowned fields, May load themselues to thee; and rack their yeelds. The Tilth-field sowe, on Earths most light foundations; The Tilth-field, banisher of execrations; Pleaser of Sonnes, and Daughters: which t' improue, With all wisht profits; pray to earthly Ioue, And vertuous Ceres; that on all such suits, Her sacred gift bestowes, in blessing fruits. When first thou enterst foot to plow thy land, And on thy plow-staffes top hast laid thy hand; Thy Oxens backs, that next thee, by a Chaine Thy Oken-draught Tree drawe; put to the paine Thy Goad imposes. And thy Boy behinde, That with his Iron Rake thou hast design'd, To hide thy seed; Let from his labour driue, The Birds, that offer on thy sweat to liue. The best thing, that in humane Needs doth fall, Is Industry; and Sloath the worst of all. With one, thy Corne eares, shall with fruit abound; And bow their thankfull forheads to the ground; With th' other; scarce thy seed againe redound. When Ioue then giues this good end to thy paine; Amids the Vessels that preserue thy Graine, No Spiders then, shall need t'vsurp their roome, But thou (I thinke) reioyce, and rest at Home; Prouision Inn'd enough of euery thing, To giue thee glad heart, till the neighbour Spring; Not goe to others to supply thy store, But others, need to come to thee for more. If at the sunnes conuersion thou shalt sowe, The sacred Earth; Thou then, maist sit and mowe, Or reape in Haruest; such a little paine Will serue thy vse, to sell thy thin-growne Graine; And Reaps so scanty, will take vp thy hand; Thou hid in dust; Not comforted a sand, But gather gainst the graine. Thou shouldst be then, Coop't in a Basket vp; for worldly Men, Admire no vnthrifts: Honour goes by gaine. As times still change, so changeth Ioue his Minde, Whose Seasons, mortall Men can hardly finde. But if thou shouldst sowe late, this well may be, In all thy slacknesse, an excuse for thee. When, in the Oakes greene armes the Cuckoe sings, And first delights Men in the louely springs; If much raine fall, 'tis fit then to defer Thy sowing worke. But how much raine to beare, And let no labour to that Much, giue eare, Past intermission, let Ioue steepe the grasse Three daies to gether, so he do not passe An Oxes hoofe in depth; and neuer stay, To strowe thy seed in: but if deeper way Ioue, with his raine makes; then forbeare the field: For late sowne then, will past the formost yield. Minde well all this, nor let it fly thy powrs, To knowe what fits, the white springs earely flowrs; Nor when raines timely fall; Nor when sharp colde In winters wrath, doth men from worke withholde Sit by smiths forges, nor warme tauernes hant; Nor let the bitterest of the season dant Thy thrift-arm'd paines, like idle Pouertie; For then the time is when th'industrious Thie Vpholdes, with all increase, his Familie. With whose rich hardnes spirited, do thou, Poore Delicacie flie; lest frost and snowe, Fled for her loue; Hunger sit both them out, And make thee, with the beggers lazie gout, Sit stooping to the paine, still pointing too't, And with a leane hand, stroke a foggie foot. The slothfull man, expecting many things, With his vaine hope, that cannot stretch her wings Past need of necessaries for his kinde, Turnes like a whirle-pit ouer, in his minde All meanes that Rapine prompts to th'idle Hinde; Sits in the tauerne; and findes meanes to spend Ill got; and euer, doth to worse contend. When Summer therefore in her Tropicke sits; Make thou thy seruants weare their winter wits, And tell them this, ere that warme season wast, Make nests; for Summer will not euer last. The month of Ianuaries all-ill daies, For Oxens good; shun now by Iulies raies. When aires chill North his noisome frosts shall blowe All ouer earth, and all the wide sea throwe At Heauen in hills; from colde horse-breeding Thrace; The beaten earth, and all her Syluane race Roring and bellowing with his bitter strokes; Plumps of thick firre-trees, and high-crested Okes; Torne vp in vallies, all Aires floud let flie In him, at Earth; sad nurse of all that die. Wilde beasts abhor him; and run clapping close Their stern's betwixt their thighes; and euen all those, Whose hides, their fleeces line, with highest proofe; Euen Oxe-hides also want expulsiue stuffe; And bristled goates, against his bitter gale: He blowes so colde, he beates quite through them all. Onely with silly sheepe it fares not so; For they, each Summer fleec't, their fells so growe, They shield all winter, crusht into his winde. He makes the olde Man trudge for life, to finde Shelter against him, but he cannot blast The tender, and the delicately-grac't Flesh of the virgin; she is kept within, Close by her mother, carefull of her skin; Since yet she neuer knew, how to enfolde The force of Uenus swimming all in golde. Whose snowie bosome choicely washt and balm'd, With wealthy oiles; she keepes the house becalm'd, All winters spight; when in his fire-lesse shed, And miserable roofe still hiding head; The bonelesse fish doth eat his feet for colde. To whom the sunne doth neuer food vnfolde; But turnes aboue the blacke Mens populous towrs, On whom he more bestowes his radiant howres, Then on th' Hellenians; then all Beasts of horne; And smooth brow'd, that in beds of wood are borne, About the Oken dales; that North-winde flie, Gnashing their teeth, with restlesse miserie; And euery where, that Care solicits all, That (out of shelter) to their Couerts fall, And Cauerns eaten into Rocks; and then, Those wilde Beasts shrink, like tame three footed Men, Whose backs, are broke with Age, and forheads driuen To stoope to Earth; though borne to looke on Heauen. Euen like to these; Those tough-bred rude ones, goe, Flying the white drifts of the Northerne Snowe. Then put thy Bodies best munition on; Soft wastecotes, vveeds that th' Ankles traile vpon; And, with a little linnen, vveaue much wull, In fore-wouen webs; and make thy Garments full: And these put on thee; lest thy harsh-growne haire Tremble vpon thee, and into the Aire Start, as affrighted; all that brest of thine, Pointed with Bristles like a Porcupine. About thy feet, see fitted Shooes be tied, Made of a strongly-dying Oxes Hide; Lin'd with wool socks: Besides, when those winds blow, Thy first fallen Kid-skinnes; sure together sowe, With Oxes sinewes, and about thee throwe, To be thy refuge, gainst the soking Raine. Vpon thy head, a quilted Hat sustaine, That from thy eares, may all Aires spight expell. When North-windes blowe, the Aire is sharp and fell; But Morning Aire, that brings a warmth withall, Downe from the Stars, and on the earth doth fall; Expires a breath, that (all things chearing then) Is fit to crowne the works of blessed Men. Which drawing out of floods, that euer flow; Winde-stormes are rais'd on Earth, that roughly blow; And then, sometimes, a shower falls toward Euen; And sometime Aire, in empty blasts is driuen. Which, from the North-winde rising out of Thrace, And gloomy clowds rais'd; haste thee home apace; Thy worke for that day done; th' euent foreseen, Lest, out of Heauen, a darke clowd hide thee cleane, Thy weeds wet through, and steep thee to the skin; But shun it; for vvhen this colde Moneth comes-in; Extreame it is for sheep, extreame for men; Take from thy Oxen halfe their Commons then, But mend thy seruants; for ingenious Night, Then, great in length, affects the Appetite, With all contention, and alacritie, To all Inuention, and the scrutinie Of all our obiects; and must therefore feast, To make the spirits runne high in their Inquest. These well obseruing, all the yeares Remaine, The Daies and Nights grow equall; till, againe, Earth, that of all things is the Mother Queen; All fruits, promiscuously, brings forth for Men. When, after sixtie turnings of the Sun, By Ioues Decrees; all vvinters houres are run; Then does the Euening-starre, Arcturus, rise, And leaue th'vnmeasur'd Ocean; all Mens eyes, Frst, noting then his Beames; and, after him, Before the cleere Morns light, hath chast the Dim; Pandions Swallow, breakes out with her Mone; Made to the Light; the Spring but new put on. Preuenting vvhich; cut Vines, for then tis best. But vvhen the horn'd house-bearer leaues his rest, And climes the Plants; the seuen Starres then in flight; No where digge Vines; but Sithes vvhet, and excite Seruants to vvorke: flie shadie Tauerne boures; And Beds, as soone as light salutes the floures. In Haruest, when the Sunne the bodie dries; Then haste, and fetch the Fields home; earely rise, That Plentie may, thy House-hould wants suffice: The Morne, the third part of thy worke doth gaine; The Morne, makes short thy way, makes short thy paine; The Morne, being once vp, fils the waies with all, And yokes the Oxe, her selfe vp, in his stall. When once the Thistle doth his flower prefer; And on the Tree, the garrulous Grashopper, Beneath her wings; all Day, and all Night long, Sits pouring out, her derisorie song; When Labour drinks, his boyling sweat to thriue: Then Gotes grow fat; then best wine chuse; then striue Women for worke most; and Men least can do; For then, the Dog-starre, burns his drouth into, Their braines, and knees, and all the Bodie dries; But then, betake thee, to the shade that lies, In shield of Rocks; drinke Biblian wine, and eate, The creamie wafer; Gotes milke that the Teate, Giues newly free; and nurses Kids no more. Flesh of Bow-browsing Beeues, that neuer bore; And tender Kids. And to these, taste black wine, The third part water, of the Crystaline, Still flowing fount, that feeds a streame beneath; And sit in shades, where temperate gales may breath On thy oppos'd cheeks; when Orions raies, His influence, in first Ascent assaies. Then to thy labouring seruants giue command, To dight the sacred gift of Ceres hand; In some place windie, on a well-plan'd floore; Which, all by measure, into Vessels poure; Make then, thy Man-swaine, one that hath no House; Thy hand-maid, one, that hath nor child, nor Spouse; Hand-maids, that children haue, are rauenous. A Mastiffe likewise, nourish still at home; Whose teeth are sharp, and close as any Combe; And meat him well, to keep with stronger guard, The Day-sleep-wake-Night Man, from forth thy yard; That else thy Goods into his Caues will beare. Inne Hay, and Chaffe enough, for all the yeare, To serue thy Oxen, and thy Mules; and then, Lose them; and ease the deare knees of thy Men. When Syrius, and Orions aspire To Heauens steep height; and bright Arcturus fire, The rosie-fingerd Morning sees arise; O Perses, then, thy Vineyard faculties See gather'd, and got home. Which twice fiue Daies, And Nights no lesse, expose to Phœbus Raies; Then fiue Daies, Inne them, and in Vessels close, The gift, the gladnes-causing God bestowes. But after, that the Seuen-stars, and the Fiue, That twixt the Bulls hornes, at their set arriue; Together with the great Orions force; Then plie thy Plough, as fits the Seasons course. If, of a Chance-complaining Man, at Seas, The humor take thee; when the Pleiades, Hide head, and flie the fierce Orions, chace; And the darke-deep Oceanus embrace; Then diuerse Gusts of violent windes arise; And then attempt, no Nauall enterprise. But ply thy Land affaires; and draw ashore, Thy Ship; and fence her round, with stonage store, To shield her Ribs, against the humorous Gales; Her Pump exhausted, lest Ioues rainie falls, Breed putrefaction. All tooles fit for her; And all her tacklings, to thy House confer; Contracting orderly, all needfull things, That Imp a water-treading Vessels wings. Her well-wrought Sterne, hang in the smoke at home, Attending time, till fit Sea Seasons come. And then thy swift Saile lanch, conueying in, Burthen, that richly way that Trade begin; As did our Father; who a voiage went, For want of an Estate so competent, As free life askt; and long since landed here; When he had measur'd the vnmeasur'd Spheere, Of all the Sea; Aeoliam Cumas leauing; Not flying wealth (Reuenews great receiuing; And Blisse it selfe possest, in all fit store; If wisely vsde; yet selling that t'explore Strange Countries, madly couetous of more; But onely shunning lothsome Pouertie; Which yet Ioue sends, and Men should neuer flie. The seat that he was left to dwell vpon, Was set in Ascra, neare to Helicon; Amids a miserable Village there; In winter vile, in summer noisomer; And profitable neuer. Note thou then, To doe all workes; the proper Season, when; In Sea-workes chiefly. For whose vse allow A little Ship; but in her bulke bestow, A great bigge Burthen; the more Ships sustaine, The surer saile they; and heap Gaine on Gaine: If Seas run smooth, and rugged Gusts abstaine. When thy vaine Minde then, would Sea-ventures try; In loue, the Land-Rocks of loath'd Debt to fly; And Hunger's-euer harsh-to-heare of cry: Ile set before thee all the Trim, and Dresse, Of those still-roaring-noise-resounding Seas; Though neither skild, in either Ship, or Saile, Nor euer was at Sea; Or, lest I faile, But for Eubœa once; from Aulis where The Greeks, with Tempest driuen, for shore did stere Their mighty Nauie, gatherd to employ, For sacred Greece; gainst faire-dame-breeding Troy; To Chalcis there, I made by Sea my Passe; And to the Games of great Amphidamas; Where many afore-studied Exercise, Was instituted, with excitefull prise, For great-and-good, and able-minded Men: And where I wonne, at the Pierean Pen, A three-ear'd Tripod, which I offerd on, The Altars of the Maids of Helicon. Where first their loues initiated me, In skill of their vnworldly Harmony. But no more practise haue my trauailes swet, In many-a-naile-composed ships; and yet, Ile sing what Ioues Minde will suggest in mine, Whose daughters taught my verse the rage diuine. Fifty daies after Heauens conuerted heate, When Summers land-works are dissolu'd with sweat; Then growes the nauigable season fit: For then no stormes rise, that thy saile may split, Nor spoile thy sailers. If the God that swaies Th' earth-shaking Trident, doe not ouerpaise, With any counsaile, before hand decreed, The seasons naturall grace, to thy good speed; Nor Ioue consent with his reuengefull will; In whom are fixt the bounds of good and ill. But in the vsuall temper of the yeare, Easie to iudge of, and distinguish cleare, Are both the windes, and seas; none rude, none crosse, Nor mis-affected with the loue of losse. And therefore put to sea; trust euen the winde Then, with thy swift ship; but when thou shalt finde Fit freight for her; as fitly stowe it strait; And all haste home make. For no new wine waite, Nor aged Autumnes showres; nor winters falls, Then fast approaching; Nor the noisome gales, The humorous South breathes, that incense the seas, And raise together in one series Ioues Autumne dashes, that come smoking downe, And with his roughest brows make th' Ocean frowne. But there's another season for the seas, That in the first spring others choices please; When, looke how much the Crowe takes at a stride, So much, put forth, the yong leafe is descride On Fig-tree tops. But then the gusts so fall, That oft the sea becomes imperviall. And yet this vernall season many vse, For sea affaires; which yet, I would not chuse; Nor giues it my minde any gratefull taste, Since then steales out so many a rauenous blast; Nor, but with much skath thou canst scape thy bane, Which yet, Mens greedy follies dare maintaine; Mony is soule to miserable Men: And to it many Men their soules bequeath. To dy in darke-seas is a dreadfull death. All this I charge thee, need to note no more; Nor in one vessell venture all thy store; But most part leaue out, and impose the lesse; For tis a wretched thing t'indure distresse Incurr'd at sea. And, tis as ill, ashore To vse aduentures, couetous of more Than safety warrants; As, vpon thy Waine To lay on more load than it can sustaine. For then, thy Axle breakes, thy goods diminish, And Thrifts meane meanes in violent Au'rice vanish. The Meane obseru'd, makes an exceeding slate. Occasion tooke at all times, equalls Fate. Thy selfe, if well in yeares; thy wife take home, Not much past thirtie; nor haue much to come: But being yong thy selfe; Nuptialls that sease, The times best season in their acts are these. At fourteene yeeres a woman growes mature, At fifteene, wed her; and best meanes inure, To marry her a Maid; to teach her then, Respect to thee, and chastnes t'other men. In chiefe chuse one, whose life is neere thee bred, That her condition circularly weighd, (And that with care too) in thy neighbours eies, Thou wedd'st not, for a Maide, their mockeries. No purchase passes a good wife, no losse Is, than a bad wife, a more cursed crosse, That must a gossip be at euery feast; And priuate cates prouide too for her guest; And beare her husband ne're so bolde a breast, Without a fire, burnes in him euen to rage, And in his youth poures griefe on him in age. The Gods forewarnings, and pursuits of Men, Of impious liues, with vnauoided paine; Their sight, their rule of all, their loue, their feare, Watching, and sitting vp, giue all thy care. Giue neuer to thy friend an euen respect, With thy borne brother; for, in his neglect, Thy selfe thou touchest first, with that defect. If thou shalt take thy friend with an offence, By word, or deed; twice onely, try what sense He hath of thy abuse, by making plaine The wrong he did thee: and if then againe He will turne friend, confesse, and pay all paine Due for his forfaite; take him into grace: The shamelesse Man shifts friends still with his place. But keepe thou friends, forgiue, and so conuert, That not thy looke may reprehend thy heart. Be not a common host for guests, nor one That can abide the kinde receipt of none. Consort none ill, though rais'd to any state; Nor leaue one good; though n'ere so ruinate. Abhor all taking pleasure to vpbraid A forlorne Pouertie, which God hath laid On any Man, in so seuere a kinde, As quite disheartens, and dissolues his Minde. Amongst Men on the earth there neuer sprung An ampler treasure than a sparing tongue. Which yet, most grace gaines, when it sings the Meane. Ill-speakers euer heare as ill againe. Make not thy selfe at any publique feast, A troublesome or ouercurious guest. Tis common cheare, nor touches thee at all; Besides, thy grace is much, thy cost is small. Doe not thy tongues grace the disgrace to lie, Nor mend a true-spoke Minde with policie; But all things vse with first simplicitie. To Ioue, nor no God poure out morning wine, With vnwasht hands: for, knowe, the powres diuine Auert their eares, and praiers impure reiect. Put not thy vrine out, with face erect Against the sun, but sitting let it fall, Or turne thee to some vndiscouering wall. And after the great Sunne is in descent, Remember, till he greet the Orient, That, in way, or without, thou still forbeare. Nor ope thy nakednes while thou art there. The nights the Gods are, and the Godly Man, And wise will shun by all meanes to prophane The Gods appropriates. Make no accesse (Thy wife new left) to sacred mysteries; Or coming from an ominous funerall feast; But from a banquet that the Gods haue blest In Men whose spirits are frolikely inclinde; Performe those rights that propagate thy kinde. Neuer, the faire waues of eternall flouds, Passe with thy feet, but first inuoke the Gods; Thine eies cast on their streames; Which those that wade, (Their hands vnwasht) those Deities inuade With future plagues: and euen then angrie are. Of thy fiue branches, see thou neuer pare The dry from off the greene, at solemne feasts: Nor on the quaffing Mazers of thy guests Bestow the boawle vowd, to the powres diuine; For harmefull fate is swallow'd with the wine. When thou hast once begun to build a house, Leau't not vnfinisht, lest the Ominous, Ill-spoken Crowe, encounter thee abroad, And from her bow, thy meanes outgone, explode. From three-foot pots of meat, set on the fire To serue thy house; serue not thy tasts desire With rauine of the Meate, till on the borde Thou seest it set and sacrifice afforde. Not if thou wash first, and the Gods wouldst please With that respect to them: for euen for these, Paines are imposde, being all Impieties. On tombe-stones, or fixt seats no boy permit, (That's growne to twelue yeares ould) to idlie sit; For tis not good, but makes a slothfull man. In bath's whose waters women first began To wash their bodies in, should bathe no Men. For, in their time, euen these parts haue their paine Grieuous enough. If any homely place, Syluane, or other, thou seest vowd to grace Of any God, by fire made for the weale Of any poore soule, mou'd with simplest zeale; Mock not the mysteries: for God disdaines Those impious parts, and paies them certaine paines. Neuer in channels of those streames that pay The Ocean tribute, giue thy vrine way; Nor into fountaines: but past all neglect, See thou auoid it: for the graue respect Giuen to these secrets, meetes with blest effect. Do this, and flie the peoples bitter fame, For Fame is ill: tis light and rais'd like flame; The burthen heauie yet, and hard to cast. No fame doth wholly perish, when her blast Eccho resounds in all the peoples cries, For she her selfe, is of the Deities. The end of the second Booke of works. HESIODS' BOOKE OF DAYES. The Daies, that for thy workes, are Good, or Ill, According to the Influence, they instill; Of Ioue with all care, learne, and giue them then, (For their discharge) in precept to thy Men. The thirtith Day of euery Moneth, is best With diligent inspection, to digest The next Moneths workes; and part thy house-hould foods: That being the Day, when all litigious Goods, Are iustly sentenc't, by the peoples voyces. And till that Daie, next Moneth, giue these Daies choyces; For they are markt out, by most-knowing Ioue. First, the first Day, in which the Moone doth mooue, With radiance renu'd. And then, the fourth, The seuenth Day, next; being first in sacred worth: For that Day, did Latona bring to light, The gould-sword-wearing Sun. Next then the eightth, And ninth, are Good; being both, Daies that retaine The Moones prime strength, t'instruct the works of Men. The leauenth and twelfth, are likewise both Good Daies; The twelfth yet, farre exceeds, the 'leuenths repaire; For that Day hangs the Spinner in the Aire; And weaues her web vp. So the Spinster, all Her Rock then ends, exposing it to sale. So Earth's third Huswife, the ingenious Ant, On that Day ends her Mole-hils cure of want. The Day her selfe, in their example then, Tasking her fire, and bounds her length to Men. The thirteenth Day, take care thou sowe no seed; To plant yet, tis a Day of speciall speed. The sixteenth Day, Plants set, prooue fruitlesse still; To get a Sonne tis good, a Daughter ill. Nor good to get, nor giue in Nuptials; Nor in the sixt Day, any Influence falls, To fashion her begetting Confluence. But to geld Kids, and Lambs, and Sheep-coats fence; It is a Day of much beneuolence: To get a Sonne, it good effects affords; And loues to cut ones heart, with bitter words. And yet it likes faire speeches too, and lies; And whispering out detractiue obloquies. The eight, the bellowing Bullock lib, and Gote; The twelfth, the labouring Mule; but if of note, For wisedome, and to make a Iudge of Lawes; To estimate, and arbitrate a Cause, Thou wouldst a Sonne get, the great twentith Day, Consort thy wife, when full the Morns broad Ray, Shines through thy windowes: for that Day is fit, To forme a great, and honourable wit. The tenth is likewise good, to get a Son; Fourteenth a Daughter; then lay hand vpon The Colt, the Mule, and horne-retorted Stere; And sore-bit Mastiffe; and their forces rere, To vsefull seruices. Be carefull then, The foure and twentith Day, (the bane of Men, Hurling amongst them) to make safe thy State; For tis a Day, of Death insatiate. The fourth Day, celebrate thy Nuptiall feast, All Birds obseru'd, that fit a Bridall best. All fift Daies, to effect affaires in, flie; Being all of harsh and horrid qualitie. For then, all vengefull spirits walke their Round, And haunt Men like their hand-maids; to confound Their faithles peace; whose plague Contention got. The seuenteenth Day, what Ceres did allot Thy Barnes in Haruest (since then view'd with care) Vpon a smooth floore; let the vinnoware, Dight, and expose, to the opposed Gale. Then, let thy Forrest-feller, cut thee all Thy Chamber fuell; and the numerous parts Of Nauall timber, apt for Ship-wrights Arts. The foure and twentith Day, begin to close Thy Ships of leake. The ninth Day neuer blowes Least ill at all on Men. The ninteenth Day, Yeelds (after Noone yet) a more gentle Ray; Auspicious, both to plant, and generate Both Sonnes and Daughters; ill to no estate. But the thrice ninth Daies Goodnes, few Men know; Being best Day of the whole Moneth, to make flow Both wine, and Corne-tuns; and to curb the force Of Mules and Oxen and the swift-hoou'd Horse. And then, the well-built Ship lanch. But few men, Know truth in any thing. Or where, or when To doe, or order, what they must doe, needs: Daies differencing, with no more care than deeds. The twice seuenth Day (for sacred worth) exceeds. But few Men, when the twentith Day is past, Which is the best Day (while the Morne doth last In her increasing power; though after Noone, Her grace growes faint) approue, or end that Moone, With any Care; Mans life, most pris'd, is least: Though lengthlesse; spent as endless. Fowle and Beast Farre passing it, for Date. For all the store Of yeares, Man boasts; the prating Crowe hath more, By thrice three liues. The long-liu'd Stagge, foure parts, Exceeds the Crowes Time; the Rauens Age; the Harts, Triples in durance; all the Rauens long Date, The Phœnix, ninefolde doth reduplicate. Yet Nymphs (the blest seed of the Thunderer) Ten liues out-last the Phœnix. But preferre Good life, to long life; and obserue these Daies, That must direct it; being to all Mens waies Of excellent conduct. All the rest but sound's, That follow falls; meere vaine and haue no grounds: But, one doth one Day praise; another, other; Few knowing the truth. This Day becomes a Mother; The next, a Step-dame. But, be Man still one; That Man a happy Angell waites vpon; Makes rich, and blessed, that through all these Daies Is knowingly emploid. In all his waies, (Betwixt him and the Gods) goes still vnblam'd. All their forewarnings, and suggestions fram'd, To their obedience; being directly view'd: All Good endeauour'd, and all Ill eschew'd. The end of Hesiods Works, and Daies.</field>
