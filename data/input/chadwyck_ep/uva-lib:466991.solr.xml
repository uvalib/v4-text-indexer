      <field name="fulltext">THE SOUL'S DEPARTURE Oh let me die at dawn, The stir of living men Would call my waning spirit back Unto its home again. But at the early light Existence seems afar, Back in the depths of parted time As fading planets are. Let me go forth alone, Before the sun uprise, And meet the springing of the morn In its own distant skies. Yes! let me die at dawn, The stir of living men Would call my waning spirit back Unto its home again. EARLY DAWN âLOVE AND HOPE So ends the glory of the night, So dreary doth the morn appear, So pale my spirit's waning light, So joyless to be lingering here. Are stars, indeed, but dying fires? Is dawn, indeed, so deathly cold? Gray images of chance desires, That perish whilst their leaves unfold? Is all my soul's unquenchÃ©d love But the faint shadow of a dream? Must all my hopes unstable prove Uncertain bubbles of a stream? Shall all my heart's outgoings back Unto their silent stream returnâ No mingling waters in their track? Dull lesson which with years I learn! That early light repaireth not The ending lustre of the sky; So sadly fails my forward thought I hope, to weepâI love, to die. Oh, inward, wasting, loving flame That warms none other breast than mine, Which ever burns alone, the same In my own being's depths to shine! Not here affection finds its scope, Its heritage is fixed above. Where shall my heart secure its hope? When shall my spirit rest in love? 1841. SONG [Make bright thy locks and seek the sun] Make bright thy locks and seek the sun, Lest home-fed thoughts turn back To idle words which almost won Thy heart into their track. My soul can never dwell with thee; And it were vain to waste The strength of youth in loving me, Whose prime is overcast. Life glitters on thy perfect brow, Thy keen and tender eyes, As on those chancel windows now The glance of evening lies. 1839. SONG [Vow no more: I did not think] Vow no more: I did not think Love could die so soon; Sigh deceit to other maidens Underneath the moon: Sing thy songs beneath their bowers; Gather them thy choicest flowers. Weep no more: thy tears are false As a morning vapour; Write no more thy lays of love By thy midnight taper: Love is fading in my bosom, Like a rose-tree's scattered blossom. Yet I thought thou once wast true, Even as now I doubt thee; I can never smile again If I live without thee. Was the treachery in thy will? Dost thou surely love me still? 1841. TO LEUCONOE (From Horace, Lib. i. Ode 11) Leuconoe, seek not thou to know The years the gods reserve to thee, Nor bid Chaldean numbers show The flowing hours awaiting me. 'Twere better we should meet and brave The stroke of fate or fortune's shock, Than count far winters by the wave Which wearies on the Tyrrhene rock. Be wise and pour the oblivious wine; Narrow thy hope and seize thy joy: One spacious moment now is thine, Which fruitless care would quite destroy. FROM HORACE (Lib. i. Ode 34) Dupe of the fool's philosophy, For the fool's heaven I spread my sail, And prayed cold prayers without avail, And sent no incense to the sky. Lo! fierce across the tranquil blue Jove's chariot sped, his white bolt fell, Dividing swift the gates of hell, Brute earth, and wandering waters too. The roots of shuddering Atlas quake, I trembling turn my vagrant prow, And hasten back my knee to bow To Him who thus in thunder spake. For God can smite the highest down, And lift the lowliest from beneath, While fortune, strong as love or death, Gives to the churl the monarch's crown. RETROSPECTION Restless clouds of dusky gray Fill the sky at shut of day, Wandering on in solemn hosts, Flitting dark and purposeless As a vessel in distress; Flitting on like unlaid ghosts. Where the gusty south wind passes, Bending all the tufted grasses, Sighing in the bladed sedge By the moorland water's edge, Making every bulrush whistle, Blowing down from every thistle. On the slope of every hill Seems to shudder every tree, Every poplar seems to be Sighing loud against its will; Little riplets sweep the river, Blinding every clear reflection, Driven in this and that direction As the curdling waters shiver. Where the sky has any light, 'Tis a wild and fearful gleam, Like the spiritual beam Of the lonely northern night, Where the muffled sledges go, Flying shades in wastes of snow. Not a star can pierce the cover Where those wide-winged shadows hover; Nor a note of any bird When the wind a moment ceases, And the sand-drifts fall to pieces; Not a chirrup can be heard. Oh, how very strange and lonely To be walking in the meadows, As a shadow blown with shadows; As it were a spirit only! Not a memory of the sun Crosses the gray waste of thought, But the silent dead are brought From their coffins one by one. He whose voice long since would utter What thy lips unconscious mutter, Words of sweet and solemn warning Spoken till thy heart was stilled, And ye paced about the field, Silent in the breezy morning. He whose steady, strong desire, Like a slow-consuming fire, Waited year by year to see Excellence excelled by thee, Heart to wish and thought to plan Noblest destinies for man, With sublime solicitude, Yearning for the loftiest goodâ Far into the winter's night Loved to sit and meditate In the chambers of his mind, While he listened to the wind, O'er the spirit's separate state Weaving chains of argument, With his earnest eyebrows bent; Till the mighty issues brought Stronger faith to purer thought:â If his disembodied soul Stood before thee, thou wouldst be Fearless, while thou saidst, 'Tis he! She round whom thy arm would twine When the summer sun was sinking, And your mutual eyes were drinking, Thou from hers and she from thine: All the fragrance of the clover, And the glimmering hedge-roses, Closing as the daylight closes, Come and flood thy memory over; For the clover and the daisies, Which the sun unthinking raises, Seven new springs have blown above her, She the lost to thee the lover. IN THE NIGHT Many bells are tolling slow, Midnight past two hours ago. Lightly echoing drips the rain; Ghostly lies the window-pane Slanting on the shadowy walls Where the street lamp's radiance falls. Sleepless, I am staring wide, Thought and Silence at my side. Wave the hand but close the lip, And in floating fellowship Lead my spirit here and there, Wavering like a gossamer Over London dim and vast, Lengthened street and ample square, Park and garden, tower and stair, Spire and dome and creaking mast. Dreadful London, vast and dim, What thou art no man can tell, Brain and sense and reason swim, Scarcely dare my spirit dwell On thy mingled heaven and hellâ Scarcely watch That dark river's quivering lamps Struggling through its folded damps. OBLIVION Oblivion claims and equals all Of that which was and that which is; I hear the distant torrent fall And crumble in the dumb abyss. I see the foaming ages sweep To perish in the utter deep. Why, throbbing heart, wilt thou impose Thy treasured toil on thankless death, Who neither aim nor value knows, But flings the jewelled drop beneath The tear-drifts ever plunging down As rich, as fruitless as thine own? For dying ever, ever born, Much done and nought accomplishÃ©d, Man is his own, his fellow's scorn, He envies and laments the dead, And, panting still for something new, Nought does but they were wont to do. The circuit of the whirling winds Scoffs rudely at his vague desires, Which neither law nor fulness binds, Whom the sweet course of nature tires, Who, where broad rivers greet the sea, Mourns only their monotony. Oh, cease thy dread o'er-labouring course, Thou myriad-tongued, relentless Time! My soul is crushed beneath thy force Of countless motions raised sublime Before the view of human thought, Whose order it inherits not. Here, stretched upon the mountain grass, I see the imperious sun ascend, And watch the sparkling moments pass, As from the giddy zenith tend Those fiery wheels, till he in haste Has like a gasping racer passed. Then anguished in the twilight see, With brimming eyes, the lofty sage, Who watched in deep antiquity That sun fulfil his pilgrimage. His hopes, his tears, with mine the same, Earth bears no echo of his name. I bless the dead, whose scattered dust Has joined new forms of shifting life; I bless the soul escaped its trust, Its bonds, its wonder, and its strife; Thee, Christ, I bless, who Death o'erthrew, Whose spirit maketh all things new. ASPIRATION O God, we sigh in Thee to rest, With life's strange burden much opprest; For us to be with Christ is best. Grateful that Thou hast brought us here Through mists of doubt and dens of fear, We wait till Thou our Lord appear. For we would love, where love no more Shall with dark frosts be wrinkled o'er, Or, lost, in idle channels pour: For we would know the shapely whole Which Thou hast given to the soul For its dominion and controlâ The full-orbed mysteries of the sky Which here in glittering fragments lie, And all our baby wonderings try: While now with glee, and now with dread, In small experiment we tread Among the living and the dead: Peering into the daisy's crown, Until its wonders deep have grown A mighty gulf to drink us down. And, but that wonder speaks of Thee, How sad, amidst infinity, With life and death unsolved, to be! O Life of Life! O Peace unknown! What though the whole creation groan, Thou knowest and Thou lov'st Thine own. And in the solitary place, Where still and sad Thy suppliant prays, Thou showest in his soul Thy face: And to the dusky world unseen His unchained spirit walks within In glistering garments, white and clean. THE LITTLE POOL There is a little pool in fields remote (Not many seek it, or admire when found), Thick set with rushes and broad-bladed flags In all its creeks among the twisted roots Of gray old willow-trees; and half-creamed o'er With pulpy weed, and five-leaved water-flowers; And in its opening centre, deepening down Into the fathomless inverted heaven, Small dwarf-oaks, and the crimpy hazel, shake On breezy days beside the fragrant thorn That hems it in; and many a little birdâ Still robin, timorous wren, coquetting finch, Shy blackbirdâin among their trembling boughs Have sung and loved for twenty summers past. The oxen's lowing is the loudest sound Heard by this brink, save when, with sudden roar, The thunder stoops and bellows on the ground Among the pastures, and its fiery breath One ghastly instant shows the startled trees Nodding with terror o'er the blackened wave. All other sounds are soft and sweet and low; Light winds pass flute-like all the afternoon Among the reeds; and wild bees, as they pass To neighbouring clover, bring their soothing hum To vibrate in the airs that fan its breast; The cuckoo, when the days are warm and still, Comes quietly above, and satisfied With two plain notes, repeats them o'er and o'er; While stock-doves, hidden in the dusky firs Of belting thickets, tremulous reply. The coot has made her nest within a cove Guarded by tangled roots and hanging grass, And he, who in the hot midday will come Slily across the thistles, there may see The fleet of four black chicks securely sail Into that harbour at her bagpipe callâ One plaintive anxious noteâherself unseen; Or, sitting for awhile upon the bank, May watch the little world of happy life Beneath and on the surface; down below The glossy velvet tadpoles wriggle round The entangled water-weeds, while on the top Flies, numerous, dart along, or steer across,â Some in a coat of green and purple mail, The roving corsairs of their little sea; Some trembling on their long, tenacious legs, Swaying like tiny chariots hung with springs,â Or spiral troops of ever restless gnats Whirl round and tease the eye to dizziness. So full and vital is this nameless pool, And yet so quiet, that its life might be Made to portray the tranquil life of thought Where glittering images sport noiselessly, And fancies, chased by reason, flutter o'er The depths through which the heaven of the heart Lies, the calm reflex of the eternal heaven. PARAPHRASEâPSALM XVI. Preserve the soul whose humble trust Will never cease to call Thee mine: The ever Pure, the ever Just, Who dost in Thine own lustre shine: For ever giving; for Thy store Flows unreplenished evermore. How can my goodness profit Thee? And yet my heart like Thine must flow; Therefore with those I yearn to be Who most resemble Thee below, That all the rapture of my breast May spend its floods in outspread rest. Ah, Lord, Thou only fount of blissâ There is no other God besideâ I start with hideous phantasies To see the big upheaving tide Of growing griefs hem in the crowd, Whose heads at idol shrines are bowed. Their chalices of foaming gore Pressed madly to blaspheming lips, My shuddering hand shall never pour, Unclasped in heathen fellowships; No name of mystic wickedness My thankless tongue shall ever bless. The Lord fulfils my brimming cup: He is my tranquil heritage. 'Tis Thou, unseen, who buildest up The lot of my advancing ageâ Dost mark each pleasant boundary Wherein my goodly portions lie. Thee will I bless, whose secret voice, In the still midnight counsels me, And makes my quiet veins rejoice With inmost knowledge fresh from Thee Who stand'st beside me and before, And mak'st me moveless by Thy power. Therefore my joys for ever spring; My glory ever triumpheth; Though Time's remorseless years will bring My flesh into the dust of death, There will I rest in certain hope And wait till Thou shalt raise me up. Whence strike these strange prophetic beams; New powers which I can never tell? I see a light that darts and streams Up from the hidden deeps of hell; I see Thy Holy One arise From blank corruption to the skies. Death's unproductive dignity Thy soul can never tolerate, Thou Lord of Life, nor e'er on Thee The grave shall shut its mouldering gate; Nor suffer God-engendered clay To melt in its foul arms away. Show me that radiant, upward road To where the urns of joy are full, Fast by the crystal throne of God, Where creeping mists can never dullâ Those fruitful lands that always lie Girt round with Immortality. PARAPHRASEâPSALM XLV. Merry heart within me sing, Tune the laughing lyre again, Fluent tongue and flying pen, Spread the praises of the king. Fairest, dearest, best beloved, From thy honey-flowing lips Grace or wisdom ever drips, By the mind of God approved. O most mighty, gird thy sword, Mount thy white horse pacing high, Clothed with dazzling majesty, Ride in state before the Lord! White-robed warrants of success, Meekness, Truth, before thee ride; But the blade is flashing wide Which shall every wrong redress. Keen and swift thine arrows fly In among the serried crowd; Darkly frowning, scoffing loud, Smitten through and through they die. Steadfast crown and sceptre calm Shine upon thy stable throne Built in righteousness alone, Fragrant with the anointing balm. Incense rises from thy robe, Myrrh and cassia's odorous sighs From the ivory palace rise, Fill the sky and flood the globe. Bending beauties wreathed and crowned, Who on knees of kings were nursed, Stand: thy Queen in order first: Wait thy wish and gird thee round. Musing while the maidens sing, Listen what the voices say: âLeave thy lesser loves to-day; Spread thy beauty to the king.â Tyrian maids bring purple gifts; Wealth comes hoping to appease: All things crowd thy will to please, As the coloured pageant shifts. See the monarch's daughter move Splendid soul'd, while Ophir's sheen, Ruby, sapphire, topaz keen, Glisten in the light of love! Trooping virgins, hymning choirs, Pass the lofty palace doors, Throng the vast and gleaming floors, Sing and strike the thrilling lyres. Fruitful bride, thou wilt not fade; Sons and daughters born to thee Sit for ever on thy knee With thy name immortal made. Sept. 30, 1868. PARAPHRASEâJOB XXXVIII. When down beneath the lowest deep, Earth's central mass all formless lay In swaddling bands of ancient sleep, Gigantic whispers far away Of coming order fanned the brow Of Chaos, while the corner-stone Was meted out by hands unknown And mystic plummets, where wast thou? When with a vague and golden stream, The wondering light gazed softly down; When pealed a fresh and awful hymn, And heavenly trumpets loudly blown Rang out from many a shining row Of seraphs wheeling round the sphere Before the forming of the yearâ Before the sunrise, where wast thou? Before the ever-murmuring Sea Rolled in its first inquietude, While all its gaping chasms were free From gurgling wave and boiling flood, Shut up behind its dusky bars, Unconscious of its human prey, Unstained with blood the monster lay, Nor trembled to the trembling stars, Where thou? Did ever thy commands Give vast effulgence to the morn When to the expectant shepherd bands It rose o'er pastured hills forlornâ O'er eastern heights of pearly snow, O'er budding copse and breathing mead, Did heavenly daysprings ever heed, Or upward at thy bidding go? Or have thy prying eyeballs seen The folded shadows hovering round Those mournful doors where all within Rest in one wide oblivion bound; Where towering ghosts with stony gaze Enwrapped in vital silence stand To take thee by thy freezing hand And lead thee down their darkening ways? When Winter's wealth of sparkling flakes Engendered in the womb of heaven, Down from its lofty treasury breaks, When dews fall soft, when thunder-riven Wild clouds were shattered in the sky, And east winds chase their vagrant bandsâ Was it that with thy haughty hands Thou didst lift up thy voice on high? When was it that thine ordinance Wheeled up Orion from the deep, Or stayed the light entangled dance Of Pleiades, who ever keep Their dreamy watchfires quivering o'er The dim abysses of the sky, While great Arcturus wanders by, And slumber broods from shore to shore? When Summer splits the gasping fields, And river shallows noiseless run, And every herb thy pasture yields Lies sick beneath the blinding sun, Speak thou and stay the sobbing cloud In the swollen South that mourns the dearth, And send it from the panting earth To plunge beneath its ocean shroud! Go, curb yon banded unicorn, Soothe those wild asses of the hill; Go, see the ostrich laugh to scorn The javelin'd horseman and his skill; Go, hold the thundering charger's rein, And bid him stand when captain's shout, And shuddering clarions round about With echoes fill the reeling plain! Bid the strong eagle fan the storm, And hawks cleave southward with the wind; Entrap the vast behemoth's form, Or with thy snares his sinews bind; Pierce thou that strong leviathan With spears, his fiery snortings face, Or, fierce, his gleaming terrors chase, And prove the perfect strength of man! Oh, wilt thou with thy Lord contend, Poor fluttering moth which yesterday Could scarce the filmy barriers rend Of that dark chamber where it lay? Nay, rather hide thee in the dust Beneath the eternal might of God, Who wields the sceptre, shakes the rod, And own that all His ways are just. A THOUGHT OF GOD As children dip their fingers in the waves And feel a shuddering gladness while they see Their dazzling myriads glitter to the shore, And hear the wide pervading consonance That never ceases either night or day, But fills the hollow caverns of the soul And makes them sound with vague and wordless thought, That seeks, but never finds, an utterance: Even so, O Lord, is any thought of Thee. Like the deep powers that clothe us when the woods In summer midnights rest beneath their leaves, When the full moon stands steadfastly in heaven, And white stars tremble through the blackened firs Above a steep and gurgling ravine That throbs with passion of the nightingale, And strong imaginations lift us up To float in visions never seen by day: So wondrous, Lord, is any thought of Thee. As in the hamlet meadows, while the sun Sinks through rich elms and humming sycamores, And gilds the mosses of an ancient oak Where coos the ring-doveâgilds the chestnut flowers And turns the countless gnats to sparks of gold, And pensive flushes o'er the low church tower, Whence beats the voice of Time in rings of sound That seem to vanish in eternity: So sweet, O Lord, is any thought of Thee. As o'er a vast and blossoming champaign, Its countless fields, its orchards, and its cots Lashed round with roses, mounts the gladdening sun Dancing on every brook and window pane; While all at once the woods burst forth in song, And every flower-bank waves its fragrances, And early labourers whistle to the morn, And curly milkmaids sing among the herds, And every daisy opens wide its cup To drink the sunbeams and the flashing dews, And gleaming gossamers sow the earth with light: So glad, O Lord, are all who think on Thee. So fathomless, so wondrous, and so sweet, So glad, O Lord, the thoughts of dying men Who meditate on Thee amid thy works: Thou, who didst make the mystery of the soul, And set therein the mystery of the world, Teach us to see Thee ever, that the abyss Of craving and unsatisfied desire, And longings that o'er-arch the firmament, May rest in widening fulness till the hour That makes Thy universe complete in Thee. QUIET HEARTS Quiet hearts ye needs must have, Ye who dwell beneath His wings, Though ye carry to the grave Common thoughts of common things; Though ye into sin were born, And into the dust return. For ye nourish in your breast, Where no human soul can pry, Wondrous thoughts of perfect rest In a bright Immensity; Thoughts that angel vigils keep While ye work and while ye weep. But your slow and stammering tongue Cannot boast the unuttered calm, Cannot shape your thought to song, Mount nor burn in fiery psalm; Scarcely into thought can move From the quiet depths of Love. March 1854. IMMORTAL LOVE Who knows the endless wealth of love? How far its wingÃ¨d odours move? When Mary brake with breaking heart Her spikenard o'er her Master's head, She chose, as erst, the better part; Embalmed at once the quick and dead. We smell on earth its fragrance still, It curls and wreathes on Zion's hill; For as its incense rose sublime, From heart and alabaster riven, It filled the ample house of time, And every golden hall of heaven. THE HUNDREDFOLD REWARD (Acts iv. 36, 37) Joses the Levite paced his acres wide, Like Isaac in the fields at eventide: He sowed, he reaped, his long fleeced sheep he sheared, His ox he watered, or his lambs he reared, And thought, perhaps, to end his simple days Where cool trees whispered o'er his silent ways. Time changes all things: other footsteps trod Those dear possessions of the man of God; His heart he gave, and then his land he sold For Him who pays in coin more rich than gold; Through many unknown lands he strayed and taught Of treasures hidden in a field unbought; The broken heart he healed, the lost he found, Opened blind eyes, and stanched the mortal wound, Cast forth fierce devils, ushered angels in, Cleared out bright spaces in the wilds of sin: Then rested in the fields of Asphodel, Where saints have all, and neither buy nor sell; And through all Time's long hours high fame he won, God's prophet pure, and Consolation's Son. 1868. AN ANTIDOTE TO CARE Think that the grass upon thy grave is green; Think that thou seest thine own empty chair; The empty garments thou wast wont to wear; The empty room where long thy haunt hath been: Think that the lane, the meadow, and the wood And mountain summit feel thy foot no more, Nor the loud thoroughfare, nor sounding shore: All mere blank space where thou thyself hast stood. Amid this thought-created silence say To thy stripped soul, what am I now and where? Then turn and face the petty narrowing care Which has been gnawing thee for many a day, And it will die as dies a wailing breeze Lost in the solemn roar of boundless seas. THE SERIOUSNESS OF LIFE Seeing that life is but the Argument To the great Book of Immortality; That heaven's divine sufficiencies must be The expanse of that on which our life is spent,â But of such only as is finished well; How what is well requires both care and pain; Of what grave wisdom we have need to spell That which is true, since only truth can gain The meed of wisdomâit should give to thought The cast of reverent fear: for mirth looks strange In watchful eyes that mark how being's range Widens and fills and blooms, as seeds are brought From least to greatest by the omnific power Which wraps Eternity within an hour. THE SINGLE WISH One thing, O Lord, do I desire, Withhold not Thou the wish from me, Which warms me like a secret fire, That I, Thy child, may dwell with Thee! Dwell in Thy house for evermore, Thy wondrous beauty to behold, And make inquiry as of yore, Till all Thy will to me is told. In this pavilion have I hid, These many years when hurt by sin, Or by my angry sorrows chid, Or deaf with life's unceasing din. Blown hither by the blasts of fear, Or stooping with the weight of care, My feet have hastened year on year, With psalm of praise or sigh of prayer. Fear tells my heart that I may be Some day an alien from Thy door, May cease Thy lovely face to see, And hear Thy whispers nevermore! This woe hath not befallen yet: Shall it, O Rock of Strength, befal? Then were my sun for ever set, And dropped in that abyss my all! Tell me this hour shall never come; Plant me so deep Thy Courts among That I may have my final home, And end where I began my song! Nov. 3, 1868. MACHPELAH This small green field, these ancient shadowy trees, This dim o'er-arching cave, are like a nest To which my aged senses flee for calm: Though I have gloried in the open plains, With boundless distances and mountain bourns; And I remember, how in Haran's vales, When the red evening lay along the west, We wandered through the palm grove hand in hand; I strong, she beauteous, the desire of kings, We in the summer morns sat by the wells While the young lambs were bleating, and the air Was cleft by swallows, and the camel chewed The cud with musing eye and smiling lip, While the spouts gurgled, and the troughs were filled, And brown, black-bearded herdsmen sang their songs: For I, too, once was young, and she, my bride, Went in and out among the milky flocks; I heard her weave and sing among her maids. In the bright oasis we pitched our tents, And when those three strong angels, through the heat Of the white midday came, she seethed the calf, And bore her seemly till the heavenly voice Foretold the birth of Isaac; then she laughedâ The doubtful laugh of unbelieving joy: Yet Isaac laughed upon her aged knees Whom afterward I raised my knife to slay. Then princes knew me, and in active years Life flamed so high within me that I loved The bright strong intercourse of human things: But now the unsteady fire of extreme age Is like a taper held above a cliff When the loud sea-wind moves toward the land: Now many voices and tumultuous things Sore vex my tottering thought and dimming eye. Therefore, thou Ephron and ye men of Heth, Give me for gold this many-shadowed cave, Where, when the stars come out into the heaven, And the white villages and dusky trees Send forth no sound upon the brooding night, I may sit still, and in mid-silence muse, Waiting the revelations yet unseen; For now I walk by faith, and though my eye Hath seen the sons of God, they come not now. I seek a country farther than the hills, Where is their dwelling-place, and look beyond This complex obscuration of my flesh, And see the shining of the City of God; Or else beholding all that I have lost, Her who through many, many years was mine, My heart were like Gomorrah's ghastly stones Or the blank streets of Admah. Let me rest: And with a distant gaze your youths and maids Shall softly say: There sits old Abraham Beside his dead, and there he soon will lie. 1854. THE REFUGE Let thought on thought reveal my Lord in me; Thou last, best, only, everlasting Rest, Open Thy loving arms and take me in. O do not send me unrefreshed away, Weary and bleeding from my mountain toilâ From the dark hills scared down by howling beasts, Chased by thin ghosts and doubtful phantasies; By dreadful whispers on the lonely height; By great abysses full of wavering shade; By giant footfalls of my unseen foes. To Thee, at length, my frighted spirit flies: Not all the spaces of the Universe, Whether of matter or immortal Thought, Hold any hope, or any rest, but Thee: And Thou art all things to my spacious hope: Full man unto my weak humanity; Full Godhead to my yearning deathless soul. ON A GREAT DELIVERANCE On thundered Pharaoh gaunt and fierce, With withered heart and empty hand, Whose trumpets nevermore shall pierce The silence of his stricken land. He heard the boom of ocean-foam, He heard the hum of Israel; Nor counted that his doom had come On that cloud-darkness as it fell. Their cloud becomes a glittering screen: The sea uplifts its monstrous flow; Its sands gleam white, and on, between Those stately bounds, God's people go. Cold, silent rose the glacier-wall With lilied crest impending o'er, Whence no foam-blossom dared to fall Till their last hoof had gained the shore. Ah, who could think that God would leave Them shuddering by that stormy brim, And then the incumbent waters cleave To lead them forth from Egypt dim! 1854. SORROW ON THE SEA (âThere is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.ââ Jeremiah xlix. 23) The moon-drawn Deep, sad, endless font of tears, Rests neverârests not under mildest suns, And under softest moonbeams never sleeps. She sorrowed at her birth, she sorrows still: Her eyes weep ever, and her quivering lip, Restless with sorrow, whitens round the world: Now loud, now low, now silent is her voice; But still she mourns. In mute midwinter's frost Where spiked Auroras crackle in the air, Sullen and dumb, with white unfooted snows Wrapt over her, she lies and waits till suns Of the brief summer crack the icebergs' roots, While unsealed straits explode, and breaking floes Heave on black wakening waters round the ship Whose ribs were clasped all winter in the arms Of tightening glaciers; then she swells and pants, And struggles with her weight of turbulent woe, And welters round the narwhale's wounded sides, Joining her voice to that loud-sounding horn Through which his heart's blood spouts into the air; Or moans, or thunders as the toppling spires And breaking arches of the ice temples fall. Oct. 4, 1868. BLANK VERSE Nothing more sweet than this blank rhythmic verse In which the meditative soul may pour Its endless musings. It is like a lane In the deep rural regions, where the trees Bend over rustling, casting flickering shades To cool the way, and wandering up and down In its mild confines, over hill and dale It leads by many a gray, milk-scented farm, Admitting glimpses of its drowsy peace. Now past the windy, open, heathland goes, Where lapwings limp, and curlews wheeling cry, Or where the brimming corn hangs grand and brown, Speaking of solemn harvests soon to be, And from some sudden hilltop catching sight Of rolling woods, or champaign glittering wide:â Thus on, and on, through all things winds the verse, Unfettered by perplexities of rhyme, Or too prosaic reason. Nought more sweet! Come then, dear English muse, whoe'er thou art, Come like a mild, dear daughter of the land, The land and language that I always love. Come like an English matron, pure and bright, Or like an English maiden, frank and fair; Come with the honeysuckle breath of eve; Come with the simple wild-rose flush of morn; Come with no Greek pretensionâRussian coldâ Or Persian fever. Come just as thou art, Clasped by the loving Present; teach to me The long, mellifluous, voluntary lay, Unvexed by hard necessities of sound, Yet always sensibly subordinate To one clear music and unshackled law. THE PAINTER AND THE POET For love of beauty, not applause, The painter in his note-book draws A daisy or a thistle: Some plumy, perishable thing Beneath gray hedgerows sheltering, While March winds rush and whistle. So by his light and loving line, Where rapid strength and beauty twine, He makes a weed immortal, Draws forth its soul, transformed by thought, And leaves the weed, a thing of nought, To perish on mind's portal. Even so the innate poet's eye Sees comedy and tragedy, Stern ode or carol soothing, Where other folks see none, and he Stamps beauty and eternity On nought or next to nothing. Sept. 15, 1869. AN EVENING LANDSCAPE The heavy thunderous clouds trail through the sky With shattered edges, and a smoking shower, That sends the labourer from the open field To shed or barn, spins in the curling dust And passes, drawing forth wide freshening smells From holt and orchard; while the sun, blood-red, Sinks in the wet horizon, through long rifts Of cold, blue cloud and hazy woods, to rest. Cuckoo to cuckoo calls from field to field, And half-grown geese with guttural sibilance Lie waiting to be housed. The thrushes' song Gurgles within the quaint old apple-trees. Over yon yellow patch of turnip bloom Stands the white windmill with its resting sail. The lapwing cries among the tender corn, And mocks the querulous bleat of tottering lambs Heard through the hedges. The white nettle-flower And the light kex look whiter in the dusk. The fern-owl twists its note in neighbouring field. Small night moths have begun their wanderings, And cross the course of humming cockchafers. And the late robin at the willow's top Pipes to its fellow on the poplar bough; While mellow thunders, crushing far away The gathering night-clouds, reach us faintly borne. And now the hearts of men are stirred with prayer, The pensive mother lays her babe to rest, And while the shadowy stillness deepens o'er The walks and plets seen through the open pane, Deep wishes crowd upon her, wondering hopes, Fond recollections, softly trembling fears, In this hour's pause from labour; and her heart, Tossing awhile in its own deeps, looks up And sees a chasm opening into heaven, With one high star that glitters on her soul. Sweet, holy influences descend like dew, And draw forth incense from her kindling thought; Her cares are hushed, her spirit talks with God, And, in His heavenly place, with Christ she sits. THE ROTIFER When, out in midnight's huge expanse, Our gazing orbits stop On galaxies in braided danceâ The Sea becomes a drop. But when, to microscopic ken, Life's lessening gulfs lie free, The inverted wonder turns, and then The drop becomes a Sea! And look! the tideless, shoreless deep, Translucent to the eye, Is charged with vital shapes that keep All forms of monarchy. Behemoth of the small abyss, With ribs of glass-like steelâ The force which makes the kingdom his, Turns his colossal wheel. And down a shining vortex slide His helpless myriad prey, Who gathered life from depths that hide, Where none could search but they. And yet, who knows? even there the scale Of downward life begins, Where less leviathans prevail, And lesser prey-wheel spins. O what is great and what is small, And what the solemn bound Of great and little, where the all, The last of life is found? To Thee, the ONEâthe Infiniteâ Is neither large nor lessâ Where thundering sun-stars sweep and light The chasms of nothingness. Or where, enclosed in globe on globe, The lessening less descends, Majestic Being drops her robe, And Life's last throbbing ends. Great God! whose day's a thousand years, Whose thousand years a day, Pity the doubts, forgive the fears Which vex me on my way! Why should I fear, who, wondering, see Those deeps too small to view? The Power that made such life to be, Makes life to feed it, too. Remembered sparrows, numbered hairs, Clothed lilies, ravens fed, Enfranchised spiritsâours and theirs, The Living and the Dead. Vast spheres of lifeâdim shades of deathâ To-day and yesterdayâ The vault aboveâthe void beneathâ Hark what their voices say:â âNo room for fear, no place for care That single eye can see, Opened by faith and purged by prayer, And turned and fixed on THEE.â July 1868. AFTER READING TENNYSON'S âIN MEMORIAMâ Then came the grand cessation of the song, As of an autumn gale which long has blown, Bowing the woods and tossing all the streams; A last majestic gust that leaves the land, And passes, with deep silence close behind, Out o'er the seas, and onward to the stars. 1868. THE REST Servant, cease thy labour; Thou hast borne thy burden; Thou hast done thy task! In the violent morning, When the blast was bitter, And thy fellows sleeping, Thou wast out and doing, With thy stubborn ploughshare Riving up the hillsideâ Get thee home and rest! In the sweltering noonday, When thy mates were lying By the purling runnel In the pleasant shadow, Thou, with arm wide sweeping, And with trenchant sickle, Filledst thy broad bosom With the tossing corn. While from highest heaven To the western sea-rim Slowly wheeled the great sun, White, and fierce, and cloudless, Every blazing moment, Eager and unresting, Didst thou clasp the harvestâ Haste thee now to rest! While the west grew ruddy, And the birds were chanting Softly, softly, âCease ye, Cease your toil, ye mortals,â Stook on stook behind thee Didst thou leave to ripen; But thy arm is drooping, And thine eye is heavyâ Thou shalt work no longer: Get thee home and slumber, Get thee to thy rest! Cross the lengthening shadows Of the peaceful fir-groves, Cross the quiet churchyard, Where the mossy hillocks, With their folded daisies And their sleeping lambkins, All say, âRequiescat,â Lay thee down beside them, Till the bells chime to thee, Simple bells that tell thee, âRest thee, rest thee, rest thee,â Till they bring thee rest! While the huge moon rises, And the large white planets Wheel and glow above thee, Till the cottage tapers, Swallowed by the darkness, Leave no human symbol Underneath the sky. Sleep a dreamless slumber, For thine eye shall never See the gates of morning Lift their awful shadows, Nor the gold and amber Of the heavenly dayspring Sparkle on the heather Of the purple moorland. Thou shalt wake no more! August 1855. THE END</field>
