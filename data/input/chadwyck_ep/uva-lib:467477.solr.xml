      <field name="fulltext">OTHER POEMS AMERICANS, HAIL! Frank offspring of that all-adventuring land, Where, in the petty fray of Lexington, Thrice fifty summers down the wondrous Past, Began no less a duel than of Night And Morning, that was world-watched eight loud years, Till Morning triumphed, and the watchers knew America's soil and soul for ever free: O if you fight as well upon our side As once you fought against us, how can then This cause, which is your own and ours and Man's, Do aught but conquer? You are come to us Full of the strong wine of your Western air, Full of the marrow and the sap of life, Full of the tingle of youth and maiden valour. You come as Spring comes to the winter fields When she has hovered long betwixt âI willâ And many a coy âI will notâ; for even so You hovered, halting betwixt âYeaâ and âNayââ Then thundered âYeaâ and hurled your doubts afar. And not more beautiful upon the mountains Were ever yet the feet of him that brought Glad tidings, than your prows upon the sea. Fresh and untired, you find this host of ours Worn with the burden and stress of fight and toil: A host, though but of yesterday's begetting, Already, in blind, deaf hurricane of battle, Neither ill tried nor proven an ill match For foes that in their nursery lisped of arms: A host proud of your great copartnership, Proud of their strong new brothers in the swordâ That just, that holy, that benignant sword Whose purpose and whose goal are peace: a host Famously captained by such chiefs of war As well might seem the very topmost reach Of God's own happy art in making men. And yet, not to the heroes, fighting there On strangers' soilâor underneath it laidâ Not to the brave that face yon storms of fire, Be all the laurel, all the glory and praise! Here, too, is greatness; here are heads grown grey In council, not yet dreaming of repose; Here are the athletes of debate, and here The brains that are the lamps without whose light Armies would grope and stumble, and noblest prowess With a waste splendour dazzle a fruitless field. Here also, his hot thirst for toil unslaked, The sinews of his lithe mind unrelaxed, Is he, our Empire's leader: he who set The wheels of the machine of victory Whirring and spinning throughout all this isle, Till Britain hummed as one great mill of war: A man, no wraith or shadow; a live man, Loathed by the spectres and the counterfeits; A man as human as your Lincoln was, Not muffled up in formula and phrase, With palisaded spirit, but giving us Access and entrance to his hopes and fears, And in companionship of glorious hazard Bearing us with him, while he treads a road Built like a causeway across flaming Hell; Himself a flame of ardour and resolve, Beset by all the tempests, but unquenched, Being used to blasts, and native to the storm, And thriving on the thunder from his prime. Ours were the shame, if having such a leader We proved unworthy at last to be so led, And lowered the flag of an unshaken will, And stooped our soul to a stature and a posture Like theirs who preach a base truck with the foe; Theirs who desire not to see wickedness Caught in the noose of its own vile intent, But hunger for that evil thing, a pact With evil, nay, a bargain with this pit That vomiting all putrescence has o'erflowed On the sweet earth, a treaty with this slime; Who ask that we betray the spirit of man, Defraud the world that looked to you and us As guardians of its inward patrimony, And co-trustees of its estate of freedom. From all such grovelling counsellors, and from The craven mood that in a puissant people Were the calamity of calamities And the one desperate ill, a people itself Must be its own sole saviour. But O friends, 'Twixt whom and us the dark, cold, salt partitions Avail not now to intercept the heart, We have an enemy that amid the once Glad vineyards, orchards, and dear meads of life Hews at the root of all on earth that flowered! It flowers no more, for has not he been by? He found us drowsed and half unsentinelled, Half unaccoutred and unpanoplied, Lapt in a human trust of humankind And dreaming that himself was human too. Fatal, befooling dream! He spoke indeed With human organs, gave forth human sounds, Made human gestures, and his melodists Had fashioned heretofore high human music, None fairer and none nobler, and his poets Had thrilled the world with most perhuman song; But all his later study and care had been To rip from his own breast the human heart, And, having rid him of so vain a thing, To found upon the hideous ghastly void The edifice of his thoughts, deeds, and desires; As if upon a hollow and a want There could arise aught 'stablisht to endure. And this, this was not all! For where his heart Had suffered dread erasure, demons found Befitting residence and domicile, And made that cavern in his breast their home. Yonder they camp, thence do they sally abroad, And thither from fell foray they return. These, his foul tenants, these no arms can slay, Theirs being a monstrous immortality; But he o'erthrown, their fort and citadel Were fall'n, and lacking that secure retreat These Terrors would be terrible no more. This, then, O friends and mighty aiders, this Must be your task and ours: to level with earth That fort, that citadel, that hold itself, Where all the trooping fiends find harbourage And trysting-place, and couch and kennel, and whence In the aghasted eye of the sick day They make infernal sortie. More than this No league of Man can compass: less than this Would, for ourselves or for our woeful heirs, Be but damnation a brief while deferred, At best a little putting off of fate, At best a little miserable ease, And then the paying of all the arrears of doom, Vouched in remorseless audit; then indeed Ruin and perdition and a world undone. In that belief, you and ourselves await, With hope that cannot wholly vanquish fear, The veiled, tremendous morrow; and yonder stands Your Nation, watching o'er the sea her sons; A Nation whence, as from an orchestra Suavely controlled, there rises goldenly Though sternly, with far surge and tidal swell, Not without sad and wailful underflow, But mighty in heave of sound, all dissonance hushed, A new Heroic Symphony of war; Heard throughout Earth with a grave thankfulness By such as love great music; and perhaps Ev'n on an ear divine not wholly lost, Not utterly unacceptable to Heaven. December 1917. THE FORESIGHT OF THE BLIND The great, strange, conquering legends puissant still As in the Middle Age whence they arose, Which are they? Sovereign above all are those Of Faust's dread bargain with the Spirit of Ill, And of that Knight who, taking long his fill Of bliss with Venus, earned him longer woes! And from the Kingdom of our living foes Came both these dreams, mighty to haunt and thrill, And each the tale of a lost soul: as though Germania unawares had prophesied Of her own state and fate on Earth, that sees, Dark with self-doom, against a fiery glow, The lost soul of a nation, wandering wide Like lone Ahasuerus, without ease. February 1918. TO CERTAIN NEBULAE Planet and star, and the glory of ancient constellations, These have surfeit of homage, in songs of a thousand singers: You, O Nebulae, still, as of old, dwell yonder songless; One in Orion's sword-hilt, one in Andromeda's girdle, One like shadowy foam, where sails a fantastical Argo. You, mid Arabian cities, and proud Chaldea, and Egypt, Mighty astronomers, slowly deciphering Heaven's papyrus, Oft, no doubt, have watched, in a world all colour and fruitage, Balsam, sultry aroma, and odorous vivid abundance, Palm, oleander and cedar, acanthus and lotus and laurel, Foliage, vintage, plumage, honey and delicate unguents, Attar and spices and myrrh. And in many a nearer region Many a wandering gaze hath known your places of ambush, High above dreams, above tears! But never a golden greeting Thither ascends, through space, through coldly inhuman vastness, Out of the mouth of a poet, in magical human numbers. You, then, far across night, and immense, magnificent silence, Intricate cosmic coil, and the nodes of entangled orbits, Let me salute, O pallid, unsplendid things, amid splendour Hovering ever obscure, amid prideful lustre unprideful: You that to vague, light ken seem only as bodiless auras, Breath of a hundred stars; but rather appear unto wisdom Fringes and shreds of the Veil, through which, at the Earth's great moments, Flashes of God break forth, in the hour of the smiting of Evil; Day of the clang of the axe upon trees that bore but poison; Day of the mortal throes of iniquitous perishing empires; When, upon brows discrowned, the erasing extinguishing thunders Fall, and the throne of the cruel is tossed as a leaf in the whirlwind. November 1918. THE SCROLL OF LIFE Life seems a scroll, not so much darkly writ As ill transcribed; and he who pores on it Must, like a painful scholiast, thread perplext The thorny thicket of a mangled text. But with it wov'n is many a quoted line,â The cryptic prose breaks into verse divine; And in strange wafts the painful scholiast hears Hexameters of the Iliad of the Spheres. THE INNERMOST CAVERN The unsailed, the unentered cavern, The still ungazed upon! No light but the sea-phosphorescence Amidst its night hath shone. Then only it wakes from slumber, Whenever the visiting gleam Of the fairy fire of the Ocean Illumes its secret dream. For it dreams of space without confines, Of vastness around and above; And it waits like the heart of a maiden, That waits to be lit by love. TOIL Life is a workshop and a temple as well, Where the great toilersâso their annals tellâ To Justice, Truth, and Love paid worship, knowing Life was a workshop and a temple as well. Life is a workshop and a palace both. Nature, that ever labours without sloth, Nature herself in beauty and grace hath taught us Life is a workshop and a palace both. O be it ours, while hate and feud are rife, To keep far off from this our land the strife That yonder makes a wreck of Man's own dwelling, His wondrous workshop, temple and palace, Life.</field>
