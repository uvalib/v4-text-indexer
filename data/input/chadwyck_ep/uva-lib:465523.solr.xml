      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable, THE Lord Viscount SAY and SELE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPISTLES, PART I. EPISTLE I. King Henry the Second kept Rosamund the Daughter of the Lord Clifford as his Mistriss. His Sons having rebell'd and invaded Normandy, the King was obliged to go against 'em; and fearing the Jealousie of his Queen Elinor might be fatal to the beauteous Rosamund in his absence, he built a Labyrinth for her in Woodstock-Park, where she cou'd be safe, tho' at a little distance from the Palace. His Mistris's Letter and the King's Answer are the Argument of the two following Epistles. Rosamund to King Henry the Second. If (Mighty Henry!) Thou canst deign to see This, the last trouble thou'lt receive from me, In ev'ry word my Sorrow will appear, In ev'ry Line my Shame and my Despair. Yet by my Love, but I the Name shall stain, By our past Joys, and by my future Pain, Think, I conjure thee, of my helpless State, And if for Love you cannot, read for Hate. Here thou may'st triumph or'e a vanquisht Maid, And glory in the Ruins thou hast made; Here feast thy Eyes, and in this hateful Scroul Behold the sad Resemblance of my Soul. My Virgin Soul, which er'e 'twas stain'd by thee Was white, like this, er'e sully'd thus by me. My Thought, My Wish, of all Offence were clear And the whole Volume of my Life was fair, Till thy rude Hands the beauteous Page defil'd, And left me, like this blotted Paper, soil'd. What by this Conquest cou'dst thou hope to win? The Spoil, alas! is yours, and yours the Sin. Why on my Name this Scandal did'st thou bring? Why with thy Deeds must my Dishonour ring? Fame never meddles with the mean and poor, The more our Greatness is, our Fault's the more. A Light wou'd little on the Ground appear, Which mounted in the Air wou'd seem a Star. Why on my Sexes Weakness did'st thou play, And make my Honour to thy Lust a Prey? How dearly have you bought the lawless Bliss? Your Infamy and Mine are both the Price. Yet my Soul ne'r consented to this Ill, Nor was I once transported by my Will; For tho' by Force my Body has been thine, Heav'n knows I never would my Heart resign. Had I an Object worthy of me seen, My Lover youthful like my Love had been. True Love is simple like his Mother Truth, Love only kindly when 'tis Youth with Youth: Nothing more odious to our blooming Years Than the white Frost of winter-blasted Hairs. The Reins of Time no Sov'reign Pow'r can hold, Swift is his Course, and Monarchs must be Old Tho' Honour our ambitious Sex may please, Age ev'n in Honour is a foul Disease. This Nature deals and Death alike to all, And Kings and Men are equal in their Fall. This to the World will aggravate my Shame, They'll say, she sold her yet untainted Fame; Gold was the Fuel to her wanton Fire, What Charm has Age to kindle young Desire? No; the curst Woman whom thy Presents won Was the vile Cause that I was thus undone. The Circe she by whose Enchantment charm'd A Monster I became, by Guilt transform'd: A Wretch, the base Betrayer of her Kind, Plague of my Peace and Poyson of my Mind. May Want and Sickness be on Earth her Doom, And Torment endless in the Life to come. Say, Henry, how can I be dear to thee, When thou so odious art become to me? My hapless Name with thine I lately found Cut deeply in the Glass, a guilty Wound! Fain from its place I would the Glass remove, But fear the Air will then betray my Love. Again I fain wou'd wash it out with Tears, And still more eminent thy Name appears: To cover it, in vain, my Hand I laid, The Diamond witnesses to what it made. Thus Conscience with repeated Terrors stings; But Conscience is a Womans Dream to Kings. Time wears out other Griefs and dries our Tears, And Shame alone increases with our Years. Oft for Diversion in our Towr's I ly To see, in private, such as travel by; Those spy me thro' the Walls and curse my Sin, The Walls, methinks, confess the Wretch within: The Matrons rail at my abandon'd Life, To wrong the fairest Queen and chastest Wife; The Maids already wish me in my Tomb, And scarce have Patience till my Hour is come; As from Infection they my Dwelling sly, And think the Fields polluted which are nigh. Well did you know a Monster I shou'd be, When first this Labyrinth was built for me; Whose dark Mæanders, as they various wind, Are the true Image of my wandring Mind. The Clew that leads me out, conducts me in, And in a Circle thus I walk in Sin. My Woman in your Gallery I met, Around with Beauties and with Heroes set; Of the fair Pictures that were hanging by Lucretia dying seiz'd her wondring Eye. Ah! who (she curious askt) so Young and Fair Commits this latest Action of Despair? A Roman Lady (I reply'd in hast) Her Name, which scarce I cou'd pronounce, was Chast; So like her Story and unlike my own, I blush'd to tell it out, and wish'd it done. Of my own Weakness, and her Wit afraid, I soon dismiss'd the too-enquiring Maid. In this it only differs from Lucrece, My Wrong's as famous, but my Courage less. My Vertue forc'd that had been often try'd, Like her I suffer'd and shou'd thus have dy'd, By Fear provok'd, or by the Virgins Rage, The Lily in her Cheeks and Rose engage: By turns they both the beauteous Field possess, And now the Red is more, and now 'tis less. Thus in my Bosom diff'rent Passions move, Love yields to Guilt, and often Guilt to Love. Again Remorse usurps her Tyrant-Reign, And tho I dream of Ease, I wake in Pain. When the Sun hastning to the Western Main Lengthens the Shadows and imbrowns the Plain, Oft by a neighb'ring Rivulet I stand Which wanders thro' our Meads on Golden Sand: There in the Crystal Stream I throw my Bait, The Fish are jealous of the fair Deceit; At Distance on the proffer'd Feast they look, Play near the Line, yet still avoid the Hook; Senseless themselves, by Nature they are taught, They catch if they but touch, and dye if caught. By Nature much, by Reason more secur'd, I soon was tempted, and thy Bait devour'd. My Name that once was honest to the Ear, None but the Wicked and Unchast will bear. The Glories of our House no more will shine, No more the Ancient Honours of our Line; Clifford no more a spotless Fame can boast, In me their Vertue and their Pride are lost: My Kindred Blood they will disown with Scorn, And urge I was a spurious Issue born: Pure from their Spring the purple Current came, Till I polluted first the generous Stream. Amid my Garden wrought by artful Hands Diana naked in a Fountain stands; The quiver'd Goddess troops of Nymphs surround, Defend the sight, and guard the hallow'd Ground. As where Acteon once in Ambush laid, With impious Eyes survey'd th' Immortal Maid, For this he dy'd, for this his Hounds pursue The Hunter, Stag, and him that fed 'em slew. From my own Thoughts I thus attempt to fly By them I'm still pursu'd, and of their Wounds shall die. When in our Lawns the Dew I gently sweep, The Flow'rs, the tender Herb, I fancy, weep: Each Sigh of Wind I hear, each Drop I see, Thus Guilt deceives me, is, I think, for me. I find no Help, no Hope, where'r I go, But Scenes of new Despair and constant Woe, In the fair Cabinet of wondrous Cost Thy treach'rous Gift e'r I my Honour lost. Amymone was wrought, a harmless Maid, By Neptune, an adult'rous God, betray'd, Who prostrate at his Feet implores in vain, With lifted Hands, the Tyrant of the Main. The God was blind, like Henry, to her Tears, Deaf to her Sighs, and heedless of her Pray'rs: My Fate in hers was eminently shown, I see the Meaning now, but am undone. Here too (alas! too late I see it now) The Love of Jove chang'd Io to a Cow; With Argus hundred Eyes the Fair was kept, Who always wak'd with some, and scarce with others slept: Thus watch'd by sovereign Juno's high Decree; And Elinor's as wise, as fierce as she. In this, my future Ills I might have seen, And still been guiltless to thy injur'd Queen. In this thou well hast imitated Jove, Since to a Beast thou hast transform'd thy Love, Worse far than any of the forked Kind; A Monster both in Body and in Mind. My sickly Tapers give a doubtful Light, Burn dim in Clouds of Mist, and mock my Sight, As if my Breath was poys'nous to the Flame, And Light fled from me as it flies from Shame: The dreadful Minute then I call to Mind, When with blue Rays the dying Tapers shin'd, As at the presence of a rising Ghost, When the dear Treasure of my Youth I lost. If thro' the Glass the Stars by chance appear, I dread their Silver Beams, and shrink with Fear, Since all this Horror then to thee belongs, Take, Take my Life, and rid me of my Wrongs: A Plot contrive that I by Law may bleed, Lay Treason to my Charge, I'll own the Deed, My Life's a Blemish to thy Glorious Name, My Death again will make thee dear to Fame. In mercy, Henry, hear my latest Pray'r, View my Distress, and pity my Despair. This truest Act of Friendship let me prove, As I've been always faithful in my Love. King Henry II. to Rosamund. What Message wou'd most welcome be to thee, Such was thy Letter, such thy Friend to me. Such Pleasure, when I heard thy Name, I found, And eccho'd thro' the Camp the joyful Sound, How is it with my Rosamund, I cry'd? Again I askt, the Man again reply'd. Yet still to ask him I had something new, Still fond of knowing more, the more I knew. How fares it with my Mistress, quickly tell, Say, is she living, is she safe and well? The Seal, impatient of Delay, I tore, And read with Tears the doubtful Pages or'e: Nor cou'd I there thy Meaning oft perceive, Or, if I ought to joy, or if to grieve. So much thy Love was mingled with Despair, It less increas'd my Quiet than my Care. What Reason has my Rosamund to mourn, Or what to wish for, but her Lords return? Tho' neither Me, nor my Return she wants, Why else this Anger, these unkind Complaints? Why is my Passion and my Service blam'd, And why am I with Sighs and Sorrow nam'd? Is this the Comfort I must hope to find, Is Love become the Burthen of her Mind? How can she wrong what all esteem so Fair, Or what we see so Bright to Blots compare? Whose Beauties in such full Perfections shine, The Morn might veil her Orient Face at thin Enough of other Troubles I have known, As well to win as to defend the Throne: Enough been punish'd by domestick Strife; In Sons rebellious and a jealous Wife: Ev'n now against their Father they declare, And urge my People to dishonest War: While forein Laurels crown my ancient Brows, They raze my Palaces and waste my House. Against me Rome seditious Libels spreads, And thunders Curses on my Subjects Heads. A Son ingrate revolted from his Sire Invades the Norman Lands with Sword and Fire. Expos'd to Dangers thus where-e'r I come, Attack'd by Foes abroad, betray'd at home, Old Age and Jealousie, the Vice of Years, This sinks my Mind, and that my Body wears. Despairing of Relief in my Distress, Since those increase it who shou'd make it less; No Beam of Joy but in my Love I see, No Pleasure in my mighty Griefs but thee. In thee I taste the soft Delights of Peace, And, rack'd with Pain and Sorrow, dream of Ease: This only Blessing why should they refuse, Or I the Privilege of Subjects lose? The meanest Wretch is in his Lass allow'd, Nor Love forbidden to the servile Crowd. The Peasant, when his daily Task is done, Hugs his brown Nymph, and thinks the World his own. Hard Fate! If Kings Prerogative destroys Their Right to Love which every Slave enjoys: Hard, if they must their Peoples Burthens bear, And not their Portion of their Pleasures share. Let my Son war, and let the Realms rebel, Let Rome condemn me to the Depths of Hell; Let me be curs'd, abandon'd, and exil'd, By such, as once ador'd me, be revil'd; Let Elinor rage, yet while my Love is safe, I'll scorn their Pow'r, and at their Fury laugh. I fear no Ill while Rosamund is mine, Nor at the worst of Fortune will repine. Fortune is hers and on her Eyes she waits, And what she pleases to decree is Fate's. Were I grown feeble, were my Wishes cold, Did my Heart fail me, thou might'st think me Old; With ease I manage still the prancing Steed, And the fierce Squadrons to the Combat lead; By Night I sleep contented on the Ground, I start at no Fatigue and fear no Wound; Nor Heats nor Colds my supple Joints can wrong, And I'm, in all things, but Remembrance, Young. Yet had my Age confin'd me to my Bed, Had Care and Sickness sunk my drooping Head, So pow'rful are thy Charms, so sweet thy Strains, 'Twould fill with active Blood my wither'd Veins: Nor need'st thou like Medea search the Meads, The Mountains and the Woods for Magick Weeds: Her poys'nous Simples mixt with human Gore And Serpents Seed did Æson's Youth restore: A Word from thee to animate excels Her Drugs, her Philters, and Infernal Spells; A Glance of thine wou'd in an Hour restore What numerous Winters had destroy'd before. My pondrous Arms with Pleasure still I bear And wave the dreadful Sword and massy Spear; So much thy looks our vital Spirits chear As the Earth smiles at the returning Year. When with new force the Sun his Beams displays. And Nature pregnates with the Genial rays; On the green Boughs, the Birds their Spousals sing, And Winter flies before the rising Spring Again, the Flow'rs the painted Field adorn The Loves, the Graces, and the Smiles return. Thus from thy Eyes, new Vigour we receive Grow, Young and Gay, and other Ages live. Who thinks of thee, can know no other Care, No Grief disturb his Breast, if thou art there; No Toil, no Danger can his Courage daunt, He flourishes in War and thrives in Want. No more the Guiltless for the Guilty blame, Mine was the Sin, and mine must be the Shame. Yet who so rashly wou'd the Fault reprove, Who think, 'tis shameful for a King to love? It's Virgin-Purity thy Soul retains. It loses nothing, tho thy Lover gains. We judge his Actions by thy Mans intent. None can offend without their own Consent. And when a Prince commands you to comply, 'Tis less a Sin to grant than to deny. Is my Name odious, I'll my Name forget, And hate the King, if thou the King dost hate. Tho Henry once was no ungrateful sound, Nor did it when 'twas oft repeated, wound. But since 't has lost its Musick and its Grace, Let your Pen blot it, and your Fingers rase. When from thy Tow'rs the Passengers afar Behold my Mistress shining like a Star. Why shou'dst thou fancy, they look up in Spite, Or call that Malice which is their Delight. They gaze with Rapture and with Wonder see Another Sun, another Heaven in thee. The Crystal stream which thro' the Meadow glides With pleasure finds thee by his Flowry sides; He swells his little Waves in wanton play, And fain to view thee in his course wou'd stay. Fain wou'd he kiss thy lovely Feet and tries, In vain to touch thee, and departing sighs. He murmurs at the Channsel which contains His wandring Current, and in Tears complains. The Fish by nature of the Bait beware, Yet leap at thine, and think no danger there. They see thy Image in the silver Brook, And dazled with thy Beauty catch the Hook. As on the Bank thou sitst, the trembling Deer Dance sportive round thee and forget to fear. Thee, the bright Nymph by whom the tuneful throng Shall paint their Goddesses, and grace their Song. Thee, the kind Theme which future Bards shall choose, To be at once their Subject and their Muse. Thy Name shall be the Musick of their Groves, Their Virgins in thy Name shall tell their Loves. Thee shall the Chanters of the Forrest sing, By Eccho taught to welcome in the Spring. The Infant hanging on his Mothers Breast, Shall at thy Name be husht and lull'd to rest, For such as in thy kind excell thy Name, Shall hence be Glorious, and to wear it fame Where e're you tread, the springing Flo'wrs appear. And with their od'rous Breath perfume the Air; 'Tis their own loss, and not your fault they moan That you no sooner touch 'em, but are gone, The Weeds most noxious, if they kiss your Feet Lose their Infection, and from thence are sweet. Did Jove or Neptune, whom they lov'd deceive, And whom enjoy'd, to ruin others leave? Were I O, or Amimone like thee, Shou'dst thou compare the Perjur'd Gods to me? Were whom they ruin'd, like my Mistress Fair, Or like her Lover, were the Gods sincere? Fear not the Queen. Be in thy Bour secure. For only Vaughan knows the secret Door. If Elnors Argus has an hundred Eyes, Mine has a thousand to defend his Prize. Had she the Malice of the Wife of Jove Had she her Pow'r, yet I wou'd save my Love. Who, in my absence will to hurt thee dare, Whom the King loves, and who's a Monarchs care. Why art unwilling that the Stars shou'd shine, Why hate the brightness, which resembles thine? Oh when I meditate on past Delights And the high Raptures of our blissful Nights, When the whole Beauty I at once Survey'd And saw the Blushes of the yeilding Maid. I bless their paler Glories, and can pay, No future Worship to the Hateful day. And now the Trumpet sounding from afar, Proclaims the Signal of approaching War. The Squadrons shouting thro' the Camp I hear And Rosamund repeated, Rends the Air. Amid the hotest of the Fight I feel Thy Grief more peircing than the pointed Steel. My care of thee, my other cares destroys And Vict'ry yeids to more delicious Joyes. For Conquest is not to my Heart so dear Nor to my Eyes in all her Pomp so fair. Woodstock, the Garden of the fruitful West, Be blest in her, in whom the King is blest. Nor Roman Villa, nor Companian Field Cou'd more delight, nor richer Prospects yield. For thee, I Pardon her ungrateful Race, The shame of Oxford, and the Realms disgrace. Poor in their Fortunes, in their Morals loose, And false and hated, as the scattred Jews. Had these been tempted, as the Jews were try'd Their God had been betray'd, and here had dy'd. Dull, Proud, Deceitful, Ignorant and Base, A wicked People in a lovely Place. Oft in her silent unfrequented Groves, My Rosamund, and I have told our Loves. Oft on her little Hills have chac'd the Faun. And walkt in Evening shade the flowry Lawn. Beneath a spreading Oak we oft wou'd lie, And see the little River wander by. Thou my fair Nymph, and I thy amorous Swain, Thus happy then we liv'd, and thus may live again. Tho' by hard Fate, my Body still is here, My Soul with thee, my better part is there. EPISTLE II. King John having for a long time Courted the Fair Matilda, Daughter to the Lord Fitzwater, and she still refusing to listen to his unlawful Love; he banishes her Father and Friends, persecutes her Family, and she flies for Safety to a Nunnery in Essex, at Dunmow; where she takes the Veil: And the King writes to her, and invites her to Court. What Success his Letter met with, may be seen in her Answer. King John to Matilda. Start not, my fair, when you my Letters view, There's nothing in 'em feignd, and nothing new. What different ways to win thee I have try'd? How often woo'd, and been as oft deny'd? To thee as to a Goddess I have pray'd, And constant Worship at thy Altars paid. But thou wert deaf, and ne're wouldst Deign to hear A Monarch's Vows, nor listen to his Pray'r. My Arts have been in vain, in vain my Sighs, These cou'd not move thee, nor cou'd those surprize. Oft have my Eyes confest my Am'rous Pain, And meeting thine, they ever met Disdain. Yet, fond of Ruin, still I gaze on thine, Nor dread the pointed Rays they dart at mine. We blush'd, and sigh'd, but different Passions prove, You sigh'd and blush'd for Hate, as I for Love. When my Tongue fail'd, my Tears their Want supply'd, And when I cou'd nor weep, nor speak, I Sigh'd. This, tho' you always shun it, you must see, And sure wou'd pity any Wretch but Me. To love condemn'd, to wish and to despair, 'Tis a King's Fate, and well is worth your Care. A Thousand Beauties, in thy Face I see, A Thousand Graces, only found in thee. My Fancy to distinguish 'em perplext, This minute this prefers, and that the next. Both in another Excellence I loose, And where 'tis all Perfection cannot Choose. Thy Eyes, while I behold their awful Rays, Command superior to the rest my Praise. With Force unequal they dispute the Sway, Whom, as we yield to Tyrants, we obey. Thy Cheeks to tempt my Wandring Glance expose The Smiles, the Lily, and the blushing Rose. Thy Lips, that rising to my Kisses, swell, Wou'd every Grace, if I might kiss, excell. My Judgment's by their balmy Sweets betray'd, And as thy Eyes commanded, they persuade. Greedy of gazing, I Increase desire, As often as I look, I fan the raging Fire: As often as I view thy shining Hair, The Brown, methinks, is better than the Fair. So Beautiful, in Thee, the Black appears, Thy rowling Eyes seem brighter than the Stars. Nor Snow, nor Ivory, nor Cygnets Down Can with thy Teeth compare, no Whiteness with thy own. Where e're on thee our ravish'd Eyes we move, 'Tis Charming all, Astonishment and Love. In Nature there is nothing can dispence So many Sweets to Pleasure ev'ry Sense, On Thee, these Wonders are but ill bestow'd, Which only humble Us, and make thee Proud. In vain was Nature at this mighty Cost, Her Treasure's are on thee, Ungrateful, lost. Such Beauty was not for a Cell design'd Nor wer't thou made so fair to be confin'd. When Old and Ugly, Heav'n your Sex allows To cover our Contempt with solemn Vows The Young, the Fair, We better can employ To bless the World, and give her Masters Joy. Curst be The Priests, who wou'd our Nymphs immure, To have 'em to themselves the more secure! Unhappy Those, who on their Zeal depend; Devotion's their Pretence, but Lust their End. Happy the Ages, when the Saints were kind, And Godly Men, with Godly Women joyn'd. No Superstition did their Joys molest; They saw, they lik'd, and, if they cou'd, possest. 'Twas thus they did their sacred Hours improve, And all their boasted Charity was Love. The Priests were then contented with their share, And late pretended to engross the Fair. Meek then and poor, they to their Faith were just, None dreaded then their Pow'r, nor fear'd their Lust: Now, they our Daughters, and our Lands possess, And, as their Wealth, their Vices too increase. Where're they aim to conquer, they prevail, And every sordid Monk has his Serrail. For this what Monarch wou'd not quit his Crown, And lay the weighty Load of Empire down, In Plenty, Luxury, and Ease to live, And riot on the Alms which Sinners give. Hence—with these Signs of Royalty and Pow'r, The Globe, the Scepter shall be mine no more; Matilda to the Cloyster I'll pursue, Prevent her Vows, or be a Vot'ry too. To her I'll still address my earnest Pray'r, Nor kneel to any other Saint, but her. Wait on her Mattin and her Evening Song, The most officious of the pious Throng. My fervent Zeal may melt her frozen Breast, And she may loath the King, yet like the Priest. Your Holy Meaning I perhaps mistake, To think you leave us, for your Lovers sake, To know how for to serve you I wou'd go, Or what my Passion wou'd, to gain you, do. Yet this I fondly fancy you have done, And but to try me, wou'd profess a Nun. That Thou, my Beauteous Sister, may'st confine Thy Brother to thy self, for ever thine: That thus, unenvy'd Pleasures we may tast And thou, by being only mine, be chast: Such are Lovers, if they constant prove, And Women never sin, unless they Rove. The rest is pardon'd, as the Sex is Frail, Or else Ye Powers! Have mercy on the Vail. For oft the jolly Monk with Holy Leer, Disturbs the Virgin, and confounds her Pray'r. Declares his wish in his Lascivious look And Ogles more the Sisters than his Book. If for their Sins they absolution gain, 'Tis on Condition, they shall Sin again. All creatures were Created with desire, And but to charm the Fair, we to be great aspire. Of these, who most to Innocence pretend, We fear, what e're they promise, most Offend. Such houses by our Fathers were design'd, Not for the best, and Fairest of their kind. But as their Hospitals, at first were made To nurse the Poor, the Sickly and Decay'd. So here the Old, the Crooked, and the Lame, To these shou'd be remov'd, to hide their shame. If the wise Author of the Realms of light Had meant to keep his Wonders from our sight. The golden Sun had ne're adorn'd the Spheres, Nor Night been Painted with the shineing Stars. A horrid Darkness, then had been our Doom, And Man still wander'd in a frightful Gloom. Feinds are Imprison'd in the burning Deep, In Holes and Caves, the noxious Vermin creep. While purest things Illustrious appear And what's most eminent, is still most fair. Our Mother earth, a mournful Widow lives Impatient of her absent Lord, she grieves And life from the returning Sun receives. Her bridal Robes, in Triumph then she wears, Fogets her winter Sighs and fruitless Tears. With open Arms, the lusty Bridegroom meets The Woods, the Winds, diffuse their Vernal Sweets. And Philomel, again her Notes repeats. The Forrest Oak erects, his lofty Head The Nymphs, the Shepherds, on the flowry Mead With Songs and Dances, bless the Genial Bed. This, cruel Hypocrite! you oft have seen, And well you know the Mystick sense, and what their Frolicks mean. Faithful and Chast, you see the cooing Dove, Bill by her Mate, and Tempt him on to Love. The Phænix, said by fame to be but one, May boast her Chastity, because alone. A different Sex had Nature made 'em Two You'd hear they Love, as much as others do. The flames, in which 'tis Fabled, she expires, Are her vain Wishes, and her hot Desires. Thus may all suffer, who affect to Hate, The Joys of loving, and be this their Fate To covet to possess 'em, when too late. Was there but one, of all thy Sex so young, So fair as thou, who cou'd resist so long. 'Twou'd then convince me, I have been to blame, And Womans Virtue's something more than Name. The glories of a Court, if thou hadst seen, What 'tis to be, or to be like a Queen. What more cou'd charm Thee, than to hear the Great, Adore thy Beauty and admire thy Wit! The Pomp, the Splendour of a Princes Train, All that can please the Youthful and the Vain. States-men and Heroes, kneeling at thy Shrine, And thy least Title, then wou'd be divine. Is not this better than a loathsom Cell, Than Penance, Vespers, or the Morning Bell? To this Insensible thou must Confess, 'Tis want of Knowledge, makes thee think it less. As such who have been coursly Bred, prefer, To the Court delicates, their homely Fare. No more, Matilda! by thy Pride abus'd, Let the King Woo, to be again refus'd. Pitty thy Self, thy Kindred, and thy Friends, For all their Happiness, on thine depends. The Ills, thy Cruelty have caus'd Deplore. Thy Friends, thy Father to his House Restore, None can my anger, like thy Pride condemn, 'Twas love to Thee, and not my Hate to them. On thee with Justice, they'll their Curses shou'r, Their Honours and their Lives, are in thy Pow'r For a Court leave the Cloyster and the Grate, A Prince attends thee, and a better Fate. At the blest change, thou wilt not long Repine, For all that I can give Thee, shall be thine. Matilda to King John. As Criminals condemn'd, the Warrant dread Which brings their Fate, so I your Letter read. Nor askt from whom the hated Message came But guest the Business, e're I saw your Name. With Horror, I beheld the guilty Page, And every Line I read, I blush'd with Rage. You work your rich Invention to contrive, New ways, new Plagues, to make me hate to Live? Absence, the best defence against Desire, E're this I hop'd wou'd quench your lawless Fire. For rarely such a Passion, long endures, Or Vertue daunts it, or Oblivion cures. But what we covet most, we seldom get. And what endeavour to avoid, we meet. Your Paper blotted by your sin appear'd, Which had I not dispis'd, I shou'd have fear'd. A just Resentment, urg'd me to proceed, Nor then resolv'd to Answer what I Read. Tho' Writing, may your Future hopes prevent, And Silence be mis-taken for Consent; Besides, 'tis Natural for this Desease, If suffer'd or neglected to Encrease. Our Sex, no Flattery in this shou'd use, But what is askt with Shame, with Pride refuse. This to inform you, I attempt to Write, What Fear, Resentment, and disdain Indite. By Passion conquer'd, if the Stile is course, Your Letter merits, cou'd I write it worse. What shall I say, that may my Wrongs contain, I can to none, but you and Heav'n, complain? My Words I find will never reach my Sense, And my Cause suffer by my weak Defence. To whom shall I Address for help below, My Sov'reign is my Judge, my Judge, my Foe. Ev'n now while pleading at his Bar I stand, Confusion seizes both my Heart and Hand. I dread his Smiles, I tremble at his Frown, And Kind or Cruel, am alike undone. I Raze, I Write, and fear the dubious Page, Is fram'd too softly to express my Rage? I mourn, I rave, and in this changeful State, Have nothing certain in my Soul, but Hate. Distracted by my Sorrow, if you find, A tender Word, 'tis what I ne're design'd. 'Tis the meer weakness of your sick Conceit, Which makes my little Beauty seem so great? Things are thus alter'd in a troubled Stream, If Crooked strait, if strait they Crooked seem; Thus fancy the dissembled Object showes, And Judgment is deceiv'd in what it knowes. As in a Mirrour, if the Glass is true, Such as your real likeness, such are you; But if you change your Form, it changes there, And shewes you as you are, not as you were. Like you the Shade reflected seems to move, If frowns or smiles, like you, and such is Love. What Man's so vain to fancy he may find, A Body perfect, or a perfect Mind? Observe the Beauty, nicely or the Saint, And both will something of Perfection want. 'Tis a known truth, that Beauty like the Will, In all is various and Imperfect Still. A little diff'rence will the likeness change, And make the most familiar Features strange. Compare two Faces, and you'll find with ease, In this what pleases, do's in that displease? What Maid of such disputed Charms wou'd boast So late Discover'd and so quickly Lost, Who wou'd be proud of an uncertain Grace, Which makes one fair, and spoils another Face. How can this Madness o're your Sex prevail, To doat on what's as doubtful as tis Frail. When Glory calls for all your Youthful fire, To wast it in Fruihon or Desire; To languish at our Feet, Lament and Sigh, To Pine, to Sicken, and perhaps to Die. Those who the Damsells cruelty survive, To look like Sots, and scarce be said to live? Was Man created Lord of all for this, To work, and in our Ruin place his Bliss. You Tempt, and Truth eternal Falcely swear, You promise mighty things, but pay in Air. If with your wicked Will, I cou'd comply Your Self wou'd soon repent as well as I? Grown weary by Possession, you'd begin, To loath my weakness, and abhor the Sin. Then nor your Riches, nor your Sovereign Pow'r My Virgin Peace, nor Honour cou'd restore. By you, my Father and my Friends are sent, To Prison, and unworthy Panishment. Whom to my Heart are dearest, you remove, My Friends, My Father, yet pretend to love. A Virgin Widow, I by you am made, A helpless Orphan e're my Father's dead. Your Lust unbridled has these Ills produc'd, And now you pitty those you have abus'd. A Feign'd concern for what is past, you shew And yet, we all to your injustice owe. Thus the sly Monsters of the Wood beguile, Their headless Prey, and while they kill 'em smile. The Basilisk, with Poyson'd glances kills, The Crocodile her fraudful Tears distills. Unwary Passengers, they thus decoy, And fawn on those, they purpose to destroy? Thus cover'd with the Rose, the Serpent stings, And from the Rock, the tempting Mermaid sings. But by misfortune, and Experience wise, I know your Cunning, and your Arts despise. How cou'd Sicilian Tyrants Torture more, Again to wound me, whom you Rack'd before. I better cou'd my Fathers Wrongs endure, And my Friends trouble, were my Peace secure? If you to Persecute me, wou'd forbear, Or I had nothing, from your Lust to fear. If Love's your Passion, your Address is strange, Love works with Tenderness, and not Revenge. All mild and gentle, 't has been still describ'd. Nor shou'd our Sex be threaten'd, but be Brib'd If Pray'rs, Rewards, and constant Service fail, Severity and Threats, will ne're prevail? Oh! With what glory do's that Monarch Reign, Whose Fame, no Vices, nor Jnjustice stain How happy are his Subjects in his sway. With Zeal they love him, and with Pride obey. Here to be safe, from your Assaults I flew, But cannot fly, as fast as you persue. Where shall a Maid, to be secure, Retreat, Since thus reclus'd, my Danger is as great? If from you Suit, I must be never free, The Court and Cloyster, are alike to Me. Nor Bolts, nor Grates, a Monarch can exclude, When Tyranny and Lust, enflame his Blood. Poets with utmost Eloquence have strove, To hide the Guilt, and shew the charms of Love. The Lewd, the Wanton, are enroll'd by Fame, She paints their Beauties, and she hides their Shame. The Muses sung, the Fountains wept for these, And Thracian Orphus, drew the dancing Trees. The finest Colours on their Sins they plac'd, Which they ne'er nam'd, or if they nam'd 'em Grac'd? So kind the Muses, to their Sex have been, That hardly Incest was allow'd a Sin: The worst were punish'd in their Fables least They change their Forms, but ever for the best. Myrrha, tho' teeming with Incestuous love, To Myrrh is chang'd, and now Perfumes the Grove. Byblis at once, a Son and Brother bears, Yet all her Pennance are her Chrystal Tears. Sylla, who Flies about with painted Wings For the same Treason in the Forrest sings. Another and a better Form she wears. Some now are Goddesses, and some are Stars. The Vertuous are among the worthless plac'd, As if 'twere then, a scandal to be Chast. The Virgin ever was the Poets fool, An Awkard thing, insensible and dull. The Lash of Satyr, she has always born, Or never nam'd, or never, but with Scorn. The Face which you pretend so much to Praise, Wou'd more your Pitty, than your wonder raise. My Beauty little at the best is past, By Grief 'tis Wrinkled, or by time defac'd. It suits with the Condition, I have sworn, And what you valu'd once, you now wou'd scorn. The World Renounc'd, shall be my care no more, I loath its Pleasures, and its Pride abhor. My Vail to all its Splendours, I prefer, Heav'n is my aim, and all my hopes are there. If thus, unhappy Rosamund had done, Kept to her Vow, and liv'd like me a Nun. With glory she had dy'd, as she had liv'd, And Age had ended, what Revenge contriv'd. From Guilt and Fear, she had alike been free, And loath'd the Sin, as you are loath'd by Me. Her Fame had been as spotless as her Face, Her Life in Innocence, her Death in Peace. To hide the shame is in the Pow'r of Kings, But who can give us ease, when Conscience Stings? That Judge severely do's our Faults reprove, And Witnesses of all to Him above. If my old Father, bending to the Grave, By shameful Exile, wou'd my Honour save. While, and Content, he sees his Towns destroy'd His Foes possessing what he late enjoy'd? Shall I despise his Lessons, and disgrace, His own great Actions, and his noble Race? Shall the rich Treausure, which so much has cost, Be so soon Lavish'd, and so lighty lost. No—His last Words too deep Impression made, Too much his Tears, too much his Sighs persuade; Think—And he then Embrac'd me—Think he Cri'd. For thee, how much I wou'd, and have deny'd. Never! Oh never with the King Comply, But rather than forget thy Honour, die. Yes! Cruel Tyrant, Death is my Defence, No Pow'r shall force, nor Promise draw me hence My Friends, my Father to their Rights restore, 'Tis all I ever askt, who ne're will ask thee more. EPISTLE III. The Earl of Salisbury being absent in France, the Scots attack his Castle in the North, where his Lady was Beseig'd: The Black Prince marches to relieve her, sees her from the Battlements of the Castle, falls in love with her; and the Earl dying sometime after, Marries her. His Passion for this Lady, and her Answer; are the Subject of the following Epistles Edward the Black Prince, to the Countess Salisbury. Tho' this Address is in a hateful Strain, I suffer, and 'tis just I shou'd Complain. Pitty the Pain my honest Heart endures, Nor use it ill, because so soon 'twas yours. With Smiles the profer of my Love receive, The richest Present that a Prince can give. No Frown thus distant, and unseen I fear, And best this Paper will your Fury bear. On this insensible, you'll wast your scorn, 'Twill nothing, use it as you please, return? Shou'd you Condemn the writer to Despair, This still entreats you, still it speaks you fair. If you've a Soul to judge of good and ill, And Justice, as it ought, directs your Will. Consult this Guide, and in your Mind survey, Or what shou'd further, or oppose my way? Obey her Precepts, ev'ry Doubt remove, Or tell me why you will or shoud'n Love. Since things inanimate, so well agree, They teach you how you ought to look on me? As Eccho listens to the Shepherds sighs, The sound she catches, and as fast Replies. Two strings in Harmony, if tun'd alike You move the Second, when the First you strike. In those no Discord, as in you we find, Whose Reason better, shou'd Inform your Mind. Nature that made you so Divinely Fair, Has giv'n you Sense to judge of what you are? Too just to your Perfections, since you see, No want in them or you, nor worth in me? When your fair Hands, their wondrous softness feel, That nothing, they believe, their touch excell. When in your Glass, your Eyes, their Lustre view The day they fancy 's not so bright as you. And ev'ry grace, believes its self Divine Not more, because 'tis good, than that 'tis thine. Your Beauties like Narcissus are destroy'd, By being by themselves too much enjoy'd: Why shou'd you Languish with your own Desire, 'Tis needless, Beauty shou'd itself admire. The Sun whose Beams diffusive or'e Mandkind, Gives Light to all, yet to himself is blind. Once I believ'd I cou'd thy Charms endure, I gaz'd with Joy, yet hop'd I was secure? But when their Graces to my Ruin joyn'd, My Eyes convey'd the Poison to my Mind. With safety I beheld their pow'r apart, Whose force united triumph'd o'er my Heart. In every glance some new delight I found, And every future look encreas'd my Wound. Till every Charm with equal rapture pleas'd, And I no more distingusht which was best. Till perfect to my Soul thy Beauties came, And perfect as thy Beauty was my flame. If, and 'tis strange, you hate to be belov'd, Your Care is quickly with the Cause remov'd. Say to your Eyes, thus far you shall extend Your awful sway, and here desire shall end; Or blunt the Darts that give the fatal Wounds, Let Love prescrib'd, no more transgress his bounds. This done—But oh! thou sooner mayst command The restless Waves to sleep upon the Strand. Despair may sooner think complaint in vain, Pleasure be sooner reconcil'd to Pain. Pride may grow humble, Envy gen'rous prove, Than all that see thee wou'd forbear to love. Our warlike Ancestors such Forts devis'd, That by your Foes you might not be surpriz'd. That your weak Sex might there securely rest, Since Fear soon settles in a Womans Breast. Tho' thine is of another temper far, And fitter than thy Castle for the War. This kindly dos thy Friends at least inclose, But that resists alike both Friends and Foes. Thy cruel Heart's invincible to all, And more obdurate than the Marble Wall. When Jove to wanton on a Virgins Breast, Has chang'd the God, and in his wish been blest. Of all the various shapes which he has try'd, To cheat his Mistress, and his Godhead hide. That suits me best, when in a golden show'r, He rain'd on Danae in her brazen Tow'r. I ne'er did envy his supream command, Nor that he bears the Thunder in his hand; But in so bright a storm I feign wou'd be, As he to her that I might come to thee. With Foes no longer you're begirt about, But less besieg'd within than they without. The Captive safer in your Bonds remains, Than under brazen Bolts or iron Chains. Such Thraldom I ere Liberty would choose, And for such Chains Imperial Crowns refuse. Were India's Treasures in thy Fort secur'd, And with her Wealth thy lovely self immur'd. Soon as your Foes this richer Treasure see, They'll leave the worthless heap to follow thee. What Arms your Towr's impregnible can win, If to defend 'em you remain within? Shou'd you your Eyes resistless force employ, With every glance they wound, with every wound destroy. Deeper their Arrows will transfix their hearts, Than theirs can pierce you with a thousand Darts. For there entrencht the Wariour Cupid lies, And thence he proudly all the World defies. No Want, no Famine have you need to fear, There never can be Want where you are there. Thy sight alone renews the vital Flood, And comforts Life without the help of Food. As at their post thy Soldiers keep their Ward, So thy chaste wishes all thy actions guard. Thy pulse with never ceasing motion beats, Prepar'd to give th' alarm when danger threats. Thy virtuous thoughts when all thy senses rest, Like careful Scouts flie up and down thy Breast, With honest Watch around their charge they keep, From wrong defend thee, and protect thy sleep. But tell me, may we not with reason fear, You will not guiltless to the World appear? So many by your Thefts have been undone, Say, may they not at last demand their own? Safe with your prize you in your Fort remain, And hear the helpless Crowd without complain. Nor Heaven, nor Earth, nor Nature have you spar'd, But rob'd 'em all and well may want a Guard. Your Eyes that wage with mine continual Wars, Their sparkling brightness borrow from the Stars. Your fragrant Lips which all your words adorn, Stole their fresh beauties from the Orient Morn. Your Cheeks to whom the water'd Lilly yields, Have rob'd their graces from the flowry fields. Your Breath has ravisht from Arabian Gums, Their richest odours and their best perfumes. Oh mighty Love exert thy utmost pow'r, To force this fair Enchantress from her Tow'r. Thus fenc'd if ere her Beauty wants supplies, She'll pillage Nature and exhaust the Skies. O'er thee she will in time usurp command, And wrest the Scepter from thy Infant hand. When to relieve you with my warlike pow'rs I first arriv'd, and saw you from your Towr's, You seem'd to my transported Soul so fair, The Place I thought was Heaven, and you an Angel there. But when by reason I those thoughts o'ercame, And view'd this wonder as a mortal frame. I cou'd no more the Scots attempt accuse, For who to gain thee wou'd the War refuse? In such a Treasure had his Realm been blest. The barren Region had excell'd the East. I march'd from his insult to set thee free, I vanquish'd him, but am enslav'd by thee. Thy danger's past, yet mine alas! remains, And I amid my triumphs drag thy Chains. Love in extreams unlawful methods tries, And what his Fortune wants, his Wit supplies. Jove by a mortal Nimph to be carest, Has oft assum'd the Man, and oft the Beast. By mighty Styx the Heav'nly Monarchs swears, And false himself with Lovers falshoods bears. Love matters not his Oaths to gain his Cause, His pleasure is his Rule, his will his Laws. When he's most true he most himself belies, And in his want of Wisdom's only wise. By lawless means he lawful bliss obtains, And then is most sincere when most he feigns. Forgive my fault to chastity and thee, Since who can see thee and from fault be free? 'Tis then it ere the Gods themselves excell, When they forgive their Creatures who rebel. When all thy Tryals are enroll'd by Fame, And all thy Sex made glorious by thy Name. I shall be offer'd at thy virtue's shrine, Mine the dishonour, and the glory thine. I'll burn no longer with a guilty flame, But change the Lovers for a Husbands name. Thy House by thy descent is made divine, Else I might boast my blood as good as thine. 'Tis England's Heir who woos thee to his Arms, And sure a Crown, if not my Love has Charms. Yet what I am I call my own no more, Take what thou wilt, and what thou wilt restore. For my past wishes let my future plead, Forgive the bad, and let the good succeed. May Heav'n the surest Guardian of the fair, From wrong defend what best deserves his care. Against thy Virtue all designs destroy, And equal with thy wishes be thy joy. The Countess of Salisbury to Edward the Black Prince. As one that fain wou'd grant, and fain denie, I doubtful what I ought to do, reply, My Sexes weakness I in this declare, And yielding to a Treaty, yield too far. For Love may turn the favour to offence, And wrest my meaning to a guilty sense. Of utmost caution have we Women need, To Write what Lovers with design will Read. Not always silence can preserve our Fame, And every look's perverted to our shame. While in our breasts our hidden thoughts remain, The Tongue of flander shews its sting in vain. But once declar'd, she seizes 'em as prize, And wounds our Virtue with invenom'd lyes. Resolv'd to Write, and fearing what to send, I wish, before I will begin, to end. Respect, when I wou'd finish, bids me stay, And my Heart tells me I have more to say. Some secret which I tremble to confess, And Words too little or too much express. What I wou'd say, I feign as said to thee, Then fancy what thou wouldst reply to me. The fairest prospect of thy cause I view, And then consider what's to honour due. A thousand things in your excuse I frame, Your cause is weak, and my defence the same. A Prince, a Hero courts me I confess, Your worth in this is more, and mine the less. Your Bed's for me a too exalted place, My Subject fortune will the Throne disgrace. For this alone I should your vows reprove, In me 'tis Treason to accept your love. Each Sex in love their priviledge may use, 'Tis Man's to tempt, and Woman's to refuse We ne'er without our own consent are won, And ne'er can be but by ourselves undone. You of your love and your success may boast, Who blames the Lover when the Maid is lost. 'Tis brave in you our Innocence to try In us, when Woo'd 'tis glorious to deny. The Crime in you, is by the Crime excus'd, We censur'd most, when we are most abus'd. 'Tis Beauties high Prerogative to grant; It shou'd not beg, for it can nothing want. We shou'd no Hearts by wanton Arts surprize, Nor shoot pernicious Glances with our Eyes; For, if with Modesty a Woman parts She gains Contempt, when she wou'd conquer Hearts. In Henry, and John's misfortune, you May learn to shun the Evil you persue. To you their Story shou'd a Lesson be, And the fair Virgins, whom they wrong'd, to me. The Father, when he had his Mistris won, His Mistris blames, Matilda blames the Son. Your Lordly Sex is Accessary still, And our's condemn'd as Principals in Ill: What praise can we but by our Vertue claim? We lose our Merit, when we lose our Fame. This Fortress we our selves can best defend, Which ne'er is lost but by the Force we lend: Shou'd Malice strive our Innocence to wrong, True to our selves, she cou'd not hurt us long. To your Invasions, when we basely yield, The shame is ours, and yours the glory of the Field. The hope of Nations, Edward now is stil'd; But your Renown, will by your Love be soil'd. Where (will the Realms in vile derison say) Is the young Hero we must once obey? Where he, that conquer'd in the Gallick Plains, Subdu'd their Chiefs, and led their Kings in Chains: Has he forsook the noble Chace of Arms, To wast his Fortune on a Womans Charms? Can Victory no more his Soul inspire, And melts he softly in a wanton Fire? Is he, who dealt in France a thousand Wounds, And bound her Monarchs, led himself in Bonds? Twice to the Bridal Altar I've been led: Two Lords successively injoy'd my Bed. The waster time my Charms must have destroy'd: The Beauty wear that has been twice injoy'd. For a young Prince, is this a worthy Store Of which two Subjects were possest before. Let France or Spain their Princesses prefer, To make you happy, and your Empire share With you, They come from an Imperial Line, And nothing can you see to tempt in mine; For me the Royal Station's to sublime, And e'en to please you were in me a Crime. Though for my life I must your Suit deny, Yet rather than not love you I cou'd dye. My noble Lord, to tell me, wou'd delight, The wonders he has seen you do in Fight. No Mothers Voice, when with her Babe she plays, Like his, cou'd Flatter, in his Princes praise. I catcht the Musick from his charming Tongue: My ravisht Soul on every Accent hung. I curst the minutes that they roul'd so fast, And wisht the darling Theam wou'd ever last. No harmony so moving to the Ear, And he as fond to speak as I to hear: To ev'ry word with pleasure I attend, And heard him, with regret, his Story end. On you, whene're he talkt the Subject, fell, And I prais'd him for praising you so well. Must I now loath what I have lov'd so long. And fear from such a Prince the greatest wrong? Yes! I must hate you, and cou'd almost swear You'l hate your self, when you your fault shall hear. Consider Time will cool your hot desire, Or Reason quench at last the raging Fire. By you, and Justice, let my Cause be try'd, And if I am not injur'd then decide. In vain my Father, Reverend by his years, Beg'd me to yield, and deign'd to beg with Tears. In vain persuasion sooth'd me to comply, Twas Sin to grant, and Merit to deny. My Mother boldly both your Pray'rs withstood, And with her Frowns restrain'd your boiling Blood; Aw'd by her Vertue, of her Frowns afraid To try my weakness, you a while delay'd. How faithfully I love you, I have shown, Your Honour, in preserving, with my own. Had your base wishes in your Suit prevail'd; Or had I, foolish, in my Duty fail'd: You wou'd not guiltless to the World have prov'd; But been as much abhor'd as you're belov'd. Against you, thus the Nations would have said, Her Parents sin must to his charge be laid. To save her Life she sacrific'd her Fame, And gain'd her dear bought Liberty with shame. Did our strong Castle vail her lofty Fanes, To your bright Ensigns on the Northern Plains? When your shril Trumpets eccoh'd from a far, Did I, with joy return the sound of War? Did I receive you as my Soveraign Lord, To perish by your Lust, who triumph'd by your Sword? The Foe, that for the Treasure came, is fled, And left a Foe more dangerous in his stead, The vanquisht Enemy for Plunder came: The Victor Edward to attack my Fame. Ready to fly the Scot begirt me round; Bent on my ruin you maintain your ground. How cou'd I here reproach you, but respect Restrains my anger. that cou'd much reflect. A Princess name I neither court nor slight, Nor am ambitious of your Consort's Right; Nor wou'd I study by deceitful Lures To get that Title, or to make me yours. Too humble in my own esteem, I ne'r To such a height could one so low prefer. Happy if I obtain'd a second place To wait on her, that shou'd deserve your grace; Yet, if my Prince shall nothing ill require, And safely I may yield to his desire. If he no more will of my Bounty want Than he may well demand, and I may grant? If in due bounds he will his Youth confine, Let all his wishes be as Chast as mine. I'll plight the Faith which I from him receive, And what he freely asks, will freely give. EPISTLE IV. Queen Isabel, Daughter of Philip the Fair King of France, and Wife to Edward II. King of England, being very much enrag'd to see her self despis'd by her Husband and his Minions, engag'd the Valiant young Lord Roger Mortimer, in her Interest, who with several Potent Barons took Arms to rescue the King out of his Favourites Hands, and restore the Queen to the dignity of her Rank; but both Mortimer, and the Barons were defeated, himself imprison'd in the Tower, whence by the help of a sleepy Portion the Queen sent him he deceiv'd his Guards, and escap'd to France. She writes to him, and Congratulates his safety, and Mortimer replys as became a Person she had very much oblig'd. Queen Isabel to the Lord Mortimer. Till late, my Mortimer was wont to see Mirth, Pleasure, Gaiety, and Joy in me. My Letter now can bring him no relief, So much my Mind's distracted by my Grief. Yet by my Pity I my Friendship prove, And what my Temper wants, supply with Love. Why do I mourn? and how can I forbear? Does Wigmore's The Mortimers, Lords of Wigmore and Earls March. absence not deserve a Tear? When I reflect, how we were forc'd to part, My weeping Eyes, betray my akeing Heat. But thinking 'twas to save and set thee free, My Troubles cease, and I rejoyce in Thee. This to my Soul some little Comfort gives, My Sorrow soothes, and my Care relieves. And thus amid the Torments I endure, I flatter the Desease, I cannot Cure. Blest be the Stars, anspicious to your flight, To Love, and Lovers ever blest the Night. The Air was gentle, and the Sky serene, And all things slept, but Wigmore and the Queen. The luckiest Minute of our Lives we chose, Releas'd the Hero, and deceiv'd his Foes. I dreaded much when I prepar'd the Juice, Mortimer invited Sir Stephen Segrave Constable of the Tower, with his Officers, to Feast with him on his Birth-day the Potion the Queen sent him, he put into their Wine, which set them asleep, and thus he escap'd, swimming over the River to the Kentish shore. Or I might err, or that its Vertue lose. Or Fortune, seldom to the Gallant kind, Ruin the Project we so well design'd. Our Arts by other secret Arts oppos'd, Be thus made useless, or our Plot disclos'd. Fond of thy Safety, then I call to mind, The Drugs which we in ancient Fable find. And often wish'd for those the Poets dream, To grow by Latmos, or by Lethe's Stream. The Herbs that clos'd the watchful Dragon's Eyes, And gave the Grecian Youth the Golden Prize. Or those which Africk's sooty Lands produce, Or Indian Weeds and their malignant Juice. Soon as the Sun display'd his Orient Beams, I Walkt, where none observ'd me, by the Thames. My Thoughts on Mortimer were all employ'd, This Stream, I cry'd, has sav'd him, or destroy'd. Oft of the Chrystal Current I demand, Or, is he Lost? or, has he reach'd the Land? Say, for to thee, and to the faithless Wind, The Lord of all my Wishes I resign'd. Hast thou convey'd him on a gentle Wave, To the wish'd Shoar? or, is thy Deep his Grave? Tell me, Oh tell! for I impatient wait, To Joy in his Escape, or share his Fate. But sure, if thus my Mortimer had dy'd, A rougher Gale wou'd swell the guilty Tide. The Tempest in the furious Billows roar, And the Winds drive him breathless to the Shoar. The Winds so silent, and the quiet Stream, Reproach my Weakness, and my Fears condemn. The River Nymphs at my Confusion laugh, And all things tell me, Mortimer is safe. Where are the boasted Wonders of my Eyes? That Edward thus can leave me or despise. When Europe's Monarchs at our Nuptials met, Prince Edward married the Princess Isabel at Bulloigne where the Kings of the Romans, Navarr and Sicily, with the Flowers of the English and French Nobility were present, and the Pomp of the Tilts very magnificent. This Princess was the eldest and only Daughter of Philip the Fair, and Sister to Charles IV. King of France, on whose Death, the Kingdom fell to Edward II. in right of his Wife; and the Kings of England have ever since born the Arms of France, and asserted their Right to that Crown with different Success. With Envy they beheld him at my Feet. For this did I prefer him to the rest, To be soon abandon'd for a Beast? Can I endure to see a wanton Boy, King Edward gave to Gaveston his Favourite, the Jewels and Treasures his Father left him, marrying him to his Niece by his Sister Ican and Gilbert Clare Earl of Glocester; he liv'd with this Youth (suppos'd to be of a spurious Birth, and a Gascoign by Nation) in all manner of Riot and Wantonness. Possess his Favour, and my Place enjoy? If Old, Deseas'd, or Ugly I were grown, 'Twere vain to think to be belov'd alone. But since I'm Young, and as they tell me, Fair, A Rival Minion, I no more will bear: No more the Daughter of a Mighty King, Stoop to the Fortune of a nameless Thing. To me his Gifts, to me his Love belongs, And ev'ry Monarch shou'd resent my Wrongs. In me the Royal Dignity's profan'd, And Beauty with the basest Scandal stain'd. A Princess Young and Fair to be bereft, Of right and Favour for a Minion left. Edward by Gav'ston, and his Imps bewitch'd, With Towns and Treasures has the Wretch enrich'd. His spurious Blood with Noble Glo'ster's mix'd, A Shame eternal on his House has fix'd. Did the First Edward lead his Warlike Bands, This weak Prince offer'd his right in France to the French King, and his right in Scotland to Robert Bruce, if they would aid him in the War against the Barons, on the account of Gaveston. To Conquer for the second Forein Lands: That what with Glory, and with Toil he won, Might wantonly be lavish'd by his Son. Supported by the King, the Boy pretends, To crush his Kindred, and insult his Friends: One, whom his Father with his latest Breath, Forbad his Presence, and condemn'd to Death. This to the Nobles was his last Command, Gav'ston shall die, if seen on English Land. True to his Will, the faithful Barons stood, Confirm'd by Oaths, and seal'd it with their Blood. The Lords to force him from their Master, rise, And Lancaster is slain, and Warwick dies. Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and Guy Earl of Warwick, swore to the late King Edward, they would withstand his Son, if he did not throw off Gaveston, and were slain in attempting it. No sooner are we yet from Gav'ston freed, Than Slaves as wretched in his place succeed. The Spencers The Spencers, Father and Son, when Gaveston was gone, fill'd his Place, the Son was made Lord Chancellor, and the Father, Earl of Winton, as great Villains both, as the other. They fell afterwards, and had the same Fate with Gaveston. now enjoy what he possest, The People beggar'd, and the Lords deprest. Edward has only chang'd the Fav'rites Name, The same their Pow'r, their Tyranny the same. Honours and Riches, like the first they get, And will, the Ruin he began, Compleat. He wasts his Father's Conquests and his Store, To leave his Son contemptible and poor. Of this, I often have with with Tears complain'd, And highly Injur'd, no relief obtain'd. For Tyrants who delight in doing Ill, Grow worse, if any dare oppose their Will. The Senate only can our Wrongs redress, And right the Queen, and give the Nation Peace. To Punishment deserv'd, the Traytors bring, Expose their Guilt, and undeceive the King. Not long my Brother these Affronts will bear, Not long will his Allies refuse the War. Justice alike, to him and me deny'd, Enough his Patience, oft provok'd, is try'd. The ancient Homage which to France you owe, Edward I. did homage for these Provinces to the King of France. For Aquitain, for Guienne and Poitou. A Sister's Suffering, and a Brother's Right, For this, who wou'd not, will for nothing Fight. Revenge for past, and fear of future Harms, Will rouse the animated Gauls to Arms. Troops will from ev'ry distant Province come, In hopes to drive the bold Invaders home. The Sturdy Flamand, and the Stout Almain, Breton and Norman to the hostile Plain: All to the Royal Ensign will repair, And joyn with Fury in the righteous War. When Mortimer the fierce Battalion heads, They're sure of Conquest, whom the Hero leads. Think of the Honours of thy Martial Race, Thy bleeding Nation, and thy Queen's Disgrace. But if the boasted Valour of thy Name, Thy Father's Laurels, and thy proper Fame: If nor thy Country, nor thy injur'd House, Thy drooping Spirits in distress can rouse; Let my last Service thy Compassion move, And what you owe to Glory, give to Love: Engage my Brother in his Sister's Cause, To punish Traytors, and protect the Laws. How vain? For me a Woman to desire, To add new Heat to thy Immortal Fire. Too forward of thy self, to rush on Fate, Nor need'st to be provok'd by Love or Hate. To us Misfortune's so familiar grown, I rather shou'd prevent, than push thee on; Since by opposing, we encrease our Pains, Death seems the only Comfort which remains. Well, I remember, and shall ne'r forget, The Barons Forces receiv'd a great overthrow at Burrough-Bridge in York-shire, by the Earl of Carlisle, Commander for the King. How much we suffer'd by our last Defeat. When the best Blood that flow'd in English Veins, A fatal Deluge! dy'd the Northern Plains. So weak we then appear'd, so low we fell, The Slaves are too much frighten'd to rebel. The Reverend Peer, by whose Advice we go, Torlton, Bishop of Hereford, a Favourite of the Queen's and Morrimer's Faction. Of late's become suspected by the Foe. So difficult in such Important Things, To hide, what many watch, the Fate of Kings. My Thoughts, My Words, if often I repeat, 'Tis Grief which makes me, what I write forget. My Sorrows, fast, as they are told, renew, Beginning still, when I wou'd bid adieu. This, the best Token of my Love, receive, 'Tis little, but 'tis all I have to give. Lord Mortimer to Queen Isabella. Cou'd I such Comfort, as you sent, return, The Queen, like Mortimer, wou'd cease to mourn: What Pleasure in my Letters will you find? Where every Word's the Picture of my Mind. The dread of dying like a Slave remains, And I think still, as if I wrote in Chains. My Words, my Thoughts, are like my Fortune, low, With too much Care deprest, and too much Woe. Twice from my Queen I have my Life receiv'd, The two Mortimers, Roger Lord of Wigmore, and his Uncle the elder Lord Mortimer, were apprehended first in the West, and the Queen, by means of Torlton Bishop of Hereford, and Beak Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem, then in great Favour, prevail'd so much with the King, that he was pacifi'd, and consented to forgive the Mortimers on their Submission. Once sav'd from Murder, and from Death Repriev'd: My Life, and all that I by her enjoy, To Right her, or Revenge her I'll employ. I ne'r had ventur'd from the dangerous Height, Amid the Foe, and Terrors of the Night. With waxen Wings I never had presum'd, To fly the Death to which my Friends were doom'd: The Lord Mortimer was condemn'd for his insurrection with Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and Bobun Earl of Hereford, he lay under the Sentence of Death three Months, and by the sleepy Potion he receiv'd from the Queen, deceiv'd his Guard and escap'd a few days before the time appointed for his Execution; he got down by Ladders made of Cords, and the Spectators were much surpris'd to see afterwards from what height he ventur'd, having then the River of Thames to swim. The dreadful Deep had turn'd my giddy Head, And falling, I had met, the Fate I fled. The Foe, with Horror, view'd the wondrous Height, And scarce believ'd, when they were told my Flight. So many Perils I had never run, But a Queen's Love and Beauty urg'd me on. I launch'd undaunted in the airy Sea, By your Eyes, lighted thro' the dubious Way. The wat'ry Element, I then explore, And the Waves left me on the friendly Shore. My Goddess, you, to whom I only pray'd, And to your Beauty all my Vows were made, My Pray'r you answer'd, and my Vows repaid. The sleepy Potion which your Art prepar'd, Work'd as you wish'd it, and secur'd the Guard. With ghastly Steps I reach'd the Depths profound, Descended Safe, and trod the solid Ground. The liquid Paths, I like Leander try'd, Your Eyes, as Hero's were the Youth's, my Guide. A fairer Image, to my mind, I set, A better Fate deserv'd, a better met. At your Command, the Winds their Fury cease, And curl the Waters with a wanton Breeze. Thus Dancing on the sportive Waves I ride, Born by the Billows to the safer Side. Proud my of Freedom, I my Course persue, For nothing wish'd, for nothing griev'd, but You. My fear, the Foe by my scape enrag'd, The Ills which you have since endur'd, presag'd. To leave you thus expos'd, my Joy allay'd, More of your Safety, than my own afraid. Not long shall Spencer Laugh at my Disgrace, The Spencers then great with the King, knew they could not be safe while such a turbulent Spirit as the Lord Mortimer was in England, and their Enemy. Nor long the Nation and my Queen oppress. If England shou'd 'n her Assistance grant, She more will me, than I shall England want. This odious Exile, may our Cause advance, And what it lost in England, get in France. Fame the great Actions of my Fathers spreads, Their Bounty, Vertue, and Heroic Deeds. The British Order in our House renew'd, Roger, called the Great Lord Mortimer, Grand-father to this young Lord who was afterwards Earl of March, erected a round Table at Kenelworth in Warwick-shire, where was one of the most magnificent Castles in England, for a hundred Knights and a hundred Ladies, and the Entertainment of all Adventurers from any Part of Christendom, in imitation of Arthur's. Confirms the ancient Honours of our Blood. To Kenelworth, the Warrior Knights repair, And prove their Might, and justifie the Fair. None went from Mortimer, or poor, or griev'd, The Wrong were righted, and the Poor reliev'd. The Scots, while Wigmore led our Armies forth, Ne'r ventur'd to disturb the peaceful North. They ne'er for Plunder wander'd from their Bounds, Nor sent the English back with shameful Wounds. To Edward's Valour, and to ours they yield, For Dead, as Living, Edward won the Feild. Edward I. order'd at his Death, that his Bones should be carry'd into Scotland by his Successors, in their Wars, being perswaded by a Prophecy, that the English wou'd be fortunate while he or his Bones were with them. But the Son's Actions stain the Father's Fame, And Edward now is an inglorious Name. Ne'er will his Flight at Strivcling be forgot, Edward II. made a very great Expedition against Scotland, where he lost near the River Bamocksburn by Striveling upwards of 60000 Men, the only considerable overthrow the Scots ever gave the English. Edward carry'd his Minions, and they theirs with them to this War, for which they prepar'd with excess of Riot and Disorder. An Honour to our Foes, to us, a Blot. In wanton Revels he consum'd the Night, And reeling from his Tent, began the Fight: Happy, that Mortimer was then afar, Nor shar'd the Scandal of the Minions War. His Infamy I hear where e'er I come, Despis'd abroad, as he's abhor'd at home. Aid of a Thousand Nations I'll implore, Of People, and and of States unknown before, Far as our Navy spreads her Canvas Wings, I'll seek for Succour from the distant Kings. From Asia Troops, and from the Banks of Nile, Shall joyn with Wigmore, and invade our Isle. Or Traytors shall no more the King abuse, Our Rights to Me, nor to my Queen refuse. Their Lands we'll ravage, and their Cities burn, And justly their Injustice will return. We'll seek them with our Armies and our Fleet, And, in the dusty Field, the Tyrant meet. Nor tamely wait till he persues us here, But brave his Fury and insult his Fear. The Minions and their Master's Pow'r we'll try, Nor Fight like Pyrats, nor in ambush lie. With our shrill Trumpets and repeated Cries, We'll fright the Air and rend the vaulted Skies. The shining Corslet and the golden Shield, With all the graceful Terror of the Field: The Crest, the Lance, the prancing Sreed prepar'd, They'll fear us in their turn, whom late we fear'd. Our Fleet attending the propitious Gales, To plow the watry way, and fill the Sails: A Guest unwelcom to the Thames shall come, And raise with forein Oars his silver Foam: Along his flow'ry Banks shall proudly Coast, And Mortimer triumphant, land his Host. A num'rous Band, from diff'rent Regions chose Our Friends to Succour, and Chastise our Foes. Rome, to our Arms, her Thunders too will joyn, Pope Clement V. sent Guastelline and Lucas, two Cardinals, into England, to compose the Differences between King Edward and the Barons, to whose desire the King seem'd to comply, and while they were in England, appear'd willing to keep the Peace, but as soon as they left him he broke his Promise, began the War with Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and was accurst at Rome. Our Cause, by her Resentment, made Divine. Whatever Prince to Tyranny pretends, Must make Religion, and the Priests his Friends. But Edward, wisely, first offended Rome, And Persecutes his Subjects then at Home. Curst by the Church, and whom the Church has curst, Or soon, or late, are sure to have the worst: Who fears not Mortimer, the Church may dread The best Pretence, and what will still succeed. Since every Fool, at least, has so much Zeal, However, he obeys to wish her well. There are two many at this day who pretending Zeal for a Church, whose Doctrines they neither practise nor understand, hide by this their Interest and Ambition, make themselves heads of Parties, and deceive the unthinking Crowd with their plausible Pretences, as there are many inferior Wretches, who Quarrel, Drink and Swear for the Faith and Ceremonies of which they have no manner of Notion. Guyenne and Aquitain, the French invade, Charles IV. then King of France, invaded those Provinces which were at that time subject to the Crown of England, stirr'd to it by the perswasion of the exile Mortimer, in hopes to favour the Queen his Sister's Cause by it. They had been long in possession of the English, whom the French often attempted to dispossess. For Homage, or deny'd or long delay'd. Their King enrag'd will meet a weak Defence, And quickly will his Army drive us thence. The Towns which so much Blood and Treasure cost, An easie Conquest, will to Charles be lost. The Gauls to England will no more submit, Their past Subjection, and their Fears forget. Nor from our Bows, nor from our Lances fly, The English Bow-men, as famous in those days, as their Infantry are now; that by the confession of the French our Enemies, were the last disorder'd in the late War, and the first in any dangerous Attack. Busside Rabutin's Life of Lewis XIV. But scorn our Weakness and our Pow'r defie. Shake off their Chains, their Libety maintain, Nor soon will yield to be our Slaves again. The Valiant Bruce shall in your Brother's Aid, Bruce King of Scotland, and an ally to Charles. The Northern Counties with his Scots invade. Death, Fire and Ruin will the Realm surround, And War on every side our Foes confound. The Tyrant frighted shall resign his Crown, And a Third Edward fill the vacant Throne. Whose future Laurels will restore the Name, To its first Glory, and increase its Fame. Her'ford and Warwick in our Quarrel dead, The Earls of Lancaster and Warwick, who fell at Pomfret were thought to be Saints by the People when dead, as they were their Favourites when living. Great Miracles were reported to be done by their Relicts. They canoniz'd also Bobun Earl of Hereford, slain at Burrough Bridge, and if there are any worthy of such Divine Honour, they are certainly those who die in Defence of their Religion, their Country, and their Liberties: none being more profligate and wicked, nor more worthy of Hate when living, and Scorn when dead, than those who for Revenge or Advancement, contrive the Ruin of their Country by encouraging Factions and Discontents, and that Person must make an abominable Patriot, who never was against betraying his Country till he could not have the Profit of it, and has since been the most forward when it was most in his Power, and he could do it with most Advantage. Are Saints and Martyrs by the People made: Their sacred Relicts by the sick are worn, And Cripples to their Graves for Cure are born. Their Love to us, we may by them perceive, For them they wou'd'n, or for us wou'd grieve. So Fav'rite mighty, as he is, and Great, Shall e'er possess our Wigmore's ancient Seat. Wigmore, a Seat in Hereford shire, belonging to the Mortimers, who were Earls of the Marches of Wales, or Lords of the Borders. With his new Trophies he shall ne'er debase, The long descended Houours of our Race. Nor Son, nor Father lead our Vassals forth, To fight the Traytor's Battles in the North. Ne'er be the Guardians of the British Pales, Defending England, or preserving Wales. Our Wrongs had been at first redress'd with ease, They grow with time, and while delay'd encrease. Such Spies about us, and so oft betray'd, Our Plots must secret and secure be laid. Let our past Errors future Faults correct, And Care dissemble, what our Foes suspect. No anxious Thoughts shou'd in your Looks be seen And still you shou'd remember, you're a Queen. This only can your Dignity maintain, Till Fortune in our Favour turns again. EPISTLE V. King Richard II. having resign'd the Crown to Henry of Bullingbroke Duke of Lancaster, Hereford, &amp;c. afterwards King Henry IV. he was shut up in Pontefract Castle. And Isabel his Queen flies to her Father Charles VI. the French King. She sends him this Epistle from France; and the King her Husband, sends her the next from Pontefract. Queen Isabel to King Richard II. As Philomel, Companion of the Spring, Bewails her Fate, so I my Sorrow sing. My Words are interrupted by my Sighs, While Floods of Tears are flowing from my Eyes. How much I grieve, I want the Pow'r to tell, The Pains for you, and for my self, I feel. Think, by your own, the Burthen of my Care, And guess my misery, by your Despair. 'Tis Just my Sorrow shou'd to them return, By whom I suffer, and by whom I mourn. France is a Stranger to the Guilt and Shame, To England let 'em go, as thence they came. At Pomfret, ever be the Place accurst, My Griefs were born, and let 'em there be nurst. Still was the North, unhappy to your Race, Yet most Unhappy in this last Disgrace. What they can't help the neighb'ring Kings deplore, And future Ages will your Chains abhor. Yet since our Ills are now beyond a Cure, 'Tis best to yield to what we must endure. I hate my Eyes, that they cou'd deign to see His publick Entry. The proud Usurper, that were us'd to thee. Impatient of my Lord, a while I stood, The Tyrant and his pompous Entry view'd. But, Oh! how daunted and surpris'd I look, When seeking thee, I met with Bullingbrok? The Crowd with Shouts repeated, rend the Air, I askt 'em for the King, they pointed, there. Again, I sought thee, but I sought in vain, For, curse the Sight, 'twas Bullingbrook again. Thy Robes he wore, and on thy courser Rode, Yet lookt a Monster, where you lookt a God. As Mars, my Hero was as rough in War, In Love, as soft as Cupid, and as fair. An awful Aspect, and a gentle Soul, Our Sex to Conquer, and his own Controul. Curst be the Day, when Her'ford shou'd have try'd Bullingbrook then Duke of Hereford, was challeng'd by Mowbray Duke of Norfolk, for words spoke against him to the King, the Combat was to have been try'd at Coventry, but they were both banish'd before it came so far. His might on Mowbray, or by him have dy'd. In saving him, you have yourself undone, Whose Death, demanded, had secur'd the Throne. I saw at Coventry the furious Lord, The sturdy Lance prepare, and girt the Sword. The Heralds came, the Judges were decreed, Each Warrior mounted on a foaming Steed. They sternly frown'd, and blush'd with mutual Rage, The Signal only wanting to engage. Their Coursers champt the Bit and tore the Ground, Alike, impatient of the Noble Sound. Curse on the Minute which your Mercy lost, The Price of Freedom, and a Kingdom's Cost. For ever let it inauspicious be, To all the World, as 'tis to you and me. Norfolk, the Combat wou'd have justly won, And Her'ford vanquish'd, you had sav'd the Crown. Ador'd no longer than he kept his Pride, The Peoples Love had with his Glory dy'd. My Father kindly did the Wretch receive, The Duke of Hereford fled to France. Pity his Fortune, and his Wrongs believe. Such Royal Honours to the Traytor shown, As Heir to Gaunt, and Kindred to the Throne. The vile Dissembler, thus his Subjects draws, To think him injur'd, and defend his Cause. Your March against the Rebel Kerns I view'd, King Richard went against the Rebels in Ireland, where he was when Henry landed. And heard the Shoutings of the changing Crowd: When Millions on their Knees submissive fell, And weeping, blest the King, and curst O Neal. To lose you then a day, they scarce afford, And all their Hopes were their returning Lord. Their Lord returning, they disdain to see, So fond of Bullingbrook, so false to thee. Kings like the Sun, are ever in our sight, And Clouds are quickly seen that shade the Light. Monarchs Illustrious, like the Day appear, But Spots discover'd, if we look too near: They fansie when among their Slaves they shine, Who call 'em so, believe they are Divine. But Judges that approach too near the Throne, See the King's Faults, who cannot see his own. And while to Prosper him, on Heav'n they call, His Ruin they contrive, and wish his Fall. What new Pretence has Her'ford to the Crown, William of Wickham so enrag'd with John of Gaunt, for his opposing the Clergy, and favouring the Followers of Wickliff, that he pretended the Queen confest to him on her Death-Bed, that the Child she was deliver'd of, was Female, and that John of Gaunt was the Son of a Fleming, so much was the Royal Line oblig'd to that ambitious Prelate. Or from his Father's Right, or from his own. His Father, such as shou'd not err, have said, Was the base Issue of a Peasant's Bed. Law, Reason, and Descent his claim confute, While none your Title, or your Birth dispute. Descended from the Victor Edward's Son, A greater Hero, his Imperial Crown, More rightfully is yours, than those he won. Giving him to understand the ill Title his Father had to her Father's Kingdom. Ne'er had the Rebel ventur'd on the Coast, Nor landed on our Shoar his impious Host. With these he ne'er had dar'd you to the Fight, Too weak to hurt us, and too few to fright. But that your Counsels to the Foe betray'd, Incourag'd Her'ford, and your Friends dismaid. The Peircys first the promis'd Succours bring, Against their sworn Allegiance to the King: Against their Duty to the rightful Heir, Edmund Mortimer Earl of March, (whose Aunt Elnor, the Lord Percy marry'd) was descended from Philippa, Daughter of Leonel Duke of Clarence, which Mortimer in right of his Mother, as Heiress to the third Son of Edward III. King Richard when he went to Ireland, proclaim'd Heir apparent to the Crown. And their own Nephew, Valiant Mortimer. When first I came to England and the Throne, Like a new Star amid your Court I shone. I drew, and ravish'd the beholders Eyes, And then they worshipt whom they now despise. Or thus they would not our Misfortune see, Nor Live contented till the King is free. Why, by the Tyrant were we forc'd to part, Least thy Queen's Love should ease thy aking Heart. A wretched Comfort, for my Lord to see, The Chains which wound his Royal Limbs, on me. 'Twas worse to lose thy Kingdom than thy Life, Yet still 'tis worse to be deny'd thy Wife. His Hate, his Malice, cou'd no farther go, Nor load us with a Weight of greater Woe. Oh? wou'd Aumarl had perish'd ere betray'd, The Abbot of Westminster had plotted to kill King Henry at a Tilt at Oxford. The Hollands, Dukes of Exeter and Surrey, the Duke of Aumarl, the Earl of Salisbury, Spencer Earl of Gloucester, the Bishop of Carlisle, Sir Thomas Blunt and others had bound themselves by an Oath, to assassinate their Sovereign, which the Duke of Aumarl discover'd. The Plot, the Nobles, had to save thee, laid. Nor liv'd to break the solemn Oath he took, To free the King, and punish Bullingbrook. Wou'd he had been the Ransom of our Friends, Brought by his Treason to inglorious Ends. They fell untimely, as we mourn their Fate, They gone too soon, and we remain too late. Oh! that my Pow'r was equal to my Will, To curse the Tyrant, as I wish him ill. All the dire Torments and the Plagues of Life, A Son rebellious, and a wanton Wife. Chains, Poverty, and Shame shou'd be his Lot, And his vile Offspring e're they ripen, rot. Green, Scroop and Bushy, Witness to his Guilt, Favourites of King Richard hang'd at Bristol in Henry's Progress to Flint Castle. With Seas of Blood, which he unjustly spilt. For Vengeance, Thousands he has murder'd call, And Vengeance dreadful on his Head will fall. He swore he did not at the Kingdom aim, The lose part of the Clergy and others who think their Power cannot be supported but under an Arbitrary Monarchy, have always blacken'd this Story and the Character of Henry IV. whose Right to the Crown, by the abdication of Richard II. was undisputable. The Historians of this Party, pretend King Henry swore at Doncaster, he desir'd nothing but his Father's Inheritance, and nothing intended against King Richard or his Crown. That Gaunt's Possessions only were his Claim. Ye Pow'rs! who saw him at your Altars bow, Bless him, or Curse him, as he kept his Vow. May his own Bullingbrook our Cause revenge On Percy, and his Wife repent the Change. So basely Cruel to insult my Woe, May he that has advanc'd her, bring her low: As I for thee, may she for Percy mourn, And his foul Treason on himself return. In her Son's loss, in Hotspurs let her see, Her Curse fell on Hotspur, who rebelling against King Henry, was slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury. What Gallant Mortimer's has been to me. Let her of Honour and Estate be spoyl'd, And poor and helpless, be at last exil'd. How shall I comfort you in such Distress? Or rouse your Courage, which your Chains depress? A King's unworthy of the Royal Name, Who's fond of Living, tho' he lives with Shame. Of Crown, of Liberty and Friends bereft, Death is the only Refuge we have left. And rather than in odious Bondage lie, What King, but you, would be afraid to die. Slaves may their Fate with fruitless Tears deplore, A King shou'd be himself, or be no more. Not long the Tyrant will a Rival bear, Prevent his Cruelty and end your fear, May the Just Pow'rs who best your Suff'rings know, Above Reward you for your Wrongs below. King Richard II. to Queen Isabel. What can you hope from your unhappy Lord, Whose Pen's as useless to him as his Sword? Both fail alike in my unskilful Hand, And I write now, as I did once Command. What can I say, who cou'd a Kingdom lose, Will a young Queen the mighty Loss excuse? What Ease will this to your Affliction bring, From one who was, and is no more a King? My vile Condition will my Letters stain, And ev'ry Page be printed with my Chain. Like a gay Dream my former Glories pass, And scarce I can remember what I was. So low it sinks me, by my Stile you'll find, My Body's less in bondage than my Mind. In vain our Infamy I wou'd suppress, These Chains, this Misery my Shame confess. My Tongue which basely has renounc'd the Crown, King Richard deliver'd the Deed of Resignation to King Henry with his own Hand in the Tower, confest his inability to govern, and renounc'd the Kingly Power. If these were wanting, wou'd my Weakness own. My Hand that witness'd to the Deed wou'd shew, That all this Ruin to my Fears we owe. Cou'd you for me the Mighty Bourbon slight, For me, your Father and your Country quit? Young, as you were, to tempt a dangerous Sea, And trust your Beauty to the Winds for me. By the first Princes of your Realm ador'd, Cou'd you leave these, to seek a Forein Lord. Lewis Duke of Bourbon courted her before King Richard marry'd her, and would have taken her after she return'd to France, but her Father marry'd her to Charles Son to the Duke of Orleans. Were Europe's Treasures and her Monarchs scorn'd, That thus by me your Love shou'd be return'd. Did you for this ungrateful England chuse, That thus she might your Virgin Choice abuse. For me, your Friends and better Hopes forsake, To be thus rob'd and sent affronted back. When sleep, which only gives the wretched rest, Relieves the Sorrow of my lab'ring Breast. Oft to my sick Imagination kind, She brings my past Dominion to my mind. A King in all my former Pride I seem, And fancy then this Bondage but a Dream. I view with Joy, thy visionary Charms, And strive to clasp thee in my empty Arms. I think 'em real, as I I'd have 'em be, And Ixion like, embrace a Cloud for thee. I call my Love, and waking in the Fright, The Vision flies, and I am lost in Night. Oft, but in vain, I hope my Queen's retir'd, More welcom to return, and more desir'd. The Hours to me are tardy in their course, The past I wish for, and the present curse. When the Sun travels on his golden way, I wish for Night, and when 'tis Night, for Day. Old time, methinks, is in his Race too slow, And ev'ry minute, is an Age of Woe. No Change for me the various Seasons bring, And Winter is to me the same with Spring. Happy the People of the Southern sphere, Where Spring and Summer crown the fruitful Year. On me the Winter Winds with fury blow, Our Mountains cover'd with perpetual Snow. Pomfret, a proper Mansion for Despair, Confines me here, while you are happy there. How did the Rout their banish'd Her'ford mourn, When the King banish'd the Duke of Hereford, the People lamented very much, and were not content, till the King to please them, took off four of the ten Years exile for his Difference with Mowbray, who was sentenc'd to banishment for Life. And pray'd tumultuous for their Friends return. Not their own Griefs cou'd touch the Rabble more. Than Her'ford's, when he left the crowded Shore. When they no longer cou'd their Darling see, From blessing him, they turn'd to cursing me. The Sentence lessen'd, still their Rage encrease, They want him here, and will have nothing less. My Friends fore saw the Mischiefs they design'd, And I alone was to my Ruin blind. He raises Trophies on my Father's Fame, Richard II. was Son to the famous Prince Edward, call'd the Black Prince, eldest Son and Heir to Edward III. who had six other Sons, William of Hatfield, Lionel Duke of Clarence, John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster, Edmund of Langly Duke of York, Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Glocester, William of Windsor. And with his Conquests wou'd adorn his Name Scarce common Praise to Edward's Deeds he'll grant, As England's Empire were deriv'd from Gaunt. The Brother Princes to his Genius bow'd, O're them advanc'd, as they above the Crowd. The Mighty Father jealous of his Son, Fear'd that his Glory wou'd eclipse his own. So early forward in persuit of Fame, He left the Rival King, and won the Dame. The Brothers follow'd with unequal Pace, The next but lagging in the noble Chase. The first in Valour he, by Birth the first, But Gaunt, tho' not the latest, yet the worst. Vile as I am, the Conqu'ring Edward's Son. Still more than Lancaster's, deserves the Throne. Were England grateful, I had kept my Crown, Or for my Father's merit, or my own. His Name the Terror of the Gallick Field. Made Armies fly, and hostile Cities yield. Princes and Kings he led in triumph home, Edward the Black Prince took John King of France, and brought him Prisoner to London, where he dy'd in the Savoy; he was not call'd the Black Prince for his Complexion, but the Terror of his Arms. Like the first Cæsars to Imperial Rome, But soon for England, and for me too soon, The Glory vanish'd that so brightly shone. Him, future Ages, like another Mars, Shall write a God, and place among the Stars. While none will think that I from Edward came, Or not his Son, or if his Son, his Shame. So late exalted, we are sunk sunk so low, What wretch will deign to look upon us now. Their Envy once, their Pity we are grown, Tho' few will pity one that lost a Crown. Betray'd, despis'd, imprison'd and forsook, All fly from us, and run to Bullingbrook. Such as we lov'd are from their Posts displac'd, And such as lov'd us, in his Court disgrac'd. He rules the Realm with Arbitrary Sway, The People chose him, and they must obey. He tramples on our Laws, our Acts repeals, In the first Parliament which Henry IV. held after Richard's abdication, all the Laws were repeal'd, which Richard's Pensioners had made in the Session of the 20th. of Richard II. which was call'd the Wicked Parliament. Happy for all Lovers of English Liberty, if Men out of Place and Favour could not creep into that Honourable House, to promote Faction and Discontent, under the specious Pretence of serving their Country, a Party more Infamous even than those who for private Interest only, promote Publick Good. And ev'ry thing's a Statute that he wills. His own Illegal Title to maintain. He leaves no Records of the former Reign. Thus wretchedly deprest, I bear the weight, Of publick Infamy, and common Hate. Whatever he inflicts, I must endure, And never was so Rich, as now I'm Poor. In Want abandon'd, and in Chains I lie, But have not Courage, tho' I wish to die. I'll take the Counsel I from you receive, Who know too much to bid me Hope or Live. For when our Troubles are beyond Relief, Comfort can't lessen, but increases Grief. To find a better Fortune, I despair, And what is past my Hope, is past my Care, The Pow'rs above unmindful of our Woes, Scarce humble us so much, as raise our Foes. Never, Oh! never be my Wrongs forgot, But curse their Children while the Traytors rot. Curst be the Crown the Tyrant Her'ford wears. Wet with his Sons and with his Mother's Tears. The Rebel Peircys will with horror see, The Treasons punish'd they have dealt to me. Their Pride, the same pernicious ways persue, For, who have once been false, will ne'er be true. No more, my Queen! No more my Griefs bewail, The Wound's too great for Pity now to heal. Sickness, Old Age, a Prison and Despair, Will take the Life which I preserve by fear. For you a better Fate remains in store, On that look forward, and on mine no more. EPISTLE VI. Queen Katharine Dowager of the Victorious King Henry V. seeing Owen Tudor, a Welsh Gentleman, and one of her Wardrobe, at a Ball at Windsor, she was so charm'd with his Person and Dancing, that ever after, her Love for him increas'd, till she contriv'd to marry him, and this Letter is the Discovery of her Passion, which she believ'd he never wou'd have perceiv'd without it, nor dar'd to think of, unless she incourag'd him; a very welcome Message to one of his Fortune, who, to be sure, was not long in doubt how to reply to such a favourable Epistle. Queen Katharine to Owen Tudor. If for my Tudor, I my Birth forget, The Pride of Majesty and quit my State. He can't, but with Ingratitude, reprove, My forward Passion, and triumphant Love. At last my Grandeur yields to my Desires, Which force me to reveal the latent Fires. Confession shou'd 'n his Contempt create, 'Tis less my weakness, Tudor! than my Fate. Immortal Phœbus, and Imperial Jove, Like me descended from their Seats above. A Satyr this, and that a Clown appear'd, Lov'd in those Shapes, as in their other fear'd. To turn the Wheel Alcides did submit, And never was before so truly Great. Thy Sov'reign crown'd with Laurels was to me, A Suppliant once, as I am now to thee. With equal Passion I return'd his Love, And as I prov'd to him, to thee will prove. Our Vows were constant, and our Hearts sincere, I dear to him, as he to me was dear. Tho' Fierce, yet Lovely, he at first appear'd, And I grew fond of him, whom most I fear'd: I met him kindled with the Heat of War, As Mars, as dreadful, and as Cupid, fair. To force my Heart the King by Conquest strove, Mine are the softer Arguments of Love. Thee, I beheld amid our rural Sport, The gayest Youth that ever grac'd a Court. Victorious both, by different Charms you please, He rough in War, as thou art mild in Peace. To thee the Monarch must for Courtship yeild, To him, my Tudor, in the dusty Field. Still his bright Image in his Arms I see, And miss it only when I think on thee. I shar'd the Glory that my Hero won, The Fame of Conquest, and a double Crown. Henry V. and his Queen Katharine, were own'd as King and Queen of France, during the Life of the French King Charles VI. Henry was by agreement, to be stil'd Peer of France, and after Charles's Death to have the Crown entirely. A weight too heavy for his Son to bear, In nothing but the Name, his Father's Heir. In the rude Noise of Battles and Alarms, At Troye the King possest my youthful Charms. At Troye in Champaigne, King Henry V. marri'd his Queen Katharine. The Foes, in these, the price of Peace agree, As now they're made, the price of Love in thee. I seek not Wealth, three Kingdoms in my Pow'r, 'Twere Avarice indeed to covet more. Whoe're will Gold to honest Love prefer, But Cheats herself, and Buys a Wedding dear. If I were fond of Titles, there are none More like to please Ambition than my own. And Kings who most cou'd flatter, this desire In vain, to what I offer thee, aspire. Ambition once did all my Soul employ, A Tyrant Passion, and unfit for Joy; Love, gentle Love possesses now my Breast, A kinder Mistress and a milder Guest. My Passion I with pain have long conceal'd, If not too plainly yet too late reveal'd. Dishonest Wishes shou'd remain obscure, Mine the severest Censure will endure. I love, and will not with my Pride debate, But tell the Youth that he may bless his Fate. I boast not that my Father wore a Crown, She was Daughter to Charles VI. Sister to Charles VII. French Kings, Wife to Henry V. Mother to Henry VI. Kings of England. A King my Husband, and a King my Son. My Brother too a King might make me vain, But having thee they shall unenvy'd reign. And how will this the Line of Gaunt abuse? Our House has sure as much as theirs to lose. Henry V. Son of Henry IV. Son of John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster. Both Bourbon and Lorrain are Names as great, As fam'd in Story as Plantagenet. From whence do these pretend such mighty Odds? Are those deriv'd from Men? and these from Gods? Are these the Offspring of the Sun and Moon? And if they wed below the Stars, undone? All Gods and Demi Gods, a heav'nly Race! And less than Goddesses their Bed disgrace. So Jealous of their Honour they appear, As only theirs deserv'd a Princess care: So much they think I've got by Henry's Crown, I've little worth the keeping of my own. Of Charles's Name I might alike be proud, And talk as high of his Illustrious Blood. Yet Charles and Henry are the same to me, Of nothing fond, of nothing proud, but thee. The British Princes found the way to please, John's beauteous Daughter, and brave Edward's Niece. Llewellin ap Jotwith, marri'd Joan, Daughter to King John, a very beautiful Princess. Llewellin ap Griffith, marri'd Elnor. Daughter to Simon Monfort Earl of Leicester, and Cousin to Edward I. they were both Princes of Wales. They boast their Camilet and Arthur's Race, And Challenge at the Lists the foremost place. Camilet, the ancient Palace of King Arthur, whose Knights were most of this Country, according to the Fable. Tho' England's Monarchs have usurp'd their Pow'r, Who conquer'd them, they conquer'd oft before, And dy'd the British Plains with Saxon Gore. Rufus, a vain and bloody War begun, William Rufus, Son to William the Bastard, call'd the Conqueror, made two Expeditions against the Welsh, in which he lost many of the chiefest Nobility, and the best part of his Armies. The Welsh incourag'd by his ill Success, made several prosperous Incursions into England in the Reigns of this Rufus, King Henry II. King John and Edward I. To lose the Glorious Name his Father won. Profusely lavish of his Nobles Blood, Sabrina's Stream a crimson current Flood. Twice he attack'd, and beaten twice return'd, Now dreading those whom he so lately scorn'd. No more of Rufus or his Arms afraid, His weak Invasion teach 'em to invade. My Beauty Peace to bleeding France restor'd, Isabel Queen of France, and the Duke of Burgundy, brought the young Princess Katharine to King Henry, then at Melans on the River Seyne, where a Peace and his Marriage were concluded. And stopt the Fury of the Conqu'ror's Sword. In Love as mighty as he was in Arms, His Courage less subdu'd me than his Charms. Nor did I Henry to my Bed prefer, Thro' want of Choice, Necessity or Fear. A Crowd of youthful Hero's I refuse, And him because he best deserv'd me chuse. Like vulgar Things the rival Princes seem, Who look like Gods, near any one but him. The Wise, to Glouster must in Counsel yield, The Brave, to Bedford in the doubtful Field. Clarence for Piety and Valour fam'd, And York's high Worth is thro' the World proclaim'd. The greatest Princess might on Warwick Smile, On Pool or Vere, and not her Honour soil. Above 'em Henry eminently shin'd, His Mien exalted like his God-like Mind. By Nature form'd to conquer and to move, To win by Victory, or charm by Love. My Heart to him without reserve I gave, And Tudor, what his Sov'reign had, shall have. No alien Wishes shall our Peace molest, Nor Jealousie disturb thy quiet Breast. So sweet an Air is in my Lover's Face, It graces ev'ry thing he does or says. Thy Language which to some wou'd barb'rous be, Is musical, and elegant to me. The Words that once disgusted me, delight, And what seem'd savage then, is now polite. Those which in other Lips I might condemn, Looks Eloquent in thee, tho' Rude in them. As smoothly flowing from thy melting Tongue, As Attick Numbers or the Græcian Song. No artful Notes so moving, so Divine, No Speech so pleasing, as no Voice like thine. The boasted Wonders of the Thracian Lyre, Ne'er breath'd into the Soul such soft Desire. Let not the Presence of a Queen destroy A Lover's Courage, nor distract thy Joy. Such yielding Majesty thou need'st not fear, Nor ever wilt by too much daring err. A Princess loses with her Heart, her Pow'r, And Queens in Love are Women, and no more. Like these, are subject to the common Flame, The same our Wishes, and our Joys the same. The Man is little fit to serve the Fair, Who durst not when a Queen invites him, dare. I'll quit my Majesty like awful Jove, And in a gentle Form, receive my Love. The Rage, the Malice of the Crowd despise, Their Threats are impotent, and base their Lyes. To please my self, like other Women free, In nothing I delight, but pleasing thee. In this, my Tudor! I'll my Life employ, While Kings shall envy thy transporting Joy: Advanc'd above their Fury or their Hate, We'll Live and Love, and leave the rest to Fate. Owen Tudor to Queen Katharine. Your Letter I receiv'd with such Surprize, I thought my transport might delude my Eyes. In Extasie the tender Page I view, Too tender I suspected to be true. Why shou'd my Queen my honest Heart beguile? Why write, I reason'd, in so soft a Stile? The more I read, I thought it more sincere, And glorious Hope succeeded to my fear. 'Tis Love, ye Pow'rs, 'tis mighty Love I cry'd, Who tames Ambition, and who humbles Pride. My Lips with Rapture to the Seal I fixt, And as I read, a thousand Kisses mixt. My Soul cou'd scarce the boundless Joy contain, Forgot its Fears, and felt no other Pain. Thus the fond Mother meets her absent Son, Transported thus, she doubts if 'tis her own. She bathes his Bosom with her joyous Tears, She feels, and yet, to trust her Pleasure fears. 'Till waking from a Dream, she thought so sweet, She finds her Fortune is as sure as Great. From distant Wales, to Court, I never came, By Henry's Conquests tempted, or his Fame. I, ne'er pretended in the State to rise, The Courtier's Arts, and their Intrigues, despise. I ventur'd early in a Christian War, Tudor and other young Gentlemen, engag'd in a Voyage, Volunteers, in the defence of Rhodes. And shew'd for Vertue what a Youth cou'd dare. Tho' Vain and Young, a better Cause I chose, And prov'd my Valour on the Church's Foes. Nor Love, nor wild Ambition then possest My peaceful Soul, nor yet had broke my rest. I left not Cambria thro' the blind Event Of Fortune, but eternal Fate's consent. In British Merlin's sacred Books we read, Ambrose Merlin, who, as 'tis thought, gave his Name to the Town and Country of Caermarthen, his Prophecies are still extant. That Monarchs shou'd in Tudor's Line succeed. Tho' late, we see, the Prophet's words are true, And perfectly, at last, fulfil'd in you. The Fates, he said, our Helmet wou'd advance, The Arms of Tudor were three Helmets. To England's Scutcheon, and the Arms of France. The Leek, the Lily, and the Rose shou'd joyn, The Rose, the Lily, yours; the Leek is mine. As England's Queen, the blushing Rose you bear, Of France, as Daughter, you the Lily wear. Of both, the Queen, the Dowager of both, Of this by Conquest, and of that by Oath. My Hopes are tow'ring to so vast a height, By you encourag'd, and decreed by Fate. Whom shou'd our Nuptials injure or displease, We cannot err in what our Fate decrees? Who strive to daunt us by their Threats or Pow'rs, Oppose Heav'ns Pleasure, in opposing ours. You need no Pallas, nor no Juno dread, No Rival to dispute your Lover's Bed. A brighter Hellen I in you enjoy, Yet arm no Foes to fire another Troy. The fair beginnings of our Loves declare, The End will be as kind, as these are fair. With graceful measure, I like Paris danc'd, Owen Tudor Dancing before the Queen at Windsor, in a turn, not being able to recover himself, fell into her Lap, as she sat on a Stole with her Ladies about her. And haply falling by my Queen, advanc'd. So active at the Sports you might have seen, My gayety was meant, to charm the Queen. Fate works not always by the common Ways, For that which ruins some, may others raise. Whatever means he uses late or soon, The Bus'ness He designs to do, is done. Not much infected with my Nation's Vice, Where ev'ry Slave's descended from the Skies: Each vulgar Wretch his high Descent will prove, From Phœbus, Hercules, and some from Jove. My Fathers were, alas! of mortal kind, And not one God in all our Race we find. Princes and Hero's, I perhaps, may bring, And Knights whose Deeds our ancient Poets sing. To grace my Birth, from Arthur I might prove, Your Tudor came, but what is Birth in Love? Oft in their Songs our British Bards repeat, Cadwallader, and Leoline the Great. Cadwallader, the last King of the Britains, descended, says Jeoffrey of Monmouth, from a Race of Trojans, to whom an Angel, if you'll believe the Historian, appear'd, commanding him to go to Rome to Pope Sergius, where he died. Eucon and Theodore are often sung, Encon was slain by the Rebels of Gwenland, he was a famous Person in his days, was Father to Theodore, of whom descended the Princes of South-Wales. And fair Gwinellian from whom I sprung. Guenellian, Daughter of Rees ap Griffith ap Theodore, Prince of South-Wales, marry'd Edmund Vaughan, Ancestor to Owen Tudor, at least this Geneolagy was found out after his Posterity came to the Crown. Lewellin, call'd Leolinus Magnus, Prince of North-Wales. In long Succession they have reign'd in Wales, Nor is it Fable, nor Romantick Tales. Yet this I do not to deserve you plead, But only by your Goodness must succeed. Tho' who will search into our ancient Line, And proud Plantagenet's compare with mine: Will see that Fortune in our Cause appears, Much more to ours indebted than to theirs. This, as a Prince, with Modesty I boast, He stiles himself, a Prince descended from Prince Theodore. A Prince, whose Name, as well as Pow'r is lost. On what we were, I will no more look back, But what my Queen shall make me now reflect. In me my Country's Honour shall revive, And in our future Sons her Glory live. Her Fame shall spread, and be by all confest, To French nor English now no more a Jest. The Welsh defeated the English at Scroggen-Castle near Offa's Dyke in Henry II. time, yet the English by a strange dexterity, turn'd the name of Scroggen, to a word of reproach for the Welchmen, which they purchas'd with honour. Ungrateful to us, they forget how well, The Dane, the Swede and Saxon we repel: They both were Conquer'd by a forein Host, We kept our Liberty, when theirs was lost. No alien Phrases in our Speech intrude, Which since 'tis uncorrupt, they fancy rude. If theirs so elegant, so rich are grown, 'Tis more with borrow'd Beauties than their own, Those marks of Slavery we scorn to bear, I need not observe that the Welsh are the remains of the Britains, which the Picts, Saxons and Danes drove into that corner of the Isle where they now inhabit, and have preserv'd their Language. Nor wou'd to be polite, their Fetters wear. The treacherous Saxon ne'er prevail'd in Wales, Nor once unpunish'd past the British Pales. The swelling Severn and our holy Dee, We fix'd our Bounds, and were within 'em free. From Brute, or whom the Fable Brutus names, Her Rise our Nation, and Precedence claims. The Rage of all Invaders we have stood, The sacred Remnant of the Trojan Blood. With this Content we never wou'd advance, Our Fame by vexing, or subduing France. Like Henry we as easily had won, Another Kingdom, as have kept our own. Our Valour equal, tho' our Numbers less, Our Courage suffers not from our Success. This tedious Story I too long persue, Since nothing but my Love can merit you. Fly swift, ye Minutes! like my Wishes fly, To my Queen bring me, and begin my Joy. Forgive my Youth, my Lover's Hopes forgive, For Hopes so daring, must be fed to live. Oh! when, as often I reflect how mean, How low I am my self, how high my Queen: A King, how little worthy to succeed, And rival Monarchs for your Royal Bed: What Pains unutterable then I feel, 'Tis worse to my tormented Soul than Hell. So poor you keep me till you grant the rest, Possest of nothing till of all possest: So many ways to lose you there appear, So few to keep you, you'll excuse my Fear: My Jealousie encreast by what I read, The Thefts of Gods, and their Deceit I dread. Suspicious of Apollo's Beams I grow, And the cool Winds which on your Beauties blow: Of fair Leucothoe and Orithea dream, And Neptune toying in a gentle Stream. Of young Erigone's unhappy Feast, When Bacchus in a Grape the Nymph carest; Tho' idle Fables, they my hopes abuse. So much I have to gain, so much to lose: Tho' less than Henry in Renown and Arms, In Tudor, you may find as pleasing Charms. Kings do not always what they promise, prove, Nor Hero's triumph in the Fields of Love: Young, kind and faithful is a Lover's worth, And more than answers what he wants in Birth: Yet like the Son of Phœbus I may strive, To guide the Chariot, which I cannot drive. My Soul, that to your Favour dares aspire, Shews, 'tis enflam'd with an immortal Fire. Forgive me, lovely Queen, if I express, My Wishes in a plain, but honest Dress: To some prevailing Passion all incline, Some darling attribute, and Love is mine. By Beauty you are famous as by Birth, By Heav'n design'd to cheer the drooping Earth. 'Tis only Love in your exalted State, Can make you still more Happy and more Great. A King might Court you with a better Grace, Might flatter better, but wou'd love you less. For who in Politicks or War excel, Are worn too much to please the Ladies well. EPISTLE VII. Elnor Cobham Dutchess of Gloucester, Wife of Humphrey, Sirnam'd the Good, Duke of Gloucester, and Protector of the Kingdom during the Minority of his Nephew King Henry VI. having been accus'd of Sorcery, and contriving the Death of the King, was condemn'd to three publick Pennances in London, and to be afterwards confin'd to the Isle of Man; which Sentence was accordingly executed. From Man she writes to Duke Humphrey this Letter; and the next is his Answer. Elnor Cobham to Duke Humphrey. You wonder who to send you this presumes, And turn, methinks, to know from whom it comes: I fear, so wretched, when my Name you see, You'll scorn the Letter in Contempt of me. What shall I do that you my plaint may hear? My Name, my very Being I'll forswear: Since 'tis so infamous, so odious grown, I will no more, by what you hate, be known: And yet, for what shou'd you confounded stand? What can you see to fright you in my Hand? You are no stranger to my Shame and Woe, Too long, too much have known, to Wonder now! From you the worst of my Misfortunes came, The Subject still, and my Complaint the same. My Letter, you believe, will blast your Sight, And read with trembling what in Tears I write. Yet these to hurt you have no secret harm, No dreadful Spell and no infernal Charm: From these, my Lord has nothing ill to fear, Whose Health and Joy I to my own prefer. A loyal Wife petitions you to read, Who brought you for her Dow'r a Virgin's Bed. Tho' Beaufort's Malice to defame my Life, Cardinal Beauford, an Enemy to this Lady, pretended she gave the Duke Philters to engage his Love. Thy Mistress makes me first, and then thy Wife. If once to lawless Studies I apply'd, I us'd no lawless means to be thy Bride: I won thee not by Trick nor Magic Charms, Nor practis'd Arts to tempt thee to my Arms: I try'd no Philters nor bewitching Draught, To force thy Love as some have weakly thought: I can no worth as Holland's Princess boast, Duke Humphrey marry'd Jacornin, Daughter to the Duke of Holland, and Wife of the Duke of Brabant, with whom Burgundy joyn'd, and made War on Duke Humphrey, who by the Sentence of the Pope, was oblig'd to return her to her first Husband. But on our Island brought no forein Host: No clam'rous Husband chac'd the flying Dame, Nor forc'd thee basely to suppress the Shame, To send her back polluted as she came: Nor Burgundy, nor Brabant claim'd thy Wife, Nor did our Spousals fill the World with Strife: No sacred Court was mov'd to make us part, For none thy Right disputed to my Heart: No fierce Commotions from our Nuptials rose, Nor Provinces attackt by neighb'ring Foes. Your Brother's Princely Consort may resign, The Duke of Bedford's Wife, was Daughter to the Duke of Burgundy, he regent of France, and Gloucester of England. Her Title to precedence here to mine. The great Protector's Wife destroys her Claim, If else I might not to that Honour aim: If by the Lustre of our ancient Race, I have no Title to so high a Place; Greenwich, once Witness of our Royal State, Sinks in our Fortunes as she rose of late. To the next Towns when I was wont to ride, The joyful Province put on all her Pride. The Silver Thames to meet my golden Barge, Swell'd his white Waves, and proudly bore the Charge. The Ships where'er the wanton Galley row'd, Hung out their chequer'd Tops, and spread their Flags abroad. Where'er I went, I like a Goddess mov'd, Ador'd by all, if not by all belov'd. How cou'd the Crowd my Ignominy see? My slavish Punishment for Love of thee. When doom'd to vulgar Penance in the Street, Vile in my Dress, and wounded in my Feet. I march'd and suffer'd, Conscious of my Wrongs, The rude Insultings of Plebeian Tongues. Where then wast thou and thy supream Command? Where then the great Protector of the Land? Of all thy Brother Princes, stil'd the Good, More famous for thy Vertue than thy Blood. For, who of all Heroic Edward's Line, Descended from Edward III. by John of Gaunt. Has kept his Fame so uncorrupt as thine? Who else next Henry shou'd the Realms advance, To Guide this Empire and to Bridle France? Rayner's proud Daughter must be fetch'd in hast, To our Dishonour on the Throne be plac'd, And Main and Anjou on the Beggar cast. In vain thou labour'st with incessant Toil, With a fair Heiress to enrich our Isle. There's nothing worthy in Arminiack seen, The Princess of Arminiac, whom the Duke of Gloucester wou'd have marry'd to his Nephew, but Pooll Duke of Suffolk mannag'd him so well, as to get him to take his Friend Margaret, Daughter to the Poor King of Sicily. Since Pool will have his Darling made a Queen. By this the Minion is become so great, To rival Princes in their Pow'r and State. To rule these Realms with arbitrary Sway, And govern those he shou'd himself obey. Why, when the Ocean bore him, were his Sails Swoln gently out with mild Etesian Gales? Why, when he brought her, did the Winds restrain Their Rage, and curl with sportive Waves the Main? Why did not Lightnings blast, and Thunder roar, And angry Tempest dash 'em on the shoar? E're she arriv'd to wast with lavish hand, On worthless Slaves, the Riches of the Land. What Henry conquer'd, and what Bedford kept, By Rayner's griping Poverty is swept. The Queens whom we have fetch'd from distant shores, With forein Treasures have encreas'd our Stores, Which to our Coffers vast Revenues brings, The Life of Subjects, and the Strength of Kings. Which animates the Soldier best to fight, And best supports us to maintain our Right. She brought us Ruin for a Royal Dow'r, And sinking in our Fortunes, sunk us low'r. Yet from her always I receive most Wrong, And suffer most from her malicious Tongue. Witch, Beldam, Sorc'ress are her common Words, The civil'st Names which she on me affords. Oh, for her sake that I a Sorc'ress were, By Day to plague her, and by Night to scare! Her Face with cank'ring Scratches I wou'd tear, Or with mysterious Knots bewitch her Hair: By Night unseen, lie heavy on her Breast, Break her soft Slumbers and distract her Rest: Or pinch her tender Skin, with fairy Pains, Which holds her wanton Blood in azure Veins: Or take some other more familiar Shape, That my just Vengeance she might ne'er escape: Were I her Robe that I her Flesh might hurt, With fiercer Poyson than Alcides Shirt: The Venom thro' her Veins I wou'd distil, And her whole Frame with wild Destruction fill: Were I a Flow'r that wou'd her Smell invite, Soft to the Touch, and tempting to the Sight; I'd strike with pestilential Fumes her Brain, Till she grew mad like me, and rav'd with Pain. 'Tis said, the Druids once possess'd this Isle, Mona, the place of my unjust exile; Whose pow'rful Charms prodigious Wonders wrought, As Doctrine worshipt, and as Science taught. Oh, that to me they had their Spells resign'd! Which rais'd and husht whene'er they pleas'd the Wind: The Moon affrighted trembled in her Sphere, With Horror heard their Voice and shrunk with fear: Cou'd I like these destroy the Plowman's Seed, Or bane the Flocks as on the Down they feed. Infernal Spirits nurse with Infant Blood, Waft thro' the Air, or o're the briny Flood, Had I this Knowledge that by time is lost, I wou'd still haunt her like an injur'd Ghost. O pardon, pardon, my ungovern'd Tongue! What Woman can endure such mighty Wrong? The Heav'ns, as nearer she approach'd our Land, Seem'd to forbid her to defile the Strand. Blue Lightning flasht amain, and Thunder roar'd, And England's Genius her Descent abhor'd: Earth quak'd, and twice the Thames kept back his Tide, Reluctant to behold her on his side; Pauls shook with Tempests, and her mounting Spire, Blaz'd out with ghastly Flames and aireal Fire; Our stately Buildings from their Base were torn, Flung down, or were aloft by Whirl-winds born; The Storm, the Image of her mind, these Ills, Prophetick to the Woe our Kingdom feells. Oh! blame me not, for when I durst not speak, My Heart is ready with the Load to break; I, whose Degree was lately near the Throne, Am now a Vagabond, an out-cast grown; No shining Robes my wretched Limbs adorn, Wrapt in a Mantle, and expos'd to scorn: My Presence once cou'd strike the Crowd with aw, Whose Suff'rings scarce can their Compassion draw: Abroad I seldom venture, but by Night, Grown noxious, like an Owl, to human Sight; In Clifts of Rocks, or in a dampy Cell, In Caves, the Confines of the Grave, I dwell; My Eyes in which my Lord such pleasure took, Each youthful Grace, and ev'ry cheerful Look; Are early banisht thence by Care and Pain, And haggar'd Wrinkles in their place remain: Like Rings of Gold my Locks but lately shin'd, Their Curl the Frolick of the gamesom Wind; Now like a Gorgon's, my dishevel'd Hair Hangs o'er my Back, and whom it charm'd, wou'd scare; My Breasts no more like snowy Hills appear, The Loves are seen no more, nor Graces there; My Skin with loathsom Jaundice is o'er grown, To thee, nor to my self, I cou'd no more be known; So much of all that's lovely, I'm bereft, The Ruins of a Beauty scarce are left; To think how Happy I was once, and Fair, How wretched now, and how I thence despair: When I reflect on what I once cou'd boast, And what of Pow'r and of Command I've lost: I rave with Madness like Tartarian Priests, Or Nymphs of Bacchus at their frantick Feasts: On Beauford may Egyptian Plagues descend, That Prelate, rather I shou'd call him Fiend; There's something in his Name methinks so foul, Forgive me Heav'n, 'tis Poyson to my Soul; The Traytor, he, who when my Cause was heard, Of all my Judges, most my Foe appear'd; Not suffer'd in my own Defence to plead, Invented Mischiefs to my Charge he laid; That I to Bullinbrook's Designs agreed, Bullingbrook and Southwell, convicted with the Duchess of Sorcery. And by my Presence justify'd the Deed; That I assisted at their Magick Rites, Convers'd with Goblins and familiar Sprights; That Southwell was by my procurement won, And all by Beauford's watchful Cunning known. Why shou'd the Bastard be allow'd to vaunt Himself descended of the famous Gaunt? Who gave him out of Charity his Name, To hide the Foundling and his Parents shame: For if Report of ancient Times be true, He ne'er his Father nor his Mother knew: For this he practis'd Murder on his Son, By Henry's Death, to seize on Henry's Throne. By him a bold Assassin was convey'd, And near the Royal Bed in ambush laid: The Victor Prince had perish'd by his Sword, Had not a Dog more faithful sav'd his Lord: The Cardinal was accus'd of endeavouring to get Henry V. assassinated, and 'tis said, a Dog in the King's Chamber discover'd the Murderer. The Queen, the Prelate and her Minion Pooll, The King and Kingdom at their pleasure Rule: Among their Fav'rites they our Wealth divide, And all too little to maintain their Pride: The King does nothing but the Name enjoy, His States these govern, and will soon destroy. Late may the Hour of our Destruction come, But 'tis too plain to doubt if we consume: May my Lord live from their Attempts secure, Tho' who is under such Protection sure? Oh, that thou wou'dst thy Glouster's Stile refuse! Some other Title and Distinction chuse: The Name, I fear, is fatal to thy House, To them as it has prov'd, 'twill prove to us: When I fore-see thy future Danger near, I often wish thee banish'd with me here: Farewel, my Lord, my last adieu receive, 'Tis all, alas! that I have left to give. Duke Humphrey to Elnor Cobham. Can I forget thee, or behold thy Fall By me unpity'd, tho' 'twas wish'd by all? Swifter than Shades our fleeting Pleasure flies, But Grief is sooner born, and later dyes. Such cruel Thoughts of me thou wou'dst suppress, If thou cou'dst judge Impartial in Distress. In all thy Trouble I have had my share, Thy Wrongs are mine, thy Shame and thy Despair. How was I struck when Fame and Envy spread That Elnor, guilty, was from Justice fled. Of black Designs and hellish Arts accus'd, By Onlye and the Witch of Eye abus'd. That for the King's Destruction she conbin'd, With invocated Fiends in Counsel joyn'd. Were Henry wasted by a Magick Fire, And melting by degrees shou'd thus expire. As in his Picture he consum'd away, His Person shou'd insensibly decay. This pierc'd my Soul, and I for thee began By fear, to find I was no more than Man. Were the Wounds heal'd which for thy Wrongs I feel, Thine might continue to afflict me still. But how can I, from all Infection free, Forget thy Sorrow while I think on thee? When thou art hurt, can I be free from Pain? Or shoud'st thou by thy self the mighty Load sustain? My Soul for light Afflictions has no room, Compleatly wretched I'm by thine become. Tho' absent, thy Misfortunes rack my Mind, Thy Shame, tho' thou art gone, remains behind. Tho' from thy Husband thou art forc'd to part, Thy mournful Image never leaves his Heart. No Eyes bewail, none pity our Distress, Our Grief the more, howe'er, our Debt the less. The Crowds good Wishes are from us estrang'd, Their changing Love is with our Fortune chang'd. A Fate which ne'er shou'd disappoint the Wise, They court the Happy, but the rest despise. What cou'd so far thy wild resentment move? Again to charge me with a forein Love? To former Ills 'tis time to bid adieu, We find enough to plague us in the New. Have not I tenderly thy Usage mourn'd? And thy Complaints with mutual plaints return'd? Did I unkindly in this hour forbear, For Sigh to answer Sigh, and Tear for Tear? Or seeming unconcern'd did I neglect, Those Signs of Love, your Sex so much affect? Cou'd any guess or by my Dress or Mien, My Thoughts were undisturb'd, my Heart serene? Did none discover when, or how I griev'd? Nor in my Looks, my Discontent perceiv'd? Is this your Quarrel with me you shou'd know, No troubles are so strong as silent Wo. If in my Breast unutter'd they remain, They are still there, and still I live in pain: Affliction by Concealment is increas'd, It lessens when exprest, when known, 'tis eas'd. What of her Wealth to me has England lent? Examine what she has receiv'd or spent. Like her true Son, I have obedient prov'd, Yet am I, tell me, like a Son belov'd? A spurious Offspring must my Rival be, Set up to stand between the Throne and me. Must I with him my Priviledge dispute, The Realms shall judge it, and his Plea confute. Is Wisdom mighty oft, when Force is weak, Let France, how much she owes my Counsels speak? Cravant, Vernoyl and Egincourt can tell, Three famous Battles fought in France, Duke Humphrey, a great Counsellor in this Expedition. How by my Conduct there, her Armies fell. If Faith deserves, my Title must succeed, Who kept the Crown on Harry's Infant Head. Henry Beauford Cardinal of Winchester receiv'd the Hat at Calais, against the Command of his Nephew King Henry V. If I can merit by a Patriot's Cares, My Youth cou'd early shew her Silver Hairs. Am I made Glorious by the Peoples Fame, With the best Honours they adorn my Name? If Plots discover'd and incessant Toil, Declare that I have lov'd or serv'd our Isle. If happy Embassies my worth enlarge, None better did the Trust, or cou'd discharge. For me, if England, wou'd all Europe hear, She wou'd not Beaufort's purple Robe prefer. Rome's Pardons shou'd no more our Gold devour, Nor o'er the Kings the Priest advance his Pow'r. He shou'd no Taxes on the People lay, Nor they Contribute what the Church shou'd pay. Whate'er he says, his ghostly Councils aim, To ruin ours, and set up Langly's claim. The House of Cambridge descended from Edmund Langly Duke of York, a younger Brother to John of Gaunt; they claim'd the Crown by another Title, from Lionel of Clarence, an elder Brother of the Duke of Lancaster. He leads young Henry in unwholsome ways, To raise the House of York, his own betrays: We from the Blood of Lancaster descend, From Cambridge, they, tho' Clarence they pretend. Strange, that himself from mighty Gaunt deriv'd, Shou'd wish his Children of their Right depriv'd. From Henry, Cambridge wou'd the Crown have torn, And snatcht the Laurels by my Father worn. With Grey and Scrope he secret Treasons laid, To murder Her'ford, and his Rights invade. From March and Mortimer he boasts his Line, Whom Glendour aided in their bold Design. With him and Percy for the Crown declar'd, And the divided Realm in equal Portions shar'd. This Beauford knows, and to embroil the State, Wou'd fain revive our Houses ancient Hate. Stern Mowbray by the Priest will be restor'd, An ancient Grudge between the Houses of Lancaster and Norfolk, since Mowbray Duke of Norfolk was banish'd for the Accusation of Henry Duke of Her'ford afterwards King Henry IV. To raise new Tumults, and insult his Lord. No Time nor Distance can his humour change, But still on Her'ford's Race he vows Revenge. 'Twas Beauford freed our Pris'ner from his Bands, James Stuart King of Scotland, being Pris'ner in England, marry'd the Cardinal's Niece, Daughter to John Duke of Somerset, he broke his Oath and became a great Enemy to England. And put our Princess into faithless Hands. Whose Husband for her dow'r attacks our Coast, And gains by Treaty what by Arms he lost. The Queen and Suffolk, Henry's Empire guide, By Beauford's Head their Policy supply'd. He sooths the Queen in her advancing Pooll, Proud, under them, that he's allow'd to rule. Why shou'd I talk to thee of her or him? Thy self my Care, thy Sorrows are my Theam. England and thou, divide my Loyal Heart, And scarce I know which holds the greater part. Or thou, or England, which shall I prefer, You both are to my anxious Soul so dear: In thee and England, I this Difference find, England's ungrateful, and my Elnor kind. Yet justly, tho' my Country I reprove, For England I too oft neglect my Love. Still art thou Elnor to my Heart as dear, As when I saw thee first, and still thou seem'st fair. When with the Pride of Youth thou wert array'd, And in thy Eyes the Loves and Graces play'd. When thy fresh Beauties most amaz'd my Sight, And I possest thee with supream Delight. Tho' Time and Anguish have decreas'd their Store, Enough remains, and I desire no more. The worst of Malice, like thy self, endure, Thou ne'er canst be but in dejection Poor. A while for better Days preserve thy Life, A Princess thou art still, and still my Wife. Let not thy Eyes by looking high renew Thy Grief, but such as are below thee view. The Great, whom Fortune flatters with Command, Shall soon with us upon the level stand. We have the dismal, they the gladsom Hours, And when it pleases Heav'n, they shall be ours. We weep, and they may have a time to mourn, Whom now despise us, we in time may scorn. Woes in extreams are too severe to last, And worse we need not fear than what is past. These Hopes, the wretched in Disgrace, attend, That when Despair is at the worst, 'twill mend. Cou'd I by bearing all, thy Pains relieve, I only, cou'dst thou be content, wou'd grieve. Cou'dst thou to me the pond'rous Weight resign, The Burthen of thy Sorrow shou'd be mine, Till the thick Clouds that o'er our Fortunes low'r, Blow off, and we again resume our Pow'r. And now, methinks, a beam of Hope is seen, Our Sea grows gentle, and our Sky serene. Thro' the black Tempest I perceive a Ray Of Light, the happy Pledge of future Day. Hence gloomy Thoughts for ever! Hence Despair! And let our Love be mutual as our Care. In Solitude and Peace let Elnor rest, Till Heav'n again shall smile, and we again be blest. EPISTLE VIII. William de la Pooll Duke of Suffolk, procures a Match between King Henry VI. and Margaret Daughter of Rayner King of Sicily and Jerusalem, to whom the Provinces of Man, Anjou and Maine, were deliver'd on a Treaty concluded by the Duke of Suffolk, for which Treason, the Duke was banish'd by the means of the Earl of Warwick, at a Parliament held at Leicester. From France this Epistle is suppos'd to be sent to Queen Margaret from William de la Pooll, and the next is her Answer. William de la Pooll Duke of Suffolk to Queen Margaret. Let not my Mistress my Misfortune share, And I with Patience will my Exile bear. Five rowling Years on nimble Wings wou'd fly, Like Lover's minutes, if my Queen were by. When thou art absent, 'tis Eternal Night, And Banishment Eternal from thy Sight. The Persians who adore the rising Day, Cou'd they see thee, to thee wou'd Worship pay. Thy Eyes excel the Sun's meridian Light, Their Force as piercing, and their Rays as bright. Their rival Beams with Wonder he surveys, And in his rapid Course, to view thee, stays. England a Prison wou'd without thee be, And ev'ry Region curst alike to me. Who cou'd to Bonds the Generous Pooll confine? What Chains can I submit to wear, but thine. We, like the Falcons, no restraint endure, Nor stoop, like vulgar Birds, to ev'ry Lure. The Duke of Suffolk gave a Faulcon for his Arms, his Family was but new, and originally Citizens of London, from whom many of our present Nobility are deriv'd, tho' they have taught the inferior Quality to look on the most useful, and consequently the noble part of the Commonwealth, as a worthless scoundrel sort of People, below their Acquaintance or Conversation; in this our Fops and Wits are much wiser that Machiavell, who was of a quite different Opinion, and thought none of value in a State, that was not serviceable to it. With wanton Wings in open Air they play, And ne'er descend, but when they seize their Prey. Live where we will, our Dwelling is the same, We view one Heav'n, and tread one earthly Frame. No Exile to the Brave can be assign'd, Nor with the Body is the Soul confin'd. Man in himself a little World contains A Soul not subject or to Bonds or Chains. Wheree'er his Body by constraint may be, His Soul superior to their Force is free. Who such Injustice, and be Calm, can bear, The worst of Fortune has no need to fear. At Leicester, Warwick my Disgrace contriv'd, The States by him, and perjur'd Slaves deceiv'd. Me they accus'd for yielding up of Main, To me they charge the Loss of Aquitain. By this, he feign wou'd win the Peoples Fame, And be the Heir of good Duke Humphrey's Name. My spotless Honour he abus'd with Lies, That o'er the Pooll, the Nevil Race may rise. He joyn'd in Counsel with his haughty Sire, Nevil Earl of Salibury. In York's stern Breast to kindle latent Fire. By Clarence Title, aiming to supplant, The Claims of Henry from the Famous Gaunt. The Rout with fair Pretences he beguil'd, And I, to please the Rabble, am exil'd. Revenge my Good old Lord! the Traytor cry'd, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester suppos'd to be murther'd by the Queen, and Pool's procurement. Revenge! the People and his Friends reply'd. Tho' worn with Age the Fav'rite Duke deceas'd, Yet I must suffer, and the Mob be pleas'd. If they wou'd know who rob'd him of his Life, From Man, they only need recal his Wife. Meaning Elnor Cobham Duchess of Gloucester, banish'd to the Isle of Man for Sorcery. She, who in high Procession march'd along, With flaming Wax, and penitential Song. Let her again perform her Magic Rites, And summon to her Aid, infernal Sprights. From Hell, her Ministers must rise again, To tell how Humphrey dy'd, and who shall reign. Full Twenty Years in Gallick Plains I fought, The Duke of Suffolk on the Duke of Bedford's Death, was made Leiutenant-General in France, the Lords Talbot, Scales and Willoughby, being joyn'd with him. And Charles and Orleans to the Combat brought. Charles VII. King of France. Amid the thickest of the War I prest, And offer'd to the Foe my Loyal Breast. I saw the Havock of Vernoylas Fields, With the Slain cover'd, and abandon'd Shields, I saw Great Bedford thro' the Host advance, And England triumph o'er dejected France. The Marks of honourable Wounds I wear, Where most was Danger, I was always there. With me Great Montacute and Talbot fought, By my Example and Instruction taught. Fierce Heats, and piercing Colds I have sustain'd. In England's Service, early Laurels gain'd. The French to Forts and Cities I persu'd, I sackt their Towns, and dy'd their Streets with Blood. For this, from England, I reproach receive, And banisht, in the Lands I conquer'd, live. For thee, thou know'st, the fairest I refus'd, And, only thee, to be my Princess chus'd. The Treaty for Arminiack was begun, I put her off, and plac'd thee on the Throne. To see thee oft, and that my Queen might reign, I gave thy Father Anjou, Mans and Main. His Daughter for her Dow'r her Beauties brought, Whose Treasures were too Cheap by Empires bought. Before Aumarl, I left my conqu'ring Arms, To tell my Sovereign of thy wond'rous Charms. At Tours Ambassadors of Peace I find, A Peace negotiated there by the mediation of several Kings between England and France. Who su'd in vain till Love and Suffolk join'd. My Tongue to praise thee was by Love inspir'd, Young Henry heard, and with the Tale was fir'd. With pow'rful Eloquence thy Charms I drew, And set thee Glorious to the Monarh's view. The King transported and confounded stood, While I with Extasie the Theam pursu'd. I prais'd thy Modesty, thy ev'ry Grace, The Beauties of thy Mind and of thy Face. Soft from my Tongue the moving Accents fell, I, pleas'd to speak, and he to hear as well. To us, I said, thou wou'dst new Glory bring, Heiress of Sicily and Naples King. Titular King only. Then of his Pow'r and of his Kingdoms sung, As if his Daughter from a God were sprung. With pompous Epithetes his Stile I grac'd, And Rayner with the first of Monarchs plac'd. Thus to advance thee in the King's Esteem, And dear to me, to make thee dear to him. How much I lov'd was in thy Nuptials seen, In Henry's Name when I espous'd the Queen. The Proxy shone in an Imperial Gown. Of equal Value with thy Father's Crown. The Realms were tax'd, and I with lavish hand, A fifteenth granted by the Parliament to fetch over the Queen. Consum'd the Wealth of our empoverish'd Land. To honour thee I on my Prince bestow'd, My dearest Blessing, and my greatest Good. Belov'd and Loving, I with Joy cou'd quit, The Darling of my Heart, to make thee Great. Had Jason, who adventur'd for the Prize, As Poets sing, beheld thy sparkling Eyes, And seen thee, such as on the Gallick Shoar, The ravish'd Youth had left the worthless Oar. With open Arms the Royal Maid to seize, A richer Treasure than the Golden Fleece. The Coasts of Diep were throng'd with weeping Crowds, Who mourn'd to leave thee on the briny Floods. The wanton Tide around thy Vessel play'd, Old Ocean smil'd to see the heav'nly Maid. Her silken Pride thy Ship display'd abroad. And gamesom o'er the silver Waves she rode. Sportive the Sea, as when Imperial Jove, Bore thro' the yielding Waves his trembling Love. The watry Nymphs their Harps divinely strung, While sweet Arion on his Dolphin sung. His Head fierce Neptune from his Palace rear'd, And grimly pleasant with his Troop appear'd. Before their King the Gods marine advanc'd, While o'er the Waves th' immortal Lover danc'd. Thus the proud Element to thee was kind, To thee, in whom, all Beauty is confin'd. Thou Pride of Nature, whom the Winds obey'd, Fond of thy Smiles, and of thy Frowns afraid. To Banishment, 'tis said, thy Pooll is gone, France is his Prison, where his Fame he won. A glorious Exile, this, my Queen, for me, Where daily I the Fields of Conquest see. The happy Plains with Pleasure I survey, Where Gallia lost, and England got the Day. Forth, here, the Vanguard mighty Bedford led, Here Talbot charg'd, and here the French-men fled. Scales and his Archers, there methinks appear, And famous Willoughby again is there. Again the Squadrons combating I view, And now the Gallick fly, and ours pursue. For what we cannot help we mourn in vain, In all our Griefs, 'tis useless to complain. Nor Sighs, nor Sorrows can our Pains relieve, For then we suffer most, when most we grieve. As mortal Men we're fated to endure, Incessant Cares, and only this is sure. The Laws Eternal, and the Pow'r we serve, From what he once decrees, can never swerve. We fondly prize what soon will fly away, And cannot promise to our selves a Day. Too oft we idly boast what we intend, Forgetting our Designs on Heav'n depend. What Fate has destin'd, only shall be done, Which nor our Wisdom, nor our Strength can shun. To the King's Will I must my Life resign, The Pow'r is his, my Honour still is mine. Courage, fair Queen, and let thy Looks declare, No shew of Fear, not token of Despair. Such as I saw thee at the Gallick Court, She embarkt at Diep, and landed near Southampton. Such as thou look'st, when we approacht the Port, Where Henry waited on the crowded Strand, And took his Royal Bride from Suffolk's hand. New Graces then the youthful Queen adorn, Blushing and Smiling as the Orient Morn. With Rapture Henry seiz'd the Glorious Prey, And bore thee in triumphant Pomp away. Thus Gay, thus Happy may'st thou always be, Nor dream of Danger for thy self or me. Queen Margaret to William de la Pool. Sweet as the Nightingal's nocturnal Song, To Pooll, my words came slowing from my Tongue. Soft on his Ear the charming Accents fell, Which now are dismal, like the Passing-Bell. My Breast was once the Sovereign Seat of Joy. No Fears cou'd then my perfect Bliss annoy. To Grief a Stranger and unus'd to care, 'Twas hard to learn the Lesson of Despair. A vast and desert Wilderness 'tis grown, Like the cold Regions of the frigid Zone. Where, in the Air, the Icie Mountains rise, And seem to threaten their unfriendly Skies. No beams of Light the horrid Natives cheer, For all is Darkness and Confusion there. Thus in my Soul no dawn of hope I see, But Clouds impending o'er my Love and me. Our Day no more is Smiling and Serene, And glaring Meteors in our Sky are seen. For past Delights we only now must mourn, Lament the Summer which will ne'er return. As on Autumnal Boughs we often hear, The Birds bemoaning the departing Year. Tho' they again will have a time to sing, Salute the Morn, and welcom in the Spring. Our time is past and we must Joy no more, But curse the Season which we blest before. Now to our Aid, who stirs the Neighb'ring Kings, Or, who from France a pow'rful Army brings? Who moves the Norman in our Cause to joyn, Philip Duke of Burgundy, a great Friend to the House of Lancaster. Or Burgundy to own the Royal Line? The Lords in the North withstood the Duke of York at his first Rising, and twice overthrew him. Who in the North our lawful Claim commends? Supports our Credit there, and gains us Friends? To whom shall I my secret Griefs impart? To whom disclose the anguish of my Heart? Since Pooll is gone, on whom I cou'd depend, The bravest Hero, and the truest Friend. Nature on thee was lavish of her Store, She gave so much, she cou'd not give thee more. Of so Divine, so Rich a Temper wrought, In thee, scarce Envy cou'd perceive a Fault. The King knew well thy Rhet'rick wou'd succeed, Who can resist when such as Suffolk plead? All Force against thy Eloquence is weak, Thy Eyes, thy Air, and ev'ry Action speak. Had'st thou been living when immortal Jove, His Heav'n abandon'd, and on Earth made Love. No Shape but thine, the God had deign'd to wear, For none cou'd be so Happy, none so Fair. To Henry, York unfeign'd Allegiance swore, The Duke of York on the Death of King Henry V. and Henry VIth's. Coronation, took the Oath of Allegiance to him. Unfeign'd he call'd it, but he feigns no more. The Vail thrown off, the haughty Duke appears, In perjur'd Arms, and raises impious Wars. By this his Treasons and his Guilt compleat, Who breaks his Oath, will any Crime commit. His Title to the Crown of late's proclaim'd, To which, tho' secretly, he long has aim'd. His Consort to her Sons the Tale repeats, As Heirs of England, she the Princes greets. The one of Wales, the next of York is stil'd, And Henry's Right by odious Names revil'd. We need no breach in the Succession fear, The latest of the Brood will make an Heir. Richard, unshapen in his Limbs and Mind, The Duke of York had four Sons. Richard Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard III. was the youngest, born with Teeth, and very unshapen. The Scandal of his Nation, and his Kind. His Mother's Picture, and her lasting Shame, Abortive to the World, the Monster came. The Womb unwilling, he for Passage tears, And shews the Nurse his tusks and bristled Hairs, The cruel promise of his future Years. Who now, when York shall Henry's Arms oppose, Will scourge the Rebels, and chastise our Foes? Who clear the Garden of its noxious Weeds, And crush the Vermin which of late it breeds. Who chain the Bear, or chase him from the Wood, The Earl of Warwick's Arms was the white Bear rampant, with the Ragged-Staff. Give the Lands Peace, and save the Peoples Blood. Before his Foes the wretched King falls down, And humbly stoops, that they may take his Crown: While, like a tow'ring Cedar he shou'd rear, His top aloft, and shoot it in the Air. His sacred Head shou'd mingle with the Clouds, While these vile Shrubs sit lowly in his Shrouds. Oh! why shou'd he enjoy his Father's Right? A stranger to his Courage and his Might. Sure Nature lavisht all her genial Fire, To form a perfect Hero in his Sire. No spark remain'd to animate the Son, And make him worthy of his Father's Throne. The noble Beast begets a noble Breed, And Fools in Man alone the Wise succeed. The Coward to the Hero's Race a shame, Springs from his Manly Loyns, and stains his Name. For me the Daizy was by Princes worn, The Courtiers in honour of the Queen us'd to wear a Daizy, which in French is call'd Margarite. Which lies neglected or expos'd to scorn. York's Garlands now on ev'ry Head is seen, And all forsake their Monarch and their Queen. The Rebel rises fast as we decline, Our Sun begins to set, and his to shine. A dreadful Comet in our Sky appears, And Warwick's Staves are our malignant Stars. The Knees which bended to my Glories low, Grow Stiff, as if they had forgot to bow. I hear the Shoutings of the Crowd no more, Who curse me loudly, as they blest before. When Fame shall to our Foes thy Doom report, We both shall be their Laughter and their Sport. But when it spreads along the Western Coast, How in our Wrongs will Glouster's Widow boast. She soon will strive to be recall'd from Man, To plot and practice hellish Arts again. To this proud Warwick will, I know, agree, In spight of Marg'ret, and in hate of thee. That in our Court she may my Birth disgrace, Abuse my Father, and affront our Race. She thinks this most will vex my haughty Mind, And I no help in Suffolk's absence find. From the old Stock, 'tis said, new Branches bloom, And Kent presents you for a King, a Groom. Jack Cade, a Kentish Rebel, pretended to be descended from Mortimer, by Philippa the Duke of Clarence his Daughter. The Man, the Faction to the Crown prefer, As Mortimer and Philip's rightful Heir. Thus Cade, a vulgar Rebel is become, A Prince, whom York wou'd put in Henry's room. In this we know the Traytor's higher aim, To see what Numbers will support his Claim. While he abroad usurps supream Command, His Imps raise Tumults to disturb the Land. To Ireland he our bravest Soldiers draws, The Duke of York then Deputy of Ireland. That Henry naked, he may gain his Cause. Still to encrease the burthen of my Woe, Great Winchester is gone, where all must go. Beauford, the Pillar of the Church and State, Cardinal Beauford, a Favourite of the Queen's. Submits, as thou and I must do to Fate. Next the wild Fury of the People fall, Edmund Duke of Somerset, hated for his ill Fortune in France. On Edmund, whom the Rout a Coward call. His Wisdom and his Valour they defame, And him, who sav'd their batter'd Armies, blame. Duke Humphrey's Friends, and his inveterate Spouse, Revive the ancient Quarrel with our House. Wheree'er they go, they breath aloud revenge, Their Malice growing as their Fortunes change. While ours deprest, your Sentence is their Sport, And Buckingham alone remains at Court. Humphrey Duke of Buckingham, of the Queen's Faction. By Love, I here conjure thee, Pooll, beware Of Seas and Tempests, for thy Fate is there. A Witch foretold, the Deep shou'd be thy Grave, May Heav'n avert it, and our Suffolk save. Yet oft in Visions I my Love behold, Lie breathless on the Beech, and stiff with Cold. Oft view thee driving on the stormy Main, I wake with fear, and dread to sleep again. Oft see thee there in horrid Combat joyn'd, With Pyrats, Billows, and the raging Wind. O'er all Victorious thou dost oft appear, Yet still be cautious, and accept my Care. Think me not weak that I this Counsel send, She loves not much, who fears not for her Friend. Whene'er we grieve we must our Griefs express, Cou'd we hope more, our Sorrow wou'd be less. The Storm that threatens to involve us o'er, Heav'n still may land us on a peaceful Shore. Still hope in Triumph thou may'st yet return, Again we may rejoyce, tho' now we mourn. But hope for ever is from us withdrawn, Through the thick Clouds our Day will never dawn. While Pool is gone, my Portion is Despair, I ne'er can hope till I have Suffolk here. The End of the First Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPISTLES, PART II. EPISTLE I. Mrs. Shore being represented to King Edward the Fourth as a great Beauty, he takes an Occasion to see her privately, falls in Love with her, sends her the following Letter, and receives an Answer from her agreeable to his Wishes. She was the Wife of a Goldsmith and Banker in Lombardstreet. King Edward the IV. to Mrs. Jane Shore. Edward to Thee, the fairest of thy Kind, This Letter sends, the Image of his Mind; Oh! that to ease me of the Pains I feel, I ne'er had seen thee, or cou'd see thee still. So much my Eyes to gaze on thine delight, 'Tis Death to be a Minute from thy sight; Must vile Mechanicks have so rich a Prize, And Sots possess the Treasures of thy Eyes? My Love to live among the Base shou'd scorn, Whose Beauties wou'd the gayest Court adorn. When with thy Story I was first surpriz'd, I thought it Fable and the Tale despis'd: But when the bright Original I saw, I found no Fancy cou'd thy Picture draw; No Colours paint a Beauty so Divine, Nor Words express such Excellence as thine. Struck with the full Perfection of thy Charms, I rav'd to think Thee in another's Arms. Careless of Joy, he takes Thee to his Breast, By him but half belov'd, and half caress'd. Who, more than stupid Fools, does Fortune bless? For while the Miser sleeps his Stores increase. If in a common Dress Thou look'st so fair, How glorious woud'st Thou in a Queens appear? Till cut and set in Gold the Diamond seems Like Pebbles rowling in the Crystal Streams. But polisht like Celestial Orbs they shine, Whose Lustre only is excell'd by Thine. Thou sleep'st but coarsely on a vulgar Bed, I Tyrian Carpets o'er thy limbs will spread. In Purple, wrought with Orient Pearl and Gold, The wondring Crowd my Mistress shall behold. When in Disguise to see Thee first I came, My Crown abandon'd, and my Kingly Name; I saw thy Husband, he the Monarch view'd, Ask'd me to buy, and said his Wares were good. A Casket of his Jewels he produc'd, I lik'd them all, yet all by turns refus'd; Another Casket then he made me see, Yet hid his richest in reserving thee. I wanted nor his Jewels nor his Gold, Nor came to purchase what a Banker sold. Cou'd he a Sapphire to thy Veins compare, Or had an Agat like thy Blushes fair; Had he a Diamond which like thee did shine, Whate'er it cost, the Treasure shou'd be mine: If not my Purse, my Crown shou'd be the price, For Crowns are worthless in a Lover's Eyes. How fond of forein Trifles are we grown, We praise their Wonders and neglect our own; The Tuscan Villa's, and the Lombard Fields, While bounteous England better Prospects yields. In vain their Poets of their Seasons sing, In thee alone we find perpetual Spring; In vain the Merchant brings us Syrian Gums, Thy Breath is sweeter than his best Perfumes. Hence let the Mariner his Toil give o'er, Nor sweep the amber Seas nor search the Shoar; Thy Lips more sweets than Indian Groves dispense, Thou Charmer of the Soul and Joy of Sense. The Crystal brought us from the Northern Sea Is less transparent, and looks dull to Thee: France gives us Fashions, and imports her Toys, To flatter Women, and divert our Boys. The Mode is best directed by thy Dress, For none, unless they copy Thee, can please; On Thee the meanest things appear with Grace, So much thy Garments borrow from thy Face. A Fool, thy Husband, to expose his Ware, When thou outshining all his Gold art there; Thy Charms our Wishes, and our Looks engross, And in thy Presence, we despise his dross. The Golden Tresses which adorn thy Head, In worth the value of a Mint exceed; Well may my Love contemn the studious Fools, Who seek the great Elixir in their Schools. The Artist in its search, in vain grows poor, In vain the Chymist melts the pretious Ore; Their Studies, and their Wealth, in Smoke ascend, In Folly they begin, in Ruin end. The powerful Change is by thy Touches made, And Gold converted from impurest Lead; Free from allay, it wants no Chymick Fires, And more Correction, than the Flame, requires. Let artful Odours be by others us'd, All Sweetness is, where'er thou breath'st, diffus'd; All Senses find in Thee enough to feast, And scarce we can distinguish what is best. Perfection is in all, to Smell, to See, To Hear with Rapture, we must live with Thee; Softer thy Voice, than when the Warblers sing On blooming Trees, to welcome in the Spring. Whiter than Milk, thy Skin, or Alpine Snow, Or Lilies which in Eastern Vallies grow; We only thee can to thy self compare, For nothing else in Nature is so fair. A Thousand Eyes at envious Night repine, And wish for Day, that they may gaze on thine; All other Objects they with Pride disdain, And Light without thee, is to them a Pain. No Heart so strong, as can thy Charms withstand, The fair, who rule our Eyes, our Souls command; The Preachers in the Pulpit censure Love, But what their Doctrine damns, their Lives approve. For Wealth the Merchants plow the watry main, On wanton Wives to lavish what they gain The Sages oft the search of Wisdom leave, And sweeter Comforts from your Sex receive. The Hero arms, and rushes to the War, That courting Glory he may win the fair. What tho the Pleader for his Client fails, The Fees he gave him with the Nymph prevails; No Peasant, no Plebeian Wretch so mean, But hugs his Lass, and thinks his Wench a Queen: Both Prince and People still agree in this, Their Wishes are the same, the same their Bliss; Thee for their Theme Apollo's Sons shall choose, Thy self a Goddess to inspire the Muse; Soft be their Numbers, and their Sense be strong, And equal to my Passion be their Song. Let 'em on thee their Eloquence employ, Lead thee to Pity first, and then to Joy: No more let Artists Observations raise From Stars, of windy Nights and stormy Days; No more presage the Promise of the Year From Heavens kind Aspect or an angry Star: Vain Studies these, and their Prediction lies To cheat the foolish, and amuse the wise, But Fate's Decrees are certain in thy Eyes. No more of Rules and Circles let 'em speak, Their Proofs are false, and demonstrations weak: In Thee alone we just Proportion find, A Symmetry of Body and of Mind: Our Wits on Thee may shew their utmost skill In Praise and Picture yet be wanting still. With Envy from the East the Sun surveys A Mortal shining with Superior Rays, He blushes at his weakness, and would fain Restore the Night, and sink in Shades again: His Golden Carpet he unwilling spreads, And jealous Glories on his Rival sheds. We seldom see those Objects with delight, By Custom made familiar to the sight. The Persian Monarch when he rides abroad But rarely seen, is worshipt like a God, While those who common to their Slaves are made, So little are ador'd, they're scarce obey'd. Thou shou'dst not be expos'd to publick view, So much respect to Edward's Love is due. At Court, the Mistress of the King shou'd shine In brightness that may more resemble thine, Where to divert thee, England's Youth shall meet, Dispute the Prize, and lay it at thy Feet. The vile Embraces of a Subject scorn, To nobler Joys, and royal Honours born; Which State becomes thee best, thou soon wilt prove, And soon distinguish who deserv'd thy Love. Away with Fears, which may my Hopes destroy: What we both wish for, let us both enjoy. In Love, 'tis fatal to dispute the Field, The wisest there, are such as soonest yield. My Crown, my Heart, my Freedom I resign, All that I have, or that I can, is thine; This on a King's Imperial Word receive, And what I give with Joy, with Joy receive. Mrs. Jane Shore to King Edward the Fourth. When Boys accustom'd to the Mothers Wing, Practise the Lute, and first attempt to sing, Their Fingers tremble, and imperfect Notes, Through doubt of pleasing, strain their Infant Throats; They dread the Musick of their Master's Ear, And tune their Voices and their Strings with fear. My Hand thus conscious of my Weakness shakes, And Blots, where I intended Letters, makes; Oh! had I ne'er this tempting City known. Nor the gay Pleasures of a wealthy Town. Had I with Shepherds in the Woods been bred, To watch the Flocks that on the Mountains fed; I, unobserv'd, and Innocent, and Poor, Had kept my Vertue and my Peace secure, Who now expos'd to every Tongue and Eye, Shine like a Meteor in an angry Sky. Oft I have heard my Beauty prais'd before, Content to gaze, they never wisht for more. A Prince more curious each Perfection sees, Those Charms transport him which can others please: The Conquest glorious, but 'tis won with Cost, For what is got by Chance, is soonest lost. How am I grown so much my Sovereign's Care? Or you must be deceiv'd, or I am fair: With Pride the Beauties of the Court we name, But others seldom are oblig'd to Fame, Who sings their Wonders, who their Cheeks compares To blushing Roses, and their Eyes to Stars. The Bards will not so much the Muses wrong With vulgar Subjects, to defile their Song; Strange! that a Monarch shou'd so far mistake, As such a Choice, in such a place to make. A Thousand fairer in the Town you see, And more deserving of your Smiles than me; Where'er you move such shining Forms appear, Who left the Provinces to flourish here, That all wou'd think, to whom the sight is shewn, The Realm impoverish'd to enrich the Town: So lovely all, the meanest Nymph wou'd charm The coldest Writer, and his Fancy warm; His Genius in the Subject he might raise, And make himself immortal in her Praise. Eternal Sweets he from those Flowers may choose, No more with rural Weeds debase his Muse; In every common Hedge the Bramble grows, While only in the Garden springs the Rose. Oft pointed Satyr has attack'd our Sex, In odious Colours painted our defects; With Justice she our weakness has disclos'd, Chastis'd our Folly, and our Pride expos'd. In vain the Matron conscious of her Years, Wou'd hide her Wrinkles, and her Silver Hairs; What time has ruin'd, she in vain wou'd save. She paints, perfumes, and dresses for the Grave. She haunts indecently the Park and Plays, For while she aims to flourish, she decays. Our Youth, affected in their dress and Mien, Too fond of forein Airs and Toys have been: Nature in all their Actions they despise, And think the most ridiculous most nice. Tho gay and fine we oft the Sex behold, 'Tis borrow'd Beauty, and dissembled Gold. Yet in this Town enough of real Charms May Edward find to bless a Prince's arms. In blaming others I my self condemn, Mean and unworthy of a King's esteem; My Virgin Treasures with my Name are gone, Another's Right, and by another known. What most cou'd warm your Wishes is destroy'd, By him who first enjoy'd it, still enjoy'd; He reapt the bounteous Harvest of my Youth, As happy in my Person as my Truth. He thinks me faithful, can I wrong his trust. Or be to him, and to my self unjust? You cou'd not think but in your Suit to fail, Nor hope, when first you tempted, to prevail. A Crown wou'd dazle me, perhaps, you guess'd, And the King soon be of his Wish possest. The Rebel, Honour, you wou'd force to yield, Seize the rich Prize, and ravage all the Field. Against your Tears our Virtue is too weak, We seldom mean the angry things we speak. Too well you know we are imperfect made, And where we're most defenceless, you invade. The lucky Minute you too often find, Exert your native Power, and we are kind; You vow, you swear, and we as well believe, You weep, you sigh, you conquer and deceive: Our Humour you observe, our Will obey, And we comply as fast as you betray. The Fair, the Brown, the Slender and the Tall, The Bulky and the Short, you praise us all; Whatever Mien we use, what dress we wear, You tell us some peculiar Grace is there. Where'er we walk, like Goddesses we move, And every thing we do, confirms your Love; All ways to please us you with Care devise, Our Ears with Musick, and with Show our Eyes. But when your fatal Ends you have enjoy'd, We grow a Burthen, and you soon are cloy'd; On us ungratefully you throw the shame, Boast of our Favours, and our Frailty blame. Ovid first taught your Sex to touch the Heart, Tho Man in this has little need of Art; 'Tis rare to see a Hero us'd to reign, Descend to write in a Poetick Strain. Will Kings in Fables too their Love rehearse, And court in Similes, and woo in Verse? 'Tis pleasant sure to hear a Prince compare My Breath to Roses, and to Gold my Hair, My Eyes to Stars, to snowy Hills my Skin, Enough the Prize, without a Crown, to win. The Men who flatter us like you, we raise, And love too oft the Poet, for his Praise. Our Husbands bound our Pleasure by their Will, And fansie they've a right to use us ill; So far enslav'd when we are once subdu'd, They think they're Civil, when they are not Rude. Too well you know this Treatment is not strange, And we're too easily dispos'd to change. The Spouses Stomach with Fruition full, The Wife grows Tastless, and the Husband Dull. No Adoration to our Charms they pay, But preach, that they must rule, and Wives obey. Is this so pleasing to a Womans Ears, As when a Lover's Sighs and Vows she hears? When at her Feet the fearful Suppliant lies, And, e'er he knows his Doom, with terror dies: Whom every Touch and every Kiss transport Not sweeter to enjoy, than hear him court. Our Husbands, weary of repeated Bliss, Think they oblige us, if they deign to kiss. In their Caresses they their Pride constrain, And give unwilling, what their Wives disdain. To walk the Park, or see the Play deny'd, They dare but seldom in our Truth confide The Priest has said it, and the Mob conclude, The Stage is dang'rous, and the Poems lewd. More for our Bodies than our Souls they fear, Were they less jealous, they'd be less severe. The Comick Muse, as filthy, they reprove, The Tragick, as it teaches us to love. This the Pretence, tho what offends the Cit, Is his own Picture, and the Author's Wit: Himself the Cuckold, and his Wife the Jilt, He learns his Folly in his Consorts guilt. Not all his Care his Fortune can prevent, He sees 'tis Fate, and is at last content. In vain he hopes in Bolts to be secure, What Wife so stupid but defies a Door? Who so insipid as can Act the Spouse, Or like the nauseous Business of a House. An Ape her Pastime, and her Dog her Toy, A Sot her Lover, and her Play a Boy. To this Disease a Remedy you bring, A Sovereign Balm, the Promise of a King. We faintly struggle when a Monarch woos, We might the Man, but can't the Prince, refuse. You are the Cause that I my Husband scorn, I wish your Presence, and your Absence mourn. His loath'd Embraces I of late avoid, To be no more by one I hate, enjoy'd. For him I love the Lord of my Desires, I keep for Edward my remaining Fires. Tho nearer with my Joy my Ruin draws, 'Tis glorious Ruin when a King's the Cause. EPISTLE II. King Henry the VIII. on the Peace concluded with Lewis the XII. the French King, gives him, tho then very Old and Infirm, his youngest Sister Mary in Marriage, who before had engaged her self to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, King Henry's Favourite, and a very fine Gentleman. She had not long been marry'd to Lewis before he dy'd, being in Five Months left a Widow, and at Liberty to remember her Engagement with her beloved Duke. She sends him this Epistle, to chide him for staying after he knew of her Husband's Death, and had the King's Consent to marry her. Which he excuses in what follows. Mary the French Queen to Charles Brandon. Such Health as I implore of Heaven for me, Such Health thy Queen, my Suffolk, sends to Thee. You little think, or sure you wou'd not stay, How ill we Women can endure delay. The Winds, the Waves, are but a faint excuse, Leander did not thus his Hero use. A Royal Fleet to waft you hither, waits, The Passage narrow, as the Sestian Straits. No Fleet, no Ship, was fitted out for him, The Winds to combat, and a Sea to swim. A Princess, young as Hero, and as fair, A Queen, expects you with Impatience here. You scarce cou'd be more Negligent and Cold, Were the Sea wider, and your Mistress Old. No Beldam Nurse shall interrupt our Bliss, Nor our soft Revels be disturb'd with Spies. Tell me no more you want propitious Gales, Your Lovers Sighs, methinks should swell the Sails. Your Wishes are becalm'd, your Soul serene, Or Seas nor Winds wou'd keep you from a Queen. While raging Tempests in my Bosom reign, My Love as furious as the stormy Main. The Winds, as I have wish'd 'em to be fair, Have shifted since you promis'd to be here. The greedy Merchant never watch'd 'em more, Whose Ship expected, brings the pretious Ore, As I of thee; impatient of his gain, He vows he ne'er will venture it again. Haste, Brandon, haste, and do not dread my Frown, My Rage, as soon as Suffolk smiles, is gone. To hate you I resolve when you're away, But sure 'twill be no longer than you stay. Safe here and secret we'll our Lives enjoy, No Fears disturb us, nor Offence annoy. This, since so freely I confess, 'twill try; If Gratitude, as fast as Love can fly. The King my Brother, and his beauteous Queen, King Henry's Queen and their Court went to Dover with the Princess Mary, where she embark'd for France. The Court, in Tears, when I embark'd, were seen. To stay, what poor Excuses I invent, With Joy expected, and with Sorrow sent: I chose the latest Minute to depart, And left behind me when I went, my Heart. To Brandon early I that Treasure gave, And took the Bed of Lewis for my Grave. While many guess, tho Suffolk only knows, The cruel Reason of my Virgin Woes. I saw you weeping on the crowded Strand, And wav'd, in bidding you farewel, my Hand: Nor blush'd, to give you in the Peoples view, A sad, a tender, and my last, Adieu. The Seamen took the Signal for their Oars, And push'd the Gally from the Chalky Shoars. Then, as a Child that has in playing lost A Toy he valu'd, and which pleas'd it most; To find it he a while with Patience tries; Till seeing 'tis in vain he hides and cries. Thus to my lonesom Cabin I repair, Lament your Loss, and tell the Winds my Care. As once an Empire I refus'd for Thee, A Marriage was concluded between the Emp. Maximilian I. and K. Henry VII. for the Emperor's eldest Son Philip King of Castile, and Arch-Duke of Austria, Father to Charles V. with the Princess Mary, when they came to Age, which Agreement was broke by Henry VIII. Lewis had lost me had my Choice been free. To my first Vows thus faithful I have prov'd, And loving much, deserve to be belov'd. Tournay, your Conquest, when by Fame I heard, It pleas'd me most to see my Love prefer'd. I fancy'd I beheld him in his Pride, The Hero shining by the Monarch's side. The stately Canopy, the Tent of Gold, K. Henry at the Surrender of Tournay, made a publick Entry under a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, born by Four of the chief Citizens, the King himself mounted on a very fine Horse, and his Trapping embroidered with the Arms of England, France and Ireland. And all the Pomp of Triumph I behold. Your Praise alternative the People sing, Of Suffolk some, and others of the King. I feel your Pleasure, and your Glory share, Till a new Scene presents another Care. Castile, they tell me, is your splendid Guest, And brings his Sister to adorn the Feast. A Thousand ways to tempt you she has strove, And us'd a Thousand Arts to gain my Love. Thy gallant Youth subdues her haughty Soul; Thy Charms, what nothing else cou'd tame, controul. Your Banquets, Tournaments, your Balls, your Plays, The King treated Prince Charles of Castile, afterwards Emperor, with his Sister Margaret Dutchess of Savoy at Tournay. There was then a Discourse of a Marriage between the Dutchess of Savoy and the Lord Lisle afterwards Duke of Suffolk. Your Nights I dreaded, and your gamesome Days. Thus Cleopatra, Rome's Triumvir try'd, And thus my Brandon may be lost, I cry'd. Suspicion is the weakness of our Sex: She who loves most, believe me, most suspects. With such Offenders we with ease are Friends, He's least excusable who ne'er offends. None guess'd on Tournay, you'd pretend to look; Which, soon as you besieg'd, we heard you took. When Maximilian with my Brother joyn'd, Maximilian I. with his Troops serv'd under K. Henry, wore the Cross of St. George and the Rose on their Breasts, being both himself and his Soldiers in our King's Pay. The Kings of England have since had many Princes in the same Circumstances, as much as 'twas then a rarity. And his proud Eagle with our Crosses shin'd; Nor thought he injur'd his Imperial Name, To wait on Henry's, and his Suffolk's Fame. Both Cæsar and his Knights, with Pride, obey, Fight in his Armies, and receive his Pay. I little dreamt that I shou'd pay so dear, For all your Victories, and end the War. 'Twas Wolsey's cunning and his vile deceit, Wolsey then Bishop of Lincoln, afterward Cardinal, by his Favour with King Henry, was the chief Cause of this young Ladies being thrown away on the decrepid French King. To which, unwilling I, by Force submit; An English Princess cou'd not yet advance, My Suffolk's Fortune like a Queen of France. A Royal Dow'r, a better Wealth will prove, Than the poor Treasure of a Virgin's Love. Yet losing this, so delicate you're grown, It soils, you think, the Lustre of a Crown. Widows are things so miserably dull, Your Fancy sickens, and your Wishes cool. In this more scrupulous perhaps than wise, Your Fears are foolish, but extreamly nice. If you knew better, you wou'd shun me less, But save my Blushes, and my meaning guess. An Infant hanging on his Nurses Breast, May kiss and toy, and yet the Nurse be chast. Six Moons have scarce their Silver Circle run, Since Lewis gave me for my Hand a Crown; What the good Monarch had return'd in Love, Might more your Pity than your Envy move. Cruel indeed! Who at his Bargain grieves, Who gives so little, and so much receives. Our Loves in nothing, but Prevention, crost, My Wealth will pay for all the Minutes lost. Lewis, to grace my Nuptial Feast, invites, To Tilts and Turnaments, the Warriour Knights: The formost to the Lists my Champion came, To prove his Prowess, and assert the Dame. Valois beheld Thee with a jealous Frown, Francis then Duke of Valois, and afterwards Francis I. chose the Duke of Suffolk, and the Marquess of Dorset, to be his Assistants in the Tournaments he Proclaim'd in Honour of the Lady Mary and her Nuptials. Thy Youth so spritely, and thy Valour shone. He dreaded it too much to trust his own. And wisely conscious of unequal force, He took a kinder, and a safer, Course; Thee of his Party, and thy Friends he chose, Who dare all Combatants, and all oppose. Oh how it struck me when the Justs begun, To see the Rival Knights at Suffolk run; Your danger I beheld with such concern, Who saw me, easily my Care discern. Nor often cou'd my secret Terror hide, But, save my Brandon, save my Love, I cry'd. Then, lest Confusion might betray my Zeal, I kiss'd the good old King, and all was well. I saw the Glory which your Squadron won, The rest neglected, and extoll'd his Son: And when he turn'd his honest Praise on thee, I ask'd him, to deceive him, Which is He? Joy flush'd my Cheeks and sparkled in my Eyes, When Suffolk was proclaim'd to win the Prize. The mighty Rapture I cou'd scarce contain, And scarce from telling what I felt, refrain. My Womans Wit and Artifice I use, My Pleasure to conceal, or else excuse. My Looks on others, or my Praise I turn, Or seldom nam'd thee, or with seeming scorn. So Eminent you shin'd above the rest, As best I lov'd you, you deserv'd it best. The Knights, the Princes in their splendid Arms, Thy Valour wanted, or thy youthful Charms. Yet oft I fancy'd, I their Merit wrong, As Brave they seem, as Beautiful and Young. As Gracefully they move, as Great appear, As Worthy too, if Suffolk is not near. As Clouds before the Sun from Thee they fly, And their Worth vanishes when thou art by. So Diamonds equal in their Lustre seem, When view'd alone that look by others dim. A noble Presence in Alencon's seen, Thy Shape is better, and thy charming Mien. A fine Behaviour, Gentle and Polite, Distinguishes Vendosme, but thine is great. The Gallant Bourbon has a manly Face, Yet wants my Hero's Sweetness and its Grace. The Boaster Long'ville, Europe's Champions dare, Believ'd till Suffolk came the first in War. The famous Constable's couragious Son, The Count of St. Paul. Allows thy Glory has eclips'd his own. Bonarm and Galleas, with Gigantick Might, Two famous Combatants of their time. Gallean of such strength, that he ran a Course with a Spear, which at the Head was Five Inches square, and at the Fut Nine. Bonarm at the same time same into the Field arm'd at all points, with Ten Spears about him, and spurring his Horse never stop'd him till he had broken 'em all. Dispute the Prize, but yield to thine in Fight. If Henry with our Loves shou'd disagree, I'll own the Fault is mine, and not in Thee. My Brother's Smiles created my Esteem; In loving thee, I only follow him. The Croud believe I wrong a Royal Bed, Below a Lancaster or York to wed. So high a value on my Name they set, There's none which suits it but Plantagenet. This, in their Wisdom, I suppose, they say, Yet grieve at nothing but at Suffolk's stay. Can England please thee while thy Queen is here, Or I delight in France while thou art there? Hast, Hast, my Brandon, and expect to find An angry Mistress, yet in Anger kind. When we last parted was your Promise this? The Oath you swore, and seal'd it with a Kiss. Is this your speedy, and your wish'd Return? And are you not ungrateful and forsworn? With greater Crimes I sooner cou'd dispense, Than pardon this, a Lovers worst Offence. And yet if e'er to meet again we live, What Crime so great I shall not then forgive? Your Penance heavy, like your Sin, shou'd prove, My Vengeance shall be only too much Love. Yes, Brandon, this is all thou hast to fear, If Love can be too much, thou'lt have it here. Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, to Mary the French Queen. VVhen you accuse me that I stay too long, My Love, forgetting where I am, you wrong. Nor Seas, nor Wind detain me in a Port, But the slow Motions of your Brother's Court. Impatient of my last Dispatch I wait, And curse the Ministers, and blame the State. The King commands 'em, and they promise fair, Yet artfully contrive to keep me here. If nothing but the Winds oppos'd my way, Thou shou'dst not chide me for my tedious stay. Nor Night, nor Tempest wou'd I fear for Thee, But cut my Passage through the troubled Sea. Your Eyes wou'd light me o'er the darksome way, And Love, your Suffolk, on a Wave, convey, Swift as my Wishes to my Queen I'd fly, Nor dread the Billows tho they reach'd the Sky. My Hopes wou'd mount me yet above their Rage, While I, undaunted, with the Storm engage. The Sun just finishes the Golden Year, My Queen at Paris still, and Brandon here. Still parted by our Foes, or by our Fate, Our Loves must suffer, by the Forms of State. Your Truth, your Constancy, you oft repeat, Yet, great as 'tis, your Suffolk's is as great. In Pompous Embassy, when Longville came, The Duke of Longville Ambassador on this Occasion. To wed the Princess in his Master's Name. Oh! how I wish'd we might dispute in Fight, If Lewis shou'd possess my Lover's Right. To rash Attempts provok'd by my Despair, I meditate his Death to save the Fair. The Powers which kept me from so black a Deed, Forgive the Sins that from our Love proceed. For who cou'd see with Temper, and unmov'd, The Beauty ravish'd he so dearly lov'd? Richmond the Glory of our Silver Thames, Wild and Deserted, in your Absence, seems. 'Twas there, you know it well, you stole my Heart; 'Twas there, in Tears, you told me, we must part. There I beheld you at your Rural Sport, The Grace, the Wonder, of a shining Court. Oft like Diana, on the flowry Green, Queen Katharine, whom Henry VIII. afterwards divorc'd. You revel'd with your Brother's beauteous Queen. The Birds, in Winter, at your presence sing, And fancy, when they see you, 'tis the Spring. The Groves, the Shades, the Meads, while you was there, Preserv'd their Sweetness thro' the smiling Year. The Spring, the Birds, with you are fled away, And scarce are heard to welcome in the May. The Thames complaining, with his Murmur glides, Or rages in his Grief, with swelling Tides. He sees the Goddess by his side no more, Nor bears the Burthen which he proudly bore. To meet you coming from the Shoar, he heaves, And lifts you gently on his wanton Waves. The Swains, by Wonder, to the Banks are led, The Flocks, the Herds, which near the River fed, From the green Pasture, from the Mountain stray'd, And the gay Swan, around your Gally, play'd. The Stream unwilling, now his Course pursues, And nothing lovely, since you left him, views. When Fame inform'd me of the Storm you met, The Queen in her Passage to France was met by a great Storm, which drove the Yacht or Vessel she was in, into the Haven of Bulloign, and scatter'd the Fleet. Which tore your Gally, and dispers'd your Fleet. I knew from whence the dreadful Tempest rose, How Venus made the Warring Winds your foes. She loath'd to see so bright a Princess led, A Youthful Victim, to an useless Bed. The Winds, to please her, all their Rage employ, That, what she cou'd not gain, she might destroy. Your Ships, with fury, on the Coast she drove, In Vengeance to her self, and slighted Love. The God ne'er governs by the Rule of State, Nor Cruel to the Mean, nor Partial to the Great But when a fond, a tender Heart he finds, He aims his Dart, and whom he pleases, joyns He Curses such, as what he Wills, oppose, And certain Ruin with his Curses goes. How for your Safety shou'd I once have pray'd Of the least Wind, of every Wave afraid! Yet thus to leave me, with my Joy so near, Too much provok'd me to increase my Care. Till Love returning, and with Love my Zeal, I heard, with Transport, that the Queen was well. Of your gay Meeting we were quickly told, King Lewis XII. her Husband then very old, met her at Abbeville, where he made with his new Queen a most pompous Entry. The Bride Conspicuous, in her Gems and Gold Your Charms more radiant than your Gem appear, Like a new Star, to deck the Southern Sphere Your Virgin Train in Silver Robes are seen, The Queen had 36 Ladies clad in Cloth of Silver, the chiefest of the English Nobility, the Trappings of their Horses were of Crimson Velvet. O'er all Illustrious, but the lovely Queen. Whose Brightness, as unequal seem'd to theirs, As the Sun's Lustre to the paler Stars. Is all this Splendour for a Child, I cry'd, King Lewis besides his Age, was much troubled with the Gout. 'Tis less to shew his Kindness than his Pride. Himself Decrepid and Decay'd, he strove To please thy Vanity, if not thy Love. Of his rich Trappings, and his Steed, they talk, As if he shou'd not ride, who cou'd not walk! A fine Companion for a Royal Maid, For a Grave fitter, than a Marriage Bed. He sought thy Beauty, as the Miser's Gold, To hoard the Treasure up, and to behold. Fond to Possess, uncapable to Use: Yet loath to keep it, as he fear'd to lose. With Hands profane, the Beauty so Divine, 'Tis Sacrilege to touch the hallow'd Shrine. Thy Youth on him was thrown away in wast, Who surfeited on Food he cou'd not tast. And yet, like Children, who for Trifles long, He covets still, as if he still were young. When Capel, Dorset, and the Valiant Grays, The Duke of Suffolk when the Torunament was proclaimed in England to be held at Paris, for the sake of the Queen his Mistress, got the King's leave to go thither, with whom went Gray, Marquis of Dorset, and his Four Brothers, the Lord Clinton, Sir Edward Nevill, Sir Giles Capell, Thomas Cheyney, as his Assistants. In search of Glory, crost the narrow Seas. As Knights they went, Companions of my Fame, To try their Force, and spread the English Name. In Triumph to the Lists, I saw you ride, The Entry of that Queen into Paris, after her Coronation at St. Dennis. And proud was Brandon, to behold your Pride. Paris around with Tyrian Carpets hung, The Court with Joy, with Mirth the City rung. A Numerous, and a Gallant Band prepar'd, Attend in shining Armour, as your Guard. In high Procession, follow'd next the Priests, Array'd in Purple, and in Golden Vests: Their Vows they mingled with the Joyful Throng, And sung your Praise, and Hymeneal Song. The Princes of the Church, the Peers of France, The Dukes of Alenson, Bourbon, Vendome, Longueville, Suffolk, and five Cardinals. With the Bride's Champions, in their Rank advance. Aloft, on your Imperial Chariot, born, Your Seat, you Honour, and your Crown adorn. To shine, your Ladies, an unhappy Train, Like Stars too near the Sun, attempt in vain. Their Youth, their Vanity, their Care and Cost, So near Perfection, in the Queen, are lost. Affected in their Airs, and nice in Dress, While Native Beauties, in their Mistress, please. Thus the bright Cynthia from the West appears, Attended with a Troop of feeble Stars; She rules the Skies, with undisputed right, Confest their Sovereign, and the Queen of Light. Secure of Conquest, to the Lists I ride, For what of Might I want, my Love supply'd. Thrice at the Barriers I your Charms proclaim, And enter'd fierce to justifie your Fame. The Knights, to name the Rival Ladies, dread, And, as the Fair deserv'd it, they succeed. I prov'd Triumphant in your Royal View, O'r them superior; to their Ladies, you. Nor Arms your Suffolk, nor their Spite, compell'd, To quit Inglorious, the disputed Field, The German boasted of Gigantick Race, The Duke of Valois, afterwards Francis I. French King, envying the Duke of Suffolk's Fortune and Bravery, got a German of prodigious Strength, to encounter with the victorious Brandon, who closing with this boasted Champion, beat him with the Pummel of his Sword, till the Giant had enough of the Combat. Tho brought in Treason for your Knight's Disgrace, I forc'd, you saw it and were pleas'd, to yield, And offer'd at your Feet, his Massy Shield. Forgive—if recent Actions I repeat, Or talk of things you cannot yet forget. My Fame, my Fortune, to your Smiles are due, And all that I have got, returns to you. From your bright Image in my Soul it came, And Love and Victory were then the same. By every Motion, by my Eyes you guess, To what I ow'd my Courage and Success. This, had the People leisure, they might see; But gaze on you too much to look on me. Thus, unobserv'd, our Glances often joyn'd, Mine fierce with Wishes, as the Queens were kind. Again enflam'd, the Combat I pursue, Defy'd the Champions, and again subdue. 'Twere vain of Pedigree, or Birth to boast, The Thames, the Tyber, in the Sea are lost. The Monarch Eagle, o'er the Faulcon flies, In view, he leaves him, and ascends the Skies. Your self the fairest of a Race Divine, What Merit can I hope to plead by mine? Or else as Heir to Brandon I might claim, Sir William Brandon's Father was slain at Bosworth Fight, by Richard III, being then Standard-bearer to the Earl of Richmond, afterwards Henry VII. A Prince's favour in my Father's Name. Whom Richmond chose, at Bosworth Plain, to bear His Glorious Ensign, and direct the War. The Tyrant's Cause and Person he withstood, And bought our Honours with his Loyal Blood. Blame me no longer for unkind delay, Nor think thro Coldness or Neglect I stay. Our Council's slow, I fain would have 'em sure, Prevent all Danger, and our Hopes secure. We'll trust to Fortune, and to Friends no more, By both once flatter'd, and betray'd before. The King's Consent his Council must approve, And all that follows will be Joy and Love. EPISTLE III. The Earl of Surrey, famous in the Reign of Henry the VIII. for his Muse and his Valour, was very much in Love with the Lady Giraldine, of the Family of Fitzgerald in Ireland, and being in his Travels at Florence, where the Giraldi gave him Reason to remember his Lady, and the Name they had given her, as by some is imagin'd, he sends this Letter to comfort her in his Absence, and the Lady Giraldine's Answer is the next following. Henry Howard Earl of Surrey to the Lady Giraldine. From Florence, whence the brave Giraldi came, The Family of that Giraldi are now one of the most Noble in Florence; that the Lady Giraldine was descended from them, my Lord Surrey sings himself, and that she was born in Ireland. From Tuscan came my Ladies worthy Race, Fair Florence was sometimes her ancient Seat; The Western Isle whose pleasant Shoar doth face, White Cambers Cliffs did give her lively heat. A Race of Heroes, and my Love from them; I send this rude Epistle to Thee, the Fair, With more Sincerity compos'd, than Care. The Tuscan Eloquence I shall not wrong, The Tuscan Language thought the purest in Italy, whence the Proverb Lingua Toscana in bocca Romana. To speak my Wishes in my Native Tongue. Tho fine their Language, Gallant and Polite, My Passion like my own, is Fierce and Great. Near the Nine Sisters and the sacred Spring, Where Virgil, and where Ovid, learnt to sing; In English Numbers I, to write t'you, choose, The Lover English, and the same the Muse. The Tuscan Sweetness if she wants, we boast The Roman Majesty, which they have lost; Her Grace, perhaps her Affectation, less, She wears a Modest, but a Noble, Dress. When e'er she mounts, above their height she flies, And soars sublimely to her Native Skies; Of Heroes, Demi-Gods, and War, she sings, Of Europe Conquer'd, and of Captive Kings. She leads our Princes thro' the dusty Field, And shews the Battle won, and Town compell'd; But when she pleases to descend to Love, And paint the Shepherd in the Myrtle-Grove. So soft her Notes, so moving are her Strains, The Virgin pities, as the Youth complains. Oh wou'd she now her duteous Son inspire, To kindle in your Soul the same Desire, Which burns in mine an unconsuming Fire. No want of Grace wou'd in the Stile appear, Nor Tuscan Eloquence with mine compare. Love, conq'ring Love, in every Page shou'd shine, And your kind Wishes grow as warm as mine. My Grief, my Joy, Impatience, Hope and Fear, What here torments me, you wou'd suffer there, Share in my Pleasures, and divide my Care. You then wou'd know how dreadful 'tis to part, And ease by Pity, my afflicted Heart. Think with what Pain I left my native Shoar, For England troubled, for your Absence more. With trembling I beheld a friendly Gale, Swell out our Canvass, and present to sail. You saw me driving from the Coast to Sea, And weeping, I believ'd, you wept for me. In tears, the Fortunes of our Love I mourn, Nor quite departed wou'd to Land return; The Winds, the cruel Waves, their Aid deny'd, And drove me forward with a furious Tide. The Port again I bid the Sailors make, And pray the rising Winds to force us back. The Winds, the Mariners, refuse to hear, Laugh at my Sorrow which they took for Fear. Not the proud Monuments of ancient Rome, Invited me to leave my Love and Home; Her pleasant Villas, and Campanian Fields; Nor the rich Banquets that her Vintage yields. Nor the gay Spirit which inspir'd their Souls, When her Wits revell'd o'er Falernian Bowls, Cou'd tempt thy Lover from his Prince and Thee, With Storms to Combat, and a dangerous Sea. But Glory urg'd me to assert by Arms, My Truth unequal'd, and Thy Sov'rein Charms; To Florence, Fame, the daring Champion draws, Where Fortune prov'd as friendly as my Cause. Cou'd Love, by Distance or by Time, decline, A Thousand Accidents had ruin'd mine: Books, Schools, and what in Learning I admire. Had cur'd my Passion, and had quench'd Desire. But their grave Maxims I of late despise, And think, To Love, is only to be Wise. Divine Erasmus, and our famous More, Who taught, improv'd me, and who Charm'd before. Their Wisdom and their Eloquence wou'd seem, But when they talk of Love, A barren Theme! I went from Belgia to the Knightly War, And left the Sages with their Precepts there. I crost the Danube and the Rhine to view, The Court Imperial, and my Course pursue. I met the great Agrippa there renown'd, This Fiction might have been spar'd, but Mr. Drayton's Excuse may serve for me, that he us'd his Invention the more freely, as writing in the Person of a Poet. For Magic Science, and for Arts profound. I ask'd him, by his mighty Skill, to see, The distant Maid, and how it far'd with Thee. Strange to believe! he in a Glass disclos'd, The Lovely Scene, and all thy Charms expos'd. As once I saw thee on a Bed reclin'd, Thro the white Lawn, thy whiter Beauties shin'd, I gaze with Rapture on thy matchless Face, And beg'd him never to remove his Glass. He shew'd Thee reading, and the Numerous Line, Discover'd in his Glass, I saw was mine. Of Love it sung, and I beheld the Maid With Blushes, and, I thought, with Pleasure, read. The wondrous Artist I with Joy embrac'd, And sure of Victory, to Florence past. I boast no Honours from a Noble Name, My Father's Glory or from Surrey's Fame. The Lyon shining in our Arms I wave, The Earl of Surrey was a Hero as well as a Poet, had a Silver Lyon added to his Arms, for the Victory he gloriously obtained over James V. King of the Scots at Bramston near Flodden-Hill, being a part of the Cheviot Mountains, the most noted of the North. For Clowns can fight, and ev'ry Fool be brave. Tho Flodden-Field will never be forgot, Nor Surrey Conq'ring, nor the routed Scot. With Heroes, I might claim the foremost Place, By my own Actions, or my Warriour Race. Another Title to your Love I plead, Which sooner, with the Gallant, shou'd succeed. The Son of Phœbus, and the Sacred Nine, My Name Illustrious, and my Works Divine. My Soul enlighten'd with a Heavenly Ray, Derives its Being from the God of Day. Not the least worthy of the Tuneful Throng, Your Beauties are immortal in my Song. The Fair with Pleasure, what I write, rehearse, And Kings repeat my never dying Verse; These the best Trophies, to my Name, I raise, And wear the Laurel, but to grace the Bays. In ample Synod when the Gods design, To raise a Being, like themselves, Divine. The frame dispos'd, a Spirit they infuse, Which forms a Hero, or creates a Muse. A Smaller Portion of Ætherial Fire, The Croud of Heroes, and of Kings inspire, The Muse they quicken with a purer Flame, To give, as he deserves, the Monarch Fame. The World had ne'er of great Achilles rung, Nor Hellen's Rape, had Homer never sung; Time wou'd his Valour, and her Charms destroy, Or both had perish'd in the Flames of Troy. For Slaves and Kings are equal in the Grave, The same in Death, the Coward and the Brave; Till with new Honours by the Muse they live, And in the Fable, or the Scene, revive. She adds by Fiction to their real Worth, And makes 'em Gods, Who were but Men on Earth. The Son of Thetis, and the Spartan Dame, Were less in Nature, than they are in Fame But the bright Image of your living Face, No Art can paint, nor Eloquence express. Such are the Graces of your Wit and Youth, The Muses Fiction cannot reach the Truth. A perfect Picture, who pretends to make, From Thee his Features, and his Fire, must take. Yet these, Alas! so Lovely and so Gay, With Age will wrinkle, and with Time decay, You'll curse the Change, and wishing to be young, Seek the lost Graces in the living Song. Nor Time, nor Age, my Picture shall consume, Your Youth will there be ever in its bloom. There, tho imperfect, shall your Image last, The Lady Stanhope was a great Beauty as he himself has recorded in the Verses, he writ on her refusing to dance with him, under the allegory of the Lyon and the Wolf; a little extraordinary, 'tis true, to compare the Lady to a Wolf, but no matter, his Reasons will be seen best in his Writing. Himself. A Lyon saw I late as white as any Snow. Her. I might perceive a Wolf white as a Whale's bone. A fairer Beast of Fresher Hue, beheld I never none, But that her Looks were Coy, and froward was her Grace. And future Beauties envy like the past. Stanhope, the Wonder of the courtly Train, O'er Thee no longer shou'd unjustly reign. To Thine, her Titles, and her Conquests, yield, If equal to the Fair my Verse excell'd. By Arms I'll vindicate thy Sovereign Right, Or prove by Numbers, if I lose by Might. For this Apollo will my Breast inspire, And kindle in my Soul the latent Fire. Then shall my Genius, like the Subject shine, My Song be Deathless, as the Theme Divine. Wyat the Charmer of your Sex, with me, Sir Thomas Wyat translated the Psalms of David, of which the Earl says somewhere; What Holy Grave, what worthy Sepulchre, To Wyat's Psalms shall Christians purchase there! The Hero and Poet did not think the Translation of David so despicable an attempt, as a late modern Bard has often express'd it. 'Tis the ill Performance, and not the Design of those who have pretended to't that is most faulty. On Sir Thomas's Death he writes, What Virtues rare were temper'd in thy Breast, Honour, that England such a Jewel bred; And kiss'd the Ground whereas thy Corps did rest. Shall tune his Harp, and sing again for Thee. To late Posterity thy Fame shall run, While by thy Merit, we exalt our own. The Prince, when Surrey at his Court appear'd, The Great Duke. Proclaim'd the Tournaments, and Lists prepar'd. A golden Pillar in the Cirque was plac'd, With different Portraits, and Devices, grac'd. Yours, with Amazement, and Delight, they view, And destin'd, e'er the Fight, the Prize to you. The Spurs, the Lance, my Silver Lyon, held, Beneath your Picture, and defy'd the Fair. When prancing on a Barb I first appear, Approach the Pillar, and pronounce Thee Fair. The Trumpets sounded, and with loud acclaim, The Croud approve it, and admire the Dame; The Knights, defy'd, the sturdy Lance prepare. Assert their Mistresses, and bid the War. From ev'ry Nation they to Florence come, From Europe, Africk, and from Asia, some, To lose their Honour, and their Love at home. Dismounted, at my Feet, the Champions lie, And curse their Fortune, and demand to die. The Trumpets sound, and Clamours rend the Skies, When Surrey is proclaim'd to win the Prize. The Court, the Sentence of the Field, allow'd, And Truth Eternal, to the Fair I vow'd. A Pile erected in the Rising Flame, I cast an Offering to your sacred Name, The Broken Spears, the Trophies of my Fame. To Heaven it mounts, a bright Ætherial Fire. Pure as my Love, and fierce as my Desire. I bless the Omen, and my Vows renew, The Custom of the Knights who won the Prize of Chivalry, to take an Oath to be true to their Dames, as here describ'd. To Sing, to Combat, and to love for you. Nor Balls divert me, nor the splendid Feast, Their Sights, their Musick, and their Praise displeas'd; And pensive, to my Chamber, I repair, And meditate alone, the distant Fair. My Wandring Thoughts on various Objects rove, On Hunsdon, Hamoton, but they meet in Love. Of Hunsdon he says, and of Hampton Court and the rest, Hunsdon did first present her to mine Eye. Of Hampton Court and Windsor, where abound. All Pleasures. The Lady Giraldine was in the Service of Queen Katherine. Hampton me taught to wish her first for mine. Windsor Alas! doth chase me from her fight. When Windsor Walls sustain'd my wearied Arm; My Hand, my Chin, to ease my restless Head. With a King's Son my Childless Years I past. In greater Feasts than Priam's Son of Troy. Those large Green Courts where we were wont to rove, With Eyes cast up unto the Maiden's Tower. With easie Sighs, such as Man draw in Love. The stately Seats, the Ladies bright of Hue, The dances short, long Tales of sweet Delight, The secret Groves which we have made resound. With Silver Drops the Meads yet spread for ruth As goodly Flowers on Thamesis do grow. The following Lines are by some attributed to Sir Francis Bryan. The Numbers seem to be more Harmonious than any we can find in others much more modern. Tagus farewell, which Westward with thy Streams. Turn'st up the Grains of Gold already try'd; For I with Spur and Sail go seek the Thames. Against the Sun that shews his wealthy Pride, And to the Town that Brutus sought by Dreams, Like bended Moon that leaves her lusty Side. To seek my Country now for whom I live. O Mighty Jove for this the Winds me give. On Royal Windsor, and our past Delights, Our Days of Sporting, and our Joyous Nights; Our Morning Pleasures, and our Evening Shade, And how we Lov'd, and what we did and said This to remember gives my Sorrows ease, And pleases still, when nothing else can please. Windsor, as Charming, as She's Noble, seems, The Boast of England, and the Pride of Thames; For Kings and Princesses a soft Retreat, To Love, delicious, and the Muses Seat. My Mistress with the Nymphs I there have seen, Confess'd in Beauty, and Desert, a Queen. There in the Forrest, or the Neighb'ring Groves, We stray'd together, and compar'd our Loves. Beneath a Poplar, or a Beechen, Shade, I sought, and have surpriz'd the Heav'nly Maid. And fondly have I guest your Virgin Care, And fancy'd, that you came to meet me there. This Image flatters, in my Fear, my Mind, Or else you were, or I believ'd you, kind. Oft on the Willows by the Banks of Thames, With Marks mysterious, I engrav'd our Names. When next you wander, by the River, see, These Wishes written on the fairest Tree, And as of you I think, Remember me. When Silvia sits beneath thy Shade, From Heat defend the Fair; A Thousand Odours round her spread, And Flora fan the Air. Te Birds, that singing in the Groves, Each others Breasts inspire; Instruct my Sylvia by your Loves, To bless a Swain's Desire. When Sylvia sleeps, Ye Gentle Streams! Who Lull her to her Rest; Inform the Virgin in her Dreams, How Damon wou'd be blest. England, to Italy, I still prefer, A Spring perpetual is, they tell me, here, But how can I believe, while thou art there? For Thee the Forrest blooms, the Meadow springs, And Philomel deceiv'd, in Autumn sings. Campania's Glory ne'er had reach'd our Isle, Had not her Muse been richer than her Soil. Nor boasted Tyber, nor the wanton Po, Like Thames, or Severn's Silver Currents, flow. Oh! were I sure at my Return to find, Your Heart the same, as when I left you, kind. Their painted Cities then wou'd tempt in vain, Their Courts, where Vanity, and Pleasure, reign. Their Pomp, their Luxury, I then wou'd scorn, To better Fortune in your Beauty born. O'er the rude Alps, with Eagle hast I'd fly, Cut the rough Waves, and fill my Arms with Joy. The Earl of Surrey was eldest Son to the Great Duke of Norfolk. He was, says the Learned Bishop of Salisbury in his History of the Reformation, a high spirited Man, had a vast Fortune, and the Head of the Popish Party; however a Man of great Qualities. He had a great Wit, and was more than ordinarily learned, his Heat in the Popish Cause ruin'd him, and he was try'd for Treason; the Pretence, his giving the Arms of Edward the Confessor, and being concern'd with his Father in other Plots and Crimes. This Earl wrote several very fine Poems for his Age, there are none so Gallant and of so fine a Turn, considering the Times, extant. There were also in King Henry VIIIth's Court, Sir Thomas Wyat, (Father of the unfortunate Sir Thomas Wyat in Queen Mary's Reign) who was a Gentleman very famous for his Genius in Poetry, and my Lord of Surrey's Friend Sir Francis Bryan, afterwards Embassador in France. Thus we see that their Love of the Muses was not then thought injurious to their Ministry, and he must himself have a very wretched Talent, who thinks the Man that excells in so delicate an Art cannot fit himself with a great deal of Ease for the most important Offices of the State. The same good Sense that made him shine as a Poet, will certainly make him illustrious as a Minister. There are several things in this Epistle, and the Lady's answer, which may give us an Idea of the Court and Manners of the Reign they liv'd in, and prove to us how Men of little Wit and little Honesty have attempted to be troublesome in their Generation, and what Opinion they had of their Industry. Lady Giraldine to Henry Howard Earl of Surrey. If, like my Surrey, I cou'd speak my Mind, John Earl of Kildare, her Ancestor, and Maurice his second Son, first Earl of Desmond, were descended from Thomas Fitz-Maurice, Lord Justice of Ireland, Son of Maurice Fitz Gerald, Son of Gerald, who married the Daughter of Rees, the Great Prince of Wales, and in a direct Line sprung from Walter Son of Oter of Windsor. My Love wou'd be as fond, my Heart as kind. 'Tis Custom, only, makes our Sex conceal The Flames that wast 'em, and which yours reveal. This niceness, Surrey! This my Pen restrains, Or else 'twould answer you in softer Strains. Less artful, yet as honest and sincere, Writ with more Truth, tho not with greater Care. Bred in a Court, their Manners I despise, Nor aim at Conquest by my Mien, or Eyes. No Hearts I flatter with pernicious Smiles, Nor make you Rivals by fallacious Wiles. My Heart, tho weak, is uncorrupt and pure, My Virgin Innocence the richest dowr. To You great Arbiter of Love and Wit, I fear to speak, and now, with trembling, write; Or I forget, or you have often said, Fear, tho 'tis folly, yet becomes a Maid. Our Virtue, with our Ignorance, we lose, And Innocence will want of Art excuse. If in your Absence I appear too free, If my Words shou'd'n with my Sex agree, Remember Lovers are not always wise, And Maids may be too forward or too nice. Uncertain if we e'er, again shall meet: Cou'd I love less, I might be more discreet. Yet, try my Errors, like a Judge severe, And chide me much, if I a little err. My Women, when your Letter I receiv'd. Or thought me Frantick, or a Fool believ'd. Transported as I was, they knew not why, Nor guest the Reason of my silent Joy. I strove to hide it, conscious of my Shame, But my Eyes sparkled, and confest my Flame. A Secret still I fain would have it be, And fearing to be seen, the more they see. They thought 'twas Love, but cou'd not think for whom, Nor whence the Message, and my Pleasure come. In Love, by Age, and long Experience learn'd, My Passion, by their Weakness they discern'd. I blush'd or smil'd at every Line I read, Forgetting where I was, or what I did; Your Verse, as powerful, as you think, they prove, 'Tis You, and You alone that won my Love. No Numbers can be sweeter than your Tongue, Your Voice more moving than your artful Song. So graceful are your Words, so soft your Air, They're forc'd to love you, who to listen dare. My Heart so tender, you may scarce, believe, And think, a Court has taught me to deceive. That You, like others, by my Smiles betray'd, Hear the false Vows which I to them have made. Who's proud of Worship, or is fond of Praise, Ne'er matters, if she conquers, what she says. She wants not Lovers, but to make 'em Slaves, And only to enlarge her Empire, craves. This in the Court, and in our Sex you see, So oft, you well may be afraid of Me. Shou'd you my meaning, or my Faith, mistrust, Your Judgment will be weak, as 'tis unjust. An Air of Truth in every Page appears, And what I ought not to reveal, declares. I wou'd not trust it, were it feign'd to you, You'll soon distinguish if 'tis false or true. Yet who from Slander in this Age is free, So thick it falls, perhaps 'twill light on me? To live at Court, where Spite and Envy reign, Whose Fame so pure, that Scandal will not stain: Tho such is mine, nor by my Foes deny'd, My only Frailty is, they tell me, Pride. In what, did any this my Error see, Of what am I, or vain, or proud, but Thee? I ne'er pretend that I from Florence came, Nor borrow Lustre from Giraldi's Name; Nor fancy Desmond or Kildare disgrace, The Boasted Glory of the Tuscan Race. The Line of Windsor and Fitzgerald bears, Sufficient Honours if they own me theirs. Were my Birth Nobler, or my ancient Blood, 'Tis only your Consent which makes it good. Where'er I come, I meet with something new, Which gives me Reason to remember you. At Windsor, when I walk for Evening Air, The Shades disgust me when I miss you there. Windsor where oft my Hero I beheld, Triumphant in the Lists, the Terror of the Field. To Nonsuch Forrest, when the Queen removes, The Trees I see are printed with our Loves. In Hampton's proud Magnificence I find, A lively Image of thy Princely Mind. I view at Richmond when the Court is there, The numerous Trophies of thy Northern War. And Woolsey's Gallery around is set, With rich Devices of thy Noble Wit. Greenwich is still to my Remembrance dear, 'Twas there we met, Alas! and parted there. The Town, the Country, are the same to me, My Thoughts are full, and every Place, of Thee. When the Winds rise, and angry Ocean boyls, I dread the Tempest, as I hate his Smiles, A Calm detains Thee, and a Storm destroys, This ruins both, and that prevents our Joys. I blame the lazy Winds, the Furious, fear, Or hope impatiently, or else despair. Oh! were you here beneath a Shade to tell, The Wonders which your Pen describes so well. So kind the Story from your Lips wou'd come, The Tuscan Greatness, and the Pride of Rome. The Wonders you have seen, we then shou'd hear, With greater Pleasure than you saw 'em there. Thus to their Dames, the Grecian Chiefs relate. The wast of Troy, and Mighty Hector's Fate. They draw the Figure of the War, in Wine, The Grecian there, and there the Trojan line. Were you now present with your artful Hands, To shew how Venice on her Pillars stands. To tell, or by your Picture to display, The beauteous City rising from the Sea. The Nuptials of her Prince, her Pomp marine, 'Tis the Custom of the Doge of Venice, once a Year, to go, attended by the Senate, in rich Gallies, and triumphant Manner to wed the Adriatick, to shew thereby that the Sovereignty of that Sea is in the Republick. By you were better told than ever seen. They're such as you, who in your Travels find, Illustrious Virtues to enrich your Mind. England you honour, and her Peers adorn, And Foreign Habits, and their Vices, scorn; While Fops infected with an itch to roam, Leave their few Morals, and their Wit, at home. Fond of the Vanities of different Climes, They bring their Follies back, and oft their Crimes At Rome they're lewd, at Paris they are vain, In Holland Drunkards, and devout in Spain. The Fools, who fear to be despis'd at home, The Folly of some People, who are fond of Rambling without qualifying themselves before, to make their Travels useful to them, gave Occasion to the following Lines; and much more might have been said on the Subject, if we did not fear to offend against Gallantry and Love, which will not admit of too much Satyr. Those who out of Vanity have wandred too far, are accountable for the Scandal our Country lies under among the refin'd Nations, who, shou'd they judge of such as are left at home, by the Merit of some that go abroad, may well take us for as barbarous as Cæsar found us. Wou'd raise their Merit by a Tour to Rome. They hope, by wandring from the common Road, To make a Figure, and to shine abroad. Strange Tales they tell, of what they've heard and seen, And how they were Carest, where'er they've been. What Ruins they beheld, what wast of Time, What Wines they met with in the Southern Clime. Who Sung, who Fiddled best, with this content, The Fops return as worthless as they went. Their Tast, in Fashions, and in Airs refin'd, They thought 'twas needless to improve the Mind. If such as these were only seen at Rome, They well may scorn the Region whence they come. But Surrey so Divinely Great appears, His Actions wipe away the Stain of theirs. To Me the Muses Sons, with Songs repair, And beg at least, that I wou'd deign to hear. I please 'em by approving what they bring, For next to Paying, is to hear 'em sing. They want Supplies, nor will a little serve, By Nature lavish, as they lov'd to starve, Prudence, it seems, is Av'rice with the Wits, And Care looks mean in any one but Citts. The little that they get, they madly spend, Still hoping, Fortune at the worst will mend. Their Fame, among their Fellows to secure, They think 'tis necessary to be Poor. This to the Bays, is oft their best Pretence, And want of Mony, less than want of Sense. Their Case, to you, they beg me to commend, There were some Persons in this Reign, who thought Poetry and Politicks were incompatible; and tho Sir Thomas Wyat, Sir Francis Bryan, Sir Thomas Moore, and the Lord Surrey, were all Lovers of the Muse at the same time that they distinguished themselves in the Cabinet or Field. Yet the Cry against the Poetical Ministers was so loud, that at last it prevail'd, and they were all outed. Their Prince, their Patron, and their constant Friend. Wits in your Absence, at the Court disgrac'd, The Muse neglected, and her Sons displac'd. To You, by Me, to be reliev'd they fly, The Mean wou'd be excus'd, the Great deny. E'en those, that only by her Favour rose, Another Complaint against those Gentlemen, was, that while they had it in their Power to do good, and several fair Proposals were made to 'em for the Advancement of Learning, and the Encouragement of those that deserv'd it in all Sciences, yet they slipt the Opportunity, and forgot the Art which had been so serviceable to them, taking too much Care to get Money, and to keep what they had gotten. 'Tis true, they were well with the Court, and their Loyalty hid a great many Faults. But they had in general disoblig'd those whom they once cherish'd, and for the sake of one or two writers, who made their Court to 'em with most Assiduity, neglected the rest, and were severely censur'd by their Brethren. They found when they had occasion for their Pens, how impolitick it was to be Partial to a few, who cou'd not defend them, neglect those who cou'd. However as they were guilty of no such false Steps in the publick Affairs, the Bards shou'd have forgiven their Errors in private ones. Her Friends, when humble, when advanc'd, her Foes. Their Brethren, in Necessity despise, And keep 'em down, if they attempt to rise. Tho these Ministers were not only Lovers of Poetry, but perform'd in it with Reputation. Yet so far were they from encouraging the Art, that when Address was made to 'em by the Poets for Favour, they as often hindred their Advancement, as help'd 'em to rise. With Partial Bounty, they their Gifts dispense, And Sots are better paid, than Men of Sense. Who sings his Ballad, who his Musick plays, Or he that reads his Poem has a Place. Who most adores 'em, for a Wit they choose, And his must be the best, the taking Muse. The rest are despicable and obscure, To make him rich, they keep his Fellows poor, No Wit but his, no Critick they'll allow, And all the Poets Sheaves to his must bow. The Monster Faction, with devouring Rage, First fell upon the Court, and next the Stage. She snarl'd at both, her venom'd Teeth she shew'd, And all the Mischief did 'em that she cou'd. For you, they both with equal Reason cry, These Clouds before your shining worth wou'd fly. Your mighty Genius, wou'd their Peace restore, And Fools and Knaves be suffer'd there no more. The Building Founded, in your Absence lies, The Lord Surrey built a very noble Structure on Leonard's Hill, over against the City of Norwich, which the Rabble in Ket's Insurrection, in Edward the VI's Reign, almost demolish'd. It had a fine Prospect of the River Yare, and the lovely Vale of Mouschole under it. The House was from this Lord, call'd Mount Surrey. With the Ground level, and despairs to rise. Your self the Architect, the Treasure yours, And Norwich waits to see the promis'd Tow'rs. 'Tis mine, my Surrey, 'tis the People's Voice, Restore our Darling, and secure our Joys. The Muses then will to their Seats return, The Nymphs to sigh, the Shepherds cease to mourn. Discord and Faction of their Aims will fail, And Merit be prefer'd, and Wit prevail. But what is dearer, what is more to me, My Heart will meet with all its Hopes in Thee. EPISTLE IV. The Lady Jane Gray, being left by King Edward the VI's will his Successor, She was on his Death Proclaim'd Queen, but her Reign lasted only Ten Days. She was in that short time put out of her Pretensions, by the Power of King Edward's Sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. Queen Mary confin'd both the Lady Jane, and the Lord Guilford Dudley, her Husband, to separate Apartments in the Tower. Where these Two Epistles are suppos'd to be written from one to the other, a Day or Two before they were beheaded. The Lady Jane Gray was Daughter to the Duke of Suffolk, and the Lord Guilford Dudley, Son to the Duke of Northumberland. The Lady Jane Gray, to the Lord Guilford Dudley. Since from my Lord, I am by Bolts confin'd, This only way is lest to ease my Mind. This, in the Loss of mighty Blessings past, Is our sole Refuge, and, Alass! the last, Of such as keep me, I demand of Thee, As Thou, I hear by them, dost ask for me. To these, I make it oft my earnest Pray'r, Go to my Lord, my dearest Witnes bear. Tell him— but then, I speak the rest in Sighs, And they, the Message, and my Griefs despise. They shut the massy Doors with savage Care, And what I fain wou'd speak, refuse to hear. Deaf to my Cryes, they leave me to my Woe Nor stay to learn, what thou wou'dst gladly know. No friendly Voice to sooth me in my Pains, No Sound, but jarring Doors, and ratling Chains. At once for Thee, and for my self, I fear, I view the dismal Hour approaching near. In Thee, our Foes will soonest reach my Heart, 'Tis terrible to die, but worse to part. I now the utmost of their Malice feel, Nor dread the sharpen'd Axe, nor pointed Steel. My Innocence wou'd teach me to endure, My doom with Patience, were my Love secure. For Thee my Anxious Soul, is still in Pain, For Thee, the Partner of my Bonds and Reign. This forces from my Eyes a briny Flood, To weep for Thee, who soon must weep in Blood. Now let thy Virtue in thy Looks appear, Our Foes are pleas'd the more, the more we fear. Whate'er to suffer, we're by them compell'd, Yet let us never to our Sufferings yield. The Guilt was only theirs, to whom we owe, The Dukes of Suffolk and Northumberland's Ambition, the Occasion of their Children's Ruin. Our Life, our Nuptials, and our present Woe. Instructed by our Parents to rebel, We rose with them, and in their Fall, we fell. Not our Ambition rais'd us to a Crown, Their Pride advanc'd us, as it pull'd us down. Not born to Empire, they usurp'd the Pow'r, And when they aim'd to mount, they brought us low'r. Thus Fortune our aspiring Hopes deceives, And those she flatter'd, in their Ruin leaves. To act the things, they had design'd, afraid, Their Councils tempted, and their Hearts betray'd. Anothers Right, we never, had desir'd, Nor by wrong Steps to Mary's Throne aspir'd; If those who better shou'd have taught our Youth, Had led us safely in the Paths of Truth. Our Error's fatal, and our Foe severe, But great our Courage, and our Conscience clear. Her Share of Fate, thy Wife alike sustains, Our Pleasures once the same, and now the same our Pains. The Smiles and Frowns of Fortune we have known, And been as happy, as we're now undone. Another's Int'rest made me first thy Bride My Heart rejoyc'd, and blest our Father's Pride With Hymeneal Song our Pallace rung, The Priests, the Nobles, and the People sung. The House of Suffolk was to Dudley's joyn'd, And glorious Projects by the Match design'd. Love was our end, and we our end enjoy'd, They with their Projects are themselves destroy'd. Soon broke the Knot, they hop'd wou'd never break, Their Thoughts prodigious, but their Forces weak. They put a Royal Scepter in my Hand, An useless Present this, without Command, The Crown, the Globe, nor all the Forms of Sway, Nor gave us Right, nor made the Realms obey. No vain Dominion, like Content, is sweet, And he who rules himself, is truly great. Happy had I, and Guilford, ever been, Descended from Frances, the Daughter of Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, by Mary Queen Dowager of France, and K. Henry VIII's Sister. Had they ne'er forc'd me to be call'd a Queen Happy our Fathers, had they deign'd to hear, Our just Excuses, and allow'd our Fear. Happy our Houses, had their Lords in Peace, Consulted to preserve, and not increase. Contented with the Honours of our Name, Ne'er push'd their Fortune on a lawless Claim. Had they perceiv'd the Precipice was nigh, Nor ventur'd with their waxen Wings too high. I boast no Merit from the Royal Line, Tho' noble Brandon mixt his Blood with mine. The beauteous Princess he in Triumph lead, And crown'd, with better Joys, her widow'd Bed. In her the long contending Roses joyn'd, And on one Stalk their friendly Branches twin'd. In her the pure Vermilion, and the white, Their Names united and disputed right. From her my Blood, in generous Channels, flows, End thence our Honour, and our Folly rose. Forgive me—'tis untimely to be vain, In Death, we little from our Birth shall gain. To learn to die will now avail us most, King Henry always fear'd his Daughter Mary wou'd restore the papal Power and Worship. For all Distinction in the Grave is lost. Who, when an Empire is in view wou'd spare, His nearest Blood, and think the Purchase dear. Who dares to plead Relation to a Throne, The Divorce between Queen Katherine, the Lady Mary's Mother, and King Henry. A Kindom never shou'd be claim'd, till won. Kings, like the Sun, their distant Objects chear, But burn, whoever dares approach too near. No tyes of Friendship can oblige a Crown, The Prince, will all the Man profest, disown. What most, great Henry study'd to avoid, Is now befaln, and what he built destroy'd. Edward, too early for the Faith is gone, And Mary next, by right, demands the Throne. What Heaven has joyn'd can earthly Courts divorce, Or Man his Will oppose by Wit or Force. The Creature may resolve, the God fulfills, Who oft opposes what the Mortal Wills. When Heav'n appears to plead the righteous Cause. How impotent is Power, or humane Laws. The Proud he disappoints, upholds the Meek, Disarms the Mighty, and supports the weak. Men fondly raise Foundations on the Sands, While Virtue, on a Rock, securely stands. In Death, my Lord, let this be thy Support, The Path is gloomy, but the Passage short. A shining Host will meet us on the way, And guide us to the source of endless Day. Look up, my Guilford, to our Heavenly Crown, That still is ours, tho this on Earth is gone. We thither, when our Hour is come, shall soar, Meet in the starry Way, and part no more: Behold the Regions of Emperial Light, We there shall Reign, and none dispute our Right. But how can Nature with these Hopes comply; Or fond of living, we consent to dye. How pass the Vale of Death, a horrid Gloom, And leave this Crown with Joy, for one to come. Yet if, by Faith, these Terrors we remove, There still remains, a greater Terror, Love. Love oft presents Thee, murder'd to my Eyes, I hear thy dying Groans, and latest Sighs. 'Tis Torture to my Soul, to this I yield, And Faith, till then Victorious, quits the Field. I feel thy Wounds, thy deadly Sorrows bear, And careless of my self, for Thee I fear. To whom, in our Distress, shall we repair, Implore the listning God, by earnest Pray'r? Him let us move, to smooth the rugged Way, And light us with a Beam of future Day. In all our wants, if we on him rely, In Life, or Death, he will our wants supply. By Grace he'll lead us to the darksome Grave, And then, reward us, for the Grace he gave. On Him, for Succour, in our Hour depend, Against the Tempter, he'll our Hearts defend. But jealous of his Glory, will be woo'd, Just to himself, as he to us is good. View thy past Life, and all thy Actions scan, See then what Merit thou canst find in Man. To Him with me, thy humble Vows address, Repentant praise him, and thy Faults confess. The God benificent, our Vows will hear, And will Illustrious in our Cause appear. Nor Earth, nor Hell, shall then our Souls dismay, Nor we be to our Foes, or Death, a Prey. Superior to their Malice, we shall rise, And Death conduct us to immortal Bliss. Unutterable Joys reserv'd on high, For such as live by Faith, and in its Author die. Then, grateful Thanks to our Creator pay, Who calls us hence, before the dreadful Day. When Sin and Idols shall these Realms defile, And Flames of cruel Zeal destroy this Isle, Through Racks and Fires the Sons of God must go, Through Agonies of Blood, and bitter Woe. Happy that we the Martyrs Crown shall gain, Nor live to see the Foe, his House profane. May Mary's Womb be found a barren Soil, Nor leave to foreign Heirs, this Realm, a Spoil. May her wrong'd Sister, in her Throne succeed, And cleanse the Church of ev'ry noxious Weed. May fair Eliza, all her Fears survive, And Peace to Sion, in Affliction give. Sion, tho desolate and wast before, Again shall flourish, and despair no more. Again Eliza, shall the Faith maintain, Shake of the Yoke of Rome, and humble Spain. A fragrant Name, the martyr'd Saints shall leave, Those joy with Sion, who with Sion grieve. Farewel my dearest Lord, our end is near, Heav'n is our home, we are but Strangers here. There, from our worldly Labours we shall rest, With Visions of Eternal Splendor blest. Farewel—and do not of thy Lot complain, We part a while, but soon shall meet again. Lord Guilford Dudley to Lady Jane Gray. Attend, my Love, and hear thy Lord complain, I sing my Elegy, a mournful Strain; Like Swans, who by a Stream their Fate bewail, And, the Song ended, in the current Fall. Attend, my Love, and in the Consort joyn, Try thy last Notes, and tune thy Voice by mine. Together let us sigh, together weep, And equal Measure in our Sorrow, keep. By Grief consummate, we our Foes will move, At least to pity, whom they cannot love. Such Words from me, methinks; thou shoudst not hear, Nor I discourage, whom I ought to chear. Tho in thy writing, I such Virtue see, As shews no Sign of want of Help from me. Believe not in my Tryal, I shall faint, Thou my Example, and protecting Saint. I court not Life, nor will I fear to die, But tremble, when I think thy Fate is nigh. More than my Love can for her self, I fear, Nor was she ever to her self so dear. A Thousand Lives with her, wou'd soon be gone, What Portion then have I to spare of one? Teach me ye Powers! to be resign'd like her, That I may Martyrdom, to Life prefer. Teach me with Joy, to meet the dreadful Blow, Nor suffer me to sink beneath my Woe. When for approaching Death, I shou'd prepare, I try my Heart, and find Thee always there. Thou my best Blessing, art my greatest Ill, The Cause, tho Guiltless of the Pains, I feel. So much I meditate in my Distress, Of Love and Thee, I think of Heav'n the less. No Star with baleful Aspect did portend, Thy Birth unhappy, or thy Life, this end. To my own Danger, and thy Safety, blind, I, fond of Empire, with our Fathers join'd. Approv'd their Councils, and to Act resolv'd, And in our Ruin thou wer't thus involv'd. As Indian Widows in their Brides attire, Wait on their Husbands to the funeral Fire, Ascend the Pile, and in the Flames expire. I boast not now of Dudley's Name or Blood, The Duke of Northumberland (then Earl of Warwick) overthrew Ket the Rebel at Mount Surry in Norfolk. Of Peace by him restor'd, or Ket subdu'd. The Laurels which my Victor Father won, Are now of little value to his Son. His Glories are in this attempt forgot, So much his latter Deeds, his former blot. I boast not of the Heroes of my Race, With ev'ry Virtue blest, and ev'ry Grace. Nor of our Infants, in our Loss undone, descended from Mary the French Queen, Daughter to Henry VII. Tho sprung of Kings, and Kindred to the Throne. Thou only art my Pride, of Thee I boast, And in thy bright Perfections, Glory most. I ne'er by Courting Thee, to Reign aspir'd, I lov'd, and nothing but thy Love desir'd. Till more acquainted with thy Merit grown, I found that none so well deserv'd the Crown. A perfect Queen by Nature thou wer't made, Thy Eyes command us, and thy Lips perswade. And when, if e'er, thy matchless Beauty fails, Thy Wisdom with resistless Force prevails. Thy self more worthy, more esteem'd by me, Than all that else, I might expect by Thee. So chast thy Love, so innocent thy Life, The Virgin was not purer than the Wife. And Heav'n in Thee so great a Gift bestow'd, Itself cou'd only be a greater Good, Such was the Joy, the Treasure I possest, Rich in thy Charms, and in thy Virtue blest. Our selves in Peace, our Fame we then enjoy'd, Whom, false Ambition, and the War destroy'd. Who to Ambition hearkens, is undone, All Arms are ready to defend the Throne. Happy the Man, whose Fortune and Desire, Nor tempts him to encrease it, or aspire. When Dudley led the Royal Armies forth, Made General by the Council to go against Queen Mary. Who doubted then his Forces, or his Worth. Our sagest Councils then advis'd the War, They councell'd boldly, till the Foe was near. The Churches Danger justify'd the Cause, Own'd by the Judges, and confirm'd by Laws. Our Foes prepar'd their Arms, our Friends their Prayers, Our Cause was righteous, but successful theirs. What Prince's Act, when He's no more, will bind? K. Edw. VI. by his Will, left the Crown to this Lady Jane. Who has most Right, will most Assistance find. This Mary knew, and this her Friends inspir'd, Who flockt to hers, and from our Camp retir'd. The Suffolk People, Suffolk's Hopes oppose, And who were most our Friends, are most our Foes. We wish'd to know, before to Reign we knew, Fond of a Crown, while only 'twas in view. But when possest, and giddy with the height, We saw our Ruin, but 'twas then too late. For us, who feels soft Pity in his Breast, There, if he loves his Safety, let it rest. So wretched we're become of what we were, 'Tis Death to think our Usage is severe, For us, the Foe, no Pardon has in Store, And but to ask it, they wou'd rage the more. The Rancour of their Souls, enough they shew, Enough the Goodness of their Hearts we know. Whate'er wou'd please us, they in spite deny, Nor suffer whom we love, to see us dye, Our Children, and our Friends, Content must bear Our Loss, nor venture once to shed a Tear. Not the least Sigh, nor one reluctant Word, Must our old Servants on our Death afford. And those, who lately were ador'd by all, Unpitty'd now, and unlamented fall. Here for Protection and Defence we came, Our Place of Honour once, as now of Shame. What we have been, and what we are, we see, These Chains but ill, with what we were, agree. Let us look back on worldly Pomp no more, Our Day on Earth is done, our Business o'er. For Death, 'tis now our Duty to prepare, Heav'n is our home, and we shall soon be there. Farewel—My Soul is on the Wing to fly, Disdains the nether World, and mounts on high. EPISTLE V. The Earl of Essex having offended Queen Elizabeth, by coming from his Expedition in Ireland without her Permission, and the Earl in taking the Advice of my Lord Southampton, with other hot Men, his Friends, endeavouring to engage the People in his Defence—His Enemies the Lord Burleigh, and Sir Walter Raleigh, manag'd their Hate so well with the Queen, that they got him to be apprehended, try'd, and afterwards beheaded, while the Queen was in her Fury: Who, as 'tis said, heartily repented of it, and his death occasion'd hers, or at least shorten'd her Days. This Letter is suppos'd to be sent him the Day before his Tryal, and his Answer return'd a Day or Two after. Queen Elizabeth to the Earl of Essex. See Essex! see how weakly I maintain, The former Glories of my Virgin Reign. Betray'd, forsook, to write Thee, I descend, And use Thee still, as thou wer't still my Friend, To Thee, this Favour, like the rest will prove, Despis'd perhaps, because it looks like Love. Mistaken Pity, will thy Pride deceive, Which rather shou'd confound Thee, than relieve. But vain and haughty in thy latest Hour, My Mercy thou'lt abuse, as once my Power. Yet say, Ungrateful! what thy Arts can plead, To save thy Honour, and thy forfeit Head. The Lords, thy Judges, for thy Doom prepare, Thy Crimes as heavy, as the Court severe. Condemn'd already, by the general Voice, Thy Friends forsake Thee, and thy Foes rejoice. Cecill's base Envy, whom he fear'd reviles, Cecill, Lord Burleigh; whose Envy of this Noble Earl and his Politicks too great for the generous open Temper of my Lord Essex, work'd him on to his Destruction. And Raleigh, with malicious Pleasure smiles. Sir Walter Raleigh; 'tis the blemish of his Life, that he concern'd himself in the Fate of our unfortunate Hero. The Mighty and Warlike Prince James I. return'd the hard Measure on him he dealt to this Earl in the House of Commons, of which he was then a Member. Their Malice, with their Duty, they conceal, 'Tis the Queens Safety, and the publick Weal, The worst of Treasons, to thy Charge is laid, An Army famish'd, and a Trust betray'd. They urge, a Nation by thy wast undone, The Rebels pardon'd, and their chief Tyrone. Thy Fears they tell me, did the Traytor save, And scare will now allow thee to be brave, Their brutal rage shou'd on themselves be spent, Were Essex, what I wish him, Innocent. So much confest, by one so much abus'd, Thou'lt fancy nothing, will be next refus'd. But know, Unhappy! if I wish Thee free, 'Tis more to vindicate my self, than Thee. Thee, whom to rival Monarchs, I prefer'd, To be the Queens, to be the Nations Guard! Essex enter'd into a Treaty with the Rebel Tyrone, which his Commission, large as the Queens Favour, qualified him to do. This was a main Article against him at his Tryal. The Creature of my Favour, Thee I chose, To fight my Battles, and chastise my Foes. Warm'd by my Smiles, and kindled into Man, Thy Soul to feel Heroick Flames began: Till then to Fortune, and to Fame, unknown, Who since defended, and adorn'd the Throne. Mine are thy Laurels, and Iberian-Spoils, Thy Northern Conquest, and thy boasted Toils. The vast Design, the Martial Spirit, mine, The dull Mechanick Action only thine. Thus form'd, the Hero I created, dares, Insult his Queen, and raise Rebellious Wars. My Court disturb'd with Faction and Allarms, My Person threaten'd, and the Croud in Arms. Oh Faithless! is it thus I am repay'd, And thus thou justify'st the Choice I made. What will the Nations; what will England say Who dread my Anger, or my Laws obey. If this unpunish'd, unreveng'd they see, 'Twere just they took my Crown, and gave it Thee. So fierce thy Courage, and thy Soul so great, 'Tis said, the Earl's Carriage to the Queen at their last Enterview, was such, as provok'd her to strike him. The Blow receiv'd, thov never canst forget. Struck by a Queen, the Mighty Warriour raves, Whose Rage had else been punish'd by her Slaves. Affronted thus, thou think'st thy Honour lost, A Fate too Glorious, and which Kings wou'd boast. Think of thy Insolence, and thank thy Stars, Thy Rudeness more advanc'd Thee, than thy Wars. My boundless Fury, has enlarg'd thy Fame, And more my Patience, than my Passion, blame. Provok'd, to strike Thee, I abus'd the Throne, To me, Dishonour, as to Thee, Renown. Yet this, thy Folly, and thy Pride, proclaim, With fruitless Threats, injurious to thy Name. Rail on—thy Rage is impotent and base, And shews thou ill deserv'dst a better Place. My Lord of Essex was then in the Tower. But that the Wretch who wrong'd me, I despise, And scorn to triumph o'er the Man who dyes: How might I now upbraid Thee, and expose, A Picture, blacker, than thy vilest Foes? What hinders that, thus injur'd, I forbear, To leave Thee, to their Malice and Despair: What in thy Actions hast thou left undone, My Quiet to disturb, and shake my Throne. I cannot, must not think of this again, Nor, while I prosecute Revenge, complain. By those, who follow'd and ador'd Thee, left, Of Favour, Pity, and of Help bereft. How easie might my Vengeance be pursu'd, If thine wou'd please me, as thou seek'st my Blood. None wou'd thy Merit, or thy Cause defend, If Rutland were not faithful to her Friend. The Countess of Rutland, fam'd for her Beauty and her Love for this Lord. She sighs and mourns, and in her earnest Pray'rs, Too much of Love, too much Concern appears. Nor is her Friendship, or her Passion young, 'Tis fed with Hopes, and has been flatter'd long. In this, if I discover thy Deceit, Her Grief is not as certain as thy Fate. If by thy Wiles, unlicens'd, thou hast strove, To tempt her from her Duty, and to love. New Guilt, and heavier, will increase thy Store, And sink Thee deeper than thou wert before. The Queen, by high Prerogative, decreed, The Beauteous Orphan, to another Bed. 'Tis Treason, to divert her Virgin Vows, Corrupt my Servants, and divide my House. My Word engag'd, or what have I to care, For what she thinks of thee, or thou of her. A Heart so false, and such a faithless Tongue, Will never be belov'd, or never long. Oh hadst thou prov'd, as Loyal and Sincere, As Eminent in Truth, as great in War. Wert thou, as once I thought thou wou'dst have been, True to thy Oaths, thy Duty and the Queen; Did thy proud Heart pernicious Arts despise, Nor sought without me, and too fast, to rise. Cecill of Plots, and Treasons might complain, And Raleigh curse his Rival, but in vain. Their Spite discover'd, thou mightst laugh to see, The Shame return'd on Them, they meant on Thee. Safe in thy Innocence, thou needst not fear, How Envy cou'd defame, or hurt Thee here. Left by thy Friends, on me thou mighst depend, While the Queen liv'd, thou shoud'st not was a Friend. Willing to help, cou'd I my Help excuse, To save the Life, which thou art fond to lose The Earl of Leicester, my Lord Essex's Predecessor in the Queens good Graces. An injur'd Monarch wou'dst thou else defie, Philip II. King of Spain, Henry III. the French King and the King of Sweden, courted Queen Elizabeth. But Penitent in Guilt, to Mercy fly, Woudst thou so nigh Conviction, else arraign, My Sov'reign Justice, and thy Wrongs maintain, How art thou wrong'd, if 'tis not by the weight, Of Honours, Wealth, and being made too great. Advanc'd so high in Favour and in Pow'r, That nothing but a Crown cou'd raise thee more. Ev'n Kings, grew jealous of thy growing Pride, And Leicester grieving at thy Fortune, dy'd. Philip, and Henry, and the gallant Sweed, With different Hopes, pretended to my Bed. I scorn'd their Empires, and repeated Vows, My People, I resolv'd, shou'd be my Spouse. Nor wanted Heroes of consummate Worth, To guide the State, and lead my Armies forth Some in the Field, in Councel some excel, The first in both was Essex, till he fell. Young, and a Victor, yet in Fortune wise, He early won our Hearts, he charm'd our Eyes, Nor rose as fast as he deserv'd to rise. Thus Loyal was he once, belov'd and brave, Shall he now Perish, whom a Word wou'd save. Tell me 'tis Cecill, who his Death contrives, Or Raleigh, undistinguish'd, while he lives. My Mercy thou may'st easily deceive; Repent, and what thou pleasest, I'll believe. Yet least thy Folly, and my Wrath return, Or we too late, our cruel Councils mourn. This, tho thy Judges shou'd thy Fate decree, Ensures thy Safety, and will set thee free. This Present use in thy extreamest want, Whate'er with This is ask'd, I'll freely grant. The Queen sent him a Ring, as part of the Story says, by the best Judges thought to be fabulous, but never the worse for a Poetical Fiction. She told him whenever he return'd the Ring, whatever he then demanded, she wou'd grant. The Lady Nottingham to be reveng'd on the Earl, for past ill usage, took the Ring of him, but never gave it the Queen, nor told her of it, till after the Earl's Death. The Earl of Essex to Queen Elizabeth. Fairest, and Greatest, of your Sex, believe, Less for my Sentence, than your Hate, I grieve. Oh! cou'd you pity me, if not forgive, I then shou'd rather choose to die, than live. To Sin, and die unpardon'd is my Curse, But Life, and not to be forgiv'n, worse. Nor Ax, nor Scaffold, wou'd my Fear create, Nor Death, or what is terrible in Fate; Wou'd my Queen pity my unworthy Doom, And honour with a Tear, my happy Tomb; My greedy Foes, unenvy'd, shou'd enjoy The Pow'r, for which, your Essex they destroy. I dare not on my Innocence relye, My Queen offended, I deserve to die. Else my past Service, and triumphant Wars, My Wounds for England, and my frightful Scars. Else Cales, by me, your Conquest I might plead, The Earl of Essex, when my Lord Howard, Admiral at the Expedition of Cales, commanded him with a Squadron, of Men of War to begin the Attack, threw his Hat into the Sea for Joy, and did Wonders in that Action. Dispute with this for Mercy, and succeed. Young as I was, I won the doubtful Fight, And forc'd the Spaniards to inglorious Flight. The Darling of the People, I return'd, By all then worship'd, as I now am scorn'd. Enrich'd, the Soldiers, and their General came, My Troops with Plunder, and my self with Fame. Oh Essex! lost for ever, where are now, The Crouds, which at thy Presence us'd to bow? Where are the supple Slaves, who then ador'd, The youthful Follies of the rising Lord? Contemn'd, forgot, they leave me in my Shame, And whom they flatter'd much, they much defame. What are their Falshood, their Reproach or Scorn, Light as their Praise, and easie to be born? The Queen appeas'd again, they wou'd adore, The Man they curse, and bless him as before. My Queen's just Fury, I confess I fear, Such Majesty enrag'd, I cannot bear, But sink beneath my Sorrows, and despair. Learn'd by Experience, and by Suffering, wise, As others mine, their Fortune I despise, Who hope, when Essex is remov'd, to rise. For Envy, or their own Ambition, soon, Will spoil the work, they think so well begun Who shares his Prince's Bounty, wou'd have all, And higher as he mounts, prepares his Fall. My Error, this, in others I can see, And that will ruin them, which ruin'd me. Oh Essex! Happy once, belov'd, carest, With the Queen's Favour, and the People's, blest. Faln from thy Height, so miserably low, Thy Foes then envy'd, whom they pitty now. Ev'n Cecill, of Remorse and Pity void, Weeps o'er the Wretch his jealousie destroy'd. He weeps to view the cruel Turns of Fate, And fearing for himself, repents his Hate. My Queen, or thus, I flatter my Despair, Believes my Judges, in my Cause, severe. My Crimes were such, as Raleigh wish'd to see, Sir Walter Raleigh succeeded the Earl of Essex in the Command of the Queens Guards. Not what they were, but what he'd have 'em be. Death was his aim, and nothing less wou'd do, My Life he wanted, and my Honours too. Cou'd Essex be so faithless, and so base, He oft might have prevented this Disgrace. The Power you gave him, had he ill employ'd, Or joyn'd those Rebels, whom his Arms destroy'd. My want of Faith, might then have fatal prov'd, Which tempted much, you ever found unmov'd. 'Tis said, an Army, by my Conduct starv'd, Convince the World, that I these Chains deserv'd. My Treaty with Tyrone, my Trust betray'd, My Troops by Famine, and Disease decay'd; The sickly Soldiers, well might dread the Foe, And fear to Combat, when they scarce cou'd go. The Peace I gave, Necessity compell'd, Content to conquer thus, who else must yield. My Care had better in my Charge been try'd, Had Cecill as he ought, the Camp supply'd. 'Twas reported by my Lord Essex's Friends, that Provisions were kept back by Cecill's means, then Minister of State, to bring his Army into streits, and ruin my Lord's Reputation. To me, your Armies Losses, might be laid, Cou'd I cure Sickness, or cou'd make 'em Bread. Hard Fate of Heroes, who from Battle come, To fall by Cowards, and their Arts at home. These may their Princes, and their People guard, If others Service, you like mine reward. For who for Victory, or Fame will strive, To die like Traytors, or like Slaves to live? This the fair Crop, the Victor's Harvest brings, The common Gratitude of jealous Kings. They fear the Valour, which secures the Throne And hate the Glories that eclipse their own, So Fatal! to oblige or serve a Crown. Who'll Court Commands, or venture with 'em far, While trembling Ministers direct the War. Their Councils still distracted by their Fear, And Danger ever in their Fancy near. Commissions, narrow as their Souls they grant, And fatten, while the Soldier pines with want. The General, when he fails, their Censure bears, Whenever he succeeds, the Praise is theirs. Their Wisdom then, the mighty Action rules, And Soldiers are at best, but Statesmens Tools, A dull, unthinking Herd of fighting Fools. Fools; since to every wealthy plotting Knave, 'Tis folly to be Honest, or be Brave. Burleigh be curst, for 'tis to him I owe, These Horrors, and this Bitterness of Woe. Curst be his Treasons, and his Plots, from them This Prison, Sentence, and Dishonour came: Than whom, there never in a State was known, A Villain fitter, to betray a Crown. His Temper, Cruelty; and Gold, his Lust; To Vengeance only, and his Int'rest just. For Him too soon, too late, Alass! for Me, Whose Trust was executed best, you'll see. 'Tis time for Essex, dying, to forget, The Joys and Sorrows of a Mortal State. Short is the Scene which he's to act below, And Heav'n commands him to forgive his Foe. Forgive me Heav'n, if Humane Passion's frail, And Nature suffering will to Death prevail. Pardon, my beauteous Sov'reign, if my Rage, Breaks out too fierce, before I quit the Stage. The last rude Action of my Life forgive, 'Twas Madness, rather than Design, believe. Sincere my Penitence, to Heav'n and You, Whatever I was then, I now am true. No Merit, by my Services, I claim, Yet pray my Mistress to defend my Name. Let not base Tongues, your Essex dead, revile, The Earl jealous of Nottingham's Fidelity in returning the Ring. Nor wrong the Man, on whom You deign'd to smile. But Oh! what Words can move you to be kind, To the dear Relict I must leave behind. At last, it seems, the fatal Secret's known. Tho sure our Loves were harmless to the Throne. My own Misfortunes, I cou'd proudly bear, Yet, my Soul shrinks, when I consider her. For Her, and for our Infant, yet unborn, And what for me they may endure, I mourn. With this, tho you may never this receive, I send the Present you were pleas'd to give. 'Tis my Lifes surety, and returns by Her, Whom the Queen trusted, and yet whom I fear. On my Knees bending, I your Gift restore, And Favour only for my Wife implore. Her Youth, her Beauty, and Distresses join, To move your Pity, in itsself Divine. Protect her Innocence from Cecill's Rage, And her poor Infant in its helpless Age. So may just Heav'n defend your sacred Head, So may your Councils, so your Arms succeed. A better Servant you perhaps may find, Yet ne'er repent you were to Essex kind. The Two Letters in Cabala of this Noble Earl's, are the best writ of any of the Kind in his Days. EPISTLE VI. Mary Queen of the Scots, had, during her Marriage with Francis the Dauphin, Son to the French King Henry II. pretended She was Heiress to the Crown of England, as descending from Margaret Daughter to Henry VII. King of England, by James IV. King of Scotland and that Queen Elizabeth was illegitimate. This and her Attempts to raise a Rebellion, and being accus'd of Babington's Conspiracy against the Life of the Queen, were the Cause of her Death at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire, where She was beheaded after a long Imprisonment. The Duke of Norfolk suffer'd for Misprision of her Treasons, supplying her with Money to send to the Scots, who invaded our Borders, and endeavouring to marry her against the Queens Consent. What their Fates were, will be better seen in the Duke's Epistle, and Queen Mary's Answer. Duke of Norfolk, to Mary Queen of the Scots. At last our Foes, illustrious Queen, succeed, And Norfolk sentenc'd, must to morrow bleed. All vile Submission, I for life despise, My Soul preparing for her Native Skies. Great, like my Actions, shall my Death appear, Who dauntless, oft have met him in the War. Let bloody States-men, from his presence fly, Who live by Treason, must with Horror die. Let Burleigh tremble, when his Name he hears, To me familiar, and below my Fears. T'wou'd please the Traytor, and the Cruel Queen, Were the least Terror, in my Sufferings seen. But Innocent and wrong'd, my Heart disdains, By Fear, to shew that I deserve my Chains. To Court the curst Contriver of my shame, And stain the Honours of our Princely Name, No—Let him Howard, like the rest devour, I dare his Malice, and defie his Power. What can I hope, from an Ungrateful Queen? To Cringe like Cecill, I must be as mean. Cast in a Mould, as Crooked as his mind, The Lord Burleigh was not the honestest, nor the best shap'd Man of his time. In Spite to Nature, he destroys his kind; Such Servants, ever may such Sovereigns find. Vain of her Wisdom, every fawning Slave, Who flatters her in this, insults the Brave. Cowards and Hypocrites her Pow'r maintain, The famous Pillars of her Virgin Reign: Whose virtue is their Wealth, whose God their gain. To these, shall Norfolk for a Pardon bow, Sunk in his Spirit, as in Fortune low? Shall I to Leicester, in distress apply, Confess my Guilt, and own I dread to die. Shall I his Vallour, or his Wit Commend, Or praise him for his zeal to serve his Friend. Must I to Cecill, tell my mournful Tale, My Gold, will sooner, than my Grief prevail. To Moreton—Curse him—must I make my Plaint, The Earl of Moreton, a great Enemy of the Scots Queen. Pray him to mediate as my Guardian Saint. Approve the Murder of his Lord, and swear, The States are Loyal, and his Zeal sincere. The States of Scotland, set up James VI. of Scotland, her Son, under the Government of Murray. 'Tis thought by some, that Moreton was concern'd in the Death of the Lord Darnly, the Queen of the Scots first Scottish Husband, but by others, with more reason, that Earl Bothwell, who got after into the Queens Bed, turn'd out the other. The Senate with Petitions, shall I vex, And stile their Mistress, fairest of her Sex. Tell her She's Beauteous, Merciful and Young, And own her Title, in Maria's Wrong. If my false Tongue, my Love and Faith denies, Witness,—Whoever hears me, that it lies, If, from my Fathers, I so far decline, May Moreton's Death, and Cecill's Fate be mine. In either World, Perdition be my Lot, Tormented in the next, in this forgot. What better from a Court, cou'd I expect, That acts, as Burleigh pleases to direct? How can a Subject, of his Rage complain, Whose Hands, Divinity it self profane. Gods! is it thus, the Nations shou'd adore, The rightful Heiress to the Soveraign Pow'r. Thus—that the People, their Allegiance pay, With such Devotion, as to Heaven they pray. Stand of.—Ye Traytors! Let the Queen be free, And Execute your Cruelty on Me. Hide her—Ye Angels! with your peaceful Wings, Protect the sacred Majesty of Kings. Howe'er of Me, my Fortune may dispose, Oh save Maria, and prevent her Foes. To whom shou'd she account, but You, ye Pow'rs, At whose Tribunal shou'd She stand, but yours? The Doctrine still taught by the ambitious and loose part of the Clergy, that Kings are accountable to none but Heaven, and 'tis without a President, they tell you of Kings being brought to a Bar. Forgetting that Henry III. of France, was summon'd to a Tryal by the Parliament of Paris, under the Protection of the League for the Death of the Duke of Guise, and Cardinal Lorrain, and condemn'd, if he did not appear to answer the Charge in such a time. The whole Process was on record, till Henry IV ordered it to be raz'd out of the Register. Perifixe Histoire de Henry le Grand. Where Justice infinite, with Mercy reigns, And Innocence like hers, the promis'd Crown obtains. Loose Her—Ye Impious! 'tis a Queen you bind, The Greatest, Best and Fairest of her kind. Her Beauty might from Tygers, Pity draw, Her Eyes, all Insolence, but Cecill's awe. Whom wou'd you bring to your Illegal Bar? You madly judge your selves, in judging her. Ye Monarchs! See how they affront the Throne, Assert her Rights, and vindicate your own. In Her, the Rebels wound the Royal Name, The same your Rank, your Wrongs may be the same. Her Suff'rings, shou'd the neighb'ring Crowns alarm, France, and all Europe, to revenge her Arm. Victorious Guise, the Princes of Lorrain, The Sturdy German, and Confederate Spain. To save a Sovereign, or revenge appear, For Faith and Monarchy, are struck in her. No Succour should she want, were Howard free, Nor Hosts nor Heroes, but have all in me. If Earth and Hell, against Maria rose, Norfolk alone, their fury would oppose. Thro' Troops of Rebels, to her aid I'd fly, Or bravely rescue her, or bravely die. Who tamely on a Scaffold, now must Bleed, And forfeit, for suspected Crimes, my Head. Tho what is Death, (The worst our Foes can do,) To Thinking, how it then may fare with You? Death would be welcome, were my Queen secure, The shame, and unconcern'd, I should endure. Soon will the Pain, the Terror soon be o'er, And scarce Maria's Friendship, bless me more. My Soul with pleasure, to her Seat would fly, On Angels Wings, and sing of you on high. Long may your People, in your Reign be blest, Your Charms, your Piety, by all confest. England, when she who envys you is gone, Transported, may advance you to her Throne Like me who loves you, wou'd his Death prefer, To Life, if dying, he might see you there. To you were Fortune, she to me were Kind. For all my wishes, are in yours confin'd. Hear—Hear me Heaven! the Lovely Fair defend, On Heav'n she only must for Help depend. The Listning God has heard my earnest Pray'r, And in Imperial Robes, presents the Fair. My Mind distemper'd, what it hopes, believes. And Love, my Senses, with the Charm deceives. The Clouds are scatter'd, and a Golden Ray, Breaks fiercely forth, to gild the promis'd Day. The Monarch, mounted on her Throne appears, Her Dames around her, and her Loyal Peers. Joy in each Sex, in every Age, is seen, While Crouds, with honest Shouts, salute the Queen She Smiles—Oh whither wou'd my Fancies rove, On me She smiles,—And all the rest is Love. The Joy, too Furious, I can scarce contain, To Madness, it transports my working Brain. Come Cecill, Moreton, with your Ruffians come, Least Rapture kills me, and prevents my Doom. The Splendor dazles, and confounds my Sight, I dream of Day, but wake in horrid Night. The Scene is shifted, and the Vision flies, And Ghastly Forms, and less Delusion rise. Behold, the Royal Excellence is laid, By Guards, surrounded on a sordid Bed, And thence, in solemn Pomp, to Death she's led. Away—Ye rude Companions of Despair, Away—Ye Gloomy Thoughts, to Native Air, They hate the Saint, but durst not hurt the Fair. In vain, Alass! to sooth my Grief I strive, Maria is too great, too good to live. A shining Host of happy Spirits wait, To guide her to a new, a better State. No Tyrants there, nor Traytors can molest, Your Reign Triumphant, and Immortal Rest. Amid the Thrones, I shall behold you first, Your Foes, to Darkness, and Perdition curst. Oh Thou! whose Mercy's boundless as thy Pow'r Forgive this Fury, in my dying Hour. Let my whole Soul attend its sudden Flight, Short be our Passage, and our Burthen light. Enlarge our Patience, and increase our Zeal, Blest, in thy Presence, let us ever dwell. Till there again we meet, Illustrious Queen! Farewel. Mary Queen of the Scots, to the Duke of Norfolk. How shall I write Thee, how my Grief express, My Pity, will the Pains I sooth, encrease. With Horror, Howard, will my Letter see, For all his Troubles are deriv'd from me. From me, his Infamy and Prison came, A Traytor's Sentence, and a hated Name. His Zeal to serve me, has his House undone, First, of his Peers; and second, to the Throne. Thy Fate, Unrighteous, will their Honours wast, And Norfolk, Greatest of his Name, be last. Their mighty Actions, be in thine forgot, And this, which shou'd adorn their Annals, blot. 'Tis thus with Heroes, when the Statesmen rise, For Vice, is Virtue then, and Virtue, Vice. Hadst thou like these, my Royal Claim disown'd, Betray'd my Friendship, and my Fortune shun'd. Great still, and Happy, thou like these hadst been, The Fav'rite Hero of the Virgin Queen. Still Great, tho better in a Grave for Me, Proud Leicester might have charm'd her less than Thee. Far from thy Soul, this dreadful Image drive, And little as thou canst, to hate me, strive. If by my Ruin, I cou'd ransom thine, Our Foes wou'd most have been disturb'd with mine. By endless Terror, and Remorse pursu'd, Their Guilt will on themselves, revenge my Blood. My Soul at Liberty will wing its way, To the blest Regions of Eternal Day. An earthly Crown, contented, I shall leave, Another there, a brighter to receive. With Thrones, Dominions, and the Saints to reign, To know no Danger, and to feel no Pain. And what in Death wou'd terrible appear, Or what cou'd tempt my wandring Wishes here. The World, her Empires, and her Wealth I scorn, For other Ends, and other Tryals born. With Shame and Torture, I shou'd choose to dye, For such my God endur'd, and such shou'd I. No Vile insulting, nor Reproach shou'd move, My Soul preparing for its Flight above. Were Howard safe, transported, I wou'd soar, Beyond all Envy, and descend no more. My Fortunes sink him whom my Love wou'd bless, And sure such Friendship can be nothing less What by this kind Confession wilt thou gain, It comes too late, and sooner had been vain. From Scotland banish'd, and deny'd the Throne, My Love had ruin'd Thee, as soon as known. Poor and Imprison'd, I cou'd ill reward, The Vows you made, and I with Pleasure heard, Had I been free, to give to whom I pleas'd, The Crowns, the Rebels, and my Rival siez'd. As Darnly once, so Norfolk shou'd have sat, On Alban's Throne, and rul'd the Factious State. The Realm obedient, wou'd have own'd her Lord, And fear'd thy Valour, and thy Form ador'd. Thy Native England to thy Yoke had bow'd, Thy Arms have dreaded, and my Claim allow'd. Oh Norfolk! see thy Wishes do not stray, But keep thee safer, tho a rougher way. For Death approaching, shou'd we thus prepare, To hug the Trifles we are leaving here. These golden Vanities we keep in view, And for false Glories, we despise the True. In Scales ill Ballanc'd, we our Losses try, They wou'd weigh lighter, were we fit to die. For Nature wou'd her present Goods possess, And slights a future Crown for this she sees. The doubtful Change she meditates in Tears, And feign with that wou'd part, might this be Hers. Not thus with me—to Heavens Decrees Resign'd, By my past Follies, I've improv'd my Mind. Fair was the promise of my youthful Pride, To Empire born, and mighty Kings ally'd. France early saw me in her Dauphin's Arms, Her first Husband was Francis the Dauphin, and after Francis II, the French King. He died young. As rich in Fortune, as in Native Charms. My self a Queen, my Husband's Hopes were more And Europe jealous of our growing Power. These Visions vanish'd when the Prince was dead And Darnly mounted to my widow'd Bed. Her Second was the Lord Darnly. Love then with better Joys my Bliss encreas'd, Of all in Darnly, I cou'd wish possess'd. His horrid Murder chang'd the gaudy Scene, And now Maria is no more a Queen. Earl Bothwell her third, forc'd to fly to Sweden, to escape the Fury of the People, who wou'd revenge the Death of the Lord Darnly, laid to his Charge. Driv'n from my House, and from my Kingdom forc'd. From him who lov'd me, and I Lov'd divorc'd. Young as I was, and then unus'd to Care, I fled for Safety, and I found it here. For safe in Death, my Soul will be at ease, And find what Scotland had deny'd me, Peace, Oh Norfolk! other ways they might have try'd, As well for them in private, I had dy'd. Daggers or Poyson wou'd have done the deed, And Queens but seldom on a Scaffold bleed. The Pomp of Tryals will not hide their Guilt, Nor Justice be deceiv'd, where Blood is spilt. Less hurt in dying, than an injur'd Name, To justifie their Sentence, they defame. Some were so sawcy as to murmur, as if she knew of the Attempt on her 2d Husband, but they gave no order Reason for't, than because her 3d was suppos'd to be the Assassin. Oh woudst thou think it to my Charge they lay, Such Crimes as Innocence abhors to say. My Husband murder'd, by the Slaves I hir'd, Gifford the Priest confess'd the Scots Queen, was not His, and Babington's Conspiracy. She was a Prisoner 18 Years or more. My Rival's Death, they swear I next conspir'd. Gifford with Moreton, and our Foes combin'd, Declares, with Babington, and him I joynd, To kill their Queen, consented and design'd. Elisa gone to sieze the Brittish Crown, To Thee the Treason he discovers known. Oh Horror! how shall we our Foes forgive, 'Tis hard—but this we must, if we wou'd live. If Mercy from our God, we hope to find, To those who wrong us, we shou'd be as kind. Our God, who ne'er the Penitent refus'd, Wo dy'd to save us, was like us abus'd. A Prison humbles, and Affliction tames, From Passion and Revenge our Hearts reclaims, And purifies our Souls as Metal in the Flames, The Words, which, reigning had been Death to hear, Since grown familiar, I with Patience bear. Chains in a Minute, will improve us more, Than Books or Lessons cou'd in Years before. Monarchs, Instructions from their Slaves despise, And think 'tis Vulgar, to be Learn'd or Wise. With Books, as Children with their Toys they play, Affect to read, as Hypocrites to pray. A shew of Learning, and they need no more, To make their Wisdom dreaded like their Pow'r. With little reading, for too much is dull, A King's a Scholar, and his Slave a Fool. They look on Morals, as below their State, Nor study to be better, till too late. If Twenty tedious Winters they had spent, In loathsome Solitude, and wretched Want. Books then, and Virtue, they like me wou'd find, The best Companions for a sickly Mind. Kings, with Confusion, in my Fate may see, No Prince so mighty, but may fall like me. Once I was Happy, and while Happy, thought, A Monarch never cou'd so low be brought. Now, what is Mystery to them, I know, I ne'er had mounted, but by being low. Of Foes no longer, nor of Death afraid, My Passage easie, by my Hopes is made, Attending Glories, that will never fade, True—Nature thinks 'tis hard to leave a Crown That Heav'n hereafter, may with ease be won. Love tells me Norfolk's Doom is too severe, Nor yet wou'd be content to miss him there. Oh cou'dst thou leave it in a gentler way, 'Twere Cruel in this lower World to stay, And our bright Meeting in the next Delay. EPISTLE VII. Mr. Waller has not made himself more famous for his excellent Vein in Poetry, than for his Love to the Lady Dorothy Sydney, Daughter to my Lord Leicester, and afterwards Countess of Carlisle: Celebrated by him, under the Name of Sacharissa. She was one of the most noted Beauties in the Court of King Charles L. and as proud as She was Fair. There will not be much History expected in these Epistles, the Persons being very little concern'd in the State. Mr. WALLER to the Countess of Carlisle. Thus the bright God, who gilds the Chrystal Skies; Chac'd the Coy Nymph, and thus his Daphne flies, To the fierce Wolf she gives her fleecy Train, Of nothing fearful, but the Deathless Swain. She leaves her little Lambs, her bleating Ewes Hasts to the Village, and the God pursues. He Sings, he Sighs, he follows her in vain, Her Home she leaves, and hyes her to the Plain As fast as Daphne from Apollo flew, From me you fly, and I as fast pursue. If the Nymph heard him touch his Golden Lyre, Nor caught the Flame of his Immortal Fire. What Hopes, you'll listen to my Songs or me, A Mortal I, and you as proud as She. At Court, they tell me, when I seek you there, At Pensburst, I may find our absent Fair. To Pensburst, I pursue the flying Dame, And ever Chacing, ever miss the Game. To Court, she hastens from the Beechen Shade, And shuns the Flowry Walks her Hands have made. The Mountain sports, the Circle at the Green, The Subjects of the May, her self the Queen. The merry Maids she leaves, the jolly Swains, And the gay Pleasures of her Native Plains. To her self Cruel, she consents to be, If else she fears, she must be kind to me. Your Eyes too much ador'd, your Charms desir'd, To shine in Solitude, and Live retir'd. How poor the Service of such humble Swains, When Princes are ambitious of your Chains? Illustrious, like your Beauty, you aspire, To Conquest, and to set the World on Fire. Thus like the Sun, beneath the burning Line, You rather to destroy, than bless us, shine. So fierce, and yet so Beauteous you appear, We wish at once to see you, and we Fear. Jove, will not long your Tyranny endure, Whose Dart's as Fatal, as his Vengeance sure. You brav'd his Fury, and was once compell'd, The Lady Dorothy Sydney, Dowager of my Lord Carlisle. Tho vainly you resisted him, to yield. In Arms Rebellious, you again appear, And press amid the thickest of the War. Where Show'rs of Darts, &amp; pointed Arrows rain, The Danger you despise, the Fight maintain, And ride, a Cruel Pleasure! o'er the slain. You see the Ruins that your Eyes have made, And triumph o'er the Dying, and the Dead. Death, in your soft envenom'd Glances lies, And he that gazes of their Poyson dyes. Happy, to perish by a quick Despair, Whose Life you think so little worth your Care. The killing Smart, contented, he'd endure, Were your Eyes ready as to hurt, to cure. Which like our Indian Plant, at once conceal, To wound, the Venom, and the Balm to heal. Proud of your Fortune, your survey the Spoils, And rule severely, whom you won with Smiles. As Monarchs, giddy with too much Success, By War grow Cruel, who were born for Peace. Love may at last, the destin'd Hero send, The Charm to finish, and our Bondage end. Brave, Young, and Great, for such the Knight must be, Who wins the Dame, and sets the Captives free. As you, your Slaves, so he may you controul, And haughty like your self, command your Soul. Thus the fierce Amazon in Phrygian Fields, Pentheselea, Queen of the Amazons, at the Siege of Troy, was according to the Fable, kill'd by Pyrrhus Son of Achilles. Voiture in his Letters, speaks of the Spanish Beauties, and writ several gallant Poems in the Spanish Tongue, which were taken to be done by their famous Lopez de Vega. Rush'd thro' wing'd Squadrons, and by brazen Shields. Her Arms, her Eyes, the Victor Greeks destroy, And singly she suspends the Fate of Troy. Till Pyrrhus meets her, and her Conquests Bounds, Charms with his Youth, and with his Valour wounds. Far as the Glory of our English Name, Carlisle is worship'd, and the first in Fame. From France, from Italy and Spain they come, To see this Wonder, and receive their Doom Europe and Asia of your Beauties ring, Of these, a happy Theam, the Poets sing, And Foreign Incense to your Altars bring. Voiture, the Gallant, who so well has sung, The same Voiture in his Letter to Mr. Gourdon at London, extolls highly the Beauty of this Lady Carlisle. In their own Language, and adorn'd their Tongue. Of Proud Iberian Dames, whose matchless Eyes, Wou'd shine like Stars, and better light the Skies. To you confesses, they with Shame must yield, By yours, their Beauty and their Pride excell'd. Tho vain and partial, is his Nations Vice, Who every thing, but what is French despise, Carlisle compells him to be just and wise. Montausier Cruel, as he says She's Fair. And Paulet gentle, as her Friend's severe. Both wou'd by your superior Brightness seem, Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, afterwards Dutchess of Montausier, and Mademoiselle Paulet, Voiture's Fav'rite Mistress, very much celebrated by him in his Letters. As much eclips'd, as other look by them. Carlisle he saw, yet own'd he ne'er had seen, Yet far, in search of Beauties he had been, A Dame so perfect, and shou'd ne'er agen. Tho in French Authors we are us'd to meet, Of Words full plenty in a Dearth of Wit. Voiture's Complaint, is yet as just as new, That Words are wanting, when he speaks of you. Weak as their Langurge is, it serves to paint, Their Images imperfect, and as faint. But when like you, a Goddess they behold, The Subject seems in their Surprize, too bold. In English Numbers, and her Native Tongue, Soft as her Graces, like our Passion strong, An English Beauty can be only sung. Their Ladies shining with dissembled Light, Thus War their Heroes, and their Poets write. Their Courage is as false as their Desire, And Vanity in both mistook for Fire. To Love, to Fight, no better Reasons move, Than hopes to have it said, they Fight and Love. In Treason, or in Numbers safe, they dare, And as they Love, thro' Wantonness they war. If Rich their Master and his Slaves appear, They neither matter what indeed they are. The Province bought, his dreadful Arms invade, The King's a Conq'ror, and the Muse well paid. With Pomp, and many Words, his deeds are writ, The Monarch's Conquests, like the Poets wit. More Nations have not, were his Fable true, By the Great Lewis, been enslav'd than you. The Court you chose, a proper Scene to shew, How far the Fairest are excell'd by you. Where sighing Princes at your Feet are seen, And suppliant Crouds adore you as their Queen. For such they think you are, or shou'd have been. By Laws confin'd, an Empire you despise, And uncontroul'd, command us with your Eyes. Kings may our Hands with Iron Fetters bind, With Chains severer, you secure the Mind. Monarchs to save their Subjects, shou'd employ, The Pow'r, which first they did from them enjoy. Carlisle, like Lewis, Conquers to destroy. Too well our want, and your Desert you know, We're still but paying, what you say we owe. Deaf to our Praise, our Services you scorn, They're a just Debt, and merit no Return. Were you less fair, you fewer Slaves wou'd find, And ev'n to those, to keep 'em, must be kind. But when such Numbers to your Temple croud, Our warm Devotion makes the Goddess proud. She sees 'em, unconcern'd, before her fall, Thinks 'tis their Duty, and despises all, In Courts you hope, and Cities to maintain, And spread the Terror of your Tyrant Reign. Love, from Ambition, and from Tumult flies, And in the distant Shade, in Ambush lies. There with the Muses, and the Nymph He plays, Walks in the Meads, or on the Mountain strays. He sits by cooling Springs, he haunts your Bow'rs, And steals upon your soft and silent Hours. As much as you provoke, you dread him there, And where you met him once, to meet him fear. But know—if Love affects to reign in Shades, He oft the Pallace, and the Throne invades. Amid your Guards, you will not be secure, When the God pleases to exert his Pow'r. Your shining Slaves, will only serve to Grace, The Triumphs of the Man he means to bless. Knights, Peers and Princes you may now refuse, For one whom Love will to revenge 'em choose, Without a Title, and without a Muse, The Gentleman who recommended this Subject to me for an Epistle, is so good a Judge, that if I have pleas'd him in the Imitation of Mr. Waller's manner, I am sure the World will be satisfied. I own the attempt bold, and my Success doubtful, but if I may take the Assurances of those Friends who have seen it, I have not much to fear from the Criticks that shall see it hereafter. The Countess of Carlisle to Mr. WALLER. When I first flourish'd in your artful Song, The Lady Carlisle being in Company with Mr. Waller the Duke of Buckingham, and several Persons of the first Rank for Wit and Quality, ask'd him in her elder Years, when he wou'd again write so finely of her, to which Mr. Waller reply'd when her Ladyship was again as young. Fresh was the Beauty, and the Muse was young. The Court was full, the City of my Fame, And the Woods eccho'd Sacharissa's Name, At once delighted, and amaz'd, they view, The shining Picture which your Fancy drew. They cry'd a Goddess, and ador'd the Shrine, The Praise the Painters, and the Worship mine. Your Verse, the Pleasure of the Fair and Great, And both to flatter me your Songs repeat. Such as you made me, I believ'd I was, And try'd your Image by as false a Glass. Their Wonder pleases, and my Youth betrays, For Women are like Wits, bewitch'd with Praise. I leave my Judgment to be rul'd by you, And live, as if I thought the Fable true. I mounted with you in your airy Flight, Kept her in view, and reach'd the Muses height. Still tow'ring upwards on a daring Wing, Nor thought of Falling, while I heard her sing, My Hopes as Glorious, and as few my Fears, I soar'd, and took my Seat among the Stars. In Lustre equal, to their Orbs I reign'd, Commenc'd a Goddess, and the World disdain'd. Crowns from my Feet, &amp; scepter'd Slaves I spurn, And less than an Immortal Lover scorn. The Great, in my Opinion, like the Croud; And him I use the worst, who made me Proud. His Songs at first, created their Esteem, And first I try'd my boasted Pow'r on him. He suffers by the Deity he made, Repents, and wou'd unsay the things he said. His Praise, and their Devotion, I despise, His Love's like theirs, a Tribute to my Eyes. As once an Artist, who a Statue made, Built her a Shrine, and to his Image pray'd. Implor'd the new Divinity in vain, And Curst, and wish'd her in the Log again, While the fierce Goddess, or the Fable lies, The Wretch who form'd her, in her Rage destroys. This, if in Rhimes Rebellious you presume, Again to urge your Merit, is your Doom. This, you expect, for you who make 'em know, What Goddesses provok'd too much can do. Nor is't the Poets Priviledge to take, The Pow'r he gave, and what he made, unmake. Rome's Mitred Vicars, tho their God before, The Saints themselves have Cannoniz'd adore. The Bull with Signet Apostollick sign'd, He's a Saint still, tho friendly or unkind. In your own Language, I assert my Claim, To the first Honours of my Virgin Fame. I hate a sordid Mercenary Muse, Who asks, and murmurs if the Fair refuse. Obedience pure, you've taught me to require, From Interest free, and Guiltless of Desire. A Wit in Love, becomes an errant Fool, And quickly, if he grows sincere, is dull. Fiction's the Life of Poetry, and those, Who boast Sincerity, shou'd speak in Prose. Too well you know it, to be told by me, Verse shou'd be Gay, and Pegasus be free. He trots but heavy, when he steps with Care, And his whole Study is to please his Fair. Not to one Path with tedious Pace confin'd, But various in his Course, and free as Wind, The Muse shou'd sing of all the Charming Kind, Of Flames affected, and her Darts they'll read, Play with the Danger which they else wou'd dread. But if she blazes with a real Fire, The Phœnix Muse may in the Flames expire. Few are the Poets, and the Lovers few, We fear for speaking, or for being true, And none, whom less we shou'd suspect than you. Yet when of Murder, and of Fire you cry So loud, 'tis safest for our Sex to fly. Wits, as of antient Petrarch, 't has been said, Petrarch, who flourish'd in the Year 1370, was a Poet and Canon of Padua, and writes much of a certain Laura, generally believ'd to be an affected Name for an imaginary Beauty. Shou'd dye for some Imaginary Maid, Their Passion Fabulous, and such the Dame, And Laura, serve for all, a common Name. The Nymph Divine, the Goddess you adore, In Rhimes are useful, and shou'd mean no more. The Sighing Shepherds, and the weeping Maids, And Eccho Regent of the moanful Shades. The smiling Graces, and the little Loves, The fairy Pleasures of your silent Groves. Your Streams, your Willows, and the dying Swain, May turn some Melancholly Damsel's Brain. Who reads the Tale with Sympathetick Sighs, And the sad Story wets the Matrons Eyes. But when for something Real 'tis design'd. Your Tears look foolish, and your Sighs are Wind. Your gamesome Circles, and your merry Plays, May speak your Fancy, or a Poem Grace. Yet still the Splendor of a Court will please, While Pride is dearer to our Sex than Ease. Where Flatt'ry most, and where Ambition thrive, The Great will covet, and the Fair to live. To Court the witty, and the Brave repair, For Wit and Valour flourish only there. The Soldiers fight, and best the Poets sing, Warm'd by the Presence of a Mighty King. Charm'd by the Fair, and cherish'd by the Great, Your Fire it quickens, and refines your Wit. Your Sex, have Pensions, Dignities and Pow'rs, Business is yours, you think, and Pleasure ours. As if we ought not in the State to share, And cou'd not be at once both Wise and Fair. Less to our Weakness owing than your Pride, You thought us useless, till our Strength was try'd. Content to hear you flatter us and vain, Too long we suffer'd you alone to Reign. Why may'nt my Lady, summon'd to the Board, As sagely sit, and Councel, as my Lord. 'Tis hard, you will not let 'em there have room, Yet yield 'em up the Government at home. You find us cunning, to your Cost, in Love, In Court Intrigues, we may our Arts improve. 'Tis said, this Lady was a great Caballer in King Charles the first Court, and hearing of the King's Intention to field the Five Members, she gave them notice to escape, which they did. Tho Wit and Politicks but seldom meet, Beauty's more necessary there than Wit. You fear by one Misfortune, 'tis in vain, Mr. Waller was a Member of the Long Parliament and at first zealous for Liberty, but not being Proof against the Temptations of the Court at Oxford, he betray'd the Parliament's Councells to the King, for which he was try'd and convicted, and hardly got off for a Fine of 10000 l. and Banishment which lasted till the Restauration. To tempt by Politicks to rise again. You leave the Court, and seek the Myrtle Grove, And having nothing else to do, you Love. You Write, you Rhime, and when the Song is done, As easie as it came, your Passion's gone. The Dame's made cruel, and the Shepherd true, A fine Employment for a Wit, like you. Full Plenty you, with Laurel may be blest, But Laurel, is a Winter Green at best. Tho happily the Muse may merit Praise, A Crownet, makes a better Shew, than Bays. To Rivers you, and to the Woods resort, As you the Country, I prefer the Court. Besides, if what you say is True, I fear, To find the little God in Ambush there. Like Fairies he, you tell me, haunts the Woods, The Greens, and Dances on the Silver Floods. Invisible to Mortal view, he lies, On Mischief bent, by Force, or by Surprize. 'Tis well you warn'd me, I might else have thought, No Danger, and have ventur'd and been caught. No Groves, no Greens, for Me, if Love is there He comes but seldom to disturb us here. Safe here his Vengeance, and his Threats I'll brave, Live Great, and Free, and be no more a Slave. The Stile of the last Epistle is observ'd in this, and if the Criticks think 'tis not natural in a Woman, let 'em consult the Character of this Lady, and perhaps they will not be so severe.
