      <field name="fulltext">THE English Rechabite: A POEM. I The Backward Spring is o're, and Valentine Was our Memento to abandon Wine: Nature is not grown yet so wondrous old, But she hath wherewithall to keep out cold; Nor need we be beholden to the Grape While we have in our Veins a kinder Sap. II Farewell, thou wadling W?. Sire, thou God, By whom Mens Brains half Pickl'd are, half Sod, Off from your Sign-post, and your Bush pluck down, And sit no longer like the Man i'th' Moon, Lest when the Devil has next his Back-side sing'd He take thee up, and see thee soundly swing'd. III Thou no such Friend to high and lofty Veins, Thou Ottoman stranger to Pindarick strains, Thou health and wealth's exhauster, Reason's Foe, Whose drunken Priests Oaths are ne'r stir, ne'r goe; Yet reel to th' Altar with their Ass and Goat, You found the Kernel for Choakt with a Grape-stone. Anacreon's Throat. IV What art thou Brat of Jove, for whose dear sake Few men in real good much pleasure take? For thy sake once Mount Ida was beguil'd, And Ganimede to an Eagle made a Child; Drink you then Mart. Lib. 1. Epig. 72. Mævia off, and Ida too, We have but one life, though twice born was you. V The Bacchanalia first your self begun, Where thou, in bulk as big, bestrid'st a Tun, Where every brisk Elixir did abound That the Star-Chamber with your Heads ran round; Where had not Venus been most dismal Drunk, Vulcan had never got so fair a Punk. VI 'Tis from your Compotations that her Sails Are hoisted when her Husband's Tackling fails; If she may this Mate cull, and that refuse, Who blames her if the God of War she chuse? Nor wonder if to his Embrace she yield Whose Breast is plated, and whose Back is steel'd. VII What though his Iron-work Nets the Black-smith made, And caught them at their old and wonted Trade Glu'd close in their Embraces, can you think Love will confin'd be to a Cuckold's Link? When Man his Mate would Caterwailing find Link upon Link won't hold; Cat will to kind. VIII Hence Cupid sprang; that little apish Elfe That will the Torch hold, though he burn himself; Whose power and might if once he give the Stroke, None can resist, no not an Heart of Oak: To him we are beholden from above, For Presidents to th' Family of Love. IX 'Twere endless to repeat your mutual Tradings, Your interchanging Gloves at Masqueradings; Breeches for Petticoats, and Shirts for Smocks, And Hair, when hang'd in one anothers Locks: So that Apollo, once famous for his own, By borrowed Curls and Combings now is known. X Your grand Olympick Sultan, ????? ???????? ?????? Parent call'd Of Gods and Men, how many has he enthrall'd? When laying aside his grandure, various Shapes, Incognito, he took for various Rapes; And the Cheat over, so demure would seem, That Juno outrageous has out-thundred him. XI Hence 'tis her Tippet often up is seen, Who would prefer an Heifer to a Queen? Who would, if not by art of Magick led Compress a Swan to spare a Feather-bed? Wine is that mocker irritates to court Though 'twere a Goose, to make the wicked sport. XII Thanks, Bimater, for these, and such like Pranks, For your Autumnal Vintage many Thanks: What day, what hour, if one may freely speak, In which Jove puts not some one to the Squeak? Pluck up your Vines, if nothing else will doe, Rather than tread the Grape and Goddess too. XIII Now to our selves we come, a Generation Well wishing to the act of Propagation, But feeble, and yet if Jove a Rutting goe, Who can expect but Minors should do so? Only betwixt the two here lies the odds, These act sub Dio, clouded act the Gods. XIV Since, Bacchus, then these Jiltings from you spring, Let us the matter to a period bring: What secret Art, what cunning is there us'd By which the cheering grape is so abus'd? You'l say untill it came to Vintner's Bung Nothing by you, but Blood and Stone-Horse Dung. XV By your good favour, give us leave to ask How came your own squeez'd Reisons to the Cask? Your Vine-leaves, Firr? who robs the Acorn-tree? Who puts in Honey to invite the Bee? Your Must was sick forsooth; die let your Wine, Rather than to be heal'd by Turpentine. XVI With it Half-witted Gallants cleanse their Reins, With it does Monsieur ease his twinging Pains; When he Coughs Fe, Fe, with his Teeth half out Madamoiselle she, she brought me to't. When Salivated, yet he dares not scrub, These are the Issues of Love's Poudring Tub. XVII What Metamorphosis is made in Sack When once it comes to undergoe the Rack? Sack out of Rhenish, Rhenish out of White; These are the Trickings call'd when come to Light. Dig deep your Vaults, to hear Beelzebub Yell, This misce, fiat potio came from Hell. XVIII In King and no King's Reign one at Bridge-foot, Yoakt Man and Wife, (and by no Laws could do't) The form (few words are best) John take thou Joan Rather than bite the Sheets and lie alone; But, Justice, was it not a feeling Curse To take their Dash for better and for worse? XIX O Mercury, if thou wast ever kind Send W? back again to speak his mind; Let him but tell the Tithe of what he knows, And high and low shall cancel what he owes; But this alas is vain to set about, The Devil, he kept alive, won't let him do't. XX Speak, Hermes, thou that act'st ubiquitary, Know'st all the Ingredients of the Apothecary; Thou that wast sharer with Mal-Cutpurse once In Plate, Rings, Watches stoln, and precious Stones: Oblige us with the knowledge how 'tis done, That we drink twenty things in tasting one. XXI Hermes.] Though 'tis beneath our Godship to impart Either the Vintner's or Wine-cooper's Art And Mystery, yet since the present Age Has brought us with our Wings upon the Stage, With great applause, what they call Meliorating Is Poys'ning meant, and flat Sophisticating. XXII First Milk, a wholsome Food, from whence some say The Goddesses make Cream i'th' Milky way; Of it a Child may fill his Belly full, Take up his Satchel and away to School: 'Twere otherwise with those of years more ripe If they should suck Sack-posset from the Pipe. XXIII Next, Horse-flesh, though Bucephalus it were, To guzzle down in Tumblers is not fair; What though a Jockie or a Teague can eat Their meager Steeds for want of better Meat, And Colts for Venison, raw, not warm'd with Spice? Our English Men have Palates far more nice. XXIV Molossus, or Bum-Sugar, chuse you which, Invented first by Circe to bewitch; As sweet, as foul and fulsome, what is it But a Confection from th' Infernal Pit? But to make sure work if that chance to fail, They put in fuzzy, thick, new Bottle Ale. XXV Would one not stare to see a Barr-boy come To knock off Alabaster from a Tomb; And taken in the Fact to sneak and whine, And cry, my Master wants it for his Wine. Sirrah, I charge, if he again commands, Thou steal no Flesh of his for whom it stands. XXVI To let Salt, Sulphur, Quick-lime, Turn-stol pass, With Corn decocticated, Izing-glass, The Juice of Sloes, Starch, Allum, Whites of Eggs, Nay, and the very Wine's own Lees and Dregs. These and a thousand such like Tricks are tri'd, But rich that Vessel with a wrank Swine's Hide. XXVII When to the Board comes a Westphalia Ham, How we admire how we commend the same? When as that Sow a Pancake would have lost If something else the Cook-maid out had tost; And that fine Duck we plump and pleasant think, Grew so from Guts and Garbage in the Sink. XXVIII Your Muscadale and your Frontiniack-Bunch Are as destructive as is Brandy-Punch; We meet and drink Time and our selves away, Till we not understand what 'tis we say; Fore-fathers at a Well could quench their thirst, Some spitefull Hag brought hither Clusters first. XXIX When Hannibal with brave Scipio contended, By Vinegar, we reade, he was befriended; So Energetical (belive't who will) It cut through Rocks, and could relent an Hill: It seems in those days Wine had Spirits in't, Can Hockamore or Bagrack flea a Flint? XXX Birch-wine is now come in, and, if Gazette May gain belief, much call'd for at a Treat; O Kent-street, Kent-street, thou art half undone, Westminster Youths will buy Green Twigs or none; An Oratour will else be lost, or Poet, If any Wine flea a Flint 'tis This must doe it. XXXI These things are strange, yet stranger Chymists tell, If Musk decay, Man's Ordure mends the smell; Which to make good if they persist in still, Puss in her Majesty will take it ill: Civet Puss. Unless such circulations Nature make That all things of each other do partake. XXXII How many Load of Muck do Peasants heap On Mother Earth if they intend to reap? And when the Crop is in, they drink and eat, And whistle all out again for Mault and Wheat: That this is naked truth is plain and clear, However, let my Wine be Wine sincere. XXXIII When Sunday comes, and Sexton tolls all in, Out go they for what harm that Week has been; Pox take these Pigeons is their Morning Pray'r, They gorge more Pulse than they are worth this year: But when their Pulse bespeaks a Winding-sheet, Then, Doll, clap quick large Pigeons to my Feet. XXXIV Musmelon is so superfine a thing First-coming 'tis a Present for a King; But when the stubborn Glass denies to break, And Stallion's Nourisher within must wreak, That Sun which in Man's product has a share Sol &amp; Homo generant Hominem. The Causer is of Putrefaction there. XXXV What is Botargo? what is Caveare? (Trash with Exotick words makes Lordly Fare) Both th' Entrals worth two shillings, serv'd up fine, (With Trickings) makes the Reck'ning two pound nine: Ask not particulars; a Shampaign Knight Paid alwaies so; nay, then, the Score goes right. XXXVI Montanus or Crispînus taught the waies To Luxury, continu'd to our daies: Nothing but what costs dear is estimable, Meat from the Shambles is abominable: 'Twas so of old, and we have out-done them; Our Cleopatra's can dissolve a Gemm. XXXVII Who would into his naked Bosome take (If in his wits) a Viper or a Snake? Yet how restorative, without compare True Venice Triacle and Viper Wines declare: Nature made nothing useless, if we knew How kind she is; but that's reveal'd to few. XXXVIII Before the Lazy world is up, too late Your Fishwifes think they trot to Billingsgate; And so would those they buy, for if 'twere known, An Oyster has the like parts with our own; Now Critick smiles, and preaches o're his Wine, Crytick, he has so to An obsolete term for the Sluce call'd Puddle Dock. Port Esquiline. XXXIX These so glib Animals slip down apace, With a course Hand-cloth, and without a Grace; Let Liquor float about the Room, the Oyster Is all in all, when they have robb'd the Cloyster; Scorbutick wretch, hadst thou not Dulman's Brains, A Salt in it to set thee right remains. XL The slimy Snail, if she forsake her Shell, We spurn, or trample on, when we are well; But when Consumptive, and our Lungs half spent, This way for her, and that, are Servants sent. Frogs are an A-la-mode Dish, nay, we find Toads are an Antidote, when well calcin'd. XLI What is an Eele but Slime and Mud when hot? 'Kin to the Snake some think, and some think not, But what rare Bits lodge in the Lamprey-pot? When cut in pieces how they riggle about, As if the Soul was not as yet got out, To clear, that 'tis in ev'ry part, the doubt. XLII The simple Ass Maids laugh at if she Bray, Turning their Heads awry another way; But when they are condemn'd to leave off Silk And put on Flannel, O for Asses Milk! Could she, with Balaam, speak, return would be No, my Dear, no, you make worse noise than we. XLIII The creeping worm, if she but shew her Head Above ground, underneath our Foot we tread; Little regarding, when he comes to die, A Potentate must at her mercy lie: Whose Body we make use of when we live, And find the same, when sick, relief to give. XLIV The Industrious Spider spins not out for nought Her Net-works, that th' unwary Fly be caught, Whose Cobwebs, well disguis'd, we chuse to take Rather than with a tedious Ague shake: As when with Yellow Jaundise we are seiz'd We comb Boys Heads, and with the Bugs are eas'd. XLV The Swallow (a Swift indeed, to disappear, And tarry but the warmer part of th' Year) In Architecture cunning builds her Nest, As if she meant for ever there to rest: But when Physician calls for his supply, Her young ones, like the Phœnix, nobly die. XLVI The Early Crow takes pains to build her Nest, And fights for right if Inmate her infest: 'Twas not for nothing Nature in her Books Set down that Men may make a Meal on Rooks; Men, like their young ones, naked born and bare, Who make it to grow flig their only care. XLVII Now Crytick holds up Hand, and bites his Thumb, Full of Burlesque, while all the rest sit dumb: Poets, quoth he, fare hard, so do not we, They leisure have enough to climb a Tree; For that truth let him meet me by and by, We shall oblige him with a Puppy-pie. XLVIII The Mouse if we find nibling at a Cheese So as to make her Lodgings by degrees, 'Tis tyranny to hamper in a Trap, And interrupt her Breakfast with a snap: Then toss her to the Cat in triumph great, Her Excrements requite for what she eat. XLIX That despicable Animal the Ant, That toils to lay up store while Sluggards want, Scarce Animal to be call'd without a Trope, Scarce visible without a Microscope: This Creature so minute, when he lies ill, Sends the great Monarch man help from her Hill. L Alive, as born for one anothers good, What preparations come from humane Blood? So that when we lie foaming on the Ground, The chiefest remedy from it is found: Nay, further, when we cease to be alive, Others our Brain and grated Scull revive. LI Experiments have of late been made to trie Whether the Man as well as Sheep shall die, By Blood transfus'd; if Patient speak or bleat Our Operatour then has done the Feat; But let Projectours do whate're they can, He is but half a Brute and half a Man. LII To Sun, to Moon, to Mars, to Mercury, Jove, Venus, Saturn in distress we flie: When to be clos'd in her we are afraid, The Bowels of the Earth are open laid For Minerals, that the Microcosm Man May longer live whose Life is but a Span. LIII From Birds, Beasts, Insects, things Inanimate, We Physick take, rather than yield to Fate; What Sublunary things are of that worth, That we should be so long in setting forth? O Mammon, Mammon, what is Mammon pray? Stiff, aggregate, consolidated Clay. LIV The Chimney-sweeper would not work so hard In expectation of a Groat Reward, But take his Soot in kind for Recompence, Knew he how rich a Spirit's drawn from thence; Nor th' Emperour have sold his Subjects Piss Vespasian. So cheap, if he had known what Urine is. LV Your Green Girls Cinders eat and Charcoal bite, Yet neither of these so much the Taste delight; To break a Quinsie if you would make sure, White sifted Album Græcum is the Cure: But nigh the Grapes Blood let no rude hand come, At least exclude that Devil of Devils Stumme. LVI That non-fermenting subterraneous Fiend In Stomach or in Head must work i'th' end; Whence the Tartareous matter there remains, Gives us the Gout when crept into our Veins: Nor wonder then if all things goe not right, When what we take in Red, we let out White. LVII The Paroxysm sure is fierce and strong That quite bereaves the Patient of his Tongue; Patient indeed, who sensibly can feel That in his Hand was Yesterday in's Heel; And very truly is he said o'retaken, That of his nimble Feet is quite forsaken. LVIII Great Alexander never did intend To make a passage to his Bosome Friend; But he to whom the World too little was, Was conquered by a Multiplying Glass: Had Oloferues ne'r been steept in Wine Judeth had fail'd in her resolv'd design. LIX The Nazarite forbid to taste the Vine, When Champian made against the Philistine, E're he had thoughts to take his latest Breath, Did them a Courtesie before his Death: Not Lullaby'd, nor Shorn, nor yet made Blind, He took care Vineyards should not stay behind. LX Close-fisted Nabal made the matter worse, That at his best his Heart was in his Purse; If askt when Fasting, he had Grunted No, The Nature of the Beast was to do so; But to deny a King part of his Feast, This made the Drunken Churl a branded Beast. LXI Pharaoh's chief Butler had by th' Neck been ti'd, Had he not had a Proverb on his side; Rabbins expound, we seldom suffer harm From Beveridge large in which there is no Barm: But the poor Kneader (malis avibus) For a dull dreaming Soul was fain to truss. LXII Must Edenborough new London Town exceed, And Thamisis be quite run down by Tweed? Barkley had never had his Brains refin'd, Had he not got true Liquor to his mind. To Brew the Grape and equal it with Beer Is Felony in Scotland, why not here? LXIII The Vintner then at Algate merits praise, In Cypress clad his Sign and sable Bays; A Signal token of remorse within For his Adulterating, Blending sin; Unless by a Prophetick Vision told, No Vin de boon in England to be sold. LXIV That Drawer at Oxon who in rage let flie Three Sack-buts, wading in it Ancle high, Knew what he did, and if well understood, 'Twas for the publick Universal good: Set free at last from some years hard restraint, Let him be Canoniz'd the Maudlen Saint. POSTSCRIPT. LXV Mirth madness is, all pleasant thoughts adieu If the foregoing Stories hold out true; What Pigmies must that dumpish Age produce, In which Men are debarr'd enabling Juice? Yet, Quære, if Bacchus put by this Nights sorrow, If it will not return with force to Morrow? LXVI When Hospitality was kept i'th' Hall, And over Rump and Chine did Beards wag all, When the Black Jack and Horn went quick about, And Tenants warn'd to pay their Rent could do't, Men begat Men: now Bath, Wine, Musick, Miss, Are all we care for, our Delight and Bliss. LXVII Yet lest some who to Mahomet incline, In Coffee and Opium trade in stead of Wine, Take Wives sans number, dream of Paradise, And Virgins with black, bright, full, rouling Eyes. Your Vessel know, then drink Sack, Pint one half, Remembring, Ben. Johnson's constant Morning Ejaculation for his dearly beloved self, and his as dear Drawer. God bless me, and God bless Ralph.
