      <field name="fulltext">I TO A LADY Daughter of Ireland,—nay, 'twere better said, Daughter of Ireland's beauty, Ireland's grace, Child of her charm, of her romance; whose face Is legendary with her glories fled! The shadow of her living griefs and dead I pray you to put by a little space, And mourn with me an ancient Orient race Outcast and doomed and disinherited. Though Wrong be strong, though thrones be built on crimes, To know you, Lady, is to doubt no more That in the world are mightier powers than these; That heaven, the ocean, gains on earth, the shore; And that deformity and hate are Time's, And love and loveliness Eternity's. II THE TURK IN ARMENIA What profits it, O England, to prevail In arts and arms, and mighty realms subdue, And ocean with thine argosies bestrew, And wrest thy tribute from each golden gale, If idly thou must hearken to the wail Of women martyred by the turbaned crew Whose tenderest mercy was the sword that slew, And hazard not the dinting of thy mail? We deemed of old thou held'st a charge from Him Who sits companioned by His seraphim, To smite the wronger with thy destined rod. Wait'st thou His sign? Enough, the unanswered cry Of virgin souls for vengeance, and on high The gathering blackness of the frown of God! III IGNOBLE EASE Never henceforth, O England, nevermore Prate thou of generous effort, righteous aim, Whose shame is that thou knowest not thy shame! Summer hath passed, and Autumn's threshing-floor Been winnowed; Winter at Armenia's door Snarls like a wolf; and still the sword and flame Sleep not; thou only sleepest; and the same Cry unto heaven ascends as heretofore; And the red stream thou might'st have staunched, yet runs: And roused by no divinely beckoning Wraith, Stirred by no clarion blowing loud and wide, Lost in ignoble ease, behold thy sons, Sitting among the shards of broken faith, And by the ruins of forgotten pride. IV THE PRICE OF PRESTIGE You in high places; you that drive the steeds Of Empire; you that say unto our hosts, “Go thither,” and they go; and from our coasts Bid sail the squadrons, and they sail, their deeds Shaking the world: lo! from a land that pleads For mercy where no mercy is, the ghosts Look in upon you faltering at your posts— Upbraid you parleying while a People bleeds To death. What stays the thunder in your hand? A fear for England? Can her pillared fame Only on faith forsworn securely stand, On faith forsworn that murders babes and men? Are such the terms of Glory's tenure? Then Fall her accursed greatness, in God's name! V HOW LONG? Heaped in their ghastly graves they lie, the breeze Sickening o'er fields where others vainly wait For burial: and the butchers keep high state In silken palaces of perfumed ease. The panther of the desert, matched with these, Is pitiful; beside their lust and hate, Fire and the plague-wind are compassionate, And soft the fang'd lips of the ravening seas. How long shall they be borne? Is not the cup Of crime yet full? Doth devildom still lack Some consummating crown, that we hold back The scourge, and in Christ's borders give them room? How long shall they be borne, O England? Up, Tempest of God, and sweep them to their doom! VI REPUDIATED RESPONSIBILITY I had not thought to hear it voiced so plain, Uttered so forthright, on their lips who steer This nation's course: I had not thought to hear That word re-echoed by an English thane, Guilt's maiden-speech when first a man lay slain, “Am I my brother's keeper?” Yet full near It sounded, and the syllables rang clear As the immortal rhetoric of Cain. “Wherefore should we, sirs, more than they—or they— Unto these helpless reach a hand to save?” An English thane, in this our English air, Speaking for England? Then indeed her day Slopes to its twilight, and, for Honour, there Is needed but a requiem, and a grave. VII A HURRIED FUNERAL A little deeper, sexton. You forget, She you would bury 'neath so thin a crust Of loam, was fiery-souled, and ev'n in dust She may lie restless, she may toss and fret, Nay, she might break a seal too lightly set, And vex, unmannerly, our ease! She must Beneath no lack of English earth lie thrust, Would we unhaunted sleep! Nay, deeper yet. Quick, friend, the cortège comes. There—that will serve; Deep enough now; and thou'lt need all thy nerve, If, in her coffin, at the last, amid The mourners in the customary suits, And to the scandal of these decent mutes, This corpse of England's Honour burst the lid! VIII ENGLAND TO AMERICA O towering daughter, Titan of the West, Behind a thousand leagues of foam secure; Thou toward whom our inmost heart is pure Of ill intent: although thou threatenest With most unfilial hand thy mother's breast, Not for one breathing-space may Earth endure The thought of War's intolerable cure For such vague pains as vex to-day thy rest! But if thou hast more strength than thou canst spend In tasks of Peace, and find'st her yoke too tame, Help us to smite the cruel, to befriend The succourless, and put the false to shame. So shall the ages laud thee, and thy name Be lovely among nations to the end. IX A BIRTHDAY It is the birthday of the Prince of Peace: Full long ago He lay with steeds in stall, And universal Nature knew through all Her borders that the reign of Pan must cease. The fatness of the land, the earth's increase, Cumbers the board; the holly hangs in hall; Somewhat of her abundance Wealth lets fall; It is the birthday of the Prince of Peace. The dead rot by the wayside; the unblest Who live, in caves and desert mountains lurk Trembling, His foldless flock, shorn of their fleece. Women in travail, babes that suck the breast, Are spared not. Famine hurries to her work. It is the birthday of the Prince of Peace. X THE TIRED LION Speak once again, with that great note of thine, Hero withdrawn from Senates and their sound Unto thy home by Cambria's northern bound, Speak once again, and wake a world supine. Not always, not in all things, was it mine To follow where thou led'st: but who hath found Another man so shod with fire, so crowned With thunder, and so armed with wrath divine? Lift up thy voice once more! The nation's heart Is cold as Anatolia's mountain snows. Oh, from these alien paths of base repose Call back thy England, ere thou too depart— Ere, on some secret mission, thou too start With silent footsteps, whither no man knows. XI THE BARD-IN-WAITING Treachery's apologist, whose numbers rung, But yesterday, remonstrant in my ear; Thou to whom England seems a mistress dear, Insatiable of honey from thy tongue: Because I crouch not fawning slaves among, How is my service proved the less sincere? Have not I also deemed her without peer? Her beauty have not I too seen and sung? But for the love I bore her lofty ways, What were to me her stumblings and her slips? And lovely is she still, her maiden lips Pressed to the lips whose foam around her plays! But on her brow's benignant star whose rays Lit them that sat in darkness, lo! the eclipse. XII LEISURED JUSTICE “She bides her hour.” And must I then believe That when the day of peril is o'erpast, She who was great because so oft she cast All thought of peril to the waves that heave Against her feet, shall greatly undeceive Her purblind son who dreamed she shrank aghast From Duty's signal, and shall act at last, When there is naught remaining to retrieve? At last! when the last altar is defiled, And there are no more maidens to deflower— When the last mother folds with famished arms To her dead bosom her last butchered child— Then shall our England, throned beyond alarms, Rise in her might! Till then, “she bides her hour.” XIII THE PLAGUE OF APATHY The dewfall of compassion, is it o'er So soon? So soon is dead indifference come? From wintry sea to sea the land lies numb. With palsy of the spirit stricken sore, The land lies numb from iron shore to shore. The unconcerned, they flourish: loud are some, And without shame. The multitude stand dumb. The England that we vaunted is no more. Only the witling's sneer, the worldling's smile, The weakling's tremors, fail him not who fain Would rouse to noble deed. And all the while, A homeless people, in their mortal pain, Toward one far and famous ocean isle Stretch hands of prayer, and stretch those hands in vain. XIV THE KNELL OF CHIVALRY O vanished morn of crimson and of gold, O youth of roselight and romance, wherein I read of paynim and of paladin, And Beauty snatched from ogre's dungeoned hold! Ever the recreant would in dust be rolled, Ever the true knight in the joust would win, Ever the scaly shape of monstrous Sin At last lie vanquished, fold on writhing fold. Was it all false, that world of princely deeds, The splendid quest, the good fight ringing clear? Yonder the Dragon ramps with fiery gorge, Yonder the victim faints and gasps and bleeds; But in his merry England our St. George Sleeps a base sleep beside his idle spear. XV TO RUSSIA Russia that wast the opener of the door Through which the captive peoples went forth freed; How art thou changed and fall'n, who giv'st no heed Though in the dust a nation stricken sore Dies at thy feet; though the red torrents pour Continual, and to stay them does but need Thy whisper, thy “Enough!” O fall'n indeed, Russia the Liberator now no more! Hear thou a parable. A savage hound Did rend a babe; and one that with a word Or gesture could have called the brute to heel, Stood watching; and behold he never stirred A finger, and his lips vouchsafed no sound. Shall hound or man God's heaviest judgment feel? XVI A TRIAL OF ORTHODOXY The clinging children at their mother's knee Slain; and the sire and kindred one by one Flayed or hewn piecemeal; and things nameless done, Not to be told: while imperturbably The nations gaze, where Rhine unto the sea, Where Seine and Danube, Thames and Tiber run, And where great armies glitter in the sun, And great kings rule, and man is boasted free! What wonder if yon torn and naked throng Should doubt a Heaven that seems to wink and nod, And having moaned at noontide, “Lord, how long?” Should cry, “Where hidest Thou?” at evenfall, At midnight, “Is He deaf and blind, our God?” And ere day dawn, “Is He indeed at all?” XVII “IF” Yea, if ye could not, though ye would, lift hand— Ye halting leaders—to abridge Hell's reign; If, for some cause ye may not yet make plain, Yearning to strike, ye stood as one may stand Who in a nightmare sees a murder planned And hurrying to its issue, and though fain To stay the knife, and fearless, must remain Madly inert, held fast by ghostly band;— If such your plight, most hapless ye of men! But if ye could and would not, oh, what plea, Think ye, shall stead you at your trial, when The thunder-cloud of witnesses shall loom, With Ravished Childhood on the seat of doom, At the Assizes of Eternity? XVIII A WONDROUS LIKENESS Still, on Life's loom, the infernal warp and weft Woven each hour! Still, in august renown, A great realm watching, under God's great frown! Ever the same! The little children cleft In twain: the little tender maidens reft Of maidenhood! And through a little town A stranger journeying, wrote this record down, “In all the place there was not one man left.” O friend, the sudden lightning of whose pen Makes Horror's countenance visible afar, And Desolation's face familiar, I think this very England of my ken Is wondrous like that little town, where are In all the streets and houses no more men. XIX STARVING ARMENIA Open your hearts, ye clothed from head to feet, Ye housed and whole, who listen to the cry Of them that not yet slain and mangled lie, Only despoiled of all that made life sweet— Only left bare to snow, and wind, and sleet, And roofless to the inhospitable sky. Give them of your abundance, lest they die, And famine make this mighty woe complete; And lest—if truly, as your creeds aver, A day of reckoning come—it be your lot To hear the voice of the uprisen dead: “We were the naked whom ye covered not, The sick to whom ye did not minister, Yea, and the hungry whom ye gave not bread.” XX TO THE SULTAN Caliph, I did thee wrong. I hailed thee late “Abdul the Damned,” and would recall my word. It merged thee with the unillustrious herd Who crowd the approaches to the infernal gate— Spirits gregarious, equal in their state As is the innumerable ocean bird, Gannet or gull, whose wandering plaint is heard On Ailsa or Iona desolate. For, in a world where cruel deeds abound, The merely damned are legion: with such souls Is not each hollow and cranny of Tophet crammed? Thou with the brightest of Hell's aureoles Dost shine supreme, incomparably crowned, Immortally, beyond all mortals, damned. XXI ON THE REPORTED EXPULSION OF AHMED RIZA BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT When, from supreme disaster, France uprose, Shook her great wings and faced the world anew, Who, if not we, rejoiced at heart to view Her proud resilience after mightiest woes? When 'neath the anarch's knife we saw the close Of Carnot's day, amid her weepings who Wept if not we, for the just man and true That masked his strength in most urbane repose? And now again we mourn, but not with her, Nay, not with her, though for her!—mourn to see A tyrant, Hell's most perfect minister, A man-fiend, sun him in her countenance; And Freedom, whose impassioned name was France, Lie soiled and desecrate by France the Free. XXII ON A CERTAIN EUROPEAN ALLIANCE The Hercules of nations, shaggy-browed, Enormous-limbed, supreme on Steppe and plain Dwelt without consort, in his narrow brain Nursing wide dreams he might not dream aloud; Till him the radiant western Venus vowed (So strange is love!) she pined for: and these twain Were wedded—Neptune, with his nereidtrain, Gracing the pageant of their nuptials proud. Perfect in amorous arts, through eyes and ears She fans her giant's not too fierce desire. “How long, O Venus? What impassioned years, What ages of such rapture, ere thou tire?” Thus the lewd gods: thus Mars and all his peers, Gazing profane, at fault 'twixt mirth and ire. XXIII TO OUR SOVEREIGN LADY Queen, that from Spring to Autumn of Thy reign Hast taught Thy people how 'tis queenlier far Than any golden pomp of peace or war, Simply to be a woman without stain! Queen whom we love, Who lovest us again! We pray that yonder, by Thy wild Braemar, The lord of many legions, the White Czar, At this red hour, hath tarried not in vain. We dream that from Thy words, perhaps Thy tears, Ev'n in the King's inscrutable heart, shall grow Harvest of succour, weal, and gentler days! So shall Thy lofty name to latest years Still loftier sound, and ever sweetlier blow The rose of Thy imperishable praise. XXIV THE AWAKENING Behold, she is risen who lay asleep so long, Our England, our Belovèd! We have seen The swelling of the waters, we have heard The thundering cataracts call. Behold, she is risen, Lovelier in resurrection than the face Of vale or mountain, when, with storming tears, At all Earth's portals knocks the importunate Spring. We watched her sleeping. Day and night we strove With the dread spell that drowsed her heart. And thrice In the unrest of her sick dreams she stirred, Half raised herself, half oped her lips and lids, And thrice the evil charm prevailed, and thrice She fell back forceless. But behold, she is risen, The Hope of the World is risen, is risen anew. O England! O Belovèd! O Re-born! Look that thou fall not upon sleep again! Thou art a star among the nations yet: Be thou a light of succour unto them That else are lost in blind and whelming seas. Around them is the tempest; over them, Cold splendours of the inhospitable night, Augustly unregardful: thou alone Art still the North Star to the labouring ship, In friendless ocean the befriending orb, And if thou shine not, whither is she steered? Shine in thy glory, shine on her despair, Shine lest she perish—lest of her no more Than some lorn flotsam of mortality Remain to catch the first auroral gleam, When, in the East, flames the reluctant dawn. XXV HOW WEARY IS OUR HEART Of kings and courts; of kingly, courtly ways In which the life of man is bought and sold; How weary is our heart these many days! Of ceremonious embassies that hold Parley with Hell in fine and silken phrase, How weary is our heart these many days! Of wavering counsellors neither hot nor cold, Whom from His mouth God speweth, be it told How weary is our heart these many days! Yea, for the ravelled night is round the lands, And sick are we of all the imperial story. The tramp of Power, and its long trail of pain; The mighty brows in meanest arts grown hoary; The mighty hands, That in the dear, affronted name of Peace Bind down a people to be racked and slain; The emulous armies waxing without cease, All-puissant all in vain; The pacts and leagues to murder by delays, And the dumb throngs that on the deaf thrones gaze; The common, loveless lust of territory; The lips that only babble of their mart, While to the night the shrieking hamlets blaze; The bought allegiance, and the purchased praise, False honour, and shameful glory;— Of all the evil whereof this is part, How weary is our heart, How weary is our heart these many days! XXVI EUROPE AT THE PLAY O languid audience, met to see The last act of the tragedy On that terrific stage afar, Where burning towns the footlights are,— O listless Europe, day by day Callously sitting out the play! So sat, with loveless count'nance cold, Round the arena, Rome of old. Pain, and the ebb of life's red tide, So, with a calm regard, she eyed, Her gorgeous vesture, million-pearled, Splashed with the blood of half the world. High was her glory's noon: as yet She had not dreamed her sun could set! As yet she had not dreamed how soon Shadows should vex her glory's noon. Another's pangs she counted nought; Of human hearts she took no thought; But God, at nightfall, in her ear Thundered His thought exceeding clear. Perchance in tempest and in blight, On Europe, too, shall fall the night! She sees the victim overborne, By worse than ravening lions torn. She sees, she hears, with soul unstirred, And lifts no hand, and speaks no word, But vaunts a brow like theirs who deem Men's wrongs a phrase, men's rights a dream. Yet haply she shall learn, too late, In some blind hurricane of Fate, How fierily alive the things She held as fool's imaginings, And, though circuitous and obscure, The feet of Nemesis how sure.</field>
