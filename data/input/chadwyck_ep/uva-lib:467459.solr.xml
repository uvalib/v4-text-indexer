      <field name="fulltext">The Guardian Angel. âWe never meet them in our paths, They never cross our ways, God's angels are not now on earth, As in the olden days.â The young man spake in careless mood.â Slowly his silver head The grey-haired dalesman lifted up, And thoughtful answerÃ©d. âWe had a little shepherd maid, She was not six years old; Why sayest thou, the veil between The visible, and things unseen, May never be unrolled? âShe dwelt amid these upland downs, Untaught of men or books, Alone with Nature all day long, Her shadows and her brooks. âA few loved words in church-time learnt, Were comrades to the child, And prayer and psalm-tune haunted her, Along the lonely wild. âShe was as fearless in her soul, As innocent of heart, And safe in her own simple trust, Dwelt with God's things apart. âThe wintry path was white with snow, Her father, through the dark, Has caught his cottage window's gleam, And blessed the tiny spark. âNo little lips with kisses warm, Have bade him welcome home: âGood mother, where is my poor child? This was no day to roam.â ââThe child has sought the upland farm,â The mother said; and to and fro She paced the room uneasily, And in an earnest tone spake she, (As though that sad thing might not be, Whereto her lip would not agree,) âNot in this driving snow, ââThey would not let my darling forth, The dame is kind and free, The farmer hath a father's heart, She is as safe as we.â âIn vain, within the chimney nook, She sets his wicker chair, And draws the white-clothed table forth, And brings his supper there. âHe looks upon the little stool, His favourite corner near, And saith, âThe snow-drift chokes the pane; I would the child were here.â âThe mother sitteth opposite, Her baby on her knee, And looks into his anxious eyes, And chokes the rising sob, and cries, âShe is as safe as we.â âSlowly and cold the evening hours Passed over the white earth, While the two sat with doubtful hearts, Beside their lonely hearth. âAnd one, or other, would look forth, And cry, âIt snows not overhead,â Then sit again, and smiling say, âThere is no cause for dread.â âBut oft that night in restless sleep, The father muttered low, âThe path is wild, the drift is deep, My child is in the snow.â âAnd then the wakeful mother laid Her hand upon his breast, And cried, âThe child is safe from harm, She sleepeth soundly at the farm, Why art thou so distressed?â âThe sullen morn breaks slow at last, And both are on the watch, Hark! there's a whistle through the gloom, A hand upon the latch. âYoung Richard from the upland farm Has waded through the snow, âUp, shepherd, up; two sheep of ours Were in the vale below; ââI told the child when yesternoon She left my father's door,ââ Why does the father shuddering stand? Why does the mother wring her hand? He looketh round in sudden fear, A little empty crib stands near, He needs not question more. âFew words, brief answer; she had left The upland farm at noon, With merry laugh, and voice that cried, She would have shelter soon. âThe snow lay deep along the path, But all the sky was clear, Nor yet the stormy wind was up, And the child felt no fear. âThey never doubted, long before The drifts were driven so deep, The little weary one would be In her own bed asleep. âThe father looked in Richard's face, And caught his spade in haste; The first red streaks of struggling dawn Broke o'er the level waste. âAnd Richard from the mother took The cordials she would give, And inly sighed, â'Tis possible Yet the poor child may live.â âThe vexing wind hath ceased to chide; One sheet of leaden hue The sky hung o'er them, with few streaks Of purple breaking through. âThey passed the tuft of birchen trees, They passed the traveller's stone, By the green hawthorn, green no more, Where oft the maiden lone âIn summer-time her garlands wove, And plucked the berries bright;â The youth has touched the father's arm, And guided his dim sight. âFor under the half-buried tree, A miserable shade, (The snow-drift had not covered them) Were little footprints made. âThe youth has tracked them eagerly, âThe sheep-fold on the height, The child has sought its sheltering wall:â The father grew more white. ââAlas! alas! the quick rough stream, The quarry, old and deep, Without a guide, without a track, She would not climb the steep.â âThey followed onward silently, Still o'er the trackless way; Like scattered stars to guide them on, The little footsteps lay. âThey hear the stream run hoarse and deep, Its shaggy banks between, So closely met, so piled with snow, The bridge is scarcely seen. âBut straight across the narrow plank, And up the steep ascent, Without a miss, without a slip, The little footsteps went. âAnd by the old mine's yawning mouth, And all the gulf along, So close, one step had ended all; But not one step went wrong. âThey followed o'er the level waste, A track as straight and true, As though her eyes had seen the path, That wound the heather through. âAnd where the moorland herds had reared Rude shelter for their sheep, Rough stones with shingles covered o'er, They found the child asleep. âBut who can tell her waking joy? The rapture of the sire?â And this the child's unprompted tale Myself have heard, and all the dale, Told many a night when cheeks grew pale, Around the cottage fire. ââThe upland moor was all so white, My path I scarcely knew, And in my face the cold north wind The glittering snow-drift blew. ââI could not call, I could not see, My very breath was gone; I tied the kerchief o'er my face, And slowly struggled on. ââI think it might be two long hours, Two hours perchance, or three, I turned myself around, and tried To find where I might be. ââI stood beside the hawthorn tree, I knew it was the same, From ribands that we tied thereon, When last the May-day came. ââThere was a space beneath its boughs Not yet quite covered o'er, I crept therein to rest awhile, For I was wearied sore. ââI heard my own teeth chattering, The night was gathering round; I crouched into the cold hard tree, I crouched into the ground. ââI thought, perchance, that father's path Lay this way o'er the wold, It was so far away from home, And I so bitter cold. ââBut fast the clouds formed up in heaven, Deep fell the darkening shade, Like curtains round the great white earth, And I did grow afraid. ââAnd hoarser howled the strong fierce wind Along the moorland bare; I tried to clasp my two cold hands, And say our Lord's Own Prayer. ââAnd when I did look up, that God Might hear me as I prayed, O, mother dear, a little boy Was coming to my aid. ââA little shepherd boy he seemed, But strange to me his mien, I never saw him on the heath, Or met him on the green. ââHe spoke no word, but looked at me With eyes so bright and sweet, And then with gentle gesture raised, And set me on my feet. ââHe beckoned with his little hand, That was as white as snow: Methought I could have followed him Wherever he would go. ââAnd by the brook, and o'er the bridge, And by the quarried stone, He led all up the dangerous path I fear to tread alone. ââAnd when I wearied on the steep, Or trembled in the blast, He put his two arms round me then, And held me close and fast. ââAnd when within the moorland fold Sheltered and housed I lay, He wrapped me close with tender touch, And then he went away.â âIn silent awe, we looked to Heaven, Hearing the maiden's word, And Richard said, âThe child has seen An Angel of the Lord.â âGo thou, and if thine heart have scorned, And if thy lip have smiled, Learn gentler thought, and holier dream; The spirit of a child. ââGo, learn their love, who conscious still Of Saintly commune dear, Walk gently on their earthly path, With Heaven around them here; ââWho deem the Great God's sheltering wing, O'er all the wide earth broods, And His bright Angels wander through His holy solitudes; âWho deem the sun has brightest hues, For newly watered flowers, And eyes just washed in Heaven's own dew, See more perchance than ours. âGo, school thy speech, make pure thine heart, Lest word or thought of pride Should scare away the beings bright, That wander at thy side.â</field>
