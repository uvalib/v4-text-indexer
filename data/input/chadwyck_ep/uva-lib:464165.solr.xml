      <field name="fulltext">II. Festival Hymns. “I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.” [1 Corinthians xiv. 15. G.] HYMNS CELEBRATING THE MYSTERIES AND CHIEF FESTIVALS OF THE YEAR, ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH: FITTED TO THE FANCY AND DEVOTION OF THE YOUNGER AND PIOUS PERSONS, Apt for memory, and to be joyned to their other PRAYERS. Hymns for Advent, or the weeks immediately before the Birth of our blessed Saviour. 1. [When Lord, O when shall we] When Lord, O when shall we Our dear salvation see? Arise, arise, Our fainting eyes Have long'd all night; and 'twas a long one too. Man never yet could say He saw more then one day, One day of Eden's seven: The guilty hours there blasted with the breath Of Sin and Death, Have ever since worn a nocturnal hue. But Thou hast given us hopes that we At length another day shall see, Wherein each vile neglected place, Gilt with the aspect of Thy face, Shall be like that, the porch and gate of Heaven. How long, dear God, how long! See how the nations throng: All humane kinde Knit and combin'd Into one body, look for Thee their Head. Pity our multitude; Lord we are vile and rude, Headless and sensless without Thee, Of all things but the want of Thy blest face; O haste apace! And Thy bright Self to this our body wed, That through the influx of Thy power, Each part that er'st confusion wore May put on order, and appear Spruce as the childhood of the year, When Thou to it shalt so united be. Amen. The Second Hymn for Advent; or Christ's coming to Jerusalem in Triumph. Lord come away, Why dost Thou stay? Thy rode is ready; and Thy paths, made strait, With longing expectation, wait The consecration of Thy beauteous feet. Ride on triumphantly; behold we lay Our lusts and proud wills in Thy way. Hosanna! welcome to our hearts! Lord, here Thou hast a temple too, and full as dear As that of Sion, and as full of sin: Nothing but thieves and robbers dwel therein, Enter, and chase them forth, and cleanse the floore; Crucifie them, that they may never more Profane that holy place Where Thou hast chose to set Thy face. And then if our stiff tongues shall be Mute in the praises of Thy Deity; The stones out of the Temple-wall Shall cry aloud and call Hosanna! and Thy glorious footsteps greet. Amen. Hymns for Christmas-day. 1. [Mysterious truth! that the self-same should be] Mysterious truth! that the self-same should be A Lamb, a Shepherd, and a Lion too! Yet such was He Whom first the shepherds knew, When they themselves became Sheep to the Shepherd-Lamb. Shepherd of men and angels, Lamb of God, Lion of Judah, by these titles keep The wolf from Thy indangered sheep. Bring all the world unto Thy fold, Let Jews and Gentiles hither come In numbers great that can't be told, And call Thy lambs that wander, home. Glory be to God on high, All glories be to th'glorious Deity. The Second Hymn; being a Dialogue between Three Shepherds. Where is this blessed Babe That hath made All the world so full of joy And expectation; That glorious Boy That crowns each nation With a triumphant wreath of blessedness? Where should He be but in the throng, And among His angel-ministers, that sing And take wing Just as may echo to His voyce, And rejoyce When wing and tongue and all May so procure their happiness? But He hath other waiters now; A poor cow, An ox and mule stand and behold, And wonder, That a stable should enfold Him that can thunder. Chorus. O what a gracious God have we! How good? how great? Even as our misery. The Third Hymn: of Christ's Birth in an June. The blessed virgin travail'd without pain, And lodgèd in an inne; A glorious star the sign, But of a greater guest then ever came that way; For there He lay That is the God of night and day, And over all the pow'rs of heaven doth reign. It was the time of great Augustus tax, And then He comes That pays all sums, Even the whole price of lost humanity; And set us free From the ungodly emperie Of sin, and Satan, and of death. O make our hearts, blest God, Thy lodging-place, And in our brest Be pleas'd to rest, For thou lov'st temples better then an inne, And cause that sin May not profane the Deity within, And sully o're the ornaments of grace. Amen. [The Fourth] Hymn for Christmas Day. Awake, my soul, and come away! Put on thy best array; Least if thou longer stay, Thou lose some minitts of so blest a day. Goe run, And bid good morrow to the sun: Welcome his safe return, to Capricorn; And that great morne Wherein a God was borne, Whose story none can tell But He Whose every word's a miracle. To-day Almightiness grew weak; The Worde itself was mute, and could not speak. That Jacob's star Which made the sun To dazle if he durst look on, Now mantled ore in Beth'lem's night, Borrowed a star to shew Him light. He that begirt each zone, To Whom both poles are one, Who grasp't the Zodiack in's hand And made it move or stand, Is now by nature man, By stature but a span; Eternitie is now grown short; A King is borne without a court; The water thirsts; the fountain's dry; And Life being borne, made apt to dye. Chorus. Then let our prayers emulate and vie With His humilitie: Since Hee's exil'd from skeyes That we might rise,— From low estate of men Let's sing Him up agen! Each man winde up's heart To bear a part In that angelick quire, and show His glory high as He was low! Let's sing t'wards men good wil and charity, Peace upon Earth, glory to God on high Hallelujah, Hallelujah! A Hymn upon St John's day. This day We sing The friend of our eternal King: Who in His bosome lay. And kept the keys Of His profound and glorious mysteries: Which to the world dispensèd by his hand, Made it stand Fix'd in amazement to behold that light Which came From the throne of the Lamb, To invite Our wretched eyes—which nothing else could see But fire, and sword, hunger and miserie— To anticipate by their ravish'd sight The beauty of celestial delight. Mysterious God, regard me when I pray: And when this load of clay Shall fall away, O let Thy gracious hand conduct me up, Where on the Lamb's rich viands I may sup: And in this last Supper I May with Thy friend in Thy sweet bosome lie For ever in Eternity. Allelujah. Upon the Day of the Holy Innocents. Mournful Iudah shreeks and cries At the obsequies Of their babes, that cry More that they lose the paps, then that they die. He that came with life to all, Brings the babes a funeral, To redeem from slaughter Him Who did redeem us all from sin. They like Himself went spotless hence, A sacrifice to Innocence; Which now does ride Trampling upon Herod's pride: Passing from their fontinels of clay To heaven, a milky and a bloody way. All their tears and groans are dead And they to rest and glory fled. Lord, Who wert pleased so many babes should fall Whil'st each sword hop'd that every of the all Was the desirèd king: make us to be In innocence like them, in glory, Thee. Amen. Upon the Epiphany, and the Three Wise Men of the East coming to Worship Jesus. A comet dangling in the aire, Presag'd the ruine both of Death and Sin; And told the wise-men of a King, The King of Glory, and the Sun Of Righteousness, Who then begun To draw towards that blesed Hemisphere. They from the furthest East this new And unknown light pursue, Till they appeare In this blest Infant-King's propitious eye; And pay their homage to His Royalty. Persia might then the rising Sun adore, It was idolatry no more: Great God they gave to Thee, Myrrhe, frankincense, and gold; But Lord, with what shall we Present our selves before Thy majesty, Whom Thou redeem'st when we were sold? W'have nothing but our selves, and scarce that neither, Vile dirt and clay: Yet it is soft, and may Impression take: Accept it, Lord, and say, this Thou had'st rather; Stamp it, and on this sordid metal make Thy holy image, and it shall out-shine The beauty of the golden myne. Amen. A Meditation of the Four last things Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell For the time of Lent especially. A Meditation of Death. Death, the old serpent's son, Thou had'st a sting once like thy sire, That carried Hell, and ever-burning fire: But those black dayes are done; Thy foolish spite buried thy sting In the profound and wide Wound of our Saviour's side. And now thou art become a tame and harmless thing, A thing we dare not fear Since we hear That our triumphant God to punish thee For the affront thou didst Him on the tree, Hath snatcht the keyes of Hell out of thy hand, And made thee stand A porter to the gate of Life, thy mortal enemie. O Thou who art that gate, command that he May when we die And thither flie, Let us into the courts of Heaven through Thee. Allelujah. The Prayer. My soul doth pant tow'rds Thee My God, source of eternal life: Flesh fights with me; Oh end the strife And part us, that in peace I may Unclay My wearied spirit, and take My flight to Thy eternal spring; Where for His sake Who is my King, I may wash all my tears away That day. Thou conqueror of Death, Glorious triumpher o're the grave, Whose holy breath Was spent to save Lost mankinde; make me to be stil'd, Thy child, And take me when I dye And go unto the dust; my soul Above the sky With saints enroll, That in Thy arms for ever I May lie. Amen. Of the Day of Judgement. Great Judge of all, how we vile wretches quake! Our guilty bones do ake, Our marrow freezes, when we think Of the consuming fire Of Thine ire; And horrid phials thou shalt make The wicked drink, When Thou the wine press of Thy wrath shalt tread With feet of lead. Sinfull rebellious clay! what unknown place Shall hide it from Thy face! When Earth shall vanish from Thy sight, The heavens that never err'd, But observ'd Thy laws, shal from Thy presence take their flight, And kil'd with glory, their bright eyes, stark dead Start from their head: Lord, how shall we Thy enemies, endure to see So bright, so killing majesty? Mercy dear Saviour: Thy judgement-seat We dare not, Lord, intreat; We are condemn'd already, there. Mercy: vouchsafe one look On Thy book Of life; Lord we can read the saving Jesus, here, And in His name our own salvation see: Lord set us free: The book of sin Is cross'd within, Our debts are paid by Thee. Mercy! Of Heaven. O beauteous God, uncircumscribèd treasure Of an eternal pleasure, Thy throne is seated far Above the highest star, Where Thou prepar'st a glorious place Within the brightness of Thy face For every spirit To inherit That builds his hopes on Thy merit, And loves Thee with a holy charity. What ravish't heart, seraphick tongue or eyes, Clear as the Morning's rise, Can speak, or think, or see That bright eternity? Where the great King's transparent throne, Is of an intire jaspar stone: There the eye O'th'chrysolite, And a sky Of diamonds, rubies, chrysoprase, And above all, Thy holy face Makes an eternal clarity, When Thou thy jewels up dost binde; that day Remember us, we pray. That where the beryl lies And the crystal, 'bove the skyes, There thou may'st appoint us place Within the brightness of Thy face; And our soul In the scrowl Of life and blissfulness enrowl, That we may praise Thee to eternity. Allelujah. Of Hell. Horrid darkness, sad and sore, And an eternal night, Groanes and shrieks, and thousands more In the want of glorious light: Every corner hath a snake In the accursèd lake: Seas of fire, beds of snow Are the best delights below, A viper from the fire Is his hire That knows not moments from eternity. Glorious God of day and night, Spring of eternall light, Allelujahs, hymns and psalms And coronets of palms Fill Thy temple evermore. O mighty God Let not thy bruising rod Crush our loins with an eternal pressure; O let Thy mercy be the measure, For if Thou keepest wrath in store We all shall die, And none be left to glorifie Thy name, and tell How Thou hast sav'd our souls from Hell. Mercy. On the Conversion of St. Paul. Full of wrath, his threatning breath Belching nought, but chains and death: Saul was arrested in his way By a voice and a light, That if a thousand dayes Should joyn rayes To beautifie one day, It would not show so glorious and so bright. On his amazèd eyes it night did fling, That day might break within: And by those beams of faith Make him of a childe of wrath Become a vessel full of glory. Lord, curb us in our dark and sinful way, We humbly pray, When we down horrid precipices run With feet that thirst to be undone, That this may be our story. Allelujah. On the Purification of the blessed Virgin. Pure and spotless was the maid That to the Temple came, A pair of turtle-doves she paid, Although she brought the Lamb. Pure and spotless though she were, Her body chaste, and her soul faire, She to the Temple went To be purifi'd And try'd, That she was spotless and obedient; O make us follow so blest precedent, And purifie our souls, for we Are cloth'd with sin and misery. From our conception One imperfection, And a continued state of sin, Hath sullied all our faculties within. We present our souls to Thee Full of need and misery: And for redemption a Lamb The purest, whitest that e're came A sacrifice to Thee, Even He that bled upon the Tree. On Good-Friday. The Lamb is eaten, and is yet again Preparing to be slain; The cup is full and mixt, And must be drunk: Wormwood and gall To this, are draughts to beguile care withall, Yet the decree is fixt. Doubled knees, and groans, and cries, Prayers and sighs, and flowing eyes Could not intreat His sad soul, sunk Under the heavy preasure of our sin: The pains of Death and Hell About Him dwell. His Father's burning wrath did make His very heart, like melting wax, to sweat Rivers of blood, Through the pure strainer of his skin, His boiling body stood Bubling all o're As if the wretched whole were but one dore To let in pain and grief, And turn out all relief. O Thou, Who for our sake Dids't drink up This bitter cup: Remember us, we pray, In Thy day, When down The strugling throats of wicked men The dregs of Thy just fury shall be thrown. Oh then Let Thy unbounded mercy think On us, for whom Thou underwent'st this heavy doom, And give us of the well of life to drink. Amen. On the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin. A wingèd harbinger from bright heav'n flown Bespeaks a lodging-room For the mighty King of Love. The spotless structure of a virgin womb, O'reshadow'd with the wings of the blest Dove: For He was travelling to Earth, But did desire to lay By the way That He might shift his clothes, and be A perfect Man as well as we. How good a God have we! Who for our sake, To save us from the burning lake, Did change the order of creation: At first He made Man like Himself in His own Image; now In the more blessed reparation The heavens bow: Eternity took the measure of a span, And said Let us make our self like Man, And not from man the woman take But from the woman, Man. Allelujah: we adore His name, whose goodness hath no store. Allelujah. Easter Day. What glorious light! How bright a sun after so sad a night Does now begin to dawn! Bless'd were those eyes That did behold This sun when He did first unfold His glorious beams, and now begin to rise: It was the holy tender sex That saw the first ray: Saint Peter and the other, had the reflex, The second glimpse o'th'day. Innocence had the first, and he That fled, and then did penance, next did see The glorious Sun of Righteousness In His new dress Of triumph, immortality, and bliss. O dearest God, preserve our souls In holy innocence; Or if we do amiss Make us to rise again to th'life of grace That we may live with Thee, and see Thy glorious face, The crown of holy penitence. Allelujah. On the day of Ascension. He is risen higher, not set: Indeed a cloud Did with His leave make bold to shroud The Sun of Glory, from Mount Olivet. At Pentecost He'll shew Himself again, When every ray shall be a tongue To speak all comforts, and inspire Our souls with their celestial fire; That we the saints among May sing, and love, and reign. Amen. On the Feast of Pentecost, or Whitsunday. Tongues of fire from heaven descend, With a mighty rushing wind To blow it up, and make A living fire Of heavenly charity, and pure desire, Where they their residence should take: On the Apostles sacred heads they sit, Who now like beacons do proclaim and tell Th'invasion of the host of Hell; And give men warning to defend Themselves from the inragèd brunt of it. Lord, let the flames of holy charity, And all her gifts and graces slide Into our hearts, and there abide; That thus refinèd, we may soar above With it unto the element of love, Even unto Thee, dear Spirit, And there eternal peace and rest inherit. Amen. Penitentiall Hymns. I. [Lord, I have sinn'd, and the black number swells] Lord, I have sinn'd, and the black number swells To such a dismal sum, That should my stony heart and eyes, And this whole sinful trunk a flood become, And run to tears, their drops could not suffice To count my score, Much less to pay: But Thou, my God, hast blood in store, And art the patron of the poore. Yet since the balsam of Thy blood, Although it can, will do no good, Unless the wounds be cleans'd with tears before; Thou in Whose sweet but pensive face Laughter could never steal a place, Teach but my heart and eyes To melt away, And then one drop of balsam will suffice. Amen. II. [Great God, and just! how canst Thou see] Great God, and just! how canst Thou see, Dear God, our miserie, And not in mercy set us free? Poor miserable man! how wert thou born, Week as the dewy jewels of the morn, Rapt up in tender dust, Guarded with sins and lust, Who like Court-flatterers waite To serve themselves in thy unhappy fate. Wealth is a snare, and poverty brings in Inlets of theft, paving the way for sin: Each perfum'd vanity doth gently breath Sin in thy Soul, and whispers it to Death. Our faults like ulcerated sores do go O're the sound flesh, and do corrupt that too: Lord, we are sick, spotted with sin: Thick as a crusty leaper's skin; Like Naaman, bid us wash, yet let it be In streams of blood that flow from Thee: Then will we sing. Touch'd by the heavenly Dove's bright wing, Hallelujahs, psalms and praise To God the Lord of night and dayes; Ever good, and ever just, Ever high, Who ever must Thus be sung; is still the same; Eternal praises crown His name. Amen. A prayer for Charity. Full of mercy, full of love, Look upon us from above; Thou who taught'st the blinde man's night To entertain a double light. Thine and the dayes—and that Thine too— The lame away his crutches threw, The parchèd crust of Leprosie Return'd unto its infancy: The dumb amazèd was to hear His own unchain'd tongue strike his ear; Thy powerful mercy did even chase The devil from his usurp'd place, Where Thou Thy self shouldst dwell, not he, O let Thy love our pattern be; Let Thy mercy teach one brother To forgive and love another, That copying Thy mercy here, Thy goodness may hereafter reare Our souls unto Thy glory, when Our dust shall cease to be with men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Job's Curse. [Let the night perish, cursèd be the morn] Let the night perish, cursèd be the morn Wherein 'twas said there is a man-child born! Let not the Lord regard that day, but shroud It's fatal glory in some sullen cloud. May the dark shades of an eternal night Exclude the least kind beam of dawning light; Let unknown babes as in the womb they lye, If it be mention'd, give a groan and dye. No sounds of joy therein shall charm the ear, No sun, no moon, no twilight star appear, But a thick vale of gloomy darkness wear. Why did I not, when first my mother's womb Discharg'd me thence, drop down into my tomb? Then had I been as quiet: and mine eyes Had slept and seen no sorrow; there the wise And subtil councillor, the potentate, Who for themselves built palaces of state, Lie hush't in silence; there's no midnight cry Caus'd by oppressive tyranny Of wicked rulers; there the weary cease From labour, there the prisoner sleeps in peace, The rich, the poor, the monarch, and the slave, Rest undisturb'd, and no distinction have Within the silent chambers of the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Verse-portraits of the Four Evangelists; FROM THE “GREAT EXEMPLAR” (1657). 1 St. Matthew. This Mathew and that angel doth implie Christe's roial ligne in His humanitie: Mankinde Himself, deriving downe the same To Joseph's tribe, from faithfull Abraham. 2 St. Marke. Marke's lion—as his gospell—doth beginne A crier's voice the wilderness within, Make straight His pathes: the same is onely Hee Of Judah's tribe who was foretold to bee. 3. St. Luke. This holy artist with inspirèd pen The great Messiah pourtrayes, and to men Whose sin ore-loaded soules to death encline Att once becomes physician and devine. 4. St. John. Looke how the quick-sight eagle mounts on high Beholds the sunne with her all-piercing eie: So unto Christe's diuinitie I soare Beyond the straine of these that are before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Aurea Grana. Verse Translations. I. From “Deus Justificatus or a Vindication of the Glory of the Divine Attributes in the Question of Original Sin: in a Letter to a Person of Quality.” 1656 (12?) and 1657 (folio). 1. THE FALL. Man was the worke of God, fram'd by His hands; Him did the Serpent cheat, that to death's bands He was subjected for his sin: for this was all: He tasted good and evill by his Fall. [Sic apud Lactant. ii. 13: fol. Cæsenæ, 1646. Aliter in edd-recent.] 2. GUILT AND DESTINY. No guilt upon Mankinde can lie For what's the fault of Destiny. [Seneca Œdip, line 1019.] 3. ORIGINAL SIN. Nor did it please our God, when that our state Was chang'd, to adde a crime unto our fate. [‘Hoc placet’, &amp;c.—Lucan vii., 58.] 4. NO MASTERS: ONE MASTER. If Aristotle be deceiv'd, and say that's true What nor himself nor others ever knew, I leave his text, and let his schollers talke Till they be hoarse or weary in their walke: When wise men erre, though their fame ring like bells, I scape a danger when I leave their spells. [In Poemate cui nomen ‘Zodiacus vitæ’, lib. viii. sive ‘scorpio’, p. 187.—Basil 1563. 8vo.—] 5. THE SOFT ANSWER. Some weaknesse to each man by birth descends, To me too great a kindnesse Nature lends. [Propertius: lib. ii. el. 22.17.] 6. HINDRANCES. He that will sow his field with hopefull seed, Must every bramble, every thistle weed; And when each hindrance to the graine is gone, A fruitfull crop shall rise of corn alone. [al. ‘liberat,’ ‘resecat.’ Boethius, lib. iii. metr. 1.] 7. CONSCIENCE. He that is guilty of a sin Shal rue the crime that he lies in. [Lege ‘Exemplo. . . . . . malo’ Juvenal, Sat. xiii. I.] 8. TRUE IF NEW. Fear not to own what's said because 'tis new; Weigh well and wisely if the thing be true. Truth and not conquest is the best reward; 'Gainst falsehood onely stand upon thy guard. [Lib. ii. lines 1039 et seqq.] II. From “A Discourse of the Nature, Offices, and Measures of Friendship” 1657 and 1673 (folio) and 1678 (12o.) 9. FRIENDSHIPS. Where Vertue dwells there friendships make, But evil neighbourhoods forsake. [Pythag. carm. aur. 5: Theogn. lin. 113.] 10. LOVE FOR LOVE. They lov'd each other with a love That did in all things equal prove. The world was under Saturn's reign When he that lov'd was lov'd again. [Idyll xii. 15.] 11. MUTUAL FRIENDS. Let God give friends to me for my reward, Who shall my love with equal love regard; Happy are they, who when they give their heart Find such as in exchange their own impart. [Theogn. line 337: Bion, ap. Stob. floril, tit. lxiii. (de Venere, &amp;c.) 28.] 12. A FRIEND NOT MONEY. When Fortune frowns upon a man, A friend does more than money can. [Auct. incert. ap. Grot. excerpt. ex trag. et com. p. 945. Paris 1626. 4o.] 13. A NOBLE FRIENDSHIP. By wine and mirth and every daye's delight We choose our friends to whom we think we might Our souls intrust; but fools are they that lend Their bosome to the shadow of a friend. [Line 3rd ????? . . ?????, edd. recentt: ap. Plutarch de frat. am. t vii. p. 872.] 14. UNSELFISHNESS IN FRIENDSHIP. Lands, gold, and trifles many give or lend: But he that stoops in fame is a rare friend; In friendship's orbe thou art the brightest starre, Before thy fame mine thou preferrest far. [Martial, lib. viii, ep. 18: Ibid, lin. 3.] 15. BROTHERS. It is not often you shall see Two brothers live in amity. [Ovid, Met. i., 145.] 16. FRIENDSHIP IMMORTAL. To me though distant let thy friendship fly; Though men be mortal, friendships must not die; Of all things else ther's great satiety. [Theogn lin. 595.] 17. HELP IN ADVERSITY. Friends are to friends as lesser gods, while they Honour and service to each other pay: But when a dark cloud comes, grudge not to lend Thy head, thy heart, thy fortune to thy friend. [Poet incert.—Grot. excerpt. p. 945.] The End.</field>
