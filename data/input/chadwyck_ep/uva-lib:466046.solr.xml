      <field name="fulltext">DIPLOMACY. One day Augustus Richard had A pain that seemed extremely bad, Although it made a very slight Effect upon his appetite. His father recommended Dick To fetch that new Arithmetic And drive the trouble from his chest With sums in Compound Interest. At this the mother, screaming, dropped The milk, and on the carpet flopped, And did not stir till Mr. Peck Had pushed the breadknife down her neck. When she was better, she declared She wondered how her husband dared To scoff at her defenceless young For being born so highly-strung! She said a lot about her rights, And rolled her eyes, to show the whites, And asked the ceiling if a man Had equalled Peck since time began. Reviewing all his faults, at last She fixed on him a lurid past, Till Mr. Peck deplored the day Her father gave his girl away. A doctor came, who quickly guessed What words would suit the mother best Before he diagnosed the wreck Of poor Augustus Richard Peck. He felt his pulse, he tapped his chest, Advised a double-woven vest, And murmured (when he saw his tongue), âMadam, this boy is highly-strung.â âThe symptoms clearly indicate Potentialities. To date There's nothing that, with common care, Won't yield in time to change of air.â âNot English, Doctor, I infer?â The doctor read the truth in her, And said, professionally bland, âA month or two in Switzerland.â When Mr. Peck was told the news He pelted Boz with both his shoes: As neither hit the supple cat He got small pleasure out of that. âI've lived to see,â cried Mrs. Peck, âMy boy less thought of than a cheque! Pray squander on a second wife The value of your offspring's life!â She next assumed a tragic stare And pulled some hairpins from her hair (Dramatic thoroughness!) before She fainted neatly on the floor. When feathers can't be burnt, there's still Much merit in a single quill, If loudly used: so Mr. Peck Revived her with a handsome cheque. When safe upstairs, she laughed amain To think her spouse was tricked again: âIt's lucky that my Better Half Is no more brainy than a calf!â Yet, on his oriental rug, A man bent down, as if to hug His knees, in evident delight At something he had managed right. âI beg you, Bozzy, to excuse My tactical display of shoes.â He hugged his knees again, and then He burst out laughing. Such are men! THE GOD APOLLO (UP TO DATE). Apollo of old was well content Slowly to wander over the hill, Sometimes touching his instrument, Sometimes harking the blackbird's bill. The fastest creature he cared to follow Was not so fast as the arrowy swallow That over the daffodils down in the hollow Lovely flew with a will. 'Twas never a stag with the horns like gold Hurried his Godship over the lea; 'Twas never a sinewy boar of the wold That turned him back from the smell of the sea. Suddenly, softer by far than the swallow, Fleeted the nymph he was fain to follow! Loudly there hummed in the heart of Apollo Venus's honey-bee. He found her, panting and starry fair, Caught in a bush by her cloud of hair. He had flung his harp to the winds, and now Was music itself from feet to brow. When out of the brier he wooed the strands Were strings for the harps of his royal hands, The life in the breast of Apollo's plunder Was shocked and shaken by peals of thunder And zigzag flashes of fear and wonder. What if the Nymph and the God to-day Were back again at the ancient play, On English roads in an English May? Alert and fair on a cushioned seat, With twenty horses under her feet, As soon as the god swung round the bend A sign to the soul of the car she'd send! Like arrows of green the hedges would fly, The mountains seem to fall from the sky; The fence of the park would crackle with sound, And up in the air from the startled ground The pebbles would leap in the sun, and beam Like trout for an instant above the stream. Faster, Girl! for the god is gaining, Thirty horses beneath him straining, Energy out of the monster raining! Apollo would thunder along the curve, With here and there a glorious swerve, As cattle and carts were barely missed (Faster, Girl! if you'd not be kissed!) Or lovers thinking of troth and tryst. Now, were the road or clean or dirty, Now would he cry to his panting thirty, And feed on space; and feel like a world Out of the Shop of Creation hurled To rush superbly among the stars, One in a billion Motor Cars! But long ago he was well content Idly to wander over the hill, Marrying dreams to his instrument, Keenly harking the nightingale's bill. The swiftest creature he cared to follow Was not so swift as the arrowy swallow That over Narcissus asleep in the hollow Flew with a lovely will. THE CONTRAST. In the startling days of Nero, Ere the Muse went down to zero, Then the poet was a hero With a fillet round his head; And the lovely girls were running To his roses and his funning For to listen to the cunning Of the mazy words he said. Then he chose a radiant bearer Of perfections as a sharer Of his joy, and swore none fairer Ever kissed a demi-god; And he quaffed a fauny beaker To the gay and dimpled speaker When she said no skiey seeker Could attract her by his nod. So, forgetting tricks and treason, There he laughed and sang in season With a notable unreason, Such as made him doubly dear, Till the nightfall found him soaking In the country grape, and poking Clever wit at rhymers joking With the candid Beauties near. Of a sudden, slaves would flutter At their meal of bread and butter, And in several lingoes utter Their astonishment to learn How a courtier, rather flurried, From the palace-yard had scurried And incontinently hurried To the poet with an urn. It was gold! and it was jingling With a tune that brought a tingling To the poet's backbone, mingling Pleasant hopes of wealth and bliss, As he thought what he would tender To his colleague sweet and slender Of the honey-hearted gender, Who inspired him with a kiss. If it chances that a poet Reads this poem, he will throw it On the burning coals, or stow it In the basket by his side, Out of agony supernal To remember how infernal Is the change from Rome Eternal To his London on the Tide. Poised between a tear and titter, If he need his pint of Bitter He must fetch his harp and twitter Till he raise the ghost of Joy; For the Singer (more's the pity!) Now must offer in the City To a potentate his ditty To obtain a saveloy. While this noisy age is hounding Art to suicide, and sounding With a clamour too confounding For his educated lyre, He is gnawed by apprehension, Lest he fail to bear the tension Till a niggard Old Age Pension Shall reward him for his fire. Yet he knows an hour undaunted When his bosom, lyric-haunted, Thrills again to what was vaunted Years ago to happier skies; And he quivers at the blowing Of the wind that still is going By a compass past our knowing To the headlands of Surmise. In the startling days of Nero, Ere the Muse went down to zero, Then the poet was a hero With a fillet round his head; But to-day the kings, forgetting All Apollo's brood, are letting Off their popguns, or coquetting With mad-hattery instead! LINES WRITTEN ON BEING ASKED BY CORDELIA, AGED SIXTEEN, TO MAKE A POEM FOR HER JOURNAL. Cordelia does not ask of me That I should bind my hair; Nor does she bid me mind my wheelâ It's punctured, but I don't much care;â She does no more than bid me clear My throat and sing for her to hear. But, Fragrant Child, my singing days Are nearly over, you may guess; No longer do I yearn to praise A girl's capillary excess, Or whisper down her ivory nape A compliment about her shape. No longer do I flaunt the storm With nothing on my rebel locks, As when I hated to be warm, And darkly welcomed holes in socks, And dared the clouds to fill my breast With icicles. They did their best. No longer am I glad to squat, As once, beneath a privet hedge, To wait till beauty from a plot Shall bring a peony as a pledge That, for the moment, I am one She rather likes to dote upon. No longer do I weary June With sentimental hopes and fears; Nor whimper till the nettled Moon Would give her eyes to box my ears; Nor curdle heaven with oaths; nor sign For serfs to bring the henbane wine. In vain for Nancy I assumed A hedgehog's manner, in a space Too small by half, till lovely bloomed That minx's curate-conquering face. I used to reckon it a treat To kiss her insteps, which were neat. One day the heartless Nancy drew, Forgetful of her porcupine, A lean apostle into view And gave him kisses. Eight or nine. It filled me with Beelzebub To see her coddle such a cub! Till then I'd never seemed to care A fig for Disestablishment; But as I bounded on the pair I saw the merit of Dissent. I smote upon that Curate's crown Of stubbly hair. The Church went down. The Church, advancing a pretext He failed with clearness to explain, Appeared to be profoundly vexed; As Abel may have been with Cain, For all we know, before he tired Of being murdered, and expired. Sweet Nancy on the Curate shook The vial of a virgin's care, And patched him up, by hook or crook, To open our Bazaar with prayer. I watched him stroke, at every lull Of words, his corrugated skull. But Nance was lost. I'd thought the girl The Venus of our native shire, And treasured night and day a curl As fair as Vulcan could desire. I judged her Venus then; but now She's fat and placid, like a cow. Yes, Nance was lost. Sweet Nancy Wedge, For whom I'd lurked, in little space, Beneath her father's privet hedge For hours to glimpse her fevering face, Won over by Gregorian Tones, Deserted me and fondled Jones. 'Twas then I wildly flung away, And viewed it as a thing of dread, The curl I'd carried every day, And every night had kissed in bed. I dashed it down. A building bird Was glad to find me so absurd. Small wonder, then, that if I take My jangled lyre from off the pegs E'en Echo's self begins to quake And wish the gods had given her legs. Beneath that hedge my Muse, being damp, First suffered from her present cramp. No longer will I spend my days In dreams of girlhood's loveliness; Nor rack the lexicon to praise In terms original a tress, A pair of eyes of Cambridge blue, A glittering toe-cap on a shoe. Let others tell in verse the piece Of petticoat that Julia shows, And how a lovely line of Greece Is still recorded by her nose, And how the dimple in her cheek Can almost make a dumb man speak. Frivolities! The fuschia wears The petticoat enthralling me. Frivolities! The lily bears The neck I most desire to see. If Cleopatra dropped her glove Invitingly, I would not love! Ginevra's plan is far the best For those afraid of bosom-shocks: The heart she carried in a chest She put inside a second box. When seekers came to where she hid, 'Tis said she never moved a lid. And yet, my Darling, there is much To keep me from a binding vow; Especially as Time may touch To buxom Then your scraggy Now, And put ambrosia where to-day I kiss the chocolate smudge away. Already with delight I view Your charms impacking from the bud: Familiar, yet intensely new! Alert, but wanting wilder blood! . . . . . 'Twere best, since Fortune may be foul, To take, as chimneys do, the cowl. STOLEN KISSES. Closes now the daylight's share; Roses watch celestial lamps Glowing through the scented air, Showing starry camps. All is stilly, though afar Fall the stanzas of a bird Singing underneath his star Ringing word on word. Sweetly cuddle wearied chicks Neatly in the blackbird's nest, Where the farmer's cosy ricks Dare the watery west. Hark! I hear the lovely call Dark were sad indeed to miss: Dairy done, along the wall Mary creeps to kiss. Bird of die-away delights, Heard you ever such a note Tell how Love's delicious plights Swell the amorous throat? Sighs are sweetened when at length Flies her message to the breast Shaking with a fiery strength, Aching with unrest. Nearer comes my flower of eve, Dearer than the fragrant south: Earth and heaven again receive Birth upon her mouth! COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE. 'Twas coming of stars, but a bachelor thrush Was swelling his throat with a musical rush Of frolic and fancy In honour of Nancy, A feather-fine darling unable to blush. Deliciously troubled by sweet pit-a-pat, The heart of the virgin was moved where she sat To yield to a passion Conveyed in the fashion Of sharps, with a pause for a die-away flat. The honeymoon over, the lovers apace Thought less of themselves, and considered the race. They searched for a prickly Position, and quickly Established a circular home in the place. One evening the Moon, who was quite in the vein To chat with the husband, applauded his strain As golden and glowing; And charmingly throwing A kiss with her hand, begged to hear it again. âBecause we shall have a young family soon, My heart is as light as a penny ballon. To guess at my breastful Of joy in the nestful, Imagine yourself with a chick of a moon!â The maidenly Moon, far too flurried to speak, Went sidling away with a blush on her cheek, And left the gay fellow To utter the mellow Endearments that flowed from his positive beak. No wonder he warbled in alto, alive With fancy as sweet as the comb in a hive! If naught of distressing Should wither his blessing, To-morrow would see him a father of five.</field>
