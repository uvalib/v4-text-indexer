      <field name="fulltext">MEDIÃVAL CAROLS The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct metrical lines. 1. Lullay: I saw Lullay lullow Lullay lullow lully lullay bewy bewy lully bewy lully lullow lullay lullow baw baw my barnÃ«, sleep softly now. I saw a sweetÃ«, seemly sight, a blissful burd, a blossom bright, that mourning made and mirth of mang. A maiden mother, meek and mild, in cradle keep a knavÃ« child, that softly sleep; she sat and sang. 2. Hail, Mary, full of grace Hail, Mary, full of grace, Mother in virginity. [1] The holy Ghost is to thee sent From the Father omnipotent; Now is God within thee went, When the angel said Ave. 2 When the angel Ave began, Flesh and blood together ran; Mary bore both God and man Through virtue and through dignity. 3 So saith the gospel of Saint John: God and man is made but one, In flesh and blood, body and bone, One God in personÃ«s three. 4 And the prophet Jeremy Told in his prophecy That the Son of Mary Should die for us on roodÃ«-tree. 5 MuchÃ« joy to us was grant And in earthÃ« peace y-plant, When that born was this 'fant In the land of Galilee. 6 Mary, grant us the bliss, There thy SonnÃ«s woning is; Of that we han done amiss Pray for us pour charitÃ©. Amen. 3. Nowell, nowell: In Bethlem Nowell, nowell, nowell! To us is born our God, Emmanuel. [1] In Bethlem this bird of life Is born of Mary, maiden and wife; He is both God and man, I shrife: Nowell, nowell: This Prince of peace shall ceasen all strife And wone with us perpetual. 2 This child shall buy us with his blood And be nailÃ«d upon the rood; His ransom passeth all earthly good; Nowell, nowell! Alas, what wight dare be so wode To slay so gentle a jewel? 3 By his powst he his emprise Shall take fro hell at his up-rise And save mankind upon this wise; Nowell, nowell! Thus tell'th us the prophecies, That he is King of heaven and hell. 4 This maiden's Son to his empere Shall stey to heaven by his power; His Holy Ghost us all shall lere; Nowell, nowell! They and the Father in fere Shall reign one God, this 'lieve I well. 5 Pray we this child with good intent In our dying he us present Unto his Father omnipotent; Nowell, nowell! The first tiding of this testament Brought to us Saint Gabriel. 5. Now may we singen Now may we singen as it is, Quod puer natus est nobis. [1] This babe to us that now is bore, Wonderful workÃ«s he hath y-wrought; He will not lese that was y-lore, But boldely again it bought. And thus it is, forsooth y-wis, He asketh nought but that is his. 2 This chaffar loved he right well: The price was high and bought full dear; Who would suffer and for us feel As did that Prince withouten peer? And thus it is.... 3 His ransom for us hath y-paid; Of reason then we own to been his; Be mercy asked, and he be prayed, We may by right challengÃ« bliss. And thus it is.... 4 To some purpose God madÃ« man: I 'lieve well to salvation; What was his blood that fro him ran But defence against dampnation? And thus it is.... 5 Almighty God in Trinity, Thy mercy we pray with whole heart: Thy mercy may all woe make flee, And dangerous dread fro us do start And thus it is.... 6. Be merry, be merry Be merry, be merry, I pray you evrychon. [1] A princ'pal point of charity It is, merry to be in him That is but one; be merry 2 For he that is but one in bliss To us hath sent his son y-wis To save us from our foon;... 3 For of a maiden a child was born To save mankind that was forlorn; Man, think thereon;... 4 Now, Mary, for thy SonnÃ«s sake Save them allÃ« that mirthÃ« make And longest holdy on;... 7. Nowell sing we Nowell sing we now all and some, For rex pacificus is come. [1] In Bethlem in that fair city, A child was born of a maiden free, That shall a lord and princÃ« be, A solis ortus cardine. 2 Children were slain full great plenty, Jesu, for the love of thee; Wherefore their soulÃ«s savÃ«d be, Hostis Herodis impie. 3 As sunnÃ« shineth through the glass, So Jesu in his mother was; Thee to servÃ« now grant us grace, O lux beata Trinitas. 4 Now God is comÃ«n to worshipÃ«n us; Now of Mary is born Jesus; Make we merry amongÃ«s us; Exultet celum laudibus. 9. Now make we mirthÃ« Now make we mirthÃ« all and some, For ChristÃ«massÃ« now is y-come, That hath no peer; sing we all in fere; Now joy and bliss they shall not miss That maketh good cheer. [1] Now God Almighty down hath sent The Holy Ghost to be present, To light in Mary, maiden verament, That bare GoddÃ«s Son with good intent, That hath no etc. 2 Now GoddÃ«s Son omnipotent, In Mary mild he hath hent Flesh and blood, for he hath meant Man to restore again to his rent: That hath no peer.... 3 To mild Mary our heart be bent, That blissful lady so be bent To pray for us we be not shent, To Jesu Christ, her Son so gent: That hath no peer.... 11. What tidings bringest thou? What tidings bringest thou, messenger, Of ChristÃ«s birth this YolÃ«s day? [1] A babe is born of high nature, The Prince of Peace that ever shall be; Of heaven and earth he hath the cure, His lordship is eternity: Such wonder tidings ye may hear, That man is made now GoddÃ«s peer, Whom sin had made but fiendÃ«s prey. 2 A wonder thing is now befall; That king that formÃ«d star and sun, Heaven and earth and angels all, Now in mankind is new begun: Such wonder tidings ye may hear, A 'fant is now of one year, That hath been ever and shall be ay. 3 That seemliest selcouth to see: This burd that hath this babe y-born And lord conceived of high degree, A maiden is as was beforn: Such wonder tidings ye may hear, That maiden and mother is one in fere, And she a lady of great array. 4 That loveliest gan greet her child: Hail Son, hail Brother, hail Father dear! Hail daughter, he saith, Hail mother mild! This hailing was on quaint manner. Such wonder tidings ye may hear, That hailing was of so good cheer That mannÃ«s pain is turned to play. 12. Eya, martyr Stephane Eya, martyr Stephane, Pray for us we pray to thee. [1] Of this martyr make we mend, Qui triumphavit hodie And to heaven bliss gan wend, Dono celestis gracie. 2 StonÃ«d he was with stonÃ«s great Fervore gentis impie; Then he saw Christ sit in seat, Innixum Patris dextere. 3 Thou praydest Christ for thine en'mies, O martyr invictissime; Thou pray for us that high Justice Ut nos purget a crimine. Amen. 13. Pray for us Pray for us the Prince of peace, Amice Christi, Johannes. [1] To thee now, ChristÃ«s dear darling, That were a maiden both eld and ying, Mine heart is set to thee to sing, Amice Christi, Johannes. 2 For thou were so clean a may, The privities of heaven forsooth thou say, When on ChristÃ«s breast thou lay, Amice Christi, Johannes. 3 When Christ beforn Pilate was brought, Thou cleanÃ« maiden forsook him nought; To die with him was all thy thought, Amice Christi, Johannes. 4 ChristÃ«s mother was thee betake, A maiden to be a maidenÃ«s make; Thou be our help we be not forsake, Amice Christi, Johannes. 14. There is no rose There is no rose of such virtue As is the rose that bare Jesu. [1] There is no rose of such virtue As is the rose that bare Jesu; Alleluia. 2 For in this rose containÃ«d was Heaven and earth in little space; Res miranda. 3 By that rose we may well see That he is God in persons three, Pari forma. 4 The angels sungen the shepherds to: Gloria in excelsis Deo: Gaudeamus. 5 Leave we all this worldly mirth, And follow we this joyful birth; Transeamus. 16. Nowell sing we Nowell sing we both all and some; Now Rex pacificus is y-come. [1] Exortum est in love and liss; Now Christ his grace he gan us giss, And with his body us bought to bliss, Both all and some. 2 De fructu ventris of Mary bright; Both God and man in her alight; Out of disease he did us dight, Both all and some. 3 Puer natus to us was sent, To bliss us bought, fro bale us blent, And else to woe we had y-went, Both all and some. 4 Lux fulgebit with love and light, In Mary mild his pennon pight, In her took kind with manly might, Both all and some. 5 Gloria tibi ay and bliss: God unto his grace he us wiss, The rent of heaven that we not miss, Both all and some. 18. Goday, my lord Goday, goday, My lord Sire ChristÃ«mas, goday! [1] Goday, Sire ChristÃ«mas, our king, For ev'ry man, both old and ying, Is glad and blithe of your coming; Goday! 2 GÃ¶ddes Son so much of might From heaven to earthÃ« down is light And born is of a maid so bright; Good day! 3 Heaven and earth and also hell, And all that ever in them dwell, Of your coming they beth full snell; Good day! 4 Of your coming this clerkÃ«s find: Ye come to save all mankind And of their balÃ«s them unbind; Good day! 5 All manner of mirthÃ«s we will make And solace to our heartÃ«s take, My seemly lordÃ«, for your sake; Good day! 19. Of a rose sing we Of a rose singÃ« we, Misterium mirabile. [1] This rose is railed on a rys; She hath brought the Prince of price, And in this timÃ« sooth it is, Viri sine semine. 2 This rose is red of colour bright, Thro whom our joyÃ« gan alight Upon a ChristÃ«smassÃ« night, Claro David germine. 3 Of this rose was Christ y-bore, To save mankind that was forlore, And us allÃ« from sinnÃ«s sore, Prophetarum carmine. 4 This rose, of flowrÃ«s she is flower; She ne will fadÃ« for no shower; To sinful men she sent succour, Mira plenitudine. 5 This rose is so fair of hue; In maid Mary that is so true Y-bornÃ« was Lord of virtue, Salvator sine crimine. 20. Alleluia: Now well may we mirthes make Alleluia. [1] Now well may we mirthÃ«s make: For us Jesus manhoodÃ« hath take Only for our sinnÃ«s sake; Allelulia. 2 A King of Kings now forth is brought Of a maid that sinned nought, Neither in deed, neither in thought, Res miranda. 3 An angel of counsel this day is born Of a maid, I said beforn, For to save that was forlorn; Sol de stella. 4 That sun hath never down-going, Neither his light no timÃ« lesing; The star is evermore shining, Semper clara. 5 Right as the star bring'th forth a beam Of whom there com'th a marvellous stream, So childed the maid withoutÃ« wem; Pari forma. 21. Sing we to this merry company Sing we to this merry company, Regina celi, letare. [1] Holy maidÃ«, blessÃ«d thou be; GoddÃ«s son is born of thee, The Father of heaven, thus lievÃ« we: Regina celi, letare. 2 Thou art empÃ«ress of heaven free; Now art thou mother in majesty, Y-knit in the blessÃ«d Trinity; Regina celi, letare. 3 Hail wife, hail maidÃ«, bright of ble! Hail daughter, hail sister full of pity! Hail cousin to the Persons Three! Regina celi, letare. 4 Lo, this courteous King of degree Will be thy Son with solempnity; Mild Mary, this is thy fee; Regina celi, letare. 5 Therefore kneel we on our knee; Thy blissful birth now worship we With this song of melody: Regina celi, letare. 23. Alma redemptoris mater Alma redemptoris mater. [1] As I lay upon a night, Me thought I saw a seemly sight That called was Mary bright, Redemptoris mater. 2 There came Gabriel with light And said: HailÃ«, thou sweetÃ« wight! To be clepÃ«d thou art y-dight Redemptoris mater. 3 There she conceivÃ«d God Almight, That was in stall with her all night, And there men knewÃ« what she hight, Redemptoris mater. 4 When Jesu was on the rood y-pight, Mary was sorry of that sight Till that she saw him rise upright, Redemptoris mater. 5 And after to heaven he took his flight, There he is now in blissÃ« bright, And with him that sweetÃ« wight, Redemptoris mater. 24. Ave domina Ave domina, celi regina. [1] Worship be the birth of thee, Quem portasti Maria, Both in bower and in city Ave domina. 2 For thro our sins we were forlorn, Infernali pena, But now shall us save that thou hast borne; Ave domina. 3 Almighty GoddÃ«s will it was, Felix fecundata, That upon thee shall light his grace; Ave domina. 4 Y-blessÃ«d be thou, maidÃ« mild, Que semper es amica BetweenÃ« mankind and the Child; Ave domina. 5 Lady, queen of paradise, Mater Dei electa, Thou bare our Lord, that high Justice; Ave domina. 6 With mirth and all solempnity Nato canunt omnia; Thou burd of ble, welcome thou be; Ave domina. 25. Nowell, nowell Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell. [1] Out of your sleep arise and wake, For God mankind now hath y-take, All of a maid without any make; Of all women she bear'th the bell: Nowell. 2 And thro a maidÃ« fair and wise Now man is made of full great prize; Now angels kneelÃ«n to mannÃ«s servise, And at this time all this befell: Nowell! 3 Now man is brighter than the sun; Now man in heaven on high shall wone; BlessÃ«d be God this game is begun; And his mother empress of hell: Nowell! 4 That ever was thrall, now is he free; That ever was small, now great is she; Now shall God deem both thee and me Unto his bliss if we do well: Nowell! 5 Now man may to heaven wend; Now heaven and earth to him they bend; He that was foe now is our friend; This is no nay that I you tell: Nowell! 6 Now, blessed brother, grant us grace A Domesday to see thy face And in thy court to have a place, That we mow therÃ« sing nowell, Nowell! 26. Make we joy Make we joy now in this fest, In quo Christus natus est; Eya. [1] A patre unigenitus Thorow a maiden is come to us; Sing we to her and say: Welcome, Veni, redemptor gencium. 2 Agnoscat omne seculum: A bright star three kings made come For to seek with their presence Verbum supernum prodiens. 3 A solis ortus cardine, So mighty a lord was none as he, For to our kind he hath give gryth, Adam parens quod polluit. 4 Maria ventre concepit; The Holy Ghost was ay her with. In Bethlehem y-born he is, Consors paterni luminis. 5 O lux beata Trinitas! He lay between an ox and ass, Thou mother and maiden free; Gloria tibi, Domine. 27. What tidings bringest thou? What tidings bringest thou, messenger, Of ChristÃ«s birth this yearÃ«s day? [1] A babe is born of high nature, Is Prince of peace and ever shall be; Of heaven and earth he hath the cure, His lordship is eternity; Such wonder tidings ye mow hear; What tidings bringest thou messenger? That man is made now GoddÃ«s fere, Whom sin had made but fiendÃ«s prey. 2 A seemly sight it is to see: The burd that hath this babe y-born ConceivÃ«d a lord of high degree, And maiden as she was beforn. Such wonder tidings ye mow hear: What tidings bringest thou, messenger? That maid and mother is one y-fere And alway lady of high array. 3 This maid began to greeten her child, And said: Hail Son, hail Father dear! He said: Hail mother, hail maidÃ« mild! This greeting was in quaint manner. Such wonder tidings ye mow hear: What tidings bringest thou, messenger? Their greeting was in such manner, It turnÃ«d mannÃ«s pain to play. 4 A wonder thing is now befall: That Lord that formÃ«d star and sun, Heaven and earth and angels all, Now in mankind is begun. Such wonder tidings ye mow hear: What tidings bringest thou, messenger? A 'fant that is not of one year Ever hath y-be and shall be ay. 30. Alleluia: A newÃ« work Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. [1] A newÃ« work is come on hond, Through might and grace of GoddÃ«s sond, To save the lost of every lond, Alleluia, alleluia, For now is free that erst was bond; We mow well sing alleluia. 2 By Gabriel begun it was: Right as the sun shone thro the glass Jesu Christ conceivÃ«d was, Alleluia, alleluia, Of Mary mother, full of grace; Now sing we here alleluia. 3 Now is fulfilled the prophecy Of David and of Jeremy, And also of Isaie, Alleluia, alleluia, Sing we therefore both loud and high: Alleluia, alleluia. 4 Simeon on his armÃ«s right ClippÃ«d Jesu full of might And said unto that barne so bright, Alleluia, alleluia; I see my SavÃ¯our in sight; And sung therewith alleluia. 5 Then he said, withoutÃ« lece: Lord, thou set thy servant in peace, For now I have that I ever chece, Alleluia, alleluia, All ourÃ« joyÃ«s to increase There saintÃ«s singeth alleluia. 6 Alleluia, this sweetÃ« song, Out of a greenÃ« branch it sprong. God send us the life that lasteth long! Alleluia, alleluia, Now joy and bliss be them among That thus can sing alleluia. 32. An heavenly song An heavenly song, I dare well say, Is sung in earth to man this day. [1] This is the song that ye shall hear: God is come from his empere, And is made man with high desire, This day. 2 He took our kind all of a maid; By ox and ass he was y-laid; Now is fulfilled that Scripture said This day. 3 Ay I wonder this in my mind: That he that all may loose and bind Would be laid by beastÃ«s unkind This day. 4 He is a lord, and by nature A maiden's breast he suck full pure; Heaven and earth beth in his cure This day. 33. Hail, GoddÃ«s Son Hail, GoddÃ«s Son in Trinity, The second in divinity, Thy mother is amay. [1] Lo, Moises bush shining unbrent, The flowres fair God there present; Our Lady with child it be meant, As prophets said in their lay. 2 This is GideonÃ«s wool-fell, On whom the dew of heaven did dwell; The dew of heaven on Mary fell When she conceivÃ«d Adonay. 3 AaronÃ«s rod without liquor By marvel bare both fruit and flower; So God and man, our Saviour, A cleanÃ« maid hath borne this day. 4 This JacobÃ«s star with shining leme That Balaam saw in Balak's reme Figureth Mary, that in Bethlem Bare Jesu and laid in hay. 5 But God bewrayed by fair figure His virginal progeniture. Now Mary's Son have us in cure, And grant us bliss that lasteth ay. 36. Ave Maria Ave Maria, Ave Maria, gracia Dei plena Ave Maria, Ave Maria, gracia Dei plena. Hail, blessÃ«d flower of virginity, that bare this time a child so free, that was and is and ever shall be; Ave Mari etc. 39. Laus, honor, virtus, gloria Laus, honor, virtus, gloria Et tibi decus, Maria. [1] A song to sing I have good right, And mirth to make in this presence, For now is born a baron of might, Mundum pugillo continens. 2 This babe was born on YulÃ« night, In Bethlehem of Our Lady; The name of him is callÃ«d right Verbum Patris altissimi. 3 That now is come peace for to make Between the Father of Heaven and us; And nowÃ« for that childÃ«s sake Exultet celum laudibus. 4 Our sin to slay he took the way Into the world fro heaven rich bliss, And therefore both night and day Resultet terra gaudiis. 5 The child felled all the fiendÃ«s pride And with hard irÃ¶n bound him in close, And with the blood of his dear side. Solvit a pena miseros. 6 Now Jesu Christ, that came so still Into the womb of Mary free, We pray thee, if it be thy will, Mane nobiscum, Domine. 41. Veni, Redemptor gencium Veni, Redemptor gencium Veni, Redemptor gencium. [1] This worlÃ« wondreth of all thing How a maid conceived a king; To give us all thereof shewing, Veni, Redemptor gencium. 2 When Gabriel came with his greeting To Mary mother, that sweetÃ« thing, He granted and said with great liking: Veni, Redemptor gencium. 3 AmbrosÃ« said in his writing Christ should be in a maid dwelling, To makÃ« sooth all that singing: Veni, Redemptor gencium. 4 And David said in his spelling That truth should be in earth growing; To us, buyer of allÃ« thing, Veni, Redemptor gencium. 5 Christ, y-crowned at our beginning, Be with us at our ending, Us to thy joyÃ« for to bring; Veni, Redemptor gencium. 42. Abide, I hope it be the best Abide, I hope it be the best. [1] Abide, I hope it be the best, Sith hasty man lacked never woe. 2 Let every man that will have rest Ever ben avised what he will do. 3 Prove ere ye take, think ere ye fest; In weal beware ere ye be woe. 4 Under the bush ye shall tempest Abide, till it be over-go. 5 For long time your heart shall brast; Abide, I counsel you do so. 47. Novo profusi gaudio Novo profusi gaudio, Benedicamus Domino. 1 Omnes gentes, plaudite, Car notre Saviour est nÃ©; Over all blessed he be, Rex alpha et o. 2 A solis ortus cardine, Comme le monde est long et lÃ©, All mankind maketh glee, Angeli canunt Deo. 3 Enixa est puerpera, Que Saint Esprit en engrossa; Blessed be time that she said ya, Gabriele nuncio. 4 Ex illibata virgine Est nascu le Roi de MajestÃ©; The hirds him see in low degree Jacentem in presepio. 5 Gloria tibi, Domine, Fontaine de grÃ¢ce et de pitiÃ©; Of all thy goodness we thank thee; Benedicamus Domino. 48. Novus sol de virgine Novus sol de virgine Reluxit nobis hodie. 1 The holy daughter of Zion, Princess of Jerusalem, This day sprang out of thee alone The grain of Jesse in Bethlem. 2 This day also the bright star That Balaam gan to magnify, He rose of thee to stint our warrÃ« And in darkness us to gy. 3 Thou art also abown ilkon, A mother and a maiden true, And the yard eke of Aaron, That bare this day a burgeon new. 4 The orient light of Nazareth Thou art also, to stint our strife, That broughtÃ« forth againÃ«s death This day the soothfast Man of Life. 5 Thou art eke the fleece of Gideon, A-dewÃ«d with the Holy Ghost; The chaste temple of Solomon, Clear as crystal in every coast. 6 Thou art eke the joy of Israel, To stint all our oldÃ« sorrow; The gatÃ« which Ezechiel Saw alway close both even and morrow. 7 And thou art eke the purple rose That whilom grew in Jericho; The Father's wisdom to enclose Thou were the temple and tower also. 8 Now, thou chaste lily flower, Springing from the JewÃ«s spine, Be our help and our succour AgainÃ«s the venom serpentine. 50. The holy martyr Stephen The holy martyr, Stephen, we pray To be our succour both night and day. 1 I shall you tell this ilkÃ« night Of Saint Stephen, GoddÃ«s knight; He told the JewÃ«s that it was right That Christ was born of amay. 2 Then said the JewÃ«s with great scorn That God Son might not be born; Stephen then sayÃ«d: Ye be forlorn And all that 'lievÃ«n in that lay. 3 Now is sprung the well of life Of Mary, mother, maiden and wife; Therefore the JewÃ«s fell in strife Disputing with Stephen agains his fay. 4 The cursed JewÃ«s at the last StonÃ«s to Stephen they gan cast; They beaten him and bound him fast And made his body in foul array. 5 Into the field they led him tho And then him followed many a foe; They grinnÃ«d on him and did him woe; Them thought they had a noble play. 6 The JewÃ«s that were both stiff and strong, They stonÃ«d him and did wrong, Great stÃ¶nes about him sprong, And sayÃ«d: We thy meed shall pay. 51. Qui natus est de virgine Qui natus est de virgine, Salvum me fac, Domine. 1 Father and Son and Holy Ghost, Great God in Trinity, As thou art Lord of might most, Salvum me etc 2 As thou art wise and right well wost, This world is but a vanity, When I shall die and yield my ghost, Salvum me etc 3 Whe'r I sleep, whe'r I wake, On lond or water where I be, As thou did die for man sake, Salvum me etc 54. Illuminare Jerusalem Illuminare, Jerusalem, The Duke appeareth in Bethlem. 1 His signÃ« is a star bright, That shineth over him with light; It is nought come but of his might: Illuminare, Jerusalem. 2 This day three kings made oblation: He gi'th to water sanctification; By baptism our renovation: Illuminare, Jerusalem. 3 The Holy Ghost o'er him alight, The Father's voice was heard on height: This is my Son, me please him right: Illuminare, Jerusalem. 55. Ivy is good Ivy is good and glad to see, Ivy is fair in his degree. 1 Ivy is both fair and green In winter and in summer also; And it is medecinable I ween, Who knew the virtues that long there-to: Ivy: it is good and lusty And in his kind a well good tree. 2 Ivy hath virtues full good; Namely, spreading over the ground; Whether it be in town or wood, It helpeth the sore and maketh sound: Ivy: in book is found full sikerly That green is gladsome to see. 3 When other trees most del fail, Then beareth Ivy his berries full bold; In great stormÃ«s of snow and hail It sparÃ«s for no weather's cold: Ivy: to bring forth fruit full properly, To beast and bird full great plenty. 4 The fairest bird that flieth by sky, For gladness of that lusty tree, Might make his nest in green Ivy To nourish his birdÃ«s fair and free: Ivy: Therein is covert well privy To comfort him that there will be. 5 Where it taketh hold it keepeth fast And strenketh it that is him by; It keepeth wall from cost and waste, As men may see all day at hye: Ivy: I can tell no cause why But we must love that gentle tree. 60. Enforce we us Enforce we us with all our might To love Saint George our lady knight. 1 Worship of virtue is the meed, And sueth him ay of right; To worship George then have we need, Which is our sov'reign lady's knight. 2 He kept the maid from dragon's dread, And fraÃ¯d all France and put to flight At Agincourt, the chronicle ye read; The French him see formost in fight. 3 In his virtue he will us lead AgainÃ«s the fiend, the foul wight, And with his banner us over spread, If we him love with all our might. 64. Almighty Jesu Almighty Jesu, King of bliss, Assumpsit carnem virginis. He was ever and ever is Consors paterni luminis. 1 Holy Church of him maketh mind: Intravit ventris thalamum, Fro heaven to earth to save mankind Pater mandavit filium. 2 To Mary came a messenger, Ferens salutem hominum, And she answer'd with mild steven: Ecce, ancilla Domini. 3 Thorow the might of the Holy Ghost, Palacium intrans uteri; Above all thing meekness is best In conspectu Altissimi. 4 Three kings upon the twelfth day Stella micante previa, To seek our Lord they took the way Bajulantes munera. 5 A star beforn the kingÃ«s ay; Primus rex aurum optulit; He is God and Lord verray; Secundus rex thus protulit. 6 He was namÃ«d the third king, Incensum pulchrum qui tradidit; He us all to blissÃ« bring, Qui cruce mori voluit. 65. I pray you all I pray you all with one thought, Amendeth me and payre me nought. 1 Holy Writ saith nothing is sother Than no man should apayre other; Sith in God I am thy brother, Amendeth me and payre me nought. 2 The lore in the Gospel ilk man may see: If thy brother trespass to thee, Between us two snib thou me, Amendeth me and payre me nought. 3 If thou see I do amiss, And no man wot but thou of this, Make it nought so ill as it is; Amendeth me and payre me nought. 4 God biddÃ«s thou shalt no man defame, Nor apayre no man's name, But even as thou would have the same, Amend me and payre me nought. 5 Apayre thou no man with thy word, Nother in earnest ne in bord; Let thy tongue that is thy sword Amend ever and payre nought. 6 Now to amend God give us grace Of repentance, and very space In heaven there to see his face, Where we shall mend and payre nought. 66. Ave, plena gracia Ave, plena gracia, Dei mater Maria. 1 Hail be thou, Mary most of honour, Thou bare Jesu our Saviour, Maria; Ave, plena gracia. 2 Hail be thou, maiden, mother and wife, Hail be thou stinter of our strife, Maria; Ave, plena gracia. 3 Hail be thou, queen of paradise, Of all women thou bearÃ«s price, Maria; Ave, plena gracia. 4 Thou pray for us unto thy Son In heaven bliss that we may wone, Maria; Ave, plena gracia. 97. Now make we joy Now makÃ« we joy in this fest, In quo Christus natus est. [1] A Patre unigenitus Through a maiden is come till us; Sing we to him and say: Welcome! Veni, Redemptor gencium. 2 Agnoscat omne seculum, A bright star three kings made come; So mighty a Lord is none as he, A solis ortus cardine 100. I pray you all I pray you all with one thoughtÃ«, AmendÃ« me and payre me nought. [1] Holy Writ saith, which nothing is sother, That no man should apayre other; Sith then in God I am thy brother, AmendÃ« me and payre me nought. 2 This lore in the Gospel each man may see: If I, thy brother, trespass thee, Betwixt us two upneme thou me; AmendÃ« me and payre me nought. 3 If thou see I do greatly amiss And no man wot but thou of this, Make it not yet so evil as it is; AmendÃ« me and payre me nought. 105. Alleluia: Now may we mirthÃ«s make Alleluia. [1] Now may we mirthÃ«s make; For us Jesus manhood hath take, Alleluia, Only for our sinnÃ«s sake, De virgine Maria. 2 The King of KingÃ«s now forth is brought Of a maid that sinned nought, Alleluia, Ne'er in deed, ne'er in thought; Res miranda. 3 The angel of counsel that day was born As the prophecy said beforn, Alleluia, For to save that was forlorn; Sol de stella. 106. Pray for us Pray for us, thou prince of peace, Amice Christi, Johannes. [1] To thee now, ChristÃ«s darling, The which was maiden both old and young, My soul is set to sing: Amice Christi, Johannes. 2 On ChristÃ«s breast asleep he lay; The privities of heaven there he say, For he was so clean a may; Amice Christi, Johannes. 3 Christ before Pilate was brought; The clean maiden forsook him nought; To die with him was all his thought; Amice Christi, Johannes. 4 ChristÃ«s mother was him betake, A maiden to be anotherÃ«s make; Through their help we shall not be forsake; Amice Christi, Johannes. 114. To many a well To many a well have I go To find water to wash me fro woe. [1] I have y-sought in many a side To find water to wash me fro woe; Yet could I nought walk so wide To find water to wash me so. 2 I have heard speak of a well, Thereof springeth streamÃ«s fele; A man that thereof had his fill, Of his woe should come his weal. 3 That well is mercy, I have heard say, And shall be without end; Almighty God, to thee we pray, Give us grace that well to find. 115. Pray for us Pray for us, thou prince of peace, Amice Christi, Johannes. [1] To thee now, ChristÃ«s own darling, The which were a maid both old and young, My soul is set a song to sing, Amice Christi, Johannes. 2 ChristÃ«s mother was him betake, A maiden to be another's make; Be they our help that we be not forsake. Amice Christi, Johannes.</field>
