      <field name="fulltext">FIELD-SPORTS. A POEM. Once more, Great Prince, permit an humble Bard Prostrate to pay his Homage at your Feet; Then, like the morning lark from the low ground Tow'ring aloft, sublime to soar, and sing; Sing the heart-chearing pleasure of the fields, The choice delight of heroes and of kings. In earlier times, monarchs of eastern race In their full blaze of pride, as story tells, Train'd up th' imperial Eagle, sacred bird! Hooded, with gingling bells, she perch'd on high; Not as when erst Standard of the Roman Legions. on golden wings she led The Roman legions o'er the conquer'd globe, Mankind her quarry; but a docile slave, Tam'd to the lure, and careful to attend Her master's voice. Behold the man renown'd, A famous King of Persia. Abbas the Great (whom all his fawning slaves Deem'd King of Kings; vain fools! They sure forgot Greater Leonidas, and those fatal Straits of Thermopylæ. See the Story of Xerxes. straits Blood-stain'd, where slaughter'd Persians fell on heaps, A dreadful carnage!) See his num'rous host Spread wide the plains, and in their front upborne Each on her perch, that bends beneath her weight, Two sister Eagles, stately, pond'rous birds! The air's a desert, and the feather'd race Fly to the neighb'ring coverts dark retreats. The royal pair on wing, This whirls around In circles wide, or like the swallow skims The russet plain, and mimics, as she flies, (By many a sleepless night instructed well) The Hound's loud op'nings, or the Spaniel's quest. What cannot wakeful industry subdue! Meanwhile that mounts on high, and seems to view A black ascending cloud; when pierc'd the gloom Of vapours dank condens'd, the sun's bright beams Pain not her sight: She with expanded sails Works through th' etherial fluid: then perhaps Sees through a break of clouds this self-pois'd orb, Hard by her hand-maid moon. She looks beneath Contemptuous, and beholds from far this Earth, This mole-hill Earth, and all its busy ants Lab'ring for life, which lasts so short a day Just blazing and extinct. So Thou, my Soul, That breath of life, (which all men must perceive But none distinctly know) when once escap'd From this poor helpless corse, and when on high Borne on angelic wings, look down with scorn On this mean less'ning world, and knaves grown rich, By chance, or fraud, or insolence of pow'r. Now from her highest pitch, by quick degrees, With less ambition nearer earth she tends, As yet scarce visible; and high in air Pois'd on extended wings, with sharper ken Attentive marks whate'er is done below. Thus some wise Gen'ral from a rising ground Observes th' embattled foe, where serried ranks Forbid access, or where their order loose Invites th' attack, and points the way to fate. All now is tumult, each heart swells with joy, The falc'ners shout, and the wide concave rings, Tremble the forests round, the joyous cries Float thro' the vales, and rocks, and woods, and hills Return the varied sounds. Forth bursts the Stag, Nor trusts the mazes of his deep recess: Fear hid him close, strange inconsistent guide! Now hurries him aghast with busy feet Far o'er the spacious plain; he pants to reach The mountain's brow, or with unsteddy step To climb the craggy cliff: The Grey-hounds strain Behind to pinch his haunch, who scarce evades Their gaping jaws. One Eagle wheeling flies In airy lab'rinths, or with easier wing Skims by his side, and stuns his patient ear With hideous cries, then peals his forehead broad, Or, at his eyes her fatal malice aims. The Other, like the bolt of angry heav'n, Darts down at once, and fixes on his back Her griping talons, ploughing with her beak His pamper'd chine: The blood, and sweat distill'd From many a dripping furrow stains the soil. Who pities not this fury-haunted wretch Embarrass'd thus, on ev'ry side distress'd? Death will relieve him, for the Grey-hounds fierce, Seizing their prey, soon drag him to the ground, Groaning he falls; with eyes that swim in tears He looks on man, chief author of his woe, And weeps, and dies. The Grandees press around To dip their sabres in his boiling blood; Unseemly joy! 'Tis barb'rous to insult A fallen foe. The Dogs, and Birds of Prey Insatiate, on his reeking bowels feast, But the stern Falc'ner claims the lion's share. Such are the Sports of Kings, and better far Than royal robb'ry, and the bloody jaws Of all-devouring war. Each Animal, By nat'rl instinct taught, spares his own kind: But Man, the Tyrant Man, revels at large, Free-booter unrestrain'd, destroys at will The whole creation, Men and Beasts his prey, These for his Pleasure, for his Glory Those. Next will I sing the valiant Falcon's fame, Aerial fights, where no confed'rate brute Joins in the bloody fray; but bird with bird Justs in mid-air. Lo! at his The Place where the Hern takes his Stand, watching his Prey. Siege the Hern Upon the bank of some small purling Brook, Observant stands to take his scaly prize, Himself another's Game. For mark behind The wily Falc'ner creeps, his grazing Horse Conceals the treach'rous foe, and on his fist Th' unhooded Falcon sits: With eager eyes She meditates her prey, and in her wild Conceit, already plumes the dying bird. Up springs the Hern, redoubling ev'ry stroke, Conscious of danger stretches far away, With busy pennons, and projected beak, Piercing th' opponent clouds: The Falcon swift Follows at speed, mounts as he mounts, for Hope Gives vigour to her wings. Another soon Strains after to support the bold attack, Perhaps a Third. As in some winding creek, On proud Iberia's shore, the corsairs sly Lurk waiting to surprize a British sail, Full-freighted from Legborn, &amp;c. Hetruria's friendly ports, Or rich Constantinople. Byzantium; after her they skud Dashing the spumy waves with equal oars, And spreading all their shrouds: She makes the Main Inviting ev'ry gale, nor yet forgets To clear her Deck, and tell th' insulting foe In peals of Thunder, Britons cannot fear, So flies the Hern pursued, but fighting flies. Warm grows the Conflict, ev'ry Nerve's imploy'd; Now through the yielding element they soar Aspiring high, then sink at once, and rove In trackless mazes through the troubled sky. No rest, no peace. The Falcon hov'ring flies Balanc'd in air, and confidently bold Hangs o'er him like a cloud, then aims her blow Full at his destin'd head. The watchful Hern Shoots from her like a blazing meteor swift That gilds the night, eludes her talons keen, And pointed beak, and gains a length of way. Observe th' attentive croud, all hearts are fix'd On this important war, and pleasing hope Glows in each Breast. The Vulgar and the Great, Equally happy now, with freedom share The common joy. The Shepherd-Boy forgets His bleating care; the lab'ring Hind lets fall His Grain unsown, in transport lost he robs Th' expecting furrow, and in wild amaze The gazing village point their eyes to heav'n. Where is the tongue can speak the Falc'ner's cares, 'Twixt hopes, and fears, as in a tempest tost? His flutt'ring heart, his varying cheeks confess His inward woe. Now like a wearied stag, That stands at bay, the Hern provokes their rage; Close by his languid wing, in downy plumes Covers his fatal beak, and cautious hides The well-dissembled fraud. The Falcon darts Like light'ning from above, and in her breast Receives the latent death; down plum she falls Bounding from earth, and with her trickling gore Defiles her gaudy Plumage. See, alas! The Falc'ner in despair, his fav'rite Bird Dead at his feet, as of his dearest friend He weeps her fate; he meditates revenge, He storms, he foams, he gives a loose to rage: Nor wants he long the means; the Hern fatigu'd Borne down by numbers yields, and prone on earth He drops: His cruel foes wheeling around Insult at will. The vengeful Falc'ner flies Swift as an arrow shooting to their aid; Then mutt'ring inward curses This is done to prevent his hurting the Hawk: They generally also break their Legs. breaks his wings, And fixes in the ground his hated beak; Sees, with malignant joy, the victors proud Smear'd with his blood, and on his The Reward of the Hawk made of the Brains, Marrow, and Blood, which they call in Italian Soppa. marrow feast. Unhappy Bird! Our Fathers' prime delight! No Man was permitted to shoot within 600 Yards of the Eyrie, or Nest of an Hern, under great Penalties.Who fenc'd thine Eyrie round with sacred laws, Nor mighty Princes now disdain to wear Thy The Hern's Top worn at Coronations here, and by the Great Men in Asia in their Turbants. waving crest, the mark of high command, With gold, and pearl, and brillant gems adorn'd. Now if the crystal stream delight thee more, Sportsman, lead on, where through the reedy bank Th' insinuating waters filter'd stray In many a winding maze. The Wild-Duck there Gluts on the fat'ning ouse, or steals the spawn Of teeming shoals, her more delicious feast. How do the sun-beams on the glassy plain Sport wanton, and amuse our wond'ring eyes With variously reflected changing rays! The murm'ring stream salutes the flow'ry mead That glows with fragrance; Nature all around Consents to bless. What Sluggard now would sink In beds of down? What Miser wou'd not leave His bags untold for this transporting scene? Falc'ner, take care, oppose thy well-train'd Steed. And silly stalk; unhood thy Falcon bold, Observe at feed the unsuspecting team Padling with oary feet: He's seen, they fly. Now at full speed the Falc'ner spurs away T' assist his fav'rite Hawk, she from the rest Has singled out the Mallard young and gay, Whose green and azure brightens in the sun. Swift as the wind that sweeps the desert plain With feet, wings, beak, he cuts the liquid sky: Behoves him now both oar and sail; for see, Th' unequal foe gains on him as he flies. Long holds th' aerial course, they rise, they fall; Now skim in circling rings, then stretch away With all their force, till at one fatal stroke. The vig'rous Hawk, exerting ev'ry nerve, Truss'd in mid-air bears down her captive prey. 'Tis well on earth they fall; for oft the Duck Mistrusts her coward wings, and seeks again The kind protecting flood: If haply then The Falcon rash aim a decisive blow, And spring to gripe her floating prey; at once She dives beneath, and near some osier's root Pops up her head secure; then views her foe Just in the grasping of her fond desires, And in full pride of triumph, whelm'd beneath The gliding stream. Ah! where are now, proud bird! Thy stately trappings, and thy silver bells, Thy glossy plumage, and thy silken crest? Say, tyrant of the skies! Wou'dst thou not now Exchange with thy but late desponding foe Thy dreadful talons, and thy polish'd beak For her web-feet despis'd? How happy they! Who when gay pleasure courts, and fortune smiles, Fear the reverse, with caution tread those paths, Where roses grow, but wily vipers creep? These are expensive joys, fit for the Great Of large domains possess'd: Enough for me To boast the gentle Spar-Hawk on my fist, Or fly the Partridge from the bristly field, Retrieve the covey with my busy train, Or with my soaring Hobby dare the lark. But if the shady woods my cares employ, In quest of feather'd game, my Spaniels beat Puzzling th' entangled copse; and from the brake Push forth the whirring Pheasant; high in air He waves his varied plumes, stretching away With hasty wing. Soon from th' uplifted tube The mimic thunder bursts, the leaden death O'ertakes him; and with many a giddy whirl To earth he falls, and at my feet expires. When Autumn smiles, all-beauteous in decay, And paints each chequer'd grove with various hues; My Setter ranges in the new-shorn fields, His nose in air erect; from ridge to ridge Panting he bounds, his quarter'd ground divides In equal intervals, nor careless leaves One inch untry'd. At length the tainted gales His nostrils wide inhale; quick joy elates His beating heart, which aw'd by discipline Severe, he dares not own; but cautious creeps Low-cow'ring, step by step; at last attains His proper distance; there he stops at once, And points with his instructive nose upon The trembling prey. On wings of winds upborne The floating net unfolded flies; then drops, And the poor flutt'ring captives rise in vain. Or haply on some river's cooling bank, Patiently musing, all intent I stand To hook the scaly glutton. See! down sinks My cork, that faithful monitor; his weight My taper angle bends; surpriz'd, amaz'd, He glitters in the sun, and struggling pants For Liberty, till in the purer air He breathes no more. Such are our pleasing cares, And sweet amusements, such each busy drudge Envious must wish, and all the wise enjoy. Thus, most illustrious Prince, have I presum'd In my obscure sojourn to sing at ease Rural delights, the joy, and sweet repast Of ev'ry noble mind: And now perchance Untimely sing; since from yon neighb'ring shore The grumbling thunder rolls; calm peace alarm'd Starts from her couch, and the rude din of war Sounds harsh in ev'ry ear. But righteous heav'n! Britain deserted, friendless, and alone, Will not as yet despair: Shine but in arms, O Prince, belov'd by all! Patron profess'd Of Liberty! with ev'ry virtue crown'd! Millions shall croud her strand, and her white cliffs, As Tenariff, or Atlas firm, defy The break of seas, and malice of her foes; Nor the proud Gaul prevail where Territa quæsitis ostendit terga Britannis. Lucan. Cæsar fail'd. FINIS.</field>
