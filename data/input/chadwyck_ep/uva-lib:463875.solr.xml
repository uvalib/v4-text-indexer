Your Honours humble Servant, A, Rivers. The Fable of Philo the Jew, Amplified. Tae Argument. Philo the most learned and eloquent amongst the Jewes, recites a very pleasant and witty Storie: Namely, that God after he Phi. lib. de Plantatione Noemi. had with singular art and wisedome created the Universe, commanded the Angels to tell him what they thought of the Work and workmanship: And that one of those blessed Spirits with much freedome answered, that in his judgement there wanted (as a complement to so exquisite an opifice) a strong Voice very audible and penetrating, which without intermission passing from one corner of the Earth to the other, should be the continuall Trumpet of Gods praise, and preach even to the most ignorant his supream wisedome, and ineffable skill in the production of the very least and most contemptible Creatures. This ingenious Fable of Philo is the Argument, and gave occasion to the following Treatise. And though there are those (and not unlearned) who judge it too much to savour of the Pedagogue, when Authors are quoted, yet we think, we shall give authority to our lines, if we expresse the grounds of our invention, and from whence we fetch, and to what direct our Allusions. Who gave himself existence, gave us all Gen. 1. The being that we have, ordered this Ball We trample with a word, and without sweat Gave essence, and existence to the great And lesser Creatures, and requir'd no more Materials pre-existent, then a poore Nothing, and thence with an all-potent hand First made, then perfected Fire, Ayre, Sea, Land. Nor is the worke by patterne, but he takes Himselfe, and of his worke th' Idea makes. VVhen did God make those intellective Peeres The Greek Doctors hold the Angels to have bin created before the world: the Latin D. with the World; which opinion is more probable, though the other is not erronious.Guardians of Mankind, Guiders of the Spheres? Lets reckon every imaginarie Age Before they undertook the Pupillage Of Adams Orphans, or shall we agree As parcels of large Natures Machin, he Gave them Coevall being. How e're wee'l joyne In this, the workmanship was most divine. Did he suite Heaven with a more glorious Robe Then is the garment of our Earthly Globe? D. Th. 1. p. q. 61. art. 3.Is the stuffe other then of things below? Or an extracted Quintessence? be't so Or what it will, we are sure with singular Art God finished, and polisht every part. And viewing all as in a maze he stood And with much Complacence pronounc't all's Good. Gen. 6.VVhen Babels frantick Architects intend Their Tower should as Heavens Pallaces ascend, God goes i'th sacred Triads Companie To view what this presumptuous work should bee, And disallowing their transcendent Pride, He stayes the work, and workmen doth divide. So many Ages past, attended by His glorious Courtiers, he Commands them eye, And curiously observe the worlds vast frame; Then tell him what was wanting in the same. For he had heard (although he let it passe) How Momus had desir'd a looking glasse Should in the brest of man be plac't, to show VVhat were his inward thoughts, that all might know VVhose ends were crooked, whose pretensions right, Discern the just man from the Hypocrite. A fond request, and contrary to that, VVhich when man formed was God leveld at. For he created Men with libertie In will, and action, and if all should see VVhat are the deep designes at which they aime, Both action, and invention, would be lame. As Moyses from Mount Nebo viewd the soile Deut. 34. Of Fertile Chanaan, which by warlike toile The Tribes must gaine, and with their weapons meet Those Regions, which must make their warfare sweet. So in a Moment helpt with glories light, These Angels have presented to their sight The Universe, the Heavens, the Earth, the Seas, And whatsoever is containd in these. In Heaven they see an immense Amplitude, And spatious Tabernacles for the Good (VVho imitating Angels, and by Grace Vanquish the ill with good shall have a place) The many Orbes are objects of their sight, The fixt and wandring Tapers of the Night, VVee'l not believe, but they both see, and know Cornelius a lapide, in Gonesin. VVhat distance is 'twixt Heaven and us below. Should I tell you, that some huge Milstone hurld From th' highest Heaven to th' Center of the world VVould aske twice threescore yeares 'fore it descend, To the said Centre and his journie end. And wee'l allow for every hower, the while It is in motion, at least forty mile. Then guesse what distance is 'twixt Heaven and us, By the swift motion of this ponderous Descendant. Spake I so, you'le laugh and say How know you this? or who hath rid the way? How many are the stages? with the Sun VVho took post horse, and through the Zodiack run? The Angels know this truth; yet in lesse time Then one short hour, a soul that's pure can climbe To th' top of the Empyrean Heavens; such force And expedition hath a vertuous course Of life. Our Angels with amazement viewd The flaming Sun, still burning, nere renewed; Who by the lending of his glorious light Or the with-holding, measures day and night. 'Tis strange so vast a Body every day And every night, should travail so much way, As from the East to West, and then return To make another journey the next morn. We daily see't and therefore make it light, Because it is so daily in our sight. Pererius in Dan esteemes this one of the greatest miracles in nature.Whose hand but the Almighties can sustain Those Magazines of Snow, of Hail, of Rain Ith' Ayrie Regions, that they not descend At once, and with a deluge make an end Of all. VVho firmes the Earth, and with just lines The East, the VVest, the South, the North designes? On what substantiall Bases do's it stand? Or is it propt only by Gods right hand? Job. 38.VVho wrought and put on the main Seas their shrowds And like some new-born babe wrapt 'em in Clouds For swadling clouts? who a confining barre Could set upon 'em, bid 'em passe so farre And passe no further? Thus the Oceans bounds Circling not swallowing the embraced grounds, Are a new wonder. Then amidst the waves They hear how that unweldie Monster raves The VVhale: and laugh at his complaints, because They are injurious to the wholsome Lawes Of God, and nature. Let us hear his song Then vindicate Gods providence from wrong. Is not the whole circumference of the Maine The Baltick Sea, the Seas of France and Spaine, The waves that glide by India, Africa, Sufficient space for him to feed, and play And chase the Orke. Myriads of miles at least Are thought a prison by this Monstrous Beast, And Nature is injurious that hath put Him in a Goale, and in a dungeon shut. Are Londoners in prison 'cause the Line Limits their gadding, and their Outworks confine Their pleasant walkes; the Ocean that surrounds Our Island, washing all our English grounds Speaks England but a Goale. Mans noble mind VVithin this house compos'd of clay confinde, Although it can ith' twinkling of an eye On wings of swift imagination flye Thorough the Vniverse, transcend the skie And comment even on Gods immensitie; Yet is a Captive and close prisoner, (Our mixed Elements the Goalers are) And only death can grant a full discharge, And with his warrant the thrald soul inlarge. But wherefore will Leviathan complaine VVho for his rendevous hath all the Maine And hundreth Seas? Because he cannot go Into the Straits of Archipelago. There the wise God of nature doth provide, VVhere ships continually and Navies ride, Many Charihdaes, Scyllaes dangerous rocks Facing that Isle, where fed the fleecie flocks Of Polypheme. That for the generall good And his own safety, no Atlantick flood Should bear this Monster: but where billowes break At great Alcides Pillars, there they speak A Non plus ultra to the VVhale. For if He enter should the Levant Sea, no Skif, No vessell could be safe: nor he himselfe; But every rock, and every shallow shelfe VVould menace death, and danger: to prevent VVhich inconveniences, wise nature meant, He should be barr'd those Deeps, his duller eye Not able Rocks and dangerous Syrts to spye; VVhich would his too unweldy body teare Peece-meale, and he must every minute feare Present destruction. Should he be pursu'de By covetous man (and certainly he wou'de) VVhat rills of brinish water can he throw, Into the ayre, able to overthrow The largest ship, and with his massie taile, More spread then some huge Carrike under saile, Or'ewhelme and drowne all vessels. To save these Mischiefs, he ne're shall wallow in those Seas. Now judge who is the Prisoner, who has cause To grudge, and challenge Gods, and Natures Lawes. So frantick Man like Absolon takes joy Reg. 2. 8.In that, which shall his happinesse destroy. The shrub envies the Cedar, and the Oake, VVhen that stands firme, these feel the thundring stroke Of angry Heaven. Poore men although despis'd Are safe, when oft the Rich are sacrific'd. VVee'd saile in plenty, but our puft up sailes Are driven as well by rough as prosperous gales; Those promise shipwrack more then these aport, The Cottage hath lesse danger then the Court. Was it not Villers Mothers Adage, shee Vntill a Courtier ne're knew miserie. And Straffords Father did advise his Sonne, To run that race his Ancestors had run. Had he obayed his prudent sire, and lead A private life, no Troops had seen his head Chopt off, and the inconstant Multitude First thirsting, then triumphing in his bloud, This Canterbury, conscious of his parts, How greedily, and with what wilie arts Got he to be a States-man; with what sweat And study did he labour to be great? But whereto serves his Grace, his dignities, But to make more deplorde the Precipice? Yet all like Frantick Icarus will flye Aloft, although they perish in the skye. And Phaeton will beg to guide the Sunne A day, although before that day be done He rue his rash attempt. Such things are sweet That are prohibited, or else not meet. God meanes to give us bread not stinging scorpions, When he raines on us blessings or afflictions. But we divert his purpose, and misuse His providence, not knowing how to use The Duke of Alva observed to be erected, and magnanimous in adversity; Insolent and insulting in prosperity. What he intends for blessings. Many are Like D' Alva's Duke oppressed better far Then in prosperity. But we will runne The wild goose chase untill we are undone. If in adversity say God's unjust; If in prosperity, follow what lust, Spleen, avarice, and ambition dictate, look On lately glorious London. 'Tis a book Worth the perusall: nay let's trace about The Circuite of the Kingdome, and find out What Devill, what Enyo sowed these tares Amongst us, and engendred all these warres, That have destroyed our Brittish Isle, and rent The Kingdome, 'twixt the King and Parliament. Psal.Who sayes who's faulty? He or they? The King A God on Earth, a consecrated thing Cannot transgresse, and being the only source Whence Iustice, and our Laws derive their force Exod.Must needs be pure. They Iethro's Elders are, Englands supreamest Senate, whom the care Of the whole Kingdome chose, to cure the sick Condition of the Body Politick. And 'twere a sin t'imagine these should erre Their own, before their publike good prefer. How then rise all these tumults, these sad jarres The clamour of the Dium, intestine warres? VVhat is the Origen? where springs the cause Of all these plagues we suffer, 'gainst the lawes O reason, dictating that every State Preserve it selfe, not set wide ope a gate To its own destruction, and as Trojans did (Cheated by perjur'd Synon) fondly bid Their foes, nay haile themselves the fatall Steed Stuft with Vlisses, Pyrrhus, Diomed, VVho issuing forth shall Dardans Town destroy, VVith flames consume the lofty Towers of Troy. Speak better Muses, what wrong'd Deitie Hath brought on England so much miserie? VVho has inflamde our English blouds to sheath Their swords in English breasts, and to make Death Ride in such triumph; where our English are The sad attendants of his duskie Car. Reg. 7.VVhen the Assyrians shall be punish'd, God Fetches no hostile forces from abroad, But skares the souldiers with a Pannick fright, And makes Assirians with Assyrians fight: They on themselves their spleen and malice spend, Brother kis brother, friend his dearest friend. Nor can they bragge of Conquest, as no blade But their own swords this bloody slaughter made. We drinke the Dutch downe, and our whoring's more Then the hot Spaniards, more hard to the poore Then Iewes we are; blaspheaming, swearing, play, Our prophanation of the Sabboth day; Cheating our Neighbour: and we have so many Religions with us, that we scarce have any. These sinnes which gliblie we as water drink Iob. 15. 16. Have fil'd the cup of vengeance to the brink, Which God kept still, and would not give command Ps. 7. 4. It should be powred upon Sea and Land By his revenging Ministers, but would So order Iustice that Egyptians should Apoc. 7. Punish Egyptians: heare the Prophets tale How the deluding spirit did prevaile Isai. 19. In wicked Iorams ruine, and be bold, To say Names, changd, of Vs the story told. Heavens Gates were opend, and a Parliament Reg. 3. 32, Proclaimd concerning England: thither went The Cherubin, and Seraphin, the Peeres VVhose constant care it is to volve the spheeres. Angels, Archangels, Principalities, The Thrones, Powers, Vertues, Dominations, these Make the grand Senate, and the VVrit Records; There's no Lower House, but all of them are Lords. The Pursuivants, Informers, Goalers waire, And are attendants; when the Kingdomes State At VVestminster Assembles, to peach those, They vote the Common-weales, and Peaces foes. To take 'em to their stricter Custodie, VVhen 'tis thought fit by the grave Committee. So the black fiends to their Creators Grace, Ingratefull, though they forfeired their place In Heaven, yet when like consultations are, Approach the sacred Court, but stand off far, From glories throne; and answer questions made Touching the lives of men with whom they trade: For did not Satan fully speak his sence, Iob. 1.When God demanded of Iobs innocence? The Synod sat, and the Assembly fild, (Though Heaven is alwayes full) Iehovah wild One of the Cherubs to relate the Cause Of their Convokement. After some short pause A volume is produced, which begins, And ends with the relation of our sins. And every page was blotted, every line, With faults of Peter, Paul, Iohn, Iames, thine, mine, And all were true; should they have been deni'd, The Devills would them all have justifi'd. There was alledg'd we drink the Dutch downe, whore More then the Spaniard, not releive the poore; All our dissemblings, and hypocrisies, Thefts, cheating, swearing, cursing, blasphemies; How we Religion out the Kingdome fright, When for opinions, and our sects we fight. Corruptions in the practise of our lawes; How many injust Verdicts? and the Cause By bribes, or favour thrives. A letter can Corrupt a Iudge, undoe an honest man. The Tribe of Levi stand before the Bar, But as their Acts i'th high Commission are Examin'd; some good Angels undertake Next Parliament should with them order take. Th' inditement being at last fully read out, The Court was silent, and all lookd about; No Advocate stood up, and if there had Been some defendant, our Cause was so bad, No Rhetorick could availe. God does demand How he shall chastise this transgressing Land, The Angels being all mercy would not speak; When a rude multitude of Devills break Into the Conclave, and their ready aide Offering, advise some forraign foe invade The Land, as had the Danes, and Saxons done, And Bastard William the whole Kingdome wonne. But others judge too slow this punishment, Therefore think best a pestilence should be sent Pestilence And in a moment many thousands kill, And hell with soules, the grave with bodies fill. A meaguer Elve, whose thin jawes downwards fall, His teeth appeare, his cheeks no flesh at all Famine. But skin and bones, like some anatomie You see in Chirurgeons Hall, requests that he May be chiefe act our in this businesse, and He would bring Egypts famine on the Land. And this might seem their fitter punishment; Whom wealth and plenty had made insolent. 'Midst these debates from the Abisse of hell (VVhere constant horrour and confusion dwell) A furie came; who flying through the ayre, VVith smoake and flashes, and with thunder, tare Huge Rocks asunder; blasted the green corn, Gave death to blossomes, kild the fruit new born. The ruddie tincture from the Roses fled, The purple violet hung downe his head; The Heliotrope enamor'd of the Sun Fearing his love was lost, the world undone; Dreading now only an eternall shade, Pluckt in his glorious colours and decay'd. Natures vast frame forgets the pristine state, And all her creatures turn retrogradate. So have I seen the boisterous blasts conspire VVith angry heaven, and the Ãtherean fire By furious whirlwinds and tempestuous weather, To dammage the whole Vniverse together. And as the Monster mounted on his way Towards Heaven, the Sun forgetting it was day Vnable, or afraid t'endure the fight Puts out his glorious Taper, and made night. The Fiend arriv'd at the Olympian Gates Crav'd audience, and admittance of the States. Our sins gave easie entrance, (only sinne Can make the Devill ground on mortals winne) Admitted, backward from his threatning front, He twirld the Serpent that hung dangling on't. And with a hideous Roare uttered these words: âYou Citizens of Sion, and blest Lords âConstant possessours of that Grace and roome, âVVhich we have lost by Heavens severest doome. âYou much deliberate; and of your Consults, âVVhat other benefit, but delay results? âHave you resolved that the Brittish Land âMerits chastisement? Does your pleasure stand, âIt shall be punisht? Leave the manner how âAnd meanes to me; only doe you allow. âNor sword, nor plague, nor famine, but all these âBy my invention shall bring miseries âMore then enough upon this Isle; I aske âCommission: grant it; then be it my taske âTo act the Minister of Vengeance. VVayes âI have innumerable: since Adams dayes âI have conversed with his Of-spring: can âTell Arts, how to inveigle foolish Man, âMake him trrnsgresse the precepts of his God; âViolate all Lawes, then whip him with a Rod âSharper then Scorpions: bound up by himselfe, The Court amaz'd at what the Stygian Elfe Had boasted, bid him tell the manner how Hee'd act it: they would his designes allow. Nor should he doubt of their most firm assent It should be voted in the Parliament. Hell and the Devils capred at these words, And with a hushing murmure thankt the Lords. The Fiend erected with such ample leave, Vnfolds how he would his inventions weave. âI'le strait about the Isle my progresse make âAnd with me for my fit associates take âSuspition, Anger, Hatred, Discontent, âMurmure, dislike at present Government; âEnvy and Rancour, Feares and Iealousies, âOpen detractions, more close calumnies, âConspiracie, Rebellion alwayes quaking âFor feare to be surpriz'd: Treason still waking âTo doe a mischiefe. Griping penury âDogging at the heeles of prodigality. âAmbitious hopes to raise what is decaid, âAnd what Peace cannot purchase, by the blade. âThese I'le disperse through the whole Kingdome, and âMake Sons against their Fathers, Brothers band âAgainst their Brothers, when good Abell slain Gen. 4. âFell down, I at the elbow stood of Cain. âSuch industries I have, I can set strife â'Twixt freind and dearest freind; man and his wife. âThe Nobles, Commons, Gentrie, Il'e inflame âWith such dire furies, that the very name âOf Peace shall be detested. Death and blood âTo Nobles, Gentry, and the multitude âShall be most deare: with violence they shall break âOpe Ianus Temple, and the Drum shall speak âIn every Village warre, the Rurall swaine âShall leave his tillage, Shepheards leave the plaine: âThe Prentice shall forget what doe you lack? âAnd joy to March with iron on his back, âThe Murrion on his head. And to advance, âThe common cause, with Gun, with sword, with launce; âThe Citizen weary of rest, lay down âThe Robe of Peace, his gracefull livery gown; âExchange security for doubtfull warres, âAnd deem it honour to return with scarres âFrom the unnaturall conflict; women shall, âAnimate their husbands by the sword to fall: âWives, VViddowes, Virgins, freely give their gold, âAnd with their Iewels bloody strifes uphold. âThough by the warre no other good they reap, âThen to make VViddowes, VVives, and Virgins cheap, âMen easily numbred; VViddowes shall be rife, âAnd no great businesse then to get a wife. âMidst these combustious turmoiles, the Glebe Land, âShall unmanured and untilled stand. âThe plough shall be neglected, and the corn âBy th' horse hoofe trampled, fade before full born â'Tis fit for sickle. Graziers sell away âTheir beasts, lest kept they prove the souldiers pray, âThen want and griping penury shall kill âThe wretches that survive, and Church-yards fill âVVith starved corps; what warre and famine leave, âContagious pestilence shall of life bereave. âSo warre, plague, famine, in a league shall joyne âTo serve you, and performe what I designe. The glorious Senate of the starry Hall Voted allowance, and confirmed all The Fiend demanded. So the sacred Court Dissolves, and every Burges does resort To his happy mansion; all the furies play, And hell triumphing keeps a holy day. For when their Rivall man suffers annoy They have some slight, but momentary joy. The Parliament thus ended, now begins Our misery, and we may thank our sins, Or rather curse 'em, that have brought these woe's On England, made our selves domestick foes Vnto our selves. No fights with France and Spaine, Though we successive warfare with those twaine Have lately wagde, issued so large a flood, As these uncivill broyles of English blood. One onely Sidney slaine, i'th Belgck fights, But numbers numberlesse of Lords and Knights Have perisht in these Conflicts. Let us look VVith gushing eyes on Linsey, Daubeny, Brook, Northampton, Denbigh, Greenvill, Grandison, Should we count all, when would the list be done. Nor can the Conquerour true Trophee raise, As mournfull Cipres not triumphant baies Become the victour, whose felicity Is purchast, with his Countries misery. Great Rome abhor'd any triumphant Car Should grace successes of a Civill VVar; VVhere so much blood, as might whole Regions get Pollutes the Chariot, and the Consuls seat. Have we no doubts of Holland, France, and Spaine? Are the Irish quiet? No hopes to regain The Electorall rights? Or will we not? That we So prodigall in mutuall murthers be? Our England is a shambles; our selves keep The Butchershop: and are our selves the sheep. And when at last we almost all are slain, VVho'l keep us safe from Holland France and Spain? But wee'l leave England weltring in its blood, Permit Leviathan in the Ocean flood. To range, and folowing our main intent, Lift up our eyes to 'th spangled firmament; Where we shall see the Angels, who survaid By Gods command the Fabrick which he made; Having past Heaven, the Ayre, the Sea, the Land At sight of the Ant, in admiration stand. Are there not other objects to delight, The Angels contemplation? Does the sight Of fierce Martichora deterre their view? Dare they not eye him as he does pursue Both Man and Beast? This horrid Monster made By our Step mother, Nature to invade And murther Morrals; seems a subject more Ex Phile. Ãlians, et aliis. Nich. Caus. de eloq. sacra &amp; humana.Worthy their admiration then the poore Emmet. VVhat in his little compound can In them breed wonder, when't doth not in Man? But whose more curious pen had yet the power Rightly to character the Martichore His formidable shape, strength that exceeds The greatest Lyons parched Africk breeds. Body proportioned like that royall Beast That awes the Forrest, Monarck of the rest. The head, and face (O strange) just like the head And face of Man, the skin a Tinto red. Two slambewes for the eyes, the eye lids flush Of brisled haire resembles Moyses bush Exod. 3.Still burning, not consuming: Eares not long, Nor short, tide with a crisped thong Are still erect. His mouth stands open'd wide, Three rowes of Teeth, like Combes on either side. Insinuate a new Hell, that every houre Consume, yet alwayes covet to devoure, Then in his brushie Taile the wondrous strength, In magnitude a Cubit, three in length: With which as some stor'd Magazine well arm'd He enters battaile, and with fury warm'd Assailes the Huntsmen, who pursue him; and Disdaining to be chased, makes a stand And as the Porcupine or Ostrich throwes, His piercing darts amongst his thickest foes. So Roman Legions the swift Parthians dread VVhen as pursu'd, retreating they make head Against their following foes, and dare assaile VVith winged shafts flying as stormes of haile 'Midst the condensed Brigades. In such guise The inraged Monster, with much fury eyes VVhere he shall shoot, then with innumerous store Of forked Iavelins, his pursuers gore. The Taile, his Quiver, and his Bow, which he Can mennage with such rare dexteritie This way, that way, backwards and forwards bend, On every side his dangerous arrowes send, That no side is secure; more, he will take His very nailes, and of them weapons make. Then the bird swifter he, swifter then winde, VVho ever chac'd him but was left behind? Miles nor demensions, cannot hinder him, Come to broad Rivers hee'l leap o're, not swim. If any Creature would the Angels move To wonder, here would be a Theame above The silly Ant. Fond mortall so speak I, But they are better furnisht to descry The artifice of the best Makers hand, And at his workmanship amazed stand. They see the Causes joynd with the effects, VVe see the Creatures, and make them the Text. Of some short wonder, but not mount so high As to the Cause, one onely Deitie. Who only could in his al-knowing mind (The true Idea that showes every kind Of Creatures) first their Natures represent Vnto himselfe, then being omnipotent Existence give, store them with qualities VVhich passe the ignorant, amaze the wise. This, this eternall Mover had a will In the small Ant to shew his infinite skill. And it shall be our better Muses charge To speake the Angels wonderment at large. And thinke the subject well deserves our Rimes When th' Oracles of Learning, and their times Bazil? and Ierome (what a paire of men) On the like Theame imploy'd their sacred pen. 'Tis certain there's some more extensive Art I'th' Fabrick of the World, then of a Part. Yet as much skill to make a Gnat or Flye, As to create the ninefold Hierarchy. Why so? Cannot an Actor merit praise I'th' Idiots part, as well as he that playes The haughty Monarch, and at every straine Expresses Pompey, or great Tamerlane. According to the bulke we value not The Artists skill, but truly estimate Him perfect in his opifice, when he Makes his expressions just as they should be. And our great Artist in the silly Ant, Hath showne more skill then in the Elephant. Here's a vast body able to containe And act all functions which he should ordaine. But in the Pismire how can every sence Be so compleat, and have their Residence? So fit for action, marke the gracefull eyes, The tast, the smell, the feeling, nimble thighs Alwayes in motion. Where the Mussicles? For spleen, gaul, liver, where receptacles? Yet sure all these are there: the wits the arts Contain'd, and practis'd in those slender parts May seem a Prodigie. VVhat vertues crowne The Ants, with which they easily put downe Most of our Mortals. Prudence, Fortitude, Religion, scarce knowne of the multitude, Observ'd exactly in their Common weale VVhere all are daily labourers, none feele, Or know what's want. VVorthy to have for sons, The great Achilles frugall Myrmidons. Lycurgus gloried that he form'd a State In Sparta where no loytring Runnagate VVas to be hir'd to goe on Errands; were Our Land so fortunate, we should not feare In travel to be made the Felons prey, At home to have our goods purloind away. Now idlenesse hath fild full every Goale, Made hard necessity so far prevaile That the every must supply what labour ought; And late repentance at the Gallowes bought, Be dearely rated. These combustions have Planted a Nursery to make fat the Grave, The Gibbets groane, undoe a flourishing Land; VVhilst high wayes eccho with the theeves word, stand. For what can be expected of such men Bred up to spoile and rapine in the Den Of Cacus? loosely dissipating what By plundering, theft, and pillaging was got. But when the clamour of the Drum shall cease, And England be made happy with a Peace The selfe-same riotous and licentious course Begun, must be maintained with a worse. Polib. lib. 1. At large relates the remarkable passages of the Mercenary Warre. And out of him Sir Walter Raleigh in his history of the World.Had not as Rome, proud Carthage as great powers, As large command at Sea, as lofty Towers; As populous a Citie, VValls as strong? In which presuming; they made war so long VVith mighty Rome, in Sicilie and Spaine, And as their losse was equall, so their gaine. Yet when the warres are done and leagues are made, By Mercinaries, Carthage is betraid; And their own souldiers ruine Carthage more Then all the warres they ever wag'd before. As ceasing Hippo, Tunis, Vtica, Solliciting disgusted Africa; They siege the Citie, and the world had seen Carthage in flames, had not Hamilcar been. VVill not the cashirde souldiers imitate These stipendiaries, and undoe our State? VVill not new Spendi and new Mathos rise, And for Remattos make a sacrifice Of glorious London? and our Civill Iarres Conclude at last as theirs with sociall warres? Men bred in ease, accustomed to spoile VVill make a booty of their native soile. And conscious of the mischiefs they have done (VVith Spendius from his Roman Master run) Fearing the penall Lawes and Iustice course, Secure their wicked acts by acting worse. No such Republick 'mongst the Pismires is, But every one taught what belongs to his Duty, performes it cheerfully, and spares No honest toile, but with much labour cares To feed the following winter. In one day VVe consume all, the next look out for prey And so we get a booty, never look How 'tis obtaind, whether by hook or crook. They hoard up corn, but not as Farmers doe And covetous Curmudgions, that undoe The poore and country, to bring out again, And dearly sell it in a dearth of graine. But as good souldiers our industrious Ants Are provident, and skilfull, what sad wants Follow a winter siege, oppresse a Towne Beleaguered, in the spring goe up, and downe In Summer, and in Autumne, bring in grain And plenteous Ammunition, to maintain Their Forts and selves besieg'd by raine, haile, Snowes, Continuall Frosts, (the Emmets yearly foes) To prevent which, they alwayes carefull are And keep themselves in a defensive warre. Nor doe these little creatures alwayes toyle, That would their bodies and continuance spoyle; But have some seasons in their Common-wealth Ordered by nature, to preserve their health; VVherein they celebrate their wakes, hold fares And sequestrated from Domestick cares, Receive each other with much charity, Offer their vowes to hospitality. (A Deity conserving friendship) and Did we their speech and Commerce understand, Their friendly colloquies, kind salutations, Free entertainment, harmlesse recreations; VVee'd judge ther's more true happinesse, true mirth In those Meandred Cavernes of the Earth, Amongst these little Chits, then in the Feasts Of mighty Potentates, where Royall Guests Are entertaind with all magnificence; And much contention to please every sence. Marke Antonie, Lucullus, and Apicius; Never as these made banquets so delicious. Yet all the Kates which in one meale they eate, Mounts only to some twenty cornes of wheat. Fresh River water fild in some Nutshell Shall quench their thirst, and please 'em wondrous well: No healths, but hearty draughts walk round about, For they by rules of nature have found out, Much drinking hurts the health, empties the purse: The deadly bane of wisdome; madnesse, nurse, The fruitfull Mother of fantastick fits, Broacher of quarrels, deluge of best wits. Therefore our Ants who much respect their gaine, Love Peace, are Witty, still preserve their braine. How else could they keep Marts, labour, have health? How in such Peace conserve their Common-wealth? Their Kerimas expired they retire And rest themselves, till Titans cheerfull fire Shall warme the world. Then hating nothing more Then sloth, in thickest Cohorts they explore The adjacent Regions, and bring forage home: Some laden are with wheat, with barley some, And in the way how curteously they meet, And their deare freinds comming full loaden greet? Congratulate their labours, civilly, Decline the path, gently let them passe by? VVhen as a Coach-man and a Car-man chance To meet together, both strive to advance Though one ride empty, th' other full, and all The streets are cumbred as these Carters braule. Nay swords sometimes are drawne, and clubs and staves; And Constables are fetcht to part the knaves. The coached Madamoisels affrighted crie, And skipping out take for their sanctuarie The nearest shop. Our Ants are better taught, And empty yeild the way to such who fraught, With Ammunition travaile. The pert Elves Venture on burthens bigger then themselves, And master 'em as forwards, backwards they Heave at the burthen, and try every way; Nay when the single strength of one or two Helps not, they prove what multitudes can doe Flocking together in condensed bands, And easily conveigh through many hands Their wished loade. So have I seen in Spaine By many Ants, a well-growne Lyzard slaine; And hurried to their holes. There's not more sport In Paris Garden, when they set a sort Of Massive Dogs upon a single Beare, And Beare and Dog shall one another teare, Tug, weary, bite, then when these shall assaile The Lyzard; seize on sides, back, head and tail, Here, there stop him, as if he were in nets, And when with violent force from them he gets, The gathered multitude trip up his heeles, Yet still he strives; but as a Drunkard reeles Stopt by so many, nor can he get far, So vigilant the Interlopers are. Here he falls, there he rises, makes a stand, (And stand he must) whilst they with their black band Assault on all sides, and the eager hounds Following the chase, inflict many slight wounds VVhich multiplyed, prove fatall: he must yeild At last, who 'gainst a Myriad fights a field. VVas it Achilles, or his Myrmidons, That slew the first and best of Priams sonnes? 'Tis certaine Hector was the better Knight, But what one man, can with a thousand fight? Pharaoh is plagu'd with multitude of Flyes, And CÃ¦sar prickt with many bodkins dies. The battaile done, and having got the day They busied are how to dispose the prey. The slaughtred corps for winter must provide, Therefore with skill their Stations they divide. Heave at the carcasse here, there, every where; And by degrees to their dark Cavernes beare. So stones of ponderous weight we often see Carried with art, and like dexterity, To repaire Paules. And if the putrifi'd Corps shall annoy their Garners not well dri'd, VVith the same skill they bring it forth again Expose to the ayre, to heate, to cold, to raine, Vntill at last 'tis season'd and made good, Then carry it back to make their winter food. Of which they are so carefull, that no weather, Shall hinder them their winter crop to gather. And shame our souldiers that goe out to plunder, And having got a petty booty, under Some Taverne, or poore Alehouse roofe devoure Their naughtily gotten prey in one short houre. Emmets no more then men immortall are But sometimes die, yet with more pious care Then many men, they shall be buryed, And obsequies performed to the dead. Vnlesse you fee Sir Richard and the Knave His Clarke; the Sexton that shall dig the grave, Keep your dead bodies, of them Mummie make: No needy soules will churlish Charon take For passengers into his leaking boate, That are not able to defray their groat. How many vertues in our Emmets shine? VVhat providence, what piety? what divine Religion? how much charity to men? As they dig Treasures out the Minerals, then Hide them in holes with much sollicitude, Not avaritious but for mankinds good. For know amongst the Northerne Indians are A race of Ants more great, more fit for warre Then these with us, yet qualifi'd as these With the same graces, the same industries. These as laborious as the others spare No Summer travaile, but with serious care Caufin. Fill Granaries with corne, and in the spring And Autumne daily Ammunition bring Against the winter, nor then will they rest, But digging i'th earths bowels, where the best Silver and gold lie hid, take out the Ore, And in their Cells the precious mettalls store. And knowing how much damage gold do's man, Calepin. Hoard up, and hide with all the care they can Verb. sormic That strong supporter of uncivill Iarres Treasons reward, that sinewes of the warres; That implement of pride and lawlesse pleasures Ambitions nurse, suckled by golden treasures What made great Walstein aime to be a King, But golden Rivers and a silver spring: Albert. Walstone; Duke of Freid land. The fomenters and hatchers of all evill, The best deserving vassailes of the Devill. Ferdinand, the seconds Generall, making a prey of both Imperials and the enemy, in a short time heaped up infinite Treasures. As CÃ¦sars Generall, Villages and Townes He plundered; Nobles, Citizens, and Clownes, And got such summes that nothing could content His swelling spirits, but regall government. What has man got by all the Indian pelfe, But many talents to undoe himselfe. Our England, Ireland, Italy, France, Spaine, Dane, Polak, German, had sufficient gaine Before we understood what Inguts were But when we had full Carracks of them, there Stept in ambition, and deep Policie Aimes at an Europian Monarchie Encourag'd and supported, by that plate Philip of Macedon was wont to say an Asse loaden with gold, would enter any City.That comes from Peru, a most easie gate To enter Kingdomes (did not Philips Asse At any time through any City passe) Where the sword could not? then the world combines And strong against the house of Austria joynes. VVhy was the Spaniard rich? why did he bring The gold from India to undoe his King? 'Twas Charles the fifts wise word, wars had not been So long in Europe, had not Christians seen So much of Spanish gold: Monarkes defray Philip 2. Philip 4.Out their own stock, Rebellious souldiers pay As Philip did, and Philips sonne hath lost The Netherlanders, yet was at the cost To loose 'em. And sad warre shall never cease Either by Conquest or a happy Peace, So long as King and States find any Coyne To maintaine warre. The Chieftaines shall combine On either side: here they shall loose, gaine there; This yeare the States shall winne, the King next yeare. The pay-masters defraud the Captains, they Cheat with false musters them; and of their pay The souldiers. All the Mines of Potasie, Cannot content the avarice of these three. Else how should they maintaine themselves? how keep Their wenches, goe so gallant, play, drink deep? Meane while the Nobles, Peasants, Citizens Fast and doe pennance for the souldiers sins. But now a mighty inundation comes Vpon the Hesperean Monark, 'as his summes Exhausted, every smaller Bird resumes His propper feathers from the Austrian plumes. The Pythagorean Schollers dare divine And Monarchies, and Common-weales consigne To some fixt space, which ended they decay, And in their Empires others beare the sway. Revolve the Chronicles, sixe vultures flow On either side of Romulus, to shew Rome should six hundreth yeares like some new Moon Be still augmenting, and those ages run; Six hundreth yeares Rome daily should goe downe, Vntill at last shee lost the Imperiall Crowne. Let us come nearer. Meronius Race Shall rule two hundreth thirty eight yeares space, Then Pepin, and his Martialists shall come, And inthroniz'd accomplish the same summe. VVhich made compleat, nor past, they are cast downe; And Capet, Valois, Burbon weare the Crown? Are times expired, are the moments run? Must the Hesperean Monarchy be done, Must other Nations in his Empire come, Give Lawes to more then halfe our Christendome? Great Richelieu that Cardinall of France, Vindex revolting from Nero is observed to roule the first stone, which thrust Nero out the Empire. Tacitus. VVith Spaines destruction striving to advance The French affaires, as Vindex roules a stone Likely to justle CÃ¦sar out his Throne. This haughty Prelate like the Ivie growes About the Mother Queen, and overthrowes The Tree which gave him strength. (So many rise By those of whom they make a sacrifice) (VVe daily see so much) preferd by her To th' King, and sworne a Privy Counsellour: As Hannibal, vowes an eternall hate Against the Spaniard, and chiefe Potentate Of Germany. Can such soules that should be The Thrones of Love, Temples of Lenitie Conceive such fires? can Church-men who should breath The Oracles of Peace, speak blood and death? And make our world a new Calvaria; fild With skuls of Gentry, and Plebeians kild. The King of Swedeland.Nay one great Monark to supply a roome, Vouchsafes amongst the rest to have his tombe. Mary Medices Queen of France, the raiser of Cardinall Ric helieu, and by him made forsake the Kingdome,Say (Mary) why hast thou this fire-brand hurld Amongst us to consume the wretched World? Blood was shed fast enough. Why didst thou goe, And fetch a fury from the depths below; To make the world a shambles? But thy sins Are well rewarded, as he first begins With thy confusion: makes thee a Runnagate, A beggar in this Kindome, and that State. So Agrippine will have her Nero raigne, Though as he swayes his Mother shall be slaine. Imperiall Cities are sollicited, The Princes, the Electours, and the Swede. Lexes and Aoolph in strong leagues shall joyn To share Beme, Austria, Franconie, and Rhine. The conquering Swede shall think't a point of State Not to surrender the Palatinate: (Although he had ingag'd his Royall word, Such small fidelity attends the sword.) VVhat pen can write how many plagues invade Afflicted Germany? Fire, Famine, Blade, And pestilence. Ride forty leagues, and you Shall scarce a Village or a Cottage view. I'th' way lie many famish'd corps, that are The bleeding Tests of an inhumane warre. England reflect and feare 'twill be thy fate To be as Germany so unfortunate, Vnlesse the sager Councels of our King And Parliament a mediation bring; And make our Albion happy. VVhy should we (The same blood, Language, Land) so cruell be Vnto ovr selves? at last when all is done, The Sonne shall grieve his Father is undone: The Father that his Sonne is slaine; the Mother Abhorre her Sonne because he kild his Brother. Saturity of Bread, long ease, much pelfe, Makes wanton England fight against it selfe. VVhat France and Spaine could not, abundant store Of gold, has made us miserablie poore. Therefore our Indian Ants in love to man Treasure up gold, and with what art they can Keep't from us, that the ready impliments Of strife remov'd, we buy not penitence At too deare rates. Yet all their industry, Cannot prevent their neighbours treachery. For when Sol mounted high on Leo's back, Or pressing Virgo through the Zodiak Shall drive his steeds and with his scorching fire, Cause the laborious Emmets to retire Vnto their Cells: the false inhabitants Of Darda steale the treasure of our Ants Hid in remoter Magazins, but they Knowing by th' sent the theeves have made a prey Of their concealed wealth, like eager hounds Pursue the flying Felons, and with wounds Recover the lost booty, then returne (Their gold amongst them, in much Triumph borne.) The Conclusion. When the Angels had the ample world survaid, And here and there in much amazement staid, They all agreeing one sole Deitie Could of so rare a work the workman be. âOne added 'twere a Luciferian pride âVVhat's wanting, what's superfluous to decide; âSince he made all whose wisdome best could see, âVVhat, and how fashion'd, things he made, should be. âYet since we have a freedome to unfold âOur sence, had I been Counsellour I would âHave had a voice, more audible and higher âThen of that Trump, which when a generall fire âConsumes the world, shall summon soules to come âTo judgement; and receive their latest doome. âThis every day and houre should walke the round âO'th' spatious Globe, and to the creatures sound âThe praise of their Creatour; with what art âHe made the world, and polisht every part. âHow Heaven and Earth at his appointment stand, âSupported with a finger of his hand. âHow he the watry Meteors, snowes, hailes, raines âI'th' aiery Regions, with a word sustaines; âGives limits to the swelling Ocean: then Iob.âExtols his works amongst the sonnes of men. âHis orderd providence, supreamer love, âEven to his enemies: as from above, âHe sent his only Sonne to pay the price âOf Adams debt, and be a sacrifice âFor mans transgression; with his pretious bloud âPurchast for sinfull man, Beatitude. âSo shall the learned and unlearned know, âVVhence, why, and how the streames of graces flow, âAnd wakened by this voice, their spirits raise, âAnd be the Organs of their Makers praise. Having spoke thus a Seraphin replies, If this were granted, I would then advise âThe VVarlike Drum eternally should cease, âAnd the world gently lul'd asleep by Peace. âThe noyse of warre being like the noise of hell, â(VVhere constant horrour and confusion dwell.) Iob. 7. âVVhere Eccho Drums, and Guns, and Trumpets sound; âTh' harmonious streines of Piety are drownd. âVVe all love man, let's at Jehovah's Throne âPetition, hee'd all differences attone. âAnd Kings and Common-weales to union bring, âThat all may joyntly Allelujahs sing âIn Heaven; where are no jarres, no warres, no strife, âBut full fruition of a blessed life.
