      <field name="fulltext">THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS. CANTO I. THE ARGUMENT. A Christian's struggle (in a dream pourtray'd) To flee from sin, and bid its empire cease, Through him who was for us an offering made, That Satan's pow'r o'er mortals might decrease. Into what snares the Pilgrim was betray'd, And how delivered, by his promised aid Who points the only path to endless peace. I As through life's tangled wilderness I stray'd, Weary of many a woe—with scarce one gleam Of sunshine to illume the lengthen'd shade, Where man man's enemy doth ever seem,— I laid me down; and in a cavern made By nature in a sleep-inviting glade, I dream'd a solemn and instructive dream. II Methought I saw a city dazzling bright, Where all seem'd in pursuit of prospects fair— Of wealth, and fame, and many a proud delight That promised happiness, but led to care: And smiles that spoke serenity, at sight, Yet mask'd false heart, hypocrisy, and slight; And vanity, and guile, and fraud, were there. III And, hastening from that town, in pauper guise, I saw a burthen'd man, with face engraved By furrows deep of care; his tearful eyes Fix'd on a Volume, whence methought he craved That counsel, which, how many fools despise! And sobb'd, with bitter and heart-rending cries, “What shall I do, Oh tell me, to be saved?” IV The burthen under which his frame was bent Seem'd weight of sin; the Volume in his hand Contained that undervalued Testament, The love of which none may misunderstand; Its consolations, to poor wanderers sent, Half Satan's kingdom hath already rent, Nor shall all Hell its final power withstand. V Reading this book, he ran, as he had need, Maugre the ever-galling weight he bore, (For 'tis a Volume he who runs may read;) And though his wife, methought, with infants four, Would fain arrest his course, he took no heed, But stopp'd his ears, and with redoubled speed Urg'd his half-frantic footsteps but the more! VI While thus proceeding, (as I dream'd,) a man He met, of serious mien, who ask'd him “Why, “As one bereft of reason, thus he ran, “With ever and anon that piercing cry?” To whom, in faultering accent, he began To answer, “I'm condemn'd! Say, if you can, “What shall I do? Oh save me, or I die!” VII Evangelist, for so the sage was call'd, A parchment gave, which did these words display, Flee from the wrath to come! “Be not appall'd,” He added, “for escape, there is a way, “Through yon straight gate, to all who are enthrall'd:” And pointed to a portal, close enwall'd, But girt with glory, far surpassing day. VIII The thankful sinner sought the haven, where He hoped admission, that he might essay The road to his release from worldly care, When two o'erbusy neighbours cross'd his way, In mind well suited to the names they bear, Of Obstinate, and Pliable: this pair Against him set themselves in pert array. IX “Return with us,” quoth Obstinate, “nor let “Enthusiastic trash your mind mislead.” “Go on with me,” the Pilgrim said, “while yet “'Tis time,—nor any earthly hindrance plead; “Hasten! Oh hasten! ere the sun has set, “To him whose love redeems your ev'ry debt, “And asks but your concurrence to be freed.” X “Tales told by idiots!” Obstinate replied: “Come, neighbour, leave the maniac to prate!” But Pliable imagined he espied Some muckworm prospect of advantage great, And answer'd, “Ere with prejudice decide, “I will the pious Pilgrim's lot abide, “And share, or good or ill, his future fate.” XI With grin sardonic, Obstinate went back, While Pliable and Pilgrim, side by side, Progress conversing;—Pilgrim, with no lack Of sanguine confidence, the world defied To turn his footsteps from their present track; Or, with successful sophistry, attack His hope, howe'er such hope they might deride. XII But “too secure” is not “too safe,” I ween, While hidden peril in our path may lie; And so it proved:—a pitfall deep, unseen, By treacherous weeds, impervious to the eye, Deceiv'd the pair, as through its “mantle green” They fell, with exclamation loud and keen, Deep in the Slough of dark Despondency. XIII Himself to free, first Pliable applied, With many a plunge and struggle, till at last He gained his homeward path, then loudly cried Against his fellow, (still imbedded fast, And deeper sinking,) and began deride His journey's object, as with humbled pride He quick retraced the road so lately pass'd. XIV And retrograding through bye-path and lane, Where best he observation might avoid, For he was deeply soil'd by many a stain From that black slough which much his pride annoy'd; Yet tried to laugh, as heedless, but in vain, Deriding neighbours cried “What! turn'd again! “How soon some fools with too hot zeal are cloy'd.” XV And Obstinate jeer'd Pliable the most, While he the blame on Pilgrim tried to lay, And “that he left him sinking,” made his boast, When, looking to himself, he ran away. This swell'd his persecutors to an host, (For good or bad scorn who deserts his post,) And he was glad to shrink from face of day. XVI Return we now where, destitute of aid, The fainting Pilgrim call'd on Man in vain, Loathing his life, and yet of death afraid, Each way he turn'd some footing to maintain; And much his heedless pride did he upbraid, 'Till fervently for Heav'nly help he pray'd,— Then help appear'd, and he was safe again. XVII And when he had replaced him on the road, Help chid the Pilgrim, that he did not find Those steps (God's promises) which are bestow'd Across that quagmire, where alone the blind May miss their way: but Pilgrim's pond'rous load Had plunged him deeper in that black abode, Where he'd been lost but for that Helper kind. XVIII Yet scarcely did that help depart, when lo! Another peril the poor soul beset, One Worldly Wiseman, true conviction's foe, Fast caught the Pilgrim in his treacherous net, And with persuasives, that like milk did flow, Won him that to Morality he'd go, By legal means to pay his countless debt. XIX For “Sooner,” the deceiver said, “by far “The burthen would be loos'd, and with more ease, “By wise secession from a senseless war “'Gainst rational enjoyments, framed to please “The moral sense, and which could be no bar “To Heaven's acceptance.” Pilgrim's happier star Grew dim, when he was won by words like these. XX Then “If we dare imagine angels weep,” Their tears fell fast when, as his back he turn'd On the straight way. Repentance seem'd to sleep, As with new fangled, fickle hopes, he burn'd; And Worldly Wiseman's exultation deep Hypocrisy had taught him close to keep Within a breast that Gospel goodness spurn'd. XXI Near to a fearful hill their progress lay, Sinai, famous in the Holy Land For wonders those dread Chronicles pourtray Which, haply, still were in the Pilgrim's hand. And, as they urg'd their legal, lawless way, From clouds that paralyzed the face of day Came lightnings which no sinner might withstand. XXII The moral tempter fled! His victim too Had fallen, but the sacred tome he bore Sustain'd him; and he 'gan to feel anew Conviction, prompted by its saving lore: And while he, sighing, wist not what to do, Close to his side he hail'd, with joyful view, Evangelist, his friend so late before. XXIII Yet sterner than of yore his awful brow, As he the soul-struck renegade surveys, And, with paternal anger, asks him how He dared desert his hopes for flattering ways, Which lead to wrath and danger, as but now; Then bade him teach his heart subdued to bow In humblest offering of prayer and praise. XXIV “Morality,” he added, “has no pow'r “To ease thee of thy burthen, nor atone “Thy sins—Still less has law. The happy hour “For grace, is when true faith pervades alone “Regenerated bosoms—'Tis a tow'r “High above legal fetters, which devour “The victims who beneath their bondage groan.” XXV In confirmation of the truths he told, Evangelist, endow'd with power, like those Who prophesied, in Israel's day of old, Against whoe'er did Heaven's hests oppose, Adjured the mountain, when again behold! Fierce lurid flames its summit high enfold, And earth seem'd bursting with convulsive throes. XXVI Astounded! terror-stricken! bow'd with shame! The Pilgrim scarce dare ask, “May he resume “His path forsaken.”—Much was he to blame. Just then a radiant smile seem'd to illume, (As in my dream I thought,) the teacher's frame, Who bade the pardon'd turn to whence he came, And hope's sweet flow'rets seem'd once more to bloom. XXVII The kiss of peace receiv'd, the Pilgrim hied More swiftly back than mortal might suppose, Right sick and weary of mistaken pride, And legal subtleties, and moral foes. Now, with dear-bought experience for his guide, He circumspectly watches far and wide, As, joyful in humility, he goes. XXVIII The light-press'd turf scarce touching, as methought, He ran, or rather flew, till, at that gate So lately swerved from, now sincerely sought, He stood, and, trembling seem'd awhile to wait, Fearing lest yet his hopes might come to nought, Till, in his name whose blood salvation bought, He boldly knocked,—impatient of his fate. XXIX Yet no discouragement might well appear, For, o'er the architrave, a sentence fair, In bold relief, and with inscription clear, This heavenly assurance seem'd to bear: “Knock, and it shall be open'd,”—framed to cheer The lowliest in hope, and banish fear From all who seek to gain admittance there. XXX But then, methought, a gloomy fortress, black With age and perish'd ivy, stood anigh, From whence fierce fiends were ready to attack With poison'd darts such pilgrim passers-by As turn upon the wiles of hell their back; And much of Christian armour doth it lack, To shield poor souls where Satan's arrows fly. XXXI Yet these our Pilgrim saw not, for indeed His faculties were all absorb'd, and bent On seeking what he found—for in his need The gate was open'd; and, with kind intent, The porter pluck'd him forward, and, when he Ask'd “Why that friendly violence might be?” The shut out castle told him what it meant. XXXII Past grief and present ecstasy o'ercame The fainting Pilgrim, thankful most for this, That, undeterr'd by worldly sense of shame, He had attain'd the gate to future bliss. “Inveni portum!” might he well exclaim: And when Goodwill, the porter, ask'd his name, All fear, while answ'ring thus, did he dismiss: XXXIII “Till late, and justly, Graceless was I call'd, “The city of Destruction gave me birth, “And ne'er was wretched culprit more enthrall'd “By snares, most gilded when of meanest worth. “I'm now named Christian; and, I hope, enstall'd “In Mercy's seat, no more to be appall'd, “Or yet deceiv'd by Satan's pow'r on earth.” XXXIV And, as he spoke, a sweet seraphic strain Of countless harps, harmonious, swell'd in air: ('Twas but a dream, but yet to hear again That heav'nly music, I, methought, could share An age of this world's agony and pain, But here, on earth, to hope it, were in vain;) While cherub choirs this burthen seem'd to bear: CHORUS. Halleluja! the Pilgrim a welcome receives, The portal to mercy he sought and obtains; His doubts are dispell'd, while he hopes and believes Grace conquers the heart where a Saviour's love reigns. END OF CANTO I. CANTO II. THE ARGUMENT. The straight gate pass'd, the Christian burns to know Where from his burthen he relief may find, And (taught by one ordain'd those things to shew, Which, well interpreted, exalt the mind High o'er the poor pursuit of toys below,) Attains that balm which only can bestow Health on the sick, and eyesight to the blind. I “An open door is set before thee now, “A door no man may shut,” the porter cried; “And, having put thine hand unto the plough, “Turn thou not back, and God will be thy guide. The gladsome Pilgrim answered, “Teach me how, “Grateful within his holy courts to bow, “Who, for my soul's sake, like a felon died.” II And then did Christian, with o'erflowing heart, To questions from the porter, make reply, Attempting in faint idiom to impart What fears induced him from his home to fly; While in his breast the deeply-rankling dart Of Sin doth hourly cause increasing smart, As with new weight his burthen seem'd to lie. III And next, with retrospection clear and brief, The dangers, just escaped from, he pourtray'd, From deep despondency his late relief, And Pliable's defection. How betray'd By Worldly Wiseman into disbelief, Dwelling, with vivid memory, in chief On Sinai's lightnings and the Prophet's aid! IV And when his hearer bade him persevere, And keep the narrow path, the Pilgrim pray'd Present relief from agony severe, Caus'd by that load which on his conscience weigh'd. “Pass on,” the porter answered, “though not here “Thy place of refuge, 'tis provided near: “Go forward, firm in faith and undismay'd!” V Now Christian journey'd on a space, methought, Directed to a mansion, where my dream Presented one who ev'ry pilgrim taught How to interpret mysteries that seem At first obscure. Those who his dwelling sought Were entertained, and sweet instruction bought For thanks, which past all price they well might deem.” VI Here once more question'd, and with joy receiv'd, By Scripture light the Pilgrim first is shown The effigy of one who disbeliev'd His Master's mission, and was, whilom, known Chief foe to Christ's disciples, whom he griev'd With persecution fierce—himself deceiv'd By Satan, who had mark'd him for his own. VII Yet did his victim from the fiend get free;— For Paul, when most inflam'd with bigot rage Against God's own, was by him call'd to be The Christian's Champion, and, who late did wage Fell war against the Cross, its servant see That Cross to bear none more resolv'd than he,— Christ's great Apostle in a ruthless age. VIII Next, led by the Interpreter, within A long neglected hall, the Pilgrim saw One sweep till dust obscured (that dust meant sin, The heedless sweeper typified the law,) And Gospel Grace was by her Lord call'd in, Who that dense cloud to sprinkle did begin; Till when, the breath of life none there could draw. IX Then, in my dream, I saw two children fair, Passion and Patience call'd; the host untired, When Christian ask'd what moral they might bear, Bade him observe—The first named youth desired Present possession of his fortune there; While Patience for the future felt more care, Consenting to await a time required. X And Passion's wishes granted, he obtain'd Instant supplies, which instantly he spent; While Patience, by forbearing, prudence gain'd; Wealth much increas'd, and blest with sweet content; When Passion, with distracted mien complain'd That of his patrimony nought remain'd, Which came too quickly, and as quickly went. XI And now methought a furnace seem'd to blaze Beyond each envious effort to subdue Its force, by one who water's power essays, By which opposed, that fire more ardent grew; For, unobserv'd, a fostering hand conveys Rich streams of oil the sinking flame to raise, And all its vital influence renew. XII And this interpretation gave the host,— The fire is love of God, the crafty foe Who cast cold water is the Fiend, engross'd In quenching Truth wherever it may glow; And he whose holy oil succeeded most In keeping grace alive, may Christians boast The friend of ev'ry wanderer here below. XIII A gorgeous palace next arose, methought, Whose meanest inmates walk'd in robes of gold, There none admittance found but those who fought The fight of faith with resolution bold; Their names recorded, and their victory bought With persevering courage, we were taught, Entitled them to happiness untold. XIV Dark grew the chamber, and an iron cage, In which we saw, array'd in squalid guise, Deform'd alternately by grief and rage, A wretched, never dying captive rise. With whom did Christian reason, to assuage His careless agony in that last stage Of misery too acute for mortal eyes! XV “All cherish hope,” the anxious Pilgrim said. “All but the victims of despair, like me,” Replied the pris'ner; “here all hope is dead, “And lost in terror of eternity! “To every vice, deceit, and folly wed, “I've drawn a curse on this devoted head, “From which I never, never can be free.” XVI “Your God I tempted, crucified his Son,— “Despised, derided, curs'd his sacred name,— “No limit marks the evil I have done, “When, shame to man, I gloried in my shame; “Harden'd in heart, my race was scarcely run, “When by the powers of hell that heart was won, “And willingly their victim I became!” XVII “Is there no hope?” the trembling Pilgrim cried; “Is there no pardon left in Mercy's store “For that man's guilt?” The host with grief replied, “Christ's blessed cross man's expiation bore; “And he by whom that cross is once denied, “Its virtue slander'd, and its God defied, “May well fear mercy lives for him no more.” XVIII Then Christian, in whose mind these warnings sank, His burthen seem'd to feel with added weight; And, as he feebly tried his host to thank, He ask'd to go, lest he might come too late, Where such as sought the cup of mercy, drank Release from sin, and privilege to rank With those whom Heaven's promised joys await. XIX “Yet one more lesson, and in peace depart,” Rejoin'd the mild instructor of his guest: “Behold that sleeper waking; human art “Ne'er painted man with fear so well express'd. “And while strange meanings from each eyeball dart, “You view the palpitation of a heart “Which agitates his undulating vest.” XX “What is thy dread, and why that pallid hue, “Those trembling limbs, and that keen, haggard eye?” Demanded Christian. “Is it, is it true, “Or fancy all?” The dreamer made reply: “Methought I went where all receive their due, “The judgment-seat of God was in my view, “Nor could I from his awful presence fly. XXI “I heard the final trumpet's dreadful blast, “Beheld an eye all-searching!—still I see, “Though turn'd to each around, from first to last, “How all its energies seem'd fix'd on me! “Gather the wheat into my garner! Cast,” “A voice proclaim'd, “the chaff and tares bound fast “Into the burning lake! 'tis God's decree.” XXII “And myriads of immortals, Oh how fair! “On wings of flame, by far outstript the wind, “And bore the righteous upward—what despair “Seiz'd on this heart when I was left behind; “If but a vision, all my future care “Shall be, through faith, past error to repair, “And keep that eye for ever in my mind.” XXIII “And so will I,” thought Christian, who at last Exchanged farewells, and hasten'd, that he might While on his road, revolve instructions past, And, by their guidance, make his burthen light; For heavier it seem'd, and bound more fast, Till nearly sinking, and with pain aghast, His startled eve beheld a fearful sight. XXIV A cross, which waken'd in the Pilgrim's mind The memory of all his Master's pain,— A sepulchre, where those who ask, may find A refuge from the ills of Satan's reign. This Christian found, through him whose mercies kind His burthen to that sepulchre consign'd, And bade exstatic joy succeed to pain! XXV Moment of glory! where's the sceptred king In battle's triumph, or the brighter hour Of bidding subjects' hearts with rapture sing, By mingling mercy with the sweets of power? What were all pomp prosperity can bring, Or what the smiles of any earthly thing To tears that down that pilgrim's cheek did shower? XXVI He saw the load of wretchedness that long Had threaten'd fearful, everlasting doom, Pride, envy, avarice, and every wrong That rose in judgment, now were in the tomb! Like incense upward rose the grateful song, Like Sampson's bold enigma, sweet yet strong, Soft and ascending as the eaglet's plume. XXVII Ye self-dubb'd Deists, and ye Atheist tribe, Whose “march of intellect,” with fell pretence Would mock Omnipotence, and dare prescribe Your limit to his wisdom, get ye hence! That plastic youth no longer may imbibe The damning doctrines ye would fain inscribe On hearts just opening to the joys of sense. XXVIII Though before men ye rave, yet at his nod Who sees in secret, ye in secret quail, If “wit's a feather, and a fool a rod,” What's he whose arrogance presumes to rail; And, worse than fool, whose wit derides his God: Oh! when in death such view the path they've trod, How then will impious sophistry avail? XXIX Though feeling not the burthen they now bear Of sin against the light, yet may that grace They would be thought to scoff at, lead them where, Like Christian, they may find God's word replace Their weight of error with conviction fair Of heav'nly mercy, and a Saviour's care, While they his love unparallel'd embrace. XXX So thankfully felt heart-whole Christian when He lightly left the evil he had borne, So gratefully he praised his Saviour then, (The only comforter of souls forlorn;) Most happy he among the sons of men; And Truth must picture with an angel's pen His joy to paint, who did so lately mourn. XXXI And now in robes of “silver dipp'd in light” Three forms seraphic hail'd him: who shall tell The adoration, blinded with delight, That fill'd his soul but now redeem'd from hell. Like suns unclouded now his prospects bright, And while their smiles celestial glad his sight, Before those angel forms the Pilgrim fell. XXXII “Peace to thee, Christian!” they exclaim'd, “thou'rt blest “In having listen'd to the small still voice: “Thy sins are all forgiven! Be at rest! “This robe of righteousness, thy wisdom's choice, “Be thine!—No more in Satan's liv'ry drest; “And with this seal thy forehead be imprest; Peace to thee, Christian! in thy lot rejoice. XXXIII And then, methought, a golden lettered roll They gave, and on its surface was engraved The catalogue of sin to which his soul, Now free as ambient air, was late enslaved, With heaven's pardon added. When the whole He had perused, he kissed the welcome scroll, And o'er his head his hand triumphant waved. XXXIV Now forward boldly with repeated song, And feathery foot, and happy heart, his way To Zion-ward he took—I look'd, and long Methought the cherub trio seem'd to pray; Then in a hymn (while some ærial throng Of minstrels loudly joined the sacred song,) With heavenly accent they attuned this lay: XXXV “Yes! yes! in heav'n there is more joy! “More loudly to Jehovah's name we sing, “When one poor soul whom Satan would destroy, “Is rescued to the glory of our King! XXXVI “More tears of holy rapture then are shed, “More chords of adoration thrill the lyre, “For one no longer to his Saviour dead, “Than ninety-nine unsinning souls inspire. XXXVII “Father, I've sinn'd!” the Prodigal exclaim'd, “No longer worthy to be call'd thy son!” Heav'n smiles! the Saviour's fiat is proclaim'd, And gain'd through Christ! the sought for prize is won. CELESTIAL CHORUS. And then in Heav'n there is more joy, More loudly to Jehovah's name we sing, When one poor soul whom Satan would destroy, Is rescued by the mercy of our King! END OF CANTO II. CANTO III. THE ARGUMENT. The Pilgrim's Progress still, from want of heed, Is liable to error; sleepers, thieves, With hills of difficulty, check its speed; And Christian many a lesson sharp receives. The Palace Beautiful, in hour of need, Protects him, and, from by-gone terrors freed, Armour of light assists him to proceed. I Free from the past, the Christian's future care Is how to shun improvident neglect, Guarding his progress so as to beware Of losing his blest place with Heaven's elect; For even the “chosen few” find many a snare, Which, to escape, ask watch, and fervent prayer To Him, who only can their steps protect. II With more than former caution, then, he goes Fearing unnumber'd, unforeseen mishaps, Which hourly may surround him, for he knows No danger to the soul is like Relapse; And, sad experience tells the countless woes, The bitter, vain regrets, and griefs of those Whom, once escaped, the Fiend again entraps. III A little onward, in a sombre glen, Three fetter'd fools he saw enwrapp'd in sleep, Presumption, Sloth, and Simple, call'd, these men Good Christian fain would waken, but too deep Their slumbers—to remonstrance, now and then, They, dreaming, answer'd, turn'd, and slept again, Powerless their leaden lids alive to keep. IV He left them, grieving inwardly with shame, That man should be of indolence the prey So much as to incur the sinful blame Of turning into night the glorious day; When, o'er a wall, two interlopers came, Hypocrisy and Formalist, by name, With bold intrusion on that sacred way. V To whom thus Christian, “Are ye not aware “That ‘He who cometh in not by the gate, “But climbeth fences as marauders dare, “Must as a thief be counted?’” They, elate With easy entrance, answer'd, “Little care “Have we, but that we're here; and custom fair “Supports us, which for years on years we date.” VI “To plead such custom will no favour gain “Where this road ends,” the Pilgrim firm replied. But all essay of argument was vain; Himself, and robe celestial, they deride: But little by such scorn did they obtain, He forward pass'd, untouch'd by their disdain, Or threats, or ridicule, which he despised. VII And, shutting out all meaner objects then, His pardon, late inscribed, he oft perused, Unmindful of those poor besotted men, Who, following, ferociously abused All “saintly hypocrites;” and rail'd till when They found two paths: this led to danger's den, That to destruction,—both too often used! VIII The narrow way they left, wound up a hill Call'd “difficult,” which Christian wisely chose; The others took each path to certain ill, And perish'd both! The Pilgrim slowly rose From obstacle to obstacle, until He found an arbour, near a murmuring rill, Which lull'd his weary senses to repose. IX Here had he careless slept till the last rays Of day had left him, but a voice said “Rise! “Go to the ant, thou sluggard! mark her ways, “And learn by her example to be wise!” No second warning needs he: in amaze, He instant, to atone for past delays, And gain the summit, all his power applies. X Upward he toils, the pinnacle at last Surmounting, joyfully he looks around: When fearing each to be in speed surpast, A breathless pair scarce seem'd to touch the ground; No coward caitiffs ere were more aghast, Or from imagined danger ran as fast, As they, who cried “Back! back!” with look astound. XI Mistrust and Timorous the trembling two Were designated; Christian mark'd their flight, And ask'd “Why they return'd, when they might rue “Their retrograding thus in causeless fright?” “They meant,” they said, “no longer to pursue “A path where danger ever is in view:” And Christian thus they urged to share their flight: XII “Passing but now yon angle of the rock, “We saw a palace brilliant as the day,— “Approach'd it; and, as if our hopes to mock, “Across the threshold two fierce lions lay: “Haply of such there may remain a flock “Our further passage on that road to block, “And henceforth those who chuse such dangers may!” XIII “Unless fears magnify,” the Pilgrim said, “You may, from what you've seen, your progress stay; “But I, whate'er may be the cause for dread, “Will to no earthly obstacle give way: “Should I, where could I hide my recreant head, “Or hope in heav'n to break of life the bread, “If I our Master's cause could so betray? XIV “My home I fled from, lest the wrath to come “Should, after life, my dreadful portion be; “If I return, I court the awful doom “Which has so lately been remitted me! “Lions, or flames, or sword, may to the tomb “Conduct, but then above there's ample room “For all who only would through Christ be free.” XV The couple heard not, but adown the hill They fled amain, and Christian with a smile Then thought that to suspend all thoughts of ill, And make the future, present cares beguile, He'd once more read his pardon; and I still Remember how all hope it seem'd to kill, When he that pardon found not! Woe the while! XVI Before his God whose gift he should have kept, By which alone his journey could avail, He mourn'd his ingrate heedlessness and wept, Retraced his steps with fruitless woe and wail, Till he regain'd that arbour where he'd slept; Still praying that his Saviour would accept The deep contrition of a heart so frail. XVII “I who condemned the sleepers in the dell, “The beam beheld not in my own weak sight, “Too blind, while judging others, to foretell “The deeper guilt I should incur ere night. “A treasure which for worlds I would not sell “Was mine, and I was told to guard it well— “'Tis gone! and with it all of hope takes flight. XVIII “That jewel, far above all price to win, “Wife, infants, roof, and ev'ry tie on earth “I left; for what to me were friends or kin “To such a gem of true celestial worth? “A charm to banish every ill within, “My great physician for each mortal sin, “My soul's certificate of second birth! XIX “Arm'd with that talisman, there's not a foe “Could bar my way, or cause one serious grief. “Now spiritless, defenceless, must I go, “And tremble at the shaking of a leaf: “Then from my Judge will come the final blow, “Commencing my hereafter endless woe— “Cast out! condemned! rejected as a thief!” XX If thus the weeping Pilgrim mourned his fate, And sank, despairing, on that arbour-seat Where his first duty slighting, as of late The conqueror of self-sustain'd defeat, Who shall the contrast of his joy relate, Or paint his frantically happy state, When that prized scroll again his sight did greet? XXI Imagine captive monarchs from their chains By sudden justice to their state restored; A lover whose fond suit his love disdains, At once accepted by the maid adored; Or husband weeping o'er the pale remains Of her who by some miracle regains Life, health, and love, to bless her happy lord. XXII Imagine these, and greater joys combined, And Christian's transports far exceeded all;— All earthly bliss was in that scroll entwined, And more beyond this little transient ball: The arbour now again he leaves behind, With bursting heart, and humbly happier mind Than e'er did yet his pilgrimage befal. XXIII Thrice happy Christian, in one moment tost On Passion's wave, the next to be at peace; His fault retrieving at but little cost, So soon he found his recent anguish cease. Well are we taught, that never till 'tis lost We estimate a blessing! Winter's frost To memory of the rose gives large increase. XXIV And now, when shades of night on ev'ry side Curtain'd the horizon till scarce a spark Of light cheer'd Christian o'er that mountain wide, Through paths of peril, dreary, cold, and dark; Yet did he persevere till he descried That palace which, with hospitable pride, Blazed, as on ocean shines the seaman's mark. XXV This he approach'd with animated pace, For, nearing home, exhaustion we forget; Refreshed by hope, of fear he show'd no trace, When one more trial seem'd to wait him yet: On either side with fierce colossal grace A lordly lion seem'd to guard a place Where none with life might entrance hope to get. XXVI He now to memory recall'd the flight Of those seceders, Timorous and Mistrust, And then resolved, come danger as it might, Where duty pointed,—“On!” obey he must; Displaying then the scroll, his heart grew light, Fearless (like Paul at Ephesus) to fight With lions in his cause who aids the just! XXVII During the pause this brief reflection made, A portal of the palace fair and wide Was open'd; and aloud, “Be not afraid, “Come boldly on!” a kind domestic cried; “Nor be at those, our lion-guards, dismay'd; “Placed only that your faith may be essay'd; “Pass midway, and their threats may be defied.” XXVIII Midway he pass'd, and, nearer, saw the pair Were safe encircled by a massy chain, Each to its limit march'd, with savage stare, And with fell roar they threaten'd, but in vain: Christian went on, divested of all care, But gratitude to him who brought him there, After a day of so much anxious pain. XXIX Safe at the portal, Christian there repeats, To questions ask'd him, Whence? and Why he came So late for shelter?—Tells of his defeats, Triumphs, and troubles, nor conceals his shame For sleeping on his watch.—His frankness meets Deserv'd reward: a lovely damsel greets His entrance next,—Discretion was her name. XXX To her she call'd, each than herself more fair, Three other maidens,—Prudence, tho' reserved, And tranquil, soft as summer dew, was there: Next Piety, whose bosom never swerv'd From sweet sincerity of praise and prayer: But, in my dream, methought, beyond compare, Smiled Charity, who well the palm deserv'd. XXXI These (while his weary spirit to recruit, Others the table hospitably spread With needful food, and generous wine and fruit, Or smooth'd a pillow for the Pilgrim's head,) Join'd in such converse as such hearts may suit, With Freedom and Good-nature; neither mute On subjects which to kind Instruction led. XXXII And while he supp'd they ask'd of Christian why He left his partner, and her offspring dear, Preferring, though it was for life, to fly A solitary Pilgrim? With a tear But ill suppress'd, and many a struggling sigh, “For them,” he said, “alas! with joy I'd die, My soul's salvation only is more dear!” XXXIII “Who could her infants from a mother take?— “And she, though I besought her by all love “To fly destruction, for those children's sake, “For mine, for her's, for His who rules above: “I tried in vain her feelings to awake, “No argument her wilfulness could shake, “But only mockery and scorn could move.” XXXIV “God, in his time, her purposes may change;” The Sisters answer'd—To amuse his woe. They promised, on the morrow, all of strange And high import, that house contain'd, to show: That night he rested, yet his thoughts would range From heav'n to home,—a home he'd but exchange For that new world to which he look'd to go. XXXV Two days the Pilgrim they detain'd, and ere He journey'd on, their promise they redeem'd, By exhibition of all rich, or rare, Or sacred, by the wise and good were deemed Among their treasure:—from a terrace fair He saw the road he yet must travel, where If peril threatened, much of mercy beam'd. XXXVI He saw the sword Philistia's champion drew; The humble scrip where Israel's future king That missile carried which Goliah slew; The herdsman's mantle and unerring sling; The legislator's rod next met his view, With which, in time of thirst, the Hebrew drew From rocks, relief no power but heav'n's could bring. XXXVII The simple weapon Sampson chanced to wield, Which Pagan foes most fatally annoy'd, The oxen's goad, which, when he took the field Shamgar, with equal bravery employ'd; The fatal nail from which no pow'r could shield Proud Sisera, to woman doom'd to yield, And Gideon's arms which Midia's sons destroy'd. XXXVII But most of all elated was their guest, When from the armoury desired to take Whate'er he would select from all the rest, And arm himself to battle for His sake, Who bids us “fight the fight;” to which behest, Bowing, in panoply of proof now drest, He burns in arms his first essay to make. XXXIX When Christian at the wicket-gate went in, The choir celestial tuned their harps on high, When, at the cross he left his weight of sin, Again they joined in grateful harmony; And now once more I heard the strain begin, “The Christian soldier arms, for God to win, “Or wear in death the palm of victory!” END OF CANTO III. CANTO IV. THE ARGUMENT. Discretion, Prudence, Piety, attend The Pilgrim's steps, and put him on his way; And Charity, of all mankind the friend, Imparts her kindness. A most glorious day Awaits the Soldier, eager to defend His Master's cause. A dreadful combat's end Proves Christian victor, to the Fiend's dismay. I “Dreams are but interludes which fancy makes,” A bard once sang: and yet we may not deem That fancy errs, in ev'ry road she takes, Or every vision but a baseless dream: When Bunyan slumbers, then he best awakes Conviction in the faithless, for whose sakes Plain truths he tells, howe'er they fictions seem. II Homely his idiom, which, more homely, I Have haply render'd in my humble verse; Yet hope, if given with fidelity, The matter for the manner not made worse. Certes, a Muse beyond all praise should fly On such a theme as man's felicity, Secured by cancelling the Serpent's curse. III A little pearl, as fables tell us, erst Down in the bosom of “the vasty deep” Unnoticed lay for many an age immers'd, And shed a pearly tear, (for pearls could weep When trees and flowers with beasts and birds convers'd, As, whilom in my youth, I've heard rehears'd,) To think so long it should neglected sleep. IV By change, like many on this earth, we know Which folly can set up, and virtue down, Abase the highest, and exalt the low, And o'er a monarch elevate a crown; The meanest to magnificence may grow, The humble acorn to an oak, and so That pearl arose to decorate a crown. V So, lowly Christian, who, small space gone by, Was plunged in black despondency and care, Weigh'd down by sin, small hope of rescue by, Pardon'd—that pardon lost, and worse despair The terrible result,—now ranking high As champion of the cross, for which to die Elects him to a crown of glory heir! VI Yet, though in heart elate when forth he went, (A heart more gentle, corslet ne'er did hide,) Glittering in arms, but still on peace intent, And all he might with honour, to abide, Sooner than discord sow or discontent, Or raise an arm on strife or slaughter bent, Unless by foeman to his God defied. VII And much did it behove him so to feel: Tho' difficulty he had left behind, The vale below, to him (though cased in steel) Was fraught with peril of superior kind, And one to arms admitting small appeal; Humiliation set on all her seal Who, there descending, were to danger blind. VIII To guard him much as in their province lay, Discretion, link'd with Prudence, went before, And Piety, too, brought him on his way, With Charity, herself of good a store; 'Twas by their Lord's divine commandment they, Who at the palace had beguil'd his stay, His parting lighten'd with of kindness more. IX And, ere they reach'd the bottom of that hill, Discretion taught him less to seek than shun Dissension; Prudence how to meet each ill; And Piety, save God, to trust to none! While Charity, with swimming eye, yet still By smiles accompanied, inclined his will All foes to pardon when in fight he won. X Some parting token for her sake to bear Each offer'd ere she left: Discretion gave The glass of foresight to prevent much care In tracing out his road; while Prudence grave A purse presented with advice to spare; Fair Piety, a book of precious pray'r In golden text, with illustration brave. XI And Charity, as if of good ashamed, A mantle gave, (wishing her deeds unknown,) She form'd to hide, so wonderfully framed, Deformity in others as our own; And in that cloak a treasure, but not named For Christian, and for all his aid who claim'd, His gifts to whom would many a sin atone. XII And never felt that Pilgrim so alone As when those maidens left him in the vale: Methought a tear, which fain he would disown, Roll'd down his manly cheek, and told a tale Of thoughts gone back to home! Much dearer grown From dangers disbeliev'd, or scarcely known, By those dear friends they might too soon assail! XIII But little time had he for grief, I wot, For, as his downcast eye he rais'd again, He wist not what he saw, for it was not “A gentle knyghte came pricking o'er the plain,” Fiendlike in form, and with defiance hot, While Christian seem'd all spell-bound to the spot, As Jehu, like his foe, came on amain! XIV Ye veterans in war, who when but young, Felt and remember, in your maiden fight, Something in nerves approaching to “unstrung,” As your first enemy came close in sight— Ye will not blame the hero we have sung, Whose foe appear'd a nondescript, which tongue Could never yet describe, or paint aright. XV The arms of your opponents you admired, Their banners designated whence they came, Their gallant bearing emulation fired, You fear'd not, but applauded—little blame To Christian, if, when foeman strange, attired As his appear'd, some moments it required To warm his courage with religion's flame. XVI A human outline, dark and undefined, With mouth of lion, issuing wreaths of flame, And scales like fell Leviathan—no kind Of animal resembled him; his name Apollyon! dragon's pinions were assign'd His shapeless shoulders; feet that seem'd inclined To imitate a bear's—and on he came! XVII In either hand he brandish'd darts of fire, Which ever and anon he whirl'd around, Or toss'd above his head with hell-born ire, As if he meant the pilgrim to astound. But Christian nor advanced, nor would retire, Until the enemy, with threatenings dire, Sprang to his prey with one infuriate bound. XVIII That awful moment in the balance weigh'd, Seem'd Christian's fate—resolv'd at first to try The fight, he faulter'd, till reflection stay'd Such want of resolution—should he fly, His back, with steel unguarded, were betray'd To the fiend's archery; himself, too, made A victim to his imbecility. XIX His wav'ring eye, now glancing o'er his shield, Beheld a powerful word thereon engraved, 'Twas faith, by which, when just about to yield, The nearly sinking Christian soul was saved. His fears had from the fiend been ill conceal'd, Who, in a voice which scorn and hate reveal'd, And look disdainful, spoke, or rather raved: XX “Whence com'st thou, caitiff? whither dost thou speed?” To whom the Pilgrim, reassured, replied, “The city of Destruction, in my need “Of pardon for past sins, I left, and tried “To find a path to Zion, where, indeed, “I hope to rest; and, should that hope succeed, “Earth's empire would I with no soul divide.” XXI “The city of Destruction owns my sway, “I am its sovereign prince, Apollyon said, “And thou my subject, and a traitor! say, “Hast thou of punishment condign no dread, “Thou who hast dared without our grant, to stray, “Detected renegade! retrace thy way, “Or by my diadem I strike thee dead!” XXII Quoth Christian, “In your dangerous domain “That I was born, I cannot well deny, “Too long the slave of thy despotic reign, “I here renounce it, Fiend, and utterly! “Thy wages are but death, thy favour, bane, “The antidote to which I've found, and vain “Wouldst thou again my lost allegiance buy.” XXIII “Nay, since 'tis interest sways thee,” with a sneer Of bitterest contempt, the demon cried, “No price to save a subject were too dear, “Thou shalt command my treasures—on my side “Rank kings, and powers, and conquerors, nor fear “Thou with the highest shalt command, if here “Thou to my throne wilt swear to be allied.” XXIV “That I'm another's soldier thou mayst see “By these my arms, nor million-fold the worth “Of all thy wealth would make me faithless be!” The warrior elect retorted.—“Earth,” Rejoin'd the Fiend, “Holds not a thing by me, “Double deserter! so despised as thee, “And thou shalt curse the hour that gave thee birth.” XXV “Not in his service,” Christian boldly said, “My lot in thine I'd cause to curse, but”—“Hold!” “The Prince of Darkness bellow'd, “Hast forgot “How oft thy second master thou hast sold? “Desponding, sleeping, boasting, didst thou not “Disgrace the very arms thou now hast got, “When me, thy proper lord, with fear thou didst behold?” XXVI “All this,” said Christian, “is too true, but I “Am on my master's bus'ness, take good care “How you impede his officer, for high “And sacred is the character I bear.” Apollyon answer'd, “In thine office die! “Thy going hence with life, no living eye “Shall see, by my infernal den, I swear! XXVII With maniac rage a fire-tipp'd dart he threw, Which Christian's shield flung back on him who aim'd Its mischief; then his sword the Pilgrim drew, Which, as across the Monster's sight it flamed, Stagger'd his sense, as when all Israel blew Their trumpets, crash'd their lamps, and Midian knew ‘The sword of heav'n and Gideon,’ victory claimed. XXVIII Like sinners flying in conviction's face, The son of Belial to the charge came back, His darts flew thick as hail, and not a place In Christian's armour that some mark did lack Of their fell force, which deeply one might trace For ages after; (wounds are no disgrace:) Yet dear the Fiend abided each attack. XXIX Thrice 'twas the struggling Pilgrim's lot to feel, As the fierce fight was pictured in my dream, The biting keenness of his foeman's steel; In head, hand, foot, meaning, as it should seem, (I speak but what my vision did reveal, And but to its instruction can appeal,) His understanding, converse, faith, I deem. XXX The day half spent, and Christian nearly too, (So long, methought, the contest was maintain'd, While neither yet the other could subdue,) While each satanic nerve Apollyon strain'd, His darts expended, and impetuous threw The Pilgrim on the earth, nor much to do For his destruction now, I wist, remain'd. XXXI Then with fell grasp poor Christian's throat he press'd, Who, desperate, firmly grasp'd his shortened blade, And ardently, in mental pray'r, address'd The power by whom alone are conquerors made; 'Twas brief and needfully, howe'er exprest, For the fierce foe no time allow'd to rest, And still less chance appeared of mortal aid. XXXII Exulting o'er his victim in the dust, Apollyon paus'd, with horrible delight, When Christian, with one sudden deadly thrust, Changed, instant, the complexion of the fight; And, as he dealt the blow, “thus ever must “They conquer,” he exclaim'd, “in God who trust, “As they must fall who hold his mercies light?” XXXIII The Fiend, astounded, stagger'd, and had fled; But, as like lightning he pursued his blow, “Rejoice not over me,” the Pilgrim said, “For when I fall I shall arise!” and lo! His dazzling steel whirl'd round Apollyon's head, Who in dismay his bat-like pinions spread, And, howling, sped to the abodes of woe. XXXIV “Nay then,” pleas'd Christian cried, “in all these things “We're more than conquerors, through him whose love “Protect us!” and his praise the Pilgrim sings, Who “sought,” is “found,” and will for ever prove His seeker's refuge; who from evil brings Good, and, from whose assistance, slaves and kings Have equal privilege in pray'r to move. XXXV And then a hand appear'd, like that of yore, The Persian's fate that pencill'd on the wall— Leaves, gather'd from the tree of life, it bore, The Pilgrim's wounds to heal; nor was this all Of wonder, for, seraphic, as before The minstrel corps celestial sung once more In angel triumph o'er a Dæmon's fall! XXXVI While Christian, who, by Charity's kind care, With wine restorative had been supplied, And rich confections, nutritive and rare, To present need the welcome stores applied; But first craved blessing in right thankful pray'r, And (while he humbly doth his laurels bear) The choristers of Zion thus replied: XXXVII “Thy pray'rs have been heard, and thy valour recorded, “The battle is ne'er to the strongest decreed; “Like thee, who confide, will as sure be rewarded, “As foes of Jehovah to fall are decreed. XXXVIII “The race to the swift is not always conceded, “But he who in weakness asks strength from above, “Will find that the cause of the lowly is pleaded, “And won by a Saviour whose essence is love. XXXIX “Thy shield, the shield of faith, hath saved thee, “When foes of him who loves thee braved thee; “When pow'rs of darkness had enslaved thee, “But in thy Master's sight, “The darts of evil boldly facing, “Thy proud profession not disgracing, “Thy trust on him who made thee placing, “Thou'rt victor in the fight! “Thus thy pray'rs have been heard, and thy valour recorded, “The battle is not to the strongest decreed; “And, like thee, who confides will as sure be rewarded, “As foes of Jehovah to fall are decreed!” END OF CANTO IV. CANTO V. THE ARGUMENT. Triumphant, while new triumphs he obtains, To darker scenes the onward Pilgrim hies: The Valley of Death's shadow, where there reigns “Darkness that's felt,” and fire that never dies. A brother Pilgrim's company he gains, Whose crown of martyrdom dissolves those chains Which keep true Christians from their native skies. I 'Twere vain to wish for better poet's pens, But “better poets,” was a lapse,—I'd say 'Twere vain to wish for what is other men's,— I mean the talent Terror to pourtray, As Milton or as Dante, the dire dens Of Pandemonium, or the pitchy fens Of Erebus, which they so well display. II The road to Heav'n from Earth, we're but too sure, Is thorny, full of ravines, pits, and snares, Where, hoping much, much more we must endure, Ere reap the wheat among so many tares; Censured when rich, or haply crush'd if poor, “Another, and a better world,” the cure, And only cure for wayworn pilgrims' cares. III Seeking that better world, our Pilgrim's pace He quicken'd, on his setting once more forth; Pleas'd, void of pride, his sword without disgrace He'd drawn, and proved his armour's genuine worth; Anxious to shun, yet fearing not to face New dangers, he began his nerves to brace 'Gainst any chances which from time have birth. IV Then, as Mistrust and Timorous before Essay'd to turn him from his proper way, With agitation pale, two cowards more Cross'd him, as though his progress they would stay; And, speech when they could find, at every pore Exuding abject terror, they implore Of Christian to return, while yet he may. V He ask'd “The danger?” “There! beyond the heath, “Unseen, no mortal would believe the tale, “A fearful hollow lies—the Vale of Death! “Where witchcraft, flames, and sorcery prevail: “Serpents infect the air with poison'd breath, “Fiends fly above, and scorpions crawl beneath, “And sulph'rous heat is mix'd with scalding hail! VI “And fire-eyed dragons in that noisome dell, “And victims, bound in burning chains, abide, “Whose every respiration is a yell “Of such despair as would even God deride; “While the hoarse clanging of a ceaseless knell, “Which calls all inmates to their native hell, “Distracts the ear, and ev'ry sense beside!” VII To whom thus Christian: “Should the way indeed “Prove all your fears describe, I hold it still “(Or were it worse) my duty to proceed, “And, by protecting help of Heav'n I will!” “Take thy way, fool!” they answer'd, “'tis decreed “That thou must perish, and wilt vainly plead “For grace, when thou of peril hast thy fill.” VIII The Pilgrim drew his sword, and firmly bent His footsteps to the path denounced, and then Discover'd (whatsoe'er was their intent,) Much reason for the caution of those men; And soon at every step, though on he went, Felt much inclined his rashness to repent, And, like his tempters, to return again. IX The devious path was rugged; on each side Methought a deep and filthy ditch was seen, Error and Sin their names. Each surface wide Was thickly mantled with deceptive green; Most wretched he whoe'er such surface tried, 'Mid shoals mephitic, destined to abide With snakes, efts, newts, and reptiles most obscene! X And, half way through this melancholy dell, Where ev'ry soil was sown with horrors new, Wide gaped, insatiable, the jaws of Hell! And danger upon danger darker grew: And sight and hearing, feeling, taste, and smell, So at each turn distress'd, no man could tell How he, with life, that valley might pass through. XI And flame, that gave no light, succeeded smoke; And lava sported round the Pilgrim's feet; As, tottering, he stepp'd. Dead silence (broke At intervals by shrieks, that sore did greet The ear,) prevail'd, or, haply, something spoke, Or seem'd to speak, blaspheming; or awoke Strange thoughts rebellious, and for man unmeet. XII That sword so formidable, lately felt By fierce Apollyon, caus'd nor fear nor care, Circled by Hell as it had been a belt, Christian no weapon found avail but prayer; 'Mid fires, might boldest resolution melt, And fears and fancies so profusely dealt, That all a morbid mind e'er magnified seem'd there. XIII Legions of sheeted ghosts pass'd gibbering by, Hydras, and hooded serpents hissing flew Close to his vision, or appear'd so nigh That, even arm'd with pray'r, he backward drew! And one dread vampyre, with terrific eye, And threatening arm, seem'd Heav'n to defy With laughter, echoed by the spectral crew. XIV Then Christian lifted up his voice, and loud, (As one whom some new impulse did inspire,) Pronounced that Name to which we all have bow'd; And instant saw Hell's denizens retire: No longer of their transient triumph proud With groans terrific the satanic crowd Plunged, self-impell'd, in lakes of liquid fire! XV “In the Lord's strength I'll walk!” the Pilgrim sang, As light seem'd dawning o'er the fading scene, When, suddenly, the space before him rang With accents welcome to his ear, I ween, So late polluted with discordant clang Of chains, and cries, and curses from the gang Of that sad region he but now had seen. XVI And, still at distance, did they seem to fly, And faintly flicker in the lambent flame, While forms and fires retiring seem'd to die, As heav'n's bright beams with soft gradation came In blushing tints, that warm'd the morning sky; Then with what rapture did the Pilgrim's eye Contrast them with the glare of Sin and Shame! XVII Again the voice before him (so methought) Sang loud and cheerful as the matin bird, And Christian with delight those accents caught, His heart responsive to the strains he heard: “Through Death's dark valley, by thy precepts taught, “I walk rejoicing, unsubdued by aught, “Supported ever by thy saving word!” XVIII Now Christian's voice, as well as feelings, tried To answer his precursor, and this lay, Which memory from sacred text supplied, Greeted the beauteous birth of opening day! “The shades of death he hath with morning's pride “Replaced, and shadows which his power defied, “Have changed to beams that light me on my way!” XIX “His radiant day-star shineth o'er my head,” (Job's gratitude the prototype supplies,) “And through the murky veil of darkness spread, “His wisdom proves a lantern to mine eyes!” The former voice the thankful theme that led Was silent, and the Pilgrim left to “thread The thicket,” he approach'd in lonely wise. XX That thicket's inlet, to the startled view, Disclosed a cave, near which in sad display The mangled forms of men, whom giants two (Now little dreaded) once had slaughter'd, lay; Pagan and Pope the miscreants were—but few Their influence now own, and those who do, Few converts find their doctrines to obey. XXI Of these, one at the cave's mouth Christian saw, But, all depress'd with age, he helpless lay; Incapable to those to give the law Who deem'd infallible a thing of clay; The Pilgrim passing safe, beheld him gnaw His nails for spite, with paralytic jaw, And heedless of each menace, went his way. XXII A hill surmounted, from its height his view Encounter'd, but a little way before, The singer he had listen'd to, and who, Like Christian, burthen'd with offences sore, Had ask'd, as he did, what were best to do; And, freed from sin, his course did now pursue Toward that home where grief exists no more! XXIII Christian a townsman saw in him, of old, Who in his own predicament was placed; Faithful by name and second nature, bold In the good cause, so eager in his haste, That when desired to stop, he Christian told, He in a race for Heav'n had been enroll'd, Nor dare he one important moment waste. XXIV In emulation of his honest zeal Methought that Christian tried to overtake And pass his brother pilgrim, when his heel Entangled in an intervening brake, Threw him a fall, and much he seem'd to feel That check, as to his conscience an appeal 'Gainst sinful striving for Vain Glory's sake. XXV And Faithful, (as all brother pilgrims should,) To “raise up them that fall,” assistance gave, And now they march'd together, and 'twas good To hear them with expression warm, but grave, Exchange experiences, for either could Tell of temptations conquering, or withstood, Thro' His assistance who but came to save. XXVI Faithful, like Christian, had in Law put trust, And Wanton, with her wiles had him assail'd, And Faithful fell, as fall all mortals must; And much that wicked lapse had he bewail'd: Old Adam he at length put off, as dust His works accounting; till among the just Admitted by new birth when Grace prevail'd. XXVII Now, while in converse kind, it chanced, they pass'd One Talkative, who boasted much and long Of his regeneration, and so fast He spoke whole volumes about right and wrong, All in the mould of affectation cast, That, tired, they left his rapid tongue at last To other list'ners to repeat its song. XXVIII Yet not so happily had they been quit Of such associate, but while talking, he Beheld Evangelist approach. Unfit For such companion conscious he must be, He by retreat evinced unusual wit; Meantime, with features by true pleasure lit, Their welcome friend the joyful pilgrims see. XXIX With cordial salutation did they greet: And, after much of kind enquiry made, Evangelist prepared their minds to meet More than of peril they had yet essay'd; For, sacrificed to perjury, deceit, And hate of wicked men, imprison'd, beat To death, they one or both would be betray'd. XXX Exhorting them in future trials, then, To think whose soldiers and whose servants they Had been appointed; and to play the men, And testimony for the truth display; And joys beyond all sublunary ken, Imagination, Painting, power of pen, Would crown their zeal in God's last judgment-day. XXXI A city near at hand would prove the scene, He said, of their oppression; and its name Was Vanity, where all delights terrene Of riches, rank, prosperity, and fame, Were bought and sold; and where a fair had been For ages held—all nations there were seen, And princes, peers, and poor adventurers came. XXXII Ere the kind sage departed, at their pray'r His counsels he repeated, and when gone, The Pilgrims cherish'd the proud hope to bear The cross and crown of martyrdom, each one Aspired to be selected—at the fair They soon arrived, and what they saw when there Included all by which weak hearts are won. XXXIII Their strange apparel and their sober speech Astonish'd many, and offended more. When ask'd, what would they buy? they answer'd each, “We buy the truth:”—a thing ne'er heard before In that proud city, where they only teach To cheat, to cozen, and to overreach, As they do, will do, and did heretofore. XXXIV “Strangers, and not in fashion!” furnish'd cause To constitute a difference, and those Who could not by discussion gain applause, Instead of argument appeal'd to blows. For, causing in their merriment a pause, The pilgrims were arrested, and the laws Twisted to meet the wishes of their foes. XXXV Examined, oft remanded, and, in fine, Committed for high treason 'gainst the fair; A jury pack'd, the pilgrims they consign To trial, where all miscreants who could swear That right was wrong, or black was white, combine; Judge frowning, jury nodding; and, in fine, The verdict, guilty! as some verdicts are. XXXVI And instant execution was decreed On Faithful first, because he had denied That city's lord to worship—Christian, freed For present policy, though much he tried, With truths unanswer'd, for his friend to plead— Offer'd his life, and earnestly indeed Wish'd to save Faithful, he, instead, had died. XXXVII Without one instant's respite, to the stake Faithful was dragg'd, what tortures he sustain'd Here we attempt not to describe, for sake Of hearts that by such blazon would be pain'd; Suffice to say, whate'er a heart might break Of insult, or to agony could wake The frame, was by their cruel laws ordain'd. XXXVIII Nought could their fell malignity exceed, Unless their victim's constancy to bear Their torments, and with firmness intercede For his fierce enemies in parting prayer; And when at every pore he seem'd to bleed, And, flame-encircled, could no longer plead, Then seem'd the heavens his triumph to declare. XXXIX A car, too dazzling for a waking eye, Did in my dream with majesty descend, And, as Elijah erst was call'd on high, So did an host of seraphim attend The conqueror Faithful: Christian, with a sigh, And arms extended, seem'd as he would try To catch the mantle of his martyr'd friend. XL If heretofore, the music of the spheres Accompanied each pageant I beheld, How indescribably to earthly ears The present burst of joy my awe impell'd: So vast, so overpow'ring yet appears Its memory, that but for timely tears 'Twould burst the bosom its expression swells. XLI No mortal words can picture what my dream Of song presented; softly now it roll'd Like zephyrs o'er Æolian strings; then bold As lately pent-up thunder, did it seem. And, could I tell the theme, 'twould thus be told: ÆRIAL CHORUS. “He rises, the victim of fortune and death, “The army of martyrs a martyr attend, “A prayer for his foes graced his agonized breath “When dying, who rises to life without end!” END OF CANTO V. CANTO VI. THE ARGUMENT. Christian, from far, beholds the heav'nly rest, Where long his wishes and his heart had lain; Yet ere attain'd, that home for the distrest, His wanderings more correction must sustain, 'Till Error conquer'd, and Despair supprest, And Death subdued, his place among the blest We see, at length, the happy Pilgrim gain! I That Christian should a death so dire behold As that which Faithful firmly underwent, Was but anticipation, he was told, Of pangs more cruel for his portion meant; But threats of death, or promises of gold, He scorn'd, who neither would be bought or sold, And, for his faith, to suffer was content. II And Faithful's firmness in his trying hour Had countless converts to religion made; Of whom too many, by the hand of power, Where Christian languish'd, were in durance laid: Of these, one Hopeful, from that dismal tower Escap'd foes “seeking whom they might devour,” And Christian, too, found freedom through his aid. III Like Paul and Silas, hand in hand they went, As with light step the city gates they pass'd; And great, I scarce need say, was their content When that land's barriers they o'erstepp'd at last; But most was Christian happy—with intent To cheer his path it seem'd as tho' Heav'n sent, In Faithful's stead, a friend as firm and fast! IV There wanted not (with such the world o'erflows) Seductive tongues to turn their steps aside: By-ends from Fair-speech city, one of those Who pious seem for profit, vainly tried, Tho' hot and cold with the same breath he blows,) And Demas a whole mine of silver shows,— But Christian bribes and flattery defied. V To yield to Demas, Hopeful felt inclined, But Christian kept him from so great default; That ill averted, in their path they find A female, figured in a rock of salt! Lot's Wife! Now sorrowing Hopeful call'd to mind He'd have gone back, not look'd—the friendship kind That saved him, ne'er could he too high exalt! VI Now by a river broad their progress lay, Which by Saint John was named of life the stream; And on its banks they journey'd many a day, Where fruits to grow spontaneously did seem; Fruits that preserv'd from sickness and decay, And free to all who pass'd that pleasant way: Too pleasant to be match'd but in a dream! VII Sad were the Pilgrims when that pathway ceas'd, For soon the road unequal grew, and dry As Arab deserts, as the heat increas'd, With no oasis to relieve the eye; Until a shadowy lane, a very feast To sunburnt traveller, or wayworn beast, They gladly saw, as in my dream did I. VIII “To By-path Meadow” did a board direct, And Christian blithely would that route essay, But Hopeful, in his turn, would fain protect His friend from wand'ring from the King's highway: Wisely his own fault did he recollect, Foreboding by-ways might be incorrect, And tempt them into dangers dark to stray. IX But Christian pointed out, that side by side With the straight road it went, or seem'd to go, And then a man before them they espied, Vain Confidence his name, and sought to know From him if safely might that path be tried. “'Tis the best road,” the traveller replied, “To prove it, I'll precede, the way to show.” X Forward he went; they followed: brief the space Of time 'ere darkness, like a withering cloud, Obscured all objects: nothing could they trace, Save when blue lightnings glared on tall trees bow'd By gusts terrific; and their leader's face Grew pale with dread of peril and disgrace, 'Till headlong falling, shriek'd the wretch aloud! XI A pitfall had receiv'd the treacherous guide: Vain Confidence was now no more! and Truth Began o'er Christian's senses to preside, Who own'd his error to the trembling youth He had persuaded, in the fancied pride Of eldership, with him to turn aside: And dreadful was the consequence, in sooth! XII In vain they struggled to regain the track By which they left a rough but safer ground; But “Gradus revocare,” to go back Was not so easy as to err, they found: Daylight and courage now they both did lack, And fear'd all nameless ills that might attack, From beast or bandit prowling there around. XIII And thrice, or more, did they attempt, in vain, To find the boundary so madly crost: The roaring waters drove them back again, And nearly, like their guide, had they been lost; Till worn with fear, anxiety, and pain, Fruitless alike to struggle or complain, Sleep, overpow'ring, seiz'd them, to their cost! XIV Now near that spot, for such a dwelling fit, A hideous Giant's castellated den Frown'd o'er the landscape drear; where snare or pit Were in each path to catch unthinking men, Who, like our pilgrims, had so little wit As a safe road's security to quit For mire, morass, and fog, and filthy fen! XV The Giant of that castle was Despair, (Grandson of Discontent, Sin's favorite child, Wedded to Diffidence, allied to Care,) Who ever murmur'd, and who never smiled; And forth he every morning did repair His man-traps to inspect, if haply there Some victim to his toils might be beguil'd. XVI But, though he never smiled, a ghastly grin His fearful face made more ferocious still, Whene'er a captive, caught in net or gin, His deep-dug dungeons might be doom'd to fill; And when he found our pilgrims slept within His web, thus arrogant, did he begin To triumph o'er the game he meant to kill. XVII “Awake! half-witted wanderers, arise! “Full dearly for this trespass shall ye pay, “To Doubting Castle's lord no common prize, “Despair shall revel in your hearts to-day!” Then drove them forward, with reproachful cries, Distorted mouth, and rage-inflated eyes, A brutal joy delighting to display! XVIII He urged them on, till in his castle's keep, Where neither light nor comfort he bestows, Plung'd by despair in cavern dark and deep, With water stagnant, blackest bread, and blows; And when subdued by cruelty to weep, Despair advised them they in endless sleep Should seek oblivion of their cureless woes. XIX This counsel, oft repeated, undermined By slow degrees, first Christian, then his friend; Hopeful, though last to own it, felt inclined By self-destruction self-caus'd cares to end; The Giant's helpmate, Diffidence, combined With her dark lord, Despair, each captive mind To suicide, Hell's blackest crime, to bend. XX Celestial mercy! attribute most fair Of Him whose goodness lends thy ray on earth, To gild the black recesses of Despair, And from his banishment to Hope give birth; Thine influence was felt by Christian, where Inhumed within the lowest pit of Care, His woes were made the sport of wreckless mirth! XXI And Hopeful, sinking, heard a sudden cry From Christian, crazed with joy who seem'd to be; “Fool that I am! imprison'd thus to lie, “When I the means possess of being free! “The key of promise in my reach doth lie “Forgotten!—Thrice ungrateful wretch, that I “Should thus neglect such mercy shewn to me!” XXII Yet Hopeful deem'd his comrade did but mock. “Not so,” quoth Christian, since 'tis Heav'n's decree: “In Doubting Castle there is not a lock “The key of promise will not open: See!” This said, their fetters first he loos'd, the block That form'd their dungeon-door of solid rock, Next,—all the rest obey'd that wond'rous key! XXIII Despair was lull'd to sleep while forth they sped With breathings quick, but noiseless; yet their fate Hung on a hair. The Giant left his bed And follow'd furiously, but too late. So swift for life the panting pilgrims fled, They reach'd the spot from whence they were misled, And who shall then describe their bliss how great? XXIV To Him who hears the sinner from the deep, Their gratitude they pour, and then erect A warning there, that none again may sleep, Or quit the bounds which the right way protect; That fell Despair no future souls should keep In darkness, anguish, and dismay to weep Their erring idly from the road direct. XXV With haste, that did permit no looks behind, And hearts which ev'ry grateful feeling thrills, The pilgrim pair ascend where shepherds kind Cancell'd the memory of by-gone ills: Those mountains, call'd Delectable, remind Christian of Charity, and Sisters kind, Who from their house-top shew'd those lofty hills. XXVI Knowledge, Experience, Watchful, and Sincere, The shepherd chiefs were named, and they, methought, From lofty hills their future road made clear, And gave such lessons, as the pilgrims taught To be upon the watch, and, (not severe, But just by way of hint, they) made appear The spot where Christian and his friend were caught. XXVII To crown the prospect, far and far away, Appear'd the city where the just abide; Bright, and far brighter than the solar ray, More dazzling than all dreams of earthly pride; And, dreadfully opposed, a devious way Bedeck'd with ev'ry flowret sweet and gay, Led to Hell's postern on a mountain's side. XXVIII The shepherds gave them of the road a plan, With this advice engraved thereon around: “Avoid all flatterers, and let each man “Beware of sleeping on enchanted ground;” The Pilgrims seem'd each other's thoughts to scan, When they replied, “A risk we lately ran, “Insures we ne'er shall be so heedless found.” XXIX Among the crosses by our Pilgrims met, On leaving the good shepherds, there was one, (A stumbling-block, which has been, and is yet, To the best meaning who life's race may run;) 'Twas Ignorance, his mind bound in a net, Despising all of knowledge he might get, Proud of possessing little more than none! XXX He came not by the first gate, but had pass'd Through broken fences, which, when he was told Would bar his hoped-for entrance at the last, Gave great offence; and he, in accent bold, “Regretted with such fools his lot was cast, “And wonder'd people's tongues should run so fast, On one who for such schooling was too old!” XXXI “Besides,” quoth he, “I pay each man his own, “Tythes, and church-dues, give alms, and fast, and pray; “Nor e'er with others' business was known “To make or meddle—therefore, my own way “I chuse, and all unask'd advice disown; “Follow your systems, and let mine alone!” And off he tripp'd, most lamentably gay. XXXII In bonds Apostacy they next behold, By seven devils borne to that hill-side, Where lately, by the shepherds they were told, A postern-gate of hell might be descried; And, further, though forewarn'd not to be sold To flatterers, they once more, as of old, Were caught by one, their weakness who espied. XXXIII A white-rob'd demon, with mask'd face, was he, Who, with soft words, which hardest heart did hide, When ask'd if Zion-ward that road might be? Dazzled their sense, and turn'd their steps aside. O man! that in experience' spite, we see, So hourly blinded; when wilt thou be free From Satan's spells, by which thou art so tied? XXXIV With fascination dire he led them where By nets they were entangled; then, in tone Of deep derision, laughing, left them there, Helpless, to mourn and moralize alone, In dread and terror, lest the fiend Despair, Again should seize them; when a form as fair As Fancy's brightest outline on them shone. XXXV Frail as Arachne's web, their bondage fell On either side, and now their friend sincere Scarce had dissolv'd the sable flatterer's spell, Which, but for him, had haply cost them dear, When, with a scourge they merited full well, (“He chasteneth whom he loveth,” Scriptures tell,) Their fault he visited with arm severe. XXXVI With new instruction (and reproof, that they The shepherd's guide-book had so soon forgot, And all their other cautions, yet could stray, And hazard for a smile their future lot;) He set them right again—eventful day Of mercy! let no verse presume to say, How oft accorded when man heeds it not? XXXVII In speechless gratitude they pass'd along, When,—on the “heavenly city” turning back, They met with Atheist, told him he was wrong, But he, who all belief in Truth did lack, Scoff'd at their doctrine as a gone-by song, Opposing light with obstinacy strong, And left them, other pilgrims to attack. XXXVIII At length they enter'd that enchanted field, Of which the shepherds bade them take good heed, For, should they to its magic influence yield, Soft, stealing, sleep their progress would impede; And finally their doom might then be seal'd; But pious converse they, by way of shield, Sustained, which saved them in no common need. XXXIX Victorious from that trial, now anew They forward press, and from a lovely vale, The “land of Beulah” call'd, their 'raptured view Beholds their promised home! no fears assail Their happy minds, their dearest hopes proved true, Forgotten ev'ry sorrow late gone through, Transporting certainties of Heaven prevail! XL Dazzling, and every step more dazzling still, The glorious, indescribable abode So soon to be their own, the Pilgrims fill With happiness scarce hoped for on their road; And “shining” inmates from that heav'nly hill Announce that, by their Royal Master's will, Their “great reward” will there be soon bestow'd. XLI A rapid river, sombre, wide, and deep, Between them and their long-hoped haven lay, Through which, if firmly they their footing keep, The depths of darkness lead to endless day. That river was call'd “Death;” and friends might weep For those who struggle with eternal sleep, Yet wake to joy,—what joy no tongue can say. XLII The theme too powerful for description grows,— Each by the other comforted, they pass'd The final trial, and my dream must close, Where op'ning Heav'n receives the pair at last. Earth's inspiration the most daring, knows Not even a thought to point at bliss which those Enjoy, whose blessed lot is in that region cast. XLIII The wife of Christian, and her children four, In Heaven's good time convinced, like him, that grace Alone can save, with earnestness implore Their intercessor, and with zeal embrace The Pilgrim's life, until they reach'd the shore Of the black stream, which pass'd, they meet once more, Illumed by glory from a Saviour's face. XLIV And now those choristers who ceaseless raise Before the throne of Him, the First and Last, The Alpha and Omega! songs of praise For blessings present, and to come, and past, With energy immortal to each string Of million millions harps and psaltries sing, In celebration of each sinner saved, And mercies that on hearts should be engraved. XLV Were Niagara's thunder sweet as loud, Or both combined, a whisper would they prove To all conjecture what that choral crowd Sung, in my dream, of mercy, truth, and love! FINIS.</field>
