      <field name="fulltext">A PROPHESIE VVRITTEN LONG SINCE FOR THIS YEARE, 1641. I doe not wonder, as I erst have done, That when the Prophet Ionas should have gone To Niniveh, Gods word he disobey'd, And would himselfe to Tharsus, have convey'd: For, I have now a sense how flesh and blood The motions of the Holy Ghost withstood, And feele (me thinks) how many a likely doubt The Devill, and his frailty, found him out. He was a man, (though he a Prophet were) In whom no little weaknesse did appeare: And, thus he thought, perchance, What shall J doe? A strange attempt my heart is urged to: And, there is somewhat, earnestly incites That I should hasten to the Ninivites, And, preach, that if they alter not their waies, Their time of standing, be but forty dayes. My soule perswadeth God injoynes me to it; And, sleepe in peace, I cannot, till I doe it: But common Reason striveth to restraine This motion, and perswadeth me tis vaine. It saith, I am a sinner, and so fraile, That many times, my best endeavors faile To rectifie my selfe, How shall I then: Be hopefull of reclaiming other men? To [illeg.] J have threatned many yeares Gods judgements: yet, no fruit thereof appeares Although they have some knowledge of the Lord, And are within his League, they slight his word: What hope then is there, that a heathen Nation Will prove regardfull of my exhortation? The stile of Prophet, in this land I carry; And such a Calling, here, is ordinary But, in a forraigne State, what warranty Have I, to publish such a Prophesie How may the King and people take the same, If I shall in the open streets defame So great a City? and, condemne for sin, A place wherin I never yet have bin? Jf I shall say, the Lord commanded me, Then, they phehaps, will answer: What is he? For, they professe him not. Nay, some suspition They may conceive, that I to move sedition Am sent among them. Or, if otherwise They shall suppose; how can they but despise My person, and my counsell, who shall from So farre a place, so meere a stranger come, That no man knowes, or what, or who I am, Or, from what Country, or from whom I came? Such thought (belike) delay'd and fear'd him so; And, so the Spirit urg'd him still to go For Niniveh; that nor to goe, nor stay, Could he resolve; but, fled another way. From which rebellious course, God fetceth him back With such a vengeance, that he did not lack Sufficient proofes, how Reason did betray him, And, in his Calling, causlesly affray him, Yea (marke heav'ns providence) though Ionas went Another way, it crost not God's intent, But furthered it. For, doubtlesse, ere he came To Ninveh, the miracle and fame Of his Deliverance, was sent before; And, made his preaching worke on them the more. Now, though I doe not arrogate, nor dare My selfe (except in frailties) to compare With blessed Jonas: yet I may behold To say, our Causes a resemblance hold. My heart (and when that moves, as one averres, It more prevailes then many Counsellers, My heart (I say) perswaded me e're while, To reade a warning Lecture to this Ile. And in such manner moved; that, to say It came from God, me thinks, behold I may. Yet, my owne nat'rall frailty, and the world, Among my thoughts so many doubtings hurld, That every step had rubs. I levell'd some In my last Canto. Yet, I could not come To even ground, till I had overtopt Some other Mountaines which my passage stopt, Beware said Reason, how thou undertake This hazardous adventure, which to make Thou hast resolv'd For, this wise age denies That God vouchsafed any Prophesies Concerning them; or, that the application Of ought foretold, pertaineth to this Nation. She saith, my Constancy is no true signe That God first moved this intent of mine; Since Hereticks, and Traytors, oft are seene As bold in all their causes to have beene As Martyrs be. And, that for what they doe, They can pretend the holy Spirit too. And she perswades, tis likely I shall passe (At best) for one that much deluded was. She sayes, moreover, that if these times be Indeed, so wicked, as they seeme to me, I shall in stead of moving to repent, Nought else but stir their fury, and be rent Perhaps in pieces, by their hasty rage, For, what's more likely in a wicked age? When people in their sins grow hardned once, She saies I may as well goe talke to stones, As tell them ought. For, they are in the dark; And, what they see and heare, they doe not marke. She urged that the Prophets in old times Did speake in vaine against the peoples crimes; And if in them their words begat no faith, Much lesse, will such as mine, my Reason saith. She tells me also, that this Ile hath store Of Prophets, and of Preachers never more: She sayes, that though their calling none neglect, Their paines appeare to take but small effect: And, if such men authorized as they, Doe cast their words, without successe, away; In vaine my Muse (whose warrant most contemne) Doth seeke to worke more piety in them. A thousand things unto the like effect; Yea, all and more then any can object, (Who shall peruse this Book) my Reason brought Before me, and objected to my thought, And, as a Pilgrim (who occasions hath To take some extraordinary path) Arrivall making at a double way, Is doubtfull whether to proceed or stay: So fared I; I was nigh tired quite, Before I could be certaine of the right. Yea, twixt my doubtings, and all those replies Which in my meditations did arise; I so amazed grew, I could not know Which way it best befitted me to goe: But, at the last, God brought me thorow all My doubts and feares; as though the Storme and Whale, Once Jonas came: That so all they, who are Ordained for their good, these lines to heare, The more may profit, when they think upon What straights I passed, e're this work was done. To that intent my frailties I have so Insisted on, as in this book I do. Yea, I am hopefull also, they that read These lines of mine (and mark with how much heed And Christian awfulnesse, my heart was won To censure and reprove as I have done) Will plainely see, these Numbers flow not from Fantastick rashnesse; nor from enuy come, Nor spring from faction; neither were begot By their distracted zeale, who (knowing not What Spirit guides them) often are beguiled With shewes of truth; and madly have reviled Both good and ill: and whose unsavory Rimes Defames mens persons more then check their crimes. Dishonour Kings; their sacred names blaspheme; And having gain'd some notions in a dreame, Or by report (of what they know not well) Desire their giddy thoughts abroad to tell: In hope to merit; as in deed they doe, Sometime the pillory, and gallowes too. I trust, I say, these lines will seeme no such; Or, if they doe, truth is, I care not much, Because I certaine am what pow'r infused Those matters whereupon I now have muzed: And know, that none will these or me condemne, But they whose rage and follies I contemne. Yet, that they may be sure I never care Who censures me, nor what their censures are, (When honest things I doe) here, some what more I'le adde to what is mentioned before, And give thee; Britaine, a more perfect sight Of thy distempers, and thy sickly plight. Yea, thou shalt know, I have not seene alone A bodily Consumption stealing on, And wasting of thy Temporalties; but, that I also have discovered of late, A Lethargy upon thy soule to steale And that as well the Church as Commonweale Doth neede a cure. Oh! doe not [illeg.] neglect, The good of both; but; one (at least) respect. Though Iudahs sicknesses unheeded be, (Although thy temporall wounds afflict not thee,) Yet looke on Syon: yea, behold and see, Thy Spiritualties how much impair'd they be. The Churches Patrimony is decay'd, And many a one is in her spoiles [illeg.] Those Patrons (as we terme them in this age) Who of her Downes have the patronage, Doe rob and cheat her, many times of all; And, their Donations basely set to [illeg.] Those Cananites whom thou preservest here, (And by thy lawes to be expelled were) Are in thy borders now so multiply'd, That they are thornes and thistles in thy side: They are become a Serpin in thy path, Which bites unseene; and [illeg.] unhorsed hath. Some able Riders. On thy Places-high Thy people doe commit Idolatry, And reare strange Altars. In thy Fields are found Those cunning harmefull Foxes to abound, That spoile thy Vines. And, some I have espy'd, Twixt whose opposed tales, are firebrands ty'd, Which wasts thy fruits. Thy Harvest seemeth faire; But secret blastings doe so much impaire And blite the Corne; that when it comes to bread, Thy Children oft unholsomly are fed, Men use Religion as a stalking-horse, To catch preferment; yea, sometimes to worse And baser uses they employ the same; Like that bold Harlot, who quite void of shame, Did of her Vowes, and of her Peace-offerings make A Ginn, lascivious customers to take Yea, some (resembling him, from whom was cast One Devill) when one sin thy have displac't, Of which the world tooke notice, sweep and clense Themselves (in-show) from all their other sins; Yet secretly, let Sathan repossesse, And foule them with a seven-fold wickednesse. An universall dulnesse will benum Thy senses, if thou doe not soone becom More heedefull of thy state, then thou art yet: For, ev'ry part hath felt an ague-fit. Thy Academs, which are the famous places In which all pious knowledges and graces Should nourisht be, and whence thy chiefe supply Of Teachers, come, (as from a Nursery) Ev'n those faire Fountaines are much tainted grown, With doctrine hardly sound, which thence are blown Through ev'ry quarter. In their Schooles are heard Vaine jiggs and janglings, worthlesse of regard. Their very Pulpits, and their Oratories, Are Stages, whereupon their owne vainglories Men often act, Yea, many a vaine conceit, Is brought instead of argumets of weight And (which worse) disorder is so rife Among them; and the weedes of evill life Have so o'regrowne those Gardens, than (unlesse Good government shall speedily redresse That spreading mischiefe) it will overtop That plants of Syon, and destroy her crop. To be thy Shepheards, wolves and stolen in; And thou hast chose who even by day begin To sow their Tares among thy purest Seed; And, with mixt [illeg.] thy Lands pollutions breed. For hire, and money, prophesies the Prophet: The Priest doth preach to make a living of it Ev'n meerely for a living; and, but sow Their holy charge, for conscience sake pursue Which I by many signes, could make apparent, But that it is not yet within my Warrant. Loquntur Curæ leves; little Cures Doe make then preach, whilst poverty endures. Ingentes stupent; but, large livings make Our Doctors dumb, condemne not thy mistake For, though I doe the Latine sentence wrong, That's true I tell you in the English tongue. Our Nation, which of late prophanesse hated, Is in that sin almost I[illeg.]onated. The Scriptures without reverence are used: The holy phrase in jesting, is abused: To flout, or praise, or curse, we can apply Gods holy word, most irreligiously: Instead of Emblemes, moving thoughts divine, The filthy pictures of lewd Ar[illeg.]ine, Are found in many Closets. Foolish lies, Prophane and most lascivious Elegies. Are publike made. Yea, those whom heretofore A heathen Emperour did so abhor, That he, for them their wanton Author sent To undergoe perpetuall banishment Ev'n these, we reade and worse then those, by far, Allowed passe, and unreproved are. Nay, their vaine Authors often cherisht be: At least, they have the favour to goe free. But, if a graver Muse reprove their sin, Lord, with what [illeg.]sty zeale they vail it in! How ibellous they make [illeg.] and how vile, Thou know'st; and at that folly those dost smile. Full warily the politick Divine, (Who should allow it) scanneth ev'ry Line Before it passe; each phrase he doth suspect; Although he findeth nothing to the checkt, He feares to Lice[illeg.]. And if by chance It passe abroad, forthwith doth ignorance Mistake or misapply; and false and bade Constructions are of good expressions made: Yea, they who on the seats of Iudgement sit, Are oft, most ready to miscensure it. I would they were as forward to disgrace Those Authors, who have filled ev'ry place With fruitlesse volumes. For dispersed are Ev'n quite throughout this Land every yeare, Ev'n many thousand Reames of scurril toyes. Songs, Rimes and Ballads, whose vaine [illeg.] destroyes Or hinders Uertuous knowledge and Devotion, And this they doe to further the promotion Of our Diana. Yet, behold, if we To publish some few sheets required be, Containing pious Hymns, or Christian Songs. Or ought which to the praise of God belongs: We do so feare the hindrance of our gaine, That like th'Ephesian Silver-smiths, we faine A great complaint. As if to have enlarged A little Booke, had grievously o'recharged The Common wealth Whereas if it were weigh'd, How much of late this Land is overlaid With triviall Volumee ore how much they doe Corrupt our Manners, and Religion too; By that abusive matter they containe? I should not seem unjustly to complaine. These times doe, swa?mp? me with Pamphlets, which be far More dangerous, then mortall poysons are. Ev'n in those bookes, whereby the simple thought To find true knowledge, they their b?a?ne have caught For, thence, strong Heresie (there being hid Amid some doubtless Truths, while unspi'd) Steale out among the people by degrees; More mischiefe working then each Reader sees: And, so, to ruine knowledge, that is made For (by their lucre, who the Churches peace Disturb, their pirvate profit to increase) Those Doctrines which are un[illeg.]horifed, Are so promiscuously, divulg'd and spread, Among approved Verities, tha some Are in those Laberinths amaz'd become: And, such a contradiction is in that Which their confused, Pamphlete doe relate: That, common Readers, known of which to leave, Nor, which the Church of England doth receive. And, from this mischiefe many others ?f?low, Which will, in future times, more harmful grow. This spins vaine Controversies to their length; By this, most Heresies receive their strength. And what distraction it already makes, Our grieved Mother wofull notice takes. Instead of active knowledge, and her fruit; This filleth men with itching of dispute, And empty words; wherby are set abroach A thousand quarrells, to the Truths reproach, The Sectaries the Munkeyes, and the Apes, The Cubs and Foxes, which doe mar our Grapes; The Wolves in sheep-skins and our frantick rable Of VVorship-mongers, are innumerable, And, as the Churches quiet they molest So they each other spightfully infest, We have some Papist, some that halfe way goe Some Semi-puritans; some wholly so; Some Arabaptists, some who doe refuse Black puddings; and good porke like arrant Iewes; Some also term'd Arminians are among Our Priests and People very lately sprung. What most so call'd, professe, I stand not for: And whant some say they teach, I doe abhor But, what some other, so misnam'd beleeve, Is that whereto best Christians credit give, For, as we see the most reformed man, By Libertines, is term'd a Puritan: So (by our purblinde Formalist) all those Who new fantasticke crutchets doe oppose, Begin to be mis-term'd Arminians now, And, hence e're long will greater mischieves grow Then most imagine. For, the foolish feare Lest they to be Arminians may appeare, Or else be termed Puritans, will make Great multitudes Religion quite fosake And, I am halfe perswaded, this will one, Of tose great Schismos (or earthquakes) cause which John Foretold in his Apocalyps, and they Are blest, who shall nor thereby fall away. Some Brownists, and some F[illeg.]lists hove we; And some, that no man can tell what they be; Nor they themselves. Some seeme so wondrous pure They no mans conversations can endure, Vnlesse they use their plaistrings, and appeare In ev'ry formall garbe which they shall were. There be of those, who in their words deny And hate the practice of Idolatry, Yet make an Idol of ther formall zeale, And underneath strict holinesse, conceale A mystery of evill, which deceives them, And, when they thinke all safe, in danger leaves them. Their whole Religion, some doe place in hearing Some in the outward action of forbearing Ill deedes; or in well doing, though the heart In that performance beare no reall part. Some others, of their mortall actions make Small conscience: and, a [illeg.] that God doth take No notize how in body they transgresse, If him in their inward man confesse: As if a soule beloved could reside Within a body quite in sanctifide. Some not contented in the act of sin. Aare growne so impudent, that they begin To joustisie themselves in wickednesse; Or, by [illeg.]uat arguments, to make it lesse: The Christian liberty defamed is. Newfanglednesse, Religion hath o'rethrowne; And, many as fantasticall are growne In that, as in apparell. Some delight In nothing more the to be opposite To other men: Their zeale they wholy spend The present government to reprehend: The Churches discipline to villifie; And raile, at all, which pleades antiquitie. They love not peace: and therefore have suspition Of Truth it selfe, if out of persecution: And so thankelesse, or so heedlesse be Of Gods great love, in giving such a free And plenteous meanes of pulishing his word. That, what his Prophets of the Iewes record, Some verefie in us. Much praise is given To that blinde age, wherein the Queene of Heav'n Was worship heare. And falsely we extoll, Those dayes, as being much more plentifull. Some, at the frequency of Preaching grutch. And, tyred with it, thicke we have too much: Nay, impudently practise to suppresse That Exercise, and make our plenty lesse, And, that their doing may not want some fayre Or goodly coulor, they doe call for Pray'r, In stead thereof; as if we could not pray, Vntill our Preaching we had sent away. As these are foolishly, or lewdly, wise; We have some others wontonly precise. So waywardly disps'd, amidst our plenty, And through their curiousity, so dainty, That, very many cannot well digest The Bread of life, but in their manner drest. Nor will Gods Manna, or that measure serve, Which he provides; But, they cry out they starve, Vnlesse they seed upon their owne opinions, (Which are like Egypts Garlike and her Onions) Some like not Prayer that extempory: Some not any that set forme noth cary: Some thinke there's no devotion, but in those That howle, or whine, or snuffle in the nose; As if that God vouchsafed all his Graces For fained gestures, or for soure faces. Some thinke not that the man; who gravely teacheth; Or hath a sober gesture when he preacheth, Or gentle voyce: hath any zeale in him, And therefore, such like Preachers they contemne. Yea, they suppose that no mans doctrine saves The soule of any one, unlesse he rayes, And rores aloud, and flings, and hurleth so As if his armes he quite away would throw; Or over-leap the Pulpit; or else breake it: And this (if their opinion true may make it) Is to advance their voyces Trumpet-like, As God commands: yea, this (they say) doth strike Sinne dead. Whereas indeed, God seldome goes In whirlewinds: but is in the voyce of those Who speake in meeknesse. And it is not in The pow'r of noyse to shake the walls of sinne: For clamors, antique actions, writhed lookes And such like mimmick Rhetoricke none brookes That hath discretion: neither doth it move The heart of any, when we so reprove; Excpt it be in some contrary motion, Which interupts the hearts good devotion. The well affected Christian pitties it; It makes prophanest men at naught to set Gods Ordinance. Meere morall men despise Such affaection: much it terrifies The ignorant: but very few from thence Receive sound knowledge, or true penitence. Some relish nothing, but those points that are In controversie: some would nothing heare But songs of Mercy; some delight in none But Songs of Thunder; and scarce any one; Is pleas'd in what he heares. Nay of their Preachers, Mechanicks, arrogate to be the teachers. Yea, most of us, what e're our Pastor shyes, Keepe still our owne opinions and our wayes. To heare and know Gods word, to some among Our Nation, seemeth onely to belong To Clergymen; and, their implicite Faith Is built on what the common rumour saith. Some others fill'd with curiosity Affirme that ev'ry sev'rall mystery Within Gods Booke included, doth concrne Ev'n each particular Christian man to learne: Whereas they might as well affirme, each guest That is invited to each Feast, Is bound the sev'rall dishes thereto heed, And upon every meat before him feed, Nay, some have almost this imagination, That there is hardly hope of their salvation Who speake not Hebrew. And, this now adayes, Makes foolish women, and young Prentises To learne that holy Tongue; in which they grow As cunning as doe those who nothing know, Save to be arrogant, and to contemne Those Pastors, who have taken charge of them. The appetite of some growes dull, and failes, Vnlesse it may be pampered with Quailes; High flying crotchets, which we see doe fill Not halfe so many soules as they doe kill. We cannot be content to make our flights, For that which God exposeth to our sights, And search for that which he is pleas'd to show, But, we must also pry, what God doth know. Which was indeed an ancient fallacy Of Sathans; and the very same whereby He cheared Eave. From seeking to disclose Beyond our warrant, what God onely knowes, Proceedeth many errors. Thence doth come Most questions that have troubled Christendome. Yea, searching things conceal'd, hath overthrowne The comfortable use of what is knowne. Hence flowes their fruitlesse fond asseveration, Who blundred on Eternall-Reprobation, And many groundlesse whimsies have invented, Whereby much better musings are prevented. Of Reprobation I no doubt have made; Yet, those vaine quarrelings which we have had, Concerning her, and her antiquity, (But that the world hath wiser tooles then I) Appeares to me to bring so little fruits, That I suppose it fitter for disputes In hell, (among the reprobrated crue) Then for for a Church of Christians to pursue: At least to brawle about with such hot rage, As hath possest some Spirits of this age. For, some have urg'd this point of Reprobation, As if the chiefest groun-worke of salvation Depended on beleeving, just, as they (Deluded by their fancies) please to say. And, though they never found Gods holy word Did any mention of the same offord, But, as of that which did begin since Time; And with respect to some committed crime: They, neverthelesse, their strengths together guther, To prove the Child is older then the Father. And, since that fatall thred, there, finds her spinning, But from Of; at farthest from Beginning: They Reprobation, otherwhile confound With our Predestination: which is found No where in all the Scripture, to respect The Reprobates, but onely Gods Elect. And then they are compeld to prove the sense. Of their darke Tenet, by an inference; And to affirme (from reason) that Election Eternall, doth infer the like rejection. (As if an action of Eternity, Were fit to square out shallow reasons, by) Which Argument because it hath not taken True Faith, to ground on, may with ease be shaken. Their tottering structure, therefore, up to keepe, They into Gods foreknowledge boldly peep, Beyond his warrant; searching for Decrees And secrets, farther then an Angell sees: Presuming then, as if all things they knew, And had Eternitie within their view. But, that hath such an infinite extension, Beyond their narrow-bounded comprehension, That, there, they wander on, till they are madd: And loose that little knowledge, which they had: For what are they but mad-men who maintaine The giddie fancies of their owne weake braine, For Theses of Religion, which we must Beleeve as they affirme them, or be thrust Among the Reprobates? What lesse, I pray, Are they then madd, who foole their wits away In wheeling Arguments which have no end? In Straines which man shall never apprehend? In seeking what their knowledge doth exceed? In vaine disputings, which contentions breed. In strange Chymera's, and fantastick notions, That neither stirre us up to good devotions, Nor mend our manners? But our wayes pervert, Distract the Judgement, or puffe up the heart. If this I may not madnesse call, or folly, Tis (at the best) religious-melancholly. What shall we judge of those who strive to make Gods Word (whose Termes and Scope they much mistake Their proofes for that whereof no proofes they are, And sleight those Truths, for which the Text is clear: What shall we deeme of those, who quite mistaking Good Authors, (and their Volumes guiltie making Of what they never meant) doe preach and write Against those Bookes, with rancorous despight, Which being well examin'd, say the same Which they affirme, and check what they doe blame. Such men there be, and they great noise have made By fighting furiously with their owne shade. What may be thought of them, who likely, ever, In their perverse opinions to persever, Take knowledge up on trust: and follow those Who leade them on, as wild-geese fly in rowes? And when their multitude is waxen great, Doe then so wilfully prejudicate, Become so confident of that they hold, And in their blind assurance, so are bold, That they can brook no tryall, neither see Their oversights, how plaine so ere they be? But fondly think (though we beleeve it not) That they infallibitie have got? Some pious men; yea, some great Doctors tread, Such Laborinths; and often are misled By holding that which they at first were taught, Without due proving all things as they ought; And vulgar men are often led awry, By their examples, and for company. For, as a Traveller, that is to come From some far Countrey, through large desarts home; (Not knowing well the way) is glad to take His course with such who showes of cunning make, And walkes along, depending still on them, Through many a wood, and over many a streame, Till he and they are lost: there to remaine He finds no safetie, nor meanes back againe, Nor list to leave his company; because He hopes that nearer homeward still he drawes, And that his guides full sure of passage are, Although they cannot well describe it, there. So, when plaine men doe first attempt the way Of knowledge, by their guides, they walk astray, Without distrust: and when arriv'd they be Where many troublesome windings they doe see, And where no certaintie they can behold, Yet, on their leaders knowledge they are bold, Or on their multitude: yea, though they know, And, see them erre, and turne, and stagger so, (In darksome paths) that well suppose they may, They rove and wander in an uncouth way; Yet, still they are unwilling to suspect The wisdome of the Fathers of their Sect. Yea, though no satisfaction they can find, Though feares and doubtings doe afflict their mind, They still impute it rather to their owne Infirmities, or to the depths unknowne Of those mysterious points, to mention brought; But never call in question what is taught: Lest being by those Teachers terrifide, They might forsaken in despaire abide. Their Doctors, also, failing to devise Strong Arguments, their hearers to suffice; This course, to salve their credits, late have got; They say (forsooth) Faiths doctrine settles not With naturall capacities; and that The Spirit must those men illuminate Who shall receive them. And, indeede in this, They doe both say the truth, and say amisse: This is a Jesuitish juggling trick, And, if allow'd it be, each lunatick, And ev'ry brain sick Dreamer, by that way, May foist upon us all that he can say. For, though Gods holy Spirit must create New hearts within us, and regenerate Depraved nature, e're it can be able To make our outward hearings profitable; We must not thinke that all which fancy saith (In termes obscure) are mysteries of Faith. Nor make the hearers want of pow'r to reach Their meanings, to be proofes of what they teach. There is twixt men; and that which they are taught, Some naturall proportion, or tis naught. The deepest mystery of our profession, Is capable of literall expression, As well to Reprobates, as men elected; Or else it may of error be suspected. Yea wicked men a power granted have To understand, although they misconceive. And can of darkest points make plaine relations, Though to themselves they faile in applications. God never yet did bid us take in hand To publish that which none can understand: Much lesse affecteth he a man should mutter Rude sounds of that, whose depth he cannot utter; Or in uncertaine termes, as many doe, Who preach Non-sense, and oft non entia too. For those which man to man is bound to show, Are such plaine Truths, as we by word may know; Which when the hearer can expresse againe, The fruit hath equalled the Teachers paine. Then, though the soule doth many times conceive (By Faith, and by that Word which we receive) Deep mysteries, and that which farre transcends A carnall knowledge: though she apprehends Some glimmerings of those Objects, that are higher Then humane Reason ever shall aspire; Though she hath tastings of that blessednes, Which mortall tongue could never yet expresse; And though the soule may have some earnest given On earth, of what it shall enjoy in heaven; Though God may when he list (and now and then For cause not ordinary) to some men Vouchsafeth (for their secret satisfactions) A few reflections from eternall actions: Though this be so, let no man arrogate That he such secrets can by word relate: For, they are things, of which no voyce can preach; High flights, to which no mortall wing can reach; Tis Gods owne worke, such raptures to convay, To compasse them there is no other way, But by his blessed Spirit. And, of those Most can we not; some must we not disclose. For, if they onely touch our private state, They were not sent, that we should them relate; But daigned that the soule they strengthen might Amid the perills of some secret fight; When men to honour God, or for their sinne, The terrours of this life are plunged in. And, as it is reputed of those things, Which foolish people thinke some Fairy brings, So, of Enthusiasmes speak I may; Discover them, and straight they fly away. For, thus they fare who boast of Revelations. Or of the certainty of their Salvations, Or any ghostly gift, at times or places, Which warrant not the mention of such graces: Yea, by revealing things which they should hide, They entrance make for over-weening pride: And that quite marres the blessing they possest, Or, for a while, obscureth it, at best: And yet, if any man shall climbe so high, That they attaine unto a Mystery, Conceiv'd by few; they may, if they be able, Disclose it where it may be profitable. But, they must know, that (if it be, indeed, Of such transcendency, as doth exceed Meere naturall reaches) it should be declard To none, save unto those who are prepar'd For such conceptions; and more apt to know them By their owne thoughts, then are our words to show them. Else, all they utter will in clouds appeare, And errors, men, for truths, away will beare. Would this had beene observ'd a little more, By some who in our Congregations roare Of Gods unknowne Decrees, Eternall-Callings, Of Perseverance, and of Finall Fallings, And such like Mysteries. Of else, I would That they their meanings better utter could, (If well they meant.) For, though those points afford Much comfort and instruction (as Gods word Hath mention'd them) and may applyed be, And opened, when we just occasion see; Yet, as most handle them, who now adayes Doe passe for Preachers, with a vulgar praise, They profit not: for, this ripe age hath young And forward wits, who by their fluent tongue, And able memories, a way have found To build a house, e're they have laid the ground. With common places, and with notes purloin'd, (Not well applyed, and as ill conjoyn'd) A garb of preaching these have soone attained, Which hath, with many, approbation gained Beyond their merit. For, they take in hand Those mysteries, they neither understand, Nor studied on. And, they have much distracted Some hearers, by their doctrines ill compacted: Yea, by enquiring out what God fore-sees, And medling much with his unknowne Decrees, The Churches peace so much disturb'd have they; So foule and crooked made Faiths plainest way; Such scandals rais'd; and interrupted so, By doubts impertinent, what men should doe; And, their endeavours nullifide, so far, That many of them at a nonplus are. I am not of their minds, who take from this And other things, that are perform'd amisse, Occasion to disparage frequent preaching; Or, to abate our plentiousnesse of teaching: For, of our Harvest, Lord, I humbly pray, The store of Labourers continue may. And, I could also wish, that none were chose To be a seed-man, till he truly knowes The Wheat from Tares; and is indu'd with reason, And grace, to sow in order, and in season. And that those artlesse workmen may be staid, Who build before foundations they have laid: Lest, when our Church well built, suppose we shall, It sink, and overwhelme us in the fall. It pities me to marke what rents appeare Within our Sion; and what daubings are To hide the ruines; and I feare the frame Will totter, if we long neglect the same. Our Watchmen, for the greater part, are growne Lesse mindfull of Gods honour, than their owne: For either almost wholly we omit That worke, or undiscreetly follow it. Some, speake the truth, without sincere intention, As they who preach the Gospell for contention. Some, by their wicked lives doe give offence, And harden men in their impenitence. As if nor hell nor heav'n they did beleeve, They ryot, game, drink drunk, and whore, and theeve, For avarice, and envy, none are worse; They are malicious, and blaspheme, and curse, As much as any others. None are more Regardlesse of the soule that's meane and poore; Among their neighbours, none more quarrelsome, Or, that more hardly reconcil'd become, Then many Clergie-men. And as we see They are the best of men, when good they be; So, there are none that wander more astray, When they have left a sanctified way. Some Pastors are too hot; and some too cold; And, very few the golden temper hold. Some, at the Papist with such madnesse fling, As if they could not utter any thing Of them too vile; though ne're so false it were: And, we so used by their Jesuits are. Some others at the Puritan doe strike, So furiously, that they are often like To wrong the Protestants: for, men impose That name, sometime, upon the best of those; Yea, they who are prophane, that name mis-lay On all who make a conscience of their way. Some Shepheards, on their Flocks are gorg'd at full, And sumptuously arayed in their wooll. But, those that are diseas'd, they make not strong; Their sickliest sheepe they seldome come among; They take no care, the broken up to bind, The Sheepe that's lost, they doe not seeke to find; They let such wander as will run astray; And, many times their fury so doth fray The tender conscience; that their indiscretion Doth fright their hearers headlong to perdition. Gods bounty hath large pastorage provided; But, they have not his flocks with wisdome guided: For, in the midst of plenty, some be ready To starve in ignorance. Some sheepe are treaddy; Some get the staggers; some the scab; and they Infect their fellowes. Some, the wantons play Among the thornes and bryers, which have torne The marks and fleeces, which they should have worn. Some straggle from the flock; and they are straight Surpriz'd by Wolves, which lye for them in wait. Some, sought large feeding, and ranck pastures got, Which prov'd not wholsome; &amp; they caught the Rot. For, many preach themselves, and fancies broach, That scandall preaching, to the Truths reproach. Yea, some terme that (forsooth) Gods word divine, Which would halfe shame me, should they terme it mine. And they we see, that longest pray and speake Are priz'd of most (though head nor foot they make) Because the common hearers of this Land, Think best of that, which least they understand. Some, also, by their feet disturb the Springs; Or trample and defile Gods pasturings; And they are either such who make obscure Faiths principles; or, such whose lives impure, Prophane their Doctrines. Other some have we, Who (like the beasts that over-gamesome be) Doe push their weaker brethren with their hornes; And hunt them from the flock, by wrongs, or scornes. Gods houses, also, much neglected are; And of his Sanctuaries, few have care. A barne, or any common house, or roome, Is thought as well Gods worship to become, As in the Churches infancy; or there, Where wants, and wars, and persecutions are. Amidst our peace and plenties, we doe grutch Our Oratories should be trimm'd as much As are our vulgar dwellings; and repine That exercises which are most divine, Should with more Rites, or Ornaments, be done, Then when the troublous times afforded none. As if a Garden, when the flow'rs are blowne, Were still to look as when it first was sowne. To worship so in spirit, we pretend That, in our bodies, we doe scarcely bend A leg, or move a cap, when there we be, Where Gods most holy Mysteries we see. Yea, many seeme so carefull to have bin, To let no Superstition enter in, That they have, almost, wholly banisht hence, All Decency, and pious Reverence. The Church, by Lukewarme Christians, is neglected, By brutish Athe'sts, it is disrespected; By greedy Worldlings, robbed of her fleeces; By selfe-will'd Schismaticks nigh torne in pieces; By Tyrants, and by Infidels opposed; By her blind Guides, to hazard oft exposed; By Hypocrites, injuriously defamed; And, by the frailties of the best, oft shamed. A pow'r ecclesiasticall is granted To them, full often, who those minds have wanted Becomming such Authoritie: and they Play fast and loose, ev'n with the Churches Key. They censure and absolve, as best shall make For their advantage; not for conscience sake. As they shall please, they punish or connive; And, by the peoples follies they doe thrive. Of evill customes, many are we see Insinuated, and so strict are we To keep them, that we sottishly deny To leave them, for what more would edifie: And we so much doe Innovations feare, That needfull Reformations none appeare. We have prophaned ev'ry holy thing; Ev'n our most Christian Feasts, which are to bring Gods Mercies to our thought; and memorize Of Saving-Grace, the sacred Mysteries: Some have ev'n those gain-sayed; and, in that Have evill spoken, of they know not what. Some others keep them; but, as heathenishly, As Feasts of Bacchus; and impietie Is then so rife, that God is rarely nam'd Or thought upon, except to be blasphem'd. By these, and other wayes, the Church doth lose Much honour, to the glory of her foes, And our great shame, and losse: for, her decayes Shall be this Realmes disprofit, and dispraise. God hath a Controversie with our Land; And, in an evill plight affaires doe stand. Already we doe smart for doing ill; Yet, us the hand of God afflicteth still, And many see it not; as many be So wilfull, that his hand they will not see. Some, plainly view the same, but nothing care: Some, at the sight thereof amazed are Like Balthazar; and have a trembling heart; Yet, will not from their vanities depart. About such matters, other some are loth Their thoughts to busie (meerely out of sloth) Like him, who rather would in hazard put His life, than rise from bed the doore to shut. Some, dreame that all things doe by chance succeed, And that I prate more of them than I need. But, Heav'n and Earth, to witnesse I invoke, That, causlesly, I nothing here have spoke. If this, oh sickly Hand, thou beleeve, And for thy great infirmitie shalt grieve, And, grieving of thy follies make confessions; And so confesse thine infinite transgressions: That thou amend those errors: God shall then Thy manifold distempers cure agen; Make all thy scarlet sins as white as snow, And cast his threatned judgement on thy foe. But, if thou (fondly thinking thou art well) Shalt sleight this Message, which my Muse doth tell, And scorne her counsell; If thou shalt not rue Thy former wayes; but, frowardly pursue Thy wilfull course: then, harke what I am bold, (In spight of all thy madnesse) to unfold. For, I will tell thy Fortune; which, when they That are unborne, shall read, another day; They will beleeve Gods mercy did infuse Thy Poets brest with a prophetick Muse. And know, that he this Author did prefer, To be from him, this Iles Remembrancer. If thou, I say, oh Britaine! shalt retaine Thy crying sinnes, thou dost presume in vaine, Of Gods protection. If thou stop thine eare, Or burne this Rowle, in which recorded are Thy just Inditements; it shall written be With new additions, deeply stampt on thee With such Characters, that no time shall race Their fatall image, from thy scarred face. Though haughtily thou dost thy selfe dispose: Because the Sea thy borders doth enclose. Although upon the Rocks thy neast is plac'd; Though thou among the Stars thy dwelling hast; Though thou encrease thy ships; and unto that Which is thine owne, with King Iehosaphat, Joyne Ahabs forces. Though thou watch and ward. And all thy Ports and Havens strongly guard; Although thou multiply thy inland forces, And muster up large troups of men and horses; Though like an Eagle, thou thy wings display'st, And (high thy selfe advancing) proudly say'st; I sit aloft, and am so high, that none Can fetch me from the place I rest upon. Yea, though thou no advantages didst want, Of which the glorioust Emperies did vaunt; Yet, sure, thou shalt be humbled and brought low; Ev'n then, perhaps, when least thou fear'st it so. Till thou repent, prouisions which are made For thy defence, or others to invade, Shall be in vaine; and still, the greater cost Thou shalt bestow, the honour that is lost Shall be the greater; and thy wasted strength, Be sick of a Consumption, at the length. Thy Treaties, which for peace or profit be, Shall nether peace, nor profit, bring to thee. Or, if thy Counsels prosper for a while, God will permit it, onely to beguile Thy foolishnesse; and tempt thee on, to run Some courses, that will bring his Judgements on. Yea, all thy winnings shall but fuell be, To feed those follies that now spring in thee; And make (with vengeance) those the more enrag'd Who shall for thy correction be engag'd. What ever threatned in Gods Book hath bin, Against a wicked people for their sin, Shall come on thee: His hand shall be for ill, On ev'ry Mountaine, and high-raised Hill. Thy loftie Cedars, and thy sturdy Oakes, Shall feele the fury of his thunder-stroakes. Upon thy ships, thy Havens, and thy Ports, Upon thy Armes, thy Armies, and thy Forts, Upon thy pleasures and commodities, Thy Crafts mechanick, and thy Merchandize; On all the fruits, and cattell in thy fields, On what the Ayre, or what the Water yeelds, On Prince and People; on both weak, and strong, On Priest, and Prophet; on both old, and yong; Yea, on each person, place, and ev'ry thing, The plague it hath deserved God shall bring. What ever thou dost hope, he frustrate shall; And, make what e're thou fearest, on thee fall. This pleasant soyle, wherein such plenty growes, And where both milke and honey overflowes, Shall for thy peoples wickednesse be made A Land as barren, as what never had Such plenties in it. God shall drive away Thy pleasant Fowles, and all those Fish that play Within thy waters; and for whose great store Some other Nations would have prais'd him more. Those Rivers, that have made thy Vallies rich, Shall be like streames of ever-burning Pitch. Thy dust, as Brimstone; fields as hard and dry As iron is, the Firmament, on high, (Like Brasse) shall yeeld thee neither raine nor due. The hope of wasted blessings to renue. A leannesse, shall thy fatnesse quite devoure; Thy Wheat shall in the place of wholsome flowre, Yeeld nought but bran. Instead of grasse and come, Thou shalt in times of harvest, reap the thorne, The thistle, and the bryar. Of their shadowes Thy Groves shall robbed be. Thy flowry Medowes Shall sterile waxe. There shall be seldome seene Sheep on thy Downes; or Shepheards on the greene. Thy walks, thy gardens, and each pleasant plot, Shall be as those where men inhabit not. Thy Villages, where goodly dwellings are, Shall stand as if they unfrequented were. Thy Cities, and thy Palaces, wherein Most neatnesse and magnificence hath bin, Shall heaps of rubbish be, and (as in those Demolisht Abbies, wherein Dawes, and Crowes, Now make their nests) the bramble, and the nettle, Shall in their halls, and parlours, root, and settle. Thy Princes houses, and thy wealthy Ports, Now fill'd with men of all degrees and sorts, Shall no inhabitants in them retaine, But some poore Fisherman, or Country Swaine, Who of thy glories, when the marks they see, Shall wonder what those mighty ruines be; As now they doe, who old foundations find, Of Townes and Cities, perisht out of mind. The places where much people meetings had, Shall vermine holes, and dens for beasts be made. Or walks for Sprighte, who from those uncouth ?ro?oms Shall fright the passenger, which that way comes. In stead of mirth and laughter, lamentation Shall there abide: and, loathsome desolation, In stead of company. Where once was heard Sweet melody, men shall be made afeard With hideous cryes, and howlings of despaire. Thy very Climate, and thy temp'rate ayre, Shall lose their wholsomnesse, for thy offences; And breed hot Fevers, Murraines, Pestilences, And all diseases. They that now are trained In ease, and with soft pleasures entertained; In stead of idle games, and wanton dances, Shall practise how to handle guns, and launces; And be compell'd to leave their friends embraces, To end their lives in divers uncouth places; Or else, thy face, with their owne bloud defile, In hope to keepe themselves, and thee, from spoile. Thy beautious Women (whose great pride is more Than theirs, whom Esay blamed heretofore) In stead of paintings, and of costly sents, Of glittering gems, and precious ornaments, Shall weare deformitie about their faces; And, being rob'd of all their tempting graces, Feele wants, diseases, and all such like things, Which to a wanton Lover lothing brings. Thy God, shall for thy overflowing vices, Scourge thee with Scorpions, Serpents, Cockatrices, And other such; whose tailes with stings are armed, That neither can be plucked forth, nor charmed. Thou shalt not be suffiz'd when thou art fed; Nor shalt thou suffer scarcitie of bread And temp'rall food alone; but, of that meat, Whereof the faithfull soule desires to eate. That curse of Ravenous beasts, which God hath said, Vpon a wicked kingdome shall be laid, He will inflict on the. For though there be No Tygers, Lyons, Wolves, or beares in thee, By beastly minded men (that shall be farre More cruell then those bloody spoylers are) Thou shalt be torne: for, each man shall assay His fellow to devoure as lawfull prey. In stead of Lyons, Tyrants thou shalt breed, Who nor of conscience, nor of Law take heed; But, on the weake mans portion lay their paw, And, make their Pleasures, to become their Law. In stead of Tigers, men of no compassion, A furious, and a wilfull generation, Shall fill thy borders. Theeves, and outlawes vile, Shall hunt the waies, and haunt the woods for spoyle, As Beares, and Wolves. A subtile cheating crew (That will with tricks and cousenages pursue The simpler sort) shall here encrease their breed; And, in their subtleties the Fox exceed. That hoggish herd, which alwaies rooting are Within the ground, and never upward reare Their grunting snouts; nor fixe their eyes on heav'n, To looke from whence their daily food is giv'n: Those filthy swinish livers, who desire To feede on draffe, and wallow in the mire: Those, who affect ranke pudles, more then springs; To trample and dispise most precious thing; The holy to prophane; Gods hearbs of grace To nouzle-up, his Vineyard to deface; And such like harmes to doe: these shall thy fields, Marre worse, then those wild Boares the desait yeelds. If thou remaine impenitent, thou art Like Egypt; and so stony is thy heart. For which obduratenesse, those plagues will all Descend on thee, which did on Egypt fall, Blood, Frogs, and Lice, great swarmes of uncoth Flies, Th'infectious Murraine, whereof Cattle dies; Boyles, Scabs, &amp; Blaines; fierce Haile, &amp; Thunder-stormes, The Locust, and all fruit devouring Wormes. Crosse Darknesse, and the Death of those that be Thy Darlings; all those Plagues shall fall on thee, According as the Letter doth imply, Or, as in mystick sense they signifie. Thy purest Rivers God shall turne to blood; With ev'ry Lake, that hath beene sweet and good. Ev'n in thy nostrils he shall make it stinke, For, nothing shall thy people eate or drinke, Vntill their owne, or others blood it cost; Or, put their lives in hazard to be lost. Most loathsome Frogs; that is, a race impure, Of base condition, and of birth obscure, (Ev'n in unwholsome fens, and ditches, bred) Shall with a clownish rudenesse over-spread Thy pleasant'st fields; thy fairest roomes possesse; And make unwholsome (by their sluttishnesse) Thy kneading troughs, thy ovens, and that meat, Whereof thy people, and thy Princes eat. This hatefull brood, shall climbe to croake and sing, Within in lodging chambers of the King. Yea, there make practice of those naturall notes, Which issue from their evill-sounding throats: To wit, vaine brags, revilings, ribaldries, Vile slanders, and unchristian blasphemies. The Land shall breed a nasty Generation, Vnworthy either of the reputation Or name of men. For, they as Lice shall feed Ev'n on the body whence they did proceed; Till poverty, and sloventy, and sloth, Have quite disgrac'd them, and consum'd them both. There shall, moreover, swarmes of divers Flies, Engendred be in thy prosperities, To be a plague: the Flesh-flye shall corrupt Thy savory meats; Musketoes interrupt The weary traveller; thou shalt have Drones, Dores, Hornets, Waspes, and such like angry-ones, Who represent that swarme whose buzzing tongues (Like stings) are used in their neighbours wrongs: And, still are flying, and still humming so, As if they meant some weighty worke to do, When as, upon the common stock they spend; And nought performe of that which they pretend. Thy Butter-flies shall plague thee too; ev'n those, Who waste their Lands and Rents, in gaudy clothes, Or idle flutterings; and then spawne their seed, Upon thy goodli'st flow'rs, and herbs to feed. As Beasts destroyed by the Murraine be, So, they they that are of beastly life in thee, By lewd example shall infect each other; And in their foule diseases rot together. On all thy people, or what sort soe're, Shall Scabs, and bile, and running sores appeare, The fruits of their corruption. Yea, with paines (Within their conscience, and with scars and blaines Of outward infamy) they shall be grieved. And, in their tortures perish, unrelieved. Tempestuos stormes, upon this Ile shall fall, Hot Thunder-bolts, and Haile-stones therewithall; Men either too too hot, or too too cold; Or else luke warme. But, few or none shall hold A rightfull temper: and, these meteors will Thy borders with a thousand mischieves fill. The Locust also and the Palmer wormes, Shall prey on what escapeth from the Stormes: Not they alone, which on the grasse do breed; But, also, they who from the pit proceed Which hath no bottom: and, when any thing Doth by the dew of heav'n begin to spring, They shall devoure the same, till they have left thee, Nor leafe nor blossome; but, of all bereft thee, Then shall a darknesse follow, farre more blacke, Then when the light coporeall thou dost lacke. For, grossest Jgnorance, o'reshadowing all, Shall in so thick a darknesse thee inthrall, That thou a blockish people shalt be made, Still wandring on in a deceiving shade; Mistrusting those that safest paths are showing, Most trusting them, who counsell thy undoing; And aye tormented be with doubts and feares, As one that outcries, in darke places heares. Nor shall the hand of God from thee returne, Till he hath also smote thine eldest-borne. That is, till he hath taken from the quite, Ev'n that whereon thou setst thy whole delight; And filled ev'ry house throughout this Nation, With deaths unlooked for, and lamentation. So great shall be thy ruine, and thy shame, That when the neighbour kingdomes heare the same Their eares shall tingle. And when that day comes, In which thy follies must receive their doomes; A day of clouds, a day of gloominesse, A day of blacke despaire, and heavinesse, It will appeare. And, then thy vanities, Thy gold, thy silver, thy confederacies, And all those reeds on which thou hast depended; Will faile thy trust, and leave thee unbefriended. Thy King, thy Priests &amp; Prophets, then shall mourne; And, peradventure, fainedly returne To beg of God to succour them: but, they Who will not harken to his voyce today, Shall cry unheeded: and he will despise Their vowes, their prayers, and their sacrifice: A sea of troubles, all thy hopes shall swallow: As waves on waves, so plague on plague shall follow: And, ev'ry thing that was a blessing to thee, Shall turne to be a curse, and helpe undoe thee. Thy Sov'raignes have to thee thy Fathers bin; By meanes of them hath peace beene kept within Thy sea-girt limits: they, thy weale befriended, The blessed Faith they stoutly have defended: And, thou hast cause of goodly hopes in him, Who hath, of late, put on thy Diadem. But know, that (till thou shalt repent) no part Belongs to thee of what is his desert His princely vertues, to his owne availe, Shall profit much: but they to thee shall faile. To thee his clemency shall seeme severe, His favours all, shall injuries appeare; And when thy sinne is fully ripe in thee, Thy Prince and people, then, alike shall be. Thou shalt have Babes to be thy Kings; or worse, Those Tyrants who by cruelty and force Shall take away thy ancient freedomes quite, From all their Subjects; yea themselves delight, In their vexations: and, all those that are Made slaves thereby, shall murther, yet not dare To stirre against them. By degeers they shall Deprive thee of thy patrimonies all; Compell thee (as in other Lands, this day) For thine owne meat, and thine owne drinke to pay. And, at the last beginne to exercise Upon thy sonnes, all heathnish tyrannies, As just Prerogatiues To these intents, Thy Nobles shall become their instruments. For they who had their birth from noble races, Shall (some and some) be brought into disgraces From offices they shall excluded stand: And all their vertuous off-spring, from the Land, Shall quite be worne: in stead of whom shall rise A brood advanced by impieties, By flattery, by purchase; and by that Which ev'ry truely-noble one doth hate. From stems obscure; and out of meane professions, They shall ascend and mount by their ambtions, To seats of Justice; and those Names to beare, Which honor'd most within these Kingdomes are. And being thither got, shall make more strong Their new-built Greatnesse, by encreasing wrong. To those, will some of these themselves unite; Who by their births to Lordly Stiles have right; But, viciously consuming their estate, Did from their fathers worths degenerate. By this Confederacy, their nobler bloods Shall countenance the others ill-got goods; The others wealth againe; shall keepe from scorne Their beggery, who have beene nobly borne: And, both together, being else unable, (In this ill-course to make their standing stable) Shall seeke how they more great, &amp; strong, may grow By compassing the publike over-throw. They shall abuse thy Kings, with tales, and lies; With seeming love, and servile flatteries. They shall perswade them they have pow'r to make Their Wils; their Law; and as they please to take There peoples goods, their children and their lives, Ev'n by their just and due Prerogatives. When thus much they have made them to beleeve, Then they shall teach them practices to grieve Their subjects by; and, instruments become To helpe the screwing up, by some and some, Of Monarchies to Tyrannies. They shall Abuse Religion, Honestie, and all. To compasse their designes. They shall devise Strange projects; and with impudence, and lyes, Proceed in setling them. They shall forget Those reverent usages, which doe befit The majestie of State; and raile, and storme, When they pretend disorders to reforme. In their high Counsels, and where men should have Kind admonitions, and reprovings grave, When they offend, they shall be threatned there, Or scoft, or taunted, though no cause appeare. It is unseemly for a Judge to sit And exercise a jibing Schoole-boyes wit Vpon their trades, or names, who stand before Their judgement seats: but who doth not abhor To heare it, when a Magistrate objects, Birth, poverty, or personall defects In an upbraiding wise? Or, who with me Derides it not, when in our Courts we see Those men, whose bodies are both old and weake, (Forgetting grave and usefull things to speake) Uent Giants words, and bristle up, as tho Their very breath could armies overthrow: Whereas (poore weaklings) were there in their places No more authority, then in their faces, Their persons, or their language, all their chasing, And threatning, nothing would effect but laughing. For unto me big looks, and crying hoh, As dreadfull seemes, as when a child cryes boh To fright his Nurse, yea such a bugbeare fashion Effecteth nought but scornefull indignation. But in those times (which nearer are then some Suppose perhaps) such Rhetoricke will come To be in use; and arguments of Reason, And just proceeding, will be out of season. Their wisedome shall be folly; and, goe nigh To bring conrempt on their Authority. Their Councell Table shall a snare be made, And those 'gainst whom they no just matter had, At first appearance shall be urg'd to say Some word or other, e're they part away, Which will betray their innocence to blame, And bring upon them detriment and shame: Yea, many times (as David hath of old, Concerning such oppressors well foretold) To humble crouchings, and to fained showes, Descend they shall, to worke mens overthrowes: And what their subtilty doth faile to gaine, They shall by rigour, and by force obtaine. What ever from thy people they can teare, Or borrow, they shall keep, as if it were A prize which had beene taken from the Foe: And they shall make no conscience what they doe To prejudice Posterity. For, they To gaine their lust, but for the present day, Shall with such love unto themselves endeavor, That (though they knew it would undoe for ever Their owne posterity) it shall not make Those Monsters any better course to take. Nay, God shall give them up for their offences, To such uncomely reprobated senses: And blinde them so, that (when the axe they see Ev'n hewing at the root of their owne tree. By their owne handy strokes) they shall not grieve For their approaching fall: no, nor beleeve Their fall approacheth; nor assume that heed Which might prevent it, till they fall indeed. Thy Princes, Brittaine, in those dayes, will be Like roaring Lyons, making prey of thee. God shall deliver thee into their hand. And they shall act their pleasure in the Land; As one his Prophet threatned to that Nation. Which doth exemplifie thy Desolation. Thy Kings (as thou hast wallowed in excesse) Shall take delight in drinke, and wantonnesse. And, those who thou dost call thy Noble-ones Shall to the very marrow, gnaw thy bones. Thy Lawyers fulfully shall wrest thy Lawes, And (to the ruine of the common Cause) Shall mis-interpret them, in hope of grace From those, who may dispoyle them of their place. Yea, that whereto they are obliged both By Conscience, by their Calling, and their Oath To put in execution, they shall feare, And, leave them helpelesse, who oppessed are. Thy Prelates in the spoyle of thee shall share; Thy Priests, as light shall be, as those that are The meanest persons. All their Prophecies, Or preachings, shall be herisies and lies. The word of truth in them shall not remaine, Their lips no wholsome knowledge shall retaine, And all his outward meanes of saving Grace, Thy God shall carry to another place. Marke well oh Britaine! what I now shall say, And doe not sleihhtly passe these words away; But, be assured that when God begins, To bring that vengeance on thee, for thy sinnes, Which hazzard will with totall over-throw, Thy Prophets, and thy Priests shall sliely sow The seeds of that dissention and sedition, Which time will ripen for thy sad perdition. Ev'n they, who formerly, were of thy peace The happy instruments, shall then increase Thy troubles most. And, ev'n as when the Iewes Gods truth-presaging Prophets did abuse, He suffered those who preached in his Name, Such falshoods as the chiefest cause became Of their destruction: so if thou go on To make a scorne (as thou hast often done) Of them who seeke thy welfare, he will send False Prophets, that shall bring thee to thine end, By saying all things thou wouldest have them say: And lulling thee asleepe in thine owne way. If any brain-sick Fellow, whom the Devill Seduceth to inflict on thee some evill, Shall coyne false Doctrines, or perswade thee to Some foolish course that will, at length, undoe The Common-weale, this counsell thou shalt follow; Thou, cover'd with his bait, a hooke shalt swallow To rend thine entrailes and thine ignorance Shall also for that mischiefe, him advance. But if that any love of thy weale, Inspir'd with truth, and with an honest zeale, Shall tell thee ought pertaining to thy good, His Messages shall stiffly be withstood: That Seer shall be charged not to see; His word shall sleighted as a potsherd be His life shall be traduced, to disgrace His Counsells; or, his errant to debase: Instead of recompence he shall be sure, Imprisonments, or threatnings to procure: And peradventure (as those Prophets were, Who did among the Iewish Peers declare Their States enormities) his good intention, May be so rong'd, that he, by some invention, May loose his life, with publike shame and hate, As one that is a troubler of the State. But not unlesse the Priest there to consent: For in those dayes shall few men innocent Be griev'd (through any quarter of the Land) In which thy Clergie shall not have some hand. If ever in the Fields (as God forbid) The blood of thine owne children shall be shed By civill discord, they shall blow the flame, That will become thy ruine, and thy shame. And thus it shall be kindled. When the times, Are nigh at worst; and thy increasing crimes Almost compleat; the Devill shall begin To bring strange crotchets, and opinons in Among thy Teachers, which will breede disunion, And interrupt the visible communion Of thy establisht Church. And, in the steed Of zealous Pastors, (who Gods flock did feed) There shall arise within thee, by degrees, A Clergie, that shall more desire to fleece, Then feede the flocke. A Clergy it shall be, Divided in it selfe: and they shall thee Divide among them, into sev'rall factions: which rend thee will, and fill thee with destructions: They all in ourward seeming shall pretend Gods glory, and to have one pious end: But, under colour of sincere devotion, Their study shall be temporall promotion; Which will among themselves strange quarrels make Wherein thy other children shall perrtake. As to the Persons, or the Cause, they stand Affected, even quite throughout the Land. One part of these will for preferment strive, By lifting up the King's prerogative Above it selfe. They shall perswade him to Much more then Law or Conscience bids him do; And say, God warrants it. His holy Lawes They shall pervert, to justifie their cause; And, impudently wrest, to prove their ends, What God, to better purposes, intends. They shall not blush to say, that ev'ry King, May doe like Solomon, in every thing, As if they had his warrant: and shall dare Ascribe to Monarches, rights that proper are To none but Christ; and mixt their flatteries, With no lesse grosse and wicked blasphemies, Then Heathens did: yea, make their Kings beleeve, That whosoever they oppresse or greive, It is no wrong; nor fit for men oppressed, To seeke by their owne Lawes to be redressed, Such councell shall thy Princes then provoke, To cast upon thee Rehoboams yoake. And, they not caring, or not taking heed How ill that ill-advised King did speed, Shall multiply thy causes of distraction. For, then, will of thy Priests, the other faction Bestir themselves. They will in outward showes, Those whom I last have mentioned, oppose. But, in thy ruine, they will both agree, As in one Center, though farre off they be In their Diameter. With lowly zeale, An envious pride they slily shall conceale: And, as the former to thy Kings will teach Meere Tyranny: so shall these other preach Rebellion to the people; and shall straine The word of God, Sedition to maintaine. They shall not feare to say, that if thy King Become a Tyrant, thou maist also fling Obedience off; or from his Crowne divorce him; Or, by the terror of drawne swords enforce him. Which false Divinity, shall to the Devill Send many soules, and bring on thee much evill. Oh! be thou therefore watchfull; and when e're These Lambs with Dragons voyces doe appeare, Repent thy sinne, or take it for a token, That some great Bulwarke of thy peace is broken, Which must be soone repaired; or else, all The greatnesse of thy glory, downe will fall. Take heede of those false prophets, who will strive Betwixt thy Prince and people to contrive A disagreement. And, what ever come, Thy due Allegeance never start thou from. For (their oppressions though we may withstand By pleading Lawes, or Customes) not a hand Must move against them, save the hand of God, Who makes a King, a Bulwarke, or a Rod, As pleaseth him. Oh! take ye therefore heed Yee People, and ye Kings (that shall succeed) Of these Impostors. Of the last beware Yee Subjects: for, their Doctrines hellish are. And though they promise Liberty and Peace, Your Thraldome, and your Troubles they'll increase. Shun oh! yee Kings the first; for, they advise What will your Crownes and honors prejudice. When you doe thinke their Prophecies befriend you, They doe but unto Ramoth-Gilead send you, Where you shall perish; and poore Micahs word, Though lesse esteem'd more safety will afford. They will abuse your piety, and all Your vertues. For their wicked ends they shall Apply the Sacred Story; or what ever May seeme to further their unjust endevor. Ev'n what the son of Hannah told the Iewes, Should be their scourge (because they did refuse The sov'raignty of God, and were so vaine To aske a King which over them might raigne As heathen Princes did) that curse they shall Affirme to be a Law Monarchicall Which God himselfe established to stand Throughout all ages, and in ev'ry land. Which is as good Divinity, as they Have also taught, who doe not blush to say That Kings may have both Wives and Concubines; And, by that Rule whereby these great Divines Shall prove their Tenet, I dare undertake (If sound it hold) that I like proofe will make Of any Iewish Custome, and devise Authority for all absurdities. But, false it is. For might all Kings at pleasure (As by the right of royaltie) make seasure Of any mans possessions: why i pray Did Ahab grieve, that Naboth said him nay? Why made he not this answer thereunto, (If what the Prophet said some Kings would do, Were justly to be done) Thy vineyards mine; And at my pleasure, Naboth, all that's thine Assume I may, like a Turky-chick, Did he so foolishly grow sullen-sick, And get possession by a wicked fact Of what might have beene his by royall act? If such Divinity, as this were true, The Queene should not have needed to pursue Poore Naboth, as she did; or, so contrive His death; since by the Kings Prerogative, She might have got his Vinyard. Nor would God Have scourg'd that murther with so keene a rod, On Ahab, had he asked but his due. For, he did neither plot, nor yet pursue The murther; nor (for ought that we can tell) Had knowledge of the deed of Iezabel, Till God reveal'd it by the Prophet to him, Nor is it said, that Naboth wrong did do him, Or disrespect; in that he did not yeeld, To sell, or give, or to exchange his Field. The Iewish Commonwealth did so instate, That, their possessions none could alienate, But for a time; who ever, for his mony, Or in exchange, desir'd their patrimony. And, doubtlesse, we offend, who at this day Those fredomes give, or lose, or sell away, Which were in common right possest of old, By our Forefathers; and, continue should To all their after commers. For, altho We may dispose of what pertaines unto Our persons: yet, those dues which former ages have left unto us for our heritages, (And whereunto, the child that borne must be, Hath ev'ry whit as good a right as we) Those dues we should preserve with all our might, By pleading of our just and ancient right, In humble wise; if so the Sov'raigne state Our freedome shall attempt to violate. But, when by peacefull meanes we cannot save it, We to the pleasure of the King must leave it, And unto God our Judge: for all the pow'r In us, consists in saying, This is our. A King is for a blessing, or a curse; And therefore (though a Foole he were, or worse, A Tyrant, or an Ethnick) no man may So much as in their private closets, pray Against his person; though they moy petition Against the wickednesse of his condition. Nor, is this suffrance due to those alone, Who subject are unto a Monarchs throne, But, from all those who either subjects are To mixed Government, or popular. For, though irregularities appeare In ev'ry State; because but men they are Whom Gods exalts to rule: yet, it is he By whom all Governments ordained be. And ev'ry Goverment (although the Name Be different) is in effect the same. In Monarchies, the Counsell (as it were An Aristocracy) one while doth beare The sway of all; and though they name the King, Yet, him they over-rule in ev'ry thing. Sometime againe, the pop'lar voice we see, Doth awe the Counsell, when in them there be Some pop'lar Spirits, Aristocracies Are other while the same with Monarchies, For, one great man among them gets the pow'r, From all the rest, and like an Emperor, Doth act his pleasure. And we know tis common To have some foolish Favorite, or Woman, To governe him. So in a pop'lar State, Affaires are manag'd by the selfe same fate; And either one or more, away doe steale The peoples hearts, and sway the Commonweale. Thus God is pleas'd, to humble and to raise: Thus, he by sev'rall names, and sev'rall waies, The world doth governe. Yea, thus, ev'n in one nation, And in one State, he makes much alteration In formes of Goverment; of changing that Which is but accidentall to a State. And, such his Iustice, and his Wisedome is, That he preserveth by the meanes of this, Those things which doe essentially pertaine To that great Power, which over all doth raigne. Nor is he pleased thus it should be done In States that meerely civill are alone; But, also, in the Churches governments, Allowes the change of outward accidents. Yea, they to whom he gives the oversights Of some particular Church, may change old Rites, The Customes, Formes, or Titles, as occasions Are offered them; or, as the Times, or Nations, Require a change: provided so, that they Take nothing which essentiall is, away; Nor adde what shall repugne or prejudice Gods Lawes, his Kingdome, or the Liberties Of them that are his people. For, in what Hath any Church a pow'r, if not in that Which is indifferent? Or, in what I pray Will men the Church authority obey, If not in such like things? Or, who should be The Iudge what is indifferent, if not she? A private Spirit knowes what best agrees With his owne fancy; but, the Church best sees, What fits the Congregation. From what gives Offence to one, another man receives Much comfort: and, his conscience edifies, By disciplines, which many doe despise. A Parish is a little Diocesse; And, as of Cities, Townes, and Villages, A Bishopricke consists: so, that doth rise By Tythings, Hamlets, and by Families. And little difference would be in the same, (Excepting in the largenesse and the name) If their opinions were allow'd of all, Who favour not the stile Episcopall: For, ev'ry Priest would then usurpe the same Authority, whereof some hate the name. Yea, many a one would then his Parish make A little Popedome, and upon him take (Considering his meane pow'r) as much as he That Universall Bishop claimes to be: And prove more proud, and troublesome, then they Against whose Lordlinesse they now inveigh. This therefore is my Rule; that Governement (What e're it be) in which to me God lent My birth and breeding; that, untill my end, I will obey, and to my pow'r defend. Yea, though it tyrannize, I will denay No more obedience, then by law I may: Ev'n by those Lawes and Customes which doe stand In force, and unrepealed in that land. What right another had, e're I was borne Or how, or for what sinne, Gods hand hath torne His Kingdome from him, I will never care; Let them goe answer that who Subjects were, (When lost it was) and had that meanes, and calling, And yeares, which might prevented have his falling. Or should another Country take me home As one of hers; when thither I did come I would not seek, nor wish to innovate The Titles, or the Customes of that State, To what some other Countries better thought: But, leave such things to those to whom I ought. And, there, if any Faction shall constraine That I one part must take, I will maintaine What bore the Sov'raignty when I came thither; And, I and that will stand and fall together. The same obedience, also, keepe I shall, To governments Ecclesiasticall Where e're I come; if nothing they command Which doth Gods word, essentially, withstand: Or, indirectly, or directly, thwart His glory, or the purity pervert Of Christian Principles, nor further strife, Nor cause, nor countenance an evill life. The Hyerarchy, here, I will obey, And reverence, while I in England stay. In Scotland if I liv'd, I would deny No due respect to their Presbyterie. Geneva should I visit, I would there Submit my selfe to what their customes were. Yea, wheresoe're I am, I will suppose The Spirit in that Church much better knowes What best that place befitteth, then I do: And, I will live conformed thereunto, In ev'ry thing that's meerly politick, And injuries not the Doctrines Catholick. To ev'ry temp'rall pow'r I'le be the same, By whatsoever cognizance, or name, Men please to call it. If I should be sent To Poland, where a mixed government Establisht is; I would not tell them, there, That any other Custome better were Were I in Switzerland, I would maintaine Democrity; and, thinke to make it plaine, That for these Times, those Cantons, and that Nation, There could not be a better Domination. In Venice, far before a Monarchy I would prefer an Aristocratie. In Spaine, and France, and in great Britaine here I hold no Goverments more perfect are Then Monarchies. And, if Gods will should be, Beneath a Tyrant to envassaile me, I would perswade my selfe, that heavy yoake Were best, for some respects; and, to the stroke Ev'n of an iron Mace would subject be, In Body; with a minde that should be free From his inforcement, (if he did withstand, Or bid me what Gods Law doth countermand.) There is, I know, a middle-way that lies Ev'n just betwixt the two extremities, Which to sedition, and to faction tend. To find which tract, my whole desire I bend; And wish it follow'd more. For, if we tread That harmelesse path, we cannot be mis-led; Nor sham'd, though blam'd we be. To ev'ry man I faine would give his due; and all I can I doe endeavour it. I would not wrong My Country; neither take what doth belong To Cesar: nor infringe, or prejudice, The vnivesall Churches liberties; Nor for her outward Discipline prefer Or censure, any Church particular; Or any State, but as befit it may, His Muse, which nought but needfull truths doth say. Nor have I any purpose to withdraw Obedience, or respect from any Law That's positive; or, to dishearten from Those Customes, which a Christian state become. Nor have I any thought to scandalize, Or speake a misse of Principalities; Or, to traduce mens persons: but, I fall On errors of mens lives in generall, And, on those great abuses, which I see To blemish ev'ry Calling and Degree Of Dignities and Persons, I observe, All meanes I can, their honours to preserve, When I reprove their faults. And, ev'n as he That hunteth Foxes, where Lambes feeding be, May fright that harmelesse flock, and suffer blame Of some By-standers, (knowing not his Game) When from his Dogs, those innocents are free, And none but their devourers bitten be. So, though my reprehensions, often are Mistooke by foolish Readers; they are far From reprehending those, or taxing that Which is unfitting for my shooting at. I speake those things which will advantage rather Then harme: and hence this blinded age may gather Much light. Thich little volume doth relate Nought else but what is like to be our fate, If sin increase; and what in former times Did fall on other Nations for their crimes. I utter what our welfare may increase, And helpe confirme us in a happy peace; Which they will never compasse, who pursue To speake what's pleasing, rather then what's true, How ever, here my thoughts deliv'red be: Let God, as he shall please, deliver me. And if what here is mention'd, thou dost heed (Oh Brittaine!) in those times that shall succeed, It may prevent much losse, and make thee shun Those mischiefes, whereby Kingdomes are undone. But, to thy other sins, if thou shalt adde Rebellions (as false Prophets will perswade) Which likely are to follow, when thou shalt In thy profession of Religion halt: Then, will thy Kings and People scourge each other, For their offences, till both fall together: By weakning of your pow'rs, to make them way, Who seeke and look for that unhappy day. Then, shall disorder ev'ry where abound And neither just nor pious man be found The best shall be a Bryer or a Thorne, By whom their neighbours shall be scratcht and torne. Thy Princes shall to nothing condiscend For any merit, just, or pious end; But either for encreasing of their treasure, Or for accomplishing their wilfull pleasure: And unto what they sell or daine for meede, There shall be given little trust or heed. For, that which by their words confirme they shall, (The royall Seales uniting therewithall) A toy shall frustate; and a gift shall make Their strictest Orders no effect to take. The Iudge, without a bribe, no cause shall end: No man shall trust his brother, or his friend: The parents and the children shall despise And hate, and spoyle each other: she that lies Within her husbands bosom, shall betray him: They who thy people should protect, shall slay them: The aged shall regarded be of none: The poore shall by the rich be troden on: Such grievous insolencies, every where Shall acted be, that good and bad shall feare In thee to dwell; and, men discreet shall hate To be a Ruler, or a Magistrate; When they behold (without impenitence) So much injustice, and such violence. And, when thy wickednesse this height shall gaine, To which (no doubt) it will e're long attaine, If thou proceede: Then, from the bow that's bent (And halfe way drawne already) shall be sent A mortall arrow: and it pierce thee shall Quite through the head, the liver, and the gall. The Lord shall call, and whistle from afarre, For those thy enemies that fiercest are: For those thou fearest most; and they shall from Their Countries, like a whirlewind hither come, They shall not sleepe, nor stumble, nor untie Their garments, till within thy field they lye, Sharpe shall their arrowes be, and strong their bow, Their faces shall as full of hot or show As doth a Lions. Like a bolt of thunder Their troopes of horse shall come, and tread thee under Their yron feet. Thy foes shall eate thy bread, And with thy flocks both clothed be, and fed. Thy Dwellers, they shall carry from their owne, To Countries which their fathers have not knowne. And, thither shall such mischiefes them pursue, That they who seeke the pit-fall to eschew, Shall in a snare be taken. If they shall Escape the sword, a serpent in the wall To death shall sting them: yea (although they hap; To shun a hundred plagues) they shall not scape; But, with new dangers, still be chac'd about, Vntill that they are wholly rooted out. The Plowman, then, shall be afraid to sow; Artificers their labour shall forgoe; The Marchant man shall crosse the Seas no more, (Except to flye and seeke some other shore) Thy ablest-men shall faint: thy wise-ones, then, Shall know themselves to be but foolish men. And they who built and planted by oppression, Shall leave their gettings to the foes possession. Yea, God will scourge thee, England, seven times more With seven times greater Plagues then heretofore, Then, thy Allies their friendship shall withdraw; And, they that of thy greatnesse stood in awe, Shall say (in scorne) Is this the valiant Nation, That had throughout the world such reputation, By victories upon the shore? are these That people, which were master of the seas, And grew so mighty? yea that petty Nation, That were not worthy of thy indignation, Shall mocke thee too; and all thy former fame, Forgot shall be, or mention'd to thy shame. Marke how Gods Plagues were doubled on the Jewes When they his mild corrections did abuse Marke what, at last upon their Land he sent; And, looke thou for the selfe same punishment, If them thou imitatest. I or their sin, At first, but eight yeares Bondage they were in. Their wickednesse grew more; and God did then, To Eglon, make them slaves, eight yeares and ten They disobeying, still, the God of heaven; Their yeare of Servitude were twenty seven, To Jabin and to Midian. Then, prevailed Philistia forty yeares; and, when that failed, To make them of their evill waies repent; There was, among themselves, a fatall rent; And, they oft scourg'd each other. Still, they trod The selfesame path; and, then the hand of God Brought Ashur on them; and, did make them beare His heavie yoake, untill the seventeenth yeare. And last of all the Roman Empire came, Which from their Country rooted out their Name, That foolish project which they did imbrace, To keep them in possession of their place, Did loose it. And, like Cain, that vagrant Nation, Hath now remain'd in fearefull Desolation Nigh sixteene hundred yeares: and, whatsoe're Some lately dreame) in vaine, they looke for here A temp'rall Kingdome. For, as long agoe Their Psalmist said; No Prophet doth foreshow This thraldoms end. Nor shall it end untill The Gentiles their just number doe fulfill: Which is unlike to be untill that houre, In which there shall be no more temporall pow'r, Of temporall Kingdome. Therefore gather them (Oh Lord!) unto thy new Ierusalem, In thy due time. For, yet unto that place They have a promist right, by thy meere grace. To those who shall repent, thy firme Election Continues in this temporall rejection. Oh! shew thy mercy in their desolation, That thou maist honor'd be in their salvation Yea, teach us also, by their fearefull fall, To harken to thy voyce, when thou dost call; (Lest thou in anger, unto us protest, That we shall never come into thy rest) For, we have follow'd them in all their sin: Such, and so many, have our warnings bin: And if thou still prolong not thy compassion, To us belongs the selfesame Desolation. And it will shortly come, with all those terrors That we on them inflicted, for their errors. Then, woe shall be to them that heretofore By joyning house, to house expell'd the poore; And field have into field incoporated, Vntill their Township were depopulated. For, desolate their dwelling shall be made: Ev'n in their blood the Lord shall bathe his blade: And they that have by avarice, and wiles, Erected Pallaces and costly Piles; Shall thinke, the stones and timbers in the wall, Aloud, to God, for vengeance on them call. Then, woe shall be to them who early rise To eate, and drinke, and play, and wantonnize; Still adding sin to sin: for, they the paine Of cold, and thirst, and hunger, shall sustaine; And be the servile slaves of them that are Their foes, as to their lusts they captives were. Then woe to them who darkenesse more have lov'd Then light; and good advice have disapprov'd: For, they shall wander in a crooked path, Which neither light, nor end, nor comfort hath. And, when for Guides, and Counsell they doe cry, Not one shall pitty them, who passeth by. Then, woe to them that have corrupted bin, To justifie the wicked in his sinne; Or, for a bribe, the righteous to condemne: For, flames (as on the chaffe) shall seize on them: Their bodies to the dunghill shall be cast: Their flowre shall turne to dust; their stock shall wast, And all the glorious titles they have worne, Shall but increase their infamy and scorne, Then woe to them that have beene rais'd aloft By good mens ruines; and by laying soft And easie pillowes, under great mens armes, To make them pleas'd in their alluring charmes. Then, woe to them who being growne afraid Of some nigh perill, sought unlawfull aid; And, setting Gods protection quite aside, Vpon their owne inventions have rely'd. For, God their foolish hopes will bring to nought; On them, their feared mischiefe shall be brought; And, all their wit and strength, shall not suffice, To have their sorrow off, which on them lies. Yea, then, oh Britaine! woe to ev'ry one, That hath without repentance evill done: For, those who doe not heed, nor beare in mind, His visitings, Gods reaching hand will find; And they with howling cries and lamentation, Shall sue and seeke, in vaine, for his compassion. Because they carelesse of his Mercies were, Till in consumming wrath he did appeare. But, still, we set far off that evill day; In dull security we passe away Our pretious time; and with vaine hopes and toyes, Build up a trust which ev'ry puffe destroyes. And therefore, still when healing is expected, New and unlookt for troubles are effected. We gather Armies, and we Fleets prepare; And, then, both strong and safe we thinke we are. But, when we looke for victories, and glory, What followes, but events that make us sory? And tis Gods mercy that we turne our faces With so few losses, and no more disgraces. For, what are most of those whom we commend Such actions to; and whom we forth do send To fight those Battles, which the Lords we call, But, such as never fight for him at all? Whom dost thou make thy Captaines, and dispose Such Offices unto, but unto those (Some few excepted) who procure by friends, Command and pay, to serve their private ends? Their language, and their practices declare, That entertained by Gods Foe they were. Their whoring, swearing, and their drunkennesse, Do far more plainely to the world expresse What Generall they doe belong unto, Then all their Feathers and their Ensignes doe. These by their unrepented sinnes, betray Thy Cause. By these, the honour, and the day Is lost: and when thou hopest that thy trouble Shall have and end, thy danger waxeth double. We wisht for Parliaments; and them we made Our Cod: for, all the hope that many had To remedy the publike discontent, Was by the wisedome of a Parliament. Well; Parliaments we had; and what in beeing, Suceedeth yet, but greater disagreeing, With greater grievances then heretofore? And reason good: for, we depended more On outward meanes, then on Gods will that sends All punishments; and all afflictions ends. Beleeve it, should our Parliaments agree In ev'ry motion: should our Sov'raigne be So gracious, as to condiscend to all Which for his weale and ours, propose we shall; Ev'n that Agreement, till our sins we leave, Shall make us but secure; and helpe to weave A snare, by whose fine threads we shall be caught, Before we see the mischiefe that is wrought. Whilst we by Parliament doe chiefly seeke Mere temp'rall ends, the King shall doe the like: Yea, till in them we mutually agree To helpe each other; and unfained be In lab'ring for a Christian Reformation; Each Meeting shall beget a new vexation. This Jland hath hath some sense of what she ayle And very much, these evill times bewailes: But, not so much our sins doe we lament, Or mourne, that God for them is discontent, As that the Plagues they being disturb our pleasures, Encrease our dangers, and exhaust our treasures. And, for these causes, now and then we fast, And pray, as long as halfe a day doth last. For, if the Sunne doe hut a little cleare That cloud, from which a tempest we doe feare, What kind of griefe we tooke, we plainely shew By those rejoycings which thereon ensue: For, in the stead of such due thankefulnesse, As Christian zeale obligeth to expresse; To pleasure (not to God) we sacrifice; Renew our sinne; revive our vanities; And, all our vowed gratitude expires, In Games, in Guns, in Bels, in Healths, or Fires. We faine would be at peace; but few men go That way, as yet, whereby it may be so. We have not that humility which must Effect it: we are false, and cannot trust Each other; no nor God with true confessions: Which shewes that we abhor not our transgressions. It proves, that of our errors, we in heart Repent not, neither purpose to depart From any folly. For all they that are Sincerely penitent, doe nothing feare So much as their owne guilt; nor seeke to gaine Ought more, then to be reconcil'd againe: And they that are thus minded, never can Be long unreconcil'd to God, or man. When we should stoope, we most our selves exalt And (though we be) would not be thought in fault. Nay, though we faulty be, and though [illeg.]and knowne, And proved so, and see that we are throwne By our apparent errors, into straits, From which we cannot get by all our sleights. Yet, still our selves we vaunt and justifie, And struggle, till the snare we faster tye. We sin, and we to boast it have no shame, Yet storme when others doe our follies name: And rather then we will so much as say We did amisse (though that might wipe away The staine of all) I thinke that some of us So wilfull are, so proud, and mischievous, That we our selves, would ruine, and our Nation, To keepe our shadow of a Reputation. Oh! if we are thus headstrong, tis unlike We any part of our proud sailes will strike Till they have suncke our vessell in the Sea, Or by the furious windes, are torne away. Twere better, tho, we did confesse our wound, Then hide it till our state grew more unsound. Twere better we some wealth, or office lost, Then keepe them, till our lives, and all, it cost: And therefore, let us wisely be advised, Before we by a tempest be surprised. Downe first with our Top-gallants, and our Flags; In stormes the skilfull'st Pilots make no brags. Let us (if that be not enough) let fall Our Misne-yeard, and strike our top-sailes all. If this we finde be not enough to doe, Strike Fote-saile, Sprit-saile yea and Main-saile too. And, rather then our Ship should sink or rend; Let's over-board, goods, mast, and tackling send. Save but the Hull, the Master, and the Men; And we may live to scoure the seas agen. Beleeve it England, howsoever some (Who should foresee thy plagues before they come) Endeavour to perswade thee that thou hast A hopefull time, and that the worst is past. Yet I dare boldly tell thee, thou hast nigh Worne out Gods patience by impiety. And, that unlesse the same we doe renue By penitence, our folly we shall rue. But, what am I, that me thou should'st beleeve? Or, unto what I tell thee, credit give It may be this adultrous Generation Expecteth tokens of her desolation; And therefore I will give them signes of that Which they are now almost arrived at. Not signes, so mysticall as most of those Which did the ruine of the Iewes disclose; But, signes as evident as are the day. For, know ye Britaines, that what God did say Ierusalems destruction should foreshew, He spake to ev'ry State that should ensue. And, that he nought of her, or to her spake For hers alone, but also for our sake. One signe that Gods long-suffering we have tired, And that his patience is almost expired. Is this; that many judgements he hath sent, And still remov'd them e're we did repent. For, God (ev'n by his Holinesse) did sweare, (Saith Amos) such a Nation he will teare With bryers, and with Fish hookes rend away The whole posterity of such as they. Cleane teeth (saith God) I gave them; and with bread In many places, them I scantly fed; And yet they sought me not: Then I restrained The dewes of heav'n; upon this Field I rained, And not on that; yea, to one City came Some two or three, to quench their thirsty flame; Yet, to returne to me, no care they tooke; With Blasiings then, and Mildewes, I them strooke; And mixt among their Fruits the Palmer-worme; Yet, they their lives did not a jot reforme: Then did I send the Pestilence (said he) Devoured by the Sword, their young men be; Their Horse are slaine, and up to heaven ascends Their stinke; yet I discover no amends The selfe same things thy God in thee hath done, Oh England! yet, here followes thereupon So small amendment, that they are a signe To thee; and their sharpe Judgement, will be thine. The second Token which doth fore-declare When Cities States, and Realmes, declining are, Ev'n Christ himselfe hath left us: for, (saith he) When Desolation shall approaching be, Of wars, and warlike rumours ye shall heare; Rare signes and tokens will in heaven appeare; Downe from the Firmament the starres shall fall; The hearts of many men, then, faile them shall; There will be many scandals and offences; Great earthquakes, Schismes, Dearths, and Pestilences, Realme, Realme; and Nation, Nation shall oppose; The nearest friends, shall be the greatest foes. Against the Church shall many tyrannize; Deceivers, and false Prophets, shall arise; In ev'ry place shall wickednesse abound; And, Charity shall very cold be befound. This Christ himselfe did Prophecy: and we Are doubtlesse blind, unlesse confest it be, That at this houre, upon this Kingdome here, These markes of Desolation viewed are. How often have we seene prodigious lights, O'respread the face of heav'n in moonlesse nights? How many dreadfull Meteors, have there beene In this our Climate, lately heard and seene? Who knoweth not that but a while agoe A Blazing-Star did threat, if not foreshow Gods Judgements, In what age, tofore did heare So many, who did Saints and Stars appeare, Fall (as it were) from heav'n? Or who hath heard Of greater Earth-quakes, then hath lately scar'd These quarters of the world? How oft, the touch Of Famine have we had? But, when so much Devoured by the Pestilence were we, As in this present yeare, our people be? Of Wars, and martiall rumors, never more Were heard within these confines heretofore; When were all Kingdomes, and all Nations through The world, so opposite as they are now We know no Country, whether nigh or far, But is engag'd, or threatned with some War. All places, either present woes bewaile; Or else things feared make mens hearts to faile. False Prophets, and Deceivers we have many; We scarcely finde integrity in any: The Name of Christ, beginnes in ev'ry place To suffer persecution and disgrace; And, we the greatest jeopardies are in, Among our neighbours, and our nearest kin. Strange Heresies doe ev'ry where encrease, Disturbing Sion, and exiling peace. Impiety doth multiply. True love Growes cold. And, if these tokens doe not prove Our fall drawes on, unlesse we doe amend: I know not when our folly shall have end. A third apparant signe which doth declare When some devouring Plague approacheth neere, Is when a Nation doth anew begin To let Idolatry to enter in; And openly, or secretly give place To Heresie, where Truth establisht was: Or when like Jeroboam, to possesse An outward profit, or a temporall peace, They either change Religions, or devise A worship which doth mixe Idolatries With truth: For this, ev'n for this very crime. The King of Ashur, in Hosea's time Led Isr'el captive And, both from the sight Of God; and from the house of David quite, They were cut off for ever, and did neither Serve God nor Idols; but ev'n both together; In such a mixt Religion as is that Which some among us, now, have aymed at. Marke England; and I prethee marke it well, If this offence which ruin'd Israel, On thee appeare not: and, if so it be, Amend; or looke for what it threatens thee. The fourth true token which doth fore-expresse The ruine of a Land for wickednesse, Is when the Priests and Magistrates begin, To grow extreamly impudent in sin. This Signe, the Prophet Micah giveth us; And he (not I) to you cryes loudly thus: Heare, O ye house of Jacob, and all ye That Princes of the house of Israel be: Ye Justice hate; and ye pervert what's good; Ye build the wals of Sion up with bloud; Jerusalem with sin, ye up have rear'd, Your Judges passe their censures for reward; Your Priests doe preach for hire, your Prophets doe Like them; and prophecy for money too. And, for this cause shall Sion mount (saith he) Ev'n like a plowed field become to be; And like a Forrest hill where bushes grow. The Citie of Jerusalem shall show. Change but the names, oh Britain, and that token Of desolation, unto thee is spoken. For, what this day thy Priests and Princes are, Their actions, and the peoples cryes declare. A fifth sure evidence that God among Thy ruines will entomb thy fame e're long, (If thou repent not) is ev'n this, that thou Dost ev'ry day the more ungodly grow, By how much more the blessed meanes of grace Doth multiply it selfe in ev'ry place, God sends unto thee many learned Preachers, Apostles, Pastors, and all kind of teachers; His Visions, and his Prophecies upon thee He multiplies. And (that he might have won thee To more sinceritie) on all occasions, By counsell, by entreatie, and perswasions, He hath advis'd, allured, and besought thee: With precept upon precept, he hath taught thee; By line on line; by miracle; by reason; In ev'ry place; in season, out of season; By little and by little; and by much (Sometime) at once: yet is thy nature such, That still thou waxest worse; and in the roome Of pleasant Grapes, more Thistles daily come: And, thou that art so haughty, and so proud, For this, shalt vanish like an empty cloud; And, as a Lion, Leopard, or a Beare, Thy God, for this, shall thee in pieces teare. If thou suppose my Muse did this devise, Goe take it from Hosea's Prophesies The sixth undoubted signall when the last Good dayes of sinfull Realmes are almost past, Is when the people neere to God shall draw In word, to make profession of his Law: And by their tongues his praises forth declare: Yet, in their hearts from him continue far. To such a Land, their destiny displayes Isaiah: for even this the Prophet sayes: God will produce a marvell in that state And doe a worke that men shall wonder at; The wisedome of their wisest Counsellor, Shall perish, and their prudent men shall erre. On their deepe Counsels, sorrow shall attend; Their secret plots shall have a dismall end; Their giddy projects which they have devised, Shall as the Potters clay be quite despised. Like Carmel, Lebanon shall seeme; and he Like Lebanon, shall make mount Carmel be. Their pleasant Fields like Desarts shall appeare; And, there shall Gardens be, where Desarts are. God keepe (thou Brittish Jle) this plague from thee; For, signes thereof upon thy Body be. Thou of the purest worship mak'st profession, Yet, waxest more impure in thy condition. Thou boastest of the knowledge of Gods word, Yet, thereunto in manners to accord Thou dost refuse. Thou makest protestation Of pietie, yet hatest reformation. Yea, when thy tongue doth sing of praise divine, Thy heart doth plot some temporall designe. And, some of those, who in this wife are holy, Begin to shew the[illeg.] wisedome will be folly. For, when from sight their snares they deepest hide. By God Almighties eyes they are espide. The seventh Symptoms of a dreadfull blow, (If not of a perpetuall overthrow) Is when a slumbring Spirit doth surprize A nation, and hath closed up their eyes: Or when the Prophets and the Seers are So clouded, that plaine truths doe not appeare: Or when the Visions evidently seene Are passed by, as if they had not beene: Or when to Nations who can reade, God gives His Booke; and thereof doth unseale the leaves, And bids them reade the same, which they to do Deny, or pleade unablenesse thereto. Blacke signes are these. For if that Booke to them, Still darke; or as a Book unsealed seeme; Or, if they heede no more what here is said, Then they that have the Booke and cannot reade; The Iudgements, last repeated, are the doome, That shall on such a stupid Nation come. This signe is come on us, for, loe, unsealed Gods Booke is now amongst us, and revealed Are all the Mysteries which doe concerne The children of this present age to learne. So well hath he instructed this our land, That we not onely reade, but understand The secrets of his Word. The prophecies Of his chiefe Seers, are before our eyes, Vnveiled [illeg.] interpretations Are made, and many proper applications Ev'n to ourselves ye[illeg.] our heart so blind, That what we know and see we doe not mind. We heare, and speake and much adoe we keepe; But we as senselesse are as men asleepe. What then we doe. Yea, while that we are talking, What snares are in the way where we are walking, We heed not what we say, but passe along; And, many times, are fast insnar'd among Those mischiefes, and those faults we did condemne, Before our tongues have let to mention them. For our neglect of God in former times, (Or for some present unrepented crimes) A slumbring Spirit so possesseth us, That our estate is wondrous dangerous. We see and heare, and tell to one another Our perils, yet we headlong haste together To wilfull ruine and are growne so mad, That when our friends a better course perswade, Or seek to stop us (when they see we run. That way in which we cannot ruine shun) We persecute those men with all our soule, That we may damn our selves without controule. The eight plaine Signe, by which I understand That some devouring mischiefe is at hand, Is that maliciousnesse which I doe see Among Professors of one Faith to be. We that have but one Father, and one Mother, Doe persecute, and torture one another. So hotly, we oppose not Antichrist, As we our fellow-brethren doe resist. The Protestant, the Protestant defies; And, we our selves, our selves doe scandalize. Our Church we have exposed to more scorne; And her faire seamlesse Vest[illeg.]nt rent, and [illeg.]ome, By our owne fury, more then by their spight Who are to us directly opposite. To save an Apple, we the Tree destroy; And, quarrels make for ev'ry needlesse toy: From us, if any brother differ shall But in a crochet, we upon him fall As eagerly, and with as bitter hate, As if we knew him for a Reprobate. And, what ever all this doth signifie, Saint Paul (by way of caveat) doth imply. Take heed (saith he) lest while ye bite each other, You, of your selves, consumed be together. Another Signe which causeth me to feare That our confusion is approaching neere, Are those Disunions which I have espide, In Church, and Common-wealth, this present tide. We cannot hide these rents; for they doe gape, So wide, that some their Jawes can hardly scape. Would God, the way to close them up we knew, Else, what they threaten, time will shortly shew; For, all men know, a Citie or a Land, Within it selfe divided, cannot stand. The last blacke Signe that here I will repeat, (Which doth to Kingdomes desolation threat) Is when the hand of God Almighty brings The people, into bondage, to their Kings. I say, when their owne King shall take delight, Those whom he should protect, to rob, and smite. When they who fed the Sheep, the Sheep shall kill, And eate them; and suppose they doe no ill. When God gives up a Nation unto those That are their neighbours, that they may, as foes, Devoure them. When (oh England!) thou shalt see This come to passe, a signe it is to thee That God is angry; and a certaine token That into pieces thou shalt quite be broken: If not by forraine strength by force at home; And, that thy greater torment will become. This Vengeance, and this fearefull preparation, Of bringing ruine on a sinfull Nation, (If they remaine impenitent) the Lord Doth menace; and, by Zachary record, To make us wise. Oh! let us therefore learne, What now is comming on us, to discerne. For, (well considered if all things were) From this Captivity we seeme not farre. It now already seemes to be projected; Nay, little wants of being quite effected. For, they that are our Shepheards, now, are they That fleece us, and endevor to betray Our lives and freedomes. Those great men that be Our neighbours (and can claime no more then we) Would sell us: and, attempt to gaine a pow'r, Whereby they may, at pleasure, us devoure: And had not we a King, as loth to make His people slaves, as from himselfe to take His lawfull right; (or, were there not some lett Vnheeded, which is unremoved yet) E're this (and justly too) the hand of heaven Into perpetuall bondage us had given. And, if we doe not more Gods will regard, That mischiefe is but for a time deferr'd. Our King is just and mercifull; and tho Some may (with loyall, and a gilded show Of pious equity) a while assay To leade his judgement in his youth astray; Yet, God (I hope) will keepe him so, that he Shall still be just, (though we ungodly be) And make him in the fittest houre expresse His royall Iudgement, and his Righteousnesse. But, if God should from us (as God forbid) Take him, as once he good Josiah did, He also will (unlesse we mend) perchance, In times to come, a Shepheard here advance, Who shall not plead for what his Young men say Is just; but, take the same, perforce, away. An Idoll Shepheard, who shall neither care To find or seek, for those that strayed are; Nor guard the Lambs; nor cure, what hath a wound; Nor cherish those that firme to him are found; But, take the fat, and rob them of their fleeces; And eate their flesh; and break their bones in peeces. More Signes I might, as yet, commemorate, To shew Gods patience is nigh out of date. But, these are signes enough, and so apparant, That twenty more will give no better warrant To what I speake. Yet, if these false appeare, That's one signe more, our fall approacheth neere. Be mindfull, therefore, while it is to Day; And, let no good occasion slip away. Now rend your hearts, ye Britaines, wash &amp; rinse them From all corruption: from all evill clense them. Goe offer up the pleasing sacrifice Of Righteousnesse: from folly turne your eyes. Seeke peace, and follow it, with strict pursuit: Relieve the needy, Judgement execute: Refresh the weary; right the fatherlesse: The strangers, and the widowes wants redresse: Give praise to God; depend with lowly faith, On him; and what his holy Spirit saith: Remember what a price thy ransome cost; And, now redeeme the time that thou hast lost. Returne, returne thou (oh back sliding Nation) And, let thy teares prevent thy desolation. As yet, thou moist returne; for, Gods embrace Is open for thee, if thou hast the grace, To give it meeting. Yet, repentance may Prevent the mischiefes of that evill day, Which here is menac'd: yet, thou maist have peace, And by discreet endeavouring, encrease Each outward grace, and ev'ry inward thing, Which will additions to thy comfort bring. If this thou doe; these fearfull threatnings all, (Repeated here) to mercies change he shall. We cannot say, it will excuse thee from. All chastisement; or that no blow shall come. For, peradventure, thou so long hast bin Unpenitent, that some loud crying sin Hath wak'd that Vengeance, which upon thy crimes Must fall (as once in Jeremiahs times) Without prevention; to exemplifie Gods hate of sin to all posteritie. But, sure we are, that if he doth not stay His threatned hand, the stroke that he doth lay Will fall the lighter; and become a blessing, Thy future joyes, and vertues more encreasing, Than all that large prosperity and rest Which thou, so long together, hast possest. God (with a Writers inke horne) one hath sent, To set a marke on them that shall repent; And bids him promise in his Name, that they Who shall (recanting) leave their evill way, And in their hearts, bewaile the grievous crimes, And miseries of Sion; in their times; That they shall be secure, and saved from The hand of these Destroyers, which must come: Or else by their destruction find a way To that repairing which will ne're decay. Yea, thou, oh Britaine! if thou couldst reforme Thy manners, might'st expell the dreadfull storme Now threathed; and thy foes (who triumph would. The ruine of thy glory to behold. And jeere thee when thou fallest) soone shall see Thy God returning; and avenging thee On their insultings: yea, with angry blowes He would effect their shamefull overthrowes. Or turne their hearts. For when from sin men cease, God makes their enemies, and them, at peace. Moreover, thou shalt have in thy possessing, Each inward grace, and ev'ry outward blessing; Thy fruitfull Herds shall in rich pastures feed; Thy soyle shall plenteously encrease thy seed; Thy Flock, shall neither Shepherds want, nor meat; Cleane provander, thy stabled beast shall eate; There shall be Rivers in thy Dales; and Fountaines Upon the tops of all thy noblest Mountaines: The Moone shall cast upon thee beames as bright As now the Sunne, and with a sevenfold light The Sunne shall blesse thee. He that reignes in thee, To all his people reconcil'd shall be; And they shall find themselves no whit deceived, In those good hopes which are of him conceived. But he, (and they, who shall his throne possesse When he is gone) shall reigne in righteousnesse; And be more carefull of thy weale (by far) Then parents of their childrens profits are. Thy Magistrates, with wisdome shall proceed In all that shall be counsell'd or decreed. As Harbours, when it blowes tempestuously; As Rivers, unto places over-dry; As Shadowes are to men opprest with heat; As to a hungry stomack, wholsome meat; To thee, so welcome, and as much contenting, Thy Nobles will become, on thy repenting. Thy Priests shall preach true doctrine in thy Temples; And make it fruitfull by their good examples. Thy God, with righteousnesse shall them aray, And heare and answer them, when they doe pray. Thy eyes, that much are blinded, shall be cleare; Thy eares, that yet are deafned, then shall heare; Thy tongue, that stammers now, shall then speak plain, Thy heart shall perfect understanding gaine; The preaching of the Gospell shall encrease; Thy God shall make thy comforts and thy peace, To flow as doth a River; they who plant, The blessing of their labour shall not want; Thy poorest people shall at full be fed; The meek, shall of no tyrant stand in dread; Thou shalt have grace and knowledge to avoid Those things, whereby the rest, may be annoid; Thou shalt possesse thy wished blessings all; And, God shall heare thee still before thou call. But, as a Chime, whose frets disordered grow, Can never cause it selfe in tune to goe, Nor chime at all, untill some cunning hand Doth make the same againe in order stand: Or, as the Clock, whose plummets are not weight, Strikes sometimes one for three and six for eight; So fareth it with men and kingdomes all, When once from their integrity they fall. They may their motion hurry out of frame, But have no pow'r to rectifie the same. That curious hand which first those pieces wrought, Must mend them still; or they will still be nought. To thee I therefore now my speed convert, Thou famous Artist, who Creator art Of heav'n and earth, and of those goodly Spheares, That now have whirled many thousand yeares, (And shall until thy pleasure gives it ending) In their perpetuall motion, without mending. Oh! be thou pleased, by thy pow'rfull hand, To set in order thin depraved Land. Our whole foundation, Lord, is out of course; And ev'ry thing still groweth worse and worse; The way that leads quite from thee, we have tooke Thy Covenant, and all thy Lawes are broke; In mischiefes, and in folly, is our pleasure; Our crying sins have almost filld their measure; Yet, ev'ry day we adde a new transgression, And still abuse thy favour and compassion. Our Government, our Prelates, and our Nobles, Have by their [illeg.] encrease; encreast our troubles, Our Priests, and all the People, have misgone, All kind of evill deeds, we all have done. We have not lived as those meanes of grace Require, which thou hast granted to this place But rather worse than many who have had Lesse helpes than we, of being better made. No Nation under heav'n so gr?owne? hath bin, That had so many warnings for their sin, And such perpen[illeg.] [illeg.]altings on, as we, To leave our wickednesse, and turne to thee. Yet, we in stead of turning further went; And when thy Mercies and thy Plaques, were sent To pull us backe; they seldome wrought our stay, Or moved to repentance one whole day. No blessing, no affliction, hath a pow'r To move compunction in us, for one houre. Unlesse thou worke it. All that I can speake (And all that I have spoken) till thou breake And mollifie the heart, will fruitlesse be, Not onely in my hearers, but in me. If thou prepare not way for more esteeme, All these Remembrances will foolish seeme, Nay these, in stead of moving to repent, Will indignation move and discordent; Which will mens hardned hearts obdurate more. And make their fault much greater than before. Unlesse thou give a blessing, I may strive As well to make a marble stone alive, As to effect my purpose: yea, all this Like wholesome counsell to a mad man is, And, I for my good meaning shall become In pieces, or exposed be to scorne. For, they against thy word doe stop their eare; And wilde in disobedience, will not heare. In this, we all confesse our selves to blame, And that we therefore have deserved shame. Yea, Lord, we doe acknowledge, that for this There nothing else to us pertaining is, (Respecting our owne worth) but desolation, And finall rooting out, with our compassion. But gracious God, though such our merit be, Yet, mercy still pertaineth unto thee. To thee the act of pard'ning and forgiving, As much belongs (oh Father everliving) As plagues to us: and it were better far Our sinnes had lesse than their deservings are, Then that thy Clemency should be ourgone, By all the wickednesse that can be done. As well as theirs whose lives now lest them have, Thou canst command those bodies from the grave, Who stink, and putrifie, and buried be In their corruption. Such, oh Lord! are we. Oh! call us from this grave; and shew thy pow'r Upon this much polluted Land of our, Which is not onely sick of works unholy, But almost dead and buried in her folly. Forgive us all our slips, our negligences, Our sins of knowledge, and our ignorances; Our daring wickednesse; our bloudy crimes; And all the faults of past and present times. Permit not thy just wrath to [illeg.]e forever; In thy displeasure doe not still persever; But, call us from that pit of Death and Sin, And from that path of Hell which we are in. Remember, that this Vineyard hath a Vine, Which had her planting by that hand of thine. Remember, when from Egypt thou remov'dst it, With what entire affection, then, thou lov'dst it. How thou didst weed and dresse it heretofore; How thou didst hence it from the Forrest Bore; And thinke how sweet a vintage then it brought, When thy first worke upon her thou hadst wrought: Remember, that without thy daily care, The choicest plants, sone wilde and fruitlesse are; And, that as long as thou dost prune and dresse, The sowrest Vine shall bring a sweet encrease. Remember, also Lord, how still that Foe, Who first pursued us, doth seek to sow His tares among thy wheat; and to his pow'r, Break down thy fence, and trample and devoure The seeds of grace, as soone as they doe sprout; And is too strong, for us to keepe him out. Oh! let not him prevaile, such harme to doe us, As he desires, but, Lord, returne unto us. Returne in mercy. Though thou find us stack To come our selves, fetch, draw, and pull us back From our owne courses, by thy grace divine, And set, and keep us, in each way of thine. We from our foes have saved beene by thee; And in thy love, oh Lord! triumphed we. But now beheld, disgrac'd thou throwst us by, And we before our adversaries flye. At us our neighb'ring Nations laugh and jeere, And, us they soo[illeg.]e, whom late we made to feare. Oh God arise, reject us not for aye; No longer hide from us thy face away: But, come, oh come with speed to give us aid, And let us not be lost though we have straid. Vouchsafe that every one in his degree, The secret errors of his life may see; And, in his lawfull calling all his dayes, Performe his Christian duty, to thy praise. Give peace this troublous age for, pe[illeg.] The times are growne, and no man fights for us But thou oh God! nor doe we seek or crave, That any other Champion we may have. Nay, give us troubles, if thy will be so, That we may have thy strength to beare them too; And in affliction thee more glorifie, Then heretofore in our prosperity. For when thy countenance on us did shine, Those Lands that boasted of their corne and wine, Had not that joy which thou didst than inspire, When we were boyld and fryde, in bloud and fire. Oh! give againe that joy, although it cost us Our lives. Restore thou without sin hath lost us. Thy Church, in these Dominions, Lord preserve In purity: and teach us thee to serve In holinesse and righteousnesse, untill We shall the number of our dayes fulfill. Defend these Kingdomes from all overthrowes, By forraigne enemies, or home-bred foes, Our King with ev'ry grace and vertue blesse, Which may thine honour and his owne increase. Inflame our Nobles with more love and zeale, To thy true Spouse, and to this Common-weale. Inspire our Clergie in their severall places, With knowledge, and all sanctifying graces; That by their lives and doctrines they may reare Those parts of Sion, which decayed are. Awake this People, give them soules that may Beleeve thy Word, and thy commands obey. The Plagues deserv'd already, save them from. More watchfull make them, in all times to come. For blessings past, let hearty thanks be given. For present ones, let sacrifice to heav'n Be daily offred up. For what is needing (Or may be usefull in the time succeeding) Let faithfull prayers to thy throne be sent, With hearts and hands upright and innocent: And let all this the better furthred be, Through these Remembrances, now brought by me. For which high favour, and emboldning thus My spirit, in a time so dangerous; For chusing me, that am so despicable, To be employed in this honorable And great employment (which I more esteeme, Than to be crowned with a Diadem) For thy enabling me in this Embassage; For bringing to conclusion this my Message; For sparing of my life, when thousands dy'd, Before, behind me, and on ev'ry side; For saving of me many a time since then, When I had forfeited my soule agen; For all those griefes and poverties, by which I am in better things made great, and rich, Then all that wealth and honour brings man to, Wherewith the world doth keepe so much adoe: For all which thou to me on earth hast given; For all, which doth concerne my hopes of heaven; For these, and those innumerable graces, Vouchsafed me, at sundry times, and places, (Unthought upon) unfained praise I render: And, for a living sacrifice, I tender To thee (oh God) my body, soule, and all, Which mine I may, by thy donation, call. Accept it blessed Maker, for his sake Who did this offring acceptable make, By giving up himselfe. Oh! looke thou not Upon those blemishes which I have got By naturall corruption; or by those Polluted acts which from that ulcer flowes According to my skill, I have enroll'd Thy Mercies; and thy Justice I have told. I have not hid thy workings in my brest; But as I could, their pow'r I have exprest. Among our great assemblies, to declare Thy will and pleasure, loe, I doe not feare: And though by Princes I am checkt and blamed; To speake the truth, I am no whit ashamed. Oh! shew thou, Lord, thy mercy so to me, And let thy Love and Truth, my guardians be! Forgive me all the follies of my youth; My faulty deeds; the errors of my mouth; The wandrings of my heart, and ev'ry one Of those good workes that I have left undone. Forgive me all wherein I did amisse, Since thou employd'st me in performing this: My doubtings of thy calling me unto it; My feares, which oft disheartned me to doe it; My sloth, my negligences, my evasions, And my deferring it, on vaine occasions, When I had vowed that no worke of mine, Should take me up, till I had finisht thine. Lord, pardon this; and let no future sin, Nor what already hath committed bin, Prophane this Worke; or cause the same to be The lesse effectuall to this Land, or me. But to my selfe (oh Lord) and others, let it So moving be, that we may ne're forget it. Let not the evill, nor the good effect It takes, or puffe me up, or me deject: Or make me thinke that I the better am, Because I tell how others are to blame: But, let it keepe me in a Christian feare, Still humbly heedfull what my actions are. Let all those observations I have had, Of others errors, be occasions made To mind me of mine owne. And, left I erre, Let ev'ry man be my Remembrancer; With so much charity, as I have sought To bring their duties more into our thought. And, if in any sin I linger long, Without repentance; Lord, let ev'ry tongue That names me, check me for it: and, to me Become, what I to others faine would be. Oh! let me not be like those busie broomes, Which having clensed many nasty roomes, Doe make themselves the fouler: but sweet Father, Let me be like the precious Diamond rather, Which doth by polishing another stone, The better shape and lustre, set upon His owne rough body. Let my life be such. As that mans ought to be, who knoweth much Of thy good pleasure. And, most awfull God, Let none of those who spread of me abroad Unjust reports, the Devills purpose gaine, By making these my warnings prove in vaine To those that heare them: but let such disgraces, Reflect with shame, upon their Authors faces, Till they repent. And let their scandall serve Within my heart true meeknesse to preserve; And that humility, which else, perchance, Vaine-glory, or some naturall arrogance Might overthrow, if I should think upon (With carnall thoughts) some good my lines have done. Restraine, moreover, them who out of pride, Or ignorance, this Labour shall deride. Make them perceive, who shall prefer a story Composed for some temporall friends glory, Before those Poems which thy works declare, That vaine and witlesse their opinions are: And, if by thee I was appointed, Lord, Thy Judgements and thy Mercies to record, (As here I doe) set thou thy mark on those, Who shall despightfully the same oppose: And let it publikely be seene of all, Till of their malice they repent them shall. As I my conscience have discharged here, Without concealing ought for love, or feare; From furious men let me preserved be, And from the scorne of fooles deliver me. Vouchsafe at length some comforting reflection, According to the yeares of my affliction. On me, for good, some token please to show, That they who see it, may thy bounty know; Rejoyce, with fellow-feeling of the same, And joyne with me, in praising of thy Name. And lest (oh Lord!) some weake ones may despise My words, because of such necessities, As they have brought upon me, by their spight, Who to my Studies have beene opposite: Oh! give me that which may sufficient be, To make them know that I have served thee. And that my labours are by thee regarded, Although they seeme not outwardly rewarded. Those Honors, or that Wealth, I doe not crave, Which they affect, who most endeavored have To please the World. I onely aske to gaine, But food and rayment, Lord, for all my paine; And that the slaunders, and the poverties, Wherewith my patience thou shalt exercise, Make not these Lines, or me, become a scorne, Nor leave me to the world-ward, quite forlorne. Yet, in preferring of this humble Suit, I make not my request so absolute, As that I will capitulate, or tye To such conditions, thy dread Majesty. For, if to honour but an earthly Prince My Muse had sung; it had beene impudence To prompt his bounty; or, to doubt he might Forget to doe my honest Labours right. Doe therefore as thou pleasest: onely give Thy Servant grace contentedly to live, And, to be thankfull, whatsoever shall In this my weary Pilgrimage befall. Such things thou dost command me to require, With earnest, and an absolute desire: With which I come: beseeching I may finde Thy love continue, though none else be kinde; That blessednesse eternall I may get, Though all I lose on earth, to compasse it; And that, at last, when my accompt is eaven, My payment may be summon'd up in heaven. Lord, this will please me: call me quickly thither, And pay me there my wages all together: Not that which mine by merit seemes to be; But, what by thy meere grace is due to me. FINIS.</field>
