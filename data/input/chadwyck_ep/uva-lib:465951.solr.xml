      <field name="fulltext">THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION. A POEM. IN THREE BOOKS. ??????? ??? ???? ???????? ??? ???? ??? ???? ??????? ?????????. Epict. apud Arrian. II. 23. BOOK THE FIRST. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK. THE subject proposed. Difficulty of treating it poetically. The ideas of the divine mind, the origin of every quality pleasing to the imagination. The natural variety of constitution in the minds of men; with its final cause. The idea of a fine imagination, and the state of the mind in the enjoyment of those pleasures which it affords. All the primary pleasures of the imagination result from the perception of greatness, or wonderfulness, or beauty in objects. The pleasure from greatness, with its final cause. Pleasure from novelty or wonderfulness, with its final cause. Pleasure from beauty, with its final cause. The connexion of beauty with truth and good, applied to the conduct of life. Invitation to the study of moral philosophy. The different degrees of beauty in different species of objects: colour; shape; natural concretes; vegetables; animals; the mind. The sublime, the fair, the wonderful of the mind. The connexion of the imagination and the moral faculty. Conclusion. With what attractive charms this goodly frame Of nature touches the consenting hearts Of mortal men; and what the pleasing stores Which beauteous imitation thence derives To deck the poet's, or the painter's toil; My verse unfolds. Attend, ye gentle powers Of musical delight! and while i sing Your gifts, your honours, dance around my strain. Thou, smiling queen of every tuneful breast, Indulgent Fancy! from the fruitful banks Of Avon, whence thy rosy fingers cull Fresh flowers and dews to sprinkle on the turf Where Shakespeare lies, be present: and with thee Let Fiction come, upon her vagrant wings Wafting ten thousand colours through the air, Which, by the glances of her magic eye, She blends and shifts at will, through countless forms, Her wild creation. Goddess of the lyre, Which rules the accents of the moving sphere, Wilt thou, eternal Harmony! descend And join this festive train? for with thee comes The guide, the guardian of their lovely sports, Majestic Truth; and where Truth deigns to come, Her sister Liberty will not be far. Be present all ye Genii, who conduct The wandering footsteps of the youthful bard, New to your springs and shades: who touch his ear With finer sounds: who heighten to his eye The bloom of nature, and before him turn The gayest, happiest attitude of things. Oft have the laws of each poetic strain The critic-verse imploy'd; yet still unsung Lay this prime subject, though importing most A poet's name: for fruitless is the attempt, By dull obedience and by creeping toil Obscure to conquer the severe ascent Of high Parnassus. Nature's kindling breath Must fire the chosen genius; nature's hand Must string his nerves, and imp his eagle-wings Impatient of the painful steep, to soar High as the summit; there to breathe at large Æthereal air: with bards and sages old, Immortal sons of praise. These flattering scenes To this neglected labour court my song; Yet not unconscious what a doubtful task To paint the finest features of the mind, And to most subtile and mysterious things Give colour, strength, and motion. But the love Of nature and the muses bids explore, Through secret paths erewhile untrod by man, The fair poetic region, to detect Untasted springs, to drink inspiring draughts, And shade my temples with unfading flowers Cull'd from the laureate vale's profound recess, Where never poet gain'd a wreath before. From heaven my strains begin; from heaven descends The flame of genius to the human breast, And love and beauty, and poetic joy And inspiration. Ere the radiant sun Sprang from the east, or 'mid the vault of night The moon suspended her serener lamp; Ere mountains, woods, or streams adorn'd the globe, Or wisdom taught the sons of men her lore; Then liv'd the almighty One: then, deep-retir'd In his unfathom'd essence, view'd the forms, The forms eternal of created things; The radiant sun, the moon's nocturnal lamp, The mountains, woods and streams, the rowling globe, And wisdom's mien celestial. From the first Of days, on them his love divine he fix'd, His admiration: till in time compleat, What he admir'd and lov'd, his vital smile Unfolded into being. Hence the breath Of life informing each organic frame, Hence the green earth, and wild resounding waves; Hence light and shade alternate; warmth and cold; And clear autumnal skies and vernal showers, And all the fair variety of things. But not alike to every mortal eye Is this great scene unveil'd. For since the claims Of social life, to different labours urge The active powers of man; with wise intent The hand of nature on peculiar minds Imprints a different byass, and to each Decrees its province in the common toil. To some she taught the fabric of the sphere, The changeful moon, the circuit of the stars, The golden zones of heaven: to some she gave To weigh the moment of eternal things, Of time, and space, and fate's unbroken chain, And will's quick impulse: others by the hand She led o'er vales and mountains, to explore What healing virtue swells the tender veins Of herbs and flowers; or what the beams of morn Draw forth, distilling from the clifted rind In balmy tears. . But some, to higher hopes Were destin'd; some within a finer mould She wrought, and temper'd with a purer flame. To these the sire omnipotent unfolds The world's harmonious volume, there to read The transcript of himself. On every part They trace the bright impressions of his hand: In earth or air, the meadow's purple stores, The moon's mild radiance, or the virgin's form Blooming with rosy smiles, they see portray'd That uncreated beauty, which delights The mind supreme. They also feel her charms, Enamour'd; they partake the eternal joy. For as old Memnon's image, long renown'd By fabling Nilus, to the quivering touch Of Titan's ray, with each repulsive string Consenting, sounded through the warbling air Unbidden strains; even so did nature's hand To certain species of external things, Attune the finer organs of the mind: So the glad impulse of congenial powers, Or of sweet sound, or fair proportion'd form, The grace of motion, or the bloom of light, Thrills through imagination's tender frame, From nerve to nerve: all naked and alive They catch the spreading rays: till now the soul At length discloses every tuneful spring, To that harmonious movement from without Responsive. Then the inexpressive strain Diffuses its inchantment: fancy dreams Of sacred fountains and Elysian groves, And vales of bliss: the intellectual power Bends from his awful throne a wondering ear, And smiles: the passions, gently sooth'd away, Sink to divine repose, and love and joy Alone are waking; love and joy, serene As airs that fan the summer. O! attend, Whoe'er thou art, whom these delights can touch, Whose candid bosom the refining love Of nature warms, o! listen to my song; And i will guide thee to her favourite walks, And teach thy solitude her voice to hear, And point her loveliest features to thy view. Know then, whate'er of nature's pregnant stores, Whate'er of mimic art's reflected forms With love and admiration thus inflame The powers of fancy, her delighted sons To three illustrious orders have referr'd; Three sister-graces, whom the painter's hand, The poet's tongue confesses; the sublime, The wonderful, the fair. I see them dawn! I see the radiant visions, where they rise, More lovely than when Lucifer displays His beaming forehead through the gates of morn, To lead the train of Phœbus and the spring. Say, why was man so eminently rais'd In apologizing for the frequent negligences of the sublimest authors of Greece, Those god-like geniuses, says Longinus, were well assured, that Nature had not intended man for a low-spirited or ignoble being: but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe, as before a multitude assembled at some heroic solemnity, that we might be spectators of all her magnificence, and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory; she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted, of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension. Whence it comes to pass, that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination, which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us. Let any man cast his eye through the whole circle of our existence, and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects, he will soon acknowledge for what injoyments and pursuits we were destined. Thus by the very propensity of nature we are led to admire, not little springs or shallow rivulets, however clear and delicious, but the Nile, the Rhine, the Danube, and, much more than all, the Ocean, &amp;c. Dionys. Longin. de Sublim. § xxiv. Amid the vast creation; why ordain'd Through life and death to dart his piercing eye, With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame; But that the omnipotent might send him forth In sight of mortal and immortal powers, As on a boundless theatre, to run The great career of justice; to exalt His generous aim to all diviner deeds; To chase each partial purpose from his breast; And through the mists of passion and of sense, And through the tossing tide of chance and pain, To hold his course unfaultering, while the voice Of truth and virtue, up the steep ascent Of nature, calls him to his high reward, The applauding smile of heaven? Else wherefore burns In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope, That breathes from day to day sublimer things, And mocks possession? wherefore darts the mind, With such resistless ardour to embrace Majestic forms; impatient to be free, Spurning the gross controul of wilful might; Proud of the strong contention of her toils; Proud to be daring? Who but rather turns To heaven's broad fire his unconstrained view, Than to the glimmering of a waxen flame? Who that, from Alpine heights, his labouring eye Shoots round the wide horizon, to survey Nilus or Ganges rowling his bright wave Through mountains, plains, through empires black with shade And continents of sand; will turn his gaze To mark the windings of a scanty rill That murmurs at his feet? The high-born soul Disdains to rest her heaven-aspiring wing Beneath its native quarry. Tir'd of earth And this diurnal scene, she springs aloft Through fields of air; pursues the flying storm; Rides on the vollied lightning through the heavens; Or, yok'd with whirlwinds and the northern blast, Sweeps the long tract of day. Then high she soars The blue profound, and hovering round the sun Beholds him pouring the redundant stream Of light; beholds his unrelenting sway Bend the reluctant planets to absolve The fated rounds of time. Thence far effus'd She darts her swiftness up the long career Of devious comets; through its burning signs Exulting measures the perennial wheel Of nature, and looks back on all the stars, Whose blended light, as with a milky zone, Invests the orient. Now amaz'd she views The empyreal waste Ne se peut-il point qui'l y a un grand espace au dela de la region des etoiles? Que ce soit le ciel empyrée, ou non, toujours cet espace immense qui environne toute cette region, pourra etre rempli de bonheur &amp; de gloire. Il pourra etre conqu comme l'ocean, où se rendent les fleuves de toutes les creatures bienheureuses, quand elles seront venues à leur perfection dans le systeme des etoiles. Leibnitz dans la Theodicee, part. i. § 19., where happy spirits hold, Beyond this concave heaven, their calm abode; And fields of radiance, whose unfading light It was a notion of the great Mr. Huygens, that there may be fixed stars at such a distance from our solar system, as that their light should not have had time to reach us, even from the creation of the world to this day. Has travell'd the profound six thousand years, Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things. Even on the barriers of the world untir'd She meditates the eternal depth below; Till half recoiling, down the headlong steep She plunges; soon o'erwhelm'd and swallow'd up In that immense of being. There her hopes Rest at the sated goal. For from the birth Of mortal man, the sovran maker said, That not in humble nor in brief delight, Not in the fading echoes of renown, Power's purple robes, nor pleasure's flowery lap, The soul should find enjoyment: but from these Turning disdainful to an equal good, Through all the ascent of things inlarge her view, Till every bound at length should disappear, And infinite perfection close the scene. Call now to mind what high capacious powers Lie folded up in man; how far beyond The praise of mortals, may the eternal growth Of nature to perfection half divine, Expand the blooming soul? What pity then Should sloth's unkindly fogs depress to earth Her tender blossom; choak the streams of life, And blast her spring! Far otherwise design'd Almighty wisdom; nature's happy cares The obedient heart far otherwise incline. Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknown Strikes the quick sense, and wakes each active power To brisker measures: witness the neglect It is here said, that in consequence of the love of novelty, objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind, lose that effect by repeated attention to them. But the instance of habit is opposed to this observation; for there, objects at first distasteful are in time rendered intirely agreeable by repeated attention. The difficulty in this case will be removed, if we consider, that, when objects at first agreeable, lose that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly passive, and the perception involuntary; but habit, on the other hand, generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it: so that the pleasure arises here not from the object, but from the mind's conscious determination of its own activity; and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination. It will still be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all. In this case, the appearance must be accounted for, one of these ways. The pleasure from habit may be merely negative. The object at first gave uneasiness: this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar: and the mind, finding it at last intirely removed, reckons its situation really pleasurable, compared with what it had experienced before. The dislike conceived of the object at first, might be owing to prejudice or want of attention. Consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often, may at length perceive its own mistake, and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion. In which case, a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury, by running toward the other extreme of fondness and attachment. Or lastly, though the object itself should always continue disagreeable, yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an association may arise in the mind, and the object never be remembered without those pleasing circumstances attending it; by which means the disagreeable impression which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated. Of all familiar prospects, though beheld With transport once; the fond attentive gaze Of young astonishment; the sober zeal Of age, commenting on prodigious things. For such the bounteous providence of heaven, In every breast implanting this desire These two ideas are oft confounded; though it is evident the mere novelty of an object makes it agreeable, even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder: whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty, being never excited by common or well-known appearances. But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause, the acquisition of knowledge and inlargement of our views of nature: on this account, it is natural to treat of them together. Of objects new and strange, to urge us on With unremitted labour to pursue Those sacred stores that wait the ripening soul, In Truth's exhaustless bosom. What need words To paint its power? For this the daring youth Breaks from his weeping mother's anxious arms, In foreign climes to rove: the pensive sage, Heedless of sleep, or midnight's harmful damp, Hangs o'er the sickly taper; and untir'd The virgin follows, with inchanted step, The mazes of some wild and wondrous tale, From morn to eve; unmindful of her form, Unmindful of the happy dress that stole The wishes of the youth, when every maid With envy pin'd. Hence, finally, by night The village-matron, round the blazing hearth, Suspends the infant-audience with her tales, Breathing astonishment! of witching rhimes, And evil spirits; of the death-bed call Of him who robb'd the widow, and devour'd The orphan's portion; of unquiet souls Risen from the grave to ease the heavy guilt Of deeds in life conceal'd; of shapes that walk At dead of night, and clank their chains, and wave The torch of hell around the murderer's bed. At every solemn pause the croud recoil Gazing each other speechless, and congeal'd With shivering sighs: till eager for the event, Around the beldame all arrect they hang, Each trembling heart with grateful terrors quell'd. But lo! disclos'd in all her smiling pomp, Where Beauty onward moving claims the verse Her charms inspire: the freely-flowing verse In thy immortal praise, o form divine, Smooths her mellifluent stream. Thee, Beauty, thee The regal dome, and thy enlivening ray The mossy roofs adore: thou, better sun! For ever beamest on the enchanted heart Love, and harmonious wonder, and delight Poetic. Brightest progeny of heaven! How shall i trace thy features? where select The roseate hues to emulate thy bloom? Haste then, my song, through nature's wide expanse, Haste then, and gather all her comeliest wealth, Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains, Whate'er the waters, or the liquid air, To deck thy lovely labour. Wilt thou fly With laughing Autumn to the Atlantic isles, And range with him the Hesperian field, and see Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove, The branches shoot with gold; where'er his step Marks the glad soil, the tender clusters grow With purple ripeness, and invest each hill As with the blushes of an evening sky? Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plume, Where gliding through his daughter's honour'd shades, The smooth Penéus from his glassy flood Reflects purpureal Tempe's pleasant scene? Fair Tempe! haunt belov'd of sylvan powers, Of Nymphs and Fauns; where in the golden age They play'd in secret on the shady brink With ancient Pan: while round their choral steps Young Hours and genial Gales with constant hand Shower'd blossoms, odours, shower'd ambrosial dews, And spring's Elysian bloom. Her flowery store To thee nor Tempe shall refuse; nor watch Of winged Hydra guard Hesperian fruits From thy free spoil. O bear then, unreprov'd, Thy smiling treasures to the green recess Where young Dione stays. With sweetest airs Intice her sorth to lend her angel-form For Beauty's honour'd image. Hither turn Thy graceful footsteps; hither, gentle maid, Incline thy polish'd forehead: let thy eyes Effuse the mildness of their azure dawn; And may the fanning breezes waft aside Thy radiant locks: disclosing, as it bends With airy softness from the marble neck, The cheek fair-blooming, and the rosy lip, Where winning smiles and pleasures sweet as love, With sanctity and wisdom, tempering blend Their soft allurement. Then the pleasing force Of nature, and her kind parental care Worthier i'd sing: then all the enamour'd youth, With each admiring virgin, to my lyre Should throng attentive, while i point on high Where Beauty's living image, like the morn That wakes in Zephyr's arms the blushing May, Moves onward; or as Venus, when she stood Effulgent on the pearly car, and smil'd, Fresh from the deep, and conscious of her form, To see the Tritons tune their vocal shells, And each cœrulean sister of the flood With loud acclaim attend her o'er the waves, To seek the Idalian bower. Ye smiling band Of youths and virgins, who through all the maze Of young desire with rival-steps pursue This charm of beauty; if the pleasing toil Can yield a moment's respite, hither turn Your favourable ear, and trust my words. I do not mean to wake the gloomy form Of Superstition dress'd in Wisdom's garb, To damp your tender hopes; i do not mean To bid the jealous thunderer fire the heavens, Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth To fright you from your joys, my cheerful song With better omens calls you to the field, Pleas'd with your generous ardour in the chace, And warm like you. Then tell me, for ye know, Does beauty ever deign to dwell where health And active use are strangers? Is her charm Confess'd in aught, whose most peculiar ends Are lame and fruitless? Or did nature mean This pleasing call the herald of a lye; To hide the shame of discord and disease, And catch with fair hypocrisy the heart Of idle faith? O no! with better cares The indulgent mother, conscious how infirm Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill, By this illustrious image, in each kind Still most illustrious where the object holds Its native powers most perfect, she by this Illumes the headstrong impulse of desire, And sanctifies his choice. The generous glebe Whose bosom smiles with verdure, the clear tract Of streams delicious to the thirsty soul, The bloom of nectar'd fruitage ripe to sense, And every charm of animated things, Are only pledges of a state sincere, The integrity and order of their frame, When all is well within, and every end Accomplish'd. Thus was beauty sent from heaven, The lovely ministress of truth and good In this dark world: for truth and good are one, Do you imagine, says Socrates to Aristippus, that what is good is not beautiful? Have you not observed that these appearances always coincide? Virtue, for instance, in the same respect as to which we call it good, is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also. In the characters of men we always This the Athenians did in a peculiar manner, by the word ??????????, ??????????. join the two denominations together. The beauty of human bodies corresponds, in like manner, with that œconomy of parts which constitutes them good; and in every circumstance of life, the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good, inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed. Xenophont. Memorab. Socrat. l. iii. c. 8. This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy; see the Characteristicks, vol. ii. p. 339 and 422. and vol. iii. p. 181. And another ingenious author has particularly shewn, that it holds in the general laws of nature, in the works of art, and the conduct of the sciences. Inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue, Treat. i. § 8. As to the connection between beauty and truth, there are two opinions concerning it. Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature, in consequencce of which all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions, and deformity in the contrary. And this necessity being supposed the same with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding, it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth. But others there are, who believe beauty to be merely a relative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent provision in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves, that so we might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without staying to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects; but that it is not impossible, in a physical sense, that two beings, of equal capacities for truth, should perceive, one of them beauty, and the other deformity, in the same proportions. And upon this supposition, by that truth which is always connected with beauty, nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which, after careful examination, the beauty of that species is found to depend. Polycletus, for instance, a famous ancient sculptor, from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies, deduced a canon or system of proportions, which was the rule of all succeeding artists. Suppose a statue modelled according to this: a man of mere natural taste, upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confesses and admires its beauty; whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and, without attending to its beauty, pronounces the workmanship to be just and true. And beauty dwells in them, and they in her, With like participation. Wherefore then, O sons of earth! would ye dissolve the tye? O wherefore, with a rash impetuous aim, Seek ye those flowery joys with which the hand Of lavish fancy paints each flattering scene Where beauty seems to dwell, nor once inquire Where is the sanction of eternal truth, Or where the seal of undeceitful good, To save your search from folly! Wanting these, Lo! beauty withers in your void embrace, And with the glittering of an idiot's toy Did fancy mock your vows. Nor let the gleam Of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts, Be chill'd or clouded at this awful task, To learn the lore of undeceitful good, And truth eternal. Though the poisonous charms Of baleful superstition guide the feet Of servile numbers, through a dreary way To their abode, through desarts, thorns and mire; And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn To muse at last, amid the ghostly gloom Of graves, and hoary vaults, and cloister'd cells; To walk with spectres through the midnight shade, And to the screaming owl's accursed song Attune the dreadful workings of his heart; Yet be not ye dismay'd. A gentler star Your lovely search illumines. From the grove Where wisdom talk'd with her Athenian sons, Could my ambitious hand intwine a wreath Of Plato's olive with the Mantuan bay, Then should my powerful verse at once dispell Those monkish horrors: then in light divine Disclose the Elysian prospect, where the steps Of those whom nature charms, through blooming walks, Through fragrant mountains and poetic streams, Amid the train of sages, heroes, bards, Led by their winged Genius and the choir Of laurell'd science and harmonious art, Proceed exulting to the eternal shrine, Where truth conspicuous with her sister-twins, The undivided partners of her sway, With good and beauty reigns. O let not us, Lull'd by luxurious pleasure's languid strain, Or crouching to the frowns of bigot-rage, O let us not a moment pause to join That godlike band. And if the gracious power Who first awaken'd my untutor'd song, Will to my invocation breathe anew The tuneful spirit; then through all our paths, Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyre Be wanting; whether on the rosy mead, When summer smiles, to warn the melting heart Of luxury's allurement; whether firm Against the torrent and the stubborn hill To urge bold virtue's unremitted nerve, And wake the strong divinity of soul That conquers chance and fate; or whether struck For sounds of triumph, to proclaim her toils Upon the lofty summit, round her brow To twine the wreath of incorruptive praise; To trace her hallow'd light through future worlds, And bless heaven's image in the heart of man. Thus with a faithful aim have we presum'd, Adventurous, to delineate nature's form; Whether in vast, majestic pomp array'd, Or drest for pleasing wonder, or serene In beauty's rosy smile. It now remains, Through various being's fair-proportion'd scale, To trace the rising lustre of her charms, From their first twilight, shining forth at length To full meridian splendour. Of degree The least and lowliest, in the effusive warmth Of colours mingling with a random blaze, Doth beauty dwell. Then higher in the line And variation of determin'd shape, Where truth's eternal measures mark the bound Of circle, cube, or sphere. The third ascent Unites this varied symmetry of parts With colour's bland allurement; as the pearl Shines in the concave of its azure bed, And painted shells indent their speckled wreath. Then more attractive rise the blooming forms Through which the breath of nature has infus'd Her genial power to draw with pregnant veins Nutritious moisture from the bounteous earth, In fruit and seed prolific: thus the flowers Their purple honours with the spring resume; And such the stately tree which autumn bends With blushing treasures. But more lovely still Is nature's charm, where to the full consent Of complicated members, to the bloom Of colour, and the vital change of growth, Life's holy flame and piercing sense are given, And active motion speaks the temper'd soul: So moves the bird of Juno; so the steed With rival ardour beats the dusty plain, And faithful dogs with eager airs of joy Salute their fellows. Thus doth beauty dwell There most conspicuous, even in outward shape, Where dawns the high expression of a mind: By steps conducting our inraptur'd search To that eternal origin, whose power, Through all the unbounded symmetry of things, Like rays effulging from the parent sun, This endless mixture of her charms diffus'd. Mind, mind alone, (bear witness, earth and heaven!) The living fountains in itself contains Of beauteous and sublime: here hand in hand, Sit paramount the Graces; here inthron'd, Cœlestial Venus, with divinest airs, Invites the soul to never-fading joy. Look then abroad through nature, to the range Of planets, suns, and adamantine spheres Wheeling unshaken through the void immense; And speak, o man! does this capacious scene With half that kindling majesty dilate Thy strong conception, as when Brutus rose Cicero himself describes this fact—Cæsare interfecto—statim cruentum altè extolleus M. Brutus pugionem, Ciceronem nominatim exclamavit, atque ei recuperatam libertatem est gratulatus. Cic. Philipp. ii. 12. Refulgent from the stroke of Cæsar's fate, Amid the croud of patriots; and his arm Aloft extending, like eternal Jove When guilt brings down the thunder, call'd aloud On Tully's name, and shook his crimson steel, And bade the father of his country, hail! For lo! the tyrant prostrate on the dust, And Rome again is free! Is aught so fair In all the dewy landscapes of the spring, In the bright eye of Hesper or the morn, In nature's fairest forms, is aught so fair As virtuous friendship? as the candid blush Of him who strives with fortune to be just? The graceful tear that streams for others woes? Or the mild majesty of private life, Where peace with ever-blooming olive crowns The gate; where honour's liberal hands effuse Unenvied treasures, and the snowy wings Of innocence and love protect the scene? Once more search, undismay'd, the dark profound Where nature works in secret; view the beds Of mineral treasure, and the eternal vault That bounds the hoary ocean; trace the forms Of atoms moving with incessant change Their elemental round; behold the seeds Of being, and the energy of life Kindling the mass with ever-active flame: Then to the secrets of the working mind Attentive turn; from dim oblivion call Her fleet, ideal band; and bid them, go! Break through time's barrier, and o'ertake the hour That saw the heavens created: then declare If aught were found in those external scenes To move thy wonder now. For what are all The forms which brute, unconscious matter wears, Greatness of bulk, or symmetry of parts? Not reaching to the heart, soon feeble grows The superficial impulse; dull their charms, And satiate soon, and pall the languid eye. Not so the moral species, nor the powers Of genius and design; the ambitious mind There sees herself: by these congenial forms Touch'd and awaken'd, with intenser act She bends each nerve, and meditates well-pleas'd Her features in the mirror. For of all The inhabitants of earth, to man alone Creative wisdom gave to lift his eye To truth's eternal measures; thence to frame The sacred laws of action and of will, Discerning justice from unequal deeds, And temperance from folly. But beyond This energy of truth, whose dictates bind Assenting reason, the benignant sire, To deck the honour'd paths of just and good, Has added bright imagination's rays: Where virtue, rising from the awful depth According to the opinion of those who assert moral obligation to be founded on an immutable and universal law, and that which is usually called the moral sense, to be determined by the peculiar temper of the imagination and the earliest associations of ideas. Of truth's mysterious bosom, doth forsake The unadorn'd condition of her birth; And dress'd by fancy in ten thousand hues, Assumes a various feature, to attract, With charms responsive to each gazer's eye, The hearts of men. Amid his rural walk, The ingenuous youth, whom solitude inspires With purest wishes, from the pensive shade Beholds her moving, like a virgin-muse That wakes her lyre to some indulgent theme Of harmony and wonder: while among The herd of servile minds, her strenuous form Indignant flashes on the patriot's eye, And through the rolls of memory appeals To ancient honour, or in act serene, Yet watchful, raises the majestic sword Of public power, from dark ambition's reach To guard the sacred volume of the laws. Genius of ancient Greece! whose faithful steps Well-pleas'd i follow through the sacred paths Of nature and of science; nurse divine Of all heroic deeds and fair desires! O! let the breath of thy extended praise Inspire my kindling bosom to the height Of this untempted theme. Nor be my thoughts Presumptuous counted, if amid the calm That sooths this vernal evening into smiles, I steal impatient from the sordid haunts Of strife and low ambition, to attend Thy sacred presence in the sylvan shade, By their malignant footsteps ne'er profan'd. Descend, propitious! to my favour'd eye; Such in thy mien, thy warm, exalted air, As when the Persian tyrant, foil'd and stung With shame and desperation, gnash'd his teeth To see thee rend the pageants of his throne; And at the lightning of thy lifted spear Crouch'd like a slave. Bring all thy martial spoils, Thy palms, thy laurels, thy triumphal songs, Thy smiling band of arts, thy godlike sires Of civil wisdom, thy heroic youth Warm from the schools of glory. Guide my way Through fair Lycéum's The school of Aristotle. walk, the green retreats Of Academus The school of Plato., and the thymy vale, Where oft inchanted with Socratic sounds, Ilissus One of the rivers on which Athens was situated. Plato, in some of his finest dialogues, lays the scene of the conversation with Socrates on its banks. pure devolv'd his tuneful stream In gentler murmurs. From the blooming store Of these auspicious fields, may i unblam'd Transplant some living blossoms to adorn My native clime: while far above the flight Of fancy's plume aspiring, i unlock The springs of ancient wisdom; while i join Thy name, thrice honour'd! with the immortal praise Of nature, while to my compatriot youth I point the high example of thy sons, And tune to Attic themes the British lyre. END OF BOOK I. BOOK THE SECOND. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. THE separation of the works of imagination from philosophy, the cause of their abuse among the moderns. Prospect of their re-union under the influence of public liberty. Enumeration of accidental pleasures, which increase the effect of objects delightful to the imagination. The pleasures of sense. Particular circumstances of the mind. Discovery of truth. Perception of contrivance and design. Emotion of the passions. All the natural passions partake of a pleasing sensation; with the final cause of this constitution illustrated by an allegorical vision, and exemplified in sorrow, pity, terror, and indignation. When shall the laurel and the vocal string Resume their honours? When shall we behold The tuneful tongue, the Promethéan hand Aspire to ancient praise? Alas! how faint, How slow the dawn of beauty and of truth Breaks the reluctant shades of Gothic night Which yet involve the nations! Long they groan'd Beneath the furies of rapacious force; Oft as the gloomy north, with iron-swarms Tempestuous pouring from her frozen caves, Blasted the Italian shore, and swept the works Of liberty and wisdom down the gulph Of all-devouring night. As long immur'd In noon-tide darkness by the glimmering lamp, Each muse and each fair science pin'd away The sordid hours: while foul, barbarian hands Their mysteries profan'd, unstrung the lyre, And chain'd the soaring pinion down to earth. At last the muses rose, and spurn'd their bonds, About the age of Hugh Capet, founder of the third race of French kings, the poets of Provence were in high reputation; a sort of strolling bards or rhapsodists, who went about the courts of princes and noblemen, entertaining them at festivals with music and poetry. They attempted both the epic, ode, and satire; and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable, partly allegorical, and partly founded on traditionary legends of the Saracen wars. These were the rudiments of Italian poetry. But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous, as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times; such as Boiardo, Bernardo Tasso, Ariosto, &amp;c. And wildly warbling, scatter'd, as they flew, Their blooming wreaths from fair Valclusa's The famous retreat of Franciso Petrarcha, the father of Italian poetry, and his mistress Laura, a lady of Avignon. bowers To Arno's The river which runs by Florence, the birth-place of Dante and Boccacio. myrtle border and the shore Of soft Parthenope Or Naples, the birth-place of Sannazaro. The great Torquato Tasso was born at Sorrento in the kingdom of Naples.. But still the rage This relates to the cruel wars among the republics of Italy, and abominable politics of its little princes, about the fifteenth century. These at last, in conjunction with the papal power, intirely extinguished the spirit of liberty in that country, and established that abuse of the fine arts which has been since propagated over all Europe. Of dire ambition and gigantic power, From public aims and from the busy walk Of civil commerce, drove the bolder train Of penetrating science to the cells, Where studious ease consumes the silent hour In shadowy searches and unfruitful care. Thus from their guardians torn, the tender arts Nor were they only losers by the separation. For philosophy itself, to use the words of a noble philosopher, being thus severed by the sprightly arts and sciences, must consequently grow dronish, insipid, pedantic, useless, and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world. Insomuch that a gentleman, says another excellent writer, cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form: so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of antiquity, and their recreation after the hurry of public affairs! From this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination; and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in England within these few years. It is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the Revolution, when Locke stood at the head of one party, and Dryden of the other. But the general spirit of liberty, which has ever since been growing, naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion gave them with the people, by applying them to subjects of importance to society. Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable; and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their embellishments, in order even to gain audience with the public. Of mimic fancy and harmonious joy, To priestly domination and the lust Of lawless courts, their amiable toil For three inglorious ages have resign'd, In vain reluctant: and Torquato's tongue Was tun'd for slavish pæans at the throne Of tinsel pomp: and Raphael's magic hand Effus'd its fair creation to enchant The fond adoring herd in Latian fanes To blind belief; while on their prostrate necks The sable tyrant plants his heel secure. But now behold! the radiant æra dawns, When freedom's ample fabric, fix'd at length For endless years on Albion's happy shore In full proportion, once more shall extend To all the kindred powers of social bliss A common mansion, a parental roof. There shall the virtues, there shall wisdom's train, Their long-lost friends rejoining, as of old, Embrace the smiling family of arts, The muses and the graces. Then no more Shall vice, distracting their delicious gifts To aims abhorr'd, with high distaste and scorn Turn from their charms the philosophic eye, The patriot-bosom; then no more the paths Of public care or intellectual toil, Alone by footsteps haughty and severe In gloomy state be trod: the harmonious Muse And her persuasive sisters then shall plant Their sheltering laurels o'er the bleak ascent, And scatter flowers along the rugged way. Arm'd with the lyre, already have we dar'd To pierce divine philosophy's retreats, And teach the Muse her lore; already strove Their long-divided honours to unite, While tempering this deep argument we sang Of truth and beauty. Now the same glad task Impends; now urging our ambitious toil, We hasten to recount the various springs Of adventitious pleasure, which adjoin Their grateful influence to the prime effect Of objects grand or beauteous, and inlarge The complicated joy. The sweets of sense, Do they not oft with kind accession flow, To raise harmonious fancy's native charm? So while we taste the fragrance of the rose, Glows not her blush the fairer? While we view Amid the noontide walk a limpid rill Gush through the trickling herbage, to the thirst Of summer yielding the delicious draught Of cool refreshment; o'er the mossy brink Shines not the surface clearer, and the waves With sweeter music murmur as they flow? Nor this alone; the various lot of life Oft from external circumstance assumes A moment's disposition to rejoice In those delights which at a different hour Would pass unheeded. Fair the face of spring, When rural songs and odours wake the morn, To every eye; but how much more to his Round whom the bed of sickness long diffus'd Its melancholy gloom! how doubly fair, When first with fresh-born vigour he inhales The balmy breeze, and feels the blessed sun Warm at his bosom, from the springs of life Chasing oppressive damps and languid pain! Or shall i mention, where cœlestial truth Her awful light discloses, to bestow A more majestic pomp on beauty's frame? For man loves knowledge, and the beams of truth More welcome touch his understanding's eye, Than all the blandishments of sound his ear, Than all of taste his tongue. Nor ever yet The melting rainbow's vernal-tinctur'd hues To me have shone so pleasing, as when first The hand of science pointed out the path In which the sun-beams gleaming from the west Fall on the watry cloud, whose darksome veil Involves the orient; and that trickling shower Piercing through every crystalline convex Of clustering dew-drops to their flight oppos'd, Recoil at length where concave all behind The internal surface of each glassy orb Repells their forward passage into air; That thence direct they seek the radiant goal From which their course began; and, as they strike In different lines the gazer's obvious eye, Assume a different lustre, through the brede Of colours changing from the splendid rose To the pale violet's dejected hue. Or shall we touch that kind access of joy, That springs to each fair object, while we trace Through all its fabric, wisdom's artful aim Disposing every part, and gaining still By means proportion'd her benignant end? Speak, ye, the pure delight, whose favour'd steps The lamp of science through the jealous maze Of nature guides, when haply you reveal Her secret honours: whether in the sky, The beauteous laws of light, the central powers That wheel the pensile planets round the year; Whether in wonders of the rowling deep, Or the rich fruits of all-sustaining earth, Or fine-adjusted springs of life and sense, Ye scan the counsels of their author's hand. What, when to raise the meditated scene, The flame of passion, through the struggling soul Deep-kindled, shows across that sudden blaze The object of its rapture, vast of size, With fiercer colours and a night of shade? What? like a storm from their capacious bed The sounding seas o'erwhelming, when the might Of these eruptions, working from the depth Of man's strong apprehension, shakes his frame Even to the base; from every naked sense Of pain or pleasure dissipating all Opinion's feeble coverings, and the veil Spun from the cobweb fashion of the times To hide the feeling heart? Then nature speaks Her genuine language, and the words of men, Big with the very motion of their souls, Declare with what accumulated force, The impetuous nerve of passion urges on The native weight and energy of things. Yet more: her honours where nor beauty claims, Nor shews of good the thirsty sense allure, From passion's power alone our nature holds This very mysterious kind of pleasure, which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful, has been taken notice of by several authors. Lucretius resolves it into self-love: Suave mari magno, &amp;c. lib. ii. 1. As if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy, without a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy, yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety. The ingenious author of the Reflections critiques sur la poesie &amp; sur la peinture, accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity, and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and inattentive state: and this, joined with the moral approbation of its own temper, which attends these emotions when natural and just, is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure, which, as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic, deserved a very particular consideration in this poem. Essential pleasure. Passion's fierce illapse Rouzes the mind's whole fabric; with supplies Of daily impulse keeps the elastic powers Intensely poiz'd, and polishes anew By that collision all the fine machine: Else rust would rise, and foulness, by degrees Incumbering, choak at last what heaven design'd For ceaseless motion and a round of toil. —But say, does every passion thus to man Administer delight? That name indeed Becomes the rosy breath of love; becomes The radiant smiles of joy, the applauding hand Of admiration: but the bitter shower That sorrow sheds upon a brother's grave, But the dumb palsy of nocturnal fear, Or those consuming fires that gnaw the heart Of panting indignation, find we there To move delight?—Then listen while my tongue The unalter'd will of heaven with faithful awe Reveals; what old Harmodius wont to teach My early age; Harmodius, who had weigh'd Within his learned mind whate'er the schools Of wisdom, or thy lonely-whispering voice, O faithful nature! dictate of the laws Which govern and support this mighty frame Of universal being. Oft the hours From morn to eve have stolen unmark'd away, While mute attention hung upon his lips, As thus the sage his awful tale began. 'Twas in the windings of an ancient wood, When spotless youth with solitude resigns To sweet philosophy the studious day, What time pale autumn shades the silent eve, Musing i rov'd. Of good and evil much, And much of mortal man my thought revolv'd; When starting full on fancy's gushing eye The mournful image of Parthenia's fate, That hour, o long belov'd and long deplor'd! When blooming youth, nor gentlest wisdom's arts, Nor Hymen's honours gather'd for thy brow, Nor all thy lover's, all thy father's tears Avail'd to snatch thee from the cruel grave; Thy agonizing looks, thy last farewel Struck to the inmost feeling of my soul As with the hand of death. At once the shade More horrid nodded o'er me, and the winds With hoarser murmuring shook the branches. Dark As midnight storms, the scene of human things Appear'd before me; desarts, burning sands, Where the parch'd adder dies; the frozen south, And desolation blasting all the west With rapine and with murder: tyrant power Here sits enthron'd with blood; the baleful charms Of superstition there infect the skies, And turn the sun to horror. Gracious heaven! What is the life of man? Or cannot these, Not these portents thy awful will suffice? That, propagated thus beyond their scope, They rise to act their cruelties anew In my afflicted bosom, thus decreed The universal sensitive of pain, The wretched heir of evils not its own! Thus i impatient; when, at once effus'd, A flashing torrent of cœlestial day Burst through the shadowy void. With slow descent A purple cloud came floating through the sky, And pois'd at length within the circling trees, Hung obvious to my view; till opening wide Its lucid orb, a more than human form Emerging lean'd majestic o'er my head, And instant thunder shook the conscious grove. Then melted into air the liquid cloud, And all the shining vision stood reveal'd. A wreath of palm his ample forehead bound, And o'er his shoulder, mantling to his knee, Flow'd the transparent robe, around his waist Collected with a radiant zone of gold Æthereal: there in mystic signs ingrav'd, I read his office high and sacred name, Genius of human kind. Appall'd i gaz'd The godlike presence; for athwart his brow Displeasure, temper'd with a mild concern, Look'd down reluctant on me, and his words Like distant thunders broke the murmuring air. Vain are thy thoughts, o child of mortal birth! And impotent thy tongue. Is thy short span Capacious of this universal frame? Thy wisdom all-sufficient? Thou, alas! Dost thou aspire to judge between the Lord Of nature and his works? to lift thy voice Against the sovran order he decreed, All good and lovely? to blaspheme the bands Of tenderness innate and social love, Holiest of things! by which the general orb Of being, as by adamantine links, Was drawn to perfect union and sustain'd From everlasting? Hast thou felt the pangs Of softening sorrow, of indignant zeal So grievous to the soul, as thence to wish The ties of nature broken from thy frame; That so thy selfish, unrelenting heart Might cease to mourn its lot, no longer then The wretched heir of evils not its own? O fair benevolence of generous minds! O man by nature form'd for all mankind! He spoke; abash'd and silent i remain'd, As conscious of my tongue's offence, and aw'd Before his presence, though my secret soul Disdain'd the imputation. On the ground I fix'd my eyes; till from his airy couch He stoop'd sublime, and touching with his hand My dazling forehead, Raise thy sight, he cry'd And let thy sense convince thy erring tongue. I look'd, and lo! the former scene was chang'd; For verdant alleys and surrounding trees, A solitary prospect, wide and wild, Rush'd on my senses. 'Twas an horrid pile Of hills with many a shaggy forest mix'd, With many a sable cliff and glittering stream. Aloft recumbent o'er the hanging ridge, The brown woods wav'd; while ever-trickling springs Wash'd from the naked roots of oak and pine The crumbling soil; and still at every fall Down the steep windings of the channel'd rock, Remurmuring rush'd the congregated floods With hoarser inundation; till at last They reach'd a grassy plain, which from the skirts Of that high desart spread her verdant lap, And drank the gushing moisture, where confin'd In one smooth current, o'er the lilied vale Clearer than glass it flow'd. Autumnal spoils Luxuriant spreading to the rays of morn, Blush'd o'er the cliffs, whose half-incircling mound As in a sylvan theatre inclos'd That flowery level. On the river's brink I spy'd a fair pavilion, which diffus'd Its floating umbrage 'mid the silver shade Of osiers. Now the western sun reveal'd Between two parting cliffs his golden orb, And pour'd across the shadow of the hills, On rocks and floods, a yellow stream of light That cheer'd the solemn scene. My listening powers Were aw'd, and every thought in silence hung, And wondering expectation. Then the voice Of that cœlestial power, the mystic show Declaring, thus my deep attention call'd. Inhabitant of earth, to whom is given The account of the œconomy of providence here introduced, as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind when under the compunction of private evils, seems to have come originally from the Pythagorean school: but of the ancient philosophers, Plato has most largely insisted upon it, has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding, and ennobled it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination. He has one passage so full and clear on this head, that I am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see it here, though somewhat long. Addressing himself to such as are not satisfied concerning divine providence: The Being who presides over the whole, says he, has disposed and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole, every part of which, according to the extent of its influence, does and suffers what is fit and proper. One of these parts is yours, O unhappy man, which though in itself most inconsiderable and minute, yet being connected with the universe, ever seeks to co-operate with that supreme order. You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence, that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy; existing, as it does, not for your sake, but the cause and reason of your existence, which, as in the symmetry of every artificial work, must of necessity concur with the general design of the artist, and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless; since, according to the various energy of creation, and the common laws of nature, there is a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole.—For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and self-moving creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them, considered first of all by what disposition of things, and by what situation of each individual in the general system, vice might be depressed and subdued, and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible: In this manner he ordered through the entire circle of being, the internal constitution of every mind, where should be its station in the universal fabric, and through what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence. He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution, as well for those who, by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated into the divine virtue, are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness; as of those who by the most flagitious arts have risen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power, and whom you therefore look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the gods, because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient, and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole. Plato de Leg. x. 16. This theory has been delivered of late, especially abroad, in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions; whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it, and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers. The gracious ways of providence to learn, Receive my sayings with a stedfast ear— Know then, the sovran spirit of the world, Though self-collected from eternal time, Within his own deep essence he beheld The bounds of true felicity complete; Yet by immense benignity inclin'd To spread around him that primæval joy Which fill'd himself, he rais'd his plastic arm, And sounded through the hollow depth of space The strong, creative mandate. Strait arose These heavenly orbs, the glad abodes of life Effusive kindled by his breath divine Through endless forms of being. Each inhal'd From him its portion of the vital flame, In measure such, that, from the wide complex Of coexistent orders, one might rise, See the Meditations of Antoninus and the Characteristicks, passim. One order, all-involving and intire. He too beholding in the sacred light Of his essential reason, all the shapes Of swift contingence, all successive ties Of action propagated through the sum Of possible existence, he at once, Down the long series of eventful time, So fix'd the dates of being, so dispos'd, To every living soul of every kind The field of motion and the hour of rest, That all conspir'd to his supreme design, To universal good: with full accord Answering the mighty model he had chosen, The best and fairest of unnumber'd worlds This opinion is so old, that Timæus Locrus calls the supreme being ?????????? ?? ?????????, the artificer of that which is best; and represents him as resolving in the beginning to produce the most excellent work, and as copying the world most exactly from his own intelligible and essential idea; so that it yet remains, as it was at first, perfect in beauty, and will never stand in need of any correction or improvement. There can be no room for a caution here, to understand the expressions, not of any particular circumstances of human life separately considered, but of the sum or universal system of life and being. See also the vision at the end of the Theodicée of Leibnitz. That lay from everlasting in the store Of his divine conceptions. Nor content, By one exertion of creative power His goodness to reveal; through every age, Through every moment up the tract of time His parent-hand with ever-new increase Of happiness and virtue has adorn'd The vast harmonious frame: his parent-hand, From the mute shell-fish gasping on the shore, To men, to angels, to cœlestial minds For ever leads the generations on To higher scenes of being; while supply'd From day to day with his enlivening breath, Inferior orders in succession rise To fill the void below. As flame ascends, This opinion, though not held by Plato nor any of the ancients, is yet a very natural consequence of his principles. But the disquisition is too complex and extensive to be entered upon here. As bodies to their proper center move, As the pois'd ocean to the attracting moon Obedient swells, and every headlong stream Devolves its winding waters to the main; So all things which have life aspire to God, The sun of being, boundless, unimpair'd, Center of souls! Nor does the faithful voice Of nature cease to prompt their eager steps Aright; nor is the care of heaven withheld From granting to the task proportion'd aid; That in their stations all may persevere To climb the ascent of being, and approach For ever nearer to the life divine. That rocky pile thou seest, that verdant lawn Fresh-water'd from the mountains. Let the scene Paint in thy fancy the primæval seat Of man, and where the will supreme ordain'd His mansion, that pavilion fair-diffus'd Along the shady brink; in this recess To wear the appointed season of his youth, Till riper hours should open to his toil The high communion of superior minds, Of consecrated heroes and of gods. Nor did the sire omnipotent forget His tender bloom to cherish; nor withheld Cœlestial footsteps from his green abode. Oft from the radiant honours of his throne, He sent whom most he lov'd, the sovran fair, The effluence of his glory, whom he plac'd Before his eyes for ever to behold; The goddess from whose inspiration flows The toil of patriots, the delight of friends; Without whose work divine, in heaven or earth, Nought lovely, nought propitious comes to pass, Nor hope, nor praise, nor honour. Her the sire Gave it in charge to rear the blooming mind, The folded powers to open, to direct The growth luxuriant of his young desires, And from the laws of this majestic world To teach him what was good. As thus the nymph Her daily care attended, by her side With constant steps her gay companion stay'd, The fair Euphrosyné, the gentle queen Of smiles, and graceful gladness, and delights That cheer alike the hearts of mortal men And powers immortal. See the shining pair! Behold, where from his dwelling now disclos'd They quit their youthful charge and seek the skies. I look'd, and on the flowery turf there stood Between two radiant forms a smiling youth Whose tender cheeks display'd the vernal flower Of beauty; sweetest innocence illum'd His bashful eyes, and on his polish'd brow Sate young simplicity. With fond regard He view'd the associates, as their steps they mov'd; The younger chief his ardent eyes detain'd, With mild regret invoking her return. Bright as the star of evening she appear'd Amid the dusky scene. Eternal youth O'er all her form its glowing honours breath'd; And smiles eternal from her candid eyes Flow'd, like the dewy lustre of the morn Effusive trembling on the placid waves. The spring of heaven had shed its blushing spoils To bind her sable tresses: full diffus'd Her yellow mantle floated in the breeze; And in her hand she wav'd a living branch Rich with immortal fruits, of power to calm The wrathful heart, and from the brightening eyes, To chase the cloud of sadness. More sublime The heavenly partner mov'd. The prime of age Compos'd her steps. The presence of a god, High on the circle of her brow inthron'd, From each majestic motion darted awe, Devoted awe! till, cherish'd by her looks Benevolent and meek, confiding love To filial rapture soften'd all the soul. Free in her graceful hand she pois'd the sword Of chaste dominion. An heroic crown Display'd the old simplicity of pomp Around her honour'd head. A matron's robe, White as the sunshine streams through vernal clouds, Her stately form invested. Hand in hand The immortal pair forsook the enamel'd green, Ascending slowly. Rays of limpid light Gleam'd round their path; cœlestial sounds were heard, And through the fragrant air æthereal dews Distill'd around them; till at once the clouds Disparting wide in midway sky, withdrew Their airy veil, and left a bright expanse Of empyréan flame, where spent and drown'd, Afflicted vision plung'd in vain to scan What object it involv'd. My feeble eyes Indur'd not. Bending down to earth i stood, With dumb attention. Soon a female voice, As watry murmurs sweet, or warbling shades, With sacred invocation thus began. Father of gods and mortals! whose right arm With reins eternal guides the moving heavens, Bend thy propitious ear. Behold well-pleas'd I seek to finish thy divine decree. With frequent steps I visit yonder seat Of man, thy offspring; from the tender seeds Of justice and of wisdom, to evolve The latent honours of his generous frame; Till thy conducting hand shall raise his lot From earth's dim scene to these æthereal walks, The temple of thy glory. But not me, Not my directing voice he oft requires, Or hears delighted: this inchanting maid, The associate thou hast given me, her alone He loves, o Father! absent, her he craves; And but for her glad presence ever join'd, Rejoices not in mine: that all my hopes This thy benignant purpose to fulfil, I deem uncertain; and my daily cares Unfruitful all and vain, unless by thee Still farther aided in the work divine. She ceas'd; a voice more awful thus reply'd. O thou! in whom for ever i delight, Fairer than all the inhabitants of heaven, Best image of thy author! far from thee Be disappointment, or distaste, or blame; Who soon or late shalt every work fulfil, And no resistance find. If man refuse To hearken to thy dictates; or allur'd By meaner joys, to any other power Transfer the honours due to thee alone; That joy which he pursues he ne'er shall taste, That power in whom delighteth ne'er behold. Go then, once more, and happy be thy toil; Go then! but let not this thy smiling friend Partake thy footsteps. In her stead, behold! With thee the son of Nemesis i send; The fiend abhorr'd! whose vengeance takes account Of sacred order's violated laws. See where he calls thee, burning to be gone, Fierce to exhaust the tempest of his wrath On yon devoted head. But thou, my child, Controul his cruel phrenzy, and protect Thy tender charge; that when despair shall grasp His agonizing bosom, he may learn, Then he may learn to love the gracious hand Alone sufficient in the hour of ill, To save his feeble spirit; then confess Thy genuine honours, o excelling fair! When all the plagues that wait the deadly will. Of this avenging dæmon, all the storms Of night infernal, serve but to display The energy of thy superior charms With mildest awe triumphant o'er his rage, And shining clearer in the horrid gloom. Here ceas'd that awful voice, and soon i felt The cloudy curtain of refreshing eve Was clos'd once more, from that immortal fire Sheltering my eye-lids. Looking up, i view'd A vast gigantic spectre striding on Through murmuring thunders and a waste of clouds, With dreadful action. Black as night his brow Relentless frowns involv'd. His savage limbs With sharp impatience violent he writh'd, As through convulsive anguish; and his hand, Arm'd with a scorpion-lash, full oft he rais'd In madness to his bosom; while his eyes Rain'd bitter tears, and bellowing loud he shook The void with horror. Silent by his side The virgin came. No discomposure stirr'd Her features. From the glooms which hung around No stain of darkness mingled with the beam Of her divine effulgence. Now they stoop Upon the river-bank; and now to hail His wonted guests, with eager steps advanc'd The unsuspecting inmate of the shade. As when a famish'd wolf, that all night long Had rang'd the Alpine snows, by chance at morn Sees from a cliff incumbent o'er the smoke Of some lone village, a neglected kid That strays along the wild for herb or spring; Down from the winding ridge he sweeps amain, And thinks he tears him: so with tenfold rage, The monster sprung remorseless on his prey. Amaz'd the stripling stood: with panting breast Feebly he pour'd the lamentable wail Of helpless consternation, struck at once, And rooted to the ground. The queen beheld His terror, and with looks of tenderest care Advanc'd to save him. Soon the tyrant felt Her awful power. His keen, tempestuous arm Hung nerveless, nor descended where his rage Had aim'd the deadly blow: then dumb retir'd With sullen rancour. Lo! the sovran maid Folds with a mother's arms the fainting boy, Till life rekindles in his rosy cheek; Then grasps his hands, and cheers him with her tongue. O wake thee, rouze thy spirit! Shall the spite Of yon tormentor thus appall thy heart, While i, thy friend and guardian, am at hand To rescue and to heal? O let thy soul Remember, what the will of heaven ordains Is ever good for all; and if for all, Then good for thee. Nor only by the warmth And soothing sunshine of delightful things, Do minds grow up and flourish. Oft misled By that bland light, the young unpractis'd views Of reason wander through a fatal road, Far from their native aim: as if to lye Inglorious in the fragrant shade, and wait The soft access of ever-circling joys, Were all the end of being. Ask thyself, This pleasing error did it never lull Thy wishes? Has thy constant heart refus'd The silken fetters of delicious ease? Or when divine Euphrosyné appear'd Within this dwelling, did not thy desires Hang far below the measure of thy fate, Which i reveal'd before thee? and thy eyes, Impatient of my counsels, turn away To drink the soft effusion of her smiles? Know then, for this the everlasting sire Deprives thee of her presence, and instead, O wise and still benevolent! ordains This horrid visage hither to pursue My steps; that so thy nature may discern Its real good, and what alone can save Thy feeble spirit in this hour of ill From folly and despair. O yet belov'd! Let not this headlong terror quite o'erwhelm Thy scatter'd powers; nor fatal deem the rage Of this tormentor, nor his proud assault, While i am here to vindicate thy toil, Above the generous question of thy arm. Brave by thy fears and in thy weakness strong, This hour he triumphs: but confront his might, And dare him to the combat, then with ease Disarm'd and quell'd, his fierceness he resigns To bondage and to scorn: while thus inur'd By watchful danger, by unceasing toil, The immortal mind, superior to his fate, Amid the outrage of external things, Firm as the solid base of this great world, Rests on his own foundations. Blow, ye winds! Ye waves! ye thunders! rowl your tempest on; Shake, ye old pillars of the marble sky! Till all its orbs and all its worlds of fire Be loosen'd from their seats; yet still serene, The unconquer'd mind looks down upon the wreck; And ever stronger as the storms advance, Firm through the closing ruin holds his way, Where nature calls him to the destin'd goal. So spake the goddess; while through all her frame Cœlestial raptures flow'd, in every word, In every motion kindling warmth divine To seize who listen'd. Vehement and swift As lightening fires the aromatic shade In Æthiopian fields, the stripling felt Her inspiration catch his fervid soul, And starting from his languor thus exclaim'd. Then let the trial come! and witness thou, If terror be upon me; if i shrink To meet the storm, or faulter in my strength When hardest it besets me. Do not think That i am fearful and infirm of soul, As late thy eyes beheld: for thou hast chang'd My nature; thy commanding voice has wak'd My languid powers to bear me boldly on, Where'er the will divine my path ordains Through toil or peril: only do not thou Forsake me; o be thou for ever near, That i may listen to thy sacred voice, And guide by thy decrees my constant feet. But say, for ever are my eyes bereft? Say, shall the fair Euphrosyné not once Appear again to charm me? Thou, in heaven! O thou eternal arbiter of things! Be thy great bidding done: for who am i, To question thy appointment? Let the frowns Of this avenger every morn o'ercast The cheerful dawn, and every evening damp With double night my dwelling; i will learn To hail them both, and unrepining bear His hateful presence: but permit my tongue One glad request, and if my deeds may find Thy awful eye propitious, o restore The rosy-featur'd maid; again to cheer This lonely seat, and bless me with her smiles. He spoke; when instant through the sable glooms With which that furious presence had involv'd The ambient air, a flood of radiance came Swift as the lightening flash; the melting clouds Flew diverse, and amid the blue serene Euphrosyné appear'd. With sprightly step The nymph alighted on the irriguous lawn, And to her wondering audience thus began. Lo! i am here to answer to your vows, And be the meeting fortunate! i come With joyful tidings; we shall part no more— Hark! how the gentle echo from her cell Talks through the cliffs, and murmuring o'er the stream Repeats the accents; we shall part no more. O my delightful friends! well-pleas'd on high The father has beheld you, while the might Of that stern foe with bitter trial prov'd Your equal doings; then for ever spake The high decree: that thou, cœlestial maid! Howe'er that griesly phantom on thy steps May sometimes dare intrude, yet never more Shalt thou, descending to the abode of man, Alone endure the rancour of his arm, Or leave thy lov'd Euphrosyné behind. She ended; and the whole romantic scene Immediate vanish'd; rocks, and woods, and rills, The mantling tent, and each mysterious form Flew like the pictures of a morning dream, When sun-shine fills the bed. A while i stood Perplex'd and giddy; till the radiant power Who bade the visionary landscape rise, As up to him i turn'd, with gentlest looks Preventing my enquiry, thus began. There let thy soul acknowledge its complaint How blind, how impious! There behold the ways Of heaven's eternal destiny to man, For ever just, benevolent and wise: That virtue's awful steps, howe'er pursu'd By vexing fortune and intrusive pain, Should never be divided from her chaste, Her fair attendant, pleasure. Need i urge Thy tardy thought through all the various round Of this existence, that thy softening soul At length may learn what energy the hand Of virtue mingles in the bitter tide Of passion swelling with distress and pain, To mitigate the sharp with gracious drops Of cordial pleasure? Ask the faithful youth, Why the cold urn of her whom long he lov'd So often fills his arms; so often draws His lonely footsteps at the silent hour, To pay the mournful tribute of his tears? O! he will tell thee, that the wealth of worlds Should ne'er seduce his bosom to forego That sacred hour, when, stealing from the noise Of care and envy, sweet remembrance sooths With virtue's kindest looks his aking breast, And turns his tears to rapture.—Ask the croud Which flies impatient from the village-walk To climb the neighbouring cliffs, when far below The cruel winds have hurl'd upon the coast Some helpless bark; while sacred pity melts The general eye, or terror's icy hand Smites their distorted limbs and horrent hair; While every mother closer to her breast Catches her child, and pointing where the waves Foam through the shatter'd vessel, shrieks aloud As one poor wretch that spreads his piteous arms For succour, swallow'd by the roaring surge, As now another, dash'd against the rock, Drops lifeless down: o! deemest thou indeed No kind endearment here by nature given To mutual terror and compassion's tears? No sweetly-melting softness which attracts, O'er all that edge of pain, the social powers To this their proper action and their end? —Ask thy own heart; when at the midnight hour, Slow through that studious gloom thy pausing eye Led by the glimmering taper moves around The sacred volumes of the dead, the songs Of Grecian bards, and records writ by fame For Grecian heroes, where the present power Of heaven and earth surveys the immortal page, Even as a father blessing, while he reads The praises of his son. If then thy soul, Spurning the yoke of these inglorious days, Mix in their deeds and kindle with their flame; Say, when the prospect blackens on thy view, When rooted from the base, heroic states Mourn in the dust and tremble at the frown Of curst ambition; when the pious band Of youths who fought for freedom and their sires, Lie side by side in gore; when ruffian pride Usurps the throne of justice, turns the pomp Of public power, the majesty of rule, The sword, the laurel, and the purple robe, To slavish empty pageants, to adorn A tyrant's walk, and glitter in the eyes Of such as bow the knee; when honour'd urns Of patriots and of chiefs, the awful bust And storied arch, to glut the coward-rage Of regal envy, strew the public way With hallow'd ruins; when the Muse's haunt, The marble porch where wisdom wont to talk With Socrates or Tully, hears no more, Save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks, Or female superstition's midnight prayer; When ruthless rapine from the hand of time Tears the destroying scythe, with surer blow To sweep the works of glory from their base; Till desolation o'er the grass-grown street Expands his raven-wings, and up the wall, Where senates once the price of monarchs doom'd, Hisses the gliding snake through hoary weeds That clasp the mouldering column; thus defac'd, Thus widely mournful when the prospect thrills Thy beating bosom, when the patriot's tear Starts from thine eye, and thy extended arm In fancy hurls the thunderbolt of Jove To fire the impious wreath on Philip's The Macedonian. brow, Or dash Octavius from the trophied car; Say, does thy secret soul repine to taste The big distress? Or would'st thou then exchange Those heart-ennobling sorrows for the lot Of him who sits amid the gaudy herd Of mute barbarians bending to his nod, And bears aloft his gold-invested front, And says within himself, “i am a king, “And wherefore should the clamorous voice of woe “Intrude upon mine ear?—” The baleful dregs Of these late ages, this inglorious draught Of servitude and folly, have not yet, Blest be the eternal ruler of the world! Defil'd to such a depth of sordid shame The native honours of the human soul, Nor so effac'd the image of its sire. END OF BOOK II. BOOK THE THIRD. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK. PLEASURE in observing the tempers and manners of men, even where vicious or absurd. The origin of vice, from false representations of the fancy, producing false opinions concerning good and evil. Inquiry into ridicule. The general sources of ridicule in the minds and characters of men, enumerated. Final cause of the sense of ridicule. The resemblance of certain aspects of inanimate things to the sensations and properties of the mind. The operations of the mind in the production of the works of imagination, described. The secondary pleasure from imitation. The benevolent order of the world illustrated in the arbitrary connexion of these pleasures with the objects which excite them. The nature and conduct of taste. Concluding with an account of the natural and moral advantages resulting from a sensible and well-formed imagination. What wonder therefore, since the indearing ties Of passion link the universal kind Of man so close, what wonder if to search This common nature through the various change Of sex, and age, and fortune, and the frame Of each peculiar, draw the busy mind With unresisted charms? The spacious west, And all the teeming regions of the south Hold not a quarry, to the curious flight Of knowledge, half so tempting or so fair, As man to man. Nor only where the smiles Of love invite; nor only where the applause Of cordial honour turns the attentive eye On virtue's graceful deeds. For since the course Of things external acts in different ways On human apprehensions, as the hand Of nature temper'd to a different frame. Peculiar minds; so haply where the powers The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life, is one of the most important points in moral philosophy. It were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions, and mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure. Let any man, even of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyse the idea of what he calls his interest; he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency, beauty, and order, variously combined into one system, the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labour, hazard, and self-denial. It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good; otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral order of things. If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune; it may be answered, that though no man is born ambitious or a miser, yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects, consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain passions of a particular turn. Some men, for instance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted with the vast and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination; that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world, are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral. While those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and s weetness of colours, and forms, and sounds, never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life. And this is sufficient to account for the objection. Among the ancient philosophers, though we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the Socratic school, yet the Stoics were the first who paid it a due attention. Zeno, their founder, thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life, without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things, which the imagination offers to the mind (Diog. Laërt. l. vii.) The Meditations of M. Aurelius, and the discourses of Epictetus, are full of the same sentiment; insomuch that the latter makes the ?????? ??? ??? ?????????, or right management of the fancies, the only thing for which we are accountable to providence, and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic. Arrian. l. i. c. 12. &amp; l. ii. c. 22. See also the Characteristics, vol. i. from p. 313. to 321. where this Stoical doctrine is embellished with all the elegance and graces of Plato. Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge The images of things, but paint in all Their genuine hues, the features which they wore In nature; there opinion will be true, And action right. For action treads the path In which opinion says he follows good, Or flies from evil; and opinion gives Report of good or evil, as the scene Was drawn by fancy, lovely or deform'd: Thus her report can never there be true Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye, With glaring colours and distorted lines. Is there a man, who at the sound of death Sees ghastly shapes of terror conjur'd up, And black before him; nought but death-bed groans And fearful prayers, and plunging from the brink Of light and being, down the gloomy air, An unknown depth? Alas! in such a mind, If no bright forms of excellence attend The image of his country; nor the pomp Of sacred senates, nor the guardian voice Of justice on her throne, nor aught that wakes The conscious bosom with a patriot's flame; Will not opinion tell him, that to die, Or stand the hazard, is a greater ill Than to betray his country? And in act Will he not chuse to be a wretch and live? Here vice begins then. From the inchanting cup Which fancy holds to all, the unwary thirst Of youth oft swallows a Circæan draught, That sheds a baleful tincture o'er the eye Of reason, till no longer he discerns, And only guides to err. Then revel forth A furious band that spurn him from the throne; And all is uproar. Thus ambition grasps The empire of the soul: thus pale revenge Unsheaths her murderous dagger; and the hands Of lust and rapine, with unholy arts, Watch to o'erturn the barrier of the laws That keeps them from their prey: thus all the plagues The wicked bear, or o'er the trembling scene The tragic muse discloses, under shapes Of honour, safety, pleasure, ease or pomp, Stole first into the mind. Yet not by all Those lying forms which fancy in the brain Engenders, are the kindling passions driven, To guilty deeds; nor reason bound in chains, That vice alone may lord it: oft adorn'd With solemn pageants, folly mounts the throne, And plays her idiot-anticks, like a queen. A thousand garbs she wears; a thousand ways She wheels her giddy empire.—Lo! thus far With bold adventure, to the Mantuan lyre I sing of nature's charms, and touch well-pleas'd A stricter note: now haply must my song Unbend her serious measure, and reveal In lighter strains, how folly's aukward arts Notwithstanding the general influence of ridicule on private and civil life, as well as on learning and the sciences, it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented, by divines especially. The manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature, should be precisely the same as in natural philosophy; from particular facts to investigate the stated order in which they appear, and then apply the general law, thus discovered, to the explication of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts. Excite impetuous laughter's gay rebuke; The sportive province of the comic muse. See! in what crouds the uncouth forms advance: Each would outstrip the other, each prevent Our careful search, and offer to your gaze, Unask'd, his motley features. Wait awhile, My curious friends! and let us first arrange In proper order your promiscuous throng. Behold the foremost band; of slender thought, The first and most general source of ridicule in the characters of men, is vanity, or self-applause for some desirable quality or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it. And easy faith; whom flattering fancy sooths With lying spectres, in themselves to view Illustrious forms of excellence and good, That scorn the mansion. With exulting hearts They spread their spurious treasures to the sun, And bid the world admire! but chief the glance Of wishful envy draws their joy-bright eyes, And lists with self-applause each lordly brow. In number boundless as the blooms of spring, Behold their glaring idols, empty shades By fancy gilded o'er, and then set up For adoration. Some in learning's garb, With formal band, and sable-cinctur'd gown, And rags of mouldy volumes. Some elate With martial splendor, steely pikes and swords Of costly frame, and gay Phœnician robes Inwrought with flowery gold, assume the port Of stately valour: listening by his side There stands a female form; to her, with looks Of earnest import, pregnant with amaze, He talks of deadly deeds, of breaches, storms, And sulphurous mines, and ambush: then at once Breaks off, and smiles to see her look so pale, And asks some wondering question of her fears. Others of graver mien; behold, adorn'd With holy ensigns, how sublime they move, And bending oft their sanctimonious eyes Take homage of the simple-minded throng; Ambassadors of heaven! Nor much unlike Is he whose visage, in the lazy mist That mantles every feature, hides a brood Of politic conceits; of whispers, nods, And hints deep omen'd with unwieldy schemes, And dark portents of state. Ten thousand more, Prodigious habits and tumultuous tongues, Pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band. Then comes the second order; all who seek Ridicule from the same vanity, where, though the possession be real, yet no merit can arise from it, because of some particular circumstances, which, though obvious to the spectator, are yet overlooked by the ridiculous character. The debt of praise, where watchful unbelief Darts through the thin pretence her squinting eye On some retir'd appearance which belies The boasted virtue, or annuls the applause That justice else would pay. Here side by side I see two leaders of the solemn train Approaching: one a female old and grey, With eyes demure, and wrinkle-furrow'd brow, Pale as the cheeks of death; yet still she stuns The sickening audience with a nauseous tale; How many youths her myrtle-chains have worn, How many virgins at her triumphs pin'd! Yet how resolv'd she guards her cautious heart; Such is her terror at the risques of love, And man's seducing tongue! The other seems A bearded sage, ungentle in his mien, And sordid all his habit; peevish want Grins at his heels, while down the gazing throng He stalks, resounding in magnific phrase The vanity of riches, the contempt Of pomp and power. Be prudent in your zeal, Ye grave associates! let the silent grace Of her who blushes at the fond regard Her charms inspire, more eloquent unfold The praise of spotless honour: let the man Whose eye regards not his illustrious pomp And ample store, but as indulgent streams To cheer the barren soil and spread the fruits Of joy, let him by juster measures fix The price of riches and the end of power. Another tribe succeeds; deluded long Ridicule from a notion of excellence in particular objects disproportioned to their intrinsic value, and inconsistent with the order of nature. By fancy's dazling optics, these behold The images of some peculiar things With brighter hues resplendent, and portray'd With features nobler far than e'er adorn'd Their genuine objects. Hence the fever'd heart Pants with delirious hope for tinsel charms; Hence oft obtrusive on the eye of scorn, Untimely zeal her witless pride betrays! And serious manhood from the towering aim Of wisdom, stoops to emulate the boast Of childish toil. Behold yon mystic form, Bedeck'd with feathers, insects, weeds and shells! Not with intenser view the Samian sage Bent his fixt eye on heaven's intenser fires, When first the order of that radiant scene Swell'd his exulting thought, than this surveys A muckworm's entrails or a spider's sang. Next him a youth, with flowers and myrtles crown'd, Attends that virgin form, and blushing kneels, With fondest gesture and a suppliant's tongue, To win her coy regard: adieu, for him, The dull ingagements of the bustling world! Adieu the sick impertinence of praise! And hope, and action! for with her alone, By streams and shades, to steal these sighing hours, Is all he asks, and all that fate can give! Thee too, facetious Momion, wandering here, Thee, dreaded censor, oft have i beheld Bewilder'd unawares: alas! too long Flush'd with thy comic triumphs and the spoils Of sly derision! till on every side Hurling thy random bolts, offended truth Assign'd thee here thy station with the slaves Of folly. Thy once formidable name Shall grace her humble records, and be heard In scoffs and mockery bandied from the lips Of all the vengeful brotherhood around, So oft the patient victims of thy scorn. But now, ye gay! to whom indulgent fate, Ridicule from a notion of excellence, when the object is absolutely odious or contemptible. This is the highest degree of the ridiculous; as in the affectation of diseases or vices. Of all the muse's empire hath assign'd The fields of folly, hither each advance Your sickles; here the teeming soil affords Its richest growth. A favourite brood appears; In whom the dæmon, with a mother's joy, Views all her charms reflected, all her cares At full repay'd. Ye most illustrious band! Who, scorning reason's tame, pedantic rules, And order's vulgar bondage, never meant For souls sublime as yours, with generous zeal Pay vice the reverence virtue long usurp'd, And yield deformity the fond applause Which beauty wont to claim; forgive my song, That for the blushing diffidence of youth, It shuns the unequal province of your praise. Thus far triumphant in the pleasing guile Ridicule from false shame or groundless fear. Of bland imagination, folly's train Have dar'd our search: but now a dastard-kind Advance reluctant, and with faultering feet Shrink from the gazer's eye: infeebled hearts Whom fancy chills with visionary fears, Or bends to servile tameness with conceits Of shame, of evil, or of base defect, Fantastic and delusive. Here the slave Who droops abash'd when sullen pomp surveys His humbler habit; here the trembling wretch Unnerv'd and struck with terror's icy bolts, Spent in weak wailings, drown'd in shameful tears, At every dream of danger: here subdued By frontless laughter and the hardy scorn Of old, unfeeling vice, the abject soul, Who blushing half resigns the candid praise Of temperance and honour; half disowns A freeman's hatred of tyrannic pride; And hears with sickly smiles the venal mouth With foulest licence mock the patriot's name. Last of the motley bands on whom the power Ridicule from the ignorance of such things as our circumstances require us to know. Of gay derision bends her hostile aim, Is that where shameful ignorance presides. Beneath her sordid banners, lo! they march, Like blind and lame. Whate'er their doubtful hands Attempt, confusion straight appears behind, And troubles all the work. Through many a maze, Perplex'd they struggle, changing every path, O'erturning every purpose; then at last Sit down dismay'd, and leave the entangled scene For scorn to sport with. Such then is the abode Of folly in the mind; and such the shapes In which she governs her obsequious train. Through every scene of ridicule in things To lead the tenour of my devious lay; Through every swift occasion, which the hand Of laughter points at, when the mirthful sting Distends her sallying nerves and choaks her tongue; What were it but to count each crystal drop Which morning's dewy fingers on the blooms Of May distill? Suffice it to have said, By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may obtain a general definition of it, equally applicable to every species. The most important circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referred to; but others more minute we shall subjoin here. Aristotle's account of the matter seems both imperfect and false; ?? ??? ???????, says he, ????? ???????? ?? () ??????, ???????? () ?? ?????????: the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain, and not destructive to its subject. (Poët. c. 5.) For allowing it to be true, as it is not, that the ridiculous is never accompanied with pain, yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous. So that the definition does not distinguish the thing designed. Nay farther; even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject, we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent, and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds. For the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas; but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion. Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous, to which others cannot endure to apply the name; because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling. And this difference, among other causes, has brought a good deal of confusion into this question. That which makes objects ridiculous, is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed; or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful: the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate; belonging always to the same order or class of being; implying sentiment or design; and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart. To prove the several parts of this definition: The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed, is ridiculous: for instance, pompous pretensions of wisdom joined with ignorance or folly in the Socrates of Aristophanes; and the ostentations of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the Thraso of Terence. The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable, is also ridiculous: for instance, the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station. The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves, or in apprehension of the person to whom they relate: in the last-mentioned instance, they both exist in the objects; in the instances from Aristophanes and Terence, one of them is objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character. The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being. A coxcomb in fine cloaths, bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object; because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendour and expence of his dress. A man of sense and merit, in the same circumstances, is not counted ridiculous; because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is, both in fact and in his own apprehension, of a very different species. Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design. A column placed by an architect without a capital or base, is laughed at: the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation. And lastly, the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart, such as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that case, as was observed above, the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous. Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description, and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous, must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances. Where'er the power of ridicule displays Her quaint-ey'd visage, some incongruous form, Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd, Strikes on the quick observer: whether pomp, Or praise, or beauty, mix their partial claim Where sordid fashions, where ignoble deeds, Where foul deformity are wont to dwell; Or whether these with violation loath'd, Invade resplendent pomp's imperious mien, The charms of beauty, or the boast of praise. Ask we for what fair end, the almighty sire Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous, and since so good a reason may be assigned to justify the supreme being for bestowing it; one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction, and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause. Ridicule is not concerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood. It is not in abstract propositions or theorems, but in actions and passions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials for it; and all these terms are relative, implying approbation or blame. To ask them whether ridicule be a test of truth, is, in other words, to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true, can be just and becoming; or whether that which is just and becoming, can be ridiculous. A question that does not deserve a serious answer. For it is most evident, that, as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent, the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition, and finding one idea, which was supposed equal to another, to be in fact unequal, of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood; so, in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause, the faculty of ridicule, finding an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the public, it is our business, if the matter be of importance to society, to drag out those latent circumstances, and, by setting them in full view, to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is: and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry, and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule. But it is said, the practice is dangerous, and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I answer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous; men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us: but the sense of ridicule always judges right. The Socrates of Aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn:—True; but it is not the character of Socrates, the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom. What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character, and thus rendered the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn? No; but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And so has the reasoning of Spinoza made many atheists: he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false; but allow him these, and his conclusions are unavoidably true. And if we must reject the use of ridicule, because, by the imposition of false circumstances, things may be made to seem ridiculous, which are not so in themselves; why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason, because, by proceeding on false principles, conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature, let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine. In mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt, These grateful stings of laughter, from disgust Educing pleasure? Wherefore, but to aid The tardy steps of reason, and at once By this prompt impulse urge us to depress The giddy aims of folly? Though the light Of truth slow-dawning on the inquiring mind, At length unfolds, through many a subtile tie, How these uncouth disorders end at last In public evil! yet benignant heaven, Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears To thousands; conscious what a scanty pause From labours and from care, the wider lot Of humble life affords for studious thought To scan the maze of nature; therefore stamp'd The glaring scenes with characters of scorn, As broad, as obvious, to the passing clown, As to the letter'd sage's curious eye. Such are the various aspects of the mind— Some heavenly genius, whose unclouded thoughts Attain that secret harmony which blends The æthereal spirit with its mold of clay; O! teach me to reveal the grateful charm That searchless nature o'er the sense of man Diffuses, to behold, in lifeless things, The inexpressive semblance of himself, This similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetic diction. Of thought and passion. Mark the sable woods That shade sublime yon mountain's nodding brow; With what religious awe the solemn scene Commands your steps! as if the reverend form Of Minos or of Numa should forsake The Elysian seats, and down the embowering glade Move to your pausing eye! Behold the expanse Of yon gay landscape, where the silver clouds Flit o'er the heavens before the sprightly breeze: Now their grey cincture skirts the doubtful sun; Now streams of splendor, through their opening veil Effulgent, sweep from off the gilded lawn The aërial shadows; on the curling brook, And on the shady margin's quivering leaves With quickest lustre glancing; while you view The prospect, say, within your cheerful breast Plays not the lively sense of winning mirth With clouds and sun-shine chequer'd, while the round Of social converse, to the inspiring tongue Of some gay nymph amid her subject train, Moves all obsequious? Whence is this effect, This kindred power of such discordant things? Or flows their semblance from that mystic tone To which the new-born mind's harmonious powers At first were strung? Or rather from the links Which artful custom twines around her frame? For when the different images of things By chance combin'd, have struck the attentive soul With deeper impulse, or connected long, Have drawn her frequent eye; howe'er distinct The external scenes, yet oft the ideas gain From that conjunction an eternal tie, And sympathy unbroken. Let the mind Recall one partner of the various league, Immediate, lo! the firm confederates rise, And each his former station strait resumes: One movement governs the consenting throng, And all at once with rosy pleasure shine, Or all are sadden'd with the glooms of care. 'Twas thus, if ancient fame the truth unfold, Two faithful needles, from the informing touch See the elegant poem recited by Cardinal Bembo in the character of Lucretius; Strada Prolus. vi. Academ. 2. c. v. Of the same parent-stone, together drew Its mystic virtue, and at first conspir'd With fatal impulse quivering to the pole: Then, though disjoin'd by kingdoms, though the main Rowl'd its broad surge betwixt, and different stars Beheld their wakeful motions, yet preserv'd The former friendship, and remember'd still The alliance of their birth: whate'er the line Which one possess'd, nor pause, nor quiet knew The sure associate, ere with trembling speed He found its path and fix'd unnerring there. Such is the secret union, when we feel A song, a flower, a name, at once restore Those long connected scenes where first they mov'd The attention: backward through her mazy walks Guiding the wanton fancy to her scope, To temples, courts or fields; with all the band Of painted forms, of passions and designs Attendant: whence, if pleasing in itself, The prospect from that sweet accession gains Redoubled influence o'er the listening mind. By these mysterious ties the busy power The act of remembering seems almost wholly to depend on the association of ideas. Of memory her ideal train preserves Intire; or when they would elude her watch, Reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the waste Of dark oblivion; thus collecting all The various forms of being to present, Before the curious aim of mimic art, Their largest choice: like spring's unfolded blooms Exhaling sweetness, that the skillful bee May taste at will, from their selected spoils To work her dulcet food. For not the expanse Of living lakes in summer's noontide calm, Reflects the bordering shade, and sun-bright heavens With fairer semblance; not the sculptur'd gold More faithful keeps the graver's lively trace, Than he whose birth the sister powers of art Propitious view'd, and from his genial star Shed influence to the seeds of fancy kind; Than his attemper'd bosom must preserve The seal of nature. There alone unchang'd, Her form remains. The balmy walks of May There breathe perennial sweets: the trembling chord Resounds for ever in the abstracted car, Melodious: and the virgin's radiant eye, Superior to disease, to grief, and time, Shines with unbating lustre. Thus at length Indow'd with all that nature can bestow, The child of fancy oft in silence bends O'er these mixt treasures of his pregnant breast, With conscious pride. From them he oft resolves To frame he knows not what excelling things; And win he knows not what sublime reward Of praise and wonder. By degrees, the mind Feels her young nerves dilate: the plastic powers Labour for action: blind emotions heave His bosom; and with loveliest frenzy caught, From earth to heaven he rowls his daring eye, From heaven to earth. Anon ten thousand shapes, Like spectres trooping to the wisard's call, Flit swift before him. From the womb of earth, From ocean's bed they come: the eternal heavens Disclose their splendors, and the dark abyss Pours out her births unknown: With fixed gaze He marks the rising phantoms. Now compares Their different forms; now blends them, now divides, Inlarges and extenuates by turns; Opposes, ranges in fantastic bands, And infinitely varies. Hither now, Now thither fluctuates his inconstant aim, With endless choice perplex'd. At length his plan Begins to open. Lucid order dawns; And as from Chaos old the jarring seeds Of nature at the voice divine repair'd Each to its place, till rosy earth unveil'd Her fragrant bosom, and the joyful sun Sprung up the blue serene; by swift degrees Thus disentangled, his entire design Emerges. Colours mingle, features join, And lines converge: the fainter parts retire; The fairer eminent in light advance; And every image on its neighbour smiles. A while he stands, and with a father's joy Contemplates. Then with Promethéan art, Into its proper vehicle he breathes This relates to the different sorts of corporeal mediums, by which the ideas of the artists are rendered palpable to the senses; as by sounds, in music; by lines and shadows, in painting; by diction, in poetry, &amp;c. The fair conception; which, imbodied thus, And permanent, becomes to eyes or ears An object ascertain'd: while thus inform'd, The various organs of his mimic skill, The consonance of sounds, the featur'd rock, The shadowy picture and impassion'd verse, Beyond their proper powers attract the soul By that expressive semblance, while in sight Of nature's great original we scan The lively child of art; while line by line, And feature after feature we refer To that sublime exemplar whence it stole Those animating charms. Thus beauty's palm Betwixt them wavering hangs: applauding love Doubts where to chuse; and mortal man aspires To tempt creative praise. As when a cloud Of gathering hail with limpid crusts of ice Inclos'd and obvious to the beaming sun, Collects his large effulgence; strait the heavens With equal flames present on either hand The radiant visage: Persia stands at gaze, Appall'd; and on the brink of Ganges doubts The snowy-vested seer, in Mithra's name, To which the fragrance of the south shall burn, To which his warbled orisons ascend. Such various bliss the well-tun'd heart enjoys, Favour'd of heaven! while plung'd in sordid cares, The unfeeling vulgar mocks the boon divine: And harsh austerity, from whose rebuke Young love and smiling wonder shrink away Abash'd and chill of heart, with sager frowns Condemns the fair inchantment. On my strain, Perhaps even now, some cold, fastidious judge Casts a disdainful eye; and calls my toil, And calls the love and beauty which i sing, The dream of folly. Thou, grave censor! say, Is beauty then a dream, because the glooms Of dulness hang too heavy on thy sense, To let her shine upon thee? So the man Whose eye ne'er open'd on the light of heaven, Might smile with scorn while raptur'd vision tells Of the gay-colour'd radiance flushing bright O'er all creation. From the wise be far Such gross unhallow'd pride; nor needs my song Descend so low; but rather now unfold, If human thought could reach, or words unfold, By what mysterious fabric of the mind, The deep-felt joys and harmony of sound Result from airy motion; and from shape The lovely phantoms of sublime and fair. By what fine ties hath God connected things When present in the mind, which in themselves Have no connection? Sure the rising sun O'er the cærulean convex of the sea, With equal brightness and with equal warmth Might rowl his fiery orb; nor yet the soul Thus feel her frame expanded, and her powers Exulting in the splendor she beholds; Like a young conqueror moving through the pomp Of some triumphal day. When join'd at eve, Soft-murmuring streams and gales of gentlest breath Melodious Philomela's wakeful strain Attemper, could not man's discerning ear Through all its tones the sympathy pursue; Nor yet this breath divine of nameless joy Steal through his veins and fan the awaken'd heart, Mild as the breeze, yet rapturous as the song. But were not nature still endow'd at large With all which life requires, though unadorn'd With such inchantment? Wherefore then her form So exquisitely fair? her breath perfum'd With such æthereal sweetness? whence her voice Inform'd at will to raise or to depress The impassion'd soul? and whence the robes of light Which thus invest her with more lovely pomp Than fancy can describe? Whence but from thee, O source divine of ever-flowing love, And thy unmeasur'd goodness? Not content With every food of life to nourish man, By kind illusions of the wondering sense Thou mak'st all nature beauty to his eye, Or music to his ear: well-pleas'd he scans The goodly prospect; and with inward smiles Treads the gay verdure of the painted plain; Beholds the azure canopy of heaven, And living lamps that over-arch his head With more than regal splendor; bends his ears To the full choir of water, air, and earth; Nor heeds the pleasing error of his thought, Nor doubts the painted green or azure arch, Nor questions more the music's mingling sounds Than space, or motion, or eternal time; So sweet he feels their influence to attract The fixed soul; to brighten the dull glooms Of care, and make the destin'd road of life Delightful to his feet. So fables tell, The adventurous heroe, bound on hard exploits, Beholds with glad surprise, by secret spells Of some kind sage, the patron of his toils, A visionary paradise disclos'd Amid the dubious wild: with streams, and shades, And airy songs, the enchanted landscape smiles, Cheers his long labours and renews his frame. What then is taste, but these internal powers Active, and strong, and feelingly alive To each fine impulse? a discerning sense Of decent and sublime, with quick disgust From things deform'd, or disarrang'd, or gross In species? This, nor gems, nor stores of gold, Nor purple state, nor culture can bestow; But God alone, when first his active hand Imprints the secret byass of the soul. He, mighty parent! wise and just in all, Free as the vital breeze or light of heaven, Reveals the charms of nature. Ask the swain Who journeys homeward from a summer day's Long labour, why, forgetful of his toils And due repose, he loiters to behold The sunshine gleaming as through amber clouds, O'er all the western sky; full soon, I ween, His rude expression and untutor'd airs, Beyond the power of language, will unfold The form of beauty smiling at his heart, How lovely! how commanding! But though heaven In every breast hath sown these early seeds Of love and admiration, yet in vain, Without fair culture's kind parental aid, Without inlivening suns, and genial showers, And shelter from the blast, in vain we hope The tender plant should rear its blooming head, Or yield the harvest promis'd in its spring. Nor yet will every soil with equal stores Repay the tiller's labour; or attend His will, obsequious, whether to produce The olive or the laurel. Different minds Incline to different objects: one pursues See the note to ver. 18. of this book. The vast alone, the wonderful, the wild; Another sighs for harmony, and grace, And gentlest beauty. Hence when lightening fires The arch of heaven, and thunders rock the ground, When furious whirlwinds rend the howling air, And ocean, groaning from his lowest bed, Heaves his tempestuous billows to the sky; Amid the mighty uproar, while below The nations tremble, Shakespeare looks abroad From some high cliff, superior, and enjoys The elemental war. But Waller longs, O! how I long my careless limbs to lay Under the plantane shade; and all the day With amorous airs my fancy entertain, &amp;c. Waller, Battle of the Summer-Islands, Canto I.

Such and so various are the tastes of men. Oh! blest of heaven, whom not the languid songs Of luxury, the Siren! not the bribes Of sordid wealth, nor all the gaudy spoils Of pageant honour can seduce to leave Those ever blooming sweets, which from the store Of nature fair imagination culls To charm the inliven'd soul! What though not all Of mortal offspring can attain the heights Of envied life; though only few possess Patrician treasures or imperial state; Yet nature's care, to all her children just, With richer treasures and an ampler state, Indows at large whatever happy man Will deign to use them.

For him, the spring Distills her dews, and from the silken gem Its lucid leaves unfolds: for him, the hand Of autumn tinges every fertile branch With blooming gold and blushes like the morn. Each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings; And still new beauties meet his lonely walk, And loves unfelt attract him. Not a breeze That this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy, it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest, wisest, and best of men on this head; one so little to be suspected of partiality in the case, that he reckons it among those favours for which he was especially thankful to the gods, that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry, lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station. Speaking of the beauty of universal nature, he observes, that there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive, when once we consider its connection with that general order. He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities; and then adds, that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal order—will discern many amiable things, not credible to every mind, but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with nature and her works.

Flies o'er the meadow, not a cloud imbibes The setting sun's effulgence, not a strain From all the tenants of the warbling shade Ascends, but whence his bosom can partake Fresh pleasure, unreprov'd. Nor thence partakes Fresh pleasure only: for the attentive mind, By this harmonious action on her powers Becomes herself harmonious: wont so oft In outward things to meditate the charm Of sacred order, soon she seeks at home To find a kindred order, to exert Within herself this elegance of love, This fair-inspir'd delight: her temper'd powers Refine at length, and every passion wears A chaster, milder, more attractive mien. But if to ampler prospects, if to gaze On nature's form, where, negligent of all These lesser graces, she assumes the port Of that eternal majesty that weigh'd The world's foundations, if to these the mind Exalts her daring eye; then mightier far Will be the change, and nobler. Would the forms Of servile custom cramp her generous powers? Would sordid policies, the barbarous growth Of ignorance and rapine, bow her down To tame pursuits, to indolence and fear? Lo! she appeals to nature, to the winds And rowling waves, the sun's unwearied course, The elements and seasons: all declare For what the eternal maker has ordain'd The powers of man: we feel within ourselves His energy divine: he tells the heart, He meant, he made us to behold and love What he beholds and loves, the general orb Of life and being; to be great like him, Beneficent and active. Thus the men Whom nature's works can charm, with God himself Hold converse; grow familiar, day by day, With his conceptions, act upon his plan; And form to his, the relish of their souls. END OF BOOK III. THE PLEASURES OF THE IMAGINATION: A POEM. THE GENERAL ARGUMENT. The pleasures of the imagination proceed either from natural objects, as from a flourishing grove, a clear and murmuring fountain, a calm sea by moon-light; or from works of art, such as a noble edifice, a musical tune, a statue, a picture, a poem. In treating of these pleasures, we must begin with the former class; they being original to the other; and nothing more being necessary, in order to explain them, than a view of our natural inclination toward greatness and beauty, and of those appearances, in the world around us, to which that inclination is adapted. This is the subject of the first book of the following poem. But the pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts, from music, sculpture, painting, and poetry, are much more various and complicated. In them (besides greatness and beauty, or forms proper to the imagination) we find interwoven frequent representations of truth, of virtue and vice, of circumstances proper to move us with laughter, or to excite in us pity, fear, and the other passions. These moral and intellectual objects are described in the second book; to which the third properly belongs as an episode, though too large to have been included in it. With the above-mentioned causes of pleasure, which are universal in the course of human life and appertain to our higher faculties, many others do generally concur, more limited in their operation, or of an inferior origin: such are the novelty of objects, the association of ideas, affections of the bodily senses, influences of education, national habits, and the like. To illustrate these, and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect taste, is the argument of the fourth book. Hitherto the pleasures of the imagination belong to the human species in general. But there are certain particular men whose imagination is indowed with powers, and susceptible of pleasures, which the generality of mankind never participate. these are the men of genius, destined by nature to excell in one or other of the arts already mentioned. It is proposed therefore, in the last place, to delineate that genius which in some degree appears common to them all; yet with a more peculiar consideration of poetry: inasmuch as poetry is the most extensive of those arts, the most philosophical, and the most useful.

With what inchantment nature's goodly scene Attracts the sense of mortals; how the mind For its own eye doth objects nobler still Prepare; how men by various lessons learn To judge of beauty's praise; what raptures fill The breast with fancy's native arts indow'd And what true culture guides it to renown; My verse unfolds. Ye gods, or godlike powers, Ye guardians of the sacred task, attend Propitious. Hand in hand around your bard Move in majestic measures, leading on His doubtful step through many a solemn path Conscious of secrets which to human sight Ye only can reveal. Be great in him: And let your favor make him wise to speak Of all your wonderous empire; with a voice So temper'd to his theme, that those, who hear, May yield perpetual homage to yourselves. Thou chief, o daughter of eternal Love, Whate'er thy name; or Muse, or Grace, ador'd By Grecian prophets; to the sons of heaven Known, while with deep amazement thou dost there The perfect counsels read, the ideas old, Of thine omniscient father; known on earth By the still horror and the blissful tear With which thou seizest on the soul of man; Thou chief, Poetic Spirit, from the banks Of Avon, whence thy holy fingers cull Fresh flowers and dews to sprinkle on the turf Where Shakespear lies, be present, and with thee Let Fiction come; on her aërial wings Wafting ten thousand colors; which in sport, By the light glances of her magic eye, She blends and shifts at will through countless forms, Her wild creation. Goddess of the lyre Whose awful tones controul the moving sphere, Wilt thou, eternal Harmony, descend, And join this happy train? for with thee comes The guide, the guardian of their mystic rites, Wise Order: and, where Order deigns to come, Her sister, Liberty, will not be far. Be present all ye Genii, who conduct Of youthful bards the lonely-wandering step New to your springs and shades; who touch their ear With finer sounds, and heighten to their eye The pomp of nature, and before them place The fairest, loftiest countenance of things. Nor thou, my Dyson, to the lay refuse Thy wonted partial audience. What, though first In years unseason'd, haply ere the sports Of childhood yet were o'er, the adventurous lay With many splendid prospects, many charms, Allur'd my heart, nor conscious whence they sprung, Nor heedful of their end? yet serious truth Her empire o'er the calm, sequester'd theme Asserted soon; while falsehood's evil brood, Vice and deceitful pleasure, she at once Excluded, and my fancy's careless toil Drew to the better cause. Maturer aid Thy friendship added, in the paths of life, The busy paths, my unaccustom'd feet Preserving: nor to truth's recess divine, Through this wide argument's unbeaten space, Witholding surer guidance; while by turns We trac'd the sages old, or while the queen Of sciences (whom manners and the mind Acknowledge) to my true companion's voice Not unattentive, o'er the wintry lamp Inclin'd her scepter, favoring. Now the fates Have other tasks impos'd. to thee, my friend, The ministry of freedom and the faith Of popular decrees, in early youth, Not vainly they committed. me they sent To wait on pain; and silent arts to urge, Inglorious: not ignoble; if my cares, To such as languish on a grievous bed, Ease and the sweet forgetfulness of ill Conciliate: nor delightless; if the Muse, Her shades to visit and to taste her springs, If some distinguish'd hours the bounteous Muse Impart, and grant (what she and she alone Can grant to mortals) that my hand those wreaths Of fame and honest favor, which the bless'd Wear in Elysium, and which never felt The breath of envy or malignant tongues, That these my hand for thee and for myself May gather. Meanwhile, o my faithful friend, O early chosen, ever found the same, And trusted and belov'd; once more the verse Long destin'd, always obvious to thine ear, Attend, indulgent. so in latest years, When time thy head with honors shall have cloth'd Sacred to even virtue, may thy mind, Amid the calm review of seasons past, Fair offices of friendship or kind peace Or public zeal, may then thy mind well-pleas'd Recall these happy studies of our prime. From heaven my strains begin. from heaven descends The flame of genius to the chosen breast, And beauty with poetic wonder join'd, And inspiration. Ere the rising sun Shone o'er the deep, or 'mid the vault of night The moon her silver lamp suspended: ere The vales with springs were water'd, or with groves Of oak or pine the ancient hills were crown'd; Then the great spirit, whom his works adore, Within his own deep essence view'd the forms, The forms eternal of created things: The radiant sun; the moon's nocturnal lamp; The mountains and the streams; the ample stores Of earth, of heaven, of nature. From the first, On that full scene his love divine he fix'd, His admiration. till, in time compleat, What he admir'd and lov'd his vital power Unfolded into being. Hence the breath Of life informing each organic frame: Hence the green earth, and wild-resounding waves: Hence light and shade, alternate; warmth and cold; And bright autumnal skies, and vernal showers, And all the fair variety of things. But not alike to every mortal eye Is this great scene unveil'd. For while the claims Of social life to different labours urge The active powers of man, with wisest care Hath nature on the multitude of minds Impress'd a various bias; and to each Decreed its province in the common toil. To some she taught the fabric of the sphere, The changeful moon, the circuit of the stars, The golden zones of heaven. to some she gave To search the story of eternal thought; Of space, and time; of fate's unbroken chain, And will's quick movement. others by the hand She led o'er vales and mountains, to explore What healing virtue dwells in every vein Of herbs or trees. But some to nobler hopes Were destin'd: some within a finer mould She wrought, and temper'd with a purer flame. To these the sire omnipotent unfolds, In fuller aspects and with fairer lights, This picture of the world. Through every part They trace the lofty sketches of his hand: In earth, or air, the meadow's flowery store, The moon's mild radiance, or the virgin's mien Dress'd in attractive smiles, they see portray'd. (As far as mortal eyes the portrait scan) Those lineaments of beauty which delight The mind supreme. They also feel their force, Inamor'd: they partake the eternal joy. For as old Memnon's image long renown'd Through fabling Egypt, at the genial touch Of morning, from its inmost frame sent forth Spontaneous music; so doth nature's hand, To certain attributes which matter claims, Adapt the finer organs of the mind: So the glad impulse of those kindred powers (Of form, of colour's cheerful pomp, of sound: Melodious, or of motion aptly sped) Detains the inliven'd sense; till soon the soul Feels the deep concord and assents through all Her functions. Then the charm by fate prepar'd Diffuseth its inchantment. fancy dreams, Rapt into high discourse with prophets old, And wandering through Elysium, fancy dreams Of sacred fountains, of o'ershadowing groves, Whose walks with godlike harmony resound: Fountains, which Homer visits; happy groves, Where Milton dwells. the intellectual power, On the mind's throne, suspends his graver cares, And smiles. the passions, to divine repose, Persuaded yield: and love and joy alone Are waking: love and joy, such as await An angel's meditation. O! attend, Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch; Whom nature's aspect, nature's simple garb Can thus command; o! listen to my song; And i will guide thee to her blissful walks, And teach thy solitude her voice to hear, And point her gracious features to thy view. Know then, whate'er of the world's ancient store, Whate'er of mimic art's reflected scenes, With love and admiration thus inspire Attentive fancy, her delighted sons In two illustrious orders comprehend, Self-taught. from him whose rustic toil the lark Cheers warbling, to the bard whose daring thoughts Range the full orb of being, still the form, Which fancy worships, or sublime or fair Her votaries proclaim. I see them dawn: I see the radiant visions where they rise, More lovely than when Lucifer displays His glittering forehead through the gates of morn, To lead the train of Phœbus and the spring. Say, why was man so eminently rais'd Amid the vast creation; why impower'd Through life and death to dart his watchful eye, With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame; But that the omnipotent might send him forth, In sight of angels and immortal minds, As on an ample theatre to join In contest with his equals, who shall best The task atchieve, the course of noble toils, By wisdom and by mercy preordain'd? Might send him forth the sovran good to learn; To chace each meaner purpose from his breast; And through the mists of passion and of sense, And through the pelting storms of chance and pain, To hold strait on with constant heart and eye Still fix'd upon his everlasting palm, The approving smile of heaven? Else wherefore burns In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope, That seeks from day to day sublimer ends; Happy, though restless? Why departs the soul Wide from the track and journey of her times, To grasp the good she knows not? in the field Of things which may be, in the spacious field Of science, potent arts, or dreadful arms, To raise up scenes in which her own desires Contented may repose; when things, which are, Pall on her temper, like a twice-told tale: Her temper, still demanding to be free; Spurning the rude controul of willful might; Proud of her dangers brav'd, her griefs indur'd Her strength severely prov'd? To these high aims, Which reason and affection prompt in man, Not adverse nor unapt hath nature fram'd His bold imagination. For, amid The various forms which this full world presents Like rivals to his choice, what human breast E'er doubts, before the transient and minute, To prize the vast, the stable, the sublime? Who, that from heights aërial sends his eye Around a wild horizon, and surveys Indus or Ganges rolling his broad wave Through mountains, plains, through spacious cities old, And regions dark with woods; will turn away To mark the path of some penurious rill Which murmureth at his feet? Where does the soul Consent her soaring fancy to restrain, Which bears her up, as on an eagle's wings, Destin'd for highest heaven; or which of fate's Tremendous barriers shall confine her flight To any humbler quarry? The rich earth Cannot detain her; nor the ambient air With all its changes. For a while with joy She hovers o'er the sun, and views the small Attendant orbs, beneath his sacred beam, Emerging from the deep, like cluster'd isles Whose rocky shores to the glad sailor's eye Reflect the gleams of morning: for a while With pride she sees his firm, paternal sway Bend the reluctant planets to move each Round its perpetual year. But soon she quits That prospect: meditating loftier views, She darts adventurous up the long career Of comets; through the constellations holds Her course, and now looks back on all the stars Whose blended flames as with a milky stream Part the blue region. Empyréan tracts, Where happy souls beyond this concave heaven Abide, she then explores, whence purer light For countless ages travels through the abyss Nor hath in sight of mortals yet arriv'd. Upon the wide creation's utmost shore At length she stands, and the dread space beyond Contemplates, half-recoiling: nathless down The gloomy void, astonish'd, yet unquell'd, She plungeth; down the unfathomable gulph Where God alone hath being. There her hopes Rest at the fated goal. For, from the birth Of human kind, the sovran maker said That not in humble, nor in brief delight, Not in the fleeting echos of renown, Power's purple robes, nor pleasure's flowery lap, The soul should find contentment; but, from these Turning disdainful to an equal good, Through nature's opening walks inlarge her aim, Till every bound at length should disappear, And infinite perfection fill the scene. But lo, where beauty, dress'd in gentler pomp, With comely steps advancing, claims the verse Her charms inspire. O beauty, source of praise, Of honour, even to mute and lifeless things; O thou that kindlest in each human heart Love, and the wish of poets, when their tongue Would teach to other bosoms what so charms Their own; o child of nature and the soul, In happiest hour brought forth; the doubtful garb Of words, of earthly language, all too mean, Too lowly i account, in which to clothe Thy form divine. for thee the mind alone Beholds; nor half thy brightness can reveal Through those dim organs, whose corporeal touch O'ershadoweth thy pure essence. Yet, my Muse, If fortune call thee to the task, wait thou Thy favorable seasons: then, while fear And doubt are absent, through wide nature's bounds Expatiate with glad step, and choose at will Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains, Whate'er the waters, or the liquid air, To manifest unblemish'd beauty's praise, And o'er the breasts of mortals to extend Her gracious empire. Wilt thou to the isles Atlantic, to the rich Hesperian clime, Fly in the train of Autumn; and look on, And learn from him; while, as he roves around, Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove, The branches bloom with gold; where'er his foot Imprints the soil, the ripening clusters swell, Turning aside their foliage, and come forth In purple lights, till every hilloc glows As with the blushes of an evening sky? Or wilt thou that Thessalian landscape trace, Where slow Penéus his clear glassy tide Draws smooth along, between the winding cliffs Of Ossa and the pathless woods unshorn That wave o'er huge Olympus? Down the stream, Look how the mountains with their double range Imbrace the vale of Tempe; from each side Ascending steep to heaven, a rocky mound Cover'd with ivy and the laurel boughs That crown'd young Phœbus for the Python slain. Fair Tempe! on whose primrose banks the morn Awoke most fragrant, and the noon repos'd In pomp of lights and shadows most sublime: Whose lawns, whose glades, ere human footsteps yet Had trac'd an entrance, were the hallow'd haunt Of sylvan powers immortal: where they sate Oft in the golden age, the Nymphs and Fauns, Beneath some arbor branching o'er the flood, And leaning round hung on the instructive lips Of hoary Pan, or o'er some open dale Danc'd in light measures to his sevenfold pipe, While Zephyr's wanton hand along their path Flung showers of painted blossoms, fertile dews, And one perpetual spring. But if our task More lofty rites demand, with all good vows Then let us hasten to the rural haunt Where young Melissa dwells. Nor thou refuse The voice which calls thee from thy lov'd retreat, But hither, gentle maid, thy footsteps turn: Here, to thy own unquestionable theme, O fair, o graceful, bend thy polish'd brow, Assenting; and the gladness of thy eyes Impart to me, like morning's wished light Seen through the vernal air. By yonder stream, Where beech and elm along the bordering mead Send forth wild melody from every bough, Together let us wander; where the hills Cover'd with fleeces to the lowing vale Reply; where tidings of content and peace Each echo brings. Lo, how the western sun O'er fields and floods, o'er every living soul, Diffuseth glad repose! There while i speak Of beauty's honors, thou, Melissa, thou Shalt hearken, not unconscious. while i tell How first from heaven she came: how after all; The works of life, the elemental scenes, The hours, the seasons, she had oft explor'd, At length her favorite mansion and her throne She fix'd in woman's form: what pleasing ties To virtue bind her; what effectual aid They lend each other's power; and how divine Their union, should some unambitious maid, To all the inchantment of the Idalian queen, Add sanctity and wisdom: while my tongue Prolongs the tale, Melissa, thou may'st feign To wonder whence my rapture is inspir'd; But soon the smile which dawns upon thy lip Shall tell it, and the tenderer bloom o'er all That soft cheek springing to the marble neck, Which bends aside in vain, revealing more What it would thus keep silent, and in vain The sense of praise dissembling. Then my song Great nature's winning arts, which thus inform With joy and love the rugged breast of man, Should sound in numbers worthy of such a theme: While all whose souls have ever felt the force Of those inchanting passions, to my lyre Should throng attentive, and receive once more Their influence, unobscur'd by any cloud Of vulgar care, and purer than the hand Of fortune can bestow: nor, to confirm Their sway, should awful contemplation scorn To join his dictates to the genuine strain Of pleasure's tongue; nor yet should pleasure's ear Be much averse. Ye chiefly, gentle band Of youths and virgins, who through many a wish And many a fond pursuit, as in some scene Of magic bright and fleeting, are allur'd By various beauty; if the pleasing toil Can yield a moment's respite, hither turn Your favorable ear, and trust my words. I do not mean, on bless'd religion's seat Presenting superstition's gloomy form, To dash your soothing hopes: i do not mean To bid the jealous thunderer fire the heavens, Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth, And scare you from your joys. my cheerful song With happier omens calls you to the field, Pleas'd with your generous ardor in the chace, And warm like you. Then tell me (for ye know) Doth beauty ever deign to dwell where use And aptitude are strangers? is her praise Confess'd in aught whose most peculiar ends Are lame and fruitless? or did nature mean This pleasing call the herald of a lye, To hide the shame of discord and disease, And win each fond admirer into snares, Foil'd, baffled? No. with better providence The general mother, conscious how infirm Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill, Thus, to the choice of credulous desire, Doth objects the completest of their tribe Distinguish and commend. Yon flowery bank Cloth'd in the soft magnificence of spring, Will not the flocks approve it? will they ask The reedy fen for pasture? That clear rill Which trickleth murmuring from the mossy rock, Yields it less wholesome beverage to the worn And thirsty traveler, than the standing pool With muddy weeds o'ergrown? Yon ragged vine Whose lean and sullen clusters mourn the rage Of Eurus, will the wine-press or the bowl Report of her, as of the swelling grape Which glitters through the tendrils, like a gem When first it meets the sun? Or what are all The various charms to life and sense adjoin'd? Are they not pledges of a state intire, Where native order reigns, with every part In health, and every function well perform'd? Thus then at first was beauty sent from heaven, The lovely ministress of truth and good In this dark world. for truth and good are one; And beauty dwells in them, and they in her, With like participation. Wherefore then, O sons of earth, would ye dissolve the tie? O! wherefore with a rash and greedy aim Seek ye to rove through every flattering scene Which beauty seems to deck, nor once inquire Where is the suffrage of eternal truth, Or where the seal of undeceitful good, To save your search from folly? Wanting these, Lo, beauty withers in your void embrace; And with the glittering of an idiot's toy Did fancy mock your vows. Nor yet let hope, That kindliest inmate of the youthful breast, Be hence appall'd; be turn'd to coward sloth Sitting in silence, with dejected eyes Incurious and with folded hands. far less Let scorn of wild fantastic folly's dreams Or hatred of the bigot's savage pride Persuade you e'er that beauty, or the love Which waits on beauty, may not brook to hear The sacred lore of undeceitful good And truth eternal. From the vulgar croud Though superstition, tyranness abhorr'd, The reverence due to this majestic pair With threats and execration still demands; Though the tame wretch, who asks of her the way To their celestial dwelling, she constrains To quench or set at nought the lamp of God Within his frame; through many a cheerless wild Though forth she leads him credulous and dark And aw'd with dubious notion; though at length Haply she plunge him into cloister'd cells And mansions unrelenting as the grave, But void of quiet, there to watch the hours Of midnight; there, amid the screaming owl's Dire song, with spectres or with guilty shades To talk of pangs and everlasting woe; Yet be not ye dismay'd. a gentler star Presides o'er your adventure. From the bower Where wisdom sate with her Athenian sons, Could but my happy hand intwine a wreath Of Plato's olive with the Mantuan bay, Then (for what need of cruel fear to you, To you whom godlike love can well command?) Then should my powerful voice at once dispell Those monkish horrors; should in words divine Relate how favor'd minds like you inspir'd, And taught their inspiration to conduct By ruling heaven's decree, through various walks And prospects various, but delightful all, Move onward; while now myrtle groves appear, Now arms and radiant trophies, now the rods Of empire with the curule throne, or now The domes of contemplation and the Muse. Led by that hope sublime, whose cloudless eye Through the fair toils and ornaments of earth Discerns the nobler life reserv'd for heaven, Favor'd alike they worship round the shrine Where truth conspicuous with her sister-twins, The undivided partners of her sway, With good and beauty reigns. O! let not us By pleasure's lying blandishments detain'd, Or crouching to the frowns of bigot rage, O! let not us one moment pause to join That chosen band. And if the gracious power, Who first awaken'd my untutor'd song, Will to my invocation grant anew The tuneful spirit, then through all our paths Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyre Be wanting; whether on the rosy mead When summer smiles, to warn the melting heart Of luxury's allurement; whether firm Against the torrent and the stubborn hill To urge free virtue's steps, and to her side Summon that strong divinity of soul Which conquers chance and fate; or on the height, The goal assign'd her, haply to proclaim Her triumph; on her brow to place the crown Of uncorrupted praise; through future worlds To follow her interminated way, And bless heaven's image in the heart of man. Such is the worth of beauty: such her power, So blameless, so rever'd. It now remains, In just gradation through the various ranks Of being, to contemplate how her gifts Rise in due measure, watchful to attend The steps of rising nature. Last and least, In colors mingling with a random blaze, Doth beauty dwell. Then higher in the forms Of simplest, easiest measure; in the bounds Of circle, cube, or sphere. The third ascent To symmetry adds color: thus the pearl Shines in the concave of its purple bed, And painted shells along some winding shore Catch with indented folds the glancing sun. Next, as we rise, appear the blooming tribes Which clothe the fragrant earth; which draw from her Their own nutrition; which are born and die; Yet, in their seed, immortal: such the flowers With which young Maia pays the village-maids That hail her natal morn; and such the groves Which blithe Pomona rears on Vaga's bank, To feed the bowl of Ariconian swains Who quaff beneath her branches. Nobler still Is beauty's name where, to the full consent Of members and of features, to the pride Of color, and the vital change of growth, Life's holy flame with piercing sense is given, While active motion speaks the temper'd soul: So moves the bird of Juno: so the steed With rival swiftness beats the dusty plain, And faithful dogs with eager airs of joy Salute their fellows. What sublimer pomp Adorns the seat where virtue dwells on earth, And truth's eternal day-light shines around; What palm belongs to man's imperial front, And woman powerful with becoming smiles, Chief of terrestrial natures; need we now Strive to inculcate? Thus hath beauty there Her most conspicuous praise to matter lent, Where most conspicuous through that shadowy veil Breaks forth the bright expression of a mind: By steps directing our inraptur'd search. To him, the first of minds; the chief; the sole; From whom, through this wide, complicated world, Did all her various lineaments begin; To whom alone, consenting and intire, At once their mutual influence all display. He, God most high (bear witness, earth and heaven) The living fountains in himself contains Of beauteous and sublime. with him inthron'd Ere days or years trod their ethereal way, In his supreme intelligence inthron'd, The queen of love holds her unclouded state, Urania. Thee, o father, this extent Of matter; thee the sluggish earth and tract Of seas, the heavens and heavenly splendors feel Pervading, quickening, moving. From the depth Of thy great essence, forth did'st thou conduct Eternal Form; and there, where Chaos reign'd, Gav'st her dominion to erect her seat, And sanctify the mansion. All her works Well-pleas'd thou did'st behold. the gloomy fires Of storm or earthquake, and the purest light Of summer; soft Campania's new-born rose And the slow weed, which pines on Russian hills, Comely alike to thy full vision stand: To thy surrounding vision, which unites All essences and powers of the great world In one sole order, fair alike they stand, As features well consenting, and alike Requir'd by nature ere she could attain Her just resemblance to the perfect shape Of universal beauty, which with thee Dwelt from the first. Thou also, ancient mind, Whom love and free beneficence await In all thy doings; to inferior minds, Thy offspring, and to man, thy youngest son, Refusing no convenient gift nor good; Their eyes did'st open, in this earth, yon heaven, Those starry worlds, the countenance divine Of beauty to behold. But not to them Didst thou her awful magnitude reveal Such as before thine own unbounded sight She stands, (for never shall created soul Conceive that object) nor, to all their kinds, The same in shape or features didst thou frame Her image. Measuring well their different spheres Of sense and action, thy paternal hand Hath for each race prepar'd a different test Of beauty, own'd and reverenc'd as their guide Most apt, most faithful. Thence inform'd, they scan The objects that surround them; and select, Since the great whole disclaims their scanty view, Each for himself selects peculiar parts Of nature; what the standard fix'd by heaven Within his breast approves: acquiring thus A partial beauty, which becomes his lot; A beauty which his eye may comprehend, His hand may copy: leaving, o supreme, O thou whom none hath utter'd, leaving all To thee that infinite, consummate form, Which the great powers, the gods around thy throne And nearest to thy counsels, know with thee For ever to have been; but who she is, Or what her likeness, know not. Man surveys A narrower scene, where, by the mix'd effect Of things corporeal on his passive mind, He judgeth what is fair. Corporeal things The mind of man impell with various powers, And various features to his eye disclose. The powers which move his sense with instant joy, The features which attract his heart to love, He marks, combines, reposits. other powers And features of the self-same thing (unless The beauteous form, the creature of his mind, Request their close alliance) he o'erlooks Forgotten; or with self-beguiling zeal, Whene'er his passions mingle in the work, Half alters, half disowns. The tribes of men Thus from their different functions and the shapes Familiar to their eye, with art obtain, Unconscious of their purpose, yet with art Obtain the beauty fitting man to love: Whose proud desires from nature's homely toil Oft turn away, fastidious: asking still His mind's high aid, to purify the form From matter's gross communion; to secure For ever, from the meddling hand of change Or rude decay, her features; and to add Whatever ornaments may suit her mien, Where'er he finds them scatter'd through the paths Of nature or of fortune. Then he seats The accomplish'd image deep within his breast, Reviews it, and accounts it good and fair. Thus the one beauty of the world intire, The universal Venus, far beyond The keenest effort of created eyes, And their most wide horizon, dwells inthron'd In ancient silence. At her footstool stands An altar burning with eternal fire Unsullied, unconsum'd. Here every hour, Here every moment, in their turns arrive Her offspring; an innumerable band Of sisters, comely all; but differing far In age, in stature, and expressive mien, More than bright Helen from her new-born babe. To this maternal shrine in turns they come, Each with her sacred lamp; that from the source Of living flame, which here immortal flows, Their portions of its lustre they may draw For days, or months, or years; for ages, some; As their great parent's discipline requires. Then to their several mansions they depart, In stars, in planets, through the unknown shores Of yon ethereal ocean. Who can tell, Even on the surface of this rowling earth, How many make abode? The fields, the groves, The winding rivers and the azure main, Are render'd solemn by their frequent feet, Their rites sublime. There each her destin'd home Informs with that pure radiance from the skies Brought down, and shines throughout her little sphere, Exulting. Strait, as travellers by night Turn toward a distant flame, so some sit eye, Among the various tenants of the scene, Discerns the heaven-born phantom seated there, And owns her charms. Hence the wide universe, Through all the seasons of revolving worlds, Bears witness with its people, gods and men, To beauty's blissful power, and with the voice Of grateful admiration still resounds: That voice, to which is beauty's frame divine As is the cunning of the master's hand To the sweet accent of the well-tun'd lyre. Genius of ancient Greece, whose faithful steps Have led us to these awful solitudes Of nature and of science; nurse rever'd Of generous counsels and heroic deeds; O! let some portion of thy matchless praise Dwell in my breast, and teach me to adorn This unattempted theme. Nor be my thoughts Presumptuous counted, if amid the calm Which Hesper sheds along the vernal heaven, If i, from vulgar superstition's walk, Impatient steal, and from the unseemly rites Of splendid adulation, to attend With hymns thy presence in the sylvan shade, By their malignant footsteps unprofan'd. Come, o renowned power; thy glowing mien Such, and so elevated all thy form, As when the great barbaric lord, again And yet again diminish'd, hid his face Among the herd of satraps and of kings; And, at the lightning of thy lifted spear, Crouch'd like a slave. Bring all thy martial spoils, Thy palms, thy laurels, thy triumphal songs, Thy smiling band of arts, thy godlike sires Of civil wisdom, thy unconquer'd youth After some glorious day rejoicing round Their new-erected trophy. Guide my feet Through fair Lycéum's walk, the olive shades Of Academus, and the sacred vale Haunted by steps divine, where once beneath That ever-living platane's ample boughs Ilissus, by Socratic sounds detain'd, On his neglected urn attentive lay; While Boreas, lingering on the neighboring steep With beauteous Orithyía, his love-tale In silent awe suspended. There let me With blameless hand, from thy unenvious fields, Transplant some living blossoms, to adorn My native clime: while, far beyond the meed Of fancy's toil aspiring, i unlock The springs of antient wisdom: while i add (What cannot be disjoin'd from beauty's praise) Thy name and native dress, thy works belov'd And honor'd: while to my compatriot youth I point the great example of thy sons, And tune to Attic themes the British lyre. THE END OF BOOK THE FIRST. BOOK THE SECOND. THE ARGUMENT. Introduction to this more difficult part of the subject. Of truth and its three classes, matter of fact, experimental or scientifical truth, (contradistinguished from opinion) and universal truth: which last is either metaphysical or geometrical, either purely intellectual or perfectly abstracted. On the power of discerning truth depends that of acting with the view of an end; a circumstance essential to virtue. Of virtue, considered in the divine mind as a perpetual and universal beneficence. Of human virtue, considered as a system of particular sentiments and actions, suitable to the design of providence and the condition of man; to whom it constitutes the chief good and the first beauty. Of vice and its origin. Of ridicule: its general nature and final cause. Of the passions; particularly of those which relate to evil natural or moral, and which are generally accounted painful, though not always unattended with pleasure. Thus far of beauty and the pleasing forms Which man's untutor'd fancy, from the scenes Imperfect of this ever-changing world, Creates; and views, inamor'd. Now my song Severer themes demand: mysterious truth; And virtue, sovran good: the spells, the trains, The progeny of error: the dread sway Of passion; and whatever hidden stores From her own lofty deeds and from herself The mind acquires. Severer argument: Not less attractive; nor deserving less A constant ear. For what are all the forms Educ'd by fancy from corporeal things, Greatness, or pomp, or symmetry of parts? Not tending to the heart, soon feeble grows, As the blunt arrow 'gainst the knotty trunk, Their impulse on the sense: while the pall'd eye Expects in vain its tribute; asks in vain, Where are the ornaments it once admir'd? Not so the moral species, nor the powers Of passion and of thought. the ambitious mind With objects boundless as her own desires Can there converse: by these unfading forms Touch'd and awaken'd still, with eager act She bends each nerve, and meditates well-pleas'd Her gifts, her godlike fortune. Such the scenes Now opening round us. May the destin'd verse Maintain its equal tenor, though in tracts Obscure and arduous. may the source of light All-present, all sufficient, guide our steps Through every maze: and whom in childish years From the loud throng, the beaten paths of wealth And power, thou did'st apart send forth to speak In tuneful words concerning highest things, Him still do thou, o father, at those hours Of pensive freedom, when the human soul Shuts out the rumour of the world, him still Touch thou with secret lessons: call thou back Each erring thought; and let the yielding strains From his full bosom, like a welcome rill Spontaneous from its healthy fountain, flow. But from what name, what favorable sign, What heavenly auspice, rather shall i date My perilous excursion, than from truth, That nearest inmate of the human soul; Estrang'd from whom, the countenance divine Of man disfigur'd and dishonor'd sinks Among inferior things? For to the brutes Perception and the transient boons of sense Hath fate imparted: but to man alone Of sublunary beings was it given Each fleeting impulse on the sensual powers At leisure to review; with equal eye To scan the passion of the stricken nerve Or the vague object striking: to conduct From sense, the portal turbulent and loud, Into the mind's wide palace one by one The frequent, pressing, fluctuating forms, And question and compare them. Thus he learns Their birth and fortunes; how allied they haunt The avenues of sense; what laws direct Their union; and what various discords rise, Or fix'd or casual: which when his clear thought Retains and when his faithful words express, That living image of the external scene, As in a polish'd mirror held to view, Is truth: where'er it varies from the shape And hue of its exemplar, in that part Dim error lurks. Moreover, from without When oft the same society of forms In the same order have approach'd his mind, He deigns no more their steps with curious heed To trace; no more their features or their garb He now examines; but of them and their Condition, as with some diviner's tongue, Affirms what heaven in every distant place, Through every future season, will decree. This too is truth: where'er his prudent lips Wait till experience diligent and slow Has authoriz'd their sentence, this is truth; A second, higher kind: the parent this Of science; or the lofty power herself, Science herself: on whom the wants and cares Of social life depend; the substitute Of God's own wisdom in this toilsome world; The providence of man. Yet oft in vain, To earn her aid, with fix'd and anxious eye He looks on nature's and on fortune's course: Too much in vain. His duller visual ray The stillness and the persevering acts Of nature oft elude; and fortune oft With step fantastic from her wonted walk Turns into mazes dim. his sight is foil'd; And the crude sentence of his faltering tongue Is but opinion's verdict, half believ'd And prone to change. Here thou, who feel'st thine ear Congenial to my lyre's profounder tone, Pause, and be watchful. Hitherto the stores, Which feed thy mind and exercise her powers, Partake the relish of their native soil, Their parent earth. But know, a nobler dower Her sire at birth decreed her; purer gifts From his own treasure; forms which never deign'd In eyes or ears to dwell, within the sense Of earthly organs; but sublime were plac'd In his essential reason, leading there That vast ideal host which all his works Through endless ages never will reveal. Thus then indow'd, the feeble creature man, The slave of hunger and the prey of death, Even now, even here, in earth's dim prison bound, The language of intelligence divine Attains; repeating oft concerning one And many, pass'd and present, parts and whole, Those sovran dictates which in farthest heaven, Where no orb rowls, eternity's fix'd ear Hears from coeval truth, when chance nor change, Nature's loud progeny, nor nature's self Dares intermeddle or approach her throne. Ere long, o'er this corporeal world he learns To extend her sway; while calling from the deep, From earth and air, their multitudes untold Of figures and of motions round his walk, For each wide family some single birth He sets in view, the impartial type of all Its brethren; suffering it to claim, beyond Their common heritage, no private gift, No proper fortune. Then whate'er his eye In this discerns, his bold unerring tongue Pronounceth of the kindred, without bound, Without condition. Such the rise of forms Sequester'd far from sense and every spot Peculiar in the realms of space or time: Such is the throne which man for truth amid The paths of mutability hath built Secure, unshaken, still; and whence he views, In matter's mouldering structures, the pure forms Of triangle or circle, cube or cone, Impassive all; whose attributes nor force Nor fate can alter. There he first conceives True being, and an intellectual world The same this hour and ever. Thence he deems Of his own lot; above the painted shapes That fleeting move o'er this terrestrial scene Looks up; beyond the adamantine gates Of death expatiates; as his birthright claims Inheritance in all the works of God; Prepares for endless time his plan of life, And counts the universe itself his home. Whence also but from truth, the light of minds, Is human fortune gladden'd with the rays Of virtue? with the moral colors thrown On every walk of this our social scene, Adorning for the eye of gods and men The passions, actions, habitudes of life, And rendering earth like heaven, a sacred place Where love and praise may take delight to dwell? Let none with heedless tongue from truth disjoin The reign of virtue. Ere the dayspring flow'd, Like sisters link'd in concord's golden chain, They stood before the great eternal mind, Their common parent; and by him were both Sent forth among his creatures, hand in hand, Inseparably join'd: nor e'er did truth Find an apt ear to listen to her lore, Which knew not virtue's voice; nor, save where truth's Majestic words are heard and understood, Doth virtue deign to inhabit. Go, inquire Of nature: not among Tartarian rocks, Whither the hungry vulture with its prey Returns: not where the lion's sullen roar At noon resounds along the lonely banks Of ancient Tigris: but her gentler scenes, The dove-cote and the shepherd's fold at morn, Consult; or by the meadow's fragrant hedge, In spring-time when the woodlands first are green, Attend the linnet singing to his mate Couch'd o'er their tender young. To this fond care Thou dost not virtue's honorable name Attribute: wherefore, save that not one gleam Of truth did e'er discover to themselves Their little hearts, or teach them, by the effects Of that parental love, the love itself To judge, and measure its officious deeds? But man, whose eyelids truth has fill'd with day, Discerns how skilfully to bounteous ends His wise affections move; with free accord Adopts their guidance; yields himself secure To nature's prudent impulse; and converts Instinct to duty and to sacred law. Hence right and sit on earth: while thus to man The almighty legislator hath explain'd The springs of action fix'd within his breast; Hath given him power to slacken or restrain Their effort; and hath shewn him how they join Their partial movements with the master wheel Of the great world, and serve that sacred end Which he, the unerring reason, keeps in view. For (if a mortal tongue may speak of him And his dread ways) even as his boundless eye, Connecting every form and every change, Beholds the perfect beauty; so his will, Through every hour producing good to all The family of creatures, is itself The perfect virtue. Let the grateful swain Remember this, as oft with joy and praise He looks upon the falling dews which clothe His lawns with verdure, and the tender seed Nourish within his furrows: when between Dead seas and burning skies, where long unmov'd The bark had languish'd, now a rustling gale Lists o'er the fickle waves her dancing prow, Let the glad pilot, bursting out in thanks, Remember this: lest blind o'erweening pride Pollute their offerings: lest their selfish heart Say to the heavenly ruler, “At our call “Relents thy power: by us thy arm is mov'd.” Fools! who of God as of each other deem: Who his invariable acts deduce From sudden counsels transient as their own; Nor farther of his bounty, than the event Which haply meets their loud and eager prayer, Acknowledge; nor, beyond the drop minute Which haply they have tasted, heed the source That flows for all; the fountain of his love Which, from the summit where he sits inthron'd, Pours health and joy, unfailing streams, throughout The spacious region flourishing in view, The goodly work of his eternal day, His own fair universe; on which alone His counsels fix, and whence alone his will Assumes her strong direction. Such is now His sovran purpose: such it was before All multitude of years. For his right arm Was never idle: his bestowing love Knew no beginning; was not as a change Of mood that woke at last and started up After a deep and solitary sloth Of boundless ages. No: he now is good, He ever was. The feet of hoary time Through their eternal course have travell'd o'er No speechless, lifeless desart; but through scenes Cheerful with bounty still; among a pomp Of worlds, for gladness round the maker's throne Loud-shouting, or, in many dialects Of hope and filial trust, imploring thence The fortunes of their people: where so fix'd Were all the dates of being, so dispos'd To every living soul of every kind The field of motion and the hour of rest, That each the general happiness might serve; And, by the discipline of laws divine Convinc'd of folly or chastiz'd from guilt, Each might at length be happy. What remains Shall be like what is pass'd; but fairer still, And still increasing in the godlike gifts Of life and truth. The same paternal hand, From the mute shell-fish gasping on the shore, To men, to angels, to celestial minds, Will ever lead the generations on Through higher scenes of being: while, supply'd From day to day by his inlivening breath, Inferior orders in succession rise To fill the void below. As flame ascends, As vapors to the earth in showers return, As the pois'd ocean toward the attracting moon Swells, and the ever-listening planets charm'd By the sun's call their onward pace incline, So all things which have life aspire to God, Exhaustless fount of intellectual day, Center of souls. Nor doth the mastering voice Of nature cease within to prompt aright Their steps; nor is the care of heaven witheld From sending to the toil external aid; That in their stations all may persevere To climb the ascent of being, and approach For ever nearer to the life divine. But this eternal fabric was not rais'd For man's inspection. Though to some be given To catch a transient visionary glimpse Of that majestic scene which boundless power Prepares for perfect goodness, yet in vain Would human life her faculties expand To imbosom such an object. Nor could e'er Virtue or praise have touch'd the hearts of men, Had not the sovran guide, through every stage Of this their various journey, pointed out New hopes, new toils, which to their humble sphere Of sight and strength might such importance hold As doth the wide creation to his own. Hence all the little charities of life, With all their duties: hence that favorite palm Of human will, when duty is suffic'd, And still the liberal soul in ampler deeds Would manifest herself; that sacred sign Of her rever'd affinity to him Whose bounties are his own; to whom none said “Create the wisest, fullest, fairest world, “And make its offspring happy;” who, intent Some likeness of himself among his works To view, hath pour'd into the human breast A ray of knowledge and of love, which guides Earth's feeble race to act their maker's part, Self-judging, self-oblig'd: while, from before That godlike function, the gigantic power Necessity, though wont to curb the force Of Chaos and the savage elements, Retires abash'd, as from a scene too high For her brute tyranny, and with her bears Her scorned followers, terror, and base awe Who blinds herself, and that ill-suited pair, Obedience link'd with hatred. Then the soul Arises in her strength; and, looking round Her busy sphere, whatever work she views, Whatever counsel bearing any trace Of her creator's likeness, whether apt To aid her fellows or preserve herself In her superior functions unimpair'd, Thither she turns exulting: that she claims As her peculiar good: on that, through all The fickle seasons of the day, she looks With reverence still: to that, as to a fence Against affliction and the darts of pain, Il se fit une migration (the author is speaking of what happened on the revocation of the edict of Nantes) dont on n'avoit guere vu d'exemples dans l'histoire: un peuple entier sortit du royaume par l'esprit de parti en haine du pape, &amp; pour recevoir sous un autre ciel la communion sous les deux especes: quatre cens mille ames s'expatrierent ainsi &amp; abandonnerent tous leur biens pour detonner dans d'autres temples les vieux pseaumes de Clement Marot. Her drooping hopes repair: and, once oppos'd To that, all other pleasure, other wealth Vile, as the dross upon the molten gold, Appears, and loathsome as the briny sea To him who languishes with thirst and sighs For some known fountain pure. For what can strive With virtue? Which of nature's regions vast Can in so many forms produce to sight Such powerful beauty? beauty, which the eye Of hatred cannot look upon secure: Which envy's self contemplates, and is turn'd Ere long to tenderness, to infant smiles, Or tears of humblest love. Is aught so fair In all the dewy landscapes of the spring, The summer's noontide groves, the purple eve At harvest-home, or in the frosty moon Glittering on some smooth sea, is aught so fair As virtuous friendship? as the honor'd roof Whither from highest heaven immortal Love His torch ethereal and his golden bow Propitious brings, and there a temple holds To whose unspotted service gladly vow'd The social band of parent, brother, child, With smiles and sweet discourse and gentle deeds Adore his power? What gift of richest clime E'er drew such eager eyes, or prompted such Deep wishes, as the zeal that snatcheth back From slander's poisonous tooth a foe's renown; Or crosseth danger in his lion walk, A rival's life to rescue? as the young Athenian warrior sitting down in bonds, That his great father's body might not want A peaceful, humble tomb? the Roman wife Teaching her lord how harmless was the wound Of death, how impotent the tyrant's rage, Who nothing more could threaten to afflict Their faithful love? Or is there in the abyss, Is there, among the adamantine spheres Wheeling unshaken through the boundless void, Aught that with half such majesty can fill The human bosom, as when Brutus rose Refulgent from the stroke of Cæsar's fate Amid the croud of patriots; and, his arm Aloft extending like eternal Jove When guilt brings down the thunder, call'd aloud On Tully's name, and shook the crimson sword. Of justice in his rapt astonish'd eye, And bade the father of his country hail, For lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust, And Rome again is free? Thus, through the paths Of human life, in various pomp array'd Walks the wise daughter of the judge of heaven, Fair virtue; from her father's throne supreme Sent down to utter laws, such as on earth Most apt he knew, most powerful to promote The weal of all his works, the gracious end Of his dread empire. And though haply man's Obscurer sight, so far beyond himself And the brief labors of his little home, Extends not; yet, by the bright presence won Of this divine instructress, to her sway Pleas'd he assents, nor heeds the distant goal To which her voice conducts him. Thus hath God, Still looking toward his own high purpose, fix'd The virtues of his creatures; thus he rules The parent's fondness and the patriot's zeal; Thus the warm sense of honor and of shame; The vows of gratitude, the faith of love; And all the comely intercourse of praise, The joy of human life, the earthly heaven. How far unlike them must the lot of guilt Be found! Or what terrestrial woe can match The self-convicted bosom, which hath wrought The bane of others or inslav'd itself With shackles vile? Not poison, nor sharp fire, Nor the worst pangs that ever monkish hate Suggested, or despotic rage impos'd, Were at that season an unwish'd exchange: When the soul loaths herself: when, flying thence To crouds, on every brow she sees portray'd Fell demons, hate or scorn, which drive her back To solitude, her judge's voice divine To hear in secret, haply sounding through The troubled dreams of midnight, and still, still Demanding for his violated laws Fit recompence, or charging her own tongue To speak the award of justice on herself. For well she knows what faithful hints within Were whisper'd, to beware the lying forms Which turn'd her footsteps from the safer way: What cautions to suspect their painted dress, And look with steady eyelid on their smiles, Their frowns, their tears. In vain. the dazzling hues Of fancy, and opinion's eager voice, Too much prevail'd. For mortals tread the path In which opinion says they follow good Or fly from evil: and opinion gives Report of good or evil, as the scene Was drawn by fancy, pleasing or deform'd: Thus her report can never there be true Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye With glaring colors and distorted lines. Is there a man to whom the name of death Brings terror's ghastly pageants conjur'd up Before him, death-bed groans, and dismal vows, And the frail soul plung'd headlong from the brink Of life and daylight down the gloomy air, An unknown depth, to gulphs of torturing fire Unvisited by mercy? Then what hand Can snatch this dreamer from the fatal toils Which fancy and opinion thus conspire To twine around his heart? or who shall hush Their clamor, when they tell him that to die, To risk those horrors, is a direr curse Than basest life can bring? Though love with prayers Most tender, with affliction's sacred tears, Beseech his aid; though gratitude and faith Condemn each step which loiters; yet let none Make answer for him that, if any frown Of danger thwart his path, he will not stay, Content, and be a wretch to be secure. Here vice begins then: at the gate of life, Ere the young multitude to diverse roads Part, like fond pilgrims on a journey unknown, Sits fancy, deep inchantress; and to each With kind maternal looks presents her bowl, A potent beverage. Heedless they comply: Till the whole soul from that mysterious draught Is ting'd, and every transient thought imbibes Of gladness or disgust, desire or fear, One homebred color: which not all the lights Of science e'er shall change; not all the storms Of adverse fortune wash away, nor yet The robe of purest virtue quite conceal. Thence on they pass, where meeting frequent shapes Of good and evil, cunning phantoms apt To fire or freeze the breast, with them they join In dangerous parley; listening oft, and oft Gazing with reckless passion, while its garb The spectre heightens, and its pompous tale Repeats with some new circumstance to suit That early tincture of the hearer's soul. And should the guardian, reason, but for one Short moment yield to this illusive scene His ear and eye, the intoxicating charm Involves him, till no longer he discerns, Or only guides to err. Then revel forth A furious band that spurn him from the throne, And all is uproar. Hence ambition climbs With sliding feet and hands impure, to grasp Those solemn toys which glitter in his view On fortune's rugged steep: hence pale revenge Unsheaths her murderous dagger: rapine hence And envious lust, by venal fraud upborne, Surmount the reverend barrier of the laws Which kept them from their prey: hence all the crimes That e'er defil'd the earth, and all the plagues That follow them for vengeance, in the guise Of honor, safety, pleasure, ease, or pomp, Stole first into the fond believing mind. Yet not by fancy's witchcraft on the brain Are always the tumultuous passions driven To guilty deeds, nor reason bound in chains That vice alone may lord it. Oft, adorn'd With motley pageants, folly mounts his throne, And plays her ideot antics, like a queen. A thousand garbs she wears: a thousand ways She whirls her giddy empire. Lo, thus far With bold adventure to the Mantuan lyre I sing for contemplation link'd with love A pensive theme. Now haply should my song Unbend that serious countenance, and learn Thalia's tripping gait, her shrill-ton'd voice, Her wiles familiar: whether scorn she darts In wanton ambush from her lip or eye, Or whether with a sad disguise of care O'ermantling her gay brow, she acts in sport The deeds of folly, and from all sides round Calls forth impetuous laughter's gay rebuke; Her province. But through every comic scene To lead my Muse with her light pencil arm'd; Through every swift occasion which the hand Of laughter points at, when the mirthful sting Distends her laboring sides and chokes her tongue; Were endless as to sound each grating note With which the rooks, and chattering daws, and grave Unwieldy inmates of the village pond, The changing seasons of the sky proclaim; Sun, cloud, or shower. Suffice it to have said, Where'er the power of ridicule displays Her quaint ey'd visage, some incongruous form, Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd, Strikes on her quick perception: whether pomp, Or praise, or beauty be dragg'd in and shown Where sordid fashions, where ignoble deeds, Where foul deformity is wont to dwell; Or whether these with shrewd and wayward spite Invade resplendent pomp's imperious mien, The charms of beauty, or the boast of praise. Ask we for what fair end the almighty sire In mortal bosoms stirs this gay contempt, These grateful pangs of laughter; from disgust Educing pleasure? Wherefore, but to aid The tardy steps of reason, and at once By this prompt impulse urge us to depress Wild folly's aims? For though the sober light Of truth slow-dawning on the watchful mind At length unfolds, through many a subtile tie, How these uncouth disorders end at last In public evil; yet benignant heaven, Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears To thousands, conscious what a scanty pause From labor and from care the wider lot Of humble life affords for studious thought To scan the maze of nature, therefore stamp'd These glaring scenes with characters of scorn, As broad, as obvious to the passing clown As to the letter'd sage's curious eye. But other evils o'er the steps of man Through all his walks impend; against whose might The slender darts of laughter nought avail: A trivial warfare. Some, like cruel guards, On nature's ever-moving throne attend; With mischief arm'd for him whoe'er shall thwart The path of her inexorable wheels, While she pursues the work that must be done Through ocean, earth, and air. Hence frequent forms Of woe; the merchant, with his wealthy bark, Bury'd by dashing waves; the traveller Pierc'd by the pointed lightening in his haste; And the poor husbandman, with folded arms, Surveying his lost labors, and a heap Of blasted chaff the product of the field Whence he expected bread. But worse than these I deem, far worse, that other race of ills Which human kind rear up among themselves; That horrid offspring which misgovern'd will Bears to fantastic error; vices, crimes, Furies that curse the earth, and make the blows, The heaviest blows, of nature's innocent hand Seem sport: which are indeed but as the care Of a wise parent, who sollicits good To all her house, though haply at the price Of tears and froward wailing and reproach From some unthinking child, whom not the less Its mother destines to be happy still. These sources then of pain, this double lot Of evil in the inheritance of man, Requir'd for his protection no slight force, No careless watch. and therefore was his breast Fenc'd round with passions quick to be alarm'd, Or stubborn to oppose; with fear, more swift Than beacons catching flame from hill to hill, Where armies land; with anger, uncontroul'd As the young lion bounding on his prey; With sorrow, that locks up the struggling heart, And shame, that overcasts the drooping eye As with a cloud of lightening. These the part Perform of eager monitors, and goad The soul more sharply than with points of steel, Her enemies to shun or to resist. And as those passions, that converse with good, Are good themselves; as hope and love and joy, Among the fairest and the sweetest boons Of life, we rightly count; so these, which guard Against invading evil, still excite Some pain, some tumult: these, within the mind Too oft admitted or too long retain'd, Shock their frail seat, and by their uncurb'd rage To savages more fell than Libya breeds Transform themselves: till human thought becomes A gloomy ruin, haunt of shapes unbless'd, Of self-tormenting fiends; horror, despair, Hatred, and wicked envy: foes to all The works of nature and the gifts of heaven. But when through blameless paths to righteous ends Those keener passions urge the awaken'd soul, I would not, as ungracious violence, Their sway describe, nor from their free career The fellowship of pleasure quite exclude. For what can render, to the self-approv'd, Their temper void of comfort, though in pain? Who knows not with what majesty divine The forms of truth and justice to the mind Appear, ennobling oft the sharpest woe With triumph and rejoicing? Who, that bears A human bosom, hath not often felt How dear are all those ties which bind our race In gentleness together, and how sweet Their force, let fortune's wayward hand the while Be kind or cruel? Ask the faithful youth Why the cold urn, of her whom long he lov'd, So often fills his arms; so often draws His lonely footsteps, silent and unseen, To pay the mournful tribute of his tears? O! he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds Should ne'er seduce his bosom to forego Those sacred hours when, stealing from the noise Of care and envy, sweet remembrance sooths With virtue's kindest looks his aking breast, And turns his tears to rapture? Ask the croud, Which flies impatient from the village walk To climb the neighbouring cliffs, when far below The savage winds have hurl'd upon the coast Some helpless bark; while holy pity melts. The general eye, or terror's icy hand Smites their distorted limbs and horrent hair; While every mother closer to her breast Catcheth her child, and, pointing where the waves Foam through the shatter'd vessel, shrieks aloud As one poor wretch, who spreads his piteous arms For succour, swallow'd by the roaring surge, As now another, dash'd against the rock, Drops lifeless down. o! deemest thou indeed No pleasing influence here by nature given To mutual terror and compassion's tears? No tender charm mysterious, which attracts O'er all that edge of pain the social powers To this their proper action and their end? Ask thy own heart; when, at the midnight hour, Slow through that pensive gloom thy pausing eye, Led by the glimmering taper, moves around The reverend volumes of the dead, the songs Of Grecian bards, and records writ by fame For Grecian heroes, where the sovran power Of heaven and earth surveys the immortal page Even as a father meditating all The praises of his son, and bids the rest Of mankind there the fairest model learn Of their own nature, and the noblest deeds Which yet the world hath seen. If then thy soul Join in the lot of those diviner men; Say, when the prospect darkens on thy view; When, sunk by many a wound, heroic states Mourn in the dust and tremble at the frown Of hard ambition; when the generous band Of youths who fought for freedom and their sires Lie side by side in death; when brutal force Usurps the throne of justice, turns the pomp Of guardian power, the majesty of rule, The sword, the laurel, and the purple robe, To poor dishonest pageants, to adorn A robber's walk, and glitter in the eyes Of such as bow the knee; when beauteous works, Rewards of virtue, sculptur'd forms which deck'd With more than human grace the warrior's arch Or patriot's tomb, now victims to appease Tyrannic envy, strew the common path With awful ruins; when the Muse's haunt; The marble porch where wisdom wont to talk With Socrates or Tully, hears no more Save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks, Or female superstition's midnight prayer; When ruthless havoc from the hand of time Tears the destroying scythe, with surer stroke. To mow the monuments of glory down; Till desolation o'er the grass-grown street Expands her raven wings, and, from the gate. Where senates once the weal of nations plann'd, Hisseth the gliding snake through hoary weeds That clasp the mouldering column: thus when all The widely-mournful scene is fix'd within Thy throbbing bosom; when the patriot's tear Starts from thine eye, and thy extended arm In fancy hurls the thunderbolt of Jove To fire the impious wreath on Philip's brow, Or dash Octavius from the trophied car; Say, doth thy secret soul repine to taste The big distress? or wouldst thou then exchange Those heart-ennobling sorrows for the lot Of him who sits amid the gaudy herd Of silent flatterers bending to his nod, And o'er them, like a giant, casts his eye, And says within himself, “I am a king, “And wherefore should the clamorous voice of woe “Intrude upon mine ear?” The dregs corrupt Of barbarous ages, that Circæan draught Of servitude and folly, have not yet, Bless'd be the eternal ruler of the world! Yet have not so dishonor'd, so deform'd The native judgement of the human soul, Nor so effac'd the image of her sire. THE END OF BOOK THE SECOND. BOOK THE THIRD. What tongue then may explain the various fate Which reigns o'er earth? or who to mortal eyes Illustrate this perplexing labyrinth Of joy and woe through which the feet of man Are doom'd to wander? That eternal mind From passions, wants and envy far estrang'd, Who built the spacious universe, and deck'd Each part so richly with whate'er pertains To life, to health, to pleasure; why bade he The viper Evil, creeping in, pollute The goodly scene, and with insidious rage, While the poor inmate looks around and smiles, Dart her fell sting with poison to his soul? Hard is the question, and from ancient days Hath still oppress'd with care the sage's thought; Hath drawn forth accents from the poet's lyre Too sad, too deeply plaintive: nor did e'er. Those chiefs of human kind, from whom the light Of heavenly truth first gleam'd on barbarous lands, Forget this dreadful secret when they told What wonderous things had to their favor'd eyes And ears on cloudy mountain been reveal'd, Or in deep cave by nymph or power divine, Portentous oft and wild. Yet one i know, Could i the speech of lawgivers assume, One old and splendid tale i would record With which the Muse of Solon in sweet strains Adorn'd this theme profound, and render'd all Its darkness, all its terrors, bright as noon, Or gentle as the golden star of eve. Who knows not Solon? last, and wisest far, Of those whom Greece triumphant in the height Of glory, styl'd her fathers? him whose voice Through Athens hush'd the storm of civil wrath; Taught envious want and cruel wealth to join In friendship; and, with sweet compulsion, tam'd Minerva's eager people to his laws, Which their own goddess in his breast inspir'd? 'Twas now the time when his heroic task Seem'd but perform'd in vain: when sooth'd by years Of flattering service, the fond multitude Hung with their sudden counsels on the breath Of great Pisistratus: that chief renown'd, Whom Hermes and the Idalian queen had train'd Even from his birth to every powerful art Of pleasing and persuading: from whose lips Flow'd eloquence which like the vows of love Could steal away suspicion from the hearts Of all who listen'd. Thus from day to day He won the general suffrage, and beheld Each rival overshadow'd and depress'd Beneath his ampler state: yet oft complain'd, As one less kindly treated, who had hop'd To merit favor, but submits perforce To find another's services preferr'd, Nor yet relaxeth aught of faith or zeal. Then tales were scatter'd of his envious foes, Of snares that watch'd his fame, of daggers aim'd Against his life. At last with trembling limbs, His hair diffus'd and wild, his garments loose, And stain'd with blood from self-inflicted wounds, He burst into the public place, as there, There only, were his refuge; and declar'd In broken words, with sighs of deep regret, The mortal danger he had scarce repell'd. Fir'd with his tragic tale, the indignant croud, To guard his steps, forthwith a menial band, Array'd beneath his eye for deeds of war, Decree. O still too liberal of their trust, And oft betray'd by over-grateful love, The generous people! Now behold him fenc'd By mercenary weapons, like a king, Forth issuing from the city gate at eve To seek his rural mansion, and with pomp Crouding the public road. the swain stops short, And sighs: the officious townsmen stand at gaze And shrinking give the sullen pageant room. Yet not the less obsequious was his brow; Nor less profuse of courteous words his tongue, Of gracious gifts his hand: the while by stealth, Like a small torrent fed with evening showers, His train increas'd. till, at that fatal time Just as the public eye, with doubt and shame Startled, began to question what it saw, Swift as the sound of earthquakes rush'd a voice Through Athens, that Pisistratus had fill'd The rocky citadel with hostile arms, Had barr'd the steep ascent, and sate within Amid his hirelings, meditating death To all whose stubborn necks his yoke refus'd. Where then was Solon? After ten long years Of absence, full of haste from foreign shores The sage, the lawgiver had now arriv'd: Arriv'd, alass, to see that Athens, that Fair temple rais'd by him and sacred call'd To liberty and concord, now profan'd By savage hate, or sunk into a den Of slaves who crouch beneath the master's scourge, And deprecate his wrath and court his chains. Yet did not the wise patriot's grief impede His virtuous will, nor was his heart inclin'd One moment with such woman-like distress To view the transient storms of civil war, As thence to yield his country and her hopes To all-devouring bondage. His bright helm, Even while the traitor's impious act is told, He buckles on his hoary head: he girds With mail his stooping breast: the shield, the spear He snatcheth; and with swift indignant strides The assembled people seeks: proclaims aloud It was no time for counsel: in their spears Lay all their prudence now: the tyrant yet Was not so firmly seated on his throne, But that one shock of their united force Would dash him from the summit of his pride Headlong and groveling in the dust. What else Can re-assert the lost Athenian name So cheaply to the laughter of the world Betray'd; by guile beneath an infant's faith So mock'd and scorn'd? Away then: freedom now And safety, dwell not but with fame in arms: Myself will shew you where their mansion lies, And through the walks of danger or of death Conduct you to them. While he spake, through all Their crouded ranks his quick sagacious eye He darted; where no cheerful voice was heard Of social daring; no stretch'd arm was seen Hastening their common task: but pale mistrust Wrinkled each brow: they shook their heads, and down Their slack hands hung: cold sighs and whisper'd doubts From breath to breath stole round. The sage mean time Look'd speechless on, while his big bosom heav'd Struggling with shame and sorrow: till at last A tear broke forth; and, O immortal shades, O Theseus, he exclaim'd, o Codrus, where, Where are ye now? behold for what ye toil'd Through life? behold for whom ye chose to die. No more he added; but with lonely steps Weary and slow, his silver beard depress'd, And his stern eyes bent heedless on the ground, Back to his silent dwelling he repair'd. There o'er the gate, his armor, as a man Whom from the service of the war his chief Dismisseth after no inglorious toil, He fix'd in general view. One wishful look He sent, unconscious, toward the public place At parting: then beneath his quiet roof Without a word, without a sigh, retir'd. Scarce had the morrow's sun his golden rays From sweet Hymettus darted o'er the fanes Of Cecrops to the Salaminian shores, When, lo, on Solon's threshold met the feet Of four Athenians by the same sad care Conducted all: than whom the state beheld None nobler. First came Megacles, the son Of great Alcmæon, whom the Lydian king The mild, unhappy Crœsus, in his days Of glory had with costly gifts adorn'd, Fair vessels, splendid garments, tinctur'd webs And heaps of treasur'd gold beyond the lot Of many sovrans; thus requiting well That hospitable favor which erewhile Alcmæon to his messengers had shewn, Whom he with offerings worthy of the God Sent from his throne in Sardis to revere Apollo's Delphic shrine. With Megacles Approach'd his son, whom Agarista bore, The virtuous child of Clisthenes whose hand Of Grecian scepters the most ancient far In Sicyon sway'd: but greater fame he drew From arms controul'd by justice, from the love Of the wise Muses, and the unenvied wreath Which glad Olympia gave. For thither once His warlike steeds the heroe led, and there Contended through the tumult of the course With skillful wheels. Then victor at the goal, Amid the applauses of assembled Greece, High on his car he stood and wav'd his arm. Silence insu'd: when strait the herald's voice Was heard, inviting every Grecian youth, Whom Clisthenes content might call his son, To visit, ere twice thirty days were pass'd, The towers of Sicyon. there the chief decreed, Within the circuit of the following year, To join at Hymen's altar, hand in hand With his fair daughter, him among the guests Whom worthiest he should deem. Forthwith from all The bounds of Greece the ambitious wooers came: From rich Hesperia; from the Illyrian shore Where Epidamnus over Adria's surge Looks on the setting sun; from those brave tribes Chaonian or Molossian whom the race Of great Achilles governs, glorying still In Troy o'erthrown; from rough Ætolia, nurse Of men who first among the Greeks threw off The yoke of kings, to commerce and to arms Devoted; from Thessalia's fertile meads, Where flows Penéus near the lofty walls Of Cranon old; from strong Eretria, queen Of all Eubœan cities, who, sublime On the steep margin of Euripus, views Across the tide the Marathonian plain, Not yet the haunt of glory. Athens too, Minerva's care, among her graceful sons Found equal lovers for the princely maid: Nor was proud Argos wanting; nor the domes Of sacred Elis; nor the Arcadian groves That overshade Alphéus, echoing oft Some shepherd's song. But through the illustrious band Was none who might with Megacles compare In all the honors of unblemish'd youth. His was the beauteous bride: and now their son Young Clisthenes, betimes, at Solon's gate Stood anxious; leaning forward on the arm Of his great sire, with earnest eyes that ask'd When the slow hinge would turn, with restless feet, And cheeks now pale, now glowing: for his heart Throbb'd, full of bursting passions, anger, grief With scorn imbitter'd, by the generous boy Scarce understood, but which, like noble seeds, Are destin'd for his country and himself In riper years to bring forth fruits divine Of liberty and glory. Next appear'd Two brave companions whom one mother bore To different lords; but whom the better ties Of firm esteem and friendship render'd more Than brothers: first Miltiades, who drew From godlike Æacus his ancient line; That Æacus whose unimpeach'd renown For sanctity and justice won the lyre Of elder bards to celebrate him thron'd In Hades o'er the dead, where his decrees The guilty soul within the burning gates Of Tartarus compel, or send the good To inhabit with eternal health and peace The vallies of Elysium. From a stem So sacred, ne'er could worthier scyon spring Than this Miltiades; whose aid erelong The chiefs of Thrace, already on their ways Sent by the inspir'd foreknowing maid who sits Upon the Delphic tripod, shall implore To wield their sceptre, and the rural wealth Of fruitful Chersonesus to protect With arms and laws. But, nothing careful now Save for his injur'd country, here he stands In deep sollicitude with Cymon join'd: Unconscious both what widely-different lots Await them, taught by nature as they are To know one common good, one common ill. For Cimon not his valor, not his birth Deriv'd from Codrus, not a thousand gifts Dealt round him with a wise, benignant hand, No, not the Olympic olive by himself From his own brow transferr'd to sooth the mind Of this Pisistratus, can long preserve From the fell envy of the tyrant's sons, And their assassin dagger. But if death Obscure upon his gentle steps attend, Yet fate an ample recompense prepares In his victorious son, that other great Miltiades, who o'er the very throne Of glory shall with Time's assiduous hand In adamantine characters ingrave The name of Athens; and, by freedom arm'd 'Gainst the gigantic pride of Asia's king, Shall all the achievements of the heroes old Surmount, of Hercules, of all who sail'd From Thessaly with Jason, all who fought For empire or for fame at Thebes or Troy. Such were the patriots who within the porch Of Solon had assembled. But the gate Now opens, and across the ample floor Strait they proceed into an open space Bright with the beams of morn: a verdant spot, Where stands a rural altar, pil'd with sods Cut from the grassy turf and girt with wreaths Of branching palm. Here Solon's self they found Clad in a robe of purple pure, and deck'd With leaves of olive on his reverend brow. He bow'd before the altar, and o'er cakes Of barley from two earthen vessels pour'd Of honey and of milk a plenteous stream; Calling meantime the Muses to accept His simple offering, by no victim ting'd With blood, nor sullied by destroying fire, But such as for himself Apollo claims In his own Delos, where his favorite haunt Is thence the Altar of the Pious nam'd. Unseen the guests drew near, and silent view'd That worship; till the heroe priest his eye Turn'd toward a seat on which prepar'd there lay A branch of laurel. Then his friends confess'd Before him stood. Backward his step he drew, As loth that care or tumult should approach Those early rites divine: but soon their looks, So anxious, and their hands, held forth with such Desponding gesture, bring him on perforce To speak to their affliction. Are ye come, He cried, to mourn with me this common shame? Or ask ye some new effort which may break Our fetters? Know then, of the public cause Not for yon traitor's cunning or his might Do i despair: nor could i wish from Jove Aught dearer, than at this late hour of life, As once by laws, so now by strenuous arms, From impious violation to assert The rights our fathers left us. But, alas! What arms? or who shall wield them? Ye beheld The Athenian people. Many bitter days Must pass, and many wounds from cruel pride Be felt, ere yet their partial hearts find room For just resentment, or their hands indure To smite this tyrant brood, so near to all Their hopes, so oft admir'd, so long belov'd. That time will come, however. Be it yours To watch its fair approach, and urge it on With honest prudence: me it ill beseems Again to supplicate the unwilling croud To rescue from a vile deceiver's hold That envied power which once with eager zeal They offer'd to myself; nor can i plunge In counsels deep and various, nor prepare For distant wars, thus faultering as i tread On life's last verge, erelong to join the shades Of Minos and Lycurgus. But behold What care imploys me now. My vows i pay To the sweet Muses, teachers of my youth And solace of my age. If right i deem Of the still voice that whispers at my heart, The immortal sisters have not quite withdrawn Their old harmonious influence. Let your tongues With sacred silence favor what i speak, And haply shall my faithful lips be taught To unfold celestial counsels, which may arm As with impenetrable steel your breasts For the long strife before you, and repel The darts of adverse fate. He said, and snatch'd The laurel bough, and sate in silence down, Fix'd, wrapp'd in solemn musing, full before The sun, who now from all his radiant orb Drove the gray clouds, and pour'd his genial light Upon the breast of Solon. Solon rais'd Aloft the leafy rod, and thus began. Ye beauteous offspring of Olympian Jove And Memory divine, Pierian maids, Hear me, propitious. In the morn of life, When hope shone bright and all the prospect smil'd, To your sequester'd mansion oft my steps Were turn'd, o Muses, and within your gate My offerings paid. Ye taught me then with strains Of flowing harmony to soften war's Dire voice, or in fair colors, that might charm The public eye, to clothe the form austere Of civil counsel. Now my feeble age Neglected, and supplanted of the hope On which it lean'd, yet sinks not, but to you, To your mild wisdom flies, refuge belov'd Of solitude and silence. Ye can teach The visions of my bed whate'er the gods In the rude ages of the world inspir'd, Or the first heroes acted: ye can make The morning light more gladsome to my sense Than ever it appear'd to active youth Pursuing careless pleasure: ye can give To this long leisure, these unheeded hours, A labor as sublime, as when the sons Of Athens throng'd and speechless round me stood To hear pronounc'd for all their future deeds The bounds of right and wrong. Celestial powers, I feel that ye are near me: and behold, To meet your energy divine, i bring A high and sacred theme; not less than those Which to the eternal custody of fame Your lips intrusted, when of old ye deign'd With Orpheus or with Homer to frequent The groves of Hæmus or the Chian shore. Ye know, harmonious maids, (for what of all My various life was e'er from you estrang'd?) Oft hath my solitary song to you Reveal'd that duteous pride which turn'd my steps To willing exile; earnest to withdraw From envy and the disappointed thirst Of lucre, lest the bold familiar strife, Which in the eye of Athens they upheld Against her legislator, should impair With trivial doubt the reverence of his laws. To Egypt therefore through the Ægean isles My course i steer'd, and by the banks of Nile Dwelt in Canopus. Thence the hallow'd domes Of Saïs, and the rites to Isis paid, I sought, and in her temple's silent courts, Through many changing moons, attentive heard The venerable Sonchis, while his tongue At morn or midnight the deep story told Of her who represents whate'er has been, Or is, or shall be; whose mysterious veil No mortal hand hath ever yet remov'd. By him exhorted, southward to the walls Of On i pass'd, the city of the sun, The ever-youthful god. 'Twas there amid His priests and sages, who the live-long night Watch the dread movements of the starry sphere, Or who in wonderous fables half disclose The secrets of the elements, 'twas there That great Psenophis taught my raptur'd ears The fame of old Atlantis, of her chiefs, And her pure laws, the first which earth obey'd. Deep in my bosom sunk the noble tale; And often, while i listen'd, did my mind Foretell with what delight her own free lyre Should sometime for an Attic audience raise Anew that lofty scene, and from their tombs Call forth those ancient demigods to speak. Of justice and the hidden providence That walks among mankind. But yet meantime The mystic pomp of Ammon's gloomy sons Became less pleasing. With contempt i gaz'd On that tame garb and those unvarying paths To which the double yoke of king and priest Had cramp'd the sullen race. At last with hymns Invoking our own Pallas and the gods Of cheerful Greece, a glad farewell i gave To Egypt, and before the southern wind Spread my full sails. What climes i then survey'd, What fortunes i incounter'd in the realm Of Crœsus or upon the Cyprian shore, The Muse, who prompts my bosom, doth not now Consent that i reveal. But when at length Ten times the sun returning from the south Had strow'd with flowers the verdant earth and fill'd The groves with music, pleas'd i then beheld The term of those long errors drawing nigh. Nor yet, i said, will i sit down within The walls of Athens, till my feet have trod The Cretan soil, have pierc'd those reverend haunts Whence law and civil concord issued forth As from their ancient home, and still to Greece Their wisest, loftiest discipline proclaim. Strait where Amnisus, mart of wealthy ships, Appears beneath fam'd Cnossus and her towers Like the fair handmaid of a stately queen, I check'd my prow, and thence with eager steps The city of Minos enter'd. O ye gods, Who taught the leaders of the simpler time By written words to curb the untoward will Of mortals, how within that generous isle Have ye the triumphs of your power display'd Munificent! Those splendid merchants, lords Of traffic and the sea, with what delight I saw them at their public meal, like sons Of the same household, join the plainer sort Whose wealth was only freedom! whence to these Vile envy, and to those fantastic pride, Alike was strange; but noble concord still Cherish'd the strength untam'd, the rustic faith, Of their first fathers. Then the growing race, How pleasing to behold them in their schools, Their sports, their labors, ever plac'd within, O shade of Minos, thy controuling eye! Here was a docile band in tuneful tones Thy laws pronouncing, or with lofty hymns Praising the bounteous gods, or, to preserve Their country's heroes from oblivious night, Resounding what the Muse inspir'd of old; There, on the verge of manhood, others met, In heavy armor through the heats of noon To march, the rugged mountains height to climb With measur'd swiftness, from the hard-bent bow To send resistless arrows to their mark, Or for the fame of prowess to contend, Now wrestling, now with fists and staves oppos'd, Now with the biting falchion, and the fence Of brazen shields; while still the warbling flute Presided o'er the combat, breathing strains Grave, solemn, soft; and changing headlong spite To thoughtful resolution cool and clear. Such i beheld those islanders renown'd, So tutor'd from their birth to meet in war Each bold invader, and in peace to guard That living flame of reverence for their laws Which nor the storms of fortune, nor the flood Of foreign wealth diffus'd o'er all the land, Could quench or slacken. First of human names In every Cretan's heart was Minos still; And holiest far, of what the sun surveys Through his whole course, were those primeval seats Which with religious footsteps he had taught Their sires to approach; the wild Dictæan cave Where Jove was born; the ever-verdant meads Of Ida, and the spacious grotto, where His active youth he pass'd, and where his throne Yet stands mysterious; whither Minos came Each ninth returning year, the king of gods And mortals there in secret to consult On justice, and the tables of his law To inscribe anew. Oft also with like zeal Great Rhea's mansion from the Cnossian gates Men visit; nor less oft the antique fane Built on that sacred spot, along the banks Of shady Theron, where benignant Jove And his majestic consort join'd their hands And spoke their nuptial vows. Alass, 'twas there That the dire fame of Athens sunk in bonds I first receiv'd; what time an annual feast Had summon'd all the genial country round, By sacrifice and pomp to bring to mind That first great spousal; while the inamor'd youths And virgins, with the priest before the shrine, Observe the same pure ritual and invoke The same glad omens. There, among the croud Of strangers from those naval cities drawn Which deck, like gems, the island's northern shore, A merchant of Ægina i descried, My ancient host. but, forward as i sprung To meet him, he, with dark dejected brow, Stopp'd half-averse; and, O Athenian guest, He said, art thou in Crete; these joyful rites Partaking? Know thy laws are blotted out: Thy country kneels before a tyrant's throne. He added names of men, with hostile deeds Disastrous; which obscure and indistinct I heard: for, while he spake, my heart grew cold And my eyes dim: the altars and their train No more were present to me: how i far'd, Or whither turn'd, i know not; nor recall Aught of those moments other than the sense Of one who struggles in oppressive sleep And, from the toils of some distressful dream To break away, with palpitating heart, Weak limbs, and temples bath'd in death-like dew, Makes many a painful effort. When at last The sun and nature's face again appear'd, Not far I found me; where the public path, Winding through cypress groves and swelling meads, From Cnossus to the cave of Jove ascends. Heedless i follow'd on; till soon the skirts Of Ida rose before me, and the vault Wide-opening pierc'd the mountain's rocky side. Entering within the threshold, on the ground I flung me, sad, faint, overworn with toil, BOOK THE FOURTH. One effort more, one cheerful sally more, Our destin'd course will finish. and in peace Then, for an offering sacred to the powers Who lent us gracious guidance, we will then Inscribe a monument of deathless praise, O my adventurous song. With steady speed Long hast thou, on an untried voyage bound, Sail'd between earth and heaven: hast now survey'd, Stretch'd out beneath thee, all the mazy tracts Of passion and opinion; like a waste Of sands and flowery lawns and tangling woods, Where mortals roam bewilder'd: and hast now Exulting soar'd among the worlds above, Or hover'd near the eternal gates of heaven, If haply the discourses of the Gods, A curious, but an unpresuming guest, Thou might'st partake, and carry back some strain Of divine wisdom, lawful to repeat, And apt to be conceiv'd of man below. A different task remains; the secret paths Of early genius to explore: to trace Those haunts where Fancy her predestin'd sons, Like to the Demigods of old, doth nurse Remote from eyes profane. Ye happy souls Who now her tender discipline obey, Where dwell ye? What wild river's brink at eve Imprint your steps? What solemn groves at noon Use ye to visit, often breaking forth In rapture 'mid your dilatory walk, Or musing, as in slumber, on the green? —Would i again were with you!—O ye dales Of Tyne, and ye most ancient woodlands; where Oft as the giant flood obliquely strides, And his banks open, and his lawns extend, Stops short the pleased traveller to view Presiding o'er the scene some rustic tower Founded by Norman or by Saxon hands: O ye Northumbrian shades, which overlook The rocky pavement and the mossy falls Of solitary Wensbeck's limpid stream; How gladly i recall your well-known seats Belov'd of old, and that delightful time When all alone, for many a summer's day, I wander'd through your calm recesses, led In silence by some powerful hand unseen. Nor will i e'er forget you. nor shall e'er The graver tasks of manhood, or the advice Of vulgar wisdom, move me to disclaim Those studies which possess'd me in the dawn Of life, and fix'd the color of my mind For every future year: whence even now From sleep i rescue the clear hours of morn, And, while the world around lies overwhelm'd In idle darkness, am alive to thoughts Of honourable fame, of truth divine Or moral, and of minds to virtue won By the sweet magic of harmonious verse; The themes which now expect us. For thus far On general habits, and on arts which grow Spontaneous in the minds of all mankind, Hath dwelt our argument; and how self-taught, Though seldom conscious of their own imploy, In nature's or in fortune's changeful scene Men learn to judge of beauty, and acquire Those forms set up, as idols in the soul For love and zealous praise. Yet indistinct, In vulgar bosoms, and unnotic'd lie These pleasing stores, unless the casual force Of things external prompt the heedless mind To recognize her wealth. But some there are Conscious of nature, and the rule which man O'er nature holds: some who, within themselves Retiring from the trivial scenes of chance And momentary passion, can at will Call up these fair exemplars of the mind; Review their features; scan the secret laws Which bind them to each other: and display By forms, or sounds, or colours, to the sense Of all the world their latent charms display: Even as in nature's frame (if such a word, If such a word, so bold, may from the lips Of man proceed) as in this outward frame Of things, the great artificer pourtrays His own immense idea. Various names These among mortals bear, as various signs They use, and by peculiar organs speak To human sense. These are who by the flight Of air through tubes with moving stops distinct, Or by extended chords in measure taught To vibrate, can assemble powerful sounds Expressing every temper of the mind From every cause, and charming all the soul With passion void of care. Others mean time The rugged mass of metal, wood, or stone Patiently taming; or with easier hand Describing lines, and with more ample scope Uniting colors; can to general sight Produce those permanent and perfect forms, Those characters of heroes and of gods, Which from the crude materials of the world Their own high minds created. But the chief Are poets; eloquent men, who dwell on earth To clothe whate'er the soul admires or loves With language and with numbers. Hence to these A field is open'd wide as nature's sphere; Nay, wider: various as the sudden acts Of human wit, and vast as the demands Of human will. The bard nor length, nor depth, Nor place, nor form controuls. To eyes, to ears, To every organ of the copious mind, He offereth all its treasures. Him the hours, The seasons him obey: and changeful Time Sees him at will keep measure with his flight, At will outstrip it. To enhance his toil, He summoneth from the uttermost extent Of things which God hath taught him, every form Auxiliar, every power; and all beside Excludes imperious. His prevailing hand Gives, to corporeal essence, life and sense And every stately function of the soul. The soul itself to him obsequious lies, Like matter's passive heap; and as he wills, To reason and affection he assigns Their just alliances, their just degrees: Whence his peculiar honors; whence the race Of men who people his delightful world, Men genuine and according to themselves, Transcend as far the uncertain sons of earth, As earth itself to his delightful world The palm of spotless beauty doth resign. ODES ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS. IN TWO BOOKS. ODES, BOOK THE FIRST. ODE I. PREFACE. I On yonder verdant hilloc laid, Where oaks and elms, a friendly shade, O'erlook the falling stream, O master of the Latin lyre, Awhile with thee will i retire From summer's noontide beam. II And, lo, within my lonely bower, The industrious bee from many a flower Collects her balmy dews: “For me,” she sings, “the gems are born, “For me their silken robe adorn, “Their fragrant breath diffuse.” III Sweet murmurer! may no rude storm This hospitable scene deform, Nor check thy gladsome toils; Still may the buds unsullied spring, Still showers and sunshine court thy wing To these ambrosial spoils. IV Nor shall my Muse hereafter fail Her fellow-labourer thee to hail; And lucky be the strains! For long ago did nature frame Your seasons and your arts the same, Your pleasures and your pains. V Like thee, in lowly, sylvan scenes, On river-banks and flowery greens My Muse delighted plays; Nor through the desart of the air, Though swans or eagles triumph there, With fond ambition strays. VI Nor where the boding raven chaunts, Nor near the owl's unhallow'd haunts Will she her cares imploy; But flies from ruins and from tombs, From superstition's horrid glooms, To day-light and to joy. VII Nor will she tempt the barren waste; Nor deigns the lurking strength to taste Of any noxious thing; But leaves with scorn to envy's use The insipid nightshade's baneful juice, The nettle's sordid sting. VIII From all which nature fairest knows, The vernal blooms, the summer rose, She draws her blameless wealth; And, when the generous task is done, She consecrates a double boon, To pleasure and to health. ODE II. ON THE WINTER-SOLSTICE, M.D.CC.XL. I The radiant ruler of the year At length his wintry goal attains; Soon to reverse the long career, And northward bend his steady reins. Now, piercing half Potosi's height, Prone rush the fiery floods of light Ripening the mountain's silver stores: While, in some cavern's horrid shade, The panting Indian hides his head, And oft the approach of eve implores. II But lo, on this deserted coast How pale the sun! how thick the air! Mustering his storms, a sordid host, Lo, winter desolates the year, The fields resign their latest bloom; No more the breezes waft perfume, No more the streams in music roll: But snows fall dark, or rains resound; And, while great nature mourns around, Her griefs infect the human soul. III Hence the loud city's busy throngs Urge the warm bowl and splendid fire: Harmonious dances, festive songs Against the spiteful heaven conspire. Meantime perhaps with tender fears Some village-dame the curfew hears, While round the hearth her children play: At morn their father went abroad; The moon is sunk and deep the road; She sighs, and wonders at his stay. IV But thou, my lyre, awake, arise, And hail the sun's returning force: Even now he climbs the northern skies, And health and hope attend his course. Then louder howl the aërial waste, Be earth with keener cold imbrac'd, Yet gentle hours advance their wing; And fancy, mocking winter's might, With flowers and dews and streaming light Already decks the newborn spring. V O fountain of the golden day, Could mortal vows promote thy speed, How soon before thy vernal ray Should each unkindly damp recede! How soon each hovering tempest fly, Whose stores for mischief arm the sky, Prompt on our heads to burst amain, To rend the forest from the steep, Or, thundering o'er the Baltic deep, To whelm the merchant's hopes of gain! VI But let not man's unequal views Presume o'er nature and her laws: 'Tis his with grateful joy to use The indulgence of the sovran cause; Secure that health and beauty springs Through this majestic frame of things, Beyond what he can reach to know; And that heaven's all-subduing will, With good the progeny of ill, Attempereth every state below. VII How pleasing wears the wintry night, Spent with the old illustrious dead! While, by the taper's trembling light, I seem those awful scenes to tread Where chiefs or legislators lie, Whose triumphs move before my eye In arms and antique pomp array'd; While now i taste the Ionian song, Now bend to Plato's godlike tongue Resounding through the olive shade. VIII But should some cheerful, equal friend Bid leave the studious page awhile, Let mirth on wisdom then attend, And social ease on learned toil. Then while, at love's uncareful shrine, Each dictates to the god of wine Her name whom all his hopes obey, What flattering dreams each bosom warm, While absence, heightening every charm, Invokes the slow-returning May! IX May, thou delight of heaven and earth, When will thy genial star arise? The auspicious morn, which gives thee birth, Shall bring Eudora to my eyes. Within her sylvan haunt behold, As in the happy garden old, She moves like that primeval fair: Thither, ye silver-sounding lyres, Ye tender smiles, ye chaste desires, Fond hope and mutual faith, repair. X And if believing love can read His better omens in her eye, Then shall my fears, o charming maid, And every pain of absence die: Then shall my jocund harp, attun'd To thy true ear, with sweeter sound Pursue the free Horatian song: Old Tyne shall listen to my tale, And echo, down the bordering vale, The liquid melody prolong. ODE III. TO A FRIEND, UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOVE. I Indeed, my Phædria, if to find That wealth can female wishes gain Had e'er disturb'd your thoughtful mind, Or cost one serious moment's pain, I should have said that all the rules, You learn'd of moralists and schools, Were very useless, very vain. II Yet i perhaps mistake the case— Say, though with this heroic air, Like one that holds a nobler chace, You try the tender loss to bear, Does not your heart renounce your tongue? Seems not my censure strangely wrong To count it such a slight affair? III When Hesper gilds the shaded sky, Oft as you seek the well-known grove, Methinks i see you cast your eye Back to the morning scenes of love: Each pleasing word you heard her say, Her gentle look, her graceful way, Again your struggling fancy move. IV Then tell me, is your soul intire? Does wisdom calmly hold her throne? Then can you question each desire, Bid this remain, and that begone? No tear half-starting from your eye? No kindling blush you know not why? No stealing sigh, nor stifled groan? V Away with this unmanly mood! See where the hoary churl appears, Whose hand hath seiz'd the favorite good Which you reserv'd for happier years: While, side by side, the blushing maid Shrinks from his visage, half-afraid, Spite of the sickly joy she wears. VI Ye guardian powers of love and fame, This chaste, harmonious pair behold; And thus reward the generous flame Of all who barter vows for gold. O bloom of youth, o tender charms Well-buried in a dotard's arms! O equal price of beauty sold! VII Cease then to gaze with looks of love: Bid her adieu, the venal fair: Unworthy she your bliss to prove; Then wherefore should she prove your care? No: lay your myrtle garland down; And let awhile the willow's crown With luckier omens bind your hair. VIII O just escap'd the faithless main, Though driven unwilling on the land; To guide your favor'd steps again, Behold your better genius stand: Where truth revolves her page divine, Where virtue leads to honor's shrine, Behold, he lifts his awful hand. IX Fix but on these your ruling aim, And time, the sire of manly care, Will fancy's dazzling colors tame A soberer dress will beauty wear: Then shall esteem by knowledge led Inthrone within your heart and head Some happier love, some truer fair. ODE IV. AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE. TO THE SAME. I Yes: you contemn the perjur'd maid Who all your favorite hopes betray'd: Nor, though her heart should home return, Her tuneful tongue it's falsehood mourn, Her winning eyes your faith implore, Would you her hand receive again, Or once dissemble your disdain, Or listen to the syren's theme, Or stoop to love: since now esteem And confidence, and friendship, is no more. II Yet tell me, Phædria, tell me why, When summoning your pride you try To meet her looks with cool neglect, Or cross her walk with slight respect, (For so is falsehood best repaid) Whence do your cheeks indignant glow? Why is your struggling tongue so slow? What means that darkness on your brow? As if with all her broken vow You meant the fair apostate to upbraid? ODE V. AGAINST SUSPICION. I Oh fly! 'tis dire Suspicion's mien; And, meditating plagues unseen, The sorceress hither bends: Behold her torch in gall imbrued: Behold—her garment drops with blood Of lovers and of friends. II Fly far! Already in your eyes I see a pale suffusion rise; And soon through every vein, Soon will her secret venom spread, And all your heart and all your head Imbibe the potent stain. III Then many a demon will she raise To vex your sleep, to haunt your ways; While gleams of lost delight Raise the dark tempest of the brain, As lightning shines across the main Through whirlwinds and through night. IV No more can faith or candor move; But each ingenuous deed of love, Which reason would applaud, Now, smiling o'er her dark distress, Fancy malignant strives to dress Like injury and fraud. V Farewell to virtue's peaceful times: Soon will you stoop to act the crimes Which thus you stoop to fear: Guilt follows guilt: and where the train Begins with wrongs of such a stain, What horrors form the rear! VI 'Tis thus to work her baleful power, Suspicion waits the sullen hour Of fretfulness and strife, When care the infirmer bosom wrings, Or Eurus waves his murky wings To damp the seats of life. VII But come, forsake the scene unbless'd Which first beheld your faithful breast To groundless fears a prey: Come, where with my prevailing lyre The skies, the streams, the groves conspire To charm your doubts away. VIII Thron'd in the sun's descending car, What power unseen diffuseth far This tenderness of mind? What genius smiles on yonder flood? What god, in whispers from the wood, Bids every thought be kind? IX O thou, whate'er thy awful name, Whose wisdom our untoward frame With social love restrains; Thou, who by fair affection's ties Giv'st us to double all our joys And half disarm our pains; X Let universal candor still, Clear as yon heaven-reflecting rill, Preserve my open mind; Nor this nor that man's crooked ways One sordid doubt within me raise To injure human kind. ODE VI. HYMN TO CHEERFULNESS. How thick the shades of evening close! How pale the sky with weight of snows! Haste, light the tapers, urge the fire, And bid the joyless day retire. —Alas, in vain i try within To brighten the dejected scene, While rouz'd by grief these fiery pains Tear the frail texture of my veins; While winter's voice, that storms around, And yon deep death-bell's groaning sound Renew my mind's oppressive gloom, Till starting horror shakes the room. Is there in nature no kind power To sooth affliction's lonely hour? To blunt the edge of dire disease, And teach these wintry shades to please? Come, Cheerfulness, triumphant fair, Shine through the hovering cloud of care: O sweet of language, mild of mien, O virtue's friend and pleasure's queen, Asswage the flames that burn my breast, Compose my jarring thoughts to rest; And while thy gracious gifts i feel, My song shall all thy praise reveal. As once ('twas in Astræa's reign) The vernal powers renew'd their train, It happen'd that immortal Love Was ranging through the spheres above, And downward hither cast his eye The year's returning pomp to spy. He saw the radiant god of day, Waft in his car the rosy May; The fragrant Airs and genial Hours Were shedding round him dews and flowers; Before his wheels Aurora pass'd, And Hesper's golden lamp was last. But, fairest of the blooming throng, When Health majestic mov'd along, Delighted to survey below The joys which from her presence flow, While earth enliven'd hears her voice, And swains, and flocks, and fields rejoice; Then mighty Love her charms confess'd, And soon his vows inclin'd her breast, And, known from that auspicious morn, The pleasing Cheerfulness was born. Thou, Cheerfulness, by heaven design'd To sway the movements of the mind, Whatever fretful passion springs, Whatever wayward fortune brings To disarrange the power within, And strain the musical machine; Thou, Goddess, thy attempering hand Doth each discordant string command, Refines the soft, and swells the strong; And, joining nature's general song, Through many a varying tone unfolds The harmony of human souls. Fair guardian of domestic life, Kind banisher of homebred strife, Nor sullen lip, nor taunting eye Deforms the scene where thou art by: No sickening husband damns the hour Which bound his joys to female power; No pining mother weeps the cares Which parents waste on thankless heirs: The officious daughters pleas'd attend; The brother adds the name of friend: By thee with flowers their board is crown'd, With songs from thee their walks resound; And morn with welcome lustre shines, And evening unperceiv'd declines. Is there a youth, whose anxious heart Labors with love's unpitied smart? Though now he stray by rills and bowers, And weeping waste the lonely hours, Or if the nymph her audience deign, Debase the story of his pain With slavish looks, discolor'd eyes, And accents faltering into sighs; Yet thou, auspicious power, with ease Can'st yield him happier arts to please, Inform his mien with manlier charms, Instruct his tongue with nobler arms, With more commanding passion move, And teach the dignity of love. Friend to the Muse and all her train, For thee i court the Muse again: The Muse for thee may well exert Her pomp, her charms, her fondest art, Who owes to thee that pleasing sway Which earth and peopled heaven obey. Let melancholy's plaintive tongue Repeat what later bards have sung; But thine was Homer's ancient might, And thine victorious Pindar's flight: Thy hand each Lesbian wreathe attir'd: Thy lip Sicilian reeds inspir'd: Thy spirit lent the glad perfume Whence yet the flowers of Teos bloom; Whence yet from Tibur's Sabine vale Delicious blows the inlivening gale, While Horace calls thy sportive choir, Heroes and nymphs, around his lyre. But see where yonder pensive sage (A prey perhaps to fortune's rage, Perhaps by tender griefs oppress'd, Or glooms congenial to his breast) Retires in desart scenes to dwell, And bids the joyless world farewell. Alone he treads the autumnal shade, Alone beneath the mountain laid He sees the nightly damps ascend, And gathering storms aloft impend; He hears the neighbouring surges roll, And raging thunders shake the pole: Then, struck by every object round, And stunn'd by every horrid sound, He asks a clue for nature's ways; But evil haunts him through the maze: He sees ten thousand demons rise To wield the empire of the skies, And chance and fate assume the rod, And malice blot the throne of God. —O thou, whose pleasing power i sing, Thy lenient influence hither bring; Compose the storm, dispell the gloom, Till nature wear her wonted bloom, Till fields and shades their sweets exhale, And music swell each opening gale: Then o'er his breast thy softness pour, And let him learn the timely hour To trace the world's benignant laws, And judge of that presiding cause Who founds on discord beauty's reign, Converts to pleasure every pain, Subdues each hostile form to rest, And bids the universe be bless'd. O thou, whose pleasing power i sing, If right i touch the votive string, If equal praise i yield thy name, Still govern thou thy poet's flame; Still with the Muse my bosom share, And sooth to peace intruding care. But most exert thy pleasing power On friendship's consecrated hour; And while my Sophron points the road To godlike wisdom's calm abode, Or warm in freedom's ancient cause Traceth the source of Albion's laws, Add thou o'er all the generous toil The light of thy unclouded smile. But, if by fortune's stubborn sway From him and friendship torn away, I court the Muse's healing spell For griefs that still with absence dwell, Do thou conduct my fancy's dreams To such indulgent placid themes, As just the struggling breast may cheer And just suspend the starting tear, Yet leave that sacred sense of woe Which none but friends and lovers know. ODE VII. ON THE USE OF POETRY. I Not for themselves did human kind Contrive the parts by heaven assign'd On life's wide scene to play: Not Scipio's force, nor Cæsar's skill Can conquer glory's arduous hill, If fortune close the way. II Yet still the self-depending soul, Though last and least in fortune's roll, His proper sphere commands; And knows what nature's seal bestow'd, And sees, before the throne of God, The rank in which he stands. III Who train'd by laws the future age, Who rescu'd nations from the rage Of partial, factious power, My heart with distant homage views; Content if thou, celestial Muse, Did'st rule my natal hour. IV Nor far beneath the hero's feet, Nor from the legislator's seat Stands far remote the bard. Though not with public terrors crown'd, Yet wider shall his rule be found, More lasting his award. V Lycurgus fashion'd Sparta's fame, And Pompey to the Roman name Gave universal sway: Where are they?—Homer's reverend page Holds empire to the thirtieth age, And tongues and climes obey. VI And thus when William's acts divine No longer shall from Bourbon's line Draw one vindictive vow; When Sidney shall with Cato rest, And Russel move the patriot's breast No more than Brutus now; VII Yet then shall Shakespeare's powerful art O'er every passion, every heart, Confirm his awful throne: Tyrants shall bow before his laws; And freedom's, glory's, virtue's cause, Their dread assertor own. ODE VIII. ON LEAVING HOLLAND. I. 1. Farewell to Leyden's lonely bound, The Belgian Muse's sober seat; Where dealing frugal gifts around To all the favorites at her feet, She trains the body's bulky frame For passive, persevering toils; And lest, from any prouder aim, The daring mind should scorn her homely spoils, She breathes maternal fogs to damp its restless flame. 2. Farewell the grave, pacific air, Where never mountain zephyr blew: The marshy levels lank and bare, Which Pan, which Ceres never knew: The Naiads, with obscene attire, Urging in vain their urns to flow; While round them chaunt the croking choir, And haply sooth some lover's prudent woe, Or prompt some restive bard and modulate his lyre. 3. Farewell, ye nymphs, whom sober care of gain Snatch'd in your cradles from the god of love: She render'd all his boasted arrows vain; And all his gifts did he in spite remove. Ye too, the slow-ey'd fathers of the land, With whom dominion steals from hand to hand, Unown'd, undignify'd by public choice, I go where liberty to all is known, And tells a monarch on his throne, He reigns not but by her preserving voice. II. 1. O my lov'd England, when with thee Shall i sit down, to part no more? Far from this pale, discolor'd sea, That sleeps upon the reedy shore, When shall i plough thy azure tide? When on thy hills the flocks admire, Like mountain snows; till down their side I trace the village and the sacred spire, While bowers and copses green the golden slope divide? 2. La crainte donna le jour à la credulité, &amp; l'amour propre interessa bientot le ciel au destin des hommes.Ye nymphs who guard the pathless grove, Ye blue-ey'd sisters of the streams, With whom i wont at morn to rove, With whom at noon i talk'd in dreams; O! take me to your haunts again, The rocky spring, the greenwood glade; To guide my lonely footsteps deign, To prompt my slumbers in the murmuring shade, And sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain. 3. And thou, my faithful harp, no longer mourn Thy drooping master's inauspicious hand: Now brighter skies and fresher gales return, Now fairer maids thy melody demand. Daughters of Albion, listen to my lyre! O Phœbus, guardian of the Aonian choir, Why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own, When all the virgin deities above With Venus and with Juno move In concert round the Olympian father's throne? III. 1. Thee too, protectress of my lays, Elate with whose majestic call Above degenerate Latium's praise, Above the slavish boast of Gaul, I dare from impious thrones reclaim, And wanton sloth's ignoble charms, The honors of a poet's name To Somers' counsels, or to Hamden's arms, Thee, freedom, I rejoin, and bless thy genuine flame, 2. Great citizen of Albion. Thee Heroic valour still attends, And useful science pleas'd to see How art her studious toil extends. While truth, diffusing from on high A lustre unconfin'd as day, Fills and commands the public eye; Till, pierc'd and sinking by her powerful ray, Tame faith and monkish awe, like nightly demons, fly. 3. Hence the whole land the patriot's ardour shares: Hence dread religion dwells with social joy; And holy passions and unsullied cares, In youth, in age, domestic life imploy. O fair Britannia, hail!—With partial love The tribes of men their native seats approve, Unjust and hostile to each foreign fame: But when for generous minds and manly laws A nation holds her prime applause, There public zeal shall all reproof disclaim. ODE IX. TO CURIO. MDCCXLIV. I Thrice hath the spring beheld thy faded fame Since i exulting grasp'd the tuneful shell: Eager through endless years to sound thy name, Proud that my memory with thine should dwell. How hast thou stain'd the splendor of my choice! Those godlike forms which hover'd round thy voice, Laws, freedom, glory, whither are they flown? What can I now of thee to time report, Save thy fond country made thy impious sport, Her fortune and her hope the victims of thy own? II There are with eyes unmov'd and reckless heart Who saw thee from thy summit fall thus low, Who deem'd thy arm extended but to dart The public vengeance on thy private foe. But, spite of every gloss of envious minds, The owl-ey'd race whom virtue's lustre blinds, Who sagely prove that each man hath his price, I still believ'd thy aim from blemish free, I yet, even yet, believe it, spite of thee And all thy painted pleas to greatness and to vice. III “Thou didst not dream of liberty decay'd, “Nor wish to make her guardian laws more strong: “But the rash many, first by thee misled, “Bore thee at length unwillingly along.” Rise from your sad abodes, ye curst of old For faith deserted or for cities sold, Own here one untry'd, unexampled, deed; One mystery of shame from Curio learn, To beg the infamy he did not earn, And scape in guilt's disguise from virtue's offer'd meed. IV For saw we not that dangerous power avow'd Whom freedom oft hath found her mortal bane, Whom public wisdom ever strove to exclude, And but with blushes suffereth in her train? Corruption vaunted her bewitching spoils, O'er court, o'er senate, spread in pomp her toils, And called herself the states directing soul: Till Curio, like a good magician, try'd With eloquence and reason at his side, By strength of holier spells the inchantress to controul. V Soon with thy country's hope thy fame extends: The rescu'd merchant oft thy words resounds: Thee and thy cause the rural hearth defends: His bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns: The learn'd recluse, with awful zeal who read Of Grecian heroes, Roman patriots dead, Now with like awe doth living merit scan: While he, whom virtue in his blest retreat Bade social ease and public passions meet, Ascends the civil scene, and knows to be a man. VI At length in view the glorious end appear'd: We saw thy spirit thro' the senate reign; And freedom's friends thy instant omen heard Of laws for which their fathers bled in vain. Wak'd in the strife the public Genius rose More keen, more ardent from his long repose: Deep through her bounds the city felt his call: Each crouded haunt was stirr'd beneath his power, And murmuring challeng'd the deciding hour Of that too vast event, the hope and dread of all. VII O ye good powers who look on human kind, Instruct the mighty moments as they rowl; And watch the fleeting shapes in Curio's mind, And steer his passions steady to the goal. O Alfred, father of the English name, O valiant Edward, first in civil fame, O William, height of public virtue pure, Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye Behold the sum of all your labors nigh, Your plans of law complete, your ends of rule secure. VIII 'Twas then—O shame! O soul from faith estrang'd! O Albion oft to flattering vows a prey! 'Twas then—Thy thought what sudden frenzy chang'd? What rushing palsy took thy strength away? Is this the man in freedom's cause approv'd? The man so great, so honour'd, so belov'd? Whom the dead envy'd and the living bless'd? This patient slave by tinsel bonds allur'd? This wretched suitor for a boon abjur'd? Whom those that fear'd him, scorn; that trusted him, detest? IX O lost alike to action and repose! With all that habit of familiar fame, Sold to the mockery of relentless foes, And doom'd to exhaust the dregs of life in shame, To act with burning brow and throbbing heart A poor deserter's dull exploded part, To slight the favor thou canst hope no more, Renounce the giddy croud, the vulgar wind, Charge thy own lightness on thy country's mind, And from her voice appeal to each tame foreign shore. X But England's sons, to purchase thence applause, Shall ne'er the loyalty of slaves pretend, By courtly passions try the public cause; Nor to the forms of rule betray the end. O race erect! by manliest passions mov'd, The labors which to virtue stand approv'd, Prompt with a lover's fondness to survey; Yet, where injustice works her wilful claim, Fierce as the flight of Jove's destroying flame, Impatient to confront, and dreadful to repay. XI These thy heart owns no longer. In their room See the grave queen of pageants, Honor, dwell Couch'd in thy bosom's deep tempestuous gloom Like some grim idol in a sorcerer's cell. Before her rites thy sickening reason flew, Divine persuasion from thy tongue withdrew, While laughter mock'd, or pity stole a sigh: Can wit her tender movements rightly frame Where the prime function of the soul is lame? Can fancy's feeble springs the force of truth supply? XII But come: 'tis time: strong destiny impends To shut thee from the joys thou hast betray'd: With princes fill'd, the solemn fane ascends, By Infamy, the mindful demon sway'd. There vengeful vows for guardian laws effac'd, From nations fetter'd, and from towns laid waste, For ever through the spacious courts resound: There long posterity's united groan And the sad charge of horrors not their own, Assail the giant chiefs, and press them to the ground. XIII In sight old Time, imperious judge, awaits: Above revenge, or fear, or pity, just, He urgeth onward to those guilty gates The Great, the Sage, the Happy, and August. And still he asks them of the hidden plan Whence every treaty, every war began, Evolves their secrets and their guilt proclaims: And still his hands despoil them on the road Of each vain wreath by lying bards bestow'd, And crush their trophies huge, and rase their sculptur'd names. XIV Ye mighty shades, arise, give place, attend: Here his eternal mansion Curio seeks: —Low doth proud Wentworth to the stranger bend, And his dire welcome hardy Clifford speaks: “He comes, whom fate with surer arts prepar'd “To accomplish all which we but vainly dar'd; “Whom o'er the stubborn herd she taught to reign: “Who sooth'd with gaudy dreams their raging power “Even to it's last irrevocable hour; “Then baffled their rude strength, and broke them to the chain.” XV But ye, whom yet wise liberty inspires, Whom for her champions o'er the world she claims, (That household godhead whom of old your sires Sought in the woods of Elbe and bore to Thames) Drive ye this hostile omen far away; Their own fell efforts on her foes repay; Your wealth, your arts, your fame, be her's alone: Still gird your swords to combat on her side; Still frame your laws her generous test to abide; And win to her defence the altar and the throne. XVI Protect her from yourselves, ere yet the flood Of golden luxury, which commerce pours, Hath spread that selfish fierceness through your blood, Which not her lightest discipline indures: Snatch from fantastic demagogues her cause: Dream not of Numa's manners, Plato's laws: A wiser founder, and a nobler plan, O sons of Alfred, were for you assign'd: Bring to that birthright but an equal mind, And no sublimer lot will fate reserve for man. ODE X. TO THE MUSE. I Queen of my songs, harmonious maid, Ah why hast thou withdrawn thy aid? Ah why forsaken thus my breast With inauspicious damps oppress'd? Where is the dread prophetic heat, With which my bosom wont to beat? Where all the bright mysterious dreams Of haunted groves and tuneful streams, That woo'd my genius to divinest themes? II Say, goddess, can the festal board, Or young Olympia's form ador'd; Say, can the pomp of promis'd fame Relume thy faint, thy dying flame? Or have melodious airs the power To give one free, poetic hour? Or, from amid the Elysian train, The soul of Milton shall i gain, To win thee back with some celestial strain? III O powerful strain! o sacred soul! His numbers every sense controul: And now again my bosom burns; The Muse, the Muse herself returns. Such on the banks of Tyne, confess'd, I hail'd the fair immortal guest, When first she seal'd me for her own, Made all her blissful treasures known, And bade me swear to follow Her alone. ODE XI. ON LOVE, TO A FRIEND. I No, foolish youth—To virtuous fame If now thy early hopes be vow'd, If true ambition's nobler flame Command thy footsteps from the croud, Lean not to love's inchanting snare; His songs, his words, his looks beware, Nor join his votaries, the young and fair. II By thought, by dangers, and by toils, The wreath of just renown is worn; Nor will ambition's awful spoils The flowery pomp of ease adorn: But love unbends the force of thought; By love unmanly fears are taught; And love's reward with gaudy sloth is bought. III Yet thou hast read in tuneful lays, And heard from many a zealous breast, The pleasing tale of beauty's praise In wisdom's lofty language dress'd; Of beauty powerful to impart Each finer sense, each comelier art, And sooth and polish man's ungentle heart. IV If then, from love's deceit secure, Thus far alone thy wishes tend, Go; see the white-wing'd evening hour On Delia's vernal walk descend: Go, while the golden light serene, The grove, the lawn, the soften'd scene Becomes the presence of the rural queen. V Attend, while that harmonious tongue Each bosom, each desire commands: Apollo's lute by Hermes strung And touch'd by chaste Minerva's hands, Attend. I feel a force divine, O Delia, win my thoughts to thine; That half the color of thy life is mine. VI Yet conscious of the dangerous charm, Soon would i turn my steps away; Nor oft provoke the lovely harm, Nor lull my reason's watchful sway. But thou, my friend—i hear thy sighs: Alass, i read thy downcast eyes; And thy tongue falters; and thy color flies. VII So soon again to meet the fair? So pensive all this absent hour? —O yet, unlucky youth, beware, While yet to think is in thy power. In vain with friendship's flattering name Thy passion veils its inward shame; Friendship, the treacherous fuel of thy flame! VIII Once, i remember, new to love, And dreading his tyrannic chain, I sought a gentle maid to prove What peaceful joys in friendship reign: Whence we forsooth might safely stand, And pitying view the lovesick band, And mock the winged boy's malicious hand. IX Thus frequent pass'd the cloudless day, To smiles and sweet discourse resign'd; While i exulted to survey One generous woman's real mind: Till friendship soon my languid breast Each night with unknown cares possess'd, Dash'd my coy slumbers, or my dreams distress'd. X Fool that i was—And now, even now While thus i preach the Stoic strain, Unless i shun Olympia's view, An hour unsays it all again. O friend!—when love directs her eyes To pierce where every passion lies, Where is the firm, the cautious, or the wise? ODE XII. TO SIR FRANCIS HENRY DRAKE, BARONET. I Behold; the Balance in the sky Swift on the wintry scale inclines: To earthy caves the Dryads fly, And the bare pastures Pan resigns. Late did the farmer's fork o'erspread With recent soil the twice-mown mead, Tainting the bloom which autumn knows: He whets the rusty coulter now, He binds his oxen to the plough, And wide his future harvest throws. II Now, London's busy confines round, By Kensington's imperial towers, From Highgate's rough descent profound, Essexian heaths, or Kentish bowers, Where'er i pass, i see approach Some rural statesman's eager coach Hurried by senatorial cares: While rural nymphs (alike, within, Aspiring courtly praise to win) Debate their dress, reform their airs. III Say, what can now the country boast, O Drake, thy footsteps to detain, When peevish winds and gloomy frost The sunshine of the temper stain? Say, are the priests of Devon grown Friends to this tolerating throne, Champions for George's legal right? Have general freedom, equal law, Won to the glory of Nassau Each bold Wessexian squire and knight? IV I doubt it much; and guess at least That when the day, which made us free, Shall next return, that sacred feast Thou better may'st observe with me. With me the sulphurous treason old A far inferior part shall hold In that glad day's triumphal strain; And generous William be rever'd, Nor one untimely accent heard Of James or his ignoble reign. V Then, while the Gascon's fragrant wine With modest cups our joy supplies, We'll truly thank the power divine Who bade the chief, the patriot rise; Rise from heroic ease (the spoil Due, for his youth's Herculean toil, From Belgium to her savior son) Rise with the same unconquer'd zeal For our Britannia's injur'd weal, Her laws defac'd, her shrines o'erthrown. VI He came. The tyrant from our shore, Like a forbidden demon, fled; And to eternal exile bore Pontific rage and vassal dread. There sunk the mouldering Gothic reign: New years came forth, a liberal train, Call'd by the people's great decree. That day, my friend, let blessings crown: —Fill, to the demigod's renown From whom thou hast that thou art free. VII Then, Drake, (for wherefore should we part The public and the private weal?) In vows to her who sways thy heart, Fair health, glad fortune, will we deal. Whether Aglaia's blooming cheek, Or the soft ornaments that speak So eloquent in Daphne's smile, Whether the piercing lights that fly From the dark heaven of Myrto's eye, Haply thy fancy then beguile. VIII For so it is. thy stubborn breast, Though touch'd by many a slighter wound, Hath no full conquest yet confess'd, Nor the one fatal charmer found. While i, a true and loyal swain, My fair Olympia's gentle reign Through all the varying seasons own. Her genius still my bosom warms: No other maid for me hath charms, Or i have eyes for her alone. ODE XIII. ON LYRIC POETRY. I. 1 Once more i join the Thespian choir, And taste the inspiring fount again: O parent of the Grecian lyre, Admit me to thy powerful strain— And lo, with ease my step invades The pathless vale and opening shades, Till now i spy her verdant seat; And now at large i drink the sound, While these her offspring, listening round, By turns her melody repeat. 2 I see Anacreon smile and sing, His silver tresses breathe perfume; His cheek displays a second spring Of roses taught by wine to bloom. Away, deceitful cares, away, And let me listen to his lay; Let me the wanton pomp injoy, While in smooth dance the light-wing'd Hours Lead round his lyre it's patron powers, Kind laughter and convivial joy. 3 Broke from the fetters of his native land, Devoting shame and vengeance to her lords, With louder impulse and a threatening hand The Alcæus. Lesbian patriot smites the sounding chords: Ye wretches, ye perfidious train, Ye curs'd of gods and freeborn men, Ye murderers of the laws, Though now ye glory in your lust, Though now ye tread the feeble neck in dust, Yet Time and righteous Jove will judge your dreadful cause. II. 1 But lo, to Sappho's melting airs Descends the radiant queen of love: She smiles, and asks what fonder cares Her suppliant's plaintive measures move: Why is my faithful maid distress'd? Who, Sappho, wounds thy tender breast? Say, flies he?—Soon he shall pursue: Shuns he thy gifts—He soon shall give: Slights he thy sorrows?—He shall grieve, And soon to all thy wishes bow. 2 But, o Melpomene, for whom Awakes thy golden shell again? What mortal breath shall e'er presume To echo that unbounded strain? Majestic in the frown of years, Behold, the Pindar. man of Thebes appears: For some there are, whose mighty frame The hand of Jove at birth indow'd With hopes that mock the gazing crowd; As eagles drink the noontide flame, 3 While the dim raven beats her weary wings, And clamours far below.—Propitious Muse, While i so late unlock thy purer springs, And breathe whate'er thy ancient airs infuse, Wilt thou for Albion's sons around (Ne'er had'st thou audience more renown'd) Thy charming arts imploy, As when the winds from shore to shore Through Greece thy lyre's persuasive language bore, Till towns and isles and seas return'd the vocal joy? III. 1 Yet then did pleasure's lawless throng, Oft rushing forth in loose attire, Thy virgin dance, thy graceful song Pollute with impious revels dire. O fair, o chaste, thy echoing shade May no soul discord here invade: Nor let thy strings one accent move, Except what earth's untroubled ear 'Mid all her social tribes may hear, And heaven's unerring throne approve. 2 Queen of the lyre, in thy retreat The fairest flowers of Pindus glow; The vine aspires to crown thy seat, And myrtles round thy laurel grow. Thy strings adapt their varied strain To every pleasure, every pain, Which mortal tribes were born to prove; And strait our passions rise or fall, As at the wind's imperious call The ocean swells, the billows move. 3 When midnight listens o'er the slumbering earth, Let me, o Muse, thy solemn whispers hear: When morning sends her fragrant breezes forth, With airy murmurs touch my opening ear. And ever watchful at thy side, Let wisdom's awful suffrage guide The tenor of thy lay: To her of old by Jove was given To judge the various deeds of earth and heaven; 'Twas thine by gentle arts to win us to her sway. IV. 1 Oft as, to well-earn'd ease resign'd, I quit the maze where science toils, Do thou refresh my yielding mind With all thy gay, delusive spoils. But, o indulgent, come not nigh The busy steps, the jealous eye Of wealthy care or gainful age; Whose barren souls thy joys disdain, And hold as foes to reason's reign Whome'er thy lovely works ingage. 2 When friendship and when letter'd mirth Haply partake my simple board, Then let thy blameless hand call forth The music of the Teian chord. Or if invok'd at softer hours, O! seek with me the happy bowers That hear Olympia's gentle tongue; To beauty link'd with virtue's train, To love devoid of jealous pain, There let the Sapphic lute be strung. 3 But when from envy and from death to claim A hero bleeding for his native land; When to throw incense on the vestal flame Of liberty my genius gives command, Nor Theban voice nor Lesbian lyre From thee, o Muse, do i require; While my presaging mind, Conscious of powers she never knew, Astonish'd grasps at things beyond her view, Nor by another's fate submits to be confin'd. ODE XIV. TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES TOWNSHEND: FROM THE COUNTRY. I Say, Townshend, what can London boast To pay thee for the pleasures lost, The health to-day resign'd, When spring from this her favorite seat Bade winter hasten his retreat, And met the western wind. II Oh knew'st thou how the balmy air, The sun, the azure heavens prepare To heal thy languid frame, No more would noisy courts ingage; In vain would lying faction's rage Thy sacred leisure claim. III Oft i look'd forth, and oft admir'd; Till with the studious volume tir'd I sought the open day; And, sure, i cry'd, the rural gods Expect me in their green abodes, And chide my tardy lay. IV But ah in vain my restless feet Trac'd every silent shady seat Which knew their forms of old: Nor Naiad by her fountain laid, Nor Wood-nymph tripping through her glade, Did now their rites unfold: V Whether to nurse some infant oak They turn the slowly-tinkling brook And catch the pearly showers, Or brush the mildew from the woods, Or paint with noontide beams the buds, Or breathe on opening flowers. VI Such rites, which they with spring renew, The eyes of care can never view; And care hath long been mine: And hence offended with their guest, Since grief of love my soul oppress'd, They hide their toils divine. VII But soon shall thy inlivening tongue This heart, by dear affliction wrung, With noble hope inspire: Then will the sylvan powers again Receive me in their genial train, And listen to my lyre. VIII Beneath yon Dryad's lonely shade A rustic altar shall be paid, Of turf with laurel fram'd: And thou the inscription wilt approve; “This for the peace which, lost by love, “By friendship was reclaim'd.” ODE XV. TO THE EVENING-STAR. I To-night retir'd the queen of heaven With young Endymion stays: And now to Hesper is it given Awhile to rule the vacant sky, Till she shall to her lamp supply A stream of brighter rays. II O Hesper, while the starry throng With awe thy path surrounds, Oh listen to my suppliant song, If haply now the vocal sphere Can suffer thy delighted ear To stoop to mortal sounds. III So may the bridegroom's genial strain Thee still invoke to shine: So may the bride's unmarried train To Hymen chaunt their flattering vow, Still that his lucky torch may glow With lustre pure as thine. IV Far other vows must i prefer To thy indulgent power. Alass, but now i paid my tear On fair Olympia's virgin tomb: And lo, from thence, in quest i roam Of Philomela's bower. V Propitious send thy golden ray, Thou purest light above: Let no false flame seduce to stray Where gulph or steep lie hid for harm: But lead where music's healing charm May sooth afflicted love. VI To them, by many a grateful song In happier seasons vow'd, These lawns, Olympia's haunt, belong: Oft by yon silver stream we walk'd, Or fix'd, while Philomela talk'd, Beneath yon copses stood. VII Nor seldom, where the beachen boughs That roofless tower invade, We came while her inchanting Muse The radiant moon above us held: Till by a clamorous owl compell'd She fled the solemn shade. VIII But hark; i hear her liquid tone. Now, Hesper, guide my feet Down the red marle with moss o'ergrown, Through yon wild thicket next the plain, Whose hawthorns choke the winding lane Which leads to her retreat. IX See the green space: on either hand Inlarg'd it spreads around: See, in the midst she takes her stand, Where one old oak his awful shade Extends o'er half the level mead Inclos'd in woods profound. X Hark, how through many a melting note She now prolongs her lays: How sweetly down the void they float! The breeze their magic path attends: The stars shine out: the forest bends: The wakeful heifers gaze. XI Whoe'er thou art whom chance may bring To this sequester'd spot, If then the plaintive Syren sing, Oh softly tread beneath her bower, And think of heaven's disposing power, Of man's uncertain lot. XII Oh think, o'er all this mortal stage, What mournful scenes arise: What ruin waits on kingly rage: How often virtue dwells with woe: How many griefs from knowledge flow: How swiftly pleasure flies. XIII O sacred bird, let me at eve, Thus wandering all alone, Thy tender counsel oft receive, Bear witness to thy pensive airs, And pity nature's common cares Till i forget my own. ODE XVI. TO CALEB HARDINGE, M. D. I With sordid floods the wintry Aquarius. Urn Hath stain'd fair Richmond's level green: Her naked hill the Dryads mourn, No longer a poetic scene. No longer there thy raptur'd eye The beauteous forms of earth or sky Surveys as in their Author's mind: And London shelters from the year Those whom thy social hours to share The Attic Muse design'd. II From Hampstead's airy summit me Her guest the city shall behold, What day the people's stern decree To unbelieving kings is told, When common men (the dread of fame) Adjudg'd as one of evil name, Before the sun, the anointed head. Then seek thou too the pious town, With no unworthy cares to crown That evening's awful shade. III Deem not i call thee to deplore The sacred martyr of the day, By fast and penitential lore To purge our ancient guilt away. For this, on humble faith i rest That still our advocate, the priest, From heavenly wrath will save the land; Nor ask what rites our pardon gain, Nor how his potent sounds restrain The thunderer's lifted hand. IV No, Hardinge: peace to church and state! That evening, let the Muse give law: While i anew the theme relate Which my first youth inamor'd saw. Then will i oft explore thy thought, What to reject which Locke hath taught, What to pursue in Virgil's lay: Till hope ascends to loftiest things, Nor envies demagogues or kings Their frail and vulgar sway. V O vers'd in all the human frame, Lead thou where'er my labor lies, And English fancy's eager flame To Grecian purity chastize: While hand in hand, at wisdom's shrine, Beauty with truth i strive to join, And grave assent with glad applause; To paint the story of the soul, And Plato's visions to controul By Verulam gave one of his titles to Francis Bacon, author of the Novum Organum. Verulamian laws. ODE XVII. ON A SERMON AGAINST GLORY. MDCCXLVII. I Come then, tell me, sage divine, Is it an offence to own That our bosoms e'er incline Toward immortal glory's throne? For with me nor pomp, nor pleasure, Bourbon's might, Braganza's treasure, So can fancy's dream rejoice, So conciliate reason's choice, As one approving word of her impartial voice. II If to spurn at noble praise Be the pass-port to thy heaven, Follow thou those gloomy ways; No such law to me was given, Nor, i trust, shall i deplore me Faring like my friends before me; Nor an holier place desire Than Timoleon's arms acquire, And Tully's curule chair, and Milton's golden lyre. ODE XVIII. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FRANCIS EARL OF HUNTINGDON. MDCCXLVII. I. 1. The wise and great of every clime, Through all the spacious walks of Time, Where'er the Muse her power display'd, With joy have listen'd and obey'd. For taught of heaven, the sacred Nine Persuasive numbers, forms divine, To mortal sense impart: They best the soul with glory fire; They noblest counsels, boldest deeds inspire; And high o'er Fortune's rage inthrone the fixed heart. 2. Nor less prevailing is their charm The vengeful bosom to disarm; To melt the proud with human woe, And prompt unwilling tears to flow. Can wealth a power like this afford? Can Cromwell's arts, or Marlborough's sword, An equal empire claim? No, Hastings. Thou my words wilt own: Thy breast the gifts of every Muse hath known; Nor shall the giver's love disgrace thy noble name. 3. The Muse's awful art, And the blest function of the poet's tongue, Ne'er shalt thou blush to honour; to assert From all that scorned vice or slavish fear hath sung. Nor shall the blandishment of Tuscan strings Warbling at will in pleasure's myrtle bower; Nor shall the servile notes to Celtic kings By flattering minstrels paid in evil hour, Move thee to spurn the heavenly Muse's reign. A different strain, And other themes From her prophetic shades and hallow'd streams (Thou well can'st witness) meet the purged ear: Such, as when Greece to her immortal shell Rejoicing listen'd, godlike sounds to hear; To hear the sweet instructress tell (While men and heroes throng'd around) How life its noblest use may find, How well for freedom be resign'd; And how, by glory, virtue shall be crown'd. II. 1. Such was the Chian father's strain To many a kind domestic train, Whose pious hearth and genial bowl Had chear'd the reverend pilgrim's soul: When, every hospitable rite With equal bounty to requite, He struck his magic strings; And pour'd spontaneous numbers forth, And seiz'd their ears with tales of ancient worth, And fill'd their musing hearts with vast heroic things. 2. Lycurgus the Lacedæmonian lawgiver brought into Greece from Asia Minor the first complete copy of Homer's works.—At Platæa was fought the decisive battle between the Persian army and the united militia of Greece under Pausanias and Aristides.—Cimon the Athenian erected a trophy in Cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the Persians by sea and land. Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils, after this great success; in which it is very remarkable, that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions. It is this: ??. ??. ??. ???????. ?????. ?)???. ??????. ??????. ???. ??????. ??????. ??????. ????. ??????. ?????. ??. ????????. ??????????. ??????. ??????. ?????. ??. ???????. ???. ????. ??????. ???. ????. ???. ??. ??????. ??????. ???????. ?????????. ????????. ??????. ????. ????. ??. ???????. ??????. ?????????. ????. ??. ???????. ????. ??? ?????. ????????. ??????????. ?????. ??????. ???????. The following translation is almost literal: Since first the sea from Asia's hostile coast Divided Europe, and the god of war Assail'd imperious cities; never yet, At once among the waves and on the shore, Hath such a labour been atchiev'd by men Who earth inhabit. They, whose arms the Medea In Cyprus felt pernicious, they, the same, Have won from skilful Tyre an hundred ships Crouded with warriors. Asia groans, in both Her hands sore smitten, by the might of war. Now oft, where happy spirits dwell, Where yet he tunes his charming shell, Oft near him, with applauding hands, The genius of his country stands. To listening gods he makes him known, That man divine, by whom were sown The seeds of Grecian fame: Who first the race with freedom fir'd; From whom Lycurgus Sparta's sons inspir'd; From whom Platæan palms and Cyprian trophies came. 3. Pindar was cotemporary with Aristides and Cimon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height. When Xerxes invaded Greece, Pindar was true to the common interest of his country; though his fellow citizens, the Thebans, had sold themselves to the Persian king. In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind, occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece. (Isthm. 8.) In another he celebrates the victories of Salamis, Platæa, and Himera. (Pyth. 1.) It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him. First then, he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo, that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings. It was said of him, as of some other illustrious men, that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips, and fed him with their honey. It was also a tradition concerning him, that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real historical fact in his life is, that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit, shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty, which his own fellow citizens had shamefully betrayed. And, as the argument of this ode implies, that great poetical talents, and high sentiments of liberty, do reciprocally produce and assist each other, so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connection, which occurs in history. The Thebans were remarkable, in general, for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their common-wealth; at the time of its ruin by Philip; and even in its best state, under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas: and every one knows, they were no less remarkable for great dullness, and want of all genius. That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow citizens in both these respects, seems somewhat extraordinary, and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation. O noblest, happiest age! When Aristides rul'd, and Cimon fought; When all the generous fruits of Homer's page Exulting Pindar saw to full perfection bought. O Pindar, oft shalt thou be hail'd of me: Not that Apollo fed thee from his shrine; Not that thy lips drank sweetness from the bee; Nor yet that, studious of thy notes divine, Pan danc'd their measure with the sylvan throng: But that thy song Was proud to unfold What thy base rulers trembled to behold; Amid corrupted Thebes was proud to tell The deeds of Athens and the Persian shame: Hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell. But thou, o faithful to thy fame, The Muse's law did'st rightly know; That who would animate his lays, And other minds to virtue raise, Must feel his own with all her spirit glow. III. 1. Are there, approv'd of later times, Whose verse adorn'd a Octavianus Cæsar. tyrant's crimes? Who saw majestic Rome betray'd, And lent the imperial ruffian aid? Alas! not one polluted bard, No, not the strains that Mincius heard, Or Tibur's hills reply'd, Dare to the Muse's ear aspire; Save that, instructed by the Grecian lyre, With freedom's ancient notes their shameful task they hide. 2. Mark, how the dread Pantheon stands, Amid the domes of modern hands: Amid the toys of idle state, How simply, how severely great! Then turn, and, while each western clime Presents her tuneful sons to Time, So mark thou Milton's name; And add, “Thus differs from the throng “The spirit which inform'd thy awful song, “Which bade thy potent voice protect thy country's fame.” 3. Alluding to his Defence of the people of England against Salmasius. See particularly the manner in which he himself speaks of that undertaking, in the introduction to his reply to Morus. Yet hence barbaric zeal His memory with unholy rage pursues; While from these arduous cares of public weal She bids each bard begone, and rest him with his Muse. O fool! to think the man, whose ample mind Must grasp at all that yonder stars survey; Must join the noblest forms of every kind, The world's most perfect image to display, Can e'er his country's majesty behold, Unmov'd or cold! O fool! to deem That he, whose thought must visit every theme, Whose heart must every strong emotion know Inspir'd by nature, or by fortune taught; That he, if haply some presumptuous foe, With false ignoble science fraught, Shall spurn at freedom's faithful band; That he their dear defence will shun, Or hide their glories from the sun, Or deal their vengeance with a woman's hand! IV. 1. I care not that in Arno's plain, Or on the sportive banks of Seine, From public themes the Muse's quire Content with polish'd ease retire. Where priests the studious head command, Where tyrants bow the warlike hand To vile ambition's aim, Say, what can public themes afford, Save venal honors to an hateful lord, Reserv'd for angry heaven and scorn'd of honest fame? 2. But here, where freedom's equal throne To all her valiant sons is known; Where all are conscious of her cares, And each the power, that rules him, shares; Here let the bard, whose dastard tongue Leaves public arguments unsung, Bid public praise farewell: Let him to fitter climes remove, Far from the hero's and the patriot's love, And lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell. 3. Edward the Third; from whom descended Henry Hastings, third Earl of Huntingdon, by the daughter of the Duke of Clarence, brother to Edward the Fourth. O Hastings, not to all Can ruling heaven the same endowments lend: Yet still doth nature to her offspring call, That to one general weal their different powers they bend, Unenvious. Thus alone, though strains divine Inform the bosom of the Muse's son; Though with new honors the patrician's line Advance from age to age; yet thus alone They win the suffrage of impartial fame. The poet's name He best shall prove, Whose lays the soul with noblest passions move. But thee, o progeny of heroes old, Thee to severer toils thy fate requires: The fate which form'd thee in a chosen mould, The grateful country of thy sires, Thee to sublimer paths demand; Sublimer than thy sires could trace, Or thy own Edward teach his race, Though Gaul's proud genius sank beneath his hand. V. 1. From rich domains and subject farms, They led the rustic youth to arms; And kings their stern atchievements fear'd; While private strife their banners rear'd. But loftier scenes to thee are shown, Where empire's wide-establish'd throne No private master fills: Where, long foretold, the People reigns: Where each a vassal's humble heart disdains; And judgeth what he sees; and, as he judgeth, wills. 2. Here be it thine to calm and guide The swelling democratic tide; To watch the state's uncertain frame, And baffle faction's partial aim: But chiefly, with determin'd zeal, To quell that servile band, who kneel To freedom's banish'd foes; That monster, which is daily found Expert and bold thy country's peace to wound; Yet dreads to handle arms, nor manly counsel knows. 3. At Whittington, a village on the edge of Scarsdale in Derbyshire, the Earls of Devonshire and Danby, with the Lord Delamere, privately concerted the plan of the Revolution. The house in which they met is at present a farmhouse, and the country people distinguish the room where they sat, by the name of the plotting parlour. 'Tis highest heaven's command, That guilty aims should sordid paths pursue; That what ensnares the heart should maim the hand, And virtue's worthless foes be false to glory too. But look on freedom. see, through every age, What labours, perils, griefs, hath she disdain'd! What arms, what regal pride, what priestly rage, Have her dread offspring conquer'd or sustain'd! For Albion well have conquer'd. Let the strains Of happy swains, Which now resound Where Scarsdale's cliffs the swelling pastures bound, Bear witness. there, oft let the farmer hail The sacred orchard which imbowers his gate, And shew to strangers passing down the vale, Where Candish, Booth, and Osborne sate; When bursting from their country's chain, Even in the midst of deadly harms, Of papal snares and lawless arms, They plann'd for freedom this her noblest reign. VI. 2. This reign, these laws, this public care, Which Nassau gave us all to share, Had ne'er adorn'd the English name, Could fear have silenc'd freedom's claim. But fear in vain attempts to bind Those lofty efforts of the mind Which social good inspires; Where men, for this, assault a throne, Each adds the common welfare to his own; And each unconquer'd heart the strength of all acquires. 2. Say, was it thus, when late we view'd Our fields in civil blood imbru'd? When fortune crown'd the barbarous host, And half the astonish'd isle was lost? Did one of all that vaunting train, Who dare affront a peaceful reign, Durst one in arms appear? Durst one in counsels pledge his life? Stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife? Or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to chear? 3. Yet, Hastings, these are they Who challenge to themselves thy country's love; The true; the constant: who alone can weigh, What glory should demand, or liberty approve! But let their works declare them. Thy free powers, The generous powers of thy prevailing mind, Not for the tasks of their confederate hours, Lewd brawls and lurking slander, were design'd. Be thou thy own approver. Honest praise Oft nobly sways Ingenuous youth: But, sought from cowards and the lying mouth, Praise is reproach. Eternal God alone For mortals fixeth that sublime award. He, from the faithful records of his throne, Bids the historian and the bard Dispose of honor and of scorn; Discern the patriot from the slave; And write the good, the wise, the brave, For lessons to the multitude unborn. THE END OF BOOK THE FIRST. ODES, BOOK THE SECOND. ODE I. THE REMONSTRANCE OF SHAKESPEARE: Supposed to have been spoken at the Theatre Royal, while the French Comedians were acting by Subscription. MDCCXLIX. If, yet regardful of your native land, Old Shakespeare's tongue you deign to understand, Lo, from the blissful bowers where heaven rewards Instructive sages and unblemish'd bards, I come, the ancient founder of the stage, Intent to learn, in this discerning age, What form of wit your fancies have imbrac'd, And whither tends your elegance of taste, That thus at length our homely toils you spurn, That thus to foreign scenes you proudly turn, That from my brow the laurel wreath you claim To crown the rivals of your country's fame. What, though the footsteps of my devious Muse The measur'd walks of Grecian art refuse? Or though the frankness of my hardy style Mock the nice touches of the critic's file? Yet, what my age and climate held to view, Impartial i survey'd and fearless drew. And say, ye skillful in the human heart, Who know to prize a poet's noblest part, What age, what clime, could e'er an ampler field For lofty thought, for daring fancy, yield? I saw this England break the shameful bands Forg'd for the souls of men by sacred hands: I saw each groaning realm her aid implore; Her sons the heroes of each warlike shore; Her naval standard (the dire Spaniard's bane) Obey'd through all the circuit of the main. Then too great commerce, for a late-found world, Around your coast her eager sails unfurl'd: New hopes, new passions, thence the bosom fir'd; New plans, new arts, the genius thence inspir'd; Thence every scene, which private fortune knows, In stronger life, with bolder spirit, rose. Disgrac'd i this full prospect which i drew? My colours languid, or my strokes untrue? Have not your sages, warriors, swains, and kings, Confess'd the living draught of men and things? What other bard in any clime appears Alike the master of your smiles and tears? Yet have i deign'd your audience to intice With wretched bribes to luxury and vice? Or have my various scenes a purpose known Which freedom, virtue, glory, might not own? Such from the first was my dramatic plan; It should be your's to crown what i began: And now that England spurns her Gothic chain, And equal laws and social science reign, I thought, Now surely shall my zealous eyes View nobler bards and juster critics rise, Intent with learned labour to refine The copious ore of Albion's native mine, Our stately Muse more graceful airs to teach, And form her tongue to more attractive speech, Till rival nations listen at her feet, And own her polish'd as they own'd her great. But do you thus my favorite hopes fullfil? Is France at last the standard of your skill? Alas for you! that so betray a mind Of art unconscious and to beauty blind. Say; does her language your ambition raise, Her barren, trivial, unharmonious phrase, Which fetters eloquence to scantiest bounds, And maims the cadence of poetic sounds? Say; does your humble admiration chuse The gentle prattle of her Comic Muse, While wits, plain-dealers, fops, and fools appear, Charg'd to say nought but what the king may hear? Or rather melt your sympathizing hearts Won by her tragic scene's romantic arts, Where old and young declaim on soft desire, And heroes never, but for love, expire? No. Though the charms of novelty, awhile, Perhaps too fondly win your thoughtless smile, Yet not for you design'd indulgent fate The modes or manners of the Bourbon state. And ill your minds my partial judgment reads, And many an augury my hope misleads, If the fair maids of yonder blooming train To their light courtship would an audience deign, Or those chaste matrons a Parisian wife Chuse for the model of domestic life; Or if one youth of all that generous band, The strength and splendor of their native land, Would yield his portion of his country's fame, And quit old freedom's patrimonial claim, With lying smiles oppression's pomp to see, And judge of glory by a king's decree. O blest at home with justly-envied laws, O long the chiefs of Europe's general cause, Whom heaven hath chosen at each dangerous hour To check the inroads of barbaric power, The rights of trampled nations to reclaim, And guard the social world from bonds and shame; Oh let not luxury's fantastic charms Thus give the lye to your heroic arms: Nor for the ornaments of life imbrace Dishonest lessons from that vaunting race, Whom fate's dread laws (for, in eternal fate Despotic rule was heir to freedom's hate) Whom in each warlike, each commercial part, In civil counsel, and in pleasing art, The judge of earth predestin'd for your foes, And made it fame and virtue to oppose. ODE II. TO SLEEP. I Thou silent power, whose welcome sway Charms every anxious thought away; In whose divine oblivion drown'd, Sore pain and weary toil grow mild, Love is with kinder looks beguil'd, And grief forgets her fondly-cherish'd wound; Oh whither hast thou flown, indulgent god? God of kind shadows and of healing dews, Whom dost thou touch with thy Lethæan rod? Around whose temples now thy opiate airs diffuse? II Lo, midnight from her starry reign Looks awful down on earth and main. The tuneful birds lie hush'd in sleep, With all that crop the verdant food, With all that skim the crystal flood, Or haunt the caverns of the rocky steep. No rushing winds disturb the tufted bowers; No wakeful sound the moon-light valley knows, Save where the brook its liquid murmur pours, And lulls the waving scene to more profound repose. III Oh let not me alone complain, Alone invoke thy power in vain! Descend, propitious, on my eyes; Not from the couch that bears a crown, Not from the courtly statesman's down, Nor where the miser and his treasure lies: Bring not the shapes that break the murderer's rest, Nor those the hireling soldier loves to see, Nor those which haunt the bigot's gloomy breast: Far be their guilty nights, and far their dreams from me! IV Nor yet those awful forms present, For chiefs and heroes only meant: The figur'd brass, the choral song, The rescued people's glad applause, The listening senate, and the laws Fix'd by the counsels of After Timoleon had delivered Syracuse from the tyranny of Dionysius, the people on every important deliberation sent for him into the public assembly, asked his advice, and voted according to it. Plutarch. Timoleon's tongue, Are scenes too grand for fortune's private ways; And though they shine in youth's ingenuous view, The sober gainful arts of modern days To such romantic thoughts have bid a long adieu. V I ask not, god of dreams, thy care To banish Love's presentments fair: Nor rosy cheek nor radiant eye Can arm him with such strong command That the young sorcerer's fatal hand Should round my soul his pleasing fetters tie. Nor yet the courtier's hope, the giving smile (A lighter phantom, and a baser chain) Did e'er in slumber my proud lyre beguile To lend the pomp of thrones her ill-according strain. VI But, Morpheus, on thy balmy wing Such honorable visions bring, As sooth'd great Milton's injur'd age, When in prophetic dreams he saw The race unborn with pious awe Imbibe each virtue from his heavenly page: Or such as Mead's benignant fancy knows When health's deep treasures, by his art explor'd, Have sav'd the infant from an orphan's woes, Or to the trembling sire his age's hope restor'd. ODE III. TO THE CUCKOW. I O rustic herald of the spring, At length in yonder woody vale Fast by the brook i hear thee sing; And, studious of thy homely tale, Amid the vespers of the grove, Amid the chaunting choir of love, Thy sage responses hail. II The time has been when i have frown'd To hear thy voice the woods invade; And while thy solemn accent drown'd Some sweeter poet of the shade, Thus, thought i, thus the sons of care Some constant youth or generous fair With dull advice upbraid. III I said, “While Philomela's song “Proclaims the passion of the grove, “It ill beseems a cuckow's tongue “Her charming language to reprove”— Alas, how much a lover's ear Hates all the sober truth to hear, The sober truth of love! IV When hearts are in each other bless'd, When nought but lofty faith can rule The nymph's and swain's consenting breast, How cuckow-like in Cupid's school, With store of grave prudential saws On fortune's power and custom's laws, Appears each friendly fool! V Yet think betimes, ye gentle train Whom love and hope and fancy sway, Who every harsher care disdain, Who by the morning judge the day, Think that, in April's fairest hours, To warbling shades and painted flowers The cuckow joins his lay. ODE IV. TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES TOWNSHEND IN THE COUNTRY. MDCCL. I. 1 How oft shall i survey This humble roof, the lawn, the greenwood shade, The vale with sheaves o'erspread, The glassy brook, the flocks which round thee stray? When will thy cheerful mind Of these have utter'd all her dear esteem? Or, tell me, dost thou deem No more to join in glory's toilsome race, But here content imbrace That happy leisure which thou had'st resign'd? 2 Alas, ye happy hours, When books and youthful sport the soul could share, Ere one ambitious care Of civil life had aw'd her simpler powers; Oft as your winged train Revisit here my friend in white array, Oh fail not to display Each fairer scene where i perchance had part, That so his generous heart The abode of even friendship may remain. 3 For not imprudent of my loss to come, I saw from contemplation's quiet cell His feet ascending to another home Where public praise and envied greatness dwell. But shall we therefore, o my lyre Reprove ambition's best desire? Extinguish glory's flame? Far other was the task injoin'd When to my hand thy strings were first assign'd: Far other faith belongs to friendship's honor'd name. II. 1 Thee, Townshend, not the arms Of slumbering ease, nor pleasure's rosy chain, Were destin'd to detain: No, nor bright science, nor the Muse's charms. For them high heaven prepares Their proper votaries, an humbler band: And ne'er would Spenser's hand Have deign'd to strike the warbling Tuscan shell, Nor Harrington to tell What habit an immortal city wears, 2 Had this been born to shield The cause which Cromwell's impious hand betray'd, Or that, like Vere, display'd His redcross banner o'er the Belgian field. Yet where the will divine Hath shut those loftiest paths, it next remains, With reason clad in strains Of harmony, selected minds to inspire, And virtue's living fire To feed and eternize in hearts like thine. 3 For never shall the herd, whom envy sways, So quell my purpose or my tongue controul, That i should fear illustrious worth to praise, Because it's master's friendship mov'd my soul. Yet, if this undissembling strain Should now perhaps thine ear detain With any pleasing sound, Remember thou that righteous fame From hoary age a strict account will claim Of each auspicious palm with which thy youth was crown'd. III. 1 Nor obvious is the way Where heaven expects thee, nor the traveller leads, Through flowers or fragrant meads, Or groves that hark to Philomela's lay. The impartial laws of fate To nobler virtues wed severer cares. Is there a man who shares The summit next where heavenly natures dwell? Ask him (for he can tell) What storms beat round that rough laborious height. 2 Ye heroes, who of old Did generous England freedom's throne ordain; From Alfred's parent reign To Nassau, great deliverer, wise and bold; I know your perils hard, Your wounds, your painful marches, wintry seas, The night estrang'd from ease, The day by cowardice and falsehood vex'd, The head with doubt perplex'd, The indignant heart disdaining the reward 3 Which envy hardly grants. But, o renown, O praise from judging heaven and virtuous men, If thus they purchas'd thy divinest crown, Say, who shall hesitate? or who complain? And now they sit on thrones above: And when among the gods they move Before the sovran mind, “Lo, these,” he saith, “lo, these are they “Who to the laws of mine eternal sway “From violence and fear asserted human kind.” IV. 1 Thus honor'd while the train Of legislators in his presence dwell; If i may aught foretell, The statesman shall the second palm obtain. For dreadful deeds of arms Let vulgar bards, with undiscerning praise, More glittering trophies raise: But wisest heaven what deeds may chiefly move To favor and to love? What, save wide blessings, or averted harms? 2 Nor to the imbattled field Shall these achievements of the peaceful gown The green immortal crown Of valor, or the songs of conquest, yield. Not Fairfax wildly bold, While bare of crest he hew'd his fatal way, Through Nasesby's firm array, To heavier dangers did his breast oppose Than Pym's free virtue chose, When the proud force of Strafford he controul'd. 3 But what is man at enmity with truth? What were the fruits of Wentworth's copious mind When (blighted all the promise of his youth) The patriot in a tyrant's league had join'd? Let Ireland's loud-lamenting plains, Let Tyne's and Humber's trampled swain Let menac'd London tell How impious guile made wisdom base; How generous zeal to cruel rage gave place; And how unbless'd he liv'd and how dishonor'd fell. V. 1 Thence never hath the Muse Around his tomb Pierian roses flung: Nor shall one poet's tongue His name for music's pleasing labor chuse. And sure, when nature kind Hath deck'd some favor'd breast above the throng, That man with grievous wrong Affronts and wounds his genius, if he bends To guilt's ignoble ends The functions of his ill-submitting mind. 2 For worthy of the wise Nothing can seem but virtue; nor earth yield Their fame an equal field, Save where impartial freedom gives the prize. There Somers fix'd his name, Inroll'd the next to William. there shall Time To every wondering clime Point out that Somers, who from faction's croud, The slanderous and the loud, Could fair assent and modest reverence claim. 3 Nor aught did laws or social arts acquire, Nor this majestic weal of Albion's land Did aught accomplish, or to aught aspire, Without his guidance, his superior hand. And rightly shall the Muse's care Wreaths like her own for him prepare, Whose mind's inamor'd aim Could forms of civil beauty draw Sublime as ever sage or poet saw, Yet still to life's rude scene the proud ideas tame. VI. 1 Let none profane be near! The Muse was never foreign to his breast: On power's grave seat confess'd, Still to her voice he bent a lover's ear. And if the blessed know Their ancient cares, even now the unfading groves, Where haply Milton roves With Spenser, hear the inchanted echos round Through farthest heaven resound Wise Somers, guardian of their fame below. 2 He knew, the patriot knew, That letters and the Muses powerful art Exalt the ingenuous heart, And brighten every form of just and true. They lend a nobler sway To civil wisdom, than corruption's lure Could ever yet procure: They too from envy's pale malignant light Conduct her forth to sight Cloath'd in the fairest colors of the day. 3 O Townshend, thus may Time, the judge severe, Instruct my happy tongue of thee to tell: And when i speak of one to freedom dear For planning wisely and for acting well, Of one whom glory loves to own, Who still by liberal means alone Hath liberal ends pursu'd; Then, for the guerdon of my lay, “This man with faithful friendship,” will i say, “From youth to honor'd age my arts and me hath view'd.” ODE V. ON LOVE OF PRAISE. I Of all the springs within the mind Which prompt her steps in fortune's maze, From none more pleasing aid we find Than from the genuine love of praise. II Nor any partial, private end Such reverence to the public bears; Nor any passion, virtue's friend, So like to virtue's self appears. III For who in glory can delight Without delight in glorious deeds? What man a charming voice can slight, Who courts the echo that succeeds? IV But not the echo on the voice More, than on virtue praise, depends; To which, of course, it's real price The judgment of the praiser lends. V If praise then with religious awe From the sole perfect judge be sought, A nobler aim, a purer law Nor priest, nor bard, nor sage hath taught. VI With which in character the same Tho' in an humbler sphere it lies, I count that soul of human fame, The suffrage of the good and wise. ODE VI. TO WILLIAM HALL, ESQUIRE: WITH THE WORKS OF CHAULIEU. I Attend to Chaulieu's wanton lyre; While, fluent as the sky-lark sings When first the morn allures it's wings, The epicure his theme pursues: And tell me if, among the choir Whose music charms the banks of Seine, So full, so free, so rich a strain E'er dictated the warbling Muse. II Yet, Hall, while thy judicious ear Admires the well-dissembled art That can such harmony impart To the lame pace of Gallic rhymes; While wit from affectation clear, Bright images, and passions true, Recall to thy assenting view The envied bards of nobler times; III Say, is not oft his doctrine wrong? This priest of pleasure, who aspires To lead us to her sacred fires, Knows he the ritual of her shrine? Say (her sweet influence to thy song So may the goddess still afford) Doth she consent to be ador'd With shameless love and frantic wine? IV Nor Cato, nor Chrysippus here Need we in high indignant phrase From their Elysian quiet raise; But pleasure's oracle alone Consult; attentive, not severe. O pleasure, we blaspheme not thee; Nor emulate the rigid knee Which bends but at the Stoic throne. V We own had fate to man assign'd Nor sense, nor wish but what obey Or Venus soft or Bacchus gay, Then might our bard's voluptuous creed Most aptly govern human kind: Unless perchance what he hath sung Of tortur'd joints and nerves unstrung, Some wrangling heretic should plead. VI But now with all these proud desires For dauntless truth and and honest fame; With that strong master of our frame, The inexorable judge within, What can be done? Alas, ye fires Of love; alas, ye rosy smiles, Ye nectar'd cups from happier soils, —Ye have no bribe his grace to win. ODE VII. TO THE RIGHT REVEREND BENJAMIN LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER. MDCCLIV. I. 1. For toils which patriots have endur'd, For treason quell'd and laws secur'd, In every nation Time displays The palm of honourable praise. Envy may rail; and faction fierce May strive: but what, alas, can those (Though bold, yet blind and sordid foes) To gratitude and love oppose, To faithful story and persuasive verse? 2. O nurse of freedom, Albion, say, Thou tamer of despotic sway, What man, among thy sons around, Thus heir to glory hast thou found? What page, in all thy annals bright, Hast thou with purer joy survey'd Than that where truth, by Hoadly's aid, Shines through imposture's solemn shade, Through kingly and through sacerdotal night? 3. To him the Teacher bless'd, Who sent religion, from the palmy field By Jordan, like the morn to cheer the west, And lifted up the veil which heaven from earth conceal'd, To Hoadly thus his mandate he address'd: “Go thou, and rescue my dishonor'd law “From hands rapacious and from tongues impure: “Let not my peaceful name be made a lure “Fell persecution's mortal snares to aid: “Let not my words be impious chains to draw “The freeborn soul in more than brutal awe, “To faith without assent, allegiance unrepaid.” II. 1. Mr. Locke died in 1704, when Mr. Hoadly was beginning to distinguish himself in the cause of civil and religious liberty: Lord Godolphin in 1712, when the doctrines of the Jacobite faction were chiefly favoured by those in power: Lord Somers in 1716, amid the practices of the nonjuring clergy against the protestant establishment; and Lord Stanhope in 1721, during the controversy with the lower house of convocation. No cold or unperforming hand Was arm'd by heaven with this command. The world soon felt it: and, on high, To William's ear with welcome joy Did Locke among the blest unfold The rising hope of Hoadly's name, Godolphin then confirm'd the fame; And Somers, when from earth he came, And generous Stanhope the fair sequel told. 2. Then drew the lawgivers around, (Sires of the Grecian name renown'd) And listening ask'd, and wondering knew, What private force could thus subdue The vulgar and the great combin'd; Could war with sacred folly wage; Could a whole nation disengage From the dread bonds of many an age, And to new habits mould the public mind. 3. For not a conqueror's sword, Nor the strong powers to civil founders known, Were his: but truth by faithful search explor'd, And social sense, like seed, in genial plenty sown. Wherever it took root, the soul (restor'd To freedom) freedom too for others sought. Not monkish craft the tyrant's claim divine, Not regal zeal the bigot's cruel shrine Could longer guard from reason's warfare sage; Not the wild rabble to sedition wrought, Nor synods by the papal Genius taught, Nor St. John's spirit loose, nor Atterbury's rage. III. 1. But where shall recompence be found? Or how such arduous merit crown'd? For look on life's laborious scene: What rugged spaces lie between Adventurous virtue's early toils And her triumphal throne! The shade Of death, mean time, does oft invade Her progress; nor, to us display'd, Wears the bright heroine her expected spoils. 2. Yet born to conquer is her power: —O Hoadly, if that favourite hour On earth arrive, with thankful awe We own just heaven's indulgent law, And proudly thy success behold; We attend thy reverend length of days With benediction and with praise, And hail Thee in our public ways Like some great spirit fam'd in ages old. 3. While thus our vows prolong Thy steps on earth, and when by us resign'd Thou join'st thy seniors, that heroic throng Who rescu'd or preserv'd the rights of human kind, O! not unworthy may thy Albion's tongue Thee still, her friend and benefactor, name: O! never, Hoadly, in thy country's eyes, May impious gold, or pleasure's gaudy prize, Make public virtue, public freedom, vile; Nor our own manners tempt us to disclaim That heritage, our noblest wealth and fame, Which Thou hast kept intire from force and factious guile. ODE VIII. [If rightly tuneful bards decide] I If rightly tuneful bards decide, If it be fix'd in love's decrees, That beauty ought not to be tried But by its native power to please, Then tell me, youths and lovers, tell, What fair can Amoret excell? II Behold that bright unsullied smile, And wisdom speaking in her mien: Yet (she so artless all the while, So little studious to be seen) We nought but instant gladness know, Nor think to whom the gift we owe. III But neither music, nor the powers Of youth and mirth and frolick cheer, Add half that sunshine to the hours, Or make life's prospect half so clear, As memory brings it to the eye From scenes where Amoret was by. IV Yet not a satirist could there Or fault or indiscretion find; Nor any prouder sage declare One virtue, pictur'd in his mind, Whose form with lovelier colours glows Than Amoret's demeanor shows. V This sure is beauty's happiest part: This gives the most unbounded sway: This shall inchant the subject heart When rose and lily fade away; And she be still, in spite of time, Sweet Amoret in all her prime. ODE IX. AT STUDY. I Whither did my fancy stray? By what magic drawn away Have I left my studious theme? From this philosophic page, From the problems of the sage, Wandering thro' a pleasing dream? II 'Tis in vain alas! i find, Much in vain, my zealous mind Would to learned wisdom's throne Dedicate each thoughtful hour: Nature bids a softer power Claim some minutes for his own. III Let the busy or the wise View him with contemptuous eyes; Love is native to the heart: Guide its wishes as you will; Without Love you'll find it still Void in one essential part. IV Me though no peculiar fair Touches with a lover's care; Though the pride of my desire Asks immortal friendship's name, Asks the palm of honest fame, And the old heroic lyre; IV Though the day have smoothly gone, Or to letter'd leisure known, Or in social duty spent; Yet at eve my lonely breast Seeks in vain for perfect rest; Languishes for true content. ODE X. TO THOMAS EDWARDS, ESQUIRE: ON THE LATE EDITION OF MR. POPE'S WORKS. MDCCLI. I Believe me, Edwards, to restrain The licence of a railer's tongue Is what but seldom men obtain By sense or wit, by prose or song: A task for more Herculean powers, Nor suited to the sacred hours Of leisure in the Muse's bowers. II In bowers where laurel weds with palm, The Muse, the blameless queen, resides: Fair fame attends, and wisdom calm Her eloquence harmonious guides: While, shut for ever from her gate, Oft trying, still repining, wait Fierce envy and calumnious hate. III Who then from her delightful bounds Would step one moment forth to heed What impotent and savage sounds From their unhappy mouths proceed? No: rather Spenser's lyre again Prepare, and let thy pious strain For Pope's dishonor'd shade complain. IV Tell how displeas'd was every bard, When lately in the Elysian grove They of his Muse's guardian heard, His delegate to fame above; And what with one accord they said Of wit in drooping age misled, And Warburton's officious aid: V During Mr. Pope's war with Theobald, Concanen, and the rest of their tribe, Mr. Warburton, the present Lord Bishop of Gloucester, did with great zeal cultivate their friendship; having been introduced, forsooth, at the meetings of that respectable confederacy: a favour which he afterwards spoke of in very high terms of complacency and thankfulness. At the same time in his intercourse with them he treated Mr. Pope in a most contemptuous manner, and as a writer without genius. Of the truth of these assertions his Lordship can have no doubt, if he recollects his own correspondence with Concanen; a part of which is still in being, and will probably be remembered as long as any of this prelate's writings. How Virgil mourn'd the sordid fate To that melodious lyre assign'd Beneath a tutor who so late With Midas and his rout combin'd By spiteful clamor to confound That very lyre's enchanting sound, Though listening realms admir'd around: VI How Horace own'd he thought the fire Of his friend Pope's satiric line Did farther fuel scarce require From such a militant divine: How Milton scorn'd the sophist vain Who durst approach his hallow'd strain With unwash'd hands and lips profane. VII Then Shakespear debonnair and mild Brought that strange comment forth to view; Conceits more deep, he said and smil'd, Than his own fools or madmen knew: But thank'd a generous friend above, Who did with free adventurous love Such pageants from his tomb remove. VIII And if to Pope, in equal need, The same kind office thou would'st pay, Then, Edwards, all the band decreed That future bards with frequent lay Should call on thy auspicious name, From each absurd intruder's claim To keep inviolate their fame. ODE XI. TO THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN OF ENGLAND. MDCCLVIII. I Whither is Europe's ancient spirit fled? Where are those valiant tenants of her shore, Who from the warrior bow the strong dart sped, Or with firm hand the rapid pole-ax bore? Freeman and soldier was their common name. Who late with reapers to the furrow came, Now in the front of battle charg'd the foe: Who taught the steer the wintry plough to indure, Now in full councils check'd incroaching power, And gave the guardian laws their majesty to know. II But who are ye? from Ebro's loitering sons To Tiber's pageants, to the sports of Seine; From Rhine's frail palaces to Danube's thrones And cities looking on the Cimbric main, Ye lost, ye self-deserted? whose proud lords Have baffled your tame hands, and given your swords To slavish ruffians, hir'd for their command: These, at some greedy monk's or harlot's nod, See rifled nations crouch beneath their rod: These are the public will, the reason of the land. III Thou, heedless Albion, what, alas, the while Dost thou presume? O inexpert in arms, Yet vain of freedom, how dost thou beguile, With dreams of hope, these near and loud alarms? Thy splendid home, thy plan of laws renown'd, The praise and envy of the nations round, What care hast thou to guard from fortune's sway? Amid the storms of war, how soon may all The lofty pile from its foundations fall, Of ages the proud toil, the ruin of a day! IV No: thou art rich, thy streams and fertile vales Add industry's wise gifts to nature's store: And every port is crouded with thy sails, And every wave throws treasure on thy shore. What boots it? If luxurious plenty charm Thy selfish heart from glory, if thy arm Shrink at the frowns of danger and of pain, Those gifts, that treasure is no longer thine. Oh rather far be poor. Thy gold will shine Tempting the eye of force, and deck thee to thy bane. V But what hath force or war to do with thee? Girt by the azure tide and thron'd sublime Amid thy floating bulwarks, thou canst see, With scorn, the fury of each hostile clime Dash'd ere it reach thee. Sacred from the foe Are thy fair fields. athwart thy guardian prow No bold invader's foot shall tempt the strand— Yet say, my country, will the waves and wind Obey thee? Hast thou all thy hopes resign'd To the sky's fickle faith? the pilot's wavering hand? VI For oh may neither fear nor stronger love (Love, by thy virtuous princes nobly won) Thee, last of many wretched nations, move, With mighty armies station'd round the throne To trust thy safety. Then, farewell the claims Of freedom! Her proud records to the flames Then bear, an offering at ambition's shrine; Whate'er thy ancient patriots dar'd demand From furious John's, or faithless Charles's hand, Or what great William seal'd for his adopted line. VII But if thy sons be worthy of their name, If liberal laws with liberal hearts they prize, Let them from conquest, and from servile shame In war's glad school their own protectors rise. Ye chiefly, heirs of Albion's cultur'd plains, Ye leaders of her bold and faithful swains, Now not unequal to your birth be found: The public voice bids arm your rural state, Paternal hamlets for your ensigns wait, And grange and fold prepare to pour their youth around. VIII Why are ye tardy? what inglorious care Detains you from their head, your native post? Who most their country's fame and fortune share, 'Tis theirs to share her toils, her perils most. Each man his task in social life sustains. With partial labours, with domestic gains Let others dwell: to you indulgent heaven By counsel and by arms the public cause To serve for public love and love's applause, The first imployment far, the noblest hire, hath given. IX Have ye not heard of Lacedæmon's fame? Of Attic chiefs in freedom's war divine? Of Rome's dread generals? the Valerian name? The Fabian sons? the Scipios, matchless line? Your lot was theirs. the farmer and the swain Met his lov'd patron's summons from the plain; The legions gather'd; the bright eagles flew: Barbarian monarchs in the triumph mourn'd; The conquerors to their houshold gods return'd, And fed Calabrian flocks, and steer'd the Sabine plough. X Shall then this glory of the antique age, This pride of men, be lost among mankind? Shall war's heroic arts no more ingage The unbought hand, the unsubjected mind? Doth valour to the race no more belong? No more with scorn of violence and wrong Doth forming nature now her sons inspire, That, like some mystery to few reveal'd, The skill of arms abash'd and aw'd they yield, And from their own defence with hopeless hearts retire? XI O shame to human life, to human laws! The loose adventurer, hireling of a day, Who his fell sword without affection draws, Whose God, whose country, is a tyrant's pay, This man the lessons of the field can learn; Can every palm, which decks a warrior, earn, And every pledge of conquest: while in vain, To guard your altars, your paternal lands, Are social arms held out to your free hands: Too arduous is the lore; too irksome were the pain. XII Meantime by pleasure's lying tales allur'd, From the bright sun and living breeze ye stray; And deep in London's gloomy haunts immur'd, Brood o'er your fortune's, freedom's, health's decay. O blind of choice and to yourselves untrue! The young grove shoots, their bloom the fields renew, The mansion asks its lord, the swains their friend; While he doth riot's orgies haply share, Or tempt the gamester's dark, destroying snare, Or at some courtly shrine with slavish incense bend. XIII And yet full oft your anxious tongues complain That lawless tumult prompts the rustic throng; That the rude village-inmates now disdain Those homely ties which rul'd their fathers long. Alas, your fathers did by other arts Draw those kind ties around their simple hearts, And led in other paths their ductile will; By succour, faithful counsel, courteous cheer, Won them the ancient manners to revere, To prize their country's peace and heaven's due rites fulfill. XIV But mark rhe judgement of experienc'd Time, Tutor of nations. Doth light discord tear A state? and impotent sedition's crime? The powers of warlike prudence dwell not there; The powers who to command and to obey, Instruct the valiant. There would civil sway The rising race to manly concord tame? Oft let the marshal'd field their steps unite, And in glad splendor bring before their sight One common cause and one hereditary fame. XV Nor yet be aw'd, nor yet your task disown, Though war's proud votaries look on severe; Though secrets, taught erewhile to them alone, They deem profan'd by your intruding ear. Let them in vain, your martial hope to quell, Of new refinements, fiercer weapons tell, And mock the old simplicity, in vain: To the time's warfare, simple or refin'd, The time itself adapts the warrior's mind; And equal prowess still shall equal palms obtain. XVI Say then; if England's youth, in earlier days, On glory's field with well-train'd armies vy'd, Why shall they now renounce that generous praise? Why dread the foreign mercenary's pride? Though Valois brav'd young Edward's gentle hand, And Albret rush'd on Henry's way-worn band, With Europe's chosen sons in arms renown'd, Yet not on Vere's bold archers long they look'd, Nor Audley's squires nor Mowbray's yeomen brook'd: They saw their standard fall, and left their monarch bound. XVII Such were the laurels which your fathers won; Such glory's dictates in their dauntless breast: —Is there no voice that speaks to every son? No nobler, holier call to You address'd? O! by majestic freedom, righteous laws, By heavenly truth's, by manly reason's cause, Awake; attend; be indolent no more: By friendship, social peace, domestic love, Rise; arm; your country's living safety prove; And train her valiant youth, and watch around her shore. ODE XII. ON RECOVERING FROM A FIT OF SICKNESS, IN THE COUNTRY. MDCCLVIII. I Thy verdant scenes, O Goulder's hill, Once more i seek, a languid guest: With throbbing temples and with burden'd breast Once more i climb thy steep aerial way. O faithful cure of oft-returning ill, Now call thy sprightly breezes round, Dissolve this rigid cough profound, And bid the springs of life with gentler movement play. II How gladly 'mid the dews of dawn My weary lungs thy healing gale, The balmy west or the fresh north, inhale! How gladly, while my musing footsteps rove Round the cool orchard or the sunny lawn, Awak'd i stop, and look to find What shrub perfumes the pleasant wind, Or what wild songster charms the Dryads of the grove. III Now, ere the morning walk is done, The distant voice of health i hear Welcome as beauty's to the lover's ear. “Droop not, nor doubt of my return,” she cries; “Here will i, 'mid the radiant calm of noon, “Meet thee beneath yon chesnut bower, “And lenient on thy bosom pour “That indolence divine which lulls the earth and skies.” IV The goddess promis'd not in vain. I found her at my favorite time. Nor wish'd to breathe in any softer clime, While (half-reclin'd, half-slumbering as i lay) She hover'd o'er me. Then, among her train Of nymphs and zephyrs, to my view Thy gracious form appear'd anew, Then first, o heavenly Muse, unseen for many a day. V In that soft pomp the tuneful maid Shone like the golden star of love. I saw her hand in careless measures move; I heard sweet preludes dancing on her lyre, While my whole frame the sacred sound obey'd. New sunshine o'er my fancy springs, New colours clothe external things, And the last glooms of pain and sickly plaint retire. VI O Goulder's hill, by thee restor'd Once more to this inliven'd hand, My harp, which late resounded o'er the land The voice of glory, solemn and severe, My Dorian harp shall now with mild accord To thee her joyful tribute pay, And send a less-ambitious lay Of friendship and of love to greet thy master's ear. VII For when within thy shady seat First from the sultry town he chose, And the tir'd senate's cares, his wish'd repose, Then wast thou mine; to me a happier home For social leisure: where my welcome feet, Estrang'd from all the intangling ways In which the restless vulgar strays, Through nature's simple paths with ancient faith might roam. VIII And while around his sylvan scene My Dyson led the white-wing'd hours, Oft from the Athenian Academic bowers Their sages came: oft heard our lingering walk The Mantuan music warbling o'er the green: And oft did Tully's reverend shade, Though much for liberty afraid, With us of letter'd ease or virtuous glory talk. IX But other guests were on their way, And reach'd erelong this favor'd grove; Even the celestial progeny of Jove, Bright Venus, with her all-subduing son, Whose golden shaft most willingly obey The best and wisest. As they came, Glad Hymen wav'd his genial flame, And sang their happy gifts, and prais'd their spotless throne. X I saw when through yon festive gate He led along his chosen maid, And to my friend with smiles presenting said; “Receive that fairest wealth which heaven assign'd “To human fortune. Did thy lonely state “One wish, one utmost hope confess? “Behold, she comes, to adorn and bless: “Comes, worthy of thy heart, and equal to thy mind.” ODE XIII. TO THE AUTHOR OF MEMOIRS OF THE HOUSE OF BRANDENBURGH: MDCCLI. In the year 1751 appeared a very splendid edition, in quarto, of Memoires pour servir à l' Histoire de la Maison de Brandebourg, à Berlin &amp; à la Haye; with a privilege signed Federic; the same being engraved in imitation of hand-writing. In this edition, among other extraordinary passages, are the two following, to which the third stanza of this ode more particularly refers: I The men renown'd as chiefs of human race, And born to lead in counsels or in arms, Have seldom turn'd their feet from glory's chace To dwell with books or court the Muse's charms. Yet, to our eyes if haply time hath brought Some genuine transcript of their calmer thought, There still we own the wise, the great, or good; And Cæsar there and Xenophon are seen, As clear in spirit and sublime of mien, As on Pharsalian plains, or by the Assyrian flood. II Say thou too, Frederic, was not this thy aim? Thy vigils could the student's lamp ingage, Except for this? except that future fame Might read thy genius in the faithful page? That if hereafter envy shall presume With words irreverent to inscribe thy tomb, And baser weeds upon thy palms to fling, That hence posterity may try thy reign, Assert thy treaties, and thy wars explain, And view in native lights the hero and the king. III O evil foresight and pernicious care! Wilt thou indeed abide by this appeal? Shall we the lessons of thy pen compare With private honor or with public zeal? Whence then at things divine those darts of scorn? Why are the woes, which virtuous men have borne For sacred truth, a prey to laughter given? What fiend, what foe of nature urg'd thy arm The Almighty of his scepter to disarm? To push this earth adrift and leave it loose from heaven? IV Ye godlike shades of legislators old, Ye who made Rome victorious, Athens wise, Ye first of mortals with the bless'd inroll'd, Say did not horror in your bosoms rise, When thus by impious vanity impell'd A magistrate, a monarch, ye beheld Affronting civil order's holiest bands? Those bands which ye so labor'd to improve? Those hopes and fears of justice from above, Which tam'd the savage world to your divine commands? ODE XIV. THE COMPLAINT. I Away! Away! Tempt me no more, insidious love: Thy soothing sway Long did my youthful bosom prove: At length thy treason is discern'd, At length some dear-bought caution earn'd: Away! nor hope my riper age to move. II I know, i see Her merit. Needs it now be shewn, Alas, to me? How often, to myself unknown, The graceful, gentle, virtuous maid Have i admir'd! How often said, What joy to call a heart like her's one's own! III But, flattering god, O squanderer of content and ease, In thy abode Will care's rude lesson learn to please? O say, deceiver, hast thou won, Proud fortune to attend thy throne, Or plac'd thy friends above her stern decrees? ODE XV. ON DOMESTIC MANNERS. [UNFINISHED.] I Meek honor, female shame, O! whither, sweetest offspring of the sky, From Albion dost thou fly; Of Albion's daughters once the favorite fame? O beauty's only friend, Who giv'st her pleasing reverence to inspire; Who selfish, bold desire Dost to esteem and dear affection turn; Alas, of thee forlorn What joy, what praise, what hope can life pretend? II Behold; our youths in vain Concerning nuptial happiness inquire: Our maids no more aspire The arts of bashful Hymen to attain; But with triumphant eyes And cheeks impassive, as they move along, Ask homage of the throng. The lover swears that in a harlot's arms Are found the self-same charms, And worthless and deserted lives and dies. III Behold; unbless'd at home, The father of the cheerless household mourns: The night in vain returns, For love and glad content at distance roam; While she, in whom his mind Seeks refuge from the day's dull task of cares, To meet him she prepares, Through noise and spleen and all the gamester's art, A listless, harrass'd heart, Where not one tender thought can welcome find. IV 'Twas thus, along the shore Of Thames, Britannia's guardian Genius heard, From many a tongue preferr'd, Of strife and grief the fond invective lore: At which the queen divine Indignant, with her adamantine spear Like thunder sounding near, Smote the red cross upon her silver shield, And thus her wrath reveal'd. (I watch'd her awful words and made them mine.) THE END OF BOOK THE SECOND. HYMN TO THE NAIADS. ARGUMENT. The Nymphs, who preside over springs and rivulets, are addressed at day-break, in honor of their several functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of the gods and the rise of things. They are then successively considered, as giving motion to the air and exciting summer-breezes; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable creation; as contributing to the fullness of navigable rivers, and consequently to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means, to the maritime part of military power. Next is represented their favourable influence upon health, when assisted by rural exercise: which introduces their connection with the art of physic, and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs. Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them, and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive: in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets. O'er yonder eastern hill the twilight pale Walks forth from darkness; and the God of day, With bright Astræa seated by his side, Waits yet to leave the ocean. Tarry, Nymphs, Ye Nymphs, ye blue-ey'd progeny of Thames, Who now the mazes of this rugged heath Trace with your fleeting steps; who all night long Repeat, amid the cool and tranquil air, Your lonely murmurs, tarry: and receive My offer'd lay. To pay you homage due, I leave the gates of sleep; nor shall my lyre Too far into the splendid hours of morn Ingage your audience: my observant hand Shall close the strain ere any sultry beam Approach you. To your subterranean haunts Ye then may timely steal; to pace with care The humid sands; to loosen from the soil The bubbling sources; to direct the rills To meet in wider channels; or beneath Some grotto's dripping arch, at height of noon To slumber, shelter'd from the burning heaven. Where shall my song begin, ye Nymphs? or end? Wide is your praise and copious—First of things, First of the lonely powers, ere Time arose, Hesiod, in his Theogony, gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldest of beings; though he assigns to Love neither father nor superior; which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phædrus, in Plato's Banquet, as being observable not only in Hesiod, but in all other writers both of verse and prose: and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is expressly stiled the eldest of all the gods. Yet Aristophanes, in The Birds, affirms, that “Chaos, and Night, and Erebus, and Tartarus, were “first; and that Love was produced from an egg, which the sable-winged night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus.” But it must be observed, that the Love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other, from that original and self-existent being the ?? ?? or ?????? of Plato, and meant only the ?????????? or second person of the old Græcian trinity; to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the first-begotten, is said to have been born of an egg, and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature. In the fragments of Orpheus, collected by Henry Stephens, he is named Phanes, the discoverer or discloser; who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence, and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world; as Macrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus which they have preserved. But the Love designed in our text, is the one self-existent and infinite mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances; yet, to a modern poet, it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular; though, in other respects, he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions. For, in these great points of natural theology, they differ no less remarkably among themselves; and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history: upon which very account, Callimachus, in his hymn to Jupiter, declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed; adding, that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautic poem, ascribed to Orpheus, it is said, that “Love, whom mortals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eternally-begotten Night;” who is generally represented by these mythological poets, as being herself the parent of all things; and who, in the Indigitamenta, or Orphic Hymns, is said to be the same with Cypris, or Love itself. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautic poem, where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron, he celebrateth “the obscure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined; the generation of the earth; the depth of the ocean; and also the sapient Love, the most ancient, the self-sufficient; with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another.” Which noble passage is more directly to Aristotle's purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted, to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the other more sober philosophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For, though neither this poem, nor the hymns which pass under the same name, are, it should seem, the work of the real Orpheus; yet beyond all question, they are very ancient. The hymns, more particularly, are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes; and were probably a sett of public and solemn forms of devotion: as appears by a passage in one of them, which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton, as the saying of Orpheus, the founder of their most holy mysteries. On this account, they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant, the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble; and the mysterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impression upon the mind, cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German editor Eschenbach, when he accidentally met with them at Leipsic: “Thesaurum me reperisse credidi, says he, &amp; profecto thesaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore asslaverint indigitamenta ista deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore, &amp; in adeundis, quibus scatet urbs illa, viris doctis; sola nox restabat, quam Orpheo consecrare potui. In abyssum quendam mysteriorum venerandæ antiquitatis descendere videbar, quotiescunque silente mundo, solis vigilantibus astris et luna, ???????????? istos hymnos ad manus sumsi.”Were Love and Chaos The unformed, undigested mass of Moses and Plato: which Milton calls “The womb of nature.”. Love, the sire of Fate Fate is the universal system of natural causes; the work of the Omnipotent Mind, or of Love: so Minucius Felix: “Quid enim aliud est fatum, quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est.” So also Cicero, in The First Book on Divination: “Fatum autem id appello, quod Græci ???????????; id est, ordinem seriemque causarum, cum causa causæ nexa rem ex se gignat—ex quo intelligitur, ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose, sed id quod physice dicitur causa æterna rerum.” To the same purpose is the doctrine of Hierocles, in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny. As to the three Fates, or Destinies of the poets, they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relates to man, and to other mortal beings: for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphic Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love), and, contrary to the vulgar notion, are distinguished by the epithets of gentle, and tender-hearted. According to Hesiod, Theog. ver. 904, they were the daughters of Jupiter and Themis: but in the Orphic Hymn to Venus, or Love, that Goddess is directly stiled the mother of Necessity, and is represented, immediately after, as governing the three Destinies, and conducting the whole system of natural causes.; Elder than Chaos. Born of Fate was Time Cronos, Saturn, or Time, was, according to Apollodorus, the son of Cælum and Tellus. But the author of the hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language, and calls him plainly the offspring of the earth and the starry heaven; that is, of Fate, as explained in the preceding note., The known fable of Saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies; which are produced and destroyed by Time.Who many sons and many comely births Jupiter, so called by Pindar.Devour'd, relentless father: 'till the child Of Rhea drove him from the upper sky That Jupiter dethroned his father Saturn, is recorded by all the mythologists. Phurnutus, or Cornutus, the author of a little Greek treatise on the nature of the gods, informs us, that by Jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world, which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which Saturn, or Time, used formerly to cause in the mundane system., And quell'd his deadly might. Then social reign'd Our mythology here supposeth, that before the establishment of the vital, vegetative, plastic nature (represented by Jupiter), the four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition; but afterwards, well-disposed and at peace among themselves. Tethys was the wife of the Ocean; Ops, or Rhea, the Earth; Vesta, the eldest daughter of Saturn, Fire; and the cloud-compeller, or ???? ?????????????, the Air: though he also represented the plastic principle of nature, as may be seen in the Orphic hymn inscribed to him. The kindred powers, Tethys, and reverend Ops, And spotless Vesta; while supreme of sway Remain'd the cloud-compeller. From the couch Of Tethys sprang the sedgy-crowned race The river-gods; who, according to Hesiod's Theogony, were the sons of Oceanus and Tethys., Who from a thousand urns, o'er every clime, Send tribute to their parent; and from them Are ye, o Naiads The descent of the Naiads is less certain than most points of the Greek mythology. Homer, Odyss. xiii. ?????? ????. Virgil, in The Eighth Book of the Æneid, speaks as if the Nymphs, or Naiads, were the parents of the rivers: but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod, and evidently departs from the orthodox system, which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river. On the other hand, Callimachus, who was very learned in all the school-divinity of those times, in his hymn to Delos, maketh Peneus, the great Thessalian river-god, the father of his nymphs: and Ovid, in The Fourteenth Book of his Metamorphoses, mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river-gods. Accordingly, the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally, both by Ovid and Statius, called by a patronymic, from the name of the river to which they belong.: Arethusa fair, And tuneful Aganippe; that sweet name, Bandusia; that soft family which dwelt With Syrian Daphne The grove of Daphne in Syria, near Antioch, was famous for its delightful fountains.; and the honour'd tribes Belov'd of Pæon Mineral and medicinal springs. Pæon was the physician of the gods.. Listen to my strain, Daughters of Tethys: listen to your praise. You, Nymphs, the winged offspring The Winds; who, according to Hesiod and Apollodorus, were the sons of Astræus and Aurora., which of old Aurora to divine Astræus bore, Owns; and your aid beseecheth. When the might Of Hyperíon A son of Cælum and Tellus, and father of the Sun, who is thence called, by Pindar, Hyperionides. But Hyperíon is put by Homer in the same manner as here, for the Sun himself., from his noontide throne, Unbends their languid pinions, aid from you They ask: Favonius and the mild South-west From you relief implore. Your sallying streams The state of the atmosphere with respect to rest and motion is, in several ways, affected by rivers and running streams; and that more especially in hot seasons: first, they destroy its equilibrium, by cooling those parts of it with which they are in contact; and secondly, they communicate their own motion: and the air which is thus moved by them, being left heated, is of consequence more elastic than other parts of the atmosphere, and therefore fitter to preserve and to propagate that motion. Fresh vigour to their weary wings impart. Again they fly, disporting; from the mead Half ripen'd and the tender blades of corn, To sweep the noxious mildew; or dispel Contagious steams, which oft the parched earth Breathes on her fainting sons. From noon to eve, Along the river and the paved brook, Ascend the cheerful breezes: hail'd of bards Who, fast by learned Cam, the Æolian lyre Sollicit; nor unwelcome to the youth Who on the heights of Tibur, all inclin'd O'er rushing Anio, with a pious hand The reverend scene delineates, broken fanes, Or tombs, or pillar'd aqueducts, the pomp Of ancient Time; and haply, while he scans The ruins, with a silent tear revolves The fame and fortune of imperious Rome. You too, o Nymphs, and your unenvious aid The rural powers confess; and still prepare For you their choicest treasures. Pan commands, Oft as the Delian king One of the epithets of Apollo, or the Sun, in the Orphic hymn inscribed to him. with Sirius holds The central heavens, the father of the grove Commands his Dryads over your abodes To spread their deepest umbrage. well the god Remembereth how indulgent ye supplied Your genial dews to nurse them in their prime. Pales, the pasture's queen, where'er ye stray, Pursues your steps, delighted; and the path With living verdure clothes. Around your haunts The laughing Chloris The ancient Greek name for Flora., with profusest hand, Throws wide her blooms, her odors. Still with you Pomona seeks to dwell: and o'er the lawns, And o'er the vale of Richmond, where with Thames Ye love to wander, Amalthea The mother of the first Bacchus, whose birth and education was written, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, in the old Pelasgic character, by Thymœtes, grandson to Laomedon, and contemporary with Orpheus. Thymœtes had travelled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean; there he saw the island of Nysa, and learned from the inhabitants, that “Ammon, king of Libya, was married in former ages to Rhea, sister of Saturn and the Titans: that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was Amalthea; had by her a son, and gave her possession of a neighbouring tract of land, wonderfully fertile; which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox, was thence called the Hesperian horn, and afterwards the horn of Amalthea: that fearing the jealousy of Rhea, he concealed the young Bacchus, with his mother, in the island of Nysa;” the beauty of which, Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style. This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology, and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton; the only modern poet (unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser) who, in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story, had a heart to feel, and words to express, the simple and solitary genius of antiquity. To raise the idea of his Paradise, he prefers it even to ? “that Nysean isle Girt by the river Triton, where old Cham, (Whom Gentiles Ammon call, and Libyan Jove) Hid Amalthea, and her florid son, Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye.” pours Well-pleas'd the wealth of that Ammonian horn, Her dower; unmindful of the fragrant isles Nysæan or Atlantic. Nor can'st thou, (Albeit oft, ungrateful, thou dost mock The beverage of the sober Naiad's urn, O Bromius, o Lenæan) nor can'st thou Disown the powers whose bounty, ill repaid, With nectar feeds thy tendrils. Yet from me, Yet, blameless Nymphs, from my delighted lyre, Accept the rites your bounty well may claim; Nor heed the scoffings of the Edonian band The priestesses and other ministers of Bacchus; so called from Edonus, a mountain of Thrace, where his rites were celebrated.. For better praise awaits you. Thames, your sire, As down the verdant slope your duteous rills Descend, the tribute stately Thames receives, Delighted; and your piety applauds; And bids his copious tide roll on secure, For faithful are his daughters; and with words Auspicious gratulates the bark which, now His banks forsaking, her adventurous wings Yields to the breeze, with Albion's happy gifts Extremest isles to bless. And oft at morn, When Hermes Hermes, or Mercury, was the patron of commerce; in which benevolent character he is addressed by the author of the Indigitamenta, in these beautiful lines: ??????? ??????, ??????????, ???????????, ?? ????????? ????? ??????? ????? ???????., from Olympus bent o'er earth To bear the words of Jove, on yonder hill Stoops lightly-sailing; oft intent your springs He views: and waving o'er some new-born stream His blest pacific wand, “And yet,” he cries, “Yet,” cries the son of Maia, “though recluse “And silent be your stores, from you, fair Nymphs, “Flows wealth and kind society to men. “By you my function and my honor'd name “Do i possess; while o'er the Bœtic vale, “Or through the towers of Memphis, or the palms “By sacred Ganges water'd, i conduct “The English merchant: with the buxom fleece “Of fertile Ariconium while i clothe “Sarmatian kings; or to the household gods “Of Syria, from the bleak Cornubian shore, The merchants of Sidon and Tyre made frequent voyages to the coast of Cornwall, from whence they carried home great quantities of tin.“Dispense the mineral treasure which of old “Sidonian pilots sought, when this fair land “Was yet unconscious of those generous arts “Which wise Phœnicia from their native clime “Transplanted to a more indulgent heaven.” Such are the words of Hermes: such the praise, O Naiads, which from tongues cœlestial waits Your bounteous deeds. From bounty issueth power: And those who, sedulous in prudent works, Relieve the wants of nature, Jove repays With noble wealth, and his own seat on earth, Fit judgements to pronounce, and curb the might Of wicked men. Your kind unfailing urns Not vainly to the hospitable arts Of Hermes yield their store. For, o ye Nymphs, Mercury, the patron of commerce, being so greatly dependent on the good offices of the Naiads, in return obtains for them the friendship of Minerva, the goddess of war: for military power, at least the naval part of it, hath constantly followed the establishment of trade; which exemplifies the preceding observation, that “from bounty issueth power.”Hath he not won the unconquerable queen Of arms to court your friendship? You she owns The fair associates who extend her sway Wide o'er the mighty deep; and grateful things Of you she uttereth, oft as from the shore Of Thames, or Medway's vale, or the green banks Of Vecta, she her thundering navy leads To Calpe's foaming channel, or the rough Cantabrian surge Gibraltar and The Bay of Biscay.; her auspices divine Imparting to the senate and the prince Of Albion, to dismay barbaric kings, The Iberian, or the Celt. The pride of kings Was ever scorn'd by Pallas: and of old Rejoic'd the virgin, from the brazen prow Of Athens o'er Ægina's gloomy surge Near this island, the Athenians obtained the victory of Salamis, over the Persian navy., To drive her clouds and storms; o'erwhelming all The Persian's promis'd glory, when the realms Of Indus and the soft Ionian clime, When Libya's torrid champain and the rocks Of cold Imaüs join'd their servile bands, To sweep the sons of liberty from earth. In vain: Minerva on the bounding prow Of Athens stood, and with the thunder's voice Denounc'd her terrors on their impious heads, And shook her burning ægis. Xerxes saw This circumstance is recorded in that passage, perhaps the most splendid among all the remains of ancient history, where Plutarch, in his Life of Themistocles, describes the sea-fights of Artemisium and Salamis.: From Heracléum, on the mountain's height Thron'd in his golden car, he knew the sign Cœlestial; felt unrighteous hope forsake His faultering heart, and turn'd his face with shame. Hail, ye who share the stern Minerva's power; Who arm the hand of liberty for war: And give to the renown'd Britannic name To awe contending monarchs: yet benign, Yet mild of nature: to the works of peace More prone, and lenient of the many ills Which wait on human life. Your gentle aid Hygeia well can witness; she who saves, From poisonous cates and cups of pleasing bane, The wretch devoted to the intangling snares Of Bacchus and of Comus. Him she leads To Cynthia's lonely haunts. To spread the toils, To beat the coverts, with the jovial horn At dawn of day to summon the loud hounds, She calls the lingering sluggard from his dreams: And where his breast may drink the mountain breeze, And where the fervor of the sunny vale May beat upon his brow, through devious paths Beckons his rapid courser. Nor when ease, Cool ease and welcome slumbers have becalm'd His eager bosom, does the queen of health Her pleasing care withhold. His decent board She guards, presiding; and the frugal powers With joy sedate leads in: and while the brown Ennæan dame with Pan presents her stores; While changing still, and comely in the change, Vertumnus and the Hours before him spread The garden's banquet; you to crown his feast, To crown his feast, o Naiads, you the fair Hygeia calls: and from your shelving seats, And groves of poplar, plenteous cups ye bring, To slake his veins: 'till soon a purer tide Flows down those loaded channels; washeth off The dregs of luxury, the lurking seeds Of crude disease; and through the abodes of life Sends vigour, sends repose. Hail, Naiads: hail, Who give, to labour, health; to stooping age, The joys which youth had squander'd. Oft your urns Will i invoke; and frequent in your praise, Abash the frantic Thyrsus A staff, or spear, wreathed round with ivy: of constant use in the bacchanalian mysteries. with my song. For not estrang'd from your benignant arts Is he, the god, to whose mysterious shrine My youth was sacred, and my votive cares Belong; the learned Pæon. Oft when all His cordial treasures he hath search'd in vain; When herbs, and potent trees, and drops of balm Rich with the genial influence of the sun, (To rouse dark fancy from her plantive dreams, To brace the nerveless arm, with food to win Sick appetite, or hush the unquiet breast Which pines with silent passion) he in vain Hath prov'd; to your deep mansions he descends. Your gates of humid rock, your dim arcades, He entereth; where impurpled veins of ore Gleam on the roof; where through the rigid mine Your trickling rills insinuate. There the god From your indulgent hands the streaming bowl Wafts to his pale-ey'd suppliants; wafts the seeds Metallic and the elemental salts Wash'd from the pregnant glebe. They drink: and soon Flies pain; flies inauspicious care: and soon The social haunt or unfrequented shade Hears Io, Io Pæan An exclamation of victory and triumph, derived from Apollo's encounter with Python.; as of old, When Python fell. And, o propitious Nymphs, Oft as for hapless mortals i implore Your salutary springs, through every urn Oh shed your healing treasures. With the first And finest breath, which from the genial strife Of mineral fermentation springs, like light O'er the fresh morning's vapours, lustrate then The fountain, and inform the rising wave. My lyre shall pay your bounty. Scorn not ye That humble tribute. Though a mortal hand Excite the strings to utterance, yet for themes Not unregarded of cœlestial powers, I frame their language; and the Muses deign To guide the pious tenor of my lay. The Muses (sacred be their gifts divine) In early days did to my wondering sense Their secrets oft reveal: oft my rais'd ear In slumber felt their music: oft at noon Or hour of sunset, by some lonely stream, In field or shady grove, they taught me words Of power from death and envy to preserve The good man's name. whence yet with grateful mind, And offerings unprofan'd by ruder eye, My vows i send, my homage, to the seats Of rocky Cirrha One of the summits of Parnassus, and sacred to Apollo. Near it were several fountains, said to be frequented by the Muses. Nysa, the other eminence of the same mountain, was dedicated to Bacchus., where with you they dwell: Where you their chaste companions they admit Through all the hallow'd scene: where oft intent, And leaning o'er Castalia's mossy verge, They mark the cadence of your confluent urns, How tuneful, yielding gratefullest repose To their consorted measure: 'till again, With emulation all the sounding choir, And bright Apollo, leader of the song, Their voices through the liquid air exalt, And sweep their lofty strings: those powerful strings That charm the mind of gods This whole passage, concerning the effects of sacred music among the gods, is taken from Pindar's first Pythian ode.: that fill the courts Of wide Olympus with oblivion sweet Of evils, with immortal rest from cares; Assuage the terrors of the throne of Jove; And quench the formidable thunderbolt Of unrelenting fire. With slacken'd wings, While now the solemn concert breathes around, Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lord Sleeps the stern eagle; by the number'd notes, Possess'd; and satiate with the melting tone: Sovereign of birds. The furious god of war, His darts forgetting, and the winged wheels That bear him vengeful o'er the embattled plain, Relents, and sooths his own fierce heart to ease, Most welcome ease. The sire of gods and men, In that great moment of divine delight, Looks down on all that live; and whatsoe'er He loves not, o'er the peopled earth and o'er The interminated ocean, he beholds Curs'd with abhorrence by his doom severe, And troubled at the sound. Ye, Naiads, ye With ravish'd ears the melody attend Worthy of sacred silence. But the slaves Of Bacchus with tempestuous clamours strive To drown the heavenly strains; of highest Jove, Irreverent; and by mad presumption fir'd Their own discordant raptures to advance With hostile emulation. Down they rush From Nysa's vine-impurpled cliff, the dames Of Thrace, the Satyrs, and the unruly Fauns, With old Silenus, reeling through the crowd Which gambols round him, in convulsions wild Tossing their limbs, and brandishing in air The ivy-mantled thyrsus, or the torch Through black smoke flaming, to the Phrygian pipe's The Phrygian music was fantastic and turbulent, and fit to excite disorderly passions. Shrill voice, and to the clashing cymbals, mix'd With shrieks and frantic uproar. May the gods From every unpolluted ear avert Their orgies! If within the seats of men, It was the office of Minerva to be the guardian of walled cities; whence she was named ?????? &amp; ?????????, and had her statues placed in their gates, being supposed to keep the keys; and on that account stiled ?????????.Within the walls, the gates, where Pallas holds The guardian key, if haply there be found Who loves to mingle with the revel-band And hearken to their accents; who aspires From such instructers to inform his breast With verse; let him, fit votarist, implore Their inspiration. He perchance the gifts Of young Lyæus, and the dread exploits, Pentheus was torn in pieces by the bacchanalian priests and women, for despising their mysteries.May sing in aptest numbers: he the fate Of sober Pentheus, he the Paphian rites, And naked Mars with Cytherea chain'd, And strong Alcides in the spinster's robes, May celebrate, applauded. But with you, O Naiads, far from that unhallow'd rout, Must dwell the man whoe'er to praised themes Invokes the immortal Muse. the immortal Muse Of this cave Pausanias, in his Tenth Book, gives the following description: “Between Delphi and the eminences of Parnassus, is a road to the grotto of Corycium, which has its name from the nymph Corycia, and is by far the most remarkable which I have seen. One may walk a great way into it without a torch. 'Tis of a considerable height, and hath several springs within it; and yet a much greater quantity of water distills from the shell and roof, so as to be continually dropping on the ground. The people round Parnassus hold it sacred to the Corycian nymphs and to Pan.”To your calm habitations, to the cave Corycian or the Delphic mount Delphi, the seat and oracle of Apollo, had a mountainous and rocky situation, on the skirts of Parnassus., will guide His footsteps; and with your unsullied streams His lips will bathe: whether the eternal lore Of Themis, or the majesty of Jove, To mortals he reveal; or teach his lyre The unenvied guerdon of the patriot's toils, In those unfading islands of the bless'd, Where sacred bards abide. Hail, honor'd Nymphs; Thrice hail. for You the Cyrenaïc shell Cyrene was the native country of Callimachus, whose hymns are the most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is assumed in the preceding poem, and have always afforded particular pleasure to the author of it, by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind. On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner; solely by way of exercise: the manner itself being now almost intirely abandoned in poetry. And as the meer genealogy, or the personal adventures of heathen gods, could have been but little interesting to a modern reader; it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of nature, and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed; to wit, in personifying natural causes, and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world: which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry. Behold, i touch, revering. To my songs Be present ye with favorable feet, And all profaner audience far remove. INSCRIPTIONS. I. FOR A GROTTO. To me, whom in their lays the shepherds call Actæa, daughter of the neighbouring stream, This cave belongs. The fig-tree and the vine, Which o'er the rocky entrance downward shoot, Were plac'd by Glycon. He with cowslips pale, Primrose, and purple lychnis, deck'd the green Before my threshold, and my shelving walls With honeysuckle cover'd. Here at noon, Lull'd by the murmur of my rising fount, I slumber: here my clustering fruits i tend; Or from the humid flowers, at break of day, Fresh garlands weave, and chace from all my bounds Each thing impure or noxious. Enter-in, O stranger, undismay'd. nor bat, nor toad Here lurks: and if thy breast of blameless thoughts Approve thee, not unwelcome shalt thou tread My quiet mansion: chiefly, if thy name Wise Pallas and the immortal muses own. II. FOR A STATUE OF CHAUCER AT WOODSTOCK. Such was old Chaucer. such the placid mien Of him who first with harmony inform'd The language of our fathers. Here he dwelt For many a cheerful day. these ancient walls Have often heard him, while his legends blithe He sang; of love, or knighthood, or the wiles Of homely life: through each estate and age, The fashions and the follies of the world With cunning hand portraying. Though perchance From Blenheim's towers, o stranger, thou art come Glowing with Churchill's trophies; yet in vain Dost thou applaud them, if thy breast be cold To him, this other hero; who, in times Dark and untaught, began with charming verse To tame the rudeness of his native land. III. [Whoe'er thou art whose path in summer lies] Whoe'er thou art whose path in summer lies Through yonder village, turn thee where the grove Of branching oaks a rural palace old Imbosoms. there dwells Albert, generous lord Of all the harvest round. and onward thence A low plain chapel fronts the morning light Fast by a silent riv'let. Humbly walk, O stranger, o'er the consecrated ground; And on that verdant hilloc, which thou see'st Beset with osiers, let thy pious hand Sprinkle fresh water from the brook and strew Sweet-smelling flowers. for there doth Edmund rest, The learned shepherd; for each rural art Fam'd, and for songs harmonious, and the woes Of ill-requited love. The faithless pride Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave In manhood's prime. But soon did righteous heaven With tears, with sharp remorse, and pining care, Avenge her falshood. nor could all the gold And nuptial pomp, which lur'd her plighted faith From Edmund to a loftier husband's home, Relieve her breaking heart, or turn aside The strokes of death. Go, traveller; relate The mournful story. haply some fair maid May hold it in remembrance, and be taught That riches cannot pay for truth or love. IV. [O youths and virgins: o declining eld] O youths and virgins: o declining eld: O pale misfortune's slaves: o ye who dwell Unknown with humble quiet; ye who wait In courts, or fill the golden seat of kings: O sons of sport and pleasure: o thou wretch That weep'st for jealous love, or the sore wounds Of conscious guilt, or death's rapacious hand Which left thee void of hope: o ye who roam In exile; ye who through the embattled field Seek bright renown; or who for nobler palms Contend, the leaders of a public cause; Approach: behold this marble. Know ye not The features? Hath not oft his faithful tongue Told you the fashion of your own estate, The secrets of your bosom? Here then, round His monument with reverence while ye stand, Say to each other: “This was Shakespear's form; “Who walk'd in every path of human life, “Felt every passion; and to all mankind “Doth now, will ever, that experience yield “Which his own genius only could acquire.” VI. FOR A COLUMN AT RUNNYMEDE. Thou, who the verdant plain dost traverse here, While Thames among his willows from thy view Retires; o stranger, stay thee, and the scene Around contemplate well. This is the place Where England's ancient barons, clad in arms And stern with conquest, from their tyrant king (Then render'd tame) did challenge and secure The charter of thy freedom. Pass not on Till thou hast bless'd their memory, and paid Those thanks which God appointed the reward Of public virtue. and if chance thy home Salute thee with a father's honour'd name, Go, call thy sons: instruct them what a debt They owe their ancestors; and make them swear To pay it, by transmitting down intire Those sacred rights to which themselves were born. VII. THE WOOD NYMPH. Approach in silence. 'tis no vulgar tale Which i, the Dryad of this hoary oak, Pronounce to mortal ears. The second age Now hasteneth to its period, since i rose On this fair lawn. The groves of yonder vale Are, all, my offspring: and each Nymph, who guards The copses and the furrow'd fields beyond, Obeys me. Many changes have i seen In human things, and many awful deeds Of justice, when the ruling hand of Jove Against the tyrants of the land, against The unhallow'd sons of luxury and guile, Was arm'd for retribution. Thus at length Expert in laws divine, i know the paths Of wisdom, and erroneous folly's end Have oft presag'd: and now well-pleas'd i wait Each evening till a noble youth, who loves My shade, awhile releas'd from public cares, Yon peaceful gate shall enter, and sit down Beneath my branches. Then his musing mind I prompt, unseen; and place before his view Sincerest forms of good; and move his heart With the dread bounties of the sire supreme Of gods and men, with freedom's generous deeds, The lofty voice of glory and the faith Of sacred friendship. Stranger, i have told My function. If within thy bosom dwell Aught which may challenge praise, thou wilt not leave Unhonor'd my abode, nor shall i hear A sparing benediction from thy tongue. VIII. [Ye powers unseen, to whom, the bards of Greece] Ye powers unseen, to whom, the bards of Greece Erected altars; ye who to the mind More lofty views unfold, and prompt the heart With more divine emotions; if erewhile Not quite unpleasing have my votive rites Of you been deem'd when oft this lonely seat To you i consecrated; then vouchsafe Here with your instant energy to crown My happy solitude. It is the hour When most i love to invoke you, and have felt Most frequent your glad ministry divine. The air is calm: the sun's unveiled orb Shines in the middle heaven. the harvest round Stands quiet, and among the golden sheaves The reapers lie reclin'd. the neighbouring groves Are mute; nor even a linnet's random strain Echoeth amid the silence. Let me feel Your influence, ye kind powers. Aloft in heaven, Abide ye? or on those transparent clouds Pass, ye from hill to hill? or on the shades Which yonder elms cast o'er the lake below Do you converse retir'd? From what lov'd haunt Shall i expect you? Let me once more feel Your influence, o ye kind inspiring powers: And i will guard it well, nor shall a thought Rise in my mind, nor shall a passion move Across my bosom unobserv'd, unstor'd By faithful memory. and then at some More active moment, will i call them forth Anew; and join them in majestic forms, And give them utterance in harmonious strains; That all mankind shall wonder at your sway. IX. [Me tho' in life's sequester'd vale] Me tho' in life's sequester'd vale The Almighty sire ordain'd to dwell, Remote from glory's toilsome ways, And the great scenes of public praise; Yet let me still with grateful pride Remember how my infant frame He temper'd with prophetic flame, And early music to my tongue supply'd. 'Twas then my future fate he weigh'd, And, This be thy concern, he said, At once with Passion's keen alarms, And Beauty's pleasurable charms, And sacred Truth's eternal light, To move the various mind of Man; Till under one unblemish'd plan, His Reason, Fancy, and his Heart unite. THE END.</field>
