      <field name="fulltext">MIDNIGHT THOUGHTS. NightâNight and Silence and deep Shadows round, And the great Universe without a bound! For 'tis at night we feel its grandeur most, And in its veiled Immensity are lost. Those distant worlds, that gleam in night's abyss, Call us, with voices full of powerâfrom this! Oh! of yon Palace-domeâye lamps divineâ Ye full blown flowers which in yon garden shine. That fairest Edenâleft unto our loveâ That open Paradise spread out above. Ye fairest flowers of everlasting bloom, How pine weâ'mid the shadows of the tomb, For your immortal freshnessâye are arrayed Like the field's liliesâbut ah! not to fade! Your very sight can lift us o'er our fate; Within our deepest souls ye perpetrate Strange deeds of Strength, of Mystery and of Might. Aye! in our deepest thoughts, ye worlds of Light! And with a glorious trouble, do ye shake Our inmost spiritsâtill they pine and ache, E'en to your far-off realms divine to soar, And learn all secrets of your starry lore! For most when Night makes Heaven and Earth her own, And sits sublime upon her shadowy throneâ The thirst of knowledge seizes on the soul, Which spurns the bondage of this earth's controul. O! worlds of beautyâworlds of might and powerâ We feel there yet shall come that glorious hour When our freed spirits shall in strength arise, To pierce the Eternal Mysteries of the Skies. They shall know moreâknow allâbut here in vain They chafe, and fret, and struggle 'gainst the chain! They shall know moreâknow allâbut now they failâ Themselves are weak, and their best aids are frail. All feelings deepen, and grow more intense Beneath Night's strong and wondrous influence. Then memory makes the veiled and buried past More Present than the Presentâwhich seems cast Into that gulph obliviousâwhere, before The old days were hidâthe old days that are no more: And Hopeâthe fair, the lovely Hope, too, springs Unto the noblest strength of her glad wings In that sweet solemn seasonâand makes bright The aspect of the still and shadowy Night. Oh! fairy Hopes! how ofttimes have ye fraught With joy and beauty my delighted thought In midnight's quiet hours?âand oft, how oft, Unto my dreams did ye divinely waft E'en then, a thousand rapturesâtill the day Seemed dark and cold when ye were borne away. How did yeâsmiling hopes!âshine brightly down Upon my soul, with glory all your ownâ Like glittering stars, on sparkling heaving seasâ Just ruffled by some newly risen breeze, Till each bright star seems multipliedâand made As a whole heaven of stars!âthereon displayedâ So the rich trouble of my restless thought, When once your smiling radiance it had caught, Lent but more lustre to your living beams, Till every hope redoubled in my dreams Shone gladly forthâas restless and as bright! Trembling with splendourâand with heavenly light. NightâSilenceâand deep dreamy shadows roundâ And the great Universe without a bound! Yes! when I upward lift my sleepless eyeâ That world of many worldsâthe Eternal sky, Greets me with all its boundless majesty. Ye stars! ye well may draw our deep looks there; Awful and wondrous are yeâas ye're fair! The Incomprehensibilities of Heaven Appear Embodied in yeâfor unriven The veil that shrouds ye. Oh! unriven that veil That screens your mysteries. Who shall tell your tale? Though mighty Science hath indeed done muchâ Yet there are hidden things she may not touchâ Yet there are hidden truths she may not scan, In Heaven's unutterably glorious plan! NightâSilenceâShadowsâStars, and trembling tearsâ For I must weep to think of by-past years! And all that hath past with themâraptures fledâ And hopes destroyedâand friends and feelings dead! And ah! the tears that now rain from mine eyes, Are unlike those which Hope so quickly dries. In the earliest days of her enchanted reign, When she can charm away all grief and painâ Those tears were like the bright and glistening showers Which fall to earth in summer's softest hoursâ And seem at once to turn to radiant flowers! But theseâthat heavily and harshly flowâ These tell a sterner tale of gloomy woeâ A sombre and a melancholy tale, And more resemble the icy glittering hailâ Which beats down the opening promise of the year, So darkly falls each deep and bitter tear! The moon is forthâand, like a sorceress bright, She turns to enchantment all the dreamy night! Thou fairâfair moonâthe light thou shedd'st around, Holy and solemn, brings a peace profound Unto the long disturbedâdistracted thought To which so oft vain torturing cares are brought; And softly dost thou temper and controul The wild tempestuous workings of the soul. 'Tis swayed, e'en as the seaâthe haughty seaâ Whose lightest sounds seem cries of âVictoryââ Is swayed by thy most delicate influence, And made to serve thee with a zeal intense. 'Tis bound in a most bright and lovely chain, Like that great oceanâo'er which Thou dost reignâ The strength and grandeur of the unbounded main! The powers of the old majestic tidesâfor they Still bend before thy calm triumphant sway! Thou art their life and soulâsupreme art thou, And thy supremacy they still avow. Even thus canst thou, with heavenly mastery bind, With chain unseenâthe quick and restless mind; And thy calm smile hath ofttimes gently wrought A charm to enthrall the feelings and the thought: Yeaâeven the mighty and mysterious powers Of Feeling and of Thoughtâin some soft hours Submit themselves unto a rule, as mild As thineâOh! fair, and calm, and undefiled! The starsâand that sweet moon, with their clear rays, Can chase away pale terrors and dismays; Such as at times in night's deep reign oppress The spirit with a vain and fond distress. Too apt that spirit is to wander far, 'Mid dreams where doubts and contradictions areâ Through hidden paths to rambleâand to dwell 'Mid shades, whose gloom it strives not to dispel. Oh weakness! oh worst folly! when we know In what blessed channels our quick thoughts should flowâ For there are glad and glorious certainties, For ever shining out before our eyesâ Bright certainties of heavenly things sublimeâ Beyond all things of earthâall things of time! Certainties of beatitudes and joys, That shall be oursâwhen this life's vile annoys Are all forgottenâif we fix our trust High above this frail world of death and dust! Shall shadows dark, round our vex'd spirits frown, Where vainly Heaven's rich promises shine downâ Like stars o'er desertsâstars whose lovely light No wells of water there glass back as brightâ Reflecting each fair splendour of the sky, Trembling, as though with their deep harmony? And shall this be? Oh Folly! and Oh Shame! Ours were the error allâand ours the blame! How do our early feelings die away, As we pursue in life our wildering way. To leave full oft a yawning void behindâ A void e'en in the Heartâand in the Mind! Unless new feelingsâhaply deeper stillâ The hollows and the channels rise to fill! Into these hollows, and these channels poured, Till heart and mind are thus with fresh wealth stored. But, have mine early feelings died away? No! though, in sooth, they long have fallen a prey To shadowy Alteration's sweeping powerâ Changedâdarkly changedâsince their first wakening hour! Now hope seems but a flutter of suspense, O'erpow'ringâand distractingâand intense; And Loveâa beautiful and bright despairâ And all of Feelingâbut a weight of care! Each feeling's alteredâyet they have not died, But in my heart like their own ghosts abide! In other daysâhow did they seem to be Fed by thy incense-breathâsweet Poesy, And rapt by Music's heavenly voice of might, To realms of cloudless uncreated lightâ Now like the Spring's young breathingsâsoft and blest, O'er freezing snows on some high mountain's breast, Vainly do Poesy and Music bring Their charms to this lorn heartâa wounded thingâ That owns no more Joy's fair and lovely sway, Filled with sad feelings, hid from light and day! Now Memory strongly rises on my soul, And occupies and fills at once the whole; Fast swells and sweeps its gathering wave of might, On, on it pours as strong and clear as light! And did I deem this lorn and heavy heart, Too long condemned with torturing pangs to smart, A gloomy chaos of Eternal Grief, A wintery world with many a scentless leaf? Lo! beneath Memory's touch that heart o'erworn Laughs into bright creationâas new born! Its wintery world of barrenness and gloom At once a world of summer doth become, Decked in the beauty of a tenfold bloom! Buds, flowers, and fruits, close mingling there appear, And all the varied glories of the year! A world of sunshine and of summer now That long o'ershadowed heart doth brightly grow. But, Memory!âthou hast wrought the magic charmâ 'Tis thou alone canst cheer, and light, and warm; And hast thou now within my Being wrought New Energies of Passion and of Thought? No! no!âthou hast but re-enkindled those That onceâere deadened by destructive woesâ Swayed my deep spiritâboundless, fiery, strong, Alas! what woes did to themselves belong! 'Tis thus in midnight hours of purple gloom The sport of many feelings I become, And shed in mournful mood fast flowing tears O'er the remembrances of bygone years; While to the aching breast of sleepless grief The wildest tears bring slight and faint relief, And still the unanswered heart oppressedâoppressedâ Bleedsâvainly bleeds in the unsolaced breast! MUSIC AND MEMORY. 'Tis the sweet strain I heard in days of yore!â That soft sweet strain calls back those days once more, And while its blessed breathings richly float, Some long-lost feeling lives in every note. Oh! were I blest as I of old was blest, These sounds might not distract the awakened breast; Then, then might I those strains untortured drink, But now each note seems an electric link To bind my present to my shadowy past, With sweet, sweet shock, that makes me shrink aghast! Not only floats this strain i' the haunted air, The Music of old Memories trembles there. Ayeâin the pale blue haunted air around There floats a Music far past that of Sound! And for awhile its power triumphant flings Beauty, and Joy, and Glory o'er all things! Yet a pale Beautyâfaint, and vague, and strange, A melancholy Joy, and full of change; And a most shadowy Glory, such as dwells Round setting suns that smile their last farewells 'Mid gathering clouds, which gloomily forestall The approach of Night, and weave Day's funeral-pallâ Oh! thou Sweet Strain I heard and loved of yore, Wake these vain Memories of the past no more! MOURNERS OF EARTH! Mourners of Earth!âOh! ye who weep O'er crushing sorrows dark and deep, Ye who to Hope have bade farewell, Ye who 'mongst gloomiest shadows dwell, Oh! but the Midnight of your Sorrow May have a glad and glorious Morrow! There may be miseries, ills, and woes, And cares, that never win repose In this strange world, where day by day We find the enchantments fade away; But oh! this world 'tis passing ever, And from its scenes, we all must sever. Mourners of Earth! perchance your part, Though now your minds with anguish smart, Is not a heavier one to bear Than theirs who mingle joy with care, Those who indeed rejoice with trembling, For ever to themselves dissembling! Seeking to make themselves believe Their hearts with no vain doubtings heave, Till even their happiness becomes, In this dim sphere of clouds and tombs, More of a keen pain than a pleasureâ A richâbut treasure-draining treasure! Although possessedâyet evermore Costing a deep priceâo'er and o'er! For fearful things are heart-joys here! While Death, and Change, and Doom are nearâ Here Love and Death have awful meetings, Checking the deep heart's fevered beatings! Mourners of Earth! no more ye'll find How every rose with thorns is lined, The blaze of changeful life shall ne'er Blind ye with its delusive glareâ There is a Peace which Heaven bestoweth, Which but the heart that hopes not knoweth. Mourners of Earth! methinks for ye 'Tis well 'mongst shadowing clouds to beâ What though those clouds which dim your day One breath of Love might clear away, One breath of Loveâone breath of Gladness, Might bring ere long a deeper Sadness! Then, Mourners! still be Mourners here, Joy hath its baneâand Hope its fear; But Joy and Hope no more shall shine With light deceitful as divine, To eyes of agonizing weeping, Which meet kind glances but in sleeping. Mourners of Earth!âOh! ye who 've lost The Dear Ones that you cherished most, No offices of tenderness May now your crushed existence bless; But they are saved from grief and mourning, For whom your heavy hearts are yearning. And still in Heaven they claim your love, And draw your faithful thoughts above, Earth's mightiest affections fail, And all our feelings are but frail; But where the awful grave hath bound them, A holiness seems to surround them. Then, though no more kind looks and words May wake your heart's still sleeping chords, Nor all the love which they express Thrill ye with glowing happiness, From many sources ye may borrow A solace for your cherished sorrow! Though, hapless Ones! for you 'tis true Morn's radiant skies smile dimly blue, And gloomy seems that gracious hour Which glorifies the tree and flower, And fills all Earth with bloom and sweetness, For you it flies with blessed fleetness! That hour, and all the hours that pass So swiftly and so soonâAlas! Ye gladly speed upon their flightâ For Lifeâfor Dayâis Death and Night To yeâwhose hopes are gone before ye, And like the far starsâsmiling o'er ye! All things for ye, however glad, Have something in them soft and sad; There is a cloud for every ray That laughs out on a Summer's day; In the Harp's crowning tones, faint sighings Sound like lorn Echo's last replyings. All things for ye grief-touched appear, Save one thingâin itself most drear, That losesâbut for yeâits gloom, That saddest thing on Earthâthe Tomb! By you, the hapless broken hearted, To a bright temple 'tis converted! Though Morning with her sungifts all Hath undertones in her blithe call, And shadows of deep gloom ye see, Where no dim mournful shadows beâ The Night, when the long Day is ended, For ye more starry seems and splendid. The Night reminds of other things, And many a soaring thought it brings, And lifts the Mourner's heart above, Upon the wings of faith and love! Yesâwhile the immortal stars are shining, The wretched cease their fond repining. The ever glorious Sun of Day Decks the glad Earth in bright array, But these sweet Stars, with their faint light, Attract to Heaven the yearning sight, Soon as their soft reign is beginning, To Heaven the thoughts and feelings winning. Oh! Earthly Hope! say, what art thou Whose charms still countless hearts avow, A meteor gleaming among tombs, To show their terrors 'mid their glooms; But Heavenly Hope! thou shin'st and soarest, And at the Eternal Throne adorest. Mourners of Earth!âperchance 'tis well For ye on Earth 'mid shades to dwell, To turn dimmed agonizing eyes On the rich blush of Morning's skies, And fix your thoughtsâthe sad and lonely, On Heaven and Heavenly Prospects only! LOVE'S JOYS AND SORROWS. Oh! Love hath joys and Love hath sorrows too, Sorrows for ever keenâjoys ever new! They who from doubt, and strife, and change would fly, Must fly from Loveâand Fear, his pale Ally; Hoard up their Heart's deep precious waters all, Nor let them flow to waste, at Love's false call, Then shall the halcyon form of perfect Peace Brood o'er themâand their calm shall never cease, And o'er them too shall float the unfleeing Dove Of the EverlastingâHeavenlyâChangeless Love, All fraught with breathless tenderness and Truth, And calm shall be their age, and calm their youth Who thus with wisest care beneath the sun, The fearful sway of earthly passion shun!â Aye, though they love not that which is of Earth, Though they love not the things of mortal birth, The mighty fountains of the Heart still flow, Even while they move through this dim world below. They loveâthey feelâthey consecrate the heart To things from All Life's vanities apartâ And while 'tis saved from deep and dreadful woe, The fountains of the Immortal Heart still flow! (To quicken into glorious Seas of Light, Unshadowed by one cloud of threatening night, When Life's dark hour at length hath fleeted past, And all its cares are to oblivion cast,) Those fountains may be checked, but never dried, And they shall swell to an eternal tideâ When shines that light of heaven which ne'er grows less, Over their whole existenceâstrong to blessâ Love's wonderous powers can die not in the Soul, 'Tis Heaven hath kindled them throughout the whole. With all our boundless BeingâLove is blent, And we are chained by bonds none ever rent. And Earthly Loveâe'en Earthly Love can raise The spirit high o'er Life's distracted mazeâ And to the Heavenly Love, the pure indeed, May brightly and with fine gradations lead; And when the glorious twain together twine, They both appear e'en equally divine. Yea, and in sooth, where suffering and where woe, From Love may darkly spring and sadly flow, Even there doth something precious and august Lift the rapt soul above its coil of dust; Then say not Love, even Earthly Love, is vain, Though it may lead to wretchedness and pain, To dark regret, and many a gloomy ill. Oh! Love's the Soul of Heaven's creation still! Its very tears are precious as the stars, Which shine above to smile down Earth's vile jars; These sparkle like etherial dazzling gems, Fitted for bright and heavenly diadems! Oh! say not Love is vainâit is not vain, Death shall give up to it his power and reign; The World, the SunâTime, Fate, shall it survive, And everlastingly rejoicing live! Though it may cause at times the deadliest grief, Yet of Earth's best of blessings 'tis the chief! Though it may make the chastened bosom smart, And deeply wound the lorn unanswered heart, And check the spirit with a mortal chill, Yet Love's the soul of the Creation still! 'Tis still a glorious and immortal Sun, Although at times, in sooth, a clouded one! AN EVENING PROSPECT. Fair, fairest Prospectâfairest hour, When slowly over tree and tower The light full softly wanes and fades, As though the sunbeams turned to shades! Now, dewy gems are scattered round Meet for a Monarch robed and crowned With sweeping stole and jewelled vest; And still these gems might shame the rest. The scene seems like a fairy world, With Evening's stainless dews empearled! Fair, fairest Prospectâfairest time, Still fairer than the hour of Primeâ While all is dusk, and all is soft, And gentle breezes whispering, waft Sweet tidings from the Stars, that come To smile and shine away the gloom. Dear is the Evening's tranquil hour In the domestic household bower, The Evening's peaceful hour is dear Where shines the firelight's glow to cheer, While smile around the happy hearth Young faces mantling o'er with mirth, While many a pleasing tale is told Of fairy-charms and genii old; Of history too, and travelled loreâ A rich and ever varied store! But Evening's hour is far more fair Out in that fresh sweet open air, Where play the Summer-breathing gales, Where floats the hum from populous vales, And gracious glooms and slumberous shades Spread softly as the daylight fades Though there, to gladden and to cheer, No firelight glow shines bright and clear. Fair, fairest Prospectâfairest hour, The dews gleam out o'er bank and bower, On quivering leaves and drooping stems, More lovely than the mine's rich gems, Those splendid flowers of the inner Earth, Not doomed to perish from their birth; That never droop, that never fade, Ever in glorious light arrayed. Beautifulâbeautiful are they, Nor destined unto quick decay; Ever full-blown and ever fair, These splendid flowers that flourish there, Deep in the dark Earth's secret breastâ Untouchedâunchangedâin radiant rest, Oh! ever beautiful and bright, Those precious things of solid light! But these pure dews are yet more fair Out in the fresh sweet open air; Still lovelier, finer gems are these That tremble to each passing breeze, Though, unlike those that richly line The deep recesses of the mine, They sparkle their brief life away, While glittering gleams each coloured ray, Within a short and bounded space, And are no more seen in their place! The very flowers on which they shine, That freshly wreathe and brightly twine, In many a chaplet, rich and rare, Outlastâoutlive them proudly there! Oh! fairest Prospectâfairest timeâ More precious than the hour of Prime, No breath of busy Life is here, Save that soft stealing on the ear; A murmurous hum comes, light and low, From time to timeâthen dies off slow At first, when sinks the glowing Sun, When Day and all its pomps are done, When the faint light declining fades, And gather round the Evening's shades, We shrink from the increasing glooms, And from the Night that onward comes; But then, by soft and slow degrees, We find a thousand things to please; Ever the scene more lovely grows, And thousand beauties doth disclose! So, when Joy's radiant reign is o'er, Sorrow hath priceless gifts in store; If sometimes, sternly to affright, She darkens to a stormy night, How oft, in this strange world, how oft Her Evening aspect smileth soft; How oft, by slow degrees, doth she Win us her lovely charms to see. Oh! still to sacred Sorrow bend, And she may prove a gracious friend. In the poetic heart and mind Still is she fittingly enshrined, For endless treasures spring up there, Beneath her swayâdivinely fairâ And thus that wounded heart becomes O'ershadowed by her gathering glooms; A casket rareâa precious urn, Where glorious jewels hidden burn, The bright Sun of Prosperity May bring sweet flow'rets fair to see, That bud and bloom, and smile and shine, And fade, and alter, and decline, But 'tis in caverns dark and lone That slowly forms the precious stone, Where no glad laughing sunny rays Break through to feed the glorious blaze; And thus the Sorrow-darkened Mind May with rich treasure-heaps be lined, Though hidden from the common eye In that deep lonely sanctuary! Like reliques none may dare assail Within the Temple's solemn veil! Oh! still to Mighty Sorrow bend, Thy Patron she may prove, and friend! Fair, fairest Prospectâfairest hour, When gently, over tree and tower, The sunlight wanesâthe daylight fades, And leaves the world to dreams and shades! 'TWAS THY SMILE. 'Twas thy smile, oh! thou false one! who lov'st me not now, Which burst the first buds Passion wreathed round my brow, The first faint folded buds which unopened await The sunshine of Fortune, the spring-smile of Fate! 'Twas thy smile, oh! the brightest that e'er beamed on earth, Which first woke these fair buds into beautiful birth; Around thee there streamed a fine atmosphere bright, An atmosphere rife with Heaven's own precious light; This thou seemedest to breathe round thee gloriously still, Oh! how could I then think 'twould but end in dark ill, So lovely wert thouâand so lovely seemed Love, A gloryâa raptureâsent down from above. How I worshipped that smile which on me deigned to beam Beyond all that the wildest of fancies could dream! Shun Memory!âOh! shun that dark, death-like Despair, Which crushed me when Love's hope first melted in air, When first my soul lost its Life's sweet crowning light, And my Being was bowed as beneath some harsh blight, When my heart seemed to lose its own deep, vital spring, And my hopes and my joys in a moment took wing! Shun Memory!âAh! shun that dark hour of Despair, So fatal, so fellâwhen Life's paths once so fair, Were o'erclouded by anguish, and shadowed by fear, And all grew most deadly that once was most dear. On that heavy despair, Memory, dwell not in gloom, Which broke in black horrors like shadows of Doom Around me, and burst on my shocked, startled sight, Like the terrible frown of a wild storm-rack'd Night! Thou wert beautiful ev'n as some bright dream of old On the minds of the love-inspired sculptors unrolled, When they stood as entrancedâearnest, fervent, and lone, And burnt their deep souls through the fine featured stoneâ How thy Beauty shone down on my soul bright and clear, And each moment then made thee more utterly dear; But I found thee ere long yet more faithless than fair, And my hopes and my joys all were melted in air! Oh! my Love it was but like a dream of the heart, Then let it be dream-likeâso dream-like depart! And, alas! without joy, without strength, trust, or hope, With all Life's wond'rous mysteries henceforth must I cope? And my heart was so joyousâmy soul was so free, It was once such a blissâsuch a raptureâto beâ But the canker can ruin the freshest of flowers That perfume the breeze in the Summer's glad hours; The cloud-shadows dim ev'n the fair dazzling snow, O'er which nothing beside may one soiling stain throwâ Oh! once my Soul's Sea of deep waves, full and strong, Seemed rolling in freedom and gladness along, All brightened and smoothed by pure exquisite love, Till they answered the Heaven that was shining above. Oh! once, once I felt notâin Hope's cloudless dayâ The wearisome contact with Earth and with clay; But now every light that once lit my young path Is hidden by shadows of terror and wrath; Every wreath that I wore is now faded and changed, And from freedom and gladness my soul is estranged. The crown of Life's joys is now crushed with dismay, And each gem and each star-spark hath fallen away! And Love's bright dazzling moments for ever are pastâ Oh! would that their memory might fade off as fast! 'Twas thy smile! 'twas thy smile! oh thou false one, as fairâ That first taught me to breathe Passion's exquisite air! 'Twas thy smile! Oh the loveliest that e'er wakened Love! That first bade me Devotion's deep ardours to proveâ 'Twas that smile which bade Nature all suddenly start Into life yet more splendidâthe life of the Heart! For all things! yea, all things! in the earth, in the airâ At once seemed one feeling profoundly to share. 'Twas the feast of the feelingsâthe sway of the soulâ And one sense seemed to kindle up Nature's vast whole. If these memoriesâso vain and so vividâmust lastâ Let me knowâlet me feelâlet me breathe but the pastâ Let me see but thy smile in my soul stamped and set, Still remember the Pastâbut the Present forget! THE PARTING. We parted in a sweet and touching hour Of dreamy influence, and of deepening power; The evening's hour of beauty and of restâ When Earth is garbed as in a Heavenly Vest! We partedâbut my heartâmy fervent heartâ Ere thou and thy deep memories so can partâ Thou must be cold, and still, and crushed, and deadâ Thou that hast lived and loved, and ached and bled! Round these fond memories, each despair's dark springâ My heart's coiled fibres to the last will cling! We parted in a Sweet and Sacred hourâ Rich Summer laughed o'er every leafy bower; And tender Evening reigned with gentlest swayâ And Daylight beautifully died away! Summer is here again! and all around With fresh and fairy Loveliness is crowned. She reignsâher Reign the glad Earth proudly owns, With all her breezy triumphsâher glad tones: Her sounds of Singing Waters, clear and free, And all her fair shows of festivity; The birds, the song of birdsâhow doth it float Through the sweet air, note intertwined with note; No rainbowed shell's maze hollowed wreathings close, All delicately tinged with blushful rose, More complex to the observant eye appear Than those mixed melodies unto the ear. She reigns in Beautyâbut to me her reign Can bring but Memories fraught with torturing pain; And Evening reigns too with her tender sway, And dies the Day with beautiful Decay; For even Decay is beautiful and fair, Most exquisite and softly lovely there, Where fades the light by delicate degrees, And even the dimly gathering gloom can please. Still some things sorrowful are lovely too, And gently seem our fond regard to woo; The nightingale doth mourn with loveliest noteâ Sweet the sad music of her throbbing throatâ A precious and a rich and crowning strain, Though telling such deep tales of passionate Pain; And dear is gentle Evening's soft decline, More dear than suns when in full blaze they shine; And the slow death of many-sparkling Light Is still a mournfully enchanting sight! Yes! there may be some thingsâa precious few, Both sorrowful and deeply lovely too; But not of such the Heart's harsh love-born grief, Darkâdreadâwithout reposeâwithout relief! The lesser griefs of life may sometimes wear A tender charmâan aspect mild and fair, And then the aspiring Mind, still buoyed by Hope, And by too many dream-world's girt to droop, Many even its Sorrows pleasingly convert To something like delightâunharmed, unhurt; But not among Life's lesser griefs can be Wronged, injured Love's o'erwhelming Misery! Existence then is bound as with a chain Of infinite and desolating Pain; Nor shall that chain its galling links unwind From the choaked thoughts, and from the tortured mind! True, though it should not be from fetters freed, Within the mind may a stern calm succeed To poignant agony and piercing grief, But still that calm, it scarce can be relief, Like some dark sullen Sea, then lies that Mindâ And oh! the sweeping thunders of the windâ The Sprayâthe Stormâthe Struggleâand the Strife, Are better than that gloomy Death in Lifeâ That heavy calmâthat deep and dreadful gloomâ That dull and sombre silence of the tomb. 'Tis Evening now, and it was Evening then, When we two partedânot to meet again; But now comes slowly onâin deepening Might The proud, and regal, and victorious Night, In all her awful Dignity Supreme She comes, and Earth is wrapt in one soft Dream. Oh! Mysteries of thick Darknessâdeep as Doom, Magnificence of Majesty of Gloom! Her dusky, cloudy, old Magnificence, Her solemn Pomp, even awfully intense!â How do they smite the strongly-ruffled Soul, While gorgeous Dream-clouds through its Silence roll; And nobly, proudly then it makes its own The untouched, the unseen, the unfathomed, and the unknown; This pleasure still is mine! though all but this Of Earth's enjoyments and of feeling's bliss, Must be to me for evermore deniedâ This still is mine, with loftiest thoughts allied. Hope, Hope and Happinessâto both farewellâ With both, in brighter days, 'twas mine to dwell, From both 'tis now my gloomy fate to fly, And wrapt in thoughts of these bright days to sigh. Oh, Hope! thou Dream! whose Scenes but Shadows are, Oh, Happiness! thou ever falling Star! To both farewellâa late but long farewellâ Rent is the chain and broken is the spell! But feeling still is mineâthough this can be Henceforth but sorrow and despondency; Yet welcome be its wretchedness and woe, Still let my Soul's deep fountains freely flow! The wretch who, sunk in apathetic Peace, Finds these keen torments, these sharp suff'rings cease, Who languidly exists, who coldly breathes, Escapes a thousand pangs, a thousand deaths; But better these than such a lifeless Life, Oh! better all the Agonies of Strifeâ The acute Anxietiesâthe poignant Painâ Than such stagnation of the Heart and Brain! We parted in a sweet and solemn hour Of dreamy influence and of deepest powerâ We partedâwe are partedâand 'tis o'erâ And allâonce all to meâcan be no more! THE FESTAL HOUR. A Festal Hourâbring wreathsâbring harpsâbring lampsâa Festal Hour! Call Pleasure's favourite votaries now to Pleasure's gilded bower; Assemble now the Lovely Ones in the gay and glitt'ring hallsâ Rubies and roses burning deep 'midst their Hair's perfumed falls; Soft Flattery's incense shall salute ere long their listening ears, And gentlest words shall soothe away their bashful maiden fears, Till happy sighs shall sweetly through their honeyed accents thrill, And soften them to lovelier and to dearer music still! While radiant smiles shall tremble round their lips that blush apartâ The smile of Beauty's tendernessâsweet Sunstroke of the Heart! True, lovelier might sound Love's first words beneath the greenwood shade, When soft and slow the Evening light had dwindled and decayed, Where Nature's vernal splendours spread in glorious pomp around, Than here where gleam the dazzling lamps, and rings the loud harp's sound. Where Love's words come down on the Soul, the moved and ruffled Soul, Like moonbeams when o'er troubled seas, o'er broken waves they roll! Soft, lovely in themselves they are, serene and gently mild, But tossed upon those stirring waves, they too seem strange and wild; For moved and ruffled is the Soul 'mongst festal scenes like these, As waters of the sounding Sea, are ruffled by the breezeâ For me, I sorrowing, silent move amidst the gladsome train, To me the sounds of joy bring griefâand pleasure gives but pain! To me, to me, are nothing now the words of Flatt'ry's tongue, Or more, the words of Passion's breath, whereon once I raptured hung, The old, precious, household words of Loveâto me long, deeply dear, No more may greet my watchful sense, nor court my longing ear; And therefore 'tis I wander 'mongst the idle and the gay, And therefore 'tis I sickening turn from these light sounds away!â I wander there in vain, vain hope, that it may bring reliefâ Unto my aching lonely heartâmy spirit's yearning grief; But still remembering those blest words, so hallowed and so dearâ I shrink from Flattery'sâPassion's tones, with grieved and wounded ear! Ah! how many thus even like myself, may join the joyous throng, With aching hearts and sorrowing minds, mingling the Gay among? But whoâwho are the gay? and who the happy and the free? Ah! could we rend the veil that hides the much we should not seeâ And could we rend that covering veilâand push the mask asideâ And bid them put away their cloak of vanity and pride; Then when that mask was pushed asideâthat veil was rent awayâ We might indeed ask mournfullyâbut whoâwho are the gay? In deeply bosomed sorrow some have joined the splendid train, That yet would not for worlds on worlds be set free from their painâ While evermore they woo and win to wander by their side, Some Phantom of some gentle thingâthat loved, and sunk, and died! Some Phantom of some lovely thing that now hath fled awayâ And they have mingled 'mongst the throngâand they are of the gay! Those that they loved are freeâare flownâand they 'midst others mix, Secure none otherâever may their winged affections fix! Their winged affectionsâthat on high with quenchless longing soarâ Fettered to this dull gloomy earth, this shadowy world no moreâ Where all things that are lovely come, but for a little while, O'er poor Mortality's marked path to flutter and to smile!â And these are of the gay! theseâthese who inly mourn and groanâ And they assume the careless smileâaffect the cheerful tone! And some are there, who vainly have, through tumult and through wrath, Toiled in Ambition's slippery ways, and veiled and dangerous path; Who have slaved beneath her iron reignâand rued her fearful swayâ And worn their noblest energies, their proudest powers away? And vainly worn, while others gained the prize for which they stroveâ And they amongst the Crowd appearâamidst the gay they move! And some are there who have been made Love's victimsâwrongedâbetrayed! Whose every hope was wrecked at once, when Love's fair wreath decayed; And they smoothe down, and brightly wreathe the coiled up glossy braidsâ And mingle in the lovely throng, of happier, brighter maids. Upon these glossy coiled up wreaths they place the Crown of flowers, And join the joyous concourse then, to smile away the hours, While Grief's fell hungry canker-worm is preying on their hearts, And vain for them are Pleasure's wiles, and Flattery's specious arts. Who are the gay? Oh answer this! Whoâwho then are the gay? Many may seem soâwhile in sooth they are bitterest Sorrow's prey; But let them seem soâ'tis indeed a harmless bright deceit, And forces others too to smile, and one same task repeat; The soft infection gently spreads throughout the festive crowdâ Oh! where would be a festive throng, where hidden truths avowed? WHAT SHALL BE MISSED? The Doveâthe fond, fond turtle Doveâ What truth dwells in her breast; Oh! what a Shrine of perfect Love Must be her hallowed nest. Lovingly plies she her sweet care Midst the deep greenwood shadesâ And Love's own brightest Star shines there, The Star that never fades! The Larkâthe glad rejoicing Larkâ He makes the Sky his own, And soars from Earth the dim and dark, And mounts as to a throne! Heaven, Earth, and Air, resounding ring With his triumphant strain; Then who can think of such a thing As Sorrowâor as Pain? The Rose shines forth in splendour brightâ Fairest of flowers that blowâ It is a rich and rare delight To gaze on that red glow! The Queen of gardens and of bowers, She reigns with tenderest sway; And all the radiant tribe of flowers To her must homage pay. The dew drop sparkles on the leaf Ere yet its life is o'er; For fragile is that Life, and briefâ A momentâand no more! But oh! thou gentle turtle dove, Ere long must thou depart; And who shall miss the perfect love That heaves thy little heart? And Lark! rejoicing rapturous bird, When Death shall be thy shareâ When thy deep song no more is heard, Shalt thou be missed in air? Rose! loveliest, sweetest of all flowers, When thou hast drooped and died, Shalt thou be mourned for in the bowers, With all thy bloom and pride? Bright dewdrop!âwhen the next fair spring Calls forth each flower that blows, Shalt thou be needed, then to fling Sweet coolness o'er their brows? Nothing is missedâand nothing mournedâ Soon is filled up the place Of all that once the Earth adornedâ While race succeeds to race. Whole tribes of turtle Doves shall pour Their souls on love away, Feeling as thou hast felt beforeâ Thou feel'st, sweet birdâto-day! Thousands of larks shall mount as high, And sing a strain as clear, And weave as rich a harmony As thineâwhich now I hear. Thousands of joyous larks shall spring To where Morn's sunbeams shineâ Upon as strong and free a wingâ With hearts as light as thine. Scores of bright roses shall unfold And blush with crimson glow, When thou dost thy rich smile withhold, Sweet Rose! so radiant now. Myriads of dew drops yet shall shine, Like studs of sunny light, With sparkling brilliancy like thine, Fair dew dropânow so bright! LoveâBeautyâMusicâPurityâ These things shall ever last; These things shall never, never die, For them there is no Past! And oh! 'twould be a wretched thing If these indeed could pass, Like Earth's frail children witheringâ But they are of loftier class! They still shall lastâand they shall live, Though all around them dieâ Their mortal tenements survive And light the Eternity! The Lark may die, who sweetly sung, For him shall Day grow dim, But though that living Lyre's unstrung, Music dies not with him! This Rose shall fade, which hues of Light On all seems to confer, But though she bear decay's dull blight, Beauty dies not with her! The dew drop may be quickly dried Beneath Noon's flaming skyâ But though no more with that allied, Purity shall not die! Death will smite sore the turtle Doveâ And still her throbbing heart; But the everlasting Soul of Love Shall ne'er from Earth depart! LINES ON A PRISONED EAGLE. Once most majestical of Earth's free things, How sadly droop thy proud and powerful wingsâ How didst thou once urge far thy stormy course, Tempesting the air around with haughtiest force, And soaring into Heaven's blue arch intense, Gorgeous with uttermost magnificence! Thou scornedst the earthâthou mockedst at the ground, Thou playedst with the elements unbound; And thou art fetteredâthou art now enchained Unto that earth so much by thee disdained. The Sun hath lost his mightiest worshipper, Shattering the old Silence with triumphant stir! Still didst thou pay thy homageâfree and bold, O'ercanopied by clouds of burning gold: At his Eternal and magnific shrineâ Brightly sublimeâillustriously divine! Oh! ye unchanging and outshining skies, Ye wear your crown of old sublimitiesâ Though he who soared into your chrystal height, And drank even at your fountainhead of light, May never more his splendid homage pay At those resplendent courts of radiant day! As richly do ye glowâas brightly smile, Though he be bound and fettered here the while! Poor prisoned Eagle! how didst thou of old With proud audacity and ardour bold Soar statelily and haughtily on high, Even when the tempest brooded in the sky, Sailing amid the thunder-charged storm clouds, That heaved along that sky in leaguering crowds; And now, when Lightnings shiver o'er thy head, Thou cowerest, chained and dungeonedâworse than dead! Thou biddest us think of the immortal Mind Entombed on Earth, and cabinned, and confined! While still 'tis wakened, rapt, inspired, o'erwrought By things mysterious to its troubled thought, And tempted other regions to explore, And strongly moved to glorious heights to soar; And yet the while from these bright regions thrust, And prisoned down in darkness and in dust. Yes! of that Mind like some embodied ray, That mindâso shrouded in its mortal clayâ Art thou, oh! fettered Eagle!âbound and chained, And harshly curbed, and heavily constrained, Like some embodied ray of mighty mind That fain would leave its earthly home behind, Yet is condemned to suffer and to sigh Far from its proper clime, its native sky! But thou hast deeper cause to faint and droop, Uncheered like that with a Majestic Hope! Thy being hath a limit and a bound, And thou must still lie fettered to the ground; But that shall yet rejoicing soar away Into the Ethereal regions of the Day. The hour for that assuredly shall come Which yet shall see it gain its Heavenly Home! Yes! in some future though some far off hour Shall it career in Glory, Triumph, Power, And win a deep and everlasting Dower! And rend a way through glorious worlds on high, Bathed in the boundless splendours of the sky! And then more free than the unbridled wind Shall be that lightened and enfranchised Mind; Then shall its thoughts, far loftier than before, Melt in unlapsing music evermore. Borne o'er Earth's triumphsâfervoursâagoniesâ Into the placid calm of yon pure skies; Then shall be opened to its raptured sight Worldsâflooding worlds with cataracts of Light! Then shall it glow with fires of quenchless truth, And revel in divine Eternal Youth! And gaze on mysteriesâopened and revealedâ That long had been from human senses sealed! Oh! yet that mindâthat deep immortal mindâ Shall leave its trammels and its ties behind. Thou art not like itâEagle!âbound and chainedâ That shall not be for evermore constrained! CONTEMPLATIONS IN SOLITUDE. The golden Summer Heavens have lavished here The bright luxuriance loveliest climates wear! The beauty of the fair and fervid day Smiles o'er the Earth, as though 'twould ever stayâ Unchangedâunchilled!âSweet promise! but how vain Each morn must passâeach glowing noon must wane; Each wreath of joy must perish and decay, And all we love must fleet and die away; All things must bowâas all have bowed beforeâ To Death! the strong one! Rock of Hope's bright shore; Life's gilded barks come gaily hurrying on, But to be dashed to fragments thereâundone! Death! ever when I dwell in solitude, Dost thou impress my mind's deep dreamy mood; Though none can fixedly e'er look on thee, Since still thou seemest, pale shade, to melt, to flee! From the long-yearning painful gaze we cast, On the dread conqueror of the captive past! And yet at times, how strangely, deeply near, The Pale Oneâstern and sombre doth appearâ The Pale One! He the unearthly form of Fear! Even now I greet him with an awe profoundâ My soul of souls his presence doth surround! And while it labours with that thought of Deathâ Passion melts from it, like some snow-wrought wreath! Oh! thou whose valveless vaultâwhose keyless keepâ Contains all those who walked on earth to weep! All tribes and nations that have seen the sun, And the short race of mortal trial run; All vileâall virtuousâand all weak and wiseâ For all lie there concealed from kindred eyes; All who have nameless and neglected diedâ All who through Earth's old Empires proud and wide Sent their deep nameâtheir deep and deathless nameâ To dwell for aey, with Memory and with Fame; For all their mighty echoes to repeat, For future ages rapturously to greet For ever and for everâall from whom The Light of Life hath meltedâturned to gloom; How doth the shadow of thy presence cast A hue that clouds the Present like the Pastâ All sternly sombreâand all sadly still, Our souls beneath that burthening presence thrill; Whether 'tis where the humble village spire Points to the Heavensâno pyramid points higher! And the sepulchral groundâthe hallowed groundâ Lies heaped on many slumbering heads around; Or where the gayâthe greatâthe busy crowdâ Where the vast cities' roar is long and loud, And palaced streets spread lengthening fair and proud; Or where rush wild the mountain's swollen floods, Or the deep Funeral Shades of sounding woods; Blackened by mighty firsâin gloom extend, Thickening and darkening, ever without end; Or where sweet sunny vales laugh bright and fair, To shades unknownâto Light and Heaven laid bare! Death! Death! if thou art thereâall seems around, Within thy chain of ghastly terrors bound; And this all-wonderful and glorious Earth, So oft resounding with the voice of mirthâ In its magnificence of StrengthâLightâBloomâ Appears one vast and proudly Vaulted Tomb! But Earth shall yet behold the mighty hour, Which must deprive thee of thy fearful power! When called from thee, and doom, and dust to part, Her summoned sons shall from her bosom start! Uplifted from their bed of ages then, And quickened into Being once againâ While she herself is split, and racked, and riven, And bared before the burning eye of Heavenâ And scathedâby thunder-stroke on thunder-strokeâ Half crushed to flame-transpierced mist and smoke! Which, 'mid the horrors of that final storm, A troubled halo fearfully shall form Around the heads of those who long had slept, And the strict fast of Death's stern mystery kept! Still, when my Soul dwells deep on thee, oh! Death! Each passion melts like snow in pallid wreath; And leaves it calm, and holy, and resigned, While solemn thoughs arise within the mind; And 'tis not marvellous that when alone, The thoughts should take a sad and sombre toneâ And dwellâOh! dark and awful Death on thee, With whom all living must so shortly be! And yet, this lovely World doth ne'er appear To shrink from thee with any gloomy fear!â Though scarce a spot smiles on its glorious face, That is not, Death! thy Province and thy Place! Yet oh! the bloom, the splendour, and the lightâ That crowns it still, as Earth laughed in despite At thy worst terrorsâand rejoiced without One shadow of despondence or of doubt! SONG, ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE. In the time of blossoms and of birds, We wept our whispered farewell words! Those haunting sounds, that oft return, To dreaming ears and hearts that mourn! The air was one charmed world of sound, A waste of colours seemed the ground; Rich was the greensward's rainbowed breast, With flowers by their own sweets oppressed! In the time of blossoms and of birds, We wept our whispered farewell words; But Hope still lingeredâsweetly nearâ And charmed away the gathering tear. Life was one hurrying burning dreamâ One chainless and exulting stream Of witcheriesâgloriesâand delightsâ Doomed to endure Time's cankering blights. Oh! fearful was the awakening hour, Fearful its trace of withering power! And Memory's whispers, sadly stillâ Through all my trembling being thrill! NOT NOW! NOT NOW! Not now! not now! I would not sorrowing hear, Victorious music pealing sweet and clearâ Thrilling with Passion's heart-quakes! Oh! not now! A shadow and a pallor stain my brow; Soft echoes! bring me to assuage my woeâ The broken music of th' Old Long ago! Not now!âalas! not nowâwould I behold The festal hall, that burns with sculptured goldâ Where pictured walls glance back the flood of lightâ All spiritually intense and bright! On such gay scenes mine eyes with tears I cast, Give me a tremulous moon-ray of the past! Not now!ânot now!âcould I delighted strayâ Where glistening waters, singing on their way, Make the earth jubilant with wakening sound, Where flower-scents break forth from each greensward mound; No! lead me to indulge my deepening gloom, To the hushed precincts of some time-worn tomb. Not now!ânot now!âo'erworn with burdening woes, Would I the Poet's glorious page unclose; Whence Thoughts, like breathing Sun-strokes, flash and burn, And Nature's founts stream free as from an urn! No! to an altered heartâEarth's weariest thingâ Memory! thy pale and cloud-dimmed pictures bring. THE GRAVE OF THE GIFTED. A Grave for the Gifted!âWhereâwhere shall it be? By the echoing shores of the hollow-voiced Sea? Oh, no! let those ashes at last sink in restâ Now the strong Passion-whirlwinds have died in her breast! For the Gifted and Beautiful lost Oneâa grave, But not in the precincts of Ocean's hoar wave; Too much of life's tempests and tumults she knew, Let her sleep 'neath the Skies' gracious weepings of dew! Like a bird from the stormsâall awearied, o'erwornâ To a nest of repose be the Lovely One borne, Where no loud savage storm shakes the moon-lighted Air, But the breeze, a sweet message from Heaven's shore shall bear! A Grave for the Gifted!âWhereâwhere shall it be? Where the bright summer-treasures yield wealth to the beeâ Where the faint-thrilling voice of some fountain is heard, And the rich air is rent by Night's passionate bird. Where old chestnut-trees shed round a twilight of gloom, Which doth hallow and mellow the wild flower's meek bloom, Where the fragrant Spring-rains dance in joy to Earth's breastâ Sweet Earth!âwith a blossomy richness oppressedâ Where the whitest of roses undazzlingly blow More pure and more soft than the enwreathed Mountain-Snowâ Where the Starlight still tremblingly signal the Hours, And throw sudden gleams o'er the wood-bosomed bowersâ Where the sunflower shall burn, and the lily shall bend! And the Acacia its leaves with the willow's shall blendâ Oh! the old Kingly Laurel's illustrious gloom Overshadowed her lifeâbe that far from her tomb! A Grave for the Gifted!âA Grave for the Young! Since sealed the pure lips that so thrillingly sung; But far from the Laurelâthe Tempestâthe Billowâ Where stillness is deepest, there spread ye her pillow! LAMENT OF AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS. The Princesses of Egypt are said to have pined for the waters of the Choaspes after being removed from their native land by marriage with foreign Princes. She leaned upon a sumptuous couch, which shone With many a blazing dye and burning stone; Cups of the rose-scented onyx glitter'd there, With many a crystal vase, and cresset fair; The far-off spice-wood's treasures there were heap'd, Till in warm fragrance every breeze was steep'd, That pierced its way through golden trellised bowers, Ruffling the unfolded leaves and lustrous flowers. Silence hung o'er that odorous porphyry hall, Scarce broken by the fountain's lulling fall; Silenceâthough she who sate there, pale and lone, Held a fair lute that pour'd no wakening toneâ But she hath risen now from her dreamy trance, To cast around a wild and mournful glance; The paleness passes from her stately brow, Her form dilates with passion's grandeur now!â Melts from her mien the dull and cold eclipse, The mighty-rushing strain o'erflows her lips!â Exultingly ye still roll on! in melody and power, Streams of my Royal Fatherland!âwith sun-gifts for your dower, Roll onâroll onâexultingly! but, oh! my heartâno more Must to the bounding of your waves bound as 'twas wont of yore. But this is nought. No! nought to ye! proud everlasting streams, Still trembling to the crimson'd light of sultry noontide beams; Still glorying in your billowy course the same as when I stray'd Along your flowering shores beneath the Cedar's feathery shade. Yet there, walk in dark beauty still, old Egypt's regal daughters, Allâall but me, the stricken deer, lone thirsting for its waters; My Sisters! sweet companions of my Childhood's laughing years, Shed ye for me while lingering there Love's vain, unreck'd of tears? And doth my recollected form still haunt your wanderings there, Unwither'd by intense regret, unchanged by burdening care? And doth my recollected voice rise mingling soft and low, With the deep bewildering music of the waves' triumphant flow. Oh, Sisters! dwell in gladness there, ye beautiful and bless'd, Nor dream that on the stranger's shores your young souls might find restâ Ye tender flowers! ye would but droop when chain'd to alien thrones, Pale those pomegranate cheeks would grow, and faint those laughing tones. Though here my step is greeted with the cymbal and the lute, My heart sends no rich answer forthâthe broken shell is mute; Though these porphyry halls are starry with bright wealth of gold and gem, I droop like some night-blowing flower, sun-smitten on the stem! Though here the o'er-arching heav'ns shed down soft splendours o'er the land, And though the rivers bluely roll to a golden-flowering strandâ Tho' these pleasure-shades be emerald bright, these palace-chambers fair, Oh! the Beautifulâthe Beautifulâfor me is only there! Would I might be a drifting leaf, cast on those flashing floods, Where Egypt's precious sunshine in its full-blown radiance broods; For e'en the loveliest sunshine here, to me shines dim and cold, Oh! might I on Choaspes' stream, its gathered rays behold! Oh! that I might my landâmy homeâin breathless transport part, And seek thy odorous shades once more, all matchless that thou art; But clouds have liberty above, and restless birds around, While the Queen of this resplendent land in sumptuous chains lies bound. The jewel-roughened goblet to my throbbing lips I press But to dash it on the marble floor, in a passion of distress; Bring me the blessed waters from those well-known native springs, More lovely than Heaven's vernal dews shed from the Morning's wings. Bear hence these jewelled goblets with their sculptured traceries brightâ The waters sparkling o'er the brim are loathsome in my sight; Bring from Choaspes' worshipped stream the sweet and precious draughts, To quench my fevered thirst at lengthâand soothe my phrenzied thoughts. Forgive! my bosom's lord, forgive, this wild and fitful mood, Forgive, if all thy tenderness my dark soul hath withstood; May'st thou ne'er know what 'tis to pine in weary dreams away, And turn thee sorrowing from the Sun, and all the pomps of day! Thine own fair Land spreads laughingly around thy cloudless path, Thou dost not bend 'neath Memory's power, a tempest in its wrath! The scenes thou'st known and loved of old, still charm thy raptured eyeâ Think with what yearning languishment the Exile's heart must die! Even now a full and fervid dream came sweeping through my mind, Within whose bright transparenceâstreamsâskiesâland-scapesâshone enshrined! Those skiesâthose landscapesâI have loved, and panted to behold! Those streams that gird my Land with Orient hyacinth and gold! I am parted from thee, glorious Home! and the Heavens look coldly down On the banished One, whose aching brows lie crushed beneath a crown; Those Heavensâthose Heavensâthat mirrored burnâdepth within depth unfurled In the hundred hundred Rivers of that Queen-Land of the World! May the wild winds, that proudly go in triumph where they will, Bear to those scenes one murmured tone which from my lip doth thrill! Like wandering flower-seedsâdreamy scentsâor broken whisperings sweet, Shall be the breathings of my Love, borne on their pinions fleet. Oh! that at once my burning soul they thus might waft alongâ To where the founts of glory rollâmajestically strong!â Where musk-winds rich, and sunbeams play!âbirds floatâand flower shades quiverâ Mantling with sudden radiances the old Imperial River! Roll on!âroll ever-sounding on, in melody and power, The amethyst's heart-hues are dim to thy foam's far-gleaming showerâ Oh! when this fainting heart of love hath drooped away and died, May ye to every age bear on a voice of strength and pride! It will be so, immortal Founts!âand that I feel it will, Makes my quick heart with deep delight o'erpoweringly to thrillâ Anguish and Exultation rend a Spirit long o'erwornâ I sinkâI faintâFarewell, glad Skies of Summer and of Morn! Silence once more hung o'er that princely hall, Save ye might hear that wild heart's rise and fall, Loudâquick and loud!âBut now the paleness cold Steals o'er her forehead, 'neath her hair's rich fold. In the swift rushing of that strain went by The mightâthe strengthâof battling Agony, Her darkly-glorious eye is downwards bent, Languor and fervour in its stillness blent; The fringed lid glitters with the unconscious tearâ But, hark! what stealthy step approaches near? What Form hath leant on that flowered ballustrade (In kingly robes, resplendently arrayed, O'er whom the sycamores and myrtles flung Their verdurous shadows) while the Mourner sung? Oh! who hath hastened to that Mourner's side? Raise, raise those drooping eyes! thou Queen! and Bride! Whose whispered tones of love have made thee start? Whose piercing eyes have questioned thy wrung heart? âThat gaze hath brought back the impassioned glow, Like sunset waves, o'er all thy cheek and brow. Who hath thus waked thee from thy second trance By the soft magic of one pitying glance? Crowned Daughter of the Pharaohs! is it he Who bore thee from thy home of Infancy!â And is't for him to bring back Joy's rich smile To thy worn cheekâFlower of the haughty Nile! Oh! Woman!âunto every love thus true, Well may thine hours of rosy calm be few! CHURCHYARD CONTEMPLATIONS. It is a mournful and a solemn spot Where Deathâpale presence!âisâwhere Life is not; And all that would be bright and glad elsewhere, And soft, and sweet, and exquisite, and fair, Here gains a shadowy and a thoughtful gloom, Won from the awful contact of the tomb! Here Summer, royal in her pomp, doth wear A borrowed mournfulnessâwhich all must shareâ A borrowed mournfulness that smites the heartâ The heart which feels ere long 'tis doomed to part, To leave but ashes and but dust behind, For all the burning thoughts within it shrined; The towering energies then slackening droop, Loosed from their strenuous hold on Sky-built Hope, Youth's falcon eye, that drinks the rushing light, And shines as if with fire from Heavenâso brightâ So kindlingly and deeply bright, assumes A fixed, cold stillness 'mongst these Time-worn Tombsâ Youth's burning heart that joyously forgot Fate's awful certaintiesâhere feels its lot, And quiveringly submits, with grief and pain, And owns its glowing day-dreams are but vain! And Age here draws a yet more shortened breath, And faints with an anticipated Death! Throughout all changeful and revolving times, All varying circumstanceâall differing climesâ Thou ever hast thine awful sway maintained, Oh, Death!âand ever ruled and ever reigned; And wheresoe'er thou artâthere broods a power Which bids the cheek turn pale, the pulse beat slower. Here womanâwoman the devotedâlies! Love and her fervid Soulâto yon rich skies Together passed!âfor sure, of Heaven they were, And unto Heaven, Death-freed, they make repair. Ariseâye gentle ones, in joy and power, No more shall mortal anguish be your dower As on this Earthâwhere they who love must know Dark Separation's keen and lasting woe. Not there shall suffering, weakness, doubt, and fear, Be Woman's portionâas they must be here! No more shall dread on her heart's pulses press, Nor her unconquerable tenderness Bow down that head by every beauty crowned, Now o'er ten thousand worlds spread wide around, Even raised triumphantlyâand she is saved From all that pained and wronged her and enslaved! Woman!âdevoted Dreamer!âcanst thou hold To this harsh worldâthe hollow and the cold? And canst thou clingâwith boundless worship cling To every chain, which thou aside shouldst fling, Wouldst thou indeed be calm, and glad, and free, And 'scape the crush of deadliest miseryâ For every tie on Earth is as a chain, To bind thee down to peril and to pain; But what is that to thee?âThrones, Glories, Powers, And star-bright Honours, and celestial Dowersâ Empireâand Majestyâand Strength and Mightâ And Pomp and Powerâand Triumph and Delightâ To thee, were not so precious and so dear, Even as a handful of the frail dust here If sanctified by loveâwhose hallowed breath To thee is worth all roundâaboveâbeneath! But well it is for thee, that 'gainst thy will, Full oft thou'rt spared from worst of grief and ill! And from the scene of many sorrows borne, To realms which ever laugh with beamy morn! Here woman, womanâthe devoted liesâ And yet, not soâshe liveth in the skies! The gloomy grave may bind and hold her notâ Chains, ties, and slavery are indeed forgot; Her march is 'mongst the Seraph ranks above, Whose life like hers is but of boundless love! She is not hereâHeaven's glorious Scenes unrolled, Her meek beseeching eyes may now behold! That in their meekness had so much of mightâ With thoughtful minds, and hearts that felt aright! Nay! all must own, in Life's fond feverish hourâ That glance even multitudinous of Power! Since it can bid keen Passion's lightnings dart Through the most callous and most selfish heart, And make it glow with an immortal fire, And touch, and thrill, and rouse itâand inspire! And it can calm the wild and stormy mind, That rushed like Ocean-waves before the windâ And soften it and sootheâand gently bless With all the sweet repose of tenderness; And it can bid the ambitious spirit turn From all, for which it never ceased to yearn!â And teach it to forsake its fiery path, Where fell the thunderbolts of Strife and Wrath; Or it can stir the sluggish and the slow, And force the heart's long frozen founts to flow! To cold Indifferenceâdull, and dead, and tameâ Give a proud interest and a lofty aim, And kindle it with Zeal's impassioned flame! Or win the o'erwrought Enthusiast from his trance, For boundless, endless power is in that glance!â Womanâwith meekness and with truth arrayed, (The fairest flower that flourishes to fade!) Seems not thy Smile, pure, spiritual, refined, The very Poetry of Soul and Mind, Of the everlasting Mind and deathless Soul, The Poetry that soars beyond controul! Launching on one fleet hour of mortal fate Eternity's sublime and glorious weight!â Yet, oh! that smile, that lights the world around, Too oft it leaves thy heart in darkness bound, While many sorrows pierce thy bosom's fold, And peace and joy Fate's stern decrees withhold, And wronged Affection, wrongedâbut ever trueâ Doth o'er thy path the thorns unsparing strew. What is't to thee then, that the soul of grace Is breathing o'er thy form, and from thy face, That while thou may'st a hopeless mourner be, The treasures of All Beauty meet in thee, That on thine exquisite and precious head A Glory from the far-off Heaven seems shedâ That with enchanting loveliness thou'rt rife, If Love's bright self bless not thine inner life! On thee the light of orbal worlds is showered, With gifts unutterable art thou dowered, Ah! linked with highest things, thou should'st not stoop From the triumphant Altitudes of Hope!â No! thou should'st feel that Soul of Love within Was meant for worlds more pureânot worlds of sinâ That thine own gentle heart and lofty mind Were for a nobler, fairer state designed; And hearken to the Voice of Heaven, which breaks Upon thine inborn sense, and sweetly speaks To tell of brighter things than aught below, Where reigns so much of terror and of woeâ Trust unto all thy heart doth still reveal, Believe in all thou dost so deeply feel, And know'st thou not thy Love can never dieâ A part of thine own immortality! And should'st thou limit then thy Hope and Trust To this frail worldâto ashes and to dust? Oh! yet shalt thou be saved from grief and gloom, And thou and Love be brightly wafted Home! These who now round me rest in solemn sleep, The Grave's unbroken slumber, stern and deepâ The Hamlet's gentle mothers and fair maidsâ (Some snatched away while yet o'er their soft braids Youth's golden light of perfect beauty shone, And some, when their long weary task was done)â These have been bounden all, in Love's strong chain, The Peril knownâthe Passion and the Pain!â These have fulfilled their destinies as well As those who in the hall and palace dwell, Affection's mighty reign is still confessed Strong in a peasant's as a prince's breastâ Toilâhardshipâcare and suffering are in vain To check or limit that triumphant reign; And if unhappy in their love they were, 'Twas their worst suffering and their heaviest care; And if their love was fortunate and blest, Oh! littleâlittle did they heed the rest! Loveâthou one luxury left unto the Poorâ Thou'rt like an Angel-watcher at their door! With nought of vanity commixed or pride, Oh! Love, all luxuries thou art worth beside; And not because these gentle slumberers round Were in a lowly path and humble foundâ And not because in peasant homes they moved Were they less worthyâwere they less well lovedâ Or less enchanting in their station shownâ Oh! no, an equal charm was round them thrown. Nor might the statelier daughters of the land Reign with a softer or more sweet command, For Woman's gentle sovereignty serene Is o'er the heartâthe same in every scene! Here sleeps the infantâhaply, brightly borne From Earth's dim twilight to the realms of morn, Ere it had bowed to Sorrow's tyrant reign, Or known the thrill of grief, the throb of painâ Even as a very lightning of sweet life, That vanished ere it mingled with the strifeâ A Spirit Meteorâthat but came to part Ere Love or Fear had agonized the heart, That precious Spirit may have soared above, Where Knowledge never pierced, but only Love; That precious, precious Spirit, borne away Ere grief could wound or error could betray. Oh! let that Spirit for one strong hour float Around me in my dreams, from gloom remote, And lead mine every yearning thought on high To bask in sunshine of the upper Sky, So overcharged with glory keen and bright, That almost deadly unto mortal sight Were the soul-dazzling splendour of its light! Death! in this lowly, still, and green Retreat, Gently the pondering mind thou seem'st to greet, For, oh! there is a tenderness serene Breathed o'er the quiet of this simple scene, A gracious tenderness, with nought of gloom, Shed o'er each flow'r-besprent and dew-lit tomb, Found not where costly shrines of regal pride Their ghastly tenants in dark splendour hideâ Here waves the grass through many a verdant hour, Glittering beneath the Summer's beam-crossed show'r; MornâEveningâNightâhere mingle evermore With Death's broad shadowâspread o'er Earth's smooth floor! Oh! my deep dreams! my deep and Mighty Dreams, How strong their Empire o'er my Spirit seemsâ (For of HopeâFearâDoubtâAwe and Wonder blentâ These weave about our paths a Web wherein we are pent!) My deep, deep dreamsâthough solemn as profound, They shed a strong and wond'rous charm around, Though many mysteries their vast circle fill, (Too fearfully inextricable still!)â They make the Scene more hallowed and more dear, They make it lovelier and more bright appear! And yet those dreams they are of Death!âwhose power Is felt far more, in such a peaceful hour; For Evening now is slowly coming on, And Day, with all its charms, is nearly done; And Nature speaks with voice of fond appeal, To teach the heart those solemn truths to feel; For still Man's holiest monitress she is, And points his path to wisdom and to bliss; And still she speaks in clear, strong tones, and saith, âBehold incessant changeâcontinual death, Decay still seizing on all forms of mineâ Oh! Man! behold my fate, and think of thine.â Shall Nature's whisp'ring voice, or tempest cry, Alike be scorned by mortalsâborn to die? Shall Nature's thunderings, threatenings, prayers, prove vain, While zealously she storms Man's heart and brain? The Stars, like glowing Visions, float and stream Heaven's living Poetry on every beam; They draw the thought to all which is above, And claim for loftiest, noblest thingsâour love. The gathered Surges of the haughty Sea, Fierce, black, and hoarse, in hours when Storms reign free, Tell fearful tales fraught with profound dismay, Of the utter nothingness of dust and clay. When the Sea rages, wrestling as 'twould rock, With heave convulsive and terrific shock, The mighty Heavens upon its thundering Waves, Of thousands of the Earth the troublous graves, Its voice of strength doth fearfully proclaim How weak is Man in his frail mortal frame, How weak without Almighty help and aidâ A gasping tremblerâpowerless and afraid; And the huge billows lift their heads on high, Like crested Titans, to assault the sky; And frowning Pyramids they seem to form, Seen by the Lightning glimpses of the Storm, As though to build, on Mockery fierce, intent, To those who sink a Moment's Monument! And to their own dark Triumph, proud and high, Their own stern Conquest and dread Victory, A moment's heaving trophy pile sublime, That shames the work of Nations and of time! Dark lifted to the Firmament's broad arch, Vexing the Stars upon their dazzling march! But if in this frameâin this strange brief Life, Oh, Man! thou'rt frail, and weak 'mid Nature's strife, If thou but hearkenest to her counsel sage, And studiest carefully her pregnant page, What more than glory and what more than power, Shalt thou inherit in the appointed hour, When the proud Stars shall pale their heavenly fire, Doomed each in turn to wither and to expire, When the great Sun shall powerless wax and old, His rays grown feeble, and his rich smiles cold, And all the Heavens surrounding him shall seem Like the departing pageants of a Dreamâ When the deep Seas shall leave no trace to tell Where once their haughty Surges joyed to swell; Nay, when the globe whereon they heaved is gone, And Nature's great and glorious task is doneâ Man's everlasting Spirit shall aspire, Through Ages after Ages, higher and higher, New climes of boundless Glory ever try, And revel rich in Immortality! Each thoughtâCreationâgifted with a Dower Not of its ownâbut of Almighty Power; Each hopeâCompletionânay, to Hope no more Stooping in meek dependence as beforeâ Itself its own great Happinessâand Fate Its own great Truthâand Circumstance and State!â My thoughts! my deep and wandering thoughts, be still, Nor dare with such dread grandeur thus to thrill! ON THE PORTRAIT OF LADY ASHLEY. Oh! fairest 'mongst a million fair! With sunny eyes and floating hair, And sylph-like form, and beauteous face, And charm of fascinating grace, And stamp of an exalted line That marks each lineament of thine! Oh! fairest 'mongst a myriad fair! Far more than beauty's boast is there, Or charm of captivating grace, Or pride of a patrician race, There lurks the attractive modesty That deprecates the admiring eye; The ingenuous candour there is seen, That, open, smiling, and serene, For evermore accompanies Sweet Innocence, that scorns disguise: And there, too, above all, appears The gentleness that most endears, That most can win, and most enthrallâ 'Mid thousand graces, first of all! The brightest jewel in the zoneâ The cestus round fair woman thrown! All vestal thoughts, all angel dreams, Illumine thine aspect with their beams, And charms of form, and charms of mind, In thee so sweetly seem combined, That brooding this bright vision o'er, The full heart cannot wish for more. Could ev'n Imagination seize On beauties more divine than these? Eyesâlike the Sun in Morn's young hour, When heightened beautyâsoftened powerâ Make him most Heavenly in the sight, Shining with Love's own golden light; Lipsâthat like bruised pomegranates blush Still with a deep and deepening flush, And brighten with such conquering smiles, That their sweet magic spell beguiles Craft of its weapons and its wilesâ Dull Envy of its stings and sneers, And Sorrow of its rising tears! Rich hairâlike Berenice's own, Which erst unmatchedâunrivalled shone Those clustering locksâthose glistering braids Too precious for these earthly shades, Translated to the glorying skies To dazzle ev'n Immortal eyes! These locks of thine might scarcely yield To those displayed in that proud field! How richly do they stream unbound, In waves of dark luxuriance round, And cast soft shadows o'er the light Of thy fair beauty, else too bright! Most glorious hair! that seems to fall Just loosened from some delicate thrall, In burnished hyacinthine flow, The pillar of thy throat of snow, And shoulder's sculptured grace below: Itself the sole crown for that headâ Unjewelled and ungarlanded; The only mantle that should hide, Those shoulders' alabaster pride! That sole rich veilâwhose folds reveal Beauties that match those they conceal! EnchantmentâOh! enchantment's seen In those fair featuresâthat sweet mienâ Thou fairest 'mongst a myriad fair!â EnchantmentâYea! enchantment's there! And yet, no dangerous Circe thou, With those meek eyesâthat guileless brow. 'Tis the Enchantment pure and true, For ever exquisite and newâ The magic innocent and rare, Which works no spell, and weaves no snare That beautyâwhen 'tis close allied With sacred Virtue's modest prideâ Doth ever blamelessly exert, Over the warm and feeling heart; Then the prompt sentence of the eyes, The judgment seals and ratifies! Oh! fairest 'mongst a myriad fairâ Can pen rehearse the witcheries there? NO MORE! No moreâOh! it must be no moreâ That precious dreaming o'er that precious love! Must, then, such mighty happiness be o'erâ And must my heart wail like a wounded dove No more?âOh! it must be no more! Ne'er shall I know its kindling might again!â That heart-quake of young passion in its power; But faintly droop as flowers beneath the rainâ And die in dreams of that last meeting-hour No more!âOh! it must be no more! And Spring is here, bewilderingly brightâ A laughing world of sunshine and of rose Greets every where the heart, and thought, and sight; But all in vainânought brings me now repose, No more!âOh! it must be no more! Oh! the unburied dreams that haunt my mind; Spring! with thy scent-charged flowers do thou enchain, Nor let me mourn heart-wasted, unresigned, What mourning never can bring back again; No more!âOh! it must be no more! Pastâperishedânowâfor evermoreâand pastâ That costly consciousness of answered love! Let my heart tremble into rest at last, And wear the chains it unsuspecting wove! No more!âOh! hope must be no more! ON THE LOSS OF THE ROTHSAY CASTLE STEAM-BOAT, 1831. Two beautiful sisters were said to have been lost in the Rothsay Castle. Unknownâunclaimedâtossed as with other weeds To silent Earthâand what heart feels or heeds? And yet, perchance, these torn chill ashes were To kindred bosoms exquisitely dear; Perchance! Ah! surelyânever yet on Earth Lived one unloved, uncherished from his birth! No! this pale dust hath once most precious been, In eyes that viewed not life's last phrenzying scene, When the fierce rushing night brought dread and death, Stifling the latest prayer, and latest breath. Now, the cold Sea to the cold Earth returns These reliques wanâo'er which no fond one mourns! The stranger on their stranger lineaments, Casts a sad gaze, and momently laments; Then with a sorrowing mien he turns away, With hurrying steps to leave the unshrouded clay. Yet, stranger! turn again! hast thou ne'er known What 'tis to love a something all thine own? Give to these hapless ones a few meek tears, Lost in the beauty of their golden years; Look on these pale fair formsâthese broken flowersâ Once bright as rose-buds, in Spring's vernal hours; Adopt these desolate orphans of the graveâ Bear them afar from the dull moaning wave; Gather with kind and reverential hands Their sacred ashes from the tide-worn sands; Consign them to some calm unstormy tomb, Where broods a tender and a tearful gloomâ Where breathes no tempest-gust to shake their rest, But south-winds sweep the green sward's flowering breast: Oh! how unlike their death-bedâyon mad seaâ Where all was awe and conquering agony! Where silent stood a doomed and destined throngâ The boldâthe timorousâand the weak and strongâ Ev'n as a sculptured groupe of Deathâto await The last stern signal from the hand of Fateâ Without the shadow of one hopeâwithout Even the chill comfort of one lingering doubt; Yet if high Love and heavenly Faith were there, Thou wert expelledâwert exiledâthence, Despair! If, conscious of the Almighty Presence, still They humbly yielded to the Almighty Willâ And bowed them meekly to the impending ill, And on that anchor and that rock reposed, Which still, to the eye that seeks them, are disclosed; Then the worst bitterness of the opening grave Was taken from the black and boiling wave! If that same Love that tamed the storms of oldâ The Love Almightyâbreathed where thunders rolled, Oh! how the tempests in their hearts were stilled, Though Heaven and Earth with those wild terrors thrilled; Softer than warblings of the mother dove, Pierced through their souls the whisperings of that love; The shock of the Elementsâthe roar of Seasâ Were weak and powerless when compared with these! And surely, Gentlest Sufferersâin your woeâ That consolation's might 'twas yours to know; Yes! we may hopeâye fair and beauteous deadâ Deep blessings o'er your fearful doom were shed; And that 'twas given to ye, when doomed to partâ To dieâsoul linked in soulâand heart to heart With your beloved onesâblessed even thus to share That hour's unmeasurable Hope and Fear! I BORE ON MY BROWS. I bore on my brows a burning wreath Of youth and hope most brightâ And I shrank from the very thought of Death, Of Solitude and Night! Wreathed with the myrtle and the rose, Was the glowing wreath I wore; But there are lovelier things than those, For chastened hearts in store! Thank Heavenâthank Heavenâthat one by one Such earth-born blooms decay! For when they are withered and undone, Spring lovelier things than they! I must crown these brows, sublimely now, With an everlasting wreathâ And wean my thoughts from things below, From Nightâand Earthâand Death! For when of old I fondly deemedâ From these I shrank away; Ah me! I idly, vainly dreamed, And stooped me to their sway! While I but plucked Earth's smiling flowers Of YouthâHope, Love, and Joyâ I held to things, which fleeting hours Can blight and can destroy! But, Oh! thank Heaven! that one by one These flowers have dropped away: Now that their breath and bloom are gone, I dread not Death's sure day! Let me crown my pale and thoughtful brow, With flowers of heavenly breathâ And shrink indeed, and truly nowâ From Earthâand Nightâand Death! Yesâpowerless was the wreath I wore, To battle 'gainst the blight; But now, indeed, in truth, I soar Beyond EarthâDeathâand Night! FALSE WORLD! Oh! World! False world! From thee and thine My hopes are hurled, In swift decline! Farewellâfarewell To grief and glee! No more I dwell With them or thee! My thoughts lie curbed, In calm unchangedâ Still undisturbedâ From strife estranged! To Hope and Fear Farewellâfarewellâ No longer here In soul I dwell. My thoughts are turned To worlds more brightâ For late I mourned, Girt round with night! Oh! World! False World! How dear thou wert! What dreams lie furled Within my heart! Dreamsâthat of yore Were full of might, So streaming o'er With rich delight! Dreams that were all Of thee and thineâ Could these enthral This heart of mine? Thy pompâthy prideâ Thy wealthâthy worthâ And nought beside Thou fleeting Earth! Thy sheenâthy showâ Thy strengthâthy state! (Oh! shame and woeâ These stamped my Fate!) My dreams were full Of these and thee! All else seemed dull And dark to me! The West-Heavens burn With dazzling clouds; But soon these turn To gloomy shrouds. And so, Oh! Earth, Thy charms decay; Thy mightâthy mirthâ So fades away! But clouds that shone O'er Heaven's blue face, Fade one by one, And leave no trace. Once bright of hue, They melt away, Nor more renew Their proud array. Grown dim and cold, They shine no more; Their tale is told, Their time is o'er. But, Oh! no stain They leave behind On Heaven's blue plainâ With Star-fires lined! They leave no traceâ That eye can seeâ But pure their place, And fair and free! World!âthy delights, Ere they depart, With mortal blights Corrupt the heart. Temptations throng Round those who cling With passion strong To each vain thing. Those pompsâthose showsâ Those dreams and joysâ Oft end in woes And dire annoys! And leave behindâ Thus voidâthus vainâ On heart and mind A stampâand stain! Oh! World! how weak Are they who know Alone to seek Thy smiles below! Temptations crowd About their wayâ Too soon they're bowed Beneath such sway! Awhile perchance They sigh and shrinkâ Yet one more glanceâ They smile and sink! Oh! World of Death! I know thee now, Thine icy breath Hath chilled my brow! In time I turn From thee awayâ With strength to spurn Thy false Array. My dreams that burned Like sunset cloudsâ Like them that turned To shadowy shrouds That shrank away, And fading passed, In swift decayâ Not made to last! At least they left No stain to blightâ Of pomp bereftâ And hue and light. But sternly taught, My sobered mind, To leave in Thought Itself behind! To scorn such toys As these now seemâ All Earthly joysâ Each Earthly dream! Those Dreams so bright With rapture's glow, Fraught with Delight Soon changed to Woe! Oh! World of Strife!â I fly thee now!â The Sea of Life Shall peaceful flow! Oh! World of Gloom! From thee I part; One Mighty Tomb In truth thou art! WorldâWorld of Deathâ From thee I fly; To breathe thy breathâ Is but to die! I shunâwho sought Thy Stormsâthy Strife!â And turn my thought To Worlds of Life! FarewellâFarewellâ To good and illâ In peace I dwellâ Resigned and still! LIFE'S BLESSINGS. What are Life's Blessing's?âwhat its best? Oh! not the sunshine of the breast! Not hollow pleasuresâvain delights, But sufferings, sorrows, scorns, and slights!â Life's trials allâits pangs and pains, Its crosses, chastisements, and chains, These are its best of Blessings stillâ These, that beat down the struggling will! That teach the haughty soul to be Girt round with sweet Humility! And Sorrows deep, and cankering Cares, That turn our thoughtless words to prayersâ Frustrated aims and foundered hopes, The mind that grievesâthe heart that droopsâ And disappointmentsâwrongsâand woes. When these bid the awful chasm to close, That yawns Destruction darkly round To those that tread Temptation's ground, Just tottering o'er the abyss profound!â The Chasm of ruin and despair, Which wide awaits the Wanderer there, (If rightly met and meekly borne Those trialsâof their terrors shorn!) Better these Evils thus should fill The dark abyss of ruin still, Than that our Selvesâour Souls should lie Within its dread Profundity! These sorrows and these painsâeven these May Heaven's stern wrath avertâappease. Wiser we may, and better grow, Beneath the infliction and the woe!â A mighty MasterâGrief! thou art, And thou canst cleanse the blackened heart, And purify the mind, and win The Soul from its own darling sin. A mighty MasterâGrief! thou art, And vast thy Schoolâthe Human Heartâ And if thou canst do thus, indeedâ And if through thee the Soul is freed From falsehood and from foolishness, And worldly Vanity's excess, Surely thenâsurely, thou must be (Oh! grant us this deep truth to see) Life's best of blessingsâthough at first Thou seemst its deadliest doom and worst! By thee, to Death we are reconciled, For, oh! if Life for ever smiled Around us, lovely and serene, How could we bear to leave its scene? How would the Heart impassioned cling To every earthly, worldly thing! Oh! what fierce pangs should rack that Heart, When from its treasures doomed to part! But, Grief! by thee we are early soughtâ Thy lessons are the first we are taught; Even the twelvemonths' child, whose brow Is smooth as white unprinted snow, Knows something of thy painful touch, Though gently dost thou deal with such! And as we wend upon our way, We bow yet more unto thy sway, Stronger and stronger grows thy grasp, More dark each tearâmore deep each gasp, Until we sink by thy dim shrine, And all our Soul's great powers are thine! Then do we turn our saddened eyes From this cold World unto the Skies, And cease to fix our foolish trust On Earthâand Earth's frail things of dust, To Heaven with chastened hearts we turnâ With nobler, purer zeal we burn, And leave the paths of Folly's choice, Called by a stillâbut mighty voice. MUSINGS. It is a lovely, lonely, peaceful place, A feature fair on Nature's fairest face; And, oh! how lonely, and how lovely now, Since Evening's shadows, in procession slow, Come dimly onâand Stillness calm and deep, Lies soft in all things, like the dew of sleep. Erewhileâand but a little while ago, So swiftly hours into each other flow, The mirthful song-birds filled the dreamy gloomâ With music that might pierce the impassive tomb; Now not a sound is heardâsave to and fro These green leaves moveâthough sure no breeze doth blow, Soft as some flowery-margined Fountain's flow; As Heaven and Earth breathed faint the breath of life Oh! âhow unlike our Being's restless strife! And nature's beauty is around us here, To thoughtful bosoms ever deeply dear. Natureâwhose glorious Majesty might well Smite the struck heart with more than magic spell; For her triumphant greatness and her power, Beyond Imagination's soarings tower! Her secrets they are countlessâyet behold How much doth knowledge to our ken unfold! Her mysteries they are manifoldâbut still These have been vanquished by victorious will! Man hath pierced through the cloudâand raised the veilâ And feareth not her bulwarks to assail; His eye hath looked upon herâwhere her throne Is placed 'mongst worlds more glorious than his own! Oh! Man! thouâthou hast followedâthou'st pursued Even to her shadowy courts of solitudeâ Majestic nature, by her Lord reviewed! The mighty Mother's secrets thou canst soundâ And plunge into her sea like depths profound; But whatâsave Heaven's stupendous Majestyâ Shall e'er sound thy deep thoughts' all chainless sea?â The Universe it may be thine to scanâ Thyselfâthou'rt the unpierced UniverseâOh! Man! Not all the Sages that have ever sought To extend the Empire of the mind and thoughtâ Nor deep Philosophersânor Schoolsmen shrewdâ Have compassed yetâhowe'er with skill enduedâ That mightiest mystery of themselvesâor shown Whate'er of power or knowledge was their ownâ The deep dark history of one human heartâ A Universe within itselfâapart! This worldâOh! Death! stern Shadowy King! is thineâ To light thy way the glowing sun doth shine; To uphold thy foot, this beauteous Earth doth spreadâ All things are thineâOh! dreary one and dread! Thou hast still mingled with sweet roseate primes, And verdant spring-tidesâall times are thy times; Thou hast still come unbidden to the feast, For every where art thou the silent guest; Where'er man dwells, there hast thou thy abodeâ For thee the Tide of all past Life hath flowed! Yet we must praise theeâthou art strong to draw Our thoughst towards theeâwith interest and with awe! Thou'rt ever strong to interest and to excite, Thy dim perspective points towards boundless light! The Future through the Spirit thou dost pressâ The Futureâmightiest still to curseâor bless! And thou the fountains of our thoughts canst chain To the great mysteries of thy secret reignâ When all we love goes henceâ(our soul's blest careâ Its trust and hopeâbequeathing us despair; For all the communings with rapture fraughtâ The gentle joysâthe luxuries pureâunboughtâ Of hallowed loveâto which Earth's wealth is naught)â How do we turn our longing thoughts to theeâ And seek to dwell in thy stern company! But, Oh! is't not our folly and our fault, If under thy dull shades we choose to halt, To shield us from thy sorrows and thy stingsâ The Almightiest Dove spreads wide His sheltering wings? The Eternity its guiding rays emitsâ The Godhead breathes through thick starred Infinitesâ And our own conscious spirits ceaseless say, âWe yet shall soarâyet break those bonds of clay!â Shall not the Heavenly and the Almightiest Dove Fill us with rapturous faith and trustful love? Shall not the Eternityâwith light Sublimeâ Illume even the intervening wastes of Time? Shall not the glorious Godhead o'er our Souls Shine brightâas where through gladden'd suns it rolls? Shall not our Spirits still reflect its ray, And seek the Life that passeth not away? This worldâstern ruthless Deathâit is not thine! The Rule thou hastâere long must thou resign! A WISH. Where the wonderous and glorious cloud-tracts be, Burning with many a dazzling streak, Would I walk through mists of light with thee, Leaving this Old Worldâblank and bleak. Yet from this dimmest of dim spheres Would I bear some few most precious things, Beloved midst Childhood's smiles and tears, Though tainted now with Life's dark springs. A colour from the empurpled flowerâ A music from the whispering shellâ A sparkle from the rainbowed showerâ A perfume from the blossomed dellâ A verdure from the embowering treesâ A gladness from the glittering waveâ A freshness from the wandering breezeâ A coolness from the o'ershadowing cave! And art thou so beloved thenâEarth? Can links of Life's long chain be dear?â I will not leave theeâPlace of birthâ Even for the loveliest Stranger-sphere! WOMAN AND WOMAN'S LOVE. Oh! Man, through whose imperious, restless soul Stern dreams of grandeur and of empire roll, Still pant ye for Earth's glorious crowns and thrones, Nor heed though thousands' agonizing groans, Distracted curses, and discordant cries, To Heaven in dread appeal tumultuous rise, If proud Ambition prompt, and Fortune grant The fatal aid, 'twere well that you should want!â For this, disfigured is the Earth's fair face, O'erclouded Nature's glory and her graceâ Victory's Volcano shakes the shuddering world, While banners steeped in blood float wide unfurled, Till, haply, sated, sickened at the last With all the gory triumphs of the past, The stormy luxury and fierce joy of War, Ye quit at once th' Earth-desolating Car, And wreak your energies on finer aims, (But still for Earth's vain plaudits and acclaims) And bid Creation once more reassume Its banished brightness and its blighted bloom; Nay, at your word another aspect wear, And shine yet more majestic and more fair! Here peak-y-fronting Pyramids arise, Attesting columns spurn the invaded skiesâ There lift with pride their brazen gates and walls, League-coveringânation-sheltering Capitals!â The laboured Wilderness tamed, vanquished yields, The increase confined before to favoured fieldsâ The stony rock, the rugged and the rude, Smiles with sweet promise, softened and subduedâ Old mountains are deposed, or lower'd, or piercedâ Floods for their bold wild liberties amerced, Pent in and prisoned, and enslaved, and schooled, And by a hand of glorious mastery ruledâ The mighty seas, that thundering shake the shore, Are curbed and straitened in their headlong roar, Where massive breakwaters upreared divide The impatient foaming of the indignant tide! Earth's depths are ransacked for her gems and ores, Her radiant spoils, and her resplendent storesâ Where gloomy forests spread their shadows round, Gay harvests gild the open smiling groundâ The produce of far climes is wafted o'er Unto some alien, uncongenial shoreâ And yet ye do more wond'rous deeds than these, With patient energy and peaceful ease! Lo! mark where Science at her will lays bare The secrets of the Earth and of the Air, The workings of great Nature's mighty heart Detected, pierced, and probed in every part, Even where 'mongst worlds of great and glorious scope She seems to mock his efforts and his hope! Yes! there his triumph and success beholdâ The curtain shrinks uplifted and uprolledâ The cloud is softened and dissolved away, Where Night frowned dark, shine gleams of living Dayâ The mighty Master seems unchecked to move, Obeyed by all around, and all aboveâ World after world, with chrystal walls and gates, At that dread Conqueror's call capitulates!â Lo! how he speeds upon his path of power, Though deepest mysteries o'er his progress lowerâ How doth he toil upon his task of Pride, Nor pause till light is thrown on ev'ry side! Those orbs that through the Heavens majestic roll, Like the great thoughts of an Eternal Soul, Are taught their splendid secrets to revealâ The spell is spokenâshattered is the seal! Upon their radiant and immortal way They are questioned by the ambitious Child of clayâ Their mighty futures and mysterious fates, With fine precision he unerring states; Upon their march of majesty and might, Are theyâthe Thrones of Time and Lords of Lightâ Forestalledâalmost it might appear, foredoomed (Such high authority hath he assumed) By him who walketh for a little while Before their presence, and beneath their smile, Then sinks into his Earth, and all forgets, The Sun that rises, and the Sun that sets; And to his children leaves it to observe If from the paths he prophesied they swerve; But, lo! they swerve notâsteadfast and serene, Mark them fulfil the course he had foreseen! As though these dared not disappoint his dream, Nor mar the glory of his noble scheme; As these dared not dispute and disobey His stern authorityâhis Soul's strong sway; Aye! as they dared not falsify and foil His proud assertion, and defeat his toil! While thus, though far in space' clear depths enshrined, Their destinies are fathomed and devined, And to the gaze of wond'ring eyes exposed, Imperiously devined, and fearlessly disclosed. Yes! Man hath made his empire to extend Proudly and nobly, without bound or end; Still, without faultering, doth he onwards press, To Nature's farthest shrine and last recess. Such are the Victoriesâsuch the works of Mind! Till Thought o'ertaskedâo'erwrought, reels black and blind, Dazzled with too much light (while th' ardent will Would gather Knowledge upon Knowledge still And Might combine with Might, and Skill with Skill,) Till Haughty with that Knowledge and that power, Man's lofty Spirit doth unbending tower, And his high heart elate with triumph grows, As though he gave the laws he dares expose! As though 'twas his to arrange that perfect plan: Tis only his to follow and to scanâ His to establish the Order he evolves, To originate the Scheme he Sounds and solves! Man! still the mastery and the rule maintain, And triumph in your undisputed reign, And still the monarchs and the masters beâ Exult ye in your sway and sovereignty! Be still of this Majestic World the Kings! Extend your rule o'er all terrestrial things Still claim, and keep as your own right from birth, This Empire proud of the Universal Earth! Claim Science, Knowledge, Glory for your own, And hold the Sceptre still, and fill the throne; Receive transcendant Nature's richest feesâ Keep the great Universe's glorious Keysâ The strong Keys of its vast unnumbered wards!â And of Creation reign the undoubted Lords! Weave round your brows the laurel's shining wreath, And sound your Victories with the trumpet's breath; Strict laws on all around ye, still imposeâ While spreads your lofty fameâyour triumph grows!â Unfold majestic mysteries and august, And soar beyond this darkness and this dust! Oh! manâthe ruler and the chief remain, Nor find a rival to your splendid reign; Aye! keep your proud dominion and renown, Preserve the charter and possess the crown! Retain your trophies, and repeat your toils, Grasp your deserved success, and glean your spoils! Keep ye the insignia of your sovereign stateâ The emblems of your great and lofty fate, And all the bold inventions that bestow Your high and dread supremacy below; Still make your own the Sciences and the Arts, Keep, keep your optic tubesâretorts and charts, Your sun-dipped pencils and your flame-tipped pens, The loadstone, and the lever, and the lens; And keep your proud distinctions still your own, Each badge and sign that makes your mastery knownâ Your sceptres, helms, your mitres, palms, and globes, Your truncheons, laurels, scutcheons, crowns, and robes; Your chariots, and your banners, and your swords, Your mighty revenues and dazzling hoards!â Of subjugated Earth remain the lords, And of the conquered elementsâand still Advance from state to state, from skill to skill; Add greatness, unto greatness evermore, And spread your wide command, from shore to shore. Lo! there is oneâa meek one, at your side, To sway, superiorâand too pure for pride; Yet she too claims an empire for her own, A blameless sceptre, and a peaceful throneâ She hath a province and a place apartâ Proud Ruler of the World!âit is thy heart! Ah! doth she envy theeâthy strengthâthy stateâ And strive to be as powerful and as greatâ Thy mightâthy gloryâdoth she seek to share? No!âall she hopesâand all she asksâis there! And let her mourn not o'er a broken Hope, Nor bid her crownless head, dejected droop; But let her wear her own sweet smiles in peace, So shall her gentle joy nor fade nor ceaseâ Leave, leave to Woman her fair myrtle-wreath, Unshadowed by Despair, unscathed by Death; Let every leaf be green, and pure, and bright, Love is the crown that gilds her Soul of Light! She smiles away from her the gauds of power, Nor heeds though dark her changed horizon lower, Though the atmosphere around be fraught with gloom, Though at her feet should yawn the frowning tomb, If Love's dear voice but whisper to her soul, And in her sight he spreads his starry scrollâ Then all is well!âthough suffering, gloom, and care, And all the ills and griefs of life be there. And, oh! the sway, the splendour, and the state, To her can be but as a grief and weight, A sorrow, and a suffering, and a sting, Pain's certain source, and Misery's fertile spring, If unaccompanied, oh! Love, by thee, That still the Angel of her Life must be!â And all is wrong!âand bitterness and care Attend her and become her mournful shareâ 'Twas thus of old the fair Egyptians mourned, Torn from that Land to which they ne'er returned, To be indeed advanced to high estate, To them how dark a woeâhow dire a weight; Bound by their sad alliance, they deplored And languished for the Land so much adored, Desiring but one draught of its sweet stream, Till past their life in that distracted dreamâ Perchance the chosen of their souls remained In that far Home, by Fate's caprice detained, Then all that was in Egypt was beloved, And all abhorred, from its dear soil removed! By the deep Voice of buried feelings called, Till every pulse was thrilled, each power was thralled, They wandered weary on their darkened way, Wailed through the night, and then wept down the day! Around their brows the royal diadem blazed, But, oh! how gladly would they then have raised That cumbrous diadem from the aching brows, Cold, colourless, and cold as wintery snows!â The jewelled mantles round their forms were thrown, How gladly too would they have laid these down, And from their dazzling shoulders have unbound The gorgeous folds that swept resplendent round, Could they have been from those strange shores removed, Once more restored unto the Land they loved! Could they have been by pitying hand set free, And borne back to their Home of Infancy. But this might not be!âand they pined away, And fainter waxed with each succeeding day; They pined on their proud thrones with fevered thoughts, And vainly yearned for the forbidden draughts Of their own distant and divided stream, In that distracted and delirious dream; Full many a strange caprice hath restless grief, And still she seeks on all sides for relief, And dreams, and doubts, and wishes, and believes, And every chance impression still receives; And still retains with fond tenacious hold, And to her will, the stubborn truth would mould; With wild delirious desperation still She grasps those things which ne'er her hopes fulfil! Those things which caused not, nor can cure the ill. Thus did those martyrs of a love-born grief Cling wildly to the fond and vain belief That those sweet draughts could make their anguish less, And soothe their suffering, and console and bless!â Draughts from the old Royal Stream, of whose clear tide They whilom drankâere hope within them died!â That stream they quaffed of yore, when all looked bright, And Earth and Heaven seemed one to their glad sight! In their Heart's sunny times and cloudless yearsâ Their Life's fair rosy seasonsâwhile fond tears Channelled their pallid cheeksâ(by the alien airâ Into no healthful glow, warmed brightly there, But tinted with the hectic flush of care); And burning sighs their gentle bosoms heavedâ By sighs, nor tears, or lightened, or relieved; Even so pined vainly on a foreign strand, The Royal lilies of old Egypt's landâ Captives and victims theyâthough all around Was glad and lovelyâbut no joy they foundâ Whose hearts, not hands, were fettered and were bound; Mocked vainly with the show of Libertyâ They could not seek their dear onesâcould not die! Their gorgeous palaces and cities fair, Might not distract them from their one despairâ Dearer than all to them their cherished chain, And their sole pleasure centred in their pain! And, Oh! how closely were they fettered downâ These weary wearers of the o'erwhelming crown; The winds swept freely through the skies aboveâ The streams did in the joy of freedom moveâ The birds spread joyously their fluttering wingsâ The smile of Freedom lightened o'er all things; But they were bowed beneath an iron reign, And their heart's wreathen fibres wrought their chain; For, Oh! the heart too fondly wooed its care, By one o'erpowering dream still haunted there One dream of love, and passion, and despairâ Its fibres and its pulses evermore, Thrilled to the thoughts, which pierced it to the core: Haunted, o'erwearied, and nor soothed, nor quelled, Till from the seat of Life the fount of Life had welled. Woman must live to loveâor live to mourn For one dear destiny designed and born! The thousand interests and the unnumbered aims, Which each in turn Man's fond attention claims, For her are nothingâraised above them all, She never heeds their claim, nor hears their call For herâLife's noisy changes come and part, And leave a hopeless silence of the heart; Unless Love's voice pierce through them sweet and clear, And then Love's Voice alone 'tis hers to hear! Then is she rousedâand all her soul returnsâ A deep, deep answer, and responsive burns! Still let her gladly through Life's wild scenes move, And crown her with that angel crown of Loveâ That precious diadem of starry light, Yea! let it wreathe her brow for ever bright! Still let it shine unshattered and unstained, From Heaven receivedâfor Heaven be it retained! THE GREEK GIRL'S LAMENT. 'Twas a Greek girlâfar, far from her own land, And like a statue did she speechless stand, Beneath the alienâthe unfamiliar skies Dull to her heart, though beauteous to her eyes. She thought upon her country's plains and hillsâ (Oh! how that thought the exiled Spirit thrills)â She thought upon its gloriesâits disgraceâ Its lofty siresâand its degenerate race! Its beautyâand its brightnessâand its woeâ And the checked tears of grief refused to flow! But thus, at length, from that o'erwearied heart, Gushingly did the deep complainings part! âMy Landâmy beauteous Landâmy loved and lost! Oh radiant clime of battle and of story! Land of the immortal choirâthe unconquered host! Oh! Land of Love, and Poesy, and Glory! âStill doth the Sun, with soft and sacred beams, Shine with a pure and holy lustre o'er theeâ Kindling thy woods, and kissing thy fair streams, As though 'twere moved to pity and to adore thee! âThough Earth forget theeâthou! her pride and boast! The Sun amidst the Heavens still stamps thee fairest! O'er thee his looks of Love are lavished mostâ His glory still in thy decline thou wearest! âStill roll thy rivers, beautiful and brightâ Unchoked by tears, and yet unstained by slaughters! While still the stars of Night's sweet hour weep light O'er these blue breathless tides and burnished waters! âBut I,âthy daughter,âmourn alas, afarâ Nor share thy sorrows nowânor bless thy beautyâ Yet, Oh! mine own sweet Land! nor Sun nor Star Is bound to thee by such dear ties of duty! âBear, bear me hence! here Peace and Freedom reignâ But Peace and Freedom bring to me no pleasure; Oh! Greece! the effort to forget is vainâ Within thy breast is shrined my soul's deep treasure! âBear, bear me hence! a happier lot 'twill be, With thee enduringâand with thee despairingâ Than in strange lands to dwell amongst the freeâ No! let me wear the chain that thou art wearing!â Then died the passion of that strain awayâ And heavy silence on the still air lay! But, Oh! it was the soul's own fervent sighâ Its deep and mournful echoes shall not die! The immortal accents shall be heard aboveâ Truth shall respond to TruthâLove answer Love!</field>
