      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE SEARCH AFTER PROSERPINE AND OTHER POEMS CLASSICAL AND MEDITATIVE THE SEARCH AFTER PROSERPINE. A MASQUE. TO SIR HENRY TAYLOR, K.C.M.G., THIS POEM IS AGAIN DEDICATED BY HIS FRIEND, AUBREY DE VERE. SCENE I. IN SICILY. Ceres, Fountain Nymphs. CERES. 1. Through every region I have sought her; Each shore has answered back my moan. As Summer slides from zone to zone, Winding Earth's beauty in his own, Thus, seeking thee, my long lost daughter, I wander ever, sad and lone. Empty in Heaven my throne remains; Unblest expand my harvest plains. 2. I've searched the deep Sicilian meads, And sacred Latium, where of yore Saturn hid his forehead hoar: I've sought her by the Alphean reeds: Where solitary Cyclops squanders On the unlistening oleanders Vain song that makes the sea-wells quiver, I've sought my child, and seek for ever. 3. By Cretan lawns and vales oak-sprinkled, By sands of Libya, brown and wrinkled, And where for leagues, o'er Nile, is borne The murmur of the yellowing corn, And where o'er Ida's sea-like plain White waving harvests mock the main, Past Taurus, and past Caucasus, Have I been vainly wandering thus; In vain the Heavens my absence mourn, And Iris' self in vain is faint With wafting down their old complaint: O'er earth, unresting though outworn, I roam for aye, a shape forlorn! Hark, hark, they sing— FOUNTAIN NYMPHS. 1. Proserpina was playing In the soft Sicilian clime, 'Mid a thousand damsels maying, All budding to their prime: From their regions azure-blazing The Immortal Concourse gazing Bent down, and sought in vain Another earthly shape so meet with them to reign. 2. The steep blue arch above her, In Jove's own smiles arrayed, Shone mild, and seemed to love her: His steeds Apollo stayed: Soon as the God espied her Nought else he saw beside her, Though in that happy clime A thousand maids were verging to the fulness of their prime. 3. Old venerable Ocean Against the meads uprolled With ever-young emotion His tides of blue and gold: He had called with pomp and pæan From his well-beloved Ægean All billows to one shore, To fawn around her footsteps and in murmurs to adore. 4. Proserpina was playing Sicilian flowers among; Amid the tall flowers straying. Alas! she strayed too long! Sometimes she bent and kissed them, Sometimes her hands caressed them, And sometimes, one by one, She gathered them and tenderly enclosed them in her zone. 5. Lay upon your lips your fingers— Ceres comes, and full of woe; Sad she comes, and often lingers: Well that grief divine I know: Lay upon your lips your fingers; Crush not, as you run, the grass; Let the little bells of glass On the fountain blinking Burst, but ring not till she pass, Down in silence sinking. By the green scarf arching o'er her, By her mantle yellow-pale, By those blue weeds bent before her, Bent as in a gale, Well I know her—hush, descend— Hither her green-tracked footsteps wend. CERES. Fair nymphs! whose music o'er the meadows gliding Hath been your gentle herald, and for me A guide obsequious to this spot—fair nymphs! Fair graceful nymphs, my daughter's sweet companions, Say, say but where she dwells; asking from me, In turn, what boon you will. NYMPHS. Alas, we know not! CERES. May the pure ripple of your founts for ever Leap up, unsoiled, against their verdurous banks; May your fresh kisses ripple up as lightly, As softly, and with undiscovering noise, Against the embowering arms of prisoning lovers, Shadowing those crystal bowers. NYMPHS. We have no lovers. CERES. No, and need none. Alas, Proserpina, Thou wert as these! so innocent no fountain, Nor half so gay; no flower so light, so fair. Ah, fair mild Nymphs, my daughter's sweet companions! May Jove, as ye run by, make blind the eyes Of Wood-gods and the Fauns; in matted ivy Tangle their beards; catch them in sudden clefts Of deep-mossed stems, till ye have glided by— But tell me where she dwells. NYMPHS. Goddess! we know not. CERES. Tell me then how ye lost her. NYMPHS. We were playing, After our caverned sleep, which the high Gods Sent us while Phœbus flamed too near the earth: We played, like summer bees involved, and sang; Some combing pearls from sandy slopes, some blowing In shells, or lily-tubes our watery conchs; When suddenly rolled forth long thunder peals Far, far below. Earth shook; trembling we sank Into our beds, amazed: when up we floated A divine darkness hovered o'er the earth, And from that moment we have had no flowers; No flower since then in flower-famed Sicily! And we no more behold Proserpina, That played with us so sweetly. We have made A melody that tells of her, and sing it, Lest we should grieve. CERES. Yes, I have heard your song. Still the same tale—the words themselves unchanged —Know you no more? NYMPHS. Goddess, not wide our knowledge! Phœbus cares nought for Nymphs, lonely flower-bathers; Nor other prophet see we. Yet of late Our vales are flushed with new strange visitants; Their tumult ofttimes, as the sun descends, Shakes us within our lily-paved pavilions; And when we look abroad along the marge, The inland vales, shaggy with pine and ilex, That catch like nets those boy-nymphs, the light Zephyrs, Are filled with riot. From all sides they rush, Mad Gods, with russet brows the west outfacing, And wands tossed high: in songs the lawns are drowned. Help us, great Jove! Fair Goddess, once it chanced As this red festival came reeling by, Over the fount in which trembling we lay, Some Wood-god crushed a wreath of poisonous berries, Laughing; and our bright home all crimson grew, So that we wept. I pray you, gentle Goddess, Protect us from these Gods. CERES. Ha! Bacchus here! I thought my little late-born enemy Lay hid in Hellas—What, and merry grown, With revellers! then haply he hath stolen My beauteous child. Mild nymphs, my child's companions! Mild, silver-footed nymphs with silver songs! Where dwell those Wood-gods when they come not hither? NYMPHS. At Naxos, Fame reports; and unblessed isle. CERES. Farewell, sweet nymphs—from them, and from all perils May Jove defend you well! I seek those Gods, And I will pray them that they hurt you not. NYMPHS. First Semichorus. Without aid of plumes Light-footing the sea brine, The dimness she illumes Of evening's gray decline; The wild streams, proud to waft her, In dappled purple glide, With a shadowed green track after, And a sunny green beside. Second Semichorus. Down, nymphs, into the waters! The air is dense with sighs, The earth is red with slaughters; Down, down, and seldom rise! Our crystal dome above us, And the star-dome yet more high, Nor care nor pain can move us While here we laugh and lie! SCENE II. NAXOS. Ceres, Wood-gods. CERES. A Bacchic wood! the pine stems and old oaks Are swathed with crimson under their green shadows! A wilderness of wood! within its depths Armies of men might lurk. Above the trees A gloom voluptuous undulates and hovers Like a dark fleece of wind-dewed gossamer. The caverns, as I pass them, mildly breathe A colder current of wine-scented air Into my face. Ha, ha,—a tiger's roar! And now a din of resonant wild laughter That makes the forest like a reed-pipe ring. The very beasts have caught the infectious madness, And ramp, with sport irreverent, on high Gods. Down, leopard, down—ha, myriad-mooned panther, Away! 'tis well for you this almond branch Is sheathed in flowers Sicilia feeds no more; That cry had else been louder. Hark, they come! FAUNS AND WOOD-GODS. First Strophe. Hold, hold the vine-wreathed goblet up, Where lies the fierce wine darkling; Now Bacchus leaps from out the cup: See, see his black eyes sparkling! Hark, how the bubbles upward throw A low song and soft coiling; 'Tis Bacchus' self that laughs below, To keep his red fount boiling! First Antistrophe. Great Bacchus with his conquering hands Upraised the far-sought treasure Of all the oceans, all the lands, Afloat in one wild pleasure. Lo! how it plunges, rolls, and sweeps! Great Bacchus bathes beneath it; What odour from the eddy leaps! Great Bacchus' self doth breathe it. Second Strophe. Through us he rises from the ground; These sharp-leaved chaplets draw him Into our tresses ivy-crowned: In purple flames I saw him! Lift every thyrsus high and higher; While round and round ye wind them, Great Bacchus turns the air to fire, Wide crowns of fire behind them! Second Antistrophe. Drink, drink to Bacchus, every limb With wine will soon be glowing: He drinks to those who drink to him, Himself on all bestowing. Into the hearts of all his wards He pours, like streams from Pindus, The strength and speed of all the pards That rolled his car by Indus! CERES. O Fauns and Satyrs of the merry forests! Sharp-hoofed, long-horned, nymph-dreaded deities! Grant me this hour your aid! Secrets I know Of herbs grass-hidden and medicinal blooms Whereof one leaf, into your cups distilled, Would make them rise into a fount of foam Wide as the broad arch of yon flowering myrtle: Those secrets shall be yours—only restore me My infant child. FAUNS. O venerable Goddess! Large-browed, large-eyed, presence august and holy! In our green forests dwells no infant child. CERES. But she is now in truth no infant child As when I laid her 'mid the sacred flowers Of Sicily, with Nymphs for her young nurses And tender playmates. FAUNS. Venerable Goddess! No child have we beheld, nor ever shall, With mien like thine. CERES. Ah! she was not like me! I was her mother; but like her no more Than the dark ground is like some flower star-bright, That from it springs, and o'er it waves in beauty! FAUNS. In Sicily you lost her? CERES. Wood-gods, yes. FIRST FAUN. And I remember now in that soft isle Such creature we beheld as you have lost, Upon a vernal bank she sat alone Among the aërial mounds and honeyed meadows; Wearied she seemed, yet smiled in weariness, And, as a garden, was with bright flowers crowned; Many she held upon her lap, and many Fell down about her feet; her feet gleamed through them. Strange fear, albeit to fear unused, we felt, And, beckoning to each other, slow retired. Since then in vain we seek her. CERES. Woodland Gods! Was she not fair? SECOND FAUN. So fair that on the earth Is left no longer any shape of beauty. Well spake you, calling her your infant child. Such light was on her brow—within her eyes Such gleam immediate of celestial gladness, A child she seemed, by that inspiring clime Divinely ripened in one summer day To full perfection of virginal beauty. Not far the playmate nymphs their wild hymns sang, Like birds new-touched by the enamouring season: While we went back, dreading the wrath of Jove. CERES. Since she is lost those songs are heard no more. In vain the sea-worn mariners suspend Long time their oars amid the drifting spray; In vain the home-bound shepherds pause and listen; Nor any flower is seen. FAUNS. Maternal Goddess! Still in one spot lingers a wreath of flowers. CERES. 'Tis strange—those flowers, where are they? FAUNS. At the entrance Of a long glen, that sinks in dimness down From the proud pastures arched along the sea. CERES. Ha, Woodland Gods! that was her place of play; A haunt unknown to men. FAUNS. Hark, hark, 'tis Bacchus! CERES. But tell me, Gods— FAUNS. We thirst, we thirst for wine; Give, give us wine, and we will stay with you; Roll it in deep floods forth, from cleft and cavern. CERES. Stay, Wood-gods, stay! FAUNS. Ha, ha, that laugh; 'tis Bacchus! (They rush past singing.) First Strophe. Hour by hour the vines are growing Over pine and over rock, The blood, like fire within them flowing, With bounding pulse and merry shock Each light bough uplifts and pushes Till the loftiest ridge it brushes. First Antistrophe. Hour by hour great Bacchus nurses The wide wreaths of his anadem; In him they meet, and he disperses Himself o'er all the world in them: The mountains of all seas and lands, He grasps them in his thousand hands. Second Strophe. The gums from yonder pine-boughs dropping Like fire-lit jewels darkly shine; The ivy-wreaths yon goat is cropping Are drenched in mist of purple wine. The Vine, a honey-venomed snake, Hath bit and swollen each brier and brake. Second Antistrophe. The forest burgeons giant-flowers As on this generous food it feeds; Warming its roots in crimson showers That bead the earth with Bacchic seeds: A sacred wood: his house of mirth The God that conquers all the earth! Epode. The carpets of those halls of joyaunce Uplift us with so fierce a spring, That we, to balance that upbuoyaunce, Deep draught on draught are forced to fling. Hark, hark, his laugh! we cannot stay; Blue skies, farewell! away, away! CERES. To Sicily once more. Lo! how these vines Have grown about me! never infant yet Tangled like this young Bacchus his embraces; Not one upon the earth! another year, And half my kingdom he'll have won from me As Hermes robbed Apollo of his herd. No feastful, sunlit mound, or yellow hill, Will sing, at evening, anthems unto me; No shelving corn-field on the mountain-slope Make westering Phœbus, while askance he peers Down through the pale stems, green with jealousy. Parnassian weed, away! ah, lost Proserpina! Thou, thou wert as my flowers—unsought for mine, And then, once mine, more dear than all my wealth! The Gods, in their Olympian mansions, know Nothing of grief: children they too have lost; But never mourned as I have. Surely I Have caught from Earth some portion of her sadness, And heart maternal of Humanity. To Sicily once more. O fair Sicilia! Those flowers they saw, whence came they, and what mean they? That must my search discover; I must see them; When I behold them I shall see once more What I in vain desire—my child's fair eyes. Down, vine-wreaths, down! I break from you away. SCENE III. SICILIAN SEA. (Nereids sing.) Strophe. Far off the storms were dying; The Sea-nymphs and Sea-gods On new-lulled billows lying, With tridents and pearl-rods: Upon their sliding thrones And beds of waving waters Reclined august, old Ocean's sons, And the choir of his foam-white daughters. Antistrophe. Into their deep conchs blowing, They smoothed the scowling waves, And the great sea-music forth flowing Was echoed in glassy caves. There was no sound but song Save now and then far under, When an ocean monster streamed along With a roll of Ocean's thunder. Epode. Then Iris, lightly dropping, Leaped from her cloudy screen, And lit on a wave down-sloping In floods of crimson-green: A moment its neck she trod, And cried, ‘The Gods of Heaven Are coming to feast with the Ocean-God, So Jove has sworn, this even.’ GLAUCE. Fair Sisters, ocean-cradled, wave-revered! Holds not this evening well the morning's pledge? Salt gust no more; nor airy arc, down-showering Into the dim green, rain of sunny gems Or crowns celestial; crystal chasm no more By harsh winds crushed to murmuring foam abysses; But, wide o'er all, a plenitude of light Serene as that which sits on Jove's great brow; And breeze as equable as Juno's breath. AUTONOE. And, Sisters, mark! along yon opal Heaven, And sea of agate and chalcedony The promised pageant spreads. We shall behold The mighty head of Jove, rich-tressed, supreme, Sacred and strong and fair and venerable, With golden sceptre and obedient eagle: And we shall gaze on Juno's large mild eyes, And the sea-born Queen of Beauty, her who runs Over the swelling hearts of Gods and men As Thetis glides over the ocean waves; And, dearer still to us, the graceful form Of Hebe, solitary nymph of Heaven, Alone among the Gods and yet not lonely. Thus Iris spake. EUDORA. Fair Iris! dropped she then This morn from Heaven, her ocean spoils to gather? I knew it not, for on the Libyan sands All day I rolled a great smooth shell, too great To clasp or carry: but my tears are past, Since we shall gaze upon high Gods. GLAUCE. Lo, there! How the red west inflames the deep! Methinks That merry God, conqueror of many a land, His banners over ocean too is waving; To Britain will he drive us, end of earth? See, I have dropped my bracelet! AUTONOE. Over ocean That God advances; dark-rimmed Naxian shores Already with his tendril nets are swathed, Yea and the Naxian billows; all day long We toss them backward from our foam-white bosoms, And beds of billows, to their beds of sand. EUDORA. And maids of earth he mocks at worse than us. Last eve, by yonder meadow I was floating, Pillowing my cheek upon a sleepy wave, And hearkening to an inland pipe remote, When suddenly the purpled shore resounded With tumult harsh; and concourse I beheld Of Wood-gods on the sands, leaping and laughing! And why? because a gentle maid of earth That with her mortal playmate had been straying, Beneath the bank, oppressed perhaps with sleep, (Who knows? I know not), when she thought not of it, In vine-nets prisoned lay: The Wood-gods mocked! Bacchus such puissance hath— GLAUCE. How wretched those That dwell on Earth! alas, I pity them! On that rough, heavy, element opaque What lovely light can glimmer? None can tell Wherefore the high Gods shaped the hump-backed Earth! EUDORA. Nay, Sister, when the forests slant as now From the round mountains to the wine-black sea, And Phœbus on their gold and vermeil roof Looks brightly, while the winds rush under them, Then hath the Earth her beauty—yea, a gleam Like our Autonoe, when her sun-loved tresses Upon a green rock loosening she flings forth, Laughing, into some monster's briny eyes. AUTONOE. You speak well, Sister, courteous like the Gods; And blossoming fruit-trees, spangled with sea spray, Are fair indeed at sunrise: Earth hath gleams, As Nubian slaves their gems; yet how forlorn And like a slave's her downcast countenance! Her hues are not like ocean's, coloured lights, But coloured shades, dim shadows painted o'er; Yea and the motions of her trees and harvests Resemble those of slaves, reluctant, slow, By outward force compelled; not like our billows, Springing elastic in impetuous joy, Or indolently swayed. EUDORA. Not less o'erawed Are those that dwell on Earth, harsh-speaking Mortals. One eve, it chanced, into a glen I wandered, In garb a boy: unwonted weight I felt; The shades moved not; dull odours thronged the air; Up from the ground a dense, blunt sound was rushing; All creatures ranged, as though beneath their feet Down to earth's centre chains unseen were hung, And languid browsed as from necessity, Not joy, their faint sighs leaving on the grass. All things were sad; sadly I wandered on To where there lay a something large and black, And panting; some Immortal deeming it, With reverence I was passing, when, behold! Hard by there stood a company of Mortals, Wailing; and myrrh on myrrh, and oil on oil, O'er it in grief they flung; it was a pyre. Homeward I turned abashed, and weeping much For Man's unhappy race, so fair, yet sad, By Jove's great wrath oppressed and shame of death. Yes, and weep still; for know you, gentle Sisters, Though Gods themselves should dwell upon the Earth, Grief they must feel; the affliction men call love, Or hunger, or the grave. AUTONOE. Down, Sisters, down! In sorrow footing the bright ocean-way I see that form half human, all divine: 'Tis Ceres; plunge we down! No nymph she loves Save her child's mates. GLAUCE. Yea, and of those is jealous. SCENE IV. THE SICILIAN SHORE. Ceres, Fountain Nymphs. CERES. Inconstant waves, farewell: I love you not: Earth, I salute thee, fruitful, though in sorrow. Still on! my search, though vain, is all my rest. One flower of hers, to this sad bosom folded, Will give it back its old Olympian calm. The nymphs sing low: O for thy songs, Proserpine, That woke the ice-bound streams, while old boughs leaped, Though dead, into the glory of fresh blossoms! (Fountain Nymphs sing.) 1 Proserpina was lying Against her ebon throne; Alternating long sighing With a shudder and a moan: The dull Lethean river, Whose breath the nightshade breeds, Went toiling on for ever Through the forest of its reeds: ‘O mother, I was playing 'Mid the soft Sicilian air— Forever must I languish In this empire of Despair!’ 2 With wide and sable gleaming, In chains decreed of old, Through gray morasses streaming, That ancient river rolled: The hemlock borders under Drave the voluminous flood, With a low, soft, sleepy thunder That thrilled the stagnant blood: ‘O mother, I was playing 'Mid the soft Sicilian air— Forever must I languish In this empire of Despair!’ 3 No bird was there to warble, The wind was void of sound; Vast caves of jet-black marble Were yawning all around; No placid Heaven, blue-tented, Its dome above her spread; Like clouds the Souls tormented Were drifting overhead: ‘O mother I was playing 'Mid the soft Sicilian air— Forever must I languish In this empire of Despair!’ 4 Darkness but faintly chequered Possessed that region dim, Save one white cloud that flickered Above the horizon's rim; Under the dreary lustre It cast in flakes and showers Up rose afar the cluster Of Pluto's palace towers: ‘O mother, I was playing 'Mid the soft Sicilian air— Forever must I languish In this empire of Despair!’ 5 Proserpina for ever Thereon her large eyes kept, While gusts from that cold river Her tresses backward swept; Ever in sadness lying Against her ebon throne, With her melancholy sighing Half smothered in a moan: ‘O mother, I was playing 'Mid the soft Sicilian air— Must I languish here forever In this empire of Despair!’ CERES. O Nymphs, where found you that despondent song? And why this funeral chime? She is immortal. NYMPHS. Immortal truly, venerable Goddess! And yet in Erebus she dwells; and plays No more; no flowers to play with finds she there. CERES. How know you this? NYMPHS. Last eve we wandered forth, By fugitive rainbows lured and rain-washed grass, To that deep valley where we lost our playmate; And for the first time past it. In one spot We found, with joy astonished, crowds of flowers; Flowers of all kinds, each larger than its kind, And brighter; wandering here and there among them, Behold two mighty chariot tracks! deep fissures, Burning and black, to where the opposing bank Locked in and barred the vale: the rocks were split; Dull vapours hovering o'er them. In a moment The truth flashed on us, and we heard, yea felt Once more, that subterraneous thunder roll. The King of Darkness, Monarch sole below, Looked up and saw thy child, and thirsted for her; And snatched her to his shades:—In Erebus Thy daughter dwells. CERES. No song, no fable this! Ah flower! pure lily among the unfruitful shades! White lonely lamp of all the Elysian darkness! Ah child! the daughter of an unblest fate, Thou hast no Mother now: thou hast forgotten That e'er thou hadst a Mother—Woe, woe, woe! The imperial diadem doth mock that brow, The sceptre doth subdue that little hand More than the Shades, thy subjects! Gentle Nymphs, Let me behold that spot. FIRST NYMPH. With slow, sad foot (On gray autumnal eves, the Nymphs themselves With slow, sad foot, o'er the dim grass steal on) Advance; no bounding step, fair sister Nymphs; No bounding step, or jubilant, reckless song. Lo, there the gleam! a breeze, a sigh divine Is ever sweeping o'er those tremulous flowers! Troubling their dews that fall not, held, like tears In melancholy eyes—O fair, fair flowers! Ye, as she dropped you, instantly took root, And fade not ever. Immortality Ye caught from the last pressure of those hands; Immortal were ye though the world should die. NYMPHS. First Semichorus. Looks divine, divinely chastened, Sad eyes, on the saddened ground As by spells eternal fastened, Folded hands, and locks unbound! Deeper, every moment deeper, Pierce those eyes her daughter's shroud; The earth to this immortal weeper Grows half transparent as a cloud; And her ears even now are ringing With old Lethe's mournful singing. Second Semichorus. But see, on high the blue is riven! That radiance! Hermes it must be! Around him smiles the flattered Heaven; No Apollonian flight hath he Right onward, nor the stormy wrath On Jove's great Eagle earthward rushing, But winds along in serpent path Through maiden airs around him flushing, With wingèd feet and rod upholden, Enwreathed with mild Persuasions golden. HERMES. Hermes, mild herald of the Gods, I come, Bearing the grace of Jove, upon my lips Distilled—high kiss of heavenly benediction. Goddess to Mortals and Immortals dear, Be of good cheer: Proserpina, beloved Of all the blest Olympians, sceptred sits In Tartarus; sole pride of him that sways The world heroic of Departed Souls; A child although a Queen; and, though a spouse, Yet virgin ever; tempering the deep heart Of Pluto, and to all the Shades as dear As Dian to the night, or to the waves The foam-dividing star of Aphrodite. Sacred and well beloved—a Mystery— Fares she not well? Maternal Goddess! raise The large dejected orbs of thy fair eyes, And gaze on him upon whose brow doth meet The light of all the Gods giving command: Look up and speak! CERES. Mild herald Mercury! Thy voice is in mine ears; winged and sweet Ever its tones; brightening all hearts, like Heaven When Jove looks up: but now, unwonted softness Melts through their pauses. Dost thou pity me? Then herald God, auspicious guide of Shades, Mighty art thou in the Unbeloved Abode; Restore, restore my child! HERMES. Not comfort only, Deep-bosomed Goddess, grave, and dulcet-voiced, But aid I bear: and need there is of both. Alone she sits beyond the utmost bound Of laughter from the Gods, or shaft Phœbean, And thou art justly restless for thine own. Hear then the ordinance of Jove; descend! Yon rock shall like a billow arch thy way; Descend into the Stygian waste; behold Once more thy tender daughter face to face; Kiss her once more, once more upon thy knee And in thine arms possess her. This is much: Yet more: if seed not yet of flower or fruit Unblessed have touched her lips, henceforth and ever With thee she dwells in sweet society. Descend! the Will of Jove, before thee running, Makes smooth thy path, and the Caducean charm Waved from this wand, around thy feet shall beckon A quire of bright Immortals fit to grace The steps of a departing Deity. Ethereal Seasons! from the snowy clouds, Your ambient nests on cold autumnal days, Hover once more about this spot; and ye Gift-feathered Hours, at Heaven's wide gate for ever On broad and billowy wing suspense, the cord Aerial, that detains you, bursting, fly With unreverting faces to the earth, And breathe a sudden spring on valley and plain: And ye, infantine Zephyrs, on whose lips The Gods have breathed; thou too, delight of Heaven, Iris! descend; and o'er the shadowy glen Thy many-coloured scarf from both thy hands Fling wide, and cast the brightest of thy smiles Upon the head of this descending Power. FIRST NYMPH. Behold! into the chasm she walks. SECOND NYMPH. But lo! How rich a splendour burns on yonder bank! The trees grow lustrous as Apollo's locks; Between the arch of yon suspended bow And the green hollow, flows a low deep music, With light songs o'er it playing in wantonness: Hark, hark, once more. (The Hours sing.) Strophe. A beam on Earth's chill bosom Falls pointed 'mid her sleep; And leaf and bud and blossom Up from their dull trance leap: That beam at Earth's dim centre Hath found the mailèd Winter, And touched his snow-cold lips; Upon his breast that beam doth rest And frost-bound finger tips. Antistrophe. From deep grass gently heaving Quick flowers in myriads rise, A wreath for Winter weaving; It falls below his eyes! His old gray beard it covers Like locks of mirthful lovers; It makes him laugh with pride, As he a youth had grown in sooth And found a youthful Bride. (The Zephyrs sing.) Strophe. The bright-lipped waters troubling Of the pure Olympian springs, We caught the airs up-bubbling, And stayed them with our wings; From the beginning sealed Like sweet thoughts unrevealed Those airs till then lay hid; Like odours barred in buds yet hard Or the eye beneath the lid. Antistrophe. Our pinions mildly swaying With an undulating grace We bid those airs go playing Over Earth's beaming face: On the laurel banks new-flowered, On the ridge of pine dew-showered, On every leaf and blade That leaps on wings and all but sings In sunshine or in shade! (Hours and Zephyrs sing together.) Strophe. Over the olives hovering, Brushing the myrtle bowers, Dark ground with blossoms covering, The Zephyrs and the Hours, With laugh and gentle mocking We play, the green boughs rocking, Above each other rolled From laurel leaf to laurel leaf, That sing like tongues of gold! Antistrophe. Now like birds fast flitting On from bough to bough, Like bees in sunshine knitting Murmuring mazes now: Parting oft—oft blending And for ever sending Spangled showers around, With eddying streams of scents and gleams, And deep Olympian sound. (Sicilian Nymphs singing.) First Strophe. Numbers softer than our own And in happier circle running Like Flora's crown or Venus' zone They are braiding in their cunning. All the God-througed air is glowing With a ferment of delight, All the flowers in rapture blowing Every moment swell more bright, And higher round the pale stems clamber In vermilion wreaths or amber. First Antistrophe. Half in terror, half in pleasure, Little birds on warm boughs waking Launch abroad a rival measure, Floral births with songs o'ertaking: O'er the shadows little lights, And o'er little lights a shadow Bound along like gamesome sprites On the green waves of the meadow; And new streams are up and boiling, And new insects round them coiling. Second Strophe. On one side a cedarn alley, On the other a myrrh brake, Downward streams the mystic valley, As flushed rivers their path take By hills their devious waters curbing; Airs ambrosial forth are swung From boughs their crimson fruitage orbing Iris, borne those airs among, Flings o'er the dim wildernesses Her illumed dishevelled tresses. Second Antistrophe. Through a mist of sunny rays Gleam bright eyes and pinions shiver; O'er the mountain's breast of bays Panting dew-gems bask and quiver; All the Gods with silent greeting In this sumptuous harbour met Make the palace of their meeting Rich as Juno's cabinet, Golden-domed and golden-gated, With sacred pleasures never sated. Hush—wild song, no more! Nor dance of lyric lightness— A shadow from the shore Steals, and blots the brightness. Like children tired of play The splendours melt away: Trips by each elf—mark! Iris' self Dissolves in waning whiteness. IRIS. I have but leaped from out my airy lustres To plant my white foot palpably on Earth. Fair nymphs, this shadow soon, too soon, will reach The front now bright of that descended Goddess. Her lost one she hath found—alas, too late: Seeds of a Stygian fruit have passed her lips! Three fatal seeds! Proserpina hath sucked Into her being the dark element. And yet lament not! Ceres' self shall learn Comfort and divine solace from her child, What the Gods could not give, her child, though sad, Yet fraught with sweetness of Elysian wisdom, Bestows upon the Mother. From this hour Let every mortal Mother that hath given A child from her own heart into the Shades, Live and take comfort; they shall meet again. Let every mourner in the Past who buries An innocent delight, be sure henceforth That in the Future, a large treasure-house, It doth await him. Gentle Nymphs, weep not; Those parted lips, those smooth and candid brows Were not for mourners fashioned, sigh or shadow, But for pure breathing of celestial airs, And gracing a light garland. NYMPHS. Mild-eyed Goddess! Must we no more behold Proserpina? Must flower-famed Sicily have no more flowers? IRIS. I see the end, and therefore I am glad; I, that look down into the smallest dewdrop, Yet in my bright arch clasp the end of all: And, whether I descend, the adorned cradle Of some young flower to rock, or fatally To cut the locks of some expiring King, My task is kind, and Comforter my name. Fear nought; Proserpina shall rise once more; For Jove is clement, and a Mother's prayers Ofttimes of fateful power against the Fates. One half the year in darkness dwells she throned, A Queen; one half she plays, a child on Earth, Flower-crowned, and constant 'mid inconstancy, Whether Narcissus now, or Daffodil Her choice persuade; or mysteries in the cups Of Cowslips through thick honey scarce espied, Or Primroses moon-lighted all day long, Or fabled Pansy, or Anemone Wind-chidden, or the red all-conquering Rose, Enchain her youthful heart—or other flowers, Named on the Earth but nameless still in Heaven, Subdue her, each in turn or all at once. Mild Nymphs, farewell! To Juno, large-eyed Queen, Whose Herald fair I boast myself, once more I speed (Nymphs descend, singing.) Strophe. Proserpina once more Will come to us a-Maying; Sicilian meadows o'er Low-singing and light-playing. The wintry durance past, Delight will come at last: Proserpina will come to us— Will come to us a-Maying. Antistrophe. Sullen skies to-day, Sunny skies to-morrow; November steals from May, And May from her doth borrow; Griefs—Joys—in Time's strange dance Interchangeably advance; The sweetest joys that come to us Come sweeter for past sorrow. RECOLLECTIONS OF GREECE, AND OTHER POEMS. To the Memory OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR THESE RECOLLECTIONS OF GREECE ARE DEDICATED. STANZAS WRITTEN WHILE SAILING DOWN THE ADRIATIC. 1 By many an isle and forest peak In darker purple gushing The Adrian eddies stream and break, And our light boat is rushing. Warm airs from under a full moon Against our foreheads pant, And fan each bright and blue lagoon Warm airs from the Levant. 2 Our bark runs down the watery slope With tremulous sail out-blown, Like Love down banks half-flowered, or Hope Warbling o'er fields new-sown. Eager as youth or vernal prime, As swift as darting swallows, The omens of a milder clime She scents far off, and follows! 3 Ausonia yet stern Winter sways: But Spring thus far hath flung Her breath before her on the ways Her feet shall tread ere long. Even now vague smells of promised bowers Float feebly o'er the shoals— Thus softly float o'er Lethe's flowers The body-waiting souls. 4 Great Dian mocks her brother's beams With light as wide though colder: Not from her brow alone it streams, But half her breast and shoulder! Old Ocean laughs in dream, or wakes In smiles to meet her glance; No rock so dun but shines and shakes Beneath her silver lance. 5 On, winged bark, into the South! If other breeze were none, This music freshening from my mouth Alone might waft thee on! On, wild Swan, to the realms of light! Though all thy plumes were rent, Our rushing souls might wing thy flight Into the Orient! A NIGHT AT CORCYRA. 1 A hoary gleam through boughs prevailing Tells me how near the ocean lies, Here caged in many a waveless lake By cypressed ridge and shadowy brake: Far off the Nightingale is wailing: More near the watery grot replies. 2 The forest growths are rocked and dandled By airs with midnight odours faint, Soft, separate airs, o'er feather'd grass That pass me often and repass, Like naked feet of Nymphs unsandalled That tread cach lawn and alley quaint. 3 No voice is heard of mortal creature! No voice—yet I am not alone: Nausicaa and her virgin train Still haunt the woodland, skirt the main, And deck for me with human feature Each glimmering branch and white-browed stone. 4 When with those Maids the Exile Ulysses. sported, The fire-flies lit, as now, the glen: That rose its blush to-day which gave And bosom to the aspiring wave, Descends from one old Ocean courted, On the same cliff it may be, then! 5 I see not now those hills whose summits In August keep their ermined robes; But feel their freshness—know that round They gird the steely gulfs profound With feet that mock the seamen's plummets, And foreheads crowned with starry globes. 6 But see! vast beams divide the heaven; The orange-groves their blossoms show; Over yon kindling deep the moon Will lash her snowy coursers soon: Now, by her brow the East is riven! And now the West returns the glow! GRECIAN ODE. 1 Yes, yes, 'tis Greece! full many a fane Around me gleams, as white As when it gladdened cape or plain The first time with its light; And living choirs, far-eyed and virgin, Once more through Time's old shade emerging, With dew-brushed sandal and soft sound Salute the dedicated ground. 2 Each hill of asphodel and bays Sufficient deems its height If steep enough its arch to raise A temple into light. From cape to cape, across the deep The ‘wingèd Pines’ in panic sweep— Among their forest-sires so ran Shy wood-nymphs in the days of Pan! 3 In every bay the yearning billows Swell up, as proud as when White Nereids slid from purple pillows Under old Homer's ken. Above them still the Acacia throws The warm shower of her sun-touched snows Profusely as when Zephyr first Deflowered the blooms himself had nursed. 4 Those theatres the white cliffs gird, Those hollows grey and wide, With tamarisk feathered, and moss-furred, Those blue rifts far descried, Those sinuous streams that blushing wander Through labyrinthine oleander, Those crocus mounds, that wind-flower hill— Hail ancient land! 'tis Hellas still! 5 Range beyond range the mountains rise; Smooth platform, and meet stage If demi-gods for chariot prize Fraternal strife should wage. Glad clouds are launched along the wind, As though each snowy tent enshrined Olympian choirs borne lightly by With sound of spheral melody. 6 Beheld that goat yon rift beneath, Eyeing those rocks pine-cloven! Nor lacks yon mound its living wreath Of goatherds dance-inwoven, Now measuring forth with Attic grace (Like figures round a sculptured vase) The accent of some mythic song, Now hurled, a Bacchic group, along. 7 That old man 'neath the Palm who sits Trolls loud a merry lay: Round him as genial fancy flits As when his month was May. Still from the nectared air he quaffs As happy health, as gaily laughs As when he clomb yon breeze-swept hill, And see, those maidens fly him still! 8 Yon mighty Ilex vast and grave Flings far its restless shadow; But through its trunk, a windowed cave, Long lights divide the meadow: Its roots all round like serpents creep. And honey-dews its branches steep, Thus beamed Dodona's oak afar Fawn-haunted and oracular. 9 What vale was that wherein the Nine Were used with Harmony to play? Between the Juniper and Vine They roam each vale to-day! What stream was that o'er which, flower-wreathed, Her passion Aphrodité breathed? Each lilied bank that stays each rill From that wild breath is quivering still! 10 Yon children chasing the wild bees Have lips as full and fair As Plato had, or Sophocles, When bees sought honey there. But song of bard or sage's lore Those fields ennoble now no more: It is not Greece—it must not be— And yet, look up—the land is free! 11 I gazed round Marathon. The plain In peaceful sunshine slept: Eternal Sabbath there her reign Inviolably kept: Is this the battle-field? I cried— An Eagle from on high replied With shade far cast and clangour shrill ‘Yes, yes— 'tis Hellas, Hellas still!’ ODE TO THE PLANET MERCURY. 1 In these dull, proud days Few how few there be Songs or eyes that raise, Star of Joy, to thee! Profane, our hearts we spend On earthly loves and wars; Or kindle factory fires, far-kenned With beam as red as Mars. 2 Not now the Poets soar To Heaven, or tempt the seas: On clouds and trees they pore; Or men, dim-seen ‘like trees,’ Through melting mists that loom Of metaphysic dreams;— Or bend in apathetic gloom Over Lethean streams. 3 Too fierce delights will come unbidden! (Io Pæan, Io sing) Too leaden thoughts are wisely chidden— Such moods let Saturn bring. Mirth is thine, and witching words That thrill, not jar, our lute-strung hearts; Devices sweet, and jocund chords, And art of life—the art of arts! 4 O'er the woodland promontory I beheld thee rise alone, Car divine, and Youth whose glory Lit that argent throne. Wingèd Helm I knew, and eyes Smiling glance with glance pursuing— They shine, not flash, with sweet surprise Winning Earth ere wooing! 5 Lo! that keen, exulting gladness (Spite of Phœbus, Io sing) Pierces all the heart of sadness With bright, heavenly sting: And preaches, he is wiser-witted Who plays the wanton knave in jest, Than those who live of joy self-cheated, By false cares depressed. 6 Hermes to his cavern hollow (Io Pæan, Io sing) Lured the bright herd of Apollo, And mocked the Delphic King, As, bending his great brow, he pondered Why the Babe this feat had done: From maze to maze the Augur wandered, Nor guessed that—cause was none. 7 New-born he slipped through bowers of myrtle (Io Pæan, Io sing), And, circumventing, scooped a turtle, And wrought with bridge and string. O teach our kind, those wanderers slow Who toil life's weary waste along, Each clod of earth, thus touched, would grow A fount of gladsome song! 8 Jove's great sceptre thou hadst stolen: (Io Pæan, Io sing) With clouds the brow supreme was swollen, Ruffled the Eagle's wing: But thy winking shot bright weather All the Olympian tempest round: The grave-faced Eagle laughed: the Father Thy locks with both hands crowned! 9 Mocked hast thou the breast of Pallas With a love-shaft from thy lyre: In self-despite the maids of Hellas Felt thy fraudful fire. Thee that monster triple-headed, Couched in darkness, doth revere: Souls on Stygian billows bedded Leap thy lyre to hear. 10 Argus on the hill-side nodded, Charmed perforce with pleasing sloth Soon his spirit disembodied Fluttered, a pale moth, Fluttered round and round in error O'er thy lustre softly glassed In the forest streamlet's mirror, Then to Hades passed. 11 Enough! thy beams which long have revelled On the bosom of the wave Reach now the ivies wind-dishevelled Of thy mother's cave. Under its arch of alabaster She sits, or leans above the main: Her happy heart beats fast and faster, Beats to catch thy strain. 12 Tempering all things by the suasion Of gay wiles and flatteries bland, Wave o'er every heart-sick nation Wave once more thy wand! Io Pæan, Io Pæan! Maia's child, henceforth of all The stars that gem this blue Ægean On thee alone I call! ODE TO THE PLANET VENUS. O brightest of the starry eyes, Gladness of morn and evening's boast, That from thy crimson paradise Leadest the heavenly host! Tell us what ministers to thee That dauntless and perpetual glee; And seest thou then indeed below No deeds of Wrong, no shapes of Woe? But thou from that celestial station Glancing at will the wide earth o'er, With equal gift of contemplation Measurest the After and Before:— Were ours a sight as keen and far as thine Our joy were adamantine and divine. Not only seest thou 'mid the storms The ship-boy on some gasping deck, But her not less whose arms Flung wide even now in sleep's alarms Shall yet enwreathe his neck! Not only 'mid the untended bower Some maid, in tears her loose hair steeping, But him who comes, more near each hour, And comes to stay that weeping! Not her alone, the late bereaven, O'er her breathless infant bending, But wingèd choirs their plumes extending To waft the innocent to Heaven! Not only Glory of the Night and Morn, Radiant with love and edged with luminous scorn, The Tyrant seest thou, drowning in mad laughter A nation's groans as with a stormy wind, But Stygian snakes 'mid royal wreaths entwined, And the black Vengeance pacing swiftly after! O Planet blest! The Lover's lamp, the Wanderer's pledge of rest! Delight of men, that givest More beams than thou receivest From all the bright eyes met Upon thy coronet! Lily in Heaven, fresh springing; White, panting antelope Climbing the aerial mountain of perpetual Hope! Sun-smitten, silver Dove, Seated high up and singing On Heaven's wide tree fruited with stars above! O sacred Star, That, brightening all things, seeing them as they are, Take thou a free man's vows— Few gifts do I require: Shine on thy Poet's straw-roofed house; His songs, his heart inspire! TO A GREEK LADY. 1 Those eyes, dark stars of might and gladness! Those eyes that breathe soft gloom, as they Had gathered up the soul of midnight, And poured it back into the day— What secret sources feed their lustres? Their Grecian fountains far away. 2 I see them lifting up their splendour While from its lair some Thought upsprings Or hangs in its aerial lightness Suspended upon balanced wings: Once more they flash, as on its object That Thought in triumph drops and clings. 3 I see those lips whose every motion Is music; fragrance every breath: That cheek which glows like clouds of sunset, Or gleams as mildly as a wreath Of crimson fruit in clear streams imaged Against a dark rich ground beneath! 4 Those hands in grace a moment folded, Light hands with fancies light that play, Lifted as though some lute or viol Hung viewless in the air, and they In passing brushed its cords of silver, Or pointed the sweet sounds their way! 5 I know not quite if Soul or Spirit Within thee dwell;—few care to know:— At least without, and all around thee, A soul is hovering, swift or slow, In undulating halo bending With every movement to and fro! 6 How fresh must be the airs that fanned thee A warbler at thy mother's knee! The wells, thy radiant baths; the ocean; The infinitely-odoured lea; The caverned and Eolian forests— O Isle, Corcyra. how beauteous thou must be! 7 That Queen who held in chains the Roman, That Queen who spurned th' Augustan chains, Sailed by it with her golden galleys; Nor wholly yet the lustre wanes That pageant flung beyond the margin, And inland far o'er vales and plains. 8 Greece slumbers yet; but all her glories Revive in thee: in thee restored She walks the world, while round thy footsteps The might of all her songs is poured; And other times, and lands barbaric Are taught what ancient Earth adored. AN AGED GREEK. I laugh whene'er I hear them say ‘At last his hair is white’— Fools! 'Tis the star of Love all day That crowns me with its light! She, she whose evening revelry Cheers visibly the skies, Looks down from heaven and kisses me With her far-touching eyes. My heart, where'er in youth I strayed, Her silver shafts could thrill: And now this old, unbending head She loves and honours still. With these old locks each breath of air Is proudly pleased to play:— Then how, O wanton mockers, dare Ye tell me I am grey? THE PANTHEIST. The Eagle feeds his eyes upon the sun, And drives the light before him as he plunges On through the east. The mild, smooth-sailing Dove Hath snowy wings that waft her o'er the cloud. The grey Pine tosses in the air, and flings Music and light from his broad boughs. The Reed Sighs in the dreary winds: the large sea-flower Grows in its dark cave like a fair, blind child: But we know not, and we can never know Which is the noblest of those visible shapes, Or which most blest. One all-pervading Spirit Moves in them all, and is to them as life:— The Spirit that encircles Space and Time; That lifts the tides, and downward draws the stars, That beats within the heart of this green globe; That holds the universe upon his breast, And mirrors it upon the mind of man. THE PLATONIST. Forget not thy great birth! that heavenly source From which thy spirit flows, though now in sense Immersed, and bound upon the rolling Earth. Weep not, sad Exile, 'mid the winds, because Thy sides lack wings. The radiance of the Past Still girds thee, as a glorious sunset heaven That glows behind the mountains. Would'st thou more? Beauty is round thee wheresoe'er thou movest: It sounds in every sound; from cloud and flower It gleams upon thee. Be what thou hast been! Draw from the utmost bounds of Life and Love With one long sigh their powers into thy heart; And Thought shall flow from thee in arrowy rays Piercing all space: and Majesty and Joy Invest thee with such glory as he wears Who sits in the centre of the spherèd sun! THE ACADEMIC'S ADDRESS TO TRUTH. 1 O thou condemned to dwell Sole in thy sunless well, Thy faint eyes fixed upon the noontide stars: O instinct-taught to cower Within thy watery bower Seared by the shadow of thy worshippers! 2 The Muses dance around thee: With flowers the Gods have crowned thee: Thy gems make rich the Earth from shore to shore. But yet no hand divine Hath ever closed on thine: And we must pity one whom we adore. 3 No eye can e'er behold thee; No arms shall e'er enfold thee: No kiss shall ever move thy lips apart: Lone, lovely being, fated, Beloved, and yet unmated, To press a cold hand on an unshared heart! 4 Pure Naiad, far too pure To brook thy sorrow's cure, That would'st to any give what none may bear! Take thou—but grant in turn One wild-flower by thine urn Refreshed—this crown that wreathes thy Poet's hair. AN EPICUREAN'S EPITAPH. When from my lips the last faint sigh is blown By Death, dark waver of Lethean plumes, O! press not then with monumental stone This forehead smooth nor weigh me down with glooms From green bowers, grey with dew, Of Rosemary and Rue. Choose for my bed some bath of sculptured marble Wreathed with gay nymphs; and lay me—not alone— Where sunbeams fall, flowers wave, and light birds warble To those who loved me murmuring in soft tone, “Here lies our friend, from pain secure and cold; And spreads his limbs in peace under the sun-warmed mould!” WISDOM. Thou hast no mitre, crown, or sword, or helm; Temple, high place, or academic grove, Or garden of delights, or wrangling mart. An outcast child wert thou, but never nursed By spotted pard. Thee mighty Nature fed With hues and shapes of beauty; slanting showers Perplexed thine infant eyes with their warm drops; Tall trees thy slumbers charmed, and birds let fall Sharp shades upon thy lids; but most of all Serenity came to thee from the stars, And echoing torrents harmonized thy voice. Such was thy nurture. Then Experience stern Added severer lessons. Toils heroic, Manifold labours, conflict long and strange, In darkness; Danger, Doubt, Adversity, Yielded large increase to thy growing thoughts; These, not the schools; a watchful eye, an ear Open to that great voice whose clear behests Stamp upon dutiful hearts, in humble forms, Those great Ideas man was born to learn— These, and thine own right hand, taught thee that lore Terrible to the fools. O eloquent Greece! Here didst thou fail. In that great balance weighed Whose equal scales are Virtue and true Wisdom. Thou wert found wanting. Therefore all thine Arts Were but as flowers that crown a victim's brow. THE ANTIGONE OF SOPHOCLES. I saw the Poet standing by himself At old Colonos (now, alas! no more With dewy laurels fenced, or lit by streams That gush o'er beds of crocus; lulled no longer By that dark choir of quick-winged nightingales That soothed the Eumenides:) he stood in trance, Resting his forehead 'gainst an olive stem Round which one arm hung idly— At last he moved; his head sank slowly back; On his Olympian brow the invisible air Rested serene; his eyelids slowly drooped, Till their dark lashes met with softest touch: At last a rapture swelled his breast, and rising Increased upon his face. As one that inland stands on high-arched downs Pierced by sea-caves, and wondering hears the sea Working beneath—half hears it and half feels, So looked he for a moment; then arose Bright as a god—around his temples wreathed A light of sun-fed locks! silent he stood: It was his hour of immortality! Even at the moment of that trance he saw A glorious vision from his own deep spirit Emerged—a perfect form! o'er earth's dark ball Hanging he saw it, as the Thunderer sees That great creative Thought, mankind's one law— He saw; and cried aloud—Antigone! THE NIGHTINGALE. 1 Tired with my long day's travel At night I laid my head Upon the grass and gravel Of old Cephysus' bed. Yet Sleep her steps susurrent Bent towards me but to fly, Scared back o'er that slow current By a Nightingale hard by. 2 ‘Alas, thou little mourner! Remit that song of woe; Sad Philomela's scorner Was slain long years ago: 'Tis now a time-worn fable: One half was never true; Then why for ever babble Of woes ne'er felt by you?’ 3 The little bird persisted: Like hers my grief was vain: As oft as e'er she listed She poured the same sad strain. Though none might share her weeping, Though none was nigh to praise, All night she ceased not, steeping In melody the sprays. ZOE, AN ATHENIAN CHILD. 1 Blue eyes, but of so dark a blue That sadder souls than mine Find nought but night beneath their dew, Such locks as Proserpine Around her shadowy forehead wears, Made smoother by Elysian airs, And lips whose song spontaneous swells Like airs from Ocean's moonlit shells— These, lovely child! are thine; And that forlorn yet radiant grace That best becomes thy name and race! 2 A forehead orbed into the light; Pure temples marbled round By feathery veins that streak the white, More white thus dimly wound, And taper fingers, hands self-folded, Like shapes of alabaster moulded, And cheek whose blushes are as those Aurora cools on Pindan snows Ere night is yet discrowned— Not brighter, clad in Fancy's hues, Or seen in dream—an Infant Muse! 3 O fetch her from yon Naxian glade One chaplet of the Bacchic vine Or glimmering ivy-wreath yet sprayed With dews that taste like wine! She loves to pace the wild sea shore— O drop her wandering fingers o'er The bosom of some chorded shell: Her touch will make it speak as well As infant Hermes made That tortoise, in its own despite Thenceforth in Heaven a shape star-bright! I. THE TOMB OF AGAMEMNON.—1. Two peaks I saw: one eminent in light; The other shrouded by the shadow thrown From his great brother's bosom on his own: They stood, as Life to Death or Day to Night Opposed. Descending from their common height The mountain rivulet clasped with gentle moan A funeral vault in vernal bravery dight— Through the dim arch a low faint breeze was blown: Not fainter through his murderer's hair unshaken Breathed once the sleeping King! Sad odours blended With that faint breeze: poppies on high suspended Their dark lamps fed as with Elysian oil: While bees low murmured, like the whispering coil Round the sick bed of one men fear to waken! II. THE TOMB OF AGAMEMNON.—2. ‘Ah, fair Briseis! that long, backward gaze On thy Love thrown so silently, was vain: Ah, sad Cassandra! little didst thou gain, Spelling the terror of the future days: Foresight is woe foretasted: Sight betrays: That which we touch is ours: and to retain That little (so man's life Disaster sways) Were hard as water in the palm to strain. The Fates do mock us.’— King of Men! thine ear From Troy's death-cry stern wisdom gathered hath: Look up! a Form bends dreadful o'er thy bath! An axe she bears, and death is in her eyes. The Fates demand thee! they whom the Gods fear— Thee the great Gods give up—their Sacrifice! III. A STATUE OF JUNO. That breadth and amplitude of brow uncrowned; Those awful lids, lifted, nor e'er to close: Those orbs that on their own calm gaze repose; Those lips sedate though wreathed with smiles around: That grand expanse of breast, wherein, enthroned, Majesty dwells, and peaceful pleasure grows And spreads, unheaving its Olympian snows Against that marble zone, their sacred bound; These, and the tall spear like a sceptre grasped, Making a firm foot firmer; and the mien Divine, and sphere in one large hand enclasped, Fitly announce and without words rehearse The Matron Ruler of the World, the Queen Of Gods, and Mistress of the Universe! IV. THE THEATRE AT ARGOS. This rock-hewn theatre, yon stage-like plain, Are not unpeopled: onward in my trance From those blue mountains to the glimmering main A mightier theatre, bright hosts advance; The old Homeric hosts, with spear and lance: The brother monarchs lead the glorious train Car-borne—a herald leans on either rein: Clear rings the trump: bright crests in myriads dance. O'er Juno's Argolis the Sun is set: Her car is here; her tempest-footed steeds: Still on that poppied stone her victim bleeds: Shoreward her Argive ranks are rushing yet; Down the grey sands the last black ship has grated— And now, woe, woe to Troy—her fall is fated! V. THE TOMB OF THEMISTOCLES AT THE PIRÆUS. The Sun is slowly sinking—it is set— Yet still yon mountain range of Megara (Like one that on his palate strives to stay A taste forgone) retains, purpureal yet, The sweet remembrance: crimsoned, the waves fret Against those far-famed Walls that gird the bay, Marmoreal record of a mightier day When, pushed above that rocky parapet In one elliptic wave of blood-stained brine, This gulf, beneath the unwonted weight accurst Of Persia's myriad ships, bounded and burst, And, sinking, left more high its sanguine line Than yonder margin where the Athenian's grave Still in its secret joy engulfs the applauding wave! VI. SOPHOCLES. Alone I wandered through a city lone, (The tomb august, and monumental state Of Empire passed away and desolate) To where, 'mid crumbling frieze, and columns prone. Down a great Temple-court the shades were thrown Of seven majestic Statues calm as Fate: The mouldering altar, like a snowy zone They girt: I midmost in that circle sate. One was a King; and regal though uncrowned, Low-bent he stood, standing as if he slept, With blinded eyes, and chains his feet around: Another was a royal Maid, who kept Her eyes upon an urn funereal pressed By both her marble hands deep deep into her breast. VII. ÆSCHYLUS. A sea-cliff carved into a bas-relief! Dark thoughts and sad, conceived by brooding Nature; Brought forth in storm:—dread shapes of Titan stature, Emblems of Fate, and Change, Revenge, and Grief, And Death, and Life:—a caverned Hieroglyph Confronting still with thunder-blasted frieze All stress of years, and winds, and wasting seas:— The stranger nears it in his fragile skiff And hides his eyes. Few, few shall pass, great Bard, Thy dim sea-portals! Entering, fewer yet Shall pierce thy mystic meanings, deep and hard: But these shall owe to thee an endless debt: The Eleusinian caverns they shall tread That wind beneath man's heart; and wisdom learn with dread. VIII. THE SUN GOD. I saw the Master of the Sun. He stood High in his luminous car, himself more bright; An Archer of immeasurable might: On his left shoulder hung his quivered load; Spurned by his Steeds the eastern mountain glowed; Forward his eager eye, and brow of light He bent; and, while both hands that arch embowed, Shaft after shaft pursued the flying Night. No wings profaned that godlike form: around His neck high held an ever-moving crowd Of locks hung glistening: while such perfect sound Fell from his bowstring, that th' ethereal dome Thrilled as a dewdrop; and each passing cloud Expanded, whitening like the ocean foam. IX. URANIA. Urania! Voice of Heaven, sidereal Muse!— Lo, through the dark vault issuing from afar, She comes, reclining on a lucid star: Her dark eyes, trembling through celestial dews, The glory of high thoughts far off diffuse: While the bright surges of her refluent hair Stream back, upraised upon sustaining air Which lifts that scarf deep-dyed in midnight hues To a wide arch above her hung like heaven. I closed my eyes. Athwart me, like a blast, Music as though of jubilant gods was driven. Once more I gazed. That form divine had passed Earth's dark confine. The ocean's utmost rim Burned yet a moment: then the world grew dim. X. THE ACROPOLIS OF ATHENS.—1. All ye who seek the famed Acropolis, First bathe in old Ilyssus, Muse-loved stream, Whilst yet it laughs in Citherea's beam, Lifting its cheek to catch her fugitive kiss: There drown all thoughts save thoughts of mirth and bliss! Fanciful sighs for rites of old supreme— Now past—blow from you like an idle dream: That which yon Summit ever was it is. Entwine your heads with myrtle: with light heart (A joyful band and deeming joy a duty) Ascend that fairest hill which Earth sustains. A giant Altar vowed to sovran Art It stands; its sacred Offerings sun-clad Fanes, To Beauty raised—owning no God but Beauty! XI. THE ACROPOLIS OF ATHENS.—2. Pallas Athena! deep of soul and wise! Mighty in thought and act; severe of breast; To this high fane, thine ancient region's crest, Descend, and roll once more thine azure eyes O'er th' Olive land, remembering well those ties Which lured thee hither from the World's wide quest, And reared thy seat of venerable rest Under the equal arch of those broad skies! Leave it not ever—round thee stand the mountains; Bright as thy shield when it becomes thy mirror, For victory arming, gleams yon purple Sea: Nor silent yet the old poetic fountains— Make thou thy Sons, redeemed from ancient Error And recent bonds, more vile—strong, pure, and free! XII. THE PRISON OF SOCRATES. (A CAVE OPPOSITE TO THE ACROPOLIS.) Pious the memory, or, if fabulous, The Mythos reverent which such spot assigned Prison of him the wisest of his kind, Self-dedicated to the grave: for thus, By setting suns touched with light dolorous Thy countenance, Pallas, as the day declined Was turned, dread image of a sorrowing mind, On him—as Fancy turns it now on us. But Wisdom's self in all its might and glory On him for ever without shadow shone, In Life as Death. No need of song or story— Authentic or imagined needeth none! Truth bent from Heaven, and fixed on him for aye That gaze whose light is everlasting Day. XIII. WRITTEN WHILE SAILING ON THE GULF OF LEPANTO. All around they lie, deep breath to breath replying, Those outworn seamen in their well-earned sleep: From the blue concave to the dim blue deep No sound beside. Fluttering all night, or sighing, Since morn the breeze delicious hath been dying, And now is dead. On yonder snowy steep The majesty of Day diffused is lying; While Evening's Powers in silence seaward creep From glens that violet-shade the lilac vest Of Delphi's hills. Ye mariners, sleep well! Run slowly, golden sands, and noiselessly! There stands the great Corinthian citadel: Parnassus there: Rest, wearied pinnace, rest! Sleep, sacred air! sleep on, marmoreal sea! XIV. THE SETTING OF THE MOON NEAR CORINTH. From that dejected brow in silence beaming A light it seems too feeble to retain, A sad, calm, tearful light through vapours gleaming, Slowly thou sinkest on the Ægean main; To me an image, in thy placid seeming Of some fair mourner who will not complain; Of one whose cheek is pale, whose eyes are streaming, Whose sighs are heaved unheard,—not heaved in vain. And yet what power is thine? as thou dost sink, Down sliding slow along that azure hollow, The great collected Deep thy course doth follow, Amorous the last of those faint smiles to drink; And all his lifted fleets in thee obey The symbol of an unpresuming sway! XV. CONSTANTINOPLE. Is this the sovereign seat of Constantine? Is that indeed Sophia's far-famed Dome, Where first the Faith was led in triumph home Like some high bride, with banner and bright sign, And melody and flowers? Round yonder shrine The sons, the rivals, yea the lords of Rome, Bowed they in reverence, awed by truths divine Breathed through the golden lips of Chrysostom? But where that conquering Cross, which, high in heaven, That Dome of old surmounted? Angels sweeping The aërial coasts hand now no more suspended— With the wild sea-dirge their chaunts are no more blended— Onward they speed, onward by anguish driven; And the winds waft alone their heavenly weeping. XVI. ISLAM. That Asian ardour, deep, and wide, and still, Which once, like Heaven o'er glowing sands, did brood Over this People's heart, stubborn and rude, Hath left them. Did it yet their pulses fill, They had not lost that fateful might of Will Which from Imaus on to Atlas hewed A way before them—in its terrible mood ‘Making ridiculous’ the boasted skill Of Western Art alike and Arms. Of old This People's spirit was an arch of fire, Like a ‘clear heat at harvest.’ Now remains Nought but the hoary herb and branded plains, Which beasts shall trample, issuing in their ire Forth from the depth of their morasses cold! EUROPA. 1 When from his white chest first he pushed the shining deep that stayed him, Fair-tressed Europa thought the Bull too gentle to upbraid him; Her laughing face thrown back to those who spread their hands to chide him, She sang—‘We all his trappings wrought; yet I alone dared ride him!’ 2 But when her father's towers went down beneath successive surges, And the sweet clamour of her mates grew hoarse amid sea dirges, The simple child her dark eye raised and awe-struck hand to Heaven, And prayed of all the Gods (but most of Jove) to be forgiven! 3 Her small foot first the billow brushed—at last her knee it bedded: Warm felt the waves as lovers' sighs, long-parted or late-wedded: But she her dark eye dim with tears kept fixed, and strove to smother That cry—‘My father and my mates! help Cadmus, help, my brother!’ 4 Behind, the Sea-gods linked their pomp, showing to Jove devotion, And smiles went o'er the purple breadth of loud resounding ocean: O'erawed though knowing not the God, she strove that cry to smother— ‘Alas! my father and my mates! help, Cadmus, help, my brother!’ 5 Hard by old Triton cheered with song the deep sea wildernesses; Far off the Nymphs in myriads rose and mixed their whispering tresses; But Asia's lonely daughter still looked up and strove to smother That cry—‘My father and my mates! help, Cadmus, help, my brother!’ 6 A Pirate's bark to Chios steered:—that pomp they marked with terror, And spectres of forgotten sins rose dark o'er memory's mirror; Their eyes the sailors hid, the Priest made haste a kid to slaughter, And, red as Jove's imperial heart, its life-blood tinged the water. 7 Men say that Venus winked on high, a deeper nectar quaffing— That Phœbus, westward driving, sang, prophetic sang though laughing; ‘Fair maid! more numerous than the tears adown that pale face flowing One day shall gleam the crowns of Kings to thee their sceptres owing!’ 8 Weep, weep no more! yon Cretan shore at last o'er ocean peereth, And every little Love that round, by thee unmarked, careereth In triumph swooping snaps his bow, and claps his hands loud singing, ‘Our precious spoils receive, O Isle, like Delos upward springing!’ STANZAS. 1 All things wax old. What voice shall chase that gloom Which hangs o'er Adam's tomb? Over the patriarchal palm and tent The ocean's vault is bent: Past is the Persian chivalry; and past Old Egypt's lore at last: Where Priam reigned of old, where Homer sang, Barbaric javelins clang: Along the wealthy Carthaginian shores Again the lion roars; And Rome at last her ancient foe deplores. 2 Dead is our Arthur; dead the Cid of Spain; Alfred and Charlemagne. Where now are Europe's wise and holy kings ‘With whom old story rings’? Where now the mitred martyrs of the Faith, Martyrs in life and death? Meek sages, courteous lovers, bards devout, Scorning the world's vain shout? Where now that early Church whose anthemed rites Made Earth like Heaven—her nights Glorious and blest as day with votive lights? 3 Lay down, vain-glorious King, for shame lay down Thy sceptre, globe, and crown! Draw near, my dark-eyed Delphic boy; fill up With Naxian wine my cup. Young Spring hath dropped the rosebud from her breast— Summer her sun-clad crest And Autumn's gorgeous fruits, in vain increased, But spread her funeral feast. Dark Winter, mailed with ice, and stern and hoar, I praise much more— To him this last libation I will pour. GREEK IDYLS. 1.—GLAUCÈ. I love you, pretty maid, for you are young: I love you, pretty maid, for you are fair: I love you, pretty maid, for you love me. They tell me that, a babe, smiling you gazed Upon the stars, with open, asking eyes, And tremulous lips apart. Erelong, self-taught, You found for every star and every flower Legends and names and fables sweet and new. Oh that when far away I still might see thee! How oft, when wearied with the din of life On thee mine eyes would rest, thy Grecian heavens Brightening that orbèd brow!— Hesper should shine upon thee, lamp of Love, Beneath whose radiance thou wert born. O Hesper! Thee will I love and reverence evermore! Bind up that shining hair into a knot And let me see that polished neck of thine Uprising from the bed snow-soft, snow-white In which it rests so gracefully! What God Hath drawn upon thy forehead's ivory plane Those two clear streaks of sweet and glistening black Lifted in earnest mirth or lovely awe? Open those Pleiad eyes, liquid and tender, And let me lose myself among their depths! Caress me with thine infant hands, and tell me Old tales divine that love makes ever new Of Gods and men entoiled in flowery nets, Of heroes sighing all their youth away, And Troy, death-sentenced by those Argive eyes. Come forth, dear maid, the day is calm and cool, And bright though sunless. Like a long green scarf, The tall Pines crowning yon grey promontory In distant ether hang, and cut the sea. But lovers better love the dell, for there Each is the other's world. How indolently The tops of those pale poplars bend and sway Over the violet-braided river-brim! Whence comes their motion, for no wind is heard, And the long grasses move not, nor the reeds? Here we will sit, and watch the rushes lying Like locks, along the leaden-coloured stream Far off—and thou, O child, shalt talk to me Of Naiads and their loves. A blissful life They lead who live beneath the flowing waters: They cherish calm, and think the sea-weeds fair: They love each other's beauty; love to stand Among the lilies, holding back their tresses And listening, with their gentle cheek reclined Upon the flood, to some far melody Of Pan or shepherd piping in lone woods Until the unconscious tears run down their face. Mild are their loves, nor burdensome their thoughts— And would that such a life were mine and thine! 2.—IONÈ. Ionè, fifteen years have o'er you passed, And, taking nothing from you in their flight, Have given you much. You look like one for whom The day has morning only, time but Spring. Your eyes are large and calm, your lips serene, As if no Winter with your dreams commingled, You that dream always, or that never dream! Dear maid, you should have been a shepherdess— But no: ill-tended then your flocks had strayed! Young fawns you should have led; such fawns as once The quivered Queen had spared to startle! Then Within your hand a willow wand, your brow Wreathed with red roses dabbled in warm rains, How sweetly, with half-serious countenance, Through the green alleys had you ta'en your way! And they, your spotted train, how happily Would they have gambolled by you—happiest she The milk-white creature in the silver chain! Ionè, lay the tapestry down: come forth: No golden ringlet shall you add this morn To bright Apollo: and poor Daphne there! Without her verdant branches she must rest Another day—a cruel tale, sweet girl! You will not! Then farewell our loves for ever! We are too far unlike; not Cyclops more Unlike that Galatea whom he wooed. I love the loud-resounding sea divine; I love the wintry sunset, and the stress Inexorable of wide-wasting storms; I love the waste of foam-washed promontories; The singing of the topmost mountain pines In safety heard far down; the ringing sleet, Thunder, and all portentous change that makes The mind of mortals like to suns eclipsed Waning in icy terrors. These to you Are nothing. On the ivied banks you lie In deep green valleys grey with noontide dew; There bathe your feet in bubbling springs, your hands Playing with the moist pansies near your face. These bowers are musical with nightingales Morning and noon and night. Among these rocks A lovely life is that you lead; but I Will make it lovelier with some pretty gift If you are constant to me! Constant never Was Nymphor Nereid:—like the waves they change— O Nymph, so change not thou! A boat I'll make Scooped from a pine: yourself shall learn to row it; Swifter than winds or sounds can fleet; or else Your scarf shall be the sail, and you shall glide, While the stars drop their light upon the bay, On like a bird between the double heaven! Are these but trivial joys? Ah me! fresh leaves Gladden the forests; but no second life Invests our branches—feathers new make bright The birds; but when our affluent locks desert us, No Spring restores them. Dried-up streams once more The laughing Nymphs replenish; but man's life, By fate drawn down and smothered in the sands, Never looks up. Alas! my sweet Ionè, Alcæus also loved; but in his arms Finds rest no more the song-full Lesbian maid, Her breast all shaken by the storm of song, Or thrills of song unborn! The indignant hand attesting Gods and men Achilles lifts no more: to dust is turned His harp that glittered through the wild sea spray, Though the black wave falls yet on Ilion's shore. All things must die—the Songs themselves, except The devout hymn of grateful love; or hers, The wild swan's, chaunting her death melody. 3.—LYCIUS. Lycius! the female race is all the same! All variable, as the Poets tell us; Mad though caprice—half way 'twixt men and children! Acasta, mildest late of all our maids, Colder and calmer than a sacred well, Is now more changed than Spring has changed these woods; Hers is the fault, not mine. Yourself shall judge. From Epidaurus, where for three long days With Nicias I had stayed, honouring the God, If strength might thus mine aged Sire renerve, Last evening we returned. The way was dull And vexed with mountains: tired ere long was I From warding off the oleander boughs Which, as my comrade o'er the stream's dry bed Pushed on, closed backward on my mule and me. The flies maintained a melody unblest; While Nicias, of his wreath Nemean proud, Sang of the Satyrs and the Nymphs all day Like one by Esculapius fever-smitten. Arrived at eve, we bathed; and drank, and ate Of figs and olives till our souls exulted: Lastly we slept like Gods. While morning shone, So filled was I with weariness and sleep That as a log till noon I lay, then rose, And in the bath-room sat. While there I languished Reading that old, divine and holy tale Of sad Ismenè and Antigonè, Two warm soft hands around me sudden flung Closed both my eyes; and a clear, shrill, sweet laughter Told me that she it was, Acasta's self, That brake upon my dreams. ‘What would you, child?’ ‘Child, child!’ Acasta cried, ‘I am no child— You do me wrong in calling me a child! Come with me to the willowy river's brim: There read, if you must read.’ Her eyes not less Than hands uplifted me, and forth we strayed. O'er all the Argolic plain Apollo's shafts So fiercely fell, methought the least had slain A second Python. From that theatre Hewn in the rock the Argive tumult rolled: Before the fane of Juno seven vast oxen Lowed loud, denouncing Heaven ere yet they fell: While from the hill-girt meadows rose a scent So rich, the salt sea odours vainly strove To pierce those fumes it curled about my brain, And sting the nimbler spirits. Nodding I watched The pale herbs from the parched bank that trailed Bathing delighted in voluptuous cold, And scarcely swayed by that slow winding stream: I heard a sigh—I asked not whence it came. At last a breeze went by, to glossy waves Rippling the steely flood: I noted then The reflex of the poplar stem thereon Curled into spiral wreaths, and toward me darting Like a long, shining water-snake: I laughed To see its restlessness. Acasta cried, ‘Read—if you will not speak—or look at me!’ Unconsciously I glanced upon the page, Bent o'er it, and began to chaunt that song, ‘Favoured by Love are they that love not deeply,’ When, leaping from my side, she snatched the book, Into the river dashed it, bounded by, And, no word spoken, left me there alone. Lycius! I see you smile; but know you not Nothing is trifling which the Muse records, And lovers love to muse on? Let the Gods Act as to them seems fitting. Hermes loved— Phœbus loved also—but the hearts of Gods Are everlasting like the suns and stars, Their loves as transient as the clouds. For me A peaceful life is all I seek, and far Removed from cares and all the female kind! LINES WRITTEN UNDER DELPHI. I. My goal is reached—homeward henceforth my way. I have beheld Earth's glories. Had the eyes Of those I love reposed on them with mine, No future wish to roam beyond the range Of one green pasture circling one clear lake Itself by one soft woodland girt around, Could touch this heart. My pilgrimage is made. II. I have seen Delphi: I no more shall see it: I go contented, having seen it once; Yet here awhile remain, prisoner well-pleased Of reboant winds. Within this mountain cove Their sound alone finds entrance. Lightly the waves, Rolled from the outer to the inner bay, Dance in blue silver o'er the silver sands; While, like a chain-bound antelope by some child Mocked oft with tempting hand and fruit upheld, Our quick caique vaults up among the reeds, The ripples that plunge past it upward sending O'er the grey margin matted with sea-pink Ripplings of light. The moon is veiled; a mile Below the mountain's eastern range it hangs; Yon gleam is but its reflex, from white clouds Scattered along Parnassian peaks of snow. III. I see but waves and snows. Memory alone Fruition hath of what this morn was mine: O'er many a beauteous scene at once she broods, And feeds on joys without confusion blent Like mingling sounds or odours. Now she rests On that serene expanse, the confluence Of three long vales, in sweetness upward heaved, Ample and rich as Juno's breast what time The Thunderer's breath in sleep moves over it: Bathes in those runnels now, that raced in light This morn as at some festival of streams, Through arbutus and ilex, wafting each Upon its glassy track a several breeze, Each with its tale of joy or playful sadness. Fair nymphs, by great Apollo's fall untouched! Sing, sing, for ever! When did golden Phœbus Look sad one moment for a fair nymph's fall? IV. A still, black glen—below, a stream-like copse Of hoary olives; rocks like walls beside, Never by Centaur trod, though these fresh gales Give man the Centaur's strength. Again I mount, From cliff to cliff, from height to height ascend; Glitters Castalia's Fount; I see, I touch it! That Rift once more I reach, the Oracular seat, Whose arching rocks half meet in air suspense;— 'Twixt them is one blue streak of heaven; hard by Dim Temples hollowed in the stone, for rites Mysterious shaped, or mansions of the dead: Released, I turn, and see, far, far below, A vale so rich in floral garniture, And perfume from the orange and the sea, So girt with white peaks flashing from sky chasms, So lighted with the vast blue dome of Heaven, So lulled with music from the winds and waves, The guest of Phœbus claps his hand and shouts, ‘There is but one such spot; from Heaven Apollo Beheld;—and chose it for his earthly shrine!’ V. Phœbus Apollo! loftiest shape of all That glorified the range of Grecian song, By Poet hymned or Shepherd when the rocks Confessed the first bright impress of thy feet; By many an old man praised when Thracian blasts Sang loud, and pine-wood stores began to fail; Served by the sick man searching hill and plain For herb assuasive; courted by sad maids On whose pure lips thy fancied kiss descended Softly as vernal beam on primrose cold: By Fortune's troubled favourites ofttime sued For dubious answer, then when Fate malign, Ascending o'er the horizon of high Hopes, Her long fell glance had cast on them—Apollo, Who, what wert thou? Let those that read thy tale In clouded chambers of the North, reply, ‘An empty dream!’—bid them fling far the scroll, The dusty parchment cast aside for ever, Or scan with light from thy Parnassian skies! For Commentator's lamp give them thine orb Flaming on high, transfixing cloud and wave Or noon-tide laurel—(as the Zephyr strikes it Daphnè once more shrinks trembling from thy beams)— Were these but fancies? O'er the world they reared The only empire verily universal Founded by man—for Fancy heralds Thought; Thought Act; and nations Are as they Believe. Strong were such fancies; strong not less than fair! The plant spontaneous of Society In Greece, by them with stellar power was dewed, And, nursed by their far influence, grew and flowered: A state of order and fair fellowship, Man with man walking, not in barbarous sort His own prey finding, each, and his own God; A state of freedom, not by outward force Compressed, or ice-like knit by negatives; A frank communion of deep thoughts with glad, Light cares with grave; a changeful melody Varying each moment, yet in soul the same; A temple raised for beauty and defence; An armed dance held for a festival; A balanced scheme that gave each power a limit, Each toil a crown, and every art her Muse! Oh frank and graceful life of Grecian years! Whence came thy model? From the Grecian heaven The loves and wars of Gods, their works and ways, Their several spheres distinct yet interwreathed, By Greece were copied on a lesser stage. Our thoughts soar high to light our paths on earth: Terrestrial circles from celestial take Their impress in man's science: Stars unreached Our course o'er ocean guide: Orphean sounds The walls of cities raised:—thus mythic bards For all the legislators legislated! VI. Yet these were idols: such as worshipped these Were worshippers of idols. Holy and True! How many are there not idolaters? Traditions, Systems, Passion, Interest, Power— Are these not idols? Ay, of idols worst! Not that men worship these; but that before them Down-bent, the faculty that worship pays Shrivels and dies. Man's spirit alone adores, And can adore but Spirit. What is not God, Howe'er our fears may crouch, or habit grovel, Or sensuous fancy dote, we worship not: Unless God looks on man, he cannot pray; Such is Idolatry's masked Atheism! —Yes, these were idols, for man made them such! By a corrupt heart all things are corrupted, God's works alike or products of the mind. The Soul, insurgent 'gainst its Maker, lacks The strength its vassal powers to rule. The Will To blind Caprice grows subject: Reason, torn From Faith, becomes the Understanding's slave; And Passion's self in Appetite is lost. Then Idols dominate—Despots by Self-Will Set up, where Law and Faith alike are dead, To awe the anarchy of godless souls. Nought but a Worship, spiritual and pure, Profound, habitual, strong through loving awe, A true heart's tribute to the God of Truth, From selfishness redeemed, and so from sense Secured, though conversant with shapes of sense, Nought but such Worship, with spontaneous force From our whole Being equably ascending As odour from a flower or fount's clear breath, Redeems us from Idolatry. In vain Are proudly wise appeals that deprecate Rites superstitious; vain are words though shrill With scorn—stark, pointed finger—forehead ridged With blear-eyed Scepticism's myriad wrinkles: Saintly we must be, or Idolatrous. After his image Man creates him Gods, Kneading the symbol (as a symbol, pure And salutary) to a form compact With servile soul and mean mechanic hand: Thus to their native dust his Thoughts return, Abashed, and of mortality convinced. VII. At Salem was the Law. The Holy Land Its orient terrace by the ocean reared, And thereon walked the Holy One, at cool Of the world's morn: there visible state He kept. At Salem was the Law on stone inscribed; But over all the world, within man's heart The unwritten Law abode, from earliest time Upon our nature stampt, nor wholly lost. Men saw it, loved it, praised—and disobeyed. Therefore the Conscience, whose applausive voice Their march triumphant should have led with joy To all perfection, from a desert pealed The Baptist's note alone; ‘Repent, repent;’ And men with song more flattering filled their ears. Yet still the undersong was holy! long (Though cast on days unblest, though sin-defiled) The mind accepted, yea, the heart revered, That which the Will lacked strength to follow. Conscience, Her crown monarchal first, her fillet next Snatched from her sacred brows, a minstrel's wreath Assumed, and breathed in song her soul abroad: On outcast Duty's grave she, with her tears, Dropt flowers funereal of surpassing beauty; With Reason walked; the right path indicated, Though her imperative voice was heard no more. Nor spake in vain. Man, fallen man, was great, Remembering ancient greatness: Hymn and tale Held, each, some portion of dismembered Truth, Severely sung by Poets wise and brave. They sang of Justice, God's great Attribute, With tragic buskin, and a larger stride Following the fated victim step by step: They sang of Love crowning the toils of life: Of Joy they sang; for Joy, that gift divine, Primal and wingèd creature, with full breath Through all the elastic limbs of Grecian fable Poured her redundant life, the noble tongue Strong as the brazen clang of ringing arms, With resonance of liquid sounds enriching Sweet as the music-laughter of the Gods: Of heavenly Pity, Prophet-like they sang; And, feeling after good though finding not, Of Him, that Good not yet in Flesh revealed, By ceaseless vigils, tears, and lifted palms, And yearnings infinite and unrepressed, A separate and authentic witness bore. Thus was the end foreshown. Thus Error's ‘cloud Turned forth its silver lining on the night.’ Thus too—for us at least a precious gift, Dear for the lore it grasped, by all it lacked Sternly made bold vain-glorious thoughts to chide, Wisdom shone forth—but not for men unwise: Her beams but taint the dead. Man's Guilt and Woe She proved; and her own Helplessness confessed. Such were her two great functions. Woe to those Who live with Art for Faith, and Bards for Priests! These are supplanted: Sense their loftiest hopes Will sap; and Fiends usurp their oracles! VIII. Olympian dreams, farewell! your spell is past: I turn from you away! From Eros' self, From heavenly Beauty on thy crystal brow Uranian Venus, starred in gentlest light, From thee, Prometheus, chained on Caucasus, Io, from thee, sad wanderer o'er the earth, From thee, great Hercules, the son of Heaven And of Humanity held long in pain; Heroic among men; by labours tried; Descending to the Shades, and leading thence The Lost; while infant still, a Serpent-slayer; In death a dread and mystic Sacrifice: From thee, more high than all, from thee, Apollo! Light of the world whose sacred beam, like words, Illustrated the forehead of the earth; Supreme of Harmonists, whose song flowed forth Pure from that light; great slayer of the Serpent That mocked thy Mother; master of that art Helpful to anguished flesh; Oracular: Secretly speaking wisdom to the just; Openly to the lost from lips despised Like thy Cassandra's flinging it to waste; Phœbus Apollo! here at thy chief shrine From thee I turn, and stern confession make That not the vilest weed yon ripple casts Here at my feet, but holds a loftier gift Than all the Grecian Legends! Let them go— Because the mind of man they lifted up. But corruptible instincts grovelling left On Nature's common plane—yea, and below it; Because they slightly healed the People's wound, And sought in genial fancy, finite hopes, Proportioned life, and dialectic Art, A substitute for Virtue; and because They gave for nothing that which Faith should earn Casting the pearls of Truth 'neath bestial feet: Because they washed the outside of the cup, And dropped a thin veil o'er the face of Death; Because they neither brought man to his God, Nor let him feel his weakness—let them go! Wisdom that raises not her sons is Folly: Truth in its unity alone is Truth. IX. What now is Delphi? Where that temple now Dreadful to kings; with votive offerings stored, Tripod, or golden throne from furthest lands, Or ingot huge? Where now that tremulous stone, Centre of all things deemed—Earth's beating heart? What now is Delphi? yea, or Hellas' self, With all her various States; epitome Of Nations; stage whereon in little space Forecasting Time rehearsed his thousand parts? Sparta's one camp; the sacred plain of Thebes; That plain, pious as rich, whence grateful Ceres The band that blesses Earth upraised to Heaven; The unboastful freedom of Arcadian vales; Athens with Academic Arts, and ships Far-seen from pillared headlands? Where, O where Olympia's chariot-course that bent the eyes Of Greece on one small ring shining like fire; Or they, that sacred Council, at whose nod King and Republic trembled? Gone for ever! Vine on the wave diffused, budding with Isles; Bower of young Earth, wherein the East and West, Wedded, their beauteous progeny upreared; Hellas, by Nature blest, by Freedom nursed, By Providence led on through discipline Of change, till that Philosophy was formed Which made one City man's perpetual Teacher— Hellas is past! A lamentable voice Forth from the caverns of Antiquity Issuing in mystery, answers, Where is Egypt? Egypt of magic craft and starry lore, Eternal brooder on the unknown Past Through the long vista of her Kings and Priests Descried, as setting Moon beyond the length Of forest aisle, or desert colonnade; Eldest of nations, and apart, like Night Dark-veiled amid the synod of the Gods? The sun and stars, above her circling, stare At pyramids sand-drowned and long processions Now petrified to lines of marble shapes That lead to Sphinx-girt Cities of the Dead. Where now is Babylon, mighty by peace And gold, and men countless as forest leaves? Persia, the Macedonian, Carthage, Tyre? All gone—restored to earth! Great Rome herself. Haughty with arcs of triumph, theatres Sphered to embrace all Nations and their Gods; Roads from one centre piercing lands remote; Bridges, fit type of conquest's giant stride; Great Rome herself, empire of War and Law, Yoking far regions, harrowing those fields Reserved for Christian seed—Great Rome herself Was, and is not! The eternal edict stands: The power from God which comes not, drops and dies. X. Hark, to that sound! yon ocean Eagle drives The mist of morn before her, seaward launched From her loved nest on Delphi. She though stern, Can love—a divine instinct, that outlasts Phœbus, thy fabulous honours! Far away The storms are dying, and the night-bird pours, Encouraged thus, her swift and rapturous song. Ah! when that song is over, I depart! Return, my wandering thoughts! the ascending Moon Smiles on her Brother's peaks, and many a ridge Her glance solicits; many a stirring wood Exults in her strong radiance as she glides On from the pine gulf to the gulf of clouds. Return, my thoughts! the innumerous cedar cones Of Lebanon must lull you now no more, Nor fall of Empires with as soft a sound. O'er famed Colonos stoop no more in trance, Eyeing the city towers. No longer muse, With mind divided, though a single heart, On legend—true or erring! Earth can yield No scene more fair than this—and Nature's beauty Is ever irreproachable. Return! A long breath take of this ambrosial clime Ere lost the sweetness: sigh, yet be content: Fill here your golden urns; be fresh for ever! XI. I have beheld Mont Blanc, in eminence, Though seated, over all his standing sons, Unearthly Ermite whose cell is Heaven; His glacier beard forth-streaming to his feet Beyond his cloudy raiment. I have gazed On Rome; have watched it from the Alban hill; Have marked that Dome supreme, its mitred crown, Dilate at sunset o'er the Latian bounds. Byzantium I have seen: first capital That owned the Faith; whose rising up once more Shall be as mighty gates their ‘heads uplifting’ O'er all the earth, for God to enter in. These three have I beheld: to these henceforth I add a fourth to stand with these for ever. On rock or tree my name I dare not trace— Delphi! stamp thou thine image on my heart. KING HENRY THE SECOND AT THE TOMB OF KING ARTHUR, AND OTHER POEMS. To the Memory OF SIR WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON, LATE ASTRONOMER-ROYAL OF DUBLIN, THESE POEMS, ORIGINALLY DEDICATED TO HIM, ARE AGAIN INSCRIBED. Nov. 24, 1883. KING HENRY THE SECOND AT THE TOMB OF KING ARTHUR. PART I. 1 Why put the great in Time their trust? Whate'er on earth we prize Of dust was made, and is but dust, For all its brave disguise. No boor but one day with the just May triumph in the skies! 2 Ambition doth but chase a gleam; An idle toy the sword! The crown a mockery; power a dream; For Christ alone is Lord. This lore King Henry learned:—Of him I will a tale record. 3 The tourney past, in festival Baron and knight were met: Last pomp it was that graced the hall Of great Plantagenet; A Prince for valour praised by all, More famed for wisdom yet. 4 The board rang loud with kingly cheer: Light jest, and laugh, and song Rang swiftly round from peer to peer: Alone on that gay throng The harper looked with eye severe, The while in unknown tongue 5 A mournful dirge abroad he poured; Sad strains, forlorn, and slow: Poor wreck of music prized and stored Long centuries ago On British hills ere Saxon sword Had stained as yet their snow. 6 ‘Strike other chords,’ the monarch cried; ‘Whate'er thy words may be, They sound the dirge of festal pride: Warriors, not monks are we! The melodies to grief allied No music make for me.’ 7 The harper's eye with warlike fire One moment shone; no more: His lips, but now compressed in ire, A smile disdainful wore, While forth from each resounding wire Its fiercer soul he tore. 8 Louder and louder pealed the strain, More wild, and soul-entrancing: Picturing now helmets cloven in twain; Now swords like meteors glancing; Now trampling hosts o'er hill and plain Retreating and advancing. 9 Each measure, mightier than the last, Rushed forth, stern triumphs wooing; Like some great angel on the blast From Heaven to Heaven pursuing With outspread pinion, far and fast, A host abhorred to ruin. 10 The bard meanwhile with cold, stern air, Looked proudly on the proud, Fixing unmoved a victor's stare On that astonished crowd— 'Till all the princes gathered there Leaped up, and cried aloud: 11 ‘What man, what chief, what crownèd head, Eternal heir of fame, Of all that live, or all the dead, This praise shall dare to claim?’— Then rose that British bard, and said, ‘King Arthur is his name.’ 12 ‘What sceptre grasped King Arthur's hand?’ ‘The sceptre of this Isle.’ ‘What nations bled beneath his brand?’ ‘The Saxon foe erewhile.’ ‘His tomb?’ was Henry's next demand— ‘He sleeps in yonder pile.’ 13 Forth went the King with all his train, At the mid hour of night; They paced in pairs the silent plain Under the red torch-light. The moon was sinking in her wane, The tower yet glimmered bright. PART II. 1 Through Glastonbury's cloister dim The midnight winds were sighing; Chanting a low funereal hymn For those in silence lying, Death's gentle flock 'mid shadows grim Fast bound, and unreplying. 2 Hard by, the monks their Hours were saying; The organ evermore Its wave in alternation swaying On that smooth swell upbore The voice of their melodious praying Towards heaven's eternal shore. 3 Ere long a princely multitude Moved on through arches grey Which yet, though shattered, stand where stood (God grant they stand for aye!) Saint Joseph's church of woven wood On England's baptism day. 4 The grave they found; their swift strokes fell Piercing dull earth and stone. They reached ere long an oaken cell, And cross of oak, whereon Was graved, ‘Here sleeps King Arthur well, In the Isle of Avalon.’ 5 The mail on every knightly breast, The steel at each man's side, Sent forth a sudden gleam: each crest Bowed low its plumèd pride: Down o'er the coffin stooped a priest— But first the monarch cried, 6 ‘Great King! in youth I made a vow Earth's mightiest son to greet; His hand to worship; on his brow To gaze; his grace entreat. Therefore, though dead, till noontide thou Shalt fill my royal seat!’ 7 Away the massive lid they rolled— Alas! what found they there? No kingly brow, no shapely mould; But dust where such things were. Ashes o'er ashes, fold on fold— And one bright wreath of hair. 8 Genevra's hair! like gold it lay; For Time, though stern, is just, And humblest things feel last his sway, And Death reveres his trust.— They touched that wreath; it sank away From sunshine into dust! 9 Then Henry lifted from his head The Conqueror's iron crown: That crown upon that dust he laid, And knelt in reverence down, And raised both hands to heaven, and said, ‘Thou God art King alone! 10 ‘Lie there, my crown, since God decrees This head a couch as low! What am I better now than these Six hundred years ago? Henceforth all mortal pageantries I count an idle show.’ 11 Such words King Henry spake: and ere The cloistral vaults had felt Along their arches damp and bare The last faint echo melt, The nobles congregated there On that cold pavement knelt: 12 And each his coronet down laid, And Christ his King adored; And murmured in that mournful shade, ‘Thou God alone art Lord: Like yonder hair, at last shall fade Each sceptre, crown, and sword.’ EPITAPH. He roamed half round this world of woe, Where toil and labour never cease; Then dropped one little span below, In search of Peace. And now to him mild beams and showers, All that he needs to grace his tomb, From loneliest regions, at all hours. Unsought-for come. THE INFANT BRIDAL. In the Middle Ages the marriage of children was no infrequent mode of reconciling nations. The custom was natural in a time when belief insisted on expressing itself in symbols, and when the whole of earthly life was regarded as a rehearsal of, and betrothal to, a Life Divine. PART I. 1 Of old between two nations was great war: Its cause no mortal knew; nor when begun; Therefore they combated so much the more, The sire his sword bequeathing to the son; Till gentleness and joy had wholly fled, And wellnigh every hand with blood was red. 2 In vain the mother wept; her sighs were blown Away by the loud gust of popular rage; In vain the young fair widow made her moan; In vain the tender virgin would engage Her love to gentler thoughts; he rushed to arms, Proud of her beauty pale and loud alarms. 3 Glory, for Honour a blind substitute In hearts aspiring and a servile will, On to the battle chased them. Man and brute, Horseman and horse, by the same trumpet-thrill Were borne into the frenzy of red fields, Ghastly ere night with dead, upstaring from their shields. 4 Glory at first, and after Glory, Shame; Shame to propose the compact, first to bend; And Fear, which masks full oft in Valour's name, And doth false honour like a shade attend— Fear to be thought to fear—these plagues did urge The maniacs forward with a threefold scourge. 5 Both kingdoms raging thus in fever fit, More direful every hour became their spleen: The sleeping boy full oft his brow would knit Against a foeman he had never seen; Full oft the man of venerable hairs Bowed to the dust his head depressed by griefs and cares. 6 Valley and town lay drowned in tears and sorrow; Each noontide trembled with perturbed annoy, And no one dared expect a kinder morrow: To be a mother was no more a joy: Hope no more hovered o'er the cradle. Love Wept; and no friend had heart such anguish to reprove. 7 How often to a little sleeping child, Smiling, and sleeping on the mother's knee, That mother thus complained; ‘Ah, little child! God only knows if it be good for thee, My comforter, my solace, to have come Down to this world so harsh and wearisome 8 ‘Happy awhile with me thy spirit dwells;’ Awhile contented 'mid thy petty range Of daily things, to thee all miracles; For arms thou dost not sigh, nor pant for change; Thy dreams are bloodless: thou dost smile when sleeping, In Eden founts thy newborn fancies steeping. 9 ‘Ah, must that brow, so clear, so smooth, so white, By a hard ruthless helm be one day pressed? Ah, must the red lance in its murderous might One day pierce through and gore that tender breast? Ah, little infant! must thou lie one day Far, far from me, cold clay upon cold clay? 10 ‘Wherefore so fast do these thy ringlets grow? Stay, little child, be alway what thou art, That I may ever, while the rough winds blow, Clasp thee as now, and hide thee in my heart. Who taught thee those new words? I fear each day, To hear thee cry, “Mother, I must away.” 11 ‘Is this to be a mother? I am none— And yet I fear to lose a gift not prized. Is this, ah God, to have a little son? Are these my prayers? my dreams thus realized? Defrauded of my own while visibly here, How can I hope, O child, to deck far off thy bier?’ PART II. 1 The hosts, in silence marching all the night, At sunrise met upon the battle plain. The monarchs there engaged in single fight: There by a rival's hand was either slain. Long time men stood in gloom, stern, and sad-hearted; Then, bound by solemn vows, homeward in peace departed. 2 A counsel went there forth. Each king had left Behind a blooming infant; one a boy, A girl the other; both alike bereft; Both innocent; both meet for love and joy; Both heirs of sorrow. ‘Holy Church these twain Shall join in one,’ men cried; ‘and peace be ours again.’ 3 Who first devised the expedient no one knows. Perhaps old sages, after long debate, And loud lament of immemorial woes, Bending their deep brows in a hall of state, Conceived the project; and from Fancy sought A cure for ills by rage fantastic wrought. 4 Some chief perhaps, of all his sons bereft, And now half blind in his forlorn old age, Cried loud in anguish, while his tower he left To hide him in a moss-grown hermitage, ‘Hear ye my words, and on your hearts engrain them, Love gave me many children: Hate hath slain them.’ 5 Haply some maiden, for the war deserted, Exclaimed, ‘I would that little warlike pair Had loved as long as war the loved hath parted.’ Perhaps kind angels called her wish a prayer. Enough: I tell an ancient legend, told By better men than I, long dead and cold. 6 While the young bride in triumph home was led, They strewed beneath her litter branches green; And kissed light flowers, then rained them on a head Unconscious as the flowers what all might mean. Men, as she past them, knelt; and women raised Their children in their arms, who laughed and gazed. 7 That pomp approaching woodland villages, Or shadowing convents piled near rivers dim, The church-bells from gray towers begirt with trecs Reiterated their loud, wordless hymn; And golden cross, and snowy choir serene Moved on, old trunks and older towers between. 8 An hour ere sunset from afar they spied The city walls, dark myriads round them clinging: Now o'er a carpeted expanse they glide, Now the old bridge beneath their tread is ringing: They reach the gate—they pass the towers below— And now once more emerge, a glittering show! 9 O what a rapturous shout receives them, blending Uncounted bells with chime of human voices! That fortress old, as on thy wind ascending, Like the mother of some victor chief rejoices. From every window tapestries wave: among The steep and glittering roofs group after group they throng. 10 The shrine is gained. Two mighty gates expanding Let forth a breeze of music onward gushing, In pathos lulled, yet awful and commanding; Down sink the crowds, at once their murmur hushing. Filled with one soul, the smooth procession slowly Advances with joined palms, cross-led and slowly. 11 Lo! where they stand in yon high, fan-roofed chamber— Martyrs and Saints in dyed and mystic glass With sumptuous haloes, vermeil, green and amber, Flood the far aisles, and all that by them pass: Rich like their painter's visions—in those gleams Blazoning the burden of his Patmian dreams! 12 A forest of tall lights in mystic cluster Like fire-topped reeds, from their aerial station Pour on the group a mild and silver lustre: Beneath the blessing of that constellation The rite proceeds—pure source whence rich increase Of love henceforth, and piety and peace. 13 Small was the ring, and small in truth the finger! What then? the faith was large that dropped it down: A faith that scorned on this base earth to linger, And won from Heaven a perdurable crown. A germ of Love, at plighting of that troth Into each bosom sank; and grew there with its growth. 14 The ladies held aloft the bridal pair: They on each other smiled, and gazed around With lofty mien benign and debonair, Their infant brows with golden circlet bound: The prelates blessed them, and the nobles swore True faith and fealty by the swords they bore. 15 Home to the palace, still in order keeping, That train returned; and in the stateliest room Laid down their lovely burden, all but sleeping, Together in one cradle's curtained gloom: And lulled them with low melody and song, And jest past lightly 'mid the courtly throng. PART III. 1 Ah, lovely sight! behold them—creatures twain, Hand in hand wandering through some verdant alley, Or sunny lawn of their serene domain, Their wind-caught laughter echoing musically; Or skimming, in pursuit of bird-cast shadows, With feet immaculate the enamelled meadows. 2 Tiptoe now stand they by some towering lily, And fain would peer into its snowy cave: Now, the boy bending o'er some current chilly, The feebler backward draws him from the wave; But he persists, and gains for her at last Some bright flower from the dull weeds hurrying past. 3 Oft if some agèd priest the cloister crossed, Both hands they caught; and bade him explicate, That nought of good through idlesse might be lost, At large all duties of the nuptial state; And oft each other kissed with infant glee, As though this were some great solemnity. 4 In some old missal sometimes would they look, Touching with awe the illuminated page; And scarce for tears the spectacle might brook Of babes destroyed by Herod's murderous rage. Here sank a Martyr in ensanguined vest: With more familiar smile there beamed the Virgin blest. 5 Growing, their confidence as quickly grew; Light pet and childish quarrel seldom came: To make them lighter yet and yet more few, Their nurse addressed them thus—an ancient dame— ‘Children, what perfect love should dwell, I ween, 'Twixt husband and young wife, 'twixt King and Queen. 6 ‘The turtle, widowed of her mate, no more Lifts her lone head, but pines, and pining dies: In many a tomb 'mid yon Cathedral hoar Monarch or Knight beside his lady lies; Such tenderness and truth they showed, that fate No power was given their dust to separate. 7 ‘Rachel not less, and Ruth, whereof men read In book ordained our life below to guide, Loved her own husband each, in word and deed, Loved him full well, nor any loved beside: And Orpheus too, and Pyramus, men say, Though Paynim born, lived true, and so shall live for aye. 8 ‘What makes us, children, to good Angels dear? Unblemished Truth and hearts in pure accord: These also draw the people to revere With stronger faith their King and Sovereign Lord. Then perfect make your love and amity Alway: but most of all if men are by.’ 9 Such lore receiving ofttimes, hand in hand Those babes walked gravely: at the garden gates Meantime the multitude would flock and stand, And hooded nuns looked downward from their grates. These when the Princes marked, they moved awhile With loftier step and more majestic smile; 10 Or sat enthroned upon some broidered bank (The lowlier flowers in wrecks around them thrown) Shadowed with roses rising rank on rank: And there, now wreathed, now leaning into one, They talked, and kissed, again and yet again, To please good Angels thus, and win good men. 11 Swift rolled the years. The boy now twelve years old, Vowed to the Cross and honourable war, For Palestine deserts our northland cold. Her husband—playmate—is he hers no more? Up to his hand, now timid first she crept,— ‘Farewell,’ he said: she sighed; he kissed her and she wept. 12 A milk-white steed; a crest whose snowy pride Like wings, or maiden tresses drooped apart; A Cross between; and (every day new dyed), Fair emblem on his shield, a bleeding heart, Marked him far off from all. Not mine to tell What fields his valour won, what foes before him fell. 13 No barbarous rage that host impelled; but zeal For Christian faith and sacred rites profaned; And Triumph smiled upon the avenging steel That smote the haughty and set free the chained. Foremost he fought. In Victory's final hour Star-bright he shone from Salem's topmost tower! 14 Swift as that Fame, which like an Angel ran Before him on a glory-smitten road, Homeward the princely boy returned, a man. A lovelier angel graced their old abode— But where his youthful playmate? where? half dazed, Each on the other's beauty wondering gazed. 15 Strange joy they found all day in wandering over The spots in which their childish sports had been; Husband and wife whilome, now loved and lover, A broken light brightened yet more the scene. Night came: a gay yet startled bride he led, Old rites scarce trusting, to the bridal bed. 16 No more remains of all this ancient story. They loved with love eternal: spent their days In peace, in good to man, in genuine glory: No spoils unjust they sought, nor unjust praise. Their children loved them and their people blessed— God grant us all such lives—in Heaven for aye such rest! QUEEN BERTHA'S MATIN SONG. The morning star was rising, O'er ocean's tremulous crystal hung; His bright feet touched the billow, His glance o'er earth he flung; On the young Queen he played; Yet warm and disarrayed, As, leaping lightly from her pillow, The golden harp she swayed. Hide not the clouds among, Brightest star, and fairest! Until her song those heavens along Between thy wings thou bearest. 1 ‘Thou that on my dreams All night long wert beaming, O'er shining leaves and silver streams Brighter now art gleaming; Every fountain hath Light thy keen smiles give her; In every bay-leaf's dewy bath Thy soft swift glances quiver.’ Hide not the clouds among, Brightest star and fairest! Until her song those heavens along Between thy wings thou bearest. 2 ‘Heaven doth laugh above, Earth below is gay, And souls that walk 'twixt light and love Shall walk in joy alway, White as yon lily sweet, That springs, while cold airs fan it, A virgin spouse her mate to greet In thee, glad matin Planet!’ Hide not the clouds among, Brightest star and fairest! Until her song those heavens along Between thy wings thou bearest. 3 ‘All the starry hosts, And all the angelic band, At once o'er all the ethereal coasts Leaped forth at God's command; But surely from afar 'Twas thee men saw on high, When darkness fled before the star Of Christ's Nativity.’ Hide not the clouds among Brightest star and fairest! Until her song those heavens along Between thy wings thou bearest. 4 ‘When the earth was made Stars and angels sang; When Christ was in the manger laid More loud the anthem rang; But louder yet those choirs The last great morn shall blend Their heavenly songs and heavenly fires, While thou dost last ascend.’ Hide not the clouds among, Brightest star and fairest! Until her song those heavens along Between thy wings thou bearest. QUEEN BERTHA'S ALMS. 1 Glad as that thrill some princely birth With hushed yet rapturous omen gracing The stir, as from her palace forth The young fair Queen came pacing. But here no pompous guard was set; No flattering concourse gathered round: The poor about her gate were met: The readiest place the poorest found. 2 Like youthful angels, all alert The Queen dispensed her bounteous load; On those whom keenest fates had hurt, Her earlier gifts bestowed. Her face the maniac's rage beguiled; She turned her now among the ring, And paused, above a poor blind child, The sweetest of her songs to sing! 3 Kind gifts to some, kind words to more; Kind looks to each and all she gave, Which on with them through life they bore, And down into their grave. Around her feet the children crept, And kissed the grass those feet had trod; Sad eyes that many a year had wept, With tears of gladness gemmed the sod. 4 The chiming of the convent bells Called her at last away to prayer: Farewell she smiled on their farewells— And turned; when, unaware, An old gray man with hands outspread She marked low-bent on quivering knee: Over his brow she stooped and said, ‘A kiss is all I have for thee.’ QUEEN BERTHA AT HER VESPERS. 1 Half kneeling yet, and half reclining, She held her harp against her knees: Aloft the ruddy roofs were shining, And sunset touched the trees. From the gold border gleamed like snow Her foot: a crown enriched her brow: Dark gems confined that crimson vest, Close-moulded on her neck and breast. 2 In silence lay the cloistral court, And shadows of the convent towers: Well ordered now in stately sort Those royal halls and bowers. The coral chaunt had just swept by— Bright arms lay quivering yet on high: Thereon the warriors gazed, and then Glanced lightly at the Queen again. 3 While from her lip the wild hymn floated, Such grace in those uplifted eyes, And sweet, half absent looks, they noted That, surely, through the skies They deemed a Spirit floated ever Upon that song's perpetual river, And, smiling from its joyous track, Upon her heavenly face looked back. QUEEN BERTHA'S VIGIL. 1 Beneath and round her queenly bower So tall the garden pageants grew, With every breeze each moon-lit flower Was waved the casement through: White in the radiance glanced the fawn; Flitted the hare from lawn to lawn; By close, broad firs, that flecked the sheen, And barred with black the silver green. 2 Far off, like mighty cliffs, their shade Over a waste of waves that cast, The castle walls o'er wood and glade Flung down their darkness vast. Answering a monarch's joyous call, Far realms were met in festival: There flocked the noble and the fair— The fairest, noblest was not there. 3 And yet for her no flowers were blowing: No listening dell or vale profound Enjoyed her breath: for her was flowing Nor glassy stream, nor stream of sound: In vain her song the night-bird squandered: The winds that through her chamber wandered And o'er her pillow brushed screne, But found the place where she had been! 4 The Moon, whose glory swelled with light Each lilied slope and laurelled mound, With touch more sharp and exquisite, Defined one rock cross-crowned. Like argent flames or spires of frost Uprose that shape of stone, embossed With breeze-worn sculptures quaint and mild Of Maid and Angel, King and Child. 5 There on her knees the Queen was praying: On that cold marble leaned her breast; Prayer after prayer devoutly saying, With palms together pressed. There for her lord she prayed aloud, Prayed for her people, blind and proud— That Heaven would chase away their night, That God would bathe his heart in light! THE SOUL'S WASTE. 1 Couldst thou but keep each noble thought Thou fling'st in words away, With quiet then thy night were fraught, With glory crowned thy day. But thou too idly and too long From bower to bower hast ranged; And Nature, trifled with, not loved, Will be at last avenged. 2 With pleasure always, ne'er with awe, Thou gazest on the skies: And from thy lips all zephyrs draw Their amplest harmonies. Beware! the hour is coming fast, When every warbled tone, That brims our heart with joy, shall yield No sweetness to thine own. GOOD AND EVIL. Angel! beneath whose steadfast wings The Earth revolves her wanderings; Behold, that ancient nurse of man Is wearied, withered, palsied, wan. A serpent o'er her bosom crept: A serpent stung her while she slept: A serpent's poison taints her blood. Therefore their wisdom mocks the wise: Corruption near perfection lies: Ill ends the work that well began— Wave once thy mighty wings, and fan The Evil from the Good! A TRAVELLER'S GRACE. Take, pretty birds—to you these crumbs are given— Your portion of our meal ere yet begun: And waft our thanks in melody to Heaven Should we forget them, when that meal is done. SONG. 1 Her sable tresses swelled more bright: New beams her dark eyes flung: Upon her purple vest the light Changed, shifting with her song. Her breath like flame, now went, now came: Strange joy her pulses shook: While face and form gleamed wild and warm, Like a bather's from a brook. 2 She sang the Martyrs of the Faith! As loud as Angel choirs She sang the songs which they in death Hurled, fire-like, through their fires! But now more slow her murmurs flow: Her smiles serenely play, Like light on leaves a breath upheaves, Upheaves to meet the day. THE SOLITARY. 1. A sad Thought came there to my breast, And said, ‘I walk the world unblest; I pray thee, let me be thy guest. ‘Each heart is full of its own care; To me no space it deigns to spare; A generous grief not one will bear. ‘The orb of earth like night I roam: But never found I yet a home; Therefore at last to thee I come.’ 2. I let him in—for youth is kind; Nor dare I call its prompture blind; Though bitter fruits remain behind. He stayed a day with me; and then I could not let him go again; I said, ‘Abide a week or twain.’ All day he sang; all night he kept His vigil near me as I slept; Thus on into my heart he crept. 3. He said, ‘If thou my lore wilt know, And bear my heavenly pain below, Then thou shalt taste no baser woe. ‘And, careless of thy proper weal, Thou for thy suffering race shalt feel Deep pity and eternal zeal. ‘And, dwelling in thy place alone, Thou shalt look down, thyself unknown, Upon all knowledge round thee strown.’ 4. O Lady! turn those eyes away; For when their beams upon me play, The whole wide world grows blank and gray. Disturb not thou a lonely fate; A milder beauty is my mate, And I to her am dedicate. Pass onward, beautiful as morn! Pass on, and shine on hearts forlorn; Pass on from me—but not in scorn. 5. In thee collecting all her gleams, As from a centre Beauty beams; I catch that light on leaves and streams. In waving boughs and winding shells, The grace of all thy movement dwells: From all the birds thy music wells. In thought familiar thus with thee, Thine outward form I will not see; It jars upon my reverie. 6. Nay, oft from lifeless shapes around My dazzled eyeballs seek the ground, And my heart beats with awe profound. I sit upon the dull gray shore, And hear the infinite waters roar. One mournful sound for evermore. I lean upon a rock my breast; I love its coldness, heart oppressed; I love its hardness, and its rest. SONG. 1 When I was young, I said to Sorrow, ‘Come, and I will play with thee:’— He is near me now all day; And at night returns to say, ‘I will come again to-morrow, I will come and stay with thee.’ 2 Through the woods we walk together; His soft footsteps rustle nigh me; To shield an unregarded head, He hath built a winter shed; And all night in rainy weather, I hear his gentle breathings by me. SONG. 1 She says, ‘Poor friend, you waste a treasure Which you can ne'er regain, Time, health, and glory, for the pleasure Of toying with a chain.’ But then her voice so tender grows, So kind and so caressing, Each murmur from her lip that flows Comes to me like a blessing. 2 Sometimes she says, ‘Sweet friend, I grieve you— Alas, it gives me pain! What can I? Ah, might I relieve you, You ne'er had mourned in vain!’ And then her little hand she presses Upon her heart, and sighs; While tears, whose source not yet she guesses Grow larger in her eyes. 3 Sigh, sigh no longer, gentle Maiden! For me no longer droop: To one so poor, so sorrow-laden They ne'er can let thee stoop. Love ne'er can place thy hand in mine, Thou art so high above me: Yet might I plead with eyes like thine I think that thou wouldst love me! LINES. You drop a tear for those that die: To me, yet living, grant a sigh. Surely they rest: no rest have I. The sighing wind dies on the tree. I cannot sigh: sigh thou for me. The broken heart is sadly free. You bid me say what I would have: Will one flower serve? or do I crave A wreath—to decorate a grave? Fling poppies on the grave of Youth: Fling pansies on the tomb of Truth: On mine to-morrow morn fling both. All day I sat below your gate, My spirit calmed by its own weight; Then Sorrow grew importunate. I rose, and on the steps I writ These fragments of a wildered wit: To be erased beneath your feet. Erase them, haughty feet—I live! I wished, not hoped, that you might grieve. You can forget: ah then, forgive! UNA. A ‘lovely fear,’ a sweet solicitude For others' grief is hers; skilled are her fingers To cool with dewy flowers the front of care, Flattering to pleasant tears the over-worn. She lives in her sweet maidenhood, untouched By doubt, distrust, or pain; and gives to Heaven Her heart, to earth her pity, to her friends The snow-fed fountains of her fresh affections; Seldom she weeps, and never causes tears; Her looks are gentle, and her voice as low As morning winds that spare the trembling dewdrops; Her hand is lighter than a young bird's wing. You deem her undefended. She is strong! A glorious Spirit zoned with power and beauty! The pure are always strong; for they possess Youth's heaven-taught lore, and Virtue's might eterne: And, as the ocean in the flowers of ocean, So God within them dwells, and moves around. IN VIA. 1 Our vale of Life at either end Is spanned by gates of gold; And when the breeze against them strains Such harmony is rolled From every echoing valve and bar Right on through all the vale afar, That cliffs, and woods, the air, the ground, With rapture tremble in the sound. 2 This Earth is not so far from Heaven: Bright angels from the skies, Seen or unseen, it matters not, Descend; and prayers uprise. Deep Sabbath of the trusting breast, The solstice of a realm of rest, Rich antepasts we have in thee Of glory and eternity! DE VIA. From North unto South, from the East unto the West, There is no rest; Wind sigheth unto wind, sea moaneth unto sea, ‘Not in me,’ And the loud waves that roar In the deep, and on the shore:— Never, till thou resteth in the green earth's breast, Shalt thou rest. SONNETS. TO MY SISTER THESE SONNETS ARE DEDICATED. I. TO COLERIDGE. Written in early youth. As one who lies, when day is almost done, Rocked in a little boat upon a sea Whose glassy billows heave eternally Albeit the winds are lulled, watching the sun That sinks behind those billows, and anon Uprises, while the orange gleams that dye The long, low windows of the western sky Are imaged in the waters smooth and wan; Coleridge! thus hang we on the mystic traces Of that one Thought which feeds thy soul with light; Thus falls the ‘Idea of the Infinite’ Dazzling our spirit-eyes, and up-turned faces; Thus sinks, and reappears, and mocks our sight, Absorbed once more in the great deep's embraces. II. TO E.—1. Written in early youth. Sweet tears commingling with our youthful smiles Made them more balmy in life's happy dawn: Ah, friend belovèd, whither is it gone, That power whose infant tenderness beguiles Our childhood's sorrows with its lovely wiles? Still lies the dew upon our own green lawn; The peaceful gleam can never be withdrawn From yon dim lake, and all its glistening isles: Yet on all these how vainly do we gaze Seeking for something nowhere to be found; And in the wind we listen for a sound That now is buried with departed days; And wonder at the smiles that strangely pass Over the tears that lie on either wildered face. III. TO E.—2. No more, O never more in wood, or wold, Mountain, or ocean's many-coloured plain, Or in the manners or the minds of men, Shall we the ancient loveliness behold. An apathetic languor, calm and cold, Hangs upon all things with a cast of pain; And a community of self-disdain Is all the young inherit from the old. Earth, full of years, and in old age forlorn, Laments the dewy beauty of her prime, Laments with tears, and would of thee implore A restoration, unrestoring Time! A restoration of her glorious morn, And Love which, once rejected, comes no more. IV. TO E.—3. Sorrow and joy mature the growth of love: Love, nursed by joy alone, is poor and weak: 'Tis not that we together sought and seek Those streams of song whose fountains are above; It is not kindred minds alone which move In us a love that must for aye endure; Nor kindred hopes that blend in rhythm pure, Nor charm of childish memories interwove, Nor those sweet names of sister and of brother, Alone; the grave endears us to each other; The mournful separation which must come When eyes wax dim, and fondest lips are dumb:— We love the golden calm before the storm, And turn to clasp once more the hand which yet is warm. V. TO E.—4. The ocean murmurs on his circling shores— Where is the ear that catches as a whole That never-ceasing sound from pole to pole? The sun upon a thousand empires pours At once his beams in unexhausted stores; But who—what mortal eye, what human soul, Beholds that light on all those empires roll, And on the intermediate ocean floors? We see but the detail of things; too near We stand to comprehend their harmony: Hereafter happy in some nobler state Of being we shall turn and contemplate The moral planet of Humanity In the bright fulness of its perfect sphere. VI. ART AND SCIENCE. A wild swan and an eagle side by side I marked, careering o'er the ocean-plain, Emulous a loftier zenith each to gain, Circling in orbits wider and more wide: Highest, methought, through tempest scarce descried, One time the bird of battle soared;—in vain; So soon, exhausted 'mid their joy and pride, Dropp'd the bright rivals, vanquished, to the main. Then, o'er the mighty waves around them swelling, That snowy nursling of low lakes her song Lifted to God, floating serene along; While she that in the peaks had made her dwelling Struggled in vain her wings to beat and quiver, And the sea closed o'er that bright crest for ever. VII. TO POWER. Where art thou? In the winds when they awake Man's soul, and with their sevenfold harmonies Admonish him from regions far, and break The frozen trance in which his spirit lies. Where art thou? In all Nature while her hues Sink into Man's deep spirit; thence to rise In branching thoughts, as evening's buried dews Emerge from earth in flowers of heavenly dyes. Where art thou? With the Muse when she is raising Unto the Poet's ear her unseen shell, Which charms to movements smooth with potent spell The Visions from his brain their progress tracing! There—not in battle-fields—O Power, thou art— An Eagle brooding o'er the world's wide heart. VIII. A tranced beauty dwells upon her face, A lustrous summer-calm of peace and prayer; In those still eyes the keenest gaze can trace No sad disturbance, and no touch of care. Peace rests upon her lips, and forehead fair, And temples unadorned. A cloistral grace Says to the gazer over-bold, ‘Beware,’ Yet love hath made her breast his dwelling-place. An awful might abideth with the pure, And theirs the only wisdom from above. She seems to listen to some strain obscure Of music in sidereal regions wove, Or to await some more transcendent dower From heaven descending on her like a dove. IX. She sat amid a soft-eyed company Of little children, whom she taught to love That God who deigned a child on earth to move,— And, loving Him, to fear. Hand, lip, and eye, And many a smile and sometimes a short sigh Were beautiful to incite and to reprove; And with that holier wisdom from above Enlarge our sorrowful humanity. And yet, O blameless, and thyself a child! How canst thou teach? Thy rosy lips make sweet The faults they fain would chide! Of all that group The timidest such wrath as thine would meet Gladly, if so that dovelike hand might droop Upon her shoulder or her tresses wild. X. Happy are they who kiss thee, morn and even, Parting the hair upon thy forehead white: For them the sky is bluer and more bright, And purer their thanksgivings rise to Heaven. Happy are they to whom thy songs are given; Happy are they on whom thy hands alight: And happiest they for whom thy prayers at night In tender piety so oft have striven. Away with vain regrets and selfish sighs— Even I, dear friend, am lonely, not unblest: Permitted sometimes on that form to gaze, Or feel the light of those consoling eyes: If but a moment on my cheek it stays I know that gentle beam from all the rest! XI. She whom this heart must ever hold most dear, This heart in happy bondage held so long, Began to sing. At first a gentle fear Rosied her countenance, for she is young, And he who loves her most of all was near: But when at last her voice grew full and strong, O! from their ambush sweet, how rich and clear Leaped the bright notes abroad—a rapturous throng! Her little hands were sometimes flung apart, And sometimes palm to palm together prest; While wave-like blushes rising from her breast Kept time with that aerial melody; A music to the sight !—I standing nigh Received the falling fountain in my heart. XII. Flowers I would bring if flowers could make thee fairer, And music, if the Muse were dear to thee; (For loving these would make thee love the bearer) But sweetest songs forget their melody, And loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer:— A rose I marked, and might have plucked; but she Blushed as she bent, imploring me to spare her, Nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry. Alas! and with what gifts shall I pursue thee, What offerings bring, what treasures lay before thee; When earth with all her floral train doth woo thee, And all old poets and old songs adore thee; And love to thee is nought; from passionate mood Secured by joy's complacent plenitude! XIII. Let me be near thee, and I will not touch Thy hand; or grieve thee with reproach or praise; Or look into thine eyes. Is this too much? Sweet Lady, say not so, for I would gaze On thee for ever. Be but what thou art, A Beauty shrined within a silver haze; And in the silence let me fill my heart With memories calmly stored for wintry days. O Lady! there is sorrow here below; And gladness seldom comes, and cannot last: Thou art all summer: thou wilt never know The cold and cloudy skies which I forecast: Deny not thou long years of future woe Their comfort sad and sole—a happy Past. XIV. You say the Past is dead. It cannot die: Life makes immortal what it breathes upon. Last night, whilst I was slumbering restlessly, Dark Forms, attired like mourners, one by one, Drew near, and bound me with unaltered eye. They stood a long and melancholy train: At last I spake: ‘Ye ministers of Pain! I know you, and your aspect stern and high. Ye are the Phantoms of departed Hours.’ They sank; but sent, instead, a dense array Of shadows gathered from their dreariest bowers— Forms, faces, scenes forgotten many a day, That seemed before my eyes to reel and swim, Like objects seen through sounding harp-strings dim. XV. Silence and Sleep, and Midnight's softest gloom! Consoling friends of fast deelining years; Benign assuagers of unfruitful tears; Soft-footed heralds of the wished-for tomb! Go to your master Death, the Monarch whom Ye serve; whose majesty your grace endears; And in the awful hollows of his ears Murmur, O ever murmur,—‘Come, O come!’ Virginal rites have I performed full long, And all observance worthy of a bride. Then wherefore, Death, dost thou to me this wrong, So long estranged to linger from my side? Am I not thine? O breathe upon my eyes A gentle answer, Death, from thine Elysian skies! XVI. Pause, lovely Lady, pause: with downward eye Regard this humble tomb awhile; and read The name of him who loved you well, now freed From pains of love—Ah, mournful liberty! Sigh forth, too late, an unavailing sigh: And, if thy spirit be to pity moved, Pray that a ceaseless dream of her he loved Abide upon him everlastingly. Stay, lovely Lady, stay: O stay for hours: I feel thy tear-drops falling one by one. Yet do not stay, for grief and shame it were That tears should fall so fast from eyes so fair; And feet that scarcely bend the meadow flowers Linger so long upon the chilling stone. XVII. TO A SCEPTIC. How oft that haughty and far-flashing eye, Have I not seen thee to the wide heavens raise, Or on the dark earth root thy tyrannous gaze As on a scroll with piercing scrutiny! Great scorn it seemed and great indignity That aught should mock thy search:—and yet that haze Which veils the loftiest, deepest things, obeys, Be sure, the cloud-compelling Power on high. Our life is finite—let the mind be so; And therefore bound the Spirit's appetites: Some things we cannot, some we should not know; Wisdom there is that weakens, lore that blights— He too that walks among the eternal lights Casts, as He moves, His shadow oft below! XVIII. A CHURCHYARD.—1. It stands a grove of cedars vast and green, Cathedral-wise disposed, with nave and choir, And cross-shaped transept lofty and serene; And altar decked in festival attire With flowers like urns of white and crimson fire; And chancel girt with vine-trailed laurel screen; And aisles high arched with cypresses between; Retreats of mournful love, and vain desire. Within the porch a silver fount is breathing Its pure, cold dews upon the summer air: Round it are blooming herbs, and flowers, the care Of all the angels of the Seasons, wreathing Successively their unbought garniture Round the low graves of the beloved poor. XIX. A CHURCHYARD.—2. But when the winds of night begin to move Along the murmuring roofs, deep music rolls Through all the vaults of this Cathedral grove; A midnight service for departed Souls. Piercing the fan-like branches stretched above Each chapel, oratory, shrine, and stall Then a pale moonshine falls or seems to fall On those cold grave-stones—altars reared by love For a betrothal never to be ended; And on the slender plants above them swinging; And on the dewy lamps from these suspended; And sometimes on dark forms in anguish clinging, As if their bosoms to the senseless mould Some vital warmth would add—or borrow of its cold. XX. TO?. Armoury of impenetrable mail Is thine; and hath been ever from the womb: Loosen not, till thou loosenest for the tomb The sevenfold harness of that iron scale: For many are there watchful to assail The mighty, and to speed the flying doom In all those fits of weakness or of gloom Which o'er the loftiest head at times prevail. Not only Passion's Furies—Jealousies, The heart's Hell-fires; Suspicion, Fear, and Hate: But Languors unheroic; Sympathies That, promising to soften, enervate; Desires that over earth and ocean roam; And Love, which here beneath should never make her home. XXI. FAME. Aspiring souls! henceforward without blame Revere in faith, and fearlessly obey That generous impulse which inspires your way: Glory your spur may be, though not your aim. Love hath its archetype, nor less hath Fame In Heaven; there shines the light whereof one ray Is Fame below: re-echoed thence for aye, Spread the great echoes of God's sacred Name. God's living Words through all the worlds sent forth, Support those worlds by them ordained and made: True Glory is God's sentence, rightly weighed: His Lips establish all things: and His Eyes Kindle the universal sacrifice, And everlasting, of the Heavens and Earth! XXII. TO A JUST LAWYER (EDWARD O'BRIEN). Author of “The Lawyer.” This sonnet was addressed to my dear early friend, Edward O'Brien, on the publication of his work, ‘The Lawyer,’ (Pickering.) Defrauded Justice, long a wanderer driven From Law, her Temple, holy kept of old, Though now the money-changers' strongest hold, Invoked not vainly aid from thee: and Heaven To thee that voice heroical hath given Wherewith to all thy brethren thou hast called, Standing alone among them disenthralled, All chains of custom, fear, and interest riven. Young Priest of Justice, what was their reply? ‘Justice herself this human sacrifice Requires: if thou wouldst serve her, rob and lie, So keeps the State function and equipoise’— Such answer thou didst scorn; and hast for this, Attained, fully to see its utter hollowness. XXIII. Virgin from Fame, and widowed of his Love, As for life's baser objects all too high, He lived alone, and fixed a steadfast eye On the fair prospects of the world above. Over earth's foreground poor of hill and grove The streams of sunset, and the starry sky He watched; and he had heard that harmony Which Spirits leave behind where'er they move. Men said he was a Visionary. True: He was such, for the deep and precious things Most real, ever stood before his view: His tendency was upward: without wings His sympathies ascended—yet below Where Duty called him, he was prompt to go. XXIV. Blessed is he who hath not trod the ways Of secular delights, nor learned the lore Which loftier minds are studious to abhor: Blessed is he who hath not sought the praise That perishes, the rapture that betrays; Who hath not spent in Time's vainglorious war His youth; and found, a schoolboy at fourscore, How fatal are those victories which raise Their iron trophies to a temple's height On trampled Justice; who desires not bliss, But peace; and yet when summoned to the fight, Combats as one who combats in the sight Of God, and of His Angels, seeking this Alone, how best to glorify the right. XXV. THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY. A cedar-cone from Carmel! stored with seeds Which, might they ripen in the sun and dew Of our ungenial West, ere long would strew Our desolate mountains, and o'er-shade our meads With forests such as earth no longer feeds! Could man once more that primal growth renew Then God's immortal breeze would wander through Their midnight boughs—that vital spirit which breeds Life without end. And be it known to you, Ye who would build, that with this wood alone, Sacred, eternal, incorruptible, That House in which the Holy One will dwell Must shape her chambers; and with blocks of stone As noiselessly raised up as those great forests grew. XXVI. THE SPIRITUAL TIES REHEARSED IN THE NATURAL. Father!—the childless Angels cannot call Upon their God, by that most sacred name! Brother!—the seed of Adam, one and all, With Christ Himself true brotherhood we claim. King, Prophet, Priest! the whole predestined frame Of life in one symbolic mould is cast; To prove of Heaven a mystic antepast, And a pure language to reveal the same. But we have scorned that old and simple life; And, building social Babels, fain to reach Yea storm high Heaven itself, through hate and strife Confused that Catholic and Godlike speech: Therefore God's face is dark as in a glass To us: the Patriarchs saw Him face to face. XXVII. ‘THE FLESH IS WEAK.’ What man can hear sweet sounds and dread to die? O for a music that might last for ever Abounding from its sources like a river Which through the dim lawns streams eternally! Virtue might then uplift her crest on high, Spurning those myriad bonds that fret and grieve her; Then all the powers of Hell, rebuked, would quiver Before the ardours of her awful eye. Alas for Man with all his high desires, And inward promptings fading day by day! High-titled honour pants while it expires; And clay-born glory turns again to clay. Low instincts last: our great resolves pass by Like winds whose loftiest pæan ends but in a sigh. XXVIII. THE DYING PLATONIST. Fain would I call that night which spreads so fast Out of the vault of Death's abysmal skies, A gentle gloom like that of thy dark eyes: Fain would I say that we, like children, cast Our blind-fold faces with a timid haste Into a mother's lap—ere long to rise Some little forfeit and some sweet surprise The playful future of a playful past. But ah! it is not so. Reality Makes a dread language of this ebbing breath; Preaching those awful homilies of Death Which sound so like each other at their close. The least of Sins is Infinite: it throws A shade into the face of the Most High. XXIX. RELIGIOUS LITERATURE. Stranger! yet friend! who from the ways unblest Of common life retired, art pleased to rove The autumnal alleys of this ‘Golden Grove,’ A work of Jeremy Taylor's bears this title. By woodland odours, sportive gleams carest, That lure thee forward in thine easy quest Of Wisdom bowered with Beauty and with Love; Beware! a presence that thou deemest not of Is here concealed. From out the air-rocked nest Of every leaf, looks forth some Dream divine: The grass thou treadest—the weeds, are cyphered o'er With mystic traces, and sibylline lore: Each branch is precious as that golden bough Hung by Æneas, ere he passed below, Upon the sable porch of Proserpine. XXX. RELIGIOUS ANTIQUARIANISM. I saw a wild-swan flying toward the West, Following the traces of a sunken Sun: The sky grew momently more pale; yet on She urged her indefatigable quest; Faint crimson lights suffusing still that breast, Out of whose deep recesses forth she flung Exhausted wailings of immortal song, Wind-scattered dirges, psalmody unblest! Sad lover of the Past! in vain that flight! A law there is that bids the earth roll round, And marvellously marries day and night, The first, and last. Yet drop not to the ground! Once more the orb thou lovest on thee shall rise, Far-shining from the East of thine abandoned skies. XXXI. STORM AND STABILITY. Now, now, ye kings and rulers of the earth, Lift up your eyes unto the hills eterne, Whence your salvation comes. From Earth's dark urn The great floods burst! From each ancestral hearth Look forth ye bold and virtuous poor, look forth: The meteor signs of woes to come discern; And whence the danger be not slow to learn: Then greet it with loud scorn, and warlike mirth. The banner of the Church is ever flying! Less than a storm avails not to unfold The Cross emblazoned there in massy gold— Away with doubts and sadness, tears and sighing: It is by faith, by patience, and by dying, That we must conquer, as our sires of old! XXXII. THE BEATIFIC VISION OF THE EARTH.—1. Glad childhood's dream of marvels past, we rise, Still on our cheeks the flush of sleep remaining; And roam the waste of Earth, our eyelids straining The glories of that dream to realise. Nor seek in vain. Stream, bird, or cloud replies, Echoes that mock young passion's amorous feigning, Fancy shines starlike forth 'mid daylight waning, And Hope the night-bird sings 'neath shrouded skies. At last the charm is broken: day by day Drops some new veil, until the countenance bare Of that ice-idol, blank Reality, Confronts us full with cold, and loveless eye— Then dies our heart, unless that faith we share Whose touch makes all things gold, and gives us youth for aye. XXXIII. THE BEATIFIC VISION OF THE EARTH.—2. Hail Earth, for man's sake cursed, yet blessing man! The Saviour trod thine herbage, breathed thine air: Henceforward, not alone through symbols, fair, Thou showest, delivered from thine ancient ban, Memorial bloom withheld since death began: Thy Maker's glory formed at last to share Even now that light transfiguring thou dost wear For us, which once adorned His forehead wan. ‘All things are new.’ O sing it, heavenly choirs! And ye, the choir of God's great Church below, The Poets! sound it on your deep-toned lyres: From every mountain-top the tidings blow: ‘All things are new.’ The Earth hath thrown aside Her mourning weeds, and sits a pale, and veilèd bride. XXXIV. THE BEATIFIC VISION OF THE EARTH.—3. Cowering beneath a semilucid veil, A semilucid bridal veil of snow, Which from the wreath that binds her temples pale Down to her white and slender feet doth flow, She sits. I hear her breathings soft and low: They shake the vine-leaves in that garland frail— Like Mary's when she heard th' Angelic ‘Hail,’ Dimly I see her blushes come and go. And now, that veil thrown back, her head she raises, Fixing upon the stars her starlike eyes: As though she felt that Heaven on which she gazes Her bosom rises: lo! her hands, they rise: She also rises. Time it is to meet Her Lord, and bless ‘the light of His returning feet.’ XXXV. THE CONSTELLATION OF THE PLOUGH. Type of celestial labour, toil divine, That nightly downward from the glistening skies Showerest thy light on these expectant eyes, Around thee in their stations ever shine Full many a radiant shape and emblemed sign, Swords, sceptres, crowns, bright tresses, galaxies— Whatever Song can raise, or Thought devise, Yet none, methinks, so truly great as thine. On, ever on! while He who guides thee flings His golden grain along the azure way Do thou thy sleepless work, and toiling, say, ‘O men, so sedulous in trivial things, Why faint amid your loftier labours? Why Forget the starry seed and harvests of the sky?’ XXXVI. HUMAN LIFE. Sad is our youth, for it is ever going, Crumbling away beneath our very feet; Sad is our life, for onward it is flowing, In current unperceived because so fleet; Sad are our hopes, for they were sweet in sowing, But tares, self-sown, have overtopped the wheat; Sad are our joys, for they were sweet in blowing; And still, O still, their dying breath is sweet: And sweet is youth, although it hath bereft us Of that which made our childhood sweeter still; And sweet our life's decline, for it hath left us A nearer Good to cure an older Ill; And sweet are all things, when we learn to prize them Not for their sake, but His who grants them or denies them. XXXVII. FORTITUDE. Man's mind should be of marble, not of clay: A rock-hewn temple, large, majestic, bare; Not decked with gewgaws, but with life-long care And toil heroic shaped to stand for aye: Not like those plaster baubles of the day, In which the lightest breath of praise or prayer Crumbles the gauds wherewith they garnished are: In which we dare not think, and cannot pray; In which God will not dwell. O Constancy! Where thou art wanting all our gifts are naught! Friend of the martyrs—both of those who die, And those who live—beneath that steadfast eye The breast-plates and the beaming helms were wrought Of all our far-famed Christian chivalry! XXXVIII. MEDITATION. What is more glorious than a noble Thought? What is more blessed?—In that thought to dwell! To build your bower within it; scoop a cell; Inlay with precious ores a secret grot With mossy seats around: to wander not; But lean in peace above its caverned well, Passive to that pure runnel's murmuring spell, Or sound of sighing forests heard remote. Such holy promptings moved of old our sires Those vast cathedrals cruciform to raise Which make us dwell within the Cross: and still, Sweet as the gradual breeze from all their choirs Moving with dawning day o'er wood and hill, The thoughts by those grey Minsters quickened to God's praise! XXXIX. SORROW. Count each affliction, whether light or grave, God's messenger sent down to thee; do thou With courtesy receive him; rise and bow; And, ere his shadow pass thy threshold, crave Permission first his heavenly feet to lave; Then lay before him all thou hast: Allow No cloud of passion to usurp thy brow, Or mar thy hospitality; no wave Of mortal tumult to obliterate The soul's marmoreal calmness: Grief should be, Like joy, majestic, equable, sedate, Confirming, cleansing, raising, making free; Strong to consume small troubles; to commend Great thoughts, grave thoughts, thoughts lasting to the end. XL. EVANESCENCE OF THE PATRIARCHAL RELIGION. Hermes! unearthly were those melodies That closed the lids of Argus! one by one His hundred orbs, by a sweet force pressed down, Yielding successively, like Heaven's bright eyes When moonlight spreads along her glistening skies: Smiling he sank, more pleased the more undone, Inebriate, while through those thin lids the sun Shone warmly without light!—thy sorceries, Faith of the Pagan world, so fair of old, Worked like those songs! Procession, Legend, Rite, Sapped thus transmitted Truth by spells of Art: Till the ever-waking spirit in man's heart Relinquished at the last its sacred hold Of God's prime creature, beatific Light! XLI. VIGILANCE. Virgin! at placid morn, and when the airs Of evening fan her flushed and throbbing sky, Send up, like doves, thy homeward thoughts on high, And mingle with those gentle thoughts thy prayers. Blameless thou art: but One there is who dares Assail for ever, and remorselessly The soul of finest grain and purest dye, And in the softest herbage sprinkles tares. Virgin! that Power which sends the winds of Even To rock the blossoms on the boughs of May, That Power the Spirits of the Mind obey, And come and go at His command alone: Yea, but for Him the loftiest star of Heaven Would drop, supplanted, from his glittering throne. XLII. PROVIDENCE. Providence is that thread on which are strung Like beads, all Acts and Epochs great and small, Where diamonds glitter at wide interval The sanguine and the sable gems among. ‘Wreathe it to one wide crown, and be it hung Henceforth aloft in Time's memorial hall, Suspend it o'er the symbol of the Fall;’ This is the burden of the angelic song. But we must live by Faith: waiting the time Solemnly set apart in God's great plan For joining the beginning and the ending: Then Truth and Love and Joy with choral blending Shall chaunt the mythic tale of Earth: then Man Shall mark the metre and recurrent rhyme. XLIII. UNIVERSAL HISTORY. Methought I gazed upon a dusky Round, Our mortal planet's monumental urn: Around its orb with many a spiral turn Ascending, a Procession slowly wound: There saw I laurelled poets, kings renowned; Prophets I saw from earth's remotest bourne: There saw I maids and youths, old men forlorn, And conquerors full-armed, and captives bound. A Funeral pomp methought it seemed far down In pale relief; and, side by side, therein Hooded, there paced, a Sorrow and a Sin: Midway in ampler ring, and vision clear, A Sacrifice embraced that mighty sphere: Above, a lovely Bridal was its crown. XLIV. TRUTH. Centre of Earth; keystone of Heaven's great dome! In thee the world's vast arches rest suspended: Within thy zodiac's belt round all extended The orb of Knowledge evermore doth roam: Thou art the lamp and hearth of each man's home— How many wondrous powers in thee are blended! By thee we live; by thee from death defended We find a second cradle in the tomb. In thee all good things breathe, without thee die: Strength, Justice, Loyalty, Truth's noble thrall, Song, Science, all the Loves; yea most of all, Though deemed too oft thy rival, Charity, Whose golden arrows swift as sunbeams fly, And scatter seeds of life where'er they fall! XLV. NATIONAL STRENGTH. What is it makes a Nation truly great? Her sons; her sons alone; not theirs, but they: Glory and gold are vile as wind and clay Unless the hands that grasp them, consecrate. And what is that in man by which a State Is clad in splendour like the noontide day? Virtue: Dominion ebbs, and Arts betray; Virtue alone endures. But what is that Which Virtue's self doth rest on; that which yields her Light for her feet, and daily, heavenly bread; Which from demoniac pride, and madness shields her, And storms that most assail the loftiest head? The Christian's humble faith; that faith which cheers The orphan's quivering heart and stays the widow's tears. XLVI. HONOUR. Bright and majestic Spirit! faithful mate Of all true Virtue, and that generous Fame Which guards a spotless, seeks a glorious name From Love not Pride; but seeks content to wait And prompt to share it: Angel of the State! Sanctioning Order with religious awe; Taking the harshness and the sting from Law, Scorn from the lowly, envy from the great: Come to this region of thine ancient sway! With thy heroic and inspiring smile Illume our perils and our fears beguile! Was it not here that Alfred built his throne, And high-souled Sidney waived a throne away?— The land is strong which thou hast made thine own. THE FALL OF RORA. (THE LAST SCENE OF A LYRICAL DRAMA WRITTEN IN YOUTH.) Caverned rocks in the mountains above Rora.—Chorus of Virgins and Wives—Old Men, Children. A GIRL. It thunders! AN OLD MAN. No, it is their meeting. A WOMAN. Ah! Thus far, beyond the sight of this great onset To wait the issue in suspense, and hear No sound, but those fierce shouts, and our hearts' beating! Hurl down, O wind, yon rocks! their jagged pines Leave half the vale exposed, yet hide the battle! SECOND WOMAN. A tenfold shout—now, now they meet. O heaven! CHORUS. Clouds above the dark vale streaming! Onward rushing, swift and free! Oh! that, as a mirror gleaming, You might show us all you see! Glittering heralds you should be Of a sun-bright victory! FIRST SEMI-CHORUS. Now the battle hosts are meeting; Tangled now in mazy error; Like whirlpools down a river fleeting— I am blind with doubt and terror. Better death, than doubt. O cease! Be still, my heart, or burst. Peace, peace! SECOND SEMI-CHORUS. Darkness and storm before him driven, Ascending ever high and higher, Yon Eagle cleaves the clouded heaven: Lo! now sun-smitten, like a pyre He burns! auspicious omen! we Behold our Fate and Fame in thee! FIRST GIRL. Have we judged well? SECOND GIRL. To give up all at once! The thought is glorious— WOMEN. But the act! woe, woe! FIRST SEMI-CHORUS. I heard a voice: the clouds were fled; All heaven hung vast and pure o'erhead; The mountain rock, and mountain sod, Lay steadfast, as the throne of God! I heard a voice: it spake to me, Far murmuring, ‘One hath died for thee, That thou shouldst live both just and free.’ SECOND SEMI-CHORUS. ‘For how,’ that deep voice murmured—‘how Shall man to God his forehead bow, If, bent beneath a Power unjust, For aye it grovel in the dust? Or how expand a chain-worn breast For Christ therein, an equal guest, To find his temple and his rest?’ FIRST WOMAN. Alas! and see you those poor children straying Still on, by cavern, brake, and rifted pine? They seek, but hope no more to find the maid. (Children pass through the caverns singing.) 1 We have sought her in her bower; In the garden we have sought her: In the forest, hour by hour, We have sought the chieftain's daughter. She that was to us so tender, Answer now she gives us none: She is gone we know not whither: If we knew where she is gone, We would gather flowers, and send her Those she loved, the last to wither. Agnes! our belovèd! come To thy children and thy home! 2 She was not like others, gay— But the mirthful loved her sadness: And the mourner oft would say, None could yield so soft a gladness. As a star, remote and lonely, Piercing depths of midnight woods, Makes the dark leaves dance in lightness; So into dejected moods, She, that mournful lady only, Shone with beams of heavenly brightness. Agnes, O belovèd! come To thy children and thy home! 3 O belovèd Agnes! where, Where art thou so long delaying? O'er what mountains bleak and bare Are thy tender feet a-straying? They have told us thou art taken To some palace white like snow; And some think that thou art sleeping This we know not; but we know, Every morning when we waken, All our lids are wet with weeping. O belovèd Agnes! come To thy children and thy home! CHORUS. Hark, hark the Storm! the voice not long Outstrips the Presence: see you now, Not leaves alone, but branch and bough! They roof the glen, a rushing throng, Fast borne in current fierce and strong: The cliffs that wall the vale are shaking: The forests to their heart are quaking: Crouch in caves who will: but I Exulting pace this platform high! My panting soul, with joy o'er-awed, I cast upon the storm abroad: And soon will hurl, inspired by wrong, Thereon my vengeance and my Song! A WOMAN. Is it the gasping of the storm That makes her wan cheek red and warm? Lo! how she fixes now her eyes— CHORUS. Catching the quickening impulse from those kindling skies! See, see the storm grows radiant now, As radiant as a lifted brow Too long abased! lo, fast and wide, Avenging Forms the tempest ride; And answer, round, above, and under, With choruses of rapturous thunder! Burst on the tyrant, Storm from God! Hurl them like leaves from rock to rock! Trample them down through clay and sod: From dark to dark!—their banners mock The purple and the blood-stained gold Thy clouds have righteously unrolled— A WOMAN. She lifts her hands, and far away Flings forth the ban! CHORUS. 1. For Tyrants say That men were shaped but to obey: Dead spokes alone, to roll and reel Within their car's revolving wheel! Let them take heed, for they have driven In frenzy o'er the rocky plain, Till earth's deep groans are heard in heaven, And fire bursts from those wheels amain. Not soon the stormy flames expire When hearts contagious in their ire Burst forth, like forests catching fire! 2. Or else this madness preys upon their spirit— That all good things to man's estate which fall Drop from their sacred prescience: they inherit Wisdom divine to nurse this mundane ball! Yea, they apportion times; with care dispensing The seasons; when to sow, what days for reaping, What space for food and labour, praying, sleeping; With stellar beams our harvests influencing; Forth from the heaven of high conceit diffusing Sunshine and breeze amid our murmuring grain; Showering the former and the latter rain— Or else with groans their vacant hours amusing, And sending forth a famine, to fulfil On men of froward heart the counsels of their will! Such airy dream to realise, All rights, all instincts they despise; On every heart they plant a foot, Importunate, impure, and brute: Round every bed a serpent creeps: They make along the venomed wall The hundred-footed Whisper crawl— But Vengeance in a moment leaps Forth from the frowning caverns of her noontide sleeps! FIRST WOMAN. How her high passion teems with thoughts as high; Like fire from Earth's deep heart quickening the seeds In some volcanic soil to stateliest growth! Flushed is her cheek with crimson as she cow'rs Beneath their umbrage! CHORUS. Ha! how well That Chief made answer. At the door The herald stood, and shook all o'er; And spake: ‘These tumults thou shalt quell; Or else, a deep oath I have sworn, Thy wife, the children of thy joy, With fire in vengeance to destroy.’ Then made he answer, without scorn: ‘Their flesh thou mayest consume; Time must: But I commend their spirits To God, in whom we trust.’ WOMEN. See, see that man! he's hurt—how goes the battle? MESSENGER. Thrice have they rushed upon us: thrice fled back: They form for the last onset. Arnold sent me— He prays you to remove. WOMEN. We will not stir! Why should we move? MESSENGER. The fight is worse than doubtful: Fresh troops are pouring on us—Christoval— Mario—the rest—have burst into the valley From every entrance. We are girt—surrounded— CHORUS. Smooth song no more; an idle chime! 'Tis ours, 'tis ours, ere yet we die, To hurl into the tide of Time The bitter Book of Prophecy. For ages we have fought this fight; For ages we have borne this wrong: How long, Holy and Just! how long, Shall lawless might oppress the right? No dreamy influence numbs my song! Too long suspended it has hung Like glaciers bending in their trance From cliffs, some hornèd valley's wall; One flash, from God one ireful glance, To vengeful plagues hath changed them all: Down, headlong torrents—'tis your hour Of triumph—on the Invading Power! Woe, woe to Tyrants! Who are they? Whence come they? Whither are they sent? Who gave them first their baleful sway O'er ocean, isle, and continent? Wild beasts they are, ravening for aye; Vultures that make the world their prey; Pests, ambushed in the noontide day; Ill stars of ruin and dismay; Tempestuous winds that plague the ocean: Hoar waves along some rock-strewn shore That rush and race, with dire commotion Raking those rocks in blind uproar! FIRST WOMAN. She sings aright: this music of her anger Makes my blood leap like founts from the warm earth: My chill is past. SECOND WOMAN. 'Tis well. We shall die free! CHORUS. As though this Freedom they demand of us Were ours, at will to keep or to bestow! To them a boon profane, a gift of woe; For us a loss fatal and blasphemous! This Freedom—man's dread Birthright of the Soul— It is not man's, nor under man's control: From God it comes; His prophet here, and martyr; Which when He gives to man, man's sword must guard: No toy for sport; no merchandise for barter; A duty, not a boast; the Spirit's awful ward!— Dread, sullen stillness, what art thou portending? Once more each word I mutter on mine ear, Forward in anguish bending, Drops resonant and clear— The forest wrecks, each branch and bough, O'er voiceless caves lie silent now: No sound, except the wind's far wail, Forth issuing through the portals of the vale, Now low, now louder and more loud, Under the bridge-like archway of yon low-hung cloud! FIRST WOMAN. O God, what light is that? See, see, it spreads! The vale is all one flame—the clouds catch fire— Our hearths, our homes! all lost—gone, gone, for ever! SECOND WOMAN. It wakes another tempest! From the gorges And deep glens on all sides the winds come rushing, And mate themselves unto that terrible flame, As we shake hands fiercely with our despair! Lo, once again that sound! that flame, behold! Once more it leaps off from its burning altar Up, up, to heaven— CHORUS. To be our witness there! A SECOND MESSENGER. Arnold is dead! He felt the wound was mortal: Then stood he up from slaying of his foes, And smiled, and gave this staff to me, and said: ‘If there be yet one free spot left on Earth, Let them plant there this staff— And there, not on my grave, remember me!’ FIRST SEMI-CHORUS. Boast not, haughty conqueror! Not from thee hath fallen this woe: He, the Lord of Peace and War, He alone hath laid us low. Boast not, haughty conqueror! Slay, but boast not. Woe! Woe! Woe! SECOND SEMI-CHORUS. From Heaven the curse was shaken On this predestined head: From thy hand the plague was taken; By a mightier vengeance sped. Mine is the sorrow, Mine, and for ever; Who can turn back again A mighty archer's arrow? Who can assuage my pain? Who can make calm my brain? Who can deliver? CHORUS. 1. But within me thoughts are rising, Severer thoughts, and soul-sufficing: Swift, like clouds in exhalation, Come they rushing: whilst a glory Falls on locks this fiery Passion Turns from black to hoary! Voices round me borne in clangour Sound the trump of things to be: And heavenly flashes of wise anger Give my spirit light to see The great Future; and aright Judge this judgment of to-night. 2. I trembled when the strife began— Praying, my clasped hands trembled With ill-timed weakness ill-dissembled But now beyond the strength of man, My strength has in a moment grown; And I no more my griefs deplore Than doth a shape of stone— A marble Shape, storm-filled, and fair With might resurgent from despair I walk triumphant o'er my woe: For well I feel and well I know, That God with me this wrong sustains, And, in me swelling, bursts my chains! 3. And dost thou make thy boast then of their lying All cold, upon the mountain and the plain, My Sons whom thou hast slain? And that nor tears nor sighing Can raise their heads again? My Sons, not vainly have ye died, For ye your Country glorified! Each moment as in death ye bowed On high your martyred Souls ascended; Yea, soaring in perpetual cloud, This earth with heaven ye blended— A living chain in death ye wove; And rising, raised our world more near those worlds above! 4. They perish idly? they in vain? When not a sparrow to the plain Drops uncared for! Tyrant! they Are radiant with eternal day! And oft, unseen, on us they turn Those looks that make us inly burn, And swifter through our pulses flow The bounding blood, their blood below! How little cause have those for fear Whose outward forms alone are here! How nigh are they to Heaven, who there Have stored their earliest, tenderest care! Whate'er was ours of erring pride, This agony hath sanctified: O'er us the storm hath passed, and we Are standing here immovably Upon the platform of the Right; And we are inwardly as bright As those last drops which hang like fire Close-clustered on the piny spire, When setting suns their glories pour On yellow vales perturbed no more; While downward from the eagle's wing One feather falls in tremulous ring, And far away the wearied storms retire. 5. I heard, prophetic in my dreams, The roaring of a million streams, While downward from their sources torn, Came pines and rocks in ruin borne: Then spake that Storm to me and said, ‘Quake thou with awe, but not with dread: For these are Thrones and Empires rolled Down Time's broad torrent, as of old: But thou those flowers remember well, By foaming floods in peace that dwell; For thus 'mid wrecks of fear and strife, Rise up the joys of hourly life; And all pure bonds and charities Exhale their sweetness to the skies— But woe to haughtier spirits! They, At God's command, are swept away, Into the gulfs that know not day.’ 6. And now my Song is sung. I go Far up to fields of endless snow: Alone till death I walk, unsoiled By air the tyrants have defiled. Over a cheek no longer pale I drop henceforth a funeral veil, And only dimmed and darkened see The mountains I have looked on free. Ye that below abide, unblest, Paint now no more with flowers your dells; Nor speak in tone like that which swells, Loud-echoed from the freeman's breast: In sable garments walk, and spread With cerements black your buried dead. Farewell to all: I go alone; And dedicate henceforth my days To muse on God's high Will, and raise My hands toward th' eternal Throne— And I beneath the stars will thread The dark beads of my rosaries; And ofttimes earth ward bow my head, And listen ofttimes for the tread Of some far herald, swiftly sent, To crown with light a shape time-bent, And dry a childless widow's eyes With tidings grave of high content, Wherein unheeded prophecies Shall find their great accomplishment! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. To the Memory OF SARA COLERIDGE THESE POEMS ARE DEDICATED. FEMALE POETRY. My little Poetess! whose eyes Not less than lips demand The lore of sounding harmonies— An almost infant hand Laying the while my chords among, Accept song-science in a song. 1. Fling far thy books! or only read Of fairy spell and knightly deed: Hating the pedant's learned strife Truth walks but in the walks of Life. Beside thy Mother watch and wait: Her wish, her thought anticipate. With kind, poetic insight guess The want yon Babe can not express. Be glad to play: and learn, each day, To love, believe, enjoy, obey! 2. Fling far thy books! thy leaves be those Famed Daphne's glittering laurel shows: For thee inscribed with words sun-bright, Blank tablets to the casual sight! Bend o'er yon stream, and o'er its sound Where sighs of Hylas are kiss-drowned. No kindly converse scorn or shun: The Muses danced on Helicon Enwreathed, and infant Love enwreathing— A God unwaked—yet softly breathing. 3. But when within thy deeper eyes The dawn of ripening Thought shall rise, And human sympathies have part With heavenlier yearnings in thy heart, Walk forth where Larks new-mounted sing, And catch their transports on thy string! Partake their joy; fit words supply: Interpret next yon Thrush hard by: Explore her deep heart, tone by tone: But touch not, lest thou taint, thine own! 4. No Epic swell, no Tragic rage Be thine: no war with Evil wage; But show the Good, and show the Fair; And launch light warblings on the air, Glassy and pure, as those that stole, Ere jarred by Love, through Psyche's soul! More subtle lore than man could reach With child-like instinct learn and teach: With airier touch entwined than ours The dew hang heavy from thy flowers! 5. Mimic not thou a manly strain; A woman's song in heart and brain Should woman be:—a coarser leaven Would dull that music-birth from heaven. Yon singing spheres have tones they ne'er Have deigned as yet with earth to share; Their Muse reserves that chime unknown For bosoms vestal as her own; From her, not alien models, learn To charm it from its native bourne. 6. Too rich in vulgarer notes, we crave The songs we lack, not those we have; Hope, Beauty, Truth, let thine express; Nor over-gay, nor mean their dress, But finely woven and lightly worn; No gems but those for service borne. Forth, happy Hymns from a full heart With natural impulse, simple art, But softly, when o'er sacred ground, As though you feared your own sweet sound! L'ENVOY. Chiron taught Thetis' boy to fight: A little, fearless Bard, A maid disguised I teach to write; And this be my reward— In minstrelsy of hers one day To clasp that beauteous, wilful Lay, Which oft its brow o'er mine inclined, Then, mocking, passed me in the wind! SONG.FIRST SHEPHERDESS. 1 Breath divine of morning odours! Breath of blossoms, breath of buds; Onward borne in wingèd chorus, Through the alleys and old woods: And thou stream, that, lightly flowing, Dost thy pretty mirth enforce; Flash, and laugh, and crystal ripple, Hurrying in perpetual course: O the joy to walk, low-singing, Through those blooming vales, and say Another morn hath dropped from heaven With our aged earth to play!SECOND SHEPHERDESS. 2 Phosphor, through my casement peeping, On my folded eyelids shone; ‘Wake,’ he sang, ‘no more of sleeping, Shadows melt, the night is gone:’ A bird that with the year is ripening, One brief moment wakes to pour Through the boughs wild jets of music, Then sinks in sleep once more. O the joy to walk, low-singing, Through those blooming woods, and say Another spring has stooped from heaven With our aged earth to play! SONG. Sing the old song, amid the sounds dispersing That burden treasured in your hearts too long; Sing it with voice low breathed, but never name her. She will not hear you, in her turrets nursing High thoughts, too high to mate with mortal song— Bend o'er her, gentle Heaven, but do not claim her! In twilight caves, and secret lonelinesses, She shades the bloom of her unearthly days; And the soft winds alone have power to woo her: Far off we catch the dark gleam of her tresses; And wild birds haunt the wood-walks where she strays, Intelligible music warbling to her. That Spirit charged to follow and defend her, He also, doubtless, suffers this love-pain; And she perhaps is sad, hearing his sighing: And yet that face is not so sad as tender; Like some sweet singer's when her sweetest strain From the heaved heart is gradually dying! SONG. 1 Slanting both hands against her forehead On me she levelled her bright eyes: My whole heart brightened as the sea When midnight clouds part suddenly; Through all my spirit went the lustre, Like starlight poured through purple skies. 2 And then she sang a loud, sweet music, Yet louder as aloft it clomb; Soft when her curving lips it left; Then rising till the heavens were cleft, As though each strain, on high expanding, Were echoed in a silver dome. 3 But, ah! she sings ‘she does not love me:’ She loves to say she ne'er can love: To me her beauty she denies, Bending the while on me those eyes Whose beams might charm the mountain leopard, Or lure Jove's herald from above! TO A WILD PANSY. Lone flower of many names, the wind sweeps o'er thee, Knowing thee not: tumultuous, vain, and wild, The mountain-torrent sounds and shines before thee; Yet droop not, little flower, for she who bore thee, The great Earth, careth for thee, And from her bosom mild Delights to feed thee like a newborn child. Flower on the Past's dark brow! I gaze upon thee Till my dim eyes are vacant as thine own: With labour I have sought, yet now I shun thee: Flower of sad Thought! thou art not mine alone;— Thou from my eyes art gone; And long-forgotten voices swell the strain Of that loud mountain-stream whose clamour stuns my brain! SONG. 1 Softly, O midnight Hours! Move softly o'er the bowers Where lies in happy sleep a girl so fair! For ye have power, men say, Our hearts in sleep to sway, And cage cold fancies in a moonlight snare. Round ivory neck and arm Enclasp a separate charm: Hang o'er her poised; but breathe nor sigh nor prayer: Silently ye may smile, But hold your breath the while, And let the wind sweep back your cloudy hair! 2 Bend down your glittering urns Ere yet the dawn returns, And star with dew the lawn her feet shall tread; Upon the air rain balm; Bid all the woods be calm; Ambrosial dreams with healthful slumbers wed. That so the Maiden may With smiles your care repay When from her couch she lifts her golden head; Waking with earliest birds, Ere yet the misty herds Leave warm 'mid the grey grass their dusky bed. LOVE AND SORROW. Wherever under bowers of myrtle Love, summer-tressed, and vernal-eyed, At morn or eve is seen to wander, A dark-eyed Girl is at his side. No eye beholds the Virgin gliding Unsandalled through the thicket's glooms; Yet some have marked her shadow moving Like twilight o'er the whiter blooms. A golden bow the Brother carries, A silver flute the Sister bears: And ever at the fatal moment The notes and arrows fly in pairs. She rests that flute upon her bosom While up to Heaven his bow he rears, And as her kisses make it tremble That flute is moistened by her tears. The lovely twain were born together, And in the same shell-cradle laid, By one sea-murmur lulled to slumber, Together slept, and sleeping played, With hands into each other's woven, And whispering mouths that seem to teach Each other in their rosy motion What still their favourites learn from each. Proud of her boy, the Mother showed him To mortal and immortal eye; But hid, because she loved her dearer, The deeper, sweeter Mystery. Accept them both, or hope for neither, Love-seeking Youth, or Maid love-lorn, For Grief has come when Love is welcome, And Love will comfort those who mourn. ODE ON LEAVING ITALY. (Written many years ago.) 1 Angels that with love ‘revere The gentle changes of the day,’ Thus solaced bend they o'er the bier Ausonia, of thy long decay? Thy large flower fading softly, slowly, Fan they, and fill with sighs as lowly As tender, and as deep as those The year on Summer's grave bestows; When hectic mounds of vaporous wood Extend for Autumn's cheek their cushion, And Heaven's own tears on boughs o'er-dewed Anoint them—‘for their dissolution?’ 2 Ah, would it were so! Death-bells tolled O'er graves like these no pangs awaken: Unguilty griefs are soon consoled, But thou in death art shaken By dreams in direful alternation Of action blind, and aimless passion, With hopes of future empire, based On noblest instincts run to waste. And worst of all, one sable pall Hangs o'er that dying couch suspended: Thyself, thou knowest, hast wrought thy fall— Thy tears with tears of blood are blended. 3 Death, that from none accepts denial, In reverence thrice his sceptre bowed; A triple life, a threefold trial, The Fates to thee allowed. Etrurian greatness gold had tamed Ere Mars his iron empire claimed: Then Rome arose; and like that God All lands, subdued and bleeding, trod. She sank:—Thy States, redeemed once more, Upreared to Heaven a smiling brow: Like flowers from chains of winter frore They rose: where lie they now? 4 Venice yet crowns the orb of waters, Why sinks she not beneath them? What Are now her sons? her beauteous daughters— Go, Stranger; name them not! Genoa, whose star-eyed Pilgrim gave Our world its mate beyond the wave, Scarcely retains on Europe's shore A name: her place is hers no more. Her choicest boon where Nature showers On thy blue bay, Parthenopè, There most corruption blights the bowers Of men too abject to be free. 5 Pisa to earth inclines her brow; Her ‘field of Death’ becomes her most: Sea-born Amalphi needs not now That compass, once her boast. The sunshine beats Ravenna's streets: That glare alone the traveller greets: Ferrara wakes her echoes lone In Tasso's wrong to sing her own: Bologna's arts, and Padua's schools, And sacerdotal Milan grey, Old Saturn rules, while Janus fools; And Momus ratifies their sway! 6 A wind-tossed wreath of odorous roses Against me borne in wanton play On lips and lyre their seal imposes:— I know what ye would say! Those haunts, I know, are sacred places, Loved of the Loves and all the Graces; And, wandering through those lucent bowers, To love them, not to judge, is ours. I love them—love in grief: and more While on those glorious souls I muse Wherewith surcharged they were of yore As ye, rich flowers, with morning dews! 7 Day after day at Rome I sate, Dejected sate, with brow low-bent, The vault of an abandoned gate O'er head my firmament. They muttered Freedom's queenly name: It stung my sadness into shame. The wise, the constant, Freedom calls; The rest she scourges from her halls! There Justice lifts her axe and rods; There all the Virtues take their stand, Sun-facing statues of the Gods That guard a Heaven-loved land! 8 I asked for Brutus. What! too high The passion? Give me Cæsar then! Airs, airs in which her latest sigh Cornelia left, ye nourished Men, Ye nourished Men in those great days Whereon I fix with grief my gaze— O wildly-blooming, slenderest trees, That bend like feathers in the breeze, Have I then hurt you with my song? In deprecating grace your tresses Wide flinging, ye lament your wrong From verse whose very praise oppresses 9 The masters of a milder sway I asked for. Dantè, where art thou? Petrarca, shadowing with deep bay The breadth of an illumined brow? I asked—my tears fell fast and faster— I asked for Raffaelle and his Master. Those gleams, those pictured shapes of theirs! Deep-breathers of Elysian airs— O'er Earth they breathe them, pacing slowly With steps that lead the Elysian measures! O how their awful melancholy Rebukes all baser pains and pleasures! 10 Cease, cease, wild bird, that melody Where grief is over scorn prevailing; In grief thou singest—in grief sing I— Must thou alone be wailing? No, not in grief she sings, but love! The Heavens themselves my grief reprove; The Love-star through that roseate gloom Leaps up—ah yes! o'er Virgil's tomb! O'er Virgil's tomb! But where, O where His strains?—Ye winds whose breath dispersed them Abroad o'er every region, bear Them back into the vales that nursed them! 11 No vain regret or vain desire Could touch that breast whose thoughts immortal Walked ever with the Olympian choir: Across the guarded portal Of godlike souls, no pangs of earth Or entrance find, or issue forth. Pity and love, not grief were thine, Couldst thou, great Bard, thine eyes decline On these fair shores! O teach me thus To bend; nor sigh that beauty viewing Of which yon Heaven is amorous Descending fast to death and ruin! 12 The sun is set. Long shadows grey Trail slowly o'er the mountain head: The olive-forests far away Grow pale, like ashes spread By some dejected Penitent, On locks whose prime was idly spent— Ah, brand no more with harsher name A land which thus herself doth blame! Still in the west a feeble glimmer Is struggling with those shadows dun: The face I love grows dim and dimmer— 'Tis going—It is gone. SONG. 1 A brightened Sorrow veils her face, Sweet thoughts with thoughts forlorn, And playful sadness, like the grace Of an Autumnal morn, When birds new-waked, like sprightly elves, The languid echoes rouse, And infant Zephyrs make themselves Familiar with old boughs. 2 All round our hearts the Maiden's hair Its own soft shade doth fling: Her sigh perfumes the forest air, Like eve—but eve in Spring; When Spring precipitates her flow; And Summer, swift to greet her, Breathes, every night, a warmer glow Half through the dusk to meet her. ODE ON THE ASCENT OF THE ALPS. 1. All night as in my dreams I lay The shout of torrents without number Was in mine ears—‘Away, away, No time have we for slumber! The star-beams in our eddies play— The moon is set: away, away!’ And round the hills in tumult borne Through echoing caves and gorges rocking, The voices of the night and morn Are crying louder in their scorn, My tedious languor mocking. Alas! in vain man's mortal limbs would rise To join in elemental ecstasies! 2. ‘But thou, O Muse, our heavenly mate, Unclogged art thou by fleshly weight! Ascend, upbearing my desire Among the mountains high and higher! Leap from the glen upon the forest; Leap from the forest on the snow: And while from snow to cloud thou soarest Send back thy song below!’ 3. I spake—Behold her o'er the broad lake flying: Like a great Angel missioned to bestow Some boon on men beneath in sadness lying: The waves are murmuring silver murmurs low: Beneath the curdling wind Green through the shades the waters rush and roll, Or whitened only by the unfrequent shoal;— Lo! two dark hills, with darker yet behind, Confront them, purple mountains almost black, Each behind each self-folded and withdrawn Beneath the umbrage of yon cloudy rack— That orange gleam! 'tis dawn! Onward! the swan's flight with yon eagle's blending, On, wingèd Muse; still forward and ascending! 4. That mighty sweep, one orbit of her flight, Has over-curved the mountain's barrier height: She sinks, she speeds, on prosperous wing prevailing (Broad lights below and changeful shadows sailing) Over a vale upon whose breadth may shine Not noontide suns alone, but suns of even, Warming the rich fields in their red decline, The pale streams flushing with the hues of heaven. In vain those Shepherds call; they cannot wake The echoes on this wide and cultured plain, Where spreads the river now into a lake, Now curves through walnut meads its golden chain, In-isling here and there some spot With orchard, hive, and one fair cot; Or children dragging from their boat Into the flood some reverend goat— O happy valley! cradle soft and deep For blissful life, calm sleep, And leisure, and affections free and wide, Give me yon plough, that I with thee may bide, Or climb those stages, cot-bestrown Vast steps of Summer's mountain-throne, Terrace o'er terrace rising, line o'er line, Swathed in the light wreaths of the elaborate vine. On yonder loftiest steep, the last From whose green base the grey rocks rise, In random circle idly cast A happy household lies. Not far there sits the plighted maid; Her locks a lover's fingers braid— Fair, fearless maiden! cause for fear Is none, though he alone were near: Indulge at will thy sweet security! He doth but that bold front incline And all those wind-tossed curls on thine To catch from thy wild lips their mountain purity! 5. Up to lonelier, narrower valleys Winds an intricate ravine Whence the latest snow-blast sallies Through black firs scarce seen. I hear through clouds the Hunter's hollo— I hear, but scarcely dare to follow 'Mid chaotic rocks and woods, Such as in her lyric moods Nature, like a Bacchante, flings From half-shaped imaginings. There lie two prostrate trunks entangled Like intertwisted dragons strangled: Yon glacier seems a prophet's robes; While broken sceptres, thrones, and globes Are strewn, as left by rival States Of elemental Potentates. Pale floats the mist, a wizard's shroud: There looms the broad crag from the cloud:— A thunder-graven Sphinx's head, half blind, Gazing on far lands through the freezing wind! 6. My song grows smoother, hearing A smooth-voiced female hymn, In verse alternate cheering The pass above me dim. Behold them now; a band Of maids descending hand in hand, Singing softly, singing proudly Low-toned anthems echoed loudly— Martyr sufferings, mountain pleasures, Grave, religious, sweet affections, Tuned with notes of ancient measures, Linked with patriot recollections! The land is strong when such as these Inspire their lovers and their brothers: The land is strong with such as these Her heroes' destined mothers! Freedom from every hut Sends down a separate root: And when base swords her branches cut With tenfold might they shoot. Her Temples are of pine-woods made, Not Tyrian gold or Parian stone With roofs of cedar gem-inlaid: There sits she; thence alone To those dispensing her large love Who share her solemn feast above, Nor fear her icy halls, or zone Of clouds with which she girds her own! 7. Mount higher, mount higher! With rock-girdled gyre Behind each grey ridge And pine-feathered ledge A vale is suspended; mount higher, mount higher! From rock to rock leaping The wild goats, they bound; The resinous odours Are wafted around; The clouds, disentangled, With blue gaps are spangled; Green isles of the valley with sunshine are crowned. The birches new budded Make pink the green copse; From the briar and hazel The golden rain drops; As he climbs, the boughs shaking, Nest-seeking, branch-breaking, Beneath the white ash-boughs the shepherd-boy stops. How happy that shepherd! How happy the lass! How freshly beside them The pure Zephyrs pass! Sing, sing! From the soil Springs bubble and boil, And sun-smitten torrents fall soft on the grass. Once more on every turf-clad stage Peeps forth some household hermitage; Once more from tracts serene and high The young lambs bleat, the dams reply. From echoing trunks I hear the dash Of headlong stream or ‘Rans des Vaches.’ Lo! from thickets lightly springing, An old church spire! around its base Devotions ever upward winging, That find in Heaven their resting-place! Around it grey-haired votaries kneel, Who look along it to the skies, And babes with imitative zeal Kissing their lip-worn rosaries. Not soon the mountain Faith grows cold: Yon hamlet is six centuries old! 8. Mount higher, mount higher, To the cloudland nigher; To the regions we climb Of our long-buried prime— In the skies it awaits us—Up higher, up higher! Loud Hymn and clear Pæan From caverns are rolled: Far below us is Summer— We have slipped from her fold; We have passed, like a breath, To new life without death— The Spring and our Childhood all round we behold. 9. What are toils to men who scorn them? Peril what to men who dare? Chains to hands that once have torn them Thenceforth are chains of air! The winds above the snow-plains fleet— Like them I race with wingèd feet: My bonds are dropped; my spirit thrills, A Freeman of the Eternal Hills! Each cloud by turns I make my tent; I run before the radiance sent From every mountain's silver mail Across dark gulfs from vale to vale: The curdling mist in smooth career, A lovely phantom fleeting by, As silent sails through yon pale mere That shrines its own blue sky; The sun that mere makes now its targe, And rainbow vapours tread its marge: A whisper, such as lovers use, Far off on those still heights were heard; But here was never sound of bird; No wild bee lets its murmur loose O'er those blue flowers in rocky cleft Their unvoluptuous eyes that lift From feathery tufts of spangled moss Pure as the snows which they emboss. Lo! like the foam of wintry ocean, The clouds beneath my feet are curled; Dividing now with solemn motion They give me back the world. No veil I fear, no visual bond In this aerial diamond: My head o'er crystal bastions bent, 'Twixt star-crowned spire and battlement I see the river of green ice From precipice to precipice Wind earthward slow, with blighting breath Blackening the vales below like death. Far, far beneath in sealike reach Receding to the horizon's rim, I see the woods of pine and beech, By their own breath made dim: I see the land which heroes trod; I see the land where Virtue chose To live alone, and live to God; The land she gave to those Who know that on the hearth alone True Freedom rears her fort and throne. 10. Lift up, not only hand and eye, Lift up, O Man, thy heart on high: Or downward gaze once more; and seè How spiritual dust can be! Then far into the Future dive, And ask if there indeed survive, When fade the worlds, no primal shapes Of disembodied hills and capes, Types meet to shadow Godhead forth; Dread antitypes of shapes on earth? O Earth! thou shalt not wholly die, Of some ‘new Earth’ the chrysalis Predestined from Eternity, Nor seldom seen through this; On which, in glory gazing, we Perchance shall oft remember thee, And trace through it thine ancient frame Distinct, like flame espied through flame, Or like our earliest friends, above Not lost, though merged in heavenlier love— How changed, yet still the same! 11. Here rest, my Soul, from meteor dreams; And thou, my Song, find rest. The streams That left at morn yon mountain's brow Are sleeping with Locarno now. Earth seeks perforce from joy release; But Heaven in rapture finds her peace. Gaze on those skies at once o'er all the earth Dissolving in a bath of purple dews, And spread thy soul abroad as widely forth Till Love thy soul, as Heaven the snows, suffuse. The sun is set—but upwards without end Two mighty beams, diverging, Like hands in benediction raised, extend; From the great deep a crimson mist is surging: The peaks are pyres where Day doth lie Like Indian widows proud to die; Strange gleams, each moment ten times bright, Shoot round, transfiguring as they smite All spaces of the empyreal height— Deep gleams, high Words which God to man doth speak, From peak to solemn peak in order driven They speed—A loftier vision dost thou seek? Rise then—to Heaven! SONG. (TO A BIRD.) O wing-girt form of air and fire! Thy little heart will burst atwain: Sooner Apollo's steeds will tire Than thou remit that ardent strain! Who changed to shape so fine and small Some Mænad o'er the rough hills flying? What God, expelled the Olympian Hall, In anger took this mould to die in? Fly, Winter, fly! the notes she flingeth Are shafts that pierce thy mailed array: Come, Summer, come! the songs she singeth With buds and blossoms pave thy way! SONG. Give me back my heart, fair child; To you as yet 'twere worth but little! Half beguiler, half beguiled, Be you warned: your own is brittle. ‘Hid it! dropt it on the moors! Lost it, and you cannot find it’— My own heart I want, not yours: You have bound, and must unbind it. Fling it from you: Youth is strong: Love is trouble; love is folly: Love, that makes an old heart young, Makes a young heart melancholy. THE DIGNITY OF SORROW. 1. I have not seen you since the Shadow fell From Heaven against your door: I know not if you bear your Sorrow well: I only know your hearth is cold: your floor Will hear that soft and gliding tread no more. 2. I know our ancient friendship now is over: I can love still, and so will not complain: I have not loved in vain; Taught long that Art of Sadness to discover Which draws stern solace from the wells of pain. You love the dead alone; or you have lost The power and life of Love in Time's untimely frost. 3. You have stood up in the great Monarch's court— The court of Death: in spirit you have seen His lonely shades serene Where all the mighty men of old resort. The eyes of Proserpine, Heavy and black, have rested upon thine. Her vintage, wine from laurel-berries prest, You raised—and laid you then the chalice down, Scared by that Queen's inevitable frown, Just as the marble touched your panting breast? O! in the mirror of that poison cold What Shadow or what Shape did you behold? 4. And she is dead: and you have long been dying: And are recovered, and live on; O Friend! Say, what shall be the end Of leaf-lamenting boughs and wintry sighing? When will the woods that moan Resume their green array? When will the dull, sad clouds be overblown, And a calm sunset close our stormy day? 5. My thoughts pursue you still. I call them back. Once more they seek you, like the birds that rise Up from their reeds, and in a winding track Circle the field wherein their forage lies; Or like some poor and downcast Pensioner, Depressed and timid, though his head be grey, That moves with curving steps to greet his Lord, Whom he hath watched all day— Yet lets him pass away without a word; And gazes on his footsteps from afar. ODE TO AN EOLIAN HARP. Time goes: yet not for ever Are gone those joys once mine: Once more my pulses quiver With every pulse of thine, With every throbbing murmur, And dying gasp divine. As the graceful bending Of a breeze-swayed tree, Rising or descending T'ward the shade-swept lea, Thus are my fancies rocked and swayed By thy slow harmony! Hast thou felt the sorrow Which thy sighs bemoan? Or art fain to borrow, Like the bards, a tone Of visionary sadness And anguish not thine own? By soft Zephyrs greeted Thou dost answer well: Fretfully entreated Thou wilt nothing tell— Let me win thy secret By some flattering spell. Unforgetful mourner Undisquieted! Innocent adorner Of every season fled! Consoler of the absent Condoler of the dead! As one, now blind, that lingers, On the cold world cast, Following with frosty fingers Old names on tree-stems traced, I stand: thy breath like spring unsealing All the ice-bound Past. Making that Past so distant, Thou giv'st us age in youth:— Wilt thou, with boon persistent When youth is gone, in sooth With lights of morning paint once more The mists of time and ruth? On, with angel fleetness, Again those sounds sweep on, Crushing the air to sweetness: They came, and they are gone! Again my dreams desert me: I sit once more alone. When from some doomed city Her Gods depart, such sound Of mixed reproof and pity In refluent airs half drowned Are heard at night among the clouds By kneelers on the ground. Half the world are wailing, Harp of Heaven, like thee! Tell them vain is railing At what needs must be; That sighs are vainer still unless Those sighs make melody. Tell them dead leaves are fragrant; Autumn airs serene; Showers gone by or vagrant Smile with rainbow sheen: Delights, if pure, when buried, Keep their graves long green. From Fortune thus we'll hide us; On Fate our scorn thus wreak: That help the strong denied us We'll borrow from the weak— Hark, hark; again that murmur! O heart, be strong or break! SONG. Cool, if ye may, my hands, rivers soft-sliding! Far-sunken, piny dells, and shadowy glades, Take, take me to your shades! Sea-caverns deep in emerald cloisters hiding Dark gems and endless peace, O bid my tumults cease: Fan me, cold airs, with gelid breath serene: Ye meadows lull me with your soothing green! Heaven is too wide a sphere for Man's weak spirit To fill, and there, with joy or grief opprest, To find, all round, one rest: And Earth, that bourne we sought not but inherit, In her small bound can yield No region and no field For a proud Soul that seeks and seeks for ever That which she knows too well no finite space can give her! TO M. O. B. As if no child on all the earth, Till thou wert born, had golden hair, And eyes, pure lamps of loveliest mirth, Thy Mother lifts her hands to swear No charms were e'er like thine: but I Misdoubt the boast—almost deny. Who knows but in some Grecian vale Even now as fair a child may sit Close-nested like a nightingale, While round and round the dark birds flit Amazed at sunny locks and eyes, Strange rebels 'gainst Egean skies! Who knows but where the almond waves, 'Mid some Circassian forest's gloom, Between two scarce divided graves, An English and a native tomb, Some child like thee the buds may gather, And sing ‘A hero was my Father!’ Ausonia, in her bowered retreats— But has not England too her bowers Where Love with love-touched Beauty meets, And rears from earth supernal flowers? Away, away! 'twere shame to say No child was e'er like thee: away! Or if indeed no prosperous star To form so fine on earth has given A bloom so sweet—what then? there are A thousand such in Heaven! Away, away! 'twere sin to say No child was e'er like thee. Away! COLERIDGE. His eye saw all things in the symmetry Of true and just proportion; and his ear That inner tone could hear Which flows beneath the outer: therefore he Was as a mighty shell, fashioning all The winds to one rich sound, ample and musical. Yet dim that eye with gazing upon heaven; Wearied with vigils, and the frequent birth Of tears when turned to earth: Therefore, though farthest ken to him was given, Near things escaped him: through them—as a gem Diaphanous—he saw; and therefore saw not them. Moreover, men whom sovereign wisdom teaches That God not less in humblest forms abides Than those the great veil hides, Such men a tremor of bright reverence reaches; And thus, confronted ever with high things, Like cherubim they hide their eyes between their wings. No loftier, purer soul than his hath ever With awe revolved the planetary page, From infancy to age, Of Knowledge; sedulous and proud to give her The whole of his great heart for her own sake; For what she is; not what she does, or what can make. And mighty Voices from afar came to him: Converse of trumpets held by cloudy forms, And speech of choral storms: Spirits of night and noontide bent to woo him: He stood the while, lonely and desolate As Adam, when he ruled the world, yet found no mate. His loftiest thoughts were but like palms uplifted, Aspiring, yet in supplicating guise; His sweetest songs were sighs: Adown Lethean streams his spirit drifted, Under Elysian shades from poppied bank With Amaranths massed in dark luxuriance dank. Coleridge, farewell! That great and grave transition Which may not Priest, or King, or Conqueror spare, And yet a Babe can bear, Has come to thee. Through life a goodly vision Was thine; and time it was thy rest to take. Soft be the sound ordained thy sleep to break— When thou art waking, wake me, for thy Master's sake! 1839. A CHARACTER. She scarce can tell if she have loved or not; She of her heart no register has kept: She knows but this, that once too blest her lot Appeared for earth; and that ere long she wept. Upon life's daily task without pretence She moves; and many love her; all revere: She will be full of joy when summoned hence, Yet not unhappy seems while lingering here. If once her breast the storms of anguish tore On that pure lake no weeds or scum they cast: Time has ta'en from her much, but given her more; And of his gifts the best will be the last. Her parents lie beneath the churchyard grass; On her own strength and foresight she is thrown, Who, while her brothers played, too timid was To join their sports; and played or sighed alone. Her heart is as a spot of hallowed ground Filled with old tombs and sacred to the Past, Such as near villages remote is found, Or rain-washed chancel in some woodland waste: It once was pierced each day by some new stone, And thronged with weeping women and sad men; But now it lies with grass and flowers o'ergrown, And o'er it pipes the thrush and builds the wren. MOODS. In heaviness I lay; no word I spake; I breathed no tone; When down from Heaven a thought of joy Into my heart fell prone: It smote, it thrilled, it pierced my mind; Then by that mind's up-buoyaunce Half-lifted, o'er it cast a glow Of beauty and deep joyaunce. It left me: and my soul once more Grew dreary as a flood, When that bright Nymph who bathed therein Hath vanished in the wood: When her last lustre from the wave Is gone, or all but gone, And backward close the forest boughs, And the shades of Eve come on. TO A. S. O. B. I never looked upon the face Of her whom you deplore and love; Yet bending o'er this portrait's grace Some image lost I seem to trace, Not lost, but stored above. I never saw those eyes whose beams Made heaving hearts as calm and bright As Hesper makes the ocean-streams: O! if they shine upon your dreams To you how dear must be the night! I never saw those lips whose breath Was earth's best music once for you: From the cold cells of dreary death What message do they now bequeath? A long and last ‘adieu.’ Your own are trembling: Prize, O prize That farewell word, that holiest sound, The pledge of undissevered ties; Of mortal love in Paradise With love immortal crowned. And though your cheek with tears be wet Forbear to murmur ‘Is this all?’ Love meets and mingles with Regret, Like alienated brethren met At the paternal funeral. I bring your anguish no relief: I scorn, like you, the opiate spell: But barren woes, like joys, are brief; If faithful you would make your grief, Grieve calmly, and grieve well! So shall wise suffering make you wise; So, purged from passion's hectic glow, Life's lasting shapes shall meet your eyes Like nature's naked majesties After a night of snow. So shall repentance easier be, And waking Conscience wake in light, Past times roll back, from night set free, And Life regain her unity, And Death lose half his might. I charge you by the smile that hung Upon her eyes in their eclipse; That to her deep, dark lashes clung, And looked so sweet, and stayed so long, And waned so slowly on her lips; To seek within the cloistered pale Of Sorrow, a sequestered cell; Nor ever stray beyond that vale Which catches on the passing gale Her low, sweet convent bell. And when you feel your spirit burn, Or swell, within your aching breast, Strain to your heart her votive urn:— Speak nothing then—but gently turn Your eyes unto the West, Until they meet that mystic line Where Earth is lost in Heaven's blue gleam, When earliest stars begin to shine, And lessening lights of day decline Along the lilied stream. ANGELINA. For ever gentle, sweet, and lone, Her voice, her step, her hand subdued, She moves like one who ne'er has known The changes of a human mood. The tender dawn of those fair eyes Breaks, vaguely sweet, through tears unfalling; Waking strange Fancies; Memories As sweet, as strange recalling. A soft shade makes her face more fair:— Not softer, slanted from above On lilies rocked in evening air That shadow from the Star of Love! Say, has she loved? in some far sphere Perhaps she loved, and loved in vain; And still in this cold exile here Forgets the cause, but feels the pain. [My hope, in happier days than these] 1 My hope, in happier days than these My love—hope past; Memory's one star on lonely seas; My anchor, last! Why ask'st thou, with subdued surprise, And that mild glee, Wherefore I turn, still turn mine eyes From all, to thee? 2 The blind man turns—and none forbids— Into sunshine His filmy, cold, unlighted lids; The deaf incline To harps whence songs, for them unborn, Float light and free; To graves long-cherished hearts forlorn; And I to thee. DEATH IN CHILDBIRTH. Sweet Martyr of thine Infant and thy Love, O what a death is thine! Is this to die? Then, Love, henceforth approve This, this of all thy gifts the most divine! Grave she needs not: Matrons, cover Her white bed with flowers all over; With the dark, cool violets swathing A full bosom mother-hearted; Under lily shadows bathing Brows whose anguish hath departed. Life with others, Death with thee Plays a grave game smilingly— O Death not Death! through worlds of bliss The happy new-born Soul is straying! O Death not Death! thy Babe in this, An Angel on the earth, is playing! [Three prayers to Heaven the Lover doth present] Three prayers to Heaven the Lover doth present: —That she he loves rest ever innocent: Next for her happiness: and last that he Shield of that goodness and that peace may be. Dear friend, repine no longer—be content; For thou hast gained two wishes out of three! [Smiles are the wrinkles of our Youth:—] Smiles are the wrinkles of our Youth:— Ah, gently turn the page; And say that wrinkles are in sooth But smiles of our old age! EPITAPH. Ye village poor, whose pitying fingers strew Those kind, cold sprays of rosemary and rue; And brush light snows from every tombstone dun, While Evening's orange gleams in sequence run From Pine to Pine—drop here a spray or or two; Though He below was never known to you: And bid the Stranger spare the grave of one Who said of him no evil, and thought none. A SKETCH. Made up of Instincts half, half Appetites, Ingenuous, winning, graceful, graceless, gay, Her wingèd fancies, wheresoe'er they stray, Find, yield, or make a thousand strange delights; Then, ranging swift as sounds or lunar sprites, For ever they desert, but ne'er betray: To please was what they promised; not to stay: No pledge they asked for; they conferred no rights— Welcome them, Stranger, when they come; and say, ‘Away, sweet Wantons!’ when they fly away. [A sigh in the morning grey!] A sigh in the morning grey! And a solitary tear, Slow to gather, slow to fall; And a painful flush of shame At the naming of thy name— This is little, this is all, False one, which remains to say That thy love of old was here; That thy love hath passed away! DOUBTS. Fear not—or thou shalt find Cause too much for fear: Sigh not—or every wind Shall waft thee, deep and drear, The echoes of the murmurs Of many a buried year. O'er the ice-plain gliding, Forward, fearless, race: Doubly hard were sliding With reverted face: Doubts are dull rehearsals Of self-doomed disgrace! LOVE'S SPITE. You take a town you cannot keep; And, forced in turn to fly, O'er ruins you have made shall leap Your deadliest enemy! Her love is yours—and be it so— But can you keep it? No, no, no! Upon her brow we gazed with awe; And loved, and wished to love, in vain; But when the snow begins to thaw We shun with scorn the miry plain. Women with grace may yield: but she Appeared some Virgin Deity. Bright was her soul as Dian's crest Whitening on Vesta's fane its sheen: Cold looked she as the waveless breast Of some stone Dian at thirteen. Men loved: but hope they deemed to be A sweet Impossibility! DOLORES. (SCENE IN A MADHOUSE). 1 She sings her wild dirges, and smiles 'mid the strain; Then turns to remember her sorrow. Men gaze on that smile till their tears fall like rain, And she from their weeping doth borrow. She forgets her own story: and none, she complains, Of the cause for her grief will remind her: She fancies but one of her kindred remains: She is certain he never can find her. Whence caught you, sweet Mourner, the swell of that song? ‘From the arch of yon wind-laden billow.’ Whence learned you, sweet Lady, your sadness?— ‘From Wrong.’ Your meekness who taught you?—‘The Willow.’ 2 She boasts that her tresses have never grown grey; Yet murmurs, ‘How long I am dying! My sorrows but make me more lovely, men say; But I soon in my grave shall be lying! My grave will embrace me all round and all round, More warmly than thou, my false lover; No Rival will steal to my couch without sound: No Sister will come to discover!’ Whence caught you, sweet Mourner, the swell of that song? ‘From the arch of the wind-laden billow.’ Whence learned you, sweet Lady, your sadness?— ‘From Wrong.’ Your meekness who taught you?—‘The Willow.’ 3 She courts the cold wind when the tempests blow hard, And at first she exults in their raving: She clasps with her fingers the lattice close-barred: Like the billows her bosom is waving: But ere long with strange pity her spirit is crossed, And she sighs for poor mariners drowning: And—‘thus in my passion of old I was tossed’— And—‘thus stood my grey Father frowning!’ Whence caught you, sweet Mourner, the swell of that song? ‘From the arch of the wind-laden billow.’ Whence learned you, sweet Lady, your sadness?— ‘From Wrong.’ Your meekness who taught you?—‘The Willow.’ 4 On the wall the rough water chafes ever its breast; 'Mid the willows my bark was awaiting; Passing by, on her cold hand a sad kiss I prest, And slowly moved on to the grating. ‘For my lips, not my fingers, your bounty I crave!’ She cried with a laugh and light shiver: ‘You drift o'er the ocean, and I to the grave; Henceforward we meet not for ever!’ Where found you, sweet Mourner, the swell of that song? ‘In the arch of yon wind-laden billow.’ Whence learned you, sweet Lady, your sadness?— ‘From Wrong.’ Your meekness who taught you?—‘The Willow.’ SONNETS. I. THE POETIC FUNCTION.—1. The College of the Priests is with us still: Still on our low, and sin-defilèd ground The borders of their sacred vestments sound: But where by caverned wood, or crested hill, Or cedar-girded mountain citadel, Where are the high-commissioned Prophets found? The Unanointed Order, not uncrowned, For whom the curtain unremovable Of Time, transparent grows;—to whom is given, When mighty Nations rage in anarchy, Bending with arm outstretched and potent rod To part the waves of that rebellious sea; To warn ill Rulers of the ways of Heaven, And sternly monish Kings that know not God? II. THE POETIC FUNCTION.—2. I asked; and it was answered me—‘The Praise And Burthen, which to these did once belong, Is now committed to the Lords of Song;— For, throned above earth-mist, and Time's poor haze, Their spiritual spheres they build and raise: And those eternal Truths on which are hung The fates of mortals, lurk their leaves among; And what exalts a nation; what betrays. Therefore the People cleave to them: and all To whom the World, not Truth and Man, are dear Abhor them, and suspect; despise, yet fear; And will not bid them to their festival, Unless, like Balak's wise and wicked Seer, They merge the Prophet in the Sorcerer.’ III. A wayward child, scarce knowing what he wanted, Ran to one side while all his comrades played, And in the sunny ground a berry planted: An olive-tree uprose; and in its shade, While summer after summer glowed and panted, That child's descendants sat. The tree decayed: Then of one polished branch this flute was made, The sire of all sweet sounds and strains enchanted, Immortal nurslings of the transient breeze. That child is dead and gone; that olive now Is swept away with all its centuries; Yet this selected fragment of a bough Survives, and may survive till earth expires And mortal strains are lost in songs of heavenly choirs. IV. The spring of my sweet life thou madest thine; And on my summer glories thou hast fed: And now the vernal melodies are dead On lips that mourn for joys no longer mine. The summer brilliance now hath ceased to shine Upon a brow so oft disquieted By agonising doubts: thy love is fled; And thou art flying—how dare I repine? How could I hope so great a love would cleave To one whose fault too well was known to thee? Lament not, O my love; or, if thou grieve, For me lament not, though my grief thou share; For I have known in dreams my destiny, And what I ought to welcome I can bear. V. I was ashamed when some one said to me, ‘How blue those mountains are, that cloud how fair’— I could have praised them first: but could not dare To mix false words with joy so pure and free. And when they said, ‘Behold that shining sea!’ I wept beneath my long and veiling hair; Stung by the rapture which I could not share, Long, long I wept, and unrestrainedly. Stranger! if thou canst help me, help me now. Beauty I saw of old where'er I gazed: But now, like one by light too brilliant dazed, To me the loveliest things look blank and grey. A cloud is on my breast, and on my brow— Abashed I turn from fairest shapes away. VI. The light that played above thine infancy, I see it still in all that shining hair: And on that countenance pale and brow of care, Depressed by melancholy though they be, Departing Youth looks back remorsefully— Then why such sorrow in a world so fair, As if there were no Heaven to minister Immortal nourishment to one like thee? Ah! fret not thou at Fortune's petty stings, Sorrow unlovely and unsanctified, But strictly fortify the loftier heart, Communing hourly with undying things; And, without promptings of injurious pride, Remember what thou wert and what thou art. VII. HUMILITY. Those hills, so graceful, though to us not grand, Are grand to children: shade-swept hill and dale The same in beauty, on an ampler scale With broader trees and shades, for them expand: To them, the pebbles on the wet sea-sand Are gems: to them each river brim and vale Sends forth a thousand odours sweet and bland, Too low for us to catch, too faint, too frail. They see as far as we do: but their eye Comparing all things with a humbler measure, Exalts not less than multiplies their pleasure— Ah that the moral world thus constantly Might yield her gifts to our humility! The smallest key unlocks the largest treasure. VIII. THE ISLAND OF INISFALLEN. The holy sunshine like a garment lay, A sacerdotal vesture dense with gold, On every shelving mound, and slumbrous wold, As round and round we paced at noon our way. Onward we paced by many a winding bay, And hollow lawn that seemed to have ta'en its mould From wave-like anthems rolling here of old, While yet old rites maintained harmonious sway. Green slopes we trod, majestic as the plains Of sand disclosed by Ocean's ebbing tide: Hard by were groves of ash through which we spied The ruined convent with its weather-stains, From whose calm bosom passed of old the strains This Eden of blue lakes that sanctified. IX. To raise the triumph of victorious Art; To poise a temple in the middle air; To deck its walls with sculptures gravely fair Or hues which trace the windings of the heart: To pierce the maze of Science, and to part Error from Truth, until thy sedulous care Had made the moral map of Man as bare Of doubt or hindrance as the Ocean's chart— Was this thine aim, high Spirit? knew'st thou not That, but one soul to lift and purify, And keep a single day from sinful blot, Exceeds the strength of frail mortality? Take back awhile thy corals: and, untaught To totter, be not emulous to fly. X. LOW COMPANY. Sad Host of an ignoble company Of hungry Cares that to thy sumptuous board Troop, not unbidden, preying on their lord— Mingling their shrill harsh voices with the glee Of Pride and Sense, their friends of high degree; If these, unmasked, are duteously abhorred, If thou wouldst be once more from those restored To peace, to honour, and to liberty; Stamp on thy floor, and bid thy guests depart, And fill thy gorgeous chambers with the poor: Yea, press those outcasts to thine aching heart Whom thou so long hast banished from thy door, As if contagion issued from the eye Of Want, or pleading Woe's melodious sigh. XI. Praise from the noble, from the gentle, Love, Too oft unfairly won, or dearly bought, By man may be accepted, though not sought, And when accepted, honoured: for they rove, Outcasts from Heaven, a world that loves them not— If then they seek thy tent or sheltering grove, Count them lost Angels to thy threshold brought For rest, ere yet they wing their flight above. Welcome those Strangers meekly when they come, And gain their blessing when they seek the sky: Strive not to keep them: Earth is not their home; And Man must humbly live, and gladly die. Death—Death, a dark-eyed Page, shall be his guide To seats where Praise and Love with Life and Peace abide. XII. A glorious Crown, if God maintain it, thou, O Queen, hast rightfully inherited: If not, even now it totters on thy head: Therefore to Him present in time thy vow. For thousands are there that have knit their brow Against thy throne and thee: thousands have spread Their hands against thee: yea, the shaft was sped Long since, the venomed shaft on-flying now. And yet despond not; for thy People's prayers, And wise men wakeful all the livelong night, Are striving for thee; and the brave will fight; And all the good are fighting unawares For thee. Away with comfortless despairs! Power is of God; and He will guard the Right. XIII. The golden splendour of the regal Crown Shoots from the meekest brow a dazzling sheen Painful to eyes malignant. King or Queen! Think not of men, whether they smile or frown. The Princely sceptre and the Priestly gown Are symbols of eternal Power serene; Visibly preaching Him who reigns unseen— An impious deed it were to lay them down, And to usurp that peace by Heaven bestowed Upon the Holy Order of the Poor; That genuine peace which can alone endure While men are trained to mark the hand of God Alike in all things; doing, each his part, In low estate or high, with an untroubled heart. XIV. Far rather let us loathe and scorn the power Of Song, than seek her fane with hearts impure, Panting for praise or pay, the vulgar lure Of those on whom the Muse doth scantly shower, Or not at all, her amaranthine dower: Ye that would serve her, first of this be sure, Her glorious Pæans will for aye endure Whether or not she smile upon your bower. Go forth, eternal Melodies, go forth O'er all the world, and in your broad arms wind it! Go forth, as ye are wont, from south to north; No spot so barren but your spells can find it: So long as Heaven is vaulted o'er the earth, So long your power survives, and who can bind it? XV. FORM OF CONSECRATION FOR A NEW HOUSE. I bless thy new-raised threshold: let us pray That never faithless friend, insulting foe, O'er this pure stone their hateful shadows throw: May the poor gather round it day by day. I bless this hearth: thy children here shall play: Here may their graces and their virtues blow: May sin defile it not; and want and woe And sickness seldom come, nor come to stay. I bless thy House. I consecrate the whole To God. It is His Temple. Let it be Worthy of Him, confided thus to thee. Man's dwelling, like its lord, enshrines a soul: It hath great destinies, wherein do lie, Self-sown, the seeds of Immortality. XVI. TO AN INFANT. Familiar Spirit! that so graciously Dost take whatever fortune may befall, Trusting thy fragile form to the arms of all, And never counting it indignity To sit caressed upon the humblest knee; Thou, having yet no words, aloud dost call Upon our hearts: the fever and the gall Of our dark bosoms are reproved in thee. From selfish fears and lawless wishes free, Thou hast no painful feeling of thy weakness; From shafts malign and pride's base agony Protected by the pillows of thy meekness: Thou hast thy little loves which do not grieve thee, Unquiet make thee, or unhappy leave thee. XVII. EARTHLY HOPE. Painter of Hope! too bright that brow, too fair; Those eyes too eager; all too deep the flush Upon that cheek! O bid those streams that gush So warmly, backward to her heart repair, And warm, if warm they can, the chillness there: Make her unconscious hands deflower and crush Those unblown buds: command the tears to rush Into worn eyes that, sadly constant, stare As if they strove the narrowing light to hold Of some far object, gliding fast away. Let this be Hope: then make her stand forlorn Upon the shore disconsolate and cold Of seas fast-ebbing, over which the morn Begins to tremble with its ashy grey. XVIII. Ample, and vast, and infinitely still, Slants down from the blue crystal of the sky, Throne of the Muse, the Heliconian hill: Citheron's frowning crest ascends hard by With clouds and tempest plagued perpetually: There walk those feet that fates unblest fulfil: There tread the avenging Furies: wild and shrill There rings the victim's shriek, the Mænad's cry. Poets! let none deceive you; nor confound Tumult with strength. Then most the Muse is calm, Singing the strifes of sublunary things: Steady her hand among the quivering strings: No sorrow she approves that slights her balm: Her toils are rest-ennobled, virtue-crowned! XIX. Nations, their mission o'er, their office done, Are forcibly drawn downwards; and that tide Which raised them, homeward summoned doth subside. What man by art can stay the sinking sun, Or Spring departing when her goal is won? States too are transient! longer none may bide When once, its lesson taught or place supplied, That steadying weight by it sustained is gone. Nations, be wise! Whate'er the course ye hold, Strive that your furthest aim subservient be To the virtuous progress of Humanity. Woe to that greatness which commercial gold Alone creates, or seals. Such leaves no trace, Sinking; and lighter things float up into its place. XX. TO THE THAMES. River, whose charge is from the winds and sky The Imperial City's agitated ear To soothe with murmur low and ceaseless cheer, Do thy great, pious task perpetually: But add a warning voice more deep and high: Borne down from bridge to bridge in smooth career Tell her to whom the pomp of gold is dear, Of Tyre that fell; of Fortune's perfidy! Tell her, whilst on thy broad and glimmering mirror The shadows of her turrets tremble and slide, How brief the impress of victorious Pride, How nearly Triumph is allied to Terror. Demons their nests in ship-mast forests hide— By nobleness, not gold, are Nations deified. XXI. ‘IN ALL THINGS LOYALTY.’ One Virtue reigned supreme in days gone by, Familiarly beloved, with awe obeyed: The name survives amongst us—Loyalty: By her all natural ties were Virtues made: All Virtues, humble while their Queen stood nigh, Unsunned remained, and pure, beneath the shade: Without her now, they strut in masquerade, Vainglorious pageants for the public eye! Sans-foy! Sans-loy! Sans-joy!—the Patron Saints Which every modern warrior, on his casque Blazons—each scribe on his phylactery! How will ye better help a land that faints With hunger, long and vainly do I ask, Than ancient Faith, or Hope, or Charity? XXII. MILTON VISITING GALILEO IN HIS BLINDNESS. Behold how long, and with what earnest eye He gazes on that venerable face, And forehead heavenward lifted! Doth he trace In that calm symbol of serenity And sorrow mastered with a loftier grace, The shadow of his own high destiny; Virtue contending with the pride of place, Blindness, unhonoured age, and penury? Yes—ye are like, though Time not yet hath marred The lightest of those locks; nor anguish pressed The signet of her silence cold and hard Upon those lips so lovely in their rest: Yes—ye are like, as morn is like to even, Or trance of Summer-noon to Winter's frozen heaven. XXIII. THE OLD AGE OF MILTON. I knew him. Blind and pale, but undepressed, He sat beneath his hovel's silent shade, Sternly quiescent. At his feet were laid Two forms reclining there in heavenly rest: One held a book; his hand the other kissed With awe; but while the younger daughter read I saw the mournful drooping of his head, I saw the sideway leaning of his breast Like Theseus bending o'er the Minotaur. Supported on one hand, he seemed to gaze Into the face of some accursèd thing— O Nation, self-enslaving more and more, And thou, disastrous, nation-selling King, Why trouble ye this blind man old in days? XXIV. For we the mighty mountain plains have trod Both in the glow of sunset and sunrise; And lighted by the moon of southern skies! The snow-white torrent of the thundering flood We two have watched together: In the wood We two have felt the warm tears dim our eyes While zephyrs softer than an infant's sighs Ruffled the light air of our solitude! O Earth, maternal Earth, and thou, O Heaven, And Night first-born, who now, e'en now, dost waken The host of stars, thy constellated train! Tell me if those can ever be forgiven, Those abject, who together have partaken These Sacraments of Nature—and in vain? XXV. Flowers growing to the level of the hand; Flowers we may pluck without the toil of stooping; And fruits from orchard branches gently drooping, To our warm lips by every Zephyr fanned; Delights, timid, yet tame, that come fast trooping, Like birds that hear a well-known summons bland, Such are the joys we hold at our command; The joys that we escape, for ever scooping The insalubrious mines of sensual Care For stuff to load a back already weary, Or climbing mountain ridges dark and bare In search of colder winds, and views more dreary. Ah, fatal Contradiction! do we roam, Hoping to fly from self, or find a home? XXVI. MARCELLA.—1. Marcella! those that to the Gods are dear On thee may gaze with forehead undepressed: Thy sire, thy brothers thou hast oft caressed, And others are there, men whom all revere, On whom thou canst not look with eye austere: Nay, there may come a time when on thy breast Or knee, a child of thine in sleep may rest Or upward gaze untroubled with a fear. But we, Marcella, never without awe Approach thee; never without awe depart: To us thy gentlest words are as a law: The sacred wisdom of the virgin heart Shines through these clear calm eyes, and to thine hand Commits unseen a sceptre of command. XXVII. MARCELLA.—2. Eyes justly levelled, searching yet sedate, A marble brow enthroning a still light, A cheek that neither seeks nor shuns our sight, A form severely fair, on which aye wait All natural emblems of unboastful state; A step reserved, yet steadied by the might Of fearless frankness, garments dark as night, A breast the Loves in vain would penetrate— Thou hast no wishes: for the vestal Spirit As with a beaming breastplate doth repel Whate'er of troubled joy with her would dwell. The brave with thee approval find, not merit: Thy first of duties deem'st thou this—to scorn Whatever is not of the Immortals born. XXVIII. RATIONALISM. Notions of notions docketed and classed: Shadows self-chased along a barren ground: Pale tracks of foam in wandering waves half-drowned: Thin shreds of song half lost in winter's blast— These starved and squalid Systems cannot last: Vainly man's plummet the great deep would sound, Man's arms enclose within their pigmy bound Of sense, the Present, Future, and the Past. Well skilled to trace the diagrams of thought, Our modern Muse (with aid of compass) shines In abstract lore of surfaces and lines; Courses along Truth's limits; enters not; Steps not across the threshold; dares not tread The space within devote to God and to the dead! XXIX. System o'erstrained offends through haughtiness: Hours chained to tasks, resolves in steel arrayed, Words strict as edicts, measured each, and weighed, Are well; but nought is healthy in excess. Our thoughts grow tangled in their phalanxes: And oft, by inward discipline betrayed, From outward things we win a lowlier aid, From chance a surer guide in our distress. With her habitual, half-unconscious kindness, Nature, our sweet companionable friend, Upon our forehead breathes and clears our blindness, Sends her familiar sprites our steps to tend, A scent, a sound, a swan that cuts the lake, To lure dark fancies brightening in her wake! XXX. SOLITUDE WITHOUT VOCATION. In this Seclusion, from the world secure, Her frauds, her force, her clamour, and her din, O what a prosperous height might virtue win, If, entering first these courts, the soul were pure! But to a tainted soul, how weak the lure Of outward things compared with snares within, Where thought tracks thought, insatiable pursuer, On through the inmost caves of lurking sin— Dark thoughts which nobler presences had scared, And palpable duties crushed! Ah, well of old Fabled the priest, if priest he were or bard, His Dian strenuous of life and bold: A Huntress o'er the mountain summits hard, Her couch beside the fountain calm but cold. THE YEAR OF SORROW AND OTHER POEMS. TO HIS EMINENCE CARDINAL NEWMAN, THESE POEMS ARE ONCE MORE DEDICATED WITH RESPECT, AFFECTION, AND GRATITUDE. THE YEAR OF SORROW—IRELAND— 1849. I.—SPRING. Once more, through God's high will, and grace Of hours that each its task fulfils, Heart-healing Spring resumes her place, The valley throngs and scales the hills; In vain. From earth's deep heart o'ercharged The exulting life runs o'er in flowers; The slave unfed is unenlarged: In darkness sleep a Nation's powers. Who knows not Spring? Who doubts, when blows Her breath, that Spring is come indeed? The swallow doubts not; nor the rose That stirs, but wakes not; nor the weed. I feel her near, but see her not; For these with pain uplifted eyes Fall back repulsed, and vapours blot The vision of the earth and skies. I see her not: I feel her near, As, charioted in mildest airs, She sails through yon empyreal sphere, And in her arms and bosom bears That urn of flowers and lustral dews Whose sacred balm, o'er all things shed, Revives the weak, the old renews, And crowns with votive wreaths the dead. Once more the cuckoo's call I hear; I know, in many a glen profound, The earliest violets of the year Rise up like water from the ground. The thorn I know once more is white; And, far down many a forest dale, The anemonies in dubious light Are trembling like a bridal veil. By streams released that singing flow From craggy shelf through sylvan glades The pale narcissus, well I know, Smiles hour by hour on greener shades. The honeyed cowslip tufts once more The golden slopes; with gradual ray The primrose stars the rock, and o'er The wood-path strews its milky way. From ruined huts and holes come forth Old men, and look upon the sky! The Power Divine is on the earth: Give thanks to God before ye die! And ye, O children worn and weak! Who care no more with flowers to play, Lean on the grass your cold, thin cheek, And those slight hands, and, whispering, say, ‘Stern mother of a race unblest, In promise kindly, cold in deed,— Take back, O Earth, into thy breast, The children whom thou wilt not feed.’ II.—SUMMER. Approved by works of love and might, The Year, consummated and crowned, Hath scaled the zenith's purple height, And flings his robe the earth around. Impassioned stillness, fervours calm, Brood, vast and bright, o'er land and deep: The warrior sleeps beneath the palm; The dark-eyed captive guards his sleep. The Iberian labourer rests from toil; Sicilian virgins twine the dance; Laugh Tuscan vales in wine and oil; Fresh laurels flash from brows of France. Far off, in regions of the North, The hunter drops his winter fur; Sun-wakened babes their feet stretch forth; And nested dormice feebly stir. But thou, O land of many woes! What cheer is thine? Again the breath Of proved Destruction o'er thee blows, And sentenced fields grow black in death. In horror of a new despair His blood-shot eyes the peasant strains, With hands clenched fast, and lifted hair, Along the daily darkening plains. ‘Why trusted he to them his store? Why feared he not the scourge to come?’ Fool! turn the page of History o'er— The roll of Statutes—and be dumb! Behold, O People! thou shalt die! What art thou better than thy sires? The hunted deer a weeping eye Turns on his birthplace, and expires. Lo! as the closing of a book, Or statute from its base o'erthrown, Or blasted wood, or dried-up brook, Name, race, and nation, thou art gone! The stranger shall thy hearth possess; The stranger build upon thy grave: But know this also—he, not less, His limit and his term shall have. Once more thy volume, open cast, In thunder forth shall sound thy name; Thy forest, hot at heart, at last God's breath shall kindle into flame. Thy brook dried up a cloud shall rise, And stretch an hourly widening hand, In God's good vengeance, through the skies, And onward o'er the Invader's land. Of thine, one day, a remnant left Shall raise o'er earth a Prophet's rod, And teach the coasts of Faith bereft The names of Ireland, and of God. III.—AUTUMN. Then die, thou Year—thy work is done: The work ill done is done at last: Far off, beyond that sinking sun Which sets in blood, I hear the blast That sings thy dirge, and says—‘Ascend, And answer make amid thy peers, Since all things here must have an end, Thou latest of the famine years!’ I join that voice. No joy have I In all thy purple and thy gold; Nor in that nine-fold harmony From forest on to forest rolled; Nor in that stormy western fire Which burns on ocean's gloomy bed, And hurls, as from a funeral pyre, A glare that strikes the mountain's head; And writes on low-hung clouds its lines Of cyphered flame, with hurrying hand; And flings amid the topmost pines That crown the cliff, a burning brand. Make answer, Year, for all thy dead, Who found not rest in hallowed earth; The widowed wife, the father fled, The babe age-stricken from his birth. Make answer, Year, for virtue lost; For courage proof 'gainst fraud and force Now waning like a noontide ghost; Affections poisoned at their source. The labourer spurned his lying spade; The yeoman spurned his useless plough; The pauper spurned the unwholesome aid Obtruded once, exhausted now. The roof-trees fall of hut and hall; I hear them fall, and falling cry, ‘One fate for each, one fate for all; So wills the Law that willed a lie.’ Dread power of Man! what spread the waste In circles hour by hour more wide, And would not let the past be past? That Law which promised much, and lied. Dread power of God; Whom mortal years Nor touch, nor tempt: Who sitt'st sublime In night of night,—O bid thy spheres Resound at last a funeral chime! Call up at last the afflicted race, Whom Man, not God, abolished. Sore, For centuries, their strife: the place That knew them once shall know no more! IV.—WINTER. Fall, snow, and cease not! Flake by flake The decent winding-sheet compose: Thy task is just and pious; make An end of blasphemies and woes. Fall, flake by flake! by thee alone, Last friend, the sleeping draught is given: Kind nurse, by thee the couch is strewn, The couch whose covering is from Heaven. Descend and clasp the mountain's crest; Inherit plain and valley deep: This night on thy maternal breast A vanquished nation dies in sleep. Lo! from the starry Temple Gates Death rides, and bears the flag of peace: The combatants he separates; He bids the wrath of ages cease. Descend, benignant Power! But O, Ye torrents, shake no more the vale: Dark streams, in silence seaward flow: Thou rising storm, remit thy wail. Shake not, to-night, the cliffs of Moher, Nor Brandon's base, rough sea! Thou Isle, The Rite proceeds! From shore to shore, Hold in thy gathered breath the while. Fall, snow! in stillness fall, like dew, On church's roof and cedar's fan; And mould thyself on pine and yew; And on the awful face of Man. Without a sound, without a stir, In streets and wolds, on rock and mound, O, omnipresent Comforter, By thee, this night, the lost are found! On quaking moor and mountain moss, With eyes upstaring at the sky, And arms extended like a cross, The long-expectant sufferers lie. Bend o'er them, white-robed Acolyte! Put forth thine hand from cloud and mist; And minister the last sad Rite, Where altar there is none, nor priest. Touch thou the gates of soul and sense; Touch darkening eyes and dying ears; Touch stiffening hands and feet, and thence Remove the trace of sins and tears. And, ere thou seal those filmèd eyes, Into God's urn thy fingers dip, And lay, 'mid eucharistic sighs, The sacred wafer on the lip. This night the Absolver issues forth: This night the Eternal Victim bleeds:— O winds and woods; O heaven and earth! Be still this night. The Rite proceeds! TO BURNS'S ‘HIGHLAND MARY.’ O loved by him whom Scotland loves, Long loved, and honoured duly By all who love the bard who sang So sweetly and so truly! In cultured dales his song prevails; Thrills o'er the eagle's aëry— Has any caught that strain, nor sighed For Burns's ‘Highland Mary’? I wandered on from hill to hill, I feared nor wind nor weather, For Burns beside me trode the moor, Beside me pressed the heather. I read his verse: his life—alas! O'er that dark shades extended:— With thee at last, and him in thee, My thoughts their wanderings ended. His golden hours of youth were thine; Those hours whose flight is fleetest Of all his songs to thee he gave The freshest and the sweetest. Ere ripe the fruit one branch he brake, All rich with bloom and blossom; And shook its dews, its incense shook, Above thy brow and bosom. And when his Spring, alas, how soon! Had vanished, self-subverted, His Summer, like a god repulsed, Had from his gates departed; Beneath that evening star, once more, Star of his morn and even! To thee his suppliant hands he spread, And hailed his love ‘in heaven.’ And if his spirit in ‘a waste Of shame’ too oft was squandered, And if too oft his feet ill-starred In ways erroneous wandered; Yet still his spirit's spirit bathed In purity eternal; And all fair things through thee retained For him their aspect vernal. Nor less that tenderness remained Thy favouring love implanted; Compunctious pity, yearnings vague For love to earth not granted; Reserve with freedom, female grace Well matched with manly vigour, In songs where fancy twined her wreaths Round judgment's stalwart rigour. A mute but strong appeal was made To him by feeblest creatures: In his large heart had each a part That part had found in Nature's. The wildered sheep, sagacious dog, Old horse reduced and crazy; The field-mouse by the plough upturned, And violated daisy. In him there burned that passionate glow All Nature's soul and savour, Which gives its hue to every flower, To every fruit its flavour: Nor less the kindred power he felt; That love of all things human Whereof the fiery centre is The love man bears to woman. He sang the dignity of man, Sang woman's grace and goodness; Passed by the world's half-truths; her lies Pierced through with lance-like shrewdness: Upon life's broad highways he stood, And aped nor Greek nor Roman; But snatched from heaven Promethean fire To glorify things common. He sang of youth, he sang of age, Their joys, their griefs, their labours Felt with, not for, the people; hailed All Scotland's sons his neighbours: And therefore all repeat his verse, Hot youth, or greybeard steady, The boatman on Loch Etive's wave, The shepherd on Ben Ledi. He sang from love of song; his name Dunedin's cliff resounded: He left her, faithful to a fame On truth and nature founded: He sought true fame, not loud acclaim; Himself and Time he trusted: For laurels crackling in the flame His fine ear never lusted. He loved, and reason had to love, The illustrious land that bore him: Where'er he went, like heaven's broad tent A star-bright Past hung o'er him: Each isle had fenced a saint recluse, Each tower a hero dying; Down every mountain-gorge had rolled The flood of foemen flying. From age to age that land had paid No alien throne submission; For feudal faith had been her Law, And freedom her Tradition. Where frowned the rocks had Freedom smiled, Sung 'mid the shrill wind's whistle— So England prized her garden Rose, But Scotland loved her Thistle. Fair field alone the brave demand, And Scotland ne'er had lost it; And honest prove the hate and love To objects meet adjusted: Her will and way had ne'er been crossed In fatal contradiction; Nor loyalty to treason soured, Nor faith abused with fiction. Can song be false where hearts are sound? Weak doubts, away we fling them! The land that breeds great men, great deeds, Shall ne'er lack bards to sing them: That vigour, sense, and mutual truth Which baffled each invader, Shall fill her marts, and feed her arts, While peaceful olives shade her. Honour to Scotland and to Burns! In him she stands collected: A thousand streams one river make— Thus Genius, heaven-directed, Conjoins all separate veins of power In one great soul-creation; Thus blends a million men to make The Poet of the nation. Be green for aye, green bank and brae Around Montgomery's Castle! Blow there, ye earliest flowers! and there, Ye sweetest song-birds, nestle! For there was ta'en that last farewell In hope, indulged how blindly; And there was given that long last gaze ‘That dwelt’ on him ‘sae kindly.’ No word of thine recorded stands; Few words that hour were spoken: Two Bibles there were interchanged, And some slight love-gift broken: And there thy cold faint hands he pressed, Thy head by dew-drops misted; And kisses, ill-resisted first, At last were unresisted. Ah cease!—she died. He too is dead. Of all her girlish graces Perhaps one nameless lock remains: The rest stern Time effaces— Dust lost in dust. Not so: a bloom Is hers that ne'er can wither; And in that lay which lives for aye The twain live on together. PSYCHE; OR, AN OLD POET'S LOVE.— 1847. I. O western Isle that gave her birth! O Delos of a holier sea! O casket of uncounted worth! How dear thou art to Love and me! Thy whispering woods, in some soft dell, Now charmed, now broke the Infant's rest; Thy vales the wild-flower cherished well, Predestined for the Virgin's breast. May airs salubrious, gusts of balm, On all thy shores incumbent, blow Thy billow from the glassy calm, And fringe thy myrtles with sea-snow! My Psyche's lips thy zephyrs breathe; My Psyche's feet thy pastures tread:— O Isle of isles, around me wreathe Thine asphodels when I am dead. II. How blue were Ariadne's eyes, When from the sea's horizon line, At eve, she raised them on the skies! My Psyche, bluer far are thine. How pallid, snatched from falling flowers, The cheek averse of Proserpine, Unshadowed yet by Stygian bowers! My Psyche, paler far is thine. Yet thee no lover e'er forsook; No tyrant urged with love unkind: Thy joy the ungentle could not brook; Thy light would strike the unworthy blind. A golden flame invests thy tresses: An azure flame invests thine eyes: And well that wingless form expresses Communion with relinquished skies. Forbear, O breezes of the West, To waft her to her native bourne; For heavenly, by her feet impressed, Becomes our ancient earth outworn! On Psyche's life our beings hang: In Psyche life and love are one:— My Psyche glanced at me and sang, ‘Perhaps to-morrow I am gone!’ III.—PSYCHE'S BATH. O stream beloved! O stream unknown! In which my love has bathed, Be still thy fount unvexed with floods Thy marge by heats unscathed! How oft her white hand tempted thine! How oft, by fears delayed, Ere yet her light had filled thy depth, With thee her shadow played! Thy purity encompassed hers; Thy crystal cased my pearl; Of founts, the fairest fount embraced Of girls, the loveliest girl! May still thy lilies round thee wave, As shaken by a sigh! Thy violets, blooming where she gazed, Bloom first and latest die! May better bards, when I am gone, Like birds salute thy bower; And each that sings thee grow in heart A virgin from that hour! IV.—PSYCHE'S STUDY. The low sun smote the topmost rocks, Ascending o'er the eastern sea: Backward my Psyche waved her locks, And held her book upon her knee. No brake was near, no flower, no bird, No music but the ocean wave, That with complacent murmur stirred The echoes of a neighbouring cave. Absorbed my Psyche sat, her face Reflecting Plato's sun-like soul, And seemed in every word to trace The pent-up spirit of the whole. Absorbed she sat in breathless mood, Unmoved as kneeler at a shrine, Save one slight finger that pursued The meaning on from line to line. As some white flower in forest nook Bends o'er its own face in a well, So seemed the virgin in that book Her soul, unread before, to spell. Sudden, a crimson butterfly On that illumined page alit:— My Psyche flung the volume by, And sister-like, gave chase to it! V. Nearer yet, by soft degrees, Nearer nestling by my side, Her arm she propped upon my knees; Her head, ere long, its place supplied. Mysteriously a child there lurked Within that soaring spirit wild: Mysteriously a woman worked Imprisoned in that fearless child. One thought before me, like a star, Rolled onward ever, always on; It called me to the fields afar, In which triumphant palms are won. The concourse of far years I heard Applausive as a summer sea:— My trance was broken: Psyche stirred;— ‘Is Psyche nothing then to thee?’ VI. Ah, that a lightly-lifted hand Should thus man's soul depress or raise, And wield, as with a magic wand, A spirit steeled in earlier days! Ah, that a voice whose speech is song, Whose pathos weeps, whose gladness smiles, Should melt a heart unmoved so long, And charm it to the Syren Isles! Ah, that one presence, morn or eve, Should fill deserted halls with light; One breeze-like step, departing, leave The noonday darker than the night! Thy power is great: but Love and Youth Conspire with thee. With thee they dwell: From those kind eyes in tenderest ruth On mine they look and say, ‘Farewell!’ VII. Love! Love the avenger! Had I deemed There lived such beauty, ere too late, But once of Psyche had I dreamed, How different had been my fate! I heard of Virtue, and believed: But till that glorious face I saw, Her image in my soul conceived Possessed me less with love than awe. It was mine own infirmity:— I heard, believed; but Faith was weak: The Syren-Muse for ever nigh, Forbade me heavenlier lights to seek. Deposed I stand by power divine: The robes of Song are changed for chains; To love my Psyche; this is mine; To love—not seek her—this remains. VIII.—PSYCHE DRAWING. Of mind all light, and tenderest-handed, She sketched, untaught, an infant's face, And as the ideal Thought expanded, Stamped, line by line, a deepening grace. Not pilotless her fancy dreamed, Though borne through shoreless seas and air: From native regions on her beamed The archetypes of True and Fair. As when the Spring with touches pure Evolves some blossom, hour by hour, So Psyche's Thought became mature; So Psyche nursed her human flower. The billowy locks, the look intense, The eyes so piercing, sweet, and wild!— I cried, inspired by sudden sense, ‘Thus Psyche looked, an infant child!’ IX.—PSYCHE'S REMORSE. A word unkind, yet scarce unkind, Was sweetened by so soft a smile, It lingered long in heart and mind, Yet hardly woke a pang the while. At night she dreamed that I was dead; And wished to touch, yet feared to stir, The heavy hands beside me laid, Incapable of love and her. We met at morning: still her breast Rose gently with a mournful wave: And of the flowers thereon, the best She gave; and kissed before she gave. X.—PSYCHE SINGING. Between the green hill and the cloud The skylark loosed his silver chain Of rapturous music, clear and loud— My Psyche answered back the strain! A glory rushed along the sky; She sang, and all dark things grew plain; Hope, starlike, shone; and Memory Flashed like a cypress gemmed with rain. Once more the skylark recommenced; Once more from heaven his challenge rang: Again with him my Psyche fenced; At last the twain commingled sang. Then first I learned the skylark's lore; Then first the words he sang I knew: My soul with rapture flooded o'er As breeze-borne gossamer with dew. XI. Wert thou a child, O gladness then Thy hand in mine to roam the woods, And teach that child in vale or glen To scale the rocks, nor fear the floods! What joy the page of ancient lore To turn: her dawn of thought to watch: And from her kindling eyes once more The sunrise of old times to catch! Wert thou an infant, then my arms Might lift thee in the light; and I The captive were of infant charms:— From such at least no need to fly! Wert thou my sister, Love would swear To own thenceforth no haughtier name: Whatever form that Soul might wear, The spell would be to me the same. It is not love that rules my heart, Nor aught by mortals named or known: I know but this;—when near thou art, I live. I die when thou art gone. XII. As when—deep chaunts abruptly stayed— The Thoughts that, music-born, advanced In tides of puissance, music-swayed And waves that in the glory danced, Contract, subside, and leave at last, Where late the abounding floods were spread, A vale of darkness, grim and vast, A buried river's rocky bed; Thus—when thou goest—my heart, my life Descend to dim sepulchral caves; My world, but late with rapture rife, Becomes a world of rocks and graves. Come back! From mountain-cells afar, My soul's strong river shall return: Come back! Again the Morning Star Shall shine against the exhaustless urn. XIII. My Psyche laid her silken hand Upon my silver head, And said, ‘To thee shall I remand The light of seasons fled?’ The child bent o'er me as she spake; And, leaning yet more near, A tress that kissed me for Love's sake, Removed from me a tear. Psyche, not so! lest life should grow Near thee too deeply sweet; And I who censure Death as slow Should fear her far-off feet. Eternal sweetness, love, and truth, Are in thy face enshrined; The breathing soul of endless youth On wafts thee like a wind. Those eyes, where'er they chance to gaze, Might wake to songs the dumb! Breathe thou upon my blighted bays— Rose-odoured they become! Yet go, and cheer a happier throng: For Death, a spouse dark-eyed, On me her eyes hath levelled long, And calls me to her side. O'er yon not distant coast, even now, What shape ascends? A Tomb. Farewell, my Psyche!—why shouldst thou Be shadowed by its gloom? XIV. ‘Can Love be just? can Hope be wise? Can Youth renew his honours dead?’— On me my Psyche turned her eyes; And all my great resolves were fled. Psyche, I said, when thou art nigh Transpicuous grow the mists of years: I cannot ever wholly die If on my grave should drop thy tears. Nor thine a part in mortal hours: Thy flower nor autumn knows, nor May: Thou bendest from sidereal bowers A dateless glory, fresh for aye! Though I be nothing, yet the best To thee no gift of price could give:— Fall then, in radiance, on my breast, And in thy blessing bid me live! XV. Pure lip coralline, slightly stirred; Thus stir; but speak not! Love can see On you the syllables unheard Which are his only melody. Pure, drooping lids; dark lashes wet With that unhoped-for, trembling tear; Thus droop; thus meet; nor give me yet The eyes that I desire, yet fear. Hands lightly clasped on meekest knee; All-beauteous head, as by a spell Bent forward; loveliest form, to me A lovely Soul made visible;— Speak not! move not! More tender grows The heart, long musing. Night may plead, Perhaps, my part; and, at its close, The morning bring me light indeed. XVI. ‘Such beauty was not born to die!’ That thought above my fancy kept Hovering like moonbeams tremulously; And as its lustre waned, I slept. Deep Love kept vigil. Where she sate Methought I sought her. Ah the change! Youth freezes at the frown of Fate; And Time defied will have revenge. The summer sunshine of her head Had changed to moonlight tresses grey: O'er all her countenance was spread The twilight of a winter's day. Dim as a misty tree ere morn, Sad as a tide-deserted strand, She sate, with roseless lip forlorn:— I knelt, and, reverent, kissed her hand. I loved her. Whom I loved of yore, A shape all lustrous from the skies, I loved that hour, and loved far more, So sweet in this unjust disguise. A human tenderness, a love, More deep than loves of prosperous years, Through all my spirit rose and strove, And, cloud-like, o'er her sank in tears. XVII. She leaves us! Many a gentler breast Will mourn our common loss like me: The babe her hand, her voice caressed, The lamb that couched beside her knee. The touch thou lovest—the robe's far gleam— Thou shalt not find, thou dark-eyed fawn! Thy light is lost, exultant stream: Dim woods, your sweetness is withdrawn. Descend dark heavens, and flood with rain Their crimson roofs; their silence rout: Their vapour-laden branches strain; And force the smothered sadness out! That so the ascended moon, when breaks The cloud, may light once more a scene Fair as some cheek that suffering makes Only more tearfully serene: That so the vale she loved may look Calm as some cloister roofed with snows, Wherein, unseen, in shadowy nook, A buried Vestal finds repose. XVIII. Ah! Grief had but begun to grieve When thus I trifled with my sighs: Who brings what Psyche brought must leave The loss no song can harmonise. She brought me back the buried years; And glorious in her light they shone: Once more their sun is set; and tears Deface their care-worn aspect wan. Old joys, old sorrows,—ghosts unlaid,— In every dirge-like breeze go by: Loved phantoms haunt the unwholesome shade: Ah then revived they but to die? They die, like music: like a tide They ebb through darkness far away: Till, meeting Lethè, side by side The rivers roll that love not day. XIX. Cold Fount, I sing thee not, although Thy wave has cooled abandoned hands: Sing thou, cold-lipped, in whispers low, The praises of thy shells and sands. Dark cave that, lenient, in the woods Didst breathe thy darkness o'er my day, I sing thee not, though sullen moods Relaxed in thee, and waned away. The Shepherd youth whose love is fled Lies outcast in some lonely place: But o'er his eyes her veil is spread, And airy kisses touch his face. Beneath that veil his eyes may stream; Beneath that heaven his heart may heave: The day goes by him like a dream, And comfort comes to him at eve. He sings: her name makes sweet his strains: Such solace suits a stripling's years— For age what healing herb remains? Nor love, nor hope, nor song, nor tears. XX. What art thou? If thou liv'st, I know That thou art good, and true, and fair: But Love, the Avenger, whispers low At times, ‘Thy passion paints the air! ‘Love's fair, true world thou deem'dst at first Was only fair through Fancy's gleam:— At last thou lov'st, with doom reversed, As beauteous Truth a Poet's dream. ‘Too late thy Fancy, tired of dust, Unsphered a Spirit. Self-enthralled, It worships now, because it must, An Idol pride at first installed. ‘Or else the pathos of the Past Above thy Present moves in power; And o'er thy sultry day hath cast This dewdrop from its matin hour. ‘In her thou lov'st the times gone by; In her the joys possessed—not missed:— It was not Hope, but Memory Thy dreaming lids that bent and kissed. ‘In her the dawning lawns forlorn Thou lov'st; the lights along them flung The witcheries of the wakening morn; The echo of its latest song. ‘Thou tread'st once more Castalia's brink:— Far down, thy youth finds rest from trouble: And thou, that saw'st it slowly sink, Dost watch its latest-breaking bubble.’ XXI.—PSYCHE'S BRIDAL SONG. When now had come the marriage day, The church was decked, and nigh the hour, My Psyche said, ‘One other lay, To bless the bride, and bless the bower!’ My Psyche's eyes in gladness swim; His gladness, doubled in her breast: All that she is, and has, to him She gives, not doubting; and is blest. She walks on air; she lifts her brow Like one inspired:—Such light as flushes The Alps at morn, upon its snow Is stayed, in glory, not in blushes. Her world of dream has ta'en its flight! The shadow passed: the substance came: A Soul that long had fed on light Love touched, and kindled into flame. Ah heart of hearts! ah life of life! My Psyche to another given!— The vow that changes Maid to Wife Is pledged to-day, and heard in Heaven! And must she change? And must that wing So soaring, leave its native sky? Then, fairest, purest, o'er thee fling The lightest-robed mortality! Ah! now her other life begins; The soft submission, humble pride; The smile tear-dipp'd; the loss that wins; The life transfused and multiplied! Even now, large heart, thy wish is this:— That from that altar love might stream, And bathe a sorrowing world in bliss! That wish shall end not like a dream. Good works, good will, shall round her spread; The desert blossom, and the waste: The poor man's prayer her golden head Shall crown with lustres ne'er displaced. Go now, my Psyche: meet the throngs That sprinkle flowers and banners wave;— Take, Psyche, take, my last of songs; And keep a garland for a grave. SONNETS WRITTEN IN TRAVEL. I. GIOTTO'S CAMPANILE AT FLORENCE. Enchased with precious marbles, pure and rare, How gracefully it soars, and seems the while From every polished stage to laugh and smile, Playing with gleams of that clear southern air! Fit resting-place methinks its summit were For a descended Angel! happy isle Mid life's rough sea of sorrow, force, and guile, For Saint of royal race, or vestal fair, In this seclusion—call it not a prison— Cloistering a bosom innocent and lonely: O Tuscan Priestess! gladly would I watch All night one note of thy loud hymn to catch Sent forth to greet the sun, when first, new-risen, He shines on that aërial station only! II. OLD PICTURES AT FLORENCE. Thrice happy they who thus before man's eyes Restored the placid image of his prime; Illustrating th' abortive shows of Time With gleams authentic caught from Paradise. Those Godlike forms are men! Impure disguise By us now suffered! O for wings to climb Once more to Virtue's mountain seats sublime, And be what here we poorly recognise! From these fair pictures our Humanity Looks down upon us kindly. 'Tis no dream: Truth stands attested by Consistency; And all the Virtues here in peace supreme So meet, so blend, that in those Forms we see, The sum of all we are and fain would be. III. ON A PICTURE BY COREGGIO AT PARMA. Paint thou the pearl gates of the Morning Star, Loftiest of Painters, and the loveliest; For only of thy pencil worthy are Those ever-smiling mansions of the blest! Thyself when homeward summoned to thy rest Couldst scarce have marked our earth's receding bar: No happier shapes could greet thee, near or far, Than oft in life thy radiant fancy drest. God, when He framed the earth, beheld it good: The light from His approving smile that shone For thee waned never from her features wan: Before thine eyes—unfallen if unrenewed— Still moved that Race supreme and fairest made; And Love and Joy, twin stars, still on their foreheads played. IV. COREGGIO'S CUPOLAS AT PARMA. Creatures all eyes and brows, and tresses streaming, By speed divine blown back:—within, all fire Of wondering zeal, and storm of bright desire; Round the broad dome the immortal throngs are beaming: With elemental Powers the vault is teeming: We gaze, and, gazing, join the fervid choir, In spirit launched on wings that ne'er can tire, Like those that buoy the breasts of children dreaming. The exquisitest hand that e'er in light Revealed the subtlest smile of new-born pleasure, Here sounds the abysses, and attains the height, Is strong the strength of heavenly hosts to measure, Draws back the azure curtain of the skies, And antedates our promised Paradise. V. TO ITALY. O Italy, how beautiful thou wert, If in thee dwelt an answerable soul! Fair in each feature, perfect in each part, That, that thou lack'st which should inspire the whole: Thine are all gifts of nature, all of art; Yet a slow sadness we cannot control Steals, as we gaze, o'er the dejected heart, And our checked passion meets too soon its goal. Beyond the mark of Virtue thou hast shot (For only Virtue's ornaments are thine) And so fallen short of Greatness. Solid Thought, Strength, courage, prudence—all, save Truths divine, Thou hast corrupted. Therefore falls thy hand, Prone, and unsceptred of its old command. VI. GENOA. Ah! what avails it, Genoa, now to thee That Doria, feared by monarchs, once was thine? Univied ruin! in thy slow decline From virtuous greatness, what avails that he Whose prow descended first the Hesperean sea, And gave our world her mate beyond the brine, Was nurtured, whilst an infant, at thy knee? All things must perish—all but things divine. Flowers, and the stars, and Virtue; these alone, The self-subsisting shapes, or self-renewing, Survive. All else are sentenced. Wisest were That builder who should plan with strictest care Ere yet the wood was felled or hewn the stone, The aspect only of his pile in ruin! VII. A PICTURE BY ANDREA DEL SARTO, IN THE CATHEDRAL OF PISA. Are there not virtues which we know not of, By men unnamed because not met with here, Perchance too lofty for this lowly sphere, Our great and glorious heritage above, Yet here in virtues which we know and love Dimly foreshown? Thus dimly to the seer, Rehearsed in humbler kinds that round us move The sovran attributes of man appear. Madonna! I have hung day after day On thy strange beauty with a devout eye; And now, all marvel, rapture, ecstasy Rebuked, or harmonised, or worn away, I gaze; and ask what I have asked; and stay Lingering, and vainly hoping a reply. VIII. THE RENAISSANCE, AND SAVONAROLA.—1. Painter, that on these sacred convent walls The symbols paintest of the fleeting Hours, Reserve thine art, poor spoil from Pagan bowers, To deck withal the rich man's secular halls! Are these the Hours? aërial Bacchanals With urn down-bent or basket heaped with flowers, Through sunshine borne, light Zephyr's paramours? —Thralls though we be, we are not Pleasure's thralls! When God with thunder and his prophet's voice The temples where of old he chose to dwell Chooses to shake in judgment, cleanse or quell, How impious sounds thy summons to rejoice! Erase thy work; kneel on the tombstones bare: Thine eye with fastings purge: make firm thy hand with prayer. IX. THE RENAISSANCE, AND SAVONAROLA.—2. Then rise, and paint the Hours; and launch them forth Like sequent arrows hurled from God's right hand, Or eagles of the ocean borne to earth By solid storm their wings no more withstand: Yet, calm in speed, a stern, predestined band, In meditative might or gloomy mirth Speed them, dread forms of elemental birth; And let one bear the trump, and one the brand. Fix thou their mighty eyes the dark locks under Massed o'er their fervid foreheads, like a cloud Whose heart is flame: and be their faces bowed, As though they listened to unsleeping thunder; The breaking of the billows of Time's sea On the far confines of Eternity. X. FRESCOES BY MASACCIO, AT FLORENCE. Well hast thou judged that sentence, ‘Had ye Faith, Ye could move mountains.’ In those forms I see What God at first created man to be; His image crowned, triumphant over death. Born of that Word which never perisheth Those Prophets here resume the empery By sin in Eden lost. Their eye, their breath Cancels disease; lays prone the anarchy Of Passion's fiercest waves. Secret as Fate, Like Fate's the powers they wield are infinite: Their very thoughts are laws: their will is weight: On as they move in majesty and might The demons yield their prey, the graves their dead: And to her centre Earth is conscious of their tread. XI. SAINTS BY PIETRO PERUGINO. Glory to God of all fair things the maker For that He dwelleth in the mind of Man! Glory to Man of that large grace partaker For that he storeth thus his spirit's span With shapes our earth creates not, neither can, Till, like a flood, her vanished youth o'ertake her, And heaven's ‘New Song’ to loftier labours wake her, High artist then, as now poor artisan. Mark, mark those awful sons of Martyrdom, With their uplifted hands, but eyes down-cast. As though the uncreated light had dazed them:— The error of our brief existence past They stand like Saints resurgent from the tomb, Suspended still on that great Voice which raised them! XII. PICTURE OF A SAINT. Dark, infinitely dark, a midnight blue Those orbs that, resting on the skies, appear To pierce the veil of Heaven and wander through, Searching the centre of the starry sphere. Angels, be sure, unseen are hovering near! Their fanning plumes with faintest blush imbue That pearly cheek, a lily else in hue, And from that brow the auburn tresses clear. One hand is laid upon her mantled breast To us an unrevealèd paradise, Nor bodied in the ascetic Painter's dream: Hidden it lies in everlasting rest Beneath those purple robes that earthward stream Cyphered with star-emblazoned mysteries. XIII. A NIGHT ON THE GENOESE RIVIERA. Fanned by sweet airs the road along the cliff Wound in the moonlight, glistening now, now dim; So winds a silver snake in pale relief Girdling a sacrificial beaker's brim: Black rocks loomed forth in giant hieroglyph O'er silken seas: amid their shadows grim From lowly town dim-lit, or dancing skiff, At times the song was borne, at times the hymn. Star after star adown the blue vault sliding Their bright hair washed successive in the wave, Till morning, from her far purpureal cave Issuing, and o'er the foamless billows gliding, Leaped, as the bells rang out from tower and shrine, Up from her sea-bath to the hills of pine. XIV. BOCCACCIO AND CERTALDO. The world's blind pilgrims, tendering praise for blame, Passing Certaldo, point and smile and stare And with Boccaccio's triumph din the air:— Ah, but for him how high had soared thy fame, Italian Song! False Pleasure is a flame That brands the Muses' pleasaunce; burns it bare As some volcanic isle with barren glare: O Italy! exult not in thy shame! 'Twas here, 'twas here thy Song's immortal river Lost its last sight of hoar Parnassus' head, And swerved through flowery meads to sandy bar: Its saintly mission here it spurned for ever: It sighed to Laura, and with Tancred bled: But caught no second flash from Dante's star! XV. THE CAMPO SANTO AT PISA.—1. There needs not choral song, nor organs pealing: This mighty cloister of itself inspires Thoughts breathed like hymns from spiritual choirs; While shades and lights, in soft succession stealing, Along it creep, now veiling, now revealing Strange forms, here traced by Painting's earliest sires, Angels with palms; and purgatorial fires; And Saints caughtup, and demons round them reeling. Love, long remembering those she could not save, Here hung the cradle of Italian Art: Faith rocked it; hence, like hermit child, went forth That heaven-born Power which beautified the earth: She perished when the world had lured her heart From her true friends, Religion and the grave. XVI. THE CAMPO SANTO AT PISA.—2. Lament not thou: the cold winds, as they pass Through the ribbed fret-work with low sigh or moan, Lament enough; let them lament alone, Counting the sere leaves of the innumerous grass With thin, soft sound like one prolonged—‘alas!’ Spread thou thy hands on sun-touched vase, or stone That yet retains the warmth of sunshine gone, And drink warm solace from the ponderous mass. Gaze not around thee. Monumental marbles, Time-clouded frescoes, mouldering year by year, Dim cells in which all day the night-bird warbles, These things are sorrowful elsewhere, not here: A mightier Power than Art's hath here her shrine: Stranger! thou tread'st the soil of Palestine! XVII. TASSO'S HOUSE AT SORRENTO. O Leonora, here thy Tasso dwelt, Secure, ere yet thy beauty he had seen: Here with bright face and unterrestrial mien He walked, ere yet thy shadow he had felt: From that green rock he watched the sunset melt, On through the waves: yon cavern was his screen When first those hills, which gird the glowing scene, Were thronged with heavenly warriors, and he knelt To hail the vision! Syren baths to him Were nothing; Pagan grot, or classic fane, Or glistening pavement seen through billows dim: Far, far o'er these he gazed on Judah's plain, And more than manhood wrought was in the boy— Why did the Stranger meddle in his joy? XVIII. CASTELAMARE. O cool and healthful nights! O peaceful gloom! O winding sands that in your beauteous zone Clasp the dim watery plain, how oft alone I paced your marge, inhaling the perfume Which forests bursting with invisible bloom Poured from their mountain ambush! Moon was none: But with such strength the lamp of Venus shone, Descending nightly over Virgil's tomb, That, like the moonbeam, her long lustre lay On distant waves to meet that radiance swelling; A long bright ladder from the Star of Love Touched, as it seemed, our lower world. Above, The nightingale her sorrows wept away; And all the echoes of her wrong were telling. XIX. A MORNING AT SALERNO. Our hearts heaved slowly as that deep blue flood Along whose marge we paced. More darkly blue, Through lines of poplars gleaming on our view, The violet crescent of the mountains stood: Unblemished morning, shy as Maidenhood, Rose blushing from the waves, and round us threw A gradual halo, reddening through its dew The silvery greenness of the willow wood— Small clouds unnumbered swollen with golden glories Swam in succession long of lucent fleeces O'er all the ocean-isles and promontories;— That old-world Faith, which sees whate'er it pleases, Had deemed Saint Agnes up the heavenly Eden Her mild immaculate flock was gently leading! XX. TO NAPLES. Queen of the sunny South, in grace reclined O'er thy voluptuous bath, and warmed for ever By beams that make thy nerves in rapture shiver, From yonder Syren Islands silver-shrined Smiles, such as strike the loftier vision blind, Beckoning to thee each morning shoot and quiver: They sting the languor of thine amorous fever: And Syren voices swell each passing wind. But from the other coast, and yet more near, The Sibyl's whisper, with that music bent, Creeps slowly o'er the waters. Hear, O hear! She speaks of buried cities, mountains rent; Of Pleasure stifled in her mid career, Fire-lifted isle, and fire-drowned continent! XXI. THE SIBYL'S CAVE AT CUMA. Cumæan Sibyl! from thy sultry cave Thy dark eyes level with the sulph'rous ground Through the gloom flashing, roll in wrath around! What see they? Coasts perpetual Earthquakes pave With ruin; piles half buried in the wave; Wrecks of old times in later lava drowned;— And festive crowds, sin-steeped and myrtle-crowned, Like idiots dancing on a Parent's grave. And they foresee. Those pallid lips with pain Suppress their thrilling whispers. Sibyl, spare! Could Wisdom's voice divide yon sea, and scare With some Vesuvius new its flaming plane, Futile the warning! Power despised! forbear To deepen guilt by counsel breathed in vain! XXII. THE RUINS OF CORNELIA'S HOUSE AT BAIA. I turn from ruins of imperial power, Tombs of corrupt delight, old walls the pride Of statesmen pleased for respite brief to hide Their laurell'd foreheads in the Muse's bower, And seek Cornelia's home. At sunset's hour How oft her eyes, that wept no more, descried Yon purpling hills! how oft she heard that tide Fretting as now low cave or hollow tower! The mother of the Gracchi—Scipio's child— 'Twas virtue such as hers that built her Rome! Never towards it she gazed! Far off, her home She made, like her great Father self-exiled. Woe to the nations when the souls they bare, Their best and bravest, choose their rest elsewhere! XXIII. VENICE BY DAY. The splendour of the Orient, here of old Throned with the West upon a waveless sea, Her various-vested, resonant jubilee Maintains, though Venice hath her freedom sold: In their high stalls of azure and of gold Yet stand, above the servile concourse free, Those brazen steeds the Car of Victory Hither from far Byzantium's porch that rolled. The wingèd Lions, Time's dejected thralls, Glare with furled plumes. The pictured shapes that glow Like sunset clouds condensed upon the walls Still boast old wars, or feasts of long ago: And still the sun his amplest glory pours On all those swelling domes and ocean floors. XXIV. VENICE IN THE EVENING. Alas! mid all this pomp of the ancient time, And flush of modern pleasure, dull Decay O'er the bright pageant breathes her shadow grey: As on from bridge to bridge I roam and climb It seems as though some wonder-working chime, Whose spell that pageant raised and still can sway, To some far source were ebbing fast away; As though, by man unheard, with voice sublime It bade the sea-born Queen of Cities follow Her Sire into his ocean realm far down— Beneath my fleet the courts sound vast and hollow; And more than Evening's darkness seems to frown On sable barks that, swift yet trackless, fleet Like dreams o'er dim lagune and water-street. XXV. LEONARDO'S ‘LAST SUPPER’ AT MILAN. Come! if thy heart be pure, thy spirits calm, If thou hast no dark memories, or but those Pure self-reproach inflicts—ah no, bestows; Her wounds, here probed, find here their gentlest balm. O the sweet sadness of that lifted palm! The dreadful Deed to come His lips disclose: Yet love and awe, not wrath, that count'nance shows, As though they sang even now that ritual psalm Which closed the Feast piacular. Time hath done His work on this fair picture; but that Face His outrage awes. Stranger! the mist of years, Between thee hung and half its heavenly grace, Hangs there, a fitting veil; nor that alone— They see it best who see it through their tears! XXVI. THE CHURCH OF ST. AMBROSE AT MILAN. Here still remains the Apostolic Chair Whence good Saint Ambrose, patriarchal man, Thy spiritual sceptre swayed, Milan! Yonder the Font, divine Augustine, where The life that never ends for thee began; And—near as death to life—behold them there! Those Gates, to him the portals of despair, Whose closing spake the blood-stained Emperor's ban. He, the world's master, and her lord, as one By lightning smitten on his noon-tide throne, Fell from his pride, and without speech departed: While thou, dejected Afric's humblest son, To seats a Mother's tears had made thine own With regal step didst mount, no longer feeble-hearted. XXVII. THE STATUE OF ST. CARLO BORROMEO AT ARONA. True fame is this;—through love, and love alone, To stand thus honour'd where we first saw day: True puissance this; the hand of lawful sway In love alone to lift, that hand whereon, Dove-like, Eternal Peace hath fixed her throne, And whence her blessing wings o'er earth its way;— True rule to God belongs. Who share it? They Through whom God's gifts on human kind are strewn. Bless thus thy natal place, great Priest, for ever! And thou, Arona, by thy placid bay Second thy sleepless Shepherd's mute endeavour. The choice is thine, if that high Grace, like showers Of sunbeams rain'd on all thy hearths and bowers, Shall feed thy growth, or quicken thy decay! XXVIII. THE MILANESE SCHOOL. What memory of a being ere his birth Possessed Luini with the idea strange Of that Sibylline beauty? Hall or grange, Palace or Hut, whate'er we know on earth, Holds nothing like it. Sadness here and mirth So blend, or so into each other range, We deem them ancient foemen that exchange Love-vows, and sit henceforth beside one hearth. Those half-closed eyes with mournful penetration Look on through all things; yet a furtive smile Brightens her thin, smooth, shadowy face the while:— Methinks that subtle-visaged creature hears The narrowing thread of Life in soft gyration Drawn out; or closing of the Parcæ's shears! XXIX. THE CATHEDRAL OF MILAN. With steps subdued, silence, and labour long, I reached the marble roofs: A we vanquished dread:— White shone they as the summit of Mont Blanc When noontide parleys with that mountain's head: The far-off Alps, by morning tinged with red, Blushed through the spires that round in myriads sprung: A silver gleam the wind-stirred poplars flung O'er Lombardy's green sea below me spread. Of these I little saw. In trance I stood, Ere death, methought, admitted to the skies: Around me, like a heavenly multitude Crowning some specular mount of Paradise, Thronged that Angelic Concourse robed in stone. The sun, ascending, in their faces shone! XXX. BYZANTINE MOSAICS AT RAVENNA. Traced on dim gold, in azure vaults enshrined, Dreary adornments of each glaring space, Those figures lean lack not a terrible grace! Like cloud-rack dragged along the wintry wind Forth stream at large their grey locks unconfined: A vulture's foot each hand might seem: each face Reports of wilds where, 'mid the ferine race, Couched hungry seers and prophets vigil-blind. Rocks, forests, caves, before me rise austere! And that strong Church in childhood wandering wide, By visions nursed, by tempests lullabied: And hymns of warlike blast I seem to hear; Victorious hymns no pen of scribe records:— Fly, scattered Fiends! stand back, terrestrial Lords! XXXI. TO A MOUNTAIN IN SWITZERLAND.—1. From all the glittering towers and spires star-bright That fret thy crystal bastions far below, With what an awful grace yon dome of snow Ascends, and, swelling, grows upon our sight, White as an infant's spirit, or the might Of grey hairs in a monarch! Soft and slow Dark clouds across thy Pine-wood vesture flow, But touch not, mountain king, that sovran height. The avalanche, borne down in rocky flood, Thunders unechoed 'mid those seats divine: And heaven's great diadem of starry globes Is all thou seest, for thine own white robes Cancel the world—Never shall foot of mine Assail the region of thy solitude! XXXII. TO A MOUNTAIN IN SWITZERLAND.—2. Lead to this spot Ambition's outcast son, With unslaked hopes burning from youth to age; That snowy vault, its latest crimson flown, With cold aspèct his fever shall assuage: Lead hither him who, captive in the cage Of love remembered when the loved is gone, Feeds on one thought, and that a poisonous one; Haply that free expanse may disengage His heart from earth—that region whence there seems To heaven but one step only. To this spot Be thou, bewildered maniac, also brought; Gaze on that calmness, and forget thy dreams, While noontide slumbers on its breezeless height, While kissed by rose-lipped Morn, or crowned by starry Night. XXXIII. TO A MOUNTAIN IN SWITZERLAND.—3. The Spirits of the midnight and noonday On thee, hoar Mount, obsequiously attend; Within thy skirts shadow and sunlight play; And the stars hail thee as their earthly friend: From their immortal charge the Twins descend; The Plough awhile forgets his heavenly way; The Pleiads from their shining cloisters stray; And the crowned Archer doth his bow unbend. Thy vastness draws the sphere above thee nearer: —Or is it that our hearts by thee are raised; And, strengthened thus, delight with vision clearer To pore on starry wonders unamazed, Earth's noblest shape forsaking for the sky, As life when sweetest makes it sweet to die? XXXIV. THE CHAPEL OF TELL ON THE LAKE LUCERNE. On this green platform with its chapel small Embowered, the centre of the mountain land, Take, holy Freedom, take for aye thy stand; And hither from all regions ever call Thy sons to thy perpetual festival: Or bid them drink, a sacramental band, From Grutli's founts, that rose at thy command There where the three Deliverers vowed the fall Of Powerunjust. Nightheard those whispered tones;— Have they not found large echoes in the world? Have they not been like God's own thunder hurled In ruin down on all opprobrious thrones? All sway that, deifying lawless might, On that doth build, and not on God and on the right? XXXV. THE LAKE OF LUCERNE. In shape a Cross, and walled with cliffs so high That o'er each aisle of that quadruple plain No unfit roof appears the vaulted sky, It lies, a vast and crystal-paven fane, A Church, by Nature built, and not in vain Among the shadowing Mountains; to supply For all thy sons and suppliants, Liberty, A shrine of ample girth, and free from stain. But thou, O Freedom! bid them gaze with fear And love, upon Tell's birthplace, not on thee! An awful thing art thou, not less than dear: Unpurged no eye thy form unveiled should see: Temples their hearts should be who hope to gain thee— The sword may win, but Virtue must retain thee! XXXVI. How bright, how calm, how gentle, and how great The soul should grow, ere yet for such a scene, So sweet, so pure, so lofty, so serene, It were an equal or an answering mate! All day upon my heart there hung a weight; And whence I knew not. Beauty seemed to lean, Heavy for once, upon a breast, I ween, Till now to catch her faintest smile elate. But now the cause of that depression known, The pain itself has left me; rather say, In aspiration upward it has flown From the dark altar of this heart of clay: And I tread firmly, though by conscience chidden, A guest permitted—yet a guest unbidden. XXXVII. THE MOUNTAIN MUSE. Where shall we spread the couch of thy repose, For here below thou find'st no worthy dwelling? Rise then where Alp o'er Alp, like clouds up-swelling, Above th' attempt of eagle's wing enclose Inviolate spaces of suspended snows: There, while the floods far down are faintly knelling, And hooded Evening, star by star, is telling Her rosary dim-seen through skies of rose, There, thy large eyes stedfast and open keeping, Olympia, rest! what time in mournful choir The mighty winds, through endless pinewoods sweeping, Draw from those chords, their melancholy lyre, Eolian tones of elemental weeping, And the last gleams of dying day expire. XXXVIII. THE BLUE GENTIAN. With heart not yet half rested from Mont Blanc, O'er thee, small flower, my wearied eyes I bent, And rested on that humbler vision long: Is there less beauty in thy purple tent Outspread, perchance a boundless firmament, O'er viewless myriads which beneath thee throng, Than in that Mount whose sides, with ruin hung, Frown o'er black glen and gorges thunder-rent? Is there less mystery? Wisely if we ponder, Thine is the mightier! Life, dread Power, in thee Is strong as in cherubic wings that wander Searching the limits of Infinity, Life, life to be transmitted, not to expire Till yonder snowy vault shall melt in the last fire! XXXIX. THE MOUNTAIN LANGUAGE. Silent to watch great rivers at their rise, And downward track them to the murmuring deep; The sunlit storm to follow as it flies Broken through purple glens; in lingering sweep To hear the forest sigh, the torrent leap; These things, great Nature's tragic agonies, What lesson teach they which the soul should prize As precious, and the memory strive to keep? ‘Lift up your hearts!’ O strange and mystic words! Sounds truly eucharistic! Nothing mean Is heard in them, or common, or unclean. This is the mountain language. Sense affords The instrumental medium: but the Spirit Draws near in faith; and God, that hour, is near it! XL. A TYROLESE VILLAGE. This village, thronged with churches, needeth none: Each house, like some old missal rich and quaint, Is blazoned o'er with prophet, seer, and saint: Each court and street a sanctity hath won: Here a great Angel stands, crowned with the sun: Magdalene there pours her perpetual plaint: There o'er her child the Maiden without taint Bends—as His mercy bends o'er worlds undone. Of earth's proud centres none like this recalls That mystic City in the realms supernal Built upon God; whose light is God alone: The very stones cry out: the eloquent walls Plainly confess that Name the proud disown; The Father's glory, and the Son Eternal. TO THE LORD EMLY THESE POEMS ARE DEDICATED BY HIS FRIEND AND KINSMAN AUBREY DE VERE. THE AUTUMN OF THE SPRING. I saw at morn the locks your hands Last summer crowned with ill-earned bay, And marked a silver thread, and looked Another way. Amid the woods to-day I saw An unloved sight till then unseen— A golden bough, a crimson leaf, Among leaves green. When first we roamed those woods, the lark Chanted to God her cherub song; To his fond mate the uxorious thrush Sang low, and long. The wood-dove murmured to herself Of restful Truth and Joy love-won: The cuckoo's note dissolved in heaven, Like snow in sun. And all the birds in lawns rock-girt And all the birds in sylvan cells Blew loud their jewelled flutes and chimed Their silver bells. But ah! to-day upon the bough I saw the wintry redbreast stand; Like mourner's ring he seemed on some New-plighted hand. His head he tossed, and twittered shrill As one who cared not what he sung: The pine-tree's fallen cone I snatched, And at him flung. Soothe thou the winter! but thy note Troubles, not cheers, the autumnal glen: Off, bird! nor shake the unsteady hearts Of maids and men! SONG. Seek not the tree of silkiest bark And balmiest bud, To carve her name—while yet 'tis dark— Upon the wood. The world is full of noble tasks, And wreaths hard-won: Each work demands strong hearts, strong hands, Till day is done. Sing not that violet-veinèd skin That cheek's pale roses; The lily of that form wherein Her soul reposes! Forth to the fight, true man, true knight! The clash of arms Shall more prevail than whispered tale To win her charms. The warrior for the True, the Right, Fights in Love's name: The love that lures thee from that fight Lures thee to shame. That love which lifts the heart, yet leaves The spirit free, That love, or none, is fit for one Man-shaped like thee. [Heart wingèd once; self-doomed] Heart wingèd once; self-doomed To pine in bonds the saddest: Strong spirit, self-entombed Within the vaults thou madest: Thy Will it is, thy Will That holds thee prisoner still! O Soul, in vain thou strainest Against thy prison bar; Of all vain things the vainest Our poor, half efforts are. Wholly be free!—till then Thou dost but hug thy chain. SONG. Though oft beguiled, my friend, before, Still, still permit me to beguile: Denounce not harshly, but deplore My laugh, and it may end a smile. To children more akin than you We women are—we give them birth— If we are sometimes childish too, Be men, nor war on childish mirth! Once on my head your hand you laid; I shook it thence;—but 'twas an art To hide from you how near it weighed On that which shook beneath—my heart. Go not! be cold; be stern; be mute; Yet stay: lest I, who cannot choose But tremble sometimes at thy suit, At last should tremble to refuse. A FAREWELL TO NAPLES. I. A glorious amphitheatre whose girth Exceeds three-fold th' horizons of the north, Mixing our pleasures in a goblet wide, With hard, firm rim through clear air far-descried; Illumined mountains, on whose heavenly slopes Quick, busy shades rehearse, while Phœbus drops, Dramatic parts in scenic mysteries; Far-shadowing islands, and exulting seas With cities girt, that catch, till day is done, Successive glances from the circling sun And cast a snowy gleam across the blue; A gulf that, to its lake-like softness true, Reveres the stillness of the Syren's cell, Yet knows the ocean's roll, and loves it well; A gulf where Zephyr oft, with noontide heat Oppressed, descends to bathe his sacred feet, And, at the first cold touch at once reviving, Sinks to the wings in joy, before him driving A feathery foam into the lemon groves; Evasive, zone-like sands and secret coves; Translucent waves that, heaved with motion slow, On fanes submerged a brighter gleam bestow; Fair hamlets, streets with odorous myrtles spread, Bruised by processions grave with soundless tread, That leave, the Duomo entered, on the mind A pomp confused, and music on the wind; Smooth, mounded banks like inland coasts and capes, That take from seas extinct their sinuous shapes, And girdle plains whose growths, fire-fed below, Without the bending labourer burst and blow; A light Olympian and an air divine— Naples! if these are blessings, they are thine. II. Thy sands we paced in sunlight and soft gloom; From Tasso's birthplace roamed to Virgil's tomb: Baia! thy haunts we trod, and glimmering caves Whoseambushed ardours pant o'er vine-decked waves Thy cliffs we coasted, loitered in thy creeks, O shaggy island Capri. with the five great peaks! Explored thy grotto, scaled that fortress where Thy dark-eyed maids trip down the rocky stair, With glance cast backward, laugh of playful scorn, And cheek carnationed with the lights of morn. The hills Lactarean lodged us in their breast: Shadowy Sorrento to her spicy nest Called us from far with gales embalmed, yet pure; Her orange brakes we pierced, and ranged her rifts obscure. Breathless along Pompeii's streets we strayed By songless fount, mosaic undecayed, Voluptuous tomb, still forum, painted hall, Where wreathed Bacchantès float on every wall, Where Ariadne by the purple deep Hears not those panting sails, but smiles in sleep, Where yet Silenus grasps the woodland cup, And buried Pleasure from its grave looks up: Lastly, the great Vesuvian steep we clomb; Then, Naples! made once more with thee our home. We leave thee now: but first, with just review, We cast the account, and strike the balance true: And thus, as forth we fare, we take our last adieu. III. From her whom Genius never yet inspired, Nor virtue raised, nor pulse heroic fired; From her, who in the grand historic page, Maintains one barren blank from age to age; From her, with insect life and insect buzz, Who, evermore unresting, nothing does; From her who, with the future and the past No commerce holds, no structure rears to last; From streets where spies and jesters, side by side, Range the rank markets, and their gains divide; Where Faith in Art, and Art in Sense is lost, And toys and gewgaws form a nation's boast; Where Passion, from Affection's bond cut loose, Revels in orgies of its own abuse; And Appetite, from Passion's portals thrust, Creeps on its belly to its grave of dust; Where Vice her mask disdains, where Fraud is loud, And naught but Wisdom dumb and Justice cowed;— Lastly, from her who planted here unawed 'Mid heaven-topped hills, and waters bright and broad, From these but nerves more swift to err hath gained, And the dread stamp of sanctities profaned, And, girt not less with ruin, lives to show That worse than wasted weal is wasted woe,— We part, forth issuing through her closing gate With unreverting faces, not ingrate. LINES WRITTEN AT HALSTEADS. Four years ago beside this lake O'er which the mountain shadows close, I walked in sadness for the sake Of one that could no more partake That grave joy it bestows. ‘Since she is gone,’ I said, ‘ah why Have they not here her ashes laid? Here strayed her feet in infancy: The studious girl was glad to lie Under yon oak-tree's shade. ‘By Old-Church, dear to her, a spot Once consecrate, twice sanctified, Beneath its yew she slumbers not, Nor in the adjoining garden plot, Nor by the water's side. ‘Ah that but once the lark might sing Above his sister Poet's bed! For she sang also. Ah that Spring Her tardy northern flowers might fling O'er that belovèd head!’ Such thoughts were mine: the mood is gone; Once more, I stand this lake beside: Maturer thoughts, and wisdom won From years that like a dream are flown, Cheer me instead, yet chide. As deeply, with a purer heart, She loved these mountains which I love, And, loving, left them. Torn apart From them and from the Poet's art, She neither wept nor strove. Amid the stress of daily life She, for ethereal stillness framed, Advanced, 'mid scenes for others rife With petty troubles, care, and strife, Uncrippled and unmaimed. The call of Duty was a call To her more constant and more strong Than voice of wintry waterfall Which from the mountain's echoing wall Increases all night long. The humblest tasks of day and hour, If Duty's light around them shone, Challenged her breast with mightier power Than Placefell's brow or Yewcrag's bower Illumed by moon or sun. We dwell not in the sacred fane, But seek for strength supernal there, Elsewhere to use it. Not in vain Did vales and hills her youth sustain, For loftier loves prepare. In crowded street and clamorous mews Her face its placid candour kept: Her heart, like flowers refreshed by dews The mountain's noontide mists diffuse, In endless sabbath slept. To all her gentle ways was bound A grace from woodland memories caught: Her voice retained that touching sound, Pathos not plaintive though profound, Contented rills first taught. Surely in sleep the torrents poured For her their requiem; and the wind, And many a valley wind-explored, Answering in full harmonic chord, Their solemn burthen joined. In dreams unvanquished by the dawn She saw red dawn the darkness rout, Gradations saw of mountain lawn, And ridge behind ridge far withdrawn In ‘linkèd sweetness long drawn out;’ Saw tracts high up of whitening grass, Sunshine of Earth when Heaven's had failed, The crimson Birch-grove's feathery mass By rain drops in a warm, still pass With silver drapery veiled. The dark gold of the autumnal gorse, The auburn of the faded fern, She saw. Thy murmur, Aira Force! Kept pure its Arethusan course, 'Mid dirge of billows stern. If ever now she moves to earth That eye fast fixed upon the Throne, In vale or city, south or north, What sees she? All things nothing worth, Save virtuous tasks well done. Then rightly rests in death her head Where life to her its duties gave: Among the poor she clothed and fed, And taught, and loved, and comforted, Rightly remains her grave. WRITTEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CRIMEAN WAR. From polar wastes and sunless mines, And prone expanse of snows and sands, Whereon, while shadowing eve declines, The solitary Exile stands; From lost Circassia's branded coasts, Danubian deserts black with fire, From putrid swamps where conscript hosts A foe behold not, yet expire; At last ascending, claim your place, Nor fear to answer ban with ban, And smite the Insulter on his face, Ye manlier Faculties of man, That, long in rising, rise at last; And, winged with lightning, thunder-zoned, The turrets shake, and scare the feast Of malefactors crowned and throned. The blood of Catherine fires the Czar: Teach it less proudly to rebel! False priests baptise an impious war: The homicidal synods quell! From Arctic regions, and the shore Medea left of old, make way! The heart of Poland beats once more: The nuns of Minsk await their day! A WANDERER'S MUSINGS AT ROME. Thanks be to heaven! yon grove of sombre pines Whose several tops, like feathers in one wing Folded o'er one another, hang in air, From the great City hides me! From its sound, Low but mysterious, urgent, agitating, Not distance only, but those rifted walls Immense (how oft at noontide have I watched The long green lizard from their fissures glance, And glide from thicket-mantled tower to tower) Not less protect me. Thanks once more to Heaven! This nook in which I lie, this grassy isle Amid the burnt brake nested, hath no name: No legend haunts it. Unalarmed I turn, Confronted by no despot from the grave, By no inscription challenged. If this spot Was trod of old by Consul or by King It is my privilege to be ignorant: They lived and died. If here the Roman Twins Tugged at the she-wolf, they have had their day: Yon lambs have theirs; and I, a wearied man, Following the path their feet have worn, here find Their cool recess, and share it. Pretty thrush! Possess thy soul in peace, and sing at will, Sharpening thy clear expostulating note, Or softening, 'mid the branches. Murmuring stream Sufficient to solicit and reward An unconstrained attention, thou to me, A lover of the torrents from my youth This day art dearer far than Alpine floods In whose abysmal voices all the sounds Of all the vales are met and reconciled. From admiration I desire repose; Rest from that household foe, a beating heart; Yea, from all thought exemption, save such thoughts As, lightly wafted towards us, leave us lightly, And, like the salutation of those winds That curl yon ilex leaves, if sweets they bring, Bequeath a sweeter freshness. Three weeks since To me this spot a prison-house had seemed, And hours here spent ignoblest apathy. The change, whence comes it? Fevered nights and days Make answer! Answer thou, mysterious City, Whose shade eclipsed the world a thousand years, Till, in thy citizenship world-wide, the name Of Man at last was lost: make answer, thou! Tomb, aqueduct, and porch I visited, And strove with adulating thoughts to clasp, And could not: for as some vast tree, the sire Of woods, flings off the span of infant arms, So by its breadth and compass Rome rebuked My sympathies. The ‘lesser,’ verily, ‘Is of the greater blessed;’ and Love, a gift, Falls back, repulsed, from that which scorns its aid, From that which, solitary in its vastness, Admits no measurement, nor condescends To be in portions grasped; from that which yields No crevice to the climber's hand or foot; Whose height o'erawes our wingèd aspirations Like some steep cliff of ocean in whose shade The circling sea-birds wail. And yet, too slight With soul-unburdening love to clasp thee, Rome, Much more was I unable to forget. I mused in city wastes where pitying Earth Takes back into her breast huge fragments strewn Around, like bones of savage beasts extinct: From wreck to wreck I roamed: my very dreams Nested in obscure haunts and gloomy vaults: Ruin on ruin pressed, rivals in death, Like grave dislodging grave in churchyard choked: Triumphant Pillar, and vainglorious Arch Towered in blue sky: voluptuous Baths laid bare Colossal Vice: and one great The Pantheon. Temple meet For that promiscuous worship Statecraft loves Lifted its haughty dome and pillared front. I sought Cornelia's house, but found instead The Cæsars' Palace, and the Coliseum, That theatre of blood, where sat enthroned, Swollen with the rage of Roman merriment, The Roman People—Earth's chief idol served With human victims! From its own excess Triumphant Evil suffers confutation: Not here where, tested by the extreme it reached, The Imperial Instinct stands unmasked—not here Can the sword's conquests subjugate the soul: A lucid interval perforce is ours, By these memorials quelled. The race that here Trod down their brethren daily, in their day Might plead some poor excuse. Each war to them Some singular necessity might urge, Or final peace impledge: but we who stand Outfaced by all the congregated trophies They reared that gloried in their shame, who pace O'er Tullia's way to reach Domitian's halls, Who in one choir behold the British Queen And earlier Sabine maid, who hear at once The wail of Veii and the falling roofs Of Carthage, till monotonous becomes The cry of nations, and the tale of blood A tedious iteration; we who scan, Marbled in Rome, the form of injured Earth, Who round us mark trampled Humanity, And trace her wounds, and count each accurate scar In that dread victim by Rome's talon and beak Grav'n and recorded—we are scantly moved On martial sway to dote. What magic, then, Draws us to Rome? What spirit bids the world Send up its tribes to one Metropolis; To her whom many hate—whom many fear— Where lies the spell? Luxurious wealth has spread No velvet o'er the Roman streets, nor hung The spoils of Cashmeer, Persia, Samarcand, On either side the way. No flattering dream Of fame restored, and ancient life renewed, Looks forth from heaven into a young man's eyes, Then drops, and plants its tent on Tyber's bank: The tawny Tyber is no mountain rill Where Fancy slakes her thirst. The sage shrinks back, And in the Roman Sibyl's bleeding book Will read no line— The future here is mortgaged to the past; Hope breathes no temporal promise o'er that plain On which malaria broods: amid the tombs Her foot moves slowly; and where Hope is lame The social forces languish. Whence the spell That draws us, then, to Rome? In arms, no more It lives: abides it ambushed then in Art? The reign of Art is over. To uprear A prostrate column on its crumbling base— Behold her chief of triumphs! Art is dead, Here as in every land. In death gold-robed Her soul-less body, stretched across the street, Blocks up the public way. The artist's study, Of old a hermit's cell, where Mind recluse, Pillowed on stores aforetime wrung from Thought By Passion, by Experience drawn from Life, Saw visions as in Patmos, and set forth The shapes it saw, is now a wrangling shop In all the regal cities of the world, For them that buy and sell. In ancient time The painter was a preacher, whose sage hand Changed Thought to Form. If Martyrdom that thought, The radiant face of confessor unmoved Expressed full well that death which is a birth Into the realms of light. If Faith that thought, Lo! where St. Jerome, eremite and Saint, A dweller among rocks, himself a rock, Wasted and gaunt, fast-worn, and vigil-blind, Dying, draws near in faith, with both hands clasped, And awe-struck lip, to Him the invisible, And on that ‘Last Communion’ hanging, rests The weight of all his being! If he mused On Purity, ah! mark that seer (nor young, Nor female) who a lily holds and reads Writ in its depth the life white-robed of them Who follow still the Lamb! How oft, how gladly, On such fair picture, found in village church Or loncliest convent, has my spirit fed! But here in Rome, the centre once of Art, Here, as elsewhere, her mission Art hath lost: Her health is here in rank abundance drowned. The living paint for profit. Pictures old Are to vainglorious eminence reduced; And, from the spots that gave them meaning torn, In proud and blind confusion hang round halls Where vanity sits umpire. Art of old, Handmaid of Faith—prophet that witness bare Of God, not self, nor came in her own name, Initiate in the Ideal Truth that spans The actual scope of things, and thence advanced To be great Nature's meek Interpreter, Stands now a conquering Queen, and keeps her court In palace halls whose marble labyrinths Are cities peopled by a race of stone. In such what profit? Breathlessly we turn, And sigh for stillness, sigh for utter peace, For darkness, or assuasive twilight drawn In dewy gentleness o'er pastures broad Whose cool serenity of blue and green Lures the tense spirit forth, and in a bath Of relaxation soft soothes and contents it Too much of ostentatious aid unasked! Are we so weak within? Can we advance No step without a crutch? No lessons learn, Save lessons thrust upon us? Can we find In Nature's music manifold no voice But sad confessions of her nothingness? Trust we in dead things only? Nature lives! Her moving clouds, the rapture of her waves, Her rural haunts domestic, nooks sun-warmed Endeared to babe and greybeard, her expanse Of fruitful plains, with hamlet, hall, and tower, Homestead and hedge, in autumn's glistening air Drawn out at eve, or by the ferment dazed Of summer sunrise, or on vernal noon Melting in pearly distance like our dreams For Man's far welfare—her mysterious glens That with the substance of one shade are thronged And others habitant have none, that speak Of God and God alone, transfix the heart With wisdom less imposed on man than won From man's resources. Nature's demonstrations, Maternal, not scholastic, need have none Of diagram: her own face is their proof, Subduing in the pathos of its smiles, Or power of eye: and, being, infinite, Her life is all in every part; her lore In lowliest shape is perfect. Thou frail flower, Anemone! that near my grassy couch, By a breath shaken which I scarcely feel, Thy gracious head as though in worship bowest Down on thy mother's lap, in thee, in thee (I seek no further) lives that Power supreme, Whereof the artists boast. Immaculate Beauty In thy humility doth dominate, Is of thy tremblings proud, and, gladly clothed In thy thin garb of colours and fair forms, Looks up and smiles. I pluck thee from thy bed— Lie lightly on a breast that weary grows Of haughtier burdens! Cool a fevered heart, That seeking better things hath sought in vain! Be thou my monitor: let me sum up: What have I chiefly learned from human life? That life as brief as thine is to be praised: That life's best blessings are the flower-like joys We spurn unseen, chasing inventions vain: That He who made thee, made the heavens and earth, And man; and that in Him is life alone; To serve Him freedom and to know Him peace— Thine ancestress that bloomed in Paradise Possessed no softer voice to celebrate, Joining the visual chorus of all worlds, Her great Creator's glory! Hark that peal! From countless domes that high in sunlight shake A thousand bells roll forth their harmonies: The City, by the noontide flame oppressed, And sheltered long in sleep, awakes. Even now, Along the Pincian steep, with youthful step To dignity subdued, collegiate trains Precede their dark-stoled Teachers. Courts grassgrown That echoed long some fountain's lonely splash, Now ring more loudly, smitten by the wheels Of prince, or prelate of the Church intent On some majestic Rite. That peal again! And now the linked Procession moves abroad, Untwining slowly its voluminous folds: It pauses: through the dusky archway drawn It vanishes: upcoiled at last, and still, Girdling the Coliseum's central Cross, The sacred Pageant rests. With motion soft So slid the Esculapian snake of old Forth from the darkness. In Hesperian isle So rested, coiled around the mystic stem, The Watcher of the fruit. The day draws on: The multitudinous thrill of quickening life Vibrates through all the city: it prevails In convent walks by rustling robe trailed o'er; Like hum of insects unbeheld it throbs Through orange-scented, cloistral gardens dim; It deepens with the concourse onward borne Between those statued Saints that guard thy bridge, St. Angelo, and past the Adrian Tomb Where at the Church's foot an Empire sleeps; It swells within those Colonnades whose arms Receive once more the concourse from all lands— The stately English noble, student pale From Germany, diplomatist from France, Far Grecian Patriarch, or Armenian priest, Or Royal Exile. From thy marble roofs, St. Peter's, in whose fastnesses abide, Like Arab tribe encamped, the bands ordained To guard them from the aggressive elements, From those aërial roofs to whispering depths Of crypt where kneels the cowlèd monk alone, The murmur spreads like one broad wind that lifts, Ere morn the sighing shrouds of fleet becalmed: The churches fill; the relics forth are brought: Screened by rich fretwork the monastic apse Resounds the hoarse chant like an ocean cave: And long ere yet those obelisks, which once Shadowed the Nile, o'er courts Basilican Project their evening shades, like silver stars Before white altars glimmering lights shall burn, And solitary suppliants lift their hands To Christ, for ever Present, to His Saints, And to His Martyrs, whom the Catacombs Hid in their sunless bosoms. Rome, O Rome! Surely thy Strength is here! Three hundred years Thy Faithful lived, and watched among the Tombs; The Catacombs were their Metropolis: There in the darkness thirty Pontiffs ruled; And died, save two, by martyrdom. The Rite, Dread and tremendous, yoking earth and heaven, The Christian Sacrifice, was offered there, A tomb the altar, and, for relics, blood Of him who last confessed. The pictured walls To Mary and to Peter witness still. Here is thy Strength, O Rome! Sun-clad, above, The Emperor triumphed, and the People triumphed! The Nubian lion, and the Lybian pard Roared for their prey! Above thy tawny wave, Tyber, the world's increase went up each day: Daily from Rome the Legions passed whose arms Flashed back in turn the sunrise of all lands: Through every gate the embassies of Kings Advanced with gifts. But in the Catacombs Thy Faithful watched, and, circled by their dead, Worshipped their God in peace. Three hundred years Passed like three days: and lo! that Power went forth Which conquered Death. Then Hell gave up her prey: That hour the kingdoms of this world became The kingdoms of the Lord, and of His Christ: The Prince of this world, from his throne, upreared On subject thrones of every land, was hurled: The Pagan victories then their meaning found: That Empire last and mightiest which absorbed All its precursors, lay a ruin: God His family on earth a Kingdom made And Sion built on buried Babylon! The Sacrament of Obedience paid to God Through Man, His Vicar, glorified that hour, Subjection; and the Apostles reigned at Rome, Reigned from their tombs, and conquered from their dust! Behold the mystery of the ages! Man Wrought it, unconscious! History is mad Or finds its meaning here. One Mystery vast Solves here Philosophy's uncounted riddles: Time with its tumults here is harmonized: Hope here is found or nowhere! As a mist That strives no longer, swept by quiring winds From some peak'd mountain, my oppression leaves me! Great Rome is mine at last! Refreshed I rise; And gales of life from that celestial bourne Whereto we tend strike on me. With soft shock Yon almond bower lets falls its rose-touched snow: The sun is setting. The despotic Day Which, blessing earth with increase, suffered none To lift a grateful eye, hath heard his doom, And round him folds his robes, blood-stained and golden, With dignity to die. Like haughty hopes From one reduced by sickness, from the clouds Their pageantries are passing; and ere long No hue save that translucent, tender green, Will speak of pomps gone by. The increasing wind, Incumbent on the pine-grove's summit broad, Gathers in volumed strength: within its vaults An omnipresent and persistent whisper Waxes in loudness. Well, might I believe The hosts angelic, who with guardian care, Urging belike the seasons in their course, Circle the earth, even now on wings outspread Were rustling o'er me, countless as sea-sands! Glorious and blessed Armies! free ye are From man's uncertainties, and free not less From man's illusions! Passing in one flight Calpë and Athens—all that makes renowned This many-mountained, many-citied globe, To you our schemes of worldly rule must seem Like some poor maniac's towers in charcoal sketched, Airy possession, on his cell's bare wall, Our science like that knowledge won from touch By one born blind, our arts like gems minute, Poor fragments crumbled from your spheres eterne! Pity us, then, bright Spirits, for ye know The weakness of our strength; the poverty Ye know, which we for wealth misdeem—exchanging The gold of Truth Immutable and One, Shared, not divided, for the baser coin Of Truth in portions, scattered through the world. Ye know the sad vacuity of hearts With trifles filled, and thence from Him averse In love for Whom is clasped the love of all things, And their possession. Starlike in your ken, By distance, and the barriers of the realms, And all that haze which men call ancientness, Unfooled ye are. For you the Church of God Unwrinkled as the ocean, wears for aye Her Pentecostal glory. All things that live, And die not—all Realities divine, Live in the light of one eternal Now, And prime perpetual. Him whom we revere As patriarch, ye behold a white-haired babe, Poor, heaven-protected infant of fourscore: His course accomplished, still in him ye note His mother's new delight—a bud dried up; Dropt from the human stem at noon; ere night Blown forth into the darkness. Spirits blest! The sun that runs before you rises ever: For ever sets, reigns ever throned at noon; Past, Present, Future mingle in your sight, And Time its tortuous stream spreads to a lake Girt by, and imaging, Eternity, Between whose mirror and the infinite vault Ye in the radiance bask! Bask on, bright Spirits! Bathe in the beam of Godhead; or fulfil With awe your ministries of love, in Man That seeing which they saw not who of old The Galilean mocked. By death absolved, By perfected Obedience rendered free, Man—by the old-world Empires trod to dust, Man—by the Prince of this world crowned and mocked, Man o'er the ruins of the world shall rise; Yea, from the height of heaven, the throne of God, Shall gaze upon a universe renewed; His Image o'er that universe shall cast And o'er your shining hosts; his hand shall raise; And with the Voice Supreme blending his own, Shall bless you, and pronounce you ‘very good.’ MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. I. Cold, pure, reviving, med'cinable gales, Sea-born, nor charged with breath of herb or flower, That far o'er moonlight seas, perhaps this hour, Trouble some sleeping pilot's whispering sails, And pour into his ear consoling tales Of ivy murmuring round a known church tower; Crystalline airs, in love and pitying power, Serving that God whose love o'er all prevails; Hither in mercy also come, and lean One moment on those lids and o'er this breast! O cooled by all the shadows of your caves, O fresh from mountain snows or loneliest waves, O pure from haunts where man hath never been, Come with ethereal dews and endless rest! II. ON THE DEATH OF A GOOD KING. Honour that dies not, grief that lives for aye, And the benedictions of the suffering poor, Come to thy grave, and there, as at the door Of Heaven, their brows in mute expectance lay; A mighty nation stands uncrowned this day: This day a widowed people's heart is sore; A sire this day each household doth deplore; Each head hath lost its helm, each hand its stay. Great king! a nation smiled upon thy birth; A nation's prayers, each night, kept watch around thee: Now thou obey'st the summons of the earth Behold! a nation's duteous tears have crowned thee: And millions at thy tomb to thee have given A portion of their heart to waft with thee to heaven! III. ON THE FALL OF A USURPER. I wished thee length of years! the courtly crowd Wished it less truly, and less fervently. Thou livest! How many a head miscrowned hath bowed In specious death! The slow shaft missed not thee. Thou livest a posthumous life; reserved to see The Future's verdict—laughter long and loud:— Melted thy throne beneath thee like a cloud; Like snow thy puissance vanished. Mockery Answered when that usurping hand invoked Thy host their hundred thousand swords to bare. Unknown, alone, dethroned because uncloaked, Thou fleddest; nor friend nor foe demanded where. Thou livest! A King Batavian William died:— By which the nations were disedified. 1848. IV. POLAND. Lo, as a prophet, old, and fierce, and gaunt, Spurning the plains, when some detested foe His country, and his country's hearths, lays low, Makes in the mountain walls his caverned haunt; There lurks; thence leans; half blind, yet vigilant, Watches red morning tinge the ensanguined snow; And bends his ear, and says, ‘Thy foot is slow, Deliverer! see thy vengeance be not scant;’— Not otherwise a trampled Nation waits, Regioned in fell resolve; her heart thus feeds On iron; muses thus on coming fates; Revels in rapture of predestined deeds; And finds at last the hour, and finds the way:— Let sceptre-wielding Rebels fear that day! 1848. V. TO THE NOBILITY OF ENGLAND, 1848. Princes of England, undeposed as yet, While panic-stricken thrones around you quake, And perplexed kings themselves their sceptres break, With a firm hand your house in order set: If sound ye be at heart, external threat That soundness can but probe to prove. Awake! Hold fast your birthright for the people's sake: Let high and low discharge their mutual debt. Things hollow must collapse; effete decay: But that which stablished first Nobility— Valour and Truth—if these abide, her stay, While live the nations she can never die. Be true to England: to yourselves be true: And England shall work out her furthest fates by you. VI. ON A CONVENT. Glorious the thought, not mortal the design, Defamed by fools, in earthly hearts to raise Unearthly citadels of prayer and praise; Revering, to renounce all bonds that twine With heavenly, earthly love; through Grace divine To rise o'er Virtue's secondary ways; Hidden to live with God; and, by His gaze Illumed yet veiled, like noontide stars to shine! Glorious the deed each waste and wilderness And isle beleaguered by the raging main To thrill with Christian chaunt and psalmic strain, And make a conquered world her Lord confess! Ye that conventual pomps denounce, begin By fixing in your hearts conventual discipline. VII. A CONVENT SCHOOL IN A CORRUPT CITY. Hark how they laugh, those children at their sport! O'er all this city vast that knows not sleep Labour and Sin their ceaseless vigil keep: Yet hither still good Angels make resort. Innocence here and Mirth a single fort Maintain: and though in many a snake-like sweep Corruption round the weedy walls doth creep, Its track not yet hath slimed this sunny court. Glory to God, who so the world hath framed That in all places children more abound Than they by whom Humanity is shamed! Children outnumber men: and millions die— Who knows not this?—in blameless infancy, Sowing with innocence our sin-stained ground. VIII. The reason why we love thee dost thou ask? We love for many reasons joined in one: Because thy face is fair to look upon; Because, when pains or toils our hearts o'ertask, In sunny smiles of thine thy love to bask; Because thou honourest all, and harmest none: Because thy froward moods so soon are gone: Thy many faults and foibles wear no mask:— Because thou art a woman. Unto me A gracious woman is a child mature; Docile, and gentle, though with many a lure Enriched, and, in a soft subjection, free; A sanguine creature, full of winning ways; Athirst for love, and shyly pleased with praise. IX. TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.—1. Had I been worthy of the love you gave That love withdrawn had left me sad but strong; My heart had been as silent as my tongue; My bed had been unfevered as my grave: I had not striven for what I could not save: Back, back to heaven my great hopes I had flung:— To have much suffered, having done no wrong, Had seemed to me that noble part the brave Account it ever. What this hour I am Affirms the unworthiness that in me lurked: Some sapping poison through my substance worked, Some sin not trivial though it lacked a name, Which ratifies the deed that you have done With plain approval. Other plea seek none. X. TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.—2. Give me one kiss, sweet love, and so farewell! Those magic lips, when they were all my own, To me were dearer than the loftiest throne That ever made a Conqueror's bosom swell. Those youthful eyes retain their luminous spell: Fairer those brows, that droop like flowers o'erblown, For the dim, dubious shadow o'er them thrown: Still on that cheek the pure carnations dwell! —Softly, of infidelity ashamed, Yet with recovered freedom softly pleased, She sighed: her hand unwillingly released, Withdrew, yet something seemed to leave behind:— She's gone! so fleets the fleeting stream unblamed; So fleets the unquestioned cloud, the unchallenged wind! XI. ON A PORTRAIT. A deep still Sorrow, beautiful and bland, Across those brooding brows and eastern eyes Rests, as a broad shade on the mountain lies: How few that Sorrow's cause shall understand! Methinks, the years to come, a tragic band, Move, heard by him, with funeral harmonies, Up life's dim vale: and prescience, vainly wise, Shadows a fair face with prophetic hand. 'Tis but a picture:—Stranger, grief-betrayed, Weep not! The man, not portrait, hadst thou seen, For early death then justly hadst thou prayed To shield the mourner with the grave's kind screen From woes, his portion destined from his birth,— O noble souls, what do ye here on earth? XII. FALSE FRIENDSHIP. Alas, dear friends, we do each other wrong; For we long years in love conjoined have been; Many vicissitudes, and strange, have seen; Joyed oft, wept oft, outgrown our grief ere long; Yet what we were, still are we. Love is strong, Through vigilant hate of all things base and mean, To raise her votaries, and with fire make clean; But we her awful aids away have flung, Over complacent Friendship weakly doted On virtues, oft through dim tears magnified, Till Friendship, o'er-indulgent, scarcely noted The faults hard-by; or, noting, feared to chide; Therefore dishonoured Friendship asks too late, ‘My seat inglorious must I abdicate?’ XIII. Free born, it is my purpose to die free. Away, degrading cares; and ye not less, Delights of sense and gauds of worldliness; I have no part in you, nor you in me. They that walk brave wear the world's livery: Their badge of service is their sumptuous dress: Seek then your prey in gilded palaces; Revere my hovel's humble liberty. Are there no flowers on earth, in heaven no stars, That we must place in such low things our trust? Let me have noble toils, if toil I must, The Patriot's task, or Friendship's sacred cares— Beside my board that man shall break no crust, Who sells his birthright for a feast of dust. XIV. THE POETRY OF LIFE. Dian! thy brother of the golden beams Is hailed for ever as the Lord of Song, Master of manly verse, and mystic dreams: Doth, then, no female lyre to thee belong? Say, is that silver bow whose crescent gleams, Above black pine-woods lifted, or low-hung 'Twixt hornèd rocks, or troubling midnight streams, With immelodious cord, and silent, strung? Ah no, not so! Thou too art musical! The world is full of poetry unwrit; Dew-woven nets that virgin hearts enthrall; Darts of glad thought through infant brains that flit; Hope and pursuit; loved bonds, and fancies free;— Poor were our earth of these bereft and thee! XV. Painter, in endless fame most sure to live If thou my Celia's face reveal to men, Thy heart, all other schools forsaking, give To him whom Parma boasts her citizen. All gladdening forms, with exquisitest ken, Scan thou like him; and sift as with a sieve From each its dross:—then fix the fugitive, Painting that Joy which mocks the poet's pen. The new-born fountain, and the sea-bird's grace, Be dear to thee. Whole hours, where violets gleam, Muse thou on eyes as blue, and lids as white: Where, under chestnut boughs, the moon's pale light Glimmers o'er banks of primrose, sit and dream Of those soft lustres on her innocent face! XVI. The happiest lovers that in verse have writ, After all vows to perfect beauty paid Full oft their hymns of triumph intermit, And harp and brow with funeral chaplets shade: A Babylonian choir on earth they sit In garb of exiles: sadly they upbraid Beauty and Joy that only bloom to fade, And Love and Hope to Death and Ruin knit. What shall we say? Have poets never loved? (For small that love which fears that love can die): Have those that earthly immortality Award, the name itself a mockery proved? Or of the Spirit of Life so full are they That with Death's shadow they are pleased to play? XVII. A POET TO A PAINTER. That which my fault has made me, O paint not: Paint me as that which I desire to be: The unaccomplished good that died in thought, That Limbo of high hopes, seek out, set free, And all I might have been concede to me: The mask my errors and the world have wrought Remove: the cloud disperse: erase the blot: Bid from my brow the temporal darkness flee. In that celestial and pure fount whereof Some drops affused my childhood, bathe me wholly; And shield me from my own deserts: lest they Who now but see me by the light of love A sterner insight learn from thee one day; And love pass from them like some outworn folly. XVIII. THE FALL OF BACON. Apologist for a great man, take heed! Needs he such aid? Of errors worse is none Than fond excuses urged for deeds ill-done By men whose actions mould a nation's creed. They that in might of mind their race exceed, And walk this earth like Spirits from the sun, By them should Virtue's palms not less be won:— These if they reach not, let the victim bleed! And who shall dare lament them? All are frail, Though Nemesis the meaner culprit slights: Adversity and Justice, hail, O hail! Sacred the laurelled head your lightning smites! Him from the prosperous herd ye raise, and down On crowns of fortune drop a kinglier crown. XIX. GRACE DIEU. When Francis Beaumont wandered in old time Beside that stream which throws, as then it threw, A music sweeter than the poet's rhyme O'er the grey ruins of ‘forlorn Grace Dieu,’ How oft, while bat and owl around them flew, Mourned the great Bard that blood-stained Monarch's crime; How often yearned to hear that convent chime Which, century after century, shook the dew From Charnwood's forest branches eve and dawn! De Lisle! God's Grace it was thy heart that stirred! All praise to Him, the Angelus is heard Once more from hill and woodland, crag and lawn: And yon Cistercian abbey on the height Once more ‘with psalms resoundeth, and the chaunted rite.’ XX. TO S. C. ‘Sleep dwell within thine eyes, peace in thy breast:’ To-night the memory of thy native hills, To-night the charm of unforgotten rills, Be kind to fevered nerves and thoughts opprest! Yet, if the mourners are most surely blest; If He, who only wounds to heal us, wills That thou shouldst have thy load of twofold ills, And, shorn of strength, in vain solicit rest; Then like a cross thy patient hands put forth, And gently welcome that which God accords: And let the sharpest of terrestrial swords Transfix, unblamed, the meekest heart on earth: Nor Sleep nor Death repose so perfect gives As in entire Submission wakes and lives. XXI. FROM PETRARCH. Ah me! how beauteous were those tears of hers The gathered cloud of Passion, melting, bred When that deep grief whereon her heart had fed Rose to her eyes, those tender, starlike spheres! Wandered adown her delicate face her tears, Wandered o'er pale cheeks touched with faintest red, As some clear stream through meads with flowers o'erspread, White flowers with sanguine mingled, softly steers. Love in that rain bewitching stood embowered Like blithesome bird on which the longed-for rays Blended with drops of gentlest rain are showered, And, weeping 'mid his home in those fair eyes, Shot from the bosom of that sad, sweet haze Gleams of an ever-brightening Paradise! XXII. FROM PETRARCH. That nightingale which wails with such sweet woe Haply its young ones, haply its dear mate, Fills the dark heavens and makes the fields overflow With its wild, broken chaunt disconsolate: Beside me all night long, where'er I go, Its dirge upbraids me with my own sad fate, And chides my blindness which refused to know That Death divine things too can subjugate. Ah! easy 'tis to cheat the self-deluded! Yet who had ever dreamed those sunlike eyes Setting, should leave the world in darkness shrouded? But I my pain's high mission recognise: It means that I should weep and live, and so Learn that delight abides not here below! XXIII. FROM PETRARCH. Thou Valley filled for ever with my plaint, River with tears of mine so oft increased, Fair woodland creatures, wandering bird or beast, Or, 'twixt your green banks flickering, fishes quaint; Air by my sighs made warm, and hushed, and faint, Loved path that, shadowed now, forth issuest, Hill, happy haunt, to which, now haunt unblest, Love leads me still, and Custom's dear constraint; In you full well I trace your features old, Not in myself, who, of that life bereaven, Am made a mansion of perpetual woe: Here I beheld my love; here still behold The spot from which she passed, disrobed, to Heaven, Ah, leaving still that beauteous robe below! XXIV. IN MEMORY OF SIR WILLIAM R. HAMILTON.—1. Friend of past years, the holy and the blest, When all my day shone out, a long sunrise; When aspirations seemed but sympathies, In such familiar nearness were they dressed; When Song, with swan-like plumes and starry crest, O'er-circled earth and beat against the skies, And fearless Science raised her reverent eyes From heaven to heaven, that each its God confessed With homage ever widening! Friend beloved! From me those days are passed; yet still, O, still, This night my heart with influx strange they fill Of beaming memories from my vanished youth: On thee—the temporal veil by Death removed— Rests the great Vision of Eternal Truth! Jan. 10, 1880. XXV. AFTER READING AGAIN HIS LETTERS.—2. At times I see that ample forehead lit, Bright as the day-spring round the mounted lark; At times I see thee stand in musing fit; At times in woodlands of that twilight park, Abbotstown. Deciphering well-loved names on beechen bark: Where Rotha's moonlight ripples past thee flit, I see the kiss a grave—then by it sit— That of Wordsworth's daughter. Her grave that left the land's chief Poet dark. This day I read thy letters. Word and scene Recur with strangely mingled joy and ruth; Thy soul translucent; yet thine insight keen, Thy heart's deep yearnings and perpetual youth; Thy courtesy, thy reverence, and thy truth— All that thou wert, and all thou mightst have been! XXVI. TRUE AND FALSE LOVE OF FREEDOM. 1860. They that for freedom feel not love but lust, Irreverent, knowing not her spiritual claim, And they, the votaries blind of windy fame, And they who cry “I will because I must,” They too that launch, screened by her shield august, A bandit's shaft, revenge or greed their aim, And they that make her sacred cause their game From restlessness or spleen or sheer disgust At duteous days; all these, the brood of night, Diverse, by one black note detected stand, Their scorn of every barrier raised by Right To awe self-will. Howe'er by virtue bann'd, By reason spurned, that act the moment needs Licensed they deem; holy whate'er succeeds. XXVII. NATIONAL APOSTACY. Trampling a dark hill, a red sun athwart, I saw a host that rent their clothes and hair, [glare, And dashed their spread hands 'gainst that sunset And cried, ‘Go from us, God, since God thou art! Utterly from our coasts and towns depart, Court, camp, and senate-hall, and mountain bare; Our pomp Thou troublest, and our feast dost scare, And with Thy temples dost confuse our mart! Depart Thou from our hearing and our seeing: Depart Thou from the works and ways of men; Their laws, their thoughts, the inmost of their being: Black Nightmare, hence! that earth may breathe again.’ ‘Can God depart?’ I said. A Voice replied, Close by—‘Not so: each Sin at heart is Decide.” XXVIII. Romans, that lift to Liberty, your God, Not vows but swords, suppliants self-deified, Betwixt her altars and your rock of pride A stream there rolls fiercer than Alpine flood, A fatal stream of murdered Rossi's blood! For Liberty he lived; and when he died, Prisoner, that new Rienzi's corse beside, The king, the pontiff, and the father stood! What rite piacular from that impious deed Hath cleansed your hands? Accuse not adverse stars, If guilt unwept achieve not virtue's meed. Years heal not treason. All his sands old Time Shakes down to keep unblurred those calendars, Which blazon red their Feasts of prosperous crime. 1860. TO IRELAND. AGAINST FALSE FREEDOM. 1860. I. The Nations have their parts assigned: The deaf one watches for the blind: The blind for him that hears not hears: Harmonious as the heavenly spheres Despite their outward fret and jar Their mutual ministrations are, Some shine on history's earlier page; Some prop the world's declining age: One, one reserves her buried bloom To flower—perchance on Winter's tomb. II. Greece, weak of Will but strong in Thought, To Rome her arts and science brought: Rome, strong yet barbarous gained from her A staff, but, like Saint Christopher, Knew not for whom his strength to use, What yoke to bear, what master choose. His neck the giant bent!—thereon The Babe of Bethlehem sat! Anon That staff his prop, that sacred freight His guide, he waded through the strait, And entered at a new world's gate. III. On that new stage were played once more The parts in Greece rehearsed before: Round fame's Olympic stadium vast The new-born, emulous Nations raced; Now Spain, now France the headship won, Unrisen the Russian Macedon: But naught, O Ireland, like to thee Hath been! A Sphinx-like mystery, At the world's feast thou sat'st death-pale; And blood-stains tinged thy sable veil. IV. Apostle, first, of worlds unseen! For ages, then, deject and mean: Be sure, sad land, a concord lay Between thy darkness and thy day! Thy hand, had temporal gifts been thine, Had lost, perchance, the things divine. Truth's witness sole! The insurgent North Gave way when error's flood went forth: On the scarred coasts deformed and cleft Thou, like the Church's Rock, wert left! V. That Tudor tyranny which stood 'Mid wrecks of Faith, was quenched in blood When Charles, its child and victim, lay The Rebel-Prophet's bleeding prey. Once more the destined wheel goes round! Heads royal long are half discrowned: Ancestral rights decline and die: Thus Despotism and Anarchy Alternate each the other chase, Twin Bacchantes wreathed around one vase. VI. The future sleeps in night: but thou O Island of the branded brow, Her flatteries scorn who reared by Seine Fraternity's ensanguined reign, And for a sceptre twice abhorred Twice welcomed the Cæsarian sword! Thy past, thy hopes, are thine alone! Though crushed around thee and o'erthrown, The majesty of civil might The hierarchy of social right Firm state in thee for ever hold! Religion was their life and mould. VII. The vulgar, dog-like eye can see Only the ignobler traits in thee; Quaint follies of a fleeting time; Dark reliques of the oppressor's crime. The Seer—what sees he? What the West Hath seldom save in thee possessed; The childlike Faith, the Will like fate, And that Theistic Instinct great New worlds that summons from the abyss ‘The balance to redress of this.’ VIII. Wait thou the end; and spurn the while False Freedom's meretricious smile! Stoop not thy front to anticipate A triumph certain! Watch and wait! The schismatic, by birth akin To Socialist and Jacobin, Will claim, when shift the scales of power, His natural place. Be thine that hour With good his evil to requite; To save him in his own despite; And backward scare the brood of night! THE BATTLE OF CLONTARF; OR, THE KING'S SACRIFICE. (Ireland in the Eleventh Century.) The battle of Clontarf, fought A.D. 1014, annulled for ever the Danish power in Ireland. During two centuries and more the sons of the North had landed on the Irish coasts, sacked the monasteries, burned the cities and churches, and in many places well-nigh destroyed the Christian civilisation of earlier times, although they were never able to establish a monarchy in Ireland. The native dynasties for the most part remained; and Brian the Great, then King of all Ireland, though aged and blind, led forth the native hosts against the invaders for one supreme effort. He placed his son Murrough in command; but he offered up, notwithstanding, his life for his country, and wrought her deliverance. His sons and his grandson partook his glory and his fate. His death was a favourite theme with the chroniclers and bards of ancient Erin. I. ‘Answer, thou that from the height Look'st to left, and look'st to right, Answer thou, how goes the fight?’ II. Thus spake King Brian, by his tent Kneeling, with sceptred hands that leant Upon that altar which, where'er He marched, kept pure his path with prayer. For after all his triumphs past That made him wondrous 'mid his peers, On the blind King God's will had cast The burden of his fourscore years: And therefore when that morn, at nine, He rode along the battle's van, No sword he lifted, but the Sign Of Him Who died for man. King Brian's fleshly strength decayed, Three times in puissance waxed his spirit, And tall like oak-trees towered his merit, And like a praying host he prayed:— From nine to twelve, with crown on head, Full fifty prayers the King had said; And unto each such power was given, It shook the unopening gates of heaven. III. ‘O King, the battle goes this hour As when two seas are met in might, When billow billow doth devour, And tide with tide doth fight: ‘I watch the waves of war; but none Can see what banners rise or fall; Sea-clouds on rush, sea-crests on run, And blood is over all.’ IV. Then prayed the King once more, head-bare, And made himself a cross in prayer, With outstretched arms, and forehead prone Staid on that topmost altar-stone Gem-charged, and cleansed from mortal taint, And strong with bones of many a Saint. In youth his heart for God had yearned, And Eire: now thrice his youth returned: A child full oft, ere woke the bird, The convent's nocturns he had heard, In old Kincora, or that isle Which guards, thus late, its wasted pile, While winds of night the tall towers shook; And he would peer into that Book Which lay, lamp-lit, on eagle's wings, Wherein God's Saints in gold and blue Stood up, and Prophets stood, and Kings; And he the Martyrs knew, And maids, and confessors each one, And—tabernacled there in light— That blissful Virgin enough bright To light a burnt-out sun. The blazoned Letters well he kenned That stood like gateways keeping ward, Before the Feast-Days set, to guard Long ways of wisdom without end: He knew the music notes black-barred, And music notes, like planted spears, Whereon who bends a fixed regard The gathering anthem hears, Like wakening storms 'mid pines that lean Ere sunrise o'er some dusk ravine.— The thoughts that nursed his youth, that hour Were with his age, and armed with power. V. So fifty Psalms he sang, and then Rolled round his sightless eyes again, And spake; ‘Thou watcher on the height, Make answer quick, how goes the fight?’ VI. ‘O King, the battle goes as when The mill-wheel circles round and round: The battle reels; and bones of men Beneath its wheel are ground: ‘The war-field lies like Tomar's wood By axes marred, or charred with fire, When, black o'er wood-ways ruin-strewed, Rises the last oak spire.’ VII. Then to his altar by the tent Once more King Brian turned, and bent Unsceptred hands and head discrowned Down from that altar to the ground, In such sort that the cold March air With fir-cones swept his snow-white hair; And prayed, ‘O Thou that from the skies Dost see what is, and what must be, Make mine and me Thy Sacrifice, But set this People free!’ VIII. That hour, he knew, in many a fane Late ravaged by the Pagan Dane, God's priests were offering, far and wide, The Mass of the Presanctified: For lo! it was Good Friday morn, And Christ once more was crowned with thorn: God's Church, he knew, from niche and shrine Had swept those gauds that time consumes, Whate'er sea-cave, or wood, or mine Yield from their sunless wombs: Veiled were the sacred images, He knew, like vapour-shrouded trees, Vanished gold lamp, and chalice rare; The astonished altars stripped and bare, Because upon the cross, stone-dead, Christ lay that hour disraimented. IX. He prayed—then spake—‘How goes the fight?’ Then answer reached him from the height: X. ‘O King, the battle goes as though God weighed two nations in His scale; And now the fates of Eire sink low, Now theirs that wear the mail: ‘O King, thy sons, through God's decree, Are dead save one, the best of all, Murrough—and now, ah woe is me! I see his standard fall!’ XI. It fell: but as it fell, above Through lightning-lighted skies on drove A thousand heavenly standards, dyed In martyrdom's ensanguined tide; And every tower, and town, and fane That blazed of old round Erin's shore, Down crashed, it seemed, in heaven again; So dire that thunder's roar! The wrath had come: the Danes gave way; For Brian's prayer had power that day; Seaward they rushed, the race abhorred; The sword of prayer had quelled their sword. So fled they to the ship-thronged coast; But, random-borne through Tolga's glade, A remnant from that routed host Rushed by where Brian prayed; And, swinging forth his brand, down leap'd Black Brodar, he that foremost rode, And from the kingly shoulders swept The old head, praising God; And cried aloud, ‘Let all men tell That Brodar, he that leagues with Hell, That Brodar of the magic mail Slew Brian of the Gael.’ XII. Him God destroyed! The Accursed One lay Like beast, unburied where he fell: But Brian and his sons this day In Armagh Church sleep well. And Brian's grandson strong and fair, Clutching a Sea-King by the hair, Went with him far through Tolga's wave; Went with him to the same sea-grave. So Eire gave thanks to God, though sad, And took the blessing and the bale, And sang, in funeral garments clad, The vengeance of the Gael. Silent all night the Northmen haled Their dead adown the bleeding wharf: Far north at dawn the Pirates sailed; But on thy shore, Clontarf, Old Eire once more, with wan cheeks wet, Gave thanks that He who shakes the skies Had burst His people's bond, and yet Decreed that Sacrifice: For God is One that gives and takes; That lifts the low, and fells the proud; That loves His land of Eire, and makes His rainbow in His cloud. Thus sang to Eire her Bard of old; Thus sang to trampled kerne and serf, While, sunset-like, her age of gold Came back to green Clontarf. THE BARD ETHELL. (Ireland in the Thirteenth Century.) I. I am Ethell, the son of Conn; Here I bide at the foot of the hill; I am clansman to Brian and servant to none; Whom I hated I hate: whom I loved love still. Blind am I. On milk I live, And meat, God sends it, on each Saint's Day, Though Donald Mac Art—may he never thrive— Last Shrovetide drove half my kine away! II. At the brown hill's base, by the pale blue lake, I dwell, and see the things I saw; The heron flap heavily up from the brake, The crow fly homeward with twig or straw, The wild duck, a silver line in wake, Cutting the calm mere to far Bunaw. And the things that I heard though deaf I hear; From the tower in the island the feastful cheer; The horn from the wood; the plunge of the stag, With the loud hounds after him, down from the crag. Sweet is the chase, but the battle is sweeter; More healthful, more joyous, for true men meeter! III. My hand is weak! it once was strong: My heart burns still with its ancient fire: If any man smites me he does me wrong, For I was the Bard of Brian Mac Guire. If any man slay me—not unaware, By no chance blow, nor in wine and revel, I have stored beforehand a curse in my prayer For his kith and kindred: his deed is evil. IV. There never was King, and there never will be, In battle or banquet like Malachi! The Seers his reign had predicted long; He honoured the Bards, and gave gold for song. If rebels arose he put out their eyes; If robbers plundered or burned the fanes He hung them in chaplets, like rosaries, That others, beholding, might take more pains: There was none to women more reverent-minded, (For he held his mother, and Mary, dear); If any man wronged them that man he blinded Or straight amerced him of hand or ear. There was none who founded more convents—none In his palace the old and poor were fed; The orphan walked, and the widow's son, Without groom or page to his throne or bed. In council he mused, with great brows divine, And eyes like the eyes of the musing kine, Upholding a Sceptre o'er which, men said, Seven Spirits of Wisdom like fire-tongues played. He drained ten lakes and he built ten bridges; He bought a gold book for a thousand cows; He slew ten Princes who brake their pledges; With the bribed and the base he scorned to carouse. He was sweet and awful; through all his reign God gave great harvests to vale and plain; From his nurse's milk he was kind and brave: And when he went down to his well-wept grave Through the triumph of penance his soul uprose To God and the Saints. Not so his foes! V. The King that came after! ah woe, woe, woe! He doubted his friend and he trusted his foe. He bought and he sold: his kingdom old He pledged and pawned to avenge a spite: No Bard or prophet his birth foretold: He was guarded and warded both day and night: He counselled with fools and had boors at his feast; He was cruel to Christian and kind to beast: Men smiled when they talked of him far o'er the wave: Paid were the mourners that wept at his grave! God plagued for his sake his people sore:— They sinned; for the people should watch and pray That their prayers, like angels at window and door, May keep from the King the bad thought away! VI. The sun has risen: on lip and brow He greets me—I feel it—with golden wand: Ah, bright-faced Norna! I see thee now; Where first I saw thee I see thee stand! From the trellis the girl looked down on me: Her maidens stood near: it was late in spring: The grey priests laughed as she cried in glee, ‘Good Bard, a song in my honour sing!’ I sang her praise in a loud-voiced hymn To God who had fashioned her, face and limb, For the praise of the clan and the land's behoof: So she flung me a flower from the trellis roof. Ere long I saw her the hill descending— O'er the lake the May morning rose moist and slow: She prayed me, her smile with the sweet voice blending, To teach her all that a woman should know. Panting she stood: she was out of breath: The wave of her little breast was shaking: From eyes still childish and dark as death Came womanhood's dawn through a dew-cloud breaking. Norna was never long time the same: By a spirit so strong was her slight form moulded The curves swelled out from the flower-like frame In joy; in grief to a bud she folded: As she listened her eyes grew bright and large Like springs rain-fed that dilate their marge. VII. So I taught her the hymn of Patrick the Apostle, And the marvels of Bridget and Columkille: Ere long she sang like the lark or the throstle, Sang the deeds of the servants of God's high Will: I told her of Brendan who found afar Another world 'neath the western star; Of our three great bishops in Lindisfarne isle; Of St. Fursey the wondrous, Fiacre without guile; Of Sedulius, hymn-maker when hymns were rare; Of Scotus the subtle who clove a hair Into sixty parts, and had marge to spare. To her brother I spake of Oisin and Fionn, And they wept at the death of great Oisin's son. Ossian's son, Oscar. I taught the heart of the boy to revel In tales of old greatness that never tire, And the virgin's, up-springing from earth's low level, To wed with heaven like the altar fire. I taught her all that a woman should know: And that none might teach her worse lore I gave her A dagger keen, and I taught her the blow That subdues the knave to discreet behaviour. A sand-stone there on my knee she set, And sharpen'd its point—I can see her yet— I held back her hair and she sharpened the edge While the wind piped low through the reeds and sedge. VIII. She died in the convent on Ina's height:— I saw her the day that she took the veil: As slender she stood as the Paschal light, As tall and slender and bright and pale! I saw her; and dropped as dead: bereaven Is earth when her holy ones leave her for heaven: Her brother fell in the fight at Beigh: May they plead for me, both, on my dying day! IX. All praise to the man who brought us the Faith! 'Tis a staff by day and our pillow in death! All praise, I say, to that blessed youth Who heard in a dream from Tyrawley's strand That wail, ‘Put forth o'er the sea thy hand; In the dark we die: give us hope and Truth!’ But Patrick built not on Iorras' shore That convent where now the Franciscans dwell: Columba was mighty in prayer and war; But the young monk preaches as loud as his bell That love must rule all and all wrongs be forgiven, Or else, he is sure, we shall reach not heaven! This doctrine I count right cruel and hard: And when I am laid in the old churchyard The habit of Francis I will not wear; Nor wear I his cord, or his cloth of hair In secret. Men dwindle: till psalm and prayer Had soften'd the land no Dane dwelt there! X. I forgive old Cathbar who sank my boat: Must I pardon Feargal who slew my son; Or the pirate, Strongbow, who burn'd Granote, They tell me, and in it nine priests, a nun, And—worst—Saint Finian's old crosier staff? At forgiveness like that I spit and laugh! My chief, in his wine-cups, forgave twelve men; And of these a dozen rebelled again! There never was chief more brave than he! The night he was born Loch Gur up-burst: He was bard-loving, gift-making, loud of glee, The last to fly, to advance the first. He was like the top spray upon Uladh's oak, He was like the tap-root of Argial's pine: He was secret and sudden: as lightning his stroke: There was none that could fathom his hid design! He slept not: if any man scorned his alliance He struck the first blow for a frank defiance With that look in his face, half night half light, Like the lake gust-blackened yet ridged with white! There were comely wonders before he died: The eagle barked, and the Banshee cried; The witch-elm wept with a blighted bud: The spray of the torrent was red with blood: The chief, returned from the mountain's bound, Forgat to ask after Bran, his hound. We knew he would die: three days were o'er;— He died. We waked him for three days more. One by one, upon brow and breast The whole clan kiss'd him. In peace may he rest! XI. I sang his dirge. I could sing that time Four thousand staves of ancestral rhyme: To-day I can scarcely sing the half: Of old I was corn and now I am chaff! My song to-day is a breeze that shakes Feebly the down on the cygnet's breast: 'Twas then a billow the beach that rakes, Or a storm that buffets the mountain's crest. Whatever I bit with a venomed song Grew sick, were it beast, or tree, or man: The wronged one sued me to right his wrong With the flail of the Satire and fierce Ode's fan. I sang to the chieftains: each stock I traced Lest lines should grow tangled through fraud or haste. To princes I sang in a loftier tone, Of Moran the Just who refused a throne; Of Moran whose torque would close, and choke The wry-necked witness that falsely spoke. I taught them how to win love and hate, Not love from all; and to shun debate. To maids in the bower I sang of love: And of war at the feastings in bawn or grove. XII. Great is our Order; but greater far Were its pomp and power in the days of old, When the five Chief Bards in peace or war Had thirty bards each in his train enrolled; When Ollave Fodhla in Tara's hall Fed bards and kings: when the boy, king Nial, Was trained by Torna: when Britain and Gaul Sent crowns of laurel to Dallan Forgial. To-day we can launch the clans into fight: That day we could freeze them in mid career! Whatever man knows, was our realm by right: The lore without music no Gael would hear. Old Cormac, the brave blind king, was bard Ere fame rose yet of O'Daly and Ward. The son of Milesius was bard—‘Go back, My People,’ he sang; ‘ye have done a wrong! Nine waves go back o'er the green sea track; Let your foes their castles and coasts make strong. To the island ye came by stealth and at night: She is ours if we win her in all men's sight! For that first song's sake let our bards hold fast To Truth and Justice from first to last! 'Tis over! some think we erred through pride, Though Columba the vengeance turned aside. Too strong we were not: too rich we were: Give wealth to knaves:—'tis the true man's snare! XIII. But now men lie: they are just no more: They forsake the old ways: they quest for new: They pry and they snuff after strange false lore As dogs hunt vermin! It never was true:— I have scorned it for twenty years—this babble! That eastward and southward a Saxon rabble Have won great battles, and rule large lands, And plight with daughters of ours their hands! We know the bold Norman o'erset their throne Long since! Our lands! Let them guard their own! XIV. How long He leaves me—the great God—here! Have I sinned some sin, or has God forgotten? This year I think is my hundredth year: I am like a bad apple, unripe yet rotten! They shall lift me ere long, they shall lay me—the clan— By the strength of men on mount Cruachan! God has much to think of! How much He hath seen And how much is gone by that once hath been! On sandy hills where the rabbits burrow Are Raths of Kings men name not now: On mountain tops I have tracked the furrow And found in forests the buried plough. For one now living the strong land then Gave kindly food and raiment to ten. No doubt they waxed proud and their God defied; So their harvest He blighted or burned their hoard: Or He sent them plague, or He sent the sword: Or He sent them lightning; and so they died Like Dathi, the king, on the dark Alp's side. XV. Ah me that man who is made of dust Should have pride toward God! 'Tis a demon's spleen! I have often feared lest God, the All-just, Should bend from heaven and sweep earth clean, Should sweep us all into corners and holes, Like dust of the house-floor, both bodies and souls! I have often fear'd He would send some wind In wrath; and the nation wake up stone-blind. In age or in youth we have all wrought ill: I say not our great king Nial did well, Although he was Lord of the Pledges Nine, When, besides subduing this land of Eire, He raised in Armorica banner and sign, And wasted the British coast with fire. Perhaps in his mercy the Lord will say, ‘These men! God's help! 'Twas a rough boy play!’ He is certain—that young Franciscan Priest— God sees great sin where men see least: Yet this were to give unto God the eye, Unmeet the thought, of the humming fly! I trust there are small things He scorns to see In the lowly who cry to Him piteously. Our hope is Christ. I have wept full oft He came not to Eire in Oisin's time; Though love, and those new monks, would make men soft If they were not hardened by war and rhyme. I have done my part: my end draws nigh: I shall leave old Eire with a smile and sigh: She will miss not me as I missed my son: Yet for her, and her praise, were my best deeds done. Man's deeds! man's deeds! they are shades that fleet, Or ripples like those that break at my feet: The deeds of my chief and the deeds of my King Grow hazy, far seen, like the hills in spring. Nothing is great save the death on the Cross! But Pilate and Herod I hate, and know Had Fionn lived then he had laid them low Though the world thereby had sustained great loss. My blindness and deafness and aching back With meekness I bear for that suffering's sake; And the Lent-fast for Mary's sake I love, And the honour of Him, the Man above! My songs are all over now:—so best! They are laid in the heavenly Singer's breast Who never sings but a star is born: May we hear His song in the endless morn! I give glory to God for our battles won By wood or river, on bay or creek; For Norna—who died; for my father, Conn: For feasts, and the chase on the mountains bleak: I bewail my sins, both unknown and known, And of those I have injured forgiveness seek. The men that were wicked to me and mine, (Not quenching a wrong, nor in war nor wine) I forgive and absolve them all, save three:— May Christ in His mercy be kind to me! THE SISTERS; OR, WEAL IN WOE. (Ireland in the Nineteenth Century.) Dedicated to my friend and kinsman, Stephen E. Spring Rice, June 2, 1861. [This tale, written in happier times, was intended to illustrate that nobler side of Irish life and character which is too often ignored, and which remains the hope of Ireland's true friends in her darkest days.] January, 1884. From nine to twelve my guest was eloquent In anger, mixed with sorrow, at the things He saw around us; lands half marsh, half weeds, Gates from the gate-posts miserably divorced, Hovels ill-thatched, wild fences, fissured roads— ‘Your people never for the future plan; They live but for the moment.’ Thus he spake, A youth just entering on his broad domains, A senator in prorogation time Travelling for knowledge, Oxford's accurate scholar, A perfect rider, clean in all his ways, But by traditions narrowed. As the moon Turns but one side to earth, so showed that world Whereon he gazed, for stubborn was his will, And Ireland he had never loved. ‘You err,’ I answered, taking in good part his wrath, ‘Our peasant too has prescience; far he sees; Earth is his foreground only, rough or smooth; In him from seriousness the lightness comes: Too serious is he to make sacrifice For fleeting good; the battles of this world He with the left hand fights, and half in sport; He has his moment—and eternity.’ ‘Ay, ay,’ exclaimed my guest, ‘your Church, she does it! Your feasts and fasts and wakes and social rites, With “Sir,” and “Ma'am,” and usages of Court:— I've seen a hundred men leave plough and spade To take a three weeks' infant to its grave, A cripple pay two shillings for a cart To bear him to the Holy Well. Sick Land! Look up! the proof is round you written large! Your Faith is in the balance wanting found: Your shipless seas confess it; bridgeless streams; Your wasted wealth of ore, and moor, and bay! Beneath the Upas shade of Faith depraved All things lie dead — wealth, comfort, freedom, power— All that great Nations boast!’ ‘Such things,’ I answered, ‘The Gentiles seek; and you new tests have found; “Ecclesiæ stantis vel cadentis,” friend;— “Blessed the rich: blessed whom all men praise:” New Scriptures, these; the Irish keep the old! Say, are there not diversities of gifts? Are there not virtues—Industry is one— Which reap on earth, whilst others sow for heaven? Faith, hope, and love, and purity, and patience, Humility, and self-forgetfulness, These too are virtues; yet they rear not States. What then? Of many Nations earth is made: Each hath its function; each its part for others: If all were hand, where then were ear or eye? If all were foot, where head? You rail, my friend, Not at my country only but your own. The land that gave us birth our service claims, The suffering land our love. Yet England, too, They love, and they the most, who flatter not. A thousand years of nobleness she lived Whereof you rob her! In this isle are men By ancient lineage hers. Such men might say, “My England was entombed ere yours had birth.” Dates she from Arkwright only? Rose the Nation With Alfred, or those Tudor Kings who built The Golden Gate of England's modern time, But built it upon liberties annulled, Old glories quenched, the old nobles dead or quelled— Ay, wrecks more sad?’ His host, I could not use Words rough as his albeit to shield a land For every shaft a targe; so changed the theme To her he knew—thence loved. He loved his country; An older man than he for things less great Had loved that land. Yet who could gaze, unmoved, From Windsor's terraced heights o'er those broad meads Lit by the pomp of silver-winding Thames Dropping past templed grove, and hall, and farm, Toward the great City? Who, unthrilled, could mark Her Minsters, towering far away, with heads That stay the sunset of old times; or them, Oxford and Cambridge, England's anchors twain, That to her moorings hold her? Fresh from these Who, who could tread, O Wye, thy watery vale Where Tintern reigns in ruin; who could rest Where Bolton finds in Wharf a warbling choir, Or where the sea-wind fans thy brow discrown'd, Furness, nor love and wonder? Who untouch'd, When evening creeps from Scawfell toward Black Combe, Could wander by thy darkly gleaming lakes Embayed 'mid sylvan garniture and isles From saint or anchoret named, within the embrace Of rural mountains green, or sound, scent, touch, Of kine-besprinkled, soft, partitioned vales, Almost domestic? Shadow-haunted land! By Southey's lake Saint Herbert holds his own! The knightly armour now by Yew-dale's crag Rings loud no longer: Grasmere's reddening glass Reflects no more the on-rushing clan: yet still Thy Saxon Kings, and ever-virgin Queens Possess thee with a quiet pathos; still, Like tarnished path forlorn of moon that sets Over wide-watered moor and marsh, thy Past A spiritual sceptre, though deposed, extends From sea to sea—from century-worn St. Bees To Cuthbert's tomb under those eastern towers On Durham's bowery steep! He loved his country: That love I honoured. Great and strong he called her: But well I knew that had her greatness waned, His loved had waxed. As thus we talk'd the sun Launched through the hurrying clouds a rainy beam That smote the hills. My guest exclaimed, ‘Come forth: We waste the day! Yon ridge my fancy takes; Climb we its crest!’ The wolf-hound at our feet, Our drift divining, bounded sudden on us In rapture of prospective gratitude. We passed the offending gate; a plank for bridge, We passed the offending stream which dashed its spray Contemptuous on us, proud of liberty. I laughed; ‘Our passionate Ireland is the stream; Seven hundred years at will it mocks or chides; You have not made it turn your English mill!’ We scaled the hills; we pushed through miles of trees Which, sire and son, had held their own since first The tall elk trod their ways. Lightning and storm Had left large wrecks: election wars, not less, Or hospitalities as fierce, when home A thousand chiefless clansmen dragged the bride, Or danced around a cradle,—ah, brave hearts! Loyal where cause for loyalty was scant! Vast were those woods and fair; rock, oak, and yew, Grey, green, and black, in varying measures striking That three-stringed lyre which charms not ear but eye. Long climbing, from the woodland we emerged And paced a rocky neck of pale green pasture, The limit of two counties. Full in face Rushed, ocean-scented, the harmonic wind: Round us the sheep-bells chimed; a shower late past With jewelry had hung the blackberry bush, And gorse-brake half in gold. On either side Thin-skinned, ascetic, slippery, the descent Down slanted toward the creeping mists. Our goal We reached at last—a broad and rocky mass Forth leaning, lordly, unto lands remote, The lion's head of all those feebler hills That cowering slunk behind it. Far around Low down, subjected, stretched the sea-like waste Shade-swept, unbounded, like infinity. An hour before his time the sun had dropped Behind a mountain-wall of barrier cloud Wide as the world: but five great beams converged Toward the invisible seat of his eclipse; And over many a river, bay, and mere Lay the dull red of ante-dated eve. That summit was a churchyard. Cross-engraven Thronged the close tomb-stones. Each one prayed for peace; And some were raised by men whose heads were white Ere selfless toil had won the hoarded coins That honoured thus a parent. In the midst A tomb-like chapel, thirty feet by ten, Stood monumental, with stone roof and walls The wrestling centuries slid from. Nigh we sat While, by the polished angle split, the wind Hissed like a forkèd serpent. Silent long My friend remain'd; his sallies all had ceased, A man of tender nerve though stubborn thought. The scene weighed on him like a Prophet's scroll Troubling some unjust City. Far and near He scanned the desolate region, and at last Prayed me the hieroglyphic to expound. ‘Yon tower which blurs the lonely lake far off, What is it?’ And I answered, ‘Know you not? He built it, he that Norman horsed and mailed, Who, strong in Henry's might and Adrian's bull, Rent from the Gaelic monarch half his realm;— The rest came later, dowry of the bride.’ Once more he mused; then, westward pointing, spake: ‘Yon lovely hills, yet low, with Phidian line, That melt into the horizon:—on their curve A ruined castle stands; the sky glares through it, Red, like a conflagration?’ I replied: ‘Four hundred years the Norman held his own: He spake the people's language; they in turn His war-cry had resounded far and wide; Their history he had grown, impersonate. The land rejoiced in him, and of his greatness Uplifted, glorying, on a neck high held The beautiful burden, as the wild stag lifts O'er rocky Torc his antlers! Would you more? The Desmond was unloved beside the Thames; The right of the great Palatine was trampled; His Faith by law proscribed. O'er tombs defaced, In old Askeaton's Abbey, of his sires He vowed unwilling war. Long years the realm Reel'd like a drunken man. Behold the end! Yon wreck speaks all!’ Thus question after question Dragged, maimed and mangled, dragged reluctant forth Time's dread confession! Crime replied to crime: Whom Tudor planted Cromwell rooted out; For Charles they fought;—to fight for Kings, their spoilers, The rebel named rebellion! William next! Once more the Nobles were down hurled; once more Nobility as in commission placed By God among the lowly. Loyalty To native Princes, or to Norman chiefs Their lawless conquerors, or to British Kings, Or her the Mother Church that ne'er betrayed, Had met the same reward. The legend spake Words few but plain, grim rubric traced in blood; While, like a Fury fleeting through the air, History from all the octaves of her lyre Struck but one note! What rifted tower and keep Witnessed of tyrannous and relentless wars, That shipless gulfs, that bridgeless streams and moors, Black as if lightning-scarred, or curst of God, Proclaimed of laws blacker than brand or blight— Those Penal Laws. The tale was none of mine; Stone railed at stone; grey ruins dumbly frowned Defiance, and the ruin-handled blast Scattered the fragments of Cassandra's curse From the far mountains to the tombs close by, Which muttered treason. That sad scene to me Had lost by use its pathos as the scent Which thrills us while we pass the garden palls On one within it tarrying. To my friend It spake its natural language: and as he Who, hard through habit, reads with voice unmoved A ballad that once touched him, if perchance Some listener weeps, partakes that listener's trouble Even so the stranger's sorrow struck on mine, And I believed the things which I beheld, There sitting silent. When at last he spake The spirit of the man in part was changed; The things but heard of he had seen: the truths Coldly conceded now he realized: Justice at last with terrible recoil Leap'd up full-armed, a strong man after sleep, And dashed itself against the wrong! I answered: ‘Once more you speak the words you spake this morn, “Look up, the proof is round you, written large:” But in an altered sense.’ I spake, and left him: Left him to seek a tomb which three long years Holds one I honoured. Half an hour went by; Then he rejoined me. With a knitted brow, And clear vindictiveness of speech, like him Who, loving, hates the sin of whom he loves, He spake against the men who, having won By right or wrong the mastery of this isle (For in our annals he was versed, nor ran In custom's blinkers save on modern roads), Could make of it, seven hundred years gone by, No more than this! Then I: ‘No country loved they: Her least, the imperial realm! 'Tis late to mourn; Let past be past.’ ‘The Past,’ he said, ‘is present; And o'er the Future stretches far a hand Shadowy and minatory.’ ‘Come what may,’ I said, ‘no suffering can to us be new; No shadow fail to dew some soul with grace. The history of a Soul holds in it more Than doth a Nation's! In its every chance Eternity lies hid; from every step Branch forth two paths piercing infinity. These things look noblest from their spiritual side: A statesman, on the secular side you see them, And doubt a future based on such a past. 'Tis true, with wrong dies not the effect of wrong, Or sense thereof: 'tis true stern Power with time Changes its modes, not instinct: true it is That hollow peace is war that wears a mask: Yet let us quell to-day unquiet thoughts: She rests who lies in yonder tomb: sore pains She suffered: yet within her there was peace: In God's high Will she rests, and why not we?’ Thus we conversed till twilight, thickening, crept Compassionate, o'er a scene to which we said Twilight seemed native, day a garish vest Worn by a slave. Returning, oft my friend Cast loose in wrath the arch-rebel Truth; I answered: ‘She rests, and why not we? O suffering land! Thee, too, God shields; and only for this cause Can they that love thee sleep.’— Holy were all as she, the wrongs long past Would rack our age no longer: for that cause The blinder they who mock her country's Faith. Thousands are like her! Ireland's undergrowths— Her hope is there, and not in cloud or sunshine That beat her mountain-tops. The maiden's tale He sought with instance. 'Twas not marvellous, I told him: yet to calm his thoughts perturbed, Thus, while the broad moon o'er the lonely moor Rose, blanching as she soared, till pools, at first With trembling light o'erlaid, gave back her face, And all the woodland waves as eve advanced Shone bright o'er sombre hollows, I recounted The fragments of a noteless Irish life, Not strange esteemed among us. Such a theme I sought not. Ill it were to forge for friend A providence, or snare him though to Truth. Yet I was pleased he sought that tale. 'Twas sad But in its dusky glass—and this I hid not— Shadowed a phantom image of my country, Vanquished yet victor, in her weal and woe. The father in the prime of manhood died; The mother followed soon; their children twain, Margaret Mac Carthy, and her sister Mary, The eldest scarcely ten years old, survived To spread cold hands upon a close-sealed grave, And cry to those who answered not. The man Who, in that narrow spot to them the world, Stood up and seemed as God; that gentler one Who overhung like Heaven their earliest thought, And in the bosom of whose sleepless love Reborn they seemed each morning, both were dead. In grief's bewilderment the orphans stood Like one by fraud betrayed: nor moon, nor sun, Nor trees, nor grass, nor herds, nor hills appeared To them what they had been. In saddened eyes, Frightened yet dull, in voice subdued, and feet That moved as though they feared to wake the dead, Men saw that nowhere loneliness more lives Than in the breasts of children. Time went by; The farm was lost; and to her own small home Their father's mother led them. 'Twas not far; They could behold the orchard they had loved; Behind the hedge could hear the robin sing, And the bees murmur. Slowly, as the trance Of grief dissolved, the present lived once more; The past became a dream! I see them still! Softly the beauty-making years on went, And each one as he passed our planet's verge Looked back, and left a gift. A darker shade Dropped on the deepening hair; a brighter gleam Forth flashed from sea-blue eyes with darkness fringed. Like, each to each, their stature growing kept Unchanged gradation. To her grandmother A quick eye and a serviceable hand Endeared the elder most; she kept the house; Hers was the rosier cheek, the livelier mind, The smile of readier cheer. In Mary lived A visionary and pathetic grace Through all her form diffused, from those small feet Up to that beauteous-shaped and netted head, Which from the slender shoulders and slight bust Rose like a queen's. Alone, not solitary, Full often half an autumn day she sat On the high grass-banks, foot with foot enclasped, Now twisting osiers, watching cloud-shades now, Or rushing vapours through whose chasms there shone Far off an alien race of clouds like Alps O'er Courmayeur white-gleaming, and like them To stillness frozen. Well that orphan knew them, Those marvellous clouds that roof our Irish wastes; Spring's lightsome veil outblown, sad Autumn's bier, And Winter's pillar of electric light Slanted from heaven. A spirit-world, so seemed it, In them was imaged forth to her. With us The childish heart betroths itself full oft In vehement friendship. Mary's was of these; And thus her fancy found that counterweight Which kept her feet on earth. With her there walked Two years a little maiden of the place, Her comrade, as men called her. Eve by eve Homeward from school we saw them as they passed, One arm of each about the other's neck, Above both heads a single cloak. She died, To Mary leaving what she valued most, A rosary strung with beads from Olivet. Daily did Mary count those beads; from each The picture of some Christian Truth ascending, Till all the radiant Mysteries shone on high Like constellations, and man's gloomy life For her to music rolled on poles of love Through realms of glory. Hope makes Love immortal! That friend she ne'er forgot. In later years Working with other maidens equal-aged, (A lady of the land instructed them,) In circle on the grass, not them she saw, Heard not the song they sang: alone she sat, And heard 'mid sighing pines and murmuring streams The voice of the departed. Smoothly flowed Till Margaret had attained her eighteenth year The tenor of their lives; and they became, Those sisters twain, a name in all the vale For beauty, kindness, truth, for modest grace, And all that makes that fairest flower of all Earth bears, heaven fosters—peasant nobleness:— For industry the elder. Mary failed In this, a dreamer; indolence her fault, And self-indulgence, not that coarser sort Which seeks delight, but that which shuns annoy. And yet she did her best. The dull red morn Shone, beamless, through the wintry hedge while passed That pair with panniers, or, on whitest brows The balanced milk-pails. Margaret ruled serene A wire-fenced empire smiling through soft glooms, The pure, health-breathing dairy. Softer hand Than Mary's ne'er let loose the wool; no eye Finer pursued the on-flowing line: her wheel Murmured complacent joy like kitten pleased: With us such days abide not. Sudden fell Famine, the Terror never absent long, Upon our land. It shrank—the daily dole; The oatmeal trickled from a tighter grasp; Hunger grew wild through panic; infant cries Maddened at times the gentle into wrong: Death's gentleness more oft for death made way; And like a lamb that openeth not its mouth The sacrificial People, fillet-bound, Stood up to die. Amid inviolate herds Not few the sacraments of death received, Then waited God's decree. These things are known: Strangers have witness'd to them; strangers writ The epitaph again and yet again: The nettles and the weeds by the way-side Men ate: from sharpening features and sunk eyes Hunger glared forth, a wolf more lean each hour; Children seemed pigmies shrivelled to sudden age; And the deserted babe too weak to wail But shook if hands, pitying or curious, raised The rag across him thrown. In England alms From many a private hearth were largely sent, As ofttimes they have been. 'Twas vain. The land Wept while her sons sank back into her graves Like drowners 'mid still seas. Who could escaped: And on a ghost-thronged deck, amid such cries As from the battle-field ascend at night When stumbling widows grope o'er heaps of slain, Amid such cries stood Mary, when the ship Its cable slipped and, on the populous quays Grating, without a wind, on the slow tide, Dropped downward to the main. For western shores Those emigrants were bound. At Liverpool, Fann'd by the ocean breeze the smouldering fire Of fever burst into a sudden flame; The stricken there were left; among them Mary. How long she knew not in an hospital, A Babel of confused distress, she lay, Dinned with delirious strife. But o'er her brow God shook the dew of dreams wherein she trod The shadowed wood-walks of old days once more, And dabbled in old streams. Ere long, still weak, Abroad she roamed, a basket on her arm, With violets heaped. The watchman of the city Laid his strong hand upon her drooping head Banning the impostor. 'Twas her rags, she thought, Incensed him, and in meekness moved she on. When one with lubrique smile toyed with her flowers, And spake of violet eyes and easier life, She understood not, but misliked, and passed. In Liverpool an aged priest she found, A kinsman of her mother's. Much to her Of emigrants he spake, and of their trials, Old ties annull'd, and 'mid temptations strange Lacking full oft the Bread of Life. She wept; Before the tabernacle's lamp she prayed Freshly-absolved and heavenliest, with a prayer That showered God's blessing o'er the wanderers down: But dead was her desire to cross the main. Her strength restored, beyond the city-bound With others of her nation she abode, Amid the gardens labouring. A rough clan Those outcasts seemed: not like their race at home: Nor chapel theirs, nor school. Their strength was prized; Themselves were so esteemed as that sad tribe Beside the Babylonian streams that wept, By those that loved not Sion. Weeks grew months; And, with the strength to suffer, sorrow came. Hard by their nomad camp a youth there lived Of wealthier sort, who looked upon this maid: Her country was his own: he loved it not: Had rooted quickly in the stranger's land; And versatile, cordial, specious, seeming-frank, Contracting for himself a separate peace, Had prosper'd, but had prospered in such sort As they that starve within. Her confidence He gained. To love unworthy, still he loved her: Loved with the love of an unloving heart, That love which either is in shallows lost, Or in its black depth breeds the poison weed. She knew him not; how could she? He himself Knew scantly. Near her what was best within him Her golden smile sunned forth; but, dark and cold, Like a benighted hemisphere abode A moiety of his being which she saw not. His was a superficial nature, vain, And hard, to good impressions sensitive, And most admiring virtues least his own; A mirror that took in a seeming world, And yet remained blank surface. He was crafty, Followed the plough with diplomatic heart; His acts were still like the knight's move at chess, Each a surprise; not less, to nature's self Who heard him still referr'd them. ‘What!’ men said, ‘Marry the portionless!’ Strange are fortune's freaks! The wedding-day was fixed, the ring brought home, When from a distant uncle tidings came: His latest son was dead. ‘Take thou my farm, And share my house’—So spake the stern old man— ‘And wed the wife whom I for thee have found.’ He showed the maid that letter. Slowly the weeds Made way adown the thick and stifled stream, And others followed; slowly sailed the cloud Through the dull sky, and others followed slowly: At last he spake. Low were his words and thin, Many, but scarcely heard. He asked—her counsel! Her cheek one moment burned. Death-cold, once more A little while she sat; then rose and said; ‘You would be free; I free you; go in peace.’ 'Twas the good angel in his heart that loved her; 'Twas not the man himself! He wept, but went. The woman of the house that night was sure The girl had loved him not. She thought not so When, four months past, she mark'd her mouth, aside, Tremble, his name but uttered. Sharp the wrong! Yet they on Life's bewildered book would force A partial gloss it bears not who assume The injured wholly free from blame. The world Is not a board in squares of black and white, Or else the judgment-executing tongue Would lack probation. Wronged men are not angels; Wrong's chiefest sin is this—it genders wrong; So stands the offender in his own esteem Exculpate; while the feebly-judging starve The just cause, babbling ‘mutual was the offence!’ The man was weak; not wholly vile. 'Twas well, Doubtless, to free him; yet in after years, When early blight had struck his radiant head, The girl bewailed the pride that left thus tempted The man she loved; arraigned the wrath that left him Almost without farewell. His letter too, Unopen'd she returned. 'Twas strange! so sweet— Not less there lived within her, down, far down, A fire-spring seldom wakened! When a child, At times, by some strange jealousy distrubed From her still dream she flashed in passion quelled Ere from her staider sister's large blue eyes The astonishment had passed. Such moods remained Though rare—that wrath of tender hearts, which scorns Revenge, which scarcely utters its complaint, And yet forgives but slowly. In those days Within the maiden's bosom there arose Sea-longings, and desire to sail away She knew not whither; and her arms she spread, Weeping, to winds and waves, and shores unknown, Lighted by other skies; and inly thus She reasoned self-deceived. ‘What keeps thee here? 'Twas for a farther bourne thou bad'st farewell To those at home, and here thou art as one That hangs between two callings.’ In her heart Tempests low-toned to ocean-tempests yearned, And ever when she marked the shipmast forest That on the smoky river swayed far off, Her wish became a craving. Soon once more Alone 'mid hundreds on a rain-washed deck She stood, and saw the billows heave around And all the passions of that headlong world. Dark-visaged ocean frowned with hoary brows Against dark skies; huge, lumbering water-weights Went shouldering through the abysses: streaming clouds Ran on the lower levels of the wind; And in the universe of things she seemed An atom random blown. Full many a morn Rose red through mists, like babe that weeps to rise; Full many an evening died from wave to wave; Then gradual peace possessed her. Love may wound But 'tis self-love that wound exasperates; A noble nature casts out bitterness, And o'er the scar, like pine-tree incorrupt, Weeps healing gums. Heart-whole she gazed at last, On the great city chiefest of that realm Which wears the Future's glory. Landed, soon Back to old duties with a mightier zest Her heart, its weakening sadness passed, returned Kindness made service easier, and the tasks At first distasteful smiled on her ere long. There she was loved once more; there all went well; And there in peace she might have lived and died; Yet in that region she abode not long: In part a wayward instinct drave her forth; In part a will that from the accomplished end Unstable swerved; in part a hope forlorn: She sought a site, their sojourn who had left Long since her village. There old names, old voices, Faces unknown, yet recognized, thronged round her In unconsummate union, (hearts still like, Yet all beside so different,) not like Souls Re-met in heaven—more like those Shades antique That, 'mid the empurpled fields, of other airs Mindful, in silence trod the lordly land, Or flocked around the latest guest of Death With question sad of home. Imperfect ties Rub severance into soreness. Mary passed, Thus urged, ere long to lonelier climes: she tracked Companioned sometimes, sometimes without friend, The boundless prairie, sailed the sea-like lake, Descended the broad river as it rushed Through immemorial forests: lastly stood Sole, 'mid that city by the southern sea. There sickness fell upon her: there her hand Dropt, heavier daily, on her task half done; Her feet wore chains unseen. The end, she thought, Was coming. Ofttimes, in her happier days, She wished to die and be with God: yet now, Wearied by many griefs, to life she clung, Upbraiding things foregone and inly sighing ‘None loves to die.’ Sorrow, earth-born, in some Breeds first the Earth-infection; in them works, Like those pomegranate seeds that barred from light For aye sad Ceres' child! Alas! how many, The ill-honoured ecstasies of youth surceased, Exchange its clear spring for the mire! Hope sick, How oft Faith dies! How few are they in whom Virgin but yields to Vestal; casual pureness Merged in essential; childhood's matin dew Fixed, ere exhaled, in the Soul's adamant! Mary with these had part; to her help came— That help the proud despise. One eve it chanced Upon the vast and dusking quays she stood Alone and weeping. She that morn had sent Her latest hoardings to her grandmother, And half was sorry she had naught retained: The warm rain wet her hair: she heard within The silver ringing of its drops commingling With that still mere beside her childhood's home, And with the tawny sedge that girt it round, And with its winter dogwood far away Reddening the faint, still gleam. As thus she stood Upon her shoulder sank a hand. She turned: It was a noble lady clothed in black, And veiled. That veil thrown back, she recognized At once the luminous stillness and the calm Ethereal which the sacred cloister breeds. A voice as pure and sweet as if from heaven, Toned as friend speaks to friend, addressed her thus: ‘You lack a home: our convent is hard by.’ The lady, Spanish half, and Irish half, No answer sought, but with compulsion soft Drew her, magnetic, as the tree hard by Draws the poor creeper on the ground diffused, And lifts it into light. The child's cold hand Lurked soon in hers: and in that home which seemed An isle of heaven the meek lay-sister lived, Ere long by healthier airs to strength restored, A rapturous life of Christian freedom masked In what but servitude had been to one Lacking vocation true. The Life Divine, ‘Hidden with God,’ is hidden from the world Lest Virtue should be dimmed by Virtue's praise. Heroic Virtue least by men is prized: The hero in the saint the crowd can honour, The saint at best forgive. To this world's ken Convents, of sanctity chief citadels, Though sanctity in every place is found, The snowy banners and bright oriflambs Of that resplendent realm by Counsels ruled, Not Precept only, spread in vain, despised, Or for their earthly good alone revered, Not for their claims celestial. Different far The lesson Mary learned. The poor were fed, The orphan nursed; around the sick man's couch Gentle as light hovered the healing hand; And beautiful seemed, on mountain-tops of truth, The foot that brought good tidings! Times of trial Were changed to Sabbaths; and the rude, rough girl, Waiting another service, found a home Where that which years had marred returned once more Like infant flesh clothing the leprous limb. Yet these things Mary found were blossoms only: The tree's deep root was secret. From the Vow Which bound the Will's infinitude to God, Upwelled that peaceful strength whose fount was God: From Him behind His sacramental veil In holy passion for long hours adored Came that great Love which made the bonds of earth Needless, thence irksome. Wondering, there she learned The creature was not for the creature made But for the sole Creator; that His kingdom, Glorious hereafter, lies around us here, Its visible splendour painfully suppressing, And waiting its transfigurance. Was it strange, If while those Brides of Christ around her moved Her heart sang hymns to God? Much had she suffered: Much of her suffering gladly there she learned Came of her fault; and much had kindliest ends Not yet in her fulfilled. A light o'ershone her Which slays Illusion, that white snake which slimes The labyrinth of self-love's more tender ways Virtue's most specious mimic. She was loosed: The actual by the seeming thraldom slain; Her life was from within and from above; And as, when Winter dies, and Spring new-born Her whisper breathes o'er earth, the earlier flowers, Unlike the wine-dark growths of Autumn, dipped In the year's sunset, rise in lightest hues, An astral gleam, white, green, or delicate yellow More light than colour, so the maiden's thoughts Flashed with a radiance that permitted scarce Human affections tragic. Oft, she told me, As faithless to old friends she blamed herself:— One hand touched Calvary, one the Eternal Gates; The present nothing seemed. The years passed on: The honeymoon of this heart-bridal waned; But nothing of its spousal truth was lost, Nor of its serious joy. If failures came— And much she marvelled at her slow advance, And for the first time, pierced by that stern grace Wherein no sin looks trivial, feared;—what then? Failures that deepened humbleness but sank Foundations deeper for a loftier pile Of solid virtue: transports homeward summoned For more disinterested love made way, More perfect made Obedience. If a Soul, Half-way to heaven, death past, once more to earth Were sent, it could but feel as Mary felt When on the convent grates a letter smote Loud, harsh, with summons from the outward world. Her sister, such its tidings, was a wife, (That matron whom you praised:—ay, comely is she, And good; laborious, kindly, faithful, true; Yet Time has done Time's work, her spiritual beauty Transposing gently to a lower key;) Her grandmother bereft, and weak through age, Needed her tendance sorely. Would she come? Alas! what could she? Duty stretched from far An iron hand that stayed her mounting steps; The little novices wept loud, ‘Abide!’ Long on her neck the saintly sisterhood Hung ere they blessed her: then she turned and went. And so once more she trod this rocky vale, And scarcely older looked at twenty-six Than at sixteen. Before so gentle, now A humbler gentleness was o'er her thrown; Nor ruffled was she ever as of yore With gusts of flying spleen: nor feared she now Hindrance unlovely, or the word that jarred. The sadness hers at first dispers'd ere long, And such strange sweetness came to her, men said A mad dog would not bite her. Lowliest toils Were by her hand ennobled: Labour's staff Beneath it burst in blossom. In the garden, 'Mid earliest birds, and singing like a bird, She moved, her grandmother asleep. She mixed The reverence due to years with tenderness The infant's claim. 'Twas hers to bring the crutch, Nor mark the lameness; hers with question apt To prompt, not task, the memory. Tales twice-told Wearied not her, nor orders each with each At odds, nor causeless blame. Wiles she had many To anticipate harsh moods, lest one rash word Might draw a cloud 'twixt helpless eld and heaven, Blotting the Eternal Vision felt not seen By hearts in grace. With works of gay caprice, Needless—yet prized—she made the spectre Want Seem farther off. Thus love in narrow space Built a great world. The grandmother preferred To her, that dreamful girl of old, the woman Who from the mystic precinct first had learned Humanity, yet seemed a human creature O'erruled by some angelic guest. At heart Ever a nun, she ministered with looks That healed the sick. The newly-widowed door Its gloom remitted when she passed; stern foes Downtrod their legend of old wrongs. To her Sacred were those that grieved;—those tearless yet Sacred scarce less because they smiled, nor knew The ambushed fate before them. When a child, Grey-haired companionship or solitude Had pleased her more than childish mates; but now All the long eves of summer in the porch The children of her sister and the neighbours, A spotless flock, sat round her. From her smiles The sluggish mind caught light, the timid heart Courage and strength. Unconscious thus, each day Her soft and blithesome feet one letter traced In God's great Book above. So passed her life;— Sorrow had o'er it hung a gentle cloud; But, like an autumn-mocking day in Spring, Dewy and dim yet ending in pure gold, The sweets were sweeter for the rain, the growth Stronger for shadow. You have seen her tomb! Upon the young and beautiful it closed: Her grandmother yet lingers! What is Time? Shut out the sun, and all the summer long The fruit-tree stands as barren as the rock; May's offering March can bring us. Of the twain The younger doubtless in the eyes of God Had inly lived the longest. She had learned From action much, from suffering more, far more, For stern Experience is a sword whose point Makes way for Truth. Her trials, great and little, And trials ever keep proportion just With high vocations and the spirit's growth, Had done their work till all her inner being Freed from asperities, in the light of God Shone like the feet of some old crucifix Kissed into smoothness. Here I fain would end, Leaving her harboured; but her stern, kind fates Not thus forewent her. Like her life her death, Not negative or neutral; great in pains, In consolations greater. Many a week Much ailed her; what the cause remained in doubt; When certainty had come she trembled not: Fixed was her heart. Those pangs that shook her frame, Like tempests roaring round a mountain church, Shook not that peace within her! She was thankful; ‘More pain if such Thy Will, and patience more,’ This was her prayer; or wiping from moist eyes The trembling tear, she whispered, ‘Give me, Lord, On earth Thy cleansing fire that I may see Sooner Thy Face, death past!’ Alleviations, Many and great, God granted her. Once more Her sister was her sister! Unlike fortunes Had placed at angles those two lives that once Lay side by side; and love that could not die Had seemed to sleep. It woke: and, as from mist, Once more shone out their childhood! Laughed and flashed Once more the garden-beds whose bright accost Had cheered them for their parents mourning. Tears Remembered stayed the course of later tears; The prosperous from the unprosperous sister sought Heart-peace; nor wealth nor care could part them more; And sometimes Margaret's children seemed to her As children of another! Greetings sweet Cheered her from distant regions. Once it chanced The nuns a relic sent her ne'er before Seen in our vales, a fragment of that Cross Whereon the world's Redeemer hung three hours:— The neighbours entering knelt and wept, and smote Their breasts; her hands she raised in prayer; and straight Such Love, such Reverence in her heart there rose Her anguish, like a fiend exorcised, fled; And for an hour at peace she lay as one Imparadised. A solace too was hers Known but to babes. Her body, not her mind, Was racked; the pang to come she little feared, Nor lengthened out morose the pang foregone; Once o'er, to sleep she sank in thankful prayer. A week ere Mary died all suffering left her; And from the realms of glory beams, as though Further restraint they brooked not, fell on her Yet militant below, as there she lay In monumental whiteness, spirit-lit. The anthems of her convent charmed once more Her dreams; and scents from woods where she had sat In tears. Then spake she of her wandering days;— Herself she scarcely seemed to see in them; Plainly thus much I saw: When all went well, Danger stood nigh; but soon as sorrow came Within that darkness nearer by her side Walked her good Angel. In that latest week Some treasures hidden ever near her heart She showed me: faded flowers; her mother's hair; Gold pieces that have raised our chapel's Cross; A riband by her youthful comrade worn:— Upon its cover some few words I found There traced when first beyond the western main She heard the homeless cuckoo's cry well-known: ‘When will my People to their land return?’ From the first hour her grandchild sank, once more She that for years bed-ridden lay had risen, And, autumn past, put forth a wintry strength, Ministering. Her frame was stronger than her mind; O'er that at times a dimness hung, like cloud That creeps from pine to pine. Inly she missed Her wonted place of homage lost; she mused Sadly upon the solitary future; But in her there abode a rock-like will, And from her tearless service night or day No man might push her. Seldom spake the woman: She called her grandchild by her daughter's name, Her daughter buried thirty years and more, And once she said in wrath, ‘Why toil they thus? Nora is dead.’ She laboured till the end: It came—that mortal close! 'Twas Christmas Eve; Far, far away were heard the city bells: The sufferer slept. At midnight I went forth; Along the ice-filmed road a dull gleam lay, And a sepulchral wind in woods far off Sang dirges deep. Upon her crutches bent The aged woman stood beside the door, With that long gaze intense which is an act Silently looking toward that hill of graves We trod to-day; a sinking moon shone o'er it: Then whispered she—the light of buried years Edging once more her eyes—‘Each Saturday, Of those that in that churchyard sleep three Souls, Their penance done, ascend, and are with God.’ Thus as she spake a cry was heard within, And many voices raised the Litany For a departing Soul. Long time—to long— Had seemed that dying! Now the hour was come, And change ineffable announced that Death At last was standing on the floor. O hour! When in brief space our life is lived again! Down cast the latest stake! when fiends ascend, Beckoning the phantoms of forgotten sins Conscience to scare, or launching as from slings Temptations new; while Angels hold before us The Cross unshaken as the sun in heaven, And whisper, ‘Christ.’ O hour! when prayer is all; And they that clasp the hand are thrown apart By the world's breadth from that they love! The act Sin's dread bequest that makes an end of sinning, Long lasted, while the heart-strings snapt, and all The elements of the wondrous sensuous world Slid from the fading sense, and those poor fingers, As the loose precipice of life down crumbled, Plucked as at roots. Storm-winged the hours rushed by; There lay she like some bark on midnight seas, Now toiling through the windless vale, anon Hurled on and up to meet the implacable blast Upon the rolling ridge, when not a foot Can tread the decks, and all the sobbing planks Tremble o'erspent. The morning dawned at last Whitening the frosty pane; the lights removed, (Save that tall candle in her hand sustained By others,) she descried it: ‘Ah!’ she said, ‘Thank God! another day!’ Then, nothing one Who near her knelt, she said, ‘The night is sped, And you have had no sleep; alas! I thought Ere midnight I should die.’ Her eyelids closed; Into a sleep as quiet as a babe's Gradual she sank; and while the ascending sun Shot 'gainst the western hill his earliest beam, In sleep, without a sigh, her spirit passed. I would you could have seen her face in death! I would you could have heard that last dread rite, The mighty Mother's, o'er the stormy gulf And all the moanings of the unknown abyss Flinging victorious anthems, or the strength Of piercing prayer: ‘Oh! ye at least, my friends, Have pity on me! plead for me with God!’ That Rite complete, the dark procession wound Interminably through the fields and farms, While wailing like a midnight wind, the keen Expired o'er moor and heath. At eve we reached The graveyard; slowly, as to-day, the sun Behind a tomb-like bank of leaden cloud Dropt while the coffin sank, and died away The latest Miserere— More than once I would have ceased; but he, my friend and guest, Or touched or courteous, willed me to proceed. Perhaps that tale the wild scene harmonized By sympathy occult; perhaps it touched him, Contrasting with his recent life—with England, With Oxford, long his home; its ordered pomp; Its intermingled groves, and fields, and spires, Its bridges spanning waters calm and clear; The frequentation of its courts; its chimes; Its sunset towers, and strangely youthful gardens That breathe the ardours of the budding year On the hoar breadth of grove-like cloisters old, Chapels, and libraries, and statued halls, England's still saintly City! Time has there A stone tradition built like that all round Woven by the inviolate hedges, where the bird Her nest has made and warbled to her young, May after May secure, since the third Edward Held his last tournament, and Chaucer sang To Blanche and to Philippa lays of love— Not like Iernian records. Sad we rose, That tale complete; and, after silence long, As homeward through the braided forest-skirt We trod the moonlight-spotted rocks, my friend Resumed, with pregnant matter oft more just In thought than application; but his voice Was softer than it used to be. At last, After our home attained, we turned, and lo! With festal fires the hills were lit! Thine eve, Saint John, had come once more; and for thy sake, As though but yesterday thy crown were won, Amid their ruinous realm uncomforted The Irish people triumphed. Gloomy lay The intermediate space: thence brightlier burned The circling fires beyond it. ‘Lo!’ said I, ‘Man's life as viewed by Ireland's sons; a vale With many a pitfall throng'd, and shade, and briar, Yet over-blown by angel-haunted airs, And by the Light Eternal girdled round.’ Brief supper passed, within the porch we sat As fire by fire burned low. We spake; were mute; Resumed; but our discourse was gently toned, Touched by a spirit from that wind-beaten grave, Which breathed among its pauses, as of old That converse Bede records, when by the sea, 'Twixt Tyne and Wear, facing toward Lindisfarne, Saxon Ceolfrid and his Irish guest, Evangelist from old Iona's isle, 'Mid the half Pagan land in cloisters dim Discuss'd the Tonsure, and the Paschal time, Sole themes whereon, in sacred doctrine one, They differed; but discussed them in such sort That mutual reverence deeper grew. We heard The bridgeless brook that sang far off, and sang Alone: for not among us builds that bird Which changes light to music, haply ill-pleased That Ireland bears not yet, in song's domain To Spenser worthy fruit. Our beds at last, Wearied, yet glad, we sought. Ere long the wind, Gathering its manifold voices and the might Of all its wills in valleys far, and rolled From wood to wood o'er ridge and ravine, woke Those Spectres which o'erhang my sleep in storm, A hundred hills to me by sound well known, That stand dark clustered in the night, and bend With rainy skirt o'er lake and prone morass, Or by sea-bays leaned out procumbent brows, Waiting the rising sun. At morn we met Once more, my friend and I. The evening's glow Had from his feelings passed: in their old channels They flowed, scarce tinged. But still his thoughts retained The trace of late impressions quaintly linked With kindred thought-notes earlier. Half his mind Scholastic was; his fancy deep; the age Alone had stamped him modern. Much he spake Of England wise and wealthy—now no more, He said, ‘a haughty nation proud in arms,’ Nor, as in Saxon times, a crownèd child Propped 'against the Church's knee; but ocean's Queen, Spanning the world with golden zone twin-clasped By Commerce and by Freedom! But no less Of pride and suffering spake he, and that frown Sun-pressed on brows once pure. Of Ireland next:— ‘How strange a race, more apt to fly than walk; Soaring yet slight; missing the good things round them, Yet ever out of ashes raking gems; In instincts loyal, yet respecting law Far less than usage: changeful, yet unchanged! Timid, yet enterprising: frank, yet secret: Untruthful oft in speech, yet living truth, And Truth in things divine to life preferring:— Scarce men; yet possible angels! “Isle of Saints!” Such doubtless was your land—again it might be— Strong, prosperous, manly never! ye are Greeks In intellect, and Hebrews in the soul: The solid Roman heart, the corporate strength Is England's dower!’ ‘Unequally if so,’ I said, ‘in your esteem the Isles are matched:— They live in distant ages, alien climes; Native they are to diverse elements: Our swan walks awkwardly upon dry land; Your boasted strength in spiritual needs so helps you As armour helps the knight who swims a flood.’ He laughed. ‘At least no siren streams for us, Nor holy wells! We love “the fat of the land,” Meads such as Rubens painted! Strange our fates! Our feast is still the feast of fox and stork, The platter broad, and amphora long-necked;— Ill sorted yoke-mates truly. Strength, meanwhile, Lords it o'er weakness!’ ‘Never yet,’ I answered, ‘Was husband vassal to an intricate wife But roared he ruled her;’ ere his smile had ceased, Continuing thus:—‘Ay! strength o'er weakness rules! Strength hath in this no choice. But what is Strength? Two Strengths there are. Club-lifting Hercules, A mountained mass of gnarled and knotted sinews, How shows he near the intense, Phœbean Might That, godlike, spurns the ostent of thews o'ergrown; That sees far off the victory fixed and sure, And, without effort, wings the divine death Like light, into the Python's heart? My friend, Justice is strength; union on justice built;— Good-will is strength—kind words—silence—that truth Which hurls no random charge. Your scribes long time Blow on our island like a scythèd wind: The good they see not, nor the cause of ill; They tear the bandage from the wound half-healed:— Is not such onset weakness? Were it better, Tell me, free-trader staunch, for sister Nations To make exchange for aye of scorn for scorn, Or blend the nobler powers and aims of each, Diverse, and for that cause correlative, True commerce, noblest, holiest, frankest, best, And breed at last some destiny to God Glorious, and kind to man?—If torn apart One must her empire lose, and one her all.’ Thus as we spake, the hall clock vast and old, A waif from Spain's Armada, chimed eleven: And from the stables drew a long-hair'd boy Who led a horse as shaggy as a dog, A splenetic child of thistles and hill blast, Rock-ribbed, and rich in craft of every race From weasel to the beast that feigns to die. Mounting—alas! that friends should ever part,— My guest bade thus adieu: ‘For good or ill Our lands are linked.’ And I rejoined, ‘For which? This shall you answer when, your pledge fulfilled, Before the swallow you return, and meet The unblown Spring in our barbaric vale.’ 1860.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. TO THE MEMORY OF WORDSWORTH THE LEGENDS OF SAINT PATRICK. THE BAPTISM OF ST. PATRICK. ‘How can the babe baptizéd be Where font is none, and water none?’ Thus wept the nurse on bended knee, And swayed the Infant in the sun. ‘The blind priest took that Infant's hand: With that small hand, above the ground He signed the Cross. At God's command A fountain rose with brimming bound. ‘In that pure wave, from Adam's sin The blind priest cleansed the Babe with awe; Then, reverently, he washed therein His old, unseeing face, and saw! ‘He saw the earth; he saw the skies, And that all-wondrous Child decreed A pagan nation to baptize, To give the Gentiles light indeed.’ Thus Secknall sang. Far off and nigh The clansmen shouted loud and long; While every mother tossed more high Her babe, and glorying joined the song. THE DISBELIEF OF MILCHO, OR, SAINT PATRICK'S ONE FAILURE. ARGUMENT. Fame of St. Patrick goes ever before him, and men of goodwill believe gladly; but Milcho, a mighty merchant, and one given wholly to pride and greed, wills to disbelieve. St. Patrick sends him greeting and gifts; but he, discovering that the prophet welcomed by all had once been his slave, hates him the more. Notwithstanding, he fears that when that prophet arrives, he, too, may be forced to believe, though against his will. He resolves to set fire to his castle and all his wealth, and make new fortunes in far lands. The doom of Milcho, who willed to disbelieve. When now at Imber Dea A river in Wicklow. that precious bark Freighted with Erin's future, touched the sands Just where a river, through a woody vale Curving, with duskier current clave the sea, Patrick, the Island's great inheritor, His perilous voyage past, stept forth and knelt And blessed his God. The peace of those green meads Cradled 'twixt purple hills and purple deep, Seemed as the peace of heaven. The sun had set; But still those summits twinned, the ‘Golden Spears,’ Laughed with his latest beam. The hours went by: The brethren paced the shore or musing sat, But still their Patriarch knelt and still gave thanks For all the marvellous chances of his life Since those his earlier years when, slave new-trapped, He comforted on hills of Dalaraide His hungry heart with God, and, cleansed by pain, In exile found the spirit's native land. Eve deepened into night, and still he prayed: The clear cold stars had crowned the azure vault; And, risen at midnight from dark seas, the moon Had quenched those stars, yet Patrick still prayed on: Till from the river murmuring in the vale, Far off, and from the morning airs close by That shook the alders by the river's mouth, And from his own deep heart a voice there came, ‘Ere yet thou fling'st God's bounty on this land There is a debt to cancel. Where is he, Thy five years' lord that scourged thee for his swine? Alas that wintry face! Alas that heart Joyless since earliest youth! To him reveal it! To him declare that God who Man became To raise man's fall'n estate, as though a man, All faculties of man unmerged, undimmed, Had changed to worm and died the prey of worms, That so the mole might see!’ Thus Patrick mused, Not ignorant that from low beginnings rise Oftenest the works of greatness; yet of this Unweeting, that his failure, one and sole Through all his more than mortal course, even now Before that low beginning's threshold lay, Betwixt it and that Promised Land beyond A bar of scandal stretched. Not otherwise Might whatsoe'er was mortal in his strength Dying, put on the immortal. With the morn Deep sleep descended on him. Waking soon, He rose a man of might, and in that might Laboured; and God His servant's toil revered; And gladly on that coast Erin to Christ Paid her firstfruits. Three days he preached his Lord: The fourth embarking, cape succeeding cape They passed, and heard the lowing herds remote In hollow glens, and smelt the balmy breath Of gorse on golden hillside; till at eve, The Imber Domnand The Malahide River. reached, on silver sands Grated their keel. Around them flocked at dawn Warriors with hunters mixed, and shepherd youths, And maids with lips as red as mountain berries And eyes like sloes, or keener eyes, dark-fringed And gleaming like the blue-black spear. They came With milk-pail, and with kid, and kindled fire And spread the genial board. Upon that shore Full many knelt and gave themselves to Christ, Strong men, and men at midmost of their hopes By sickness felled; old chiefs, at life's dim close That oft had asked, ‘Beyond the grave what hope?’ Worn sailors weary of the toilsome seas, And craving rest; they, too, that sex which wears The blended crowns of Chastity and Love; Wondering, they hailed the Maiden-Motherhood; And listening children praised the Babe Divine, And passed Him, each to each. Ere long, once more Their sails were spread. Again by grassy marge They rowed, and sylvan glades. The branching deer Like flying gleams went by them. Oft the cry Of fighting clans rang out: but oftener yet Clamour of rural dance, or mart confused With many-coloured garb and movements swift, Pageant sun-bright: or on the sands a throng Girdled with circle glad some bard whose song Shook the wild clan as tempest shakes the woods. Still north the wanderers sailed: at evening, mists Cumbered the shore and on them leaned the blast, And fierce rain flashed mingling with dim-lit sea. All night they toiled; next day at noon they kenned A seaward stream that shone like golden tress Severed and random-thrown. That river's mouth Ere long attained was all with lilies white As April field with daisies. Entering there They reached a wood, and disembarked with joy: There, after thanks to God, silent they sat In thought, and watched the ripples, dusk yet bright, That lived and died like things that laughed at time, On gliding 'neath those many-centuried boughs. But, midmost, Patrick slept. Then through the trees, Shy as a fawn half-tamed, now stole, now fled A boy of such bright aspect, faëry child He seemed, or babe exposed of royal race: At last assured beside the Saint he stood, And dropped on him a flower, and disappeared: Thus flower on flower from the great woods he brought And hid them in the bosom of the Saint. The monks forbade him, saying, ‘Lest thou wake The master from his sleep.’ But Patrick woke, And saw the boy, and said, ‘Forbid him not; The heir of all my kingdom is this child.’ Then spake the brethren, ‘Wilt thou walk with us?’ And he, ‘I will:’ and so for his sweet face They called his name Benignus: and the boy Thenceforth was Christ's. Beneath his parent's roof At night they housed. Nowhere that child would sleep Except at Patrick's feet. Till Patrick's death Unchanged to him he clave, and after reigned The second at Ardmacha. Now Armagh. Day by day They held their course; ere long the hills of Mourne Loomed through sea-mist: Ulidian summits next Before them rose: but nearer at their left Inland with westward channel wound the wave Changed to sea-lake. Nine miles with chant and hymn They tracked the gold path of the sinking sun; Then southward ran 'twixt headland and green isle And landed. Dewy pastures sunset-dazed, At leisure paced by mild-eyed milk-white kine Smiled them a welcome. Onward moved in sight Swiftly, with shadow far before him cast, Dichu, that region's lord, a martial man And merry, and a speaker of the truth. Pirates he deemed them first and toward them faced With wolf-hounds twain that watched their master's eye To spring, or not to spring. The imperious face Forbidding not, they sprang: but Patrick raised His hand, and stone-like crouched they chained and still: Then, Dichu onward striding fierce, the Saint Between them signed the Cross; and lo, the sword Froze in his hand, and Dichu stood like stone. The amazement past, he prayed the man of God To grace his house; and, side by side, a mile They clomb the hills. Ascending, Patrick turned, His heart with prescience filled. Beneath, there lay A gleaming strait; beyond, a dim vast plain With many an inlet pierced; a golden marge Girdled the water-tongues with flag and reed; But, farther off, a gentle sea-mist changed The fair green flats to purple. ‘Night comes on;’ Thus Dichu spake, and waited. Patrick then Advanced once more, and Sabhall soon was reached, A castle half, half barn. There garnered lay Much grain, and sun-imbrowned: and Patrick said, ‘Here where the earthly grain was stored for man The bread of angels man shall eat one day.’ And Patrick loved that place, and Patrick said, ‘King Dichu, give thou to the poor that grain, To Christ, our Lord, thy barn.’ The strong man stood In doubt; but prayers of little orphaned babes Reared by his hand, went up for him that hour: Therefore that barn he ceded, and to Christ By Patrick was baptized. Where lay the corn A convent later rose. There dwelt he oft; And 'neath its roof more late the stranger sat, Exile, or kingdom-wearied king, or bard, That haply blind in age, yet tempest-rocked By memories of departed glories, drew With gradual influx into his old heart Solace of Christian hope. With Dichu bode Patrick somewhile, intent from him to learn The inmost of that people. Oft they spake Of Milcho. ‘Once his thrall, against my will In earthly things I served him: for his soul Needs therefore must I labour. Hard was he; Unlike those hearts to which God's Truth makes way Like message from a mother in her grave: Yet what I can I must. Not heaven itself Can force belief; for Faith is still good will.’ Dichu laughed aloud: ‘Good will! Milcho's good will! Neither to others, nor himself, good will Hath Milcho! Fireless sits he, winter through, The logs beside his hearth: and as on them Glimmers the rime, so glimmers on his face The smile. Convert him! Better thrice to hang him! Baptize him! He will film your font with ice! The cold of Milcho's heart has winter-nipt That glen he dwells in! From the sea it slopes Unfinished, savage, like some nightmare dream, Raked by an endless east wind of its own. On wolf's milk was he suckled, not on woman's! To Milcho speed! Of Milcho claim belief! Milcho will shrivel his small eye and say He scorns to trust himself his father's son, Nor deems his lands his own by right of race But clutched by stress of brain! Old Milcho's God Is gold. Forbear him, sir, or ere you seek him Make smooth your way with gold.’ Thus Dichu spake; And Patrick, after musings long, replied: ‘Faith is no gift that gold begets or feeds, Oftener by gold extinguished. Unto God, Unbribed, unpurchased, yearns the soul of man; Yet finds perforce in God its great reward. Not less this Milcho deems I did him wrong, His slave, yet fleeing. To requite that loss Gifts will I send him first by messengers Ere yet I see his face.’ Then Patrick snet His messengers to Milcho, speaking thus: ‘If ill befell thy herds through flight of mine Fourfold that loss requite I, lest, for hate Of me, thou disesteem my Master's Word. Likewise I sue thy friendship; and I come In few days' space, with gift of other gold Than earth concedes, the Tidings of that God Who made all worlds, and late His Face hath shown, Sun-like to man. But thou, rejoice in hope!’ Thus Patrick, once by man advised in part, Though wont to counsel with his God alone. Meantime full many a rumour vague had vexed Milcho much musing. He had dealings large And distant. Died a chief? He sent and bought The widow's all; or sold on foodless shores For usury the leanest of his kine. Meantime, his dark ships and the populous quays With news still murmured. First from Imber Dea Came whispers how a sage had landed late, And how when Nathi fain had barred his way, Nathi that spurned Palladius from the land, That sage with levelled eyes, and kingly front Had from his presence driven him with a ban Cur-like and craven; how on bended knee Sinell believed, the royal man well-loved Descending from the judgment-seat with joy: And how when fishers spurned his brethren's quest For needful food, that sage had raised his rod, And all the silver harvest of blue streams Lay black in nets and sand. His wrinkled brow Wrinkling yet more, thus Milcho answer made: ‘Deceived are those that will to be deceived: This knave has heard of gold in river-beds, And comes a deft sand-groper; let him come! He'll toil ten years ere gold enough he finds To make a crooked torque.’ From Tara next The news: ‘Laeghaire, the King, sits close in cloud Of sullen thought, or storms from court to court, Because the chiefest of the Druid race Locru, and Luchat, prophesied long since That one day from the sea a Priest would come With Doctrine and a Rite, and dash to earth Idols, and hurl great monarchs from their thrones; And lo! At Imber Boindi late there stept A Priest from roaring waves with Creed and Rite, And men before him bow.’ Then Milcho spake: ‘Not flesh enough from thy strong bones, Laeghaire, These Druids, ravens of the woods, have plucked, But they must pluck thine eyes! Ah priestly race, I loathe ye! 'Twixt the people and their King Ever ye rub a sore!’ Last came a voice: ‘This day in Eire thy saying is fulfilled, Conn of the “Hundred Battles,” from thy throne Leaping long since, and crying, “O'er the sea The Prophet cometh, princes in his train, Bearing for regal sceptres bended staffs, Which from the land's high places, cliff and peak, Shall drag the fair flowers down!”’ Scoffing he heard: ‘Conn of the “Hundred Battles!” Had he sent His hundred thousand kernes to yonder steep And rolled its boulders down, and built a mole To fence my laden ships from spring-tide surge, Far kinglier pattern had he shown, and given More solace to the land.’ He rose and turned With sideway leer; and printing with vague step Irregular the shining sands, on strode Toward his cold home, alone; and saw by chance A little bird light-perched, that, being sick, Plucked from the fissured sea-cliff grains of sand; And, noting, said, ‘O bird, when beak of thine From base to crown hath gorged this huge sea-wall, Then shall that man of Creed and Rite make null The strong rock of my will!’ Thus Milcho spake, Feigning the peace not his. Next day it chanced Women he heard in converse. Thus the first: ‘If true the news, good speed for him, my boy! Poor slaves by Milcho scourged on earth shall wear In heaven a monarch's crown! Good speed for her His little sister, not reserved like us To bend beneath these loads.’ To whom her mate: ‘Doubt not the Prophet's tidings! Not in vain The Power Unknown hath shaped us! Come He must, Or send, and help His people on their way. Good is He, or He ne'er had made these babes!’ They passed, and Milcho said, ‘Through hate of me All men believe! ’And straightway Milcho's face Grew bleaker than that crab-tree stem forlorn That hid him, wanner than that sea-sand wet That whitened round his foot down-pressed. Time passed. One morn in bitter mockery Milcho mused: ‘What better laughter than when thief from thief Pilfers the pilfered goods? Our Druid thief Two thousand years hath milked and shorn this land; Now comes the thief outlandish that with him Would share milk-pail and fleece! O Bacrach old, To hear thee shout “Impostor!”’ Straight he went To Bacrach's cell hid in a skirt wind-shav'n Of low-grown wood, and met, departing thence, Three sailors sea-tanned from a ship late-beached. Within a corner huddled, on the floor, The Druid sat, cowering, and cold, and mazed: Sudden he rose, and cried, by conquering joy Clothed as with youth restored: ‘The God Unknown, That God who made the earth, hath walked the earth! This hour His Prophet treads the isle! Three men Have seen him; and their speech is true. To them That Prophet spake: “Four hundred years ago, Sinless God's Son on earth for sinners died: Black grew the world, and graves gave up their dead.” Thus spake the Seer. Four hundred years ago! Mark well the time! Of Ulster's Druid race What man but yearly, those four hundred years, Trembled that tale recounting which with this, Tallies as footprint with the foot of man? Four hundred years ago—that self-same day— Connor, the son of Nessa, Ulster's King, Sat throned, and judged his people. As he sat, Under clear skies, behold, o'er all the earth Swept a great shadow from the windless east; And darkness hung upon the air three hours; Dead fell the birds, and beasts astonied fled. Then to his Chief of Druids, Connor spake Whispering; and he, his oracles explored, Shivering made answer, “From a land accursed, O King, that shadow sweeps; therein, this hour, By sinful men sinless God's Son is slain.” Then Ulster's king, down-dashing sceptre and crown, Rose, clamouring, “Sinless! Shall the sinless die?” And madness fell on him; and down that steep He rushed whereon the Emanian Palace stood, And reached the grove, Lambraidhè, with two swords, The sword of battle, and the sword of state, And hewed and hewed, crying, “Were I but there Thus they should fall who slay that Sinless One;” And in that madness died. Old Erin's sons Beheld this thing; nor ever in the land Hath ceased the rumour, nor the tear for him Who, wroth at justice trampled, martyr died. And now we know that not for any dream He died, but for the truth: and whensoe'er The Prophet of that Son of God who died Sinless for sinners, standeth in this place, I, Bacrach, oldest Druid in this Isle, Will rise the first, and kiss his vesture's hem.’ He spake; and Milcho heard, and without speech Departed from that house. A later day When the wild March sunset, gone almost ere come, By glacial shower was hustled out of life, Under a blighted ash tree, near his house, Thus mused the man: ‘Believe, or Disbelieve! The will does both! Then idiot who would be For profitless belief to sell himself? Yet disbelief not less might work our bane! For, I remember, once a sickly slave Ill shepherded my flock: I spake him plain; “When next, through fault of thine, the midnight wolf Worries my sheep, on yonder tree you hang:” The blear-eyed idiot looked into my face, And smiled his disbelief. On that day week Two lambs lay dead. I hanged him on a tree. What tree? this tree! Why, this is passing strange! For, three nights since, I saw him in a dream: Weakling as wont he stood beside my bed, And, clutching at his wrenched and livid throat, Spake thus, “Belief is safest.”’ Ceased the hail To rattle on the ever barren boughs, And friendlier sound was heard. Beside his door Wayworn the messengers of Patrick stood, And showed the gifts, and held his missive forth. Then learned that lost one all the truth. That sage Confessed by miracles, that prophet vouched By warnings old, that seer by words of might Subduing all things to himself—that priest, None other was than the uncomplaining boy Five years his slave and swineherd! In him rage Burst forth, with fear commixed, as when a beast Strains in the toils. ‘Can I alone stand firm?’ He mused; and next, ‘Shall I, in mine old age, Byword become—the vassal of my slave? Shall I not rather drive him from my door With wolf hounds and a curse?’ As thus he stood He marked the gifts, and bade men bare them in, And homeward signed the messengers unfed. But Milcho slept not all that night for thought, And, forth ere sunrise issuing, paced a moor Stone-roughened like the graveyard of dead hosts, Till noontide. Sudden then he stopt, and thus Discoursed within: ‘A plot from first to last, The fraudulent bondage, flight, and late return; For now I mind me of a foolish dream Chance-sent, yet drawn by him awry. One night Methought that boy from far hills drenched in rain Dashed through my halls all fire. From hands and head, From hair and mouth, forth rushed a flaming fire White, like white light, and still that mighty flame Into itself took all. With hands outstretched I spurned it. On my cradled daughters twain It turned, and they were ashes. Then in burst The south wind through the portals of the house, Tempest rose-sweet, and blew those ashes forth Wide as the realm. At dawn I sought the knave; He glossed my vision thus: “That fire is Faith— Faith in the God Triune, the God made Man, Sole light wherein I walk, and walking burn; And they that walk with me shall burn like me By Faith. But thou that radiance wilt repel, Housed through ill-will, in Error's endless night. Not less thy little daughters shall believe With glory and great joy; and, when they die, Report of them, like ashes blown abroad, Shall light far lands, and health to men of Faith Stream from their dust.” I drave the impostor forth: Perjured ere long he fled, and now returns To reap a harvest from his master's dream'— Thus mused he, while black shadow swept the moor. So day by day darker was Milcho's heart, Till, with the endless brooding on one thought, Began a little flaw within that brain Whose strength was still his boast. Was no friend nigh? Alas! what friend had he? All men he scorned; Knew truly none. In each, the best and sweetest Near him had ever pined, like stunted growth Dwarfed by some glacier nigh. The fifth day dawned: And inly thus he muttered, darkly pale: ‘Five days; in three the messengers returned: In three—in two—the Accursèd will be here, Or blacken yonder Sleemish with his crew Descending. Then those idiots, kerne and slave— The mighty flame into itself takes all— Full swarm will fly to meet him! Fool! fool! fool! The man hath snared me with those gifts he sent; Else had I barred the mountains: now 'twere late, My people in revolt. Whole weeks his horde Will throng my courts, demanding board and bed, With hosts by Dichu sent to flout my pang, And sorer make my charge. My granaries sacked, My larder lean as ship six months ice-bound, The man I hate will rise, and open shake The invincible banner of his mad new Faith, Till all that hear him shout, like winds or waves, Belief; and I be left sole recusant; Or else perhaps that Fury who prevails At times o'er knee-joints of reluctant men, By magic imped, may crumble into dust By force my disbelief.’ He raised his head, And lo, before him lay the sea far ebbed Sad with a sunset all but gone: the reeds Sighed in the wind, and sighed a sweeter voice Oft heard in childhood—now the last time heard: ‘Believe!’ it whispered. Vain the voice! That hour, Stirred from the abyss, the sins of all his life Around him rose like night—not one, but all— That earliest sin which, like a dagger, pierced His mother's heart; that worst, when summer drouth Parched the brown vales, and infants thirsting died, While from full pail he gorged his swine with milk And flung the rest away. Sin-walled he stood: God's Angels could not pierce that cincture dread, Nor he look through it. Yet he dreamed he saw: His life he saw; its labours, and its gains Hard won, long-waited, wonder of his foes; The manifold conquests of a Will oft tried; Victory, Defeat, Retrieval; last, that scene Around him spread: the wan sea and grey rocks; And he was 'ware that on that self-same ledge He, Milcho, thirty years gone by, had stood, While pirates pushed to sea, leaving forlorn On that wild shore a scared and weeping boy, (His price two yearling kids and half a sheep) Thenceforth his slave. Not sole he mused that hour. The Demon of his House beside him stood Upon that iron coast, and whispered thus: ‘Masterful man art thou for wit-and strength; Yet girl-like standst thou brooding! Weave a snare! He comes for gold, this prophet. All thou hast Heap in thy house; then fire it! In far lands Build thee new fortunes. Frustrate thus shall he Stare but on stones, his destined vassal scaped.’ So fell the whisper; and as one who hears And does, the stiff-necked man obsequious bent His strong will to a stronger, and returned, And gave command to heap within his house His stored up wealth—yea, all things that were his— Borne from his ships and granaries. It was done. Then filled he his huge hall with resinous beams Seasoned for far sea-voyage, and the ribs Of ocean-sundering vessels deep in sea; Which ended, to his topmost tower he clomb, And therein sat two days, with face to south, Clutching a brand; and oft through clenched teeth hissed, Hissed long, ‘Because I will to disbelieve.’ But ere the second sunset two brief hours, Where comfortless leaned forth that western ridge Long patched with whiteness by half melted snows, There crept a gradual shadow. Soon the man Discerned its import. There they hung—he saw them— That company detested; hung as when Storm-boding cloud on mountain hangs half-way Scarce moving, and in fear the shepherd cries, ‘Would that the worst were come!’ So dread to him Those Heralds of fair Peace! He gazed upon them With blood-shot eyes; a moment passed: he stood Sole in his never festal hall, and flung His lighted brand into that pile far forth, And smiled that smile men feared to see, and turned, And issuing faced the circle of his serfs That wondering gathered round in thickening mass, Eyeing that unloved House. His place he chose Beside that blighted ash, fronting those towers Palled with red smoke, and muttered low, ‘So be it! Worse to be vassal to the man I hate,’ With hueless lips. His whole white face that hour Was scorched; and blistered was the dead tree's bark; Yet there he stood; and in that fiery light His life, no more triumphant, passed once more In underthought before him, while on spread The swift, contagious madness of that fire, And muttered thus, not knowing it, the man, ‘The mighty flame into itself takes all,’ Mechanic iteration. Not alone Stood he that hour. The Demon of his House By him once more and closer than of old, Stood, whispering thus, ‘Thy game is now played out; Henceforth a byword art thou—rich in youth— Self-beggared in old age.’ And as the wind Of that shrill whisper cut his listening soul, The blazing roof fell in on all his wealth, Hard-won, long-waited, wonder of his foes; And, loud as laughter from ten thousand fiends, Up rushed the fire. With arms outstretched he stood; Stood firm; then forward with a wild beast's cry He dashed himself into that terrible flame, And vanished as a leaf. Upon a spur Of Sleemish, eastward on its northern slope, Stood Patrick and his brethren, travel-worn, When distant o'er the brown and billowy moor Rose the white smoke, that changed ere long to flame, From site unknown; for by the seaward crest That keep lay hidden. Hands to forehead raised, Wondering they watched it. One to other spake: ‘The huge Dalriad forest is afire Ere melted are the winter's snows!’ Another, ‘In vengeance o'er the ocean Creithe or Pict, Favoured by magic, or by mist, have crossed, And fired old Milcho's ships.’ But Patrick leaned Upon his crosier, pale as the ashes wan Left by a burned out city. Long he stood Silent, till, sudden, fiercelier soared the flame Reddening the edges of a cloud low hung; And, after pause, vibration slow and stern Troubling the burthened bosom of the air, Upon a long surge of the northern wind Came up—a murmur as of wintry seas Far borne at night. All heard that sound; all felt it; One only knew its import. Patrick turned; ‘The deed is done: the man I would have saved Is dead, because he willed to disbelieve.’ Yet Patrick grieved for Milcho, nor that hour Passed further north. Three days on Sleemish hill He dwelt in prayer. To Tara's royal halls Then turned he, and subdued the royal house And host to Christ, save Erin's king, Laeghaire. But Milcho's daughters twain to Christ were born In baptism, and each Emeria named: Like rose-trees in the garden of the Lord Grew they and flourished. Dying young, one grave Received them at Cluanbrain. Healing thence To many from their relics passed; to more The spirit's happier healing, Love and Faith. SAINT PATRICK AT TARA. The king is wroth with a greater wrath Than the wrath of Nial or the wrath of Conn! From his heart to his brow the blood makes path, And hangs there, a red cloud, beneath his crown. Is there any who knows not, from south to north, That Laeghaire to-morrow his birthday keeps? No fire may be lit upon hill or hearth Till the king's strong fire in its kingly mirth Up rushes from Tara's palace steeps! Yet Patrick has lighted his Paschal fire At Slane—it is holy Saturday— And blessed his font 'mid the chaunting choir! From hill to hill the flame makes way; While the king looks on it his eyes with ire Flash red, like Mars, under tresses grey. The chiefs and the captains with drawn swords rose: To avenge their Lord and the Realm they swore; The Druids rose and their garments tore; ‘The strangers to us and our Gods are foes!’ Then the king to Patrick a herald sent, Who spake, ‘Come up at noon and show Who lit thy fire and with what intent: These things the great king Laeghaire would know.’ But Laeghaire had hid twelve men by the way, Who swore by the sun the Saint to slay. When the waters of Boyne began to bask And fields to flash in the rising sun, The Apostle Evangelist kept his Pasch, And Erin her grace baptismal won: Her birthday it was: his font the rock, He blessed the land, and he blessed his flock. Then forth to Tara he fared full lowly: The Staff of Jesus was in his hand: Twelve priests paced after him chaunting slowly, Printing their steps on the dewy land. It was the Resurrection morn: The lark sang loud o'er the springing corn; The dove was heard, and the hunter's horn. The murderers twelve stood by on the way; Yet they saw nought save the lambs at play. A trouble lurked in the monarch's eye When the guest he counted for dead drew nigh: He sat in state at his palace gate; His chiefs and nobles were ranged around; The Druids like ravens smelt some far fate; Their eyes were gloomily bent on the ground. Then spake Laeghaire: ‘He comes—beware! Let none salute him, or rise from his chair!’ Like some still vision men see by night, Mitred, with eyes of serene command, Saint Patrick moved onward in ghostly white: The Staff of Jesus was in his hand; Twelve priests paced after him unafraid, And the boy, Benignus, more like a maid; Like a maid just wedded he walked and smiled, To Christ new plighted, that priestly child. They entered the circle; their anthem ceased; The Druids their eyes bent earthward still: On Patrick's brow the glory increased As a sunrise brightening some sea-beat hill. The warriors sat silent: strange awe they felt: The chief bard, Dubtach, rose and knelt! Then Patrick discoursed of the things to be When time gives way to eternity, Of kingdoms that fall, which are dreams not things, And the Kingdom built by the King of kings. Of Him he spake who reigns from the Cross; Of the death which is life, and the life which is loss; How all things were made by the Infant Lord, And the small hand the Magian kings adored. His voice sounded on like a throbbing flood That swells all night from some far-off wood, And when it ended—that wondrous strain— Invisible myriads breathed ‘Amen!’ While he spake, men say that the refluent tide On the shore by Colpa ceased to sink: They say that the white stag by Mulla's side O'er the green marge bending forbore to drink: That the Brandon eagle forgat to soar; That no leaf stirred in the wood by Lee: Such stupor hung the island o'er, For none might guess what the end would be. Then whispered the king to a chief close by, ‘It were better for me to believe than die!’ Yet the king believed not; but ordinance gave That whoso would might believe that word: So the meek believed, and the wise, and brave, And Mary's Son as their God adored. And the Druids, because they could answer nought, Bowed down to the Faith the stranger brought. That day on Erin God poured His Spirit: Yet none like the chief of the bards had merit, Dubtach! He rose and believed the first, Ere the great light yet on the rest had burst. SAINT PATRICK AND THE TWO PRINCESSES. FEDELM ‘THE RED ROSE,’ AND ETHNA ‘THE FAIR.’ Like two sister fawns that leap, Borne, as though on viewless wings, Down bosky glade and ferny steep To quench their thirst at silver springs, From Cruachan The palace of the Kings in Connaught. palace through gorse and heather, Raced the Royal Maids together. Since childhood thus the twain had rushed Each morn to Clebach's fountain-cell Ere earliest dawn the East had flushed To bathe them in its well: Each morn with joy their young hearts tingled; Each morn as, conquering cloud or mist, The first beam with the wavelet mingled, Mouth to mouth they kissed! They stand by the fount with their unlooped hair— A hand each raises—what see they there? A white Form seated on Clebach stone; A kinglike presence: the monks stood nigh: Fronting the dawn he sat alone; On the star of morning he fixed his eye: That crozier he grasped shone bright; but brighter The sunrise flashed from Saint Patrick's mitre! They gazed without fear. To a kingdom dear From the day of their birth those Maids had been; Of wrong they had heard; but it came not near; They hoped they were dear to the Power unseen. They knelt when that Vision of Peace they saw; Knelt, not in fear, but in loving awe: The ‘Red Rose’ bloomed like that East afar; The ‘Fair One ’shone like that morning star. Then Patrick rose: no word he said, But thrice he made the sacred Sign; At the first, men say that the demons fled; At the third flocked round them the Powers divine Unseen. Like children devout and good, Hands crossed on their bosoms, the maidens stood. ‘Blessed and holy! This land is Eire: Whence come ye to her, and the king our sire?’ ‘We come from a Kingdom far off, yet near, Which the wise love well, and the wicked fear: We come with blessing and come with ban, We come from the Kingdom of God with man.’ ‘Whose is that Kingdom? And say, therein Are the chiefs all brave, and the maids all fair? Is it clean from reptiles, and that thing, sin? Is it like this kingdom of King Laeghaire?’ ‘The chiefs of that Kingdom wage war on wrong, And the clash of their swords is sweet as song; Fair are the maids, and so pure from taint The flash of their eyes turns sinner to saint; There reptile is none, nor the ravening beast; There light has no shadow, no end the feast.’ ‘But say, at that feast hath the poor man place? Is reverence there for the old head hoar? For the cripple that never might join the race? For the maimed that fought, and can fight no more?’ ‘Reverence is there for the poor and meek; And the great King kisses the worn, pale cheek; And the King's Son waits on the pilgrim guest; And the Queen takes the little blind child to her breast: There with a crown is the just man crowned; But the false and the vengeful are branded and bound In knots of serpents, and flung without pity From the bastions and walls of the saintly City.’ Then the eyes of the Maidens grew dark, as though That judgment of God had before them passed: And the two sweet faces grew dim with woe; But the rose and the radiance returned at last. ‘Are gardens there? Are there streams like ours? Is God white-headed, or youthful and strong? Hang there the rainbows o'er happy bowers? Are there sun and moon and the thrush's song?’ ‘They have gardens there without noise or strife, And there is the Tree of immortal Life: Four rivers circle that blissful bound; And Spirits float o'er it, and Spirits go round: There, set in the midst, is the golden throne; And the Maker of all things sits thereon: A rainbow o'er-hangs Him; and lo! therein The beams are His Holy Ones washed from sin.’ As he spake, the hearts of the Maids beat time To music in heaven of peace and love; And the deeper sense of that lore sublime Came out from within them, and down from above; By degrees came down; by degrees came out: Who loveth, and hopeth, not long shall doubt. ‘Who is your God? Is love on His brow? Oh how shall we love Him and find Him? How?’ The pure cheek flamed like the dawn-touched dew: There was silence: then Patrick began anew. ‘The princes who ride in your father's train Have courted your love, but sued in vain;— Look up, O Maidens; make answer free: What boon desire you, and what would you be?’ ‘Pure we would be as yon wreath of foam, Or the ripple which now yon sunbeams smite: And joy we would have, and a songful home; And one to rule us, and Love's delight.’ ‘In love God fashioned whatever is, The hills, and the seas, and the skiey fires; For love He made them, and endless bliss Sustains, enkindles, uplifts, inspires: That God is Father, and Son, and Spirit; And the true and spotless His peace inherit: And God made man, with his great sad heart, That hungers when held from God apart. Your sire is a King on earth: but I Would mate you to One who is Lord on high: There bride is maid: and her joy shall stand, For the King's Son hath laid on her head His hand.’ As he spake, the eyes of that lovely twain Grew large with a tearful but glorious light, Like skies of summer late cleared by rain, When the full-orbed moon will be soon in sight. ‘That Son of the King—is He fairest of men? That mate whom He crowns—is she bright and blest? Does she chase the red deer at His side through the glen? Does she charm Him with song to His noontide rest?’ ‘That King's Son strove in a long, long war: His people He freed; yet they wounded Him sore; And still in His hands, and His feet, and His side, The scars of His sorrow are 'graved, deep-dyed.’ Then the breasts of the Maidens began to heave Like harbour waves when beyond the bar The great waves gather, and wet winds grieve, And the roll of the tempest is heard afar. ‘We will kiss, we will kiss those bleeding feet; On the bleeding hands our tears shall fall; And whatever on earth is dear or sweet, For that wounded heart we renounce them all. ‘Show us the way to His palace-gate:’— ‘That way is thorny, and steep, and straight; By none can His palace-gate be seen, Save those who have washed in the waters clean.’ They knelt: on their heads the wave he poured Thrice in the name of the Triune Lord: And he signed their brows with the Sign adored. On Fedelm the ‘Red Rose,’ on Ethna ‘The Fair,’ God's dew shone bright in that morning air: Some say that Saint Agnes, 'twixt sister and sister, As the Cross touched each, bent over and kissed her. Then sang God's new-born Creatures, ‘Behold! We see God's City from heaven draw nigh: But we thirst for the fountains divine and cold: We must see the great King's Son, or die! Come, Thou that com'st! Our wish is this, That the body might die, and the soul, set free, Swell out, like an infant's lips, to the kiss Of the Lover who filleth infinity!’ ‘The City of God, by the water's grace, Ye see: alone, they behold His Face, Who have washed in the baths of Death their eyes, And tasted His Eucharist Sacrifice.’ ‘Give us the Sacrifice!’ Each bright head Bent toward it as sunflowers bend to the sun: They ate; and the blood from the warm cheek fled: The exile was over: the home was won: A starry darkness o'erflowed their brain: Far waters beat on some heavenly shore: Like the dying away of a low, sweet strain, The young life ebbed, and they breathed no more: In death they smiled, as though on the breast Of the Mother Maid they had found their rest. The rumour spread: beside the bier The King stood mute, and his chiefs and court: The Druids dark-robed drew surlily near, And the Bards storm-hearted, and humbler sort: The ‘Staff of Jesus’ Saint Patrick raised: Angelic anthems above them swept: There were that muttered; there were that praised: But none who looked on that marvel wept. For they lay on one bed, like Brides new-wed, By Clebach well; and, the dirge days over, On their smiling faces a veil was spread, And a green mound raised that bed to cover. Such were the ways of those ancient days— To Patrick for aye that grave was given; And above it he built a church in their praise; For in them had Eire been spoused to heaven. SAINT PATRICK AND THE CHILDREN OF FOCHLUT WOOD. This wood extended along the coast near the present town of Killala. ARGUMENT. Saint Patrick makes way into Fochlut Wood by the sea, the oldest of Erin's forests, whence there had been borne unto him, then in a distant land, the Children's Wail from Erin. He meets there two young Virgins, who sing a dirge of man's sorrowful condition. Afterwards they lead him to the fortress of the king, their father. There are sung two songs, a song of Vengeance and a song of Lament; which ended, Saint Patrick makes proclamation of the Advent and of the Resurrection. The king and all his chiefs believe with full contentment. One day as Patrick sat upon a stone Judging his people, Pagan babes flocked round, All light and laughter, angel-like of mien, Sueing for bread. He gave it, and they ate: Then said he, ‘Kneel;’ and taught them prayer: but lo! Sudden the stag hounds' music dinned the wind; They heard; they sprang; they chased it. Patrick spake; ‘It was the cry of children that I heard Borne from the black wood o'er the midnight seas: Where are those children? What avails though Kings Have bowed before my Gospel, and in awe Nations knelt low, unless I set mine eyes On Fochlut Wood?’ Thus speaking, he arose, And, journeying with the brethren toward the West, Fronted the confine of that forest old. Then entered they that darkness; and the wood Closed as a cavern round them. O'er its roof Leaned roof of cloud, and hissing ran the wind, And moaned the trunks for centuries hollowed out Yet stalwart still. There, rooted in the rock, Stood the huge growths, by us unnamed, that frowned Perhaps on Partholan, the parricide, When that first Pagan settler fugitive Landed, a man foredoomed. Between the stems The ravening beast now glared, now fled. Red leaves, The last year's phantoms, rattled here and there. The oldest wood that ever grew in Eire Was Fochlut Wood, and gloomiest. Spirits of Ill Made it their Palace, and its labyrinths sowed With poisons. Many a cave, with horrors thronged, Within it yawned, and many a chasm unseen Waited the unwary treader. Cry of wolf Pierced the cold air, and gibbering ghosts were heard; And o'er the black marsh passed those wandering lights That lure lost feet. A thousand pathways wound From gloom to gloom. One only led to light; That path was sharp with flints. Then Patrick mused, ‘O life of man, how dark a wood art thou! Erring how many track thee till Despair, Sad host, receives them in his crypt-like porch At nightfall.’ Mute he paced. The brethren feared; And fearing, knelt to God. Made strong by prayer Westward once more they trod that dark, sharp way Till deeper gloom announced the night, then slept Guarded by angels. But the Saint all night Watched, strong in prayer. The second day still on They fared, like mariners o'er strange seas borne, That keep in mist their soundings when the rocks Vex the dark strait, and breakers roar unseen. At last Benignus cried, ‘To God be praise! He sends us better omens. See! the moss Brightens the crag!’ Ere long another spake: ‘The worst is past! This freshness in the air Wafts us a welcome from the great salt sea; Fair spreads the fern: green buds are on the spray, And violets throng the grass.’ A few steps more Brought them to where, with peaceful gleam, there spread A forest pool that mirrored yew trees twain With beads like blood-drops hung. A sunset flash Kindled a glory in the osiers brown Encircling that still water. From the reeds A sable bird, gold-circled, slowly rose; But when the towering tree-tops he outsoared, Eastward a great wind swept him as a leaf. Serenely as he rose a music soft Swelled from afar; but, as that storm o'ertook him The music changed to one on-rushing note O'ertaken by a second; both, ere long, Blended in wail unending. Patrick's brow, Listening that wail, was altered, and he spake: ‘These were the Voices that I heard when stood By night beside me in that southern land God's angel, girt for speed. Letters he bare Unnumbered, full of woes. He gave me one, Inscribed, “The Wailing of the Irish Race;” And as I read that legend on mine ear Forth from a mighty wood on Erin's coast There rang the cry of children, “Walk once more Among us; bring us help!”’ Thus Patrick spake: Then towards that wailing paced with forward head. Ere long they came to where a river broad Swiftly amid the dense trees winding, brimmed The flower-enamelled marge, and onward bore Green branches 'mid its eddies. On the bank Two virgins stood. Whiter than earliest streak Of matin pearl dividing dusky clouds Their raiment; and, as oft in silent woods White beds of wind-flower lean along the earth-breeze, So on the river-breeze that raiment wan Shivered, back blown. Slender they stood and tall, Their brows with violets bound; while shone, beneath, The dark blue of their never-tearless eyes. Then Patrick, ‘For the sake of Him who lays His blessing on the mourners, O ye maids, Reveal to me your grief—if yours late sent, Or sped in careless childhood.’ And the maids: ‘Happy whose careless childhood 'scaped the wound:’ Then she that seemed the saddest added thus: ‘Stranger! this forest is no roof of joy, Nor we the only mourners; neither fall Bitterer the widow's nor the orphan's tears Now than of old; nor sharper than long since That loss which maketh maiden widowhood. In childhood first our sorrow came. One eve Within our foster-parents' low-roofed house The winter sunset from our bed had waned: I slept, and sleeping dreamed. Beside the bed There stood a lovely Lady crowned with stars; A sword went through her heart. Down from that sword Blood trickled on the bed, and on the ground. Sorely I wept. The Lady spake: “My child, Weep not for me, but for thy country weep; Her wound is deeper far than mine. Cry loud! The cry of grief is Prayer.” I woke, all tears; And lo! my little sister, stiff and cold, Sat with wide eyes upon the bed upright: That starry Lady with the bleeding heart She, too, had seen, and heard her. Clamour vast Rang out; and all the wall was fiery red; And flame was on the sea. A hostile clan Landing in mist, had fired our ships and town, Our clansmen absent on a foray far, And stricken many an old man, many a boy To bondage dragged. Oh night with blood redeemed! Upon the third day o'er the green waves rushed The vengeance winged, with axe and torch, to quit Wrong with new wrong, and many a time since then. That night sad women on the sea sands toiled, Drawing from wreck and ruin, beam or plank To shield their babes. Our foster-parents slain, Unheeded we, the children of the chief, Roamed the great forest. There we told our dream To children likewise orphaned. Sudden fear Smote them as though themselves had dreamed that dream, And back from them redoubled upon us; Until at last from us and them rang out— The dark wood heard it, and the midnight sea— A great and bitter cry.’ ‘That cry went up, O children, to the heart of God; and He Down sent it, pitying, to a far-off land, And on into my heart. By that first pang Which left the eternal pallor in your cheeks, O maids, I pray you, sing once more that song Ye sang but late. I heard its long last note: Fain would I hear the song that such death died.’ They sang: not scathless those that sing such song! Grief, their instructress, of the Muses chief To hearts by grief unvanquished, to their hearts Had taught a melody that neither spared Singer nor listener. Pale when they began, Paler it left them. He not less was pale Who, out of trance awaking, thanked them thus: ‘Now know I of that sorrow in you fixed; What, and how great it is, and bless that Power Who called me forth from nothing for your sakes, And sent me to this wood. Maidens, lead on! A chieftain's daughters ye; and he, your sire, And with him she who gave you your sweet looks (Sadder perchance than you in songless age), They, too, must hear my tidings. Once a Prince Went solitary from His golden throne, Tracking the illimitable wastes, to find One wildered sheep, the meanest of the flock, And on His shoulders bore it to that House Where dwelt His Sire. “Good Shepherd” was His Name. My tidings these: heralds are we, footsore, That bring the heart-sore comfort.’ On they paced, On by the rushing river without words. Beside the elder sister Patrick walked, Benignus by the younger. Fair her face; Majestic his, though young. Her looks were sad And awe-struck; his, fulfilled with secret joy, Sent forth a gleam as when a morn-touched bay Through ambush shines of woodlands. Soon they stood Where sea and river met, and trod a path Wet with salt spray, and drank the clement breeze, And saw the quivering of the green gold wave, And, far beyond, that fierce aggressor's bourn, Fair haunt for savage race, a purple ridge By rainy sunbeam gemmed from glen to glen, Dim waste of wandering lights. The sun, half risen, Lay half sea-couched. A neighbouring height sent forth Welcome of baying hounds; and, close at hand, They reached the chieftain's keep. A white-haired man And long since blind, there sat he in his hall, Untamed by age. At times a fiery gleam Flashed from his sightless eyes; and oft the red Burned on his forehead, while with splenetic speech Stirred by ill news or memory-stung, he banned Foes and false friend. Pleased by his daughters' tale, At once he stretched his huge yet aimless hands In welcome towards his guests. Beside him stood His mate of forty years by that strong arm From countless suitors won. Pensive her face: With parted youth the confidence of youth Had left her. Beauty, too, though with remorse, Its seat had half relinquished on a cheek Long time its boast, and on that willowy form, So yielding now, where once in strength upsoared The queenly presence. Tenderest grace not less Haunted her life's dim twilight—meekness, love— That humble love, all-giving, that seeks nought, Self-reverent calm, and modesty in age. She turned an anxious eye on him she loved; And, bending, kissed at times that wrinkled hand, By years and sorrows made his wife far more Than in her nuptial bloom. These two had lost Five sons, their hope, in war. That eve it chanced High feast was holden in the chieftain's tower To solemnise his birthday. In they flocked, Each after each, the warriors of the clan, Not without pomp heraldic and fair state Barbaric, yet beseeming. Unto each Seat was assigned for deeds or lineage old, And to the chiefs allied. Where each had place Above him waved his banner. Not for this Unhonoured were the pilgrim guests. They sat Where, fed by pinewood and the seeded cone, The loud hearth blazed. Bathed were the wearied feet By maidens of the place and nurses grey, And dried in linen fragrant still with flowers Of years when those old nurses too were fair. And now the board was spread, and carved the meat, And jests ran round, and many a tale was told, Some rude, but none opprobrious. Banquet done, Page-led the harper entered, old, and blind: The noblest ranged his chair, and spread the mat; The loveliest raised his wine cup, one light hand Laid on his shoulder, while the golden hair Commingled with the silver. ‘Sing,’ they cried, ‘The death of Deirdrè; or that desolate sire That slew his son, unweeting; or that Queen Who from her palace pacing with fixed eyes Stared at those heads in dreadful circle ranged, The heads of traitor-friends that slew her lord Then mocked the friend they murdered. Leal and true, The Bard who wrought that vengeance!’ Thus he sang: ‘THE LAY OF THE HEADS.’ The Bard returns to a stricken house: What shape is that he rears on high? A withe of the Willow, set round with Heads: They blot that evening sky. A Widow meets him at the gates: What fixes thus that Widow's eye? She names the name; but she sees not the man, Nor beyond him that reddening sky. ‘Bard of the Brand, thou Foster-Sire Of him they slew—their friend—my lord— What Head is that—the first—that frowns Like a traitor self-abhorred?’ ‘Daughter of Orgill wounded sore, Thou of the fateful eye serene, Fergus is he. The feast he made That snared thy Cuchullene.’ ‘What Head is that—the next—half-hid In curls full lustrous to behold? They mind me of a hand that once I saw amid their gold.’ ‘'Tis Manadh. He that by the shore Held rule, and named the waves his steeds: 'Twas he that struck the stroke accursed— Headless this day he bleeds.’ ‘What Head is that close by—so still, With half-closed lids, and lips that smile? Methinks I know their voice: methinks His wine they quaffed erewhile!’ ‘'Twas he raised high that severed head: Thy head he raised, my Foster-Child! That was the latest stroke I struck: I struck that stroke, and smiled.’ ‘What Heads are those—that twain, so like, Flushed as with blood by yon red sky?’ ‘Each unto each, his Head they rolled; Red on that grass they lie.’ ‘That paler twain, which face the East?’ ‘Laegar is one; the other Hilt; Silent they watched the sport! they share The doom, that shared the guilt.’ ‘Bard of the Vengeance! well thou knew'st Blood cries for blood! O kind, and true, How many, kith and kin, have died That mocked the man they slew?’ ‘O Woman of the fateful eye, The untrembling voice, the marble mould, Seven hundred men, in house or field, For the man they mocked, lie cold.’ ‘Their wives, thou Bard? their wives? their wives? Far off, or nigh, through Inisfail, This hour what are they? Stand they mute Like me; or make their wail?’ ‘O Eimer! women weep and smile; The young have hope, the young that mourn; But I am old; my hope was he: He that can ne'er return!’ ‘O Conal! lay me in his grave: Oh! lay me by my husband's side: Oh! lay my lips to his in death;’ She spake, and, standing, died. She fell at last—in death she fell— She lay, a black shade, on the ground; And all her women o'er her wailed Like sea-birds o'er the drowned. Thus to the blind chief sang that harper blind, Hymning the vengeance; and the great hall roared With wrath of those wild listeners. Many a heel Smote the rough stone in scorn of them that died Not three days past, so seemed it! Direful hands, Together dashed, thundered the Avenger's praise. At last the tide of that fierce tumult ebbed O'er shores of silence. From her lowly seat Beside her husband's spake the gentle Queen: ‘My daughters, from your childhood ye were still A voice of music in your father's house— Not wrathful music. Sing that song ye made Or found long since, and yet in forest sing, If haply Power Unknown may hear and help.’ She spake, and at her word her daughters sang. ‘Lost, lost, all lost! O tell us what is lost? Behold, this too is hidden! Let him speak, If any knows. The wounded deer can turn And see the shaft that quivers in its flank; The bird looks back upon its broken wing; But we, the forest children, only know Our grief is infinite, and hath no name. What woman-prophet, shrouded in dark veil, Whispered a Hope sadder than Fear? Long since, What Father lost His children in the wood? Some God? And can a God forsake? Perchance His face is turned to nobler worlds new-made; Perchance his palace owns some later bride That hates the dead Queen's children, and with charm Prevails that they are exiled from his eyes, The exile's winter theirs—the exile's song. ‘Blood, ever blood! The sword goes raging on O'er hill and moor; and with it, iron-willed, Drags on the hand that holds it and the man To slake its ceaseless thirst for blood of men; Fire takes the little cot beside the mere, And leaps upon the upland village: fire Up clambers to the castle on the crag; And whom the fire has spared the hunger kills; And earth draws all into her thousand graves. ‘Ah me! the little linnet knows the branch Whereon to build; the honey-pasturing bee Knows the wild heath, and how to shape its cell; Upon the poisonous berry no bird feeds; So well their mother, Nature, helps her own. Mothers forsake not;—can a Father hate? Who knows but that He yearns—that Sire Unseen— To clasp His children? All is sweet and sane, All, all save man! Sweet is the summer flower, The day-long sunset of the autumnal woods; Fair is the winter frost; in spring the heart Shakes to the bleating lamb. O then what thing Might be the life secure of man with man, The infant's smile, the mother's kiss, the love Of lovers, and the untroubled wedded home? This might have been man's lot. Who sent the woe? Who formed man first? Who taught him first the ill way? One creature, only, sins; and he the highest! ‘O Higher than the highest! Thou Whose hand Made us—Who shaped'st that hand Thou wilt not clasp, The eye Thou open'st not, the sealed-up ear! Be mightier than man's sin: for lo, how man Seeks Thee, and ceases not: through noontide cave And dark air of the dawn-unlighted peak To Thee how long he strains the weak, worn eye If haply he might see Thy vesture's hem On farthest winds receding! Yea, how oft Against the blind and tremulous wall of cliff Tormented by sea surge, he leans his ear If haply o'er it name of Thine might creep; Or bends above the torrent-cloven abyss, If falling flood might lisp it! Power unknown! He hears it not: Thou hear'st his beating heart That cries to Thee for ever! From the veil That shrouds Thee, from the wood, the cloud, the void, O, by the anguish of all lands evoked, Look forth! Though, seeing Thee, man's race should die, One moment let him see Thee! Let him lay At least his forehead on Thy foot in death!’ So sang the maidens: but the warriors frowned; And thus the blind king muttered, ‘Bootless weed Is plaint where help is none!’ But wives and maids And the thick-crowding poor, that many a time Had wailed on war-fields o'er their brethren slain, Went down before that strain as river reeds Before strong wind, went down when o'er them passed Its last word, ‘Death’; and grief's infection spread From least to first; and weeping filled the hall. Then on Saint Patrick fell compassion great; He rose amid that concourse, and with voice And words now lost, alas, or all but lost, Such that the chief of sight amerced, beheld The imagined man before him crowned with light, Proclaimed that God who hideth not His face, His people's King and Father; open flung The portals of His realm, that inward rolled, With music of a million singing spheres Commanded all to enter. Who was He Who called the worlds from nought? His name is Love! In love He made those worlds. They have not lost, The sun his splendour, nor the moon her light: That miracle survives. Alas for thee! Thou better miracle, fair human love, That splendour shouldst have been of home and hearth, Now quenched by mortal hate! Whence come our woes But from our lusts? O desecrated law By God's own finger on our hearts engraved, How well art thou avenged! No dream it was, That primal greatness, and that primal peace: Man in God's image at the first was made, A God to rule below! He told it all— Creation, and that Sin which marred its face; And how the great Creator, creature made, God—God for man incarnate—died for man: Dead, with His Cross he thundered on the gates Of Death's blind Hades. Then, with hands outstretched, His Holy Ones that, in their penance prison From hope in Him had ceased not, to the light Flashed from His bleeding hands and branded brow Through darkness soared: they reign with Him in heaven: Their brethren we, the children of one Sire. Long time he spake. The winds forbore their wail; The woods were hushed. That wondrous tale complete. Not sudden fell the silence; for, as when A huge wave forth from ocean toiling mounts High-arched, in solid bulk, the beach rock-strewn, Burying his hoar head under echoing cliffs, And, after pause, refluent to sea returns, Not all at once is stillness, countless rills Or devious winding down the steep, or borne In crystal leap from sea-shelf to sea-well, And sparry grot replying; gradual thus With lessening cadence sank that great discourse, While round him gazed Saint Patrick, now the old Regarding, now the young, and flung on each In turn his boundless heart, and gazing longed As only Apostolic heart can long To help the helpless. ‘Fair, O friends, the bourn We dwell in! Holy King makes happy land: Our King is in our midst. He gave us gifts; Laws that are Love, the sovereignty of Truth. What, sirs, ye knew Him not! But ye by signs Foresaw His coming, as, when buds are red Ye say, “The spring is nigh us.” Him, unknown, Each loved who loved his brother! Shepherd youths, Who spread the pasture green beneath your lambs And freshened it with snow-fed stream and mist? Who but that Love unseen? Grey mariners, Who lulled the rough seas round your midnight nets, And sent the landward breeze? Pale sufferers wan, Rejoice! His are ye; yea, and His the most! Have ye not watched the eagle that upstirs Her nest, then undersails her falling brood And stays them on her plumes, and bears them up Till, taught by proof, they learn their unguessed powers And breast the storm? Thus God stirs up His people; Thus proves by pain. Ye too, O hearths well-loved! How oft your sin-stained sanctities ye mourned! Wives! from the cradle reigns the Bethelem Babe! Maidens! henceforth the Virgin Mother spreads Her shining veil above you! ‘Speak aloud, Chieftains world-famed! I hear the ancient blood That leaps against your hearts! What? Warriors ye! Danger your birthright, and your pastime death! Behold your foes! They stand before you plain: Ill passions, base ambitions, falsehood, hate: Wage war on these! A King is in your host! His hands no roses plucked but on the Cross: He came not hand of man in woman's tasks To mesh. In woman's hand, in childhood's hand, Much more in man's, He lodged His conquering sword; Them too His soldiers named, and vowed to war. Rise, clan of Kings, rise, champions of man's race, Heaven's sun-clad army militant on earth, One victory gained, the realm decreed is ours. The bridal bells ring out, for Low with High Is wed in endless nuptials. It is past, The sin, the exile, and the grief. O man, Take thou, renewed, thy sister-mate by hand; Know well thy dignity, and hers: return, And meet once more Thy Maker, for He walks Once more within thy garden, in the cool Of the world's eve!’ The words that Patrick spake Were words of power. Not futile did they fall: But, probing, healed a sorrowing people's wound. Round him they stood, as oft in Grecian days, Some haughty city sieged, her penitent sons Thronging green Pnyx or templed Forum hushed Hung listening on that People's one true Voice, The man that ne'er had flattered, ne'er deceived, Nursed no false hope. It was the time of Faith; Open was then man's ear, open his heart: Pride spurned not then that chiefest strength of man The power, by Truth confronted, to believe. Not savage was that wild, barbaric race: Spirit was in them. On their knees they sank, With foreheads lowly bent; and when they rose Such sound went forth as when late anchored fleet Touched by dawn breeze, shakes out its canvas broad And sweeps into new waters. Man with man Clasped hands; and each in each a something saw Till then unseen. As though flesh-bound no more, Their souls had touched. One Truth, the Spirit's life, Lived in them all, a vast and common joy. And yet as when, that Pentecostal morn, Each heard the Apostle in his native tongue, So now, on each, that Truth, that Joy, that Life Shone forth with beam diverse. Deep peace to one Those tidings seemed, a still vale after storm; To one a sacred rule, steadying the world; A third exulting saw his youthful hope Written in stars; a fourth triumphant hailed The just cause, long oppressed. Some laughed, some wept: But she, that aged chieftain's mournful wife Clasped to her boding breast his hoary head Loud clamouring, ‘Death is dead; and not for long That dreadful grave can part us.’ Last of all, He too believed. That hoary head had shaped Full many a crafty scheme:—behind them all Nature held fast her own. O happy night! Back through the gloom of centuries sin-defaced With what a saintly radiance thou dost shine! They slept not, on the loud-resounding shore In glory roaming. Many a feud that night Lay down in holy grave, or, mockery made, Was quenched in its own shame. Far shone the fires Crowning dark hills with gladness: soared the song; And heralds sped from coast to coast to tell How He the Lord of all, no Power Unknown But like a man rejoicing in his house, Ruled the glad earth. That demon-haunted wood, Sad Erin's saddest region, yet, men say, Tenderest for all its sadness, rang at last With hymns of men and angels. Onward sailed High o'er the long, unbreaking, azure waves A mighty moon, full-faced, as though on winds Of rapture borne. With earliest red of dawn Northward once more the wingèd war-ships rushed Swift as of old to that long hated shore— Not now with axe and torch. His Name they bare Who linked in one the nations. On a cliff Where Fochlut's Wood blackened the northern sea A convent rose. Therein those sisters twain Whose cry had summoned Patrick o'er the deep, Abode, no longer weepers. Pallid still, In radiance now their faces shone; and sweet Their psalms amid the clangour of rough brine. Ten years in praise to God and good to men, That happy precinct housed them. In their morn Grief had for them her great work perfected; Their eve was bright as childhood. When the hour Came for their blissful transit, from their lips Pealed forth ere death that great triumphant chant Sung by the Virgin Mother. Ages passed; And, year by year, on wintry nights, that song Alone the sailors heard—a cry of joy. SAINT PATRICK AND KING LAEGHAIRE. ‘Thou son of Calphurn, in peace go forth! This hand shall slay them whoe'er shall slay thee! The earles shall stand to their necks in earth Till they die of thirst who mock or stay thee! ‘But my father, Nial, who is dead long since, Permits not me to believe thy word; For the servants of Jesus, thy heavenly Prince, Once dead, lie flat as in sleep, interred: But we are as men that through dark floods wade; We stand in our black graves undismayed; Our faces are turned to the race abhorred, And at each hand by us stand spear or sword, Ready to strike at the last great day, Ready to trample them back into clay! ‘This is my realm, and men call it Eire Wherein I have lived and live in hate Like Nial before me and Erc his sire, Of the race Lagenian, ill-named the Great!’ Thus spake Laeghaire, and his host rushed on, A river of blood as yet unshed:— At noon they fought: and at set of sun That king lay captive, that host lay dead! The Lagenian loosed him, but bade him swear He would never demand of them Tribute more: So Laeghaire by the dread ‘God-Elements’ swore, By the moon divine and the earth and air; He swore by the wind and the broad sunshine That circle for ever both land and sea, By the long-backed rivers, and mighty wine, By the cloud far-seeing, by herb and tree, By the boon spring shower, and by autumn's fan. By woman's breast, and the head of man, By Night and the noonday Demon he swore He would claim the Boarian Tribute no more. But with time wrath waxed; and he brake his faith: Then the dread ‘God-Elements’ wrought his death; For the Wind and Sun-Strength by Cassi's side Came down and smote on his head that he died. Death-sick three days on his throne he sate; Then died, as his father died, great in hate. They buried their king upon Tara's hill, In his grave upright—there stands he still: Upright there stands he as men that wade By night through a castle-moat, undismayed; On his head is the crown; the spear in his hand; And he looks to the hated Lagenian land. Such rites in the time of wrath and wrong Were Eire's: baptized, they were hers no longer: For Patrick had taught her his sweet new song, ‘Though hate is strong, yet love is stronger.’ SAINT PATRICK AND THE IMPOSTOR; OR, MAC KYLE OF MAN. ARGUMENT. Mac Kyle, a child of death, dwells in a forest with other men like unto himself, that slay whom they will. Saint Patrick coming to that wood, a certain Impostor devises how he may be deceived and killed; but God smites the Impostor through his own snare, and he dies. Mac Kyle believes, and demanding penance is baptized. Afterwards he preaches in Manann The Isle of Man. Isle, and becomes a great Saint. In Uladh, near Magh Inis, lived a chief, Fierce man and fell. From orphaned childhood he Through lawless youth to blood-stained middle age Had rushed as stormy morn to stormier noon, Working, except that still he spared the poor, All wrongs with iron will; a child of death. Thus spake he to his followers, while the woods Snow-cumbered creaked, their scales of icy mail Angered by winter winds: ‘At last he comes, He that deceives the people with great signs, And for the tinkling of a little gold Preaches new Gods. Where rises yonder smoke Beyond the pinewood, camps this Lord of Dupes: How say ye? Shall he track o'er Uladh's plains, As o'er the land beside, his venomous way? Forth with your swords! and if that God he serves Can save him, let him prove it!’ Dark with wrath Thus spake Mac Kyle; and all his men approved, Shouting, while downward fell the snows hard-caked Loosened by shock of forest-echoed hands, Save Garban. Crafty he, and full of lies, That thing which Patrick hated. Sideway first Glancing, as though some secret foe were nigh, He spake: ‘Mac Kyle! a counsel for thine ear! A man of counsel I, as thou of war! The people love this stranger. Patrick slain, Their wrath will blaze against us, and demand An eric for his head. Let us by craft Unravel first his craft: then safe our choice; We slay a traitor, or great ransom take: Impostors lack not gold. Lay me as dead Upon a bier: above me spread yon cloth, And make your wail: and when the seer draws nigh Worship him, crying, “Lo, our friend is dead! Kneel, prophet, kneel, and pray that God thou serv'st To raise him.” If he kneels, no prophet he, But like the race of mortals. Sweep the cloth Straight from my face; then, laughing, I will rise.’ Thus counselled Garban; and the counsel pleased; Yet pleased not God. Upon a bier, branch-strewn, They laid their man, and o'er him spread a cloth; Then, moving towards that smoke behind the pines, They found the Saint and brought him to that bier, And made their moan—and Garban 'neath that cloth Smiled as he heard it—‘Lo, our friend is dead! Great prophet, kneel; and pray the God thou serv'st To raise him from the dead.’ The man of God Upon them fixed a sentence-speaking eye: ‘Yea! he is dead. In this ye have not lied: Behold, this day shall Garban's covering be The covering of the dead. Remove that cloth.’ Then drew they from his face the cloth; and lo! Beneath it Garban lay, a corpse stone-cold. Amazement fell upon that bandit throng, Contemplating that corpse, and on Mac Kyle Grief for his friend, remorse, and strong belief, A threefold power: for she that at his birth, Her brief life faithful to that Law she knew, Had died, in region where desires are crowned That hour was strong in prayer. ‘From God he came,’ Thus cried they; ‘and we worked a work accursed, Tempting God's prophet.’ Patrick heard, and spake; ‘Not me ye tempted, but the God I serve.’ At last Mac Kyle made answer: ‘I have sinned; I, and this people, whom I made to sin: Now therefore to thy God we yield ourselves Liegemen henceforth, his thralls as slave to Lord, Or horse to master. That which thou command'st That will we do.’ And Patrick said, ‘Believe; Confess your sins; and be baptized to God, The Father, and the Son, and Holy Spirit, And live true life.’ Then Patrick where he stood Above the dead, with hands uplifted preached To these in anguish and in terror bowed The tidings of great joy from Bethlehem's Crib To Calvary's Cross. Sudden upon his knees, Heart-pierced, as though he saw that Head thornpierced, Fell that wild chief, and was baptized to God; And, lifting up his great strong hands, while still The waters streamed adown his matted locks, He cried, ‘Alas, my master, and my sire! I sinned a mighty sin; for in my heart Fixed was my purpose, soon as thou hadst knelt, To slay thee with my sword. Therefore judge thou What eric I must pay to quit my sin?’ Him Patrick answered, ‘God shall be thy Judge: Arise, and to the seaside flee, as one That flies his foe. There shalt thou find a boat Made of one hide: eat nought, and nothing take Except one cloak alone: but in that boat Sit thou, and bear the sin-mark on thy brow, Facing the waves, oarless and rudderless; And bind the boat chain thrice around thy feet, And fling the key with strength into the main, Far as thou canst: and wheresoe'er the breath Of God shall waft thee, there till death abide Working the Will Divine.’ Then spake that chief, ‘I, that commanded others, can obey; Such lore alone is mine: but for this man That sinned my sin, alas, to see him thus!’ To whom the Saint, ‘For him, when thou art gone, My prayer shall rise. If God will raise the dead He knows: not I.’ Then rose that chief, and rushed Down to the shore, as one that flies his foe; Nor ate, nor drank, nor spake to wife or child, But loosed a little boat, of one hide made, And sat therein, and round his ankles wound The boat chain thrice; and flung the key far forth Above the ridged sea foam. The Lord of all Gave ordinance to the wind, and, as a leaf Swift rushed that boat, oarless and rudderless, Over the on-shouldering, broad-backed, glaucous wave Slow-rising like the rising of a world, And purple wastes beyond, with funeral plume Crested, a pallid pomp. All night the chief Under the roaring tempest heard the voice That preached the Son of Man; and when the morn Shone out, his coracle drew near the surge Reboant on Manann's Isle. Not unbeheld Rose it, and fell; not unregarded danced A black spot on the inrolling ridge, then hung Suspense upon the mile-long cataract That, overtoppling, changed grass-green to light, And drowned the shores in foam. Upon the sands Two white-haired Elders in the salt air knelt, Offering to God their early orisons, Coninri and Romael. Sixty years These two unto a hard and stubborn race Had preached the Word; and gaining by their toil But thirty souls, had daily prayed their God To send ere yet they died some ampler arm, And reap the ill-grown harvest of their youth. Ten years they prayed, not doubting, and from God, Who hastens not, this answer had received, ‘Ye shall not die until ye see his face.’ Therefore, each morning, peered they o'er the waves, Long-watching. These through breakers dragged the man, Their wished-for prize, half-frozen, and nigh to death, And bare him to their cell, and warmed and fed him, And heaped his couch with skins. Deep sleep he slept Till evening lay upon the level sea With roses strewn like bridal chamber's floor: Within it one star shone. Rested, he woke And sought the shore. From earth, and sea, and sky, Then passed into his spirit the Spirit of Love: And there he vowed his vow, fierce chief no more, But soldier of the cross. The weeks ran on, And daily those grey Elders ministered God's teaching to that chief, demanding still, ‘Son, understandst thou? Gird thee like a man To clasp, and hold, the total Faith of Christ, And give us leave to die.’ The months fled fast: Ere violets bloomed, he knew the creed; and when Far heathery hills purpled the autumnal air, He sang the psalter whole. That tale he told Had power, and Patrick's name. His strenous arm Labouring with theirs, reaped harvest heavy and sound, Till wondering gazed their wearied eyes on barns Knee-deep in grain. At last an eve there fell, When, on the shore in commune, with such might Discoursed that pilgrim of the things of God, Such insight calm, and wisdom reverence-born, Each on the other gazing in their hearts Received once more an answer from the Lord, ‘Now is your task completed: ye shall die.’ Then on the red sand knelt those Elders twain With hands upraised, and all their hoary hair Tinged like the foam-wreaths by that setting sun, And sang their ‘Nunc Dimittis.’ At its close High on the sandhills, 'mid the tall hard grass That sighed eternal o'er the unbounded waste With ceaseless yearnings like their own for death They found the place where first, that bark descried, Their sighs were changed to songs. That spot they marked, And said, ‘Our resurrection place is here:’ And, on the third day dying, in that place The man who loved them laid them, at their heads Planting one cross because their hearts were one And one their lives. The snowy-breasted bird Of ocean o'er their undivided graves Oft flew with wailing note; but they rejoiced 'Mid God's high realm glittering in endless youth. These two with Christ, on him, their son in Christ, Their mantle fell; and strength to him was given. Long time he toiled alone; then round him flocked Helpers from far. At last, by voice of all He gat the Island's great episcopate, And king-like ruled the region. This is he, Mac Kyle of Uladh, bishop, and Penitent, Saint Patrick's missioner in Manann's Isle, Sinner one time, and, after sinner, Saint World-famous. May his prayer for sinners plead! SAINT PATRICK AT CASHEL; OR, THE BAPTISM OF AENGUS. ARGUMENT. Saint Patrick goes to Cashel of the Kings to celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation. Aengus, who reigns there, receives him with all honour. He and his people believe, and by Baptism are added unto the Church. Aengus desires to resign his sovereignty, and become a monk. The Saint suffers not this, because he had discovered by two notable signs, both at the baptism of Aengus and before it, that the Prince is of those who are called by God to rule men. When Patrick now o'er Ulster's forest bound, And Connact, echoing to the western wave, And Leinster, fair with hill-suspended woods, Had raised the cross, and where the deep night ruled, Splendour had sent of everlasting light, Sole peace of warring hearts, to Munster next, Thomond and Desmond, Heber's portion old, He turned; and, fired by love that mocks at rest Pushed on through raging storm the whole night long, Intent to hold the Annunciation Feast At Cashel of the Kings. The royal keep High-seated on its Rock, as morning broke Faced them at last; and at the self-same hour Aengus, in his father's absence lord, Rising from happy sleep and heaven-sent dreams Went forth on duteous tasks. With sudden start The prince stept back; for, o'er the fortress court Like grove storm-levelled lay the idols huge, False gods and foul that long had awed the land, Prone, without hand of man. O'er-awed he gazed; Then on the air there rang a sound of hymns, And by the eastern gate Saint Patrick stood, The brethren round him. On their shaggy garb Auroral mist, struck by the rising sun, Glittered, that diamond-panoplied they seemed, And as a heavenly vision. At that sight The youth, descending with a wildered joy, Welcomed his guests: and, ere an hour, the streets Sparkled far down like flowering meads in spring, So thronged the folk in holiday attire To see the man far-famed. ‘Who spurns our gods!’ Once they had cried in wrath: but, year by year, Tidings of some deliverance great and strange, Some life more noble, some sublimer hope, Some regal race enthroned beyond the grave, Had reached them from afar. The best believed, Great hearts for whom nor earthly love sufficed Nor earthly fame. The meaner scoffed: yet all Desired the man. Delay had edged their thirst. Then Patrick, standing up among them, spake, And God was with him. Not as when loose tongue Babbles vain rumour, or the Sophist spins Thought's air-hung cobwebs gay with Fancy's dews, Spake he, but words of might, as when a man Bears witness to the things which he has seen, And tells of that he knows: and as the harp Attested is by rapture of the ear, And sunlight by consenting of the eye That, seeing, knows it sees, and neither craves Inferior demonstration, so his words Self-proved, went forth and conquered: for man's mind, Created in His image who is Truth, Challenged by truth, with recognizing voice Cries out ‘Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone,’ And cleaves thereto. In all that listening host One vast, dilating heart yearned to its God. Then burst the bond of years. No haunting doubt They knew. God dropped on them the robe of Truth Sun-like: down fell the many-coloured weed Of error: and, reclothed ere yet unclothed, They walked a new-born earth. The blinded Past Fled, vanquished. Glorious more than strange it seemed That He who fashioned man should come to man, And raise by ruling. They, His trumpet heard, In glory spurned demons misdeemed for gods: The great chief had returned: the clan enthralled Trod down the usurping foe. Then rose the cry, ‘Join us to Christ!’ His strong eyes on them set, Patrick replied, ‘Know ye what thing ye seek, Ye that would fain be house-mates with my King? Ye seek His Cross!’ He paused, then added slow: ‘If ye be liegeful, sirs, decree the day, His baptism shall be yours.’ That eve, while shone The sunset on the green-touched woods, that, grazed By onward flight of unalighting spring, Caught warmth yet scarcely flamed, Aengus stood With Patrick in a westward-facing tower Which overlooked far regions town-besprent, And lit with winding waters. Thus he spake: ‘My Father! what is sovereignty of man? Say, can I shield yon host from death, from sin, Taking them up into my breast, like God? I trow not so! Mine be the lowliest place Following thy King who left his Father's throne To walk the lowliest!’ Patrick answered thus: ‘Best lot thou choosest, son. If thine that lot Thou know'st not yet; nor I. The Lord, thy God, Will teach us.’ When the day decreed had dawned Loud rang the bull-horn; and on every breeze Floated the banners, saffron, green, and blue; While issuing from the horizon's utmost verge The full-voiced People flocked. So swarmed of old Some migratory nation, instinct-urged To fly their native wastes sad winter's realm; So thronged on southern slopes when, far below, Shone out the plains of promise. Bright they came! No summer sea could wear a blithsomer sheen Though every dancing crest and milky plume Ran on with rainbows braided. Minstrel songs Wafted like winds those onward hosts, or swayed Or stayed them; while among them heralds passed Lifting white wands of office. Foremost rode Aileel, the younger brother of the prince: He ruled a milk-white horse. Fluttered, breeze-borne His mantle green, while all his golden hair Streamed back redundant from the ring of gold Circling his head uncovered. Loveliest light Of innocence and joy was on that face: Full well the young maids marked it! Brighter yet Beamed he, his brother noting. On the verge Of Cashel's Rock that hour Aengus stood, By Patrick's side. That concourse nearer now He gazed upon it, crying, with clasped hands, ‘My Father, fair is sunrise, fair the sea, The hills, the plains, the wind-stirred wood, the maid; But what is like a People onward borne In gladness? When I see that sight, my heart Expands like palace-gates wide open flung That say to all men, “Enter.”’ Then the Saint Laid on that royal head a hand of might, And said, ‘The Will of God decrees thee King! Son of this People art thou: Sire one day Thou shalt be! Son and Sire in one are King. Shepherd for God thy flock, thou Shepherd true!’ He spake: that word was ratified in Heaven. Meantime that multitude innumerable Had reached the Rock, and, now the winding road In pomp ascending, faced those fair-wrought gates Which, by the warders at the prince's sign Drawn back, to all gave entrance. In they streamed, Filling the central courtway. Patrick stood High stationed on a prostrate idol's base, In vestments of the Vigil of that Feast The Annunciation, which with annual boon Whispers, while melting snows dilate those streams Purer than snows, to universal earth That Maiden Mother's joy. The Apostle watched The advancing throng, and gave them welcome thus: ‘As though into the great Triumphant Church, O guests of God, ye flock! Her place is Heaven: Sirs! we this day are militant below: Not less, advance in faith. Behold your crowns— Obedience and Endurance.’ There and then The Rite began: his people's Chief and Head Beside the font Aengus stood; his face Sweet as a child's, yet grave as front of eld: For reverence he had laid his crown aside, And from the deep hair to the unsandalled feet Was raimented in white. With mitred head And massive book, forward Saint Patrick leaned, Stayed by the gem-wrought crosier. Prayer on prayer Went up to God; while gift on gift from God, All Angel-like, invisibly to man, Descended. Thrice above that princely brow Patrick the cleansing waters poured, and traced Three times thereon the Venerable Sign, Naming the Name Triune. The Rite complete, A westruck that concourse downward gazed. At last Lifting their eyes, they marked the prince's face That pale it was though bright, anguished and pale, While from his naked foot a blood-stream gushed And o'er the pavement welled. The crosier's point, Weighted with weight of all that priestly form, Had pierced it through. ‘Why suffer'dst thou so long The pain in silence?’ Patrick spake, heart-grieved: Smiling, Aengus answered, ‘O my Sire, I thought, thus called to follow Him whose feet Were pierced with nails, haply the blissful Rite Bore witness to their sorrows.’ At that word The large eyes of the Apostolic man Grew larger; and within them lived that light Not fed by moon or sun, a visible flash Of that invisible lightning which from God Vibrates ethereal through the world of souls, Vivific strength of Saints. The mitred brow Uptowered sublime: the strong, yet wrinkled hands, Ascending, ceased not, till the crosier's head Glittered above the concourse like a star. At last his hands disparting, down he drew From Heaven the Royal Blessing, speaking thus: ‘For this cause may the blessing, Sire of kings, Cleave to thy seed for ever! Spear and sword Before them fall! In glory may the race Of Nafrach's sons, Aengus, and Aileel, Hold sway on Cashel's summit! Be their kings Great-hearted men, potent to rule and guard Their people; just to judge them; warriors strong; Sage counsellors; faithful shepherds; men of God, That so through them the everlasting King May flood their land with blessing.’ Thus he spake: And round him all that nation said, ‘Amen.’ Thus held they feast in Cashel of the Kings That day till all that land was clothed with Christ: And when the parting came from Cashel's steep Patrick the People's Blessing thus forth sent: ‘The Blessing fall upon the pasture broad, On fruitful mead, and every corn-clad hill, And woodland rich with flowers that children love: Unnumbered be the homesteads, and the hearths:— A blessing on the women, and the men, On youth, and maiden, and the suckling babe: A blessing on the fruit-bestowing tree, And foodful river tide. Be true; be pure, Not living from below, but from above, As men that over-top the world. And raise Here, on this rock, high place of idols once, A kingly church to God. The same shall stand For aye, or, wrecked, from ruin rise restored, His witness till He cometh. Over Eire The Blessing speed till time shall be no more From Cashel of the Kings.’ The Saint fared forth: The People bare him through their kingdom broad With banner and with song; but o'er its bound The women of that People followed still A half day's journey with lamenting voice; Then silent knelt, lifting their babes on high; And, crowned with two-fold blessing, home returned. SAINT PATRICK AND THE CHILDLESS MOTHER. ARGUMENT. Saint Patrick finds an aged Pagan Woman making great lamentation above a tomb which she believes to be that of her son. He kneels beside her in prayer, while around them a wondrous tempest sweeps. After a long time, he declares unto her the Death of Christ, and how, through that Death, the Dead are blessed. Lastly, he dissuades her from her rage of grief, and admonishes her to pray for her son on a tomb hard by. which is his indeed. The woman believes, and, being consoled by a Sign of Heaven, departs in peace. Across his breast one hundred times each day Saint Patrick drew the Venerable Sign, And sixty times by night: and whensoe'er In travel Cross was seen far off or nigh On lonely moor, or rock, or heathy hill, For Erin then was sown with Christian seed, He sought it, and before it knelt. Yet once, While cold in winter shone the star of eve Upon their board, thus spake a youthful monk: ‘Three times this day, my father, didst thou pass The Cross of Christ unmarked. At morn thou saw'st A last year's lamb that by it sheltered lay, At noon a dove that near it sat and mourned, At eve a little child that round it raced, Well pleased with each; yet saw'st thou not that Cross, Nor mad'st thou any reverence!’ At that word Wondering, the Saint arose, and left the meat, And, wondering, went to venerate that Cross. Dark was the earth and dank ere yet he reached That spot; and lo! where lamb had lain, and dove Had mourned, and child had raced, there stood indeed High-raised, the Cross of Christ. Before it long He prayed, and kneeling, marked that on a tomb That Cross was raised. Then, inly moved by God, The Saint demanded, ‘Who, of them that walked The sun-warmed earth lies here in darkness hid?’ And answer made a lamentable Voice: ‘Pagan I lived, my own soul's bane:—when dead, Men buried here my body.’ Patrick then: ‘How stands the Cross of Christ on Pagan grave?’ And answered thus the lamentable Voice: ‘A woman's work. She had been absent long; Her son had died: near mine his grave was made; Half blind was she through fleeting of her tears, And, erring, raised the Cross upon my tomb, Misdeeming it for his. Nightly she comes, Wailing as only Pagan mothers wail; So wailed my mother once, while pain tenfold Ran through my bodiless being. For her sake, If pity dwells on earth or highest heaven, May it this mourner comfort! Christian she, And capable of pity.’ Then the Saint Cried loud, ‘O God, Thou seest this Pagan's heart, That love within it dwells: therefore not his That doom of Souls all hate, and self-exiled To whom Thy Presence were a woe twice told. Eternal Pity! pity Thou Thy work;— Sole Peace of them that love Thee, grant him peace.’ Thus Patrick prayed; and in the heaven of heavens God heard His servant's prayer. Then Patrick mused: ‘Now know I why I passed that Cross unmarked; It was not that it seemed.’ As thus he knelt, Behold, upon the cold and bitter wind Rang wail on wail; and o'er the moor there moved What seemed a woman's if a human form. That miserable phantom onward came With cry succeeding cry that sank or swelled As dipped or rose the moor. Arrived at last, She heeded not the Saint, but on that grave Dashed herself down. Long time that woman wailed; And Patrick, long, for reverence of her woe Forbore. At last he spake low-toned as when Best listener knows not when the strain begins. ‘Daughter! the sparrow falls not to the ground Without his Maker. He that made thy son Hath sent His Son to bear all woes of men, And vanquish every foe—the latest, Death.’ Then rolled that woman on the Saint an eye As when the last survivor of a host Glares on some pitying conqueror. ‘Ho! the man That treads upon my grief! He ne'er had sons; And thou, O son of mine, hast left no sons, Though oft I said, “When I am old, his babes Shall climb my knees.” My boast was mine in youth; But now mine age is made a barren stock And as a blighted briar.’ In grief she turned; And as on blackening tarn gust follows gust, Again came wail on wail. On strode the night: The jagged forehead of that forest old Alone was seen: all else was gloom. At last With voice, though kind, upbraiding, Patrick spake: ‘Daughter, thy grief is wilful and it errs; Errs like those sad and tear-bewildered eyes That for a Christian's take a Pagan's grave, And for a son's a stranger's. Ah! poor child, Thy pride it was to raise, where lay thy son, A Cross, his memory's honour. By thee close All dewed and glimmering in yon rising moon, Low lies a grave unhonoured, and unknown: No cross stands on it; yet upon its breast Graved shalt thou find what Christian tomb ne'er lacks, The Cross of Christ. Woman, there lies thy son.’ She rose; she found that other tomb; she knelt; And o'er it went her wandering palms, as though Some stone-blind mother o'er an infant's face Should spread an agonising hand, intent To choose betwixt her own and counterfeit; She found that cross deep-grav'n, and further sign Close by, to her well known. One piercing shriek— Another moment, and her body lay Along that grave with kisses, and wild hands As when some forest beast tears up the ground, Seeking its prey there hidden. Then once more Rang the wild wail above that lonely heath, While roared far off the vast invisible woods, And with them strove the blast, in eddies dire Whirling both branch and bough. Through hurrying clouds The scared moon rushed like ship that naked glares One moment, lightning-lighted in the storm, Anon in wild waves drowned. An hour went by: Still wailed that woman, and the tempest roared; While in the heart of ruin Patrick prayed. He loved that woman. Unto Patrick dear, Dear as God's Church was still the single Soul, Dearest the suffering Soul. He gave her time; He let the floods of anguish spend themselves: But when her wail sank low; when woods were mute, And where the skiey madness late had raged Shone the blue heaven, he spake with voice in strength Gentle like that which calmed the Syrian lake: ‘My sister, God hath shown me of thy wound, And wherefore with the blind old Pagan's cry Hopeless thou mourn'st. Returned from far, thou found'st Thy son had Christian died, and saw'st the Cross On Christian graves: and ill thy heart endured That tomb so dear should lack its reverence meet. To him thou gav'st the Cross, albeit that Cross Inly thou know'st not yet. That knowledge thine, Thou hadst not left thy son amerced of prayer, And given him tears, not succour.’ ‘Yea,’ she said, ‘Of this new Faith I little understand, Being an aged woman and in woe: But since my son was Christian, such am I; And since the Christian tomb is decked with Cross He shall not lack his right.’ Then Patrick spake: ‘O woman, hearken, for through me thy son Invokes thee. All night long for thee, unknown, My hands have risen: but thou hast raised no prayer For him, thy dearest; nor from founts of God, Though brimful, hast thou drawn for lips that thirst. Arise, and kneel, and hear thy loved one's cry: Too long he waiteth. Blessed are the dead: They rest in God's high Will. But more than peace, The rapturous vision of the Face of God, Won by the Cross of Christ—for that they thirst As thou, if viewless stood thy son close by, Wouldst thirst to see his countenance. Eyes sin-scaled Not yet can see their God. Prayer speeds the time: The living help the dead; all praise to Him Who blends His children in a league of help, Making all good one good. Eternal Love! Not thine the will that love should cease with life, Or, living, cease from service, barren made, A stagnant gall eating the mourner's heart That hour when love should stretch a hand of might Up o'er the grave to heaven. O great in love, Perfect love's work: for well, sad heart, I know, Hadst thou not trained thy son in virtuous ways, Christian he ne'er had been.’ Those later words That solitary mourner understood, The earlier but in part, and answered thus: ‘A loftier Cross, and farther seen, shall rise Upon this grave new-found! No hireling hands— Mine own shall raise it; yea, though thirty years Should sweat beneath the task.’ And Patrick said: ‘What means the Cross? That lore thou lack'st now learn.’ Then that which Kings desired to know, and seers And prophets vigil-blind—that Crown of Truths, Scandal of fools, yet conqueror of the world, To her, that midnight mourner, he divulged, Record authentic: how in sorrow and sin The earth had groaned; how pity, like a sword, Had pierced the great Paternal Heart in heaven; How He, the Light of Light, and God of God, Had man become, and died upon the Cross, Vanquishing thus both sorrow and sin, and risen, The might of death o'erthrown; and how the gates Of heaven rolled inwards as the Anointed King Resurgent and ascending through them passed In triumph with His Holy Dead; and how The just, thenceforth death-freed, the self-same gates Entering, shall share the everlasting throne. Thus Patrick spake, and many a stately theme Rehearsed beside, higher than heaven, and yet Near as the farthest can alone be near. Then in that grief-worn creature's bosom old Contentions rose, and fiercer fires than burn In sultry breasts of youth: and all her past, Both good and evil, woke, in sleep long sealed; And all the powers and forces of her soul Rushed every way through darkness seeking light, Like winds or tides. Beside her Patrick prayed, And mightier than his preaching was his prayer, Sheltering that crisis dread. At last beneath The great Life-Giver's breath that Human Soul, An inner world vaster than planet worlds, In undulation swayed, as when of old The Spirit of God above the waters moved Creative, while the blind and shapeless void Yearned into form, and form grew meet for life, And downward through the abysses Law ran forth With touch soul-soft, and seas from lands retired, And light from dark, and wondering Nature passed Through storm to calm,and all things found their home. Silence long time endured; at last, clear-voiced Her head not turning, thus the woman spake: ‘That God who Man became—who died, and lives,— Say, died He for my son?’ And Patrick said, ‘Yea, for thy son He died. Kneel, woman, kneel! Nor doubt, for mighty is a mother's prayer, That He who in the eternal light is throned, Lifting the roseate and the nail-pierced palm, Will make in heaven the Venerable Sign, For He it is prays in us, and that Soul Thou lov'st pass on to glory.’ At his word She knelt, and unto God, with help of God, Uprushed the strength of prayer, as when the cloud Uprushes past some beetling mountain wall From billowy deeps unseen. Long time she prayed; While heaven and earth grew silent as that night When rose the Saviour. Sudden ceased the prayer: And rang upon the night her jubilant cry, ‘I saw a Sign in Heaven. Far inward rolled The gates; and glory flashed from God; and he I love his entrance won.’ Then, fair and tall, That woman stood with hands upraised to heaven, The dusky shadow of her youth renewed, And instant Patrick spake, ‘Give thanks to God, And speed thee home, and sleep; and since thy son No children left, take to thee orphans twain And rear them, in his honour, unto Christ; And yearly, when the death-day of thy son Returns, his birth-day name it; call thy friends; Give alms; and range the poor around thy door, So shall they feast, and pray. Woman, farewell: All night the dark upon thy face hath lain; Yet shall we know each other, met in heaven.’ Then blithe of foot that Mother crossed the moor; And when she reached her door a zone of white Loosening along a cloud that walled the east Revealed the coming dawn. That dawn ere long Lay, unawaking, on a face serene, On tearless lids, and quiet, open palms, On stormless couch and raiment calm that hid A breast if faded now, yet happier far Than when in prime its youthful wave first heaved Rocking a sleeping Infant. SAINT PATRICK AT THE FEAST OF KNOCK CAE; OR, THE FOUNDING OF MUNGRET. ARGUMENT. Saint Patrick, being bidden to a feast, discourses on the way against the pride of the Bards, for whom Fiacc pleads. Derball, a scoffer, requires the Saint to remove a mountain. He kneels down and prays, and Derball avers that the mountain moved. Notwithstanding, Derball believes not, but departs. The Saint declares that he saw not whether the mountain moved. He places Nessan over his convent at Mungret because he had given a little wether to the hungry. Nessan's mother grudged the gift; and Saint Patrick prophesies that her grave shall not be in her son's church. In Limneach, Limerick. The far-famed Monastery of Mungret was within three miles of Limerick. Now Limerick. ere he reached it, fame there ran Of Patrick's words and works. Before his feet Aileel had fallen, loud wailing, with his wife, And cried, ‘Our child is slain by savage beasts; But thou, O prophet, if that God thou serv'st Be God indeed, restore him!’ Patrick turned To Malach, praised of all men. ‘Brother, kneel, And raise you child.’ But Malach answered, ‘Nay, Lest, tempting God, His service I should shame.’ Then Patrick, ‘Answer of the base is thine; And base shall be that house thou builds't on earth, Little, and low. A man may fail in prayer: What then? Thank God! the fault is ours not His, And ours alone the shame.’ The Apostle turned To Ibar, and to Ailbè, bishops twain, And bade them raise the child. They heard and knelt: And Patrick knelt between them; and these three Upheaved a wondrous strength of prayer: and lo! All pale, yet shining, rose the child, and sat, Lifting small hands, and preached to those around, And straightway they believed, and were baptized. Thus with loud rumour all the land was full, And some believed; some doubted; and a chief, Lonan, the son of Eirc, that half believed, Willing to draw from Patrick wonder and sign, By messengers besought him, saying, ‘Come, For in thy reverence waits thy servant's feast Spread on Knock Cae.’ That pleasant hill ascends Westward of Ara, girt by rivers twain, Maigue, lily-lighted, and the ‘Morning Star’ Once ‘Samhair’ named, that eastward through the woods Winding, upon its rapids earliest meets The morn, and flings it far o'er mead and plain. From Limneach therefore Patrick, while the dawn, Still dusk, its joyous secret kept, went forth, O'er dustless road soon lost in dewy fields, And groves that, touched by wakening winds, began To load damp airs with scent. That time it was When beech leaves lose their silken gloss, and maids From whitest brows depose the hawthorn white, Red rose in turn enthroning. Earliest gleams Glimmered on leaves that shook like wings of birds: Saint Patrick marked them well. He turned to Fiacc— ‘God might have changed to Pentecostal tongues The leaves of all the forests in the world, And bade them sing His love! He wrought not thus: A little hint He gives us and no more. Alone the willing see. Thus they sin less Who, if they saw, seeing would disbelieve. Hark to that note! O foolish woodland choirs! Ye sing but idle loves; and, idler far, The bards sing war—war only!’ Answered thus The monk bard-loving: ‘Sing it! Ay, and make! The keys of all the tempests hang on zones Of those cloud-spirits! They, too, can “bind and loose:” A bard incensed hath proved a kingdom's doom! Such Aidan. Upon cakes of meal his host, King Aileach, fed him in a fireless hall: The bard complained not—ay, but issuing forth, Sang in dark wood a keen and venomed song That raised on the king's countenance plague-spots three; Who saw him named them Scorn, Dishonour, Shame, And blighted those three oak trees nigh his door. What next? Before a month that realm lay drowned In blood; and fire went o'er the opprobrious house!’ Thus spake the youth, and blushed at his own zeal For bardic fame: then added, ‘Strange the power Of song! My father, do I vainly dream Oft thinking that the bards, perchance the birds, Sing something vaster than they think or know? Some fire immortal lives within their strings: Therefore the people love them. War divine, God's war on sin—true love-song best and sweetest— Perforce they chaunt in spirit, not wars of clans: Yea, one day, conscious, they shall sing that song; One day by river clear of south or north, Pagan no more, the laurelled head shall rise, And chaunt the Warfare of the Realm of Souls, The anguish and the cleansing, last the crown— Prelude of songs celestial!’ Patrick smiled: ‘Still, as at first, a lover of the bards! Hard task was mine to win thee to the cowl! Dubtach, thy master, sole in Tara's hall Who made me reverence, mocked my quest. He said, “Fiacc thou wouldst?—my Fiacc? Few days gone by I sent the boy with poems to the kings; He loves me: hardly will he leave the songs To wear thy tonsure!” As he spake, behold, Thou enter'dst. Sudden hands on Dubtach's head I laid, as though to gird with tonsure crown: Then rose thy clamour, “Erin's chief of bards A tonsured man! Me, father, take, not him! Far less the loss to Erin and the Songs!” Down knelt'st thou; and, ere long, old Dubtach's floor Shone with thy vernal locks, like forest paths Made gold by leaves of autumn!’ As he spake, The sun, new-risen, flashed on a breast of wood That answered from a thousand jubilant throats: Then Fiacc, with all their music in his face, Resumed: ‘My father, upon Tara's steep Patient thou sat'st whole months, sifting with care The laws of Eire, recasting for all time, Ill laws from good dissevering, as that Day Shall sever tares from wheat. I see thee still, As then we saw—thy clenched hand lost in beard Propping thy chin; thy forehead wrinkle-trenched Above that wondrous tome, the “Senchus Mohr,” Like his, that Hebrew lawgiver's, who sat Throned on the clouded Mount, while far below The Tribes waited in awe. Now answer make! Three bishops, and three brehons, and three kings, Ye toiled—who helped thee best?’ ‘Dubtach, the bard,’ Patrick replied—‘Yea, wise was he, and knew Man's heart like his own strings.’ ‘All bards are wise,’ Shouted the youth, ‘except when war they wage On thee, the wisest. In their music bath They cleanse man's heart, not less, and thus prepare, Though hating thee, thy way. The bards are wise For all except themselves. Shall God not save them, He who would save the worst? Such grace were hard Unless, death past, their souls to birds might change, And in the darksomest grove of Paradise Lament, amerced, their error, yet rejoice In souls that walked obedient!’ ‘Darksomest grove,’ Patrick made answer; ‘darksome is their life; Darksome their pride, their love, their joys, their hopes; Darksome, though gleams of happier lore they have, Their light! Seest thou yon forest floor, and o'er it, The ivy's flash—earth-light? Such light is theirs: By such can no man walk.’ Thus, gay or grave, Conversed they, while the Brethren paced behind; Till now the morn crowded each cottage door With clustered heads. They reached ere long in woods A hamlet small. Here on the weedy thatch White fruit-bloom fell: through shadow, there, went round The swinging mill-wheel tagged with silver fringe; Here rang the mallet; there was heard remote The one note of the love-contented bird. Though warm the sun, in shade the young spring morn Was edged with winter yet, and icy film Glazed the deep ruts. The swarthy smith worked hard, And working sang; the wheelwright toiled close by; An armourer next to these: through flaming smoke Glared the fierce hands that on the anvil fell In thunder down. A sorcerer stood apart Kneading Death's messenger, that missile ball, The Lia Laimbhè. To his heart he clasped it, And o'er it muttered spells with flatteries mixed: ‘Hail, little daughter mine! 'Twixt hand and heart I knead thee! From the Red Sea came that sand Which, blent with viper's poison, makes thy flesh! Be thou no shadow wandering on the air! Rush through the battle gloom as red-combed snake Cleaves the blind waters! On! like Witch's glance, Or forkèd flash, or shaft of summer pest, And woe to him that meets thee! Mouth blood-red My daughter hath:—not healing be her kiss!’ Thus he. In shade he stood, and phrensy-fired; And yet he marked who watched him. Without word Him Patrick passed; but spake to all the rest With voice so kindly reverent, ‘Is not this,’ Men asked, ‘the preacher of the “Tidings Good?”’ ‘What tidings? Has he found a mine?’ ‘He speaks To princes as to brothers; to the hind As we to princes' children! Yea, when mute, Saith not his face “Rejoice”?’ At times the Saint Laid on the head of age his strong right hand, Gentle as touch of soft-accosting eyes; And once before an open door he stopped, Silent. Within, all glowing like a rose, A mother stood for pleasure of her babes That—in them still the warmth of couch late left— Around her gambolled. On his face, as hers, Their sport regarding, long time lay the smile; Then crept a shadow o'er it, and he spake In sadness: ‘Woman! when a hundred years Have passed, with opening flower and falling snow, Where then will be thy children?’ Like a cloud Fear and great wrath fell on her. From the wall She snatched a battle-axe and raised it high In both hands, clamouring, ‘Wouldst thou slay my babes?’ He answered, ‘I would save them. Woman, hear! Seest thou yon floating shape? It died a worm; It lives, the blue-winged angel of spring meads: Thy children, likewise, if they serve my King, Death past, shall find them wings.’ Then to her cheek The bloom returned, and splendour to her eye; And catching to her breast, that larger swelled, A child, she wept, ‘Oh, would that he might live For ever! Prophet, speak! thy words are good! Their father, too, must hear thee.’ Patrick said, ‘Not so; nor falls this seed on every road;’ Then added thus: ‘Yon child, by all the rest Cherished as though he were some infant God, Is none of thine.’ She answered, ‘None of ours; A great chief sent him here for fosterage.’ Then he: ‘All men on earth the children are Of One who keeps them here in fosterage: They see not yet His face; but He sees them, Yea, and decrees their seasons and their times: Like infants, they must learn Him first by touch, Through nature, and her gifts—by hearing next, The hearing of the ear, and that is Faith— By Vision last. Woman, these things are hard; But thou to Limneach come in three days' time, Likewise thy husband; there, by Sangul's Well, Now called Saint Patrick's Well, close to Limerick. Thou shalt know all.’ The Saint had reached ere long That festal mount. Thousands with bannered line Scaled it light-hearted. Never favourite lamb In ribands decked shone brighter than that hour The fair flank of Knock Cae. Heath-scented airs Lightened the clambering toil. At times the Saint Stayed on their course the crowds, and towards the Truth Drew them by parable, or record old, Oftener by question sage. Not all believed: Of such was Derball. Man of wealth and wit, Nor wise, nor warlike, toward the Saint he strode With bubble-seething brain, and head high tossed, And cried, ‘Great Seer! remove yon mountain blue, Cenn Abhrat, by thy prayer! That done, to thee Fealty I pledge.’ Saint Patrick knelt in prayer: Soon Derball cried, ‘The central ridge descends;— Southward, beyond it, Longa's lake shines out In sunlight flashing!’ At his word drew near The men of Erin. Derball homeward turned, Mocking: ‘Believe who will, believe not I! Me more imports it o'er my foodful fields To draw the Maigue's rich waters than to stare At moving hills.’ But certain of that throng, Light men, obsequious unto Derball's laugh, Questioned of Patrick if the mountain moved. He answered, ‘On the ground mine eyes were fixed; Nought saw I. Haply, through defect of mine, It moved not. Derball said the mountain moved; Yet kept he not his pledge, but disbelieved. “Faith can move mountains.” Never said my King That mountains moved could move reluctant faith In unbelieving heart.’ With sad, calm voice He spake; and Derball's laughter frustrate died. Meantime, high up on that thyme-scented hill By shadows swept, and lights, and rapturous winds, Lonan prepared the feast, and, with that chief, Mantan, a deacon. Tables fair were spread; And tents with branches gay. Beside those tents Stood the sweet-breathing, mournful, slow-eyed kine With hazel-shielded horns, and gave their milk Gravely to merry maidens. Low the sun Had fallen, when, Patrick near the summit now, There burst on him a wandering troop, wild-eyed, With scant and quaint array. O'er sunburnt brows They wore sere wreaths; their piebald vests were stained, And lean their looks, and sad: some piped, some sang, Some tossed the juggler's ball. ‘From far we came,’ They cried; ‘we faint with hunger; give us food!’ Upon them Patrick bent a pitying eye, And said, ‘Where Lonan and where Mantan toil Go ye, and pray them, for mine honour's sake, To gladden you with meat.’ But Lonan said, And Mantan, ‘Nay, but when the feast is o'er, The fragments shall be yours.’ With darkening brow The Saint of that denial heard, and cried, ‘He cometh from the North, even now he cometh, For whom the Blessing is reserved; he cometh Bearing a little wether at his back:’ And, straightway, through the thicket evening-dazed A shepherd—by him walked his mother—pushed, Bearing a little wether. Patrick said, ‘Give them to eat. They hunger.’ Gladly then That shepherd youth gave them the wether small: With both his hands outstretched, and liberal smile, He gave it, though, with angry eye askance His mother grudged it sore. The wether theirs, As though earth-swallowed, vanished that wild tribe, Fearing that mother's eye. Then Patrick spake To Lonan, ‘Zealous is thy service, friend; Yet of thy house no king shall sit on throne, No bishop bless the people.’ Turning then To Mantan, thus he spake, ‘Careful art thou Of many things; not less that church thou raisest Shall not be of the honoured in the land; And in its chancel waste the mountain kine Shall couch above thy grave.’ To Nessan last Thus spake he: ‘Thou that didst the hungry feed, The poor of Christ, that know not yet His name, And, helping them that cried to me for help, Cherish mine honour, like a palm one day Shall rise thy greatness.’ Nessan's mother old For pardon knelt. He blessed her hoary head, Yet added, mournful, ‘Not within the church That Nessan serves shall lie his mother's grave.’ Then Nessan he baptized, and on him bound Ere long the deacon's grade, and placed him, later, Priest o'er his church at Mungret. Centuries ten It stood, a convent round it as a star Forth sending beams of glory and of grace O'er woods Teutonic and the Tyrrhene Sea. Yet Nessan's mother in her son's great church Slept not; nor where the mass bell tinkled low: West of the church her grave, to his—her son's— Neighbouring, yet severed by the chancel wall. Thus from the morning star to evening star Went by that day. In Erin many such Saint Patrick lived using well pleased the chance Or great or small, since all things come from God: And well the people loved him, being one Who sat amid their marriage feasts, and saw, Where sin was not, in all things beauty and love. But, ere he passed from Munster, longing fell On Patrick's heart to view in all its breadth Her river-flood, and bless its western waves; Therefore, forth journeying, to that hill he went, Knock Patrick. Highest among the wave-girt, heathy hills, That still sustains his name, and saw the flood At widest stretched, and that green Isle Foynes Island. Foynes. hard by, And northern Thomond. From its coasts her sons Rushed countless forth in skiff and coracle Smiting blue wave to white, till Sheenan's sound The Shannon. Ceased, in their clamour lost. That hour from God Power fell on Patrick; and in spirit he saw, Invisible to flesh, the western coasts, And the ocean way, and, far beyond, that land The Future's heritage, and prophesied Of Brendan who ere long in wicker boat Should over-ride the mountains of the deep, Shielded by God, and tread—no fable then— Fabled Hesperia. Last of all he saw More near, thy hermit home, Senanus;—‘Hail, Isle of blue ocean and the river's mouth! Scattery. There were seven churches on this small island, of which considerable remains still exist. The People's Lamp, their Counsel's Head, is thine!’ That hour shone out through cloud the westering sun And paved the wave with fire: that hour not less Strong in his God, westward his face he set, Westward and north, and spread his arms abroad, And drew the blessing down, and flung it far: ‘A blessing on the warriors, and the clans, A blessing on high field, and golden vales, On sea-like plain and on the showery ridge, On river-ripple, cliff, and murmuring deep, On seaward peaks, harbours, and towns, and ports; A blessing on the sand beneath the ships: On all descend the Blessing!’ Thus he prayed, Great-hearted; and from all the populous hills And waters came the People's vast ‘Amen!’ SAINT PATRICK AND KING EOCHAID. ARGUMENT. King Eochaid submits himself to the Christian Law because Saint Patrick has delivered his son from bonds, yet only after making a pact that he is not, like the meaner sort, to be baptized. In this stubbornness he persists, though otherwise a kindly king; and after many years, he dies. Saint Patrick had refused to see his living face; yet after death he prays by the death-bed. Life returns to the dead; and sitting up, like one sore amazed, he demands baptism. The Saint baptizes him, and offers him a choice either to reign over all Erin for fifteen years, or to die. Eochaid chooses to die, and so departs. Eochaid, son of Crimther, reigned, a King Northward in Clochar. Now Clogher. Dearer to his heart Than kingdom or than people or than life Was he, the boy long wished for. Dear was she, Keinè, his daughter. Babyhood's white star, Beauteous in childhood, now in maiden dawn She witched the world with beauty. From her eyes A light went forth like morning o'er the sea; Sweeter her voice than wind on harp; her smile Could stay men's breath. With wingèd feet she trod The yearning earth that, if it could, like waves Had swelled to meet their pressure. Ah, the pang! Beauty, the immortal promise, like a cheat If unwed glides into the shadow land, Childless and twice defeated. Beauty wed To mate unworthy, suffers worse eclipse— ‘Ill choice between two ills!’ thus spleenful cried Eochaid; but not his the pensive grief: He would have kept his daughter in his house For ever; yet, since better might not be, Himself he chose her out a mate, and frowned, And said, ‘The dog must have her.’ But the maid Wished not for marriage. Tender was her heart; Yet though her twentieth year had o'er her flown, And though her tears had dewed a mother's grave, In her there lurked, not flower of womanhood, But flower of angel texture. All around To her was love. The crown of earthly love Seemed but its crown of mockery. Love Divine— For that she yearned, and yet she knew it not; Knew less that love she feared. She walked in woods While all the green leaves, drenched by sunset's gold, Upon a shower-bespangled sycamore Shivered, and birds among them choir on choir Chanted her praise—or spring's. ‘Ill sung,’ she laughed, ‘My dainty minstrels! Grant to me your wings, And I for them will teach you song of mine: Listen!’ A carol from her lip there gushed That, ere its time, might well have called the spring From winter's coldest cave. It ceased; she turned. Beside her Patrick stood. His hand he raised To bless her. Awed, though glad, upon her knees The maiden sank. His eye, as if through air, Saw through that stainless soul, and, crystal-shrined Therein, its inmate, Truth. That other Truth Instant to her he preached—the Truth Divine— (For whence is caution needful, save from sin?) And those two Truths, each gazing upon each, Embraced like sisters, thenceforth one. For her No arduous thing was Faith, ere yet she heard In heart believing: and, as when a babe Marks some bright shape, if near or far it knows not, And stretches forth a witless hand to clasp Phantom or form, even so with wild surmise And guesses erring first, and questions apt, She chased the flying light, and round it closed At last, and found it substance. ‘This is He,’ Then cried she, ‘This, whom every maid should love, Conqueror self-sacrificed of sin and death: How shall we find, how please Him, how be nigh?’ Patrick made answer: ‘They that do His will Are nigh Him.’ And the virgin: ‘Of the nigh, Say, who is nighest?’ Thus, that wingèd heart Rushed to its rest. He answered: ‘Nighest they Who offer most to Him in sacrifice, As when the wedded leaves her father's house And cleaveth to her husband. Nighest they Who neither father's house nor husband's house Desire, but live with Him in endless prayer, And tend Him in His poor.’ Aloud she cried, ‘The nearest to the Highest, that is love;— I choose that bridal lot!’ He answered, ‘Child, The choice is God's. For each, that lot is best To which He calls us.’ Lifting then pure hands, Thus wept the maiden: ‘Call me, Virgin-born! Will not the Mother-Maid permit a maid To sit beside those nail-pierced feet, and wipe, With hair untouched by wreaths of mortal love, The dolorous blood-stains from them? Stranger guest, Come to my father's tower! Against my will, Against his own, in bridal bonds he binds me: My suit he might resist: he cannot thine!’ She spake; and by her Patrick paced with feet To hers accordant. Soon they reached that fort: Central within a circling rath earth-built It stood; the western tower of stone; the rest, Not high, but spreading wide, of wood compact; For thither many a forest hill had sent His wind-swept daughter brood, relinquishing Converse with cloud and beam and rain forever To echo back the revels of a Prince. Mosaic was the work, beam laced with beam In quaint device: high up, o'er many a door Shone blazon rich of vermeil, or of green, Or shield of bronze, glittering with veinéd boss, Chalcedony or agate, or whate'er The wave-lipped marge of Neagh's broad lake might boast, Or ocean's shore, northward from Brandon's Head To where the myriad-pillared cliffs hang forth Their stony organs o'er the lonely main, And trembles yet the pilgrim, noting at eve The pride Fomorian, and that Giant Way The Giant's Causeway. Trending toward eastern Alba. From his throne Above the semicirque of grassy seats Whereon by Brehons and by Ollambs girt Daily he judged his people, rose the king And bade the stranger welcome. Day to day And night to night succeeded. In fit time, For Patrick, sometimes sudden, oft was slow, He spake his Master's message. At the close, As though in trance, the warriors circling stood With hands outstretched; the Druids downward frowned, Silent; and like a strong man awed for once, Eochaid round him stared. A little while, And from him passed the amazement. Buoyant once more, And bright like trees fresher for thunder-shower, With all his wonted aspect, bold and keen, He answered: ‘O my prophet, words, words, words! We too have Prophets. Better thrice our Bards; Yet, being no better these than trumpet's blast, The trumpet more I prize. Had words been work, Myself in youth had led the loud-voiced clan! Deeds I preferred. What profit e'er had I From windy marvels? Once with me in war A seer there camped that, bending back his head, Fit rites performed, and upward gazing, blew With rounded lips into the heaven of heavens Druidic breath. That heaven was changed to cloud, Cloud that on borne to Clairè's hated bound Down fell, a rain of blood! To me what gain? Within three weeks my son was trapped and snared By Aodh of Hy Brinin, king whose hosts Number my warriors fourfold. Three long years Beyond those purple mountains in the west Hostage he lies.’ Lightly Eochaid spake, And turned: but shaken chin betrayed that grief Which lived beneath his lightness. Sudden thronged High on the neighbouring hills a jubilant troop, Their banners waving, while the midway vale With harp and horn resounded. Patrick spake: ‘Rejoice! thy son returns! not sole he comes, But in his hand a princess, fair and good, A kingdom for her dowry. Aodh's realm, By me late left, welcomed my King with joy: All fire the mountains shone. “The God I serve,” Thus spake I, Aodh pointing to those fires, “In mountains of rejoicing hath no joy While sad beyond them sits a childless man, His only son thy captive. Captive groaned Creation; Bethlehem's Babe set free the slave. For His sake loose thy thrall!” A sweeter voice Pleaded with mine, his daughter's 'mid her tears. “Aodh,” I said, “these two each other love! What think'st thou? He who shaped the linnet's nest, Indifferent unto Him are human loves? Arise! thy work make perfect! Righteous deeds Are easier whole than half.” In thought awhile Old Aodh sat; then to his daughter turned, And thus, imperious even in kindness, spake: “Well fought the youth ere captured, like the son Of kings, and worthy to be sire of kings: Wed him this hour: and in three days, at eve, Restore him to his father!” King, this hour Thou know'st if Christ's strong Faith be empty words, Or truth, and armed with power.’ That night was passed In feasting and in revel, high and low Rich with a common gladness. Many a torch Flared in the hand of servitors hill-sent, That standing, each behind a guest, retained Beneath that roof clouded by banquet steam Their mountain wildness. Here, the splendour glanced On goblet jewel-chased and dark with wine, Swift circling; there, on walls with antlers spread, And rich with yew-wood carvings, flower or bud, Or clustered grape pendent in russet gleam As though from nature's hand. A hall hard by Echoed the harp that now nor kindled rage, Nor grief condoled, nor sealed with slumber's balm Tempestuous spirits, triumphs three of song, But raised to rapture, mirth. Far shone that hall Glowing with hangings steeped in every tinct The boast of Erin's dyeing-vats, now plain, Now pranked with bird or beast or fish, whate'er Fast-flying shuttle from the craftsman's thought Catching, on bore through glimmering warp and woof. A marvellous work; now traced by broiderer's hand With legends of Ferdìadh and of Meave, Even to the golden fringe. The warriors paced Exulting. Oft they showed their merit's prize, Poniard or cup, tribute ordained of tribes From age to age, Eochaid's right, on them With equal right devolving. Slow they moved In mantle now of crimson, now of blue, Clasped with huge torque of silver or of gold Just where across the snowy shirt there strayed Tendril of purple thread. With jewelled fronts Beauteous in pride 'mid light of winsome smiles, Over the rushes green with slender foot In silver slipper hid, the ladies passed, Answering with eyes not lips the whispered praise, Or loud the bride extolling—‘When was seen Such sweetness and such grace?’ Meantime the king Conversed with Patrick. Vexed he heard announced His daughter's high resolve: but still his looks Went wandering to his son. ‘My boy! Behold him! His valour and his gifts are all from me: My first-born!’ From the dancing throng apart His daughter stood the while, serene and pale, Down-gazing on that lily in her hand With face of one who notes not shapes around, But dreams some happy dream. The king drew nigh, And on her golden head the sceptre staff Leaning, but not to hurt her, thus began: ‘Your prophets of the day, I trust them not! If sent from God, why came they not long since? Our Druids came before them, and, belike, Shall after them abide! With these new seers I count not Patrick. Things that Patrick says I ofttimes thought. His lineage too is old— Wide-browed, grey-eyed, with downward lessening face, Not like your baser breeds, with questing eyes And jaw of dog. But for thy Heavenly Spouse, I like not Him! At least, wed Cormac first! If rude his ways, yet noble is his name, And being but poor the man will bide with me: He's brave, and likeliest soon in fight may fall! When Cormac dies, wed next—’ a music clash Forth bursting drowned his words. Three days passed by: To Patrick, then preparing to depart, Thus spake Eochaid in the ears of all: ‘Herald Heaven-missioned of the Tidings Good! Those tidings I have pondered. They are true: I for that truth's sake, and in honour bound By reason of my son set free, resolve The same, upon conditions, to believe, And suffer all my people to believe, Just terms exacted. Briefly these they are: First, after death, I claim admittance frank Into thy Heavenly Kingdom: next, till death For me exemption from that Baptism Rite, Imposed on kerne and hind. Experience-taught, I love not rigid bond and written pledge: 'Tis well to brand your mark on sheep or lamb: Kings are of lion breed; and of my house 'Tis known there never yet was king baptized. This pact concluded, preach within my realm Thy Faith; and wed my daughter to thy God. Not scholarly am I to know what joy A maid can find in psalm, and cell, and spouse Unseen: yet ever thus my sentence stood, “Choose each his way.” My son restored, her loss To me is loss the less.’ Thus spake the king. Then Patrick, on whose face the princess bent The supplication softly strong of eyes Like planets seen through mist, Eochaid's heart Knowing, which miracle had hardened more, Made answer, ‘King, a man of jests art thou, Claiming free range in heaven, and yet its gate Thyself close barring! In thy daughter's prayers Belike thou trustest, that where others creep Thou shalt its golden bastions over-fly. Far otherwise than in that way thou weet'st, That daughter's prayers shall speed thee. With thy word I close, that word to frustrate. God be with thee! Thou living, I return not. Fare thee well.’ Thus speaking, by the hand he took the maid, And led her through the concourse. At her feet The poor fell low, kissing her garment's hem, And many brought their gifts, and all their prayers, And old men wept. A maiden train snow-garbed, Her steps attending, whitened plain and field, As when at times dark glebe, new-turned, is changed To white by flock of ocean birds alit, Or inland blown by storm, or hunger-urged To filch the late-sown grain. Her convent home Ere long received her. There Ethembria ruled, Green Erin's earliest nun. Of princely race, She in past years before the font of Christ Had knelt at Patrick's feet. Once more she sought him: Over the lovely, lovelier change had passed, As when on childish girlhood, 'mid a shower Of lilies earthward wafted, maidenhood In peacefuller state assumes her spotless throne; So, from that maiden, vestal now had risen:— Lowlier she seemed, more tender, soft, and grave, Yet loftier; hushed in quiet more divine, Yet wonder-awed. Again she knelt, and o'er The bending queenly head, till then unbent, He flung that veil which woman bars from man To make her more than woman. Nigh to death The Saint forgat not her. With her remained Keinè; but Patrick dwelt far off at Saul. Years came and went: yet neither chance nor change, Nor war, nor peace, nor warnings from the priests, Nor whispers 'mid the omen-mongering crowd, Might from Eochaid charm his wayward will, Nor reasonings of the wise that still preferred Safe port to victory's pride. He reasoned too, For confident in his reasonings was the king, Reckoning on pointed fingers every link That clenched his mail of proof. ‘On Patrick's word Ye tell me Baptism is the gate of Heaven: Attend, Sirs! I have Patrick's word no less That I shall enter Heaven. What need I more? If Death, truth-speaker, shows that Patrick lied, Plain is my right against him! Heaven not won, Patrick bare hence my daughter through a fraud: He must restore her fourfold—daughters four, As fair and good. If not, the prophet's pledge For honour's sake his Master must redeem, And unbaptized receive me. Dupes are ye! Doomed 'mid the common flock, with branded fleece Bleating to enter Heaven!’ The years went by; And weakness came. No more his small light form To reverent eyes seemed taller than it was: No more the shepherd watched him from the hill Heading his hounds, and hoped to catch his smile, Yet feared his questions keen. The end drew near. Some wept, some railed; restless the warriors tramped; The Druids conned their late discountenanced spells: The bard his lying harpstrings spurned, so long Healing, unhelpful now. But far away, Within that lonely convent tower from her Who prayed for ever, mightier rose the prayer. Within the palace, now by usage old To all flung open, all were sore amazed, All save the king. The leech beside the bed Sobbed where he stood, yet sware, ‘The fit will pass: Ten years the King may live.’ Eochaid frowned: ‘Shall I, to patch thy fame, live ten years more, My death-time come? My seventy years are sped: My sire and grandsire died at sixty-nine. Like Aodh, shall I lengthen out my days Toothless, nor fit to vindicate my clan, Some losel's song? The kingdom is my son's Strike from my little milk-white horse the shoes, And loose him where the freshets make the mead Greenest in springtide. He must die ere long; And not to him did Patrick open Heaven. Praise be to Patrick's God! May He my sins, Known and unknown, forgive!’ Backward he sank Upon his bed, and lay with eyes half closed, Murmuring at times one prayer, five words or six; And twice or thrice he spake of trivial things; Then like an infant slumbered till the sun Sinking beneath a great cloud's fiery skirt Smote his old eyelids. Waking, in his ears The ripening cornfields whispered 'neath the breeze, For wide were all the casements that the soul By death delivered hindrance none might find (Careful of this the king); and thus he spake: ‘Nought ever raised my heart to God like fields Of harvest, waving wide from hill to hill, All bread-full for my people. Hale me forth: When I have looked once more upon that sight My blessing I will give them, and depart.’ Then in the fields they laid him, and he spake: ‘May He that to my people sends the bread, Send grace to all who eat it!’ With that word His hands down-falling, back once more he sank, And lay as dead; yet, sudden, rising not, Nor moving, nor his eyes unclosing, said, ‘My body in the tomb of ancient kings Inter not till beside it Patrick stands And looks upon my brow.’ He spake, then sighed A little sigh, and died. Three days, as when Black thunder cloud clings fast to mountain brows, So to the nation clung the grief: three days The lamentation sounded on the hills And rang around the pale blue meres, and rose Shrill from the bleeding heart of vale and glen, And rocky isle, and ocean's moaning shore; While by the bier the yellow tapers stood, And on the right side knelt Eochaid's son, Behind him all the chieftains cloaked in black; And on his left his daughter knelt, the nun, Behind her all her sisterhood, white-veiled, Like tombstones after snowstorm. Far away, At ‘Saul of Patrick,’ dwelt the Saint when first The king had sickened. Message sent he none Though knowing all; and when the end was nigh, And heralds now besought him day by day, He made no answer till o'er eastern seas Advanced the third fair morning. Then he rose, And took the Staff of Jesus, and at eve Beside the dead king standing, on his brow Fixed a sad eye. Aloud the people wept; The kneeling warriors eyed their lord askance; The nuns intoned their hymn. Above that hymn A cry rang out: it was the daughter's prayer; And after that was silence. By the dead Still stood the Saint, nor e'er removed his gaze. Then—seen of all—behold, the dead king's hands Rose slowly, as the weed on wave upheaved Without its will; and all the strengthless shape In cerements wrapped, as though by mastering voice From the white void evoked and realm of death, Without its will, a gradual bulk half rose, The hoar head gazing forth. Upon the face Had passed a change, the greatest earth may know; For what the majesty of death began The majesties of worlds unseen, and life Resurgent ere its time, had perfected, All accidents of flesh and sorrowful years Cancelled and quelled. Yet horror from his eyes Looked out as though some vision once endured Must cling to them for ever. Patrick spake: ‘Soul from the dead sent back once more to earth, What seek'st thou from God's Church?’ He answer made, ‘Baptism.’ Then Patrick o'er him poured the might Of healing waters in the Name Triune, The Father, and the Son, and Holy Spirit; And from his eyes the horror passed, and light Went from them, as the light of eyes that rest On the everlasting glory, while he spake: ‘Tempest of darkness drave me past the gates Celestial, and, a moment's space, within I heard the hymning of the hosts of God That feed for ever on the Bread of Life As feed the nations on the harvest wheat. Tempest of darkness drave me to the gates Of Anguish: then a cry came up from earth, Cry like my daughter's when her mother died, That stayed the on-rushing whirlwind; yet mine eyes Perforce looked in, and, many a thousand years, Branded upon them lay that woful sight Now washed from them for ever.’ Patrick spake: ‘This day a twofold choice I give thee, son; For fifteen years the rule o'er Erin's land, Rule absolute, Ard-Righ o'er lesser kings; Or instant else to die, and hear once more That hymn celestial, and that Vision see They see who sing that anthem.’ Light from God Over that late dead countenance streamed amain, Like to his daughter's now—more beauteous thrice— Yet awful, more than beauteous. ‘Rule o'er earth, Rule without end, were nought to that great hymn Heard but a single moment. I would die.’ Then Patrick, on him gazing, answered, ‘Die!’ And died the king once more, and no man wept; But on her childless breast the nun sustained Softly her father's head. That night discourse Through hall and court circled in whispers low. First one, ‘Was that indeed our king? But where The sword-scar and the wrinkles?’ ‘Where,’ rejoined, Wide-eyed, the next, ‘his little cranks and girds, The wisdom, and the whim?’ Then Patrick spake: ‘Sirs, till this day ye never saw your king; The man ye doted on was but his mask, His picture—yea, his phantom. Ye have seen At last the man himself.’ That night nigh sped, While slowly o'er the darkling woods went down, Warned by the cold breath of the up-creeping morn Invisible yet nigh, the August moon, Two vestals, gliding past like moonlight gleams, Conversed: one said, ‘His daughter's prayer prevailed!’ The second, ‘Who may know the ways of God? For this, may many a heart one day rejoice In hope! For this, the gift to many a man Exceed the promise; Faith's invisible germ Quickened with parting breath; and Baptism given, It may be, by an angel's hand unseen!’ SAINT PATRICK AND THE FOUNDING OF ARMAGH CATHEDRAL. ARGUMENT. Saint Patrick repairs to Ardmacha, there to found the chief church of Erin. For that purpose he demands of Dairè, the king, a certain woody hill. The king refuses it, and afterwards treats him with alternate scorn and reverence; while the Saint, in each event alike, makes the same answer, ‘Deo Gratias.’ At last the king concedes to him the hill; and on the summit of it Saint Patrick finds a little white fawn asleep. The men of Erin would have slain that fawn; but the Saint carries it on his shoulder, and restores it to its dam. Where the fawn lay, he places the altar of his cathedral. At Cluain Cain, in Ross, Carrickmacross in the south of the county Monaghan. unbent yet old, Dwelt Patrick long. Its sweet and flowery sward He to the rock had delved, with fixed resolve To build thereon Christ's chiefest church in Eire. Then by him stood God's angel, speaking thus: ‘Not here, but northward.’ He replied, ‘O, would This spot might favour find with God! Behold! Fair is it, and as meet to clasp a church As is a true heart in a virgin breast To clasp the Faith of Christ. The hinds around Name it “the beauteous meadow.”’ ‘Fair it is,’ The angel answered, ‘nor shall lack its crown. Another's is its beauty. Here, one day A pilgrim from the Britons sent shall build, And, later, what he builds shall pass to thine; But thou to Macha get thee.’ Patrick then, Obedient as that Patriarch Sire who faced At God's command the desert, northward went In holy silence. Soon to him was lost That green and purple meadow-sea, embayed 'Twixt two descending woody promontories, Its outlet girt with isles of rock, its shores Cream-white with meadow-sweet. Not once he turned, Climbing the uplands rough, or crossing streams Swoll'n by the melted snows. The Brethren paced Behind; Benignus first, his psalmist; next Secknall, his bishop; next his brehon Erc; Mochta, his priest; and Sinell of the Bells; Rodan, his shepherd; Essa, Bite, and Tassach, Workers of might in iron and in stone, God-taught to build the churches of the Faith With wisdom and with heart-delighting craft; Mac Cairthen last, the giant meek that oft On shoulders broad bare Patrick through the floods: His rest was nigh. That hour they crossed a stream; 'Twas deep, and 'neath his load, the giant sighed. Saint Patrick said, ‘Thou wert not wont to sigh!’ He answered, ‘Old I grow. Of them my mates How many hast thou left in churches housed Wherein they rule and rest!’ The Saint replied, ‘Thee also will I leave within a church For rule and rest; not to mine own too near, For rarely then should we be seen apart, Nor yet remote, lest we should meet no more.’ At Clochar soon he placed him. There, long years Mac Cairthen sat, its bishop. As they went, Oft through the woodlands rang the battle-shout; And twice there rose above the distant hill The smoke of hamlet fired. Yet, none the less, Spring-touched, the blackbird sang; the cowslip changed Green lawn to green and golden; and grey rock And river's marge with primroses were starred; Here shook the windflower; there the blue-bells gleamed, As though a patch of sky had fallen on earth. Then to Benignus spake the Saint: ‘My son, If grief were lawful in a world redeemed The blood-stains on a land so strong in faith, So slack in love, might cloud the holiest brow, Yea, his whose head lay on the breast of Christ. Clan wars with clan: no injury is forgiven; Like to the joy in stag-hunts is the war: Alas! for such what hope!’ Benignus answered, ‘O Father, cease not for this race to hope, Lest they should hope no longer! Hope they have; Still say they, “God will snare us in the end Though wild.”’ And Patrick, ‘Spirits twain are theirs: The stranger, and the poor, at every door They meet, and bid him in. The youngest child Officious is in service; maids prepare The bath; men brim the wine-cup. Then, forth borne, Cities they fire and rich in spoil depart, Greed mixed with rage—an industry of blood!’ He spake, and thus the younger made reply: ‘Father, the stranger is the brother-man To them; the poor is neighbour. Septs remote To them are alien worlds. They know not yet That rival clans are men.’ ‘That know they shall,’ Patrick made answer, ‘when a race far off Tramples their race to clay! God sends abroad His plague of war that men on earth may know Brother from foe, and anguish work remorse.’ He spake, and after musings added thus: ‘Base of God's kingdom is Humility— I have not spared to thunder o'er their pride; Great kings have I rebuked and signs sent forth, And banned for their sake fruitful plain, and bay; Yet still the widow's cry is on the air, The orphan's wail!’ Benignus answered mild, ‘O Father, not alone with sign and ban Hast thou rebuked their madness. Oftener far Thy sweetness hath reproved them. Once in woods Northward of Tara as we tracked our way Round us there gathered slaves who felled the pines For ship-masts. Scarred their hands, and red with blood, Because their master, Trian, thus had sworn, “Let no man sharpen axe!” Upon those hands Gazing, they wept soon as thy voice they heard, Because that voice was soft. Thou heard'st their tale; Straight to that chieftain's castle went'st thou up, And bound'st him with thy fast, beside his gate Sitting in silence till his heart should melt; And since he willed it not to melt, he died. Then, in her arms two babes, came forth the queen Black-robed, and freed her slaves, and gave them hire; And, we returning after many years, Filled was that wood with homesteads; plots of corn Rustled around them; here were orchards; there In trench or tank they steeped the bright blue flax; The saw-mill turned to use the wanton brook; Murmured the bee-hive; murmured household wheel; Soft eyes looked o'er it through the dusk; at work The labourers carolled; matrons glad and maids Bare us the pail head-steadied, children flowers: Last, from her castle paced the queen, and led In either hand her sons whom thou hadst blest, Thenceforth to stand thy priests. The land believed; And not through ban, or word, sharp-edged or soft, But silence and thy fast the ill custom died.’ He answered, ‘Christ, in Christian life expressed, This, this, not words, subdues a land to Christ; And in this best Apostolate all have part. Ah me! that flower thou hold'st is strong to preach Creative Love, because itself is lovely; But we, the heralds of Redeeming Love, Because we are unlovely in our lives, Preach to deaf ears! Yet theirs, theirs too, the sin.’ Benignus made reply: ‘The race is old; Not less their hearts are young. Have patience with them! For see, in spring the grave old oaks push forth Impatient sprays, wine-red: their strength matured, These sober down to verdure.’ Patrick paused, Then, brooding, spake, as one who thinks, not speaks: ‘A priest there walked with me ten years and more; Warrior in youth was he. One day we heard The shock of warring clans—I hear it still: Within him, as in darkening vase you note The ascending wine, I watched the passion mount:— Sudden he dashed him down into the fight, Nor e'er to Christ returned.’ Benignus answered: ‘I saw above a dusty forest roof The glad spring run, leaving a track sea-green: Not straight she ran; and yet she reached her goal: Later I saw above green copse of thorn The glad spring run, leaving a track foam-white: Not straight she ran; yet soon she conquered all! O Father, is it sinful to be glad Here amid sin and sorrow? Joy is strong, Strongest in spring-tide! Mourners I have known That, homeward wending from the new-dug grave, Against their will, where sang the happy birds Have felt the aggressive gladness stir their hearts, And smiled amid their tears.’ So babbled he, Shamed at his spring-tide raptures. As they went, Far on their left there stretched a mighty land Of forest-girdled hills, mother of streams: Beyond it sank the day; while round the west Like giants thronged the great cloud-phantoms towered. Advancing, din they heard, and found in woods A hamlet and a field by war unscathed, And boys on all sides running. Placid sat The village Elders; neither lacked that hour The harp that gently tranquillises age, Yet wakes young hearts with musical unrest, Forerunner oft of love's unrest. Ere long The measure changed to livelier: maid with maid Danced 'mid the dancing shadows of the trees, And youth with youth; till now, the strangers near, Those Elders welcomed them with act benign; And soon was slain the fatted kid, and soon The lamb; nor any asked till hunger's rage Was quelled, ‘Who art thou?’ Patrick made reply, ‘A Priest of God.’ Then prayed they, ‘Offer thou To Him our sacrifice! Belike 'tis He Who saves from war this hamlet hid in woods: Unblest be he who finds it!’ Thus they spake, The matrons, not the youths. In friendly talk The hours went by with laughter winged and tale; But when the moon, on rolling through the heavens, Showered through the leaves a dew of sprinkled light O'er the dark ground, the maidens garments brought Woven in their quiet homes when nights were long, Red cloak and kirtle green, and laid them soft, Still with the wearers' blameless beauty warm, For coverlet upon the warm dry grass, Honouring the stranger guests. For these they deemed Their low-roofed cots too mean. Glad-hearted rose The Christian hymn, not timid: far it rang Above the woods. Ere long, their blissful rites Fulfilled, the wanderers laid them down and slept. At midnight by the side of Patrick stood Victor, God's Angel, saying, ‘Lo! thy work Hath favour found and thou ere long shalt die: Thus therefore saith the Lord, “So long as sea Girdeth this isle, so long thy name shall hang In splendour o'er it, like the stars of God.”’ Then Patrick said, ‘A boon! I crave a boon!’ The angel answered, ‘Speak;’ and Patrick said, ‘Let them that with me toiled, or in the years To come shall toil, building o'er all this land The Fortress-Temple and great House of Christ, Equalled with me my name in Erin share.’ And Victor answered, ‘Half thy prayer is thine; With thee shall they partake. Not less, thy name Higher than theirs shall rise, and wider spread, Since thus more plainly shall His glory shine Whose glory is His justice.’ With the morn Those pilgrims rose, and, prime entoned and lauds, Poured out their blessing on that woodland clan Which, round them pressing, kissed them, robe and knee; Then on they journeyed till at set of sun Shone out the roofs of Macha, and that tower Where Dairè dwelt, its lord. Saint Patrick sent To Dairè embassage, vouchsafing prayer As sire might pray of son; ‘Give thou yon hill To Christ, that we may build His church thereon.’ And Dairè answered with a brow of storms Bent forward darkly, and long, sneering lips, ‘Your master is a mighty man, we know. Garban, that lied to God, he slew through prayer, And banned full many a lake, and many a plain, For trespass there committed! Let it be! A Chief of souls he is! No signs we work, Rulers earth-born: yet somewhat are we here— Depart! By others answer we will send.’ So Dairè sent to Patrick men of might, Fierce men, the battle's nurslings. Thus they spake: ‘High region for high heads! If build ye must, Build on the plain: the hill is Dairè's. Hence! Church site he grants you, and the field around.’ And Patrick, glancing from his Office Book, Made answer, ‘Deo Gratias,’ and no more. Upon that plain he built a little church Ere long, a convent likewise, girt with mound Banked from the meadow loam, and deftly set With stone, and fence, and woody palisade, That neither warring clans, far heard by day, Might hurt his cloistered charge, nor wolves by night, Howling in woods; and there he served the Lord. But Dairè scorned the Saint, and grudged his gift, Though small; and half in spleen, and half in greed, Sent down two stately coursers all night long To graze the deep sweet pasture round the church: Ill deed:—and so, for guerdon of that sin, Dead lay the coursers twain at the break of dawn. Then fled the servants back, and told their lord, Fearing for negligence rebuke and scath, ‘Thy Christian slew the coursers!’ and the king Gave word to slay or bind him. But from God A sickness fell on Dairè nigh to death That day and night. When morning brake, the queen, A woman leal with kind barbaric heart, Her bosom from the sick man's head withdrew A moment while he slept; and, round her gazing, Closed with both hands upon a liegeman's arm, And sped him to the Saint for pardon and peace. Then Patrick, dipping in the inviolate fount A chalice, blessed the water, with command ‘Sprinkle the stately coursers and the king;’ And straightway as from death the king arose, And rose from death the coursers. Dairè then, His tall frame boastful with that life renewed, Took with him men, and down the stone-paved hill Rode from his tower, and through the woodlands green, And bare with him an offering of those days, A brazen cauldron vast. Embossed it shone With sculptured shapes. On one side hunters rode: Low stretched their steeds: the dogs pulled down the stag Unseen, except the branching horns that rose Like hands in protest. Feasters, on the other, Raised high the cup pledging the safe return. This offering Dairè brought, and, entering, spake: ‘A gift for guerdon and for grace, O Priest!’ And Patrick, upward glancing from his book, Made answer, ‘Deo Gratias!’ and no more. King Dairè, homeward riding with knit brow Muttered, ‘Churl's welcome for a kingly boon!’ And, drinking late that night the stormy breath Of others' anger blent with his, commanded, ‘Ride forth at morn and bring me back my gift! Spurn it he shall not, though he prize it not.’ They heard him, and obeyed. At noon the king Demanded thus, ‘What answer made the Saint?’ They said, ‘His eyes he raised not from his book, But answered, “Deo Gratias!” and no more.’ Then Dairè stamped his foot, like war-horse stung By gadfly: musing next, and mute he sat A space, and lastly roared great laughter peals Till roared in mockery back the raftered roof, And clashed his hands together shouting thus: ‘A gift, and “Deo Gratias!”—gift withdrawn, And “Deo Gratias!” Sooth, the word is good! Madman is this, or man of God? We'll know!’ So from his frowning fortress once again Adown the resonant road o'er street and bridge Rode Dairè, at his right the queen in fear, With dumbly pleading countenance; close behind, With tangled locks and loose-hung battle-axe Ran the wild kerne; and loud the bull-horn blew. The convent reached, King Dairè from his horse Flung his great limbs, and at the doorway towered In gazing stern: the queen beside him stood, Her lustrous violet eyes all lost in tears: One hand on Dairè's garment lay like light Wandering on dusky ripple; one, upraised, Held in the high-necked horse that champed the bit, His head near hers. Within, the man of God, Sole-sitting, read his office book unmoved, And ending fixed his keen eye on the king, Not rising from his seat. Then fell from God Insight on Dairè, and aloud he cried, ‘A kingly man, of mind unmovable Art thou; and as the rock beneath my tower Shakes not in storm so shakes not heart of thine: Such men are of the height and not the plain: Therefore that hill to thee I grant unsought Which whilome I refused. Possession take This day, lest hostile demon warp my mood; And build thereon thy church. The same shall stand Strong mother-church of all thy great clan Christ!’ Thus Dairè spake ; and Patrick, at his word Rising, gave thanks to God, and to the king High blessing heard in heaven; and making sign Went forth, attended by his priestly train, Benignus first, his dearest, then the rest. In circuit thrice they girt that hill, and sang Anthem first heard when unto God was vowed That House which David offered in his heart, His son in act, and hymn of holy Church Hailing that City like a bride attired, From heaven to earth descending. With them sang An angel choir above them borne. The birds Forbore their songs, listening that angel strain, Ethereal music and by men unheard Except the Elect. The king in reverence paced Behind, his liegemen next, a mass confused With saffron standard gay and spears upheld Flashing through thickets green. These kept not line, For Alp was still recounting battles old, Aodh of wizards sang, and Ir of love; While bald-pate Conan, sharpening from his eye The sneering light, shot from his plastic mouth Shrill taunt and biting gibe. The younger sort Eyed the dense copse and launched full many a shaft Through it at flying beast. From ledge to ledge Clomb Angus, keen of sight, with hand o'er brow, Forth gazing on some far blue ridge of war With nostril wide outblown, and snorting cried, ‘Would I were there!’ Meantime, the man of God Had reached the fair crown of that sacred hill, A circle girt with woodland branching low, And roofed with heaven. Beyond its tonsure fringe, Birch trees and oaks, there pushed a thorn milkwhite, And close beside it slept in shade a fawn Whiter. The startled dam had left its side, And through the dark stems fled like flying gleam. Minded they were, the kernes, to kill that fawn, And all the priests stood silent; but the Saint Put forth his hand, and o'er her signed the Cross, And, stooping, on his shoulder placed her firm, And bade the brethren mark with stones her lair Dewless and dusk: then, singing as he went ‘Like as the hart desires the water brooks,’ He walked, that hill descending. Light from God O'ershone his face. Meantime the awakened fawn Now rolled her dark eye on the silver head Close by, now turning licked the wrinkled hand, Unfearing. Soon, with little whimpering sob, The doe drew near and paced at Patrick's side. At last they reached a little field low down Beneath that hill: there Patrick laid the fawn. King Dairè questioned Patrick of that deed, Incensed; and scornful asked, ‘Shall mitred man Play thus the shepherd and the forester?’ And Patrick answered, ‘Aged men, O king, Forget their reasons oft. Benignus seek, If haply God has shown him for what cause I wrought this thing.’ Then Dairè turned him back And faced Benignus; and with lifted hand, Pure as a maid's, and dimpled like a child's, Picturing his thoughts on air, the little monk Thus glossed that deed. ‘Great mystery, king, is Love: Poets its worthiness have sung in lays Unread by ruder ones like me; and yet Thus much the simplest and the rudest know, Dear is the fawn to her that gave it birth, And to the sceptred monarch dear the child That mounts his knee. Nor here the marvel ends; For, like yon star, the great Paternal Heart Through all the unmeted, unimagined years, While yet Creation uncreated hung, A thought, a dawn-streak on the verge extreme Of lonely Godhead's inner Universe, Panted and pants with splendour of its love, The Eternal Sire rejoicing in the Son And Both in Him Who still from Both proceeds, Bond of their love. Moreover, king, that Son Who, Virgin-born, raised from the ruinous gulf Our world, and made it footstool to God's throne, The same is Love, and died for Love, and reigns: Loveless, His Church were but a corse stone-cold; Loveless, her creed were but a winter leaf Network of barren thoughts, the cerement wan Of Faith extinct. Therefore our Saint revered The love and anguish of that mother doe, And inly vowed that where her offspring couched Christ's chiefest church should stand, from age to age Confession plain 'mid raging of the clans That God is Love;—His worship void and vain Disjoined from Love that, rising to the heights Even to the depths descends.’ Conversing thus, Macha they reached. Ere long where lay the fawn Stood God's new altar; and, ere many years, Far o'er the woodlands rose the church high-towered, Preaching God's peace to still a troubled world. The Saint who built it found not there his grave Though wished for; him God buried otherwhere, Fulfilling thus the counsels of His Will: But old, and grey, when many a winter's frost To spring had yielded, bent by wounds and woes Upon that church's altar looked once more King Dairè; at its font was joined to Christ; And, midway 'twixt that altar and that font, Rejoined his beauteous mate a later day. THE ARRAIGNMENT OF SAINT PATRICK. ARGUMENT. Secknall, the poet, brings, in sport, three heavy charges against Saint Patrick, who, supposing them to be serious, defends himself against them. Lastly Secknall sings a hymn written in praise of a Saint. Saint Patrick commends it, affirming that for once Fame has dispensed her honours honestly. Upon this, Secknall recites the first stave, till then craftily reserved, which offers the whole homage of that hymn to Patrick, who, though the humblest of men, has thus arrogated to himself the saintly Crown. There is laughter among the brethren. When Patrick now was old and nigh to death Undimmed was still his eye; his tread was strong; And there was ever laughter in his heart, And music in his laughter. In a wood Nigh to Ardmacha dwelt he with his monks; And there, like birds that cannot stay their songs Love-touched in Spring, or grateful for their nests, They to the woodsmen preached of Christ, their King, To swineherds, and to hinds that tended sheep, Yea, and to pilgrim guests from distant clans; His shepherd-worshipped birth when breath of kine Went o'er the Infant; all His wondrous works Or words from mount, or field, or anchored boat, And Christendom upreared for weal of men And Angel-wonder. Daily preached the monks And daily built their convent. Wildly sweet The season, prime of unripe spring, when March Distils from cup half gelid yet some drops Of finer relish than the hand of May Pours from her full-brimmed beaker. Frost, though gone, Had left its glad vibration on the air; Laughed the blue heavens as though they ne'er had frowned, Through leafless oak-boughs; limes of kindlier grace And swifter to believe Spring's ‘tidings good’ Took the sweet lights upon a breast bud-swoll'n, And crimson as the redbreast's; while, as when Clear rings a flute-note through sea-murmurs harsh, At intervals ran out a streak of green Across the dim-hued forest. From their wood The strong arms of the monks had hewn them space For all their convent needed; farmyard stored With stacks that all the winter long had clutched Their hoarded harvest sunshine; pasture green Whitened with sheep; fair garden fenceless still With household herbs new-sprouting; but, as oft Some conquered race, forth sallying in its spleen When serves the occasion, wins a province back, Or flouts at least the foe, so here once more Wild flowers, a clan unvanquished, raised their heads 'Mid sprouting wheat; and where from craggy height Pushed the grey ledge, the woodland host recoiled As though in Parthian flight; while many a bird, Barbaric from the inviolate forest launched Wild-warbled scorn on all that life reclaimed, Mute garth—still orchard. Child of distant hills, A proud stream, swollen by midnight rains, down leaped From rock to rock. It spurned the precinct new With airy dews silvering the bramble green And redd'ning more the beech-stock. 'Twas the hour Of rest, and every monk was glad at heart, For each had wrought with might. With hands upheld, Mochta, the priest, had thundered against sin, Wrath-roused, as when some prince too late returned Stares at his sea-side village all in flames, The slave-thronged ship escaped. The bishop, Erc, Had reconciled old feuds by Brehon Law Where Brehon Law was lawful. Boys wild-eyed Had from Benignus learned the church's song, Boys brightened now, yet tempered, by that age Gracious to stripling as to maid, that brings Valour to one and modesty to both Where youth is loyal to the Virgin-born. The giant meek, Mac Cairthen, on bent neck Had carried beam on beam, while Criemther felled The oaks, and from the anvil Laeban dashed The sparks in showers. A little way removed, Beneath a pine three vestals sat close-veiled: A song these childless sang of Bethlehem's Child, Low-toned, and worked their Altar-cloth, a Lamb All white on golden blazon; near it bled The bird that with her own blood feeds her young: Red drops affused her holy breast. These three Were daughters of three kings. The best and fairest, King Dairè's daughter, Erenait by name, Had loved Benignus in her Pagan years. He knew it not: full sweet to her his voice Chaunting in choir. One day through grief of love The maiden lay as dead: Benignus shook Dews from the font above her, and she woke With heart emancipate that outsoared the lark Lost in blue heavens. She loved the Spouse of Souls. It was as though some child that, dreaming, wept Its childish playthings lost, awaked by bells, Bride-bells, had found herself a queen new wed Unto her country's lord. While monk with monk Conversed, the son of Patrick's sister sat, Secknall by name, beside the window sole And marked where Patrick from his hill of prayer Approached, descending slowly. At the sight He, maker blithe of songs, and wild as hawk Albeit a Saint, whose wont it was at times Or shy, or strange, or shunning flattery's taint, To attempt with mockery those whom most he loved, Whispered a brother, ‘Speak to Patrick thus: “When all men praised thee, Secknall made reply, ‘A blessed man were Patrick save for this, Alms deeds he preaches not.’”’ The brother went: Ere long among them entered Patrick, wroth, Or, likelier, feigning wrath:—‘What man is he Who saith I preach not alms deeds?’ Secknall rose: ‘I said it, Father, and the charge is true.’ Then Patrick answered, ‘Out of Charity I preach not Charity. This people, won To Christ, ere long will prove a race of Saints; To give will be its passion, not to gain: Its heart is generous; but its hand is slack In all save war: herein there lurks a snare: The priest will fatten, and the beggar feast: But the lean land will yield nor chief nor prince Hire of two horses yoked to chariot beam.’ Then Secknall spake, ‘O Father, dead it lies Mine earlier charge against thee. Hear my next, Since in our Order's equal Brotherhood Censure uncensured is the right of all. You press to the earth your converts! gold you spurn; Yet bind upon them heavier load than when Conqueror his captive tasks. Have shepherds three Bowed them to Christ? “Build up a church,” you cry; So one must draw the sand, and one the stone And one the lime. Honouring the seven great Gifts You raise in one small valley churches seven. Who serveth you fares hard!’ The Saint replied, ‘Second as first! I came not to this land To crave scant service, nor with shallow plough Cleave I this glebe. The priest that soweth much, For here the land is fruitful, much shall reap: Who soweth little nought but weeds shall bind And poppies of oblivion.’ Secknall next: ‘Yet man to man will whisper, and the face Of all this people darken like a sea When pipes the coming storm.’ He answered, ‘Son, I know this people better. Fierce they are In anger; neither flies their thought direct; For some, though true to Nature, lie to men, And others, true to men, are false to God: Yet as the prince's is the poor man's heart; Burthen for God sustained no burden is To him; and those who most have given to Christ Largeliest His fulness share.’ Secknall replied, ‘Low lies my second charge; a third remains, Which, as a shaft from seasoned bow, not green, Shall pierce the mark. With convents still you sow The land: in other countries sparse and small They swell to cities here. A hundred monks On one late barren mountain dig and pray: A hundred nuns gladden one woodland lawn, Or sing in one small island. Well—'tis well! Yet, balance lost and measure, nought is well. The Angelic Life more common will become Than life of mortal men.’ The Saint replied, ‘No shaft from homicidal yew-tree bow Is thine, but winged of thistle-down! Now hear! Measure is good; but measure's law with scale Changeth; nor doth the part reflect the whole. Each nation hath its gift, and each to all Not equal ministers. If all were eye, Where then were ear? If all were ear or hand, Where then were eye? The nation is the part; The Church the whole’—But Criemther where he stood, Old warrior, shouted like a chief war-waked, ‘This land is Eire! No nation lives like her! A part! Who portions Eire?’ The Saint, with smile Resumed: ‘The whole that from the part receives, Repaying still that part, till man's whole race Grow to the fulness of Mankind redeemed. What gift hath God in eminence given to Eire? Singly, her race is feeble; strong when knit: Nought knits them truly save a heavenly aim. I knit them as an army unto God, Give them God's War! Yon star is militant! Its splendour 'gainst the dark must fight or die: So wars that Faith I preach against the world; And nations fitted least for this world's gain Can speed Faith's triumph best. Three hundred years, Well used, should make of Eire a northern Rome. Criemther! her destiny is this, or nought; Secknall! the highest only can she reach; Alone the Apostle's crown is hers: for this, A Rule I give her, strong, yet strong in Love; Monastic households build I far and wide; Monastic clans I plant among her clans, With abbots for their chiefs. The same shall live, Long as God's love o'errules them.’ Secknall then Knelt, reverent; yet his eye had in it mirth, And round the full bloom of the red rich mouth, No whit ascetic, ran a dim half smile. ‘Father, my charges three have futile fallen, And thrice, like some great warrior of the bards, Your conquering wheels above me you have driven. Brought low, I make confession. Once, in woods Wandering, we heard a sound, now loud, now low, As he that treads the sand-hills hears the sea High murmuring while he climbs the seaward slope, Low, as he drops to landward. 'Twas a throng Awed, yet tumultuous, wild-eyed, wondering, fierce, That, standing round a harper, stave on stave Acclaimed as each had ending. “War, still war!” Thou saidst; “the bards but sing of War and Death! Ah! if they sang that Death which conquered Death, Then, like a tide, this people, music-drawn, Would mount the shores of Christ! Bards love not us, Prescient that power, that power wielded elsewhere By priest, but here by them, shall pass to us: Yet we love them for good one day their gift.” Then didst thou turn on me an eye of might Such as on Malach, when thou bad'st him raise By miracle of prayer that babe boar-slain, And said'st, “Go, fell thy pine, and frame thy harp, And in the hearing of this people sing Some Saint, the friend of Christ.” Too long the attempt Shame-faced, I shunned; at last, like him of old, That better brother who refused, yet went, I made my hymn. 'Tis called “A Child of Life.”’ Then Patrick, ‘Welcome is the praise of Saints: Sing thou thy hymn.’ From kneeling Secknall rose And stood, and singing, raised his hand as when Her cymbal by the Red Sea Miriam raised While silent stood God's hosts, and silent lay Those host-entombing waters. Shook, like hers, His slight form wavering 'mid the gusts of song. He sang the Saint of God, create from nought To work God's Will. As others gaze on earth, Her vales, her plains, her green meads ocean-girt, So gazed the Saint for ever upon God Who girds all worlds—saw intermediate nought— And on Him watched the sunshine and the storm, And learned His Countenance, and from It alone Drew in upon his heart its day and night. That contemplation was for him no dream: It hurled him on his mission. As a sword He lodged his soul within the Hand Divine And wrought, keen-edged, God's counsel. Next to God, Next, and how near, he loved the souls of men: Yea, men to him were Souls; the unspiritual herd He saw as magic-bound, or chained to beast, And groaned to free them. For their sakes, unfearing He faced the ravening waves, and iron rocks, Hunger, and poniard's edge, and poisoned cup, And faced the face of kings, and faced the host Of demons raging for their realm o'erthrown. This was the Man of Love. Self-love cast out, The love made spiritual of a thousand hearts Met in his single heart, and kindled there A sun-like image of Love Divine. Within That Spirit-shadowed heart was Christ conceived Hourly through Faith, hourly through Love was born; Sole secret this of fruitfulness to Christ. Who heard him heard with his a lordlier Voice, Strong as that Voice which said, ‘Let there be light,’ And light o'erflowed their beings. He from each His secret won; to each God's secret told: He touched them, and they lived. In each, the flesh Subdued to soul, the affections, vassals proud By conscience ruled, and conscience lit by Christ, The whole man stood, planet full-orbed of powers In equipoise, Image restored of God. A nation of such men his portion was; That nation's Patriarch he. No wrangler loud; No sophist; lesser victories knew he none: No triumph his of sect, or camp, or court; The Saint his great soul flung upon the world, And took the people with him like a wind Missioned from God that with it wafts in spring Some wingèd race, a multitudinous night, Into new sun-bright climes. As Secknall sang, Nearer the Brethren drew. On Patrick's right Benignus stood; old Mochta on his left, Slow-eyed, with solemn smile and sweet; next Erc, Whose ever-listening countenance that hour Beyond its wont was listening; Criemther near, The workman Saint, his many-wounded hands Together clasped: forward each mighty arm On shoulders propped of Essa and of Bite, Leaned the meek giant Cairthen: twelve in all Clustering they stood and in them was one soul. When Secknall ceased, in silence still they hung Each upon each, glad-hearted since the meed Of all their toils shone out before them plain, Gold gates of heaven—a nation entering in. A light was on their faces, and without Spread a great light, for sunset now had fallen A Pentecostal fire upon the woods, Or else a rain of angels streamed o'er earth. In marvel gazed the twelve: yea, clans far off Stared from their hills, deeming the site aflame. That glory passed away, discourse arose On Secknall's hymn. Its radiance from his face Had, like the sunset's, vanished as he spake: ‘Father, what sayst thou?’ Patrick made reply, ‘My son, the hymn is good; for Truth is good; And Fame, obsequious often to base heads, For once is loyal, and its crown hath laid Where honour's debt was due.’ Then Secknall raised In triumph both his hands, and chaunted loud That hymn's first stave, earlier through craft withheld, Stave that to Patrick's name, and his alone, Offered that hymn's whole incense! Ceasing, he stood Low-bowed, with hands upon his bosom crossed. Great laughter from the Brethren came, their Chief Thus trapped, though late—he meekest man of men— To claim the saintly crown. First young, then old, Later the old, and sore against their will, That laughter raised. Last from the giant chest Of Cairthen forth it rolled its solemn bass, Like sea-sound swallowing lighter sounds hard by. But Patrick laughed not: o'er his face there passed Shade lost in light; and thus he spake, ‘O friends, That which I have to do I know in part: God grant I work my work. That which I am He knows Who made me. Saints He hath, good store: Their names are written in His Book of Life; Kneel down, my sons, and pray that if thus long I seem to stand, I fall not at the end.’ Then in a circle kneeling prayed the twelve. But when they rose, Secknall with serious brow Advanced, and knelt, and kissed Saint Patrick's foot, And said, ‘O Father, at thy hest that hymn I made, long labouring, and thy crown it stands: Thou, therefore, grant me gifts, for strong thy prayer.’ And Patrick said, ‘The house wherein thy hymn Is sung at morn or eve shall lack not bread: And if men sing it in a house new-built, Where none hath dwelt, nor bridegroom yet, nor bride, Nor hath the cry of babe been heard therein, Upon that house the watching of the Saints Of Eire, and Patrick's watching, shall be fixed Even as the stars.’ And Secknall said, ‘What more?’ Then Patrick added, ‘They that night and morn Down-lying and up-rising, sing that hymn, They too that softly whisper it, nigh death, If pure of heart, and liegeful unto Christ, Shall see God's face; and, since the hymn is long, Its grace shall rest for children and the poor Full measure on the last three lines; and thou Of this dear company shalt die the first, And first of Eire's Apostles.’ Then his cheek Secknall laid down once more on Patrick's foot, And answered, ‘Deo Gratias.’ Thus in mirth, And solemn talk, and prayer, that brother band In the golden age of Faith with great free heart Gave thanks to God that blissful eventide, A thousand and four hundred years and more Gone by. But now clear rang the compline bell, And two by two they wended towards their church Across a space for cloister set apart, Yet still with wood-flowers sweet, and scent beside Of sod that evening turned. The night came on; A dim ethereal twilight o'er the hills Deepened to dewy gloom. Against the sky Stood ridge and rock unmarked amid the day: A few stars o'er them shone. As bower on bower Let go the waning light, so bird on bird Let go its song. Two songsters still remained, Each feebler than a fountain soon to cease, And claimed somewhile across the dusking dell Rivals unseen in sleepy argument, Each, the last word:—a pause; and then, once more, An unexpected note:—a longer pause; And then, past hope, one other note, the last. A moment more the Brethren stood in prayer: The rising moon upon the church-roof new Glimmered; and o'er it sang an angel choir, ‘Venite Sancti.’ Entering, soon were said The psalm, ‘He giveth sleep,’ and hymn, ‘Lætare’; And in his solitary cell each monk Lay down, rejoicing in the love of God. The happy years went by. When Patrick now And all his company were housed with God That hymn, at morning sung, and noon, and eve, Even as it lulled the waves of warring clans So lulled with music lives of toil-worn men And charmed their ebbing breath. One time it chanced When in his convent Kevin with his monks Had sung it thrice, the board prepared, a guest, Foot-sore and hungered, murmured, ‘Wherefore thrice?’ And Kevin answered, ‘Speak not thus, my son, For while we sang it, visible to all, Saint Patrick was among us. At his right Benignus stood, and, all around, the Twelve, God's light upon their brows; while Secknall knelt Demanding meed of song. Moreover, son, This self-same day and hour, twelve months gone by, Patrick, our Patriarch, died; and happy Feast Is that he holds, by two short days alone Severed from his of Hebrew Patriarchs last, And Chief. The Holy House at Nazareth He ruled benign, God's Warder with white hairs; And still his feast, that silver star of March, When snows afflict the hill and frost the moor, With temperate beam gladdens the vernal Church— All praise to God Who draws that Twain so near.’ THE STRIVING OF SAINT PATRICK ON MOUNT CRUACHAN Now called Croagh Patrick, a mountain on the coast near Westport. ARGUMENT. Saint Patrick, seeing that now Erin believes, desires that the whole land should stand fast in belief till Christ returns to judge the world. For this end he resolves to offer prayer on Mount Cruachan; but Victor, the Angel who has attended him in all his labours, restrains him from that prayer as being too great. Notwithstanding, the Saint prays three times on the mountain, and three times all the demons of Erin contend against him, and twice Victor, the Angel, rebukes his prayers. In the end Saint Patrick scatters the demons with ignominy, and God's Angel bids him know that his prayer hath conquered through constancy. From realm to realm had Patrick trod the Isle; And evermore God's work beneath his hand, Since God had blessed that hand, ran out fullsphered, And brighter than a new-created star. The Island race, in feud of clan with clan Barbaric, gracious else and high of heart, Nor worshippers of self, nor dulled through sense, Beholding, not alone his wondrous works, But, wondrous more, the sweetness of his strength And how he neither shrank from flood nor fire, And how he couched him on the wintry rocks, And how he sang great hymns to One who heard, And how he cared for poor men and the sick, And for the souls invisible of men, To him made way—not simple hinds alone, But chiefly wisest heads, for wisdom then Prime wisdom saw in Faith; and, mixt with these, Chieftains and sceptred kings. Nigh Tara, first, Scorning the king's command, had Patrick lit His Paschal fire, and heavenward as it soared, The royal fire and all the Beltaine fires Shamed by its beam had withered round the Isle Like fires on little hearths whereon the sun Looks in his greatness. Later, to that plain Central 'mid Eire, ‘of Adoration’ named, Down-trampled for two thousand years and more By erring feet of men, the Saint had sped In Apostolic might, and kenned far off Ill-pleased, the nation's idol lifting high His head, and those twelve vassal gods around All mailed in gold and shining as the sun, A pomp impure. Ill-pleased the Saint had seen them, And raised the Staff of Jesus with a ban; Then he, that demon named of men Crom-dubh, With all his vassal gods, into the earth That knew her Maker, to their necks had sunk While round the island rang three times the cry Of fiends tormented. Not for this as yet Had Patrick perfected his strength: as yet The depths he had not trodden; nor had God Drawn forth His total forces in the man Hidden long since and sealed. For this cause he, Who still his own heart in triumphant hour Suspected most, remembering Milcho's fate, With fear lest aught of human mar God's work, And likewise from his handling of the Gael Knowing not less their weakness than their strength, Paused on his conquering way, and lonely sat In cloud of thought. The great Lent Fast had come: Its first three days went by; the fourth, he rose, And meeting his disciples that drew nigh Vouchsafed this greeting only: ‘Bide ye here Till I return,’ and straightway set his face Alone to that great hill ‘of Eagles’ named Huge Cruachan, that o'er the western deep Hung through sea-mist, with shadowing crag on crag, High-ridged, and dateless forest long since dead. That forest reached, the angel of the Lord Beside him, as he entered, stood and spake: ‘The gifts thy soul demands, demand them not; For they are mighty and immeasurable, And over great for granting.’ And the Saint: ‘This mountain Cruachan I will not leave Alive till all be granted, to the last.’ Then knelt he on the shrouded mountain's base, And was in prayer; and, wrestling with the Lord, Demanded wondrous things immeasurable, Not easy to be granted, for the land; Nor brooked repulse; and when repulse there came, Repulse that quells the weak and crowns the strong, Forth from its gloom like lightning on him flashed Intelligential gleam and insight winged That plainlier showed him all his people's heart, And all the wound thereof: and as in depth Knowledge descended, so in height his prayer Rose, and far spread; nor roused alone those Powers Regioned with God; for as the strength of fire When flames some palace pile, or city vast, Wakens a tempest round it dragging in Wild blast, and from the aggression mightier grows, So wakened Patrick's prayer the demon race, And drew their legions in upon his soul From near and far. First came the Accursed encamped On Connact's cloudy hills and watery moors; Old Umbhall's Heads, Iorras, and Arran Isle, And where Tyrawley clasps that sea-girt wood Fochlut, whence earliest rang the Children's Cry, To demons trump of doom. In stormy rack They came, and hung above the invested Mount Expectant. But, their mutterings heeding not, When Patrick still in puissance rose of prayer O'er all their armies round the realm dispersed There ran prescience of fate; and, north and south, From all the mountain-girdled coasts—for still Best site attracts worst Spirit—on they came, From Aileach's shore and Uladh's hoary cliffs, Which held the aeries of that eagle race More late in Alba Scotland. throned, ‘Lords of the Isles’— High chiefs whose bards, in strong transmitted line, Filled with the name of Fionn, and thine, Oiseen, The blue glens of that never-vanquished land— From those purpureal mountains that o'ergaze Rock-bowered Loch Lene Killarney. broidered with sanguine bead, They came, and many a ridge o'er sea-lake stretched That, autumn-robed in purple and in gold, Pontific vestment, guard the memories still Of monks who reared thereon their mystic cells, Finian and Kieran, Fiacre, and Enda's self Of hermits sire, and that sea-facing Saint Brendan, who, in his wicker boat of skins Before that Genoese a thousand years Found a new world; and many more that now Under wind-wasted Cross of Clonmacnoise Await the day of Christ. So rushed they on From all sides, and, close met, in circling storm Besieged the enclouded steep of Cruachan, That scarce the difference knew 'twixt night and day More than the sunless pole. Him sought they, him Whom infinitely near they might approach, Not touch, while firm his faith—their Foe that dragged, Sole-kneeling on that wood-girt mountain's base, With both hands forth their realm's foundation stone. Thus ruin filled the mountain: day by day The forest torment deepened; louder roared The great aisles of the devastated woods; Black cave replied to cave; and oaks, whole ranks, Colossal growth of immemorial years, Sown ere Milesius landed, or that race He vanquished, or that earliest Scythian tribe, Fell in long line, like deep-mined castle wall, At either side God's warrior. Slowly died At last, far echoed in remote ravines, The thunder: then crept forth a little voice That shrilly whispered to him thus in scorn: ‘Two thousand years yon race hath walked in blood Neck-deep; and shall it serve thy Lord of Peace?’ That whisper ceased. Again from all sides burst Tenfold the storm; and as it waxed, the Saint Waxed in strong heart; and, kneeling with stretched hands, Made for himself a panoply of prayer, And wound it round his bosom twice and thrice, And made a sword of comminating psalm, And smote at them that mocked him. Day by day, Till now the second Sunday's vesper bell Gladdened the little churches round the isle, That conflict raged: then, maddening in their ire, Sudden the Princedoms of the Dark, that rode This way and that way through the tempest, brake Their sceptres, and with one great cry it fell: At once o'er all was silence: sunset lit The world, that shone as though with face upturned It gazed on heavens by angel faces thronged And answered light with light. A single bird Carolled: and from the forest skirt down fell, Gem-like, the last drops of the exhausted storm. Then bowed the Saint his forehead to the ground Thanking his God; and there in sacred trance, Which was not sleep, abode not hours alone But silent nights and days; and, 'mid that trance, God fed his heart with unseen Sacraments, Immortal food. Awaking, Patrick felt Yearnings for nearer commune with his God, Though great its cost; and gat him on his feet, And, mile by mile, ascended through the woods Till stunted were its growths; and still he clomb Printing with sandalled foot the dewy steep: But when above the mountain rose the moon Brightening each mist, while sank the prone morass In double night, he came upon a stone Tomb-shaped, that flecked that steep: a little stream Dropped by it from the summits to the woods: Thereon he knelt; and was once more in prayer. Nor prayed unnoticed by that race abhorred. No sooner had his knees the mountain touched Than through their realm vibration went; and straight His prayer detecting back they trooped in clouds And o'er him closed, blotting with bat-like wing And inky pall, the moon. Then thunder pealed Once more, nor ceased from pealing. Over all Night ruled, except when blue and forkèd flash Revealed the on-circling waterspout or plunge Of rain beneath the blown cloud's ravelled hem, Or, huge on high, that lion-coloured steep Which, like a lion, roared into the night Answering the roaring from sea-caves far down. Dire was the strife. That hour the Mountain old, An anarch throned 'mid ruins, flung himself In madness forth on all his winds and floods, An omnipresent wrath! For God reserved, Too long the prey of demons he had been; Possession foul and fell. Now nigh expelled Those demons rent their victim freed. Aloft, They burst the rocky barrier of the tarn That downward dashed its countless cataracts, Drowning far vales. On either side the Saint A torrent rushed—mightiest of all these twain— Peeling the softer substance from the hills Their flesh, till glared, deep-trenched, the mountain's bones; And as those torrents widened, rocks down rolled Showering upon that unsubverted head Sharp spray ice-cold. Before him closed the flood, And closed behind, till all was raging flood, All but that tomb-like stone whereon he knelt. Unshaken there he knelt with hands outstretched, God's Athlete! For a mighty prize he strove, Nor slacked, nor any whit his forehead bowed: Fixed was his eye and keen; the whole white face Keen as that eye itself, though—shapeless yet— The infernal horde to ear not eye addressed Their battle. Back he drave them, rank on rank, Routed, with psalm, and malison, and ban, As from a sling flung forth. Revolt's blind spawn He named them; one time Spirits, now linked with brute, Yea, bestial more and baser: and as a ship Mounts with the mounting of the wave, so he O'er all the insurgent tempest of their wrath Rising rode on triumphant. Days went by, Then came a lull; and lo! a whisper shrill, Once heard before, again its poison cold Distilled: ‘Albeit to Christ this land should bow, Some conqueror's foot one day would quell her Faith.’ It ceased. Tenfold once more the storm burst forth: Once more the ecstatic passion of his prayer Met it, and, breasting, overbore, until Sudden the Princedoms of the dark that rode This way and that way through the whirlwind, dashed Their vanquished crowns of darkness to the ground With one long cry. Then silence came; and lo! The white dawn of the fourth fair Day of God O'erflowed the world. Slowly the Saint upraised His wearied eyes. Upon the mountain lawns Lay happy lights; and birds sang; and a stream That any five-years' child might overleap, Beside him lapsed crystalline between banks With violets all empurpled, and smooth marge Green as that spray which earliest sucks the spring. Then Patrick raised to God his orison On that fair mount, and planted in the grass His crosier staff, and slept; and in his sleep God fed his heart with unseen Sacraments, Manna of might divine. Three days he slept; The fourth he woke. Upon his heart there rushed Yearning for closer converse with his God Though great its cost; and on his feet he gat, And high, and higher yet, that mountain scaled, And reached at noon the summit. Far below Basking the island lay, through rainbow shower Gleaming in part, with shadowy moor, and ridge Blue in the distance looming. Westward stretched A galaxy of isles, and, these beyond, Infinite sea with sacred light ablaze, And high o'erhead there hung a cloudless heaven. Upon that summit kneeling, face to sea The Saint, with hands held forth and thanks returned, Claimed as his stately heritage that realm From north to south: but instant as his lip Printed with earliest pulse of Christian prayer That clear aërial clime Pagan till then, The Host Accursed, sagacious of his act, Rushed back from all the isle and round him met With anger seven times heated, since their hour, And this they knew, was come. Nor thunder din And challenge through the ear alone, sufficed That hour their rage malign that, craving sore Material bulk to rend his bulk—their foe's— Through fleshly strength of that their murder-lust Flamed forth in fleshly form phantoms night-black Though bodiless, yet to bodied mass as nigh As Spirits can reach. More thick than vultures winged To fields with carnage piled, the Accursèd thronged Making thick night which neither earth nor sky Could pierce, from sense expunged. In phalanx now, Anon in breaking legion, or in globe, With clang of iron pinion on they rushed And spectral dart high-held. Nor quailed the Saint, Contending for his people on that Mount, Nor spared God's foes; for as old minster towers Besieged by midnight storm send forth reply In storm outrolled of bells, so sent he forth Defiance from fierce lip, vindictive chaunt, And blight and ban, and maledictive rite Potent on face of Spirits impure to raise These plague-spots three, Defeat, Madness, Despair; Nor stinted flail of taunt—‘When first my bark Threatened your coasts, as now upon the hills Hung ye in cloud; as now, I raised this Cross; Ye fled before it and again shall fly!’ So hurled he back their squadrons. Day by day The hurricanes of war shook earth and heaven: Till now, on Holy Saturday, that hour Returned which maketh glad the Church of God When over Christendom in widowed fanes Two days by penance stripped, and dumb as though Some Antichrist had trodd'n them down, once more Swells forth amid the new-lit paschal lights The ‘Gloria in Excelsis’: sudden then That mighty conflict ceased, save one low voice Twice heard before, now edged with bitterer scoff, ‘That race thou lov'st, though fierce in wrath, is soft: Plenty and peace will melt their Faith one day:’ Then with that whisper dying, died the night: Then forth from darkness issued earth and sky: Then fled the phantoms far o'er ocean's wave, Thence to return not till the day of doom. But he, their conqueror wept, upon that height Standing; nor of his victory had he joy, Nor of that jubilant isle restored to light, Nor of that heaven relit; so worked that scoff Winged from the abyss; and ever thus the man With darkness communed and that poison cold: ‘If Faith indeed should flood the land with peace, And peace with gold, and gold eat out her heart Once true, till Faith one day through Faith's reward Or die, or live diseased, the shame of Faith, Then blacker were this land and more accursed Than lands that knew no Christ.’ And musing thus The whole heart of the man was turned to tears, A fount of bale and chalice brimmed with death— For oft a thought chance-born more racks than truth Proven and sure—and, weeping, still he wept Till drenched was all his sad monastic cowl As sea-weed on the dripping shelf storm-cast Latest, and tremulous still. As thus he wept Sudden beside him on that summit broad, Ran out a golden beam like sunset path Gilding the sea; and, turning, by his side Victor, God's angel, stood with lustrous brow Fresh from that Face no man can see and live. He, putting forth his hand, with living coal Snatched from God's altar, made that dripping cowl Dry as an Autumn sheaf. The angel spake: ‘Rejoice, for they are fled that hate thy land, And those are nigh that love it.’ Then the Saint Upraised his head; and lo! in snowy sheen Cresting high rock, and ridge, and airy peak, Innumerable the Sons of God all round Vested the invisible mountain with white light, As when the foam-white birds of ocean throng Sea-rock so close that none that rock may see. In trance the Living Creatures stood, with wings That pointing crossed upon their breasts; nor seemed As new arrived but native to that site Though veiled till now from mortal vision. Song They sang to soothe the vexed heart of the Saint— Love-song of Heaven: and slowly as it died Their splendours waned: and through that vanishing light Earth, sea, and heaven returned. To Patrick then, Thus Victor spake: ‘Depart from Cruachan, Since God hath given thee wondrous gifts, immense, And through thy prayer routed that rebel host.’ And Patrick, ‘Till the last of all my prayers Be granted, I depart not though I die:— One said, “Too fierce that race to bend to faith.”’ Then spake God's angel, mild of voice, and kind: ‘Not all are fierce that fiercest seem, for oft Fierceness is blindfold love, or love ajar. Souls thou wouldst have: for every hair late wet In this thy tearful cowl and habit drenched God gives these myriads seven of Souls redeemed From sin and doom; and Souls, beside, as many As o'er yon sea in legioned flight might hang Far as thine eye can range. But get thee down From Cruachan, for mighty is thy prayer.’ And Patrick made reply: ‘Not great thy boon! Watch have I kept, and wearied are mine eyes And dim; nor see they far o'er yonder deep.’ And Victor: ‘Have thou Souls from coast to coast In cloud full-stretched; but get thee down: this Mount God's Altar is, and puissance adds to prayer.’ And Patrick: ‘On this Mountain wept have I; And therefore giftless will I not depart: One said, “Although that People should believe Yet conqueror's heel one day would quell their Faith.”’ To whom the angel, mild of voice, and kind: ‘Conquerors are they that subjugate the soul: This also God concedes thee; conquering foe Trampling this land, shall tread not out her Faith Nor sap by fraud, so long as thou in heaven Look'st on God's Face; nay, by that Faith subdued, That foe shall serve and live. But get thee down And worship in the vale.’ Then Patrick said, ‘Live they that list! Full sorely wept have I, Nor will I hence depart unsatisfied: One said, “Grown soft, that race their Faith will shame;” Say therefore what the Lord thy God will grant, Nor stint His hand; since never scanter grace Fell yet on head of nation-taming man Than thou to me hast portioned till this hour.’ Then answer made the angel, soft of voice: ‘Not all men stumble when a Nation falls; There are that stand upright. God gives thee this: They that are faithful to thy Faith, that walk Thy way, and keep thy covenant with God, And daily sing thy hymn, when comes the Judge With Sign blood-red facing Jehosaphat, And fear lays prone the many-mountained world, The same shall 'scape the doom.’ And Patrick said, ‘That hymn is long, and hard for simple folk, And hard for children.’ And the angel thus: ‘At least from “Christum Illum” let them sing, And keep thy Faith: when comes the Judge, the pains Shall take not hold of such. Is that enough?’ And Patrick answered, ‘That is not enough.’ Then Victor: ‘Likewise this thy God accords: The Dreadful Coming and the Day of Doom Thy land shall see not; for before that day Seven years, a great wave arched from out the deep, Ablution pure, shall sweep the isle and take Her children to its peace. Is that enough?’ And Patrick answered, ‘That is not enough.’ Then spake once more that courteous angel kind: ‘What boon demand'st thou?’ And the Saint, ‘No less Than this. Though every nation, ere that day Recreant from creed and Christ, old troth forsworn, Should flee the sacred scandal of the Cross Through pride, as once the Apostles fled through fear, This Nation of my love, a priestly house, Beside that Cross shall stand, fate-firm, like him That stood beside Christ's Motion.’ Straightway, as one Who ends debate, the angel answered stern: ‘That boon thou claimest is too great to grant: Depart thou from this mountain, Cruachan, In peace: and find that Nation which thou lov'st, That like thy body is, and thou her head, For foes are round her set in valley and plain, And instant is the battle.’ Then the Saint: ‘The battle for my People is not there, With them, low down, but here upon this height From them apart, with God. This Mount of God Dowerless and bare I quit not till I die; And dying, I will leave a Man Elect To keep its keys, and pray my prayer, and name Dying in turn, his heir, successive line, Even till the Day of Doom.’ Then heavenward sped Victor, God's angel, and the Man of God Turned to his offering; and all day he stood Offering in heart that Offering Undefiled Which Abel offered, and Melchisedek, And Abraham, Patriarch of the faithful race, In type, and which in fulness of the times The Victim-Priest offered on Calvary, And, bloodless, offers still in Heaven and Earth, Whose impetration makes the whole Church one. Thus offering stood the man till eve, and still Offered; and as he offered, far in front Along the aërial summit once again Ran out that beam like fiery pillar prone Or sea-path sunset-paved; and by his side That angel stood. Then Patrick, turning not His eyes in prayer upon the West close held Demanded, ‘From the Maker of all worlds What answer bring'st thou?’ Victor made rep ‘Down knelt in Heaven the Angelic Orders Nin And all the Prophets and the Apostles knelt, And all the Creatures of the hand of God Visible, and invisible, down knelt, While thou thy mighty Mass, though altarless, Offeredst in spirit, and thine Offering joined; And all God's Saints on earth, or roused from sleep Or on the wayside pausing, knelt, the cause Not knowing; likewise yearned the Souls to God In that fire-clime benign that clears from sin; And lo! the Lord thy God hath heard thy prayer, Since fortitude in prayer—and this thou know'st,’— Smiling the Bright One spake, ‘is that which lays Man's hand upon God's sceptre. That thou sought'st Shall lack not consummation. Many a race Shrivelling in sunshine of its prosperous years, Shall cease from faith, and, shamed though shameless, sink Back to its native clay; but over thine God shall extend the shadow of His Hand, And through the night of centuries teach to her In woe that song which, when the nations wake, Shall sound their glad deliverance: nor alone This nation, from the blind dividual dust Of instincts brute, thoughts driftless, warring wills By thee evoked and shapen by thy hands To God's fair image which confers alone Manhood on nations, shall to God stand true; But nations far in undiscovered seas, Her stately progeny, while ages fleet Shall wear the kingly ermine of her Faith, Fleece uncorrupted of the Immaculate Lamb, For ever: lands remote shall raise to God Her fanes; and eagle-nurturing isles hold fast Her hermit cells: thy nation shall not walk Accordant with the Gentiles of this world, But as a race elect sustain the Crown Or bear the Cross: and when the end is come, When in God's Mount the Twelve great Thrones are set, And round it roll the Rivers Four of fire, And in their circuit meet the Peoples Three Of Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, fulfilled that day Shall be the Saviour's word, what time He stretched Thy crosier-staff forth from His glory-cloud And sware to thee, “When they that with Me walked Sit with Me on their everlasting thrones Judging the Twelve Tribes of Mine Israel, Thy People thou shalt judge in righteousness.” Thou therefore kneel, and bless thy Land of Eire.’ Then Patrick knelt, and blessed the land, and said, ‘Praise be to God who hears the sinner's prayer.’ EPILOGUE. THE CONFESSION OF SAINT PATRICK. ARGUMENT Before his death, Saint Patrick makes confession to his brethren concerning his life; of his love for that land which had been his House of Bondage; of his ceaseless prayer in youth: of his sojourn at Tours, where St. Martin had made abode, at Auxerres with St. Germanus, and at Lerins with the Contemplatives: of that mystic mountain where the Redeemer Himself lodged the Crosier Staff in his hand; of Pope Celestine who gave him his Mission; of his Visions; of his Labours. His last charge to the sons of Erin is that they should walk in Truth; that they should put from them the spirit of Revenge; and that they should hold fast to the Faith of Christ. At Saul then, by the inland-spreading sea, There where began my labour, comes the end: I, blind and witless, willed it otherwise: God willed it thus. When prescience came of death I said, ‘My Resurrection place I choose’— O fool, for ne'er since boyhood choice was mine Save choice to subject will of mine to God— ‘At great Ardmacha.’ Thitherward I turned; But in my pathway, with forbidding hand, Victor, God's angel stood. ‘Not so,’ he said, ‘For in Ardmacha stands thy princedom fixed, Age after age, thy teaching, and thy law, But not thy grave. Return thou to that shore Thy place of small beginnings, and thereon Lessen in body and mind, and grow in spirit: Then sing to God thy little hymn and die.’ Yea, Lord, my mouth would praise Thee ere I die, The Father, and the Son, and Holy Spirit Who knittest in His Church the just to Christ: Help me, my sons—mine orphans soon to be— Help me to praise Him; ye that round me sit On those grey rocks; ye that have faithful been, Honouring, despite dishonour of my sins, His servant: I would praise Him yet once more, Though mine the stammerer's voice, or as a child's; For it is written, ‘Stammerers shall speak plain Sounding Thy Gospel.’ ‘They whom Christ hath sent Are Christ's Epistle, borne to ends of earth, Writ by His Spirit, and plain to souls elect:’ Lord, am not I of Thine Apostolate? Yea, by abjection Thine, by suffering Thine! Till I was humbled I was as a stone In deep mire sunk. Then, stretched from heaven, Thy hand Slid under me in might, and lifted me, And fixed me in Thy Temple where Thou wouldst. Wonder, ye great ones, wonder, ye the wise! On me, the last and least, this charge was laid This crown, that I in humbleness and truth Should walk this nation's Servant till I die. Therefore, a youth of sixteen years, or less, With others of my land by pirates seized I stood on Erin's shore. Our bonds were just; Our God we had forsaken, and His Law, And mocked His priests. Tending a stern man's swine I trod those Dalaraida hills that face Eastward to Alba. Six long years went by; But—sent from God—Memory, and Faith, and Fear Moved on my spirit as winds upon the sea, And the Spirit of Prayer came down. Full many a day Climbing the mountain tops, one hundred times I flung upon the storm my cry to God. Nor frost, nor rain might harm me, for His love Burned in my heart. Through love I made my fast; And in my fasts one night I heard this voice, ‘Thou fastest well: soon shalt thou see thy Land.’ Later, once more thus spake it: ‘Southward fly, Thy ship awaits thee.’ Many a day I fled, And found the black ship dropping down the tide, And entered with those Gentiles by Thy grace Vanquished, though first they spurned me, and was free. It was Thy leading, Lord; the Hand was Thine! For now when, perils past, I walked secure, Kind greetings round me, and the Christian Rite, There rose a clamorous yearning in my heart, And memories of that land so far, so fair, And lost in such a gloom. And through that gloom The eyes of little children shone on me, So ready to believe! Such children oft Ran by me naked in and out the waves, Or danced in circles upon Erin's shores, Like creatures never fallen! Thought of such Passed into thought of others. From my youth Both men and women, maidens most, to me As children seemed; and O the pity then To mark how oft they wept, how seldom knew Whence came the wound that galled them! As I walked, Each wind that passed me whispered, ‘Lo, that race Which trod thee down! Requite with good their ill! Thou know'st their tongue; old man to thee, and youth, For counsel came, and lambs would lick thy foot; And now the whole land is a sheep astray That bleats to God.’ Alone one night I mused, Burthened with thought of that vocation vast. O'er-spent I sank asleep. In visions then, Satan my soul plagued with temptation dire. Methought, beneath a cliff I lay, and lo! Thick-legioned demons o'er me dragged a rock, That falling, seemed a mountain. Near, more near, O'er me it blackened. Sudden from my heart This thought leaped forth: ‘Elias! Him invoke!’ That name invoked, vanished the rock; and I, On mountains stood watching the rising sun, As stood Elias once on Carmel's crest, Gazing on heaven unbarred, and that white cloud, A thirsting land's salvation. Might Divine! Thou taught'st me thus my weakness; and I vowed To seek Thy strength. I turned my face to Tours, There where in years gone by Thy soldier-priest Martin had ruled, my kinsman in the flesh. Dead was the lion; but his lair was warm: In it I laid me, and a conquering glow Rushed up into my heart. I heard discourse Of Martin still, his valour in the Lord, His rugged warrior zeal, his passionate love For Hilary, his vigils, and his fasts, And all his pitiless warfare on the Powers Of darkness; and one day, in secrecy, With Ninian, missioned then to Alba's shore, I peered into his branch-enwoven cell, Half-way between the river and the rocks, From Tours a mile and more. So passed eight years Till strengthened was my heart by discipline: Then spake a priest, ‘Brother, thy will is good, Yet rude thou art of learning as a beast; Fare thee to great Germanus of Auxerres, Who lightens half the West!’ I heard, and went, And to that Saint was subject fourteen years. He from my mind removed the veil; ‘Lift up,’ He said, ‘thine eyes!’ and like a mountain land The Queenly Science stood before me plain, From rocky buttress up to peak of snow: The great Commandments first, Edicts, and Laws That bastion up man's life:—then high o'er these The forest huge of Doctrine, one, yet many, Forth stretching in innumerable aisles, At the end of each, the self-same glittering star:— Lastly, the Life God-hidden. Day by day, With him for guide, that first and second realm I tracked, and learned to shun the abyss flower-veiled, And scale heaven-threatening heights. This, too, he taught, Himself long time a ruler and a prince, The regimen of States from chaos won To order, and to Christ. Prudence I learned, And sageness in the government of men, By me sore needed soon. O stately man, In all things great, in action and in thought, And plain as great! To Britain called, the Saint Trod down that great Pelagian Blasphemy, Chief portent of the age. But better far He loved his cell. There sat he vigil-worn, In cowl and dusky tunic hued like earth Whence issued man and unto which returns; I marvelled at his wrinkled brows, and hands Still tracing, enter or depart who would, From morn to night his parchments. There, once more, O God, Thine eye was on me, or my hand Once more had missed the prize. Temptation now Whispered in softness, ‘Wisdom's home is here: Here bide untroubled.’ Almost I had fallen; But, by my side, in visions of the night, God's angel, Victor, stood as one that hastes, On travel sped. Unnumbered missives lay Clasped in his hands. One stretched he forth, inscribed ‘The wail of Erin's Children.’ As I read The cry of babes, from Erin's western coast And Fochlut's forest, and the wintry sea, Shrilled o'er me, clamouring, ‘Holy youth, return! Walk thou among us!’ I could read no more. Thenceforth rose up renewed mine old desire: My kinsfolk mocked me. ‘What! past woes too scant! Slave of four masters, and the best a churl! Thy Gospel they will trample under foot, And rend thee! Late to them Palladius preached: They drave him as a leper from their shores.’ I stood in agony of staggering mind And warring wills. Then, lo! at dead of night I heard a mystic voice, till then unheard, I knew not if within me or close by, That swelled in passionate pleading; nor the words Grasped I, so great they seemed and wonderful, Till sank that tempest to a whisper:—‘He Who died for thee is He that in thee groans.’ Then fell, methought, scales from mine inner eyes: Then saw I—terrible that sight, yet sweet— Within me saw a Man that in me prayed With groans unutterable. That Man was girt For mission far. My heart recalled that word, ‘The Spirit helpeth our infirmities; That which we lack we know not, but the Spirit Himself for us doth intercession make With groanings which may never be revealed.’ That hour my vow was vowed; and he approved, My master and my guide. ‘But go,’ he said, ‘First to that island in the Tyrrhene Sea, Where live the high Contemplatives to God: There learn perfection; there that Inner Life Win thou, God's strength amid the world's loud storm: Nor fear lest God should frown on such delay, For Heavenly Wisdom is compassionate: Slowly before man's weakness moves it on; Softly: so moved of old the Wise Men's Star, Which curbed its lightning ardours and forbore Honouring the pensive tread of hoary Eld, Honouring the burthened slave, the camel line Long-linked, with level head and foot that fell As though in sleep, printing the silent sands.’ Thus, smiling, spake Germanus, large in lore. So in that island-Eden I sojourned, Lerins, and saw where Vincent lived, and his, Life fountained from on high. That life was Love; For all their mighty knowledge food became Of Love Divine, and took, by Love absorbed, Shape from his flame-like body. Hard their beds; Ceaseless their prayers. They tilled a sterile soil; Beneath their hands it blossomed like the rose: O'er thymy hollows blew the nectared airs; Blue ocean flashed through olives. They had fled From praise of men; yet cities far away Rapt those meek saints to fill the bishop's throne. I saw the light of God on faces calm That blended with man's meditative might Simplicity of childhood, and, with both The sweetness of that flower-like sex which wears Through love's Obedience twofold crowns of Love. O blissful time! In that bright island bloomed The third high region on the Hills of God, Above the rock, above the wood, the cloud:— There laughs the luminous air, there bursts anew Spring bud in summer on suspended lawns; There the bell tinkles while once more the lamb Trips by the sun-fed runnel: there green vales Lie lost in purple heavens. Transfigured Life! This was thy glory, that, without a sigh, Who loved thee yet could leave thee! Thus it fell: One morning I was on the sea, and lo! An isle to Lerins near, but fairer yet, Till then unseen! A grassy vale sea-lulled Wound inward, breathing balm, with fruited trees, And stream through lilies gliding. By a door There stood a man in prime, and others sat Not far, some grey; and one, a weed of years, Lay like a withered wreath. An old man spake: ‘See what thou seest, and scan the mystery well! The man who stands so stately in his prime Is of this company the eldest born. The Saviour in His earthly sojourn, Risen, Perchance, or ere His Passion, who can tell, Stood up at this man's door; and this man rose, And let Him in, and made for Him a feast; And Jesus said, “Tarry, till I return.” Moreover, others are there on this isle, Both men and maids, who saw the Son of Man, And took Him in, and shine in endless youth; But we, the rest, in course of nature fade, For we believe, yet saw not God, nor touched.’ Then spake I, ‘Here till death my home I make, Where Jesus trod.’ And answered he in prime, ‘Not so; the Master hath for thee thy task. Parting, thus spake He: “Here for Mine Elect Abide thou. Bid him bear this crosier staff; My blessing rests thereon: the same shall drive The foes of God before him.”’ Answer thus I made, ‘That crosier staff I will not touch Until I take it from that nailed-pierced Hand.’ From these I turned, and clomb a mountain high, Hermon by name; and there—was this, my God, In visions of the Lord, or in the flesh?— I spake with Him, the Lord of Life, Who died; He from the glory stretched the Hand nail-pierced, And placed in mine that crosier staff, and said: ‘Upon that day when they that with Me walked Sit with Me on their everlasting Thrones, Judging the Twelve Tribes of Mine Israel, Thy People thou shalt judge in righteousness.’ Forthwith to Rome I fled; there knelt I down Above the bones of Peter and of Paul, And saw the mitred embassies from far, And saw Celestine with his head high held As though it bore the Blessed Sacrament; Chief Shepherd of the Saviour's flock on earth. Tall was the man, and swift; white-haired; with eye Starlike and voice a trumpet clear that pealed God's Benediction o'er the city and globe; Yea, and whene'er his palm he lifted, still Blessing before it ran. Upon my head He laid both hands, and ‘Win,’ he said, ‘to Christ One realm the more!’ Moreover, to my charge Relics he gave, unnumbered, without price; And when those relics lost had been, and found, And at his feet I wept, he chided not; But, smiling, said, ‘Thy glorious task fulfilled, House them in thy new country's stateliest church By cresset girt of ever-burning lamps, And never-ceasing anthems.’ Northward then Returned I, missioned. Yet once more, but once, That old temptation proved me. When they sat, The Elders, making inquest of my life, Sudden a certain brother rose, and spake, ‘Shall this man be a Bishop, who hath sinned?’ My dearest friend was he. To him alone One time had I divulged a sin by me Through ignorance wrought when fifteen years of age; And after thirty years, behold, once more, That sin had found me out! He knew my mission: When in mine absence slander sought my name, Mine honour he had cleared. Yet now—yet now— That hour the iron passed into my soul: Yea, well nigh all was lost. I wept, ‘Not one, No heart of man there is that knows my heart, Or in its anguish shares.’ Yet, O my God! I blame him not: from Thee that penance came: Not for man's love should Thine Apostle strive, Thyself alone his great and sole reward. Thou laid'st that hour a fiery hand of love Upon a faithless heart; and it survived. At dead of night a Vision gave me peace. Slowly from out the breast of darkness shone Strange characters, a writing unrevealed: And slowly thence and infinitely sad, A Voice: ‘Ill-pleased, this day have we beheld The face of the Elect without a name.’ It said not, ‘Thou hast grieved,’ but ‘We have grieved;’ With import plain, ‘O thou of little faith! Am I not nearer to thee than thy friends? Am I not inlier with thee than thyself?’ Then I remembered, ‘He that touches you Doth touch the very apple of mine eye.’ Serene I slept. At morn I rose and ran Down to the shore, and found a boat, and sailed. That hour true life's beginning was, O Lord, Because the work Thou gav'st into my hands Prospered between them. Yea, and from the work The Power forth issued. Strength in me was none, Nor insight, till the occasion: then Thy sword Flamed in my grasp, and beams were in mine eyes That showed the way before me, and nought else. Thou mad'st me know Thy Will. As taper's light Veers with a wind man feels not, o'er my heart Hovered thenceforth some Pentecostal flame That bent before that Will. Thy Truth, not mine, Lightened this People's mind; Thy Love inflamed Their hearts; Thy Hope upbore them as on wings. Valiant that race, and simple, and to them Not hard the godlike venture of belief: Conscience was theirs: tortuous too oft in life Their thoughts, when passionate most, then most were true, Heart-true. With naked hand firmly they clasped The naked Truth: in them Belief was Act. A tribe from Thy far East they called themselves: Their clans were Patriarch households, rude through war: Old Pagan Rome had known them not; their Isle Virgin to Christ had come. Oh how unlike Her sons to those old Roman Senators, Scorn of Germanus oft, who breathed the air Fouled by dead Faiths successively blown out, Or Grecian sophist with his world of words, That, knowing all, knew nothing! Praise to Thee, Lord of the night-time as the day, Who keep'st Reserved in blind barbaric innocence, Pure breed, when boastful lights corrupt the wise, With healthier fruit to bless a later age. I to that people all things made myself For Christ's sake, building still that good they lacked On good already theirs. In courts of kings I stood: before mine eye their eye went down, For Thou wert with me. Gentle with the meek, I suffered not the proud to mock my face: Thus by the anchors twain of Love and Fear, Since Love, not perfected, gains strength from Fear, I bound to Thee this nation. Parables I spake in; parables in act I wrought Because the people's mind was in the sense. At Imbher Dea they scoffed Thy word: I raised Thy staff, and smote with barrenness that flood: Then learned they that the world was Thine, not ruled By Sun or Moon, their famed ‘God-Elements’: Yea, like Thy Fig-tree cursed, that river banned Witnessed Thy Love's stern pureness. From the grass The little three-leaved herb, I stooped and plucked, And preached the Trinity. Thy Staff I raised, And bade—not ravening beast—but reptiles foul Flee to the abyss like that blind herd of old; Then spake I: ‘Be not babes, but understand: Thus in your spirit lift the Cross of Christ: Banish base lusts; so God shall with you walk As once with man in Eden.’ With like aim Convents I reared for holy maids, then sought The marriage feast, and cried, ‘If God thus draws Close to Himself those virgin hearts, and yet Blesses the bridal troth, and infant's font, How white a thing should be the Christian home!’ Marvelling, they learned what heritage their God Possessed in them! how wide a realm, how fair. Lord, save in one thing only, I was weak— I loved this people with a mother's love, For their sake sanctified my spirit to Thee In vigil, fast, and meditation long, On mountain and on moor. Thus, Lord, I wrought, Trusting that so Thy lineaments divine, Deeplier upon my spirit graved, might pass Thence on that hidden burthen which my heart Still from its substance feeding, with great pangs Strove to bring forth to Thee. O loyal race! Me too they loved. They waited me all night On lonely roads; and, as I preached, the day To those high listeners seemed a little hour. Have I not seen ten thousand brows at once Flash in the broad light of some Truth new risen, And felt like him, that Saint who cried, flame-girt, ‘At last do I begin to be a Christian’? Have I not seen old foes embrace? Seen him, That white-haired man who dashed him on the ground, Crying aloud, ‘My buried son, forgive! Thy sire hath touched the hand that shed thy blood’? Fierce chiefs knelt down in penance! Lord! how oft Shook I their tear-drop sparkles from my gown! 'Twas the forgiveness taught them all the debt, Great-hearted penitents! How many a youth Contemned the praise of men! How many a maid— O not in narrowness, but Love's sweet pride And love-born shyness—jealous for a mate Himself not jealous—spurned terrestrial love, Glorying in heavenly Love's fair oneness! Race High-dowered! God's Truth seemed some remembered thing To them; God's Kingdom smiled, their native haunt Prophesied then their daughters and their sons: Each man before the face of each upraised His hand on high, and said, ‘The Lord hath risen!’ Then, like a stream from ice released, forth fled And wafted far the tidings, flung them wide, Shouted them loud from rocky ridge o'er bands Marching far down to war! The sower sowed With happier hope; the reaper bending sang, ‘Thus shall God's Angels reap the field of God When we are ripe for heaven.’ Lovers new-wed Drank of that water changed to wine, thenceforth Breathing on earth heaven's sweetness. Unto such More late, whate'er of brightness time or will Infirm had dimmed, shone back from infant brows By baptism lit. Each age its garland found: Fair shone on trustful childhood faith divine: Eld, once a weight of wrinkles now upsoared In venerable lordship of white hairs, Seer-like and sage. Healed was a nation's wound: All men believed who willed not disbelief; And sat in that oppugnancy steel-mailed: They cried, ‘Before thy priests our bards shall bow, And all our clans put on thy great Clan Christ!’ For your sake, O my brethren, and my sons, These things have I recorded. Something I wrought: Strive ye in loftier labours: strive, and win: Your victory shall be mine: my crown are ye. My part is ended now. I lived for Truth: I to this people gave that truth I knew; My witnesses ye are I grudged it not: Freely did I receive, freely I gave; Baptizing, or confirming, or ordaining, I sold not things divine. Of mine own store Ofttimes the hire of fifteen men I paid For guard where bandits lurked. When prince or chief Laid on God's altar ring, or torque, or gold, I sent them back. Too fortunate, too beloved, I said, ‘Can he Apostle be who bears Such scanty marks of Christ's Apostolate, Hunger, and thirst, and scorn of men?’ For this, Those pains they spared I spared not to myself, The body's daily death. I make not boast: What boast have I? If God His servant raised, He knoweth—not ye—how oft I fell: how low; How oft in faithless longings yearned my heart For faces of His Saints in mine own land, Remembered fields far off. This, too, He knoweth, How perilous is the path of great attempts, How oft pride meets us on the storm-vexed height, Pride, or some sting its scourge. My hope is He: His hand, my help so long, will loose me never: And, thanks to God, the sheltering grave is near. How still this eve! The morn was racked with storm: 'Tis past; the skylark sings; the tide at flood Sighs a soft joy: alone those lines of weed Report the wrath foregone. Yon watery plain Far shines, a mingled sea of glass and fire, Even as that Beatific Sea outspread Before the Throne of God. 'Tis Paschal Tide;— O sorrowful, O blissful Paschal Tide! Fain would I die on Holy Saturday; For then, as now, the storm is past—the woe; And, somewhere 'mid the shades of Olivet Lies sealed the sacred cave of that Repose Watched by the Holy Women. Earth, that sing'st, Since first He made thee, thy Creator's praise, Sing, sing thy Saviour's! Myriad-minded sea, How that bright secret thrills thy rippling lips Which shake, yet speak not! Thou that mad'st the worlds, Man, too, Thou mad'st; within Thy Hands the life Of each was shapen, and new-wov'n ran out, New-willed each moment. What makes up that life? Love infinite, and nothing else save love! Help ere need came, deliverance ere defeat; At every step an angel to sustain us, An angel to retrieve! My years are gone: Sweet were they with a sweetness felt but half Till now;—not half discerned. Those blessèd years I would re-live, deferring thus so long The Vision of Thy Face, if thus with gaze Cast backward I might see that guiding hand Step after step, and kiss it. Happy isle! Be true; for God hath graved on thee His Name; God, with a wondrous ring, hath wedded thee; God on a throne divine hath 'stablished thee:— Light of a darkling world! Lamp of the North! My race, my realm, my great inheritance, To lesser nations leave inferior crowns; Speak ye the thing that is; be just, be kind; Live ye God's Truth, and in its strength be free! This day to Him, the Faithful and the True, For Whom I toiled, my spirit I commend. That which I am, He knoweth: I know not now: But I shall know ere long. If I have loved Him I seek but this for guerdon of my love, With holier love to love Him to the end: If I have vanquished others to His love Would God that this might be their meed and mine In witness for His love to pour our blood A glad stream forth, though vultures or wild beasts Rent our unburied bones! Thou setting sun, That sink'st to rise, that time shall come at last When in thy splendours thou shalt rise no more; And, darkening with the darkening of thy face, Who worshipped thee with thee shall cease; but those Who worshipped Christ shall shine with Christ abroad, Eternal beam, and Sun of Righteousness, In endless glory. For His sake alone I, bondsman in this land, re-sought this land. All ye who name my name in later times, Say to this People, since vindictive rage Tempts them too often, that their Patriarch gave Pattern of pardon ere in words he preached That God who pardons. Wrongs if they endure In after years, with fire of pardoning love Sin-slaying, bid them crown the head that erred: For bread denied let them give Sacraments, For darkness light, and for the House of Bondage The glorious freedom of the sons of God: This is my last Confession ere I die. OISEEN THE BARD AND SAINT PATRICK. I. THE GREAT CONTENTION. Not seldom crossed by bodings sad, In words though kind yet hard Spake Patrick to his guest, Oiseen; For Patrick loved the bard In whose broad bosom, swathed with beard Like cliffs with ivy trailed, A Christian strove with a Pagan soul, And neither quite prevailed. Silent as shades the shadowing monks O'er cloistral courts might glide; But the War-Bard strode through the church itself Like hunter on mountain-side. The Priest might soften his Compline psalm Till it seemed but the night-wind's sigh: Oiseen, if the stag-hunt swept by at mass, Would echo the stag-hound's cry! And thus one day, while his beads he told, Fierce thoughts, a rebel breed, Burst up from old graves in the warrior's heart, And he stormed at priest and creed. ‘Woe, woe! for the priestly tribe this hour On the Feinè Hill have sway! Glad am I that scarce their shapes I see; Half-blind am I this day. ‘Woe, woe, thou Palace of Cruachan! Thy sceptre is down and thy sword; The chase goes over thy grassy roof, The monk in thy courts is lord! ‘Thou man with the mitre and vestments broad, And the bearing of grave command, Rejoice that Diarmid this day is dust! Right heavy was his clenched hand! ‘Thou man with the bell! I rede thee well: Were Diorring living this day, Thy book he would take, and thy bell would break On the base of yon pillar grey! ‘Thou man with miraculous crosier-staff, Though puissant thou art, and tall, Were Goll but here he would dash thy gear In twain on thy convent wall! ‘Were Conan living, the bald-head shrill, With the scourge of his scoff and gibe He would break thy neck, and thy convent wreck, And lash from the land thy tribe! ‘But one of our chiefs had spared thy head— My Oscar, my son, my child: He was storm in the foray and fire in the fight, But in peace he was maiden-mild.’ Then Patrick answered: ‘Old man, old man, That Pagan realm lies low: Our home is thine! Forget thy chiefs, And thy deeds gone by forego! ‘High feast thou hast on the festal days, And cakes on the days of fast:’ ‘Thou liest, thou priest, for in wrath and scorn Thy cakes to the dogs I cast!’ ‘Old man, thou hearest our Christian hymns: Such strains thou hadst never heard:’ ‘Thou liest, thou priest! for in Letter Lee wood I have listened its famed blackbird! ‘I have heard the music of meeting swords, And the grating of barks on the strand, And the shout from the breasts of the men of help That leaped from the decks to land! ‘Twelve hounds had my sire, with throats like bells, Loud echoed on lake and bay: By this hand, they lacked but the baptism rite To chaunt with thy monks this day!’ Oiseen's white head on his breast dropt down, Till his hair and his beard, made one, Shone out like the spine of a frosty hill Far seen in the wintry sun. ‘One question, Patrick! I ask of thee, Thou king of the saved and shriven: My sire, and his chiefs, have they their place In thy City, star-built, of heaven?’ ‘Oiseen, old chief of the harp and sword, That questionest of the soul, That City they tread not who love but war: Their realm is a realm of dole.’ ‘By this head, thou liest, thou son of Calphurn! In heaven I would scorn to bide If my father and Oscar were exiled men, And no friend at my side.’ ‘That City, old man, is the City of Peace: Loud anthems, not widows' wail:’ ‘It is not in bellowings chiefs take joy, But in songs of the wars of Fail! ‘Are the men in the streets like Baoignè's chiefs? Great-hearted like us are they? Do they stretch to the poor the ungrudging hand, Or turn they their heads away? ‘Thou man with the chaunt, and thou man with the creed, This thing I demand of thee: My dog, may he pass through the gates of heaven? May my wolf-hound enter free?’ ‘Old man, not the buzzing gnat may pass, Nor sunbeam look in unbidden: The King there sceptred knows all, sees all: From Him there is nothing hidden.’ ‘It never was thus with Fionn, our king! In largess our Fionn delighted: The hosts of the earth came in and went forth Unquestioned, and uninvited!’ ‘Thy words are the words of madness, old man, Thy chieftains had rule one day; Yet a moment of heaven is three times worth The warriors of Eire for aye!’ Then Oiseen uplifted his old white head: Like lightning from hoary skies A flash went forth 'neath the shaggy roofs Low-bent o'er his sightless eyes: ‘Though my life sinks down, and I sit in the dust, Blind warrior and grey-haired man, Mine were they of old, thou priest over bold, Those chiefs of Baoignè's clan!’ And he cried, while a spasm his huge frame shook, ‘Dim shadows like men before me, My father was Fionn, and Oscar my son, Though to-day ye stand vaunting it o'er me!’ Thus raged Oiseen—'mid the fold of Christ, Still roaming old deserts wide In the storm of thought, like a lion old; Though lamblike at last he died. II. THE DEATH OF OSCAR. ‘Sing us once more of Gahbra's fight, Old bard, that fight where fell thy son:’ Thus Patrick spake to vexed Oiseen, And the old man's wrath was gone. ‘Thou of the crosier white! whoe'er Had seen that plain with carnage spread, Or friend or foe, had wept for Eire, And for her princes dead! ‘There lay the arms of mighty chiefs; There kings in death with helms unbound. A field of doom it was; a haunt By deadly spells girt round! ‘Upon his left hand leaned my son: His shield lay broken by his side: His right hand clutched his sword: the blood Rushed from him like a tide. ‘I stayed my spear-shaft on the ground: O'er him I stooped on bended knee: On me my Oscar turned his eyes: He stretched his hand to me. ‘To me my Oscar spake—my son— The dying man, and all but dead: “Thou liv'st! For this I thank the Gods! O father!” thus he said. ‘“Rememberest thou that day we fought Far westward at the Sith of Mor?” Caoilte thus: “I healed thee then, Though deep thy wounds and sore: ‘“No cure remains for wounds like these.”’ Here ceased the lamentable sound;— Five steps Caoilte moved apart; Then dashed him on the ground. ‘My Oscar stared upon his wounds; To fields long past his thoughts took flight: “My son,” I cried, “thou hadst not died If Fionn had ruled the fight!” ‘O Patrick! I have sung thee lays, Emprize of others, or my own; Where he was bravest all were brave; But his, and his alone, ‘The gracious ways, the voice that smiled, The heart so loving and so strong: The women laughed to hear my harp; They wept at Oscar's song! ‘All night we watched the dying man: To staunch his blood we strove in vain: We heard the demon-loaded wind Along the mountain strain. ‘All night we propped him with our spears: To staunch his blood we strove in vain; Till, drenched in falling floods, the moon Went down beyond the plain. ‘Alas! the dawning of that morn, My Oscar's last! With barren glare It flashed along the broken arms And the red pools here and there. ‘Then saw we, pacing from afar, A kingly form, a shape of woe: King Fionn it was that toward us moved With measured footsteps slow: ‘King Fionn himself; and far behind Came many warriors more of Fail, Down-gazing on Baoignè's clan Death-cold, and still, and pale. ‘There lay all dumb the men of might: There, foot to foot, the foemen, strewn Like seaweed lines on stormy shores, Or forests overblown! ‘O! then to hear that cry far borne On gales new-touched with morning frost! As though he heard it not, the king Came, striding o'er that host, ‘Seeking the bodies of his sons: So on he strode through fog and mist; And we to meet him moved; for now That Fionn it was we wist. ‘“All hail to thee, King Fionn! all hail!” He answered naught, but onward passed Until he reached that spot where lay My Oscar sinking fast. ‘“Late, late thou com'st: yet thou art here:” Then answered Fionn, “Alas the day! My reign is done since thou art gone, And all this host is clay.” ‘My Oscar gazed upon his face: He heard the words his grandsire said: He heard, nor spake: his hand down fell And his great spirit fled. ‘Then all the warriors, far and near, Save one that wept, and Fionn, my sire, Three times upraised a cry that rang O'er all the land of Eire. ‘Fionn turned from us his face that hour: We knew that tears adown it crept: Never, except for Bran his hound, The king till then had wept. ‘He shed no tear above his son; Tearless he saw his brother die: He wept to see my Oscar dead And the warriors weeping nigh. ‘This is the tale of Gahbra's fight, Where all the monarchs warred on one; Where they that wrecked him shared his fate, And Erin's day was done. ‘On Gahbra's field the curse came down: Our voice is changed from that of men: We sigh by night: we sigh by day: We learned that lesson then. ‘O! many a prince was laid that day In narrow cairn and lonely cave; But all the far-famed Rath thenceforth Became my Oscar's grave! ‘Patrick, I pray the Lord of Life— Patrick, do thou His grace implore— That death may still my heart ere long: This night my pain is sore.’ III. OISEEN'S YOUTH. ‘Patrick! thy priests do ill to jeer, Not me, but Oscar's self, and Fionn: Wise are they; but the dead are dear: This deed is not well done. ‘Who dares to say the king lies bound By angel hosts in bonds abhorred? Had these lain bound, great Fionn had found And freed them with his sword! ‘Had Fionn but heard thine Eve lament The apple stol'n—the curse on men— For eric apples he had sent, Shiploads threescore and ten! ‘Likewise that Serpent slain had he! Fionn ever said this way was best, To kill the bad that killed should be, And be loving to the rest. Patrick, a pact with thee I make: Because my warriors they deride With thee to heaven my father take, And leave thy priests outside! ‘Patrick, this other boon I crave, That I to thee in heaven may sing Full loud the glories of the brave To thee and Him, thy King!’ ‘Oiseen, in heaven the praises swell To God alone from Soul and Saint:—’ ‘Then, Patrick, I their deeds will tell In a little whisper faint! ‘Who says that Fionn his sentence waits In some dark realm, the thrall of sin? Fionn would have burst that kingdom's gates, Or ruled himself therein!’ ‘Old man, have peace! To warriors true None know what Grace in death is given: Some served that Truth they never knew; Some hail it first in heaven. ‘Old man, for once thy chiefs forget—’ (Thus oft the Saint his rage beguiled): ‘Sing us thine own glad youth, while yet A stripling, or a child.’ ‘O Patrick, glad that time and dear! It wrought no greatness, gained no gain; Not less those things thou long'st to hear Thou shalt not seek in vain. ‘My mother was a princess, turned By magic to a milk-white doe:— Such tale, a wondering child, I learned: True was it? Who can know? ‘I know but this, that yet a boy, I raced beside her like the wind: We heard the hunter's horn with joy, And left the pack behind. ‘A strength was mine that knew no bound, A witless strength that nothing planned: When came the hour, the deed I found Unsought for in my hand. ‘Forth from a cave I stept at Beigh: O'er mountain cliffs the loose clouds rushed: With them I raced, and reached ere they The loud seas sandhill-hushed. ‘By Brandon's Head an eagle brown O'erhung our wave-borne coracle: I hurled at him my lance, and down Like falling stars he fell. ‘On that green shore of Ardrakese I made an untamed horse my slave, And forced him far o'er heaving seas, And reinless rode the wave. ‘Methinks my brow I might have laid Against a bull's, and there and then Have pushed him backward up the glade, And down the rocky glen! ‘So ran my youth through dark and bright In deeds half jest. Their time is gone: The glorious works of thoughtful might For Oscar were and Fionn! ‘Where met the hosts in mirth I fought: My war-fields still with revel rang: My sword with such a God was fraught That while it smote it sang! ‘My spear, unbidden to my hand Leaped, hawk-wise, for the battle's sake: Forth launched, it flashed along the land With music in its wake. ‘I bore a shield so charged and stored With rage and yearnings for the fight, When foes drew near it shook, and roared Like breakers in the night: ‘But when at last the iron feast Of war its hungry heart had stilled, It murmured like a whispering priest Or frothing pail new-filled!’ ‘Say, knew'st thou never fear or awe?’ Thus Patrick; and the Bard replied, ‘Yea, once: for once a man I saw Who—not in battle—died! ‘I sang the things I loved; the fight; The chance inspired that all decides; That pause of death, when Fate and Flight Drag back the battle tides: ‘The swords that blent their lightnings blue; The midnight march; the city's sack: The advancing ridge of spears that threw The levelled sunrise back. ‘And yet my harp could still the storm, Redeem the babe from magic blight, Restore to human heart and form The unhappy spell-bound knight. ‘And some could hear a sobbing hind Among my chords; and some would swear They heard that kiss of branch and wind That lulled the wild-deer's lair! ‘I sang not lusts: where base men thronged I sat not, neither harped for gold: My song no gracious foeman wronged, No woman's secret told. ‘I sang not hate: with healing breath Gladness of heaven my harp-strings flung On bosoms true, but shamed to death False heart, and ruthless tongue. ‘I sang not lies: amid the flocks I sang when sunset flushed the spray, Or when the white moon scaled the rocks And glared upon the bay. ‘My stately music I rehearsed On shadowing cliffs, when, far below, In rolled the moon-necked wave and burst And changed black shores to snow. ‘But now I tread a darker brink: Far down, unfriendlier waters moan: And now of vanished times I think: Now of that bourn unknown. ‘I strike my harp; I make good cheer: Yet scarce myself can catch its sound: I see but phantoms bending near When feasters press around. ‘Say, Patrick of the mystic lore, Shall I, when this old head lies low, My Oscar see, and Fionn, once more, And race beside that Doe?’ IV. OISEEN'S QUESTION. O Patrick, taught by Him, the Unknown, These questions answer ere I die: Why, when the trees at evening moan, Why must an old man sigh? No kinsmen of my stock are they Though reared was I in sylvan cell: Love-whispers once they breathed: this day They mutter but ‘Farewell!’ What mean the floods? Of old they said, ‘Thus, thus, ye chiefs, ye clans, sweep on:’ They whiten still their rocky bed: Those chiefs and clans are gone! What Power is that which daily heaves O'er earth's dark verge the rising sun, As large the Druid Alph believes, As Tork or Mangerton? A woman once in youthful flower Her infant laid upon my knee: What was it shook my heart that hour? I live—O, where is he? What thing is Youth, which speeds so fast? What thing is Life, which lags so long? Trapped, trapped we are by age at last In a net of fraud and wrong! I cheated am by eld—or cheat— Heart-young as leaves in sun that bask: Is that fresh heart a counterfeit, Or this grey shape a mask? Some say 'tis folly to be moved: ‘The dog, he dieth—why not thou?’ They lie! We loved!—ill deeds reproved,— Is Oscar nothing now? O Patrick of the crosier-staff, The wondrous Book, and anthems slow, If thou the riddle know'st but half, Help those who nothing know! Who made the worlds? the soul? Man's race? The man that knoweth, he is man! I, once a prince, will serve in place Clansman of that man's clan! V. OISEEN'S GRATEFUL COUNSEL. ‘Patrick, 'tis right thy house should roof This else unshielded head! Reverence is due to Prince and Bard, To dying men, and dead. ‘Patrick, I think that thou, like me, Descend'st from princely line; And if thy sires were saints, what help? Needs must their ways be thine! ‘Patrick, thy brethren's songs are naught! Thin wails from breasts ill-fed: Nor valour yet, nor kindness throve On lentils and hard bread! ‘Their songs rouse none to gen'rous rage: All Lent they seemed to flow From hearts of hapless men that sinned Some great sin long ago. ‘I judge not such. What man of men Could live man's life aright Who ne'er had learned its best of joys, Full banquet, and free fight? ‘Patrick, I give thee counsel good, Since good thou art:—Each day Feed thrice thy saints with flesh and wine: Then lock them up to pray! ‘Likewise, if reverence thou wouldst win, Take thou good spoil at need! No chief should live on gifts—they least High chiefs of rite and creed! ‘Patrick, I love thy song of One Who fought with fiends for man, Who vanquished Death, and rapt from Hell The old warriors of his clan. ‘That tale is true! The best we think, Or dream, that God can do! Who doubts that legend's truth is fool, Who scoffs it is untrue. ‘But, Patrick, they who know that Truth Should walk in pride and mirth: Why not? Their warriors reign in heaven! Their loved ones of the hearth! ‘I would that all Baoignè's host Had lived to hear thy word: Their swords had made the man who wrought That deed all Erin's Lord! ‘I would that like my Oscar thou Couldst harp—or fight at need; That feast of Fionn's were thine; that Fionn Had shared thy Great One's deed! ‘Patrick! this tangled good and ill Make all man's life perplext: My chiefs were earth's best breed:—I think Thy saints and thou come next!’ VI. OISEEN'S MISGIVINGS. When now Oiseen lay sick, and none Heard in the court, his tread, To Patrick thus he spake, while blew The spring breeze on his bed: ‘Patrick! if this be true, that He, Thy Great One died for man, Right just it were such chief should rule All mankind for his clan. ‘If this be true that He who died For Oscar died, and Fionn, Then gladly would I die for Him, Or kéile Céile, client, dependant, but with rights. of his, live on. ‘Patrick, to me this day there came A thought unthought before, That Oscar's self perchance with years Had grown—like me—heartsore. ‘Patrick, if He thou serv'st should keep My dead son glad and strong Though reft from me, I pledge to Him In heaven my sword and song! ‘For I have seen the sweet face fade, The stately frame grow weak: And I have felt the tear-drop freeze Upon an unkissed cheek. ‘Patrick, there are who shake in age Aghast at sins of youth;— If Faith of thine retrieves the past, That Faith must needs be Truth. ‘For thrice I saw a foul deed done By youthful chiefs in war; And once I heard a traitor lie, Albeit his head was hoar. ‘But woe to priests that say men sinned Who erred but by mischance! My Oscar heard not of thy King— Who blames such ignorance? ‘For their sake whom I loved I trust: That Creed thou sing'st is sound, Though fancies mingled with my songs, False weed from truthfullest ground. ‘But woe to priests who swear that Fionn Lies chained and shamed this day! Burn such with fire, or fling them bound To be the wild-boar's prey! ‘Patrick! I think two men in me For victory strive and cry; Pray thou thy God to help the best And bid the bad one die.’ VII. OISEEN'S VISION. As, dim through snowy flakes, the dawn Peered o'er the moorlands frore, The old, snow-headed Bard, Oiseen, Sat by the convent door. His chin he propped on that clenched hand Of old in battles feared: And like a silver flood far-kenned Down streamed to earth his beard. That sun his eyes could see no more Their thin lids loved to feel: It rose; and on his cheek a tear Began to uncongeal. Then slowly thus he spake: ‘Three times This thought has come to me, Patrick, that I am older thrice Than I am famed to be: ‘For on the ruins of that house, Once stately to behold, Where feasted Fionn the king, there sighs A wood of alders old. ‘And on my Oscar's grave three elms Have risen, and mouldered three; And by my father's cairn the oak Is now a hollow tree. ‘Patrick, of me they noised a tale, That down beneath a lake A hundred years I lived, unchanged, For a Faery Lady's sake: ‘They said that, home when I returned, The men I loved were dead; And that the whiteness fell that hour Like snow upon my head. ‘That was a dream of mine in youth— The witless deemed it true: Far other dream was mine in age: A dream that no man knew. ‘For though I sang of things loved well, I hid the things loved best:— Patrick, to thee that later dream This day shall be confessed. ‘On Gahbra's field my Oscar fell: Last died my father, Fionn: The wind went o'er their grassy mounds; I heard it, and lived on. ‘I loved no more the lark by Lee, Nor yet the battle-cry; For that cause in a dell, one day, I laid me down to die. ‘The cold went on into my heart: Methought that I lay dead: Yet knew I that two angels waved Their wings above my head. ‘They spake, “This man, for Erin's sake Shall tarry here an age— Till He Who died to Erin comes— In this still hermitage: ‘“That so, ere yet that great old time Is wholly gone and past, Her manlier with her saintly day May blend in bridal fast. ‘“And since of deadly deeds he sang Above him we will sing The Death that saved: and we from him Will keep the gadfly's sting. ‘“For him an age, for us an hour, Here, like a cradled child, Shall sleep the man whose hand was red, Whose heart was undefiled.” ‘Patrick! That vision, was it truth? Or fancy's mocking gleam? That I should tarry till He came— 'Twas not, 'twas not a dream! ‘And wondrous is mine age, I know; For whiter than the thorn Was this once-honoured head, ere yet The men now white were born: ‘And on my Oscar's grave three elms Have risen, and mouldered three; And on my father's grave, the oak Is now a hollow tree. Then said the monks, ‘His brain is hurt:’ But Patrick said, ‘They lie! Thou God that lov'st thy grey-haired child, Would I for him might die!’ And Patrick cried, ‘Oiseen! the thirst Of God is in thy breast! He who has dealt thy heart the wound Ere long will give it rest!’ VIII. OISEEN'S GOOD CONFESSION. A month went by, but still Oiseen, Like seas that cannot rest, Made change from calm to storm, nor e'er God's Truth aright confessed. For still he mingled scoff with praise, And clamoured oft that Eire Were heaven to him, if Oscar trod Her mountains—and his sire. The end drew near. Death-still he lay Upon his wolf-skin bed; And now he smiled in sleep, and now Murmured of warriors dead. God's Saint drew near; bent o'er him; spake: ‘A fair Child died one day: Four weeks had passed, yet, changeless still, Like child asleep he lay. ‘They could not hide him in the ground Though hand and heart were chill, For round his lips the smile avouched That soul was in him still. ‘Then lo! a Man of God came by And stood beside the bier, And spake, “A Pagan house is this, And yet a Saint lies here! ‘“God shaped this Child His praise to sing To a blind and Pagan race; And till that song is sung, in heaven He may not see God's Face.” ‘The Man of God his censer took, Above that Child he bowed; With an Altar-coal he touched its tongue And the dead Child sang aloud. ‘The Child sat up that dead had been, And singing praised his Lord; And all the Pagans knelt around And Christ, their God, adored. ‘Oiseen! like larks beside thy Lee So loud he sang that hymn: And straight baptized he was, and died; And, dead, his face grew dim. ‘So then, since Christ had caught to heaven The fair soul washed from sin, A little grave they dug, and laid The little Saint therein. ‘And ever as fell the night, that grave Shone like the Shepherds' star, With happy beam, and homeward drew Some wanderer from afar. ‘Oiseen! thy Land is like that Child! Thou call'st her dead—thy Land— For cold is Fionn, thy sire; and he, He was her strong right hand! ‘And cold is Oscar now, thy son; Her mighty heart was he: Oiseen! let dead at last be dead; Let living, living be! ‘Her great old Past is gone at last: Her lordlier Future waits: Yet entrance never can she find Till Faith unbars the gates. ‘Son of thy Country's mightiest King! Bard of her Royal Race! Thee, too, God's Altar-Fire hath touched: Show thou to Eire His Face! ‘Prince of thy country's songful choir! Thou wert her golden tongue! Sing thou her new song, “I believe,” Give thou to God her song!’ Then suddenly that old man stood, And made his arms a cross: And light was his from heaven that changed All earth to dust and dross: And, pierced by beams from those two Hands Of Jesus crucified, His Erin of two thousand years Held forth her hands and died: For all her sceptres by a Reed He saw that hour o'erborne; And all her crowns he saw go down Before that Crown of Thorn. As shines the sun through snowy haze Oiseen's white head forth shone: ‘In God the Father I believe,’ He sang, ‘and Mary's Son:’ And, onward as the swan-chaunt swept Adown the Creed's broad flood, In radiance waxed his face, as though He saw the Face of God. Then Patrick with his wondering monks, Knelt down, and said, ‘Amen,’ While slowly dropped a sun that ne'er Saw that white head again. The rite complete, the old man sank, And turned him on his side: Next morning, as the Lauds began, ‘My Son,’ he said, and died. LEGENDS OF IRELAND'S HEROIC AGE. THE FORAY OF QUEEN MEAVE; OR, ‘THE TAIN BO CUALGNÉ.’ A FRAGMENT OF AN ANCIENT IRISH EPIC. TO MY FRIEND SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON THIS POEM IS DEDICATED, IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR ‘CONGAL,’ ‘CONARY,’ AND MANY POEMS BESIDE, THAT ILLUSTRATE ARIGHT THE LEGENDS OF ANCIENT IRELAND. PROLOGUE. Senchan, the king of bards, when centuries six Had flowered and faded since the Birth Divine, Summoned in synod all the island bards, Demanding: ‘Is there who can yet recite That first of Erin's songs, “The Tain”?’ Not one Could sing it, save in fragments. Then arose Marbhan, and spake: ‘Send prayer to Erin's Saints That, bowed o'er Fergus’ grave, they lift their hands For Erin at her need.’ Five Saints obeyed And o'er that venerable spot three days Fasting made prayer while knelt the bards around. Then on the third day as the sun uprose Behold! a purple mist engirt that grave; And from it, fair as rainbow backed by cloud, Shone out a kingly Phantom robed in green, With red-brown locks, close clustered, drenched in dew, And golden crown, and golden-hilted sword;— His hand was on it. They who saw that Shape Well knew him, Fergus Roy, the Exile-King. Gracious as in the old days, that king rehearsed The Tale so long desired, though many an age, And that grey empire of departed Souls, Had quelled at last the strong ones of that strain, Record half jest, half earnest. Marbhan spoke Once more: ‘Lest Erin lose again this Tale Through fraud of demons or all-wasting time, Amid you Saints elect some scribe, their best, And pray that scribe to write it.’ Straight, with help It may be, of the bards, Saint Kiaran wrote The Heroic Song on parchment fine, the skin Of one he loved, his ‘little heifer grey’ That gave the book its name. Six centuries passed; Then in Saint Kiaran's House at Clonmacnoise That book was found, and on it: ‘Reader, here Are histories old with later fables blent, Fancies full fair with idle Pagan vaunts: Now therefore, since old things have in them worth And teach by what they hold and what they lack, Whoso shall read this book, and know to choose 'Twixt Good and Ill, my blessing on him rest!’ BOOK I. THE CAUSE OF THE GREAT WAR. ARGUMENT. Meave, Queen of Connacht, Now Connaught. and Ailill her husband, waking one morning fall into a disputation, each claiming to be the worthier of the two, and the wealthier. Their lords decide that the king and queen are great and happy alike in all things save one only, namely, that Ailill possesses the far-famed white Bull, Fionbannah. Meave hearing that Conor Conchobar, King of Uladh, Now Ulster. boasts a black Bull mightier yet, is fain to purchase it, but cannot prevail so far. She therefore declares war against Uladh. There meets her Faythleen the Witch, who prophesies calamity, but promises that in aid of Meave she will breathe over the realm of Uladh a spirit of Imbecility. This she does; yet Cuchullain, unaided, afflicts the whole army of Meave by exploits which to him are but sports. Fergus, the exiled King of Uladh, narrates to Meave the high deeds of Cuchullain wrought in his childhood. In Cruachan, old Connacht's palace pile, Dwelt Meave the queen, haughtiest of woman's kind, A warrioress untamed that made her will The measure of the world. The all-conquering years Conquered not her: the strength of endless prime Lived in her royal tread and breast and eye A life immortal. Queenly was her brow; Fulgent her eye; her countenance beauteous, save When wrath o'erflamed its beauty. With her dwelt Ailill her husband, trivial man and quaint, And early old. He had not chosen her: She chose a consort who should rule her not, And tossed him to her throne. In youth her lord Was Conor Conchobar, great Uladh's king: She had not found him docile to her will, And to her sire returned. The August morn Had trailed already on the stony floor Its fiery beam when, laughing, Ailill woke: He woke, awakened by a sound that shook The forest dews to earth, Fionbannah's roar, That snow-white Bull, the wonder of the age, Who, born amid the lowlands of the queen, Yet, grown to strength, o'er-leaped her bound and roamed Thenceforth the leaner pastures of the king, For this cause, that his spirit scorned to live In female vassalage. That tale recalling King Ailill laughed: his laughter roused the queen: She woke in wrath: to assuage her Ailill spake: ‘Happy and blest that dame whose lord is sage! Thy fortunes, wife of mine, began that day I called thee spouse!’ To him the queen, ‘My sire Was Erin's Ard-Righ! Chief King. He had daughters six: I, Meave, of these was fairest and most famed! This Cruachan was mine before we met; And all the Island's princes sued my hand. I spurned their offers! I required three things— A warrior proved, since great at arms am I; A liberal hand, since lavish I of gifts; A man not jealous, since, in love as war, There where I willed I ever cast mine eyes. These merits three were yours: I beckoned to you: Dowered you with ingots thicker than your wrist; Made you a king, or kingling. What of that? I might have chosen a better! Yea, I count My greatness more than yours!’ With treble shrill Ailill replied, ‘What words are these, my queen? My father was a king; my brothers kings! My hoards are higher heaped than yours; my meads More deep, more rich!’ Then loudly stormed the queen:— In rushed her lords, and stood, a senate grave, Circling the couch: and while, each answering each, Ailill and Meave set forth in order due The treasures either boasted, kine, or sheep, Rich cornfield, jewelled robe, or gem-wrought car, Careful they weighed the lists in equal scale And 'twixt them found in value difference none. Doubtful they stood. Anon rolled forth once more Fionbannah's roar; and, clapping loud his hands, King Ailill shouted, ‘Mine, not thine, that Bull! Through him my treasure passes thine, my queen! My worth exceeds thy worth!’ At once forth stepped Mac Roth, old Connacht's herald, with this word: ‘Great queen, the King of Uladh boasts a Bull Lordlier than ours, a broader bulk, and black, Black as the raven's wing! In Daré's charge That marvel bides, the Donn Cualgné named Because his lowings shake Cualgné's shore, The southern bound of Uladh. Privilege He hath that neither witch nor demon tempt That precinct where he harbours.’ Meave exclaimed: ‘Fly hence, Mac Roth! Take with thee golden store, Rich garments, chariots gemmed: bid Daré choose; But bring me back that Bull!’ Three days had passed: Then by the tower of Daré stood Mac Roth And blew his horn; and Daré's sons with speed Flung the gate wide. The herald entered in And spake his message. Proudly Daré mused, ‘Great Meave my friendship sues;’ and made a feast, And, when the wine had warmed him, spake: ‘Mac Roth! Cualgné's Donn is Conor's Bull, not mine: Yet, though the king should hurl me outcast forth, To Meave that Bull shall go and bide a year. Tell her the Donn is manlike in his mind, And not like Bulls. Long summer eves he stands, Or paces stately up the mead and down, Eyeing the racing youths, or glad at heart Listening the music.’ Thus he pledged his faith. But Daré's sons at midnight, each to each, Whispered, ‘The king will chase us from the realm! He hates Queen Meave, and well he loves the Donn;’ And stood next morn beside their sire, and spake: ‘Mac Roth is gone a hunting: ere he went He sware that you had yielded him the Donn Fearing his sword. ’Then Daré's heart was changed, And loud he sware by all his swearing gods: ‘Cualgné's Donn shall ne'er consort with Meave, Nor with her kine:’ and on his gate he set The castle's Fool waiting Mac Roth's return, And charged him with this greeting: ‘Back to Meave! Thy queen she is, not Uladh's! Bid her know Our Donn and we revere Fionbannah's choice, Her Bull, that leaped her gate and swam her flood, Spurning the female rule!’ Then turned Mac Roth His car; and sideway shook one hand irate; And lashed the steeds, and reached great Cruachan, And told his tale; and straight on them that heard Like lightning fell the battle rage. The queen Sent forth her heralds, east, and west, and south, Summoning her great allies. Erin, that day Save Uladh only, stood conjoined with Meave, Great kings, and warriors named from chiefs of old Sons of Milesius; for King Conor's craft And that proud onset of the Red-Branch Knights Year after year had galled their hearts. 'Twas come! The day of vengeance! In their might they rose From Eyrus' vales to utmost Cahirnane, From Oileen Arda on to Borda Lu, And where the loud wave breaks on Beara's isle; And by the hallowed banks of Darvra's lake Where, changed to swans, the Children Four of Lir, Dowerless on earth, their home the homeless waves, Darkling yet gladdening gloomier hearts with light, And sad yet solaced through one conquering hope, By song had vanquished sorrow. From the West Came Inachall, and Adarc. Eiderkool Marched, ever shrilling songs and shaking spears: And, mightier far, with never slumbering hearts And eyes that stared through long desire of home, Uladh's three thousand exiles, driven far forth When Conor Conchobar, trampling his pledge, Slaughtered the sons of Usnach. At their head Rode Fergus, Uladh's King ere traitor yet Had filched its royal crown; and by his side, Faithful in exile, Cormac Conlinglas, King Conor's bravest son. That host the queen To Ai led, where Ai's four great plains Shine in the rising and the setting sun, Gold-green, with all their flag-flowers, meres, and streams: There planted she her camp; thence ever rang Neighing of horse, and tempest song of bard, And graver voice of prophet and of seer Who ceased not, day or night, for fifteen days From warnings to the people, ‘Be ye one;’— Yet one the people were not. Meave the while, Resting upon those great and growing hosts Her widening eyes, rejoiced within, and clutched The sceptre-staff with closer grasp, and heaved Higher her solid, broad, imperial breast, Amorous of battle nigh at hand. Yet oft, Listening those bickerings in her camp she frowned: For still the chieftains strove; and one, a king Briarind, had tongue so sharp, where'er he moved A guard was round him ranged lest spleen of his Should set the monarchs ravening each on each. ‘The hand of Fergus,’ mused she, ‘that alone Might solder yonder mass. Men note in him His front, his voice, his stature, and his step, The one time King of Uladh. Held he rule— He shall not for my will endures it not! He props my war because, long years our guest, His honour needs not less; he marches with us Athirst for vengeance and his native land, Yet scoffs our cause, and sent, spurning surprise, To Uladh challenge loud.’ Again she mused, ‘A man love-worthy if he loved again!— At best 'twould be to him a moment's sport! The battle and the stag-hunt, these alone, He counts a prince's pastimes!’ Sudden from heaven Eclipse there fell on Ai's spacious plains, And shadow black; these noting, Meave revolved That dread ‘Red Branch’ in act and counsel one, Order world-famed of Uladh's chivalry, And, brooding thus, with inner eye she saw No longer men but skeletons of men Innumerable in intertangled mass Burthening the fields. Then panic-struck, she cried: ‘On to Moytura where the prophet dwells;’ And straight her charioteer the horses smote And northward turned their heads: and lo, what time The noontide sun with keenest splendour blazed, Right opposite upon the chariot's beam There sat a wondrous woman phantom-faced, Singing and weaving. Shapely was that head Bent o'er her web, while back the sun-like hair Streamed on the wind. One hand upreared a sword: Seven chains fell from it. Sea-blue were her eyes, And berry-red her scornful lip; her cheek White as the snow-drift of a single night; Her voice like harp-strings when the harper's hand Half drowns their pathos. Close as bark to tree The azure robe clung to that virgin form Sinewy and long, and reached the shining feet. Then spake the queen: ‘What see'st thou in that web?’ And she, ‘I see a kingdom's destinies; And they are like a countenance dashed with blood; Faythleen am I, the Witch.’ To her the queen: ‘I bid thee say what see'st thou in my host, Faythleen, the Witch!’ And Faythleen answered slow: ‘The hue of blood: sunset on sunset charged.’ Then fixed that Wild One on the North her eyes, And Meave made answer, ‘In those eyes I see The fates they see; great Uladh's realm full-armed, And all that Red Branch Order as one man.’ Faythleen replied, ‘One man alone I see; One man, yet mightier than a realm in arms! That Watch-Hound watching still by Uladh's gate Is mightier thrice than Uladh: on his brow Spring-tide sits throned; yet ruin loads his hand. If e'er Cuchullain rides in Uladh's van Flee to thy hills and isles!’ Meave bit her lip; But wildly sang the Witch: ‘Faythleen am I, Thy People's patron 'mid the Powers unseen: Beware that youth invisible for speed, Who hears that whisper none beside can hear, Sees what none other sees; before whose eye The wild beast cowers, subdued! Beware that youth Slender as maid, whose stature in the fight Rises gigantic. Gamesome he and mild; To women reverent and the hoary hair; Nor alms he stints nor incense to the Gods; But when from heaven the anger on him breaks Pity he knows for none. No pact with him! Return with speed and march to-morrow morn: The clan of Cailitin shall yield thee aid, That magic clan which fights with poisoned darts. To Uladh I, above her realm to spread Mantle of darkness, and a mind that errs, And powerlessness, and shame.’ Due north she sped, Far fleeting, wind up-borne, 'twixt hill and cloud, To Uladh's cliffs, and thence with prone descent Sank to the myriad-murmuring sea wine-dark, And whispered to the Genii of the deep, Her sisters:—then from ocean's breast there rose A mist, no larger than a dead man's shroud, That, slowly widening, spread o'er Uladh's realm Mantle of darkness, and an erring mind, And powerlessness, and shame. The queen returned, And reached her host what time the sunset glare With omnipresent splendour girt it round, Concourse immortalised. Thereon she gazed High standing in her chariot, spear in hand: Her, too, that army saw, and raised the shout. But Fergus, as she passed him, spake: ‘Not yet Know'st thou my Uladh, nor the Red Branch Knights; And one man is there mightier thrice than they.’ Meantime within Murthemné's land its lord Cuchullain, musing like a listening hound, For many a rumour filled that time the air, Sat in remote Dûn Dalgan Now Dundalk. all alone, Chief city of his realm. On Uladh's verge Southward that lesser realm dependent lay Girt by a racing river. Silent long He watched: at last he heard a sound like wind In woods remote; and earthward bowed his head; And said, ‘That sound is distant thirty leagues, And huge that host;’ then bade prepare his car, And southward sped, counsel to hold as wont With Faythleen nigh to Tara. Eve grew dim When lo! a chariot from the woods emerged In swift pursuit: an old man urged the steeds, A grey old man that chattered evermore With blinking eyes that ceased not from amaze Now to himself, now to his charioteer. That sight displeased Cuchullain: ne'ertheless He stayed his course; and Saltain soon drew nigh, Clamouring, ‘O son—and when was son like thee— Forsake not thou thy father! In old time, Then when some God had laid on me his hand, Dectara, my wife, immured me in my house, Year after year, and weighed the lessening dole: But thou, to manhood grown, though even to her Reverent, didst pluck her from that place usurped, Lifting thy poor old father.’ At that word Cuchullain left his car, and kissed his sire, And soothed his wandering wits with meat and wine; And spake dissembling, ‘Lo, these mantles warm! For thee it was I stored them! Night is near; Lie down and rest.’ Thus speaking, with both hands He spread them deftly forth, and Saltain slept: Then, tethering first the horses of his sire, Lastly his own, upon the chill, wet grass He likewise lay, and slept not. On, at dawn They drave; but Faythleen, witch perverse of will That oft through spleenful change her purpose slew, Had broken tryst; and northward they returned. That day Cuchullain clomb a tree-girt rock And kenned beyond the forest's roof a host Innumerable, the standards of Queen Meave, And Fergus, and the great confederate kings. The warrior eyed them long with bitter smile; He spake few words: ‘At fifty thousand men I count them.’ To his father then he turned: ‘Haste to Emania! Bid the Red Branch Knights Attend me in Murthemné. I till then Hang on the invaders' flank, a fiery scourge.’ Saltain made answer: ‘Be it! northward I: But Dectara, thy mother and my wife, I will not see till thou art by my side; For dreadful are her eyes as death or fate; And many deem her mad.’ He spake, and drave Northward; nor ceased from chatterings all day long, Since, like a Poplar, vocal was the man Not less than visible. Meantime his son Took counsel in his heart, and made resolve To skirt in homeward course that eastern sea, The wood primeval 'twixt him and the foe, Still sallying night and day through alley and glade And taming thus their pride. Three days went by: Then stood Cuchullain where great wood-ways met; And lo! betwixt four yews a warrior's grave, The pillar-stone above it! O'er that stone In mirthful mood he twined an osier wreath, Cyphering thereon his name in Ogham signs: For thus he said: ‘On no man unawares Fall I, but warned.’ The hostile host approached, And, halting stood in wonder at that wreath; Yet none could spell the Ogham. Last drew nigh Fergus, and read it: on him fell that hour Memories full dear, and loud he sang and long; He sang a warrior's praise: yet named him not; He sang: ‘From name of man to name of beast A warrior changed: then mightiest grew of men!’ And, as he sang, the cheek of Meave grew red. Next morn Neara's sons outsped the rest Car-borne with brandished spears, and, ere the dew Was lifted, came to where Cuchullain sat Beneath an oak, sporting with black-birds twain That followed him for aye. Toward the youths He waved his hand: ‘Away, for ye are young!’ In answer forth they flung their spears: he caught them, And snapt them on his knee; next, swift as fire, Sprang on the twain, and slew them with his sword, One blow:—anon he loosed their horses' bits, And they, with madness winged, rejoined the host, Bearing those headless bulks. Forth looked the queen; Beheld; and, trembling, cried, ‘It might have been Orloff, my son!’ That eve, at banquet ranged The warriors questioned Fergus: ‘Who is best Among the Uladh chiefs?’ Ere answer came King Conor's son self-exiled, Conlinglas, Upleaping cried, ‘Cuchullain is his name! Cuchullain! From his childhood man was he! On Eman Macha Armagh. ever was his thought, Its walls, its bulwarks, and its Red Branch Knights, The wonder of the world.’ Then told the prince How, when his mother mocked his zeal, that child Fared forth alone, with wooden sword and shield, And fife, and silver ball; and how he hurled His little spears before him as he ran, And caught them ere they fell: and how, arrived, He spurned great Eman's gates, and scaled its wall, And lighted in the pleasaunce of the king, His mother's brother, Conor Conchobar; And how the noble youths of all that land There trained in warlike arts, had on him dashed With insult and with blows: and how the child This way and that had hurled them, while the king Who sat that hour with Fergus, playing chess, Gazed from his turret wondering. Next he told How to that child, Setanta first, there fell Cuchullain's nobler name. ‘To Eman near There dwelt an armourer, Cullain was his name, That earliest rose, and latest with his forge Reddened the night: mail-clad in might of his The Red Branch Knights forth rode: the bard, the chief Claimed him for friend. One day, when Conor's self Partook his feast, the armourer held discourse: “The Gods have made my house a house of fame; The craftsmen grin and grudge because I prosper; The forest bandits hunger for my goods, Yea, and would eat mine anvil if they might— Trow ye what saves me, Sirs? A Hound is mine, Each eve I loose him; lion-like is he; The blood of many a rogue is on his mouth; The bravest, if they hear him bay far off, Flee like a deer!” Setanta's shout rang loud That moment at the gate, and, with it blent, The baying of that hound! “The boy is dead,” King Conor cried in horror. Forth they rushed— There stood he, bright and calm, his rigid hands Clasping the dead hound's throat! They wept for joy: The armourer wept for grief. “My friend is dead! My friend that kept my house and me at peace: My friend that loved his lord!” Setanta heard Then first that cry forth issuing from the heart Of him whose labour wins his children's bread, That cry he honours yet. Red-cheeked he spake: “Cullain! unwittingly I did thee wrong! I make amends. I, child of kings, henceforth Abide, thy watch-hound, warder of thy house.” Thenceforth the “Hound of Cullain” Cu in Irish means “hound.” was his name, And Cullain's house well warded.’ Stern of brow The queen arose: ‘Enough of fables, lords! Drink to the victory! Ere yon moon is dead We knock at gates of Eman.’ High she held The crimson goblet. Instant, felt ere heard, Vibration strange troubled the moonlit air; A long-drawn hiss o'er-ran it: then a cry, Death-cry of warrior wounded to the death. They rose: they gazed around: Cuchullain stood High on a rock. The swift one said in heart, ‘I will not slay her; yet her pride shall die!’ Again that hiss: instant the golden crown Fell from her head! In wrath she glared around;— Once more that hiss long-drawn, and in her hand The goblet, shivered, stood! She cast it down; She cried, ‘Since first I sat, a queen new-crowned, Never such ignominy, or spleen of scorn Hath mocked my greatness!’ Fiercely rushed the chiefs Against the aggressor. Through the high-roofed woods They saw him distant like a falling star Kindling the air with speed. Ere long, close by He stood with sling high holden. At its sound Ever some great one died! The morrow morn Cuchullain reached a lawn: tall autumn grass Whitened within it; but the Beech trees round Were russet brown, the thorn-brakes berry-flushed: Passing, he raised his spear and launched it forth Earthward: there stood it buried in the soil Half-way, and quivering. Loud Cuchullain laughed, And cried, ‘It quivers like the tail of swine Gladdened by acorn feast!’ then drew he rein And with one sword-stroke felled a youngling Birch And bound it to that spear, and on its bark Silvery and smooth, graved with his lance's point In Ogham characters the words, ‘Beware! Unless thou know'st what hand this Ogham traced Twine yonder berries 'mid thy young bride's locks, But spare to tempt that hand!’ An hour passed by And Meave had reached the spot. Chief following chief Drew near in turn; yet none could drag from earth That spear deep-buried. Fergus laughed: ‘Let be, Connacians! Task is here for Uladh's hand!’ Then, standing in his car, he clutched the spear And tugged it thrice. The third time 'neath his feet Down crashed the strong-built chariot to the ground. He laughed! The queen in anger cried, ‘March on!’ The host advanced, disordered. Foremost drave Orloff, Meave's son. That morning he had wed A maid, the loveliest in his mother's court, And yearned to prove his valour in her eyes. Sudden he came to where Cuchullain stood Pasturing his steeds with grass and flower forth held In wooing, dallying hand. Cuchullain said, ‘The queen's son this! I will not harm the youth,’ And waved him to depart. That stripling turned, Yet, turning, hurled his javelin. As it flew Cuchullain caught it; poised it; hurled it home: It pierced that youth from back to breast; he fell Dead on the chariot's floor. The steeds rushed on Wind-swift; and reached the camp. There sat the queen Throned in her car, listening the host's applause: In swoon she fell, and lay as lie the dead. Next morn again the invaders marched, nor knew What foe was he who, mocking, thinned their ranks, Trampled their pride; who, lacking spear and car, Viewless by day, by night a fleeting fire, Dragged down their mightiest, in the death cry shrill Drowning the revel. Fergus knew the man, Fergus alone; nor yet divulged his name, Oft muttering, ‘These be men who fight for Bulls— I war to shake a Perjurer from his throne, And count no brave man foe.’ Again at feast Ailill made question of the Red Branch Knights; Fergus replied, ‘Cuchullain is their best: I taught him arms! Hear of his Knighting Day! ‘Northward of Eman lies a pleasaunce green: The Arch-Druid, Cathbad, gazer on the stars, While there the youths contended, beckoned one And whispered, “Happy shall that stripling prove Knighted this day! Glorious his life, though brief!” That hour Cuchullain stood beyond the wall South of the city, yet he heard that whisper! He heard, and cried, “Enough one day of life If great my deeds, and helpful!” Swift of foot He sped to Conor. “I demand, great king, Knighthood this day, and knighthood at thy hand.” But Conor laughed: “Not fifteen years are thine! Withhold thyself yet three.” That self-same hour Old Cathbad entered, and his Druid clan, And spake: “King Conor! by my bed last night Great Macha stood, the worship of our race, Our strength in realms unseen. ‘Arise,’ she said; ‘To Conor speed: to him report my will: That youth knighted this day is mine Elect! I, Macha, send him forth!’ ‘“She spake and passed: Trembled the place like cliffs o'er ocean caves: Like thunder underground I heard her wheels In echoes slowly dying.” ‘Fixed and firm King Conor stood. Sternly he made reply: “Queen Macha had her day and ruled: far down Doubtless this hour she rules, or rules aloft: I rule in Eman and this Uladh realm: I will not knight a stripling!” Prophet-like Up-towered old Cathbad, and his sons black-stoled. This way and that they rolled prophetic bolts Three hours, and brake with warnings from the stars And mandates from the synod of the Gods, The king's resolve. At last he cried, “So be it! Since Gods, like men, grow witless, be it so! The worse for Eman, and great Macha's land— Stand forth, my sister's son!” He spake and bound The Geisa, and the edicts, and the vows Of that dread Red Branch Order on the boy, And gave him sword and lance. ‘An eye star-keen That boy upon them fixed, and, each on each, Smote them. They snapt in twain. Laughing, he cried, “Good art thou, Uncle mine; but these are base: I need a warrior's weapons!” Conor signed; Then brought his knaves ten swords, and lances ten: Cuchullain eyed them each and snapt them all, The concourse marvelling. “Varlets,” cried the king, “Bring forth my arms of battle!” These in turn Cuchullain proved: they brake not. Up they dragged A battle-car. Cuchullain leaped therein: With feet far set he spurned its brazen floor That roared and sank in fragments. Chariots twelve Successive thus he vanquished. “Uncle mine, Good art thou,” cried the youth; “but these are base!” King Conor signed, “My car of battle!” Leagh The charioteer forth brought it with the steeds: Cuchullain proved that war-car and it stood. Careless he spake: “So, well! The car will serve! Abide ye my return.” ‘He shook the reins: He called the horses by their names well-known: He dashed through Eman's gateway as a storm: Far off a darksome wood and darksome tower Frowned over Mallok's wave: therein abode Three bandit chieftains, foes to man: well pleased Those bandits eyed the on-rushing car, and youth, Exulting in their prey. That youth, arrived, Summoned those three to judgment: forth they thronged, They and their clan: he slew them with his sling, The three: and severed with his sword their heads, And fixed them on the chariot's front. His mood Changed then to mirthful: fleeter than the wind Six stags went by him, stateliest of the herd; Afoot he chased them, caught them, bound them fast Behind the chariot rail. Birds saw he next, White as a foam-wreath of their native sea, Spotting the glebe new turned. A net lay near: He caged them; next he tied them to his car Wide-winged, and wailing loud. To Eman's towers Returned he last with laughter: at its gate The king, the chiefs, grey Druids, maids red-cloaked, Agape to see him; on his chariot's front The grim heads of those bandits; in its rear Those stags wide-horned; and, high o'erhead the birds!’ The laughter ceased; then spake King Conor's son; ‘Recount the wonder of those fairy steeds That drag Cuchullain's war-car!’ Fergus then, Despite Queen Meave, who plaited still her robe With angry hectic hand, the tale began. ‘Cuchullain paced the herbage thin that clothes Slieve Fuad's summit. On that airy height A wan lake glittered, whitening in the blast; Pale plains were round it. From beneath that lake Emerged a horse foam-white! Cuchullain saw, And straightway round that creature's neck high-held Locked his lithe arms, and lightly leaped upon him. That courser baffled clothed his strength with speed: From cliff to cliff he sped; cleared at a bound Inlet, and rocky rift: nor stayed his course, Men say, till he had circled Erin's Isle: Panting then lay he, on his conqueror's knee Resting his head; thenceforth that conqueror's friend, His “Liath Macha.” Gentle-souled is she, “Sangland,” the wild one's comrade. As the night Sank on those huge red-berried woods of Yew Lough Darvra's girdle, from the ebon wave She issued, darker still. Softly she paced, As though with woman's foot, the grassy marge In violets diapered, and laid her head Upon Cuchullain's shoulder. In his wars Emulous those mated marvels drag his car: In peace he yokes them never.’ Fergus rose: ‘Night wanes,’ he said, ‘and tasks await my hand:’ Passing the throne he whispered thus the queen, ‘The Hound of Uladh is your visitant Both day and night.’ The cheek of Meave grew pale. BOOK II. THE DEEDS OF CUCHULLAIN. ARGUMENT. Fergus is sent to Cuchullain with gifts, and requires him to forsake King Conor. This he will not do, yet consents to forbear Meave's host till she has reached the border of Uladh, the queen engaging that the warfare shall then be restricted to a combat between himself and a single champion sent against him day by day. Each day Meave's champion is slain. Cailitin, lord of the Magic Clan, counsels Meave to send against Cuchullain his best-loved friend Ferdïa; yet she sends, instead, Lok Mac Favesh. When he, too, falls, Cailitin and his twenty-seven sons, all magicians, fling themselves upon Cuchullain to slay him. Cuchullain slays them. The Mor Reega, the War-Goddess of the Gael, prophesies to him that there yet awaits him the greatest of his trials. After ninety days of combat Cuchullain's father brings him tidings that all Uladh lies bound under a spell of Imbecility. Thus ever day by day, and night by night, Through strength of him that 'mid the royal host Passed, and re-passed like thought, the bravest fell; For ne'er against the inglorious or the small Cuchullain raised his hand. Then Ailill spake: ‘Let Fergus seek that champion in the woods, Gift-laden, and withdraw him from his king:’ But Fergus answered, ‘Sue and be refused! That great one loves his country. Heard ye never How when King Conor's sin, that forfeit pledge Plighted with Usnach's sons, had left the Accursèd Crownless, and Eman's bulwarks in the dust, Her elders on Cuchullain worked, what time He came my work of vengeance to complete? They said, “Cuchullain loves his land o'er all! The man besides, though terrible to foes, Is tender to the weak. Through Eman's streets Send ye proclaim, ‘Will any holy Maid To save the city take her station sole On yonder bridge, at parting of the ways, That city's Emblem-Victim, robed in black Down from her girdle to the naked feet; Above that girdle this alone—the chains Of Eman's gate, circling that virgin throat And down at each side streaming? It may be That dread one will relent, pitying in her Great Uladh's self despoiled of robe and crown, Her raiment bonds and shame.’” Of Eman's maids But one, the best and purest, gave consent: Alone she stood at parting of the ways: While near and nearer yet that war-car drew Wide-eyed she stood, death-pale: it stopped: she spake: “Eman, thy Mother, stands a widow now, Despoiled of crown, her raiment bonds and shame; And many a famished babe that wrought no ill Lies 'mid her ruins wailing.” To the left The warrior turned his steeds. The land was saved.’ Then spake the kings confederate: ‘Hard albeit That task, to draw Cuchullain from his charge, Seek him, and proffer terms!’ Fergus next morn Made way through those sea-skirting woods, and cried Three times, ‘Setanta’; and Cuchullain heard And knew that voice, and, beaming, issued forth, And clasped his ancient master round the neck, And led him to his sylvan cell. Therein Long time they held discourse of ancient days Heaven-fair through mist of years. The youthful host Set forth their rural feast, whate'er the woods And they that in them dwelt, swine-herds, and hinds, Yielded, their best: nor lacked it minstrel strain, Bird-song by autumn chilled, that brake through boughs Lit by unwarming sunshine. Banquet o'er, Fergus disclosed the terms of Meave, and gifts By her and Ailill sent. Cuchullain rose And curtly answered, ‘Never will I break My vow; nor wrong the land; nor sell my king:’ Fergus too royal was to hear surprised, Or grieved, his friend's resolve, nor touched again Upon that pact unworthy. Happier themes Succeeded, mirthful some. Of these the last Made sport of Ailill. Fergus spake: ‘One night I sped to Meave's pavilion swift of foot; War-tidings wait not. Ailill from afar Furtively followed, stung by jealous spleen. The queen had passed into the inner tent; I sought her there. In the outer Ailill marked My sword, that morning thither sent, a loan, For Meave had vowed to out-brave its hilt with gems Blazoning her zone. His wrath was changed to joy! He snatched it up; he cried, “Hail, forfeit mine! Hail Eric just! The fine exacted for various offences by the Brehon law.” and laughed his childish laugh. Since then he neither frowns on me nor smiles: He will not let me rule his foolish kings; Yet, deeming still my sword a charm 'gainst fate, Wears it. An apter one I keep for him: One day 'twill raise a laugh!’ In graver mood At parting Fergus spake: ‘I grant that pact Proposed by Meave is worthier her than thee. If meeter terms thou knowest conceal them not.’ To whom Cuchullain: ‘Fergus, terms there be Other and meeter. I divulge them not: Divine them he that seeks them!’ On the morn Fergus declared his tidings to the chiefs In synod met. A recreant churl arose, And thus gave counsel: ‘Lure Cuchullain here On pretext fair; and slay him at the feast.’ Against that recreant Fergus hurled his spear, And slew him, and continued, ‘Hundreds six, Our best, have perished, and our march is slow: Now, warriors, hear my counsel, and my terms: Cuchullain scorns your gifts—of such no more! 'Twixt southern Erin and my Uladh's realm, Runs Neeth: across that river lies a ford; Speak to Cuchullain: “By that ford stand thou, Guarding thy land. Against thee, day by day, Be ours to send one champion—one alone:— While lasts that strife forbear the host beside!”’ Then roared the kings a long and loud applause, Since wise appeared that counsel: faith they pledged And sureties in the hearing of the Gods: Likewise Cuchullain, when his friend returned, Made answer: ‘Well you guessed! a month or more My strength will hold: meantime our Uladh arms.’ To seal that pact he sought the hostile camp, And shared the banquet. Wondering, all men gazed; And maidens, lifted on the warriors' shields, Gladdened, so bright that youthful face. At morn Meave, when the chief departed, kissed his cheek: ‘Pity,’ she said, ‘that such a one should die!’ The one sole time that Meave compassion felt. That eve Cuchullain drank the wave of Neeth, And wading reached Murthemné's soil, his charge, And knelt, and kissed it. As the sun declined He clomb a rocky height, and northward gazed, And cried, ‘Ye Red Branch warriors, haste! I keep The ford; but who shall guard it when I die?’ Next morning by that stream the fight began, Two champions face to face: and, every morn, Rang out, renewed, that combat; every eve Again went up from that confederate host The shout of rage. Daily their bravest died, Thirty in thirty days. Feerbraoth fell, And Natherandal, though the Druid horde Above his javelins, carved at set of moon From the ever-sacred holly stem, had breathed Vain consecration, and with futile salve Anointed them: confuted soon they sailed In ignominy adown that seaward tide With him that hurled them. Eterconnel next, Dalot, and Kyre;—yet he who laid them low Was beardless at the lip. While thus they strove A second month went by. Such things beholding The queen was moved; and in her grew one day Craving for Cruachan. But on her ear Rolled forth that hour the lowings of that Bull Cualgné's Donn: for he from Daré's house Had heard, though far, the clamours of the host, And answered rage with rage. Then Meave resolved, ‘Though all my host should perish to a man This foot shall tread no more my native plains Save with that Bull in charge!’ To her by night Came Cailitin, who ever walked by night Shunning mankind, and Fergus most of all, Cailitin, father of the Magic Clan, And thus addressed her: ‘Place in me thy trust: I hate Cuchullain, for he scorns my spells Resting his hope on Virtue. In thy camp Ferdïa bides, a Firbolg feared of all. Win him to meet Cuchullain. They in youth Were friends: to slay that friend will lay a hand Icy as death upon Cuchullain's heart. Ferd?a dies—thus much mine art foreshews— Then I, since magic spells have puissance most Not on the body sick but spirit depressed, Fall on him with my seven and twenty sons, Magicians all. One are we: thence with one May fight, thy pledge unflawed. A drop of blood Shed by our swords, though small as beetle's eye, Costs him his life.’ Fiercely the queen replied, ‘A Firbolg! Never!’ Cailitin resumed, ‘Then send for Lok Mac Favesh!’ With the morn Mac Favesh sought her tent. Direful his mien; Massive his stride; his body brawny and huge; For, though of Gaelic race, the stock of Ir, With him was mingled giant blood of old, Wild blood of Nemedh's brood that hurled sea rocks 'Gainst the Fomorian. Oft the advancing tide Drowned both, in battle knit. Before the queen Boastful the sea-king laid his club, and spake: ‘Queen, though to combat with a beardless boy Affronts my name, my lineage, and my strength, His petulance shall vex thine eye no more! Uladh is thine to-morrow!’ At the dawn By hundreds girt, the great ones of his clan, Down drave he to the ford, and onward strode Trampling the last year's branches strewn hard by That snapped beneath him. Hides of oxen seven Sustained the brazen bosses of his shield; And forth he stretched a hand that might have grasped A tiger's throat and choked him. O'er his helm Hovered an imaged demon raven-black. Cuchullain met him; hours endured the strife, That mountained strength triumphant now, anon Cuchullain's might divine. Then first that might Was fully tasked. Upon the bank that day Stood up a Portent seen by none save him, A Shape not human. Terribly it fixed On him alone its never-wandering eye; The dread Mor Reega, she that from the skies O'er-rules the battle-fields, and sways at will This way or that the sable tides of death. He gazed; and, though incapable of fear, Awe, such as heroes feel, possessed his heart: Wild beatings shook his brain; his corporal mould Throbbed as a branch against some river swift; And backward turned his hair like berried trails Of thorn that streak the hedge. Three several times He saw her, yet fought on. With beckoning hand At last that Portent summoned from the main A huge sea-snake: round him it twined its knots: Then on Cuchullain fell the rage from heaven: A sword-blow, and that vast sea-worm lay dead! A sword uplifted, and Mac Favesh fell Prone on the shuddering flood. In death he cried, ‘Lay me with forehead turned to Uladh's realm;— They shall not say that fugitive I died.’ Cuchullain wrought his will: then, bleeding fast, Stood upright, leaning on his spear aslant; A warrior battle-wearied. From the bank Meantime, the dark magician, Cailitin, He and his sons, with wide and greedy eyes, That still, like one man's eyes, together moved, Had watched that fight, counting each drop that fell Down from Cuchullain's wounds. When faint he stood At once their cry rang out like one man's cry; Like one their seven and twenty javelins flew: As swift, Cuchullain caught them on his shield: An instant more, and all that horde accursed Was dealing with him. From the trampled ford Went up a mist of spray that veiled that strife, Though pierced by demon cries, and flash beside Of demon swords. O'er it at last up-towered On-borne, such power to blend have Spirits impure, A single Form—as when o'er seas storm-laid The watery column reels, and draws from heaven The cloud, and drowns the ship—a single Form, And Head, and Hand, clutching Cuchullain's crest: Even then he sank not. O'er that mist of spray Glittered his sword. There fell a silence strange: That spell which made the many one, dissolved; Slowly that mist dispersed; and on the sands That false Enchanter lay with all his sons Black, bleeding bulks of death. Amid them stood Cuchullain; near him, seen by him alone, That dread Mor Reega, now benign. She spake: ‘I hated thee, because thy trust was less In me than Virtue's aid. I hate no more. Be strong! a trial waits thee worse than this— No man is friend of mine till trial-proved.’ Yet sad at heart that eve Cuchullain clomb His wonted rock, and faint with loss of blood, And mused: ‘My strength must lessen day by day;’ And northward gazed, thus murmuring; ‘All too late To save the land those Red Branch Knights will come When I am dead— My war-car, and my war-steeds are far off, And I am here alone.’ That night through grief He slept not; for the Magic Clan had power, Though dead, to lean above him as a cloud Darkening his spirit, and to grief and shame Changing bright days gone by. While thus he sat He saw, not distant, on the forest floor, In moonbeams clad, though moon was near him none, A pure and princely presence. Lithe his form In youthful prime: chain armour round him clung Bright as if woven of diamonds. Glad his eye; Dulcet his voice as strain from Elfin glen Far heard o'er waters. Thus that warrior spake: ‘My child, an ancestor of thine am I, Great Ethland's son, in sacred battle slain, Fencing my people from an alien foe. Among the Sidils The Fairy Hills. now, and fairy haunts Moon-lit, and under depths of lucent lakes, Gladness I have who in my day had woe, And youth perpetual though I died in age. Thou need'st repose: for sixty days thine eyes Have closed reluctant. Sleep a three days' sleep Whilst I thy semblance bearing meet thy foes.’ Thus spake the youth, then sang Lethean song Wedded with softer song from waters near, And, straight, Cuchullain slept. Three days gone by, Again that vision came. ‘Arise,’ he said: The warrior rose; and lo! his wounds were healed: Down sped he to the river. Waiting there Stood up Iarion, champion of the queen, There stood, nor thence returned. Eochar next Perished, then Tubar, Chylair, Alp, and Ord, In all full ninety warriors. Ninety days Had fled successive since that strife began, When, on the ninetieth eve, at set of sun, His strength entire, and victory eagle-winged Fanning his ardent cheek, Cuchullain scaled Once more that specular rock. Within his heart Spirit illusive, that with purpose veiled Oft tries the loftiest most, this presage sang: ‘Southward, not distant, thou shalt see them march At last, that Red Branch Order, in their van Thy Conal Carnach!’ Other spectacle Met him, a chariot small with horses small, And, o'er the axle bent, a small old man Urging them feebly on. It was his sire! T'wards him Cuchullain rushed: the old man wept, For gladness wept, and afterwards for woe, Kissing the wounds unnumbered of his son: Reverent, Cuchullain led him to his cell; Reverent, he placed before him wine and meat; Nor questioned yet. The old man satisfied, Garrulity returned, though less than once, Now quelled by patriot passion. Thus he spake:— ‘Setanta! son of mine! I bring ill news: Uladh is mad; the Red Branch House is mad: Mad as thy mother; all the world are mad, And I that was a mad man twenty years Am now of Uladh's sons most nigh to sane. Attend my tidings! Through the realm I sped: A mist hung o'er it heavy, and on her sons Imbecile spirit, and a heartless mind, And base soul-sickness. Evermore I cried, “Arise! the stranger's foot is on your soil: They come to stall their horses in your halls; To slay your sons; enslave your spotless maids: Alone my son withstands them!” Shrewd of eye Men answered, “Merchant; see thy wares be sound! No lack-wits we!” Old seers I saw that decked Time-honoured foreheads with a jester's crown: I saw an ollamb trample under foot His sacred Oghams; next I saw him grave His own blear image on the tide-washed sands, Boasting, “The unnumbered ages here shall stoop Honouring true Wisdom's image.” Shepherds set The wolf to guard their fold. The wittol bade The losel lead his wife to feast and dance: Young warriors looked on maids with woman's eyes. I drave to Daré's Dûn: his loud-voiced sons Adored the Donn Cualgné as their sire, And called their sire a calf. To Iliach's tower I sped: he answered, “What! the foe! they come! Climb we yon apple trees, and garner store! Wayfarers need much victual!” Onward next To Sencha's castle: on the roof he knelt, Self-styled the kingdom's chief astrologer, Waiting the unrisen stars. To Olchar's Dûn I journeyed: wrapped in rags the strong man lay Thin from long fast; with eyelids well-nigh closed: Not less beneath them lay a gleaming streak: “Awake me not,” he said: “a dormouse I! Till peace returns I simulate to sleep.” I sought the brothers Nemeth: one his eyes Bent on the smoke-wreath from his chimney's top, One on the foam-streak wavering down the stream; While each a finger raised, and said, “Tread light! All earth is grass o'er glass!” I sought the mart: Men babbled: “Bid the Druids find the king!” I sought the Druids' College: in a hall Rush-strewn to smother sound, they held debate On Firbolg and Dedannan contracts pledged Ere landed first the Gael. The Red Branch House Was changed to hospital; and knights full-armed Nodded o'er lepers' beds. I sought the king: From hall deserted on to hall I roamed: I found him in his armoury walled around With mail of warriors dead. There stood, or lay, The chiefs by Uladh worshipped. Nearest, crouched Great Conal Carnach patting of his sword Like nurse that lulls an infant. On his throne Sat Conchobar in miniver and gold: His eyes were on his grandsire's shield that breathed At times a sigh athwart the steel-lit gloom: Around his lips an idiot's smile was curled: “What will be will be,” spake the king at last: “All things go well.”’ Thus Saltain told his tale: One thing he told not—how, a moment's space, The passion of an old man's scorn had wrought Deliverance strange for that astonished throng, High miracle of nature. He, the man Despised since youth, the laughter of the crowd, Himself restored to youth by change like death, Had rolled his voice abroad, a mighty voice; They heard it: from their trance they burst: they stood Radiant once more with mind! They stood till died The noble anger's latest echo. Then The mist storm-riven put forth once more its hand And downward dragged its prey. Upon his feet When ceased his father's voice, Cuchullain sprang: That rage divine which gave him strength divine Had fallen on him from heaven. He raised his hands And roared against the synod of the Gods That suffer shames below. Beyond the stream That host confederate heard and armed in haste, And slept that night in armour. Far away Compassion touched the strong hearts of the Gods, The strongest most—Mor Reega's. Ere that cry Had left its last vibration on the air High up the Battle-Goddess, adamant-mailed, Was drifting over Uladh. Eman's towers Flashed back her helmet's beam. With lifted spear She smote the brazen centre of her shield Three times; and thunder, triple-bolted, rolled Three times from sea to sea. The spell was snapped: Humanity returned to man! The first Who woke was Leagh, Cuchullain's charioteer: Forth from the opprobrious mist he passed like ship That cleaves the limit of some low marsh-fog And sweeps into main ocean. Forth he rushed, Forth to Cuchullain's chariot-house, and dragged Abroad that war-car feared of all—men say The axle burnt beneath his hand—and yoked White Liath Macha, and his comrade black, And dashed adown the vacant, echoing streets, And passed the gateway towers: the warders slept: Beyond them, propped against the city wall, A cripple crunched his mouldering crust. Still on He rushed, the reins forth shaking and the scourge, Clamouring and crying, ‘Haste, Cuchullain's steeds! On Liath Macha! Sable Sangland on! Your master needs you! Ay! ye know it now! The blood-red nostril smells the fight far off! On to Murthemné, and Cualgné's hills, And Neeth's remembered ford!’ Unseen he drave; So slowly, clinging still to brake and rock And oft re-settling, vanished from the land The insane mist. That hurricane of wheels Not less was heard by men who nothing saw: On stony plain, in hamlet and in vale:— They muttered, as in sleep, ‘Deliverance comes.’ BOOK III. THE COMBAT AT THE FORD. ARGUMENT. Meave sends her herald to Ferd?a the Firbolg, requiring him to engage with Cuchullain in single combat. Ferd?a refuses to fight against his friend; yet, later, he attends a royal banquet given in his honour; and there, being drawn aside through the witcheries of the Princess Finobar, he consents to the fight. The charioteer of Ferd?a sees Cuchullain advancing in his warcar to the Ford, and, rapt by a prophetic spirit, sings his triumph. For two days the ancient friends contend against each other with remorse: but on the third day the battle-rage bursts fully forth: and on the fourth, Cuchullain, himself pierced through with wounds, slays Ferd?a by the Gae-Bulg. He lays his friend upon the bank, and, standing beside him, sings his dirge. Meantime the queen, ere dawned that ninetieth morn, Mused, ill at ease: ‘Daily my people die, And many a stormy brow on me is bent:— What if they turn on me like starving hounds That rend their huntsman?’ In her ear once more Sounded the word of Cailitin: ‘The man To fight Cuchullain is the man he loves: His death were death to both.’ Then came the kings Confederate, saying, ‘Send Ferd?a forth! Ferd?a is the mightiest of our host: Ferd?a is Cuchullain's chief of friends: Westward of Alba in the Isle of Skye Scatha, that rock-browed northern warrioress, In amplest lore of battles trained them both: Except the Gae-Bulg, every feat of arms Is known to each alike.’ The queen gave way: She sent her herald to the man she scorned With offers huge, tract vaster than his own, Not barren like his mountains billow-beat, But laughing in the lap of Ai's plains; A war-car deftly carved and ribbed with brass; And, for his clansmen, raiment of all dyes, Twelve suits. A stalwart man yet fair as strong The Firbolg towered, dark-eyed, dark-haired, palefaced, Unlike the Gael. Melodious was his voice But deeper than a lion's. Ceaseless thought On immemorial wrongs—he brooded still O'er glories of Moytura and Tailltenn, Their great assemblies and their solemn games, And kingly graves—had stamped upon his brow Perpetual shade; and ever, on the march If high on crags there stood some Gaelic tomb Wind-worn a thousand years, he passed it by With face averse, muttering, ‘New men! New men! We note not such!’ The herald's task discharged, He answered thus, not turning: ‘Tell your queen That I, a Firbolg, serve, but not for hire, A cause not mine. Cuchullain is my friend: Better I died than he!’ O'er-awed though wroth The queen despatched in statelier embassage Three warriors, and three ollambs, and three bards: With reverence they addressed him. ‘Chief and Prince! True prince, though scion of a house deject, The queen, who judges all men by their deeds, This day hath in thine honour made a feast And sues to it thy presence. Kings alone Partake that banquet; Ailill first, and she Of princesses the fairest, Finobar!’ Scornful the Firbolg answered, ‘Finobar! She whose bright face hath frosted with death's white Full four score faces of war-breathing men Sent to that Ford successive! Let it be! Tell them I join their feast: tell them beside Their bribe shall prove base gold!’ In mantle blue Clasped by a silver torque, and silver belt Enringed with silver rings innumerable, That evening from his tent Ferd?a strode With large attendance. Ailill and the queen Received him on their threshold. At the board Princes alone had place. High up, o'er each Glittered upon the wall his blazoned shield. King Ailill placed Ferd?a on his right; Beyond him sat the Princess. In her ear Her mother whispered as she neared that seat: She answered with her eyes. Well-stricken harp Gladdened that festive throng; and Ailill told, The rage of hunger lessening by degrees, Full many a tale of the heroic past, When, youthful yet, he ranged 'mid friends and foes Such men as breathed no longer. Servitors Brimmed oft the goblets: and Ferd?a's brow, As song to song succeeded, tale to tale, Remitted its first sternness. Finobar Unconsciously had dropp'd her jewelled hand Not far from his: her large and dusky eyes, Shyly at first from his withdrawn, at last Full frankly met them: on her lips the smile Increased, though waveringly, then waned, not died, And in it sadness mingled as she spake: ‘But late yon harper told us of a dream— My earliest of remembered dreams was sad; I saw some princess of your earlier stock Whose lover late had perished, slain in fight By ours, methought then recent. At her feet— Why there I scarcely know—I made lament: “All thou hast lost for thy sake I renounce: For me, like thee, no bridal rites forever! Dead on thy marriage garland lies mine own; For lo! the stain accursed is on our sword: Thy race came first: this Island should be theirs!”’ Ferd?a listened; and the icy pride Thawed in his bosom. With a sudden change The jubilant music into martial soared, Wild battle-chaunt. Upon the warrior's hand Still nigh to hers, there lay a scar. With eye Reverently dewed the princess gazed thereon: ‘Yes, of your war-deeds I have heard so long, It seems as though since childhood—Whence that wound? What battle left it there? What sister bound it? I would that sister were my sister too, Partaker of my heart, my hope, my life: I have no youthful friend!’ She paused: again But now with paler cheek, and hurried, spake: ‘Beware my mother! She would send you forth Her knight to meet Cuchullain! Shun that man! Cuchullain spares not: four score warriors dead Avouch it. Chief of Gaels he is! Ah me! The last great battle 'twixt the old race and new Would find the same sad ending as the first.’ The Firbolg frowned: she faltered, ‘Am I false, False to my race’—and tears were in her voice— ‘False to my race, who cannot wish such ending?’ She paused; again she questioned of his wars: He told her of his sire's. Like one who thinks Not speaks, she murmured low, ‘A soothsayer Thus warned my mother—I was then a child— “Bring not that maid to war-fields! She shall die Grieving for some dead warrior.”’ Speaking thus, Though false the princess lied not. Changed once more The martial songs to amorous and of mirth, And once again the torches' golden flame Laughed on the cup new-brimmed. Again she spake That lovesome one, ‘I love not songs of love! Better the war-song! Best, methinks, of all That lullaby half war and sorrow half Breathed by some bride while o'er her wounded lord Softly descends the sleep:—so softly sank Cold dews of evening on this flower still wet.’ She took it from her breast, and held it near: He smelt it; kissed it; kept it. With a smile She added, ‘For your sister? Have you one? If so, 'tis likely she resembles me: They chide me oft: “No Gaelic face is thine, Dark-eyed, dark-browed, a rebel since its birth!”’ She ceased; again she spake: ‘Even now, methinks, That lullaby I spake of I can hear! Is it for thee, my friend, or Cuchullain?’ That hand, of flower amerced, drew nearer yet To his. That smile had passed. Tearful she turned On him those luminaries of love and death, Her eyes, like stars in midnight waters glassed; Turned them, but spake no longer. Through his brain Shivered their shrouded lustre; through his blood: The sanguine currents from the warrior's heart Long sad, to female sympathies unused, Drank up at once that splendour, and the tears That splendour's strange eclipse. And yet, that hour, Seen in some lonelier region of his soul Another presence, O how different, stood! Again, that hour, he saw those guileless eyes, Blue as the seas they gazed on; saw once more That hair like winter sunshine, brow snow-white, That unvoluptuous form and virginal, That love-unwakened breast with love for all, Those hands that knew not what their touch conferred, Those blithesome, wave-washed, scarce divided feet:— The huge cliff smiled upon her; seemed to say, ‘Ah little nursling mine! Ah tender child Of winds and rocks untender!’ Had he loved? Sadness is celibate and eremite: His converse long had been with injuries past, In Scatha's isle with frowning crags and clouds— Ay, but with one beside, a friend, his nearest, Who loved the daughter of that warrioress And won Ferd?a's help in love. Ferd?a Had never spoken love; nor thought, ‘I love:’ And yet, that hour, was false. A hundred harps Rang out together, and the feast was o'er: Murmured the rose-red lips; but what they said He heard not. Mournfully at last withdrew That hand so near to his—he had not touched it— Those eyes, like eyes fated thenceforth to bear One image on till death. She joined her mother. The queen, as he departed, took his hand: Alone they stood: she spake: ‘That noble scorn Which spurned a bribe, approves a Firbolg's worth: 'Twas Ailill sent that herald: 'twas not I. I know you now, and proffer royal terms Confirmed by guarantee of all our kings: Accept this combat; and the princess wed! Ferd?a! I have made that offer thrice To three dead warriors with the king's consent, Never, till now, with hers!’ He pledged his word: The battle day was fixed; the morrow morn: She took that glittering torque whose splendours clasped Her mantle red; with it his mantle bound: Then with attendance to his tent he passed. Meantime, that night within his forest lair In dreams Cuchullain lay, and saw in dreams, Not recent fights, but ocean and that isle Where with Ferd?a he had dwelt in youth, With Scatha—and another—loved, yet left. He mused: ‘The dearest of my friends survives: These wars will pass; Ferd?a then and I Thenceforth are one for aye!’ That self-same hour The Firbolg slowly woke from troubled sleep Murmuring as one in trance, ‘Against my friend! Against my only friend!’ His clansmen watched With gloomy brows his arming. One sole man They feared—that man Cuchullain. Morn the while Was dawning, though she raised nor glowing cheek Nor ardent eyes, with silver wand not gold Striking the unkindling portals of the East; And, ere the sun had ris'n, Ferd?a bathed Three times his forehead in the frosty stream; And bade his charioteer attend; and drave Begirt by stateliest equipage of war Down to the river's brim. In regal pomp The host confederate followed, keen to watch With Meave, and Ailill, and with Finobar, All passions of a fight unmatched till then On war-fields of the immemorial world; While clustered here and there, on rock or mound, Minstrel and food-purveyor, groom and leech With healing herbs, and charms. The sun arose And smote the forest roof dew-saturate As onward dashed through woodlands to the Ford Cuchullain's war-car. Nearer soon it rolled Crushing the rocks. Above those wondrous steeds That Great One glittered through low mist of morn, Splendour gloom-veiled. Ferd?a's charioteer Half heard, half saw him. Spirit-rapt, yet awed, Perforce thus sang he standing near the marge: ‘I hear the on-rushing of the Car! I see There throned that warrior not of mortal mould Swathed in the morning. Dreadful are his wheels; Dreadful as breaker arched, when on its crest Stands Fear, and Fate upon the rock-strewn shore: But not sea-rocks they crush, those brazen wheels, But realms, and peoples, and the necks of men. ‘I see the War-Car! Terrible it comes, Four-peaked; and o'er those peaks a shadowy pall Pavilioning dim crypt and caves of death: I see it by the gleam of spears high held, The glare of circling Spirits. Lo! the same I saw far northward drifting, months gone by, Ere yet that madness quelled the northern land.’ Then cried Ferd?a, stationed where huge trees Shut out unwelcome vision: ‘For a bribe Thou seest these portents, singing of my death!’ Once more, in agony prophetic, he— ‘The man within that car is Uladh's Hound! What hound? No stag-hound of the storm-swept hills: No watch-hound watching by a merchant's store: The hound he is that tracks the steps of doom; The hound of realms o'er-run, and hosts that fly; The hound that laps the blood!’ Again he sang: ‘The Hound of Uladh is a hound with wings; A hound man-headed! Yea, and o'er that head Victory and empire, like two eagles paired, Sail onward, tempest-pinioned. Endless morn Before him fleeting over seas and lands, With shaft retorted lights his chariot-beam. That chariot stays not, turns not: on it comes Like torrent shooting from a tall cliff's brow, Level long time; then downward borne!’ ‘A bribe!’ Once more Ferd?a cried; ‘A bribe! a lie! Traitor! for Ailill's gold and gold of Meave, Thou sing'st thy master's death-song!’ By the stream Cuchullain stood: nor yet he knew his foe: That foe who slowly to the Ford advanced Full panoplied, and in his hand a spear. Long gazed they each on each. Cuchullain spake: ‘Welcome howe'er thou com'st, Ferd?a! Once In Scatha's Isle far otherwise thou camest Morn after morn with tidings fresh of war, Plaything and pastime of our brother brands. This day thou com'st invader of my land Murthemné, bulwark broad of Uladh's realm; Thou com'st to burn my cities, spoil my flocks— A change there is, Ferd?a!’ Stern of brow The Firbolg answered: ‘Friends we were; not peers: The younger thou. 'Twas thine to yoke my steeds; Arm me for fight. A stripling hopes this day With brandished spear to make a mountain flee! Son of the Gael! long centuries since, thy race Trampled my race: their vengeance hour is near: I bid thee to depart!’ To him his friend: ‘Ferd?a, in the old days on Scatha's Isle Thou wert my tribe, my house, my stock, my race! Questioned I then on battle-plain, or when On frosty nights we crouched beneath one rug, Ancestral claims, traditions of the clan?— A change there is, Ferd?a!’ Thus with words Or mild, or stern, in hope to save not slay, Those friends contended. Sternest was the man Whose conscience most aggrieved him. ‘To this Ford Thou cam'st the first, old comrade! choice of arms Is therefore thine by right!’ Cuchullain spake: Ferd?a chose the javelin. Arrow-swift, While still the charioteers brought back the shaft, The missiles flew. Keen-eyed as ocean-bird That, high in sunshine poised, glimpses his prey Beneath the wave, and downward swooping slays him, Each watched the other's movements, if an arm Lifted too high, or buckler dropped too low Left bare a rivet. Long that fight endured: Three times exhausted sank their hands: three times They sat on rocks for respite, each the other Eying askance, not silent: ‘Lo the man Who shields an ox-like or a swine-like race That strikes no blow itself!’ or thus: ‘Ah pledge Of amity eterne in old time sworn! Ferd?a, vow thy vow henceforth to maids! The man-race nothing heeds thee!’ Evening fell And stayed perforce that combat. Slowly drew The warriors near; and as they noted, each, The other bleeding, friendship unextinct In all its strength returned: round either's neck The other wound his arms and kissed him thrice: That night their coursers in the self-same field Grazed, side by side: that night their charioteers With rushes gathered from the self-same stream Made smooth their masters' beds, then sat themselves By the same fire. Cuchullain sent the half Of every healing herb that lulled his wounds To staunch Ferd?a's; while to him in turn Ferd?a sent whate'er of meats or drinks Held strengthening power or cordial, to allay Distempered nerve or nimble spirit infuse, In equal portions shared. The second morn They met at sunrise:—‘Thine the choice of arms;’ The Firbolg spake; the Gael made answer, ‘Spears!’ Then leaped the champions on their battle-cars And launched them into battle. Dire their shock In fiery orbits wheeling now; anon Wheel locked in wheel. Profounder wounds by far That day than on the first the warriors gored, Since closer was the fight. With laughing lip Not less that eve Cuchullain sang the stave That chides in war ‘Fomorian obstinacy’: Again at eve drew near they, slower now For pain, and interwove fraternal arms: Again their coursers in the self-same field Grazed side by side, and from the self-same stream Again their charioteers the rushes culled: Again they shared alike both meats and drinks, Again those herbs allaying o'er their wounds With incantations laid. Forlorn and sad Peered the third morning o'er the vaporous woods, The wan grey river with its floating weed, And bubble unirradiate. From the marge Cuchullain sadly marked the advancing foe:— ‘Alas, my brother! beamless is thine eye; The radiance lives no longer on thy hair; And slow thy step.’ The doomed one answered calm, ‘Cuchullain, slow of foot, but strong of hand Fate drags his victim to the spot decreed: The choice to-day is mine: I choose the sword.’ So spake the Firbolg; and they closed in fight: And straightway from his heart to arm and hand Rushed up the strength of all that buried race By him so loved! Once more it swelled his breast: Re-clothed in majesty each massive limb, And flashed in darksome light of hair and eye Resplendent as of old. Surpassing deeds They wrought, while circled meteor-like their swords, Or fell like heaven's own bolt on shield or helm. Long hours they strove till morning's purer gleam Vanished in noon. Sharper that day their speech; For, in the intenser present, years gone by Hung but like pallid, thin, horizon clouds O'er memory's loneliest limit. Evening sank Upon the dripping groves and shuddering flood With rainy wailings. Not as heretofore Their parting. Haughtily their mail they tossed Each to his followers. In the self-same field That night their coursers grazed not; neither sat Their charioteers beside the self-same fire: Nor sent they, each to other, healing herbs. Ere morn the Firbolg drank the strength of dreams Picturing his race's wrong; and trumpet blasts Went o'er him blown from fields of ancient wars: And thus he mused, half-wakened: ‘Not for Meave; Not for the popular suffrage; not for her That maid who fain had held me from the snare, Fight I that fight whose end shall crown this day: O race beloved, this day your vengeance dawns Red in the East! The mightiest of the Gaels Goes down before me! What if both should die: So best! Thus too the Firbolg is avenged!’ So mused he. Stately from his couch he rose, And armed himself, sedate. Upon his breast He laid, in iron sheathed, a huge, flat stone, For thus he said, ‘Though many a feat of arms Is mine, from Scatha learned, or else self-taught, The Gae-Bulg is Cuchullain's!’ On his head He fixed his helm, and on his arm his shield Sable as night, with fifty bosses bound, All brass; the midmost like a noontide sun. Cuchullain eyed him as he neared the Ford, And spake to Leagh: ‘This day, if thou shouldst mark This hand or slack or sluggish, hurl, as wont, Sharp storm of arrowy railing from thy lips That so the battle-anger from on high May flame on me.’ The choice of arms was his: He chose ‘the Ford-Feat.’ On the Firbolg's brow A shadow fell:—‘All weapons there,’ he mused, ‘Have place alike: if on him falls the rage He will not spare the Gae-Bulg!’ Well they knew, Both warriors, that the fortunes of that day Must end the conflict; that for one, or both, The sun that hour ascending shone his last: Therefore all strength of onset till that hour By either loosed or hoarded, craft of fight Reined in one moment but to spring the next Forward in might more terrible, compared With that last battle was a trivial thing; Whilst every weapon, javelin, spear, or sword, Lawful alike that day, scattered abroad Huge flakes of dinted mail; from every wound Bounded the life-blood of a heart athirst For victory or for death. The vernal day Panted with summer ardours, while aloft Noon-tide, a fire-tressed Fury, waved her torch Kindling the lit grove and its youngling green From the azure-blazing zenith. Waxed the heat:— So waxed the warriors' frenzy. Hours went by: That day they sought not rest on rock or mound, Held no discourse. Slowly the sun declined; And as wayfarers tired, when twilight falls, Advance with strength renewed, so they, refreshed, Surpassed their deeds at morning. With a bound Cuchullain, from the bank high springing, lit Full on the broad boss of Ferd?a's shield, His dagger-point down turned. With spasm of arm Instant the Firbolg from its sable rim Cast him astonished. Upward from the Ford Again Cuchullain reached that shield: again With spasm of knee Ferd?a flung him far, While Leagh in scorn reviled him: ‘As the flood Shoots on the tempest's blast its puny foam; The oak-tree casts its dead leaf on the wave; The mill-wheel showers its spray; the shameless woman Hurls on the mere that babe which was her shame, So hurls Ferd?a forth that fairy-child Whom men misdeemed for warrior!’ Then from heaven Came down upon Cuchullain like the night The madness-wrath. The Foes confronted met: Shivered their spears from point to haft: their swords Flashed lightnings round them. Fate-compelled, their feet Drew near, then reached, that stream which backward fled Leaving its channel dry. While raged that fight Cuchullain's stature rose, huge bulk, immense, Ascending still: as high Ferd?a towered Like Fomor old or Nemed from the sea, Those shields, their covering late from foot to helm, Shrinking, so seemed it, till above them beamed Shoulders and heads. So close that fight, their crests That waved defiance mingled in 'mid air; While all along the circles of their shields And all adown their swords, ran, mad with rage, Viewless for speed the demons of dark moors And war-sprites of the valleys, Bocanachs And Banacahs, whose scream, so keen its edge, Might shear the centuried forest as the scythe Shears meadow grass. To these in dread response Thundered far off from sea-caves billow-beat And halls rock-vaulted 'neath the eternal hills, That race Tuatha, giant once, long since To pigmy changed, that forge from molten ores For aye their clanging weapons, shield or spear, On stony anvils, waiting the day decreed Of vengeance on the Gael. That tumult scared The horses of the host of Meave, that brake From war-car or the tethering rope, and spread Ruin around. Camp-followers first, then chiefs Innumerable were dragged along, or lay 'Neath broken axle, dead. The end was nigh: Cuchullain's shield splintered upon his arm Served him no more; and through his fenceless side Ferd?a drave the sword. Then first the Gael Hurled forth this taunt: ‘The Firbolg, bribed by Meave, Has sold his ancient friend!’ Ferd?a next, ‘No Firbolg he, that man in Scatha's Isle, Who won a maid, then left her!’ Backward stepped Cuchullain paces three: he reached the bank; He uttered low, ‘The Gae-Bulg!’ Instant Leagh Within his hand had lodged it. Bending low, Low as that stream—the war-game's crowning feat— He launched it on Ferd?a's breast. The shield, The iron plate beneath, the stone within it, Like shallow ice-film 'neath a courser's hoof Burst. All was o'er. To earth the warrior sank: Dying, he spake: ‘Not thine this deed, O friend: 'Twas Meave who winged that bolt into my heart!’ Then ran Cuchullain to that great one dead And raised him in his arms and laid him down Beside the Ford, but on its northern bank, Not in that realm by Ailill swayed and Meave: Long time he looked the dead man in the face; Then by him fell in swoon. ‘Cuchullain, rise! The men of Erin be upon thee! Rise!’ Thus Leagh. He answered, waking, ‘Let them come! To me what profit if I live or die? The man I loved is dead!’ But by the dead Cuchullain stood; and thus he made lament: ‘Ferd?a! On their head the curse descend Who sent thee to thy death! We meet no more; Never while sun, and moon, and earth endure. ‘Ferd?a! Far away in Scatha's Isle A great troth bound us and a vow life-long Never to raise war-weapons, each on each:— 'Twas Finobar that snared thee! She shall die. ‘Ferd?a! dearer to my heart wert thou Than all beside if all were joined in one: Dear was thy clouded face and darksome eye; Thy deep, sad voice; thy words so wise and few; Dear was thy silence: dear thy slow, grave ways, Not boastful like the Gael's.’ Silent he stood While Leagh in reverence from the dead man's breast Loosened his mail. There shone the torque of Meave: There where the queen had fixed it yet it lay. Cuchullain clutched it. ‘Ha! that torque I spurned! Dark gem ill-lifted from the seas of Death! Swart planet bickering from the heavens of Fate! With what a baleful beam thou look'st on me! 'Twas thou, 'twas thou, not I, that slew'st this man’— He dashed it on the rock, and with his heel Crushed it to fragments. Then, as one from trance Waking, once more he spake: ‘O me—O me, That I should see that face so great and pale! To-day face-whitening death is on that face; And in my hand my sword;—'tis crimson yet. That day when he and I triumphed in fight By Formait's lake o'er Scatha's pirate foes The woman fetched a beaker forth of wine, And made us drink it both; and made us vow Friendship eterne. O friend, my hand this day Tendered a bloody beaker to thy lip.’ Again he sang: ‘Queen Meave to Uladh's bound Came down; and dark the deed that grew thereof; Came down with all the hosting of her kings; And dark the deed that grew thereof. We two Abode with Scatha in her northern isle, Her pupils twinned. The sea-girt warrioress That honoured few men honoured us alike: We ate together of the self-same dish: We couched together 'neath the self-same shield: Now living man I stand, and he lies dead!’ He raised again his head: once more he sang: ‘Each battle was a game, a jest, a sport Till came, fore-doomed, Ferd?a to the Ford, I loved the warrior though I pierced his heart. Each battle was a game, a jest, a sport Till stood, self-doomed, Ferd?a by the Ford— Huge lion of the forestry of war; Fair, central pillar of the House of Fame; But yesterday he towered above the world: This day he lies along the earth, a shade.’ BOOK IV. THE INVASION OF ULADH. ARGUMENT. Cuchullain lies long in the forest nigh to death from his wounds, and yet more through grief for Ferd?a. Meave crosses the Ford into Uladh, and captures the Donn Cualgné. His fate. The confederate kings fall out among themselves; Meave summons a war council: whereupon there bursts forth a contention between them and the Exile-Band. She makes the circuit of all Uladh, yet enacts nothing memorable. Lastly she marches against Eman, but slowly, being encumbered by her spoil. Uladh rouses itself out of its trance of Imbecility. The death of Ketherne. Finobar is fain to draw Rochad to the cause of her mother, but fails. Her fate. Meave, falling into despondency, re-crosses the frontier. Silence amid the wide, confederate camp: No clang of sword or shield; no warrior's tread Striding to Meave with battle-gage down flung For him who kept the Ford. But when six days Were past, and none had seen that threatening helm, There went abroad a rumour, ‘He is dead:’ Then sped to her six champions claiming fight: Whom from her presence spurning, Meave advanced With all her host o'er Uladh's frontier line By Daré's castle and the ill-omened gate Whereon high-seated Daré's Fool had hurled Against her, scorn and gibe. As Meave drew near Forth rolled the bellowing of Cualgné's Donn, Cause of that war. King Daré's sons had fled; But in the gate-way stood their old, grey sire, Alone, and slew the first that passed its bar: The rest dashed in upon him, and he died. That night within her deep heart mused the queen: ‘'Tis done! I tread at last great Uladh's realm; But, day by day, Faythleen's Imbecile Mist That slew its manhood, drifts. What if those kings Confederate fail me, or some ruinous chance Leaves half my army on the war-field dead? Connacht would frown against me: Ailill, too, Would blink yet more his jesting eyes, and boast Fionbannah, and extol his worth o'er mine! He shall not! Let us send, ere Fortune change, My boast, my spoil, Cualgné's matchless Donn, To Cruachan! That done, befall what may, My worship there stands whole!’ Next day, ere dawn, Southward she sent the Donn. Suspecting fraud, He on his keepers turning slew a score, Yet peaceful paced at last betwixt their ranks, At each side fifty spears. Five days past by, Forth rolled the roar of Ailill's Bull snow-white, Fionbannah. Bursting through his guard, the Donn Rushed t'ward the sound. Upon the midway plain The rivals met. All day that battle raged While wood to wood thunder on thunder hurled, And all the bulls of Erin sent reply. Shepherds, through wood-skirts peering, saw the end, The Donn at sunset rushing t'ward the north, And, heaped upon his back—their horns entwined— Fionbannah dead! All night the conqueror rushed O'er hill and plain and prone morass. When dawn Looked coldly forth through mist along the meads Far off he kenned a rock: that rock he deemed A second Bull: collecting all his might Thereon he hurled his giant bulk, and died. Yet no man dared to breathe this news to Meave; Not Ailill's self. Exulting, she marched on. Six days, and in Cuchullain's cell no change— The bud grew large; the earlier violet died; He neither spake nor moved. His wounds were deep; Deeper his grief; for that cause ampler power They gained, that clan accursed of Cailitin, With ghostly spells darkening the warrior's heart: As lie the dead, he lay. One eve, what time The setting sun levelled through holly brakes Unnumbered dagger-points of jewelled light And 'neath the oak-stem burned a golden spot, Leagh, standing near his couch, reproached him thus: ‘In time of old the greatness of thy spirit Had ever strength to salve thy corporal griefs: But now through coward heart thou makest no fight, Dying as old men die!’ Cuchullain heard; But answered nought. Next day, while near them buzzed At noon the gilded insect swarm with sound That stung the fever in his nerves, he spake: ‘While lived Ferd?a wounds to thee were jest; Thy grief it is that drags thee to the pit; Grief; and for what? Of treasons worse is none Than sorrow when thy country's foe is dead! Not man is he, the man who dies of grief.’ He spake: Cuchullain fixed a vacant eye On that sad, wrathful face. Then hastened Leagh To where those giant coursers, side by side, Stood tethered 'mid green grass and meadow-sweet Within a lawn; and led them to a stream, And bade them drink; and later led them home; And placed their corn before them, and they ate: Next spake he, ‘Horses ye; and yet ye know To eat at need, while men self-sentenced starve!’ Thus of that man whom most he loved on earth He made complaint. Liath, the lake's white son, Tossed high his head in anger. By his side Sangland, his dusky comrade, sadly ate, Moistening with tears her barley. Late that eve Cuchullain beckoned Leagh: ‘To Conor speed: Speak thus: “Put on thine arms and save thy land Since now the Hound that kept thy gate is dead:— Make no delay!”’ At midnight Leagh went forth Though loth to leave his master to the care Of cowherd rude, or swineherd. Tenderer aid Ere long consoled him. Beauteous as the dawn Next morn two shepherd boys seeking a lamb Came on the sick man in his forest nook; Long time they gazed on him compassionately: With voice benign and tendance angel-like Onward into his confidence they crept; His lips with milk, the purest, they refreshed; They placed the dewy wood-flowers in his hand; They sang him ballads old, not battle-songs, Too loud such songs they deemed, but Fairy lore, Or tale of lovers fleeing tyrant's rage: Among the last unwittingly they sang ‘Cuchullain's Wooing;’ how the youth had found Eimer, the loveliest lady of the land Within her bowery pleasaunce, girt with maids Harping, or broidering fair in scarf deep-dyed Blossom or bird: how long he sued; and how She answered, ‘Woo my sister: woo not me!’ How, glorying in her loveliness, her sire Had sworn no chief should ever call her wife Who won her not by valour; how that youth Had scaled his rock and slain his guards and forth Through all the blazing ruins of that keep, Led her by hand, a downward-looking bride, Majestic, unconsenting, undismayed, But likewise unreluctant. As they sang Above that suffering face there passed a smile; And where that smile had lain there crept a tear; And in few minutes more asleep he sank Who had not slept nine days. Swiftly meanwhile The host of Meave marched onward: bootless speed; Since ever one day's progress by the next Was cancelled; tortuous mind made tortuous course Now bent awry to capture spoil, anon To avenge some private wrong. Fergus the while Inly with fury raged; for still his thought Was ‘Eman—Vengeance.’ Meave, to calm his wrath, Albeit she scorned debate, a council called And made demand, ‘To Eman speed we, Kings, With central wound striking at Uladh's heart, Or wind, as now, at random through the realm, With havoc huge, and plunder?’ Rose a chief Aulnan, the son of Magach, one whose pride Was not in war-deeds but in crafty brain, And spake, keen-voiced, keen-eyed. ‘To Eman! Queen! Not difficult the emprise; but whose the gain? Suppose it burnt, what then? We have but sown The sanguine seed of endless wars to come. The Uladh chiefs live scattered. Eman's fall Touches not them. Their strength ere long revived Southward in search of vengeance they will rush. Slay them yet weakling! Slay them ere they wake! Slay them in mountain hold and forest lair In vale and glen: slay each apart, half-armed; Easy the task!’ Arose the Exiled King: ‘“Easy the task!”’ he cried; ‘that Daré learned! Unarmed—alone—I saw the old man fall! “Easy the task!”’ Then brake upon him Alp That ruled in far Iorras, clamouring thus: ‘Fergus, we love our queen; but love not thee! Hostile to ours thy race. Thou seek'st, we know it, King Conor's fall, not Uladh's. Hear me, Queen! The siege of Eman means a three months' siege: Be wary lest, ere yet that time is past King Conor with his exiles makes a pact, And they who now but rate thee drink thy blood: Be wary likewise lest in half that time Thy host melt from thee like a wreath of snow! The Gael is restless; lives on chance and change; The clan grows home-sick: victory in its grasp, It pines for babe unkissed, or field unreaped: My counsel then is Aulnan's. Like a flood Wind devious through the land and strip it bare: Till then let Eman be.’ Debate ere long, For chiefs there were who loved the nobler war, Passed on to raging storm. Old friendships died; And from the dust of ages injuries old Leaped up like warriors armed. In Fergus wrath Gave way to scorn: with haughty port he spake, A man majestical yet mirthful too. ‘Great Lords and Kings—since Kings ye claim to be— King-vassals, world renowned for mutual hate, Alone of men I censure not your strifes, Knowing their cause. The very air you breathe, The founts whereof you drink, the soil you tread, Are all impregnate with a sacred rage; And false alike to usage, country, blood, Were he among you who, for three hours' space, Discerned 'twixt friend and foeman. Lords and Kings, Attend a legend from your annals old, A laughing picture of man's life this day. In Erin's earlier age there reigned two kings: Each had a swineherd who, through magic power, Could clothe himself with shape of aught that lives In heaven, or earth, or sea. Friendship forever They pledged; then strove ten years, with hosts allied So huge that none remained to till the land. At last the vanquished swineherd changed to crane: A crane, the victor chased him. Twenty years High up they fought; to each side Erin's birds Flocking in clans, the factions of the heavens. Those twenty years run out, the vanquished crane Dropped on a stream and straight to salmon changed; Instant his foe, to salmon turned at will, From stream to sea pursued him. Far and wide All scaly shapes that buffet Erin's waves From sprat and minnow up to shark and whale Beat up in finny squadrons. Forty years With deepening rage they fought, till round the isle Main ocean boiled, and from her ships black-ribbed Melted the tar, and fire-mist girt the deep. Next changed those salmons twain to dragon-flies: But while they sat in hate on neighbouring pools A dun cow and a red cow drank them up Unwittingly. Two bull-calves these brought forth, That, grown, with battle thunders dinned the realm For eighty years! How say ye, Lords? From these Sprang not the Bulls that shake this day our land, Fionbannah, and the Donn? For these we fight, And in their honour hold, on festal days, As now our roaring synods!’ Fiercely and long The unwise council strove; and Meave, who feared Far more the petulance of her lesser kings Than that great exile's loftier wrath, resumed Next morn her march erratic. On she passed, The Dal Araidhé forests on her right, Northward to Moira's plain and Clannaboy, And through the Glynns of Ardes eastward glimpsed Alba's blue hills. Dalríad fastnesses She burned with fire, and seized full many a herd On banks of Bann; then westward turned, and kenned The grass-green sparkle of remote Lough Foyle, And where the winding river-sea divides Fanad from Inishowen's cliffs forlorn. Aileach she passed, more late the seat of kings; And, southward next, that lake whose lonely isle Descends, through caves, to Spirit-worlds unknown, Northern Lough Derg by penitents revered. Thus Meave in circle marched round Uladh's realm, And heard the murmur of its three great seas, Yet nothing wrought of perdurable fame. Conor, meantime, round Eman ranged his hosts There flocking night and day. ‘I bide my time,’ He said, ‘till Uladh's wound is wholly healed;— Fergus I deem the sage of battle-fields, Though fool in all beside.’ But sloth and fear In manly hearts at worst rare visitants, Leave them betimes, like vermin caught by chance That quit ere long the clean. O'er Uladh's breadth Daily some chief, or fragment of a clan Long chilled by rumour of Cuchullain slain, Despite King Conor's hest assailed the queen Marching, though late, on Eman. First of these Was Ketherne. Hewing oaks on Fuad's crest He marked her host, and rushed, a naked man From waist to head, his axe within his hand, In fury on it. Late that eve his kernes Forth from the battle tore him bleeding fast From fifty wounds. That night physicians five Stood bending o'er his bed: the eldest spake; ‘Ketherne, thou son of Fintan, thou must die!’ Then Ketherne raised himself and with one blow Smote him upon his forehead that he died. In turn the second,—‘Ketherne, thou must die:’ And Ketherne slew him. Feebler-toned the third Whispered, ‘The man must die;’ and died himself; Likewise the fourth. Old Ithal was the fifth, A son of Alba. He with stealthy foot Stepping o'er corpses of his brethren slain, Made keen-eyed inquest of the wounds; then spake: ‘Of these the least is dangerous: fatal none: Two cures for such there be, diverse in kind; Ketherne, thou son of Fintan, make thy choice! The first is slow but certain: where thou liest Full three months thou must lie; then rise restored: The second is immediate: strength divine It pours like light into a warrior's veins; Then dies its virtue, and the warrior dies!’ Ketherne laughed loud: ‘My choice is quickly made: Three months bed-ridden, or one vengeance day Joyous and glorious! Leech! I rather choose With mine own hand to avenge eretime my death Than trust that task to others!’ At his word Ithal prepared a wonder-working bath Strewn with strange herbs, and bathed therein the man, Then bade him drink of some elixir bright Drawn from the sun. As one refreshed by sleep He rose: he clomb his war-car; sought the foe: He slew threescore, their best. At last the strength Ceased from his arm; once more the wounds late closed Opened; and back the warrior sank, and died. Such hindrances, and every day had such, Likewise huge herds and cumber of her spoil Slackened the march of Meave. Full many a chief Perished in bootless fight; full many an eye Turned on her, malcontent. But trial worse Had found her through her daughter, Finobar. Without an hour's misgiving or remorse, In beauty's pride not less than patriot zeal— Wilier she was than Meave, and haughtier far— Champion on champion she had sent to doom Beside that fatal Ford. Ferdía most Had tasked the sorceress, for in him alone Vanity kept no place. She watched the fight No pallor on her fruit-like cheek, no cloud Dimming her eyes. Without a sigh she kenned From far the Firbolg, last of all his race, Dead on the soil once theirs. Even then she knew not The inevitable shaft had pierced whate'er Of woman heart was hers. The strong man's death Lifted that veil his victory ne'er had raised: Standing 'mid others she beheld him dead: Thenceforth that deep-toned voice, that mournful front, Those stern yet stately ways, so great and plain, Haunted her memory. Oft with sudden spasm She strove to shake that viper from her breast Which sucked its life-blood. ‘I, the Princess, love! And love a Firbolg!’ She had never loved: Self-love, sole regent of the unloving heart, Till then had barred it 'gainst all tenderer loves: In vain the island chiefs had wooed and sued: She spurned them each and all. Of these the last Was Rochad, and the proudest, in the North A vassal prince of Conor's, oft his foe: The passion she had kindled she had scorned: Rochad had vowed revenge. In wonder Meave Noted the weary lids, the vanishing bloom, The abrupt accost, though haught yet unassured; The movements to mechanic changed, the mind Still strong, yet widowed of its flexile strength: These things she saw; their cause she ne'er divined: Love for the living Meave could understand: For her the dead was dead. To Finobar The one thing yet remaining was her pride: Questioned, her answer ever was the same, ‘Onward, to Eman!’ Nearer it each day They drew. One evening through the sunset mist A camp, high seated on a bosky hill, Stood out, fire-fringed: it stood aloof as one That halts 'twixt war and peace. Ere long they learned Rochad had chos'n that site, with Uladh's King Friendly but half, thence slow to prop his cause. Then spake the queen; ‘The hand of yonder chief Sustains our battle's balance. If his host, Now dubious, joins the bands that vex our flank No choice remains but this, a homeward course Or, if a march to Eman, then the loss Of half our hard-earned spoil and hate henceforth Of all our vassal kings.’ Finobar's eyes Flashed as of old—that was their latest flash— She answered thus: ‘Leave thou the rest to me! He loved me, Rochad, once: ere sets yon moon I bring you tamed the lion of yon hills, Ay, in a silken leash!’ Rochad far off Beheld her coming; marked it with a smile; Welcomed her gaily; led her to the feast; Thence to his tent wherein was none beside. There put she forth whatever subtlest art In seeming-simple innocence disguised Imagines of persuasive, whatsoe'er Delicatest craft of female witcheries Potent for man's destruction can concert, To bend that warrior's will. The winter beam Thaws not the polar ice: o'er Rochad's soul So passed the syren's pleadings. Pleased not less To stand implored, he dallied with her suit Destined, and this he knew, to end in shame. She, self-deceived, inly made vow: ‘This tent I leave not, save victorious.’ Hours went by: She noted not their flight. Once more with skill Plastic as wind in woods, a measured strength Varying as minstrel's hand that grazes now, Now sweeps the tenderer or the deeper strings, To all the passions of the heart of man Glory, Ambition, Love, Revenge, she tuned The poisonous challenge of that passionate strain; While half the richness theirs aforetime throbbed Again in those sad accents, half their light— For oft from out the present shines a past Long dead—returned to eyes that, seen of none, Had wept away their splendours. Calm he sat, Sternly quiescent. On her it stared at last, The fatal truth. She saw her power was gone; And all that posthumous life late hers sank back In embers lost and ashes. On the West Rested her gaze. A cloud of raven black, Its veil for half that night, had drifted by; Her mother's camp shone out, a pallid gleam; O'er it the moon descended. Finobar That hour recalled her boast, ‘Ere sets yon moon I bring you tamed the lion of yon hills, Ay in a silken leash!’ The Orient soon Whitened with early dawn. Forlorn it lay On hill and heath and plain and distant mere, Forlorner on the haggard face—for oft A face, still fair, in anguish antedates Its future—of that woman as she knelt, She knelt at last, low on that threshold low. Then came the hour of Rochad's great revenge: Then first he answered plainly: ‘Finobar! One day I knew you not: I know you now: Your spells are null when once their trick is learned: Likewise your face has lost its earlier charm. Back to your mother! Tell her, ere sets yon sun I join the king my master; from his gate Repel with scorn the invader.’ Forth he passed Without farewell. A clarion broke ere long Her trance: adown the slope she saw his host Winding t'ward Eman. From a burning couch She rose next eve; and, strong with fever's strength, Paced swiftly by that sunset-crimsoned stream Which girt the camp of Meave. Anon she marked In all who met her, change inexplicable, Strange eyes, strange faces, strange embarrassed ways: Sadly compassionate that change in some: In others questioning glance and meaning smile Hinted at things that through her flaming heart Passed like a sword of ice. Whisperings not less There were, but these she heard not: ‘What! all night! From eve to morn with Rochad in his tent!— The men she fed on hopes—on hopes alone— Died at the Ford! Well! pride must have its fall! Rochad is joined with Conor!’ Slanders worse Some chiefs whom most her haughtiness had galled Ventured, vain-glorious:—‘They were not surprised Too well they knew her.’ Late one eve the truth Sprang like a tigress on her. In his tent She heard her father with her mother speak: ‘She yet may wear the crown: her maiden fame Is lost for ever!’ Three hours ere her death That sentenced one spake to her mother thus: ‘Noise it among the host that grief for those Her countrymen—the Gael—who, near the Ford— Ere yet that Firbolg shared the common fate, Fell by Cuchullain, snapped her thread of life: Bear on your march my body:—raise the cairn On the first hill that sees Emania's towers.’ So spake she; and the queen obeyed her hest: She flung that rumour forth; and all who heard, Heart-stricken now, believed it. But on Meave A piercing sadness fell; and by her bed Orloff her buried son stood up and spake: ‘Home to thy native realm, and Cruachan! Not less a battle waits thee great and dread 'Twixt Gairig and Ilgairig.’ One day's march The queen marched eastward; then upon a hill, The first whose summit looked on Eman's towers, Interred the all-beauteous one with Pagan dirge, And o'er her piled the cairn. Southward, next morn She turned, and crossed the Ford. Fulfilled was thus Cuchullain's word breathed o'er Ferd?a dead; ‘Finobar snared thee: Finobar shall die.’ But many a century later Uladh's sons Rose up and said, ‘Great scorn it is and wrong, Yon stranger's grave should gaze on Eman's towers;’ Then bore they forth those relics once so fair With funeral rites revered and Pagan dirge, And laid them by the loud-resounding sea, And o'er them raised a cairn: and, age on age, As sighed the sea-wind past it shepherds said, ‘It whispers soft that sad word, Finobar!’ BOOK V. QUEEN MEAVE'S RETREAT. ARGUMENT. Queen Meave, having reached the sacred plain of Uta, sacrilegiously encamps thereon. A Druid denounces the late war as unrighteous, while Fergus contemns it as ineffectual; and immediately afterwards the War Goddess, Mor Reega, manifests herself to the host. Next evening, while division of the spoil is being made, Meave discerns the advance of King Conor; and Ailill transfers the supreme command to Fergus. The battle is gloriously won by him. That night Meave is warned by signs and omens; and Cuchullain, weak from his wounds, arrives suddenly and beyond hope, in the Ulidian camp. From midnight to near sunset the next day he lies in a trance, during which Fair Spirits minister to him; and there is shown to him a vision of some mystic greatness reserved for Erin, yet of an order which he cannot understand. Just as the second battle is all but lost Cuchullain wakes; and Meave is driven in utter overthrow across the Shannon. At last the war had whirled its giddy round; And Meave, well nigh returned, the Shenan The Shannon. near Beside Ath-Luain Now Athlone. Athlone. streaming in its might, Decreed to make division of her spoil Ere yet she crossed it. In the West the sun Was sinking; in the East the moon uprose; While camped her host on Uta's sacred plain Betwixt the double glories. Far away Glittered immeasurable the pastures green Illumed with million flowers. Nor spade, nor plough Till then that virgin precinct had profaned, Nor sound, save Shenan's murmur, stirred therein. There stood the Tomb Heroic. Beams and showers Alone might pierce that soil sabbatical; Such reverence held the spot. Now all was changed; Ill choice; if chance, ill-omened. Neighing steeds Dinned the still air; while here at times was heard Whistling of him that fixed his tent, and there Wood-cleaving axe or feaster's laugh mistimed. Higher and higher rose the moon full-orbed, Mirrored in pool and stream. At intervals Half lost in bard-song near or shout remote, The slender wailing of some captive maid Rang out and died. The royal tent was set High on a grassy platform. Meave that night The first time since the death of Finobar Was cheerful of aspéct; and, banquet o'er, Rising, her warriors thus addressed with vaunt Beseeming not a queen. ‘A year,’ she said, ‘Is passed since northward to the war we marched:’ Then forth she loosed the sheets and spread the sails And bounded on the waves of proud discourse Recounting all her triumphs; first, her wrong; Lastly, the cause of war, Cualgné's Donn Chief captive 'mid her captives! Here her voice Rang loudest, and her eyes their fiercest beamed. Rapturous response succeeded; one alone, A Druid old, dissentient. Thus he spake Not rising, to that throng of courtiers crowned: ‘Ill doctrine have ye praised this evening, kings, Unwise, to Erin's sons a pit and snare, Extolling war not based on righteous cause Nor righteous ends ensuing. Kings and Queen, The end of war is retribution just For deeds unjust; ill cure for greater ill: Wars there must be; and woman-mouthed were he Who railed against them:—ay, but demon-mouthed The man that boasts of war-dishonouring wars Opprobrious, spiteful, predatory, base. Sirs, how began this feud? It rose from jest! And what its close? A sacred site profaned, Inviolate till this day!’ The warriors frowned; Yet all men feared the Druid beard and rod: They stood in silence. Fergus rose and spake: ‘Sirs, I have heard a war this day extolled, A war this day denounced. Men say that I Was born on battle-field: on battle-fields Certes I lived my life. What thing war is I ought to know. Yet, sirs, these wearied eyes Rolled many a day around from East to West Still seeking war, and found it not; they saw Six hundred men successive by the hand Of one man slain, Cuchullain; saw the torch Hurl the red smoke-cloud o'er a thousand homes: They saw a war-dance circle Uladh's coasts; They saw the ravished flock, and ravished herd, The captive throng lance-goaded on its way, Swine-herd and shepherd, hoary head, and maid Beaming and basking in the healthful glow Of youthful beauty. Sirs, they saw more late, But saw from distance, Eman's walls high-towered: This, this they saw not; warriors, warrior-ruled, Marching against them! Mountebanks of war They saw; not warriors!’ Plainly Fergus spake; Not otherwise than plainly could he speak, A man to truth predestined; from his birth By courage sealed to Truth. The legend saith That down before him on his natal morn All Erin's fays and sprites from river or rill Laid tributes due: but, mightier far than they, A wingèd goddess ran from sea to sea, The island's breadth, to hail him! As she sped, The path before her, prone till then and low, Rising ran out, a craggy ridge sublime, The same that for a hundred miles this day Divides the realm! That highway lofty and straight Foreshowed that ne'er in tortuous paths or base That babe should shape his way. Fierce from their seats The kings and chieftains sprang. A hundred swords Leaped from their sheaths, and from a hundred mouths One sentence, ‘Treason—death!’ By twos and threes A score of stragglers from the exiles' band Closed up behind him. Cormac Conlinglas Beside him stood, sword drawn. Again he spake; ‘Queen, till that day of shame was battle none, Nor on that day; nor since! But on that day Beside your daughter's cairn—more royal far Though fortunate less was she than you—we spake: I said, “You think without one blow to pass Eman that cast me forth;—without one blow To cross your Shenan, reach your Cruachan, There make your terms secure, the spoil retained, The exiles sent to judgment! Note you, Queen, Those horsement three, a mile on yonder road? My heralds they! The hour your flight begins They speed to Eman.” ‘You retreated. They Rode on to Conor. To that chief of foes I wrote: “Advance! The queen retreats: make speed! She shall not 'scape your battle. Know besides That battle of earth's battles till this hour Shall prove the bloodiest. In it, sword to sword We two shall meet: one die.” ‘To Conor thus I wrote that hour—Conor, the usurping king. Three times I might have hurled him from his throne, But spared, not seeking rule.’ In measureless scorn Then turned he to the kings, with threatening smile; ‘What mean those clamours and those swords half drawn Which draw ye dare not? Petty, titular kings! The shadow of that royalty once mine Dwarfs you to pigmies by comparison! I heard a cry of “Treason!” Let them lift Their hands who raised it! Kinglings mutinous, Princes seditious, ye the traiters are, And on the nod of him whom ye traduce, Your pageant crowns sit trembling! Ere three days Uladh is on you! I shall stand that hour Your King Elect; not Ailill's choice, but yours; The Battle-King; for well ye know that I, None else, have skill to range the battle-field, And roll the thunders forth of genuine war. Till that hour, silence, kings!’ Silence they kept, Long silence. Then far off, as though from depths By thought untraversable of cloudless skies, Such sound was heard as reaches ships at sea When, launched on airy voyage though still remote, Nation of ocean-crossing birds begins To obscure the serene heaven. That sound drew near: From every tent the revellers rushed. Then lo! That portent seen alone in fateful times, The dread Mor Reega! Terrible as Fate The Goddess of the battles high o'er head Sailed on full-panoplied, in hue as when On Alpine snows, their sunset glories gone, Night's winding-sheet descends. Upon her casque And spear beyond it pointing glared the moon, And on a face like hers that froze of old The gazers into stone. As slow she sailed On that huge army coldness fell of death: Yea, some there died. Next morning, from that spot Northward to Eman lay a branded track: Straight as a lance still stretched it, league on league; A bar of winter black through harvest fields, A bridge of ice spanning the rippling waves; A pledge those gazers dreamed not. In those days Foreboding soon, like sorrow, passed away: Ailill next morning counselled: ‘Ere the night Cross we the Shenan. If the Red Branch comes Fight we on Ai's plain!’ But Meave replied: ‘Not so; I fly not! One day here we rest: Our kings await their spoil.’ From morn to eve That spoil's partition lasted; first, huge herds: Flocks snowy-white through water-weeds and grass Followed, hound-driven. War-horses few were there, But many from the plough: with these, in crowds Poor hinds, and swine-herds, maidens skilled in works That knew to spin the flax or mix the dye Or card the wool. Next followed wild-eyed boys Bound each to each. No tear they shed, but scowled Defiance on their lords and sang fierce songs Of Uladh and her vengeance. King and chief Scanned each his prize with careless-seeming eye; Yet oft their followers strove, while onward paced The royal arbiters with wands high held, Ruling the wrangling crew. The royal throne Meantime stood high upon a mound, a throng Of warriors round it. Many a mirthful chance Provoked their laughter: loudest laughed the queen: But when she spake she waited not reply. Without a bound to east and west and south The prospect spread. Her eye was on the north:— Nor distant stood two hills: she asked their names: Her great eyes darkened when the answer came Of Gairig and Ilgairig. These the names By Orloff named that night. Betwixt these twain Shone out, distincter as the sun declined, Long northern ranges. Fergus marked her eye That moved not from them, smiled and made demand: ‘What find'st thou in our mountain ridges, Queen, That merits gaze so fixed?’ Then she: ‘I note Girdling their slopes a mist feathery and soft, As though of snow-flakes wov'n: above it, peaks Shoot up like isles cloud-hid. Within that mist I see strange lights that flit like shooting stars, Cross and re-cross, quick-bickering.’ With a smile That deepened, Fergus questioned once again: ‘Make large thine eyes and tell me all thou seest!’ Then Meave: ‘Through all that mist is movement strange, The agitation of some wondrous life, And t'wards us on it rolleth.’ Fergus next: ‘Thine eyes see well! If others saw like thee Their tongues would clang less loudly. Hear'st thou nought?’ The queen made answer, ‘Many a sea I hear That breaks on many a shore.’ Then Fergus cried: ‘Thou seest my Uladh coming, and the way And fashion of the advent of her war! For know, great Queen, even now the Red Branch Knights Car-borne descend yon slopes! That mist thou saw'st What was it but the tempest of their march, The dust flung upwards and the sweat exhaled And visible breath of warrior and of horse That breathes the northwind and the sunny glare? What else the snow-flakes which thou saw'st but foam Dashed from the horses' bits? Thy bickering stars, What else but flaming cars and fiery helms This way and that way passing? What thy peaks Crowning that mist, but Uladh's hills remote That send her children to avenge her wrong? And what that thunder sound of many seas But anthems of their coming? Well for thee If o'er them sail not—yea she sought them late— That dread Mor Reega!’ Reddened as he spake Meave's cheek late pale; yet careless she replied: ‘I see her not, therefore believe her not, And breathe securely since that gleam far off Is human, not demoniac nor divine, For never feared I yet the arm of man: Cuchullain dead, I hold the rest at nought.’ Thus Meave: but all the kings and chiefs arose Clamouring to her and Ailill: ‘Lo, 'tis come! All Uladh, and a battle such as ne'er Shook the foundations of this kingly isle! Now therefore bid him rule thy host, the man That knows to rule!’ Meave silent stood long time 'Twixt passions twain. Ailill to Fergus turned And spake: ‘Be thou henceforth our Battle-King:’ Thus spake he; then, releasing from his belt The sword usurped of Fergus, added thus: ‘Receive once more thy sword! in mirth erewhile I made it mine: the virtue in that blade Hath kept me till this hour.’ Fergus replied: ‘I take mine own: but one month past, this sword Had cut the cancer forth from Uladh's breast, And made thy throne a praise on earth for aye! I take mine own, on thee a sword bestowing That best becomes thee. Waiting long this hour For thee I kept it.’ Proudly Ailill clasped Its glittering hilt: Fergus drew back the sheath; And lo, a wooden sword, for babes a toy! The concourse laughed; the loudest Meave: though wroth Ailill a little whiffling laugh essayed With sidelong face. Then Fergus planted deep His sword within the soil, and knelt before it, And sware: ‘O thou my Sovereignty, my Sword, In many a battle, yet in none unjust, So many a year my glory and my mate! Mine art thou, mine once more! In all this host Who shall henceforth reproach me?’ To his task The strong one sped, and change was over all: Again the voice of discipline was heard: None drank in booths; none rushed abroad; with sloth Fierceness had vanished. Followers of the camp Alone were left in charge of flocks and herds: The clansmen to their duties were restored, The clans in order ranged. He delved a trench Barring from Uta's plain the advancing foe, And flung wide bridges o'er it, that his host Permission given, and not till then, might strike Forth pouring torrent-like, at Uladh's heart: Pits dug he next bristling with stakes sod-hid. He gave command like one that, born to power, With courteous might scarce conscious puts it forth: He spake the word: all heard him: all obeyed, Magnanimous to feel when majesty Authentic stood before them. Duty done Engendered strenuous joy, and strength, and hope: Thus through the mass the spirit of one man Triumphed, and ruling, raised it: on each face His corporal semblance lived—light-hearted might, Deliberate resolve. The moonlight hours Shone brightly on their labours. Six had sped Ere Fergus sought the royal tent where sat Revellers right ill at ease. As in he passed, The concourse, Meave herself and Ailill, rose, And did him regal honours. Of his toils Nought spake he; but their hearts who saw him swelled, And many marvelled why they late were sad: Again the laugh; again the tale; the song— Then came a change. A gradual sound was heard, Yet what and whence they knew not. It increased; It swelled ere long, voluminous; grating next; Then dreadful like the splitting of a world Whose strong foundations crumble. Forth they passed; Through hurrying clouds the moon rushed madly on, Now dim, now fiercely glaring. From the north The forest beasts, wildered by terror, dashed Wild through the camp while panic fell on all. The sole man unastonished, Fergus spake: ‘Sirs, late ye learn our warfare! As the spring, When the first spray catches the amorous red, Sends forth her song-bird, herald and harbinger, So Uladh sends before her onward steps Her shrill-voiced vanguard: men of might are they, Hewers of war-ways for her battle cars That cleave the centuried forests. First ye heard Their axes only; last, the falling trees:— Kinglings, ye look like men ill-pleased! What then? Not all delight in music. Sirs, good-night! When breaks the dawn be stirring.’ In the camp Few slept that night. Vanished the moon in cloud: Then shone the watch-fires on the northern hills Like stars. Next morn the Uladh host down swarmed Betwixt those neighbouring hills and round their base Far spread as flood that, widening on its way, Changes the heights to islands. Countless wrongs And shame at all that long inglorious trance, Roused wrath to madness; from them far they flung Encumbering arms, and, bare from scalp to waist, Worked on with plunging battle-axe. Three hours That trench withstood them. Kelkar ruled their left, Their right great Conal Carnach, while the king Marshalled their centre. There the strongest bridge, Tower-guarded, longest held their host at bay; Longer had held it, save that from his place Fergus, the hour foreseen arrived, gave word, ‘Fling wide the gates!’ In rushed they; but to meet A foe unwasted yet. The Red Branch Knights Surpassed their old renown. In fresher strength The host confederate met them. Meave herself With downward mace three champions slew that day, Him last, that felon son of faithful sire, Buini, the Ruthless Red, who, breaking pledge, Betrayed the sons of Usnach for a bribe: His father's prophecy the Accursed fulfilled Slain by a woman's hand. Fergus, at last Forth launched upon his native element, Raced o'er the battle billows like a bark When tempests stretch its canvas. Chief on chief Went down before that sword that still, men sware, With sweep that widened like a rainbow's arch Ran from his hand and harvests reaped of death. O'er-spent, not scared, that Northern host gave way Sudden from east to west. They broke and fled. Alone unvanquished Conor Conchobar, Their king, maintained his place. He rallied thrice The fugitives; thrice hurled them on the foe; Thrice stabbed them flying. Last upon the bridge He stood and sole. There met him face to face The sole of foes his equal. Dreadful gaze Long fixed they, each on other; Fergus spake: ‘Is this indeed that king who filched that realm Not his, then shamed it by a bloodier fraud; Who brake his pledge; who murdered Usnach's sons; Who drave from Uladh, Uladh's rightful king;— And comes he at my hand to meet his doom? Just Gods, I thank you!’ With a haughtier mien, Yet kingly less, King Conchobar replied: ‘Thou know'st me; and 'tis well! That king am I Who, less than thou by lineage, but in mind Loftier, attained that crown thou could'st not keep; That king, who, breaking through a jesting pact As eagles through a mist, by doom deserved Requited rebels proved. That king am I Who, when with traitors thou hadst made true pact, Forth hurled thee naked to the wild wolf's lair: That was the worst I wished thee: worse by far If aught of kingly once was thine, thou found'st— Beneath a hostile roof the beggar's dole Gorged on a golden platter, and the hand Protectress, of a woman!’ Long that fight Watched by two hosts in speechless stupor held, Direful and long! Equal in might those twain, Equal in craft of war. The kinglier soul Conferred alone the victory. Fergus raised The unvanquishable sword so late restored: It fell in thunder: with it fell the king, Fell to his knees, a bleeding mass, and blind: Again that sword was raised: a moment more Had ended all: then leaped to Fergus' feet, His knees enclasping, Cormac Conlinglas, King Conor's son. He spake these words alone: ‘My father!—Spare him!’ Fergus ne'er had scorned A look like his that hour. He turned; he spake: ‘Take hence that reptile:—holy is this plain! A true king here was buried!’ Conor's kernes Lifted him to his war-car. Slowly it moved; For Death was in the wheels thereof; and Death Stood at its door. That night in Uladh's camp Was silence strange and dread. By dying men Sat men sore wounded. Scornful of their foe And burning for revenge, the North had spurned Science of war, their boast, and left, death-strewn, Full half their host. Between their tents and Meave's All that long night the buriers of the dead Groped their sad way with red, earth-grazing torch, Turning the white face up in search of friend, Brother, or son. But in the tent of Meave Triumph ruled all: a hundred spake at once Each man his deeds recounting. Far apart Sat Fergus; on his brow alone was shade: Righteous that vengeance; but his country's blood Gladdened not him. Of those that marked him, some Had reverence for his sadness: lesser souls That long had hated, loathed the man that hour. Sudden the din surceased. Far other sound Quelled it: from Uladh's sorrowing camp it swelled, A jubilant cry soaring from earth to heaven! Then flashed the eyes of Fergus, and he cried: ‘Cuchullain lives! That sound is Uladh's shout What time the host he enters!’ With a brow Gloomy as night the queen replied: ‘'Tis false! We know that in that forest, months gone by Cuchullain perished!’ Silent stood they long, Listening. At last rang out far different note As piteous as the first was full of joy, A funeral keen world-wide. Then cried the queen: ‘Cuchullain lived! Cuchullain lives no more! Wounded and weak he came to aid his own: Too great such effort for a wasted frame: That was Cuchullain's death-dirge!’ Fierce she stood: Glorying she spake, and with attendance passed Forth from the hall of banquet to her tent: But as she passed she heard at either side, She and her ladies with her, trembling heard, Swift as dead leaves by tempest borne o'er rocks, The rushing of a panic-stricken host Invisible, though now the dawn was grey, A host t'ward Shenan flying! High o'er head A dulcet strain, unutterably sad, When ceased that phantom rush of fugitive feet, Drifted far northward. Then the queen was 'ware These were her country's gods that left her host. The legend adds that in her tent that hour Faythleen, the witch, she saw, who sat and wove A mystic web and sang a mystic song, Seen but by her:—and, later, o'er her bed Men say that Orloff bent, her buried son, And spake: ‘This day the battle shall be fought Of Gairig and Ilgairig.’ He meanwhile, The lord of all the battles, where was he, Cuchullain? Many a weary day and week Within his loved Murthemné's woods he lay, Sore-wounded man nigh death. Those shepherd youths Tended him still, or sang beside his bed; And ofttimes o'er his face the tears of Leagh In passionate gust descended. But the might Unholy of the clan of Cailitin That nightly hung above him like a cloud Began to wither when that mist accursed Which bound with Imbecility the land Drifted from Uladh's borders. On the breast Pellucid, likewise, of Murthemné's streams Benignant spirits scattered flowers and herbs With healing virtue dowered. He, morn and eve In those clear currents laid, renewed his youth; And, pure as infant's, came again that flesh Where festered late his wounds. At last, revived, He passed, car-borne to Eman, north. The fields Devastated, and wail from foodless glens Filled him as on he sped with wrathful strength: Next, tidings came of Conor's southward march: Exultingly he followed. On that night Of overthrow he reached the royal camp: Far off they kenned his car, and raised that shout Heard never save for him. When near he drew Way-worn, and wearied, and around him gazed, And saw that sight, and thought, ‘Too late; too late!’ His cheek down sank upon the breast of Leagh, And all men deemed him dead. Then rose that wail To Meave auspicious sound. There are who deem Cuchullain's tent that night was near the Well Where, purer far, more late the royal maids Fedelm and Ethna met that saint who gave To God the isle of Fate. Then too that Well Blessing diffused, they say; for from its brink A runnel o'er the pebbles ran with sound So sweetly tuned that on the warrior sank Deep seal of peace divine. The war-shouts near To him thus harboured seemed but ocean's sighs Round islands ever calm. Next came, on winds Fresher than earth's, divinities more high, He thought, than those that late from elfin meres Amid Murthemné's woods had dewed his face: And loftier songs were sung; and balmier flowers In holier fountains bathed were softlier pressed On bosom and brow; while shone before his eyes Visions more fair than lordliest battle-field, Though what they meant he knew not nor divined— High-towerèd temples cruciform that rose Far-seen o'er city and wood; and from their gates, Vestal procession issuing white, that wound Through precincts low where only dwelt the poor, The halt, the lame, the blind; and song he heard With spiritual pathos changing sense to soul, ‘The end of all is peace.’ In silence slid The constellations down the western sky; And endless seemed the going of that night, And measureless that joy. At break of day Came Conal Carnach and the Red Branch Knights To see that sleeper's face. Thereon the dawn Laughed, with glad beam: and lo! where long had lain Pallor of death, now burned a healthful red: Not less they dared not touch him; since with him Geisa it was if any broke his rest. They left him, and the battle-storm rang out. Warned by defeat Uladh had raised ere morn, Fronting her camp, three bulwarks: at the first And distant most, three hours the conflict raged. It fell at last. When rose the conquerors' shout Leagh to Cuchullain crept, and touched him not, Yet knelt and whispered, ‘Heard you not that sound?’ And thus Cuchullain answered still in trance; ‘I heard the runnels in Murthemné's woods Snow-swoll'n in spring.’ Then Leagh stood up and mused, ‘The hue of health is on his face, and yet Because he will not wake the land is shamed.’ Next round the second bulwark raged the war Hour after hour: heroic deeds were done: Heroic deaths were died: at last it fell: Again and nearer rose the conquerors' shout: Again with bolder foot and forehead flushed Leagh to Cuchullain moved and touched him not, But, bending, murmured, ‘Heard you not that sound?’ And he, without awaking, answered thus: ‘I heard the birds in Eimer's pleasaunce sing Honouring our marriage morn.’ Then Leagh went forth Groaning, and smote his hands, and wept aloud: ‘Because he will not wake the host must die!’ Around the loftiest bulwark and the last Once more for hours the battle raged: it fell! And louder thrice that shout went up. The gaze Of Leagh was on him fixed: he heard it not: Slowly it died; and as it died the wail Came feebly forth from Uladh's host. A wail Since those old days of Cullain and his hound To him was thrilling more than battle shout: A change went o'er his face: a moment more And in his tent he stood, midway! Then lo! A marvel! for the wounded man that slept All day with bandages enswathed, up-towered Full-armed for fight a champion spear in hand, Work of some god! Swift from his tent he strode:— Without the hand of man there stood his car And those immortal steeds pawing the air Like shapes with pinions clad. A moment more And forward to Ilgairig's slope they dashed: ‘Let but the armies see him,’ inly mused Leagh, ‘and the work is done!’ Onward they sped; But not unnoted by that demon brood That hate the works of justice. From below Writhing in torment of their rage they heaved The grassy surface upward into waves Now swelling, now descending. Strong albeit The immortal steeds staggered. Cuchullain cried: ‘What! children of the tempest-wakened lakes Saw ye till now no billows? Yours they are! To others fatal, they but fawn on you! Exult ye in your native element, And waft your lord to vengeance!’ They obeyed: They reached Ilgairig's summit. On he sped Mantled with sunset. Terrible he shone! Both armies saw him—knew him! Onward yet; While from his golden arms and golden car Lightnings went forth incessant. In his van Victory and Fear their pinions spread. He reached Ilgairig's southern verge: he reined his steeds: High in his car he stood; with level hand Screening his eyes he scanned that battle-field His future course decreeing. On and on Adown that slope he flashed and o'er that plain Like zigzag sunshaft o'er the autumnal world; And ever where he came the host of Meave Gave way before him. On and ever on! And now the nearest of those bulwarks three He reached, and o'er its ruins swept, back driving The conquerors late, now conquered. On and on! And ever through that foe thick-packed he clave A lane of doom and death. Ere long they reached The second rampart. There it was he slew The great ones of Clan Libna, and the clans Guaré and Murdoc. Fiery faces thronged The air around him, and the voice of Gods Made smooth his way triumphant. On and on— Nor ceased he ever hurling left and right Destruction from his sling; nor slackened sleet Of javelins winged with fate. That brazen urn With death-stones heaped exhausted not its store, Replenished ever as by hand unseen Work of some God! That brazen cirque, not less Where stood his javelins ranged was never void; Work of some God! The on-rolling wheels devoured Those serried ranks; the war-steeds trod them down: Reached was that rampart furthest of the three; There in her war-car sat the queen; in front The Maineys Seven were ranged: his sword forth flashed: Four perished of the seven. Then faced the queen Westward, and fled amazed. He marked her flight: Eastward he turned. As on he carved his course Not now a lane alone of doom and death But ever widening valleys ruin-strewn Bore witness of his transit, for behind Closed ever up Cuchullain's household clans, Murthemné's, and Cualgné's. Perished there The Ossorians, and the Olnemacian chiefs, And many a champion famed from Slaney's bank To Lee and Laune, from Caiseal's crested rock Now Cashel. To Beara's strand. Who died not, fled and left Yet ampler 'twixt the bristling flanks of war That vacant space; and as the dolphin oft Raptured by gladness of clear summer seas While flames the noon on purple billows, swims All round and round some ship, Cuchullain thus Circled on foot at times that car wind-swift Mocking its slowness; then with airy bound Once more within it beamed. His boyhood's mirth Returned upon him. On the chariot's floor He marked those brazen balls, the sport that time Of men way-faring, snatched them up, tossed high, While yet careering round the blood-stained field, Then caught them as they fell, a glittering ring That girt that glittering head. Not less his eye Watchful pursued the flying foe; his hand Brought down to earth the fleetest. From the crests Of those twinned hills down rushed the total strength At last of Uladh. Universal flight Shook the vast field. The bravest men and best Caught by its current on were dragged like trees The sport of winter flood. Chieftain and king Sought, each, his home. Meave, with a remnant small Reached Shenan's bridgeless tide; and there had fallen Stretching to towered Ath-Luain helpless hands, Save that Cuchullain, 'mid the narrower way With outstretched arms and stature as of Gods Abashed that host pursuing: ‘Stand ye back! One day I shared her feast: she shall not die!’ He spake, and set by Shenan's wave his shield. Next morn the Ulidians where that shield had stood In silence stern planted three pillar-stones, White daughters of the tempest-beaten hills, In Ogham graved, ‘Vanquished by Uladh's sons Here fled the invader, Meave.’ Fergus alone The Exile-King, and they the Exile Band Fled not that day. Though few and bleeding fast Fearless upon a cloudy crag they stood, Phalanx prepared to die, prepared not less Dearly to sell their lives, while past them streamed That panic-stricken throng. The host pursuing Looked up, yet swerved not from their course. Once more Returning from the vengeance they looked up; Then passed in silence by. That eve, men say, While slowly paced Cuchullain t'ward the camp Bosomed 'twixt Gairig's and Ilgairig's hills, Lamenting strains of Goddesses were heard,— For whatsoe'er was female loved the man, If earthly female, with a human love, If heavenly, with a love compassionate— Lamenting strains that, ere his youth had passed That starry head must lie by Fate's decree Amid the dust of death. Cuchullain turned; Softly he answered: ‘Goddesses benign! Why weep ye? I was Uladh's Mastiff-Hound: The mastiff lives not long. What better lot For him than this;—the bandits chased, to die Beside his master's gate?’ So ends the Tain: Primeval battle-chaunt of Erin's race: Northward thus marched from Cruachan the Kings, Then back. The Foray of Queen Meave thus far. THE SONS OF USNACH. TO THE MEMORY OF EUGENE O'CURRY, FIRST PROFESSOR OF IRISH HISTORY IN THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, THIS POEM IS DEDICATED. CANTO I. THE BABE OF DESTINY. In Felim's house they kept the royal feast, And all the echoing hall with tumult rang, Tumult that still from morn to eve increased; And now the tale they told, and now they sang. Chief minstrel he to Conor, Uladh's Ulster. lord, Who graced that day, as oft, his favourite's board. Sudden to Felim's seat a woman rushed An ancient nurse with wrinkled face and worn Clamouring, her hands upheld and forehead flushed, ‘Felim, rejoice! for lo, thy babe is born! And proud be thou, for goodlier is this child Than e'er till now on proudest parent smiled!’ These tidings heard, yet higher swelled the acclaim; The Red Branch Knights oft pledged that infant's health, And prayed that all high gifts of wealth and fame, Great lordship, and great valour, and great wealth Might grace its life, and in the far-off days Crown its bright head with everlasting praise. But when an hour had passed, and somewhat more, The feasters heard far off a dulcet strain, And soon to them there entered damsels four; With measured step advanced they twain by twain, Bearing a cradle. On a low-raised throne They reared it, bowered in silk, and blossom-strewn. Therein a little maiden-wonder lay Unlike all babes beside in mien and hue, Bright as a lily-bud at break of day That flashes through the night's unlifted dew: Beaming her eyes, like planets glad and fair: And o'er her forehead curved a fringe of hair. The tender fairy hand, whose substance fine Glimmered as of compacted moonbeams made With such a stealthy smoothness did it shine Above the coverlet unquiet strayed; And some one said, ‘It knows the things to be, And seeks its wand of destined empery!’ From bannered stalls the Red Branch Knights drew nigh Circling that cradle. 'Neath the raftered roof A far-sunk window opened to the sky, While purple twilight wove with warp and woof O'er deepening heavens its dewy mantle dark, And dusking woods, that hour unseen; when, hark! Outside that casement rang a piercing wail; Then, past it slow, a dread and shrouded Form On demon wings was seen of all to sail: Shriek after shriek out-swelled into a storm: And o'er that flower new-born of infancy All heard the Banshee's death-denouncing cry. Then, from his seat in that high hall remote Whereon all day in silence he had sate Advanced, unguided, to that Infant's cot Cathbad, the Druid old, and man of Fate, And o'er that infant held his arms out-spread, And raised to heaven his grey and sightless head. At last he spake, ‘This day a woe to man, And yet the crown of woman's kind, is born: This day is sent a blessing and a ban; She shall be black as night, and white as morn; And lo, upon her cheek I see such red As stains great warriors on the war-field dead. ‘A death to mighty hosts that face shall be: Through her a king shall pass to banishment: Through her shall perish Usnach's peerless Three; Through her from sacred Eman's Eman, also called Emania, on the present site of Armagh. roofs fire-rent Even now I see the reddening smoke-cloud leap: Deirdré her name. Through her shall widows weep.’ King Conor heard, and in his angry mood Had risen to speak her doom, ‘That child shall die!’ Save that the Uladh nobles where they stood The king forestalling, hurled abroad their cry; ‘She must not live!’ Of all those knights but two Willed not that deed—the bravest Erin knew. For at that hour upon the cradle's right Stood Conal Carnach; at its left, though young, Swifter in chase, and stronger yet in fight, Cuchullain. Neither swelled that shout of wrong. Once more it rose: but Conor ne'er was known To walk in any counsel save his own. He spake: ‘She shall not die: this babe I take, My ward, until her destinies be known: An isle tower-girt is mine in yonder lake: There shall she live; and there shall live alone: That fatal beauty shall by none be seen: Full-grown the maid perchance may be my queen.’ Wondering they heard, but no man made reply For Conor's will was lord to all and each, A man of counsel deep and purpose high In action sudden, sparing of his speech: Early he won the people to his will: Ere long they feared him: but they loved him still. While yet a child, the stepson of that king Who reigned in Uladh, Fergus son of Roy, Conor had shared his home. That prince would bring Oft to his judgment court Queen Nessa's boy Whose forward wit unravelled every suit, Delighting in the wrangling clan's dispute. Fergus was loftier-minded: evermore He loathed the sordid plea, the varnished wrong, And inly scorned the Ollamb's learnèd lore: More dear to him the chase, the feast, the song: Wearied one day, he cried with laughing face, ‘Conor! speak thou the judgment in my place!’ The boy made answer none; but instant bowed, And judgment gave so full, so just, so clear, A shout rang upward from the astonished crowd, ‘Worthy of kingship thou!’ His crowned compeer, Fergus arose: incensed he made reply: ‘Throne him your king, if worthier he than I!’ Conor since then had ruled the Ulidian race, And ever waxed in subtlety and power, Though better loved was Fergus' honest face And princely port, forth issuing from his tower At times with horse and hound to chase the boar, Crowning at times the topmost ridge of war. Conor was loved and feared: one clan alone Nor feared, nor loved him, Usnach's: and the king In Usnach's house a rival to his throne Or noting, or belike imagining, Still watched that house to crush it had he dared; But Uladh loved it, and her monarch spared. CANTO II. THE BEAUTIFUL CHILDHOOD. Meantime to that green island in the lake The years came softly: softly went they by As like as snowy flake to snowy flake, As like as smile to smile, as sigh to sigh; And as some flower that feeds on beams and dew Its inmate rose in beauty ever new, Deirdré. With her abode an ancient dame, The tale-recounter of the royal court In years departed; Levarcam her name: None other to that island made resort Save now and then treading the downward rocks Some shepherd with the firstling of his flocks. Beauteous as heaven that gladsome captive was; With every month more fair, more gladsome grew; Her pastime, counting jewels in the grass, Emerald and amethyst, and sapphire blue, Or chasing—never part had she in sloth— From bloom to bloom the morning-gilded moth. Impassioned friendships hers with every kind: To her the Robin came; to her the Hare; And still with insight flashed from heart to mind, She guessed their lives in tree or bosky lair, Sharing their vernal joys, and, when the snows Besieged their haunts, condoling with their woes. Inquisitive the creature was, and brave: From rock to rock alone she roamed; untaught She knew to climb the tree and swim the wave; Soaring and swift, for knowledge still she sought, Nor sought in vain far wiser than she wist; Infantine minstrel and mythologist. For when she heard the wintry tempests raving, Fables she told of immemorial feuds, And warring Gods that still, for vengeance craving, Devastated some rival's peaceful woods; And when the morning shone, serene and mild, She laughed and said, ‘These Gods are reconciled!’ Often where cliffs darkened that lake's clear mirror Far down she gazed, and saw—not her own face, But phantom under-worlds of joy, not terror; Now wars; now bridals of some magic race; Now regal palace beauteous in decay; Now flowery slopes, and fairy babes at play. All she had seen in the upper world, and all Pictured by Levarcam in legend glowing, Met her more gem-like in that watery hall There flushed with glories of her own bestowing: And oft, aggrieved, from those fair scenes ideal The creature raised her eyes on objects real. Betwixt that island and the forest green A causeway stretched. Scorning King Conor's law, O'er it in summer maidens tripped unseen And told her tales of all they heard and saw, And flowers in May, and fruits in summer brought her Or with her danced beside the moonlit water. Two men alone she saw; at times the king: His grizzled beard and searching eye she fled, And wept to think that in some far-off spring She must be his. That thought with angry dread Touched her keen instinct. In that face august Something unblest she saw, and ill to trust. Yet oft he came, watching that flower of beauty That still from crude, reluctant bud emerged, And citing still past vow, and future duty Impledged thereby; and still with presents urged; And ever reaped for such more scoffs than gain— Officious is his zeal whose hope is vain! The other visitor she better loved, A Druid, silver-headed: to her isle Daily he came, a teacher well-approved; And much he taught her, with his grave calm smile Advancing still into his pupil's heart: To elicit thence, he knew, was to impart. He taught her all a monarch's bride had need In those old days to learn. Devout and grave, He taught her all the Ogham signs to read, Inscribed on mossy stone or mystic stave; And how to trace green Erin's Kings, each one To Heber or Heremon, Ir, or Donn. One morn as on their glories he descanted ‘Where are they now?’ his wondering listener said, Then silent stood like shape to stone enchanted: But when he answered sadly, ‘They are dead,’ She bounded t'ward the on-wavering butterfly, And cried, ‘At least he lives; and so do I!’ Once too she caught that Druid by the sleeve And spake: ‘Great Master, this I ask of thee! Who was it made the sun, the morn and eve, The stars, the flying clouds, yon boundless sea?’ Her great wide eyes, clasped hands, and lips compressed, Better than words enforced the unending quest. The Druid answered, dubious, still refining With stress and strain of profluent words that left The problem's jet-black surface smooth and shining But ne'er the mystery's heart of marble cleft, And ended; ‘God is God:—but ah, the woe! That which God is, not even the Druids know!’ ‘Then God must be a God who hides Himself In sport, or else for cause we know not of! And doubtless,’ thus ran on the careless elf, ‘Who hides in sport will show His face in love; Much seeking will not find Him. He will come Then when He wills; and take His children home. ‘For I remember once in yonder wood My nurse, to mock me, hid her in an oak, Whilst idly I a dragon-fly pursued: I missed her soon: I wept: then forth she broke! Thus likewise God, hearing His creatures moan, Will flash on them, and cry, “Mine own, mine own!” ‘That day the wise will serve Him; but the fool Will sport with Ogham stave, or dragon-fly That lights his spark—lo there—on dusky pool! Of those that sport at once, and serve am I! Therefore, come quickly, God! And thou, good stave, Fly hence!’ And forth she flung it on the wave! But when she found within the Master's face Not wrath—for that she looked—but awe-struck woe, A change there passed too swift for eye to trace Athwart her rain-dark eyes and front of snow; And straight the child, by love's remorse possessed, Kissed with her whole bright face that Druid's breast. The years passed by; and, onward as they sped That child from beauty still to beauty grew; In her full many a fair one came and fled. Like sunny gleams that each the last pursue; And yet that glad succession brought no change; Each child in turn was wilful, sweet, and strange. Older, beyond her island bounds she strayed Despite the king; for, ever since her birth, Of nought that tender heart had been afraid: Banshee, or ghost, she heard of, now with mirth And now with awe, but never with affright; And gladly would have faced them if she might. Not so old Levarcam! a spasm of dread Oft blanched her cheek remembering Conor's word, ‘Keep safe the child or forfeit is thy head!’ In Deirdré's absence, if a leaf but stirred She shook, and endless tales and legends told To keep her young lamb safe within the fold. She told how first, from regions of the morn With black-sailed ships stemming the ocean tide To Erin's forest yet of men forlorn Came Partholan, the Grecian Parricide: And how the ill race had perished. Deirdré cried With reddening cheek; ‘Glad am I that they died!’ Then, with a brightening in her old, pale face, Her nurse resumed: ‘But we—the Gael—but we, The offspring are we of a lordlier race, The heirs of some diviner destiny! King Miledh was our sire! From far Espán His dauntless sons led forth the Gaedil clan.’ Of Scota next she told, the widowed Queen; And how that sad one left her lonely throne Girt by eight sons; and how with eye serene She marked above the wine-black ocean prone Sea-monsters rise; nor feared to watch the wave Heaven-high, anon descending to its grave. Time on her brow had graved no characters; Sorrow no splendour stol'n from that wide eye That ever, as the legend old avers, Reposed on some far seat of sovereignty By others hoped;—to her alone revealed Beyond sea-cloud, and ocean's heaving field. She saw the waves engulf the drowning decks; Yet nought could scare that eye or blanch that cheek: Four sons she saw upon their mastless wrecks High driven on Erin's rocks and headlands bleak From Inver Scena to the House of Donn: She said; ‘The price is paid; the Isle is won!’ She saw the victory's prelude and no more; Half-way 'twixt ocean marge and mountain crest Where sleep the Great Ones of the days of yore Early she made her venerable rest, And holds, well-pleased, an ever spreading fame, Sealing a mighty people with her name. The Irish, for centuries ‘Scoti,’ were so called from Scota. Not all the themes were war; the fabler told Of Feale, the dusk-eyed beauty of the South, By Lewy won 'mid olive forests old: Such minstrelsies went freshening from his mouth That in his hand her own the princess placed, Nor feared, his wife, to dare the wan sea-waste. She told how, later, by that northern tide A blush of causeless shame her cheek had stained; And how, heart-grieved at fancied guilt, she died, Where wrong was none; and how her husband plained Year after year, while she, at Scota's feet, Rested revered where earth and ocean meet. Next told she how for Tara's King they found No consort worthy of the royal bed From east to west through Erin's utmost bound; And how, dream-warned, the youth had northward sped: And how, from fountain-bower by Fairy Brugh, A white maid looked on him with eyes of blue. And how that beauteous phantom, Eadane, Had laid a hand like light upon his hair: And next, lest he should die of yearnings vain, Assumed a woman's form though woven of air, And borne him pretty babes within their bower; Yet bade him oft beware the destined hour. And how at Tara, while the nobles sate Gracing his feast, that queen sent forth a cry: And how the Fairy-King through guards and gate Passed swiftly mailed in dew-like jewelry And like a whirlwind bore in sight of all That Fairy Princess to her father's hall! While thus the tales ran on the years ran by, Tales, some of sadness, some of mirth and jest, Till now the child to maiden prime was nigh: The tales of war and wonder pleased her best: The love-tales well began, no doubt: yet all Ended, she thought, in something slight and small. And still whate'er she heard of good and pure Within the virgin's memory held its place Like names on tree-stems graved that aye endure: Of questionable things survived no trace: They passed, like letters written in a rill That upward laughs to heaven, re-virgined still. One day it chanced that, while the March wind's breath Was softening round the daffodil's first bud, Their shepherd old had saved a lamb from death, And slain the wolf, and in their gateway stood; And, as the wounded creature bled, below A crimson blood-pool stained the last night's snow. Sudden there swooped to earth a raven black, And feasted on that blood. As in a dream The maiden watched it long: at last she spake, Whilst o'er her grave face ran a laughing gleam, ‘These be Love's colours, black and red, and white;— Yet Love, we know, is nought when judged aright! ‘These be Love's colours, white and black, and red:— Some little foolish maid, to love inclined, Might say: “Though all should love me none shall wed Until in one dear face those three I find; Not raven locks alone, or front of snow, But on the heroic cheek the battle's glow!”’ Beside the girl stood Levarcam; she smiled, And spake: ‘Good sooth, your shaft hath hit its mark; Yea doubtless, you were born a prophet's child! For Naisi's front is white, his tresses dark; And still of him men say, “On Naisi's cheek Not roses, but red dawns of battles break!”’ Then to the flash from Deirdré's peerless eyes Her nurse made answer: ‘Naisi, who is he? Warrior there treads not under Erin's skies But knows the man! the swiftest of those Three! They need no hounds; afoot they chase, each morn, The stag, and downward drag him head and horn! ‘Ever at Uladh's feasts the clansmen say, “Place ye the sons of Usnach side by side, A rock behind them, or some cromlech grey, Then blow a trump o'er Erin far and wide, And range her hosts against them, face to face, Those Three shall hew them down or homeward chase!” ‘Their singing is the best all Uladh boasts; Of all her sons most courteous they and kind, To heaven devoutest of her countless hosts: Softly along his path they lead the blind; Submission made, they scorn to avenge the ill Nor ever kissed a maid against her will. ‘To these the clans send embassies from far Laden with gifts, and suing, “Grant us aid! Rule us in battle's hour, and head our war!” But women say, “How well their mother prayed For sons both mild and valiant!” Lo, a ray Of her sweet countenance lives in theirs this day!’ Here Levarcam a moment stopped for breath; Then Deirdré rose and sought the neighbouring strand: Ice-bound it was, and cold that hour as death: To her 'twas warm as mead by May breeze fanned: She paced along its pebbly beach for hours; And to her feet its shingles felt like flowers. Returned, more lofty looked she than at morn; With more of inward gladness, yet less gay; More confident, though thawed, her girlish scorn In some half womanhood's benigner ray: Smiling, she met her nurse's smile, and then, ‘Naisi,’ she said, ‘will love me! Who cares when?!’ The maiden paused; she mused; again she spake, Fixing on Levarcam those marvellous eyes; ‘Three by Love's colours—white, and red, and black: White for the sake of Love's white sanctities: And red, for Love must war on many a foe; And black, since Love, though crowned, must end in woe.’ Again she mused:—‘Yes, Love must war! Who fears? Though Love must fight, he fights in love, not hate! Some glorious conflict rages through the years; Great Love must take therein his part, elate: And woe comes last. On raven pinions borne Night comes not less:—but after night comes morn!’ From that time Naisi's name she named no more; Nothing she seemed to lack; nothing to crave: Her heart through spiritual realms was strong to soar, Self-lifted as o'er windless seas the wave; A spirit of strength from earthly bonds escaped She trod; her body's self but spirit draped; A spirit of strength and swiftness onward borne Through luminous realms all resonant and free, Happier because unwinged, like endless morn With silver feet circling the spherèd sea: And still her lonely thought with song was blent; And bird-like still she warbled as she went. For music then, like warfare, not from art Grew up laborious:—born of frank good-will 'Twas Joy's loud clarion in the generous heart; Through pains more perfect grew the harper's skill, Yet still from purest soul, and bravest breast The minstrelsy came brightest still and best. Deirdré besides, on Naisi's music musing— That strain far-famed she once had heard in dream— Through some strange craft of Nature's sweet infusing Unconscious copied it. A lily's gleam Shines thus, reflected in the lake below, More softly, green for green, and snow for snow. One morn she marked two mated eagles flying Far from their cliff, her little lake above, Sunward in strength, and clapped her hands loud crying, ‘On, wedded Spirits, on! for this is Love! No woodland murmurs yours, and thraldom none! Sail on till buried in the ascending sun!’ That vision shaped her life. Through wild and wood That day, but later, Naisi chased the stag: It took the wave and vanished: silent stood At noon the hunter on a jutting crag: His eye upon a tower-crowned island fell; Thereon it fastened, bound as by a spell. ‘There lies,’ he mused, ‘that wondrous-countenanced child, Like some poor bird a captive from its birth, In that lone island year by year exiled: How little she suspects her grace and worth! Our household foe ere long will clutch that hand— Is yon a causeway leading to the land?’ An hour had fled, and lo! that bridge he paced; Ere long, no child, but, sparkling like a flower, The imprisoned maid nor startled nor shame-faced Passed by the youth, advancing from her bower With breeze-like step, yet down-dropp'd lids of snow: ‘Ah foot,’ he cried, ‘more light than foot of doe!’ An instant back she flashed her magic eyes And from her laughing lip the answer leaped, ‘Where stags are none, the doe must monarchise!’ Some ballad old it was, but never steeped Till then with such strange sweetness to his ear: Was it reproof or challenge, vague yet dear? Naisi rejoined: ‘A monarch rules this land; For you he destines Erin's proudest throne! Ah, but for that how many a warrior's brand’— She spake; ‘His realm is his: my heart mine own: A maiden I have lived: maiden would die:’ The warrior fixed on hers his strong grey eye. That eye, though young and sweet with such clear light, Had marshalled many a death-strewn battle-field; Had watched the meeting tides of many a fight; Taught many a proud, inviolate fort to yield. With gaze as frank his gaze thus answered she, ‘I know you well! the eldest of those Three! ‘Where are your brothers? She whom nurse I call Has told me all the Three are kind and brave: Fain would I sister be to each and all: Fain too my life from love tyrannic save!’ ‘Their sister you shall be,’ the youth replied; ‘Mine if you will; but none the less my bride!’ He spake; then, for the maiden's safety fearing With passion changed continued: ‘Spurn my suit! The king will slay thee!’ She, the warrior nearing Held forth both hands and gazed upon him mute; And last, in love's high truth—and truth is best— Made answer, ‘Thine!’ He snatched her to his breast. Thence lifting soon a countenance glad yet tearful She spake: ‘Your knighthood stands consummate now! Since a true maid, of Conor's wrath not fearful, Has heard and with her own has crowned your vow. Forth, on your task decreed! Fly hence, and prove Ten years in battle-fields what might hath Love! ‘In ten years bring me back your trophied spoils From every land and clime; for mine they are! I that inspired can well requite your toils: Ever till then my spirit like a star O'er you shall hang! Farewell, yet, ere you go, Sing! for how great your songs long since I know.’ So, hand in hand, upon that causeway standing, Those youthful lovers measure after measure Poured forth, their bosoms more and more expanding At once with music's zeal, and love's pure pleasure; For Deirdré still her voice with Naisi's twined, All-perfect harmony though undesigned. And though till then no war-song she had sung That hour her song grew warlike as his own! And, o'er her heaven-like beauty as he hung, His war-songs tender grew and sweet of tone: And still they sang, till now through woodlands ringing The men of Erin east and west came winging, And found those lovers in that lonely haunt, That sunset glowing round them and above; And saw the forests flash, the blue waves pant; And heard that mingled praise of war and love: Then ceased that pair, and softly smiled, and said, ‘What makes us glad is this: we two are wed!’ But when, to many a questioner replying, They found that they had only met that noon The lovers laughed a sweet-voiced laughter, crying, ‘We thought we had been wedded many a moon! Great love it seems lives long in little time; Yet shall great love be ever in his prime! ‘Perchance of us some future bard shall say, “Their bright, swift life went o'er them like a breath Of stormy southwind in the merry May; And brief their unfeared, undivided death:” For unto those who love, and love aright, Life is Love's day; and Death his long, sweet night.’ But straight the men of Erin cried aloud, ‘The king, the king!’ and Naisi's brothers twain, Ainli and Ardan, though to help him vowed At need, not less to break that troth were fain: The king they named not. Cathbad long ago Foretold that Babe was born for Uladh's woe! Yet, when within those lovers' eyes they saw Wild mirth alone, and blank astonishment, They deemed the thing divine; and, though with awe, Their spirits on the high adventure bent, And council took, and with one mind decreed That self-same night o'er Uladh's bound to speed. This therefore was the order of their going: A hundred warriors marching in the van; A hundred maidens next with veils loose flowing; A hundred clansmen last of Usnach's clan, And each a greyhound leading in a cord; Swiftly with these they trod the moonlit sward. So well were Usnach's sons both loved and feared King Conor could but rail against the wrong: All round the isle they marched with banner reared, And trumpet blown, and many a tale and song, Welcomed in court and camp both near and far, From Esro's Ballyshannon. Fall to sea-beat Binedar. Howth. Nathless through Conor's craft such toils were woven 'Twixt them and Erin's Kings, to spare that wrong Felt at low hearths when royal pacts are cloven, They drew to northern Moyle a fleet ere long, And spread their sails from Kermnah Dûn, and o'er The grey-green billows sailed to Alba's shore. When Conor heard the warriors were departed He smiled. From rigid lips austere and thin Keen as a poignard's gleam that smile forth darted, Mute witness of an edict vowed within:— ‘They 'scape,’ thus mused he; ‘yet their hour is nigh: This long lean arm shall drag them back to die.’ CANTO III. THE SONS OF USNACH IN ALBA. O noble Alba, Scotia later named Then when the race of Scota and her Lord O'er all thy holy isles and highlands famed Had raised the Gaelic harp, the Gaelic sword, And Kenneth, Pictish rule extinct, had reared That throne of kings for centuries revered! Great land of Alba! in that hour supreme Conqueror, not conquered, wert thou! Thy great heart, Flinging from off it, like a nightmare dream, A sway ignobler, chose the better part, Throning the lofty spirit in lofty place: It brought thee bliss and bale, but nothing base! When, centuries earlier, stood on Alba's coast Usnach's brave sons, her king received them well: Treaty they made: they joined to his their host, And taught him soon the insurgent tribes to quell, Yet still they loved him not: ‘His soul is mean,’ They said; ‘by him shall Deirdré ne'er be seen.’ Yet near his court they dwelt; and once it chanced A palace churl while o'er the forest boughs New leaved the earliest beam of morning glanced, Made way, with missive sped, to Naisi's house, And on by dusky doors, though timorous, crept, And found at last that room where Naisi slept. Before its stony threshold slumbering lay Ainli and Ardan, clasping, each, a sword, For ever wont were these by night and day Their brother and their sister thus to ward: The intruder o'er them stepped and entrance made To where in sleep that princely pair were laid. Between them stretched from pillow on to pillow The massive trail of Deirdré's luminous hair, Like gold-touched tendrils of a budded willow Breeze-blown against the dawn. Already there The greedy, youngling sunrise made his feast, Though still in cloud half muffled was the East. Longer that churl had stood save that in sleep Growled the great wolf-hound couched beside the bed: The traitor turned; and, skilled to crawl and creep, Reached the half open gates, and homeward fled, And found the king new-risen, and nodding spake, ‘Rejoice, great monarch, for thy kingdom's sake! ‘Till now thou hast not found a woman meet In all thy land the royal throne to share; Behold, the loveliest lady and most sweet Of all the earth is near, and thou not 'ware! Compared with her the rest are sheep and kine— Bid Naisi die! his consort crown as thine!’ Then told the man his tale from first to last With added circumstance. The Pict replied Well pleased, albeit at Naisi's name aghast, ‘To slay that chief were hard; to snare his bride Were sweet. In secret traffic with her! Say, She must be first my love; my queen one day!’ Forth sped the accursed one on his mission foul, And came on Deirdré singing all alone, And took his stand, ill visaged as a Ghoul, And named the terms, base love and future throne: And she with darkening eyes no word replied Save this alone: ‘Till I return, abide!’ Swiftly she walked: she came where stood the Three; Then from her white lips rushed her wrong like flame: ‘Dishonoured wife!’ she cried, ‘with me, with me, Though not the treason, lives for aye the shame! Ah, surely never wife such scorn has known Unless the fault was first in part her own!’ But Naisi smiled, forth issuing with his brand, And said but this: ‘Abide till I return;’ And soon, that head ill-omened in his hand, Came back with countenance bright, at once and stern: Then Deirdré spake, ‘My hand had borne that freight If thine had spared it! At the bad king's gate ‘Lay first that head, and march we hence this night!’ The Brothers answered: ‘No! nor yet three days!’ Three days in scorn they paced a neighbouring height: Three days the Pict, thus challenged, stood at gaze, And ofttimes grimly turned from lord to lord: They answered nought; nor any raised his sword. But when the fourth dawn o'er the forest soaring Sent through the heavens divergent beams of splendour, Upon the earth glory and gladness pouring, That host arose; nor took they farewell tender: Three stones the clansmen, each, above his head Flung backward far in scorn: then forth they sped. And, lest the sun should dazzle Deirdré's eyes, Westward that morn their pilgrimage began: First, under standards bright with myriad dyes A hundred Usnach warriors led the van: Maids next: then clansmen, holding, each, a hound That strained against the leash with bark and bound. Ere long their march was through the misty highlands: They tracked Glenorchy's immemorial woods; Loch Lomond's bosky mountain-skirts and islands; Birch-braided Katrine's sylvan solitudes; And where on shores of Fyne, now low now higher, With punctual tide the salt sea floods respire. Meantime the natives of those lonely regions Came fiercely forth from many a distant shore Though worsted oft, in ever thickening legions; Ere long the rumour rushed the ocean o'er: Thenceforth there flocked from Uladh's coast in swarms Her noblest youth, clan Usnach's mates in arms. For there, beside the spring her pitcher watching, The maid would sing of Naisi's strength and fleetness, Ofttimes in turn on breeze of evening catching Some shepherd's song of Deirdré's truth and sweetness: And still they ended, each: ‘Ill deed, King Conor, That banished such! Alas, the land's dishonour!’ The exiles nothing grudged that storm of war, In victory glad, not downcast in defeat: Three winter months when fortune pressed them sore Within a western isle they made retreat, The nearest of those emerald Hebrides Set 'mid the crystal splendour of the seas. Returned, with varying fortune raged the feud: Clan Usnach triumphed now: anon the foe: And oft, a swordless warrior mild of mood, Amid those Three was Deirdré seen: and lo! Still as the radiance bickers round the gem So flashed the battle's flame round her and them. She smote not; yet she conquered. Victory's sun Where'er she moved upon their banners played: Full half the realm the Uladh warriors won: Her face inspired them! Peace ere long they made— Laughing that hour they swore their songs between ‘King Conor's Exile shall be Alba's Queen!’ It was that season when the spirit of joy Runs million-footed forth through earth and air; When the hale shepherd grows once more the boy; The girl-like youth is prompt to do and dare; When womanhood looks softer than its wont; The star shines whiter from the infant's front. It was that season when the maiden's heart, Though guarded, faster beasts against its bound; When Love's long hidden fount, by happier art Divined, is nearer to the surface found: When to the faded cheek returns its bloom; And tears less bitter stain the flower-decked tomb. It was that season when on fields late dreary Thickest at dawn the awakened daisy throngeth, When in the dim sweet gloaming, never weary Latest the darkling thrush her song prolongeth; And pillow-spurning children fret for morn Fresh flowers, new leaves, and ecstacies re-born. Ah then to Naisi, and to Deirdré then Like fire the gladness of the spring-tide came: That causeway old they seemed to tread again, Sang the same song! Love's wild, yet vestal flame Caught them once more as on that first of May; And three glad wedded years became a day. Then, dawn by dawn, ere yet the low-tongued wind From unreluctant buds their balm was wooing, While earliest shafts through ragged fissures blind Of cloud forth flashed, the flying night pursuing, Those brothers and that sister clomb the crag And blew the horn, and roused the antlered stag. O joy his course through woodland gulfs to follow Deirdré and they, to Etive's salt sea lake! To hear from shadowy cliff and cavern hollow Through glistening air that horn's far echoes break, And mark, o'er wide green plain, and purple mere The mountain-wall its glooming bastion rear More high when seen through mist: to watch it quivering; From rock to cloud to track the eagle's flight; And then, close by, on spray shining and shivering To note the tender-footed bird alight, Or flower down-bending 'neath the silenced bee, Or gleam from rill remote on-winding noiselessly! O joy, to hear in woods the loud hounds baying, Or plunge of floods adown some hoarse ravine! To watch the level wave o'er sea-ledge swaying; Thence refluent dragged in trails of grassy green; Or, farther yet, that surge forever hoary Seething round lone tormented promontory! Three tents they planted where the forest's skirt Sheltered the lowland from the increasing heat; In one, with hand assiduous and expert Deirdré prepared that food by toil made sweet; In one they held their banquet; and in one Sang their glad songs till half the night was done. And many a night on Etive's flowery margin She moved, while moonbeams glazed the purple wave, Blithest of wives; light-footed as a virgin; Or at the entrance of some ivied cave Sang note prolonged that ended oft in laughter— Sweet were the days, pledging some sweet hereafter! One night, when Naisi to his rest had passed, Deirdré, long lingering at the bridal door, Her eyes on Ainli and on Ardan cast, Great eyes with tears unused all misted o'er, And took their hands, and spake in low, soft tone ‘To you my Naisi's weal is as your own! ‘But you, like Naisi, must have, each, your bride, Unhumbled maids not willing to be wed, To walk in glorying gladness at your side: Find such, and I round each a silver thread Will twine; and bring the creatures to you bound: Discrowned the proud must be; and Love be crowned!’ CANTO IV. THE KING'S TREASON. The heroic song hath sorrows, but not sighs; The heroic legend tender is, yet hard; With grief alike, and joy, can sympathise; Yet keeps the heroic heart from weakness barred. Love's strenuous gale for three glad years had blown: Then Fate, that rules the nations, claimed her own. Thus it befell; once more at Conor's call The Red Branch Knights partook his birthday feast, Ranged 'neath their standards round Emania's hall; And when at last the hunger rage had ceased, Song after song rang out in turn and died Far echoed; and the warriors' shout replied. But 'mid the triumph, 'mid the jest, the laugh, The minstrel chaunt, and flash of boastful wit, Sad as a snow-flecked grave-stone's epitaph Were Conor's wintry face and brow close-knit; And ever round that various-vested scene His stern grey eye wandered with inquest keen. He mused; they love the Usnach clan, not me; Those Three that daily lure my best away; That filched my Bride; my kingdom's fall decree; Make broad their Alban borders day by day:— But highest while they soar, that brood accurst, The bolt of my revenge shall on them burst! Thus musing, sudden in his eye there shone A baleful gleam: for as the loud-voiced pack In frosty woods long baffled, finds anon The scent, and follows fast the trail and track, Even so King Conor's thoughts, ravening for aye At last, though far, had glimpsed their destined prey. He rose: ‘How say ye, Lords! With plainness speak— Give counsel true and courtly scruples quell: Find ye in Uladh aught decayed or weak, Amiss, or lacking? Or are all things well?’ And they made answer: ‘All things right we find, Nor aught deficient. King, we speak our mind!’ Yet once again King Conor rose and said, ‘My mind is other-minded, Lords, than yours; For I, though ne'er by random counsel swayed, Far less by murmurs low of kernes and boors, Find this amiss; that Usnach's sons this day For one bad woman's sake are far away; ‘A loss to Uladh, and to me the most Losing each month our bravest.’ Then the acclaim Burst louder thrice from that exulting host; And thus they cried: ‘We feared the royal blame, And therefore hid our counsel; but that morn Those Three return, old Uladh stands re-born.’ Again the plot-deviser rose and spake: ‘Men of great stomachs, Lords, we count those Three: “Exiles,” they sware, “we go: but ne'er come back Till sureties strong are ours, and guarantee By Conor sent, firm pledge of endless troth:” Thus Naisi sware: and sacred is an oath. ‘Likewise thus vowed he, ne'er to tread again Green Erin's soil, his glory and his joy, Till Conal Carnach fetched him o'er the main, Or else Cuchullain, or the son of Roy, Fergus, my dearest. I these three will test, And learn by proof which loves King Conor best.’ Then Conor unto Conal signed; and these Stood speaking in a casement far apart: ‘Conal, if I should send thee o'er the seas, And lo! on Uladh's soil, through Naisi's heart The Fates sent darkness, what would happen then?’ And Conal answered: ‘Deaths of many men! ‘King! if he fell, of Uladh's sons one-half For Naisi's sake would lie ere three days dead, And for my surety broken.’ With a laugh King Conor filliped Conal's cheek, and said, ‘Fool! that canst never understand a jest! Go hence! It is not thou that lov'st me best!’ Next, to Cuchullain Conor signed; then spake: ‘Cuchullain! if I sent thee o'er the sea, With Usnach's exiled sons a pact to make, And then, despite thy surety given, those Three Vanished, late-landed; what would happen then?’ Cuchullain answered: ‘Deaths of many men! ‘For, not alone who wrought that deed accursed Slaying those Three, should perish by this hand, But they the impious deed who counselled, first; And, next the man who issued that command!’ Then Conor frowned:—‘What night-mare loads thy breast? Hence, for thou know'st me not; nor lov'st me best!’ To Fergus last the royal plotter signed, And made, yet softlier tuned, the self-same quest; But he the questioner's meaning nought divined A prince whose heart, as naked as his crest, Contemned disguise; suspecting treachery none Thus answered Fergus, Roy's once sceptred son: ‘King, thou, and I, and Usnach's sons must die— What matters when, if spotless our good name? The hand that strikes in daylight I defy; If traitor's knife attempts their lives, that shame All Uladh's race shall expiate save alone That stained, yet guiltless king on Uladh's throne!’ Then Conor caught his hand: ‘Thou, sole of all Lov'st me! The rest but fear: they never loved! Cautious are they: thou swift at honour's call! Now therefore be thy love and fealty proved: To Alba speed: bring home those exiled Three, Thyself their surety, pledge, and guarantee. ‘But with them plight this covenant beside, That instant when they tread my kingdom's strand To me they speed; with no man else abide; Favour or feast accept at no man's hand: My bread must be the first those exiles break; All griefs thenceforth forgotten for its sake. ‘I charge thee too from Alba's coast returned To land at Barach's castle in the north; There shall thy monarch's further will be learned:’ Then Fergus pledged his word, and issued forth: But Conor beckoned Barach from the feast; Then long time stood a-gazing North and East. Low-toned he spake: ‘Barach! a keep thou hast There where the grey cliffs break the northern brine: When Fergus comes from Alba hold him fast: Heap high thy banquet; make that proud one thine! If from thy board he turns he stands forsworn, By Geisa bound These Gesa, or Geisa, often as trivial in character as they were rigidly enforced, have a large place in the legends of the Irish pre-Christian times. Sometimes they applied to particular individuals alone: thus, in the case of Cuchullain, it was a Gesa that no one should wake him out of his sleep. Sometimes they were self-imposed: thus Fergus Mac Roy and Cuchullain also, had bound themselves in youth never to refuse an invitation to the feast of a good man, however humble. The most remarkable illustrations of the Gesa will be found in ‘Conary,’ the noble poem of my friend, Sir Samuel Ferguson, who speaks of them as ‘certain sacred injunctions, the violation of which was attended with temporal punishment. The agents in inflicting such retribution appear in the form of Fairies.’ (Poems by Sir Samuel Ferguson, p. 61. McGee, Dublin; George Bell, London.) no good man's feast to scorn. ‘But thou, the sons of Usnach send to me: What cause I have to trust that race thou knowest: Be sure thy feast hold out two days or three: My love thenceforth thou hast where'er thou goest.’ The courtier smiled, and bowed, ‘I hear, and heed:’ And Conor thus: ‘True friend is friend at need!’ Next morning Fergus o'er the waters sped At earliest dawn; with him his sons alone, Illan the Fair; Buini the Ruthless Red, His shield-bearer, the third. By swift winds blown They rushed above the waves a day and night; At dawn Loch Etive's mountains loomed in sight. Ere noon he landed on the Alban coast: Wild from the woods a stag there issued bounding; The prince his mission grave forgat, and tossed Through the green-caverned forest loud-resounding As he was ever wont, his hunting cry; And lo! the tents where Naisi dwelt were nigh. Deirdré and he were playing chess together Chess was the favourite game of the Irish in early times.: Their bending heads nigh met above the board; While sunny gleams of that unclouded weather Glancing through boughs the chequered ivory scored. Her brow was bright with thought; her hand, raised high, Above its destined prize hung hoveringly. The cry of Fergus reached them. Naisi spake: ‘Erin! A son of Erin breathed that shout!’ Deirdré replied: ‘Not so! On Etive's lake Some fisher boasts a spoil, or chieftain's scout Welcomes his fellows far away. Play on!’ She laughed; but from her cheek the rose was gone. Once more abroad the cry of Fergus pealed; And Naisi cried: ‘Our Erin nursed that voice!’ Then Deirdré: ‘Nay, but from some rock-girt field Loud-voiced the shepherd bids his mates rejoice: Some boar is slain, or wolf that vexed the land: Play on!’ And on her heart she pressed her hand. But when a third time rang that shout, now nearer The three brave brothers recognised the sound, And listening, larger grew their eyes, and clearer, And from their seats they leaped, and gazed around, And smote their palms and clamoured, ‘O the joy! Fergus is come! Our Fergus! Fergus Roy!’ Then Naisi sent the twain abroad to meet him; But Deirdré said, ‘I knew that earliest cry! Woe to the man, and them this hour who greet him! This day the bolt is launched from yonder sky: This day the Destiny foretold beginneth: Woe to the Three! Worst woe to him who sinneth! ‘All night I saw three birds from Erin's peaks To Alba strain through tempest and eclipse: Three honey-drops they wafted on their beaks:— O Love! they dropped that sweetness on thy lips; Ere long each death-black wing, and gold-crowned head With life-blood from thy heart, O Love, was red!’ She rose: on visions dread she seemed to stare! She stood: she pressed her hands upon her eyes: From the wan brows the horror-stricken hair Like angry meteors rose, or seemed to rise; She towered aloft a prophetess; till, near, The step well known of Fergus smote their ear. She whispered low: ‘Trample the honeyed lure! Make not with Conor! He will have thy blood!’ A moment more, and, entering from the moor Fergus, that royal presence, by them stood: The cloud fell from her! Basking like blue sky She met her husband's guest full lovingly. There stood they, Fergus loftiest by the head, His sons beside him, stalwart men, and tall, Illan the Fair, Buini the Ruthless Red: Reverent and sweet she kissed them, each and all, She and the Brothers: next they made demand Of Erin's weal—Erin, their native land. Swift came the answer: ‘Friends, the news is this: The king repents him of the ignoble deed That cost his realm her bravest; zealous is To quench that deed, and cancel; hath decreed That you and yours, henceforth and evermore Shall live secure on Erin's sacred shore: ‘Likewise of this, a kingdom's oath and pledge, I stand myself, surety and guarantee: Conor in turn, to dull past injury's edge Demands, implores a single vow from thee, That till beside his board thou breakest bread No meaner house than his shall roof thy head.’ Then Naisi and the brethren rose in joy; But Deirdré came before them speaking thus: ‘King—for, except the race and stock of Roy, O'er Uladh kings may reign, but not o'er us— The eagle lives not save in large domain: These Three have won this land, and here must reign! ‘King Conor caught and caged me, yet a child; King Conor into exile drave these Three; To pardon is not to be reconciled: The sentenced man shall stand absolved; but we Desire a healthier breeze than makes resort Within the perfumed precinct of a court.’ ‘Lady, you doubt the safety of your Lord!— “Must reign!” I reign no more; not less my Name Would move in might before him like a sword Though all the hosts of Erin 'gainst him came!’ A red spot stood on Fergus' crownless brow; The Three looked up; and spake: ‘We go, and now!’ Then Deirdré inly said, ‘We go to die:’ Death-pale she stood, yet spake no further word; Their promise pledged, albeit unwittingly, The worst that might befall them she preferred To treason's semblance and a vow forsworn: She spread the board; westward they sailed ere morn. And ever as the wine-dark seas they clave The sons of Usnach stood upon the prow And spread their arms to Erin o'er the wave; And each to each exclaimed: ‘To guide the plough Or break the clod, still breathing Erin's air Were better than to rule and reign elsewhere!’ But Deirdré stood upon the vessel's stern Alone, with eyes on Alba's headlands bent Dreaming the hills she could no more discern, And as they faded thus she made lament: ‘O Land, our home no more, to me and mine Gentle thou wert: therefore my heart is thine! ‘O beauteous Land, oft on thy heathery bed, Wearied with chase, upon my sleepless heart My Naisi laid at noon his sleeping head; And therefore thine I am; and dear thou art. I came to thee with Naisi hand in hand, But now no more I see thee, beauteous Land! ‘O Coona! 'mid thy bursting buds the thrush Sang well in spring! In thee the autumnal berry Sent forth its flash from reddening brake and bush Like scoff from hard old lip of beldam merry! We laughed to mark it, while far off we heard Ainli with Ardan sing as bird with bird. ‘Glenorchy, O Glenorchy! sweet in thee To hear the cuckoo's note, that glad new-comer; And sweet o'er Masan's sands to watch the sea Sleep on unwakened half the long, blue summer! Thou gav'st us, O thou Erin of the East! The song, the chase, the battle, and the feast! ‘Loch Etive, O Loch Etive! near thy shore, Lulled by thy waters pure, and airs heart-healing, Latest we lived, who live there now no more; Earliest in thee we raised our little shieling: Good things the Sons of Usnach gat from thee, And I, the ill-omened Sister of the Three!’ Thus in her song honouring the land she loved Sad Deirdré stood while back the waters hoar Streamed from the ship, and singing never moved: From her chilled lip the wind its music bore, Till plainly Erin's cliffs at last shone forth And Barach's castle facing to the North. Then Barach, as that fated bark drew near, With courteous seeming but a purpose fell Sailed forth to meet it making goodly cheer With bannered boat and tossing coracle So densely clustered that the billow green Betwixt them scarcely showed its sparkling sheen. Ere long the exiles leaped on Erin's strand: The courtier followed fast: with loud-voiced glee He bade them welcome to their native land And kissed the hands of each full reverently, Deirdré's the last; and said, ‘Your home is here! Abide a week and after that a year!’ But when the Brothers told him of their oath In no man's house to eat or rest their head, Howe'er to slight a friendly welcome loth Until with Conor they had broken bread, He turned to Fergus;—‘Oath thou too hast sworn, Thy Geisa oath, no humblest feast to scorn. ‘Behold, for thee this day my board is decked; My dish is garnished; and my fatlings slain: Likewise to greet thee many a chief elect Rides fast to-day from distant vale and plain: If vain their zeal, a mock that loyal haste, My father's house henceforward stands disgraced.’ 'Twas true! That Geisa oath—so Fancy glozed That day in Erin—with such rites was fenced Whether from heaven the vow, or self-imposed So iron-bound with sanctions undispensed, The man who spurned it, like the man who fled The battle's front, thenceforth was as the dead. This Fergus knew: he stood in anguish mute, His giant bulk bowed by his spirit's pain That ever downward worked from scalp to foot: Like stag whom serpent folds begin to strain He stood—that strives in vain that coil to break— And flame was on his face while thus he spake: ‘Ill done, ill done, O Barach, is thy deed! Ill-timed, ill-omened, and unblest thy feast:’ Then Barach; ‘Let those Three to Conor speed; The king is greatest here, and I am least: But thou—thine oath that later pledge foreran: If broke, it lays thine honour under ban.’ Still Fergus mused;—‘'Tis true: that oath I made; Made ere an upstart's craft had filched my crown: To break it were my greatness to degrade, To blot a princely birth, a life's renown: Uladh would cry, “He shames the blood of Roy To 'scape the frown of Nessa's ill-crowned boy!”’ Doubt bred new doubt:—away the False One strode; But Fergus still mused on and never stirred, His royal head depressed and neck embowed; At last he turned to Naisi with this word: ‘My friend, speak thou!’ But ere her lord replied, Deirdré spake first, with queenly port and pride: ‘The choice is thine, not his; and this that choice; For a feast's sake to cast from thee thy charge Subject and servile to a courtier's voice; Or spurn that feast, and walk, a soul at large.’ And Fergus said, ‘My sons with thine and thee Might ride. I bind on them my guarantee.’ Low-toned he spake; but Naisi heard, and thus Made answer, reddening like a rising moon: ‘We scorn their aid! Our swords suffice for us! All help beside we count a worthless boon!’ Then Fergus frowned: by wrath from doubt released With them he sent his sons and joined the feast. Yet Fergus all that day at heart was sore Since of all men he loved the best those Three; And, though he mused, ‘We meet in two days more Despite all Geisas,’ mute at feast sat he: And thrice he heard that night, an hour ere morn, That Banshee's shriek heard when that Babe was born. CANTO V. THE NIGHT RIDE TO EMANIA. So forth the Brothers rode, while high o'erhead Through that primeval forest's woven screen Now in long lanes the sky its radiance shed And now in purple stars of splendour keen; Not far behind them marched the Usnach clan Loud singing and on-trampling like one man. But Deirdré, slowly lifting eyes divine Dewed with dark tears, upon the Brothers, spake: ‘True counsel, lo! I give you, brothers mine; And yet that counsel true ye will not take; There shine the rocks of Rathlin! On its shore Abide till this disastrous feast is o'er!’ Then spake to Illan, Fergus' kindlier son, The Ruthless Red: ‘Small faith in us they place!’ Whom Naisi hearing, made reply, ‘Ride on!’ And Deirdré raised to heaven her heaven-sweet face, And made this song; for, as in girlhood, all Her musings, dark or bright, grew musical. ‘O would my Love were safe in some far isle! And I were like some shadow passed away; Yea, though some other liegeful wife, the while, Partook his board at eve, his chase by day: For I am that doomed Babe of long ago; And I on those fair Three have brought this woe! ‘One time by far Loch Etive—'twas in jest— My Naisi kissed a sweet-eyed Alban maid: I sought my death! my bark from crest to crest I dashed, too deeply wounded to upbraid! The Brothers saw, and followed fast—and I— Ah, that for me those peerless Three should die!’ Meanwhile all day in light discourse or deep The sons of Usnach and of Fergus rode, And came at eve to Fuad's mountain-steep; But Deirdré, bent for once by sorrow's load Though strong, behind them dropped, and on a bank Moon-lit sat down; and slumber on her sank. There Naisi found her 'neath a yew-tree old, Shivering; and she his steps approaching knew Though sleeping still; and through the moonlight cold T'wards him stretched forth her hand so kind and true; And, ‘What, O what is this,’ he said, ‘my Queen?’ Waking she answered, anguished yet serene: ‘A dream it was that kept me from thy side: Wakeful all day that dream I saw, and see: I saw King Fergus' sons beside us ride, Saw as they are, not that they seemed to thee: Illan a bleeding bulk without a head, I saw: yet true he proved when traitors fled. ‘Buini I saw, the Ruthless Red; full strong He towered, and stately as a summer tree: But, when that strife dishonest did us wrong No help he proved, O Love, to thine and thee! So one was faithful, yet of greatness shorn: And one was greatness perjured and forsworn. ‘Thou knowest that, from a child, with me was vision; That truth I knew, I saw; and see it yet: Child changed to maid—one hour's divine transition— I saw thy face and knew it when we met: No lettered lore was mine; yet what must be Ever I saw. Who seeth must foresee. ‘Now ride we on!’ they rode for many an hour, Till through an oak-glade in that glimmering wood Forth loomed Emania veiled in cloud and shower: Above the edge of that black cloud there stood A moon nigh setting in a sanguine shroud; And many thunders heard they, far, not loud. Upon that sanguine shroud as on a sign Deirdré gazed long; then turned her eyes, and spake: ‘True counsel, lo! I give you, brothers mine, And yet that counsel true ye will not take; No further towards Emania ride this hour; Seek we, not far it stands, Cuchullain's tower! ‘Or house with Conal Carnach, leal and true: He to the court ere noon with us will ride— Naisi! when on that causeway I and you That evening sang, what prayer hadst thou denied?’ Yet, though she chid him, nearer him she crept: The one sole time that in his arms she wept! Buini drew near! At once the Three replied, ‘Because we never feared and cannot fear To Eman on we will whate'er betide!’ Unseen by him she wiped away her tear; While from the black boughs fell a poison-dew; And Fate her net more closely round them drew. Thenceforth was Deirdré changed. Emania's gate They reached as rose the sun, and blew their horn: Indifferent, yea, as one with either fate Content alike, she spake in careless scorn; ‘Omens the Druids find in bird and beast: A Druid I; a laughing one at least! ‘I doubted Conor's faith: if mine the fault Harbouring distrust, King Conor thus will speak: “Abide with me three months: partake my salt; Drink of my cup: my bread securely break!” If under alien roof he bids us lie Then know his pit is dug; and we shall die.’ She spake! around her lip a smile there curled; Her kindling eye was fixed as eye of one Who sees, beyond the limits of the world, Beyond the thresholds of our moon and sun, Beyond the abysmal night, a gleam of day And can abide the issue come what may. As thus they stood the gate was opened wide; Anon forth stepped a herald with this word: ‘Great Sirs, the king, himself by sickness tried, Within the Red Branch House hath decked your board With Uladh's best from mead and river brought:’ They on each other gazed, yet answered nought. ‘He bids you there with blessing.’ At that speech Silent they sought that House. In stately throng The knights received them: yet on brows of each Devoid of guile, a dubious sadness clung: Anon the seats were set; the tables spread; Nor ceased that revel till the day was sped. Not all partook it. Silent and apart In a huge window caverned from the wall By some high builder's long-forgotten art, Sat Deirdré, and the Brothers three. No thrall To royal craft the warriors now. What meant The king, they knew, and waited the event. Scorning to make complaint they scorned not less To share a traitor's feast, and ate of nought Waving each dish away in haughtiness Save little loaves that with them they had brought. Their chess-board next they ranged with pawn and queen; And Deirdré laughed or frowned the moves between. CANTO VI. THE FATE FULFILLED. At times it chanceth in the ways of men That, midmost at the crisis of great woes, The torrent pauseth ere its fall; again The horizon brightens ere the tempests close: The better Genius of our life draws nigh :— His warning scorned, next cometh destiny. 'Twas thus with Conor. Seated in his tower A mile from Eman near a wood-girt lake, Sudden the stillness of that eve had power Though not his heart to soften, yet to shake: Had it been earth's supremest hour, her death She had not faced with closelier-holden breath. No ripple broke against that castle's base: No passing gust darkened that crystal mere: No vapour dimmed that heaven's untroubled face: No dove was heard remote, no leaflet near. The external calm mocking that hell within Roused Conor's fear. Suspicion comes of sin. He sat and mused: ‘The cup is at my lip— What if some poison mingles with the wine? Forced as we are to drain our draught, not sip, Its after-might we know not, yet divine: To Fergus once the realm I sway belonged: This day I make forsworn whom then I wronged. ‘His wrath will be a wrath inexorable, For sacred was that pledge and guarantee He vowed but late to Usnach's sons. Unstable Is Fortune's grace. Cuchullain loves not me: Both he and Conal guessed my drift that hour: On brows of both I saw the vengeance lower.’ A second change traversed the Traitor's thought, And thus he drugged his spirit half-consciously; ‘What if I risk my all to gain a naught? Beauty dies soon; and beauteous once was she: My ruin she may prove; has proved my shame—’ He rose: ‘Send hither Levarcam!’ She came. She stood beside the man; and thus he spake: ‘Forth, since I spared thy life when Deirdré fled, And tidings bring me whether, for love's sake, Yet lives her beauty on that False One's head: The girl hath known rough skies and scanty board:’ Then Levarcam went forth, with wiles well stored. Drawing a thousand thoughts into one noose Of woman-craft she sped, in silks arrayed; And came with speed, such speed as age may use, To where at chess the death-doomed princes played In that high window; next one finger raised High as her brow; then round her peering gazed. Naisi she loved from childhood; loved scarce less His brothers; felt for Deirdré love and spleen:— ‘Through grace of yours, all-bashful Forwardness, Save for my craft this trunk had headless been! I wiled the sword from Conor's hand! Well, well! My Wanton's face retains its childish spell! ‘I come to you at peril of my life— Hush, hush! The thought was mine! They must not hear! With rumours dark Emania's streets are rife: The king has vowed your death:—draws any near? Then when the Babe was born, the seer foretold— What? Must men die because a maid was bold?’ In tears awhile the faded fine one stood; And next, mechanic-wise oracular, Kept nodding of her head. Then changed her mood To fires of youth. ‘Close gate, and casement bar! Fight well, ye sons of Fergus! If your sire Makes speed, he'll trample yet this flame in mire!’ Last, like that bird which fan-like spreads her plumes For pride, to Conor's palace she returned, And found him seated in presageful glooms; And spat as though some reptile shape she spurned, ‘Woe, woe; for Deirdré's brightness is gone by;— Brown moth is she that once was butterfly!’ King Conor heard, ill-pleased, and yet well-pleased, And stood, before him dangling still this thought, At least then Naisi of his love is eased; And that proud minx has lost my realm for nought: Perhaps 'twere best to let old rancours pass: Kingdoms live on: but beauty fades like grass. Thus mused the king: but while he sat at meat And, later, when the wine had fired his blood, The thought of Deirdré's face, tender and sweet Too bright to fade, star-like before him stood; And loud he cried: ‘Sits any brave man here Who dreads not death and holds King Conor dear? ‘Forth to the Red Branch Mansion let him speed And there with Deirdré secret converse hold, And learn if yet upon her lives indeed The glory of that beauty hers of old.’ Then Trendorn went, a sordid churl, ill-starred, And found that mansion's gateways closed and barred: Yet clomb he darkling, to that casement high; And Deirdré turned her face:—in awe and fear Of that great splendour o'er it shed, the spy Slid from his place, and racing like a deer To Conor cried: ‘As shines in heaven the sun So she on earth: and like her there is none!’ That instant Conor saw the maid again! That instant rage of love his heart possessed Venomed by past repulse, and jealous pain: And thus he cried, hoarse-voiced with stifling breast, ‘Storm ye the Red Branch House! Die, he that will! Mine was that maid: and mine I deem her still.’ In silence sat the chiefs, mindful at once Of duty sworn to Uladh's king, their Lord, And of his counter-pledge to Usnach's sons; But all the Bonachts ranged adown the board Rushed forth to boast their zeal, and clutch their prey, Aliens base-born that fought not save for pay. To these were joined the vile ones of the street For in their breasts Conor this seed had sown, Imposture sordid and obscene conceit, ‘Traitors in Alba late to princes grown Would make their Pictish tyrant Uladh's king!’— They girt the Red Branch House, thus clamouring. The Red Branch Knights nought answered, sore amazed, Those brave but simple chiefs o'er Erin feared: For Usnach's sons as kings they prized and praised; But like a God King Conor they revered: At last they spake, and after that changed not, ‘We in this war will bear nor part nor lot.’ And when the stony storm blackened the heaven, And gate rolled in, and casement burst and brake, And all that House was as a ship rock-riven In midnight storm, they sat and never spake; For two contrarient thoughts their minds had cleft— Astonied men of manhood's might bereft. Naisi, meantime, and Deirdré, fixed, attent Their eyes in stillness on the ivory board, And silent o'er their game the brothers bent; But Fergus' sons stood up with hand on sword Forth from the casement gazing; and the red Burned on their brows: then Deirdré, careless, said: ‘Long time, methinks, at feast doth Fergus tarry— Good speed for that crowned hawk which hangs on high With beak turned downward toward his skiey quarry!’ Buini broke in: ‘My sire is false; not I!’ And gat him down; and shouted Fergus' name: And straight a host around him flocking came. But Conor sent for Buini, and at door Whispered him low: ‘I yield thee Fo-äd-Fell!’ Yet Buini spurned the bribe, and said, ‘What more?’ And Conor thus: ‘Henceforth mine oracle At council board be thou, and only thou!’ Then Buini pledged with Conor hand and vow. Thenceforth around the Red Branch Mansion higher The madness of the people surged, and roar As though of tempest when great woods catch fire, Or winter waves raking some northern shore; And on the portals seven they dashed; and lo! Their seven huge hinges groaned 'neath blow on blow. Meantime the Red Branch Knights, like men in sleep Trod the vast courts; or like some shepherd boor Who feels his way on cliffs that crest the deep When mist invests the mountain and the moor; Yet certain of Clan Usnach from afar That tempest heard, and rushed into the war. Then Deirdré, as the battle raged below, Spake lightly thus, while on she pushed a pawn, ‘Buini has gone like Fergus—let him go!’ But Illan, grieved at heart, with sword half drawn Replied, ‘While lives this sword, whoe'er may fly Faithful and true to Usnach's Sons am I!’ And gat him down, and drew a host, and drave Southward that seething mass a mile and more, As when the wind before it drives the wave; And shouted, ‘Traitors’ still; and slew six score. Then—sped from heaven—above the heads of all Ran Fear; and reached King Conor's council-hall. There, girt by chiefs sat Conor on his throne With cloudy brows, and pale lips ridged in scorn, Who thus addressed Fiacre, his first-born son: ‘Son, thou and he the self-same hour were born, Illan—the man that from this head even now Sweeps Uladh's crown! Go forth and meet him, thou! ‘And, since the arms he weareth of his sire, Fergus, once king, wear thou mine arms this day, “Ocean,” my shield, that sea-like roars in ire Echoed on Erin's farthest coasts, men say; And “Victory's wing,” and “Flying Fate,” my spears, And “Death,” my sword, annealed in widows' tears.’ Then strode Fiacre to battle, iron-mailed: But straight the king to Conal Carnach sent, ‘My kingdom reels by rebel hosts assailed: My son goes forth to meet them. Sickness-bent I wait the close. My bravest knight, my best! Strike for thy king! What care I for the rest?’ Next to Cuchullain sent he: but that knight Frowned on the herald in his perilous mood, And said, ‘What part have I in civil fight?’ Soon, face to face Fiacre and Illan stood: At last the royal youth, 'neath Illan's sword Sank to one knee: at once in fury roared— Roared, as right well the legends old avouch— ‘Ocean,’ King Conor's shield; for wroth was he A prince's head beneath his shade should crouch, And wroth Emania's coming doom to see— Three times that shield sent forth its sea-like roar; And thrice the three chief waves on Erin's shore Responded, from the blue deeps landward rolling; The wave of Toth on Erin's northern coast; Green Clidna's wave like funeral bells far tolling; And Rory's wave, the loudest. Through the host Rushed Conal Carnach at the third wave's cry, And, shouting thus, ‘King Conor's son will die!’ Dashed in while Illan o'er Fiacre was bending— Illan his friend—and drave through Illan's side, Knowing him not, the sword, his heart-strings rending: But Illan rose, and spake before he died: ‘Thy deeds were great, O friend! This last—this one— Was not like Conal! I am Fergus' son! ‘I die to guard his name and Conor's pledge.’ Then Conal cried in storm of rage and woe, ‘Since Conor lied to me this faulchion's edge Shall pay the debt he owes and that I owe, A debt to honour and to vengeance due;’ And down he dragged Fiacre, and, trampling, slew. That hour the royal host pierced through by grief, Clamoured, yet quailed at glance of Conal's eye; While shouted Illan's band, ‘Be thou our chief! Illan is dead.’ Vouchsafing no reply Silent from both he turned; and, like a God Spurning some death-doomed city, homeward strode. But when the tidings came, ‘Fiacre is dead,’ King Conor dropped in swoon; and if that hour Illan had lived, and not the Ruthless Red, All Eman's chiefs had joined to his their power; For Illan, like his sire, had Eman's love:— Thus Fate round Usnach's Sons her net enwove. Around the Red Branch House that Bonacht host Gathered once more: but on the left the might Of Ardan backward hurled them and their boast; And Ainli's strength rebuked them on the right: Till lit on Conor's heart a wingèd thought; And ‘Fire!’ he cried; and branch and beam were brought Circling the walls: up rushed the red flames roaring; And one by one, the seven great gates fell down; Then rushed from court to court, still onward pouring, Native with alien, man-at-arms with clown: Yet still the assailed fought on from stair to stair, Long time in rage, and later in despair. Meanwhile along the loftier cloister floors As though with fettered feet moved knight with knight, Or, idiot-like, stood peering by the doors, Divided purpose making null their might; Or stood in groups, and watched where, undismayed, That kingly pair at chess in silence played. But Naisi, glancing up, on Deirdré's hair Saw the red reflex from a roof far off, And on her marble cheek the fiery glare, And heard from her fine lip the careless scoff ‘At Conor's fireside welcome sits the guest!’— He rose, and sudden clasped her to his breast; Then held her from him, on her countenance bright Gazing. In neither face that hour was fear: She saw in his a sadness infinite: He saw, in hers, content and princely cheer: At last she spake: ‘Self-questioning thoughts repel, Nor grieve at trust misplaced; for all is well! ‘O Love, not thus upon that causeway old We stood that day, chaunting our nuptials high! Yet nothing is that was not then foretold— Hast thou not happy been? More happy I, That hour thy love; for three glad years thy bride; That ran, and slept, and wakened at thy side! ‘The good must still the auspice be of good; They never loved who dream that Love can die! In lordlier strength, in happier sanctitude Be sure he waits us in some realm more high. All thanks, thou Power Unknown!’ She spake and kissed With all her young bright face her husband's breast. Then rushed to them the Brothers shouting, ‘Forth!’ And forth they sped through courts foot deep in blood, And reached the gate that issued to the north Where fierceliest raged the fight: and Deirdré trod Midmost between the twain, and Naisi first; And on the battle lion-like they burst. And still the Three above their sister raised Their mighty shields that, like three glittering spheres Glared through the gloom, and friend and foeman dazed; And fierce as living creatures worked their spears Dealing black death around, till all the plain Lay like a death-vault, strewn by warriors slain. And, foot by foot, the hostile hosts fell back; And, more and more, true friends, till then dismayed, Fought by their side, or followed in their track: Due northward t'ward the sea their march they made: And, marching, eyed ofttimes that fortress fired— Therein full many a Red Branch Knight expired. Then, as a poplar near a river whitens O'er-blown by gusts, and as some snowy vale Grows grimly dark when sudden o'er it brightens The mountain's moonlit flank, thus dark, thus pale, Grew Conor with far eyes their course pursuing; ‘They 'scape,’ he cried, ‘and that is my undoing! ‘Cathbad! give ear!’—for by him stood that hour The blind old Druid with the silver hair— ‘To Alba make they! thence ere long with power Return in vengeance! Think you they will spare? And Conal and Cuchullain by their side Will march: and Fergus! Would that I had died! ‘Help, Cathbad! last of friends! If e'er from thee Or child or stripling, help or love I gat; My craft has futile proved: my legions flee; Yet magic power, we know, can level flat All power of man in one brief moment's space: Slay me, or spare my kingdom this disgrace!’ To whom replied the old man tremulously: ‘Would God that ne'er had come that night of old When shriek on shriek confused the revelry, And I that new-born Infant's fate foretold; For ne'er in ninety years deceived was I Or by man's art, or wiles of Destiny! ‘Not less, great king, this deed I dare not do, For Justice keeps an axe, and keen its edge In worlds unseen; and they their sin shall rue Who spill the righteous blood, or break the pledge. Here Wrong holds court; but Justice reigneth there: King! In those unseen regions I have share!’ Him Conor answered: ‘Cathbad! oath I make By all those regions sacred and unseen, By all the Powers that in them sleep or wake, The Gods that are, or shall be, or have been, This hand on Usnach's sons shall work no wrong; Captive, not dead, I wish them—nor for long.’ He spake, and softly to the Druid stept And pressed that Druid's hand to lips and eyes; Then o'er the old man's heart compassion crept With flattered pride which oft to good and wise Makes way, thus veiled, in weak unwary hour; And o'er the North he waved his wand of power. Three times with muttered spell he waved that wand, Filling the air with visions of dismay: That hour through Conor's host, and far beyond, Usnach's brave clan had carved its desperate way Hourly in numbers waxing; in their rear That Bonacht swarm. It raged, but came not near. Upon that clan the Druid's spells took hold, Feigning what was not: and the wide green plain Seemed to their eyes a great flood slowly rolled From phantom hills. Through it they pushed with pain: And on their eyes a phantom mist was driven: And o'er them leaned, low-hung, a phantom heaven. But, forward as they toiled, that flood ere long Deepened, so seemed it, to a billowy sea; And they, with arms in swimmer's act forth flung, Clave that imagined deep. Alone the Three And Deirdré, spite of spells illusion-proof, Saw still green field, and heaven's unclouded roof. Ah God! How oft in agony that hour Caught they this man and that, and cried, ‘Arise! But now triumphant, will ye crouch and cower In death the coward's jest, the traitor's prize?’ 'Twas vain! Those dreamers still swam on till brand And shield down dropt from every helpless hand. The Bonachts stood in marvel; then dashed on, Their terror past; and Conor sent decree ‘Except the woman see ye spare not one! Smite first the sons of Usnach, smite the Three!’ And lo! like sheep that old and far-famed clan Lay on the war-field slaughtered to a man. Alone, girt round by hostile rank on rank, Usnach's great sons, unvanquished, still fought on: And ever when their arms exhausted sank And for a moment strength was all but gone, Deirdré, amidst them, like a prophet poured Her war-songs forth, and still that strength restored. 'Twas vain! At noon the dire death-battle ceased: That glorious Three who late the world o'er-strode Lay facing to the South, and West, and East; A frozen spectre Deirdré o'er them stood: The Bonachts gat their hire: kneeling drew near Uladh's sad sons with many a moan and tear. Remembering days gone by, the victors there Wept for the dead: and when the king sent word To leave those Three unburied, stark and bare For beasts to rend, his mandate they abhorred, And dug the grave where those brave Brothers died; And, reverent, therein laid them, side by side. Upon the right of that dim burial pit Was Conal Carnach standing; on its left Cuchullain; each with brows in sorrow knit, Each with a heart by one sharp memory cleft: For true to Usnach's sons in word and deed These twain had lived; yet failed them at their need. But Deirdré at the grave-head stood alone, The surging crowd held back by holy dread; Her face was white as monumental stone; Her hands, her garb, from throat to foot were red With blood—their blood. Standing on life's dark verge She scorned to die till she had sung their dirge. ‘Dead are the eagles three of Culan's peaks; The lions three of Uladh's forest glades; The wonders three of Alba's lakes and creeks; The loved ones three of Etive's fair young maids: The crownless sons of Erin's throne are sped: The glories of the Red Branch Order dead. ‘Is there who dreams that, now my Naisi's breath Is stilled, his wife will tarry from his side? Thou man that dig'st far down yon cave of death Be sure thou dig it deep, and dig it wide! There lie the Brothers Three! 'Tis just, 'tis meet Their Sister take her place before their feet. ‘Ofttimes for me they piled their shields and spears In Alba's woods, roofing my winter bed: Thou man that build'st, this day, far down their biers Be sure the spear and shield are nigh the head! They had great joy in these of old: below Lack them they shall not, though they meet no foe. ‘Ofttimes I heard in Etive's hunting grounds Their deep-toned voices rolling like the sea— My Naisi led me from our native bounds: Ainli and Ardan followed. Woe is me! That hour when I was born I should have died: The ill-omened Infant was the ill-omened Bride!’ Thus Deirdré sang, and silent stood a space; Then spake once more: ‘I come, my Love, my Lord!’ And forward fell into that loved embrace, In happy death to him she loved restored: When Conal and Cuchullain raised her head, There lay she smiling, dead among the dead. The men of Erin reared the funeral stone And piled the cairn, in Ogham characters Cyphering the sorrows of the Four thereon: And, age by age, that legend grey avers, Sad voices issuing from that grave foretold The fates of lovers young and kingdoms old. But Cathbad laid a curse upon the king, Likewise his race: and Eman, and the land, Because they hated not that evil thing, And hindered not, with dreadful rites he banned; And lastly, ‘Woe to me not less,’ he cried, Three times; and gat him to his place; and died. With speed came up at earliest gleam of morn Fergus to Eman. Dreadful his array; For many a chief, though Conor's liegeman sworn, In wrath had joined the old king on his way: And Fergus cursed the Ruthless Red, and said, ‘A woman's hand one day shall strike him dead!’ The battle ceased not till that day was done: With his own hand at noontide Fergus slew Maini, King Conor's best belovèd son: Old Eman's walls and towers to earth he threw And burned the city. Half the men therein Perished, and many an infant, for its sin. THE CHILDREN OF LIR. AN ANCIENT IRISH ROMANCE. ‘Deus dedit carmina in nocte’—Job, cap. xxxv. v. 10. TO THE MEMORY OF DENIS FLORENCE MAC-CARTHY, TO WHOM ENGLISH AND IRISH READERS OWE, BESIDE MANY A GAELIC LEGEND, THE BEST WORKS OF CALDERON, THIS POEM IS DEDICATED. CANTO I. THE STEPMOTHER'S MALEDICTION. Ere yet great Miledh's sons to Erin came, Lords of the Gael, Milesian styled more late, An earlier tribe, Tuatha was their name, Likewise Dedannan, ruled the Isle of Fate, A tribe that knew nor clan, nor priest, nor bard, Wild as the waves, and as the sea-cliffs hard. Some say that race of old from Greece exiled Long time had sojourned in the frozen North Roaming Norwegian wood and Danish wild: To Erin thence more late they issued forth, And thither brought two gifts both loved and feared, The Lia Fail, and Ogham lore revered. Fiercer they were, not manlier, than the Gael, Large-handed, swift of foot, dark-haired, dark-eyed, With sudden gleams athwart their faces pale, Transits of fancies swift, or angry pride: Strange lore they boasted, imped by insight keen; Blackened at times by gusts of causeless spleen. These, when the white fleet of the Gael drew nigh Green Erin's shore, their heritage decreed, O'er-meshed through rites unholy earth and sky With sudden gloom. The invaders took no heed But dashed through dark their galleys on the strand; Then clapped their hands, and laughing leaped to land. Around them drew Tuatha's race in guile, Unarmed, with mocking voice and furtive mien, And scoffed: ‘Not thus your fathers fought erewhile! Say, call ye warriors knaves that creep unseen, While true men sleep, up inlet dim and fiord, Filching the land they proved not with their sword?’ Then to the Gael their bard, Amergin, spake: ‘Sail forth, my sons, nine waves across the deep, And when this island-race are armed, come back; Take then their realm by force; and, taking, keep!’ The Gael sailed forth, nine waves; then turned and gazed— Night wrapt the isle, and storm by magic raised! Round Erin's shores like leaves their ships were blown: Strewn on her reefs lay bard and warrior drowned; Not less the Gael upreared ere long that throne Two thousand years through all the West renowned. O'er Taillten's field God held the scales of Fate: That last dread battle closed the dire debate. There fell those three Tuatha queens who gave The land their names—they fell by death discrowned: Bamba, Fodhla, and Eire. There many a Gaelic chieftain found his grave: Thenceforth the races twain adjusted bound And right, at times by league, at times by war; Nor any reigned as yet from shore to shore. Still here and there Tuatha princes ruled Now in green vale, and now on pale blue coast, Huge warrior one, and one in magic schooled; The graver made Druidic lore their boast, And knew the secret might of star and leaf: Grey-haired King Bove stood up of these the chief. Southward by broad Lough Derg his palace stood: Northward, beside Emania's lonely mere In Finnahá, embowered 'mid lawn and wood, King Lir abode, a warrior, not a seer; Well loved was he, plain man with great, true heart, Who loathed, despite his race, the sorcerer's art. Five centuries lived he ere that better light Gladdened the earth from Bethlehem: ne'ertheless He judged his land with justice and with might, Tempering the same at times with gentleness; And gave the poor their due; and made proclaim, ‘Let no man smite the old; the virgin shame.’ His prime was spent in wars: in middle life He bade a youthful princess share his throne: Nor e'er had monarch yet a truer wife With tenderer palm or voice of sweeter tone, The one sole lady of that race was she Sun-haired, with large eyes azure as the sea. She moved amid the crafty as a child; Amid the lawless, chaste as unsunned maid; Amid the unsparing, as a turtle mild; Wondering at wrong; too gentle to upbraid: Yet many a fell resolve, as she rode by, Died at its birth—the ill-thinker knew not why! Sadness before her fled: in years long past As on a cliff the warriors sang their songs A harper maid with eyes that stared aghast Had chaunted, ‘Not to us this isle belongs! The Fates reserve it for a race more true Ye children of Dedannan's stock, than you!’ And since she scorned her music to abate Nor ceased to freeze their triumph with her dirge The princes and the people rose in hate And hurled her harp and her into the surge: Yea still halfway 'twixt midnight and the morn That dirge swelled up, by tempest onward borne! Remembering oft this spectre of his youth King Lir would sit, a frown upon his brow: Then came the queen with words of peace and truth; ‘Mourn they that sinned! A child that hour wert thou! Thou rul'st this land to-day: in years to be Who best deserves shall wield her sovereignty.’ Then would the monarch doff his sullen mood With kingly joy, and, bright as May-day's morn, Ride forth amid his hounds through wild and wood, Thrilling far glens with echoes of his horn; Or meet the land's invaders face to face Well pleased, and homeward hew them with disgrace. Thus happy lived the pair, and happier far When four fair children graced the royal house, Fairer than flowers, more bright than moon or star Shining through vista long of forest boughs. Finola was the eldest, eight years old: The yearling, Conn, best loved of all that fold. These beauteous creatures with their mother shared Alike her blissful nature and sweet looks, Like her swan-soft, swan-white, blue-eyed, bright-haired, With voices musical as birds or brooks: Beings they seemed reserved for some great fate, Mysterious, high, elect, and separate. At times they gambolled in the sunny sheen; At times, Fiacre and Aodh at her side, Finola paced the high-arched alleys green At once their youthful playmate and their guide: A mother-hearted child she walked, and pressed That infant, daily heavier, to her breast. Great power of Love that, wide as heaven, dost brood O'er all the earth, and doest all things well! Light of the wise, and safeguard of the good! Nowhere, methinks, thou better lov'st to dwell Than in the hearts of innocents that still, By dangerous love untempted, work Love's will! Thou shalt be with them when the sleet-wind blows Not less than in the violet-braided bower: Through thee 'mid desert sands shall bud the rose, The wild wave anthems sing! In trial's hour A germ of thine shall breed that quenchless Faith Amaranth of life, and asphodel of death. Ah lot of man! Ah world whose life is change! Ah sheer descent from topmost height of good To deepest gulf of anguish sudden and strange! A nation round their monarch's gateway stood: All day there stood they, whispering in great dread: The herald came at last—‘Our Queen is dead!’ In silence still they stood an hour and more, Till through the West had sunk the great red sun, And from the castle wall and turrets hoar The latest crimson utterly had gone: At last the truth had reached them; then on high An orphaned People hurled its funeral cry. They hurled it forth again and yet again, The dreadful wont of that barbaric time Cry after cry that reached the far-off main And, echoing, seemed from cloud to cloud to climb; Then lifted hands like creatures broken-hearted, Or sentenced men; and homeward, mute, departed. Fast-speeding Time, albeit the wounded wing He may not bind, brings us at least the crutch: Winter was over, and the on-flying Spring Grazed the sad monarch's brow with heavenly touch And raised the head, now whitening, from the ground And stanched, not healed, the heart's eternal wound. King Bove, the Pontiff king of that dark race, To Lir sent missives, ‘Quit thee like a man! The Gaels, our scourge, and Erin's sore disgrace, Advance, each day, their armies, clan by clan; Against them march thy host with mine, and take To wife my daughter, for thy children's sake.’ Lir sadly mused; but answered: ‘Let it be!’ And drave with fifty chariots in array To where the land's chief river like a sea There named Lough Derg, spreads out in gulf and bay And many a woody mountain sees its face Imaged in that clear flood with softened grace. There with King Bove the widowed man abode Two days amid great feastings. On the third The king led forth his daughter—o'er her glowed A dim veil jewel-tissued—with this word: ‘Behold thy wife! The world proclaims her fair: I know her strong to love, and strong to dare.’ And Lir made answer: ‘Fair she is as when A mist-veiled yew, red-berried, stands in state: Can love, you say! Love she my babes! and then With her my love shall bide; if not—my hate.’ And she, a crimson on her dusky brow, Replied, ‘If so it be, then be it so!’ King Lir, a fortnight more in revels spent, Made journey to his castle in the North With her, his youthful consort, well content: Arrived, in rapture of their loving mirth Forth rushed into his arms his children four Bright as those wavelets on their blue lake's shore; On whom the new queen cast a glance oblique One moment's space; then, flinging wide her arms, With instinct changed and impulse lightning-like Clasped them in turn and wondered at their charms And cried, ‘If e'er a stepmother could love I of that tribe renowned will tenderest prove.’ And so by her great loving of those four Still from her husband won she praises sweet And plaudits from his people more and more; Her own she called them: nor was this deceit: She loved them with a fitful love—a will To make them or to mar, for good or ill. She wooed them still with shows, with flowers, with fruit; Daily for them new sports she sought and found: Yet, if their father praised them she was mute And, when he placed them on his knee, she frowned, Murmuring, ‘How blue their eyes! their cheek how pale! Their voices too are voices of the Gael!’ Meantime, as month by month in grace they grew, Their father loved them better than before; And so, one eve, their slender cots he drew Each from its place remote, and lightly bore, And laid them ranged before his royal bed; And o'er the four a veil gold-woven spread; Their mother's bridal-veil: and still as dawn Was in its glittering tissue caged and caught He left his couch, and, that light veil withdrawn, Before his children stood in silent thought; And, if they slept, he kissed them in their sleep, Then watched them with clasped hands in musings deep. And, if they slept not, from their balmy nest With under-sliding arms he raised them high, And clasped them each, successive, to his breast, Or on them flashed the first light from the sky: Then laid him by his mute, sleep-feigning bride, And slept once more: and oft in sleep he sighed. Which things abhorring, she her face averse Turned all day steadfast from the astonished throng: And next, as one that broods upon a curse, She sat in her sick-chamber three weeks long, And never raised her eyes, nor made complaint, Dark as a fiend and silent as a saint. Lastly to Lir she spake: ‘Daily I sink Downward to death. I wither in my prime: Home to my father I would speed, and drink Once more the breezes of my native clime: All night in sleep along Lough Derg I strayed, And wings of strength about my shoulders played. ‘These four—thy children—with me I will take To please my father's eye; he loves them well: Thou too, whene'er thy leisure serves, shalt make Thither thy journey.’ All the powers of Hell Thrilled at that speech in penal vaults below; But Lir, no fraud suspecting, answered, ‘Go!’ Therefore next morn when earliest sunrise smote Green mead to golden near the full-fed stream, They caught four steeds that grazed thereby remote And yoked abreast beside the chariot beam; And when the sun was sinking toward the West By Darvra's lake drew rein, and made their rest. There the bad queen, descending, round her cast A baleful look of mingled hate and woe, And with those babes into a thicket passed, And drew a dagger from her breast; and lo! She struck them not, but only wailed and wailed— So strongly in her womanhood prevailed. The mood was changed. She smiled that smile which none How wise soe'er, beholding, could resist And drew those children to her, one by one; Then wailed once more, and last their foreheads kissed And cried with finger pointing to the lake, ‘Hence! and in that clear bath your pastime take!’ She spoke, and from their silken garb forth-sliding Ere long those babes were sporting in the bay; And, as it chanced, the eddy past them gliding Wafted a swan's plume: 'twas less white than they: Frowning, the queen beheld them, and on high Waved thrice her Druid wand athwart the sky: Then, standing on the marge wan-cheeked, wideeyed, As near they drew, awe-struck and wondering, Therewith she smote their golden heads, and cried, ‘Fly hence, ye pale-faced children of the king! Cleave the blue mere, or on through ether sail; No more his loved ones but a dolorous tale!’ Straightway to snow-white swans those children turned: And, sideway as they swerved, the creatures four Fixed on her looks with human grief that yearned; Then slowly drifted backward from the shore; While loud with voice unchanged, Finola cried, ‘Bad deed is thine, false queen and bitter bride! ‘Bad deed afflicting babes that harmed thee not; Bad deed, and to thyself an evil dower: Disastrous more than ours shall be thy lot! Thou too shalt feel the weight of Druid power: From age to age thy penance ne'er shall cease: Our doom, though long it lasts, shall end in peace.’ Then rang a wild shriek from that dreadful shape: ‘Long, long, ay long shall last those years of woe! Here on this lake from misty cape to cape Three centuries ye shall wander to and fro; Three centuries more shall stem with heavier toil Far Alba's waves, the black sea-strait The current running between Cantire, in Scotland, and the northern coast of Ireland. of Moyle. ‘Lastly three centuries where the Eagle-Crest Achill Island, on the coast of Connaught. O'er-looks the western deep and Inisglaire Upon the mountain waves that know not rest Shall be your rolling palace, foul or fair, Till comes the Tailkenn, The ‘Tonsured One,’ i.e. St. Patrick. sent to sound the knell Of darkness, and you hear his Christian bell.’ Lo, as a band of lilies white and tall Beneath a breeze of morning bend their head High held in virgin state majestical So meekly cowered those swans in holy dread Hearing that promised Tailkenn's blissful name: For they long since had heard in dream the same. Then fell a dew of meekness on the proud Noting their humble heart; and dropped her front; And sorrow closed around her like a cloud; And thus with other voice than was her wont To those soft victims of her wrath she cried: ‘Woe, woe! Yet Fate must rule, whate'er betide! ‘The deed is done; but thus much I concede: In you the human heart shall never fail Changed though you be and masked in feathery weed: Your voice shall sweet remain as voice of Gael; And all who hear your songs shall sink in trance And sleeping dream some great deliverance.’ She spake, and smote her hands; and at her word O'er-awed and mute men caught the royal steeds Grazing in peace beside the hornèd herd Amid the meadow flowers and yellow weeds: And breathed her spirit into those steeds and drave And reached Lough Derg what time above its wave The sun was rising; and at set of sun Entered once more her father's palace gate: Seated thereby his nobles, every one, Arose and welcomed her with loving state: She answered naught, but sternly past them strode And found her girlhood's bower, and there abode. But when of Lir King Bove had made demand, She answered thus: ‘Enough! My Lord is naught; Nor will he trust his children to thy hand Lest thou shouldst slay them.’ Long in silent thought The old man stood, then murmured in low tone ‘I loved those children better than mine own!’ That night in dream King Lir had anguish sore, And southward ere the dawn rode far away With many a chief to see his babes once more Beside Lough Derg; and lo, at close of day Nighing to Darvra's lake, the westering sun In splendour on the advancing horsemen shone. Straightway from that broad water's central stream Was heard a clang of pinions and swift feet— Unchanged at heart those babes had caught that gleam, Instant from far had rushed, their sire to greet Spangling the flood with silver spray; and ere That sire had reached the margin they were there. Then, each and all, clamorous they made lament Recounting all their wrong and all the woe And Lir, their tale complete, his garments rent, Till then transfixed like marble shape; and lo! Three times, heart-grieved, his warriors raised their cry Piercing the centre of the low-hung sky. But Lir knelt down upon the shining sand And cried, ‘Though great the might of Druid charms, Return and feel once more your native land, And find once more and fill your father's arms!’ And they made answer: ‘Till the Tailkenn come We tread not land! The waters are our home.’ But when Finola saw her father's grief She added thus; ‘Albeit our days are sad The twilight brings our pain in part relief: And songs are ours by night that make us glad: Yea, each that hears our music though he grieve Rejoices more. Abide, for it is eve.’ So Lir, and his, couched on the wave-lipped sod All night; and ever as those songs up swelled A mist of sleep upon them fell from God And healing Spirits converse with them held: And Lir was glad all night: but with the morn Anguish returned; and thus he cried, forlorn: ‘Farewell! The morn is come; and I depart: Farewell! Not wholly evil are things ill! Farewell, Finola! Yea, but in my heart With thee I bide: there liv'st thou changeless still: O Aodh! O Fiacre! the night is gone:— Farewell to both! Farewell, my little Conn.’ Southward with speed the childless rode once more And saw at last beyond the forests tall The great lake and the palace on its shore; And, entering, onward passed from hall to hall To where King Bove majestic sat and crowned High on a terrace with his seers around, A stately terrace clustered round with towers, And jubilant with music's merry din, Beaten by resonant waves, and bright with flowers: There—but apart—she stood that wrought the sin, Like one that broods on one black thought alone Seen o'er a world of happy hopes o'erthrown. The throng made way: onward the wronged one strode To Bove, sole-throned and lifting in his hand For royal sceptre that Druidic rod Which gave him o'er the Spirit-world command; Then, pointing to that traitress, false as fair, The childless spake: ‘There stands the murderess!—there!’ Straight on the King Druidic insight fell; And, mirrored in his mind as cloud in lake, His daughter's crime distinct and visible, Before him stood. He turned to her and spake: ‘Thou hear'st the charge: how makest thou reply?’ And she: ‘The deed is mine! I wrought it! I!’ Then spake King Bove with countenance like night: ‘Of all dread shapes that traverse earth or sea, Or pierce the soil, or urge through heaven their flight, Say, which abhorrest thou most?’ And answered she: ‘The shape of Spirits Accursed that ride the storm:’ And he: ‘Be thine henceforth that demon form!’ He spake, and lifted high his Druid Wand:— T'ward him perforce she drew: she bowed her head: Down on that head he dropp'd it; and beyond The glooming lake, with bat-like wings outspread O'er earth's black verge the shrieking Fury passed; Thenceforth to circle earth while earth shall last. As when, on autumn eve from hill or cape That slants into grey wastes of western sea, The sun long set, some shepherd stares agape At cloud that seems through endless space to flee On raven pinions down the moaning wind, Thus on that Fury stared they, well-nigh blind. Then spake the Pontiff-king with head that shook, ‘I loved thy babes: now therefore let us go Northward, and on their blameless beauty look, Though changed, and hear their songs: for this I know By Druid art, they sing the whole night long And heaven and earth are solaced by their song.’ Northward ere dawn they rode with a great host; And loosed their steeds by Darvra's mirror clear What time purpureal evening like a ghost Stepped from the blue glen on the glimmering mere: And camped where stood the ruminating herds With heads forth leaning t'ward those human birds. And, ever o'er the wave those swans would come To hear man's voice, and tell their tale to each, Swift as the wind and whiter than the foam; Yet never mounted they the bowery beach, And still swerved backward from the beckoning hand Revering thus their stepmother's command. And ever, when the sacred night descended While with those ripples on the sandy bars The sighing woods and winds low murmurs blended Their music fell upon them from the stars, And they gave utterance to that gift divine In silver song or anthem crystalline. Who heard that strain no more his woes lamented: The exiled chief forgat his place of pride: The prince ill-crowned his ruthless deed repented: The childless mother and the widowed bride Amid their locks tear-wet and loosely straying Felt once again remembered touches playing. The words of that high music no one knew; Yet all men felt there lived a meaning there Immortal, marvellous, searching, strengthening, true, The pledge of some great future strange and fair When sin shall lose her might, and cleansing woe Shall on the Just some starry crown bestow. Lulled by that strain the prophet king let drop In death his Druid-Staff by Darvra's side: And there in later years with happy hope King Lir, that mystic requiem listening, died: And there those blissful sufferers bore their wrong All day in weeping, and all night in song. Not once 'tis whispered in that mystic story They raised their voice God's justice to arraign: All patient suffering is expiatory: Their doom was linked with hope of Erin's gain; And, like the Holy Elders famed of old, Those babes on that high Promise kept their hold. And they saw great towers built, and saw them fall; And saw the little seedling tempest-sown; And generations under torch and pall Brone forth to narrow graves ere long grass-grown; And all these things to them were as a dream, Or shade that sleeps on some fast hurrying stream. More numerous daily flocked to that still shore Peace-loving spirits: yea, the Gaelic clans And tribes Dedannan, foemen there no more, From the same fountains brimmed their flowing cans, And washed their kirtles in the same pure rills, And brought their corn-sheaves to the self-same mills. Thus, though elsewhere the sons of Erin strove From Aileach's coast and Uladh's marble cliffs To where by Lee, and Beara's inmost cove, The fishers spread their nets and launched their skiffs Round Darvra's shores remained inviolate peace; There too the flocks and fields had best increase. In that long strife the Gael the victory won: Tuatha's race Dedannan disappeared; Yet still the conqueror whispered, sire to son, ‘Their progeny survives, half scorned, half feared, The Fairy Host; and mansions bright they hold On moonlight hills and under waters cold. ‘To snare the Gael perpetual spells they weave: O'er the wet waste they bid the meteor glide: They raise illusive cliffs at morn and eve On wintry coasts: sea-mantled rocks they hide: And shipwrecked sailors eye them o'er the waves, Dark shapes pygmean couchant in sea-caves. ‘Some say that, 'tween the mountains’ sunless walls They throng beneath their stony firmament, An iron-handed race. At intervals Through chasm stream-cloven, and through rocky rent The shepherd hears their multitudinous hum As of far hosts approaching swift yet dumb. ‘In those dread vaults, Magian and Alchemist Supreme in every craft of brain and hand, The mountains' mineral veins they beat and twist; And on red anvils forge them spear and brand For some predestined battle. Yea, men say The island shall be theirs that last great day!’ CANTO II. THE PENANCE OF THE INNOCENTS. What time, forth sliding from the Eternal Gates, The centuries three on earth had lived and died, Thus spake Finola to her snowy mates, ‘No more in this soft haven may we bide: The second Woe succeeds: that heavier toil On Alba's waves, the black sea-strait of Moyle.’ Then wept to her in turn the younger Three: ‘Alas the sharp rocks and the salt sea-foam! Thou therefore make the lay ere yet we flee From this our exile's cradle sweet as home!’ And thus Finola sang while, far and near, The men of Erin wept that strain to hear: ‘Farewell, Lough Darvra, with thine isles of bloom! Farewell, familiar tribes that grace our shore! The penance deepens on us and the doom: Farewell! The voice of man we list no more Till he, the Tailkenn, comes to sound the knell Of darkness, and rings out his gladsome bell.’ Thus singing, 'mid their dirge the sentenced soared Heaven-high; then hanging mute on plumes outspread, With downcast eye long time that lake explored; And lastly with a great cry northward sped: Then was it Erin's sons, listening that cry, Decreed: ‘The man who slays a swan shall die.’ Three days against the northern blast on-flying To Fate obedient and the Will Divine, They reached, what time the crimson eve was lying On Alba's isles and ocean's utmost line, That huge sea-strait whose racing eddies boil 'Twixt Erin and that cloud-girt headland Moyle. ‘The term Mael, Mull (or Moyle, as Moore calls it), does not properly apply to the current itself, but to the Mael, or bald headland by which it runs.’—Professor Eugene O'Curry. There anguish fell on them: they heard the booming Of league-long breakers white, and gazed on waves Wreck-strewn, themselves entombed and all-entombing, Rolling to labyrinths dim of red-roofed caves; And streaming waters broad as with one will In cataracts from grey shelves descending still. There, day by day, the sun more early set; And through the hollows of the high-ridged sea Which foamed around their rocky cabinet The whirlwinds lashed them more remorselessly: And winter followed soon: and ofttimes storms Shrouded for weeks the mountains' frowning forms. In time all ocean omens they had learned; And once, as o'er the darkening deep they roved, Finola, who the advancing woe discerned, Addressed them: ‘Little brothers well beloved, Though many a storm hath tried us, yet the worst Comes up this night: now therefore, ere it burst ‘Devise we swiftly if, through God's high Will, Billow or blast divides us each from each, Some refuge-house wherein, when winds are still, To meet once more—low rock or sandy beach:’ And answer thus they made: ‘One spot alone This night can yield us refuge, Carickrone.’ They spake, and sudden thunder shook the world And blackness wrapped the seas and lightnings rent; And each from each abroad those swans were hurled By solid water-scud. Outworn and spent At last, that direful tempest over-blown, Finola scaled their trysting-rock—alone. But when she found no gentle brother near, And heard the great storm roaring far away, Anguish of anguish pierced her heart, and fear, And thus she made her moan and sang her lay: ‘Death-cold they lie along the far sea-tide: Would that as cold I drifted at their side!’ Thus as she sang, behold, the sun uprose, And smote a swan that on a wave's smooth crest Exhausted lay, like one by pitiless foes Trampled, and looking but to death for rest: At last he clomb that rock, though weak and worn, With bleeding feet and pinions tempest-torn. Aodh was he! He couched him by her side; Straight her right wing Finola o'er him spread: Ere long nearing the rock Fiacre she spied, Wounded yet more; yet soon he hid his head 'Neath her left wing, her nestling's wonted place, And slept content in that beloved embrace. But still Finola mused with many a tear, ‘Alas for us, of little Conn bereft!’ Then Conn came floating by, full blithe of cheer, For he, secure within a craggy cleft, Had slept all night; and now once more his nest He made of right beneath his sister's breast. And as they slept she sang: ‘Among the flowers Of old we played where princes quaffed their wine; But now for flowery fields sea-floods are ours; And now our wine-cup is the bitter brine; Yet, brothers, fear no ill; for God will send At last His Tailkenn, and our woes find end.’ Then God, Who of least things has tenderest thought, Looked down on them benignly from on high And bade that bitter brine to enter not Their scars, unhealed as yet, lest they should die; And nearer sent their choicest food full oft, And clothed their wings with plumage fine and soft. And ever as the spring advanced, the sea Put on its kindlier aspect. Cliffs deep-scarred To milder airs gave welcome festively Upon their iron breasts and foreheads hard, And, while about their feet the ripples played, Cast o'er the glaring deep a friendlier shade. And when at last the full midsummer panted Upon the austere main, and high-peaked isles, And hills that, like some elfin land enchanted, Now charmed, now mocked the eye with phantom smiles, More far round Alba's shores the swans made way To Islay's beach and cloud-loved Colonsay. The growths beside their native lake oft noted In that sublimer clime no more they missed; Jewels, not flowers they found where'er they floated Emerald and sapphire, opal, amethyst, Far-kenned through watery depths or magic air, Or trails of broken rainbows, here and there. Round Erin's northern coasts they drifted on From Rathlin isle to Fanad's beetling crest, And where, in frowning sunset steeped, forth shone The ‘Bloody Foreland’ gazing t'ward the west; Yet still with duteous hearts to Moyle returned— To love their place of penance they had learned. One time it chanced that, onward as they drifted Where Banna's onward torrent cuts the sea, A princely company with banners lifted Rode past on snow-white steeds and sang for glee: At once they knew those horsemen, form and face, Their native stock, Tuatha's ancient race! T'ward them they sped: their sorrows they recounted: The warriors could not aid them, and rode by: Then higher than of old their anguish mounted; And farther rang through heaven their piteous cry; And when it ceased, this lay Finola sang While all the echoing rocks and caverns rang: ‘Whilom in purple clad we sat elate: The warriors watched us at their nut-brown mead: But now we roam the waters desolate Or breast the languid beds of waving weed: Our food was then fine bread; our drink was wine; This day on sea-plants sour we peak and pine. ‘Whilom, our four small cots of pearl and gold Lay, side by side, before our father's bed And silken foldings kept us from the cold: But now on restless waves our couch is spread; And now our bed-clothes are the white sea-foam: And now by night the sea-rock is our home.’ Not less from them such sorrows swiftly passed Since evermore one thought their bosoms filled— Their father's home. That haunt, in memory glassed, Childhood perpetual o'er their lives distilled: And, coast what shore they might, green vale and plain Bred whiter flocks, men said, more golden grain. The years ran on: the centuries three went by: Finola sang: ‘The second Woe is ended!’ Obedient then, once more they soared on high; Next morn on Erin's western coast descended, While sunrise flashed from misty isles far seen, Now gold, now flecked with streaks of luminous green. And there for many a winter they abode, Harbouring in precincts of the setting sun; And mourned by day, yet sang at night their ode As though in praise of some great victory won, Some conqueror more than man; some heavenly crown Slowly o'er all creation settling down. There once—what time a great sun in decline Had changed to red the grey back of a wave That showered a pasture fair with diamond brine, Then sank, anon uprising from its grave Went shouldering onward, higher and more high, And hid far lands, and half eclipsed the sky— There once a shepherd, Aibhric, high of race, Marked them far off, and marking them so loved That to the ocean's verge he rushed apace With hands outspread. Shoreward the creatures moved: And when he heard them speak with human tongue That love he felt grew tenderer and more strong. Day after day they told that youth their tale: Wide-eyed he stood, and inly drank their words; And later, harping still in wood and vale, He fitted oft their sorrow to his chords; And thus to him in part men owe the lore ‘They met a young man of good family whose name was Aibhric, and his attention was often attracted to the birds, and their singing was sweet to him, so that he came to love them greatly, and that they loved him; and it was this young man that afterwards arranged in order and narrated all their adventures.’—The Fate of the Children of Lir, prose version, by Professor O'Curry. Of all those patient sufferers bare of yore. For bard he was; and still the bard-like nature Hath reverence, as for virtue, so for woe, And ever finds in trials of the creature The great Creator's purpose here below To lift by lowering, and through anguish strange To fit for thrones exempt from chance or change. There first the Four had met that sympathy Dearest to humblest heart. That treasure found So much the more ere long calamity Tasked them, thus strengthened; tasked and closed them round; And higher yet fierce winds and watery shocks Dashed them thenceforth upon more pitiless rocks. At last from heaven's dark vault a night there fell The direst they had known. The high-heaped seas Vanquished by frost, beneath her iron spell Abased their haughty crests by slow degrees: The swans were frozen upon that ice-plain frore; Yet still Finola sang, as oft before, ‘Beneath my right wing, Aodh, make thy rest! Beneath my left, Fiacre! My little Conn, Find thou a warmer shelter 'neath my breast, As thou art wont: thou art my little son! Thou God that all things mad'st, and lovest all, Subdue things great! Protect the weak, the small!’ But evermore the younger three made moan; And still their moans more loud and louder grew; And still Finola o'er that sea of stone For their sake fragments of wild wailings threw; And ever as she sang the on-driving snow Choked the sweet strain; yet still she warbled low: Then, louder when she heard those others grieve And found that song might now no more avail She said: ‘Believe, O brothers young, believe In that great God whose help can never fail! Have faith in God since God can ne'er deceive!’ And lo, those weepers answered, ‘We believe!’ So thus those babes, in God's predestined hour, Through help of Him, the Lord of Life and Death Inly fulfilled with light and prophet power Believed, and perfect made their Act of Faith; And thenceforth all things, both in shade and shine, To them came softly and with touch benign. First, from the southern stars there came a breeze On-wafting happy mist of moonlit rain; And when the sun ascended o'er the seas The ice was vanquished; and the watery plain And every cloud with rapture thrilled and stirred: And lo, at noon the cuckoo's voice was heard. And since with that rough ice their feet were sore God for their sake a wind from Eden sent That gently raised them from the ocean's floor And in its bosom as an ambient tent Held them, suspense: and with a dew of balm God, while they slept, made air and ocean calm. Likewise a beam auroral forth He sped That flushed that tent aerial like a rose Each morn, and roseate odours o'er it shed The long day through. And still at evening's close They dreamed of those rich bowers and alleys green Wherein with Lir their childish sports had been. And thrice they dreamed that in the morning grey They gathered there red roses drenched with dew: But lo! a serpent 'neath the roses lay: Then came the Tailkenn, and that serpent slew; And round the Tailkenn's tonsured head was light That made the morning more than noonday bright. Thus wrapt, thus kindled, in sublimer mood Heaven-high they soared and flung abroad their strain O'er-sailing huge Croagh-Patrick swathed in wood Or Acaill, Now Achill Head. warder of the western main, Or Arran Isle, that time heroic haunt, Since Enda's day Religion's saintlier vaunt. And many a time they floated farther south Where milder airs endear sea-margins bleak To that dim Head far seen o'er Shenan's mouth Or Smerwick's ill-famed cliff and winding creek, Or where on Brandon sleeps Milesius' son With all his shipwrecked warriors round him—Donn. The centuries passed: her loud, exultant lay Finola sang, their time of penance done, And ended: ‘Lo, to us it seems a day; Not less the dread Nine Hundred Years are run: Now, brothers, homeward be our flight!’. And they Chanted triumphant: ‘Home, to Finnahá!’ Up from the sea they rose in widening gyre, And hung suspended 'mid the ethereal blue, And saw, far flashing in the sunset's fire A wood-girt lake whose splendour well they knew; And flew all night; and reached at dawn its shore— Ah, then rang out that wail ne'er heard before! There where the towers of Lir of old had stood Lay now the stony heap and rain-washed rath; And through the ruin-mantling alder-wood The forest beast had stamped in mire his path; And desolate were their mother's happy bowers So fair of old with fountains and with flowers! More closely drew the orphans each to each:— 'Twas then Finola raised her dirge on high As nearer yet they drifted to the beach In hope one fragment of past days to spy; ‘Upon our father's house hath fallen a change; And as a dead man's face this place is strange! ‘No more the hound and horse; no more the horn! No more the warriors winding down the glen! Behold, the place of pleasaunce is forlorn And emptied of fair women and brave men; The wine-cup now is dry; the music fled: Now know we that our father, Lir, is dead!’ She sang, and ceased, though long the feathered throat Panted with passion of the unuttered song: At last she spake with voice that seemed remote Like echoed voice of one the tombs among: ‘Depart we hence! Better the exile's pain!’ And they: ‘Return we to rough waves again!’ Yet still along that silver mere they lingered Oaring their weeping way by lawn and cape Till evening, purple-stoled and dewy-fingered, O'er heaven's sweet face had woven its veil of crape; And tenderer came from darkening wood and wild The voice far off of woman or of child. And when, far travelling through the fields of ether, The stars successive filled their thrones with light Still to that heaven the glimmering lake beneath her Gave meet response, with music answering light; For still, wherever sailed that mystic four With minstrelsy divine the lake ran o'er. But when the rising sun made visible The night-mist hovering long o'er banks of reed They cast their broad wings on a gathering swell Of wind that, late from eastern sea-caves freed Waved all the island's oakwoods t'ward the West; And seaward swooped at eve and there found rest. And since they knew their penance now was over, Penance that tasks great hearts to purify, Happier were they than e'er was mortal lover, Happy as Spirits cleansed that, near the sky, Feel, 'mid that realm, ‘The Higher Purgatory,’ Warm on their lids the unseen yet nearing glory. Thenceforth they roamed no more, at Inisglaire Their change awaiting. In its blissful prime That island was, men say, as Eden fair The swan-soft nurseling of a changeful clime With amaranth-lighted glades, and tremulous sheen Of trees full-flowered on earth no longer seen. Not then the waves with that still site contended; On its warm sand-hills pansies always bloomed; And ever with the inspiring sea-wind blended Came breath of gardens violet-perfumed; And daisies whitened lawn and dell, and spread At sunset o'er green hills their under-red, Faint as that blush which lights some matron's cheek Tenderly pleased by gentle praise deserved— That island's winding coast from creek to creek Like curves of shells with dream-like beauty swerved: And midmost spread a lake, from mortal eyes Vanished this day like man's lost paradise. Around that lake with oldest oakwoods shaded Were all things that to eye are witching most Green slopes dew-drenched, and grey rocks ivybraided; Yet speechless was the region as a ghost; No whisper shook those woods; no tendril stirred; Nor e'er within the cave was ripple heard. A home for Spirits not home for man it seemed; Or Limbo meet for body-waiting Souls— Of such in Pagan times the poets dreamed: That stillness which invests the unmoving poles Above it brooded. In its circuit wide A second Darvra lived—but glorified. Upon its breast perpetual light there lay Undazzling beam and uncreated light; For lake and wood the sunshine drank all day And breathed it softly forth to cheer the night, A silver twilight pure from cloud or taint Like aureole round the forehead of a saint. There dwelt those Swans; there louder anthems chanted; There first they sang by day—rapt song and hymn Till all those birds the western coasts that haunted Came flying far o'er ocean's purple rim, Scorning thenceforth wild cliff and beds of foam; And made, then first, that sacred isle their home. So passed three years. When dawned the third May morn The Four, while slowly rose the kindling mist Showing the first white on the earliest thorn, Heard music o'er the waters. List, O list! 'Twas sweet as theirs—more sweet—yet terrible At first; and sudden trembling on them fell. A second time it sounded. Terror died And rapture came instead and mystic mirth They knew not whence: and thus Finola cried: ‘Brothers! the Tailkenn treads our Erin's earth!’ And as the lifted mist gave view more large They saw a blue bay with a fair green marge. On that green marge there rose an Altar-stone: Before it, robed in white, with tonsured head, Stood up the kingly Tailkenn all alone: Not far behind, in reverence, not in dread, With low-bent brows a princely senate knelt Girding that altar as with golden belt. Marvelling, as on they sailed that Rite they saw: But, when a third time pealed that Tailkenn's bell, They too their halleluias, though with awe, Blended with his. The Ill Spirits heard their knell, And shrieking fled to penal dungeons drear; And straight, since now those blissful Four drew near, Saint Patrick stretched above the wave his hand, And thus he spake—and wind and wave were stilled— ‘Children of Lir, re-tread your native land, For now your long sea-penance is fulfilled.’ Then lo! Finola raised the funeral cry— ‘We tread our native land that we may die.’ And thus she made the lay, and thus she sang: ‘Baptize us, priest, while living yet we be!’ And louder soon her dirge-like anthem rang: ‘Lo, thus the Children's burial I decree: Make fair our grave where land and ocean meet; And t'ward thy holy Altar place our feet. ‘Upon my left, Fiacre; upon my right Let Aodh sleep; for such their place of rest Secured to each by usage day and night: And lay my little Conn upon my breast: Then on a low sand pillow raise my head, That I may see his face though I be dead.’ She spake; and on the sands they stept—the Four— Then lo, from heaven there came a miracle: Soon as they left the wave and trod the shore The weight of bygone centuries on them fell: To human forms they changed, yet human none;— Dread, shapeless weights of wrinkles and of bone. A moment prone the wildered creatures lay, Then slowly up that breadth of tawny sand, Like wounded beast that can but crawl, made way With knee convulsed and closed and clutching hand, Nine-centuried forms, still breathing mortal breath, Though shrouded in the cerements pale of death. That concourse on them gazed with many a tear; Yet no man uttered speech or motion made, Till now the Four had reached that altar-bier Their ghastly pilgrimage's goal, and laid Before its base their bodies, one by one, And faces glistening in the rising sun. There lying, loud they raised the self-same cry As Patrick o'er them signed the conquering Sign, ‘Baptize us, holy Tailkenn, for we die!’ The saint baptized them in the name Divine, And, swift as thought, their happy spirits at last To God's high feast and singing angels passed. Now hear the latest wonder. While, low-bowed, That concourse gazed upon the reverend dead Behold, like changeful shapes in evening cloud Vanished those time-worn bodies; and, instead, Inwoven lay four children, white and young With silver-lidded eyes and lashes long. Finola lay, once more an eight years' child: Upon her right hand Aodh took his rest, Upon her left Fiacre;—in death they smiled: Her little Conn was cradled on her breast: And all their saintly raiment shone as bright As sea-foam sparkling on a moonlit night; Or as their snowy night-clothes shone of old When now the night was past, and Lir, their sire Upraised them from the warm cot's silken fold And bade them watch the sun's ascending fire, And watched himself its beam, now here now there, Flashed from white foot, blue eyes, or golden hair. The men who saw that death-bed did not weep But gazed till sunset upon each fair face; And then with funeral psalm and anthems deep Interred them at that sacred altar's base, And graved their names in Ogham characters On one white tomb, and, close beneath them, Lir's. Those Babes were Erin's Holy Innocents, And first-fruits of the land to Christ their Lord, Though born within the unbelievers' tents: Figured in them the Gael his God adored, That later-coming, holier Gael, who won Through Faith the birthright, though the younger son. EARLY IRISH RECORDS. THE BALLAD OF KING CORMAC'S CHOICE. According to the Irish chronicles, Cormac, King of all Ireland, renounced the worship of idols about two centuries before the arrival of St. Patrick, having received in a vision the promise of the true Faith. Who shall forbid a king to lie Where lie he will, when life is o'er? King Cormac laid him down to die; But first he raised his hand and swore; ‘At Brugh ye shall not lay my bones: Those pagan Kings I scorn to join Beside the trembling Druid stones, And on the northern bank of Boyne. ‘A grassy grave of poor degree Upon its southern marge be mine At Rossnaree, where of things to be I saw in vision the pledge and sign. ‘Thou happier Faith, that from the East Slow travellest, set my People free! I sleep, thy prophet and thy priest, By southern Boyne, at Rossnaree.’ He died: anon from hill and wood Down flocked the black-robed Druid race And round the darkened palace stood And cursed the dead King to his face, Uptowering round his bed, with lips Denouncing doom, and cheeks death-pale, As when at noontide strange eclipse Invests grey cliff and shadowed vale; And proved with cymbal'd anthems dread The Gods he spurned had bade him die:— Then spake the pagan chiefs and said ‘Where lie our Kings, this King must lie.’ In royal robes the corse they dressed; They spread the bier with boughs of yew; And chose twelve men, their first and best, To bear him through the Boyne to Brugh. But on his bier the great dead King Forgat not so his kingly oath; And from sea-marge to mountain spring Boyne heard their coming, and was wroth: He frowned far off 'mid gorse and fern As those ill-omened steps made way; He muttered 'neath the flying hern; He foamed by cairn and cromlech grey; And rose, and drowned with one black wave Those Twelve on-wading; and with glee Bore down King Cormac to his grave By southern Boyne, at Rossnaree! Close by that grave, three centuries past, Columba reared his saintly cell; And Boyne's rough voice was changed at last To music by the Christian bell. So Christ's true Faith made Erin free, And blessed her women and her men; And that which was again shall be, And that which died shall rise again. ST. COLUMBA'S FAREWELL TO THE ISLE OF ARRAN ON SETTING SAIL FOR IONA. FROM THE GAELIC. Farewell to Arran Isle, In the Bay of Galway. It was one of the chief retreats of the Irish monks and missionaries, and still abounds in religious memorials. farewell! I steer for Hy: Iona. my heart is sore:— The breakers burst, the billows swell 'Twixt Arran Isle and Alba's Scotland. shore. Thus spake the Son of God, ‘Depart!— O Arran Isle, God's will be done! By Angels thronged this hour thou art: I sit within my bark alone. O Modan, well for thee the while! Fair falls thy lot, and well art thou! Thy seat is set in Arran Isle: Eastward to Alba turns my prow. O Arran, Sun of all the West! My heart is thine! As sweet to close Our dying eyes in thee as rest Where Peter and where Paul repose. O Arran, Sun of all the West! My heart in thee its grave hath found: He walks in regions of the blest The man that hears thy church-bells sound. O Arran blest, O Arran blest! Accursed the man that loves not thee! The dead man cradled in thy breast— No demon scares him: well is he. Each Sunday Gabriel from on high, For so did Christ our Lord ordain, Thy Masses comes to sanctify: With fifty angels in his train Each Monday Michael issues forth To bless anew each sacred fane: Each Tuesday cometh Raphael To bless pure hearth and golden grain. Each Wednesday cometh Uriel, Each Thursday Sariel, fresh from God; Each Friday cometh Ramael To bless thy stones and bless thy sod. Each Saturday comes Mary, Comes Babe on arm, 'mid heavenly hosts: O Arran, near to heaven is he That hears God's Angels bless thy coasts! SAINT COLUMBA'S STORK. A MINSTREL SONG. Columba raised in wrath a war; Heart-stricken then for penance prayed: ‘See thou thy native land no more:’— The Hermit spake: the Saint obeyed. He sailed: he reached an island green: Alone he clomb its grassy steep: Though dimly, Eire could still be seen: Once more he launched into the deep. Iona's soil at last he trod. There, there once more, they say he mixed His hymns of Eire with hymns of God Standing with dim eyes southward fixed. Three years went by. One stormy morn He grasped a Monk that near him stood: ‘Go down to yonder beach forlorn O'er which the northward sea-mists scud. ‘There, bleeding thou shalt find ere long A Stork from Eire that loves her well Sore wounded by the tempest's wrong: Uplift and bear her to thy cell. ‘Three days that Stork shall be thy guest: The fourth o'er yonder raging main The exile, strong through food and rest, Will seek her native Eire again.’ The Monk obeyed: that Stork he found And fed, three days. Those three days o'er The exile, soaring, gazed around, Then winged her to her native shore. The Harper ended. Loud and shrill They raised their shout, and praised that Stork, And praised the Saint that, exiled, still Could sing for Eire; for God could work. ST. BRIGID She died a.d. 523. AND THE BLIND NUN. St. Brigid is the mother, all men know, Of Erin's nuns that have been or shall be From great St. Patrick's time to that last day When Christ returns to judge the world with fire. Her life was full of marvels; here is one Some deem than miracle miraculous more. 'Twas summer eve: upon a grassy slope Which overlooks Cill Dara's Now Kildare. boundless plain She sat, and by her side a fair blind nun Of them that followed her and loved her rule, And sang her nocturn psalms. They spake of God, The wonder of His dread inscrutable Being, Round all, o'er all, in all; the wonder next That man, so slight a thing, can move His love, Can love Him, can obey: the marvel last Of God made Man; the Infinite in greatness By infinite descent a creature made, Perchance within the least of peopled worlds For saving of all worlds. The sun went down: Full-faced the moon uprose: the night-wind sighed: It broke not their discourse. For them it swayed Not Dara's oaks but boughs of Olivet, Brightened their midnight dews. The dawn returned: It flushed the clouds: it fired the forest's roof: It laughed on distant streams. The splendour burned In the green grass and lived in brake and bush: Transfigured earth upreared a face as when Man—his terrestrial to celestial changed— Shall look upon his Maker; such a face As angel-hosts raised to God's universe When, first evoked, it burst upon their sight From night primeval and that chaos old. St. Brigid gazed upon that dawn: a thought Keen as a lance transfixed her heart: she mused, ‘Alas, this poor blind Sister sees it not!’ She clasped that Sister's hand, she raised, she kissed it: That blind one spake: ‘Why weepest thou, Mother mine? Thy tears are on my hand!’ The Saint replied; ‘I weep because thou canst not see yon dawn, Nor in it God's great glory.’ Then the nun; ‘If that thought grieves thee, pray and I shall see.’ St. Brigid knelt; and, lo, the blind one saw! 'Twere sin to paint in words that creature's gladness: It lasted long: it passed: by slow degrees A twilight shadow tinged the sweet, pale face: She spake: ‘Great Mother, you can watch yon dawn Yet nothing lose of that more heavenly vision Which lights God's inner realm within our hearts. That inner world hath been my comfort; there Ever I saw my Jesus, first a Babe Couched in His crib, a Boy within the Temple, At Cana's marriage feast, by Lazarus' tomb, Upon the mount of His Beatitudes, Upon the mount of His Transfiguration; I tracked His steps through fields of Palestine; I heard His Parables; I saw Him lay His hand upon the blind, the dumb, the dead; I knew that voice in all its holy changes, His footstep, and the joy upon the face Of those who heard that footstep though far off Martha, or Mary, or the loved disciple; Daily these things I saw:—that vision pales, Dazed by the earthly splendours of this dawn, Dim as earth dimmed when blindness near me drew. Never be blindness mine to heavenly things! Still let me feel when other help is none That God is nearest to me, Mother mine! A weakling I; grant me what weaklings need! Kneel down once more, and give me back my blindness.’ Then knelt the Saint and prayed once more, and God Restored to her she loved her holy blindness: For forty years it lasted: then she died. THE BALLAD OF TURGESIUS THE DANE; OR, THE GIRL-DELIVERER. The people sat amid the dust and wept: ‘In darker days than these God burst the chain,’ (Thus sang the harper as the chords he swept,) ‘Hear of the Girl-Deliverer and the Dane.’ PART I. Twin ivy wreaths her forehead wound, A green wreath and a yellow: Her hair a gleaming dusk in ground With ends of sunshine mellow. Fair rose her head the tall neck o'er; Her neck in snows was bedded: Some crown, they swore, unseen she bore— That queenly head it steadied. Her sable vest in front was laced With laces red as coral; Her golden zone in gems was traced With leafy type and moral. As treading hearts her small feet went In love-suspended fleetness: And hearts thus trodden forth had sent An organ-sob of sweetness. Upon the dais when she stept Meath's peopled hall rang loudly: Their hundred harps the minstrels swept: Her sire looked round him proudly. The Dane beside him, darkening, sate, At once his guest and victor; Green Erin's scourge—the true King's fate— The sceptred serf's protector. ‘Sir King! our worship grows but small! Here Gaels alone find honour: A white girl cannot cross your hall But all men gaze upon her! ‘My speech is short: yon stands my fort! Ere three nights thither send her With twenty maidens of her court, Your fairest, to attend her.’ PART II. The Dane strides o'er his stony floor, A strong, fierce man, yet hoary: The low sun fires the purple moor With mingled gloom and glory. The tyrant stops; he stares thereon: Sun-touched, his armour flashes: His rough grey hair a glow hath won Like embers seen through ashes. His mail'd hand grasps his tangled beard: He laughs that red sun watching, Till the roofs laugh back like a forest weird The laughter of Wood-gods catching. ‘My Sea-Kings! mark yon furnace-sheen! The Fire-god is not thrifty! No flame like that these eyes have seen For winters five-and-fifty! ‘My sire lay dead: the ship sailed north, The pyre and the corse on bearing: Six miles it sailed; the flame sprang forth Like sea-vext Hecla glaring! ‘We'll pledge him to-night in the blood-red wine: 'Tis wrought, the task he set me! From coast to coast this Isle is mine: Not soon will her sons forget me! ‘I have burned their shrines and their cities sacked; Their Fair Ones our castles cumber; We were shamed to-night if the bevy lacked The fairest from their number. ‘Young wives for us all; too many by half! Strange mates—the hind with the dragon!’ He laughed as when the reveller's laugh Rings back from the half-drained flagon. PART III. The girl hath prayed at her Mother's grave, And kissed that grave, and risen: She hath swathed a knife in a silken glaive: She is calm, but her great eyes glisten. Between silk vest and spotless breast A dagger she hath hidden; With lips compressed gone forth, a guest Unhonoured—not unbidden. Through moonshine wan on moves she, on: But who are those, the others? They are garbed like maids, but maids are none: They are lovers of maids, and brothers. The gates lie wide: they enter in: Loud roars the riot and wassail: They hear at times 'mid the conquerors' din The harp of the Gaelic vassal. The Dane has laid on her head his hand, The love in his eye is cruel: Out leap the swords of that well-masked band: Two nations have met in duel! 'Twas God their sentence on high that wrote! 'Tis a righteous doom—that slaughter! His Sea-Kings lie drowned in the castle moat, And the Tyrant in Annin Water. From mountain to mountain the tidings flashed: It pealed from turret to turret: Like a sunlit storm o'er the plains it dashed: It hung o'er the vales like a spirit. 'Twas a maiden's honour that crowned the right: 'Twas a vestal claim, scarce noted By the power which trampled it out of sight, That rose on the wrong, and smote it! THE BATTLE OF CLONTARF; OR, THE KING'S SACRIFICE. The battle of Clontarf, fought A.D. 1014, annulled for ever the Danish power in Ireland. During two centuries and more the sons of the North had landed on the Irish coasts, sacked the monasteries, burned the cities and churches, and in many places well-nigh destroyed the Christian civilisation of earlier times, although they were never able to establish a monarchy in Ireland. The native dynasties for the most part remained; and Brian the Great, then King of all Ireland, though aged and blind, led Forth the native hosts against the invaders for one supreme effort. He placed his son Murrough in command; but he offered up, notwithstanding, his life for his country, and the lives of all the Royal Family. His sons and his grandson partook his glory and his fate. His death was a favourite theme with the bards of ancient Erin. By green Clontarf they thronged the unhappy shore Whence James had fleeted like a transient guest:— ‘We had Kings of late; we had Kings of yore,’ Thus sang the Bard; ‘but the first were best!’ And the shouts of the anguished around him rang, From streaming eyes forth flashed the fire As thus King Brian's death he sang, The blind old King who died for Eire. I. ‘Answer, thou that from the height Look'st to left, and look'st to right, Answer thou, how goes the fight?’ II. Thus spake King Brian, by his tent Kneeling, with sceptred hands that leant Upon that altar which, where'er He marched, kept pure his path with prayer; For after all his triumphs past That made him wondrous 'mid his peers On the blind King God's will had cast The burden of his fourscore years: And therefore when that morn, at nine He rode along the battle's van No sword he lifted but the Sign Of Him Who died for man. King Brian's fleshly strength decayed, Three times in puissance waxed his spirit And tall like oak-trees towered his merit, And like a praying host he prayed:— From nine to twelve, with crown on head, Full fifty prayers the King had said; And unto each such power was given It shook the unopening gates of heaven. III. ‘O King, the battle goes this hour As when two seas are met in might, When billow billow doth devour, And tide with tide doth fight: ‘I watch the waves of war; but none Can see what banners rise or fall; Sea-clouds on rush, sea-crests on run And blood is over all.’ IV. Then prayed the King once more, head-bare And made himself a cross in prayer, With outstretched arms, and forehead prone Staid on that topmost altar-stone Gem-charged, and cleansed from mortal taint And strong with bones of many a Saint. In youth his heart for God had yearned, And Eire: now thrice his youth returned: A child full oft, ere woke the bird The convent's nocturns he had heard, In old Kincora, or that isle Which guards, thus late, its wasted pile While winds of night the tall towers shook; And he would peer into that Book Which lay, lamp-lit, on eagle's wings Wherein God's Saints in gold and blue Stood up, and Prophets stood, and Kings; And he the Martyrs knew, And Maids, and Confessors each one, And—tabernacled there in light— That blissful Virgin enough bright To light a burnt-out sun. The blazoned Letters well he kenned That stood like gateways keeping ward, Before the Feast-Days set, to guard Long ways of wisdom without end: He knew the music notes black-barred And music notes, like planted spears, Whereon who bends a fixed regard The gathering anthem hears Like wakening storms 'mid pines that lean Ere sunrise o'er some dusk ravine.— The thoughts that nursed his youth, that hour Were with his age, and armed with power. V. So fifty Psalms he sang, and then Rolled round his sightless eyes again And spake—‘Thou watcher on the height, Make answer quick, how goes the fight?’ VI. ‘O King, the battle goes as when The mill-wheel circles round and round: The battle reels; and bones of men Beneath its wheel are ground: ‘The war-field lies like Tomar's wood By axes marred or charred with fire When, black o'er wood-ways ruin-strewed, Rises the last oak spire.’ VII. Then to his altar by the tent Once more King Brian turned, and bent Unsceptred hands and head discrowned Down from that altar to the ground In such sort that the cold March air With fir-cones swept his snow-white hair; And prayed, ‘O Thou that from the skies Dost see what is, and what must be, Make mine and me Thy Sacrifice, But set this People free!’ VIII. That hour, he knew, in many a fane Late ravaged by the Pagan Dane God's priests were offering, far and wide, The Mass of the Presanctified: For lo! it was Good Friday morn, And Christ once more was crowned with thorn: God's Church, he knew, from niche and shrine Had swept those gauds that time consumes, Whate'er sea-cave, or wood, or mine Yield from their sunless wombs: Veiled were the sacred images He knew, like vapour-shrouded trees, Vanished gold lamp, and chalice rare; The astonished altars stripped and bare Because upon the cross, stone-dead, Christ lay that hour disraimented. IX. He prayed—then spake—‘How goes the fight?’ Then answer reached him from the height:— X. ‘O King, the battle goes as though God weighed two nations in His scale; And now the fates of Eire sink low, Now theirs that wear the mail: ‘O King, thy sons, through God's decree, Are dead—save one, the best of all, Murrough—and now, ah woe is me! I see his standard fall!’ XI. It fell: but as it fell, above Through lightning-lighted skies on drove A thousand heavenly standards, dyed In martyrdom's ensanguined tide; And every tower, and town, and fane That blazed of old round Erin's shore Down crashed, it seemed, in heaven again;— So dire that thunder's roar! The wrath had come: the Danes gave way: For Brian's prayer had power that day; Seaward they rushed, the race abhorred— The sword of prayer had quelled their sword. So fled they to the ship-thronged coast; But, random-borne through Tolga's glade A remnant from that routed host Rushed by where Brian prayed; And, swinging forth his brand, down leap'd Black Brodar, he that foremost rode And from the kingly shoulders swept The old head, praising God; And cried aloud, ‘Let all men tell That Brodar, he that leagues with Hell, That Brodar of the magic mail Slew Brian of the Gael.’ XII. Him God destroyed! The Accursed One lay Like beast unburied where he fell: But Brian and his sons this day In Armagh Church sleep well. And Brian's grandson strong and fair Clutching a Sea-King by the hair Went with him far through Tolga's wave— Went with him to the same sea-grave. So Eire gave thanks to God, though sad, And took the blessing and the bale, And sang, in funeral garments clad, The vengeance of the Gael. Silent all night the Northmen haled Their dead adown the bleeding wharf:— Far north at dawn the Pirates sailed; But on thy shore, Clontarf, Old Eire once more, with wan cheeks wet Gave thanks that He Who shakes the skies Had burst His people's bond, and yet Decreed that Sacrifice: For God is One Who gives and takes; Who lifts the low, and fells the proud; Who loves His land of Eire, and makes His rainbow in His cloud. Thus sang to Eire her Bard of old; Thus sang to trampled kerne and serf While, sunset-like, her age of gold Came back to green Clontarf.</field>

The foe in sight, instant he knew their numbers; If distant, guessed their whereabout—how lay The intermediate tract—if fordable The streams—the vales accessible to horse: 'Twas like the craft of beasts remote from man. Phi. Father, you ever boast the king reveres you; I say, he flouts you in the army's face: You rail; but still he conquers. Par. Son, 'tis so; Young gamesters have their luck. Phi. He slights you daily, And for your sake slights me. Last eve he passed me (His hand was heavy on Hephestion's shoulder, The Phalanx saw it, and the Silver Shields), Vouchsafing me no word. Scene II.—Troy. Hephestion, Seleucus, Craterus, Citizens, Priests. Cra. He likes not Troy. His gaze, that's onward ever, Like gaze of one that watches for the dawn, Is bent to the earth. Sel. Far otherwise it beamed When, in mid channel, lifting high the bowl, He poured to great Poseidon and the nymphs Their dues; far other when he flung far forth Nighing the shore, his spear that shook for gladness, Rooted in Asia's soil! Alexander joins them, attended by Hephestion. Tro. Cit. Great King of Greeks! Welcome! Atrides treads once more in Troy! Alex. Where is Achilles' fane—mine ancestor's? I see it not. Tro. Priest. No fanes stand here to mortals. Alex. Ay, mortal was his sire. His arms, where are they? 2nd Cit. Ulysses won them by the Greeks' decree. Alex. The Greeks! I knew you Phrygian by your garb And medicated voice. Whose fane is that? 2nd Cit. 'Tis Aphrodite's, sire, that won the prize On yonder Ida. Alex. Ay, your Aphrodite! She that, the Helena among the gods— I ever scorned that son of hers, Æneas: But for his mother's veil around him flung Tydides' hand had slain him. Troy consumed, Where fled he? Tro. Priest. First to Carthage; next to Rome: He founded there a State. Alex. A fugitive Then founded what a bandit horde built up: The twain were aptly yoked. That State shall crumble. Whose fane is this? 'tis small, but fair. Tro. Priest. Athenè's. Alex. A man may enter this, and unashamed: What arms are those that shine from yonder wall? Tro. Priest. The arms of Greeks who died at Troy. Alex. Remove them! Into whatever battle-field I ride, Those arms shall go before me. Where they hang Suspend the panoply I wear. Athenè, This night 'tis dedicate to thee. A Tro. Cit. Great king! Behold the boast of Troy! My kindred guard it— The lyre of Helen's husband! Alex. Mark, Hephestion, The legend-mongers at their work! 'Twas thus They forged in Macedon that preposterous tale, Scandalous alike to me and to my mother, Touching great Zeus. It made the God my sire: 'Twas false! my mother to her lord was true Till, wronged, she slew him. Juggler, your lyre's a lie! Show it to girls! I seek Achilles' tomb. Hephestion, be thou with me. Sirs, farewell. [Alexander and Hephestion walk on together. Scene III.—Troy. The Portico of Aphrodite's Temple. Philotas and Phylax. Phi. Banquet at sunset! Yonder priest morose Has barred those gates, and swears the keys are stolen! Our revel must be here: we'll have at feast All wit and wisdom extant in our host;— I am its Wit, and you, good Leech, its Wisdom! You know my cooks of old! I pray you, Phylax, Teach them to make the dish that richliest spiced The wholesomest likewise! I have wealth and beauty, My father's greatness, and the army's love: One thing remains which men like me must fear— Sickness; a serious sickness. Phy. Sage, though young! Our craft was born to make delights less baneful. Phi. You shun delights yourself: I pardon you, Knowing your sour mood comes from spite, not virtue: Age should have spite: with scoffs the dry lip quickens:— We are friends albeit unlike. Phy. Unlike in likeness: We both speak truth: in youth I lived like you: Age—if it comes—in time will make you acrid;— If—for the vain like you, have many foes: I am anatomist; 'neath the flesh that is Mine eye notes still the skeleton to be Whose grin diverts me better than youth's smile. How like you battle-fields? Phi. In thought, not much: But when the trumpets sound their music warms me: Not less my valour is a reasoning thing: In the onset fenced am I by huge strong men Whose fortunes rest on mine. There's Ptolemy! I call him “Empty head and stately step!” I'd rather dine upon that man than with him! Phylax, I think you love me! Phy. In my way— Not with that love which fain would die to save you, Yet love enough to avenge if slain by wrong. Phi. A league! Phy. I swear. Phi. Good friend, be here at sunset! Scene IV.—Troy: near the Tomb of Achilles. Alexander and Hephestion. Alex. My master ofttimes, the wise Stagyrite, Condemn'd the Passions, branded them as a yoke Which Action's strenuous sons should scorn to bear, And chiefly praised the Tragic Muse for this, That, showing these as monsters, she with fire Of Pity and Terror cleanses the clear soul Lifted above all passions. This is Troy! Dreamland ends here. Heph. Alas! how small an urn Suffices for the earth-o' erstriding dust Which one time shook the world! Alex. Must they too shrink, Simois, and yon Scamander! Children ford The flood that drown'd Greek warriors! Here the Sphinx Makes banquet large: her riddle's hard to read. That Ten Years' War, what fruit thereof remains? What empire lives, its witness and its crown? What shall we say? That those were common men Made large by mists of Time? Or shall we rather Conclude them real, and our age a fraud; Determine that in them old Homer saw Some greatness hidden from the blinded herd; Foresaw some far result? Heph. Sir, from Achilles Descendeth not Olympias? Alex. Ay. Heph. Through her The spirit of the Strong Ones came on you: I make my answer thus. The Trojan War Begins its work decreed—in you begins it: It finds not end in ashes and a song: The empire you shall found must stand its witness. But hush! The Tomb is here: the headstone o'er it Half lost in brambles! Alex. (Anointing the pillar on the grave of Achilles). Mighty Sire, Achilles! Lift from the dimness of the dolorous realm Thy face upon thy son! In it—I see it— Survives, though sad, the unvanquishable youth; In it alone. The phantom of a spear Is all that now can weight that phantom hand Which awed the Atridæ; and as though chain-bound Move the swift feet that once outsped thy mother's Bounding from wave to wave; yet, not the less, Monarch thou walkest. 'Mid the Strengthless Heads That, reverent, round thee flock—like thee lamenting, Despite the embalm'd purpureal airs and gleam Immeasurable of amaranthine meads, Lamenting still the strenuous airs of earth, And blasts from battlefields; like thee detesting That frustrate, stagnant, ineffectual bourne Where substance melts to shadow—lift, great king, Once more from out the gloom a face sun-bright, Elysium's wonder, on thy son's, and hear him: To thee this day he consecrates his greatness: Whate'er malign and intercepting Death Detracted from thy greatness he concedes thee; Remands thee from the gulf the deed unborn; Yields thee, ere won, his victory and his empire: This is the anointing, this the sacrifice, Wherewith he crowns thy tomb. [After a pause. The night descends. Hephestion, I depart. [Hephestion crowns the pillar on the grave of Patroclus, and rejoins Alexander. Alex. You tarried:—wherefore? Heph. For justice's sake, and friendship's. Is there room For nothing, then, but greatness on the earth? I crown'd that other tomb. Alex. What tomb? Heph. It stood Close by, the loftier;—greater love had raised it; Patroclus' tomb. Alex. 'Tis strange I marked it not. Heph. These two were friends. Alex. Ay; nor in death divided. Heph. Therefore, despite that insolent cynic sect, The gods have care for things on earth. Alex. Hephestion! That which Patroclus to Achilles was Art thou to me—my nearest and mine inmost. In them, not lives alone, but fates were join'd: Patroclus died; Achilles follow'd soon. But lo, that glare! Abydos glances forth Through the olive copse far off. A thousand wrinkles Even now run up Parmenio's wintry brows Shaping our battle's scheme. It rests not with him; Yet be it his in fancy! Scene V.—The Palace at Susa. The Queen of Persia. The Queen. The morn is stiller than the night. How sweetly The green of yon tall garden-trees o'erlays Those golden bars of stationary light That cut the marbles of the palace floor! How pleasant, too, that fount's monotonous chime, Wakening the self-same echoes in the courts They heard in bygone years! May no change come! [Arsinoe and the other royal children enter. Ars. Here is a lily, mother, pluck'd at dawn: The dews were on it thick; upon the dews I laid my kiss, because for you 'twas destined: Now dews and kiss are gone! The Queen. The dews lie yet Bright on your curls; I drop my kiss upon them: May never rude hand touch my flower! You caught The Spring asleep, and caged it in your bosom; I feel its songsters there! A Younger Child. Mother! We found A plant that showed us butterflies for blossoms: We clapp'd our hands to fright them, but they moved not! The Queen. I see no butterflies; but these warm hands Are more to me. This is your father's birthday. He has heard ill tidings. Ars. Tidings! I remember Some gardeners told us, but in mockery only, 'Twas said that pirates from an isle far off Which one time had been liegeful to our Persia, Wild men who drag their living from sea-waves, By hunger roused to wrath had flung themselves In war against mankind. We'll sell our gems, And bid them purchase bread. The Queen. Their king invades us: From hill to hill our watch-fires flashed the news. The Younger Child. How fair that sight must be! May we not see it? The Queen. That sight! Ah, child, thou know'st not what it means! It means the torch laid to the poor man's roof: The hamlet—older than these Halls—a-flaming! It means the mother's wail; the shriek of babe Half mad with fear, yet knowing not the danger! It means that awful silence of the brave When hope is past. It means the stream blood-red: It means the lately disunited lips Of lovers, blanched with death. It means a life Made frustrate, and the grey-beard weeping sore Above the ruined lands his youth reclaimed. [A pause. She proceeds. It means God's world become the prey of demons: It means worst passions lion-like unbound. Ah me! ah me! A Lady. The great, sweet eyes grow wild! She sees that wreck! The Queen. Thank God, this Persian Realm Though vast, is unaggressive—Persia's king, Oh how unlike this king of savage hordes! Ars. I thought all kings were righteous, kind, paternal! How old may be his kingdom? The Queen. 'Tis a realm Novel, yet proud; made up of rocks and vales, With here and there a field where corn can grow; 'Tis smaller than our smallest Persian province. Astar (entering). Gone mad at last! They've much to make them mad! They're mad with false philosophies, and schemes For building cloudy fabrics, brief as clouds, Which they style Polities. They're mad, beside, With orators that rouse to tempest mood The popular sea wrath-ridden. They're madder yet With rival altars and with warring gods More bestial than themselves. Their Greece lay long Prone in her intertangled, blind republics, A knot of serpents glistening in the sun: This day, in Alexander raised too late, She stands erect—to die. Ars. Can nothing save them? Ast. In three weeks more, their heads from Susa's walls Will frown against the sun. Ars. Not so! Not so! 'Twere shame to deal with misery thus. We're strong: The sound must needs compassionate the sick: The wise protect the weak. Ah me, I babble. The Queen. Because your sisters and your head strong brother Name you their Intercessor, and because Your little flock salute you Little Mother, You'd throw your veil above a rebel race, And hide them from their doom! Ars. Plead for them, mother! Our agèd Sisygambis too shall plead: Her heart is great. The Queen. She walk'd a lioness once; Butsince her brethren died she's changed: there's in her A tremor like the tremor in a tree Which staggers o'er the axe. Three nights, moreover, She's vision rack'd. She saw a portent wing'd That storm-like from the West, against the storm, Made way, and smote the East. Ast. The silver altars Lift, day and night, that ever-living flame The witness, bodiless, yet visible, Of Him, that Spirit all-piercing, girdling all things, All-quickening like the sun, though seal'd from sense Lest man should see and die. His hand alone Shines, lightning-like, through error of man's night, Cleansing base shapes, or else, with happier change Of dissolution glorious, raising high And throning in clear skies. Great Persian Realm! Whose stable basis is the strength of man, Whose height his hope; within whose sea-like breadth The storms but wrestle on the lap of calm; The vigil of whose worship draws to earth Her peace; whose centuries, misnamed of slumber, Are fruitfuller to man than cyclic dreams Of seeming-wakeful nations all whose life Is lodged in foot and tongne; great Persian Realm! Let the fly buzz upon thy wall world-wide, The viper creep unheeded till it reaches Thy trampling heel! [An acclaim is heard without. The Queen. That sound might wake the dead! The king returns: his people flock to meet him. Scene VI.—The Western side of the Granicus. The Greek army approaches it. Alexander, Parmenio, and other Generals. Par. The crown of courage, boy, is self-restraint When clamourers goad us. Pitch thy camp. They'll fly: At dawn we pass the flood unquestion'd. Alex. Greeks! To the water's edge! (To Parmenio.) The morning sun would daze us: This hour it spites the foe. Scene VII.—The Eastern bank of the Granicus. The Persian Army commanded by Memnon of Rhodes. With him are Spithridates, Satrap of Lydia, Arsites, Satrap of Phrygia, and others. Mem. There's the famed Phalanx—by yon river's side— Place the horse opposite; in them we're strongest: Arsites, with your Phrygians guard yon bank: Keep the south marge; nor threat them till they're crossing: Then welcome them with javelins. Ars. I misdoubt Our Grecian mercenaries. Mem. They will fight If hearten'd by the event, or anger'd. Place them On yonder rearward hill. The odds are with us. Scene VIII.—The Western bank of the Granicus. Alexander and his Generals. Par. Come what come may, this battle should be lost! A chance may save it, or the gods may save it:— By laws of war this battle should be lost. Alex. You're sure of that? Par. Here all things are against us; The stream is swollen with April-melted snows; The banks are treacherous, the fords infrequent, And shifting with the eddies. Alexander, You fight not here with Thracians. Mark yon mount! Nor Dacian there, nor Mœsian rules the war: Old Rhodian Memnon sets his teeth, and knots The tangle of his wiles to lash you homewards: See him there gather'd on his war-horse staid That 'mid those trivial prancers knows to stand; Firm-set he sits, crook-kneed, with hand o'er eyes That slowly take their survey of the field, A man that deals with war in the way of business. Lo, there, he hurls his horsemen forth in squadrons! Your Phalanx next must cross the flood. What then? The uneven ground will loose their wedged array Like a spread hedgehog. Alex. Shake our standard forth! Let sound the trumpets! Send our battle down, The Macedonian and Pæonian horse, And infantry light-arm'd, upon the right; And on the left the Thracian; in the centre Our moving fortress, fenced with brazen walls, Our Phalanx inexpugnable. Amyntas, See it march, slanting, up the river's bed There where the brighter current marks the shoal: Already hath it served us. Persia's horse Forms opposite, beguiled, on broken ground, That shall not help them. March with shields high held, For turning of their shafts. Scene IX.—The Eastern bank of the Granicus. The Hypaspists, Seleucus, and Cassander. Cas. We have left the waves behind; the worst is over! Their shafts are straws, but these our spears have weight: Thrust them into their faces! So—'tis well: Spoil their fine looks, and spite their Asian brides: Beat out Arabia's unguents from their curls: Spare not the gem-wrought corselet! Sel. Alexander Cried thus,—“My brave Hypaspists landed once, The fight is fought, and won!” I heard him speak it! Have at thee, silken Syrian! Next for thee, Bactrian or Mede! Cas. How long it takes in crossing! The Phalanx boasts itself a tortoise mail'd: It moves as slowly. [He falls, wounded by an arrow. Sel. Well charged, Pæonian horse! That charge has saved us! Good friends, this blood is Persia's more than mine; Pray gods it enter not my veins and taint them With cowardice of Persia! A Soldier. Hark! it thunders! [The Persian cavalry comes up, headed by Mithridates, and at the same moment Alexander from the opposite side.] Alex. (Striking down Mithridates with his spear.) Give that to thy great cousin, King Darius! Rhœ. (Smiting Alexander on the helmet, which bursts asunder.) Hail! Philip's son! Alex. Well aim'd, and nigh the mark! From Philip this! [Pierces his breast; Spithridates, riding up from behind has just raised his sword above Alexander's head when Cleitus severs his arm with a sword-cut.] 'Twas timely; Lanicè Shall thank her brother Cleitus for that stroke; Else had she mourn'd her foster-child. [The Phalanx pushes against the Persian centre, which bends inward. The disorder gradually reaches the extremities of the Persian line, and the Macedonian cavalry breaks through its weaker parts. The left wing, under Parmenio, charges. The whole Persian army falls into rout.] Alex. The field is ours! Persia to Parthian changes! After them, Thracian horse; but not too far! Drive them some twenty stadia; wheeling then, Take in the rear those Grecian mercenaries: At them in front, strong Phalanx! close them round Northward with your Hypaspists, brave Seleucus! These are the Greeks that sold their Greece for gold: Grant others mercy; let no traitor live! How now, Parmenio? Is it their strategy That feigns this politic flight? Par. Sir, all the gods Ride in the train of your triumphant fortune, And hold the gold-cloth o'er your head ablaze; For your sake they reverse all laws of war: I said they might. Eum. Our horse has lost but sixty: The victory's cheap. Alex. See that those dead be honoured With kingly obsequies. No man of their kin Not one, while Greece is Greece, shall stand amerced With civil tax or toll. Ptol. Two thousand prisoners— Alex. We'll not forget them. Let them sweat, foot-chained, In cities both of Macedon and Greece. Eum. The body-guard have lost but twenty-five. Alex. Write on thy tablets, we decree them statues In Pella, where my tomb shall stand one day, My task complete. Lysippus be the sculptor: We grace the Persian dead with funeral rites: They fought in their allegiance. Send to Athens Three hundred suits of armour stripped from these The stone-cold dead: upon the Acropolis See they be ranged—in great Athenè's fane— With this inscription 'neath them: “Alexander, The son of Philip, when the Persian host Fell at Granicus, sent to Greece this spoil: The Grecians holp to take it, save alone The men of Lacedemon.” Grave it in marble. Eum. It shall be so ordain'd. Alex. Hephestion, send Our noblest spoils to Ilium's maiden fane: Let Ilium bear henceforth a city's title. Mith. (the governor of Sardis, arriving). Sardis submits, laying before her king The keys of her great treasury. Alex. Tell me, sir, How many factions rage there in your city? Mith. Two, mighty king, the nobles and the people: The nobles rule. Alex. Their rule is over-ruled: We prop the weaker; they shall need us most. Proclaim to Sardis that all privileges Ravished from her by Persia, we to her Revindicate. To Ephesian Artemis, A goddess friendly still to Macedon, Whose temple at our birth-hour fell by fire, We shall be helpful likewise. Ephesus Herself by penitence shall purge that wrong Done to my father's statue. Tell those realms Betwixt the Euxine and Pamphylian seas, That Grecian galaxy of Lesser Asia, That Argive choir in eastern exile sad, That Doric garland on base Persia's brow, We came not here to crush them, but exalt: This hand shall lift them to their first estate, And lodge them 'mid the skiey heights of Greece. Let it be noised abroad. Scene X.—Near the Granicus. Philotas, Antisthenes. Phi. To me alone he spake no word of honour:— Is that Hephestion's malice, or his own? Ant. His own. This king is valued past his worth: I join'd his march to write his deeds, and note He deigns to touch no book save blind old Homer. He nothing says that's sage, like Ptolemy, Or keen of edge like Craterus. I grant him, Sagacity supreme in observation: He sees with more than sight: seeing with him, Is Act and Thought, not sense. Phi. 'Twas said of old, “Philip is but Parmenio:” others cried In Thrace, “What's Alexander but Philotas!” Yet this is he that scorns me! All save life I'd peril for revenge. Ant. Nor valour here, Nor learning meets its guerdon. Yet remember In scheme or act to place Parmenio first; He's rooted in the popular mind so deep No storm can shake him. Be it whisper'd still, “Parmenio frown'd,” “Parmenio disapproved,” “Parmenio censured much the young man's rashness:” When Fortune swerves the king shall bear the brunt: Parmenio fill his throne. Phi. I hear of plots. Ant. Hear, heed, and hide; but help not. Wait, and win; Let others run the risk. Phi. You'll meet at supper Phylax, my leech. ACT II. Scene I.—A Sea-cliff opposite New Tyre. Alexander (alone). Wings without body! Such—no more—is Commerce Which rests not upon Empire! Commerce, ruling, Disperses man's chief forces; commerce ruled By spirit heroic, yields increase of thoughts That give a wider base to greatness. Tyre! How soon thy golden feathers forth shall fly Upon the storm of War! Lo, where she sits Upon her rock, wave-girt, and turret-crown'd, Gazing toward her western daughter, Carthage!— Tyre of the ships! Phœnicia gave us letters, Which are to mind as fingers to the hand, And shape, dividing, Thought's articulate world:— For Greece she found them, using them not herself; Men stumble thus on glories not for them, The rightful appanage of the capable. The Empire which I found shall tread the earth, Yet ever it go flying. From its vans The twin-born beams of Grecian Song and Science Shall send perpetual dawn. Hephestion, welcome! Heph. (joining him). How long you gaze on yonder beaming sea! It burns mine eyes like fire. Alex. It gladdens mine, Being irradiate and illimitable. Hephestion, hold this map,—the sea-wind curls it— We'll find my City's site. [After a pause. Not Babylon, That vilest of dead Empires—no, not that! Not Nineveh: Persepolis stands too far: Ecbatana's nought, and Susa's Persian only: Byzantium well might serve if north were all. In Egypt is the spot. 'Tis here! I have it! Westward, beyond Pelusium. There the Euxine Thaws in the hot winds from the Arabian Gulf: There meet the east and west: dusk Indian kings Thither shall send their ivory and their gold, And thence to far Hesperia! Heph. I can see it: Hard by Canobus stretches, long and thin, Sharp, like an adder's tongue, a promontory— Alex. It guards the region's harbour, one and sole: Thereon my world's great diadem shall rest: On Alexandria's quays Greek and Egyptian Shall join in traffic: through the populous streets My Phalanx shall return from conquer'd lands; There shall old Egypt lisp our Grecian tongue The Phidian hand subdue the hieroglyph; Athenè share with Isis! Hail, Seleucus! A cloud is on your countenance. Sel. (arriving). Alexander! I have fought your battles, and I love you inly But fawn on no man's follies. What is this? Shall soldiers sweat and toil like beasts of burthen, And I their task-master to pare the wage? Month after month they toil, to make this causeway 'Twixt Ancient Tyre and New; our gallant steeds That chased so oft the foe— Alex. 'Tis well: three stadia The causeway's made. Remains to make the fourth: That done, we reach the gates of Tyre, and knock. Sel. The fourth is thrice the three for time and labour: We're now in deepening water: from its rock Yon city walls ascend two hundred palms: Their arrows gall us: on their towers they raise Huge furnaces. Alex. Seleucus, all is cared for; Two thousand arms have striven three days and more In controversy with the centuried pine On Libanus; in four my towers shall stand High as their towers, and make them large reply. Return, my friend. Tell them their king, ere long, Will lead them into Tyre. (Seleucus departs moodily.) Mark you, Hephestion, They're in one tale, Seleucus and the rest: Seleucus loves me well, nor boasts himself: Another's gloom it is that clouds his brow: Parmenio hates this march to Tyre and Egypt: His mind grows leaner than the threaded sails Of yonder bark so worn the wind goes through them: It holds no thought that's new. I count that man My chief of dangers. 'Tis a desperate game: I'll have no shrewish counsellor near, to shake My soldiers' hearts with cavils. Heph. Old Parmenio Is spleenful when he thinks: he's best in action. Alex. I, who defer not easily to facts Which cross my purpose, see them when they're plain: Those which confront me reason of themselves. Demosthenes, the wonder-working voice, In Athens roars against me. Lacedæmon Pushes her horn, dull Agis, at my sides: Strong-hearted Thebes remembers. In old time But one Thersites stood 'mid many kings; Therein, methinks, great Homer show'd his wit; Those States are, each, Thersites, windier grown, And I their monarch one and sole. If Persia Should join with those, and fire the world behind me, Advance were hard; retreat impossible. Therefore I cleave from Persia Tyre and Egypt, Their ports, their ships, harbours, and mariners; So shall she turn her face from Greece, and I Sleep without dream. I told Parmenio this. Heph. He answered? Alex. Still the old note—“Darius arms: A year, and all his empire will be on you.” Heph. He boasts a million soldiers. Alex. Let them come! A moiety of their numbers fought at Issus. Let him bring up his empire's total strength: Be it embattled, we will bring it under. The enmity I fear is that which lurks A dull swamp-fever in that people's veins Which hates its lord because it scorns itself, And, having striven but half, knows not its limit. This is the hate which bides its time. A realm Shall stand confuted in war's argument Then when its say is said: well silenced, Time Takes still the conqueror's side. Heph. Is there forgiveness For conquerors? Alex. Ay; but for half conquerors, none. The realms which earlier conquerors won, they stole, Using for personal ends. What rule all glorious That primal usurpation counterpoised? What victories swathed the grub in light? What hand Beneficent in sternness, or, if soft, Parental, not seductive, raised on high, With virtue strengthened, or with knowledge lit Those kingdoms subjugate? I wrest them back In the name of honesty and upright dealing, And give them to mankind. If sword of mine Had slept in the iron ore for endless ages, Spurning its call divine, the mocking gods Bending from heaven had swept with menial besom, As from fair pavements, dust, those menial kings, The opprobrium of authentic royalty. The realms I rule shall love me. Heph. Lesser Asia 'Tis true this day is with you. Alex. Persia shall be: But till she does her best, and worst, and fails, The work I work is temporal. Let her do it! Then comes my time:— Strong hand makes empire: hand that heals retains it. I came not to be Cyrus o'er again; Another reign begins. Enough: 'tis late:— How fares that fallen House? Heph. As Patience fares In the extreme of sadness. Sisygambis, Under the great weight of her ninety years, Sits heavy, slowly moving tearless eyes Which seek her son Darius, or, it may be, Her eighty brothers, slaughtered in one day Long since by Ochus. She that was the queen On the queen-mother gazes without speech, And, pitying that high grief, tempers her own. The royal children stand, now glad, now pensive, 'Twixt light and shade. Alex. I chose for them the best, Consigning them to you. Heph. The palace pile Of olden Tyre affords them kind repose: The sea-dirge scarce can pierce its massive walls: There they have woodland shades for grief to hide in, And streams to lull the voice of memory. Those Easterns call such places Paradises, And much affect them. Alex. Seek that aged queen, Hephestion. When my leisure serves I'll see her. Scene II.—The Senate House in New Tyre. Hanno, Hamilcar, Asdrubal, Ithocles, and other Tyrians. Han. He says we're merchants, and in merchant wise We trafficked with him, and equivocated, First sending him in pomp a golden crown, Next, when he fain had offered vows to Melkart, Denying access. Asd. Let him pray outside: He makes no landing here. Ith. We're strong enough, And victuall'd for two years. 'Twixt Greece and Persia The issue hangs in doubt: if Greece should fail, Persia shall be beholden much to us, That kept her foe far from her. If she wins— Ham. Ten citizens have dream'd Apollo's statue, Ta'en 'mid the chiefest spoils when Gela fell, And now by gift of Carthage ours, stood up Beside their beds with stormy brow though bright, And said, “I leave this city.” Asd. Close those gates! Whene'er they're opened such a din comes o'er us From keels half laid, and blasts from new-forged engines, I hear not him that speaks. Ith. The gates, ye slaves! A Herald (entering). Lords of the Senate, hail! Great Carthage honours The queenly womb from which her greatness sprang, Accepts your terms, the Cypriot port, and trade In gums Arabian shared on equal terms, And stands your mate in arms. [Shouts of applause. A Senator. Who speaks of yielding? 2nd Sen. The gods are with us. 3rd Sen. Thus my sentence stands— Bind we with golden chains Apollo's statue To the altar of great Melkart! Tyre's new guest Shall love his city. Thus the Ephesians wrought: And with them bode their god thenceforth in peace. Scene III.—Sea-shore near Old Tyre. Alexander, Ptolemy, Hephestion. Alex. There's truth on earth still extant. Read that missive: Ptol. (reads aloud). “‘The Hebrew people, subject long to Persia, Revolt not. Neither war they with the Greek That wrong'd them not. Their God shall guard His own.’” Alex. These men speak plainly; Tyre prevaricated: These stand at neither side; but Tyre at both: I somewhat love thee, Hierosolyma! I'll find a time ere Tyre has met her doom To look upon that city. Lo, Philotas! [Philotas approaches. He has been a-prospering, and his heart is high. Ptol. 'Tis higher than his head; and that he tosses As though he supp'd with gods. His thoughts, what are they? Brain-bubbles from infructuous restlessness: Alone the slowly-gender'd thought lives long: The rest I deem of as the buzzing swarm Teem'd from the mud of Nile. Phi. Hail, Alexander! Damascus sups with Death! Alex. It ne'er was strong. Phi. Oh, 'tis a mighty city, and a rich! It stands in meads well-water'd, girt with gardens That charge the winds with fragrance. Then the captives! Their ransom shall enrich you with a flood Beggaring the all-gold Pactolus;—princely ladies From Issus, and three daughters of King Ochus; Dead Memnon's widow, and his daughters three. We've clutch'd, 'mid other spoils, Darius' wardrobe! If all Old Tyre were turn'd to theatre, And all our soldiers changed to mimes, the least Might choose his part, and play it with fit garb! I'd end this tedious siege with one great drama, “The tragic comedy of Persia's fall,” (Myself the extempore Aristophanes) And homeward speed next morn! Alex. The royal treasure? Phi. Sir, 'tis a world of ingots and of gems. Alex. That means a fleet. The price of Sidon's paid. Phi. The treasure's well; but oh, the way we won it! Upon an intercepted messenger We found a scroll from him that ruled Damascus, Proffering submission, friendship, and the gold. We sent him back—a smile our only answer— And follow'd to the city. From its gates A long procession issued streaming forth, Sleek courtiers, nobles, magistrates, and priests, Seven thousand beasts of burthen in their midst Beneath the treasure bent. Old Syphax cried, “They'll claim reward.” Like lightning, while they near'd us, As though we took that concourse huge for war, We hurled on them a squadron of our horse, With orders not to spare. The sight was merry: The wonder in their stupid eyes upturn'd Surpass'd, methought, the terror! Alex. A deed accursed, Hateful to all the gods, to me, your king, Opprobrious, and the total state of Greece, Your father wrought, and you, than him more vile, So much his weakness leans upon your folly. Necessities of war compel at times Complicity with traitors: double treason Traitors themselves abhor. Corrupt them first, Then cheat and slay them! Name of Macedon! With what a clownish shoon have knaves in dance, Yea, thine own children trampled thee to mud, Pale Persia's scorn! The Dacian had not done it! I'll learn of this at large from men not false And with just vengeance wash my household clean. Back to Damascus! Send your father hither Andromachus shall rule there in his stead. I'll trust no more Parmenio with that honour Which he dishonours [Philotas makes obeisance and retires. After him, Ptolemy! He'll bruit abroad this massacre. Lo, Hephestion, How thin a varnish coats the ingrain'd baseness Of these new-mounted upstarts! Kings and trinkets Have eaten out his honest heart! In Thrace Man-like he fought: the man has swell'd to boyhood, Vainglorious, petulant, restless, garrulous, loud, The prey of his necessities. Beware him! A man of faculties without a head; Passions, but yet no heart. His cruelty Finds provocation still in mirth, not anger. Heph. I've noted that long since. The man's still young: Coldness in youth is twice the cold of eld: Beneath the ashes of a fire burnt out Some heat may lurk; but from the unfuell'd hearth And dusk bars of a never-lighted fire The chillness comes of death. Not Macedon, 'Twas warm Greece taught me that. Alex. Beware the man! Twice, while I rated him, he glanced at you With sidelong eye. He'll hurt you when he may. Scene IV.—The Causeway between Old and New Tyre. Phylax, Antisthenes. Ant. Methinks our king grows proud. Phy. It is high diet Turns pack-horse into charger. The o'er-fed gods Are emulous pampering this youth with triumphs. Ant. Let him take Tyre, and then he may be proud; But if he fails, these fingers shall record it, “At Tyre it was the Greeks first call'd him proud.” Our patron loves him not, nor loves Hephestion. Phy. Philotas hates the king; but scorns Hephestion: Our patron's hasty. Time befriends the slow. Scene V.—The Gardens of the Palace at Old Tyre. Hephestion, Arsinoe. Ars. Hephestion, well return'd! My mother sits To-day recluse. She bade me show you flowers: Here is a rose unblown. My mother thinks God made the world for peace, not war, Hephestion, Or he had never planted roses in it; But what think you? Heph. Princess, the rose hath thorns: 'Tis sweetness mixed with sharpness: such is war. I see your cousin walks beneath the palms. Ars. Is she not fair? Heph. None fairer. Three days since Passing, she fix'd on us her great blue eyes, That seem'd to shine through tears. Ars. They're tearful ever: She is an orphan, nursed within our house: She told you once that we were like two sisters; But more she loves me far than sisters love. Amastris reads—her wont—a book all gold: 'Tis full of songs: I fear they're chiefly war-songs. Were there in all times wars? Heph. Princess, there were: Our Homer sang of battles. Ars. Think you not He sang of battles in his songs' behoof, Lest, singing only little lays of love, Strong hearts had scorn'd his music? This I know, War is not hatred only; for our king, Hearing of some great deed your king had wrought, Some deed both just and brave, lifted his hands And pray'd—“Preserve, Dread Power, this Persian crown! Yet, if from us thou rend it, let it light On Alexander's brows!” Heph. That was a prayer Fit for a king! Ars. Your king in reverence greets Our Sisygambis with a “mother's” name: And yet, methinks, he neither loves nor hates. Heph. He loves not many, and himself the least: His purposes to him are wife and child. He couch'd on frosty rocks while huddled crowds Shut out the watch fires. When the summer heat More late had dried the marrow in our bones, And now, a spring discover'd, crawling came A soldier with a water-cup, one moment He gazed into the eyes of those around, Then pour'd that water on the sands. Alone He would not drink it. Ars. Ask me not, Hephestion, To love your king, or wish him what you wish: That were, in me, disloyal, faithless, false; I needs must wish him failure. Oh for the time When all the good shall war on all things evil, And none upon each other! It shall come! The Light shall vanquish Dark. Who made mankind Will tell us, one day, all we need to know. Heph. Then why so late? Ars. No doubt that man may learn His need of light, and prize it well when granted; For thus by question apt, and feign'd delay, Parent in child quickens the appetite For knowledge first, and after that rewards it; And what are years—or ages—to a god? Then wars shall cease. Heph. War is an instinct, princess; The gods have given it, and the god-like praised: It lifts us o'er the petty love of life, The quest for pleasure, and the greed for gold; It makes a nation's manhood; stifles factions; Crowns the great head watching the whole night long For them that sleep. War, like a healthful tempest, Scatters the infection. Ars. Ah, the Greek is hard! I guess'd it once; I know it now. Last year I saw a palace fill'd with Grecian statues: How beautiful they were; but yet how loveless! Sweetness was theirs, and majesty, and grace; Yet theirs, methought, a world that knew no pity: A thing hard-hearted seem'd your Grecian Art. Our art was rule: Persia held high her head;— The Power Divine beheld, and brought it low: What if the heart of Greece should turn to stone? Shall she escape? Heph. I have had my boding thoughts:— She's great in war. Ars. Praise not that murderer, War! Persia had Empery; Greece hath Art and Science: Why not content them, each, with what she hath? Or as a youth in marriage takes a maid, And of these twain a lovely race is born, Why should not warring nations wed their gifts And breed some god-like gain? What hope from war? What fruit but breaking hearts? Heph. That shade comes o'er you Which veil'd you when we met:—when, Issus won, The king and I entered a wailing tent With speed to tell you that your father lived. Ars. How gentle seem'd you then! He, too, was gentle: We knelt to you, misdeeming you the king: Your king but laugh'd. He lacked not royal face, Albeit too eager-eyed. Heph. The other Greeks, Of them what say you? Ars. They are light and boastful, Save Ptolemy, upon whose grave, broad brow Empire might sit: they spurn the earth, not tread it: Here is the one I like the least. Abide Till he is gone, Hephestion. Phi. (approaching). Beam and breeze, Maiden, to you, and these, the inferior flowers, Are boon alike. Suspecting in that rose Your beauty's future rival you were wise To pluck it still unblown. You'll prove as kind Bestowing it on me. Ars. The Royal House Accords its gifts to those who claim them least: I pluck'd it for Hephestion. Phi. He is happy: The favourites of a prince are favourites still With those around him—nobles, courtiers, captives— Warriors alone, attent on graver cares, Catch not the lesser whispers of a court: Rustlings of silk for others, not for them, Reveal their oracles. Ars. Hephestion— Phi. Lady, Your mother, doubtless, would have news of friends Housed in Damascus: I am lately thence. Ars. Her majesty sojourns with the palace: It may be she will see you. Phi. Lady, farewell! [Aside, departing. One day Hephestion shall remember this. Ars. He's gone:—the day grows still. Hold you, Hephestion, A favourite 'mid the flowers? Heph. Princess, in this The oft-erring public vote I deem not erring. You have heard the legend of the Flowers' Debate. The Rose advanced her claim: “Love's flower am I! The nightingale loves more my fragrant breast Than his own feather'd mate.” The Lily next, “The flower of Purity am I: young maids Boast me their snowy standard.” At the word, The Rose put forth her first white bud, and wears Since then the double crown. Ars. I like that legend: Who made it? Heph. I—unless you made it, princess: My eyes were on you when the thought descended. Ars. Hephestion, I have not forgot my promise; This rose-bud take; 'tis white. Could rose-buds live As long as grateful thoughts, or were they loved Their freshness past, 'twould help you to remember In hours to come, what else you might forget, Kindness in prison'd days to burthen'd hearts, Kindness to helpless womanhood, sad old age, Childhood—or what was childhood till our woes Had changed young hearts to serious. I must go: By this time our sweet mother will expect me. For his sake whom you love, your king, your friend, Jest not with dangers in the wars before you. Heph. Princess, for me this flower will keep its freshness. Scene VI.—Gate of the Temple of Jerusalem. Ptolemy, with a squadron of Thessalian Horse, which passes on. Ptol. Till he returns, this fig-tree be my shade! [Alone. He's right, and yet he's wrong, you kingly builder. That kingdom which he spake of—one o'er earth— Would prove a god-like work indeed if built Upon the good alone within man's breast, If on its ill, then ill were lord of all, Since in all lands the ill-workers would be one, Weakened till now by realms and states at variance. But what shall sever 'twixt man's good and ill? Not power, it works with each by turn; not law, Law deals but with man's actions, not his heart; Not science, science rules but worlds of thought; Not art, 'tis a child's warble; not religion, Men fear the gods, but serve not less their lusts: The things without us are but casual to us: The things within us share our human taint. On something deeper in us than self-love, He who would lift mankind must build. That something No child of man has found, or e'er can find:— Therefore, like isle from sunless waters raised And fix'd where nothing was, that Power who made us, Who knows alone our spirit's depths, and sees Alone the eddies of the restless waters, Must raise some under realm, all adamant, There build—if he will build. Shall that be ever? I know not. He who made the world is strong: Yet miracle were that passing the dream Of prophet, priest, or bard. 'Tis still the old round: Realm wars on realm lest wrong should meet no scourge. This youth must plan; and pass. Scene VII.—Interior of the Temple. The Jewish High Priest, Alexander. High Priest. This is that scroll whereof I spake to thee; That Vision which the exiled prophet saw, Sitting in Susa, by Choaspes' flood: “In vision I beheld a Beast two-horn'd; Westward he push'd, and northward, and to south, Nor any stood before him, After that, Another, mightier portent, swifter far Rush'd from the west, o'er face of all the earth Which yet he touch'd not, flying upon wings; He smote against that Beast, and trod him down; Nor any might deliver. Then, a Voice There reach'd me from betwixt the river banks: ‘That Beast which thou beheldest is that king, Lord of the Median and the Persian realms: He that shall overcome him is the Greek.’” This is that Vision which our prophet saw. Alex. That Voice your prophet heard was Voice of God— (after musing) You will not wed my cause, and save your city? High Priest. We may not, and we will not. Alex. Yet you know Mine is the empire? High Priest. What is writ is writ. Alex. What was that sacrifice you offer'd late? The like I have not seen. High Priest. The shadow 'twas Of substance onward striding. Ask no more: We are prophet-people: ours the Hope: We are God's people, and we stand apart: The kings of the earth may speed us, or may rend; Know us they cannot. Alex. I too had a vision— I yield you credence, Priest. I have repented My first resolve, and fling it from me far: I tribute none demand, and in your city Challenge no rule. Your prophets spake in ancient days of me; Spake they in earlier days of Persian Cyrus? High Priest. By name, before his birth two hundred years: Hear thou God's Edict. “Cyrus is my shepherd: I hold his right hand, loosening at his feet The hearts of Monarchs. I will cut in twain The bars of iron and the brazen gates.” Alex. The Babylonian gates stood wide that night When back Euphrates shrank. High Priest (reading). “Be dry, ye rivers! In Babylon the desert beast shall hide; The dragon couch within her palaces; The bittern shriek above her shallow pools.” Young man, hold thou no hand to Babylon, For God hath judged her, lest thou share her plagues. Alex. Hers was the first of Empires, and the worst— (After a pause.) The day goes by; lead onward to the gates. O'er all the earth my empire shall be just, Godlike my rule. High Priest. Young man, beware! God's prophet Awards thee Persia's crown, but not the world's: He who wears that should be the Prince of Peace. Thy portion lies in bounds. Limit and Term Govern the world. Thou know'st the Voice was God's That spake. Two ways there are—between them choose. Alex. I shall not fail to meditate these twain; Then make election. High Priest. Pardon, royal sir, A little moment past your choice was made: 'Tis known above; and you one day will know it. You trust not God: the man you trust will fail you. Alex. What man? High Priest. Yourself. Alex. At least I trust none other. High Priest. My message is delivered: Sir, farewell! [High Priest departs. Ptolemy enters Alex. There sits unwonted wonder on your brow, My Ptolemy! Ptol. Sir, all men kneel to you,’ You but to one, and him a man unknown! When first that long and strange procession reach'd us I saw an earnest inquest in your eye, A pallor on your cheek. Alex. You err, my friend: I knelt, but not to one unseen till then. Three years gone by, three months, and twenty days, At noon I sat in Macedonian Dium, (Its witless sons acclaimed me as a god) Musing the fortunes of this Asian war Then but decreed. There fell on me a trance Filled with strange fear. Never save in that trance Have I known fear. Ptol. What saw you in it, sir? Alex. Things as they were. Ptol. No more? Alex. Yea, things beside: My captains grew ape-visaged, and chattering rush'd On errands all confused, while down the street, In the wide Agora, on the temple's steps, The concourse, shrunk to pigmies, scream'd and strove;— The tallest like a three years' child. Meanwhile, There where benignant plains had spread but late, Heaven-high there hung in the east a mount, firecrown'd, And ruin-flank'd—a mount which seemed a world Huger than man's. The pigmies and the apes Saw it and laughed. Ptol. 'Twas strange! Alex. It was not slumber: Parmenio and Philotas at my right, You, Ptolemy, at my left, witnessed and sware That from my session ta'en till, sunset nigh, The priesthood issued from the fane of Zeus I had not ceased from audience and command Though sterner than my wont. The trance was long, And, as it deepen'd, darkness closed around: Then from that darkness like a god this man Drew near, methought, that mitre on his brow, That gem-illumined breast-plate on his breast. He spake,—“Fear nought; the God I serve shall lay His hand upon thy head, and lead thee on Triumphant through the danger and the gloom.” This world is full of wonders, Ptolemy, Or else it were not world for man, since man Is marvellous most. Divulge this thing to none, Nor write it in thine annals of the war. Scene VIII.—The Causeway between Old Tyre and New Tyre. Hephestion, Craterus, Seleucus. Cra. We've waited for the king, and for a wind: The wind is ours at last. Sel. And in fit time The king, that's wafted still by fortunate winds. Alex. (arriving). The wind is fair, and all the gods are with us! Bear up, my Cypriot and Sidonian fleets; I've bought you with a price! cut well the seas, And as the sword into the scabbard glides, So rush into their harbours! The boarding ships, You're sure they lie beside our mole, Seleucus, And moor'd by chains, not ropes? Those Tyrian divers Will cut them else adrift. Sel. They tried it thrice, You baffled them. We're ready, sire. Heph. Lo, there! They drag their prisoners round yon city's walls— Each after each they bend them to the block;— They hurl their headless trunks into the flood! Sel. Hark to that shout! Alex. Our fleets have forced the harbours! Up with the engines and the storming-parties! I cross the right-hand galley with Admetus; You, Cœnus, with Lysander, cross the left. Forth with the landing-planks and scaling-ladders! On, on, and up! [Alexander is the first to mount the walls. Hamilcar (from the tower). Men of Phœnicia, still the heights are ours. Hurl on them sleet of fire! Hanno. 'Tis life or death! Alex. (striking him down). Then take thy death! Heph. And take, Hamilcar, thine! [His sword breaks; he closes with Hamilcar, and flings him from the right-hand tower into the sea. At the same moment Cœnus gains the left-hand tower. Alex. 'Tis won! They fly! Scene IX.—The Palace of New Tyre. The Tyrian King, Azelmicus, Asdrubal, Ithocles, Generals and Senators. The Ambassadors from Carthage. The King. I'm old for fight, but young enough to die: I'll wait them on my throne. Asd. Within the vaults 'Neath Melkart's fane, amid our heaps of treasure, Conceal him with those envoys from the west: And see they bear the Tyrian crown to Carthage; Old Tyre has done with it. A ceremony [Senators bear away the king and ambassadors. Remains or ere we die. Ith. The torch? 'Tis here. The palace of great Tyre shall house them never. [The Tyrians are driven in from all sides on the Palace, which bursts into flame. At this moment Alexander arrives. Asd. Tyrians, we fight for vengeance, not for life— Tyre ne'er forewent that solace. Ith. Vengeance! Vengeance! [The battle rages till the whole Tyrian garrison has been cut down. Alex. So perish sea-born Tyre that ruled the waters! She sinks, like yonder sun, in a sea all blood. At dawn with feast and military honours, We'll thank the just and promise-keeping gods Who have led us thus far forth on victory's way. Seleucus, see the priesthood dedicate Yonder in Melkart's fane that conquering engine Which shatter'd first yon wall. Ye sons of Greece! Your country thanks you: many a song of hers Will celebrate this deed! A spoil is yours Well earn'd. Three days we rest: the fourth for Egypt! ACT III. Scene I.—The Road to Rhagæ near the Caspian Gates. Parmenio and Philotas. Phi. You are a greater man, sir, than you know, And bear your honours meekly. Pray you pardon My sometimes halting reverence. Par. Here's a change! I have warned you oft to bate your perilous pride Saying, “My son be less.” Your whim is now To show all humbleness. Phi. I should be humble To one who for his master has a god: Unseen I heard the king expound his schemes, Hephestion mildly plausive. Par. Schemes! What schemes? Phi. Kneel, Hercules, and Dionysus tremble! Tremble, thou Caucasus that hid'st thy head In snows eterne! Our great stage-king has sworn To plant his buskin on thy wintry scalp! Par. What seeks the boy? Phi. From eastern Caucasus Two rivers rush, the Indus and the Oxus, One south, one north. He'd tie them, tail to tail, Like foxes caught, to test their strength and prowess; Next, on those heights he seeks some herb to enrich The Stagyrite's medicine shop: and, lastly, thence He'd o'er-gaze Scythia, which with proximate place Is honour'd in the order of his conquests. Par. Renounce great Persia for a realm of bears! I march with him no more! Phi. You shall not need: Besieging Tyre, he sent you to Damascus To seal up sacred balms, and perfume-phials, And inventory the wardrobe of Darius. In Egypt, you had no conspicuous place: Now, for like cause, the Caspian Gates you pass not, Ecbatana your charge. Upon his treasure He bids you sit like an old hen, and hatch it While he strides on to victory. Snows of age With what auspicious calm ye crown old heads, And hearts virile no more! Par. The king's a madman:— The worse for us! Free him from that conceit That he's a god, the man of men were he: Since Marathon we have seen none other like him. Phi. One-half his victories come but of his blindness, And noting not the hindrance. Par. At Granicus— But that was chance. At Issus he was greater: I set small store on Egypt or on Tyre: Next came Arbela. Half a million foes Melted like snow. To him Epaminondas Was as the wingless creature to the wing'd. Phi. I grant his greatness were his godship sane! But note his brow; 'tis Thought's least earthly temple: Then mark, beneath, that round, not human eye, Still glowing like a panther's! In his body No passion dwells; but all his mind is passion, Wild intellectual appetite and instinct That works without a law. Par. But half you know him. There is a zigzag lightning in his brain That flies in random flashes, yet not errs: His victories seem but chances:—link those chances, And under them a science you shall find, Though unauthentic, contraband, illicit, Yea, contumelious oft to laws of war. Fortune, that as a mistress smiles on others, Serves him as duty-bound: her blood is he, Born in the purple of her royalties. On me she frown'd long time: these mailèd fists Smote her on breast and brow for thirty years, From Athos westward to the Illyrian coasts, Ere yet she learn'd to love me. He too loves me! Though jealous of my fame. Phi. You dream, good father! A tent's small fissure and a moonless night Help'd me to better knowledge. Thus he spake: “Hephestion, till Arbela's fight I loved him: I know him now, poor shell of that he was, For baggage-tendence best.” Par. Blunderer and traitor! He placed me at Arbela, naked of friends, Amid unnumber'd foes. He lied, and lies! Phi. How far to India, father? Par. 'Tis earth's bound: Beyond is nothing save the rising sun. Phi. 'Tis the beginning of his last ambition. Phœbus Apollo, stand on guard! this youth Will take a leap into thy flaming chair; He'll clutch thee by the bright locks never shorn; Far forth o'er earth he'll cast thee, there to tend Once more Admetus' herds! I tell you, father, Three times that night I heard him boast his schemes; Heard, and not laugh'd. 'Twas Scythia, first; then India. Par. I reck not of his injuries to myself;— But shall a new Cambyses drown in sands The best and bravest army bred by Greece? Not so, Parmenio living! Phi. Other help Greece lacks this hour. The camp is full of murmurs; Vacant of aid. Par. Your drift? Phi. A word suffices: Better a man should perish than a people. Par. (after a long silence). The day grows chill. Phi. A hundred ways there are— Par. Hark! 'Tis the royal trumpet. Son, be patient: The gods are helpful. Phi. Pious hand is his That helps the helpful gods! Par. We've time before us: Likeliest, a thousand hidden dangers 'scaped, He'll dash his bark against some mountainous rock, And vanish in flat seas. And yet, it may be That growing years will tame him. Phi. It were needful: If ere that time he perish in his cups One man there lives on whom the whole Greek host Would fix its gaze. Par. His name? Phi. 'Twas once Parmenio:— The man from war to war the battle's king; The man who grudged no soldier drink or victual, Nor sold his life for nought; the man who now Holds in his charge an empire's treasure. Well! If you're sent back, you'll know I fabled not. Scene II.—At Rhagæ. Seleucus, Craterus, and Ptolemy. Sel. Too late! The hunted stag has ta'en the leap; His lair is cold. Cra. The king will storm at this: He's quicklier moved than once: I mark him changing: He wills not opposition to his will. Since first he breathed this Asian air of kingship Divinity of kings hath touch'd him much: First, in his blood it play'd, like other lusts: It mounted next to fancy's seat; and now, His eye usurping, purples all his world. Injury to kings he deems not injury only, But sacrilege. Sel. Craterus, I scorn your words, I say I scorn them! Ptolemy, our wisest, In sophist balance never weighs his king, Nor scans him from the critic's fancied height. Cra. A speculative man that knows not men, A man whose blood flows sweetly through his veins, Leaving at every point a sleepy pleasure That needs must overflow to all our race In vague, complacent kindness. All his thoughts In orbits as of planets curving go, And grasp, like them, blank space. Your minds majestic, Like Ptolemy's, are oft but stately triflers. Sel. Has the king faults? So be it! He can afford them. Scene III.—Rhagæ. Alexander attended by Parmenio, Hephestion, and other Generals, and surrounded by soldiers. Alex. Darius is fled forth. I have chased a shadow: He'll raise new hosts; and I from realm to realm, From year to year must hunt him. Lords, three days Here we make rest perforce. Thus much, Parmenio, You cost me at Arbela! Par. Gods of Greece! Hear ye this man? My hand it was, my hand, Raised from the dust your late-crown'd Macedon: And lo! this day the heir of all this greatness Upbraids me as a boy! Alex. I said, and say it: Arbela all but won, to prop your squadrons You call'd me back: Darius made escape: I saw his chariot sink beneath the hills Lit by the last gleam of a sun that set; Let him that dares deny it. Par. I deny it! My best and bravest from my squadrons drain'd, Me with a trivial force your blindness placed 'Mid countless foes. With less consummate skill Than mine that hour your whole left wing had perish'd. In wrath, not fear, I warn'd you of your error: You saw it, and you made retreat aghast: Ere you had reach'd us the Thessalian horse With fortunate charge piercing the Persian ranks Had given us air to breathe. You spurn'd my counsel, Or earlier than Arbela's fight began Had come its glorious ending. Alex. Aye! your counsel! You will'd me to attack the foe by night: I answer'd that I steal not victory: The craven craft trips in the cloak that hides it And falls to the earth. With slender force like mine The worst defeat were victory incomplete:— This Persian foe is as a mist that melts, Re-forms, and swells against me. Oh, your counsels! I scorn'd them from the first, or foot of mine Had trod not Persian soil. Par. Shade of dead Philip! Make answer in my name! Alex. You counsell'd me Beside Granicus, not to cross the stream: At Ephesus—by auguries back'd, and omens That deepliest dint the craziest brain—you counsell'd To fight by sea, not land, the Persian fleet My ships exceeding fourfold, and with theirs Phœnicia's mated. Issus won, you counsell'd Naked to leave the Asian coasts, their prey Their appanage, who, sailing from safe ports Had raised revolted Greece from north to south And barr'd me from return. Par. This too I counsell'd— Omit not from that inventory of sins So diligently register'd, my greatest— To dash the red torch from a wanton's hand; Flameless to leave royal Persepolis, And shame the drunken revel! Alex. Hoary dotard! Darest thou remind me of that sole offence Which spots my sun-like fame? All-reverend mocker, At whose false breath dead bones of seeming truth In blasphemy are flesh'd, of shames thou speakest! One shame there rests—not merited—not mine— On me and Greece! I spared to file my tongue With thy transgression till this hour. Damascus Madden'd, beholding from her centuried throne The unutterable, obscene, impious act, When they whom thou hadst bribed to sell their trust, A long procession, from her gates advanced, Their treasure in the midst, unarm'd, unfearing, Old nobles, women, gown'd defenceless priests, And thou, the fool-led pupil of that son Whose boyish babble tunes thy senile drivel, Perfidiously didst on them launch thy power, And in their own blood drown. Par. It is a lie! The impeachment is a lie; the man a liar! That deed I wrought not, and I knew not of it: In the rear I rode. Captains of Macedon, Your ears have heard. I brand him for a liar! Your king has lied, and lies! Alex. Caitiff and coward! The grey hair—well thou know'st it—saves that head Which else this sword had from thy shoulders swept. I am requited justly who, unjustly In glorious offices above thy peers Stayed thee so long, for those high tasks unmeet Which by Hephestion or by Ptolemy, In silence were vicariously discharged. I strip thee of all functions to the last:— Take from him chain and sword! [After a pause. I stand rebuked; And, gazing on your countenances, lords, Remember that the ruins of a man Have in them ruin's claims. The man who smote his king upon the face, Who on his forehead nail'd the name of lie, Shall live, but not beside him, and not near, Honours shall keep, but sway no battle field, Back to Ecbatana! Get thee hence, Parmenio! And guard its citadel with Harpalus, A pardon'd man like thee. My purpose stood Thou thence shouldst join us with our Thracian aids: It shall not be; for I distrust thy sword, Though one time sharp; distrust, detest thy counsel, Yet trust thy faithfulness to guard my gold And keep my Median capital in awe. Depart: work waits. Thy son shall take no hurt From his sire's fall. On earth we meet no more. Par. King—for that pride which maddens, and will wreck you, Demands such lessening titles—I depart. I too, like you, have mused, and changed my purpose: That which it was, and is, let no man ask. This is the ending of a life-long league. I laid my strong sword by your cradle's side; I taught you how to walk, and how to run, To ride, to swim; and when you sought to fly I bade you to beware. Could all this thing be painted, patch'd, adjusted, Reduced to spleen of fancy, proven a dream, This day from out the starry count of time Be blotted, cancell'd, buried, and trod out, I'd not so have it, for my heart is changed. My head, you say, through age hath lost its cunning; My heart hath insight still: I see your end: I'll whisper it to Philip in the shades, For I shall see him soon. You shall succeed, and your success be ruin: You shall achieve a name: in after years The byeword it shall live of madness crown'd: By night the dagger, and the spear by day From you shall glance: snow-wastes and burning sands To you obsequious, shall but choke the just: Yet all your greatness shall be changed to bane: Your virtues shall not walk in Virtue's ways, But glorify your vices, and the beam Of your bright mind blacken that mind to madness: The empire you shall build in cloudy wreck Shall melt around your deathbed premature, Which shall not be a warrior's: that first realm, Your father's work and mine, to dust shall fall; The Royal House evanish as a wind, Your mother, and your sisters, sons, and wife, Alexander's whole family was thus cut off. His wife, Arsinoe, and her sister Drypetis, the wife of Hephestion, were treacherously invited to Babylon, and there murdered by Roxana (the beautiful daughter of the Bactrian, Oxyartes), whom Alexander had married immediately after capturing her and her father during his march through Sogdiana. Roxana herself was put to death by order of Cassander, together with Alexander's son by her, then sixteen years of age, who bore his father's name. Hercules, the son of Alexander by Barsine, was murdered by Polysperchon at the instigation of Cassander. Yet more tragic was the fate of that wonderful woman, Alexander's mother, Olympias. Cassander had never forgotten the persistent enmity of Olympias to his father, Antipater. The day of his triumph came at last. He entered Macedonia, and after various vicissitudes of fortune, Olympias was obliged to take refuge in Pydna, with a large number of royal and noble persons attached to her court. The siege of Pydna was long and terrible; but the horrors of plague and of famine became at last unendurable; Olympias found herself deserted by her army, and Macedonia was in the hands of Cassander. At his instance the kinsmen of those whom Olympias had put to death in her hour of triumph accused her in a general assembly. There were none to plead her cause, and she was condemned to death. The aged queen was equal to the occasion. She clothed herself in her royal robes, and leaning on two of her women, came with a haughty mien to meet the party of soldiers which had been sent to despatch her. They stood before her helpless, overcome by the majesty of her aspect, and the great recollections connected with her name. Cassander then sent her accusers to be her executioners. The end is thus related by the historian Justin: ‘They slew her as she stood, not shrinking from sword, or wounds, nor clamouring aloud in womanly fashion, but meeting her death in a manner becoming her great race, so that in his dying mother Alexander might still be seen. In death she wrapped her person round in her robes, and covered her face with her hair, that nothing might attend her close inconsistent with the royal dignity.’ Struck down successive by a vassal hand In bloody, base, and ignominious death. Lords, give ye way. Some blood-drops in my brain At times make dim mine eyes; but help I need not. Who's this? Hephestion? Tell my son, Philotas, That after-musings on this morn's discourse Have somewhat changed my sentence. Home, they say, Is best for age. I seek it. Eighty years I have made my home on horseback. Sirs, farewell. [Parmenio departs. Alex. To business! We have heard of clamours late From men with homeward cravings. Let them know That, though their service-time is unexpired, We grant them to depart, nor that alone, But praised of him they served. We give the horse Two thousand talents: to the rest we grant For every man the tenth part of a talent, Their pay continuing till they set their feet On Grecian shores. Ant. We're weak without the horsemen. Alex. Or with them, or without them, we are weak; But these, with glory gladden'd and with gain, Where'er they move—and wealth will make them restless— Shall noise our name, and send our camp recruits For each man lost, a score. To Grecian horsemen Electing to abide we give three talents, Foot-soldiers in proportion. Epocillus Escorts them to the coast, and Menes thence Shall steer them to Eubœa. Macedonians Are free not less. [A shout. We bide! There's none will go. Alex. So be it! The satrapy of conquer'd Media On Oxodates we confer, a Mede, But one by King Darius wrong'd—thence safe; With him, for military government, Joining Tlepomenus of Macedon. The garrison at Ecbatana late left, And with it three battalions of the Phalanx, By Cleitus led, will make us soon forget Those fissures in our ranks. Lords, fare ye well! On the fourth morn once more we chase Darius: I have heard that he has traitors in his ranks: No friends are they of mine. Scene IV.—The Persian Camp. Darius lies on the ground, bleeding. A Greek soldier gives him water to drink from his helmet. Dar. Sir, you have stain'd, I fear, your scarf. I thank you For this good office. Kings should have more than thanks For friendly service. Bessus and his knaves Have fled before your face. Sol. Ye gods! Ye gods! Dar. My friends have been my foes; a foe my friend:— Likewise your king show'd reverence to my mother: Tell him I stretch'd to him my hand in death. Persia, farewell! [Dies. Alexander arrives with Hephestion, Eumenes, and Philotas. Sol. Behold the Persian king! Alex. (after long silence). If that reproof had lodged upon thy brow, Or any sneer had curl'd that quiet lip, I could have brook'd it better. See, Hephestion, How humble he doth look, and unupbraiding; How charitable, peaceful, and content! What hath he found? An empire he hath lost, And lo, he smiles in death! Remove that cloak: Lo, there the wounds through which his life-blood rush'd— The blood of Cyrus! Traitors foul and fell! King, he that caused thy death strove yet to save thee: Me too those sacrilegious daggers struck, My fame and me, through that deep-trenchèd breast: I'll slay them on thy grave. Phi. 'Twas true! Darius Of Persia's sons was comeliest. Eum. Of her daughters They say his queen was fairest. Issus lost, How soon she slept in death! Heph. Alas, Arsinoe! Alex. (removing his own mantle). Take, crownless monarch, take, insensate clay, From whom thine empire like a vesture slid, This mantle immemorial of my house; Wear it as thou had'st conquer'd Macedon, Yea, wear it in thy grave. The king is dead. The royal obsequies By ancient use are his successor's care: I'll have his body to his mother borne With ceremonial of the Persian wont, With Magian death-dirge, and procession long, The silver altars moving at his head, The Sacred Fire ascending; in the rear Those mystic youths that emblem night and day, Three hundred, and three score, and five. A sun For ever rising, o'er the bier shall shine, Persia's high pledge of immortality. Thus to the burial-place of eastern kings Darius shall be borne, and with them sleep. Why stand ye silent, lords? Battle is battle, Kings too must die. To Hecatompylus! Hephestion, move we on. This thing is ill: But who of men is greater than the Fates? Less than my empire what is mine I'd give. To undo this deed. This deed, though not undone, Another deed shall expiate. Till that hour I must forget him. Scene V.—The Southern Shore of the Caspian. Ptolemy, Seleucus, Craterus, Antigonus, Cassander. Cra. Hyrcania's bears are her best citizens; Their borrow'd coats protect us from her storms Intolerable else. Cas. Her mountains pass'd, All else looks gentle, even those hurrying waves Spray-dimm'd and whitening 'neath the hustling gale, And the vapours Fury-like along them scudding. Ptol. I hate not mountains when they keep their distance; When near, they're vile—crazed Nature's bombast vein, Or worse, her Delphic vein, suggesting meanings Which or she cannot or she will not speak, Yearnings unutterable, at least unutter'd, Vexatious and disquieting. The edge Of yonder cliff is like a Memnon's head, Seen sideways. Alex. (arriving with Heph.) 'Tis more like Darius' mother As once I saw her, gazing on dark skies An hour and more unmoving. Heph. Craterus, mark, In the purple glens those wandering isles of light! Down each green vale a tempest sweeps, and bears A rainbow smoke that cannot make a rainbow, Still, as the promontory's gate is reach'd, Blown loose in the misty air! Sel. How fresh and biting The odour from the weeds on yonder shelf, Sway'd by the brine! No foot of man till now Printed these sands! Alex. What! soldiers turn'd to poets! Fancy is best when imping action's wings:— Forth with your fancies, then! Were gods your slaves, What fortunes would ye choose? Speak one and all! Ptolemy, Seleucus, Antigonus, and Cassander, cry aloud together— A kingdom! Alex. Why, an empire costs no more! I'd rather be a hunter on the hills Than wall'd by one small, limitable kingdom! The gods you serve have thrift. Note this Hephestion, Imagination is economist, And vastest ends move less its appetite Than small things near and easier of acquest. Say, next, what kingdoms choose ye? Ptol. Give me Egypt; 'Tis much in little with its fruitful Nile. Sel. Syria for me: I grant it desert-cumber'd: Aye, but 'tis ample! Anti. Mine be Lesser Asia! 'Tis Greece grown softer—maid to matron changed, Asperities subdued—a mould benigner, A grace less saucy, but a richer smile. The round green mountains are as thrones of gods: The white fane glances far o'er violet seas: The sands are golden ore: there wealth and wit Have made a pleasant sort of random bridal. I'll build my house on Taurus' slopes that look To Aphrodite's isle. Cas. For me the old land, Our Macedon and Thrace! The climate's rough; The hearts are sound. Alex. Fair kingdoms, lords, I wish you, Albeit not those. A future too have I: Dubious it is, yet bright. See ye yon clouds, The near, and those beyond snow-white and still Which gaze on us from some austerer world, Thronging like phantom kings, with ice-cold crown? These nearer clouds are like my daily battles Wherein I ever triumph; those remote, And minatory more, are fates not fortunes, That bide their time. For fortunes and for fates I stand alike prepared. What mean those horsemen? Forth, sirs, and meet them: Craterus, abide, Hephestion likewise. [The rest depart. These desire a kingdom, Yet these are they that most with jealous eye Mislike my royal leanings. They misdeem them: The empire I desired was military, And naked as the statues of the gods, Not ceremonious, Persian, gilt with pomps Like that which now draws near. I saw it coming, and I waved it from me; I march'd to Egypt; I deferred the time; But these, my fates, are closing gradually round, Nor am I wont to fly. Asian and Greek Henceforth must be as one. I know my people: They'll say, “Shall Persia, now a dotard grown, By help of Greece have lordship over Greece That scourged her in her prime?” I answer thus, I came to rule a world, and not to make one; My empire is of men. Heph. Sir, Greek is Greek: The Greek will feast with Persian or with Mede, Will pray with Syrian, or with Bactrian dance, But equall'd in the ranks of war he'll march With Greek alone. Alex. 'Tis not this Persia only:— Assyria, Babylonia, Susiana, Armenia, Media,—this we learn but late! Greece is to these but as a drop to ocean; She yields me but a handful of recruits: I stand confuted by each conquest new, Soon won, but kept at cost: horizons fresh Outface me still with kingdom beyond kingdom. To overrun a world, and then forsake it— That means but glory: I demand an empire. Heph. With time your strength— Alex. No friend of mine is Time; I have to build an empire in few years: My armies must be Greek at once, and Persian: Persia that sees in me a conqueror now, Must find in me her king. How win her love? The vanquish'd must connive, or victory's self Digs its own grave in the end. Abuses old I with far-reaching and vindictive hand Drag from their pride of place. Barbaric hordes, With whom the Persian traffick'd, I hunt down For easing of the poor, that so their tribute Be paid in steel, not gold. Yet Artabazus, The faithfullest to Darius while he lived, To me now faithful for his country's sake, Still whispers, “Wouldst thou win the Persian's love? Win first his awe.” Never was Persian yet Who, empire plain before him, could discern it, Though proved by gifts, or patent in destructions, Without the obeisance, pageants, adorations That stamp the man a God. [The generals return. Eum. (holding up a letter). From Artabazus. Alex. (reading). “Bessus, but late a traitor fugitive, More late hath donn'd the Persian diadem, Assumed the sacred name of Artaxerxes, And, claiming kinship with the royal house, Stands up a king. The Bactrians join his hosts.” So! I foresaw it! Said I not, Hephestion, He that would rule them through the sense must rule, Must walk apparell'd in their customed pomps And rituals of their throne? Heph. I fear 'tis true. Alex. You fear: I laugh: they're not so all unlike us: The Greek is proud of self, and, self abated, Stands gall'd: the Persian's pride is in his king, And, stinted of his trappings, starves in the cold: In either country greatness wears the buskin, Plays now his part, who, being great, appears such, Now his, the man's that's greater than he seems— With worm-like scruples, and with bat-like doubts I have traffick'd all too long. A Messenger (entering). From Greece a missive. Alex. (reading). Antipater writes thus: “Keenwitted Greece Grudges no triumph that allures you eastward Imperilling your return. Sparta, but now, Close-linked with Thrace, at Megalopolis Launched twenty thousand men. I march'd to meet her: Our victory bled us badly.”—Battles of flies! Here's more: “Expect not plentiful recruits; Revolt has left us few.” Eum. Will leave him fewer. Alex. I thank thee, Zeus! My path is plain henceforward! Send edicts, Eumenes, to my eastern realms: Bid them to lodge their youths, the best and noblest, Straightway in schools where they shall learn at once Greek arms, Greek letters. These, their training perfect, We with our Phalanx will incorporate, Distinctions, save of merit, knowing none. Command them that they gird me in three years With thirty thousand such. Write, and at once. Scene VI.—The mountains in Aria. Philotas, Antisthenes the sophist, Phylax the physician. Phi. How the cold bites! When sets the sun, Death's hood Descends on yonder snows. Antisthenes, You sup with me. O'er twenty leagues in Media My hunters spread their nets that I might dine While fish from Persia gamboll'd in my tanks: Now fare we as we may. Ant. I'll trust your luck: The king, because his soldiers' bread is black, Devours hard crusts himself. Phy. Great Esculapius! Who sinn'd this time? What drags this idiot hither? Phi. You know not! Aristotle, his sage master, In every science train'd him, one except: He's come abroad to learn geography! Ant. I suffer'd less tracking Egyptian sands To Ammon's fane—his father's. Phy. I feigned sickness And cheated Ammon! Still I pitch my tent With those keen heads that see in earth and heaven The unalarming reign of Matter only, Midway their flowery haunt unvex'd by gods, And, peacefuller yet, the innocuous bourn of Nought. Religions mean but priestcraft. Ant. Cobwebs! Rend them! Phi. I tell you, no! men must have gods to swear by. Ant. Here are three atheists; and the worst are you. Phy. Yea, thrice the worst! Phi. I stand by law and order; We cannot live without our “Ho!” and “Ha!” Religion is a nation's interjection: Let statesmen look to that! Phy. Statesmen may pass: They have this merit—that they war on priests: Impartial science loathes them both alike, Will strangle both—unless they slay each other: But here, a priest and statesman, roll'd in one, Grows to a god. Oh, to have heard that whisper From Ammon's shrine! Phi. The king divulged it not: He's great in silence. Ant. There was heard a rumour— It died by slow degrees, but now revives— That Zeus, at Ammon served in serpent form, Is father of this king. Phy. A priestly lie! I have track'd it to its den. The Mænad women, When spring bewitches earth snow-crusted still And the last frosts resist yet yield to sunshine, Partake the madness of that mother old; Then, raging on the Thyrsus-smitten hills, O'er Thrace they roam, and hymn their Dionysus, That god whose altar 'neath the Athenian rock Sends up its smoke while round it on the stage The moon-struck chorus dancing hurls its chaunt, And the Æschylean tragedy, with tales Of king-bewildering Passion crown'd by Fate, Freezes men's hearts. Thus raging, fancies black, Audacities of nature unfulfill'd Inbreathed through those that would be more than nature, Earth-fires, that mock the lightning of the heavens, Assail them. Poison-flowers they suck unscathed, And from the serpent rive his poison-fangs Amorous of pain, spleenful not less to inflict it, Boastful to sport with death! With these Olympias, In her fierce youth, unwed but marriageable, Walk'd in her pride, and learn'd their arts: more late At Samothracia's Mysteries met with Philip, They loved, and wed. In wedlock's stormy dawn, At times for sport, at times to flout her lord, She tamed a snake, and now for crown would wear it, Now for her zone. The legend thence arose Of Zeus, a serpent. Ant. Each man is a poet In his own art. Beneath your pestle, Phylax, A fire-eyed Muse leaps up! Phy. I track'd the tale— Ant. Which Alexander fathers not, but fosters: His pride still grows. Phi. Meantime his Persian pomps Sharpen Greek daggers. Thus much Dimnus whispers. Ant. Likewise his anger-fits: the royal pages Taste these the oftenest. Hermolaus, late, While the king rush'd—they hunted—on a boar, Flinging a javelin graceless but well aim'd, Laid the beast dead. The king gave word to scourge him: This youth has vowed revenge, albeit the wrong Is little noised. But hush! He comes; say nought; He needs no whetting. [Hermolaus joins them. Phi. Gentle Hermolaus, This heinous outrage, dinn'd through camp and court, Deplored by all, to me is worse than grievous: I knew your father. Silence friends that prate! Shames to great houses, bruited once, live long, In Macedon long; longer in garrulous Greece. Antisthenes, be true to time, and with you Bring Hermolaus. Keep me sound, good Phylax! I swim in glories, pleasures, golden fortunes: One peccant nerve in all this frame ajar, What were all these? We've quails—I think—for supper. Scene VII.—Alexander's Tent on the Jaxartes. Alexander and Craterus. Alex. That's shout the third: whatmoves their rage? Cra. Philotas Should answer that: he's masterful in gibes: The soldiers say that once, to spite a woman, He kiss'd a viper's mouth: the viper died. He's venom-tongued, and mischievous more for this— He holds his sneers for truths. Alex. In Egypt first I learn'd his malice. For his father's sake I will'd not his disgrace, and so advanced him: The man's not won. Cra. He scorns your Persian pomps; Scoffs at that legend of your birth divine: There are who swear that in the Ammonian fane You learn'd the secret. Alex. This was what I learn'd, That earth is mine to rule. The legend's little; Baseless 'tis not, nor now unseasonable. Whence comes the soul? We know not. What if souls Heroic, from the great heart of some god Forth-flashing as a beam from sun or star, Blend, thus detach'd, with soul-expectant frames Worthiest such mate, and stamp the demi-god, While meaner souls float blind down streams Lethean? Cra. All men are children of the Power Divine. Alex. All men, I grant, win a creative touch From hand divine. The hand is not the heart! If heroes issue from the heart of gods As from the head of Zeus Athenè sprang, I say they are sons of gods. If here on earth We grant a father's god-like name to those Who generate these our earthly bulks, why then Grudge to our spirits' sire a father's title? This is that truth which, in its mean disguise, My soldiers recognize. Cra. Philotas saith 'Tis base to kneel before the sceptred hand. Alex. Because himself is base. This is the baseness— To quick or dead, the sceptred or unsceptred, To yield the meed of worship not deserved: From them that have deserved it to withhold it Is theft, and may be sacrilege. Who comes? [Hephestion and Perdiccas enter hurriedly. Per. Dimnus, a known conspirator, and proven— Alex. I heard it three hours since. Heph. Dimnus is dead: He sware that, living, they should take him never. Alex. I like not that. Per. Philotas schemed the plot. Alex. I saw Philotas; charged him with his crime. He knelt; he wept; protested innocence; Had deem'd the rumour but an empty tale: I sent him forth absolved. Per. This letter cancels That absolution. Sir, 'tis from Parmenio; He weighs the plot; approves it; urges caution Which, wed with valour, breeds alone success: We found it 'mid the traitor's papers. Read! Alex. (after reading). What is it that you demand? Per. This man, Philotas, By you from dust uplifted to the heights, This man who might have flown, by preference blind And native instinct, creeping through base life, Hath, like the worm that slimes his path, made vile The paths he crawl'd upon. This man of old Walk'd with Amyntas, him that, Philip dead, Schemed for your throne. This man, three days or more— He not denies it—cognizant of the plot, Held him in silence till the hour itself Of butchery decreed. You ask, what claim we? Sir, this your army claims—the right to live: This plot is neither plot the first, nor second; And we are here to warn you that your host Which oft for wanton risking of his life Hath censured its great chief, this day condemns him As one who, set apart and seal'd by gods, Perils his army, and his empire perils, Yea, with conspirators himself conspires, Boy-like to boast great heart. Alex. Their fears are vain: On my last field, grey-headed, I shall die, Circled by subject kings. What seek my soldiers? Per. They make two claims; first, that the great Assembly Should sift and judge the crime; next, that the award, Once pass'd, should take effect without appeal. Alex. (after musing). We grant them both demands. Call in those Indians. Scene VIII.—On the Jaxartes. Philotas in prison, and Phylax. Phi. You've let me blood full oft—cured many a headache: The king with sharper steel than yours, old friend, Will cure to-day's. The surfeit long of life Ceases at set of sun. Can'st cure my heartache? Phy. 'Tis vengeance you demand? Phi. You have read my soul That, sitting in mine eyes and all ways turning To watch those dreadful ministers of fate, Sees something still behind. 'Twould sweeten death! Phy. One day I vowed to avenge you. Phi. Can I trust you? They say the mirthful nature does not love: And yet I think I somewhat loved you, Phylax: No hypocrite were you. I knew that much. Phy. You'd have me kill this king? Phi. Not him—Hephestion! 'Tis there he's vulnerable. Be it done When the Alexandrian star is at its highest. That too will set. Phy. I have pledged my faith. Phi. Remember! An ice-film gathers on my shivering blood. Oh happy days of youth! They'll laugh at me A shadow 'mid the shades, as I have laugh'd At Homer's ghosts bending to victim blood A sieve-like throat incapable of joy! Tell me these things are fables. I'd not live A second time; for life's too dangerous! We come from nothing; and another nothing, A hoary Hunger, couchant at Death's gate, Waits to devour us. Phy. (Placing his hand on the heart of Philotas). Slowly, faintly, slowly :— The failure's there. Phi. Murderers! The law's against them For if I knew that plot, or if I will'd it, I spared to join it. Murderers!—lawless murderers! I tripped an inch at this side Fortune's goal: Parmenio king, his successor were I. Phy. Their plea is equity—the culprit's plea Then when his law-plea fails. Phi. Is that a jibe? He needs must jeer and gibber!—Vengeance! Vengeance! Happy the serpent that with death for death Enriches its last pang! Olympias only Escaped its tooth. Once more I laugh! Forget not— I've left you in my will a hundred talents. Ah, hark! a step— Scene IX.—A Hill close to the Jaxartes. Alexander, Hephestion, Eumenes. Heph. Beyond that infinite, pale, grassy plain Rise those white peaks like pyramids o'er sands: Is this your northern limit? Alex. Scythia's horse Watch still their chance. They are no way barbarous: I guess them at twelve thousand. Stealthily, In ever widening gyres they near the bank, Poor gilded swarmers in their warmthless sun:— I have baulked their game. Resume we our dispute! What if the race of gods began with men? If nature, evermore through strife educing Stronger from strong, throned on Olympus, first The heroic-proved of men as demi-gods, And these through strife worked out the gods that rule? Concede me this as true, and man's ambition May kindred claim with gods. Heph. Concede it! never. Greatness, be sure, came never from below: That thought would drag from heaven itself its greatness: Rather the gods themselves make manifest One higher still than they. Sir, there are whispers, trust me, from beneath— These should be trampled and not parleyed with: Esteem such thoughts among them. Alex. This, that's great My thought suggests; an infinite progression. Heph. Nay, but a finite mocking infinite And murdering what it mocks:—the highest term In such a series but repeats the first Exaggerating still inherent flaws, And in a nakeder shape, though vaster scale, Showing man's nature shamed. Alex. The gods have passions, Not minds alone: in this they are like to men. Heph. They act like men who have them:—that proves little: Our ignorance doubtless misconceives their acts: 'Twas not Apollo's spite that sentenced Marsyas: Twas no earth-instinct on Endymion smiled: The self-same acts, in gods, in men, in beasts, Know difference large. Acts lawful in the man Are crimes in boys. Alex. A race of gods hath fallen: Then Zeus in turn may fall. I find no thrones Whereon the gods themselves may sit secure: I find to man's advance no term or limit; No certain truth amid contending rites; No base for Faith. Heph. Then man must live by Hope. Alex. And whence our hope? Heph. From all things good around us, From all things fair—the brightness of the world, The glory of its rivers and its seas, The music in the wandering of its winds, The magic in the spring-flowers fresh accost, The gladdening sweetness and pure grace of woman, The questioning eyes of childhood. With one voice They preach one hope—that virtue shall be crowned One day, and Truth be known. Alex. The trumpet! Hark! We Greeks must wrangle on in the battle's mouth! Six kingdoms have I clutched within two years; The seventh shall be the greatest. Ant. (entering). Tidings, sire! The Satrap of Aria yields submission. [Perdiccas and Craterus enter. Alex. The Satrap keeps his office. Craterus, speak: The Assembly of the Army, hath it judged? Cra. The court was faithful to procedure's law, And, spite the wrathful host that stormed around, Pronounced not judgment till Philotas, first Heard in his own defence, but after, tortured, Had made confession full, his proper guilt, The crime of Dimnus and of Hermolaus, His sire's complicity. The traitor pushed Before its time the plot, though hatched by others, Lest he who guards your treasure-house far off Might drop ere all was ripe. The High Tribunal Proceeded to the award—death to Philotas, Death to Parmenio, and the rest. The host Raged in its joy; so oft his pride had galled them; So often had they gaped on frosty roads While passed his baggage train. His sister's husband Raised the first stone. Alex. How died he? Cra. Ill enough. Per. A traitor died this day. Cra. A traitor proved. Alex. A man whose death was needful died this day; Likewise a man whose guilt was probable Well-nigh to certainty—but yet not certain, Since cowards, tortured, may confess things false. Philotas or conspired or else connived, And each of these is capital, or changed From keen to dullard in a sort that's death In nature's capital code. I, in his place, Had ta'en small umbrage at my days abridged: There lived nor scope nor purpose in his life Which death could mar. Cra. For instant doom they clamoured, Fearing your leniency— Alex. I am not lenient: When prodigal I have seemed, and lax in pardons, 'Twas with a politic aim. Nor am I cruel: For needful warning I have shed man's blood, Full often to the bound extreme of justice, Seldom beyond. I say not that the bound In wrath or peril never was transgressed. It was no will of mine to try this man: But, judged and sentenced, never had I spared him Certain thenceforward in my blood to seek, Likeliest at some high crisis of my empire, Ablution for his name. Lo, there! They launch A flag of truce. Ptol. (arriving). The Scythians send us envoys. With proffer of firm peace. Their terms are these: North of the river their old hunting-grounds Remain their own: this granted, they, in turn, Acknowledge, sire, for yours, the manifold realms From that wide water to the mountain bound And limitless beyond to the Indian deep, Thenceforth your sworn allies. Alex. Their terms are just; Accept them, and engross. Those Indian Heralds— Ant. (entering). That murderer, Satabarzanes, is slain; And Spitamenes, honouring his own head, Surrenders Bessus. Alex. Let the self-same court That judged Philotas judge this bloodier traitor; When sentenced, be he sent to Sysigambis, The dead king's mother: her award is mine. Alas for old Parmenio! Heph. Bid him live! Alex. His guilt is mixed and tangled with that other's: The father spared, the son had foully died. Heph. The time to come— Alex. As ignorantly on this, And in its ignorance as confidently, Shall pass its judgment as on things beside: Its plaudits I shall have for things ill done: Its censure for the needful and the just: Too much, no doubt, of both. Heph. Slay not Parmenio! Alex. Shall I for propping of a flag-staff bent Trouble a half-raised empire's base? Hephestion Save that I know thee in the battle-field Except myself the foremost, there are times When I could deem thee weakling. To your tasks, Friends, one and all. [The Generals depart. Hephestion's cause is stronger than he knows: Parmenio's death will much offend the army; Their panic quenched, their loves will back to him: Yet he must die. He'll hear of his son's death Ere my best speed could reach Ecbatana: The troops around him there are as his children, And, with the imperial treasury at his beck, Nations will be his friends. Parmenio's death will much offend the army, Bound by old memories more to him than me: New wars will aptliest teach it to forget— To India then! Thus stands my doubt resolved! To that through all this tanglement I leant, Yet knew it not till now. Yon priest at Hierosolyma forbade it— 'Tis strange how oft that man before me stands— Spake much of “Term and Limit.” That's for others: To grasp a world for me is feasible; To keep a half-world, not. Scene X.—Susa. The Cypress Cemetery. Arsinoe, Amastris. Ama. Return ere long, my gentle litter-bearers— How cool this cypress shade! how fair this spot So soon to be my grave! Chide not, Arsinoe; I would not die; I would not be unhappy: I would live blest, and making blest. Ah me! I think, I think that I was gathering strength Till came those tidings from Arbela's field Of my brave brothers dead. Others I loved: I loved but these in hope. Ars. Hope still, my cousin: Hope more! The day that lifts you from these arms Will give you back your brothers! Ama. I have hope, Though scarce like yours. Oh for a strong-winged hope, Swan-like to soar, lighting that dim domain Eclipsed by death's cold shade! I loved the Songs: Am I ungrateful if at times I feel Like one that trusts and has not found? Ars. Beloved, Things greater than the things we loved and found not One day shall find us. Let me see your book: 'Tis that you read in Tyre's old palace garden— Ama. The day we saw him last. Ars. Hephestion? Ama. Him: Your eyes grow large. Ars. That day you scarce were near us. Ama. His love wasfor the child and not the maiden: I left him with you then and many a time Before that morning. Cousin, here's a song: Read it; my eyes grow dim. Ars. It is of Cyrus. Ama. We'll not read that. Assyrians wept that day As we weep now: the Babylonian air Was thick with sobs: above Chaldæa's plain Like a great wind the orphans' cry rang out: The bards are less than generous. Ars. And for that cause Unjust. Here's one that's not a song of triumph. [Reads. Marriage Song. I Love begins upon the heights As on tree-tops in the spring April with green foot alights While the birds are carolling: Ay, but April ends with May: Love must have the marriage-day! II Love begins upon the heights As o'er snowy summits sail First the dewy matin lights Destined soon to reach the vale: Ay, but maidens must not grieve That morn of love hath noon and eve. III Love is Dream and Vision first: Proud young Love the earth disdains; But his cold streams, mountain-nursed, Warm them in the fruitful plains Ere the marriage-day is sped: Peal the bells! The bride is wed! Ama. If Love indeed begins upon the heights, 'Twere well he ended there. His starry feet Would thus their splendour best retain. It may be Maidens that, loving well, unwedded die, In this are happier yet than those who find Love's loveliest human home. Ars. I would not wed; And you have turned from many a suit—scarce gently. Ama. Arsinoe! you will wed, who would not wed; I die, who would not die. Our life's amiss! I must not say it:—no, our life is gentle: You'd rather live ill-matched than fail in duty; I'd rather die than prove to friendship false, Of love unworthy. Each will have her best. Ars. O friend, my earliest friend, my best! how much I owe to you! how hard had been without you! In the deep bosom of your boundless love I breathed a generous and a healing clime: In all our sorrows you, yourself an orphan, Out of your poverty for me had wealth, And pitied me so sweetly that perforce Self-pity left me, and I smiled through tears. You only lived in others. The Songs you loved Served you full well: they clothed your spirit with light: In them you bathed as in some wood-girt stream Crystalline ever. I, upon the bank, But felt the dew upon its breath, the drops Showered from your hand:—they cooled an aching forehead. Ama. Ah! ere we clothe us with that water-light, We drop the warm, protecting garb of earth! Who feigned the nymphs feigned them invulnerable By bitter north-wind, or the hunter's dart. My mother said the Songs would teach me sorrow— They taught me sorrow and joy; would leave me weak— They left me weak and strong. I lived in others; But you for others lived. Arsinoe, Should he return you'll lead him to this spot; You'll give him here this book of songs:—he knew it— Read him some few—not this, for he is blithesome, This song as plaintive as the voice of child Heard lonely from the harvest field afar When twilight wraps the land. Bordering the scroll Are golden stars, and little pictured fancies: Here is the mother-bird that feeds her brood From her own bleeding breast; and here's a young one That bends above the on-rushing stream, athirst, And yet afraid to drink:—the spray is bending:— Most are the work of others: one was mine, Ere yet this hand had learned its trick of shaking. If you should name my name, mark well his face So bright that day, and note if he remembers. Say that we spake of him—that I was happy In life—in death. You'll say not that I loved him. Give me one kiss. You're welcome, merry maidens, Albeit so soon returned. Set down my litter. ACT IV. Scene I.—Susa, in front of the Palace. Antigonus, Eumenes, Seleucus, Craterus, Peucestas, Amyntas, Phylax. Ant. At Susa once again! Why, this is Greece! One time it seemed the eastern edge of earth; Measured by that great space we have tracked, 'tis home. Eum. Six years ago we gazed on yonder palace: In three we conquered Asia's eastern half; India in three! Sel. India! once more I ee it, Once more I tread its palm-groves and its plains, I scan the red sun through the sandy mist, And hear the lion's roar. Our earlier conquests Were prelude notes—no more. Amy. I am late arrived: Recount the tale. Sel. 'Twas victory, day by day: 'Twas victory till, the appetite itself Satiate with triumphs, in our host remained Nought but the base uxorious homeward craving. The Indus and Hydaspes we had crossed, The Hydraotes and the Acecines; Then, as a gathering tide, or desert flame That nearer draws, was heard a deepening murmur And as on banks of Hyphasis we stood That murmur found a voice. The army sware To march no farther east. The king but smiled, And bade them make encampment, and take rest. Next day, at noon, he flung that strength of words, Upon them which till then they ne'er withstood, And, ceasing, looked around with eye ablaze. Then first I saw a wonder in that face: He gazed, and passed into his tent alone; There lonely sat three days. The silence 'twas Taught him the host's resolve. Amy. What held it silent? Sel. Fate, or the reverence of remorseful gods That knew their man. That Indian Seer at last Made good his way into the royal tent: What passed none knows. At eve the king gave word:— Ere long we sailed a-down Hydaspes' flood. Ant. Hydaspes never saw a sight like that! An army on each side, and, in the midst, Two thousand ships! Peu. Forests were felled to build them! The winds will miss their playmates many an age. The nations shivered that beheld our coming, Sibas, Ossadian, Sogdian, Sudracæ;— The Malli fought the best. Sel. The world's great scales Trembled that day! Our king—I see him still— By him three friends—a host of foes in front! 'Twas you that saved him! Peu. 'Twas that Argive shield In fortunate hour plucked from the Trojan fane. I held it high: it triumphed! Sel. Down we sailed To the ocean flood, and made our vows, and buried The sacrificial goblet in the wave. Next, month by month we tracked Gedrosian sands: The army of Semiramis slept beneath them, The army of great Cyrus. Thousands died: The rest pushed on. At last green-girt Carmania Embowered us in her ever-flowering vales; And, chapleted with vine, westward we sped, Till, past all hope, we kenned our fleet and clasped Old comrades mourned as dead. Ptol. We have told our story, And made an honest boast. Our toils have rest: Not less the king may find that peace hath dangers Worse than the worst in war. Ant. The gods are with him. Sel. The gods of Greece are with him, but not all; And gods can change, like men. Ant. 'Tis true! let none That's pious trust the gods, however friendly, But, sharp-eyed watch and serve them. Phy. O ye gods! I'll keep a dog to help me at my watch, Noting your humours! Lords, if danger threaten, 'Tis Persia breeds that danger. Orxines— There was a Persian, noble, brave, their richest Satrap of Persis, faithful to our king— He's dead, and by the king's command, and wherefore? ‘He (Alexander) was strangely disturbed in mind when he came to understand what havock had been made of the tomb of Cyrus, which, as Aristobulus tells us, he found rifled and broken in pieces. This tomb was placed in the Royal Gardens at Pasargadæ, and round it was planted a grove of all kinds of trees: the place also was well watered, and the surface of the earth all round clothed with a beautiful verdure. The basis thereof consisted of one large stone of a quadrangular form. Above was a small edifice with an arched roof of stone, and a door, or entrance, so very narrow that the slenderest man could scarce pass through. Within this edifice was the golden coffin, wherein the body of Cyrus was preserved, as also the bed whose supporters were of massy gold curiously wrought; the covering thereof was of Babylonian tapestry; the carpets underneath of the finest wrought purple. . . . The inscription, which was wrote in the Persian language, was to this purpose: “O mortal, I am Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, founder of the Persian monarchy, and Sovereign of Asia. Grudge me not therefore this monument.”’—Arrian, translated by Rooke, vol. ii. p. 132. Why, 'twas a cry from bones, from offal, dust! We passed Pasargadæ upon our march: We found the tomb of Cyrus sack'd for gold:— A crime they called it—named it some strange name— 'Twas sacrilege! Ptol. Persia is not the danger: He's vulnerable inly, not without, Through that fierce will which makes of wrath a madness, Turns love to doom. Hephestion's brave and wise; He takes an ample sweep of virtues; still In valour he's not greater than Seleucus, Than Craterus in insight: yet the king Holds him more precious than the total host: Such love is peril: 'tis to keep two bodies, Two separate tenements of one frail life, And obvious each to Fortune's shaft—or Fate's. Sel. Phylax, what mean you by those twinkling eyes? You are bright, yet dark. In you two Demons kiss With love malign. Phy. Your pardon, mighty lord; I smiled at perils bred from the affections: I've heard of such ere now, but met them never. A Messenger (entering). The council meets at sunset, lords. Several Generals. Make speed! [They depart. Phy. Philotas, you were wiser than I knew! “'Tis there he's vulnerable.” Hate is insight. Scene II.—Palace at Susa. Alexander, Hephestion. Alex. The time is come; you stare;—the time decreed; Of Empire safe henceforth, or lost for ever: With a fierce joy I clasp this chief of battles Which dares me in my day of seeming peace. What think you of my fortunes? Heph. More and more They are like yourself: they wear a royal aspect. Alex. False! I am substance; and my fortunes hollow! To keep that little handful of my Greeks In girl-proud severance from the conquered world A dream it was, a dream! Heph. You said so early. Alex. To dispossess them of that dream-dominion;— I told you this must be:—Craterus—yourself— Seleucus—all—conspired in one reply, “The Greek will rather die.” Heph. We knew, and said it. Alex. I sought evasions; I deferred the time; I marched to Scythia, then to India on, Trusting that mellowing years might work a change. Prerogatives I linked, yet kept apart, To native hands conceding civil functions, Reserving still the warlike for the Greek; What find I now returning? Faction's fruits: The cry comes up:—discords, corruptions, slaughters, The honour of great houses violated, Their lands laid waste— These things must end: this missive comes to end them: Three years ago I pledged my royal word Asian recruits should stand at one with Greeks; A month, and thirty thousand join my ranks: Come weal, come woe, I keep my sacred pledge. Heph. All Greece will rise in storm. Alex. A storm shall meet it. Heph. Till now you have lived for ever in their praise. Alex. To breathe applauses is to breathe an air Defiled by breath of men: I stand, and stood On the mountain-tops, breathing the breath of gods. Fear nought: I see my way. Those Asian Empires Were things mechanic. Heph. Greek and Asian equalled, The Greek supremacy has died at birth. Alex. You see but half. Equality, when based On merit, means supremacy of Greek; For mind is merit, and the great Greek mind Supreme in nature's right. Our Greece shall rule Like elemental gods with nature blent, Yet not in nature merged. Heph. The first inception— Alex. I had foreseen it; and I'll have no first: Three changes I have welded into one. Thanks to Parmenio's death, the treasure's mine: It buys an Empire's safety. Half my Greeks Stagger beneath a load of debt: I'll pay it: That's change the first. I'll wed the races next: My bravest and my best—that's change the second— Shall marry Asian maids, by me so dowered As Hope had feared to hope. My generals, likewise, Shall mate the noblest ladies in the land; Which done, all war henceforth were household war. At that high marriage-feast mine earlier pledge Shall stand redeemed. Persian shall rise to Greek: Ay, but Greek soldiers rise to Asian kings! That's change the third. I blend these three in one. Heph. The gods inspired that scheme! Their help go with it! Alex. The gods are with me ever: but the Fates— Those whom the immortals dread, I too may fear. Heph. Touching the gods, I mark in you a change: At first you honoured much this Persian Faith, A Faith that soared, and yet went deep, insisting For ever on the oppugnancy divine 'Twixt Good and Ill, unlike those nymph-like Fancies, Glad offspring of Hellenic poet-priests, That, draped in Faith's grave garb, yet loosely zoned, But glide above the surfaces of things, And tutor us with smiles. That time is past. You honour still Egyptian rites and Asian; Persian no more. Alex. The man that founds an Empire Must measure all things by the needs of Empire: This Magian Faith will prove refractory: That truth it claims to hold, and hold alone, Burns in its eye, and eyes of them that serve it, A portion of their never-quenchèd Fire: Its spirit is the spirit of domination: I'll own no Persian worship. Heph. Is this just? You smile on Persia's court, upon its camp, Its nobles, and its merchants, and its peasants; Upon the noblest thing it hath you frown. Its domination means that Truth should rule, It seeks no thrones: you find no foe, but make one. Alex. 'Tis so. I ever make my choice of foes Not less than friends. I know this Faith must hate me: Like it there's none: the rest at heart are brothers; Their priests alike contented to be ruled, Their rites not hard to reconcile. Moreover, I know Calanus now: his Faith for me Holds something Persia's lacks. The Indian Seer Who scorns both kingly throne and beggar's cloak, Contemplative unvested 'neath the palms, Seems than the Magian more abstruse in lore And seated farther back in lordlier depths Of world-defying pride. Heph. His pride I doubt not: When first you found him on the banks of Indus In meditation 'mid his brethren throned, They to the greeting of a king vouchsafed not So much as this—the uplifting of their eyes. Alex. Not less he joined my march—though on conditions. Heph. The Indian's faith may soar as high as heaven: His pride is narrow as the Cynic's tub. Alex. You hate Calanus. Heph. What I love is Truth 'Tis great: and therefore humbleness must win it, Not pride, if won at all. Alex. We know but this— We walk upon a world not knowable Save in those things which least deserve our knowing. Yet capable, not less, of task sublime. My trust is in my work: on that I fling me, Trampling all questionings down. Heph. From realm to realm You have chased the foe like dreams. Alex. I sometimes think That I am less a person than a power, Some engine in the right hand of the gods, Some fateful wheel that, rolling round in darkness, Knows this—its work; but not that work's far scope. Hephestion, what is life? My life, since boyhood, Hath been an agony of means to ends: An ultimate end I find not. For that cause, On-reeling in the oppression of a void, At times I welcome what I once scarce brooked, The opprobrium of blank sleep— Enough of this. Discoursing of my plan I passed unnamed its needfullest part: you guess it: My marriage must inaugurate the rest, And yours, with mine: our captains, one and all, Will shape their course by yours. Heph. I understand not. Alex. Brothers till now we are not save in love: Within our children's veins one blood shall flow, Children of sisters. Now you know my meaning. Heph. I hear a music as of gods borne nigh; See nought. Alex. The scheme's not policy alone: 'Tis expiation likewise. Hearken, Hephestion: Above the body of Darius dead I vowed to reinstate his Royal House, My own just rights secured, nor hid my vow, Sending that holy corse to Sisygambis, The mother of the murdered, for the tomb. Of those fair sisters—children then they were— I chose the younger, destining my crown For her fair brows. Arsinbe to you (I named her once, but thought the theme unwelcome) My fancy gave. I find this may not be: Old Persia rests on laws immutable: The eldest daughter of the Royal House Must share the oldest throne on earth, and chief, Except her sire's. A marriage less than this To Persia were a stain, to Greece a weakness. These things are nought. The maids are good alike: You'll have the lovelier bride, the nobler I In Asian heraldry. That setting sun Dazzles my eyes, or else you're pale, Hephestion, You that paled never 'mid Gedrosian sands:— We buried many there. Deny the army The lists of the dead. Sel. (entering). So please the king, his council— Alex. I shall divulge this marriage to the council, And show this missive from the agèd queen So lofty, sad, yet grateful. I had forgotten:— Those spoils that Xerxes filched, those statues twinned That shine in brass before the palace portals, Harmodius and Aristogeiton styled, (I deem them unauthentic, like the merit Of those seditious boors whose names they boast) To Athens send, ordaining for their site Great Theseus' temple. Be it done ere morn. [Alexander departs, followed by Seleucus. Heph. 'Twas all but won: 'tis lost, and lost for ever! To her no loss: she knew not of my love: I half foresaw, and sent her never message. 'Twas but a child! Ah yes, yet childish eyes Shining through darkness could illume my dreams, Star-like could pierce the low-hung battle-cloud, In victory's hour could wake in me a heart Tenderly righteous. Palace of Old Tyre! Dark groves wherein the night-bird sang by day!— 'Twas but a child! Ah yes, yet childish hands 'Mid burning wastes could bind my brow with wreaths Cold as the northern morn; a childish voice, Still heard 'mid Lydian measures, could expel Their venomed softness leaving them but plaintive. Must all end thus? Oh mockery, mockery, mockery! Shall one be zealous for my body's health, Make inquisition of mine alter'd cheek, Adventure to exalt that fame I laugh at, The dignities I spurn, my golden fortunes, Yet, there where only lives my spirit, lay A hand more callous than his courser's hoof, And crush that thing he feels not?—Down, base thoughts! The crisis of his fortunes is upon him: A perilous crisis; it may be a fatal. I will not fail him at his utmost need: His love is with me, though he knew me never— Ill time were this, ill time for traitor's work! Her duty's plain: necessity goes with it— The thing that is must be. Scene III. Phylax (alone). Phy. Hephestion is daily more hard of access. I know not how I shall approach him near enough to wind him in my toils. Ho! sirrah! [to his Page] know you any among them that attend on Hephestion? Page. Sir, there is among them a youth, Peitho by name, one with as many humours as a monkey. Many a time hath he kept the suitors of Hephestion waiting three hours in the ante-room while we played at games. Phy. Play with him to-morrow, and lose. Give him these gold pieces. Tell him that thy master hath heard much of his trustiness, and holds him in esteem. Bid him come here at his leisure, and play games with thee. Scene IV.—Palace at Susa. Sisygambis, the Magian Astar. Ast. Madam, fear nought: she'll know the right and do it: The maid's no Greek, nimble of spirit but small: Her mind is spacious, and her heart is strong: In all things still she sees the thing essential. Such is the royal nature. Sis. For this marriage The royal in her nature is against it: She neither loves the Greek nor leans to marriage. She's younger than her years, tho' when a child Seemingly older. Ast. Madam, in high courage She's older than her mother at her death, And less through weakness of her sex dependent. She will not wreck the realm. Sis. She comes: farewell. [Astar departs. Arsinoe enters, and, after kneeling, sits at the feet of Sisygambis. O large and lustrous eyes through tears up-gazing, What find you in these agèd eyes of mine, Murky and dim, these wan, discrownèd brows, Worthy such sweet regard? Large eyes, gaze on! You see dead Persia and her fallen House: Their monument am I. Ars. Mother! my mother! Sis. That name you gave me when your mother died: It reach'd me first from younger lips than yours: It was not mine to kiss those lips in death: Another closed those eyes. Ars. Mother! my mother! Sis. To them that with officious zeal presumed Whispering of comfort, thus I made reply, “He died contending for this Persian realm: Comfort, save that, I spurn.” Ars. Though earth were ashes That comfort still remains. We needs must weep; We need not fear, methinks, nor hate, nor murmur. Sis. The strongest hand of earth let fall the sceptre: The wide world shuddered like a shrine profaned: Then from the gulf there rose a voice, “That sceptre A slender hand shall lift from out the dust.” The voice was low. I heard it and survived. Ars. Whose hand? Sis. The hand that lies across my knees: This missive's heavy with a royal suit: The Greek king claims that hand. Ars. He claim it!—Never! Sis. Then from a Persian hand comes Persia's doom: This bridal had restored her Royal House. Ars. It was the Greek king laid it low, my mother. Sis. That laid it low, and now that fain would raise it: The Greeks have given consent. Ars. The Greeks consent! The Greeks! The Greeks dispose of Persia's daughters! I'd have them nor for arbiters nor subjects! Of all those Greeks, I know but one, one only, Not shallow, loud, ignoble and untrue— Hephestion; him who charmed for us at Tyre Sadness to peace. Mother, if he has sisters I think they are hard to win. Sis. He weds your sister. Ars. Hephestion weds my sister! Sis. Woos her and weds her. You love your sister: does her marriage please you? Ars. I know not. Sis. Or perhaps displease? Ars. I know not. Sis. These marriages must be, or both, or neither: By Persia's law the princess eldest-born Mustfill earth's proudest throne: that throne is yours— Unless you spurn it, yours. The king is proud: The king's one friend will teach you how to win him And make him father of this fallen realm: Your sister's husband needs must be your brother. Ars. There's sweetness in that thought. Oh mother, mother! Sis. Now that your hands are shifted from your face The pallor's less. Ars. Oh mother! Spare to urge me! Scarce for love's sake, methinks, could I surrender That maiden life, so holy, calm, and clear: I cannot wed, not loving. Sis. I have done. The nobly-modest usage of the East Left marriages to parents. Yours are dead: And therefore you are free. This day a pact is broken with a grave: It was a dead king, not a king that lives, Who made this marriage: in his death he conquered: Earth's victor stood above a shape sword-pierced: A stricken shape he stood, a paler shape; He saw the royal blood, the blood of Persia, And lo, the conqueror changed to penitent: That hour he vowed, suspending his advance, To chase the murderer's steps from land to land Thenceforth avenger. This too, this he vowed, To set thy race, Darius, on thy throne Partaken, not usurped. The tidings reached me, Child, with your father's corse. Ars. 'Tis past! My father! Forgive this base deserter of thy blood, Trivial impugner of thy sacred will, Withstander of thy country's peace and greatness! My mother, write—write quick—that I consent. [Arsinoe moves to a window. The Queenmother writes. As her letter is finished Arsinoe returns. Sis. You've been a gazer on our Persian heavens: The stars are in your face. 'Tis sad no more. Ars. The tears which I should weep are bright on yours. Sis. Age frets at all. Whoe'er had been your husband It may be I had wept. Persia is saved. Scene V.—Susa. Alexander, Calanus. Alex. Father, think well of it. Our Faith offends you. Cal. 'Tis a child's babble: and a child were he That either loved or loathed it. Wisdom's sons— None else in things divine have serious part— Can mark the shadows dance upon the dust, With brow that knows no change. Alex. I am not Greek, Though king of Greeks. My race belongs to Greece Of the kingly age alone. Commend you Persia? Cal. A priest of Persia bows his head to kings. One time their Magians, at a king's command, Linked with their order one who was a Greek, Themistocles by name. Their wisdom's earthly: Their Faith is but a law, and not a thought: They make their God a king, give him a rival, An Ahriman with Ormuzd still at feud, Vexing with war the everlasting Rest, The One Existence in and under all, For all things else but seem, and are illusions, The Intelligence unmoved whose thoughts are things, Who dreams, and worlds are made. Alex. Is Egypt nobler? Cal. Egypt had wisdom once: her kings have slain it; With them her priests connived; the guiltier far: They shared with kings; and government was all. Egypt is but a kingdom; kingdoms pass: A race alone survives. Son, what wouldest thou? Alex. A single kingdom one o'er all the earth. Cal. So much of earth as shall suffice for grave Is man's, my son—no more. The on-striding foot No whither tends. The way is up, not onward. Ten years you have wasted conquering half the world. Alex. Ay! Time is needed. There's the pang—none sharper! Cal. Eternity alone from Time can free you; One step can lodge you in her changeless realm: There from the palm eternal drops no scale: The ambrosial rose never lets fall a leaf: The ever-setting sun is never set:— That realm is Thought. My son, you have won your kingdom: Spurn it, and live. Alex. But half my task is finished. Once wrought— Cal. You'd be a god on earth, and do What God has left undone. The external world To the end must be a world of blind confusions, Some little curbed by little chiefs and kings, With others who in industries cognate Partake with these. Be still: the Eternal Patience Preserves that world the Eternal Thought creates. Alex. (after a pause). How many are your lesser deities? Cal. Their number's infinite. Divinity Had ne'er been plural else. A finite number Would spawn us idols. Alex. They are less than Brahm? Cal. Less than his priests, my son, of whom am I. Men know us not. Of old the patriarch Brahmins Sat in still groves, their flocks their kingdoms then, For man was then a Household, not a Realm, And lived for their Creator, not for things. When riot filled the earth, and lust, and war, These from the embraces of the race depraved Severed their sons. They dwelt apart revered Even by the vile. What man first was, we are: We keep our heritage and know not change: The inferior castes fell from us. [Craterus enters. Alex. I must leave you. Cal. I claim your pledge. You're in my debt a pyre. Alex. What mean you? Cal. King, you sware to speed me home: My body fails: my spirit's freedom nears me: The God I serve rejects reluctant guests. I mount that pyre alive: the finite atom Rejoins the infinite. Alex. A pride there is That dwarfs the pride of kings. Calanus, live! Your pupil, not your king, kneels to implore you. Cal. I have taught you nought. Cra. I see it in his eye: His will is fix'd. Alex. (rising). I'll have no part in this: Craterus, subdue that overweening will; Win him to live:—but still revere my pledge. [Departs. Scene VI.—A Terrace of the Queen-mother's Palace at Susa. Arsinoe, Hephestion. Ars. You knew her: that is well. Heph. Who knew your mother Till death shall reverence woman's kind. In her, Though doubly-dowered, a mother and a queen, There lived a soft perpetual maidenhood, An inexperienced trust, timid, yet frank, Shy, yet through guilelessness forgetting shyness. She seemed a flower-like creature come to fruit: She moved among her babes, an elder sister; Then, wakened by an infant cry or laugh, Full motherhood returned. Ars. Had you but known her In later days, and in her deeper woe! It nought embittered her. Flower-like you called her: She was a flower that sweetened with like breath The darkness and the day: she turned from none: Her heart was liberal in accepting comfort Such as the least might minister. In griefs She died; but not from grief. Heph. It was her death That changed you first to grave? Ars. Not that alone; The guidance of her orphans fell to me, And taught me soon my weakness. You, Hephestion, Have known severer labours, cares more stern; Have won great battles; captured mighty cities; You—none but you—could knit those rival chiefs:— “His weight of duties seemed but weight of wings,” The king spake thus. Heph. His fortunes were the wind That raised those wings aloft. Ars. You owe him much. Heph. You think so? Ha! Ars. You loved him; and you served him: What kindness equals this—to accept our aid? What anguish bitterer than the aid rejected? He told me of a fame so wide— Heph. I spurn it! To me 'twas ever little: now 'tis nought. Ars. You praise him; yet you will not I should praise him: I praise him ill in truth. The king was kind: He sent me ofttimes greeting. You sent none:— “Children,” thus mused I, “seem so soon forgotten.” Heph. I see a glare in the sky. What light is that? Ars. Our Persian moon, ascending, sends before her A splendour as of morn. Heph. The sun sets red: The heaped clouds totter round his burning halls Like inward-tumbling bulwarks of a city Consumed by flames of war—by earthquake rocked— Twin dooms!—I would— Ars. Hephestion, look not on them: They fling upon your face a threatening light, Hiding that face I knew. Beside me stand: Watch we that moon. The West is like the past; The East grows bright; the eternal hope is hers. We stand between these two. Your hand is hot: Your tasks consume you: pray you to remit them! My prayer will soon have won a bolder right: Your king, that knew not of my young ambition, Has crowned it, as you know. Heph. The crown? You sought it! Ars. To be your sister was that young ambition— One to a child so gentle, to a woman Must needs be gentler, sister of his wife, And wife of one far less his king than friend: You'll make me know him, teach me how to serve him, My censor, yet my brother. Heph. Oh my sister! The ambitions of this world could ne'er be yours:— The doubt's not there. Arsinoe, are you happy? Ars. Is happiness much worth? I am at peace. Heph. Youth craves delight. Ars. Not always. If in others We deem the greediness for joy ignoble, Almost immodest, what were it in me? I am the daughter of a fallen house: My father died deserted and betrayed, Vanquished, discrowned, with none but foes for mourners: My mother— Oh, Hephestion, it were sin In me to crave delight! Heph. Unceasing vigils, Unsparing labours, dangers, ay, and worse, Domestic treasons—these have been the lot Of him you wed. The immeasurable soul That in him, sea-like, swells to the light sustains him:— The afflictions which he feels not for himself, You needs must feel and fear. Ars. Feel them I may: I know not if I ever feared; I think I never shall. Fear not for me, Hephestion. Not wholly sorrows were the sorrows past: Those that must come will not be wholly sorrows. Oh, there's a sweetness spread o'er all the earth Grief's trampling foot makes sweeter! Stormiest clouds Sweep on in splendour to some heavenly music By us unheard. Hephestion, I can trust That Power who will not always keep His secret: The life He sends must needs, though sad, be great; The death he sends be timely. Life is peace To those who live for duty. Purer peace Will find us after death. Heph. The moon is risen: I see it not, but see you in its light Like some young warrior, silver-mailed and chaste; Or liker yet to her, my childhood's wonder, Great Artemis, as I saw her statue first Against the broad full moon, while snows high heaped Ridged her dark wintry porch. Farewell, Arsinoe! There was a mist that brooded on my spirit: That mist is raised. To you no ill can come That virtue will not change to its own essence: Your life, if long, will prove a glorious life; If short—you wish it short—revive in glory: The king will give you of his great, strong heart What he can spare to woman, and revere More than he loves. He honoured once your Faith: Would it were his! Ars. I think that will not be. Heph. My tasks are heavy now: until this marriage We meet not oft. Ars. See you that grove, Hephestion, Still dark, yet glistening in the ascended moon? A grave lies there that covers one you knew. She was my friend. My heart was held to hers So oft in watches of the long, sweet night And couch partaken, that a part thereof Went down with her into that grave. One day Beside that spot we spake: she died soon after. She sent to you a message. We will sit The eve before this bridal by that grave. Something I'll tell you of her; but not much; Show you a book of Persian songs that pleased her; And haply read you one. Till then farewell. Scene VII.—Susa. The Gate of the Bridal Pavilion. A crowd of Greeks and Asiatics. A Greek Soldier. Push on, spiritual Magian! Would thou wert pure spirit: so should I push through thee! 2nd Greek Soldier. The king hath spent the revenue of Persia for two years in discharging of his soldiers' debts. At first we Greeks would not send in our names, for a rumour lived that the king had a design to incorporate the Barbarians with Greeks in the ranks. We are no dullards. Then the king gave command to spread gold heaps on tables throughout the camp, and paid off all debts without registration of names. A Bactrian. Fie upon you, Greeks! Ye can neither trust nor be trusted. For one of you that leaps into the pit, there be three that lose all out of over wariness. Greeks new as bubbles are mated with Persian princesses! Back, soldiers! back, guards; make way for them that bear on their heads the cooling drinks! 2nd Greek Soldier. I crept into the hall and beheld the glory. It is three stadia in length within, and swathed in purple. The pillars are sixty feet high, plated with gold; and between them are tables. Our generals wore crowns higher than those of the Asian kings. By Hephestion walked Drypetis, sister of Arsinoe; by Perdiccas the daughter of Atropates; by Ptolemy and Eumenes the two daughters of Artabazus; and by Nearchus the daughter of old Mentor. There were a hundred generals mated, and ten thousand soldiers besides. 3rd Greek Soldier. I saw, outside, more than all thou saw'st within; and that was the good and useful kicking bestowed upon Phylax! His face was as though he had swallowed his own ratsbane. Hephestion had passed into the hall; and they that attended him, as if by urgency of the crowd, pressed on the doctor. Hephestion is the bravest of all our generals, and the most loving to boot, and he looks ruddier than he hath looked of late. For three weeks past his step has been less buoyant than once, and fever-quickened at times. A Persian Barber. Good woman, my wife, answer me this if washing for the Greeks hath made thee a philosopher: what profit shall fall to us poor folk from all this royal marrying and junketing? Barber's Wife. Tush, thou foolish man! know'st thou not that ere three days are past the price of unguents—yea, and of bread—will have fallen to one-half? The Sentinels. Back from the gates! A passage! [Generals walk out in procession, wearing crowns, Seleucus and Ptolemy first. Sel. A sight for gods! That last libation paid, Each feaster lifting still his hand, on the sudden A sunbeam smote along the golden cups, Till half the chamber flashed from end to end Like the sun's path o'er sea! Ptol. Far things I saw not: My place was on the dais, near the queen. The strong eye of the king made inquest ever, As when, ere fight, it roams the battle-field, Around the hall. Courteous and kind, though grave, Hephestion reassured a startled bride, And on a face, whose smiles with tears were spangled, Made light at last prevail. She sat at first Heart-wildered—yet amused; her roe-like eyes The darker for the paleness of her cheeks And garland-shaded brows. The feast not over, Peace came to her through trust in him close by: Wife-love had made a seven years' growth. Sel. Arsinoe? Ptol. Nor startled she, nor pensive, glad or sad: She looked like one who, some deep chasm o'erpassed, Sits thenceforth safe; who—all things sacrificed— Within their monumental urn retains them Securer for that funeral prison cold, Or else in some far hope. (A cry, “Way for the king!”) [Alexander issues forth, attended by Craterus and Asian princes. The Persians kneel as he passes: the Greeks stand. Alex. Rejoice, ye men of Maced on and Persia: Two realms this day are joined as body and soul:— Craterus, I miss Calanus. Cra. Sir, he's dead. He sent for me last eve, at set of sun, Demanding swift fulfilment of your pledge, Or else you were forsworn. Ere rose the day On whose white brow I wished no shade to fall, The pyre had reached its height; but he who claimed it Refused to issue from his cloud of thought Till noon had come. Alex. I marked a smoke at noon, Susa in sight, upon my homeward way: Relate the order of your grim proceeding. Cra. The rites were his of Indian death when proudest. First in the death-procession was a horse Snow-white, of breed Nisæan; next, slave-borne, The jewelled vases, and the robes, your gifts; Calanus, in his litter, last, flower-crowned, With old white head clear shining in the sun, And chaunting hymns. King-like the man dispersed, The pyre attained, your gifts among his friends, And bade them with a cheerful face and strong Rejoice till night. King-like he clomb the pyre; In the host's sight he waved his hand—then sank. The elephants shrilled sharp; the trumpets pealed; The flames rushed up. We saw that hand no more. Alex. He sent me no farewell. Cra. Your pardon, sir: His last was this:—“Commend me to the king: Tell him we meet once more at Babylon.” Alex. Ill day he chose; and spleenful his departure: A man should lack not manners in his death: His parting words excuse him: he was mad: “At Babylon”—he's dead, and ne'er will see it; Nor I, who live. I ever hated ruins. Scene VIII.—Opis, on the Tigris. Large bodies of soldiers assembled before a platform occupied by Alexander's Generals. 1st Soldier. Would that Alexander were taller; so should we have a sight of him! The Scythian ambassadors showed their discretion when they wondered. They looked to see a reasonably sized giant. An Officer. Who gave thee leave, sirrah, to see that the king is not tall? 2nd Soldier. He that is a Greek, let him be wary as a Greek this day! There is a design, and it is bad. The king is good: therefore it was Craterus that moved him. 1st Soldier. Nay, Craterus is honest, and loves soldiers worn in the wars. 2nd Soldier. Craterus is honest: therefore it was Antigonus that deceived the king. He shall bleed for it. We let pass the Persian pomps and the shame of the cavalry; but if Barbarians be equalled with us in the infantry, better it were that all the Greeks were drowned in one day! Three years since, when the king promised equality to the Barbarians, we Greeks inwardly believed that he spake in craft. This can be proved upon oath. Therefore, if he keepeth his promise, he deceiveth his friends and fawneth on his foes. But for these new-married we should all be of one mind. 1st Soldier. The Persians be all liars! They pretend that they are not equalled with us Greeks. They are equalled but for their own bad heart. Let them worship the gods, and not grovel in their idolatry of fire! What hindereth piety but a bad heart? Therefore, if a bad Persian be made equal to a good Greek, the Greeks have a manifest wrong. Besides, if the many be equalled with the few, the few shall be drowned in the many. The Phalanx grins, the Hydaspists growl, the Escort knows itself doomed. Papers have been found scattered abroad:—here is one that lay near the tent of old Phylax: “Sleep ye, O ye Greeks, or be ye awake? There was one that watched for the army—Philotas.” All night long, in our encampments, thirteen men lectured us of our wrongs, and twelve times the army gave acclamations. A Mede. Silence is stronger than acclamations. Soldiers. Eavesdropper, who sent thee hither? Take that! (Striking their daggers through him.)To spite us the more he died in silence. The gods be pitiful to all poor dumb beasts! [A cry, “Push forward; the king has arrived.”] Alex. Ye sons of Macedon and Greece, attend: 'Tis rumoured there are still among you debtors: A debtor is a slave: who serves his king Must serve in freedom. I discharge those debts. A Mutineer. He must not be suffered to speak. Alex. You are mostly strong; but some are men in years, War-wearied and outworn. Would any homeward? At home they shall not sit abjects in age, But largess-laden say to those that praise them, “The ranks wherein our glorying manhood toiled Are open still to all.” A Ringleader of the Mutineers. Are open, he means, to Persians! He the son of Zeus! Lift up them that shall speak for you! [Thirteen ringleaders are lifted up on the shoulders of the crowd, and wave standards. A cry is raised on all sides. “Send us all home, since you need us no longer. Go to war with none to help you save Zeus, your father!”] Ptol. (to Alexander). They'll turn on you, like hunds upon the huntsman! [Alexander leaps down among the crowd, followed by his Generals. They seize the thirteen ringleaders, and drag them up the steps of the platform. Alex. Speed! To this headless rabble give their heads! [The Generals fling the heads of the ringleaders among the mutineers. Stand back! I go alone: let none attend me. [Alexander takes his stand on a low part of the platform, level with the heads of the crowd. Alex. Ye swine-herds, and ye goat-herds, and ye shepherds, That shamelessly in warlike garb usurped Cloak your vile clay, my words are not for you; There stand among you others, soldiers' sons, Male breasts, o'er-writ with chronicles of wars, To them I speak. What made you that ye are The world's wide wonder and the dread of nations? Your king! What king? Some king that ruled o'er lands Illimitable, and golden-harvested From ocean's rim to ocean? Sirs, 'twas one With petty realm, foe-girt and cleft with treasons, Dragged up from darkness late and half alive. From these beginnings I subdued the earth:— For whom? For you! The increase is yours: for me Whose forehead sweated and whose eyes kept watch, Remains the barren crown and power imperial. I found but seventy talents in my chest: Full many a soldier with his late-spoused bride Gat better dower. I found within my ports A fleet to Persia's but as one to ten; I sold my royal farms and built me ships; I found an army lean as winter wolves On Rodope snow-piled; I changed to bread My sceptre's gems and fed it. Forth from nothing I called that empire which this day I rule. My father left me this—his Name: I took it And kneaded in the hollows of my hands: I moulded it to substance, nerved it, boned it; I breathed through it my spirit to be its life; Clothed it with vanquished nations, sent it forth Sworded with justice, wisdom for its helm, The one just empire of a world made one. Forget ye, sirs, the things ye saw—the States Redeemed of Lesser Asia, our own blood, The States subdued, first Syria, then Phœnicia, Old Tyre the war-winged tigress of the seas, And Egypt next? The Pyramids broad-based Descrying far our advent rocked for fear Above their buried kings: Assyria bowed: The realm of Ninus fought upon her knees Not long: the realm of Cyrus kissed the dust: From lost Granicus rang the vanquished wail To Issus: on Arbela's plain it died. Chaldæa, Persis, Media, Susiana— We stepped above these corpses in our might To Parthia, and Hyrcania, Bactriana, And Scythia's endless waste— The cry from Paromisus gave response To Drangiana's dirge: thy doom, Aria, To wan-faced Acherosia spake her own: In vain the Indian Caucasus hurled down From heaven-topped crags her floods to bar my way: Flood-like we dashed on valleys known till then To gods, not men, of Greece. Bear witness, ye Aornos, from thine eagle-baffling crest Vainly by Hercules himself assailed, Plucked down by us; and Nysa, Bacchus-built, When Bacchus trod the East. What hands were those Which from the grove Nysæan and fissured rocks Dragged the green ivies? Whose the brows that wore them? Whose lips upraised the Bacchus-praising hymn? Whose hands consummated his work—restored To liberty and laws the god-built city?— Sirs, the vile end of all is briefly told. We pierced the precinct of the Rivers Five, Indus, and other four. The jewelled crowns Of those dusk sovereigns fell flat before us: The innumerous armies opened like the wind That sighs around an arrow, while we passed: Those moving mountains, the broad elephants, Went down with all their towers. We reached Hydaspes: Nations, the horizon blackening, o'er it hung:— Porus, exult! In ruin thine were true; While mine, in conquest's hour, upon the banks Of Hyphasis—What stayed me on my way? An idiot army in mid victory dumb! I gave them time; three days: those three days past, Ye heard a voice, “The gods forbid our march:” Sirs, 'twas a falsehood! On the Olympian height That day the immortal concourse crouched for shame: Their oracles were dead. 'Twas I that spake it! I was, that hour, the Olympian height twelve-throned That hid the happy auspice in the cloud, And this mine oracle; “Of those dumb traitors Not one shall wash his foot in Ganges' wave.” I built twelve altars on that margin, each A temple's height, and fronting eastward—why? To lift my witness 'gainst you to the gods! Once more as then I spurn you, slaves! Your place Is vacant. Time shall judge this base desertion Which leaves me but the conquered to complete The circle of my conquests. Gods, it may be, Shall vouch it holy, men confirm it just;— Your places in the ranks are yours no more. [Alexander departs, attended by his Generals. 1st Mutineer. We are out of the ranks. 2nd Mutineer. He will conquer the rest of the world with the Persians. He will give unto Persians the title of kinsmen, and the privilege of the kiss. 3rd Mutineer. We must throng unto the palace and throw down our arms: we must kneel in the courts day by day, and lie before the gates. He will come out, and forgive us, and lead us with him to Ecbatana. 4th Mutineer. As for those thirteen, it is certain they died very justly, since they deceived the army. Scene IX.—Ecbatana. The House of Phylax. Phy. (to his Page). Sirrah, attend! The king hath arrived newly from Opis, and this day maketh a discourse in the great temple. I am lame yet, and go not forth. Report unto me that which he delivereth. Spy out likewise where Hephestion lodgeth. [The Page departs.] The hatreds that I sowed have but lifted the king to higher greatness. As he subdued them of Asia, so now hath he subdued the Greeks. It is but through that other that he can be dealt with. For one so young, Philotas could see. While he lived I went whither I would under his wings: now the generals look blacker on me day by day. It is Hephestion that setteth them against me. Since that disgrace I have eaten no meal with relish. The queen and the princess are arrived from Susa: and all Ecbatana is overswarmed with a vermin of Asian princes. Yea, verily, it is the hour of his triumph. Scene X.—Postern of the Great Temple at Ecbatana. A Soldier (approaching it). Ho, friend sentinel! Let me pass thee, for ancient love. Art thou in a trance, or art thou dead, with that white face? Sentinel. Thou saw'st him not—him that entered but now? Soldier. Thou dreamest. The agora swarms: but at this side there hath been none in sight. Sentinel. As I live I saw him draw nigh. I drew both bars across the gate. He entered as though there had been no hindrance. Soldier. Knewest thou the man? Sentinel. When close to me, yea. The armour was the same; and the gleam of the steel shone through the blood. The iron-grey hair bristled up as of old, like a winter hedge with hail on it; but the scar on the forehead was redder, and there stood blood-drops in his eyes. I served him for fifteen years, and saw him every day to the last, save five. It was he that once when I struck a woman left me this mark on my hand. Soldier. Who was he? Sentinel. In thine ear—Parmenio! He is gone in among the lords in council. Hush! I know by that shout that Alexander is entering the temple. Scene XI.—The Great Temple at Ecbatana. Alexander, his Generals, and the Magnates of his Empire, Greek and Asiatic. Alex. I greet you, lords of every race alike And every nation, joined henceforth in one: Well meet we in old Media's mother-city, And fair the omen. Lords, that doubt which dogged My steps, extinguished with revolt extinguished, My fortunes touch at last their zenith height And sail among the stars. The future waits us. 'Tis rumoured that my face is toward the West: There's time enough for that. Limit and Term Govern the world. Completion of my work Here in the orient inchoate needs ten years Which past will leave me still a man in prime. India of Ganges yet remains to conquer: We have still to stud with western colonies Our eastern realms, to light them with Greek schools, And link our Indian with our Persian thrones By politic commerce. Lords, I have given command To free insulted Tygris from her dykes, Built up by kings who feared both trade and freedom. I have sent Nearchus to the Arabian coasts To burn the pirates' ships and drown their crews: Indus shall wed Euphrates, devious thence Shall brim Orontes, and make broad Ilissus. A word on Greece: Craterus makes speed to her: Antipater, that ruled in Macedon, Shall yield him place and here reply to charges That touch both fame and life. I smiled to hear That, militant against our Persian pomps, He wears plain raiment edged with border grey Alike at banquet and on judgment-throne: His purple is within! I trust 'tis false He traffics with the Ætolians: trust 'tis falser That when, by sentence of the assembled host, The long time nameless ruler of this city Who filled of old yon seat—now vacant—died, He said, “Parmenio false! then who is true? Parmenio falsely slain! then who is safe?” These things I nought prejudge. To weightier matters. We send this day to Greece two great decrees; The first, amid the Olympian games proclaimed, Shall spread a general gladness. It remands All exiled citizens to their ancient homes Save those convict of sacrilege or murder, And wins us friends in every Grecian state. The last demands for me that titular meed Decorous wont of ceremonial worship, Which, not alone an offspring of the gods, But likewise upon mortals well-deserving Though wanting Death's immortalizing touch, Confers mankind's award—honours divine. Lords, ere this council separates — (Turning to Perdiccas) Where's Hephestion? Per. Hephestion, sir, is slightly fever-touched And keeps his house. Alex. Command that Phylax tend him. Hephestion's much for peace, and willed this day In speech to praise it: that shall serve to-morrow: Till then my further purpose I withhold. This day the Feast of Dionysus rules: He played me false the night that Cleitus died; The rights of the Dioscuri that night Supplanted his: in that no part was mine; But kings remember benefits alone:— At Thebes, his chiefest seat, I did him wrong: I do repent that slaughter Lords, farewell! Scene XI.—Ecbatana. Phylax and his Page. The Page. I heard all. The king made a gladsome speech, and showed that now at last his fortune had topped the summit, and sailed away among the stars. There shall be wars no more; but here he will abide in glory and feasting for ever and ever. Hephestion is sick in the lesser palace; and this missive commandeth that thou shalt raise him up, and make him a sound man by eleven o'clock tomorrow; for he must exhort the council at noon. Phy. It is well: depart! [The Page retires.]The gods are turned cynic, and will have Jest to rule! My master, Diogenes, is dead, and is carried to Olympus: his sign is the Constellation of the Tub, and he raineth influence upon earth. Many a month have I lain in wait for Hephestion, and now the king putteth him into my hand! Now also the Alexandrian star is at its highest! Philotas! I were an infidel if I recognized not the omen. A fresh wind bloweth in from the garden. Red rose, thou blushest unto me! White lily, thou curtsiest unto me! Thais of the Feast and Phryne of the Bath, I scorn you alike! These sealed packets hold minerals more mastering than ever built up womanbones. Here is “courage by the ounce,” and there is “needful flight.” This is “jealousy;” and here is—I have found it at last—“long silence.” I could label these heart-quellers with heavenly names; but it sufficeth. Hephestion, if thou meetest Philotas in the shades, salute him from me! ACT V. Scene I.—The Road to Babylon. Ptolemy, Seleucus, Eumenes, and Antigonus. Ptol. Wait we the king: he lags not far behind us. Sirs, be ye wary in your homeward letters; The Greeks are reverential of the gods: The fane of Esculapius razed to earth In vengeance for Hephestion's death, may move them. Eum. Ulysses, keenest-witted of man's race, Made boast, “No Greek with hand so large as mine Has paid the gods their dues.” Ant. The Medes are wroth: Their mules and horses shorn, they deemed the rite The obsequious tribute of a royal mourning: When from their city walls the summit fell The rite was new: they frowned. Ptol. So frowned the Persians, Their “Quenchless Fire” extinguished. Sel. Let them frown! When that mute tent rolled forth its thunder-peals I drew my breath. I said, “The king will live.” Ptol. There lives no Greek that wept not for Hephestion: Men say, “The army's strength remains: its youth— The beauty of the battle—victory's gladness— These, these are dead.” 'Twas not his words or deeds: For this they loved him—that the good in each Flowered in his presence, making fresh the soul. Sel. His cavalry shall bear his name for ever: Henceforth who rules it as his vicar rules, Armed with his ring. His sister-tended bride Delights her sad sick-bed with his last words, “My faithful, true, and honourable wife:” If any happy lived, and timely died, It is the man we miss. Eum. He, too, died timely— Phylax—the king struck never wholesomer stroke! The soldiers grudged him burial; for which cause The four-legged cynics of his sect interred him. Sel. The king draws near: he sees it now, yon city, The tower; the palace-front; the hanging gardens; The cliff-like walls unending! Eum. A procession! [A sacerdotal procession advances. At the same time Alexander joins them, attended by Generals. Chaldœan Priest (kneeling to Alexander). Berosus, and the priesthood of Chaldæa In us, dread sovereign, at your feet— Alex. Speak on. Chaldœan Priest. Since first that royal face made bright our world, Since first that royal voice sent forth command To raise once more the temple of great Belus— [The other priests cry out: “At Persia's cost! at hated Persia's cost”— Chaldœan Priest continues. High as it stood ere marred by Xerxes' crime, Our prayer was this, to welcome earth's supreme To Babylon, his seat. Vain hopes of man! The omens frown on us. Alex. The worse for them! Chaldœan Priest. Approach not Babylon, at least, with brow Dusk from a sunset sky! Make circuit first Round gate and wall: and enter, face to east! Alex. What thinks of omens Ptolemy, our wisest? Ptol. Sir, than the sceptics I am sceptic more: They scoff to boast their wit: I scoff at witlings. Sir, Reason rules but in her own domain, Beyond whose lawful bounds, her “Yea” and “Nay” I hold for equal weights in equal scales That rest in poise. Of things beyond the sense, Whereon in part this visible order rests, As spirits, ghosts, auguries, and mystic warnings Reason says nought: their sphere and ours are diverse: We know not if at points they intersect; If—casual, or by laws—their inmates touch. Our world's a part, and not a whole: its surface We pierce at points: the depth remains unknown. Sir, in these labyrinths there be phrenzies twain, Unreasoning each, whereof the proudest errs From Reason's path most far. Alex. Reason but walks Secure in footprints of Experience old, Whose testimony is diversely reported. Ptol. The affirmative experience is strong; The negative is nought, and breeds us nothing. Alex. What help remains where Reason speaks not? Ptol. Instinct: And as material instincts plainlier show In bird and beast than man, so spiritual instincts Speak plainlier haply through the popular voice Than censure of the wise. Alex. The people trust them: To ignore such things they count as ignorance: And deem themselves more knowing than the great: To spurn them were to chill the popular heart In the hour of need. I make the city's circuit, And enter not till morn—What ho! a herald! And pale with haste! Messenger (arriving). The river's banks have burst, The harvest's lost! uncounted herds are drowned, And eastward of the city all is flood:— All entrance there is barred. Alex. So ends the doubt: Westward! The shortest road is ever best. Scene II.—Palace Terrace at Babylon. Ptolemy, Seleucus, Eumenes, Cassander. Eum. You shall do wisely, sir, not angering him: The king is triply altered since you saw him: Antipater, your father, should know this:— He is sad, and stern, and proud. Cas. My father's honour Is sacred as your king's. Year following year, Olympias, haughtiest of her sex, and subtlest, Scorning an equal, hating a superior, Warred on his worth. He deigned her no reply: He kept his charge, old Macedon, in peace: Yearly he sent his king recruits, and ever Held his firm foot upon revolted Greece. He's strong in truth. Ptol. The king can bear all truth; Yet trusts not truth when braggart. This remember; Be ceremonious when you see him first: Hating these pomps, he hates those too that grudge them. Sel. Hephestion's death some whit disturbed the king: The obsequies complete, he brightens daily: Would you had seen the pyre! Ptol. Describe that pyre: 'Twill make him understand the royal sorrow: It was grief's madness—yet its beauty too. Sel. Sir, 'twas a work of nations in a month: A mile of Babylon's huge wall went down To fashion forth its base: the cost thereof Had ten times built the Athenian Parthenon: 'Twas earth's supremest structure, seen, and lost. Forests down-felled sent forth its colonnades, Huge pines, that, range o'er range to heaven ascending, Forgat not yet their friends, the winds, but sighed As on their native hills. In silver robes Those far-retiring columns shone, sun-touched, Tier above tier; the level spaces 'twixt them Gold-zoned in circling cornices distinct With sculptured frieze Titanic—giant wars, The strength upheaved of earth assailing heaven Kept down by overhanging weight of gods. Seen 'gainst the blue, were Syren shapes that lured The seeming mariner to death; with these, White groups of sea-nymphs weeping round a wreck: So fine the art, half Asian and half Greek, That, from their wreathèd conchs and shells unwinding, The tube-enthrallèd zephyrs breathed around Such strains as sailors hear on haunted shores: Far off the song was sweetest, saddest near. Eum. To me 'twas marvellous most by night. Sel. The stars Died out: the purple vault deepened to black Above that lower firmament of lights Which seemed a heaven more festive, nearer earth A many-shining city of the gods. All night the wind increased, till that strange music Swelled to a dirge so deep that some who heard Went mad, they say, and died. Eum. When midnight came The king gave word. The omnipresent fire Leaped to mid-heaven. The packed horizon showed As though the innumerous glebe had turned to man; And each face pale as death! Ptol. You have seen the site: 'Twill need the gales of many a stormy winter To clear away those ashes. Cas. True: chest-deep My horse staggered among them. Griefs like these Tread out our lesser woes. The king would teach us The transience of man's greatness and his joy: Now know I why he built of wood not stone: He built us up a lesson. Eum. What? that grief Is transient likewise? Cas. Nay, I meant not that. Ptol. He taught a nobler lesson. Has he learned it? Scene III.—Hall of the Palace of Babylon. Alexander on his throne surrounded by his Generals. The nobles of Babylon and the neighbouring provinces are ranged round the hall. Alex. I have had enough of councils. We'll be brief: The Grecian embassies shall take precedence In the order of their temples' dignity, First Elis, Delphi second, Corinth third. Whence come the others? Eum. Sire, from Carthage one; She sinned with Tyre: four from Italian States, The Bruttians, the Lucanians, the Tyrrhenians, And that new city, Rome. Alex. A bandit's den! Its earliest citizens were robber tribes; And, faithful to their past, they are leagued this day With Antium's pirates. Drive them home! One day They'll know a Grecian heel. To the work in hand. Princes of long-dejected Babylon That yearly bent her brow more near the ground, Rejoice! her days of mourning are gone by. I had decreed never to see this city, Chief seat of Earth's first empire and her worst. What changed that edict? Sirs, the advancing knowledge That that true Empire shaped and made by me— That Empire which, the hour Parmenio died, I vowed, from Scythia marching on to India, Should know no limit and no term—that Empire High as the mind of man and wide as earth— The knowledge that that Empire ne'er can die. That knowledge mine, I willed to weld in one The first link and the last in the chain of Empires; Once here, the spirit of the past came o'er me: The earliest seat of Empire claimed its right: The on-flowing tide of power, 'gainst nature's law At my command rolled back. A conqueror's hand, Forgetting this, that victory should be just, Was heavy on your nation, sirs, of old, Grudged you your great Euphrates, sluiced it hence, Dried up its city-channel: I restore it. I have dug for you a harbour: Indian fleets Therein shall sway their masts with lighter crafts Freighted from Egypt, and our Grecian Isles With help of broad canals from Syrian shores By Grecian science planned, by Asian gold 'Mid deserts excavated. Yestereve Your eyes beheld a pledge of this high future, The meeting of two fleets, from India one, The other, recent from Ægean waves, Dragged overland to Thapsacus, and thence Launched on Euphrates' stream. Assyrian lords, Your Babylon shall sit among her meads An inland Tyre, secure: your Temple and Tower, Passing the height of Egypt's pyramids, Revindicate their state. He nothing erred Who fixed of old in Babylon the seat Of eastern Empire. Round her throne shall stand Persepolis, Susa, and Ecbatana, Handmaids, not rivals. In the West shall rise Cities like these. Half-way! twixt East and West In single majesty supreme o'er all Shall Alexandria reign. [Acclamation from all sides: “It is the voice of a god,” during which Cassander enters the hall. He approaches the king, but without making the customary “Adoration.” Alex. Who's he that enters like the forest beast Irreverent, and unshamed? Remove the man. [Cassander is forcibly removed. The rest is brief. My purpose was—men knew it— To spend ten years consolidating in peace The eastern world. That purpose I discard: I trust the years no more: presuming death Strikes down the loftiest as the lowliest head, Rendering no count. I seek the West at once. West joined to East, and raised by subjugation, Since to be wisely ruled alone is freedom, Shall leave my work complete. Two mighty armies Divide the triumph. Southward one shall coast The midland sea through Egypt to Cyrene And on through Lybia to the Atlantic deep; Northward the other, from Illyria's shore To far Iberia's verge. From you I need Fully fifty thousand soldiers in three months: Your bravest. To subdue the West, and mould it, Demands three years: for these the queen is regent, Not more among my captains to rebate Envy's fell tooth, than in requital just Of royal gifts which I revere in her, Enough. Call in those Grecian embassies. [First enter the Envoys from the Greeks assembled at the Olympic games: the eldest speaks— King, and our lord, the Greeks with reverence true, Though not without misgiving, heard that edict But lately from Ecbatana sent to them, Remanding to their homes all Grecian exiles— Alex. Does Greece accept that ordinance? Envoys (with hesitation). Greece accepts. [Next, ambassadors from all the Greek States enter, habited like heralds deputed with offerings to temples. They advance to Alexander with golden crowns, and kneeling, lay them at his feet. The eldest speaks— To Alexander, Philip's conquering son, The States of Greece concede, unanimous, Honours divine, and hail him as a god. Scene IV.—Hanging Gardens at Babylon. Ptolemy, the Magian, Astar. Ast. War with the West! Your king has changed his purpose. Ptol. Sharp grief hath changed it. Grief, that should be gentle, To him is storm. Fiercely it bears him on Through Action's angriest skies. Ast. The king is strong: His eye is bright and keen, but glad no more: That iron Will still clutches its Hephestion. Ptol. The tyranny of love outlives its use. He loves Hephestion as of old. Not less His friend's benigner power—he's false to that: Hephestion was for peace: the royal mind Broods but on wars. Ast. His household life is past: His Persian wife, the sweetest of all ladies, And lordliest-souled, attends her widowed sister Far off. He'd have it so. Ptol. He destined first Ten years to moulding of the East— Ast. Ten years! These insect tribes beat quick their filmy wings, Live quickly, quickly die! Great Persia spent A hundred years knitting her realm in one: The spirit of Cyrus in her kings lived on: Cold airs from Median hills strengthened their arm: Our Magian sages—we too are from Media— Ordered alike religion and the state: Our nobles then were frugal, just, severe; They never shunned a foe, nor feared a truth: We conquered Asia's western half, and Egypt: Her idols knew it. But for Marathon— Ptol. I thought you of a temper more sedate: With us philosophy laughs passion down. Ast. Sir, truth that lives not militant on earth Traffics with falsehood in complicity, More false than she, as sinning against light. Our Faith was warlike while a heart was in it: So long we conquered. But a vanquished race Finds this revenge, its direst, and its last:— With poison of its vices it infects In time its conqueror's blood. 'Twas so with us: The lands we vanquished mixed our light with night: Then temples first confined our boundless worship; Then first with Oromasdes Zeus had part; Then first was weakness deemed a kingdom's wisdom, Promiscuous tolerance her maternal love;— I say they lied! 'Tis not a mother's arms That open are at all times, and to all! Ptol. Themes speculative these that end in heats: Our king, you see, moves on. Ast. Moves on! you err! I say his course is retrograde, not onward. This city's Babylon! Ptol. What then? Ast. The seat Of earth's first empire:—sordid 'twas, and base: Its gods were idols viler far than Egypt's, For hers concealed a meaning. Our great Xerxes Brought low the boastings of their brick-built tower Your king rebuilds it, fawns on Babylon, Would renovate a demon-haunted ruin: I have heard him laud Semiramis herself:— He heir of Cyrus! Ptol. Persian, have a care! You need our king. Ast. Greek! I have ne'er denied it: Ah, would I might! A realm's not wholly fallen Till this, the last dishonour, it has reached, To need its conqueror. This marriage blends us: I, that abhorred it, worked against it never; These hands were pressed upon that contract's seal. The effect? Look forth from those o'erhanging gardens! Far down, a priest-procession winds in pomp; Who are they? Magians? Greeks? Not so! Chaldæans! They hymn your king! Ptol. He loves not slaves: o'er earth He wills to build one Greece. Ast. He builds meanwhile The tomb of all the greatness earth can know, Gold-smeared without; within a heap of bones. “He wills to build one Greece!” Her kingdom's Thought: Greece must do penance ere she wins that kingdom, He drowns his Greece with gold: slays her with honours: He breeds a Greece to undo the work of Greece: He'll leave on earth nor honest ignorance, Nor knowledge just. He'll raise a pigmy race To mock dead Titans. From the highway dust He'll quicken with corruption's base conception Sophists in swarm. The locust-cloud will spread, And leave the world a waste. Ptol. Your augury's ill: The mind of Greece— Ast. The heart of Greece is rotten! That soil, whence intellect's root in darkness springs: 'Twas false to heaven; and now, malicious grown, Is false to nature. At their feasts I've heard them, Defend worse sin with dialectic leprous! I raised my head at last, and answered thus— Nations have vanished 'neath a conqueror's tread; Nations have perished, worn by civil strife; Nations have withered, famine-plagued: but Greece, The beautiful, the wise, the once heroic, Shall die in prime a suicide, nor leave, Amerced of household ties by fleshly shames, A child to inearth the corpse. An Attendant (entering). Sirs, be ye prompt! The royal barge approaches, Ast. (to Ptolemy). Join him thou! Philosopher of Greece, your lord lacks tendance! Scene V.—The Lake of Pallacopas, near Babylon. Alexander in the Royal Barge, attended by Artabazus, Seleucus, Antigonus, Peucestas, and others. Alex. Ten thousand men at break of day, Peucestas! The spot is there! we'll cut through yonder rock: O'er-pround Euphrates there shall find a channel— To work ere noon! Peu. It shall be ordered, sir. Sel. A mystery of sadness girds this region: Those trackless wastes, half water and half land, Those low-hung, hueless clouds above them streaming, The piping of the willow-bending wind, Upon the horizon far yon city-wall— Some curse is on this spot! Alex. Misrule's that curse: In ignorant kindness noxious as in hate: The country drowned, the city drained of waters— Old Xerxes did his work! Look well around: We need a fortress next, wherein to entrench The warders of our strait. I see a crag: Steer to its base. Art. A tomb it is of kings. Alex. Those slaves whom late we passed knee-deep in water With bloodshot eyes half blinded by the glare And light thin frames, were not of stock Chaldæan: Whence came they? Art. Sire, from Hierosolyma: The Assyrian razed their city, burned their Temple, To exile dragged them—greybeards, women, babes: In fifty years the Assyrian's empire fell: Cyrus, the Persian, loved that Hebrew people And loosed them from their bonds. Some few remained: Their progeny are those you marked but now. Alex. A vision rose before me as I watched them: I too have stood in Hierosolyma: My will was fixed to look on it once more: Chance, or some humour, on my way from Egypt— Near it I marched—made hindrance, and I passed. Art. Sir, you have shown much kindness to that people: A race that scarce can live, yet never dies: They are always ill at ease. Their ancient Law Forbade their task—rebuilding Belus' temple:— 'Tis six leagues off, yet there it rises plain: Your clemency vouchsafed a licit toil: They deepen yonder channel. Alex. Better thus: The Persians scorn the Assyrians, they, the Hebrews: Between the rival races, and their gods, I hold the balance just. What strain is that? The Persian and the Babylonian barges Since morn have followed mine with hymn, or chaunt: This has a different note. The Song. We sate beside the Babylonian river: Within the conqueror's bound, weeping we sate: We hung our harps upon the trees that quiver Above the onrushing waters desolate. A song they claimed—the men our task who meted— “A song of Sion sing us, exile band!” For song they sued, in pride around us seated: How can we sing it in the Stranger's land? Alex. That song's a dirge, with notes of anger in it: I hate the grief that nothing is save grief. Art. Sire, these are maidens of that Hebrew race. Sel. They have passed the osier banks. Once more that strain! The Song. If I forget thee, Salem, in thy sadness, May this right hand forget the harper's art! If I forget thee, Salem, in my gladness, My tongue dry up, and wither, like my heart! Daughter of Babylon, with misery wasted, Blest shall he be, the man who hears thy moans; Who gives thee back the cup that we have tasted; Who lifts thy babes, and hurls them on the stones! Alex. That race can boast a history. Search its annals! Sel. Our Grecian songs, for all their grace and light, Measured with such were as a wind-tossed tress Matched with yon sailing rack. Art. A galley comes— Those Babylonian braggarts make their revel. Chaldæan Song. Belus shall reign! Higher, each day, and higher Rises his temple. Crouch, pale Hebrew slave! Proud Persian lord, thy never-quenchèd fire Trembles like death-flames o'er a murderer's grave. Ashur, rejoice!— Alex. The ages pass, like winds; The old wrong remains, rooted like tombs and moves not: All may be done through Time; yet Time does nought. Let kings look well to that. We have reached our goal. Is that a tomb? Art. The Assyrian monarchs, sir, Squandered their lives in banquets, yet desired A solitary precinct for their graves: They reverenced Death:—the Greeks but deck and mock it. Those dusky crypts that pierce the sedge-girt rock, Are sepulchres of kings. [As Alexander turns, a gust blows his Causia into the water. The diadem that girdled it remains suspended on the reeds at the base of the tomb. A sailor plunges into the lake, and swims to the tomb, but, in his desire to keep the royal diadem dry, inadvertently sets it on his head. Thus crowned he re-enters the royal barge. A Sailor. The omen's ill! 2nd Sailor. The omen's black as night! Sel. (drawing his sword). I'll drown it in his blood! Alex. Give him a talent In guerdon for his bath and his good will, And, when we land, the scourge, to teach him manners. Omens! That priest Chaldæan spake of such: Passing this morn his city-gates, I laughed: I wore a cope of lead three months:—to-day I am stronger than at Tyre! Sel. May it please you, sir, The wind hath changed: we need three hours, or more, To reach the city. Alex. Mark that spot: 'tis there I build my fortress. Now to Babylon: haste! Drops fall apace: yon circlets on the mere Denote them heavy. Hark, a distant thunder! The heat is changed to cold. Our Artabazus Is old for summer drenchings. Art. Twenty years Press down my seventy. Sire, I should have passed Long since, yet may outlive the three years' child. Scene VI.—A Street in Babylon. Amyntas and Socrates. Amy. The royal throne was on the dais set: The generals' seats were ranged at either side: The Persian guard kept watch around the hall, Waiting earth's Master. Sudden, in the midst A Nubian stood—the meanest of his race; A moment more, and on that regal seat The ill-featured shadow sat. They dared not touch him: The throne makes holy all that rests thereon: They beat their breasts with wailing long and loud. The king arrived. Still sat that slave all calm With smile like that on idol faces vast Throned 'mid Egyptian sands. Soc. They stoned him, doubtless? Amy. The king forbade it. On the rack that slave Confessed no crime: confederates he had none; Was conscious of no purpose. Like a shaft Some inspiration from on high had pierced him; He pushed his spade into Euphrates' slime, He pushed his way into the royal palace, And round him stared, enthroned. The king said little: He took his place, and bade them hold debate. Now know you why, forth-issuing, men were pale; Why, here and there, in groups or pairs they whispered; Why hung that storm upon Seleucus' brow. Never hath royal throne endured this wrong That changed not owner soon. The king will die. Soc. A rush of citizens. Hark! Hark! they come! Citizens (hurrying past). The king is sick, they say! To the palace on! On! Scene VII.—The Palace at Babylon. Ante-room of the Royal Apartment. Antigonus, Ptolemy, Seleucus, Eumenes, Peucestas, Perdiccas, various Priests, and the Magian, Astar. Ptol. Sirs, know the truth: this sickness is to death: The king must die. Greek Priest. This thing I feared since first I marked him drifting from his native gods To alien—yea, to Belus. Per. Gods, sir priest, Grudge not each others' gains. To gods of Greece Each morn he offered duteous sacrifice, In sickness or in health. To foreign gods He was observant more, since gods less known Are formidable more than customed gods, Like-minded with ourselves. In this he erred— When certain Brahmins roused their king to war, Of that high race he crucified full six To awe the rest. That hour I feared! that hour No priest protested! Ant. Yea, and at Sangala, The city his already, he smote and slew Ten thousand warriors. I would give this head That deed had never been! Sel. Idiots! be mute!— This thing he did; that thing he left undone; Was born in such a year; in such was married; Why, lords, men speak as if our king were dead And they the embalmers, or the grave-diggers! He's sick. The tempest drenched him. Shall a shower Wash out the one great glory from the earth? We hid his sickness first: the secret's known: Since then, the world's gone mad. Chaldœan Priest. The strength of prayer Is his, and shall be. We Chaldæan priests Nor incense stint, nor victim. Greek Priest. Not a throne Brightens Olympus but our prayer hath beat it! Egyptian Priest. Serapis knows if we have prayed or not, He in whose image all the metals blend As all divinities are one in essence; Serapis knows. Sel. I see a Magian there: He stands, and speaks not: let the Magian speak. Ast. Sir, since the quenching of their Sacred Fire The Magian race stands silent. Be it so. A Royal Page (entering). The king has sent for Ptolemy. Scene VIII.—Alexander's Chamber. Alexander, Ptolemy. Alex. We're stayed in the midst. Ptol. Sire, may the mighty gods— Alex. I'm hindered of my own: my march is hindered! That march was ordered for the third day hence: This bends it to the fifth. Ptol. Too quickly pass— Alex. Thus much the malice of o'erweening gods, Or else their negligence, can fret our course! I'm maimed, and tamed, and shamed: but mind can act When the outward act is barred. Six audiences I have given. The chief of my Thessalian horse Had failed to impress his blacksmiths. Nehordates Had sent no corn to Opis. Ptol. Sire, your eyes Are blood—all blood. Where is it you feel the pain? Alex. I have wrestled oft with pain, and flung it ever: Save for that fire in brain, and heart, and hand, I am well enough. My strength as yet is whole. To work! You need the map. Despatch, this even, Heraclides to the Caspian, there to build A fleet for exploration: let him search If thence a passage lead not to the Euxine: That found, a six weeks' march were spared, and more, 'Twixt Hellespont and Indus. Ptol. One hour, my king, But one, give rest to that— Alex. Recall Nearchus! Command that he forbear those Arab pirates: Bid him through help of theirs—an army with him— Circle all Afric, reach the Atlantic Pillars: Thence, eastward curving on the midland sea, He'll meet, near Carthage, or that coast Italic, Our westward-marching host. You're staring, sir! Ptol. All shall be done. Alex. Ere sunset send to Egypt: We need a road to coast her sea. Her sands Are fire that blasts my eyes. Ptol. The brain o'er heated Recalls Gedrosia's waste. Alex. My brain's not touched: I watch it: if there rise beyond its verge A cloud, the slenderest, of bewildered thought, You'll learn it thus—I close my lips for ever. Ptol. Your thoughts are strong, my king, distinct, and plain. Alex. A light of conflagration makes them plain: 'Tis sent me from a pyre. Ptol. Immortal gods! Grant to this sufferer the balm of sleep! Alex. Sleep! Can you guard me 'gainst ill dreams in slumber? I'll tell you one. I died; and lay in death A century 'mid those dead Assyrian kings In their old tomb by yonder stagnant lake. Then came a trumpet-blast that might have waked, Methought, a sleeping world. It woke not them. I could not rise: I could not join the battle: Yet I saw all. Ptol. What saw you, sire? Alex. Twelve tents, Each with my standard. On twelve hills they stood Which either on their foreheads blazoned wore, Or from my spirit's instinct took, great names, Cithæron, Hæmus, Taurus, Libanus, Parapomisus, and huge Caucasus, With other five, and Athos in the midst. Then from my royal tents on those twelve hills, Mailed in mine arms, twelve Alexanders crowned With all their armies rushed into a plain Which quaked for fear, and dashed across twelve floods, Euphrates, Issus, Tigris, Indus, Oxus, And others with great names. They met — those Twelve— And, meeting, swelled in stature to the skies, And grappled, breast to breast, and fought, and died Save four that, bleeding, each on other stared, And leaned upon their swords. As thus they stood, Slow from that western heaven which domes the accursed— Rome's bandit brood—there moved a cloud night-black, Which, onward-gathering, mastered all the East, And o'er it rained a rain of fire. The earth Split, and the rivers twelve in darkness sank; The twelve great mountains crumbled to the plain; The bones of those twelve armies ceased from sight: Then from the sun that died, and dying moon, And stars death-sentenced, fell great drops of blood Large as their spheres, till all the earth was blood; And o'er that blood-sea rang a female cry, “The Royal House is dead.” Ptol. My king, my friend— Alex. Phylax is dust. You cannot bid him tend me! Ptol. Olympias, prescient, sent you, sire, from Greece But late its wisest leech. How oft you've said, “A mother's prayers are hard to be withstood!” Alex. I loved her in the old days: nor years, nor wars Disturbed that image. But a greater love In its great anguish tramples out all others. Impostors are they all—those heart-affections: They're dupes that make us dupes— There's not on earth a confidence unflawed: I think he kept from me at Tyre a secret Touching that princess. I from him concealed That warning strange at Hierosolyma, Whereof, it may be, my contempt more late When, old Parmenio doomed, I marched to India, Bore me ill fruit. Betwixt that warning strange And this, my sickness, was there aught in common? Ptol. It may be, sire, there was, Alex. Ere yet that darkness Hurled by injurious and malignant Fates Against this unsubverted head, had found me— The Fates that hustle heroes out of life; The Fates that hustled gods into the abyss; The unobsequious Fates that mock all things— In diligent musings at Ecbatana I thus resolved; to see once more that priest: Then came that death— And in the gloomy raptures of just wrath That mood went by. I marched to Babylon: Then came the end. Who sings? Ptol. Poor Hebrew slaves; They weed the palace court. The Song. Behold, He giveth His belovèd sleep, And they shall waken in a land of rest: Behold, He leadeth Israel like a sheep: His pasture is the mountain of the Blest. Blessed are they whose hands are pure from guilt; Who bore the yoke from childhood, yet are free: Jerusalem is as a city built Wherein the dwellers dwell in unity. Alex. That song's amiss. Ptol. Sire, for your army's sake, Which, like a wounded warrior, moans in sleep, Your Empire's sake, that, immature and weak, Is threatened in its cradle— Alex. 'Tis so: 'tis so: It lacks completion; and the years, the months, The hours, like ravening wolves that hunt a stag, Come up upon my haunches. Six o' the clock On the fifth morn! At noon we cross Euphrates: That hour you'll learn my plans: I'll cast this sickness from me, like the rags Flung from some lazar-house! Whose step is that? Ptol. Sire, there is none. Alex. Let not Seleucus near me! Those onsets of his blundering, blind devotion, So unlike his that perished— Ptol. Sire, none comes. Alex. Be strong! What shall be must. Shake not: bend nearer! I have a secret; one for thee alone: 'Twas not the mists from that morass disastrous, Nor death of him that died, nor adverse gods, Nor the Fates themselves; 'twas something mightier yet, And secreter in the great night, that slew me. [Seleucus enters. Welcome, Seleucus! Sel. Sire, I come unbidden: This Ptolemy—has Greece but one who loves you? Alex. Welcome, my brave Seleucus! In five days We march, at earliest dawn. A month shall find us Nighing old Egypt's coast. This scroll be yours: It is a code for Alexandria's rule: Therein I have made you lord. Till morn, farewell. [Seleucus departs reluctantly.I note you shaken, Ptolemy: learn thence Philosophy's a crutch for strength to play with: It mocks us when we're weak. On the fifth day— Farewell. [As Ptolemy is departing. Return. Your tablets—I would see them. Write down—the duty this of Eumenes— He cheats his tasks—write down my burial place. Likeliest you guess it. Ptol. Macedonian Pella? Old ties are strong. You said, when leaving Greece, “Pella, not Athens, if I die.” Alex. Not Pella. Ptol. This Babylon, where he you loved lies dead? Alex. 'Mid sands Egyptian—by the Ammonian grove— In my great Father's fane. Scene IX.—Ecbatana. Arsinoe (On a balcony of Drypetris' Palace). She sleeps. Thou blessed sleep that most dost bless us When we in thy great gift forget the gift, Oh, call us not ingrate! She sleeps: there's nought Like sleep to help a heavy heart; not music; That brings her back the memory of old times; Not love like mine; that whispers of another's; Not flowers nor song of birds, nor airs sweet-laden: If these poor flatteries force a smile upon her, Brief infidelity how soon avenged, The unwonted apparition leaves her dim; And those sad eyes make inquest without words, “Shall we no more behold him?” Silent stars That flash from yonder firmament serene, Ye have no portion in these pangs of earth; Ye mock not man with infirm sympathy: I thank you for your clear, unpitying brightness That freezes Time's deceits. The Lord of Light Sternly in you hath writ his four great Names Truth, Justice, Wisdom, Order. Ye endure: Our storms sweep o'er you but they shake you not: Darkness, your foe, but brings your hour of triumph: Your teaching is—to bear. The Lord of Light— Is it a woman's weakness that would wish him Another, tenderer name, the Lord of Love? A love that out of love created all things; A love that, warring ever, willeth peace; A patient love, from ill educing good; A conquering love, triumphant over death? Ah me! No land there is that clasps this Faith! To hold it were to feel from heaven a hand Laid on the aching breast of human kind, Laid on our own, and softer than the kiss Of some imagined babe. Come quickly, Death! Beyond thy gate is Truth. A Lady (entering). Madam, but now Your sister woke, and gently breathed your name, But slept ere I could answer. Ars. Watch beside her: When next she moves, make sign. Eternal Truth, Why has our Persia missed you? Truth she loved: She trained her sons in valour and in truth: And yet in vain for you our Magians strained Their night-dividing eyes! From sceptred watchers Turned she her all-pure countenance to reward More late some humbler vigil? It must be! The unceasing longing cannot be in vain: The agony of virtue crownless here, And great love sorrow-crowned. If earth can find, Indeed, no answer to her children's cry, Wandering from yon bright host a star will lead The lowliest of her wanderers, lowly and wise, In age still faithful to their childhood's longing, To where in some obscurest spot lies hid The saviour-soul of self-subsistent Truth, Some great world-conquering, world-delivering Might, The future's cradled Hope. The Lady (re-entering). Madam, she wakes. Scene X.—The Palace of Babylon. In the centre of the council hall is a pallet on which Alexander lies. The royal pages kneel at each side. Around, or in groups at the entrance, stand Eumenes, Cassander, Ptolemy, Amyntas, Socrates, Peucestas, Perdiccas, Seleucus, and other Generals. Ptol. It is a six days' journey: ere the noon That young, pale queen in far Ecbatana's palace Will break our seal, and read. Soc. (near the gate of the hall). The day draws near: The scared, wan dawn blends in yon cave of death With the red torch-light. Amy. Eight brief days ago That was a hall of council whence the world Waited her sentence. I could deem its air Was thick with phantom shapes. Is all hope lost? Soc. At midnight hope surceased. The fever sank; With it his strength. He bade them bear him hither: He speaks not since. Amy. In yon black palace lies The agèd queen! from window on to window The lights pass quick. There's sorrow there. 'Tis cold! Soc. You shake. Amy. They woke me sudden with the news. Ant. (entering). The Persian has his trouble as the Greek. Old Sisygambis sinks from hour to hour: She came from Susa hither, vexed by dreams, Found the king sick; foodless she sits since then Upon the palace floor. Dread gifts, men say, Of prophecy are hers. A funeral veil O'erhangs her glittering eyes and plaited forehead: Her Magians stand around: the royal children Kneel at her feet. Soc. In great Serapis' temple Four generals watched from early night to morn, Hoping some intimation from the god: Nor oracle nor vision was vouchsafed. At last Seleucus, kneeling at the shrine, Besought, “Shall the sick king, a suppliant, lay him Beneath the healing shadow of this fane?” 'Twas answered, “Where he lies, there let him bide.” Amy. That meant, that here abiding, he shall live. Ant. It meant, that death is better than to live. Ptol. (near the pallet). Seleucus, you were with him? Sel. Half the night My tears bedewed his hand. Ptol. Knew he things round him? Sel. He knew them well; and knew of things beyond. Long time he watched, or seemed to watch, the passions Of some great fight that makes a world or mars, And saw all lost. “Parmenio fought against me: 'Twas death's cold river gave him back his youth,” He muttered. Next he spake as to some priest: And seemed to grasp his wrist, and reasoned with him— I caught no word—two hours with lips foam-flecked, As one who proudly pleads, yet pleads for life; Then ceased, and slept. Eum. Keep silence at the gates! Ant. (drawing near). The soldiers will to see him. Ptol. Let it be: 'Tis now too late for aught to work him ill. [The soldiers stream in, circling successively the royal pallet, till the whole hall is thronged. Sel. The soldiers' friend! He hears their stifled moaning: His eye is following them; he fain would stretch His hand toward them! Eum. Speak to him, Ptolemy! Ptol. Sire, it is come! the king is king in death: Speak the king's ordinance. Who shall wear his crown? Alex. The worthiest head. [A long silence. Ptol. Once more his lips are moving: Perdiccas, you are keen of ear: bend low— Bend to his lips. Eum. His fingers move: he slides The royal ring into Perdiccas' hand. Ptol. Hear you no words? Per. I think he said, “Patroclus.” Ptol. Once more? Per. He said, “Achilles followed soon.” Ptol. Bend down once more. Per. He spake it plain: I heard it; “Patroclus died: Achilles followed soon.” Sel. And died in saying it. 'Tis past. He's gone! Ptol. The greatest spirit that ever trod this earth Has passed from earth. He, swifter than the morn O'er-rushed the globe. Expectant centuries Condensed themselves into a few brief years To work his will; and all the buried ages Summed their old wealth, to enrich, for man's behoof, With virtuous wisdom one Olympian mind Which, grappling all things — needing not experience— Yet scorned no diligence, the weapons shaped, Itself, that hewed its way, nor left to others The pettiest of those cares that, small themselves, Are rivets which make whole the mail of greatness. The world hath had its conquerors: one alone Conquered for weal of them who bowed beneath him, And in the vanquished found his firmest friends And passionatest mourners. The world hath had its kings: but one alone To whom a kingdom meant a radiant fabric, No tyrant's dungeon-keep, no merchant's mart, But all intelligential, so combining All interests, aspirations, efforts, aims, That man's great mind, therein made one o'er earth, Might show all knowledge in its boundless glass, As the sea shows the sun. Rough Macedon, Boast; yet be just! Thou wert this wonder's nurse: A mightier was his mother. Earth, take back Thy chief of sons! Henceforth his tomb art thou. Sel. Lords, he is gone who made us what we are; And we, remanded to our nothingness, Have that, not words, to offer him for praise. There stand among us some that watched his boyhood; They have had their wish; he lived his life. The gods, Feared they the next step of their earthly rival, Who pressed so near their thrones? Your pardon, lords! He's dead who should this day have praised the dead, Happiest in this, he died before his friend. Lords, we have lived in festival till now, And knew it not. The approaching woes, they best Shall measure greatness gone. The men who 'scape, Building new fortunes on the wreck-strewn shore, Shall to their children speak in life's sad eve Of him who made its morning. Let them tell His deeds but half, or no man will believe them: It may be they will scarce themselves believe, Deeming the past a dream. That hour, their tears Down-streaming unashamed like tears in sleep Will better their poor words: who hear shall cry. Pale with strong faith, “There lived an Alexander.” [A passage opens in the crowd, and Astar stands up beside the body of Alexander. Ast. Conquerors of Persia, now yourselves death-conquered, Another royal corse makes dumb the world. The mother of Darius, Sisygambis, As o'er the horizon's verge the rising sun Lifted its Persia-worshipped forehead, dropped Her brow discrowned down on the dust, and died. Ptol. Empire o'er empire topples: Persia first Above her, she that vanquished Persia—Greece. ST. THOMAS OF CANTERBURY. TO THE GREAT MEMORY OF CARDINAL FISHER AND SIR THOMAS MORE. DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. ENGLISH.

Beyond is a crowd waiting outside the Abbey, within which the monks of St. Augustine's at Canterbury have just made election of Thomas à Becket to the Primacy. Her. Augustine's chair! The greatest that which England Can yield her greatest—save a happy death. Thomas can stand the trial. Praise to God! The man I love stands honoured. John of Sal. England's honoured! Thomas is English wholly—Saxon half; A scion of that ancient, healthful stock Which fell on Hastings' field; first English-born Who for five reigns hath swayed Augustine's staff. King Harold, have thy joy! Leic. Our king is wise; King Henry, of that name the first, espoused A daughter of the Saxon line, Matilda, That English blood with Norman mixed thenceforth Might comfort English hearts. King Henry's grandson Walks in his grandsire's steps. Corn. With better luck, Pray God! than Beauclerk's—the Investitures;— Anselm, the primate, fought that battle hard, Stretching from exile a lean, threatening arm, And won it more than half. At Bec he lies, Or England ne'er had slept. I think he sleeps not; I think that in his grave the stern old monk, Who looked so meek and mild, keeps vigil still, Muttering of simony and sins of princes. The king did well to choose a citizen's son: 'Tis that which makes this brutish city loud; Yet safer far had been a humbler choice— Becket hath Norman blood. Leic. What matters that? Norman and Saxon daily blend in England: The king is neither. Sir, he's Angevine: His faithfullest subjects we; not less we know him Of alien race, an alien emperor Who counts our England one 'mid subject realms, And seldom sees her face. Remember, Cornwall, That, when that earlier Henry sware, new-crowned, To grant this land once more the laws of Alfred, Not Saxon churl alone desired the boon, But Norman knight no less. Forget not this: Matilda—how unlike her empress-daughter!— Was saint with either race, and won her lord To hold his parliaments. The king and she Walked side by side when Alfred's bones were moved From Newminster to Hyde. Corn. 'Tis true; this Becket Shares not the scandal of that foreign brood Which swarms through all the realm's great offices; Preys on our lands. A Norman was his sire; Some say his mother was an Asian princess, Who loved that father chained in Holy Land, Loosed him, and with him fled. Leic. Likelier I deem it She cut her flaxen Saxon tresses short, And followed him to Syria, garbed a page, With cross upon her shoulder, and a heart Made strong by maiden love. John of Sal. Brave legends both! They mean that Becket's great. Whate'er hath greatness Kindles some glittering legend round its way Through the gross ether of the popular mind. Becket's a man! Corn. A merchant's son—not noble! John of Sal. Patriarch is he of nobles, not their son— The nobles 'mid the shepherds of Christ's flock: Let that suffice. Leic. Whate'er his race, 'twas merit Raised Becket's head. But three months chancellor, He scourged those boors of Flanders from the realm; Shook down the bandits' towers above the builders: So plainly his desert shone forth, that Envy Bit her own tongue reviling him. Great knights Flocked to his standard; sons of nobles stood His pages in the splendour of his halls. His ways were royal: when he crossed the seas To vindicate 'gainst France our England's name, Six ships of his own building with him sailed, And sixteen hundred warriors ate his bread; The chivalry of Aquitaine and Anjou, Of Scotland, Brittany, yea, England's self, Stared at the steel-mailed cleric. Her. Sir, a deacon— A deacon only, not a priest. Leic. Once more I see that French knight, Engelramme de Trie, Upon the red field rolling— [Gilbert Foliot, attended by John of Oxford, issues from the Abbey. Corn. Hush! here's Gilbert— I hate that sallow face and inward eye— And, with him, John of Oxford, courtier-priest, That, round and ready, slips and slides through all things, And ever upward works. Leicester, come hence! To Rouen next: we'll bring the king the tidings. [Cornwall and Leicester depart. Gil. A cure miraculous, John, the king has worked; Touches a soldier, and a bishop rises! The hand that cures the evil gives the staff! John of Oxf. My lord, the staff is given; the evil, long, Transferred not cured, shall plague the heart of England. Gil. I note in yonder man a strength resistless; A strength for ill. In washing of the dirt From off the Church, he'll wash the Church to nothing. I preached against her sins: there were who said I bit them hard; he'll rend away the rags With shreds of flesh adhering. Next, he'll loose The spiritual body from the secular clutch;— Let princes look to that. John of Oxf. Becket lacks patience; Victory half won, he'll dash himself to death. Gil. There's in him strength to wrest from death itself Victory stone-cold. I go: abide and watch! [Gilbert passes on. 1st Man-at-arms. If they deceive the great, they deceive not the simple. Gilbert is twice Roger's height, and but half his bulk; yet it is envy, not his fasts, that wasteth him. Though he is mortified, yet he is sycophant. If the king bade him eat a babe new baptized, he would eat it for its soul's sake, and say grace. 2nd Man-at-arms. To hear them talk—the nobles and the priests—each finding a reason for the promotion of Thomas! I know the reason, for I was there. When our king and the French king were last at war, the longer each looked at his brother the uglier he thought him. Then was devised this counsel—to marry together their two children, our Prince Henry, then five years old, and their Princess Marguerite, three only. Thomas, being lord chancellor, was sent to Paris to fetch home the bride. There stood I that day, and gave glory to God. 1st Man-at-arms. What saw you? 2nd Man-at-arms. Of his own household there were two hundred—clerics and knights—chanting hymns. Then followed his hounds—ten couples. Next came eight waggons with five horses each, and each bearing eight casks of wine. After them followed lesser waggons: the first bare the chancellor's wardrobe, the second his pantry, the third his kitchen, the fourth the furniture for his chapel; the fifth his books, his gold plate, and infinite silver crowns. Under every waggon there walked an English mastiff, bound. Then followed twelve sumpterhorses. The esquires bare the shields, and the falconers the hawks on their fists; after them came those that held the banners; and last, my lord on a milk-white horse. Princesses gazed from the windows, and nuns peered through their grates: and they of France muttered as he passed, ‘If this be England's chancellor, what is her king?’ Thomas gave gifts to all—to the princes, and the clergy, and the knights, and to the poor more than to the rich— to one a palfrey, and to one a gold brooch, and to one a jewel. When he feasted the beggars, he bade them take with them the gilded spoons, and the goblets; and the dish of eels which my lord supped on that night cost a hundred marks! God honoured him because he loved the poor; and I knew he would be exalted! [They pass on. Scene II.—A House in London. Becket, Herbert of Bosham. Bec. A heavy weight, good Herbert, and a sudden! Her. My lord, it came from heaven; what need we more? Who sent the weight will send the strength. That bard Whose Trojan legend was the old world's Bible Clothed his best Greek with armour from the gods, And o'er the field it bore him like a wind. What meant that armour? Duty! O my lord, The airy gauds that deck us, these depress us: The divine burthen and the weight from God Uplift us and sustain. Bec. Herbert! my Herbert! High visions, mine in youth, upbraid me now: I dreamed of sanctities redeemed from shame; Abuses crushed; all sacred offices Reserved for spotless hands. Again I see them; I see God's realm so bright each English home Sharing that glory basks amid its peace; I see the clear flame on the poor man's hearth From God's own altar lit; the angelic childhood; The chaste, strong youth; the reverence of white hairs:— 'Tis this Religion means. O Herbert! Herbert! We must secure her this! Her rights, the lowest Shall in my hand be safe. I will not suffer The pettiest stone in castle, grange, or mill, The humblest clod of English earth, one time A fief of my great mother, Canterbury, To rest a caitiff's booty. Herbert, Herbert, Had I foreseen, with what a vigilant care Had I built up my soul! The fall from greatness Had tried me less severely. Many a time I said, ‘From follies of these courts and camps Reverse will scourge me homeward to my God; He'll ne'er forego me till I grow to Christian!’ Lo! greatness comes, not judgment. Her. It may be That God hath sent you both in one. Fear nought! At Paris first, and after at Bologna, You learned the Church's lore. Bec. I can be this, The watch-dog keeping safe his master's door Though knowing but little of the stores within: I'll do my best to learn. Give we, each day, Six hours to sacred studies! Ah! you smile; You note once more the boaster. Friend, 'tis true, Our penitence itself doth need repentance; Our humbleness hath in it blots of pride. Hark to that truant's song! We celibates Are strangely captured by this love of children Nature's revenge—say, rather, compensation. The king will take him hence: God's will be done! I lose my pupil, and become your pupil; A humble one; no more. High saint of God, or doctor of the Church, 'Twere late for that; yet something still remains: I ever wished to live an honest man, Honest to all, and most to Christ, my Master. Help me to be His servant true! Her. I promise. Bec. Henceforth I cast all worldly pomps aside: The king must find some worthier chancellor: It irks me thus to slight his gifts; yet John Who journeys with the prince must bear to France This realm's Great Seal. Her. Bid John to teach his charge, He'll need it when a king, humility. When first I saw the prince 'twas on his birthday: Songs rang, and banners waved: the child was glad And tossed his head in triumph. Thus I warned him: ‘Child, walk less proudly! He who fashioned man Fashioned yon worm; and when the man lies dead The worm consumes his flesh!’ ‘My flesh,’ he cried With flashing eyes, ‘My flesh—the King of England's!— I'd treat them thus! ’and thrice on the green turf Down stamped his little crimson boot. He comes! How clear his voice! [Prince Henry enters. Bec. The swallow, little prince, Can twitter though he sings not: so can you That, like the swallow, with you waft the spring, P. Hen. Better his twitter than the organ's growl: Vespers are done; that's well! Bec. They say, my child, Those Canterbury monks have made me primate; I little like the charge. P. Hen. Why take it then? I spurned this day a shoe though wrought in pearl, Because it galled me; ay, and left some red Upon the maker's cheek! The chancellor's gown Was gayer thrice than that. You have changed for worse! Bec. High place hath many foes. P. Hen. When father dies I shall be king: that day I'll find and slay them! Bec. Child, love you not your father? P. Hen. Lo! you frown I love my father, but I love you better: Not oft he speaks to me, nor then with smiles: He knows no pretty tales of birds and beasts; He never lays his hand upon my head; Hard are his questions; ere the answer comes He sits in thought, or leaves me. Bec. Little prince, It may be when the cloud is on his brow His thought is for his son! Know you not, Henry, A father's heart is with his babes? For them He toils all day; for them keeps watch by night; Risks oft his soul itself. See you this letter? It bids me send you home. We part at sunrise. P. Hen. I will not go! I'll stay with you in London!— Hark, hark, the light hoofs dancing in the court: Long-maned, large-eyed, a white star on his front: They said he was so gentle I could ride him: I answered I would ride him mild or wild. Father, farewell! [Rushes out followed by Herbert. Bec. Farewell, light heart! Man's life Loses its speciousness: remains but Duty. (After a long pause) Herbert, and John—how wise is each; how true! How few have friends like these: yet something tells me That neither will be near me when I die. Scene III.—Palace at Rouen. King Henry, Queen Eleanor, the Bishop of Lisieux, Cornwall, Reginald Fitz-Urse, Courtiers, Minstrels, Attendants. K. Hen. Three victories in three realms had pleased me less! This day my ten years' purpose stands fulfilled: Those monks have given consent! Thomas Archbishop— That hand which holds the seal wielding the staff,— The feud of Crown and Church past for ever. My chancellor made primate, Henry of Blois Shall bend from his stiff back! Q. Elea. Have joy, good husband! The gift of faith is yours! K. Hen. You trust in none; I, trusting few, trust Thomas; I have proved him. Those sins my youth had not the grace to shun At least it scorned to vindicate. Who chid them? Nor knight, nor bishop; he and he alone! You slight your one true friend. Q. Elea. Hear that, fair ladies! A spouse unfaithfuller— K. Hen. Henceforth I rule! None shares with me my realm. My Lord of Lisieux, Should not a king be king? Lis. May it please your Highness, 'Tis known I never walked with them that err From duty to their king. Yet kings, forgive me, Armed with that twofold power your Highness boasts, Shall need a sage's prudence. K. Hen. Have no fear! That twofold sway my own, the world shall wonder Less at its greatness than the temperance meek Wherewith I wield its functions. Lis. Sire, 'tis thus Your Church shall serve you best. The garden dial No doubt is appanage of the garden's lord; Yet he who wills to plant it at incline And he who scans it by the torch he carries Know not the hour o' the day. K. Hen. My kingdom's bishops Shall keep full power to mulct ill clerks; and Rome, Albeit reduced, retain her vantage-place— The loftiest tassel on the Church's cap. Q. Elea. What cap is that? In Guienne some would answer, ‘A fool's cap on a palsy-stricken head— —’ O, 'tis a beauteous and a beaming land! I ever hated Paris! There that monk, Bernard, held sway; but in my sunny South, Strong as the North in arms and wiser thrice, 'Twas banquet still, and song. ‘Mysteries’ and ‘plays’ Alternate graced our halls. Gay Troubadours! Amid our ‘Courts of Love’ I judged the prize— They sware my song was best! K. Hen. Rise, Southern sea, And drown for aye that sun-burnt land of ‘Oc!’ An oak-wood of the North were worth it all! Your Troubadours have but one song among them, And that's the grasshopper's! Their garrulous land Scorns kings as much as priests! Your grandfather In spleen forsook it, lived in Spain, cave-roofed, The knightly armour hid by hermit weeds, And, worn by penance, died. Q. Elea. A priestly legend! He revelled to the last and died in sleep: Heaven grant us all such end! I tell you, Henry, My land's a land of mind yet more than mirth: There are who whisper there that marriage vows, Like vows monastic, mean but cleric gain;— Poor Petronilla! Rodolf loved her well: What marred that love? A dotard Pope, preferring To theirs the claim of Rodolf's beldam wife Espoused in ignorant youth! K. Hen. You fought their fight; And thirteen hundred boors were burnt, they say, In Vitry's church, when Vitry fell. Q. Elea. Which error We cancelled fighting in the Holy Land. O, what a clime! What flowers, what fruits, what odours! What stars, clear-imaged in those Asian streams Whose coldest ripple wafts an amorous tune: That land hath but one blot—Jerusalem! A city like a nightmare, legend-choked; Black den of Saints! K. Hen. Your ‘Amazons’ and you, Whose quaint apparel wonder-struck the world, Ended, ere long, I think, that high crusade. Q. Elea. When captains shape their march to please a lady, The shame is theirs, not hers. 'Twas frolic all, And so in frolic died. K. Hen. A frolic! woman! My earliest dream was of some great crusade; That work shall yet be mine, my last, my chief: Ay, but I'll build my empire first! That done, My brave and loyal sons shall share my toils, Or guard my realms at home. Q. Elea. How chill 'tis grown! Swift Southern springs, that with a flame of flowers In one day light the earth, how unlike you This tardy Norman May! See those poor monkeys! Despite their coats of scarlet and of gold They shake from ear to tail. Fitz-Urse, some music! Fitz-Urse. Madam, there stands a Trouvère! Q. Elea. Let him sing. Minstrel, what poems make you? Trou. Please your Highness, The proud old pagan poets made their songs; We Trouvères find, not make them, deeming earth God's poem, beauty-stored. Q. Elea. Then find me one. (Trouvère sings.) I make not songs, but only find; Love following still the circling sun His carol casts on every wind, And other singer is there none. I follow Love, though far he flies; I sing his song, at random found Like plume some bird of Paradise Drops, passing, on our dusky bound. In some, methinks, at times there glows The passion of some heavenlier sphere: These too I sing; but sweetest those I dare not sing, and faintly hear. Q. Elea. That's psalm, not song! Sing me some love-song old, Of Grecian gods and nymphs. Trou. On Grecian hills Traditionary melodies survive Pagan, yet touched in part by tenderer feeling: I know one—‘Phœbus and the Doe.’ Q. Elea. Sing that. (Trouvère sings.) Phœbus paced the wooded mountains; These stanzas are in part taken from a Romaic poem, one of the ‘Robber songs’ sung for centuries by the bandits, more properly called ‘outlaws,’ on the mountains of Greece. The mingling of Greek mythology with a sentiment tenderer than that which commonly belonged to the poetry engendered by that mythology in Pagan times, is interesting. Kindled dawn, and met a doe; ‘Child, what ails thee that thou rovest O'er my bright hills sad and slow? ‘That upon thy left side only Thou thy noontide sleep dost take; That thy foot the fountain troubles Ever ere thy thirst thou slake?’ Answered thus the weeping creature: ‘Once beside me raced a fawn; Seest her, O thou God all-seeing! O'er thy hills, in wood or lawn? ‘On my left side sleep I only, For 'tis there my anguish stirs; And my foot the fountain troubles, Lest it yield me shape like hers.’ —Then the Sun-God marvelled, musing, ‘When my foolish Daphne died, Rooted 'mid Peneian laurels, Scarce one little hour I sighed.’ Q. Elea. A love-song that! An icicle it is Added to winter! Phœbus was a fool Else had he captured Daphne ere she rooted; Your doe a fool to weep for gladness past. What says King Henry? De Tracy (entering). May it please your Highness, Four priests are come, sent by my lord the primate, With letters and a casket. K. Hen. Bid them enter. Thomas has sent some offering! [John of Salisbury enters, followed by three abbots. Q. Elea. (to one of her ladies). Lo, their saint! Large fame is his, and long I craved to see him: Princely he is, but lacks the princely pride; Rather some prince's phantom, gaunt and wan; Methinks that moon which maddens him looks through him! Saint he is none! his countenance is not humble. [John of Salisbury presents a letter to the king. K. Hen. The casket first! Belike a crown im perial! Q. Elea. Not so! A diamond necklace; and for me! [She tears open the casket, out of which rolls the Great Seal of England. John of Sal. This missive, sovereign liege, humbly sets forth Those forceful, yet unwelcome counter-duties, The exigence whereof compelled my lord— K. Hen. To hurl at England's head England's Great Seal! At last I know him! Traitor! [He tears up the letter, and flings it on the fire. Burn unread, Foul web of lies! Thou too, England's Great Seal, Once type of justice and of law, this day Spurned from the traitor's clutch that long defiled thee! Dishonour's badge! poor clod of kneaded vileness! I crush thee 'neath my feet! [He tramples on the Great Seal. John of Sal. May it please your Highness— K. Hen. Hence, lest I strike thee and thy fellows dead! O sharp-toothed worm! this heart it was that nursed thee; Lo, thou hast gnawed thy passage to the day! Base churl, thou show'st at last thine English breed And king-defying fierceness. Vengeance! Vengeance! 'Twas with a smile he said our love was past: He'll find my hate begun. Cornwall! Fitz-Urse! This night to England: stay the consecration! Say that my will is changed. Scene IV.—London; House of the Chief Justiciary. Richard de Luci, Cornwall. Corn. It was untoward, my lord, though done in duty: The king is much in wrath. De Luci. His choice made wroth Augustine's monks: they love no seculars, Yet, hating Roger more, and Gilbert more, Though jealous for a right so oft impugned Elected Thomas. Thomas sought not greatness: But late I stood beside him and the king At Falaise, in a window which o'erlooks The pleasant Norman plains: the king turned sharp, And caught him by the arm, and spake, ‘Get hence! Old Theobald is dead: fill thou his seat:’ The chancellor smiled, and, lifting his gay sleeve, Replied, ‘A saintly man your Highness seats Upon Augustine's chair;’ then added, sad, ‘Forbid it, heaven! One month, and love, long tried, Would change to new-born hatred: royal needs Prey on Church rights!’ On me King Henry looked— ‘Richard, if on my bier I lay, stone-cold, Say, wouldst thou throne my son?’ I answered ‘Yea;’ Then he, ‘Thus throne my friend at Canterbury!’ Corn. The king is changed. 'Tis true he loved this Becket; But more he trusted Becket's love for him And for his royal pupil, young Prince Henry. My lord, King Stephen, pressed by rivals, bowed The sceptre to the crosier. Not so Henry! He, in the purple born, from his great mother The Empress Maude, inherited by right Both Normandy and Maine, and from his sire Touraine and Anjou. Next, with Eleanor He wedded Poitou, Limousin, Auvergne Saintonge, and Perigord, and Angoumois And Guienne's vine-clad plains. King Stephen died: England was his, and with it Europe's coasts From Scottish shores to mountains of Navarre: Shall this man be the beadsman of the Pope? Creedsman suffices! De Broc (entering abruptly). God preserve your lordship! De Luci. Sir, you are welcome. Becket for the primate— Corn. So, so! you fetch me back: I had slipped my tether: The king will have his Royal Customs rule, Not Saxon laws, priest-hatched. His chancellor primate He deemed his right secure; that dream is past: Becket is chancellor no more. De Luci. That's ill! I ever marked an inner man in Thomas That stirred within the outer. Such men burst Their bond or soon or late. Corn. The king misdoubts him, And, till his will be signified, forbids The consecration rite. De Luci. The election's made; And, being made in form, no law annuls it. De Broc. Then take him like a dog and hang him up! That done, I find just reason. De Luci. Sir, you stand In presence of this realm's Justiciary, Who knows alike to vindicate old laws And pluck from fraud its mask of loyal zeal. You came unbidden; waste not time on us If tasks are yours elsewhere. De Broc. One task is mine— To slay the man I hate; and I will slay him! [Departs. De Luci. The air grows healthier now De Broc has left us: That man's a forest-beast no art can tame. Three times my hand with iron mace of law Hath spurned him to his den. His history doubtless You know not, late returned from Aquitaine. In youth his bad heart was a nest of adders, Envenomed purposes and blind at war: A monk, on false pretence he broke his vows, And roamed a-preying on the race of man. Idonea next he met— Corn. Idonea? De Luci. Her— The sweetest blossom lit by English skies, The tenderest of de Lisle's old stem. He met her, And loved her with the malice of that love Whose instinct is a craving less to enjoy Than kill the saintly grace it yet admires; Likewise the upstart loved her wealthy lands. A prince had vainly woed her! From her childhood The orphan in her brother lived; he died: Like some young widow moonlight-pale, three years, Daily she decked his grave. Corn. He could not win her? De Luci. She lived a royal ward. De Broc with bribes Won certain near the king, Fitz-Urse, De Tracy, To speed his wooing of the virgin-heiress. Large nets he spread. Once, well-night trapped, she sought The friend of her dead mother, Becket's sister, His dearest upon earth. That great man's name Since then protects Idonea; for which cause, Poisoned beside by sin's insane suspicions, De Broc has vowed revenge. Enough of this: The king chose ill in Thomas. Corn. Whom would you choose? De Luci. Not York! no worldly bishop! Poor sick world, Methinks thy leech, the Church, hath caught thy fever! Corn. There's Gilbert! De Luci. Fanatic of old, and late With courtier over-slimed. Sleekness like his Sophisticates, not lulls, the fight before us, Makes slippery too the athlete's wrestling-floor. I note in every country at this hour A warfare 'twixt the men of mind and might, The crosier and the sword; these two are kingdoms In every kingdom front to front opposed, Yet needing each the other. Corn. Up, good sword, And strike the crosier down! De Luci. Cornwall, that cry Hath in it more of courtier than of statesman: The crosier down, justice were driven from earth And chaos come again. Corn. Winton last week Ordained a serf of mine! That serf is free! Grant us the presentations at the least! Shear we the shepherds; shear who will the sheep. Sir, we attend the king at heavy charge: Nobles must live! I say the Church is proud; Clamours for freedom. De Luci. I was ne'er of those Who deem church freedom but a maniac's knife Threatening that maniac's throat. Be hers her freedom: Let kings reduce her pride. King Stephen's brother, Henry of Winton, loves both Church and State, Plots not with bishops, fawns not upon kings, But higher sits than either, seeking nought. Legate he was; hath stood too near to popes And monarchs both, to find a god in either: Whichever wrongs the other he withstands: I love that bishop well; if rich, he's bounteous; Rides with a prince's retinue;—what then? The people love him better for his pride, Birth's honest pride, how different from the pride Of upstart intellect, or of spiritual spleen! Compared with these 'tis innocent; 'tis child-like; 'Tis but a loftier terrace whence to bend More humbly to the humble. Corn. Winton primate, All had gone well! De Luci. Save to the scaffold's height King Henry ne'er had raised King Stephen's brother. Scene V.—The Western Entrance to the Cathedral of Canterbury. A multitude of clerics and others stand around watching the advance of Becket, preceded by a procession of nobles, abbots, and bishops. John of Salisbury and Herbert of Bosham converse alone. John of Sal. Since came to him this greatness he is sad; He fears the election was not wholly free. Her. He fears far more than that. When Canterbury's towers looked on us first O'er the great woodlands, thus he spake: ‘Last night By me there stood a Venerable Form And gave me talents ten;’ then added low, ‘See that thou sift my faults with flail and fan: I count thee traitor else.’ I made my vow That hour. It shall be kept. John of Sal. They pass the gate: Thomas walks last, and by his side the prince, Holding his hand full fast. That child well loves him; A word 'gainst Becket, and his face heaven-bright Clouds with his father's frown! A French Priest (addressing an English Priest). What twain are those that entered late and stand Within the western portals? Name him first, That tall ascetic form with presence kingly, Kingly in kingships of some spiritual sphere, And fearless port self-stayed, and dominant eye? English Priest. That's John of Salisbury, Becket's counsellor chief, Wisest, men say, in England. French Priest. Who is he Close by, that gazes through those portals, he With countenance vision-dazed, low stature, form Slight as a maid's and modest? Such a one Could he but slip unmarked through gates of heaven, Might undetected walk 'mid virgin choirs 'Twixt Agatha and Agnes. English Priest. That is Herbert, Becket's chief friend. But lo, my lord himself! [The procession advances to the high altar, before which sits Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winton. The monks of St. Augustine's Monastery stand in a semicircle around him. The bishops take their seats in two rows below him, in front of the altar; the abbots sit, and the nobles stand behind them. Leic. (apart to De Luci). My lord of Winton consecrates the primate; The king will like not that. De Luci. It shall bestead him. My lord of York made claim, and Hereford, And some Welsh bishop, oldest in the land, Who butts against Pelagius in his dreams And thinks him living yet. I spake with Winton: Becket he loves—except when others praise him;— And this day will in grave discourse exhort To walk in modesty of virtue, taming Man's pride of flesh, and please our lord the king. The B. of Roch. (addressing the Bishop of Winton). Most reverend lord, through me the Church presents, For consecration to a bishop's order, The archiepiscopal degree, and throne Primatial of the total realm of England, Thomas, a presbyter of life approved. Henry of Win. Was this election free? Prior of St. Aug. My lord, 'twas free. Henry of Win. It resteth with the bishops of the province To ratify the election, or annul. What sentence make my lords? Gil. My lord, our voices Unanimous approve—the loudest mine. Henry of Win. My lords, this work, we trust, is work of God; Not less, where things of heaven commix with earthly, A creeping wariness perforce hath place 'Mid duties more sublime. This hour mine eye Rests on a youth who to the heart of England That most in innocency seeth God, Presenteth ever comfort of her hope And to this Church good auspice. Here he stands To answer for his father. Royal sir, This man, elect to Canterbury's chair, Hath long time lived the realm's high chancellor; Dispensed her offices; held in his hand Her treasury's golden key. A man so trusted Hath enemies. For that cause we demand That Thomas to the Church be given absolved From every claim foregone, just or unjust, Derived from functions past; henceforth for aye A free man, with a spirit's freedom ranging Among the things of God. P. Hen. My Lord of Winton, And you, my lords, England's great prelacy In apostolic synod this day met, Though young, I stand commissioned by my sire, And, acting in his name, and by his will, Concede that just demand. Henry of Win. Son, read the oath. Becket (reads the oath of a bishop aloud, and ends). May God so help me, and His holy Gospels! Henry of Win. Son, it behoves a bishop of Christ's Church To make confession of her faith and morals: Believest thou one God in Persons Three, The Incarnation of the Second Person, And, through His death, redemption? Bec. I believe. Henry of Win. Wilt thou bear witness to the sacred Scriptures And sage traditions of past times? Bec. I will. Henry of Win. Wilt thou to Peter, and that kingly line Long-linked with his, which wields the keys of heaven, Be liegeful and of constant heart? Bec. I will. Henry of Win. Wilt thou in chastity and lowness live, With spirit averse to worldly greed? Bec. I will. Henry of Win. Wilt thou be gracious to the poor of Christ? Bec. I will. Henry of Win. God give thee increase of thy faith, And good resolve, to blessedness eternal! [The assistant bishops conduct Becket to a side chapel. After a short time they lead him back, wearing sandals, the pectoral cross, the stole, tunicle, dalmatic, and maniple. Passing the altar of St. Benedict, he kneels and prays. The Litanies are then sung, the bishops and other assistants kneeling, while Becket lies on his face before the high altar. The Litanies ended, he kneels while the assistant bishops, solemnly opening the Book of the Gospels, rest it upon his neck and shoulders. After this they lay their hands on his head, saying, ‘Accipe Spiritum Sanctum,’ while the Veni Creator Spiritus is sung. The Bishop of Winton then, first slowly making the sign of the cross over Becket's head, anoints it with the holy chrism, while two choirs, one at the high altar, and one in the chapel of St. Benedict, sing alternately the verses of the Antiphon, Sicut unguentum in capite. Henry of Win. Eternal King, and Kingly Priest on high, Whose virtue makes the worlds for ever young, Send forth upon the head of this Thy priest Thy heavenly grace. In stillness let it creep Down to the utmost parts invisible Of spirit and of soul. Sustain in him True faith, true love. Make beautiful his feet And wingèd on Thy mountain-tops, forth speeding Thy herald with Thy Gospel for mankind: Be his to preach it, not by craft of men But demonstration of Thy Spirit divine, In word and work. Grant him in right and might To wield Thy keys; and what he binds on earth Bind Thou in heaven. Thy blessing send on them That bless him, and Thy ban on them that curse: Let him not put the evil for the good, Darkness for light. Fear he the face of none. Be Thou his strength, that mightily he rule Thy Church in this Thy realm, and save Thy people. [The Bishop of Winton then blesses the pastoral staff and the ring, and delivers them to Becket, as well as the Book of the Gospels, closed, and finally gives him the kiss of peace, which last the assistant bishops likewise reverently bestow. De Luci (apart to Leicester). My lord will preach. Draw near! Leic. Some eight years since Our coronation feast at Westminster Showed us a pomp more rich. That day the prelates In divers-coloured silks so shone that still, Move where they might past gloomiest arch or aisle, They wove a varying rainbow such as braids The dark skirts of a cloud. De Luci. And cloud and storm That lovely light portended. 'Twas the queen Who changed our graver splendours of the West That day to plumage of the Eastern Church: She loves the loud and bright. The Grecian rites In that schismatic seat of Constantine Had charmed her wild and wandering eye. Leic. Lo there! Henry of Win. (placing the mitre on Becket's head). The helmet of salvation gird the head Of God's high warrior! from its horns forth shine The glories twinned of either Testament! Auspicious beam they as from Moses' face That light of God. Be they His people's strength, And terrible to those who hate the truth. Her. (to John of Salisbury, still near the western entrance). I catch no word. John of Sal. The man who takes his stand Hard by a torrent hears no sound beside: Beyond that gate a torrent people streams— Her. Streams like the world, and all its blind confusions; Within, behold the vision of God's peace! Between these twain we stand. John of Sal. The rite's complete: The primate kneels for blessing. Her. Ha! What means it? A Consecrator blesses from his chair; And none is loyal more to forms than Winton. Why stands he thus with hands to heaven upheld, His white head shining like a sun new-risen Through wintry mist dim seen? John of Sal. At last he speaks! Her. Not loud:—and yet we hear him, oh how clearly! Henry of Win. This day the Spirit Prophetic on me falls, Nor rests with me to speak or to forbear. My will it was to preach of peace, and lo! I see in heaven a sword;— Son, take God's blessing in a choice of woes: Betwixt an earthly and a heavenly king, Elect of God, this day election make! Her. See, see! The primate clasps his hands, and lifts them— Heavenward he looks! John of Sal. He speaks. Bec. My choice is made. [There is a pause. The assistant bishops then lead Becket to the archiepiscopal throne, the two choirs singing the Te Deum in alternate verses. ACT II. Scene I.—The Castle of Northampton. King Henry, Queen Eleanor, Richard de Luci, Cornwall, Fitz-Urse, the Bishop of Lisieux, Leicester. K. Hen. If e'er I truly loved a man 'twas that man; Nor any loved me better. Many a time, In years gone by, I marked him on me bend An eye that, up and down, took measure full— Sole man was he that looked me full in face— Of my hid soul, yet ended with a smile, As though, beyond the ill, it kenned some good I knew not of myself. The greater crime that knowing me he mocks me! A thousand times that man hath heard me swear That alien none or priest shall share my kingdom. I'll wear it like the armour on my back; I'll wield it as a man wields his own members; I'll walk, its living soul! De Luci. Thomas is honest. K. Hen. He has me there: the crafty and the keen, These I outrun. De Luci. And not, I think, ambitious. K. Hen. He was ambitious till the height was gained: No step remaining for his climbing foot, He kneels him down a saint! Fitz-Urse. A saint is Becket That makes his feast with sinners. What a race! There's one at Exeter that, charged with crime, Dropped poison in the accuser's cup. Corn. And Gilbert Who scorns to hide the failings of his cloth Reports some priest at Winchester well known, Who, leagued with robbers, left his church-door wide:— They stole the chalice. Q. Elea. These be Becket's clients, Secure from civil courts! Who loves the sin Will screen the sinner. K. Hen. Ay, good queen; you hate him! Your tongue is sharp against him many a year; Sharpest, men whisper, since that May long past, When, young in face, and chancellor not bishop, He with the pageant of his greatness filled The broad eye of the world; and certain ladies Whose gamesome graces lit your court made vow One night to put his gravity to proof, And found that they had stained their fame, not his, Their glamour and their glitter still to him But gleam of swarming gnats! That night your spy Found him on bare boards sleeping: Q. Elea. John of Oxford Reports your favourite's gratitude. At feast He descants on your Highness thus—‘This puppet, Who sans my aid at Rome in Stephen's time Had lacked his realm, and twice since then had lost it, This feather dancing on a nation's crown, This bubble winking on the Church's cup, Presumes himself my king!’ How answers Henry? 'Tis thus—‘The violet of humility Not oft 'mid regal virtues finds a place: In the heath garland of Plantagenet Be mine to wear it first!’ John of Oxf. (entering with a profound obeisance). May it please your Highness, A noisy challenge soon will beat your gates: Southward ten miles from this the primate halts; There learned he that the royal grooms had filled That mansion pre-ordained to house his greatness By providence of his friends;—incensed, he rides To Canterbury at morn. K. Hen. Pernicious upstart! Whom, groping in the dirt, this hand upraised And lodged on high to be my shame and plague; Vile hypocrite wearing religion's mask And signing with his cross rebellion's way; To Canterbury let him! He shall wake, His pride's debauch exhaled, in heavier bonds Than Odo wore the Conqueror's prelate brother.— Speak out thy thought, good John! John of Oxf. Please it your Highness, If I might counsel, give the fool his way. Throughout all England, save alone this city, Mailed by your peers and splendid with your court, That man's a king; a pope at Canterbury: Once here, he's in your power. K. Hen. There's much in that. John of Oxf. Yield him his house; a street, if he demands it: A thunder-shower ere long shall drench his plumes: Methinks I see his knights and chaplains flying— Q. Eleanor. Let them not fly to me! No skirt of mine Shall fence the pigmies! John of Oxf. For the Royal Customs, Name not their name at first: that blow comes last: I glance at this to guard you from his wiles. He swears that with a triple fraud his feet Were snared that day when, sore against his will, At Clarendon he bowed before them. First— K. Hen. Be brief, good John! John of Oxf. Tax first, my lord, the primate With unparticipated crimes; his only; His special forfeit, his unshared offence; Then shall his bishops leave him. One thing more: See that he 'scape not! nail him to this isle! If once he stand on Christendom's broad ground With feet unchained, the might of Christendom Will rise into his arm. Who wields that might Hurls the three-bolted thunder from the clouds And rules the orb of earth. De Tracy (entering). My liege, two priests, Sent by my lord the primate. K. Hen. Bid them enter. [Herbert of Bosham and Llewellen enter.Sirs, ere ye speak, the boon ye claim is yours: A humbler company hath filled, I hear, The primate's house. Return, and let him know Their boldness is rebuked. [He turns away. Herbert and Llewellen bow low and depart. And now to business. My lords, there hath been question here and there Of benefices, and the right to fill them; We find the Church o'er-fleshed with lands and tithes; She staggers 'neath their weight. To stay that evil We will that presentations from this hour Be deemed his appanage who holds the fief. Nobles and Courtiers. Our swords shall guard it! Henry and our right! K. Hen. My Lord Justiciary alone is silent. De Luci. My liege, the Royal Customs were our theme: I deem the royal claim doubtful in part; More doubtful yet this claim to presentations: The law must solve that knot. The law declared, Nor swayed by spiritual threat or civil I will enforce that law. K. Hen. My lords, farewell! [All depart, except John of Oxford. Come hither, John! I know it now: alone He rules his realm whose hand, unquestioned, turns That inmost, central wheel which turns all others. Lisieux himself this day was mine but half— Henceforth all bishops must be my creation. John of Oxf. A nomination from the royal lips Meets but a coy resistance. K. Hen. That's sophistic: The power that's indirect is incomplete. Those monks who ratified my choice of Becket, Had you been named, not he, had spurned my choice. We want new laws. The king must make his prelates; The chapters—say their delegates rather—met Not in their minsters but his royal chapel, Must ratify his choice. John of Oxf. That time will come; But they the deed who fear not, fear the shame And will not sin i' the sun. Leave all to me. Break, where you can, the courage of those bishops; Divide them, each from each; keep vacant long The sees. At last your stiffest will consent To that which haply, urged this day, might shake Its gloss from Lisieux's silk. When comes that hour Your Highness shall not miss it. K. Hen. Look to that! [King Henry departs. John of Oxf. (alone). Yes, yes! 'Tis I must look to that, and all things: The rest but talk: what's done is done by me! What marvel? Blind they are, these kings and nobles; While those who see—the cleric race—are mad, And differ but in manner of their madness. First, there's the Church's champion, like this Becket, Who wins from her small thanks; he might have had My aid; he spurned it. Comes the prelate next Who softly struts, a spiritual king, In miniver and gold like Winton's Henry; Then he that, all too proud for pomps extern, Grows thin with feeding on his self-conceit And sours with glances at his neighbour's gain; He who out-fasts the Church's fasts; out-watches Her vigils; never coveted her thrones Till wholesomer men possessed them. Gilbert, Gilbert! A saint wert thou! What hindered thee from running? Let Satan answer that! The king is mine; That flame-eyed queen he hates will drive him on With none to guide him. I am scarce ambitious; But I was born beneath a politic star, Was trained to walk in labyrinthine ways, And needs must use my natural faculties. The game!—'tis that I love! O Gilbert, Gilbert! Save that that faith ascetic once thy boast, Though dead by day, yet, spectre of itself, Still leans by night a nightmare o'er thy bed, How fair a game were thine! Scene II.—Northampton; Becket's House. Becket sitting on a low bed in his pontificals. A large number of bishops enter. 1st Bishop. Most reverend father, primate of all England, We grieve to learn your Grace is ill— Bec. That's past; Brother, time presses: 'tis to-day the feast Of good King Edward's relics late translated; I pray you to be plain. 2nd Bishop. My lord, we bishops Are fed on common food, breathe common air; Rumours we hear which reach not that high clime Wherein your Grace abides. Beware, my lord, For as a cliff eternal sits this king; In vain the billows beat its base. Bec. The Church Was once the rock; nations the waves. Who next? 3rd Bishop. My lord, our duty is to speak the truth: Destruction stands against us, face to face: The king has sworn to vindicate—nay more, To change henceforth to laws, his Royal Customs. Bec. 'Tis so. 4th Bishop. His barons and his knights are with him: He, like the Conqueror, lifts an iron hand; They, like an iron breast-plate on his breast, Have vowed them to the vengeance of his will. Bec. 'Tis so. 5th Bishop. My lord, the last were I to flee This fight: not less the wrestler needs firm ground; The giant set on quicksands, or on ice, Becomes the pigmy's laughter, Peter's rock Was once the strength of each true churchman's battle: What find we now? A Pope, and anti-pope; The Emperor with the last; and with the first England and France. No Pope will war on England; A sager Henry fights old Beauclerk's wars;— Beware lest you should rouse a bloodier Rufus. Bec. My lords, have you said all? Now, hear me speak. I might be large to tell you, courtier prelates, That if the Conqueror's was an iron hand Not less 'twas just. Oftenest it used aright Its power usurped. It decked no idiot brow With casual mitre; neither lodged in grasp That, ague-shaken, scarce could clutch its bribe, The sceptres of the shepherds of Christ's flock. I might remind you that, if Rufus lived A bestial life, he died the death of beasts; That Henry Beauclerk met that day in Anselm A keener head than his and heavier hand Albeit a gentler; that his ten years' war Ended in this—Investitures disowned, Church discipline restored, Christ's poor protected. O happy sage! in battles of this world The cloistral shades of Bec were with him still, Its holy anthems ever in his ears; And when the craven prelates round his throne, Summoned for counsel, counsel dared not give, Silent they hung their heads; they babbled not Plain treason, or veiled threat. Gil. My lord, your pardon! We dare not leave the sacred charge of souls To strive in worldly conflicts. Bec. Gilbert! Gilbert! They that rejoice in heaven o'er sinners saved Wept for thy fall. Is that the hand which wrote, ‘Apostate is the man who turns his back Upon St. Peter's chair’? My voice it was Raised thee from Hereford's see to London's see; I hoped thee brave and wise. Vantage thou hadst, Chastening from youth thy spirit and thy flesh, At Cluny first, and afterwards at Gloucester;— Then Satan made alliance with the world, And wrecked thee through thy fame— Gilbert, some swineherd or some scullion grasps Thy destined crown in heaven! Bishops of England! For many truths by you this day enforced, Hear ye in turn but one. The Church is God's: Lords, were it ours, then might we traffic with it; At will make large its functions, or contract; Serve it or sell; worship or crucify. I say the Church is God's; for He beheld it, His Thought, ere time began; counted its bones, Which in His Book were writ. I say that He From His own side in water and in blood Gave birth to it on Calvary, and caught it, Despite the nails, His Bride, in His own arms: I say that He, a Spirit of clear heat, Lives in its frame, and cleanses with pure pain His sacrificial precinct, but consumes The chaff with other ardours. Lords, I know you; What done ye have, and what intend ere yet Yon sun that rises weeping sets this night; And therefore with this charge bind I your souls: If any secular court shall pass its verdict On me, your lord, or ere that sin be sinned I bid you flee that court; if secular arm Attempt me, lay thereon the Church's ban, Or else against you I appeal to Rome. To-day the heathen rage: I fear them not: If fall I must, this hand, ere yet I fall, Stretched from the bosom of a peaceful gown Above a troubled king and darkening realm, Shall send God's sentence forth. My lords, farewell! [The bishops bow low and depart. Scene III.—A Street in Northampton. John of Oxford, Fitz-Urse. Fitz-Urse. They baited him two days: he's out of breath, Not out of heart. John of Oxf. His mitred brethren first Quaked for themselves. 'Twas brave to watch them later When charge on charge was hurled on him alone And no word uttered which impugned their order; To mark them whispering first; then glancing round, Like woodland creatures peering from their holes When storms are gone. Ere long they basked and swelled Like birds on late-drenched branches, sunshine-gilt, And cleared their throats for song. Fitz-Urse. The king observed them: He said, ‘They nought had grudged it had my voice Vouchsafed them John of Oxford for their primate; Ay, or yourself, Fitz-Urse!’ John of Oxf. That's you, not Henry! The storm they feared rolls back. At noon this day We reach the Royal Customs. Scene IV.—The Great Hall of Northampton Castle. The nobles are ranged along both sides. At the upper end is the royal throne, beyond which are the king's apartments. At the lower end are seated the bishops and abbots. Becket approaches, attended, and wearing the sacred vestments, under the black habit of a canon regular. Entering, he takes the cross from his cross-bearer, and seats himself at the lower end of the hall, Herbert and Fitz-Stephen sitting at his feet. Courtier (to Gilbert of London). Lo, where your primate enters, cross in hand, As though to chase a host of fiends malignant! Gil. The man was born a fool, and fool will die: At dawn this day he said Saint Stephen's mass, ‘Sederunt principes,’ invoking next Saint Edward, king and saint. Henry of Win. (to Roger of York). The primate's face Hath in it light, yet storm. The crisis comes: This day he'll shake the world. [The king enters, and takes his seat on the throne. K. Hen. What means yon cross? Am I a Pagan, that the Holy Sign Must guard a vassal of my throne against me? Bec. It guards the faith of Christ; and well He knows Whose eyes adorable pierce flesh and spirit The cross of Christ was never needfuller yet Than in this hall, and now. [The king leaves his throne suddenly, and returns to his apartments, followed by the bishops, except Winton. Cour. What's this? My lords, I say that in your midst There sits a traitor proven! Baron. A manifest traitor! [Shouts of ‘Treason!’ fill the hall; the tramp of armed men is heard in the court and the passages adjoining the hall, and men in armour are seen at the doors. Fitz-Steph. (in a low voice to Becket). Father, have ready in your hand the Sentence: The storm will break upon you. Royal Marshal. Silence, sir! [Herbert raises his eyes on Becket, and then tùrns them to the crucifix at the end of the hall, on which Becket at once fixes his own. Baron (entering, addressing Becket). My lord, the king demands if you acknowledge That sentence of the court on Friday last Which charged upon your head those moneys lodged While you were chancellor, in the Chancery, And claimed them at your hands? Bec. You have reached your goal, Sir, by well-meted stages. Thursday last Mine enemies, seeking pretence to slay me, Placed at one side the question of the Customs And urged but personal pleas. First, John the Marshal— He, not long since, had sued me for a farm In mine own court; next, to the king's appealing, Plucked from his vest a book of ribald songs, On that, and not the Gospels, making oath. Sirs, was this law or mockery of all law? Not less your parliament, as you know, amerced me; And I submitted. Next they brought in charge The one time rents of Berkhampstead and Eye: I spent them on those castles' just repairs As all men knew;—not less the parliament Fined me three hundred pounds; and I submitted, My Lord of Gloucester for that sum my bail. The king demanded next a thousand marks, A loan long past: he knows I spent that gold And thrice as much, mine own, upon his wars. Then came his last demand—revenues stored In Chancery long since and rents of abbeys, Full thirty thousand marks. That claim set forth, My Lord of Winton raised those aged hands Which poured on me the unction, and appealed; ‘Ho! ye that saw and heard, witness this day! His see was given to him absolved, and free From all pretence of obligations past, By lips of the king's son!’ My lords, that hour My knights fell from me, and my clerics fled; And of my bishops one now near me cried, ‘Would thou wert Thomas only, not archbishop!’ But with me God remained. Baron. My lord, your answer! Bec. Sir, in good time: I make my answer thus. I pay no more false debts. Lords, to my king I stand by nature bound, bound by my homage, Bound by my oath, and bound not less by love: I know his virtues and his princely heart; Remember well his benefits of old: My king I honour—honouring more my God. My lords, they lie who brand mine honest fame With fealty halved; with doubly-linked allegiance He serves his king who serves him for God's sake; But who serves thus must serve his God o'er all. I served him thus, and serve. Corn. You serve the king Who stirred these wars? Who spurned the Royal Customs? Bec. The Customs, ay, the Customs! We have reached At last—'twas time—the inmost of this plot Till now so deftly veiled and ambushed; ‘Customs!’ O specious word, how plausibly abused! In Catholic ears that word is venerable, To Catholic souls custom is law itself, Law that its own foot hears not, dumbly treading A holy path smoothed by traditions old. I war not, sirs, on ways traditionary; The Church of Christ herself is a tradition; Ay, but 'tis God's tradition, not of men! Sir, these your Customs are God's Laws reversed, Traditions making void the Word of God, Old innovations from the first withstood, The rights of Holy Church, the poor man's portion, Sold, and for nought, to aliens. Customs! Customs! Custom was that which to the lord o' the soil Yielded the virgin one day wedded! Customs! A century they have lived; but he ne'er lived The man that knew their number or their scope, Where found, by whom begotten, or how named: Like malefactors, long they hid in holes; They walked in mystery like the noontide pest; In the air they danced; they hung on breath of princes, Largest when princes' lives were most unclean, And visible most when rankest was the mist. Sirs, I defy your Customs; they are nought;— I turn from them to our old English laws, The Confessor's, and those who went before him, The charters old, and sacred oaths of kings: I clasp the Tables twain of Sinai; On them I lay my palms, my breast, my forehead, And on the altars dyed by martyrs' blood, Making to God appeal. Leic. (to Cornwall). My lord, return we; This matter takes a range beyond our powers: Behoves us bear the king his Grace's answer. [They depart. Bec. Why sits he not among us? Lo, his throne! This cross should be its stay. I know the king: Saints of his stock this hour in heaven befriend him! But with man's spirit at times a tempter strives That never loved Christ's cross! Baron. Stigand, proud priest, Was such as you; like his will be your doom! [The bishops return from the king's apartments with signs of terror. Roger of York. Hence! lest we see the proud man's doom. Attendance! Gil. (to Becket). My lord, your pardon! You have placed your bishops This day between the hammer and the anvil; At Clarendon your Grace received the Customs; This day you spurn them. Bec. You have heard, my lords, That partial truth which most envenoms falsehood. May shame deserved by my sin's expiation! At Clarendon I sinned—thus much all know; Few know the limit of that sin, and fewer The threefold fraud that meshed me in that sin From which, like weeping Peter, I arose, To fall, I trust, no more. My lords, that day There came to me two Templars from the king, Who sware his Highness inwardly was racked That, snared by flatterers, he had made demands Which, for his honour's sake, he could not cancel, Yet which, if yielded but in phrase by us, Should vex the Church no further. I refused. Came next the papal envoy from Aumone, With word the Pope, moved by the troublous time, Willed my submission to the royal will. This was the second fraud; remains the third. My lords, the Customs named till then were few; In evil hour I yielded—pledged the Church, Alas! to what I knew not. On the instant The king commanded, ‘Write ye down these Laws:’ And soon, too soon, a parchment pre-ordained Upon our table lay, a scroll inscribed With usages sixteen, whereof most part Were shamefuller than the worst discussed till then. My lords, too late I read that scroll: I spurned it; I sware by Him who made the heavens and earth That never seal of mine should touch that bond, Not mine, but juggle-changed. My lords, that eve A truthful servant and a fearless one Who bears my cross—and taught me too to bear one— Llewellen is his name, remembered be it! Probed me and proved with sharp and searching words, And as the sun my sin before me stood. My lords, for forty days I kept my fast, And held me from the offering of the mass, And sat in sackcloth; till the pope sent word, ‘Arise; be strong, and walk.’ And I arose, And hither came; and here confession make That till the cleansèd leper once again Takes, voluntary, back his leprosy, I with those Royal Customs stain no more My soul which Christ hath washed. [The barons return from the king, and advance to Becket, who retains his seat; at their head Cornwall and Leicester. Corn. My lord, the king commands that on the instant You render up accounts of moneys lodged Whilst you were chancellor, in the Chancery; If not, attend your sentence! Bec. Son and earl, Hear first your father, and the king's. How well I loved that king, how faithfully I served him, Is known to you and all. You said, I think, The king had sent you hither with a sentence;— Son, by a sentence from the King of Kings, By virtue of mine office, and that power It gives me through the laws of Christendom, I bar you from the uttering of that sentence, And seal your lips with silence. Corn. Speak it thou, My Lord of Leicester. Leic. Nay, my lord, not I. I dare not touch a priest. The hand, moreover, Which clasps yon cross, in battle saved my life. Corn. (about to return to the king). Your Grace will here abide— Bec. Am I a bondsman? Corn. Saint Lazarus! no, my lord. Bec. My son, attend! By how much man's imperishable soul Exceeds in worth his body, by so much Beseems you to obey the King of Heaven Above all earthly lords. Nor law, nor reason, Nor human precedent, nor faith divine, Endures that children should condemn their sire. Wherefore this judgment of a king that errs I from me cast, and, under God, appeal To Peter's chair and him who sits thereon, Placing beneath his shield my life, mine honour, And Canterbury's church. My fellow-bishops, This day the vassals not of God but man, You too I summon to that high award; And thus, protected by the Holy See, I hence depart. [Becket rises, and, still bearing his cross, moves toward the gates. De Broc (from the gates). He flies! cut down the traitor! Bec. (looking back). Caitiff and coward! How well thou know'st this hand Is knightly now no more! [He departs; the barons and courtiers standing still, and none daring to arrest him. Scene V.—Castle of Northampton. The King, John of Oxford. K. Hen. The lion's loose! I see it in your eye! John of Oxf. Sire, he is 'scaped. Last evening was his triumph: The people, as he issued hence, knelt down, Craving his blessing. In St. Andrew's convent He chaunted nones, and vespers first; then dined, Ranging the poor, the halt, the lame, the dumb, Around his board in place of friends who fled. When night descended, he took sanctuary In the great church:—they strewed his rushy couch Behind the altar, and with stinted rite Sang compline low in reverence of his sleep After his fight with beasts at Ephesus. Reach he but France, from every turf he treads A knight full-armed shall leap, and rage against you. K. Hen. Guard all the ports! each castle, fort, and village: Who favours his escape shall die the death! ACT III. Scene I.—Castle of Compiègne. Louis, King of France, John of Salisbury, Llewellen. K. Louis. No need of pleading, sirs: I know the man: I met him first breasting the tides of war, And more admired, than joyed to see his banner That still made way when others tacked and veered On that large-labouring sea. In peace I found him A loyal man, and honest, lofty-souled, And resolute in his purpose. Never father So loved, methought, a son, as he his king, Who brave, but erring, plays this day a part Not knightly, and not Christian. Sirs, he's hot, And notes, methinks, but half of that great word, ‘Be wroth, yet sin not.’ Send me here your primate! France loves the noble foe. John of Sal. May it please your Highness, The primate stands resolved to light no flame Betwixt two kings now happily at one: He lacks not therefore grateful heart to France, That great old land which shall not cease from greatness While faithful to its God. He hastes to Sens. K. Louis. I love the man or distant or close by, Knowing him injured, and esteeming just. Tell him no girl-lip in my France hath ever Trembled more sweetly ere it owned the truth, Than this old heart for joy when came the news He trod our shores secure. Scene II.—The Palace at Sens. Pope Alexander III. in consistory with the cardinals. Becket, Herbert of Bosham, and other English priests. The Abbot of Pontigny. Bec. Most holy father, vicar of our Lord, And ye the princely senate of the Church, I have too long your patience taxed: I deemed That, kings impugning, I was bound in honour To impugn my proper sin at Clarendon, And justice do to him who did me wrong. His ‘Royal Customs,’ new compared with her Whose years are from of old, have precedents Which show but late their teeth. Abuse was borne When tyrants played the kitten, not the tiger. To make exception law, concede of right Whate'er old time, enforced or heedless, suffered, This were to wrest the past by fraudulent gloss As heretics wrest Scripture. The Pope. Justly reasoned— The Church might trust the king that served the Church Like Charlemagne: Antiochus, or Herod Shall have his right;—not more! Bec. I grant this also: O'er-ripe corruption breeds foretold disease: Church wealth abounds; it brought the hireling first; It brings the spoiler now. Card. Will. My lord archbishop, Though young in the episcopate, is wise;— ‘Where lies the carcase, there the eagles flock:’ Noting that truth, his Grace would share Church lands With nobles and with kings. Bec. My lord, not so! In troubled days like these, if bandit barons Fierce from the cup, rode forth o'er waste and wild All unconfronted by the Church's barons Like them large-landed, and with knights in train, The landless priest should keep not his own skin. We must not yield to wrong. Card. Will. I understand not: My lord the archbishop late at Clarendon Connived, he said— The Pope. Brother, forbear that theme! The primate made the Christian expiation In sackcloth and in ashes forty days. Her. My lord went later to a second council: Of that he hath not spoken;—bid him speak. The Pope. What council? Bec. At Northampton it was held: There, fooled no longer, I denounced those Customs Whereof last eve I laid the list new-writ For judgment at your footstool. The Pope. I have read them. Six might be borne, though bad: the rest are impious; Servile to kings, seditious 'gainst the Church: Well skilled they all lead up to one—the worst— They bar appeal to this most Holy See, My glory which I yield not to another, The safety of the meanest of Christ's flock. That great appeal removed, by secular hands The arteries of the Church were knotted up, Yea, and to fragments torn that sacred body Whose life is in the whole. For this cause, God Diffused among realms one single Church, That unity might be its life's true pledge, A thing too vast to be engorged by any. That Church enslaved, what next? The Faith must vanish! For on the Church's witness rests the truth, And if that Church be stifled in the embrace Of any fleshly realm—engulfed—absorbed— Who shall receive her words? Card. Will. Yea verily, From the whale's belly when the prophet speaks Who hears is quick of ear. The Pope. The realm thus sinning Ere long shall be partaker with the worm; The blind-worm is its sister, and corruption Its mother, and the dust its winding-sheet; For power, earth-born, shall back once more to earth. O witless kingdoms! scorn ye then that kingdom, Forth from whose womb ye issued—still your stay, The sole not born from mortal lust or pride; The kingdom of one God in Persons Three; The kingdom of the creed and of the prayer; The kingdom of commandments just and wise; The kingdom of the three great Virtues winged Which gaze on heaven; the eight Beatitudes Which walk the earth disguised, sowing God's joy; The Sacraments, those seven great gates of God Betwixt the worlds of spirit and flesh;—the kingdom Wherein God's angels wait upon His poor, And all men share one good! Enough of this My son, what saith your England to these Customs? Bec. I deem the people sound: gravely they love Their ancient laws and immemorial freedom. The nobles, save the noblest, back the king: Their faith is flawless; but too lax their manners To love a righteous law. The Pope. How stand your clergy? Bec. The poor are true, the rich are panic-stricken: We have corruptions: I had hoped ere long To have pruned the worst away:—they grow and flourish: My sin has found me out! The Pope. Your sin? What sin? Bec. The king, who willed that I should be archbishop, Was urgent with the Canterbury monks: They raised no plaint; yet some denied their freedom: More late I too had doubts. To break my staff In danger's hour had been a coward's part: The danger's past; this hour I lodge that staff In the strong hand of Peter's successor; Be his to make decision. [The cardinals converse among themselves. Card. Will. Holy Father, Methinks the island prelate judges well, Yea, and with prudence of the lands most seasoned: He speaks more sagely than King Henry's envoy Whose Latin raised, last eve, a passing smile. King Henry's wrath once lulled— The Pope. It shall not be! The Church gives honour—this the world should know— To those who honour her. This English primate Who chides himself for lacking angel's heart, Witnessed a man's heart in the Church's war; She shall not fail him. Fit he is for rule: His valour proved it, and his meekness proved it, Bearing from one that served him just rebuke As Peter bare from Paul, and, since his time, Popes many in this chair from humblest teachers. Brother, resume your charge, and reign once more Where reigned of old Augustine. For this fight, Which shall not prove a flying season's sport, All qualities are yours, save one—discretion. Your life was long a life of courts, and camps, And splendours of this world: at Pontigny, A holier seat, find rest. Its reverend abbot Will give you welcome. Abbot of Pon. Happy house is ours, Welcoming a confessor! Bec. The fast monastic, The ascetic garb, and labour in the fields Teach me humility! The Pope. You shall not miss it; Your sacred habit be it mine to send: It shall be honest serge. Scene III.—The Palace at Rouen. Fitz-Urse, William de Tracy, Richard Brito, Hugh de Moreville, courtiers and ladies. Fitz-Urse. As good as dead! De Tracy. The three-days'-strangled dog But fouls the air: his bark is heard no more. Brito. At Sens the Sacred College frowned upon him; The Pope disfrocked him; forth he fled by night To mate him with the antipope: to-day He lies in dungeon bound. Lady. Some swear he's mad; I think he's wedded. De More. No; though secularised;— He keeps a Flemish farm. Fitz-Urse (to De Broc, entering). What news from home? Some three weeks since you won the king's permission To drive that traitor's kin from England's shores. De Broc. I bide my time. When winter snows fall fast That vermin brood shall face it. [Departs. Courtier. Month by month His hate grows stronger. Fitz-Urse. Ay, there's cause for that. Cour. The ravished Church lands and the heiress 'scaped? Fitz-Urse. And cause beside. On some pretence of law De Broc drave forth Idonea from the house Of Becket's sister, Becket three months primate: The maid took sanctuary in Canterbury. Instant they sued her as a royal ward; Judgment against her went. The day had come, And round the minster knights and nobles watched: The chimes rang out at noon: then from the gate Becket walked forth, the maiden by his side;— Ay, but her garb conventual showed the nun! They frowned, but dared no more. The king was wroth, And yet in part amused. De Broc rushed in With face storm-black. Henry burst forth in laughter; The infection spread—we laughed till heaven's broad vault Laughed back to hear us. Well, De Broc's my friend:— There's reason good that hate in him should prosper. Scene IV.—A room in the Abbey of Pontigny. Becket, Herbert of Bosham, Llewellen, abbot and monks. Bec. Praise be to God, and praise to her, His daughter, This abbey chaste and kind of Pontigny, That washed the wanderer's weary feet, and found A country for the exile! Reverend abbot, I longed for this immersed in secular cares, I longed for this throned on Augustine's seat, A still retreat for penitence and prayer, A quiet cell for books and meditation: These things are mine. Abbot. My lord, your holy joy To us is both a kindling and a warning: Our life is hard; you teach us hardest life Should be the sweetest. Heavenly is our hope; Your joy reminds us heaven is round us ever, Had we but faith to feel it. O my lord! God grant that custom harden not in you That sense to-day so tender; for, the edge Of spiritual sensibilities made blunt, Our spiritual world becomes a leaf frost-curled; Not all the songs of angel hosts can charm us; We starve 'mid manna showers. Bec. I have put aside The canon law, and study lore dogmatic: It better feeds the soul. I see once more Paris, that holy city! Abbot. Once 'twas holy. Bec. My mother, when I went to Paris first, A slender scholar bound on quest of learning, Girdling my gown collegiate, wept full sore; Then laid on me this hest;—both early and late To love Christ's Mother and the poor of Christ, That so her prayer in heaven and theirs on earth Beside me moving as I walked its streets, Might shield me from its sins. Abbot. Men say your mother Loved the poor well, and still on festivals, Laying her growing babe in counter-scale, Heaped up an equal weight of clothes and food, Which unto them she gave. Bec. She trained my sister To live an angel on the earth. Lo, there! The red morn widens through the falling snows, And the storm rocks your towers! What then? The spring Once more will come and wake that earliest flower Whose white is purer for its rim of green; The thrush will sing again. Her. Your sycamore, Large-leaved, once more will roof you as you read Those psalms that shook the Solomonian Temple, The Apostolic letters which made glad The young and foe-girt churches of the Lord, And, dearer yet, the Gospels whose warm lips Still kiss the Saviour's footsteps as He moves O'er earth. Bec. And learn at last to be a Christian! Monk (entering). The Holy Father Has sent that promised habit to his Grace, Likewise these letters. Llew. By Saint David, good! The hood is filled with snow! The Pope knows well Some heads are hot! Bec. I kiss this habit's edge;— Herbert, what say the letters? Her. (reading). ‘At one blow King Henry confiscates the primate's goods, Farms, manors, castles, rents.’ Bec. Now God be praised! Her. (reading). ‘His name is blotted from the service-books; Lastly, his friends are banished, kith and kin, The old, the young, the cleric and the lay, Widows and babes in arms, four hundred all; His sister, sickness-worn; the nun Idonea;— This day they plough the bleak, snow-blinded sea, Oath-bound to bear their wail beneath the gates Of him their exile's cause, so named.’ Monk. Hark! hark! Another Monk (rushing in). A famished English host is wailing round us! They beat the gates; they swarm into the courts; They bear with them a woman three hours dead, Demand my lord the primate. Scene V.—Palace of the Empress Matilda at Rouen. The Empress, John of Oxford. John of Oxf. Chiefly for pride his enemies arraign him: Great madam, pride not always is a vice: His pride is pride a son may well be proud of: He says, ‘The daughter of earth's wisest king Was greatest when she put her greatness off; Is greater now, ruling through this strong arm, Than if, as once, she from her standard shook Dominion on the winds.’ Empress. King Henry's daughter Should know some policy. I have lived, and reigned, Done much, borne much, and in these later years Much striven to win that docile heart which makes Affliction's fruit, experience, profitable. My end, they say, draws near. My son well knows it, And yet he comes not nigh. John of Oxf. His Highness grieves He walked not by your counsel touching Becket, Who, changed from better promise, plots and schemes Made blind by lust of power, and greed beside Of gold which perisheth. Empress. It may be so: Much that I know of Thomas I mislike; But what I know I know through men that hate him. Such knowledge I distrust. Chamberlain (entering). May it please your Highness, A priest from Pontigny. [John of Salisbury enters, accompanied by a veiled nun. Empress. You are come, I think, Sir, from that abbey where the primate late Of England, lives recluse? John of Sal. Illustrious lady, The primate hath not ceased to be the primate. In Oxford, madam, that religious seat When learning, tested, mounts the grades of merit, Men say it graduates. Virtue, like learning, Boasts its degrees of merit, tried and proved: Its university is wide as earth: My lord the primate hath proceeded exile;— The next degree, who knows? Empress. I honour, sir, Your frank, yet grave accost: I honour, too, What under that I note, a loving zeal For him you call your friend. Scant friends to me Your primates and your prelates proved in England: My father king, they made their oath to me: My father dead, they crowned revolted Stephen: And though the usurper's brother, Henry of Winton, More late my champion proved—that arm of might Which waved my banner o'er the English realm— He wrung from me concessions first; and, last, Condoned his brother's crime and re-enthroned him. John of Sal. Madam, that time erroneous, and unblest— Empress. Back to our theme. I never loved your primate: I deemed him for my son a dangerous friend, Albeit an honest one. His elevation I strenuously withstood. I saw in Thomas One that, installed in Canterbury's chair, Might shake a younger throne. I would your primate Had let the Royal Customs be, and warred Against the ill customs of the Church. 'Tis shame To ordain a clerk in name that lacks a cure, Whom idleness must needs ensnare in crime; Scandal—and worse—to screen an erring clerk, More fearing clamour than the cancer slow Of inly-wasting sin. Scandal it is When seven rich benefices load one priest, Likeliest his soul's damnation. John of Sal. Scandals indeed! And no true friend to Thomas is the man Who palliates such abuses. For this cause, Reluctantly he grasped Augustine's staff Therewith to smite them down. Madam, the men Who brand them most are those who breed the scandals: The primate warred on such. The king, to shield them, Invoked the Royal Customs. Empress. Some are old. John of Sal. Old by the Norman reckoning, not the Saxon. Empress. Sir, sir, I know that cry: my throne it cost me! Penitent London, with the prodigal's zeal Had spread to me its arms; rebellion's head Lay bruised beneath my feet; one common joy Beamed from the fronts of cleric, noble, serf: Sir, 'mid this new-born zeal a shout arose— ‘The laws of good King Edward, not the Norman!’ I spurned that cry, and scarce escaped with life;— Return we to those Customs. Some are old. John of Sal. Madam, at heart all sin is old as Cain. What profit, lady, on the Judgment Day, If kings that erred can say, ‘By lineal right That sin to me hereditary came, And I entailed it on my latest heir!’ Save—save your son! Empress. The king advised not with me. How many are those Customs you condemn? John of Sal. Madam, sixteen are registered. Lo! one: ‘We suffer not appeal to Peter's chair.’ Madam, Christ said to Peter, ‘Strengthen thou Thy brethren:’ later, ‘Feed My sheep and lambs.’ Shall England's Church, Augustine's child and Rome's, Be sundered from his aid? Empress. Now, God forbid! John of Sal. The next: ‘No bishop shall depart the realm Without the king's consent.’ Such laws in force, Church councils are no more. Empress. That Custom's novel! John of Sal. The next: ‘No baron holding from the Crown, Whate'er his crime, shall feel the Church's censure Without the king's approval.’ Madam, Christ Gave to the Church His keys, and bade her use them, That virgin thus her precinct might remain, Her feast unstained. The great exempt, the mean, Must share their license. Empress. Sir, that Custom's old, Yet should be rarely used, nor shield the sinner: The Church is mistress of her sacraments; Else were God's temple to a tavern changed, Or den of thieves. John of Sal. The next: ‘When bishoprics Are vacant, till the king hath willed the election, Their rents remain with him.’ John of Oxf. (rising). May it please your Highness, Humbly I take my leave. Empress. Sir, fare you well! [John of Oxford departs. These Customs are in part of recent date; In part are ancient, and throughout are strained: My son has erred, enrolling them as laws; Not thus my father wrought—has erred besides Requiring from the bishops pledge to keep them: We kept, till now, rule and exception both; They housed together in uneasy friendship: Your primate errs, I think, in nobler sort: Let him endure the earlier of those Customs, So they remain unwrit. John of Sal. Madam, your words Are truth and peace. Empress. I ever loved truth well; Alas, not peace! Yet gladly, ere I die Would I have portion with the peace-makers. John of Sal. Madam, speak then those words of peace once more, But to your son. Empress. He listens not to me. John of Sal. There is one listening region in his heart: It hears a whisper low. He loves his children: There touch him! There I touched him—not in vain. The Primate had renounced the chancellor's place; The king's wrath burned: two days I strove to slake it, The Great Seal lying on the ground before him: None dared to lift it. Thus I spake at last: ‘Pride is the sin of kings: that pride infects Their babes; drags down on them their parents’ penance. Your grand-sire had a son—but one—Prince William: He from his sire had caught the haughty heart, And oft in childhood sware, “When I am king These English boors, harnessed like ox or ass, Shall cleave the ‘Norman's glebe!’” He ne'er was king! God's sea-waves o'er him closed.’ While thus I spake The prince ran by; his father's eye pursued him— That hour his heart was changed. Empress. My son has left me. Sir, there are sorrows greater than my sire's Then when he wept his son: Henry's will live, And to his father be as mine to me. I must not more detain you, sir. Commend me Unto my lord the primate. John of Sal. Royal lady, This youthful nun—Idonea is her name, And something of her history may have reached you— Is missioned with a message to your ear: The maid is true: may God protect your Highness! [John of Salisbury bows low, and departs. Empress. I pray you lift your veil: that hand, I think, Derives from ancient lineage, and like light Shows on your sable garb. [Idonea lifts her veil. There's rest in gazing Upon a countenance nor by passions marred, Nor fretted by perplexities of thought. You are older than you seem. You have known great grief, Yet mourned nor husband dead nor lover false: I deem you orphan. Ido. I have lost my parents. Empress. And recently, I think? Ido. My second mother Expired but few weeks since. She was of those Exiled of late—the primate's widowed sister;— In the great storm she died. Empress. That churl De Broc Outstepped his warrant. Ido. 'Mid celestial choirs One note is added to her song on earth— The sweetest! I have heard it in my dreams, And walked the long day after as on air. Not now she sings alone the peace of heaven, The bliss of saints; she sings their joy not less Who share on earth the Saviour's crown of thorns. What other joy like that of sacrifice? Without it love were nought! In death she lay A lovely shape that seemed to smile in sleep, And placid as the snowy fields around. Her brother raised this crucifix from her breast And bade me bear it to you. ‘Let her wear it In death,’ he said, ‘and it will bring her peace; And, wearing it, let her win back her son, Who walks in ways of death.’ Empress. Flatterers, not friends, Are now my son's advisers. I could wish That late-born hatred 'twixt him and the primate Changed to old love. Ido. O lady, deem it not! The primate hate your son! How many a time Have I not heard him praise the king's high heart; His wit at years when others chase their follies; His prescient thought; his knowledge won from all, Drawn in with every breath; his wind-like swiftness, Now here, now there; persistence iron-nerved, Pliant at need, but with resilience still Back-springing to a purpose of that height Which makes ambition virtue. Shake from him But two fierce passions which convulse his spirit— Anger was one, he did not name the other— No prince there reigns like him. Empress. The heart of Thomas Was ever large; that know I well. Ido. Full oft I have heard him cast the royal horposcope: ‘Let him be England's king, a child of England! If all the world beside were his for realm The solid centre's there; his home be England! Let him sun out its virtues with his love; Strike off its bonds; unite its rival races; Restore old usages; replant the poor In those huge forests now the hunter's spoil; Be loved at English hearths, from those fair cliffs England's white girdle, to her mountain thrones; His name be honoured in her fields and farms, And minsters gathering, as the parent bird Gathers its young, the growing cities round them, Honoured by all her brave, industrious sons, So Christian-like in manners and in mind, So grave in deeds, and yet so merry-hearted, And in their plainness kind.’ Empress. My son's ambition Hath wider scope than England. Pass that by: Who hopes so much for him must love him truly. I hope; but fear. In Thomas he had found At least an honest friend, and fearless friend, A counsellor by private aims untainted. Ido. A mother's counsel— Empress. He revered it once: That queen of his hath slain his reverence; That woman with five realms and fifty devils, Who witched him to her love. She loved him never; And with her strident voice and angry eyes Scared from her soon his heart. A faithfuller husband Had been obsequious less. A wife! a wife! You on whose brow virginity is throned Are liker to a wife than Eleanor! In that obdurate will, and lawless humour, And shallow heart, despite all marriage bonds Wifehood's true spirit had been impossible Even had she loved him well! A married mistress Let such be called. Prop me this pillow, child, And put from you that wildered, frightened look. My father—him I loved the most on earth;— If wars I moved, if these thin fingers clutched The sceptre all too tight, 'twas for this cause, Because his hand had held it! Ido. Gracious lady— Empress. Come near, and lay your lily cheek near mine, But touch not mine, or yours will catch its fever. Fix now your eyes on yonder winding Seine, Seen 'twixt the crowded city towers. Mark there How yon unladen barks run down the river:— So lightly issues forth our youth's emprise Full-sailed to shores unknown. Mark next how slowly Those barges cargo-burthened mount the stream With painful toil, and oars that keep not time:— Thus—youth gone by—fortunes fulfilled oppress us; The tide against us works. O what a beaming shape was he in boyhood! The sun declines, methinks. Where lodge you, child? Ido. I know not, madam. Empress. Rest in yonder convent: I built it, and they love me. Ere you sleep Give me a prayer. Our faith remains; our prayer Grows cold with age—at least the prayer of princes. Maid, I have heard your name; seen you ere now, But know not where. The Pope hath sent me missives, Praying mine intercession with my son;— He hath it; but in limits. Child, farewell! [Idonea kneels, kisses the Empress' hand, and withdraws. Scene VI.—The Abbey of Pontigny. Becket, John of Salisbury, Herbert of Bosham. Bec. Still, by my soul, I think he may be honest:— The fraudulent are the weak; the king, we know, Is strong alike in body and in mind. John of Sal. But not, alas! in spirit. ‘Strength to bring forth.’ The lack of faith is oftenest lack of strength, Of spiritual strength; lack, too, of spiritual courage: Worldlings are all too craven to believe. This king lacks faith, and knows not that he lacks it; At times he's superstitious; never godly: Seeing he sees not, and in blindness thus Tramples his good. His youth had soaring aims— Bec. Still unfulfilled. We must have patience with him! God gives to man his threescore years and ten, Then patient stands to see if in those years His snail-paced creature makes one hour's advance. I counted patience once man's humblest virtue; I grow to deem of it as marvellous most Of all God's attributes. Return to Henry! His forefathers, like him, when wroth, were mad: His empire's vaster far than theirs; his pride Proportionately entempested. I think it— I hope it, honest error. Her. The spirit of Bernard Hangs on this pure and hallowed air. Your brow Was furrowed once; to-day it wears no frown: His Holiness did well to send you hither. Bec. Leisure and peace, and communings with God Above the glebe new-turned, when fresh and sweet Rises earth's breath, and in the thicket near The unimpatient bird-song, evening-lulled, Is soberer than at dawn, must help, I think, Attuned by daily offices divine, And faces calm wherein the chaunt lives on When psalms are o'er—must help to soften hearts How hard soe'er, and softening them, to brighten. Here learn we that, except through sin of man, There's evil none on earth—not pain, not scorn, Not death! Were Christ her law this earth were heaven. Lo there! How well they name this stream ‘Serene!’ Serene it wanders from the chestnut forests, Serene it whispers through yon orchard bowers, Serene it slides along the convent walls: It counts the hours;—mark, as the sun descends, How those gold lime-stems burn within its mirror In colonnade that scorns imperial halls! This spot is surely holier than men know; I think some saint died here! John of Sal. Yet here, even here, The battle of all ages lies before us! Bec. Well know I that, my friend. This eve I mused On war, with heart at peace. Her. Beneath yon beech You read a book— Bec. Saint Anselm's. Holy souls This book hath holier made; for me, a sinner, It serves a humbler part. My lot is war: But close beside me scoffs a voice malign, ‘Thy youth vain-glorious sought the tented field From haughty stomach or from angry spleen; So now; for nought thou rend'st the world asunder.’ In doubt I stand: then comes to me this book, And saith, ‘Thy cause is Anselm's: who was he? This was no brawler, and no voice of war: This was a soul that in the cloistral shade Had reached the sixth fair decade of his life, O'erstepped the threshold of the eternal Sabbath; This was a virgin spirit, one to whom Man's praise seemed blot and blame; an infant spirit Whose meekness nothing earthly could perturb; An angel spirit that, with feet on earth, Saw still God's face in heaven— Certes he sought no battles; yet he found them; Long agonies of conflict in old age, An exiled man, or fronting hostile kings.’ The tempter leaves me; and my strength returns;— But lo, Guarine, our abbot! John of Sal. Slow his step:— Bec. I had forgotten; but I know it all: The king has sworn, unless they drive me hence, To war on each Cistercian house in England. Solve we this good man's doubt. The Abbot (joining them). Alas, my lord— Bec. My kind and generous friend, we part tomorrow! God wills it thus, not any earthly king: We have had our rest. It nerves us for that toil Which summons us once more. The Abbot. Pavia's bishop And Citeaux's abbot fear— Bec. Draw near me, friend: The morn your predecessor left this abbey, Lifted, reluctant, to the pastoral charge, I at Saint Stephen's altar said my mass; And, offering my thanksgiving there— But no! When next at Lyons, ask my lord archbishop; He stood behind a pillar, and heard all. Brother, farewell. God guard this temple well! His Spirit be its light till Christ shall come To judge the world: and if through Satan's fraud, The wrath of kings, the madness of the people, It suffer wrong, may He with His own hand Once more uplift it to a tenfold glory Which shall not fail or fade. Once more, farewell. [All depart, except Herbert. Her. (alone). Ten talents lodged in that large honest hand The night before his consecration morn; And then that Bleeding Hand closed down above them; And, last, the inquest of those Eyes divine Cleansing his soul! Our Thomas has not hid Those talents ten in napkin, or in earth: Therefore the red rose of that palm nail-pierced Grows larger daily on his own. That's well! Peter and Paul shall press that hand in heaven. How oft he says, ‘My youth had much to expiate.’ How few or make or will the expiation! It comes to him in measure without stint: His place in heaven shall be among the crowned, Not them that break her glebe. Scene VII.—A bay window in the Palace at Le Mans. King Henry, John of Oxford. K. Hen. I am ill at ease, good John. Some fate malignant Drags still my fortunes from their starry way And drowns them in the mist. His kinsfolk's exile Blackened my name with Christendom's abhorrence; The traitor's self, cast forth from Pontigny, Stands stronger than before. Of all my foes this man alone, this Becket, Hath marred and dwarfed me in my own esteem; And for that cause I hate him—and will hate. It may be I was rash. My mother thinks so, A politic head that never loved the priests: She warns me to revolt not 'gainst the Church Lest God should rouse my sons, in turn revolted, One day to plague their sire. John of Oxf. May it please you, sir, Sickness, a superstitious thing, and death, Whose coming shadow casts a ghostly semblance On commonest shapes, perturb her mind, else strong. Likewise she listens to that nun Idonea. K. Hen. My barons in this battle with the Church Serve me with soul divided. Becket's eye Went through them at Northampton. Becket's legate:— Ere long the man will hurl a Censure forth: My bishops weep and wail to me to spare them Nor dash them broken 'gainst the canon law: The Emperor wanes; his antipope wastes daily: The Pope is waxing, and he knows his power. I have lit my camp-fires on a frozen flood;— Methinks, the ice wears thin. John of Oxf. Retreat is none. K. Hen. I have resolved to send an embassy To Rome. What say you? John of Oxf. Who shall be its head? His Grace of York, or Gilbert? K. Hen. Gilbert! Gilbert! Gilbert's a knave that slips between two stools: His youth had soarings: if for each tenth step He took in sanctity, or seemed to take, He could have ta'en but one in honest dealing, The man had reached a sort of crazy saintship: For greatness of this world courage he lacks. Nor York, nor Gilbert! Guess again. John of Oxf. I cannot. K. Hen. You are my choice. Make strong this embassy: Save weakness every fault is pardonable: Within this paper are your orders writ: Concession—ay, but making definite still Those lines which keep our citadel intact, The essence and the pith of all I strove for. Be this your chart. John of Oxf. Sire, if it please your Highness, This battle, though a hard one, shall be gained, Two things conditioned—freedom and a purse. Cramp not my movements: definite rules and limits I never loved. This day the skilfullest hand In tracing such should weave but nets to snare Your royal purpose, or a rope to choke it. The serpent's finer wisdom helps us oft No more than plain simplicity of doves; The fox's vulgarer craft serves then our need. Leave terms to me; but grant me wide credentials: The Pope will claim both pledge and oath; I give them; Their import others can decide more late Wiselier than I; your Grace hath wits scholastic: With such the royal conscience shall consult, The Censures first recalled. K. Hen. I see it, John. Your counsel's deep. [A horn is heard. John of Oxf. The prince returned from chase! [Prince Henry rides up with attendants bearing a dead stag, and stops under the window. P. Hen. Father, against your will or with your will, This stag, my first, finds way to my old master. [Gallops on. K. Hen. He's gone! 'Tis for that boy my soul I peril! Scene VIII.—Vezelay. Becket, John of Salisbury, Herbert of Bosham, Abbot of Pontigny. Bec. My patience less hath served him than disserved: He stands upon the imminent verge of schism, Transacts, conspires, with that revolted prelate Who, with the Emperor and his antipope, Stands third in Satan's court. Lo, here his letter This hour arrived in cypher from Cologne! [He reads. John of Sal. (reading it). ‘Pope Alexander, and his cardinals false, Who prop that traitor Thomas, from this hour Shall boast mine aid no more.’ What say ye, sirs? Her. A legate's powers are yours. Bec. I heeded seldom My personal wrongs; but thus to trade with sin, In huckstering sort to barter Christian honour, Or simulate the crime he dares not act— I say 'tis foul, 'tis foul! Her. At Clarendon A second council meets. The bishops there Must swear—so wills their lord—to eschew henceforth All laws not royal, all appeals to Rome: Our English Church shall stand with bleeding flank From Christendom down-cloven. Bec. (rising). One time in me Passions of earth commixed with zeal divine: That time should now be past. At Pontigny Two years I kept my vigil and my fast; In reverence delved the dark breast of the earth From which we came, to which we shall return: My vanities, I trust, are dead. Abbot. They are. Bec. Then action's time is come. At Soissons late I watched three nights before three saintly shrines, Praying for strength. It comes to me this hour. England no more shall lie a corse: a spirit Shall lift once more that head blasphemers spurn; To that dried arm the flesh shall come as flesh Pure in the child. No more the wail shall rise From vacant minsters, abbeys sold like farms, Deserted village churches, Christian babes Amerced of Christian food. Bring forth the parchments! From him the crowned transgressor to the least The Censure falls on all. Arch. of Sens (entering). Your Grace has heard it?— The English king lies sick. Bec. Lies sick—alas! I war not on the sick. John of Sal. The king excepted, The Censure's naught. The heart of England burns, And waits that stroke which, troubling not allegiance In civil things, keeps pure the things of God: A frost will fall upon that fiery heart, The chiefest culprit spared. Bec. Let fall what may, I strike not him that's down. My lord archbishop, You come in time to hear the unrighteous banned For crimes reiterate and denounced long since. We sever from the Church the Church's foes, Henceforth to plot outside her. John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, Thomas Fitz-Bernard, Joceline of Salisbury bishop, Hugh St. Clare, De Luci, yokemate in the guilt of others, Joceline of Ballol, and, of baser sort, Bandit, not knight, De Broc, one time a monk. Sirs, write ye down the sentence: be it hung On all the city gates through France and England; From all the altars be it sounded forth With tapers flung to the earth. Scene IX.—A street in Southampton. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Salisbury. B. of Sal. Becket's awake! A storm and in our teeth!— Let us give blow for blow! Gil. My lord, we dare not! That Censure, like a dragon's tongue in the dust, Hath sucked us insects up! The best is cowed: Who swaggered three weeks since, to-day walks softly As one that mourns his mother. Bend we must; I fling me at his feet. B. of Sal. Ill-favoured Fortune Leaves us no choice. Wait we for better winds. Scene X.—Abbey of St. Colombe, near Sens. Becket, Archbishop of Sens, Herbert of Bosham. Arch. of Sens. Your king was fierce against you once, my lord; At last his winter turns to spring. Bec. He changes: His mind's conclusion varies with the times: We have a better augury: his heart Is good, and only on the good in man The better can be built. The king, when crowned At Gloucester, laid his crown upon the altar, And vowed no more to wear it. Late when sick, Deeming death near he chose for burial-place No sepulchre of kings, but some poor church Where slept a saint of God. Her. Meantime o'er England The breath of God hath blown. The Royal Customs Find not this hour an adulating tongue. The bishops, vassals late of servile fear, Through holier fear have burst that baser bond And rush across the sea to pledge new faith. Here comes a friend from Rome;—How stand we there? If well, then all is well. John of Sal. (entering). My lord, ill news! The royal Swearer swore his way through all; Let John of Oxford bear that name for ever! The cardinals stared, the Holy Father doubted; His doubts were vain; once more the Swearer swore, Alternative was none save hollow peace Or war without a foe. Bec. What swore this Swearer? John of Sal. He swore that compact with the antipope Against King Henry charged was false as hell: One youthful cardinal called him ‘Valiant Swearer;’ The rest sat statue-still. Bec. What swore he next? John of Sal. He swore the king should grant the Pope's demands How vast soe'er, the Pope appointing legates To adjudicate our cause. His brother envoys Banned him as traitor: but they railed in English, And so he took no harm. Bec. The Pope replied, ‘Long since, and unsolicited by man, My legate I appointed; he hath judged; Remains but this—to enforce a righteous sentence.’ Replied not thus the Pope? John of Sal. Alas, not so! Bec. Have they no names? those arbiters—those legates? John of Sal. The Cardinal William and the Cardinal Otho. Bec. The first, mine enemy declared; the last, A doubtful friend. Victory in victory's hour, Dries up, like Jonah's gourd! This new commission supersedes the old. How stands the Censure? John of Sal. Men in peril of death Until their case is sifted are absolved. Bec. All Wales aflame once more, who walks not perilled?— The Censure's censured, and my name is made A laughter to the world. John of Sal. This pact is secret; In name your powers remain. [An Attendant enters with a letter for Becket. Bec. From Rouen's bishop. (Reads) ‘“Trust not in princes,” wear they mitre or crown! King Henry maddens with his Roman triumph; He boasts the names of those who clutched his gold Extols the Pope; to England hastes; reports Your office cancelled. ’Write, good Herbert, write— The freedom of speech used by Becket was as great as that tolerated by him. It is thus that he wrote to his envoy at Rome on the appointment of the two legates whose commission virtually suspended his own legatine authority. The translation is that given in Mr. Hurrell Froude's valuable history of Becket's struggle, p. 242: ‘If this be true, then without doubt his lordship the Pope has suffocated and strangled, not only our own person, but himself and every ecclesiastic of both kingdoms; yea, both Churches together, the Gallican and the English. For what will not the kings of the earth dare against the clergy, under cover of this most wretched precedent? And on what can the Church of Rome rely, when it thus deserts and leaves destitute the persons who are making a stand in its cause, and contending for it even unto death.’ In a similar tone is his letter ‘To all the Cardinals’ written on the same occasion. (Ibid. 248-250.) ‘Smooth speeches are not for the wretched, nor guarded words for the bitter in soul. May my bitter thoughts be pardoned, my wretchedness indulged. It is our belief, most holy fathers, that you stand in high places, as God's delegates, to put aside injustice, to cut off presumption, to relieve the sorrowing priesthood, and stop the way against its persecutors; to assist the oppressed and punish the oppressors. . . . Trust then to me, my beloved lords, . . . resume your strength, gird yourselves with the Word of the Most High as with a sword. . . . This is the Royal way, this is the way that leadeth to life, this is the way that you must walk in if ye would follow the footsteps of Jesus Christ and the footsteps of His apostles whose vicars ye are. It is not by craft, it is not by wise schemes that the Church is to be governed, but by justice and by Truth.’ This remarkable freedom of speech neither implied nor was supposed to imply the slightest want of reverence on the part of Becket to the Holy See. Pope. Alexander received it as meekly as Becket himself had received the friendly reproof of his faithful cross-bearer, Llewellen. There's one at least in Rome whom I can trust, One near the Pope—in my name write, and thus: ‘Once more Barabbas is released; once more— No, no; not thus:’ I should not have forgotten; His realm is Christendom's unmeasured orb, That which it is, and that which it shall be; To him earth's kingdoms are but provinces, Revolted some, within his Master's kingdom. He must be patient, lest, in raising one, He spurn its neighbour, tottering. Woe is me! I am an islander with narrow heart, And England-rooted eyes. I see my country, Her laws made null by modern usages, Her Scriptures by traditions slain of men, Her poor down-trampled 'neath a bestial hoof; Yea, scandals worse than these—subverted virtue; Honour, long-outraged, ceasing from its shame; The salt o' the earth daily its savour losing, Self-sentenced to be trodden down by men. Write thus—they'll guess but little how my heart Beneath the words lies bleeding—‘Holy Father! The endurance and the hopes of years are lost; Henceforth what malefactor fears Church censures? Who rises o'er the fear of worldly censors? Sequestrated are seven fair English sees, Abbeys untold.’ Men bid me to be patient! Tell them that time makes patience sin; the years Work for the foe, not us. An Attendant (entering). Two cardinal legates, But late commissioned from the Holy See, Desire my lord the primate. [Cardinal William of Pavia and Cardinal Otho enter. Card. Otho. Please it your Grace, In northward progress to King Henry's court We make delay, zealous once more to see you And learn your Grace's judgment of this time. Bec. My lords, your Eminences both are welcome. John of Salisbury (to the Archbishop of Sens. Was ever change like that? But now his face Was as a tempest's heart; 'tis now a heaven Incapable of cloud. Arch. The princely nature, The oppression past, regains its native calm As by some natural law. Card. Otho. My lord archbishop, A mutinous world uplifts this day its front Against Christ's Vicar! Save this France and England, I know not kingdom sound. The antipope, Propped by the emperor— Bec. Name him not! That puppet, Like frailer favourites of the Imperial fancy, Shall have his day and pass. Card. Will. My lord archbishop, We, uninspired, and shaped of common clay, Can judge the present by the past alone, And deem the Church sore set. Your English king, Faithful till now, at last—we know it—wavers, Nay makes his bargain with the antipope: He was your pupil, through your wisdom wise; He was your playmate, mirthful at your jest: Your minstrel, ever singing of your praise; From height to height he raised you. If he looked For grateful love, a credulous hope is venial: He says that you have raised two realms against him, Flanders, and France. Bec. Your Eminence may hear From sources surer than that insect swarm Which buzzes round the tingling ears of greatness, From Louis, King of France, that from the first I counselled him to peace. Lord cardinal, My sin is this: to stand a living man Where welcomer were a corpse— I, not his flatterers, love my king and serve him Speaking that truth which not to speak to kings, Who seldom hear it, is the crown of treason; Traitors are they, not I. Card. Will. The king complains That you reject as new his Royal Customs. Bec. I bid him to reject that vice of kings Which strangles earliest laws by modern Customs: My lord, that vice is pride; that pride is royal, But not the royallest royalty—not the lasting; I bid him but to fling from him that vice, And reign a great, sane king. Card. Will. A text there is That ‘we are nothing better than our sires:’ Why not, my lord, in general terms engage That what past prelates to their kings conceded Therein you'll stint him not? In days like these, The royal hand a-dipping in your dish, Some plausible pretence— Bec. I ever scorned Your plausible pretence. My lord, that water Wherein of old the unjust judge washed his hands Then when the Just before him stood condemned With crown of mockery and a reed His sceptre, Is extant still on this our earth, and streams Perennial from that fountain-head accursed By him that day infected, through all lands, The bath of service which would serve two masters, The font where specious virtue finds again Her sin original, and to Christ's foe Is unctuously baptized. Barbaric I— Child of the northern forest, not of plains In balms and oil redundant. I long since Have known this thing and scorned it. Card. Will. Lord archbishop, That freedom which the Pope from you permits I need not grudge. In turn I too speak plainly: My lord, through you the Church is ill at ease, All Christendom perturbed. Resign, my lord! Taranto, Southern Italy's chief see, A northern saint its founder, lacks a shepherd, And spreads to you her arms. Bec. Lord cardinal, The chair of Peter in its own good time Shall judge these Royal Customs. When that Voice, At times commixed with baser sounds, sends forth Authentic and oracular o'er the earth Its great award, there lives not who shall bend A humbler forehead to that hest than I. If that award should free from servile yoke My country and her Church, then sit who will In Saint Augustine's chair. If that award Should throne the ill use, Augustine's chair dishonour, I ask no see in Italy or France, By Seine, or Tiber, or the Tyrrhene wave; I claim a hermit's cell 'mid England's woods, Or where her wave-worn rocks are desolate most, Therein to sing my penitential psalms, Poor vespers of a life ill-spent. Till then I flee not from my post. Card. Otho. My lord archbishop, We honour your great heart and manly speech, And bid your Grace farewell. [The cardinals depart, attended by all except John of Salisbury. Bec. (after long musing). Is no one near? John of Sal. My lord, I stand beside you. Bec. In yonder cloudless heaven the sun still shines; The birds sing still; the peasant breaks the clod; Not less a change hath fallen upon the earth— Fear naught! John of Sal. I trust that all may yet go well. Bec. I looked for trials—ay, but not from him:— The good French king will be the next to leave me. (After a pause) All shall go well—but in another sort Than I had hoped till now. My vow is made. ACT IV. Scene I.—The Palace of the Empress Matilda at Rouen. The Empress, Idonea. Empress. Speak on, my child. Windsor's old oaks once more While you discoursed of all your merry staghunts Above me sighed, and kindlier airs than those Which now I breathe with pain. Speak thou; I listen. Had I but had such brother! Yours is dead: Such loss means this, that he—none else—shall walk Beside you still, when all save him are grey, In youth unchanged. Ido. Not Time itself could change him! That light which cheers me still from eyes unseen, That wild sweet smile around imagined lips, A moment's breathless, magic visitation, Which falls upon me like a kiss and flies, Are brighter not with everlasting youth Than was his spirit. Mind he seemed, all mind! In childhood, flower and weed and bird and beast Nature's fair pageant to the eye of others, To him were that and more. Old Bertram said There lurked more insight in his pupil's questions Than in conclusions of the sage self-styled. He never had grown old! Empress. Boyhood might be Fair as that girlhood poet-sung, and bright Besides with action, courage, frank defiance Conquering all ill, nor touched by maiden fear— Oftenest its autumn chokes its spring. I trust Your brother's youth was faithful to his boyhood. Ido. Faithful! O madam, how much more than faithful! Vivacities of young intelligence Were merged, not lost, in kindlings of a soul Where Thought and Love seemed one. He trod an earth The Saviour's; yea, and Mary's. All things shone Beauteous to him, for God shone clear through all: His longing was to free the Tomb of Christ Fighting in Holy Land. Death's early challenge Pleased him as well! ‘Thank God! that Holy Land Was dear,’ he said;—‘more dear, more near, is Heaven!’ Empress (after a long silence). At twenty years—had my son died at twenty— The last great day alone can answer that: I did my best that time: I did it late To stay that fatal war 'twixt him and Becket Which inly wastes him like an atrophy— Thenceforth you were alone. Ido. Not that first month: Near me that time he seemed—a spiritual nearness Impossible, I think, to flesh and blood: Terrestrial life returned. 'Twas then I wept. Empress. Peace came at last. Ido. 'Twas in a church, one even: The choir had closed their books; but still on high Rolled on the echoes of their last ‘Amen.’ Something within me sobbed, ‘Amen, so be it.’ I wept no more. Empress. Nay, nay, the dead have claims: I love not those who cheat them of their due. Child, grief is grief. Ido. I clasped it as God's gift, And 'twixt my bosom and my arms it vanished. Some wound seemed staunched. My body still was weak: Wintry the woods: yet in my soul the more God's happy spring made way. Slowly within me My childhood's wish returned—to live a nun: I deemed it first presumption; yea temptation; It changed to hope. Faint was that hope, and like The greening verge of some young tree in March, When all its bulk is dark. Empress. With such a brother Either you ne'er had stooped to earthly love, Or love in you had lacked its earthlier part: You hoped to be a nun: at last hope conquered. Ido. By hindrance helped. I seem to you unwedded: Yet when the irrevocable vow was breathed 'Twas as a bride I felt—His bride, for Whom Love grows divine through unreserved Obedience. My brother too—while we were children both, In loving, I obeyed him. Some there were Who mocked me with the name of ‘Little wife.’ I weep him still; yet laugh at mine own tears Knowing that he I weep is throned in heaven. Empress. A more than kingly lot! Ido. And yet how great Is each day's commonest lot when judged aright! Our convent looks on cottage-sprinkled vales: Far, far below, now winds the marriage pomp, The funeral now. O, who could see such things, Nor help the world with prayer? Empress. What see you, child? Ido. An Eden, weed-o'ergrown, but still an Eden; Man's noble life—a fragment, yet how fair! My father, pilgrim once in southern lands, Groping 'mid ruins found a statue's foot, And brought it home. I gazed upon it oft Until its smiling curves and dimpled grace Showed me the vanished nymph from foot to brow, Majestical and sweet. Man's broken life Shows like that sad, sweet fragment. Empress. Life, my child, In times barbaric is a wilderness: In cultured times a street, or wrangling mart: We bear it, for we must. 'Tis best in youth: The weariness of life perplexes age: The dust accumulate is worse than anguish: We know not where the stain, but feel all stain. (Looks at her long and adds) O'er you some fifteen years may pass like five: Die then if you are wise. Ido. O madam, madam, God made man's life: it is a holy thing! What builds us up that life? The Virtues, first; That sisterhood divine, brighter than stars, And diverse more than stars, than gems, than blossoms; Diverse, yet each so wonderful, so fair: The Virtues are our life in essence; next, Those household ties which image ties celestial; Lastly, life's blessed sorrows. These alone Rehearse the Man of Sorrows; these alone Fit us for life with Him. Empress. To you man's life Is prospect, child: to me 'tis retrospect: They that best know it neither love nor hate: It hath affections, sorrowful things and sweet: My share was mine, as daughter and as mother: It hath its duties, stately taskmasters, Exacting least in age, when, thanks to God, At last the unselfish heart is forced upon us Our time for joy gone by. It hath its cares: It hath its passions—mine was once ambition; And, lastly, it hath death. Ido. And death is peace. Empress. Then death and sleep are things, alas, unlike: Unpeaceful dreams make my nights terrible— Pale spectres of past days. Last night I seemed Once more, as one whom midnight dangers scare, To rush 'mid blinding snows with frozen feet O'er the rough windings of an ice-bound river, The shout of them that chased me close behind, The wolf-cry in the woods. Ido. That flight from London, Madam, was yours in sleep. Empress. Once more I dreamed: Once more I fled through false and perjured lands, Insurgent coasts of rebels vowed to slay me; I lay within a coffin, on a bier, With feet close tied. Fierce horsemen galloped past; At times the traveller or the clown bent o'er me, And careless said, ‘A corpse.’ Ido. In such sad seeming You 'scaped from Bristol. Empress. Worse, far worse, remained; I heard once more the widows' wail at Gloucester; At Winchester and Worcester once again Above the crackling of the blazing roofs I heard the avenging shout that hailed me queen, And, staying not the bloodshed, shared the sin. That hour of dream swelled out to centuries; A year so racked would seem eternity:— Our penance may prove such. Ido. Madam, your strength— Empress. A place there is which fits us for that heaven Where nought unclean can live: else were we hopeless. How think you of that region? Ido. Madam, thus: That bourne is peace, since therein every will Is wholly one with His, the Will Supreme; Is gladness, since deliverance there is sure; Is sanctity, since punishment alone Of sin remains—sin's every wish extinct— And yet is pain not less. Empress. There should be pain;— Speak on; speak truth; I ne'er had gifts of fancy: Truth is our stay in life, and more in death. Ido. 'Tis pain love-born, and healed by love. On earth Best Christian joy is joy in tribulations: In that pure realm our grief hath root in joy: 'Tis pain of love that grieves to see not God. Empress. Here too sin hides from us God's face; yet here Feebly we mourn that loss. Ido. So deeply here Man's spirit is infleshed! Two moments are there Wherein the soul of man beholds its God; The first at its creation, and the next The instant after death. Empress. It sees its Judge. Ido. And, seeing, is self-judged, and sees no longer:— Readers of the higher poetry will hardly need to be reminded of a passage in Cardinal Newman's ‘Dream of Gerontius,’ by which, or by Saint Catherine of Genoa's beautiful Treatise on Purgatory, this line was probably suggested. Yet rests in perfect peace. As some blind child, Stayed in its mother's bosom, feels its safety, So in the bosom of the love eterne, Secure, though sad, it waits the eternal Vision, The over-bending of that Face divine Which now—now first—it knows to be its heaven, That primal thirst of souls at last re-waked, The creature's yearning for its great Creator. Empress. Pray that these pains may help me towards that Vision! Till these my later years I feared not death: Death's magnanimity, as death draws nigh, Subdues that fear. My hope is in the Cross. Whate'er before me lies, the eternal justice Will send my pain, the eternal love console, And He who made me prove at last my peace. I hope so: at my best I think 'tis so. Farewell! Return at morn; your words, your looks Have brought me help. Be with me when I die. Scene II.—Palace of Woodstock. King Henry, John of Oxford. K. Hen. All's well; and then all's ill;—who wars on Becket Hath January posting hard on May, And night at ten o' the morn. That man regains Whate'er we snatch: he's dangerous in retreat. Three times I conquered; first with rotten aid Of his own bishops in this realm of England; At Rome through help from you when hope seemed gone; Lastly at Montmirail. Now comes the change: Those new-sent envoys bend their brows above me; Impeach me with bad faith; aver the Censures Conditionally only were removed; Remind me of your oaths at Rome! John of Oxf. If humbly Your Highness sues their leave to wear that crown Bequest of kings who bowed not to the crosier, The primate wins. So be it! K. Hen. Bequest of kings! There's none of them that dared what I have dared! They ruled a realm and shared that realm with priests: I rule an empire; made and rule an empire Which in the West shall one day pass in girth That Frederick's in the East. How bind, how fuse it, If every bishop reigns, a lesser king, And every baron? To the dust with such! My empire is an empire ruled by laws, Not warring wills; but, mark you, royal laws, The efflux of one royal will forth flowing Like rivers through the land! John of Oxf. There spake a king! To speed that great design, I, priest myself, For many a year, not caring who cried ‘shame,’ Have given you help—that help a priest alone Sagacious through the labyrinth still to scent The tortuous trail of priestcraft, could have given. Sir, at this hour you stand in dangers worse Thrice than your dangers past. A cry goes up Not from the poor alone. Your barons, vexed By scutage tax in place of warlike service, Fair lands flung wide to judges sent on circuit, Sharp lawyers prying into privilege, This day more hate you than they love church-lands: The Pope grows strong, and with his strength his courage; While Becket, sager for defeats foregone, Comes hard on victory's goal. K. Hen. A synod, John— At Clarendon I'll call it three months hence. John of Oxf. The bishops will be wary. Synods now Spawn but disputes; the last was ill-attended. Old Winton, summoned, answered that the canons Forbad appeal from greater powers to less: ‘And I,’ he said, ‘now old and grey, have had That greater summons from my Master, God, Whose judgment I await.’ K. Hen. Within your eye I see a counsel glimmering. Speak it, John! John of Oxf. Your Highness needs some measure stringent, strong, Some act to astonish foes, and hearten friends;— Yet, venturing such, before you imminent There looms an Interdict. K. Hen. And that were ruin. John of Oxf. Hear now my counsel! Crown your son, Prince Henry! The boy will be your puppet-king;—the Pope Must count him king in act. Work then your will No Interdict strikes him, or his. K. Hen. 'Twere hard— To crown a king is Canterbury's right By law and usage both. John of Oxf. That stands provided! You willed to crown the prince when eight year old: That day the Pope granted a dispensation, And bade you choose your bishop. Canterbury Lacked then, 'tis true, a primate. What of that? A precedent was made;—the rest be mine. Send me to Rome: the Curia seeks no triumph The Pope shall learn that, grieved at errors past You from your greatness have deposed yourself To fight in Holy Land. K. Hen. The Pope consent! John of Oxf. He still may count that dispensation binding For Popes are scrupulous ofttimes to their loss: If, pressed by Becket, he should call it back We act at once upon his earlier mandate, And brand as forged all later. Should he send one Unless 'tis publicly, in the face of day Lodged in the bishops' hands, and thus made binding, Such mandate they may spurn. K. Hen. Which fraud exposed, Becket will launch his bolt. John of Oxf. O never, never That bolt shall Becket launch— K. Hen. I keep him barred From England's shores. Not less that bolt would scorch them. John of Oxf. We have reached the inmost kernel of my scheme. Some six weeks since—so rumour ran—you stood All day in stormy conference with your bishops: At eve a stranger, gliding through the dusk, Lodged in the royal hand an unsigned letter, On reading which you smiled. K. Hen. Its words were these: ‘Better that Becket stood on England's shores Than roamed the world at will.’ John of Oxf. I wrote that letter. K. Hen. Craftiest of counsellors, I see your drift! You mean—a dungeon. Henry crowned, the primate, Or wrathful, or to win his pupil back, Will hasten to this land. John of Oxf. Your Highness then Hunting in merry Maine! A dungeon—yes— Worse than a dungeon would be worse for us— Sir, have no fear! The ship that veers advances: We have made our losing tack; the good tack next. [Queen Eleanor enters with her ladies. The glory and the grace of female beauty, Consummate, and mature, and crowned a Queen! Q. Elea. (advancing to the king with a parrot on her wrist). Lo, here my new-taught mocker! Learn like him! Speak, painted prophet!—‘Thomas is a fool!’ Scene III.—A wood close to the Abbey of St. Colombe, near Sens. Herbert of Bosham, alone. Her. Since Nature, God's fair daughter, wreathes at times The Church's fillet o'er her laughing eyes, And, masked in livery of her graver sister, Like her would teach us—learn we of her lore! What means this flower? Men call it Columbine; A tassel-toy. Yet, pluck, save one, its purples, And lo, that remnant left puts on the dove! Blossom to bird is changed! The meaning's plain: Weed out your joys; cast off redundancies: Deflower the pomps and shows of secular life; Then at their core you reach the wingèd greatness! The passion-flower itself— John of Sal. (arriving). Hail, ancient friend! Her. Far-travelled seer, welcome from all the lands! How speak they of our primate? John of Sal. Much, and ill: The magnates of the State fear and dislike him; The magnates of the Church admire yet fear; With instinct from above the poor are with him. Her. 'Tis ever thus! In Castle Rockingham, When like a stag at bay old Anselm stood The Red King glaring at him in lust of blood, What help was his from prelate or from peer? The council-hall was as a captured city: The bishops hung their heads. Then from the crowd An old grey man stepped forth, and knelt, and said, ‘Father, thy children bid thee have no fear: The poor man's prayer is strong!’ John of Sal. Not slacker of help Pope Urban was to Anselm than, this hour, His successor to Thomas. Herbert, Herbert! The Church errs never; but her rulers err: They lack the earth-wisdom of the secular lords. Her. The errors of the rulers of the Church At times more serve her than their happiest prudence. 'Tis true they cause her trials:—what of that? God sends her strength proportioned to those trials, And makes her feel that strength is His alone. Statesmen do penance here on earth for errors;— A later, sterner Court shall judge their sins: The Church wears sackcloth here on earth for sins; The sinless error hurts her not: it breeds Her pains of growth—no more. John of Sal. That slowness frets me! Her. Her slowness means her greatness. Statesmen play Still the short game, because their time is short, She that endures, the long one. 'Tis her nature, Her nature, and God's law, not her design: She cannot mass her total force in front: Too manifold is it, and too deeply hidden; Reserves she hath. Some tyrant's luckless craft Forth drags them; and, his victory all but won, He finds his war beginning; near life's end Finds it once more beginning. John of Sal. Henry's craft Deceives no more. Faith gravitates t'ward Becket; But men of faith grow rarer. Her. God, O God! How diverse showed those twain when first they warred, And how that first diversity hath grown With fleeting of the years! At Montmirail That truth o'ershone me like a lightning flash! Not then, as at Northampton, Becket towered A terror to his foes. By all forsaken He made no boast of self. In patient sadness With neck a little bent and forward head, Six hours he stood beneath that scourge of tongues: He spake but this; ‘I swear to serve my king, Saving the honour of the King of kings: Who swears to more is Pagan and a slave.’ I saw that God had sent his soul that hour A soul's supremest trial—Dereliction: The fountains of the mighty deep of woe Were broken up: the joy of Faith was dead: Yet Faith itself lived on. 'Mid storm and darkness He clung to God as limpet to the rock;— He's greater than he was: the grace of Orders Makes increase in his spirit. John of Sal. It were time He sued the Pope once more. Her. He never sues him, Though loyalest of his sons. He trusts in God And broods not much on counsels for the future. When late I spake of such, he smiled and said ‘There was an hour beside Saint Denys' tomb: 'Twas then you deemed our fortunes touched their highest: It is not, friend, from thrones of kings or popes Issues man's hope, but from the martyr's grave.’ John of Sal. Herbert, the fault is yours—your fault—your folly! One day you'll wreck us. Yes, the fault is yours! Should Thomas catch from you— Her. No word from me Hath Thomas heard to fire the martyr's zeal. John of Sal. Ever you praise man's life; yet ever muse How, innocently, man may soonest leave it: All which the juncture needeth you ignore. Herbert, see that which is !—you gaze for aye On pictures in the air. Her. Which they see not Who, dazzled, watch that merriest house on fire A world in dotage hastening to its doom. John of Sal. Am I a worldling? Her. Nay, but half, good John; Worldling with heavenward aim. John of Sal. Herbert, you know As little of the world as of the flesh— Of each not more, I ween, than of the Devil: Let the world be. Her. Things are there he knows best Who knows them only slightly, and at distance. Well, well, the world is fair—this day at least;— Ay, and the life of man is worth the living! So deem that bannered choir of youths and maids: O how the heart springs forth on wings to meet them! Glad hearts sing there! And yet they'll only learn In heaven how fair a thing was earthly life! Peasants (pass near singing). Hark, the Spring! She calls! With a thousand voices 'Mid the echoing forest-halls One great heart rejoices! Hills where young lambs bound Whiten o'er with daisies: Flag-flowers light the lower ground Where the old steer grazes. Meadows laugh, flower-gay; Every breeze that passes Waves the seed-cloud's gleaming grey O'er the greener grasses. O thou Spring! be strong, Exquisite new-comer! And the onset baffle long Of advancing Summer! John of Sal. Herbert, farewell! Within I seek the primate: New treasons rise, which to forestall, the Pope Sends mandates to my Lords of York and London: The Swearer saw him late—that means a storm. [John of Salisbury departs. Her. (alone). John has great virtues—not the chief, like Becket's, Since worldly men can understand them half— Yet great ones since they take no stain from praise. How kind is Providence! To one like me, Strengthless, a Christian fabler more than Christian, Flatteries of men, reverence from hostile kings, And all the sleek lubricities of Fortune, Had proved a flower-decked pitfall. For that cause Such things pass by our sort. Scene IV.—The Abbey of St. Colombe. Becket, alone. Bec. Each day more clearly, like two mighty peaks Of one veiled mountain, shine two truths before me: My hope is not from England—that I learned Deserted at Northampton: not from Rome— Deserted when those legates, later missioned, Cancelled my two years' work, and from me hurled A penitent realm, returning. Not from France— Deserted by her king. That hour, methinks, I stood within Death's porch. That hour, it may be, Some inmost ill, my soul's chief Tempter, died. Twice was the victory from my hand down dashed When all but won. Immeasurably Rome helps me—needs she must— Simply by being—merely by existence; Help me by act she cannot. She doth well: To invoke her now were base. But thou, my country, The on-rolling centuries, whose fateful hands Shall bind the purple or the death-robe round thee, Engrain their deep-dyed tissue here, and now! Thy son I am not less than Christian bishop: Thy martyr, if God wills it, I would die. [Llewellen enters. A legate's powers are mine as yet: I use them. These be the Papal mandates. Place them, friend, Within their hands—the hands of York and London; But when the eyes of men are on them set: Your labour else is vain. Llew. It shall be done. [Departs. Bec. There should have been no need to send those missives— I must not think it. Once I was unjust. The Pope sits throned upon the Church's tower; Sees all: I fight below: my time is short, And in it much to expiate. I must act. (After a pause) I strove for justice, and my Mother's honour; For these at first. Now know I that God's Truth Is linked with these as closely as body and soul. Scene V.—Abbey of St. Colombe. Archbishop of Sens, Herbert of Bosham. Arch. of Sens. Herbert! your legate must be told these rumours: I trust he'll soon return. Your king is sudden: The tidings of his march and victory reach us Like runners matched. That slender, sinewy frame, That ardent eye, that swift on-striding step, Yet graceful as a tiger's, foot descending Silent but sure on the predestinate spot— From signs like these looks forth the inward man. Expect grave news ere long. 'Twill task the legate; Yea, though his greatness patent is to all, 'Twill task it sore. Her. So best! 'Twill task to crown it! My lord, fear naught: I knew him in old days: I saw that greatness hid, though thick its veil, In every gesture of his soul and body. 'Twas at Northampton first it rose to height, Not when he cried, ‘I spurn your Customs new,’ But when he said, ‘I sinned, and sin no more.’ Nor ends it there: all this was prologue merely: As o'er the petty pomps of earthly pride Rises the heroic greatness, so in grade Loftier, the saintly springs o'er that to heaven, A Tree of Life whose leaves shall heal sick lands. I shall not die till Thomas is a Saint; And then we'll die together. Lo, he comes! [Becket enters. Arch. of Sens. My lord, you have heard those rumours: they are grave. Bec. Your Grace is gloomier than your wont, and show Less than yourself therein. My lord, that bishop Who crowns, in scorn of great Augustine's right, An English king, stands excommunicate. I deem these rumours idle things. The Pope To bar all danger, issued letters thrice, First from Anagni, from the Lateran next, And last from Alba, to our English bishops: I saw no need for such. Arch. of Sens. A whisper stirs That instruments consenting to that deed, The sigil of the Fisherman appended, Were forged by John of Oxford. Others say He won the Pope's consent long since by fraud; His fraud exposed, that sanction was withdrawn; But to those instruments consent withdrawing The English ports are closed. Bec. My lord, fear naught! Remember Montmirail! There stood I sole The good French king—nay, Rome itself against me: More late the Roman envoys saw the snare: The King of France—I sought him out at Sens: The account given by Canon Morris of the interview between Becket and the two kings at Montmirail includes much that is characteristic: ‘Before the conference began, St. Thomas was surrounded by his friends, who, almost unanimously, tried to induce him to make his submission to King Henry absolutely, adding no condition or clause, and leaving all the matter in dispute to the king's generosity. . . . Herbert of Bosham managed to thrust himself in amongst the crowd of great people to whisper a warning to the saint that, if he omitted the clause “saving God's honour” now, he would be sure afterwards to repent it as bitterly as he had done the omission of the former clause in England. There was not time for him to answer by more than a look when they were in the presence of the kings.’ Henry addressed Louis. ‘This speech produced a great effect. Some people called out, “The king humbles himself enough.” The archbishop was silent for a while, when Louis said, in a way which delighted the friends of the King of England, “My Lord Archbishop, do you want to be more than a saint? or better than Peter? Why do you doubt? Peace is at hand.” . . . The majority even of his own followers were led away by the current feeling, and were jealous of losing the restoration to their homes, which had seemed just within their grasp. As they were riding away after the conference the horse of one of them, named Henry de Hoctune, who was riding just before the Archbishop, stumbled, on which the rider called out, loud enough for the saint to hear, “Go on, saving the honour of God, and of holy Church, and of my Order.” Here again the Archbishop, much as he was pained, did not speak.’ The poor never forsook him. ‘As they went, people asked who it was that was going by; and when they heard that it was the Archbishop of Canterbury, they pointed him out to one another, saying “That is the Archbishop who yesterday would not deny God or neglect His honour for the sake of the kings.” Soon after all was changed. King Louis discovered that Henry had deceived him; and one of the Papal envoys, Bernard of Grammont, said to Herbert, “I would rather have my foot cut off than that your lord the Archbishop should have made peace at that conference, as I and all the others advised him.”’ With head bent low in heaviness he sat: I deemed myself once more an exiled man: One moment, and he knelt before my feet; ‘You, you alone,’ he cried, ‘that day had eyes; Blind were we all;—except that youthful prince, You have not a friend in England.’ (To Llewellen, entering) Ha, good scout! How sped you on your way? Llew. My errand failed. Bec. No fault of yours, good friend! Llew. By night I landed, And sped to London in a beggar's garb: Day after day, in banquet hall and church, I strove to reach my Lords of York and London; They knew the danger near and stood on guard: At last I sought my Lord of London's house: Slowly the bishop crossed the court in prayer, And, reading, cast at times a sidelong glance: I knelt me down, and raised the Papal missive: He deemed it some petition; softly took it;— Ere long he learned the truth. Bec. But not in public? Llew. The humbleness in his regard grew sour; Yet wroth he seemed not: ‘From the Pope—a mandate! Knowing the parchment forged, I read it not: The Pope's authentic mandate is with us.’ He spake, and tossed it from him, and passed by. In rushed the prince with mummers, and I 'scaped; Else had my lot been hard. Bec. What next befell? Llew. At morn the king was knighted by his father, And crowned at stroke of noon. Bec. By whom? Llew. By one Who little liked his office, Roger of York. Bec. His time will come. That coronation oath At least bears witness 'gainst the ‘Royal Customs;’ The prince made oath to guard the Church's freedom— Pray God he guard it better than his sire! Llew. That sentence from his oath was razed: the bishops Who crowned him sware to keep the Royal Customs! Bec. (rising suddenly). The mask is off! Thank God, 'tis off for ever! (After a pause) No more of that. Proceed! The prince was crowned. Llew. The rest was naught but jubilee and triumph, Wine-fountains, pealing bells, the bonfires' glare, The tournament, and charging of the steeds In the ordered lists. High up, o'er-canopied By cloth of gold, refulgent sat the queen; Her ladies round her in a silken haze Like the moon's halo round the moon, when night On hills of Wales— Her. Let be your hills of Wales; The feast? You saw it? Llew. Ay, in minstrel's garb: The tables groaned with gold: I scorned the pageant! The Norman pirates and the Saxon boors Sat round and fed: I hated them alike The rival races, one in sin. Alone We Britons tread our native soil. Her. Both kings Were present? Llew. There a merry chance befell: King Henry stood behind his son, and served. ‘Give thanks, young prince,’ my Lord of York brake forth, ‘For ne'er till now—’ ‘Is it strange,’ the boy replied, If by an earl's son a king's son is served?’ The great hall roared with laughter; high o'er all His father's voice! Bec. How like my youthful pupil! God bless the child! I am glad he wears the crown! God grant him grace! Arch. of Sens. Grave tidings these, my lord! Bec. My lord, you take me back from morn to night. The coronation's naught; we are hurt elsewhere. That Oath to keep the Church in liberty, That baptism vow of England Christian made, That bridal pledge of England wed to Christ, That sister link 'twixt her and Christendom, Whose holy kingdoms weep henceforth her fall; That oath, that vow, that pledge, that link all-blessèd, The birthright of the nations ere their birth, The talisman which 'mid their youthful struggles Charmed them from fate and saved them from themselves; Which still for suffering weakness found defence In the great conscience of Humanity Impersonate in God's Church and armed and missioned;— Lo, where that Oath is dashed aside, cast off Unceremoniously as a shifted robe Or banquet-trencher changed, or rotted bandage Foul from a wound and flung into the filth! This thing no comment bears: too grave it is For wrath or further speech. I go to England. Scene VI.—A house in Freitval. Leicester, Cornwall. Leic. This meeting of the primate and the kings Must bring the end. Our king shall make or mar In measure as the course he takes to-morrow Be true or false. Corn. For years I have not seen Such health on Henry's brow. That coronation Which raised the boy to monarch, changed not less His father to a boy. Leic. Cornwall! that deed Was worse than questionable. Triumphant acts Consummated at last and on the sudden, Yea though of sin compact, with omens black, Are not alone achievement but deliverance And fire the heart like wine— A load's removed; and, like a ship upspringing Then when the o'er-blown mast is hacked away, The spirit regains its port erect and rushes, Though maimed, before the storm. Conscience expelled, Conscience long labouring, and at last expelled, Is next in strength to conscience crowned a king:— Which strength this day is Henry's? Corn. Which? I care not! Enough that strength he hath. Leic. Strength to waste strength: He hath sold his great ambitions for a dream! He might have conquered Scotland ere this hour: We battle still 'mid marches bleak of Wales Whose war-cries scare our sleeping babes. There's Ireland! He scarce was crowned when Adrian blessed that suit: Three years ago, Dermod, her woman-stealer, Knelt to our king. His hands were full of Becket: He might have conquered Ireland in six months; Conquered and raised; or else with continent heart Trampled Ambition's letch and left her bloodless. He found a baser path: he farmed his feud To bandit barons: bade them cross the sea And ravin where they listed. Corn. Wary and wise! These barons soon will sorely need his aid: Then comes his time! Leic. Cornwall! They'll win and keep; Now cut a prince's throat; now wed a princess: Our king is vowed and sworn to Law and Order: They'll brook no law that stands betwixt their greed And serfs, their prey. Fitz-Stephen laughed of late While Dermod danced o'er true men foully slain; They'll laugh more loud when Outlawry not Law, And clans war-mad, secure to them their lands Sans need of aid from England. I discern A deep'ning cancer bred from Ireland's heart Yet hollowing England's breast. Corn. Those Letters Patent, 'Tis true, gave licence large. I scarcely guess— Leic. 'Twas granted half in hope, and half in fear: This Becket-war offends the greater nobles: He dare not trust them: Chester—Arundel— Frown when they name him: Oxford calls him upstart. Barons that starve and disaffected priests, On such alone securely he relies. His Customs! What were we, princes of England, If pledged to recognize as law and right Casual concessions filched or bought, if tried In hostile courts, and not before our peers? Better be collared with the old Saxon ring; Wear name of Serf and Thrall! Corn. In that we holp him: Northampton's castle— Leic. Sir, we have our penance! Young Harry's crowned! In guerdon of our help We are ruled by babes! Good father-king, beware You light a fire that soon will reach your roof! From this beginning wars on wars shall rise. The prince is proud; will scorn to reign, a puppet; Discord will spread: first sons against their sire, Brother 'gainst brother next will dash in frenzy: The inveterate habit, hate, will prey within; The wound, skinned o'er, break out again in blood A river rushing on from reign to reign, Till on the far, predestinate field at last Plantagenet's great race makes shameful end While some large-fisted boor or blear-eyed knave Steals the dishonoured crown. If any Fury Hates Henry's house, she fixed on it her eye Then when this strife began. Corn. I hate this Becket;— He is the Church's champion. Leic. Friend, you err: I thought with you; but years have taught me better: Becket was fanatic never though once proud: Salisbury's old bishop says ‘he's dangerous, Yet dangerous not as tortuous, but as simple And passionate for the honour of his charge: The State, not Church, that charge, he had not failed To vindicate her right.’ Corn. I serve the king; My thought ends there. Leic. Cornwall, I also serve him;— Would I had served him with less servile service: Our course hath scarce been knightly, nay, scarce Christian: Our service hath disserved him to his shame. Scene VII.—The ‘Traitor's Meadow’ near Freitval. Llewellen, Fitz-Stephen. Llew. These princes and these prelates keep not time: Each fears to come the first. Fitz-Ste. Lo, there our king: The French king not. That ‘kiss of peace,’ withheld From Becket, moves his spleen. 'Mid Henry's train I see that beast, Fitz-Urse. Llew. Right opposite Rides Becket; at his left Earl Theobald, And Sens' Archbishop at his right. Fitz-Ste. The king Makes speed to meet him, with uncovered head: And lo, with what a zeal he grasps his hand! Now they embrace. Was that the kiss of peace? Llew. Not so:—the king's horse swerved. Beasts have true instincts. K. Hen. The unhappy, sour, and anger-venomed time, By craft of others clouded and confused, Hath drifted past us; and once more shines out The sky of earlier days. Papal ambitions Drave in betwixt us, Thomas! Bec. Sire, my king, Those cloudy days at times had better gleams; Their summer promise, like a witch's gold, Still left me poorer. K. Hen. Nay, not promises! Forward I ever was to speak my hopes; Slow to pledge grace. Bec. Beneath Montmartre you pledged it: The French king heard you and my Lord of Sens And many a French and English knight beside. I prayed for restitution of those lands From Canterbury torn. It pleased your Highness To grant that prayer; yet till this hour that pledge Lies void as bankrupt's bond. K. Hen. This must be looked to. Bec. I made another and a weightier suit: Those benefices dowered for God's high worship And temporal service of the poor of Christ, By sacrilegious barons clutched and sold To trencher priests the Church's scourge and scandal, For these I made demand. It pleased your Highness To pledge your word that rapine should surcease: Sire, for two little months the plague was stayed; Then burst it forth anew. K. Hen. They hid it from me. Bec. The vacant abbeys, widowed bishoprics Glut still the royal coffers. K. Hen. Some, I think, Have gained true shepherds late: the rest shall win them. I made delay fearing lest rash elections Might vex the Church's peace. Bec. To me and mine Return was promised to our native land Where rest the bones of them who went before us: Your coasts are closed against us; and my friends— Of hunger many, more of grief have died In alien lands, and sleep in nameless graves. K. Hen. Now by the Saints of Anjou and of Maine, England to you is open as this hand, And hath been since that coronation-day Which made your pupil king. Bec. Your Highness touches Our latest wrong. The see of Canterbury Hath privilege sole to crown our English kings: My Lord of York usurped that dignity Crowning your son. K. Hen. The Conqueror's self was crowned By York's Archbishop, not by holy Stigand Primate that day. My grandfather was crowned By Hereford's bishop. Bec. Stigand had not won From Rome the pallium, and the see was vacant: Hereford's bishop served in Anselm's place, An exile then for God. Anselm, returned, Re-crowned the ill-crowned king. K. Hen. By Anjou's Saints, Your bishops snared me. Let them pay the forfeit! Bec. My Lords of York and London are suspended: May it please your Highness plainly to declare If you confirm that sentence? K. Hen. I confirm it! 'Tis three times ratified. I tell you, Thomas, I'll have the old times again. The princess scorned Unction not yours: ere long your hands shall crown her, Your hands re-crown my son. Bec. Alas! the grief To win all rights, all but the best, the dearest! You make no mention of the— K. Hen. Name them not! This day is festal: bring no cloud upon it! Bec. O would that I had never heard them named, Ne'er seen them blazoned— K. Hen. Thomas, on English shores All wrongs shall be made right. Bec. A morn there was— Your Highness then had scarce been three months king— When, in a window of your Woodstock palace— The birds were singing 'mid the bowers below— We read some history of pagan days; It pierced your heart: you started up: you cried, ‘Thrice better were these pagans than your saints! They loved their native land! They set their eyes On one small city, small but yet their mother, And died in its defence!’ K. Hen. Again I say it! Bec. I answered thus; ‘They knew the State alone: They played at dim rehearsals, yet were true To truth then man's. They gazed with tearful eyes Not on their city only, but that rock, Its marble mother which above it soared Crowned with that city's fortress and its fanes: Beyond their gods lived on the “God Unknown:” Above base mart and popular shout survived The majesty of law.’ K. Hen. 'Tis true. Thus spake you. Bec. But added this:—‘Our God is not unknown: In omnipresent majesty among us His Church sits high upon her rock tower-crowned, Fortress of Law divine and Truth Revealed, Enthroned o'er every city, realm, and people! Had we the man-heart of the men of old, With what a spirit of might invincible For her should we not die!’ K. Hen. With tears you spake it. Bec. Then judge me justly, O my king, my friend, Casting far from you, like a sundered chain, A thought abhorred, an ignominy down-trodden, The oppression of dead error. Say, shall I, A Christian bishop, and a subject sworn, Be pagan more than pagan, doubly false— False to a heavenly kingdom throned o'er earth, False to an earthly kingdom raised to heaven, And ministering there high on the mount of God 'Mid those handmaiden daughters of a King The kingdoms and the nations of this world, Who gird the Queen gold-vested? Pagans, sire, Lived not, though dark, in Babylonian blindness: The laws of that fair city which they loved Subjecting each man, raised him and illumed. We too are citizens of no mean City: Her laws look forth on us from rite and creed: In her we venerate Man's Race Redeemed, Which—cleansed from bestial, and ill spirits expelled— In unity looks down on us, God's Church, The Bride of Christ beside the great King throned, Yea by His sceptre stayed. My king, my friend! I have done to you no wrong! My many sins Lay otherwhere. Tenfold their compt would rise If, sane myself, I pandered to your madness. K. Hen. Thomas, you lack what only might convert me: Could you be England's King, her primate I, Your part I too would play! Bec. And O how nobly And unlike me in fashion you would play it! How petty my discourse hath been till now: Sir, see these things as you will one day see them! Two lots God places in the hand of each: We choose; and oft we choose the lot least loved. Least, though the headlong moment's whim or passion Yields it a moment's crown: The youth who slays life's hope in random pleasures Knows not that deep within his heart—far deeper Than all base cravings—those affections live Which sanctified his father's home. Years pass: Sad memories haunt the old man in his house, Sad shadows strike the never-lighted hearth, Sad echoes shake the child-untrodden floors: A great cry issues from his famished heart— ‘I spurned the lot I loved.’ K. Hen. My youth is past: It had its errors; yet within my house Are voices young and sweet. Bec. God keep them such! Far better silence and the lonely halls Than war-cries round the hearth. God guard your children! If you have risen against the Church, your mother, God guard them from revolt against their sire! I spake not, sir, of errors in your youth: A parable was mine. The soul's revolt is deadlier than the body's: Sir, that revolt is pride. In time, beware! That God who shapes us all to glorious end Proffered to you a glory beyond glory: Your heart's chief yearning was a new Crusade: Spurn not true greatness for a phantom greatness! Your flatterers are your danger: them you trust: You fear the Church: to her you owe your all: From her you gat your crown. K. Hen. That word is true: The Church and Theobald, and you not less, Propped me at need. What then? A king perforce Reveres the ancient ways. Bec. O never in you Was tender reverence for the ancient ways! Another mind is yours, a different will, An adverse aim;—that aim I deem not base: There's greatness in it; but your means are ruthless. You love your children; there's your sum of love; Yours are the passions which torment our clay, The intellect and the courage which exalt it, The clear conception of a state and empire— Yet seen but from below. To raise that state You crush all ancient wont, all rights and heights: Your kingdom you would level to a plain O'erlooked by one hill only, and, thereon The royal tent. K. Hen. God made my heart ambitious. Bec. Then be ambitious with a high ambition! You scorn the lofty daring. Lions nigh, You hunt the forest vermin. K. Hen. Thomas, Thomas! We kings should tender more our country's peace Than any personal greatness. Bec. Royal sir, Play not the sophist with yourself or God: You, you alone have marred your country's peace, Sapping her faith! Faith is a nation's safety. Remember, sir, the ‘Battle of the Standard!’ The Scotch king, David, harried all the North: No king against him marched: 'twas mitred Thurlston: The freemen of the people round him flocked: High in a chariot central 'mid that host Hung the great banners of four English Saints— Not Saints, Lord King, of Anjou or of Maine— Cuthbert of Durham, John of Beverley, Wilfred of Ripon, Peter named of York: The cry of Albin swept the world before it! Alone that chariot with its banners stood: Back fell the astonished clans, and Carlisle's towers Heard their last wail. K. Hen. Barbaric days, my friend! Turn we to nearer themes. You deem me false, I know, to friendship old. Impute that fault To friendship's self. I looked to you for help: I found my friend my foe. Bec. I ne'er deceived you: I taught you from the first the Church's rights, Therein through zeal offending your great mother Who sleeps in God, and moving oft your spleen; Taught you that nations were not ravening beasts, Each with its separate spoil and will unquestioned, But sisters in the bond of Christendom: I told you pagan nations knew two laws, Domestic—civil; Christian nations three, Domestic, civil, apostolical; Man, that begins a family, through grace Dilating to the family of Christ, His utmost limit, and his nature's crown;— Three spheres engird man's life: I said that none Might wrong the lesser, none affront the greater: You knew my heart; from first to last you knew it: You thought the world would change it; for which cause You willed me primate. K. Hen. Ay, and curse that madness! I spurn alike your parables and sermons: I rule my land alone! No more of this! (After a pause) The tempest swept athwart me;—it is past. Thomas, we're friends. Ere long we meet in England: There you shall have your fill of rights restored: There, 'mid your frowning foes, the kiss of peace, That knightly and that kingly pledge of love Which whoso violates thenceforth is base, Shall seal our meeting. Louis more than once Besought me to concede it. What remains Claim from my son. Bec. Sire, ere a king's permission Had made between a bishop and his see Plain way once more, your coasts still armed against me As citizens guard their house by night from thieves, My course was taken and announced:—return Once more to my great change. K. Hen. A festive nation Shall meet you landing there. Bec. The first, De Broc! He graces, ten long years, Saltwood, my manor, And swears that ere this throat has swallowed down Two English loaves, his knife shall wind around it! Your pardon, sire; your wandering eye denotes Your thoughts elsewhere. K. Hen. I sought a man I trust: Would I could send my Lords of Sens and Rouen To adorn your glad return! I need them both: Not less a worthy guide shall grace your way, My friend—a scholar noted—John of Oxford. Bec. I know him; and I trust him not. Whoe'er Your Highness wills is free to share my journey. I see what I foresaw, and see the end. K. Hen. Farewell, my lord: we meet ere long in England! Bec. Farewell! I think we shall not meet in England, And therefore bless you, sire, in France, and now. K. Hen. Not meet? Bec. I go to England, sire, to die. K. Hen. Am I a traitor, Thomas? Bec. (after a pause). Sire, not so. ACT V. Scene I.—Gilors. John of Oxford, and a priest. John of Oxf. This to my Lord of London. Make good haste! Ride day and night! This to my Lord of York: From every town and hamlet send the tidings That peace is made, and Becket reconciled, The Pope contented well, the realm of France Unanimous in joy. Priest. It shall be done. John of Oxf. Return at once. All letters for the king Bring straight to me: I am his secretary. The journey's costly: take my purse. Good speed! Scene II.—Wytsand, on the Coast of Boulogne. Becket, John of Salisbury, Herbert of Bosham, attendants. Bec. (standing apart from the rest). I have tried all ways beside: remains but this. (After a long pause) The night comes swiftly like a hunted man Who cloaks his sin; the sea grows black beneath it; There's not a crest that thunders on these sands But sounds some seaman's knell. The wan spume racing o'er the death-hued waters This way and that way writhes a bickering lip: As many winds as waves o'er-rush the deep, Warring like fiends whose life is hate. Alas! For him, the ship-boy on the drowning deck! He never knew the weariness of life, The sickness of the heart, the sin, the sorrow— Not thus I hoped to face my native land. What means this sinking strange? Till now my worst Was when I saw my sister in her shroud. Death, when it comes, will not be dread as this: Death is the least of that which lies before me. This is mine hour of darkness, and ill powers Usurp upon my manlier faculties, Which in the void within me faint and fail, Like stones that loosen in some high-built arch Then when the keystone crumbles— I cannot stamp my foot upon the earth: Where art thou, Power Divine, my hope till now? To what obscure and unimagined bourne Beyond the infinitudes of measureless distance Hast thou withdrawn thyself? This, this remains; Seeing no more God's glory on my path To tread it still as blindfold innocence Walks 'twixt the burning shares. John of Sal. (joining Becket). Beware, my lord! I know King Henry's eye: Go not to England. He would have you there, The man who drave you thence. Bec. Our ends are diverse; Not less my way may lie with his. John of Sal. How far? Bec. It may be to my church of Canterbury; It may be to the northern transept there; It may be to that site I honoured ever, The altar of Saint Benedict. Thus far Our paths may blend—then part. John of Sal. Go not to England! I mingled with the sailors of yon ship: Their captain signed to me: then, with both hands Laid on my shoulders, and wide, staring eyes, Thus whispered:—‘Lost! undone! Seek ye your deaths? All men may land in England—none return.’ Bec. Behold, I give you warning in good time Lest anger one day pass the bounds of truth: King Henry never schemed to shed my blood Dungeons low-vaulted, and a lifelong chain;— That was the royal dream. Return, my friend. [John of Salisbury departs. Thank God, that cloud above my spirit lightens! Danger, when near, hath still a trumpet's sound: It may be that I have not lived in vain; Let me stand once within the young king's presence, Yea though the traitors should besiege him round, Close as the birds yon rock— Arch. of Sens (arriving). My lord, God save you! Bec. One kind act more; you come to say fare-well. My brother, and my lord, four years rush back And choke my heart! We are both too old for weeping: I am a shade that fleets. May centuries bless That house so long my home! Arch. The see of Sens Has had you for her guest; our fair cathedral And yours are sisters: be the omen blest! Perhaps in future ages men may say, ‘Thomas of Canterbury, Sens' poor William— These men, so far apart in gifts of grace, Were one in mutual love.’ Bec. My lord, in heaven Not earth alone, that love shall be remembered. Bear back my homage to your good French king, That great and joyous Christian gentleman, Who keeps his youth in age. Firmly he walks The royal road—faith, hope, and charity, To throne more royal and a lordlier kingdom. Pray him to live with Henry from this hour In peace. Arch. The king will ask of your intent. Bec. Tell him we play at heads. God rules o'er all. Farewell! Arch. Good friend, and gracious lord, farewell! [The Archbishop of Sens departs, attended. Her. of Bos. (arriving). As good to go to heaven by sea as land! Sail we, my lord, this evening? Bec. Herbert, Herbert! Before thou hast trod in England forty days All that thou hast right gladly wouldst thou give To stand where now we stand. What sable shape Is that which sits on yonder rock, alone, Nor heeds the wild sea-spray? Her. My lord, Idonea; She too makes way to England, and desires Humbly your Grace's audience. Bec. Lead her hither. [Herbert departs. Herbert and John—both gone—how few are like them! They helped me on rough ways. In Herbert still, So holy and so infant-like his soul, I found a mountain-spring of Christian love Upbursting through the rock of fixed resolve, A spring of healing strength; in John, a mind That, keener than diplomatists of kings, Was crafty only 'gainst the wiles of craft, And, stored with this world's wisdom, scorned to use it Except for heavenly aims. The end draws nigh. Nor John nor Herbert sees it. [His attendants approach with Idonea. Earth's tenderest spirit and bravest! Welcome, child! Soft plant in bitter blast! Adieu, my friends; This maid hath tidings for my private ear. [The attendants depart. My message reached you then, my child, at Rouen? But what is this? Is that the countenance turned So long to yon dark West? Ido. Love reigns o'er all!— My father, who but you should hear the tale? I had forsaken that fair Norman home To seek my English convent, and those shores Denied me long. The first night of my journey There came to me a vision. All alone I roamed, methought, some forest lion-thronged And dinned all night by breakers of great seas, Booming far off. In fear I raised my head: T'ward me there moved two Forms, female in garb, In stature and in aspect more than human; The loftier wore a veil. Bec. You knew the other? Ido. The Empress! In that face, so sad of old, Was sadness more unlike that former sadness Than earthly joy could seem. Within it, lived A peace to earth unknown, and, with that peace, The hope serene of one whose heaven is sure. She placed within my hand a shining robe, And spake:—‘For him whom most thou lov'st on earth:’— It was a shroud. Bec. A shroud? Ido. And other none Than that which, 'mid the snows of Pontigny, Enswathed your sister, as in death she lay Amid the waxlight sheen. It bore that cross I traced in sanguine silk before the burial. This is, my lord, men say, your day of triumph, Christ's foes subjected and His rights restored; Doubtless long years of greatness lie before you: Perhaps for that cause she, an Empress once, Knowing that triumph is our chief of dangers, Sent you that holy warning. Bec. I accept it. Spake not that other? Ido. Suddenly a glory Forth burst that lit huge trunk and gloomiest cave: That queenlier Presence had upraised her veil. Bec. You knew her face? Ido. And learned what man shall be When risen to incorrupt. It was your sister! Bec. Great God! I guessed it. Ido. In her hand she held A crown whose radiance quenched the heavenly signs; The star-crown of the elect who bore the Cross. With act benign she placed it in my hand, And spake:—‘For him thou lov'st the most on earth.’ It was her being spake—her total being— Body and spirit, not her lips alone. I heard: I saw. That vision by degrees Ceased from before me;—long the light remained: A cloudless sun was rising, pale and dim, In that great glory lost. Bec. My daughter, tell me— Ido. This storm is nothing; nor a world in storm! The rage of nations, and the wrath of kings! God sits above the roaring water-floods: He in our petty tumults hath His peace, And we our peace in His. Man's life is good; Death better far. Bec. Was this a dream or vision? Ido. A vision and from God. The man who dreams Makes question none if dream it be or real: But when he wakes, well knows he that he dreams not: Thus knew I that I dreamed not. Bec. Dream and vision Are both God's heralds oft— Ido. To make us strong In duteous tasks, not lull the soul, or soften. That vision past, tenfold in me there burned The craving once again to tread our England, Where fiercest is the battle for the Faith. Thither this night I sail. Bec. In three days I. Ere then a perilous task must be discharged: The Pope hath passed the sentence of suspension On two schismatic bishops, London and York. See you these parchments with the leaded seals? They must be lodged within the offenders' hands— Chiefly the hands of York—and lodged moreover While witnesses are by. Llewellen failed But late with missives charged of milder sort: If this time he succeeds, and yet is captured, Send tidings in his place. Ido. Llewellen's known; Was late in England; all your friends are known. Those prelates both are now, I think, in London: On Sunday morning this poor hand of mine Shall lodge that sentence, ay, and hold it fast, Within the hand of York. Bec. The danger's great: The habit of a nun might lull suspicion: Not less, the deed accomplished— Ido. Can they find Dungeon so deep that God will not be there, And those twain memories which beside me move, My soul's defence, a mother's and a brother's? Or death? One fears to live, for life is sin: One fears not death. Your sister 'mid the snows Upon this bosom died: she feared not death; While breath remained she thanked her God, and praised Him. The Empress on this bosom died; death near, She was most humbly sad, most sweetly fearful; But, closer as it drew, her hope rose high, And all was peace at last. Bec. Then go, my child. You claim a great prize—meet it is you find it. May He who made, protect you! May His saints, Fair-flowering and full-fruited in His beam, Sustain you with their prayers; His angel host In puissance waft you to your earthly bourne, In splendour to your heavenly. Earth, I think, Hath many a destined work for that small hand;— Sigh not as yet for heaven! Ido. I will not, father: I wait His time. Bec. The wind has changed to south: The sea grows smoother, and a crimson light Shines on the sobbing sands. Beyond the cliff The sun sets red. This is the mandate, child; Farewell, and pray for me! [Idonea kneels, kisses his hand, and departs. Her. (returning with the rest). Bad rumours thicken— Bec. In three days hence I tread my native shores. Llew. With what intent? Bec. To stamp this foot of mine Upon the bosom of a waiting grave, And wake a slumbering realm. Llew. May it please your Grace— Bec. My friends, seven years of exile are enough: If into that fair church I served of old I may not entrance make, a living man, Let them who loved me o'er its threshold lift And lay my body dead. Scene III.—Sea-shore at Dover. The Archbishop of York, the Bishops of London and of Salisbury. Gil. The boors at Sandwich as his ship drew near Noting the great cross archiepiscopal, Met him breast high in the waves. Joce. of Sal. The women hailed him The orphan's father, and the widow's judge: From Sandwich to the gates of Canterbury The concourse, as he passed them, knelt, and sang ‘Blessed the man who cometh in God's name!’ Gil. De Broc and our retainers, as he landed, Drew near, their armour hidden 'neath their vests, Protesting with fierce brows against our wrong: Becket thus answered: ‘With your king's consent— Two hundred men together heard him speak it— The Pope suspends those bishops for their sin.’ If Henry yields, all's lost. Roger. The king's consent! 'Twas he who bade us crown the prince his son! Gil. The game is played, and lost. The cards were with us— A king magnanimous, and an angry queen Foe of our foe; an emperor whose sword Warred on the crosier; and an antipope; The barons with us, and the people cowed. These things were for us; what was there against us? One man—one man alone; not trained in schools; No canonist; with scant ascetic fame; A man once worldly warred on by the world: My lords, this man, subduing his own heats, And learning how to wait, hath to himself Well-nigh subdued the realm. No course remains This day, except to yield. Joce. We had these helps; But policy had none. Roger. My lord, we had one: A day ere Becket landed all was marred. I at Saint Paul's had sung that morn the mass: The king was standing with his courtiers round him; Then drew to me a nun in black, and knelt: She raised, in humble sort, a scroll. I took it. She closed my hand in both of hers, and cried, ‘A mandate from the Pope with his command To read the same aloud.’ The papal seal— The Fisherman's—witnessed that scroll authentic: Perforce I read it. 'Twas my own suspension! Joce. The nun? Roger. Through folly of the king she 'scaped: The boy but laughed; then sent her to her convent, Therein to plot and pray. Joce. Her name? Be Broc (who has just ridden up). Idonea! The accursèd veil hid not the hand! I knew it. I knew it, and remembered well that day When, as she passed me, by the primate's side Issuing from Canterbury's sanctuary, I said, ‘That small white hand shall dig his grave!’ From John of Oxford this! he landed late At Sandwich with the traitor. Roger. Sir, I thank you. (Reads) ‘The king has given consent to those suspensions, And stands impledged to fill the vacant sees. Wring, from this darkness, dawn! At once—unbidden— In over-measure crown his six years' suit. Send him six canons from each vacant see: Let these elect the bishop he shall choose, In his own chapel, yea, in his own presence; The royal heart will then be wholly yours: Make speed across the seas.’ Gil. At once—we must: I much misdoubt this youthful king. De Broc. Attend: Where'er the traitor moves I hem him round With horsemen fierce and free. Without a guard He dares not move. Now mark! A guard's an army! A larger army is that rabble-rout Which dogs his steps. Scare the young king with rumours; Wake up his spleen; tell him the primate's sworn To abase a prince ill crowned. Gil. The prince, thus warned, When Becket reaches London must repel him. His heart will sink; the people's zeal will slack, And wild tales rush abroad. De Broc. The self-same rumours Shall fire the father-king. Roger. A sager counsel— De Broc. Sage heads and keen of England, and of France That think ye see so far, I tell you this, Within the hollow heart of all your sageness A blind worm works! Farewell! Ere long you'll cry, ‘The strong hand of De Broc was worth us all.’ [He gallops away. The rest, except Gilbert of London, walk rapidly towards the harbour. Gil. (alone). Somewhere—I know not when—I know not how— I took, methinks, one step—one little step— A hair's breadth only from the righteous way. Where will this end? I know not. This I know, A man there is I hate; his name is Becket. Scene IV.—The Great Hall of the Palace of Bur, near Bayeux. In parts of the hall tables are spread; in other parts the guests converse. At the higher end stand two thrones, on one of which Queen Eleanor sits. Cornwall, Leicester, the Bishop of Lisieux, De Tracy, De Moreville, Brito, courtiers, ladies, guests, and minstrels. Q. Elea. Be merry, lords; we keep our birthday feast: Share ye the royal joy! Cours. God save the Queen! Corn. (to Leicester). Five weeks that splendour strengthened on his brow; Revolted feudatories made submission; Flanders and France were leagued with him in love: Then once again that inward grief returned; New nightmares vexed his bed. Q. Elea. Set forth a dance! Leic. (to Cornwall). Sir, the heart hardening maketh soft the brain: He is not what he was. Of old, when wrath Hurled forth its fiercest flame, his mind not less Rushed up keen-edged within it and above it A spear's length higher;—higher rose his will: To-day his angers drag aside his purpose Which oftenest finds its end in accident: He hath done his own soul wrong. Corn. Greatness goes from him. [The king enters with John of Oxford; they converse apart in a window. John of Oxf. He's hot, the goal in sight; his native airs Dissolve that frosty caution exile taught him: He said, ‘My lords of Rouen and of Sens Save for that king had brought me home in honour:’ He plots; but plots not war. Leicester, I note, Whispers: his zeal takes cold. K. Hen. What meant those letters? John of Oxf. His knave that blabbed his secret knew not that: One was for Scotland's king, and four, he thought, For princes rebel late in Wales; the rest For earls in England malcontent. K. Hen. He dares not. John of Oxf. Doubtless he dares not; and that popular zeal Which hailed him landing, was but madness old: He plays a deeper game than treason. K. Hen. Ha! John of Oxf. The realm invaded, or those earls in arms, He blows the Church's trumpet,—marches to London; Commends himself deliverer of the king; Recovers straight his pupil's childish love, Or mildly, else, inthralls him. Q. Elea. Flavel, sing! I dance no more. Lis. (to Leicester). Her Highness is not pleased: The man she hates hath triumphed. Year by year She urged his Highness 'gainst my lord the primate; Of late she whets him with more complicate craft: She knows that all she likes the king dislikes, And feigns a laughing, new-born zeal for Becket, To sting the royal wrath. K. Hen. (to John of Oxford). He never should have trod those English shores. John of Oxf. As freeman, never;—said I not as much? The young king's council should have found those letters; And dealt him traitor's doom. Please it your Highness, 'Tis not too late. My Lord Justiciary Stands by the council's side. K. Hen. I dare not, John; His death, though death by chance, would wrong my heart— Imprisonment itself requires pretext. There are that watch us: mingle with the crowd. [John of Oxford departs. Q. Elea. What does our gracious liege so long in exile? We languish in his absence, like poor vines Here in this sunless North. He plots, no doubt, With John of Oxford 'gainst our first of men, My lord the primate. Once I loathed that man:— 'Twas folly! What if he contemns all women, Man-like he fought his battle, and hath won: The man that wins should wear! I ever cry, ‘Let him win all!’ [The king approaches and sits on a chair not far from the queen's throne. Welcome, good king and husband! I praise your friend! From England forth he fled A debtor and a bankrupt. He returns A Legate, trampling down your royal bishops; I say, let him have all! K. Hen. Our queen is mirthful. Q. Elea. When Becket rose, a man was England's king: Finding such charge too onerous for such manhood He slipped his burthen, and a boy sits throned; Wears a straw crown. Becket is king in substance; Why not in name? Though secular kings—when saints— Have spurned that siren, Power, he need not fear her: Yon bird grows sleek on weeds poison to us, So doth mine earlier favourite Punchinello, And Becket, meekly wearing crowns of earth, Shall merit heaven's the more. K. Hen. Our queen goes mad! Q. Elea. My southern realm remains. That sunnier half Outweighs the whole;—and yet not thus you deemed, Husband, that time when, Stephen dead, you sued Your wife's good aid. I made you King of England! My strong Provencal fleet o'erawed that day Your English barons; barred them from allies: That hour the work was mine; the jest was yours: You thought it laughter-worth. My turn comes next! Ye that have goblets, brim them! Mark this cup: It flames with Albi's wine. [Queen Eleanor rises and stands on the highest step of the throne with a golden cup in her right hand. Leic. (to Lisieux). Behold her, Lisieux! That smile is baleful as a winter beam Streaking some coast wreck-gorged;—her hair and eyes Send forth a glare half sunshine and half lightning— Q. Elea. A health, my lords! the London merchant's son, Once England's primate—henceforth King of England! K. Hen. (leaping to his feet and half drawing his sword). Woman, be silent! Fitz-Urse (entering). May it please your Highness, My lords of York, London, and Salisbury Are come from England, charged with news not good: My lord of London, worn, and somewhat faint, Rests by the gate. K. Hen. Command them to the presence. [The Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Salisbury enter, followed by Gilbert of London, low bent and leaning on John of Oxford. Scene V.—The porch of Canterbury Cathedral. Herbert of Bosham, John of Salisbury; near them attendants, waiting the arrival of Becket. Her. Here stood we on his consecration feast: The long years dragged: to-day they seem but weeks, A dove-flight of white weeks through vernal air. John of Sal. Herbert, you jar me with your ceaseless triumphs And hope 'gainst hope. You are like a gold leaf dropped From groves immortal of the Church triumphant To mock the rough wave of our Church in storm: I pray you, chafe at times! The floods are out! I say the floods are out! This way and that They come a-sweeping. Her. Wheresoe'er they sweep The eye of God pursues them, and controls: That which they are to Him, that only are they: The rest is pictured storm. John of Sal. How sped your journey? Her. From first to last De Broc with wrong assailed us; But on us, like a passionate south wind, blew The greetings of the loyal and the just. We rode two days. London's old tower in sight, We met the citizens; for miles forth streamed they To meet their citizen—for so they hailed him. The poor came first; then merchants and their wives; Next, clad in gold, the mayor and aldermen; And, lastly, priests intoning Benedictus Scarce heard amid the pealing of the bells. On London Bridge the houses at each side That topped with their quaint gables every arch, Hung tapestries forth, their roofs o'erswarmed with gazers; The ships were purpled o'er with flags that waving Painted the crystal bosom of the Thames— More swayed by popular ecstasies, it seemed, Than shiftings of the wind. John of Sal. How looked our Thomas? Her. Passing, he gave the blessing with still smile. One time he laughed: 'twas when a crazy beldam Cried from the crowd, ‘Beware the knife, archbishop!’ Sighed once—'twas when he passed his parents' door Flower-garlanded; the gayest in Cheapside. John of Sal. Where lodged he? Her. At my Lord of Winton's palace. At eve he paced the gardens, by his side Saint Albans' abbot, Simon. I was near: I marked him draw the right hand of the abbot Within his robe;—then heard, ‘My friend, my friend, Things are not what they seem!’ John of Sal. Saw he his pupil? Her. At ten next morning Joceline of Louvaine Sent by that pupil rudely sought the primate: The boy-king bade him back to Canterbury! ‘Shall I not barely see the royal face?’ Thus answered he—no more. If ever grief Cast shadow on man's face, I saw it then. He sat till noon had struck; then bade to horse. John of Sal. Your homeward way was hardest? Her. Hardest thrice; The news had gone abroad, and many shunned us; Aggression hourly wore a fiercer front; More contumelious brows were on us bent: Here lay the bridge a ruin; shafts assailed us; The dyke was cut; the road in water drowned: We heard, one time, the spleenful horn of knaves That hunted in his Grace's woods: as yet They dared no more. The Council sought De Luci: The strong man thus made answer to their suit; ‘I am this kingdom's High Justiciary, And not your faction's hangman. Four years since I deemed the Legate wrought 'gainst England's laws, And acted on that thought. The Legate banned me: Richard de Luci ‘founded the Abbey of Lesnes in Kent, in honour of the martyr [Becket], and became a canon there after his resignation’ (Professor Stubbs's ‘Constitutional History,’ vol. i. p. 469). I deemed his censures dealt “errante clave” And put them from my mind. Now ye wrong him: I run not with your pack.’ John of Sal. Brave man and true! How few know friend from foe! Now hear my tale: Go where I might, except among the poor, 'Twas all one massed conspiracy of error, Close-woven, and labyrinthed, millions in one; Conspiracy, and yet unconscious half; For, though, far down, there worked one plastic mind, The surface seemed fortuitous concurrence, One man the hook supplying, one the eye, Here the false maxim, there the fact suborned, This the mad hope, and that the grudge forgotten. The lawyer wrote the falsehood in the dust Of mouldering scrolls; with sighs the Court-priest owned it; The minstrel tossed it gaily from his strings; The witling lisped it, and the soldier mouthed it. These lies are thick as dust in March— Her. Which galls us, Yet clothes the expectant harvest fields with gold. John of Sal. I tell you, Herbert, that the coasts are guarded: The forts of Rochester and Bletchinglee Frown, soldier-crammed: the castles near the shore Bristle with arms. Spies walk among the people: De Broc spurs madly o'er the flat sea-sands, Wine-flushed, or wan with watching; I saw him fling A mailèd hand far back, and cry, ‘So long As honest steel can carve a wholesome dish No priest shall bid me starve.’ (After a pause)Herbert! see truth! One hope alone remains. My Lord of Winton Though sick, arrives ere sunset, litter-borne: That kingly countenance would o'er-awe the fiercest Without his pastoral staff and fifty knights. Ha! mark yon dust? We are saved! Her. That dust, good John, Is more illusive than my dreams and visions So oft your sport. Our hope is otherwhere. The primate bade that old man house at home A white head, England's pride. Hark, hark, a hymn! Saint Stephen's feast comes soon. The good choir-master Rehearses some sweet anthem in his praise. There's not a saint in heaven dearer to Thomas! THE HYMN. Princes sat, and spake against me; Sinners held me in their net: Thou, O Lord, wilt save Thy servant For on Thee his heart is set. Strong is he whose strength Thou art: Plain his speech, and strong his heart. A man in a mask (coming up rapidly). A troop of horse makes way through the south gate: Richard de Humet sent them—he who left The king at Bayeux late. THE HYMN. Gathered on a thousand foreheads Dark and darker grew the frown, Broadening like the pine-wood's shadow While the wintry sun goes down; On the saint that darkness fell— At last they spake; it was his knell. As a maid her face uplifteth, Brightening with an inward light, When the voice of her beloved Calls her from a neighbouring height, Stephen raised his face on high, And saw his Saviour in the sky. A man (disguised as a cripple, detaching himself from the crowd and joining them). Flee while ye may!—the primate helped me once: Unless he 'scape to-night, he sees not Tuesday. [Rejoins the revellers. THE HYMN. Dimmed a moment was that vision; O'er him burst the stony shower: Stephen with his arms extended For his murderers prayed that hour: To his prayer Saint Paul was given; The martyr slept: he woke in heaven. [Becket approaches at the head of a procession. Her. Lo, the procession comes! John of Sal. The primate walks As one that died, and rose, and dies no more. Her. I note in him one strength the world detects not: The Church for others hath seven sacraments; For him she keeps an eighth—the poor of Christ! Lo there! As often as he gives them alms He lay on them his hands. John of Sal. As one that loves them? Her. As one that, touching them, draws strength from God; Wins more than he bestows. He stops; he stands;— The exile gazes on his church again: He kneels with arms outstretched, like holy Andrew When venerating from afar his cross! [As Becket enters the cathedral Herbert goes up to him. Now die if thus God wills! I never spake That word before. In thee Christ's Church hath conquered. Now die whene'er God wills. We die together. [Becket looks at him fixedly, and passes on. Scene VI.—A Street in Canterbury. Citizens. 1st Cit. We are trapped and fooled. Death to the plotters! Haste! 2nd Cit. And which be they? 1st Cit. Who knows? 3rd Cit. A saint is Thomas! None questions that our primate is a saint; We'd fight for him and gladly, were he sound: But sanctity, some think, hath crazed his brain;— He comes not forth, as once. 4th Cit. A knight from London Saw all, and wept to tell it. Nine long hours The primate, girt with French and Flemish hordes, Besieged the young king's gates. Richard de Luci Past hope arriving, quenched the flames just lit: The rebels fled by night. 2nd Cit. The father-king Will rage at this. 4th Cit. He'll rage that two months since, When Thomas wept before the royal feet, He suffered his return. Good John of Oxford Pledged faith that hour for Canterbury's sons, Whom as his own he loves. 1st Cit. Who told you that? 4th Cit. The same old knight, kinsman of John of Oxford; And John, he said, saw all. An old Knight (riding up). God save you, sirs! Conspirators are ye fat and well-liking! Which lies the loudest? Several Cits. Nay, sir, true men we. Old Knight. Sirs, ye are Saxons; Saxons speak no truth; Else, wherefore hid they long like thieves in caverns To keep their treasons warm? What beast are you That with your foul hand stain my horse's neck Which shone like glass?—Let none deceive you, friends! They'll leave you later to the royal wrath Which, roused by wrong, burned late three towns in Maine. Beware of full-fed priests and haughty bishops! The Conqueror sent you bishops staid and sage, Most part from Normandy. They spake not English; So vexed you not with sermons. What, my friends, A man may go to heaven, yet hear not sermons! That chime's my dinner bell! God save you, sirs, And purge your primate's pride! A saint I deem him; No doubt there's healing latent in his bones; De Broc hath sworn to boil the proud flesh off them To make the relics sooner serviceable. Be wary, sirs; the knife is at your throat! [Rides away. Scene VII.—A room in the Archiepiscopal Palace at Canterbury. The Prior of Merton, Llewellen. Llew. Three bishops had arrived the day before me At Bayeux while the king and queen held feast: They instanced with such art the primate's rage, Compassionated so well the kingdom's wrongs, Some drew their swords; the king looked round and cried, ‘Your counsel, lords?’ They answered, ‘We are priests: Your captains and your peers shall best advise you.’ Leicester spake first;—'twas parable, not counsel. Malvoisin next—a babbler. Bohun thus: ‘I know not what can deal with knaves revolted But wicker-rope or sword.’ Then with dropped eyes, Gilbert of London, rising, both his hands Clasped on his breast, spake softly thus: ‘My lords, Behoves us in this crisis to be meek Lest we too much inflame the primate's zeal, Who, like a king, an army at his back, In vengeance sweeps from shore to shore of England To abase a king ill-crowned.’ Prior. What answered Henry? Llew. There fell on him that frenzy of his race Which threats the world with doom. I know not all— The men that saw it saw as in a trance And what they saw divulge not save in part. The fire-cloud of that wrath burned out at last: The Ill Spirits left him. On the rush-strewn floor There sat he glaring maniac-like, the straws Now kneading and now gnawing. That too passed: The king was standing in their midst: his eye Slowly he turned from each to each; then spake With pointed finger, and with serpent hiss: ‘Slaves, slaves, not barons hath my kingdom bred, Slaves that in silence stand, and eye their king Mocked by a low-born knave!’ Prior. None answered? Ha! Llew. No man. From that mute hall four knights forth strode— Fitz-Urse, De Tracy, Moreville, Richard Brito. At twelve last night they entered Saltwood gates: De Broc attended them. Prior. The end draws nigh. Scene VIII.—A room in the Archiepiscopal Palace at Canterbury. John of Salisbury, Herbert of Bosham. Her. At Pontigny—the day before he left it— Within the chapel of the protomartyr, His mass, the earliest in that church, just said, He knelt in prayer. The words were:—‘Thomas, Thomas!’ ‘Who art Thou, Lord?’ he answered. Then the voice, ‘Thomas, I am thy Brother, and thy Lord: My Church shall in thy blood be glorified, And thou in Me.’ John of Sal. That voice was but his thought! Her. The abbot then of Pontigny, just chosen Lyon's archbishop, came to say farewell: He stood behind a pillar and heard all. From him I learned it. Thomas kept it secret. Thank God! What comes to him shall come to us:— There's naught to fear. John of Sal. Herbert, I love my friend; But 'twas his triumph, not his death, I looked for: For him I scarce should fear to die; and yet I love not death. Ere comes that hour, there's much To learn, to read, to do, and to repent. —The solid earth shivers as ship in storm: The ground is earthquake-shaken: shadows vast Far flung, and whence we know not, o'er it sweep: Fiercely the lightnings glare— Her. Meantime God's Church Nor hastes, nor halts, nor frets, nor is amazed. John of Sal. What doth she then? Her. A smile upon her lips, She stands with eyes close fixed upon her Lord, Nay, on His sacred vestment's lowest hem, To see where next He moves. John of Sal. Herbert, I wronged you: A mystic, feeding on faith's inmost lore— A dreamer, scanning mysteries in flowers— I guessed not of your strength. Scene IX.—Archiepiscopal Palace at Canterbury. Edward Grim, Llewellen, monks. 1st Monk. Saint Stephen's festival! Another Christmas! Easter's our sunrise; Pentecost is noon: But Christmas is the aurora, pure and white; God's feast it is of innocence and snow, The Maid and Babe, angels and simple shepherds; 'Tis Mary's week in winter, sweet as May:— Llew. What stranger's yon? 2nd Monk. They call him Edward Grim; Poor scholar late at Cambridge: long he yearned To see the primate. Llew. Ill he timed his visit: None wants him here. Grim (in a low voice to a monk). Proceed, my friend, I pray you. 3rd Monk (to Grim). On Christmas night he sang the midnight mass— Our Benedictine rite. At noon he preached, ‘Peace upon earth,’ his text. ‘We have not here Abiding city, but we look for one;’ Thus he began: ‘Is this at war with peace? Nay, this alone is peace: bereft of all things, Then most our God is ours; and God is peace.’ Next spake he of the saints of Canterbury: ‘Ye have a Martyr likewise, Saint Elphege, And God may give you, friends, ere long another.’ On all sides sobs burst forth, and wail was heard, ‘Father, desert us not;’—one little moment With them he wept; and then in strength resumed: Like some great anthem was that sermon's close, The whole church glowing with seraphic joy. 4th Monk. The man is changed. 3rd Monk. Seldom he speaks; his smile Is like that smile upon a dead man's face, A mystery of sweetness. Llew. Lo, he comes! Bec. (entering with Herbert). Herbert, my friend beloved, depart this night; Consign these letters to the good French king: And you, my chaplain, Richard, speed to Norwich; In my name bid its bishop to absolve All who in ignorance erred. Her. No power shall move me! My lord, once only pardon disobedience! We two have shared great dangers: let us share, If so God wills, the last! Bec. I have had from you, Herbert, great love! I claim this hour a greater: Shake not my heart with any earthly passion: More late we say farewell. Bertram, next morn Seek out that aged priest we met at Wortham, That kind old man who serves another's charge: This deed confers upon him Penshurst's church; Let it be his ere noon. My brave Llewellen, To Rome, and bear these letters to the Pope! That bitter word you spake at Clarendon To him one moment Satan's blinded thrall, Saved him when all but lost. Except for you I had up-towered this day in Europe's face Robed in the total greatness of my country— Within, a soul undone! At dawn we keep The feast of him who, sole of the apostles, Died not for Christ. Perchance he loved Him most! Perchance, so great a thing is love, that death, The martyr's death, could add not to its greatness. The Church boasts next her Holy Innocents, Martyrs through grace, though not their own intention: What saint makes beautiful the third day hence? A Monk. It lacks as yet its crown. Bec. We give it then To Saint Elphege, martyr of Canterbury Then when the Dane devastated the land: His anthem I must hear once more. Farewell! [He moves away, but stops for a moment before a window. How fair, how still, that snowy world! The earth Lies like a white rose under eyes of God— May it send up a sweetness! Scene X.—Canterbury Cathedral—the north transept. John of Salisbury and a monk. Monk. Within his chamber we had sung our nocturns: The office finished, for an hour or more He stood beside the casement open flung Despite the flying flakes. I heard him murmur, ‘They deck one day with gems the martyr's shrine— Tears, tears fall seldom on a churchman's grave: Is that a loss? Ah me!’ Again I heard him: ‘Herbert, my tenderest friend, and John, my wisest, Both, both for me have lost their earthly all: These must live on, bereft.’ More late he asked If Sandwich might be reached ere break of day: We answered, ‘Yea—two hours ere dawn.’ Once more He stood forth-gazing through the winter night; Then spake aloud, ‘Whate'er God hath in store, Thomas will wait it patient in his church: He leaves that church no more.’ John of Sal. The last chance lost! Monk. At yonder altar of Saint Benedict He said his mass; then in the chapter-house Conversed with two old monks of things divine: Next for his confessor he sent, and made Confession with his humble wont, but briefly; Last, sat with us an hour, and held discourse Full gladsomely. I never marked till then How joyous was his eye. An old monk cried, ‘Thank God, my lord, you make good cheer!’ He answered, ‘Who goeth to his Master should be glad.’ John of Sal. His Master! Ay, his Master! Still as such He thought of God; he loved Him;—in himself Saw nothing great or wise—simply a servant. Ere yet his earliest troubles had begun I heard him say, ‘A bishop should protect That holy thing, God's Church, to him committed, Not only from the world but from himself, Loving, not hers, but her, with reverent love, A servant's love that, gazing, fears to touch her: As Mary in the guardian Patriarch's house Such should she be in his.’ Monk. We little knew him! We chose him; but with scanty love or trust. John of Sal. He hated rapine; warred on sacrilege— Trod down abuses; then an outcast lived, Outcast and exile. Had he reigned ten years His name had been for aye ‘the Great Reformer.’ —Peace, peace! O God, we make our tale of him As men that praise the dead! Monk. We who have stalls are summoned. Lo, they come. [The monks of St. Augustine's enter the Cathedral; they advance to the chapel of the Chapter, joined by John of Salisbury and all the other Benedictines, and immediately begin vespers. During the singing of the psalms, a cry bursts out in the streets, accompanied by a rush of soldiers against the southern gates. The monks continue the sacred rite. A few minutes later a procession enters from the cloister, Becket walking last, preceded by his cross-bearer. Having reached a spot in the north transept, midway between the altar of the Blessed Virgin and that of St. Benedict, he stands still. Bec. Those who are monks must take their place at vespers: Make haste, and join the Chapter. Ye are late. [His attendants obey him; none remaining with Becket except the Prior of Merton, Fitz-Stephen, and Edward Grim. A few monks stand close within the western gates of the Cathedral. A rush of feet is heard outside, and cries of ‘Open the gates—save us!’ Monk. Keep barred the gates—the soldiers once among us— Fitz-Ste. (coming up). The primate bids you fling the portals wide: He says a church must not be made a castle: ‘Let all my people in.’ [Fitz-Stephen returns. The gates are opened; a terrified crowd rushes in; solidiers pursue them; but on entering the Cathedral are overawed and kneel. Vespers proceed. THE ANTHEM. Behold a great High Priest with rays Of martyrdom's red sunset crowned; None other like him in the days Wherein he trod the earth was found. The swords of men unholy met Above that just one and he bled: But God, the God he served, hath set A wreath unfading on his head. Bec. A martyr's anthem! Fitz-Ste. Yea; our great Elphege. Bec. Thank God! I wished to hear his praise once more. Prior. The church grows dark as night. Fitz-Ste. A deed more dark— [The soldiers rise from their knees and stand round the gates. Prior. My lord archbishop, seek the sanctuary! Bec. My place is here;—farewell, my friends! Prior. In the cloister I hear an armed tread: a postern's there; Not many know it. Who be those four knights, In sable mailed and fiercely onward striding With vizors down? [Fitz-Urse, De Tracy, Brito, and De Moreville enter. Fitz-Ste. I know their guide—him only: De Broc it is—De Broc! Bec. Seek out, my friends, That chapel where they sing—ye cannot see it— Their rite completed, bid them chaunt Te Deum. [The Prior and Fitz-Stephen depart; the poor scholar, Edward Grim, alone remains with Becket. The four knights arrive, but at first do not see the primate, who is screened by a pillar. Fitz-Urse. Where is the traitor? Bec. (advancing, and standing opposite the altar of St. Benedict). Here I stand; no traitor, But priest of God, and primate of this land. Fitz-Urse (after looking at him long). God help thee, priest! At once absolve those bishops! Bec. The Church of God suspends them for their sin; The king approved that sentence; thrice approved: Two hundred heard him: you were of their number. Fitz-Urse. Never. Bec. I saw you, and God saw you there. Fitz-Urse. Remove those censures. Bec. You have had your answer. Reginald, Reginald! Alas! light man, That giv'st thine all for naught! If yet thou canst, Repent and live! Fitz-Urse. He threatens—lo, he threatens! Our lives he threatens, and reviles the king! He'll place the realm beneath an interdict;— Traitor! thine hour is come! [He draws his sword, the rest close around Becket. Bec. Ye that would slay the shepherd, spare the sheep! If not, I bind you with the Church's sentence: That which ye do, do here. Fitz-Urse. In death itself This man must dominate! Strike him down and slay him! Bec. (crossing his hands over his breast, and bending forward). My spirit I commend to God Most High, The prayers of Mary mother of my Lord, And those two martyrs of the Church of God, Saints Denys and Elphege. [William de Tracy draws his sword, and aims a blow at Becket. Edward Grim intercepts it with his arm, which is nearly severed. The sword descends, notwithstanding, on the head of Becket. Bec. I yield Thee thanks, my Maker and my God! Receive my soul. [He falls forward on his knees. The second blow is struck by Fitz-Urse, and the third by Brito. Bec. For the great name of Jesus, and that Church Cleansed by His saving blood, with joy I die. [He falls forward on his face and dies. De More. O black and dreadful day! Earth reels beneath us! Fitz-Urse. The traitor's dead! He'll rise no more: rush forth! And ever make your cry, ‘King's men are we!’ [They rush forth waving their swords and shouting ‘King's men!’ MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. To the Memory OF JOHN KEATS. ODE TO THE DAFFODIL. 1. O love-star of the unbelovèd March, When, cold and shrill, Forth flows beneath a low, dim-lighted arch The wind that beats sharp crag and barren hill, And keeps unfilmed the lately torpid rill! 2. A week or e'er Thou com'st thy soul is round us everywhere; And many an auspice, many an omen, Whispers, scarce noted, thou art coming. Huge, cloudlike trees grow dense with sprays and buds, And cast a shapelier gloom o'er freshening grass, And through the fringe of ragged woods More shrouded sunbeams pass. Fresh shoots conceal the pollard's spike The driving rack out-braving; The hedge swells large by ditch and dike; And all the uncoloured world is like A shadow-limned engraving. 3. Herald and harbinger! with thee Begins the year's great jubilee! Of her solemnities sublime A sacristan whose gusty taper Flashes through earliest morning vapour, Thou ring'st dark nocturns and dim prime. Birds that have yet no heart for song Gain strength with thee to twitter; And, warm at last, where hollies throng, The mirrored sunbeams glitter. With silk the osier plumes her tendrils thin: Sweet blasts, though keen as sweet, the blue lake wrinkle; And buds on leafless boughs begin Against grey skies to twinkle. 4. To thee belongs A pathos drowned in later scents and songs! Thou com'st when first the Spring On Winter's verge encroaches; When gifts that speed on wounded wing Meet little save reproaches! Thou com'st when blossoms blighted, Retracted sweets, and ditty, From suppliants oft deceived and spited More anger draw than pity! Thee the old shepherd, on the bleak hill-side, Far distant eyeing leans upon his staff Till from his cheek the wind-brushed tear is dried: In thee he spells his boyhood's epitaph. To thee belongs the youngling of the flock, When first it lies, close-huddled from the cold, Between the sheltering rock And gorse-bush slowly overcrept with gold. 5. Thou laugh'st, bold outcast bright as brave, When the wood bellows, and the cave, And leagues inland is heard the wave! Hating the dainty and the fine As sings the blackbird thou dost shine! Thou com'st while yet on mountain lawns high up Lurks the last snow; while by the berried breer As yet the black spring in its craggy cup No music makes or charms no listening ear: Thou com'st while from the oak stock or red beech Dead Autumn scoffs young Spring with splenetic speech; While in her vidual chastity the Year With frozen memories of the sacred past Her doors and heart makes fast, And loves no flower save those that deck the bier: Ere yet the blossomed sycamore With golden surf is curdled o'er; Ere yet the birch against the blue Her silken tissue weaves anew: Thou com'st while, meteor-like 'mid fens, the weed Swims, wan in light; while sleet-showers whitening glare; Weeks ere by river brims, new furred, the reed Leans its green javelin level in the air. 6. Child of the strong and strenuous East! Now scattered wide o'er dusk hill bases Now massed in broad, illuminate spaces; Torchbearer at a wedding feast Whereof thou mayst not be partaker, But mime, at most, and merrymaker; Phosphor of an ungrateful sun That rises but to bid thy lamp begone:— Farewell! I saw Writ large on woods and lawns to-day that Law Which back remands thy race and thee To hero-haunted shades of dark Persephonè. To-day the Spring has pledged her marriage vow: Her voice, late tremulous, strong has grown and steady: To-day the Spring is crowned a queen: but thou Thy winter hast already! Take my song's blessing, and depart, Type of true service—unrequited heart. Curragh Chase, 1861. A FAREWELL. I Round me thy great woods sigh In their full-foliaged glory; but I die: Ah, blame me not; although Tired and o'er-spent, I never prayed to go. In thine old towers I leave A cradled pledge to take his mother's part; To vex thee not, nor grieve, Yet lay, at times, my hand about thy heart. II Nearer—this dying past— Bend nearer down that noble head at last; Lower and yet more low Till o'er my brow a tear has leave to flow. Then the brief seizure quell; And say that all is over; all is well: Say I lived—and died— For this, and am in silence satisfied. SONG. Love laid down his golden head On his mother's knee; ‘The world runs round so fast,’ he said, ‘None has time for me.’ Thought, a sage unhonoured, turned From the on-rushing crew; Song her starry legend spurned; Art her glass down threw. Roll on, blind world, upon thy track Until thy wheels catch fire! For that is gone which comes not back To seller nor to buyer! A PICTURE OF HERODIAS' DAUGHTER BY LUINI. Alas, Salomè! couldst thou know How great man is—how great thou art— What destined worlds of weal or woe Lurk in the shallowest human heart, From thee thy vanities would drop Like sins in noble anger spurned By one who finds, beyond all hope, The passion of his youth returned. Ah, sunbright face whose brittle smile Is cold as sunbeams flashed on ice! Ah, lips how sweet yet hard the while! Ah, soul too barren even for vice! Vanity's glittering mask! Those eyes No beam the less around them shed Albeit in that red scarf there lies The dancer's meed—the prophet's head. VANITY. I False and fair! Beware, beware! There is a tale that stabs at thee! The Arab seer, he stripped thee bare, He told thy secret, Vanity! By day a mincing foot is thine; Thou runn'st along the spider's line: Ay! but heavy sounds thy tread By night, among the uncoffined dead! II Fair and foul! Thy mate, the ghoul, Beats, bat-like, on thy latticed gate; Around the graves the night-winds howl; ‘Arise,’ they cry, ‘thy feast doth wait!’ Dainty fingers thine, and nice, With thy bodkin picking rice! Ay: but when the night's o'erhead. Limb from limb they rend the dead! CHAUCER. Escaped from the city, its smoke, its glare, 'Tis pleasant, showers over, and birds in chorus, To sit in green alleys and breathe cool air Which the violet only has breathed before us! Such healthful solace is ours, forsaking The glass-growth of modern and modish rhyme For the music of days when the Muse was breaking On Chaucer's pleasance like dawn's sweet prime. Hands rubbed together smell still of earth: The hot-bed verse has a hot-bed taint; 'Tis sense turned sour, its cynical mirth: 'Tis pride, its darkness: its blush, 'tis paint! His song was a feast where thought and jest Like monk and franklin alike found place, Good Will's Round Table! There sat as guest Shakespearian insight with Spenser's grace. His England lay laughing in Faith's bright morn! Life in his eye looked as rosy and round As the cheek of the huntsman that blows on the horn When the stag leaps up, and loud bays the hound. King Edward's tourney, fair Blanche's court, Their clarions, their lutes in his verse live on: But he loved better the birds' consort Under oaks of Woodstock while rose the sun. The cloister, the war-field tented and brave, The shout of the burghers in hostel or hall, The embassy grave over ocean's wave, And Petrarch's converse—he loved them all. In Spring, when the breast of the lime-grove gathers Its roseate cloud; when the flushed streams sing, And the mavis tricks her in gayer feathers; Read Chaucer then; for Chaucer is Spring! On lonely evenings in dull Novembers When rills run choked under skies of lead, And on forest-hearths the year's last embers Wind-heaped and glowing, lie, yellow and red. Read Chaucer still! In his ivied beaker With knights, and wood-gods, and saints embossed Spring hides her head till the wintry breaker Thunders no more on the far-off coast. SPENSER. One peaceful spot in a storm-vexed isle Shall wear for ever the past's calm smile; Kilcolman Castle! There Spenser sate; There sang, unweeting of coming fate. That song he sang was a life-romance Woven by Virtues in mystic dance Where the gods and heroes of Grecian story Themselves were Virtues in allegory. True love was in it, but love sublimed, Occult, high-reason'd, bewitch'd, be-rhymed! The knight was the servant of ends trans-human, The women were seraphs, the bard half woman. Time and its tumults, stern shocks, hearts wrung, To him were mad words to sweet music sung, History to him an old breviary quaint Bordered round with gold Angel and sworded Saint. Creative indeed was that eye, sad Mary! That hailed in thy rival a queen of faery, And in Raleigh, half statesman, half pirate, could see But the shepherd of ocean's green Arcady. Under groves of Penshurst his first notes rang: As Sidney lived so his Spenser sang: From the well-head of Chaucer one stream found birth, Like an Arethusa, on Irish earth. From the court he had fled, and the courtly lure: One virgin muse in an age not pure Wore Florimel's girdle, and mourned in song (He guessed not its import) Ierne's wrong. Roll onward, thou western Ilyssus, roll, ‘Mulla,’ far kenned by ‘old mountain Mole!’ With thy Shepherds a Calidore loved to dwell; And beside him an Irish Pastorel. Where are they, those garlands she flung on thy tide, Bending over thee, giftless—that well-sung bride? ‘Song made in lieu of many ornaments.’ Spenser's Epithalamium on his own Marriage. The flowers have passed by, but abideth the river;— May thy Genius, its Guardian, be near it for ever! ODE, WRITTEN BESIDE THE LAGO VARESE. (SEE SIR HENRY TAYLOR'S POEM, ENTITLED ‘LAGO VARESE.’) Still rise around that lake well sung New growths as boon and good As when, by sunshine saddened, long Beside its margin stood That northern youth, and o'er it breathed a lay Which praised things beauteous, mourning their decay. As then, great Nature, ‘kind to sloth,’ Lets drop o'er all the land Her gifts, the fair and fruitful both, Into the sleeper's hand: On golden ground once more she paints as then Starred cistus bower, and convent-brightened glen. Still o'er the flashing waters lean The mulberry and the maize, And roof of vines whose purple screen Tempers those piercing rays, Which here forego their fiercer shafts, and sleep, Subdued, in crimson cells, and verdurous chambers deep. And still in many a sandy creek Light waves run on and up, While the foam-bubbles winking break Around the channelled cup: Against the rock they toss the bleeding gourd, Or fret on marble stair and skiff unmoored. Fulfilled thus far the Poet's words: And yet a truth, that hour By him unsung, upon his chords Descends, their ampler dower. He sang of Nature's cyclic life, nor knew That frailer shape he mourned should bloom perpetual too. There still—not skilful to retract A glance as kind as keen— By the same southern sunset backed There still that Maid is seen: Through song's high grace there stands she! from her eyes Still beam the cordial mirth, the unshamed surprise! Not yet those parted lips remit A smile that grows and grows: The Titianic morning yet Breaks from that cheek of rose: Still from her locks the breeze its sweetness takes: Around her white feet still the ripple fawns and rakes. And, bright'ning in the radiance cast By her on all around, That shore lives on, while song may last, Love-consecrated ground; Lives like that isthmus, headland half, half isle, Which smiled to meet Catullus' homeward smile. O Sirmio! thou that shedd'st thy fame O'er old Verona's lake, Henceforth Varese without blame Thine honours shall partake: A Muse hath sung her, on whose front with awe Thy nymphs had gazed as though great Virtue's self they saw! What Shape is that, though fair severe, Which fleets triumphant by Imaged in yonder mirror clear, And seeks a hardier sky, With locks succinct beneath a threat'ning crest— Like Juno in the brow, like Pallas in the breast? A Muse that flatters nothing base In man, nor aught infirm, ‘Sows the slow olive for a race Unborn.’ The destined germ, The germ alone of Fame she plants, nor cares What time that secular tree its deathless fruitage bears; Pleased rather with her function sage— To interpret Nature's heart; The words on Wisdom's sacred page To wing through metric art With life; and in a chariot of sweet sound Down-trodden Truth to lift, and waft, the world around. Hail, Muse, whose crown, soon won or late, Is Virtue's, not thine own! Hail, Verse, that tak'st thy strength and state From Thought's auguster throne! Varese too would hail thee! Hark that song— Her almond bowers it thrills and rings her groves along! October 4, 1856. ODE. THE GOLDEN MEAN. Fortune! unloved of whom are those On whom the Virtues smile, Forbear the land I love, and choose, Choose still some meaner isle! Thy best of gifts are gilded chains; The gold wears off; the bond remains. Thus much of good, nor more, is thine, That, clustering round the wand Thou lift'st, with honey smeared and wine, In that unqueenly hand, Close-limed are trapped those sun-bred flies Which else had swarmed about the wise. The vanities of fleeting time To powers that fleet belong; They fear and hate the sons sublime Of science and of song, And those that, scorned as weak, o'errule The strong, and keep the world at school. For how could Song her tenderer notes Elaborate for the ear Of one on vulgar noise who doats; Of one through deserts drear On-rushing in that race distraught Whose goad is hate, whose goal is naught? And how could Science trust that line, Her labyrinth's sacred clue, Of subtly-woven thought, more fine Than threads of morning dew, To those unhallowed hands and coarse The drudges base of greed or force? Faith to the sensual and the proud Whom this world makes her prey But glimmers with the light allowed To tapers at noonday; When garish joys have ta'en their flight Like stars she glorifies the night. Nor less the Heroic Life extracts From circumstance adverse Her food of sufferings and of acts; While pain, a rugged nurse, On the rough breasts of wintry seas Rocks it 'mid stormy lullabies. Hail, Poor Estate! Through thee man's race Partake, by rule controlled, The praise of them discalced who pace, And them that kneel white-stoled; Where thou hast honours due, hard by Obedience stands and Chastity. Hail, too, O Bard, nor poor nor rich, Whom one blue gleam of sea Binds to our British Cuma's beach; Our gold we store in thee; To thee not wealth but worlds belong, Like Delos raised; such might hath song! Through thee to him who climbs that down Arched onward toward the west, White cliff, green shore, and stubble brown In Idyl grace are dressed; Beside low doors, a later Ruth, Thy Dora sits—serene as truth. Thy song can girdle hill and mead With choirs, more pure, more fair, Their locks with wild flower dressed and weed, Than ever Hellas bare: Theocritus, we cry, once more Treads his beloved Trinacrian shore! O long with freedom's gale refreshed, With mild sea-murmurs lulled, O long by thee, in cares unmeshed, Those healthier flowers be culled Rich Egypt knew not, nor the wain That creaked o'er deep Bœotian plain! They lit Arcadian peaks: they breathed— Light soils have airs divine— O'er Scio's rocks with ivy wreathed, Stern Parnes' brow, and thine, Pentelicus, whose marble womb With temples crowned all-conquering Rome. Teach us in all that round us lies To see and feel each hour, More than Homeric majesties, And more than Phidian power: Teach us the coasts of modern life With lordlier tasks are daily rife Than theirs who plunged the heroic oar Of old by Chersonese: But bid our Argo launch from shore Unbribed by golden Fleece: Bid us Dædalean arts to scorn Which prostituted ends suborn! That science—slave of sense—which claims No commerce with the sky, Is baser thrice than that which aims With waxen wing to fly! To grovel, or self-doomed to soar— Mechanic age, be proud no more! Lugano, October 7, 1856. LINES COMPOSED NEAR SHELLEY'S HOUSE AT LERICI, ON ALL SOULS' DAY, 1856. DEDICATED TO J. W. FIELD, IN MEMORY OF A DAY PASSED WITH HIM AT LERICI. I And here he paced! These glimmering pathways strewn With faded leaves his light swift footstep crushed; The odour of yon pine was o'er him blown: Music went by him in each wind that brushed Those yielding stems of ilex! Here, alone, He walked at noon, or silent stood and hushed When the ground-ivy flashed the moonlight sheen Back from the forest carpet always green. II Poised as on air the lithe elastic bower Now bends, resilient now against the wind Springs up, like Dryads that one moment cower And rise the next with loose locks unconfined: Through the dim roof like gems the sunbeams shower; Old cypress trunks the aspiring bay-trees bind, And soon will have them wholly underneath, Types eminent of glory conquering death. III Far down on weedy shelves and sands below The respirations of a southern sea Beat with susurrent cadence soft and slow: Round the grey cave's fantastic imagery, In undulation eddying to and fro, The purple waves on roll or backward flee; While, dewed at each rebound with gentlest shock, The myrtle leans her green breast on the rock. IV And here he stood! upon his face that light Streamed from some furthest realm of luminous thought, Which clothed his fragile beauty with the might Of suns for ever rising! Here he caught Visions divine. He saw in fiery flight ‘The hound of Heaven,’ with heavenly vengeance fraught, ‘Run down the slanted sunlight of the morn’— ‘Prometheus Unbound.’ Prometheus frown on Jove with scorn for scorn. V He saw white Arethusa, leap on leap, Plunge from the Acroceraunian ledges bare With all her torrent streams, while from the steep Alpheus bounded on her unaware: Hellas he saw, a giant fresh from sleep, Break from the night of bondage and despair. Who but had cried, as there he stood and smiled, ‘Justice and Truth have found their wingèd child!’ ‘Revolt of Islam.’ VI Through cloud and wave and star his insight keen Shone clear, and traced a God in each disguise, Protean, boundless. Like the buskined scene All Nature rapt him into ecstasies: In him, alas! had Reverence equal been With Admiration, those resplendent eyes Had wandered not through all her range sublime To miss the one great marvel of all time. VII The winds sang loud; from this Elysian nest He rose, and trod yon spine of mountains bleak, While stormy suns descending in the west Stained as with blood yon promontory's beak: That hour, responsive to his soul's unrest, Carrara's marble summits, peak to peak, Sent forth their thunders like the battle-cry Of nations arming for the victory. VIII Visions that hour more fair, more false, he saw Than those the mythologic heaven that throng; Mankind he saw exempt from Faith and Law, Move godlike forth, with science winged and song; He saw the Peoples spurn religious awe, Yet tower aloft through inbred virtue strong. Ah, Circe! not for sensualists alone Thy cup! It dips full oft in Helicon! IX Mankind he saw one equal brotherhood, All things in common held as light and air! ‘Vinum dæmonum!’ Just, and wise, and good— Were man all this, such freedom man might bear! The slave creates the tyrant! In man's blood Sin lurks, a panther couchant in his lair: Nature's confession came before the Creed's; Authority is still man's first of needs. X All things in common; equal all; all free! Not fancies these, but gifts reserved in trust: A spiritual growth is Liberty; Nature, unnatural made through hate and lust, Yields it no more, or chokes her progeny With weeds of foul desire or fell disgust. Convents have all things common: but on Grace They rest. Inverted systems lack a base. XI The more obedience to a law divine Tempers the chaos of man's heart, the less Becomes his need of outward discipline The balance of injustice to redress: ‘Wild Bacchanals of Truth's mysterious wine’ Shelley's ‘Ode to Liberty.’ Must bear the Mænad's waking bitterness. Anticipate not heaven. Not great thy worth Heaven without holiness, and heaven on earth! XII Alas! the errors thus to truth so near That sovereign truths they are, though misapplied, Errors to pure but passionate natures dear, Errors by aspirations glorified, Errors with radiance crown'd like Lucifer Ere fall'n, like him to darkness changed through pride, These of all errors are the heart and head: The strength of life is theirs; yet they are dead! XIII That Truth Revealed, by thee in madness spurned, Plato, thy master in the walks of light, Had knelt to worship! For its day he yearned Through the long hungry watches of the night: Its dawn in Thought's assumptions he discerned Silvering hoar Contemplation's star-loved height; The God-Man came! Thy pagan phantasy, Feigning a Man-God, stormed against His sky! XIV Sorrowing for thee, with sorrow joy is mixed, With triumph shame! Our hopes themselves are sad; But fitful lustres break the shades betwixt; So gleams yon olive bower, in mourning clad, And yet at times with showery gleams transfixed, That opal among trees which, grave or glad, Its furtive splendour, half revealed or wholly, Shoots ever from a base of melancholy. XV Our warfare is in darkness. Friend for foe Blindly, and oft with swords exchanged, we strike: Opinion guesses: Faith alone can know Where actual and illusive still are like: Thine was that strength which fever can bestow; The madness thine of one that, fever-sick, ‘Beats a sad mother in distempered sleep!’ From ‘Prometheus Unbound.’ Perhaps death woke thee, on her breast to weep! XVI Thee from that Mother sins ancestral tore! No heart hadst thou, from Faith's sole guide remote, With statutable worship to adore, Or learn a nation-licensed Creed by rote; No heart to snatch thy gloss of sacred lore From the blind prophet of the public vote. Small help from such in life, or when thy pyre Cast far o'er Tuscan waves its mirrored fire! XVII Hark! She thou knew'st not mourns thee! Slowly tolls, As sinks the sun, yon church-tower o'er the sea: Abroad once more the peal funereal rolls, And Spezia now responds to Lerici: This day is sacred to Departed Souls; This day the Dead alone are great; and we Who live, or seem to live, but live to plead For the departed myriads at their need. XVIII Behold, the long procession scales the rock; In the red glare dusk banners sadly wave: Behold, the lambs of the immaculate flock Fling flowers on noted and on noteless grave: O Cross! sole Hope that dost not woo to mock! Some, some that knew thee not thou liv'st to save, At spirits not wholly—by their own decree— From infinite Love exiled, and lost to thee! SONNETS. 1. At times I lift mine eyes unto ‘the Hills Whence my salvation cometh’—ay, and higher— And, the mind kindling with the heart's desire, Mount to that realm nor blight nor shadow chills: With concourse of bright forms that region thrills: I see the Lost One midmost in the choir: From heaven to heaven, on wings that ne'er can tire, I soar; and God Himself my spirit fills. If that high rapture lasted need were none For aid beside, nor any meaner light, Nothing henceforth to seek, and nought to shun:— But my soul staggers at its noonday height And, stretching forth blind hands, a shape undone, Drops back into the gulfs of mortal night. August 6, 1846. 2. Then learn I that the Fancy's saintliest flight Gives or a fleeting, or a false relief; And fold my hands and say, ‘Let grief be grief, Let winter winter be, and blight be blight!’ O Thou all-wise, all-just, and infinite! Whate'er the good we clasped, the least, the chief, Was Thine, not ours, and held by us in fief; Thy Will consummate in my will's despite! ‘Blessèd the Dead:’ and they, they too, are blest Who, dead to earth, in full submission find, Buried in God's high Will, their Maker's rest: Kneeling, the blood-drops from the Saviour's feet, Their brows affusing, makes their Passion sweet; And in His sepulchre they sleep enshrined. August 6, 1846. 3. Alone, among thy books, once more I sit; No sound there stirs except the flapping fire: Strange shadows of old times about me flit As sinks the midnight lamp or flickers higher: I see thee pace the room: with eye thought-lit Back, back, thou com'st once more to my desire: Low-toned thou read'st once more the verse new-writ, Too deep, too pure for worldlings to admire. That brow all honour, that all-gracious hand, That cordial smile, and clear voice musical, That noble bearing, mien of high command, Yet void of pride—to-night I have them all. Ah, phantoms vain of thought! The Christmas air Is white with flying flakes. Where art thou—where? Christmas, 1860. 4. To-night upon thy roof the snows are lying; The Christmas snows lie heavy on thy trees: A dying dirge that soothes the year in dying Swells from thy woodlands on the midnight breeze. Our loss is ancient: many a heart is sighing This night, a late one, or by slow degrees Healssome old wound, to God's high grace replying:— A time there was when thou wert like to these. Where art thou? In what unimagined sphere Liv'st thou, sojourner, or no transient guest? By whom companioned? Access hath she near, In life thy nearest, and beloved the best? What memory hast thou of thy loved ones here? Hangs the great Vision o'er thy place of rest? Christmas, 1860. 5. ‘Sweet-sounding bells, blithe summoners to prayer!’ The answer man can yield not ye bestow: Your answer is a little Infant bare Wafted to earth on night-winds whispering low. Blow him to Bethlehem, airs angelic, blow! There doth the Mother-maid his couch prepare: His harbour is her bosom! Drop him there Soft as a snow-flake on a bank of snow. Sole Hope of man! Sole Hope for us, for Thee! ‘To us a Prince is given: a Child is born!’— Thou sang'st of Bethlehem, and of Calvary, A Song of Faith. By Sir Aubrey de Vere. The Maid Immaculate, and the twisted Thorn. Where'er thou art, not far, not far is He Whose banner whitens in yon Christmas morn! Christmas, 1860. ON REVISITING A SPOT BY THE ROTHA, NEAR AMBLESIDE. Oct 17, 1862. 6. I walked in dream. Alone the bright Boy stood Half imaged in the waters round his feet: His line had just been cast into the flood, Then first; his glance leaped forth the spoil to meet! The gold-brown curls about him waved, and sweet The blithesome smile of parted lips; the blood Flushing the fresh cheek like a rose whose hood With night-dews glittering, airs of morning greet. Ah me! Since there he stood full sixty years, Snow-laden, on their wintry pinions frore Have sailed beyond the limit of our spheres, And like that fleeting pageant are no more— That Boy my Father was! the autumnal day In 1845. He led me to that spot his hair was grey. A FRAGMENT. Like two smooth waves that o'er a foamless ocean On slide in sequence past a grassy lea, Made beautiful by sunrise and with motion Serener than unmoved tranquillity, Or like two gusts that toward one bowery shore Successive sweep in fragrance, then go by, Were those two Sisters. They who wept of yore This day partake their happy rest on high, Happier—how much—in heaven for each poor earthly sigh. I. WRITTEN AT VEVEY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1856. From terraced heights that rise in ranks Thick set with almond, fig, and maize, O'er waters blue as violet banks, I hear the songs of boyhood's days. Up walnut slopes, at morn and eve, And downward o'er the pearly shore From Clarens on they creep; nor leave Uncheered cold Chillon's dungeon-floor. Fair girls that please a mother's pride, Bright boys from joy of heart that sing, The voice of bridegroom and of bride, Through clustered vines how clear they ring! For me they blot these southern bowers: The ghosts of years gone by they wake: They send the drift of northern showers Low-whispering o'er a narrower lake. Once more upon the couch he lies Who ruled his halls with stately cheer; Waves slow the lifted hand; with eyes And lips rewards the strains most dear. And ah! from yon empurpled slope What fragrance swells that arch beneath! Geranium, jasmine, heliotrope— They stay my breath: of her they breathe! Flower-lover! wheresoe'er thou art May flowers and sunshine greet thee still, And voices vocal to the heart: No sound approach of sad or ill! II. WRITTEN NEAR SPEZIA, OCTOBER 19, 1856. In boyhood's flush when first I strayed 'Mid those delicious, classic climes, Troubling each river-bank and glade With petulance of forward rhymes, Of thee the oft recurrent thought Was yet but casual, and could pass, A brightness every shade might blot, An image faithless to its glass: But now that thou art gone, behold, Where'er I roam, whate'er I see, Of all I feel, the base or mould Is one unchanging thought of thee. Thousands with blank regard pass by All-gracious Nature's open doors: The barren heart, the beamless eye, Ah not for these her priceless stores! But thou, the nursling of the Muse— On hearts as pure, as still as thine, All beauty glistening lies like dews Upon the smooth leaf of the vine! Even now on yonder hill-girt plain Sea-lulled, and hollowed like a vase, I see thee gaze, and gaze again, With bright and ever-brightening face; And hear thee say, ‘More fair that vale, With happy hearths and homesteads strewn, Than Alpine summits darkly pale Where loveless grandeur reigns alone.’ III. WRITTEN IN ISCHIA, FEBRUARY 1, 1859. Here in this narrow island glen Between the dark hill and the sea, Remote from books, remote from men I sit; but O how near to thee! I bend above thy broidery frame; I smell thy flowers; thy voice I hear: Of Italy thou speak'st: that name Woke long thy wish; at last thy tear! Hadst thou but watched that azure deep; Those rocks with myrtles mantled o'er; Misenum's cape, yon mountains' sweep; The smile of that Circean shore! But seen yon crag's embattled crest, Whereon Colonna mourned alone, An eagle widowed in her nest, Heart strong and faithful as thine own! This was not in thy fates. Thy life Lay circled in a narrower bound: Child, sister, tenderest mother, wife— Love made that circle holy ground. Love blessed thy home—its trees, its earth, Its stones—that ofttimes trodden road Which linked the region of thy birth With that till death thy still abode. From the loud river's rocky beach To that clear lake the woodlands shade Love stretched his arms. In sight of each, The place of thy repose is made. IV. WRITTEN NEAR SPEZIA, 1864. Since last with thee, my guide unseen, I loved, where thou hadst loved, to stray, Eight years have passed; and, still heart-green, They tell me that my head is grey. Again I mark yon nectared plain: Again I pace the rhythmic shore: But o'er my gladness triumphs pain; I muse on things that are no more. With thee how fares it? Endless youth Is thine in regions still and pure: In climes of Beauty and of Truth Some place is thine, serene, secure. From thee the obscuring mist at last Is lifted; loosed the earthly bond: The gloomy gates of death are passed, And thine th' eternal Peace beyond: Not lonely peace! Thine earlier lost And latest, by thy side or knee, With thee from that celestial coast Look down as when they waited thee, Singing those hymns that, earthward borne, To these dull ears at last make way From realms where life is always morn, And climes where Godhead is the day. TO A BIBLE. She read thee to the last, beloved Book! Her wasted fingers 'mid thy pages strayed; Upon thy promises her heart was stayed; Upon thy letters lingered her last look Ere life and love those gentlest eyes forsook: Upon thy gracious words she daily fed; And by thy light her faltering feet were led When loneliness her inmost being shook. O Friend, O Saviour, O sustaining Word, Whose conquering feet the Spirit-land have trod, Be near her where she is, Incarnate Lord! In the mysterious silence of the tomb Where righteous spirits wait their final doom, Forsake her not, O Omnipresent God! E. SPRING. Winter, that hung around us as a cloud, Rolls slowly backward; from her icy sleep Th' awakened earth starts up and shouts aloud, The waters leap From rock to rock with a tumultuous mirth, With Bacchanalian madness and loud song; From the fond bosom of the teeming earth All young things throng; And hopes rise bubbling from the deepest fountain Of man's half-frozen heart. Faith trustingly Rests its broad base on God, as doth a mountain Upon the sea. Affections pure, and human sympathies The summer sun of charity relumes, That fire divine that warms and vivifies, But not consumes. Love, vernal music, charity, hope, faith, Warm the cold earth, fair visions from on high, Teaching to scorn and trample fear of death; For naught can die. S. E. de Vere. STANZAS. Although I know that all my love, My true love, is in vain; yet I Must loose the strainèd cord that holds My bursting heart within its folds, And love or die. Dear is the breath of early Spring To the low-crouching violet; The grateful river smiles upon The glories of the sinking sun; But dearer yet Than breath of Spring to the young flower, Or sun-burst to the clouded sea, One glance of pity from thine eye, The music of thy faintest sigh, Sweet love, to me. This dreary world is very cold: A heavy sorrow presses down My famished heart. One tear-drop shed In memory of the faithful dead, When I am gone. S. E. de Vere. CHARITY. Though all the world reject thee, yet will I Fold thee, with all thine errors, in my heart, And cherish even thy weakness! Who can say That he is free from sin; or that to him Belongs to speak the judgments of the Lord, To vindicate the majesty of Heaven? Behold the Master! prostrate at His feet, Shuddering with penitential agony, Magdalen! O those mild forgiving eyes, Mercy and pity blossoming in Love! O lips full founts of pardon and of blessing! Shall I, a sinner, scorn a sinner, or Less love my brother seeing he is weak? Shall not my heart yearn to his helplessness Like the fond mother's to her idiot boy? O cruel mockery, to call that love Which the world's frown can wither! Hypocrite! False friend! Base selfish man! fearing to lift Thy soilèd fellow from the dust! From thee The love of friends, the sympathy of kind Recoil like broken waves from a bare cliff, Waves that from far seas come with noiseless step Slow stealing to some lonely ocean isle;— With what tumultuous joy and fearless trust They fling themselves upon its blackened breast, And wind their arms of foam around its feet, Seeking a home; but finding none, return With slow, sad ripple, and reproachful murmur. No! No! True Charity scorns not the love Even of the guiltiest, but treasures up The precious gift within its heart of hearts, Freely returning love where wanted most, Like flowers that from the generous air imbibe The essences of life, and give them forth Again in odours. Spirit of Love Divine That filledst with tenderness the reverent eyes Of Mary as she gazed upon her Babe, Soften our stony nature; make us know How much we need to be forgiven; build up True Charity on humbleness of heart. S. E. de Vere. ODE. THE ASCENT OF THE APPENNINES. May, 1859. I. I move through a land like a land of dream, Where the things that are, and that shall be, seem Wov'n into one by a hand of air, And the Good looks piercingly down through the Fair! No form material is here unmated; Here blows no bud, no scent can rise, No song ring forth, unconsecrated To meaning or model in Paradise! Fallen, like man, is elsewhere man's earth; Human, at best, in her sadness and mirth; Or if she aspires after something greater, Lifting her hands from her native dust, In God she beholds but the Wise, the Just; The Saviour she sees not in the Creator: But here, like children of Saints who learn The things above ere the things below, Who choirs angelic in clouds discern Ere the butterfly's wing from the moth's they know, True Nature as ashes all beauty reckons That claims not hereafter some happier birth; She calls from the height to the depth; she beckons From the nomad waste to a heavenly hearth: ‘The Curse is cancelled,’ she cries; ‘thou dreamer, Earth felt the tread of her great Redeemer!’ II. Ye who ascend with reverent foot The warm vale's rocky stairs, Though lip be mute, in heart salute With praises and with prayers The noble hands, now dust, that reared Long ages since on crag or sward Those Stations that from their cells revered Still preach the Saviour-Lord! Ah! unseductive here the breath Of the vine-bud that blows in the breast of morn; That orange bower, yon jasmine wreath, Hide not the crown of thorn! Here none can bless the spring, and drink Those waters from the dark that burst, Nor see the sponge and reed, and think Of the Three Hours' unquenchèd thirst. The Tender, the Beauteous receives its comment From a truth transcendent, a life divine; And the coin flung loose of the passing moment Is stamped with Eternity's sign! III. Alas those days of yore When Nature lay vassal to pagan lore! Baia—what was she? A sorceress still To brute transforming the human will! Nor pine could whisper, nor breeze could move But a breath infected ran o'er the blood Like gales that whiten the aspen grove Or gusts that darken the flood. Beside blue ocean's level The beauteous base ones The ‘Ambubajæ.’ held their revel, Dances on the sea-sand knitting, With shouts the sleeping shepherd scaring, Like Oreads o'er the hill-side flitting, Like Mænads thyrsus-bearing. The Siren sang from the moonlit bay, The Siren sang from the redd'ning lawn, Until in the feastful cup of day Lay melted the pearl of dawn. Unspiritual intelligence Changed Nature's fane to a hall of sense, That rings with the upstart spoiler's jest, And the beakers clashed by the drunken guest! IV. Hark to that convent bell! False pagan world, farewell; From cliff to cliff the challenge vaults rebounded! Echo, her wanderings done, Heart-peace at last hath won, The rest of love on Faith not Fancy founded; ‘By the parched fountain let the pale flower die,’ She sings, ‘True Love, true Joy, triumphant reign on high!’ V. The plains recede; the olives dwindle; Lleave the chestnut slopes behind; The skirts of the billowy pine-woods kindle In the evening lights and wind: Not here we sigh for the Alpine glory Of peak primeval and death-pale snow; For the cold grey mere, and the glacier hoary, Or blue caves that yawn below: The landscape here is mature and mellow; Fruit-like, not flower-like:—hills embrowned; Ridges of purple and ledges of yellow From runnel to rock church-crowned: 'Tis a region of mystery, hushed and sainted: Serene as the pictures of artists old When Giotto the thoughts of his Dante painted:— The summit is reached! Behold! Like a sky condensed lies the lake far down; Its curves like the orbit of some fair planet; A fire-wreath falls on the cliffs that frown Above it, dark walls of granite; The hill-sides with homesteads and hamlets glow; With wave-washed villages zoned below: Down drops by the island's woody shores The bannered barge with its gleam of oars. No solitude here, no desert cheerless Is needed pure thoughts or hearts to guard; 'Tis a ‘populous solitude,’ festal, fearless, For men of good-will prepared. The hermit may hide in the wood, but o'er it Three times each day the chimes are rolled: The black crag woos the cloud, but before it The procession winds on white-stoled. Farewell, O Nature! None meets thee here But his heart goes up to a happier sphere! He sees, from the blossom of sense unfolded By the Paraclete's breath, its divine increase, Rose-leaf on rose-leaf in sanctity moulded, The flower of Eternal Peace; The home and the realm of man's race above; The Vision of Truth, and the Kingdom of Love! VI. There shall the features worn and wasted Let fall the sullen mask of years: There shall that fruit at last be tasted Whose seed was sown in tears: There shall that amaranth bloom for ever Whose blighted blossom drooped erewhile In this dim valley of exile, And by the Babylonian river. The loved and lost once more shall meet us; Delights that never were ours shall greet us; Delights for the love of the Cross foregone Fullfaced salute us, ashamed of none. Heroes unnamed the storm that weathered There shall sceptred stand and crowned; Apostles the wildered flocks that gathered Sit, throned with nations round. There, heavenly sweets from the earthly bitter Shall rise like odour from herbs down-trod; There, tears of the past like gems shall glitter On trees that gladden the mount of God. The deeds of the righteous, on earth despised, By the lightning of God immortalized Shall crown like statues the walls sublime Of all the illuminate, mystic City, Memorial emblems that conquer Time, Yet tell his tale. That Pity Which gave the lost one strength to speak, That love in guise angelic stooping O'er the grey old head, or the furrowed cheek, Or the neck depressed and drooping, Shall live for aye, at a flash transferred From the wastes of earth to the courts of the Word; The Thoughts of the Just, their frustrate schemes, Shall lack not a place in the wondrous session; The Prayers of the Saints, their griefs, their dreams, Shall be manifest there in vision; For they live in the Mind Divine, their mould, That Mind Divine the unclouded mirror Wherein the glorified Spirits behold All worlds, undimmed by error. VII. Fling fire on the earth, O God, Consuming all things base! Fling fire upon man, his soul and his blood, The fire of Thy Love and Grace: That his heart once more to its natal place Like a bondsman freed may rise, Ascending for ever before Thy face From the altar of Sacrifice! And thou, Love's comrade, Hope, That yield'st to Wisdom strength, to Virtue scope, That giv'st to man and nation The on-rushing plumes of spiritual aspiration, Van-courier of the ages, Faith's swift guide, That still the attained foregoest for the descried; On, Seraph, on, through night and tempest winging! On heavenward, on, across the void, vast hollow! And be it ours, to thy wide skirts close clinging Blindly, like babes, thy conquering flight to follow: What though the storm of Time roar back beside us? Though this world mock or chide us? We shall not faint or fail until at last The eternal shore is reached, all peril past! A MOTHER'S SONG. I. O Time, whose silent foot down treads The kingly towers and groves, Who lay'st on loftiest, loveliest heads, The hand that no man loves, Take all things else beneath the skies, But spare one infant's laughing eyes. II. O Time, who build'st the coral reef, Whom dried-up torrents fear, And rocks far hurled, like storm-blown sheaf, From peak to glacier drear, Waste all things else; but spare the while The lovelight of one infant's smile! III. Where sunflowers late from Summer's mint Brought back the age of gold, Through thee once more the sleet showers dint The black and bloomless mould: But harm not, Time, and guard, O Nature, What is not yours—this living creature! IV. From God's great love a Soul forth sprang That ne'er till then had being: The courts of heaven with anthems rang: He blessed it, He the All-seeing! Nor suns nor moons, nor heaven nor earth, Can shape a Soul or match in worth. V. No thought of thee when o'er the leas A child I raced delighted; No thought when under garden trees A girlish troth I plighted: We knew not what the church bells said That giddy morn the girl was wed: Of thee they babbled, pretty maid! A GIRL'S SONG. Unkind was he, the first who sang The spring-time shamed, the flower's decay! What woman yet without a pang Could hear of Beauty's fleeting May? O Beauty! with me bide, and I A maid will live, a maid will die. Could I be always fair as now, And hear, as now, the Poets sing ‘The long-lashed eyes, the lustrous brow, The hand well worthy kiss and ring,’ Then, then some casual grace were all That e'er from me on man should fall! I sailed last night on Ina's stream: Warm 'mid the wave my fingers lay; The cold-lipped Naiad in my dream Kissed them, and sighed, and slipped away— Ah me! down life's descending tide Best things, they say, the swiftliest glide. A SONG OF AGE. I Who mourns? Flow on, delicious breeze! Who mourns, though youth and strength go by? Fresh leaves invest the vernal trees, Fresh airs will drown my latest sigh: This frame is but a part outworn Of earth's great Whole that lifts more high A tempest-freshened brow each morn To meet pure beams and azure sky. II Thou world-renewing breath, sweep on, And waft earth's sweetness o'er the wave! That earth will circle round the sun When God takes back the life He gave! To each his turn! Even now I feel The feet of children press my grave, And one deep whisper o'er it steal— ‘The Soul is His Who died to save.’ A CHRISTIAN MAID. Her coral lip a sunbeam smote; Behind her shapely head The white veil refluent seemed to float Like cloud in ether spread: She looked so noble, sweet and good, Love clapped his hands for glee, And cried, ‘This, this is Womanhood— The rest but female be!’ So modest yet confiding too, So tender to bestow On each that loving honour due To all things, high or low, Her soft self-reverence part had none In consciousness or pride, A reflex of that worship won From her by all beside. So creaturely in all her ways, So humbly great she seemed— O Grecian lays, O Pagan praise, Of such ye never dreamed! Through sunshine on she moved as one Innocuously possest— Thy lot reversed, O Babylon!— By some angelic guest. Buoyant as bird in leafy bower, As calm she looked as those Who long have worn the nuptial flower Upon their matron brows: Yet ten years hence, when girl and boy May mount her lap at will, That virgin grace, that vestal joy Now hers will haunt her still! A CHRISTIAN POETESS. ADELAIDE PROCTOR. She stooped o'er earth's poor brink, light as a breeze That bathes, enraptured, in clear morning seas, And round her, like that wandering Minstrel, sent Twofold delight—music with freshness blent: Ere long in night her snowy wings she furled, Waiting the sunrise of a happier world, And God's New Song. O Spirit crystalline, What lips shall better waft it on than thine? IN MEMORY OF EDWIN, EARL OF DUNRAVEN. Once more I pace thy pillared halls, And hear the organ echoes sigh In blissful death on storied walls: But where art thou? not here; nor nigh. Once more the rapt spring-breezes send A flash o'er yonder winding flood, And with the garden's fragrance blend A fresher breath from lawn and wood. Friend! where art thou? Thy works reply; The lowly School; the high-arched Fane: Who loves his kind can never die: Who serves his God, with God shall reign. Adare, 1873. EPITAPH. Great Love, death-humbled, yields awhile to earth Its Bright One, waiting there the immortal birth: Rich Love, made poor, can trust one Hope alone, Its best, its holiest, to the cold grave-stone: Eternal Easter of that Hope, be born! The pure make perfect; comfort the forlorn. AN EPITAPH WITHOUT A NAME. I had a Name. A wreath of woven air, A wreath of Letters blended, none knew why, Floated, a vocal phantom, here and there, For one brief season, like the dragon-fly That flecks the noontide beam, Flickering o'er downward, forest-darkened stream. What word those Letters shaped I tell you not: Wherefore should such this maiden marble blot? Faint echo, last and least, of foolish Fame, I am a Soul; nor care to have a Name. EPITAPH. From Youth's soft haunt she passed to Love's fair nest;— Thence on to larger Love and heavenlier rest: Four years their sunshine, two their shadows lent To enrich a heart with either lot content. Pray well, pure Spirit! and some sad grace accord To him once more thy suppliant; once thy lord. AGE. Old age! The sound is harsh, and grates: Yet Life's a semblance, not a Truth: Time binds an hourly changing mask On Souls in changeless light that bask— Younger we grow when near the gates Of everlasting Youth! GENIUS AND SANCTITY. “How high he soars!” Few say it when the flight Is highest. Saints escape the vulgar sight. DEATH. Why shrink from Death? In ancient days, we know, The slave was raised to freedom by a blow:— Man's prison-house, not man, the hand of Death lays low. FEBRUARY. What dost thou, laggard Daffodil, Tarrying so long beneath the sod? Hesper, thy mate, o'er yonder hill Looks down and strikes with silver rod The pools that mirrored thee last year, Yet cannot find thee far or near. Pale Primrose! for a smile of thine Gladly to earth these hands would pour An ivied urn of purple wine, Such as at Naxos Bacchus bore Watching with fixed black eyes the while That pirate bark draw near his isle! Shake down, dark Pine, thy scalp of snow: False witch, stripped bare, grim Ash-tree tall! Ye ivy masses that now swing slow Now shudder in spasms on the garden wall, Shake down your load and the black mould strew; The rosemary borders and banks of rue. The Robin, winter's Nightingale, Hung mute to-day on the blackthorn brake: We heard but the water-fowl pipe and wail Fluting aloud on the lake; Who hears that bell-note so clear and free, Though inland he stands, beholds the sea. As the moon that rises of saffron hue Ascending, changes to white, So the year, with the Daffodil rising new, On Narcissus will soon alight: Rise up, thou Daffodil, rise! With thee The year begins, and the spring-tide glee! THE MATERIALIST'S RELIGION; OR, PESSIMISM'S ‘DOWNWARD WAY.’ Ye Twelve Olympians crowned for aye, Hurl back the Furies and the Fates! Nightmares of Conscience, hence, away, Beyond your famed Tartarean Gates! Ye Woodgods, Lords of Lawlessness, That din the dusk with bounding hoof, Drive back the Olympian Twelve no less: Their starry stillness means Reproof. Ye children, scare with cowslip ball Those Woodgods last! With idle breath They mock that king who draggeth all Into his own dread silence—Death. Faith darkens, Love distempers, life: The chaplets fade on Fancy's brow: Come, Iris, with thy painless knife: The last of Gods, and best, art thou! SONG. THE FLOWER OF THE TREE. I O the flower of the tree is the flower for me, That life out of life, high-hanging and free, By the finger of God and the south wind's fan Drawn from the broad bough, as Eve from Man! From the rank red earth it never upgrew: It was woo'd from the bark in the glistening blue. II Hail, blossoms green 'mid the limes unseen, That charm the bees to your honeyed screen, As like to the green trees that gave you birth As true tongue's kindness to true heart's worth! We see you not; but, we scarce know why, We are glad when the air you have breathed goes by. III O flowers of the lime! 'twas a merry time When under you first we read old rhyme, And heard the wind roam over pale and park, We, not I, 'mid the lime-grove dark; Summer is heavy and sad. Ye bring With your tardy blossoms a second Spring. EPIGRAMS. Our new Reformation abhors the “Dogmatical” As unmeet for an age so enlarged, and exotic:— Why stop at the Credo, O seers unfanatical? Don't you think the Commandments a little despotic? With Clio's aid old Homer sang, 'tis known:— When Batho sings, the merit's all his own. Inconstant thou! There ne'er was any Till now so constant—to so many! ON A GREAT PLAGIARIST. Phœbus drew back with just disdain The wreath: the Delphic Temple frowned: The suppliant fled to Hermes' fane, That stood on lower, wealthier ground. The Thief-God spake, with smile star-bright: ‘Go thou where luckier poets browse The pastures of the Lord of Light, And do—what I did with his cows.’ He stole, killed, and ate the whole of Apollo's herd before he was a day old.—See Homer's Hymn to Mercury. THE TRUE HARP. Soul of the Bard! stand up, like thy harp's majestical pillar! Heart of the Bard, like its arch in reverence bow thee and bend! Mind of the Bard, like its strings be manifold, changeful, responsive: This is the harp God smites, the harp, man's master and friend! SELF-LOVE. Light-winged Loves! they come; they flee: If we were dead they'd never miss us: Self-Love! with thee is Constancy— Thine eyes to one were true, Narcissus! THE SERIOUS ‘VIVE LA BAGATELLE.’ Bright world! you may write on my heart what you will, But write it with pencil not pen: Your hand hath its skill: but a hand finer still Will whiten your tablet again. To the moment its laugh, and its smile to the flower! Not niggard we give them: but why? Old Time must devour the year as the hour: Our trust is Eternity. TO A FORMALIST. On paper ruled Nature your virtues writ— Why not erase the lines? Ah scant of wit! SONNETS. I. WORDSWORTH. COMPOSED AT RYDAL.—1. September, 1860. The last great man by manlier times bequeathed To these our noisy and self-boasting days In this green valley rested, trod these ways, With deep calm breast this air inspiring breathed: True bard, because true man, his brow he wreathed With wild-flowers only, singing Nature's praise; But Nature turned, and crowned him with her bays, And said, ‘Be thou my Laureate.’ Wisdom sheathed In song love-humble; contemplations high, That built like larks their nests upon the ground; Insight and vision; sympathies profound That spanned the total of humanity; These were the gifts which God poured forth at large On men through him; and he was faithful to his charge. II. WORDSWORTH, ON VISITING THE DUDDON. See Wordsworth's Sonnet to the Poet Dyer.—2. So long as Duddon 'twixt his cloud-girt walls Thridding the woody chambers of the hills Warbles from vaulted grot and pebbled halls Welcome or farewell to the meadow rills; So long as linnets pipe glad madrigals Near that brown nook the labourer whistling tills, Or the late-reddening apple forms and falls 'Mid dewy brakes the autumnal redbreast thrills, So long, last poet of the great old race, Shall thy broad song through England's bosom roll, A river singing anthems in its place, And be to later England as a soul. Glory to Him Who made thee, and increase, To them that hear thy word, of love and peace! III. WORDSWORTH, ON VISITING THE DUDDON.—3. When first that precinct sacrosanct I trod Autumn was there, but Autumn just begun; Fronting the portals of a sinking sun The queen of quietude in vapour stood, Her sceptre o'er the dimly-crimsoned wood Resting in light. The year's great work was done; Summer had vanished, and repinings none Troubled the pulse of thoughtful gratitude. Wordsworth! the autumn of our English song Art thou: 'twas thine our vesper psalms to sing: Chaucer sang matins; sweet his note and strong; His singing-robe the green, white garb of Spring: Thou like the dying year art rightly stoled; Pontific purple and dark harvest gold. IV. SELF-DECEPTION. Like mist it tracks us wheresoe'er we go, Like air bends with us ever as we bend; And, as the shades at noontide darkest grow, At times with Virtue's growth its snares ascend: Weakness with wisdom skilled it is to blend, Breed baser life from buried sins laid low, Make void our world of God and good, yet lend The spirit's waste a paradisal glow. O happy children simple even in wiles! And ye of single eye, thrice happy Poor! Practised self-love, that cheat which slays with smiles, Weaves not for you the inevitable lure. Men live a lie: specious their latest breath: Welcome, delusion-slayer, truthful Death! V. POETIC RESERVE. Not willingly the Muses sing of love: But, ere their Songs disperse o'er man's domain, Through the dark chambers of the poet's brain They pass, and passing take the stamp thereof: And, as the wind that sweeps the linden grove Wafts far its odour, so that sphere-born Strain Learns from its mortal mould to mourn and plain, Though the strong Muses sit like Gods above. True poetry is doubly-dowered—a brightness Lit from above yet fuelled from below; A moon that rolls through heaven in vestal whiteness, Yet, earthward stooping, wears an earthly glow. Mysteries the Muse would hide the Bards reveal: They love to wound: her mission is to heal. VI. ON A GREAT FUNERAL. No more than this? The chief of nations bears Her chief of sons to his last resting-place: Through the still city, sad and slow of pace The sable pageant streams: and as it nears That dome, to-day a vault funereal, tears Run down the grey-haired veteran's wintry face; Deep organs sob; and flags their front abase; And the snapt wand the rite complete declares. —Soul, that before thy Judge dost stand this day, Disrobed of strength and puissance, pomp and power; O Soul defrauded at thine extreme hour Of man's sole help from man, and latest stay, Swells there for thee no prayer from all that host? Is this blank burial but a Nation's boast? VII.TO CHARLES ELIOT NORTON.—1. On reading his ‘Vita Nuova’ of Dante, March 28, 1860. Norton! I would that oft in years to come The destined bard of that brave land of thine America. Sole-seated 'neath the tempest-roughened pine, In boyhood's spring when genius first doth plume Her wing, 'mid forest scents and insects' hum And murmurs from the far sea crystalline May smell this blossom from the Tuscan vine, May hear this voice from antique Christendom; For thus from love and purity and might Shall he receive his armour, and forth fare Champion elect in song, that country's knight Who early burst the chain weak nations bear Weeping. 'Mid trumpet-blasts and standards torn To manhood, with loud cries, thy land was born! VIII. TO THE SAME.—2. June 12, 1861. ‘To manhood with loud cries thy land was born’— Was born! is born! Her trumpets peal this hour The authentic voice of Nationhood and Power! The iron in her soul indignant worn This day she tramples down. Her lips have sworn To lift the dusky race in chains that cower; And if once more the tempests round her lour Her smile goes through them like the smile of morn! Great Realm! The men that in thy sunnier day Looked on thee dubious or with brow averse, Now thou hast put the evil thing away, Our sin and thine, Time's dread transmitted curse, Send up their prayers to prop that lifted hand Which gives to God a liberated Land! IX. THE AMERICAN STRUGGLE.—1. The Principle. February 20, 1865. Sword! ere the sheath that hid thy light so long That splendour quench, go thou like lightning forth, High Bride of Justice, not of South or North, And raise, as now the weak, and quell the strong! Advance, till from the black man's hearth the song Rises to God, and by the black man's hearth Humanity hath leave in godly mirth To sit, forgetful of her ancient wrong. Then rest for ever; for to work like thine While the world lasts no other can succeed Equal, or second. Hang in heaven, a Sign, But stoop no more to earth or earthly need, Nor ever leave thy starry home august, Vassal of vulgar wars, and prone Ambition's lust. X. THE AMERICAN STRUGGLE.—2. PRINCIPLE A POWER; OR, LOGIC IN HISTORY, FEBRUARY 21, 1865. Lo! as an eagle battling through a cloud That from his neck all night the vapour flings, And ploughs the dark, till downward from his wings Sunrise, long waited, smites some shipwrecked crowd Beneath a blind sea-cavern bent and bowed;— Thus through the storm of Men, the night of Things, That Principle to which the issue clings Makes fateful way, and spurns at last its shroud. There were that saw it with a sceptic ken: There were that saw it not through hate or pride: But, conquering and to conquer, on it came, No tool of man but making tools of men, Till Nations shook beneath its advent wide, And they that loosed the Portent rued the same. XI. THE CENTENARY OF AMERICAN LIBERTY. A century of sunrises hath bowed Its fulgent forehead 'neath the ocean-floor Since first upon the West's astonished shore, Like some huge Alp, forth struggling through the cloud, A new-born nation stood, to Freedom vowed: Within that time how many an Empire hoar And young Republic, flushed with wealth and war, Alike have changed the ermine for the shroud! O ‘sprung from earth's first blood,’ O tempest-nursed, For thee what Fates? I know not. This I know, The Soul's great freedom, gift, of gifts the first, Thou first on man in fulness didst bestow; Hunted elsewhere, God's Church with thee found rest: Thy future's Hope is she—that queenly Guest. XII. ROBERT ISAAC WILBERFORCE. ‘No way but this.’ There where the pleasant shade Dropped from the ledges of the Alban hill Creeps to the vast Campagna and is still, The mightier shadow reached him! Prayer was made: But he to God his tribute just had paid, And earned his rest. The deep recalled the rill: A long life's labour with a perfect will He on the altar of the Church had laid. Child of the old English Learning sage and pure, Authentic, manly, grave, without pretence, From this poor stage of changeful time and sense Released, sleep well, of thy reward secure: Beside the Apostles' threshold thou dost lie, Waiting, well-pleased, thy great eternity. Rome, 1857. XIII. ‘LE RÉCIT D'UNE SŒUR.’—1. Whence is the music? minstrel see we none; Yet soft as waves that, surge succeeding surge, Roll forward, now subside, anon emerge, Upheaved in glory o'er a setting sun, Those beatific harmonies sweep on! O'er earth they sweep from heaven's remotest verge Triumphant hymeneal, hymn, and dirge, Blending in everlasting unison. Whence is the music? Stranger! these were they That, great in love, by love unvanquished proved: These were true lovers, for in God they loved: With God, these Spirits rest in endless day, Yet still for Love's behoof, on wings outspread Float on o'er earth, betwixt the Angels and the Dead! XIV. ‘LE RÉCIT D'UNE SŒUR.’—2.ALEXANDRINE. Between two graves, a sister's grave and one Wherein the husband of her youth was laid, In countenance half a Spirit, half a Nun, She stood: a breeze that branch of jasmine swayed In her slight hand upholden: ‘Peace!’ she said:— A smile all gold to meet the sinking sun Came forth: the pale, worn face transfigured shone Sun-like beneath the sorrowing widow-braid. She raised that branch, away her tears to wipe— ‘How happy seemed our life twelve years ago! I weep him still, but gaily weep at last! Like some sweet day-dream looks that earthly past: Of genuine joy the pledge it was, the type: Now, now alone the joy itself I know!’ XV. A WINTER NIGHT IN THE WOODS. When first the Spring her glimmering chaplets wove This way and that way 'mid the boughs high hung, We watched the hourly work, while thrushes sung A song that shook with joy their bowered alcove: Summer came next: she roofed with green the grove, And deepening shades to flower-sweet alleys clung: Then last—one dirge from many a golden tongue— The chiding leaves with chiding Autumn strove. These were but Nature's preludes. Last is first! Winter, uplifting high both flail and fan, With the great forests dealt as Death with man; And therefore through their desolate roofs hath burst This splendour veiled no more by earthly bars; Infinite heaven, and the fire-breathing stars! XVI. POLAND AND RUSSIA.—1. When, fixed in righteous wrath, a Nation's eye Torments some crowned Tormentor with just hate, Nor threat nor flattery may that gaze abate: Unshriven the unatoning years go by: For, as that starry Archer Sagittarius. in the sky Unbends not his bright bow, though early and late The Siren sings, and folly weds with fate, Even so that sure though silent Destiny Which keeps fire-vigil in God's judgment-heaven Upon the countenance of the Doomed looks forth Consentient with a Nation's gaze on earth: To those twinned Powers a single gaze is given: The earthly Fate reveals the Fate on high— A Brazen Serpent raised, that says not, ‘live,’ but ‘die!’ XVII. POLAND AND RUSSIA.—2. The Strong One with the Weak One reasons thus: ‘Through sin of thine our eagle wings are clipt: Through frost of thine our summer branch is nipt: Thy wounds accuse: thy rags are mutinous: The nations note thine aspect dolorous Like some starved shape that cowers in charnel crypt, Or landscape in eclipse perpetual dipt, And, ignorant, cavil, not at thee but us!’ Then answer makes that worn voice, stern and slow: ‘Am I a dog the scourger's hand that licks, And fattens? Blind reproof but spurns the pricks. That which I am thou mad'st me! long ago My face thou grav'dst to be a face of woe, Fixed as the fixed face of a Crucifix.’ XVIII. GALATEA AND URANIA; OR, ART AND FAITH. ‘Dread Venerable Goddess, whom I fear, Gaze not upon me from thy starry height! I fear thy levelled shafts of ruthless light, Thine unfamiliar radiance and severe: Thy sceptre bends not! stern, defined, and clear Thy Laws: thy face intolerantly bright: Thine is the empire of the Ruled and Right: Never hadst thou a part in smile or tear! I love the curving of the wind-arched billow; The dying flute tone, sweeter for its dying: To me less dear the Pine tree than the Willow, The mountain than the shadows o'er it flying.’ Thus Galatea sang, whilst o'er the waters Urania leant; and cowered 'mid Ocean's foam-white daughters. XIX. COMMON LIFE. Onward between two mountain warders lies The field that man must till. Upon the right, Church-thronged, with summit hid by its own height, Swells the vast range of the Theologies: Upon the left the hills of Science rise Lustrous but cold: nor flower is there, nor blight: Between those ranges twain through shade and light Winds the low vale wherein the meek and wise Repose. The knowledge that excludes not doubt Is there; the arts that beautify man's life: There rings the choral psalm, the civic shout, The genial revel, and the manly strife: There by the bridal rose the cypress waves: And theretheall-blest sunshine softest falls on graves. XX. TO KEATS. Written in early youth. Peace, peace, or mourn the living! Ye but hold A shadow to your bosoms. He hath quaffed Glory and Death in one immortal draught; Surely among the undying men of old Numbered art thou, great Heart; in heaven enrolled Among the eternal Splendours that rain forth Love, light, and peace on our unquiet earth, O latest radiance of the starry fold. Below, thou liv'st, a consecrated name; Above, with naked feet unscorched and hair Unsinged thou walkest through that fierce white fire Which mantles like a robe of golden air Homer and Shakespeare, and the burning choir, Rejoicing in the fullness of thy fame. XXI. MODERN DESPONDENCY. Written in Devonshire. Soft land, and gracious as some nectarous fruit In whose warm bosom Autumn's heart is glad, Thou hadst of old thy bards, Brown, Herrick, and others. whose lyre and lute Well praised thy joyous woodlands blossom-clad: Thou hadst thy blithesome days! If ours be sad, May thy blue bays and orchards never mute That sadness charm—slay causeless sorrow's root— Loveless self-will, the pride that maketh mad! Wed, blameless nature, wed with grace divine Once more, like sweet harps blent with sweeter voices, Thy powers: then sing, till child and man rejoices Betwixt those ‘Double Seas’ of England! Shine, Sun of past years! Disperse those modern glooms At least from golden Devon's Tors and Coombes! XXII. PONTEFRACT CASTLE; OR, TREASON'S TWOFOLD BEQUEST. Wind-wasted castle without crown of towers! Dread dungeon keep, watching the dying day! A crownless king, great Edward's grandson, Richard II. lay Wasting in thee, and counting prisoned hours: A century passed: the Faith's embattled Powers Thus far advanced; here stood, a stag at bay: The eighth Henry trembled in his blood-stained bowers;— Thou saw'st that ‘Pilgrimage of Grace’ decay! Two Woes thou saw'st; the fall of England's Crown, That drowned in blood her old Nobility; Then, baser plague, the old Temples trampled down By Despots new! Twice-doomed! the fount in thee I mark of that Red Sea The Wars of the Roses. which rolls between England that is, and England that hath been! XXIII. INDUSTRY. Virtue defamed for sordid, rough, and coarse, Unworthy of the glimpses of the moon, Praise of the clown alone whose heavy shoon Kneads the moist clay, nor spares the pure stream's source, In thee how strong is grace! how fair is force! How generous art thou, and to man how boon! Not thine the boastful plain with carnage strewn, Nor chambers, wassail-shamed, where late Remorse Sits, the last guest! From ocean on to ocean, From citied shore to hills far-forested, The increase of earth is thine, in rest or motion; The crown is thine on every Sage's head; The ship, the scythe, the rainbow among flowers: Thine too the song of girls exulting 'mid their bowers. XXIV. TO THE MOST FAIR. Fair, noble, young! Of thee I thought to sing, (If so Love willed, and the ever-virgin Muse Who cannot grace accord unless Love choose, Were pleased from Love's first bath, Castalia's Spring, One flower or sparkling drop on me to fling) For ofttimes thus some clan barbaric strews Their earth and wood, the little island's dues, Before his feet whom conquest made its king: So dreamed I, when, a mourner sad and stern, The Muses' Mother fixed on me her eyes— Memory—nor slow their meaning to discern Like a child stung I dropped the forfeit prize: Some holier hand from out the immortal river The destined reed must draw, and hymn thy praise for ever! XXV. IN MEMORY OF THE LATE SIR JOHN SIMEON.—1.Feast of the Purification, 1873. This day we keep our Candlemas in snow: Wan is the sky; a bitter wind and drear Wrinkles the bosom of yon blackening mere: Of these I reck not, but of thee, and O! Of that bright Roman morn, so long ago, When, children new of her, that Church more dear To liegeful hearts with each injurious year, We watched the famed Procession circling slow. Once more I see it wind with lights upholden On through the Sistine, on and far away: Once more I mark beneath its radiance golden Thy forehead shine, and, with it kindling, say, ‘Rehearsals dim were those, O friend: this hour Surely God's light it is that on thee rests in power!’ XXVI. IN MEMORY OF THE LATE SIR JOHN SIMEON.—2. Again we met. We trod the fields and farms Of that fair isle, thy happy English home; We gazed upon blue sea, and snowy foam Clipt in the jutting headland's woody arms: The year had reached the fulness of her charms: The Church's year, from strength to strength increased, Its zenith held, that great Assumption feast Whose sun with annual joy the whole earth warms. That day how swiftly rushed from thy full heart Hope's glorying flood! How high thy fancy soared, Kenning, though far, once more thine England's crest A light to Christendom's old heaven restored! ‘In a large room’ thy heart its home had found: The land we trod that day to thee was holy ground. XXVII. IN MEMORY OF THE LATE SIR JOHN SIMEON.—3. The world external knew thee but in part: It saw and honoured what was least in thee; The loyal trust, the inborn courtesy; The ways so winning, yet so pure from art; The cordial reverence, keen to all desert, All save thine own; the accost so frank and free; The public zeal that toiled, but not for fee, And shunned alike base praise and hireling's mart: These things men saw; but deeper far than these The under-current of thy soul worked on Unvexed by surface-ripple, beam, or breeze, And unbeheld its way to ocean won: Life of thy life was still that Christian Faith The sophist scorns. It failed thee not in death. XXVIII. THE POETRY OF THE FUTURE. An anticipation addressed to a young authoress. Go forth, fair Book! Go, countenanced like that Man Upon whose brow all Eden's light was stayed; Beauteous as Truth, go forth to cheer and aid, Breathing of greatness ours ere sin began; With angel-wing from eyes earth-wearied fan Convention's mist; revive great hopes that fade; Bid nature rule where reigned but masquerade; Bear witness to that joy divine which ran Down to creation's heart, while, bending o'er it, The great Creator saw that all was good, That mightier joy, when, dying to restore it, He rose Who washed it in His conquering Blood: Go forth, a seer in minstrel raiment clad; Say to the meek, ‘Be strong;’ the pure, ‘Be glad!’ XXIX. THE RUINS OF EMANIA, NEAR ARMAGH. Why seek ye thus the living 'mid the dead? Beneath that mound, within yon circle wide, Emania's palace, festive as a bride For centuries six, had found its wormy bed When here Saint Patrick raised his royal head And round him gazed. Perhaps the Apostle sighed Even then, to note the fall of mortal pride: Full fourteen hundred years since then have fled! Then, too, old Ulster's hundred kings were clay; Then, too, the Red Branch warriors slept forlorn; Autumn, perhaps as now a pilgrim grey, Counted her red beads on the berried thorn, Making her rounds; while from the daisied sod The undiscountenanced lark upsoared, and praised her God. XXX. DUNLUCE CASTLE, COUNTY OF ANTRIM. O! of the fallen, most fallen, yet of the proud Proudest; sole-seated on thy tower-girt rock; Breasting for ever reboant ocean's shock; With blind sea-caves for ever dinned and loud; Now sunset-gilt; now wrapt in vapoury shroud Till distant ships—so well thy bastions mock Primeval nature's style in joint and block— Misdeem her ramparts, round thee bent and bowed, For thine, and on her walls, men say, have hurled The red artillery store designed for thee: Thy wars are done! Henceforth perpetually Thou restest, like some judged, impassive world Whose sons, their probatory period past, Have left that planet void amid the vast. XXXI. HORN HEAD, COUNTY OF DONEGAL. Sister of Earth, her sister eldest-born, Huge world of waters, how unlike are ye! Thy thoughts are not as her thoughts: unto thee Her pastoral fancies are as things to scorn: Thy heart is still with that old hoary morn When on the formless deep, the procreant sea, God moved alone: of that Infinity, Thy portion then, thou art not wholly shorn. Scant love hast thou for dells where every leaf Boasts its own life, and every brook its song; Thy massive floods down stream from reef to reef With one wide pressure; thy worn cliffs along The one insatiate Hunger moans and raves, Hollowing its sunless crypts and sanguine caves. XXXII. FOUNTAINS ABBEY. The hand of Time is heavy; yet how soft Its touch can be, yon mouldering chancel knows! The ruin too can ‘blossom like the rose;’ Nor e'er from orchard bower, or garth, or croft, More sweetly sang the linnet than aloft She sings from that green tower! The sunset glows Behind it; and yon stream that, darkling, flows From arch to arch, reflects it oft and oft, Humbly consenting 'mid the gloom to smile And take what pensive gladness may befall: Rejoice thou, too, O venerable Pile, With loftier heart answering a holier call: Like those, thy buried saints, make strong thy trust, Waiting the Resurrection of the Just. XXXIII. ON READING AN UNTRUE CHARGE. Beautiful Land! They said, ‘He loves thee not!’ But in a churchyard 'mid thy meadows lie The bones of no disloyal ancestry To whom in me disloyal were the thought Which wronged thee. For my youth thy Shakspeare wrought; For me thy minsters raised their towers on high; Thou gav'st me friends whose memory cannot die:— I love thee, and for that cause left unsought Thy praise. Thy ruined cloisters, forests green, Thy moors where still the branching wild deer roves, Dear haunts of mine by sun and moon have been From Cumbrian peaks to Devon's laughing coves. They love thee less, fair Land, who ne'er had heart To take, for truth's sake, 'gainst thyself thy part. ON VISITING A HAUNT OF COLERIDGE'S. From Lynton, where the double streams Through forest-hung ravines made way, And bounded into seas late grey That shook with morning's earliest beams, I wandered on to Porlock bay; And thence, for love of him who sang His happiest songs beside their rills, To ‘seaward Quantock's heathy hills’ See Coleridge's ‘Recollections of Love.’ Advanced, while lane and hedge-grove rang, And all the song-birds ‘had their wills.’ There, like a sweet face dimmed with pain, The scene grew dark with mist and shower: Its yellow leaf the autumnal bower Moulted full fast; and as the rain Washed the last fragrance from the flower I heard the blue-robed schoolboy's tongue Thrilling Christ's Hospital once more With mythic chant and antique lore, While round their Bard his playmates hung, Wondering, and sighed, the witchery o'er. I saw him tread soft Devon's coombes— Ah! thence he drew that southern grace Which in his songs held happy place Amid their mystic northland glooms, Like some strange flower of alien race;— That Bard who like a gleam, or strain Of music, crossed at morn and eve Those hills; who sang of Genevieve And that weird Pilgrim from the main; Nor less at Truth's command could leave Song's sheltered haunt the steeps to climb Where, high o'er cloud and precipice, Mind, throned among the seas of ice, Watches from specular tower sublime Far visions kenned through freezing skies, Outlines of Thought, like hills through mist That stretch athwart the Infinite In dread mathesis lines of light— Such Thoughts the Muse's spell resist; Above her mark they wing their flight! The songs he gave us, what were they But preludes to some loftier rhyme That would not leave the spheral chime, The concords of eternal day, And speak itself in words of Time? O ever-famished Heart! O hands That still ‘drew nectar in a sieve!’ At birth of thine what witch had leave To bind such strength in willow bands, The web half-woven still to unweave? O for those Orphic songs unheard That lived but in the Singer's thought! Who sinned? Whose hand frustration wrought? Unworthy was the world or Bard To clasp those Splendours all but caught? What Bard of all who e'er have sung Since that lark sang when Eve had birth, Song's inmost soul had attered forth Like thee? from Song's asperge had flung Her lesser baptism o'er the earth? The world's base Poets have not kept Song's vigil on her vestal height, Nor scorned false pride and foul delight, Nor with the weepers rightly wept, Nor seen God's visions in the night! Profane to enthrone the Sense, and add A gleam that lies to shapes that pass, Ah me! in song as in a glass They might have shown us glory-clad His Face Who ever is and was! They might have shown us cloud and leaf Lit with the radiance uncreate; Love, throned o'er vanquished Lust and Hate; Joy, gem-distilled through rocks of Grief; And Justice conquering Time and Fate! But they immodest brows have crowned With violated bud and flower: Courting the high Muse ‘par amour,’ Upon her suppliants she hath frowned, And sent them darkness for a dower. Better half-sight and tear-dimmed day Than dust-defiled, o'er-sated Touch! Better the torn wing than the crutch! Better who hide their gift than they Who give so basely and so much! Thy song was pure: thy heart was high: Thy genius through its strength was chaste: And if that genius ran to waste, Unblemished as its native sky O'er diamond rocks the river raced! Great Bard! To thee in youth my heart Rushed as the maiden's to the boy, When love, too blithesome to be coy, No want forebodes and feels no smart, A selfless love self-brimmed with joy! Still sporting with those amaranth leaves That shape for others coronals, I ask not on whose head it falls That crown the Fame Pandemian weaves— Thee, thee the Fame Uranian calls! For wildered feet point thou the path Which mounts to where triumphant sit The Assumed of Earth, all human yet, From sun-glare safe and tempest's wrath, Who sing for love; nor those forget, The Elders crowned that, singing, fling Their crowns upon the Temple floor; Those Elders ever young, though hoar, Who count all praise an idle thing Save His who lives for evermore! LINES TO AN OLD LARCH-TREE AT CURRAGH CHASE. What secret charm hath bound me to this spot Thus long? All-beauteous canopy of boughs That hang'st on air suspense, the spell is thine! A cloud thou seem'dst, condensed into a tree, Yet keeping somewhat of its cloud-like softness, When seen at distance; nearer as I draw, Thou seem'st a billowy sea, with such a grace Those undulant limbs on ether swell and bask, Now surgent, sinking now. A Greek had deemed That 'mid the innocuous tempest round thee stayed, Thy blissful playmate thine unshared possession, For in it scarce yon tapering cypress sways, 'Mid all that rich and exquisite confusion The Nereids, and the Nephelìad race, Forsaking azure waves and sailing rack, Were sporting with thy Dryads! Nearer yet I draw to thee, and nearer. Is it joy That brightens thus thy mien? The groves that fence This pleasaunce, youthful when with thee compared Are dark with thee contrasted! Old thou art; Thy trunk is old; but every year those sprays, Waving dependent in the golden gleam— In them thy seat of gladness dwells—are young As in thine earliest April. Laughs from out them The crystal clearness of that green unknown Save to thy race at springtide; laughs in light; Laughs like the emerald brine, that, glimpsed far off, Ascends those “Diamond Rocks” of famed Kilkee! Yet, where the evening shade has reached thy branches, O'er them, in place of simple joy, there spreads That pathos seen alone upon a face Where joy with sadness mingles. Vision-tranced Thy countless boughs stretch forth, pointing one way, Eastward, still eastward. Eastward, too, that stem, Bent by sea-scented gales of many a year, Inclines for aye; those gales that o'er thy brow, So gracious are the adversities of Time, Have wov'n that softly-stormy crown of boughs, And changed the strength aspiring of thy kind To humbler, tenderer grace. The sun descends, Screened by the western slopes; and, far below, Creeping from foot to knee, from knee to breast, The shadow slowly mounts those woods remote Girdling yon lake there where that keep-like Rock Gleams in its glass—those woods whose crest still bright Must soon in turn be darksome. Ancient Tree, That from thine eminence on them look'st down, Dost thou, prescient like them of coming night, Forecast the dawn beyond it as the Just Discern beyond death's cloud their heaven? 'Tis so! Once more I see that forehead eastward bowed; I see thee stretching forth once more thy hands In eastward adoration; and, with sighs Unutterable, and yearnings ne'er to cease, Courting the embrace of some perpetual morn; I see, and half believe, that when that sun, Now sunk, anon uprising full in face O'er Galtymore—ah, me! how oft the eyes Of Spenser must have kenned its southern steeps, How oft my Father's watched it from the west!— Levels his beam against thy dewy lips, Memnonian melodies will breathe response. April 27, 1883. AUTUMNAL ODE. DEDICATED TO MY SISTER. CURRAGH CHASE, OCTOBER, 1867. I. Minstrel and Genius, to whose songs or sighs The round earth modulates her changeful sphere, That bend'st in shadow from yon western skies, And lean'st, cloud-hid, along the woodlands sere, Too deep thy notes too pure for mortal ear! Yet Nature hears them: without aid of thine How sad were her decline! From thee she learns with just and soft gradation Her dying hues in death to harmonize; Through thee her obsequies A glory wear that conquers desolation. Through thee she singeth, ‘Faithless were the sighing Breathed o'er a beauty only born to fleet: A holy thing and precious is the dying Of that whose life was innocent and sweet.’ From many a dim retreat Lodged on high-bosomed, echoing mountain lawn, Or chiming convent 'mid dark vale withdrawn, From cloudy shrine or rapt oracular seat Voices of loftier worlds that saintly strain repeat. II. It is the Autumnal Epode of the year: The Nymphs that urge the seasons on their round, They to whose green lap flies the startled deer When bays the far-off hound, They that drag April by the rain-bright hair, Though sun-showers daze her and the rude winds scare, O'er March's frosty bound, They by whose warm and furtive hand unwound The cestus falls from May's new-wedded breast, Silent they stand beside dead Summer's bier, With folded palms, and faces to the West, And their loose tresses sweep the dewy ground. III. A sacred stillness hangs upon the air, A sacred clearness. Distant shapes draw nigh: Glistens yon Elm grove, to its heart laid bare, And all articulate in its symmetry, With here and there a branch that from on high Far flashes washed in wan and watery gleam: Beyond, the glossy lake lies calm—a beam Upheaved, as if in sleep, from its slow central stream. IV. This quiet, is it Truth, or some fair mask? Is pain no more? Shall Sleep be lord, not Death? Shall sickness cease to afflict and overtask The spent and labouring breath? Is there 'mid all yon farms and fields, this day, No grey old head that drops? No darkening eye? Spirits of Pity, lift your hands and pray— Each hour, alas, men die! V. The love songs of the Blackbird now are done: Upon the o'er-grown, loose, red-berried cover The latest of late warblers sings as one That trolls at random when the feast is over: From bush to bush the dusk-bright cobwebs hover, Silvering the dried-up rill's exhausted urn; No breeze is fluting o'er the green morass: Nor falls the thistle-down: in deep-drenched grass, Now blue now red the shifting dew-gems burn. VI. Mine ear thus torpid held, methinks mine eye Is armed the more with visionary power: As with a magnet's force each redd'ning bower Compels me through the woodland pageantry: Slowly I track the forest's skirt: emerging, Slowly I climb from pastoral steep to steep: I see far mists from reedy valleys surging: I follow the procession of white sheep That fringe with wool old stock and ruined rath, How staid to-day, how eager when the lambs Went bleating round their dams! I cross the leaf-choked stream from stone to stone, Pass the hoar ash-tree, trace the upland path, The furze-brake that in March all golden shone Reflected in the shy kingfisher's bath. VII. No more from full-leaved woods that music swells Which in the summer filled the satiate ear: A fostering sweetness still from bosky dells Murmurs; but I can hear A harsher sound when down, at intervals, The dry leaf rattling falls. Dark as those spots which herald swift disease The death-blot marks for death the leaf yet firm: Beside the leaf down-trodden trails the worm: In forest depths the haggard, whitening grass Repines at youth departed. Half-stripped trees Reveal, as one who says, ‘Thou too must pass,’ Plainlier each day their quaint anatomies. Yon Poplar grove is troubled! Bright and bold Babbled his cold leaves in the July breeze As though above our heads a runnel rolled: His mirth is o'er; subdued by old October He counts his lessening wealth, and, sadly sober, Tinkles his minute tablets of wan gold. VIII. Be still, ye sighs of the expiring year! A sword there is: ye play but with the sheath! Whispers there are more piercing yet more dear Than yours, that come to me those boughs beneath; And well-remembered footsteps known of old Tread soft the mildewed mould. O magic memory of the things that were: Of those whose hands our childish locks carest, Of one so angel-like in tender care, Of one in majesty so god-like drest; O phantom faces painted on the air Of friend or sudden guest:— I plead in vain: The woods revere, but cannot heal my pain: Ye sheddings from the Yew-tree and the Pine, If on your rich and aromatic dust I laid my forehead, and my hands put forth In the last beam that warms the forest floor, No answer to my yearnings would be mine; To me no answer through those branches hoar Would reach in noontide trance or moony gust! Her secret Heaven would keep, and mother Earth Speak from her deep heart—‘Where thou know'st not, trust!’ IX. That pang is past. Once more my pulses keep A tenor calm that knows nor grief nor joy; Once more I move as one that died in sleep, And treads, a Spirit, the haunts he trod, a boy, And sees them like-unlike, and sees beyond: Then earthly life comes back, and I despond. Ah life, not life! Dim woods of crimsoned beech That swathe the hills in sacerdotal stoles, Burn on, burn on! the year ere long will reach That day made holy to Departed Souls, That day whereon man's heart, itself a priest, Descending to that Empire pale wherein Beauty and Sorrow dwell but pure from Sin, Holds with God's Church at once its fast and feast. Dim woods, they, they alone your vaults should tread, The sad and saintly Dead! Your pathos those alone ungrieved could meet Who fit them for the Beatific Vision: The things which, as they pass us, seem to cheat To them would be a music-winged fruition, A cadence sweetest in its soft subsiding: Transience to them were dear;—for theirs the abiding— Dear as that Pain which clears from fleshly film The spirit's eye, matures each spirit-germ, Frost-bound on earth, but at the appointed term Mirror of Godhead in the immortal realm. X. Lo there the regal Exiles!—under shades Deeper than ours, yet in a finer air— Climbing, successive, elders, youths, and maids, The penitential mountain's ebon stair: The earth-shadow clips that halo round their hair: And as lone outcasts watch a moon that wanes Receding slowly o'er their native plains, Thus watch they, wistful, something far but fair. Serene they stand, and wait, Self-banished, by the ever-open gate, Awhile self-banished from the All-pitying Eyes, Lest mortal stain should blot their Paradise. Silent they pace, ascending high and higher The hills of God, a hand on every heart That willing burns, a vase of cleansing fire Fed by God's love in souls from God apart: Each lifted face with thirst of long desire Is pale; but o'er it grows a mystic sheen, Because on them God's face, by them unseen, Is turned, through narrowing darkness hourly nigher. XI. Sad thoughts, why roam ye thus in your unrest The bourne unseen? Why scorn our mortal bound? Is it not kindly, Earth's maternal breast? Is it not fair, her head with vine-wreaths crowned? Farm-yard and barn are heaped with golden store; High piled the sheaves illume the russet plain; Hedges and hedge-row trees are yellowed o'er With waifs and trophies of the labouring wain: Why murmur, ‘Change is change, when downward ranging; Spring's upward change but pointed to the unchanging?’ Yet, O how just your sorrow, if ye knew The true grief's sanction true! 'Tis not the thought of parting youth that moves us; 'Tis not alone the pang for friends departed: The Autumnal pain that raises while it proves us Wells from a holier source and deeper-hearted! For this a sadness swells above our mirth; For this a bitter runs beneath the sweetness; The throne that shakes not is the Spirit's right; The heart and hope of Man are infinite; Heaven is his home, and, exiled here on earth, Completion most betrays the incompleteness! XII. Heaven is his home.—But hark! the breeze increases: The sunset forests, catching sudden fire, Flash, swell, and sing, a million-organed choir: Roofing the West, rich clouds in glittering fleeces O'erarch ethereal spaces and divine Of heaven's clear hyaline. No dream is this! Beyond that radiance golden God's Sons I see, His armies bright and strong, The ensanguined Martyrs here with palms high holden, The virgins there, a lily-lifting throng! The Splendours nearer draw. In choral blending The Prophets' and the Apostles' chant I hear; I see the Salem of the Just descending With gates of pearl and diamond bastions sheer. The walls are agate and chalcedony: On jacinth street and jasper parapet The unwaning light is light of Deity, ‘Not beam of lessening moon or suns that set. That indeciduous forestry of spires Lets fall no leaf! those lights can never range: Saintly fruitions and divine desires Are blended there in rapture without change. —Man was not made for things that leave us, For that which goeth and returneth, For hopes that lift us yet deceive us, For love that wears a smile yet mourneth; Not for fresh forests from the dead leaves springing, The cyclic re-creation which, at best, Yields us—betrayal still to promise clinging— But tremulous shadows of the realm of rest: For things immortal Man was made, God's Image, latest from His hand, Co-heir with Him Who in Man's flesh arrayed Holds o'er the worlds the Heavenly-Human wand: His portion this—sublime To stand where access none hath Space or Time, Above the starry host, the Cherub band, To stand—to advance—and after all to stand!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. ‘The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.’ John i. 14. TO THE MEMORY OF CARDINAL MANNING This Poem IS DEDICATED WITH AFFECTION AND RESPECT 1881 PROLOGUE. Religion, she that stands sublime Upon the rock that crowns our globe, Her foot on all the spoils of time, With light eternal on her robe; She, sovereign of the orb she guides, On Truth's broad sun may root a gaze That deepens onward as she rides, And shrinks not from the fontal blaze: But they—her daughter Arts—must hide Within the cleft, content to see Dim skirts of glory waving wide And steps of parting Deity. 'Tis theirs to watch the Vision break In gleams from Nature's frown or smile The legend rise from out the lake The relic consecrate the isle. 'Tis theirs to adumbrate and suggest; To point toward founts of buried lore, Leaving, in type alone expressed, What Man must know not, yet adore. For where her court true Wisdom keeps, 'Mid loftier handmaids one there stands Dark as the midnight's starry deeps, A Slave, gem-crowned, from Nubia's sands— O thou whose light is in thy heart, Reverence, love's mother! without thee Science may soar awhile; but Art Drifts barren o'er a shoreless sea. MAY CAROLS. PART I. THE DIVINE CHILDHOOD. ‘I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed, and her seed.’—Gen. iii. 15. I. Who feels not, when the Spring once more, Stepping o'er Winter's grave forlorn With winged feet, retreads the shore Of widowed Earth, his bosom burn? As ordered flower succeeds to flower, And May the ladder of her sweets Ascends, advancing hour by hour From step to step, what heart but beats? Some Presence veiled in fields and groves That mingles rapture with remorse, Some buried joy beside us moves, And thrills the soul with such discourse As they, perchance, that wondering pair Who to Emmaus bent their way, Hearing, heard not. Like them our prayer We make:—‘The night is near us . . Stay!’ With Paschal chants the churches ring; Their echoes strike along the tombs; The birds their Hallelujahs sing; Each flower with nature's incense fumes. Our long-lost Eden seems restored— As on we move with tearful eyes We feel through all the illumined sward Some upward-working Paradise. II. Upon Thy Face, O God, Thy world Looks ever up in love and awe; Thy stars in circles onward hurled Sustain the steadying yoke of Law. In alternating antiphons Stream sings to stream and sea to sea; And moons that set and sinking suns Obeisance make, O God, to Thee. The swallow, winter's rage o'erblown, Again on warm Spring breezes borne Revisiteth her haunts well-known; The lark is faithful to the morn. The whirlwind, missioned with its wings To drown the fleet or fell the tower, Obeys Thee as the bird that sings Her love-chant in a fleeting shower. Amid an ordered universe Man's spirit only dares rebel:— With light, O God, its darkness pierce! With love its raging chaos quell! III. All but unutterable Name! Adorable, yet awful, sound! Thee can the sinful nations frame Save with their foreheads to the ground? Soul-searching and all-cleansing Fire! To see Thy Countenance were to die: Yet how beyond the bound retire Of Thy serene immensity? Thou mov'st beside us, if the spot We change, a noteless, wandering tribe: The planets of our Life and Thought In Thee their little arcs describe. In the dead calm, at cool of day, We hear Thy voice, and turn, and flee: Thy love outstrips us on our way: From Thee, O God, we fly—to Thee. IV. How came there Sin to world so fair, Where all things seem to bask in God, Where breathes His Love in every air, His life ascends from every sod? O happy birds and happy bees, And flowers that flash through matin gems! O happy trees, and happier breeze That sweep'st their dewy diadems! Why are not all things good and bright? Why are not all men kind and true? O World so beauteous, wise, and right, Your Maker is our Maker too! V. SANCTA MARIA. Mary! To thee the humble cry. What seek they? Gifts to pride unknown. They seek thy help—to pass thee by:— They murmur, ‘Show us but thy Son.’ The childlike heart shall enter in: The virgin soul its God shall see: Mother, and maiden pure from sin, Be thou the guide: the Way is He. The mystery high of God made Man Through thee to man is easier made: Pronounce the consonant who can Without the softer vowel's aid! VI. FEST. NATIVITATIS B. V. M. When thou wert born the murmuring world Rolled on, nor dreamed of things to be, From joy to sorrow madly whirled, Despair disguised in revelry. A princess thou of David's line; The mother of the Prince of Peace, That hour no royal pomps were thine: The earth alone her boon increase Before thee poured. September rolled Down all the vine-clad Syrian slopes Her robes of purple and of gold; And birds sang loud from olive tops. Perhaps old foes, they knew not why, Relented. From a fount long sealed Tears rose, perhaps, to Pity's eye: Love-harvests crowned the barren field. The respirations of the year, At least, grew soft. O'er valleys wide Pine-roughened crags again shone clear; And the great Temple, far descried, To watchers, watching long in vain, To patriots grey, in bondage nursed, Flashed back their hope—‘The Second Fane In glory shall surpass the First!’ VII. AB ANGELO SALUTATA. That angel's voice is in her ear! Ah, not alone by Mary heard! Like light it cleaves that region drear Where never sang the matin bird! It thrills the expectant Hades! They, The pair that once through Eden ranged, Amid their penal shadows grey Stand up and smile, this hour avenged! They see their queenly daughter grasp The Fruit of Life, her bridal dower: They see its boughs rush up, and clasp The sleeping earth with starry bower. Once more they tread that Eden bound: Far up—all round—at last, at last They see God's mountain city-crowned; In every fount they see it glassed. Why saw they not, the hour they fell, Those hills, that City ‘like a Bride’? Then too it girt that garden dell, Predestined Heaven though undescried! VIII. NIHIL RESPONDIT. She hid her face from Joseph's blame The Spirit's glory-shrouded Bride: The sword comes next; but first the shame: Meekly she bore it; nought replied. In mutual sympathies we live: The insulted heart forgives, but dies: To her that wound was sanative For life to her was sacrifice. At us no barbless shaft is thrown When charged with deeds by us unwrought; For sins unchallenged, sins unknown, Worse sins have stained us, act, or thought. Her humbleness no sin could find To weep for: yet, that hour, no less Deeplier the habitual sense was shrined In her of her own nothingness. That hour foundations deeper yet God sank in her; that so more high Her greatness, spire and parapet, Might rise and nearer to the sky; That, wholly over-built by grace, Nature might vanish, like some isle In great towers lost—the buried base Of some surpassing fortress pile. IX. ST. JOSEPH'S DOUBT. ‘The Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream.’ 'Twas not her tear his doubt subdued; No word of hers announced her Christ: By him in dream that angel stood With warning hand. A dream sufficed. Where faith is strong, though light be dim, How faint a beam reveals how much! The Hand that made the worlds on him Descended with a feather's touch. ‘Blessèd for ever who believed:’— Like Her, through faith his crown he won: His heart the Babe divine conceived; His heart was sire of Mary's Son. Hail, Image of the Father's Might! The Heavenly Father's human shade! Hail, silent King whose yoke was light! Hail, Foster-sire whom Christ obeyed! Hail, Warder of God's Church beneath, Thy vigil keeping at her door Year after year at Nazareth! So guard, so guide it evermore! X. FEST. VISITATIONIS. The hilly region crossed with haste, Its last dark ridge discerned no more, Bright as the bow that spans a waste She stood beside her Cousin's door; And spake:—that greeting came from God! Filled with the Spirit from on high Sublime the aged Mother stood, And cried aloud in prophecy, ‘Soon as thy voice had touched mine ears The child in childless age conceived, Leaped up for joy! Throughout all years Blessed the Woman who believed.’ Type of Electing Love! 'tis thine To sound God's greeting from the skies! Thou speak'st, and Faith, a babe divine, Leaps up thy Babe to recognise. Within true hearts the second birth Exults, though blind as yet and dumb. The child of Grace his hands puts forth, And prophesies of things to come. XI. AMOR INNOCENTIUM. Ascending from the convent-grates, The children mount the woodland vale. 'Tis May-Day Eve; and Hesper waits To light them, while the western gale Blows softly on their bannered line: And, lo! down all the mountain stairs The shepherd children come to join The convent children at their prayers. They meet before Our Lady's fane: On yonder central rock it stands, Uplifting, ne'er invoked in vain, That Cross which blesses all the lands. Before the porch the flowers are flung; The lamp hangs glittering 'neath the Rood; The ‘Maris Stella’ hymn is sung; Their chant each morn to be renewed. Ah! if a secular muse might dare, Far off, the children's song to catch; To echo back, or burthen bear!— As fitly might she hope to match The throstle's note as theirs, 'tis true: Yet, now and then, that borrowed tone, Like sunbeams flashed on pine or yew Might shoot a sweetness through her own! XII. FEST. NATIVITATIS. Primeval night had repossessed Her empire in the fields of space; Calm lay the kine on earth's dark breast; The earth lay calm in heaven's embrace. That hour, where shepherds kept their flocks, From God a glory sudden fell: The splendour smote the trees and rocks, And lay, like dew, along the dell. God's Angel close beside them stood: ‘Fear nought,’ that Angel said, and then, ‘Behold, I bring you tidings good: The Saviour Christ is born to men.’ And straightway round him myriads sang Again that anthem, and again, Till all the hollow valley rang, ‘Glory to God, and peace to men.’ Thus in the violet-scented grove, The May breeze murmuring softly by them, The children sang. Who Mary love The long year through have Christmas nigh them! XIII. PROTEVANGELION. When from their lurking place the Voice Of God dragged forth that Fallen Pair Still seemed the garden to rejoice, The sinless Eden still was fair. They, they alone, whose light of grace But late made Paradise look dim Stood now, a blot upon its face, Before their God, nor gazed on Him. They glanced not up; or they had seen In that severe, death-dooming eye Unutterable depths serene Of sadly-piercing sympathy. Not them alone that Eye beheld, But, by their side, that other Twain In whom the race whose doom was knelled Once more should rise; once more should reign. It saw that Infant crowned with blood— And her from whose predestined breast That Infant ruled the worlds. She stood Her foot upon the serpent's crest! Voice of primeval prophecy! Of all the Gospels head and heart! With Him, her Son and Saviour, she Possessed, that hour, in thee a part! XIV. DEI GENITRIX. I see Him: on thy lap He lies 'Mid that Judæan stable's gloom: O sweet, O awful Sacrifice! He smiles in sleep, yet knows the doom. Thou gav'st Him life! But was not this That Life which knows no parting breath! Unmeasured Life? unwaning Bliss? Dread Priestess, lo! thou gav'st Him death! Beneath the Tree thy Mother stood; Beneath the Cross thou too shalt stand:— O Tree of Life! O bleeding Rood! Thy shadow stretches far its hand. That God who made the sun and moon In swaddling bands lies dumb and bound— Love's Captive! darker prison soon Awaits Thee in the garden ground. He wakens. Paradise looks forth Beyond the portals of the grave. Life, life thou gavest! life to Earth, Not Him! Thine Infant dies to save. XV. ADOLESCENTULÆ AMAVERUNT TE NIMIS. ‘Behold! the wintry rains are past; The airs of midnight hurt no more: The young maids love thee. Come at last! Thou lingerest at the garden-door. `Blow over all the garden; blow, Thou wind that breathest of the south Through all the alleys winding low With dewy wing and honeyed mouth! ‘But wheresoe'er thou wanderest, shape Thy music ever to one Name: Thou too, clear stream, to cave and cape Be sure thou whisper of the same. ‘By every isle and bower of musk Thy crystal clasps as on it curls We charge thee, breathe it to the dusk; We charge thee, grave it in thy pearls.’ The stream obeyed. That Name he bore Far out above the moon-lit tide: The breeze obeyed. He breathed it o'er The unforgetting Pine; and died. XVI. The infant year with infant freak Intent to dazzle and surprise, Played with us long at hide and seek, Turned on us now, now veiled her eyes. Between the pines for ever green And boughs by April half attired She glanced; then sang, once more unseen, ‘The unbeheld is more desired.’ With footsteps vague, and hard to trace, She crept from whitening bower to bower; Now bent from heaven her golden face Now veiled her radiance in a shower. Like genial hopes and thoughts devout That touch some sceptic soul forlorn, And herald clearer faith, and rout The night, and antedate the morn, Her gifts. But thou, all-beauteous May, Art come at last. O! with thee bring Hearts pure as thine with thee to play, And own the consummated spring. To hands by deeds unblest defiled In vain the whiteness of thy thorn! Proud souls, where lurks no more the child. For them thy violet is unborn! For breasts that know nor joy nor hope Thy songstress sings an idle strain: Thy golden-domed laburnums drop O'er loveless hearts their bowers in vain. XVII. FEST. EPIPHANIÆ. A veil is on the face of Truth: She prophesies behind a cloud; She ministers in robes of ruth Nocturnal rites and disallowed. Eleusis hints, but dares not speak; The Orphic minstrelsies are dumb; Lost are the Sibyl's books, and weak Earth's olden faith in Him to come. But ah, but ah, that Orient Star! On straw-roofed shed and large-eyed kine It flashes, guiding from afar The Magians' long-linked camel-line! Gold, frankincense, and myrrh they bring— Love, Worship, Life severe and hard: Their symbol gifts the Infant King Accepts; and Truth is their reward. Rejoice, O Sion, for thy night Is past: the Lord, thy Light, is born: The Gentiles shall behold thy light; The kings walk forward in thy morn. XVIII. FEST. EPIPHANIÆ. They leave the land of gems and gold, The shining portals of the East; For Him, ‘the Woman's Seed’ foretold, They leave the revel and the feast. To earth their sceptres they have cast And crowns by Kings ancestral worn; They track the lonely Syrian waste; They kneel before the Babe new-born. O happy eyes that saw Him first! O happy lips that kissed His feet! Earth slakes at last her ancient thirst; With Eden's joy her pulses beat. True Kings are those who thus forsake Their kingdoms for the Eternal King— Serpent! her foot is on thy neck! Herod! thou writh'st, but canst not sting! He, He is King, and He alone, Who lifts that Infant hand to bless; Who makes His Mother's knee His Throne, Yet rules the starry wilderness. XIX. MATER DEI. How many a lonely hermit-maid Hath brightened like a dawn-touched isle When, on her breast in vision laid, That Babe hath lit her with His smile! How many an agèd Saint hath felt, So graced, a second spring renew Her wintry breast; with Anna knelt And trembled like the matin dew! How oft th' unbending monk, no thrall In youth of mortal smiles or tears, Hath felt that Infant's touch through all The armour of his hundred years! But Mary's was no transient bliss; Nor hers a vision's phantom gleam: The hourly need, the voice, the kiss— That Child was hers! 'twas not a dream! At morning hers, and when the sheen Of moonrise crept the cliffs along; In silence hers, and hers between The pulses of the night-bird's song. And as the Child, the love. Its growth Was, hour by hour, a growth in grace: That Child was God; and love for both Advanced perforce with equal pace. XX. GAUDIUM ANGELORUM. ‘He looked on her humility’— Ah humbler thrice that breast was made When Jesus watched His mother's eye, When God each God-born wish obeyed! In her with seraph seraph strove And each the other's purpose crost: And now 'twas Reverence, now 'twas Love The peaceful strife that won or lost. Now to that Infant she extends Those hands that mutely say ‘mine own!’ Now shrinks abashed, or swerves and bends As bends a willow backward blown. And ofttimes, like a roseleaf caught By eddying airs from fairy land, The kiss a sleeping brow that sought Descends upon the unsceptred hand! O tenderest awe whose sweet excess Had ended in a fond despair Had not the all-pitying helplessness Constrained the boldness of her care! O holiest strife! The angelic hosts That watched it hid their dazzled eyes, And lingered from the heavenly coasts To bless that heavenlier Paradise! XXI. LEGENDA. O wearied Souls, by earth beguiled, Round whom the world's enthralments close Look back on her, that three-years' child, Who first the life conventual chose! A nun-like veil was o'er her thrown, Her locks by fillet-bands made fast, Swiftly she climbed the steps of stone; Into the Temple swiftly passed. Not once she paused her breath to take; Not once cast back a homeward look: As longs the hart his thirst to slake When noontide rages, in the brook, So longed that child to live for God; So pined from earth's enthralments free, To bathe her wholly in the flood Of God's abysmal purity! Anna and Joachim from far Their eyes on that white vision raised; And when, like caverned foam, or star Cloud-hid, she vanished, still they gazed. XXII. FEST. PRESENTATIONIS. Twelve years had passed, and, still a child In brightness of the unblemished face, Once more she scaled those steps, and smiled On Him who slept in her embrace. As in she passed there fell a calm On all: each bosom slowly rose Like the long branches of the palm When under them the south wind blows: The scribe forgot his wordy lore; The chanted psalm was heard far off; Hushed was the clash of golden ore; And hushed the Sadducean scoff. Type of the Church, the gift was thine! 'Twas thine to offer first, that hour, Thy Son—the Sacrifice Divine, The Church's everlasting dower! Great Priestess! round that aureoled brow Which cloud or shadow ne'er had crossed, Began there not thenceforth to grow A milder dawn of Pentecost? XXIII. THE FIRST DOLOUR. (Gladio Transfixa.) To be the mother of her Lord— What means it? This; a bleeding heart! The pang that woke at Simeon's word Worked inward, never to depart. The dreadful might of Sin she knew As Innocence alone can know: O'er her its deadliest gloom it threw As shades lie darkest on the snow. Yet o'er her Sorrow's depth no storm Of earth's rebellious passion rolled: So sleeps some lake no gusts deform High on the dark hills' craggy fold. In that still glass the unmeasured cliff, With all its scars and clouds is shown: And, mellowed in that mother's grief, At times, O Christ, we catch Thine own! XXIV. The golden rains are dashed against Those verdant walls of lime and beech Wherewith our happy vale is fenced Against the north; yet cannot reach The stems that lift yon leafy crest High up above their dripping screen: The chestnut fans are downward pressed On banks of bluebell hid in green. White vapours float along the glen Or rise from every sunny brake; A pause amid the gusts—again The warm shower sings across the lake. Sing on, all-cordial showers, and bathe The deepest root of loftiest pine! The cowslip dim, the ‘primrose rathe’ Refresh; and drench in nectarous wine Yon fruit-tree copse, all blossomed o'er With forest-foam and crimsoned snow— Behold! above it bursts once more The world-embracing, heavenly bow! XXV. LEGENDA. As, flying Herod, southward went That Child and Mother, unamazed, Into Egyptian banishment, The weeders left their work, and gazed. That bright One spake to them, and said, ‘When Herod's messengers demand, Passed not that Infant, Herod's dread,— Passed not that Infant through your land? ‘Then shall ye answer make, and say, Behold, since first the corn was green No little Infant passed this way; No little Infant we have seen.’ Earth heard; nor missed the Maid's intent— As on the Flower of Eden passed With Eden swiftness up she sent A sun-browned harvest ripening fast. By simplest words and sinless wheat The messengers rode back beguiled; And by that truthfullest deceit Which saved the little new-born Child! XXVI. THE SECOND DOLOUR.(Cum Filio Profuga.) The fruitful River slides along; The Conqueror's City glitters nigh; The Palm-groves ring with dance and song; Earth trembles, crimsoned from the sky. Far down the sunset, lonely stands Some temple of a bygone age Slow-settling into sea-like sands, Long served with prayer and pilgrimage. Here ruled the Shepherd-Kings, and they That race from Sun and Moon which drew The unending lines of Priestly sway: Here Alexander's standard flew. Here last the great Cæsarian star Through Egypt's sunset flashed its beam While pealed the Roman trump afar, And Earth's first Empire like a dream Dissolved. But who are they—the Three That pierce thus late yon desert wide? The Babe is on His Mother's knee; Low-bent an old Man walks beside. What say'st thou, Egypt? ‘Let them come! Of such as little note I keep As of the least of flies that hum Above my deserts, or my deep!’ XXVII. SAINT JOSEPH. True Prince of David's line! thy chair Is set on every poor man's floor: Labour through thee a crown doth wear More rich than kingly crowns of yore! True Confessor! thine every deed, While error ruled the world, or night Confessed aright the Christian creed, The Christian warfare waged aright. Teach us, like thee, our heart to raise, In toil not ease contemplatist; Like thee, o'er lowly tasks to gaze On her whose eyes are still on Christ. O teach us, thou whose ebbing breath Was watched by Mary and her Son, To welcome age, await in death True life's true garland, justly won. XXVIII. ‘JOSEPH, HER HUSBAND.’ Gladsome and pure was Eden's bower— Saint Joseph's house was holier far, More rich in Love's auguster dower, More amply lit by Wisdom's star. The Queen of Virgins where he sate Beside him stood and watched his hand: His daughter-wife, his angel-mate Submissive to his least command. Hail, Patriarch blest and sage! on earth Thine was the bridal of the skies! Thy house was heaven: for by its hearth Thy God reposed in mortal guise. Hail! life most sweet in life's decline! Hail death, than life more bright, more blest! The hands of Mary clasping thine, Thy head upon the Saviour's breast! XXIX. SAINT JOSEPH'S PATRONAGE.(‘Constituit eum dominum domus suæ.’ The Household Saints.) The Apostle's life, the Martyr's death, The all-conquering Word, all-wondrous Sign, Have greatness sense-discerned. By faith, And Faith's strong Love, we reach to thine. Through lower heavens those others run, Fair planets kenned by feebler eyes: Thy loftier light is later won, Serener gleam from lonelier skies. Thou stand'st within: they move without: More near the God-Man was thy place: It was: it is: we cannot doubt That as thy greatness was thy grace. No priestly tiar, no prophet rod Were thine: with them thou art who zone The altar of Incarnate God, Who throng the white steps of the Throne. There Anna rests, and Joachim That Great One's Parents; at their side Elizabeth, not far from Him Her Baptist Son for Right who died. A hierarchy apart they sit, A Royal House benign yet dread, In Godhead veiled, by Godhead lit— There highest shines thy silver head. XXX. MATER CHRISTI. Daily beneath His mother's eyes Her Lamb matured His lowliness; 'Twas hers the lovely Sacrifice With fillet and with flower to dress. Beside that mother's knee He knelt; With heavenly-human lips He prayed: His Will within her will she felt; And yet His Will her will obeyed. Gethsemané! when day is done Thy flowers with falling dews are wet: Her tears fell never; for the sun Those tears that brightened never set. The house was silent as that shrine The priest but entered once a year: There shone His emblem. Light Divine! Thy presence and Thy power were here! XXXI. MATER CHRISTI. He willed to lack; He willed to bear; He willed by suffering to be schooled; He willed the chains of flesh to wear; Yet from her arms the worlds He ruled. As tapers 'mid the noontide glow With merged yet separate radiance burn, With human taste and touch even so The things He knew He willed to learn. He sat beside the lowly door: His homeless eyes appeared to trace In evening skies remembered lore And shadows of His Father's face. One only knew Him. She alone Who nightly to His cradle crept And, lying like the moonbeam prone, Worshipped her Maker as He slept. XXXII. MATER CREATORIS. Bud forth a Saviour, Earth! fulfil Thy first of functions, ever new! Balm-dropping heaven, for aye distil Thy grace like manna or like dew! ‘To us, this day, a Child is born.’ Heaven knows not mere historic facts— Celestial mysteries night and morn Live on in ever-present Acts. Calvary's dread Victim in the skies On God's great altar rests even now: The Pentecostal glory lies For ever round the Church's brow. From Son and Father, He, the Lord Of Love and Life, proceeds alway: Upon the first Creative Word Creation, trembling, hangs for aye. Nor less ineffably renewed Than when on earth the tie began, Is that mysterious Motherhood Which re-creates the worlds and man. XXXIII. MATER SALVATORIS. O Heart with His in just accord! O Soul His echo, tone for tone! O Spirit that heard and kept His word! O Countenance moulded like His Own! Behold, she seemed on Earth to dwell; But hid in light she ever sat Beneath the Throne ineffable Chanting her clear Magnificat. Fed from the boundless heart of God The joy within her rose more high And all her being overflowed, Until that Hour decreed drew nigh. That hour, there crept her spirit o'er The shadow of that pain world-wide Whereof her Son the substance bore— Him offering, half in Him she died; Standing, like that strange Moon whereon The mask of Earth lies dim and dead, An orb of glory, shadow-strewn, Yet girdled with a luminous thread. XXXIV. HER FOUNDATIONS ARE ON THE HOLY HILLS. Her Child, her God, in Nature's right She loved: we love Him but by Grace: Behold! our Virtue's proudest height Is lower than her Virtue's base! Alone by holy Nature taught All lesser mothers love their own: Her love was Nature's love, heaven-caught, And lightning-lifted to the Throne. Her God! alone through worship she Proportioned love for Him could prove! Her God, and yet her Offspring! He Both loved her, and was bound to love! XXXV. MATER ADMIRABILIS. O Mother-maid! to none save thee Belongs in full a Parent's name; So fruitful thy Virginity, Thy Motherhood so pure from blame! All other parents, what are they? Thy types! In them thou stood'st rehearsed As they in bird, and bud, and spray. Thine Antitype? The Eternal First! Prime Parent He: and next Him thou! O'ershadowed by the Father's Might Thy ‘Fiat’ was thy bridal vow: Thine offspring He, the ‘Light from Light.’ Her Son Thou wert: her Son Thou art O Christ! Her substance fed Thy growth: Alone, she shaped Thee in her heart— Thy Mother and Thy Father both. XXXVI. MATER AMABILIS. Mother of Love! Thy love to Him Cherub and Seraph can but guess: A mother sees its image dim In her own breathless tenderness. That infant touch none else could feel Vibrates like light through all her sense: Far off she hears his cry: her zeal With lions fights in his defence. Unmarked his youth goes by: his hair Still smooths she down, still strokes apart; The first white thread that meets her there Glides like a dagger through her heart. Men praise him: on her matron cheek There dawns once more a maiden red: Of war, of battle-fields they speak: She sees once more his father dead. In sickness—half in sleep—she hears His foot, ere yet that foot is nigh: Wakes with a smile; and scarcely fears If he but clasp her hand, to die. XXXVII. THE THIRD DOLOUR.(Filium quærens.) Three days she seeks her Child in vain: He who vouchsafed that holy woe And makes the gates of glory pain He, He alone its depth can know. She wears the garment He must wear; She tastes His chalice! From a Cross Unseen she cries, ‘Where art Thou, where? Why hast Thou me forsaken thus?’ With feebler hand she touches first That sharpest thorn in all His Crown, Worse than the Nails, the Reed, the Thirst, Seeming Desertion's icy frown! O Saviour! we, the weak, the blind We lose Thee, snared in Pleasure's bound: Teach us once more Thy Face to find Where only Thou art truly found, In Thy true Church, its Faith, its Love Its anthemed Rites or Penance mute And that Interior Life whereof Eternal Life is flower and fruit. XXXVIII. MATER FILII. Others, the hours of youth gone by, A mother's hearth and home forsake; And, with the need, the filial tie Relaxes, though it does not break. But Thou wert born to be a Son— God's Son in heaven, Thy will was this, To pass the chain of Sonship on And bind in one whatever is. Thou cam'st the Son of Man to be, That so Thy brethren too might bear Adoptive Sonship, and with Thee Thy Sire's eternal kingdom share. Transcendently the Son Thou art: In this mysterious bond entwine, As in a single, two-celled heart, Thy natures, human and divine. XXXIX. When April's sudden sunset cold Through half-clothed boughs with watery sheen Bursts on the high, new-cowslipped wold And bathes a world half gold half green Then shakes the illuminated air With din of birds; the vales far down Grow phosphorescent here and there; Forth flash the turrets of the town; Along the sky thin vapours scud; Bright zephyrs curl the choral main; The wild ebullience of the blood Rings joy-bells in the heart and brain: Yet in that music discords mix; The unbalanced lights like meteors play; And, tired of splendours that perplex, The dazzled spirit sighs for May. XL. Not yet, not yet! the Season sings Not of fruition yet but hope; Still holds aloft, like balanced wings Her scales, and lets not either drop. The white ash, last year's skeleton, Still glares uncheered by leaf or shoot 'Gainst azure heavens, and joy hath none In that pure primrose at her foot. Yet Nature's virginal suspense Is not forgetfulness nor sloth: Where'er we wander soul and sense Discern a blindly working growth. Her throne once more the daisy takes That white star of our dusky earth; And the sky-cloistered lark down-shakes Her passion of seraphic mirth. 'Twixt barren hills and clear cold skies She weaves, ascending high and higher, Songs florid as those traceries Which won their name of old from fire. Sing! thou that need'st no ardent clime To sun the sweetness from thy breast And teach us those delights sublime Wherein ascetic spirits rest! XLI. The moon, ascending o'er a mass Of tangled yew and sable pine, What sees she in yon watery glass? A tearful countenance divine. Far down, the winding hills between, A sea of vapour bends for miles, Unmoving. Here and there dim-seen The knolls above it rise like isles. The tall rock glimmers spectre-white; The cedar in its sleep is stirred; At times the bat divides the night; At times the far-off flood is heard. Above, that shining blue!—below, That shining mist! Oh, not more pure Midwinter's landscape, robed in snow And fringed with frosty garniture! The fragrance of the advancing year Alone assures us it is May. Make answer! in the heavenlier sphere Must all of earth have passed away? XLII. NAZARETH. Before the Saviour's eyes unscaled The Beatific Vision stood— If God from her that splendour veiled A while, in Him she gazed on God. The Eternal Spirit o'er them hung: The Eternal Father moved beside: With hands forth-held the Angelic throng Worshipped their Maker far descried. Yet neither He who said of yore ‘Let there be light’—and all was day— Nor she that, still a creature, wore, Creation's crown, and wears for aye, To casual gazers wondrous seemed: The wanderer sat beside their door, Partook their broken bread, and deemed The donors kindly; nothing more. In Eden thus that primal Pair Ere sin had marred their first estate Sate side by side in silent prayer, Their earliest sunset fronting, sate; And now the lion now the pard Piercing the Cassia bower drew nigh; Fixed on the twain a mute regard, Half pleased, half vacant; then passed by. XLIII. FŒDERIS ARCA. From end to end, O God, Thy Will With swift yet ordered might doth reach: Thy purposes their scope fulfil In sequence, resting each on each. In Thee is nothing sudden; nought From harmony and law that swerves: The orbits of Thine act and thought In soft gradation wind their curves. O then with what a gradual care Must Thou have shaped that Ark and Shrine Ordained the Eternal Word to bear, That Garden of Thy mystic Vine! How white a gift within her breast Lay stored, for Him a couch to strew! How vast a virtue lined His nest! How many a grace beside Him grew! Of love on love what sweet excess! How deep a faith! a hope how high!— Mary! on earth of thee we guess; But we shall see thee when we die. XLIV. SPIRITUS SPONSA. As though, fast-borne the hills along, At dawn some shepherd girl or boy Should wrestle with the lark in song And, shaft for shaft, retort his joy, So walked, the hills of Truth above, The Bride Elect, the sinless Maid; So, challenged by the all-heavenly Love The all-heavenly Lover's voice repaid. From zenith heights incessant fell On her His Grace like sunny rain: Unvanquished and invincible Her heart repaid that golden grain. Perchance, in many an instant gleam She caught, unscorched and unabashed, That vision of the Face supreme Which on her first-born spirit flashed! Diseased are we: the infectious fire Corrupts our life-blood from our birth: She, she was like the unfallen Sire, Compacted out of virgin earth. In God she lived: His world she trod: Saw Him and His; saw nought beside— He only lives who lives in God: That hour when Adam fell, he died. XLV. ORANTE. She mused upon the Saints of old; Rock-like, on rock she stood, foot-bare: On Him she mused, that Child foretold; To Him she held her hands in prayer, Unwavering hands that, drawing fires Of grace from heaven, our earth endowed With heavenly breath like mountain spires That suck the lightning from the cloud. No moment passed without its crown; And each new grace was used so well It dragged some tenfold talent down, Some miracle on miracle. O golden House! O boundless store Of wealth by heavenly commerce won! When God Himself could give no more, He gave thee all; He gave His Son! XLVI. RESPEXIT HUMILITATEM. Not all thy Purity, although The whitest moon that ever lit The peaks of Lebanonian snow Shone dusk and dim compared with it; Not that great Love of thine whose beams Transcended in their virtuous heat Those suns that melt the ice-bound streams And make earth's pulses newly beat; It was not these that from the sky Drew down to thee the Eternal Word: He looked on thy Humility; He knew thee, ‘Handmaid of thy Lord.’ Let no one claim with thee a part, Let no one, Mary, name thy name, While, aping God, upon his heart Pride sits, a Demon robed in flame. Proud Vices, die! Where Sin has place Be Sin's avenger self-disgust: Proud Virtues, doubly die, that Grace At last may burgeon from your dust! XLVII. MULIER FORTIS. Supreme among the things create God's Image with the downward brow! Greatness that know'st not thou art great! Thus great, Humility art thou. All strength beside is weakness. Might Belongs to God; and they alone Self-emptied souls and seeming-slight Are filled with God, and share His throne. O Mary! strong wert thou and meek; Thy meekness gave thee strength divine: Thyself in nothing didst thou seek; Therefore thy Maker made Him thine. Through Pride our parents disobeyed; Rebellious Sense avenged the wrong: The Soul, the body's captive made, No more was fruitful, or was strong. With barrenness the earth was cursed; Inviolate she brought forth no more Her fruits, nor freely as at first: Thou cam'st, her Eden to restore! Low breathes the wind upon the string; The harp, responsive, sounds in turn: Thus o'er thy Soul the Spirit's wing Creative passed; and Christ was born. PART II. THE SPIRITUAL MOTHERHOOD. ‘Behold thy mother.’—John xix. 27. I. AGIOS ATHANATOS. Cloud-piercing Mountains! Chance and Change More high than you their thrones advance! Self-vanquished Nature's rockiest range Gives way before them like the trance Of one that wakes. From morn to eve Through fissured clefts her mists make way; At Night's cold touch they freeze, and cleave Her crags, and with a Titan's sway Flake off and peel the rotting rocks, And heap the glacier tide below With isles of sand and floating blocks Like leaves on streams when tempests blow. Lo, thus the great decree all-just O Earth, thy mountains hear; and learn Like man its awful import—‘dust Thou art, and shalt to dust return.’ He only is Who ever was; The All-measuring Mind; the Will Supreme: Rocks, mountains, worlds, like bubbles pass: God is; the things not God but seem. II. PASTOR ETERNUS. I scaled the hills. No murky blot No mist obscured the diamond air: One time, O God, those hills were not! Thou spak'st: at Thy command they were! O'er ebon meres the ledges hung; High up were summits white with snow: Some peak athwart the mountains flung A crownéd Shadow creeping slow. Still crept it onwards. Vague and vast From ridge to ridge the mountains o'er That king-like Semblance slowly passed: A shepherd's crook for staff it bore. O Thou that leadest like a sheep Thine Israel! all the earth is Thine! Thy mystic Manhood still must sweep Thy worlds with healing shade divine. The airy pageant died with day: The hills, the worlds themselves must die: But Thou remainest such alway: Thy Love is from Eternity. III. JESUM OSTENDE. Who doubts that thou art finite? Who Is ignorant that from Godhead's height To what is loftiest here below The interval is infinite? O Mary! with that smile thrice-blest Upon their petulance look down; Their dull negation, blind protest: Thy smile will melt away their frown. Show them thy Son! That hour their heart Will beat and burn with love like thine; Grow large; and learn from thee that art Which communes best with things divine. The man who grasps not what is best In creaturely existence, he Is narrowest in the brain, and least Can grasp the thought of Deity. IV. TURRIS EBURNEA. This scheme of worlds which vast we call Is only vast compared with man: Compared with God, the One yet All, Its greatness dwindles to a span. A Lily with its isles of buds Asleep on some unmeasured sea:— O God, the starry multitudes What are they more than this to Thee! Yet, girt by Nature's petty pale Each tenant holds the place assigned To each in Being's awful scale: The last of creatures leaves behind The abyss of Nothingness: the first Into the abyss of Godhead peers Waiting that Vision which shall burst In glory on the eternal years. Tower of our Hope! through thee we climb Finite creation's topmost stair; Through thee from Sion's height sublime Towards God we gaze through clearer air. Infinite distance still divides Created from Creative Power; But all which intercepts and hides Lies dwarfed by that surpassing Tower! V. CONSERVABAT IN CORDE. As every change of April sky Is imaged in the unchangeful brook Her meditative memory Mirrored His every deed and look. As suns through summer ether rolled Mature each growth the spring has wrought, Her love's calm solstice turned to gold Her harvests of quiescent thought. Her soul was as a vase, and shone Illumed but with the interior ray; Her Maker's finger wrote thereon A mystic Bible new each day. Deep Heart! In all His sevenfold might The Paraclete with thee abode, And, sacramented there in light, Bare witness of the things of God. VI. THE KINDLY TRANSIENCE. ‘Like flowers,’ they tell us, ‘Life must fade!’ Ah flower-faced Friend! if flowers must die Immortal sweets of these are made: Thus Time bequeaths Eternity. ‘Life is a fleeting shade!’ What then? The Substance doth the Shadow cast: Essential Life, it recks not when, Shall crown this seeming Life at last! Thus, while May breezes whirling caught Dead leaves poor spoils of winter gone Half-truths, deciduous spoils of Thought, Their clothing from on high put on: And better far it seemed to plight To earth a transient troth and trust Than with corruption wed, and blight The Spirit's hope with deathless dust. VII. Stronger and steadier every hour The pulses of the season's glee As higher climbs that vernal Power Which rules the azure revelry. Trees that from winter's grey eclipse Of late but pushed their topmost plume Or felt with green-touched finger-tips For spring, their perfect robes assume. Like one that reads not one that spells The unvarying rivulet onward runs: And bird to bird from leafier cells Sends forth more leisurely response. Through gorse-gilt coverts bounds the deer; The gorse, whose latest splendours won Make all the fulgent wolds appear Bright as the pastures of the sun. A balmier zephyr curls the wave; More purple flames o'er ocean dance; And the white breaker by the cave Falls with more cadenced resonance; While, vague no more, the mountains stand With quivering line or hazy hue, But drawn with finer firmer hand, And settling into deeper blue. VIII. MARIÆ CLIENS. A little longer on the earth That aged creature's eyes repose Though half their light and all their mirth Are gone; and then for ever close. She thinks that something done long since Ill pleases God: or why should He So long delay to take her hence Who waits His will so lovingly? Whene'er she hears the church-bells toll She lifts her head, though not her eyes With wrinkled hands, but youthful soul Counting her lip-worn rosaries. And many times the weight of years Falls from her in her waking dreams: A child her mother's voice she hears: To tend her father's steps she seems. Once more she hears the whispering rains On flowers and paths her girlhood trod; Yet of things present nought remains Save one abiding sense of God. Mary! make smooth her downward way! Not dearer to the young thou art Than her. Make glad her latest May; And hold her, dying, on thy heart! IX. IN MORTE TUTAMEN. It was the dread last Eucharist: The hopes and fears of earth were gone; The latest, lingering friend dismissed; The bed was ashes strewed o'er stone. It was the dear last Eucharist: The old man lay in silent prayer: His heart was now a shrine; and Christ Was with His Mother whispering there. He heard them; heard within that veil Voices that Angels may not hear, Not he that said to Mary, ‘hail,’ Not he that watched the Sepulchre; Voices that met with touch like light; Murmurs that mixed, as when their breath Two pine trees, side by side, unite: Of Love one whispered; one of Death. X. SPECULUM JUSTITIÆ. Not in Himself the Eternal Word Lay hid upon Creation's day: His Loveliness abroad He poured On all the worlds, and pours for aye. Not in Himself the Incarnate Son In whom Man's race is born again His glory hides. The victory won He rose to send His ‘Gifts on Men.’ In sacraments, His dread behests, In Providence, in granted prayer, Before the time He manifests His Presence, far as man may bear. He shines not from a vault of gloom; The horizon round His splendour paints: The sphere of Souls His beams illume; His light is glorious in His Saints. He shines upon His Church that Moon Who, in the watches of the night, Transmits to Earth the entrusted boon, A sister orb of sacred light. And thou, pure mirror of His grace! As sun reflected in a sea, So, Mary, feeblest eyes the face Of Him thou lov'st discern in thee. XI. AUXILIUM CHRISTIANORUM. Not for herself doth Mary hold That Mother-Crown, that Queenly Throne; The loftiest in the Saviour's Fold The least possesses of her own. Pure thoughts that make to God their quest With her find footing o'er the clouds, Like those sea-crossing birds that rest A moment on the sighing shrouds. In her our hearts, no longer nursed On dust, for spiritual beauty yearn; From her our instincts, as at first, An upward gravitation learn. Through her draw nigh the things remote: For in true love's supernal sphere No more round self the affections float, More near to God, to man more near. In her, the weary warfare past, The port attained, the exile o'er, We see the Church's bark at last Close-anchored on the eternal shore! XII. O Cowslips sweetening lawn and vale, O Harebells drenched in noontide dew, O moon-white Primrose, Wind-flower frail! The song should be of her, not you! The May breeze answered, whispering low, ‘Not thine: they sing her praises best! The flowers her grace in theirs can show: Her claims they prove not, yet attest. ‘Beneath all fair things round thee strewn Her beauty lurks, by sense unseen: Who lifts their veil uprears a throne In holy hearts to Beauty's Queen.’ XIII. AB ETERNO ORDINATA. Eternal Beauty, ere the spheres Had rolled from out the gulfs of night, Sparkled, through all the unnumbered years Before the Eternal Father's sight: Truth's solemn reflex—not a Dream— Created Wisdom's smile unpriced— Before His eyes it hung, a gleam Flashed from the eternal Thought of Christ. It hung, the unbodied antitype Of all Creation shapes and sings; That finite world which Time makes ripe, Which Uncreated Light enrings. Star-like within the depths serene Of that still vision, Mary, thou With Him, thy Son, of God wert seen Millenniums ere the lucid brow Of Eve o'er Eden founts had bent, Millenniums ere that second Pair With shame the hopes of man had blent, Had stained the brightness once so fair. Elect of Creatures! Man in thee Beholds that primal Beauty yet; Sees all that Man was formed to be, Sees all that Man can ne'er forget! XIV. Three worlds there are—the first of Sense— That sensuous earth which round us lies; The next, of Faith's Intelligence; The third, of Glory, in the skies. The first is palpable, but base; The second heavenly, but obscure; The third is star-like in the face, But ah! remote that world as pure. Yet, glancing through our misty clime, Some sparkles from that loftier sphere Make way to earth; then most what time The annual spring-flowers re-appear. Amid the coarser needs of earth All shapes of brightness, what are they But wanderers exiled from their birth Or pledges of a happier day? Yea, what is Beauty, judged aright, But some surpassing, transient gleam; Some smile from heaven, in waves of light Rippling o'er life's distempered dream? Or broken memories of that bliss Which rushed through first-born Nature's blood When He who ever was, and is Looked down, and saw that all was good? XV. Alas! not only loveliest eyes And brows with lordliest lustre bright But Nature's self, her woods and skies The credulous heart can cheat or blight. And why? Because the sin of man 'Twixt Fair and Good has made divorce And stained, since Evil first began, That stream so heavenly at its source. O perishable vales and groves! Your master was not made for you: Ye are but creatures! human loves Are to the great Creator due. And yet, through Nature's symbols dim There are with keener sight that pierce The outward husk and reach to Him Whose garment is the universe. For this to earth the Saviour came In flesh; in part for this He died; That man might have in soul or frame No faculty unsanctified. That Fancy's self, so prompt to lead Through paths disastrous or defiled, Upon the Tree of Life might feed; And Sense with Soul be reconciled. XVI. IDOLATRIA. The fancy of an age gone by When Fancy's self to earth declined Still thirsting for Divinity Yet still, through sense, to Godhead blind Poor mimic of that Truth of old The Patriarchs' Faith—a Faith revealed— Compressed its God in mortal mould Poor prisoner of Creation's field. Nature and Nature's Lord were one! Then countless gods from cloud and stream Glanced forth; from sea, and moon, and sun: So ran the Pantheistic dream. And thus the All-Holy, thus the All-True, The One Supreme, the Good, the Just, Like mist was scattered, lost like dew, And vanished in the wayside dust. Mary! through thee the idols fell: When He the Nations longed for ‘The Desire of the Nations.’ came— True God yet Man, with man to dwell, The phantoms hid their heads for shame. His place, or thine, removed, ere long The Bards would push the Sects aside; And, lifted by the might of song, Olympus stand re-edified! XVII. ‘IN HIM WE HAVE OUR BEING.’ The God who lives in those bright flowers That wave and flash from yonder rock O children singing 'mid your bowers In you lives also, pleased to mock His own unmoved Immensity With you—in you—to sport and play: As ripples on a summer sea Are ye: unchanged that sea for aye! Thus much of Truth they knew that feigned Of old, their God with Nature one: Another, loftier truth remained For us, which now they read who run. Half-truths are Falsehood's baits: too near They roam to Error's maze of doubt, And, like some scared, outlying deer, O'er-leap the limit, in and out. Such quarry, hunter youths, beware! That bourne is demon-haunted ground; And, bone from bone, the demons tear The man who steps beyond its bound. XVIII. TOTA PULCHRA. A broken gleam on wave and flower, A music that in utterance dies, A redd'ning leaf, a falling shower, Behold that Beauty which we prize! And ah! how oft Corruption works Through that brief Beauty's force or wile! How oft a gloom eternal lurks Beneath an evanescent smile! But thou, serene and smiling light Of every grace to man benign, In thee all harmonies unite; All minstrelsies of Truth are thine. Of old whate'er to mind or heart Was dear ‘had leave’ with thee to rest: The ‘little birds’ of every Art Hung on thy Fane their procreant nest. XIX. ‘AD NIVES.’ Before the morn began to break The Bright One bent above that pair Whose childless vows aspired to take The Mother of their Lord for heir. 'Twas August: even in midnight shade The roofs were hot, and hot the street: ‘Build me a fane,’ that Vision said, ‘Where first your eyes the snow shall meet.’ Santa Maria Maggiore, on the Esquiline, at Rome. With snow the Esquiline was strewn At morn!—Fair Legend! who but thinks Of thee, when first the breezes blown From summer Alp to Alp he drinks? He stands: he hears the torrents dash: The sultry valley steams; and lo! Through chasms of endless azure flash The peaks of everlasting snow! He stands; he listens; on his ear Swells softly forth some virgin hymn, The white procession winding near With glimmering lights in sunshine dim. Mother of Purity and Peace! They sing the Saviour's name and thine— Clothe them for ever with the fleece Unspotted of thy Lamb divine! XX. FEST. PURITATIS. Far down the bird may sing of love; The honey-bearing blossom blow: But hail ye hills that rise above The limit of perpetual snow! O Alpine City, with thy walls Of rock eterne and spires of ice Where torrent still to torrent calls And precipice to precipice; How like that holier City thou The heavenly Salem's earthly porch, Which rears among the stars her brow And plants firm feet on earth—the Church! ‘Decaying, ne'er to be decayed,’ Her woods like thine renew their youth: Her streams, in rocky arms embayed, Are clear as virtue, strong as truth. At times the lake may burst its dam; Black pine and rock the valley strew; But o'er the ruin soon the lamb Its flowery pasture crops anew. Like thee in regions near the sky She piles her cloistered snows, and thence Diffuses gales of purity O'er fields of consecrated sense. On those still heights a lovelight glows The plains from them above receive; Not all the Lily! There thy Rose, O Mary, triumphs, morn and eve! Through thee Art preached, 'mid change and strife, The eternal Peace, the immortal Love, And o'er the weeping vale of life Her heavenly rainbow Painting wove. Those pictures, fair as moon or star, The ages dear to Faith brought forth Formed but the illumined calendar Of her that Church which knows thy worth. Not less doth Nature teach through thee That mystery hid in hues and lines: Who loves thee not hath lost the key To all her sanctuaries and shrines. XXI. The night through yonder cloudy cleft With many a lingering last regard, Withdraws—but slowly—and hath left Her mantle on the darksome sward. The lawns with silver dews are strewn! The winds lie hushed in cave and tree; Nor stirs a flower, save one alone That bends beneath the earliest bee. Peace over all the garden broods; Pathetic sweets the thickets throng; Like breath the vapour o'er the woods Ascends, dim woods without a song; Or hangs, a shining, fleece-like mass O'er half yon lake that winds afar Among the forests, still as glass, The mirror of that Morning Star Which, halfway wandering from the sky, Amid the glimmering dawn delays, And, large and less alternately, Bends down a lustrous, tearful gaze. Mother and home of Spirits blest! Bright gate of Heaven and golden bower! Thy best of blessings, love and rest, On earth, ere yet thou leav'st her, shower! XXII. STELLA MATUTINA. Shine out, O Star, and sing the praise Of that unrisen Sun whose glow Thus feeds thee with thine earlier rays: The secret of thy song we know. Thou sing'st that Sun of Righteousness, Sole light of this benighted globe Whose beams, from Him reflected, dress His Mother in her shining robe! Pale Lily, pearled around with dew, Lift high that heaven-illumined vase And sing the glories ever new Of her, God's chalice, ‘full of grace.’ Cerulean Ocean fringed with white That wear'st her colours evermore In all thy pureness, all thy might, Resound her name from shore to shore, Her name, and His, that, like thy rim Of light the dusky lands around, Still girds Creation's shadow dim With Incarnation's shining bound. Transfigured Earth, disguised too long, It falls—that Pagan mask of Sense! Burst forth, dumb worlds, at last in song Of spiritual Intelligence! XXIII. THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT. Man's soul a palace is: therein A kingly senate sits in state: But under-winding caves of Sin A pestilence all round create. Man's head uptowers in arctic air: O'er temperate zones his heart hath sway: But tropic sands there are; and there The lions of our nature prey. Dread Maker of our twofold being In night and day alternate robed, Shine on us, that the monsters, fleeing, May leave Thine Image throned and globed! Shine on us;—and thou shinest! sun-bright Flash back the ransomed fields and meads Trod by that Form compact of light That only mid the lilies feeds. O earth, partaker of the curse, Thy glory fled when Adam fell: Yet, not her mother but her nurse, Of Mary earth was capable! XXIV. MADE SUBJECT TO VANITY. Poor earthly House of flesh and blood! Imprisoned Spirit's mortal mould What rapture-thrills in fount and flood Are thine, and on the windy wold! And yet what art thou? Bond and chain! To cheat the whole, thou giv'st the part: The mother clasps her babe—'tis vain; She cannot hide him in her heart! The whole great Soul would hear, would see: The sense is bound to eye, to ear: Still ‘Touch me not,’ remains for thee: ‘Not yet ascended,’ still we hear! O pure in life, O sweet in death O sweet and sinless flesh of flowers I would that life with such light breath Such sweetness born of death, were ours! XXV. MATER DIVINÆ GRATIÆ. The gifts a mother showers each day Upon her softly-clamorous brood, The gifts they value but for play, The graver gifts of clothes and food, Whence come they but from him who sows With harder hand, and reaps, the soil; The merit of his labouring brows, The guerdon of his manly toil? From Him the Grace: through her it stands Adjusted, meted, and applied; And ever, passing through her hands, Enriched it seems, and beautified. Love's mirror doubles Love's caress: Love's echo to Love's voice is true: Their Sire the children love not less Because they clasp a Mother too. XXVI. MATER DIVINÆ GRATIÆ. ‘They have no wine.’ The tender guest Was grieved their feast should lack for aught: He seemed to slight her mute request: Not less the grace she wished He wrought. O great in Love! O full of Grace That winds in thee a river broad From Christ, with heaven-reflecting face, Gladdening the City of thy God! Be this thy gift: that man henceforth No more should creep through life content, Draining the springs impure of earth With life's material element. Let sacraments to sense succeed: Let nought be winning, nought be good Which fails of Him to speak, and bleed Once more with His all-cleansing blood! ‘They have no wine.’ At heaven's high Feast That soft petition still hath place, And bathes—so wills that Kingly Priest Whose ‘Hour is come’—the worlds with Grace. XXVII. DETACHMENT. From sin but not alone from sin That Bright One of the worlds was free; Never there stirred her breast within, That downward Creature-Sympathy Which clouds the strong eyes that discern Through all things, One, the All-True, All-just, And bids the infirmer instinct yearn To beauteous nothings writ in dust. Clear shines o'er glooming waves afar Yon cottage fire, as daylight dies, How pure—till comes the evening star To shame it from untainted skies! O Mary, in thy Daughters still Thine image pure, if pale, we find; The crystal of the flawless will; The soul irradiating the mind; The heart where live, in memory sheathed, But ghosts of mortal joy or grief Like wood-scents through a Bible breathed By some thin-pressed long-cherished leaf; The tender strength, the bliss heaven-taught, Unguessed by Time's distempered thrall; The lucid depth of loving thought, The peace divine encircling all. In Him, the Unseen, their wealth they hoard: They sit, in self-oblivion sweet The Virgin-Spouses of their Lord, Beside the Virgin-Mother's feet. XXVIII. THE BEGINNING OF MIRACLES. The water changed to wine she saw: She saw nought else of shapes around: With such a trance of loving awe That first of signs her spirit bound. She saw in perspective benign Whate'er that first of signs rehearsed, That later chalice, and the wine More changed, that slaked a holier thirst. She saw calm homes of love and rest The earthly life to heaven allied The deaths sabbatical and blest Of Saints that died as Joseph died. She saw a world serene, august, A world new-made, whose every part Was fashioned, not of sinful dust, But in, and from the Saviour's Heart. She saw the stream of human kind So long defiled with weeds and mud In fontal pureness onward wind To meet the eternal ocean flood Within whose breast a love-star shook More fair than he that from the skies, As home their silent way they took, Illlumed her never tearless eyes. XXIX. FILIA MARIÆ. One thought alone 'mid all this sea Of vernal bliss disturbs my breast: What have I suffered, Lord, for Thee, Or how my love aright confessed? Command me tasks that Love may show He needs no violet-scented bowers; Some pain to bear, some joy forego, Some task, not chos'n, of arduous hours. I mused upon Thy work and Thee: Hardness I sought, and shunned delights: Where blows the flower and sucks the bee I found Thee not; I clomb the heights. Them, too, I feared; to city-ways I fled; hot court, and fevered stair: There too were beauty, love, and praise: The Saviour's bleeding steps were there. XXX. EXPECTATIO. A sweet exhaustion seems to hold In spells of calm the shrouded eve: The gorse itself a beamless gold Puts forth: yet nothing seems to grieve. The dewy chaplets hang on air; The willowy fields are silver-grey; Sad odours wander here and there; And yet we feel that it is May. Relaxed and with a broken flow From dripping bowers low carols swell In mellower, glassier tones, as though They mounted through a bubbling well. The crimson orchis scarce sustains Upon its drenched and drooping spire The burden of the warm soft rains; The purple hills grow nigh and nigher. Nature, suspending lovely toils, On expectations lovelier broods, Listening, with lifted hand, while coils The flooded rivulet through the woods. She sees, drawn out in vision clear, A world with summer radiance drest And all the glories of that year Still sleeping in her sacred breast. XXXI. Whitens the green field, daisy-strewn; A richer fragrance loads the breeze; Full-flowering meadows sweep, tall-grown, The bending boughs of greener trees. Whitens the thorn, like yonder snow That crowns, not clothes, the hills aloof: Empurpled skies more darkly glow Through chasms of denser forest roof. The silver treble of the bird O'erruns her music's graver base That golden murmur always heard That dins the universal space, Commingled sound of insect swarm And vagrant bee, and wandering stream, And workings of the woodlands warm By summer yearnings touched in dream. O Nature, make thy children thine! Erase the stain; burn out the blot; Like her of Mothers most benign, The sole that, loving, flatters not. XXXII. ‘JESUS AND HIS MOTHER WERE THERE.’ Love, youthful love, that mean'st so well, And spread'st thy wings to soar so high, Yet, backward blown by gusts from hell On desert sands so oft dost die! For thee what help? From pride? from scorn? Ah! love alone is love's defence, True love, of love celestial born, And nursed in caves of Reverence. Childhood thrice-blest! thine every thought Reveres superior mind or power That, sown in darkness, may be wrought From Reverence love's consummate flower! A sinless man, a sinless mate Walked, linked in God, o'er Eden's sward: But He who links holds separate:— Between them paced Whom both adored! O Face so like thy Son's look forth Through clouds that blot this mortal scene And, teaching woman's spiritual worth, The heart of man with fire make clean: That so once more with spotless feet Upon a world-wide Eden's sod Humanity may stand complete One image, dual-cast from God; And, dual-crowned—like that fair hill Parnassian, which from summits twain Flashed back the morning bright and still Echoing the Muses' vestal strain— May sing the Heavenly Lover's praise With voices twain, yet lost in one, And learn that only when we raise Our hearts, they beat in unison. XXXIII. LUMEN NUPTIARUM. Say, who is she that walks on air Nor stains her foot with sinful earth? The all-tender Vestal, chaste and fair, In death more blameless than at birth. Say, who is she serenely blest That walks the dustier ways of life With foot immaculate as her breast? That Woman maid, the Christian Wife! Her love, a full-blown rose, each hour Its snowy bud regerminates; The star of Eden lights her bower; Her children's laughter cheers its gates. Yet half she is, that wife—still bride— Owes to that vestal never wed, As Homes through Him are sanctified Who had not where to lay His head. XXXIV. The golden day is dead at last, And hiding all their blossoms white In one deep shade the bowers are massed, So feebly o'er them plays the light Of those uncertain, moonless skies Bewildered with a silver haze, Through which the unnumbered starry eyes Bend tearful down a trembling gaze. Against the horizon's pallid line Where western heaven with ocean blends, Far seen yon solitary Pine Its cloud-like canopy suspends. Ah! hark, that Convent's chime! It swells From dusky turrets far away: To shepherds half asleep it tells That Mary's daughters watch and pray. XXXV. If God for each fair action wrought On earth, with wholly pure intent, Should call an Angel out of nought Thenceforth in heaven its monument, To prove the all-fruitful strength and worth Of pureness perfect; and to show That life in heaven may owe its birth To humblest Virtue tried below; How often angel choirs would fleet From heaven the shadowy gulf across, Some death-delivered Soul to greet Assoiled, ere death, from mortal dross; Some Vestal from the cloister shade Still pale, some village maid as pure, That smiled to see her beauty fade, Worked on for God in age obscure— ‘Hail, Mother of our Joy!’ how oft In hearts that knew not earthly ties That angel Salutation soft Would wake the beautiful surprise, As forward through the realms of light That Soul, on angel-litter borne, Made way, an eddy silver-bright Through gold seas of the eternal morn! XXXVI. ‘WHEN THOU HAST SET MY HEART AT LIBERTY.’ How narrow earthly loves, even those Clouded the least by earthly stain! What bars of Self around them close! Not Death itself can burst that chain. We love amiss; we sorrow worse; Wan vintage of a barren sun We drain around an ill-waked corse In death-vaults of delight foregone. O thou whose love to Him was knit So near thee, yet so high above; In whom to love was to submit, In whom Submission meant but Love; Whose heart great Love dilated so That by His Cross, a Mother twice, All men thy sons became; whose Woe But crowned true Love's Self-Sacrifice; Make thou the bosom, pure before, Through grief more solid-pure to grow; The lily vase that shook of yore Make thou the lily filled with snow! The thought of thee among the Blest O'er earth a bliss snow-pure doth breathe: Thy rest in heaven diffuses rest O'er those who love and mourn beneath. XXXVII. GRATIÆ PLENA. If he of Angels first and best Chief Ardour of the Seraph fires More graces clasps than all the rest, Perchance than all their ninefold choirs, (That so proportioned worth and place May wed, nor even war with odd) What plenitude of conquering grace Must fill the Mother of her God! Their greatness stands in limits curbed Of sequent rank and grade; but she Is one and whole, a world full-orbed, An Order sole, and Hierarchy: Of things create both last and first; Added, that so from Adam's crime Her Son might save the race accursed; Decreed before the birth of time. Hail, Full of Grace! To eyes of men Light shows not mid excess of light: Thy glory mocks the angelic ken, The peerless whiteness of thy white! And yet 'twixt her and us but small The distance:—finite it must be: 'Twixt her and God the interval Is evermore infinity. XXXVIII. VAS INSIGNE DEVOTIONIS. O strong in prayer! our spirits bind To God: our bodies keep from sin: Live in our hearts that Christ may find An incorrupt abode therein: That He, the Eternal Spirit, He Who overshadowed with His Grace The depths of thy Humility In us may have a resting-place. Who love thee prosper! As a breeze Thou waft'st them o'er the ways divine: Strange heights they reach with magic ease Through music-moulded discipline. ‘If I but touch His vesture's hem I shall be healed, and strong, and free’— Thou wert His Vesture, Mary! them His virtue heals that reach to thee. XXXIX. THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT. How oft that Sadducean fool That imped with feathers from the jay As hard a heart, a brain as dull As e'er were bubble-blown from clay, How oft his half-shut eye had roved From sacred page to page, and read Those words that, unaffirming, proved The Resurrection from the Dead! ‘The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Words plainer were there: ‘I shall go To him; he cannot come to me’— ‘Though worms consume this Body, lo! I in my flesh my God shall see.’ Such words the Saviour challenged not: He willed to prove that at the core Of well-known words to reverent Thought There lurked a mine of unknown lore. ‘What texts avouch her greatness?’ Two, For those the Letter's rind who pierce; The Ancient Record and the New: In Christ they meet; and Christ is hers. XL. THE ‘SINGLE EYE.’ The spirit intricately wise That bends above his ciphered scroll Only to probe and analyse, The self-involved and sunless soul Has not the Truth he holds, though plain; For Truth divine is gift, not debt: Her living waters wouldst thou drain? Let down the pitcher, not the net! But they, the spirits frank and meek, Nor housed in self, nor science-blind, Who welcome Truths they did not seek;— Truth comes to them in every wind. Beside his tent's wide open door With open heart, and open eye The Patriarch sat, when they who wore That triad type of God drew nigh. The world of Faith around us lies Like nature's world of life and growth: Seeing to see it needeth eyes And heart, profound and simple both. XLI. MYSTICA. As pebbles flung for sport, that leap Along the superficial tide But enter not those chambers deep Wherein the jewel'd beds abide, Such those light minds that, grazing, spurn The surface text of Sacred Lore, Yet ne'er its deeper sense discern Its halls of mystery ne'er explore. Ah! not for such the unvalued gems! The priceless pearls of Truth they miss: Not theirs the starry diadems That light God's temple in the abyss! Ah! not for such to gaze on her That moves through all that empire pale; At every shrine doth minister, Yet never lifts her sacred veil! ‘The letter kills.’ Make pure thy Will; So shalt thou pierce the Text's disguise: Till then, revere the veil that still Hides Truth from truth-affronting eyes. XLII. BEATI QUI AUDIUNT VERBUM DEI. When from the crowd that voice was raised That blessed the Mother of the Lord Not her the Son who loved her praised But all who heard, and kept His word. O answer meet! to her how dear To her too great her crown to boast! The meek were glad that praise to hear: The meekest, loftiest, joyed the most. Above her soul's pure mirror crept No mist: no doubt within her stirred: She asked not ‘who His words hath kept Like her, the mother of the Word?’ Her tender heart rejoiced to think That all who say, ‘Thy Will be mine,’ Without, or with the external link, In heart bring forth the Babe divine. Chief of the Prophets John might be, Yet, but for that his happier place In Jesus' kingdom, less than he The least one in the realm of Grace. The mother of Incarnate God Some Prophet's mother seemed, alone: His hour not yet was come: abroad To noise her fame had noised his own. XLIII. AUTHENTIC THEISM. A trivial age with petty sneer Rebukes a creed for it too large And little deems how subtly near To falsehood's blindest is its charge. The authentic Thought of God at last To it grows pale through Error's mist: Upon that mist Man's image cast Becomes the new God-Mechanist. The vast Idea shrivels up: Truth narrows with the narrowing soul: Men sip it from the acorn's cup: Their fathers drained the golden bowl. Shrink, spelled and dwarfed, their earth, their skies; Shrinks in their hand the measuring-rod; With dim yet microscopic eyes They chase a daily-dwindling God. His temple, thus to crypt reduced For ancient Faith has space no more Or her, its Queen. To hearts abused By sense, prime truths are true no more. XLIV. ‘TESTE DAVID CUM SIBYLLA.’(Plato.) O Thou of amplest brow, and eye Resplendent most with piercing beam, Prime Teacher of antiquity That through thy shadowy Academe Didst walk, the boast of Grecian years, Of man conversing and the Soul Until the music of the spheres Around thy listeners seemed to roll; Thy theme was still the unsensuous Mind That moulds and makes our worlds of sense, The Truth in fleeting forms enshrined Its own all-conquering evidence: Olympian fancies, winged with speech Descending lit that arduous theme Like Pindan swans, each following each, Adown some forest-darkened stream. Ilyssus 'mid the reeds withheld His wave to list a statelier ode Than ever in that holy eld From Sophoclean chorus flowed: Man, man thou sang'st in strain heaven-taught, Thy State's Exemplar, Type, and Plan, Man, born of God's eternal Thought— Ah, hadst thou heard of God made man! XLV. ‘TESTE DAVID CUM SIBYLLA.’(Plato.) He looked on the transcendent light, And, by the greatness of the fall Measuring the unfallen Spirit's height That Spirit deemed the body's thrall. He knew the light, but not the love, The sin, but not that Cross of shame Which raised us sinless spheres above! Perhaps in death that knowledge came In death that vision o'er him stood Which all atoned, and all sufficed, That Vision of Incarnate God, The Mother-maid, the Infant Christ! Perhaps, where'er the heart is pure In Gentile or in Christian lands, Despite dim clouds of faith obscure By dying beds that Vision stands To ripen in a moment's space Truth's harvest, slumbering long in seed, And fit—to meet the Judge's face— With love in fear the Spirit freed! XLVI. ‘TESTE DAVID CUM SIBYLLA.’(Idea Platonica.) ‘The everlasting hills present God's Steadfastness to mortal ken: His Ways the trackless firmament: The deep His Counsels hid from men.’ What follows? All that meets our eyes Now dimmed by life's distempered dream Is revelation in disguise; It shrouds, yet shows, the One supreme! Throughout all worlds there liveth nought But lived, unmade, unchangeable For aye in God's creative Thought Which cast Creation's glistening shell. Him first, Him most, His works express: But Nature's myriad-minded plan Hath lesser meanings; and the less Charm most the petty mind of man. Poor captive of a sensuous heart, That mind no longer by the whole Interprets Nature's meaner part— We live in surburbs of the soul! O Death! fling back the gates of sense That man, redeemed from thraldom base, With glorified intelligence At last may see his Maker's Face! Then type to antitype shall yield: Then Truth no more shall show reversed: The golden side of nature's shield Shall smite our vision as at first When God His creatures bade to pass Beneath their master's eye, and he, Fresh from the Godhead, as through glass Discerned in each its mystery; Descried its supernatural law, Inferred its place in nature's frame, And, in the tongue of Gods, with awe Assigned to each its destined Name. XLVII. DEUS ABSCONDITUS. He was no conqueror borne abroad On all the fiery winds of fame That over-sweeps a world o'er-awed In ruin-heaps to write—a Name. No Act triumphant crushed the foe: No word of power redeemed the thrall: By Suffering He prevailed that so His Father might be all in all. His Godhead veiled from mortal eyes Showed forth that Father's Godhead still As calm seas mirror starry skies Because themselves invisible. Thus Mary in the Son was hid: That Son alone that Mother's boast; She nothing said, she nothing did: Her light in His was merged and lost. XLVIII. THE VEIL. For thirty years with her He lurked As secret as the unrisen sun: In three short years His Work He worked: That work we know. The victory won, Once more the veil descends, and shrouds That trance of Love, the Forty Days: Like mountains lost in luminous clouds Their marvels cheat our yearning gaze. The Saints who rose when Jesus died, Lazarus, twice cast from nature's womb, Hidden their after days abide As Enoch's life or Moses' tomb. The Work, the Work, no more, is told: The lore man needs not shuns his sight: Thy Work was this, to clothe in mould Of Adam's race the Infinite. Thy Motherhood thine endless Act In this all lesser praise is drowned: To this to add were to detract: Sole-throned it bideth and self-crowned. XLIX. ‘THE SECRET OF GOD IS WITH THEM THAT FEAR HIM.’ Flower of the darkness that unseen With fragrance fill'st the vernal grove Where hid'st thou? 'Mid the grasses green, Or boughs that bar the blue above? Thou bird that, darkling, sing'st a song That shook the bowers of Paradise Thou too art hid thy leaves among; Thou sing'st unseen of mortal eyes. Of her thou sing'st whose every breath Sweetens a world too base to heed; Of Him, Death's Conqueror, who from Death Alone would take the crown decreed. Thou sing'st that secret gifts are best; That only like to God are they Who keep God's Secret in their breast And hide, as stars are hid by day. L. JANUA CŒLI. They seek not; or amiss they seek; The coward soul, the captious brain: To Love alone those instincts speak Whose challenge never yet was vain. True Gate of Heaven! As light through glass, That God who might—not born of thee— Have come, was pleased to earth to pass Through thine unstained Virginity: Lo! thus aright to know thy Son Through knowledge comes of thee in part, Interior Vision, Spirit-won, High wisdom of the virgin heart. Summed up in thee our hearts behold The glory of created things: From His, thy Son's, corporeal mould Looks forth the eternal King of kings! LI. If sense of Man's unworthiness With Nature's blameless looks at strife, Should wake with wakening May, and press New-born contentment out of life; If thoughts of breed unblest and blind Should stamp upon the springing flower, Or blacker memories haunt the mind As ravens haunt the ruined tower; O then how sweet in heart to breathe Those pure Judean gales once more; From Bethlehem's crib to Nazareth In heart to tread that Syrian shore! To watch that star-like Infant bring To one of soul as clear and white May-lilies, fresh from Siloa's spring Or Passion-flower with May-dews bright; To follow, earlier yet, the feet Of her the ‘hilly land’ who trod With true love's haste, intent to greet That aged saint beloved of God: Before her like a stream let loose The long vale's flowerage, winding, ran: Nature resumed her Eden use; And Earth was reconciled with Man! LII. CAUSA NOSTRÆ LÆTITIÆ. Whate'er is floral on the earth To thee, O Flower, of right belongs, Whate'er is musical in mirth, Whate'er is jubilant in songs. Childhood and springtide never cease For him thy freshness keeps from stain: Dew-drenched for him, like Gideon's fleece, The dusty paths of life remain. For all high thoughts thou bring'st to mind, We love thee:—love thee better yet For all that taint on human kind Thy brightness helps us to forget! Hope, Hope is Strength! That smile of thioe To us is Glory's earliest ray! Through Faith's dim air, O star benign, Look down, and light our onward way! LIII. STELLA MARIS. I left at morn that blissful shore O'er which the fruit-bloom fluttered free; And sailed the wildering waters o'er, Till sunset streaked with blood the sea. My sleep the hoarse sea-thunders broke— Death-visaged cliffs, with feet foam-hid Leaned forth their brows through vapour-smoke Like tower, and tomb, and pyramid. In death-black shadow, ghostly white, The breaker raced o'er foaming shoals: From caverns cold as death all night Came wailings as of suffering Souls. At morn, through clearing mist the star Of ocean o'er the billow rose: Down dropped the elemental war; Tormented chaos found repose. Star of the ocean! dear art thou, Ah! not to sea-worn men alone: The suffering Church, when shines thy brow Upon her penance, stays her moan: The Holy Souls draw in their breath: The sea of anguish rests in peace: And from beyond the gates of death Up swell the anthems of release. LIV. AARONIS VIRGA. Blossom for ever, blossoming Rod! Thou didst not blossom once to die: That Life which, issuing forth from God Thy life enkindled runs not dry. Without a root in sin-stained earth 'Twas thine to bud Salvation's flower: No single soul the Church brings forth But blooms from thee and is thy dower! Rejoice, O Eve! thy promise waned; Transgression nipt thy flower with frost: But, lo! a Mother man hath gained Holier than she in Eden lost. LV. UNICA. While all the breathless woods aloof Lie hushed in noontide's deep repose, That dove, sun-warmed on yonder roof, Ah what a grave content she knows! One note for her! Deep streams run smooth: The ecstatic song of transience tells: What depth on depth of loving truth In that divine content there dwells! All day with down-dropt lids I sat In trance; the present scene forgone: When Hesper rose, on Ararat, Methought, not English hills, he shone. Back to the ark the waters o'er That primal dove pursued her flight: A branch of that blest tree she bore Which feeds God's Church with holy light. I heard her rustling through the air With sliding plume—no sound beside Save the sea-sobbings everywhere, And sighs of that subsiding tide. LVI. REGINA PROPHETARUM. She took the timbrel, as the tide Rushed, refluent, down the Red Sea shore: ‘The Lord hath triumphèd,’ she cried: Her song rang out above the roar Of lustral waves that wall to wall Fell back upon that host abhorred: Above the gloomy watery pall As eagles soar her anthem soared. Miriam, rejoice! a mightier far Than thou one day shall sing with thee! Who rises, brightening like a star Above yon bright baptismal sea? That harp which David touched who rears Heaven-high above those waters wide? The Prophet-Queen! Throughout all years She sings the Triumph of the Bride! LVII. Still on the gracious work proceeds, The good, great tidings preached anew Yearly to green enfranchised meads And fire-topped woodlands flushed with dew. Yon cavern's mouth we scarce can see; Yon rock in gathering bloom lies meshed; And all the wood-anatomy In thickening leaves is over-fleshed. That hermit oak, which frowned so long Upon the spring with barren spleen, Yields to the sinless Siren's song, And bends above her goblet green. Young maples, late with gold embossed Lucidities of sun-pierced limes No more surprise us merged and lost Like prelude notes in deepening chimes. Disordered beauties and detached Demand no more a separate place: The abrupt, the startling, the unmatched, Submit to graduated grace; While upward from the ocean's marge The year ascends with statelier tread To where the sun his golden targe Finds, setting, on yon mountain's head. LVIII. TURRIS DAVIDICA. The towerèd City loves thee well, Strong Tower of David's House! In thee She hails the unvanquished citadel That frowns o'er Error's subject sea. With magic might that Tower repels A host that breaks where foe is none, No foe but statued Saints in cells High-ranged and smiling in the sun. There stands Augustin; Leo there; And Bernard with a maiden face Like John's; and, strong at once and fair, That Spirit-Pythian, Athanase. Upon thy star-surrounded height God's Angel keepeth watch and ward; And sunrise flashes thence ere night Hath left dark street and dewy sward. LIX. ‘TU SOLA INTEREMISTI OMNES HÆRESES.’ What tenderest hand uprears on high The standard of Incarnate God? Successive portents that deny Her Son, who tramples? She who trod Long since on Satan! Who were those That, age by age, their Lord denied? Their seats they set with Mary's foes: They mocked the Mother as the Bride. Of such was Arius; and of such Nestorius.He whom the Ephesian Sentence felled: Deipara.Her Title triumphed. At the touch Of Truth the insurgent rout was quelled: Back, back the hosts of Hell were driven As forth that sevenfold thunder rolled: And in the Church's mystic Heaven There was great silence as of old. LX. UT ACIES ORDINATA. The watchman watched along the walls: And lo! an hour or more ere light Loud rang his trumpet. From their halls The revellers rushed into the night. There hung a terror on the air; There moved a terror under ground; The hostile hosts, heard everywhere, Within, without, were nowhere found. ‘The Christians to the lions! Ho!’ Alas! self-tortured crowds, let be! Let go your wrath; your fears let go: Ye gnaw the net, but cannot flee. Ye drank from out Orestes' cup; Orestes' Furies drave you wild. Who conquers from on high? Look up! A Woman, holding forth a Child! LXI. As children when, with heavy tread, Men sad of face, unseen before, Have borne away their mother dead, So stand the nations thine no more. From room to room those children roam, Heart-stricken by the unwonted black: Their house no longer seems their home: They search; yet know not what they lack: Years pass: Self-Will and Passion strike Their roots more deeply day by day; Old kinsmen sigh; and ‘how unlike’ Is all the tender neighbours say: And yet at moments, like a dream A mother's image o'er them flits: Like hers their eyes a moment beam; The voice grows soft: the brow unknits: Such, Mary, are the realms once thine That know no more thy golden reign: Hold forth from heaven thy Babe divine! O make thine orphans thine again! LXII. SEDES SAPIENTIÆ. O that the wordy war might cease! Self-sentenced Babel's strife of tongues: Loud rings the arena. Athletes, peace! Nor drown the wild-dove's Song of Songs. Alas, the wanderers feel their loss: With tears they seek—ah, seldom found— That peace whose Volume is the Cross; That peace which leaves not holy ground. Mary, the peaceful soul loves thee! A happy child not taught of Scribes He stands beside the Church's knee; From her the lore of Christ imbibes. Hourly he drinks it from her face: For there his eyes, he knows not how, The face of Him she loves can trace, And crowned with thorns the sovereign brow. ‘Behold! all colours blend in white! Behold! all Truths have root in Love!’ So sings, half lost in light of light, Her Song of Songs the mystic Dove. LXIII. TRUTH. Profane are they, and without ruth, Unclean, unholy, and unjust, Who, loving knowledge, love not Truth: Such love is intellectual lust. He loves not Truth who over-runs Like hunting-ground her harvest store Trampling the birthright of his sons; Truth's gambler, staking ‘all’ on ‘more.’ Who Truth from Error scorns to sift; Contemns that Truth enthroned in state, God's Vestal keeping her sweet gift In fruitfulness inviolate; Who thirsts for truths of lesser place, Discovered Fact, or Natural Law, Yet spurns the supernatural base Of Truth's whole kingdom without flaw: For on the adamantine Rock Of Truth, Revealed, and Spirit-proved Stands Faith, and meets the warring shock Of world on world with face unmoved, Thrice blest because not ‘Flesh and Blood’ That knowledge certain and serene To Peter taught of old, but God Sole Teacher of the things unseen. LXIV. IMPLICIT FAITH.‘MULTUM NON MULTA.’ Of all great Nature's tones that sweep Earth's resonant bosom, far or near, Low-breathed or loudest shrill or deep How few are grasped by mortal ear! Ten octaves close our scale of sound: Its myriad grades, distinct or twined, Transcend our hearing's petty bound To us as colours to the blind. In Sound's unmeasured empire thus The heights, the depths alike we miss: Ah, but in measured sound to us A compensating spell there is! In holy music's golden speech Remotest notes to notes respond: Each octave is a world; yet each Vibrates to worlds its own beyond. Our narrow pale the vast resumes; Our sea-shell whispers of the sea: Echoes are ours of angel plumes That winnow far infinity. Clasp thou of Truth the central core! Hold fast that Centre's central sense! An atom there shall fill thee more Than realms on Truth's circumference. That cradled Saviour, mute and small, Was God—is God while worlds endure! Who holds Truth truly holds it all In essence, or in miniature. Know what thou know'st! He knoweth much Who knows not many things: and he Knows most whose knowledge hath a touch Of God's divine simplicity. LXV. MATER VIVENTIUM. In vain thine altars do they heap With blooms of violated May Who fail the words of Christ to keep; Thy Son who love not nor obey. Their songs are as a serpent's hiss; Their praise a poniard's poisoned edge; Their offering taints, like Judas' kiss, The shrine; their vows are sacrilege. Sadly from such thy countenance turns: Thou canst not stretch thy Babe to such Albeit for all thy pity yearns As greet Him with a leper's touch. Who loveth thee must love thy Son: Weak Love grows strong thy smile beneath; But nothing comes from nothing; none Can reap Love's harvest out of Death. LXVI. GEUS NON SANCTA. I toiled along the public path: Loud rang the booths with knave and clown; Now laughter peals, now cries of wrath Assailed the suburb from the town. Pleasure, the kennel Circe, brimmed Her cup for him that passed. Hard by Sabbathless labour, dust-begrimmed Alternated the curse and sigh. ‘Alas,’ I said, ‘no God is here! The World, the Flesh, rule here confest:’ I heard a voice; an Angel near On sailed; an altar touched his breast. He placed it by me, and I knelt; Clamour and shout and dust were gone: I prayed, and in my prayer I felt The peace of God, and heard, ‘walk on; ‘Walk on: the Lands this hour that sleep A sleep of storm, shall wake to pray And, praying, rest; her Feasts shall keep; Their long, sad years thenceforth a May!’ LXVII. MATER VENERABILIS. Come from the midnight mountain tops, The mountains where the panthers play: Descend! the cowl of darkness drops; Come fair and fairer than the day! Our hearts are wounded with thine eyes: They stamp thereon in words of light The mystery of the starry skies; The ‘Name o'er every name’ they write. Come from thy Lebanonian peaks Whose sacerdotal cedars nod Above the world when morning breaks; The Mountain of the House of God. Weakness and Dream have passed like night; Religion claims her ancient bound On-borne in venerable might By lions haled and turret-crowned. LXVIII. The sunless day is sweeter yet Than when the golden sun-showers danced On bower new-glazed or rivulet; And Spring her banners first advanced. By wind unshaken hang in dream The wind-flowers o'er their dark green lair; And those ensanguined cups that seem Not bodied forms but woven of air. Nor bird is heard nor insect flits: A tear-drop glittering on her cheek Composed but shadowed, Nature sits Yon primrose not more staid and meek. The light of pensive hope unquenched On those pathetic brows and eyes, She sits, by silver dew-showers drenched Through which the chill spring odours rise. Was e'er on human countenance shed So sweet a sadness? Once: no more; Then when his charge the Patriarch led Dream-warned to Egypt's distant shore: Down on her Infant Mary gazed; Her face the angels marked with awe; Yet 'neath its dimness, undisplaced, Looked forth that smile the Magians saw. LXIX. THE FOURTH DOLOUR.(The Meeting on Calvary.) She stands before Him on the Road: He bears the Cross; He climbs the Steep: Three times He sinks beneath His load: He sinks to earth: she does not weep. She may not touch that Cross whose weight Against His will a stranger bears: In heart to bear it, and to wait, His upward footsteps, this is hers. She may not prop that thorn-crowned Head: The waves of men between them break: Another's hand the veil must spread Against that forehead and that cheek. Her eyes on His are fastened. Lo! There stand they, met on Calvary's height, Twin mirrors of a single woe Made by reflection infinite. The sons of Sion round them rave: The Roman trumpet storms the wind: They goad him on with spear and stave: He passes by: she drops behind. LXX. REFUGIUM PECCATORUM. Say, who are those that beat with brands Like bandits on our palace-gate? That storm our keep like rebel-bands? That come like Judgment or like Fate? Say, who are those that spurn by night Our sumptuous floors with brazen shoon And banquet halls whose latest light Is lightning, or a dying moon? Say, who are those that by our bed Like giants tower in iron mail; That press against the prostrate head Their foot, and wind through heaven the flail? The Sins are these! Sin-pasturing Past! How in thy darkness they have grown That seemed to die! How we at last To pigmy size have shrunk, self-known! Help, sinless Mother! Bid Him spare! He loves us more—that Judge benign— Than thou. 'Tis He that wills thy prayer: From Him it comes, that love of thine! LXXI. THE FIFTH DOLOUR.(Beside the Cross.) She stood in silence. Slowly passed The hours whose moments dropped in blood: Its frown the Darkness further cast: She moved not: silently she stood. No human sympathy she sought: Her help was God, and God alone; Not even the instinctive respite caught From passionate gesture, sigh or moan. Her silence listened. On the air Like death-bells tolled that prime Decree Which bade the Eternal Victim bear Man's Sin primeval. Let it be! The Women round her heard all day The clash of arms, the scoffing tongue: She heard the breaking of that spray Whereon the fruit of Knowledge hung. Behold the Babe of Bethlehem! Ay! The Infant slumbered on thy breast; And thou that heard'st His earliest cry Must hear His ‘Consummatum est.’ LXXII. STABAT MATER. She stood: she sank not. Slowly fell Adown the Cross the atoning blood: In agony ineffable She offered still His own to God. No pang of His her bosom spared; She felt in Him its several power: But she in heart His Priesthood shared: She offered Sacrifice that hour. ‘Behold thy Son!’ Ah, last bequest! It breathed His last farewell! The sword Predicted pierced that hour her breast: She stood: she answered not a word. His own in John He gave. She wore Thenceforth the Mother-crown of Earth. O Eve! thy sentence too she bore; That hour in sorrow she brought forth. LXXIII. REGINA MARTYRUM. That tie, the closest ever twined, That linked a Creature with her God All ties of man in one combined When by His Cross that Creature stood. In both, one Will all wishes quelled: On one great Sire were fixed their eyes: From sister hearts the death-stream welled:— Twins of a single Sacrifice. In death her Spouse, her Son in life, Her wedding-garment was His blood: It clasped her close enough a wife To wear the crown of Widowhood. O Love! alone thy topmost height They tread who stand—thy clouds above— Where all the rock-hewn paths unite That branch from God, and lead to love! LXXIV. THE SIXTH DOLOUR.(Taken down from the Cross.) The Saviour from the Cross they took: Across His Mother's knee He lies: She wept not but a little shook As with dead hand she closed dead eyes. The surface wave of grief we know: By us its depths are unexplored: She treads the still abyss below Following the footsteps of her Lord. Above her head the great floods roll: Before her still He moves—her Hope: And calm in heart of storm her Soul, Calm as the whirlpool's central drop. The Saviour from the Cross they took: Across His Mother's knee He lay: O passers by! be still and look! That Twain compose one Cross for aye. LXXV. THE SEVENTH DOLOUR.(Before the Tomb.) Before the Tomb the Mother sate Amid the new-delved garden ground: Her eyes upon its stony gate Were fixed, while darkness closed around. A wind above the olives crept: It seemed the world's collected sigh: That Mother's eyes their vigil kept: She felt but this; her Lord was nigh. Behind her leaning each on each The Holy Women waited near: Nor any spake of comfort: speech Was slain by sorrow and by fear. From realm to realm of night He passed, That Soul which smote the dark to-day: That Mother's eyes were settled fast Upon the Tomb where Jesus lay. LXXVI. MATER DOLOROSA. From her He passed; yet still with her The endless thought of Him found rest, A sad but sacred branch of myrrh For ever folded in her breast. A Boreal winter void of light— Such seemed her widowed days forlorn: She slept; but in her breast all night Her heart lay waking till the morn. Sad flowers on Calvary that grew; Sad fruits that ripened from the Cross; These were the only joys she knew: Yet all but these she counted loss. Love strong as Death! She lived through thee That mystic life whose every breath From Life's low harpstring amorously Draws out the sweetened name of Death. Love stronger far than Death or Life! Thy martyrdom was o'er at last: Her eyelids dropped; and without strife To Him she loved her spirit passed. PART III. MARIÆ IN CŒLIS. ‘And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. ‘And she brought forth a man-child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her son was taken up to God, and to His throne.’—Apocalypse xii. 1, 5. I. THE ‘UNKNOWN GOD.’ Behind this vast and wondrous frame Of worlds whereof we nothing know Except their aspect and their name, Beneath this blind, bewildering show Of shapes that on the darkness trace Transitions fair and fugitive Lies hid that Power upon whose Face No child of man shall gaze and live. Like one on purple heights that stands While mountain echoes round him roll Screening his forehead with his hands And following far through gulfs of soul Some thought that still before him flies— Thus, Power eternal and unknown, We muse on Thine immensities Yet find Thee in Thy Son alone. Emanuel, God with us, in Him We see the Unmeasured, and the Vast Like mountain outlines, large and dim, On lifted mists at sunrise cast. ‘The Word made Flesh!’ O Power Divine Through Him alone we guess at Thee, And deepliest feel that He is Thine When throned upon His Mother's knee. II. ASCENSIO DOMINI. Rejoice, O Earth, thy crown is won! Rejoice, rejoice, ye heavenly host! And thou, the Mother of the Son, Rejoice the first; rejoice the most! Who captive led captivity, From Hades' void circumference Who raised the Patriarch Band on high, There rules, and sends us graces thence. Rejoice, glad Earth, o'er winter's grave With altars wreathed and clarions blown; And thou, the Race Redeemed, out-brave The rites of Nature with thine own! Rejoice, O Mary! thou that long Didst lean thy breast upon the Sword— Sad nightingale, the Spirit's song That sang'st all night! He reigns, restored! Rejoice! He goes, the Paraclete To send! Rejoice! He reigns on high! That Sword lies broken at thy feet! His triumph is thy victory. III. ASCENSIO DOMINI. I take this reed—I know the hand That wields it must ere long be dust— And write upon the fleeting sand Each tide o'er-sweeps, the words ‘I trust.’ And if that sand one day was stone And stood in courses near the sky For towers by earthquake overthrown Or mouldering piecemeal, what care I? Things earthly perish: life to death And death to life in turn succeeds: The Spirit never perisheth: The chrysalis its Psyche breeds. True life alone is that which soars To Him who triumphed o'er the grave: With Him on life's eternal shores I trust one day a part to have. Ah, hark! above the springing corn That chime! in every breeze it swells! Ye bells that wake the Ascension morn, Ye give us back our Paschal bells! IV. A sudden sun-burst in the woods But late sad Winter's palace dim! O'er quickening boughs and bursting buds Pacific glories shoot and swim. As when some heart, grief-darkened long Conclusive joy by force invades, So swift the new-born splendours throng; Such lustre swallows up the shades. The sun we see not; but his fires From stem to stem obliquely smite Till all the forest aisle respires The golden-tongued and myriad light: The caverns blacken as their brows With floral fire are fringed: but all Yon sombre vault of meeting boughs Turns to a golden fleece its pall As o'er it breeze-like music rolls: O Spring, thy limit-line is crossed! O Earth, some orb of singing Souls Brings down to thee thy Pentecost! V. DOMINICA PENTECOSTES. Clear as those silver trumps of old That woke Judea's jubilee; Strong as the breeze of morning, rolled O'er answering woodlands from the sea That Evangelic anthem vast Which winds, like sunrise, round the globe, Following that sunrise, far and fast And trampling on his fiery robe. Once more the Pentecostal torch Lights on the courses of the year: The ‘Upper Chamber’ of the Church Is thrilled once more with joy and fear. Who rears her brow from out the dust? Who fixes on a world restored A gaze like Eve's, but more august? Who lifts it heaven-ward on her Lord? It is the Birthday of the Bride! The new begins; the ancient ends: From all the gates of Heaven flung wide The promised Paraclete descends. He who o'ershadowed Mary once O'ershades Humanity to-day; And bids her fruitful prove in sons Co-heritors with Christ for aye. VI. DOMINICA PENTECOSTES. The Form decreed of tree and flower The Shape susceptible of life Without the infused, vivific Power Were but a slumber or a strife. He whom the plastic Hand of God Himself created out of earth Remained a statue and a clod Till Spirit infused to life gave birth. So till that hour the Church. In Christ Her awful structure, nerve and bone, Though founded, shaped, and organized Existed but in skeleton Till down on that predestined frame, Complete through all its sacred mould That Pentecostal Spirit came, The self-same Spirit Who of old Creative o'er the waters moved: Thenceforth the Church, made One and Whole, Arose in Him, and lived, and loved; His Temple she, and He her Soul. VII. Here, in this paradise of light, Superfluous were both tree and grass: Enough to watch the sunbeams smite Yon white flower sole in the morass! From his cold nest the skylark springs Soars, pauses, sings; shoots up anew; Attains his topmost height, then sings Quiescent in his vault of blue. With eyes half-closed I watch that lake Flashed from whose plane the sun-sparks fly Like Souls new-born that shoot and break From thy deep sea, Eternity! Ripplings of sunlight from the wave Ascend the white rock high and higher; Soft gurglings fill the satiate cave; Soft airs amid the reeds expire. All round the lone and luminous meer The dark world stretches far and free That skylark's song alone I hear; That flashing wave alone I see. O myriad Earth! Where'er a Word Of thine makes way into the soul An echo million-fold is stirred: Of thee the part is as the whole! VIII. REGINA CŒLI. In some celestial realm we know The God-man keeps His court sublime As Adam ruled the sphere below In that first Eden's sinless prime. He too, that second Adam, hears Those rivers four engird His bound; Serene advance of sleepless years With God's accomplished Counsels crowned, Around Him, close as Eden leaves, The Souls consummate hang in trance: Like wind the Spirit among them weaves Eternal song, or through the expanse On-wafts, like snowy clouds high-piled Those pilgrims of God's trackless Will, The white hosts of the Undefiled Whom love divine alone could fill. The lustral mist for aye ascends: All creatures mix secure from strife: At last the Tree of Knowledge blends Its branches with the Tree of Life. An Eve partakes that Eden. She Who decked His cradle shares His throne:— The Solitudes of Deity These, these are His, and His alone. IX. FEST. SS. TRINITATIS. Fall back, all worlds, into the abyss That man may contemplate once more That which He ever was Who is; The Eternal Essence we adore. Angelic hierarchies! recede Beyond extinct Creation's shade— What were ye at the first? Decreed: Decreed, not fashioned! thought, not made! Like wind the untold Millenniums passed: Sole-throned He sat; yet not alone: Godhead in Godhead still was glassed; The Spirit was breathed from Sire and Son. Prime Virgin, separate and sealed; Nor less of social Love the root! Dimly in lowliest shapes revealed; Entire in every Attribute: Thou liv'st in all things and around; To Thee external is there nought; Thou of the boundless art the bound; And still Creation is Thy Thought. In vain, O God, our wings we spread; So distant art Thou—yet so nigh. Remains but this when all is said For Thee to live; in Thee to die. X. FESTUM SS. TRINITATIS. Like some broad flood whose conquering course Shakes the dim forests night and day On sweeps the prime Creative Force, And re-creates the worlds alway. The eternal Mind, the sole-born Thought Shape-entering matter's stamp and mould, Through all the spaces wonder-fraught Speaks Law and Order as of old. That Love which, ere it overflowed And beat on lone Creation's shore Issuing from Both with Both abode Proceeds, abides, for evermore. Yet man who—not in brow or breast But soul, and reason, and free-will— Imaged his Maker and expressed Ignored that Triune Mystery still! Here failed his science, failed as sight Earth's motion fails to mark! Ah me! Our eye can track the swallow's flight; The circling sphere it cannot see! And yet as Sense, abashed, down kneels And wins from Science lore sublime To kneeling science Faith reveals Mysteries transcending space and time. The Infinite remains unknown Too vast for man to understand: In Him, the ‘Woman's Seed,’ alone We trace God's footprint in the sand. XI. THRONUS TRINITATIS. Each several Saint the Church reveres, What is he but an altar whence Some separate Virtue ministers To God a separate frankincense? Each beyond each, not made of hands They rise, a ladder angel-trod: Star-bright the last and loftiest stands: That altar is the Throne of God. Lost in the uncreated light A Form all Human rests thereon: His shade from that surpassing height Beyond Creation's verge is thrown. Him ‘Lord of lords, and King of kings,’ The chorus of all worlds proclaim: ‘He took from her,’ one angel sings At intervals, ‘His human frame.’ XII. REGINA SANCTORUM OMNIUM. He seemed to linger with them yet: But late ascended to the skies They saw—ah, how could they forget?— The form they loved, the hands, the eyes. From anchored boat, in lane or field He taught; He blessed, and brake the bread; The hungry filled; the afflicted healed; And wept, ere yet He raised, the dead. But when, like some supreme of hills Whose feet shut out its summit's snow That, hid no longer, heavenward swells As further from its base we go, Abroad His perfect Godhead shone Each hour more plainly kenned on high And clothed His Manhood with the sun And, lifting, cleansed the adoring eye; Then fixed His Church a deepening gaze Upon His Saints. With Him they sate And, burning in that Godhead's blaze, They seemed that Manhood to dilate. His were they: of His likeness each Had grace some fragment to present And nearer brought to mortal reach Some imitable lineament. XIII. ADVOCATA. I saw, in visions of the night Creation like a sea outspread With surf of stars and storm of light And movements manifold and dread. Then lo, within a Human Hand A Sceptre moved that storm above: Thereon, as on the golden wand Of kings new-crowned, there sat a Dove. Beneath her gracious weight inclined That Sceptre drooped. The waves had rest: And Sceptre, Hand, and Dove were shrined Within a glassy ocean's breast. His Will it was that placed her there! He at whose word the tempests cease Upon that Sceptre planted fair That peace-bestowing type of Peace! XIV. EXALTAVIT HUMILES. The Chief of Creatures lived unknown Sharing her Maker's sacred cloud Like some fair headland flower-bestrewn That sleeps within its sea-born shroud. The Brethren sought precedence: Christ To them gave titles. He, their God, For Him ‘the Son of Man’ sufficed: The hidden way with Him she trod. She died: the idols sank, and they Those four great Heresies, whose pride Successive blurred the fount of day Her Son's Divinity denied: As God, as Man, secure He reigned: Then came her hour: then shone her crown And theirs, that Saintly Court unstained While guests of earth, by earth's renown. Humility was crowned though late: That boastful, pagan greatness fell: And on their thrones the Meek ones sate ‘Judging the tribes of Israel.’ XV. Where is the crocus now that first When earth was dark and heaven was grey A prothalamion flash, up burst? Ah, then we thought not of the May! The clear stream stagnates in its course; Narcissus droops in pallid gloom; Far off the hills of golden gorse; A dusk Saturnian face assume. The seeded dandelion dim Casts loose its air-globe on the breeze; Along the grass the swallows skim; The cattle couch among the trees. Yet ever lordlier loveliness Succeeds the charm that cheats our hold: The thorn assumes her snowy dress; Laburnum bowers their robes of gold. Down waves successive of the year The season slides; but sinks to rise With ampler view, as on we steer, Of lovelier lights and loftier skies. XVI. A low ground-mist, the hills between Measuring their intervals, distends Ridge beyond ridge, the sylvan scene; Far off the reddening river bends From bridge to town. On hueless air The moon suspends her pearly shell Above the eastern ledges bare; But sunset throngs yon western dell That pants through amethystine mist And gleams as though the Sons of God Through golden ether stooped, and kissed Some Syrian vale the Saviour trod! The beatific Splendours wane: The hills, of all that sweetness gone, A roseate memory still retain: Thou compline chime, peal on, peal on! Of Him thou sing'st whose Blood erased Earth's ancient stain by power divine; Of them, that second Pair, who paced That second Eden, Palestine. XVII. IN CIVITATE SANCTIFICATA REQUIEVI. In silence, like a ridge of snows Slow reared in lands for ever calm, On Sion's brow the Temple rose; In stillness grew as grows the palm. Far off, on ridges vapour-draped, Was hewn and carved each destined stone: Far off the axe the cedars shaped Upon their native Lebanon. So rose that Temple holier far Incarnate Godhead's sacred shrine: Round her there swelled no din of war: The peace that girt her was divine. The deep foundations of that fane Were laid ere lived the hills and seas In many a dread, unquarried vein Of God's deep Will, and fixed Decrees. High Queen of Peace! Her God possessed, Her heart could feel no earthly want: His kingdom, 'stablished in her breast, Triumphant was, not militant: And day by day more amply played His love about its raptured thrall Like some eternal sunset stayed On cliff rich-veined, or mountain wall. XVIII. QUASI CEDRUS EXALTATA SUM IN LIBANO. Ecclesiasticus xxiv. Behold! I sought in all things rest: My Maker called me: I obeyed: On me He laid His great behest: In me His tabernacle made. The world's Creator thus bespake ‘My Salem be thy heritage: Thy rest within mine Israel make: In Sion root thee, age by age.’ Within the City well-beloved Thenceforth I grew from flower to fruit: And in an ancient race approved Behold thenceforth I struck my root. Like Carmel's cedar, or the palm That gladdens 'mid Engaddi's dew Or Plane-tree set by waters calm I stood, and round my fragrance threw. Behold! I live where dwells not sin: I breathe in climes no foulness taints: I reign in God's fair Court, and in The full assembly of His Saints. XIX. SAPIENTIA. Ecclesiasticus xxiv. My flowers are flowers of gladness: mine The boughs of honour and of grace: Pure as the first bud of the vine My fragrance freshens all the place. The Mother of fair Love am I: With me is Wisdom's name and praise: With me are Hope, and Knowledge high, And sacred Fear, and peaceful days. Through garden plots my course I took To bathe the beds of herb and tree: Then to a river swelled my brook: Anon that river was a sea. More high that sea shall rise and shine Far off, a prophet-beam of morn; Because my doctrine is not mine But light of God for Seers unborn. XX. BEATI MITES. Thy song is not the song of morn O thrush, but calmer and more strong; While sunset woods around thee burn And echoing stems thy strain prolong. O songstress of the thorn whereon As yet the white but streaks the green Sing on! sing on! Thou sing'st as one That sings of what his eyes have seen! In thee some Seraph's rapture tells Of joys we guess not! Heaven draws near: I hear the immortal City's bells: The triumph of the Blest I hear. The whole wide earth, to God heart-bare Basks like some happy Umbrian vale By Francis trodden and by Clare When anthems sweetened every gale When Greatness thirsted to be good When faith was meek and love was brave When hope by every cradle stood And rainbows spanned each new-made grave. XXI. SINE LABE ORIGINALI CONCEPTA. Her foot is on the Lord of Night: On Heaven, not him, are fixed her eyes: That foot is, as a lily, light; Not less that Serpent writhes and dies! O Eve, he dies, that tempter fell! O Earth, that pest whose poison-spume Exasperate with the fires of hell Thy blood envenomed, meets his doom! But whence the conquering puissance? Lo! That Woman clasps the ‘Woman's Seed:’ That Infant quells the infernal foe: Messiah triumphs: His the deed! The weight she feels not she transmits: The weight of worlds her arms sustain: Who made the worlds—in heaven Who sits— Through her that foe hath touched and slain! XXII. SINE LABE ORIGINALI CONCEPTA. Could she, that Destined One, could she On whom His gaze was stayed for aye Transgress like Eve, partake that Tree Become, like her, the Dragon's prey? Had He no Pythian shaft that hour Her Son—her God—to pierce that Foe Which strove her greatness to devour, Eclipse her glories? Deem not so! He saw her in that First Decree: He saw the Assailant; sent the aid:— Filial it was, His love for thee Ere thou wert born; ere worlds were made. XXIII. SINE LABE ORIGINALI CONCEPTA. When man gives up the ghost, behold, Honouring his God's Decree august His body melts: the mortal mould Revisiteth its native dust. The bulwarks of the breast give way: Those eyes that glorying watched the sun: Each atom-speck of mortal clay Foregoes its nature—all save one. A something—germ or power—survives, That seed which linked, from birth to death, The structure's myriad cyclic lives That remnant never perisheth! That seed reserved, too fine, too small For eye to scan, for chance to mar Shall soar to meet God's trumpet-call, Re-clad, and glittering like a star. With Man so fared it at the Fall: The Race lay dead: She did not die: One seed survived—the hope of all— Thy pledge, Redeemed Humanity! XXIV. SINE LABE ORIGINALI CONCEPTA. Met in a point The Incarnation. the circles twain Of temporal and eternal things Embrace, close linked. Redemption's chain Drops thence to earth its myriad rings. In either circle, from of old That point of meeting stood decreed; Twin mysteries cast in one deep mould ‘The Woman,’ and ‘the Woman's Seed.’ Mary, long ages ere thy birth Resplendent with Salvation's Sign In thee a stainless hand the earth Put forth, to meet the Hand Divine! The Word made Flesh; the Way; the Door; The link that dust with Godhead blends! Through Him the worlds their God adore: Through thee that God to man descends. XXV. SINE LABE ORIGINALI CONCEPTA. A soul-like sound, subdued yet strong, A whispered music, mystery-rife, A sound like Eden airs among The branches of the Tree of Life— At first no more than this; at last The voice of every land and clime It swept o'er Earth a clarion blast: Earth heard, and shook with joy sublime. Mary! thy triumph was Earth's own! In thee she saw her prime restored: She saw ascend a spotless Throne For Him, her Saviour, and her Lord. First trophy of all-conquering Grace First victory of that Blood all pure Of man's once fair, but fallen Race, Thou stood'st, the monument secure. The Church had spoken. She that dwells Sun-clad with beatific light, From Truth's uncounted citadels From Sion's Apostolic height Had stretched her sceptred hands, and pressed The seal of Faith, defined and known, Upon that Truth till then confessed By Love's instinctive sense alone. XXVI. FREMUERUNT GENTES. The sordid World, insane through pride Masking her sin in virtue's name Rejects, usurps, self-deified, The Immaculate Mother's sacred claim. ‘The Earth is mine, and Earth's desires: My Science reigns from zone to zone: I warm my hands o'er Nature's fires; I reap the fields those hands have sown: ‘From depths unknown I crept unseen Through worm and beast to Man's estate: My hands are clean: I rule, a Queen Immortal and Immaculate.’ Thus boasteth Pride with brazen brow; That Pride which still ‘believes a lie’:— The counter-boast of Grace art thou, Immaculate Humility! Therefore, like Western hill that flings O'er sunset vales its gradual shade Thy power shall wax while sensuous things Dissolve, and earthly grandeurs fade. In the world's eve thy Star shall flash Through reddening skies that cease to weep While kings to earth their sceptres dash And angel bands the harvest reap. XXVII. THE RAINBOW. All-glorious shape that fleet'st wind-swept Athwart the empurpled pine-girt steep, That, sinless, from thy birth hast wept, All-gladdening, till thy death must weep; That in eterne ablution still Thine innocence in shame dost shroud And, washed where stain was none, dost fill With light thy penitential cloud; Illume with peace our glooming glen O'er-arch with hope yon distant sea To angels whispering and to men Of her whose lowlier sanctity In God's all-cleansing freshness shrined Renounced all pureness of her own, And aye her lucent brow inclined God's ‘Handmaid’ meek, before His throne. XXVIII. ANCILLA DOMINI. The crown of Creatures, first in place, Was, of all creatures, creature most: By nature nothing; all by grace; Redemption's first and loftiest boast. Handmaid of God in heart and will Without His life she seemed a death A void that He alone could fill A word suspended on His breath. Yet—void and nothing—she in Him The Creature's sole perfection found; She was the great Rock's shadow dim; She was the silence not the sound. On golden airs, by Him upheld, She knelt, a soft Subjection mute A hushed Dependance, tranced and spelled, Still yearning towards the Absolute. She was a sea-shell from the deep Of God; her function this alone Of Him to whisper as in sleep, In everlasting undertone. This hour on Him her eyes are set! And those who tread the earth she trod Like her themselves in her forget And her remember but in God. XXIX. Brow-bound with myrtle and with gold Spring, sacred now from blasts and blights, Lifts high in firm, untrembling hold Her chalice of fulfilled delights. Confirmed around her queenly lip The smile late wavering, on she moves; And seems through deepening tides to step Of steadier joys and larger loves. The stony Ash itself relents, Into the blue embrace of May Sinking, like old impenitents Heart-touched at last; and, far away, The long wave yearns along the coast With sob suppressed, like that which thrills, Whilst o'er the altar mounts the Host, Some chapel on the Irish hills. XXX. CORPUS CHRISTI. Rejoice, thou Church of God! be glad, This day triumphant here below! He cometh, in lowliest emblems clad; Himself He cometh to bestow! That Body which thou gav'st, O Earth He gives thee back—that Flesh, that Blood— Born of the Altar's mystic birth; At once thy Worship and thy Food. He who of old on Calvary bled On all thine altars lies to-day A bloodless Sacrifice, but dread The Lamb in heaven adored for aye. His Godhead on the Cross He veiled; His Manhood here He veileth too: But Faith has eagle eyes unscaled, And Love to Him she loves is true. ‘I will not leave you orphans. Lo! While lasts the world with you am I.’ Saviour! we see Thee not; but know With burning hearts that Thou art nigh! He cometh! Blue Heaven, thine incense breathe O'er all the consecrated sod; And thou, O Earth, with flowers enwreathe The steps of thine advancing God! XXXI. CORPUS CHRISTI. What music swells on every gale? What heavenly Herald speedeth past? Vale sings to vale, ‘He comes; all hail!’ Sea sobs to sea, ‘He comes at last.’ The Earth bursts forth in choral song; Aloft her ‘Lauda Sion’ soars; Her myrtle boughs at once are flung Before a thousand Minster doors. Far on the white processions wind Through wood and plain and street and court: The kings and prelates pace behind The King of kings in seemly sort. The incense floats on Grecian air Old Carmel echoes Calpè's chant, In every breeze the torches flare That curls the waves of the Levant. On Ramah's plain in Bethlehem's bound Is heard to-day a gladsome voice: ‘Rejoice,’ it cries, ‘the Lost is found! With Mary's joy, O Earth, rejoice!’ XXXII. THE TWO LAST GIFTS. ‘Behold thy Mother!’ From the Cross He gave her—not to one alone: We are His Brethren; unto us He gave a Mother as to John. Behold the greatest gift of Christ Save that wherein Himself He gives, The wonder-working Eucharist, Sole life of each that truly lives: Mysterious Bread not joined and knit With him that eats, like mortal food, But, fire-like, joining him with It And blending with the Church of God! Mary! from thee the Saviour took That Flesh He gives! The mercies twain Like streams of a divided brook But separate to meet again. XXXIII. DOMUS AUREA. ‘Wisdom hath built herself a House, And hewn her out her pillars seven:’ Proverbs ix. 1. Her wine is mixed: her guests are those Who share the harvest-home of heaven. The fruits upon her table piled Are gathered from the Tree of Life: Around are ranged the undefiled, And those that conquered in the strife. Who tends the guests? Who smiles away Sad memories? bids misgiving cease? A crowned one countenanced like the day The Mother of the Prince of Peace! XXXIV. Pleasant the swarm about the bough; The meadow-whisper round the woods; And for their coolness pleasant now The murmur of the falling floods. Pleasant beneath the thorn to lie And let a summer fancy loose; To hear the cuckoo's double cry; To make the noontide sloth's excuse. Panting, but pleased, the cattle stand Knee-deep in water-weed and sedge And scarcely crop that greener band Of osiers round the river's edge. But hark! Far off the south wind sweeps The golden-foliaged groves among Renewed or lulled, with rests and leaps— Ah! how it makes the spirit long To drop its earthly weight and drift Like yon white cloud, on pinions free Beyond that Mountain's purple rift And o'er that scintillating sea! XXXV. FEST. ASSUMPTIONIS. The mother of the heavenly Child Who made the worlds, and who redeemed, The maid and mother undefiled She died: or else to die she seemed. Once more above the late-entombed They bent. What found they? Vacant space: To heaven had Mary been assumed And only flowers were in the place. O happy earth! Elected sphere! Hope of that starry host above! Thou too thy Maker's voice shalt hear; Thou too thy great Assumption prove! The earth shall be renewed: the skies Shall bloom with glories unrevealed: Each season new but typifies The wonders then to be unsealed. Revives, each spring, a world that died: A world by summer's store increased Shall hear ere long that mandate wide ‘Prepare the glad Assumption Feast!’ XXXVI. ELIAS AND ENOCH. O thou that rodest up the skies, Assumed ere death, on steeds of fire That, rapt from earth in mortal guise Some air immortal dost respire; That, ambushed in the enshrouding sheen, In quiet lulled of soul and flesh, With one great thought of Him, the Unseen, Thy ceaseless vigil dost refresh; Old lion of Carmelian steeps! Upon God's mountain, where, O where, Or couchant by His unknown deeps, Mak'st thou thine everlasting lair? Hast thou, that earlier Seer beside Who ‘walked with God, and was not,’ him By contemplation glorified When faith, in shallower hearts, grew dim, Hast thou—despite corporeal bars— A place among those Hierarchies, Who fix on Mary's Throne, like stars, The light of never-closing eyes? Behold, there is a debt to pay! With Enoch hid thou art on high: Yet both shall back return one day, To gaze once more on earth, and die. XXXVII. FEST. DE MONTE CARMELO. Carmel, with Alp and Apennine Low whispers in the wind that blows Beneath the Eastern stars, ere shine The lights of morning on their snows. Of thee, Elias, Carmel speaks, And that white cloud so small at first Her Type, that neared the mountain peaks To quench a dying nation's thirst. On Carmel like a sheathed sword Thy monks abode till Jesus came; On Carmel then they served their Lord; Then Carmel rang with Mary's name. Blow over all the garden; blow O'er all God's garden of the West Balm-breathing Orient! Whisper low The secret of thy spicy nest! ‘Who from the Desert upward moves Like cloud of incense onward borne? Who moving, rests on Him she loves? Who mounts from regions of the Morn? ‘Behold! The apple-tree beneath— There where of old thy Mother fell, I raised thee up. More strong than Death Is Love; more strong than Death or Hell.’ Cant. viii. 5, iii. 6. XXXVIII. VAS SPIRITUALE. High, wingèd Heart, and crowned with fire! O winged with pinions of the morn O crowned with flames whose every spire Bears witness to that crown of thorn! Fair Dove of God, that, still at rest, On speed'st in never wavering flight Winging the illimitable Breast— The Omnipresent Infinite; We stagnate as in seas of lead, Ice-cold, or warmed with earthly fires: O that like thine our souls were fed With sun-like yet serene desires! A vase of quenchless love thou art Drawn from that boundless Breast divine:— O that in thee, on-rushing Heart, Might rest, one hour, this heart of mine! XXXIX. Sing on, wide winds, your anthem vast! Man's ear is richer than his eye: Upon the eye no shape can cast Such impress of Infinity. And thou, my Soul, thy wings of might Put forth: thou too, one day shalt soar And, onward borne in heavenward flight, The starry universe explore; Breasting that breeze which waves the bowers Of Heaven's bright forest never mute Whereof perchance this earth of ours Is but the feeblest forest-fruit. Of all those worlds unnumbered none There lives but from that Blood all pure Ablution, or its crown, hath won; Its state redeemed, or state secure. ‘The Spirit bloweth where He wills’— O Effluence of that Life Divine Which wakes the Universe, and stills, In Thy strong refluence make us Thine! XL. CŒLI ENARRANT. Sole Maker of the Worlds! They lay A barren blank a void a nought Beyond the ken of solar ray Or reach of archangelic thought. Thou spak'st; and they were made! Forth sprang From every region of the abyss Whose deeps, fire-clov'n, with anthems rang, The spheres new-born and numberless. Thou spak'st: upon the winds were found The astonished Eagles. Awed and hushed Subsiding seas revered their bound; And the strong forests upward rushed. Before that Vision angels fell As though the Face of God they saw; And all the panting Miracle Found rest within the arms of Law. Perfect, O God, Thy primal plan, That scheme frost-bound by Adam's sin: Create, within the heart of Man, Worlds meet for Thee; and dwell therein. From Thy bright realm of Sense and Nature Which flowers enwreathe and stars begem, Shape Thou Thy Church; the crownèd Creature; The Bride; the New Jerusalem! XLI. CARO FACTUS EST. When from beneath the Almighty Hand The suns and systems rushed abroad Like coursers which have burst their band Or torrents when the ice is thawed; When round in luminous orbits flung The great stars gloried in their might; Still, still a bridgeless gulf there hung 'Twixt Finite things and Infinite. That crown of light Creation wore Was girdled by the abysmal black; And all of natural good she bore Confessed her supernatural lack. For what is Nature at the best? An arch suspended in its spring; An altar step without a priest; A throne whereon there sits no king. As one stone-blind that fronts the morn The World before her Maker stood Uplifting suppliant hands forlorn, God's creature yet how far from God! O Shepherd Good! The trackless deep He pierced, that Lost One to restore! His Universe, a wildered sheep, Upon His shoulder home He bore! That Universe His Priestly robe, The Kingly Pontiff raised on high The worship of the starry globe:— The gulf was bridged, and God was nigh. XLII. CONDESCENSIO. When was it that in act began That Condescension from on high Consummated in God made Man, Its shrine for all eternity? 'Twas when the Eternal Father spake, The Eternal Son in act replied: When sudden forth from darkness brake The new-shaped worlds on every side. Instant that All-Creative Power A meek, sustaining Power became, A Ministration hour by hour From death preserving Nature's frame. Instant into Creation's breast Nor merged nor mixed He passed, and gave Continuance to the quivering guest That else had found at birth its grave. In finite mansions He, the Immense, In service reigning, made abode, Bore up—a Law, a Providence— The weight of worlds, ‘His people's load.’ He came once more—not then to reign; In servant's form to serve, and die The ‘Lamb before the ages slain,’ ‘The Woman's Seed’ of prophecy. XLIII. THE CREATED WISDOM. Proverbs viii. 27—34. Created Wisdom at the gate Of Heaven's eternal House, I played: The Eternal Wisdom Uncreate Beheld me ere the worlds were made. I danced the void abyss above: Of lore unwrit the characters I traced with wingèd feet, and wove The orbits of the unshaped stars. I flashed—a Thought in light arrayed— Beneath the Eternal Wisdom's ken: When came mine hour I lived, and played Among the peopled fields of men. Blessed is he that keeps my ways, That stands in reverence on my floor, That seeks my praise, my word obeys, That waits and watches by my door. XLIV. REGINA ANGELORUM.(Evangelism in Cœla.) Ere yet mankind was made; ere yet The sun and she that rules the night Were in their heavenly stations set, God's Sons were playing in His sight. Age after age those armies vast In winding line had upward flown Yet ne'er their shadows higher cast Than on the first step of the Throne And downward through the unsounded space If those had sunk who soared above They ne'er had found the buried base Of Godhead's Condescending Love. Then He, the God Who made them, proved: For, high and higher as they soared Hymning the Eternal Son beloved The God from God, and Lord from Lord, He showed them, in that Form decreed, Their God made man—man's hope and trust— ‘The Woman, ’and ‘The Woman's Seed,’ He showed; the Unbounded bound in dust. As when from some world-conquering height The shepherd sees, ere risen the sun, His advent clothe the cloud with light Before them thus that Vision shone: And while, in wonder half half fear, That Child, that Mother fixed their eye, He bade those heavenward hosts revere Their God in His Humility. Set was that Infant as a sign:— In endless bliss confirmed were they Who hailed that hour the Babe Divine; Self-sentenced those who turned away. XLV. REGINA ANGELORUM.(Spes Cœlestis.) Their Trial past, more near the Throne, And rapt thenceforth to holier skies, Still on that Maid and Babe foreshown The Elect of Angels fixed their eyes. A Spirit-galaxy they hung; A Cross unmeasured, limned in fire And instinct-shaped, that swayed and swung On winds of unfulfilled desire. They worshipped Him, that God made Man; To Him they spread their hands in power: Unmarked the exhausted centuries ran: That trance millennial seemed an hour. 'Twixt Finite things and Infinite They saw the Patriarch's Ladder thrown; Saw One Who o'er it moved in light: They saw, and knelt with foreheads prone. Make answer, sinless Angels, say Ye who that hour your God adored Less strong, less dear, is she this day, That Mother of your destined Lord? XLVI. REGINA ANGELORUM.(In Cœlo Coronata.) Angelic City in the skies Not built of stones but Spirits pure Irradiate by the Eternal Eyes, And in the Eternal Love secure; Angelic City, selfless chaste By Him thou watch'st upholden still, That neither Future know'st, nor Past Tranced in thy God's all-present Will; Thy mind a mirror sphered of gold Wherein alone His splendours shine; Thy heart a vase His Hand doth hold That yields to Him alone its wine; For one brief moment proved and tried; Thenceforth man's help in trial's stress; Bright Sister of the Church—the Bride— The elder Sister, yet the less: O like, unlike! O crownèd Twain! Celestial both, yet one terrene; Behold, ye sing the same glad strain; Ye glory in the self-same Queen! XLVII. MULIER AMICTA SOLE. A Woman ‘clothèd with the sun,’ Rev. xii. 1. Yet fleeing from the Dragon's rage! The strife in Eden-bowers begun Swells upward to the latest age. That Woman's Son is throned on high; ‘And her Child was caught up unto God, and to His Throne’ (Apoc. xiv. 5). The angelic hosts before Him bend: The sceptre of His empery Subdues the worlds from end to end. Yet still the sword goes through her heart For still on earth His Church survives: In her that Woman holds a part: In her she suffers, and she strives. Around her head the stars are set; A dying moon beneath her wanes: By Death hath Death been slain: and yet The Power accurst awhile remains. Break up, strong Earth, thy stony floors And snatch to penal caverns dun That Dragon from the pit that wars Against the Woman and her Son! XLVIII. Regent of Change, thou waning Moon Whom they, the sons of night, adore Her foot is on thee! Late or soon Heap up upon the expectant shore The tides of Man's Intelligence; Or backward to the blackening deep Remit them! Knowledge won from Sense But sleeps to wake and wakes to sleep. Where are the hands that reared on high Heaven-threat'ning Babel? where the might Of them, that giant progeny The Deluge dealt with? Lost in night. The child who knows his creed doth stretch A sceptred hand o'er Space and hold The end of all those threads that catch In wisdom's net the starry fold. The Sabbath comes: the work-days six Go by. Meantime, of things to be O Salutary Crucifix We clasp the burning heart in thee: We clasp the end that knows no end; The Love that fears no lessening moon; The Truth wherein all mysteries blend; His Truth, His word—the One Triune. XLIX. OTHER SHEEP I HAVE. Fire-breathing concourse of the Stars That tremble as with Love's delight How dungeon-girt by custom's bars How wrapped and swathed in error's night His soul must be who nightly lifts On you his wide and wandering eyes Yet doubts that ye partake the gifts Bequeathed by Calvary's Sacrifice! Lift up your heads, Eternal Gates Of God's great Temple in the sky! That Blood your lintels consecrates:— The Avenging Angel passes by! The King of Glory issues forth: The King of Glory enters in: That Blood which cleansed from sin our earth Or cleansed your spheres, or kept from sin. L. Is this, indeed, our ancient earth? Or have we died in sleep and risen? Has earth, like man, her second birth? Rises the palace from the prison? Hills beyond hills ascend the skies; O'er winding valleys heaven-suspended, Huge forests rich as sunset's dyes With rainbow-braided clouds are blended. What means it? Glory, sweetness, might? Not these but something holier far; Shadows of Him, that Light of Light Whose priestly vestment all things are. The veil of sense transparent grows: God's Face shines out that veil behind Like yonder sea-reflected snows— Here man must worship, or be blind. LI. No ray of all their silken sheen The leaves first fledged have lost as yet: Unfaded, near the advancing queen Of flowers, abides the violet. The rose succeeds; her month is come; The flower with sacred passion red: She sings the praise of martyrdom And Him for whom His martyrs bled. The perfect work of May is done: Hard by, a new perfection waits: The twain, a sister and a nun, A moment parley at the grates. The whiter Spirit turns in peace To hide her in the cloistral shade: 'Tis time that you should also cease, Slight carols in her honour made. EPILOGUE. THE SON OF MAN. I gazed—it was the Paschal night— In vision on the starry sphere: Like suns the stars made broad their light: Then knew I Earth to Heaven drew near. The Thrones of Darkness down were hurled; The veil was rent; the bond was riven: Then knew I that Man's little world Had reached its home—the heart of heaven. Made strong by God, mine eyes with awe Still roved from star-changed sun to sun That ringed the earth in ranks, and saw A Spirit o'er each, that stood thereon. And, clasped by every Spirit, stood More high, the Venerable Sign: Then knew I that the Atoning Blood Had reached that sphere; the Blood Divine. From orb to orb an anthem passed; ‘The Blessing of the Lord of All Hath reached us from the least and last Of stars that light the Heavenly Hall; ‘For He, that Greatest, loves the Least; Puts down the mighty; lifts the low: On Earth began His Bridal Feast: Our Triumph is its overflow!’ Then Earth, that great ‘New Earth’ ‘There shall be New Heavens, and a New Earth.’ foretold, Assumed those glories long her due: Or were they hers indeed of old Though veiled till then from mortal view? While—with her changing—far and wide Those worlds around her, blent in one, Became that ‘City of the Bride’ Which needs no light of moon or sun. Their splendour had not suffered change As, kenned through myriad senses new, Self-radiant street, and columned range To one unmeasured Temple grew. Ere long through all that throbbing frame Of things beheld and things unseen Rolled forth that Name which none can name Save those that breathe not clime terrene. And down that luminous Infinite I saw an Altar and a Throne; And, near to each, a Form, all light That, resting, moved, and moved Alone: But if He filled that Throne or knelt That Altar nigh, or Lamb-like lay, I saw not. This I saw and felt That Son of Man was God for aye. That Son of God was Man and stood, And from His Vest, more white than snow, Slowly there dawned a Cross of Blood That through the glory seemed to grow: Above the heavens His Hands He raised To bless those Worlds whose race was run; And lo! in either palm there blazed The blood-red sign of Victory won; That Blood the Bethlehem Shepherds eyed Warming His cheek Who slept apart: That Blood He drew—the Crucified— Far-fountained from His Mother's Heart. LEGENDS OF THE SAXON SAINTS. TO THE VENERABLE BEDE 'Mid quiet vale or city lulled by night Well-pleased the wanderer, wakeful on his bed, Hears from far Alps on fitful breeze the sound Of torrents murmuring down their rocky glens, Strange voice from distant regions, alien climes:— Should these far echoes from thy legend-roll Delight of loftier years, these echoes faint, Thus waken, thus make calm, one restless heart In our distempered day, to thee the praise Voice of past times O Venerable Bede! PROLOGUE. ODIN THE MAN. Odin, a Prince who reigned near the Caspian Sea, after a vain resistance to the Roman arms, leads forth his people to the forests north of the Danube, that, serving God in freedom on the limits of the Roman Empire, and being strengthened by an adverse climate, they may one day descend upon that empire in just revenge; which destiny was fulfilled by the sack of Rome, under Alaric, Christian King of the Goths, a race derived, like the Saxon, from that Eastern people. Forth with those missives, Chiron, to the Invader! Hence, and make speed: they scathe mine eyes like fire: Pompeius, thou hast conquered! What remains? Vengeance! Man's race has never dreamed of such; So slow, so sure. Pompeius, I depart: I might have held these mountains yet four days: The fifth had seen them thine— I look beyond the limit of this night: Four centuries I need; then comes mine hour. What saith the Accursed One of the Western World? I hear even now her trumpet! Thus she saith: ‘I have enlarged my borders: iron reaped Earth's field all golden. Strenuous fight we fought: I left some sweat drops on that Carthage shore, Some blood on Gallic javelins. That is past! My pleasant days are come: my couch is spread Beside all waters of the Midland Sea; By whispers lulled of nations kneeling round; Illumed by light of balmiest climes; refreshed By winds from Atlas and the Olympian snows: Henceforth my foot is in delicious ways; Bathe it, ye Persian fountains! Syrian vales, All roses, make me sleepy with perfumes! Caucasian cliffs, with martial echoes faint Flatter light slumbers; charm a Roman dream! I send you my Pompeius; let him lead Odin in chains to Rome!’ Odin in chains! Were Odin chained, or dead, that God he serves Could raise a thousand Odins— Rome's Founder-King beside his Augur standing Noted twelve ravens borne in sequent flight O'er Alba's crags. They emblem'd centuries twelve, The term to Rome conceded. Eight are flown; Remain but four. Hail, sacred brood of night! Hencefore my standards bear the Raven Sign, The bird that hoarsely haunts the ruined tower; The bird sagacious of the field of blood Albeit far off. Four centuries I need: Then comes my day. My race and I are one. O Race beloved and holy! From my youth Where'er a hungry heart impelled my feet, Whate'er I found of glorious, have I not Claimed it for thee, deep-musing? Ignorant, first, For thee I wished the golden ingots piled In Susa and Ecbatana:—ah fool! At Athens next, treading where Plato trod, For thee all triumphs of the mind of man, And Phidian hand inspired! Ah fool, that hour Athens lay bound, a slave! Later to Rome In secrecy by Mithridates sent To search the inmost of his hated foe, For thee I claimed that discipline of Law Which made her State one camp. Fool, fool once more! Soon learned I what a heart-pollution lurked Beneath that mask of Law. As Persia fell, By softness sapped, so Rome. Behold, this day, Following the Pole Star of my just revenge, I lead my people forth to clearer fates Through cloudier fortunes. They are brave and strong: 'Tis but the rose-breath of their vale that rots Their destiny's bud unblown. I lead them forth, A race war-vanquished, not a race of slaves; Lead them, not southward to Euphrates' bank, Not Eastward to the realms of rising suns, Nor West to Rome, and bondage. Hail, thou North! Hail, boundless woods, by nameless oceans girt, And snow-robed mountain islets, founts of fire! Four hundred years! I know that awful North: I sought it when the one flower of my life Fell to my foot. That anguish set me free: It dashed me on the iron side of life: I woke, a man. My people too shall wake: They shall have icy crags for myrtle banks, Sharp rocks for couches. Strength! I must have strength; Not splenetic sallies of a woman's courage, But hearts to which self-pity is unknown: Hard life to them must be as mighty wine Gladdening the strong: the death on battle-fields Must seem the natural, honest close of life; Their fear must be to die without a wound And miss Life's after-banquet. Wooden shield Whole winter nights shall lie their covering sole: Thereon the boy shall stem the ocean wave; Thereon the youth shall slide with speed of winds Loud-laughing down the snowy mountain-slope: To him the Sire shall whisper as he bleeds, ‘Remember the revenge! Thy son must prove More strong, more hard than thou!’ Four hundred years! Increase is tardy in that icy clime, For Death is there the awful nurse of Life: Death rocks the cot. Why meet we there no wolf Save those huge-limbed? Because weak wolf-cubs die. 'Tis thus with man; 'tis thus with all things strong:— Rise higher on thy northern hills, my Pine! That Southern Palm shall dwindle. House stone-walled— Ye shall not have it! Temples cedar-roofed— Ye shall not build them! Where the Temple stands The City gathers. Cities ye shall spurn: Live in the woods; live singly, winning each, Hunter or fisher by blue lakes, his prey: Abhor the gilded shrine: the God Unknown In such abides not. On the mountain's top Great Persia sought Him in her day of strength: With her ye share the kingly breed of Truths, The noblest inspirations man hath known, Or can know—ay, unless the Lord of all Should come, Man's Teacher. Pray as Persia prayed; And see ye pray for Vengeance! Leave till then To Rome her Idol fanes and pilfered Gods. I see you, O my People, year by year Strengthened by sufferings; pains that crush the weak, Your helpers. Men have been that, poison-fed, Grew poison-proof: on pain and wrong feed ye! The wild-beast rage against you! frost and fire Rack you in turn! I'll have no gold among you; With gold come wants; and wants mean servitude. Edge, each, his spear with fish-bone or with flint, Leaning for prop on none. I want no Nations! A Race I fashion, playing not at States: I take the race of Man, the breed that lifts Alone its brow to heaven: I change that race From clay to stone, from stone to adamant Through slow abrasion, such as leaves sea-shelves Lustrous at last and smooth. To be, not have, A man to be; no heritage to clasp Save that which simple manhood, at its will, Or conquers or re-conquers, held meanwhile In trust for Virtue; this alone is greatness. Remain ye Tribes, not Nations; led by Kings, Great onward-striding Kings, above the rest High towering, like the keel-compelling sail That takes the topmost tempest. Let them die, Each for his people! I will die for mine Then when my work is finished; not before. That Bandit King who founded Rome, the Accursed, Vanished in storm. My sons shall see me die, Die, strong to lead them till my latest breath, Which shall not be a sigh; shall see and say, ‘This Man far-marching through the mountainous world, No God, but yet God's Prophet of the North, Gave many crowns to others: for himself His people were his crown.’ Four hundred years— Ye shall find savage races in your path: Be ye barbaric, ay, but savage not: Hew down the baser lest they drag you down; Ye cannot raise them: they fulfil their fates: Be terrible to foes, be kind to friend: Be just; be true. Revere the Household Hearth; This knowing, that beside it dwells a God: Revere the Priest, the King, the Bard, the Maid, The Mother of the heroic race—five strings Sounding God's Lyre. Drive out with lance for goad That idiot God by Rome called Terminus, Who standing sleeps, and holds his reign o'er fools. The earth is God's, not Man's: that Man from Him Holds it whose valour earns it. Time shall come, It may be, when the warfare shall be past, The reign triumphant of the brave and just In peace consolidated. Time may come When that long winter of the Northern Land Shall find its spring. Where spreads the black morass Harvest all gold may glitter; cities rise Where roamed the elk; and nations set their thrones; Nations not like those empires known till now, But wise and pure. Let such their temples build And worship Truth, if Truth should e'er to Man Show her full face. Let such ordain them laws If Justice e'er should mate with laws of men. Above the mountain summits of Man's hope There spreads, I know, a land illimitable, The table land of Virtue trial-proved, Whereon one day the nations of the world Shall race like emulous Gods. A greater God Served by our sires, a God unknown to Rome, Above that shining level sits, high-towered: Millions of Spirits wing His flaming light, And fiery winds among His tresses play: When comes that hour which judges Gods and men That God shall plague the Gods that filched His name And cleanse the Peoples. When ye hear, my sons, That God uprising in His judgment robes And see their dreadful crimson in the West, Then know ye that the knell of Rome is nigh Then stand, and listen! When His Trumpet sounds Forth from your forests and your snows, my sons, Forth over Ister, Rhenus, Rhodonus, To Mœsia forth, to Thrace, Illyricum, Iberia, Gaul; but, most of all, to Rome! Who leads you thither leads you not for spoil: A mission hath he, fair though terrible; He makes a pure hand purer, washed in blood: On, Scourge of God! the Vengeance Hour is come. I know that hour, and wait it. Odin's work Stands then consummate. Odin's name thenceforth Goes down to darkness. Farewell, Ararat! How many an evening, still and bright as this, In childhood, youth, or manhood's sorrowing years, Have I not watched the sunset hanging red Upon thy hoary brow! Farewell for ever! A legend haunts thee that the race of man In earliest days, a sad and storm-tossed few, From thy wan heights descended making way Into a ruined world. A storm-tossed race, But not self-pitying, once again thou seest Into a world all ruin making way Whither they know not, yet without a fear. This hour—lo, there, they pass yon valley's verge!— In sable weeds that pilgrimage moves on, Moves slowly like thy shadow, Ararat, That eastward creeps. Phantom of glory dead! Image of greatness that disdains to die Move Northward thou! Whate'er thy fates decreed At least that shadow shall be shadow of Man, And not of beast gold-weighted! On, thou Night Cast by my heart! Thou too shalt meet thy morn! KING ETHELBERT OF KENT AND SAINT AUGUSTINE. Ethelbert, King of Kent, converses first with his Pagan Thanes, and next with Saint Augustine, newly landed on the shores of Thanet Island. The Saint, coming in sight of Canterbury, rejoices greatly, and predicts the future greatness of that city. Far through the forest depths of Thanet Isle That never yet had heard the woodman's axe, Rang the glad clarion on the May-day morn Blent with the cry of hounds. The rising sun Flamed on the forest's dewy jewelry, While, under rising mists, a host with plumes Rode down a broad oak alley t'wards the sea. King Ethelbert rode first: he reigned in Kent Least kingdom of the Seven yet Head of all Through his desert. That morn the royal train, While sang the invisible lark her song in heaven, Pursued the flying stag. At times the creature As though he too had pleasure in the sport, Vaulted at ease through sunshine and through shade, Then changed his mood, and left the best behind him. Five hours they chased him; last, upon a rock High up in scorn he held his antlered front, Then took the wave and vanished. Many a frown Darkened that hour on many a heated brow; And many a spur afflicted that poor flank Which panted hard and smoked. The King alone Laughed at mischance. ‘The stag, with God to aid, Has left our labour fruitless! Give him joy! He lives to yield us sport some later morn: So be it! Waits our feast, and not far off: On to the left 'twixt yonder ash and birch!’ He spake, and anger passed: they praised their sport; And many an outblown nostril seemed to snuff That promised feast. They rode through golden furze So high the horsemen only were descried; And glades whose centuried oaks their branches laid O'er violet banks; and fruit trees, some snow-veiled Like bridesmaid, others like the bride herself Behind her white veil blushing. Glad, the thrush Carolled; more glad, the wood-dove moaned; close by A warbling runnel led them to the bay: Two chestnuts stood beside it snowy-coned: The banquet lay beneath them. Feasting o'er The song succeeded. Boastful was the strain Each Thane his deeds extolling, or his sire's; But one, an aged man, among them scoffed: ‘When I was young; when Sigbert on my right To battle rode, and Sefred on my left; That time men stood not worsted by a stag! Not then our horses swerved from azure strait Scared by the ridged sea-wave!’ Next spake a chief, Pirate from Denmark late returned: ‘Our skies, Good friends, are all too soft to build the man! We fight for fame: the Northman fights for sport; Their annals boast they fled but once:—'twas thus: In days of old, when Rome was in her pride, Huge hosts of hers had fallen on theirs, surprised, And way-worn: long they fought: a remnant spent, Fled to their camp. Upon its walls their wives Stood up, black-garbed, with axes heaved aloft, And fell upon the fugitives and slew them; Slew next their little ones; slew last themselves, Cheating the Roman Triumph. Never since then Hath Northman fled the foemen.’ Egfrid rose: ‘Who saith our kinsfolk of the frozen North One stock with us, one faith, one ancient tongue Pass us in valour? Three days since I saw Crossing the East Saxon's border and our own Two boys that strove. The Kentish wounded fell; The East Saxon on him knelt; then made demand; “My victim art thou by the laws of war! Yonder my dagger lies;—till I return Wilt thou abide?” The vanquished answered, “Yea!” A minute more, and o'er that dagger's edge His life-blood rushed.’ The pirate chief demurred; ‘A gallant boy! Not less I wager this, The glitter of that dagger ere it smote Made his eye blink. Attend! Three years gone by, Sailing with Hakon on Norwegian fiords We fought the Jomsburg Rovers, at their head Sidroc, oath-pledged to marry Hakon's child Despite her father's best. In mist we met: Instant each navy at the other dashed Like wild beast, instinct-taught, This image will be found in the description of a Scandinavian sea-fight in a remarkable book less known than it deserves to be, The Invasion, by Gerald Griffin, author of The Collegians. The Saxons were, however, in early times as much pirates as the Danes were at a later. that knows its foe; Chained ship to ship, and clashed their clubs all day, Till sank the sun: then laughed the white peaks forth, And reeled, methought, above the reeling waves! The victory was with us. Hakon, next morn, Bade slay his prisoners. Thirty on one bench Waited their doom: their leader died the first; He winked not as the sword upon him closed! No, nor the second! Hakon asked the third “What think'st thou, friend, of Death?” He tossed his head: “My Father perished; I fulfil my turn.” The fourth, “Strike quickly, Chief! An hour this morn We held contention if, when heads are off The hand can hold its dagger: I would learn.” The dagger and the head together fell. The fifth, “One fear is mine—lest yonder slave Finger a Prince's hair! Command some chief Thy best beloved, to lift it in his hands; Then strike and spare not!” Hakon struck. That youth, Sigurd by name, his forehead forward twitched, Laughing, so deftly that the downward sword Shore off those luckless hands that raised his hair. All laughed; and Hakon's son besought his sire To loosen Sigurd's bonds: but Sigurd cried, “Unless the rest be loosed I will not live!” Thus all escaped save four.’ In graver mood That chief resumed: ‘A Norland King dies well! His bier is raised upon his stateliest ship; Piled with his arms; his lovers and his friends Rush to their monarch's pyre, resolved with him To share in death, and with becoming pomp Attend his footsteps to Valhalla's Hall. The torch is lit: forth sails the ship, black-winged, Facing the midnight seas. From beach and cliff Men watch all night that slowly lessening flame: Yet no man sheds a tear.’ Earconwald, An aged chief, made answer, ‘Tears there be Of divers sorts: a wise and valiant king Deserves that tear which praises, not bewails Greatness gone by.’ The pirate shouted loud ‘A land it is of laughter, not of tears! Know ye the tale of Harald? The achievement of Hastings had been rehearsed at a much earlier period by Harald. He had sailed Round southern coasts and eastern; sacked or burned A hundred Christian cities. One he found So girt with giant walls and brazen gates His sea-kings vainly dashed their ships against them; And died beneath them, frustrate. Harald sent A herald to that city proffering terms: “Harald is dead: Christian was he in youth: He sends you spoils from many a city burnt And craves interment in your chiefest church.” Next day the masked procession wound in black Through streets defenceless. When the church was reached They laid their chief before the altar-lights: Anon to heaven rang out the priestly dirge, And incense-smoke upcurled. Forth from its cloud Sudden upleaped the dead man, club in hand, Spurning his coffin's gilded walls, and smote The hoary pontiff down, and brake his neck; And all those maskers doffed their weeds of woe And showed the mail beneath, and raised their swords And drowned that pavement in a sea of blood, While raging rushed their mates through portals wide, And, since that city seemed but scant of spoil Fired it and sailed. Ofttimes old Harald laughed That tale recounting.’ Many a Kentish chief Re-echoed Harald's laugh;—not Ethelbert: The war-scar reddening on his brow he rose And spake: ‘My Thanes, ye laugh at deeds accurst! An old King I, and make my prophecy One day that northern race which smites and laughs, Our kith and kin albeit, shall smite our coasts: That day ye will not laugh!’ Earconwald Not rising, likewise answer made, heart-grieved: ‘Six sons had I: all these are slain in war; Yet I, an unrejoicing man forlorn, Find solace ofttimes thinking of their deeds: They laughed not when they smote. No God, be sure, Smiles on the jest red-handed.’ Egfrid rose, And three times cried with lifted sword unsheathed, ‘Behold my God! No God save him I serve!’ While thus they held discourse, where blue waves danced Not far from land, behold, there hove in sight Seen 'twixt a great beech silky yet with Spring And pine broad-crested, round whose head old storms Had wov'n a garland of his own green boughs, A bark both fair and large; and hymn was heard. Then laughed the King, ‘The stag-hunt and our songs So drugged my memory, I had nigh forgotten Why for our feast I chose this heaven-roofed hall: Missives I late received from friends in France; They make report of strangers from the South Who, tarrying in their coasts have learned our tongue And northward wend with tidings strange and new Of some celestial Kingdom by their God Founded for men of Faith. Nor churl am I To frown on kind intent, nor child to trust This sceptre of Seven Realms to magic snare That puissance hath—who knows not?—greater thrice In house than open field. I therefore chose For audience hall this precinct.’ Muttered low Murdark, the scoffer with the cave-like mouth And sidelong eyes, ‘Queen Bertha's voice was that! A woman's man! Since first from Gallic shores That dainty daughter of King Charibert Pressed her small foot on England's honest shore The whole land dwindles!’ Mid seraphic hymns Ere long that serpent hiss was lost: for soon In raiment white, circling a rocky point O'er sands still glistening with a tide far-ebbed, On drew, preceded by a silver Cross, A long Procession. Music as it moved Floated on sea-winds inland, deadened now By thickets, echoed now from cliff or cave: Ere long before them that Procession stood. The King addressed them: ‘Welcome, Heralds sage! If sent from God I welcome you the more, Since great is God, and therefore great His gifts: God grant He send them daily, heaped and huge! Speak without fear, for him alone I hate Who brings ill news, or makes inept demand Unmeet for Kings. I know the Cross ye bear; And in my palace sits a Christian wife, Bertha, the sweetest lady in this land; Most gracious in her ways, in heart most leal. I knew her yet a child: she knelt whene'er The Queen, her mother, entered: then I said, A maid so reverent will be reverent wife, And wedded her betimes. Morning and eve She in her wood-girt chapel sings her prayer, Which wins us kindlier harvest, and, some think, Success in war. She strives not with our Gods: Confusion never wrought she in my house, Nor minished Hengist's glory. Had her voice, Clangorous or strident, drawn upon my throne Deserved opprobrium’—here the monarch's brows Flushed at the thought, and fire was in his eyes— ‘The hand that clasps this sceptre had not spared To hunt her forth an outcast in the woods, Thenceforth with beasts to herd! More lief were I To take the lioness to my bed and board Than house a rebel wife.’ Remembering then The mildness of his Queen, King Ethelbert Resumed, appeased, for placable his heart; ‘But she no rebel is, and this I deem Fair auspice for her Faith.’ A little breeze Warm from the sea that moment softly waved The standard from its staff, and showed thereon The Child Divine. Upon His mother's knee Sublime He stood. His left hand clasped a globe Crowned with a golden Cross; and with His right Two fingers heavenward raised, o'er all the earth He sent His blessing. Of that band snow-stoled One taller by the head than all the rest Obeisance made; then, pointing to the Cross, And forward moving t'ward the monarch's seat, Opened the great commission of the Faith: ‘Behold the Eternal Maker of the worlds! That hand which shaped the earth and blesses earth Must rule the race of man!’ Majestic then As when, far winding from its mountain springs, City and palm-grove far behind it left, Some Indian river rolls while mists dissolved Leave it in native brightness unobscured, And kingly navies share its sea-ward sweep, Forward on-flowed in Apostolic might Augustine's strong discourse. With God beginning He showed the Almighty all-compassionate Down drawn from distance infinite to man By the Infinite of Love. Lo, Bethlehem's crib! There lay the Illimitable in narrow bound: Thence rose that triumph of a world redeemed! Last, to the standard pointing, thus he spake: ‘Yon standard tells the tale! Six hundred years Westward it speeds from subject realm to realm; First from the bosom of God's Race Elect, His people, till they slew Him, mild it soared: Rejected, it returned. Above their walls While ruin rocked them, and the Roman fire, Dreadful it hung. When Rome had shared that guilt Mocking that Saviour's Brethren and His Bride, Above the conquered conqueror of all lands In turn this Standard flew. Who raised it high? A son of this your island, Constantine! In these, thine English oakwoods, Helena, 'Twas thine to nurse thy warrior. He had seen Star-writ in heaven the words this Standard bears, “Through Me is victory.” Victory won, he raised High as his empire's queenly head, and higher, This Standard of the Eternal Dove thenceforth To fly where eagle standard never flew, God's glory in its track, goodwill to man. Advance for aye, great Emblem! Light as now Famed Asian headlands, and Hellenic isles! O'er snow-crowned Alp and citied Apennine Send forth a breeze of healing! Keep thy throne For ever on those western peaks that watch The setting sun descend the Hesperean wave, Atlas and Calpe! These, the old Roman bound, Build but the gateway of the Rome to be— Till Christ returns thou Standard, hold them fast: But never till the North, that, age by age, Dashed back the Pagan Rome, with Christian Rome Partakes the spiritual crown of man restored From thy strong flight above the world surcease, And fold thy wings in rest!’ Upon the sod He knelt, and on that standard gazed, and spake, Calm-voiced, with hand to heaven: ‘I promise thee, Thou Sign, another victory, and thy best— This island shall be thine!’ Augustine rose And took the right hand of King Ethelbert, And placed therein the Standard's staff, and laid His own above the monarch's, speaking thus: ‘King of this land, I bid thee know from God That kings have higher privilege than they know, The standard-bearers of the King of kings.’ Long time he clasped that royal hand; long time The King, that patriarch's hand at last withdrawn, His own withdrew not from that Standard's staff Committed to his charge. His hand he deemed Thenceforth its servant vowed. With large, meek eyes Fixed on that Maid and Babe, he stood as child That, gazing on some reverent stranger's face Nor loosening from that stranger's hold his palm, Listens his words attent. The Man of God Meantime as silent gazed on Thanet's shore Gold-tinged, with sunset spray to crimson turned In league-long crescent. Love was in his face, That love which rests on Faith. He spake: ‘Fair land, I know thee what thou art, and what thou lack'st! The Master saith, “I give to him that hath:” Thy harvest shall be great.’ Again he mused, And shadow o'er him crept. Again he spake: ‘That harvest won, when centuries have gone by, What countenance wilt thou wear? How oft on brows Brightened by Baptism's splendour, sin more late Drags down its cloud! The time may come when thou This day, though darkling, yet so innocent, Barbaric, not depraved, on greater heights May'st sin in malice—sin the great offence, Changing thy light to darkness, knowing God, Yet honouring God no more: that time may come When, rich as Carthage, great in arms as Rome, Keen-eyed as Greece, this isle, to sensuous gaze A sun all gold, to angels may present Aspect no nobler than a desert waste, Some blind and blinding waste of sun-scorched sands, Trod by a race of pigmies not of men, Pigmies by passions ruled!’ Once more he mused; Then o'er his countenance passed a second change; And from it flashed the light of one who sees, Some hill-top gained, beyond the incumbent night The instant foot of morn. With regal step, Martial yet measured, to the King he strode, And laid a strong hand on him, speaking thus: ‘Rejoice, my son, for God hath sent thy Land This day Good Tidings of exceeding joy, And planted in her Breast a Tree divine Whose leaves shall heal far nations. Know besides Should sickness blight that Tree, or tempest mar it, The strong root shall survive: the winter past, Heavenward once more shall rush both branch and bough, And over-vault the stars.’ He spake, and took The sacred Standard from that monarch's hand, And held it in his own, and fixed its point Deep in the earth, and by it stood. Then lo! Like one disburthened of some ponderous charge, King Ethelbert became himself again, And round him gazed well pleased. Throughout his train Sudden a movement thrilled: remembrance had Of those around, his warriors and his thanes, That ever on his wisdom waiting hung, Thus he replied discreet: ‘Stranger and friend, Thou bear'st good tidings! That thou camest thus far To fool us, knave and witling may believe: I walk not with their sort; yet, guest revered, Kings are not as the common race of men; Counsel they take, lest honour heaped on one Dishonour others. Odin holds on us Prescriptive right, and special claims on me, Of Hengist's race—thence Odin's. Preach your Faith! The man who wills I suffer to believe: The man who wills not, let him moor his skiff Where anchorage likes him best. The day declines: This night with us you harbour, and our Queen Shall lovingly receive you.’ Staid and slow The King rode homewards, while behind him paced Augustine and his Monks. The ebb had left 'Twixt Thanet and the mainland narrow space Marsh-land more late; beyond the ford there wound A path through flowery meads; and, as they passed, Not herdsmen only, but the broad-browed kine Fixed on them long their meditative gaze; And oft some blue-eyed boy with flaxen locks Ran, fearless, forth, and plucked them by the sleeve, Some boy clear-browed as those Saint Gregory marked, Poor slaves, new-landed from the quays of Rome, That drew from him that saying, ‘“Angli”!—nay, Call them henceforward “Angels”!’ From a wood Issuing, before them lustrous they beheld King Ethelbert's chief city Canterbury, Strong-walled, with winding street, and airy roofs, And high o'er all the monarch's palace pile Thick-set with towers. Then fire from God there fell Upon Augustine's heart: and thus he sang Advancing; and the brethren sang ‘Amen’: ‘Hail, City loved of God, for on thy brow Great Fates are writ. Thou cumberest not His earth For petty traffic reared, or petty sway; I see a heavenly choir descend, thy crown Henceforth to bind thy brow. Forever hail! ‘I see the basis of a kingly throne In thee ascending! High it soars and higher, Like some great pyramid o'er Nilus kenned When vapours melt—the Apostolic Chair! Doctrine and Discipline thence shall hold their course, Like Tigris and Euphrates, through all lands That face the Northern Star. Forever hail! ‘Where stands yon royal keep, a church shall rise Like Incorruption clothing the Corrupt On the resurrection morn! Strong House of God, To him exalt thy walls, and nothing doubt For lo! from thee like lions from their lair Abroad shall pace the Primates of this land: They shall not lick the hand that gives and smites Doglike, nor snakelike on their bellies creep In indirectness base. They shall not fear The people's madness nor the rage of kings Reddening the temple's pavement. They shall lift The strong brow mitred, and the crosiered hand Before their presence sending Love and Fear To pave their steps with greatness. From their fronts Stubborned with marble from Saint Peter's Rock The sunrise of far centuries forth shall flame: He that hath eyes shall see it, and shall say, “Blessed who cometh in the name of God!”’ Thus sang the Saint, advancing; and, behold, At every pause the brethren sang ‘Amen!’ While down from window and from roof the throng Eyed them in silence. As their anthem ceased Before them stood the palace clustered round By many a stalwart form. Midway the gate On the first step, like angel newly lit Queen Bertha stood. Back from her forehead meek The meeker for its crown, a veil descended, While streamed the red robe to the foot snow-white Sandalled in gold. The morn was on her face, The star of morn within those eyes upraised That flashed all dewy with the grateful light Of many a granted prayer. O'er that sweet shape Augustine signed the Venerable sign; The lovely vision sinking, hand to breast, Received it; while, by sympathy surprised Or taught of God, the monarch and his thanes Knelt as she knelt, and bent like her their heads, Sharing her blessing. Like a palm the Faith Thenceforth o'er England rose, those saintly men Preaching by life severe, not words alone, The doctrine of the Cross. Some Power divine Stronger than patriot love, more sweet than Spring, Made way from heart to heart, and daily God Joined to His Church the souls that should be saved, Thousands, where Medway mingles with the Thames, Rushing to Baptism. In his palace cell High-nested on that Vaticanian Hill Which o'er the Martyr-gardens kens the world Gregory, that news receiving, or from men Or haply from that God with whom he walked The Spirit's whisper ever in his ear, Rejoiced that hour, and cried aloud, ‘Rejoice, Thou Earth! that North which from its cloud but flung The wild beasts' cry of anger or of pain Redeemed from wrath, its Hallelujahs sings; Its waves by Roman galleys feared, this day Kiss the bare feet of Christ's Evangelists; That race whose oak-clubs brake our Roman swords Glories now first in bonds—the bond of Truth: At last it fears; but fears alone to sin, Striving through Faith for Virtue's heavenly crown.’ THE CONSECRATION OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY. Sebert, King of the East Saxons, having built the great church of Saint Peter at Westminster, Mellitus the Bishop prepares to consecrate it, but is warned in a vision that it has already been consecrated by one greater than he. As morning brake, Sebert, East Saxon king, Stood on the winding shores of Thames alone, And fixed a sparkling eye upon Saint Paul's: The sun new-risen had touched its roofs that laughed Their answer back. Beyond it London spread; But all between the river and that church Was slope of grass and blossoming orchard copse Glittering with dews dawn-reddened. Bertha here, That church begun had thus besought her Lord ‘Spare me this bank which God has made so fair! Here let the little birds have leave to sing The bud to blossom! Here, the vespers o'er, Lovers shall sit; and here, in later days, Children shall question, “Who was he—Saint Paul? What taught, what wrought he that his name should shine Thus like the stars in heaven?”’ As Sebert stood The sweetness of the morning more and more Made way into his heart. The pale blue smoke Rising from hearths by woodland branches fed, Dimmed not the crystal matin air; not yet From clammy couch had risen the mist sun-warmed: All things distinctly showed; the rushing tide The barge, the trees, the long bridge many-arched, And countless huddled gables, far away, Lessening, yet still descried. A voice benign Dispersed the Prince's trance: ‘I marked, my King, Your face in yonder church; you took, I saw, A blessing thence; and Nature's here you find: The same God sends them both.’ The man who spake Though silver-tressed, was countenanced like a child; Smooth-browed, clear-eyed. That still and luminous mien Predicted realms where Time shall be no more; Where gladness, like some honey-dew divine, Freshens an endless present. Mellitus, From Rome late missioned and the Cœlian Hill Made thus his greeting. Westward by the Thames The King and Bishop paced, and held discourse Of him whose name that huge Cathedral bore, Israel's great son, the man of mighty heart, The man for her redemption zealous more Than for his proper crown. Not task for her God gave him: to the Gentiles still he preached And won them to the Cross. ‘That Faith once spurned,’ Thus cried the Bishop with a kindling eye, ‘Lo, how it raised him as on eagle's wings And past the starry gates; The Spirit's Sword He wielded well! Save him who bears the Keys, Save him who made confession, “Thou art Christ,” Saint Paul had equal none! Hail, Brethren crowned! Hail, happy Rome, that guard'st their mingled dust!’ Next spake the Roman of those churches twain By Constantine beside the Tyber built To glorify their names. With sudden turn Sebert, the crimson mounting to his brow, Made question, ‘Is your Tyber of the South Ampler than this, our Thames?’ The old man smiled; ‘Tyber to Thames is as that willow-stock To yonder oak.’ The Saxon cried with joy: ‘How true thy judgment is! how just thy tongue! What hinders, O my Father, but that Thames, Huge river from the forests rolled by God, Should image, like that Tyber, churches twain, Honouring those Princes of the Apostles' Band? King Ethelbert, my uncle, built Saint Paul's; Saint Peter's Church be mine!’ An hour's advance Left them in thickets tangled. Low the ground, Well-nigh by waters clipt, a savage haunt With briar and bramble thick, and ‘Thorny Isle’ For that cause named. Sebert around him gazed, A maiden blush upon him thus he spake: ‘I know this spot; I stood here once, a boy: 'Twas winter then: the swoll'n and turbid flood Rustled the sallows. Far I fled from men: A youth had done me wrong, and vengeful thoughts Burned in my heart: I warred with them in vain: I prayed against them; yet they still returned: O'erspent at last, I cast me on my knees And cried, “Just God, if Thou despise my prayer, Faithless, thence weak, not less remember well How many a man in this East Saxon land Stands up this hour, in wood, or field, or farm, Like me sore tempted, but with loftier heart: To these be helpful—yea, to one of these!” And lo, the wrathful thoughts, like routed fiends, Left me, and came no more!’ Discoursing thus, The friends a moment halted in a space Where stood a flowering thorn. Adown it trailed In zigzag curves erratic here and there Long lines of milky bloom, like rills of foam Furrowing the green back of some huge sea wave Refluent from cliffs. Ecstatic minstrelsy Swelled from its branches. Birds as thick as leaves Thronged them; and whether joy was theirs that hour Because the May had come, or joy of love, Or tenderer gladness for their young new-fledged, So piercing was that harmony, the place Eden to Sebert looked, while brake and bower Shone like the Tree of Life. ‘What minster choir,’ The Bishop cried, ‘could better chant God's praise? Here shall your church ascend:—its altar rise Where yonder thorn tree stands!’ The old man spake; Yet in him lived a thought unbreathed: ‘How oft Have trophies risen to blazon deeds accursed! Angels this church o'er-winging, age on age Shall see that boy at prayer!’ In peace, in war, Daily the work advanced. The youthful King Kneeling, himself had raised the earliest sod, Made firm the corner stone. Whate'er of gold Sun-ripened harvests of the royal lands Yielded from Thames to Stour, or tax and toll From quays mast-thronged to loud-resounding sea, Save what his realm required by famine vexed At times, or ravage of the Mercian sword, Went to the work. His Queen her jewels brought, Smiling, huge gift in slenderest hands up-piled; His thanes their store; the poor their labour free. Some clave the quarry's ledges: from its depths Some haled the blocks; from distant forests some Dragged home the oak-beam on the creaking wain: Alas, that arms in noble tasks so strong Should e'er have sunk in dust! Ere ten years passed Saint Peter's towers above the high-roofed streets Smiled on Saint Paul's. That earlier church had risen Where stood, in Roman days, Apollo's fane: Upon a site to Dian dedicate Now rose its sister. Erring Faith had reached In those twin Powers that ruled the Day and Night, To Wisdom witnessing and Chastity, Her loftiest height, and perished. Phœnix-like, From ashes of dead rites and Truth abused Now soared unstained Religion. What remained? The Consecration. On its eve, the King Held revel in its honour, solemn feast, And wisely-woven dance, where beauty and youth, Through loveliest measures moving, music-winged, And winged not less by gladness, interwreathed Brightness with brightness, glance turned back on glance, And smile on smile—a courtseying graciousness Of stateliest forms that, winding, sank or rose As if on heaving seas. In groups apart Old warriors clustered. Eadbald discussed And Snorr, that truce with Wessex signed, and said, ‘Fear nought: it cannot last!’ A shadow sat That joyous night upon one brow alone, Redwald's East Anglia's King. In generous youth He, guest that time with royal Ethelbert, Had gladly bowed to Christ. From shallowest soil Faith springs apace, but springs to die. Returned To plains of Ely, all that sweetness past Seemed but a dream while scornful spake his wife, Upon whose brow beauty from love divorced Made beauty's self unbeauteous: ‘Lose—why not?— Thwarting your liegeful subjects, lose at will Your Kingdom; you that might have reigned ere now Bretwalda of the Seven!’ In hour accursed The weak man with his Faith equivocated: Fraudful, beneath the self-same roofs he raised Altars to Christ and idols. By degrees That Truth he mocked forsook him. Year by year His face grew dark, and barbed his tongue though smooth, Manner and mind like grass-fields after thaw, Silk-soft above, yet iron-hard below: Spleenful that night at Sebert's blithe discourse He answered thus, with seeming-careless eye Wandering from wall to roof: ‘I like your Church: Would it had rested upon firmer ground, Adorned some airier height: its towers are good, Though dark the stone: three quarries white have I; You might have used them gratis had you willed: At Ely, Elmham, and beside the Cam In the reign of Sigebert, Felix, Bishop of East Anglia, founded schools respecting which Montalembert remarks: ‘Plusieurs ont fait remonter à ces écoles monastiques l'origine de la célèbre université de Cambridge.’ Where Felix rears even now his cloistral Schools, I trust to build three churches soon: my Queen, That seconds still my wishes, says, “Beware Lest overhaste, your people still averse, Frustrate your high intent.” A woman's wit— Yet here my wife is wiser than her wont. I miss your Bishop: grandly countenanced he, Save for that mole. He shuns our revel:—ay! Monastic virtue never feels secure Save when it skulks in corners!’ As he spake, Despite that varnish on his brow clear-cut, Stung by remembrance, from the tutored eye Forth flashed the fire barbaric: race and heart A moment stood confessed. Old Mellitus, That night how fared he? In a fragile tent Facing that church expectant, low he knelt On the damp ground. More late, like youthful knight In chapel small watching his arms untried, He kept his consecration vigil still, With hoary hands screening a hoary head, And thus made prayer: ‘Thou God to Whom all worlds Form one vast temple: Thou Who with Thyself, Ritual eterne, dost consecrate that Church, For aye creating, hallowing it forever; Thou Who in narrowest heart of man or child Makest not less Thy dwelling, turn Thine eyes To-morrow on our rite. The work we work Work it Thyself! Thy storm shall try it well; Consummate first its strength in righteousness; So shall beginning just, whate'er befall, Or guard it, or restore.’ So prayed the man, Nor ever raised his head—saw nought—heard nought— Nor knew that on the night had come a change, Ill Spirits, belike, whose empire is the air, Grudging its glories to that pile new raised, And, while they might, assailing. Through the clouds A panic-stricken moon stumbled and fled, And wildly on the waters blast on blast Ridged their dark floor. A spring-tide from the sea Breasted the flood descending. Woods of Shene And Hampton's groves had heard that flood all day, No more a whisperer soft; and meadow banks Not yet o'er-gazed by Windsor's crested steep Or Reading's tower, had yielded to its wave Blossom and bud. More high, near Oxenford, Isis and Cherwell with precipitate stream Had swelled the current. Gathering thus its strength Far off and near, allies and tributaries That night by London onward rolled the Thames Beauteous and threatening both. Its southern bank Fronting the church had borne a hamlet long Where fishers dwelt. Upon its verge that night Perplexed the eldest stood: his hand was laid Upon the gunwale of a stranded boat; His knee was crooked against it. Shrinking still And sad, his eye pursued that racing flood, Here black like night, dazzled with eddies there, Eddies by moonshine glazed. In doubt he mused: Sudden a Stranger by him stood and spake: ‘Launch forth, and have no fear.’ The fisher gazed Once on his face; and launched. Beside the helm That Stranger sat. Then lo! a watery lane Before them opening, through the billows curved, Level, like meadow-path. As when a weed Drifts with the tide, so softly o'er that lane Oarless the boat advanced, and instant reached The northern shore, dark with that minster's shade;— Before them close it frowned. ‘Where now thou stand'st Abide thou:’ thus the Stranger spake; anon Before the church's southern gate he stood:— Then lo! a marvel. Inward as he passed, Its threshold crossed, a splendour as of God Forth from the bosom of that dusky pile Through all its kindling windows streamed, and blazed From wave to wave, and spanned that downward tide With many a fiery bridge. The moon was quenched; But all the edges of the headlong clouds Caught up the splendour till the midnight vault Shone like the noon. The fisher knew, that hour, That with vast concourse of the Sons of God That church was thronged; for in it many a head Sun-bright, and hands lifted like hands in prayer, High up he saw: meantime harmonic strain, As though whatever moves in earth or skies, Winds, waters, stars, had joined in one their song, Above him floated like a breeze from God And heaven-born incense. Louder swelled that strain; And still the Bride of God, that church late dark, Glad of her saintly spousals, laughed and shone In radiance ever freshening. By degrees That vision waned. At last the fisher turned: The matin star shook on the umbered wave; Along the East there lay a pallid streak, That streak which preludes dawn. Beside the man Once more that Stranger stood:—‘Seest thou yon tent? My Brother kneels within it. Thither speed And bid him know I sent thee, speaking thus, “He whom the Christians name ‘the Rock’ am I: My Master heard thy prayer: I sought thy church, And sang myself her Consecration rite: Close thou that service with thanksgiving psalm.”’ Thus spake the Stranger, and was seen no more: But whether o'er the waters, as of old Footing that Galilean Sea, with faith Not now infirm he reached the southern shore, Or passed from sight as one whom crowds conceal The fisher knew not. At the tent arrived, Before its little door he bent, and lo! Within, there knelt a venerable man With hoary hands screening a hoary head, Who prayed, and prayed. His tale the fisher told: With countenance unamazed, yet well content That kneeler answered, ‘Son, thy speech is true! Hence, and announce thy tidings to the King, Who leaves his couch but now.’ ‘How beautiful’— That old man sang, as down the Thames at morn In multitudinous pomp the barges dropped, Following those twain that side by side advanced, One royal, one pontific, bearing each The Cross in silver blazoned or in gold— ‘How beautiful, O Sion, are thy courts! The following hymns are from the Office for the Consecration of a Church. Lo, on thy brow thy Maker's name is writ: Fair is this place and awful; porch of heaven: Behold, God's Church is founded on a rock: It stands, and shall not fall: the gates of Hell Shall not prevail against it.’ From the barge Of Sebert and his Queen, antiphonal Rapturous response was wafted: ‘I beheld Jerusalem, the City sage and blest; From heaven I saw it to the earth descending In sanctity gold-vested, as a Bride Decked for her Lord. I heard a voice which sang, Behold the House where God will dwell with men: And God shall wipe the tears from off their face; And death shall be no more.’ Old Thames that day Brightened with banners of a thousand boats Winnowed by winds flower-scented. Countless hands Tossed on the brimming river chaplets wov'n On mead or hill, or branches lopped in woods With fruit-bloom red, or white with clustering cone, Changing clear stream to garden. Mile on mile Now song was heard, now bugle horn that died Gradual 'mid sedge and reed. Alone the swan High on the western waters kept aloof; Remote she eyed the scene with neck thrown back, Her ancient calm preferring, and her haunt Crystalline still. Alone the Julian Tower Far down the eastern stream, though tap'stries waved From every window, every roof o'er-swarmed With anthem-echoing throngs, maintained, unmoved, Roman and Stoic, her Cæsarean pride: On Saxon feasts she fixed a cold, grey gaze; 'Mid Christian hymns heard but the old acclaim— ‘Consul Romanus.’ When the sun had reached Its noonday height, a people and its king Around their minster pressed. With measured tread And Introit chanted, up the pillared nave Reverent they moved: then knelt. Between their ranks Their Bishop last advanced with mitred brow And in his hand the Cross, at every step Signing the benediction of his Lord. The altar steps he mounted. Turning then Westward his face to that innumerous host, Thus spake he unastonished: ‘Sirs, ere now This Church's Consecration rite was sung:— Be ours to sing thanksgiving to our God, “Ter-Sanctus,” and “Te Deum.”’ THE PENANCE OF SAINT LAURENCE. Eadbald, King of Kent, persecuting the Church, Laurence the Bishop deems himself the chief of sinners because he has consented, like the neighbouring bishops, to depart; but, being consoled by a wonderful reprimand, faces the King, and offers himself up to death. The King reproves them that gave him evil counsel. The day was dying on the Kentish downs And in the oakwoods by the Stour was dead, While sadly shone o'er snowy plains of March Her comfortless, cold star. The daffodil That year was past its time. The leaden stream Had waited long that lamp of river-beds Which, when the lights of Candlemas are quenched, Looks forth through February mists. A film Of ice lay brittle on the shallows: dark And swift the central current rushed: the wind Sighed through the tawny sedge. ‘So fleets our life— Like yonder gloomy stream; so sighs our age— Like yonder sapless sedge!’ Thus Laurence mused Standing on that sad margin all alone, His twenty years of gladsome English toil Ending at last abortive. ‘Stream well-loved, Here on thy margin standing saw I first, My head by chance uplifting from my book, King Ethelbert's strong countenance; he is dead; And, next him, riding through the April gleams, Bertha, his Queen, with face so lit by love Its lustre smote the beggar as she passed And changed his sigh to song. She too is dead; And half their thanes that chased the stag that day, Like echoes of their own glad bugle-horn, Have passed and are not. Why must I abide? And why must age, querulous and coward both, Past days lamenting, fear not less that stroke Which makes an end of grief? Base life of man! How sinks thy slow infection through our bones; Then when you fawned upon us, high-souled youth Heroic in its gladness, spurned your gifts, Yearning for noble death. In age, in age We kiss the hand that nothing holds but dust, Murmuring, “Not yet!”’ A tear, ere long ice-glazed, Hung on the old man's cheek. ‘What now remains?’ Some minutes passed; then, lifting high his head, He answered, ‘God remains.’ His faith, his heart, Were unsubverted. 'Twas the weight of grief, The exhausted nerve, the warmthless blood of age, That pressed him down like sin, where sin was none— Not sin, but weakness only. Long he mused, Then slowly walked, and feebly, through the woods Towards his house monastic. Vast it loomed Through ground-fog seen; and vaster, close beside, That convent's church by great Augustine reared Where once old woodlands clasped a temple old, Vaunt of false Gods. To Peter and to Paul That church was dedicate, albeit so long High o'er the cloudy rack of fleeting years It bore, and bears, its founder's name, not theirs. Therein that holy founder slept in Christ, And Ethelbert, and Bertha. All was changed: King Eadbald, new-crowned and bad of life Who still, whate'er was named of great or good, Made answer, ‘Dreams! I say the flesh rules all!’ Hated the Cross. His Queen, that portent crowned, She that with name of wife was yet no wife, Abhorred that Cross and feared. A Baptist new In that Herodian court had Laurence stood, Commanding, ‘Put the evil thing away!’ Since then the woman's to the monarch's hate Had added strength—the serpent's poison-bag Venoming the serpent's fang. ‘Depart the realm!’ With voice scarce human thus the tyrant cried, ‘Depart or die!’ and gave the Church's goods To clown and boor. Upon the bank of Thames Settled like ruin. Holy Sebert dead, In that East Saxon kingdom monarch long, Three sons unrighteous now their riot held. Frowning upon the Christian Church they strode, Full-armed, and each, with far-stretched foot firm set Watching the Christian rite. ‘Give us,’ they cried, While knelt God's children at their Paschal Feast, ‘Give us those circlets of your sacred bread: Ye feed therewith your beggars; kings are we!’ The Bishop answered, ‘Be, like them, baptized, Sons of God's Church, His Sacrament with man, For that cause Mother of Christ's Sacraments, So shall ye share her Feast.’ With lightning speed Their swords leaped forth; contemptuous next they cried, ‘For once we spare to sweep a witless head From worthless shoulders. Ere to-morrow's dawn Hence, nor return!’ He sped to Rochester: Her bishop, like himself, was under ban: The twain to Canterbury passed, and there Resolved to let the tempest waste its wrath, And crossed the seas. By urgency outworn, 'Gainst that high judgment of his holier will Laurence to theirs deferred, but tarried yet For one day more to cast a last regard On regions loved so long. As compline ceased He reached the abbey gates, and entered in: Sadly the brethren looked him in the face, Yet no one said, ‘Take comfort!’ Sad and sole He passed to the Scriptorium: round he gazed, And thought of happy days, when Gregory, One time their Abbot, next their Pope, would send Some precious volume to his exiled sons, While they in reverence knelt, and kissed its edge, And, kissing, heard once more, as if in dream, Gregorian chants through Roman palm trees borne With echoes from the Coliseum's wall Adown that Cœlian Hill; and saw God's poor At feast around that humble board which graced That palace senatorial once. He stood: He raised a casket from an open chest, And from that casket drew a blazoned scroll, And placed it on the window-sill up-sloped Breast-high, and faintly warmed by sinking sun; Then o'er it bent a space. With sudden hands The old man raised that scroll; aloud he read: ‘I, Ethelbert the King, and all my Thanes, Honouring the Apostle Peter, cede to God This Abbey and its lands. If heir of mine Cancel that gift, when Christ with angels girt Makes way to judge the Nations of this world, His name be cancelled from the Book of Life.’ The old man paused; then read the signatures, ‘I, Ethelbert, of Kent the King.’ Who next? ‘I, Eadbald, his son;’ to these succeeding, ‘I, Hennigisil, Duke;’ ‘I, Hocca, Earl.’— ‘Can such things be?’ Around the old man's brow The veins swelled out; dilated nostril, mouth Working as mouth of him that tasteth death, With what beside is wiselier unrevealed, Witnessed that agony which spake no more; He dashed the charter on the pavement down; Then on it gazed a space. Remembering soon Whose name stood first on that dishonoured list, Contrite he raised that charter to his breast, And pressed it there in silence. Hours went by; Then dark was all that room, and dark around The windy corridors and courts stone-paved; And bitter blew the blast: his unlooped cloak Fell loose: the cold he noted not. At last A brother passed the door with lamp in hand: Dazzled, he started first: then meekly spake, ‘Beseech the brethren that they strew my bed Within the church. Until the second watch There must I fast, and pray.’ The brethren heard, And strewed his couch within the vast, void nave, A mat and deer-skin, and, more high, that stone The old head's nightly pillow. Echoes faint Ere long of their receding footsteps died While from the dark fringe of a rainy cloud An ice-cold moon, ascending, streaked the church With gleam and gloom alternate. On his knees Meantime that aged priest was creeping slow From stone to stone, as when on battle-plain, The battle lost, some warrior wounded sore By all forsaken, or some war-horse maimed Drags a blind bulk along the fields in search Of thirst-assuaging spring. Glittered serene That light before the Sacrament of Love: Thither he bent his way, and long time prayed: Thence onward crept to where King Ethelbert Slept, marble-shrined—his ashes, not the King, Yet ashes kingly since God's temple once, And waiting God's great day. Before that tomb, Himself as rigid, with lean arms outspread, Thus made the man his moan: ‘King Ethelbert! Hear'st thou in glory? Ofttimes on thy knees Thou mad'st confession of thine earthly sins To me, a wounded worm this day on earth: Now comforted art thou, and I brought low: Yet, though I see no more that beaming front And haply for my sins may see it never Yet inwardly I gladden, knowing this That thou art glad. Perchance thou hear'st me not For thou wert still a heedless man of mirth, Though sage as strong at need. If this were so, Not less thy God would hear my prayer to thee And grant it in thy reverence. Ethelbert! Thou had'st thy trial time, since, many a year All shepherdless thy well-loved people strayed What time thyself, their shepherd, knew'st not Christ, Sole shepherd of man's race. King Ethelbert! Rememberest thou that day in Thanet Isle? That day the Bride of God on English shores Set her pure foot; and thou didst kneel to kiss it: Thou gav'st her meat and drink in kingly wise; Gav'st her thy palace for her bridal bower; This Abbey build'dst—her fortress! O those days Crowned with such glories, with such sweetness winged! Thou saw'st thy realm made one with Christ's: thou saw'st Thy race like angels ranging courts of Heaven: This day, behold, thou seest the things thou seest! If there be any hope, King Ethelbert Help us this day with God!’ Upon his knees Then crept that exile old to Bertha's tomb, And there made moan: ‘Thou tenderest Queen and sweetest, Whom no man ever gazed on save with joy Or spake of, dead, save weeping! Well I know That on thee in thy cradle Mary flung A lily whiter from her hand, a rose Warm from her breath and breast, for all thy life Was made of Chastities and Charities: This hour thine eyes are on that Vision bent Whereof the radiance, ere by thee beheld, Gave thee thine earthly brightness. Mirrored there, Seest thou, like moat in sunbeam well-nigh lost, Our world of temporal anguish? See it not! For He alone, the essential Peace Eterne Could see it unperturbed. In Him rejoice! Yet, 'mid thy heavenly triumph, plead, O plead For hearts that break below!’ Upon the ground A while that man sore tried his forehead bowed; Then raised it till the frore and foggy beam Mixed with his wintry hair. Once more he crept Upon his knees through shadow; reached at length His toilsome travel's last and dearest bourn, The grave of Saint Augustine. O'er it lay The Patriarch's statued semblance as in sleep: He knew it well, and found it, though to him In darkness lost and veil beside of tears, With level hands grazing those upward feet Oft kissed, yet ne'er as now. ‘Farewell forever! Farewell, my Master, and farewell, my friend! Since ever thou in heaven abid'st—and I— Gregory the Pontiff from that Roman Hill Sent thee to work a man's work far away, And manlike didst thou work it. Prince, yet child, Men saw thee, and obeyed thee. O'er the earth Thy step was regal, meekness of thy Christ Weighted with weight of conquerors and of kings: Men saw a man who toiled not for himself Yet never ceased from toil; who warred on Sin; Had peace with all beside. In happy hour God laid his holy hand upon thine eyes: I knelt beside thy bed: I leaned mine ear Down to thy lips to catch their last; in vain: Yet thou perchance wert murmuring in thy heart “I leave my staff within no hireling's hand; Therefore my work shall last.” Ah me! Ah me! There was a Laurence once on Afric's shore: He with his Cyprian died. I too, methinks, Had shared—how gladly shared—my Bishop's doom. Father, with Gregory pray this night! That God Who promised, “for my servant David's sake,” Even yet may hear thy prayer.’ Thus wept the man, Till o'er him fell half slumber. Soon he woke And, from between that statue's marble feet Lifting a marble face, in silence crept To where far off his bed was strewn, and drew The deer-skin covering o'er him. With its warmth Deep sleep, that solace of lamenting hearts Which makes the waking bitterer, o'er him sank, Nor wholly left him, though in sleep he moaned When from the neighbouring farm, an hour ere dawn, The second time rang out that clarion voice Which bids the Christian watch. As thus he lay T'wards him there moved in visions of the Lord A Venerable Shape, compact of light, And loftier than our mortal. Near arrived, That mild, compassionate Splendour shrank his beam, Or healed with strengthening touch the gazer's eyes Made worthier of such grace; and Laurence saw Princedom not less than his, the Apostles' Chief, To whom the Saviour answered, ‘Rock art thou,’ And later—crowning Love, not less than Faith— ‘Feed thou My Sheep, My Lambs!’ He knew that shape For oft, a child 'mid catacombs of Rome And winding ways girt by the martyred dead His eyes had seen it. Pictured on those vaults Stood Peter, Moses of the Christian Law, Figured in one that by the Burning Bush Unsandalled knelt, or drew with lifted hand The torrent from the rock, yet wore not less In aureole round his head the Apostle's name ‘Petros,’ and in his hand sustained the Keys: Such shape once more he saw. ‘And comest thou then Long-waited, or with sceptre-wielding hand Earthward to smite the unworthiest head on earth, Or with the darker of those Keys thou bearest Him from the synod of the Saints to shut Who fled as flies the hireling? Let it be! Not less in that bright City by whose gate Warder thou sitt'st, my Master thou shalt see Pacing the diamond terraces of God And bastions jacinth-veined, my great Augustine, When all who wrought the ill have passed to doom, And all who missed the good. Nor walks he sole: By him forever and forever pace My Ethelbert, my Bertha! Who can tell But in the on-sweeping centuries thrice or twice These three may name my name?’ He spake and wept. To whom the Apostolic Splendour thus: ‘Live, and be strong: for those thou lovest in Christ Not only in far years shall name thy name; This day be sure that name they name in Christ: Else wherefore am I here? Not thou alone Much more in grief's bewilderment than fear Hast from the right way swerved. Was I not strong? I, from the first Elect and named anew? I who received at first divine command The Brother-band to strengthen; last to rule? I who to Hebrew and to Gentile both Flung wide the portals of the heavenly realm? Was I not strong? Behold, thou know'st my fall! A second fall was near. At Rome the sword Against me raged. Forth by the Appian Way I fled; and, past the gateway, face to face, Him met Who up the steep of Calvary bare For man's behoof the Cross. “Where goest Thou, Lord?” I spake; then He: “I go to Rome, once more To die for him who fears for Me to die.” To Rome returned I; and my end was peace. Return thou too. Thy brethren have not sinned: They fled, consentient with the Will Supreme: Their names are written in the Book of Life: Enough that He Who gives to each his part Hath sealed thy sons and thee to loftier fates Therefore more sternly tries. Be strong; be glad: For strength from joyance comes.' The Vision passed: The old man, seated on his narrow bed, Rolled thrice his eyes around the vast, dim church, Desiring to retain it. Vain the quest! Yet still within his heart that Radiance lived: The sweetness of that countenance fresh from God Would not be dispossessed, but kindled there Memorial dawn of brightness, more and more Growing to perfect day: inviolate peace, Such peace as heavenly visitants bequeath, O'er-spread his spirit, gradual, like a sea: Forth from the bosom of that peace upsoared Hope, starry-crowned, and winged, that liberates oft Faith, unextinct, though bound by Powers accursed That o'er her plant the foot, and hold the chain— Terror and Sloth. To noble spirits set free Delight means gratitude. Thus Laurence joyed: But soon, remembering that unworthy past, Remorse succeeded, sorrow born of love, Consoled by love alone. ‘Ah! slave,’ he cried, ‘That, serving such a God, could'st dream of flight: How many a babe too weak to lift his head Is strong enough to die!’ While thus he mused The day-dawn reaching to his pallet showed That Discipline, wire-woven, in ancient days Guest of monastic bed. He snatched it thence: Around his bending neck and shoulders lean In dire revenge he hurled it. Spent at last, Though late, those bleeding hands down dropped: the cheek Sank on the stony pillow. Little birds, Low-chirping ere their songs began, attuned Slumber unbroken. In a single hour He slept a long night's sleep. The rising sun Woke him: but in his heart another sun, New-risen serene with healing on its wings, Outshone that sun in brightness. 'Mid the choir His voice was loudest while they chanted lauds: Brother to brother whispered, issuing forth, ‘He walks in stature higher by a head Than in the month gone by!’ That day at noon King Eadwald, intent to whiten theft And sacrilege with sanctitudes of law, Girt by his warriors and his Witena, Enthronèd sat. ‘What boots it?’ laughed a thane; ‘Laurence has fled! we battle with dead men!’ ‘Ay, ay,’ the King replied, ‘I told you oft Sages can brag; your dreamer weaves his dream: But honest flesh rules all!’ While thus they spake Confusion filled the hall: through guarded gates A priest advanced with mitre and with Cross, A monk that seemed not monk, but prince disguised: It was Saint Laurence. As he neared the throne The fashion of the tyrant's face was changed: ‘Dar'st thou?’ he cried, ‘I deemed thee fled the realm— What seek'st thou here?’ The Saint made answer, ‘Death.’ Calmly he told his tale; then ended thus: ‘To me that sinful past is sin of one Buried in years gone by. All else is dream Save that last look the Apostle on me bent Ere from my sight he ceased. I saw therein The reflex of that wondrous last Regard Cast by the sentenced Saviour of mankind On one who had denied Him, standing cold Beside the High Priest's gate. Like him, I wept; His countenance wrought my penance, not his hand: I scarcely felt the scourge.’ King Eadbald Drave back the sword half drawn, and round him stared; Then sat as one amazed. He rose; he cried, ‘Ulf! Kathnar! Strip his shoulders bare? If true His tale, the brand remains!’ Two chiefs stepped forth: They dragged with trembling hand, and many a pause, The external garb pontific first removed, Dark, blood-stained garment from the bleeding flesh, The old man kneeling. Once, and only once, The monarch gazed on that disastrous sight, Muttering, ‘and yet he lives!’ A time it was Of swift transitions. Hearts, how proud soe'er, Made not that boast—consistency in sin, Though dark and rough accessible to Grace As earth to vernal showers. With hands hardclenched The King upstarted: thus his voice rang out: ‘Beware, who gave ill counsel to their King! The royal countenance is against them set, Ill merchants trafficking with his lesser moods! Does any say the King wrought well of late, Warring on Christ, and chasing hence His priests? The man that lies shall die! This day, once more I ratify my Father's oath, and mine, To keep the Church in peace: and though I sware To push God's monks from yonder monastery And lodge therein the horses of the Queen, Those horses, and the ill-persuading Queen, Shall flee my kingdom, and the monks abide! Brave work ye worked, my loose-kneed Witena, This day, Christ's portion yielding to my wrath! See how I prize your labours!’ With his sword He clave the red seal from the statute scroll And stamped it under foot. Once more he spake, Gazing with lion gaze from man to man: ‘The man that, since my Father, Ethelbert, Though monarch, stooped to common doom of men, Hath filched from Holy Church fee-farm, or grange, Sepulchral brass, gold chalice, bell or book, See he restore it ere the sun goes down; If not, he dies! Not always winter reigns; May-breeze returns, and bud-releasing breath, When hoped the least:—'tis thus with royal minds!’ He spake: from that day forth in Canterbury Till reigned the Norman, crowned on Hastings' field, God's Church had rest. In many a Saxon realm Convulsion rocked her cradle: altars raised By earlier kings by later were o'erthrown: One half the mighty Roman work, and more, Fell to the ground: Columba's Irish monks The ruin raised. From Canterbury's towers, ‘Rome of the North’ long named, from them alone Above sea-surge still shone that vestal fire By tempest fanned, not quenched; and at her breast For centuries six were nursed that Cœlian race, The Benedictine Primates of the Land. KING SIGEBERT OF EAST ANGLIA, AND HEIDA THE PROPHETESS. Sigebert, King of East Anglia, moved by what he has heard from a Christian priest, consults the Prophetess Heida. In the doctrine he reports Heida recognises certain sacred traditions from the East, originally included in the Northern religion, and affirms that the new Faith is the fulfilment of the great Voluspá prophecy, the earliest record of that religion, which foretold the destruction both of the Odin-Gods and the Giant race, the restoration of all things, and the reign of Love. Long time upon the late-closed door the King Kept his eyes fixed. The wondrous guest was gone; Yet, seeing that his words were great and sage Compassionate for the sorrowful state of man Yet sparing not man's sin, their echoes lived Thrilling large chambers in the monarch's breast Silent for many a year. Exiled in France The mystery of the Faith had reached his ear In word but not in power. The westering sun Lengthened upon the palace floor its beam Yet the strong hand which propped that thoughtful head Sank not, nor moved. Sudden, King Sigebert Arose and spake: ‘I go to Heida's Tower: Await ye my return.’ The woods ere long Around him closed. Upon the wintry boughs An iron shadow pressed; and as the wind Increased beneath their roofs an iron sound Clangoured funereal. Down their gloomiest aisle With snow flakes white, the monarch strode till now Before him, and not distant, Heida's Tower, The Prophetess by all men feared yet loved Smit by a cold beam from the yellowing west, Shone like a tower of brass. Her ravens twain Crested the turrets of its frowning gate Unwatched by warder. Sigebert passed in: Beneath the stony vault the queenly Seer Sat on her ebon throne. With pallid lips The King rehearsed his tale; how one with brow Lordlier than man's, and visionary eyes ‘Whilst Sigebert still governed the kingdom there came out of Ireland a holy man named Fursey, renowned both for his words and actions, and remarkable for singular virtues, being desirous to live a stranger for Our Lord, wherever an opportunity should offer.... He built himself the monastery (Burghcastle in Suffolk) wherein he might with more freedom indulge his heavenly studies. There falling sick, as the book about his life informs us, he fell into a trance, and, quitting his body from the evening till the cockcrow, he was found worthy to behold the choirs of angels, and hear the praises which are sung in heaven.... He not only saw the greater joys of the Blessed, but also extraordinary combats of Evil Spirits.’—Bede, Hist., book iii. cap. xix. ‘C'etait un moine irlandais nommé Fursey, de très-noble naissance et célèbre depuis sa jeunesse dans son pays par sa science et ses visions.... Dans la principale de ses visions Ampère et Ozanam se sont accordés à reconnaitre une des sources poétiques de la Divine Comédie.’— Montalembert, Les Moines d'Occident, tome iv. pp. 93-4. Which, wander where they might, saw Spirits still Had told him many marvels of some God Mightier than Odin thrice. He paused awhile: A warning shadow came to Heida's brow: Nathless she nothing spake. The King resumed: ‘He spake—that stranger—of the things he saw: For he, his body tranced, it may be dead, In spirit oft hath walked the Spirit-Land: Thence, downward gazing, once he saw our earth A little vale obscure; above it hung, Those four great Fires that desolate mankind: The Fire of Falsehood first; the Fire of Lust, Ravening for weeds and scum; the Fire of Hate, Hurling on war-fields brother-man 'gainst man; The Fire of tyrannous Pride. While yet he gazed, Behold, those Fires, widening, commixed, then soared Threatening the skies. A Spirit near him cried “Fear nought; for breeze-like pass the flames o'er him In whom they won no mastery there below: But woe to those who, charioted therein Rode forth triumphant o'er the necks of men, And had their day on earth. Proportioned flames Of other edge shall try their work and them!” Thus spake my guest: the frost wind smote his brows, While on that moonlit crag we sat ice-cold Yet down them, like the reaper's sweat at noon, The drops of anguish streamed. Till then, methinks, That thing Sin is I knew not. Calm of voice Again he spake. He told me of his God: That God, like Odin, is a God of War: Who serve Him wear His armour day and night: The maiden, nay, the child, must wield the sword; Yet none may hate his neighbour. Thus he spake That Prophet from far regions: “Wherefore wreck Thy brother man? upon his innocent babes Drag down the ruinous roof? Seek manlier tasks! The death in battle is the easiest death: Be yours the daily dying; lifelong death; Death of the body that the soul may live. War on the Spirits unnumbered and accurst Which, rulers of the darkness of this world, Drive, hour by hour, their lances through man's soul That wits not of the wounding!”’ Heida turned A keen eye on the King: ‘Whence came your guest? Not from those sun-bright southern shores, I ween?’ He answered, ‘Nay, from western isle remote That Prophet came.’ Then Heida's countenance fell: ‘The West! the West! it should have been the East! Conclude your tale: what saith your guest of God?’ The King replied: ‘His God so loved mankind That, God remaining, He became a man; So hated sin that, sin to slay, He died. One tear of His had paid the dreadful debt:— Not so He willed it: thus He willed, to wake In man, His lost one, quenchless hate of sin Proportioned to the death-pang of a God; Nor chose He lonely majesty of death: 'Twixt Sinners paired He died.’ In Heida's eye Trembled a tear. ‘A dream was mine in youth, When first the rose of girlhood warmed my cheek, A dream of some great Sacrifice that claimed Not praise—not praise—it only yearned to die Helping the Loved. A maid alone, I thought, Such sacrifice could offer.’ As she spake, She pressed upon the pale cheek, warmed once more, Her cold, thin hand a moment. ‘Maiden-born Was He, my guest revealed,’ the King replied: ‘Then from that Angel's “Hail,” and her response, “So be it unto me,” when sinless doubt Vanished in world-renewing, free consent, He told the tale;—the Infant in the crib; The shepherds o'er Him bowed’—with widening eyes Heida, bent forward, saw like them that Child— ‘The Star that lead the Magians from the East:’ ‘The East, the East! It should have been the East!’ Once more she cried; ‘our race is from the East: The Persian worshipped t'ward the rising sun: You said, but now, the West.’ The King resumed: ‘God's priest was from the West; but in the East The great Deliverer sprang.’ Next, step by step, Like herald panting forth in leaguered town Tidings unhoped for of deliverance strange Through victory on some battle-field remote, The King rehearsed his theme, from that first Word, ‘The Woman's Seed shall bruise the Serpent's head,’ Prime Gospel, ne'er forgotten in the East, To Calvary's Cross, the Resurrection morn, Lastly the great Ascension into heaven: And ever as he spake on Heida's cheek The red spot, deepening, spread; within her eyes An unastonished gladness waxed more large: Back to the marble woman came her youth: Once more within her heaving breast it lived, Once more upon her forehead shone, as when The after-glow returns to Alpine snows Left death-like by dead day. Question at times She made, yet seemed the answer to foreknow. That tale complete, low-toned at last she spake: ‘Unhappy they to whom these things are hard!’ Then silent sat, and by degrees became Once more that dreaded prophet, stern and cold. The silence deeper grew: the sun, not set, Had sunk beneath the forest's western ridge; And jagged shadows tinged that stony floor Whereon the monarch knelt. Slowly therefrom He raised his head; then slowly made demand: ‘Is he Apostate who discards old Faith?’ Long time in musings Heida sat, then spake: ‘Yea, if that Faith discarded be the Truth: Not so, if it be falsehood. God is Truth; God-taught, true hearts discern that Truth, and guard it; Whom God forsakes forsake it. O thou North, That beat'st thy brand so loud against thy shield Hearing nought else, what Truth one day was thine! Behold within corruption's charnel vaults It sleeps this day. What God shall lift its head? We came from regions of the rising sun: Scorning the temples built by mortal hand, We worshipp'd God—one God—the Immense, All-Just: That worship was the worship of great hearts: Duty was worship then: that God received it: I know not if benignly He received it; If God be Love I know not. This I know, God loves not priest that under roofs of gold Lifts, in his right hand held, the Sacrifice; The left, behind him, fingering for the dole. King of East Anglia's realm, the primal Truths Are vanished from our Faith: the ensanguined rite, The insane carouse survive!’ Thus Heida spake, Heida, the strong one by the strong ones feared; Heida the sad one by the mourners loved, Heida, the brooder on the sacred Past, The nursling of a Prophet House, the child Of old traditions sage! She paused, and then Milder, resumed: ‘What moved thee to believe?’ And Sigebert made answer thus: ‘The Sword: For as a sword that Truth the stranger preached Ran down into my heart.’ Heida to him, ‘Well saidst thou “as a Sword:” a Sword is Truth;— As sharp a sword is Love: and many a time In youth, but not the earliest, happiest youth, When first I found that grief was in the world Had learned how deep its root, an infant's wail Went through me like a sword. Man's cry it seemed The blindfold, crownèd creature's cry for Truth His spirit's sole deliverer.’ Once again She mused and then continued, ‘Truth and Love Are gifts too great to give themselves for nought, Exacting Gods. Within man's bleeding heart, If e'er to man conceded, both shall lie Crossed, like two swords— Behold thine image, crowned Humanity! Better such dower than life exempt from woe: Our Fathers knew to suffer; joyed in pain; They knew not this—how deep its root!’ Once more The Prophetess was mute: again she spake: ‘How named thy guest his God?’ The King replied: ‘The Warrior God Who comes to judge the world; The Lord of Love; the God Who wars on Sin, And ceases not to war.’ ‘Ay, militant’ Heida rejoined, with eyes that shone like stars: ‘The Persian knew Him. Ormuzd was His name: Unpitying Light against the darkness warred; Against the Light the Darkness. Could the Light Remit, one moment's length, to pierce that gloom, Himself in gloom were swallowed.’ Yet again In silence Heida sat; then cried aloud ‘Odin, and all his radiant Æsir Gods Forth thronging daily from the golden gates Of Asgard City, their supernal house War on that giant brood of Jötunheim, Lodged 'mid their mountains of eternal ice Which circles still that sea surrounding earth Man's narrow home. I know that mystery now! That warfare means the war of Good on Ill: We shared that warfare once! This day, depraved, Warring, we war alone for rage and hate; Men fight as fight the lion and the pard: For them the sanctity of war is lost Lost like that kindred sanctity of Love, Our household boast of old. The Father-God Vowed us to battle but as Virtue's proof, High test of softness scorned. His warrior knew 'Twas Odin o'er the battle field who sent Pure-handed maiden Goddesses, the Norns, Not vulture-like, but dove-like, mild as dawn, To seal the foreheads of his sons elect Seal them to death, the bravest with a kiss: His warrior, arming, cried aloud, “This day I speed five Heroes to Valhalla's Hall: To-morrow night in love I share their Feast!” He honoured whom he slew.’ To her the King: ‘That Stranger with severer speech than thine, Sharp flail and stigma, charged the world with sin, The vast, wide world, and not one race alone: Each nation, he proclaimed, from Man's great stem Issuing, had with it borne one Word divine Rapt from God's starry volume in the skies, Each word a separate Truth, that, angel-like, Before them winging, on their faces flung Splendour of destined morn, and led man's race Triumphant long on virtue's road. Themselves Had changed that True to False. The Judge had come; That Power Who both beginning is and end Had stooped to earth to judge the earth with fire; A fire of Love, He came to cleanse the just; A fire of Vengeance, to consume the impure: His fan is in His hand: the chaff shall burn; The grain be garnered. “Fall, high palace roofs” He cried, “for ye have sheltered dens of sin: Fall, he that, impious, scorned the First and Last; Fall, he that bowed not to the hoary head; Fall, he that loosed by fraud the maiden zone; Fall, he that lusted for the poor man's field; Fall, rebel Peoples; fall, disloyal Kings; And fall” dread Mother, is the word offence?— “False Gods, long served; for God Himself is night.”’ The monarch ceased: on Heida's face that hour He feared to look; but when she spake, her voice Betrayed no passion of a soul perturbed: Austere it was; not wrathful; these her words: ‘Son, as I hearkened to thy tale this day Memory returned to me of visions three That lighted three great junctures of my life: And thrice thy words were echoes strange of words That shook my tender childhood slumbering half Half-waked by matin beams—“The Gods must die.” Three times that awful sound was in mine ear: Later I learned that voice was nothing new. My Son, the earliest record of our Faith, So sacred that on Runic stave or stone None dared to grave it, lore from age to age Transmitted by white lips of trembling seers Spared not to wing, like arrow sped from God That word to man, “Valhalla's Gods must die!” The Gods and Giant Race that strove so long, Met in their last and mightiest battle-field, Must die, and die one death. That prophet-voice The Gods have heard. Therefore they daily swell Valhalla's Hall with heroes rapt from earth To aid them in that fight.’ On Heida's face At last the King, his head uplifting, gazed. There where the inviolate calm had dwelt alone A million thoughts, each following each, on swept, That calm beneath them still, as when some grove O'er-run by sudden gust of summer storm With inly-working panic thrills at first, Then springs to meet the gale while o'er it rush Shadows with splendours mixed. Upon her breast Came down the fire divine. With lifted hands She stood: she sang a death-song centuries old The dirge prophetic both of Gods and men: ‘The iron age shall make an iron end: The men who lived in hate, or impious love, Shall meet in one red battle-field. That day The forests of the earth, blackening, shall die; The stars down-fall; the Wingèd Hound of Heaven That chased the Sun from age to age shall close O'er it at last; the Ash Tree, Ygdrasil Whose boughs o'er-roof the skies, whose roots descend To Hell, whose leaves are lives of men, whose boughs Are destined empires that o'er-awe the world, Shall drop its fruit unripe. The Midgard Snake Circling that sea which girds the orb of earth, Shall wake, and turn, and ocean in one wave O'er-sweep all lands. Thereon shall Naglfar ride, The skeleton ship all ribbed with bones of men, Whose sails are woven of night, and by whose helm Stand the Three Fates. When heaves that ship in sight Then know the end draws night.’ She ceased; then spake: ‘If any doubt, the Voluspá tells all, The song the mystic maiden, Vola, sang, Our first of prophets she, as I the last: She sang that song no Prophet dared to write.’ But Sigebert made answer where he knelt, Old Faith back rushing blindly on his heart: ‘Though man's last nation lay a wreath of dust, Though earth were sea, not less in heaven the Gods Would hold their revels still; Valhalla's Halls Resound the Heroes' triumph!’ Once again Heida arose: once more her pallid face Shone lightning-like, wan cheeks and flashing eyes; Once more she sang: ‘The Warder of the Gods, Soundeth the Gjallar Trumpet, never heard Before by Gods or mortals: from their feast The everlasting synod of the Gods Rush forth, gold-armed, with chariot and with horse: First rides the Father of the flock divine, Odin, our King, and, at his right hand, Thor Whose thunder hammer splits the mountain crags And level lays the summits of the world; Heimdall and Bragi, Uller, Njord, and Tyr, Behind them throng; with these the concourse huge Of lesser Gods, and Heroes snatched from earth Since man's first battle, part to bear with Gods In this their greatest. From their halls of ice To meet them stride the mighty Giant-Brood The moving mountains of old Jötunheim, Strong with all strengths of Nature, flood or fire, Glacier, or stream volcanic from red hills Cutting its way through billows;—on they throng Topping the clouds, and, leagues before them, flinging Huge shade, like shade of mountains cast o'er wastes When sets the sun.’ A little time she ceased; Then fiercelier sang: ‘Flanking that Giant-Brood I see two Portents terrible as Sin:— The Midgard Snake primeval at the right With demon-crest as haughtily upheaved As though all ocean curled into one wave, A million rainbows braid that glooming arch; And Death therein is mirrored. At the left, On moves that brother Terror, wolf in shape, Which, bound till now by craft of prescient Gods, Weltered in Hell's abyss. Till came the hour A single hair inwoven by heavenly hand Sufficed to chain that monster to his rock; His fast is over now; his dusky jaws At last the Eternal Hunger lifts distent As far as heaven from earth.’ The Prophetess One moment pressed her palms upon her eyes Then flung them wide. ‘The Father of the Gods Our Odin, at that Portent hurls his lance; And Thor, though bleeding fast, with hammer raised Deals with that Serpent's scales.’ ‘The Gods shall win,’ Shouted the King, forgetting at that hour All save the strife, while on his brow there burned Hue of the battle at the battle's height When no man staunches wound. With voice serene (The storm had left her) Heida made reply: ‘If any doubt, the Voluspá tells all. Ere yet Valhalla's lower heaven was shaped Muspell, the great Third Heaven immeasurable, Above it towered, throne of that God Supreme Who knew beginning none and knows no end: High on its southern cliff that dread One sits, Nor ever from the South withdraws His gaze, Nor ever drops that bright, sky-pointing Sword Whose splendour dims the noontide sun. That God— He, and the Spirit-Host that wing His light When shines the Judgment Sign, shall stand on earth And judge the earth with fire. Nor men nor Gods Shall face that fire and live.’ As Heida spake The broad full moon above the forest soared And changed her form to light. With hands outstretched She sang her last of songs: ‘The Hour is come: Bifrost, the rainbow-bridge 'twixt heaven and earth Shatters; the crystal walls of heaven roll in: Above the ruins ride the Sons of Light. That dread One first— Forth from His helm the intolerable beam Strikes to the battle-field; the Giant-Brood Die in that flame; and Odin, and his Gods: Valhalla falls, and with it Jötunheim, Its ice-piled mountains melting into waves: In fire are all things lost!’ Then wept the King: ‘Alas for Odin and his brethren Gods That in their great hands stayed the Northern Land! Alas for man!’ But Heida, with fixed face Whereon there sat its ancient calm, replied: ‘Nothing that lived but shall again have life, Such life as Virtue claims. Ill-working men With Loki and with Hela, evil Gods, Shall dwell far down in Náströnd's death-black pile Compact of serpent scales, whose thousand gates Face to the North, blinded by endless storm; But from the sea shall rise a happier earth, Holier and happier. There the good and true Secure shall gladden, and the fiery flame Harm them no more. Another Asgard there Where stood that earlier, ere our fathers left Their native East, shall lift sublimer towers Dawn-lighted by a loftier Ararat: Just men and pure shall pace its palmy steeps With him of race divine yet human heart, Baldur upon whose beaming front the Gods Gazing, exulted; from whose lips mankind Shall gather counsel. Hand in hand with him Shall stand the blind God, Hödur, now not blind, That, witless, slew him with the mistletoe, Yet loved him well. Others, both men and Gods That dread Third Heaven attained, shall make abode With Him Who ever is, and ever was, Enthroned like Him upon its southern cliff, Drinking the light immortal. From beneath Like winds from flowery wildernesses borne, The breath of all good deeds and virtuous thoughts Their own, or others', since the worlds were made All generous sufferings, o'er their hearts shall hang, Fragrance perpetual; and, where'er they gaze The Vision of their God shall on them shine.’ Thus Heida spake, and ceased; then added, ‘Son, Our Faith shall never suffer wreck: fear nought! Fulfilment, not Destruction, is its end. But thou return, and bid thy herald guest Who sought thee, wandering from his westward Isle Approach my gates at dawn, and in mine ear Divulge his message to this land. Farewell!’ Then from his knees the monarch rose, and took Through the huge moonlit woods his homeward way. KING SIGEBERT OF ESSEX, OR A FRIEND AT NEED. Sigebert, King of Essex, labours with Cedd the Bishop for the conversion of his people; but he feasts with a certain impious kinsman; and it is foretold to him that for that sin, though pardoned, he shall die by that kinsman's hand. This prophecy having been accomplished, Cedd betakes himself to Lastingham, there to pray with his three brothers for the King's soul. His prayer is heard, and in a few days he dies. Thirty of Cedd's monks, issuing from Essex to pray at his grave, die also, and are buried in a circle round it. ‘At last, resolve, my brother, and my friend! Fling from you, as I fling this cloak, your Gods And cleave to Him the Eternal, One and Sole, The All-Wise, All-Righteous and Illimitable, Who made us, and will judge.’ Thus Oswy spake To Sigebert, his friend, of Essex King Essex once Christian. Royal Sebert dead, The church of God had sorrow by the Thames: Three Pagan brothers in his place held sway: They warred upon God's people; for which cause God warred on them and by the Wessex sword In one day hewed them down. King Sigebert Throned in their place, to Oswy thus replied: ‘O friend, I saw the Truth, yet saw it not! 'Twas like the light forth flashed from oar remote, Now vivid, vanished now. Not less, methinks Thy Christ ere now had won me save for this; I feared that in my bosom love for thee Not Truth alone, prevailed. I left thy court; I counselled with my wisest; by degrees, Though grieving thus to outrage loyal hearts Reached my resolve: henceforth I serve thy God: My kingdom may renounce me if it will.’ Then came the Bishop old, and nigh that Wall Which spans the northern land from sea to sea Baptized him to the God Triune. At night The King addressed him thus: ‘My task is hard; Yield me four priests of thine from Holy Isle To shape my courses.’ Finan gazed around And made election—Cedd and others three; He consecrated Cedd with staff and ring; And by the morning's sunrise Sigebert Rode with them, face to south. The Spring, long checked, Fell, like God's Grace, or fire, or flood, at once O'er all the land: it swathed the hills in green; It fringed with violets cleft and rock; illumed The stream with primrose tufts: but mightier far That Spring which triumphed in the monarch's breast, All doubt dispelled. That smile which knew not cause Looked like his angel's mirrored on his face: At times he seemed with utter gladness dazed; At times he laughed aloud. ‘Father,’ he cried, ‘That darkness from my spirit is raised at last: Ah fool! ah fool! to wait for proof so long! Unseal thine eyes, and all things speak of God: The snows on yonder thorn His pureness show; Yon golden iris bank His love. But now I marked a child that by its father ran: Some mystery they seemed of love in heaven Imaged in earthly love.’ With sad, sweet smile The old man answered: ‘Pain there is on earth— Bereavement, sickness, death.’ The King replied: ‘It was by suffering, not by deed, or word God's Son redeemed mankind.’ Then answered Cedd: ‘God hath thee in His net; and well art thou! That Truth thou seest this day and feelest, live! So shall it live within thee. If, more late, Rebuke should come, or age, remember then This day-spring of thy strength and answer thus, “With me God feasted in my day of youth: So feast He now with others!”’ Years went by, And Cedd in work and word was mighty still And throve with God. The strong East Saxon race Grew gentle in his presence: they were brave And faith is courage in the things divine, Courage with meekness blent. The heroic heart Beats to the spiritual cognate, paltering not Fraudulent with Truth once known. Like winds from God God's message on them fell. Old bonds of sin Snapt by the vastness of the growing soul Burst of themselves; and in the heart late bound Virtue had room to breathe. As when that Voice Primeval o'er the formless chaos rolled, And, straight, confusions ceased, the greater orb Ruling the day, the lesser, night; even so, Born of that Bethlehem Mystery, Order lived: Divine commandments fixed a firmament Betwixt man's lower instincts and his mind: From unsuspected summits of his Spirit The morning shone. The nation with the man Partook the joy: from duty freedom flowed; And there where tribes had roved a People lived. A pathos of strange beauty hung thenceforth O'er humblest hamlet: he who passed it prayed ‘May never sword come here!’ Bishop and King Together laboured: well that Bishop's love Repaid that royal zeal. If random speech Censured the King, though justly, sudden red Circling the old man's silver-tressèd brow Showed, though he spake not, that in saintly breast The human heart lived on. In Ithancester He dwelt, and toiled: not less to Lindisfarne, His ancient home in spirit oft he yearned Longing for converse with his God alone; And made retreat there often, not to shun Labour allotted, but to draw from heaven Strength for his task. One year, returning thence, Dëira's King addressed him as they rode: ‘My father, choose the richest of my lands And build thereon a holy monastery; So shall my realm be blessed, and I, and mine.’ He answered: ‘Son, no wealthy lands for us! Spake not the prophet: “There where dragons roamed, In later days the grass shall grow—the reed”? I choose those rocky hills that, on our left Drag down the skiey waters to the woods: Such loved I from my youth; to me they said, “Bandits this hour usurp our heights, and beasts Cumber our caves: expel the seed accurst, And yield us back to God!”’ The King gave ear; And Cedd within those mountains passed his Lent, Driving with prayer and fast the Spirits Accurst With ignominy forth. Foundations next He laid with sacred pomp. Fair rose the walls: All day the March sea blew its thunder blasts Through wide-mouthed trumpets of ravine or rift On winding far to where in wooden cell The old man prayed, while o'er him rushed the cloud Storm borne from crag to crag. Serener breeze, With alternation soft in Nature's course, Following ere long, great Easter's harbinger, Thus spake he; ‘I must keep the Feast at home; My children there expect me.’ Parting thence, He left his brothers three to consummate His work begun, Celin, and Cynabil, And Chad at Lichfield Bishop ere he died. Thus Lastingham had birth. Beside the Thames Meantime dark deeds were done. There dwelt two thanes, The kinsmen of the King, his friends in youth, Of meanest friend unworthy. Far and wide They ravined, and the laws of God and man Despised alike. Three times, in days gone by, A warning hand their Bishop o'er them raised; The fourth like bolt from heaven on them it fell, And clave them from God's Church. They heeded not: And now the elder kept his birthday feast, Summoning his friends around him, first the King. Doubtful and sad, the o'er-gentle monarch mused: ‘To feast with sinners is to sanction sin, A deed abhorred; the alternative is hard: Must then their sovereign shame with open scorn Kinsman and friend? I think they mourn the past, And, were our Bishop here, would pardon sue.’ Boding, yet self-deceived, he joined that feast: Thereat he saw scant sign of penitence: Ere long he bade farewell. That self-same hour Cedd from his northern pilgrimage returned; The monarch met him at the offenders' gate, And, instant when he saw that reverend face, His sin before him stood. Down from his horse Leaping, he told him all, and penance prayed. Long time the old man on that royal front Fixed a sad eye. ‘Thy sin was great, my son, Shaming thy God to spare a sinner's shame: That sin thy God forgives and I remit: But those whom God forgives He chastens oft: My son, I see a sign upon thy brow! Ere yonder lessening moon completes her wane Behold, the blood-stained hand late clasped in thine Shall drag thee to thy death.’ The King replied: ‘A Sigebert there lived, East Anglia's King, Whose death was glorious to his realm. May mine, Dark and inglorious, strengthen hearts infirm, And profit thus my land.’ A time it was When Christian mercy judged by Pagan hearts Not virtue seemed but sin. That sin's reproach The King had long sustained. Ere long it chanced That, near the stronghold of that impious feast, A vanquished rebel, long in forests hid Drew near, and knelt to Sigebert for grace And won his suit. The monarch's kinsmen twain, Those men of blood, forth-gazing from a tower Saw all; heard all. Upon them fury fell, As when through cloudless skies there comes a blast From site unknown, that, instant, finds its prey, Circling some white-sailed bark or towering tree And, with a touch, down-wrenching; all things else Unharmed, though near. They snatched their daggers up, And rushed upon their prey, and, shouting thus ‘White-livered slave, that mak'st thy throne a jest And mock'st great Odin's self, and us thy kin, To please thy shaveling’ struck him through the heart; Then, spurring through the woodlands to the sea, Were never heard of more. Throughout the land Lament was made; lament in every house, As though in each its eldest-born lay dead; Lament far off and near. The others wept: Cedd, in long vigils of the lonely night, Not wept alone, but lifted strength of prayer And, morn by morn, that Sacrifice Eterne, Mightier tenfold in impetrative power Than prayers of all man's race, from Adam's first To his who latest on the Judgment Day Shall raise his hands to God. Four years went by: That mourner's wound they staunched not. Oft in sleep He murmured low, ‘Would I had died for thee!’ And once, half-waked by rush of morning rains, ‘Why saw I on his brow that fatal sign?— He might have lived till now!’ Within his heart At last there rose a cry, ‘To Lastingham! Pray with thy brothers three, for saints are they: So shall thy friend, who resteth in the Lord With perfect will submiss, the waiting passed, Gaze on God's Vision with an eye unscaled, In glory everlasting.’ At that thought Peace on the old man settled. Staff in hand Forth on his way he fared. Nor horse he rode Nor sandals wore. He walked with feet that bled, Paying, well pleased, that penance for his King; And murmured ofttimes, ‘Not my blood alone! Nay, but my life, my life!’ Yet penance pain Like pain of suffering Souls at peace with God, Quelled not that gladness which, from secret source Rising, o'erflowed his heart. Old times returned: Once more beside him rode his King in youth Southward to where his realm—his duty—lay, Exulting captive of the Saviour Lord, With face love-lit. As then, the vernal prime Hourly with ampler respiration drew Delight of purer green from balmier airs: As then the sunshine glittered. By their path Now hung the woodbine; now the hare-bell waved; Rivulets new-swollen by melted snows, and birds 'Mid echoing boughs with rival rapture sang: At times the monks forgat their Christian hymns, By humbler anthems charmed. They gladdened more Beholding oft in cottage doors cross-crowned Angelic faces, or in lonely ways; Once as they passed there stood a little maid, Some ten years old, alone 'mid lonely pines, With violet crowned and primrose. Who were those, The forest's white-robed guests, she nothing knew; Not less she knelt. With hand uplifted Cedd Signed her his blessing. Hand she kissed in turn; Then waved, yet ceased not from her song, ‘Alone Two lovers sat at sunset.’ Every eve Some village gave the wanderers food and rest, Or half-built convent with its church thick-walled And polished shafts, great names in after times Ely, and Croyland, Southwell, Medeshamstede, Adding to sylvan sweetness holier grace Or rising lonely o'er morass and mere With bowery thickets isled where dogwood brake Retained, though late, its red. To Boston near Where Ouse, and Aire, and Derwent join with Trent, And salt sea waters mingle with the fresh They met a band of youths that o'er the sands Advanced with psalm, cross-led. The monks rejoiced, Save one from Ireland—Dicul. He, quick-eared Had caught that morn a war-cry on the wind And, sideway glancing from his Office-book, Descried the cause. From Mercia's realm a host Had crossed Northumbria's bound. His thin, worn face O'er-flamed with sudden anger, thus he cried: ‘In this, your land, men say, “Who worketh prayeth,” In mine we say, “Well prays who fighteth well:” A Pagan race treads down your homesteads! Slaves, That close not with their throats!’ Advancing thus, On the tenth eve they came to Lastingham: Forth rushed the brethren, watching long far off To meet them, first the brothers three of Cedd Who kissed him, cheek and mouth. Gladly that night Those foot-worn travellers laid them down and slept Save one alone. Old Cedd his vigil made And, kneeling by the tabernacle's lamp Prayed for the man he mourned for, ending thus: ‘Thou Lord of Souls, to Thee the Souls are dear! Thou yearn'st toward them as they yearn to Thee; Behold, not prayer alone for him I raise: I offer Thee my life.’ When morning's light In that great church commingled with its gloom, The monks, slow-pacing, by that kneeler knelt, And prayed for Sigebert, beloved of God; And lastly offered Mass: and it befell That when, the Offering offered, and the Dead Rightly remembered, he who sang that Mass Had reached the ‘Nobis quoque famulis,’ There came to Cedd an answer from the Lord Heard in his heart; and he beheld his King Throned 'mid the Saints Elect of God who keep Perpetual triumph, and who see that Face Which to its likeness hourly more compels Those faces t'ward It turned. That function o'er, Thus spake the Bishop: ‘Brethren, sing “Te Deum;”’ They sang it; while within him he replied, ‘Lord, let Thy servant now depart in peace.’ A week passed by with gladness winged and prayer. In wonder Cedd beheld those structures new From small beginnings reared, though many a gift Sent for that work's behoof, had fed the poor In famine time laid low. Moorlands he saw By cornfields vanquished; marked the all-beauteous siege Of pasture yearly threatening loftier crags Loud with the bleat of lambs. Their shepherd once Had roved a bandit, next had toiled a slave, Now with both hands he poured his weekly wage Down on his young wife's lap, his pretty babes Gambolling around for joy. A hospital Stood by the convent's gate. With moistened eye Musing on Him Who suffers in His sick, The Bishop paced it. There he found his death: That year a plague had wasted all the land: It reached him. Late that night he said, ‘'Tis well!’ In three days more he lay with hands death-cold Crossed on a peaceful breast. Like winter cloud Borne through dark air, that portent feared of man Ill tidings, making way with mystic speed, Shadowed ere long the troubled bank of Thames, And spread a wailing round its Minsters twain Saint Peter's and Saint Paul's. Saint Alban's caught That cry, and northward echoed. Southward soon Forlorn it rang 'mid towers of Rochester; Then seaward died. But in that convent pile Wherein so long the Saint had made abode A different grief there lived, a deeper grief, That grief which part hath none in sobs or tears— Which needs must act. There thirty monks arose And, taking each his staff, made vow thenceforth To serve God's altar where their father died Or share his grave. Through Ithancester's gate As forth they paced between two kneeling crowds, A little homeless boy, who heard their dirge (Late orphaned, at its grief he marvelled not), So loved them that he followed, shorter steps Doubling 'gainst theirs. At first the orphan wept: That mood relaxed: before them now he ran To pluck a flower; as oft he lagged behind The wild bird's song so aptly imitating That, by his music drawn, or by his looks, That bird at times forgat her fears, and perched Pleased on his arm. As flower and bird to him Such as those monks the child. Better each day He loved them; yet, revering, still he mocked, And though he mocked, he kissed. The westering sun On the eighth eve from towers of Lastingham Welcomed those strangers. In another hour, Well-nigh arrived, they saw that grave they sought Sole on the church's northern slope. As when, Some father, absent long, returns at last, His children rush loud-voiced from field to house, And cling about his knees; and they that mark— Old reaper, bent no more, with hook in hand, Or ploughman leaning 'gainst the old blind horse Beholding wonder not; so to that grave Rushed they; so clung. Around that grave ere long Their own were ranged. That plague which smote the sire Spared not his sons. With ministering hand From pallet still to pallet passed the boy, Now from the dark spring wafting colder draught Now moistening fevered lips, or on the brow Spreading the new-bathed cincture. Him alone The infection reached not. When the last was gone He felt as though the earth, man's race—yea, God Himself—were dead. Around he gazed and spake ‘Why then do I remain?’ From hill to hill, The monks on reverend offices intent, All solitary oft that boy repaired, From each in turn forth gazing, fain to learn If friend were t'wards him nighing. Many a hearth More late, bereavement's earlier anguish healed, Welcomed the creature: many a mother held The milk-bowl to his mouth in both hands stayed, With smile the deeper for the draught prolonged, And lodged, as he departed, in his hand Her latest crust. With children of his age Seldom he played. That convent gave him rest; Nor lost he aught surviving thus his friends, Since childhood's sacred innocence he kept While life remained, unspotted. When mature Five years he lived there monk, and reverence drew. To that high convent through his saintly ways; Then died. Within that cirque of thirty graves They laid him, close to Cedd. In later years, Because they ne'er could learn his name or race, Nor yet forget his gentle looks, the name Of Deodatus graved they on his tomb. KING OSWALD OF NORTHUMBRIA, OR THE BRITON'S REVENGE. Northumbria having been subdued by Pagan Mercia, Oswald raises there again the Christian standard. Penda wages war against him, in alliance with Cadwallon, a Cambrian prince who hates the Saxon conquerors the more bitterly when become Christians. Encouraged by St. Columba in a vision, Oswald with a small force vanquishes the hosts of Cadwallon, who is slain. He sends to Iona for monks of St. Columba's order, converts his country to the Faith, and dies for her. The carlier British race expiates its evil revenge. The agony was over which but late Had shook to death Northumbria's realm new-raised By Edwin, dear to God. The agony At last was over; but the tear flowed on: The Faith of Christ had fallen once more to dust That Faith which spoused with golden marriage ring The land to God, when Coiffi, horsed and mailed, Chief Priest himself, hurled at the Temple's wall His lance, and quivering left it lodged therein. The agony had ceased; yet Rachael's cry Still pierced the childless region. Penda's sword Had swept it, Mercia's Christian-hating King; Fiercelier Cadwallon's, Cambria's Christian Prince, Christian in vain. The British wrong like fire Burned in his heart. Well-nigh two hundred years That British race, they only of the tribes By Rome subdued, sustained unceasing war 'Gainst those barbaric hordes that, nursed long since 'Mid Teuton woods, when Rome her death-wound felt, And ‘Habet’ shrilled from every trampled realm, Rushed forth in ruin o'er her old domain:— That race against the Saxon still made head; Large remnant yet survived. The Western coast Was theirs; old sea-beat Cornwall's granite cliffs, And purple hills of Cambria; northward thence Strathclyde, from towered Carnegia's winding Dee To Morecambe's shining sands, and those fair vales Since loved by every muse, where silver meres Slept in the embrace of yew-clad mountain walls; With tracts of midland Britain and the East. Remained the memory of the greatness lost; The Druid circles of the olden age; The ash-strewn cities radiant late with arts Extinct this day; bath, circus, theatre Mosaic-paved; the Roman halls defaced; The Christian altars crushed. That last of wrongs The vanquished punished with malign revenge: Never had British priest to Saxon preached; And when that cry was heard, ‘The Saxon King Edwin hath bowed to Christ,’ on Cambrian hills Nor man nor woman smiled. They had not lacked The timely warning. From his Kentish shores Augustine stretched to them paternal hands: Later, he sought them out in synod met, Their custom, under open roof of heaven. ‘The Mother of the Churches,’ thus he spake ‘Commands—implores you! Seek from her, and win The Sacrament of Unity Divine! Thus strengthened, be her strength! With her conjoined Subdue your foe to Christ!’ He sued in vain. The British bishops hurled defiance stern Against his head, while Cambrian peaks far off Darkened, and thunder muttered. From his seat, Slowly and sadly as the sun declined At last, though late, that Roman rose and stretched A lean hand t'ward that circle, speaking thus: ‘Hear then the sentence of your God on sin! Because ye willed not peace, behold the sword! Because ye grudged your foe the Faith of Christ Nor holp to lead him on the ways of life, For that cause from you by the Saxon hand Your country shall be taken!’ Edwin slain, Far off in exile dwelt his nephews long Oswald and Oswy. Alba gave them rest, Alba, not yet called Scotland. Ireland's sons, Then Scoti named, had warred on Alba's Picts: Columba's Gospel vanquished either race; Won both to God. It won not less those youths In boyhood Oswald, Oswy still a child. That child was wild and hot, and had his moods, Despotic now, now mirthful. Mild as Spring Was Oswald's soul, majestic and benign; Thoughtful his azure eyes, serene his front; He of his ravished sceptre little recked; The shepherds were his friends: the mountain deer Would pluck the ivy fearless from his hand: In gladness walked he till Northumbria's cry Smote on his heart. ‘Why rest I here in peace,’ Thus mused he, ‘while my brethren groan afar?’ By night he fled with twelve companion youths Christians like him and reached his native land. Too fallen it seemed to aid him. On he passed; The ways were desolate, yet evermore A slender band around his footsteps drew Less seeking victory than an honest death. Oft gazed their King upon them; murmured oft, ‘Few hands—true hearts!’ Sudden aloud he cried ‘Plant here the royal Standard, friends, and hence Let sound the royal trumpet.’ Stern response Reached him ere long: not Mercia's realm alone; Cambria that heard the challenge joined the war: Cambria, upon whose heart the ancestral woe For ever with the years, like letters graved On growing pines, grew larger and more large;— To Penda forth she stretched a hand blood-red; Christian with Pagan joined, an unblest bond, A league accursed. The indomitable hate Compelled that league. Still from his cave the Seer Admonished, ‘Set the foe against the foe; Slay last the conqueror!’ and from rock and hill The Bard cried, ‘Vengeance!’ In the bardic clan That hatred of their country's ancient bane Lived like a faith. One night it chanced a tarn Secreted high 'mid cold and moonless hills Bursting its bank down burst. That valley's Bard Clomb to the church-roof from his buried house: Thence rang his song,—'twas ‘Vengeance!—Vengeance’ still! That torrent reached the roof: he clomb the tower: The torrent mounted: on the bleak hill-side All night the dalesmen, wailing o'er their drowned Amid the roar of winds and downward rocks Still heard that war-song, ‘Vengeance! Blood for blood!’ At last the tower fell flat, and winter morn Shone on the waters only. Three short weeks Dinned with alarums passed; in Mercia still Lay Penda, sickness-struck, when, face to face The Cambrian host and Oswald's little band Exulting met at sunset near a height Then ‘Heaven-Field’ named, but later ‘Oswald's Field,’ Backed by that Wall the Roman built of old His fence from sea to sea. There Oswald stood: There raised with hands outstretched a mighty Cross, Strong-based, and deep in earth: his comrades twelve Around it heaped the soil, while priests white-stoled Chanted ‘Vexilla Regis.’ Work and rite Complete, the King knelt down and made his prayer, ‘True God Eternal, look upon this Cross, The sole now standing on Northumbria's breast And help Thine own, though few, who trust in Thee!’ That night before his tent the wanderer sate Listening the circling sentinel, or bay Of wakeful hound remote, or downward course Of streams from moorland hills. Before his view His whole life rose: his father's angry brow; The eyes all-wondrous, and all-tender hand Of her, his mother, striving evermore To keep betwixt her husband and her sire Unbroken bond: his exiled days returned, The kind that pitied them, the rude that jeered; Lastly, that monk whose boast was evermore Columba of Iona, Columkille; That monk who made him Christian. ‘Come what may,’ Thus Oswald mused, ‘I have not lived in vain: Lose I or win, a kingdom there remains; Though not on earth!’ A tear the vision dimmed As thus he closed, ‘My mother will be there!’ Then sank his lids in slumber. On his sleep Was this indeed but dream?—a glory brake: Columba, dear to Oswald from his youth Columba, clad in glory as the sun Beside him stood and spake: ‘Be strong! On earth There lives not who can guess the might of prayer: What then is prayer on high?’ The saintly Shape Heavenward his hands upraised while rose to heaven His stature, towering ever high and higher, Warlike and priestly both. As morning cloud Blown by a mighty wind his robe ran forth, Then stood, a golden wall that severance made 'Twixt Oswald's band and that unnumbered host. Again he spake, ‘Put on thee heart of man And fight: though few, thy warriors shall not die In darkness of an unbelieving land But live, and live to God.’ The vision passed: By Oswald's seat his warriors stood and cried ‘The Bull-horn! Hark!’ The monarch told them all: They answered, ‘Let thy God sustain thy throne: Thenceforth our God is He.’ The sun uprose: Ere long the battle joined. Three dreadful hours Doubtful the issue hung. Fierce Cambria's sons With chief and clan, with harper and with harp, Though terrible yet mirthful in their mood, Rushed to their sport. Who mocked their hope that day? Did Angels help the just? Their falling blood, Say, leaped it up once more, each drop a man Their phalanx to replenish? Backward driven, Again that multitudinous foe returned With clangour dire; futile, again fell back Down dashed, like hailstone showers from palace halls Where princes feast secure. Astonishment Smote them at last. Through all those serried ranks, Compact so late, sudden confusions ran Like lines divergent through a film of ice Stamped on by armèd heel, or rifts on plains Prescient of earthquake underground. Their chiefs Sounded the charge;—in vain: Distrust, Dismay, Ill Gods, the darkness lorded of that hour: Panic to madness turned. Cadwallon sole From squadron on to squadron speeding still As on a wingèd steed—his snow-white hair Behind him blown—a mace in either hand, Stayed while he might the inevitable rout; Then sought his death, and found. Some fated Power Mightier than man's that hour dragged back his hosts Against their will and his: as when the moon Shrouded herself, drags back the great sea-tides That needs must follow her receding wheels Though wind and wave gainsay them, breakers wan Thundering indignant down nocturnal shores, And city-brimming floods against their will Down drawn to river-mouths. In after days Who scaped made oath that in the midmost fight The green earth sickened with a brazen glare While darkness held the skies. They saw besides On Heaven-Field height a Cross, and, at its foot, A sworded warrior vested like a priest Who still in stature high and higher towered As raged the battle. Higher far that Cross Above him rose, barring with black the stars That bickered through the eclipse's noonday night, And ever from its bleeding arms sent forth Thick-volleyed lightnings, azure fork and flame, Through all that headlong host. At eventide, Where thickest fight had mingled, Oswald stood With raiment red as his who treads alone The wine-vat when the grapes are all pressed out, Yet scathless and untouched. His mother's smile Was radiant on his pure and youthful face, Joyous, but not exulting. At his foot Cadwallon lay, with four-score winters white, A threatening corse: not death itself could shake The mace from either rigid hand close-clenched, Or smooth his brow. Above him Oswald bent, Then spake: ‘He also loved his native land: Bear him with honour hence to hills of Wales, And lay him with his Fathers.’ Thus was raised In righteousness King Oswald's throne. But he, Mindful in victory of Columba's word, Thus mused, ‘The Master is as he that serves: How shall I serve this people?’ O'er the waves Then sent he of his Twelve the eldest three: They to Iona sailed, and standing there In full assembly of Iona's Saints Addressed them: ‘To Columba Oswald thus: Let him that propped the King on Heaven-Field's height, That held the battle-balance high that day, Unite my realm to Christ!’ The monks replied, ‘Such mission should be Aidan's.’ Aidan went. With gladness Oswald met him, and with gifts: But Aidan said, ‘Entreat me not to dwell There where Paulinus dwelt, the man of God, In thy chief city, York. Thy race is fierce; And meekness only can subdue the proud: Thy people first I want; through them the great. Grant me some island 'mid the raging main Humble and low, not cheered by smiling meads, Where with my brethren I may watch with God, Henceforth my only aid.’ Oswald replied ‘Let Lindisfarne be thine. That rock-based keep Built by my grandsire Ida o'er it peers: I shall be near thee though I see thee not.’ Then Aidan on the Isle of Lindisfarne Upreared that monastery which ruled in Christ So long the Northern realm. A plain rock-girt Level it lies and low: nor flower nor fruit Gladdens its margin: thin its sod, and bleak: Twice, day by day, the salt sea hems it round: And twice a day the melancholy sands, O'er-wailed by sea-bird, and with sea-weed strewn, Replace the lonely ocean. Sacred Isles That westward, eastward, guard the imperial realm, Iona! Lindisfarne! With you compared How poor that lilied Delos of old Greece For all its laurel bowers and nightingales! England's great hands were ye to God forth stretched Through adverse climes, beneath the Boreal star, That took His Stigmata. In sanctity Were her foundations laid. Her later crowns Of Freedom first, of Science, and of Song She owes them all to you! In Lindisfarne Aidan, and his, rejoicing dwelt with God: Amid the winter storm their anthems rose; And from their sanctuary lamp the gleam Far shone from wave to wave. On starless nights From Bamborough's turret Oswald watched it long, Before his casement kneeling—first alone, Companioned later. Kineburga there Beside him knelt ere long, his tender bride, Young, beauteous, modest, noble. ‘Not for them,’ Thus spake the newly wedded, ‘not for them, For man's sake severed from the world of men, In ceaseless vigil warring upon sin, Ah, not for them the flower of life, the harp, High feast, or bridal torch!’ Purer perchance Their bridal torch burned on because from far That sacred lamp had met its earliest beam! There Aidan lived, and wafted issuing thence O'er wilds Bernician and fierce battle-fields The strength majestic of his still retreat, The puissance of a soul whose home was God. ‘What man is this,’ the warriors asked, ‘that moves Unarmed among us; lifts his crucifix, And says, “Ye swords, lie prone”?’ The revelling crew Rose from their cups: ‘He preaches abstinence: Behold, the man is mortified himself: The moonlight of his watchings and his fasts He carries on his face.’ When Princes forced Largess upon him, he replied, ‘I want Not yours but you;’ and with their gifts redeemed The orphan slave. The poor were as his children: He to the beggar stinted not his hand Nor, giving, said ‘Be brief.’ Such seed bare fruit: God in the dark, primeval woods had reared A race whose fierceness had its touch of ruth Brave, cordial, chaste, and simple. Reverence That race preserved: Reverence advanced to Love: The ties of life it honoured: lit from heaven They wore a meaning new. The Faith of Christ Banished the bestial from the heart of man; Restored the Hope divine. In all his toils Oswald with Aidan walked. Impartial law Not licence, not despotic favour, stands To Truth auxiliar true. Such laws were his: Yet not through such alone he worked for Truth; Function he claimed more high. When Aidan preached; In forest depths when thousands girt him round; When countless eyes, a clinging weight, were bent Upon his lips—all knew they spake from God,— The King, with monks from Ireland knit of old Beside the Bishop stood; each word he spake Changed to the Saxon tongue. Earth were not earth, If reign like Oswald's lasted. Penda lived; Nor e'er from Oswald turned for eight long years An eye like some swart planet feared of man, Omen of wars or plague. Cadwallon's fate, Ally ill-starred, that fought without his aid O'er-flushed old hatred with a fiery shame: Cadwallon nightly frowned above his dreams. The tyrant watched his time. At Maserfield The armies met. There on Northumbria's day Settled what seemed, yet was not, endless night; There Faith and Virtue, deathless seemed to die: There holy Oswald fell. For God he fought, Fought for his country. Walled with lances round, A sheaf of arrows quivering in his breast, One moment yet he stood. ‘Preserve,’ he cried, ‘My country, God!’ then added, gazing round, ‘And these my soldiers: make their spirits Thine!’ Thus perished good King Oswald, King and Saint; Saint by acclaim of nations canonised Ere yet the Church had spoken. Year by year The Hexham monks to Heaven-Field, where of old Had stood that ‘Cross which conquered,’ made repair, With chanted psalm; and pilgrims daily prayed Where died the just and true. Not vain their vows: In righteousness foundations had been laid: The earthquake reached them not. The Dane passed by; High up the Norman glittered: but beneath, On Faith profounder based and gentler Law The Saxon realm lived on. But never more From Heaven-Field's wreck the Briton raised his head; Britain thenceforth was England. His the right; The land was his of old; and in God's House His of the island races stood first-born: Not less he sinned through hate, esteeming more Memories of wrong than forward-looking hopes And triumphs of the Truth. For that cause God His face in blessing to the younger turned, More honouring Pagans who in ignorance erred Than those who, taught of God, concealed their gift Divorcing Faith from Love. Natheless they clung, That remnant spared, to rocky hills of Wales With eagle clutch, whoe'er in England ruled From Horsa's day to Edward's. Centuries eight In gorge or vale sea-lulled they held their own, By native monarchs swayed, while native harps Rang out from native cliffs defiant song Wild as their singing pines. Heroic Land! Freedom was thine; the torrent's plunge; the peak; The pale mist past it borne! Heroic Race! Caractacus was thine, and Galgacus, And Boadicea greater by her wrongs Than by her lineage. Battle-axe of thine Rand loud and long on Roman helms ere yet Hengist had trod the island. Thine that King World-famed, who led to fifty war-fields forth 'Gainst Saxon hosts his sinewy, long-haired race Unmailed, yet victory-crowned; that King who left Tintagel, Camelot, and Lyonnesse, Immortal names, though wild as elfin notes From phantom rocks echoed in fairy land— Great Arthur! Year by year his deeds were sung While he in Glastonbury's cloister slept, First by the race he died for, next by those Their children, exiles in Armoric Gaul, By Europe's minstrels then, from age to age; But ne'er by ampler voice, or richlier toned Than England lists to-day. Race once of Saints! Thine were they, Ninian thine and Kentigern, Iltud and Beino, yea and David's self, Thy crown of Saints, and Winifred, their flower Who fills her well with healing virtue still. Cadoc was thine, who to his Cambrian throne Preferred that western convent at Lismore, Yet taught the British Princes thus to sing: ‘None loveth Song that loves not Light and Truth: This is one of the poetic aphorisms of Cadoc, a Cambrian prince and saint, educated in the Irish monastery of Lismore, and afterwards the founder of the great Welsh monastery of Llancarvan, in which he gave religious instruction to the sons of the neighbouring princes and chiefs. None loveth Light and Truth that loves not Justice: None loveth Justice if he loves not God: None loveth God that lives not blest and great.’ CEADMON THE COWHERD, THE FIRST ENGLISH POET. Ceadmon, a cowherd, being at a feast, declares when the harp reaches him, that he cannot sing. As he sleeps, a divine Voice commands him to sing. He obeys, and the gift of song is imparted to him. Hilda, Abbess of Whitby, enrolls him among her monks; and in later years he sings the revolt of the Fallen Angels, and many Christian mysteries, thus becoming the first English poet. Alone upon the pleasant bank of Esk Ceadmon the Cowherd stood. The sinking sun Reddened the bay, and fired the river-bank, And flamed upon the ruddy herds that strayed Along the marge, clear-imaged. None was nigh: For that cause spake the Cowherd, ‘Praise to God! He made the worlds; and now, by Hilda's hand Planteth a crown on Whitby's holy crest: Daily her convent towers more high aspire: Daily ascend her Vespers. Hark that strain!’ He stood and listened. Soon the flame-touched herds Sent forth their lowings, and the cliffs replied, And Ceadmon thus resumed: ‘The music note Rings through their lowings dull, though heard by few! Poor kine, ye do your best! Ye know not God, Yet man, His likeness, unto you is God, And him ye worship with obedience sage, A grateful, sober, much-enduring race That o'er the vernal clover sigh for joy, With winter snows contend not. Patient kine, What thought is yours, deep-musing? Haply this, “God's help! how narrow are our thoughts, and few Not so the thoughts of that slight human child Who daily drives us with her blossomed rod From lowland valleys to the pails long-ranged!” Take comfort, kine! God also made your race! If praise from man surceased, from your broad chests That God would perfect praise, and, when ye died Resound it from yon rocks that gird the bay: God knoweth all things. Let that thought suffice!’ Thus spake the ruler of the deep-mouthed kine: They were not his; the man and they alike A neighbour's wealth. He was contented thus: Humble he was in station, meek of soul, Unlettered, yet heart-wise. His face was pale; Stately his frame, though slightly bent by age: Slow were his eyes, and slow his speech, and slow His musing step; and slow his hand to wrath; A massive hand, but soft, that many a time Had succoured man and woman, child and beast And yet could fiercely grasp the sword. At times As mightily it clutched his ashen goad When like an eagle on him swooped some thought: Then stood he as in dream, his pallid front Brightening like eastern sea-cliffs when a moon Unrisen is near its rising. Round the bay Meantime, as twilight deepened, many a fire Up-sprang, and horns were heard. Around the steep With bannered pomp and many a tossing plume Advancing slow a cavalcade made way. Oswy, Northumbria's king, the foremost rode, Oswy triumphant o'er the Mercian host, Invoking favour on his sceptre new; With him an Anglian prince, student long time In Bangor of the Irish, and a monk Of Frankish race far wandering from the Marne: They came to look on Hilda, hear her words Of far-famed wisdom on the Interior Life; For Hilda thus discoursed: ‘True life of man Is life within This thought is taken from one of St. Teresa's beautiful works.: inward immeasurably The being winds of all who walk the earth; But he whom sense hath blinded nothing knows Of that wide greatness: like a boy is he, A boy that clambers round some castle's wall In search of nests, the outward wall of seven, Yet nothing knows of those great courts within, The hall where princes banquet, or the bower Where royal maids discourse with lyre and lute, Much less its central church, and sacred shrine Wherein God dwells alone.’ Thus Hilda spake; And they that gazed upon her widening eyes Low whispered, each to each, ‘She speaks of things Which she hath seen and known.’ On Whitby's height The royal feast was holden: far below, A noisier revel dinned the shore; therein The humbler guests made banquet. Many a tent Gleamed on the yellow sands by ripples kissed; And many a savoury dish sent up its steam; The farmer from the field had brought his calf; Fishers that increase scaled which green-gulfed seas From womb crystalline, teeming, yield to man; And Jock, the woodsman, from his oaken glades The tall stag, arrow-pierced. In gay attire Now green, now crimson, matron sat and maid: Each had her due: the elder, reverence most, The lovelier that and love. Beside the board The beggar lacked not place. When hunger's rage, Sharpened by fresh sea-air, was quelled, the jest Succeeded, and the tale of foreign lands; Yet, boast who might of distant chief renowned, His battle-axe, or fist that felled an ox, The Anglian's answer was ‘our Hilda’ still: ‘Is not her prayer trenchant as sworded hosts? Her insight more than wisdom of the seers? What birth like hers illustrious? Edwin's self, Dëira's exile, next Northumbria's king, Her kinsman was. Together bowed they not When he of holy hand, missioned from Rome, Paulinus, o'er them poured the absolving wave And joined to Christ? Kingliest was she, that maid Who spurned earth-crowns!’ More late the miller rose— He ruled the feast, the miller old, yet blithe— And cried, ‘A song!’ So song succeeded song, For each man knew that time to chant his stave, But no man yet sang nobly. Last the harp Made way to Ceadmon, lowest at the board: He pushed it back, answering, ‘I cannot sing:’ The rest around him flocked with clamour, ‘Sing!’ And one among them, voluble and small, Shot out a splenetic speech: ‘This lord of kine, Our herdsman, grows to ox! Behold, his eyes Move slow, like eyes of oxen!’ Slowly rose Ceadmon, and spake: ‘I note full oft young men Quick-eyed, but small-eyed, darting glances round Now here, now there, like glance of some poor bird, That light on all things and can rest on none: As ready are they with their tongues as eyes; But all their songs are chirpings backward blown On winds that sing God's song by them unheard: My oxen wait my service: I depart.’ Then strode he to his cow-house in the mead, Displeased though meek, and muttered, ‘Slow of eye! My kine are slow: if rapid I, my hand Might tend them worse.’ Hearing his step, the kine Turned round their hornèd fronts; and angry thoughts Went from him as a vapour. Straw he brought, And strewed their beds; and they, contented well Laid down ere long their great bulks, breathing deep Amid the glimmering moonlight. He, with head Propped on a favourite heifer's snowy flank, Rested, his deer-skin o'er him drawn. Hard days Bring slumber soon. His latest thought was this: ‘Though witless things we are, my kine and I, Yet God it was who made us.’ As he slept Beside him stood a Man Divine, and spake: ‘Ceadmon, arise, and sing.’ Ceadmon replied, ‘My Lord, I cannot sing, and for that cause Forth from the revel came I. Once, in youth, I willed to sing the bright face of a maid, And failed, and once a gold-faced harvest-field, And failed, and once the flame-eyed face of war, And failed again.’ To him the Man Divine, ‘Those themes were earthly. Sing!’ And Ceadmon said, ‘What shall I sing, my Lord?’ Then answer came, ‘Ceadmon, stand up, and sing thy song of God.’ At once obedient, Ceadmon rose, and sang; And help was with him from great thoughts of old Yearly within his silent nature stored, That swelled, collecting like a flood which bursts In spring its icy bar. The Lord of all He sang; that God beneath whose hand eterne, Then when He willed forth-stretched athwart the abyss, Creation like a fiery chariot ran, Forth-borne on wheels of ever-living stars: Him first he sang. The builder, here below, From fair foundations rears at last the roof; But Song, a child of heaven, begins with heaven, The archetype divine, and end of all; More late descends to earth. He sang that hymn ‘Let there be light, and there was light;’ and lo! On the void deep came down the seal of God And stamped immortal form. Clear laughed the skies; From circumambient deeps the strong earth brake, Both continent and isle; while downward rolled The sea-surge summoned to his home remote. Then came a second vision to the man There standing 'mid his oxen. Darkness sweet, He sang, of pleasant frondage clothed the vales, And purple glooms ambrosial cast from hills Now by the sun deserted, which the moon, A glory new-created in her place, Silvered with virgin beam, while sang the bird Her first of love-songs on the branch first-flower'd— Not yet the lion stalked. And Ceadmon sang O'er-awed, the Father of all humankind Standing in garden planted by God's hand, And girt by murmurs of the rivers four, Between the trees of Knowledge and of Life, With eastward face. In worship mute of God Eden's Contemplative he stood that hour, Not her Ascetic, since, where sin is none, No need for spirit severe. And Ceadmon sang God's Daughter, Adam's Sister, Child, and Bride, Our Mother Eve. Lit by the matin star That nearer drew to earth and brighter flashed To meet her gaze, that snowy Innocence Stood up with queenly port: she turned; she saw Earth's King, mankind's great Father: taught by God, Immaculate, unastonished, undismayed, In love and reverence to her Lord she drew And, kneeling, kissed his hand: and Adam laid That hand, made holier, on that kneeler's head, And spake; ‘For this shall man his parents leave And to his wife cleave fast.’ When Ceadmon ceased Thus spake the Man Divine: ‘At break of day Seek out some prudent man, and say that God Hath loosed thy tongue; nor hide henceforth thy gift.’ Then Ceadmon turned, and slept among his kine Dreamless. Ere dawn he stood upon the shore In doubt: but when at last o'er eastern seas The sun, long wished for, like a god upsprang Once more he found God's song upon his mouth Murmuring high joy; and sought an ancient friend, And told him all the vision. At the word He to the Abbess with the tidings sped, And she made answer, ‘Bring me Ceadmon here.’ Then clomb the pair that sea-beat mount of God Fanned by sea-gale nor trod, as others used, The curving way, but faced the abrupt ascent And halted not, so worked in both her will, Till now between the unfinished towers they stood Panting and spent. The portals open stood: Ceadmon passed in alone. Nor ivory decked, Nor gold, the walls. That convent was a keep Strong 'gainst invading storm or demon hosts, And naked as the rock whereon it stood, Yet, as a church, august. Dark, high-arched roofs Slowly let go the distant hymn. Each cell Cinctured its statued saint, the peace of God On every stony face. Like caverned grot Far off the western window frowned: beyond, Close by, there shook an autumn-blazoned tree: No need for gems beside of storied glass. He entered last that hall where Hilda sat Begirt with a great company, the chiefs Far ranged from end to end. Three stalls crosscrowned Stood side by side, the midmost hers. The years Had laid upon her brows a hand serene: There left alone a blessing. Levelled eyes Sable, and keen, with meditative might Conjoined the instinct and the claim to rule: Firm were her lips and rigid. At her right Sat Finan, Aidan's successor, with head Snow-white, and beard that rolled adown a breast Never by mortal passion heaved in storm, A cloister of majestic thoughts that walked Humbly with God. High in the left-hand stall Oswy was throned, a man in prime, with brow Less youthful than his years. Exile long past, Or deepening thought of one disastrous deed, Had left a shadow in his eyes. The strength Of passion held in check looked lordly forth From head and hand: tawny his beard; his hair Thick-curled and dense. Alert the monarch sat Half turned, like one on horseback set that hears, And he alone, the advancing trump of war. Down the long gallery strangers thronged in mass, Dane or Norwegian, huge of arm through weight Of billows oar-subdued, with stormy looks Wild as their waves and crags; Southerns keen-browed; Pure Saxon youths, fair-fronted, with mild eyes, These less than others strove for nobler place, And Pilgrim travel-worn. Behind the rest And higher-ranged in marble-arched arcade, Sat Hilda's sisterhood. Clustering they shone, White-veiled, and pale of face, and still and meek, An inly-bending curve, like some young moon Whose crescent glitters o'er a dusky strait. In front were monks dark-stoled: for Hilda ruled Though feminine, two houses, one of men: Upon two chasm-divided rocks they stood, To various service vowed though single Faith: Not ever, save at rarest festival, Their holy inmates met. ‘Is this the man Favoured, though late, with gift of song?’ thus spake Hilda with gracious smile. Severer then She added: ‘Son, the commonest gifts of God He counts His best, and oft temptation blends With ampler boon. Yet sing! That God who lifts The violet from the grass could draw not less Song from the stone hard by. That strain thou sang'st, Once more rehearse it.’ Ceadmon from his knees Arose and stood. With princely instinct first The strong man to the Abbess bowed, and next To that great twain the bishop and the king Last to that stately concourse each side ranged Down the long hall; then, dubious, answered thus: ‘Great Mother, if that God who sent the song Vouchsafe me to recall it, I will sing; But I misdoubt it lost.’ Slowly his face Down-drooped, and all his body forward bent While brooding memory, step by step, retraced Its backward way. Vainly long time it sought The starting-point. Then Ceadmon's large, soft hands Opening and closing worked; for wont were they, In musings when he stood, to clasp his goad, And plant its point far from him, thereupon Propping his stalwart weight. Customed support Now finding not, unwittingly those hands Reached forth, and on Saint Finan's crosier-staff Settling, withdrew it from the old bishop's grasp; And Ceadmon leant thereon, while passed a smile From chief to chief to see earth's meekest man The spiritual sceptre claim of Lindisfarne. They smiled; he triumphed: soon the Cowherd found That first fair corner-stone of all his song; Thence rose the fabric heavenward. Lifting hands, Once more his lordly music he rehearsed, The void abyss at God's command forth-flinging Creation like a Thought: where night had reigned, The universe of God. The singing stars Which with the Angels sang when earth was made Sang in his song. From highest shrill of lark To ocean's moaning under cliffs low-browed, And roar of pine-woods on the storm-swept hills, No tone was wanting; while to them that heard Strange images looked forth of worlds new-born, Fair, phantom mountains, and, with forests plumed Heaven-topping headlands, for the first time glassed In waters ever calm. O'er sapphire seas Green islands laughed. Fairer, the wide earth's flower Eden, on airs unshaken yet by sighs From bosom still inviolate forth poured Immortal sweets that sense to spirit turned In part those noble listeners made that song! Their flashing eyes, their hands, their heaving breasts, Tumult self-stilled, and mute, expectant trance, 'Twas these that gave their bard his twofold might— That might denied to poets later born Who, singing to soft brains and hearts ice-hard, Applauded or contemned, alike roll round A vainly-seeking eye, and, famished, drop A hand clay-cold upon the unechoing shell Missing their inspiration's human half. Thus Ceadmon sang, and ceased. Silent awhile The concourse stood, for all had risen, as though Waiting from heaven its echo. Each on each Gazed hard and caught his hands. Fiercely ere long Their gratulating shout aloft had leaped But Hilda laid her finger on her lip Or provident lest praise might stain the pure, Or deeming song a gift too high for praise. She spake: ‘Through help of God thy song is sound: Now hear His Holy Word, and shape therefrom A second hymn, and worthier than the first.’ She spake, and Finan standing bent his head Above the sacred tome in reverence stayed Upon his kneeling deacon's hands and brow, And sweetly sang five verses, thus beginning, ‘Cum esset desponsata,’ and was still And next rehearsed them in the Anglian tongue: Then Ceadmon took God's Word into his heart And ruminating stood, as when the kine Their flowery pasture ended, ruminate; And was a man in thought. At last the light Shone from his dubious countenance and he spake: ‘Great Mother, lo! I saw a second Song! T'wards me it sailed; but with averted face And borne on shifting winds. A man am I Sluggish and slow that needs must muse and brood; Therefore those verses till the sun goes down Will I revolve. If song from God be mine Expect me here at morn.’ The morrow morn In that high presence Ceadmon stood and sang A second song, and worthier than his first; And Hilda said, ‘From God it came, not man; Thou therefore live a monk among my monks, And sing to God.’ Doubtful he stood—‘From youth My place hath been with kine; their ways I know, And how to cure their griefs.’ Smiling she spake, ‘Our convent hath its meads, and kine; with these Consort each morn: at noon to us return.’ Then Ceadmon knelt, and bowed, and said, ‘So be it:’ And aged Finan, and Northumbria's king Oswy, approved; and all that host had joy. Thus in that convent Ceadmon lived, a monk, Humblest of all the monks, save him that knelt In cell close by, who once had been a prince. Seven times a day he sang God's praises, first When earliest dawn drew back night's sable veil With trembling hand, revisiting the earth Like some pale maid that through the curtain peers Round her sick mother's bed, misdoubting half If sleep lie there, or death; latest when eve Through nave and chancel stole from arch to arch, And laid upon the snowy altar-step At last a brow all gold. In later years By ancient yearnings driven through wood and vale He tracked Dëirean or Bernician glades To holy Ripon, or late-sceptred York, Not yet great Wilfred's seat, or Beverley: The children gathered round him, crying, ‘Sing!’ They gave him inspiration with their eyes, And with his conquering music he returned it. Oftener he roamed that strenuous eastern coast To Jarrow and to Wearmouth, sacred sites The well-beloved of Bede, or northward more To Bamborough, Oswald's keep. At Coldingham His feet had rest; there where St. Ebba's Cape That ends the lonely range of Lammermoor, Sustained for centuries o'er the wild sea-surge In region of dim mist and flying bird, Fronting the Forth, those convent piles far-kenned The worn-out sailor's hope. Fair English shores, Despite those blinding storms of north and east, Despite rough ages blind with stormier strife, Or froz'n by doubt, or sad with worldly care, A fragrance as of Carmel haunts you still Bequeathed by feet of that forgotten Saint Who trod you once sowing the seed divine! Fierce tribes that kenned him distant round him flocked; On sobbing sands the fisher left his net His lamb the shepherd on the hills of March Suing for song. With wrinkled face all smiles, Like that blind Scian circling Grecian coasts If God the song accorded, Ceadmon sang; If God denied it, after musings deep He answered, ‘I am of the kine and dumb;’ The man revered his art and fraudful song Esteemed as fraudful coin. Music denied, He solaced them with tales wherein, so seemed it, Nature and Grace, inwoven, like children played Or like two sisters o'er one sampler bent, Braided one text. Ever the sorrowful chance Ending in joy, the human craving still, Like creeper circling up the Tree of Life, Lifted by hand unseen, witnessed that He, Man's Maker, is the Healer too of man, And life His school parental. Parables He shewed in all things. ‘Mark,’ one day he cried, ‘Yon silver-breasted swan that stems the lake Taking nor chill nor moisture! Such the soul That floats o'er waters of a world corrupt, Itself immaculate still.’ Better than tale They loved their minstrel's harp. The songs he sang Were songs to brighten gentle hearts; to fire Strong hearts with holier courage; hope to breathe Through spirits despondent, o'er the childless floor Or widowed bed, flashing from highest heaven A beam half faith, half vision. Many a tear, His own, and tears of those that listened, fell Oft as he sang that hand, lovely as light, Forth stretched, and gathering from forbidden boughs That fruit fatal to man. He sang the Flood Sin's doom that quelled the impure, yet raised to height Else inaccessible, the just. He sang That patriarch facing at divine command The illimitable waste—then, harder proof, Lifting his knife o'er him, the Seed foretold: He sang of Israel loosed, the ten black seals Down pressed on Egypt's testament of woe, Covenant of pride with penance; sang the face Of Moses glittering from red Sinai's rocks, The Tables twain and Mandements of God. On Christian nights he sang that jubilant star Which led the Magians to the Bethlehem crib By Joseph watched, and Mary. Pale, in Lent, Tremulous and pale, he told of Calvary, Nor added word, but, as in trance rehearsed That Passion fourfold of the Evangelists Which, terrible and swift—not like a tale— With speed of things which must be done, not said, A river of bale from guilty age to age Along the astonied shores of common life Annual makes way, the history of the world, Not of one day, one People. To its fount That stream he tracked, that primal mystery sang Which, chanted later by a thousand years Music celestial, though with note that jarred, Some wandering orb troubling its starry chime, Amazed the nations, ‘There was war in heaven: Michael and they, his angels warfare waged With Satan and his angels.’ Brief that war, That ruin total. Brief was Ceadmon's song: Therein the Eternal Face was undivulged: Therein the Apostate's form no grandeur wore: The grandeur was elsewhere. Who hate their God Change not alone to vanquished but to vile. On Easter morn he sang the Saviour Risen, Eden Regained. Since then on England's shores Though many sang, yet no man sang like him. O holy House of Whitby! on thy steep Rejoice howe'er the tempest night or day Afflict thee, or the hand of Time to earth Drag down thine airy arches long suspense; Rejoice, for Ceadmon in thy cloisters knelt, And singing paced beside thy sounding sea! Long years he lived; and with the whitening hair More youthful grew in spirit and more meek; Yea, those that saw him said he sang within Then when the golden mouth but seldom breathed Sonorous strain, and when—that fulgent eye No longer bright—still on his forehead shone Not flame but purer light like that last beam Which, when the sunset woods no longer burn Maintains high place on Alpine throne remote, Or utmost beak of promontoried cloud And heavenward dies in smiles. Esteem of men Daily he less esteemed, through single heart More knit with God. To please a sickly child He sang his latest song, and, ending, said, ‘Song is but body, though 'tis body winged: The soul of song is love: the body dead, The soul should thrive the more.’ That Patmian Sage Whose head had lain upon the Saviour's breast, Who in high vision saw the First and Last, Who heard the harpings of the Elders crowned, Who o'er the ruins of the Imperial House And ashes of the twelve great Cæsars dead Witnessed the endless triumph of the Just, To humbler life restored, and, weak through age, But seldom spake, and gave but one command, The great ‘Mandatum Novum’ of his Lord, ‘My children, love each other!’ Like to his Was Ceadmon's age. Weakness with happy stealth Increased upon him: he was cheerful still: He still could pace, though slowly, in the sun, Still gladsomely converse with friends who wept, Still lay a broad hand on his well-loved kine. The legend of the last of Ceadmon's days:— That hospital wherein the old monks died Stood but a stone's throw from the monastery: ‘Make there my couch to-night,’ he said, and smiled: They marvelled, yet obeyed. There, hour by hour, The man, low-seated on his pallet bed, In silence watched the courses of the stars, Or casual spake at times of common things, And three times played with childhood's days, and twice His father named. At last, like one that, long Compassed with good, is smit by sudden thought Of greater good, thus spake he: ‘Have ye, sons, Here in this house the Blessed Sacrament?’ They answered, wrathful, ‘Father, thou art strong; Shake not thy children! Thou hast many days!’ ‘Yet bring me here the Blessed Sacrament,’ Once more he said. The brethren issued forth Save four that silent sat waiting the close. Ere long in grave procession they returned, Two deacons first, gold-vested; after these That priest who bare the Blessed Sacrament, And acolytes behind him lifting lights. Then from his pallet Ceadmon slowly rose And worshipped Christ, his God, and reaching forth His right hand, cradled in his left, behold! Therein was laid God's Mystery. He spake: ‘Stand ye in flawless charity of God T'ward me, my sons; or lives there in your hearts Memory the least of wrong?’ The monks replied: ‘Father, within us lives nor wrong, nor wrath, But love, and love alone.’ And he: ‘Not less Am I in charity with you, my sons, And all my sins of pride, and other sins, Humbly I mourn.’ Then bending the old head O'er the old hand, Ceadmon received his Lord To be his soul's viaticum, in might Leading from life that seems to life that is; And long, unpropped by any, kneeling hung And made thanksgiving prayer. Thanksgiving made, He sat upon his bed, and spake: ‘How long Ere yet the monks begin their matin psalms?’ ‘That hour is nigh,’ they answered; he replied, ‘Then let us wait that hour,’ and laid him down With those kine-tending and harp-mastering hands Crossed on his breast, and slept. Meanwhile the monks, The lights removed in reverence of his sleep, Sat mute nor stirred such time as in the Mass Between ‘Orate Fratres’ glides away, And ‘Hoc est Corpus Meum.’ Northward far The great deep, seldom heard so distant, roared Round those wild rocks half way to Bamborough Head; For now the mightiest spring-tide of the year Following the magic of a maiden moon Approached its height. Nearer, that sea which sobbed In many a cave by Whitby's winding coast Or died in peace on many a sandy bar From river-mouth to river-mouth outspread, They heard, and mused upon eternity That circles human life. Gradual arose A softer strain and sweeter making way O'er that sea-murmur hoarse; and they were ware That in the black far-shadowing church whose bulk Up-towered between them and the moon, the monks Their matins had begun. A little sigh That moment reached them from the central gloom Guarding the sleeper's bed; a second sigh Succeeded: neither seemed the sigh of pain: And some one said, ‘He wakens.’ Large and bright Over the church-roof sudden rushed the moon And smote the cross above that sleeper's couch, And smote that sleeper's face. The smile thereon Was calmer than the smile of life. Thus died Ceadmon, the earliest bard of English song. ‘A part of one of Ceadmon's poems is preserved in King Alfred's Saxon version of Bede's History.’ (Note to Bede's Ecclesiastical History, edited by Dr. Giles, p. 218.) KING OSWY OF NORTHUMBRIA, OR THE WIFE'S VICTORY. Oswy, King of Bernicia, being at war with his kinsman Oswin, slays him unarmed. He refuses to repent of this sin; yet at last, subdued by the penitence, humility, and charity of Eanfleda, his wife, repents likewise, and builds a monastery over the grave of Oswin. Afterwards he becomes a great warrior and dies a saint. Young, beauteous, brave—the bravest of the brave— Who loved not Oswin? All that saw him loved: Aidan loved most, monk of Iona's Isle, Northumbria's bishop next from Lindisfarne Ruling in things divine. One morn it chanced That Oswin, noting how with staff in hand Old Aidan roamed his spiritual realm, footbare, Wading deep stream and piercing thorny brake, Sent him a horse, his best. The Saint was pleased; But, onward while he rode, and, musing, smiled To think of these his honours in old age, A beggar claimed his alms. ‘Gold have I none,’ Aidan replied; ‘this horse be thine!’ The King, Hearing the tale, was grieved. ‘Keep I, my lord, No meaner horses fit for beggar's use That thus my best should seem a thing of naught?’ The Saint made answer: ‘Beggar's use, my King! What was that horse? The foal of some poor mare! The least of men—the sinner—is God's child!’ Then dropped the King on both his knees, and cried: ‘Father, forgive me!’ As they sat at meat Oswin was mirthful, and at jest and tale His hungry thanes laughed loud. But great, slow tears In silence trickled down old Aidan's face: These all men marked; yet no man question made. At last to one beside him Aidan spake In Erin's tongue unknown to all save them ‘God will not leave such meekness long on earth.’ Who loved not Oswin? Not alone his realm, Dëira, loved him, but Bernician lords Whose monarch, Oswy, was a man of storms, Fierce King albeit in youth baptized to Christ; At heart half pagan. Swift as northern cloud Through summer skies he swept with all his host Down on the rival kingdom. Face to face The armies stood. But Oswin, when he marked His own a little flock 'mid countless wolves, Addressed them thus: ‘Why perish, friends, for me? From exile came I: for my people's sake To exile I return, or gladlier die: Depart in peace.’ He rode to Gilling Tower; And waited there his fate. Thither next day King Oswy marched, and slew him. Twelve days passed; Then Aidan, while through green Northumbria's woods Pensive he paced, steadying his doubtful steps, Felt death approaching. Giving thanks to God, The old man laid him by a church half raised Amid great oaks and yews, and leaning there His head against the buttress passed to God. They made their bishop's grave at Lindisfarne; But Oswin rested at the mouth of Tyne Within a wave-girt, granite promontory Where sea and river meet. For many an age The pilgrim from far countries came in faith To that still shrine—they called it ‘Oswin's Peace,’— Thither the outcast fled for sanctuary: The sick man there found health. Thus Oswin lived Though dead, a benediction in the land. What tenderest form kneels on the rain-washed ground From Gilling's keep a stone's-throw? Whose those hands Now pressed in anguish on a bursting heart Now o'er a tearful countenance spread in shame? What purest mouth, but roseless for great woe, With zeal to youthful lovers never known Presses a new-made grave, and through the blades Of grass wind-shaken breathes her piteous prayer? Save from remorse came ever grief like hers? Yet how could ever sin, or sin's remorse, Find such fair mansion? Oswin's grave it is; And she that o'er it kneels is Eanfleda Kinswoman of the noble dead, and wife To Oswin's murderer, Oswy. Saddest one And sweetest! Lo, that cloud which overhung Her cradle swathes once more in deeper gloom Her throne late won, and new-decked bridal bed. This was King Edwin's babe, whose natal star Shone on her father's pathway doubtful long Shone there a line of light, from pagan snares Leading to Christian baptism. Penda heard— Penda, that drew his stock from Odin's stock, Penda, that drank his wine from skulls of foes, Penda, fierce Mercia's king. He heard, and fell In ruin on the region. Edwin dead, Paulinus led the widow and her babe Back to that Kentish shore whereon had reigned Its grandsire Ethelbert. The infant's feet Pattered above the pavement of that church In Canterbury by Augustine raised; The child grew paler when Gregorian chants Shook the dim roofs. Gladly the growing girl Hearkened to stories of her ancestress Clotilda, boast of France, but weeping turned From legends whispered by her Saxon nurse Of Loke, the Spirit accursed that slanders gods, And Sinna, Queen of Hell. The years went by; The last had brought King Oswy's embassage With suit obsequious, ‘Let the princess share With me her father's crown.’ To simple hearts Changes come gently. Soon, all trust, she stood Before God's altar with her destined lord: Adown her finger while the bride-ring ran So slid into her heart a true wife's love: Rooted in faith, it ripened day by day; And now the end was this! There as she knelt A strong foot clanged behind her. ‘Weeping still! Up, wife of mine! If Oswin had not died His gracious ways had filched from me my realm, The base so loved his meekness!’ Turning not She answered low: ‘He died an unarmed man:’ And Oswy: ‘Fool that fought not when he might; At least his slaughtered troop had decked his grave! I scorned him for his grief that men should die; And, scorning him, I hated; yea, for that His blood is on my sword!’ The priests of God Had faced the monarch and denounced his crime: They might as well have preached to ocean waves: He felt no anger: he but deemed them mad And smiling went his way. Thus autumn passed: The queen, he knew it, when alone wept on; Near him the pale face smiled; the voice was sweet; Loving the service; the obedience full: Neither by words, by silence, nor by looks She chid him. Like some penitent she walked That mourns her own great sin. Yet Oswy's heart, Remorseless thus, had moods of passionate love: A warrior of his host, Tosti by name, Lay low, plague-stricken: kith and kin had fled; Whole days the king sustained upon his knees The sufferer's head, and cheered his heart with songs Of Odin, strangely blent with Christian hymns While ofttimes stormy bursts of tears descended Upon that face upturned. Ministering he sat Till death the vigil closed. One winter night From distant chase belated he returned, And passed by Oswin's grave. The snow, new-fallen, Whitened the precinct. In the blast she knelt, While coldly glared the broad and bitter moon Upon those flying flakes that on her hair Settled, or on her thin light raiment clung. She heard him not draw nigh. She only beat Her breast, and, praying, wept: ‘Our sin, our sin!’ There as the monarch stood a change came o'er him: Old, exiled days in Alba as a dream Redawned upon his spirit, and that look In Aidan's eyes when, binding first that cross Long by his pupil craved around his neck He whispered: ‘He who serveth Christ, his Lord, Must love his fellow-man.’ As when a stream The ice dissolved, grows audible once more So came to him those words. They dragged him down: He knelt beside his wife, and beat his breast, And said, ‘My sin, my sin!’ Till earliest morn Glimmered through sleet that twain wept on, prayed on: Was it the rising sun that lit at last The fair face upward lifted;—kindled there A lovelier dawn than o'er it blushed when first Dropped on her bridegroom's breast? Aloud she cried: ‘Our prayer is heard: our penitence finds grace:’ Then added: ‘Let it deepen till we die! A monastery build we on this grave: So from this grave while fleet the years, that prayer Shall rise both day and night, till Christ returns To judge the world, a prayer for him who died, A prayer for one who sinned, but sins no more.’ Where Gilling's long and lofty hill o'erlooks For leagues the forest-girdled plain, ere long A monastery stood. That self-same day In tears the penitential work began; In tears the sod was turned. The rugged brows Of March relaxed 'neath April's flying kiss: Again the violet rose, the thrush was loud; Mayday had come. Around that hallowed spot Full many a warrior met; some Christians vowed; Some muttering low of Odin. Near to these Stood one of lesser stature, keener eye, More fiery gesture. Splenetic, he marked, Christian albeit himself, those Christian walls By Saxon converts raised:—he was a Briton. Invisibly that morn a dusky crape O'erstretched the sky; and slowly swayed the bough Heavy with midnight rains. Through mist the woods Let out the witchery of their young fresh green Backed by the dusk of ruddy oaks that still Reserved at heart the old year's stubbornness, Yet blent it with that purple distance glimpsed Beyond the forest alleys. In a tent Finan sang Mass: his altar was that stone Which told where Oswin died. Before it knelt The king, the queen: alone their angels know Their thoughts that hour! The sacred rite complete, They raised their brows, and, hand-in-hand, made way To where, beyond the portal, shone blue skies Nature's long-struggling smile at last divulged. The throng—with passion it had prayed for each— Divided as they passed. In either face They saw the light of that conceded prayer, The peace of souls forgiven. From that day forth Hourly in Oswy's spirit soared more high The one true greatness. Flaming heats of soul, Through faith subjected to a law divine, Like fire, man's vassal, mastering iron ore Learned their true work. The immeasurable strength Had found at once its master and its end, And, balanced thus while weighted, soared to God. In all his ways he prospered, work and work Yoked to one end. Till then the Kingdoms Seven, Opposed in interests as diverse in name Had looked on nothing like him. Now, despite Mercia that frowned, they named him king of kings, Bretwalda; and the standard of the Seven In peace foreran his feet. The Spirits of might Before his vanguard winged their way in war, Scattering the foe; and in his peacefuller years Upon the aerial hillside high and higher The golden harvest clomb, waving delight On eyes upraised from winding rivers clear That shone with milky sails. His feet stood firm, For with his growing greatness ever grew His penitence. Still sang the cloistered choir, Year after year pleading o'er Oswin's tomb, ‘To him who perished grant thy Vision, Lord; To him the slayer, penitence and peace; Let Oswin pray for Oswy:’ Oswin prayed. What answered Penda when the tidings came Of Oswy glorying in the yoke of Christ, Of Oswy's victories next? Grinding his teeth, He spake what no man heard. Then rumour rose Of demon-magic making Oswy's tongue Fell as his sword. ‘Within the sorcerer's court,’ It babbled, ‘stood the brave East Saxon king: Upon his shoulder Oswy laid a hand Accursed and whispered in his ear. The king, Down sank, perforce, a Christian!’ Lightning flashed From under Penda's grey and shaggy brows; ‘Forth to Northumbria, son,’ he cried, ‘and back; And learn if this be true.’ That son obeyed, Peada, to whose heart another's heart, Alcfrid's, King Oswy's son, was knit long since As David's unto Jonathan's. One time A tenderer heart had leaned, or seemed to lean, Motioning that way, Alfleda's Alcfrid's sister, Younger than he six years. 'Twas so no more: No longer on Peada's eyes her eyes Rested well-pleased: not now the fearless hand Tarried in his contented. ‘Sir and king,’ Peada thus to Oswy spake, ‘of old Thy child, then child indeed, would mount my knee; Now, when I seek her, like a swan she fleets That arches back its neck 'twixt snowy wings And, swerving, sideway drifts. My lord and king, The child is maiden: give her me for wife!’ Oswy made answer: ‘He that serves not Christ Can wed no child of mine.’ Alfleda then Dropping her broidery lifted on her sire Gently the dewy light of childlike eyes And spake, ‘But he in time will worship Christ!’ Then, without blush or tremor, to her work Softly returned. Silent her mother smiled. That moment, warned of God, from Lindisfarne Finan, unlooked for, entered. Week by week Reverend and mild he preached the Saviour-Lord: Grave-eyed, with listening face and forehead bowed The prince gave ear, not like that trivial race Who catch the sense ere spoken, smile assent, And in a moment lose it. On his brow At times the apprehension dawned, at times Faded. Oft turned he to his Mercian lords: ‘How trow ye, friends? He speaks of what he knows! Good tidings these! Each evening while I muse Distinct they shine like yonder mountain range; Each morning, mists conceal them.’ Passed a month; Then suddenly, as one that wakes from dream, Peada rose: ‘Far rather would I serve Thy Christ,’ he said, ‘and thus Alfleda lose, Than win Alfleda, and reject thy Christ.’ He spake: old Finan first gave thanks to God, Who grants the true heart valour to believe, Then took his hand and led him to that Cross On Heaven-Field raised beneath the Roman Wall, That Cross King Oswald's standard in the fight, That Cross Cadwallon's sentence as he fell, ‘That Cross which conquered;’—there to God baptized; Likewise his thanes and earls. Meantime, far off In Penda's palace-keep the revel raged, High feast of rites impure. At banquet sat The monarch and his chiefs; chant followed chant Bleeding with wars foregone. The day went by, And, setting ere its time, a sanguine sun Dipped into tumult vast of gathering storm That soon incumbent leant from tower to tower And shook them to their base. As high within The gladness mounted, meeting storm with storm, Till cried that sacrificial priest whose knife Had pierced the warrior victim's willing throat That morn, ‘Already with the gods we feast! Hark! round Valhalla swell the phantom wars!’ Ere ceased the shout applausive, from his seat Uprose the warrior Saxo, in his hand The goblet, in the other Alp, his sword, Pointing to heaven. ‘To Odin health!’ he cried; ‘Would that this hour he rode into this hall! He should not hence depart till blood of his Had reddened Sleipner's flank, his snow-white steed: This sword would shed that blood!’ Warriors sixteen Leaped up in wrath, and for a moment rage Rocked the huge hall. But Saxo waved his sword, And, laughing, shouted, ‘Odin's sons, be still! Count it no sin to battle with high gods! Great-hearted they! They give the blow and take! To Odin who was ever leal as I?’ As sudden as it rose the tumult fell: So ceased the storm without: but with it ceased The rapture and the madness, and the shout: The wine-cup still made circuit; but the song Froze in mid-air. Strange shadow hung o'er all: Neighbour to neighbour whispered: courtiers slid Through doors scarce open. Rumour had arrived, If true or false none knew. The morrow morn From Penda's court the bravest fled in fear, Questioning with white lips, ‘Will he slay his son?’ Or skulked at distance. Penda by the throat Catching a white-cheeked courtier, cried: ‘The truth! What whisper they in corners?’ On his knees That courtier made confession. Penda then, ‘Live, since my son is yet a living man! A Christian, say'st thou? Let him serve his Christ! That man whom ever most I scorned is he Who vows him to the service of some god, Yet breaks his laws; for that man walks, a lie. My son shall live, and after me shall reign: Northumbria's realm shall die!’ Thus Penda spake And sent command from tower and town to blow Instant the trumpet of his last of wars, Fanning from Odin's hall with airs ice-cold Of doom the foes of Odin. ‘Man nor child,’ He sware, ‘henceforth shall tread Northumbrian soil, Nor hart nor hind: I spare the creeping worm: My scavenger is he.’ The Mercian realm Rose at his call, innumerable mass Of warriors iron-armed. East Anglia sent Her hosts in aid. Apostate Ethelwald, Through Oswy's nephew, joined the hostile league, And thirty chiefs besides that ruled by right Princedom or province. Mightier far than these Old Cambria, brooding o'er ancestral wrong, The Saxon's sin original, met his call, And vowed her to the vengeance. Bravest hearts Hate most the needless slaughter. Oswy mused: ‘Long since too much of blood is on this hand: Shall I for pride or passion risk once more Northumbria, my mother;—rudely stain Her pretty babes with blood?’ To Penda then, Camped on the confines of the adverse realms, He sent an embassage of reverend men, Warriors and priests. Before them, staff in hand, Peaceful, with hoary brows and measured tread, Twelve heralds paced. Twelve caskets bare they heaped With gems and gold, and thus addressed the King: ‘Lord of the Mercian realm, renowned in arms! Our lord, Northumbria's monarch, bids thee hail: He never yet in little thing or great Hath wronged thy kingdom; yet thy peace he woos: Accept the gifts he sends thee, and, thus crowned, Depart content.’ Penda with backward hand Waved them far from him, and vouchsafed no word. In sadness they returned: but Oswy smiled Hearing their tale, and said: ‘My part is done: Let God decide the event.’ He spake, and took The caskets twelve, and placed them, side by side, Before the altar of his chiefest church And vowed to raise to God twelve monasteries, In honour of our Lord's Apostles Twelve, On greenest upland, or in sylvan glade Where purest stream kisses the richest mead. His vow recorded, sudden through the church Ran with fleet foot a lady mazed with joy, Crying, ‘A maiden babe! and lo, the queen Late dying lives and thrives!’ That eve the king Bestowed on God the new-born maiden babe, Laying her cradled 'mid those caskets twelve, Six at each side; and said: ‘For her nor throne Nor marriage bower! She in some holy house Shall dwell the Bride of Christ. But thou, just God, This day avenge my people!’ Windwaed field Heard, distant still, that multitudinous foe Trampling the darksome ways. With pallid face Morning beheld their standards, raven-black— Penda had thus decreed, before him sending Northumbria's sentence. On a hill, thick-set Stood Oswy's army, small, yet strong in faith, A wedge-like phalanx, fenced by rocks and woods; A river in its front. His standards white Sustained the Mother Maid and Babe Divine: From many a crag his altars rose, choir-girt And crowned by incense wreath. An hour ere noon, That river passed, in thunder met the hosts; But Penda, straitened by that hilly tract, Could wield not half his force. Sequent as waves On rushed they: Oswy's phalanx like a cliff Successively down dashed them. Day went by: At last the clouds dispersed: the westering sun Glared on the spent eyes of those Mercian ranks Which in their blindness each the other smote, Or, trapped by hidden pitfalls, fell on stakes And died blaspheming. Little help that day Gat they from Cambria. She on Heaven-Field height Had felt her death-wound, slow albeit to die. The apostate Ethelwald in panic fled: The East Anglians followed. Swollen by recent rains, And choked with dead, the river burst its bound, And raced along the devastated plain Till cry of drowning horse and shriek of man Rang far and farther o'er that sea of death, A battle-field but late. This way and that Briton or Mercian where he might escaped Through flood or forest. Penda scorned to fly: Thrice with extended arms he met and cursed The fugitives on rushing. As they passed He flung his crownèd helm into the wave And bit his brazen shield, above its rim Levelling a look that smote with chill like death Their hearts that saw it. Yet one moment more He sat like statue on some sculptured horse With upraised hand, close-clenched, denouncing Heaven: Then burst his mighty heart. As stone he fell Dead on the plain. Not less in after times Mercian to Mercian said, ‘Without a wound King Penda died, although on battle-field, Therefore with Odin Penda shares not feast.’ Thus pagan died old Penda as he lived: Yet Penda's sons were Christian, kindlier none; His daughters nuns; and lamb-like Mercia's House, Lion one while, made end. King Oswy raised His monasteries twelve: benigner life Around them spread: wild waste, and robber bands Vanished: the poor were housed, the hungry fed: And Oswy sent his little new-born babe Dewed with her mother's tear-drops, Eanfleda, Like some young lamb with fillet decked and flower Yet dedicated not to death, but life, To Hilda sent on Whitby's sea-washed hill, Who made her Bride of Christ. The years went by, And Oswy, now an old king, glory-crowned, His country from the Mercian thraldom loosed And free from north to south, in heart resolved A pilgrim, Romeward faring with bare feet, To make his rest by Peter's tomb and Paul's. God willed not thus: within his native realm The sickness unto death clasped him with hold Gentle but firm. Long sleepless, t'ward the close Amid his wanderings smiling, from the couch He stretched a shrivelled hand, and pointing said, ‘Who was it fabled she had died in age? In all her youthful beauty holy and pure, Lo, where she kneels upon the wintry ground, The snow-flakes circling round her, yet with face Bright as a star!’ so spake the king, and taking Into his heart that vision, slept in peace. His daughter, abbess then on Whitby's height, Within her church interred her father's bones Beside her grandsire's, Edwin. Side by side They rested, one Bernicia's king, and one Dëira's—great Northumbria's sister realms; Long foes, yet blended by that mingling dust. THE VENGEANCE OF THE MONKS OF BARDENEY Osthryda, Queen of Mercia, translates the relics of her uncle, Oswald of Northumberland, to the Abbey of Bardeney. The monks refuse them admittance because King Oswald had conquered and kept for one year Lindsay, a province of Mercia. Though hourly expecting the destruction of their Abbey, they will yield neither to threats nor to supplications, nor even to celestial signs and wonders. At last, being convinced by the reasoning of a devout man, they repent of their anger. Silent, with gloomy brows in conclave sat The monks of Bardeney, nigh the eastern sea; Rumour, that still outruns the steps of ill Smote on their gates with news: ‘Osthryda comes To bury here her royal uncle's bones, Northumbrian Oswald.’ Oswald was a Saint; Had loosed from Pagan bonds that Christian land His own by right. But Oswald had subdued Lindsay, a Mercian province; and the monks Were sons of Mercia leal and true. Osthryda, Northumbrian born, had wedded Mercia's King; Therefore the monks of Bardeney pondered thus: ‘This Mercian Queen spurns her adopted country! Must Mercia therefore build her conqueror's tomb? Though earth and hell cried “Ay,” it should not be!’ Thus mused the brethren till the sun went down: Then lo! beyond a vista in the woods Drew nigh a Bier, black-plumed, with funeral train: Thereon the stern monks gazed, and gave command To close the Abbey's gate. Beside that gate Tent-roofed that Bier remained. Before them soon Stood up the royal herald. Thus he spake: ‘Ye sacred monks of Bardeney's Abbey, hail! Osthryda, wife of Ethelred our King, Prays that God's peace may keep this House forever. The Queen has hither brought, by help of God King Oswald's bones, and sues for them a grave Within this hallowed precinct.’ Answer came: ‘King Oswald, living, was Northumbria's King; King Oswald, by the pride of life seduced Wrested from Mercia's sceptre Lindsay's soil; Therefore in Lindsay's soil King Oswald, dead, May never find repose.’ Before them next Three earls advanced full-armed, and spake loud-voiced: ‘Our Queen is consort of the Mercian King; Ye, monks, are Mercian subjects! Sirs, beware! Our King and Queen have loved you well till now, And ranked your abbey highest in their realm: But hearts ingrate can sour the mood of love; And Ethelred, though mild as summer skies When mildly used, once angered’—Answer came: ‘We know it, and await our doom, content: If Mercia's King contemns his realm, more need That Mercia's priests her confessors should die: In Bardeney's church King Oswald ne'er shall rest: Ye have your answer, Earls!’ Through that dim hall Ere long a gentler embassage made way, Three priests; arrived, they knelt, and, reverent, spake: ‘Fathers and brethren, Oswald was a Saint! He loosed his native land from pagan thrall: Churches and convents everywhere he built: His relics, year by year, grow glorious more Through miracles and signs. Fathers revered, Within this sanctuary beloved of God Vouchsafe his dust interment!’ They replied: ‘We know that Oswald is a Saint with God: We know he freed his realm from pagan thrall; We know that churches everywhere he built; We know that from his relics Grace proceeds As light from sun and moon. In heaven a crown Rests on Saint Oswald's head: yet here on earth King Oswald's foot profaned our Mercian bound: Therefore in Mercian earth he finds not grave.’ Silent those priests withdrew. An hour well-nigh Went by in silence. Then with forehead crowned And mourner's veil, and step of one that mourns, The Queen advanced, a lady at each side, And 'mid the circle stood, and thus implored: ‘Not as your Sovereign come I, holy Sirs, Since all are equal in the House of God; Nor stand I here a stranger. Many a day In this your church, I knelt, while yet a child; Then too, as now, within my breast there lived The tenderest of its ardours and the best, Zeal for my kinsman's fame. That time how oft I heard my Father, Oswy, cry aloud, “O Brother, had I walked but in thy ways My foot had never erred!” In maiden youth I met with one who shared my loyal zeal, Mercian himself: 'twas thus he won my heart: My royal husband shared it; shares this hour My trust that 'mid the altars reared by us To grace this chiefest Minster of our realm May rest the relics of our household Saint— To spurn them from your threshold were to shame.’ She spake: benign and soft the answering voice: ‘Entreat us not, thou mourner true and kind, Lest we, by pity from the straight path drawn, Sin more than thou. Thou know'st what thing love is, Thus loving one who died before thy birth! Up to the measure of high love and fit Thou lov'st him for this cause, because thy heart Hath never rested on base love and bad: Lady, a sterner severance monks have made: Not base and bad alone do they reject, But lesser good for better and for best: Therefore what yet remains they love indeed: A single earthly love is theirs unblamed, Their Country! Lo, the wild-bird loves her nest, Lions their caves:—to us God gave a Country. What heart of man but loves that mother-land Whose omnipresent arms are round him still In vale and plain; whose voice in every stream; Whose breath his forehead cools; whose eyes with joy Regard her offspring issuing forth each morn On duteous tasks; to rest each eve returning? And who that loves her but must hate her foes? Lady, accept God's Will, nor strive by prayer To change it. In our guest-house rest this night, Thou, and thy train.’ Severe the Queen replied: ‘Yea in thy guest-house I will lodge this night, Unvanquished, undiscouraged, not to cease From prayer: of that be sure. I make henceforth My prayer to God, not man. To Him I pray, That Lord of all, Who changes at His will The stony heart to flesh.’ She spake: then turned On those old faces, keenlier than before, Her large slow eyes; and instant in her face The sadness deepened: but the wrath was gone. That sadness said, ‘Love then as deep as mine, And grief like mine, in other breasts may spring From source how different!’ Long she gazed, like child That knows not she is seen to gaze, with looks As though she took that hoary-headed band Into her sorrowing heart. Silent she sighed; Then passed into the guest-house with her train: There prayed all night for him, that Saint in heaven Ill-honoured upon earth. Within their church Meantime the monks the ‘Dies Iræ’ sang, The yellow tapers ranged as round a corse, And Penitential Psalms in order due. Their rite was for the living: ere the time They sang the obsequies of sentenced men, Foreboding wrath to come. Sad Fancy heard The flames up-rushing o'er their convent home, The ruin of their church late-built, the wreck It might be of their Order. Fierce they knew That Mercian royal House! Against their King They hurled no ban: venial they deemed his crime: ‘He moves within the limits of his right, Though wrongly measuring right. He sees but this, His subjects break his laws. Some sin of youth It may be hides from him a right more high:’ Thus spake they in their hearts. While rival thus The brethren and the Queen sent up their prayer, And sacred night hung midway in her course, Behold, there fell from God tempest and storm Buffeting that abbey's walls. The woods around Devastated by stress of blast on blast, Howled like the howling of wild beasts when fire Invests their ambush, and their cubs late-born Blaze in red flame. Trembling, the strong-built towers Echoed the woodland moans. All night the Queen, Propped by those two fair Seraphs, Faith and Love, Prayed on in hope, or hearing not that storm, Or mindful that where danger most abounds There God is nearest still. Meantime the Tent Covering that royal Bier, unshaken stood Beside the unyielding abbey-gates close-barred, Like something shielded by a heavenly charm: When morning came, shattered all round it lay Both trunk and bough; but in the rising sun The storm-drop shook not on that snowy shrine. Things wondrous more that Legend old records: An hour past sunrise from the meads and moors Came wide-eyed herdsmen thronging, with demand, ‘What means this marvel? All the long still night, While heaven and earth were dark, and peaceful sleep Closed in her arms the wearied race of men, Keeping our herds on meads and moorlands chill, We saw a glittering Tent beside your gates: Above it, and not far, a pillar stood, All light, and high as heaven!’ The abbot answered, ‘Fair Sirs, ye dreamed a dream; and sound your sleep Untroubled by the terror of the storm Whereof those woodland fragments witness still, And many a forest patriarch prostrate laid: There rose no pillar by our gates: yon Tent Stood there, and stood alone.’ In two hours' space Shepherds arrived, from hills remoter sped, Making the same demand. With eye ill pleased Thus answered brief the prior: ‘Friends, ye jest!’ And they in wrath departed. Once again Came foresters from Lindsay's utmost bound, On horses blown, and spake: ‘O'er yonder Tent, Through all the courses of the long still night, Behold, a shining pillar hovering stood: It rained a glory on your convent walls: It flung a trail of splendour o'er your woods: We watched it hour by hour. Like Oswald's Cross On Heaven-Field planted in the days of old, It waxed in height:—the stars were quenched.’ Replied With reddening brows the youngest of those monks, ‘Sirs, ye have had your bribe, and told your tale: Depart!’ and they departed great in scorn. Long time the brethren sat; discoursed long time Each with his neighbour. ‘Craft of man would force Dishonest deed on this our holy House, By miracles suborned;’ thus spake the first: The second answered, ‘Ay, confederates they! The good Queen knew not of it:’ then the third, ‘Not so! these men are simple folks, I ween: Nor time for fraud had they. What sail is yon So weather-worn that nears the headland?’ Soon A pilot stood before them; at his side A priest, long years an inmate of their House, But late a pilgrim in the Holy Land. Their greetings over, greetings warm and kind, Thus spake the Pilgrim: ‘Brothers mine, rejoice; Our God is with us! For our House I prayed Three times with forehead on the Tomb of Christ; Last night there came to me, in visible form, An answer to that prayer. All day our ship, Before a great wind rushed t'ward Mercian shores: To them I turned not: on the East I gazed: “O happy East,” I mused, “O Land, true home Of every Christian heart! The Saviour's feet Thy streets, thy cornfields trod! With these compared Our country's self seems nothing!” In my heart Imaged successive, rose once more those sites Capernaum, Nain, Bethsaida, Bethlehem— Where'er my feet had strayed. At midnight, cries Of wonder rang around me, and I turned: I saw once more our convent on its hill: I saw beside its gate a Tent snow-white; I saw a glittering pillar o'er that Tent 'Twixt heaven and earth suspense! Serene it shone, Such pillar as led forth the Chosen Race By night from Egypt's coasts. From wave to wave Moon-like it paved a path! I cried, “Thank God! For who shall stay yon splendour till it reach That Syrian shore? England,” I said, “my country, Shall lay upon Christ's Tomb a hand all light, Whatever tempest shakes the world of men, Thenceforth His servant vowed!”’ When ceased that voice There fell upon the monks a crisis strange; And where that Pilgrim looked for joy, behold, Doubt, wrath, and anguish! Faces old long since Grew older, stricken as by hectic spasm, So fierce a pang had clutched them by the throat; While drops of sweat on many a wrinkled brow Hung large like dewy beads condensed from mist On cliffs by torrents shaken. Mute they sat; Then sudden rose, uplifting helpless hands, As when from distant rock sore-wounded men, Who all day long have watched some dreadful fight, Behold it lost, or else foresee it lost, And with it lost their country's hearths and homes, And yet can bring no succour. Thus with them: They knew themselves defeated; deemed the stars Of heaven had fought against them in their course; Yet still believed, and could not but believe Their cause the cause of Justice, and its wreck The wreck of priestly honour, patriot faith: At last the youngest of the brethren spake; ‘Come what come may, God's monks must guard the Right.’ Death-like a silence on that conclave fell. Then rose a monk white-headed, well-nigh blind, Esteemed a Saint, who had not uttered speech Since came the tidings of the Queen's resolve: Low-voiced he spake, with eyes upon the ground And inward smile that dimly reached his lips: ‘Brethren, be wary lest ye strive with God Through wrath, that blind incontinence of age, For what He wills He works. By passion warped Ye deem this trial strange, this conflict new, Yourselves doomed men that stand between two Fates, On one side right, on one side miracles! Brethren, the chief of miracles is this, That knowing what ye know ye know no more: Ye know long since that Oswald is a Saint: Ye know the sins of Saints are sins forgiven: What then? Shall man revenge where God forgives? Be wroth with those He loves? Ye, seeing much, See not the sun at noontide! God last night Sent you in love a miracle of love To quell in you a miracle of wrath:— Discern its import true! Sum up the past! Thus much is sure: we heard those thunder peals Unheard by hind or shepherd, near or far: 'Tis sure not less that light the shepherds saw We saw not; neither we nor yet the Queen. What then? Is God not potent to divulge The thing He wills, or hide it? Brethren, God Shrouding from us that beam far dwellers saw Admonished us perchance that far is near; That ofttimes distance makes intelligible What, night at hand, is veiled. This too He taught, That when Northumbrian foot our Mercia spurned The men who saw that ruin saw not all: The light of Christ drew near us in that hour; His pillar o'er us stood, and in our midst: The pang, the shame, were transient. See the whole!’ The old man paused a space, and then resumed: ‘Brethren, that day our country suffered wrong: One day she may inflict it. Years may bring The aggressor of past time a penitent grief; The wronged may meet her penitence with scorn Guiltier through malice than her foe's worst rage: Were it not well to leave that time unborn Magnanimous ensample? Hard it were To lay in Mercian earth the unforgiven: Wholly to pardon—that I deem not hard. My voice is this: forgive we Oswald's sin, And lay his relics in our costliest shrine!’ Thus spake the aged man. That self-same eve, The western sun descending, while the church, Grey shaft transfigured by the glow divine, Grey wall in flame of light pacific washed, Shone out all golden like that flower all gold Which shoots through sunset airs an arrowy beam, In charity perfected moved the monks, No longer sad, a long procession forth, With foreheads smoothed as by the kiss of death And eyes like eyes of Saints from death new risen, Bearing the relics of Northumbria's King, Oswald, the man of God. Behind them paced Warriors and chiefs; Osthryda last, the Queen, With face whereon that great miraculous light, By her all night unseen, appeared to rest, And foot that might have trod the ocean waves Unwetted save its palm. A shrine gem-wrought Received the royal relics. O'er them drooped Northumbria's standard, guest of Mercian airs Through which it once had sailed, a portent dire: And whosoe'er in after centuries knelt On Oswald's grave, and, praying, wooed his prayer, Departed, in his heart the peace of God, Passions corrupt expelled, and demon snares, Irreverent love, and anger past its bound. HOW SAINT CUTHBERT KEPT HIS PENTECOST AT CARLISLE. Saint Cuthbert while a boy wanders among the woods of Northumbria, bringing solace to all. Later he lives alone in the island of Farne. Being made bishop, many predict that he will be able neither to teach his people nor to rule his diocese. His people flock to him gladly, but require that he should teach them by parable and tale. This he does, and likewise rules his diocese with might. He discourses concerning common life. Keeping his Pentecost at Carlisle, he preaches on that Feast and the Resurrection from the Dead. Herbert, an eremite, beseeching him that the two may die the same day, he prays accordingly, and they die the same hour. Saint Cuthbert, yet a youth, for many a year Walked up and down the green Northumbrian vales Well loving God and man. The rockiest glens And promontories shadowing loneliest seas, Where lived the men least cared for, most forlorn, He sought, and brought to each the words of peace. Where'er he went he preached that God all Love: For, as the sun in heaven, so flamed in him That love which later fired Assisi's Saint: Yea, rumour ran that every mountain beast Obeyed his loving call; that when all night He knelt upon the frosty hills in prayer The hare would couch her by his naked feet And warm them with her fur. To manhood grown He dwelt in Lindisfarne; there, year by year Prospering yet more in vigil and in fast; And paced its shores by night, and blent his hymns With din of waves. Yet ofttimes o'er the strait He passed, once more in search of suffering men Wafting them solace still. Where'er he went Those loved as children first, again he loved As youth and maid, and in them nursed that Faith Through which pure youth passes o'er passion's waves Like Him Who trod that Galilean sea: He clasped the grey-grown sinner in his arms And won from him repentance long delayed, Then with him shared the penance he enjoined. O heart both strong and tender! offering Mass Awe-struck he stood as though on Calvary's height: The men who marked him shook. Twelve winters passed: Then mandate fell upon the Saint from God, Or breathed upon him from the heavenly height, Or haply from within. It drave him forth A hermit into solitudes more stern. ‘Farewell,’ he said, ‘my brethren and my friends! No holier life than yours, pure Cœnobites Pacing one cloister, sharing one spare meal, Chanting to God one hymn! yet I must forth— Farewell, my friends, farewell!’ On him they gazed And knew that God had spoken to his soul And silent stood though sorrowing. Long that eve The brethren grieved noting his vacant stall, Yet thus excused their sadness: ‘Well for him, And high his place in heaven; but woe to those Henceforth of services like his amerced! Here lived he in the world; here many throng; To him in time some lesser bishopric Might well have fallen, behoof of countless souls! Such dream is past forever.’ Forth he fared To Farne, a little rocky islet nigh, Where man till then had never dared to dwell By dreadful rumours scared. In narrow cave Worn from the rock, and roughly walled around, The anchoret made abode, with lonely hands Raising from one poor strip his daily food Barley thin-grown, and coarse. He saw by day The clouds on-sailing, and by night the stars; And heard the eternal waters. Thus recluse The man lived on in vision still of God Through contemplation known: and as the shades Each other chase all day o'er steadfast hills, Even so, athwart that Vision unremoved Forever rushed the tumults of this world, Man's fleeting life, the rise and fall of states, While changeless measured change; the spirit of prayer Fanning that wondrous picture oft to flame Until the glory grew insufferable. Long years thus lived he. As the Apostle Paul Though raised in raptures to the heaven of heavens, Not therefore loved his brethren less, but longed To give his life—his all—for Israel's sake So Cuthbert, loving God, loved man the more, His wont of old. To him the mourners came, And sinners bound by Satan. At his touch Their chains fell from them light as summer dust: Each word he spake was as a Sacrament Clothed with God's grace; beside his feet they sat, And in their perfect mind; thence through the world Bare their deliverer's name. So passed his life: There old he grew, and older yet appeared, By fasts outworn, though ever young at heart; When lo! before that isle a barge there drew Bearing the royal banner. Egfrid there With regal sceptre sat, and many an earl, And many a mitred bishop at his side. Northumbria's see was void: a council's voice Joined with a monarch's called him to its throne: In vain he wept, and knelt, and sued for grace: Six months' reprieve alone he won; then ruled In Lindisfarne, chief bishop of the North. But certain spake who deemed that they were wise, Fools all beside: ‘Shall Cuthbert crosier lift? A child, 'tis known he herded flocks for hire, Housed in old Renspid's hut, his Irish nurse, Who told him tales of Leinster Kings, his sires ‘L'origine irlandaise de Cuthbert est affirmé sans réserve par Reeves dans ses Notes sur Wattenbach, p. 5. Lanigan (c. iii. p. 88) constate qu'Usher, Ware, Colgan, en ont eu la même opinion. . . . Beaucoup d'autres anciens auteurs irlandais et anglais en font un natif de l'Irlande.’—Montalembert, Les Moines d'Occident, tome ii. pp. 391-2. And how her hands, their palace wrecked in war Had snatched him from its embers. Yet a boy He rode to Melrose and its wondering monks, A mimic warrior, in his hand a lance, With shepherd youth for page, and spake: “'Tis known Christ's kingdom is a kingdom militant: A son of Kings I come to guard His right And battle 'gainst his foes!” For lance and sword A book they gave him; and they made him monk: Savage since then he couches on a rock As fame reports, with birds' nests in his beard! Can dreamers change to Bishops? Vision-dazed Move where he may that slowly wandering eye Will see in man no more than kites or hawks; Men, if they note, will flee him.’ Thus they buzzed, Self-praised, and knowing not that simpleness Is sacred soil, and sown with royal seed The heroic seed and saintly. Mitred once Such gibes no more assailed him: one short month Sufficed the petty cavil to confute; One month well chronicled in book which verse Late born, alas, in vain would emulate. At once he called to mind the days that were; His wanderings in Northumbrian glens; the hearths That welcomed him so joyously; at once Within his breast the heart parental yearned; He longed to see his children, scattered wide From Humber's bank to Tweed, from sea to sea, And cried to those around him: ‘Let us forth, And visit all my charge: and since Carlisle Remotest sits upon its western bound, Keep there this year our Pentecost!’ Next day He passed the sands left hard by ebbing tide His cross-bearer and brethren six in front And trod the mainland. Reverent, first he sought His childhood's nurse, and 'neath her humble roof Abode one night. To Melrose next he fared Honouring his master old. Southward once more Returning, scarce a bow-shot from the woods There rode to him a mighty thane, one-eyed, With warriors circled, on a jet-black horse, Barbaric shape and huge, yet frank as fierce Who thus made boast: ‘A Jute devout am I! What raised that convent-pile on yonder rock? This hand! I wrenched the hillside from a foe By force, and gave it to thy Christian monks To spite yet more those Angles! Island Saint, Unprofitable have I found thy Faith! Behold, those priests, thy thralls, are savage men, Unrighteous, ruthless! For a sin of mine They laid on me a hundred days of fast! A man am I keen-witted: friend and liege I summoned, shewed my wrong, and ended thus: “Sirs, ye are ninety-nine, the hundredth I; I counsel that we share this fast among us! To-morrow from the dawn to evening's star No food as bulky as a spider's tongue Shall pass our lips; and thus in one day's time My hundred days of fast shall stand fulfilled.” Wrathful they rose, and sware by Peter's keys That fight they would, albeit 'gainst Peter's self; But fast they would not save for personal sins. Signal I made: then backward rolled the gates, And, captured thus, they fasted without thanks, Cancelling my debt—a hundred days in one! Beseech you, Father, chide your priests who breed Contention thus 'mid friends!’ The Saint replied ‘Penance is irksome, Thane: to 'scape its scourge Ways are there various; and the easiest this, Keep far from mortal sin.’ Where'er he faced The people round him pressed—the sick, the blind, Young mothers sad because a babe was pale; Likewise the wives of fishers praying loud Their husbands' safe return. Rejoiced he was To see them, hear them, touch them; wearied never: Whate'er they said delighted still he heard: The rise and fall of empires touched him less, The book rich-blazoned, or the high-towered church: ‘We have,’ he said ‘God's children, and their God: The rest is fancy's work.’ Him too they loved; Loved him the more because, so great and wise He stumbled oft in trifles. Once he said, ‘How well those pine-trees shield the lamb from wind!’ A smile ran round; at last the boldest spake ‘Father, these are not pine-trees—these are oaks.’ And Cuthbert answered, ‘Oaks, good sooth, they are! In youth I knew the twain apart: the pine Wears on his head the Cross. ’Instruction next He gave them, how the Cross had vanquished sin: Then first abstruse to some appeared his words, ‘Father,’ they answered, ‘speak in parables! For pleasant is the tale, and, onward passed, Keeps in our heart thy lesson.’ While they spake A youth rich-vested tossed his head and cried: ‘Father, why thus converse with untaught hinds? Their life is but the life of gnats and flies: They think but of the hour. Behold yon church! I reared it both for reverence of thy Christ And likewise that through ages yet to come My name might live in honour!’ At that word Cuthbert made answer: ‘Hear the parable! My people craved for such. A monk there lived Holiest of men reputed. He was first On winter mornings in the freezing stall; Meekest when chidden; fervent most in prayer: And, late in life, when heresies arose, That book he wrote, like tempest winged from God, Drave them to darkness back. Grey-haired he died; With honour was interred. The years went by; His grave they opened. Peacefully he slept, Unchanged, the smile of death upon his lips: O'er the right hand alone, for so it seemed, Had Death retained his power: five little lines, White ashes, showed where once the fingers lay. All saw it—simple, learned, rich and poor: None might divine the cause. That night, behold! A Saintly Shape beside the abbot stood, Bright like the sun except one lifted palm: Thereon there lay a stain. “Behold that hand!” The Spirit spake, “that, toiling twenty years Sent forth that book which pacified the world; For it the world would canonise me Saint! See that ye do it not! Inferior tasks I wrought for God alone. Building that book Too oft I mused, ‘Far years will give thee praise.’ I expiate that offence.”’ Another day A sweet-faced woman raised her voice, and cried, ‘Father! those sins denounced by God I flee; Yet tasks imposed by God too oft neglect: Stands thus a soul imperilled?’ Cuthbert spake: ‘Ye sued for parables; I speak in such Though ill, a language strange to me, and new. There lived a man who shunned committed sin, Yet daily by omission sinned and knew it: In his own way, not God's, he served his God; And there was with him peace; yet not God's peace. So passed his youth. In age he dreamed a dream: He dreamed that, being dead, he raised his eyes, And saw a mountain range of frozen snows, And heard “Committed sins innumerable Though each one small, so small thou knew'st them not, Uplifted, flake by flake as sin by sin, Yon barrier 'twixt thy God and thee! Arise, Remembering that of sins despair is worst: Be strong, and scale it!” Fifty years he scaled Those hills; so long it seemed. A cavern next Entering, with mole-like hands he scooped his way, And reached at last the gates of morn. Ah me! A stone's cast from him rose the tree of Life: He heard its sighs ecstatic: Full in view The Beatific River rolled; beyond All-glorious shone the City of the Saints Clothed with God's light! And yet from him that realm Was severed by a gulf! Not wide that strait; It seemed a strong man's leap twice told—no more; But, as insuperably soared that cliff, Unfathomably thus its sheer descent Walled the abyss. Again he heard that Voice: “Henceforth no place remains for active toils, Penance for acts perverse. Inactive sloth Through passive suffering meets its due. On earth That sloth a nothing seemed; a nothing now That chasm whose hollow bars thee from the Blest, Poor slender film of insubstantial air. Self-help is there denied thee: for that cause A twofold term thou need'st of pain love-taught To expiate Love that lacked.” That term complete An angel caught him o'er that severing gulf: Thenceforth he saw his God.’ With such discourse Progress, though slow and interrupted oft, The Saint of God, by no delay perturbed, Made daily through his sacred charge. One eve He walked by pastures arched along the sea, With many companied. The on-flowing breeze Glazed the green hill-tops, bending still one way The glossy grasses; limitless below The ocean mirror, clipped by cape or point With low trees inland leaning, lay like lakes Flooding rich lowlands. Southward far, a rock Touched by a rainy beam, emerged from mist, And shone, half green, half gold. That rock was Farne: Though strangers, those that kenned it guessed its name: ‘Doubtless 'twas there,’ they said, ‘our Saint abode!’ Then pressed around him, questioning: ‘Rumour goes, Father beloved, that in thine island home Thou sat'st all day with hammer small in hand, Shaping, from pebbles veined, miraculous beads That save their wearers still from sword and lance:— Are these things true?’ Smiling the Saint replied: ‘True, and not true! That isle in part is spread With pebbles divers-fashioned, some like beads: I gathered such, and gave to many a guest, Adding, “Such beads shall count thy nightly prayers; Pray well; then fear no peril!”’ Others came And thus demanded: ‘Rumour fills the world, Father, that birds miraculous crowned thine isle, And awe-struck let thee lift them in thy hand, Though scared by all beside.’ Smiling once more The Saint made answer, ‘True, and yet not true! Sea-birds elsewhere beheld not throng that isle; A breed so loving and so firm in trust That, yet unharmed by man, they flee not man; Wondering they gaze; who wills may close upon them! I signed a league betwixt that race and man: Pledging the mariners who sought my cell To reverence still that trust.’ He ended thus: ‘My friends, ye seek me still for parables; Seek them from Nature rather:—here are two! Those pebble-beads are words from Nature's lips Exhorting man to pray; those fearless birds Teach him that trust to innocence belongs By right divine, and more avails than craft To shield us from the aggressor.’ Some were glad Hearing that doctrine; others cried, ‘Not so! Our Saint—all know it—makes miraculous beads; But, being humble, he conceals his might:’ And many an age, when slept that Saint in death, Passing his isle by night the sailor heard Saint Cuthbert's hammer clinking on the rock; And age by age men cried, ‘Our Cuthbert's birds Revere the Saint's command.’ While thus they spake A horseman over moorlands near the Tweed Made hasty way, and thus addressed the Saint: ‘Father, Queen Ermenburga greets thee well, And this her message:—“Queen am I forlorn, Long buffeted by many a storm of State, And worn at heart besides; for in our house Peace lived not inmate, but a summer guest; And now, my lord, the King is slain in fight; And changed the aspect now things wore of old: Thou therefore, man of God, approach my gates With counsel sage. This further I require; Thy counsel must be worthy of a Queen, Nor aught contain displeasing.”’ Cuthbert spake: ‘My charge requires my presence at Carlisle; Beseech the Queen to meet me near its wall On this day fortnight.’ Thitherwards thenceforth Swiftlier he passed, while daily from the woods The woodmen flocked, and shepherds from the hills, Concourse still widening. These among there moved A hermit meek as childhood, calm as eld, Long years Saint Cuthbert's friend. Recluse he lived Within a woody isle of that fair lake By Derwent lulled and Greta. Others thronged Round Cuthbert's steps; that hermit stood apart With large dark eyes upon his countenance fixed And pale cheek dewed with tears. The name he bore Was ‘Herbert of the Lake.’ Two weeks went by, And Cuthbert reached his journey's end. Next day God sent once more His Feast of Pentecost To gladden men; and all His Church on earth Shone out, irradiate as by silver gleams Flashed from her whiter Sister in the skies; And every altar laughed, and every hearth; And many a simple hind in spirit heard The wind which through that ‘upper chamber’ swept Careering through the universe of God, New life through all things poured. Cuthbert that day, Borne on by wingèd winds of rapturous thought, Forth from Carlisle had fared alone, and reached Ere long a mead tree-girded;—in its midst Swift-flowing Eden raced from fall to fall, Showering at times her spray on flowers as fair As graced that earlier Eden; flowers so light Each feeblest breath impalpable to man Now shook them and now swayed. Delighted eye The Saint upon them fixed. Ere long he gazed As glad on crowds thronging the river's marge, For now the high-walled city poured abroad Her children rich and poor. At last he spake: ‘Glory to Him Who made both flowers and souls! He doeth all things well! A few weeks past Yon river rushed by wintry banks forlorn; What decks it thus to-day? The voice of Spring! She called those flowers from darkness forth; she flashed Her life into the snowy breast of each: This day she sits enthroned on each and all: The thrones are myriad; but the Enthroned is One!’ ‘Oft as Spring Decks on thy sinuous banks her thousand thrones, Seats of glad instinct, and love's carolling.’ Wordsworth (addressed to the river Greta). He paused; then, kindling, added thus: ‘O friends! 'Tis thus with human souls through faith re-born: One Spirit calls them forth from darkness; shapes One Christ, in each conceived, its life of life; One God finds rest enthroned on all. Once more The thrones are many; but the Enthroned is One!’ Again he paused, and mused; again he spake: ‘Yea, and in heaven itself, a hierarchy There is that glories in the name of “Thrones:” The high cherubic knowledge is not theirs: Not theirs the fiery flight of Seraph's love, But all their restful beings they dilate To make a single, myriad throne for God— Children, abide in unity and love! So shall your lives be one long Pentecost, Your hearts one throne for God!’ As thus he spake A breeze, wide-wandering through the woodlands near, Illumed their golden roofs, while louder sang The birds on every bough. Then horns were heard Resonant from stem to stem, from rock to rock, While moved in sight a stately cavalcade Flushing the river's crystal. Of that host Foremost and saddest Ermenburga rode, A Queen sad-eyed, with large imperial front By sorrow seamed: a lady rode close by; Behind her earls and priests. Though proud to man Her inborn greatness made her meek to God: She signed the Saint to stay not his discourse, And placed her at his feet. His words were great He spake of Pentecost; no transient grace, No fugitive act, consummated, then gone, But God's perpetual presence in that Church O'er-shadowed still, like Mary, by His Spirit, Fecundated in splendour by His Truth, Made loving through His Love. The reign of Love He showed, though perfected in Christ alone, Not less co-eval with the race of man: For what is man? Not mind: the beasts can think: Not passions; appetites: the beasts have these: Nay, but Affections ruled by Laws Divine: These make the life of man. Of these he spake; Proclaimed of these the glory. These to man Are countless loves revealing Love Supreme: These and the Virtues, warp and woof, enweave A single robe—that sacrificial garb Worn from the first by man, whose every act Of love in spirit was self-sacrifice, And prophesied the Sacrifice Eterne: Through these the world becomes one household vast; Through these each hut swells to a universe Traversed by stateliest energies wind-swift, And planet-crowned, beneath their Maker's eye. All hail, Affections, angels of the earth! Woe to that man who boasts of love to God, And yet his neighbour scorns! While Cuthbert spake A young man whispered to a priest, ‘Is yon That Anchoret of the rock? Where learned he then This loving reverence for the hearth and home? Mark too that glittering brow!’ The priest replied: ‘What! shall a bridegroom's face alone be bright? He knows a better mystery! This he knows, That, come what may, all o'er the earth forever God keeps His blissful Bridal-feast with man: Each true heart there is guest!’ Once more the Saint Arose and spake: ‘O loving friends, my children, Christ's sons, His flock committed to my charge! I spake to you but now of humbler ties, Not highest, with intent that ye might know How pierced are earthly bonds by heavenly beam; Yet, speaking with lame tongue in parables, I showed you but similitudes of things— Twilight, not day. Make question then who will; So shall I mend my teaching.’ Prompt and bright As children issuing forth to holyday, Then flocked to Cuthbert's school full many a man Successive: each with simpleness of heart His doubt propounded; each his question asked, Or, careless who might hear, confessed his sins, And absolution won. Among the rest, A little seven years' boy, with sweet, still face, Yet strong not less, and sage, drew softly near, His great calm eyes upon the patriarch fixed And silent stood. From Wessex came that boy: By chance Northumbria's guest. Meantime a chief Demanded thus: ‘Of all the works of might, What task is worthiest?’ Cuthbert made reply: ‘His who to land barbaric fearless fares, And open flings God's palace gate to all, And cries “Come in!”’ That concourse thrilled for joy: Alone that seven years' child retained the word: The rest forgat it. ‘Winifrede’ that day Men called him; later centuries, ‘Boniface,’ Because he shunned the ill, and wrought the good: In time the Teuton warriors knew that brow, Their great Apostle he: they knew that voice: And happy Fulda venerates this day Her martyr's gravestone. Next, to Cuthbert drew Three maidens hand in hand, lovely as Truth, Trustful, though shy: their thoughts, when hidden most, Wore but a semilucid veil, as when Through gold-touched crystal of the lime new-leaved On April morns the symmetry looks forth Of branch and bough distinct. Smiling, they put At last their question: ‘Tell us, man of God, What life, of lives that women lead, is best; Then show us forth in parables that life!’ He answered: ‘Three; for each of these is best: First comes the Maiden's: she who lives it well Serves God in marble chapel white as snow, His priestess—His alone. Cold flowers each morn She culls ere sunrise by the stainless stream, And lays them on that chapel's altar-stone And sings her matins there. Her feet are swift All day in labours 'mid the vales below, Cheering sad hearts: each evening she returns To that high fane, and there her vespers sings; Then sleeps, and dreams of heaven.’ With witching smile The youngest of that beauteous triad cried: ‘That life is sweetest! I would be that maid!’ Cuthbert resumed: ‘The Christian Wife comes next: She drinks a deeper draught of life: round her In ampler sweep its sympathies extend: An infant's cry has knocked against her heart, Evoking thence that human love wherein Self-love hath least. Through infant eyes a spirit Hath looked upon her, crying, “I am thine! Creature from God; dependent yet on thee!” Thenceforth she knows how greatness blends with weakness; Reverence, thenceforth, with pity linked, reveals To her the pathos of the life of man A thing divine, and yet at every pore Bleeding from crownèd brows. A heart thus large Hath room for many sorrows. What of that? Its sorrow is its dowry's noblest part. She bears it not alone. Such griefs, so shared Sickness, and fear, and vigils lone and long Waken her heart to love sublimer far Than ecstasies of youth could comprehend; Lift her perchance to heights serene as those The Ascetic treadeth.’ ‘I would be that wife;’ Thus cried the second of those maidens three: Yet who that gazed upon her could have guessed Creature so soft could bear a heart so brave? She seemed that goodness which was beauteous too; Virtue at once and Virtue's bright reward; Delight that lifts, not lowers us; made for heaven; Made too to change to heaven some brave man's hearth. She added thus: ‘Of lives that women lead Tell us the third!’ Gently the Saint replied: ‘The third is Widowhood—a wintry sound; And yet, for her who widow is indeed That winter something keeps of autumn's gold, Something regains of Spring's first flower snow-white, Snow-cold, and colder for its rim of green. She feels no more the warmly-greeting hand; The eyes she brightened rest on her no more; Her full-orbed being now is cleft in twain: Her past is dead: daily from memory's self Dear things depart; yet still she is a wife, A wife the more because of bridal bonds Lives but their essence, waiting wings in heaven; More wife; and yet, in that great loneliness, More maiden too than when first maidenhood Lacked what it missed not. Like that other maid She too a lonely Priestess serves her God; Yea, though her chapel be a funeral vault, Its altar black like Death; the flowers thereon, Tinct with the Blood Divine. Above that vault She hears the anthems of the Spouse of Christ, Widowed like her, though Bride.’ ‘O fair, O sweet, O beauteous lives all three; fair lot of woman!’ Thus cried again the youngest of those Three, Too young to know the touch of grief or cause it, A plant too lightly leaved to cast a shade. The eldest with pale cheek, and lids tear-wet, Made answer sad: ‘I would not be a widow.’ Then Cuthbert spake once more with smile benign: ‘I said that each of these three lives is best:— There are who live those three conjoined in one: The nun thus lives! What maid is maid like her Who, free to choose, has vowed a maidenhood Secure 'gainst chance or choice? What bride like her Whose Bridegroom is the spouse of vestal souls? What widow lives in such austere retreat, Such hourly thought of him she ne'er can join Save through the gate of death? If those three lives In separation lived are fair and sweet, How show they, blent in one?’ Of those who heard The most part gladdened; those who knew how high Virtue, renouncing all besides for God, Hath leave to soar on earth. Yet many sighed, Jealous for happy homesteads. Cuthbert marked That shame-faced sadness, and continued thus: ‘To praise the nun reproaches not, O friends, But praises best that life of hearth and home At Cana blessed by Him who shared it not. The uncloistered life is holy too, and oft Through changeful years in soft succession links Those three fair types of woman; holds, diffused, That excellence severe which life detached Sustains in concentration.’ Long he mused; Then added thus: ‘When last I roved these vales There lived, not distant far, a blessed one Revered by all: her name was Ethelreda: I knew her long, and much from her I learned. Beneath her Pagan father's roof there sat Ofttimes a Christian youth. With him the child Walked, calling him “her friend.” He loved the maid: Still young, he drew her to the fold of Christ; Espoused her three years later; died in war Ere three months passed. For her he never died! Immortalised by faith that bond lived on; And now close by, and now 'mid Saints of heaven She saw her husband walk. She never wept; That fire which lit her eye and flushed her cheek Dried up, it seemed, her tears: the neighbours round Called her “the lady of the happy marriage.” She died long since, I doubt not.’ Forward stepped A slight, pale maid, the daughter of a bard, And answered thus: ‘Two months ago she died.’ Then Cuthbert: ‘Tell me, maiden, of her death; And see you be not chary of your words, For well I loved that woman.’ Tears unfelt Fast streaming down her pallid cheek, the maid Replied, yet often paused: ‘A sad, sweet end! A long night's pain had left her living still: I found her on the threshold of her door: Her cheek was white; but, trembling round her lips And dimly o'er her countenance spread, there lay Something that, held in check by feebleness, Yet tended to a smile. A cloak tight-drawn From the cold March wind screened her, save one hand Stretched on her knee, that reached to where a beam Thin slip of watery sunshine, sunset's last, Slid through the branches. On that beam, methought, Rested her eyes half-closed. It was not so: For when I knelt, and kissed that hand ill-warmed, Smiling she said: “The small, unwedded maid Has missed her mark! You should have kissed the ring! Full forty years upon a widowed hand It holds its own. It takes its latest sunshine.” She lived through all that night and died while dawned Through snows Saint Joseph's morn.’ The Queen, with hand Sudden and swift, brushed from her cheek a tear; And many a sob from that thick-crowding host Confessed what tenderest love can live in hearts Defamed by fools as barbarous. Cuthbert sat In silence long. Before his eyes she passed The maid, the wife, the widow, all in one; With these, through these, he saw once more the child, Yea, saw the child's smile on the lips of death, That magic, mystic smile! O heart of man, What strange capacities of grief and joy Are thine! How vain, how ruthless such, if given For transient things alone! O life of man! What wert thou but some laughing demon's scoff If prelude only to the eternal grave! ‘Deep cries to deep’; ay, but the deepest deep Crying to summits of the Mount of God Drags forth for echo, ‘Immortality.’ It was the Death Divine that vanquished death! Shorn of that Death Divine the Life Divine, Albeit its feeblest tear had cleansed all worlds Cancelled all guilt, had failed to reach and sound The deepest in man's nature, Love and Grief, Profoundest each when joined in penitent woe; Failed thence to wake man's hope. The loftiest light Flashed from God's Face on Reason's orient verge Answers that bird-cry from the Heart of man— Poor Heart that, darkling, kept so long its watch The auspice of the dawn. Like one inspired The Saint arose, and raised his hands to God; Then to his people turned with such discourse As mocks the hand of scribe. No more he spake In parables; adumbrated no more ‘Dimly as in a glass’ his doctrine high, But placed it face to face before men's eyes, Essential Truth, God's image, meet for man Himself God's image. Worlds he showed them new, Worlds countless as the stars that roof our night, Fair fruitage of illimitable boughs Pushed from that Tree of life from Calvary sprung That over-tops and crowns the earth and man, Preached the Resurgent, the Ascended God Dispensing ‘gifts to men.’ The tongue he spake Seemed Pentecostal—grace of that high Feast— For all who heard, the simple and the sage, Heard still a single language sounding forth To all one Promise. From that careworn Queen Who doffed her crown, and placed it on the rock Murmuring, ‘Farewell forever, foolish gaud,’ To him the humblest hearer, all made vow To live thenceforth for God. The form itself Of each was changed to saintly and to sweet; Each countenance beamed as though with rays cast down From fiery tongues, or angel choirs unseen. Thus like high gods on mountain-tops of joy Those happy listeners sat. The body quelled— With all that body's might usurped to cramp Through ceaseless, yet unconscious weight of sense Conceptions spiritual, might more subtly skilled Than lusts avowed, to sap the spirit's life— In every soul its nobler Powers released Stood up, no more a jarring crowd confused Each trampling each and oft the worst supreme, Not thus, but grade o'er grade, in order due, And pomp hierarchical. Yet hand in hand, Not severed, stood those Powers. To every Mind That Truth new learned was palpable and dear, Not abstract nor remote, with cordial strength Enclasped as by a heart; through every Heart Serene affections swam 'mid seas of light Reason's translucent empire without bound, Fountained from God. Silent those listeners sat Parleying in wordless thought. For them the world Was lost—and won; its sensuous aspects quenched; Its heavenly import grasped. The erroneous Past Lay like a shrivelled scroll before their feet; And sweet as some immeasurable rose, Expanding leaf on leaf, varying yet one, An Everlasting Present round them glowed. Dead was desire, and dead not less was fear— The fear of change—of death. An hour went by; The sun declined: then rising from his seat Herbert, the anchoret of the lonely lake, Made humble way to Cuthbert's feet with suit: ‘O Father, and O friend, thou saw'st me not; Yet day by day thus far I tracked thy steps At distance, for my betters leaving place, The great and wise that round thee thronged; the young Who ne'er till then had seen thy face; the old Who saw it then yet scarce again may see it. Father, a happier lot was mine, though late, Or had been save for sin of mine: each year I sought thy cell, thy words of wisdom heard; Yet still, alas! lived on like sensual men Who yield their hearts to creatures—fixing long A foolish eye on gold-touched leaf, or flower— Not Him, the great Creator. Father and Friend, The years run past. I crave one latest boon: Grant that we two may die the self-same day!’ Then Cuthbert knelt, and prayed. At last he spake: ‘Thy prayer is heard; the self-same day and hour We two shall die.’ That promise was fulfilled; For two years only on exterior tasks God set His servant's hands, the man who ‘sought In all things rest,’ nor e'er had ceased from rest Then when his task was heaviest. Two brief years He roamed on foot his spiritual realm: The simple still he taught: the sad he cheered: Where'er he went he founded churches still And convents; yea, and, effort costlier far, Spared not to scan defect with vigilant eye: That eye the boldest called not ‘vision-dazed’; That Saint he found no ‘dreamer’: sloth or greed 'Scaped not his vengeance: scandals hid he not, But dragged them into day, and smote them down: Before his face he drave the hireling priest The bandit thane: unceasing cried, ‘Ye kings, Cease from your wars! Ye masters, loose your slaves!’ Two years sufficed; for all his earlier years Had trained the Ascetic for those works of might Beyond the attempt of all but boundless love, And in him kept unspent the fire divine. Never such Bishop walked till then the North, Nor ever since, nor ever, centuries fled, So lived in hearts of men. Two years gone by, His strength decayed. He sought once more his cell Sea-lulled; and lived alone with God; and saw Once more, like lights that sweep the unmoving hills, God's Providences girdling all the world, With glory following glory. Tenderer-souled Herbert meantime within his isle abode, At midnight listening Derwent's gladsome voice Mingling with deep-toned Greta's, ‘Mourner’ named; Pacing, each day, the shore; now gazing glad On gold-touched leaf, or bird that cut the mere, Now grieved at wandering thoughts. For men he prayed; And ever strove to raise his soul to God; And God, Who venerates still the pure intent, Forgat not his; and since his spirit and heart Holy albeit, were in the eyes Divine Less ripe than Cuthbert's for the Vision Blest, Least faults perforce swelling where gifts are vast, That God vouchsafed His servant sickness-pains Virtue to perfect in a little space, That both might pass to heaven the self-same hour. It came: that sun which flushed the spray up-hurled In cloud round Cuthbert's eastern rock, while he Within it dying chanted psalm on psalm, Ere long enkindled Herbert's western lake: The splendour waxed; mountain to mountain laughed, And, brightening nearer drew, and, nearing, clasped That heaven-dropp'd beauty in more strict embrace: The cliffs successive caught their crowns of fire; Blencathara last. Slowly that splendour waned; And from the glooming gorge of Borrodale, Her purple cowl shadowing her holy head O'er the dim lake twilight with silent foot Stepped like a spirit. Herbert from his bed Of shingles watched that sunset till it died; And at one moment from their distant isles Those friends, by death united, passed to God. SAINT FRIDESWIDA, OR THE FOUNDATIONS OF OXFORD. Saint Frideswida died in the same year as the Venerable Bede, viz. A.D. 735. Her story is related by Montalembert, Les Moines d'Occident, vol. v. pp. 298—302, with the following references, viz. Leland, Collectanea, ap. Dugdale, t. i. p. 173; cf. Bolland, t. viii. October, p. 535 à 568. I learn from a Catholic prayerbook published in 1720 that the Saint's Feast used to be kept on the 19th of October. Her remains, as is commonly believed, still exist in the Cathedral of Oxford. Frideswida flies from the pursuit of a wicked king, invoking the Divine aid and the prayers of St. Catherine and St. Cecilia. She escapes; and at the hour of her death those Saints reveal to her that in that place, near the Isis, where she had successively opened a blind man's eyes and healed a leper, God will one day raise up a seat of Learning, the light and the health of the realm. ‘One love I; One: within His bridal bower My feet shall tread: One love I, One alone: His Mother is a Virgin, and His Sire The unfathomed fount of pureness undefiled: Him love I Whom to love is to be chaste: Him love I touched by Whom my forehead shines: Whom she that clasps grows spotless more and more: Behold, to mine His spirit He hath joined: And His the blood that mantles in my cheek: His ring is on my finger.’ Thus she sang; Then walked and plucked a flower: she sang again: ‘That which I longed for, lo, the same I see: That which I hoped for, lo, my hand doth hold: At last in heaven I walk with Him conjoined Whom, yet on earth, I loved with heart entire.’ Thus carolled Frideswida all alone, Treading the opens of a wood far spread Around the upper waters of the Thames. Christian almost by instinct, earth to her Was shaped but to sustain the Cross of Christ. Her mother lived a saint: she taught her child, From reason's dawn, to note in all things fair Their sacred undermeanings. ‘Mark, my child, In lamb and dove, not fleshly shapes,’ she said, ‘But heavenly types: upon the robin's breast Revere that red which bathed her from the Cross With slender bill striving to loose those Nails!’ Dying, that mother placed within her hand A book of saintly legends. Thus the maid Grew up with mysteries clothed, with marvels fed, A fearless creature swift as wind or fire: But fires of hers were spirit-fires alone, All else like winter moon. The Wessex King Had gazed upon the glory of her face And deemed that face a spirit's. He had heard Her voice; it sounded like an angel's song; But wonder by degrees declined to love Such love as Pagans know. The unworthy suit She scorned, from childhood spoused in heart to Christ: She fled: upon the river lay a boat: She rowed it on through forests many a mile; A month had passed since then. Midsummer blazed On all things round: the vast, unmoving groves Stretched silent forth their immemorial arms Arching a sultry gloom. Within it buzzed Feebly the insect swarm: the dragon-fly Stayed soon his flight: the streamlet scarce made way: In shrunken pools, panting, the cattle stood, Languidly browsing on the dried-up sprays: No bird-song shook the bower. Alone that maid Glided light-limbed, as though some Eden breeze Hers only, charioted the songstress on, Like those that serve the May. Beneath a tree Low-roofed at last she sank, with eyes up-raised On boughs that, ivy-twined and creeper-trailed Darkened the shining splendour of the sky: Between their interspaces, here and there, It flashed in purple stars. Enraptured long, For admiration was to her as love, The maiden raised at last her mother's book, And lit upon her childhood's favourite tale, Catherine in vision wed to Bethlehem's Babe Who from His Virgin-Mother leaning, dropped His ring adown her finger. Princely pride And pride not less of soaring intellect At once in her were changed to pride of love: In vain her country's princes sued her grace; Kingdoms of earth she spurned. Around her seat The far-famed Alexandrian Sages thronged, Branding her Faith as novel. Slight and tall, 'Mid them, keen-eyed the wingless creature stood Like daughter of the sun on earth new-lit:— That Faith she shewed to be of all things greatest, All lesser truths its prophets. Swift as beams Forth flashed such shafts of high intelligence That straight their lore sophistic shrivelled up, And Christians they arose. The martyr's wheel Was pictured in the margin, dyed with red, And likewise, azure-tinct on golden ground, Her queenly throne in heaven. ‘Ah shining Saint!’ Half weeping, smiling half, the virgin cried; ‘Yet dear not less thy sister of the West; For never gaze I on that lifted face, Or mark that sailing angel near her stayed, But straight her solemn organs round me swell; All discords cease.’ Then with low voice she read Of Rome's Cecilia, her who won to Christ (That earlier troth inviolably preserved) Her Roman bridegroom wondering at that crown Invisible itself that round her breathed Rose-breath celestial; her that to the Church Gave her ancestral house; and, happier gift, Devotion's heavenliest instrument of praise; Her that, unfearing, dared that Roman sword; And when its work was done, for centuries lay Like marble, 'mid the catacombs unchanged In sleep-resembling death. From earliest dawn That maiden's eyes had watched: wearied at noon Their silver curtains closed. Huge mossy roots Pillowed her head, that slender book wide-leaved In stillness, like some brooding white-winged dove Spread on her bosom: 'gainst its golden edge Rested, gold-tinged, the dimpled ivory chin— Loud thunders broke that sleep; the tempest blast Came up against the woods, while bolt on bolt Ran through them sheer. She started up: she saw That Pagan prince and many a sworded serf Rushing towards her. Fleeter still she fled; But, as some mountain beast tender and slight That, pasturing spring-fed lilies of Cashmere, Or slumbering where its rock-nursed torrents fall, Sudden not distant hears the hunter's cry And mocks pursuit at first, but slackens soon Breathless and spent, so failed her limbs ere long; A horror of great faintness o'er her crept; More near she heard their shout. She staggered on; To threat'ning phantoms all things round were changed; About her towered in ruin hollow trunks Of spiked and branchless trees, survivors sole Of woods that, summer-scorched, then lightning-struck A century past, for one short week had blazed And blackened ever since. She knelt: she raised Her hands to God: she sued for holier prayer Saint Catherine, Saint Cecilia. At that word Behind her close a cry of anguish rang: Silence succeeded. As by angels' help She reached a river's bank: sun-hardened clay Retained the hoof-prints of the drinking herd; And, shallower for long heats, the oxen's ford Challenged her bleeding feet. She crossed unharmed, And soon in green-gold pastures girt by woods Stood up secure. Then forth she stretched her hands, Like Agnes praising God amid the flame: ‘Omnipotent, Eternal, Worshipful, One God, Immense, and All-compassionate, Thou from the sinner's snare hast snatched the feet Of her that loved Thee. Glory to Thy name.’ Thenceforth secure she roamed those woods and meads; The dwellers in that region brought her bread, Upon that countenance gazing, some with awe But all with love. To her the maidens came: ‘Tell us,’ they said, ‘what mystery hast thou learned So sweet and good;—thy Teacher, who was he; Grey-haired, or warrior young?’ To them in turn Ceaseless she sang the praises of her Christ, His Virgin Mother and His heavenly court, Warriors on earth for justice. They for her Renounced all else, the banquet and the dance, And nuptial rites revered. A low-roofed house Inwoven of branches 'mid the woods they raised; There dwelt, and sang her hymn, and prayed her prayer, And loved her Saviour-Sovereign. Year by year More high her bright feet scaled the heavenly mount Of lore divine and knowledge of her God, And with sublimer chant she hymned His praise; While oft some bishop, tracking those great woods In progress to his charge, beneath their roof Baptizing or confirming made abode, And all that lacked supplied, nor discipline Withheld, nor doctrine high. The outward world To them a nothing, made of them its boast: A Saint, it said, within that forest dwelt A Saint that helped their people. Saint she was And therefore wrought for heaven her holy deeds; Immortal stand they on the heavenly roll; Yet fewest acts suffice for heavenly crown; And two of hers had consequence on earth Like water circles widening limitless, For man still helpful. Hourly acts of hers Interior acts invisible to men, Perchance were worthier. Humblest faith and prayer Are oft than miracle miraculous more: To us the exterior marks the interior might: These two alone record we. Years had passed: One day when all the streams were dried by heat And rainless fields had changed from green to brown, T'wards her there drew, by others led, a man Old, worn, and blind. He knelt, and wept his prayer: ‘Help, Saint of God! That impious King am I, That King abhorred, his people's curse and bane, Who chased thee through these woods with fell resolve, Worst vengeance seeking for insulted pride: Rememberest thou that, near thee as I closed Kneeling thou mad'st thy prayer? Instant from God Blindness fell on me. Forward still I rushed, Ere long amid those spiked and branded trunks To lie as lie the dead. If hope remains For me if any hope survives on earth It rests with thee; thee only!’ On her knees She sank in prayer; her fingers in the fount She dipped; then o'er him signed the Saviour's cross, And thrice invoked that Saviour. At her word Behold, that sightless King arose, and saw, And rendered thanks to God. The legend saith Saint Catherine by her stood that night, and spake: ‘Once more I greet thee on thy dying day.’ Again the years went by. That sylvan lodge Had changed to convent. Beautiful it stood Not far from Isis, though on loftier ground: Sad outcasts knew it well: whate'er their need There found they solace. One day toward it moved, Dread apparition and till then unknown, Like one constrained, with self-abhorrent steps, A leper long in forest caverns hid. Back to their cells the nuns had shrunk, o'erawed: Remained but Frideswida. Thus that wretch With scarce organic voice, and aiding sign, Wailed out the supplication of despair: ‘Fly not, O saintly virgin! Yet, ah me! What help though thou remainest? Warned from heaven, I know that not thy fountain's healing wave Could heal my sorrow: not those spotless hands: Not even thy prayer. To me the one sole aid Were aid impossible—a kiss of thine.’ A moment stood she: not in doubt she stood: First slowly, swiftly then to where he knelt She moved: with steadfast hand she raised that cloth Which veiled what once had been a human face: O'er it she signed in faith the cross of Christ; She wept aloud, ‘My brother!’ Folding then Stainless to stained, with arms about him wound In sacred silence mouth to mouth she pressed A long, long sister's kiss. Like infant's flesh The blighted and the blasted back returned: That leper rose restored. The legend saith That Saint Cecilia by her stood that night: ‘Once more I greet thee on thy dying day.’ It came at last, that day. Her convent grew In grace with God and man: the pilgrim old Sought it from far; the gifts of kings enlarged it: It came at last, that day. There are who vouch The splendour of that countenance never waned: Thus much is sure; it waxed to angels' eyes:— Welcomed it came, that day desired, not feared. By humbleness like hers those two fair deeds Were long forgotten: each day had its task: Not hardest that of dying. Why should sobs Trouble the quiet of a holy house Because its holiest passes? Others wept; The sufferer smiled: ‘Ah, little novices, How little of the everlasting lore Your foolish mother taught you if ye shrink From trial light as this!’ She spake; then sank In what to those around her seemed but sleep, The midnoon August sunshine on her hair In ampler radiance lying than that hour When, danger near her yet to her unknown, Beneath that forest tree her eyelids closed— Her book upon her bosom. Near her bed Not danger now but heralds ever young, Saint Catherine, Saint Cecilia, stood once more, Linked hand in hand, with aureoles interwreathed: One gazing stood as though on radiance far With widening eyes: a listener's look intent The other's, soft with pathos more profound. The Roman sister spake: ‘Rejoice, my child, Rejoice, thus near the immeasurable embrace And breast expectant of the unnumbered Blest That swells to meet thee! Yea, and on the earth For thee reward remaineth. Happy thou Through prayer his sight restoring to thy foe, Sole foe that e'er thou knew'st though more his own! Child! darkness is there worse than blindness far Wherein erroneous wanders human Pride; That prayer of thine from age to age shall guard A realm against such darkness. Where yon kine Stand in mid ford, quenching their noontide thirst, Thy footsteps crossed of old the waters. God In the unerasing current sees them still! Close by, a nation from a purer flood Shall quench a thirst more holy, quaffing streams Of Knowledge loved as Truth. Majestic piles Shall rise by yonder Isis, honouring, each, My clear-eyed sister of the sacred East That won to Christ the Alexandrian seers, Winning, herself, from chastity her lore: High on their fronts in statued grandeur ranged With face to East, and cincture never loosed, All Sciences shall stand, daughters divine Of Him that Truth eterne and boon to man Holding in reverent hand, not lamp alone, But lamp and censer both, and both alike From God's great Altar lighted.’ Spake in turn That Alexandrian with the sunlike eyes: ‘Beside those Sciences shall stand a choir As fair as they; as tall; those sister Arts, High daughters of celestial Harmony, Diverse yet one, that bind the hearts of men To steadfast Truth by Beauty's sinuous cords; She that to marble changes mortal thought; She that with rainbow girds the cloud of life; She that above the morning mist exalts Rock-rooted domes of prayer; and she that rears With words auguster temples. Happy thou Healing that leper with thy virgin kiss! A leprosy there is more direful, child!— Therein the nations rot when flesh is lord And spirit dies. Such ruin Arts debased Gender, or, gendered long, exasperate more. But thou, rejoice! From this pure centre Arts Unfallen shall breathe their freshness through the land, With kiss like thine healing a nation's wound Year after year successive; listening, each, My sister's organ music in the skies, Prime Art that, challenging not eye but ear, To Faith is nearest, and of Arts on earth For that cause, living soul.’ That prophecy Found its accomplishment. In later years, There where of old the Oxen had their Ford, The goodliest city England boasts arose, Mirrored in sacred Isis; like that flood Its youth for aye renewing. Convents first Through stately groves levelled their placid gleam, With cloisters opening dim on garden gay Or moonlit lawn dappled by shadowing deer; Above them earliest soared the chapel's bulk With storied window whence, in hues of heaven, Martyrs looked down, or Confessor, or Saint On tomb of Founder with its legend meek ‘Pro animâ orate.’ Night and day Mounted the Church's ever-varying song Sustained on organ harmonies that well Might draw once more to earth, with wings outspread And heavenly face made heavenlier by that strain Cecilia's Angel. Of those convents first Was Frideswida's, ruled in later years By Canons Regular, later yet rebuilt By him of York, that dying wept, alas, ‘Had I but served my Maker as my king!’ To colleges those convents turned; yet still The earlier inspiration knew not change: The great tradition died not: near the bridge From Magdalen's tower still rang the lark-like hymn On May-day morn: high ranged in airy cells, Facing the East, all Sciences, all Arts, And greater far than these all Virtues stood, Best imaged there in no ideal forms, Craft unhistoric of some dreamer's brain, But life-like shapes of plain heroic men Who in their day had fought the fight of Faith, Warriors and sages, poets, saints, and kings, And earned their rest: the long Procession paced, Up winding slow the college-girded street To where in high cathedral slept the Saint, Singing its ‘Alma Redemptoris Mater,’ On August noons, what time the Assumption Feast From purple zenith of the Christian heaven Brightened the earth. That hour not bells alone Chiming from countless steeples made reply: Laughed out that hour high-gabled roof and spire; Kindling shone out those Sciences, those Arts Pagan one time, now confessors white-robed; And all the holy City gave response, ‘Deus illuminatio mea est.’ The motto of the University of Oxford. THE BANQUET HALL OF WESSEX, OR THE KING WHO COULD SEE. Kenwalk, King of Wessex, is a Pagan, but refuses to persecute Christians. He is dethroned by the Mercian King, and lives an exile in a Christian land. There he boasts that he never accords faith to what he hears, and believes only what he sees; yet, his eye being single, he sees daily more of the Truth. Wessex is delivered, and a great feast held at which the Pagan nobles, priests, and bards all conspire for the destruction of the Faith. Birinus, the bishop, having withstood them valiantly, Kenwalk declares himself a Christian. Birinus prophesies of England's greatest King. King Cynegils lay dead, who long and well Had judged the realm of Essex. By his bier The Christians standing smote their breasts, and said, ‘Ill day for us:’ but all about the house Clustering in smiling knots of twos and threes The sons of Odin whispered, or with nods Gave glad assent. Christ's bishop sent from Rome Birinus, to the king had preached for years The Joyous Tidings. Cynegils believed And with him many; but the most refrained: With these was Kenwalk; and, his father dead, Kenwalk was king. A valiant man was he A man of stubborn will, but yet at heart Magnanimous and just. To one who said ‘Strike, for thine hour is come!’ the king new-crowned Made answer, ‘Never! Each man choose his path! My father chose the Christian, Odin's I. I crossed my father oft a living man; I war not on him dead.’ That giant hand Which spared Religion ruled in all beside: He harried forth the robbers from the woods And wrecked the pirates' ships. He burned with fire A judge unjust, and thrice o'er Severn drave The invading Briton. Lastly, when he found That woman in his house intolerable, From bed and realm he hurled her forth though crowned, Ensuing thence great peace. Not long that peace: The Mercian king, her brother, heard her tale With blackening brow. The shrill voice stayed at last, Doubly incensed the monarch made reply: ‘Sister, I never loved you;—who could love? But him who spurned you from his realm I hate: Fear nought! your feast of vengeance shall be full!’ He spake; then cried, ‘To arms!’ In either land, Like thunders low and far, or windless plunge Of waves on coasts long silent that proclaim, Though calm the sea for leagues, tempest far off That shoreward swells, thus day by day was heard The direful preparation for a war Destined no gladsome tournament to prove But battle meet for ancient foes resolved To clear old debts; make needless wars to come. Not long that strife endured; on either side Valour was equal; but on one, conjoined, The skill most practised and the heavier bones: The many fought the few. On that last field 'Twas but the fury of a fell despair Not hope, that held the balance straight so long: Ere sunset all was over. From the field A bleeding remnant dragged their king half dead: The Mercian host pursued not. Many a week Low lay the broken giant nigh to death: At last, like creeping plant down-dragged, not crushed, That, washed by rains, and sunshine-warmed, once more Its length uplifting feels along the air, And gradual finds its 'customed prop, so he, Strengthening each day, with dubious eyes at first Around him peered, but raised at length his head, And, later, question made. His health restored He sought East Anglia, where King Anna reigned, His chief of friends in boyhood. Day by day A spirit more buoyant to the exile came And winged him on his way: his country's bound Once passed, his darker memories with it sank: Through Essex hastening stronger grew his step; East Anglian breezes from the morning sea Fanned him to livelier pulse: wild April growths Gladdened his spirit with glittering green. More fresh He walked because the sun outfaced him not, Veiled, though not his. That shrouded sun had ta'en Its passion from the wild bird's song, but left Quiet felicities of notes low-toned That kept in tune with streams too amply brimmed To chatter o'er their pebbles. Kenwalk's soul Partook not with the poet's. Loveliest sights Like music brightening those it fails to charm, Roused but his mirthful mood. To each that passed He tossed his jest: he scanned the labourer's task; Reviled the luckless boor that ploughed awry And beat the smith that marred the horse's hoof: At times his fortunes thus he moralised: ‘Here walk I, crownless king, and exiled man: My Mercian brother lists his sister's tongue: Say, lark! which lot is happiest?’ Festive streets Tapestries from windows waving, banners borne By white-clad children chanting anthems blithe; With these East Anglia's king received his friend Entering the city gate. In joyous sports That day was passed. At banquet Christian priests Sat with his thanes commingled. Anna's court Was Christian, and, for many a league around, His kingdom likewise. As the earth in May Glistens with vernal flowers, or as the face Of one whose love at last has found return Irradiate shines so shone King Anna's house A home of Christian peace. Fair sight it was— Justice and Love, the only rivals there O'er-ruled it, and attuned. Majestic strength Looked forth in every glance of Anna's eye Too great for pride to dwell there. Tender-souled As that first streak the harbinger of dawn Revealed through cloudless ether, such the queen All charity, all humbleness, all grace All womanhood. Harmonious was her voice, Dulcet her movements, undisguised her thoughts As though they trod an Eden land unfallen And needed raiment none. Some heavenly birth Their children seemed, blameless in word and act, The sisters as their brothers frank, and they Though bolder, not less modest. Kenwalk marked, And marking, mused in silence, ‘Contrast strange These Christians with the pagan races round! Something those pagans see not these have seen: Something those pagans hear not these have heard: Doubtless there's much in common. What of that? 'Tis thus 'twixt man and dog; yet knows the dog His master walks in worlds by him not shared— Perchance for me there may be worlds unknown!’ Thus God to Kenwalk shewed the things that bear Of God true witness, seeing in his soul Justice and Judgment, and, with these conjoined, Valour and Truth: for as the architect On tower four-square and solid plants his spire And not on meads below though gay with flowers On those four virtues God the fabric rears Of virtues loftier yet—those three, heaven-born, And pointing heavenward. To those worlds unknown Kenwalk ere long stood nigh. In three short months The loveliest of those children, and last born, Lay cold in death. Old nurses round her wailed: The mighty heart of Kenwalk shook for dread Entering the dim death-chamber. On a bier The maiden lay, the cross upon her breast: Close by, the mother sat, pale as the child, Yet calm as pale. When Kenwalk near her drew She lifted from that bier a slender book And read that record of the three days' dead Raised by the Saviour from that death-cave sealed A living man. Once more she read those words, ‘I am the Resurrection and the Life,’ Then added, low, with eyes up cast to heaven, ‘With Him my child awaits me.’ Kenwalk saw; And, what he saw believing, half believed— Not more—the things he heard. Yes, half believed; Yet, call it obduracy, call it pride Call it self-fear, or fear of priestly craft He closed his ear against the Word Divine: The thing he saw he trusted; nought beyond. Three years went by. Once, when his friend had named The Name all-blessed, Kenwalk frowned. Since then That Name was named no more. In later days They chased the wild deer; on the billow breathed Inspiring airs; in hall of joyance trod The mazes of the dance. Then war broke out: Reluctant long King Anna sought the field; Hurled back aggression. Kenwalk, near him still, Watched him with insight keener than his wont And, wondering, marked him least to pagans like Inly, when like perforce in outward deed. The battle frenzy took on him no hold: Severe his countenance grew; austere and sad; Fatal, not wrathful. Vicar stern he seemed Of some dread, judgment-executing Power, Against his yearnings; not despite his will. Once, when above the faithless town far off The retributive smoke leaped up to heaven, He closed with iron hand on Kenwalk's arm And slowly spake—a whisper heard afar— ‘See you that town? Its judgment is upon it! I gave it respite twice. This day its doom Is irreversible.’ The invader quelled Anna and Kenwalk on their homeward way Rode by the grave of saintly Sigebert, King Anna's predecessor. Kenwalk spake: ‘Some say the people keep but memory scant Of benefits: I trust the things I see: I never passed that tomb but round it knelt A throng of supplicants! King Sigebert Conversed, men say, with prophet and with seer: I never loved that sort:—who wills can dream— Yet what I see I see.’ ‘They pray for him,’ Anna replied, ‘who perished for their sake: Long years he lived recluse at Edmondsbury, A tonsured monk: around its walls one day Arose that cry, “The Mercian, and his host! Forth, holy King, and lead, as thou wert wont Thy people to the battle, lest they die!” Again I see him riding at their head Lifting a cross, not sword. The battle lost Again I see him fall.’ With rein drawn tight King Kenwalk mused; then smote his hands, and cried ‘My father would have died like Sigebert! He lacked but the occasion!’ After pause, Sad-faced, with bitter voice he spake once more: ‘Such things as these I might have learned at home! I shunned my father's house lest fools might say, “He thinks not his own thoughts.”’ Thus month by month, Though Faith which ‘comes by hearing’ had not come To Kenwalk yet, no less since sight he used In honest sort and resolute to learn, God shewed him memorable things and great Which sight unblest discerns not, tutoring thus A kingly spirit to a kingly part: Before him near Faith lay. The morrow morn Great tidings came: in Wessex war was raised: Kenwalk, departing thus to Anna spake, To Anna, and his consort: ‘Well I know What thanks are those the sole your hearts could prize:’ With voice that shook he added: ‘Man am I That make not pledge: yet, if my father's God Sets free my father's realm—’ again he paused; Then westward rode alone. Well planned, fought well For Kenwalk, of the few reverse makes wise, From him had put his youth's precipitance, That virtuous warfare triumphed. Swift as fire The news from Sherburne and from Winbourne flashed To Sarum, Chertsey, Malmsbury. That delight On earth the nearest to religious joy, The rapture of a trampled land set free, Swelled every breast: the wounded in their wounds Rejoiced, not grieved: the sick forgat their pains: The mourner dashed away her tear and cried ‘Wessex is free!’ Remained a single doubt: Christians crept forth from cave and hollow tree: Once more the exiled monk was seen; and one Who long in minstrel's garb with harp in hand Old, poor, half blind, had sat beside a bridge And, charming first the wayfarer with song, Had won him next with legends of the Cross, Stood up before his altar. Rumour ran ‘Once more Birinus lifts his crosier-staff!’ Then muttered priests of Odin, ‘Cynegils We know was Christian. Kenwalk holds—or held Ancestral Faith, yet warred not on the new: Tolerance means still connivance.’ Peace restored Within King Kenwalk's echoing palace hall, The hall alike of council and of feast, The Great Ones of the Wessex realm were met: Birinus sat among them, eyed from far With anger and with hatred. Council o'er Banquet succeeded, and to banquet song, The Saxon's after-banquet. Many a harp That day by flying hand entreated well Divulged its secret, amorous, or of war; And many a warrior sang his own great deeds Or dirge of ancient friend Valhalla's guest; Nor stinted foeman's praise. Silent meanwhile Far down the board a son of Norway sat, Ungenial guest with clouded brows and stern, And eyes that flashed beneath them: bard was he, Warrior and bard. Not his the song for gold! He sang but of the war-fields and the gods; He lays of love despised. ‘Thy turn is come, Son of the ice-bound North,’ thus spake a thane: ‘Sing thou! The man who sees that face, already Half hears the tempest singing through the pines That shade thy gulfs hill-girt.’ The stranger guest Answered, not rising: ‘Yea, from lands of storm And seas cut through by fiery lava floods I come, a wanderer. Ye, meantime, in climes Balm-breathing, gorge the fat, and smell the sweet: Ye wed the maid whose sire ye never slew And bask in unearned triumph. Feeble spirits! Endless ye deem the splendours of this hour, And call defeat opprobrious! Sirs, our life Is trial. Victory and Defeat are Gods That toss man's heart, their plaything, each to each: Great Mercia knows that truth—of all your realms Faithfullest to Odin far!’ ‘Nay, minstrel, sing,’ Once more, not wroth, they clamoured. He replied: ‘Hear then my song; but not those songs ye sing: I have against you somewhat, Wessex men! Ye are not as your fathers, when, in youth, I trod your coasts. That time ye sang of Gods Sole theme for manlike song. On Iceland's shores We keep our music's virtue undefiled: While summer lasts we fight: by winter hearths Or ranged in sunny coves by winter seas, Betwixt the snow-plains and the hills of fire, Singing we feed on legends of the Gods: Ye sing but triumphs of the hour that fleets; Ye build you kingdoms: next ye dash them down: Ye bow to idols! O that song of mine Might heal this people's wound!’ Then rose the bard And took his harp, and smote it like a man; And sang full-blooded songs of Gods who spurn Their heaven to war against that giant race Throned 'mid the mountains of old Jötunheim That girdle still the unmeasured seas of ice With horror and strange dread. Innumerable In ever-winding labyrinths glacier-thronged Those mountains raise their heads among the stars, That palsied glimmer 'twixt their sunless bulks O'er-shadowing seas and lands. O'er Jötunheim The glittering car of day hath never shone: There endless twilight broods. Beneath it sit The huge Frost-Giants, sons of Örgelmir, Themselves like mountains, solitary now, Now grouped, with knees drawn up and heads low bent Plotting new wars. Those wars the Northman sang; And thunder-like rang out the vast applause. That hour Birinus whispered one close by: ‘Not casual this! Ill spirits, be sure, this day And impious men will launch their fiercest bolts To crush Christ's Faith for ever!’ Jocund songs That bard sang next: how Thor had roamed disguised Through Jötunheim, and found the giant-brood Feasting; and how their king gave challenge thus: ‘Sir, since you deign us visit, show us feats! Behold yon drinking horn! with us a child Drains it at draught.’ The God inclined his head And swelled his lips; and three times drank: yet lo! Nigh full that horn remained, the dusky mead In mockery winking! Spake once more the king: ‘Behold my youngest daughter's chief delight, Yon wild-cat grey! She lifts it: lift it thou!’ The God beneath it slipped his arm and tugged, And tugging, ever higher rose and higher; The wild cat arched her back and with him rose;— But one foot left the ground! Last, forward stept A haggard, lame, decrepid, toothless crone, And cried, ‘Canst wrestle, friend?’ He closed upon her: Firm stood she as a mountain: she in turn Closed upon Thor, and brought him to one knee: Lower she could not bend him. Thor for rage Clenched both his fists until his finger-joints Grew white as snow late fallen! Loud and long The laughter rose: the minstrel frowned dislike: ‘I have against you somewhat, Wessex men! In laughter spasms ye reel, or shout applause Music surceased. Like rocks your fathers sat; In every song they knew some mystery lay, Mystery of man or nature. Greater God Is none than Thor, whom, clamouring, thus ye flout. That Giant-King his greatness knew: at morn, While vexed at failure through the gates he passed, Addressed him reverent: “Lift thy head, great Thor! Disguised thou cam'st: not less we knew thee well: Brave battle fought'st thou, seeming still to fail: Thy foes were phantoms! Phantasies I wove To snare thine eyes because I feared thy hand, And pledged thy strength to tasks impossible. That horn thou could'st not empty was the sea! At that third draught such ebb-tide stripp'd the shore As left whole navies stranded! What to thee Wild-cat appeared was Midgard's endless snake Whose infinite circle clasps the ocean round: Then when her foot thou liftedst, tremour went From iron vale to vale of Jötunheim: Hadst thou but higher raised it one short span, The sea had drowned the land! That toothless crone Was Age, that drags the loftiest head to earth: She bent thy knee alone. Come here no more! On equal ground thou fight'st us in the light: In this, our native land, the stronger we, And mock thee by Illusions!”’ After pause, With haughty eye cast round, the minstrel spake: ‘Now hear ye mysteries of the antique song, Though few shall guess their import!’ Then he sang Legends primeval of that Northern race And dread beginnings of the heavens and earth, When, save the shapeless chaos, nothing was: Of Ymer first, by some named Örgelmir, The giant sire of all the giant brood:— Him for his sins the sons of Bör destroyed; Then fashioned of his blood the seas and streams And of his bones the mountains; of his teeth The cliffs firm set against the aggressive waves; Last, of his skull the vast, o'er-hanging heaven And of his brain the clouds. ‘Sing on,’ they cried: Next sang he of that mystic shape, earth-born, The wondrous cow, Auhumla. Herb that hour Was none, nor forest growth; yet on and on She wandered by the vapour-belted seas, And, wandering, from the stones and icebergs cold That creaked forlorn against the grey sea-crags She licked salt spray, and hoary frost, and lived; And ever where she licked sprang up, full-armed, Men fair and strong! Once more they cried ‘Sing on!’ Last sang the minstrel of the Night and Day: Car-borne they sweep successive through the heaven: First rides the dusky maid by men called Night; Sleep-bringing, pain-assuaging, kind to man; With dream-like speed cleaving the starry sphere: Hrimfaxi is her horse: his round complete Foam from his silver bit bespangles earth, And mortals call it ‘Morn.’ Day follows fast, Her brother white: Skinfaxi is his horse: When forth he flings the splendours from his mane Both Gods and men rejoice. Thus legends old The Northman sang, till, fleeting from men's eyes The present lived no longer. In its place He fixed that vision of the world new formed Which on the childhood of the Northern mind Like endless twilight lay;—spaces immense; Unmeasured energies of fire and flood; Great Nature's forces terrible yet blind In ceaseless strife alternately supreme, Or breast to breast with dreadful equipoise In conflict pressed. Once more o'er those that heard He hung that old world's low, funereal sky: Before their eyes he caused its cloud to stream Shadowing infinitude. He spake no word Like Heida of that war 'twixt Good and Ill; That peace which crowns the just; that God Unknown: Enough to him his Faith without its soul! With glorying eye he marked that panting throng; Then, sudden, changed his note. Again of war He sang, but war no more of Gods on Gods; He sang the honest wars of man on man; Of Odin, king of men, ere yet, death past, He flamed abroad in godhead. Field on field He sang his battles; traced from realm to realm His conquering pilgrimage: then ended, fierce: ‘What God was this—that God ye honoured once? What man was this—your half-forgotten king? Your law-giver he was; he framed your laws! Your poet he: he shaped your earliest song! Your teacher he: he taught you first your runes! ‘The Icelandic chronicles point out Odin as the most persuasive of men. They tell us that nothing could resist the force of his words; that he sometimes enlivened his harangues with verses, which he composed extempore; and that he was not only a great poet, but that it was he who first taught the art of poesy to the Scandinavians. He was also the inventor of the Runic characters.’—Northern Antiquities, p. 83. Mallet asserts that it was to Christianity that the Scandinavians owed the practical use of those Runes which they had possessed for centuries:—‘nor did they during so many years ever think of committing to writing those verses with which their memories were loaded; and it is probable that they only wrote down a small quantity of them at last.... Among the innumerable advantages which accrued to the Northern nations from the introduction of the Christian religion, that of teaching them to apply the knowledge of letters to useful purposes is not the least valuable. Nor could a motive less sacred have eradicated that habitual and barbarous prejudice which caused them to neglect so admirable a secret.’—P. 234. Mallet's statement respecting the Greek emigration of the Northern ‘Barbarians’ from the East is thus confirmed by Burke. ‘There is an unquestioned tradition among the Northern nations of Europe importing that all that part of the world had suffered a great and general evolution by a migration from Asiatic Tartary of a people whom they call Asers. These everywhere expelled or subdued the ancient inhabitants of the Celtick or Cimbrick original. The leader of this Asiatic army was called Odin, or Wodin; first their general, afterwards their tutelar deity.... The Saxon nation believed themselves the descendants of those conquerors.’—Burke, Abridgment of English History, book ii. cap. i. Your warrior—yours! His warfare consummate, For you he died! Old age at last, sole foe Unvanquished, found him throned in Gylfin's land: Summoning his race around him thus he spake: “My sons, I scorn that age should cumber youth! Ye have your lesson—see ye keep it well! I taught you how to conquer; how to live; Now learn to die!” His dagger high he raised; Nine times he plunged it through his bleeding breast, Then sheathed it in his heart. Ere from his lips The kingly smile had vanished he was dead!’ So sang the bard and rose: his work was done: Abroad the tempest burst. 'Twas not his songs Alone that raised it! Memories which they waked Memories of childhood, fainter year by year, Tripled his might. Meantime a Saxon priest Potential there, bent low, with eye-brow arched, O'er Eardulf's ear, Eardulf old warrior famed, And whispered long, and as he whispered glanced Oft at Birinus. Keen of eye the King The action noting well, the aim divined, And thus to Offa near him spake, low-toned: ‘The full-fed priest of Odin sends a sword To slay that naked babe he hates so sore The Faith of Christ!’ Rising with fiery face And thundering hand that shook the banquet board Eardulf began: ‘“Ye are not what ye were!” So saith our stranger kinsman from the North, A man plain-tongued; I would that all were such! Lords, and my King, this stranger speaks the truth! I tell you too, we are not what we were: Nor lengthened trail he hunts who seeks the cause. Lo, there the cause among us! Man from Rome! I ask who sent thee hither? From the first Rome and our native races stand at war; Her hope was this, to make our sons like hers Liars and slaves, our daughters false and vile, And, thus subverted, rule our land and us. Frustrate in war, now sends she forth her priests In peaceful gown to sap the manly hearts Her sword but manlier made. Ho, Wessex men! You see your foe! My counsel, Lords, is this: The worm that sting us tread we to the earth Then spurn it from our coasts!’ Ere ceased the acclaim Subdued and soft the Pagan pontiff rose, And three times half retired, as one who yields His betters place; and thrice, answering the call Advanced, and leaning stood: at last he spake Sweet-voiced, not loud; ‘Ye Wessex Earls and Thanes, I stand here but as witness not as judge; Ye are the judges. Late ye heard—yea, twice— Words strange and new; “Ye are not what ye were!” I witness this; things are not what they were; For round me as I roll these sorrowing eyes Now old and dim—perchance the fault is theirs— They find no longer, ranged along your walls Amid the deep-dyed trophies of old time, That chiefest of your Standards, lost, men say, In that ill-omened battle lost which wrecked But late our Wessex kingdom. Odin's wrath— I spare to task your time and patience, Lords, Enforcing truth which every urchin knows— 'Twas Odin shamed his foe! Ah Cynegils! What made thee Odin's foe? Our friend was he! Base tolerance first, connivance next, then worse, Favoured that Faith perfidious! Stood and stands A bow-shot hence that church the strangers built; Their church, their font! The strangers, who are they? Snake like and supple, winding on and on Through courtly chambers darkling still they creep, Nor dare to face a people front to front; Let them stand up in light and all is well! And who their converts? Late, to please a king They donned his novel worship like a robe; When dead he lay they doffed it! Earls and Thanes, A nobler day is come; a sager king; In him I trust; in you; in Odin most, Our nation's strength, the bulwark of our throne. I proffer nought of counsel. Ye have eyes: The opprobrium sits among you!’ From the floor The storm of iron feet rang loud, and swords Leaped flashing from their sheaths. In silence some Waited the event: the larger part by far Clamoured for vengeance on the outlandish Faith, The loudest they, the apostates of past time. Then stately from his seat Birinus rose, And stood in calm marmorean. Long he stood Not eager though expectant. By degrees That tumult lessening, with a quiet smile And hand extended, far commanding peace, Thus he addressed that concourse. ‘Earls and Thanes, Among so many here I stand alone, Why peaceful? why untroubled? In your hands I see a hundred swords against me bent: Sirs, should they slay me, Truth remains unpierced. A thousand wheat ears swayed by summer gust Affront one oak; it slights the mimic threat: So slight I, strong in faith, whose swords that err— Your ignorance, not your sin. The Truth of God, The Heart of man against you fight this day And, with his heart, his hope. In every land Through all the unnumbered centuries yet to come The cry of women wailing for their babes Restored through Christ alone, the cry of men Who know that all is lost if earth is all, The cry of children still unstained by sin, The sinners' cry redeemed from yoke of sin, Thunder against you. Pass to lesser themes. ‘Eardulf, that raged against me, told you, Lords, That Rome was still the hater of your race And warred thereon. She warred much more on mine Roman but Christian likewise! Ye were foes; Warring on you she warred on hostile tribes: In us she tore her proper flesh and blood: Mailed men were you that gave her blow for blow; We were her tender children; on her hearths We dwelt, or delved her fields and dressed her vines: What moved her hatred? This. We loved a God All love to man. With every God beside Rome made her traffic: fellowship with such Unclean we deemed: thenceforth Rome saw in us Her destined foe. ‘Three centuries, Earls and Thanes, Her hand was red against us. Vengeance came: Who wrought it? Who avenged our martyred Saints That, resting 'neath God's altar, cried, “How long?” Alaric, and his, the Goths! And who were they? Your blood, your bone, your spirit and your soul! They with your fathers roamed four hundred years The Teuton waste; they swam the Teuton floods, They pointed with the self-same hand of scorn At Rome, their common foe! Great Odin's sons Together came ye from the shining East: True man was he: ye changed him to false god! That Odin, when the destined hour had pealed Beckoned to Alaric, marched by Alaric's side Invisibly to Rome! ‘Ye know the tale: Her senate-kings their portals barred; they deemed That awe of Rome would drive him back amazed; And sat secure at feast. But he that slew Remus, his brother, on the unfinished wall, A bitter expiation paid that night! The wail went up: the Goths were lords of Rome! Alaric alone in that dread hour was just And with his mercy tempered justice. Why? Alaric that day was Christian: of his host The best and bravest Christian. Senators In purple nursed lived on, thenceforth in rags; To Asian galleys and Egyptian marts The rich were driven! the mighty. Gold in streams Ran molten from the Capitolian roofs: The idol statues choked old Tyber's wave: But life and household honour Alaric spared; And round the fanes of Peter and of Paul His soldiers stood on guard. Upon the grave Of that bad Empire sentenced, nay of all The Empires of this world absorbed in one In one condemned, they throned the Church of Christ; His Kingdom's seat established. ‘Since that hour That kingdom spreads o'er earth. In Eastern Gaul Long since your brave Burgundians kneel to Christ; Pannonia gave Him to the Ostro-Goths Barbaric named; and to the Suevi Spain: The Vandals o'er the Mauritanian shores Exalt His Cross with joy. Your pardon, sirs: These lands to you are names; but Odin knew them; A living man he trod them in his youth; Hated their vices; bound his race to spurn Their bait, their bond! That day he saw hath dawned; O'er half a world the vivifying airs Launched from your northern forests chaste and cold Have blown, and blow this hour! The Saxon race Alone its destiny knows not. Ye have won Here in this Isle the old Roman heritage: Perfect your victory o'er that Pagan Rome With Christian Rome partaking! ‘Earls and Thanes, But one word more. Your pontiff late averred That kings to us are gods; through them we conquer: I answer thus: That Kingdom God hath raised Is sovereign and is one; kingdoms of earth, How great soe'er, to it are provinces In spiritual things. If princes turn to God They save their souls. If kingdoms war on God Their choice is narrow, and their choice is this: To break, like that which falleth on a stone; Or else, like that whereon that stone doth fall, To crumble into dust.’ The Pagan priest Whispered again to Eardulf, ‘Praise to Thor! He flouts our king! The boaster's chance is gone!’ Then rose that king and spake in careless sort: ‘Earls and my Thanes, I came from exile late: It may be that to exile I return: Not less my arm is long; my sword is sharp: Let him that hates me fear me! ‘Earls and Thanes, I passed that exile in a Christian realm: There of the Christian greatness, Christian right, I somewhat heard, and hearing, disbelieved; Saw likewise somewhat, and believed in part: Saw more, till nigh that part had grown to whole: I saw that war itself might be a thing Though stern, yet stern in mercy; saw that peace Might wear a shape dearest to manliest heart, Peace based on fearless justice militant 'Gainst wrong alone and riot. Earls and Thanes Returned this day and in this regal hall A spectacle I saw, if grateful less, Not therefore less note-worthy—countless swords In judgment drawn against a man unarmed; Yea, and a man unarmed with brow unmoved Confronting countless swords. These things I saw; Fair sight that tells me how to act, and when; For I was minded to protract the time Which strangles oft best purpose. At the font Of Christ—it stands a bow-shot from this spot As late we learned—at daybreak I and mine Become henceforth Christ's lieges. ‘Earls and Thanes I heard but late a railer who affirmed That kings were tyrants o'er the faiths of men Flexile to please them: thus I made reply; The meanest of my subjects, like his king, Shall serve his God in freedom: if the chief Questions the equal freedom of his king That man shall die the death! Through Christian Faith— I hide not this—one danger threats the land: It threats as much, nay more my royal House: That danger must be dared since truth is truth: That danger ye shall learn to-morrow noon: Till comes that hour, farewell!’ The matin beam, God's wingèd messenger from loftier worlds, Through the deep window of the baptistery Glittered on eddies of the bath-like font Not yet quiescent since its latest guest Had thence arisen; beside its marge the king In snowy raiment stood; upon his right, Alfred, his first-born, boy of seven years old, And, close beside, in wonder not in dread, Mildrede, his sister, younger by one year, Holding her brother's hand. From either waist Flowed a white kirtle to the small snow feet With roses tinged. Above it all was bare, And with the fontal dew-drops sparkling still; While from each head with sacred unction sealed Floated the chrismal veil. That eye is blind Which sees not beauty save on female brows: On either face that hour the lustre lay; But hers was lustre passive, lustre pale; The boy's was active, daring, penetrating— Keen as the Morning Star's. With dewy eyes The strong king on them gazed, and inly mused, ‘To God I gave them up: yet ne'er till now Seemed they so wholly mine!’ Birinus spake: ‘Ye have been washed in baptism, though no sin Hath yet been yours save Adam's, and confirmed; And houselled ye shall be at Mass seven days Since Christ in infant bosoms loves to dwell. Pray, day by day, that Christ would keep you pure: Pray for your Father: likewise pray for me Old sinner soon to die.’ Then raised those babes Their baptism tapers high, and fixing eyes That moved not on their backward-fluttering flames, Led the procession to their palace home, Their father pacing last. That day at noon The monarch sat upon his royal throne Birinus near him standing: at his feet His children played; while round him silent thronged Warriors and chiefs. The king addressed them thus; ‘Birinus and the rest, I hold it meet A king should hide a secret from his foes But with his friends be open. Yestereve I, Christian now, unfalteringly avouched That in the victory of the Christian Faith, True though it be, one danger I discerned: That danger, and its root, I now divulge. Saw ye the scorn within that Northman's eye Last eve, when, praising Thor, in balance stern He weighed what now we are with what we were When first he trod our shores! He spake the truth: His race and ours are kin; but his retain Stronglier their manly virtue, frost and snow Like whetstones sharpening still that virtue's edge; We soften with the years. Beggars this day Sue us for bread! Sirs, in a famine once I saw, then young, a hundred at a time That, linking hand in hand, loud singing rushed, Like hunters chasing hart to sea-beat cliffs This is recorded by Lingard and Burke. And o'er them plunged! Now comes this Faith of Christ! That Faith to which, because that Faith is true, I pledged this morn my word, my seal, my soul, The fate and fortunes of our native land And all my royal House well knowing this The king who loves his kingdom more than God Better than both loves self—no king at heart. Now comes this Christian Faith! That Faith, be sure, Is not a hardening faith: gentle it makes: I told you, Lords, we soften day by day; I might have added that with growing years Hardness we doubly need. When Rome was great Our race, however far diffused, was one, Made one by hate of Rome. When Rome declined That bond dissolved. A second bond remained In Odin's Faith:—Northmen alone retain it. In them a new Rome rises! Earls and Thanes! The truth be ours though for that truth we die! Hold fast that truth; yet hide not what it costs. Through fog and sea-mist of the days to come I see huge navies with the raven flag Steering to milder borders Christian half, Brother 'gainst brother ranging. Kingdoms Seven Of this still fair and once heroic land I say, beware that hour! If come it must Then fall the thunder while I walk this earth Not when I skulk in crypts!’ The others mute From joy malicious some, some vexed with doubt, Birinus made reply: ‘My Lord and King Inly this day I gladden, certain now That neither fancy-drawn nor anger-spurred, Nor seeking crowns for others or thyself, Nor shunning woes the worst that earth can know For others or thyself, but urged by faith, God's greatest gift to man, thou mad'st this day Submission true to Christ. So be it, King! So rest content! God with a finger's touch Could melt that cloud which threats thy realm well-loved; That threat I deem nor trivial nor obscure Not thus He wills. Danger, distress, reverse, Are heralds sent from God like peace and joy To nations as to men. Happy that land Which worketh darkling; worketh without wage; And worketh still for God! If God desired A people for His sacrificial lamb Happiest of nations should that nation be Which died His willing victim! ‘King and Son,’ With voice a moment troubled he resumed, ‘Thy future rests with God! Yet shake, oh shake One boding brief, 'tis causeless, from thy breast, Deeming thy race less valiant than the North: Faithfuller they stand and nearer to their sires! Remorseless less to others and to self I grant them; that implies not valiant less: The brave are still in spirit the merciful; Far down within their being stirs a sense Of more than race or realm. Some claim world-wide, Whereof the prophet is the wailing babe Smites on their hearts, a cradle decks therein For Him they know not yet, the Bethlehem Babe. That claim thy fathers felt! Through Teuton woods Dead Rome's historian saw what he records, Tacitus. Moved forth of old in cyclic pilgrimage Thick-veiled, the sacred image of the Earth, All reverend Mother, crowned Humanity! Not war-steeds haled her car but oxen meek; And, as it passed oppugnant bounds, the trump Ceased from its blare; the lance, the war-axe fell; Grey foes shook hands; their children played together. Beyond the limit line of dateless wars Looked forth the vision thus of endless peace. Think'st thou that here was lack of manly heart? King, this was manhood's self!’ While thus he spake, Alfred, and Mildrede, children of the king, That long time, by that voice majestic charmed, Had turned from distant sports, upon their knees Softly and slowly to Birinus crept, Their wide eyes from his countenance moving not And so knelt on; Alfred, the star-eyed boy Supported by his father's sceptre-staff His plaything late, now clasped in hands high-held. Him with a casual eye Birinus marked At first; then stood with upward brow in trance— Sudden, as though with Pentecostal flame His whole face brightened; on him fell from God Spirit Divine; and thus the prophet cried: ‘Who speaks of danger when the Lord of all Decrees high triumph? Victory's chariot winged Up-climbs the frowning mountains of Dismay, As when above the sea's nocturnal verge Twin beams, divergent horns of orient light Announce the ascending sun. Whatever cloud Protracts the conflict victory comes at last. ‘What ho! ye sons of Odin and the North! Far off your galleys tarry! English air Reafen, your raven standard, darkened long, Woven of enchantments in the moon's eclipse: It rains its plague no more! The Kingdoms Seven Ye came to set a ravening each on each: Lo, ye have pressed and soldered them in one! ‘Behold, a Sceptre rises—not o'er Kent The first-born of the Faith; nor o'er those vales Northumbrian, trod so long by crownèd Saints; Nor Mercia's plains invincible in war: O'er Wessex, barbarous late, and waste, and small The Hand that made the worlds that Sceptre lifts; Hail tribe elect, the Judah of the Seven! ‘Piercing the darkness of an age unborn I see a King that hides his royal robe Assumes the minstrel's garb. Where meet the floods That King abides his time. I see him sweep Disguised, his harp within the Northmen's camp; In fifty fights I see him victory-crowned; I see the mighty and the proud laid low The humble lifted. God is over all. ‘The ruined cities 'mid their embers thrill: A voice went forth: they heard it. They shall rise, Their penance done, and cities worthier far With Roman vices ne'er contaminate. These shall not boast mosaic floor gem-wrought And trod by sinners. In the face of heaven Their minster turrets these shall lift on high Inviting God's great angels to descend And chaunt with them God's City here on earth. ‘Who through the lethal forest cleaves a road Healthful and fresh? Who bridges stream high-swollen? Who spreads the harvest round the poor man's cot; Sets free the slave? On justice realms are built: Who makes his kingdom great through equal laws Not based on Pagan right, but rights in Christ, First just, then free? Who from her starry gates Beckons to Heavenly Wisdom—her who played Ere worlds were shaped, before the eyes of God? Who bids her walk the peopled fields of men The reverend street with college graced and church? Who sings the latest of the Saxon songs? Who tunes to Saxon speech the Tome Divine? ‘Sing, happy land! The Isle that, prescient long Long waiting, hid her monarch in her heart, Shall look on him and cry, “My flesh, my bone, My son, my king!” To him shall Cambria bow, And Alba's self. His strength is in his God; The third part of his time he gives to prayer, And God shall hear his vows. Hail, mighty King! For aye thine England's glory! As I gaze, Methinks I see a likeness on thy brow, A likeness not to Warrior, Priest, or Chief, But Him, that child who kneels beside my feet! The sceptre comes to him who sceptre spurned; Through him it comes who sceptre clasped in sport; From Wessex's soil shall England's hope be born Two centuries hence; and Alfred is his name!’ EPILOGUE. BEDE'S LAST MAY. This narrative of the death of Bede is closely taken from a letter written by Cuthbert, a pupil of his, then residing in Jarrow, to a fellow-pupil at a distance. An English version of that letter is prefixed to Dr. Giles's translation of Bede's Ecclesiastical History. (Henry G. Bohn.) The death of Bede took place on Wednesday, May 26, A.D. 735, being Ascension Day. Bede issues forth from Jarrow, and visiting certain villagers in a wood, expounds to them the Beatitudes of our Lord. Wherever he goes he seeks records of past times, and promises in return that he will bequeath to his fellow-countrymen translations from divers Sacred Scriptures, and likewise a history of God's Church in their land. Having returned to his monastery, he dies a most happy death on the feast of the Ascension, while finishing his translation of St. John's gospel. The ending of the Book of Saxon Saints. With one lay-brother only blessed Bede In after times ‘The Venerable’ named, Passed from his convent, Jarrow. Where the Tyne Blends with the sea all beautiful it stood Bathed in the sunrise. At the mouth of Wear A second convent, Wearmouth rose. That hour The self-same matin splendour gilt them both; And in some speech of mingling lights not words Both sisters praised their God. ‘Apart, yet joined’— So mused the old man gazing on the twain: Then onward paced with head above his book Murmuring his office. Algar walked behind, A youth of twenty years with tonsured head And face, though young, forlorn. An hour had passed; They reached a craggy height; and looking back Beheld once more beyond the forest roof Those two fair convents glittering—at their feet Those two clear rivers winding! Bound by rule Again the monk addressed him to his book; Lection and psalm recited, thus he spake: ‘Why placed our holy Founder thus so near His convents? Why, albeit a single rule At last a single hand had sway o'er both, Placed them at distance? Hard it were to guess: I know but this that severance here on earth Is strangely linked with union of the heart, Union with severance. Thou hast lost, young friend, But lately lost thy boyhood's dearest mate Thine earliest friend, a brother of thy heart True Christian soul though dwelling in the world; Fear not such severance can extinguish love Here or hereafter! He whom most I loved Was severed from me by the tract of years: A child of nine years old was I when first Jarrow received me: pestilence ere long Swept from that house her monks save one alone Ceolfrid, then its abbot. Man and child We two the lonely cloisters paced; we two Together chaunted in the desolate church: I could not guess his thoughts; to him my ways Were doubtless as the ways of some sick bird Watched by a child. Not less I loved him well: Me too he somewhat loved. Beneath one roof We dwelt, and yet how severed! Save in God What know men, one of other? Here on earth, Perhaps 'tis wiser to be kind to all In large goodwill of helpful love yet free Than link to one our heart— Poor youth! that love which walks in narrow ways Is tragic love, be sure.’ With gentle face The novice spake his gratitude. Once more, His hand upon the shoulder of the youth, For now they mounted slow a bosky dell The old man spake—yet not to him—in voice Scarce louder than the murmuring pines close by; For, by his being's law he seemed, like them, At times when pensive memories in him stirred, Vocal not less than visible: ‘How great Was he, our Founder! In that ample brow What brooding weight of genius! In his eye How strangely was the pathos edged with light! How oft, his churches roaming, flashed its beam From pillar on to pillar resting long On carven imagery of flower or fruit Or deep-dyed window whence the heavenly choirs Gave joy to men below! With what a zeal He drew the cunningest craftsmen from all climes To express his thoughts in form; while yet his hand Like meanest hand among us patient toiled In garden and in bakehouse, threshed the corn Or drave the calves to milk-pail! Earthly rule Had proved to him a weight intolerable; In spiritual beauty, there and there alone Our Bennett Biscop found his native haunt, The lucent planet of his soul's repose: And yet—O wondrous might of human love— One was there, one, to whom his heart was knit, Siegfried, in all unlike him save in worth. His was plain purpose, rectitude unwarped Industry, foresight. On his friend's behalf He ruled long years those beauteous convents twain, Yet knew not they were beauteous! An abyss Severed in spirit those in heart so near: More late exterior severance came: three years In cells remote they dwelt by sickness chained: But once they met—to die. I see them still: The monks had laid them on a single bed; Weeping, they turned them later each to each: I saw the snowy tresses softly mix; I saw the faded lips draw near and meet; Thus gently interwreathed I saw them die— Strange strength of human love!’ Still walked they on: As high the sun ascended woodlands green Shivered all golden; and the old man's heart Brightened like them. His ever active mind Inquisitive took note of all it saw; And as some youth enamoured lifts a tress Of her he loves, and wonders, so the monk, Well loving Nature loved her in detail Now pleased with nestling bird, anon with flower Now noting how the beech from dewy sheath Pushed forth its silken leaflets fringed with down, Exulting next because from sprays of lime The little fledgeling leaves, like creatures winged Brake from their ruddy shells. Jesting, he cried: ‘Algar! but hear those birds! Men say they sing To fire their darkling young with gladsome news, And bid them seek the sun!’ Sadly the youth With downward front replied: ‘My friend is dead; For me to gladden were to break a troth.’ Upon the brow of Bede a shadow fell; Silent he paced, then stopped: ‘Forgive me, Algar! Old men grow hard. Yet boys and girls salute The May: like them the old must have their “maying”; This is perchance my last.’ As thus he spake They reached the summit of a grassy hill; Beneath there wound a stream upon its marge A hamlet nestling lonely in the woods: Its inmates saw the Saint and t'wards him sped Eager as birds that, when the grain is flung In fountained cloister-court of Eastern church From all sides flock with sudden rush of wings Darkening the pavement. Youths and maids came first; Their elders followed: some his garments kissed And some his hands. The venerable man Stretched forth his arms, as though to clasp them all: Above them next he signed his Master's cross; Then, while the tears ran down his aged face, Brake forth in grateful joy; ‘To God the praise! When, forty years ago, I roamed this vale A haunt it was of rapine and of wars; Now see I pleasant pastures, peaceful homes And faces peacefuller yet. That God Who walked With His disciples 'mid the sabbath fields While they the wheat-ears bruised, His sabbath keeps Within your hearts this day! His harvest ye! Once more a-hungered are His holy priests; They hunger for your souls; with reverent palms ‘But in a mystical sense the disciples pass through the cornfields when the holy Doctors look with the care of a pious solicitude upon those whom they have initiated in the Faith, and who, it is implied, are hungering for the best of all things —the salvation of men. But to pluck the ears of corn means to snatch men away from the eager desire of earthly things. And to rub with the hands is, by examples of virtue, to put from the purity of their minds the concupiscence of the flesh, as men do husks. To eat the grains is when a man, cleansed from the filth of vice by the mouths of preachers, is incorporated amongst the members of the Church.’—Bede, quoted in the Catena Aurea.—Commentary on St. Mark, cap. ii. v. 23. Daily the chaff they separate from the grain; Daily His Church within her heart conceives you, Yea, with her heavenly substance makes you one; Ye grow to be her eyes that see His truth; Her ears that hear His voice; her hands that pluck His tree of life; her feet that walk His ways. Honouring God's priests ye err not O my friends Since thus ye honour God. In Him rejoice!’ So spake he, and his gladness kindled theirs, With it their courage. One her infant brought And sued for him a blessing. One, bereaved, Cried out: ‘Your promised peace has come at last; No more I wish him back to earth!’ Again Old foes shook hands; while now, their fears forgot, Children that lately nestled at his feet Clomb to his knee. Then called from out that crowd A blind man; ‘Read once more that Book of God! For, after you had left us, many a month I, who can neither see the sun nor moon Saw oft the God-Man walking farms and fields Of that fair Eastern land!’ He spake, and lo! All those around that heard him clamoured, ‘Read!’ Then Bede, the Sacred Scriptures opening, lit Upon the ‘Sermon on the Mount,’ and read: ‘The Saviour lifted up His holy eyes On His disciples, saying, Blessed they;’ Expounding next the sense. ‘Why fixed the Lord His eyes on them that listened? Friends, His eyes Go down through all things, searching out the heart; He sees if heart be sound to hold His Word And bring forth fruit in season, or as rock Naked to bird that plucks the random seed. Friends, with the heart alone we understand; Who doth His will shall of the doctrine know If His it be indeed. When Jesus speaks Fix first your eyes upon His eyes divine There reading what He sees within your heart: If sin He sees, repent!’ With hands upheld A woman raised her voice, and cried aloud, ‘Could we but look into the eyes of Christ Nought should we see but love!’ And Bede replied: ‘From babe and suckling God shall perfect praise! Yea, from His eyes looks forth the Eternal Love, Though oft through sin of ours in sadness veiled: But when He rests them on disciples true Not on the stranger, love is love alone! O great, true hearts that love so well your Lord! That heard so trustingly His tidings good So long, by trial proved, have kept His Faith, To you He cometh—cometh with reward In heaven, and here on earth.’ With brightening face As one who flingeth largess far abroad, Once more he raised the sacred tome, and read Read loud the Eight Beatitudes of Christ; Then ceased, but later spake: ‘In ampler phrase Those Blessings ye shall hear once more rehearsed And deeplier understand them. Blessed they The poor in spirit; for to humble hearts Belongs the kingdom of their God in heaven; Blessed the meek—nor gold they boast nor power Yet theirs alone the sweetness of this earth; Blessed are they who mourn, for on their hearts The consolation of their God shall fall; Blessed are they who hunger and who thirst For righteousness; they shall be satisfied; Blessed the merciful, for unto them The God of mercy mercy shall accord; Blessed are they, the pure in heart; their eyes Shall see their God: Blessed the peacemakers; This title man shall give them—Sons of God; Blessed are they who suffer for the cause Righteous and just: a throne is theirs on high: Blessed are ye when sinners cast you forth, And brand your name with falschood for my sake; Rejoice, for great is your reward in heaven.’ Once more the venerable man made pause, Giving his Master's Blessings time to sink Through hearts of those who heard. Anon with speech Though fervent, grave, he shewed the glory and grace Of those majestic Virtues crowned by Christ While virtues praised by worldlings passed unnamed; How wondrously consentient each with each Like flowers well matched or music notes well joined: Then changed the man to deeper theme; he shewed How these high virtues, ere to man consigned, Were warmed and moulded in the God-Man's heart; Thence born, and in its sacred blood baptized. ‘What are these virtues but the life of Christ? The poor in spirit; must not they be lowly Whose God is One that stooped to wear our flesh? The meek; was He not meek Whom sinners mocked? The mourners; sent not He the Comforter? Zeal for the good; was He not militant? The merciful; He came to bring us mercy; The pure in heart; was He not virgin-born? Peacemakers; is not He the Prince of Peace? Sufferers for God; He suffered first for man. O Virtues blest by Christ, high Doctrines ye! Dread Mysteries; royal records; standards red Wrapped by the warrior King His warfare past, Around His soldiers' bosoms! Recognise, O man, that majesty in lowness hid! Put on Christ's garments. Fools shall call them rags— Heed not their scoff! A prince's child is Man, Born in the purple; but his royal robes None other are than those the Saviour dyed, Treading His Passion's wine-press all alone: Of such alone be proud!’ The old man paused; Then stretched his arms abroad, and said: ‘This day Like eight great angels making way from Heaven Each following each, those Eight Beatitudes, Missioned to earth by Him Who made the earth Have sought you out! What welcome shall be theirs?’ In silence long he stood; in silence watched, With faded cheek now flushed and widening eyes, The advance of those high tidings. As a man Who, when the sluice is cut, with beaming gaze Pursues the on-rolling flood from fall to fall, Green branch adown it swept, and showery spray Silvering the berried copse, so followed Bede The progress of those high Beatitudes Brightening, with visible beams of faith and love, That host in ampler circles, speechless some And some in passionate converse. Saddest brows Most quickly caught, that hour, the glory-touch, Reflected it the best. In such discourse Peaceful and glad the hours went by, though Bede Had sought that valley less to preach the Word Than see once more his children. Evening nigh He shared their feast; and heard with joy like theirs Their village harp; and smote that harp himself. In turn become their scholar, hour by hour Forth dragged he records of their chiefs and kings, Untangling ravelled evidence, and still Tracking traditions upwards to their source, Like him, that Halicarnassean sage, Of antique history sire. ‘I trust, my friends, To leave your sons, for lore by you bestowed Fair recompense, large measure well pressed down, Recording still God's kingdom in this land History which all may read, and gentle hearts Loving, may grow in grace. Long centuries passed If wealth should make this nation's heart too fat And things of earth obscure the things of heaven Haply such chronicle may prompt high hearts Wearied with shining nothings, back to cast Remorseful gaze through mists of time, and note That rock whence they were hewn. From youth to age Inmate of yonder convent on the Tyne, I question every pilgrim, priest, or prince, Or peasant grey, and glean from each his sheaf: Likewise the Bishops here and Abbots there Still send me deed of gift, or chronicle Or missive from the Apostolic See: Praise be to God Who fitteth for his place Not only high but mean! With wisdom's strength He filled our mitred Wilfred, born to rule; To saintly Cuthbert gave the spirit of prayer; On me, as one late born, He lays a charge Slender, yet helpful still.’ Then spake a man Burly and big, that last at banquet sat, ‘Father, is history true?’ and Bede replied; ‘The man who seeks for Truth like hidden gold, And shrinks from falsehood as a leper's touch Shall write true history; not the truth unmixed With fancies, base or high; not truth entire; Yet truth beneficent to man below. One Book there is that errs not: ye this day Have learned therefrom your Lord's Beatitudes: That book contains its histories—like them none Since written none from standing point so high, With insight so inspired, such measure just Of good and ill; high fruit of aid divine. The slothful spurn that Book; the erroneous warp: But they who read its page, or hear it read Their guide God's Spirit, and the Church of God Shall hear the voice of Truth for ever nigh, Shall see the Truth, now sunlike, and anon Like dagger-point of light from dewy grass Flashed up, a word that yet confutes a life, Pierces, perchance a nation's heart: shall see Far more—the Truth Himself in human form Walking not farms and fields of Eastern lands Alone, but these our English fields and farms; Shall see Him on the dusky mount at prayer; Shall see Him in the street and by the bier; Shall see Him at the feast, and at the grave; Now from the boat discoursing, and anon Staying the storm, or walking on its waves; Thus shall our land become a holy land And holy those who tread her!’ Lifting then Heavenward that tome, he said, ‘The Book of God! As stands God's Church, 'mid kingdoms of this world Holy alone, so stands, 'mid books, this Book! Within the “Upper Chamber” once that Church Lived in small space; to-day she fills the world: This Book which seems so narrow is a world: It is an Eden of mankind restored; It is a heavenly City lit with God: From it the Spirit and the Bride say “Come:” Blessed who reads this Book!’ Above the woods Meantime the stars shone forth; and came that hour When to the wanderer and the toiling man Repose is sweet. Upon a leaf-strewn bed The venerable man slept well that night: Next morning young and old pursued his steps As southward he departed. From a hill O'er-looking far that sea-like forest tract And many a church far-kenned through smokeless air, He blessed that kneeling concourse, adding thus ‘Pray still, O friends, for me, since spiritual foes Threat most the priesthood:—pray that holy death, Due warning given, may close a life too blest! Pray well, since I for you have laboured well, Yea, and will labour till my latest sigh; Not only seeking you in wilds and woods Year after year, but in my cell at night Changing to accents of your native tongue God's Book Divine. Farewell, my friends, farewell!’ He left them; in his heart this thought, ‘How like The great death-parting every parting seems!’ But deathless hopes were with him, and the May; His grief went by. So passed a day of Bede's; And many a studious year were stored with such; Enough but one for sample. Two glad weeks He and his comrade onward roved. At eve Convent or hamlet, known long since and loved, Gladly received them. Bede with heart as glad Renewed with them the memory of old times, Recounted benefits by him received Then strong in youth, from just men passed away, And preached his Master still with power so sweet The listeners ne'er forgat him. Evermore, Parting, he planted in the ground a cross, And bade the neighbours till their church was built Round it to pray. Meanwhile his youthful mate Changed by degrees. The ever varying scene The biting breath and balmy breast of spring And most of all that old man's valiant heart Triumphed above his sadness, fancies gay Pushing beyond it like those sunnier shoots That gild the dark vest of the vernal pine. He took account of all things as they passed; He laughed; he told his tale. With quiet joy His friend remarked that change. The second week They passed to Durham; next to Walsingham; To Gilling then; to stately Richmond soon High throned above her Ouse; to Ripon last: Then Bede made pause, and spake; ‘Not far is York; Egbert who fills Paulinus' saintly seat Would see me gladly: such was mine intent, But something in my bosom whispers, “Nay, Return to that fair river crossed by night, The Tees, the fairest in this Northern land: Beside its restless wave thine eye shall rest On vision lovelier far and more benign Than all it yet hath seen.”’ Northward once more They faced, and, three days travelling, reached at eve Again those ivied cliffs that guard the Tees: There as they stood a homeward dove, with flight Softer for contrast with that turbulent stream, Sailed through the crimson eve. ‘No sight like that!’ Thus murmured Bede; ‘ever to me it seems A Christian soul returning to its rest.’ A shade came o'er his countenance as he mused; Algar remarked that shade, though what it meant He knew not yet. The old man from that hour Seemed mirthful less, less buoyant, beaming less, Yet not less glad. At dead of night, while hung The sacred stars upon their course half way, He left his couch, and thus to Egbert wrote, Meek man—too meek—the brother of the king, With brow low bent, and onward sweeping hand, Great words, world-famed: ‘Remember thine account! The Lord's Apostles are the salt of earth; Let salt not lose its savour! Flail and fan Are given thee. Purge thou well thy threshing floor! Repel the tyrant; hurl the hireling forth; That so from thy true priests true hearts may learn True faith, true love, and nothing but the truth!’ Before the lark he rose the morrow morn, And stood by Algar's bed, and spake: ‘Arise! Playtime is past; the great, good work returns; To Jarrow speed we!’ Homeward, day by day, Thenceforth they sped with foot that lagged no more, That youth, at first so mournful, joyous now, That old man oft in thought. Next day, while eve Descended dim, and clung to Hexham's groves, He passed its abbey, silent. Wonder-struck Algar demanded, ‘Father, pass you thus That church where holy John St. John of Beverley. ordained you priest? Pass you its Bishop, Acca, long your friend? Yearly he woos your visit; tells you tales Of Hexham's saintly Wilfred; shows you still Chalice or cross new-won from distant shores: Nor these alone:—glancing from such last year A page he read you of some Pagan bard With smiles; yet ended with a sigh, and said: “Where is he now?”’ The man of God replied: ‘Desire was mine to see mine ancient friend; For that cause came I hither:—time runs short’:— Then, Algar sighing, thus he added mild, ‘Let go that theme; thy mourning time is past: Thy gladsome time is now.’ As on they walked, Later he spake: ‘It may be I was wrong; Old friends should part in hope.’ On Jarrow's towers, Bright as that sunrise while that pair went forth The sunset glittered when, their wanderings past, Bede and his comrade by the bank of Tyne Once more approached the gates. Six hundred monks Flocked forth to meet them. ‘They had grieved, I know,’ Thus spake, low-voiced, the venerable man, ‘If I had died remote. To spare that grief Before the time intended I returned.’ Sadly that comrade looked upon his face, Yet saw there nought of sadness. Silent each Advanced they till they met that cowlèd host: But three weeks later on his bed the boy Remembered well those words. Within a cell To Algar's near that later night a youth Wrote thus to one far off, his earliest friend: ‘O blessed man! was e'er a death so sweet! He sang that verse, “A dreadful thing it is To fall into the hands of God, All-Just;” Yet awe in him seemed swallowed up by love; And ofttimes with the Prophets and the Psalms He mixed glad minstrelsies of English speech, Songs to his childhood dear! ‘O blessed man! The Ascension Feast of Christ our Lord drew nigh; He watched that splendour's advent; sang its hymn: “All-glorious King, Who, triumphing this day, Into the heaven of heavens didst make ascent, Forsake us not, poor orphans! Send Thy Spirit, The Spirit of Truth, the Father's promised Gift, To comfort us, His children: Hallelujah.” And when he reached that word, “Forsake us not,” He wept—not tears of grief. With him we wept; Alternate wept; alternate read our rite; Yea, while we wept we read. So passed that day, The sufferer thanking God with labouring breath, “God scourges still the son whom He receives.” ‘Undaunted, unamazed, daily he wrought His daily task; instruction daily gave To us his scholars round him ranged, and said, “I will not have my pupils learn a lie, Nor, fruitless, toil therein when I am gone.” Full well he kept an earlier promise, made Ofttimes to humble folk, in English tongue Rendering the Gospels of the Lord. On these, The last of these, the Gospel of Saint John, He laboured till the close. The days went by, And still he toiled, and panted, and gave thanks To God with hands uplifted; yea, in sleep He made thanksgiving still. When Tuesday came Suffering increased; he said, “My time is short; How short it is I know not.” Yet we deemed He knew the time of his departure well. ‘On Wednesday morn once more he bade us write: We wrote till the third hour, and left him then To pace, in reverence of that Feast all-blest, Our cloister court with hymns. Meantime a youth, Algar by name, there was who left him never; The same that hour beside him sat and wrote: More late he questioned: “Father well-beloved, One chapter yet remaineth; have you strength To dictate more?” He answered: “I have strength; Make ready, son, thy pen, and swiftly write.” When noon had come he turned him round and said, “I have some little gifts for those I love; Call in the Brethren;” adding with a smile, “The rich man makes bequests, and why not I?” Then gifts he gave, incense or altar-cloth, To each, commanding, “Pray ye for my soul; Be strong in prayer and offering of the Mass, For ye shall see my face no more on earth: Blessed hath been my life; and time it is That unto God God's creature should return; Yea, I desire to die, and be with Christ.” Thus speaking, he rejoiced till evening's shades Darkened around us. That disciple young Once more addressed him, “Still one verse remains;” The master answered, “Write, and write with speed;” And dictated. The young man wrote; then said, “'Tis finished now.” The man of God replied: “Well say'st thou, son, ‘'tis finished.’ In thy hands Receive my head, and move it gently round, For comfort great it is, and joy in death, Thus, on this pavement of my little cell, Facing that happy spot whereon so oft In prayer I knelt, to sit once more in prayer, Thanking my Father.” “Glory,” then he sang, “To God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;” And with that latest Name upon his lips Passed to the Heavenly Kingdom.’ Thus with joy Died holy Bede upon Ascension Day In Jarrow Convent. May he pray for us, And all who read his annals of God's Church In England housed, his great bequest to man!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. V. INISFAIL A LYRICAL CHRONICLE OF IRELAND In Three Parts ‘A dirge devoutly breathed o'er sorrows past Tells also of bright calms that shall succeed.’ Wordsworth. To the Memory of THE FAITHFUL AND THE TRUE; OF THOSE AMONG THE SONS OF IRELAND WHO, DURING THE AGES OF HER AFFLICTION, SUSTAINED A JUST CAUSE IN THE SPIRIT OF LOYALTY AND LIBERTY, AND WHO SULLIED THAT CAUSE BY NO CRIME. PART I. Prologue. THE THREE WOES. That Angel whose charge is Eire sang thus o'er the dark isle winging: By a virgin his song was heard at a tempest's ruinous close: ‘Three golden ages God gave while your tender cornblade was springing: Faith's earliest harvest is reap'd. To-day God sends you Three Woes. ‘For ages three, without Laws ye shall flee as beasts in the forest: For an age, and a half age, Faith shall bring not peace but a sword: Then Laws shall rend you like eagles, sharp-fang'd, of your scourges the sorest: When these Three Woes are past, look up, for your Hope is restored. ‘The times of your dole shall be twice the time of your foregone glory: But fourfold at last shall lie the grain on your granary floor:’ The seas in vapour shall fleet, and in ashes the mountains hoary: Let God do that which He wills. Let His People endure and adore! THE WARNINGS. A.D. 1170. I In the heaven were Portents dire: On the earth were sign and omen: Bleeding stars and rain of fire Dearth and plague foreran the foemen. Causeless tremors on the crowd Fell, and strong men wept aloud: Ere the Northmen cross'd the seas Said the bards, were signs like these. II Aodh saw at break of day An oak with blood-beads on its lichen:— All its branches rushed one way, Like an army panic-stricken. Aodh cried, ‘I see a host That flees as one that flies a ghost.’ Mad he died at noon: ere night The Stranger's sails were up in sight. III Time was given us to repent: Prophets smote us, plain and city: But we scorn'd each warning sent, And outwrestled God's great pity. 'Twixt the blood-stained brother bands Mitred Laurence raised his hands, Raised Saint Patrick's cross on high: We despised him; and we die. A BARD SONG. I Our Kings sat of old in Emania and Tara: Those new kings whence come they? Their names are unknown! Our Saints lie entomb'd in Ardmagh and Killdara; Their relics are healing; their graves are grass-grown. Our princes of old, when their warfare was over, As pilgrims forth wander'd; as hermits found rest: Shall the hand of the stranger their ashes uncover In Benchor the holy, in Aran the blest? II Not so, Innumerable authorities—Irish, English, and Scotch— record that beginning of Scotch, as distinguished from Caledonian, history, the establishment of an Irish colony in Western Scotland, at that time named Alba—a colony from which that noble country derived its later name, the chief part of its population, and its Royal House, from which, through the Stuarts, our present Sovereign is descended. This settlement is recorded by the Venerable Bede. by the race our Dalriada planted! In Alba were children; we sent her a man. Battles won in Argyle in Dunedin they chanted; King Kenneth completed what Fergus began. Our name is her name: she is Alba no longer: Her kings are our blood, and she crowns them at Scone; Strong-hearted they are, and strong-handed, but stronger When throned on our Lia Fail, Destiny's stone. THE DIRGE OF THE INVADERS; OR, THE HOUSE NORMAN. Among the churches sacked and burnt by Dermod and his Norman allies, was that of the Monastery of Kells, to which the headship of the great Order of St. Columba had been transferred several centuries previously, when Iona was wasted by the Danes. The monks are here supposed to have been interrupted, while celebrating the obsequies of their slaughtered brethren, by the return of the despoilers. I The walls are black: but the floor is red! Blood!—there is blood on the convent floor! Woe to the mighty: that blood they shed: Woe, woe, de Bohun! Woe, woe, le Poer! Fitz-Walter, beware! the years are strong: De Burgh, de Burgh! God rights the wrong. Ye have murder'd priests: the hour draws nigh When your sons unshriven, without priest, shall die. II Toll for the Mighty Ones: brethren toll! They stand astonish'd! what seek they here? Through tower and through turret the winds on roll, But the yellow lights shake not around the bier. They are here unbidden!—stand back, ye proud! God shapes the empires as wind the cloud. The offence must come: but the deed is sin: Toll the death-bell: the death-psalms begin. III The happy Dead with God find rest: For them no funeral bell we toll. Fitz-Hugh! Death sits upon thy crest! De Clare! Death sits upon thy soul! Toll, monks, the death-bell; toll for them Who masque under helmet and diadem: Death's masque is Sin. The living are they Who live with God in eternal day! IV Fitz-Maurice is sentenced! Sound, monks, his knell! As Roderick fell must de Courcy fall. Toll for Fitz-Gerald the funeral bell: The blood of O'Ruark is on Lacy's wall. The lions are ye of the robber kind! But when ye lie old in your dens and blind The wolves and the jackals on you shall prey, From the same shore sent. Beware that day! V Toll for the Conquerors: theirs the doom! For the great House Norman: its bud is nipt! Ah, princely House, when your hour is come Your dirge shall be sung not in church but crypt! We mourn you in time. A baser scourge Than yours that day will forbid the dirge! Two thousand years to the Gael God gave: Four hundred shall open the Norman's grave! Thus with threne and with stern lament For their brethren dead the old monks made moan In the convent of Kells, the first day of Lent, One thousand one hundred and seventy-one. PECCATUM PECCAVIT. A BARD SONG. I Where is thy brother? Heremon, speak! Heber the son of Milesius, thy sire? The orphans' wail and the widow's shriek For ever ring on the air of Eire! And whose, O whose was the sword, Heremon, That smote Amergin, thy brother and bard?— The Fate of thy house or a mocking Demon Upheaved thy hand o'er his forehead scarr'd! II Woe, woe to Eire! That blood of brothers Wells up from her bosom renewed each year; 'Twas hers the shriek—that desolate Mother's:— 'Twas Eire that wept o'er that first red bier! The priest has warn'd, and the bard lamented: But warning and wailing her sons despised; The head was sage, and the heart half-sainted; But the sword-hand was evermore unbaptised! Between the brothers who founded the great Milesian or Gaelic dynasty in Ireland, about B.C. 760, there was strife, as between the brothers who founded Rome nearly at the same date. Heremon and Heber divided Ireland between them. A dispute having arisen between them, a battle was fought at Geashill, in the present King's County, in which Heber fell by his brother's hand. This may be called Ireland's ‘Original Sin,’ the typical fount of many woes. In the second year of his reign Heremon also slew his brother, Amergin, in battle. THE MALISON. I The Curse of that land which in ban and in blessing Hath puissance through prayer and through penance, alight On the False One who whisper'd, the Traitor's hand pressing, ‘I ride without guards in the morning—good-night!’ O beautiful serpent! O woman fiend-hearted! Wife false to O'Ruark! The story of the Irish Helen is well known. Dervorgil, the wife of O'Ruark, Prince of Breffny, fled with Dermod Mac Murrough, King of Leinster. The latter, on his deposition, went to England, where he contracted alliances with Henry II. and Strongbow against Roderick O'Connor, the last Gaelic king of all Ireland. Dervorgil ultimately found a refuge at Mellifont, where she lived in penance and works of charity. Dermod died at Ferns, under circumstances of strange horror. Exhausted by domestic discords, as well as the calamities of his country, Roderick retired to the monastery he had founded at Cong. He died there at the age of eighty-two, and was interred at Clonmacnoise, the burial-place of the Irish kings. Queen base to thy trust! The glory of ages for ever departed That hour from the isle of the saintly and just. II The Curse of that land on the princes disloyal, Who welcomed the Invader, and knelt at his knee! False Dermod, false Donald—the chieftains once royal Of the Deasies and Ossory, cursed let them be! Their name and their shame make eternal. Engrave them On the cliffs which the great billows buffet and stain: Like billows the nations, when tyrants enslave them, Swell up in their vengeance—not always in vain! III But praise in the churches and worship and honour To him who, betray'd and deserted, fought on! All praise to King Roderick, the chief of Clan-Connor, The King of all Erin, and Cathall his son! May the million-voiced chant that in endless expansion Rolls onward through heaven his praises prolong; May the heaven of heavens this night be the mansion Of the good king who died in the cloisters of Cong! THE LEGENDS. A BARD SONG. I The woods rose slowly; the clouds sail'd on; Man trod not yet the island wide: A ship drew near from the rising sun;— At the helm was the Scythian Parricide. Battles were lost and battles were won; New lakes burst open; old forests died: For ages once more in the land was none: God slew the race of the Parricide. II There is nothing that lasts save the Pine and Bard: I, Fintan the bard, was living then! Tall grows the Pine upon Slieve-Donard: It dies: in the loud harp it lives again. Give praise to the bard and a huge reward! Give praise to the bard that gives praise to men: My curse upon Aodh, the priest of Skard, Who jeers at the bard-songs of Ikerren! THE LEGENDS. A BARD SONG. I Dead is the Prince of the Silver Hand, And dead Eochy the son of Erc! Ere lived Milesius they ruled the land Thou hast ruled and lost in turn, O'Ruark! Two thousand years have pass'd since then, And clans and kingdoms in blind commotion Have butted at heaven and sunk again As great waves sink in the depths of ocean. II Last King of the Gaels of Eire, be still! What God decrees must come to pass: There is none that soundeth His way or will: His hand is iron, and earth is glass. Where built the Firbolgs shrieks the owl; The Tuatha bequeath'd but the name of Eire: Roderick, our last of kings, thy cowl Outweighs the crown of thy kingly sire! THE FAITHFUL NORMAN. I Praise to the valiant and faithful foe! Give us noble foes, not the friend who lies! We dread the drugg'd cup, not the open blow; We dread the old hate in the new disguise. To Ossory's Prince they had pledged their word: He stood in their camp, and their pledge they broke; Then Maurice the Norman upraised his sword; The Cross on its hilt he kiss'd, and spoke: II ‘So long as this sword or this arm hath might I swear by the Cross which is lord of all, By the faith and honour of noble and knight Who touches yon Prince by this hand shall fall!’ So side by side through the throng they pass'd; And Eire gave praise to the just and true. Brave foe! the Past truth heals at last: There is room in the great heart of Eire for you! SONG. I Willow-like maid with the long loose tresses, With locks like Diarba's, and fairy foot, That gatherest up from the streamlet its cresses, Above that caroller bending mute, Those tresses black in a fillet bind, Or beware of Manannan the god of the wind! II No fear of the Stranger with feet like those; No fear of the robbers that couch in the glen: But the Wind-god blows on thy cheek a rose, Then back returns to kiss it again. Manannan, they say, is the God in air— So sang the Tuatha—Bind close thy hair! III The red on her cheek was brightening still; A smile ran o'er it and made reply As she cast from the darkling and sparkling rill The flash of a darkling and sparkling eye; Then over her shoulder her long locks flung And homeward tripp'd with a mirthful song. THE LEGENDS. A BARD SONG. I They fought ere sunrise at Tor Conainn; All day they fought on the hoarse sea-shore; The sun dropp'd downward; they fought amain; The tide rose upward; they fought the more. The sands were cover'd; the sea grew red; The warriors fought in the reddening wave; That night the sea was the Sea-King's bed; The Land-King drifted by cliff and cave. II Great was the rage in those ancient days (We were pagans then) in the land of Eire; Like eagles men vanquish'd the noontide blaze; Their bones were granite; their nerves were wire. We are hinds to-day! The Nemedian kings Like elk and bison of old stalk'd forth; Their name—the ‘Sea Kings’—for ever clings To the ‘Giant Stepping Stones’ round the North. THE BARD ETHELL. THIRTEENTH CENTURY. I. I am Ethell, the son of Conn; Here I bide at the foot of the hill; I am clansman to Brian and servant to none; Whom I hated I hate; whom I loved love still. Blind am I. On milk I live, And meat (God sends it) on each Saint's Day, Though Donald Mac Art—may he never thrive— Last Shrovetide drove half my kine away! II. At the brown hill's base, by the pale blue lake, I dwell, and see the things I saw; The heron flap heavily up from the brake, The crow fly homeward with twig or straw, The wild duck, a silver line in wake, Cutting the calm mere to far Bunaw. And the things that I heard though deaf I hear; From the tower in the island the feastful cheer; The horn from the wood; the plunge of the stag, With the loud hounds after him, down from the crag. Sweet is the chase, but the battle is sweeter; More healthful, more joyous, for true men meeter! III. My hand is weak; it once was strong: My heart burns still with its ancient fire: If any man smites me he does me wrong, For I was the Bard of Brian Mac Guire. If any man slay me—not unaware, By no chance blow, nor in wine and revel, I have stored beforehand a curse in my prayer For his kith and kindred: his deed is evil. IV. There never was King, and there never will be, In battle or banquet like Malachi! The Seers his reign had predicted long; He honour'd the Bards, and gave gold for song. If rebels arose he put out their eyes; If robbers plunder'd or burn'd the fanes He hung them in chaplets, like rosaries, That others, beholding, might take more pains: There was none to women more reverent-minded, For he held his mother, and Mary, dear; If any man wrong'd them that man he blinded Or straight amerced him of hand or ear. There was none who founded more convents—none; In his palace the old and poor were fed; The orphan walked, and the widow's son, Without groom or page to his throne or bed. In council he mused, with great brows divine, And eyes like the eyes of the musing kine, Upholding a Sceptre o'er which, men said, Seven Spirits of Wisdom like fire-tongues played. He drain'd ten lakes and he built ten bridges; He bought a gold book for a thousand cows; He slew ten Princes who brake their pledges; With the bribed and the base he scorn'd to carouse. He was sweet and awful; through all his reign God gave great harvests to vale and plain; From his nurse's milk he was kind and brave: And when he went down to his well-wept grave Through the triumph of penance his soul uprose To God and the Saints. Not so his foes! V. The King that came after! ah woe, woe, woe! He doubted his friend and he trusted his foe. He bought and he sold: his kingdom old He pledged and pawn'd to avenge a spite: No Bard or prophet his birth foretold: He was guarded and warded both day and night: He counsell'd with fools and had boors at his feast; He was cruel to Christian and kind to beast: Men smiled when they talk'd of him far o'er the wave: Paid were the mourners that wept at his grave! God plagued for his sake his people sore:— They sinn'd; for the people should watch and pray That their prayers, like angels at window and door, May keep from the King the bad thought away! VI. The sun has risen: on lip and brow He greets me—I feel it—with golden wand. Ah, bright-faced Norna! I see thee now; Where first I saw thee I see thee stand! From the trellis the girl look'd down on me: Her maidens stood near: it was late in spring: The grey priests laugh'd as she cried in glee ‘Good Bard, a song in my honour sing!’ I sang her praise in a loud-voiced hymn To God who had fashion'd her, face and limb, For the praise of the clan and the land's behoof: So she flung me a flower from the trellis roof. Ere long I saw her the hill descending— O'er the lake the May morning rose moist and slow: She pray'd me (her smile with the sweet voice blending) To teach her all that a woman should know. Panting she stood: she was out of breath: The wave of her little breast was shaking: From eyes still childish and dark as death Came womanhood's dawn through a dew-cloud breaking. Norna was never long time the same: By a spirit so strong was her slight form moulded The curves swell'd out from the flower-like frame In joy; in grief to a bud she folded: As she listen'd her eyes grew bright and large Like springs rain-fed that dilate their marge. VII. So I taught her the hymn of Patrick the Apostle, And the marvels of Bridget and Columkille: Ere long she sang like the lark or the throstle, Sang the deeds of the servants of God's high Will: I told her of Brendon who found afar Another world 'neath the western star; Of our three great bishops in Lindisfarne isle; Of St. Fursey the wondrous, Fiacre without guile; Of Sedulius, hymn-maker when hymns were rare; Of Scotus the subtle who clove a hair Into sixty parts, and had marge to spare. To her brother I spake of Oisin and Fionn, And they wept at the death of great Oisin's son. The publications of the Ossianic Society have made us familiar with Fionn Mac Cumhal (the Fingal of McPherson), chief of the far-famed Irish militia, instituted in the third century to protect the kingdom from foreign invasion. Its organisation rendered it an army of extraordinary efficiency; but, existing as a separate power, it became in time as formidable to the native sovereigns as to foreigners. The terrible battle of Gavra was its ruin. In it Oscar, the son of Oisin (or Ossian), and consequently the grandson of Fionn, fell in single combat with the Irish king Carbry, and nearly his whole army perished with him, A.D. 284. To this day Fionn and Oisin are household names in those parts of Western Ireland in which the traditional Gaelic poetry is recited. I taught the heart of the boy to revel In tales of old greatness that never tire, And the virgin's, up-springing from earth's low level, To wed with heaven like the altar fire. I taught her all that a woman should know: And that none might teach her worse lore I gave her A dagger keen, and I taught her the blow That subdues the knave to discreet behaviour. A sand-stone there on my knee she set, And sharpen'd its point—I can see her yet— I held back her hair and she sharpen'd the edge While the wind piped low through the reeds and sedge. VIII. She died in the convent on Ina's height: I saw her the day that she took the veil: As slender she stood as the Paschal light, As tall and slender and bright and pale! I saw her; and dropp'd as dead: bereaven Is earth when her holy ones leave her for heaven: Her brother fell in the fight at Beigh: May they plead for me, both, on my dying day! IX. All praise to the man who brought us the Faith! 'Tis a staff by day and our pillow in death! All praise, I say, to that blessed youth Who heard in a dream from Tyrawley's strand That wail, ‘Put forth o'er the sea thy hand; In the dark we die: give us Hope and Truth!’ But Patrick built not on Iorras' shore That convent where now the Franciscans dwell: Columba was mighty in prayer and war; But the young monk preaches as loud as his bell That love must rule all and all wrongs be forgiven, Or else, he is sure, we shall reach not heaven! This doctrine I count right cruel and hard: And when I am laid in the old churchyard The habit of Francis I will not wear; Nor wear I his cord, or his cloth of hair In secret. Men dwindle: till psalm and prayer Had soften'd the land no Dane dwelt there! X. I forgive old Cathbar who sank my boat: Must I pardon Feargal who slew my son; Or the pirate, Strongbow, who burn'd Granote, They tell me, and in it nine priests, a nun, And—worst—Saint Finian's old crosier staff? At forgiveness like that I spit and laugh! My chief, in his wine-cups, forgave twelve men; And of these a dozen rebell'd again! There never was chief more brave than he! The night he was born Loch Gur up-burst: He was bard-loving, gift-making, loud of glee, The last to fly, to advance the first. He was like the top spray upon Uladh's oak, He was like the tap-root of Argial's pine: He was secret and sudden: as lightning his stroke: There was none that could fathom his hid design! He slept not: if any man scorn'd his alliance He struck the first blow for a frank defiance With that look in his face, half night half light, Like the lake gust-blacken'd yet ridged with white! There were comely wonders before he died: The eagle barked and the Banshee cried; The witch-elm wept with a blighted bud: The spray of the torrent was red with blood: The chief, return'd from the mountain's bound, Forgat to question of Bran, his hound. We knew he would die: three days were o'er; He died. We waked him for three days more. One by one, upon brow and breast The whole clan kiss'd him. In peace may he rest! XI. I sang his dirge. I could sing that time Four thousand staves of ancestral rhyme: To-day I can scarcely sing the half: Of old I was corn and now I am chaff! My song to-day is a breeze that shakes Feebly the down on the cygnet's breast: 'Twas then a billow the beach that rakes, Or a storm that buffets the mountain's crest. Whatever I bit with a venomed song Grew sick, were it beast, or tree, or man: The wrong'd one sued me to right his wrong With the flail of the Satire and fierce Ode's fan. I sang to the chieftains: each stock I traced Lest lines should grow tangled through fraud or haste. To princes I sang in a loftier tone, Of Moran the Just who refused a throne; Of Moran whose torque would close, and choke The wry-necked witness that falsely spoke. I taught them how to win love and hate, Not love from all; and to shun debate. To maids in the bower I sang of love: And of war at the feastings in bawn or grove. XII. Great is our Order; but greater far Were its pomp and power in the days of old, When the five Chief Bards in peace or war Had thirty bards each in his train enroll'd; When Ollave Fodhla in Tara's hall Fed bards and kings: when the boy, king Nial, Was train'd by Torna: when Britain and Gaul Sent crowns of laurel to Dallan Forgial. To-day we can launch the clans into fight: That day we could freeze them in mid career! Whatever man knows was our realm by right: The lore without music no Gael would hear. Old Cormac, the brave blind king, was bard Ere fame rose yet of O'Daly and Ward. The son of Milesius was bard—‘Go back, My People,’ he sang; ‘ye have done a wrong! Nine waves go back o'er the green sea track; Let your foes their castles and coasts make strong. To the island ye came by stealth and at night: She is ours if we win her in all men's sight!’ For that first song's sake let our bards hold fast To Truth and Justice from first to last! 'Tis over! some think we err'd through pride, Though Columba the vengeance turned aside. Too strong we were not: too rich we were: Give wealth to knaves:—'tis the true man's snare! XIII. But now men lie: they are just no more: They forsake the old ways: they quest for new: They pry and they snuff after strange false lore As dogs hunt vermin! It never was true:— I have scorn'd it for twenty years—this babble That eastward and southward a Saxon rabble Have won great battles, and rule large lands, And plight with daughters of ours their hands! We know the bold Norman o'erset their throne Long since! Our lands! Let them guard their own! XIV. How long He leaves me—the great God—here! Have I sinn'd some sin, or has God forgotten? This year I think is my hundredth year: I am like a bad apple, unripe yet rotten! They shall lift me ere long, they shall lay me—the clan— By the strength of men on mount Cruachan! God has much to think of! How much he hath seen And how much is gone by that once hath been! On sandy hills where the rabbits burrow Are Raths of Kings men name not now: On mountain tops I have tracked the furrow And found in forests the buried plough. For one now living the strong land then Gave kindly food and raiment to ten. No doubt they wax'd proud and their God defied; So their harvest He blighted or burned their hoard; Or He sent them plague, or He sent the sword: Or He sent them lightning; and so they died Like Dathi, the king, on the dark Alp's side. XV. Ah me that man who is made of dust Should have pride toward God! 'Tis a demon's spleen! I have often fear'd lest God, the All-just, Should bend from heaven and sweep earth clean, Should sweep us all into corners and holes, Like dust of the house-floor, both bodies and souls! I have often fear'd He would send some wind In wrath; and the nation wake up stone-blind. In age or in youth we have all wrought ill: I say not our great king Nial did well, Although he was Lord of the Pledges Nine When, beside subduing this land of Eire, He raised in Armorica banner and sign, And wasted the British coast with fire. Perhaps in His mercy the Lord will say, ‘These men! God's help! 'Twas a rough boy play!’ He is certain—that young Franciscan Priest— God sees great sin where men see least: Yet this were to give unto God the eye Unmeet the thought, of the humming fly! I trust there are small things He scorns to see In the lowly who cry to Him piteously. Our hope is Christ. I have wept full oft He came not to Eire in Oisin's time; Though love, and those new monks, would make men soft If they were not harden'd by war and rhyme. I have done my part: my end draws nigh: I shall leave old Eire with a smile and sigh: She will miss not me as I miss'd my son: Yet for her, and her praise, were my best deeds done. Man's deeds! man's deeds! they are shades that fleet, Or ripples like those that break at my feet. The deeds of my chief and the deeds of my King Grow hazy, far seen, like the hills in spring. Nothing is great save the death on the Cross! But Pilate and Herod I hate, and know Had Fionn lived then he had laid them low Though the world thereby had sustain'd great loss. My blindness and deafness and aching back With meekness I bear for that suffering's sake; And the Lent-fast for Mary's sake I love, And the honour of Him, the Man above! My songs are all over now:—so best! They are laid in the heavenly Singer's breast Who never sings but a star is born: May we hear His song in the endless morn! I give glory to God for our battles won By wood or river, on bay or creek; For Norna—who died; for my father, Conn: For feasts, and the chase on the mountains bleak: I bewail my sins, both unknown and known, And of those I have injured forgiveness seek. The men that were wicked to me and mine;— (Not quenching a wrong, nor in war nor wine) I forgive and absolve them all, save three: May Christ in His mercy be kind to me! KING MALACHI. A BARD SONG. I 'Twas a holy time when the Kings, long foemen, Fought, side by side, to uplift the serf; Never triumph'd in old time Greek or Roman As Brian and Malachi at Clontarf. There was peace in Eire for long years after Canute in England reign'd and Sweyn; But Eire found rest, and the freeman's laughter Rang out the knell of the vanquished Dane. II Praise to the King of eighty years Who rode round the battle-field, cross in hand! But the blessing of Eire and grateful tears To the King who fought under Brian's command! A crown in heaven for the King who brake, To staunch old discords, his royal wand: Who spurned his throne for his People's sake, Who served a rival and saved the land! SAINT PATRICK AND THE KNIGHT; OR, THE INAUGURATION OF IRISH CHIVALRY. I ‘Thou shalt not be a Priest,’ he said; ‘Christ hath for thee a lowlier task: Be thou His soldier! Wear with dread His Cross upon thy shield and casque! Put on God's armour, faithful knight! Mercy with justice, love with law; Nor e'er except for truth and right This sword, cross-hilted, dare to draw.’ II He spake, and with his crosier pointed Graved on the broad shield's brazen boss (That hour baptised, confirmed, anointed Stood Erin's chivalry) the Cross; And there was heard a whisper low— Saint Michael, was that whisper thine? ‘Thou Sword, keep pure thy virgin vow, And trenchant shalt thou be as mine.’ THE BALLAD OF THE BIER THAT CONQUERED; OR, O'DONNELL'S ANSWER. A.D. 1257. Maurice Fitz Gerald, Lord Justice, marched to the north-west, and a furious battle was fought between him and Godfrey O'Donnell, Prince of Tirconnell, at Creadran-Killa, north of Sligo, A.D. 1257. The two leaders met in single combat, and severely wounded each other. It was of the wound he then received that O'Donnell died, after triumphantly defeating his great rival in Ulster, O'Neill. The latter, hearing that O'Donnell was dying, demanded hostages from the Kinel Connell. The messengers who brought this insolent message fled in terror the moment they had delivered it;—and the answer to it was brought by O'Donnell on his bier. Maurice Fitz Gerald finally retired to the Franciscan monastery which he had founded at Youghal, and died peacefully in the habit of that Order. Land which the Norman would make his own! (Thus sang the Bard 'mid a host o'erthrown, While their white cheeks some on the clench'd hand propp'd, And from some the life-blood unheeded dropp'd) There are men in thee that refuse to die, Though they scorn to live, while a foe stands nigh! I. O'Donnell lay sick with a grievous wound: The leech had left him; the priest had come; The clan sat weeping upon the ground, Their banners furl'd, and their minstrels dumb. II. Then spake O'Donnell, the King: ‘Although My hour draws nigh, and my dolours grow; And although my sins I have now confess'd, And desire in the Land, my charge, to rest, Yet leave this realm, nor will I nor can While a stranger treads on her, child or man. III. I will languish no longer a sick King here: My bed is grievous; build up my Bier. The white robe a King wears over me throw; Bear me forth to the field where he camps—your foe, With the yellow torches and dirges low. The heralds have brought his challenge and fled; The answer they bore not I bear instead: My People shall fight, my pain in sight, And I shall sleep well when their wrong stands right.’ IV. Then the clan rose up from the ground, and gave ear, And they fell'd great oak-trees and built a Bier; Its plumes from the eagle's wings were shed, And the wine-black samite above it spread Inwov'n with sad emblems and texts divine, And the braided bud of Tirconnell's pine, And all that is meet for the great and brave When past are the measured years God gave, And a voice cries ‘Come’ from the waiting grave. V. When the Bier was ready they laid him thereon; And the army forth bore him with wail and moan: With wail by the sea-lakes and rock-abysses; With moan through the vapour-trail'd wildernesses; And men sore wounded themselves drew nigh And said, ‘We will go with our King and die;’ And women wept as the pomp pass'd by. The yellow torches far off were seen; No war-note peal'd through the gorges green; But the black pines echo'd the mourners' keen. VI. What said the Invader, that pomp in sight? ‘They sue for the pity they shall not win.’ But the sick King sat on the Bier upright, And said, ‘So well! I shall sleep to-night:— Rest here my couch, and my peace begin.’ VII. Then the war-cry sounded—‘Lamb-dearg Aboo!’ And the whole clan rushed to the battle plain: They were thrice driven back, but they closed anew That an end might come to their King's great pain. 'Twas a nation, not army, that onward rush'd, 'Twas a nation's blood from their wounds that gush'd: Bare-bosom'd they fought, and with joy were slain; Till evening their blood fell fast like rain; But a shout swell'd up o'er the setting sun, And O'Donnell died, for the field was won. So they buried their King upon Aileach's shore; And in peace he slept;—O'Donnell More. THE DIRGE OF ATHUNREE A.D. 1316. I. Athunree! Athunree! Erin's crown, it fell on thee! Ne'er till then in all its woe Did her heart its hope forego. Save a little child—but one— The latest regal race is gone. Roderick died again on thee, Athunree! II. Athunree! Athunree! A hundred years and forty-three Winter-wing'd and black as night O'er the land had track'd their flight: In Clonmacnoise from earthy bed Roderick raised once more his head:— Fedlim floodlike rushed to thee, Athunree! III. Athunree! Athunree! The light that struggled sank on thee! Ne'er since Cathall the red-handed Such a host till then was banded. Long-haired Kerne and Galloglass Met the Norman face to face; The saffron standard floated far O'er the on-rolling wave of war; Bards the onset sang on thee, Athunree! IV. Athunree! Athunree! The poison tree took root in thee! What might naked breasts avail 'Gainst sharp spear and steel-ribbed mail? Of our Princes twenty-nine Bulwarks fair of Connor's line, Of our clansmen thousands ten Slept on thy red ridges. Then— Then the night came down on thee, Athunree! V. Athunree! Athunree! Strangely shone that moon on thee! Like the lamp of them that tread Staggering o'er the heaps of dead, Seeking that they fear to see. O that widows' wailing sore! On it rang to Oranmore; Died, they say, among the piles That make holy Aran's isles;— It was Erin wept on thee, Athunree! VI. Athunree! Athunree! The sword of Erin brake on thee! Thrice a hundred wounded men, Slowly nursed in wood or glen, When the tidings came of thee Rushed in madness to the sea; Hurled their swords into the waves, Raving died in ocean caves:— Would that they had died on thee, Athunree! VII. Athunree! Athunree! The heart of Erin burst on thee! Since that hour some unseen hand On her forehead stamps the brand: Her children ate that hour the fruit That slays manhood at the root; Our warriors are not what they were; Our maids no more are blithe and fair; Truth and Honour died with thee, Athunree! VIII. Athunree! Athunree! Never harvest wave o'er thee! Never sweetly-breathing kine Pant o'er golden meads of thine! Barren be thou as the tomb; May the night-bird haunt thy gloom And the wailer from the sea, Athunree! IX. Athunree! Athunree! All my heart is sore for thee; It was Erin died on thee, Athunree! THE DIRGE OF EDWARD BRUCE. A.D. 1318. I He is dead, dead, dead! The man to Erin dear! The King who gave our Isle a head— His kingdom is his bier. He rode into our war; And we crown'd him chief and prince For his race to Alba's shore Sailed from Erin, ages since. Woe, woe, woe! Edward Bruce is cold to-day; He that slew him lies as low, Sword to sword and clay to clay. II King Robert came too late! Long, long may Erin mourn! Famine's rage and dreadful Fate Forbade her Bannockburn! As the galley touch'd the strand Came the messenger of woe; The King put back the herald's hand: ‘Peace,’ he said, ‘thy tale I know! His face was in the cloud; And his wraith was on the surge.’— Maids of Alba, weave his shroud! Maids of Erin, sing his dirge! THE TRUE KING. A BARD SONG. A.D. 1399. I He came in the night on a false pretence; As a friend he came; as a lord remains: His coming we noted not; when, or whence; We slept: we woke in chains. Ere a year they had chased us to dens and caves; Our streets and our churches lay drown'd in blood; The race that had sold us their sons as slaves In our Land as conquerors stood! II Who were they, those princes that gave away What was theirs to keep, not theirs to give? A king holds sway for a passing day; The kingdoms for ever live! The Tanist succeeds when the King is dust: The King rules all; yet the King hath nought: They were traitors not Kings who sold their trust; They were traitors not Kings who bought! III Brave Art Mac Murrough!—Arise, 'tis morn! For a true King the nation waited long, He is strong as the horn of the unicorn, This true King who rights our wrong! He rules in the fight by an inward right; From the heart of the nation her king is grown; He rules by right; he is might of her might; Her flesh, and bone of her bone! THE BALLAD OF QUEEN MARGARET'S FEASTING. A.D. 1451. The Irish chronicler thus concludes: ‘God's blessing, the blessing of all the Saints, and of every one, blessing from Jerusalem to Inis Glaaire, be on her going to heaven; and blessed be he who will reade and heare this for blessing her Soul; and cursed be that sore in her breast that killed Margaret.’ I Fair she stood—God's queenly creature! Wondrous joy was in her face; Of her ladies none in stature Like to her, and none in grace. On the church-roof stood they round her, Cloth of gold was her attire; They in jewell'd circle wound her;— Beside her Ely's King, her sire. II Far and near the green fields glitter'd Like to flowery meads in Spring, Gay with companies loose-scatter'd Ranged each in seemly ring Under banners red or yellow: There all day the feast they kept From chill dawn and noontide mellow Till the hill-shades eastward crept. III On a white steed at the gateway Margaret's husband, Calwagh, sate: Guest on guest, approaching, straightway Welcomed he with love and state. Each pass'd on with largess laden: Chosen gifts of thought and work, Now the red cloak of the maiden, Now the minstrel's golden torque. IV On the wind the tapestries shifted; From the blue hills rang the horn; Slowly toward the sunset drifted Choral song and shout breeze-borne. Like a sea the crowds unresting Murmur'd round the grey church-tower; Many a prayer amid the feasting, For Margaret's mother rose that hour! V On the church-roof kerne and noble At her bright face look'd, half-dazed; Nought was hers of shame or trouble; On the crowds far off she gazed: Once, on heaven her dark eyes bending, Her hands in prayer she flung apart: Unconsciously her arms extending She bless'd her People in her heart. VI Thus a Gaelic queen and nation At Imayn till set of sun Kept with feast the Annunciation, Fourteen hundred fifty-one. Time it was of solace tender;— 'Twas a brave time, strong yet fair! Blessing, O ye Angels, send her From Salem's towers and Inisglaaire! THE WEDDING OF THE CLANS. A GIRL'S BABBLE. I go to knit two clans together; Our clan and this clan unseen of yore: Our clan fears nought! but I go, O whither? This day I go from my Mother's door. Thou redbreast sing'st the old song over Though many a time thou hast sung it before; They never sent thee to some strange new lover:— I sing a new song by my Mother's door. I stepp'd from my little room down by the ladder, The ladder that never so shook before; I was sad last night: to-day I am sadder Because I go from my Mother's door. The last snow melts upon bush and bramble; The gold bars shine on the forest's floor; Shake not, thou leaf! it is I must tremble Because I go from my Mother's door. From a Spanish sailor a dagger I bought me; I trail'd a rose-tree our grey bawn o'er; The creed and my letters our old bard taught me; My days were sweet by my Mother's door. My little white goat that with raised feet huggest The oak stock, thy horns in the ivies frore, Could I wrestle like thee—how the wreaths thou tuggest!— I never would move from my Mother's door. O weep no longer, my nurse and Mother! My foster-sister, weep not so sore! You cannot come with me, Ir, my brother; Alone I go from my Mother's door. Farewell, my wolf-hound, that slew Mac Owing As he caught me and far through the thickets bore: My heifer, Alb, in the green vale lowing, My cygnet's nest upon Lorna's shore! He has killed ten chiefs, this chief that plights me; His hand is like that of the giant Balor: But I fear his kiss; and his beard affrights me, And the great stone dragon above his door. Had I daughters nine with me they should tarry; They should sing old songs; they should dance at my door; They should grind at the quern;—no need to marry! O when will this marriage-day be o'er? THE IRISH NORMAN; OR, ‘LAMENT FOR THE BARON OF LOUGHMOE.’ The name of an Irish air. I Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? Not the corded brethren hooded With the earth-hued cloak and cowl:— 'Mid the black church mourner-crowded While the night winds round it howl Let them, in the chancel kneeling, Lift the hymns to God appealing: Let them scare the Powers of Evil, Striking dumb the accusing devil: Let them angel-fence the Soul That flies forward to its goal: Prayer can quicken: fire can purge: Yet they shall not sing his dirge! II Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? Not the ceremonial weepers Blackening o'er the place of tombs: Though their cry might wake the sleepers In the dark that wait their dooms; Though their dreadful ululation Sounds the death-note of a nation; Though the far-off listeners shiver Wave-tossed seamen, weary reapers Shiver like to funeral plumes, While the long wail like a river Rolls beyond the horizon's verge; Yet they shall not sing his dirge! III Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? Not the minstrels of his presence, Harpers of his halls and towers: Let them, 'mid the bowery pleasance, Sing that flower among the flowers, Female beauty:—swift its race is As the smiles on infant faces! O, ye conquering years and hours! Children that together played Love and wed, and then are laid Grey-haired beneath the yew-tree bowers, Passing gleams in glooms that merge; Yet they shall not sing his dirge! IV Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? Sing it castles that he wasted Like those old oaks thunder-blasted, Wasted with the sword or fire! Sternness God with sweetness mateth; Next to him that well createth Is the just and brave Destroyer! The man that sinned, the same must fall, Though Peter by him stood and Paul! They his clansmen, they his gleemen, They that wear the garb of freemen Wore the sackcloth, wore the serge:— Let them sing the Baron's dirge. V Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? Whoso fain would sing it faileth, Triumph so o'er grief prevaileth! Double-fountained was his blood, A Gaelic spring, a Norman flood! To his bosom truth he folded With a youthful lover's zeal: God's great Justice seemed he, moulded In a statued shape of steel! Men were liars; kerne and noble; He consumed them like to stubble! The orphan's shield, the traitor's scourge— Sing, fierce winds, the Baron's dirge! VI Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? O thou dread Almighty Will! Man exulteth; woman plaineth; But the Will Supreme ordaineth, And the years its fate fulfil. All our reason is unreason; All our glory ends in woe: Thou didst raise him for a season, Thou once more hast laid him low! But his strong life sought Thee ever; Sought Thee like a mountain river Lost at last in the sea surge— No! we will not sing his dirge! VII Who shall sing the Baron's dirge? 'Twas no time of sobs or sighing: Grave, yet glad, he lay a dying. Heralds through the vales were sent Bidding all men pray for grace That he rightly might repent Sins of his and all his race: Well he worked: three days his spirit Throve in prayer and waxed in merit. The blessed lights aloft were raised: On the Cross his dim eyes gazed To the last breath's ebb and gurge— No! for him we chant no dirge! THE STATUTE OF KILKENNY. The Statute of Kilkenny, passed A.D. 1362, is thus described by an English historian, Mr. Plowden:—‘It was enacted that intermarriages with the natives, or any connection with them as fosterers, or in the way of gossiprcd, should be punished as high treason; that the use of their name, language, apparel, or customs should be punished with the forfeiture of lands and tenements; that to submit to be governed by the Brehon Laws was treason; that the English should not make war upon the natives without the permission and authority of Government; that the English should not permit the Irish to graze upon their lands; that they should not admit them to any benefice or religious privilege, or even entertain their bards.’ Of old ye warr'd on men: to-day On women and on babes ye war; The noble's child his head must lay Beneath the peasant's roof no more! I saw in sleep the infant's hand His foster-brother's fiercely grasp; His warm arm, lithe as willow wand, Twines me each day with closer clasp! O infant smiler! grief-beguiler! Between the oppressor and the oppress'd O soft, unconscious reconciler, Smile on! through thee the Land is bless'd. Through thee the puissant love the poor; His conqueror's hope the vanquish'd shares: For thy sake by a lowly door The clan made vassal stops and stares. Our vales are healthy. On thy cheek There dawns each day a livelier red: Smile on! Before another week Thy feet our earthen floor will tread! Thy foster-brothers twain for thee Would face the wolves on snowy fell: Smile on! the ‘Irish Enemy’ Will fence their Norman nursling well. The nursling as the child is dear; Thy Mother loves not like thy nurse! That babbling Mandate steps not near Thy cot but o'er her bleeding corse! THE DAYS OF OUTLAWRY. I A cry comes up from wood and wold, A wail from fen and marish, ‘Grant us our Laws, and take our gold; Like beasts dog-chased we perish.’— The hunters of their kind reply, ‘Our sports we scorn to barter; We rule! the Irish Enemy Partakes not England's charter.’ II A cry comes up for ever new A wail of hopeless anguish, ‘Your Laws, your Laws!—our Laws ye slew; In living death we languish.’— ‘Not so! We keep our hunting-ground; We chase the flying quarry. Hark, hark, that sound! the horn and hound! Away! we may not tarry!’ III Sad isle, thy laws are Norman lords In the reign of Edward I. those Irish who lay contiguous to the county lands, finding themselves in a position of utter outlawry, the ancient Brehon Law of Ireland not being recognised by England, and English law not being extended to them, applied to the king for the protection of the latter. The incident is thus narrated by Plowden in his ‘History of Ireland’:— ‘They consequently offered, through Ufford, the chief governor, 8,000 marks to the king, provided he would grant the free enjoyment of the laws of England to the whole body of Irish natives indiscriminately.’ Edward was disposed to accept the offer, but in the words of Plowden:—‘These politic and benevolent intentions of Edward were thwarted by his servants, who, to forward their own rapacious views of extortion and oppression, prevented a convention of the king's barons and other subjects in Ireland. . . The cry of oppression was not silenced; the application of the Irish was renewed, and the king repeatedly solicited to accept them as free and faithful subjects.’ That, dower'd by Henry's bounty, On cities sup 'mid famish'd hordes, And dine on half a county! A laughing giant, Outlawry, Strides drunk o'er hill and heather; Justice to him is as a fly 'Twixt mail'd hands clash'd together. IV O memory, memory, leave the graves Knee-deep in grass and darnel! Wash from a kingdom, winds and waves, The odour of the charnel! Be dumb, red graves in valleys deep, Black towers on plains blood-sloken:— Dark fields, your thrilling secrets keep, Nor speak till God hath spoken! THE THREE CHOIRS; OR, THE CONSECRATION OF ST. PATRICK. A BARD SONG. While holy hands on Patrick laid The great Priest consecrated, Three mystic choirs—so sang the bards— Their anthems matched and mated; The first, that Roman choir which chants O'er tombs of Paul and Peter; The next a Seraph band, with note By distance rendered sweeter. The third rang out from Fochlut's wood Where once their ululation Lost Erin's babes to Patrick raised— ‘Redeem a wildered nation!’ Ring out once more, from Erin's shore! From Rome, from Heaven, for ever Roll on thou triple Psalm, that God May answer and deliver! THE BALLAD OF TURGESIUS THE DANE; OR, THE GIRL DELIVERER. A BARD SONG. The people sat amid the dust and wept: ‘In darker days than these God burst the chain,’ Thus sang the harper as the chords he swept, ‘Hear of the Girl Deliverer and the Dane.’ PART I. Twin ivy wreaths her forehead wound, A green wreath and a yellow: Her hair a gleaming dusk in ground With ends of sunshine mellow. Fair rose her head the tall neck o'er; That neck in snows was bedded: Some crown, they swore, unseen she bore— That queenly head it steadied. Her sable vest in front was laced With laces red as coral; Her golden zone in gems was traced With leafy type and moral. As treading hearts her small feet went In love-suspended fleetness: And hearts thus trodden forth had sent An organ-sob of sweetness. Upon the dais when she stept Meath's peopled hall rang loudly; Their hundred harps the minstrels swept: Her sire looked round him proudly. The Dane beside him, darkening, sate, At once his guest and victor; Green Erin's scourge—the true King's fate— The sceptred serf's protector. ‘Sir King! our worship grows but small! Here Gaels alone find honour: A white girl cannot cross your hall But all men gaze upon her! ‘My speech is short: yon stands my fort! Ere three nights thither send her With twenty maidens of her court, Your fairest, to attend her.’ PART II. The Dane strides o'er his stony floor A strong, fierce man, yet hoary: The low sun fires the purple moor With mingled gloom and glory. The tyrant stops; he stares thereon: Sun-touched, his armour flashes: His rough grey hair a glow hath won Like embers seen through ashes. His mail'd hand grasps his tangled beard: He laughs that red sun watching, Till the roofs laugh back like a forest weird The laughter of Wood-gods catching. ‘My Sea-Kings! mark yon furnace-sheen! The Fire-god is not thrifty! No flame like that these eyes have seen For winters five-and-fifty. ‘My sire lay dead: the ship sailed North, The pyre and the corse on bearing: Six miles it sailed; the flames sprang forth Like sea-vext Hecla glaring! ‘We'll pledge him to-night in the blood-red wine: 'Tis wrought, the task he set me! From coast to coast this Isle is mine: Not soon will her sons forget me! ‘I have burned their shrines and their cities sacked; Their Fair Ones our castles cumber; We were shamed to-night if the bevy lacked The fairest from their number. ‘Young wives for us all; too many by half! Strange mates—the hind with the dragon!’ He laughed as when the reveller's laugh Rings back from the half-drained flagon. PART III. The girl hath prayed at her Mother's grave, And kissed that grave, and risen: She hath swathed a knife in a silken glaive: She is calm, but her great eyes glisten. Between silk vest and spotless breast A dagger she hath hidden; With lips compressed gone forth, a guest Unhonoured—not unbidden. Through moonshine wan on moves she, on: But who are those, the others? They are garbed like maids, but maids are none: They are lovers of maids, and brothers. The gates lie wide: they enter in: Loud roars the riot and wassail: They hear at times 'mid the conquerors' din The harp of the Gaelic vassal. The Dane has laid on her head his hand, The love in his eye is cruel: Out leap the swords of that well-masked band: Two nations have met in duel! 'Twas God their sentence on high that wrote! 'Tis a righteous doom—that slaughter! His Sea-Kings lie drowned in the castle moat, And the Tyrant in Annin water. From mountain to mountain the tidings flashed: It pealed from turret to turret: Like a sunlit storm o'er the plains it dashed: It hung o'er the vales like a spirit. 'Twas a maiden's honour that crowned the right: 'Twas a vestal claim, scarce noted By the power which trampled it out of sight, That rose on the wrong, and smote it! The harper ceased: aloud the young men cried, ‘That maid is Erin! Live, O maid, for ever!’ ‘Not Erin but her Faith,’ the old priests replied: ‘Her Faith—that only—shall the Land deliver!’ EPILOGUE. At my casement I sat by night, while the wind remote in dark valleys Voluminous gather'd and grew, and waxing swell'd to a gale: Now mourning. like seas heart-grieved, now sobbing in petulant sallies: Far off, 'twas a People's moan; hard by, but a widow's wail. To God there is fragment none: nothing single; no isolation: The ages to Him are one: round Him the Woe, and the Wrong Roll like a spiritual star, and the cry of the desolate Nation: The Souls that are under the Altar respond in music ‘How long?’ By the casement I sat alone till sign after sign had descended: The Hyads rejoin'd their sea, and the Pleiads by fate were down borne: And then with that distant dirge a tenderer anthem was blended, And, glad to behold her young, the bird gave thanks to the morn. PART II. The Wars of Religion. Prologue. ‘CAN THESE BONES LIVE?’ A voice from the midnoon call'd, ‘Arise, be alone, and remove thee; Descend into valleys of bale, and look on the visions of night; From the stranger flee, and be strange to the men and the women that love thee That thy wine may be tears, and that ashes may mix with the meats of delight. To few is the Vision shown, and to none for his weal or from merit: As lepers they live who see it; as those that men pity or hate: And to few is the Voice reveal'd; yet to them who hear and can bear it Though bitterness cometh at first, yet sweetness cometh more late.’ Then in vision I saw a Corse—death-cold; but the Angels had draped it In light; and that light divine round the unseal'd death-cave was strewn; And an anthem rush'd o'er the worlds; but the tongue that moulded and shaped it Was a great storm through ruins borne; and the lips that spake it were stone. PLORANS PLORAVIT. A.D. 1583. She sits alone on the cold grave-stone And only the dead are nigh her; In the tongue of the Gael she makes her wail: The night wind rushes by her. ‘Few, O few are the leal and true, And fewer shall be, and fewer; The land is a corse; no life, no force: O wind with sere leaves strew her! ‘Men ask what scope is left for hope To one who has known her story:— I trust her dead! Their graves are red; But their Souls are with God in glory.’ ROISIN DUBH; Roisin Dubh signifies the ‘Black little Rose.’ It is well known to the Irish reader through the poem written in Queen Elizabeth's reign by the Bard of Red Hugh, Prince of Tirconnel. OR, THE BLEEDING HEART. I. O who art thou with that queenly brow And uncrown'd head? And why is the vest that binds thy breast, O'er the heart, blood-red? Like a rose-bud in June was that spot at noon, A rose-bud weak; But it deepens and grows like a July rose: Death-pale thy cheek! II. ‘The babes I fed at my foot lay dead; I saw them die: In Ramah a blast went wailing past; It was Rachel's cry. But I stand sublime on the shores of Time And I pour mine ode As Miriam sang to the cymbals' clang On the wind to God. III. O sweet, men say, is the song by day, And the feast by night; But on poisons I thrive, and in death survive Through ghostly might.’ THE DIRGE OF DESMOND. Rush, dark Dirge, o'er hills of Erin! Woe for Desmond's name and race! Loving Conqueror whom the Conquered caught so soon to her embrace: There's a veil on Erin's forehead: cold at last is Desmond's hand:— Halls that roofed her outlawed Prelates blacken like a blackening brand. Strongbow's sons forsook their Strong One, served so long with loving awe; Roche the Norman, Norman Barry, and the Baron of Lixnaw: Gaelic lords—that once were Princes—holp not—Thomond or Clancar: Ormond, ill-crowned Tudor's kinsman, ranged her hosts, and led her war. One by one his brothers perished: Fate down dragged them to their grave: Smerwick's cliffs beheld his Spaniards wrestling with the yeasty wave. Slain the herds, and burned the harvests, vale and plain with corpses strown, 'Mid the waste they spread their feast; within the charnel reigned—alone. In the death-hunt she was nigh him; she that scorned to leave his side: By her Lord she stood and spake not, neck-deep in the freezing tide: Round them waved the osiers; o'er them drooped the willows, rank on rank: Troopers spurred; and bayed the bloodhounds, up and down the bleeding bank. From the East sea to the West sea rings the deathkeen long and sore: Erin's Curse be his that led them to the hovel, burst the door! O'er the embers dead an old man silent bent with head to knee: Slowly rose he: backward fell they:—‘Seek ye Desmond? I am he.’ London Bridge! thy central archway props that grey head year by year: But to God that head is holy; and to Erin it is dear: When that bridge is dust, that river in the last firejudgment dried, The man shall live who fought for God; the man who for his country died. WAR-SONG OF MAC CARTHY. I Two lives of an eagle, the old song saith, Make the life of a black yew-tree; For two lives of a yew-tree the furrow's path Endures on the grassy lea: Two furrows shall last till the time is past God willeth the world to be; For a furrow's time has Mac Carthy stood fast Mac Carthy in Carbery. II Up with the banner whose green shall live While lives the green on the oak! And down with the axes that grind and rive Keen-edged as the thunder-stroke! And on with the battle-cry known of old And the clan-rush like wind and wave; On, on! the Invader is bought and sold; His own hand hath dug his grave! FLORENCE MAC CARTHY'S FAREWELL TO HIS ENGLISH LOVE. I England's fair child, Evangeline! In that far-distant land of mine There stands a Yew-tree among tombs! For ages there that tree hath stood, A black pall dash'd with drops of blood; O'er all my world it breathes its glooms. II Evangeline! Evangeline! Because my Yew-tree is not thine, Because thy Gods on mine wage war, Farewell! Back fall the gates of brass; The exile to his own must pass: I seek the land of tombs once more. TO THE SAME. We seem to tread the self-same street, To pace the self-same courts or grass; Parting, our hands appear to meet: O vanitatum vanitas! Distant as earth from heaven—or hell— From thee the things to me most dear: Ghost-throng'd Cocytus and thy will Between us rush. We might be near. Thy world is fair: my thoughts refuse To dance its dance or drink its wine; Nor canst thou hear the reeds and yews That sigh to me from lands not thine. THE DIRGE OF KILDARE. A.D. 1595. The North wind clanged on the sharp hill-side: The mountain muttered: the cloud replied; ‘There is one rides up through thy woods, Tyrone! That shall ride on a bier of the pine branch down.’ The flood roars over Danara's bed: 'Twas green at morning: to-night 'tis red: What whispers the raven to oak and cave? ‘Make ready the bier and make ready the grave.’ Kildare, Kildare! Thou hast left the bound Of hawk and heron, of hart and hound; With the hunters art come to the Lion's lair: He is mighty of limb and old. Beware! Beware, for on thee that eye is set Which glared upon Norreys at Clontibret: And that hand is lifted, from horse to heath Which hurled the giant they mourn in Meath! Kildare, Kildare! There are twain this hour With brows turned north from Maynooth's grey tower: The Mother sees nought: the bride shall see The Herald and Death-flag far off—not thee. WAR-SONG OF TIRCONNELL'S BARD AT THE BATTLE OF BLACKWATER. August 14, A.D. 1598. At this battle the Irish of Ulster were commanded by ‘Red Hugh’ O'Neill, Prince of Tyrone, and by Hugh O'Donnell (called also ‘Red Hugh’), Prince of Tirconnell. Queen Elizabeth's army was led by Marshal Bagnal, who fell in the rout with 2,500 of his force. Twelve thousand gold pieces, thirty-four standards, and all the artillery of the vanquished army were taken. I. Glory to God, and to the Powers that fight For Freedom and the Right! We have them then, the Invaders! There they stand At last on Oriel's land! And there the far-famed Marshal holds command, Bagnal, their bravest, at his right That recreant, neither chief nor knight, ‘The Queen's O'Reilly,’ he that sold His country, clan, and church for gold. They have pass'd the gorge stream-cloven, And the mountain's purple bound; Now the toils are round them woven, Now the nets are spread around! Give them time: their steeds are blown;— Let them stand and round them stare, Breathing blasts of Irish air: Our eagles know their own! II. Twin Stars! Twin regents of our righteous war! This day remember whose, and who ye are— Thou that o'er green Tir-owen's Tribes hast sway! Thou whom Tirconnell's vales obey! The line of Nial, the line of Conn So oft at strife, to-day are one! To Erin both are dear; to me Dearest he is, and needs must be My Prince, my chief, my child, on whom So early fell the dungeon's doom. O'Donnell! hear this day thy Bard! By those young feet so maim'd and scarr'd, Bit by the winter's fangs when lost Thou wandered'st on through snows and frost, Remember thou those years in chains thou worest, Snatch'd in false peace from unsuspecting halls, And that one thought, of all thy pangs the sorest, Thy subjects groan'd the upstart Stranger's thralls! That thought on waft thee through the fight: On, on, for Erin's right! III. Seest thou yon stream whose tawny waters glide Through weeds and yellow marsh lingeringly and slowly? Blest is that spot and holy! There, ages past, Saint Bercan stood and cried, ‘This spot shall quell one day the Invaders' pride!’ He saw in mystic trance The blood-stain flush yon rill: On, hosts of God, advance; Your country's fates fulfil! Be Truth this day your might! Truth lords it in the fight! IV. O'Neill! That day be with thee now When, throned on Ulster's regal seat of stone, Thou sat'st and thou alone; While flocked from far the Tribes, and to thy hand Was given the snow-white wand, Erin's authentic sceptre of command! Kingless a People stood around thee! Thou Didst dash the alien bauble from thy brow, And for a coronet laid down That People's love became once more their Monarch's crown! True King alone is he In whom made one his People share the throne: Fair from the soil he rises like a tree: Rock-like the Tyrant presses on it, prone! Strike for that People's cause! For Gaelic rights; for Brehon laws: The sage traditions of civility; Pure hearths, and Faith set free! V. Hark! the thunder of their meeting! Hand meets hand, and rough the greeting! Hark! the crash of shield and brand; They mix, they mingle, band with band, Like two horn-commingling stags Wrestling on the mountain crags, Intertwisted, intertangled, Mangled forehead meeting mangled! Lo! the wavering darkness through I see the banner of Red Hugh; Close beside is thine, O'Neill! Now they stoop and now they reel, Rise once more and onward sail, Like two falcons on one gale! O ye clansmen past me rushing, Like mountain torrents seaward gushing, Tell the chiefs that from this height Their chief of Bards beholds the fight; That on theirs he pours his spirit; Marks their deeds and chants their merit; While the Priesthood evermore, Like him that ruled God's host of yore, With arms outstretch'd that God implore! VI. Mightiest of the line of Conn, On to victory! On, on, on! It is Erin that in thee Lives and works right wondrously! Eva from the heavenly bourne Upon thee her eyes doth turn, She whose marriage couch was spread 'Twixt the dying and the dead! Parcell'd kingdoms one by one For a prey to traitors thrown; Pledges forfeit, broken vows, Roofless fane and blazing house; All the dreadful deeds of old Rise resurgent from the mould, For their judgment peal is toll'd! All our Future takes her stand Hawk-like on thy lifted hand. States that live not, vigil keeping In the limbo of long weeping; Palace-courts and minster-towers That shall make this isle of ours Fairer than the star of morn, Wait thy mandate to be born! Chief elect 'mid desolation Wield thou well the inspiration Thou drawest from a new-born nation! VII. Sleep no longer Bards that hold Ranged beneath me harps of gold! Smite them with a heavier hand Than vengeance lays on axe or brand! Pour upon the blast a song Linking litanies of wrong, Till, like poison-dews, the strain Eat into the Invader's brain. On the retributive harp Catch that death-shriek shrill and sharp, Hers, though choked in blood, whose lord Perish'd, Essex, at thy board! Peerless chieftain! peerless wife! From his throat, and hers, the knife Drain'd the mingled tide of life! Sing the base assassin's steel By Sussex hired to slay O'Neill! Sing, fierce Bards, the plains sword-wasted, Sing the cornfields burnt and blasted, That when raged the war no longer Kernes dog-chased might pine with hunger! Pour around their ears the groans Of half-human skeletons From wet cave or forest-cover Foodless deserts peering over, Or upon the roadside lying Infant dead and mother dying, On their mouth the grassy stain Of the wild weed gnaw'd in vain;— Look upon them hoary Head Of the last of Desmonds dead; Head that evermore dost frown From the Bridge of London down! She that slew him from her barge Makes that Head this hour the targe Of her insults cold and keen, England's Caliph, not her Queen! —Portent terrible and dire Whom thy country and thy sire Branded with a bastard's name, Thy birth was but thy lightest shame! To honour recreant and thine oath; Trampling that Faith whose borrow'd garb First gave thee sceptre, crown, and orb, Thy flatterers scorn, thy lovers loathe That idol with the blood-stained feet Ill-throned on murder'd Mary's seat! VIII. Glory be to Him Alone who holds the nations in His hand! The plain lies bare; the smoke drifts by; they fly—the invaders—band o'er band! Sing, ye priests, your deep Te Deums; bards, make answer loud and long In your rapture flinging heavenward censers of triumphant song. Isle for centuries blind in bondage lift once more thine ancient boast, From the cliffs of Inishowen southward on to Carbery's coast! We have seen the Right made perfect, seen the Hand that rules the spheres Glance like lightning through the clouds, and backward roll the wrongful years. Glory fadeth, but this triumph is no fleeting barren glory; Rays of healing it shall scatter on the eyes that read our story: Upon nations bound and torpid as they waken it shall shine As on Peter in his chains the Angel shone with light divine. From the unheeding, from the unholy it may hide, like Truth, its ray; But when Truth and Justice conquer on their crowns its beam shall play: O'er the ken of troubled despots it shall trail a meteor's glare; For the blameless it shall glitter as the star of morning fair: Whensoever Erin triumphs then its dawn it shall renew; Then O'Neill shall be remember'd, and Tirconnell's chief, Red Hugh! THE TRUE VICTORY. A warrior by his stone-dead lord Fast bleeding sat, and heard on high Three Angels making of a sword, Who sang right merrily: ‘We shape the sword of conquering days:— What jewels shall that sword emboss? Not deeds, but sufferings; shame, not praise, The victories of the Cross.’ THE SUGANE EARL. A.D. 1601. I 'Twas the White Knight that sold him—his flesh and his blood! A Fitz-Gerald betray'd the Fitz-Gerald: Death-pale the false friend in the 'mid forest stood; Close by stood the conqueror's herald! At the cave-mouth he lean'd on his sword, pale and dumb, But the eye that was on him o'erbore him: ‘Come forth,’ cried the White Knight;—one answer'd, ‘I come!’ And the Chief of his House stood before him! II ‘Cut him down,’ said the Outlaw with cold smile and stern, ‘'Twas a bold stake; but Satan hath won it!’— In the days of thy father, Earl Desmond, no kerne Had heard that command, and not done it! The name of the White Knight shall cease, and his race! His castle down fall, roof and rafter! This day is a day of rebuke; but the base Shall meet what he merits hereafter! ORMOND'S LAMENT; OR, THE FOE TURNED FRIEND. I There clung a mist about mine eye, Or else round him a mist there clung: From war to war the years went by, And still that cloud between us hung: That, that he was I saw him not, Old friend, old comrade, fellow-man: I saw but that which chance had wrought; A rival house, a hostile clan. II In vain one Race, one Faith were ours: A common Land, a common Foe: Vainly we chased through Lorha's bowers, In boyhood paired, the flying roe: Sea-caves of Irr! in vain by you Our horses stemmed the heaving floods While freshening gales of morning blew The sunrise o'er the mountain woods! III Ah spells of Fate! Ah Wrath and Wrong! Ah Friend that once my dearest wert! Where lay thine image hid so long But in the centre of my heart? Thou fell'st! a flash from out the past One moment showed thee as of yore: Death followed fast—a midnight blast; And that fair crest was seen no more. IV Ah, great right hand, so brave yet kind! Ah, sovereign eyes! ah, lordly mirth! Thy realm to-day—like me—sits blind: And endless winter chills thy hearth. This day I see thee in thy spring, Though seventy winters make me grey: This night my bards thy praise shall sing: This night for thee my priests shall pray. In Ireland there were occasions when the chief who had pursued an ancient enemy to the death became his sincerest mourner. A chronicler of the seventeenth century affirms that an instance of such a change was found in the Earl of Ormond of Elizabeth's time, called ‘Black Thomas.’ ‘Now, good reader, let there be truce to words, and listen to the whistling of the lash.—.... There was then in Ireland Thomas Butler, Earl of Ormond, who changed his religion in the court of Elizabeth. Brooding over the seandal he had given by his apostacy, he resolved to be reconciled to the Church in his last days. He therefore made his peace with God, edified all by his piety, and soon after, losing the ineffable blessing of sight, was gathered to his fathers. Now, ere he died, he was heard to lament two actions of his life—first, that he had ever renounced that holy religion in his youth which in his old age he was not able to succour; and, secondly, that he had taken up arms against the Geraldines of Desmond, who were ever the strenuous champions of the Faith, and the bulwarks of their country's liberty. Oh, good God! why did Ormond conspire to ruin them?’ (‘The Rise, Increase, and Exit of the Family of the Geraldines, Earls of Desmond, and Palatines of Kerry.’ Written in Latin by Brother Dominicus de Rosario O'Daly, in the seventeenth century, and translated by the Rev. C. P. Meahan.) THE PHANTOM FUNERAL; OR, THE DIRGE OF THE LAST DESMOND. A.D. 1601. James Fitz-Garret, son of the ‘Great Earl of Desmond,’ had been sent to England when a child as a hostage, and was for seventeen years kept a prisoner in the Tower, and educated in the Queen's religion. James Fitz-Thomas, the ‘Sugane Earl,’ having meantime assumed the title and prerogatives of Earl of Desmond, the Queen sent her captive to Ireland, attended by persons devoted to her, and provided with a conditional patent for his restoration. When he reached Kilmallock, on his way to Kerry, wheat and salt were there showered on him by the people, in testimony of loyalty. The next day was Sunday. When the young Earl left his house, it was with difficulty that a guard of English soldiers could keep a path open for him. From street and window and housetop every voice urged him to fidelity to his ancestral faith. The youth, who did not even understand the language in which he was adjured, having reached a spot where two roads separated, took that one which led to ‘the Queen's church,’ as it was called; and with loud cries his clan rushed forth from Kilmallock, and abandoned his standard for ever. Shortly afterwards he returned to England, where he fell sick; and in a few months the news of his death reached his ancient palatinate of Kerry.—See the Pacata Hibernia. THE WAIL OF THE WOMEN OF DESMOND. Strew the bed and strew the bier, (Who rests upon it was never man) With all that a little child holds dear, With violets blue and violets wan. Strew the bed and strew the bier With the berries that redden thy shores, Corann: Lay not upon it helmet or spear:— He knew them never. He ne'er was man. Far off he sleeps; yet we mourn him here; Their tale is falsehood! he ne'er was man! 'Tis a phantom funeral! Strew the bier With white lilies brushed by the floating swan. They lie who say that the false Queen caught him A child asleep on the mountains wide; A captive reared him; a strange faith taught him;— 'Twas for no strange faith that his father died! They lie who say that the child return'd A man unmanned to his towers of pride; That his people with curses the false Earl spurn'd; Woe, woe, Kilmallock! they lie, and lied! The Clan was wroth at an ill report, But now the thunder-cloud melts in tears: The child that was motherless play'd. 'Twas sport! A child must sport in his childish years! Ululah! Ululah! Low, sing low! The women of Desmond loved well that child! Our lamb was lost in the winter snow: Long years we sought him in wood and wild. How many a babe of Fitz-Gerald's blood In hut was foster'd though born in hall! The whole stock burgeon'd the fair new bud, The old land welcomed them, each and all! Glynn weeps to-day by the Shannon's tide, And Shanid and she that frowns o'er Deal; There is woe by the Laune and the Carra's side, And where the Knight dwells by the woody Feale. In Dingle and Beara they chant his dirge; Far off he faded—our child—sing low! We have made him a bed by the ocean's surge; We have made him a bier on the mountain's brow. The Clan was bereft! the old walls they left; With cries they rushed to the mountains drear! But now great sorrow their heart hath cleft; See! one by one they are drawing near! Ululah! Ululah! Low, sing low! The flakes fall fast on the little bier: The yew-branch and eagle-plume over them throw! The last of the Desmond Chiefs lies here. THE MARCH TO KINSALE. December, A.D. 1601. I O'er many a river bridged with ice Through many a vale with snow-drifts dumb Past quaking fen and precipice The Princes of the North are come! Lo, these are they that, year by year, Roll'd back the tide of England's war; Rejoice, Kinsale! thy help is near! That wondrous winter march is o'er. And thus they sang, ‘To-morrow morn Our eyes shall rest upon the foe: Pass on, swift night, in silence borne, And blow, thou breeze of sunrise, blow!’ II Blithe as a boy on march'd the host With droning pipe and clear-voiced harp; At last above that southern coast Rang out their war-steed's whinny sharp: And up the sea-salt slopes they wound, And airs once more of ocean quaff'd; Those frosty woods, the blue wave's bound, As though May touched them waved and laugh'd. And thus they sang, ‘To-morrow morn Our eyes shall rest upon our foe: Pass on, swift night, in silence borne, And blow, thou breeze of sunrise, blow!’ III Beside their watchfires couch'd all night Some slept, some danced, at cards some play'd, While, chanting on a central height Of moonlit crag, the priesthood pray'd: And some to sweetheart, some to wife Sent message kind; while others told Triumphant tales of recent fight, Or legends of their sires of old. And thus they sang, ‘To-morrow morn Our eyes at last shall see the foe: Roll on, swift night, in silence borne, And blow, thou breeze of sunrise, blow!’ KINSALE. January 3, A.D. 1602. What man can stand amid a place of tombs Nor yearn to that poor vanquished dust beneath? Above a Nation's grave no violet blooms; A vanquished Nation lies in endless death. 'Tis past: the dark is dense with ghost and vision! All lost! the air is throng'd with moan and wail: But one day more and hope had been fruition: O Athunree, thy fate o'erhung Kinsale! The inexplicable disaster at Kinsale, when, after their marvellous winter march, the two great Northern chiefs of Tirconnell and Tyrone had succeeded in relieving their Spanish allies there, was one of those events upon which the history of a nation turns. We know little more than that it was a night-attack, the secret of which had been divulged by a deserter. O'Donnell took shipping for Spain, where he died before the promised aid was furnished, in the twenty-ninth year of his age, September 10, 1602. King Philip caused him to be buried in the Cathedral of Valladolid, and raised there a monument in his honour. O'Neill fought his way back to Ulster. Lord Mountjoy had repeatedly wasted the country, so that a terrible famine reigned. Every day O'Neill was more strictly hemmed in; while his allies deserted him and his retainers were starved. When the news arrived of the death of Red Hugh O'Donnell all hope was over. He agreed to the terms proposed to him by Mountjoy, surrendering his claims as a native prince, and engaging to resume his title as Earl of Tyrone. Several days previously the Queen had died; but Mountjoy had concealed this event. A few days later the ships of O'Neill's Spanish allies arrived. He sent them back. What name is that which lays on every head A hand like fire, striking the strong locks grey? What name is named not save with shame and dread? Once let us breathe it,—then no more for aye! Kinsale! accursed be he, the first who bragg'd ‘A city stands where roam'd but late the flock;’ Accursed the day when, from the mountain dragg'd, Thy corner-stone forsook the mother-rock! ROISIN DUBH. DIRGE. I I am black but fair, and the robe I wear Is dark as death; My cheek is pale, and I bind my veil With a cypress wreath. Where the nightshades flower I build the bower Of my secret rest: O kind is sleep to the eyes that weep And the bleeding breast. II My palace floor I tread no more; No throne is mine; No sceptre I hold, nor drink from gold Of victory's wine; Yet I rule a Queen in the worlds unseen By Sassanach eye; A realm I have in the hearts of the brave And an empery. TO NUALA IN ROME. Nuala was the sister of Red Hugh, and of Roderick O'Donnell. The latter died an exile in Rome, A.D. 1608. Nuala left her husband, on his proving a traitor to his country, and clave to her brother. It was on finding her weeping at that brother's grave in S. Pietro Montorio, that O'Donnell's bard addressed to her the tragic ode well known through Clarence Mangan's translation: ‘O Woman of the Piercing Wail!’ Thy shining eyes are vague with tears Though seldom and unseen they flow; The playmate of thy childish years— My friend—at last lies low. If I, thus late, thy love might win Withheld for his sake, brief the gain; I live in battle's ceaseless din: Thou pinest in silent pain. Nuala! exile, and the bread By strangers doled thy cheek make pale; On blue Lough Eirne that cheek was red, In western Ruaidh's gale! The high-neck'd stag looks down no more From sunset cliffs upon thy path In Doire. Not now thou tread'st the shore By Aileach's royal Rath. No more thou hear'st the sea-wind sing O'er cairns where Ulster monarchs sleep; The linnets of the Latian spring They only make thee weep. To thee no joy from domes enskied, Or ruins of Imperial Rome; Thou look'st beyond them, hungry-eyed, T'ward thy far Irish home. On green Tirconnell, now a waste, The sighs of outcasts feed thine own; Nuala! soon my clarion's blast Shall drown that mingled moan. In Spain they call us King and Prince, And plight alliance, and betray; In Rome, through clouds of frankincense Slow dawns our better day. To King or Kaiser, Prince or Pope I sue not, nor to magic spell; Nuala! on this sword my Hope Stands like a God. Farewell! THE ARRAIGNMENT; OR, FIRST AND LAST. Thus sang thy missioned Bard, O'Neill, At James's Court a threatening guest, When Ulster died. Round ranks of steel Ran the sharp whisper ill suppressed. Ho! space for Judgment! squire and groom! Ho! place for Judgment—and a bier! We bear a dead man to his tomb: We ask for Judgment, not a tear. Back, beaming eyes, and cloth of gold, Back, plumes, and stars, and herald's gear, Injustice crowned, and falsehood stoled! There lies a lordlier pageant here! Draw near, Sir King, and lay thy hand Upon this dead man's breast! Draw near! The accusing blood, at God's command, Wells forth! The count is summed. Give ear! Who, partner with a knave abhorred, Dermod, King of Leinster, A.D. 1170. Farmed as his own that Traitor's feud? Vicarious fought? By others' sword Mangled a kingdom unsubdued? Who reigned in great Religion's name, Liegeman and Creedsman of the Pope? Who vindicates his cleric claim By schism and rapine, axe and rope? Who reads by light of blazing roofs His gospel new to Prince and Kerne? Who tramples under horses' hoofs A race expatriate, slow to learn? From holy Ulster, last discrowned— 'Twas falsehood did the work, not war— Who drives her sons by scourge and hound To famished Connacht's utmost shore? Beware false splendours brave to-day! Unkingly King, and recreant peers! Ye hold your prey; but not for aye: The hour is yours: but ours the years! THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FAITH IN ULSTER. A BARDIC ODE. A.D. 1623. Throughout Ulster, and in most parts of Ireland, it had been found impossible to carry the Penal Laws against the Catholic faith fully into effect until the reign of James I. The accession of that prince was hailed as the beginning of an era of liberty and peace. James had ever boasted himself a descendant of the ancient Milesian princes, had had frequent dealings with the Irish chiefs in their wars against Elizabeth, and was believed by them to be, at least in heart, devoted to the religion of his Mother. In the earlier part of his reign, though he refused to grant a legal toleration, he engaged that the Penal Laws should not be executed. In the year 1605 a proclamation was issued, commanding all Catholic priests to quit Ireland under the penalty of death. Next came the compulsory flight of Tirconnell and Tyrone, the Plantation of Ulster, and the swamping of the Irish Parliament by the creation of fictitious boroughs. In 1622 Archbishop Ussher preached before the new Deputy, Lord Faulkland, his celebrated sermon on the text, ‘He beareth not the sword in vain.’ The next year a new proclamation was published, commanding the departure of all the Catholic clergy, regular and secular, within forty days. I. Now we know that they are dead! They, the Chiefs that kept from scaith The northern land—the sentenced Faith— Now we know that they are dead! II. Wrong, with Rapine in her leash, Walk'd her ancient rounds afresh! Law—late come—with leaden mace Smites Religion in the face;— But the spoiler first had place! III. Axes and hammers, hot work and hard! From niche and from turret the Saints they cast; The church stands naked as the churchyard; The craftsman-army toils fiercely and fast: They pluck from the altars the precious stones As vultures pluck at a dead man's eyes; Like wolves down-dragging the flesh from the bones They strip the gold from the canopies. They rifle the tombs; they melt the bells: The foundry furnace bubbles and swells!— Spoiler, for once thou hast err'd; what ho! Thou hast loos'd this shaft from an ill-strung bow! In that Faith thou wouldst strangle, thy Mother died! Who slew her? The Usurper our chiefs defied! Thy heart was with Rome in the days of old; Thy counsel was ours; thy counsel and gold! IV. A ban went forth from the regal chambers, From the Prince that courted us once with lies, From the secular synods where he who clambers, Not he that walks upright, receives the prize: ‘Go back to thy Judah, sad Prophet, go; There wail thy wrong, and denounce thy woe; But no longer in Bethel thy prophecy sing, 'Tis the chapel and court of Samaria's King!’ —Let England renounce her church at will, The children of Erin are faithful still. For a thousand years has that church been theirs:— They are God's, not Cæsar's, the Creeds and Prayers! V. Thou that are haughty and full of bread, The crown falls soon from the unwise head! Who rear strange altars shall find anon The lion thereby and sea-sand thereon! In the deserts of penance they peak and pine Till fulfilled are the days of the wrath divine. Thy covenant make with the cave and the brier For shelter by day and by night for fire; When the bolt is launch'd at the craggy crest, And the cedars flame round the eagle's nest! VI. A voice from the ocean waves, And a voice from the forest glooms, And a voice from old temples and kingly graves, And a voice from the Catacombs! It cries, the king that warreth On religion and freedom entwined in one Down drags in his blindness the fane, nor spareth The noble's hall, nor the throne! I saw in my visions the walls give way Of the mystic Babylon; I saw the gold Idol whose feet are clay On his forehead lying prone; I saw a sea-eagle defaced with gore Flag wearily over the main; But her nest on the cliff she reached no more For the shaft was in her brain. As when some strong man a stone uplifteth And flingeth into floods far down, So God, when the balance of Justice shifteth, Down dasheth the despot's crown, Down dasheth the realm that abused its trust, And the nation that knew not pity, And maketh the image of Power unjust To vanish from out the city! VII. Wait, my country, and be wise;— Thou art gall'd in head and breast, Rest thou needest, sleep and rest; Rest and sleep, and thou shalt rise And tread down thine enemies. That which God ordains is best; That which God permits is good, Though by man least understood. Now His sword He gives to those Who have wisdom won from woes; In them fighting ends the strife: At other times the impious priest Slipping on his victim's blood Falls in death on his own knife! God is hard to 'scape! His ire! Strikes the son if not the sire! King James I.'s ‘Plantation of Ulster’ was the loss of Ireland to his son, and again to his grandson, and consequently the permanent loss to him and his of England. In a time, to God not long, Thou shalt reckon with this wrong! KING CHARLES'S ‘GRACES.’ A.D. 1626. I Thus babble the strong ones, ‘The chain is slacken'd! Ye can turn half round on your side to sleep! With the thunder-cloud still your isle is blacken'd; But it hurls no bolt upon tower or steep. Ye are slaves in name: old laws proscribe you; But the King is kindly, the Queen is fair; They are knaves or fools who would goad or bribe you A legal freedom to claim! Beware!’ II We answer thus: our country's honour To us is dear as our country's life! That stigma the foul law casts upon her Is the brand on the fame of a blameless wife! Once more we answer: from honour never Can safety long time be found apart: The bondsman that vows not his bond to sever, Is a slave by right and a slave in heart! SIBYLLA IERNENSIS. I I dream'd. Great bells around me peal'd; The world in that sad chime was drown'd; Sharp cries as from a battle-field Were strangled in that wondrous sound: Had all the Kings of earth lain dead, Had nations borne them lapp'd in lead To torch-lit vaults with plume and pall, Such bells had served for funeral. II 'Twas work of phantasy! I slept Where black Baltard o'erlooks the deep; Plunging all night the billows kept Their ghostly vigil round my sleep. But I had fed on tragic lore That day—your annals, ‘Masters Four!’ And every moan of wind and sea Was as a funeral chime to me. III I woke. In vain the skylark sang Above the breezy cliff; in vain The golden iris flashed and swang In hollows of the sea-pink plain. As ocean shakes—no longer near— The listening heart, and haunts the ear, The Sibyl and that volume's spells Pursued me with those funeral bells! IV The Irish Sibyl whispers slow To one who pass'd her tardy Lent In purple and fine linen, ‘Lo! Thou would'st amend—but not repent! Beware! Long prospers fearless crime; Half courses bring the perilous time! His way who changes, not his will, Is strong no more, but guilty still.’ THE BALLAD OF ‘BONNY PORTMORE’; The name of an old Irish air. OR, THE WICKED REVENGE. A.D. 1641. I Shall I breathe it? Hush! 'twas dark:— Silence!—few could understand:— Needful deeds are done—not told. In your ear a whisper! Hark! 'Twas a sworn, unwavering band Marching through the midnight cold; Rang the frost plain, stiff and stark: By us, blind, the river rolled. II Silence! we were silent then: Shall we boast and brag to-day? Just deeds, blabbed, have found their price! Snow made dumb the trusty glen; Now and then a starry ray Showed the floating rafts of ice: Worked our oath in heart and brain: Twice we halted: only twice. III When we reached the city wall On their posts the warders slept: By the moat the rushes plained: Hush! I tell you part, not all! Through the water-weeds we crept; Soon the sleepers' tower was gained. My sister's son a tear let fall— Righteous deeds by tears are stained. IV Round us lay a sleeping city: Had they wakened we had died: Innocence sleeps well, they say. Pirates, traitors, base banditti, Blood upon their hands undried, 'Mid their spoils asleep they lay! Murderers! Justice murders pity! Night had brought their Judgment Day! V In the castle, here and there, 'Twixt us and the dawning East Flashed a light, or sank by fits: ‘Patience, brothers! sin it were Lords to startle at their feast, Sin to scare the dancers' wits!’ Patient long in forest lair The listening, fire-eyed tiger sits! VI O the loud flames upward springing! O that first fierce yell within, And, without, that stormy laughter! Like rooks across a sunset winging Dark they dashed through glare and din Under rain of beam and rafter! O that death-shriek heavenward ringing; O that wondrous silence after! The fire-glare showed, 'mid glaze and blister, A boy's cheek wet with tears. 'Twas base! That boy was firstborn of my sister; Yet I smote him on the face! Ah! but when the poplars quiver In the hot noon, cold o'erhead, Sometimes with a spasm I shiver; Sometimes round me gaze with dread. Ah! and when the silver willow Whitens in the moonlight gale, From my hectic, grassy pillow I hear, sometimes, that infant's wail! THE INTERCESSION. Dr. Leland and other historians relate that the Catholic clergy frequently interfered for the protection of the victims of that massacre, which took place at an early period of the Ulster rising of 1641. They hid them beneath their altars. From the landing of Owen Roe O'Neill all such crimes ceased. They disgraced a just cause, and, doubtless, drew down a Divine punishment. A lamentable list of the massacres committed in the same year, at the other side—massacres less generally known—will be found in Cardinal Moran's ‘Persecutions suffered by the Catholics under Cromwell and the Puritans,’ p. 168. It is compiled from a contemporary record. It was intended that Inisfail should represent in the main the songs of the old Irish Bards (if only they could have been preserved), as the best exponent of the Emotions and Imagination of the Race during the centuries of her affliction, but there must have been also many Priests, like Iriel, who were exponents not less true of the Conscience of that Race. To such may be attributed the counsels urged upon them in many parts of Inisfail, and especially towards its close, respecting the forgiveness of injuries, obedience to the Divine Will, Penitence, especially from p. 125 to p. 129 a Hope that nothing could subdue, and those trials connected with the day of Prosperity which are more dangerous than any which Adversity knows. ULSTER. A.D. 1641. Iriel the Priest arose and said: ‘The just cause never shall prosper by wrong! The ill cause battens on blood ill shed; 'Tis Virtue only makes Justice strong. ‘I have hidden the Sassanach's wife and child Beneath the altar; behind the porch; O'er them that believe not these hands have piled The copes and the vestments of Holy Church! ‘I have hid three men in a hollow oak; I have hid three maids in an ocean cave:’ As though he were lord of the thunder-stroke The old Priest lifted his hand—to save. But the people loved not the words he spake; And their face was changed for their heart was sore: They spake no word; but their brows grew black And the hoarse halls roar'd like a torrent's roar. ‘Has the Stranger robb'd you of house and land? In battle meet him and smite him down! Has he sharpen'd the dagger? Lift ye the brand! Has he bound your Princes? Set free the clown! ‘Has the Stranger his country and knighthood shamed? Though he 'scape God's vengeance so shall not ye! His own God chastens! Be never named With the Mullaghmast slaughter! Be just and free!’ But the people received not the words he spake, For the wrong on their heart had made it sore; And their brows grew black like the stormy rack And the hoarse halls roar'd like the wave-wash'd shore. Then Iriel the Priest put forth a curse! And horror crept o'er them from vein to vein;— A curse upon man and a curse upon horse, As forth they rode to the battle-plain. And there never came to them luck or grace No Saint in the battle-field help'd them more Till O'Neill who hated the warfare base Had landed at Doe on Tirconnell's shore. THE SILK OF THE KINE. One of the mystical names for Ireland used by the Bards. DIRGE OF RORY O'MORE. A.D. 1642. Up the sea-sadden'd valley at evening's decline A heifer walks lowing; ‘the Silk of the Kine;’ From the deep to the mountain she roams, and again From the mountain's green urn to the purple-rimm'd main. Whom seek'st thou, sad Mother? Thine own is not thine! He dropp'd from the headland; he sank in the brine. 'Twas a dream! but in dream at thy foot did he follow Through the meadow-sweet on by the marish and mallow! Was he thine? Have they slain him? Thou seek'st him, not knowing Thyself too art theirs, thy sweet breath and sad lowing! Thy gold horn is theirs; thy dark eye, and thy silk! And that which torments thee, thy milk, is their milk! 'Twas no dream, Mother Land! 'Twas no dream, Inisfail! Hope dreams, but grief dreams not—the grief of the Gael! From Leix and Ikerren to Donegal's shore Rolls the dirge of thy last and thy bravest—O'More! THE BATTLE OF BENBURB. A BARDIC ODE. This battle was won by Owen Roe O'Neill over the Parliamentarian forces, A.D. 1646. The rebels left 3,423 of their dead on the field. I. At even I mused on the wrong of the Gael;— A storm rushed beside me with war-blast not wail, And the leaves of the forest plague-spotted and dead Like a multitude broken before it fled; Then I saw in my visions a host back driven Ye clansmen be true, by a Chief from heaven! II. At midnight I gazed on the moonless skies;— There glisten'd, supreme of star-blazonries, A Sword all stars; then heaven, I knew, Hath holy work for a sword to do: Be true, ye clansmen of Nial! Be true! III. At morning I look'd as the sun uprose On hills of Antrim late white with snows; Was it morning only that dyed them red? Martyr'd hosts, methought, had bled On their sanguine ridges for years not few! Ye clansmen of Conn, this day be true! IV. There is felt once more on the earth The step of a kingly man: Like a dead man hidden he lay from his birth, Exiled from his country and clan: This day his standard he flingeth forth; He tramples the bond and ban: Let them look in his face that usurp'd his hearth! Let them vanquish him, they who can! Owen Roe, our own O'Neill! He treads once more our land! The sword in his hand is of Spanish steel, But the hand is an Irish hand! V. I saw in old time with these eyes that fail In 1607 a conspiracy, never proved, and probably never undertaken, was suddenly charged against Tyrone and Tirconnell. To avoid arrest the two earls, whose enforced submission had rendered them helpless, embarked on board a ship that chanced to have anchored in Lough Swilly. They found refuge in Rome, where their tombs are shown to the traveller in the church of San Pietro, on the Janiculan Hill. The Four Masters thus record the tragedy:—‘They embarked on the festival of Holy Cross, in autumn. This was a princely company: and it is certain that the sea has not borne and the wind has not wafted in modern times a number of persons in one ship more eminent, illustrious, or noble in race, heroic deeds, valour, feats of arms, and brave achievements than they. Would that God had but permitted them to remain in their patrimonial inheritance until the children had arrived at the age of manhood! Woe to the heart that meditated, woe to the counsel that recommended the project of this expedition!’ The ship drop down Lough Swilly; Lessening 'mid billows the snowy sail Bent down like a storm-rock'd lily! Far, far it bore them, those Sceptres old That ruled o'er Ulster for ages untold, The sceptre of Nial and the sceptre of Conn, Thy Princes, Tirconnell and green Tyrone! No freight like that since the mountain-pine Left first the hills for the salt sea-brine! Down sank on the ocean a blood-red sun As westward they drifted, when hope was none, With their priests and their children o'er ocean's foam And every archive of house and home: Amid the sea-surges their bards sang dirges: God rest their bones in their graves at Rome! Owen Roe, our own O'Neill! He treads once more our land! The sword in his hand is of Spanish steel, But the hand is an Irish hand! VI. I saw in old time through the drifts of the snow A shepherdless People dash'd to and fro, With hands toss'd up in the wintry air, With the laughter of madness or shriek of despair. Dispersed is the flock when the shepherd lies low: The sword was of parchment: a lie was the blow: What is Time? I can see the rain beat the white hair, And the sleet that defaces the face that was fair, As onward they stagger o'er mountain and moor From the Ardes and Rathlin to Corrib's bleak shore: I can hear the babe weep in the pause of the wind— ‘To Connaught!’ The bloodhounds are baying behind!— Owen Roe, our own O'Neill! He treads once more our land! The sword in his hand is of Spanish steel, But the hand is an Irish hand! VII. Visions no more of the dreadful past! The things that I long'd for are mine at last! I see them and hold them with heart and eyes; On Irish ground, under Irish skies, An Irish army, clan by clan, The standard of Ulster on leading the van! Each chief with his clansmen, tried men like steel; Unvanquish'd Maolmora, Cormac the leal! And the host that meets them right well I know, The psalm-singing boors of that Scot, Munro! —We hated you, Barons of the Pale! But now sworn friends are Norman and Gael; For both the old foes are of lineage old, And both the old Faith and old manners hold. Montgomery, Conway! base-born crew! This day ye shall learn an old lesson anew! Thou art red with sunset this hour, Blackwater But twice ere now thou wert red with slaughter! Another O'Neill by the ford they met; And ‘the bloody loaming’ men name it yet! Owen Roe, our own O'Neill! He treads once more our land! The sword in his hand is of Spanish steel! But the hand is an Irish hand! VIII. The storm of the battle rings out! On! on! Shine well in their faces, thou setting sun! The smoke grows crimson: from left to right Swift flashes the spleenful and racing light: The horses stretch forward with belly to ground: On! on! like a lake which has burst its bound! Through the clangour of brands rolls the laughter of cannon: Wind-borne it shall reach thine old walls, Dungannon! Armagh's grey Minster shall chant again To-morrow at vespers an ancient strain! On, on! This night on thy banks, Loch Neagh Men borne in bondage shall couch them free! On, warriors launch'd by a warrior's hand! Four years ye were leash'd in a brazen band; He counted your bones, and he meted your might, This hour he dashes you into the fight! Strong sun of the battle, great Chief whose eye Wherever it gazes makes victory, This hour thou shalt see them do or die! —They form: there stand they one moment, still! Now, now, they charge under banner and sign: They breast unbroken the slope of the hill, It breaks before them, the Invaders' line! Their horse and their foot are crush'd together Like harbour-locked ships in the winter weather, Each dash'd upon each, the churn'd wave strewing With wreck upon wreck, and ruin on ruin. The spine of their battle gives way with a yell: Down drop their standards: that cry was their knell! Some on the bank and some in the river Struggling they lie that shall rally never. 'Twas God fought for us! with hands of might From on high He kneaded and shaped the fight! To Him be the praise! What He wills must be: With Him is the future: for blind are we! Let Ormond at will make terms or refuse them! Let Charles the Confederates win or lose them; Unbind the old Faith and annul the old strife, Or cheat us, and forfeit his kingdom and life! Come hereafter what must or may Ulster, thy cause is avenged to-day: What fraud took from us and force, the sword That strikes in daylight makes ours, restored! Owen Roe, our own O'Neill! He treads once more our land! The sword in his hand is of Spanish steel, But the hand is an Irish hand! TRADITOR ISTE. A WAIL. I Can it be, can it be? Can our Great One be Traitor? Can the child of her greatest be faithless to Eire? The clown and the stranger have wronged—let them hate her! Old Thomond well knows them; they hate her for hire! Can a brave man be leagued with the rebels and ranters 'Gainst his faith, and his country, his king, and his race, Can he bear the low moanings, the curses, the banters?— There's a scourge worse than these—the applause of the base! II Was the hand that set fire to the Churches descended From his hand who upreared them—the strong hand, the true? When the blood of the People and Priesthood ran blended Who was it looked on, and cried, ‘Spare them not’? Who? Some Fury o'erruled thee! Some root thou hadst eaten! 'Twas a Demon that stalked in thy shape. 'Twas not thou! Not tears of the Angels that blood-stain can sweeten; That Cain-mark not death can erase from thy brow! DIRGE OF OWEN ROE O'NEILL. A.D. 1649. So, 'tis over! Lift the dead! Bear him to his place of rest, Broken heart, and blighted head: Lay the Cross upon his breast. There be many die too late; Here is one that died too soon: The conqueror of Benburb died (by poison as was believed at the time) just after he and Ormond had concluded terms for joint action against Cromwell. Had he not been summoned to Kilkenny when on the point of following up the victory of Benburb, the Puritan army must, within a few days, have been driven out of Ulster. 'Twas not Fortune—it was Fate After him that cast her shoon. Toll the church bells slowly: toll! God this day is wroth with Eire: Seal the book, and fold the scroll; Crush the harp, and burst the wire. Lords and priests, ye talked and talked In Kilkenny's Council Hall; But this man whose game ye baulked Was the one man 'mong you all! 'Twas not in the field he fell! Sing his requiem, dark-stoled choir! Let a nation sound his knell: God this day is wroth with Eire! THE BISHOP OF ROSS. A.D. 1650. They led him to the peopled wall: ‘Thy sons!’ they said, ‘are those within! If at thy word their standards fall, Thy life and freedom thou shalt win!’ Then spake that warrior Bishop old, ‘Remove these chains that I may bear My crosier staff and cope of gold: My judgment then will I declare.’ They robed him in his robes of state: They set his mitre on his head: On tower and gate was silence great: The hearts that loved him froze with dread. He spake: ‘Right holy is your strife! Fight for your Country, King, and Faith. I taught you to be true in life: I teach you to be true in death. ‘A priest apart by God is set To offer prayer and sacrifice: And he is sacrificial yet The pontiff for his flock who dies.’ Ere yet he fell, his hand on high He raised, and benediction gave; Then sank in death, content to die: Thy great heart, Erin, was his grave. DIRGE. A.D. 1652. I Whose were they those voices? What footsteps came near me? Can the dead to the living draw nigh and be heard? I wept in my sleep; but ere morning to cheer me Came a breeze from the woodland, a song from the bird. O sons of my heart! the long-hair'd, the strong-handed! Your phantoms rush by me with war-cry and wail: Ye too for your Faith and your Country late banded My sons by adoption, mail'd knights of the Pale! II Is there sorrow, O ye that pass by, like my sorrow? Of the Kings I brought forth there remaineth not one! Each day is dishonour'd; disastrous each morrow: In the yew-wood I couch till the daylight is done. At midnight I lean from the cliff o'er the waters, And hear, as the thunder comes up from the sea Your moanings, my sons, and your wailings, my daughters: With the sea-dirge they mix not: they clamour to me! THE WHEEL OF AFFLICTION. Bright is the Dream-land of them that weep; Of the outcast head on the mountains bare: Thy Saints, O Eire, I have seen in sleep; Thy Queens on the battle-plain, fierce yet fair. Three times I dreamed on Tyrawley's shore: Through ranks of the Vanished I paced a mile: On the right stood Kings, and their crowns they wore: On the left stood Priests without gold or guile. But the vision I saw when the deep I crossed, When I crossed from Iorras to Donegal By night on the vigil of Pentecost Was the saddest vision yet best of all. From the sea to the sky a Wheel rolled round: It breathed a blast on the steadfast stars; 'Twas huge as that circle with marvels wound— The marvels that reign o'er the Calendars. Then an Angel spake, ‘That Wheel is Earth; It grinds the wheat of the Bread of God:’ And the Angel of Eire, with an Angel's mirth, ‘The mill-stream from Heaven is the Martyrs' blood.’ EPILOGUE. Like dew from above it fell, from beyond the limits of ether; From above the courses of stars, and the thrones of angelical choirs; ‘If God afflicts the Land, then God of a surety is with her; Her heart-drops counts like beads, and walks with her through the fires. ‘Time, and a Time, and Times! Earth's noblest birth was her latest: That latest birth was Man; his flesh her Redeemer wears: Time, and a Time, and Times! one day the least shall be greatest: In glory God reaps, but sows below in the valley of tears.’ It was no Seraph's song nor the spheral chime of creation, That Voice! To earth it stooped as a cloud to the ocean flood: It had ascended in sighs from the anguished heart of a nation;— The musical echo came back from the boundless bosom of God. PART III. Prologue. PARVULI EJUS. In the night, in the night, O my Country, the stream calls out from afar: So swells thy voice through the ages, sonorous and vast: In the night, in the night, O my Country, clear flashes the star: So flashes on me thy face through the gloom of the past. I sleep not; I watch: in blows the wind ice-wing'd, and ice-finger'd: My forehead it cools and slakes the fire in my breast; Though it sighs o'er the plains where oft thine exiles look'd back, and long linger'd, And the graves where thy famish'd lie dumb and thine outcasts find rest. For up from those vales wherein thy brave and thy beautiful moulder, And on through the homsteads waste and the temples defiled, A voice goes forth on that wind, as old as the Islands and older, ‘God reigns: at His feet earth's Destiny sleeps like a child.’ IN RUIN RECONCILED. A.D. 1660. I heard a Woman's voice that wailed Between the sandhills and the sea: The famished sea-bird past me sailed Into the dim infinity. I saw on boundless rainy moors Far off I saw a great Rock loom; The grey dawn smote its iron doors; And then I knew it for a Tomb. Two queenly shapes before the grate Watched, couchant on the barren ground; Two regal Shades in ruined state, One Gael; one Norman; both discrowned. THE CHANGED MUSIC. I The shock of meeting clans is o'er: The knightly or the native shout Pursues no more by field or shore From rath to cairne, the ruined rout. O'er dusty stalls old banners trail In mouldering fanes: while far beneath At last the Norman and the Gael Lie wedded in the caves of death. II No more the Bard-song! dead the strains That mixed defiance, grief, and laugh: Old legends haunt no more the plains, Half saintly and barbaric half. Changed is the music. Sad and slow Beyond the horizon's tearful verge The elegiac wailings flow The fragments of the broken dirge. THE MINSTREL OF THE LATER DAY. I What art thou, O thou Loved and Lost That, fading from me, leav'st me bare? The last trump of a vanquished host Far off expiring on the air So cheats in death the listener's ear As thou dost cheat this aching heart:— To me thy Past looked strangely near; Distant and dim seems that thou art. II O Eire! the things I loved in thee Were dead long years ere I was born: Yet still their shadows lived for me An evening twilight like the morn; But daily now with vulgarer hand The Present sweeps those phantoms by:— Like annals of an alien land Thy history's self appears to die. ODE. THE ‘CURSE OF CROMWELL’; OR, THE DESOLATION OF THE WEST. In trance I roamed that Land forlorn, By battle first, then famine worn; I walked in gloom and dread: The Land remained: the hills were there: The vales: but few remained to share That realm untenanted. Far-circling wastes, far-bending skies; Clouds as at Nature's obsequies Slow trailing scarf and pall: In whistling winds on creaked the crane: Grey lakes upstared from moor and plain Like eyes on God that call. Turn where I might, no blade of green Diversified the tawny scene: Bushless the waste, and bare: A dusky red the hills as though Some deluge ebbing years ago Had left but seaweed there. Dark red the vales: that single hue O'er rotting swamps an aspect threw Monotonous yet grand: Long-feared—for centuries in decay— Like a maimed lion there it lay, What once had been a Land. Yet, day by day, as dropt the sun A furnace glare through vapours dun Illumed each mountain's head: Old tower and keep their crowns of flame That hour assumed; old years of shame Like fiends exorcised, fled. That hour, from sorrow's trance awaking, My soul, like day from darkness breaking With might prophetic fired To those red hills and setting suns Returned antiphonal response As gleam by gleam expired. And in my spirit grew and gathered Knowledge that Ireland's worst was weathered Her last dread penance paid; Conviction that for earthly scath In world-wide victories of her Faith Atonement should be made. That hour as one who walks in vision Of God's ‘New Heavens’ I had fruition And saw, and inly burned: And I beheld the multitude Of those whose robes were washed in blood Saw chains to sceptres turned! And I saw Thrones, and Seers thereon Judging, and Tribes like snow that shone And diamond towers high-piled, Towers of that City theirs at last Through tribulations who have passed, And theirs, the undefiled. A Land became a Monument! Man works; but God's concealed intent Converts his worst to best: The first of Altars was a Tomb— Ireland! thy grave-stone shall become God's Altar in the West! PEACE. Seraph that from the blue abyss O'erlook'st the storms round earth that roll While we, by fragments wildered, miss The dread perfection of the whole Draw near at last! A moment lean Upon that earth's tumultuous breast Thy hand heart-healing, and serene And grant the anguished planet rest! THE BALLAD OF THE LADY TURNED BEGGAR. The Irish who fought for Charles I., and whose estates were confiscated on that account, looked in vain, with a few exceptions, for their restoration on the accession of Charles II. The widow of one of these Royalists, Lord Roche, in her old age used to be seen begging in the streets of Cork. I. ‘Drop an alms on shrunken fingers,’ faintly with a smile she said; But the smile was not of pleasure, and unroselike was the red: ‘Fasts wear thin the pride fantastic;—one I left at home lacks bread.’ II. Lady! hard is the beginning—so they say—of shameless sinning: Ah but, loss disguised in winning, easier grows it day by day, May thy shamefaced, sinless pleading to the unhearing or the unheeding Lacerate less an inly bleeding bosom ere those locks grow grey; Locks whose midnight once was lighted with the diamond's changeful ray! III. Silks worn bare with work's abusing; cheek made wan with hailstorm's bruising; Eye its splendour slowly losing; state less stately in decay; Chanting ballad or old ditty year by year she roam'd the city: Love at first is kin to pity; pity to contempt, men say; Wonder lessen'd, reverence slacken'd, as the raven locks grew grey. IV. What is that makes sadness sadder? What is that makes madness madder? Shame, a sharper-venomed adder, gnaws when looks once kind betray! ‘She is poor: the poor are common! 'Twas a countess: 'tis a woman; Looks she has at times scarce human: England! there should be her stay: 'Twas for Charles the old lord battled—Charles and England—so men say.’ V. Charles! Whitehall! the wine, the revel! No, she sinks not to that level! Mime or pander; king or devil; she will die on Ireland's shore! Ne'er, till Portsmouth's brazen forehead grows with virtuous blushes florid Will she pass that gate abhorrèd, climb that staircase, tread that floor; Let that forehead wear the diamond which Lord Roche's widow wore! VI. Critic guest through Ireland wending, careless praise with cavil blending, Wonder not, in old man bending, or in beggar boys at play, Wonder not at aspect regal, princely front or eye of eagle: Common these where baying beagle, or the wirehair'd wolf-hound grey Chased old nobles once through woodlands which the ignoble made their prey. Centuries three that sport renewed they—thrice a century—so men say. THE IRISH SLAVE IN BARBADOES. Beside our shieling spread an oak, Close by, a beech, its brother: Between them rose the pale blue smoke; They mingled each with other. The gold mead stretched before our door Beyond the church-tower taper; The river wound into the moor In distance lost and vapour. Amid green hazels, cradle-swung, Our babe with rapture dancing, Watched furry shapes the roots among, With beaded eyes forth glancing. Ah, years of blessing! Rich no more Yet grateful and contented, The lands that Stafford from us tore No longer we lamented. So fared it till that night of woe When, from the mountains blaring, The deep horns rang ‘The foe, the foe!’ And fires were round us glaring. He went: next day our hearth was cold, Then came that week of slaughter:— I woke within the ship's black hold And heard the rushing water. Ah! those that seemed our life can die Yet we live on and wither! Fling out thy fires, thou Indian sky: Toss all thy torches hither! Send, salt morass and swamps of cane Send forth your ambushed fever! O death, unstrain at last my chain And bid me rest for ever! ARCHBISHOP PLUNKET. (THE LAST VICTIM OF THE ‘POPISH PLOT.’) July 11, A.D. 1681. ‘The Earl of Essex went to the king (Charles II.) to apply for a pardon, and told his Majesty “the witnesses must needs be perjured, as what they swore could not possibly be true.” But his Majesty answered in a passion, “Why did you not declare this, then, at the trial? I dare pardon nobody— his blood be upon your head, and not mine!”’—Haverty's History of Ireland. See also Cardinal Moran's Life of Archbishop Plunket. Why crowd ye windows thus, and doors? Why climb ye tower and steeple? What lures you forth, O senators? What goads you here, O people? Here there is nothing worth your note— 'Tis but an old man dying: The noblest stag this season caught And in the old nets lying! Sirs, there are marvels, but not here: Here's but the threadbare fable Whose sense nor sage discerns, nor seer; Unwilling is unable! That prince who lurk'd in bush and brake While bloodhounds bay'd behind him Now, to his father's throne brought back, In pleasure's mesh doth wind him. The primate of that race, whose sword Stream'd last to save that father, To-day is reaping such reward As Irish virtues gather. His Faith King Charles partakes—and hides! Ah, caitiff crowned, and craven! Not his to breast the rough sea tides; He rocks in peaceful haven. Great heart! Pray well in heaven this night From dungeon loosed, and hovel, For souls that blacken in God's light, That know the Truth, yet grovel. A BALLAD OF SARSFIELD; OR, THE BURSTING OF THE GUNS. A.D. 1690. Sarsfield rode out the Dutch to rout, And to take and break their cannon; To mass went he at half-past three, And at four he cross'd the Shannon. Tirconnel slept. In dream his thoughts Old fields of victory ran on; And the chieftains of Thomond in Limerick's towers Slept well by the banks of Shannon. He rode ten miles and he cross'd the ford, And couch'd in the wood and waited; Till, left and right, on march'd in sight That host which the true men hated. ‘Charge!’ Sarsfield cried; and the green hill-side As they charged replied in thunder; They rode o'er the plain and they rode o'er the slain, And the rebel rout lay under! He burn'd the gear the knaves held dear, For his King he fought, not plunder; With powder he cramm'd the guns, and ramm'd Their mouths the red soil under. The spark flash'd out like a nation's shout The sound into heaven ascended; The hosts of the sky made to earth reply And the thunders twain were blended! Sarsfield rode out the Dutch to rout, And to take and break their cannon;— A century after, Sarsfield's laughter Was echoed from Dungannon. A BALLAD OF ATHLONE; OR, HOW THEY BROKE DOWN THE BRIDGE. Does any man dream that a Gael can fear? Of a thousand deeds let him learn but one! The Shannon swept onward, broad and clear Between the leaguers and worn Athlone. ‘Break down the bridge!’ Six warriors rushed Through the storm of shot and the storm of shell: With late, but certain, victory flushed The grim Dutch gunners eyed them well. They wrenched at the planks 'mid a hail of fire: They fell in death, their work half done: The bridge stood fast; and nigh and nigher The foe swarmed darkly, densely on. ‘O who for Erin will strike a stroke? Who hurl yon planks where the waters roar?’ Six warriors forth from their comrades broke And flung them upon that bridge once more. Again at the rocking planks they dashed; And four dropped dead; and two remained: The huge beams groaned, and the arch downcrashed;— Two stalwart swimmers the margin gained. St. Ruth in his stirrups stood up and cried, ‘I have seen no deed like that in France!’ With a toss of his head Sarsfield replied ‘They had luck, the dogs! 'Twas a merry chance!’ O many a year upon Shannon's side They sang upon moor and they sang upon heath Of the twain that breasted that raging tide, And the ten that shook bloody hands with Death! THE REQUITAL. I We too had our day; it was brief: it is ended— When a King dwelt among us; no strange King but ours! When the shout of a People delivered ascended And shook the broad banner that hung on his towers. We saw it like trees in a summer breeze shiver; We read the gold legend that blazoned it o'er: ‘To-day; now or never! To-day and for ever!’ O God, have we seen it to see it no more? II How fared it that season, our lords and our masters, In that spring of our freedom how fared it with you? Did we trample your Faith? Did we mock your disasters? We restored but his own to the leal and the true. Ye had fallen? 'Twas a season of tempest and troubles: But against you we drew not that knife ye had drawn; In the war-field we met; but your prelates and nobles Stood up 'mid the senate in ermine and lawn! THE LAST MAC CARTHYMORE. Ön thy woody heaths, Muskerry—Carbery, on thy famish'd shore, Hands hurl'd upwards, wordless wailings, clamour for Mac Carthymore! He is gone; and never, never shall return to wild or wood Till the sun burns out in blackness and the moon descends in blood. He, of lineage older, nobler, at the latest Stuart's side Drew once more his father's sword for Charles in blood of traitors dyed: Once again the stranger fattens where Mac Carthys ruled of old, For a later Cromwell triumphs in the Dutchman's muddier mould. Broken boat and barge around him, sea-gulls piping loud and shrill, Sits the chief where bursts the breaker, and laments the sea-wind chill In a barren northern island dinn'd by ocean's endless roar Where the Elbe with all his waters streams between the willows hoar. Earth is wide in hill and valley; palace courts and convent piles Centuries since received thine outcasts, Ireland, oft with tears and smiles: Wherefore builds this grey-hair'd Exile on a rockisle's weedy neck? Ocean unto ocean calleth; inly yearneth wreck to wreck! He and his, his Church and Country, King and kinsmen, house and home, Wrecks they are like broken galleys strangled by the yeasty foam: Nations past and nations present are or shall be soon as these— Words of peace to him come only from the breast of raging seas. Clouds and sea-birds inland drifting o'er the sea-bar and sand-plain; Belts of mists for weeks unshifting; plunge of devastating rain; Icebergs as they pass uplifting aguish gleams through vapours frore, These, long years, were thy companions, O thou last Mac Carthymore! When a rising tide at midnight rush'd against the downward stream Rush'd not then the clans embattled meeting in the Chieftain's dream? When once more that tide exhausted died in murmurs towards the main Died not then once more his slogan, ebbing far o'er hosts of slain? Pious river! let us rather hope the low monotonies Of thy broad stream seaward toiling and the willowbending breeze Charm'd at times a midday slumber, tranquillised tempestuous breath, Music last when harp was broken, requiem sad and sole in death. A HUNDRED YEARS; OR, RELIGIO NOVISSIMA. There is an Order by a northern sea, Far in the West, of rule and life more strict Than that which Basil reared in Galilee, In Egypt Paul, in Umbria Benedict. Discalced it walks; a stony land of tombs A strange Petræa of late days, it treads! Within its court no high-tossed censer fumes; The night-rain beats its cells, the wind its beds. Before its eyes no brass-bound, blazon'd tome Reflects the splendour of a lamp high-hung: Knowledge is banish'd from her earliest home Like wealth: it whispers psalms that once it sung. It is not bound by the vow celibate Lest, through its ceasing, anguish too might cease; In sorrow it brings forth; and Death and Fate Watch at Life's gate, and tithe the unripe increase. It wears not the Franciscan's cord or gown; The cord that binds it is the Stranger's chain: Scarce seen for scorn, in fields of old renown It breaks the cold; another reaps the grain. Year after year it fasts; each third or fourth So fasts that fasts of men to it are feast; Then of its brethren many in the earth Are laid unrequiem'd like the mountain-beast. Where are its cloisters? Where the felon sleeps! Where its novitiate? Where the last wolf died! From sea to sea its vigil long it keeps— Stern Foundress! is its Rule not mortified? Thou that hast laid so many an Order waste, A Nation is thine Order! It was thine Wide as a realm that Order's seed to cast, And undispensed sustain its discipline. QUOMODO SEDET SOLA. How sits the City lonely and uncrowned; (Thus the old Priests renewed that Hebrew song) ‘The Lamentations.’ She sits a widowed queen in weepings drowned; Her friends revile her who should mourn her wrong. Behold, her streets are silent and her gate; And as the sea her sorrows are increased. The Daughter of my People, desolate; And no man mounteth to her solemn feast. To them that brought her comfort she hath said, ‘My children strove, and each by each is slain: I turned from Him to Whom my youth was wed: Therefore the heathen hosts my courts profane. ‘The bruised reed He brake not; neither cried, Nor strove, nor smote: He set the prisoners free: But sons of mine oppressed His poor, and lied, Nor walked in judgment and in equity.’ Thus sang the Priests, and ended, ‘Christ was led Lamb-like to death. His mouth He opened not: He gave His life to raise from death the dead: That God Who sends our penance shared our lot.’ SPES UNICA. I Between two mountains' granite walls one star Shines in this sea-lake quiet as the grave; The ocean moans against its rocky bar; That star no reflex finds in foam or wave. II Saints of our country: if—no more a Nation— Vain are henceforth her struggles, from on high Fix in the bosom of her desolation So much the more that Hope which cannot die! SEDERUNT IN TERRA. ‘The Lord hath spread His net about her feet And down hath hurled her wall in heaps around;’ Thus sang her Elders, as their breasts they beat, Her virgins with their garlands on the ground. ‘The head of Sion to the dust is brought: Her Kings are slain or scattered by the sword: Her ancient Law is made a thing of nought: Her Prophets find not Vision from the Lord. ‘Because they showed thee not thy sin of old, Servants this day have lordship o'er thy race: From thine own wells thou draw'st thy drink for gold; And Gentile standards mock thy Holy Place. ‘Thy little children made an idle quest— “Where—where is bread?” As wounded men they lay In every street. Upon their mothers' breast At last they breathed their souls in death away.’ The Priests made answer, ‘Christ on Olivet Prayed to His Father. Pray thou well this day. His chalice passed Him not. Therefore thy debt Is cancelled. Watch with Him one hour, and pray.’ DEEP CRIETH UNTO DEEP. I Beside that Eastern sea—there first exalted— Thus sang, not Bard, but Priest, ‘The Cross lies low!’ Sad St. Sophia, 'neath thy roofs gold-vaulted Who kneels this hour? the blind and turban'd Foe! II O Eire! a sister hast thou in thy sorrow! If thine the earlier, hers the bitterer moan: She weeps to-day; great Rome may weep tomorrow! Claim not that o'er-proud boast—to weep alone. ADHÆSIT LINGUA LACTANTIS. ‘Thy woes have made thy heart as iron hard: Lo! the sea-monsters yield their young the breast; But thou the gates of thine increase hast barred; And scorn'st to grant thine offspring bread or rest. ‘Thy lordly ones within thy womb conceived And nursed in scarlet, wither is thy drouth; The tongue of him, thy suckling babe, hath cleaved To that dry skin which roofed his milkless mouth. ‘Put down thy lips into the road-side dust; And whisper softly through that dust, and say, “Although He slay me, yet in God I trust; He made, and can re-make me. Let Him slay!” ‘Behold! to tarry for the Lord is good; His faithfulness for ever shall remain; His mercies as the mornings are renewed: The man that waits Him shall not wait in vain. ‘Within thy bones He made His fire to burn That thou might'st hate the paths thy feet have trod: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return;’ Thus sang the Priests. ‘Thy refuge is thy God.’ THE PROMISE. I As the church-bells rolled forth their sonorous Evangel, Their last ere the Stranger usurped the old pile, I heard 'mid their clangour the voice of an Angel Give words to that music which rushed o'er the Isle: ‘In thousand-fold echoes, thy God, unforsaking, That peal shall send back from the heavenly bourne: O hearts that are broken, O hearts that are breaking, Be strong, for the glories gone by shall return.’ II Thenceforth in the wood and the tempests that din it In the thunder of mountains the moan of the shore, That chime I can hear and the clear song within it The voice of that Angel who sings evermore, ‘The Faith shall grow vast though the Faithful grow fewer; By sorrow uplifted ascendeth their Throne Who resist the ill deed but not hate the ill-doer, Who forgive, unpartaking, all sins but their own.’ [Only a reed that sighed—] Only a reed that sighed— And the Poplar grove hard by From a million of babbling mouths replied, ‘Who cares, who cares? Not I!’ Only a dove's low moan— And the new-gorged raven near Let fall from the red beak the last white bone, And answered, half croak, half sneer. Only the Silk of the Kine Far driven on the foot that bled: And only old Argial's bleeding pine; And the Black Rose that once was red. ODE. THE CYCLIC RENOVATION. I The unvanquish'd Land puts forth each year New growth of man and forest; Her children vanish; but on her, Stranger, in vain thou warrest! She wrestles, strong through hope sublime, Thick darkness round her pressing Wrestles with God's great Angel, Time And wins, though maim'd, the blessing. II As night draws in what day sent forth As Spring is born of Winter As flowers that hide in parent earth Re-issue from the centre, Our Land takes back her wasted brood, Our Land in respiration, Breathes from her deep heart unsubdued A renovated nation! III A Nation dies: a People lives:— Through Signs Celestial ranging A Race's Destiny survives Unchanged, yet ever changing: The many-centuried Wrath goes by; But while earth's tumult rages ‘In cœlo quies.’ Burst and die Thou storm of temporal ages! IV Burst, and thine utmost fury wreak On things that are but seeming! First kill; then die; that God may speak, And man surcease from dreaming! That Love and Justice strong as love May be the poles unshaken Round which a world new-born may move And Truth that slept may waken! THE SPIRITUAL RENOVATION. I. The Watchman stood on the turret: He looked to the south and the east: But the Kings of the south were sleeping, And the eastern Kings at feast. Not yet is thy help: not yet Hast thou paid the uttermost debt: Not reached is the worst, thou Weeper:— Though thy feet—God meteth their tread— Have dinted the green sea's bed, There are depths in the mid sea deeper! Not all God's waves and His billows As yet have gone over thy head, That Penance and Faith should be lords o'er Death, And that Hell should be vanquishèd. II. I heard thine Angel that sighed Three times, ‘Descend to the deep.’ I heard at his side the Archangel that cried ‘To the depth that is under the deep.’ Who made thee and shaped thee of old It is He in the darkness that lays thee With the cerements around thee ninefold; That Earth, when the waking is thine, May look on His Hand divine, And answer, ‘None other might raise thee III. Noble, and Chieftain and Prince, They were thine in thy day, and died: The head and the members were scattered long since!— Shall a sinew, or nerve abide? So long as of that dead clay Two atoms together cleave God's trumpet that calls thee thou canst not obey, His promise receive and believe. So long as the seed, the husk, The body of death, and the prison, Holds out, undissolved, in the dusk So long in his pains and his chains The unglorified Spirit remains; The New Body unrisen. A SONG OF THE BRIGADE. The Irish Brigade, consisting originally of soldiers of James II., took service with more than one continental sovereign. In many a land it made the name of Ireland famous. The Brigade was recruited from Ireland till the latter part of the eighteenth century, and it is said that, from first to last, nearly 500,000 men belonged to it. I snatched a stone from the bloodied brook And hurled it at my household door! No farewell of my love I took: I shall see my friend no more. I dashed across the churchyard bound: I knelt not by my parents' graves: There rang from my heart a clarion's sound That summoned me o'er the waves. No land to me can native be That strangers trample and tyrants stain: When the valleys I loved are cleansed and free They are mine, they are mine again! Till then, in sunshine or sunless weather, By Seine and Loire, and the broad Garonne, My war-horse and I roam on together Wherever God wills. On! on! A SONG OF THE BRIGADE. River that through this purple plain Toilest—once redder—to the main Go, kiss for me the banks of Seine; Tell him I loved, and love for aye, That his I am though far away, More his than on the marriage-day. Tell him thy flowers for him I twine When first the slow sad mornings shine In thy dim glass; for he is mine. Tell him when evening's tearful light Bathes those dark towers on Aughrim's height There where he fought in heart I fight. A freeman's banner o'er him waves! So be it! I but tend the graves Where freemen sleep whose sons are slaves. Tell him I nurse his noble race Nor weep save o'er one sleeping face Wherein those looks of his I trace. For him my beads I count when falls Moonbeam or shower at intervals Upon our burn'd and blacken'd walls: And bless him! bless the bold Brigade— May God go with them, horse and blade, For Faith's defence, and Ireland's aid! SONG. I Not always the winter! not always the wail! The heart heals perforce where the spirit is pure! The apple smells sweet in the glens of Imayle; The blackbird sings loud by the Slane and the Suir! There are princes no more in Kincora and Tara, But the gold-flower laughs out from the Mague at Athdara; And the Spring-tide that wakens the leaf in the bud, Sad Mother, forgive us, shoots joy through our blood! II Not always the winter! not always the moan! Our fathers, they tell us, in old time were free: Free to-day is the stag in the woods of Idrone, And the eagle that fleets from Loch Lene o'er the Lee! The blue-bells rise up where the young May hath trod; The souls of our martyrs are reigning with God! Sad Mother, forgive us! yon skylark no choice Permits us! From heaven he is crying ‘Rejoice!’ A SONG OF THE BRIGADE. A.D. 1706. I What sound goes up among the Alps! The shouts of Irish battle! The echoes reach their snowy scalps; From cliff to cliff they rattle! In vain he strove—the Duke—Eugene:— That flying host to rally: The squadrons green, they swept it clean Beyond Marsiglia's valley. II Who fixed their standards on thy wall, Long-leaguered Barcelona! Unfallen, who saw the bravest fall? Reply, betrayed Cremona! O graves of Sarsfield and of Clare! O Ramillies and Landen, O'Brien, Lord Clare, fell at the battle of Ramillies, A.D. 1706; Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan, on the field of Landen, A.D. 1693. Catching in his hand the blood that trickled from his death-wound, he exclaimed, ‘O that this had been for Ireland!’ Their brand we bear: their faith we share Their cause we'll ne'er abandon! III Years passed: again went by the Bard The law that banned him braving: Where blood of old had stained the sward Summer corn was waving: The tempest of a sudden joy Uplifting stave and stanza, The valleys echoed ‘Fontenoy,’ The wild sea-shore ‘Almanza!’ THE SEA-WATCHER. I The crags lay dark in strange eclipse: From waves late flushed the glow was gone: The topsails of the far-off ships Alone in lessening radiance shone: Against a stranded boat a maid Stood leaning gunwale to her breast, As though its pain that pressure stayed: Her large eyes rested on the west. II ‘Beyond the sea! beyond the sea! The weeks, the months, the years go by! Ah! when will some one say of me “Beyond the sky! beyond the sky!” And yet I would not have thee here To look upon thy country's shame: For me the tear: for me the bier: For thee fair field, and honest fame. THE FRIENDLY BLIGHT. I A march-wind sang in a frosty wood 'Twas in Oriel's land on a mountain brown While the woodman stared at the hard black bud, And the sun through mist went down: ‘Not always,’ it sang, ‘shall triumph the wrong For God is stronger than man, they say:’ Let no man tell of the March-wind's song, Till comes the appointed day. II ‘Sheaf after sheaf upon Moira's plain, And snow upon snow on the hills of Mourne! Full many a harvest-moon must wane Full many a Spring return! The Right shall triumph at last o'er wrong: Yet none knows how, and none the day:’— The March-wind sang; and bit 'mid the song The little black bud away! III ‘Blow south-wind on through my vineyard blow!’ So pray'd that land of the palm and vine; O Eire, 'tis the north wind and wintry snow That strengthen thine oak and pine! The storm breaks oft upon Uladh's hills; Oft bursts the wave on the stones by Saul; In God's time cometh the thing God wills For God is the Lord of all! THE NEW RACE. I O ye who have vanquish'd the Land and retain it, How little ye know what ye miss of delight! There are worlds in her heart, could ye seek it or gain it, That would clothe a true Noble with glory and might. What is she, this Isle which ye trample and ravage, Which ye plough with oppression and reap with the sword, But a harp, never strung, in the hall of a savage Or a fair wife embraced by a husband abhorr'd? II The chiefs of the Gael were the People embodied; The chiefs were the blossom, the People the root! Their conquerors the Normans, high-soul'd, and high-blooded, Grew Irish at last from the scalp to the foot. But ye! ye are hirelings and satraps not Nobles! Your slaves, they detest you; your masters, they scorn! The river lives on; but its sun-painted bubbles Pass quick, to the rapids insensibly borne. THE IRISH EXILE AT FIESOLE. I Here to thine exile rest is sweet: Here, Mother-land, thy breath is near him! Thy pontiff, Donat, raised his seat On these fair hills that still revere him; Like him that thrill'd the Helvetian vale, St. Gall's, with rock-resounded anthem: For their sakes honour'd is the Gael: The peace they gave to men God grant them! II Far down in pomp the Arno winds By domes the boast of old Religion; The eternal azure shining blinds Serene Ausonia's queenliest region. Assunta be her name! for bright She sits, assumed 'mid heavenly glories; But ah! more dear, though dark like night, To me, my loved and lost Dolores! III The mild Franciscans say—and sigh— ‘Weep not except for Christ's dear Passion!’ They never saw their Florence lie, Like her I mourn, in desolation! On this high crest they brood in rest, The pines their Saint and them embowering, While centuries blossom round their nest Like those slow aloes seldom flowering. IV ‘Salvete, flores Martyrum?’ Such was the Roman Philip's greeting In banner'd streets with myrtles dumb The grave-eyed English college meeting: There lived an older martyr-land! All realms revered her; none would aid her; Or reaching forth a tardy hand Enfeebled first, at last betrayed her! V Men named that land a ‘younger Rome!’ She lit the north with radiance golden; Alone survives the Catacomb Of all that Roman greatness olden! Her Cathall at Taranto sate: Virgilius! Saltzburgh was thy mission! Who sow'd the Faith fast long, feast late; Who reap'd retain unvex'd fruition. VI Peace settles on the whitening hair; The heart that burned grows cold and colder; My Resurrection spot is there Where those Etrurian ruins moulder. Foot-sore, by yonder pillar's base My rest I make, unknown and lowly: And teach the legend-loving race To weep a Troy than theirs more holy. WINTER SONG. The high-piled cloud drifts on as in scorn Like a ghost, half pining, half stately, Or a white ice-island in silence borne O'er seas congeal'd but lately. With nose to the ground like a wilder'd hound O'er wood-leaves yellow and sodden On races the wind but cannot find One sweet track where Spring hath trodden. The moor is black; with frosty rime The wither'd brier is beaded; The sluggard Spring hath o'erslept her time, The Spring that was never more needed. What says the oak-leaf in the night-cold noon, And the beech-stock scoffing and surly? ‘Who comes too soon is a witless loon Like the clown that is up too early.’ But the moss grows fair when the trees are bare, The dumb year finds a pillow there; And beside it the fern with its green crown saith ‘Best bloometh the Hope that is rooted in death.’ GAIETY IN PENAL DAYS. BEATI IMMACULATI. ‘The storm has roar'd by; and the flowers reappear Like a babe on the battle-field born, the new year Through wrecks of the forest looks up on the skies With a smile like the windflower's, and violet eyes. ‘There's warmth in the sunshine; there's song in the wood: There's faith in the spirit, and life in the blood; We'll dance though the Stranger inherits the soil: We'll sow though we reap not! For God be the toil! ‘O Earth that renewest thy beautiful youth! “The meek shall possess thee!” Unchangeable Truth! A childhood thou giv'st us 'mid grey hairs reborn As the gates we approach of perpetual morn!’ In the halls of their fathers an alien held feast; Their church was a cave and an outlaw their priest; The birds have their nests and the foxes have holes— What had these? Like a sunrise God shone in their souls! DIRGE. I Ye trumpets of long-buried hosts Peal, peal no longer in mine ears! No more afflict me, wailing ghosts Of princedoms quell'd and vanished years! Freeze on my face, forbidden tears: And thou, O heart whose hopes are dead Sleep well, like hearts that sleep in lead Embalmed 'mid royal sepulchres. II The stream that one time rolled in blood A stainless crystal winds to-day: Fresh scions of the branded wood Detain the flying feet of May: The linnet chants 'mid ruins grey; The young lambs bound the graves among:— O Mother-land! he does thee wrong Who with thy playmates scorns to play. UNA. To the knee she stood 'mid rushes And the broad, dark stream swept by her: Smiles went o'er her, smiles and blushes As the stranger's bark drew nigh her; Near to Clonmacnoise she stood: Shannon past her wound in flood. By her side a wolf-hound wrestled With a bright boy bold as Mars; On her breast an infant nestled Like to her, but none of hers; A golden iris graced her hand— All her gold was in that wand. O'er the misty, moorish margin Frown'd a ruin'd tower afar; Some one said, ‘This peasant virgin Comes from chieftains great in war! Princes once had bow'd before her: Now the reeds alone adore her!’ Refluent dropt, that bark on gliding, The wave it heaved along the bank: Like worldings still with fortune siding The reed-beds with it backward sank. Farewell to her! The rushing river Must have its way. Farewell for ever! DOUBLE-LIVED; OR, RACES CROWNED. I Before the award, in those bright Halls That rest upon the rolling spheres, Like kingly patriarchs God instals Long-suffering Races proved by years; They stand, the counterparts sublime Of shapes that walk this world of woe, Triumphant there in endless prime While militant on earth below. II As earth-mists build the snowy cloud So Spirits risen, that conquered Fate, Age after age up-borne in crowd, That counterpart Assumed create: Some form the statue's hand or head: Some add the sceptre or the crown: Till the great Image, perfected, Smiles on its mortal semblance down. III There stand the Nations just in act, Or cleansed by suffering, cleansed not changed: They stand of martyr Souls compact, Round heaven's crystalline bastions ranged. Among those Gods Elect art thou, My Country—loftier hour by hour! The earthly Erin bleeds below: The heavenly reigns and rules in power. ADDUXIT IN TENEBRIS. They wish thee strong: they wish thee great! Thy royalty is in thy heart! Thy children mourn thy widow'd state In funeral groves. Be what thou art! Across the world's vainglorious waste, As o'er Egyptian sands, in thee God's hieroglyph, His shade is cast, A bar of black from Calvary. Around thee many a land and race Have wealth or sway or name in story; But on that brow discrown'd we trace The crown expiatory. DIRGE. I O woods that o'er the waters breathe A sigh that grows from morn till night; O waters with your voice like death, And yet consoling in your might; Ye draw, ye drag me with a charm, As when a river draws a leaf, From silken court and citied swarm To your cold homes of peace in grief. II In boyhood's pride I trod the shore While slowly sank a crimson sun Revealed at moments, hid once more By rolling mountains gold or dun: But now I haunt its marge when day Hath laid his fulgent sceptre by, And tremble over waters grey Long windows of a hueless sky. IRISH AIRS I On darksome hills thy songs I hear:— Nor growths they seem of minstrel art Nor wanderers from Urania's sphere, But voices from thine own deep heart! They seem thine own sad oracles Not uttered by thy sons but thee, Like waters forced through stony cells Or winds from cave and hollow tree. II From thee what forced them? Futile quest! What draws to widowed eyes the tears? The milk to Rachel's childless breast? The blood to wounds unstaunched of years? Long cling the storm-drops—cling yet shake— On cypress-spire and cedar's fan: Long rust upon the guilty brake The heart-drops of the murdered man. HOPE IN DEATH. I Descend, O Sun, o'er yonder waste, O'er moors and meads and meadows: Make gold a world but late o'ercast; With purple tinge the shadows! Thou goest to bless some happier clime Than ours; but sinking slowly To us thou leav'st a hope sublime Disguised in melancholy. II A Love there is that shall restore What Death and Fate take from us; A secret Love whose gift is more Than Faith's authentic promise, A Love that says, ‘I hide awhile For sense, that blinds, is round you:’ O well-loved dead! ere now the smile Of that great Love has found you! THE DECREE. I Hate not the Oppressor! He fulfils Thy destiny decreed—no more: What cometh, that the Eternal wills: Be ours to suffer and adore. O Thou the All-Holy, Thou the All-Just! Thou fling'st Thy plague upon the blast: We hide our foreheads 'mid the dust In penance till the wrath be past. II The nations sink, the nations rise On the dread fount of endless Being, Bubbles that burst beneath the eyes Of Him the all-shaping and all-seeing. Thou breath'st, and they are made! Behold, Thy breath withdrawn they melt, they cease: Our fathers were Thy Saints of old, O grant at last their country peace! SAINT BRIGID OF THE LEGENDS. A BARD SONG. A soft child-saint she lit the shade With brightness more than human: Her little hand was soft, they said, As any breast of woman. Through ways bemired to haunts of woe She sped, nor hindrance heeded: Yet still her foot retained its snow; No stream her white robe needed. It chanced one eve she moved, foot-bare, Among the kine sweet-breathing, With boughs the insect tribe to scare Their hornèd foreheads wreathing. Slowly on her their dark eyes grave They rolled in sleepy pleasure Like things by music charmed, and gave Their milk in twofold measure. That hour there passed a beggar clan Through sultry fields on faring: ‘Come drink,’ she cried, ‘from pail and pan!’ That small hand was unsparing. In wrath her Mother near them drew: Those pails that late held nothing, Like fountains tapped foamed up anew And buzzed with milk-floods frothing! O Saint, the favourite of the poor, The afflicted, weak, and weary! Like Mary's was that face she bore: Men called her ‘Erin's Mary.’ In triple vision God to her Revealed her country's story: She saw the cloud its greatness blur She saw, beyond, its glory! Kildare of Oaks! thy quenchless Faith, Her gift it was: she taught it! The shroud Saint Patrick wore in death, 'Twas she, 'twas she that wrought it! Thus sang they on the sunburnt land Among the stacks of barley; And singing, smiled, by breezes fanned From Erin's dream-land early. SAINT COLUMBA'S STORK. A MINSTREL SONG. Columba dashed into the war: Heart-stricken then for penance prayed: ‘See thou thy native land no more:’— The Hermit spake: the Saint obeyed. He sailed: he reached an island green; Alone he clomb its grassy steep: Though dimly, Eire could still be seen: Once more he launched into the deep. Iona's soil at last he trod; There, there once more, they say he mixed His hymns of Eire with hymns of God Standing with wide eyes southward fixed. Three years went by. One stormy morn He grasped a Monk that near him stood: ‘Go down to yonder beach forlorn O'er which the northward sea-mists scud. ‘There, bleeding thou shalt find ere long A Stork from Eire that loves her well Sore wounded by the tempest's wrong: Uplift and bear her to thy cell. ‘Three days that Stork shall be thy guest: The fourth o'er yonder raging main The exile, strong through food and rest, Will seek her native Eire again.’ The Monk obeyed. The Stork he found, And fed, three days. Those three days o'er The exile, soaring, gazed around, Then winged her to her native shore. The Harper ended. Loud and shrill They raised their shout and praised that Stork, And praised the Saint that, exiled, still Could sing for Eire; for God could work. THE GRAVES. In the Cambrian valleys with sea-murmurs haunted The grave-yards at noontide are fresh with dawn-dew; On the virginal bosom white lilies are planted 'Mid the monotone whisper of pine-tree and yew. In the dells of Etruria, where all day long warbles The night-bird, the faithful 'mid cloisters repose: And the long cypress shadow falls black upon marbles That cool aching hearts like the Apennines' snows. In Ireland, in Ireland the wind ever sighing Sings alone the death-dirge o'er the just and the good; In the abbeys of Ireland the bones are round lying Like blocks where the hewer stands hewing the wood. THE LONG DYING. The dying tree no pang sustains; But, by degrees relinquishing Companionship of beams and rains, Forgets the balmy breath of Spring: From off the enringèd trunk that keeps His annual count of ages gone Th' embrace of Summer slowly slips: Still stands the giant in the sun: His myriad lips, that suck'd of old The dewy breasts of heaven, are dry; His root remit the crag, the mould; Yet painless is his latest sigh: He falls; the forests round him roar;— Ere long on quiet bank and copse Untrembling moonbeams rest; once more The startled babe his head down-drops: But ah for one who never drew From age to age a painless breath! And ah the old wrong ever new! And ah the many-centuried death A BARD'S LOVE FOR ERIN. I I thought it was thy voice I heard;— Ah no! the ripple burst and died; Among cold reeds the night-wind stirr'd; The yew-tree sigh'd; the earliest bird Answer'd the white dawn far descried. II I thought it was a tress of thine That grazed my cheek and touched my brow;— Ah no! in sad but calm decline 'Twas but my ever grapeless vine Slow-waving from the blighted bough. III O Eire, it is not ended! Soon, Or late, thy flower renews its bud! In sunless quarries still unhewn Thy statue waits; thy sunken moon Shall light once more the autumnal flood! IV Memory for me her hands but warms O'er ashes of thy greatness gone; Or lifts to heaven phantasmal arms, Muttering of talismans and charms, And grappling after glories flown. V Tired brain, poor worn-out palimpsest! Sleep, sleep! man's troubles soon are o'er:— When in dark crypts my relics rest Star-high shall flash my Country's crest, Where birds of darkness cannot soar! UNREVEALED. Grey Harper, rest!—O maid, the Fates On those sad lips have press'd their seal! Thy song's sweet rage but indicates That mystery it can ne'er reveal. Take comfort! Vales and lakes and skies, Blue seas, and sunset-girded shore, Love-beaming brows, love-lighted eyes, Contend like thee. What can they more? SHANID'S KEEP. I A Conqueror stood upon Shanid's brow And, ‘Build me aloft,’ he cried, ‘A castle to rule o'er the meads below From the hills to the ocean's side!’ In green Ardineer, far down, alone A beggar girl sang her song, A sorrowful dirge for a roof o'erthrown And a fire stamped out by wrong. II The beggar girl's song in the wind was drowned: A moment it lived: no more: The Conqueror's castle went back to the ground, Went back after centuries four: The great halls crumbled from roof to moat; The grey Keep alone remains: But echoes still of the girl's song float All over the lonely plains. SAINT BRIGID OF THE CONVENTS. She looked not on the face of man: Nor husband hers, nor brother: But where she passed the children ran And hailed that Maid their Mother! In haste she fled soft mead and grove For Virtue's region hilly: They called her, 'mid the birds, the Dove, Among the flowers, the Lily. In woods of Oriel—Leix's vales— Her convent homes she planted Where Erin's cloistered nightingales Their nocturns darkling chanted. By many a Scottish moorland wide, By many an English river, Men loved of old their ‘good Saint Bride;’ But Erin loves for ever! A sword went forth; thy fanes they burn'd! Sweet Saint, no anger fret thee! There are that ne'er thy grace have spurned: There are that ne'er forget thee! Thus sang they while the autumnal glade Exchanged green leaf for golden; And later griefs were lighter made By thought of glories olden. IN FAR LANDS. I see, I see the domes ascend O Seville, o'er thy Guadalquiver: I see thy breeze-touched cypress bend; I hear thy moonlit palm-grove shiver: I know that honour here to those Who suffered for the Faith is given; I know, I know that earthly woes Are secret blessings crowned in heaven: But ah! against Dunluce's crags To watch our green sea-billows swelling! And ah! once more to hear the stags In Coona's stormy oakwoods belling! SAINT COLUMBA'S FAREWELL. A MINSTREL SONG. The exiles gazed on headlands theirs no more, Lough Swilly's mountain portals dimly seen: Sing us that song Columba sang of yore Then sang the Minstrel, 'mid the sad, serene. Farewell to Aran Isle, farewell! I steer for Hy: Iona. my heart is sore: The breakers burst, the billows swell 'Twixt Aran Isle and Alba's Scotland. shore. Thus spake the Son of God, ‘Depart!’ O Aran Isle, God's will be done! By Angels thronged this hour thou art: I sit within my bark alone. O Modan, well for thee the while! Fair falls thy lot, and well art thou! Thy seat is set in Aran's Isle: Northward to Alba turns my prow. O Aran, Sun of all the West! My heart is thine! As sweet to close Our dying eyes in thee as rest Where Peter and where Paul repose! O Aran, Sun of all the West! My heart in thee its grave hath found: He walks in regions of the blest The man that hears thy church-bells sound! O Aran blest, O Aran blest! Accursed the man that loves not thee! The dead man cradled in thy breast— No demon scares him: well is he! Each Sunday Gabriel from on high For so did Christ our Lord ordain Thy Masses come to sanctify With fifty angels in his train. Each Monday Michael issues forth To touch with blood each sacred fane: Each Tuesday cometh Raphael To bless the hearth and bless the grain Each Wednesday cometh Uriel, Each Thursday Sariel, fresh from God; Each Friday cometh Ramael To bless thy stones and bless thy sod. Each Saturday comes Mary, Comes Babe in arm, 'mid heavenly hosts! O Aran, near to heaven is he That hears God's angels bless thy coasts! The Minstrel sang, and ceased; while women's tears Shone, sunset-brightened, on pure cheeks and pale; And dreadful less became in children's ears The hoarse sea-dirges, and the rising gale. ARBOR NOBILIS. I Like a cedar our greatness arose from the earth; Or a plane by some broad-flowing river; Like arms that give blessing its boughs it put forth: We thought it would bless us for ever. The birds of the air in its branches found rest; The old lions couched in its shadow; Like a cloud o'er the sea was its pendulous crest; It murmur'd for leagues o'er the meadow. II Was a worm at its root? Was it lightning that charr'd What age after age had created? Not so! 'Twas the merchant its glory that marr'd And the malice that, fearing it, hated. Its branches lie splintered; the hollow trunk groans Like a church that survives desolations; But the leaves, scatter'd far when the hurricane moans, For the healing are sent to the nations! ST. COLUMBA OF THE LEGENDS. A week ere yet her Saint was born Columba's mother prayed alone— Thus sang the Bard on Ascension Morn— Then the Angel of Eire before her shone. He lifted a Veil snow-white, yet red With Roses wrought around and around: And ‘These are the Wounds of Love,’ he said. ‘That heal the wounded, and wound hearts sound. He dropped that Veil on her head; and lo! A wind from God outstretched it wide; And a golden glory suffused its snow; And the heart of its Roses grew deeplier dyed. Like a cloud of dawn on the breeze it flew; Yet it clung to her holy head the while; It spanned the woods, and the headlands blue; It circled and girdled with joy the Isle! And this was a sign that, come what might, In gloom or glory, in good or ill, Columba's Gospel with love and light Should clasp and comfort his Erin still: A sign, and a pledge, and a holy troth That hath not failed her, and never can; For God to Columba sware an oath That Eire should be dear to the God made Man; More dear as the centuries onward rolled, When her bread should be shame, and grief her wine; And mantled more closely with fold on fold Of healing radiance and strength divine. Thus sang to the vanquished the Bard Maelmire, As the tide swelled up on the grassy shore And the smooth sea filled with the sunset's fire: He sang; and the weepers wept no more. THE HERMIT'S COUNSEL. I Thus spake the hermit: Count it gain, The scoff, the stab, the freezing fear: Expiate on earth thine earthly stain; The fire that cleanseth, find it here! Nearest we stand to heavenly light When girt by Purgatorial glooms: That Church which crowns the Roman height Three centuries trod the Catacombs! II But when thy God His Hand withdraws, And all things round seem glad and fair, Unchallenged Faith, impartial laws, And wealth and honour, then beware! Beware lest sin in splendour deck'd Make null the years of holy sighs, And God's great People, grief-elect, Her birthright scorning, miss the prize. EVENING MELODY. Fresh eve, that hang'st in yon blue sky On breeze-like pinions swaying, And leav'st our earth reluctantly Departing, yet delaying! Along the beach the ripples rake; Dew-drench'd the thicket flushes; And last year's leaves in bower and brake Are dying 'mid their blushes. Is this the world we knew of yore, Long bound in wintry whiteness Which here consummates more and more Its talismanic brightness? To music wedded well-known lines Let forth a hidden glory: Thus, bathed in sunset, swells and shines Lake, woodland, promontory. New Edens pure from Adam's crime Invite the just to enter; The spheres of wrongfull Life and Time Grow lustrous to their centre. Rejoice, glad planet! Sin and Woe, The void, the incompleteness, Shall cease at last; and thou shalt know The mystery of thy greatness! CARO REQUIESCET. Look forth, O Sun, with beam oblique O'er crags and lowlands mellow; The dusky beech-grove fire, and strike The sea-green larch-wood yellow: All round the deep, new-flooded meads Send thy broad glories straying; Each herd that feeds 'mid flowers and weeds In golden spoils arraying: Flash from the river to the bridge Red glance with glance pursuing; Fleet from low sedge to mountain ridge, Whatever thou dost undoing: Kiss with moist lip those vapoury bands That swathe yon slopes of tillage; Clasp with a hundred sudden hands The gables of yon village: But O, thus sharping to a point O, brightening thus while dying, Ere yet thou diest the graves anoint Where my beloved are lying! Ye shades that mount the moorland dells Ascend, the tree tops dimming; But leave those amethystine hills Awhile in glory swimming! THE SECRET OF POWER. Dark, dark that grove at the Attic gate By the sad Eumenides haunted Where the Theban King in his blindness sat While the nightingales round him chanted! In a grove as dark of cypress, and bay Upgrown to a forest's stature In vision I saw at the close of day A Woman of godlike feature. She stood like a Queen, and her vesture green Shone out as a laurel sun-lighted; And she sang a wild song like a Mourner's keen With an Angel's triumph united. She sang like one whose grief is done; Who has solved Life's dread enigma; A beam from the sun on her brow was thrown And I saw there the conquering Stigma. EVENING MELODY. O that the pines which crown yon steep Their fires might ne'er surrender! O that yon fervid knoll might keep While lasts the world, its splendour! Pale poplars on the breeze that lean And in the sunset shiver O that your golden stems might screen For aye yon glassy river! That yon white bird on homeward wing Soft-sliding without motion And now in blue air vanishing Like snow-flake lost in ocean Beyond our sight might never flee, Yet forward still be flying, And all the dying day might be Immortal in its dying! Pellucid thus in saintly trance Thus mute in expectation What waits the Earth? Deliverance? Ah no! Transfiguration! She dreams of that ‘New Earth’ divine Conceived of seed immortal; She sings ‘Not mine the holier shrine, Yet mine the steps and portal!’ THE ‘OLD LAND.’ I Ah, kindly and sweet, we must love thee perforce! The disloyal, the coward alone would not love thee: Ah, Mother of heroes! strong Mother! soft nurse! We are thine while the large cloud swims onward above thee! By thy hills ever-blue that draw Heaven so near; By thy cliffs, by thy lakes, by thine ocean-lull'd highlands; And more—by thy records disastrous and dear, The shrines on thy headlands, the cells in thine islands! II Ah, well sings the thrush by Lixnaw and Traigh-li! Ah, well breaks the wave upon Umbhall and Brandon! Thy breeze o'er the upland blows clement and free And o'er fields, once his own, which the hind must abandon. A caitiff the noble who draws from thy plains His all, yet reveres not the source of his greatness; A clown and a serf 'mid his boundless domains His spirit consumes in the prison of its straitness. III Through the cloud of its pathos thy face is more fair: In old time thou wert sun-clad; the gold robe thou worest! To thee the heart turns as the deer to her lair Ere she dies—her first bed in the gloom of the forest. Our glory, our sorrow, our Mother! Thy God In thy worst dereliction forsook but to prove thee! Blind, blind as the blindworm; cold, cold as the clod Who seeing thee see not, possess but not love thee! TO ETHNEA READING HOMER. Ah, happy he who shaped the words Which bind thee in their magic net; Who draws from those old Grecian chords The harmonies that charm thee yet! Who waves from that illumined brow The dark locks back;—upon that cheek Pallid erewhile as Pindan snow Makes thus the Pindan morning break! 'Tis he that fringes lids depress'd With lashes heavier for a tear And shakes that inexperienced breast With womanhood. Upon the bier Lies cold in death the hope of Troy; Thou hear'st the Elders sob around, The widow'd wife, the orphan'd boy, The old grey King, the realm discrown'd. Hadst thou but lived that hour by thee Well wept had been the heroic dead; The heroic hands well kissed; thy knee Had propp'd the pallid princely head! From thee Andromache had caught Dirges more sweet; and she who burn'd With self-accusing grief shame-fraught A holier woe from thee had learn'd! Ah child! Thy Troy in ruin lies Like theirs! Her princes too are cold: Again Cassandra prophesies Vainly prophetic as of old. Brandon to Ida's cloudy verge Responds. Tirawley's kingless shore Wails like the Lycian when its marge Saintly Sarpedon trod no more. Not Gods benign, like Sleep and Death Who bore that shepherd-monarch home But famine's tooth and fever's breath Our exiles hunt o'er ocean's foam. Peace reigns in heaven. The Fates each hour Roll round earth's wheel through darkness vast: Alone survives the Poet's power, A manlike Art that from the past Draws forth that line whose sanguine track The wicked fear, the weak desert; That clue which leads through centuries back The patriot to his Country's heart. GRATTAN. I God works through man, not hills or snows! In man, not men, is the godlike power; The man, God's potentate, God foreknows; He sends him strength at the destined hour: His Spirit He breathes into one deep heart: His cloud He bids from one mind depart: A Saint!—and a race is to God re-born! A Man! One man makes a Nation's morn! II A man, and the blind land by slow degrees Gains sight! A man, and the deaf land hears! A man, and the dumb land like wakening seas Thunders low dirges in proud, dull ears! A man, and the People, a three days' corse, Stands up, and the grave-bands fall off perforce; One man, and the nation in height a span To the measure ascends of the perfect man. III Thus wept unto God the land of Eire: Yet there rose no man and her hope was dead: In the ashes she sat of a burn'd-out fire; And sackcloth was over her queenly head. But a man in her latter days arose; A Deliverer stepp'd from the camp of her foes: He spake; the great and the proud gave way, And the dawn began which shall end in day! THE SECRET JOY. O, blithesome at times is life perforce When Death is the gate of Hope not Fear; Rich streams lie dumb; over rough stones course The runlets that charm the ear. ‘Her heart is hard; she can laugh,’ men say; ‘That light one can jest who has cause to sigh!’ Her conscience is light; and with God are they She loves: they are safe—and nigh. God's light shines brightest on cheeks grief-pale! The song of the darkling is sad and dark: That proud one boasts of her nightingale! O Eire, keep thou thy lark! INSIGHT. Sharp stretch the shades o'er the sward close-bitten Which the affluent meadows receive but half; Truth lies clear-edged on the soul grief-smitten Congeal'd there in epitaph. A vision is thine by the haughty lost; An Insight reserved for the sad and pure: On the mountain cold in the grey hoar frost Thy Shepherd's track lies sure! SONG. The Little Black Rose Mystical names applied to Ireland by her Bards. shall be red at last! What made it black but the East wind dry And the tear of the widow that fell on it fast? It shall redden the hills when June is nigh! The Silk of the Kine Mystical names applied to Ireland by her Bards. shall rest at last! What drave her forth but the dragon-fly? In the golden vale she shall feed full fast With her mild gold horn, and her slow dark eye. The wounded wood-dove lies dead at last: The pine long-bleeding, it shall not die! —This song is secret. Mine ear it pass'd In a wind o'er the stone-plain of Athenry. THE CLUE. To one in dungeons bound there came, The last long night before he died, An Angel garlanded with flame Who raised his hand and prophesied: ‘Thy life hath been a dream: but lo! This night thine eyes shall see the truth: That which thou thoughtest weal was woe; And that was joy thou thoughtest ruth. ‘Thy Land hath conquer'd through her loss; With her God's chief of Creatures plain'd, The same who scaled of old the Cross When Mary's self beneath remain'd. Dante's description of Holy Poverty. ‘Thou fought'st upon the righteous side: Yet, being dust, thou wroughtest sin: Once—twice—thy hand was raised in pride: The Promised Land thou may'st not win; ‘But they, thy children, shall.’ Next morn Around the Patriot-martyr press'd A throng that cursed him. He in turn, The sentenced, bless'd them—and was bless'd. ODE ON THE FIRST REPEAL OF THE PENAL LAWS. A.D. 1778. I The hour has struck! at last in heaven The golden shield an Angel smites! On Erin's altars thunder-riven A happier Destiny alights. 'Tis done that cannot be undone The lordlier ages have begun; The flood that widens as it flows Is loosed; fulfilled the Triple Woes! II Once more the Faith uplifts her forehead Star-circled to the starry skies: Fangless at last, a snake abhorred, Beneath her foot Oppression lies: Above the waning moon of Time The Apparition stands sublime From hands immaculate, hands of light Down scattering gifts of saintly might. III Long for her martyrs Erin waited: They came at last. Rejoice this hour Ye tonsured heads, or consecrated That sank beneath the stony shower! Thou Land for centuries dark and dumb Arise and shine! thy light is come! Return; for they are dead their knife Who raised, and sought the young child's life. IV Again the wells of ancient knowledge Shall cheer the thirsty lip and dry: Again waste places, fane and college, The radiance wear of days gone by! Once more shall rise the Minster porch; Once more shall laugh the village church O'er plains that yield the autumnal feast Once more to industry released! V Once more the far sea-tide returneth And feeds the rivers of the Land: Once more her heart maternal yearneth With hopes the growth of memories grand. Immortal longings swell her breast Quickened from dust of Saints at rest: Once more six centuries bud and flower To share the triumph of this hour! VI Who was it called thee the Forsaken? A consort judged? a Wife put by? He at whose nod the heavens are shaken 'Tis He Who hails thee from on high. ‘I loved thee from of old: I saved: Upon My palms thy name is graved: With blood were sealed the bridal vows; For lo, thy Maker is thy Spouse!’ VII Who, who are those like clouds of morning That sail to thee o'er seas of gold? That fly, like doves, their exile scorning, To windows known and loved of old? To thee the Isles their hands shall raise; Thy sons have taught them songs of praise; And Kings rebuild thy wall, or wait Beside thy never-closing gate. VIII As from the fig-tree, tempest-wasted The untimely fruitage falleth crude, So dropp'd around thee, blighted, blasted Age after age thy sentenced brood. To thee this day thine own are given: Yet what are these to thine in heaven? They left thee in thy years of pain: Thy cause they pleaded—not in vain. IX Those years are o'er: made soft by distance Old wars like war-songs soon will seem, The aggression dire, the wild resistance Put on the moonlight of a dream. Ah, gentle Foes! If wholly past— That Norman foe was friend at last! Like him, the ill deed redress, recall— In Erin's heart is room for all. THE CAUSE. I The Kings are dead that raised their swords In Erin's right of old; The Bards that dash'd from fearless chords Her name and praise lie cold: But fix'd as fate her altars stand; Unchanged, like God, her Faith; Her Church still holds in equal hand The keys of life and death. II As well call up the sunken reefs Atlantic waves rush o'er As that old time of native chiefs And Gaelic Bards restore! Things heavenly rise: things earthly sink: God works through Nature's laws; Sad Isle, 'tis He that bids thee link Thine Action with thy Cause! MEMORY. ‘They are past, the old days: let the past be forgotten: Let them die the old wrongs and old woes that were ours Like the leaves of the winter down-trampled and rotten That light in the spring-time the forest with flowers.’ So sings the sweet voice! But the sad voice replieth; ‘Unstaunch'd is the wound while the insult remains; The Tudor's black banner above us still flieth; The Faith of our fathers is spurned in their fanes! ‘Distrust the repentance that clings to its booty! Give the people their Church and the priesthood its right: Till then, to remember the past is a duty, For the past is our Cause, and our Cause is our might.’ ALL-HALLOWS; OR, THE MONK'S DREAM. A PROPHECY. I I trod once more that place of tombs: Death-rooted elder full in flower Oppress'd me with its sad perfumes, Pathetic breath of arch and tower: The ivy on the cloister wall Waved, gusty with a silver gleam: The moon sank low: the billows' fall In moulds of music shaped my dream. II In sleep a funeral chant I heard A ‘De profundis’ far below; On the long grass the rain-drops stirr'd As when the distant tempests blow: Then slowly, like a heaving sea, The graves were troubled all around; And two by two, and three by three, The monks ascended from the ground. III From sin absolved, redeem'd from tears There stood they, beautiful and calm, The brethren of a thousand years With lifted brows and palm to palm! On heaven they gazed in holy trance; Low stream'd their beards and tresses hoar: And each transfigured countenance The Benedictine impress bore. IV By Angels borne the Holy Rood Encircled thrice the church-yard bound; They paced behind it, paced in blood, With bleeding feet, but foreheads crown'd; And thrice they breathed that hymn benign, Which angels sang when Christ was born; And thrice I wept, ere tower or shrine Had caught the first white beam of morn. V Down on the earth my brows I laid; In these, His Saints, I worshipp'd God: And then return'd that grief which made My heart since youth a frozen clod: ‘O ye,’ I wept, ‘whose woes are past Look round on all these prostrate stones! To these can Life return at last? Can Spirit lift once more these bones?’ VI The smile of him the end who knows Went, luminous, o'er them as I spake; Their white locks shone like mountain snows. O'er which the orient mornings break: They stood: they pointed to the West: And lo! where darkness late had lain Rose many a kingdom's citied crest Reflected in a kindling main! VII ‘Not only these, the fanes o'erthrown, Shall rise,’ they said, ‘but myriads more; The seed, far hence by tempests blown, Still sleeps on yon expectant shore. Send forth, sad Isle, thy reaper bands! Assert and pass thine old renown: Not here alone—in farthest lands For thee thy sons shall weave the crown.’ VIII They spake; and like a cloud down sank The just and filial grief of years; And I that peace celestial drank Which shines but o'er the seas of tears. Thy Mission flashed before me plain, O thou by many woes anneal'd! And I discern'd how axe and chain Had thy great destinies sign'd and seal'd! IX That seed which grows must seem to die: In thee, when earthly hope was none, The heaven-born hope of days gone by By martyrdom matured, lived on; Conceal'd, like limbs of royal mould In some Egyptian pyramid, Or statued shape 'mid cities old Beneath Vesuvian ashes hid. X For this cause by a power divine Each temporal aid was frustrated: Tyrone, Tirconnell, Geraldine— In vain they fought; in vain they bled: Successive, 'neath th' usurping hand Sank ill-starr'd Mary; erring James: Nor Spain nor France might wield the brand Which, for her own, Religion claims! XI Arise, long stricken! mightier far Are they who fight for God and thee Than those that head the adverse war! Sad prophet! lift thy face and see! Behold, with eyes no longer wrong'd By mists the sense exterior breeds, The hills of heaven around thee throng'd With fiery chariots and with steeds! XII The years baptized in blood are thine; The exile's prayer from many a strand; The woes of those this hour who pine Poor aliens in their native land; Angels and Saints from heaven down-bent Watch thy long conflict without pause; And the most Holy Sacrament From all thine altars pleads thy cause! XIII O great through Suffering, rise at last Through kindred Action tenfold great! Thy future calls on thee thy past Its soul survives to consummate! Let women weep; let children moan: Rise, men and brethren, to the fight: One cause hath Earth, and one alone: For it, the cause of God, unite! XIV Let others trust in trade and traffic! Be ours, O God, to trust in Thee! Cherubic Wisdom, Love Seraphic, Beseem that land the Truth makes free. The earth-quelling sword let others vaunt; Such toys allure the youth, the boy: Be ours for loftier wreaths to pant, The Apostles' crown of Faith and Joy! XV Hope of my country! House of God! All-Hallows! Blessed feet are those By which thy courts shall yet be trod Once more as ere the spoiler rose: Blessed the winds that waft them forth To victory o'er the rough sea foam: That race to God which conquers earth Can God forget that race at home? HYMN. ECCLESIA DEI. I Who is She that stands triumphant Rock in strength upon the Rock, Like some city crown'd with turrets Braving storm and earthquake shock? Who is she her arms extending; Blessing thus a world restored; All the anthems of creation Lifting to creation's Lord? Hers that Kingdom, hers the Sceptre! Fall, ye nations, at her feet! Hers that Truth whose fruit is freedom; Light her yoke; her burden sweet. II As the moon its splendour borrows From a sun unseen all night So from Christ, the Sun of Justice, Draws His Church her sacred light. Touch'd by His her hands have healing, Bread of Life, absolving Key: Christ Incarnate is her Bridegroom; The Spirit hers; His Temple she. Hers the Kingdom, hers the Sceptre! Fall, ye nations, at her feet! Hers that Truth whose fruit is freedom; Light her yoke; her burden sweet! III Empires rise and sink like billows; Vanish and are seen no more; Glorious as the star of morning She o'erlooks their wild uproar: Hers the Household all-embracing, Hers the Vine that shadows earth; Blest thy children, mighty Mother! Safe the stranger at thy hearth. Hers the Kingdom; hers the Sceptre! Fall, ye nations, at her feet! Hers that Truth whose fruit is freedom; Light her yoke; her burden sweet! IV Like her Bridegroom, heavenly, human, Crown'd and militant in one, Chanting Nature's great Assumption And the Abasement of the Son, Her magnificats, her dirges Harmonise the jarring years; Hands that fling to heaven the censer Wipe away the orphan's tears. Hers the Kingdom, hers the Sceptre! Fall, ye nations, at her feet! Hers that Truth whose fruit is freedom; Light her yoke; her burden sweet! ELECTA. I The Hour must come. Long since, and now The shaft decreed is on the wing: Loosed from the Eternal Archer's bow The flying fate shall pierce the ring: The Hour that comes to seal the right; The Hour that comes to judge the wrong; To lift the vales, and thunder-smite Those cliffs the full-gorged eagles throng. II Rejoice, Elect of Isles! Rejoice Pale image of the Church of God! Like her afflicted, lift thy voice Like her, and hail, and hymn the rod! Thou warr'st on earth: at each new groan In heaven thy Guardian claps his hands; And glitters o'er the expectant Throne A crown inwoven of angel bands! SONG. I While autumn flashed from woods of gold Her challenge to the setting sun And storm-clouds, breaking, seaward rolled O'er brightening waves, their passion done, The linnets on a rain-washed beech So thronged I saw not branch for bird: My skill is scant in forest speech But thus they sang or thus I heard. II 'Twas all a dream—the wrong, the strife, The scorn, the blow, the loss, the pain! Immortal Gladness, Love and Life Alone are lords by right and reign: The Earth is tossed about as though Young Angels tossed a cowslip ball; But, rough or level, high or low, What matter? God is all in all. THE CHANGE. I Was it Truth; was it Vision? The old year was dying; Clear rang the last chime from the turret of stone; The mountain hung black o'er the village low-lying; O'er the moon, rushing forward, loose vapours were blown; When I saw an angelical choir with bow'd faces Wafting on, like a bier, upon pinions outspread An angel-like Form that of death had no traces:— Without pain she had died in her sleep; but was dead. II Was it Truth; was it Vision? The darkness was riven; Once more through the infinite breast of pure night From heaven there looked downward, more beauteous than heaven, A visage whose sadness was lost in its light:— ‘Why seek'st thou, my son, 'mid the dead for the living? Thy Country is risen, and lives on in thy Faith; I died but to live; and now, Life and Life-giving, Where'er the Cross triumphs I conquer in death.’ SEMPER EADEM. I The moon, freshly risen from the bosom of ocean, Hangs o'er it suspended, all mournful yet bright; And a yellow sea-circle with yearning emotion Swells up as to meet it, and clings to its light: The orb unabiding grows whiter, mounts higher; The pathos of darkness descends on the brine: O Erin! the North drew its light from thy pyre: Thy light woke the nations; the embers were thine! II Tis sunrise! The mountains flash forth; and, new-redden'd, The billows grow lustrous, so lately forlorn; From the orient with vapours long darken'd and deaden'd The trumpets of Godhead are pealing ‘the Morn!’ He rises, the Sun, in his might re-ascending; Like an altar beneath him lies blazing the sea! O Erin! Who proved thee returns to thee, blending The future and past in one garland for thee! EPILOGUE. With spices and urns they come: ah me, how sorrow can babble! Nothing abides save Love; and to Love comes gladness at last; Sad was the legend yet sweet; though its truth was mingled with fable; Dire was the conflict and long; but the rage of the conflict is past. They are past, the three great Woes; and the days of the dread Desolation; To amethyst changed are the stones blood-stain'd of the temple-floor: A Spiritual Power she lives who seem'd to die as a Nation; Her story is that of a Soul:—and the story of Earth is no more. Endurance it was that won; Suffering, than Action thrice greater; For Suffering humble acts. Away with sigh and with tear! She has gone before you and waits: She has gifts for the blinded who hate her; And that bright Shape by the death-cave in music answers, ‘Not here.’ “THE IRISH SISTERS.” Dedicated TO MY EARLIEST FRIEND AND KINSMAN STEPHEN E. SPRING RICE. THE SISTERS; OR, WEAL IN WOE. First Published in 1861. This Tale, written in happier times, was intended to be the first of a series illustrating the Ireland of the latter day, and especially that side of Irish life and character which is too often ignored, and which remains the hope of Ireland's true friends in her darkest days.—January, 1884. From nine to twelve my guest was eloquent In anger, mixed with sorrow, at the things He saw around us; lands half marsh, half weeds, Gates from the gate-posts miserably divorced, Hovels ill-thatched, wild fences, fissured roads— ‘Your people never for the future plan; They live but for the moment.’ Thus he spake, A youth just entering on his broad domains, A senator in prorogation time Travelling for knowledge, Oxford's accurate scholar, A perfect rider, clean in all his ways, But by traditions narrowed. As the moon Turns but one side to earth, so showed that world Whereon he gazed, for stubborn was his will And Ireland he had never loved. ‘You err’ I answered, taking in good part his wrath, ‘Our peasant too has prescience; far he sees; Earth is his foreground only rough or smooth; In him from seriousness the lightness comes: Too serious is he to make sacrifice For fleeting good; the battles of this world He with the left hand fights and half in sport; He has his moment—and eternity.’ ‘Ay, ay,’ exclaimed my guest, ‘your Church, she does it! Your feasts and fasts and wakes and social rites, With “Sir,” and “Ma'am,” and usages of Court:— I've seen a hundred men leave plough and spade To hale a three weeks' infant to its grave, A cripple pay two shillings for a cart To bear him to the Holy Well. Sick Land! Look up! the proof is round you written large! Your Faith is in the balance wanting found: Your shipless seas confess it; bridgeless streams; Your wasted wealth of ore, and moor, and bay! Beneath the Upas shade of Faith depraved All things lie dead—wealth, comfort, freedom, power; All that great Nations boast!’ ‘Such things,’ I answered, ‘The Gentiles seek; and you new tests have found; “Ecclesiæ stantis vel cadentis,” friend; “Blessed the rich: blessed whom all men praise:” New Scriptures, these; the Irish keep the old! Say, are there not diversities of gifts? Are there not virtues—Industry is one— Which reap on earth, whilst others sow for heaven? Faith, hope, and love, and purity, and patience, Humility, and self-forgetfulness, These too are virtues; yet they rear not States. What then? Of many Nations earth is made: Each has its function; each its part for others: If all were hand, where then were ear or eye? If all were foot, where head? You rail, my friend, Not at my country only but your own. The land that gave us birth our service claims, The suffering land our love. Yet England, too, They love, and they the most, who flatter not. A thousand years of nobleness she lived Whereof you rob her! In this isle are men By ancient lineage hers. Such men might say, “My England was entombed ere yours had birth.” Dates she from Arkwright only? Rose the Nation With Alfred, or those Tudor Kings who built The Golden Gate of England's modern time, But built it upon liberties annulled, Old glories quenched, the old Nobles dead or quelled— Ay, wrecks more sad?’ His host, I could not use Words rough as his albeit to shield a land For every shaft a targe; so changed the theme To her he knew—thence loved. He loved his country; An older man than he for things less great Had loved that land. Yet who could gaze, unmoved, From Windsor's terraced heights o'er those broad meads Lit by the pomp of silver-winding Thames Dropping past templed grove, and hall, and farm, Toward the great City? Who, unthrilled, could mark Her Minsters, towering far away, with heads That stay the sunset of old times; or these, Oxford and Cambridge, England's anchors twain, That to her moorings hold her? Fresh from them Who, who could tread, O Wye, thy watery vale Where Tintern reigns in ruin; who could rest Where Bolton finds in Wharf a warbling choir, Or where the sea-wind fans thy brow discrown'd, Furness, nor love and wonder? Who untouch'd, When evening creeps from Scawfell toward Black Combe, Could wander by thy darkly gleaming lakes Embayed 'mid sylvan garniture and isles From saint or anchoret named, within the embrace Of rural mountains green, or sound, scent, touch, Of kine-besprinkled, soft, partitioned vales Almost domestic? Shadow-haunted land! By Southey's lake Saint Herbert holds his own! The knightly armour now by Yew-dale's crag Rings loud no longer: Grasmere's reddening glass Reflects no more the on-rushing clan: yet still Thy Saxon Kings, and ever-virgin Queens Possess thee with a quiet pathos; still, Like tarnished path forlorn of moon that sets Over wide-watered moor and marsh, thy Past A spiritual sceptre though deposed, extends From sea to sea—from century-worn St. Bees To Cuthbert's tomb under those eastern towers On Durham's bowery steep! He loved his country: That love I honoured. Great and strong he called her: But well I knew that had her greatness waned, His love had waxed. As thus we talk'd the sun Launched through the hurrying clouds a rainy beam That smote the hills. My guest exclaimed, ‘Come forth: We waste the day! Yon ridge my fancy takes; Climb we its crest!’ The wolf-hound at our feet Our drift divining, bounded sudden on us In rapture of prospective gratitude. We passed the offending gate; a plank for bridge We passed the offending stream which dashed its spray Contemptuous on us, proud of liberty. I laughed; ‘Our passionate Ireland is the stream; Seven hundred years at will it mocks or chides; You have not made it turn your English mill?’ We scaled the hills; we pushed through miles of trees Which, sire and son, had held their own since first The tall elk trod their ways. Lightning and storm Had left large wrecks: election wars, not less, Or hospitalities as fierce, when home A thousand chiefless clansmen dragged the bride, Or danced around a cradle,—ah, brave hearts! Loyal where cause for loyalty was scant! Vast were those woods and fair; rock, oak, and yew, Grey, green, and black, in varying measures striking That three-stringed lyre which charms not ear but eye. Long climbing, from the woodland we emerged And paced a rocky neck of pale green pasture The limit of two counties. Full in face Rushed, ocean-scented, the harmonic wind: Round us the sheep-bells chimed; a shower late past With jewelry had hung the blackberry bush, And gorse-brake half in gold. On either side Thin-skinned, ascetic, slippery, the descent Down slanted toward the creeping mists. Our goal We reached at last—a broad and rocky mass Forth leaning lordly unto lands remote The lion's head of all those feebler hills That cowering slunk behind it. Far around Low down, subjected, stretched the sea-like waste Shade-swept, unbounded, like infinity. An hour before his time the sun had dropped Behind a mountain-wall of barrier cloud Wide as the world: but five great beams converged Toward the invisible seat of his eclipse; And over many a river, bay, and mere Lay the dull red of ante-dated eve. That summit was a churchyard. Cross-engraven Thronged the close tomb-stones. Each one prayed for peace; And some were raised by men whose heads were white Ere selfless toil had won the hoarded coins That honoured thus a parent. In the midst A tomb-like chapel, thirty feet by ten, Stood monumental with stone roof and walls The wrestling centuries slid from. Nigh we sat While, by the polished angle split, the wind Hissed like a forkèd serpent. Silent long My friend remain'd; his sallies all had ceased, A man of tender nerve though stubborn thought. The scene weighed on him like a Prophet's scroll Troubling some unjust City. Far and near He scanned the desolate region, and at last Prayed me the hieroglyphic to expound. ‘Yon tower which blurs the lonely lake far off, What is it?’ And I answered, ‘Know you not? He built it, he that Norman horsed and mailed, Who, strong in Henry's might and Adrian's bull, Rent from the Gaelic monarch half his realm; The rest came later, dowry of the bride.’ Once more he mused; then, westward pointing, spake: ‘Yon lovely hills, yet low, with Phidian line That melts into the horizon:—on their curve A ruined castle stands; the sky glares through it, Red, like a conflagration?’ I replied: ‘Four hundred years the Norman held his own: He spake the people's language; they in turn His war-cry had resounded far and wide; Their history he had grown impersonate, The land rejoiced in him, and of his greatness Uplifted, glorying, on a neck high held The beautiful burden, as the wild stag lifts O'er rocky Torc his antlers! Would you more? The Desmond was unloved beside the Thames; The right of the great Palatine was trampled; His Faith by law proscribed. O'er tombs defaced, In old Askeaton's Abbey, of his sires He vowed unwilling war. Long years the realm Reel'd like a drunken man. Behold the end! Yon wreck speaks all!’ Thus question after question Dragged, maimed and mangled, dragged reluctant forth Time's dread confession! Crime replied to crime: Whom Tudor planted Cromwell rooted out; For Charles they fought;—to fight for Kings, their spoilers, The rebel named rebellion! William next! Once more the Nobles were down hurled; once more Nobility as in commission placed By God among the lowly. Loyalty To native Princes, or to Norman chiefs Their lawless conquerors, or to British Kings, Or her the Mother Church that ne'er betrayed, Had met the same reward. The legend spake Words few but plain, grim rubric traced in blood; While, like a Fury fleeting through the air, History from all the octaves of her lyre Struck but one note! What rifted tower and keep Witnessed of tyrannous and relentless wars, That shipless gulfs, that bridgeless streams and moors, Black as if lightning-scarred, or banned of God, Proclaimed of laws blacker than brand or blight— Those Penal Laws. The tale was none of mine; Stone railed at stone; grey ruins dumbly frowned Defiance, and the ruin-handled blast Scattered the fragments of Cassandra's curse From the far mountains to the tombs close by Which muttered treason. That sad scene to me Had lost by use its pathos as the scent That thrills us while we pass the garden palls On one within it tarrying. To my friend It spake its natural language: and as he Who, hard through habit, reads with voice unmoved A ballad that once touched him, if perchance Some listener weeps, partakes that listener's trouble Even so the stranger's sorrow struck on mine, And I believed the things which I beheld, There sitting silent. When at last he spake The spirit of the man in part was changed; The things but heard of he had seen: the truths Coldly conceded now he realized: Justice at last with terrible recoil Leap'd up full-armed, a strong man after sleep, And dashed itself against the wrong! I answered: ‘Once more you speak the words you spake this morn, “Look up, the proof is round you written large:” But in an altered sense.’ I spake, and left him: Left him to seek a tomb which three long years Holds one I honoured. Half an hour went by; Then he rejoined me. With a knitted brow, And clear vindictiveness of speech, like him Who, loving, hates the sin of whom he loves, He spake against the men who, having won By right or wrong the mastery of this isle (For in our annals he was versed, nor ran In custom's blinkers save on modern roads), Could make of it, seven hundred years gone by, No more than this! Then I: ‘No country loved they: Her least, the imperial realm! 'Tis late to mourn; Let past be past.’ ‘The Past,’ he said ‘is present; And o'er the Future stretches far a hand Shadowy and minatory.’ ‘Come what may,’ I said, ‘no pang to Ireland can be new; No shadow fail to dew some soul with grace. The history of a Soul holds in it more Than doth a Nation's! In its every chance Eternity lies hid; from every step Branch forth two paths piercing infinity. These things look noblest from their spiritual side: A statesman, on the secular side you see them, And doubt a future based on such a past. 'Tis true, with wrong dies not the effect of wrong, Or sense thereof: 'tis true stern Power with time Changes its modes, not instinct: true it is That hollow peace is war that wears a mask: Yet let us quell to-day unquiet thoughts: She rests who lies in yonder tomb: sore pains She suffered: yet within her there was peace: In God's high Will she rests; and why not we?’ Thus we conversed till twilight, thickening, crept Compassionate, o'er a scene to which we said Twilight seemed native, day a garish vest Worn by a slave. Returning, oft my friend Cast loose in wrath the arch-rebel Truth; I answered: ‘She rests; and why not we? O suffering land! Thee, too, God shields; and only for this cause Can they that love thee sleep.’— Holy were all as she, the wrongs long past Would rack our age no longer: for that cause The blinder they who mock her country's Faith. Thousands are like her! Ireland's undergrowths— Her hope is there, and not in cloud or sunshine That beat her mountain-tops. The maiden's tale He sought with instance. 'Twas not marvellous, I told him: yet to calm his thoughts perturbed, Thus, while the broad moon o'er the lonely moor Rose, blanching as she soared, till pools, at first With trembling light o'erlaid, gave back her face, And all the woodland waves as eve advanced Shone bright o'er sombre hollows, I recounted The fragments of a noteless Irish life, Not strange esteemed among us. Such a theme I sought not. Ill it were to forge for friend A providence, or snare him though to Truth. Yet I was pleased he sought that tale. 'Twas sad But in its dusky glass—and this I hid not— Shadowed a phantom image of my country, Vanquished yet victor, in her Weal and Woe. The father in the prime of manhood died; The mother followed soon; their children twain, Margaret Mac Carthy, and her sister Mary, The eldest scarcely ten years old, survived To spread cold hands upon a close-sealed grave, And cry to those who answered not. The man Who, in that narrow spot to them the world, Stood up and seemed as God; that gentler one Who overhung like Heaven their earliest thought, And in the bosom of whose sleepless love Reborn they seemed each morning, both were dead. In grief's bewilderment the orphans stood Like one by fraud betrayed: nor moon, nor sun, Nor trees, nor grass, nor herds, nor hills appeared To them what they had been. In saddened eyes, Frightened yet dull, in voice subdued, and feet That moved as though they feared to wake the dead, Men saw that nowhere loneliness more lives Than in the breasts of children. Time went by; The farm was lost; and to her own small home Their father's mother led them. 'Twas not far; They still could see the orchard they had loved; Behind the hedge could hear the robin sing, And the bees murmur. Slowly, as the trance Of grief dissolved, the present lived once more; The past became a dream! I see them still! Softly the beauty-making years on went, And each one as he passed our planet's verge Looked back, and left a gift. A darker shade Dropped on the deepening hair; a brighter gleam Forth flashed from sea-blue eyes with darkness fringed. Like, each to each, their stature growing kept Unchanged gradation. To her grandmother A quick eye and a serviceable hand Endeared the elder most; she kept the house; Hers was the rosier cheek, the livelier mind, The smile of readier cheer. In Mary lived A visionary and pathetic grace Through all her form diffused, from those small feet Up to that beauteous-shaped and netted head, Which from the slender shoulders and slight bust Rose like a queen's. Alone, not solitary, Full often half an autumn day she sat On the high grass-banks, foot with foot enclasped, Now twisting osiers, watching cloud-shades now, Or rushing vapours through whose chasms there shone Far off an alien race of clouds like Alps O'er Courmayeur white-gleaming, and like them To stillness frozen. Well that orphan knew them, Those marvellous clouds that roof our Irish wastes; Spring's lightsome veil outblown, sad Autumn's bier, And Winter's pillar of electric light Slanted from heaven. A spirit-world, so seemed it, In them was imaged forth to her. With us The childish heart betroths itself full oft In vehement friendship. Mary's was of these; And thus her fancy found that counterweight Which kept her feet on earth. With her there walked Two years a little maiden of the place, Her comrade, as men called her. Eve by eve Homeward from school we saw them as they passed, One arm of each about the other's neck, Above both heads a single cloak. She died, To Mary leaving what she valued most, A rosary strung with beads from Olivet. Daily did Mary count those beads; from each The picture of some Christian Truth ascending, Till all the radiant Mysteries shone on high Like constellations, and man's gloomy life For her to music rolled on poles of love Through realms of glory. Hope makes Love immortal! That friend she ne'er forgot. In later years Working with other maidens equal-aged, (A lady of the land instructed them,) In circle on the grass, not them she saw, Heard not the song they sang: alone she sat, And heard 'mid sighing pines and murmuring streams The voice of the departed. Smoothly flowed Till Margaret had attained her eighteenth year The tenor of their lives; and they became, Those sisters twain, a name in all the vale For beauty, kindness, truth, for modest grace, And all that makes that fairest flower of all Earth bears, heaven fosters—peasant nobleness:— For industry the elder. Mary failed In this, a dreamer; indolence her fault, And self-indulgence, not that coarser sort Which seeks delight, but that which shuns annoy. And yet she did her best. The dull red morn Shone, beamless, through the wintry hedge while passed That pair with panniers, or, on whitest brows The balanced milk-pails. Margaret ruled serene A wire-fenced empire smiling through soft glooms, The pure, health-breathing dairy. Softer hand Than Mary's ne'er let loose the wool; no eye Finer pursued the on-flowing line: her wheel Murmured complacent joy like kitten pleased: With us such days abide not. Sudden fell Famine, the Terror never absent long, Upon our land. It shrank—the daily dole; The oatmeal trickled from a tighter grasp; Hunger grew wild through panic; infant cries Maddened at times the gentle into wrong: Death's gentleness more oft for death made way; And like a lamb that openeth not its mouth The sacrificial People, fillet-bound, Stood up to die. Amid inviolate herds Not few the sacraments of death received, Then waited God's decree. These things are known: Strangers have witness'd to them; strangers writ The epitaph again and yet again: The nettles and the weeds by the way-side Men ate: from sharpening features and sunk eyes Hunger glared forth, a wolf more lean each hour; Children seemed pigmies shrivelled to sudden age; And the deserted babe too weak to wail But shook if hands, pitying or curious, raised The rag across him thrown. In England alms From many a private hearth were largely sent, As ofttimes they have been. 'Twas vain. The land Wept while her sons sank back into her graves Like drowners 'mid still seas. Who could escaped: And on a ghost-thronged deck, amid such cries As from the battle-field ascend at night When stumbling widows grope o'er heaps of slain, Amid such cries stood Mary, when the ship Its cable slipped and, on the populous quays Grating, without a wind, on the slow tide, Dropped downward to the main. For western shores Those emigrants were bound. At Liverpool, Fann'd by the ocean breeze the smouldering fire Of fever burst into a sudden flame; The stricken there were left; among them Mary. How long she knew not in an hospital, A Babel of confused distress, she lay, Dinned with delirious strife. But o'er her brow God shook the dew of dreams wherein she trod The shadowed wood-walks of old days once more, And dabbled in old streams. Ere long, still weak, Abroad she roamed, a basket on her arm, With violets heaped. The watchman of the city Laid his strong hand upon her drooping head Banning the impostor. 'Twas her rags, she thought, Incensed him, and in meekness moved she on. When one with lubrique smile toyed with her flowers, And spake of violet eyes and easier life, She understood not, but misliked, and passed. In Liverpool an aged priest she found, A kinsman of her mother's. Much to her Of emigrants he spake, and of their trials, Old ties annull'd, and 'mid temptations strange Lacking full oft the Bread of Life. She wept; Before the tabernacle's lamp she prayed Freshly-absolved and heavenliest, with prayer That showered God's blessing o'er the wanderers down: But dead was her desire to cross the main. Her strength restored, beyond the city-bound With others of her nation she abode, Amid the gardens labouring. A rough clan Those outcasts seemed: not like their race at home: Nor chapel theirs, nor school. Their strength was prized; Themselves were so esteemed as that sad tribe Beside the Babylonian streams that wept, By those that loved not Sion. Weeks grew months; And, with the strength to suffer, sorrow came. Hard by their nomad camp a youth there lived Of wealthier sort, who looked upon this maid: Her country was his own: he loved it not: Had rooted quickly in the stranger's land; And versatile, cordial, specious, seeming-frank, Contracting for himself a separate peace, Had prosper'd, but had prospered in such sort As they that starve within. Her confidence He gained. To love unworthy, still he loved her: Loved with the love of an unloving heart, That love which either is in shallows lost, Or in its black depth breeds the poison weed. She knew him not; how could she? He himself Knew scantly. Near her what was best within him Her golden smile sunned forth; but, dark and cold, Like a benighted hemisphere abode A moiety of his being which she saw not. His was a superficial nature, vain, And hard, to good impressions sensitive, And most admiring virtues least his own; A mirror that took in a seeming world, And yet remained blank surface. He was crafty, Followed the plough with diplomatic heart; His acts were still like the knight's move at chess, Each a surprise; not less, to nature's self Who heard him still referr'd them. ‘What!’ men said, ‘Marry the portionless!’ Strange are fortune's freaks! The wedding-day was fixed, the ring brought home, When from a distant uncle tidings came: His latest son was dead. ‘Take thou my farm, And share my house’—So spake the stern old man— ‘And wed the wife whom I for thee have found.’ He showed the maid that letter. Slowly the weeds Made way adown the thick and stifled stream, And others followed; slowly sailed the cloud Through the dull sky, and others followed slowly: At last he spake. Low were his words and thin, Many, but scarcely heard. He asked—her counsel! Her cheek one moment burned. Death-cold, once more A little while she sat; then rose and said; ‘You would be free; I free you; go in peace.’ 'Twas the good angel in his heart that loved her; 'Twas not the man himself! He wept, but went. The woman of the house that night was sure The girl had loved him not. She thought not so When, four months past, she mark'd her mouth, aside, Tremble, his name but uttered. Sharp the wrong! Yet they on Life's bewildered book would force A partial gloss it bears not who assume The injured wholly free from blame. The world Is not a board in squares of black and white, Or else the judgment-executing tongue Would lack probation. Wronged men are not angels; Wrong's chiefest sin is this—it genders wrong; So stands the offender in his own esteem Exculpate; while the feebly-judging starve The just cause, babbling ‘mutual was the offence!’ The man was weak; not wholly vile. 'Twas well, Doubtless, to free him; yet in after years, When early blight had struck his radiant head, The girl bewailed the pride that left thus tempted The man she loved; arraigned the wrath that left him Almost without farewell. His letter too, Unopen'd she returned. 'Twas strange! so sweet— Not less there lived within her, down, far down, A fire-spring seldom wakened! When a child, At times, by some strange jealousy disturbed From her still dream she flashed in passion quelled Ere from her staider sister's large blue eyes The astonishment had passed. Such moods remained Though rare—that wrath of tender hearts, which scorns Revenge, which scarcely utters its complaint, And yet forgives but slowly. In those days Within the maiden's bosom there arose Sea-longings, and desire to sail away She knew not whither; and her arms she spread, Weeping, to winds and waves, and shores unknown, Lighted by other skies; and inly thus She reasoned self-deceived. ‘What keeps thee here? 'Twas for a farther bourne thou bad'st farewell To those at home, and here thou art as one That hangs between two callings.’ In her heart Tempests low-toned to ocean-tempests yearned, And ever when she marked the shipmast forest That on the smoky river swayed far off, Her wish became a craving. Soon once more Alone 'mid hundreds on a rain-washed deck She stood, and saw the billows heave around And all the passions of that headlong world. Dark-visaged ocean frowned with hoary brows Against dark skies; huge, lumbering water-weights Went shouldering through the abysses: streaming clouds Ran on the lower levels of the wind; And in the universe of things she seemed An atom random blown. Full many a morn Rose red through mists, like babe that weeps to rise; Full many an evening died from wave to wave; Then gradual peace possessed her. Love may wound But 'tis self-love exasperates that wound; A noble nature casts out bitterness, And o'er the scar, like pine-tree incorrupt, Weeps healing gums. Heart-whole she gazed at last, On the great city chiefest of that realm Which wears the Future's glory. Landed, soon Back to old duties with a mightier zest Her heart, its weakening sadness passed, returned: Kindness made service easier, and the tasks At first distasteful smiled on her ere long: There she was loved once more; there all went well And there in peace she might have lived and died; Yet in that region she abode not long: In part a wayward instinct drave her forth; In part a will that from the accomplished end Unstable swerved; in part a hope forlorn: She sought a site their sojourn who had left Long since her native village. Thence old names, Faces unknown, yet recognized, thronged round her In unconsummate union, (hearts still like, Yet all beside so different,) not like Souls Re-met in heaven—more like those Shades antique That, 'mid the empurpled fields, of other airs Mindful, in silence trod the Elysian land, Or flocked around the latest guest of Death With question sad of home. Imperfect ties Rub severance into soreness. Mary passed, Thus urged, ere long to lonelier climes: she tracked Companioned sometimes, sometimes without friend, The boundless prairie, sailed the sea-like lake, Descended the broad river as it rushed Through immemorial forests: lastly stood Sole, 'mid that city by the southern sea. There sickness fell upon her: there her hand Dropt, heavier daily, on her task half done; Her feet wore chains unseen. The end, she thought, Was coming. Ofttimes, in her happier days, She wished to die and be with God: yet now, Wearied by many griefs, to life she clung, Upbraiding things foregone and inly sighing ‘None loves to die.’ Sorrow, earth-born, in some Breeds first the Earth-infection; in them works, Like those pomegranate seeds that barred from light For aye sad Ceres' child! Alas! how many, The ill-honoured ecstasies of youth surceased, Exchange its clear spring for the mire! Hope sick, How oft Faith dies! How few are they in whom Virgin but yields to Vestal; casual pureness Merged in essential; childhood's matin dew Fixed, ere exhaled, in the Soul's adamant! Mary with these had part; to her help came, That help the proud despise. One eve it chanced Upon the vast and dusking quays she stood Alone and weeping. She that morn had sent Her latest hoardings to her grandmother, And half was sorry she had naught retained: The warm rain wet her hair: she heard within The silver ringing of its drops commingling With that still mere beside her childhood's home, And with the tawny sedge that girt it round, And with its winter dogwood far away Reddening the faint, still gleam. As thus she stood Upon her shoulder sank a hand. She turned: It was a noble lady clothed in black, And veiled. That veil thrown back, she recognized At once the luminous stillness and the calm Ethereal which the sacred cloister breeds. A voice as pure and sweet as if from heaven, Toned as friend speaks to friend, addressed her thus: ‘You lack a home: our convent is hard by.’ The lady, Spanish half, and Irish half, No answer sought, but with compulsion soft Drew her, magnetic, as the tree hard by Draws the poor creeper on the ground diffused, And lifts it into light. The child's cold hand Lurked soon in hers: and in that home which seemed An isle of heaven she lived a meek lay sister, Ere long by healthier airs to strength restored, A rapturous life of Christian freedom masked In what but servitude had been to one Lacking vocation true. The Life Divine, ‘Hidden with God,’ is hidden from the world Lest Virtue should be dimmed by Virtue's praise. Heroic Virtue least by men is prized: The hero in the Saint the crowd can honour, The Saint at best forgive. To this world's ken Convents, of sanctity chief citadels, Though sanctity in every place is found, The snowy banners and bright oriflambs Of that resplendent realm by Counsels ruled Not Precept only, spread in vain, despised Or for their earthly good alone revered Not for their claims celestial. Different far The lesson Mary learned. The poor were fed, The orphan nursed; around the sick man's couch Gentle as light hovered the healing hand; And beautiful seemed on mountain-tops of Truth, The foot that brought good tidings! Times of trial To Sabbaths changed; and many a rude, rough girl, Waiting another service, found a home Where that which years had marred returned once more Like infant flesh clothing the leprous limb. Yet these things Mary found were blossoms only: The tree's deep root was secret. From the Vow Which bound the Will's infinitude to God Upwelled that peaceful strength whose fount was God: From Him behind His sacramental veil In holy passion for long hours adored Came that great Love which made the bonds of earth Needless, thence irksome. Wondering, there she learned The creature was not for the creature made But for the sole Creator; that His kingdom, Glorious hereafter, lies around us here, Its visible splendour painfully suppressing, And waiting its transfigurance. Was it strange If while those Brides of Christ around her moved Her heart sang hymns to God? Much had she suffered: Much of her suffering gladly there she learned Came of her fault; and much had kindliest ends Not yet in her fulfilled. A light o'ershone her Which slays Illusion, that white snake which slimes The labyrinth of self-love's more tender ways Virtue's most specious mimic. She was loosed: The actual by the seeming thraldom slain; Her life was from within and from above; And as, when Winter dies and Spring new-born Her whisper breathes o'er earth, the earlier flowers— Unlike the wine-dark growths of Autumn dipped In the year's sunset—rise in lightest hues An astral gleam, white, green, or delicate yellow More light than colour, so the maiden's thoughts Flashed with a radiance that permitted scarce Human affections tragic. Oft, she told me, As faithless to old friends she blamed herself: One hand touched Calvary, one the Eternal Gates; The present nothing seemed. The years passed on: The honeymoon of this heart-bridal waned; But nothing of its spousal truth was lost, Nor of its serious joy. If failures came— And much she marvelled at her slow advance, And for the first time, pierced by that stern grace Wherein no sin looks trivial, feared;—what then? Failures that deepened humbleness but sank Foundations deeper for a loftier pile Of virtue: transports homeward heavenward summoned For more disinterested love made way, More perfect made Obedience. If a Soul, Half-way to heaven, death past, once more to earth Were sent, it could but feel as Mary felt When on the convent grates a letter smote Loud, harsh, with summons from the outward world. Her sister, such its tidings, was a wife, (That matron whom you praised:—ay, comely is she, And good; laborious, kindly, faithful, true; Yet Time has done Time's work, her spiritual beauty Transposing gently to a lower key;) Her grandmother bereft, and weak through age, Needed her tendance. Would the younger come? Alas! what could she? Duty stretched from far An iron hand that stayed her mounting steps; The little novices wept loud, ‘Abide!’ Long on her neck the saintly sisterhood Hung ere they blessed her: then she turned and went. And so once more she trod this rocky vale, And scarcely older looked at twenty-six Than at sixteen. Before so gentle, now A humbler gentleness was o'er her thrown; Nor ruffled was she ever as of yore With gusts of flying spleen: nor feared she now Hindrance unlovely, or the word that jarred. The sadness hers at first dispers'd ere long, And such strange sweetness came to her, men said A mad dog would not bite her. Lowliest toils Were by her hand ennobled: Labour's staff Beneath it burst in blossom. In the garden, 'Mid earliest birds, and singing like a bird, She moved, her grandmother asleep. She mixed The reverence due to years with tenderness The infant's claim. 'Twas hers to bring the crutch, Nor mark the lameness; hers with question apt To prompt, not task, the memory. Tales twice-told Wearied not her, nor orders each with each At odds, nor causeless blame. Wiles she had many To anticipate harsh moods, lest one rash word Might draw a cloud 'twixt helpless eld and heaven, Blotting the Eternal Vision felt not seen By hearts in grace. With works of gay caprice Needless—yet prized—she made the spectre Want Seem farther off. Thus love in narrow space Built a great world. The grandmother preferred To her, that dreamful girl of old, the woman Who from the mystic precinct first had learned Humanity, yet seemed a human creature O'erruled by some angelic guest. At heart Ever a nun, she ministered with looks That healed the sick. The newly-widowed door Its gloom remitted when she passed; grey foes Downtrod their legend of old wrongs. To her Sacred were those that grieved;—those tearless yet Sacred scarce less because they smiled nor knew The ambushed fate before them. When a child, Grey-haired companionship or solitude Had pleased her more than childish mates; but now All the long eves of summer in the porch The children of her sister and the neighbours A spotless flock, sat round her. From her smiles The sluggish mind caught light, the timid heart Courage and strength. Unconscious thus, each day Her soft and blithesome feet one letter traced In God's gold Book above. So passed her life;— Sorrow had o'er it hung a gentle cloud; But, like an autumn-mocking day in Spring Dewy and dim yet ending in pure glory, The sweets were sweeter for the rain, the growth Stronger for shadow. You have seen her tomb! Upon the young and beautiful it closed: Her grandmother yet lingers! What is Time? Shut out the sun, and all the summer long The fruit-tree stands as barren as the rock; May's offering March can bring us. Of the twain The younger doubtless in the eyes of God Had inly lived the longest. She had learned From action much, from suffering more, far more, For Earth-experience is a sword whose point Makes way for Truth. Her trials, great and little, And trials ever keep proportion just With high vocations and the spirit's growth, Had done their work till all her inner being, Freed from asperities, in the light of God Shone like the feet of some old crucifix Kissed into smoothness. Here I fain would end, Leaving her harboured; but her stern, kind fates Not thus forewent her. Like her life her death, Not negative or neutral; great in pains, In consolations greater. Many a week Much ailed her; what the cause remained in doubt; When certainty had come she trembled not: Fixed was her heart. Those pangs that shook her frame Like tempests roaring round a mountain church Shook not that peace within her! She was thankful; ‘More pain if such Thy Will, and patience more,’ This was her prayer; or wiping from moist eyes The trembling tear, she whispered, ‘Give me, Lord, On earth Thy cleansing fire that I may see Sooner Thy Face, death past!’ Alleviations, Many and great, God granted her. Once more Her sister was her sister! Unlike fortunes Had placed at angles those two lives that once Basked side by side; and love that could not die Had seemed to sleep. It woke: and, as from mist, Once more shone out their childhood! Laughed and flashed Once more the garden-beds whose bright accost Had cheered them for their parents mourning. Tears Remembered stayed the course of later tears; The prosperous from the unprosperous sister sought Heart-peace; nor wealth nor care could part them more; And sometimes Margaret's children seemed to her As children of another! Greetings sweet Cheered her from distant regions. Once it chanced The nuns a relic sent her ne'er before Seen in our vales, a fragment of that Cross Whereon the world's Redeemer hung three hours: The neighbours entering knelt and wept, and smote Their breasts; her hands she raised in prayer; and straight Such Love, such Reverence in her heart, there rose Her anguish, like a fiend exorcised, fled; And for an hour at peace she lay as one Imparadised. A solace too was hers Known but to babes. Her body, not her mind, Was racked; the pang to come she little feared, Nor lengthened out morose the pang foregone; Once o'er, to sleep she sank in thankful prayer. A week ere Mary died all suffering left her; And from the realms of glory beams, as though Further restraint they brooked not, fell on her Yet militant below, as there she lay In monumental whiteness, spirit-lit. The anthems of her convent charmed once more Her dreams; and scents from woods where she had sat In tears. Oft spake she of her wandering days; Herself she scarcely seemed to see in them; Plainly thus much I saw: When all went well, Danger stood nigh; but soon as sorrow came Within that darkness nearer by her side Walked her good Angel. In that latest week Some treasures hidden ever near her heart She showed me—faded flowers; her mother's hair; Gold pieces that have raised our chapel's Cross; A riband by her youthful comrade worn: Upon its cover some few words I found There traced when first beyond the western main She heard the homeless cuckoo's cry well-known: ‘When will my People to their land return?’ From the first hour her grandchild sank, once more She that for years bed-ridden lay had risen, And, autumn past, put forth a wintry strength, Ministering. Her frame was stronger than her mind; O'er that at times a dimness hung, like cloud That creeps from pine to pine. Inly she missed Her wonted place of homage lost; she mused Sadly upon the solitary future; But in her there abode a rock-like will, And from her tearless service night or day No man might push her. Seldom spake the woman: She called her grandchild by her daughter's name, Her daughter buried thirty years and more, And once she said in wrath, ‘Why toil they thus Nora is dead.’ She laboured till the end: It came—that mortal close! 'Twas Christmas Eve; Far, far away were heard the city bells: The sufferer slept. At midnight I went forth; Along the ice-filmed road a dull gleam lay, And a sepulchral wind in woods far off Sang dirges deep. Upon her crutches bent The aged woman stood beside the door, With that long gaze intense which is an act Silently looking toward that hill of graves We trod this day; a sinking moon shone o'er it: Then whispered she—the light of buried years Edging once more her eyes—‘Each Saturday, Of those that in that churchyard sleep three Souls, Their penance done, ascend, and are with God.’ Thus as she spake a cry was heard within, And many voices raised the Litany For a departing Soul. Long time—too long— Had seemed that dying! Now the hour was come And change ineffable announced that Death At last was standing on the floor. O hour! When in brief space our life is lived again! Down cast its latest stake! when fiends ascend, Beckoning the phantoms of forgotten wrong Conscience to scare, or launching as from slings Temptations new; while Angels hold before us The Cross unshaken as the sun in heaven, And whisper, ‘Christ.’ O hour! when prayer is all; And they that clasp the hand are drawn apart By the world's breadth from that they love! The act Sin's dread bequest that makes an end of sinning, Long lasted, while the heart-strings snapt, and all The elements of the wondrous sensuous world Slid from the fading sense, and those poor fingers, As the loose precipice of life down crumbled, Plucked as at roots. Storm-winged the hours rushed by; There lay she like some bark on midnight seas Now toiling through the windless vale, anon Hurled on and up to meet the implacable blast Upon the rolling ridge, when not a foot Can tread the decks, and all the sobbing planks Tremble o'erspent. The morning dawned at last Whitening the frosty pane; the lights removed, Save that tall candle in her hand sustained By others, she descried it: ‘Ah!’ she said, ‘Thank God! another day!’ Then, noting one Who near her knelt, she said ‘The night is sped And you have had no sleep; alas! I thought Ere midnight I should die.’ Her eyelids closed; Into a sleep as quiet as a babe's Gradual she sank; and while the ascending sun Shot 'gainst the western hill his earliest beam, In sleep, without a sigh, her spirit passed. I would you could have seen her face in death! I would you could have heard that last dread rite, The mighty Mother's, o'er the stormy gulf And all the moanings of the unknown abyss Flinging victorious anthems or the strength Of piercing prayer: ‘Oh! ye at least, my friends, Have pity on me! plead for me with God!’ That Rite complete, the dark procession wound Interminably through the fields and farms, While wailing like a midnight wind, the keen Expired o'er moor and heath. At eve we reached The graveyard; slowly, as to-day, the sun Behind a tomb-like bank of leaden cloud Dropt while the coffin sank, and died away The latest Miserere— More than once I would have ceased; but he, my friend and guest, Or touched or courteous, willed me to proceed. Perhaps that tale the wild scene harmonized By sympathy occult; perhaps it touched him, Contrasting with his recent life—with England, With Oxford, long his home; its ordered pomp; Its intermingled groves, and fields, and spires, Its bridges spanning waters calm and clear; The frequentation of its courts; its chimes; Its sunset towers, and strangely youthful gardens That breathe the ardours of the budding year On the hoar breadth of grove-like cloisters old, Chapels, and libraries, and statued halls, England's still saintly City! Time has there A stone tradition built like that all round Woven by the inviolate hedges, where the bird Her nest has made and warbled to her young, May after May secure, since the third Edward Held his last tournament, and Chaucer sang To Blanche and to Philippa lays of love— Not like Iernian records. Sad we rose, That tale complete; and, after silence long, As homeward through the braided forest-skirt We trod the moonlight-spotted rocks, my friend Resumed, with pregnant matter oft more just In thought than application; yet his voice Was softer than it wont to be. At last, After our home attained, we turned, and lo! With festal fires the hills were lit! Thine eve, Saint John, had come once more; and for thy sake, As though but yesterday thy crown was won, Amid their ruinous realm uncomforted The Irish people triumphed. Gloomy lay The intermediate space: thence brightlier burned The circling fires beyond it. ‘Lo!’ said I, ‘Man's life as viewed by Ireland's sons; a vale With many a pitfall throng'd, and shade, and briar, Yet over-blown by angel-haunted airs, And by the Light Eternal girdled round.’ Brief supper passed, within the porch we sat As fire by fire burned low. We spake; were mute; Resumed; but our discourse was gently toned, Touched by a spirit from that wind-beaten grave, Which breathed among its pauses, as of old That converse Bede records, when by the sea, 'Twixt Tyne and Wear, facing towards Lindisfarne, Saxon Ceolfrid and his Irish guest, Evangelist from old Iona's isle, 'Mid the half Pagan land in cloisters dim Discuss'd the Tonsure, and the Paschal time, Sole themes whereon, in sacred doctrine one, They differed; but discussed them in such sort That mutual reverence deeper grew. We heard The bridgeless brook that sang far off, and sang Alone: for not among us builds that bird Which changes light to music, haply ill-pleased That Ireland bears not yet, in song's domain To Spenser worthy fruit. Our beds at last, Wearied, yet glad, we sought. Ere long the wind, Gathering its manifold voices and the might Of all its wills in valleys far, and rolled From wood to wood o'er ridge and ravine, woke Those Spectres which o'erhang my sleep in storm, A hundred hills to me by sound well known, That stand dark clustered in the night, and bend With rainy skirt o'er lake and prone morass, Or by sea-bays lean out procumbent brows, Waiting the rising sun. At morn we met Once more, my friend and I. The evening's glow Had from his feelings passed: in their old channels They flowed, scarce tinged. But still his thoughts retained The trace of late impressions quaintly linked With kindred thought-notes earlier. Half his mind Scholastic was; his fancy deep: the age Alone had stamped him modern. Much he spake Of England wise and wealthy—now no more, He said, ‘a haughty nation proud in arms,’ Nor, as in Saxon times, a crownèd child Propped 'gainst the Church's knee; but Ocean's Queen, Spanning the world with golden zone twin-clasped By Commerce and by Freedom! But no less Of pride and suffering spake he, and that frown Sun-pressed on brows once pure. Of Ireland next: ‘How strange a race, more apt to fly than walk; Soaring yet slight; missing the good things round them, Yet ever out of ashes raking gems; In instincts loyal, yet respecting law Far less than usage: changeful, yet unchanged! Timid, yet enterprising: frank, yet secret: Untruthful oft in speech, yet living truth, And Truth in things divine to life preferring:— Scarce men; yet possible angels! “Isle of Saints!” Such doubtless was your land—again it might be— Strong, prosperous, manly never! ye are Greeks In intellect, and Hebrews in the soul: The solid Roman heart, the corporate strength Is England's dower!’ ‘Unequally if so,’ I said, ‘in your esteem the Isles are matched:— They live in distant ages, alien climes; Native they are to diverse elements: Our swan walks awkwardly upon dry land; Your boasted strength in spiritual needs so helps you As armour helps the knight who swims a flood.’ He laughed. ‘At least nor siren streams for us, Nor holy wells! We love “the fat of the land,” Meads such as Rubens painted! Strange our fates! Our feast is still the feast of fox and stork, The platter broad, and amphora long-necked;— Ill-sorted yoke-mates truly. Strength, meanwhile, Lords it o'er weakness!’ ‘Never yet,’ I answered, ‘Was husband vassal to an intricate wife But roared he ruled her;’ ere his smile had ceased, Continuing thus:—‘Ay! strength o'er weakness rules! Strength hath in this no choice. But what is Strength? Two Strengths there are. Club-lifting Hercules, A mountained mass of gnarled and knotted sinews, How shows he near the intense, Phœbean Might That, godlike, spurns the ostent of thews o'ergrown; That sees far off the victory fixed and sure, And, without effort, wings the divine death Like light, into the Python's heart? My friend, Justice is strength; union on justice built:— Good-will is strength—kind words—silence—that truth Which hurls no random charge. Your scribes long time Blow on our island like a scythèd wind: The good they see not, nor the cause of ill; They tear the bandage from the wound half-healed:— Is not such onset weakness? Were it better, Tell me, free-trader staunch, for sister Nations To make exchange for aye of scorn for scorn, Or blend the nobler powers and aims of each, Diverse, and for that cause correlative, True commerce, noblest, holiest, frankest, best, And breed at last some destiny to God Glorious, and kind to man?—If torn apart One must her empire lose, and one her all.’ Thus as we spake, the hall clock vast and old, A waif from Spain's Armada chimed eleven: And from the stables drew a long-hair'd boy Who led a horse as shaggy as a dog, A splenetic child of thistles and hill-blast, Rock-ribbed, and rich in craft of every race From weasel to the beast that feigns to die. Mounting—alas! that friends should ever part,— My guest bade thus adieu: ‘For good or ill Our lands are linked.’ And I rejoined, ‘For which? This shall you answer when, your pledge fulfilled, Before the swallow you return, and meet The unblown Spring in our barbaric vale.’ EARLY POEMS: MEDITATIVE OR DEVOTIONAL. Dedication. TO THE MEMORY OF SOUTHWELL AND CRASHAN. ODE TO JERUSALEM. I Jerusalem, Jerusalem! If any love thee not, on them May all thy judgments fall; For every hope that crowns our earth, All birth-gifts of her heavenly birth To thee she owes them all! II Deep was thy guilt, and deep thy woe; The brand of Cain upon thy brow Each shore has felt thy tread: No Altar now is thine; no Priest; Upon thy hearth no paschal feast: The paschal moon is dead. III When from their height the Nations fall The kind grave o'er them strews her pall; They die as mortals die: But He who looked thee in the face Stamped there that look no years erase His own on Calvary. IV Awe-struck on thee men gaze, and yet Confess thy greatness, own our debt And trembling still revere The Royal Family of Man Supporting thus its blight and ban With constancy austere. V Those Sciences by us so prized The sternness of thy strength despised, Devices light and vain Of men who lack the might to live In that repose contemplative Which Asian souls maintain. VI By thee the Book of Life was writ; And, wander where it may, with it Thy soul abroad is sent: Wherever towers a Christian Church Palace of Earth, Heaven's sacred Porch It is thy monument. VII Thy minstrel songs, like sounds wind-borne From harps on Babel boughs forlorn O'er every clime have swept; And Christian mothers yet grow pale With echoes faint of Rachel's wail; Our maids with Ruth have wept. VIII Thou bind'st the Present with the Past The prime of ages with the last; The golden chain art thou Whereon alone all fates are hung Of nations springing, or upsprung Earthward once more to bow. IX Across the World's tumultuous gate Thou flingest thy shadow's giant weight; The mightiest birth of Time For all her pangs she may not bear Until her feast she bids thee share And mount her throne sublime. X Far other gaze than that he pours On empires round thee sunk, and shores That once in victory shone, Far other gaze and paler frown The great Saturnian star bends down On cedared Lebanon. XI He knows that thou, obscured and dim Thus wrestling all night long with him Shall victor rise at last: Destined thy mystic towers to rear More high than his declining sphere When, downward on the blast XII God's mightiest Angel leaps and stands, A Shape o'er-shadowing seas and lands; And swears by Him who swore A faithful oath and kind to Man Ere worlds were shaped or years began, That ‘Time shall be no more.’ PERSECUTION. AN ODE. I There was silence in the heavens When the Son of Man was led From the Garden to the Judgment; Sudden silence, strange, and dread! All along the empyreal coasts On their knees the immortal hosts Watched with sad and wondering eyes That tremendous sacrifice. II There was silence in the heavens When the priest his garment tore; Silence when that Twain accursed Their false witness faintly bore. Silence—though a tremor crept O'er their ranks—the Angels kept While that Judge, dismayed though proud, Washed his hands before the crowd. III But when Christ His cross was bearing, Fainting oft, by slow degrees, Then went forth the angelic thunder Of legions rising from their knees. Each bright Spirit grasped a brand; And lightning flashed from band to band: An instant more had launched them forth Avenging terrors to the earth. IV Then from God there fell a glory Round and o'er that multitude; And by every fervent angel With hushing hand another stood: Another, never seen before, Stood one moment and no more! —Peace, brethren, peace! to us is given Suffering; vengeance is for Heaven. THE MARTYRDOM.ANGELS. Bearing lilies in our bosom Blessed Agnes, we have flown, Missioned from the Heaven of Heavens Unto thee and thee alone: We are coming, we are flying, To behold thy happy dying.AGNES. Bearing lilies far before you, Whose fresh odours backward blown Light those smiles upon your faces Mingling sweet breath with your own Ye are coming, smoothly, slowly, To the lowliest of the lowly.ANGELS. Unto us the boon was given— One glad message, holy maid, On the lips of two blest Spirits Like an incense-grain was laid; As it bears us on like lightning Cloudy skies are round us bright'ning.AGNES. I am here, a mortal maiden: If our Father aught hath said Let me hear His words and do them— Ought I not to feel afraid As ye come your shadows flinging O'er a breast to meet them springing? ANGELS. Agnes, there is joy in Heaven! Gladness like the day is flung O'er the spaces never measured; And from every angel's tongue Swell those songs of impulse vernal All whose echoes are eternal. Agnes, from the depth of Heaven Joy is rising like a spring Borne above its grassy margin Borne in many a crystal ring; Each o'er beds of wild flowers gliding, Over each low murmurs sliding. When a Christian lies expiring Angel choirs, with plumes outspread, Bend above his death-bed singing That when Death's mild sleep is fled There may be no harsh transition While he greets the heavenly vision. AGNES. Am I dreaming, blessed angels? Late ye floated two in one; Now a thousand radiant Spirits Round me weave a glistening zone, Lilies as they wind, extending, Roses with those lilies blending. See! the horizon's ring they circle! Now they gird the zenith blue; And now o'er every brake and billow Float like mist, and flash like dew. All the earth with life o'erflowing Into heavenly shapes is growing! They are rising: they are rising: As they rise the veil is riven! They are rising; I am rising: Rising with them into heaven; Rising with those shining legions Into Life's eternal regions. ODE. The marvels of the seas and earth Their works and ways, are little worth Compared with man their lord: He masters Nature through her laws And therefore not without a cause Is he by all adored. Lord of the mighty Eye and Ear, Each centring an immortal sphere Of empire and command: Lord of the heavenly Breast and Brow, That step which makes all creatures bow, And the earth-subduing hand. And yet, not loftier swells the state Of Man o'er shapes inanimate In majesty confest Than among men, that man by Faith Assured in life, confirmed in death Uptowers above the rest! For God is with him; and the end Of all things, downward as they tend Toward their term and close A sov'reign throne for him prepares; And makes of vanquished pains and cares A couch for his repose! While kingdoms lapse, and all things range He rules a world exempt from change; He sees as Spirits see: And garners ever more and more While years roll by, an ampler store Of glorious liberty; Yea, ten times glorious when at last The enfranchised Soul, her trials past, Stands up, prepared to die; And, fanning wide her swan-like plumes A glory flings across the glooms Through which her course must lie. VESPER HYMN. The lights o'er yonder snowy range Shine yet, intense yet tender; Or, slowly passing, only change From splendour on to splendour. Before the dying eyes of Day Immortal visions wander; Dreams prescient of a purer ray And morn spread still beyond her. Lo! heavenward now those gleams expire In heavenly melancholy; The barrier mountains, peak and spire, Relinquishing them slowly. Thus shine, O God! our mortal Powers, While grief and joy refine them; And when in death they fade be ours Thus gently to resign them! NOCTURN HYMN. Now God suspends its shadowy pall Above the world, yet still A steely lustre plays o'er all With evanescent thrill. Softly, with favouring footstep, press Among those yielding bowers; Over the cold dews colourless Damp leaves and folded flowers. Sleep, little birds in bush and brake! 'Tis surely ours to raise Our hymns ere humbler choirs awake Their anthem in God's praise. The impatient zeal of faithful love Hath forced us from our bed; But doubly blest repose will prove After our service said. How dim, how still this slumbering wood! And O how sweetly rise From clouded boughs and herbs bedewed Their odours to the skies! Sweet as that mood of mystery Where thoughts that hide their hues And shapes are only noticed by The fragrance they diffuse. But hark! o'er all the mountain verge The night-wind sweeps along; O haste, and tune its echoing surge To a prelusive song; A song of thanks and laud to Him Who makes our labour cease; Who feeds with love the midnight dim And hearts devout with peace. ADAM REFUSES THE GIFTS OF THE RACE OF CAIN. A FRAGMENT. I. Enthroned, and mantled in a snow-white robe Man's sire I saw, the Lord of all the globe; High-priest of all the Church, and Prophet sure Of Him whose promised kingdom shall endure Until the last of Adam's race is dead. Nor crown, nor mitre rested on his head; Yet kings with awe had viewed him! Deep and slow His speech; the words I knew not nor could know; But sighed to hear amid their golden sound A melancholy echo from the ground. Ages were flown since Adam's lifted hand Had plucked, insurgent 'gainst Divine command, That Fruit, a sacrament of death which gave Perpetual life a forfeit to the grave: Yet still those orbs their Maker once that saw Governed the nations of the world with awe. Mournful they looked, as though their sorrowing weight Reposed for aye on Eden's closing gate; Mournful, yet lustrous still those lordly eyes First mortal mirror of the earth and skies And still with piercing insight filled as when God's new-made creatures passed beneath their ken While he decreed, in his celestial speech, Prophetic names symbolical for each. All round, checkering the steep with giant shade His mild and venerable race were laid, For dance and song no wreaths as yet had won: Many their strong eyes bent upon the sun, Some on a sleeping infant's smiling face, Wherein both Love and Faith were strong to trace The destined Patriarch of a future race! II. Then through the silent circle, winged with joy, A radiant herald moved, a shepherd boy. Wondering he stepped; ere long, like one afraid A tribute at those feet monarchal laid, A Lyre, gem-dowered from many a vanished isle. Thereon the Father gazed without a smile: But some fair children with the bright toy played; While sound so rapturous thrilled the echoing glade That Seers, cave-hid, looked up with livelier cheer; And the first childless mother wiped away a tear! III. Later there came, as one who comes from far A branded warrior, gloomy from the war: Dark was his face, yet bright, and stern as though It bent o'er that of an expiring foe, Retorting still with sympathetic glare The imprecating anguish imaged there! A tribute too that warrior brought, a shield Graven with emblems of a death-strewn field And placed it at the Patriarch's feet, and spoke; ‘Certain Oppressors reared an impious yoke And passed beneath it brethren of their race; Therefore we rose and hewed them from their place.’ All pale the Patriarch sat—long time his eye Fixed on the deepening crimson of the sky Where sanguine clouds contended with the dun: Then turned, and whispered in the ear of one Who, on his death-bed, whispered to his son— That son beheld the Deluge! THE PLANETS; OR, OLD AND NEW. The Legend of the last of Grecian dreams— A wandering Bard's. As silver stream that bounds Singing, from rock to rock, when through dark pines The moonbeams break their javelins on its mail, Gloom-loving splendour fairer for that gloom, So bright so sweet his Pagan songs, poured forth Full oft at rural festival: but Grace Came to him, that he scorned his country's Gods And lived, though late, true bondsman of the Cross, Spurning those beauteous Fables fair but false, All that in youth the mythic Seers had taught him, For Beauty deathless, sacred and eterne. On Asian shores he strayed while Polycarp Ruled yet at Smyrna; from that Martyr old First heard of Christ. 'Twas there his lyre he brake: This was the last of all the songs he sang. Of Love, whose golden chain makes all things one; Of Zeal, that keeps earth pure; of Majesty, Which, like a crown, steadies the world's great head; Of Wisdom, which all these tempers and guides, Of Love, and Zeal, and Majesty, and Wisdom, Which light as stars our mortal night, and give Limits to Empire, and free space to Good, Had been my thoughts. Within a bark I lay And in a book was reading of the Gods. Reading, I marvelled how that record old Fabled of Truth: how Song, not yet corupt Like a great wave lifted the mind of man, And gave him ampler prospect. While I mused The setting sun flamed on the deep, the bells Pealed from a Church hardby and songs went forth: Then waned that radiance and the anthem died; My brow dropped on the volume; and I dreamed. Methought it was the vigil of the day Of Resurrection; when the kings alone Shall throng as nations. In a murmuring field Of harvests by autumnal suns embrowned, Declining softly to the Western sea I lay; then night fell, cloud-like, o'er the deep. An Angel caught me by the hands, and bore me Far up, and on. Ere long I stood alone Upon the point of a great promontory: A Cross was on the edge: from thence a bay Went back oblique into the heart of Heaven: Heaven's phantom mountains girt it marble-black, Though streaked with flying heralds of the dawn. I on that Cross had leaned methought an hour, When from the bosom of that darkness old A glorious semblance momently more large, Emerged with speed divine: beneath his feet, Which scarcely touched it, was a Planet bent; I marked it not at first, but deemed him flying, Such joy was from his lustrous forehead poured While his bright hair streamed back, both hands upheld As though expectant of some heavenly crown! Like homeward bark he wound into that bay. A milder Star came next; and he thereon Was like a youthful god: high as his lips He held a golden Shell; calm-faced as one Who late hath sung, and for the echo waits. Into that haven wound he. Next I saw A lovely Virgin standing in white robes That shone like silver on the Morning Star. She, with one hand into her bosom pressed A dove: the other more than lily white Was ever smoothing down its snowy wings, And yet on it she gazed not but on Heaven. I turned—in minstrel's garb beside me stood That Youth who last had vanished; ‘Well,’ he sang, ‘Doth Love, without the aid of eyes assure His heart; upon some other heart reposing With beatings undistinguished from his own.’ She too had passed, when loud I cried, ‘Declare The Vision!’ ‘She loved much,’ the youth replied, ‘Therefore to her the star of Love is given. But see’—and Mars towards us moved—the fourth! A shield was on his breast; and, raised to Heaven, Both hands held high a Sword of God that beamed From hilt to point with blood incarnadine, The Cross upon his heart. His helm thrown back The warrior's eyes were fixed on that Sword's point, Which from pure ether drew a stream of fire, And, blazing like an amethystine star Poured beatific splendour on his face. ‘No other Spirit with a deeper joy,’ Thus spake the Youth, ‘from out those crimson urns That stand beside the everlasting Altar Shall drink the sacramental wine of Life.’ Thus while he spake the Planet disappeared; And instant o'er his track great Jove advanced A kingly shape, and crowned with diamond: All round his loins a jewelled zone, inwrought With many symbols, like the zodiac clung; The brightest sphere of Heaven beneath his feet: And He was sceptred. ‘Lo! how soon,’ thus sang That joyous Youth, ‘doth Empire, crowned by Death, Tread in the bloody steps of Martyrdom! Go forth, great King!’ and Jupiter passed by. Then all was hushed: till slowly like a sound So faint we know not when began its tremor Forth from the darkness the Saturnian star Began to move. An old man knelt thereon With prophet robes and face depressed and pale In hue like that which vaporous Autumn breathes On the dim gold of her discoloured woods. He bent his plaited brow and tawny beard O'er a short bar clasped tight in both his hands— ‘Lo,’ cried that youth, ‘the hoary might of Time! The Linker of the End to the Beginning! Ever his iron sceptre thus he bends Into a cirque, type of Eternity, And crown for the most worthy: when 'tis wrought, Time's hard and iron sway is gone for ever, His boast to crown a mightier than himself.’ As Saturn passed, methought a smile there lay Hid in his sallow cheek. ‘Declare,’ I cried, ‘The mystery—what these are, and what art thou?’ ‘These are the Planets,’ spake the Youth, ‘and they Who ride them are the loftiest Soul of each, By Virtue raised to rule those glittering orbs. The first that passed was Earth, thine ancient home. The third was Venus, in the solar beam That bathes as water-lily in clear lake; Her children are a choir of loving Spirits Lying on violet banks by tuneful streams; There on the plume-like trees the wind blows gently For ever gently: not a mother there Would fear to rock her new-born infant's cot Upon the topmost bough. Of these but few Have sojourned on the earth and striven to lure By gentleness your race to gentleness; Oftenest not long their exile—by the sword Hewn down, or trampled under foot of men. The fourth was Mars: there dwell a hero race Warring on evil. Ofttimes to the earth Oppressed by tyrants, one of these was sent Breaker of chains. The Star of Jupiter Unto imperial Spirits doth belong: There, o'er its sea-like levels rise their thrones Like pyramids o'er Nilus kenned: on earth Men stare in wonder at their haughty feet, That tread your Planet like a thing foredoomed. In Saturn dwell the Prophets, far apart, 'Mid groves, and caves in sequence hollowed out Within the walls of the precipitous mountains. Before them, like a veil, from heights unknown The noiseless torrents stream scarce pierced by beams From seven broad moons: their wrinkled foreheads old They bend o'er emblemed scrolls and books of Fate. Of these but few have ever dwelt on earth. Mortal! in Heaven was concord thus with men! Love, Zeal heroic, Majesty, and Wisdom, There where ye guessed not lived and wrought and reigned: In seats by Pagan fancies long usurped They wound their choral dances thus round earth: Men their own greatness knew not, but exchanged For dust, celestial sympathy.’ He spake, And light flashed from him making all things plain! ‘Tell me thy name.’ ‘I am,’ the Youth replied ‘The Shaping Instinct of the universe By bards of old named Hermes. I bestow Voice on all being; I of every Art Am father; earlier, in lone wastes I cry Scaring those demons which in dance obscene Trample to mire of clay the heart of man Which should be singing ever, like this Shell Whose warbling but the echo is of strains Yon vanished Planets ever sang. Henceforth They rest:—but hark their sabbath song!’ He raised That Shell, and straight a harmony so rich It seemed the blending of all lovely voices, Moved o'er us like one wave that fills a bay: And 'mid that Pæan murmuring I could hear A low deep music tremulent though sweet With that Eolian anthem sink and rise. ‘My task is done,’ it said; ‘My wrinkled hands have rest; the Crown is made: But who of earth can wear it? Whose brows are strong and broad enough to bear it? Let him speak, let him speak, For my veins are waxing weak; These eyes no longer can their vigil keep, My lids are growing heavy—I must sleep.’ A sound that quelled all other sounds, as stars At sunrise, shook my heart; and I beheld Upon another and a larger sphere Than all which yet had passed—a sphere unguessed By them of Pagan times—an Old Man standing: Older than all the Prophets seemed that Man, Older, methought than Time himself; sea-sands Had numbered not his childhood's years. His hair And beard rolled down athwart his breast, more white Than snows when Boreal lights from polar skies Shine keen on icy streams, or lies the Moon Dead on the glacier's lap— O'er his calm face bright thoughts went sweeping ever Like gleams from rippling waters heaved o'er rocks: His eyes seemed yet to hold those vanished stars. I closed my own; and when I dared to look He had not wound into that bay but passed Far to the North. That Youth beside me still Fixed on him eyes with awe distent, as though In garden-haunt long-loved a man at ease Up glancing o'er the lily and the rose, Confronted stood by some white mountain range Marvel till then unkenned, though ever there, Dwarfing a subject world. At last he spake; ‘Him knew I not of old: Him, knowing now, I fear to name: Old Bard of Grecian Race The time of Finite Beauty is gone by: The time of all the Infinitudes is come And Beauty throned mid all. Lay down thine ear Down to this Shell, and hear Him what He speaks With that crystalline bass which like a sea Ingulfs all other sounds or lets them float As bubbles on the surface.’ I replied, ‘Not so! I will not hear Him lest I die;’ And in that terror woke. A TALE OF THE MODERN TIME. June 1840. PART I. I An old man once I knew whose aged hair A summer brilliance evermore retained: Youthful his voice and full not flawed nor spare; His cheek all smooth and like a child's engrained, Or marble altar innocently stained With roses mirrored in its tablet white— Like May his eye; his foot-fall slow but light. II Yet no one marvelled at him: of his ways Rarely men spake as of the buried dead; And dropped him from their lips with trivial phrase: ‘Gentle he was, and kind,’ the neighbours said, ‘Albeit an idle life and vain he led.’ Odours he loved from flowers at twilight dim; And breath and song of morn: children loved him. III I have beheld him on a wintry plant An eye delighted bending full an hour! As though the Spring o'er every tendril scant Crept 'neath his ken. Methought he had the power To see the growing root plain as the flower. O'er a leaf's margin he would pore and gaze As o'er some problem of the starry maze! IV Over a rose his palm he loved to curve As though it brought him warmth from out the ground. Instinctively his step would often swerve Following slow streams that down in darkness wound: His body there he bent above the sound Heard but by him. A virgin world he trod As though it were the precinct of some god. V I wondered at him long: but youth and awe Restrained me from demanding of his story. At last, it chanced one day this man I saw Reclining 'neath an oak rifted and hoary Last tree of a wild, woodland promontory. Far round, below, the forest deep and warm Lay waving in the light of an illumined storm. VI I placed me at his feet: his eyes were closed; Celestial brightness hung upon his mien, And all his features, tranquilly composed: I gazed on him, and cried, ‘Where hast thou been In youth? What done, what read, what heard, what seen?’ Irreverent was the inquest: yet the man Looked on me with a smile, and thus began. VII The Tale, true told, of every Human Being Were awful; yet upon each new-born child, As though none else there lived, the Eye All-seeing Rested in glory! Heaven looked down and smiled: And choirs of joyful Angels undefiled Around the cradle sang and evermore In youth walked near him, after, and before. VIII Stranger! the veil of Sense in mercy hides The perils round us, as the mercies! Say, Amid the forest on the mountain sides What miles of mazes hast thou tracked to-day? Had some black chasm girt visibly thy way Couldst thou secure have wandered thus? Not so— The danger is not ours while danger none we know. IX My life hath been a marvel. Thine no less. If thou that marvel hast not yet discerned Lament not therefore. Unto wretchedness That knowledge grew for which our parents yearned. The best and happiest ofttime least have learned Of Man's dread elements—what dust—what spirit— That which we are, what have, what make, and what inherit. X Action in trance, in panic Thought were lost, If all we are we knew ourselves to be. O'er a great deep, now calm, now tempest-tossed Rises one rock; but, hid below the sea That rock slants down—a mountain! Such are we— Our being's summit only o'er the deeps Ascends: the rest is blind, and in the abysses sleeps. XI In Man the Finite from the Depth ascends: Centre is Man of all men hear or see; Chapel where Time with Incorruption blends Where Dust is wedded to Divinity. All but omnipotent in Will is he. Freedom his awful privilege! Like a God He walks at noon; at night lies cold beneath the sod. XII Thou seekest Knowledge: every lore we prize But as a lamp thereby ourself to know. Stranger! 'tis well within to turn our eyes If we look heavenward having turned them so. Horror unnamed and phantom forms of woe Rebuke the haughtier quest. With single aim If thou my tale require receive in joy the same. PART II. I Happy my childhood was; devout and glad: My youth was full of glory, joy, and might, Like some volcanic morn, and tempest-clad, In tropic regions, when from gulfs of night Day leaps at once to the empyreal height. Strength without bound in spirit, body, and soul, I felt: and in my rapture mocked control. II In the madness of that strength I went abroad Where'er Ambition called, or Passion led: Full many a deep my ploughing bark hath scored: Full many a plain hath echoed to my tread: All enterprise I sought: all books I read: All thoughts I pondered murmuring in my mirth That text, ‘Be thou, O Man, the Lord of Earth.’ III Deeply I studied in all tomes and tongues The Historic legend, Philosophic page: More deeply yet those earlier mythic songs Built up by Bard for legislative Sage Himself a builder up, from age to age, Of States—true poems—Policies sublime, Wherein well-balanced Functions metre make, and rhyme. IV All Art and Science at the Gentile feast Of Western pride advanced, I knew right well: And laughed to mark the great Book of the East Push on through all as through a garden dell Bright with frail flowers and paved with glittering shell Some Asian Elephant. I sought within For God, and there alone; and recked not of my sin. V Corporeal instincts only I denied: My larger concupiscence temperance feigned. Humble oft seemed I through the excess of pride And calm of conscious strength. No muscle strained; That which the eye desired, the hand attained: Too proud for Pride's less triumphs I had sworn To shun them; or, first won, to fling them back in scorn. VI Was I then wicked? Child! applauding nations Such question asked, had called me great and good. I loved my kind—but more their acclamations: My thoughts were birds of prey and snatched that food From weak and strong to gorge their infant brood:— Much knowing, this I knew not. But the hour Was come that proved at last my fancied power. VII One day a mountain's summit I was pacing: Through cloudy chasms the sunbursts fell thereon; Over its plain the mighty winds were racing Quiring Eolian anthems in loud tone. Long time I walked in pride and walked alone: And what I was revolved—and turned again, To mark the far off towns and visible main. VIII Man I considered then: and I looked forth Upon the works and wonders of his hand: The deep his beaten road, his palace earth; Commanding all things; yet beneath command Of Mind—whereof I grasped the magic wand. —Fronting the sun, that set in blood, I saw Man's shape against its disk; and yet I felt not awe. IX All treasures of my Thought again I spread Unrolled as in a map before my eyes; And walked among them with a conqueror's tread That moves o'er fields of hard-won victories, Dreaming of mightier yet. A long disguise Fell from me in that rapture; and I trod A worshipper no longer but a God! X Towards me a throne descended through the air— Then lo! the crown of my demoniac Pride Updrawn, raised up my horror-stricken hair! For, wheresoe'er I wandered, by my side Another step appeared to tread and glide: No mortal form was near: and in the abyss Of heaven, the mountain floors are echoless. XI I stopped; it stopped: I walked; it walked: I turned: My fears I mocked, unworthy of a man. Then a cold poison from that heart self-spurned Welled forth: and I, with eyes unfilmed, began Once more my life and inmost heart to scan: Till suddenly what shape in soul I was Before me I beheld plainly as in a glass. XII Then my disease I knew; but not the cure. Lightning, sent flaming from the breast of heaven, Revealed my sins long-hid from lure to lure: Beams from the eyes of God, like shafts were driven Against me: to her depth my soul was riven Whereof each portion, conscious and amazed, In stupor of despair upon the other gazed. XIII Thus on my throne, that marble mountain height, My Soul I saw! I went I know not whither. Down like a tempest fell from heaven the night: I heard the sea and rushed in panic thither; By ghost-like clouds, and woods my step made wither, And rock, and chasm that seemed to gape and sever, I rushed—and rushed, methought, for ever and for ever. PART III. I I woke in a great cavern of the main. The wave rolled in upon its strong breast bearing A storm of icy wind and cloudy rain With sound as if of souls that died despairing: The billows, that rough beach harrowing and tearing, Thundered far off: while morning, just begun, Peered dimly through the spray, and through the shadows dun. II That shore was piled with death, like Nature's bier. There, whitening spread a sea-beast's mouldering bones: The rifted wings of some dead eagle here. Over the wet cliff went funereal moans. Yet calm at first I paced those wave-washed stones, Whose crash the deadlier sound awhile could quell Of that low step close by, my spirit's knell. III Still, still, where'er I turned that step would follow. My fate above me hung as by a thread: Beneath me yawned the earth, a vast veiled hollow! To battle-fields athirst for death I fled. Yet there, while headlong hosts beside me sped, That footstep still I heard and knew from all; Now harsh, now dull as moth fretting a coffin's pall. IV Thick, thick like leaves from autumn's skeleton woods The shafts went by me, and as idly went. Then back I turned into my solitudes As slow, in sullen cloud of rage o'er-spent, As mountain beast into dim forest tent, With hunger unabated, when the night Melts; and the eastern wolds spread wide in hated light. V Stranger! I tell you part: I speak not all. Thenceforth I walked alone; and joined my kind Only when lured by some black funeral: On capital cities oft, with watchings blind, I gazed, what time rushed forth the freezing wind Between their turrets and the wintry stars; All day I lay in tombs, or caves dim-lit with spars. VI On peaks eclipsing to its rim the ocean Hath been my dwelling: rivers I have seen Whose sound alone dispersed a gradual motion O'er cloud-like woods, their deep primeval screen. Sand-worlds my feet have trod beneath the sheen Of spheres unnamed. From zone to zone I fled As though each land in turn grew fire below my tread. VII But Heaven had ended now my time of sorrow When most I seemed in penal horror bound: Dreamless one night I slept, and on the morrow Strange tears now first amid the dew I found Wherewith my heavy hair and cheeks were drowned; And in my heart, fanned by that morning air, There lay, as I walked on, my childhood's long-lost prayer. VIII Wearied, I sat upon a sunny bank, Ridged o'er a plain yet white with virgin snows Though now each balmy noon and midnight dank Lightened the burden of the vernal rose; My eyes, their wont it was till daylight's close, Fixed on my own still shadow, in that light Intense keenly defined, and dark as night. IX I hung above it: sudden, by that shade Another shadow rested; faint and dim: At first I thought my tears the phantom made; Then cried ‘I do but dream it, form and limb.’ In horror then abroad I seemed to swim: Then my great agony grew calm and dumb; For now I knew indeed my destined hour was come. X My spirit's foe was now the spoil to claim: My heart's chill seemed his hand upon my heart— O marvel! clearer while that shade became No mocking fiend, I saw, no lifted dart; But a dejected Mourner! down, apart, His head declined: one hand in grief he pressed Upon the heaving shadow of a sorrowing breast. XI The other round my neck was thrown, so fair, So kind, so gentle, none thereon might gaze Nor feel that Love alone had placed it there! There dropped the cloud of my Self-haunted days. He who for years had tracked my wandering ways Had followed me in love! O Virgin-born, Thy shadow was the light of my eternal morn! XII Stranger! there came a joy to me that hour; Such joy that never can it leave my soul: All Heaven, condensed to one ambrosial flower, Fell on my bosom—Truth's inviolate whole! Obedience was the way; Love was the goal: God, the true Universe, around me lay: Systems and suns thenceforth were motes in that clear ray! XIII From that time saw I what 'tis Heaven to see, That God is God indeed, and good to Man. Theist then first. Who Love's Reality Hath proved, forgets himself to probe and scan. Knowledge for him remits her ancient ban: Back fly those demons outwardly to sin That lure the soul or turn our inquest sad within. XIV Then looked I up; and drank from Heaven that light Which makes the world within and world around Alone intelligible, pure, and bright: My forehead then, but not by me, was crowned: Then my lost youth, no longer sought, was found: My penance then complete; or turned to pain So sweet, the enamoured heart embraced it like a gain. XV My kind, new-vested in the eternal glory Of God made Man, glorious to me became. Thenceforth those crowns that shine in mortal story I deemed it grief to bear, madness to claim. To be a man seemed now man's loftiest aim. True Rule seemed this—to wait on one the least Of those who fight God's fight, or join His kingly feast. XVI Then the Three Virtues bade me kneel and drink: Then the Twelve Gifts fell from the heavenly tree: Then from the Portals Seven, and crystal brink, Dread Sacraments and sweet came down to me. Then saw I plain that Saintly Company Through whom, as Living Laws, that world which Sense Conceals, is ruled of God, by Prayer's Omnipotence. XVII Thus in high trance, and the way unitive, I watched one year: which sabbath ended, God Stirred up once more my nest, and bade me live, Active and suffering. So again I trod The temporal storm and wrestled with the flood; And laboured long; and, by His grace, behold, Two grains I brought, or three, to swell the hills of gold. XVIII Lastly, my faculties of body and mind Decayed, through God's high will and boundless love, And from the trunk whereon they grew declined, As leaves from trees or plumes from moulting dove. Thenceforth, more blest, I soared no more, nor strove; But sat me down, and wait the end, as waits, Sun-warmed, a beggar by great palace gates. XIX Stranger! this tale of one man's life is over. No knowledge mine in youth have I unlearned: But I the sense was gifted to discover Of lore possessed long since, yet undiscerned: Truths which, as abstract or remote, I spurned In youth, as real most my heart now prizes; And, what of old looked real, now as dream despises; XX Or but like dreams reveres. Hollow and vain To me the pageants of this world appear; Or truth but symbolled to the truthful brain. The future world I find already here; The unbeholden palpable and dear: Firm as a staff to lean on; or a rod Of power miraculous, and sent by God. XXI Stranger, farewell! Far off a bell is tolling: A bridal or a funeral bell—whate'er It chaunts, in harmony the tones are rolling. All bells alike summon mankind to prayer! Yea, and for me those twain one day shall pair Their blended chimes to one. When I am dead Stain not with tears my grave: it is a bridal bed. XXII He ceased. The inmost sense of that I heard I know not: yet, because the man was wise, His legend I have written word for word. All things hold meaning: to unclouded eyes Where eagle never soared are auguries. It may be then this weed some balm doth bear; Some cure for sight long dim; some charm against despair. MAGDALENE IN THE DESERT. I Say, who that woman kneeling sole Amid yon desert bare? The cold rain beats her bosom, The night-wind lifts her hair— It is the holy Magdalene, O listen to her prayer. ‘Lord, I have prayed since eventide: And midnight now hath spread Her dusky pall abroad o'er all The living and the dead. The stars each moment shine more large, Down-gazing from the skies: O Father of the sorrowful Turn thus on me Thine eyes!’ II Hark, thunder shakes the cliff far off! The woods in lightning glare; The eagle shivers in her nest The lion in his lair: And yet, now trembling and now still, She makes the same sad prayer. ‘Lord of the sunshine and the storm! The darkness and the day! Why should I fear if Thou art near? And Thou art near alway! Thus in the wilderness, Thy Son Was tempted, Lord, by Thee: He triumphed in that awful strife: O let Him plead for me.’ III How often must that woman pray? How long kneel sighing there? O joy to see the Holy Cross Clasped to a breast so fair!— Speak louder, blessed Magdalene, And let me join thy prayer. ‘Lord! Thou hast heard my plaint all night; And now the airs of morn My forehead fan, my temples wan, My face, and bosom worn! O! o'er my weak and wildered soul, Make thus Thy Spirit move; That I may feel the light once more And answer love with love!’ ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. I ‘Those destined Thoughts that haunt my breast, And throb, and heave, and swell, Impatient of their painful rest And state invisible, Those Thoughts at last must meet the day, And with me dwell, or on me prey: On me, on me those Thoughts must call And act, and live, and move abroad: I am the mother of them all: Be Thou their Father, God!’ II Thus prayed I; musing on that law By which the children of the brain Their linked generations draw, A melancholy train From moods long past which feigned to die But in whose quickening ashes lie Immortal seeds of pain or pleasure No foot can crush, no will control, No craft transmute, no prescience measure, Dread harvests of the ripening soul! REALITY. Love thy God, and love Him only: And thy breast will ne'er be lonely. In that one great Spirit meet All things mighty, grave, and sweet. Vainly strives the soul to mingle With a creature of our kind: Vainly hearts with hearts are twined; For the deepest still is single. An impalpable resistance Holds like natures still at distance. Mortal! love that Holy One! Or dwell for aye alone. HUMANITY. I Earth's green expanse: her dawns one wave of light: Her soft winds creeping o'er the forest tall: Her silence; and the comfort of her night; Are these then all? All thou canst give to me, Humanity? II Tears running down the track of buried smiles: Time's shades condensed into the sable pall: Hope that deserts; and Gladness that beguiles; Are these then all? All thou canst give to me, Humanity? III I saw a Spirit dark 'twixt Earth and Heaven, Holding a cup in both hands lest it fall— O friends! a mournful life to us were given, If Earth were all! But He who lives for aye hath looked on thee, Humanity. VIA INTELLIGENTIÆ. O wash thine eyes with many a bitter tear; And all things shall grow clear. Bend that proud forehead nearer to the ground; And catch a far foot's sound. Say! wouldst thou know what faithful suppliants feel? Thou, too, even thou, must kneel. Do but thy part; and ask not why or how: Religion is a Vow. They sang not idle songs; pledges they made For thee, an infant, laid In the Church's lucid bosom. These must thou Fulfil, or else renounce! Fulfil them now. A Cross, and not a wreath was planted on thy brow. [Forward, a step or two, where'er we go] Forward, a step or two, where'er we go We gaze; not on the spot our feet are treading: Reading, we look along, or glance below, Unconscious of the letters we are reading. The Future moulds the Present. Do not halt To probe, or mourn, each felt, or fancied fault; ‘Steadfast by Faith,’ who treads where Hope hath trod, Following her wingèd Sister to the throne of God! ST. DYMPHNA. Within the crowded fane she knelt, As if before God's throne: Nought heard, saw nought; alone she felt: Alone with Christ alone. Amid the desert knelt the maid; Alone, yet not alone; Praying with all that ever prayed Before the eternal Throne. No wealth was hers in fields or flocks: The poor had all her gold: But honey gushed from the sunny rocks, And in milk the streamlet rolled. O blissful maid, through light and shade So bright a path was thine; Round hill and glade thy lustre played, And still o'er earth doth shine! MARTHA AND MARY. I ‘O Sister! leave you thus undone The bidding of the Lord? Or call you this a welcome? Run, And deck with me the board.’ Thus Martha spake; but spake to one Who answered not a word: For she kept ever singing, ‘There is no joy so sweet As musing upon one we love; And sitting at his feet!’ II ‘O Sister! must my hands alone His board and bath prepare? His eyes are on you! raise your own: He'll find a welcome there!’ Thus spake again in loftier tone That Hebrew woman fair. But Mary still kept singing, ‘There is no joy so sweet As musing upon him we love; And resting at his feet!’ HYMNS. I. ‘The Earth is the Lord's.’ I Lord of the Lords of all the earth! Lord of the souls of men! From Thee all heavenly gifts have birth; To Thee return again! II The lightnings flashed from off Thy throne Fill Heaven and Earth with light; And by that living flame alone Men read the world aright. III On every crown and sceptre shed Thy beams of glory shine; And burn round every Father's head, That rules by right Divine. IV The Priests by thee anointed, stand Beside his altar, each; And all the Wise, a Prophet-band, What Thou hast taught them teach. V Thy voice, O Father, rolls around The world for evermore; The speech we know not but the sound In silence we adore. VI The Heavens themselves repose thereon: Thereon the Earth is stayed: And seasons change, and rivers run By Thee ordained and swayed. II. PEACE. I We lead a gentle life below: Our days, that seem to pass, Glide on and blend—before Thy throne Thus spreads the sea of glass. II One image fills that crystal sea; One light o'er all doth shine: Yet every separate drop hath power That radiance to enshrine. III Nor less in unity and light True brethren, we abide; ‘Like drops of Hermon's dew’ that still Into each other slide. IV Eternal glory, thanks and praise To Thee, O God, to Thee, Who buildest all the peace of men Upon that prime decree: V That he who loves the Lord his God Should hold all creatures dear; And whoso fears his God, henceforth Should feel no baser fear. III. I ‘He giveth His beloved sleep.’ The haughty sow the wind: The storm they sow; the tempest reap; But rest they cannot find. II In sleep itself their furrowed brows, That care-worn mark retain; Avenger of the guilt it shows, The curse and brand of Cain! III Rest is of God. He doth not sleep; But while His children rest His hand outstretched and still doth keep O'er earth, their shadowed nest. IV His holy Angels chaunt around, To chase dark dreams away, That slumbers innocent and sound May leave serene the day. IV. I In that cold cave with spices sweet When Christ, our Lord, lay dead, An Angel sat beside His feet, An Angel by His head. II All night their eyes to Heaven they raised Their wings around Him spread All day on those dark eyelids gazed But not a word they said. III And when the morn sabbatical Its Paschal light had spread, A chrysome robe o'er Earth's dark ball To Heaven those Angels sped. IV Keep, holy Angels, keep, O keep Such vigil by our bed: Calm visions from the urns of sleep, O'er us calm visions shed! V But when we wake to morning life And night's pure calm is fled Stay near us in our daily strife, Or we are worse than dead! V. I The stars shine bright while earth is dark While all the woods are dumb How clear those far off silver chimes From tower and turret come! II Chilly but sweet the midnight air: And lo! with every sound Down from the ivy-leaf a drop Falls glittering to the ground. III 'Twas night when Christ was born on earth; Night heard His faint, first cry; While Angels carolled round the star Of the Epiphany. IV Alas! and is our love too weak To meet Him on His way? To pray for nations in their sleep? For Love then let us pray! V Pray for the millions slumbering now: The sick, who cannot sleep: O may those sweet sounds waft them thoughts As peaceful, and as deep. VI Pray for the unholy and the vain: O may that pure-toned bell Disperse the Demon Powers of Air, And evil Dreams dispel! VII Pray for the aged, and the poor; The crown-encompassed head; The friends of youth, now far away; The dying; and the dead. VIII And ever let us wing our prayer With praise; and ever say Glory to God Who makes the night Benignant as the day! VI. I A low sweet voice from out the brake Provoked a loud reply: Now half the birds are half awake; They feel the morning nigh. II Fainting beneath her load of dreams The Moon inclines her brows, Expectant, towards those mightier beams That grant her toils repose. III Long streaks, the prophets of the Sun, Illume the dusk, grey hill: But still the heart of Heaven is dun; The day is virgin still! IV O Christ! ere yet beheld on earth How oft, incarnate Word, Thy Prophets heralded Thy birth! Alas, how seldom heard! V Rise, holy Brethren, rise, and sing A prayer: and while we pray The morn shall fan with heavenly wing Our lethargy away. VI Burst Thou, O God, these chains of flesh! These languid eyes inspire: Our spirits make as morning fresh, And pure as solar fire: VII And grant us, fronting thus the East, When all the heavenly Powers Come forth to deck the bridal feast, A place among Thy bowers! VIII Come, Lord and Master! come and take At last Thy ransomed home: Bid all Thy faithful dead awake; And may Thy Kingdom come! VII. CHRIST OUR EXAMPLE. I With virgin heart, undazzled eye, The Virgin-born went on Each snare surmounted or passed by, Until His task was done. II With bleeding feet but lifted head The waste of life He trod: Tinging, each step, with holy red The consecrated sod. III Those steps our earth doth yet retain: And when dark vapours hide That Sun which lights our pilgrim-train She too can be our guide. IV Father of Him and us! Thy grace On us and all bestow Who seek the goal He sought, to trace His footmarks in the snow! V O joy to follow Him in hope For days, for months, for years: Our steps in turn o'er His to drop And o'er His blood our tears! VIII. TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. I The wind rang out from depths of woods And pealed through valleys bent Among the echoing hills like tubes Of some vast instrument. Its sound we heard; but know not whence It came, nor whither went. II The wind upon our forehead blows: In gleams of lambent flame The sunbeams flash from wave and leaf: The hour is now the same As when to Christ's anointed Twelve That promised Spirit came. III The sound as of a rushing wind Before His wings He flung: And leaped on those uplifted brows In many a flaming tongue!— O breathe on us Thy seven-fold powers: O dwell our hearts among! IV Live Thou in Christ's mysterious Vine Until her branches spread Among the stars—to them as flowers 'Mid locks of one new-wed: And clasp in their descending arch The Earth's wide bridal-bed! HYMN. FOR THE FEAST OF THE HOLY INNOCENTS. I Let the Proto-martyr rest Earliest honoured of the dead; John! upon thy Saviour's breast Drop once more that saintly head! All the Church is met to-day Unto God to sing and pray; Remembering those, the Babes, to whom was given First for their Lord to die and meet Him first in Heaven! II Yield the children readiest place! Tender parents, near them stand! From each mother's tearful face All that little awe-struck band Well may learn and aptly teach That God's electing love can reach, Winding untracked its own mysterious way Souls which have only learned to suffer and obey. III As from some Hesperian Isle Ravished rose-leaves loosely strewn Through a dark lake's dim defile When the morning breeze hath blown— Such were ye: so smooth the breath That snatched you, blushing, on to death. Mourn, Rachel, mourn no longer! lest your sighs O'ertake those vernal souls soft journeying to the skies! IV Blessed infants timely caught From a mortal mother's breast, That wondering Angels might be taught What of earth is best! They with food of heavenly grain Meet your lips your strength sustain, And teach you words of heavenly lore, and keep A low and dulcet chaunt around you while you sleep. V Hark, I hear them as they bend O'er your cots, and gently sway them; Angels' songs with ours they blend: Night or morn they never stay them. ‘Glory be to God,’ they cry, ‘To, and from Eternity: To God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, All glory be from men, and from the Angel host.’ HYMN. THE MEEK. ‘Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.’ I Meek souls! whose humble faith can prize Those heavenliest gifts of man, Obedience, and Self-sacrifice, Life's first, last, only plan By which we mount ‘from grace to grace’ Toward our celestial resting-place! II All hail! the haughty from their towers Look down on you with scorn On you, scarce seen like meadow flowers Grass-hid, that perfume morn! Unmarked the while for them ye pray: Earth's salt that keeps her from decay. III Taught by the Church and by the Spirit Ye know that all things good Are yours, unsought; that ye inherit By virtue of your blood Old Adam's blood in Christ made pure Whate'er is worthy to endure. IV Therefore while haughtier hands up-pile Their towers of sun-burned clay On yielding sand, volcanic isle, A brief and perilous stay; Ye dwell in tents, removed at will: They fall; yet safe their inmates still! V ‘What man shall reign’ No matter who! Alas! we rave, and fret, We press, we struggle, we pursue; For what? for Power! And yet On us submissive Angels wait, Pleased with their mild Diaconate. VI O place us on the lowliest ground That we, thus low, may see, Upreared above us, and around, Rank, Order, and Degree: Terrace o'er terrace ranged on high To lure and rest the heavenward eye! VII All Earth is yours; her mild increase; Her lore through types laid bare; Her generous toils; her grateful ease; Her duties; and whate'er To nature, with a ‘natural art’ Freedom and heavenly peace impart. VIII Nature to docile hearts, and minds That sympathise with her In sunniest calms or dreariest winds Alike doth minister: Dark days her fasts the Fancy calls And bright her moving festivals. IX The soul uncumbered with a load Of self-dependent care Moves forth on equal plumes abroad, A Spirit of the air: Its own identity forsakes; Its own all shapes of beauty makes. X How much that Genius boasts as hers And fancies hers alone, On you, meek Spirits, Faith confers! The proud have further gone Perhaps, through life's deep maze; but you Alone possess the labyrinth's clue. XI To you the costliest spoils of Thought Wisdom, unclaimed, yields up; To you her far-sought pearl is brought And melted in your cup. To you her nard and myrrh she brings Like orient gifts to infant kings. XII The ‘single eye’ alone can see All Truths around us thrown In their eternal unity: The humble ear alone Has power to grasp, and time to prize, The sweetness of life's harmonies. XIII Notions, to Thought made visible Are but the smallest part Of those immortal Truths, which dwell Self-radiant in man's heart. With outward beams are others bright; But God has made you ‘full of light.’ XIV One science well ye know; the Will Of God, to man laid bare: One art have mastered; to fulfil The part assigned you there: If other, meaner lore ye sought, This first ye learned—to need it not! XV Empiric Laws, that hide the grace Of human life, as hard As iron mask upon a face From answering eyes debarred, Form but a lucid veil to you With all the Godhead shining through. XVI Yes, Angels prompt us, Spirits fence! But ye, a Father's hand Who trace through all His Providence, Discern that Angel-band; 'Tis yours alone their choirs to mark Descending to our precincts dark. XVII One half of all our cares and woes Exist but in our thought; And lightly fall the rest on those With them who wrestle not. The feather scarcely feels that gale Which bursts the seaman's strongest sail. XVIII Yourselves not loving, room have ye For love of all your kind: And ye revere the mystery Of Love Divine enshrined In human ties that, day by day Some portion lose of mortal clay. XIX And dearer far become the names Of Father, Child, and Wife To those who feel their heavenly claims: And holier earthly Life To those who in that myriad mirror See thus their Lord undimmed by error. XX In Kings you see Him on His throne: In Priests before the shrine: In suffering men you hear Him groan: Thus life becomes divine; Each shower with Fontal grace imbued, And Eucharistic all your food! XXI Your virtues shall not die with you Or those you leave behind, Destined each year to bloom anew, And ampler space to find For boughs o'er earth that spread and wave Though centered in your silent grave. XXII That Race ordained so long to be Sole witness here of God Formed but a single Family, Yea, scattered now abroad, Are still his seed whose marvelling eyes First saw them star-like in the skies! XXIII What, though the long-lived Patriarchs saw Their offspring as the sands! To those who see them not that Law Unchanged and changeless stands, That Law which honours in the dust The Souls that placed with God their trust. XXIV Even now in each fair infant's face The eye of Faith can see A mild and patriarchal grace A Regal dignity: He sits by future throngs half hid; His throne that living pyramid! XXV Hail, noble Spirits, hail, O hail! While bleats the lamb or cooes the dove, Your gentle kind shall never fail, Nor earth wax faint in love. Hail, kings of peace: to you are given Flower-crowns on earth, star-crowns in Heaven! HYMN. FOR THE BUILDING OF A COTTAGE. I. Lay foundations deep and strong On the rock, and not the sand— Morn her sacred beam has flung O'er our ancient land. And the children through the heather Beaming joy from frank bright eyes Dance along, and sing together Their loud ecstasies. Children, hallowed song to-day! Sing aloud; but singing pray. Orphic measures proudly swelling Lifted cities in old time: Build we now a humbler dwelling With a humbler rhyme! Unless God the work sustain Our toils are vain and worse than vain. Better to roam for aye than rest Under the impious shadow of a roof unblest! II. Mix the mortar o'er and o'er Holy music singing: Holy water o'er it pour Flowers and tresses flinging! Bless we now the earthen floor: May good Angels love it! Bless we now the new-raised door And that cell above it! Holy cell, and holy shrine For the Maid and Child divine! Remember thou that see'st her bending O'er that babe upon her knee All Heaven is ever thus extending Its arms of love round thee! Such thought thy step make light and gay As yon elastic linden spray On the smooth air nimbly dancing, Thy spirits like the dew glittering thereon and glancing! III. Castles stern in pride o'er-gazing Subject leagues of wolds and woods; Palace fronts their fretwork raising 'Mid luxurious solitudes! These, through clouds their heads uplifting, The lightning wrath of heaven invoke: His balance power is ever shifting; The reed outlasts the oak. Live, thou cottage! live and flourish Like a bank which mild dews nourish Bright with field flowers self-renewing, Annual violets, dateless clover; Eyes of flesh thy beauty viewing With a glance may pass it over; But to eyes that wiser are Thou glitterest like the morning star! O'er every heart thy beauty breathes Such sweets as morn shall waft from those new planted wreaths! IV. Our toils—not toils—are all but ended; The day has wandered by: Her silver gleams the moon hath blended With the azure of the sky: Yet still the sunset lights are ranging On from mossy stem to stem; Low winds their odours vague exchanging Chaunt day's requiem. Upon the diamonded panes The crimson falls with fainter stains: More high in heavenward aspiration The gables shoot their mystic lines: While now, supreme in grace as station The tower-like chimney shines. Beneath that tower an altar lies. Bring wood: light up the sacrifice! Now westward point the arched porch— Crown with a Cross the whole: our cot becomes a Church! V. Strike once more a livelier measure Circling those fair walls again: Songs of triumph, songs of pleasure Well become you, gladsome train! Mark that shadowy roof! each angle Angel heads and wings support: Those the woodbine soon must tangle These the rose shall court, And mingling closer hour by hour Enclose ere long a sabbath bower. There shall the Father oft at even Entone some ancient hymn or story Till earth once more grows bright as heaven With days of long past glory, When Truth and Honour ranged abroad To cleanse the world from Force and Fraud; When Zeal was humble; Hope was strong: And Virtue moved alone the angelic scourge of Wrong! VI. O happy days! exhaustless dower Of spotless joys and hours well spent Renewed while moons their radiance shower Upon the Acacia's silver tent, Or airs of balmiest mornings thrill And swell with renovated play The breasts of children, childlike still And innocent alway. O'er them light flit our woes and jars As shades o'er lilies, clouds o'er stars: Even now my fancy hears the cooing Of doves from well-known perch or croft; The bees even now the flowers are wooing With sleepy murmur soft. Glad home, from menial service pure! Thee shall no foreign wants obscure: Here all the ties are sacred ties: And Love shines clear through all, and Truth asks no disguise. VII. Kings of the earth! too frail, too small This humble tenement for you? Then lo! from Heaven my song shall call A statelier retinue! They come, the twilight ether cheering Not vain the suppliant song, not vain, Our earth on golden platform nearing, On us their crowns they rain! Like Gods they stand, the portal Lighting with looks immortal! Faith, on her chalice gazing deep: And Justice with uplifted scale: Meek Reverence; pure, undreaming Sleep: Valour in diamond mail: There Hope with vernal wreath: hardby Indulgent Love; keen Purity; And Truth with radiant forehead bare: And Mirth, whose ringing laughter triumphs o'er Despair. VIII. Breathe low! stand mute in reverent trance! Those Potentates their mighty eyes Have fixed: Right well that piercing glance Roof, wall, and basement tries! Foundations few that gaze can meet: Therefore the Virtues bide with few: But where they once have fixed their seat Her home Heaven fixes too! They enter now with awful grace Their acceptable dwelling-place: In tones majestical yet tender They chaunt their consecration hymn From jewelled breasts a sacred splendour Heaving through shadows dim. The rite is done: the seed is sown: Leave, each his offering, and be gone! Stay, ye for whom were raised these walls! Possession God hath ta'en: and now His guests He calls. HYMN. FOR GOOD FRIDAY. I O Lamb of God! on Whom alone Earth's penal weight of sin was thrown, Have mercy, Saviour, on Thine own. For thou art Man. The Virgin gave To Thee her breast; the earth a grave. If smiles, while Infant yet, on Thee Were found, Thy Mother knows, not we. A man, o'er Lazarus lulled asleep, With them that wept Thou too didst weep. Thy tears in dust of Salem sunk Ere yet her heart Thy blood had drunk. All griefs of mortals Thou hast known— Have mercy, Saviour, on Thine own. II O Lamb of God, on Whom was laid That debt all worlds had never paid, Have mercy, Saviour; hear and aid. For Thou art God. With God, behold, Thou sat'st upon His throne of old: Dread throne surpassing depth and height, Eternal throne, and infinite! Yet pity reached Thee there for man, Ere worlds were made, or pain began. With Abel bleeding Thou didst lie, With Isaac forth wast led to die, With Stephen stoned, and since, and yet, With all Thy Martyrs' blood art wet. III O Lamb of God, on Whom alone Earth's penal weight of sin was thrown, Have mercy, Saviour, on Thine own. Again the depths are stirred: we wait Before the shrine's forbidding gate, We stand in sable garments clad: The infant at the breast is sad. This day unconsecrated lies The Host: unblessed the Sacrifice! Tremble the altars disarrayed: The mighty temples are dismayed: Their chaunts are dead: nor lamp, nor light Save from the Sepulchres at night. IV O Lamb of God, on Whom was laid The debt all worlds had never paid, Have mercy, Saviour; hear and aid. Again rings out that sound abhorred: Again, O widowed Church, the sword Pierces thy sacred heart—the cry Of ‘Crucify Him, Crucify.’ The Priest his garment rends again; Once more blaspheme that perjured Twain; Once more the upbraiding voice foretold Peals through dark shades from gardens cold. —Prince of the Apostles! ah that we, Like thee who fall, might weep like thee! V O Lamb of God, on Whom alone Earth's penal weight of sin was thrown, Have mercy, Saviour, on Thine own. By each step along that road: By that Cross, Thine awful load: By the Hebrew women's wail: By the sponge, and lance, and nail: By Mary's martyrdom, when she In Thee died, yet offered Thee: By that mocking crowd accursed: By Thy dreadful, unquenched thirst: By Thy three hours' agony: And by that last unanswered cry— VI O Lamb of God, on Whom was laid The debt all worlds had never paid, Have mercy, Saviour, hear and aid. Like shapes at God's last trump new-risen, My sins time-buried rise—and listen. The veil is rent; the rocks are riven; And demons sweep yon darkened heaven. Three crosses bar the black on high— That Thief beside Thee hung so nigh— How rolls he now on Thee his eye; Nor sees beyond Thee hills or sky! Thus, Christ, we turn from all to Thee ‘Miserere Domine.’ HYMN. THE WASHING OF THE ALTAR ON GOOD FRIDAY. I Pour forth the wine-floods rich and dark Over the altar-stone: The time is short; the yew-trees, hark, How mournfully they moan— It is the sacred blood of Christ By angels poured o'er earth; While sable turns to amethyst And death to the new birth. II O'er all the altar pour the wine With joyful strength amain; The streams alone from God's great vine Can clear that altar's stain— It is the Saviour's wondrous blood:— The ensanguined planet now Ascends from this baptismal flood As bright as Christ's own brow. III The flood that cleanses on and in Roll, sacred brethren, roll; But Thou whose suffering purged our sin, O wash each sinful soul! It is the atoning blood of Him By Whom all worlds are shriven: Who lights with love our midnight dim And changes earth to Heaven. MAUNDY THURSDAY. THE WASHING OF THE FEET. Once more the Temple-Gates lie open wide: Onward, once more Advance the Faithful, mounting like a tide That climbs the shore. Naked as tombs the Altars stand to-day: The shrines are bare: Christ of His raiment was despoiled; and they His livery wear. This day the mighty and the proud have heard His ‘Mandate New;’ That which He did, their Master, and their Lord This day they do. This day the mitred foreheads, and the crowned In meekness bend: New tasks this day the sceptred hands have found: The Poor they tend. To-day those feet which tread in lowliest ways Yet follow Christ Are by the secular lords of power and praise Both washed and kissed. Hail Ordinance sage of hoar antiquity Which she retains That Church who teaches man how meek should be The head that reigns. SELF-SACRIFICE. I When Christ let fall that sanguine shower Amid the garden dew O say what amaranthine flower In that red rain up grew? If yet below, the blossom grow Then earth is holy yet: But if it bloom forgotten, woe To those who dare forget! II No flower so precious, sweet, and lone Expands beneath the skies: In Eden bowers it lurked unblown— Its name? Self-sacrifice! The very name we scarce can frame, And yet that secret root The monsters of the wild might tame, And Heaven is in the fruit! III Alas! what murmur spreads around? ‘The news thereof hath been: But never yet the man was found Whose eye that flower hath seen.’ Then nobles all! leave court and hall And search the wide world o'er; For whoso finds this Sancgreall Stands crowned for evermore! THE CREATION OF MAN. A RABBINICAL TRADITION. When but the first page of the Book of Fate As yet lay open—thus the Seers relate— When through the new-born woods the lion ran The pard, but eyed not yet their master, Man; When blindly worked through clay the thing that creeps; When hung, amazed, the eagle o'er the deeps; The great Creator, bending from the shore Of heaven, awhile His six days' work forbore: He willed not that like beast or bird should rise That Race whose forehead parleys with the skies; That even man's earthly garb should take its mould Save from Himself, the Eternal One of Old. Ere yet His ‘hour was come,’ the All-Wise, All-Good In human form, then first Incarnate, stood: Behind Him sank the sun o'er pastures golden; Man-shaped before Him stretched His sacred shade; He stood, He spake with sceptred hand high-holden; ‘Rise, Man, from earth in God's own Image made:’ And where that shadow on the sward was stayed Forth from his native dust ascending, Man obeyed. AN ANCIENT LEGEND, AND ITS ANSWER. [‘Through Alexandria there rushed of old, a Woman with disordered garb that held high in one hand a Torch, and in the other bore a Jar of Water, and cried aloud, saying, “With this Torch I will burn up Heaven, and with this Jar of Water I will quench Hell, that henceforward God may be loved for His own sake alone.”’] Thou Christian Mænad, with thy Torch and Jar That wouldst burn Heaven to its remotest star And quench all Hell, that thus, beneath—above— God might be God alone, and Love but Love, Too proud for gifts! dash down that Jar and Torch, And learn a lowlier wisdom from the Church. Know this, that God is Heaven: with Him who dwell Find Love's Reward perforce: and theirs is Hell, Hate's dread self-prison, who pine in endless night From God self-exiled; haters of the light. Mænad! Thy Thyrsus is no Prophet Rod: Who cancels Heaven and Hell must cancel God. TRIAL. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES. As when for weeks the tempest blinds Some sea-girt mountain, night and day, So storms of trial, clouds and winds Besieged his soul till not a ray Could reach him of that glory streamed From God upon the new-born world: An erring star and lost he seemed Through endless darkness onward hurled. At last, his large heart breaking, down He knelt his latest prayer to make, True heart that, shrivelling in the frown Of God, that God would not forsake, ‘If I must lose Thee there beneath, Lord, let me love Thee till I die!’— It sank—the black cloud's latest wreath; And God was his eternally! Sonnets. I. GOD'S GIFTS. Love to the tender; peace to those who mourn; Hope to the hopeless, hope that does not fail, Whose symbol is the anchor, not the sail; Glory that spreads to Heaven's remotest bourn And to its centre doth again return Like music; health revisiting the frail; Freedom to those who pine in dungeons pale; Sorrows which God hath willed and Christ hath worn! Omnipotence to be the poor man's shield; Light, uncreated light, to cheer the blind; Infinite mercy sent to heal and bind All wounds encountered in life's well-fought field; These are God's gifts to man;—nor these alone: Himself He gives to all who make those gifts their own. II. LAW AND GRACE. Yes, I remember: once beneath a yoke We walked, with jealous pride and painful fear: Then a stern footstep sounded ever near; And, when that Presence dread His silence broke, Austere and cold as if a statue spoke, Each marble sentence smote upon my ear; Yet ‘Thou shalt not’ was all that I could hear— Then sudden from its trance my spirit woke. The sun was rising. Floods of light divine, Golden, and crimson on the mountains played. I saw the village spire like silver shine: Eolian music filled the echoing shade: And I could hear, through all the murmuring glen, Music of moving Gods come down to live with men. III. CHURCHES. A castle strongly built, and eminent Above Time's battle-plain defaced and gory; A palace where, in robes of kingly glory Our spirits rest; among parched sands a tent; One sunlit isle in a vexed element; A gallery graced with all the pictured story Of earth and man; a high observatory Whence eyes of seers for aye on Heaven are bent:— Such is yon Church: and round its tapering spire I see, descending like a heavenly crown Immortal forms a wreathed and beautiful choir Bearing in golden urns and baskets down Angelic food; and scattering with the sound Of hymns and chaunted psalms those demons hovering round! IV. Ye praise the humble: of the meek ye say ‘Happy they live among their lowly bowers; The mountains, and the mountain-storms are ours!’ Thus, self-deceivers, filled with pride alway, Reluctant homage to the good ye pay, Mingled with scorn like poison sucked from flowers— Revere the humble! godlike are their powers: No mendicants for praise of men are they. The child who prays in faith ‘Thy will be done’ Is blended with that Will Supreme which moves A wilderness of worlds by Thought untrod; He shares the starry sceptre, and the throne: The man who as himself his neighbour loves Looks down on all things with the eyes of God! V. That depth of love the Church doth bear to thee Thou knowest not yet; for thou not yet hast felt The beatings of an infant's bosom melt Into thine own; and all that mystery Whereby, nought-seeing—caring not to see— The creature, instinct-taught, its food doth draw By a sweet pressure and benignant law Forth from its mother's breast perpetually. But, by the blessings of thy future hearth, By all its order, sanctity, and peace, Resist not Her whose meek and tearful eyes Followed the wanderer ever from Her birth; Whose shadow charmed thy sleep; whose litanies Soft as Spring's breath woke first thy soul's increase! VI. THE VASTNESS OF DIVINE TRUTH LOST IN ITS SIMPLICITY. From end to end we glance; from Adam's fall To Christ's triumphant death and victory, At once—those mysteries that between them be By man are known but scantly, if at all: And thus in time our marvel waxes small; Thus gazing down into an air-like sea Its depth eludes us from its purity, And treasures ours so cheaply vainly call For gratitude or gladness. On we go Unmoved beneath a heaven of awe-struck eyes; While purer beings, Angel minds that know The cost of that great boon which we despise Look down on us, suspended from their skies, With deeper awe than men on God bestow. VII. EVIDENCES OF RELIGION. 1. Letters there be too large for us to read: Words shouted mock the sense, and beat the air: Emblazon not in such a type thy creed: Through such a trumpet peal not thou thy prayer. Truth has her Saxon friends, of whom beware: No alien help, or haughty, doth she need: To him who seeks her, pure in heart and deed Her pledges and her proofs are everywhere. Whate'er we hear or see; whate'er doth lie Round us in Nature; all that human thought In Science, or in Art, hath found, or wrought, Stand fixed as notes on Truth's immortal book. What need we more? a Commentary? look Through all the mighty roll of History! VIII. EVIDENCES OF RELIGION.2. Ye who would build the Churches of the Lord! An ancient custom.See that ye make the western portals low: Let no one enter who disdains to bow. High Truths profanely gazed at, unadored, Will be abused at first, at last abhorred; And many a learned, many a lofty brow Hath rested, pillowed on a humbler vow Than critic ken can notice or record. O stainless peace of blest Humility! Of all who fain would enter, few, alas! Catch the true meaning of that kind, sad eye; While thou, God's portress, stationed by His door, Dost stretch thy cross so near the marble floor That children only, without bending, pass. IX. SIMPLICITY AND STEADFASTNESS OF MIND. When plain and city, garden, mount and wood Under the Flood's blank tablet lay unseen Three objects only met thy vision keen Angel of Earth! in that wild solitude; The Sun; that shining and unshadowed flood: And, heaven-ward lifted on its tide serene, The Ark, sole-drifting where a world had been— No meaner image lured thine eye from God. Our eyes are full of idols: O! that we From those soul-murdering gewgaws of the day Might turn, and fix our gaze immovably Upon God's Church, tracking its marvellous way Over the ocean of God's awful Love— And Him, that steadfast Sun which lights her from above. X. THE PENITENT. From grave to grave I pace inwardly sighing ‘Is not this place for my repentance meet?’ Borne through dark boughs the night-winds unreplying The unanswered question mournfully repeat. To you I turn, under the damp grass lying, O Friends; and pray you from your dusk retreat To breathe a spirit of sorrow holy and sweet Over this heart dried up, in silence dying. And thou, in Palestine's cold shadows sleeping 'Mid dust with tears of thine so often blent Give me one gush of thy perpetual weeping, Holy Saint Mary, ever penitent! Night after night fresh dews revive the flowers: Ah! that one Baptism should alone be ours! XI. SPIRITUAL RETREATS.(PENITENTIAL 1.) Baths of the Church! seclusions sad, yet dear! Amid your cloistral caves, and shadowy cells, That dark-stoled hermitress, Repentance, dwells, Haunting your loneliest shades with patient cheer; And agitating oft with hallowing tear The streams Bethesdal of your healing wells; Or murmuring low her grief-taught oracles For souls too weak to feel, too proud to hear. ‘Alas! world-wearied Spirits, fly no more! These springs make strong the feeble knees: these dews Efface the lines of lingering care; infuse Immortal youth through bosoms of threescore:— Draw near. The Angels shall your introit sing, Fanning your weary foreheads with assuasive wing. XII. DISCIPLINE OF THE CHURCH.(PENITENTIAL 2.) Too much of mirth—too many smiles—depart Vain phantoms of the Sense, false baits of sin! One hour for holy mourning who may win Amid the clamour of the world's loud mart? A sigh throws wide the portals of the heart: Pure Spirits enter: good resolves begin: How wholesome then that care, how kind that art The highways of man's life o'ershadowing With cypress thickets at wide intervals, And gardens bowered 'mong cedar-darkened rifts Hollowed with dewy vaults, and silent halls; Where smooth once more the sould her forehead lifts And pleasurably spreads a widening eye Shrunk up too long and dimmed by the sun's tyranny! XIII. PENITENTIAL SEASONS. ‘Large as the beads of this dark rosary Was each successive drop that slowly fell Down from the Saviour's temples, audible To the earth's beating heart. O misery! I had forgotten them! forget not me, Thou merciful Redeemer. Like a knell My sinful Past salutes me! Let me dwell Henceforth in that sad garden, Lord, with Thee.’ Even thus the Holy Church with lifted palms On her wet eyelids pressed and forehead pale Depressed beneath a dusk, funereal veil Chaunteth all night her penitential psalms: Nor from her mournful litanies can cease Until the sun shall rise and give her peace. XIV. ON A PICTURE OF THE MAGDALENE. Weeper perpetual, of whom men say Not that she lived so long, ‘but so long wept;’ And in her fond imagination crept Fearful, yet fond, to those blest feet each day: There knelt to wash them: there to wipe them lay: There in her shining locks caught them and kept: And hallowed thus, a tender love-adept, Thenceforth those glittering tresses never grey!— Fulfilled Thy Master's word hath been! Where'er Thy Lord is preached art thou remembered, making Repentance to sad hearts dear, and yet dearer. Thine eyes like heavens by midnight rains left clearer, How oft we see thee thus through deserts bare, Thy sad yet solaced way in silence taking! XV. DISCIPLINE OF THE CHURCH.(COMMEMORATIVE.) With solemn forms, benign solicitudes, But each a Sacramental type and pledge Of Grace, the Church inweaves a sheltering hedge Around her garden vale in the wild woods; Giving Heaven's calm to Nature's varying moods. She plants a cross on every pine-girt ledge: A chancel by each river's lilied edge. Where'er her Catholic dominion broods, Behold how two Infinitudes are mated, The Mighty and Minute by the control Of Love or Duty linked with care sublime! On earth no spot, no fleeting point of time, Within our mind no thought, within our soul No feeling, doth she leave unconsecrated. XVI. NATURAL RELIGION. Search ye the Heart of man until ye find That which is deepest. Raise your eyes again Up through the loftiest region of his Mind: And in each spacious, and serene domain The same calm Presence ye shall mark enshrined: The Thought of God—For pleasure, or for pain It fills the one great soul of all our kind: And Conscience to her breast this Truth doth strain. Away with blind, empiric argument To 'stablish that which is the ultimate, The ground, o'er which all other notions pass! Man may distort God's Image, not create— We dim too closely o'er the semblance bent, With our own breath pure Reason's mystic glass. XVII. INTERIOR EVIDENCES. It was not with your gold, nor with your merit You bought that peace celestial now your own. You did not those heart-quickening hopes inherit Like youthful princes born to grace a throne. These are the fruits of that eternal Spirit, Who showers His grace on Faith, and Faith alone: Whose yoke but steadies those that gently bear it, Whose Presence can but through His Gifts be shown. These are the proofs, th' assurance which you thought That you were seeking; while, intent to shun Truth's living Lord, yourself alone you sought: Now you have found yourself in Him, and won The bloodless triumphs of the fields He fought: The rest your own right hand must teach—Ride on! XVIII. CONVERSION. Loud as that trumpet doomed to raise the dead God's voice doth sometimes fall on us in fear, More often with a music low yet clear Low whispering, ‘It is I: be not afraid.’ And sometimes, mingling strangely joy with dread, It thrills the spirit's caverned sepulchre Deep as that voice which on the awe-struck ear Of him, the three-days-buried, murmuring, said ‘Come forth’—and he arose. O Christians, hail As brethren all on whom our glorious Sun At morn, or noon, or latest eve, hath shone With light, and life: and neither mourn nor rail Because one light, itself unchanging, showers A thousand colours on a thousand flowers. XIX. THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS. How many precious influences meet In this frail flower, the orphan of the year! To her the Sun, her little span to cheer, Sends down two momentary heralds, heat And light, and pours his tribute at her feet: Yea, every atom of earth's solid sphere Shoots forth attractions that concentrate here And in this lowly creature's pulses beat. Then wherefore fear that any human soul Small though it be, is worthless in His sight Whose Mercy, like His Power, is infinite? Why doubt that God's eternal Love can reach At once the vital soul of all and each; And one vast Sympathy inspire the whole? XX. NATURE AND GRACE. That Light which is the Life alone can give The living Power which makes us love the Light: Love it in Faith, and with the Godlike might Of Love, to Love's one object cling and cleave: But we can only have what we receive. By conscience taught man's eye discerns the Right; But this we lack—the strength to scale its height That we with it might dwell, and in it live. Science and Song, their constellated wings Waving from Eastern unto Western skies, Soar but to sink. Not any bird that flies Mounts straight ascending—Grace, and Grace alone Shoots heavenward, as from yonder altar-stone The sacrificial flame triumphant springs! SONNETS BY THE LATE HON STEPHEN E. SPRING RICE. I have been again permitted to enrich this volume with a series of sonnets by the late Stephen E. Spring Rice. To those who knew him the beauty of many will be no surprise, though they lacked his last corrections. Friends less intimate will be pleased at discovering how compatible are poetic power, imaginative emotion, and refined thought, with habits of business, and the most ardent practical energies directed to their most generous and dutiful ends. 1861. I. With slow and thoughtful step I went my way Through new-mown meadows, crowded pastures green, On the ‘Hawk's Cliff,’ in thickets deep, unseen, Without a friend to pass the summer's day. Browning's Drama.I read of murdered Strafford as I lay, Of timid, faithless Charles, of Pym serene Though mourning for the friend whose youth had been Brightened, like his, with Freedom's purest ray. Did Friendship earn from Charles no better fate? Could not strong Friendship something then avail, And Justice from her claims on Pym abate? —Then rather let me listen to the gale Ruffling the sunlit foliage, and create A world of friends unseen than trust to those who fail. Curragh Chase, August 17, 1837. II. THE BLACK TARN UNDER MANGERTON. With quicker coming breath and shorter stride We reached at length the level, purple height Which seemed from far unto our straining sight The crown of that calm monarch's silent pride; But, when we paused, we heard a petty tide Hoarse, low, monotonous; and, dark as night, A sullen lake lay shadowed by the might Of rugged cliffs that bound its further side. How fit an emblem of the mind whose share Of life is solitude and selfish thought Gloomy, and murmuring on a barren strand! Mine be a bay by eager breezes fanned; And not by tempest into anger wrought Though Ocean's pulse is ever throbbing there! January 22, 1838. III. EARLY FRIENDSHIP. The half-seen memories of childish days When pains and pleasures lightly came, and went; The sympathies of boyhood rashly spent In fearful wanderings through forbidden ways; The vague, but manly, wish to tread the maze Of life to noble ends: whereon intent, Asking to know for what man here is sent, The bravest heart must often pause, and gaze— The firm resolve to seek the chosen end Of manhood's judgment, cautious and mature: Each of these viewless bonds binds friend to friend With strength no selfish purpose can secure;— My happy lot is this, that all attend That friendship which first came, and which shall last endure. IV. DRUDGERY. Pleasant it is, at close of weary day, When all is out of sight that vexed the mind To dull routine or petty task confined,— Pleasant with intermitting chat to say ‘This easy converse fully doth repay The morning's labour.’ Search! and you shall find That only toil upon some work assigned Can fit foundation for such leisure lay. My friends are gone; these things I think and feel, As o'er the dewy grass a path I make: Some distant waggon with its labouring wheel Betrays the silence which it seems to break; Slow, heavy perfumes o'er the garden steal; The flickering branches in the moonbeam shake. V. TITIAN'S PICTURE OF BACCHUS AND ARIADNE. Young Ariadne, by her lover led Through narrow mountain pass, or woodland glade Rich with a thousand flowers, loved the shade That o'er her modest steps a veil outspread: Now, with slow tears she mourns that lover fled: Her golden hair, half fallen from the braid, Hath but a wavering protection made For the fair brow; and from her glossy head The sunbeams glance. Alone she walks the shore;— When suddenly is thronged that barren place, And youthful Bacchus, like a bursting wave Leaps from his panther car with headlong grace. —And will his godlike raptures please her more Than calmer joys her mortal lover gave? August 20, 1843. VI. MARY SAYING HER PRAYERS.1. Wilful and dull and sullen seems that child; But who in that soft countenance can find An index to the thoughts that fret her mind? By no long-cherished hope was she beguiled? Has no uncertain vision gleamed and smiled, Then faded from her eyelids? Had the wind, Circling the world, no messages consigned To her young heart this morning sweet and mild, When with the dawn it touched upon her brow? By recollections flickering, undefined, Perhaps she may be haunted even now; By dim and shapeless aspirations vexed, With infantile experiences entwined; By half-seen truths surprised, alarmed, perplexed August 15, 1846. VII. 2. Slow serious phrases, tender words and few The mother whispered in a voice subdued, Gently submitting to the wayward mood Which from her loving watchfulness she knew Would fade away, and by observance due Be soon succeeded; no abrupt or rude Commandment was she forward to intrude; The instinct of affection, ever true To loftiest conceptions of the mind, Prompted such patience and respect for those Who tho' on earth and to our care consigned Are yet angelic. Seeing them, she knows What loveliness might shine in humankind If still unstained by sin, unworn by woes. August 28, 1846. VIII. OLD AND MODERN LEARNING. The learning of old times was as a stream Through many an untrod glen that held its way, Smooth-flowing, clear, and silent as a dream To the calm precincts of a cloister grey; In which the sculptured fount would doubtless seem A Station fit, where holy men each day Might read the gracious Word, and muse, and pray, ‘Send us the living water, Lord Supreme!’ The learning of these days doth rush along By humblest hut and proudest palace bowers, Like a broad torrent, troubled, loud, and strong; Each sloping bank, throughout the circling hours, Is crowded by an eager, restless throng— They crush to dust the few remaining flowers. IX. Love is historic; rests upon the past; Still lingers lovingly on old detail; Still, like the holy bells, rings out a tale For ever new, from earliest to last: Love is prophetic; climbing still the mast Discerns of distant hope the signal pale, And on the straining spar extends the sail Withheld by colder counsels from the blast. Mysterious delight in what is lost! Wild half fruition of what may be won By struggling perseverance, tempest-toss'd! Yet love in silence wrapt and deep repose, Whilst one short hour its hasty course can run, May find more joy than many a lifetime knows! X. Think not man's fallen nature can accept, Or, if accepting, value at their worth Rites that lack splendour; slave of grief or mirth By fleshly lusts he is in hondage kept. Far less believe that splendid rites give birth To heartfelt sorrow, such as his, who ‘wept And smote upon his breast,’ for this man stept With downcast eyes, not heeding aught on earth. Man must employ in worship every power, Will, reason, understanding, heart, and sense; And should he on some dull or fond pretence Neglect but one, then from devotion's flower He cuts a leaf that drank the heavenly dew, Or root, that purity from baseness drew. XI. If, task'd beyond my strength, I crave delay And weakly wish that to another hand Had been committed what divine command Has sent to mine; if on th' appointed way I pause, and, thoughtless of my purpose, stray; If, wearied with the men, the clime, the land Which I call mine, I seek another strand, That on the wings of chance I lightly may Outstrip the homely cares which day by day Hum in my ears; if by myself I stand Accused of all these faults, and cannot say That I less subject am unto their sway Now than of old—you needs must understand How rashly upon me new duties would you lay. XII. Soft sighing wind that comest to dispel The rigid bond that holds the buds so long As almost to provoke a sense of wrong In those who now have sadly watched them swell Slowly, for weeks; O, would that I could tell How deep the joy thou bringest, and how strong! O that I too could blossom into song, And hail thee loosen'd from thy southern cell Whilst all surrounding Nature seems to smile And bare her breast at thy sunbright approach! O, wherefore hast thou tarried so long while? Dear spirit! tenderly must I reproach Thee, dallying upon the Italian shore Or launching thence across the purple, smooth sea floor. XIII. No sweeter pleasure can this life supply Than what my darling children daily bring To me, well wearied of that noisy thing We call society: without a sigh— Nay, gladly—I would cast ambition by, Content to hear their eager questioning (The chirping of young birds that cannot sing), To weigh for them the words of my reply, And righteously instruct them—I should rest Like the worn ship in harbour there below, Which, safe from struggling on the Ocean's breast, Floats in the silent water—what a glow The setting sun casts on her tricolor crest! She hears far off waves toss and tempests blow. Jardin Marengo, Algiers: January 28, 1855. XIV. SYMPATHY DISPENSED WITH. And if indeed I wear my soul away, And pour my heart out upon barren stones, And vainly try to vivify dead bones, And through dry deserts hunt a worthless prey; If, disappointed, thus from men I stray, And strive to find a meaning in the tones, The half-heard whispers and the sullen moans, In which unfeeling Nature seems to say, But says most falsely, that in her doth dwell A sympathetic beating of the heart, Should then myself against myself rebel, And dream of a self-centred life apart, Myself shall blame myself: all may be well: Love, without self-love soothes the bitterest smart. February 8, 1857. XV. THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN BITTERNESS. We sat together underneath a lime, Whose netted branches wove an emerald night; And in short sentences—in low and light Whispers—recalled the stories of old time: Until some word, I know not what, some rhyme Dragged out a hidden grief, that lived—in spite Of creeping lichen years—such years as might Well humble all that once was thought sublime. My grief it was, and will be: she but sees A strangeness which she cannot understand; A nameless tower overgrown with trees; A heap of stones encumbering the land; A hearth now haunted by the wintry breeze, Long, long ago, by love and fancy fanned. January 19, 1858. XVI. ‘The spacious Shenan, spreading like a sea,’ Lies far below, beyond the lawn and wood, That, tender green, this, rich in purple bud; And, hidden from the sight by bush and tree, I hear a tinkling streamlet fall and flee Through the deep glen to seek that distant flood; Soft airs escape from the hill-side and scud, With gentle touches, bird-like, wild, and free, Across that glassy bosom. All is peace. Would that with me such calm might ever dwell! That I might live content, nor seek release From cares appointed; never feel the swell Of vague ambition; dream of no increase In wealth or power; well loved, and loving well! Mount Trenchard: April 6, 1860. XVII. SICK DREAMS ALL.WRITTEN IN SICKNESS. The spirit worn with sickness walks thro' vales Of shadowy meaning, elbowed by a flow And ceaseless throng of ghastly forms, that show Some fleeting token, which, tho' light, assails The memory, and rends aside its veils; Or through some ebon vault, set deep below, With outstretched hands and stumbling step and slow, The sick man's fancy wanders; or he sails Upon a smooth broad sea; some unseen hand Directs the helm and gives a steady run; His languid eye perceives no distant land; He knows not of his journey; if begun But now, or ending, cannot understand; But sails toward a drooping blood-red sun. April 1861. XVIII. THE DREAM OF A LIFE.WRITTEN IN SICKNESS. I wander in a thick-set wood alone— Tall, naked boles of trees around me crowd, And overhead their branches weave a shroud For the dead earth: ever I hear the moan Of the sharp winter wind, or else the groan Of some old tree that in past tempests bowed And shaken to the root betrays aloud Its coming fall. I find no friendly stone That measures distance in this dreary wild; No path is obvious to my drooping eyes; Days, weeks, and years have gone since on me smiled Unbroken light above; I sit, and rise; Lie down or wander aimless: hope is gone; Escape from this dark forest there is none. June 1861. XIX. ‘HOLD UP, OLD HORSE!’ The exile pacing o'er the Russian plain To that far East where he must waste his life, Exhausted with the long and passionate strife Whose failure earned this fate, can not retain Or fix the thoughts which flit across his brain; His memory with formless clouds is rife, Of youth and home—of children and of wife— Lost in a haze of dull and leaden pain: So I, ere half my day is spent, outworn, And stepping surely towards an early end, But dimly see the promise of my morn, Though far unlike that wretched one forlorn;— Lovers and friends my failing steps attend; And I can welcome all that God may send. March 4, 1864. XX. SPRING. Long wished-for, bursts in gladness the new year, Sweetness and beauty freely sheds around, And hides anew the sullen withered ground With tender verdure, whilst from far and near The song of birds crowds thick upon the ear, Perplexing sense with multitudinous sound; No jealous laws are felt that tie and bound The bounteousness of Nature, no sad fear Of late born frosts her genial step delays: As friend to friend his hoarded thought betrays, Long chilled and frozen by the mastering need Of sympathy, and finds both that and praise, So spring is welcome in each flower and weed, Lavish in love, and fearless in her ways. May 12, 1864. XXI. TO LINA. The night is soft as under southern skies; The garden is deserted, save by me; Whilst ever and anon a gleam I see Flash from the house, perplexing my old eyes; For one short moment on the lawn it lies, Then into ghostly being brings a tree Unseen before—the murmur of the sea Steals through the branches. But a glad surprise Absorbs all these delights, and gives its own; From the sweet south leaps out a gracious wind, Fresh, strong, and soothing, stirring in the mind Old thoughts and new, by its elastic tone;— Such and so sudden was, on seeing you, My joy to-day; ah! moments dear and few! August 4, 1864. XXII. LEFT ALONE. The sea-gulls glancing o'er the glittering wave Are now my sole companions: and indeed, When questioned, I replied I had no need Of others. Vain my boast! ah! vainly brave From past experience, when warm pulses gave An inner strength that either took no heed Of outward circumstance, or let it lead By seeming chance to thoughts or gay or grave. But now a leaden heart has lost its spring And must renew its impulse from without. Whenso my darling children crowd about, And their swift thoughts wheel by upon the wing, Strong in their strength, I follow in their flight: One after one they pass; and then comes dreary night. Gibraltar Bay, on board the ‘Sidon’: November 25, 1864. XXIII. EDIFICATION.ON THE BAPTISM OF AN INFANT IN ST. PETER'S. If this vast building had been reared for nought But as a temple where this solemn rite Might be completed, still the hands that wrought Its stately walls, the intellectual might Of its great architect, the wealth that brought Art's choicest treasures had been used aright, Clothing with fitting dignity the thought That on man's heart God's Spirit doth alight. Yet it may happen that this helpless child Should far surpass the wonder here achieved, Leading a life of virtue, pure and mild, By this world's shallow splendour undeceived, May build in many hearts shrines undefiled With bright examples from his life received. XXIV. THE BABY ON THE RUG. The sky that was in purity divine When the fresh dawn crept down upon the bay, Is harried now with clouds, nor comes a ray Of hope;—of peace and happiness no sign. Against the silver sky, a brighter line The sea-horizon drew, and with the day Grew brighter still, and broader, till the sway Of those swift clouds seemed all things to consign To gloom and trouble. Turn, O turn and see A purity untroubled by a cloud; A sweeter smile than from the glittering sea:— Though this angelic nature may be bowed By grief and pain, I dare to prophesy All soiling sin will from its presence fly. Spezia: December 26, 1864. POEMS FOR THE MOST PART CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT IRISH FAMINE, 1846—1849. TO THOSE WHO LABOURED FOR THE POOR OF IRELAND IN THE DAY OF THEIR DISTRESS. Sonnets. IRISH COLONIZATION. WRITTEN DURING IRELAND'S ‘GREAT FAMINE.’ I Fell the tall pines. Thou nobler Argo, leap Wide-winged deliverer, on the ocean floods; And westward waft the astonished multitudes That rot inert and hideous Sabbath keep Or, stung to madness, guiltier ruin heap On their own heads. No longer fabled Gods Subdue vext waves with tridents and pearl rods; Yet round that bark heroic, Gods shall sweep And guard an infant Nation. Hope shall flush With far Hesperean welcome billows hoary: Valour and virtue, love and joy, and glory A storm-borne Iris, shall before you rush; And there descending, where your towers shall stand Look back full faced and shout, ‘Britannia, land!’ II I heard, in deep prophetic trance immersed, The wave, keel-cut kissing the ship's dark side: Anon men shouted and the cliffs replied: O what a vision from the darkness burst! Europe so fair a city never nursed As met me there! It clasped in crescent wide The gulf, it crowned the isles, the subject tide O'er-strode with bridges and with quays coerced. In marble from unnumbered mountains robed, With altar-shaped Acropolis and crest There sat the queenly City throned and globed: Full well that beaming countenance expressed The soul of a great People. From its eye Shone forth a second Britain's empery. III How looks a mother on her babe, a bard On some life-laboured song? With humble pride And self-less love and joy to awe allied: So should a State that severed self regard, Her child beyond the waves. Great Nature's ward, And Time's, that child one day with God for guide, Shall waft its parent's image far and wide; Yea, and its Maker's if by sin unmarred. Conquest I deem a vulgar pastime: trade Shifts like the winds; and power but comes to go; But this is glorious, o'er the earth to sow The seed of Nations; darkness to invade With light; to plant, where silence reigned and death The thrones of British Law and towers of Christian Faith. IV England, magnanimous art thou in name: Magnanimous in nature once thou wert; But that which ofttimes lags behind desert And crowns the dead, as oft survives it—fame. Can she whose hand a merchant's pen makes tame Or sneer of nameless scribe; can she whose heart In camp or senate still is at the mart A Nation's toils a Nation's honours claim? Thy shield of old torn Poland twice and thrice Invoked: thy help as vainly Ireland asks Pointing with stark, lean finger, from the crest Of western cliffs plague-stricken to the West Grey-haired though young. When heat is sucked from ice, Then shall a Firm discharge a Nation's tasks. For the very large Private Charities of England during the Famine Years, Ireland has ever been grateful. Neither did the public policy then adopted lack liberality. But, in spite of the warnings of Ireland's wisest sons, grievous mistakes were made. THE YEAR OF SORROW—IRELAND—1849. I.—SPRING. I Once more, through God's high will, and grace Of hours that each its task fulfils, Heart-healing Spring resumes her place The valley throngs and scales the hills; II In vain. From earth's deep heart o'ercharged The exulting life runs o'er in flowers; The slave unfed is unenlarged: In darkness sleep a Nation's powers. III Who knows not Spring? Who doubts, when blows Her breath, that Spring is come indeed? The swallow doubts not; nor the rose That stirs, but wakes not; nor the weed. IV I feel her near but see her not; For these with pain uplifted eyes Fall back repulsed, and vapours blot The vision of the earth and skies. V I see her not: I feel her near, As, charioted in mildest airs She sails through yon empyreal sphere And in her arms and bosom bears VI That urn of flowers and lustral dews Whose sacred balm, o'er all things shed Revives the weak, the old renews And crowns with votive wreaths the dead. VII Once more the cuckoo's call I hear; I know, in many a glen profound The earliest violets of the year Rise up like water from the ground. VIII The thorn I know once more is white; And, far down many a forest dale The anemones in dubious light Are trembling like a bridal veil. IX By streams released that singing flow From craggy shelf through sylvan glades The pale narcissus, well I know, Smiles hour by hour on greener shades. X The honeyed cowslip tufts once more The golden slopes; with gradual ray The primrose stars the rock and o'er The wood-path strews its milky way. XI From ruined huts and holes come forth Old men, and look upon the sky! The Power Divine is on the earth: Give thanks to God before ye die! XII And ye, O children worn and weak Who care no more with flowers to play Lean on the grass your cold, thin cheek, And those slight hands, and whispering, say, XIII ‘Stern Mother of a race unblest, In promise kindly, cold in deed, Take back, O Earth, into thy breast The children whom thou wilt not feed.’ II.—SUMMER. I Approved by works of love and might The Year, consummated and crowned, Has scaled the zenith's purple height And flings his robe the earth around. II Impassioned stillness—fervours calm— Brood vast and bright o'er land and deep: The warrior sleeps beneath the palm; The dark-eyed captive guards his sleep. III The Iberian labourer rests from toil; Sicilian virgins twine the dance; Laugh Tuscan vales in wine and oil; Fresh laurels flash from brows of France. IV Far off in regions of the North The hunter drops his winter fur; Sun-stricken babes their feet stretch forth; And nested dormice feebly stir. V But thou, O land of many woes! What cheer is thine? Again the breath Of proved Destruction o'er thee blows And sentenced fields grow black in death. VI In horror of a new despair His blood-shot eyes the peasant strains With hands clenched fast and lifted hair Along the daily-darkening plains. VII Behold, O People! thou shalt die! What art thou better than thy sires? The hunted deer a weeping eye Turns on his birthplace, and expires. VIII Lo! as the closing of a book Or statue from its base o'erthrown Or blasted wood or dried-up brook Name, race, and nation, thou art gone. IX The stranger shall thy hearth possess; The stranger build upon thy grave. But know this also—he, not less His limit and his term shall have. X Once more thy volume open cast In thunder forth shall sound thy name; Thy forest, hot at heart, at last God's breath shall kindle into flame. XI Thy brook dried up a cloud shall rise And stretch an hourly widening hand In God's high judgement through the skies And onward o'er the Invader's land. XII Of thine, one day, a remnant left Shall raise o'er earth a Prophet's rod And teach far coasts of Faith bereft The names of Ireland, and of God. III.—AUTUMN. I Then die, thou Year; thy work is done: The work ill done is done at last; Far off, beyond that sinking sun Which sets in blood, I hear the blast II That sings thy dirge, and says, ‘Ascend, And answer make amid thy peers Since all things here must have an end, Thou latest of the famine years!’ III I join that voice. No joy have I In all thy purple and thy gold Nor in that nine-fold harmony From forest on to forest rolled; IV Nor in that stormy western fire, Which burns on ocean's gloomy bed, And hurls as from a funeral pyre A glare that strikes the mountain's head; V And writes on low-hung clouds its lines Of cyphered flame with hurrying hand, And flings amid the topmost pines That crown the steep a burning brand. VI Make answer, Year, for all thy dead, Who found not rest in hallowed earth, The widowed wife, the father fled The babe age-stricken from its birth. VII Make answer, Year, for virtue lost, For courage proof 'gainst fraud and force Now waning like a noontide ghost, Affections poisoned at their source. VIII The labourer spurned his lying spade; The yeoman spurned his useless plough; The pauper spurned the unwholesome aid Obtruded once exhausted now. IX Dread Power Unknown! Whom mortal years Nor touch, nor tempt; Who sitt'st sublime In night of night, O bid thy spheres Resound at last a funeral chime! X Call up at last the afflicted race Whose Sorrow nears its ending.—Sore, For centuries, their strife: the place That knew them once shall know no more! IV.—WINTER. I Fall, snow, and cease not! Flake by flake The decent winding-sheet compose: Thy task is just and pious; make An end of blasphemies and woes. II Fall flake by flake! by thee alone Last friend, the sleeping draught is given: Kind nurse, by thee the couch is strewn The couch whose covering is from heaven. III Descend and clasp the mountain's crest; Inherit plain and valley deep: This night on thy maternal breast A vanquished nation dies in sleep. IV Lo! from the starry Temple Gates Death rides and bears the flag of peace: The combatants he separates; He bids the wrath of ages cease. V Descend, benignant Power! But O Ye torrents, shake no more the vale, Dark streams, in silence seaward flow: Thou rising storm remit thy wail. VI Shake not, to-night, the cliffs of Moher Nor Brandon's base, rough sea! Thou Isle, The Rite proceeds! From shore to shore Hold in thy gathered breath the while. VII Fall, snow! in stillness fall, like dew On church's roof and cedar's fan; And mould thyself on pine and yew And on the awful face of man. VIII Without a sound, without a stir, In streets and wolds, on rock and mound O, omnipresent Comforter By thee, this night, the lost are found! IX On quaking moor, and mountain moss With eyes upstaring at the sky And arms extended like a cross The long-expectant sufferers lie. X Bend o'er them, white-robed Acolyte! Put forth thine hand from cloud and mist! And minister the last sad Rite, Where altar there is none, nor priest. XI Touch thou the gates of soul and sense; Touch darkening eyes and dying ears; Touch stiffening hands and feet, and thence Remove the trace of sins and tears. XII And ere thou seal those filmèd eyes Into God's urn thy fingers dip, And lay, 'mid eucharistic sighs, The sacred wafer on the lip. XIII This night the Absolver issues forth: This night the Eternal Victim bleeds: O winds and woods! O heaven and earth! Be still this night. The Rite proceeds! WIDOWHOOD. 1848. Not thou alone, but all things fair and good Live here bereft in vestal widowhood Or wane in radiant circlet incomplete. Memory, in widow's weeds, with naked feet Stands on a tombstone. Hope, with tearful eyes Stares all night long on unillumined skies. Virtue, an orphan, begs from door to door: Beside a cold hearth on a stranger's floor Sits exiled Honour. Song, a vacant type Hangs on that tree, whose fruitage ne'er was ripe Her harp, and bids the casual wind thereon Lament what might be, fabling what is gone. Our childhood's world of wonder melts like dew; Youth's guardian genius bids our youth adieu And oft the wedded is a widow too. The best of bridals here is but a troth; Only in heaven is ratified the oath: There, there alone, is clasped in full fruition That sacred joy which passed not Eden's gates, For here the soul is mocked with dream and vision, And outward sense, uniting, separates. The Bride of Brides, a maid and widow here, Invokes her Lord, and finds—a Comforter: Her loftiest fane is but a visible porch To sealed Creation's omnipresent Church. Zealous that nobler gifts than earth's should live Fortune I praise; but praise her, fugitive. The Roman praised her permanent; ‘Laudo manentem.’—Horace. but we Have learned her lore, and paid a heavy fee, Have tracked her promise to its brake of wiles, And sounded all the shallows of her smiles. Fortune not gives but sells, and takes instead A heart made servile, and a discrowned head. Too soon she comes, and drowns in swamps of sloth The soul contemplative and active; both; Or comes too late and, with malignant art Leaps on the lance that rives the sufferer's heart Showering her affluence on a breast supine. Her best of gifts the usurer's seal and sign Sustain, and pawn man's life to Destiny. Ah! mightier things than man like man can die! Between the ruin and the work half done I sit: the raw wreck is the sorrier one. Here drops old Desmond's Keep in slow decay: There the unfinished Mole is washed away. The moment's fickle promise, and the vast And consummated greatness, both are past. We sink, and none is better for our fall: We suffer most: but suffering comes to all: Our sighs but echoes are of earlier sighs; And in our agonies we plagiarize. O'er all the earth old States in ruin lie, And new Ambitions topple from their sky: Greatness walks lame while clad in mortal mould; The good are weak: unrighteous are the bold. Love by Self-love is murdered, or Distrust; And earth-born Virtue has its ‘dust to dust.’ This Ireland knows. The famine years go by, And each its ranks of carnage heaps more high: What voice once manly and what hand once strong Arraigns, resists, or mitigates the wrong? The future shall be as the present hour: The havoc past, again the slaves of Power Shall boast because once more the harvest waves In fraudulent brightness o'er a million graves. Why weep for ties once ours, relaxed or broken? If weep we must, our tears are all bespoken: One thing is worthy of them, one alone— A world's inherent baseness; and our own. Type of my country, sad, and chaste, and wise! Forgive the gaze of too regardful eyes: I saw the black robe, and the aspect pale And heard in dream that country's dying wail. Like Night her form arose: as shades in night Are lost thy sorrowing beauty vanished from my sight. THE LAST IRISH GAEL TO THE LAST IRISH NORMAN; OR, THE LAST IRISH CONFISCATION. A PREDICTION, 1848. Your bark in turn is freighted. O'er the seas You seek a refuge at the Antipodes. Australia waits you. O my Lord, beware! Australia! Floats not England's standard there? Tyrconnell and Tyrone found rest more nigh: Shrined on St. Peter's Mount St. Pietro in Montorio. their ashes lie. Their cause is mine—and foes, till now, were we; Now friends, ashamed were I thy shame to see. Has Ruin no decorum? Grief no sense? Shall England house thee? England drives thee hence! O worker of thy sorrows with a vow Bind thou that head reduced, and careful brow Wholly to root that idol from thy heart: Swear that thy race never shall have a part In aught that England boasts, achieves, confers: Her past is thine—thy future is not hers. Loosed from the agony of fruitless strife You stand, a lost man 'mid the wreck of life And round you gaze. Sad Eva also gazed All round that bridal field of blood, amazed; Spoused to new fortunes. But your head is grey! Beyond your castle droops the dying day; And, drifting down loose gusts of wailing wind, Night comes with rain before and frost behind. Lean men that groped for sea-weeds on the shore All day, now hide in holes on fen and moor. The cliffs lean forth their brows to meet the scourge Of blast on blast: around their base the surge Welters in shades from iron headlands thrown: Through chasm and cave subaqueous thunders moan— That sound thou lov'st! Once more the Desmonds fall: To-night old Wrongs shake hands in History's hall; And, clashing through responsive vaults of Time, Old peals funereal marry chime to chime. Of such no more! Beside your fireless hearth Sit one night yet: and, moody or in mirth Compare the past and present, and record The fortunes of your Order in a word. England first used, then spurned it! Hour by hour, For centuries her laws, her fame, her power Hung on its hand. It gloried to sustain High o'er the clouds that sweep the Atlantic main, The banner with her blazonries enrolled: Then came the change, and ye were bought and sold: Then came the change, and ye received your due. Sir, to your country had ye proved as true As to your England, she had held by you: Ruin ye might have proved; ye might have known Even then, the scorn of others—not your own! Pardon hard words. Your Race, not mine, is hard: But wounds and work the hand too soft have scarred: We are your elders—first-born in distress; And century-seasoned woes grow pitiless. Hierarchs are we in pain, where ye but learn: We have an Unction, and our Rite is stern. If on our brows still hang ancestral glooms, Forgive the children of the Catacombs. What have the dead to do with love or ruth? I died; and live once more—I live for Truth: Hope and delusion trouble me no more: Therefore, expatriate on my native shore Anguish and doubt shake other nerves, not mine: I drop no tear into the bitter brine: The world in which I move is masculine. Why to Australia? Britain too was dear: Must, then, the Britain of the southern sphere Rack you in turn? Seek you once more to prove The furies of a scorned, unnatural love That cleaves to insult and on injury feeds And, upon both cheeks stricken, burns and bleeds? Son of the North, why seek you not once more The coasts where sang the warrior Scald of yore? If unhistoric regions you must tread, Hallowed by no communion with the dead, Never by saint, or sage, or hero trod; Where never lifted fane upraised to God In turn, the hearts of sequent generations, Where never manly races rose to nations Marshalled by knightly arm or kingly eye; If with new fortunes a new earth you try, Then seek, oh, seek her in her purity! Drain not civilization's dregs and lees. In many an island clipt by tropic seas, Nature keeps yet a race by arts untamed, Who live half-innocent and unashamed. Ambition frets not them. In regions calm Mid prairies vast, or under banks of palm, They sing light wars and unafflicting loves And vanish as the echo leaves the groves! Smooth space divides their cradles and their graves: What are they? Apparitions—casual waves Heaved up in Time's successive harmony! Brief smiles of nature followed by a sigh! Why not with such abide awhile and die? O, summoned ere thy death to that repose The grave concedes to others! by thy foes Franchised with that which friendship never gave; A heart as free from tremors as the grave! Last of a race whose helm and lance were known In furthest lands—now exiled from thine own— Give thanks! How many a sight is spared to thee Which we, thy sires in suffering, saw and see! Thou hast beheld thy country, by the shocks Of sequent winters, driven upon the rocks High and more high. Thou shalt not, day by day, See her dismembered planks, the wrecker's prey Abused without remorse to uses base: Thou hast beheld the home of all thy race Their lawns, their walks, and every grove and stream Their very tombs—pass from thee like a dream And leave thee bare. But thou shalt not behold Thy woods devastated, nor gathering mould Subdue the arms high hung and blight the bloom Of pomps heraldic redd'ning scroll and tomb; Nor the starred azure touched by mists cold-lipped Till choir and aisle are black as vault and crypt, Nor from the blazoned missal wane and faint The golden age of martyr, maid, and saint, Umbria's high pathos, and the Tuscan might And all thy wondering childhood's world of light. Thou shalt not see that Cross thou loved'st so well From minster towers rock-built, and hermit's cell Swept by the self-same blast that sent the hind Shivering to caves, and struck a kingdom blind! All that was thine, while seas between thee roll And them, in some still cloister of thy soul Shall live, as, in a mother's heart inisled Lives on the painless memory of a child Buried a babe. One image all shall make Still as the gleam of sunset-lighted lake Kenned from a tower o'er leagues of wood and lawn; Or as perchance our planet looks, withdrawn From some pure spirit that leaves her; to his sight Lessening, not lost—a disk of narrowing light Sole-hung in regions of pure space afar— Of old the world he lived in, now a star! But the wind swells yon sails. Why waste we breath? My Lord, for thy soul's sake, and a good death Forget the things a Gael's unmannered pen For thee records not but for later men. Since hope is gone, let peace be thine instead. The snows which heap too soon that Norman head, Should calm it, and a heart that bleeds for aye Has less to lose, and less to feel, each day. Seek not thy joys when on the desolate shore The raked rocks thunder, and the caverns roar, And the woods moan, while shoots the setting sun Discords of angry lights o'er billows dun. Make white thy thoughts as is a Vestal's sleep; Bloodless: prolong, beside the murmuring deep, Thy matutinal slumbers, till the bird That tuned not broke them, is no longer heard. The flowers the children of the Stranger bring Indulgent take: permit their latest Spring To lure from thee all bitterness and wrath: Into Death's bosom, genial as a bath Sink back absolved. Justice to God belongs: Soul latest-stricken, leave with Him thy Wrongs! Justice, o'er angels and o'er men supreme Still in mid heaven sustains her balanced beam, With whose vast scales, whether they sink or rise, The poles of earth are forced to sympathize. Unseen she rules, wrapped round in cloud and awe; Her silence is the seal of mortal law; Her voice the harmony of every sphere: Most distant is she ever yet most near, Most strong when least regarded. From her eyes That light goes forth which cheers the brave and wise; And in the arm that lifts aloft her sword Whatever might abides on earth is stored. Fret not thyself. Watch thou, and wait, her hand! The thunder-drops fall fast. In every land Humanity breathes quick, and coming storm Looks through man's soul with flashes swift and warm: The fiery trial and the shaken sieve Shall prove the nations. What can live shall live. Falsehood shall die; and falsehoods widest-based Shall lie the lowest, though they fall the last. Down from the mountain of their greatness hurled What witness bear the Nations to the World? Down rolled like rocks along the Alpine stairs What warning voice is theirs, and ever theirs? Their ears the Nations unsubverted close For who would hear the voice whose words are Woes? Woe to ancestral greatness, if the dower Of knightly worth confirm no more its power. Woe to commercial strength, if sensual greed Heap up like waves its insolent gold, nor heed What solid good rewards the poor man's toil. Woe to the Monarch, if the unholy oil Of smooth-tongued flattery be his balm and chrism. Woe to the State cleft through by social schism. Woe to Religion, when the birds obscene Of Heresy from porch to altar-screen Range free; while from the temple-eaves look down Doubt's shadowy brood, ill-masked in cowl or gown. Woe to the Rulers by the People ruled: A People drowned in sense, and pride-befooled Trampling were sages once, and martyrs, trod. Ye Nations meet your doom, or serve at last your God! Irish Odes. I. AFTER ONE OF IRELAND'S FAMINE YEARS. I The golden dome, the Tyrian dye And all that yearning ocean Yields from red caves to glorify Ambition, or devotion I leave them—leave the bank of Seine, And those high towers that shade it To tread my native fields again, And muse on glories faded. II The monumental city stands Around me in its vastness Girdling the spoils of all the lands In war's imperial fastness. That stony scroll of every clime Some record boasts or sample; Cathedral piles of oldest time Huge arch and pillared temple. III They charge across the field of Mars; The earth beneath them shaking As breaks a rocket into stars The columned host is breaking: It forms: it bursts:—new hosts succeed: They sweep the Tuileries under: The thunder from the Invalides Answers the people's thunder. IV Behold! my heart is otherwhere, My soul these pageants cheer not: A cry from famished vales I hear, That cry which others hear not. Sad eyes, as of a noontide ghost, Whose grief, not grace, first won me, 'Mid regal pomps ye haunt me most: There most your power is on me. V Last night, what time the convent shades Far-stretched, the pavement darkened Where rose but late the barricades Alone I stood, and hearkened; Thy dove-note, O my country, thine, In long-drawn modulation, Went by me, linked with words divine That stayed all earthly passion! VI A man entranced, and yet scarce sad, Since then I see in vision The scenes whereof my boyhood had Possession, not fruition. Dark shadows sweep the landscape o'er Each other still pursuing; And lights from sinking suns once more Grow golden round the ruin. VII Dark violet hills extend their chains Athwart the saffron even, Pure purple stains not distant plains: And earth is mixed with heaven: One cloud o'er half the sunset broods; And from its ragged edges The wine-black shower descends like floods Down dashed from diamond ledges. VIII Through rifted fanes the damp wind sweeps, Chanting a dreary psalter: I see the bones that rise in heaps Where rose of old the altar; Once more beside the blessed well I see the cripple kneeling: I hear the broken chapel bell Where organs once were pealing. IX I come, and bring not help, for God Withdraws not yet the chalice: Still on your plains by martyrs trod And o'er your hills and valleys, His name a suffering Saviour writes— Letters black-drawn, and graven On lowly huts, and castled heights, Dim haunts of newt and raven. X I come, and bring not song; for why Should grief from fancy borrow? Why should a lute prolong a sigh, Sophisticating sorrow? Dull opiates, down! To wind and wave, Lethean weeds I fling you: Anacreontics of the grave, Not mine the heart to sing you! XI I come the breath of sighs to breathe, Yet add not unto sighing To kneel on graves, yet drop no wreath On those in darkness lying. Sleep, chaste and true, a little while, The Saviour's flock, and Mary's: And guard their reliques well, O Isle, Thou chief of reliquaries! XII Blessed are they that claim no part In this world's pomp and laughter: Blessed the pure; the meek of heart:— Blest here; more blest hereafter. ‘Blessed the mourners.’ Earthly goods Are woes, the Master preaches: Embrace thy sad beatitudes And recognize thy riches! XIII And if, of every land the guest, Thine exile back returning Finds still one land unlike the rest Discrowned, disgraced, and mourning, Give thanks! Thy flowers, to yonder skies Transferred pure airs are tasting; And, stone by stone, thy temples rise In regions everlasting. XIV Sleep well, unsung by idle rhymes Ye sufferers late and lowly; Ye saints and seers of earlier times Sleep well in cloisters holy! Above your bed the bramble bends The yew tree and the alder: Sleep well, O fathers, and O friends And in your silence moulder! II. THE MUSIC OF THE FUTURE. I Hark, hark that chime! The frosts are o'er! With song the birds force on the spring: Thus, Ireland, sang thy bards of yore: O younger bards, 'tis time to sing! Your Country's smile that with the past Lay dead so long—that vanished smile— Evoke it from the dark and cast Its light around a tearful isle! II Like severed locks that keep their light When all the stately frame is dust A Nation's songs preserve from blight A Nation's name, their sacred trust. Temple and pyramid eterne May memorize her deeds of power; But only from the songs we learn How throbbed her life-blood hour by hour. III Thrice blest the strain that brings to one Who weeps by some Australian rill A worn out life far off begun His Country's countenance beauteous still! That 'mid Canadian wilds, or where Rich-feathered birds are void of song, Wafts back, 'mid gusts of Irish air Old wood-notes loved and lost so long! IV Well might the Muse at times forsake Her Grecian hill, and sit where swerve In lines like those of Hebé's neck That wood-girt bay, yon meadow's curve, Foynes Island. Watching the primrose clusters throw Their wan light o'er that ivied cave, And airs by myrtles odoured blow The apple blossom on the wave! V Thrice blest the strain that, when the May Allures the young leaf from the bud When robins, thrushlike, shake the spray And deepening purples tinge the flood Kindles new worlds of love and truth, This world's lost Eden, still new-born, In breast of Irish maid or youth Reading beneath the Irish thorn: VI That wins from over-heated strife Blinded ambition's tool; that o'er The fields of unsabbatic life The church-bells of the past can pour, Around the old oak lightning-scarred Can raise the untainted woods that rang When, throned 'mid listening kerns, the bard Of Oisin and of Patrick sang. VII Saturnian years return! Ere long Peace, justice-built, the Isle shall cheer: Even now old sounds of ancient wrong At distance roll, but come not near: Past is the iron age—the storms That lashed the worn cliff, shock on shock; The bird in tempest cradled warms At last her wings upon the rock. VIII How many a bard may lurk even now, Ireland, among thy noble poor! To Truth their genius let them vow, Scorn the bad Syren's tinsel lure; Faithful to illustrate God's word On Nature writ; or re-revealing, Through Nature, Christian lore transferred From faith to sight by songs heart-healing. IX Fair land! the skill was thine of old Upon the illumined scroll to trace In heavenly blazon blue or gold The martyr's palm the angel's face; One day on every Muse's page Be thine a saintly light to fling, And bathe the world's declining age Once more in its baptismal spring! X Man sows: a Hand Divine must reap: The toil wins most that wins not praise: Stones buried in oblivion's deep May help the destined pile to raise, Foundations fix for pier or arch;— Above that spirit-bridge's span To Faith's inviolate home may march, In God's good time, enfranchised man. III. INDUSTRY. I Free children of a land set free A land late bound in fetters Demand ye why your critic guest Scoffs oft in you his betters? Nor race alone nor creed to him Is stumbling-block, or scandal: Your rags offend! he loathes in you Light purse and slipshod sandal. II His Virtue builds on Self-Respect: Upon that clay foundation Nor rock nor sand his trophies stand, The unit, and the nation: Sad martyr of a finite Hope, Nor seeks he, nor attains he The all-heavenly prize. He toils for Earth; But what he seeks that gains he. III Grasp ye, with ampler aim, that good His tragic creed o'erprizes: With loftier Mind revere in him The Will that energizes The strong right hand, the lion heart The industrial truth and valour: When comes reverse he too can die, But not in dirt and squalor. IV Upon your brows the sunrise breaks: Then scorn the dirgeful ditty! Never, be sure, the heart was strong That dallied with self-pity. Your Fathers' part was this—to bear— That plague they bore God stayeth: Be yours to act! To manhood born Be men! ‘Who worketh, prayeth.’ V Son of the sorrowing Isle, her eyes Arraign thee for unkindness! Her shipless seas, her stagnant moors Accuse thy sloth or blindness: Set free her greatness; sing to her New harvests waving round thee, ‘Thy son with golden robe hath girt With golden crown hath crowned thee!’ VI Young maid that bend'st above thy wheel So pure, so meek, so simple, The wool out-drawing as the smile Developes from the dimple Smile on! thou cloth'st thy country's feet Those feet long bare and bleeding! Smile on! thou send'st her Faith abroad With seemlier swiftness speeding! VII Advance, victorious Years! we land On solid shores and stable: Recede, dim seas, and painted cloud Of legend and of fable! The Heroic Age returns. Of old Men fought with spears and arrows: The sea-bank is the shield to-day: The true knight drains and harrows! IV. THE FOUNDATION OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY. 1851. I The Land, how lies she cold and dead When on her brow long since Freedom its virtuous radiance shed And drove the darkness thence? The child at her its stone may fling; The dragon-fly her cheek may sting— ‘Ho! murdered was she, or self-slain This bulk with blackness in the brain?’ II 'Tis past! the Realm has learned its want: The Nation wills its work: Her eastern skies with lustre pant Vacant till now and murk: She vows with heavenly Faith to join The manly mind, the fixed design The mastering knowledge; public heart; The nature crowned not quenched by art. III 'Twas in a dolorous hour, 'twas then When Famine plagued our coast, And Penal Law, The Ecclesiastical Titles Act, 1851. let loose again, Trod feebly like a ghost The land he once had stamped in blood 'Twas then her need we understood: 'Twas then her Genius from a cloud Looked forth and cried to us aloud! IV The People heard; and, far and wide, Like some long clarion blast By town, and plain, and mountain side The inspiring Mandate passed: His children's crust the peasant shared With him that brought the news, and bared A hearth already blank to aid That great emprize so long delayed. V In Glendalough's green vale, and where The skylark shrills o'er Lee Once more her domes shall Wisdom rear And house the brave and free; From Cashel's rock, th' old Minster fane Shall laugh in light o'er Thomond's plain; Grey Arran pierce the sea-fog's gloom; Kildare her vestal lamp relume. VI Where Shannon sweeps by lost Athlone To Limerick's Castle walls New college choirs the river's moan Shall tune at intervals; By kingly Clonmacnoise and Cong Fresh notes shall burst of olden song And by that wave-washed northern shore Whereon they toiled—those ‘Masters Four.’ VII They toiled and toiled till sank the night: They toiled till aching morn Through mist of breakers rose with light Uncertain and forlorn: Their country's Present overcast, They vowed thus much should live—her Past! A beam o'er graves heroic shed And haunt with dreams the Oppressor's bed. VIII Lo! where we stand one day shall spread Cloisters like branching wood: On the great Founder's sculptured head Dr. Newman. Our Irish sunshine brood! I see the fountains gem the grass; Through murmuring courts the red gown pass; Religion's pageant and the vaunt Of Learning mailed and militant. IX I see, entombed in marble state, Roderick—O'More—Red Hugh; The two crowned Mourners Charles I. and James II.—wise too late— Their tardy wisdom rue: I see the Martyrs of old time; The warriors hymned in Irish rhyme, And Burke and Grattan, just in deed Though nurslings of an alien creed. X The vision deepens: tower-cast shades With sunset longer grow:— High ranged round airy colonnades Fronting that western glow, Lean out stone Patrons, veiled all day But vast at eve against the grey Like those great Hopes that o'er us shine Distinctest in our life's decline. XI 'Tis night: the dusk arcades between Glimmers, O Derg, thy Lake! The May moon o'er it trails serene Her silver-woven wake: What songs are those? Each boat has crossed Half-way that radiance—and is lost Returning from each ivied pile That hallows Iniscaltra's Isle. XII The moon is set, and all is dark Yet still those oars keep time: The great clock shakes the courts, and hark, That many-steepled chime! From college on to college roll The peals o'er creek and woody knoll!— My Country, will it! Fancy's store Is rich: yet Faith can grant thee more! V. TO IRELAND—AGAINST FALSE FREEDOM. I. The Nations have their parts assign'd: The deaf one watches for the blind: The blind for him that hears not hears: Harmonious as the heavenly spheres Despite their outward fret and jar Their mutual ministrations are. Some shine on history's earlier page; Some prop the world's declining age: One, one reserves her buried bloom To flower perchance on Winter's tomb. II. Greece, weak of Will but strong in Thought, To Rome her arts and science brought: Rome, strong yet barbarous, gain'd from her A staff, but, like Saint Christopher Knew not for whom his strength to use What yoke to bear, what master choose. His neck the giant bent!—thereon The Babe of Bethlehem sat! Anon That staff his prop, that sacred freight His guide, he waded through the strait And enter'd at a new world's gate. III. On that new stage were played once more The parts in Greece rehearsed before: Round fame's Olympic stadium vast The new-born, emulous Nations raced; Now Spain, now France the headship won Unrisen the Russian Macedon: But naught, O Ireland, like to thee Hath been! A Sphinx-like mystery At the world's feast thou sat'st death-pale; And blood-stains tinged thy sable veil. IV. Apostle, first, of worlds unseen! For ages, then, deject and mean:— Be sure, sad land, a concord lay Between thy darkness and thy day! Thy hand, had temporal gifts been thine, Had lost perchance the things divine. Truth's witness sole! The insurgent North Gave way when falsehood's flood went forth; On the scarr'd coasts deform'd and cleft Thou, like the Church's Rock, wert left! V. That Tudor tyranny which stood 'Mid wrecks of Faith, was quench'd in blood When Charles, its child and victim, lay The Rebel-Prophet's bleeding prey. Once more the destined wheel goes round! Heads royal long are half discrown'd: Ancestral rights decline and die:— Thus Despotism and Anarchy Alternate each the other chase Twin Bacchantes wreathed around one vase. VI. The future sleeps in night: but thou O Island of the branded brow Her flatteries scorn who rear'd by Seine Fraternity's ensanguined reign And for a sceptre twice abhorr'd Twice welcomed the Cesarian sword! Thy past, thy hopes, are thine alone! Though crush'd around thee and o'erthrown, The majesty of civil might The hierarchy of social right Firm state in thee for ever hold! Religion was their life and mould. VII. The vulgar, dog-like eye can see Only the ignobler traits in thee; Quaint follies of a fleeting time; Dark reliques of the Oppressor's crime. The Seer—what sees he? What the West Has ne'er except in thee possess'd; The childlike Faith, the Will like fate, And that Theistic Instinct great New worlds that summons from the abyss ‘The balance to redress of this.’ VIII. Wait thou the end; and spurn the while False Freedom's meretricious smile! Stoop not thy front to anticipate A triumph certain! Watch and wait! The schismatic, by birth akin To Socialist and Jacobin, Will claim, when shift the scales of power His natural place. Be thine that hour With good his evil to requite; To save him in his own despite; And backward scare the brood of night! SONNET. SARSFIELD AND CLARE. Silent they slumber in the unwholesome shade: And why lament them? Virtue too can die: Old wisdom labours in extremity; And greatness stands aghast, and cries for aid Full often: aye, and honour grows dismayed; And all those eagle hopes so pure and high Which soar aloft in youth's unclouded sky Drop dustward, self-subverted, self-betrayed. Call it not joy to walk the immortal floor Of this exulting earth, nor peace to lie Where the thronged marbles awe the passer by: True rest is this; the task, the mission o'er, To bide God's time and man's neglect to bear— Hail, loyal Sarsfield! Hail, high-hearted Clare! TO CHARLES COUNT DE MONTALEMBERT, WITH A COPY OF ‘INISFAIL.’ Your spirit walks in halls of light: On earth you breathe its sunnier climes: How can an Irish muse invite Your fancy thus to sorrowing rhymes? But you have fought the Church's fight! My Country's Cause and hers are one: And every Cause that rests on Right Invokes Religion's bravest son. Scotland reveres her great Montrose, Scotland bewails her brave Dundee! With Alfred's memory England glows:— What lethal hemlock freezes thee My country, that thy trophies rise To noteless men, or men ill-famed, While they thy manlier destinies Who shaped, so long remain unnamed? The Dutchman strides his steed new-gilt In thy chief city's stateliest way; The Kings thy monarchy who built Or died to save it, where are they? Clontarf! That King who smote the Dane That King who raised a realm laid low— On thee what hath he? Benburb's plain No record bears of Owen Roe! Forgotten now as Nial and Conn Are those twin stars of Yellow-Ford Who freed Tyrconnell and Tyrone Their country's altars who restored. Ireland awake! For thine own weal Yield thy great Dead their honours late: Those only understand who feel How self-disfranchised are the ingrate! Sonnets. I. THE IRISH CONSTITUTION OF 1782. Nobles of Ireland! they your work arraign That won your victory! Lightning-like the thrill Of Liberty speeds on! O land, be still! Your patriots toiled, your vales rejoice in vain. ‘Our Nation wears no more the servile stain! Our People turns no more the Conqueror's mill!’ Nation and People have ye none! Your Will Tyrannic knits anew the severed chain! The refusal of Parliamentary Reform, and of Catholic Emancipation, rendered the Irish Constitution of 1782 a nullity. Nobles of Ireland that would fain be free Set free your Irish Helots! From that hour Nation and People equalled shall ye stand With England, side to side, or brand to brand! Boast not till then a Freedom void of Power: A laughing Devil mocks such Liberty! II. CHRISTIAN EDUCATION. What man can check the aspiring life that thrills And glows through all this multitudinous wood; That throbs in each minutest leaf and bud, And, like a mighty wave ascending, fills More high each day with flowers the encircling hills? From earth's maternal heart her ancient blood Mounts to her breast in milk! her breath doth brood O'er fields Spring-flashed round unimprisoned rills! Such life is also in the breast of Man; Such blood is at the heart of every Nation Not to be chained by Statesman's frown or ban. Hope and be strong: fear and be weak! The seed Is sown: be ours the prosperous growth to feed With food, not poison—Christian Education! III. IRELAND AND THE ‘ECCLESIASTICAL TITLES ACT.’ The statesmen of this day I deem a tribe That dwarf-like strut, a pageant on a stage Theirs but in pomp and outward equipage, Ruled inly by the herd or hireling scribe. They have this skill, the Power they dread to bribe: This courage, war upon the weak to wage: To turn from self a Nation's ignorant rage: To unstaunch old wounds with edict or with jibe. Ireland! The unwise one saw thee in the dust Crowned with eclipse, and garmented with night, And in his hear the said, ‘For her no day!’ But thou long since hadst placed in God thy trust, And knew'st that in the under-world, all light, Thy sun moved eastward. Watch! that East grows grey! 1851. SHEPHERD SONG. From spinning at the threshold From knitting at the stile The lover sang, draw nearer, girl, Bring close to me that smile! Let Morrise weed the garden Let Nora milk the cow; I hate to see thee bend and drop The seed behind the plough. Spring calls the wakening lily; The lilac calls the bee; The goldfinch calls his bright-eyed mate; And Love and I call thee. It is that wheel still droning That will not let thee hear Though laughs the gold-weed from the lake, The blossom from the breer. THESE SONNETS ARE DEDICATED TO CHARLES ELIOT NORTON By AUBREY DE VERE IN MEMORY OF OLD ROMAN DAYS I. JOAN OF ARC. O royal-hearted peasant-maid of France Whom that ‘still voice’ which those alone can hear Who walk in innocence and void of fear To war-fields called from rural toils or dance; Whom God's great saints, revealed to thee in trance, For knightly onset girt with shield and spear, Thy task a Christian throne from dust to rear And work a Christian realm's deliverance; O thou that charioted by martyr-fires Rod'st to thy God that task fulfilled, this day A deeper need a saintlier aid requires; Invaders worse possess thy France, their prey; This hour suffice not crown restored, or chrism: Her Foes within: thy prayers are exorcism. 1889. II. THE PRINCE OF WALES' TRIBUTE OF PRAISE TO FATHER DAMIEN. June 1889. 'Twas just! Fanatic strifes expire, self-slain: Nature lives on, and Faith. In years gone by ‘The Mass,’ men clamoured, ‘is Idolatry; The Priest’—true hearts this hour such cries disdain: Men differ still, but kindly differ, fain Like England's Prince to crown with eulogy All those who live for God and man, who die As Damien died—no barren death or vain. Son of old Scottish kings in tartan clad That chased the stag through woods of Calydon, Were crowned at Scone, in Holyrood held sway, Those kings, that martyr-priest in faith were one! They heard thy words in Heaven. She most was glad Thine ancestress who bled at Fotheringay. III. ON THE LATE PILGRIMAGE TO PARAY LE MONIAL. A.D. 1873. I. THE BEATA. She that amid the marbles and the gems Richer than those that flatter king or queen Couches, psalm-circled, 'neath yon tapers' sheen, Despised the light of earthly diadems. Cesarian pomps, by Tyber or by Thames, For her no splendours held. Her vision keen, Piercing earth's glories, found them all unclean On every shore the sea's blue crescent hems. Alone the Will of God to her was fair: Her Universe reflected but His beam: Yet man remains her client. Critic, spare To brand that great life as a barren dream: One gift she gave who claimed in gifts no part— She drew man nearer to his Saviour's Heart. II. SANCTITY. Not for the music of miraculous Deeds Which through God's House resound at intervals Like marriage chimes gladdening far distant meads Or torrents echoing from the mountain walls Not for bright Visions sent from heavenly halls; Not for that blest The Devotion to the Sacred Heart. Devotion—thine—which breeds Daily new helps for Time's advancing needs; 'Tis not for these that grateful man installs Thy memory in his heart. The earth-shaking Word The all-wondrous Act, whole realms to justice won— But shadows are of that, the Unseen, the Unheard, Which they whose Gods are Heroes hate and shun: For that thou art we love thee; that which He His Saints Who fashions, worked, and was, in thee. IV. ST. CHRYSOSTOM'S RETURN FROM EXILE. Arcadius, Emperor of the East, banished St. Chrysostom. He died of his sufferings on his way to his place of exile, Pityus, on the eastern coast of the Euxine. Thirty years later Theodosius II., son of Arcadius, brought back the body of the Saint to Constantinople, and interred it, A.D. 438, in the Church of the Apostles. See Leaves from St. John Chrysostom, by Mary H. Allies, pp. 13—15. Sad is the music though the midnight seas Flash in the torch-light brighter than by day— Dirge for the dead. A hundred ships make way Like pyres of Norland kings, before the breeze. That night they pass the famed Symplegades; At dawn they anchor in Byzantium's bay; At noon, o'er streets flower-strewn with banners gay A regal train advances. Who are these? An Emperor kneels before a Pontiff's bier, Suing the pardon of a Father's crime; A penitent people high the coffin rear; The ‘Apostles' Church,’ as in the ancient time, Receives once more her exiled Chrysostom— Fitlier this day he sleeps Saint Peter's guest at Rome. V. THE DEATH OF POPE HILDEBRAND. ‘Justice I loved: the unrighteous way by me Was hated; for that cause exile I die.’ Thus Hildebrand; his prelates wept hard by Save one, his best and dearest. All night he Had watched that Sufferer while Salerno's sea Beat on the neighbouring coasts. With kindling eye Fixed on the dying man he made reply Risen from the ground yet bending still his knee: ‘Father, not so! All wrongs save one may rage Around God's Church, strike down its earthly Head: A prison may be his home, a rack his bed,— Exile he can not be for God hath sworn “The heathen I will make thy heritage And thy possession earth's remotest bourn.”’ VI. THE FORMULARY OF POPE HORMISDAS. See The Holy See and the Wanderings of the Nations, p. 167, by Thomas W. Allies, K.C.S.G. January 18, 1889. ‘The Chalice Jesus raised, the Bread He brake, Emperor, and ye his bishops of the East Who share the Empire's, not the Church's feast, At Peter's board demand not to partake Until not less those Words which Jesus spake, “Peter thou art: upon this Rock I build My Church”—Creative Words in act fulfilled— Ye take into your hearts for Jesus' sake.’ Thus wrote Hormisdas. Onward as a wind That Spirit Divine Who o'er the waters moved Wafted his legates saintly and approved: Two thousand and five hundred bishops signed The Pontiff's ‘Rule’ Regula Fidei. in Christ's own words confessed: Died the revolt. That hour God's Church found rest. VII. THE SPANISH ARMADA AND THE ENGLISH CATHOLICS. A Spanish fleet affront our English shores! It must not be; it shall not! Sink or swim Our Cause, our lamp of Hope burn bright or dim, Long as o'er English cliffs the osprey soars, Long as on English coasts the breaker roars, No alien flag shall scale our blue sea-rim, No smoke from Spanish gun our skies bedim, No foot from Parma stain our household floors! Fair sirs, we question not your true intent To prop true Faith, and Queens in wedlock born: But foreign aid, and arms, and arts we scorn: To native hearts and hands we trust the event: The Right is ours; with God the arbitrament: At worst, beyond His night remains His morn! VIII. THE ISLAND OF IONA. Columba, though a priest, had joined in an Irish battle. The penance imposed on him was perpetual exile from Ireland. He made Iona his abode till death, preaching on the adjacent shores. Montalembert affirms that later his Irish monks converted nearly three-quarters of Anglo-Saxon England. Not for the tombs of old Norwegian Kings Or Scottish, iron-mailed, and crowned at Scone: Not for those ‘Island-Lords’ The ‘Lords of the Isles.’ the Minstrel sings As sang his sires in centuries past and flown; Not for yon grassy terrace breeze-o'erblown, Yon crags to which the storm-wrecked shepherd clings Eying far lights on isle and mountain thrown As though from onward-sailing Angels' wings;— Iona! 'Tis not these that yearly draw Thy Pilgrims hither o'er the Northern sea And hold them there spell-bound in loving awe: That spell, Columba, is the thought of thee! They gaze; they muse; ‘these shores that Exile trod— That Exile's sons gave England to her God!’ IX. MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS. See Mr. Hosack's unanswered vindication of Mary. Strong Land, by Wallace trod and Bruce: brave Land That broke great Edward's ranks at Bannockburn: Fair Land whose breast, upheaved in Faith's bright morn Breathed forth, like sighs of joy, these fanes that stand Even now on Stirling's rock, Iona's strand; How long shall Justice point with sorrowing scorn At that sole act which on thy brow time-worn So long unblemished, stamped so dark a brand? A Queen there was, struck down in beauty's prime, Captive till death, religious, fearless, true: The calumny that dogged her was a crime Of edge more trenchant than the axe that slew. False nobles wrecked her, and a Rival's hate— Repent that wrong thy tears alone can expiate! X. A PORTRAIT OF ANNE BOLEYN. Ah, silver-tissued phantom lithe as hind Skimming dark glades! Ah, white as moon that dips In storm-cloud black its crescent's glimmering tips! Ah, blithesome foot, swifter than wave or wind! Were those the mocking eyes whose fiat signed Honour's death-warrant? Those the laughing lips That o'er a realm's Religion breathed eclipse; A King, once kingly, changed to false and blind? Salomè new! was this the babe that played With her own shadow 'mid the founts and flowers? Death-sentenced Queen! was this the girl that prayed Before our Lady's shrine, unmoved for hours? I judge not her. The night before her death She prayed her childhood's prayers—with tranquil breath. XI. ON THE CONSECRATION OF ST. PATRICK'S NEW CATHEDRAL AT ARMAGH. August 24, 1873. This day the crime of ages stands reversed: This day, re-risen, in saintlier sovereignty Saint Patrick's towers invoke their native sky, His second Temple lordlier than his first: Orient once more, a vanished Hope hath burst From night's black realm: in Stygian pageantry The stormy wrecks of Penal years go by Like ghosts remanded to their realms accurst. Ho, Watcher on the summits! cry aloud, How speeds the dawn? What promise gilds the East? A Voice responds—thy voice, great Patriarch-Priest, ‘I see a Race baptized as in the cloud: I see a Nation round an Altar bowed: I see God's People share His Marriage Feast.’ XII. ON THE CONSECRATION OF IRELAND TO THE SACRED HEART. Passion Sunday 1873. Lift up Thy gates, triumphant Heart Eterne Heart of the God-man! Heart that, throned on high, Larger than that starred palace of the sky In glory reignest, and in love dost burn! To Thee this day a People's heart doth yearn; To Thee, all eagle-winged, yet tremblingly Makes way; in Thee would live; for Thee would die, Zealous for Thee terrestrial crowns to spurn. ‘Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates,’ And give a nation leave to enter in! The centuries ended of her adverse fates This day with God she hides her from the sin Of prosperous realms that trample gifts divine— Heart of the God-man, make Thy captive Thine! ON THE LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE NEW CHURCH AT MAYNOOTH COLLEGE. XIII. THE PAST. October 10, 1875. Not vain the faith and patience of the Saints! Not vain, sad Isle, thy many-centuried woes! Thy day was tempest-cradled; but its close Is splendour; and the shattered forest's plaints In music die. No dull repining taints That ether pure of memory's realm, which far Recedes, like some long tract left waste by war, Some tract which eve with peaceful purple paints. Long time thy priests, my country, were thy poor: The Cross their book they raised the Sacrifice In ruined chancel, and on rainy moor: Behold, the great reward is come! Arise, Fane long desired! Beneath thy roofs of gold Throne the new rites—the creed and worship old! XIV. THE FOUNDATION STONE. Descend, strong Stone, into my country's breast: Child of the sea-beat cliff, or skiey height, Descend, well-pleased, into the eternal night; Amid the eternal silence make thy rest! Descend in hope, thou high, prophetic Guest, For God a covenant upon thee doth write: On thee His pledge is graved in words of might Plain as those mandates by His hand impressed, While Sinai's peaks made answer, thunder-riven, On the twinned Tablets of the Hebrew Law. This day the future with the past is wed; The undying promise with the greatness dead; Ireland this day her ancient pact with Heaven Renews in godly triumph, loving awe. XV. THE MAYNOOTH CENTENARY;OR, IRELAND'S VOCATION. I heard a voice and turned me. From above A heavenly City crowned with minsters fair And college courts high-towered, through glittering air Drew to our planet softly as a dove; Nearer that vision moved or seemed to move: At last it reached our shores; and I was 'ware That all its walls were graved with text and prayer Truth's legend old, God's book of endless Love. Anon from all its gates there issued forth Prophet-processions singing this: ‘This day Our task again reaches the ends of Earth! Ireland gave mandate, and her sons obey, Ireland, the Apostolic Land. Four-fold Faith's victories new shall pass her victories old!’ 1895. XVI. THE NEW CATHOLIC CHURCH NEAR WINDERMERE. 1885. I Deep-bosomed vales of England's queenliest land, And thou her amplest as her loveliest lake, Be just, be grateful, and our joy partake! Lo where a daughter of that Faith once banned Takes 'mid your bosky slopes, once more her stand! Through yonder cloud I see a promise break; ‘The land that slept, that land at last shall wake And hail yon Cross there raised at God's command,’ From Langdale's pikes to Scawfell's loneliest wold Rejoice fair hills whose yew-woods teemed of old The bows at Crecy feared and Ascalon; Rejoice thou most, grey Furness, early and late Warding our British Highlands' southern gate: Say to thy graves; ‘Rejoice! the night is gone!’ II Wordsworth, and Southey, and that other Name Coleridge. Fitly with these conjoined, whose Orphic lays Though few, gave help to tune discordant days, Whose insight puts our modern seers to shame, When to this Carmel of the North ye came Then young, no prophet race survived to raise Truth's standard old; perforce in Error's maze Ye walked, though pure your feet and high your aim. Not less Truth's whisper, from Iona's Isle First breathed, still faintly clung to cliff and fell Like night-dews trembling round some ruined pile! That whisper to a trumpet's blast shall swell, And ye, great Souls with Fisher and with More Exulting hear it from the eternal shore. III Great men grow rarer daily; great were these: Greater those tonsured Saints discalced, who trod, Now living Powers, not plaintive Memories, This God-loved land, and rest this day with God: Herbert who paced blue Derwent's flower-girt flood; Cuthbert, his friend, whose sea-girt diocese From Lindisfarne to westward-throned St. Bees Revered one crosier staff and prophet-rod; Old Bede, and countless more in Faith's glad morn Who roamed Northumbria's bound, and glorified Bernicia and Deira and Strathclyde: Behold! to them this day a child is born! This day to God they lift their hands and say, ‘Bless this new Altar: bless Thy Land for aye.’ XVII. WALNA CRAG, AND ‘THE LADY'S RAKE,’ DERWENTWATER. 1895. Not Skiddaw, not Blencathara's ‘skiey height,’ Not Derwent Isle, Lodare, not Borrodale, So charmed in youth, so cheer in age my sight As thou, O Walna Crag, and that sad tale Of her who, rebel-roused at dead of night, Caught up her Babe new-born; still weak and frail Clasping that Babe found strength yon cliff to scale While fought far off her Lord to attest a right By sophists mocked. King James' fall was just: He sinned; but blameless was King James' son; His claim was owned by James' ill-crowned daughter: Who charged with crime that Royal Youth? Not one! Who died to vindicate that claim august? That peerless Lady's Consort—Derwentwater. XVIII. ULSWATER. September 5, 1895. Pensive Ulswater, thanks! Thy face once more I see. Hail, English Lakeland's duskiest Child, Duskiest, for, closeliest here around thee piled Her mountains fling their shades from shore to shore. Again thine Aira Force's ‘gentle roar’ I hear breeze-borne o'er heathery waste and wild; Again I see, delightedly beguiled, Those daffodils thy Wordsworth sang of yore. See Wordsworth's lines, ‘I wandered lonely as a cloud,’ etc. The waves beside them ‘they out-did in glee’ That day. This hour perchance from yonder sky Their Poet sees them—she beside him, she Wordsworth's sister. Who gazed with him through tears on Yarrow's bowers— Ah surely nothing bright and fair once ours, If wholly pure, can ever wholly die! URBS ROMA DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF CHARLES COUNT DE MONTALEMBERT. I. ST. PETER'S BY MOONLIGHT. Low hung the moon when first I stood in Rome: Midway she seemed attracted from her sphere On those twin Fountains shining broad and clear Whose floods not mindless of their mountain home Rise there in clouds of rainbow mist and foam. That hour fulfilled the dream of many a year: Through that thin veil with joy akin to fear The steps I saw, the pillars, last the dome. A spiritual Empire there embodied stood: The Roman Church there met me face to face: Ages sealed up of evil and of good Slept in that circling colonnade's embrace. Alone I stood, a stranger and alone, Changed by that stony miracle to stone. II. PONTIFIC MASS IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL. Forth from their latticed and mysterious cells The harmonies are spreading, onward rolled: Ere long, by counter tides met and controlled, Midway more high the gathering tumult swells; It sinks: a breeze the incense cloud dispels: Once more Sibylline forms, and Prophets stoled Look down, supreme of Art's high miracles, Upon the Church terrene. Once more, behold, With what an awful majesty of mien The Kingly Priest, his holy precincts rounding, Tramples the marbles of the sacred scene: The altar now he nears, and now the throne; As though the Law were folded in his zone And all the Prophets in his skirts were sounding. III. THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN. Degrading Art's augustest minist'rings Yon Pillar soars with sculptured forms embost Whose grace at that ambitious height is lost: Lo! as the stony serpent twines its rings Priests, coursers, heralds, warriors, slaves, and kings Mingle, a tortuous mass confused and crost; While Art, least honoured here where flattered most, Deplores in vain her prostituted springs By a fallen Angel at their source ill-stirred; Unholy—thence unhealing! What is aid Vouchsafed upon conditions that degrade To one who her allegiance hath transferred? O Attic Art brought low, that here dost stand Full-fed, but hooded, on a tyrant's hand! IV. THE ARCH OF TITUS. I stood beneath the Arch of Titus long; On Hebrew forms there sculptured long I pored; Till fancy, by a distant clarion stung Woke: and methought there moved that arch toward A Roman Triumph. Lance and helm and sword Glittered; white coursers tramped and trumpets rung: Last came, car-borne a captive horde among The laurelled Boast of Rome—her destined Lord. As though by wings of unseen eagles fanned The Conqueror's cheek when first that Arch he saw Burned with the flush he strove in vain to quell— Titus! a loftier arch than thine hath spanned Rome and the world with empery and law; Thereof each stone was hewn from Israel! V. THE CAMPAGNA SEEN FROM ST. JOHN LATERAN. Was it the trampling of triumphant hosts That levelled thus yon plain, sea-like and hoary; Armies from Rome sent forth to distant coasts And back returning clad with spoils of glory? Around it loom cape, ridge, and promontory: Above it sunset shadows fleet like ghosts, Fast-borne o'er keep and tomb whose ancient boasts By Time confuted, name have none in story. Fit seat for Rome! for here is ample space Which greatness chiefly needs—severed alone By yonder aqueducts with queenly grace That sweep in curves concentric ever on Bridging a world subjected as a chart To that great City, head of earth and heart. VI. BIRDS IN THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN. Egerian warbler! unseen rhapsodist! Whose carols antedate the Roman spring; Who, while the old grey walls, thy playmates, ring, Dost evermore on one deep strain insist, Flinging thy bell-notes through the sunset mist! Around thy haunt rich weeds and wall-flowers swing As in a breeze, the twilight crimsoning That sucks from them aërial amethyst— O for a Sibyl's insight to reveal That lore thou sing'st of! Shall I guess it? nay! Enough to hear thy strain: enough to feel O'er all the extended soul the freshness steal Of those ambrosial honeydews that weigh Down with sweet force the azure lids of day. VII. THE ‘MISERERE’ IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL. From sadness on to sadness, woe to woe, Searching all depths of grief ineffable, Those sighs of the Forsaken sink and swell And to a piercing shrillness gathering, grow. Now one by one, commingling now, they flow: Now in the dark they die, a piteous knell, Lorn as the wail of exiled Israel Or Hagar weeping o'er her outcast. No— Never hath loss external forced such sighs! O ye with secret sins that inly bleed And drift from God, search out if ye are wise Your unrepented infelicities: And pray, whate'er the punishment decreed, It prove not exile from your Maker's eyes! VIII. THE ‘MISERERE’ IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL. Those sounds expiring on mine ear, mine eye Was by their visual reflex strangely spelled: A vision of the Angels who rebelled Still hung before me, through the yielding sky Sinking on plumes outstretched imploringly: Their Tempter's hopes and theirs for ever quelled They sank with hands upon their eyes close held And longed, methought, for death yet could not die. Down, ever down a mournful pageant streaming Like Souls in whom Despair hath slain Endeavour Inwoven choirs to ruin blindly tending, They sank. I wept as one who weeps while dreaming To see them, host on host, by doom descending Down the dim gulfs, for ever and for ever. IX. THE MONUMENTS OF QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN AND THE COUNTESS MATILDA IN ST. PETER'S. Lo, here, the crownless Queen of royal heart; The Christian Queen that, vowed to Christ, laid down The infected sceptre and the apostate crown, Zealous with that dear Lord to bear her part Whom the blind North was ‘adverse to desert.’ To her what thing was Fortune's smile or frown, Fortune that stoles the knave, and thrones the clown Whose Church the palace is, whose Realm the mart? Christina, and Matilda! Here they lie! One spurned a kingdom: dying, one endowed The meek one with the trappings of the proud And fixed her realm, a glittering gem, on high Star of that temporal crown by Peter worn— Sleep well, brave sisters, till the eternal morn! X. THE CATACOMBS. Whoever seeks for penitential days And vows that fitly on such days attend A region apt, his wanderings here may end: These caverns, winding in sepulchral maze Are stronger than the desert's loneliest ways Thoughts meek and sad with lofty thoughts to blend:— Descend, great Pontiff! Sovran Priest, descend! Let all the Princes of the Church upraise With annual rites their sceptres here to God! Kings of the nations, purpling those strange glooms With robes imperial on your faces sink Sink, and be saved, in those dread catacombs! And deeply of the inspiring incense drink That rises from the dust the Martyrs trod! XI. THE APPIAN WAY. Awe-struck I gazed upon that rock-paved way, The Appian Road; marmorean witness still To Rome's resistless stride and fateful Will, Which mocked at limits, opening out for aye Divergent paths to one imperial sway— The Nations verily their parts fulfil; And War must plough the fields which Law shall till; Therefore Rome triumphed till the appointed day. Then from the Catacombs, like waves up-burst The Host of God, and scaled as in an hour O'er all the earth the mountain seats of Power. Gladly in that baptismal flood immersed The old Empire died to live. Once more on high It sits; now clothed with immortality. XII. ON THE CROSS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COLISEUM. Far from his friends, his country, and his home, Perhaps on that small spot—ay doubtless there— Some Christian Martyr fell, in one wide stare Concentrating the myriad gaze of Rome. Now central stands beneath heaven's mighty dome The Cross which marks that spot! Stranger, beware! The Orb of Earth was framed that Cross to bear: And when, slow-tottering round an Empire's tomb These walls, within whose grey encincture vast That Cross for ages stands as in a shrine, Around their awful guest shall melt at last, Each stone descending to the earth shall say ‘Empires and Nations crumble: but that Sign Pre-eminent shall stand, and stand for aye!’ XIII. THE FOUNTAIN OF EGERIA. For this cold fount the Sabine Saint and Sage Wooed by high thought forsook both camp and throne: Here on his country's weal he mused alone Calm-visaged as the planetary page: That murmuring spring had power his cares to assuage: Here—dim elsewhere as noontide moon fleece-strewn— In this religious gloom distinctly shewn, Egeria shared his kingly hermitage. O pure as Arethusa, and more high! Cleaving rough seas she spurned the irreverent love; Thine, Roman Nymph, a tenderer sanctity, Bending like air that strong white head above To breathe just counsel in a monarch's ear— Those kings alone are blest to whom thy voice is dear! XIV. THE GRAVES OF TIRCONNEL AND TYRONE ON SAN PIETRO, IN MONTORIO. Within Saint Peter's fane, that kindly hearth Where exiles crowned their earthly loads down cast, The Scottish Kings repose, their wanderings past In death more royal thrice than in their birth. Near them, within a church of narrower girth But, like it, with dilated memories vast, Sad Ulster's Princes find their rest at last Their home the holiest spot, save one, on earth. This is that Mount which saw Saint Peter die! Where stands yon dome stood once that Cross reversed: On this dread Hill, a Western Calvary, The Empire and that Synagogue accurst Clashed two ensanguined hands—like Cain—in one. Sleep where the Apostle slept, Tirconnel and Tyrone! XV. TO THE PILLAR THAT STANDS BESIDE THE HIGH ALTAR AT ‘ST. PAUL'S OUTSIDE THE WALLS,’ ROME. This pillar was destined by the first Napoleon for the decoration of the triumphal arch at Milan, the intended monument of his Italian victories. His fall frustrated the design. Many years later, Wordsworth, while descending into Italy by the Simplon Pass, came upon the unfinished mass as it lay half raised from the Alpine quarry, and addressed to it his sublime sonnet beginning:‘Ambition, following down the far-famed slope,’ and proceeding: ‘Rest where thy course was stayed by power Divine.’ A Conqueror called thee from the eternal night And said, ‘Ascend from thy dark mother's breast; Sustain my glory on thy sunlike crest And by mine altar watch—mine acolyte.’ A Poet, wandering from Helvellyn's height, Beheld thee dead ere born. That Alpine guest Adjured thee, ‘Where thou liest, for ever rest, And freeze those hearts that trust in mortal might.’ The years went by; then, clear above that cloud Which blinds the nations from her Roman throne Thus spake the Universal Church aloud: ‘Arise at last, thou long-expectant stone! For God predestined, consummate thy vow: Advance; and where the Apostle stood stand thou!’ SAINT PETER'S CHAINS; OR, ROME AND THE ITALIAN REVOLUTION. TO THE GREAT MEMORY OF POPE PIUS THE NINTH. June 1, 1897. PART I. The Revolt against Christian Civilization. I. CHRISTMAS EVE, 1859. This night, O Earth, a Saviour germinate! Drop down, ye Heavens, your sweetness from above! This night is closed the iron book of Fate; Open'd this night the book of endless Love. On from the Orient like a breeze doth move The joy world-wide—a breeze that wafts a freight Of vernal song o'er lands benumbed so late, Rivers ice-bound and winter-wasted grove. Onward from Bethlehem, westward o'er the Ægean Travels like night the starry Feast Divine; All realms rejoice; but loudest swells the pæan From that white Basilic on the Esquiline Beneath whose roof in sunlike radiance clad The suffering Pontiff stands—to-night not sad. II. ITALIAN ‘UNIFICATION’ IN 1860. The land which Improvisatores throng With one light bound would freedom improvise, Freedom by England dragged from raging seas Through centuries of battling right and wrong: The gamesters crowned, their loaded dice down flung, Divide their gains; Napoleon got Nice and Savoy; Victor Emanuel, the Northern Papal States and Lombardy. It was a ‘Ten Years' War,’ before ‘Troy fell.’ while—shamelessly at ease— Gold-spangled Fortune, tinselled to the knees, Runs on the tight-rope of the State new-strung! O Liberty, stern goddess, sad and grave, To whom are dear the hearts that watch and wait, The hand laborious strenuous as the glaive, The strong, staid head, the soul supreme o'er fate, With what slow scorn thou turn'st incensed of mien From mimic Freedom's operatic scene! III. GREAT CONNIVING POWERS. The kingdom-selling king puts forth a hand Vile from Church-plunder, leprous to the bone, To rend a second spoil Ancona, etc. The French Emperor had solemnly guaranteed the remaining Papal territory against invasion. from Peter's throne: Silent, yet false, a proud yet servile band, Europe's ‘Great Powers,’ each from its distant strand Applaud the dragon teeth thus deftly sown, Nor heed how France in treason's undertone Whispers, ‘Rome next! Wait, win—and understand.’ ‘Great Powers!’ blind Powers, because they fear to see! Old realms that seal an upstart's new decree! Think ye this traffic means for you no loss? Christ's Vicar bound, what king thenceforth is free? Death-doom of Europe's peace and liberty Is that your state-clerks smilingly engross! IV. THE RETRIBUTION. Statesmen, beware! The Spiritual Power displaced The Moral Power descends. Where then are ye? The eyeless Anarch of the years to be Draws near your feast; will meet you soon full-faced; With cap blood-red his low, base brows are graced: His name we know—‘The Crowned Democracy:’ Wild appetite and reckless pride is he; He scorns all laws on rights prescriptive based. He comes: what stands? God's Word that never errs Replies, ‘The Church: of death she shall not taste:’ If stands the Church, were it not better, Sirs, That girt by Nations just and sage she stood Than like one fortress 'mid a boundless waste, One sad, sole watch-tower by a shipless flood? V. JUVENILE PATRIOTISM. ‘Great Rome our Capitol! Great Rome restored!’ These cries are watchwords, warring each on each; Two forms confused of unhistoric speech: Rome never reigned, a single nation's lord: Rome was at first not State, but bandit horde; A State came next. O'er Carthage' yawning breach Rome dashed through flame while still beyond her reach Italian States the upstart's name abhorred. Later, Rome's Empire rose: a subject earth A world, not Nation, owned its sovereign sway: It fell: at last Time's mystery came to birth: Rome was the Church's seat; man's hope, his stay. Great Rome made pigmy, Rome one nation's head, Means this—‘The old Rome—the Christian—both are dead.’ VI. THE ORIGIN OF THE TEMPORAL POWER. For centuries rose the cry from vale and plain From cities sacked and homesteads black with fire, ‘Where reigned an Empire ruin now doth reign: Our Emperor sought Byzantium: we expire: The Lombard wrecks the north: pitiless in ire The Goth devours the south. Fiercer than Cain The Vandals with the blood of brethren stain Altar and hearth. Great Pontiff, Roman Sire! Christ's chief of shepherds for the souls of men To thee we turn remembering days long since When camped the Hun beneath the Roman wall— That day Pope Leo saved us. Save, as then, That little remnant left! On thee we call: Thy sons would be thy subjects: be our Prince!’ VII. THE OLD AND NEW BARBARIANS. When Rome had fallen and now half-ruinous lay Barbaric kings from many a distant coast Alone, unarmed, meekest when mighty most, Trod her deserted courts and wept, men say: None raised therein his seat of sovereign sway: Dumb through the wreck they glided like a ghost: They felt the Past! Who make that Past their boast This hour feel nothing, braggarts of the day. These mimic statesmen stand confuted thus: ‘Rome ruled the earth through Greatness: that was meet; Your trust is Gallic Fraud and “Plébiscite”: Great Rome, metropolis of that world of old Reduced to crown one new-raised state o'er-bold Would make its impotence but ridiculous.’ VIII. TO ITALY, 1861. All-radiant region! would that thou wert free! Free 'mid thine Alpine realm of cloud and pine Free 'mid the rich vales of thine Apennine Free to the Adrian and the Tyrrhene Sea! God with a twofold freedom franchise thee! Freedom from alien bonds, so often thine, Freedom from Gentile hopes—death-fires that shine O'er the foul grave of Pagan liberty With Pagan empire side by side interred; Then round the fixed throne of their Roman Sire Thy sister States should hang, a Pleiad choir With saintly beam unblunted and unblurred, A splendour to the Christian splendour clinging, A lyre star-strung ever the ‘new song’ singing! IX. THE ITALY OF OLD. Naples and Florence, Parma, Lucca—these Survived, the last of countless states that bore Their starry crowns in history's heaven of yore, Amalfi imaged in her subject seas, Pisa with laurel fresher for the breeze That waved the pinewoods shadowing her shore, Sienna famed in arts Genoa in war, Milan still proud of antique liturgies. Great land! thy patriots old these marvels prized, Each with its palace-keep and minster vast: Not fusion, but a realm confederate They hoped, they claimed; now first a vulgarer fate Tramples that claim. Dissevered from their past They stand—in Freedom's name provincialized. X. THE INVASION OF THE PAPAL STATES. Sept. 1860. O Italy! the guilt but half is thine! Thy sons they are not; foes they are, not friends, These ill-crown'd kings that brim for ill-mask'd ends Freedom's pure cup with blasphemy's false wine. Thou of the hermit's cell, the martyr's shrine! Thou, dew'd with beauty and the Aonian dream Like Greece, but higher placed in God's great scheme, His second Salem's second Palestine!— The malison of Freedom evermore Cleave to his name who burst the eternal band That with Religion links her, hand in hand, And hurl'd the child against the sire in war. Religion spurn'd, there freedom hath no place:— Freedom the pillar is: Virtue its base! XI. ROSSI. Romans—in name—to Liberty, your god Who lift red hands, suppliants self-deified, Betwixt her altar and your rock of pride A stream there rolls fiercer than Alpine flood, A fatal stream of murdered Rossi's blood! For Liberty he lived; and when he died, Prisoner that new Rienzi's corse beside The King, the Father, and the Pontiff stood! What rite piacular from that impious deed Hath cleansed your hands? Accuse not adverse stars If guilt unwept achieve not virture's meed. Years staunch not treason. All his sands old Time Shakes down to keep unblurred those characters Which calendar the Feasts of prosperous crime. XII. TRUE AND FALSE LOVE OF FREEDOM. They that for Freedom feel not love but lust, Irreverent, knowing not her spiritual claim, And they the votaries blind of windy fame, And they who cry, ‘I will because I must,’ They, too, that launch, false to a freeman's trust, A bandit's shaft revenge or greed their aim, And they that make her sacred cause their game From restlessness or spleen or sheer disgust At duteous days—all these, the brood of night, Diverse by one black note detected stand, Their scorn of every barrier raised by right To awe self-will. Howe'er by virtue banned By wisdom spurned, that act the moment needs Licensed they deem; holy whate'er succeeds. XIII. THE APPROACHING DEED. The streets lie silent in the shadows deep Of obelisk and statue o'er them thrown; The foe advances, but the people sleep; No sound save yon cicala's lazy drone: Sunshine intense each glittering dome doth steep, Each Lombard tower, each convent court grass-grown, Flames on the arch, and heats each column prone While feebler grows each fountain's drowsy leap. Methinks such stillness reigned that hour in Rome Three centuries since, when through the fiery air Rose, heard alone, the saintly Pontiff's prayer; Rose, and a slumbering world escaped its doom: The Crescent sank 'neath red Lepanto's shore:— Woe to the world when Saints are heard no more! XIV. THE CONSUMMATION. 20th of September, 1870. The bolt hath fallen! The Abominable that sate By that sad prophet, Daniel, long foretold Within God's Holy City throned of old, The ‘Abominable that maketh desolate,’ Within a holier city now keeps state: One power alone the All-Just to him denies; He dares not quench the Daily Sacrifice: Death-pale he sits prescient of coming fate. Is it my crime, pale river, if no tears Dropt from these eyes thy placid breast have stained Freedom and Faith thus impiously profaned? Not so! The hour is man's: with God the years: Once more His Church will shame her children's fears; True Freedom wax when Freedom's wraith hath waned. PART II. XV. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL APOSTASY. Trampling a dark hill a red sun athwart I saw a host that rent their clothes and hair And dashed their spread hands 'gainst the sunset glare And cried, ‘Go from us, God, since God Thou art! Utterly from our coasts and streets depart, Court, camp, and senate hall, and mountain bare; Our pomp Thou troublest, and our feast dost scare, And with Thy temples dost confuse our mart! Depart Thou from our hearing and our seeing: Depart Thou from the works and ways of men Their laws, their thoughts, the inmost of their being: Black nightmare, hence, that earth may breathe again!’ ‘Can God depart?’ I asked. A voice replied, Close by, ‘Not so; each Sin at heart is Deicide.’ XVI. A RUINED FRENCH ABBEY. At St. Omer. In thee the Daily Sacrifice hath ceased— Twain Avarchs, shades far cast from Antichrist, Revolt, and blasphemy, Sin's king and priest, Here slew the Just and for His raiment diced: Here Revolution, ruin-beneficed Sharpened with rapine's file her dagger's edge: She sold the spoil who wrought the sacrilege: False Freedom spake it; and her word sufficed. O France, long dear to God, once saintly nation, Land of Saint Louis and the Fleur de Lys Must Italy partake thy desolation Partaking thy transgression? Say, must she The grace and glory of God's New Creation, Make end like yonder skeleton tower and thee? XVII. THE LAWLESS RACE. The Scriptures of the Unjust thus prophesy: ‘The Gentiles we! your Christian Good is Ill: We, faithless styled, to Babel faithful still, Build as she built and laws save hers defy: No difference we concede 'twixt Truth and Lie Save what the nations fashion. Each at will Some Faith should license; fools dissentient kill: Best creed is ‘Unbelief, in Unity.’ But what is written? ‘This shall be the lot Of all who war, Jerusalem, on thee: Within their mouth the tongue dried up shall rot; The eye drop out, that eye which would not see; And, shivering as they stand, from off their bones Their flesh shall melt and rot upon the stones.’ Zacharias xiv. 12. XVIII. Remember, Italy, thy judged Compeer France that before thee trod the ways unblest: Long since she made her Revolution: rest She makes not yet, from anguished year to year Circling through wreck to ruin yet more drear. ‘Make them a wheel!’ Thus prayed, by rebels pressed, The Prophet-King: how oft, a bitter jest, That warning haunts the thoughtful patriot's ear! O Italy, discern 'twixt grain and chaff! For Freedom's sake the enchanter's cup fling down: Spurn the base brood that tempt but to betray! On whom, deceived ones, wage ye war this day? On that sole King who held his sceptre-staff Freedom to fence; for man's sake wore his crown. XIX. THE CHURCH OF THE MADELEINE AT PARIS AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. O that the people of this guilty land Might estimate themselves and it aright! Accept yon Temple's sternly kind command Her warning vainly whispered day and night: To lift their glory to a loftier height A people raised this creature of their hand:— Teach them, huge pile, with all thy pillared might, Humility! Do thou their boast withstand! Bid them, in sight of angels and of men Brow-bent and round thee kneeling, to confess That sin whose serpent offspring, not yet dead, Creeps round the earth and stings it! Bid them shed Such tears as fell in the waste wilderness On thy worn bosom, penitent Magdalen! XX. THE STATUE OF VOLTAIRE,ERECTED IN PARIS DURING THE GERMAN INVASION OF 1870. What Shape ascends o'er yonder Stygian sea Of upturned faces—Shape far-off descried With myriad-wrinkled brow, and serpent-eyed? That city which adores him, who is she? Fitly the hour is chosen! Fatefully Advance the armies sent to plague the pride That built its tower on sand and God defied! High Priest of Unbelief and Anarchy Ris'st thou to see thy work? the doom to hear Of nations, Christian once, that spurn their trust? Hark to that gun! More near it sounds, and near— Land of brave hearts! ere yet descends that woe Which comes to save not slay, thy Tempter know! Dash back that idol to its native dust! XXI. THE FRANCE OF A FUTURE TIME. Laugh, thou that weep'st; or with thy weeping blend The glory of that joy which mocks at pain: Vain was thy pride; thy penance is not vain: That woe was the beginning, not the end: Beyond that rain of fire I see descend Armies of God t'ward yon ensanguined plain; And these the Cross and those the Crown sustain:— Elect of Penitents, thy forehead bend; Meet thou that crown in hope that springs from love! Once more true greatness greets thee from above: At last, while far away the tempests rave, Forth from the ashes of thy Pagan boast Leaps thy new life! 'Mid yon celestial host Thy Clotilde triumphs, and thy Genevieve. XXII. THE NEW GERMAN PERSECUTION. Revolted province of the Church of God, But yesterday an Empire made! Too long Thou lift'st the froward foot and clamorous tongue Unweeting of the retributive rod: Her singers once—her saints—thy pastures trod: Still rise her minster towers thy streets among: Her crumbling abbeys still denounce their wrong: Hers every flower that gems the sacred sod! This day thy Teachers world-renowned impeach With deepening spleen the Scriptures as the Pope: Learn from thy second fall! refrain thy speech: With humbleness alone is stored thy hope: Judge thou thyself; staunch first thy wound at home: Rome's prodigal is not the judge of Rome. XXIII. Fair Land! A question I would ask of thee: A time there was when, wanderers wild and rude, Thy children clave the river, pierced the wood Heart-strong yet blind, nor wise, nor just, nor free:— What changed to Realms that raging Anarchy? What Power was that which tamed the barbarous brood, Evoked its thought; its wayward will subdued; Its warring kingdoms crowned with unity? The Faith—the Church! What progress had been thine That Church disowned? Thy Nations where this day Shorn of that Faith's surviving discipline? Thy Prophet's teaching where? Thy Poet's lay? That Church was Italy's selectest dower— Are those her friends who mock its Head this hour? XXIV. THE FAITHFUL FEW. Not vain that ten years' agony! Thus much It proved: whate'er were states and courts, whate'er Statesmen sense-blind might swear and then unswear, In Europe's heart survived great Nature's touch: From farthest lands there flocked who scorned to clutch Fruit of false peace: they rushed to do and dare Or die. Of such was Lamoricière, Charette, O'Reilly, Pimodan; of such Kanzler, who, when the Roman wall in rolled, Stood in the breach. Knights of the Faith, 'tis well! Your place is with those Genoese of old Who, sole of Europe, when Byzantium fell Fought for the Cross. Ye saved mankind one shame: Mentana guards your dead; the Church your fame. XXV. MONTALEMBERT AND DE MÉRODE. Montalembert! De Mérode! Linked were ye In bonds more strong than those of human love, Twins of one Faith and gendered from above— One fruitful Truth, ‘God's City must be free,’ ‘That Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.’—Gal. iv. 26. Prime Truth of Christianized Civility: For that one Truth in word and work ye strove; Nor strove in vain, as years to come shall prove When those who shape their ‘Throned Democracy,’ That Matter-God the foe of cot and crown, Hard hunted by the creature of their hands, Flee from his face amazed o'er seas and lands. The praise of such ye spurned, nor feared their frown: Ye battled for man's hope; God's Church confessed: Warriors, sleep well; for ye have earned your rest. XXVI. THE WORLD'S APPRECIATIONS. Minuter minds conceive not what is great: To them 'tis nothing as to fleshly ears The music of the planetary spheres: Its full-faced presence leaves them unelate; And when, submissive to all-mastering fate, That greatness dies, or, deathless, disappears, Upon its grave the triflers drop no tears, The feasters not one hour their jests abate. To such what meant that Roman Kingship hoar, Link of the old world with ours? A gaud, now gone! —'Tis thus when parents die! the wife, the son Weep by the bier; the poor beside the door: Small shapes that buzz around feel anguish none: To cricket and to moth the house is as before. XXVII. THE HIGHER CIVILIZATION. Blow struck at Rome an instant echo hath In every land where sits the Church a guest: The centre's there. A local church oppressed By popular madness or a tyrant's wrath Not less, like Thecla, lions in her path, May stand secure; though galled in head and breast May work God's work, then take a martyr's rest Cecilia-like, within the crimsoned bath Of her own blood. Meantime the Church is free, Her doctrine sure while free He sits at Rome Who speaks the authentic voice of Christendom: His Faith, all know, is hers. If bound were He, The whole no longer could secure the part: The world's broad hand would lie upon the Church's heart. PART III. XXVIII. THE TEMPORAL POWER. That one high realm which, not through fraud or force But for man's need, with glad consent of men Rose when the Roman empire lay a corse, And the Northern Beast forth bounding from his den Ravined alike on priest and citizen Hath oftenest fallen. Bandits without remorse Plotters low-voiced, and Peoples blasphemy-hoarse, Have wrought its fall again and yet again: Yet evermore that Hand beyond the skies Which raised it first, restores that Sign august: The nations wake; they stare with wondering eyes; 'Tis there, that Power! It lives because it must! The shade it is of Peter's Rock: far hurled It heaves along the great waves of the world. XXIX. AUSTRIA AND SPAIN. IL GRAN RIFIUTO. Austria and Spain, high daughters of a Past So rich in rites of sage civility, To Kings so loyal, yet in heart so free, So true to ancient Faith when Error's blast O'er the blind North in passionate tempest passed, So filial to the Apostolic See, So firm when Unbelief and Anarchy Down the prone gulfs dragged France so far and fast, And Nations silent stood:—What Sin, what Fate What poison froze your blood to stagnant gall When burst false Piedmont through that Roman gate? Lament, brave Cid, if souls can weep in heaven! Crowned Pole, When John Sobieski, King of Poland, after destroying the Turkish Army encamped around Vienna, made his entrance into the city, the People received him with the shout, ‘There was a man sent from God whose name was John.’ lament! By that strong hand was driven The earth-conquering Moslem from Vienna's wall! XXX. THE NATIONS OF CHRISTENDOM. The Mother of the churches was perforce The Mother of the Nations; for in each That moral mind, pure will, true heart and speech Which urge great Nations starlike on their course Found in Religion, there alone, its source: 'Twas hers the majesty of Law to teach; To exalt high ends, illicit means impeach; 'Twixt loyal and obsequious make divorce. A clan can boast its past and wreak its rage; A firm can waft its bales o'er lands and seas; A school can paint its picture, write its page: What is it makes a Nation more than these? That ‘Law of Nations’ which to lawless might Limits assigns; gives sovereignty to Right. XXXI. THE LAW OF NATIONS. The Law of Nations died the death that hour When Rome, the moulder of the Nations, fell: O'er earth and heard by all rang out the knell When first above the Capitolian tower Far streamed the standard of the Lawless Power: Nor less o'er palace, camp, and citadel That hour a whisper crept—inaudible To lands of honour reft, old Europe's dower; ‘Let us depart.’ Their patron Saints august Left they that hour the Nations? We, since then, Have seen strange omens and shall see again; Treaties are null! no realm the rest can trust! A shameful day draws to a stormy close: But whence or when the vengeance no man knows. XXXII. ST. GREGORY THE GREAT AND CHARLEMAGNE.1. Gregory! To thee her Faith our England owes; But ere to England thine Augustine sailed Rome had in thee her secular ruler hailed: Freely her bishop for her prince she chose. Two ages passed, then Charlemagne arose: Crowned by Pope Leo 'mid his barons mailed He swore to shield thenceforth God's Church assailed By force or fraud. Unlike these days to those! The family of Kings have wrought a wrong First on their kingdoms' honour, next their own: What wrong? The Sire of Kings lay late o'erthrown By hand usurping and the lying tongue; Kings sat and kept the clothes of that wild throng: On Kings the loss shall fall—but not on Kings alone. XXXIII. ST. GREGORY THE GREAT AND ENGLAND.2. As when, descending from that God-led bark At last on Ararat's broad summit stayed A ruined earth's sad heir yet undismayed Forth paced with all his sons the Patriarch; As when above that world of waters stark He stood while down they rushed and standing prayed; As when he followed, through some wave-worn glade With over-arching horns of granite dark That Hand which pointed still he knew not where:— Thus with his monks went forth from yonder pile Augustine missioned to that northern isle; Yon Cœlian Hill descended thus footbare; Thus found that wilderness he sought; thus trod A stony land of death and gave that land to God. XXXIV. THE NOBLE REVENGE. The nations stood around thee, frowning some Some coldly pitying when thy head lay low: On them what good for ill wilt thou bestow When Wrong that overcame is overcome? When earth in Faith's eclipse lies cold and numb; When pride hath reaped the fruits she holp to sow; When anarch peoples hurled from wealth to woe In vain deplore their vanished Christendom; When from the nether night, his penal prison By spurious science loosed the Apostate Angel Lifts his red bond and claims the astonished lands Shine thou that hour, a sun from night new-risen, Chase thou with thine his foul, disproved evangel: Raise thou thy Cross, and bind the Murderer's hands! XXXV. Yet, yet, ye Kings, and rulers of the earth Lift up your eyes unto the hills eterne Whence your salvation comes! From earth's dark urn The great floods burst! O'er each ancestral hearth Look forth, ye bold and virtuous Poor, look forth; The meteor signs of woes to come discern; And whence the danger be not slow to learn; Then greet it with loud scorn and warlike mirth. The banner of the Church is ever flying! Less than a storm avails not to unfold The Cross emblazoned there in massive gold: Away with doubts and sadness tears and sighing! It is by faith, by patience, and by dying That we must conquer as our sires of old. XXXVI. WALTER SCOTT AT THE TOMB OF THE STUARTS IN SAINT PETER'S.1. The wild deer, when the shaft is in his side Seeks his first lair beneath the forest hoar: Drawn back from reboant deeps the exhausted tide Breathes his last sob on the forsaken shore: When on the village green the sports have died The child stands knocking at his grandsire's door: So stands by this far tomb of Scotland's pride Her greatest son, death-doomed, and travel-sore. So stand, last Singer of the Heroic Age! Dead are those years so loyal, brave, and high That whilome blazoned History's Missal page, Ring yet through thy glad Minstrel-Breviary: Old Pilgrim, ended is thy pilgrimage This hour. The shadows round thee close: now die! XXXVII. WALTER SCOTT AT THE TOMB OF THE STUARTS IN SAINT PETER'S.2. Staff-propt he stands and all his country's past Streams back before his sadly-kindling eye; King after King, as cloud on cloud when fast The storm-rack rushes through the autumnal sky: Aughrim to Flodden answers! on the blast Now Mary's, now the Bruce's standards fly: Those earliest, Irish, kings he sees at last Cross-crowned on old Iona's shores who lie. Thus as he gazed, a Voice from vault and shrine Whispered around him—and from Peter's Tomb— ‘Not one alone but every Royal Line To my strong gates, as thou to these, shall come Heart-pierced at last: for mine they were; and mine The cradles and the graves of Christendom.’ XXXVIII. THE ‘ARA CŒLI’ ON THE CAPITOL. Here, where of old the Roman Senate sate, Where, thundering from his Capitolian throne Co-regent of the Universal State Jove o'er that Roman sceptre laid his own, For centuries the Franciscans, humbly elate Kept their aerial haunt and vigil lone Here, like that lark which ‘sings at heaven's gate’ Sang, first, Rome's Christmas carols;—they are gone! Far down beneath, the Benedictines lay Of Orders first; far down whose science soared The Dominican Order. Highest; far down Ignatius' Templars, The Company of Jesus. they Who raised o'er earth the Crosier and the Sword: Here reigned the triumph of Humility: Thy pagan triumph, Pride, is here restored. XXXIX. THE RESTORATION. A Sorrow that for shame had hid her face Soared to Heaven's gate and knelt in penance there Beneath the dusk cloud of her own wet hair Weeping, as who would fain some deed erase That blots in dread eclipse baptismal grace: Like a felled tree with all its branches fair She lay—her forehead on the ivory stair— Low murmuring, ‘Just art Thou, but I am base:’ Then saw I in my spirit's unsealed ken How Heaven's bright hosts thrilled like the dews of morn When May-winds on the sacred, snowy thorn Change diamonds into rubies: Magdalen Arose, and kissed the Saviour's feet once more And to that suffering soul His peace and pardon bore. XL. Nations self-cheated, this shall come to pass— From yonder altar to their kingdoms down True Kings once more shall pace, sceptre and crown On that dim sea of marble and of brass Showering, as angels on the sea of glass Their amaranth crowns. All Powers once more shall own Man's debt perpetual to Saint Peter's throne, All lands there find their Freedom's shield. Alas! What now are Kings? A thousand years each nation Claimed to stand subject to a Father's eye: All realms invoked the Apostle's arbitration An unseen world their strength and unity: Proud kings, proud realms, your victory is your loss! That rule is brief which rests not on the Cross. XLI. SAINT PETER. Rock of the Rock! As He, the Light of Light, Shows forth His Father's glory evermore, So show'st thou forth the Son's unshaken might Throned in thy unity on every shore: On thee His Church He built; and though all night Tempests of leaguering demons round it roar The Gates of Hell prevail not, and the Right Beams lordliest through the breaking clouds of war. Strength of that Church! the Nations round thee reel; Like hunted creatures Kingdoms flee and pant; But God upon His Church hath set His seal, Fusing His own eternal adamant Through all its bastions and its towers in thee: Luminous it stands through thy solidity. XLII. SAINT PETER. First of the Faith he made confession sole Taught by the Father, not by flesh and blood: Then He the parts Who strengthens by the Whole Bade him make strong his brethren, and the rod Gave him of kingship. By that Syrian flood Lastly, a Love thrice-challenged he confessed That singly passed the love of all the rest And straightway to his hand Incarnate God Lifting that Hand which made the worlds, accorded Rule of His flock world-wide both fair and pure: The mystery of His might in One he hoarded That all, made one, might live in one secure: In Christ the race redeemed is One;—in thee Forth stands, a Sacrament, that Unity. THE END</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. VI. LEGENDS AND RECORDS OF THE CHURCH AND THE EMPIRE TO The Honourable Mrs. Robert O'Brien. NOTE. ‘History as written,’ etc., p. xxvi, line 13— Coleridge expresses himself thus on Gibbon's ‘Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire’: ‘No distinct knowledge of the actual state of the empire can be obtained from Gibbon's rhetorical sketches. He takes notice of nothing but what may produce an effect; he skips on from eminence to eminence, without ever taking you through the valleys between. ... When I read a chapter in Gibbon, I seem to be looking through a luminous haze or fog; figures come and go, I know not how or why, all larger than life, or distorted, or discoloured. Nothing is real, vivid, true; all is scenical, and, as it were, exhibited by candle-light. And that poor scepticism which Gibbon mistook for Socratic philosophy has led him to misstate and mistake the character and influence of Christianity in a way which even an avowed infidel or atheist would not and could not have done. Gibbon was a man of immense reading, but he had no philosophy.’—Coleridge's ‘Table Talk,’ vol. ii. pp. 231, 232. When will the Christian, the philosophical, and the true history of the ‘Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire’ be written? Part I THE ROMANO-BARBARIC AGES THE LEGEND OF SAINT THECLA. ARGUMENT. Saint Paul preaches Christ at Iconium, standing on a stone where many ways meet; and Thecla, a noble virgin, sees him not, but hears his discourse daily for three days, standing at a window. She believes gladly; and hearing that the Apostle has been scourged and commanded to depart from that city, she desires of him two things, namely, baptism at his hand, and admission among them who minister to him. St. Paul baptizes her, but denies her second request, announcing that God has reserved for her a higher task. Thecla is sentenced to be thrown to wild beasts, but is saved from death. She journeys southward to Mount Taurus; and there, being led by the Holy Spirit into all knowledge, she preaches to the shepherd race, and after many years brings them into the obedience of Christ. Her task fulfilled, she departs to Seleucia on the sea; and she is named ‘The eldest daughter of Saint Paul.’ In Seleucia she dies; and to this day a singular honour is accorded to her at Christian death-beds. When holy Paul westward had made his way From Antioch to Iconium, he abode With Onesiphorus, preaching day by day In market-place, or on the common road, Or standing on a stone, with feet firm-set, Where four long streets, by plantains bordered, met. It chanced that in a house that stone hard by There dwelt a damsel, Thecla, young and fair, Dear to the poor for heart and lineage high, Dear to the rich, for she was richest there: And so for her great riches and sweet face Iconium's proudest sons besought her grace. Thecla was not to marriage rites inclined, For from her childhood she had treasured still The dream of some Deliverer, conquering, kind, Courteous in word, resistless in his will, In act heroic, and august in thought, Yet nought had seen like that her fancy wrought. To festal games that maid would seldom go, Never to fanes where pagan dance and song Surprised with painful blush a cheek of snow And did to heathen rites themselves a wrong: Her more it pleased in fragrant glades to roam Than sit at Circus or at Hippodrome. Alone beside that poplar-girded lake, Iconium's mirror-bath, she paced at noon; At eve o'er rocky heights her path would take, And watch far flashes from the ascended moon Like sea-gleams glimmering from a sea-bird's wings, Illume remoter Halys' mountain springs. With laughing girls alone she twined the dance Where leaned the green reed 'gainst the silvered rill: There, if wild youths in frolic or by chance Broke on them, through the thickets green and still They fled, far scattered like the pearls that gem When the cord bursts, some queenly diadem. Of all the Olympian choir she loved but one, The Queen of Night, and ofttimes frowned, aggrieved At that strange legend of Endymion: At most its merest outline she believed; ‘The boy was good: she kissed him as he slept; Then passed: he woke; found no one near, and wept.’ A youth with manors broad but ill of life, In part his wasted fortunes to repair, In part from love this fair one sought for wife: Urgent and loud her parents propp'd his prayer: ‘Iconium's best has proffered you his hand:’ Her ‘no’ meant that they could not understand. They pressed her oft: weariness too can jest:— One eve as Dian's brow, through cloud descried, Nigh setting cast a faint beam from the West That tinged not lit the wan lake's shallows wide, Laughing she spake: ‘Let Dian make a sign: Its import I—none better—can divine. ‘I note long since all meanings of her face; Have seen her startled as the roe that flies; Beheld her bend the chalice of her grace O'er harvest slopes; marked her reluctant rise Like some poor maid ere noontide to be wed; Have watched her weep like mourners o'er the dead. ‘On a silk scarf blue as her midnight heaven My hands those lily flowers she loves shall braid: My patron she: to her it shall be given When crescent next. If, rising o'er yon glade, Her brows distempered lour, or softly shine, I shall know well, and make her answer mine.’ Her father laughed:—‘To Dian make your vows! Good choice! Your Dian's placable as fair! She loves true maids; when true maid turns to spouse Scorns not, more late, the young mother's frightened prayer, Lucina then. Work hard! Next week we spend, I and your mother, with our Phrygian friend.’ With wrinkling brows much labouring to look wise Again he laughed, admiring his own wit: Thecla laughed too, lifting on his her eyes Albeit his meaning she discerned no whit: Her mother smiled; ‘Work, Thecla! Work—and think!’ She nodded; and her eyes began to blink. At morn while sat the maid with flower-like hand Braiding white flowers into that mantle blue, She heard, without, a voice of high command: Close to the casement scarf in hand she drew: She sat no more: there hung she hour by hour Listening: that kingly voice still swelled in power. Forward full oft she bent, yet nought could see Save wandering crowds clustered with eyes fast fixed On him who spake—to her invisibly. Not far he stood; but him and her betwixt A low-roofed fane there rose. The hours rushed by: Around her feet that scarf lay movelessly. But though she saw not him, before her passed The things whereof he spake, by power benign Within her phantasy immaculate glassed As in nocturnal seas each starry sign: Single her eye; her heart was without flaw: Through strength of faith the things she heard, she saw. She saw the angel of the Annunciation; She saw that Maid who, startled by his word, To that all strange yet heavenly Salutation Replied, ‘Behold the Handmaid of the Lord.’ She saw that light which clothed her as the sun Then when she spake the words, ‘Thy will be done.’ She saw her o'er that hilly region wending; Saw her beside her time-worn cousin's door; She saw the Bethlehem star, the Magians bending Their splendour-smitten heads that Babe before: She saw that Mother tremble; then, restored, Meet with calm front Simeon's predicted sword. She saw that mount whence He, the Son of Man, Launched o'er the earth His new Beatitudes Like Seraphs winged; nor less with flail and fan Lashed back to demon-haunted solitudes Those glittering Woes, blessings by this world held, That kept mankind so long in blindness spelled. She saw that Garden of Gethsemane; She saw God's angel hold the chalice forth High in both hands; she saw those sleepers three; Saw One Who knelt with forehead nigh the earth; With aching heart she saw, the branches through, Those sacred blood-drops reddening grass and dew. And ever as those sequent pictures rose And to her spirit's vision clave and clung, She heard, like torrent flood that seaward flows Through black ravines the cloud-girt woods among, Still heard that wondrous voice of him, the unseen, Which told of what must be, and what had been. It changed. She saw the hosts of the Forgiven That Conqueror entering Hades, rise to greet Him: From all the multitudinous gates of heaven She saw the Sons of God ride forth to meet Him: She saw the God-Man take the eternal Throne Cinctured by shining armies of His own. The great voice ceased: the twilight came: the night: Still by that casement stood that listening maid: The gloom but freshened with a keener light Those pictures in her amorous bosom stayed, Amorous of Truth; the stillness all night long Made that strong voice more spiritually strong. That night, as on her pillow sank her head, The moon, betwixt a cedar and a palm Ascending, bathed in light the virgin's bed: That light she marked not: glad she lay and calm: The sun of Faith full-orbed upon her shone: The moon-cast fancies from her soul were gone. So passed three days; daily the Apostle preached; Daily those silent throngs looked up in awe Their cheeks now flushed with joy, now conscience-bleached; Not once that preacher's face the listener saw; Wished not for more: ‘Faith comes by hearing;’ she Had Faith, nor cared with bodily eye to see. On the fourth morn was silence. Strange it seemed, Strange, but not sad. She stood in silent prayer, Palm joined to palm. With glorious memories teemed Her heart full-fed: God, like a river, there O'erflowed her being: Knowledge, not won from sense, Knowledge infused, filled her intelligence. Those Truths which from the unseen one she had heard Not barren in her spirit, but fruitful lay; They spread like growths sun-quickened and wind-stirred That sow their seeds till blows the breath of May And woodland lawns compact of violets lie, Celestial spaces of an under-sky. Daily she grew in wisdom and in vision; Daily in heart she gloried and rejoiced: Then in the midst of all that soul-fruition Sudden there fell a change. Two slaves low-voiced Conversed; ‘They spared his life, but scourged; next morn They drive him from Iconium forth with scorn.’ The other; ‘Nay, that prophet 'scaped right well, For many a man seduced he to his Faith; Of these not few in terror from it fell When to the præfect dragged: so rumour saith.’ They passed: then Thecla took her veil, and spread Its dusky tissue twice o'er face and head. She passed that pagan temple close at hand: Those meeting ways beyond baffled her eye: A beggar craved her alms: she made demand Where dwelt that prophet: he replied; ‘Close by With Onesiphorus.’ There she found him sitting On the stone threshold, nets for fishers knitting. 'Twas not her childhood's dream: yet all was well, For on his brow greatness was written plain: Before him on her knees the maiden fell, Then spake; ‘My boldness I might well arraign But I have heard thy word; and I believe; And baptism at thy hand would fain receive. ‘I crave a second boon: this city blind Spurns thee; and forth thou far'st again wayworn: To me unworthy be a place assigned 'Mong those by whom thy burdens still are borne. If women tend thee, let me share their joy: If men, I too can serve, in garb a boy.’ The Apostle fixed on her that beaming eye Which neither years nor sufferings could subdue: ‘Child! In your face a destiny I descry: God hath a nobler, sweeter task for you. What seek you, seeking Christ? You seek His cross! First bear, then preach it: all beside is dross.’ Baptized, her heart with joy within her burned: Winged by that joy she sought her home, and found Her mother, Theodora, late returned Her six days' absence ended. On the ground Still lay that scarf. One lily flower, but one, And that unfinished, 'gainst the purple shone. With reddening brow her mother thus began; ‘You sent me missive none: excuse I made: “On Dian's scarf”—'twas thus my fancy ran— “Doubtless she toils: her duteous fingers braid All round that votive mantle bud and flower!” You flung your bauble from you in an hour. ‘No doubt your Dian hid her head in cloud: No doubt some amorous trickster spake you fair: Thamyras may have heard of this: he's proud: I seek his house the mischief to repair: I never said the man was wise or true: I said he's rich, and good enough for you.’ The storm subsided: Thecla by her kneeling Humbly yet proudly told her mother all: That three days' preaching; all its power heart-healing And spirit-strengthening: next she spake of Paul; Her baptism, and her vow to cast aside All things for Christ, His handmaid and His bride. The storm burst forth: upon her daughter's head, Pacing that floor a wildered shape and wild, She hurled her curse: next to Thamyras sped: Denounced that daughter's crime. The young man smiled: ‘These be girls' tricks! I come to-morrow morn: You'll see your convert laughingly forsworn.’ He came. As those who knowing well the face Forget all else, thus wondering sat the maid Thamyras entering; with her wonted grace Then gave him welcome, and his pardon prayed. Her thoughts had tracked bright regions: men like him To her were ‘men like trees’—poor shadows dim. He urged her first with banter, then with pleas Such as the emptiest head can quickliest find: The Christian new replied as one that sees To colour-lectures from the man born blind: A lover's supplications next he tried: She answered, ‘Christ I love; seek nought beside.’ With baleful smile the vanquished man departed: His love, self-love disguised, had changed to hate; A specious man, yet base and evil-hearted: Ere long he reached a soldier-guarded gate: Three times he paused; but deep within him sin That day held carnival: he entered in. It was Iconium's chiefest Basilic: Beyond a pillared nave there hung an arch, Poised upon porphyry columns dusk and thick: Beneath its span a bannered host could march: Ranged round the apse Iconium's judges sate Down-gazing, dark as death, and fixed as fate. Thamyras spake; ‘Judges, to this high hall Hourly, I note, your lictors with their rods Hale wretches starved whom late the Apostate, Paul, Once Jew, seduced to scoff the Roman Gods; Shall nobles 'scape, where slaves unlettered bleed? Thecla is Galilean, rite and creed.’ Gladly those judges would have closed their ears, Devised some cause for doubt or for delay: They dared not: round them circled scoffs and sneers; Soon, like sea-thunders in some cliff-girt bay, Uprose the popular tumult, and the cry, ‘If Thecla be a Christian let her die!’ That crowd gave way: before them Thecla stood; Beauteous and basking like a rose new blown. She smiled on that tumultuous multitude: Majestical as queen upon her throne She spake at last; glorying, her Christ confessed; Bade all who heard adore Him and be blessed. The judgment followed;—‘To the Lions!’ She Received that sentence with a quiet smile: Once more in storm that people's mad decree Rolled forth. Not scared, yet sad, she stood awhile; Still on her lip that smile all golden hung; ‘Thou wilt not blame them, Lord; they mean no wrong.’ The noble tale could scarce more fitly end Than here; for what are miracles extern Compared with gifts interior that descend From God on hearts like hers for Him that yearn? Not less to Christ's last gift humbly we cleave; ‘These signs shall follow them, my followers, that believe.’ St. Mark xvi. 17. Such signs were oft vouchsafed: the old books aver That when upon the arena Thecla stood Within Iconium's amphitheatre, The imprisoned beasts beneath ravening for blood, That lion loosed to rend her dared not meet The martyr's eye. He cowered and licked her feet. A second bounded on that stage: the first Fought, her defender; each by each was slain: The maid betwixt them stood. That crew accursed Devised for her new torments, but in vain, The sword, the pyre. Full many a death she died In will, not deed: God's shield their rage defied. Then rose Iconium's sons, and thus they said; ‘She must not die! Perchance this maid is dear To Gods Iconium knows not, and, when dead, May draw on us their vengeance. Let her steer Her little wanton bark what way she will: The girl's a fool: we meant to fright, not kill.’ Next morn they pushed her from their gateway forth: Southward huge Taurus heaved his range of snows; Rose-red Lycanus slanted t'ward the north: The loftier heights, the austerer path, she chose, And heard next day from Taurian peaks that pæan Anthemed in thunder from the waves Ægean. There Thecla made her mountain hermitage; There lived in ecstasies of praise and prayer, Blithe as a bird that 'scapes its gilded cage And houses in green forests. Everywhere She saw Creation's God, the All-Good, the All-Wise; Saw Him forth-gazing from that Saviour's eyes. She unamazed could mark the snowy ridges, The noontide cloud that o'er them swam or slept, The rainbow torrent dashed o'er icy ledges, The mist that o'er the sighing pinewoods crept:— These were beginnings: Thecla with one bound Passed such things by, and sat with contemplation crowned. Total Creation seemed the robe of Him The great Creator; and its every fold Revealed to her, though but in outline dim, The God beneath. In faith she laid her hold Upon ‘His garment's hem;’ and evermore Virtue divine welled thence her being o'er. Fair were those peopled vales: in them she dwelt As Eremite 'mid Lybian sands, alone: She lived in God, and all the earth, she felt; Formed but one marble footstep for His throne: Yet flower-like was her heart, sweetness sans sin— It was God's Eden; yea, He walked therein. To her close by shone out the things remote: For that cause holier seemed the things close by: Them too the eternal light of Duty smote: All service service seemed of One on high: Worldlings though seeking God, sleep oft, oft faint: No man is wholly Theist save the Saint. No other wholly loves his kind: she dipped The blind man's pitcher in the darkling wave: She cheered the sick-room chill: the vines she clipped That made its casement gloomy as the grave: She stayed the widow's tears: from unknown skies She flashed new light into the orphan's eyes. What wonder if the mountain shepherds deemed That guest well worthy hymn and incense rite? Dian herself, their grateful fancy dreamed, For their wild dells had left her Latmian height! She preached a greater; else their zeal had crowned That maid the Queen of all their mountain bound. The little rock-built mountain villages Raised, each, its banner, near them as she drew; Children, aye babes, with unashamed caress Welcomed her: that she loved them well they knew: She looked so like the tidings that she preached, With spring's delight the old man's heart they reached. Polemic proof, when boastfullest, proves unstable, Powerless for God-like action, prompt for strife: Music lives on, a power irrefutable: Religion sets to music mortal life. Still to His Church, bleeding yet unenslaved, ‘God added daily such as should be saved.’ The days went by, and ever year by year She spread abroad the Name Divine and Mary's, The blithesomest of Christ's hermit saints austere, The tenderest of His Church's missionaries: At last to God that mountain land was won: At last Saint Paul's predicted ‘task’ was done. Then came to her a longing for the ocean Whose harmonies the night winds oft had brought her: She sought Seleucia; there with strange emotion Paced day by day beside the blue, green water Wherein the Infinite best is typified: There happy she abode two years; then died; Seleucia of Cilicia. Farther East Cilician Tarsus, ‘no mean city,’ stands, Where he self-styled ‘of all the Apostles least’ Was born, and lived by labour of his hands. T'ward it each eve had Thecla gazed; and all Named her ‘the eldest daughter of Saint Paul.’ Later men gave the maid a name more holy, ‘The Proto-martyr of the woman-race;’ And o'er her sea-lulled grave, humble and lowly, A wearied man new-touched by childhood's grace, The Emperor of the East, Justinian, reared, Five centuries passed, a fane by all revered. Likewise God's Church, which evermore condoles With mortal pangs, in that supremest prayer ‘The Commendation of Departing Souls,’ To her concedes a praise none others share: In that last prayer Thecla hath part: in it No name beside but names of Holy Writ. ‘Go forth, O Christian Soul, in the name of Him The Father, and the Son, and Holy Spirit, In the name of Cherubim and Seraphim, And Saints of earth that heavenly thrones inherit: God give thee, Christian Soul, a good release: God in His Sion stablish thee in peace. ‘Deliver him, God, as Thou, in days of yore, Deliver'dst Noah, Job, and Abraham, And Paul and Peter from their anguish sore, As Thou deliver'dst Thecla, that sweet name, From beasts and tyrants' rage, and demon snare; Save him, Thou Saviour: Judge all-righteous, spare.’ SAINT DIONYSIUS, THE AREOPAGITE. (DIED A.D. 96.) ARGUMENT. St. Dionysius was one of the judges of the Court of Areopagus when St. Paul announced there the Faith. He became one of the few converts made there by the Apostle, and was later created by him bishop at Athens, where he died a Martyr. The night before his death he recalls those things in his past life which led up to that happy end; his early distrust of Athens, much as he loved it; his scorn of its Sophists; his abode in Egypt; the great marvel witnessed there and elsewhere during the Crucifixion; and likewise that vision in which he was permitted to see the Nine Hierarchies of Angels. The Athenians ne'er were cruel: from the first Persuasion as a Goddess they revered, To Pity gave her temple. They have chosen For me fair prison: through its window bars The violet odours of the violet city Reach me from vale and plain. Reed-loved Ilyssus Whispers far off; and here and there a harp Reports of happy listeners round it ranged, Happy; the younger doubtless innocent; While full before me from the Acropolis The Parthenon sends forth its snowy gleam. Minerva Polias, Wingless Victory, The Propylea—great that thought, to place The city's fortress near its chief of temples— Are hid. I see the Parthenon alone. The first and holiest court in Greece is this, Our Areopagus. At first, men say, It held its sacred sessions in the dark Lest aught that moves the sense might warp the award. 'Tis sage in earthly things; in things of heaven Some strange judicial blindness on it falls: It saw in Paul ‘a preacher of new Gods:’ The noblest man in earlier Athens born Old Socrates, it slew. If me it slays 'Twill do injustice to itself, not me: I never valued life; in what men value I struck not root profound. Brighter each hour Yon Parthenon makes answer to the moon, Pallas to Dian. These the fablers old Revered as sisters. Maiden were they both: I never gazed upon the Parthenon Without this thought, what depths, while pure herself, Clear-sighted Athens saw in purity; With what a diverse skill she sang its glories— A Pallas, strenuous, sage, self-mastering, proud, A Dian, all too bright, too swift for stain, A Hebè; Purity meant childhood there, An accident; in Iris 'twas essential, A Spirit was she, spanning a fleshly world; The Muse, with her 'twas life all intellect; Great Vesta, holy there, and venerable, Vigil it kept o'er hearths. What worlds of Thought Here met until one lily flower of earth Grew wider than the firmament eterne! What worlds! O Greece, when centuries had gone by The virtue honoured in thy youth was that By thee in age most trampled! For that cause God's truth from thee is hid. Was it to lure My heart by beauty of this visible world From spiritual hopes, they chose for me this prison? For still the vision of that purple deep By me so often from Eleusis watched, Clipping at once far isles and headlands near Clings to mine eyes. I will not think of these: This earth is not our mother, or our sister: For some it hath, I fear, the syren's snare. O what a snare to thee, my Greece, was beauty! Thy fancy robbed thy heart. Beauty to thee Was beauty's ruin. Truth must needs be beauteous: Yea, but that smile about her lips for thee Cancelled the lovelier terrors of her brow, The ardours of her eyes. Thou mad'st thy pact Thus with Religion: ‘Charm, but scare me not!’ The shadows of high things to thee were dear; Their substance was offence. A subtler snare Thou found'st in Dialectics. What was that Which made me, wild and wayward as I was, In this unlike thee? Was it my mother's prayer Dead at my birth? ‘The shaft of Artemis Slew her,’ men told me weeping on her grave A six years' orphan. Many a dangerous friend In that stern sport was keener thrice than I: They mixed with youthful pleasures large discourse Of seers from Solon to the Stagyrite, Yea, Epicurus. Most were of his crew, While many, his in life, in spleen of thought Walked with the Stoic, or with mincing step Glided from path to path of Academe Boasting its freedom. Others proud of lore Forgotten by the crowd were large in praise Of earlier names. ‘ “All things from water come,” Thus taught old Thales. Anaxamines Made answer, “Not from water but from air:” Heraclitus replied to both, “from fire.” Anaximander sware that chaos grew By force inherent to the world we tread: Some cried the universe was rife with Gods: And some that Gods were none. The Ionian School And Eleatic strove. Zenophanes Warred on the priests; Parmenides not less:’ Thus babbled those around me. Mute I sat: Sudden one day in wrath I rose: I cried, ‘Ye men of Greece, your prophets were impostors! They churned their metaphysic seas of words As girls a milk-pail, but extracted thence No food for man or beast. Your great State-Founders Were dreamers, basing Polities of Law On lawless wills: the boast of each was this In turn, to plant a colony in chaos!’ Thus I continued; ‘Philosophic Systems! Not for asserting wonders scorn I these: The Truth, when known, will prove more wondrous thrice; If ever ours, will be its own clear proof, A sun that tasks our eyes yet lights our world; Conquering through love, and crowned by man's consent: As little hurl I scoff at rite or creed Because rich priests have trafficked in such wares: Best things are most abused:—for this I scorn them, Because they nothing brought to heart or spirit Which helped the helpless. Plato was my guide: He gave me much: but this he gave not—rest. He spake of God: I read with beating heart; Yet ofttimes cried, “Believes he what he speaks?” A God! What means a God? To me He means Some heavenly Bender from some infinite height Who stoops to raise mankind. Know this, Athenians, Ye shall not find such God by Syllogisms. Either some herald from some land remote Will bring the news; “He lives! That God is ours!” Or breaking from His heavens that God will cry, “Behold I come at last.”’ My friends reproved me: ‘Theosophist, and not philosopher Art thou! In mystic India seek thy home.’ I passed to Egypt. Heliopolis, That priestly city, sacred to the past, Received me. There I made abode ten years. Its inmates loved me well. I said, ‘Those priests Who claim no philosophic lore, nor boast That from her well their agile wand can lift Truth by the hair, and fling her in the sun Naked to common gaze; who guard Traditions; Who from their ancient rites, long brooding, draw Meaning occult that grows o'er Thought's broad dial Slowly as obelisk's shade o'er evening sands; Those priests hold more of Truth than all our Schools: They welcomed Orpheus, Homer, Solon, Plato, And, greater yet, Pythagoras. He had found, Six centuries since, beneath this visible mask Of shape and hue of motion and of rest, The spiritual basis of the universe, Mathesis awful yet all musical, Ungrasped by sense, alone by Reason known. He taught men lore forgotten now; that Earth With many a planet sweeps around the Sun, Not he round Earth, and with her sister orbs Makes part of heaven.’ Those Seers Egyptian spake Ofttimes of Hebrew Prophets. These, I learned, Discoursed long since on social Polities, But not like Greeks. They ever made proclaim, Kingdoms that stand are reared on Righteousness, Not on man's will; his pleasure or his pride. How strange the difference 'twixt the quick Greek mind And these Contemplatives! To them each Truth Was as a thing to rest on—kneel upon, Die on, content to die. To the Greek a Truth Meant but a thought. He stept from off it lightly: 'Twas but a stepping-stone athwart a stream: From stone to stone he stept, and then forgot them. The Egyptian sage with what he knew of Truth At least held commerce true. To the best of these One day I put that question mine so oft, ‘Who made the worlds?’ He answered thus: ‘A God Who tells not yet His Name.’ While thus he spake Behold a wonder! Darkness o'er the land Rushed sudden: dreadful night was over all: The stars shone through it terrible of face As though they too had died. Three hours went by: To him that knelt beside me thus I spake, Apollophanes, comrade of my youth, ‘That God who made the universe hath died This hour; and all creation mourns her Lord.’ That hour the Lord of all had died indeed: Far off, on Calvary's height, had died for man: He died; and darkness swept o'er all the earth. 'Twas then that Athens, awed, that altar raised, ‘Unto the God Unknown.’ The years went by: At last in Athens Paul, my master, stood: He marked that altar. Fronting it, men say, He knelt with hands outstretched in prayer three hours. By it next day his judges thus he judged, The self-same court which judges me to-morrow; ‘Ye have an altar to the God Unknown: Him I declare to you.’ With him there strove The Stoics, and the sect of Epicurus, While sat the sons of Plato reverence-mute. Some, when he preached the Resurrection, laughed: Some said, ‘More late discourse we on this matter.’ Then from that city of the proud he passed To Corinth of the sinners, and from her Built up a Church to God. I thank Thee, God, That 'mid those few our Athens gave Thy Son I found a place—the lowest. Humble and glad Ofttimes I walked, the comrade of Saint Paul Journeying from Church to Church. I listened mute, For even as Moses in the Egyptian lore Was mighty, such was Paul in lore of Greece. At times of Greek Philosophy he spake, Spake kindly, yet with sad rebuke. He said, ‘Philosophy at best is mind's ascent From earth to heaven, an arrow shot in the air: Not thus the Faith: 'tis ours but by descent From heaven to earth, even as Incarnate God Is ours descending from the Eternal Sire. That verity mankind can ne'er transcend On earth, in heaven. How high soe'er man soars That Truth—the God-Man—still shall over-soar him; That Truth God-given, for that the Martyrs bleed: For speculative systems no man dies.’ At times he touched on lowlier themes:—‘The men Who built in Greece her manifold polities Were great in mind; yet, building not on God, Their polities are dust.’ I recognized The teaching of those Hebrew Prophets old, ‘Kingdoms that stand are built on Righteousness,’ And later thus their reasonings harmonized. Man's social life, not less than personal life, Is fountained from above. The stateliest Realm, What is it but the Household magnified? The Household, what but Christ's fair Church foreshown? In both each citizen must love his brother; In both each subject reverence as from God His ruler; while that ruler in himself Sees this alone, the minister of all, And with all reverence loves his meanest subject. Yet oft my musings ended thus: a life There is, we know, not human, unlike ours, A race not body and soul, nor marriage-bred, All love, yet knowing nought of mortal bonds, A race that feels not after God through types But sees Him face to face—the Angelic Race. Roam they at will the starry worlds? To them What grades are fitted save the grades of Love? What need of States, or Homes? The Angelic City, How shows it to the City of the Saints? Then all that Sacred Scripture tells to man Of angel ministry in heart I pondered, And prayed of God to grant me angel lore: To some that knowledge might be help supreme, Since less by battling with the attempts of flesh Flesh is subdued than by forgetting flesh Through commerce with the skies. In thoughts like these One day upon the Asian coasts I rode Alone, the year that great Apostle died: The woods were passed: and lo! great Ephesus Before me stood; and Dian's sacred fane, A wonder of the world. Long hours that night, A rock my seat, I gazed upon that fane As on the Parthenon now. And I remembered How when great Socrates at Athens died That Parthenon had sent no thunders forth, Nor Dian's temple when within its ken Paul fought with beasts. Likewise I called to mind How once, once only, he, the Apostle Paul, That day he placed me o'er the Athenian Church, Low-voiced had told me that in years gone by He, in the body, or apart from body, Into the heaven of heavens had been upraised, And looked upon the visions of the Lord, And voices heard unlawful to repeat. Also that ‘Loved Disciple’ I recalled Who saw from Patmos isle the end of earth, And—o'er the grave of that twelfth Cæsar gazing— Far off the perfect triumph of the Just. Of Hermas too I thought, and of his Vision; ‘I saw the Church Triumphant, where it rose, A mighty tower rock-based 'mid raging seas: Six Angels of the Lord were building it: Nor ceased they from their toil.’ To me these things remembering, then and there Vision there came: if palpable that Vision Or else God-kindled in my subject soul, God knoweth, not I: each Vision is Divine. I saw the concourse of the Sons of God, The Hosts Celestial, passing in their number Perchance all atoms of all visible worlds; Images of God's beauty; bodily beings Compared with Him; spiritual with us compared; Fed from His Heart with knowledge and with power Their everlasting Eucharistic Feast; Intuitive in Intellect, with their gaze Ever on Beatific Vision fixed, Yet active here below, even as man's soul, Then most in Reason rests while works his hand. That Faculty Intuitive, their dower, Passed on to me through sympathy. I saw them, And knew their nature, even as Adam knew, When at God's will God's creatures passed before him, The end of each. Plainly on every grade Some Attribute divine had pressed its seal, Its character engraved;—three Hierarchies, Three Choirs in each. The Angels were the lowest: Their life was simplest, humblest ministration, Meek helpers of man's race. A breath of theirs Had power to quench the sun; yet their delight Was this; to be the servants of God's Poor. They could have passed all worlds, swifter than thought; Yet hour by hour delightedly they spent Wiling some child from peril, fire or flood: They who for ever heard the singing stars Counted the sick man's sighs. Their faces shone In rapture of good will. They felt for each What lovers feel for one. Higher I saw The Archangels potent o'er the Soul of Man As Angels o'er his life extern. 'Tis theirs To sway the elements of his spiritual being By inspirations brought man knows not whence Like winds that round the sunset heap the clouds; Above those two fair choirs I saw a third, The Principalities that hold in charge Nation, and City, and House. Next these the Powers: 'Tis theirs to urge the planets on their course, Rebrim the fiery chalice of the sun With beams not lost though hurled beyond our orb, Creation's wine that never runs to waste. Yet these high Energies are rhythmical: Their storms themselves are Order. As a river Winds from the hills, its countless water-drops Confluent in one unchanging course, so these; God's Living Laws are they, and for that cause Nature's not less, since Nature's sacred Laws Are not like edicts of a king deceased, Or bound in chains, or driven to banishment, But of a king rejoicing in his halls, Whose Face gives strength to all. Above the Powers The Virtues and the Dominations rise: Kingship divine o'er earth they hold suspense Spurn it who lists. Who hates God's Will, perforce Speeds it, God's purblind drudge. The peasant child Hath with the Dominations' choir a part Praying, ‘Thy kingdom come.’ When first I heard That choral shout, ‘The Thrones advance,’ and saw Their standards dawning on the Mount of God, I shook with awe. Vanished that fear like mist! Not triumph but submission was their joy: Their title thence:—they are not Gods but Thrones: Enthroned on them His Judgments Everlasting, His dread Decrees, His Counsels hid from men, Yea, secret as the chambers of the deep, Make visible way through all His universe: Their glory is to make these manifest, Their glory and their strength. To them His Will Steadies alone their being which sustains it, No more a burthen than the Spring to earth, Spring throned upon a hemisphere of flowers Their joy, their crown. The eighth celestial choir Far off I saw—a host innumerable That knelt upon a sunlit mountain's brow And eastward gazed as when from ocean cliff A panting people watch their fleet at dawn Returning victory-flushed. Of them that knelt Some fanned their wings; some screened therewith their eyes; All bent t'wards one great Vision. On their heads Its glory rested tremulously, and streamed To the utmost skirt of those far-shining robes Behind them stretched. Close by, a voice I heard: ‘Thou seest the Cherub choir: as thou on them They on that Beatific Vision gaze Whereof the feeblest flash would strike thee dead. The Cherubs these of whom Ezekiel spake That full they are of eyes—the Spirits of Knowledge In whom, so far as Knowledge Infinite Can find a mirror in the finite mind, God makes His Knowledge shine, since never they Pushed forth base hand to clutch forbidden fruit, Stealing God's gift reserved.’ As thus I gazed Behind me at immeasurable distance I heard the winnowing of innumerous wings, A universe all music. Fleet as thought O'er me they swept. In swiftness form was lost: They passed me as a lightning-flash that leaves Blindness behind. Again my head I raised: An instant on that Cherub Band remote And all the aerial ridge whereon they knelt That lightning flashed, and vanished. Then that Voice— ‘The Seraphs! Of the Third great Hierarchy The loftiest choir and holiest of the Nine! These are the Spirits of Love: their life is Love; That God-ward Love wherein all lesser loves First die; then live sublimed. So great their Love They know not that they seek in God their joy, Seeking that God alone. Through vacant space Alike, or bulk of intermediate worlds, God-ward they fleet and obstacle find none. That flight is rest: they can no more suspend it Than can the stone that falleth cease to fall, Since Love that speeds it still is self-renewed. That Vision Beatific deepens on them The nearer they approach His Throne. That Throne Not in the eternal ages shall they reach: The Infinite is infinite in distance:— Is this frustration? Nay, fulfilment best! The Infinite is infinitely near Not less, and nearest to the Spirits of Love.’ Again that Voice; ‘Think not the Spirits of Love Are less in knowledge than that Cherub Choir: Each loftier choir retains, yea, closelier clasps That special grace which names the choir beneath it, Retains, and lifts it to a higher heaven: The Spirits of Love in knowledge far transcend The Spirits of Knowledge, deeplier knowing this How worthy of love is God. Cherubs in turn Surpass in reverence for the Will Divine The Thrones who on their bosoms throne that Will: Perchance such reverence for that Will it was Which made such Knowledge theirs. In all the Choirs The glories of all virtues co-exist Diverse in measure. Such diversity Not envy breeds in heaven, but Love's increase: The amplest Spirits possess no gift not held Implicitly by least. To choirs beneath Exulting they transmit it. Seraphs thus Fling fires of Love on Cherubs. These in turn Redound, subdued to milder lights of wisdom, Their kinglier knowledge on the Choir of Thrones: Thence down to humbler choirs. One Virtue thus Too great, too pure to find a name on earth,— Its nearest earthly name is Charity— Sacred and prime there lives that in itself Blends all the Virtues, even as one great Truth, Ungraspable, we know, except by God, The paramount of Truths, conjoins all Truths: That Virtue not ascends but makes descent A chain long-linked dropt from the Throne of God, Through all the Angelic grades; descends to man Even as that one great Truth, the Lord of Truths— Its nearest name on earth is “God made Man”— Descends, man's heritage, to man's race, the sole That Spirit conjoins with Flesh.’ All-glorious Vision Vouchsafed to me unmeet, how oft, and most In danger's hour, my spirit hast thou made Still as the central seas! When first I saw thee I prayed that I might see thee in my death: Never since then hast thou so blessed my heart As on this night! Means this that death is near; Or comes it casual through the law of thought For this cause that when first that Vision graced me The Ephesian Temple stood before mine eyes As now yon Parthenon? The moon descends: Eastward that Temple's shadow slowly creeps: At dawn the Judges meet and speak the award. But Thou, O God, save Thine Athenian people! Crown her great gifts with this Thy best, to use Rightly the lesser. Reason is her boast: Wed it with Faith; that those two gifts, made one, May breed o'er earth a race of Truths divine, Raising a Christian Athens next to Rome! Ah me, how little knows or man or nation How near our hand a possible greatness lies Beyond all wish, all thought! THE LEGEND OF SAINT LONGINUS. ARGUMENT. The soldier who pierced with his spear the sacred side of our Divine Lord was, according to an ancient tradition, no other than that Centurion who afterwards made confession, ‘This was the Son of God.’ He fled to Cæsarea, in Cappadocia, where, abiding in penitence, he drew many to the Faith. The persecution under Nero reaching Cæsarea, Saint Longinus again makes confession of Christ. The Roman præfect condemns him to death, and is immediately struck blind; but Longinus promises to pray for him when with Christ. He keeps that promise, and not only the sinner's bodily eyes are restored to him, but the eyes of his spirit are opened also. The legend saith that when on Calvary Christ, God and Man, for man's redemption died, That soldier who transpierced His Heart was he Who later, conscience-smit, in anguish cried, When earthquake split the rocks and o'er the sod Darkness made way, ‘This was the Son of God.’ It saith that at the instant of his crime Blindness from God on that Centurion fell; That on his knees he sank and knelt long time; That cure there came to him by miracle: That with that blood which stained his spear, in awe Taught from above, he touched his eyes and saw. ‘Sinners shall look on Him they crucified’— The legend saith his eyes, thus opened, turned Straight to that wound purpling the Saviour's side; That more than eyes can see his heart discerned; That, ranged so late with sinners—with the worst— That soldier made of Christ confession first. He rose; in wrath he cast that spear away: Foot-bare he fled to Cappadocia's shore; There dwelt at Cæsarea: day by day He wept; ere passed a year his head was hoar: There thirty years he lived, and by his word And by his life drew many to his Lord. For evermore he preached to man and maid, ‘Cling to the Cross! That Cross retrieveth all; Raised on His Cross, Christ for His murderers prayed: He prayed for me, the last and least of all.’ And still to Christ he sued: ‘Since Thou for me Didst pray in death, grant me to die for Thee!’ Nero ruled Rome: for sport that Rome he fired, Then from a tower, while up the smoke-wreaths curled, Sang to his lyre, and feigned himself inspired; Next day, to shield a hated head, he hurled Abroad that charge, ‘The Christians' Crime,’ and dyed With innocent blood the ruins far and wide. At last to Cæsarea reached that cry: ‘If any scorn upon our gods to call, Why cumbereth he earth's pavement? Let him die!’ Longinus entered first the Judgment Hall: There sat the Roman præfect, robed and crowned; Twelve statued gods were ranged that court around. Thereof the lower half that hour was thronged By men in Cæsarea one time great And wealthy still; to them her lands belonged, And they to Rome, their army, and their state: Rome had required their presence there that day: They loved her not, yet dared not disobey. Lightly that præfect spake: ‘More serious task Than that of scourging fools, good friends, is mine: Longinus, speak: thou wear'st, I think, no mask, Rome's soldier once; her gods, remain they thine?’ He answered: ‘Mine they were that day gone by: My Christ forgave my sin; for His am I.’ Then fell on all a great astonishment: Across that præfect's face there passed a leer; Far back upon his gilded throne he leant, Then thus: ‘What further witness need we here? Yon man has courage: what he lacks is sense: Death by the axe! Ho, Lictors, take him hence!’ Of various minds that throng till then had stood: Most part were zealous for the pagan rites; Whilst others shrank from shedding brothers' blood For themes which, shrouded on the cloudy heights Of thought—for so they deemed—had never once To questioner given oracular response. But when her voice was heard whose voice was one, Whose Law o'er-ruled all laws, whose Will unflawed Spake to all lands, ‘Do this,’ and it was done, There came to them a change: not only awed, But with a servile rapture filled, aside They cast all doubts: ‘Death by the axe!’ they cried. Sadly the præfect of the Lictor band Approached to lead the sentenced to his death: Calmly Longinus drew from out his hand The axe; he spake, yet scarce above his breath: ‘I die: 'tis well; but first I will to show If these be gods ye worship—ay or no.’ Forward he stepp'd; sudden up-heaved on high, Facing that statued Jove, his battle-axe, And smote. From each stone idol rang a cry Piteous and shrill. Then, frail as shapes of wax, Those twelve strong gods fell shivered to the ground: The men who saw it stared in panic round. Their panic changed to anger. Where was now That fixed resolve and single, theirs so late, To stand with Rome close bound by will and vow? A single moment can precipitate A thousand jarring motions into one: A thread gives way: their unity is gone. That anger changed to madness: fury fell On those who thronged that hall, both guard and guest: Each smote at each: that hall seemed changed to hell; Its inmates into men by fiends possessed: One only in the midst serene and high Stood up unmoved; that man condemned to die. Unmoved he stands; who is it before him kneels Forth lifting, like some drowner in the wave, Hands ineffectual, agonized appeals, To him, the sole, who, if he wills, can save? That præfect on the sudden stricken blind! His victim thus made answer meek and kind: ‘I blame thee not; according to thy light Thou madest decree: by law thy word must stand. Fear nothing! God will give thee back thy sight; Let two young children take thee by the hand, And be to thee as eyes, and with soft tread On draw thee to my tomb when I am dead. ‘There kneel, and register thy vow; and I, If God gives grace, will prop with mine thy prayer; For though, ere regioned yet in yonder sky, Christians plead well, they plead more strongly there Where He Who grants each prayer that prayer inspires, The nearer nurslings of His heavenly fires.’ Next, turning to that raging host, he raised His hand, and made the Venerable Sign: And straight the tempest ceased. They stood amazed; Then, drawing to the sentenced, knelt in line; And thus he spake, as one who speaks with power: ‘Spirits impure, where dwelt ye till this hour?’ Then came an answer: ‘There where Christ is not, Where no man makes His Sign, or names His Name, We dwell; but most in idols deftly wrought: In them our palace-fortresses we claim; In yon poor wrecks for ages we had rest, Houseless through thee this hour, and dispossessed.’ To whom the Conqueror: ‘Think not that for long Ye shall retain man's godlike race your thrall; For Christ Who drave you forth so oft is strong, And strong the house of them on Him who call.’ He spake; then passed, with lictors girt around, To that fair hill-side named the ‘Martyrs' Mound.’ Softly it rose, half-girdled by a wood, Open elsewhere to every wind that blew, And violet-scented. On its summit stood A company of grave-stones—some were new— Grav'n with dear names of those in days gone by Who died in Christ, rejoicing thus to die. In those old days the name of ‘Holy Rest’ That hill sustained: but when the Roman sword Went forth 'gainst all who Christ their God confessed, The ‘Martyrs' Mound’ they named it, to record That laureled band which braved an empire's frown: Of these Longinus wore the earliest crown. They read the process: he no word thereof Noted: in heart he stood on Calvary; Looked up again upon that Lord of Love; Followed the Eternal Victim's wandering eye; Saw it once more upon him fix. It said: ‘Centurion, fear not; I for thee have prayed.’ Ah! then well knew he that Christ's potent word, His prayer, though spoken by the eye alone, The hour he spake it had in heaven been heard, Likewise another, later prayer—his own— Rushed on his memory back: ‘Since Thou for me Didst pray in death, grant me to die for Thee.’ They read the sentence: straight there fell such grace On that Centurion from the Crucified, Such splendour from the Eternal Father's Face, That well he knew—the moment ere he died— Those proud ones, late from demon bond set free Through prayer of his, Christ's servants soon would be. When the third morn, brightening the horizon's bound, Touched first the snow-white portals of that tomb New raised upon the holy ‘Martyrs' Mound,’ A stately man drew near it. Twilight gloom Between him and its bosky bases lay; But on its height the grave-stones laughed in day. Why should a man so stalwart pace so slowly? Why should a port stamped by habitual pride Sustain the shadow of a grace so lowly? What boys are those his doubtful steps who guide? Each clasps a hand—a little lags behind, Though zealous, shy. The man they lead is blind. Is this the man on whom, but three days since, All Cæsarea hung for life or death, In name a præfect, yet in power a prince? Whence came the change? Alas, how slight a breath Can shake the light leaf from the autumnal tree! When summer flushed his veins how firm was he! Before that tomb the vanquished Strong One knelt; Down on that grave his head discrowned he laid; With each blind hand its lintels cold he felt; He raised his sightless eyes: to God he prayed: At idol shrines he made that hour no plaint: To God he prayed; to God and to His Saint. In heaven God's Saints fix still their eyes on God; Yet, as a man beside a lake's clear mirror Notes well the trees behind him sway and nod In that still glass reflected without error So, in the mirror of God's knowledge high, His Saints the things of earth in part descry. Longinus from the haven of his rest Descried that suppliant bent and with him prayed While prayed with both the synod of the Blest; Since God, sole source of Love and loving aid, Wills that His creatures, each to each, should bear His gifts; and what He gives concedes to prayer; That so in heaven and here on earth alike All creatures may be links in one great chain Down which His gifts, innocuous lightnings, strike From loftiest to the least. Unmeasured gain Is this, since thus God's creatures, each and all, One temple grow through love reciprocal. A sinful soul is ofttimes not so far From God and aid divine as men suppose: The sea-rim brightens though unrisen the star; In him a star of hope thus gradual rose: He mused: ‘The Christian's God may help me yet! Longinus promised: he will not forget.’ Strong in that hope the blind man raised his eyes— O wondrous change! Where lately all was black Flashed the clear wave and laughed the purple skies: The sun had risen: the night, a cloudy wrack, Fled like some demon host repulsed with scorn; And as a pardoned Spirit rejoiced the morn. But he, that man late blind, the child of Rome, What heart was his? That world, his own once more, Seemed less the earth we tread, our ancient home, Than pledge of worlds to be! That sword, of yore Barrier 'twixt man and Eden, was withdrawn: Beyond there lay some new Creation's dawn. Old songs he heard, sung by his Hebrew nurse: ‘God stands around our Salem like the hills: His light is Truth: He made the Universe: Like the sea-chambers are His oracles: Who shall ascend His Holy Mountain? They Whose eye is single; undefiled their way.’ On that vivific Vision long he gazed; Then, shivering, sank upon his face, with eyes That sought once more the darkness, splendour-dazed, Still as some creature bound for sacrifice. Wondering those children stood. He rose at last And spake: ‘A Task is mine. The Past is past.’ To Cæsarea straight his steps he turned: Near it a throng came forth to greet him! They Who sinned like him that sin to expiate burned: The madness of a life-time, not a day That hour had left them! To themselves restored Self they renounced, and found, instead, their Lord. They stood with countenance glad, yet wonder-stricken, Like face of one who some great sight hath seen And still, with heart whose pulses ever quicken, Seeing no more, fronts the remembered sheen. Silent they stood, their eager eyes wide bent On him, with hands forth held in wonderment. With him returned they to their ancient city: A light till then unseen upon it shone; Christ they confessed: they sought nor praise nor pity: Sharp was the conflict; the reward soon won: The ‘Martyrs' Mound’ holds still their hallowed dust: Their spirits abide with Him in Whom they placed their trust. Farewell, Longinus! Thou one hour didst seem Of all mankind, save one, unhappy most, Yet lived'st, to vanquish fiends, from death redeem Not one poor sinner but a sinful host; Pray well for men sin-tempted to despair: Lift up thy spear and chase the fiends their Souls that scare! THE LEGEND OF SAINT PANCRATIUS. (DIED A.D. 287.) PART I. ARGUMENT. Saint Pancratius was born in Phrygia, and after the death of his parents abode with his grandfather in an ancient house outside Rome. The Diocletian persecution raging at that time, Pope Cornelius with many of the Faithful lay concealed in a catacomb, and converted to the Faith first the youth, and afterwards his grandfather. Pancratius, then fourteen years of age, was dragged before Diocletian, who required him to sacrifice to the gods. The youth scorned that command, denouncing the pagan gods. He died with great gladness outside the city wall, and Concavilla, the wife of a Roman senator, interred his body honourably nigh to the Aurelian Gate, which, having been later dedicated to the Saint, is still called the Gate of Saint Pancratius. The child Pancratius, blithesome as a bird, Glorious of countenance and of heart undaunted Abode in Phrygia. He had never heard His ancient race by friend or minstrel vaunted: How 'scaped he flattery?—thus: though great at Rome, His sire had lived since youth remote from home. That sire, Cledonius, had no heart for things Whereof the dull and brainless make their boast, Huge halls with tapestries hung, the gift of kings, The unceasing revel and the menial host: ‘Here,’ said he, ‘all is base: I seek some clime By genius graced, or hallowed by old time.’ He sailed to Athens; beauteous as a dream Her fortress-steep and temples met his eye, Ilyssus, and Colonos, Academe: Eastward he passed; great Sunium's sea-cliff nigh, He hailed that fane world-famous; from its steep Revered its reflex in the violet deep. In turn he visited the Cyclades; At Delos slumbered 'neath the laurel shade; Coasted the Asian shores; where'er the breeze At random wafted him his dwelling made, Headed the natives both in sports and jars; Now judged the prize; now led them in their wars. His was a soaring yet a careless nature, Winged with high impulse, scant in self-control: Nature he loved in every form and feature, And Art, when Art expressed or strength or soul; Loved battles most, and still, whate'er betide, Sustained the juster, spurned the ignobler side. One morn, sole wandering in a Phrygian wood, He met the loveliest lady of that land With maidens girt. At once her grace he sued And from the King, her father, won her hand, Quelling his foes. Within that realm in joy They dwelt; and there she bore her lord a boy. The years went by, and each endeared yet more The growing youth to those who knew him well; He joyed to tame the horse, to chase the boar; Foremost he raced o'er Taurus, crag and fell, Farthest his arrow launched, spake truth, and clave Swiftliest, where Iris seaward swept, the wave. One morn his father took him by the hand: ‘My son,’ he said, ‘should ill befall thy sire, Weep not o'er-long, but reverence his command: Thy mother guard; with her to Rome retire: There dwells thy grandsire, now grown old and grey; I owe to him a debt which thou must pay. ‘I left him though I loved: not anywhere Found I that prize I sought o'er all the earth: What if I lost it, leaving Rome? When there Seek it thou too! In fanes—by home or hearth— It dwells no more. Perhaps deep underground With Rome's old Sibyl it may yet be found! ‘Rome is thy place of duty: work her good! Toil for her future, mindful of her past: I left her, seeking Truth. O son, I would Some God would make it man's; for Truth will last. I sought her for her freedom, brightness, beauty: Perchance they find her best who seek but in duty. ‘I sought her long: not less myself I sought— Well, well! It needs more leisure to repent Than war-fields grant. Meantime, as parents ought, I tag with counsel my last testament: Fear none: the true man help: the false man fight; And keep the old house, not proud, yet weather-tight.’ A trumpet-blast rang out: upon his horse The brave man vaulted: from a trivial fray Ere two hours passed they bore him back a corse: The wife, the mother, met them on their way: She raised her hand: they laid him down: wide-eyed She gazed; upon his breast she sank, and died. A month went by; three miles from Rome, and more, A stately mansion shrouded in a wood Caught on its roofs the sunset. At its door Beauteous but weather-worn a stripling stood: His form showed fourteen years at most: his mien The bravest was, yet gentlest, ever seen. A crowd of slaves in raiment rich but old Led him through galleries long and many a room Spacious yet dim with walls of rusty gold To where his grandsire sat in twofold gloom, Within, of velvet hangings stifling sound, Of ilex woods without, and miles around. The boy in reverence sank upon his knees Craving a blessing. Soon was told his tale: The old man listened mute; by slow degrees He brightened like some hillside wan with hail When sudden sunbeams flash from wintry skies: And fires of days long dead were in his eyes. ‘'Tis well! A missive from my son late sent Announced your coming. You are welcome, boy! I had my wrongs, but now in part repent: Your face is like your sire's; that gives me joy: He might have lived the chiefest man in Rome: Here you shall fill his place and find your home. ‘I was too silent once in grief; in wrath Too loud. Your Father, boy, and I had words: I held my own: the young man chose his path: He passed o'er seas and lands like passage birds: I mused in this old chair nor told my pain; Yon terrace paced: the footprints still remain.’ Next morn the old man called from far and near The slaves that served his house or delved his lands And bade them in that youthful guest revere Their future master. They with lifted hands Shouted applause; then bowed their necks, and sware True service to their lord and to his heir. Day after day his grandsire gladdened more Gazing upon that boy: with honest pride He clothed him in the garb young nobles wore When he himself was young, and bade him ride His stubborn'st steed. ‘Who rules his horse,’ he said, ‘Shall find the rule of man an art inbred.’ He gave him best instructors, Romans each: ‘Read Varro, boy, read Ennius: these were ours; Those gaudy scrolls from Hellas filched but teach That fancy-lore which saps the manlier powers: Our younger nobles scarcely know to speak: They mar Rome's tongue with babblings from the Greek.’ That grandsire to the boy was teacher best, For still his speech was not from books, but life, Life of old days in liveliest pictures dressed, Huge dangers, rapturous victories, ceaseless strife: At times his speech dealt warning, seemed to chide Some latent weakness in the boy descried. ‘A man must choose his friends; not less his foes; Welcome rough truths; abhor a flatterer's praise: He must not sail with every wind that blows, Nor, vowed to virtue, walk in fortune's ways; Nor seek contrarient Good. The knave that sues God's lesser gifts His greater doth refuse.’ Oft of old days he spake: ‘The Gracchi first Let loose dissension's plague; that plague to bind The Empire rose: it laid a hand accursed On high and low, the keen-eyed and the blind. There History ends: Ixion's wheel rolls round— So ours.’ Once more he spake with sigh profound! ‘That plague came earlier! Then when Carthage died Her Conqueror, corse on corse, above her fell; Scipio Scipio of Nasica. was prophet: loud and oft he cried, “Your rival slain, your vices will rebel; First pride; then civil strife; then sloth and greed: Compared with such worst foe were friend at need.” ‘It proved so! Till that hour, survived that awe True patriots feel, which, like the thought of death, Confirms laws civil by religious law: Carthage consumed, Rome breathed the emasculate breath Of Eastern climes; Capuan she lived since then: Cornelia was the last of Roman men. ‘The Gracchi too were men, scorned all things base, Pitied the poor, the slave: they erred through zeal: In time they might have won the conscript race: They to the popular passions made appeal: They ranged 'gainst Rome the nobles’ wrath and pride: The last they might have lured to virtue's side. ‘The nobles with Pompeius fell; with them Fell that republic theirs through virtuous might: The Gods placed next the imperial diadem On Cæsar's forehead. I deny their right! My sentence here is Cato's Causa victrix Diis placuit: Causa victa Catoni.—With the Gods, Albeit religious, here I stand at odds.’ Pancratius fixed in silent trance of thought Full on his grandsire's face those lustrous eyes Which beamed as if they ne'er had gazed on aught Less splendid than the splendour of clear skies When throned within them sits the noontide day: He spake: ‘The Gods—my grandsire, what are they?’ His grandsire then: ‘The old teaching saith that Jove Exists, and they, the rest. Our Cynics new Flout that old faith, yet never can disprove: Our Gods live ill; not less they may be true: Till speaks that greater God, the All-Wise, All-Blest, Let man await His voice, and be at rest.’ The old man never from his wood emerged; In his great Roman home refused to dwell; Yet oft of Rome he spake, and ever urged The boy he loved to learn her annals well. ‘All History there,’ he said, ‘is summed; yet all Her greatness past but aggravates her fall. ‘Son, walk in Rome, but wisely choose thy way; Seek first great Vesta's fane by Numa built: Unnoted pass those trophies of the day, Pillar or arch, that fawn on prosperous guilt: The Augustan and the Adrian Tombs to thee Be what crowned upstarts, when they die, must be. ‘Hold thou no commerce with Mount Palatine; Revere the Hill Saturnian's The Capitoline Hill. templed crest; Still to Tarpeia's Rock thy brows incline, Ambition's latest leap and earliest rest: Seek last that hallowed spot where regal pride A second Brutus met, and Cæsar died. ‘Turn from that huge Pantheon's godless boast Where all Gods met became, not one, but none; That Coliseum by a captive host Ill-raised, the ill-omened vaunt of deeds ill-done. Trample such memories! To thy bosom fold— In them high mysteries lurk—our records old. ‘Romulus, that Sword of Mars, as warrior reigned; Numa as priest. He served the Unnamed, the Unknown: If lesser Powers be honoured, he ordained They should have image none in hue or stone. He built the “Fecials' House:” until they swore “This Cause is just,” Rome dared not march to war. ‘Like Indian sage he lived: his thoughts were tuned— His laws—to mystic strains beyond the skies; One law was this: “Vintage of vine unpruned Use not, 'twere sacrilege, in sacrifice:” That meant, Religion shorn of Self-restraint Insults the God; not worship, but a feint. ‘The great Republic honoured still the Kings: Long stood their statues on the Capitol: From Kings our noblest Houses came: great things Thus live though dead, while centuries onward roll. Boy! he who for the present spurns the past Shall reap no future while the world doth last. ‘True men were honoured then, or poor or rich: Peace made, the conqueror tilled anew his farm: Order was friend to Freedom: each in each They lived; and each its rival kept from harm: Sages gave counsel: heroes held command:— What now? The hard heart, and the silken hand! ‘Strong thinkers ruled—not chosen for bribe or boast; Far-seeing, serious men of silent power; Those who the Senate's pride denounced the most Invoked that Senate still in danger's hour; They knew the old tree anchors on deepest root; Swings safest in the gale; bears amplest fruit. ‘Rome had her poets, too: their work is done: Her earlier history lives alone in verse: The perils gladly braved, the triumphs won, The songs alone were worthy to rehearse: Not much the songs loved us; but them we prized: In them the people's voice grew harmonized. ‘Those songs were sung the banquet-hall to charm: Coriolanus lived once more in them; In them Virginius raised that conquering arm; In them King Tarquin's starry diadem Fell to the earth; Camillus spurned the Gaul; Attilius passed to death at duty's call. ‘To these we owe our best. Livius from these Flung fire upon his many-coloured page: From them, the Aphroditè of new seas, Rome's Latïan Muse had risen some later age: Our Civil Wars trampled that hope in blood: The Empire came, and choked the old blood in mud. ‘Then Maro piped, and Flaccus: Rome turned Greek: Barbaric now she turns, gloom lost in gloom: My buried Rome if any care to seek, Boy! let him seek it in the Scipios' Tomb! Enough! My song is sung, and said my say:— Numa his best Muse named his “Tacita.”’ He rose: he gazed on that long cloud which barred, Its crest alone still red, that dusking west: At last he turned; with breath all thick and hard He spake, his white head drooping t'ward his breast, ‘'Twas not her pangs, her shames, that tried me most; I thought of all Rome might have been—and lost.’ That night beside a cabinet he stood Musing; unlocked it next with carefulness; Last, from a perfumed box of citron-wood Drew slowly forth a lithe and golden tress; Slowly he placed it in his grandson's hold: Your father's hair—cut off at three years old.’PART II. Pancratius' grandsire left him ever free: ‘If good the heart,’ the man was wont to say, ‘Feed it with lore, but leave it liberty; The good, wise heart will learn to choose its way: Virtue means courage: man must dare and do: Who does the Right shall find at last the True.’ The boy, though gay, was studious; swift to learn, To him the acquest of knowledge was delight, For his the sacred instinct to discern How high true Knowledge wings the Spirit's flight. The youth of Rome no comrades were for him: Triflers he deemed them, fooled by jest and whim. Often on that great plain which circles Rome He spurred his steed Numidian; oftener far In that huge wood which girt his lonely home Sat solitary, while the morning star Levelled along some dewy lawn its beam, Or flashed remote on Tiber's tremulous stream. Pacing its glades at times, he seemed to hear Music till then unknown, a mystic strain That sank or swelled alternate on his ear Like long, smooth billows of some windless main. ‘Is this a dream?’ he mused; ‘if not, this wood Houses some Spirit kind to man and good.’ One day he sat there, sad. The year before That self-same day his parents both had died. ‘Where are they now? Upon what distant shore Walk they this hour?’ For them, not self, he sighed. ‘They have not changed to clay; they live: they must: But where, and how, I know not. Let me trust! ‘What loyal love maintained they each for each! With what bright courage met they peril's hour! How just their acts, how kind and true their speech! They never drave the outcast from their bower: Some great belief they must have held! In whom? Believe I will! My altar is their tomb.’ Wearied with grief, the orphan sank asleep, And, sleeping, dreamed. In dream once more he heard That mystic music sweeter and more deep Than e'er before; and now and then a word Reached him, he deemed from shadowy realms beneath: At times that word was ‘Life;’ at times 'twas ‘Death.’ Then, o'er the sheddings which the west wind's fan Had strewn beneath the pine-woods, he was 'ware That steps anear him drew; and lo! a man Beside him stood. The sunset touched his hair Snow-white, down-streaming from that reverend head, And on his staff cross-crowned a splendour shed. The dream dissolved: upright he sat, awake: The Apostolic Sire of Christian Rome Beside him stood—Cornelius: thus he spake: ‘Fear naught! I come to lead a wanderer home: Thou mourn'st thine earthly parents. They are nigh More than in life, though throned in yonder sky. ‘God's angel brought to each in life's last hour That Truth they sought, both for their sake and thine: They left thee in the flesh: since then in power With love once human only, now divine, Have tracked thy wandering steps: this day, O boy, Through me they send thee tidings of great joy. ‘That God who made the worlds at last hath spoken: The shadows melt: the dawn of Truth begins; That Saviour God the captive's chain hath broken; Reigns o'er the free: our tyrants were our Sins: He reigns Who rose, that God for man Who died, Reigns from the Cross, and rules—the Crucified.’ He told him all. As when within the East The ascended sun is glassed in seas below So that high Truth with light that still increased Lit in the listener's mind a kindred glow Because that mind was loving, calm, and pure With courage to believe and to endure. In blank astonishment he stood at first, By Truth's strong beam though raptured yet halfdazed: As when upon the eyes of angels burst Creation new created, so he gazed: He questioned; but his questions all were wise: Therefore that Truth he sought became his prize. Later he mused; then spake: ‘Whilst yet a child Something I heard—my memory is not clear— Of Christ, and her, His mother undefiled: Alas! it sank no deeper than mine ear. An old nurse whispered me that tale. Ere long She died, some said, for God. Her heart was strong.’ An hour gone by, Pancratius made demand, ‘That heavenly music, came it from above?’ Cornelius then: ‘The persecutor's brand Rages against us: not from fear but love, Love of Christ's poor—the weak, the babe—we hide: If found we die: to seek our death were pride. ‘Men scoff at us as dwellers 'mid the tombs: Beneath your grandsire's woods, till late untrod, Extends the largest of the Catacombs: There dwells the Christian Church, and sings to God: Our hymns betray us oft. Descending, thou One day wilt hear them—When?’ He answered: ‘Now.’ That twain in silence passed to where the mouth Of those dread caverns yawned; they stooped beneath; Instant upon them fell that heat and drouth Which Nubian sands o'er wayworn pilgrims breathe: Red torches glared the winding ways among; To roofs low-arched the lingering anthems clung. Their latest echo dies: the Lector reads, Then speaks: plain, brief, and strong is his discourse: ‘Brothers! each day ye know some martyr bleeds; What then? Does any fear that fleshly force Can slay the soul? God lives that soul within, And God is Life. Death dwelleth but with sin.’ That eve Pancratius mused: ‘'Mid yonder vaults God's servants live in love, and peaceful cheer: Who rules in Rome? There Vice her crown exalts Shameless yet sad; beside her, Jest and Fear. That Lector told us of a shepherd boy, The sling, the stone.’ That night was full of joy. Then with a solace never his before His thoughts reverted to his parents dead; ‘That Truth,’ he said, ‘they sought, yet missed, of yore, Is theirs this hour: its crown is on their head; Its sword within their hand. That Christ whom we Discern through mist they in God's glory see. ‘Thank Heaven, my grandsire lives!’ Straight to his ear He brought his tale. Upon that Roman's brow Hung thunder-cloud: the thing supremely dear To him were these, Reverence and Rule; and now A boy, a child that daily ate his bread, Had heaped dishonour on his hoary head. ‘Renounce thy madness, boy, or hence this day!’ Pancratius answered, with that winning smile Dear to the sad man's heart, ‘Not so: I stay! There cometh one your anger to beguile: I told him you were good: thus answered he, “Good-will means Faith: the Truth shall set him free.”’ Thus as he spake the mitred Sire of Rome, Without disguise, his pastoral staff in hand, Entered: ‘I seek, great sir, your ancient home, By you unbidden, at this youth's command: If this molests you, you can have my head: The law proscribes, the Emperor wills me dead.’ Silent the Roman noble sat: anon A glance on that strange guest at random thrown Wrought in him change: then first he looked on one Of presence more majestic than his own. ‘Cornelius is your name; unless I err. Yours is that ancient stock Cornelian, sir. ‘Within this mansion I abide recluse; I with the Emperor slight acquaintance boast, None with his court. Such things may have their use; They pass us quickly. As becomes a host All guests alike I honour, old or new; I war on no man, but converse with few. ‘Perhaps you come with tidings: if from me Aught you require, speak briefly, without art.’ Cornelius smiled, then answered placidly, ‘To each the self-same tidings I impart: Beside your house a gold-mine lurks; with you Remains to sink your shaft or miss your due.’ Courteous that Roman bowed, yet scarcely listened; Ere long he gave attention: by degrees The strong, imperious eye now flashed, now glistened; Point after point he seemed in turn to seize. He proffered question none; he spake no word, In mind collected, but in spirit stirred. Lo! as some statued form of art antique, Solon or Plato, sits with brow hand-propt And eyes the centre of the earth that seek, So sat he, when that strain majestic stopt, In silence long. He raised his eyes, and then Spake thus alone: ‘In three days come again.’ Three days went by; in that dim room once more Cornelius spake: inly Pancratius prayed; The old man listened mute. His message o'er, The Venerable Sign the Pontiff made Above that low-bent forehead. With it grace Fell from on high and lit that hoary face. Then questioned thus that man severe and grave: ‘What was the birthplace of this Creed decried Which in all lands attracts the meek and brave?’ To whom the Roman Pontiff thus replied: ‘Judah—not Greece! Fishers, not Seers, went forth; They preached that Creed, and died to prove its worth.’ His host: ‘This Faith is then at least no dream— A dream, albeit perchance of dreams the best In youth I deemed it, and dismissed the theme: Pity 'tis new! 'Tis Time doth Truth attest.’ The answer came: ‘This Faith is old as man: “The Woman's Seed.” It ends as it began. ‘This is that Faith which over-soars the sage Yet condescends to him, the peasant boy: This is that Hope which brightest shines in age All others quenched: this is that Love, that Joy, Which all retrieves; to patriots worn that cries “Thy great, true Country waits thee in yon skies.”’ The Roman next: ‘The Creeds of ages past Lived long; yet most have died; the rest wax old: Yours is the amplest: it will prove the last: For he who, having clasped it, slips his hold Shall find none other. Of the seas of Time This is high-water mark, stamped on the cliffs sublime. ‘Not less that question, “Is it true?” recurs. What Virtue is, by virtuous life is shown: She lights the paths she walks on; no man errs Who treads them. Would that Truth might thus be known! Sir, I must ponder these things. Agèd men Perforce are slow. In ten days come again.’ In ten days more that Christian priest returned: The Roman noble met him at the door, But altered. ‘You are welcome! I have yearned To see your face and hear again your lore. At times I grasp it tight: but I am old: Close-clutched it slides like sand from out my hold. ‘Mark well yon Sabine and yon Alban ranges! The north wind blows; clear shineth each ravine: Thus clear stands out your Creed; the north wind changes; The clouds rush in, and vapours shroud the scene: Thus dims more late that Creed. My end draws nigh: Honest it were Truth's Confessor to die.’ Cornelius answered, ‘Sir, not flesh and blood But God's own Finger wrote one sacred word Upon your heart when by you first I stood: That word was “Christ.” Brave man! In this you erred, Not seeking then and there that conquering light Which shines, like sunrise, on the baptism rite.’ Hour after hour, and far into the morn, Those two conversed of God. That saintly sage Witnessed, nor argued. ‘Truth,’ he said, ‘is born Alike in heart of childhood and of age, A spirit-birth. Invoke that Spirit Divine And all His lore immortal shall be thine.’ To all demands he made the same reply: Within that old man's breast—by slow degrees Stirred like Bethesda's waters tremulously— God's Truths put on God's splendour. ‘Men like trees Walking,’ in mist at first such seemed they; then They trod the earth like angels, not like men. Sudden that old man rose; he cried, ‘I see! Thank God! The scales are fallen from mine eyes! I see that Infant on His Mother's knee, That Saviour on His Cross, man's Sacrifice. It could not but be thus! From heaven to earth That Cross fills all; all else is nothing worth!’ At sunrise he received baptismal grace; And ever from that hour its radiance glowed A better sunrise on his wrinkled face, For all his heart with gladness overflowed, And childhood's innocence returned; and all His childhood loved seemed near him at his call. Once more the aspirations of his youth About him waved their pinions; by his side Now better known than when her nuptial truth To him she pledged, beside him walked his bride; And to that love he bore his Land returned That hope, long quenched, wherewith it once had burned. Still as of old his country's past he praised: ‘Numa revered one God; no idols crowned; Two altars—holy were they both—he raised; One was for Terminus who guards the Bound; One was for Faithfulness who keeps the Pledge: These spurned, he taught, all rites are sacrilege. ‘A matron wronged dragged down the race of Kings; A virgin wronged hurled forth those Ten from Rome: Omen and auspice these of greater things; Of Truth reserved to make with her its home. Man needs that aid! The proof? Man lives to act; And noblest deeds are born of Faith and Fact.’ Yet, though before him ever stood the vision Of that high Truth which gives the human soul Of visible things sole mastery and fruition, More solid seemed he, and in self-control More absolute, than of old; and from his eye Looked lordlier forth its old sobriety. In him showed nothing of enthusiasm, Of thought erratic wistful for strange ways, Nothing of phrase fantastic, passion's spasm, Or self-applause masking in self-dispraise: Some things to him once great seemed now but small: In small things greatness dwelt, and God in all. Three months gone by, he freed his slaves; above That rock, the portal of that Catacomb, He raised an altar ‘To the Eternal Love’ Inscribed: more low he built his humble tomb: ‘Not far,’ he said, ‘repose God's martyrs: I, Albeit unworthy, near to them would lie.’ In one month more serene and glad he died; An hour ere death painless the old man lay, Those two that loved him watching at his side: ‘In Christ, yet not for Christ,’ they heard him say; ‘This is the sole of Faiths, for which to bleed Were wholly sage. My son had loved this Creed.’ The tidings that a noble of the old race Had spurned the old rites transpired not till that hour Which laid him in his woodland burial-place; 'Twas Diocletian's day: the Imperial power Had made decree to trample to the ground God's Church. A worthy victim it had found. For when about the dead the Romans thronged Much wondering at the unwonted obsequies Nor pleased to see their old traditions wronged, Pancratius answered, ‘Christian rites are these;’ Then made proclaim to all men far and nigh, ‘My grandsire died a Christian: such am I.’ Two pagan priests to Diocletian sped:— ‘Yon man who died an atheist left an heir; Asian he is, a Christian born and bred: Shall that new Faith with Jove and Cæsar share? Usurp a Roman noble's place and pride?’ ‘Bring here that youth,’ the Emperor replied. That Emperor looked upon the Gods as those Who shared his reign. In majesty and mirth They sat enskied above the Olympian snows: The Goddess Rome, their last-born, ruled the earth; The Roman Emperor was her husband. He Partook perforce in their divinity. That Emperor was not cruel; from the height Of that imagined greatness gazing down To rule he deemed his duty as his right; The world his kingdom was, and Rome its crown: Who spurned that crown he deemed as sense-bereaven, Rebel 'gainst earth, and blasphemous 'gainst heaven. Next day at noon within his Judgment Court He sat, by all his pomp of majesty Compassed and guarded; lion-like his port; Then whispered man to man: ‘That terrible eye Without yon Lictors' axes or their rods, Will drive the renegade to his country's Gods.’ Pancratius entered—entered with a smile; Bowed to the Emperor; next to those around First East, then West. The Emperor gazed awhile On that bright countenance; knew its import; frowned: ‘A malefactor known! Yet there you stand! Young boy, be wise in time. Hold forth your hand! ‘Yon censer mark! It comes from Jove's chief fane; See next yon vase cinctured with flower-attire: Lift from that vase its smallest incense-grain; Commit it softly to yon censer's fire: Your father, boy, was well with me; and I Would rather serve his son than bid him die.’ Pancratius mused a moment, then began: ‘Emperor, 'tis true I am a boy; no more: But One within me changes boy to man, Christ, God and Man, that Lord the just adore. A pictured lion hangs above thy head: Say, can a picture touch man's heart with dread? ‘Thou, too, great Emperor, are but pictured life: He only lives who quickens life in all: Men are but shadows: in a futile strife They chase each other on a sun-bright wall. Shadows are they the hosts that round thee throng; Shadows their swords that vindicate this wrong. ‘What Gods are those thou bidst me serve and praise? Adulterers, murderers, Gods of fraud and theft. If slave of thine walked faithful to their ways What were his sentence? Eyes of light bereft; The scourge, the rope! Our God is Good. His Name Paints on His servant's face no flush of shame.’ The Emperor shook: as one demon-possessed He glared upon that youth; his wan cheek burned: With wonder dumb panted his struggling breast: Silent to that Prætorian Guard he turned; He pointed to Pancratius. ‘Let him die!’ Pancratius stood, and pointed to the sky. That night a corse beside the Aurelian Way Lay as in sleep. Hard by, two maidens fair Now knelt and lifted high their hands to pray, Now bent and kissed his cheek and smoothed his hair: Two daughters of a Roman matron these: A grove not far shook, moonlit, in the breeze. O fair young love—for when could love show fairer? O maids, should earthly love e'er house with you, With love thus heavenly may that love be sharer; Like this be cleansing, hallowing, self-less, true! Thou too, O boy, love's guerdon hast not missed Though young, by lips so pure so kindly kissed. A youth he lay of fourteen years in seeming; A lily by the tempest bent, not broken: Round the lashed lids a smile divine was gleaming; And if that mouth, so placid, could have spoken Plainly its speech had been: ‘Thank Heaven, 'tis past! The secret of the skies is mine at last.’ Softly those maidens with their mother bore Pancratius to that grove, and made his grave: O'er his light limbs the radiant scarfs they wore Softly they spread. Such wreaths as grace the brave On him they strewed next morn, and buds of balm; And by that grave planted the martyr's palm. Near it the Roman Walls ascend, and Gate Aurelian called of old, Pancratian now, Honouring that youth who smiling met his fate So soon, so gladly kept his baptism vow. King Numa's ‘Faithfulness’ in him was found; Therefore old ‘Terminus’ guards still that bound. Some say that when that Gate to him was given A mystery therein was signified: Earth hath her ‘Holy City;’ but in heaven A holier waits us: one that aye shall bide: Twelve gates it hath: each boasts high trust and fief: The Gate of Martyrdom of these is chief. Yea, and the Martyr is himself a gate, Since through the fiery ether of his prayer Which Vision blest kindles and doth dilate Who strives for heaven finds help to enter there. O Martyr young, by Death made glad and free, In Death's dread hour pray well for mine and me! THE LEGEND OF SAINT DOROTHEA. (DIED A.D. 287.) ARGUMENT. Saint Dorothea on the death of her parents is reared a Christian by her nurse, near Cæsarea. Fabricius, its Præfect, desires to marry her; but she has vowed to belong wholly to Christ. The Præfect throws her into prison as a despiser of the Gods. He sends to her two sisters, beautiful but of evil life, who in their youth had abandoned the Faith, and promises them much gold if they can induce her to apostatize. They are themselves won back by Dorothea, and die martyrs. She is then sentenced to death. On her way to the place of execution, a certain youth derides her, promising to become a Christian if on entering heaven she sends him flowers and fruits, the ground being then covered with snow. She sends them. The youth keeps his word, and dies for Christ. In Cappadocia, close to Cæsarea A babe was born beneath a star benign, A star whose light was laughter, Dorothea, The last, best offspring of an ancient line: That name her parents gave her, for they said, ‘She is God's gift: God's pathways she shall tread.’ As spreads some water-lily on a river, Whitening the dark wave in some shady nook, So grew that babe in beauty, winning ever A grace more winsome and more beaming look: The Pagans as they passed her stood and gazed: The Christians blessed her and her Maker praised. At three years old a spirit of peace and gladness She moved: whoever passed her all that day Forgat all fretful spleen or wayward sadness: Shy creatures shunned not her: the birds, men say, Would perch, as in green woods she took her stand, One on her shoulder, one upon her hand. Her parents gloried in her more and more: Prosperous for years, their cup was brimmed at last— Frail lot of man! A sudden storm of war Broke on the land. Domestic traitors massed With alien hordes to ruin changed that wrong: Dire was the conflict; but it dured not long. Brave hearts and true! While hope remained they fought; When treason triumphed they nor wept nor sighed: They said, ‘The worst is come; and worst is nought:’— They faced the desert: fever-struck they died: Where Plantains shadow Melas' watery bed Her nurse concealed their orphan's shining head. That nurse had saved a casket jewel-laden: It kept the twain from hunger. Day by day She bound with pearls the dark hair of the maiden, Then bade her join that region's babes at play. Ere long the pearls were sold: all debts were paid: That old nurse treasured still the crimson braid. She told her nursling of her parents' greatness Mindful that childhood's memories soon depart; Their strength, their state, in danger their sedateness, In peace their help to all and generous heart: ‘Be sure that thousands weep, this day, their fall! The knaves who wrought it, doubtless most of all.’ She told her of their palace in the mountains, Their stag-hunts, and their bugles on the wind, Their gardens flushed with flowers and dinned with fountains, Their galleries long with page and menial lined: Pages and menials to the girl were nought; Each name of garden flower, and fruit she sought. But other themes, and loftier far than these, That nurse discoursed on. ‘Kneel, my child, and pray! What music, think'st thou, were those lullabies Thy mother sang above thy cot? Each day While sinks the sun the self-same songs are sung In yon low church those Plantains old among.’ Thenceforth to that low church in woodlands hidden The child went oft through skirting willows grey On Melas' bank. Fearless, though guest unbidden, She knelt; prayed well, though taught by none to pray: The prayer came to her as to birds their song: Soon learned she more from Nuns who dwelt those trees among. Things wondrous most to Dorothea seemed Easiest of Faith. That God should be All-Wise, All-Good, All-Great, such Truth upon her beamed With rapture always; never with surprise; The pettiness of life, man's hate, his pride— These things surprised her: noting these she sighed. Whate'er held in it nought of fair and true Like wind passed by her. Lovely things and fair Once noted never bade the girl adieu; Far down into her heart they made repair, And there, awaiting wings, in trance of bliss Kept sleeping watch like silk-sheathed chrysalis. At times some act in woodland beast or bird Thus sealed within her bosom, sudden waking, Would flash a gleam upon the Preacher's word As when the dawn through cleft of cloud-land breaking Illumes a distant stream. Half thought, half sense, Some new Truth then fired her intelligence. Shapes outward thus to heavenly meanings mated, The world became to her, now maiden grown, A world transformed, and transubstantiated: A Mountain of Transfiguration shone Around her, wide as earth; and far and near Still heard she, ‘It is good to tarry here.’ None knew how wise she was; for still with her Each Truth, when mastered, changed from Thought to Love By alchemy divine. An atmosphere Of loving Faith thus wrapped her from above: All helpful tasks her hands enjoyed as much As though a lute responded to their touch. Those holy Nuns in their Scriptorium small Treasured some sacred scrolls: of these was one Most prized, most honoured, most beloved of all, The Tidings Good and Letters of Saint John: Upon that scroll by day the maiden fed: And when the moonbeams lit her pallet bed. Trial came soon. Within the neighbouring city Fabricius dwelt, its Præfect. Impious love He felt for her; a love that knew not pity: His vows she deemed but jest: later he strove To win her for his wife, yet strove in vain: One time she answered—'twas not in disdain— ‘I am a Prince's Bride. In heaven—unseen— He dwells: I join Him but through gates of death: Yet happier am I than earth's proudest queen, Since exiles too may serve that Prince, each breath Each thought, each act of spirit, or heart, or hand Be bride's obedience to her Lord's command.’ Frowning the Præfect spoke: ‘A dreamer! fie! A Nympholept subdued by magic spell! That Bridegroom-Prince you boast beyond the sky Exists not: there our great Olympians dwell.’ She smiled: ‘Each morning from His gardens He Three apples sends to me, and roses three.’ Some say she spake as children speak who glory To toss in sunshine words but used in jest: Some say she taught mysteries in allegory, Banquets of Souls and triumphs of the Blest: Some think she told a simple truth, nor knew 'Twas wondrous more than that blue heavens are blue. Not far, as gaily thus that bright one spake, There stood a youth, Theophilus by name, Who lived but tales to tell and jests to make: Some swore he earned his dinner by the same: Yet others thought him sad, and that he went To feast to drown dark thoughts in merriment. ‘Lady,’ he said, ‘I grant that flower and fruit Beseem such beauty: yet, if guess were mine, I deem that, sweetened more by lyre or lute Such gifts are likelier laid upon such shrine By some pale youth that haunts yon Plantain grove Than winged from heaven by cloud-compelling Jove.’ The smile had vanished from her young, fair face: There reigned, instead, great sadness—nought beside— No touch of anger. Mute she stood a space; Then, looking at him sweetly, thus replied; ‘You scoff: when died your mother long ago You wept: more noble are you than you know.’ That year the Decian Persecution raged Against God's Church. To attest at Rome his zeal Fiercelier than all beside Fabricius waged That war: ere long, wounded self-love to heal, He sent, in vengeance for rejected vows, To dungeon vaults whom late he sought for spouse. Next day two sisters, beauteous but ill-famed, Who, years before, had left the Christian fold, Christea and Calista they were named, He sped to her. ‘Rich jewels and much gold Shall be your meed; but first yon proud one draw To serve our Gods, and spurn her Christian Law.’ They went: she welcomed them: with speeches fair They praised the vanities of earthly life, Its pleasures and its pomps; and bade her spare Her youth, unfit to meet the ensanguined knife, The rack, the flame. She sat in silence long; Then rose like one inspired advanced and flung Round them her arms. At last with many a tear Showering the chaplets on each festive head She spake: ‘Ah me, sisters unknown, yet dear! Are ye not orphans? Are your parents dead? Remains no friend to help you? None to say, “Repent the past! Rejoice some future day!” ‘O by the memory of your spotless youth, You said 'twas Christian; by those happy years When strong ye walked in simpleness and truth Perhaps the wonder of your gamesome peers, By all the tears shed o'er some first, small sin— 'Tis not too late—your better life begin! ‘Perhaps they brought you up in ways too soft And, sorely tried, you feared for Christ to die: And yet for you He died! He lives! Full oft, Chiefly in saddest hours, He standeth nigh: He woos you to that peace whereof bereft Ye pine. Ye left Him: you He never left.’ Heart-pierced those sinners stood in mute amaze, For they heart-sore full many a wasted year Had walked in flattered sin's forlornest ways Yet never loving voice had reached their ear: A love from interest free, unsmirched by sense, Was strange. They knew not what it was nor whence. Again she spake: remembrance of a time In which the spirit watched, the body slept, Came back to them; when, tender yet sublime A breeze from heaven through all their being swept: Again it blew, for Love that conquers death Had wakened Hope. By both awakened, Faith New-born from dark emerged like sun from ocean In climes where Day treads close on skirts of Night: Torn was each heart with wildly mixed emotion: That sun was red and threatening, yet 'twas bright: The Saint a cross drew slowly from her breast: They kissed it; with her wept; and were at rest. In two weeks more misgiving had departed: Old truths, now learned anew, they learned to feel: Then came what comes alone to those deep-hearted, That high and glad ‘revenge’ of loving zeal: They sought their judge: that Faith by them denied In girlhood they confessed, and martyrs died. Next day the Præfect sentenced to the sword That maid who to their royal Shepherd, Christ, Those wanderers from His sheepfold had restored; What Christians name ‘restored’ he named ‘enticed.’ Silent she heard: serene to death she passed: Throngs girt her round, some weeping, all aghast. Then many a time neighbour to neighbour spake, ‘Is not this maid the same whom, two weeks since, Our Præfect bound with chains her will to break And wrest her, recreant, from her heavenly Prince? I stood close by when thus Fabricius said, “A cell the darkest; and your blackest bread.” ‘Yet not like face of faster is her face, But like some bride radiant with gladsome life; And o'er the ways snow-cumbered she doth pace Like youths to fields of honourable strife Where victory waits their country! Mark that eye! What sees it regioned in yon cheerless sky?’ Half-way between the prison and place of doom The Præfect's palace frowned. Beside its door Theophilus stood. No touch of pity or gloom That rueful day his mobile countenance bore. ‘Lady, 'twas June when last we met—Remember! 'Tis now your frosty feast in late December. ‘That June I said your flowers and fruits were sent Not by a heavenly but a human lover, Not one that thunders in the firmament But one who pipes in yonder Plantain cover: He'll send you none this day: for leagues the snow Cumbers the earth: for months no bud will blow. ‘Doubtless a God even now from heaven might send them: If sent, those amorous trophies speed to me! What Christians call good fortune will attend them: Thenceforth your Master's follower I will be!’ She passed; looked back; stood mute; then smiling still That smile he knew, nodded, and said, ‘I will.’ She reached the spot. Lo, where in snowy vest Stands the pure victim, modest, shy, yet still, While two old crones from throat to vestal breast Draw its warm fold that so with practised skill The headsman grey, though failing now in sight, May note his mark and plant his stroke aright. Then came, the Legend saith, from heaven a Sign: For, while the raised sword flashed before her eyes, O'er her an Angel hung, a Child divine On purple wings starred like the midnight skies— ‘From Him thou lovest, these.’ She answered thus; ‘Not mine! I sought them for Theophilus.’ That moment at the Præfect's festal board That mocker sat, and in his airiest mood, When lo, between him and the banquet's lord A beauteous Child lifting a casket stood. Sweet-voiced he spake—yet they that heard him feared— ‘From Dorothea these,’ and disappeared. Theophilus clasped that casket, ill at ease The Præfect oped it. Lo, three apples golden That waxed in radiance till by slow degrees The unnumbered torches round the board highholden Were lost therein. That great hall shone more bright Than heaven when August's sun has scaled its height. Next from that casket forth he drew three roses: The scent thereof that palace filled as when The dawn-mist raised, some blossoming vale discloses A world of flowers; and all the wind-swept glen Grows satiate with the sweets that o'er it stream Seaward, dissolving in the matin beam. Long time that night through alley, court, and street The Præfect's guard that Child all-beauteous sought Despite the wildering snow and wounding sleet; Sought him to slay him: when they found him not, The courtiers swore that marvel was but fancy; The priests, imposture mixed with necromancy. Again the revellers revelled; all save one, The last in whom till then or friend or foe Had looked for serious thought or deed well done: Propping on steadfast hand a head bent low Theophilus mused. Still in his heart he said, ‘How knew she that I loved my mother dead? ‘I hid my grief.’ At dawn o'er snow-plains frore He saw that Plantain grove and narrow field, And slowly t'ward them moved, like one in war Wounded nigh death and yet not wholly healed, And found, half hid in trees, a chapel low: Its altar-lights gold-barred the frozen snow. Its door stood open:—lo! a choir of Nuns, 'Twas Christmas morn, around a cradle kneeling Wherein an imaged Infant lay, at once To woman-instinct and to Faith appealing, The Bethlehem Babe. Low-voiced they sang a hymn; Then sought their convent nigh through vapours dim. The young man followed—questions many made Of her by them so loved; so lately dead: They wept; they smiled; that slender crimson braid Kept by her nurse, which wound the young child's head, They showed; and showed on Melas' bank that stone Whereon each morn the maid had knelt alone. Somewhat they told him of her later days; But early and late were now alike gone by, And dear things kenned through memory's farthest haze To them seemed dearer yet than dear things nigh: ‘All she became she was,’ they said, ‘even then, A Saint to Angels whilst a child to men. ‘O what a charity was hers! All night Last June for one a moment seen she prayed On yonder stone! She said, “his words were light; Yet sinners worse have oft, with God to aid, Made happy deaths.” Farewell, sir, we must go:’ He sought that stone: no more his steps were slow. There as he mused, drew near an aged Sire Who served that chapel from his cell hard by With peril to his life and not for hire: He to that questioning youth made kind reply, And showed him what that is in Christian faith Which, sweetening life, more deeply sweetens death. Feeble that old man looked; depressed his head Save when he spake: then tall he grew once more; It seemed as though his body long since dead Lived through his spirit's life, like those of yore, Salem's old Saints who, when the Saviour died, From graves close-sealed arose and prophesied. When stared that youth as one who stares through mist, Seeking lost paths, he added; ‘Love can see: 'Tis wondrous less the All-Wondrous should exist Than that, without Him, man should live, or tree. If God be Love, that God for man should bleed Is natural as that flowers should come of seed. ‘Live thou no more in thraldom! Rome was great: Her Virtue made her great: Greatness can die: Virtue's reward brings Pride; and Pride brings Fate: A maniac that declines to idiotcy Is Rome this day. Her blessing spurn: her ban! To be a Christian learn to be a man!’ Faith came at last. That mocker long abused By tricksome follies cast that bond aside: The better genius in his spirit was loosed: He kept his pledge: martyr for Christ he died: And still when Dorothea's Feast its grace Bestows, Theophilus with her hath place. I. CONSTANTINE IN THRACE. (A.D. 324.) ARGUMENT. The Emperor Constantine, the day before he reaches Byzantium, projects the building of Constantinople upon its site, esteeming that site the fittest for the metropolis of a Christian Empire, or, more properly, of a Christian Caliphate, one and universal, to be created by him. He resolves, that task completed, to be baptized; but not till then, his Belief being but a half belief. Ha, Pagan City! hast thou heard the tidings, Rome, the world's mistress, whom I never loved! Whilst yet a boy I read of thy renown, Thy Kings, thy Consuls, and thine Emperors, Thy triumphs, slow but certain, in all lands, Yet never yearned to see thy face. Thy heart Was as my heart—averse, recalcitrant. I left my charge; I clave that British sea; I crossed the snowy Alps; I burst thy chain; I drowned thy tyrant in the Tiber's wave, Maxentius, him whose foot was on thy neck: I sat lip-worshipp'd on thy Palatine Hill; But well I knew that to that heart of thine Nero's black memory was a welcomer thing Than I, a son of that Rome-bated North, For all my glories. Hast thou heard the tidings? The Cross of Christ is found! By whom? Not thee! Thou grop'st and grovel'st in the gold-stream's bed Not there where lies the Cross! I, Constantine The Unbaptized, am cleaner thrice than thou— I found it through my mother! The Cross is found! I left thee: I had heard a mighty voice: Eastward it called me: there Licinius reigned, Who made the inviolate Empire twain, not one: One crown suffices earth. Licinius fell: I saw him kneeling at his conqueror's feet I saw him seated at his conqueror's board: I spared him, but dethroned. New tumults rose: Men said they rose through him. Licinius died; 'Twas rumoured, by my hand: I never loved him: The truth came out at last: I let it be. He died: that day the Empire stood uncloven, One as in great Augustus' regal prime, One as when Trajan reigned and Adrian reigned— Great kings, though somewhat flecked with Christian blood:— Whom basest Emperors spared the best trod down; I judge them not for that: not yet had dawned That day when Faith could be the base of Empire. The Antonines came later, trivial stock, Philosophers enthroned. Philosophers! I never loved them: Life to me was teacher: That great Cæsarian Empire is gone by: 'Twas but the old Republic in a mask With Consul, Tribune, Pontiff rolled in one: A great man wrought its ruin, Diocletian: The greatest save those three who built it up: He split his realm in four. Amid the wreck What basis now subsists for permanent empire? Religion. Of Religions one remains: The rest are dead Traditions, not Religion. The old gods stand in ivory, stone, and gold Dozing above the dust-heaps round their feet: The Flamen dozes on the altar-step: The People doze within the colonnades: The Augurs pass each other with a smile: The Faith that lives is Christ's. Three hundred years The strong ones and the wise ones trod it down: Red flames but washed it clean—I noted that: This day the Christian Empire claims its own. The Christian Empire—stranger things have been; Christ called His Church a Kingdom. Such it is: The mystery of its strength is in that oneness Which heals its wounds, and keeps it self-renewed. It rises fair with order and degree, And brooks division none. That realm shall stand; I blend therewith my Empire; warp and woof These twain I intertwine. Like organism Shall raise in each a hierarchy of powers Ascending gradual to a single head, The Empire's head crowned in the Empire's Church. The West dreamed never of that realm twin-dowered With spiritual sway and temporal: the East, I think, was never long without such dream, Yet shaped not dream to substance. Persia failed: Failed when by Greek Mythology infected; Earlier, the Assyrian and the Babylonian; Colossal structures these, but scarcely noble: The Alexandrian Empire later came And more deserved to live. Not less 'twas doomed: The Conqueror lacked material; he had naught To work on save the dialectics keen And Amphionic song of ancient Greece. His dream was this—an Empire based on Mind, The large Greek Mind. Mind makes a base unstable: Large minds have ever skill to change their mind: Then comes the fabric down. He died a youth, A stripling; ay, but had his scheme been sound 'Tis likely he had lived. Religion lives. Perhaps a true Faith only could sustain A permanent Empire's burthen. Mine is true: Whoso denies its truth that man shall die. The Church had met in synod, for a man Had made division in that ‘seamless robe’ Regal this day. Arius schismatic stood For what? A doctrine! Fool! and knew he not Religion is a Law, and not a Doctrine. The Church had met in synod at Nicæa, Nicæa near Byzantium. There was I: The Church in synod sat and I within it. Flocking from every land her bishops came; They sat and I in the midst, albeit in Rome My title stood, ‘Pontifex Maximus.’ They came at my command, by me conveyed. A man astonished long I sat; I claimed To sit ‘a bishop for the things without.’ Amid those bishops some were Confessors Maimed by the fire or brand. I kissed their wounds: None said, ‘What dost thou 'mid the Prophet Race?’ They saw I honoured God, and honoured me. I, neither priest nor layman; I, that ne'er Had knelt a Catechumen in the porch, Her Emperor, yet an Emperor unbaptized, I sat in the synod. At the gates stood guards: Not all were Christian: two, the best, were bold: One from Danubius winked at me; and one From Rhenus smiled at me. The weeks went by, And in me daily swelled some spirit new: I know it now; it was the imperial spirit. When rose that contest I had willed at first The doctrine questioned should be trivial deemed, And license given, ‘think, each man, what he will.’ The fires had burned too deep for that: I changed: I sided with the strong, and kept the peace. That was my triumph's hour: then came the fall. I made return to Rome. Twelve years gone by My sword had riven the Western tyrant's chain: Since then the tyrant of the East had perished: The world was echoing with my name. I reached The gate Flaminian and the Palatine; I looked for welcome such as brides accord Their lords new-laurelled. Rome, a bride malign, Held forth her welcome in a poisoned cup: Mine Asian garb, my ceremonious court, Its trappings, titles, and heraldic gear, To her were hateful. Centuries of bonds Had left her swollen with Freedom's vacant name: A buskined greatness trampled still her stage: By law the gods reigned still. The senate sat In Jove's old temple on the Capitol: My fame Nicæan edged their hate. The priest Shouldering through grinning crowds to sacrifice Cast on me glance oblique. Fabii and Claudii Whose lives hung powerless on their Emperor's nod Eyed me as he who says, ‘This man is new.’ One festal morning to some pagan fane The whole Equestrian Order rode—their wont— In toga red. I saw, and laughing cried, ‘Better their worship than their horsemanship!’ That noon the rabble pressed me in the streets With wrong premeditate; hissed me; spat at me; That eve they brake my statues. Choice was none Save this, to drown the Roman streets in blood Or feign indifference. Scorn, twelve years of scorn— Changed suddenly to hate. A fevered night Went by, and morning dawned. My council met; Then came that fateful hour, my wreck and ruin. Aye, for the plot long brewing now was ripe; Fausta, my wife, hated her rival's son, Mine eldest born, my Crispus; hated him Most fiercely since his victory at Byzantium, Yea more than hated for his Mother's sake, The glory and the gladness of my youth By me for Empire's sake repudiated, The sweetness of whose eyes looked forth from his. Fausta but one hope nursed—to crown her sons, My second brood, portioning betwixt those three My realm when I was dead. My brothers holp her plot. She watched her time: She waited till the eclipse which falls at seasons Black on our House was dealing with my soul; Then in that council-hall her minions rose; They spake; they called their witnesses suborned, Amongst them of my counsellors some the best; They brought their letters forged and spurious parchments, And made it plainer seem than sun or moon That he it was, my Crispus, Portia's child, Who, whilst his sire was absent at Nicæa, Month after month had plotted 'gainst him, made His parricidal covenant with Rome: The father was to fall in civil broil, Her son to reign. Their league the day gone by When that mad tumult in the streets assailed me, Had made its first assay. That hour the Fates Around me spread their net: that hour the chains Of Œdipus were tangled round my feet: I stood among them blind. Such blindness fell Upon me twice before. The noontide flamed: I, in full council sitting—I since youth A man of marble nerve and iron will, A man in whom wild fancy's dreams alike And fleshly lusts had held no part, subdued By that Religion grave, a great Ambition; I self-controlled, continent in hate itself, Deliberate and foreseeing—I that hour Down on that judgment-parchment pressed my seal: That was my crime, the greatest earth has known; My life's one crime. I never wrought another. 'Twas rage pent up 'gainst her I could not strike, Rome, hated Rome! I smote her through my son, Her hope, the partner of her guilt. That night My purpose I repented. 'Twas too late: The ship had sailed for Pola. Tempest dire, By demons raised, brake forth: pursuit was vain. Within his Istrian dungeon Crispus died. I willed that he, but not his fame, should perish; Therefore that deed was hid. With brow sun-bright, Hell in my heart, I took my place at feasts: At last the deed was blabbed. My mother loved— My mother, Helena, the earth's revered one, Cybéle of the Christians termed by Greeks— Loved well my Crispus for his mother's sake, Wronged, like herself, by royal nuptials new, And hated Fausta with her younger brood. She brake upon my presence like a storm: With dreadful eyes and hands upraised she banned me: She came once more, that time with manifest proof Of Fausta's guilt. The courtiers not denied it; My brothers later; last the Accursed herself Confessed it; nay she made thereof her boast. Two days I sat in darkness: on the third I sent to judgment Fausta and her crew: That act I deem the elect of all my acts. They died: at eve I rose from the earth and ate. But fifteen months before, I at Nicæa Had sat a god below! No more of that! 'Twas false, the rumour that by night, disguised, I knelt before a pagan shrine, and sought Pagan lustration from a pagan priest, And gat for answer that for crime like mine Earth held lustration none. I built great fanes, Temples which all the ages shall revere: Saint Peter's huge Basilica; Saint John's; I roamed from each to each, like him who sought A place for penitence, and found it not; Then from that city doomed—O! to what heights I, loving not, had raised her!—forth I fared, Never thenceforth to see her. Rome has reigned: She had her thousand years. Unless some greatness Hidden from man remains for man, her doom Draws near her—dust and ashes. I went forth: I deemed the God I served had cast me off: The Pagan world I knew my foe: the Christian Thundered against me from a thousand shores: There was a dreadful purpose in my soul: It was my Mother saved me! She, keen-eyed, Discerned the crisis; kenned the sole solution. In expiation of my crime she sped A holy pilgrim to the Holy Land: She spread her hands above the sacred spot As when the Mother-Beast updrags to light The prey earth-hidden for her famished young: Instinct had led her to it: she dug and dug; She found the world's one treasure, lost till then, That Cross which saved the world. With lightning speed The tidings went abroad: I marched: last night I raised mine eyes to heaven. I ne'er was one Of spirit religious, though my life was pure, Austerely pure amid an age corrupt: I never was a man athirst for wonders; My fifty years have witnessed three alone: The first was this—while yet Maxentius lived, My army nearing Rome, I marked in her, Though bondslave long, a majesty divine; She seemed earth's sum of greatness closed in one: Some help divine I needed to confront her: That help was given: I looked aloft: I saw In heaven the God-Man on His Cross, henceforth My battle-sign, ‘Labarum.’ Yesternight Once more I saw it! He that hung thereon Spake thus: ‘Work on, and fear not.’ Those two visions, The first, the third, shine on me still as one: The second was of alien race and breed. New-throned in Rome I doubted oft her future: One night I watched upon Mount Palatine, My seat a half-wrought column. It had lain For centuries seven rejected, none knew why, By earlier builders: in more recent times Ill-omened it was deemed, yet unremoved. The murmur from the City far beneath Had closed my eyelids. Sudden by me stood A queenly Form, the Genius of great Rome; Regal her face; her brow, though crowned, was ploughed With plaits of age. She spake: ‘Attend my steps.’ Ere long I marked her footing the great sea Eastward: I followed close. Then came a change: Seven hills before me glittered in her light: Save these the world was dark. I looked again: On one of these she stood. Immortal youth Shone splendid from her face no longer furrowed; And all her form was martial. On her head She bore a helm, and in her hand a spear High-raised. She plunged that spear into the soil, And spake: ‘Build here my City and my Throne;’ Then vanished from my sight. High up I heard The winnowing of great wings. The self-same sound Had reached me while that Goddess trod the sea: 'Twas Victory following that bright crest for aye. Morn broke: I knew that site; it was Byzantium; So be it! There shall stand the second Rome, Not on the plain far-famed that once was Troy, A dream of mine in youth. Some Roman Bard In song denounced that dream: Byzantium! Ay! The site is there: there meet the double seas Of East and West. The Empire rooted there Shall stand the wide earth's centre, clasping in one— That earlier Rome was only Rome rehearsed— The Alexandrian and Cæsarean worlds: Atlas and Calpé are our western bound; Ganges shall guard our Eastern. To the North Not Rhenus, not Danubius—that is past— But Vistula and far Boristhenes; And farther northern seas. Those Antonines, Boasted their sageness, limiting their realm: They spared Rome's hand to freeze her head and heart: An Empire's growth surceased, its death begins: Long death is shame prolonged. Five hundred years That last great war shall dure. Let Persia tremble! Rome's sole of Rivals! Distance shields her now: My Rome shall fix on her that eye which slays: She like a gourd shall wither. Crispus my son, That task had been for thee! Ha, Roman Nobles! Your judgment-time approaches! Shadows ye! Shadows long since are ye! Those shades shall flit: My City shall be substance, not a shadow. Ye slew the Gracchi; they shall rise and plague you: Ye clutched the Italian lands; stocked them with slaves; Then ceased the honest wars: your reign shall cease: Again, as when Fabricius left his farm To scourge his country's foes, Italian hands The hands of Latium, Umbria, and Etruria, In honourable households bred, made strong By labour on their native fields, shall fence Their mother-land from insult. Mercenaries! Who made our Roman armies mercenary? Slave-lords that drave the free men from the soil! Your mercenaries bought and sold the realm! In sport or spleen they chose Rome's Emperors! The British hosts chose me. I, barbarous styled, I Constantine decree that in the ranks Of Rome the Roman blood, once more supreme, Shall leave scant place for hirelings ill to trust; The army to the Emperor shall belong, Not he to it, henceforth. On these seven hills— The seven of Rome, with them compared, are pigmies— I build earth's Empire City. They shall lift High up the temples of the Christian Law Gold-domed, descried far off by homeward fleets, Cross-crowned in record of my victory At Rome, and Crispus' victory at Byzantium, To it shall flock those senators of Rome Their Roman brag surceased. Their gods shall stand, Grateful for incense doles diminishing daily, If so they please, thronging the lower streets, These, and the abjects of the Emperors dead;— Ay, but from those seven hills to heaven shall rise The Apostolic Statues, and mine own, Making that race beneath ridiculous, Above the Empire which that city crowns, Above its Midland, Euxine, Caspian seas, Above its Syrian Paradises lulled By soft Orontes' and Euphrates' murmurs, Above its Persian gardens, and the rush Of those five Indian rivers o'er whose marge The Man of Macedon fixed his eastward eyes, Above all these God's Angels keeping watch From East to West shall sweep, for aye sustaining My Standard, my ‘Labarum’! It shall last, That Empire, till the world herself decays, Since all the old Empires each from each devolved It blends, and marries to a Law Divine. Its throne shall rest on Right Hereditary, Not will of splenetic legions or the crowd; Its Sovereigns be the Elect of God, not man; Its nobles round their Lord shall stand, sun-clad In light from him reflected; stand in grades Hierarchal, and impersonating, each, Office and function, not the dangerous boast Of mythic deeds and lineage. Age by age Let those my Emperors that wear not names Of Cæsar or Augustus, but my name, Walk in my steps, honouring my Church aright: My Empire and My Church must dwell together The one within the other. Which in which? The Empire clasps the world; clasps then the Church; To shield that Church must rule her. Hers the gain: I, who was never son of hers, enriched her Making the ends o' the earth her heritage: I ever knew 'tis poverty not wealth That kindles knave to fanatic: silken saints Like him of Nicomedia, my Eusebius, Mate best with Empire's needs. When death draws nigh, I, that was ever jealous lest the Font Might give the Church of Christ advantage o'er me, Will humbly sue for baptism, doffing then My royal for my chrysome robe. Let those Who through the far millenniums fill my throne In this from me take pattern. Wise men choose For wisest acts wise season. Hark that trump! The army wakens from its noontide rest: Ere sunset fires its walls I reach Byzantium. II. CONSTANTINE AT CONSTANTINOPLE.(A.D. 337.) ARGUMENT. The Emperor Constantine at Constantinople, a few days before his death, revolves his past life and the failure of his design for the creation of an Imperial Church under the Emperor's sway. He calls to mind several of the causes which have forced him with his own hand to break up the boasted unity of his Empire: but he suspects also the existence of some higher and hidden cause. His career he declares to have ended in frustration; yet he suddenly deerees a new military expedition. A missive from the Persian King! Those kings! Their prayers and flatteries are more rankly base Than those of humbler flatterers. I'll not read it: Place it, Euphorbos, by yon desk. 'Tis well: The sea-wind curls its page but wafts me not Its perfumed fetor. Leave me. From the seas, The streets, the Forum, from the Hippodrome, From circus, bath, and columned portico, But chiefly from the base of that huge pillar Whereon Apollo's statue stood, now mine, Its eastern-bending head rayed round with gold— Say, dost thou grudge thy gift, Helopolis?— The multitudinous murmur spreads and grows. Wherefore? Because a life ill-spent has reached Its four-and-sixtieth year, perhaps its last. Give me that year when first I fought with beasts In Nicomedia's amphitheatre; Gallerius sent me there to slay me there: Not less he laughed to see that panther die; Laughed louder when I charged him with his crime. Give me that year when first my wife—not Fausta— That year when launching from the British shore I ceased not till my standard, my Labarum, Waved from the walls of Rome. When Troy had fallen That brave and pious exile-prince, Æneas, Presaged the site of Rome: next, Romulus Laid the first stone: Augustus laid the second: I laid the last: I would have crowned their work:— Rome from her flung me for my northern birth: Eastward I turned. Three empires to the ground I trod. My warrant! Unauthentic they: Their ruling was misrule. Huge, barbarous hosts I hurled successive back o'er frozen floods: Yet these, the labours of my sword, were naught: The brain it was that laboured. I have written The laws that bind a province in one night: Such tasks have their revenge. O for a draught Brimmed from the beaming beaker of my youth Though all Medea's poisons drugged its wave, And all the sighs by sad Cocytus heard O'er-swept its purple margin! Give me youth! At times I feel as if this total being That once o'er-strode the subject world of man, This body and soul insensibly had shrunk As shrinks the sculptor's model of wet clay In sunshine, unobserved by him who shaped it Till some chance-comer laughs— I touch once more dead times: their touch is chill: My hand is chill, my heart. I thought and wrought. No dreamer I. I never fought for fame: I strove for definite ends; for personal ends: Helpful to man and me. Sacred Religion I honoured not for mysteries occult Hid 'neath her veil, as Alexandria boasts Faithful to speculative Greece, its mother; I honoured her because with both her hands She stamps the broad seal of the Moral Law, Red with God's Blood, upon the heart of man, Teaching self-rule through rule of Law, and thus Rendering the civil rule, the politic rule A feasible emprise. My Empire made, At once I sheathed my sword. For fifteen years I, warrior-bred, maintained the world at peace. In that I erred. What came of that, my error? A realm's heart-sickness and soul-weariness, The schism of classes warring each on each And all to ruin tending, spite of cramps Bound daily round the out-swelling wall. 'Twas vain! Some Power there was that counter-worked my work With hand too swift for sight, which, crossing mine, Set warp 'gainst woof and ever with my dawn Inwove its night. What hand was that I know not: Perchance it was the Demon's of my House; A sanguinary House by breed and nurture, Perchance a Hand Divine. I had two worlds—neither was made by me— The Pagan and the Christian, glorious both— To shape and blend in one— One past her day, one nascent. Thus I mused— Old Pagan Rome vanquished ignobler lands, Then won them to herself through healing laws: Thus Christian Rome must vanquish Pagan Rome, The barbarous races next: both victories won, Thus draw them to her, vanquishing their hearts Through Law divine. What followed? Pagan Rome Hates Christian Rome for my sake daily more; Gnashes her teeth at me. ‘Who was it,’ she cries, ‘That laid the old Roman Legion prone in dust Cancelling that law which freed it from taxation? Who quelled the honest vices of the host By laws that maimed all military pride? Who hurled to earth the nobles of old race And o'er them set his titular nobles new And courtier prelates freed from tax and toll? Who ground our merchants as they grind their corn?’ False charges all; they know them to be false: The Roman legion ere my birth was dead: Those other scandals were in substance old; My laws were needfullest efforts to abate them. They failed: when once the vital powers are spent Best medicines turn to poisons. ‘God,’ 'tis writ, ‘Made curable the nations:’ Pagan Rome— Who cures the dead? To her own level Rome By equal laws had raised the conquered nations; Yea; but by vices baser far than theirs Below their level Rome had sunk herself; The hordes she lifted knew it and despised her: I came too late: the last, sole possible cure Hastened, I deem, the judgment. Diocletian Affirmed that Christians, whether true or false, At best were aliens in his scheme of empire, At worst were hostile. Oft and loud he sware That only on the old virtues, old traditions, The patriot manliness of days gone by, The fierce and fixed belief in temporal good And earthly recompense for earthly merit, Rome's Empire could find base. That Emperor erred In what he saw not. What he saw was true. I saw the old Rome was ended. What if I, Like him, have missed some Truth those Christians see? Men call that Race Baptized the illuminated. The Race Baptized! To me it gave small aid! An Empire's Faith must first be Faith in Empire: Religious Faith comes next. To me Faith came, A lightning flash, that hour when first I cried ‘My Empire's bound must be the Northern Seas’: If not, some prophet from Arabian sands, For Faith is hottest in the South, will rise And snatch my destined crown. The Race Baptized! A poor half Faith was theirs In Charity dissolved. That Sin amerced My faithful people of Faith's centre firm Round which a Universe might have hung self-poised, And barred my Northern March. The Cleric Counsel Was evermore for peace. The Imperial purpose Then first a limit knew to just Ambition:— For that cause lies beyond my hand this day In mass immeasurable that Race Barbaric Likelier perchance to absorb more late my Empire Than be in it absorbed. I missed my spring: no second chance was granted: I failed: none know it: I have known it long. My counsels still were sage; yet nothing prospered, Then dropped the strong hands baffled. Slowly, surely The weed became the inheritor of all: The tribute withered: offices of state Were starved: and from the gold crown to her feet Beneath her regal robe the Empire shrank: Fair was the face; the rest was skeleton; Dead breast; miscarrying womb. A hand not mine Had counterworked my work. In rage of shame Or seeking humblest peace at vilest cost, There were that voluntary changed to slaves! A priest made oath to me, ‘There's many a man Sir, in your realm, who gladly, while I speak, Would doff his human pride and hope immortal, And run a careless leveret of the woods Contented ne'er to see his Maker's Face Here or in worlds to come.’ Death-pale he sware it! What help? I worked with tools: my best were rotten, Some Strong One worked against me. I thought to rule my people through their Priests: The spiritual power hath passed to men their foes. Of late I made my youngest son a Cæsar: I craved for him the blessing of God's Church: I sought it not from prelates of my court: I cast from me away the imperial pride: I sent an embassage of princes twelve In long procession o'er the Egyptian sands To where within his lion-cinctured cave Sits Anthony the Hermit. Thus he answered: ‘Well dost thou, Emperor, in adoring Christ: Attend. Regard no more the things that pass: Revere what lasts, God's judgment and thy Soul: Serve God, and help His poor.’ His words meant this: ‘That work thou wouldst complete is unbegun; Begin it Infant crowned.’ Three years of toil With all earth's fleets and armies in my hand Raised up this sovereign city. Mountains cleft Sheer to the sea, and isles now sea-submerged, Surrendered all their marbles and their pines; And river-beds dried up yielded their gold To flame along the roofs of palace halls And basilics more palatial. Syrian wastes Gave up their gems; her porphyries Egypt sent; Athens and Rome their Phidian shapes eterne: My work was not in hope but in despair, I made an Empire's Picture, not an Empire: My Empire had existence, but not life: The child it was of Rome's decrepitude, Imbecile as its sire. No youth-tide swelled Its heart, or nerved its arm, or lit its eye: Its sins themselves had naught of youth within them. On Rome the shadow of great times was stayed; The shadow and the substance here alike Were absent; and the grandeur of the site But signalized its lack. To the end Rome nursed Some rock-flower virtues sown in years of freedom: Maro and Flaccus thrilled the Palatine With music of great thoughts. Pagan was Rome: Ay, but the Catacombs were under Rome, What if her one sole hope be buried there With all their Christian dead? That Rome was mine. In it alone there wagged no tongue against me, I left it for some future man;—for whom? Old Sabine Numa can he come again To list Egeria's whisper; or those priests White-robed that, throned on Alba Longa's height, Discoursed of peace to mortals? Romulus? Augustus? These have left their Rome for ever: With me they left it. Who shall be our heirs? No man—till some new Deluge sweeps it clean. Haply some barbarous race may prove that wave: Haply, that wave back-driven or re-engulfed Within some infinite ocean's breast unknown, From the cleansed soil a stem may yet ascend; A tree o'er-shade the earth. That Rome I left: I willed to raise an Empire great like Rome, And yet in spirit Rome's great opposite, What see I? Masking in a Name divine A City like to Rome but worse than Rome; A Rome with blunted sword and hollow heart, And brain that came to her second-hand, Weak, thin, worn out by one who had it first, And, having it, abused. I vowed to lift Religion's lordliest fane and amplest shrine: My work will prove a Pagan reliquary With Christian incrustations froz'n around. It moulders. To corruption it hath said, ‘My sister;’ to the wormy grave, ‘My home.’ Not less that city for a thousand years May keep its mummied mockery of rule Like forms that sleep 'neath Egypt's Pyramids Swathed round in balm and unguent, with blind eyes. That were of dooms the worst. My hope was this That that high mercy of the Christian Law Tempering the justice of the Roman Law, Might make a single Law, and bless the world: But Law is for the free man, not the slave: I look abroad o'er all the earth: what see I? One bondage, and self-willed. I never sinned As David sinned—except in blood—in blood: Was this my sin, that not like him I loved? Or this, that, sworn to raise o'er all the earth Christ's realm, I drew not to His Church's font?— To that a fatal obstacle I kenned: The Church's son could ne'er have shaped her course. Once more I sat in council at Nicæa: In honour next to mine there stood a man— I never loved that man—with piercing eye And wingèd foot whene'er he moved; till then Immovable as statue carved from rock; That man was Athanasius. Late last year A second sacred council sat at Tyre: It lifted Arius from Nicæa's ban: From Alexandria's Apostolic throne Her Patriarch, Athanasius, it deposed: Her priesthood and her people sued his pardon; He was seditious, and I exiled him: That was my last of spiritual acts. Was it well done? Arius since then hath died: Since then God's Church is cloven. I willed her One. Not less 'twas I dissolved her unity. My Empire too is cloven, and cloven in five. No choice remained. I never was the man To close my eyes against unwelcome truth. My sons, my nephews, ineffectual these! Since childhood left them I have loved them not, And late have learned that they conspire against me. No zeal parental warps my life's resolve To leave my Empire one and only one: Yet now a net is round me. To bequeath To one mid those incapables an Empire Were with the sceptre's self to break that Empire, To slay it at the moment of its birth, To raise the war-cry o'er my funeral feast, And, ere the snapt wand lay upon my grave, To utter from that grave my race's doom And yield the labour of my life a prey To Vandal and to Goth. Conviction came: It comes to all; slowliest to him who knows That Hope must flee before its face for ever: Conviction that my Empire's Unity, Must end, a dream. That Knowledge—that Conviction— It came at first a shadow, not a shape; It came again, a Phantom iron-handed: It took me by the hand from plausive hosts; It took me by the hand from senate halls; It took me by the hand from basilic shrines; It dragged me to the peak ice-cold; to depths Caverned above earth's centre. From that depth I saw no star; I heard no ‘De Profundis.’ One night, the revel past, I sat alone Musing on things to come. In sleep I heard The billow breaking 'gainst the huge sea-wall, Then backward dragged, o'erspent. For hours I mused: ‘The life of man is Action and Frustration Alternate. Both exhausted, what remains? Endurance. Night is near its term. The morn Will see my last of Acts, a parchment writ, A parchment signed and sealed.’ Sudden I heard Advancing as from all the ends of earth Tramp of huge armies to the city walls: Then silence fell. Anon my palace courts Were thronged by warring hosts from every land Headed by those disastrous Rivals Five My sons, my nephews. Long that strife rang out; First in the courts, then nearer shrieks I heard: Amid the orange-scented colonnades And inmost alabaster chambers dim; And all the marble pavements gasped in blood, And all the combatants at last lay dead: Then o'er the dead without and dead within A woman rode; one hand, far-stretched, sustained A Portent—what I guessed—beneath a veil: She dropped it at my feet: it was a Head. She spake: ‘The deed was thine: take back thine own! Bid Crispus bind in one thy shattered Empire! Son of that earlier wife—the wife well-loved.’ Then fires burst forth as though all earth were flame, And thunders rolled abroad of falling domes, And tower, and temple, and a shout o'er all, ‘The Goth, the Vandal!’ 'Twas not these that roused me; It was a voice well-loved, for years unheard, ‘Father, grieve not! That deed was never thine!’ Standing I woke, and in my hand my sword. This was no vision; 'twas a dream; no more: Next day at twelve I wrote my testament: I wrote that testament in my heart's best blood: That Empire, vaster far than those of old, That Empire long divided, late by me Consolidated, and by Christian Law Lifted to heights that touch on heaven, that Empire This hand that hour divided into five. This hand it was which wrote that testament; This hand which pressed thereon the Imperial Seal: Then too I heard those shouting crowds. Poor fools! They knew not that the labour of my life Before me stood that hour, a grinning mask Disfleshed by death. That was my Act supreme; Like Diocletian's last; 'twas abdication: How oft at his I scoffed! They scoff not less The ripples of yon glittering sea! they too Shoot out their lips against me! They recall That second crisis in my vanished years, When from this seat, Byzantium then, forth fled Vanquished Licinius. There from yonder rock, Once more I see my fleet steer up full-sailed, Glassing its standards in the Hellespont, Triumphant; see the Apostate's navy load The Asian shore with wrecks. It was my Crispus ruled my fleet that hour! That victory I saw was his, not mine: His was the heroic strength that awes mankind, The grace that wins, the majesty that rules them. Had he but lived! Well spake my dying sister Wedded to that Licinius whom I slew, ‘God for thy sins will part from thee thy realm.’ I heard that whisper as my city's walls Ascended, daily. Night by night I heard The tread of Remus by his brother slain Circling the walls half-raised of Rome. He slew His Brother only. I—Well, well! 'Tis past! In age I built a City. So did Cain. My portion in that City is yon church Named of the Apostles: there I reared my tomb: Around it rise twelve kingly cenotaphs In honour of the Twelve Apostles raised; These are my guards against the Powers Unblest: Within that circle I shall sleep secure: Thou Hermit of the Egyptian cave, be still!— Ye too be mute, O mocking throngs far off! Be mute, sweet song and adulating hymn!— What scroll is that wind-curled? Ha! Persia's missive! I ever scorned that Persia! I reject Her mendicant hand, stretched from her bed of roses; She that of Cyrus made of old her boast, That tamed the steed, and spake the truth; and rais'd The one sole possible rival of my Rome; An Empire based on God and on His Law, A mighty line of kings hereditary, And, raising, proved my work was feasible! This day she whines and fawns; one day she dragged A Roman Emperor through her realm in chains, By name Valerian. Roman none forgives her! I'll send no answer; yet I'll read her missive. ‘The Great King thus to Constantine of Rome: Galerius stole from Persia, while she slept, Five provinces Caucasian. Yield them back! If not, we launch our armies on thy coasts And drag thee chained o'er that rough road and long Trod by Valerian.’ Let me read once more: Writ by his hand, and by his sigil sealed! So be it! My boyhood's vision stands before me! From Ganges' mouths to Calpé's Rock one realm! Insolent boy! Well knows he I am old: I was: I am not: youth is mine once more: To-morrow in my army's van I ride. Euphorbos! Sleep'st thou? Send me heralds forth! Summon my captains! Bid these mummers cease!— The error of my life lies plain before me, That fifteen years of peace. Note. —The next day Constantine set out on his Persian expedition; he fell sick at Hellenopolis, a city erected by him in honour of his Mother, the Empress Helena. He demanded Baptism, and died soon after he had received it. THE LEGEND OF SAINT ALEXIS. A ROMAN LEGEND. (DIED A.D. 398.) PART I. ARGUMENT. Euphemian, the descendant of a great Roman stock, is a Christian, as is Aglaë, his wife; and each day they have three tables set forth—one for orphans, one for widows, and one for pilgrims. After many years a son is granted to their prayers. While yet a child, he is esteemed by all Christian Rome to be a Saint. In time, his parents contract the youth to a Greek maiden. On the day of his marriage, there is sent to Alexis one of those wondrous mandates from on high, whereof men read in the sacred Scriptures; and he at once leaves all, and abides at Edessa, among the pilgrims who kneel in the porches of its chief church. After many years, a second divine mandate requires him to return to his father's house, and abide there unknown till death. There he lies ever in a little cell under a marble staircase, being unable to rise through great pains. After many years, when death draws nigh, he commands that paper and ink should be brought; and he writes down his history and dies alone. As soon as that scroll is read there is great lamentation in the house; but God turns that sorrow into joy, and Alexis is followed to his grave by all the great ones of Rome; and the house of his fathers is changed into a church, which remains to this day. In Rome long since upon Mount Aventine There stood a marble palace vast and fair 'Mid gardens rich in mulberry and vine, With columned atrium and Parian stair, Statued by godlike forms at either side, Ancestral chiefs, a Roman noble's pride. That stock was ancient when great Cæsar fell; Ancient when Hannibal with gloomy brow From Zama rode, till then invincible; Ancient when Cincinnatus left his plough; Ancient when Liberty in crimson dyed Leaped forth, re-virgined, from a virgin's side— Virginia's bleeding 'neath her father's knife; Ancient when Rome in civil conflict reeled By rapine torn or fratricidal strife Ill fruit of that Licinian Law repealed, And free-born peasants, famed in peace and war, Gave place to slaves, base scum from realms afar. Then too the Euphemian race held high its head Above the custom new and mist of error; The native husbandmen with freedom's tread Walked still its fields; in gladness not in terror Their young, fair daughters, rising from the board, Greeted the entrance of an unfeared lord. He came not only when the flocks were shorn To claim his half; when corn-clad slopes grew fat; When russet sheaves to golden barns were borne; When olives bled, or grapes made red the vat: He stood among them when the son was wed; He followed to his grave the grandsire dead. Centuries went by; they brought a dread reward: That Senate-Order of a later day, Fooled by their flatterers, by their slaves abhorred, Reaped as they sowed, each upstart anarch's prey Successively proscribed. 'Mid seas of blood The Empire by the dead Republic stood. The Christian Truth, held truly, had sufficed Even then to save that Empire: nought availed The name invoked but not the Faith of Christ, Or Faith that made its boast in words, but failed To rear on Pagan wrecks of sense and pride The Christian throne of greatness sanctified. The imperial sceptre to the East transferred Left prouder still the West. More high each day The pomp up-swelled of Rome's great Houses, stirred By legendary lore and servile lay, And hungry crowds contented long to wait The bread-piled basket at the palace-gate. ‘My Lord receives his clients.’ In they throng, Freedman and slave, Greek cook and Syrian priest, Wizard and mime, adepts in dance or song; The perfumed patron, recent from the feast Or drunken slumbers reddening still his eyes, Enters; and plausive shouts insult the skies, Startling a score of scriveners, forms grotesque That bend lean foreheads, seamed by fevered veins, Across the ledger broad or mouldering desk; For then each Roman noble held domains By Rhenus, Rhodanus, and every shore That hears or viol's sigh or panther's roar. Those nobles seldom rode to battle-fields; They steered to distant ports no ships broad-sailed; But well they knew that gain which usury yields; Or, borrowing oft, when tricksome fortune failed Pawned their best plate and many a gem beside, Knee-crooked to soothe some upstart lender's pride. The gilded barge is launched: a score of slaves Drag back the flashing oars; a second score With incense charge each wind that curls the waves, Or harmonize blue Baiæ's watery floor With strains that charmed Calypso's halls erewhile, Or lured Ulysses t'ward the Siren's isle. They trod the marbles of the Thermæ vast Their skirts aflame with legend-broideries; Bull-born, Europa here the Bosphorus passed, The Idean shepherd there adjudged the prize; Or Venus, fisher turned, with bending rod Down dropped a wet-winged Cupid on the sod. Their litters borne by sweating slaves, they clomb On August noons Soracte's steepest ridge; Or, pinnace-cradled, pushed the creamy foam Onward through dusk Avernus' waving sedge; They turned not there great Maro's page, yet oft Alike the Poet and his Sibyl scoffed. Temples and shrines adorned their palaces; Syrian the rite once Roman, later Greek: Old libraries remained: they sought them less For song heroic than for tale lubrique; Here sophists warred in turn on body and soul; There dust lay thick on Plato's godlike scroll. Travelling, a troop Numidian cleared their way; Their carrucæ were silver, gold-émbossed; In festal barge they coasted Cumæ's bay: If there a keener gust the ripple crossed They shook like some sick child that sees in dream Ixion's doom or rage of Polypheme. Harp, lyre, and lute for ever dinned their bowers; But witless, loud, or shrill was every strain: They feared the incense-breath of innocent flowers Yet quaffed their wine-cups near the uncovered drain; Feared omens more than wrath divine, and fled The fevered child, the parent's dying bed. The poison root of those base ways was this: Self-love had slain or fouled each household tie: The wedded seldom loved, or loved amiss: Child-birth was tribute paid to ancestry; Rottenness reigned: the World, grown old, stripped bare, More ruled than when the Witch was young and fair. Need was there that the Lord of Love should burst Once more on man as in man's prime estate, And, teaching that the ‘First Command’ is first The ‘Second’ second only, vindicate For human loves that greatness theirs alone When Love's far source and heavenly end are known. Ages of Sin had heaped on high a debt Heroic Virtue could alone defray: The limb ill-joined could never be re-set Till broken; Love, till cleansed, resume its sway. Conventual cells that seemed to spurn the earth And hermit caves, built up the Christian Hearth. Fire-scorched Thebais, lion-tenanted! 'Twas in thy lion's abdicated lair Ascetic Virtue laid its infant head: The heart, dried up, found waters only there: That Faith burnt in upon it from above By pain, sent up at last Faith's offspring—Love. Rome caught the sacred flame. Brave men, and those Infected least by wealth and popular praise Could walk in strength, in dignity repose, In part were faithful to the old Roman ways: Matrons there were on whom Cornelia's eye Might rest; and youths well pleased like Regulus to die. Pagan were these ofttimes, but less revered Venus than Pallas, Plutus less than Pan: The gods ‘Pandemian’ they nor loved nor feared: In nobler gods the noblest thoughts of man Looked down, so deemed they, from the Olympian throne, Or types or delegates of that ‘God Unknown.’ Others, incensed at priestly conjuring trick, Reluctant bade the fane profaned adieu, But with the Sophist's godless rhetoric Their own hearts wronged not. Far as truth they knew They lived it; wrought for man, and peace ensued Branding the Bad, and cleaving to the Good. An exhalation of celestial grace Moved o'er the Empire from the Martyrs' tombs: Christians, oft slaves, were found in every place; Their words, their looks, brightened the heathen gloom: Such gleams still hallow Antoninus' page, The saintly Pagan and Imperial Sage. Prescient of fate the old worship lay in swoon, Helpless though huge, dying and all but dead; The young Faith clasped it as the keen new moon A silver crescent risen o'er ocean's bed Clasps that sad orb whose light from earth is won:— Its youthful conqueror parleys with the sun. The Poor came first, and reaped the chief reward; Old Houses next: Truth loves Humility: Humility is humblest when most hard To reach—the lowliness of high degree: Such bowed to Christ: in turn He gave to them The stars of Truth's whole heaven for diadem. The thought of greatness in them long had dwelt: The difference 'twixt the greatness counterfeit And genuine greatness plainly now they felt: Eyes had they; and they saw it. Henceforth sweet Was every sacrifice that Vision brought: No wish had these to purchase heaven for naught. They knew 'twas sense and valour, not the hand In unguents drenched, that won the world for Rome: Sublimer ends sublimer pains demand: A spiritual kingship, country, hope, and home Shone out and hailed them from the far-off shore— ‘To sea, though tempests rage and breakers roar!’ Piercing remorse was theirs whene'er they mused On all which God to Rome in trust had given; The majesties profaned, the rights abused: What help to earth, what reverence to heaven, Had these bequeathed? What meant her realm world-wide? Injustice throned, and Falsehood deified! Through all that boundless realm from East to West Had Virtue flowered? Had Wisdom come to fruit? Had Freedom raised to heaven her lordlier crest? Had household Peace pushed down a deeper root? More true were wives, were maids more pure that day Than Portia, Clelia, or Nausicaa? Behold, the flowering was of vices new; The fruitage fruits of hate and self-disgust; Knowledge had bathed her roots in lethal dew: If higher now her branching head she thrust The Upas shade spread wider than of old; And wealth had bound man's heart in chains of gold. The Christian noble spurned the old Roman pride; Whate'er the Christian prized the Pagan hated, And clasped, his zeal by wrath intensified, Rome's meanest boasts with passion unabated: Their homes stood near: for that cause further still The inmates were estranged in thought and will. The Christian ofttimes sold his all, and gave The poor its price; another kept his lands But spent their increase freeing serf and slave, Himself sustained by labour of his hands: Thus each renounced himself, for others wrought Yet found that personal good he had not sought. Wedded were some, and reverently to Christ Upreared a race to Him obedient. Some For His sake hearth and household sacrificed; Others, in that fresh dawn of Christendom, Though spoused lived on in vestal singleness, Young chastity's severe yet sweet excess. Of Christian homes the noblest and the first Was that huge palace on Mount Aventine: Fortune and Pagan spite had done their worst: They maimed it, yet not marred. The time's decline Made it but holier seem. The Christian Truth Shone, starlike, from its breast in endless youth. Three hundred freemen served there as of yore, Bondsmen whilom. The clients of old time Walked there as children, parasites no more; Mastery and service, like recurrent rhyme, Kissed with pure lip; for one great reverence swayed Alike their hearts who ruled and who obeyed. The beast that drew the water from the well In nearer stream had earlier quenched his thirst, Nor laboured over-burdened: placable Was each man: vengeance there was held accursed: Before one altar knelt the high, the low; Heard the same prayer: it rose for friend and foe. Euphemian was the name far-known of him The lord of all those columned porticoes Those gardens vast with ilex alleys dim Those courts enriched with orange and with rose: Happy in youth; thrice happier since his bride, Aglae, paced those halls her lord beside. She was a being beautiful as day, Tender and pliant to her husband's will As to the wind that flower each breath can sway While branch and blade hang near it hushed and still, And therefore ‘wind-flower’ named. On her Christ's Poor Looked ever with moist eyes and trust secure. One thing alone was wanting to this pair— The sound of children's feet patting the floor, The ring of children's laughter on the air, Their clamorous joy at opening of a door To see, to clasp their parents newly come From watery Tibur or green Tusculum. The Poor pray well: at last the prayer was heard From countless hearths ascending eve and morn; From countless hearts. The joy so long deferred Was sent at last; the longed-for boy was born. That day all Rome kept festival; that night Each casement shone, and every face was bright. The months went swiftly by: the Seven-Hilled City Well loved that Babe; the poor man's boast was he, The theme of neighbour's tale and minstrel's ditty: Maiden and matron clasped him on her knee: And many a saintly mother said—and smiled— ‘Christ died a Man: but came to earth a Child!’ Once as he slept his mother near him knelt: She prayed as never she had prayed before, And, praying, such an inspiration felt As though some breeze from God o'er ocean's floor Missioned from Bethlehem's star-loved crib, came flying O'er her and him in that small cradle lying. One night within her memory rose that word Simeon to Blessed Mary spake erewhile, ‘Also through thine own soul shall pierce the sword;’ She mused, like those who weep at once and smile, ‘The Mother of a Saint, how great soe'er Her joy, in Mary's sacred grief must share!’ Years passed: a Monk, that child at vespers singing ‘Salve Regina,’ while a tear down stole, Spake thus, that anthem through the rafters ringing, ‘That voice is music of a singing Soul! Yon child shall live on earth as lives a Spirit; When dead, some crown seraphic shall inherit!’ The child became the boy, but never lost That charm which beautified his childhood's ways: Skilful the most of those the quoit who tossed Or chased the boar, he nothing did for praise, Nor e'er in feast or revel sought a part; Rome was to him pure as a forest's heart. Raptured he read her legends of old time— The Father-Judge who doomed his sons to die; The Wife that, sentencing another's crime, Pierced her own heart, then sank without a sigh. Great Acts to him were all: not then he knew That oft Endurance wins a crown more true. Later, for him the Meditative wore Greatness more great than Action's, and more dear: The weight of Thought with neck unbowed he bore As Saints their aureole crowns. All objects near Were lost in lights of sunset or sunrise: His one sole passion was Self-Sacrifice. His guides in Christian as in Classic lore Boasted untired the youth's intelligence: Ere long he marked these twain were still at war, The prophets one of Spirit, one of Sense: ‘I will not serve two masters;’ thus he cried, And pushed the flower-decked pagan scroll aside. Was it that sacred moment shaped his life, Keeping it flawless? Thousands safeliest pace Faith's lower road, dusty and dinned with strife; Not so the man elect to loftier place, For sins in others small are great in him Whose grace is large—such grace least stains bedim. Thenceforth his ‘eye was single.’ Loss was gain To him, since Suffering had the world redeemed; For that cause still he sought the haunts of pain; Still on the sufferer's couch like morn he beamed, And in his father's house with wine and bread Served still God's Poor, or with them sat and fed. He lived a life all musical, for still Discords of earth by faith grew harmonized; He lived in a great silence, spirit and will Hushed in his God. Because naught else he prized Loud as that first, great world-creating word, God's ‘small, still voice’ within him, still he heard. Nothing in him was sad, nothing morose; The serious face still tended to a smile; In him sorrow and joy still harboured close, Like eve and dawn met in some boreal isle. Bad actions named, sad looked he and surprised; But seldom strove, rebuked, or criticised. There were who marvelled at his piercing thought; There were who marvelled at his simpleness: High Truths, and Inspirations rapture-fraught Came to his mind like angels: not the less Where fools walk well at times his footstep erred: He heard the singing spheres, or nothing heard. Father and mother both with tender pride Loved him: there only, pride regained a part; They who had spurned the world, its scorn defied, Now gladdened that their son had won its heart. They smiled when kinsmen said: ‘This boy shall raise Waste places of thy House in later days!’ ‘All that is mine Alexis must inherit,’ He answered. Then the mother, ‘Who is she Worthy by race, by beauty, and by merit To be to him true wife as I to thee?’ Such maid they sought long time; when hope was o'er They found her—found on earth's most famous shore. Her race had dwelt in Athens ere it wrestled With Sparta for the foremost place in Greece; Earlier, in Colchian vales, less known had nestled Ere Jason thence had filched the Golden Fleece. Thus to his mates on wintry nights her sire Boasted—true Greek—beside the fir-cone fire. Euphemian and that sire were ancient friends So far as Greek and Roman friends might be, Friends in their youth; but though unlikeness blends Natures cognate with finer sympathy, So diverse these, men said 'twas memory's tie, Not love's, that held them still, through severance, nigh. Few months ere died the Greek, that friend of old Had sought him out, and standing by his bed, Had vowed to nurture in his own fair fold That orphan lonely left. Her father dead, And sacred mourning days expired, the twain Spread sail for Rome across the wine-dark main. At sea, to please the maid, her guardian took The sweet and venerable name of Sire; Her winsome grace, her wit, her every look— But few could witness such and not admire; Gravely Euphemian marked them, sadly smiled; Yet loved her as a father loves his child. Likewise, as up and down his musings swayed, A thought recurred: ‘The girl is light of wing! What then? Alexis is too grave and staid: Christian she is; to each the years must bring Fit aid by friendly difference best supplied: Ere three months more Zoe shall be his bride.’ Zoe, the loveliest of Athenian girls, Was prouder thrice to bear the Athenian name Than if the East had rained its gems and pearls Knee-deep about her path. To Rome she came Curious, yet spleenful too. The world's chief site To her meant sceptred dulness, brainless might. The ship that bore her thither smiled to waft Creature so bright; smooth seas revered their charge: Cythera's uplands, as she neared them, laughed: The Ætnean heights, Trinacria's wave-washed marge, Gladdened; they sang, ‘Our Proserpine again Is come to gather flowers on Enna's plain!’ When Zoe entered Rome, she turned, heart-sick, From arch and column flattering regal pride, From cliff-like walls up-piled of sun-burned brick Beneath whose shade men lion-torn had died, From alien obelisks hieroglyph-o'ergraven, For centuries glassed in Egypt's stillest haven. That mood went by: sudden the cloud she spurned And, shaking from lashed lids an angry tear, To that mute man beside her, laughing, turned And spake: ‘The trophies of all lands are here! Rome conquered earth: but why? Too dull her brain For better tasks, the victories which remain! ‘They boast their Heroes: but they love them not! Lo, there! An Emperor stands yon column's crown! What Greek would strain his eyes to scan a spot Jet-black in sun-bright skies? No Attic clown! There Trajan towers, and, eastward, Antonine: O brains Beotian, fatter than your kine!’ Lightly thus spake that beaming creature hard, Nor noted that, as one in still disdain, Her comrade silent rode. A fixed regard He bent upon a cross-surmounted fane: A Grecian temple near it stood: his eye Saw but that small, low church, that sunset sky. He answered late: ‘Your Grecian pride of Art, Daughter, and Rome's old pagan pride of arms, Alike stand sentenced here. For Christian heart No greatness save of heavenly birth hath charms. In Rome the Faith found martyrs three long ages: She won but audience from the Athenian sages!’ The beauteous one looked up; her sensitive lip And tender cheek asked leave, it seemed, to smile; Then, as a bud that frosts of April nip, That smile, discouraged, died. Pensive awhile She rode; her palfrey nearer drew to his: She raised his hand, and pressed thereon a kiss. ‘Forgive,’ she said, ‘the petulance of youth! Wisdom serene, and Virtue proved by years, Note not—’ She wept; but soon her cheek in sooth Like leaves rain-washed beamed brighter for her tears, And livelier than before her critic tongue This way and that its shafts of satire flung. At times the unbending Roman smiled perforce; At times the patriot stern essayed to frown: She noted either mood; and her discourse Accordant winged its light way up or down Like those white-pinioned birds that sink then soar O'er high-necked waves breasting a sandy shore. The sun had set; they clomb Mount Aventine, That Augur-haunted height. They paused: she saw Old Tiber, lately bright, in sanguine line Wind darkening t'wards the sea. A sudden awe Chilled her. She felt once more that evening breeze Which waves that yew-grove of the Eumenides Where Athens fronts Colonos. There of old Sat Destiny's blind mark, King Œdipus; And, oft as she had passed it, shudderings cold Ran through her fibred frame, made tremulous As the jarred sounding-board of lyre or harp: So thrilled the girl that hour with shiverings sharp. ‘I know it! This is Rome's Oracular Hill! Dreadful it looks; a western Calvary! A sacrificial aspect dark and still It wears, that saith, “Prepare, O man, to die!” Father! you house not on this mount of Fate?’ Thus as she spake they reached his palace gate. There stood, still fair—tenderer than when more young— She who had made her husband's youth so bright: Long to her neck the Athenian Exile clung Wearied and sad. Not less that festal night The gladsomest of the radiant throng was she, Centre and soul of Roman revelry. PART II. ‘All hail to Rome! She lords it o'er the world From Ganges' flood to Atlas' snowy crown: Heavenward from cape and coast her praise is hurled: She lifts the nations up and casts them down: Like some great mountain city-thronged she stands Her shade far cast eclipsing seas and lands. ‘She flings that shade across the tracts of Time Not less than o'er the unmeasured fields of space; Processional the Empires paced sublime; Her heralds these; they walked before her face: Assyrian, Persian, Grecian—what were they? Poor matin streaks, yet preludes of the day! ‘The Pyramids that vault Egyptian kings When near her legions drew bowed low their heads; Indus and Oxus from their mountain springs Whispered, “She cometh.” Dried-up river-beds From Dacian plains to British cried aghast, “This way but now the Roman eagles passed!” ‘She fells the forest, and the valley spans With arch o'er arch; the mountain-crests she carves With roads, till Nature's portents yield to Man's: Wolf-like the race that mocks her bleeds or starves; Alike they lived their lives, they had their day: Her laws abide; men hear them and obey. ‘All hail to Rome! Her mighty heart serene Houses at will all nations and their gods Content to know herself of all the Queen. Who spake that word: “The old Religion nods?” Ah fools! at times, but gathering heat, the levin Sleeps in Jove's hand. Yet Jove reigns on in heaven.’ Such was the song that from beyond that wall Girdling the palace pleasaunce swelled what time Zoe awoke, till then sleep's lovely thrall, And marked the splendours of the dewy prime Brightening the arras nymphs beyond her bed; Upright she sat, and propped a listening head. She listened as the choral echo rang Lessening from stem to stem, from stone to stone; Then rose, and, tossing wide the casement, sang In briefer note a challenge of her own: ‘Ye prized the old Faith—dying or dead condole it— That Faith was Greek, my masters! Rome but stole it!’ That faith was hers in childhood; threads thereof Still gleamed 'mid all those golden tissues woven Which decked her fancy's world of thought and love; Her conscience clung to Truths revealed, heartproven: Her fancy struck no root into the true, A rock-flower fed on ether and on dew. She had a pagan nurse and Christian mother: That mother taught her girl the Christian Creed; She learned it, she believed: yet scarce could smother Memories first hers of heathen race and breed Which, claiming to be legend only, won Perchance more credence as exacting none. When girt by pagans, she their rites derided: The Christian Faith, that only, she revered; Yet oft at Christian hearths with sceptics sided: Sacred Religion less she loved than feared, Still muttering sadly; ‘Easy 'tis, I wean, To dread the Unknown, but hard to love the Unseen.’ Stronger she was in intellect than spirit; In intellect's self less strong than keen and swift: Immeasurable in beauty, interest, merit To her was Nature's sphere; but hers no gift To roam through boundless empires of the Soul: She craved the definite path—not distant goal. Seldom the girl's unlovelier moods looked forth When first she housed in that Euphemian home So rich in loftiest reverence, lowliest worth: There the great ways of Apostolic Rome Confronted her, and steadied and upraised: A part of heaven she saw where'er she gazed. And deeplier yet her better spirit was moved When, by Aglae led, she trod those spots Where bled the martyrs. Oft, torch-lit, they roved Those dusky ways like sea-wrought caves and grots Rome's subterranean city of the tombs, This hour her noblest boast—the Catacombs. The soundless floors with blood-stains still were red: Still lay the martyr in sepulchral cell The ensanguined vial close beside his head, ‘In pacé’ at his feet. Ineffable That peace around: the pictured walls confessed Its source divine in symbols ever blessed. Here the ‘Good Shepherd’ on His shoulder bare The sheep long lost. The all-wondrous Eucharist Was emblemed near. Close-bound in grave-clothes, there Lazarus stood still, fixed by the eye of Christ: Below his gourd the Prophet bowed his head, Prophet unweeting of the Three-days-Dead. Among the Roman martyrs two there were Whom most the Greek in wonder venerated, Cecilia and her spouse, that wedded pair Who lived their short, glad life like Spirits mated And hand in hand passed to the Crucified: ‘Oh, how unlike Aspasia!’—Zoe cried. One morn, from these returned, Aglae spake; ‘Husband, bestow this maiden on thy son! She loves our martyrs: that high love will make Their marriage blest and holy!’ It was done: By parents at that time were bridals made In Rome. Alexis heard them and obeyed. Zoe at first felt angry: thus she mused: ‘Unsued, and scarce consulted, to be wed!’ She mused again; this marriage, wisely used, May lift once more my country's fallen head: That was my dream since childhood: till I die That stands my purpose: now the means are nigh.’ Such was the leaning of her deeper nature; To some she seemed a Muse: to sterner eyes A Siren to be dreaded: but the creature Beneath her sallies gay and bright disguise Was inly brave and serious, strong and proud; A child of Greece, to that sad mother vowed. Betrothed they were what time the earlier snows Whitening Soracte's scalp were caked with frost: The marriage was postponed till April's close, Then later till the Feast of Pentecost. Meantime they met not oft. The youth had still High tasks—he loved all duties—to fulfil. Zoe thenceforth was welcomed more and more In all the Roman houses of old fame, Welcomed by pagans most: they set great store Upon her thoughtful wit and Attic name, And learned with help from her to read with ease The songs of Sappho and Simonides. Among them ranged a dame right eloquent On all the classic myths of ancient days: In each she found unrecognized intent Occult, and oft her jetty brows would raise Much wondering how a child of Academe Could slight Greek wisdom for a Hebrew dream. With her the Athenian strove that perilous season, Most confident belike when certain least. A perilous staff, for such, is boastful reason; On that whene'er she leaned her doubts increased; The Catacombs propped best a faith unstable: She said, ‘Those dear ones died not for a fable.’ A help beside 'gainst unbelieving sin Illumed her pathway. 'Twas the heaven-lit face Of him, her destined husband. None therein Might gaze ungladdened by a healing grace; Round him he breathed Faith's sweet yet strengthening clime, Like sea-winds sent o'er hills of rock and thyme. He spake: the Grecian girl with instinct keen Felt oft he told of things to him well known, And for an hour through God's high worlds unseen Advanced as one who sees. But when alone Faith lacked what Love Divine alone could lend her: Her nature, was impassioned, yet not tender. Her mental powers were wide and far of gaze; Ardent her heart, but yet to earth confined: Her sympathies trod firm on solid ways But cast no heavenward pinions on the wind, Felt not the gravitation from above: The depths they knew, but not the heights of love. Large powers of human love in her had dwelt Unknown, long checked like tarns on hillside stayed By bars of virgin ice not quick to melt: In vain her country's sons their court had paid: She spurned them: Greece lay bound, a spoil, a jest; They in her degradation acquiesced! Her Roman suitors she had spurned yet more Save one: she saw in each her country's foe: That one, strange nurseling of a mystic lore, Was brave as wise, and just to high and low: The ice had burst: the torrent took its way: ‘How slowly comes,’ she thought, ‘this marriageday!’ She loved Alexis well: he loved her better; Better, not more. She loved with all her heart; He with a portion, for he brooked no fetter That bound his spirit to earth. To her a part He gave in his large being—not the whole; 'Tis thus they love whose love is of the soul. Ofttimes when most she loved she scorned to show it, Deeming her love repaid by his but half: Ofttimes she wept; but, fearing he should know it, Drank down her tears, or praised with petulant laugh What least he loved; or curtsied in her spleen Passing the fane, still thronged, of Beauty's Queen. Sometimes, approaching Constantine's huge piles That lifted o'er vast courts their shadowing span As o'er dusk waters frown Egean isles, St. Paul's, the Lateran, or the Vatican, She seemed to see them not; but stooped and raised A violet from the grass, and kissed and praised. He judged her not, yet mused in boding thought: ‘This marriage—will it help yon orphan maid?’ The answer followed plain: ‘I never sought The tie. My parents willed it: I obeyed: If they have erred, ere long a hand more high Will point my way. Till then no choice have I.’ More seldom still they met: but when they met Airs as from heaven played on her spirit's chords; And seldom if he spake, with eyes tear-wet She sighed; ‘A man is he of deeds not words!’ Poor child! She guessed not 'twas her wayward will Slighting the themes he loved that held him silent still. She knew him not; his parents but in part: They wist not this, that, though to seats divine Great Love at times can lift the earthly heart, On hearts enskied as oft it works decline. Their course was well-nigh run, their heaven nigh gained; One sole temptation—and its cure—remained. The marriage morn had come. At faith's high call Ere sunrise yet the dewy groves had dried The youth was praying in a chapel small That stood retired by Tiber's streaming tide; Though dull the morn, the boats with flags were gay: A pagan Feast they kept—Rome's natal day. Returning from that church, the youth observed That 'mid these boats white-winged, and by the bank A bark lay moored where Tiber seaward curved; It bore no flag; its sails were black and dank— A stern sea-stranger seemed it, sad, alone; A raven 'mid bright birds of dulcet tone. Down from that sable bark there moved a man With sunburnt brow, worn cheek, and mournful eyes: He to the youth made way, and straight began: ‘A sailor I, and live by merchandise: I seek Laodicea: from her shore Edessa we shall reach in three days more. ‘There, in her church who bore the Lord of all Abides for aye that “Venerable Face” Which, like those shadows Apostolical That healed the sick, fill all that land with grace. Thou know'st not of that mystery. Give ear! Elect are they who hold that picture dear. ‘When Christ, Who died for Man, by slow degrees Bearing His Cross ascended Calvary, O'er-spent at last He sank upon His knees: Then of the Holy Women clustering nigh One forward stept. Above that Face, bedewed With blood, she pressed her veil, and weeping stood. ‘Since then abides upon that Veil all-blest Edessa's Boast, that imaged Face Divine Thereon that hour by miracle impressed: Some see it not. Who see it never pine Thenceforth for earthly goods. True merchant he Who all things sells for one. This night embark with me!’ ‘This is my wedding-day,’ the youth replied: Then round them closed sea-farers loud of cheer And severed was that Stranger from his side: Through all their din thenceforth he seemed to hear Sad memory's iteration wearisome, ‘Wedded am I: therefore I cannot come.’ Entering his ancient home in troubled thought Once more he heard, ‘He who great wealth hath won Let that man live as pilgrims who have naught; The wedded man as he who wife hath none’— Words heard at Mass the morning of that Feast Whereon his bride had landed from the East. He raised his eyes: changed was his Father's house: Euphemian thus had sworn: ‘For one day more Return old times! The poor man's glad carouse; The harps and dances of our Rome of yore. Rome reverenced marriage once: this marriage long Shall boast its place in Roman tale and song.’ Where was it now, that rust which long had covered The mail of Consuls famed in days that were? Banners as old as Cannæ swung and hovered Shifting with gusts of laughter-shaken air; And on the walls hung faded tapestries old The Pagan mostly dimmed by moth and mould. Here shone the Huntress Maid the crescent gleam Brightening her brow: that Radiance disarrayed Whitened with imaged shape the forest stream: There Galatea with sea-monsters played; The self-same breeze that landward o'er the rocks Waved the dark pine blew back her refluent locks. Not far stood Pallas wrought in stone. That eye Levelled beneath strong brows and helmèd crest Though stern looked forth in wisdom clear and high: The Gorgon Mask lay moveless on a breast That ne'er had heaved with love or shook with fear; High up her hand sustained that steadying spear. The Christian Art was tenderest. There that Boy Blessed Sebastian, pierced by arrows, stood In maid-like and immaculate beauty. Joy Illumed his front, though dying, unsubdued: And well those lifted eyes discerned in heaven That Face Divine His Martyr hailed—Saint Stephen. Tables there were of sandal-wood carved quaintly By fingers lean of cedar-shaded Ind, Embossed with emblems, shapes grotesque yet saintly; And gods Egyptian, taloned, winged or finned; And ivory cabinets with ebon barred, Musk-scented, pale with pearl, and opal-starred. Here glittered caskets, gifts of Afric kings; Gold goblets, pledge from satraps of the East; Huge incense-burning lamps on demon wings Suspense, for rites of funeral or feast; And shells for music strung and bows for war, Fantastic toys, tribute from regions far. Mosaic pavements glistened, deftly studded With Sphinx, or Zodiac-Beast, or Hieroglyph, As oft with Lotos blossom. Leaned, new-budded The April Almond from his shaggy cliff, Or rained red flakes on Ocean's blameless daughters Oaring their placid way o'er purple waters. The nuptial rite was brief, the banquet long For many a grey-haired noble told his tale And many a youthful minstrel sang his song; Some marked a trembling in the bride's white veil, But on her long-lashed lids there hung no tear; Flushed was her cheek; her voice was firm and clear. Within a tent upon that bowery level Whose tallest palm-grove crowned Mount Aventine, Hour after hour rang out that ardent revel, While flashed above it many a starry sign; Untired that Bride danced on; beneath the shade The night-bird sang to listening youth and maid. Alexis moved amid the throng, heart-sore, Yet welcoming friend or guest. Pastimes like these His eyes had never looked upon before; Now seeing, he misliked them. Ill at ease, One voice he heard 'mid all that buzz and hum; ‘I have a Wife; therefore I cannot come.’ Far down, where Tiber caught the white moonshine, He heard, though faint, that hymn at morning sung, More near, then first, those verses Fescennine Trolled by boy pagans as their nuts they flung: He sought the house, passed to its farthest room, Lit by one lamp that scarcely pierced the gloom. Within that room was one sole occupant; He stood beneath that lamp; its downward shade Clasped the slight form, and on him seemed to plant A dusky cowl. Sudden with heart dismayed The youth that morning's stranger saw, and nigh The Saviour on His Cross, and Calvary. That Saviour looked on him and spake. In heart That Bridegroom heard: ‘Edessa—meet Me there; There bide with Me alone; and thence depart When I that sow, homeward My sheaves shall bear. Those three thou lov'dst so well in days of old Shall then be thine—and Mine—in love tenfold.’ The Vision faded; lightest steps he heard, And wreathed with rose the Bride before him stood Warm from the dance, and blithesome as a bird. He spake: ‘Fear naught! What God decrees is good.’ Within her hand he placed a ring, and said: ‘Farewell! Wear this till many years are fled. ‘Farewell! Live on in Faith and Innocence: Farewell! God calls me to a far-off land; But He will lead me back Who bids me hence, And draw us near; and yet between us stand. Farewell, poor child!’ He passed into the night And soon was hidden wholly from her sight. When the next morn had changed dark skies to grey They found her with wide eyes and lips apart Standing, a statue wreathed, in white array; One wedded hand was pressed against her heart; One clasped a ring. ‘Tis time to sleep,’ she said; ‘Lay the poor Bride—'tis late—upon her bed.’ PART III. Not far from where Euphrates, that great river, From heights of Taurus seaward winds in flood Its mighty youth replenishing for ever, In days of yore a royal city stood: Two lesser streams embraced it like two arms That clasp some bright one in her bridal charms. Around it gleamed Plane-tree and Poplar shivering In Syrian gales tempered by mountain snows, And gardens green traversed by runnels quivering And Palms at each side set in columned rows: High in the midst a church of ancient fame There rose. Edessa was that city's name. Before that church there stood five porches fair Wherein the maimed and crippled sued for alms; Likewise God's penitents, admitted there As men beloved, might hear the hymns and psalms Until, their penance past, once more the shrine Received them, and they fed on food divine. Within that fivefold narthex one there knelt Of race unknown, and humbler than the rest, His garment hair-cloth 'neath a leathern belt; He deemed himself unmeet to stand a guest Within that hallowed precinct whose embrace Cherished the Veil all-blest and ‘Sacred Face.’ For that cause year by year he dwelt without Although in spirit kneeling still within; And neither civic pomp nor popular shout Made way to him. Propping a haggard chin On haggard hand he sat with low-bent brows Absorbed in heavenly thoughts, unearthly vows. Meantime o'er all the world's circumference Euphemian sent wise men to seek his son: Some to Laodicea sailed, and thence Their way like others to Edessa won; Near him they drew; upon him turned their eye; They knew him not; yet passed him with a sigh. There were who turned again, and, instinct-taught, Lodged on those fingers worn a piece of bread; And he with gladness ate it, for his thought Grew humbler daily; breaking it, he said ‘Thank God that I have eaten of their hand Whom once I fed and held at my command!’ So thus by patience and long-suffering first, And next through heart self-emptied to its core, The inmost of Christ's Teaching on him burst; And ‘Blessed they who mourn,’ ‘Blessed the poor,’ Lived on his lips, as he in them with awe The shrouded vision of God's greatness saw. He saw the things men see not. In a glass Nearer to God than Nature's best, in Man He saw that God Who ever is and was: In those whom this world lays beneath her ban The halt, the stricken, saw their Maker most: The saved he saw in those the fool deems lost. Now when those years were past, within the church One day, as vespers ceased, was heard a Voice, ‘Bring in My Son who kneeleth in the porch: The same shall see My Countenance and rejoice.’ Then forth God's people rushed, both old and young, And haled the man to where that picture hung. Instant that Pilgrim fixed his eyes thereon, And saw that Countenance through its mist of blood Which some see not: and still, ere set of sun, A change miraculous swifter than a flood O'erswept it. Grief and shame far off were driven: It shone as shines the Saviour's Face in heaven. And still he said: ‘Behold, these Faces twain Reveal the portions twain to man allowed; For one of these is earth and Holy Pain, And one is heavenly Glory, when the cloud Of time dissolves.’ And still his prayer he made For those far off: ‘Aid them, Thou Saviour, aid!’ 'Twas needed sore. The day Alexis fled His mother sat in ashes on the ground, And thenceforth day by day; and still she said, ‘Lo, thus I sit until the Lost is found!’ And night by night murmured the one-day bride, ‘His wife I am: faithful I will abide. ‘I will not muse, as once, in groves of Greece, Nor dance, as once, in palace halls of Rome; Until this wedded widowhood shall cease, Here with his parents I will make my home: I must be patient now, though proud of yore: He called me “Child!” He said, “We meet once more.”’ While sinks the sun nighing his watery bed The shadow reacheth soon the valley's breast; More late it climbeth to the mountain's head— His loved one gone, Euphemian hoped the best: Not yet the shade had reached him. Every morn He said: ‘Ere night Alexis may return! ‘The day my Son was born—the self-same hour— I shook the dust from many a treasured scroll Precious with lore which time would fain devour, The great deeds of our House. In one fair whole To blend those annals was my task for years: The pages bled: they cannot end in tears.’ But when his messengers from all the lands Returning, early some, and others late, From Gaul, Iberia, Thrace, from Syrian sands, Red Libyan coasts, and Calpé's golden gate, Brought back the self-same tidings as the first, That grief which reached him last was grief the worst. Silent he mused: ‘Were these our prayers of old? Sent was our child, that late-conceded boy, To be the lamb unblemished of our fold, Then vanish, and to by-word change our joy? Had he but won the martyr's crown and fame! But now God's Church shall never hear his name. ‘O ancient House, revered in days of yore, House blind yet just, I deemed that years to be Fourfold to thee, now Christian, would restore What time or heathen hate had reft from thee, And of thy greatness make a boon for all— That dream is over! Let the roof-tree fall!’ Thus as his father mourned Alexis knelt One day before that picture-hallowed shrine, When suddenly he heard at once and felt A voice oracular, awful yet benign: ‘This day in prayer be mighty for those Three, Since what to them I grant I grant through thee.’ Then prayed the Saint as Saints alone can pray; And on that far-off Three, they knew not why, There fell a calm undreamed of till that day, As when some great storm ceases from the sky Sudden, and into harbour sweeps the bark, And green hills laugh, and singing mounts the lark. Thenceforth for things gone by they hungered less, And of the joy to come had oftener vision; Thenceforth self-will inflamed not heart-distress, Nor pride that draws from pain perverse fruition: The parents saw their son once more a child; The wife, as when he saw her first, and smiled. Again a year passed by:—within his heart That son received an answer from his God: ‘Go to the great sea down, and thence depart To Tarsus, where My servant, Paul, abode; For I will show thee there by tokens true The things which thou must suffer and must do.’ The man of God arose, and gat him down To where Laodicea's mast-thronged bay Mirrored that queenly city's towery crown, And found a ship for Tarsus bound that day, And sailed till o'er the morn-touched deep arose Her walls, and hills beyond her white with snows. Then from those hills a storm rushed forth, as when An eagle from high cliffs has kenned its quarry; And the black ship before it raced like men Who flee the uplifted sword they dare not parry With necks low bent. So fled that ship: each sail Split; and the masts low leaned like willows in the gale. Amid the slanted rain of falling spars And roar of winds and billows far and near Astonished stood those sea-worn mariners Yet mute, since none his neighbour's voice might hear: Then heard God's Saint: ‘For all this company Fear nought; for thine they are. They shall not die. ‘Fear not for thine own self: this storm is Mine; The same shall lay thee by thy father's door: There shall the last storm greet thee—storm benign, For what I take, that fourfold I restore.’ Next morn they entered Tiber's mouth: at Rome He stood ere noon, and saw his father's home, Saw it far off whilst yet upon his way To earth's cathedral metropolitan, ‘Mother and Head of Churches,’ there to pray That what to him remained of life's brief span Might, through God's help, accomplish God's decree, And praise His name for all eternity. Entering, he knelt before that crypt cross-crowned Where in a subterranean chapel small Reposed, awaiting God's Last Trumpet's sound, The sacred bones of Peter and of Paul: A child he oft had knelt its gates before; There learned what God had yet for him in store. Evening drew nigh: he left the Lateran: Anon, as slow he paced Rome's stateliest street, From Cæsar's palace issued forth a man Though bent, majestic, with attendance meet. That man Alexis knew. With steadfast eye The sire drew near the son; and passed him by. Then cried that son with anguished voice and face ‘Servant of God, revered and loved of all, Within thy house yield me a little place That I may daily eat the crumbs that fall Down from thy table.’ And his sire replied: ‘So be it, Pilgrim: walk thou by my side.’ Through lonely ways dimmed by the day's decline That sire and son made way, and neither spake Till, step by step climbing Mount Aventine They reached that well-known mansion. Flake by flake The snows were falling. 'Twas not like the day Of that fair bridal in that far-off May. Alexis spake: ‘A stripling, sir, I saw Ofttime thy house; memory thereof I keep: Beneath the great stair—on a bed of straw— Slept then a mastiff: there I fain would sleep.’ And answered thus Euphemian: ‘Let it be! Long since he died: his place remains for thee.’ Once more the son: ‘Footsore and weak am I: 'Tis time to sleep: my pilgrimage is made: The mastiff died: the Pilgrim soon will die.’ Then down upon the straw his limbs he laid, And sank asleep. For hours, as there he slept Two women by his couch their vigil kept. Down from the head of one, silk-soft, snow-white, Rolled waves of hair: the younger kept her bloom Though worn. They sat beside him till twilight At last was lost in evening's deepening gloom, And longed that he might wake and eat; and spread Their silks and velvets closelier on his bed. At morn he woke. Anguish and crippling pain Fixed from that hour their eyes on that sole man; And like to dead men on the battle-plain Silent he lay. In pain his day began, In pain worked on till daylight's last had fled As though great nails had fixed him to his bed. And ever by his couch they ministered Who loved that sufferer well yet knew him not: For at the first note of the wakening bird That mother came who o'er her infant's cot Ere break of day so oft had peered; at noon His sire drew nigh: and when the rising moon Flung o'er the marble floor a beam as bright As that long path wherewith it paves the sea Softly she came upon whose bridal night So black a shade had fallen so suddenly; And on his bed sat in the white moonshine Like one that inly says: ‘This place is mine.’ Some deem they knew him not because so long Fierce Syrian suns that sweet face had imbrowned; And some because at God's command there clung A mist illusive still their eyes around; While some are sure that mist, deepening with years, Was unmiraculous, and a mist of tears. Yet one avers that, gazing evermore, Year after year upon that Sacred Face, Its semblance spread that Pilgrim's countenance o'er, Its anguish fixed, its gleams of heavenly grace, So that who saw the living face, beneath That veil saw, too, the Face of Christ in death. But when his parents at high festivals Serving the mighty Rite were absent long A slave, late Pagan, reared in those great halls Of him had charge. At times he did him wrong; Then cried—that blow rebuked by no complaint— ‘The man's a fool! Not less the fool's a Saint!’ And oft an Elder to his couch there came Old ere his time, with haught yet pleading eye, Who spake: ‘My sires to me an ancient name Bequeathed. When I am dead, that name shall die.’ The pilgrim answered: ‘Household none on earth Can last, save Christ's. The rest are nothing worth.’ And oft a woman sat beside that bed Meek-eyed, with soft white hair: ‘A child had I: The twentieth winter now is past and fled: That child returns not. O that I might die!’ And he replied: ‘Have courage, and endure; Pray well; and find thy children in Christ's Poor.’ And many a time low-bent beneath the rod One proud of old, still fair as fair may be, Though bright no longer, spake: ‘Pray, man of God, That, living yet, my husband I may see A living man!’ Softly he made reply: ‘Yea, thou shalt see thy husband ere thou die!’ And ever when those Three were set at meat Euphemian sent him viands, flesh and wine, But he of barley crusts alone would eat: And still, he spake to them of things divine; And still, when back he sank and ceased from speech Musing they sat, or staring each on each. For others spake of great things through the ear Divulged to faith: he spake of great things seen That flash as stars descried through ether clear, Clearer for frosty skies and north wind keen: The Martyr means the Witness: such was he, Martyr, not slain, of selfless charity. At times the old passion in their bosoms burned; At times the wound half-healed welled forth anew; Then to that man of woes those strong ones turned, Child-like; and thus he gave them solace true: ‘God yearns to grant you peace, yet waits until Your wills are one with His all-loving Will.’ And when they said, ‘Weary we grow of prayer Because God hath not given us that we sought,’ He answered: ‘Love in God, and work, and bear; Let no man say, “Serve they their God for nought?” Pray for great Rome; for him your Lost One pray, That he be faithful till his dying day.’ Suns rose and set; the seasons circled slow; Upon that House settled a gradual peace Breathed from that spot obscure and pallet low; Yea, as the dews of midnight drench a fleece So drenched was every heart with that strange calm, And wounds long festered felt the healing balm. Now when the years decreed had all gone by There came from God an answer to His Saint: ‘Rejoice! Thy work is worked, and thou shalt die:’ Then gave he thanks in happy tone though faint, And, turning to that slave with quiet smile, Demanded parchment scroll and writing-style. Straightway he wrote the story of his life And God's Command in love that spares not, given; And ended thus: ‘O Parents, and O Wife! We meet ere long: no partings are in heaven. I loved you well. Strangely my faith God proved: Yet know that few are loved as ye were loved. ‘Farewell! God sent you trials great below Because for you He keeps great thrones on high: Likewise by you God willeth to bestow New gifts on man. Each dear domestic tie Whereof so many a year ye stood amerced Shall yet rule earth—but raised and hallowed first. ‘Because ye loved your God as few men love He called you forth His witnesses to be That Love there is all human loves above, A Love all-gracious in its jealousy That, all exacting, all suffices too; The world must learn this lesson, and from you.’ When all was writ he crossed upon his breast His arms, and in his right hand clasped that scroll: And as the Roman monks arose from rest Nocturns to chant, behold, that dauntless soul Cleansed here on earth by fire expiatory When none was near passed hence into the glory: At noontide, in the Lateran basilic, Blessed Pope Innocent who, throned that day High in Saint Peter's world-wide bishopric O'er all the churches of the world held sway Had sung at Mass that text, though dread, benign, ‘Unless a man leave all he is not Mine.’ That moment from the Holy Place a Voice Went forth: ‘All ye who labour, come to Me:’ And yet again: ‘All ye that weep, rejoice!’ At once that mighty concourse sank on knee And each man laid his forehead near the ground: Then, close to each, those pillared aisles around Distinct and clear thus heard they, word by word: ‘Seek out My Saint, and bid him pray for Rome: Yea, if he pray, his pleading shall be heard That lighter thus My Judgments may become, For now the things concerning Rome have end. Seek in Euphemian's house My Servant and My Friend.’ That hour uprising in procession went The Roman People. With them paced that day The Emperors twain, and holy Innocent Between them, higher by the head than they. Their crowns Arcadius and Honorius wore, His mitre Blessed Peter's successor. Arrived, they questioned if beneath that roof There dwelt a Saint. The Christians said: ‘Not here;’ Then rose that whilome slave that sat aloof, He who had watched the sick man all that year: He spake: ‘A Saint is here; I did him wrong, Yet never heard from him upbraiding tongue.’ Straight to that marble stair Euphemian ran And passed beneath its central arch; and lo! Dead on his small straw pallet lay the man; And on that face, so long a face of woe, Strange joy there lived and mystical content; And o'er him with wide wings an Angel bent. Aloud Euphemian cried: they flocked around And saw and knelt. But some that stood espied That parchment in the dead hand clasped and wound, And strove to loose it. To that pallet's side The brother Emperors drew, and each was fain To win it from his hold, but strove in vain. Lastly Pope Innocent approached, and spread Softly upon the dead man's hand his own; And lo, that parchment dropped upon the bed: Long, standing by that sacred head alone The Pontiff eyed that scroll—at last he raised; While each man, rising, nearer drew and gazed. He spread it wide: he read: the listeners trembled; Each heart beat slow, and every cheek grew pale And strong men wept with passion undissembled; For short, and plain, and simple was that tale: No praise it sued; no censure seemed to shun: Record austere of great things borne and done. Now when Euphemian saw these things, and heard, Motionless stood the man like shape of stone; Ere long he fell a-shivering without word; And lastly dropped upon the pavement prone: But when kind arms had raised him, on the dead He fixed unseeing eyes, and nothing said. Next through that concourse rushed the Mother, wailing, ‘Let be! Shall I not see the babe I bore?’ And reached the dead; and then, her forces failing, Sank to her knees, and eyed him, weeping sore; And as a poplar sways in stormy air So swayed she; and back streamed her long white hair. A change—she stood. She who her whole life long Had lived the soft and silent life of flowers Pleased with the beam, patient of rain and wrong, Had held, unconscious all those years and hours A fire within hidden 'neath ashes frore: It rose—to speak but once, and spake no more. It spake reproach: ‘Ah me! thy Sire and I Sought thee while near thou lay'st, but vainly sought, Likewise a household slave right ruthlessly Smote thee at seasons: thou didst answer nought: Thou didst not stanch our tears! O Son, O Son! Make answer from the dead, was this well done?’ Last, with firm foot drew near the one-day Wife, And looked on him, and said: ‘I know that face! Dead is the hope that cheered the widow's life: 'Tis time the Wife her Husband should embrace!’ She spake, and sank in swoon upon his breast, And in that swoon her heart—then first—had rest. But by the Dead still stood Pope Innocent; His deacons placed the mitre on his head; And on his pastoral staff the old man leant: Upon that throng his eye he fixed, and said, ‘Henceforth I interdict all tears. A Saint Lies here. Insult not such with grief or plaint. ‘This man was God's Elect; for from a child He walked God's prophet in an age impure: Ye knew him, sirs, harmless and undefiled He nothing preached. To act and to endure, To live in God's light hid, unknown to die— This task was his. He wrought it faithfully. ‘This man a great work wrought: its greatness fills True measure since His Work Who still divides To each man severally as He wills; He common souls in common courses guides: To some He points strange paths till then untrod: This thing had been ill-done had it not come from God. ‘Behold! He spreads the smooth and level way And blesses those that walk there pure and lowly: Behold! He calls, “Ascend My hill, and pray, And holy be ye for your God is holy: Let each man hear My Voice and heed My Call: For what I give to each I give for all.”’ He spake, and ceased. Then lo! an angel strain At first breathed softly round that straw-laid bed Swelled through those halls: and with it mingled plain That voice so loved of him so lately dead Then when, a child, he breathed that vesper hymn ‘Salve, Regina,’ through the twilight dim. Again and yet again that strain ascended; And in it, sweeter each time than before, The child-voice with the angelic met and blended; The courts, the garden bowers were flooded o'er, Till sorrow seemed to all some time-worn fable, As when, to lull sick babes, old nurses babble. It ceased. The Emperors gave command and straight Men stretched the Dead upon a golden bier For kings ordained and passed the palace gate And laid him in a church to all men dear; And lo! that night blind men who near him prayed Made whole, gave thanks, departing without aid. But in that palace where their Saint was born Till death his parents, sad no more, abode; And, yearly as recurred her marriage morn, His wife put on her wedding-dress, and showed A paler, tenderer reflex, many said, Of what she looked the morning she was wed. Serving their God—all lame half-service past— Serving their God, and, in their God, His poor, They lived; and God, Whose best gift is His last, Suffered not these that anguish to endure Worn patriots feel watching their land's decay: Ere Rome had fall'n they died—on the same day. Euphemian's latest act had given command To raise where stood his Fathers' house in pride A church to God. This day that church doth stand Honouring the spot whereon his dearest died Of that huge house remains that stony stair Alone, which roofed the dying lion's lair. The Romans bring their infants to that spot; Young children peer therein, then shrink away Between those columned ranges twain that blot With evening shades the glistening pavements grey; And oft the latest lingerer drops a tear For those so sternly tried, and yet so dear. But ever while the bells salute that morn When from the darksome womb of mortal life Their Saint into the heavenly realm was born, Old Aventine with bannered throngs is rife; They mount o'er ruins where the great courts stood: They mark old Tiber, now a shipless flood. They reach the church. Star-bright the Altar stands The Benediction Hymn ascends once more: Nearer they gather: Apostolic hands Uplift the Eternal Victim: all adore. The world without is nought: within that fane Abide the things that are and that remain. There still thou livest, Alexis! livest for ever There and in heaven, rooted in endless peace— Thou, and those Three—like trees beside a river That clothe each year their boughs with fresh increase Of flower and fruit embalming airs divine: In that high realm forget not me and mine! SAINT AGATHA. (DIED A.D. 251.) I Dark as ministers of Hell The gaolers strode the Maid beside: Light from heaven upon her fell As she raised her face and cried ‘Lo, my Jesus, all I am Give I freely unto Thee: Guard from harm Thy little lamb: Quell the demon brood through me.’ II Dark the Præter sat, his hand Pointing to the statued gods: Round his throne the lictor band Reared their axes and their rods. ‘Sacrifice!’ the concourse cried: ‘Sacrifice, and thou art free:’ ‘Christ I serve,’ the Maid replied; ‘That is Life and Liberty.’ III They led her to the haunts of shame: Sin was shamed; and Satan fled: They stretched her on a couch of flame: 'Twas to her a rose-strewn bed. Blissful martyr! loud she cried ‘Glory be, my Christ, to Thee! Teach Thou well Thy little bride Patience, Love, and Purity.’ IV It was midnight, and the Maid Robed from breast to foot in blood Stood with hands outstretched, and prayed:— One she saw not near her stood. Fell the Apostolic Light Where had fallen the Pagan sword: Beams of healing smote with might Her bleeding bosom, and restored. V Blest Palermo! Lullabied Was the babe by thy blue sea! Catana more blest! she died Dowered with palm and crown in thee! Share with us your double boast Happy land, for poor are we: Plead, among the heavenly host, Agatha, for mine and me. SAINT LUCY. (DIED A.D. 304.) I ‘O Light divine, those outward eyes That languish, nothing seeing Save thine inferior suns and skies, Blot wholly from my being; But grant me one short hour to see What Anna saw, and Stephen— The Babe upon His Mother's knee; The Saviour crowned in Heaven. II ‘O heavenly, uncreated Word, That took'st our mortal nature, And, still on high as God adored, Didst die on earth, a Creature; We die because we may not die:— Each act, word, thought, betrays Thee: But Thy good Martyrs in the sky And where they suffered, praise Thee!’ III Thus sang Saint Lucy, bright like day, Where others hoped not, hoping; To thy worn tomb, O Agatha, A mother's footsteps propping. She knelt and prayed the Martyr's aid— ‘My mother! help her, shield her!’ ‘Why ask my aid?’ the Martyr Maid Replied; ‘Thy prayers have healed her.’ IV She rose: her country's gods defied; Idol and altar spurning: To death adjudged, with tenderest pride Her cheek, late pale, was burning:— A thousand men their strength put forth: Nor man nor beast might move her! The hand that made the heavens and earth Lay strong that hour above her. V Round her they piled the wood: the fires Forth flashed, and fiercely mounted; She, like a bird 'mid golden wires, The praise of God recounted. ‘The Empire falls: the Church is free!’ So rang her song, and ended ‘O Agatha! for Sicily Henceforth our prayers are blended.’ VI Sicilian sisters fair and brave In bonds of God close-plighted, That, like two lilies on one wave, Float, evermore united; Upheaved upon the Church's breast In aspiration endless Plead from the bosom of your rest For exiled souls and friendless! SAINT ANASTASIA AT AQUILEIA. (DIED A.D. 304.) I Ocean, anew creating Old harmonies; Ether, star-germinating While daylight dies; Sunset, but lately firing The city towers, and still In crimson flame expiring On yonder snow-capped hill: Far peaks, and cliffs that shiver In golden mist, henceforth O lure no more forever My spirit back to earth! II Moored is at last our galley: Our pilgrimage is o'er: But not for us yon valley; And not for us that shore! The cymbals from the city Shake the water like a breath— Chant we in turn one ditty, O Martyr Maids, ere death! O people, who can teach thee That joy to earth unknown? O Saviour, who can preach Thee?— Not words, but death alone! III Mother! Ah, twice, my mother, Thou gav'st me Christ! This day I thank thee, and that other My childhood's staff and stay. How oft when trial pressed me And earthly hope was none, That more than father blessed me And said, ‘Poor child, strive on.’ He prayed for me; he cherished: He gained me strength to win: Through him the tyrant perished That tempted me to sin. IV Like a Seraph in its fleetness My life above me flew: Its sorrow past, its sweetness Falls back on me as dew. Again I tread the prison; I bring the Christians bread: They have raised their heads: they listen: Sweet souls, ye know my tread! The children hide their faces In an unmaternal breast: And, warmed in my embraces, Young mothers, too, find rest. V Once more, the Forum pacing Its temples I behold, As they stand the sun outfacing With their marble and their gold: I scorn them:—I am taken:— I am judged to death once more: Half-famished I awaken On the cold, dark dungeon floor. Chrysogonus! thou hast taught me Once more to kiss my chain: Theodora! thou hast brought me Celestial food again! VI 'Tis past. The dream is over, And the life that does but seem: They are past; and I discover The World too is a dream. Its meaning, its consistence From a higher world is caught; Thy Will is its subsistence; Its order is Thy Thought. Thou hast made it: it arrays Thee: Yet it cannot fill man's heart:— For what Thou art I praise Thee: And I praise Thee that Thou art. VII Entering his own Creation True God true man became. Who wrought the world's salvation? ‘Reedemer’ is His Name. For each man death He tasted: He died that Death might die: Three days entombed He rested: He rose into the sky. Ne'er watched I spring flower waking From its grave beneath the sod But I saw that tombstone breaking, And that Form ascend to God. VIII How oft in youthful slumber I saw all words ascend: Unmeasured, without number, Still up they seemed to tend! Like angels interwoven Up passed the shining choir Through the black vault o'er them cloven: And higher rose and higher. Creation seemed a fountain Sun-changed to heavenward mist: But I knew the parent mountain Was God; the sun was Christ. IX As one that, gold refining, Bends o'er the metal base Till, purged by fire, and shining It shews at last his face, So God oft saw I clearing By pain man's race from sin Till—the perfect mirror sphering— He, imaged, shone therein! The city stays its revels: The minstrel bands retire: No sound o'er the sea-levels: No light, save yonder pyre! X O wind, once more thou playest With the palm-grove near the bay Low words to us thou sayest Of palms that live for aye. That veil the ocean dimming Brings the world of stars more near: And the anthem they are hymning In my spirit I can hear. They sing, ‘Of dust partaker Our wondrous world must die: But our Master and our Maker Lives on eternally.’ THE FEAST OF ST. PETER'S CHAINS. (A.D. 438.) I Her crown is bright with many a gem; But costlier far each tear that glides Down that pale cheek. Jerusalem! She weeps as up thy steep she rides. Before their empress, The Empress Eudocia. gifts they shower: One only to her heart is pressed: An iron chain. In Herod's hour It bound the Apostle ever blest! II The beauteous vision melts in gloom— What lights are those that pierce yon shade? One walks, the mitred sire of Rome: Beside him moves a crownèd Maid. Eudoxia, daughter of the Empress Eudocia. Mamurtine prison! In Nero's reign O'er Peter's head thy shade was thrown:— They kneel; and, kneeling, kiss the chain hat bound him to his couch of stone. III That Roman, that Judean bond United then, dispart no more— Pierce through the veil: the rind beyond Lies hid the legend's deeper lore. Therein the mystery lies expressed Of Power transferred, yet ever one; Of Rome—the Salem of the West— Of Sion built o'er Babylon. IV A city set upon a hill Whoe'er has eyes may turn and see: Through thee the Church is visible; Made visible by Unity! The ‘Pillar and the Ground of Truth’— Through thee she speaks what all may hear: Peter! to hear and hearken, both Were hard indeed wert thou not near! V Through thee her Mysteries high and sweet The Church with History weds, and Fact; Through thee the shocks of Time can meet; Through thee can witness, and can act. Bind round the Church thy sacred Chains!— The electric life that feeds her heart Flashing through them, her iron veins, Makes thus the whole sustain the part. VI Droop but a branch, to natural blight Subjected, or the storms of men, Through thee, sent forth like life and light, Health flows into that branch again. Through thee that strength the world hath missed The Church renews while ages flee: Her inward Unity is Christ; Her outward, Christ set forth in thee. SAINT PERPETUA. (DIED A.D. 203.) Silence, ye crowds! how dare ye thus make start An infant feeding at its mother's breast, Feeding on sacred food and sacred rest? Vain are your cries, your pity vain. Depart! But ye, dread masters in death's fatal art, Torturers! remain: and try, though shame-opprest, Once more your skill; fulfil the dread behest: Her head ye shall not bow nor shake her heart. The Lady's eyes alternately were bent On Heaven and on her child; a grave, sweet smile Tenderly circling her pale lips the while; Until at last the infant was content: Then drooped her lids, and sighing o'er his sigh The mother's spirit sought its native sky. SAINTS VALERIAN AND CECILIA. (DIED A.D. 230.) The eyes that loved me were upon me staying: The eyes that loved me, and the eyes that won: Guardian or guide celestial saw I none; But the unseen chaplets on her temples weighing Breathed heaven around! A golden smile was playing O'er the full lips. Meekly her countenance shone, And beamed, a lamp of peace 'mid shadows dun— Round her lit form the ambrosial locks were swaying. Fair Spirit! Angel of delight new-born And love, unchanging love and infinite, Aurorean planet of the eternal morn! That gaze I caught; and, standing in that light, My soul, from Pagan bonds released by thee, Upsoared, and hailed its immortality. SAINT EMMELIA. Her Convents on the Iris in Pontus. Not for thy snowy peaks, thy woods that wave Where rolls thine Iris on in swift career; Not for thy mountain floods that downward rave; Thy river-breadths shattered o'er ledges sheer; Not for the gems thy myriad streams that pave; Not for roe-haunted glade or shadowed mere; Not for green lawn, blue gorge, or ivied cave; 'Tis not for these that Christians hold thee dear, Thou Pontic Paradise! In Pagan days Beauty was thrall to Pleasure or to Pride: Earth's beauty here Emmelia sanctified Teaching wild wastes to sing their Maker's praise; Here first her Basil taught his Rule astere; Asia's monastic life was rooted here. Her domestic life by the Halys in Cappadocia. The Halys to the Iris whispers low: ‘Thy Saint—Emmelia—came to me a Bride; Each morn, my waving lily beds beside, Knelt with her lord, then strayed with footsteps slow: Amid my flowers I saw her flowers up-grow— Her babes—I bathed them in my crystal tide, I that through flowery meads delight to glide Though born, like thee, among the thrones of snow.’ Than Iris answers: ‘Yea, and Saint not less Was my Emmelia when she walked with thee Than cloistered in my mountains. Saintliness, Ascending, mounts by order and degree; From thee and me alike our Saint is passed:— In thee the flower, in me the star was glassed.’ THE ALEXANDRIAN VERSION OF THE SCRIPTURES. Beside a little humble Oratory There sat a noble lady all alone: Over her knees a parchment lay, whereon Her slender fingers traced our Gospel story. Old Nile flowed noiseless by: through vapours dun A low-hung moon let forth its last faint glory On all the dark green flats, and temples hoary, That grey and ghostly through the morning shone. Thecla! Mankind will ne'er forget that zeal Which, ere the night-bird stays her melody, Raises thee daily to the Church's needs: No doubts, no fears hast thou—thou dost not feel The cold, damp winds of morning as they sigh, Murmuring forlorn through leagues of murmuring reeds! SAINT LEO THE GREAT. (ATTILA BEFORE ROME, A.D. 452.) Leaguering doomed walls—as when on some wild coast The high-ridged deep, storm-drifted from afar, Makes way in thunder, whitening reef and bar, Leaguering great Rome, the old world's shame yet boast, Comes up at last that dread Barbarian host:— To meet them, placid as that morning star Whose rising quells the elemental war Forth moves, his hands upon his bosom crossed, That Puissance new, the Church's mitred Sire! His eye is fixed: as reeds before the breeze Bending, that host sinks down on suppliant knees: The standards droop: the trumpet blasts expire: The Man of Fate in heaven his sentence sees; The embattled Gentiles tremble and retire. EUSTOCHIUM, OR SAINT JEROME'S LETTER. (A.D. 382.) ARGUMENT. Saint Jerome, after his earlier sojourn in the desert of Chalcis and the Holy Land, made abode at Rome, where many enemies waged war against him by reason of the zeal with which he denounced abuses. Notwithstanding, Pope Damasus honoured him, and made him the spiritual director of certain noble Roman ladies, especially Marcella, who had changed her palace into a convent, Paula a young widow, her daughters Eustochium and Blesilla, and others who ennobled yet more the greatest families of ancient Rome by heroic exercise of the Christian virtues. The Saint had written to Eustochium, then a young girl, his celebrated letter concerning Christian Perfection. In return the Girl sent to him three lines and three presents. A man so great to one so slight, so small! Mother! this letter 'twixt my hands high held— I dreamed of it all night; I dreamed a star Shone ever on the scroll—this precious letter Is full of wisdom as the spring of flowers; Full as your eyes are full of beams and tears At times, upon me gazing; as your lips Are full of sweetness closing upon mine. How gently bends this seer to teach a child! I grow to something better. Once I wept When from the Catacombs they fetched triumphant Some new-found vial red with Martyr's blood: This day I fain would share such death! What wonder? Ere speech was mine you vowed for me a vow That never sin should stain that chrisom-robe Which pledged your babe to Christ. Maidens each night Wear garb as white!—you see how glitters mine Touched by the rising sun. The vow you made Each morning I renew. That anchoret grave Was bound by sterner rule. His hair is grey; His forehead seamed and weather-worn; his hand Rough as that desert's tawniest tract; and yet How tenderly it writes! ‘She sold her gems; To the poor she gave their price. Her festal robes She changed for cloak of penitential brown: One narrow cell to her was paradise: At night she glided to the Martyrs' tombs; There knelt in prayer till morning. In that mien Severity was blithesome, blithesomeness A thing severe. How tender was that face! Its paleness meant detachment from this world, Converse with heaven. Her speech was soft as silence: Her silence sweet as music.’ Thus he ends: ‘Let her not see this letter: praise disturbs her! Show it to Pagans.’ Sternly he writes of these: ‘Shun thou those Pagan maids who, serpent-like, Shoot out from creviced chinks of rock a crest That shines but to betray; and shun not less Those worldlings that usurp the Christian name Yet, Pagans still at heart, stretch fearless forth A full-fed, gem-lit, sacrilegious hand Even to the sacred chalice! Shun those widows Shrill-voiced because some Consul of their kin Rode up three centuries since to the Capitol Dragged by the snow-white steeds. Predestinate race! That golden-gated Capitol is void! Trembles the seven-hilled city! Suppliant throngs Rush on by vacant temples of the gods, Rush to the Martyrs' graves.’ Forgive me, mother! Back blew the casement, and rose-scented airs Ruffled the pages. Thus once more he writes: ‘Forget thy kinsfolk and thy Father's house, And live in Christ reborn! The bridal Rite Is venerable, holy the marriage bed; But high above the level of things good Things better rise—things best. In olden time Command went forth, “Behold, a man shall leave Father and mother, cleaving to his wife;” But lo! a lordlier challenge greets us now: “Soul by God's Hand created unto God For His sake count as dross all lesser things So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty.” Unworthy art thou? Such unworthiness Is worth with God. He, choosing from all lands, Elects the Ethiopian, bids her sing, “Dark am I, dark yet fair.”’ Mother, methinks I scarce had liked that praise of convent life Save that he speaks with reverence too of marriage: The life of nuns must be a kind of marriage, Marriage to One unseen. He writes once more: ‘In the old time blest was he whose field was rich, Whose flocks were large; the poor are blessed this day: Blessed of old who laughed; to-day who weep: Blessed of old the man whom all men praised; Blessed this day who walks despised by all: Blessed of old the man who stood secure Palm-like beside still waters; blessed now The Runner in God's race. In ancient time Blessed that Hebrew maiden changed to wife; Her babe might prove the Christ. Now Christ is come: In sorrow Eve brough forth: Mary in joy: Virginity brought forth not death but life, The Lord of Life, and won thenceforth for Woman The restful hymeneals of the skies. Our loves are loftier than of old, our wars Sublimer; not with flesh and blood we strive, But Princes of the Darkness of this world: God calls thee, not to heights, but to the highest: Preserve God's sanctuary. The Ark of old Held these two things, the Tables of the Law; Held these and naught besides.’ Mother, my Mother! How dear to this high Teacher she had been, That Girl, the glory of Rome's earlier day, Virginia! Ofttimes I have seen her face Clearly as now yon apple-tree dew-bright! O chaste as all the Vestals, with what joy She met her father's knife! Unstained, untouched, She reached the mansions of the holy Dead That flocked to her as doves to haunts well known. Christians there lived that never heard of Christ, Baptized perhaps by Powers unseen! Our Master Writes sternly: ‘Touch not thou a Pagan book: Stand not anear it, lest a demon leap Forth from gilt page, and light upon thy heart: For their sake penance nigh to death was mine.’ Mother, where sweetness is must needs be goodness: All other Pagan legends may be false; That Maid's I know is true! Our Master spurned Not Pagan books alone; he left, he fled The lands they boast. ‘Hail, holy Waste,’ he writes, ‘Bare, yet enamelled with the flowers of Christ! Hail, Solitude immeasurable! to thee We fly, not shunning aught but seeking all: Thy Face we seek, Thou conqueror who o'ercam'st The Tempter in the desert! Worldly toys Here rise not 'twixt our spirits, Lord, and Thee: We see Thee tread Thy loved Judean fields Helping the sick, the blind; and hear Thy voice, These words, “Her sins, though many, are forgiven,” Or those of kindred tone, “Lazarus, arise!” Far off we ken the City of Thy Saints And gates of sunset gold.’ Yet through that waste Portents there roamed which shook our Master's spirit, soul, Temptations we can guess not, spared, no doubt, To ill-resisting weakness. Burning sands Drank up those flaming suns and sent their glow On through his body and soul. Whole days, whole nights He beat his breast at some cold cavern's mouth, Fled thence to deserts lonelier. Lion and pard, Or demon-foes imaged in dreadful shapes, I trembled here too much to understand, Passed him fire-eyed. Benigner visions soon Healed his tired being with assuaging light, Memories, it may be, of yon Alban hills Or choirs dance-woven of Rome's young, fair maids; And when that storm had left him angels sang, ‘We follow where thou goest.’ Mother beloved! I should not read you more. You kept, last night, Long vigil: leaning now 'gainst yonder stone Your head, your eyes alternate flash and close; And sometimes ere the smile has left your lips A momentary sleep sits on your lids. Hear but one passage more: ‘Humility Learn from humiliations; these are sent To spare us degradations ours through pride: Be humble thou; yet boast not humbleness: Be ignorant rather than, through knowledge, vain. Then when the trial finds thee, as a seal Let Christ be on thy heart and on thine arm; Walk on: fear naught: pure foot shall tread secure Adder and serpent's crest.’ Again he writes: ‘What! Wouldst thou tread the lilies only? Nay, But paths empurpled by the Feet divine, And daily ways of death.’ I think—I doubt not— Our stern, rough Teacher had a sister once! He knows that praise, though undeserved, alas! Helps girls to merit praise. Again he writes, ‘Give thyself wholly to the Lord of all: Wholly for thee He died. What wife would couch On silks while bleeding lies her warrior Lord On snows far distant? Shun the festal haunts: The Spouse of souls is near thee: seek Him not In crowded ways. The watchers of the night Will meet thee there, and rend from thee thy veil: Pray thou within: He stands without and knocks: Then when thou hear'st “My sister and my spouse,” Fling wide thy door, or soon thy song shall be, “I opened: He had passed! Yea, lightning-like He passeth; and His footsteps are not known.”’ Thus he concludes: ‘The Mother of thy God Make still thy pattern; in thy heart of hearts Thus shall her Babe be born. She, she alone, The Inviolate One, was fruitful in herself, Parent—sole parent—of Incarnate God, In this an image of the Eternal Sire Parent, sole Parent of the Eternal Son. The stem is she from Jesse; He the flower That, burgeoning from that stem, satiates with sweet Both heaven and earth. The soul that inly loves her Should be God's night-bird singing all night long With bleeding beak the Passion of her Son. What are the voices of the earth beside? Wouldst hear His Voice? Be wise in sacred lore: Read well God's Book, to noble hearts how dear! It is God's Eden: yea, He walks therein In the coolness of the day. What find we there? The record of the Making of all worlds; The record of Deliverance for His People; The record of the giving of His Law On Sinai amid thunders: after these Soarings of regal or of priestly psalm, Next, warnings of sad seers from Carmel's steeps, Or moanings of that far, prophetic sea Wide as man's heart, that, heaved by breath divine, Yearns round the bases of the Mount of God With groans unutterable. Later came That second Tome—the Four Evangelists: There lives, fire-breathing like the stars of God, There lives that vision of the Creatures Four Seen by Ezekiel! Full of wings and eyes, Man-faced yet lion-faced and eagle-faced, Forward they rush yoked to a fiery car; Forward they rush where'er the Spirit wills; Yea, for the self-same Spirit is in those wheels. Throned in that car, above God's hills for ever On sweeps the Son of Man.’ O mother mine! I read, unweeting how the moments passed, And louder read as yonder garden choir That first but piped, each bird a note, then slept, Rewakening shook the blossoming boughs, as though God loved no praise but theirs! The ascended sun Shoots o'er the pavement now a longer beam, A warmth how grateful, for the unsandalled foot Chills soon upon these marbles. Why, O why Hate men our Master? Fierce in fight they call him: Methinks there might be wars with mildness blent; They say that turtles fight, and yet, one dead, Its little mate heart-stricken dies of grief. What know I? Mother, you have heard his letter: Needs must I write my thanks upon my knees? And yet not thus: my tears might blot the page; And ‘keep,’ he said, ‘in youth thy tears for God: Drop them in age for man—less dangerous then.’ I must write gaily lest my scroll prove irksome: I must write briefly for he ends, ‘Few words! Mine hours with tasks are laden.’ Hark that chime Rolled from St. Peter's! 'Tis Saint Peter's Day! Listen! Again that rush of countless feet! All Rome makes speed to greet her great Apostle! Hasten we, too:—my letter first: 'tis writ! Irené, take these tablets to my Master: These lines—there are but three—may win his smile: Likewise these presents three; the Armillœ first, War-bracelets clasping none but conquering arms: Doubtless some warrior of our house, long dead, Won them by merit. Heavier blows by far This athlete of God's Church hath dealt her foes, Too fiercely dealt them Roman priests aver; But then they fear his haughty strength and looks Still heated from the desert. Give him next These two young doves so loving and so mild; And, last, this basket heaped with early cherries. The hour he sat here first I gave him such! Three years have passed since then. Smiling he spake ‘The gift is meet: cherries, like little maids, Are fresh and pure; a blushful gleam without; Hard heart within.’ I think he will remember! THE DEATH OF SAINT JEROME. (A.D. 420.) ARGUMENT. After many years spent on his translation of the Sacred Scriptures into Latin, and the introduction of the Eastern Monasticism into the West, Saint Jerome returned to Jerusalem. In Bethlehem that great warrior of the Faith died. He had lived a man of controversies and of labours, of wanderings and of solitudes, of stern resentments, of impassioned friendships, and of sore griefs, the sorest of which was that caused by the fall of Rome beneath the sword of Alaric—although he saw in that fall a righteous retribution. Saint Jerome had loved Rome with a vehement and faithful, though not with a servile, love. His death-bed at Bethlehem was solaced by the filial devotion of the ‘Second Paula,’ the grand-daughter of the ‘Earlier Paula’ and the niece of Eustochium, both of whom had died at Bethlehem. A woful night! My sleep was storm not rest: The death-cry of great Rome rang over it. Ten years are past; yet still I hear that cry, And loudest oft in sleep. Who comes? 'Tis Paula! I know that voice; I know that hand. In mine The hot, hard bones and ropy veins grow cool Touched by its snows. Paula! I see thee not: Mine eyes are dazzled by the matin beam: Those Hebrew scrolls, those characters minute Have somewhat tasked them. All night long in fire They glared upon me. ‘Sedet Civitas’— Incipit Jeremiæ Lamentatio: ‘Lo, solitary sitteth now the City:’— As dead men in the streets, so lie her sons. I dictated in dream: I dreamed my scribe Dropped on the parchment down his youthful head; I laid my hand thereon and sent him forth With blessing to his couch. His rest was sweet: But I—my bed is watered with my tears, For night by night I hear the self-same cry, ‘Esuriunt Parvuli: the suckling's tongue Cleaves to the small roof of the suckling's mouth Because his drought is sore.’ That Hebrew Seer Lamented Salem's downfall. Rome, great Rome! I that rebuked thy wanderings was thy son. Dalmatia called me by that name: I heard; But, even in childhood, standing by her waves, And gazing on her mountains near the sea For me my Rome beyond them rose, seven-hilled Fane-crowned. I cried, ‘My Mother!’ Fling it wide Yon casement! Let the sea-breeze cool my brow! No, not sea-breeze; this is not Aquileia Where lived Crostatius and Eusebius, mine; I left my young, sad sister in their charge— Was that well done? I know not; ne'er shall know— Then passed alone to Chalcis 'mid the sands: It was a fiery prison to the sense, A Patmos to the soul. Let in the breeze! There died my dearest then upon the earth, Hylas and Innocentius. Still at times— Thanks, Paula, thanks! Hail, pure reviving airs They waft me healing memories. Once again O child, I read the tidings of thy birth By Leta sent to Paula here recluse. ‘The child of all thy prayers is ours at last! Mother, thy name shall be our infant's name, A younger Paula pledged before her birth To live like thee the handmaid of the Lord, With thee and thy Eustochium, my sweet sister.’ I wrote in turn: ‘Leta, I share thy joy: Train up thy child to God: her little hands, When first they travel o'er her mother's face In wondering love, press thou upon those letters Ivory or ebon, spelling God's great name: Let Halleluiahs be her earliest song: See she be humbly clad and tend God's poor: When womanhood draws near her, but ere yet Childhood has left her, send her to this spot That, kneeling where the cradled Child-God slept She learn His service. I will be her Teacher. She shall be worthy of her Roman stock.’ O holy, sweet, and gracious Company! O Household dear to God! Their feet to us Who trod this vale of tears were beautiful Upon the mountains: for where'er they moved 'Twas mountain land, God's Gospel lit their brows And flashed it thence to men. I had dwelt five years Alone in deserts lodged 'mid ravening beasts; And when I saw man's face once more therein Ferine was mixed with human, though in some There lived a wild rude beauty. Back to Rome I passed: I found not in her what my youth Half-spurned, yet half-admired. The Prince of Peace Held there a place that feared to claim its own: The spoils and trophies of a thousand wars Bade it defiance. Palsy-stricken long The old Pagan Rite lifted a brow still crowned, A sceptred hand, though shaking. Proud in death Like Rome's old emperor it ‘stood up to die:’ Well-nigh two hundred temples laughed in scorn From summits seven. The Imperial name survived, But trod as men in cities earthquake-jarred; Authority, Tradition still survived: The dignity of these things was gone by: To shameless spectacles the people rushed: The gloom of wearied lusts was in their eyes: The Coliseum's blood-stained sports, though dead Left dark their foreheads. Sweet as music-strain Dawned on me then that vision strong and fair Of Romans true at once to ancient times And loyal to God's truth. Heroic Houses, The great patrician races of old Rome, The Anician, Claudian, Fabian, yea the Scipios', Before me stood, but consecrate to Christ: Dead virtues lived again, but in the spirit. A great thing is Nobility in death: Those Christian nobles' soul had found a land Worthier than that for which Attilus died— God's Church. The hearth had won its rights. True wives Like Lucrece or like Portia, statelier mothers Than she whose son captured Corioli Or she that reared the Gracchi, stood once more In Christian Rome. Senators oft were Christian And, garbed in peasant's cloak of homely brown, Filled with God's poor the palace of their sires: ‘Rome is forgiven!’ I cried; ‘the wrong is past: The blood that cried for vengeance cries no more: Maro's old vision of a realm world-wide Which only smote the proud to raise the weak Shall find at last fulfilment.’ Woe is me! I saw but half. The many were the bad: the good were few. Vainly God's Prophets thundered 'gainst the crime, Fate trod behind it close. My lips are parched: How fresh that water! Thanks! Holiest and best Of all those holy ones to me so dear Thy father's mother was—that earlier Paula: Beside a daughter's grave I saw her first: The trials others shunned to her grew dear; They brought her near the Man of Woes. Her mind Was all of ardours and of soarings made, Winged like the Greek; unlike it soft and sacred: Greek she knew well; Hebrew she learned ere long: She thirsted for that land the Saviour trod And thither fled. From North to South she tried it, Then chose this site and here her convents raised: She ruled them twenty years, then slept in Christ. In death she lay as one restored to youth The while close by great Prelates of the East Bishops and priests chanted her requiem psalms, And o'er the bier one black-robed mourner lay; Her lips were on her mother's brow, her face Hid on that mother's bosom. In a cave Close to that spot where stood the Sacred Crib We laid the Dead, expectant of that day When God shall raise her. On the rock hard by I graved her name and lineage: ‘Here in Christ Paula finds rest. The great Emilian race, Cornelia's blood, the Scipios, and the Gracchi In her lay down the pride of ancient Rome Before the cradle of Incarnate God. She was Eustochium's mother. All, save her, She left to worship here.’ Eustochium's mother! Eustochium—those who looked upon her face Believed perforce. Amid the virgin choir She stood, men said, Virginity itself: They thanked her less for all of good she taught them Than all her presence slew. The shames of life Vanished, and memory's book laughed out in light: Lethè ran o'er it. Paula wept at times; Her child shone out as from the weeping cloud The all-radiant arch. In her the Virtues Three Began with Hope—for what is Hope but Faith Mounted on wings?—passed on to Charity, And ended in some grace to man unknown. A child she wrote me letters, sportive, brief, Yet serious 'neath her sport. Childhood in her Lived till her mother died. She too is dead! That whole great race hath passed from earth away: Pammachius, of Camillus' mighty line, And Leta and Toxotius. All are gone! When died the last I registered a vow: I vowed their names should live till mine had perished. Those names are wedded with that Tome which clasps My life's long labour. It is gone, that life; Yon sun new-risen is my latest sun: Be near me, child! Thank God, another Paula Remains to close my eyes. As death draws nigh, Peace-maker best, men turn to those who made Their peace on earth. Mine was a life of wars; Was that my fault? I know not. Roman half, Barbaric half, I was not made for peace; My blood rushed fiercely as Dalmatian floods When thunder shakes our hills. I knew in youth A house among those hills; on stillest days Close round it reeled a tempest of its own, Whirlwind of confluent winds whose course was shaped By distant mountains. Like that house was I. Strange hands remote had shaped me unto storm: Storm sang the dusky matins of my life; Storm sang my vesper psalms. Others have fled To wastes in search of peace: I, late baptized, Rushed there to war on fiends whose Chief had warred Upon my Chief in the great wilderness. Five years we battled. Victory doubtful seemed: God spake; then ceased the winds, and fell the waves, And there was a great calm. New foes succeeded, Foes from Christ's household, anchorets of the East That ground their teeth against me. ‘Ho,’ they cried, ‘Impostor of the Gentile world far West, Tread'st thou our East?’ Then shook I from my feet The burning sands in testimony against them: I passed to Antioch; to Byzantium next Better so called than by his arrogant name Who made God's church an appanage! Next I saw That great Thebais and its hermit sons, And wrote their deeds. At Rome Pope Damasus Loved me; his Saints too loved me. All the more They hated me without a cause, those priests, Ill-tonsured heads, obsequious; men who trod The rich man's floors whispering his leech, and eyed Askance the miser's will. I pointed 'gainst them This finger now so stark. Ascetics false; Solitaries whom envy not their fasts made lean; And, noisomer culprits, priests that ate from gold, That, sinning with the people sinned against them, That prophesied illusions and deceits And therefore won no Vision from the Lord: On such I hurled God's bolts. Erred I in this? My Mother said of me, ‘His hand is hard, Not so his heart.’ The boy was hard; the man. My chief of battles was with Origen, That Greek whose airy fancies, unbaptized Save in Castalian springs, if spared had changed The solid lands and seas of Christian Faith To mist of allegory. Rufinus next— Ah, false, false friend! He walked with me in youth: In age with parricidal hand he wrote That book against God's Church. With him he drew Salem's unholy bishop, Barnabas; Later, by night that base Pelagian crew Full fain had burned me in my monastery Whose site, foreseeing, I had chosen for strength. I shook this hand against them from its roofs, Then 'scaped to yonder tower. How unlike these That youthful priest, angelic more than priestly, Nepotian! Standing in the imperial court He wore the hair-cloth hid. A soldier once A soldier's simpleness was in him ever; He was the outcast's help, the orphan's hope, The strength of all the oppressed. Like pure, cold airs Launched from white peaks on one that tracks hot sands The casual thought of him had power to cheer me. Once more I see him with that child-like smile Brightening his grave and sacerdotal stillness; Each holy widow ‘Mother’ still he called, Each maiden ‘Sister.’ With what care he clothed His own high thoughts in garb of teachers old: ‘Saint Irenæus; Cyprian hints—’ Shunning all self-assertion! Ah! great God! That lily, which the right hand of Thy pureness Had shaped to be an image of itself, Struck by the noontide ardours, drooped, and died! ‘I shall have letters from him soon,’ I mused: A stranger entered, sad of face: he laid A young priest's garment on an old man's knee; He spake: ‘Nepotian sent it thee in death; “Tell him that by God's altar day by day This was my tunic as I ministered.”’ Paula, since then it lies athwart this couch: Spread it above me dead. He died in youth: So best! How fair a thing is youth like his, Summed up and whole, from Innocence to Death Wafted unstained! How beautiful to him Whose age is but a maimed and mangled weight, Whose life a long frustration! Such was mine: They that most hated, they who fain had stoned me, Belike too high esteemed me. All that life Was conflict fierce of random purposes, Poor nothings which the Hand that made all worlds Alone could shape to good. I strove to plant The convents of the East o'er all the West Yet never was at heart a man recluse: I said: ‘No choice is ours: dead Paganism Breathes from its shameful grave a mist that slays: Christians must flee the infected world.’ To me Not high, not pure, a restless spirit ever, Travel world-wide, strong studies, rule of men In these I had large share. My books were acts; I sent them forth to toil. The thoughts heaven-born That, angel-like, dropt by Augustine's tent— I love that man the more for conflicts past— Sought not my cavern. 'Twas against my will They changed me into Priest. Once, and but once, I offered Sacrifice. And yet this hand, So soon to mingle with its native dust, Transferred God's Oracles from tongues long dead To Rome's which cannot die! Was this my praise? Not so; I toiled, at first to shun temptations: The task that lulled my youth brightened mine age: Book after book took shape beneath my hand Not preordained by me. God wrought the work: Through God alone His great Book of the East Shall live the great Book of the West, the world, The Church's Holy Book, which, like that stone Hewn from the mountain, that became a mountain, Shall singly in its majesty make null The books of all the nations, weak like them. This is God's Book: in it the Church of God, While myriad Errors round her rise, shall see Writ as in stars those Truths which in her heart Live ever, seen or veiled:—the Church's sons, Nurtured by it on heavenly food, shall walk Not childish, not imbecile, but as men In lowly strength of Faith. If e'er man's race, Its winter past, shall breathe a second spring, The Letters of the Nations shall not take Their mould from barbarous lands that knew not God, Or lands corrupt which, having known, forsook Him, But Words of God to man. Earth's Homer new, Her Phidias, her Apelles, themes shall choose That change not soul to sense, but sense to soul: That Maccabean Trump for aye shall peal; Ruth glean 'mid western fields. Rebuke shall roll From western Carmels on insurgent kings Who o'er false altars hurl schismatic smoke And filch the poor man's vineyard. Casual texts Shall slay yet make alive; o'er western hearts Sin-seared shall flash those dagger-points of light That say, ‘Thou art the Man.’ The Hebrew Spirit, Yea, though o'er earth the Hebrew race walk bare, Abject, down-trod, priestless and altarless, Shall judge earth's orb secure. Paula, my pledge to thee has been fulfilled: Paula, the End is woe. At last I face it. Child, for thy sake it shall be briefly told. The Goth, the Hun, Vandal, and Marcoman, Successive swept the world. Cloudlike they rushed O'er Scythia, Dacia, Thrace, my own Dalmatia. The flaming churches witnessed their advance: They dragged the old noble from his palace home, The bishop from his flock. They slew the babe That smiled upon their sword. The world's one flower, Athens, they trampled 'neath a bestial hoof: Damascus heard their coming: Antioch fell; Their steeds they watered in Orontes' wave And Halis, and Euphrates. We, not they, Burned this great shame upon the brows of Rome: Man sinned: God's judgment followed. Near me, child! 'Twas in the night the crown of Cities fell. A thousand and a hundred years had passed Since from that Capitolian height arose Earth's throne permitted. Rome, the Queen of Men, Had changed to Queen of slaves. A cry was heard Like cry of wolves that throng dark Dacian hills O'erhanging some doomed village. On the march Of Alaric south, Alaric ‘the Scourge of God,’ Full forty thousand slaves of race barbaric Had joined his standard. Thirty thousand more That night within Rome's fated walls uprose; They burst the Gate Salarian. Paula, nearer! The foe was in the city as a flood: They thronged the Forum first, that Forum girt With idol temples; next that Coliseum Where many a Dacian chieftain, many a Goth, Had gorged the lion's maw. 'Twas there rang out The second cry. That was the cry of Rome— Men say no other followed. O my child! Thy tears which fall so quickly on my hand Warn me to cease. Not all was woe, was shame: Alaric was Christian, and his Goths in part; They spared the maid, the nun; of many great ones Some few were buried in their native soil. Beneath a gloomier vault the Conqueror lies. Alaric's dread task accomplished, on him first Earthly ambition fell. Southward he marched To make a second continent his prey. His Maker smote that proud one that he died. Three days in wrath they mourned him; on the fourth A counsel rose among them. Swift and near A river rushed: they forced a captive host To sluice away its waters. In its bed They built a tomb trophied with spoils of Rome: Therein they laid their mighty One. Once more They rolled that river through its channel old, Then slew that captive host. ‘No man,’ they sware, ‘Shall peer into the secret of the King; None trouble his remains.’ His work was done: No day but o'er the earth the exiles passed, Exiles once Roman princes. Every coast Egyptian, Syrian, Pontic, watched them coming, The old, the young, their purple changed to rags, And followed far with sad, remorseful eyes. The Christians of their number hither flocked; They yearned to die there where their Lord was born. We gave them food at first: when none remained We gave them tears. The haggard phantoms trod Awe-struck, the ways of Sion; by that brook, Cedron, and under groves of Olivet, And Calvary, and beside that garden-cave Where lay the Saviour dead. The sight was strange! These were the children of that Pagan race Which wrought God's vengeance on God's chosen City. Their own had been the secular head of earth, The Salem of the Unjust: their own was judged: And now, like babes on some dead mother's breast, They clung to her whose heart their sires had pierced, Sought there a mother's aid. Ah me! Ah me! Pilate and Caiaphas were one in sin. Salem and Rome! These might have been God's hands Stretched forth in benediction o'er the world: They met—those hands—one blood was on them both! One judgment is on both. There yet remains A ruined fragment huge of Salem's wall: A little Hebrew remnant haunt that spot: They kiss those fissured stones and in their shade Sing their lamenting psalms. How oft hard by Have I not heard our Roman exiles weep! Antiphonal those dirges drear! Methought Each on the other railed reproach: first, Rome, ‘Jerusalem, Jerusalem that slay'st The Prophets:’ next, the Hebrews' fierce retort, ‘Art thou not in the self-same condemnation? Thy House is left unto thee desolate.’ Paula, these things lie heavy on my soul: Last night Rome's judgment dealt with me so sorely I scarcely knew if months or years divide Her death-day from my own. Her ending seemed the ending of a world. If this our earth had in the flat sea sunk Save one black ridge whereon I sat alone, Such wreck had seemed not greater. It was gone, That Empire last, sole heir of all the empires, Their arms, their arts, their letters, and their laws. ‘'Twas in the night the wall of Moab fell’— Ezekiel sang that verse, the man who saw The horrors of Sin's Chambers veiled by night. Gone, too, is David's kingdom, Israel's House: ‘Incipit Jeremiæ Lamentatio:’ ‘How solitary sitteth now that City Which whilome was the joy of all mankind.’ Begins the great lament that end hath none: Then silence; then that dirge predicted long, The welter of that wide barbaric flood Thenceforth earth's sable pall and universal: The fountains of the nether deep are burst: The second deluge comes. And let it come! That God who sits above the water-spouts Remains unshaken. Paula, what is earth? A little bubble trembling ere it breaks, The plaything of that grey-haired infant, Time, Who breaks whate'er He plays with. I was strong: See how He played with me! Am I not broken? Albeit I strove with men of might; albeit Those two great Gregories clasped me, palm to palm; Albeit I fought with beasts at Ephesus And bear their tokens still; albeit the wastes Knew me, and lions fled; albeit this hand Wrinkled and prone hurled to the dust God's scorners, Am I not broken? Lo, this hour I raise High o'er that ruin and wreck of life not less This unsubverted head that bent not ever, And make my great confession ere I die, Since hope I have, though earthly hope no more: And this is my confession: God is great; There is no other greatness; God is good; There is no other goodness. He alone Is true Existence; all beside is dream. Likewise confession make I that His Hand, Which made all worlds, and made them to His glory, Which touches earthly greatness and it dies, Shall touch one day the dead within their graves And lift them to His life. That Death Divine Hath raised mankind above all fates and fortunes. Paula, when thou hast closed these eyes in death And laid this body in this holy land Close by thy kinsfolk whom in life I loved, Record of me, not dangers, labours, triumphs; Record alone that in the day of death Christ was my stay; He only; that on Him, Bending above the imminent grave, I leaned— God's penitent not less than confessor— My total being, body, soul, and spirit, His liegeful servant. Holy is the feast He keepeth; and His Truth remains for aye. STILICHO. (DIED A.D. 408.) ARGUMENT. Stilicho, though a Vandal, had fought from his youth under the Emperor Theodosius the Great, and conceived for Rome a veneration heightened by compassion for her fallen estate. That Emperor's sons having been left in his guardianship, he devoted all his energies and genius to their defence and that of the Empire, and had conceived a scheme for its complete regeneration. When on the point of executing that scheme, he was put to death through the jealousy of the Roman nobles, and the treachery of the Emperor Honorius. A Gothic Chief appears suddenly at a banquet of the Roman nobles. He upbraids them with their falsehood, enumerates the successive occasions on which Stilicho had saved the Empire from destruction, and announces that Alaric is within two days' march of Rome which he has vowed to destroy, and that he himself is issuing forth to Alaric's camp. He departs, no man daring to bar his way. Nobles of Rome—I scorn to call you Romans— Ye bade me to your banquet; I have come, Not therefore trencher-guest. I come to strike A dagger-worded edge of just revenge Far on through treason's heart. My sword—you see it— Too long, like Stilicho's, it served your State— Is snapt in twain. I brake it as I passed Upon the stone neck of that idol Jove Which, ten years prostrate, shames your Capitol. That Capitol whose gates Stilicho shattered, Burning your Sybil's books. I come to tell you That which was writ within that Sybil's books In its last page, unless that Sybil lied. There sit two hundred of you: ye can slay me If my discourse—I think it will—molests you. What then? I shall have told the truth and died. Lords, would ye learn who taught me those two lessons? The man a week since murdered, Stilicho. Lords, let me tell you somewhat of that man By you perchance—a week is long—forgotten: I knew him well and owed him my advancement. Stilicho was my friend: behoves it, sirs, Ye learn his history from first to last; So shall the dead man be his own avenger. That man was Vandal. In late years your Rome Has condescended oft to aid Barbaric: Great Theodosius never marched without him; His counsel on the battle-field was law, His presence inspiration. Victory Dawned on the face of every Roman soldier When came the tidings, ‘Stilicho is near:’ I heard the Emperor say, ‘This Vandal Chief Is Roman of the Romans.’ As he passed A shout rang out, ‘Fabricius,’ or ‘Camillus:’ Never they named him with your later names! In every province he had held command Yet no man taxed him with an ‘itching palm.’ The Emperor linked him with the Imperial House By marriage; dying, placed him o'er his sons, Regent of East and West. Attend and learn: I but record plain facts: these stab the deepest: That Emperor's son, Arcadius, was a lack-wit: Rufinus ruled his realm, the East: this aim Was his, to bring to naught the Western Empire Where reigned Honorius, not through hate of him But hate of Stilicho, the youth's protector. Rufinus was a Gaul, astute and pliant: Rufinus was a traitor. From afar He beckoned to the Hunnish tribes that roamed The Caspian coasts: with Alaric next he trafficked: He placed, in secret, Greece within his grasp: By open pact he throned him in Illyria And pointed thence to Rome. What help was hers? Nobles of Rome, reply! A Man—one Man! Stilicho crossed the Alps alone: alone His hand he lifted upon Rhenus' banks, A hand that raised a standard. Round it flocked The wrecks of ancient Roman legionaries The Gauls, the German tribes late linked with Rome By treaties, first-fruits of his rule sagacious. With these, as with an army from the clouds, He dropp'd on Greece astonished. Alaric fled To far Thessalian hills. He girt him round: In one day more, but one, Alaric had perished: That noon, the assault commanded, rode in sight A horseman by the Eastern Emperor sped, The bearer of a missive: ‘Leave this land: War not on Alaric: Alaric and I are friends. Send back mine Eastern Legions.’ He obeyed: Nobles, ye know his act, but not its sanction: He called to him a Goth, by name Gainus; He gave command; all heard it: none forgot: Stilicho was a man who scorned concealment. ‘Lead thou those legions to the Bosphorus; There slay Rufinus! Slay him with thy hand In the Emperor's sight: in sight of all his people: Rufinus is a traitor prov'n.’ Ere long That Traitor's plot was ripe. That self-same day Which saw the legions of the East return Was chosen to crown Rufinus Emperor. Arcadius and the Upstart sat enthroned With all the nobles of the court around: The legions made advance; Rufinus rose; With that well-known, but seldom trusted smile Their standards he saluted: he began— Gainus smote him through the heart, with shout, ‘From Stilicho! He sent it you for Treasons Prov'n and avowed.’ An Eastern warrior cried, ‘Say not from Stilicho, but Theodosius! The brave old Emperor smote him from the grave!’ Stilicho saved that day your Eastern Empire. Feasters, attend: this matter touches you! Six years went by: the Goths o'erflowed your land: What course was theirs who boast their Rome? They fled! Their roads were choked: their harbours crammed: their galleys Took wing to Corsica and Sicily. Where then was Stilicho? His voice went forth From Rhetia's vales: his Name subdued the indwellers. A Race barbaric saved you: some had served Beneath his standard: some had felt his steel: As though by magic moved they turned and joined him. Your legions breathed again. A man—one man— He stamped upon the earth, and raised two armies! A sudden Apparition he appeared; By miracle of strategy he conquered; He freed Honorius then at Asta sieged: He smote the invaders on Pollentia's field; Later he broke them 'neath Verona's wall— Stilicho saved that day your Western Empire! That night was triumph loud, and mirth, and feast. Yet Stilicho that day had learned a lesson. At night that great one whispered in mine ear ‘Rome might have borne great losses, loss of realms— This blow is Death. Rome fell without a fight! The hand that saved her was the Hand Barbaric: Dishonour means Destruction.’ Years went by; Again he spake, ‘The East is false and hates us. The Roman knows to boast, but not to fight, The Race Barbaric fights no more for hire, It fights, although he knows it not, for Empire. That Western Empire willed not to be saved.’ The terror past, ‘What man is Stilicho?’ Your Pagans asked. ‘To him no God gave help Who sees may learn thus much. His Wife, Serena, Wears still that circlet snatched from Juno's brow!’ Your Christians next; ‘What! Stilicho a Christian! Claudian, his poet, is a pagan vowed: So are his sons' preceptors. If a Christian Why breaks he not the statues of false Gods? The victory was miraculous: 'twas not his!’ Thus raved the inept. The man they scoffed replied not: Lonely he mused on Rome's far destiny By him since youth foreseen: Foreseen it long he had, but not designed it; Events to him unwelcome brought the crisis: He met it prompt, not glad. ‘By Rome,’ he said, ‘Confugiendum ad Imperium est: Till now she ne'er was more than half an Empire.’ But there was greatness in his scheme: and Rome Could rise no more to greatness. Again and yet again that shame recurred. One hope remained. An honourable foe Is better than false friend. Alaric had served Like Stilicho in Theodosius' armies: They knew each other's worth: to each the course Steered by the other was intelligible. The King of Goths, the Regent of the Empire, Had proved—each knew it—faithful to his trust: Rivals they were in youth: war followed war: Stilicho twice drave back the Goths: that done He spared the German blood: the noble foes Changed to true friends. Some Eastern plot detected Stilicho cried; ‘Would God, Alaric and I Might march like brothers to the Bosphorus And drown therein the traitors!’ One who heard Whispered that word to Alaric. Who is Alaric? One swift in love—in hate! Freely he proffered To join his warriors with the Roman force, And to the Roman realm revindicate Gaul and Iberia lost. That task achieved His people were to hold, secure from wrong, Some space unpeopled in the Western Empire Thenceforth its friends. No secret pact was this. When Stilicho discoursed with me thereon Honorius titular Emperor of the West, Praised it, loud-voiced. The youth had late espoused The Regent's daughter, that domestic tie Designed by Theodosius. Secret league! Stilicho loved no secrets. He himself Deliberately divulged it to the Senate: Some loud ones in that Senate stormed and raved. Placid as power no petulance can shake Stilicho rose: at once the tumult ceased: He might have said; ‘For centuries, Senators, Phantoms were ye gibbering in cave and crypt,’ (Methinks I see among you such this hour) ‘'Twas I restored to Rome her buried Senate. This day I give her more; I give her men.’ Not thus he spake: he forced the facts upon them, The West o'errun; Rome powerless to redeem it; The Race Barbaric taught at last their worth; Ye, Romans, signed that league. Rome's Witlings swore ‘That treaty soon must fling the Empire's gates Open alike to Roman and to Goth.’ That was its chief of merits! Stilicho Had faith in Rome her children feel no longer, Faith in her destiny, faith avouched, proclaimed, Her destiny to raise not some few nations But earth itself to her imperial height; Barbaric nerve with Rome's Traditions blent Alone could work that work; alone sustain it. This was the dream, not work, of Constantine: Augustus, Trajan's self, not even in dream Had grasped the thought. Rome ruled the East and West: She might have won the North not less and held it: Stilicho added thus: ‘Romans, that work Is not the sword's alone. In Gaul, Iberia, 'Twas work ill done. Conquering, Rome civilized them, But conquered first; and bondage means corruption; The Germans she must civilize first; then rule; Help them to fell their forests, fence their fields, To bridge their floods, in every noble art Ungrudgingly initiate them, invite Their Chiefs to Rome; as princes there receive them; By intermarriage fuse their race with hers; Teach them her laws to venerate, share her greatness And draw them thus, unvanquished, incorrupt, To seek admission to that world-wide Empire Raised for Man's weal. There lived a man Elect— He loved the Race Barbaric—he was of it: He loved your Rome—since youth he fought its battles; The aim persistent of that man was this Twofold to magnify your Roman Empire, And make its rule perpetual. Fools! fools! fools! The man ye hated was your last of friends: The warrior whom ye dreaded was, in head A politic Sage, in heart a man of peace. Ye know the rest. The vilest of your vile ones, Olympius, won your Emperor, made him dream The Father of his Wife, his second father, The saviour of his Empire—of his life— Some vulgar huckster was, or politic knave Trafficking in Empires as a merchant's wares, The Goths, for Gaul designed were at Bologna, Among them Stilicho. The Roman host, Their brave compeers on many a well-fought field, Camped at Pavia. There the Emperor joined them: Three days irresolute he sat; the fourth, Addressed them thus: ‘Legions of Rome, ye march To Gaul, the host barbaric at your side; No wish was this of mine.’ Drugged by Olympius, Those legions rose in mutiny: they slew The friends of Stilicho round Honorius ranged, The chief ones of the army and the State; The streets ran red with blood: the fires rushed up: Honorius hid disguised in slave's attire: Olympius sought him out: he bore a parchment: ‘The head of Stilicho:’—Honorius snatched it: In mingled rage and fear your Murderer signed. Bologna heard: then rose the cry of ‘Vengeance:’ Stilicho spake: ‘The Emperor is deceived: I served his Father: never hand of mine Shall war against his standard; never dash Goth against Roman.’ Late that night the Goths Assailed him in his tent: they slew his guards: He rose not from his desk; those Goths departed. Next morning Stilicho rode forth alone, Rode to Ravenna 'twixt the pines and sea. He slept that night in the Basilica, Sanctuary inviolate. At earliest dawn A royal herald at its portals stood With soldiers girt. He held a Rescript high Signed by your Emperor. Stilicho went forth: In vain the old Bishop cried, ‘Keep sanctuary!’ The gates fell back: the heralds read that scroll, ‘To Stilicho, a rebel 'gainst the State, Immediate death.’ Some few, that hour arrived, Advanced to shield him. Haughtily he stood: He waved us back: he willed to live no longer: He faced the soldiers. In a moment more He sank upon that fane's ensanguined step: His strong white head propped on this breast he died. His boy escaped to Rome; your Emperor slew him: His daughter, to that Emperor wedded late, That Emperor drave forth. His wife, Serena, The stateliest offshoot of the imperial stem, Saved by the savagery of Roman mercy, Exiled in solitude laments her lord; These things to you are nothing. Be it so. He died: Rome lives: how long ye Roman nobles? This matter touches you. Alaric draws nigh: Alaric and Stilicho were veracious men: Stilicho kept his word: Alaric will keep it. Alaric stood pledged to march with Rome to Gaul But found no Romans at the trysting-place. Alaric has changed his name: the title sole He claims to-day is this, ‘The Scourge of God.’ No death-cry from the lips of Stilicho Made way to Alaric's ear. Not less thereon A cry there rings, a cry of babes barbaric And bleeding mothers on whose breasts they died: These were your hostages: your legions slew them Mad with their triumph o'er that great one dead. That day full thirty thousand of the race Barbaric, to the Roman service vowed Their standards broke and marched to Alaric's camp: I march to meet him by to-morrow's dawn: I think that none of you will bar my way. Sleep well to-night: In three days Alaric greets you: Near him who harbours sleeps not well, men say. THE LEGEND OF SAINT GENEVIEVE. (DIED A.D. 512.) ARGUMENT. Saint Germanus, of Auxerre, reaches Nanterre, near Paris. Among the Christian people there he notes a child of seven years old, by name Genevieve, and knows by divine inspiration that she is a Saint. He enjoins upon her a great faithfulness to her Lord, and lifting from the ground a small iron relic, with the cross graven thereon, commands her to wear it round her neck till death, and to wear no ornament besides. Lastly, he announces that God will, through that child, draw many from their sins, and that she will one day be honoured as the Patron Saint of Paris; which predictions were fulfilled. Germanus, Saint and Bishop, who erewhile So glorious made his sacred see, Auxerre, Journeyed to Britain, then ‘The Northern Isle’ Styled by the Gauls. Heretic sin raged there: The Church of God had sent him for that cause To vindicate Christ's Faith, His Church's laws. One eve he reached, as slowly sank the sun, A tree-girt hamlet loud with children's sport His resting-place, for wont was he to shun Those cities huge where wealth and pride consort. Lutetian Paris stood not far: but he Loved men of lofty heart and low degree. Red on the church-roof hung the sunset fire; Thus spake he: ‘I in yonder church must pray To Him, its Guardian, 'mid the angelic choir— Great joy that Spirit should thus keep watch o'er clay!— First for that hamlet's children; next that I Though weak, may prosper in my mission high.’ That place was Pagan half and Christian half; Its Christian half swarmed forth to meet their guest Matron and elder leaning on his staff Young men and maids in crimson kirtle drest; In front a priest with brows to earth inclined Moved with slow footsteps: children raced behind. The Sire of men with lifted hand and heart Sent forth his blessing o'er that gladsome throng, Then moved among them zealous to impart The lore they loved. That time, Christ's poor among, A bishop still was greeted with such zest As when the callow fledgelings of a nest What time they hear the mother-bird returning Make gladsome stir and open beaks uplift For needful food, her foray's harvest, yearning; Then grateful feed, unquestioning of the gift:— Sudden that bishop's piercing eye was stayed Upon a child hard by, a seven-years maid. A heaven-like beauty triumphed in her face, A beauty such as vulgar souls pass by: Visibly on her beamed supernal grace: The whole sweet-moulded form, like lip and eye, Shone out in gracious meanings, made appeal To men who think aright because they feel. Germanus watched her long; then downward sped From heaven upon his spirit, there fell a beam; O'er his worn face that inner splendour spread; And thus he spake: ‘O friends we walk in dream: Far glories fancy-born, for these we sigh, For that cause miss God's marvels ever nigh. ‘See ye that child with eyes fast fixed on heaven? Elect was she ere sun or moon had birth! I tell you that, besides that angel given— Seraph perchance—her Guardian here on earth, Thousands this hour are following from above That creature's steps this hour with gaze all love. ‘I tell you that while wolf and wild boar trample God's Church, His Eden through all lands diffused, Within that infant breast God holds a temple That ne'er by man or fiend shall be abused; That sinners many she shall save, and bless This land, its mother-city's Patroness.’ Germanus ceased: then to that child he drew And straight she turned, as one who wakes from trance, Her dusk eyes from that heaven of deepening blue And fastened them on his. No transient glance Was hers, but fearless gaze and frank the while All round her quick red lips there ran a smile. He spake: ‘My child, if God should spare your life, In what sort would you live it when full grown? In convent or in house; a Christian wife With babes, or spoused to Christ, and His alone?’ She mused; then answered softly; ‘I would bide With Christ alone, His handmaid, child, and bride: ‘For where the convent rises from yon grove Spouses of Christ there dwell; and glad are they; From morn to eve their life is peace and love; And still they tend His poor, and still they pray: Me too, though stammerer yet, they teach to sing His praises. Hark! Their vesper bell they ring! ‘Beseech thee, Man of God, to lead me there! Beseech thee, bid those sisters in their choir To place me grown to maid-hood.’ Unaware She stretched to him both hands. That child's desire To that grey patriarch seemed as God's command: T'ward that still convent paced they hand in hand. Behind them thronged that concourse wondering much: Not few among them censured sore that child Demanding, ‘dares she then that hand to touch?’ Not so the Nuns: they saw from far, and smiled; Then near the altar raised a rustic throne And waited in the porch with myrtles strewn. Germanus entered: on that throne he sate: Unawed beside him stood that little maid; And ever, as the legends old relate, His wrinkled hand upon her head was stayed; His eyes were downward bent: upraised were hers As though the roof she saw not, but the stars. Some say that, heavenward while that anthem soared Which Mary made, knowledge of things to be Fell on him in the visions of the Lord, Those visions spirit-eyes alone can see; Such as the Hebrew Prophets saw of old, And Paul and Peter in God's later fold. He saw her climb, her lantern in her hand, Nightly, Montmartre, piercing the midnight gloom; He saw the Church that rose at her command Thereon, and hallowed more Saint Denis' tomb. Bright was that lantern: brighter far that light Which later from her grave made glad each night! He saw her, one slight finger raised, discourse With steel-clad Clovis on the Christian Faith, And t'ward it draw the warrior with sweet force: Lastly he saw her laid in happy death Near him and his Clotilde. For centuries fame Gave to that church wherein they slept her name. The anthem ended, with them died the day: Staff-propp'd, Germanus neared a threshold low: He beckoned to her parents: wondering, they Obeyed, and thus he spake in accents slow: ‘Severus and Gerontia, blest are ye Since great among God's Saints your child shall be. ‘Full oft, I deem, her slender hand and arm Ye raised, and with them traced the Sacred Sign To shield her infant brow and breast from harm Ere she that ritual's meaning could divine: It helped her well: better than I she knows, Few better, what that Cross on man bestows. ‘Liegeful I know hath been your wedded life, And that ye reverenced God's high sacrament Marriage, that rite which husband joins to wife With mystic meaning and benign intent: Reverence His Saint that 'neath your roof doth tarry As He, that Patriarch Husband, reverenced Mary. ‘She seeks that “better part” fitted for few: Nurse ye that hope; shield her from all things base; Rule her, and keep her holy, humble, true, For great the prize she claims, and hard the race: Farewell! Return at morn when heaven grows grey; With her return. Far hence I take my way.’ Next morn, an hour ere light, her parents led Their child to where that Sire of men had slept, Who, kneeling now, his matin office said: Throngs gathered near: round eastern clouds there crept A fiery fringe; next kindled hill and wood; Then, lo! before their eyes Germanus stood. The Blessing given, he turned him to that child— ‘Child, hast thou memory of thy wish last eve?’ The maid once more that smile bewildering smiled, Then spake; ‘I wished that I might never leave That house where Christ's sweet spouses dwell in bliss, But still, like them, be His, and only His.’ Then fixed the Patriarch on that child an eye Tender and strong yet edged with boding quest: He spake: ‘The woman's snare is vanity; When older, bar from it thine eyes, thy breast: Shun them who praise thee; bid them keep that praise For God: wise men it scares; the unwise betrays.’ That moment through disparted mists a beam Shot from the circlet of the ascending sun, Flashed on the pebbly path a spark-like gleam: The old man stooped, and from the shingles won A pilgrim's roughest relic. Thereupon Burnished like brass the Sign Redeeming shone. Silent he lodged it in that small white hand; Then closed her fingers. Next he spake with breath Low-toned; ‘In future years no gems demand Save this: this wear till death, and after death.’ She knelt: he laid his hands upon her head In blessing; kissed it last; then northward sped. She kept his gift. That wish, fair as a flower, To live for Christ might as a flower have died— A flower by March winds blighted. From that hour Solid it grew like stream-growth petrified Or like that relic which,—amid her dust— Guards still perchance its memorable trust. A people hath, like children, instincts sage: Significance in trifles it discerns; Keeps faith with vanished things from age to age; Drains heaven's nepenthé from earth's frailest urns: In faithful hearts, though rude the race, that hour God dropp'd a seed: the plant held healing power. That people knew what lived in Genevieve Like Saint Germanus when he saw her first; Knew it more late; they most the wise and brave They best who felt for heaven the heavenliest thirst, Whose heart was deepest and whose hope most high: Nearest they felt to God that creature nigh. They marked that things they dimly saw were clear To her as trees to them, or hills or skies; They knew that sensuous things to worldlings dear For her existed not, her ears, her eyes: Inmate of alien worlds she seemed; and yet Who heard her once could ne'er that voice forget. One half of Europe then the darkness covered; Night held its own; yet morning was at hand; Dubious betwixt the two her country hovered Like bird that half belongs to sea, half land. To France, sin's cripple, others preached the Word; Her life the Angel was Bethesda's well that stirred. The way of words is the way round-about: Good-will believes; and words lack power to give it: Die for thy Faith! then dies the good man's doubt: If Faith is tried no more by death, then live it! A great, true Faith expressed in life as true Lifts heart to heaven as sunbeams lift the dew. Her valour 'twas that taught in later times, The Maid of Orleans taught, to love her well; For centuries household bards in honest rhymes To breathless throngs were wont her deeds to tell Ere yet the Troubadour had tuned his song To hymn base loves and crown triumphant wrong. One sang how Childeric his Franks had led From that huge forest of the northern sea Where Varus lay with all his legions dead: How Childeric's host frenzied by victory Girt Paris like a wall:—no food remained; On the dead mother's breast the infant plained. Louder he sang how dear Saint Genevieve Launched her light bark and faced that downward flood, She and her four; beat back the insurgent wave; Baffled the shafts from bank and rain-drenched wood: She steered; they rowed while night was in the sky: Back sailed the Saint at dawn, that bark with loaves heaped high! As oft he sang to them in hut or hall A sister legend of their favourite Saint: The Frank was throned in Paris: fled the Gaul, Save one small band by foul and fell constraint Long weeks in dungeon vaults alive entombed, Their country's bravest sons: for that cause doomed. Childeric had seen the Saint; had heard that none Had power her strength and sweetness to resist: Wary the man: he vowed that face to shun: The power of female beauty well he wist: The power of Virtue he had yet to learn: That king had instincts high, though proud and stern. Paris, that time a fortress pile, most part Secure within its high-tower'd island lay: A wooden bridge the river stretched athwart Fenced by that grim gate of the Chatêley: To them who held that gate Childeric sent word ‘Obey, or die! Entrance to none accord!’ Propt by that gate at noon the warders slept: Sudden in trance they saw Saint Genevieve: Nearer she moved: strange music o'er them swept As when through portals of a huge sea-cave Makes way the organ anthem of the sea; That strain that fortress reach'd: its gate gave entrance free. That hour, that moment by King Childeric's throne Saint Genevieve stood up! If words she spake These words to angels, not to men, are known: The king sat mute. As one that half awake Sits blinded by the matin beam he stared:— This only know we; that the doomed were spared. Such acts survive: as age to age succeeds Man's sequent generations, mountain-wise, Reverberate echoes of heroic deeds: Each echo dies yet lives, and lives yet dies: And still, as on from cliff to cliff they float The strain remotest yields the tenderest note. These be the lesser things of Christian story By some o'er-prized. To o'er-prize them or impugn Alike is littleness. Faith's ampler glory Sits higher throned. There waxing as the moon, Strong as the sun, it lights the Christian sky: More great than miracle is Sanctity. Thence came that love which, 'mid those ages wild, France in her virgin breast, though rough yet true, That vernal morn conceived for that fair child On whom his long, last gaze Germanus threw Checking, as northward forth he rode, his rein, And looking back. That twain ne'er met again. Thence came that reverence which in France increased As Christian Faith deepened therein its sway; Which gladdened Lenten fast and Paschal feast; Inspired her Trouvére's tale, her harper's lay; Brightened young eyes; on wounded hearts dropt balm O'er Hosts crusading waved their Oriflamme. In later wars, when riot filled the tent One name sufficed to lull it—Genevieve: In peace to maids on girlish sports intent One thought of her a heavenlier gladness gave. They looked like those she led at dawn of day Before the Baptistery's shrine to pray. Ofttimes a Saint dear to his natal place Elsewhere is ill-remembered or unknown: But she, wherever spread her country's race, Was loved: the Loire revered her as the Rhone: Three names for aye blazed on that country's shield— Saint Genevieve, Saint Denis, Saint Clotilde. AMALASUNTA. (DIED A.D. 535.) ARGUMENT. Amalasunta was the daughter of Theodoric the Great, the Gothic King of Italy, and a woman of extraordinary beauty, learning and accomplishments. On her father's death she became Regent, the King, her son, being a child. Through the violence of the Gothic Chiefs, whose oppressions she had held in check, she was sent a prisoner to an island in the lake of Bolsena, to perish among its pestilential marshes. In that island she was murdered. In this Legend she revolves the career of her father—the spell which the greatness of Rome, though past, had exercised over his mind in youth; his desire that her Empire should be enlarged and perpetuated by including within itself the Barbaric races; his equal treatment of Goth and Italian, the restoration of Italian prosperity and letters. Lastly, she remembers in anguish the crimes which stained the close as well as the initiation of his reign; the judicial murder of Boethius and Symmachus whose children she had restored, and the persecution of the Catholic Faith, which, till then, though an Arian, Theodoric had treated with respect; his remorse, and unhappy death. It is a tender and a gracious morning, A morning peacefuller than the calmest eve— Some meaning there must lurk in such a calm. Tells it of death, or something after death? The grey lake hath its gleam and naught beside: If it had wrong last night, to-day it plains not; No ripple prints its sands; no sailing cloud Is imaged in its bosom; not a bird Flutes 'mid the reeds or streaks the level mere. The autumn-reddened copses lose their red In vapoury distance. Nature's latest sigh Is breathed—like mine—and now for both is stillness. Lasts it for aye, that stillness? Lo! I drop A pebble o'er the water. Hark, a sound! The pebble sinks: some petty bubbles rise: Twinkle; then break. When this, our Gothic realm Built by my Sire, Theodoric, meets its term Like yonder pebble it will sink, send up That bubble from the waters of oblivion Which men call Fame, and in a moment more Be gathered to the dark. How strangely now That buried past returns to me! My Sire! With what a puissant hand and mastering brain Didst thou build up that kingdom! With what high joy I, then a child, my hand upon thy knee, Mine eyes upon thy face, listened the tale! Thy youth in Constantine's more beauteous Rome Washed by Propontic waves; thy sedulous study Of that once-splendid polity then grey-grown; Thine early vow—how like to Stilicho's— To prop that ruined realm, our foe of old— Sustain her, not destroy. I hear thee speak: ‘The Empire's power survived the Empire's self: She was a wreck yet ruled. My youth gone by, I roamed amid her wrecks of greatness dead Kingly, Republican, Imperial greatness; In them the history of the world was writ: All men saw that; Alone I marked a cradle 'mid the tombs, The cradle of whatever greatness God Reserves for future earth. A sin it seemed To snatch the sceptre from that wrinkled hand Now feebler than a babe's.’ He ended thus; ‘Only when long experience painfully proved That Rome, old Rome, lay choked in her own ashes, I said, “A Gothic kingdom I will rear Cast in the Roman mould.”’ I heard him speak it With that deep voice and lion-like! My tears Fell heavy on his hand. His rival dead, He too of race barbaric—Odoacer— Ah me! How dead? whose hand? I feared to ask! I would, I would, I ne'er had heard that name! My Father filled a throne. He stole it not; Nor styled himself the Emperor of the West: His race he deemed the noblest of the North: He strove to blend it with the Roman, strove In vain, alas, to breathe its manly vigour Through that dead Empire. Equal laws to both He gave, the Italian Lands portioned betwixt them. Dead learning lived again; new letters flourished; In them he trained me. ‘I,’ thus spake he once, ‘Can rule a host, evoke from nought a kingdom, Yet scarce can write my name. But thou, my child, Purer than northern Odin's coldest daughters Shalt pass in learning Egypt's amorous queen, (Mark Antony's Fate) in beauty Grecian Helen.’ Then I; ‘for name I choose Antigoné, Who led her blind old exiled Sire through Greece, His living staff.’ My Father smiled. Alone On face so rough can rest a smile so sweet! That smile went slowly by: again he mused: ‘Thank Heaven, the father dies before the child! Girl! I have chosen even now thy future husband, The noblest of our royal race, the Amali: See that your child and his be fit for rule— If hot his blood, as mine, he'll need much training— To him, that child, the crown of Earth shall pass, My work on Earth completed!’ O my Sire, Much, much of that high vision was fulfilled! To dwell upon that thought is still my peace. This Italy was but thine Empire's core, Rhætia, Dalmatia, Norieum, Pannonia, The West was thine. Iberia, southern Gaul, Earth from Danubius to the Atlantic pillars! The Italians held the civil offices, The Goths the warlike. Peace returned—then gold; In desolate cities glorious structures rose; Fair villas smiled above the Larian lake; The waves Lucanian: classic song revived: Philosophy looked up once more to heaven: Hope ruled again the world. These things I learned Less from my Father than from Cassiodorus:— How writes he now? ‘The realm I served is doomed, Thy Father's thirty years and three of greatness Make dismal end. Thou knowest Calabria bore me: There will I build to God a monastery; There 'mid the ocean thunders find my rest; There on Boethius muse. Pray that my life, Too blest, too peaceful for heroic virtue, May there make holy end.’ But thou, my Sire, What end was thine? 'Twas not a happy one 'Twas penitent at least;—and yet not peaceful? Ah, had that end but earlier come! With most Age shows in weakening brain. In thee the omen Was wrath more fiery; lessened self-control. Diversities of Faith began the woe, Diversities whereof thou said'st so oft, ‘Battles are these of fools!’ That Eastern Empire Warred on our Arian Faith. Then rang thy shout, ‘I on its Western Faith will war in turn! I never loved that Apostolic Throne.’ Thy people which had loved thee learned to hate: Thenceforth suspicions gnawed thee; and thy sword Smote that great twain, Boethius, Symmachus. Informal death may yet be righteous death, But these high victims died without a trial: They loved thee though they scorned to fawn on power. Then came that dread remorse: that sudden madness. I see thee spurn that board; confront that Spectre That bent on thee Boethius's placid eye; Again I hear thee make distraught demand, ‘Who sent thee hither? Was it Odoacer?’— Again I see thee hurl from thee thy crown, Hear thy last word; ‘The Frank shall have the Empire.’ My Father, what to thee are Empires now? I built his Tomb: that was my first of cares, My care as daughter and as Regent both: The gold it cost had fee'd a body-guard And lopped betimes treason's unnumbered hands. 'Twas better spent. That Tomb o'erlooks Ravenna, Its harbours, and the pine-woods far away:— Above it hangs that dome, one granite block: Inurned o'er all repose my Father's bones:— So long as Adrian billows lash Ravenna Pilgrims shall stand before that Tomb and cry, ‘There lies Theodoric, King of Goths: he ruled Half earth; yet scorned to bear the Imperial name.’ Are there not those who say that Love is gladness? I never found it such. Love for my Sire To me, a motherless child, meant ceaseless fears Of swords barbaric or Byzantine poisons; How oft in the wan dawn behind his door I listened for his breath! That year of marriage— Thank God, my Husband lived to see his son! Had he survived, that son had lived this hour! How beautiful he was! How like a fawn He bounded through the woods! And yet—and yet— How suddenly that fawn would change to pard! Wayward to most, to me he still was loving, Save once when some rough Chief that passed us growled, ‘Warrior he'll never prove.’ A casual saying! And yet it cost a life! They change the Guard! I never hear that tramp of armed heels But that black hour returns! Once more as then The palace courts grow dark with frowning brows; Around me stand the steel-clad mutinous Chiefs, Each with drawn sword. Again I hear them cry, ‘We brook no more this female government: Thy son shall rule; not thou!’ They hated me:— A woman reigns not in a Gothic realm: I stood too near thy throne. They hated me Because I stayed their ravage on the poor. That day the boy had struck his grey-haired tutor; To the feasting chiefs herushed: denounced his wrongs: The chiefs! 'Twas they who turned him 'gainst his Mother! Thus to their insolent speech I made reply; ‘It is the strong rule, not the weakling rule, Sirs, which ye hate. Theodoric, late your King, Governs his grandson through his daughter's hand.’ They passed me with the boy. That hour mine eye Fell on three daggers which beside me lay Bought for my ladies from a Merchant Mede: I held them up and spake: ‘Sirs, I impeach you This day of treason 'gainst my son and me! Your sins will taint my son: his own will slay him: When that day comes, albeit I stand this hour A queen deposed, those daggers there shall find you, Lawfully sentenced by these lips this day, Sentenced, though now the execution halts.’ They led him forth: he passed me without word: They gave him foul ensample and he fell: The wine-cup was his teacher, not his Mother. His sixteenth birthday came: a step approached: It was not his: a man drew near and spake: ‘The king's physicians say all hope is o'er! Even now he dies.’ I rose from where I sat: Rushed to his chamber. It was locked—their wont! I took those daggers three. Three faithful men I sent to where upon the kingdom's bound Those three the foremost in that murder ruled: On the third day they cumbered earth no longer. Another day is past! Hail, evening breeze! How strange a weight of sighs must load thy wings Travelling man's world! They stifle not thy freshness! Cool, cool this burning heart! They sent me here Fearing my people would avenge my wrong, They kept me here not stabbing me to kill, Choked by yon mist. Its work is sure yet slow: Unmannerly it seems to task their patience. Justinian spake me fair yet will not aid me, Much less that Emperor's Empress. Cassiodorus Writes thus: ‘The men of death are on thy track.’ That sentence I forgot. I like it well: Not these slow mists;—their daggers will restore me Those whom I ne'er forget. A Christian true Would say, ‘Will earlier give me to my God.’ I fear our Gothic Faith hath lacked a something; Have thought at times those Catholics with their creed Transcendant more than ours, their mystic rites That seem to lift our earth so nigh to heaven, Their friendly ways with Mary and God's Saints, Were born beneath a happier star than we, And on a soul of sweeter, silkier grain Take the celestial impress. Arians we: They that baptized our nation stamped it Arian: That suits rough hearts. The ignorant cannot choose 'Twixt creeds: the faithful scarce can quit old friends— My father failed. The imperial reign o'er earth It may be is reserved for one who holds His crown from Christ; believes He reigns in heaven. I fear I never had a full devotion: Yet this I sought; to live as God commands, Bear bravely what He sends: and this I hope, Death past, to meet my Sire—my Son—my Husband, Meet them unstained. If my own blood should stain me I pardon—'tis God's Law—my murderers. —‘The Frank shall have the Empire, not the Goth:’ In death he spake it; and his word is true. SAINT BONIFACE AT FULDA. (DIED A.D. 755.) ARGUMENT. Saint Boniface, first called Winfrid, belonged to Wessex. When a child, he was taken by his father to see Saint Cuthbert, and ever afterwards desired to evangelize the heathen, and to seal his testimony by his blood. Both wishes were granted. For forty years he preached Christ in Germany, of which country he is revered as the Apostle. That work accomplished, he was slain by bandits with all his fellow-labourers near the stream Borduc in Friesland. While his companions take their noontide rest, the Saint meditates the events of his long life—his first failure in Friesland—his sojourn in Rome, where Pope Gregory changed his name to Boniface, and made him Archbishop of Mentz—his daily labours and sufferings in the great German forest, and the benignant dreams by which those sufferings were nightly assuaged. He praises the German races, and adjures them to remain for ever faithful to Christ. What is it makes the Universe of God So wondrous seem this day? 'Tis always fair, Balm-breathing, glorious, like a monarch throned Or priest who kneels gold-vested by God's altar Offering to God man's praise. 'Tis always great: Though we discern its greatness but in glimpses; This day that greatness grows to palpable; This day anticipates those heavens and earth That shall be when immortalizing Death Removes for us their veil. Again I feel As when, a seven-years child, near Carleol Carleol, now Carlisle. I stood 'mid those who kept their Pentecost And gazed on great St. Cuthbert's reverend Face, And saw therein all heaven. From earliest youth The passion of my life was one and sole To die for Christ. What argues love, like death? Next to that great desire my hope was this, To free our brethren of the German Forest From vassalage blind to Odin and to Thor. This was my childhood's dream on Wessex' coast: This was my boyhood's vow at Escancester: That vanished life how strangely since the morn It haunts me! If this day should prove my last Why not? My happiest it may also prove. My brethren take their noontide sleep: no doubt All heavenly are their dreams. To me more healing Will be my memories of the years gone by. 'Twas well no doubt my earliest effort failed: It humbled me. To Friesland I had gone; Later I passed to Rome: a Roman noble Showed me its pagan glories. What were they? The sum of all that virtue counts for naught; That Faith esteems as loss. A nightmare 'twas, A bad man's wickedest dream—such dream as stands Near him, belike, death past, his destined penance In bodiless worlds where sin is known as sin. From trophies of proud wrong to them I fled The houses of Cecilia and Prassedé Churches full fair this day. Awe-struck I bent, O'er that black vault, the dread Mamertine prison, Where sat of old Saint Peter and Saint Paul In silence side by side. Three months I dwelt In that metropolis of the Christian world. Three times that later Gregory then the Pope Probed me with searching question of the Faith; Next he ordained me Bishop; smiling, last, He changed my name to Boniface from Winfred, And bade me to the heathen. I made vow To guard Christ's Faith from wrong, His Church from schism; Can he love Christ who little loves His Church? The scroll whereon that vow was writ I laid Upon Saint Peter's tomb. Nigh forty years I roamed from realm to realm that German land, Pannonia, and Thuringia, Dacia, Rhetia, Bavaria, and Burgundia. Oft, how oft I longed for that high grace, the ‘gift of tongues,’ Then when the natives crowding round me came, Each with his woes—and sins—and none to help him! I looked at them and wept; yet thus I mused Forward! great Love suffices, Love can teach: And thus I spake: ‘Demand thou light from God:’ Those words I knew in all their languages; And still I pointed to the heavens; and still Taking the hand of each, three times I drew From brow to breast the Venerable Sign: That gave them help. They knew my heart: they said ‘This man brings tidings good and cannot speak them!’ God spake them in their hearts. In later days I learned their tongues. To frivolous questioners I answered thus: ‘No theologian I! I bear a message; I divulge the Tidings:’ The unanswered question was forgotten soon; The Tidings welcomed. Marvellous was their Faith: How oft I cried, ‘the single eye is theirs: Venturous are they to seek for Truth, then use it: That fineness which prevaricates with God Is none of theirs. Like storms, passions may rend them; Then comes that counter-passion of Remorse And burns away the stain.’ Transitions swift O'er-swept them. Once when, axe in hand, we hewed An oak to Odin vowed, they closed around us: Circles they made: the inner raised their clubs, The outer, lances level with their shoulders; They stood; they glared:—we smote with stroke o'er stroke The stem; the strong root shrieked; the crash succeeded: We looked for death: their rage had changed to awe: Kneeling they cried: ‘Great Odin then is dead!’ Next day they sawed from that dismembered tree The planks that walled our church. There stand those walls High on that hill where storms have thinned the woods. Saint Paul is instant in his affirmation That Faith and Hope are children both of Love. O noble Twins, I never felt your greatness Until that happy day! There 'mid yon woods I founded Fulda, and its Monastery! That Church will prove a Mother Church! Yet there I met my first repulse. When times were worst, All were not mild and loyal like the best: Of them who joined our following some betrayed us: That was our worst of trials; next to that Hunger and frost-wind fanged with death, and cry Day-long of wolves echoed from woods and rocks, And death of good men from our English shores That yearly joined my toils. When times were worst This thought recurred; the woes we face, what are they Compared with that wild dread which shook the world Three hundred years gone by? Then man to man Whispered death-pale, ‘The Barbarous hordes advance;’ And in the bridegroom's hand the hand of bride Shivered ice-cold. ‘Where plants my horse his foot Grass grows no more;’ thus cried King Attila: Huge realms became as lands the locust-cloud But late o'erswept: where temple and street had stood, High as their horses' chests the conquerors rode Through ashes strewn. Civility was dead. That day the sage and peasant side by side Watched from the city-wall the advancing woe As when the fountain of the mighty deep Had open burst, and tremblers on hill crests Eyed the great Deluge with its watery wall On moving t'ward them. Faith alone remained, That Faith a weeping Faith. The greatest man And best that time on earth was Saint Augustine. He saw that Terror reach the Afric coast: He heard the echoes of the falling cities: At last the Vandal reached his sacred See, He said, ‘The shepherd with his flock should die:’ Daily, though broken, to his church he crept: Daily he taught the poor. When sickness smote him He spread his pallet midmost in his cell And gave command to trace upon its walls In letters large the Penitential Psalms Which evermore he read till ceaseless tears Dimmed the strong eyes nigh fourscore years had left Like eagles' eyes. At last he gave command ‘Henceforward leave me, friends, with God alone:’ In holy sorrow thus Augustine died. Ah me! man's sorrows are his chief illusions! One half of those Tribes Barbaric now are Christ's, With them our English Kingdoms Seven. Worst days At night were gladdened oft by dreams divine. The first was sent that day I reached this land: In dream I roamed our Wessex shores; the sun Reddened, late risen, the broad trunks of the oaks, Or fired their mossy roots. The fair green lawns Swelled up 'mid bosky knolls of beech o'er-dewed And orchards whence sea-scented breezes rapt White bloom o'er azure waves. Onward I passed To where a river, widening, joined the sea. There on a promontory stood a house; The ripple lapp'd its basement; gladsomer sounds Allured my footsteps; 'twas our garden old! Brightening the borders of our English sea, My brothers and my sisters trod its grass! No gesture, face, or voice 'scaped my remembrance: Like mist the happy years had passed. There stood That maiden child, with hair half brown half gold; A spirit of love she stood with yearning eyes All light; close by, that vestal pale, her sister, Statelier though younger, and with look severe. I leaned upon the gate; a sweet voice said, ‘Yon aged man is wayworn: bid him rest:’ They drew a bench beside me; kissed my hand Honouring white hairs, and then resumed their game. There midmost sat my Father and my Mother: Delight of health and strength within them glowed; Around them all was fortunate; joyous all; Misgiving lived not. Half my present years; Seemed theirs, or less. Sixty o'er me had passed: Thirty seemed theirs. The strangest of emotions Is his, methinks, who from the heights of age Looks back upon his parents in their youth, Sees them once more in some remembered scene Their day of youth—the old man's day of childhood. 'Tis still with childhood's Reverence he regards them; But Reverence which, commingled with a love Foreboding, half parental, prompts that prayer, ‘Help them, great God! Their inexperience shield!’ The heavenliest of those dreams was mine last night. The moon had set. Alone I paced a cliff: That Wessex height it seemed whereon, a boy, Nightly I walked—its name the cliff of Torre— Not distant from a blue south-facing bay. I saw the Hyads and the Pleiads rise And the dim seas star-gemmed. A sudden glory Drank up those lesser lights. Aloft I gazed: And lo! from western heavens a marvel shone; Downward and onward both, lapsing it moved, With exquisitest cadence nearing earth: At last it stood, a mystic fabric fair, Self-radiant and serene. High-towered it stood Like minster's portal triple-arched. Within I saw a wondrous company, and knew Each one by name. These were the Saxon Saints, My country's, and—one family with them— (For kindreds in the skies are spirit-linked) More closely than by bonds of flesh and blood, Erin's and Rome's that drew our race to Christ: High Kings of Peace they stood, yet wearing, each, God's armour, and the Truth's, the Spirit's sword Breast-plate of Faith, and helmet of Salvation. There stood our great Augustine; by his side King Ethelbert, Queen Bertha, hand in hand; Saint Laurence glorying in God's rights restored; King Sebert gazing t'ward Saint Peter's Church New-risen on Thamis' bank; Northumbrian Oswald Beckoning Columba's sons to bless his realm; Those three great Bishops, Aidan, Finan, Colman, Iona's lights shining from Lindisfarne; Bernician Oswy by his consort's tears To penance won and peace. Apart I saw Heida, the prophetess of dark woods, who found In Odin's faith our Christ. With beaming brow Stood Hilda as she stood on Whitby's rock Listening from Cædmon's lips the immortal song; Cædmon stood near her—silent; for his ear Had heard the song of angels. Frideswida Mused on her destined Oxford. Cuthbert smiled As when beside that flood near Carleol I fixed on him mine eyes, and heard him say, ‘Of men the greatest is that man who draws To God, God's creatures.’ Venerable Bede Sat central there in stillness of great love Brow-bent above his scroll. From these remote And taller far a monarch stood, with front Monastic but the sceptre-wielding hand: Foretold long since in Wessex Banquet Hall, When spake God's Prophet, ‘Alfred is his name.’ Then raised those Saints their hymn, and with that hymn, For what hath Heavenly birth returns to Heaven, Onward and up that glory slowly rose, And as it rose they stretched to me their hands: Therefore 'tis certain I shall die ere long, Perhaps to them be joined. Eternal Power That called'st me forth from nothing, I return To Thee, my Maker. Sinner though I be My life has not been void. The coral worm In the dark laborious, builds up continents: Shall we, Thy creatures of the hand and head, Leave naught for God or man? Through help of Thine I laboured to be worthy of that help; Yea, tremble ofttimes to have wrought some tasks Fitter for cleaner hand. Cædmon bewailed ‘In youth I shamed to sing amiss: in age To have sung, impostor-like, some strains too high For one so scant of grace.’—At best I made Beginning only: perfect, Thou, that work Lest, lacking roof the rain corrode the walls. My People want not zeal, but they are heady: Imaginations wild take hold of them As sensual lures on men of southern climes, Yea, with a subtler might; for thus 'tis writ, ‘Our wrestling is with Spirits in high places, The Princes of the Powers of the air That rule in Darkness.’ Teach my People, God, Humility! When those tempestuous fires That swell this day their hearts, to the brain ascending There kindle storm of thought—bid them that hour Revere his voice, the Gentiles' Teacher sage, The man for measureless wisdom scorned as mad, Who, raised at times to visions of the Lord, A mystic walking ever in the Spirit, Was instant thus: ‘Be sober, and keep watch: Be not o'er-wise, for knowledge puffeth up, Charity buildeth up.’ Brethren, arise! 'Tis time we were afoot! What sound was that In yonder wood? 'Twas like the clash of arms;— Men spake of bandits late. Brethren, awake! 'Tis Eve of Whit-Sunday: Eve of the Birth-day of God's Church on Earth: His Church Triumphant waits us in the skies. But we have humbler visitants this hour: Three thousand late baptized in Borduc's stream— Thanks to this balmy June nor girl nor boy Nor sire grey-haired shivered in the water— We them meet us in yon wood this day For the Confirmation Rite. Arise. They wait. THE CROWNING OF CHARLEMAGNE; AND THE CREATION OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. (A.D. 800.) AN ODE. I. That God of God the universe Who made, Who spake, and from the void rushed forth the stars, That God their orbits shaped, their movements swayed, Wrote on their brows in shining characters ‘God's flock are we: our freedom is to go That way His Finger points, in movements swift or slow:’ That God spake Law not less to Man: He said, ‘Revere your kings; work Justice: Order cherish: Live like Mine angels; not like beasts that perish;’— Helping God's Poor. Primeval man obeyed: Those earlier Patriarch kings were shepherds true: Bad kings came next: in torrent ever new: The blood-stream rolled o'er earth. Then rose that cry ‘One King should rule below: One God there reigns on high.’ II. Then Empires rose: their subject kings Like princely children lived in peace Cowering successive 'neath the wings Of Assur, Babylon, Persia, Greece. Alas, those four great Empires to the world Bequeathed not growth: the wheel round ran; The sighing vans around were whirled; They stored nor wheat nor bran: Much for man's pride they wrought: nothing for Man. The windy towers shadowed a barren strand: The sea-gales ground but the sea-sand— Rome rose at last; her Empire stretched o'er all. In claim a firmament, in time a pall. III. What changed that Empire's good to ill? Ignorance that nations shrine—like man—a Spirit; That sowing to the flesh their hope they kill, Renounce that spiritual crown true States inherit. Material good sufficed Rome's Empire old: No God believing, every God it served: Whate'er it touched its gold hand changed to gold: Full-gorged it starved: The pampered body throve from scalp to sole; But on the spirit God sent leanness and bitter dole. IV. A nobler Rome hath risen! For centuries bound she lay in chains of Fate, Far down in earth's dark prison: She roamed on coasts unknown, sunless and desolate. ‘Lo here,’ man cried, ‘Lo there!’ The Earth incredulous wept in ever new despair— Silence, astonished lands! She lives! The great, true Rome among you stands! Old Rome was but the statue's base: This day the Christian Rome assumes its destined place. V. What functions gird this Wonder new That stands a-gazing on the sun? This Empire's Head Elect to Whom must he be true? Kings have their realms each one: He should have none: A meteor course this Wonder may have run: He may have lived unknown, or known to few. His field of action is the earth's wide sphere: No personal ends hath he; no interests small and near: A spiritual sword this Man must wield To quell the kingly or the popular pride: His first great function is to shield From caitiff hand Christ's Bride; I saw in heaven a Sign; I saw a Sceptre and a man Divine: Beneath, I saw a Dragon that pursued A Woman o'er the earth, still raging for her blood. VI. That Emperor's next of functions is to guard Justice, God's Attribute Which stamps distinction prime 'twixt man and brute, In each man sees God's ward. God's Mercy to God's Church belongs; Through Love she lifts His people to His height; The Emperor wields His Justice; tramples wrongs; Renders man's life on earth the triumph of the Right. The Emperor metes God's justice among kings:— Justice and Mercy are the sister wings Whereon God's new Creation issues forth, New Heavens, new Earth— Things old have passed away; things new have come to birth. VII. Not one of woman born Divined the sequel this great Christmas morn When paced Rome's mitred Sire to where, That spot beside Where hung of old Saint Peter crucified That Frankish king knelt on that tombstone-stair! His hands the pontiff raised: Dropt, silent, down On that high kneeler's brow the Imperial Crown— The crown one gazed Round him like one by sudden lightning mazed: Took passively that crown; then turned again to prayer. VIII. The Frank was chosen not the Goth, Though puissant both; Though wider far the Gothic race had spread; More oft for Rome had bled; To politic wisdom had an earlier claim; Had boasted first the Christian name. Tell us, high-favoured, what was that which won The birthright for the younger son? The Frank long since had shown his right to rule: Our Charles it was who smote that Idol, Irminsûl; Yea, though that Idol centuries eight had cried ‘Here Roman Varus, with his Legions died’ The Goth was Arian: Christ, if less than God, Had only earlier raised the Arabian Prophet's Rod! —What mean those silver trumpets in mine ears. Blown from the summits of St. Peter's fane? They mean not mad ambitions, widows' tears; They mean the warbling of celestial spheres Echoed from Earth's low plain; The Jubilee Of every race and order and degree, The Kingdom of the Just, the God-man's endless reign. IX. Rise, then, thou chief of Empires and the last, The Church's Eldest Son! Rise, first of Empires, for the whole world's Past In thee lives on! Ride forth, God's Warrior, armed with God's Command To chase the great Brand-Wielder with Christ's brand To the Asian deserts back, and wastes of burning sand. In one brief century from the Impostor's death Past Mecca's gates the fiery flood had rolled In ruin o'er the Church's land of gold: Bethlehem and Nazareth The Sepulchre of Christ, were hers no more: The Alexandrian Empire, Egypt hoar The gem-crowned realms that held the south in fee Dazzling the Afric limits of the Midland Sea, Were lost: Iberia followed: trembled Gaul: And Arab Horse were seen from Rome's eternal wall!— Islam shall die! the Faith shall burst its chain! Who smote the turbaned host on Poitiers' plain? Charles Martel, grandsire of our Charlemagne! Not East and South alone:—to Christ give thou Those northern shores whereon ne'er grated Roman prow! Show thou how great a thing Empire may be While planet-stricken Emperors round thee nod, When founded not on sanctities downtrod, When not by greed and guilt Ingloriously up-built, But reared to be a fortress of the free, A temple for our God. Part II MEDIÆVAL RECORDS TO THE MEMORY OF KENELM HENRY DIGBY WHOSE ‘BROADSTONE OF HONOUR’ AND ‘MORES CATHOLICI’ NOBLY ASSERTED THE TRUE GREATNESS OF THE MIDDLE AGES, WHEN RECOGNIZED BY FEW, This Volume IS DEDICATED BY AUBREY DE VERE LEGENDS OF THE CID. INTRODUCTORY. The Cid was born A.D. 1026 and died A.D. 1099. His original name was Rodrigo di Bivar. In him, as the chief record of him has descended to us, Spain gave birth to the most entirely characteristic representative of mediæval chivalry. He embodied its happiest as well as its most heroic spirit. His military ardour was free alike from barbaric ruthlessness, and from the ambition of a Cæsar or an Alexander. He had not a touch either of that exaggerated love of praise which, at a later time, vulgarized the instinct of Honour, or of that selfishness and sentimentality which has infected modern times. For him all self-consciousness seems to have been lost in a light-hearted yet impassioned loyalty to just, generous, patriotic, and religious ends. Such were the ‘Men of Old’—‘They went about their gravest deeds Like noble boys at play.’— Lord Houghton. I. The Cid's Marriage. WithinValencia's streets were dole and woe; Among the thoughtful, silence long and then Sharp question and brief answer; sobs and tears Where women gathered; something strange concealed From children; rapid step of priest grey-grown As though his mission were to beds of death. The cause? Nine days before, the sea had swarmed With ships continuous like the locust cloud Full sail from far Morocco; six days later Strange tents had crowded all the coasts as thick As spots on corpse plague-stricken. The Cid lay dead, Valencia's bulwark, but her sire much more. Who else had made her Spain's;—Spain's Mother-City Frowning defiance on the Prophet's coasts Minarets enskied, gold domes, huge palaces With ivory fretwork washed by azure waves, Even to the fabulous East? Day passed: night came: Within Valencia's chiefest church the monks Knelt round their Great One. He had sat since death Throned near the Eastern altar. At the West The many-columned aisles nigh lost in gloom Changed to a fortress pile with massive walls Lost in the mother rock, since Faith and War That time were brethren vowed. Beneath its vault Good knights kept watch, that stronghold's guard at need: Glimmerings from distant altar lights, though faint, Made way to them, oft crossed by shadowy forms Gliding in silence o'er the pavements dim With bosom-beating hand: the music strain Reached them at times; less oft the voice of prayer. Compline long past, the eldest of those knights, By name Don Raymond, Lord of Barcelona, Not rising, thus addressed low-toned his mates: With great desire the nations will desire To know our Cid in ages yet to come, And yet will know him not. He was not one Who builds a history up, complete and whole, A century's blazon crying, ‘That was I!’ The day's work ever was the work he worked, And laughingly he wrought it. Spake another: Ay, 'twas no single act that made his greatness: Yet greatness flashed from all his acts—the least; A peasant cried one day, ‘God sent that man;’ A realm made answer, ‘God.’ Don Sambro next: I witnessed—'twas in youth—his earliest deed; Gladsome it was, and gladdening when remembered, Yet nowise alien 'mid these vaults of death: His sire, Don Diego, was an aged man; Between him and Count Gomez, Gormaz' lord, Debate arose. Gomez had flourished long A warrior prime: whene'er the Cortes met He spake its earliest word. Among the hills A thousand watched his hand, and wrought its hest. That day, inflamed by wine, he struck Diego: Diego, warrior once, then weak from age, Was all unmeet for combat in the lists: Daily he sat, grief-worn, beside his hearth And shrank from friend like one who fears to infect Sound man by hand diseased. He spake but once, ‘Till that black hour dishonour none defiled Layn Calvo's blood!’ His son, our Cid, Rodrigo, Then twelve years old, leaped up! ‘Mudarra's sword! That and your blessing!’ Strong through both he rode, Nor stayed until his horse foam-flecked stood up At Gormaz’ gate. Gomez refused his challenge: Rodrigo smote him: soon the lists were formed: Not long the strife: sole standing o'er the dead Thus 'mid that knightly concourse spake the boy, ‘Had he but struck my cheek, and not my sire's, Far liefer had I lopped mine own left hand Than yon sage head!’ Count Gomez’ orphaned daughter, Child of ten years, hearing that word, replied, ‘He also had a Father.’ August's sun Westering had tinged the castle hall with red: There sat Diego at the supper-board But eating not. A horse's foot was heard: In rushed, all glowing like that sun, the boy: He knelt; then rising, laughed. Aloud he cried, ‘Father, your fare hath scanty been of late As spider's when long frosts have frozen the flies: Haply this herb may sharpen appetite!’ His mantle fell: he lifted by the locks The unjust Aggressor's head. Diego rose: First with raised eyes he tendered thanks to Heaven; Then added: ‘Son, my sentence ever stood, The hand that battles best is hand to rule: Henceforth live thou sole master in this house;’ He pointed, and the seneschal kneeling laid The castle's keys before the young man's feet. Then clamour rose, ‘O'er yon portcullis fix That traitor's head, that all may gaze upon it And hate it as a true man knows to hate!’ Not thus Rodrigo willed He sent that head To Gormaz with a stately retinue— Ten knights, and priests entoning ‘Miserere.’ This solaced Gomez’ child. Then rose that saying, ‘He strikes from love, not hate.’ Don Martin next— Don Martin of Castile: Witness was I Not less of wonders by Rodrigo wrought. Eight years went by: his father died. The Moors Swarmed forth o'er many a region of Castile, Domingo, La Calzada, Vilforado, Capturing whole herds, white flocks, and brood-mares many: Rodrigo of Bivar to battle rushed; Smote them where Oca's mountains closed them round; Retook their spoil. Five Moorish kings, their best, He haled in triumph home to Bivar's gate And bade them kneel chain-bound before his mother. That homage tendered, thus he spake: ‘Depart!’ That holy Lady still had taught her son Reverence for sufferers, and the Poor of Christ, And courtesy 'mid wildest storms of war. On her he looked, later on them; continued: ‘I scorn to hold you captive! from this hour My vassals ye. I want nor slaves nor serfs.’ The Five made answer ‘Yea,’ and called him ‘Cid,’ Their term for ‘Lord’: he bore it from that hour. Don Garcia next: A fairer sight by far And fitter to beguile our sorrowful watch, I saw—his marriage. Our great King Ferrando, Who made one realm of Leon and Castile, Beside that new-built bridge Zimara called Was standing 'mid his nobles on a day What time that name, ‘The Cid,’ rang first o'er Spain: Then drew to him a maiden clothed in black, A sister at each side. She spake: ‘Sir King, I come your suitor, child of Gomez, once Your counsellor and your friend, but come not less The claimant of my right. Betwixt my sire And Diego, father of that Cid world-famed This hour for valour and for justice both, Unhappy feud arose: my father smote him: Aggrieved by that mischance the Cid, then young, Challenged my sire and in the tourney slew him, To me great grief albeit, on wars intent, My father seldom saw me. Since that day Tumult perpetual shakes our vassal realm: Who wills breaks down the bridge; who wills diverts The river from our mill-wheel to his own: Daily the insurgent commons toss their heads, Clamouring “No tax.” I fear for these, my sisters, Fear more the downfall of our House and Name, And, motherless, have none with whom to counsel. King! some strong hand and just should quell this wrong! What hand but his who caused it? 'Twas his right To smite his Father's smiter. 'Tis my right To choose for champion him who wrought the woe. Command him to espouse me! That implies Privilege and Duty both to ward our House, And these my sisters young.’ Level and clear She fixed upon the King her eyes like one Who knows her cause is just. Ferrando mused, Then answered, smiling, ‘Damsel, have your will! You are happier than you know! Rodrigo's Wife! Of him you wot as little as of marriage! Yon Cid will prove the greatest man in Spain.’ Then with a royal frankness added thus: ‘Moreover, maid, your lands are broad: another Conjoining them with his might plot and scheme: The Throne itself might suffer some despite: Not so the Cid: that man was loyal born; My kinsman. He shall wed you!’ Straight he wrote: ‘Cid, at Palencia seek me at your earliest, There to confer on things that touch the State, Likewise God's glory, and your weal besides.’ Incontinent to Palencia rode my Cid With kinsfold companied and many a knight; The King received him in his palace chapel, Vespers concluded but the aisles still thronged; Embraced him; then stepped back, and, gazing on him, Exclaimed, ‘Not knighted yet! My fault, my sin! I must redeem the offence! Good kinsman, kneel!’ High up the bells renewed their silver clamour; Ferrando knighted him: Ferrando's Queen Led to the gate his charger: the Infanta Girt him with spurs. Then gave the King command Like bishop missioning priest but late ordained, ‘That gift now thine communicate to others!’ Straight to the chapel's altar moved the Cid And lifted thence the sword of state. Before him Three youthful nobles knelt. He with that sword Their knighthood laid upon them. Masque and dance Lasted three days: then spake to him the King, ‘Cid—for that name by which all Spain reveres you, Albeit a title not by me conferred, I recognize well pleased—Donna Ximena, Heiress of Gomez slain by you of old, Warrior and counsellor dear to me and mine, Stands sore imperilled through that righteous deed, Her subjects in revolt and every knave Flouting her princely right. Revolts spread fast; Ere long my kingdom may lie meshed in such: I see the hand that best can deal with treason! My royal honour stands to her impledged That you—first wedding her—her lands your own— Should, in the embraces of your name and glory, Foster the tender weakness of her greatness. Wilt thou redeem that pledge?’ The youth, ‘This maid, King, is she good and fair?’ Ferrando smiled; ‘Glad am I that, as in my youthful days, Goodness and grace still reign; kings rule not all! Good she must needs be since her sire was good; Majestical she is: her suit she made As one who gives command; but you shall see her. Seek we the Presence Chamber!’ From a throng Of courtly ladies in the glory clad Of silver cloudland when a moon sea-born To pearl that silver turns, Ximena moved Calmly, not quickly without summoning sign, A sister at each hand in weeds night-black And stood before the King. No gems she wore And dark yet star-like shone her large, strong eyes, A queenly presence. All Castile that day Held naught beside so noble. Reverently The young man glanced upon her; glanced again: At last he gazed: then, smiling, thus he spake: ‘Forfend it, Heaven, Sir King, that vassal knight Should break his monarch's pledge!’ Ferrando next, ‘Maid, thou hast heard him: he demands thy hand.’ To whom, unchanged, Ximena made reply: ‘King! better far the whole truth than the half! That youth should know it. I demanded his: I deemed his hand my right. My rights have ceased; Now wife, not maid, my rights are two alone, Henceforth to love my Husband and obey.’ She knelt, and, lifting, kissed her Husband's hand. And next the King's; then rose and silent stood. Ferrando spake: ‘The day's a youngling yet, And I must see its golden promise crowned: Your bridesmaids and your bridal robes await you: Kings lack not foresight: all things are prepared.’ Ximena sighed: ‘So soon! Then be it so!’ An hour and she returned in bridal white With countenance unshaken as before, Yet brightened by a glad expectancy. The King gave sign: that company august In long procession to the chapel passed; Therein 'mid anthems sung, and incense cloud, The nuptial Mass was solemnized. Ferrando, Lowering his sceptre, gave the Bride away; Her little sisters smiled and wept by turns; The Cid adown her finger slipped the ring; The Bishop blessed them, showering upon both The Holy Water. From their knees they rose Husband and Wife thenceforth. Leaving that church Largess they showered on all. At once they rode To Bivar, where from age to age had dwelt The Cid's great race. Behind them rode their knights, Two hundred men. Before the castle's gate High on its topmost step his mother stood Girt by the stateliest ladies of that land In festive garb arrayed. Her daughter new Before her knelt; then, to her bosom clasped, Looked up, and, smiling, spake not. Spake my Cid: ‘Mother, if less than this had been my Bride Here had I tarried many a month and year; But this is gift of God in Spain His greatest, A maid taught nobleness in sorrow's school, Unmatched for courage, simpleness, and truth: Yea all her words have in them strength and sweetness. Now therefore, since God's gifts must first be earned, Not till five victories on five battle-fields Against Christ's foes have made her justly mine Inhabit I with her in castle or waste. Cherish her thou as thou didst cherish me; The laws of Honour and of Faith to her Teach as thou taughtest to me. Farewell to both!’ He turned, he lingered not, he looked not back; Westward he rode to combat with the Moors. Then spake another of those watchers sad, Count Gaspar of the Douro: Love is good; But good things live beside. That knew the Cid; That lesson learned I riding at his left Beneath his standard named ‘Ximena's Veil.’ Three days we rode o'er hill and dale; the fourth, The daylight slowly dying o'er the moor, A shrill voice reached us from the neighbouring fen, A drowning man's. Down leaped our Cid to earth And, ere another's foot had left the stirrup, Forth from the water drew him; held him next On his own horse before him. 'Twas a Leper! The knights stared round them! When they supped that eve, He placed that Leper at his side. The knights Forth strode. At night one bed received them both. Sirs, learn the marvel! As Rodrigo slept Betwixt his shoulders twain that Leper blew Breath of strong virtue, piercing to his heart. A cry was heard—the Cid's—the knights rushed in Sworded: they searched the room: they searched the house: The Cid slept well: but Leper none was found: Sudden that chamber brightened like the sun New-risen o'er waves, and in its splendour stood A Man in snowy raiment speaking thus: ‘Sleepest thou, Rodrigo?’ Thus my Cid replied, ‘My Lord, I slept; but sleep not; who art thou?’ He spake, and, rising, in that splendour knelt: And answer came: ‘Thy Brother-man am I, In heaven thy Patron, though the least in heaven, Lazarus, thy brother, who unhonoured lay At Dives’ gate. To-day thou honoured'st me: Therefore thy Jesus this to thee accords That whensoe'er in time of peril or pain Or dread temptations dealing with the soul Again that strong Breath blows upon thy heart, Nor angel's breath that Breath shall be, nor man's, But Breath immortal arming thy resolve, So long as Humbleness and Love are thine, With strength as though the total Hosts of Heaven Leaned on thy single sword. The work thou workest That hour shall prosper. Moor and Christian, both, Shall fear thee and thy death be glorified.’ Slowly that splendour waned away: not less Hour after hour the Cid prayed on. At morn Forth from that village forest-girt we rode Ere flashed a dew-drop on its lightest spray Or woke its earliest bird. Thenceforward knights Flocked daily to the Cid. Each month, each week The Impostor's hosts, with all their banners green Moon-blazoned, fled before him like the wind. Now champaign broad, now fortress eyeing hard From beetling cliff the horizon's utmost bound Witnessed well pleased the overthrow of each: Merida fell, Evora, Badajoz, Bega in turn; more late Estramadura. Fiercest of those great conflicts was the fifth: From that red battle-field my Cid despatched Unbounded spoil that raised a mighty tower O'er Burgos' church wherein he was baptized. Moreover, after every conquering march Huge doles he sent to Christian and to Moor; For thus he said: ‘Though war be sport to knights The tears of poor men and their beardless babes Bedew the trampled soil.’ His vow fulfilled, Five victories won, five months gone by, with joy Once more to Bivar's towers the Cid returned. There, at its gate, they stood who loved him best: On the third step—as when he saw them last— His mother and Ximena. First he kissed His mother, next Ximena. Musing sat, The legend of that Bridal at an end, Long time those watchers. Lastly rose a knight, The youngest of that company elect, Silent till then, and slender as a maid; With countenance innocent as childhood's self Yet venerable as a priest's grey-haired. He spake: ‘A bridal then, and now a death, A short glad space between them! Such is life! That means our earthly life is but betrothal; The marriage is where marriage vows are none. Lo there! once more the altar lights flash forth: That Widow-Wife, five months a Maiden-Wife, Kneels 'mid their splendour.’ Eastward moved the knights, And, kneeling near the altar, with the monks Entoned the Miserere. II. The Cid in Exile. Next night once more in that Cathedral keep Walled by its mother-rock the warriors watched: After long silence, leaving not his seat, At length there spake a noble knight and brave, Don Aquilar of Gabra: low his voice; His eyes oft resting on the altar lights, At times on listener near: ‘Sirs, all applaud the Conqueror: braver far Our Cid that hour when he refused the battle: I heard that tale in childhood.’ ‘Let us hear it,’ The others cried; and thus that knight began: Our King, Ferrando, nighing to his death, Beckoned the Cid and spake: ‘We two were friends; Attend my dying charge. My race is Goth, And in the brain, and blood, and spirit of Goth Tempest but sleeps to waken. I have portioned My kingdom in three parts among my sons, Don Sanchez, Don García, Don Alphonso, And throned my daughter in Zamora's towers: When bickerings rise, sustain my testament.’ He died; his son, King Sanchez, was a churl: One day he rode abroad: at set of sun Zamora faced him: many-towered it stood Crowning a rock and flinging far its shade O'er Douro's crimsoned wave. He muttered low: ‘Yon city mine, all Spain were mine.’ That night Thus spake he, careless seeming, to the Cid: ‘Ill judged my father dowering with yon fort A woman-hand. At morn search out that woman; Accost her thus from me: “My kingdom's flank Lies bare: it needs for shield thy city's fortress. I yield to thee Medina in its place Tredra not less.”’ Ill pleased, the Cid replied, Though reverent not concealing his displeasure: ‘Send other herald on that errand, King! Ofttimes, a boy I dwelt in yonder fort When lodged therein Ferrando and Urraca, And will not wrong your father's testament.’ King Sanchez frowned. Unmoved, the Cid resumed: ‘I take thy missive, King, and bring her answer, But proffer service none.’ At morn he placed That missive in Urraca's hand; she rose; And raised her hands to heaven and answered fierce: ‘His brother, Don García, he hath bound; His brother, Don Alphonso, driven to exile; Elvira next, my sister and his own, He mulct of half her lands; he now mulcts me! Swallow me, earth, if I obey his hest! Cid! thee I blame not, for I know thy heart! Forth with my answer to my traitor brother! Zamora's sons and I will die ere yet I yield her meanest stone to force or fraud.’ Then spake the Cid: ‘The answer of a queen, And meet for King Ferrando's child! Urraca, This sword shall ne'er be raised against thy right! My knighthood was in part through thee conferred.’ The Cid returned: King Sanchez stormed and raged: ‘This work is thine!’ Unmoved, my Cid replied, ‘True vassal have I proved to thee, O King, But sword against the daughter of thy sire I will not lift.’ King Sanchez: ‘For his sake I spare thy life! Henceforth thou livest an exile!’ Low bowed the Cid. Bivar he reached that night, And summoning all his knights, twelve hundred men, Rode thence and reached Toledo. Sirs, ere long God dealt with that bad man. Three days his host Fought malcontent: grimly they scaled the walls; Zamora's sons hurled on them stones and rocks The battlements themselves, till ditch and moat Thickened with corpses, and the Douro left Daily a higher blood-line on those walls While whispered man to man; ‘Our toil is lost, He spurned our best; what cares he for men's lives?’ Then from Zamora sped a knight forsworn By name Vellido Dolfos, crafty man, Fearless in stratagem, in war a coward. Like one pursued he galloped to the camp, Checked rein at Sanchez’ tent, and, breathless, cried: ‘King, I had slain thee gladly yesternight; This day a wronged man sues thee. Sir, revenge 'Gainst thy false sister is the meed I claim, Thy sister kind to caitiffs, false to friends! I know a secret postern to yon fort; It shall be thine this night.’ ‘Who sees believes,’ Sanchez replied; ‘That postern—let me see it!’ They rode to where the forest's branching skirt Screened it from random eyes. The King dismounted, And, companied by that traitor knight alone, Peered through that postern's bars. With lightning speed The traitor launched his javelin 'gainst the King; It nailed him to that ivy-mantled wall: Vellido through the woodland labyrinths scaped. The king ere sunset died. Don Sanchez dead, At once, from exile King Alphonso burst: The Cortes met: with haughty brow he claimed Allegiance due, like one who knows his rights, Full sovereignty, God-given, and not from man, Of Leon and Castile. They gave consent; At Burgos in procession long and slow The knights and nobles passed, and passing kissed Each the King's hand. Alone the Cid stood still. Astonished sat the King. He spake: ‘The Cid Alone no homage pays.’ The Cid replied: ‘Sir, through your total realm a rumour flies, And kings, all know, must live above suspicion— That in your brother's death a part was yours: Sir, in his day your brother did me wrong: I, for that wrong am none the less his vassal: Make oath, sir King, that rumour is a lie! Till then from me no homage!’ Silent long Alphonso sat: then ‘Be it so,’ he said. Next day he rode to Burgos' chiefest church, And there heard Mass. About him stood that hour His nobles and hidalgos: Mass surceased, Crowned, on a dais high, in sight of all Alphonso sat: behind him stood twelve knights: Slowly my Cid advanced, upon his breast Clasping the Gospels open thrown. The King Laid on them hands outspread. Then spake my Cid: ‘I swear that in my brother's death no part Was mine.’ Low-bowed, Alphonso said, ‘I swear;’ Likewise his twelve hidalgos. Then the Cid: ‘If false my oath, mine be my brother's fate.’ Alphonso said ‘Amen’; but at that word His colour changed. With eye firm-fixed my Cid Slowly that oath repeated; and once more The King and his hidalgos said ‘Amen!’ Three times he spake it; thrice the monarch swore: Then waved the standards, and the bells rang out; And sea-like swayed the masses t'ward the gates. Parting, Alphonso whispered to my Cid— None heard the words he spake. It chanced one day The King, from Burgos riding with his knights, Met face to face whom most he loathed on earth. With lifted hand he spake: ‘Depart my land!’ The Cid his charger spurred; o'er-leaped the wall; Then tossing back his head, loud laughing cried, ‘Sir King, 'tis done! This land is land of mine!’ Raging the King exclaimed: ‘Depart my realm Ere the ninth day!’ My Cid: ‘Hidalgo's right By old prescription yields him thirty days If banished from the realm.’ Alphonso then: ‘Ere the ninth eve, or else I take thy head!’ Low bowed Rodrigues to his saddle bow And rode to Bivar. Summoning there his knights Briefly he spake: ‘You see a banished man.’ They answered nought. Then Alvar Fanez rose And said: ‘With thee we live; for thee we die,’ And rising, all that concourse said: ‘Amen.’ The eighth day dawned: My Cid from Bivar rode; Whilst yet his charger pawed before its gate He turned, and backward gazed. Beholding then His hall deserted, open all its doors, No cloaks hung up, within the porch no seat, No hawk on perch, no mastiff on the mat, No standard from the tower forth streaming free Large tears were in his eyes; but no tear fell; And distant seemed his voice—distant though clear Like voice from evening field, as thus he spake: ‘Mine enemies did this: praise God for all things! Mary, pray well that I, the banished man, May drive the Pagans from His holy Spain, One day requite true friends.’ To Alvar next He spake: ‘The poor have in this wrong no part; See that they suffer none;’ then spurred his horse. Beside the gate there sat an aged crone Who cried, ‘In fortunate hour ride forth, O Cid! God give thee speed and spoil!’ They reached old Burgos At noontide, while for heat the dogs red-tongued Slept in the streets. The King had given command ‘Let no man lodge the Cid, or give him bread!’ As slowly on his sixty warriors rode And gazed on bakers' shops, yet touched no loaf The gentle townsmen wept, ‘A sorry sight!’ Women were bolder: ‘Vassal good,’ they cried, ‘To churlish Suzerain!’ The Posado's gate He smote three times with spear-shaft: none replied. At last beneath its bars there crept a child Dark-eyed, red-lipped, a girl of nine years old, Clasping a crust. Sweet-toned she made accost: ‘Great Cid, we dare not open window or door The King would blind us else. Stretch down thy hand That I may kiss it!’ At her word my Cid Stretched down his hand. She kissed it, hiding next Therein the crust, and closing one by one O'er it the mail-clad fingers. Laughed my Cid: ‘God's saints protect that shining head from hurt And those small feet from ways unblest, and send In fitting time fit mate.’ The sixty laughed: Once more the child crept in beneath the bars: They noted long the silver feet upturned With crimson touches streaked. That night my Cid Couched on a sand plain with his company The palm-boughs rustling 'gainst their stems thickscaled. Half-sleeping thus he mused. ‘Could I, unworthy, So all unlike that child in faith and love, Have portioned out that crust among my knights God might have changed it to a Sacrament And caused us in the strength thereof to walk Full forty days.’ Ere yet the bird of Dawn In neighbouring farm its earliest clarion rang The Cid had mounted; reached ere nones that haunt Wherein his wife had taken sanctuary, San Pedro de Cardena. At the gate He blew his battle-horn. They knew it well! Rushed forth Ximena and her ladies first: O what a weeping was there at his feet! Then followed many a monk with large slow eyes: The abbot long had wished to see the Cid; And now rejoiced: the feast was great that day And great the poor man's share; and chimed the bells So loudly that the King, in Burgos throned, Frowned but spake nought. Next day two hundred knights Flocked to the Cid's white standard. On the third, Ere shone its sunrise, by that Abbey's gate My Cid for blessing knelt, then spake: ‘Lord Abbot, Be careful of my wife, Donna Ximena, For princelier lady stands not on this earth Of stouter courage or of sweeter ways: Likewise breed up my babes in holy life; Thy convent shall not lack, and if I die God is my banker and will pay my debts.’ Next, to her lord Ximena with slow steps Made way, and knelt; and weeping thus she spake: ‘Sundered ere death! I knew not that could be!’ Their parting seemed like parting soul and body. Last came two ladies with his daughters twain. He took them in his arms: his tears fell on them Because they wept not but bewildered smiled; And thus he spake: ‘Please God, with Mary's prayers, I yet shall give these little maidens mine With mine own hand to husbands worthy of them.’ He said; and shook his rein, nor once looked back; And the rising sun shone bright on many a face Tear-wet in that dim porch. Then spake a knight Revered by all, Don Incar of Simancas With strenuous face, keen eyes, and hectic hand: A stripling I, when first that war began; Rapturous it was as hunting of the stag When blares the horn from echoing cliff and wood, And deer-like bound the coursers. Sport began Nigh to Castregon; next, like wind it rushed To Fita, Guadalgara, and Alcala, Thence to Heneres, and Torancio's plain, And the olive-shaded gorge of Bobierca. We crossed its dark-bright stream. A Moorish maid Sold us red apples, and from wells snow-cold Drew water for our mules. Our later deeds Fade from my mind. We captured castles twelve And raised the Cross upon them. Once dim mist Lifted at morn shewed Moors uncounted nigh; We stood in doubt. Our standard-bearer cried; ‘Sustain your standard, sirs; or if it please you, Consign it to the Moors!’ He galloped on; The dusky hordes closed round him. Torrent-like We dashed upon them! Soon the morning shone Through that black mass. The standard saved the host, And not the host the standard. Likewise this Clings to my memory trivial as it seems: At Imbra, when the Moors bewailed their kine Snatched from its golden mead, my Cid replied: ‘God save you, sirs! My King and I are foes. In exile gentlemen must live on spoil. What! would you set us spinning flax or wool? Not kine alone, but all your vales and plains Are ours by ancient right! To Afric back! This land is Spain—our Spain!’ That warfare past, My Cid addressed him thus to Alvar Fanez: ‘Cousin, betake thee to that saintly place, San Pedro, where abide my wife and babes: Raise first those Moorish banners in its aisles, Then noise abroad thy tidings. Greet with spoil That abbot old. Seek last the King, Alphonso: Give him his fifth: make no demand in turn; Much less request. I wait not on his humours.’ Alvar went forth: In fair Valladolid Ere long he met Alphonso with his train Half way betwixt the palace and cathedral Recent from Mass. The monarch—without greeting— ‘What means yon train of horses trapped in gold, And swords inwrought with gems?’ Alvar replied ‘Sir King, my Cid bestows them on your Highness, The fifth part of his spoil: for battles still He wins, and wide domains, and tower, and town. King, if the Cid but kept the lands he conquers Half Spain would be his realm. Content he is To hold them from your Grace in vassalage. Therefore restore him to your royal favour!’ Alphonso then: ‘'Tis early in the morn To take a banished man to grace and favour! 'Twere shame to stint my wrath so soon. For spoil, Kings need not spoil! Not less, since thus the Moors Are stripped, his work is work of God in part: Let him send still my fifth!’ Then laughing spake A humorous knight, Don Leon of Toledo: Ay, ay, our King can jest when jest means gold! Our Cid could jest with lions in his path! A hundred tales attest it: this is one: Here dwelt he long in royal state. One day It chanced, the banquet o'er, asleep he fell Still seated on the dais for the noon Was hot, while talked or laughed the noble guests Ranged as their custom was around his board; His palace held some guests beside hidalgos That day, and one from Afric, not a Moor; A lion's cage stood in the outer court; Its door was left ajar. Scenting the meat That lion reached at last the banquet chamber: The ladies screamed: the warriors drew their swords: The Infantes twain of Carrion most were mazed; The elder backed into a wine-vat brimmed Purpling the marble floors; the youngest crept Beneath the board to where the Cid was throned And quivering clasped his feet. The Cid awoke; Rubbed first his eyes; gazed round him; marked that lion; Advanced, though still half sleeping; by the mane Drew him obedient as a mastiff hound; Relodged him; barred his prison; re-enthroned His own brave bulk. The knights pushed back their swords: The Infantes strove to laugh: the ladies smiled; A priest gave thanks in Latin, first for meat, Next that that beast had failed on them to banquet; Ere ceased that grace my Cid again slept well; Sole time, men say, he ever slept at prayer, Albeit at sermons oft. Sir Incar next; Your boasters see not far! Fortune ere long On King Alphonso cast a glance oblique, For vassals weak and meek grew strong and haughty; And when huge tracts were flooded now, now parched, Men cried ‘our King is bad.’ That King sent gifts Suing the Cid's return. The Cid replied: ‘To others gifts! for me my lands suffice. My King commands my sword; my terms are these: “To each hidalgo thirty days, not nine, Shall stand conceded ere his banishment, And courts beside wherein to plead his cause. Next, charters old shall have their reverence old As though their seals were red with martyrs' blood. Lastly the King shall nowhere levy tax Warring on law. Such tax is royal treason: Thus wronged, the land is free to rise in arms.”’ Long time the King demurred; then frowned consent; And there was peace thenceforth. That day arose This saying: ‘Happy exile he that home Returning to his country, bring her gifts. His rest shall be in Heaven.’ No tale beside Succeeded. Sweetly and slowly once again From that remote high altar rose a hymn Tender and sad: that female train once more Approached it two by two, with steps as soft As though they trod on hearts—Ximena last; And star by star the altar lights shone out. The knights arose, and, moving t'ward the east Knelt close behind those kneelers. III. The Cid at Valencia. Once more the warriors watched: the first to speak A knight of splenetic lips though roughly kind, Don José de Maria, thus began: Sirs, some have boasted deeds if quaint yet brave, And some have lectured long of lesser triumphs The Cid's half jesting feats. Such chroniclers Because they shared those battles give them praise, Praising therein themselves. Valencia! there Flamed forth the man's true greatness like the sun!— The Moors' chief city, where their noblest dwelt In garden-girdled palaces 'mid palms. Seaward it looks t'ward every coast where waves Their prophet's flag accurst. Thus spake the Cid: ‘Valencia's King sent kinglings on a day When I, new wedded, hunted on his grounds, To visit me. We grappled; and they fled: Decorum needs that we return that visit.’ Pass we the lesser triumphs on his march. He took Valencia's suburb chief. Huge walls Manned by an army barred our farther progress; Our scaling ladders near them seemed like toys. The Cid encamped before them: missives sent: ‘Sirs, have your choice! or fight or die of hunger!’ But they had seen him in the field too oft To fight as once they fought. The Cid flung back With scorn their petulant sallies. Day by day Their stores were minished. Sorer week by week The anguish of their hunger. Many a Moor Rushed to our serried ranks loud clamouring, ‘Bread! ‘Make us your slaves, but feed our babes!’ At last An unexpected promise dawned upon them; The mightiest of the Moorish hosts drew near, The Almoravides; and Valencia's sons, Fools of a credulous hope, exultant cried: ‘To Allah praise! Yon Christian foe is doomed; Ere long their bones shall whiten vale and plain!’ So sang they, clustered on the city walls As twilight deeper grew, and plainlier shone The Moorish camp-fires far. Meantime my Cid Had given command to rive the dams and bridges And open fling the sluices to the sea, For prescient was the man and knew his foe Must cross a lowland wide. The sea rushed in; Twilight to blackness changed. The moon was drowned In plunging storm of hail and rain and snow: Emerging thence it stared on wandering floods From sea and river, and the mountain walls Whose torrents, glimpsed but when the lightning flared, Thundered far off. Vain were the Moslem vows, For countless prayers of Christians in all lands From Breton coasts to the utmost German forest And all that empire old of Charlemagne Meeting them, drave them past the heavenly gates Abortive shapes and frustrate. All night long The Moors down crouched upon their city bastions Clinging to tower and coign. At dawn came news! That Moorish force had fled; Valencia's sons When spread those tidings deemed themselves dead men; Yea, as the blind they groped about their streets, Or staggered on like drunkards; neither knew Each man the face of neighbour or of friend, But gazed at him and passed: at other times Old enemies clasped hands but spake no word; And some flung forth their arms like swimmer spent That sinks in black seas lost. Ten days went by; The famine spread till chiefs remote drew near Crying: ‘Thy vassals we!’ Four weeks had passed; Then rose a white-haired elder, prophet deemed, And famed for justice long, a silent man; For three whole years he had not spoken word Save thrice. He scaled Valencia's topmost tower, And while around its base the people thronged Made thus the lamentation of the City: Nine times he made it ere the sun went down. ‘Valencia, my Valencia! Trouble and grief Have come upon thee, and the hour decreed: If ever God on any place shewed mercy Now let Him shew it. For thy name was joy: All Moors that live their boasting made of thee. If God this day should utterly consume thee Thy doom is doom of pride. If those four stones The corner-stones that bind thy walls in one Could leave their dread foundations, and draw nigh And speak with stony mouth to stony ear, The burden of their dirge would be thy sin. Thy towers far-gazing see but woe. Thy river, Old Guadalever, from its course is bent, And all those watery ministers of thine Far-sluiced behold their channels choked with mud; Dried are the gardens green that sucked their freshness: The wolf and the wild boar root thy plantains down; Thy fields are baked like clay. Thy harbour vast, The mirror of thy greatness, and the marvel Of merchant princes, guests from every land, Rots thick with corpses; and above it far Drifts the red smoke from burning tower and town From coast to coast. Valencia, my Valencia! This is the death-cry from a breaking heart, Repent thee of thy sins!’ When sank the sun That burthen ceased. Then round that pillar's base Rang forth a mighty and a piercing cry; And headlong from it through the city rushed Women and men. Then first that saying rose, ‘Upon my right hand breaks the sea to drown me, The lion on my left to crush my bones: Behind me is the fire: before my face And all around, the hunger.’ From that hour Whoso had bread or grain in earth interred it Like wild beast that inearths its remnant spoil, And gnawed it stealthily—an ounce a day— With keen eyes glancing round. At last a beggar Groped his blind way into the market place And cried, ‘Give up the city!’ Straight that cry Ran through Valencia; and its elders rose And paced barefoot, and found the Cid, and knelt, And laid the City's keys before his feet: Right courteously and sadly he received them; Helmless he rode through silent streets, his horse With muffled feet in reverence for their woe; The Cross first raised he on the Alcazar's tower, Then freed the Christian slaves. Proclaim he made ‘Let all who will depart the city free:’ Two days sufficed not for thosè throngs forth-streaming: Thousands remained so well they loved that place; O'er these he set, alcalde of their race, That elder—Alfaraxi was his name— Who mounting to Valencia's topmost tower Had sung that city's dirge. Through that just man The Moors their tribute paid. Thenceforth his fame Drew thousands to the Cid. From that far East Whence came the Magi following still the star To Bethlehem's crib, drew near a wondrous man Close shorn and shaven, Don Hieronymo, On foot a monk, a warrior when on horse; Hating the Moors, he came to waste and slay them. My Cid received that priest full honourably, And gave him armour and a horse. Withal Bishop he made him of Valencia's city, With instant charge that every mosque should change Thenceforth to Christian church. The Cid next day Sent to San Pedro's Convent golden store And mystic gems; for well he loved that haunt Within whose balmy bosom dwelt once more His wife and infants twain—not infants now But virgins in the lap of womanhood. He sent command to speed them to Valencia: That missive read, they knelt and raised their hands Much weeping for great joy. The abbot old Wept also not for gladness but for grief Since much he loved them. Brief was his reply: ‘I send them, Cid: our convent year by year Will pray for thine and thee.’ A week went by; And now Ximena with her daughters twain Nighed to Valencia, and my Cid rode forth To meet her, helmed and mailed. Hieronymo, Who, clad in mystic raiment white and black, Followed Perfection, sent his clergy forth: That great procession met them, golden-robed, Three crosses at their head. Behind them trooped The knights, a glittering company. The Cid Rode at its head. Their Mother and those maids Leaped down and rushed to him with arms extended. Silent he clasped them each. At last he spake, Laughing like one who jests that he may weep not: ‘Enter Valencia! 'Tis your heritage! I hold it but in fief.’ Entrance they made Through streets with countless windows tapestry-hung And arches vine-entwined. Wondering, they marked Its gilded minarets, and high palace fronts Mosaic-wrought. At last they reached that tower, The same which heard so late the prophet's dirge. They clomb its marble steps. To the West they saw The city's myriad gardens fountain-lit; Eastward the sea. They knelt and sang ‘Te Deum’; And from the vast and marvelling mass beneath The great ‘Amen’ ascended. Sirs, a tale For children made might here find happy end; But life, a teacher rough, when all looks well Genders its tempest worst. Winter went by With feast and tourney rich. Spring-tide returned: A sudden flame of flowers o'er-ran the earth; To see that sight, they clomb again that tower: What met their eyes? A spectacle unlooked for! The horizon line was white with countless sails. The Cid but smiled: ‘I told you not of this, A sorry seasoning for your winter banquets, But knew it well. In far Morocco sits The Emperor of the Afric Moors. Yon fleet Wafts here his son, with thirty kings all vowed Their steeds to water in our Holy Wells Then stable them in every Christian church: What sayst thou, lady mine?’ Ximena spake: ‘How many come they?’ And the Cid replied ‘Full fifty thousand; and five thousand ours!’ Death-pale his daughters grew and silent stood: Ximena made reply, her large black eyes Dilating at each word, ‘What God inflicts Man can endure.’ That moment strange eclipse Darkened the sun; and from that fleet storm-hid The Arab tambours rolled their thunders forth: The Cid but stroked his beard, and smiling said: ‘Daughters, take heart! The larger yonder host The shamefuller their defeat; our spoil the greater! I promised you long since good mates in time: This day I promise you fair marriage portions!’ He turned; not once again he sought that tower: Not once he sallied from Valencia's wall Till the last Moor had landed. Sirs, to the end! There where we fought we triumphed; but at last Our springs of water failed us: then it was Our Cid put forth his greatness. Earliest dawn Was glimmering sadly under clouds low-hung When, in San José's, Don Hieronymo Sang Mass. He gave the absolution thus: ‘This day whoever, Christ's true penitent, His heart with God, his face to God's chief foe, Dies for his country, that man's sins shall fly Backward in cloud; his Soul ascend to heaven!’ The rite complete, that Perfect One exclaimed: ‘A boon, my Cid! Your vanguard's foremost place! God's priest should strike the earliest blow for God.’ The Cid made answer: ‘Be it in His name!’ Then Alvar Fanez thus: ‘Concede me, Cid, Three hundred knights that we may bide our time Within that bosky dell of Albuhera: The battle at its fiercest, we will on them!’ The Cid replied: ‘In God's name be it so!’ Ere day with knights five thousand forth he rode, And, curving round through by-ways in the woods Dashed on the Moorish rear. New risen and 'mazed, They deemed some second host was in among them. That second host was Don Hieronymo With all his vanguard. ‘Smite them,’ still he cried, ‘For love of Charity!’ The battle flame Upsoared and onward ran like fire o'er woods: Great deeds were done that day and many a horse Lacking a rider spurned the blood-red plain That flashed with broken breast-plates and with helms; And now the Moor the Christian now prevailed, And all the battle reeled as when two storms Through side-way valleys met in one black gorge Wrestle and writhe commixed. That day the Cid Seemed omnipresent, so the Moors averred; They sware that on his crest a fire there sat And shone in all the circlings of his sword, His stature more than man's. Not less in mass Their dusk battalions hour by hour advanced: Numbers at last prevailed; and here and there The Christian host fell back. At once my Cid Cried to his standard-bearer, ‘Scale yon rock, And wave around thy head my standard thrice!’ Forward the standard-bearer rushed. That hour The monks in far San Pedro's Church entoned Their customed matin song and promised prayer For him, the man they loved. The standard-bearer Waved thrice his standard from that craggy height, And, as he waved it, shouted thrice ‘My Cid’ With sound as when the Fontarabian cliffs Re-echoed Roland's horn. Swifter than moon Fleeting 'mid stormy hill-peaks forest-girt, That host by Alvar Fanez hid forth dashed And flung themselves upon the Moorish flank, Three hundred spears. The Moors were panic-stricken; Ere long, half blinded by the westering sun, They broke, and headlong toward the harbour fled: Then jesting cried my Cid, ‘The day declines; The sun must not go down upon our wrath. For that cause, Christians, smite, and smite your best! Your battle-axe be on them till yon orb Shows but one star-like point!’ That point evanished The fugitives reached the sea. Three times that hour My Cid closed up upon the flying king, Yucef, and three times smote his shoulders lithe; Half dead he reached his ship; but as he leaped My Cid flung after him the sword Colada;— It left its mark upon him till his death, Then sank in sea; next day a diver raised it. Twelve thousand perished there in ship or wave. That evening through Valencia's stateliest street, That Perfect One, Hieronymo, beside him, Bare-headed rode the Cid. Like creatures winged Ximena and his daughters rushed to meet him And kissed his hands and kissed Bavieca's neck; Great feast was in the palace held that night, And in the churches great were the thanksgivings And great the alms bestowed upon the poor, Christian and Moor alike. Ere long within Valencia was fulfilled That vow the Cid had vowed: ‘Though exiled now, This hand will give these babes to worthy mates,’ For thither, drawn by rumours of their charms, Great princes flocked. In after times these maids Were queens: The elder throned in Aragon, The second in Navarre. Don José ceased: Then shouted loud Don Ivor of Morena With hands high holden and with eyes upraised, ‘O Cid, my Cid, how glorious were thy days! How many a minstrel sang thee in far lands! What greetings came from kings! The French king thus, “Hail, Cid, no king, yet prop of all our kings! In vain Charles Martel with his Paladins Had trod the Crescent down on Poitiers' plain Thy later aid withheld!”’ Then rose once more That youngest knight and slender as a maid Who on the earliest of those knightly vigils Spake thus, ‘Our earthly life is but betrothal.’ Again he spake: The Cid's most happy day Was one that neither brought him gift nor triumph: The day when came to him that silent man Whom from the first his heart had loved and honoured, The Alcalde Alfaraxi—he of whom Hieronymo had said, ‘Watch well yon man, For when he speaks he'll teach us lore worth knowing.’ That day he sought the Cid and thus addressed: ‘Sir, I give thanks to God Who sent you here! Here dwelt my forefathers: I loved this spot; The Christians took me captive yet a child, And taught me their religion: but my kin Ransomed me later; with their seers I bode And won from them all learning of the Moors; Yea, zealous for their Prophet's law was I. Now, sir, a man of silence, musing long, And measuring Christian Faith with Moslem Law, Albeit on many loosely hangs that Faith Else I had been a Christian many a year, My sentence is with Christ and not Mahomet;— I will to be baptized.’ Then laughed for joy My Cid: he kissed that Moor, and caught his hand And led him straight to where Ximena sat Crying, ‘Rejoice! The Alcalde is our brother!’ Ximena heard, and rose, and, like her husband, That Christian kissed, and largess sent to shrines, And decked the palace gates because God's Church Is Gate, as all men know, 'twixt earth and heaven; And on the morn of Holy Saturday The font new-blessed, when leaped therein once more ‘God's creature, water, holy and innocent,’ His god-mother was she. From that day forth Gill Diaz was his name. That eve my Cid Whispered a priest, ‘I often mused why God Had sent me hither, not some worthier knight: Perchance 'twas but to serve one silent soul!’ In three months more Gill Diaz was a Saint. He taught the Cid to rule the Moors with kindness Judged by their proper law. They loved that Cid For gracious ways in peace, though fierce in war, And ofttimes when he passed the gates cried loud, ‘Great Cid, our prayers attend thee!’ The young knight ceased. Then glittering from afar, Again before the Altar shone the lights: Again Ximena 'mid their radiance knelt; Again arose that saintly ‘Miserere’; Again those warriors joined the rite august. IV. The Death of the Cid. The latest of those watchful days had come: The Knights still held discourse of ancient times And wonders of the Cid. At last arose A man silent till then though restless oft, A silver-haired Castilian flushed of brow: He spake like one that hides his grief no more. ‘Sirs, ye converse of things long past as present, For still ye laud the Cid who rests with God And, angel-praised, regards not praise of man, Yet near things see through mist. Sirs, look around! Morocco's Soldan knocks against your gates; His navies close your ports; his hosts this hour Thrice number those our Great One chased whilome. To business, sirs! A week, and of those present Few will survive, I ween.’ To him replied That youngest knight who at their earliest watch Had said, ‘Man's earthly life is but betrothal.’ ‘Sirs, it had ill become us, warriors vowed, Had we discoursed of danger ere our dirge O'er greatness dead had reached an honest end. That done, devise we how to save the city.’ Then laughing cried, with hands together rubbed, That mirthful knight, Don Leon de Toledo: ‘Devise we counsel, sirs! but wot ye well Counsel is bootless if the counsellors Be men of rueful face. Such face, moreover, Insults our Cid, to whom all wars were jest And jest at times was sermon in disguise: Glad man was he—our Cid!’ Don Sanchez then: ‘Supreme of jests were this: to place our Cid, Though dead, upon his horse with face to foe! Santiago! but to hear his laugh in heaven! The rogues would fly!’ To him Don Aquilar: ‘Brother, your jest was to our Cid no jest, But serious thought. In sickness twice he cried: “For this alone is Death a thing unwelcome, It stays us from the Moors! Should ill confront us When dead I lie, set me upon my horse; This arm shall smite them still!”’ Don Ramon next Know ye no more? Ximena told me all. The Cid, Morocco's navy full in sight, Confessed to her that peril till then unknown Compassed the Christian cause. ‘Bucar,’ he said, ‘Nursing five years his rage, stirs up this day The total hosts of Barbary against us. What if our pride of late, or sins beside, Invoke God's chastening hand?’ That fleet arrived, He, sickness-stricken, cried aloud, ‘Ah me, That I should live unprofitable this day! Raise up, great God, some nobler! Let him walk Thy knight elect!’ Distressed he lay that night, Tranquil at morn. He spake: ‘Fear naught, Ximena! There came to me last night trial unknown— Pray God it come no more! A trance fell on me That was not sleep. Before me sat a man At sunset in an ancient castle's hall: Low-bent his forehead rested on his hands: At last he raised his head: it was my sire, The man I ever loved the best on earth: Sad image seemed he of that speechless woe His when his race and house had suffered shame. An age methought that dreadful trance endured. Sudden, like breeze from Pyrenean snows, Some Breath Divine transpierced my heart:—that Breath Which cheered me oft at danger's worst. I heard “Be strong! When night is darkest day is night!” Then all my palace filled with wondrous light And from that splendour issued forth a Man Hoary but strong—two keys his girdle bore. He spake: “Regard no more yon host, for God In thirty days will call thee to His peace Because thou serv'dst Him with true heart though frail, And lov'dst right well my convent of Cardena. Thy God will not forsake thee! Like a mist The Moor shall vanish; and thyself, though dead, When Spain's high Patron fights that final fight, Shalt share his victory for thy body's honour. Likewise that day thou diest the Power accurst Shall fall in Holy Land; the Faith be free: The Cross of Christ shine forth from Salem's towers: And Bullogne's Godfrey live God's knight elect, Fulfilling thus thy prayer.”’ Thus spake the Cid, and ceased. Ximena fixed Her eyes upon him. Then the Cid resumed: ‘The body's weakness is the Spirit's strength. I saw these things, and more: he came to me, That boy all beautiful we lost in youth. You too shall see him soon.’ Again he mused, and sudden ended thus: ‘Would God that when that final battle joins, The strength of men might place me on my horse Facing the Moor; for God, methinks, that hour Will work some great deliverance for mankind; Also the greater then will be His praise When all men cry, “'Twas God, and not our Cid, Conquered of old: now through the Dead He conquers.” But let these things be done as they deem best— Hieronymo, that Perfect One, and these My cousin Alvar Fanez, and Bermudez. Gill Diaz I ordain for charge of thee.’ Then spake that slender knight and meek as maid: Sirs, rest assured that wish was not pride-born, Since what could be more humble than his death? He bade them bear him to St. Peter's Church, There entering, spake: ‘I suffer none to mourn; Sirs, all that live must die; but know ye this: Christian who goes reluctantly to God Is like a soldier who hath ta'en a city Yet fears to enter it and hail his lord There new-enthroned and crowned.’ Full reverently Then at the Bishop's feet he knelt, and there Humblest confession made and was assoiled. They that stood nigh in circle heard his words:— Great scorn had still our Cid of all concealment: The words he spake they heard. Don Sanchez last: Sirs, in this matter God hath shewn His will By manifest signs. Regard our Cid! He sits Beside yon altar, changeless. Sirs, attend! What time Valencia fell, for months, for years Far nations sent him gifts; Persia's arrived The last with camel train and long procession. ‘Can Moslem love a Christian?’ was our cry! Sirs, of her gifts the chief, ye know, was this, A golden Vial, and around it graved Inscription strange which no man could decipher Knight, clerk, or stranger. Don Hieronymo At last confession made: ‘God sent that Gift, Not man: and God its import will divulge When most our need.’ This likewise, sirs, ye know, That when that Moor who sang Valencia's dirge, The Alcalde Alfaraxi, Christian made, Was shewn that Vial sealed from Moslem eye, He, sage in Persian lore, the inscription read: ‘The body of the just man, ere his death Washed in this balsam shall not see corruption:’ Sirs, in that balsam was our Great One washed Ere yet he died and hath not seen corruption: Therefore 'twas God, we know, who sent that Gift! He sent it that our Cid, the Elect of God, Should triumph in his death. The battle-field, Sirs, shall attest my words! Then rose the cry, ‘Place we our Cid upon his horse, Bavieca, Full armed, and with his countenance to the Moor, Leaving the rest to God.’ That Perfect One, Hieronymo, next day approved their word, And Alvar and Bermudez; and, God-taught, Devised how that high thought should stand fulfilled. Throughout that day the Christians knelt in prayer— Prayer great and strong. When pealed the midnight chime The twelve side altars of St. Peter's Church Glittered with lights; and, hour by hour, at each In swift succession Mass on Mass was said Low-toned by priests that came like shades then passed With chalice veiled adown the darkling aisles. At earliest day-break Don Hieronymo, Before the great high altar standing sole Offered the all-wondrous Sacrifice Eterne With absolution given: and all the knights, Four thousand men, kneeling received their Lord Then bent long time their foreheads on the ground: At last they rose with sound as when sea-winds Blow loud on piny hills, and by that gate Named ‘of the Snake’ forth from the city rode Full slowly and in silence. At their head Upon his horse Bavieca rode the Cid With awful, open eyes, and in his hand His sword, Tirzona, pointing to the skies, Upon his right hand Don Hieronymo, His left, Gill Diaz, holding each a rein. Here follows in that sacred legend old The greatest battle ever fought in Spain, Though brief, ‘God's Battle’ named. The Chronicler, Writing for men who inwardly believed God made the world, and rules it, fearless wrote, And this his record. Morn by morn, twelve morns, Morocco's host had stood before that gate Shouting defiance and their prophet's name, And, no man answering, mused, ‘The Cid is dead’; But when that morn they saw the Cid advance Slowly, his knights four thousand in the rear, Fear fell upon them whispering each to each, ‘He died not! Traitors lied to lure us hither, Then slay us like one man!’ Others averred, ‘He died; but God hath raised him from the dead!’ Nearer he drew: distincter grew his face: Panic divine fell on them. Mists of death Cumbered their eyes: each heart was changed to ice: The knights four thousand shouted ‘Santiago!’ They fled. King Bucar launched on them fresh hosts In fratricidal war. The Cid and his Meantime on-moving, reached that fountain cold Akbar by name, begirt by palm-trees seven— An Arab saint, men said, had rested there— Therein, his wont, Bavieca quenched his thirst: That done, Gill Diaz turned him towards Valencia: At last no farther would he move, but stood With forward-planted feet, and head forth held, Eyeing the battle plain. Again he saith, That Chronicler, the Moors, their panic spent, Surceased from that their fratricidal war While prophet bald, grim seer, and fakir fierce, Nursed on mad visions 'mid Arabian peaks Rushed through the red ranks with uplifted hands Exhorting and denouncing. Bucar well pleased Watched from his height the lulling of that storm And hurrying up with all his great reserves Missioned long since from every Afric coast, Tremessian, Zianidian, or Tunisian Whate'er vexed Syrtes kens o'er raging waves Or Atlas through grey cloud—with these begirt, Their dazzling chivalry and standards green, Himself in midst of those late-warring hosts With crown imperial and with sceptre gemmed Sudden appeared, nor stayed, but vanward passed Assuming sole command. Back rushed the Moors Now formed anew, to where the Christian Knights Waited unmoved though destined as might seem To certain death and swift, and waiting raised Once more Spain's shout of onset, ‘Santiago!’ 'Twas heard in heaven! The eyes of either host Were opened, and they saw the Hills of God Round them thick-set with knights innumerable On snow-white steeds and armed in mail snow-white; Their Chief a wondrous One with helm cross-crowned Who bore upon his breast a bleeding cross And raised a sword all fire. The Moslems fled; Their Soldan first. Later they sware the earth Upheaved like waves had hurled them t'ward the sea. That flight was murderous more than battle's worst: Whole squadrons perished trampled under foot; Not once they turned on those four thousand knights Loud thundering in their rear. The harbour reached, Thousands lay smothered 'mid the ships or waves By their own armour cumbered to the death— Among them kings eighteen. The rest made sail With Bucar to Morocco. Never again That Soldan looked on Spain. The rising sun Shone fair next morning on Valencia's walls As from them moved a solemn pilgrimage— Spain's greatest son upon his horse world-famed, Borne slowly t'ward San Pietro di Cardena. Upright he sat: upon his right hand walked His Wife, and on his left Hieronymo Behind them priests intoning gladsome psalms. Each evening as they neared their place of rest Its bishop and his priests approached cross-led, With anthem and sad dirge. The second day The Donna Sol, his daughter eldest-born Beside her Aragonian lord drew near, And knights a hundred mailed, with shields reversed Hung from their saddle-bows. Wondering they gazed So awful looked that dead man yet so sweet, His household standard o'er him, and his knights Not funeral-garbed but splendid as beseems High tournament or coronation feast. Not thus the Donna Sol. Her glittering tiar She cast on the earth and wailed. Ximena then: ‘Daughter, you sin against your Father's charge; Lamentings he forbade.’ Then Donna Sol Kissed first her father's hand and next her mother's, And answered low, ‘In ignorance I sinned.’ Elvira, youngest daughter of the Cid, Next morning joined them with Navarre, her husband: Silent she wept, knowing her father's will. Day after day great companies drew nigh With kings among them regnant in far lands, Blackening both vale and plain. At last the Cid, Faithful in death, reached that majestic pile So loved by him, San Pietro di Cardena: The abbot, aged now a hundred years, And all his monks before the portals ranged Received him silent. King Alphonso dwelt That season at Toledo. In sombre silence He hastened to those obsequies of one By him so long revered, so scantly loved And yet to him so helpful at his need; Long time he stood a-gazing on the dead: At last he spake: ‘Spain ne'er had man like that man, Saw never knight so loyal and so true So gladsome, simple, holy and brave and sage. 'Twas well for me he never knew his greatness! In heaven they'll rise to meet him!’ Six whole days He graced the Cid with vigils and with rites Befitting Christians dead. He willed besides To lay him in a golden coffin gemmed Beyond the funeral pomps of Spanish kings. Ximena would not. Once again the wife Stood up as stately as the maid that stood Before Ferrando, making then demand ‘Let him who crushed my father's house restore it!’ As calm she answered now that monarch's son: ‘It shall not be! There let him sit enthroned, For many a throne throughout his stormy life My husband spurned, thus answering, “Of my sires No man was king.” Look there! There sits, not lies, The man, not king, who propp'd the thrones of kings— There in that house which roofed his exiled babes: There let him rest.’ Alphonso at her word Sent to Toledo for that ivory chair Raised on a dais where the Cortes met Yearly, whereon till then had no man sat, The kingly symbol of an absent king, And reared it at the right of Peter's altar And spread thereon a cloth of gold impearled, And o'er it raised a wondrous tabernacle Azure, gold-starred, and flushed with arms of kings The blazonries of Leon and Castile Navarre and Aragon, and with these the Cid's: And on Saint Peter's day the King Alphonso, The Infantes of Navarre and Aragon, And Don Hieronymo, in sacred state Throned on that chair the Cid, and round him spread That purple robe the Persian Soldan's gift, And reared within his grasp his sword Tirzona, Whereof the meaning is the ‘Brand of Fire’— Not bare but sheathed since now its work was done; Upon its hilt was graved ‘Ave Maria’: Likewise before his feet that earlier sword They laid, Colada, graved with ‘Yea’ and ‘Nay’ At either side its blade; since plain of speech The Cid had ever been. Thenceforth till death In that magnific pile Ximena dwelt, Watched by her husband's latest friend, Gill Diaz, His latest yet most honoured, most beloved, Serving the poor of Christ. Long nights she knelt In prayer beside her lord, lest aught ill-done Or left undone might bar him from God's Vision, Though restful with those Saints who wait God's time In that high paradise of Purgatory Sung by the Tuscan, where Eunoe flows And Lethe, and Matilda gathers flowers. Four years fulfilled, in peace and joy she died. Three days before her death she spake these words 'Twixt sleep and waking to her maidens near: ‘I go to be at last in heaven his Bride With whom I lived in troth not spousal here.’ Gill Diaz yet remained. Daily he led His master's charger—no man rode him now— To where beside a cross a spring uprose Fresher than Akbar's 'mid those palm-trees seven: O'er it the old charger bent. Full many a time There standing, though with thirst unsatisfied, Troubled he lifted up his ears and listened, And when he heard his master's voice no more, Sighed and moved on, deject. Two years he lived, Then died. Before that monastery's gate Gill Diaz buried him, above his grave Planting two elms, and dying, gave command, ‘Beside Bavieca's grave in turn be mine, Because both knew to serve.’ Here maketh end That book world-famous, the ‘Cid's Chronicle,’ Writ by a king, Alphonso named the Wise Sage in all science and a Troubadour. Two centuries and a half the Cid was dead: Then sent Alphonso faithful men and true Through all the cities and the vales of Spain To garner up all relics old that song History or tale had treasured of that man Who was the manliest man that e'er shed tear, The tenderest man that ever fought in war, The lowliest man that e'er rejected thrones: All these that king into a garland wove. With England's Arthur and with Charlemagne The Cid hath place; and since he left this earth He rests and reigns among the Blest in heaven. POPE HILDEBRAND BESIEGED IN THE CASTLE OF ST. ANGELO BY THE EMPEROR HENRY IV. (A.D. 1084.) Hugo, Hugo, Abbot of Cluny, was the chief friend of Pope Hildebrand these words may never meet thine eyes:— What then? My thoughts may reach thy heart not less I watch thee kneeling under Cluny's vaults; Then write; then pace once more my fortress prison, St. Angelo, of old great Adrian's tomb, Adrian, the sagest of Rome's emperors The man who, dying, questioned of his soul In song half sad, half gay. Those Pagans old Had in them valorous stuff. Had they been Christians Among them many had been of Christian mould Manlier than some we boast. He guessed not, Hugo, A spiritual kingdom clasping earth one day Would find its centre here where sat so long The Prince of this world crowned! The City's roar From all its hills shakes ever these grey walls Or crash more piercing as the roof-tree drops Of palace, fane, or keep. For leagues around Yon Infidel's watch-fires shoot their insolent glare; But scantly dimmed by flying flakes of March While houseless thousands crouch 'neath arches low Dead Diocletian's Baths or the Coliseum: God shield those helpless heads! This two-years siege Draws to its close. Think'st thou I faint among these woes, my friend? I tell thee, nay! A peasant's son am I, A nursling of snow-blasts on Tuscan hills Mocker since youth of winter bears and wolves. The wound's elsewhere:— Constantine's City, mother-city first Which raised salvation's sign o'er tower and dome, Gibbers schismatic drivel. Half the West Faithful to Faith is faithless to her Lord, And sells His Heritage for a mess of potage. O'er fields Christ trod the Impostor's crescent waves: Thence on to Nilus old. Ten years ago Thus to yon Emperor wrote I—‘Sin of thine Holds the wide East grovelling in dust this hour: The Emperor should have led God's armies there! The Emperor's naught. I, priest of God, will lead them. They wait the crosiered hand.’ Hugo, you smile: What smile like yours for mixed reproach and sweetness? Storming at priests corrupt I saw it not; But lavishly if I spake of Kings deposed 'Twas ever near, above or 'neath the surface. Plainly you warned me once: ‘You'll fail in much, Succeed in more. You'll win the Church's Freedom: There lies your limit. Kings are lion-cubs: God sees them ramp and roar, and bears with them: Fret not thyself!’ Hugo, God bears with them That they may weep their sins not triumph in sin. God's Church reveres true Emperors, true Kings; They hold from God: the Peoples must obey: But Kings are sworn to rule with truth and right: The King forsworn his people may depose him:— Two claimants these: both need an arbitrator And, free in choice, have chosen as such the Pope. Are Kings thus injured? Kings will cry one day ‘That arbitrator's hand raised but a sceptre; The popular hand an axe.’ Kings claim their rights: I claim His rights for God: All know His Church's freedom is God's right: That Popes are bound to guard it. Hugo, I grant This royal claim hath pretext. We are rich: Thence Kings are jealous; Kings are right thus far; Wealth wars as oft on freedom as on virtue; It wars against the Church's. That is ill. What then? We cannot choose the times we live in. The people will not see God's Church in rags; The barons will not venerate whom they fear not; These things will change. The Kings may win that battle: The worse for them: the Church will then be free, Both poor and free. Meantime my course is plain; To fight God's battle of the day; then pass. Hugo, a saint contemplative art thou: I am a sinner militant on earth: One time you warned me thus: ‘Though zeal be good The censor's fire may fall among the brambles, Leap thence on cedared crests of Lebanon, Consume their topmost branch.’ I liked that saying; I never loved the men most like myself; Contemplatives I loved: minds such as theirs Are more than action: barks of God are they Thought-laden all too deep for rapid keels. Such Intellect I lack:—it ne'er was mine With Athanasian insight to detect The slenderest rift in doctrine's mail: not mine Augustine-like, deep brooding, to subdue The old pagan wisdom to the Church's service, Or with Gregorian chaunt, Ambrosian rite To charm Christ's flock a-field— I am an arrow from the bow of God Sped at a mountain beast. Those vassal priests Call me a dreamer. Hugo, you are none, Have seen no visions. I can guess the cause: Your whole life long is intellectual vision, The seeing of the life of spiritual things; We, men of action, when beside our hand There lies no act, see visions. Once I saw them; Not since Life's battle closed around my steps. At Cluny was my first. You knew it not: Matins were sung: in chapter sat the monks You at their head. Your voice rang out denouncing Monastic sloth. I marked beside you close A vacant stall. Again I looked: and lo Within that stall with sorrowing face He sate Who wore the thorny crown: that hour He wore it, And on a parchment wrote with hand that bled: The words He wrote you spake. Another crash! Once more far roofs fall in, and flames rush up! Those archers know my casement. Fools, to know not Their shafts but glance from wall to roof! My foot Still snaps them as I pace. My friend, these things Are of the moment, not eternity: Such merit not long thought. What mean yon fires? This and but this. The men who love not Christ Love not His Church; and, loving not, abhor her. Christ only truly sees His Church's face: At times she wears a sable veil: then cries The world: ‘A widow is she, not the Bride!’ At times she wears a denser veil gold-woven; Then cries the fool: ‘The world hath wedded her!’ So prate the market babes! An Emperor that! An Emperor! Call ye that an Emperor? She, God's Church, made first the Christian Emperor. The thought was great: the hope but half fulfilled. How palpable the snare that marred that greatness! The Emperor needed not to be a King; Save for high cause should ne'er have been a King; His claims were Virtue, Wisdom, Strength: his crown The badge of Europe's soldier magistracy: His might was spiritual half; his sword but vowed Sin to chastise. The Church that—plagued by Rome For centuries—honoured Rome, her name, her law, That used her tongue in offices divine, She crowned her Emperor with his Roman title: She clothed him with dalmatic and with stole A canon of St. Peter's and St. Paul's, His name she honoured in the Mass itself! What more could she have done for him? This boy, What is he but a heathen king o'er-grown Who strives to build again the old Asian empire? I stand in this tomb-tower begirt with fires, Protector of the Peoples and the Kings Against his petulance—ay, but more, far more, Avenger of God's Kingdom. In thy grave Turn round, old Leo, of that name the Third, Whose hands high-lifted crowned thy Charlemagne; Roll 'neath those shaggy brows thine eyes o'er earth, And say if on it stand a prince this hour In whom thine eyes had seen an Emperor! Where hid they when for forty years at Rome Bandits usurping Peter's Chair— Canossa! The world will have the telling of that tale At last will yield it credence. To Canossa I bade not yonder boy; he came unsummoned: If there the frost wind bit him 'twas his choice; I bade him to depart. A year before I summoned him to Rome to answer charges; Reply he made not but convoked at Worms Gathering of bishops few and false; through these Deposed Christ's Vicar. I deposed the traitor: The German Kings my sentence ratified Unless within a year he purged his crime By frank submission made. That year nigh ebbed He rushed across the Alps; knelt at my gates; I knew him false; I saw his aim: 'twas this, My pardon won, the German league dissolved, To break his pledge and mock his feigned submission. This knowing I refused to see his face. Three days he beat my gates in sackcloth clad: The snow fell fast. At length through ceaseless prayer, Matilda's, ay, and, Hugo, thine, whose hands Had held the infant Emperor o'er his font, Against my word reiterate, prescient bodings, I bade him enter. At my feet he wept; Tendered submission; pledged eternal faith. Save for that fraud the lights of Candlemas Had seen his crown in the dust! He broke his vow: That morn which saw him to the Church restored He knelt within Canossa's castle chapel: I sang the Mass. In reverence low he bowed; I proffered him the Blessed Sacrament But added thus, ‘In pledge of faithful heart.’ Aghast he rose, and, pretext urged, forth fled. I fixed on him mine eye but spake no word. Ere passed six days that Emperor with a troop Waylaid my person. To the banks of Po He lured me on pretence of conference new: Hard riding saved my life. In this I erred: Three years I hurled not forth my final sentence: Three years a crowned transgressor shamed the world; Thereof there came much bloodshed. What if I For that cause fail to tread the Promised Land? God's will be done! Feet worthier far shall tread it: I see it—from this height! 'Tis strange, this stillness! The night is well-nigh spent: the fires burn low: 'Tis stranger yet, that stillness in my breast! Long years seem nought—I see my childhood's home, Saint Mary's Convent on Mount Aventine That overlooks half Rome. Again I note That white-haired monk draw nigh me; hear him speak; ‘Boy, where thou gazest gazed in years gone by Rome's oldest Augur, and King Romulus. Ravens eleven in slow, successive flight Sailed from the East. That Augur watched them long: Then spake: “Yon ravens, King, are centuries; Thy realm will last for centuries ten and one, Then crumbling, leave its cycle incomplete Since all is incomplete which is not God.”’ So spake that monk white-haired. I answered thus: ‘Ten centuries! thousand centuries fled, God's Church Will yet be in her prime!’ My youth gone by, A man way-worn again I stood in Rome; Again I trod those ivy-mantled halls Once trod by Sabine Numa, Cincinnatus, Camillus sage and just. I trod them oft: A breath passed o'er them from the patriarch days And made me, for brief space, a ruin-lover. The Basilics three taught me a nobler lore— The Lateran, the Vatican, St. Paul's: These said, ‘In ruins have not joy, for God Is of the living, God, and not the dead.’ The Imperial ruins never touched my heart; The Palatine sighed for pomps and pleasures gone: The Coliseum's crime seemed unatoned: History stood naked there and full of shames: The sins of princes living or late dead Interpreted the horror of the past: The present prophesied a fouler future: That Dead Sea of the ages dead which covers Those cities judged, the empires of old time, By strange upheavings notified, methought, Volcanic throes beneath. Daily I learned: I felt that all the forces deemed extinct Still lived in Rome, and strove in her. A whisper Ascended ever from the Catacombs; ‘It was God's future made that Roman past:’ A whisper found me from the Capitol, ‘King Romulus feared to read that Sibyl's tomes; The lost books shall be found.’ Lastly, from heaven A whisper fell; ‘Not vain the poor man's prayer! “Thy kingdom come” means this—the Church's triumph!’ I willed not to be Pope. Four Popes in turn This hand pushed front-ward when the popular voice Called me to Peter's Chair. I drave these four Successively on great attempts. At last God wrought His Will. That hour which made me Pope Temptation came to me till then unknown, A thought pride-born, ‘Build thou a Church to Him To whom the Saviour said, “Thou art the Rock,” A Church three times transcending Constantine's!’ Such act had warred against my true vocation And left my life a mockery. I was saved. The consecration past, all Rome rejoiced: The Coronation feast begun, a missive Was laid beside me by a hand unseen. Its words still haunt me, ‘Keep thine earlier vow: Make it thy breast-plate and thy diadem. Dream not that rearing Solomonian fanes Shall quit thy debt. Austerer tasks are thine. Lift thou God's besom in a stalwart hand And cleanse God's threshing-floor! Abase the proud: Be terrible to heresy and schism, More terrible to tyranny and greed: Trample the robber-brood with feet blood-red As His that treads His wine-press. Save God's Church Like Leo hurling back the Huns from Rome: So shalt thou live the lion of God's Tribe; So, life surceased, inherit on God's hills, Thine eyes fast fixed upon the Eternal Face, By Eden springs thine everlasting lair.’ Hugo, that hour it was my life began! That missive read, mine earlier aspirations Changed to resolves. They warred against three sins: The first was ‘Simony’—that leprous plague Which downward drags the Church's flesh, and leaves Her bones all glaring. Bishoprics themselves In public mart were sold like sheep or swine; The Spirit's gifts—the Spirit Himself, Who still Lives in His gifts. Men called it ‘Time's abuse:’ To such I answered, ‘Better sin the sin Than, tempted not, thus falteringly reprove it.’ The second of those sins, ‘Investitures!’ This Emperor's sire deposed three Popes, yet deemed He reigned Protector of the Papal Chair. What makes bad bishops but elections false? A prince, a layman, puts me forth his hand, And on the finger of the purchasing priest, Likeliest some comrade of his losel hours, Descends a ring! That priest stands up a bishop! O how unlike such prince to Charlemagne, So reverent to God's Church, or England's Alfred; All know his saying: ‘Kings are kings elsewhere; Kings in God's Church are simple citizens:’ Edward the Confessor made like confession. The strife was long! How many bishops holp me! In Germany but five; in Lombardy Seven and no more! Scandal the third—the last— Cleric concubinage ill named a marriage: The canons old and use of purest times Forbade the bond. A Sacrament is marriage, The image of Christ's bridal with His Church. God's Church hath ever honoured holy marriage, Banned all beside. There's nought so like that Church As hearth of peasant pure with children girt: Ay, but a celibate clergy is its fence! The unfaithful weds the mart, the farm, the shop: The faithful priest is wedded to his charge; I have heard such clerics cry, ‘We are not angels!’ I answered, ‘No, nor men, if, bound by vows, Ye lack the strength to keep them.’ Work and wait! The regulars walked as men by hemlock drugged But late, as now the seculars. Hope nigh dead A beam went through the mist. 'Twas Hanno's work: A sudden sickness seized him at Cologne, His pastoral charge. Within St. Martin's Church The monks sang matins. From his bed he crawled: Knelt at the casement, listened, made resolve; Restored, within a week he sped true monks To those fair convents twain, Siegberg and Saalfield: Reform descended on them hundred-handed And each hand sceptred! Fast the example spread; New convents rose; the sterner was the rule The readier loyal hearts to bow before it. ‘Touch thou thy mountain-tops, and they shall smoke.’ The hand of God had touched the heights. Ere long The lowlands caught the flame. Again I see them! O'er northern Germany the infection raced; O'er southern next, Suabia, Hungarian wilds, All hailed that great Reform. The Forest Black Clasped to its inmost heart the noble guest. Hirschau was next to claim it; three years sped, A score of monasteries owned her sway; Schaffaussen rose, St. Blaise; to these there flocked Princes and nobles worn in this world's strife True priests, and youthful knights. Whole villages Neighbouring those convents gloried in their rule, Echoed their hymns. In Vallombrosa's woods Against the storm-laid trunk the kneeling maid Pressed her pure bosom; children joined her prayer: Praying, the mason lifted course on course Unpaid, to breast the storm of centuries And flash the dawn unrisen o'er golden plains. I saw those sights: I heard those psalms through crash Of falling roofs this night. 'Twas these that kept A heart sore tried unflawed. This is my mission, To stand till death Reformer of the Church: Let none who love her vindicate abuse. Reform she needs, not once, but age by age For ever dying like our Alpine forests, Like them for aye renewed. She dies to live; Dies locally to sow by tempest winged The strong seed of her omnipresent life. Who are her foes? Who mine? Foul, merchant cities, Despotic monarchs, and false priests world-tamed: Who are her friends? The poor in every land, Devout men; youths high-hearted; feudal lords Honest and brave; the sons of Benedict;— Monte Cassino! Ay, 'tis she that aids me! She breeds me bishops, canonists, missionaries: This arm grows old: concede Thy Church, great God, A century of Benedictine Popes— These shall avenge Thy cause! I read this night By lurid lights Saint Chrysostom, thy words: ‘Not Heaven itself is stable as God's Church: She was not made for Heaven but Heaven for her: God said: “The heavens and earth shall pass away;” But of the Church He said, “Upon this Rock I build My Church. The gates of Hell shall never Prevail against it.” Think ye, sons of men, Its walls are walls of stone? I tell you nay: Its walls are multitudinous walls of Souls; Its pillars Spirit-Pillars based on Faith.’ I read: a Hand from Heaven was on my head: It stayed me where I stood. What man is he That wars against us? He too has a son: That son will strike that sire as he strikes me. The end draws near. Henry, I think, will fail: Guiscard, who wills me well, may prove worse foe: A flame is he ravening on all he meets, And liefer far to burn his best friend's house Than let his least of rivals scape alive. Long since there are that scatter lies against me; On me they charge these woes— I will not draw my sword against my people: If Rome, this present trouble past, revolts, With staff and book a pilgrim I depart Exile on alien shores. I think that I shall die beside the sea: I ever loved it: on its beaming marge I found no littleness. What brings this hour That image of Salerno's coast before me? I saw it first with him, its gentle Bishop: The amenities of that benign sea-clime About him clung methought. We paced that shore: Interminably before us spread the deep, All calm, all splendour, all beatitude. Thereon—far off—his eyes were fixed: more near, The unending breaker, high as castle wall, O'er-arching, and down-toppling fell in thunder. Armies confronting it had died the death. I touched his arm, and said; ‘Look nearer, friend!’ He mused; I spake: ‘God wills the death of none: God is all Love. Yet this is true not less, Through all the infinitudes of God's measureless Being Justice and Love are one. If men reject That Love, that Justice needs must mount against them; Fall—like yon breaker. 'Tis their will, not His.’ ST. FRANCIS AND PERFECT JOY. FROM THE FIORETTI DI S. FRANCESCO. ARGUMENT. St. Francis, walking one day from Perugia to St. Mary of the Angels, chief house of the Franciscan Order then newly founded, instructs Brother Leone as to that in which Perfect Joy consists.Blessed Saint Francis in the winter time When half the Umbrian vales were white with snow And all the northward vine-stems rough with rime Walked from Perugia down. His steps were slow, Made slow by thought; yet swift at times, for love Showered o'er his musings, fired them from above. Right opposite, high on Assisi's hill, The Saint was born, child of a wealthy house; And though corrupt delights abhorring still The revel he had shunned, and wild carouse Not less in camps and 'mid the festal throng At times the youth had lived; yet not for long. For from the Eternal Altar in the skies The Kingly Prophet and the Victim Priest Standing with hands out-stretched had bent His eyes One moment on him. Straight, from earth released, The Saint predestined cast her lures aside And Holy Poverty espoused—his Bride. Love, perfect made, lives in the Loved alone; All gifts by him unshared it spurns as dross; He who for earth's sake left His heavenly throne From earth accepted one sole gift—the Cross: That day Saint Francis on that Cross and Him Mused ever as he walked, with eyes tear-dim. At last thus spake he to that Brother meek For hours sole comrade of his silent way ‘Leone, lamb of Christ, the words I speak Write down and ponder well some far-off day; For truth remains; but men are winds that pass Like those brief gusts that bend yon stiffening grass. ‘Leone, we, the least of men, have striven An Order to uprear of Orders least; If God, who ofttimes from His feast hath driven The proud, and shared Himself the beggar's feast Should dower that new-born Order with such grace That one day it shall stand the first in place; ‘If in each land the Brothers Minor shone Resplendent with a sanctity so high That all men thronged to hear their word and none Who heard in mortal sin was known to die, All crowns of earth to this were but a toy; Yet write that this would not be Perfect Joy.’ Another mile that road ice-filmed they trod While sank the sun and 'gainst their faces blew Bitterer the blast; then stood the man of God And thus with kindling cheek began anew; ‘Leone, little lamb of Christ, attend! Write down my words and inly apprehend. ‘Leone, if through all the earth in fear Before the Brothers Minor demons fled; If in all lands they caused the deaf to hear The blind to see, and raised the buried dead All this, though greatness proof 'gainst Time's alloy And clear from stain, would not be Perfect Joy.’ Again pushed on the twain through vapours frore And wayside boughs curdled with frozen rain; But now Leone paced the Saint before And oft his whitening fingers chafed for pain; Again Saint Francis stood; and with a mien As though the Vision Blest his eyes had seen Resumed, but louder; ‘Little lamb, give ear! Write thus, that if the Brothers Minor flung All nets of knowledge round the spiritual sphere And spake once more each Pentecostal tongue, And depth on depth in Scripture hid explored, And dragged the Soldan bound to Christ, his Lord; ‘If, lastly, through all realms they sped His Faith Triumphant as on Angels' necks and wings And raised in Holy Land from shame and scath His just ones, abjects now of turbaned Kings Potent alone to abase and to destroy, These things, though great, would not be Perfect Joy.’ When three times now Leone thus had heard From lips so loved the self-same oracle He stood in wide-eyed wonder without word: At last he spake; ‘I pray thee, Father, tell What thing is Perfect Joy; how won? where found? In heaven do Angels share it with the Crowned?’ Blessed Saint Francis raised his thin, small hand And pointed to a chapel now not far That lonely rose amid the dusking land Backed by the dull red sky and evening star; Scarce larger than a huge tree's hollow bole That chapel seemed, their day-long journey's goal. ‘Saint Mary of the Angels’ it was named; That Order destined soon o'er earth to spread As yet no statelier Mother-House had claimed; Four hermits grey from Palestine, men said, Long centuries past those sacred walls had reared; Though time-worn, still they stood by all revered. Round them not yet had risen that temple graced With countless spoils from quarry and from mine Which clasps this hour 'mid splendours undisplaced That precinct old, its boast, its joy, its shrine, Delight of pilgrim bands that, year by year, Seeking its pardoning grace The Indulgence of the Portiuncula. in faith draw near. Still toward that spot the Saint held forth his hand— Ere long a cloud of mingled sleet and snow That seemed as on it drifted to expand Drew nearer to that humble fane and low: It passed; and plainly in the lessening light Shone out the chapel, now with snow-flakes white. Then spoke the Saint: ‘Leone, see'st thou there Our happy home? If we who left it late So bright, so glad, so silent, and so fair Should cower snow-clad ere compline by its gate, And sue admittance, crying, “Porter, wake! Receive thy Brethren for the Master's sake!” ‘And if that porter, loth to leave his bed, Should answer from within, “Impostors base! Come ye to gorge the olives and the bread Reserved for orphans and the sick? give place! This knotted staff for backs like yours were best; Hence! Psalms are over, and the Brethren rest:”— ‘And if, an hour gone by, once more we came And prayed: “Great Sir, unbar to us the door; Two Brothers Minor spent thy pity claim Wanderers way-worn, heart-weary, and foot-sore;” And he made answer: “Hence! for, though I sleep, For bandits masked my wolf-hounds vigil keep:” ‘And if, two hours gone by, again we sued And forth that porter rushed with staff and hound, Doubtless not knowing us in his Cain-like mood, And left us on the snows bleeding and bound, Till now on the blank road the morning shone, And we at heart had cherished petulance none, ‘Nor uttered contumelious word the while, But mused all night on Christ and on His Cross, And thanked Him that He deigned with us, though vile, To share it, gain supreme disguised in loss, And endless bliss won by an hour's annoy, Leone, Brother, that were Perfect Joy. ‘Leone! That, and every grace beside, Is gift of God to nought man boasts akin: Great sin it were to turn God's gifts to pride:— This gift, slaying self-love, forestalls such sin! Well cried the Apostle, pain-emparadised, “Glory in this I will—the Cross of Christ.”’ ROBERT BRUCE'S HEART; OR, THE LAST OF THE CRUSADERS. ‘This tediousness in death is irksome, lords, To standers-by: I pray you to be seated:’ Thus spake King Robert dying in his chair. His nobles and his knights around him stood Silent, with brows bent forward, He continued: ‘Because ye hath been loyal, knights and peers, I bade you hither, first to say farewell; Next, to commend to you a loyalty Not less but greater, to your country due, For I to her was loyal from the first. She lies sore shaken; guard her as a mother Her cradled babe, a man in strength his sire. Guard her from foreign foes, from traitors near, Yea from herself if evil dreams assail her. Sustain her faith; in virtue bid her walk Before her God, a nation clad with light.’ He spake; then sat with closed lids quivering oft; At last they opened; rested full on one The sole who knelt: large tears—he knew it not— Rolled down his face: 'twas Douglas. Thus the King: ‘That hour we spake of oft, yet never feared O best and bravest of my friends, is come. James, we were friends since boyhood; side by side We stood that hour when I was crowned at Scone,— Crowned by a woman's hand when kinsmen none Of hers approached me. Many a time we two Flung back King Edward's powers. Betrayed, deserted, By bloodhounds tracked we roamed the midnight moors: I saw thy blood-drops stain Loch Etive's rocks; Thy knees sustained my head when, faint with wounds, Three days on Rachrin's island-shores I lay. One night—rememberest thou that night?—I cried— Randolph, I think, stood near us,—thus I cried: “Give o'er the conflict! Bootless is this war: Would God we battled in the Holy Land For freeing of Christ's Tomb!” Then answer'dst thou: “Best of Crusaders is that King who fights To free his country slaved!”’ Douglas replied, ‘I said it, sire; God said it too, and crowned you. God, if He wills, can make you yet Crusader; In death Crusader—yea, or after death.’ The King sighed slightly, and his eyelids sank; Again he spake, though now with wandering mind: ‘Randolph was there. Rightly thou savedst his honour, Though breaking thus the mandate of thy King. He bade thee help him; but thine eye saw well He needed help no more. He won without thee.’ Again the dying King, with voice grown weaker, ‘Ah me! All earthly honour is but jest.’ Later his eyes unclosed; and with strong voice And hand half raised as if it grasped a sceptre He spake: ‘My youthful dream is unfulfilled— That sin I sinned, when Comyn died, forbade it: No less one tribute I would pay to God; Leave man one fair ensample. Yon case of silver is a reliquary— Seal thou therein my heart when dead I lie: In the Holy Land inter it.’ Three weeks passed, Five ships were freighted, and the Douglas sailed, Bearing that reliquary on his breast Both day and night. He fared not forth alone, For lords as many companied him as sailed With good Sir Patrick Spens, what time he bore Scotland's fair daughter, ‘Maid of Norway’ named, To be the North-King's bride. Those lords of old Saw never more their native land. They died,— Died at the feet of that sea-warrior grey When, tempest-wrecked on their return, their bark Went down 'mid roaring waves. Tempest as fierce On the head of Douglas broke. A Spanish port With inland-winding bosom bright and still Received him; and Alphonso of Castile Welcomed, well pleased, with tournament and feast A guest in all lands famed. The parting day Had almost come; disastrous news foreran it. Granada's Sultan with his Saracen host Had broken bound, and written on his march His Prophet's name in fire. Alphonso craved Aid of his guest. In sadness Douglas mused; At last he spake: ‘Sir King, unblest is he That knight whom warring duties rend asunder: My King commanded me to Palestine! For thirty days that word was in mine ears 'Neath all our festal songs. A deeper voice Assails me now, mounting from that great Heart Shrined on this breast. Thus speaks it: “That command I gave thee knowest thou not I countermand— I who from righteous battle ne'er turned back?”’ The Douglas drooped his head; a trumpet-peal Shrilled from afar. He raised that head; he spake: ‘Alphonso of Castile, my choice is made; With thee I march!’ The Scottish knights drew swords; Shouted ‘Saint Andrew!’ and the knights of Spain Made answer, ‘Santiago!’ Long or e'er Rose the next sun, and while the morning star Saw still its own face glassed in eastern seas, Its radiance saw flashed from the floods that, swollen By melting snows, thundered through dark ravines,— The hosts united marched. They met their foe On a wide plain with white sierras girt; The Moors were to the Christians three to one. For hours that battle-storm was heard afar; Numbers at last prevailed; and on the left The standard of the Cross some whit lost ground: Douglas restored the battle. On the right His Scottish knights and he drove all before them. The Moors gave way; fleet were their Arab steeds And better than their foes they knew the ground. Far off they formed anew; they waved again Their moonèd flags, and crescent scimitars Well used to reap the harvest-fields of death: Once more they shouted ‘Allah!’ Spent and breathless, The northern knights drew bridle on a slope A stone's-throw distant. Douglas shouted, ‘Forward!’ None answered. Sadly—not in wrath—he spake: ‘O friends, how oft on stormy war-fields proved! This day what lack ye? Nought save an example!’ Forward he spurred; he reached the Saracen van; He raised on high that silver shrine; he cried, ‘Go first, great Heart, as thou wert wont to go; Douglas will follow thee and die.’ He flung it: Next moment he was in among the Moors. The Scots knights heard that word; they saw; they charged. Direful the conflict; from a hill Alphonso Watched it, but, pressed himself, could spare no aids: He sent them when too late. The setting sun Glared fiercely at that fugitive Moorish host; Shone sadly on that remnant, wounded sore, Which gazed in circle on that Great One dead. His hands, far-stretched, still grappled at the grass: His bosom on that silver shrine was pressed: His last hope this—to save it. They returned, That wounded remnant, to their country's shores: Once more they bore the Bruce's Heart; yet none Sustained it on his breast. In season due The greatest and the best of Scotland's realm Old lords high-towered on river-banks tree-girt, Old Gaelic chiefs that ruled in patriarch state The blue glens of that never-vanquished land, Grave shepherd-prelates, guiding with mild awe Those flocks Iona's sons had given to Christ,— In sad procession moved with sacred rites From arch to arch of Melrose' holy pile Following King Robert's Heart before them borne Beneath a cope of gold, and there interred it Nigh the high altar. Peasants pressed around Countless that hour. Some whispered, ‘Meet it was Here, in this place, to inter our Robert's Heart; For though he never fought in Holy Land— He might not since for our sake God forbade it— That heart was a Crusader's.’ James of Douglas, In later ages named ‘the Good Earl James,’ Was buried in the chancel of Saint Bride's Near his ancestral castle. Since that day The Douglas shield has borne a Bleeding Heart Crowned with a kingly crown. There are who say That on the battle-morn, but ere the bird Of morn had flung far off that clarion peal Which chides proud boastings and denial base, King Robert stood beside the Douglas' bed With face all glorious, like some face that saith ‘True friends on earth divided meet in heaven.’ JOAN OF ARC. THE ARGUMENT. Joan was the daughter of a shepherd who dwelt on the northeastern frontier of France. As she kept her father's sheep Three Voices of Saints ever and anon conversed with her of things divine; but the Saints themselves she saw not. Later these Voices said to her: ‘It is God's will that thou should'st go unto Dauphin Charles at Chinon, and next deliver Orleans, and after that take the Dauphin to Rheims that he may be crowned King.’ These Three Tasks being accomplished, the Maid desired greatly to return to her parents, but was wrought on to fight yet longer. After that she was taken prisoner, and condemned to death as a sorceress. Then all France, reverencing great deeds and yet more her holy death, rose up and drove the invaders forth from the realm. She heard a voice well known, but saw no shape: ‘Maid, more a maid than all the maids of France Who ever kissed, then plucked, her fleur-de-lys, Leave on that bank thy crook of shepherdess, That lamb whose head is couched upon thy knee. Get thee to Chinon: heedless there abides Thy prince, a weakling 'mid a wanton court. Tell him that, since nor valiant man nor wise Avails to raise him to his father's throne, God lays on thee that mission—thee who ne'er Hast lifted sword, since strength is God's alone. To Vaucouleurs! There speak with Baudricourt.’ Then answered she whom all men called ‘The Maid,’ The slight, pale damsel with the naked feet, Red lips, red kirtle, visionary eyes: ‘The worthier see thy Face; thy Voice alone I hear, and oft have heard, and love it well, Saint Michael, Prince of all those heavenly Powers That hurled Rebellion forth from Heaven, I go.’ Then 'twixt the eyes she kissed her little lamb And laid it down; and on her homeward way She heard a second voice, yet nothing saw: ‘Maid, when thou seest that prince thou think'st on ever, Arouse his nobler nature speaking thus: “Sleepest thou, my Prince? If so, to me, a maid, Grant horse and arms! To Orleans I must ride; With me true men alone. Thy foes shall vanish; And France, that sign discerned, shall right thy wrong.”’ Listening that voice the maid had knelt. It ceased. She rose and spake: ‘Great Alexandrian Saint, Catherine! Full well I recognize that voice Which drew to Christ the famed Egyptian seers. Of all the legends in that blazoned book I love that tale the best. I see thee not; But when I hear that Voice I dream that Face, That smile which o'er it spreads, while slowly, slowly, That Babe, forth leaning from His Mother's arms, Adown thy finger draws His bridal ring. Thy mandate I obey.’ She walked once more; Not far: for soon a voice long loved had reached her. ‘Maid, when the foe hath fled before thy face, Orleans is free, ride thou beside that prince Who should be, yet who is not, King of France, To Rheims! and when the crown is on his head Give thanks; and to thy parents' roof return.’ Again the kneeler, rising, spake: ‘Great Queen, Thou too didst crown a King; for through thy prayers Winning thy lord, thou gavest his realm to Christ. Margaret of Scotland, I obey thy word!’ She spake, then sought, quick-paced with brightening eye Her parents' home beside its murmuring brook Its ‘fairy tree’—she oft had danced beneath it— And church five centuries old. She told them how those Voices, wont till then To say, ‘Work hard, be strong, be not a dreamer— Eternity suffices for repose—’ Their great behest, long promised, had imposed. Her parents bade her thrice repeat her tale. They liked it not. They willed her to remain And tend their flock. Not less they knew their child; Had ofttimes marked in her some touch divine, Oftenest when tendering alms, or rapt in prayer. They knew no wish for praise had touched her ever, The world for her existed not; ‘the body’— Hers seemed but ‘spirit draped.’ God and His Church, Her King, her country,—she had lived for these Her seventeen years. Oft seemed she younger far; For as, death past, the dead grow beautiful, And youth in part returns, tenderly thus Sleep dealt with her. Each night her lids scarce dropt When maiden face had changed to face of child, A child of twelve years old. At dawn of day The old Priest who best had known her bade her speed: She lingered long, back gazing. Thus she spake: ‘Ah, loving parents mine, how much I owe you!— Ah, little sister mine, thy loving heart Will beat no more 'gainst mine for many a night.’ To Vaucouleurs she passed; saw that brave man, Its ruler, Baudricourt. He never doubted; The maid was no impostor. Keenly he marked That ever with her soarings wisdom joined Insight with zeal. All northern France, he said, O'er-swarmed that hour with wild and wandering bands Lawless alike, all false, all sanguinary, That sang chivalrous courtesy, then fired Castle and cot alike. The old warrior spake With reverence, not with condescending kindness, With reverence such as eld feels oft for youth, Knowing how great a thing is innocence. He ended thus: ‘I am no preacher, Maid: Counsellors more sage, I think, have told you sometimes That strong illusions mock at times high aims. Yet this is true not less, that faith when humble Hath power to chase them. God hath given you faith: Pray God it walk beside you all your life, Sustain you at your death.’ The old man's eyes Grew misted as he spake that last word ‘death.’ She marked it and remembered oft. Next morn He blessed her, and they parted. On she pushed Through fields and thorny woodlands. Some aver That, tasked by stoniest paths, her slender feet Bled never, 'mid the miry showed no stain; That on green downs the lambs around her played; The bird sole-singing on the quivering spray Cheered her, while furry shapes peered out from holes: That cottage inmates gave her bread and placed Their infant in her arms and bade her bless it And watched her long departed. Yea, 'tis said A boy of six years old from hill to hill Tracked her six hours and more. On moonlight nights Her head oft rested on a wild-deer's flank. When flocked the hinds to Mass from field and farm Noting the corn-stacks near the household trees She wept, for still her heart was with the poor:— ‘Alas, must all their little humble store Be prey to fire and sword?’ The twentieth eve Her travel reached its term. Majestic Loire By sunset flushed rolled on in massive flood Solemn though swift. O'er it the countless towers Of Tours sent forth their tender vesper chimes, Echoes of vesper chimes in ages past That smoothed Time's pathway to eternity. She passed to Chinon's gates; then stood in prayer, Her wont ere yet she crossed each threshold new; For thus she mused, perchance some dying man Lies here; perchance some pretty babe new-born;— Then entered them unbid. A music strain Far heard, her guide, she passed from hall to hall, Some armour-hung to where rich doors flung wide Shewed a long gallery thronged by knights and dames. Some talked, some laughed; at times a lady held One finger o'er the chess-board hovering long, Then dropped it down on castle, queen, or knight, Yet hesitated still and marked whose eyes Pursued the ivory wanderer. At her harp Sat Agnes Sorel singing. As the song Soared from her lips the smile around them brightened And larger beamed her azure eyes. The Maid Glanced on her lightly, and, misliking, passed To where, with many near him, stood a youth In velvet black. Irresolute was his face Though delicately shaped. Not distant sat, Scarce marked, a lady pale that widow seemed; Yet was both Wife and Queen. The Maid addressed him: ‘God save thee, gentle Dauphin: may His grace Accord thee holy life.’ The prince replied— News he had heard of her from Baudricourt, And willed to test her—‘Maid, the King is yon!’ He spake, and pointed to a warrior tall And stately, starred with emblems of his greatness, Dunois, best soldier deemed that day in France. She answered: ‘Gentle Prince, that may not be; God tells me thou art King and not another.’ ‘Damsel, thy name?’—‘Men call me “Joan the Maid.” Dauphin, this word I bear thee from thy God, He yields thee back thy realm! God reigns: in thee He sees His France's heir.’ Again she spake: ‘Dauphin, provide me armour and a horse: At once the siege of Orleans I must raise, And later see thee crowned in holy Rheims. These tasks discharged my mission is fulfilled, And I, to happy lowliness restored, Clasp my young sister. This shall be the sign. Bend low that I may whisper.’ Near her lips, Red rose-leaves by light zephyrs agitated, He stooped his ear. Her whisper lasted long As when a young child says his ‘Ave Mary’ With recollection. Charles' cheek grew pale: He cried: ‘Of all who tread the earth not one Had cognisance of that vow! Maid, I believe! To Orleans with my standard in thy hand! At daybreak forth and conquer!’ Those hard by Clapped hands obsequious in enthusiasm. All save Dunois. In silence stood the Maid A little bowed with palms upon her breast; While Agnes Sorel glancing from afar With sideway forehead leaning on her harp In tone her royal lover could not hear Spake splenetic; ‘Yon girl's foot-bare! Alas! I fear those rushes hurt her dainty feet!’ Last Citaux's hoary Abbot rose; he spake: ‘Sir and my King, at Poitiers three days hence A spiritual Council meets honouring that field Whereon Charles Martel smote that Moslem host Else lords ere now of earth! That Maid send thither. They'll speak the truth as Martel fought for truth; No ambling half-breeds they!’ The King agreed, And she, that sad, sweet lady clothed in black Advancing clasped in hers the Maid's slight hands; Then looking on them said: ‘No ring; so best!’ Thus adding: ‘Maid, be guest and friend this night Of one not rich in friends.’ But near a casement— Through it a low wind brushed at times her harp— Sat Agnes Sorel with sad eyes averse Fixed on a glittering stream that girt remote Her little islet home ablaze with flowers, A place of tombs hard by. The Maid that night Reposed the first time on a perfumed pillow. She mused—how mournful seemed that youthful prince! How angel-like yet childlike that old monk! Ere long she saw in dream her parents' house Close by that ‘Fairy Tree’ beneath whose shade She oft had danced. A rose o'er-trailed that wall Painted with warlike deeds a century later. She trod its floor. The cottage inmates slept; The old mastiff guarding still in sleep that cradle Which had not held its babe for seventeen years. She sought the garden; hid in apple-bloom A bird half wakened chirped. She clomb a rock And eastward saw among the woody hills The upper waters of the silver Meuse Winding relaxed down from the dawn-touched Vosges. She saw; and sighed to wake. Three days passed by: The Council met at Poitiers. In the midst The Maid stood up. Briefly she told her tale. The Council next made question of her Faith: Her answers pleased it. Insight keen they shewed Humble albeit, and joined with lofty mind Strange soberness of heart. Great Truths to her, Thus spake those Elders whispering each to each, Shone through a diamond air: what others saw She touched with naked hand. They sent to Arc; Made inquest of her life. The peasants answered She was the lamb's best friend against the wolf: The answer of her parents was more brief:— ‘The child is good enough.’ Thus to the King The Council judgment sent: ‘That Maid is true: In her we find no ill but good alone, Faith, courage, love, pure life and upright heart. Your Grace instructs us that, untaught by men, She knew you, and that vow divulged to none. Next you demand, were these things miracles? Sir, miracles will glorify God's Church Till flames the last roof on the Judgment Day; But to distinguish miracles unquestioned From others fancy-feigned is hard. Your Grace Fitliest will act trusting at once this Maid And testing her. Let counsellors none approach her: Loose rein concede her. If her work be God's 'Twill tell its tale ere long.’ The King obeyed: Thus he addressed her: ‘Maid, thy suit is won: To Orleans lead ten thousand men—my best— Since there thou sayest that God will shew a sign.’ She answered: ‘Ere I march I claim three things: The first is this: the men who share that march Must be unhired; true men whose wage is God. My next demand is this: that standard old In the first Crusade the glory of old Tours: The world's Creator stands 'mid fleurs-de-lys Blazoned thereon—a gold sphere in His hand: That standard I must bear. My last demand— A sword there lies within Saint Catherine's Church At Fierbois: record of it none remains: Yet thrice in vision I have seen that sword: That sword must go before us on our march.’ The King complied. On the third night at twelve They found that sword she spake of; on its hilt That gravure she had seen. Swift as a blast Of hymns in rapture of thanksgiving borne O'er lands long parched when rain dissolves the drought, Rushed the great tidings. Edward the Black Prince And that fifth Henry, Crecy, and Agincourt Had done their work; and now an alien babe Lorded the realm. At last the shout had risen ‘Warriors and statesmen failed to shield our France: A Maid shall save her;’ and the land believed. While marched that Maid along the bank of Loire 'Mid pastures green new lit with fires of spring Thousands around her flocked. Round Orleans' walls The chiefest captains of that age were camped: Warnings she sent them. Mad with merriment They flung her missives on the winds: but some Who laughed not, whispered: ‘Brothers, bide the event! What God decrees shall come!’ On the third eve That Host triumphant eyed the foe they spurned; Ten thousand men fronted the setting sun Alone—the first—that standard in her hand, The Maid! Like men in dream they stood: ere long Divided. Through the lane thus formed she passed, She and her host unhired. No shout was heard: Like frozen men they stood. Vainly that hour Old warriors urged them on. The Maid and hers Through city-gates self-opening as might seem, Their summits thronged by starvelings pale and mute Rode to the minster; kneeling there gave thanks The in-rushing townsfolk sang aloud ‘Te Deum.’ In Orleans there was feast that night. Next day Their panic past that leaguering foe fought hard: Again the battle-cries of Salisbury rose Of Talbot and of Suffolk. In a week Again was silence. Six thousand lay in death beyond the walls: The remnant made retreat. Not unpursued— The Maid and her Ten Thousand followed fast. That mystic sword rapt from St. Catherine's Church Though borne before her in the battle's van She wielded never. In her sword-hand flamed The Oriflamme alone. Each battle won clothed her with light as when Miriam sole standing by the Red Sea raised Her cymbal, singing, ‘The Lord hath triumphed.’ Oft o'er the noble dead she wept; yet laughed To hear how Suffolk on the red grass lay Wounded, and how above him towered Renaud: ‘Art thou a knight?’ the old warrior made demand: Renaud replied, ‘Not yet.’ Then Suffolk laid On the young man's shoulder knighthood with his blade And said, ‘Your prisoner, Sir.’ She heard, and cried ‘Brave man and true! God grant him speedy ransom! All good men should be friends!’ There are who swear 'Twas not her faith alone which bore her on: By gift divine the science of the wars Was hers, infused; yet all confess alike Hers was besides some loftier inspiration. Later by thirty years thus Dunois witnessed: ‘Whate'er she wrought, or spake, or looked, in her A something supernatural still I noted. She seemed to live in God. The superstitions At which I laughed in peasant and in prince In her possessed no place. She spake not oft, And still her uttered words however great Seemed less than others which remained unuttered, Breed of the same high stock.’ Three months went by: Then to the King she sent. Her words were these: ‘Sleep'st thou, my King? Not thus thine ancestors! Sir, Heaven has done its part, and many a land Looks round amazed: and asks, “The King, where is he?” Sir, and my King, fulfilled is half my mission; Share with me the remainder. March to Rheims!’ The King obeyed. Girt by twelve thousand men She made that marvellous march — two hundred miles— Whereon each castled crag still frowned upon her Each city sent a host to bar her way. At last her mission's bourne, old holy Rheims, Shone from afar. Ere set of sun it sent Its best and noblest in procession long To greet the conqueror with the city's keys. That Conqueror was the Maid. The King it was Who thanked them with such grace, that all men cried, A Charlemagne restored! But verily No Charlemagne was he! Three days and more They venerated that city of Sanctuaries Where Clovis, earliest Christian king of France, With him three thousand thousand of his iron race, Led thither by his saintly wife, Clotilde, The young, the pure, the beautiful, the good, To Christ was joined in baptism. There, 'tis said, Saint Remi preached the Passion; there King Clovis Leaped to his feet and smote the altar steps Thrice with his sword, and cried, ‘Had I been there My Franks and I, that race accurst had perished!’ Upon Saint Osmond's Feast the King was crowned: The Mass completed, through the minster swelled Sound as of soft seas crushing sandy shores: Next with grave feet tuned as to strains in heaven Slowly advanced the prelate to the King: Beside that King, steel-clad from brow to foot And holding high the standard consecrate Stood up the Maid Elect. The mitred man Lodged in the monarch's grasp sceptre and globe, Chaunting that prayer ‘Stand firmly and hold fast.’ Thus was that second prophecy fulfilled:— ‘He shall be crowned at Rheims.’ The Maid Elect Sank on her knees. Thus spake she: ‘From my birth I hated those who stained our France with blood: No man henceforth I hate!’ She rose and spake: ‘Fair King, of kisses on thy hand impressed In pledge of fealty true the first be mine.’ She kissed his hand. Like homage paid by all Once more she spake. She spake with lifted hand That sceptreless appeared itself a sceptre: ‘Most gentle King, attend! Through help of God Orleans is free once more; the King is crowned. One duty yet remains. Within this church I leave this armour worn at God's command: My parents' home is near; to them I speed; I yearn to see them and my little sister, And tend once more our flock.’ A rapid glance The counsel-loving King around him cast, The award of all instinctively descried (Unkingly faculty, and yet his chiefest). He spake: ‘The coronation feast attends; We'll treat of this to-morrow.’ As he spake On the Maid's brow fell shade till then unseen. Next morning, ere that weariness and chill Which follows fierce excitements had dispersed The weight of many a war-field on her still, Dunois approached the Maid. ‘The war without you,’ He said, ‘will turn to wreck.’—From the sweet lip Came answer sad. ‘Dunois! It may not be! Orleans is free: the King is crowned at Rheims: These were my Mission: nought was given beside: A year ends all.’ A bishop rose: ‘A year? How many a crime a year of war brings forth! Maid, to thy prince thy duty is fulfilled; Fight next for France! For this a month suffices.’ Others their supplications joined with his— An hour went by and more— The King made entrance. ‘Let the damsel be! She warned me early—“All shall kiss thy hand; In pledge of fealty true: the first be mine.” The first that tendered pledge forsakes me first; Many will leave me soon.’ Pallid she sat More than her wont, the rest around her standing: Then first, then last, she parleyed with a Doubt. With lips compressed at last she made reply: ‘Be it. This second task may meet from God Acceptance, yet is not of God's command.’ A trivial sin save that in Souls so great No sin is trivial—claims a trivial penance: An Error:—yet it gave the Maid her crown! A feastful week the King abode at Rheims With tournament and dance where brightest eyes Flashed brighter. Round the monarch nobles flocked Ice-cold till then. Lorraine's old duke, and Bar, Damoiseau de Commercy; knights uncounted. King Charles, long pleasure-fooled, fought well when tested. Leon and Soisson, Provins, Chateau-Treve, Willing or forced, submitted: later on Beauvais right gladly, Sens, and St. Denis. Bedford's great duke, left regent by King Henry, At Paris crowned his babe. Vainly with all Consummate soldiership could work, all craft Of march and countermarch by him alone Possessed, that regent kept at bay his fate Till Beaufort joined him with five thousand men. Charles triumphed; yet the war had suffered change: Less music in the camp was heard, less prayer. The men who first to Orleans marched unhired, Now sweated in their farms. Its inspiration Had died from off the countenance of the war, Failed from its inmost heart. Strategic skill Supplied its place but scantly. Jealousies Crept forth. To stifle such the Maid renounced Sole and supreme command. The Battle's van Thenceforward was her place. One night a dream She dreamed—ah, how unlike that Chinon dream!— The war was past; to Arc she walked alone, Less buoyant was her footstep than of old; Heavy with August sunshine spread the boughs; The harvest slopes were golden. Near arrived, Her heart already in her childhood's home, She clomb a rock which over-gazed the village. Back she recoiled. There endless winter reigned! Deep snow hid all. The Maid—so ran her dream— Thought thus—or heard it from a stranger near ‘The Penance this of some poor soul that sinned.’ Rushed from that rock, pushed knee-deep through that snow: She found her parents' hut half fallen. One hearth Remained, a cradle near, a mastiff dead— It had not stiffened yet. Next day she led A sally from Compiègne then leaguered long: A storm burst forth and lightning smote the earth. Blinded she seemed at first then gazed around. A panic seized her followers, and they fled. She scorned to fly; an arrow pierced her horse. He fell; the battle tempest o'er her rolled. Some sware 'twas treason's work. To the end—since shames There are, such shames 'tis shameful to record them. By laws of war that Maid, her ransom paid, Had walked in freedom. Traitors, that law well knowing Flung soon around their prey the hunter's net. Beauvais' false prelate from his see expelled By popular suffrage for conspiracy With Bedford—Bedford's creature since that day, Devised that plot,—they tried the Maid for crimes Unknown to courts of war—not civil treason But sorcery, magic, and such spiritual sins As meet their doom in spiritual courts alone. In Rouen sat that court, Beauvais its head; Beside him fifty doctors, casuists, lawyers, With others. Cardinal Beaufort was of these, That prince world-famous for his terrible end Who saw the murdered Gloster's spectre near And cried, ‘Comb down his hair! It stands upright, Like limed twigs set to catch my winged soul!’ Shakespeare, King Henry VI. Part II. Act iii. Scene 3. Then passed to judgment. Midmost in that court The Maid stood daily, friendless, unalarmed; A wild-eyed throng around her raged for joy As late with fear; since all that Norman realm Sworn to Duke William's offspring hated France, Her most, the Maid, yet half believed her mission. Unmoved she stood; at times she smiled; at times Her dark eye rested with a sadness sweet On brows, some mitred, yet unvenerable, And wrinkled scribes with hot and hurrying hand Transmuting Truth to lies. Question on question They hurled at her in mass. ‘Fair sirs,’ she said Like one by children's petulance half-amused ‘I pray you put your questions one by one Not thus at random.’ Some one called her ‘Joan’; She answered, ‘Gentle lord, men call me “Maid”; That name I answer best.’ ‘Are you in grace?’ She answered, ‘If I be, God keep me in it; Better to die than live not loving God.’ Questions doctrinal next they put to snare her. First gravely, then with sternness she replied, ‘Fair sirs, be wise in questioning! Themes there are On which I answer not and should not answer. My gentle lords, ye call yourselves my judges: Ye are such; therefore judge with judgment just. This is your trial day!’ That eve at dusk, Folk issuing slowly from the Judgment Hall, Thus Beaufort spake to Beauvais: ‘Yonder girl May be impostor; she's no Visionary. Her words though strange have pith; and when she walks Though light her tread her foot takes hold o' the ground.’ Beauvais made answer low: ‘Lord Cardinal A King's son you and walk the world unquestioned; There's not one street in Rouen I could tread If I released that Maid!’ The Cardinal next With thin lip curled, ‘The better for Barabbas!’ Abortive thus nine days the judges met. No witnesses were called or none made answer. They baited her; 'twas vain. Not once she shewed Distempered mind. It was not thus with them: Writhing in wrath at last they shouted thus: ‘Full adjuration or the death by fire!’ She answered: ‘Sirs, deceive not your own hearts: Sirs, it was God Who sent me. I appeal To God, the Pope, and all the Church of Christ.’ The judges whispered; next advanced a clerk; That clerk read low an act of abjuration Suppressing half that act. She waived it back. He read her next a brief unmeaning scroll; It pledged her but to ride thenceforth no more In war a knight steel-clad. Smiling she took it; Glanced at it lightly; signed it with a cross; That cross they placed upon a parchment new, An abjuration full. The lie thus forged Lived, a tradition long. The murder craft Ended not there. Next morning she awoke Roused by a sun-flash from her knightly mail In malice filched from her when captured first, In malice worse restored. With beating heart She gazed upon those arms. She mused: ‘I feared At first to wear them though at God's command. How soon that maiden fear was changed to joy At Orleans late delivered, then at Rheims Rheims where I longed to leave them—that is past! Armour no more I wear in war for ever. What then? My task is wrought, my King is King! This chance reveals to me my last high duty:— I wear them one hour more.’ Steel panoplied She sang her last ‘Te Deum.’ It was heard By angel ears. Not theirs alone—‘Relapsed!’ The spies rushed forward crying: ‘Renegade false Who swore'st to bear no arms!’ Upon their leader She fixed her gaze. ‘Bishop, by you I die: Last eve you veiled your plot; you now divulge it! Your charge is false. I swore last eve to bear Thenceforth no arms in war: I keep that oath. I swore those Voices were authentic Voices The Voices of God's Saints. That oath is true; I disobeyed those Voices once alone, Sore tempted then. That sin they have forgiven; Not two months since they promised me deliverance How that may come I know not. Be it so: Not seeing, I believe. “Relapsed.” That word bears meaning—“Death by fire!” Farewell, my lord!’ The man dismissed retired Incensed yet glad to go. That morn by one, A beauteous English boy—her sword had saved him In battle's fiercest, and he loved her well— She sent a message to old Baudricourt, A message, for she ne'er had learned to write: ‘Farewell, true friend! That eve we spake together You thus addressed me: “God has given you Faith: Pray God it walk beside you all your life, Sustain you at your death!” At that word “death” a tear was in your eye; I marked it, and I should have thanked you for it. I thank you for it now.’ To those her dearest Her words were few:—‘God's work is worked, thank God! O what a meeting will be ours in heaven! Till then rejoice! O father! and O mother! O sister mine, farewell!’ In the market-place That synod of the unholy met once more. Beauvais and Beaufort shouldered through the crowds: (Men honour least the priest that courts their suffrage). The Cardinal spake: ‘Bishop, those varlets flout you! Look well before you! When you've burned yon Maid, The noblest spirit this land has ever bred, Be sure you drown her ashes in the Seine! They'll quicken else more late to fiery snakes And sting your France to death!— I joined your hunting-match for England's sake Remembering those two lands were ever foes:— With you compared I seem but half a villain.’ They reached the court; the twain together sat. A summary of the trial duly read, Beauvais kept silence long. A Norman cried, ‘No friend art thou to Henry's babe late crowned If thou release that Traitress!’ Beauvais rose: With fear in haught demeanour veiled he spake: ‘This day at dawn I saw her in her cell; She watched the hour; she waited some deliverance; Those Voices she revered were pledged to one. Scorning her sacred vow of yestereve The sorceress stood steel-mailed!’ Again he sat: In thunder roared the hall. Death-pale he rose: ‘Relapsed! All know the sentence—Death by fire.’ At morn the Maid, her last confession ended, Christ's Body had received. Unmoved she stood, Unmoved as Mary by the Saviour's cross: Unmoved she heard the preacher's funeral sermon. Full sorely he descanted on her crimes, Next on the King's. That second censure moved her. High as she might she raised her arm —'twas chained— She spake: ‘I pray you, sir,’ gainst me alone Launch your rebuke, the King is no offender. The King he is of France; her Christian King.’ Again she spake: ‘I pray for those who slay me, I pray for Charles the rightful King of France, For God's good pardon, and for grace to pass Gladly to Him; not caitiff-like, nor coward.’ That moment from the pyre the flames burst up: Then first the Maid wox white and trembled sorely; And from the crowd a soldier stept, and brake A slender staff in twain and made a cross And placed it in her hand. She kissed that cross And pressed it to her heart. In agony She wept, ‘O any death save death by fire!’ Noting that many wept—there are who say That Beauvais' self was of them—shivering she cried ‘Pray for me all ye Christian people, pray!’ Then fell from God a wonder. At her word That multitude, late raging, knelt on the earth And prayed for her who could no longer pray; And o'er the Maid there came an answering change: Raptured she raised her hands; a splendour fell Full on her face; she seemed to grow in stature; A wingèd Spirit she looked nor Maid, nor Woman. Then first she heard the Bridal Song of Heaven; Heard last those Voices heard so oft of old: ‘We promised thee deliverance in two months; This thy deliverance is, and this we promised— Deliverance to thy God.’ The flames rose high; A sweet and sudden gust blew them towards her: Aloud she cried, ‘He makes His angels flames! Cleanse me, my God! My Voices were true voices; true my Mission! All praise to Him Who sent it! Jesus! Jesus!’ Forward she bent her to that flame, and died. Then horror fell on all; and from those seats In circle reared where still the judges sat That hour by thickening smoke-clouds veiled from man Rang forth a piercing, solitary cry; ‘All lost! We've slain a Saint! She reigns in Heaven! Who wrought that sin, on them the doom shall fall.’ And wild through Rouen's streets till set of sun Thousands there ran with hands high tossed, and cried, ‘We've slain a Saint! On us the doom shall fall!’ But all the heart of France from north to south Like Alpine floods in spring, rushed to the Maid Till, through her praise on earth and prayer on high, King Charles—her King—reigned o'er his rightful realm. We know not if he laboured to protect her: It may be Agnes Sorel willed it not: Likelier he sent to her some message gentle: Being, e'er a King, a courteous Prince and kind. Her kinsfolk he ennobled, and their name Changed to ‘De Lys’; for thus he said, ‘That Maid Was more than maid—the Lily sole of France.’ Likewise a later Pope reversed the sentence By schismatics and traitors passed that day. THE HIGHER PURGATORY. The primary thoughts embodied in this poem are taken from the celebrated treatise on Purgatory by St. Catherine of Genoa. Two of them will be recognized by those acquainted with Cardinal Newman's magnificent poem, ‘The Dream of Gerontius,’ pp. 330 and 336, edition of 1868. Both are in entire accordance with the teaching of that treatise. In Genoa by the sea Saint Catherine sang and thus, while o'er the wave Glittered the star of eve. Whence came her lore? Not from scholastic parchments, texts obscure, But creeds of Holy Church felt in their depths, And from that reflex cast on saintly minds Down from the mirror of the Mind Supreme When God sends gifts to man. What land is that— That Land majestic, mystic, wondrous, blest, Yet heart-subduing too, and soul-o'erawing Where passion riots not, where love earth-soiled Divinely blighted, withering to the root, Leaves room for heavenly love? What Land is that Where earthly mists obscure not Truths eterne, Thenceforth but seen like ghosts of fair shapes dead Or Souls in limbo pent? What Land is that Whose piercing airs from God's own mountain launched Cancel disease, reclothes the leper's bones As though with infant's flesh; takes from our nature Its downward leaning, girds it as with wings Of heavenward aspiration? 'Tis not earth! Before earth's sons have reached that hallowed site Her probatory state is past for ever. They that fought bravely from their labours rest And bathe in healing wells. The songs of heaven Reach them: the All-Blessèd Vision is not theirs— It will be theirs! That thirst for God unsated Which from the human bars the inferior kinds, Chief prophecy of man's predestined greatness, Survives, their sorrow sole. If lesser griefs Be theirs, they heed not such. What clime is that Still as the Church's Holy Saturday Sabbath twice hallowed of God's New Creation His second, by endurance wrought not act— That Saturday when now the Week of Woes Behind us lies, Christ's obsequies complete— That Sabbath both of rest and expectation When now once more the lights are lit, the Cross Unveiled, the ‘Gloria in Excelsis’ sung, When sleeps the Saviour in the tomb close sealed, When they who love Him share His sacred rest Low bent and listening while the vesper psalms Now rise, now sink, like waves that hide, then shew Some ever-setting sun? Deepest that rest Man knows on earth; yet deeper theirs the Souls That breathe that cleansing clime. They sinned on earth; They sin no more. In them that buried sin From circumstance of time and place sequestered Sleeps like a sheathèd sword. Their Will with God's At last—now first—is one. Such Unity Alone could breed such rest. What Grief is that Which, teaching man his primal greatness, shames His joy foregone in pleasures wed to dust? Such joy man knew not first. The Sire of men 'Mid flowers of Eden walked without a smile: The gladness of all kinds that round him ranged Seemed though a beauteous yet an alien thing. God saw, and gave that man for mate an equal Made in God's image. That was Love's first grade. Later, God walked Himself upon the earth, The God-Man, the Redeemer, Lord and Friend. Thenceforth man's love attained its second grade; Thenceforth, all love, if bound to earth alone, Madness had seemed, not love. Life veils Love's greatness: Life veils not less the greatness of high Grief: We are but trivial lovers all our life— We are but trivial mourners. Thanks to God, Who grants us at life's close one sovereign Love, One Grief, the cure for all. See and discern! ‘I said that ye are Gods.’ Through sin alone Was added: ‘Ye shall die as beasts that perish.’ Each Soul at its creation is all pure; Forth as it issues from beneath God's Hand, (If Poets thus may speak in parable, Not wronging Truth dim-seen in Fancy's glass.) A flash comes o'er it, as from God's own Face; Comes, and is gone! The Soul, in Body bound, Sees it no more. That moment did its work: That moment launched abroad o'er every Soul Like flight of wild swans o'er a dark lake's mirror Those spirit-cravings which are Spirit's self, Those wing'd Ideas which are Reason's essence, Conscience's inspiration. What are these? The great Ideas of the Good, the True, The Fair, the Pure, the Just, the Infinite,— These are the irradiation of man's being; These light with hope the cradles and the graves: Where'er there's greatness here on earth, its source Was that brief flash! That was not ‘Blessed Vision,’ A Gift reserved. Christ's Heritage in Souls It was; to sinful Adam's dread Bequest The counter hope sublime. That primal Beam Made Truth Revealed believable through Faith To Man, though fallen. It hurled God's warrior forth To battle with the monsters of man's life; Gave souls their ‘Militant State,’ and—victory won— Their thrones upon God's throne! One other moment Like that there is—but one! 'Tis when the Soul, Its Militant State surceased, stands up, death past, Ah pure no more, before Christ's judgment seat. Christ's Countenance that hour—for infinite That hour the depths of its compassionateness— Reveals the award—a pardon and a penance: The past is judged and dies; the Soul, self-seeing, Through no compulsion, sadly yet in hope, Flees to the cleansing realm. There Suffering nigh Greater than Action seals its holy work Since there God acts alone. That suffering Soul Rejoices in its pain. Had choice been given To leave that realm, its healing incomplete, Before high Justice had its uttermost farthing, Before God's Will was utterly fulfilled, That Soul had cried, ‘Not so!’ Two moments these:— The earliest stamps on man his Maker's image, The last renews that image dimmed by sin. Makes penance sorrow's balm. What means that penance? A Sorrow nobler than earth's noblest Joy!— Sorrow of Souls supremely loving God That see not God. On earth we see the earth; In Heaven the Saints see God. In Purgatory The Souls behold Him not. Near them He is— Nearer than here on earth were soul and body: Such nearness unto souls that see not God Is sorrow—sorrow's sharpest. Could a mother Hearing for years the small feet of her child Pattering along some upper chamber's floor Content her with the sound?—a child rejoice Who, seeing all others, saw no more her mother Yet heard her voice well known? The Sophist asks How with such suffering solace can consist? The Master answers: Who are blest on earth? The great, the rich, the strong? Not such, but those Who, stormed against by Fortune and by Fate, Racked by disease, worn out by long frustrations, Not less can hear Christ's whisper in their hearts, ‘Blessed the mourners.’ That Beatitude Sits throned in Purgatory. ‘O felix culpa!’ 'Tis not our Earth. 'Tis not a second Eden, Not endless spring and never-fading flowers; Not gambols of those playmates lion and lamb;— Not these; but earth redeemed and promised heaven Man's Vision of his God. Without that Vision The heaven of heavens were but a vulgar joy Needing perchance no previous Purgatory. The discipline of earthly pain suffices To unfilm pure eyes to mysteries of Grace Withheld from worldly sight. Austerer pain Unfilms them to the mysteries of Glory; No servile pain, not selfish; greater pain Born of a greater love. Thus taught, man learns That lesson all too high for Souls flesh-bound, The creature was not for the creature made But for the sole Creator; for that cause Longs for his Maker as the blind for light, Pants for Him as the hart for water-springs, Rushes to God as rivers to the sea Life's hindrance once removed. Hail, holy Death! We glimpse God's light through crevices and chinks, Till thy strong mace shatters our earthly prison; Then from the dead face dawns that smile of death Which mutely thanks its God! Hail, Holy Souls! Calm as that smile are ye, as mute, as bright! Ye know that God is near. That sacred presence Grows stronger than your consciousness of self: Self, weakening, murmurs but ‘Thy will be done,’ Dying, is glad to die. O precious pains How unlike pains of earth!—ambitions wrecked Suspicions, fears, remorse without repentance. O pains, how unlike those of reprobate Spirits! Who, bound by fiat of a will all hate, To proffered grace extend a hand clasped hard In death and after death! The Holy Souls Fast rooted in God's love hate sin alone: Sin's chain is burst; sin's stain awhile remains. Not life with all its medicinal woes, Nor Death that o'er the dying rolls at once Lethe and Eunoe, See Dante's Purgatorio, canto xxxiii. could cleanse that stain. But more than life or death is God's Compassion: It shaped for man—perhaps ere yet that fruit Fatal was plucked—a sphere purer than earth Whose fire is fire of light. O Spirits blind! Who see in Purgatory no Paradise, Why gaze but on that planet's shadowy side! Its bright side sees the sun! Hail, saintly realm! Those seeds of greatness in the human soul Sown when, created first, it saw God's Face, Re-sown when it beheld its great Redeemer's, Mature themselves in your inspiring clime, Energies, instincts, spiritual faculties Proportioned to that spiritual universe Man's destined heritage, and greater far Than all God's visible worlds—‘My portion Thou.’ O noble, travailing Soul! that generatest A greater Soul, and heavenlier than thyself,— A greater, yet in part the same—rejoice! The worm one day shall soar! All praise to Him Who made the Militant State, so brave, so fair; It takes us far upon the heavenward road: All praise to Him Who made the Suffering State; It lays us down before the gate of Heaven. The first waged war on things external half, The last on that interior foe—Self-Love, Specious Self-Love, that ‘subtlest beast of the field,’ That Serpent old which round man's inmost being Winds itself, fold on fold. A touch all fire Unrings it: to its victim's feet it falls. Self-love extinct, true Love stands up delivered: The two Commandments crowned resume their sway The second in sublime subordination: Man's eyes are opened; man beholds his God. O sons of earth, if this be Purgatory, What thing is Heaven itself? HYMNS FROM ST. GERTRUDE. O God, my God! a slender voice from earth Were weak to sing Thee. May Thy fair, strong Sons, Thronging through heaven, Thine Angels and Thy Saints The Hierarchies of Thy Predestinate, In triumph hymn Thee: may their song be mine! Those Spirits Seven that stand before Thy throne, And they the fervid hosts Thou sendest forth Like light o'er all the earth to minister Thy gifts and graces to the Race Redeemed, Let them sing loud and let their song be mine. The Four and Twenty Elders that adore Thee; The Patriarchs, and the Prophets, they that cast Their crowns for ever down before Thy throne; The Living Creatures Four shadowed with wings That from Thy praises cease not day or night, Let them sing loud and let their song be mine. That worshipful and Apostolic Band High Puissances of Love, that with the might Of their wide arms in intercession raised Sustain—for such Thy Will—Thy sacred Church That crests with towers the many-mountained earth While the vain storm of ages round it roars, Let them sing loud and let their song be mine. The armies of Thy Martyrs, they whose robes Are purple ever with Thy Blood, not theirs, Which makes, through them, all Earth a Calvary, Let them sing loud and let their song be mine. The shining Senate of Thy Confessors In blest translation from this world of sin Lifted by Thee henceforth Thy peace to share And reign with Thee in ever waning light, Let them sing loud and let their song be mine. Thy Virgin Choir serenely clothed upon With the snows of incorruption, they whose brows Flash far the splendours of Thy Sanctity; Who, up the hills of God ascending ever, Where'er He goeth follow still the Lamb, From their glad hearts resounding that new Song ‘Jesus, Thou Spouse of Virgin souls, all hail!’ Let them sing loud and let their song be mine. May Thine Elect, whom none can know or number Thy people from all nations give Thee praise; Thou art their God and there is none beside: May all Thy marvellous works in Heaven and Earth That jubilee re-echo: may Thy Church And she, that World material, sisters twain, Sustain the eternal psalm antiphonal Burn in one joy, and send Thee back a gleam Reflex of that high glory increate Whereof both flood and torrent fount art Thou. HYMN OF PRAISE TO GOD. (THOUGHTS FROM ST. GERTRUDE.) Height inaccessible of Sovran Power; Unfathomed depth of Wisdom hid and sealed; Limitless breadth of all-embracing Love; None but Thyself can yield Thee worthy praise: Thyself alone canst know Thyself. Our Hymns Are as a little breeze that dies. O then May Thine eternal Godhead yield Thee praise: Thy Majesty enthroned and measureless May It upon the altar of Itself Offer the unceasing incense. May the expanse Of Thy far Wisdom round Creation's shores Murmur Thy praise. Thy Justice and Thy Might And all Thine Attributes unknown or known Like heavenly armies may they chaunt Thy Name, They most Thy piercing Sweetness and the voice Wounding, yet healing, of Thy tender Love! May all the Names that name Thee, may the might Of all Thy Titles radiant o'er the gates Of that Jerusalem Thy regal seat, Which are as banners blazoning Thee to man; May those mute Types, revealed or latent yet In the depths of thought, which like to keys unlock The secret chambers of Thy Mysteries, Bless Thee for ever, give Thee thanks for me, Exult in Thee, adore Thee, chaunt the praise Of each of Thy Compassions in old time Vouchsafed, or now, or in the years to come, Vouchsafed to me Thy least, or him the greatest Whoe'er he be, of all Thy heavenly Hosts. May the adored Humanity of Christ Praise Thee, my God, for me. May every Act And Suffering of His Converse here on earth Yield Thee a separate incense. Be they thine His divine Virtue and the all-wondrous Grace That passed miraculous from Him. May His tears And those Five Fountains of His Blood all pure, Drown my transgressions; may His precious Death My lack supply and glorify Thy Name. May that serenest Queen and crowned Creature That in the full assembly of Thy Saints Through her humility is highest throned And nearest to her Son, Mary thrice-blest, May she, O Thou Creator of all worlds, For me extol Thee; may the heavenly choirs Ten thousand times ten thousand, blissful Souls, And singing Spirits, hymn Thee. Not alone Standeth the great Priest in the light eterne: His own are with Him; what He doth they do; And as the Shadow with the Substance moves They also lift their hands and chaunt Thy praise. May our most holy Mother in all lands The Universal Church exult in Thee, Praise Thee for me, and sing to Thee. May they Her Daughters Seven, the all-quickening Sacraments, Her dread yet gentle Rites with touch air-soft, Her reverend and decorous Ceremonies, Her Penances, her Vigils, and her prayers, Her Psalms re-echoed far from peak or isle Or Minster city-girt, while reigns the sun At noon, or sink the stars beneath the sea; May all her Sanctities and holy Woes Praise Thee, and all her Raptures, their reward, The still processions of her kingly Thoughts, The angel-like ascent of Hopes and Vows, Her sacred Longings, her divine Desires, And each low sigh breathed from this vale of tears. May all Thy gifts of Grace on me bestowed Though I be dumb, confess Thee. May that Love Which from Eternity its pitying eyes Reposed on me a spot amid the void And forth from darkness called me; may the hands Of that strong Providence which shaped my way Praise Thee. May all my being, all I have Or am, self-known, or self-unknown, to Thee Well known, my Maker, sing Thy laud. May all My Faculties of Body, Mind, and Soul, My nerves and veins, my sinews and my bones, With Thee through labours or high suffering knit, Praise Thee; they too, my Memory and my Will, My Heart with all its groanings, and my Life Warring to death on Sin which is Thy foe. HYMN ON THE DIVINE HUMANITY OF CHRIST. (THOUGHTS FROM ST. GERTRUDE.) Jesus, Thou Son of God, true God, true Man! May one voice more, a feeble voice from earth, Blend with the choirs that Mystery who sing Highest, that thrilling Influx unrevealed Of Thy Divinity, which, like a tide From ocean winding up an inland stream, Creeps on through Thy Humanity for aye; Creeps on through that Humanity enthroned In heaven, transfigured 'mid the eternal light, High guerdon for the Wounds that yet It bears Deep-graved; the Wounds that wrought man's peace below. Jesus, Thou Son of God, true God, true Man! A voice from earth would join the choirs that sing That breathless, ravishing, supreme delight, Springtide of bloom for aye renewed, wherein The sacred Eyes of Thy Humanity, That close not, in their venerable trance Feast on that golden pasture limitless; The Vision of the Eternal Three in One. Jesus, Thou Son of God, true God, true Man! A voice from earth would join the choirs that sing That quietude and solace high wherein The sacred Ears of Thy Humanity, Fruition evermore renewed, are held Not by the lute or viol wind or cord But by those dread interior Harmonies For ever whispering round the abyss of God, Prime Hymeneal and perpetual psalm— The Concords of the Eternal Three in One. Jesus, Thou Son of God, true God, true Man! A voice from earth would join the choirs that sing The sweet refreshment of Thy heavenly Rest; That clear, sabbatical, and mystic clime Whereby Thy deified Humanity, Its suffering past, is equably embraced, The embowering sunset of its endless peace, And that vivific fragrance evermore Breathed from that underlying Eden vast The Bosom of the Eternal Trinity. Jesus, Thou Son of God, true God, true Man! Humanity with Godhead crowned, all hail; In Thy Sufficiencies impassable; With spiritual senses clothed; to earthly pain Superior, or the attempt of earthly joys! In place of these one kingly bliss is Thine, Simple, inviolate, indivisible, The inflowing of Divinity for aye Permeant through Thy Humanity as when All heaven distils itself through dewy woods. Hail, Son of God, and Mary's Child! Through Thee Within her luminous Bridal Chamber still Humanity with God for ever holds Commerce transcendent. Hail, for ever hail, Christ, God and Man, that makest all things one! THE TRUE HUMANITY. (FROM ST. GERTRUDE.) Sacred Humanity of Christ, all hail! Glorified Manhood Who alone art Man; Great Archetype in God's own image formed From everlasting. Adam was to Thee Second, not first. Essential Man art Thou; We are but pigmy and distorted shades Down cast from Adam's lightning-blasted trunk Upon the blighted heath of mortal life, Or timeless and abortive fruit unblest Cumbering his boughs. True God, alone true Man! Thou from Whose touch deific streams that power Which keeps from further and more bestial lapse The race created Human; hail, O hail! Hail in Thy Paradise of lonely light Walking with God; in Thy Regalities The Mediatorial Realm from pole to pole Swaying: all hail, great Pontiff, with Thyself Lighting Thy Church: all hail, Prophetic Power God's Wisdom prime, His Uncreated Word, Before Whose eyes Creation yet unborn In vision passed; and from Whose tongue her Works Their Names received, and were what they were called. COLUMBUS AND THE SEA-PORTENT. Fiercelier eight days the tempest roared and raved: Feeblier each day that God-protected bark Shuddering in every plank, and panting, clomb The mountain waves or sank to vales betwixt them: Meantime the great Sea-Wanderer lay nigh death In agonies unnamed: old wounds once more Bled fast at every joint. At times his head He raised to learn if stood the masts or fell; Then on his pallet sank with hands hard clasped, Silent. Full oft the mariners o'erspent Approached him clamouring ‘Master, give it o'er! Drift we before the storm to loved Castile!’ Such suppliants still Columbus answered thus In words unchanged: ‘Good news were that for Powers Accursed, who clutch dominion long usurped Lording God's Western world! They hate the Cross And know that when it lands their realm dissolves. Theirs is this tempest; and therein they ride!’ The eighth eve had come. While hard the sunset strove To pierce the on-racing clouds, a cry rang out Re-echoed from those caravels three hard by,— The cry of men death-doomed. Columbus rose: Saint Francis' habit and Saint Francis' cord Girt him, for on the seas—at times on land— His great heart joyed to wear that Patriarch's garb Within whose sacred convent-homes full oft When sick he lay with earthly hope deferred, Hope heavenly rose renewed. The Kings had mocked, The monks sustained him. Hail, Rabida, hail! Thy cloisters he had paced; thy pathways hard Yet sweet with lavender and thyme; had gazed On the azure waves from Palos' promontory; Listened its meek Superior's words: ‘Fear nought! Beyond that beaming ocean lies thy world! Thou seek'st that world for God's sake, not for man's; Therefore God grants it thee.’ Next morn he sailed: That holy monk his great Viaticum Gave him while yet 'twas dark. He heard that cry:— Like warrior-Pontiff or like Prophet old Treading the leanest of grey Carmel's crags Such seemed he, steadying with drawn sword his steps. The sailors round him crouched. Whence came their terror? That Spectre Demon of ‘The gloomy sea’ Till then by Europe's mariners never kenned Was circling t'ward them. Evermore in gyres Nearer it reeled departing to return. They who in later years beheld that shape Gave it this name, ‘The Typhon of the waves’ Sole name that yet it bears on eastern seas. Tower-like its columned stem ascends up-drawing To heaven huge ocean wastes, a tree of death Whose crest far-spread blackens the waves like night: The spell dissolves; it breaks; it falls. The ship Beneath—whole navies were they linked in one— Thenceforth are seen no more. Columbus stood: Alone of those who gazed he felt no fear: Like Lucifer ere fallen that Portent flashed; Like Lucifer, a rebel judged, it gloomed: Calmly the Man of God gazed on. He knew That Spirits of bale and Nature's Powers alike Bow to God's Will. The man but late had read The Gospel of St. John. He raised the tome: His sword pressed down the page. He read, not loud— And yet with voice that pierced that raging storm: ‘In the beginning was the Word; with God For evermore He dwelt: He made the worlds. And lo! the Word of God assumed Man's Flesh.’ He ceased; anon he spake: ‘Whate'er thou art, Or Spirit or Body or both, hear and obey! My Christ is God: He wears Man's Flesh in heaven: We sail to plant Christ's Cross on Pagan shores: By this, His Sign, I bid thee hence! Depart!’ Then with his sword the Christian Sign he signed High in the air; and on the deck beneath Slowly a circle traced. Again he spake: ‘As stand the Hills around Jerusalem So round His People stands the Lord their God; The kingdom of the Impure is cut in twain!’ And straight the advancing Portent, thus adjured, Swerved from his course and curving t'ward the North, Vanished in cloud. Once more a cry was heard— Cry of those Spirits dethroned In distance lost It died. Then slowly from the North on rolled The gathered bulk of ocean in one wave An onward-moving mountain smooth as huge, And lifted by that wave, lifted not whelmed, Those worn-out mariners saw again that sun A long hour set. Sobbing the tempest ceased: Prone lay the ocean like that sea of glass Mingled with fire that spreads before God's throne: The glory of the Lord was on that wave. And some there were that westward saw the coast. Painless that night the Apostolic Man Slumbered; upon his breast that scroll of him Whose head had rested on the Master's breast. All night fair visions soothed him; western Isles Innumerable, thick-set with temples vast That hurled their worship to the God Triune; And, eastward far, his boyhood's hope fulfilled, Christ's Sepulchre redeemed from Moslem thrall; Pale Christians from their dungeons issuing free; And Christian standards crowning Salem's towers. COLUMBUS AT SEVILLE. A number of charges have recently been made against Columbus which are strikingly at variance with a crowd of high authorities, charges that represent him as little better than a selfish adventurer, if not a brutal buccaneer. Such an estimate would cheat the world of the reverence which it has been hitherto privileged to feel for one of its greatest men. Those who wrote at more leisure on the subject will not, however, be very easily put out of court. Washington Irving speaks thus: ‘The system of Columbus (he refers to the Ripartimentos) may have borne hard upon the Indians, born and brought up in untasked freedom, but it was never cruel or sanguinary. He (Columbus) inflicted no wanton massacres, nor vindictive punishments; his desire was to cherish and civilize the Indians, and to render them useful subjects, not to oppress and persecute and destroy them. When he beheld the desolation that had swept them from Maryland during his suspension from authority, he could not suppress the strong expression of his feelings. In a letter written to the king after his return to Spain he thus expresses himself on the subject: “The Indians of Hispaniola were and are the riches of the island: for it is they who cultivate, and make the bread and the provisions for the Christians, who dig the gold from the mines, and perform all the offices and labours both of men and beasts. I am informed that since I left this island six parts out of seven of the natives are dead, all through ill treatment and inhumanity.” They had,’ Irving tells us, ‘loved him well, and wept at his departure.’ Irving also insists on it that zealous as Columbus was for the advancement of scientific knowledge, ‘still he regarded it (the discovery of America) but as a minor event preparatory to the great enterprise,’ the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. ‘The spirit of the Crusades had not passed away.’ Sir Arthur Helps writes: ‘Columbus had all the spirit of a Crusader, and, at the same time, the investigating nature of a modern man of science. It is thus that Prescott speaks of Columbus: ‘The finger of the historian will find it difficult to point to a single blemish in his moral character. His correspondence breathes the sentiment of devoted loyalty to his sovereigns. His conduct habitually displayed the utmost solicitude for the interests of his followers. ... His dealings were regulated by the nicest principles of honour and justice.... The grand object to which he devoted himself seemed to expand his whole soul.... It (Columbus' character) was in perfect harmony with the grandeur of his plans, and their results more stupendous than those which heaven has permitted any other mortal to achieve.’—Ferdinand and Isabella, Part II. chap. ix. A vindictive and unworthy habit of brooding over his own wrongs has been by some attributed to Columbus, on the ground that he ordered that the chains placed upon him when he was sent home to Spain a disgraced man should be buried with him. But a letter written by him in his later life, and published long since, distinctly states that his aim in issuing that command, or at least in sustaining it, was that the memory of his wrongs should be interred with him. He feared lest those chains might excite in their beholders feelings of a vindictive character and one injurious to the king and queen. Had the act of Columbus not been one of a distinctly generous character there need still have been nothing vindictive about it. Another charge brought against Columbus is that he urged the Spanish Government to send the Spanish criminals to the Indies. Had this counsel meant that those criminals were ever to mix with the general population of the Indies it would have been a grievous error, though one which in very recent times has disgraced colonization. As Washington Irving states it, the counsel more probably was only that Spanish criminals should expiate their crimes, so long as their sentences lasted, upon public works in the Indies not in Spain, thus protecting the Indian population from the heaviest toils and supplying labour for arduous works absolutely necessary in the new Spanish settlements. It can hardly be supposed that Columbus, who, though a wonderful Christian hero, was a man and not an angel, never fell into any error or inconsistency in the course of his long and stormy career. We do not know how truly great and good a man is unless we know both how seldom he errs seriously, and how seriously he laments such errors. Perhaps this consideration weighed with me when representing Columbus as, on a single occasion and under most trying circumstances, adopting a course which seemed at the time to him right and necessary, but which at a later time he condemned. Whether his earlier judgment or his later was sound we cannot now know. It need not be observed that no severity of self-condemnation could in him be a measure of its justice, since great natures often lament imaginary defects, and exaggerate every deviation from their high abiding aim, while meaner natures deny or extenuate their errors. If Columbus erred on that one occasion his greatness can well afford the admission of that error by his most ardent admirers. But the act in question was one which we cannot now judge; for Columbus was surrounded by traitors bent on his destruction, who falsified his deeds in order to cover their own crimes, and who may well have tampered with his correspondence no less. In the life of a great man belonging to times long past there generally occur some obscure passages. The sole clue to such passages is that one afforded by the known character of the man and the general tenor of his acts; for then the part is interpreted by the whole, as honesty requires. (A.D. 1504.) ARGUMENT. Not long before his death Columbus receives the news of Queen Isabella's death, learning at the same time that greater cruelties than those he had recently witnessed in the Indies had since then been inflicted on the native race—cruelties which had daily increased during the five years since he had been deprived of his viceregal authority. The Queen is dead: four days the huge round earth Has been a tomb. To Spain her death is judgment; To the Indies—to the total West—'tis ruin! Long since and oft by mandates signed and sealed She swore to all who bore her high commission ‘Make ye those Indians free men!’ They are slaves: She sped me from her death-bed tidings of them; They reached me with the tidings of her death: An Indian Queen, their noblest, Anacaona, Friendliest to us till racked by Spanish crimes, Was snared but late, then slain—her chiefs made slaves! Ovando, he that fills my seat, had done it. Made slaves! But three months since I saw their slaves! Then first I fully learned what slavery means When demons are the masters. Slaves! What are slaves? In ancient times we know Slavery at least had pretext. Lawless tribes Reduced, revolters quelled in honest war Were slaves, though ofttimes kindly used. This hour What means that word? It means man's meekest race Scourged to their river-brims and groping there Blind hands and blinder eyes—groping for gold. It means the prince deposed; the children orphaned; It means the fugitive youth by bloodhounds chased; It means whole tribes in council met and there Each man self-slain. Twelve years ago—no more— I leaped on that new shore and blessed its Maker! That hour a doubt there clutched me by my throat. Ere three years passed they left their herds, their flocks, Starved 'mid their forests. Sins till then unknown Our teaching, our bequest, wrought death on others— We Christians did that work. The race will vanish: The vengeance—that remaineth! From the first They loved us; fain had worship'd us; drew near With widening wondering eyes: they brought the kid The lamb. I cried, ‘Behold those gracious looks! That boon they seek is Christ.’ On nearer knowledge I found them chaste and honest, yea devout Though to false gods. They neither stole nor lied. That morn I sailed from Spain a monk addressed me My host at old Rabida's cloistral home On Palos' chestnut-shaded steep far seen; ‘Fair are thine omens, Christopher Columbus! Saint Christopher was that giant who, staff-propt Bore on bent neck that Babe across the strait: Thou bear'st him o'er a stormier sea. Columba! A Dove it was wafted that olive spray: Thou bearest God's Fruit of Life!’ Ah me, ah me! I bore the Cross, not Creed! Whose sin was that? Was it theirs who stretched their hands to Christ, or ours Who, preaching Christ in word, in act denied Him? We named those isles ‘Conception,’ ‘Santa Cruz’— These things we did—and one beside—we made Christ's Faith, thus honoured, unbelievable. How oft of old I made confession thus, ‘'Twas not from compass, measured sphere, old books I won my faith in that far western world: Mine was an Inspiration from above!’ With what a smile quivering on tortured lips The Indian might reiterate my words, ‘An Inspiration!’ Could I have foreseen— The men who shared with me my earliest voyage Were men devout who loved the Indians well: To these I gave waste lands: the native race Served them for hire. Ere long I sailed for Spain: The wonders of that West were noised abroad, Its gold, its gems. Then darkened God's fair heaven; Yea, where the carcase lay, the eagles flocked, Prodigals disgraced, adventurers without honour Rushed o'er the waves. They bought new lands for nought; Headlong they hurled the natives on the mines— I knew not yet the worst. 'Twas thirst for gold! It spread like plague from spotted face to face: I saw the human semblance rot beneath it. The Monks denounced slave-holders day and night; They stood betwixt the living and the dead With arms far stretched. The Queen, the King, the Laws Frowned on the sin. What made their protests null? What makes a mockery of them to this hour? A knot of merchants vile by distance screened; Bribed governors, trencher-priests the Gospel's shame Casuists who cancelled Christ. Through them He bleeds Before the New World's gates. Spain shared that crime! She lacked the simple aim, the ‘single eye’: Her statesmen wished the Indians well, but willed— Not Ximenes—far more that Spain should stand Full-mirrored in her every attribute Alcaldes, Procurados, Alguazils Where'er her sceptre ruled— Spain should have sent the West but missionaries; Right gladly had they sailed and burned their ships! The monks it was that Christianized the lands God and their own right hand their inspiration, Not statesmen—seldom kings— They would have left their martyrs; won the Pagans. The omitted duty to committed sin Strode with a giant's strides. Weighed and found wanting! Not Spain alone; a world whose boast was Christ Had sat enthroned for ages. Then from heaven God's strong right hand let down God's golden scales: This was God's test. ‘From age to age,’ He said, ‘I gave to thee My Kingdom and My Truth And made thee wondrous in the Gentiles' eyes: That done I lifted high the veil, and shewed thee A stone-blind people wandering in deep night: I bade thee lay thy hand in benediction Down on that people's head. Thou stretch'dst it forth;— Then centuries of thy sins prevailed against thee: That people knelt:—it rose to Leper changed And vanished in the darkness.’ Weep for me, Earth! And thou wide Heaven compassionate my woe! Yea all who love the right! The Queen is dead: The Truth looks on me from those great dead eyes— Who lives that ne'er at one unhappy hour Warred on the sacred tenor of a life? I was the Indians' friend; and well they knew it; Yet once—but once—walking by earthly lights Swerved from the perfect way. That Thought, that Thought Hung ever o'er my sick-bed, pointing West: There hung it all that night when died the Queen: It said ‘Remember!’ When have I forgotten? Intrigues of State had kept me long in Spain: Westward returned I found an Indian race In mad revolt against us and subdued them. Then came worse trial. Roldan's mutiny raged That wiliest of that wily Spanish race: The man had dowered his crew with lands slaveworked; Desperate his crew; my friends but few nor trusty. He beckoned to the Indian race; it rose— Such fratricidal war, thus complicated, Could only end in universal slaughter And my New World abandoned, yea, abhorred. The few I still could trust whispered ‘Beware!’ Then only in my life I temporized: I sealed those cessions made to Roldan's tools: To balance these on true men I conferred Lands of revolted natives changed to slaves Rebels not pardoned. Never had I designed That bondage should be lasting. Laws of mine In time had raised them first to serfs then freemen. To the King I wrote, ‘They dragged from me these terms: King, cancel or confirm them.’ He confirmed them: That royal confirmation I confirm not Nor condemnation shun from righteous men Rightly informed. Las Casas disapproved: The Queen reproved me: knaves outstripped my orders: What if worse miscreants falsified my letters? At first my star appeared to reach its zenith; I trusted not that promise; from that hour I trusted none—nor others, nor myself. Roldan renewed his plots; traitors their treasons; False tidings reached the King: he plucked me down. Five years were passed in shipwrecks, frauds and wrongs: The platform laid by me had never trial: The rebel and the just alike were slaved. But once again I trod that Isle. Misrule Had changed it to a Hell. Not less that day Will come when Nations shall resound my praise! I trample on such glories. In my youth My least ambition was to find those Indies; My chief was this:—to lead a Christian host Its cost defrayed by new-discovered worlds, Myself to Palestine or serve content Among its meanest ranks. That king knew all:— I promised him new realms and named my terms: I swore: and kept my vow. He filched my guerdon Like huckstering churl; left me a bankrupt hand To launch a new crusade upon the East. Spain with his fraud connived. The worse for her! That gold she ravished from the Indian streams Will pamper first her vices, after that Famish her honest industry, then leave her Stripp'd bare, a beggar in the winter sun. Europe that shared the guilt will share the penance Surfeit without, but leanness in the soul; Devoutest deeds, delight of harpers old, Will kindle hearts no more; earlier crusades That day be noted but for blots that blurred them Like dark spots on the sun— Loyalty next will perish: Liberty Kneel to the despot throned on money-bags False Nobles traffic make of Faith and Honour Propping with ravished Church-lands starveling homes; Brambles usurp Religious shrines; her chalice Brighten the feaster's board. Sin's fire this day Pastures, a glutton, on the fair green tree; Will it spare the dry? Behold my gifts to man! I will'd to find new worlds: I marred the old: To spread Christ's Realm: I fouled it with disgrace; My greater task remains a dream abortive: My work consummate proves a monster birth— The churl who spurned me back to Spain in chains Was Prophet and inspired! Four days; four nights Since last I closed my eyes! What strains are these? What dew celestial weighs my eyelids down? I shall awake renewed or die in slumber. [He falls asleep.] Thank God! That slumber saved me. When it fell The noontide scorched me; now the sun is setting: In sleep I heard angelic choirs: they sang ‘The Woe is past!’ Hark! now a different strain! Those mild Franciscans chaunt their vesper psalms; How like those psalms they sang at loved Rabida! I smell its thymy height! Thank Heaven, they first Sang Mass on Indian shores! The fever's gone! A light creeps o'er me like that dawn which crept At last o'er waveless waters as we lay Close-anchored by that Indian Isle first kenned San Salvador. Ah me, again that wail! Four days I heard it as the sun descended While from yon Minster's cave-like portals streamed That crowd black-stoled crying ‘The Queen is dead.’ Poor fools! Poor fools! To cry ‘The Queen is dead’; That were to say that Virtue's self can die. Of all her Virtues Love was still the root: Others need many virtues; she but one; Through Love her Faith believed; her hope upsoared; Through Love she saw in everything God's Image Not knowing that round her lived that clime which drives Base things to dens and holes. She is not dead! O great and holy creature, sweet and brave, By nature great, sun-clad by more than nature, So spirit-free and yet so bound by duty, So queenly yet so humble— O type of faithfulness in word and deed, O Flower of all perfections known on earth, O pledge of those that bloom alone in heaven That heaven her presence makes more heavenly still— She is not dead: now first she lives. All hail Thou day of days when I beheld her first! 'Twas at Granada's siege. Spain's leaguering force Had done its part: yet summer heats unceasing Had marred its martial beauty. A shout was heard: On steed snow-white she rode into the war: At once the battle brightened in her beam: At once a spirit of life rushed forth through all things: That plain between the city and the snows Glistened ere long; a tournament shone round us; Dusk Arab chiefs with nobles and with knights Fresh from their towers in Aragon and Castile Encountered daily 'neath their ladies' eyes: The Queen's white crest was ever 'mid the foremost! I saw it swooping through Granada's gates. My breast swelled larger for the wounds it bore. Come what come may that war was a Crusade! O God, how dire a storm has raged around me! How strange this respite! What if half those storms That wreck us be but storms ourselves have raised? One Storm there is sent from the Eternal Stillness, Sent in God's Love. In that supreme of Trials When earth beneath us heaves and in our soul Huge gulfs, so seems it, open that presage Not death, not death—but worse—Annihilation, Even then God's peace is nigh. That storm's Illusion! It is a Spirit that rushes at that hour Through air unmoved! We, clinging to His skirts, Mistake for Storm that Spirit's onward flight: And cling the closest when that flight is fleetest: 'Tis then the Soul makes way. Teach us, great God, That in the Storm of Centuries not less Man's total Race makes progress like the Man They most perchance the Races trampled most, Progress through agonies from nought to Thee, 'Tis so! It must be so! O Suffering Race Through Him ye know not and the world less knows, They least who boast His Name but mock His Laws, Thy Suffering must be somehow joined with His, Must draw from His some grace expiatory, Must make for all Earth's Sufferers intercession Crying beneath God's altar ‘Lord, how long?’ That lore we should have taught thee teach to us Then when thy crown is golden, ours of thorn! This is thy day of anguish:—ay but God Counts every tear thou shed'st and lays His Hand Numbering its pulses down upon thy heart; Leads thee through pain to peace, from peace to glory:— Pardon, high Sufferers, if I mourned your wrong: God's Angels bless it! Ages while our Race From sin to sorrow works its way below That Race we scourged shall triumph in yon skies! Its Land perchance rule earth, that Land it loved; That Land which never will forget its sorrows. The Timeless works through Time. Your time will come: Asia is dead: Europe survives a while: A few more centuries, and her crown will fall! Sad Western Land so long without a name— Let it be never mine—I am unworthy— What if thy pangs presage some lordlier birth Than Earth has witnessed yet? Thy destined Race, When that which now laments hath passed to glory That Race shall be a nobler Race than Spain's, A Race that rivets not the bond but breaks it, A race the children of some Land which now Names thee the Sunset World! It little knows The Sunrise of the Future is with thee Though thunder-showers whose rain was rain of blood Proved its sad omen! Every sunset casts A circling sunrise round the sphere before it; Yon orb back-gazing now on Seville's towers— An angry gaze methinks, a sanguine gaze— Will dawn in turn on Ganges, Salem, Rome, Then light once more these coasts. A Spiritual Sun Our Christian Sun ‘with healing on its wings’ Rides on not less through spiritual heavens Cinctures our Planet still with trailing skirts Of spiritual radiance. Centuries make its day, Centuries its night; and each successive day May pass—will pass the earlier thrice in splendour. Christ's first Great Day hath clasped but half our earth; As yet not half Earth's Races name His Name: A Second comes; and then the endless End. Land of high Hope, there lived who knew and loved thee! She died—our Queen—to plead thy cause in Heaven! I wrought my little work: others will mend it: I said of old, ‘Inter with me my chains!’ I say it now; but add, in sager sense, ‘That so all memory of my wrongs may cease That this was Columbus' noble aspiration is proved by a letter of his written late in life. Nor move in ignorant men a futile spleen.’ I deem those chains the best of my possessions— Wrongs! Had I wrongs? Not I but those poor Indians! THE DEATH OF COPERNICUS. Copernicus died at Fraemberg, a small city at the mouth of the Vistula, A.D. 1543, and, as has been said, though the fact is not certain, the day after he received the first printed copy of that great work, dedicated to Pope Paul III., which embodied his astronomical discoveries, and substituted the Copernican for the Ptolemaic system of the universe. That work he had withheld from publication for thirty-six years, fearing lest the conclusions he had arrived at might possibly prove unsound scientifically, and, in that case, till confuted, be dangerous to Faith. These misgivings he had discarded on re-examining the grounds of his philosophy. Hail, silent, chaste, and ever sacred stars! Ye bind my life in one! I well remember When first your glory pierced my youthful heart: 'Twas Christmas Eve near midnight. From a boat I watched you long; then, rowing, faced the deep: Above the storm-loved cliff of Elsinore Sworded Orion high and higher rose With brightening belt. The city clocks struck twelve: Straight from the countless towers rang out their chimes Hailing the Babe new-born. Along the sea Vibration waved; and in its depth the stars Danced as they flashed answering that rapturous hymn ‘Glory to God on high and peace on earth.’ I shall not long behold them, saith my leech: He errs: I suffer little. On my bed Yon lies my tome—one man's bequest to men. Is the gift good? From youth to age I toiled A gleaner in the starry harvest field: Lo, there one gathered sheaf— I think I laboured with a stainless aim If scarce a single aim. In ancient times Pythagoras had gleams of this high lore: Let coming ages stamp his name upon it; I count it his, not mine. My earlier book In substance was as this. But thus I mused; Christ's simple ones may take offence and cry ‘'Tis written, “God hath made the earth so strong Nothing can move it;” Science this avers It moves around the sun.’ Such questioner Deserves all reverence. Faith is more than Science: But 'twixt the interpretation and the text Lies space world-wide. That text meant this—no more— So solid is the earth concussion none, Though mountains fell, can shake it. Here is nought Of motion round the sun. Solidity To such advance condition were, not hindrance: Far flies the pebble forward flung; the flower Drops at the flinger's foot. Again I mused; The Truth of Nature with the Truth Revealed Accords perforce; not so the illusive gloss By Nature's scholiasts forced on Nature's page: That gloss of Ptolemy's made great Nature lie A thousand years and more. Through countless errors Thus only, Science gropes her way to Truth. May I not err like Ptolemy? Distrustful I hid my book for thirty years and six Cross-questioning with fresh inquest patient skies, And found there nothing that arraigned my lore Much that confirmed it. From the Minster tower, Canon that time at Warnia though unworthy, I made me charts of angle, sine, and arc:— Those vigils left my feet so numbed at morn They scarce could find the altar-step, my hands Scarce lift the chalice! Day by day I prayed With adjuration added, ‘If, my God, Thou seest my pride suborn my faculties Place me a witless one among thy witless Who beg beneath church porches.’ Likewise I sued The poor beside whose beds I ministered— For their sake I had learned the healing craft— To fence me with their prayers. Discovered Truths I blabbed not to the crowd, but whispered them To the wary—wise, and these alone. In these I found amazement less than I presaged: There seemed a leaning in the minds of men, As when a leaning cornfield shews the wind, To such results as in Bologna's schools Made way when there I dwelt. I note this day The ecclesiastics of the higher sort Are with me more than those whose lore is Nature; These hate the foot that spurns prescription's fence; Not so my friend, the bishop of old Kulm; He cries, ‘Go forward!’ Thirty years ago Milan's famed painter—he of the ‘Last Supper’— Whispered me thus, ‘The earth goes round the sun.’ There are whose guess is prophecy. This night I make election: twofold choice is mine; The first, to hurl this book on yonder sea; The last, to fling it on a flood more vast And fluctuating more—the mind of man Crying, ‘Fare forth and take what God shall send!’ One doubt alone remains; no text it touches But dangers from within. In days gone by Near me a youth beside a casement stood, The sea not distant and a heaven all stars: Christ's Advent was our theme. He cried, ‘Look forth! Yon skies confute the old Faith! When Earth was young Wistful as lovers, credulous as children, Men deemed our Earth the centre of the world, The stars its lackeys and its torch-bearers. Such science is foredoomed: mankind will learn This sphere is not God's ocean but one drop Showered from its spray. Came God from heaven for that? Speak no more words!’ That was a tragedy! A mood may pass; yet moods have murdered souls. It proved not thus with him. I looked again: That face was as an angel's: from his brow The cloud had passed. Reverent, I spake no word: Later, albeit at times such moods recurred, That man was helpful to a nation's soul: In death he held the Faith. This Earth too small For Love Divine! Is God not Infinite? If so, His Love is infinite. Too small! One famished babe meets pity more from man Oft than an army slain! Too small for Love! Was Earth too small to be by God created? Why then too small to be redeemed? The sense Sees greatness only in the sensuous greatness: Science in that sees little: Faith sees nought: The small, the vast, are tricks of earthly vision: To God, that Omnipresent All-in-Each, Nothing is small, is far. More late I knew A hoary man dim-eyed with restless hands A zealot barbed with jibe and scoff still launched At priest and kings and holy womanhood: One night descending from my tower he spake; ‘A God, and God incarnate but for man, That reasoning beast—and all yon glittering orbs In cold obstruction left!’ Diverse those twain! That youth, though dazzled by the starry vastness And thus despising earth, had awe for God: That grey-haired fool believed in matter only. Compassion for those starry races robbed By earth, like Esau of their birthright just, Was pretext. They that know not of a God How know they that the stars have habitants? 'Tis Faith and Hope that spread delighted hands To such belief? no formal proof attests it. Concede them peopled; can the sophist prove Their habitants are fallen, and need Redemption? Who told him next that no redeeming foot Has trod those spheres? That fresh assumption granted What then? Is not the Universe a whole? Doth not the sunbeam herald from the sun Gladden the violet's bosom? Moons uplift The tides: remotest stars lead home the lost: Judæa was one country, one alone: Not less Who died there died for all. The Cross Brought help to buried nations: Time opposed No bar to Love: why then should Space oppose one? We know not what Time is nor what is Space;— Why dream that bonds like theirs can bind the Unbounded? If Earth be small likelier it seems that Love Compassionate most and condescending most To Sorrow's nadir depths, should choose that Earth For Love's chief triumph, missioning thence her gift Even to the utmost zenith! To the Soul Far more than to the intellect of man I deemed the gift vouchsafed when on me first This new-born Science dawned. I said, ‘Long since We call God infinite: what means that term? A boy since childhood walled in one small field Could answer nothing. He who looks on skies Ablaze with stars, not hand-maids poor of earth But known for worlds of measureless bulk and swiftness, Has mounted to another grade of spirit, Proceeded man. The stars do this for man; They make Infinitude imaginable: God, by our instincts felt as infinite, When known becomes such to our total being, Mind, spirit, heart, and soul. The greater Theist Should make the greater Christian. True it is Best gift may come too soon. No marvel this: The earth was shaped for myriad forms of greatness As Freedom, Genius, Beauty, Science, Art, Some extant, some to be. Such forms of greatness Are, through God's will, greatness conditional: Where Christ is greatest these are great; elsewhere Great only to betray. Sweetly and sagely In order grave the Maker of all Worlds Still modulates the rhythm of human progress; His Angels on whose song the seasons float Keep measured cadence: all good things keep time Lest Good should strangle Better. Aristotle Aspired like me to base on fact and proof Nature's philosophy. Fate said him nay: That Fate was kindness hidden— Material Knowledge, man's too soon, perchance Had slain unborn man's spiritual knowledge. The natural science of great Aristotle Died young: his logic lived and helped God's Church To map her Christian Science. Ancient Thought And Christian Faith, opposed in much beside, Held Man in reverence, each. Much came of that: Matter dethroned, a place remained for spirit: Old Grecian song called Man creation's lord; The Christian Creed named him his Maker's Image; One was a humble reverence; one a proud: Science that day perchance had made men prouder: The Ptolemaic scheme had place and use Till Christian Faith conquering the earth had crowned it: The arch complete its centering is removed: That Faith which franchised first the Soul of man Franchises next his Mind. Another knowledge Man's appanage now, was snatched awhile from men, The Lore of antique ages said or sung: It rolled, a river through the Athenian vales; It sank, as though by miracle, in earth; A fount unsealed by hand divine, it leaps Once more against the sun. That strange new birth Had place when first I trod Italian soil: Men spake of bards to Dante's self unknown, To Francis, Bernard, Dominic, Aquinas: Great Albert knew them not. The oracles Of lying gods were dumb: but dumb not less The sage Greek poets, annalists, orators, For God had uttered voice and leaned from heaven Waiting the earth's response. The air was mute, Mute for the Saviour God had breathed it late, Left it His latest sigh. The ages passed: Alone were Apostolic voices heard; Then Fathers of the Church; the Schoolmen last. Clamour surceased: the ‘Credo’ for that cause Was plainlier heard. The winds and waves had fallen; And there was a great calm—stillness of spirit At heart of storm extern. At last God's Truth Had built o'er earth the kingdom of God's Peace: The penance-time had passed: Greece spake once more: What was that speech but prophecy fulfilled ‘The heathen shall become thy heritage?’ Euphrates and Ilissus flow again; The grey waste flowers. New greatness nears us now Shall not God's angels reap two harvest fields First Letters; Science next? Severance is needful, Yea, needfuller yet will prove as ages pass. The nobler songs of Greece divulged in verse Such Truths as Nature had retained though fallen, Man's heart had prized. Ay, but with these there mixed Music debasing. Christendom this day Confronts two gifts, and trials likewise twain: She must become the mother of great Nations; Each Nation with the years will breed its Book, Its Bible uninspired. But if these Books Should prove but sorcerers' juggling wares, these prophets Stand up false prophets and their word a lie, A Voice from those two Books of Greece and Rome Will sound their sentence, crying; ‘In the night We sang sweet songs the auguries of dawn; We sang the Mother-land, the household loves, The all-reverend eld, the virgin sanctitude, The stranger's Right, the altar reared to Pity;— Ye, 'mid the noontide glories turned to black, Outshamed our worst with worse.’ Should that voice peal, Woe to the Nations which have sinned that sin! Truth's golden bowl will at the cistern break, Song's daughters be brought low. For these two gifts, The Science new, the Old Lore revived, the time Seems opportune alike. The earth finds rest: That Rome which warred on Christ is judged; has vanished; Those direful heresies of three centuries more, The hordes barbaric, and, barbaric thrice, Those Christian Emperors vexing still Christ's Church:— The Antipopes are gone; the Arabian prophet Scowls at the West in vain. Yet who can tell If in some age, remote or near, a cloud Blacker than aught that shook the olden world May rush not from clear skies? That hour upon us ‘Quieta non movere’ may become Wisdom's sum total; to repress not spur Progressive thought the hour's necessity; Against their will the truthfullest spirits may cry, ‘Better to wait than launch the bark of knowledge There when the breakers roar!’ Work on and fear not! Work, and in hope, though sin may cheat that hope: Work, knowing this, that, when God's lesser gifts Are mocked by mortals, God into that urn Which stands for aye gift-laden by His throne Thrusts deeplier yet His hand and upward draws His last—then chief—of mercies—Retribution. Should man abusing use this knowledge vast Not for relieving of God's suffering poor But doubling of their burthens; not for peace But keener sharpening of war's battle-axe, And viler solace of the idle and rich, God will to such redouble pain for sin. Such lot may lie before us. This is sure That, as colossal Sanctity walks oft In humblest vales, not less a pigmy race May strut on mountains. If from heights of science Men should look forth o'er worlds on worlds unguessed And find therein no witness to their God, Nought but Man's Image chaunting hymns to Man, ‘Great is thy wisdom, Man, and strong thy hand,’ God will repay the madness of that boast With madness guilty less—a brain imbecile. Races there live, once sage and brave, that now Know not to light a fire! If impious men Press round Truth's gate with Intellect's fleshlier lust— For what is Godless Intellect but fleshly?— Sudden a glacial wind shall issue forth And strike those base ones blind! Should that day come Let no man cease from hope. Intensest ill Breeds good intensest. For the sons of God That knowledge won by bad men will survive. If fleets one day should pass the storm in swiftness That Cross which lights their prow will reach but sooner The lands that sit in night. If Empires new Wage war on Faith each drop of martyr blood Will sow once more Faith's harvest. Virgin spirits Raised from a child-like to an angel pureness, Will walk in Chastity's sublimer flame; God's earthquake shake men to their fitting places, True men and false the sons of light and night, No more, as now, confused. God's Church will make Since, though she errs not yet her best may err, For sins of good men dead due expiation, Then for her second triumph claim as site A planet's, not an empire's girth. True Kings Will fence their thrones with freemen not with serfs; True priests by serving rule. The Tree of Life First made our spirits food, that Tree which slew us Will prove her sister. Knowledge then will clasp Supremacy o'er matter, earth's fruition Not by the plucking of a fruit forbidden But by the valorous exercise austere Of faculties, God's gift. ‘Lift up your heads, Ye everlasting gates,’ the Psalmist sang, ‘So shall the King of Glory enter in.’ Lives there who doubts that when the Starry Gates Lift up their heads like minster porches vast At feasts before a marvelling nation's eyes And shew, beyond, the universe of God Lives there who doubts that, entering there, man's mind Must see before it far a God Who enters Flashing from star to star? Lives there who doubts That those new heavens beyond all hope distent Must sound their Maker's praise? Religion's self That day shall wear an ampler crown; all Truths Though constellated in the Church's Creed Yet dim this day because man's mind is dim, Perforce dilating as man's mind dilates O'er us must hang, a new Theology, Our own yet nobler even as midnight heavens Through crystal ether kenned more sharply shine Than when mist veiled the stars! Let others doubt— My choice is made. The stars! Once more they greet me! Thanks to the wind that blows yon casement back; 'Tis cold; but vigils old have taught me patience. Is this the last time, O ye stars? Not so— 'Tis not the death-chill yet. Those northern heavens Yield me once more that Northern Sign long loved; Yon sea is still its glass, though many a star Faints now in broader beams. Yon winter moon Has changed this cell thick-walled and ofttimes dim Into a silver tent. O light, light, light, How great thou art! Thou only, free of space, Bindest the universe of God in one: Matter, methinks, in thee is changed to spirit:— What if our bodies, death subdued, shall rise All light—compact of light! I had forgotten Good Cardinal Schomberg's missive: here it lies: I read it three weeks since. ‘The Holy Father Wills that your labours stand divulged to man; Wills likewise that his name should grace your tome As dedicate to him.’ I read in haste: ‘His Name,’—that such high grace should 'scape me thus Argues, I think, some failure of my powers. So be it! Their task is wrought. The tide descends, The caves send forth anew those hoarse sea-thunders Lulled when full flood satiates their echoing roofs. They tell me this, that God, their God, hath spoken And the great deep obeys. That deep forsakes The happy coasts where fishers spread their nets, The fair green slopes with snowy flocks bespread, The hamlets red each morn with cloaks of girls And loud with shouting children. Forth he fares To solitudes of ocean waste and wide Cheered by that light he loves. I too obey: I too am called to face the Infinite, Leaving familiar things and faces dear Of friends and tomes forth leaning from yon wall: Me too the Uncreated Light shall greet When cleansed to bear it. O, how sweet was life! How sweeter must have been had I been worthy— Grant me Thy Beatific Vision, Lord: Then shall those eyes star-wearied see and live! February 1889. Sonnets on Mediæval Science and Art. SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS. He left the fortress-palace of his sires: The blood of princes coursing through his veins Flushed him no more with pride's insurgent fires Than streams, hill-born, make proud the sundered plains: He loved that lowly life the world disdains; Contemned the insensate pomp that world admires;— He walked, in soul conversing with those choirs That sing where peace eternal lives and reigns. Tender Loretto to her breast elate Caught him a youngling. Silent, meek, serene, His small feet sought the poor beside her gate That wondered at the brightness of his mien Even then a holy creature dedicate To Wisdom's regal seat and sacred Queen. Beauteous Campania! In the old Roman morn The great ones of the nations rushed to thee: In thy rich gardens by the full-voiced sea Wearied they slept, and woke like men re-born. Not so the greatest of thy sons! In scorn He passed the snare; his spirit strong and free Less honouring Pestum's roses than that thorn The crown of Calvary's Victim. Who was he? The Ascetic who refused a prelate's throne Lest worldly aims with cares divine should mix; The Builder lifting fanes of thought not stone, Far less poor Babel Towers of sun-burnt bricks; The man who summed all Truth, The allusion is to the Summa Theologiœ. yet drew alone His sacred science from his crucifix. Great Saint! In pictures old a sun there flamed Soft sphere of radiance on thy vest of snow; It taught us that from hearts by sin unshamed, The mind's inspirer best, alone could flow Sapience like thine. ‘Master of those who know!’ At heaven's high mark alone thy shaft was aimed: Therefore, by thee unwoo'd by thee disclaimed Science terrestrial sought thy threshold low. Beneath thy cell she knelt: all pagan lore From mines of Plato and the Stagyrite To thee she tendered. Thou, with spiritual light Piercing each ingot of that golden ore, To gems didst change them meet to pave the floor Of God's great Temple on the empyreal height. GIOTTO'S CAMPANILE AT FLORENCE. Enchased with precious marbles pure and rare How gracefully it soars and seems the while From every polished stage to laugh and smile Playing with gleams of that clear southern air! Fit resting-place methinks that summit were For a descended Angel! happy isle Mid life's rough sea of sorrow force and guile For Saint of royal race or vestal fair In this seclusion—call it not a prison— Cloistering a bosom innocent and lonely. O Tuscan Priestess! gladly would I watch All night one note of thy loud hymn to catch Sent forth to greet the sun when first, new-risen, He shines on that aërial station only! OLD PICTURES AT FLORENCE. Thrice happy they who thus before man's eyes Restored the placid image of his prime; Illustrating th' abortive shows of Time With gleams authentic caught from Paradise. Those Godlike forms are men! Impure disguise By Man now suffered! O for wings to climb Once more to Virtue's mountain seats sublime And be what here we poorly recognize! From these fair pictures our Humanity Looks down upon us kindly. 'Tis no dream:— Truth stands attested by Consistency; Here all the Virtues meet in peace supreme So meet, so blend, that in those Forms we see The sum of all we are and fain would be. ON A PICTURE BY COREGGIO AT PARMA. Paint thou the pearl gates of the Morning Star Loftiest of Painters and the loveliest For only of thy pencil worthy are Those ever-smiling mansions of the blest! Thyself when homeward summoned to thy rest Couldst scarce have marked our earth's receding bar: No happier shapes could greet thee near or far Than oft in life thy radiant fancy drest. God when He framed the earth beheld it good; That light from His approving smile that shone For thee waned never from her features wan: Before thine eyes—unfallen if unrenewed— Still moved that Race supreme and fairest made; And Love and Joy, twin stars, still on their foreheads played. COREGGIO'S CUPOLAS AT PARMA. Creatures all eyes and brows and tresses streaming By speed divine blown back:—within, all fire Of wondering zeal and storm of bright desire; Round the broad dome the immortal throngs are beaming: With elemental Powers that vault is teeming: We gaze, and, gazing, join yon fervid choir In spirit launched on wings that ne'er can tire Like those that buoy the breasts of children dreaming. The exquisitest hand that e'er in light Revealed the subtlest smile of new-born pleasure Here sounds the abysses and attains the height, Is strong the strength of heavenly hosts to measure Draws back the azure curtain of the skies And antedates our promised Paradise. A PICTURE BY PIETRO PERUGINO. Glory to God of all fair things the maker For that He dwelleth in the mind of Man! Glory to Man of that large grace partaker For that he storeth thus his spirit's span With shapes our earth creates not, neither can Till like a flood her youth shall overtake her, And voices new to loftier labours wake her High artist then, as now poor artizan. Mark, mark those awful sons of martyrdom With their uplifted hands but eyes down-cast As though the uncreated light had dazed them:— The error of our brief existence past They stand like Saints resurgent from the tomb, Suspended still on that great Voice which raised them! FRESCOES BY MASACCIO. Well hast thou judged that sentence ‘Had ye Faith Ye could move mountains.’ In those forms I see What God at first ordained that Man should be, His Image crowned triumphant over death. Born of that Word which never perisheth Those Prophets here resume the empery Of old in Eden lost. Their eye, their breath Cancels disease, lays prone the anarchy Of Passion's fiercest waves. Secret as Fate Like Fate's the powers they wield are infinite: Their very thoughts are laws: their will is weight— On as they move in majesty and might The demons yield their prey, the graves their dead: And to her centre Earth is conscious of their tread. A TYROLESE VILLAGE. This village, thronged with churches, needeth none: Each house like some old missal rich and quaint Is blazoned o'er with prophet, seer, and saint: Each court a separate sanctity hath won. Here a great Angel stands crowned with the sun: Magdalene there pours her perpetual plaint: There o'er her child the Maiden without taint Bends—as His mercy bends o'er worlds undone. Of earth's proud centres none like this recalls That mystic City in the realms supernal Built upon God, whose light is God alone; The very stones cry out: the eloquent walls Plainly confess that Name the proud disown; The Father's glory and the Son Eternal. AN EARLY PICTURE BY RAFFAEL. Dark, infinitely dark, a midnight blue Those orbs that, resting on the skies, appear To pierce the veil of Heaven and wander through Searching the centre of the starry sphere: Angels, be sure, unseen are hovering near! Their fanning plumes with faintest blush imbue That pearly cheek, a lily else in hue, And from that brow the auburn tresses clear. One hand is laid upon her mantled breast To us an unrevealed paradise, Nor bodied in the ascetic Painter's dream— Hidden it lies in everlasting rest Beneath those purple robes that earthward stream Cyphered with star-emblazoned mysteries. BOCCACCIO AND CERTALDO. The world's blind pilgrims tendering praise for blame, Passing Certaldo, point and smile and stare And with Boccaccio's triumph din the air:— Ah, but for him how high had soared thy fame Italian Song! False Pleasure is a flame That brands the Muses' pleasaunce; burns it bare As some volcanic isle with barren glare: O Italy! exult not in thy shame! 'Twas here, 'twas here thy Song's crystalline river Lost its last sight of hoar Parnassus' head And swerved through flowery meads to sandy bar: Its saintly mission here it spurned for ever: It sighed to Laura, and with Tancred bled But caught no second flash from Dante's star! I. THE CAMPO SANTO AT PISA. There needs not choral song nor organ's pealing:— This mighty cloister of itself inspires Thoughts breathed like hymns from spiritual choirs While shades and lights in soft succession stealing Along it creep, now veiling now revealing Strange forms here traced by Painting's earliest sires, Angels with palms and purgatorial fires And Saints caught up and demons round them reeling. Love, long remembering those she could not save Here hung the cradle of Italian Art: Faith rocked it: hence, like hermit child, went forth That heaven-born Power which beautified the earth: She perished when the world had lured her heart From her true friends, Religion and the grave. II. THE CAMPO SANTO AT PISA. Lament not thou: the cold winds as they pass Through the ribbed fret-work with low sigh or moan Lament enough; let them lament alone Counting the sear leaves of the innumerous grass With thin, soft sound like one prolonged alas! Spread thou thy hands on sun-touched vase or stone That yet retains the warmth of sunshine gone, And drink warm solace from that ponderous mass. Gaze not around thee. Monumental marbles Time-clouded frescoes mouldering year by year Dim cells in which all day the night-bird warbles— These things are sorrowful elsewhere not here: A mightier Power than Art's hath here her shrine: Stranger! thou tread'st the soil of Palestine! THE FEAST OF ST. PETER'S CHAIR AT ANTIOCH; OR, THE DEAD PATRIARCHATES. At Antioch first the Name of Christ Came down and clothed His Race: Enthroned at Antioch Peter reared His earlier resting-place. O Eastern Church! Imperial Schism Swept from thy forehead crown and chrism: Loose from the fold thy Cæsars broke: Thy penance came—the Moslem yoke! O Eastern Church so great of old What art thou at this hour? God called thee! why that backward gaze Servile to mortal Power? Thou stand'st amid the salt sand-waste A queenly statue fire-defaced; A Pillar wrecked of sentenced Pride, A dead Faith's Image petrified! Eastward, heaven-warned, the Empire ranged; Byzantium ruled, not Rome: Westward the Church; the Vatican Not Salem was her home. Like ships that each the other pass Swift-borne through mist o'er seas of glass Those Spirits of a converse lot Each other crossed and answered not. Of all those Patriarchal Thrones Whereon the Apostles sate But one survives, the bond and seal Of Christ's Episcopate: There Peter reigns, and by his side That great compeer St. Paul. who with him died; One walked the Gentiles' utmost bound, One sate, the Church's centre crowned. The Alexandrian altar fell, Jerusalem, like thine, Poor Reliquaries they of Faith This hour, no more the Shrine: Chalcedon, Ephesus, and Nice, The Councils like the Arts of Greece, Their names are fair in sacred lore; The spirit of Life is theirs no more. Thus in the dust of centuries sleep The glories once so bright; Rome, Rome alone whose vigil lasts Through all the wandering night Still marks with awe and notes with care The spots where orbs that are not were: Her Ephemerides retain Their names and places—not in vain. The Pilot of the Barque divine Still sees as on he steers Sad Antioch's ever-setting star O'erhang the seas of years; Sees rather where it shone of old A radiance posthumous and cold, A monitory gleam and grand Impassive as a dead man's hand. Dread monument! 'Tis thine to lay That warning Hand and frore On breasts of panting kings and realms That kings for Gods adore: To freeze the Gentile Hope, to bind The loftier with the lowlier mind, And with the weight of all the past Confirmed that greatness shaped to last. MURILLO'S PICTURE, ‘THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION’. The picture which suggested this poem is in the Church of the Sacred Heart, at Bournemouth, to which it was presented by the late Count de Torre Diaz. To his memory this poem is inscribed. ‘A sign was seen in heaven: a Woman stood; Beneath her feet the Moon.’ That waning moon 'Neath yonder pictured Apparition curved Is Time there dying with his dying months: The Spirit shewed that vision to Saint John Exiled in Patmos Isle. The best beloved Deserved such solace best. She stands in Heaven: Not yet the utmost mountain-peaks of earth Forth from the hoary deep unlifted still Have felt her foot's pure touch. A cloud from God On streaming like a tide thus far hath borne her To the threshold only of the House of Man: Angelic heads and wings beneath her gleam And lily and rose and palm. Her knee is bent: Her moon-like face is tearful with great awe: Her universe is God and other none; Piercing all worlds her gaze is fixed on Him: She waits His Will supreme. Men of good-will Draw near in faith honouring the Mystery! The sunrise of your wondrous world of Faith Was when the Angel spake and at his word Mary believed. Its noon was Pentecost Then when the Church of God stood up sun-clad By Him, the ascended Sun of Righteousness. This is nor noon, nor sunrise. This is dawn, The aurora of those spiritual heavens and earth Decreed, Man's spiritual portion yet to come. For them alone material worlds shall be; Their glory shall but be this pledge fulfilled; Their loveliness shall be but hers writ large; Their fruitfulness the type of hers: her life When time is ripe shall be a music-strain Tuning all harmonies of Time; itself An echo through the centuries prolonged Yea to the gate-ways of Eternity From this first bird-note clear! That painter's hand Wrought well. Yon Virgin's robe, a pearl of dawn, Glitters; yon scarf blown back by her advance Is dark with dews and shades of vanquished night! The raised hands upward pointing from that breast Are matutinal with some heavenlier beam Than streaks our East. That sunless mist behind her Wins but from her its glow. O young fair face— For, though that Form to Maiden-graciousness Hath reached the face is maiden less than child Or, both in one, an earlier mystery Precursor of that Maiden-Motherhood Which blends two gifts divine. Child-Prophet soft— What thoughts are hers? He only knows who sends them! From Him they come; to Him once more ascend. Child-Prophet sad; feels she the destined weight Of crowns and sceptres and the wide earth's praise Honouring earth's humblest? She that would be nought, Was nought with them compared, a crowned Dependance. Must she be Queen of all? Not yet; not yet; Ere comes that day she must be Queen of Woes: This, this is the beginning not the end; A world redeemed must be a world sin-marred: That world as yet exists not. This is She Through whom, though man had never fallen, his God Then too had dwelt with Man—so taught the Seer Scotus.— Not Victim, but Triumphant. Sleep, O Eve, Thy Daughter's foot—yon picture veils yet shews it— Thy Daughter's foot, ‘the Woman's,’ the Foretold, Whose sacred Seed, ‘the Woman's Seed,’ through her Shall bruise the serpent's head not yet subdues it: Not yet yon waning moon hath gazed on guilt: Transience is not transgression. High in spheres No autumn ever touched, the Tree of Life Stands; and close by, as pure, the Tree of Knowledge: The twain commix their lights; the twain are one: All yet is archetypal: all is healing: Not yet the fruit is plucked: not yet God's frown Makes Eden dark. I raise mine eyes once more: That breeze which onward wafts her sucked the flowers That pave the summits of the Hills of God. The ‘Hills of God!’ He sang them well, that bard Father Faber of the Oratory. Great-hearted, who for love of Christ preferred The priestly vestment to the singing robe; Whose monument The Church of the London Oratory. this day stands consummate. Thus sang he, God's Decrees his arduous theme: Thus sang he—song severe, not winged by verse— ‘High on the summits of the Hills of God There spreads a table-land immeasurable; This thought is to be found in one of Father Faber's prose works. Not cherub's eye can grasp it: seraph's flight Reach its remoter verge. Across it moves Alone the ordered march of God's Decrees From infinite distance on to infinite: Their birth-place no man knows.’ Methinks I see them, A cloudy pageant dim yet crowned by fire, A cloudy pageant of advancing Gods, With feet which tread that shadowy stage, nor less With vans outstretched winnowing the air. A breath Strikes on my brow; and strains I hear like sighs Of seas round coasts far distant. Child of Heaven, The First-born, save thy Son, in those Decrees, The Elect, the Immaculate, the Full of grace Which, for that Son's sake, fenced thee from His Foe; Foam-born from seas of Sanctity alone The seas of all the Sanctities of God, And borne—that Six Days' work as yet unwrought— Above the heaving crests of things to be, A Gift predestined, yet a Gift reserved; Say, must that foot which treads yon waning orb Tread later earth, our earth? It will not catch Her taint; but where it treads, those other feet Will leave ensanguined prints—the Feet of God. HYMN. THE FEAST OF ST. PETER'S CHAIR AT ROME. A few lines at the beginning of this poem are taken from a well-known passage in St. Jerome. I fawn not on the Roman height— Cæsarian laurels, wreathe not ye A harp of Christian Psalmody! Whoever builds, but not on Right Though high he build as eagle's flight Can never true acceptance find With manly heart or equal mind. Though every State, though land and sea Though all the flying years of Time Should bend to Power unjust the knee And venerate with rite and rhyme True sway is God's, and his alone Who holds from God a righteous throne. But I the Fisherman revere Who left the Galilean lake And all he loved for Christ's dear sake;— Who left his nets and rules a sphere. Rock of the Rock! From Him alone, Eternal Rock, and Corner Stone, That Name and Function didst thou take Through Him that great Confession make! Rock of the Rock! A Rock is She Who, built on thee and strong by thee, Resounds it everlastingly! ‘And will ye also go away?’— ‘To whom, O Master, shall we go? The words of Life that lasts for aye With Thee are found. Behold we know— We doubt not—we are sure indeed— Thou art the Christ, the expected One; Thou art the Christ, the promised Seed, The Living God's Anointed Son.’ Mystery of Unity, Of all the Mysteries the key! Prime Sacrament that bind'st like Fate Created things and uncreate! Godhead in Persons Three in One: In Him all harmonies began: And from His archetypal throne Descends the chain that ends in Man. In One our Race transgressed and died: In One it lives, the Crucified. ‘One Faith, one Baptism;’—Truth is one For separate Truths or new or old Form still one family one fold One everlasting unison. ‘I say to thee, thou art the Rock; And on this Rock My Church I found: Nor Powers of Hell, nor mortal shock That Church shall level with the ground. And I the Keys will give to thee Of heaven's great Kingdom, earth around: That which thou loosest loosed shall be; And what thou bindest shall be bound.’ The cloud of Time is lifted. Lo! What man is He that, sole and slow, Forth moves o'er Haran's well-loved plain With forehead turned to Canaan? That Unity which Abel's blood Dissolved; which God restored in Seth, Which Noah rescued from the Flood Again Corruption dooms to death. Nimrod has lifted up on high The brand of godless Tyranny: And Anarchy, the converse woe, Has reigned and lies with Babel low. The single, long transmitted Tongue Is broken into dialects: The single Faith, held fast so long Gives way to idols and to sects. That Covenant whose rainbow span Embraced the total hopes of man, Totters and shakes but is not dead. Again through One it rears its head And, narrowing to a centre, forth One day shall spring to clasp the earth. Abraham goes forth! Hail, Patriarch true! He bids the Patriarch world adieu Sole Patriarch of an order new. ‘Simon, behold, your souls to gain, Satan hath longed with longings sore, That he may sift you even as grain Is sifted on the granary floor: But I for thee My prayer have made; That thy Faith fail not, nor decay: Converted once be strong to aid; Strengthen thy Brethren day by day.’ The cloud of Time is raised once more: A city shades a far-off shore; And the red sunset many a mile Burns silent on the silent Nile. An old man dies: around his bed Twelve Patriarch Brethren take their stand: Each kneels: on each he lays his hand: One crowns he—o'er the rest the head. ‘Lion of all the sacred Fold O Judah, in thy strength thou art:— Till Shiloh comes, the King foretold, Thy Sceptre never shall depart.’ The seal of Royal State on one Is pressed once more—on one alone. Long ran the promise underground: Long pined the sacred Race in chains Then, bursting from their prison-bound Retrod at last their Fathers' plains Resurgent from Egyptian glooms That figured first those Catacombs Wherein, for centuries three, abode The Christian Judah sealed by God. The Law was given: a brazen band It fenced from baser realms that land Predestined from the first to be An isthmus in a stormy sea Joining the Patriarchs' Church with her In whom the Apostles minister And making visibly of twain One Church, one Household, and one Reign. Then rose at last the Throne decreed; Who grasped the sceptre? Judah's seed— The Shepherd summoned from above, The sworded man who wept and strove That King heart-frail yet strong through Love. ‘Lovest thou Me with mightier love Than these, thy brethren?’—‘Master, yea; Thou knowest I love Thee.’—‘Simon, prove Thy love and feed My lambs for aye. Lovest thou Me with love more deep Than these, the others?’—‘Master, yea; Thou knowest I love Thee.’—‘Feed My sheep: Shepherd and feed them day by day.’ Who chains that Shepherd? Chain who will, The Evangel is unshackled still! Forth, like an eagle from its eyry Abroad o'er all the world it flies And, poised in regions solitary Gives back the sunset to the skies. The Day of Pentecost had come: Descending from that upper room Who first the Gospel trumpet blew, Opening Christ's Kingdom to the Jew? Before the Gentiles next who laid His great commission, undismayed Washing the feet, and hands, and head Of realms unclean till then and dead? Who, when the Council long had sate, Closed with a word the loud debate? Who with a royal meekness took A younger brother's frank rebuke? ‘Simon, when thou wert young, behold Thy girdle thou didst bind at will; And in the peaceful days of old Thy footsteps freely wandered still: But when thy head is old and grey Thy hands thou shalt stretch forth; and lo Thee shall another gird that day And bear thee where thou wouldst not go.’ A thousand years passed by between The earlier and the later storms Ere yet across the golden scene Rushed back old Error's myriad forms. That Eastern hand which raised again Samaria's altar withered soon, And on that altar bones of men Were burned beneath the Arabian Moon. But, in the West, o'er all the lands The Rock cast far its sacred shade Till regions bare as desert sands Grew green at last with wood and glade. —What Power was that which, strong yet meek, The equipoise of earth maintained Lifted the poor, upheld the weak? That bound the haughty; freed the chained? The Church of God, that Church which wound Around the globe the Apostles' zone— What clasped that zone? that girdle bound? The Roman Unity alone. He who established Power on earth And sanctioned Order and Degree First raised, supreme o'er hut and hearth, The sceptre of Paternity; And next, o'er every realm and nation, The delegated thrones of Kings Within the bounds of civil station Potent above terrestrial things. Lastly he raised and raised o'er all The Sceptre Apostolical. Whoe'er, seduced by pride or fear, Affronts, within its proper sphere That great Pontific dignity— Though Emperor or King he be, Though arms and arts make strong his cause And large pretence of ancient laws O'erlaid by centuries of wrong; Though every pen and every tongue Hail him Deliverer; and the acclaim Of ages echoes back his name— That prince against God's edict fights Sole basis of inferior rights, He that abets betrays him too; A flatterer, and no liegeman true. He Roman is; but takes his side With Pagan Rome self-deified Against the Saviour and the Bride. ‘Not for the world My prayer I make: I pray for those Thou gavest to Me: I taught them all things for Thy sake— Make perfect Thou their Unity: As Thou with Me art One even so Make them My flock in one agree Father, that thus the world may know That I am Thine and come from Thee.’ Who chains the Apostle? Chain who will The hands that bind he blesses still! Them that abhor him them that fly Still, still he follows with his eye As some white peak o'er seaward streams Casts glances far and snowy gleams. They that renounce thee beg thine alms: They live but on thy grace benign; Thine are their Creeds and thine their Psalms: Whate'er they keep of Faith is thine. Whate'er of Truth with them remains Is theirs but in Tradition's right: Their sheep that die on wealthier plains Are pastured on thy hills by night. True Shepherd King! all powers beside Are transient and an empty show: Around thee like a shifting tide The world's great pageants ebb and flow. True pilot of the Saviour's Bark! Who sails with thee is safe: the flood But lifts more high Thy sacred Ark And floats it to the feet of God. Thy God revealed His Son to thee: Thy Maker called thee from above: He chose thee from eternity, He sealed thee with electing love. —Thy Strength is Prayer. For them pray most With love matured in God's own beam Who make of liberty their boast Yet sell true freedom for a dream! Prince of the Apostles! Like an hour The years have passed since first that Word Which signed thee with vicarial power Beside that Syrian lake was heard. O, strong since then, from heaven's far shore Hold forth that Cross of old reversed; O bind the world to Christ once more: The chains of Satan touch and burst. Strengthen the Apostolic Thrones: Make strong without and pure within That Temple built of living stones With planetary discipline: Strengthen the thrones of Kings: the State Encompass with religious awe; Paternal rule corroborate: Impart new majesty to Law: Strengthen the City and the Orb Of Earth till each has reached its term: Insurgent powers and impious curb; The righteous and the just confirm.</field>
