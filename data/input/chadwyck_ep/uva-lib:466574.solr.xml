      <field name="fulltext">“A new poem is a new plague—There is a general avoidance instead of a tumultuous greeting, and our dearest friend becomes less dear to us by the intrusion of a volume of verse, if he is so unreasonable as to expect to be read.”QUARTERLY REVIEW</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. MOON—SUGGESTIVE OF POETIC FEELING, AS OBSERVED IN CHILDHOOD; IN BOYHOOD; IN MANHOOD. CALM MOONLIGHT OVER THE CITY; OVER THE COUNTRY. STORMY MOONLIGHT, AND STONEHENGE SEEN BY A STORMY MOONLIGHT. MOON AS COMBINED WITH THE SEA; WITH MORNING TWILIGHT; WITH EVENING TWILIGHT; WITH THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD; CONCLUSION. MOONLIGHT. Sir Thomas. “God's blessing be upon thee, honest Carnaby! I feared a moon-fall. In our days nobody can think about a plum-pudding, but the moon comes down upon it. I warrant ye this “fellow” here hath as many moons in his poems as the Saracens had in their banners.” W. S. “I have not hatched mine yet, Sir. When I do, I trust it will be worth taking to market.” Walter Savage Landor's Examination of William Shakspeare. Not alway from the lessons of the schools, Taught evermore by those who trust them not, Though in fine phrase tricked out, or bodied forth In solid saw, spring forth the fairest fruits Of wisdom or of duty. Spirits there are Who, rather from the forms of outward nature— Those teachers who in our dull colleges Have never taken degree—rejoice to cull Their doctrine; nutriment to grosser sense, If alien, yet with finer essences Not unassimilate! Such win their lore Through many a sympathy, from “stones, and trees, And running brooks;” from every sound and thing; Yea, from far less; from films of sounds and things; The airiest shadow flitting o'er the mead; The last thin whisper of the evening breeze; The faintest hue that dies along the main. Such thoughts dost Thou, beloved Moon, shed forth For poets, which from them we gather up Not scant; and I have had them of my own, Gentle and fair, and, as I fain would deem, Not unpoetic quite, though never stamped With countermark of verse; I all unskilled Of measure, or the thoughts themselves too swift Or subtile for the workmanship of words: And yet, though woven of thy most delicate rays, Or snatched, as might be, from quick-vanishing stars, Twinkling and gone, not thence, would I believe, Mere passing thoughts, but fitted to endure, For profit of the meditative mind, As yon sweet stars and Thou, fair Moon, endurest. For I have loved Thee from my childhood up Till now; from when, beneath far tropic skies, Forth guided by my ancient Afran nurse, Whose ebon face strange contrast made with Thine, I first observed Thee; and, observing, wondered If those, thy seeming features, nose and mouth, And steadfast eyes, were really such as ours, And asked of her, like wondering. Nor when To these fair isles conveyed, a growing school-boy, From forth our play-ground's narrow boundary, I spied thee, 'mid blue ether, in thy freedom Careering, even like the white-sailed ship That sped me hither; or if I beheld thee, When sultry summer-airs forbade to sleep, Slanting, at midnight, through th' uncurtained window, On the half-testered bed, uncurtained too, Our youngster couch; not then could I withhold To gaze upon Thee; pensive half—half glad, I scarce knew which nor wherefore, with a vague Unsatisfied delight. And as, in days Ere chivalry was gone, some youthful knight, Of high-born damsel, whom he ne'er might reach, Enamoured, worshipped still her peerless beauty, And dress'd his thoughts on hers, and thus imbibed Civility with love; not less, fair Idol, On thee I hung in thy removèd sphere, And duly paid my visionary vows To thy bright purity; nor was the soul, E'en in those stripling-days, as now I deem, Wholly by such communion unrefined. Nor seldom did I win from thy sweet light A more creative and less pensive joy; Such joy as kindly Fancy oft will weave For childhood; kindlier still, if she desert not Our after-years. 'Twas when dim-floating clouds Were hung in the still west, and there had hung From hour of parted twilight. They had watched The sinking Sun's last glory, and caught thence, Around his golden garment clustering, A passing radiance not their own; but now, Though rayless, hueless, still they lingered here, As in persisting love (so spirits, they say, Will hover round loved spots); nor lingered here In vain; for Thou didst bring a second day Less bright than his; but not less beautiful. Sun of the Midnight! Then those pallid clouds, Each in its turn by thy soft light lit up, Grew to a living dream-land. Earth and Sea, In all their shows, were there, with semblances Of man, or beast, or monster. Not an image Through childhood's brain had flitted, won, perchance, From tale of nurse or grandsire, or out-gleaned From story-book, thumbed o'er and o'er again, But there found type or home. What mattered it, In that free hour, of tyrant pedagogue, Or brute school-comrade, tyrant more than he; Or grammar rule, perplexing easy speech; Or cramp obdurate sum, tried ten times o'er On the smeared slate? I recked not of them then— I thought not of them! No discoverer By land or sea, to cape or central range Tacking his own proud name, to dream thenceforth Of immortality;—no conqueror— No! not the Norman, broadly parcelling Among his mailèd knights and barons bold New territory—was more lord than I In that my flaky kingdom; free to give, Make or unmake, at pleasure! Yon far cloud, Floating like island in its sea of sky, Should be the spot for Crusoe! There Saint George Was fighting with the dragon, while below Paced slowly Bunyan's Pilgrim with his staff! There stood the magic steed, which whirled away Young Calmaralzaman; there drove the bark, Rapt fiercely by invisible force along, To split, with Sinbad, on the loadstone shore! But when came classic lessons, and all fresh From lore of Tooke's Pantheon—a new world Peopled with deity—I knew how thine, In the far days of famed Antiquity, Had been no slighted worship; glorious then Of my new knowledge, and fantastical As innocent childhood is, I longed to have been The shepherd youth, of whom then first I read, Endymion; Endymion, loved in Latmos! (Ah! me, quaint shepherd, not of crook, but satchel, And guessing, at that age, how much of love!) And, in my foolishness, almost I craved Those Pagan days again. Then would recur The holy teachings of the primal book, “The Sun to rule the day, and Thou the night,” And wake to wiser musings. Mixture strange Of sacred and profane! Yet each in turn Struck its own chord, and made Thee dearer still. Nor me when onward years had loosed at length From 'prisonment of school-boy, and left free To choose my own observatories, when And where I willed, frank-breathing mountain-top Or wide-viewed plain, did I less love thy light, Sweet Moon; and, e'en amid the revelries Of the mad city, when thy thoughtful beam Hath met me, sliding slow from temple to tower, Or pausing on the broad and silent street, Beneath that pause more broad and yet more silent; How oft hath the wild will of wayward youth Received in Thee a monitor, not vain, To calm and summon home. But if, far rather, Thou wert seen planing o'er some lovely region, From city remote, to thy attempering ray More native; making its day-loveliness Yet lovelier; softening with diffused beauty Near plain; or making with long narrow line The distant sea; or, slanted with soft step Almost to earth, wert streaming light behind Some ancient wood, more forward thence to fling Its huge black outline; Thou thyself chance-spied Through the tall stems; or else wert stealing down The shadowy dingle, pensively to rest By the hushed waters of some bosomed lake; 'Mid scene like this, to love most harmonised, How dearer was thy presence! By such mirror, (Mirror of Dian The lake of Nemi was called by the ancients “Speculum Dianæ.”! aptly named by those Who dwelt near Nemi's wooded wave,) how oft Fixed have I stood to watch thy dream-like image, And then upturned me from the soft reflection To view thy very Self in the high heaven. There wert Thou, with the same unaltered features Which mocked my childhood; features still, indeed, So Science tells, but features of a world, Visible continents and circling seas, With all their promontories. Trancèd thus, (My childish fancies weaned, but love unbated,) How fondly have I longed, how deeply yearned To know Thee nearer; yearned to climb thy hills, And thread thy peaceful valleys; there, perchance, To meet some loved one lost; and well content, With such sweet compensation, to forego This native earth of ours, by folly and guilt Too often marred; and yet, though often marred, Beautiful still; and still more beautiful That Thou, fair Moon! dost shed thy peace upon it. That peace, how deep! this night of thousand stars, That hide themselves abashed from the bold sun, But hang, all fondly, on thy gentler brow— How calm! Yet not o'er calmer skies alone, Mild Moon! is thy dominion: Thou dost sway The very storm to obey thy peacefulness. When winds are piping, and the chargèd clouds, As if out-summoned by that warlike music, First in black squadrons rush; then sternly muster In sullen mass, on either side the heaven, Like armies face to face, with space between; 'Tis then Thou glidest forth; like some pale nun, Unhooded, whom a high and rare occasion Wrests from her sanctuary, to interpose In mortal quarrel, so Thou glidest forth, And lookest thy mild bidding; and the winds Are silent; and those close-compacted clouds, Disbanding, fleet in tender flakes away, And leave the world to thy tranquillity. On such a night it was, so wildly fitful, That Thou, Conductress of my way, didst lead me To where the mighty mystery of Stonehenge Broods o'er the silent plain, and with mute power Rules the vast circuit of its sea-like space, As Thou dost rule the sky. For many a mile I journeyed, pondering on the days when Thou Wert shining o'er the Druid; being to him His Sun, his chronicler of months and years, And sanctifier of his rites most holy! And musing on the rites—the priest—all gone! Thou and that lonely fane the sole abiders! In my inmost spirit I felt how the dead Past Controuls the living Present; binding awe And melancholy, of high strain or low, Not solely on the' imaginative mind, That 'mid mere earthly precinct asks no home, But e'en on fleshlier natures, which escape not Foresight of their own doom, to vanish in turn. So did I reach to where uprose those pillars 'Mid their sepulchral barrows; turfy tombs! Which yet outlast the marble. At the first All indistinctly visioned; but, ere long, When Thou wert lucent in the open path Which winds had swept before Thee, then I saw them In their huge steadfastness; and felt their power Unutterable, and in wonder stood! Then too I longed to chase away those clouds Which still were flocking round Thee, like the ghosts Of fabled Orcus; and to question Thee Of all the past; as the great Florentine, Who saw the triple vision, reverently Questioned mild Maro 'mid the dim sojourn. Say, Moon! for Thou didst shine o'er Paradise From the beginning; its sole light by night, Thou and the stars; ere yet that other light From the preventing sword with double tongue Flamed at the gateway; and hast seen the shepherds In old Chaldæa watchers of those stars, And of thy nightly course, with each event Of after-rolling time; say, who first planned The mystic round of those gigantic columns? Who dragged the masses from their yawning quarries, And planted on such bases as might scorn The earthquake, and uphung rock upon rock? Are they, as some have dreamed, unconquered relics Of a young world; survivors of the flood; Reared by a first-born strength mightier than ours? Or if indeed the work of men like us, In what far cyele? Stood they here before Elder Assyria, or ere Egypt was? Before those pyramids, or ere the towers Of Belus old? Or did they rise, thus rude, And curl their uncouth ring in that same age Which saw the fair-proportioned Parthenon, In its first finish of Pentelic marble, Outsparkle from the hand of Phidias? Say, for Thou knowest; Thou hast seen of each The birth and the old age; hast seen the rites Of either worship, Pallas's or Thine; Beheld thine oaken or her olive-wreath Hung on each altar; and beholdest, now, The vaunted wonder of each famous temple, The Celtic circle and the Grecian frieze, Both ruin-smote! Was it, O Moon! in prescience Of populous champaigns turned to pallid wastes; And temples—fallen; and roofless palaces; And monuments—men know not whose they were; Making our solid earth seem but a play-place For Mutability; was it for this That Thou didst choose the undecaying sea For thy peculiar realm? Towers, built like rocks, Crumble and strew the region; forests old Are treeless wastes; where hills, up-peaked, yawn now Deep gulfs; such foot-marks Mutability Leaves on the land. But, for the ocean-waves, Myriads of sharp-keeled ships have cut athwart them To their safe ports, and left behind no furrow; Ten thousand gallant barks with all their trim Have sunk, yet where they sunk remains no sign; Tempest hath wrenched the Pharos from its rock, And toppled down, with every tended light, To gorge the surge they lit; Earthquake hath flung Whole cities to the deep; yet o'er the fragments, Acanthus, or volute, or fluted column, Or causeway, clattering once with proud-horsed chariot, It rolls as heretofore. This isle of ours What if no Earthquake rend! yet change steals o'er it Slowly, but surely; and, ere yet the half Of our threescore-and-ten be past, we learn The lesson. Nor alone the works of Man, The long-trimmed avenue, or hall ancestral, On which our youngling wonder loved to gaze, Are sought for and are gone; yon very headland Which now thy light is lifting from the waves, Or struck by storm, or fretted by still frost, Wears not the form it wore when, yet an urchin, Timidly bold, I scrambled on its edge Precipitous, and, warned a hundred times, Would still gaze giddily down. And yet the waters Are circling round its base, as seems, no other Than those my childhood knew; and such, no doubt, The woad-stained aboriginal beheld, When his flat coracle from off his shoulder He slipped upon them; such the unflinching Roman Stemmed with the strong oar of his beakèd galley; And such the more impetuous Norman blood Swept through, to win a kingdom in a day. Hence rightly didst Thou make the ocean-waves Thine appanage; their very change constraining To a vicissitude so fixed, that change With them is but renewal.—Storm may smite them, And flash their sprays all round, like wind-tost feathers,— Still they re-plume their beauty; and, like Thee,— Thou, waxing, waning; They, in ebb or flow— Though ever changing are the same for ever. Through what invisible controul Thou rulest These willing waves, sublimer intellects Have found and taught; and veneration waits On their vast toils. But far-reached arguments Of densities, and gravitating powers, Mean distance—perigee, and apogee— Forewarned eclipses—total or in part— With each attraction, simple or combined, Were never meant for hold unscientific Of brain like mine; while lettered diagrams, And algebraic symbols, line or cross,— Strange as the shapes, which, in our Carib isle, Rude Obi-wizard scrawls on hut or tree, Or as demure astrologer erst traced On vellum, when he sold the stars for gold— These but perplex the more, like Cabala, Searing the sense. Enough for me to know, Through such chance-knowledge as mere hear-say brings, And faith, if uninquiring yet sincere, Enough for me to know, wide-ruling Moon! That thine it is to lead the foam-edged surges Along the shores; or up the sinuous harbour Where ships ride inland, lifting their tall masts Above the groves; or call them to the loch, Whose briny inlet, winding from the main, Tempts up the grampus 'mid the heathy hills. Enough for me to know that Thou, no less, Dost fill the curving horns of mightiest bay, Whose indrawn waters are themselves a sea, While kingdoms clasp it round. Or if I turn From lore of book or chart to watch the billows In-rolling from the deeps with joyous motion; And catch their thousand faces glistening up In thy clear light, and hear their thousand voices, Like a whole people's at a jubilee; Or if I see them, as I see them, now, Beneath this calmest sky as smoothly spread, And whitely, as an alabaster floor; No touch of cloud and not a murmur on them; E'en where they meet the shore scarce murmuring; As all reposing in thy clement ray, Yet ready to up-leap at thy least bidding; Beholding this, what needs more formal warrant From inky hand of gowned Philosophy To prove that Thou art in full right their Queen? And Queen Thou art in this thy realm of midnight, And lovely as Queen-like; yet not lovely less When Thou art lapsing on through either twilight, Companion of the Evening or the Dawn. For ever to the heart, which feeds on beauty, The Evening and the Morning make the day; Meridian Suns are mate-fellows of Earth, But Morn and musing Eve consort with Heaven. And ne'er did Dawn behold Thee lovelier yet, Than when we saw Thee, one remembered day, Thee and that brightest of all morning-stars, Hang o'er the Adrian; not in thy full lustre, But graceful with slim crescent; such as, erst, Some Arab chief beheld in his own sky Of purest, deepest azure; and so loved it, So loved it, that he chose it for his symbol; A peaceful symbol in a warlike banner! And oft, I ween, in many a distant camp, 'Mid the sharp neigh of steeds, and clash of cymbals, And jingle of the nodding Moorish bells, When he hath caught that image o'er the tents, Hath he bethought him of the placid hours When Thou wert whitening his night-feeding flocks On Yemen's happy hills; and then, perchance, Hath sighed to think of war! We too beheld Thee With untired eye fixed upward; scarce regarding (So deep the charm which Thou hadst wrapped around us) Where reddening lines along the Eastward Sea Spoke of the Sun's uprising. Up He rose, From o'er the regions of the near Illyria, Glorious, how glorious!—if less gladly hailed As warning thy departure. Yet, some time, Ye shone together; and we then might feel How they, the ancient masters of that land, The dwellers on the banks of Rubicon, Who saw what we were seeing, uninstruct' Of wiser faith, had, in no feigned devotion, Bowed down to Thee, their Dian, and to Him, Bright-haired Apollo! We too bowed our hearts, But in a purer worship, to the One, Who made, Alone, the hills and seas and skies, And Thee, fair Moon, the Hallower of them all! Well did that Sun fulfil his rising promise, Showering redundant light, the live-long day, O'er plain, and inland peak, and bluest sea; And brightening the far mole, which Old Ancona Hath reared upon the waves. Meanwhile thy form (Faint and more faint, and, if might be, more fair; And still, as near to lose Thee, loved the more) Thinned to unseen. But as some morning dream, Too sweet to part with, and which yet must fade At touch of light, will oft unconsciously Mix with the day, serener thoughts inweaving Than sun-beams bring; or as some melody, Closed on the ear, nor e'en by it remembered, Will still its silent agency prolong Upon the spirit, with a hoarded sweetness Tempering the after-mood; e'en so didst Thou Waft the bland influence of thy dawning presence Over the onward hours. Yet, Thou sphered Vestal! If mine it were to choose me when to bend Before thy high-hung lamp; and venerate Thy mysteries; and feel, not hear, the voice Of thy mute admonition; let it be At holy vesper-tide, when nature all Whispers of peace; if solemn less than night's, More soothing still. Such season of the Soul Obeys Thee best. For as the unwrinkled pool, Stilled o'er by stirless Eve, will dimple under The tiniest brushing of an insect's wing; So, at that hour, do human hearts respond To every touch of finer thought. Such eve, Such blessed eve was ours, when last we stood Beside the storied shore of Gaëta, Breathing its citroned air. Silence more strict Was never. The small wave, or ripple rather, Scarce lisping up the sand, crept to the ear Sole sound; nor did we break the calm with movement, Or sacrilege of word; but stayed in peace, Of Thee expectant. And what need had been Of voicèd language, when the silent eye, And silent pressure of each linkèd arm, Spokemore than utterance? Nay, whose tongue might tell What hues were garlanding the western sky To welcome thy approaching! Purple hues With orange wove, and many a floating flake Crimson or rose, with that last tender green Which best relieves thy beauty. Who may paint How glowed those hills, with depth of ruddy light Translucified, and half etherial made, For thy white feet to tread on? and, ere long— Ere yet those hues had left or sky or hill, One peak with pearling top confess'd thy Coming. There didst Thou pause awhile, as inly musing O'er realm so fair! And, first, thy rays fell partial On many a scattered object, here and there; Edging or tipping, with fantastic gleam, The sword-like aloe, or the tent-roofed pine, Or adding a yet paler pensiveness To the pale olive-tree; or, yet more near us, Were flickering back from wall reticulate' Of ruin old. But when that orb of Thine Had clomb to the mid-concave, then broad light Was flung around o'er all those girding cliffs, And groves, and villages, and fortress towers, And the far circle of that lake-like sea, Till the whole grew to one expanded sense Of peacefulness, one atmosphere of love, Where the Soul breathed as native, and mere Body Sublimed to Spirit. She, too, stood beside us, Our human type of Thee; the Pure, the Peaceful, The Gentle—potent in her gentleness! And, as she raised her eyes to thy meek glory, In the fond aspiration of a heart, Which prized all beauty and all sanctity; We saw, and loved to see, thy sainting ray Fall, as in fondness, on her upturned brow, Serene—like it. Alas! in how brief space Coldly to glitter on her marble tomb! She lies in her own land; far from the scene Of that fair eve; but Thou, its fairer part, Thou Moon! art here; and now we gaze on Thee To think on Her; if still in sorrow, yet Not without hope; and, for the time to come, Though dear to us thy light hath ever been, Shall love Thee yet the more for her sweet sake. Once more that tomb hath opened! and She, who, Companion of my wanderings as my life, Thus far had listened to th' unfinished strain, Shedding fond tears to hear a Sister's praise, Now lies in death beside her. Fare thee well, Thou faithful Heart! and Thou, dejected Song! For now thy spell is broken—fare thee well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRETENCE: A Satire. PART I.—TABLE-TALK. ARGUMENT NO WANT OF SUBJECTS FOR SATIRE. PRETENCE THE PECULIAR VICE OF THE PRESENT AGE. PRETENCE AND PRETENSION DISCRIMINATED—THEIR VARIOUS MODIFICATIONS AND AGENCIES—JOINT OR SEPARATE. CITY—PRIVATE AND COURTLY FRIENDSHIPS. COURTS OF LAW.—RURAL LIFE—EFFECTS OF PUBLICITY—STATESMEN—CHURCHMEN—CONCLUSI0N. A. —True! nor recant I—true! I did engage That e'en in this most seeming virtuous age, With no vast stretch, with no far-scenting wind, Fit game for Satire were not hard to find. Nay, would you question? let us cast around 'Mid our home walks, and loosely try the ground. If Folly fly, her flight is full in view; If Guilt have coverts, we may track them through. B. —Dost thou then doubt this matchless excellence, Our age's boast? A. —Nay, deem it—half—Pretence. Whether she flit through high judicial halls, Or snugly nestle in cathedral stalls; Whether to crowded mart she make resort; Or proudly perch in senate or at court; Or, reared remote, accomplish her desires 'Mid fields, the haunts of justices and squires; After long beat, by failure undeterred, I ne'er, at least, could flush this phoenix-bird. As fossil growths, yet not like ours, are found; As maladies through centuries run their round, (So saith the Leech, his cane beneath his chin,) And leprosies went out, when nerves came in; E'en so, I deem, some equal average Its good and ill metes out to every age; In each its own peculiar virtue flowers; Each grows its vicious weed; Pretence is Ours. To seem, not be, our ever-anxious aim, Such is our vice, beneath a double name; In turn by Folly nursed, and crafty Sense, And now Pretension called, and now Pretence. This seeks a vain display; this seeks to hide; And one from Interest springs, and one from Pride; Sometimes apart; more oft, in holy tether, Like sovereigns leagued, they rule and rob together. But oh! what type may paint each varying form, Shadow or light, the zephyr or the storm? Prompt as aërial clouds that drift and wreathe; Changeful of hue, as seas that roll beneath; They take all colours, turn at every call; Shift through a thousand shapes, and cheat in all. Blest are the brutes untaught! to Nature true, Their earliest instincts last their Being through; On man, scarce swaddled yet, grave teachers tend, Yet not a lesson holds him to the end. Mistaken mother! why, in gentle sooth, On us instil your cradle-creed of truth? Mere nursery tale; our after sole concern To live a lie, and all our lore unlearn. Oh Faith! with childhood thou art found alone, That ne'er suspects a guilt, except its own. With happy play tired out, it drops to bed, And leaves, sleep-seized, the little prayer unsaid; And this it is, full sure, the innocent sin, That, all next day, grieves its poor heart within; Its pretty self it scarce enough can chide, But dreams all good of all the world beside. And still, sweet child! from each misgiving free, Sport on 'mid snares, as yet no snares for thee; And love the fair-browed visions, while they last, And cling to Faith, which will but fleet too fast. The youth, who long hath trod with trusting feet, Starts from the flash which shows him life's deceit; Then, with slow footstep, ponders, undeceived, On all his heart, for many a year, believed; But hence he eyes the world with sharpened view, And learns, too soon, to separate false from true. Yet keenest searcher, though his lanthorn light, Veered sudden round, flash many a rogue to sight, Foiled, oftener still, by deep hypocrisies, Must ask, at length, not what each does, but is; With sadder, subtler wisdom learns to scan, And tests, more oft, the action by the man. Seen from new points what various comment bear In life, as landscape, shows of Dark or Fair! How misty motives hinder truth to spy! How deeds but flare to cheat the observer's eye! What searching sermon wrought that solemn turn In Aspro's faith? the man was always stern. Swerved to Rome's worship, what conviction strong Swayed Gusto? love for picture and for song. When Servio gave that vote for liberty, A place refused might hint the reason why. When Hirco raised yon Magdalen from the dust, Who doubts 'twas Charity that pimped to Lust? Or thin or deep, all tricked in some disguise; Discreet observance just what satisfies; Looks free, hearts closed; or but by license drawn, Like water, sentried in a garrison; We shift, with easy air, our things of dross, Counterfeit medals with a well-feigned gloss, While each receives the other's coin untold, And counters, by convention, pass for gold. To show—to hide—to seem what we are not. Some willing feigners—some constrained by lot— (For who would combat naked needs must fail, Where others sheathe in visor and in mail) Lo! here of half the virtues, which we count, The mighty secret, and the true amount. And feign they might, from my poor comment free, Myself to criticise enough for me, So each, snug nestled in his borrowed skin, Would cease to bawl for praise with sturdy din. But when, false claims not timorous to discuss, All clamour forth “For models look on Us,” Mere silent scorn no longer I may nurse, And honest indignation vents the verse. But come, if still conviction poise in doubt, And see if facts may bear our thesis out. Forth then we fare, and, no wide tract surveyed, Pause where the Lombards plied their ancient trade; Where still, 'mid tawny ledgers, loves to hold His daily watch the Sacred Thirst of Gold, And sniffs, by noon-lit lamp, in dusky lane, The rich, rank odours steamed around from gain. Yet these but breathe the city's morning air, No vesper-star must see Sir Balaam there, For Pride, long since, hath whispered in each ear, That gold, at such a rate, were bought too dear. Soon some vast tract reluctant Ceres yields, The lake is wound, and parked a hundred fields, And mansion huge, at Wealth's supreme command, Like snowy mountain, glistens o'er the land; And clump-encircled, and plantation-bound, Proud as its lord scorns all the country round; While each excess luxurious city loves Parades its pride, or riots, through the groves. There Taste, run mad, on high, like Muezzin, set, Shouts o'er the roof from many a minaret, Or shows, right happy, to the gaping clown The Moorish front, and pillars upside down. Antiques within—'tis so the broker calls— And varnished Raphaels, vouched originals; There books, unread, bedizened all and new, Flaunt in the gold their writers never knew; Puzzling the host, there sparkle hard-named wines, De Reyniere scarce might count the varying vines; And there, while flatterers swill in thirsty strife, Capricious smiles or frowns the haughty wife. Are these, grave Whittington, respected Shade! Are these thine ancient, simple sons of trade? B. —I grant 'tis luxury; yet the race who moil May rightly claim remission from their toil; And if excess unduly there be found, 'Tis but degree; and who shall fix the bound? A. —And so shall Satire graduate each offence, Nor treat Pretension as she treats Pretence; Shall merely smile to mark the smaller spot, But justly frowns indignant on the blot. She smiles when Balaam quits his old resort, And city-friends, to leave his card at court; And smiles to see the new-bought blazonry Far flaming from his chariot, flashing by. She frowns on knavish show, that yet awhile Tricks out some tottering credit, to beguile, Then bursts, at once, in ruin, wide and deep, Whence orphans pine and widowed mothers weep. She frowns on seals to broken contracts set, And the long file that glooms the last gazette, Which honest Gripus reads with clenching fist, Then sends his own pure name to swell the list. She frowns on hollow scheme, on puffed-up share, And that late gulf, fraud-scooped, in Gresham's square; Anno 1825. (The ravening Southsea flowed not more profound, A gulf, not greedier, cleft Rome's forum ground) Round which, in gamester strife, all England stood, City and court—and all for England's good! Nor closed we saw it, till those jaws between Pride, Conscience, Honour, all were tumbled in; All! for the chance some lucky hit affords To strut a Croesus and to herd with lords. “He who would taste of true felicity,” Quoth Martial, “let his friends his equals be;” “Pares Amici;” which Servilio hears, And inly renders, “let your friends be Peers.” Servilio—thus I mask a once-loved name— Be he our type; the race are all the same; With whom through childhood's trusting bowers I strayed; Conversed with school-boy earnestness or played; Our young affections wreathed in strictest twine; Of his love jealous; all his quarrels mine; And still we loved, as years familiar ran From childhood up to youth; from youth to man; Servilio scarcely knows my name of late; Servilio, now, may only know the Great. On a low pony asked, as suits, to ride, Him late I saw, with pity for his pride, Straining, in vain, behind the spanking blood, And happy to receive his Lordship's mud. For days his Grace's well-watched pathway trod, A bow perchance he wrests or wins a nod; Then, home returned, his own full pride he wakes, Bows, like the Duke; and gives the nod he takes. You meet Servilio with his only boy, A very dream of love! a living joy! “Why, 'tis a cherub every heart to stir, Your own sweet child?”—“Sir Simon's godchild, Sir.” Ignobly proud to tell the honour done, And happier in the sponsor than the son! Such are the tribe in Grandeur's skirts who nest, And soil, with reptile crawl, his crmined vest. Keep Us alike from cold and fawning friends; Where flattery begins, there friendship ends. Friendless the Great, whom friended most we call; A King—the most unfriended wretch of all! Where'er his palace-gate its front shall rear, Be graved thereon “No friendship enters here.” His easy days Charles Stuart—not the First— Best of companions, if of Kings the worst; Whiled gaily, with a witty, merry crew, Friends! nay, not courtiers—loving all and true! How true, how loving—tell that proving hour When Death shall lay his clay-cold hand on Power; Yea, even before hath ceased the death-bed knell, Let many a kingly couch, deserted, tell. The closing hour hath passed, which, soon or late, Must pass o'er all; a monarch lies in state; In lonely state; for Love hath gone, and Sorrow, To plan the crowning pageant for to-morrow. Now, let thy fancy pierce yon glimmering room, That coffin's only guard one sordid groom; Mark how, the prowling night-rat scarce forbid, The varlet snores beside the ready lid. And what his dreams? Are they of kingly fame, A weeping people, and a world's acclaim? Ah, no! he dreams of some contested grace, Trapping or plume, his perquisite of place; Mutters his greedy discontent, half loud, And gropes, with sleep-tied hand, to clutch the shroud! Yet, e'en for him, deserted thus who dies, Ere long shall statues gleam; shall columns rise; And epitaphs Servility shall bring; Who lauds dead Kingship, flatters living King. City and court found each so strictly true, Grave seats of Themis! turn we now to you. B. —Let Prudence prompt, and spare each learned hall. A. —If Prudence prompt, say rather, “Praise them all;” Thus, so we trust, the eulogistic rhyme May turn to profit in the fitting time, And haply, when we stand arrest to move, No Midas curl his brows, an adverse Jove. Begin the song! Pleas—Bench—whate'er the name, Crack the round globe, they stand in fearless fame! Truth's ancient ramparts, built to guard and stem, Pretence found never resting-place in them! There no convenient fictions lie for truth, But deed avowed is deed in very sooth! No merely formal there prevails o'er fact, But essence stamps its character on act! There too the Moral Sense, severely keen, A very prude, keeps trembling quarantine; Refuses still, indignantly sublime, Or shuddering takes her tainted fee from crime! And there, within should plague-spot chance to steal, Pure Spurcio sits to fumigate and heal! B. —Ironic thus your skin you scarce shall save; For—spite the opinion old Trebatius gave— Had these, our courts, tried Flaccus, much I doubt If even his wit had borne him harmless out. A. —The smoke, the riches and the strifes of Rome Right glad I quit; come, rural blisses! come. To sweet retreats, unostentatious bowers, We wend us now; to fields and farms and flowers! “God made the country and man made the town,” Or true or false, so Cowper wrote it down; And fields, I ween, might boast a purer race, Ere change of manners grew on change of place, While yet broad Trent and Cumbrian mountains bold Were real barriers, guarding habits old. Then if the goodman, or the goodinan's wife, Sighed sore to view the far-famed city's strife, Soon the rough waggon stage and quagmire road Stirred fond remembrance of the old abode. E'en when amid the mighty city set, E'en there they gazed, less wonder than regret; Till, back returning from the great event, Their life's one pride, they died—at home—content. For such dull bliss our age hath too much wit; Home, now, no resting-place, but place to quit. In endless change we live; in change we die; Found scarcely one, of all life's flitters by, The turf to tenant where his fathers lie. For ancient village lane, irriguous, deep, Through moss and wreathing roots that loved to creep; For church-way paths, through meadows wandering free; Sweet records of an old civility; By many a faded generation trod, Who simply sought their fathers' house of God, There, where it rose, with old grey tower serene, From forth the elm-trees on the village green, Ere town and country yet were clustered thick With trim new-fangled chapels of red brick; For these—fork forth new roads, like branching veins, And strong thro' each the living current strains, Till every pulse from fevered city's heart Fires with fierce throb the realm's extremest part. “When shall I see the country once again?” Thus sighed the Latian bard his ancient strain; But we—his sylvan longings should we share— Must ask not when we shall behold, but where. For now, as travels on mid wigwamed hills The civilizing power, that taints or kills, Along each British valley's sweet approach Whirls in the city with the whirling coach; Cigars and waltzes; latest caps; last news Of Crockford's—Almack's—justice-rooms and stews, And controversial preachers, and French shoes. Its vices roused, its roughness ill smoothed down, Each village now would ape the lordly town; “Rustic” mere term for what no longer is, And all the land one vast metropolis. Thou best companion of the wise and good, For so the wise have named thee, Solitude! If wise and good but co-exist with thee, Like Indian tribes, they soon must cease to be. For lo! Publicity with searching spell Hath pierced the shade of every household cell; The day's gazette her scroll of magic might, Within—without—she pours unnatural light; Bids the keen beam thro' cottage, palace—pass, And shows each tenant as in house of glass, Till, like sun-loving plants, life's general crew Lives but in one broad glare of public view. Scorning all bliss from home-bred duties wrought, And all just pride of individual thought, Distorted worth she gives, with twisting lens, To vulgar show and proudly-base expense. Scorning no less, so gaping crowds approve, “That perfect witness of all-judging Jove,” Which, fallen on evil days, and poor and blind, Its grand composure breathed o'er Milton's mind, She stamps, instead, on a theatric age The false and conscious movements of the stage, Till, perfect actors grown, men play life's part To the last scene with calculated art. Vexed by hypocrisies, or chafed by pride, “What walls shall guard us, or what shades shall hide?” Where'er we turn, for ever—ever nigh, Publicity pursues us as we fly; At every hour, in each remotest place Prescribes the phrase, or modifies the face; Of pettiest hamlet pettiest deed notes down, And makes the country fastuous as the town. So now, when rural squires would meet to dine, The county press must vaunt the vast design; E'en as when Muckworm his town-feast would blaze, Himself the paragraph both writes and pays. And not alone where roaring feast goes round, Is heard the pride-proclaiming trumpet's sound; On Charity, scarce charity if told, It waits, as 'mid the Pharisees of old; And if gorged wealth, with patronizing air, Buy some small pasteboard at a Serious Fair; Or keep his oldest friend, broke down and grey, Just one degree above mere parish pay, The ready newsman, on our modest plan, Makes known to Heaven “The Charitable Man.” So left hands learn each action of the right, And not a bushel now conceals a light. The Great themselves, who, from their loftier sky, Might view small glories with disdainful eye, The very Great themselves— B. —Nay, spare the Great, The world will swear, 'tis envy all or hate. A. —Yet falsely swear. Nor sect's nor party's slave, Each topic free to choose, or gay or grave; With equal friends, and peaceful daily bread, Me envy quits, to fret the Great instead. Nay, more! Each lingering glory fond to trace, The Muse hath ever loved an ancient race; Loved, where she might, to deck with sweetest rhyme Each precious relic of the olden time, And snatch and wreathe anew, with greenest bay, The fading chaplets Age would cast away; But when, as now, low-stooping to Pretence— B. —Was Walpole then such perfect innocence? A. —Yet, if Sir Robert knew each patriot's price, Pretence, at least, was not his age's vice. No idle blushes—no grimaces made— The account was rendered in, and Cato paid. If guileful they, yet ours the graver guile; We cheat with vows—they cheated with a smile. Yes! now—pretences—oaths—have current use To blanch the apostate's plea—the knave's excuse. Himself lynx-eyed, this finds a people's mind Besotted deep, and lends his blaze to blind. This vows reform; reform full deftly planned To hinder warmer heart and franker hand. “To shirk one's party” Gyro damns for sin, Nor “rats” from his, as long as they keep in. Old Syphax cries, “I hate a party's thrall,” And, pledged to none, receives his bribes from all. E'en loftiest natures, with ambition curst, Hard penalty! to lead must follow first; And when the rest, at length, the van concede, Keep the old track, and only just precede; On useful knavery hold the bridle slack, And, when seems useful, rein frank honour back; With falsehood, nay with treachery, oft must mate, And greatness lose, in striving to be great. Hence, if, at last, the struggling will thou bend, And stoop to herd awhile for worthiest end; Add thy proud venture to their vulgar wares, Nor scorn to let thy motives mix with theirs; Yet, in disgust, thou oft shalt quit the band, To take, like Abdiel, solitary stand; Or, held impracticable and high-flown, Left, if not leaving, find thyself alone. And what for him who leans on others' part, But disappointed hopes, and sickening heart! In freedom reared, for treachery deemed too young, A nation's hopes on high-born Cassius hung. When stormy senates raised the stern debate, Of power he seemed to save a sinking state; And many a bold, confiding heart, I wis, Had pledged its dearest, holiest hopes to his. Gods! how we felt, when, strong in honour's might, For England's fame he rose, for England's right; Hurled his proud threats, impeachment and disgrace; Flashed—flamed—then perorated—snug in place! Greatness is goodness, else not worth a pin; Mere talent's greatness stirs no chord within, But, like keen razor plied the surface o'er, Acts simply on the surface, and no more. Sick to the core of thin or deep Pretence, The attack, false-motived, or as false defence; Of furious partisan, and dirty job, And bribing candidate, and greedy mob; Sick of great names, wherewith all Europe rings, Of peoples sick, and ministers, and kings, In soul I turn to scenes beloved of yore, And fret for Greeks and Catholics no more. Granta! beneath whose mildly-cloistering bowers Swift years I passed, made up of idlest hours; Ere yet on hearts, in flowing frankness bold, Unfeeling Time had fixed his freezing hold; For still this praise be thine, gone spirit of youth! Thy very vices had their touch of truth— Granta! for thee though wreath I never won, Granta! receive again thy world-tired son; Pleased, as of old, by thy calm stream to stray, And where youth smoothly sped, dream age away. In vain! To college halls, to churchmen's bowers The feigning spirit pierces and o'erpowers; Gains on the vulgar thought, nay—finer sense, Watches his hour, and whispers the pretence. Rufus, the scape-grace of a public school, Focus of mischief! scorner of each rule! Not held quite “raff,” nor quite without a flaw, If tried by school-boy honour's nicer law, To Alma came; as if to show how place Could work no miracle; at least in grace. Still his old duns relate his every shift; Still proctors tell how wary or how swift; Boon friends—how very prone his clay to wet; While fellow-freshmen never can forget His strange good luck, or judgment in a bet; How oft he cleaned 'em out on Bibury course, And what a hand he was to sell a horse. E'en when the bishop's mild ordaining hand Had stricter rule imposed with gown and band, Our deacon yet of strictness little smacked, Nor made he vast pretence to what he lacked. But when his lot befell to settle down, A well-paid curate in a thriving town, Where mammon and devotion, each a pride, 'Twixt prayer and pelf th' ambitious crowd divide, To his clear interests never quite a dunce, A change came o'er the outward man at once. You know him, now, by somewhat straighter hair; And a strained look of sanctimonious care, Which, as must seem, no worldly thought distracts; And a huge quarto pocket, stuffed with tracts; And sermon sour; and week-day talk austere; Save when he holds some female follower's ear; Such gifts to rich preferment needs must come, Or win a trusting wife—with half a plum. But these—the coarser clays—the common strain! On gifted Hiero muse with deeper pain; Hiero—who poor beneath the tempting stole, Still proudly kept the freedom of his soul; Nor on another's mind could grant it good To screw the fetters which himself eschewed; Till placed, as chanced, a minister beside, Those vows he changed, and quelled that barren pride. The palinodia soon, in graceful sort, For this he meant it—kisses hands at court; “A charming candour” all the maids avow, And the meek mitre veils his blushing brow. Oh! ruined promise of a brighter hour! Oh! throb for honour, ill exchanged for power! So some sweet forest plant, born for the shade, To richer soil, or sunnier skies conveyed, Tho' there with stem to worthless stature grown, Offends with a coarse blossom—not its own. B. —If these be facts, or only talk severe, I stand in doubt, and interrupt you here; Yet frankly own, if half you say be true, Satire, e'en now, may find enough to do. A. —When least—then best. In my own doing's spite, Little love I the Satire which I write. Harsh drugs, tho' given but to drive ailments out, Will sometimes in the giver wake a doubt; And this the Satirist still must take in trust, E'en those hate him who own his Satire just.

Chased from yon spreading oak's serene alcove By modish nymph, our Dryad of the grove; But, luckier far than Horace in his walk, Escaped yon worldling's overweening talk; Peaceful with books, come, let this shrouding room Receive us to its window-tinted gloom; Such, Lambeth! as thy towers have harboured long, Like cowlèd monk amid the city's throng— Here, from intrusion free of pride or pelf, Here let us range, at will, each silent shelf; And, odours round while tattered bindings cast, Inhale the dying gales of centuries past. Lo! here around, the minds of every age, Pilgrim and bard, theologist and sage. Some forth have fared, to paint, with faithful pen, The modes and cities of far distant men; Some choose a quest, more deep, if more confined, And sound each process of the thinking mind; Or quit that more abstracted search, to sean Event or act of individual man; Or legends old, or languages explore, And guide from age to age, from lore to lore. These watch the eternal planets eyeling by, And win the wondrous wisdom of the sky; These sift each smallest growth of earth or air, And find, not less, ennobling knowledge there. Here too are they who own no single thrall, But catch, to re-transmit, the lights of all; Now, track the One intelligence and rule From system vast to tiniest molecule; And now a yet more blessed lore impart, And fix the principles, and mould the heart. How oft, at evening, when the mind, o'erwrought, Finds, in dim reverie, repose from thought, Just at that hour when soft subsiding day Slants on the glimmering shelves its latest ray; And pensive breeze, from dewy jessamin, Through open casement, scarcely felt, steals in,— Along those darkling files I ponder slow, And muse, how vast the debt to books we owe. Yes! friends they are! and friends thro' life to last! Hopes for the future! memories for the past! With them, no fear of leisure unemployed; Let come the leisure, they shall fill the void; With them, no dread of joys that fade from view; They stand beside us, and our youth renew; Telling fond tales of that exalted time, When lore was bliss, and power was in its prime. Come then, delicious converse still to hold, And still to teach, ye long-loved volumes old! Yet here commix, at will, the old and new, Grave first-editions and the last review. All sizes, as all ages, crowd the wall, Sermons from Oxford, pamphlets from Whitehall; Huge quarto tomes, that curve the groaning shelves, Sedate octavos; petit-maître twelves; Here thick black hides some ancient sage enfold; Here last year's witlings fade in green and gold. Yon folios, jerkined, clasped, in stout array, Were all renowned polemics in their day; Right fierce were they to argue or to rail, Nor boded once yon spider's dusky veil. But thou, polemic though thou wert, o'er thee, Thou mild as learned, mitred Jeremy! If ever that dark spinner chance to stray, With pious hand I brush the film away. More near, and often stirred with reverent hand, No cobwebbed race, immortal poets stand. Their leaves, by Time's own autumn tinted o'er, Come turn we now, and fondly taste their lore; With curious eye oft pausing to survey Where the shy worm hath worked his ancient way; And, undiverted then by fresh review, A hermit-student, went his volume through. Due honour to the stout-built Man of Prose! Reasoner on facts! who scorns to feel, but knows! Yet be it mine, who love not less the true, To lead, well-feigning bards! my hours with you; And sick, long since, of facts that falsify, And reasonings, that logically lie, With you live o'er my wisely-credulous youth, And in your fictions find life's only truth. And sweet 'twill be, or hope would so believe, When close round life its fading tints of eve, To turn again our earlier volumes o'er, And love them then, because we've loved before; And inly bless the waning hour that brings A will to lean once more on simple thi ngs. If this be weakness, welcome life's decline! If this be second childhood, be it mine! Yet to the radiance of new-risen mind Nor stupidly, nor insolently blind, And no mere praisers of departed hours, We hate no day, because more bright than ours. But, as the pilgrim, worn with toil or time, Will fondly hanker for his native clime, And wins, or hopes to win, reviving powers From first-loved fields and childhood's simple bowers, E'en so do we reclaim our youthful light, To us more mildly healing, if less bright. Who has not loved, erewhile, to pause and look On childhood's record in some old school-book, Name—or grim portrait scrawled in ink—agen Awakening memories, which had slept till then? What if the spirit shrink in sudden grief, When the eye lights on some remembered leaf, With parent, or beloved friend, once read, The, now, for-ever-parted—or the dead! Though for brief space the stroke be still severe, Not long we shun the line that wakes the tear, But, stealing back to that love-hallowed page, With its own balsam its own wound assuage. Digression o'er, turn once again to see These witnesses of many a century. Yes! ages—present—past—are mingling here; Yet, welcome elders! still to me most dear. As when along some gallery's pictured line Frown statesmen old, and modern beauties shine; Though Reynolds there bestow his breathing skill, Hard-featuring Holbein holds the fancy still. Now—doubly sweet such refuge found with books! To stray with mild Piscator up the brooks; With Cowley muse beneath the greenwood tree, Or taste old Fuller's wise simplicity. Or if his Worthies, though removed their span, Smack yet too strongly of the living man, Then backward turn to question Homer o'er, Or dream of storied ages, rolled before; Faint-glimmering now, like far-off beacon light O'er misty ocean scarcely read aright. But if, perplexed by history's fabling theme, Vexed thought would float entire on fancy's stream, To me more dear than all the East e'er gave, Those nightly tales, Arabia's gift, I crave: With Sinbad let me wander, sailor bold, And hear his mighty marvels, ten times told; Or read again of Morgiana, who The robber-chief with whirling dagger slew; Or, fondlier lingering, through charmed hours prolong “Of Thalaba the wild and wondrous song.” Thrice summoned, scarce I quit those Genii bowers, Most loved, as most unlike this world of ours. To us the mere material world is all; Our pride; our tax; our pleasure and our thrall. Science, whom scarce the circling spheres may fold, Chained to a desk we hire to scheme for gold; Drag from his heights Imagination down, To please, for daily bread, the modish town; And daintiest Art, the dreaming child of Grace, Wake from her dream to paint some idiot face. Virtue herself, born guest of Heaven's high roof, Gift of the Godhead; gift at once and proof; E'en Her, blind bigots of our planet birth, E'en Her, we fain would fetter down to earth; Just mark where Bat-Expedience flits at height, And meanly, there, would bound her eagle-flight. From such a world, all touch, all ear, all eye, What marvel, then, if proud Abstraction fly; Amid Hercynian shades pursue his theme, And leave the land of Locke to gold and steam? But thou art not of those who, hence and thence, Glean for low ends their pic-nie scraps of sense; A lofty thinker, proud thy thirst to slake At truth's well-head, unbribed, for truth's own sake; Or art thou of the race still more unfit To wrestle with the clans of worldly wit; One, whom ere yet thy youngling thought could reach To wield sweet verse, or e'en well-painting speech, Some unseen presence fed with many a dream Won from old bard, or caught from cloud or stream; And still, though turmoiled mid the things that are, Still dost thou love to muse on Good and Fair; And, faith outworking from far names sublime, The brethren-band of every age and clime, To thy young heart's first creed of virtue cling, Nor stoop to think her an unreal thing; Oh! prize those dreams, oh! guard that creed of thine; But guard it hid within thy bosom's shrine; To clasp, at silent eve, at unwatched morn, But let not garish day detect to scorn. And scorn it will. For, while on viewless wings Thou soarest 'mid thy high imaginings, The future, not the present, is thy lot; Thou livest in a world that knows thee not. Of this be warned; nor yet of this alone; Those who once loved shall mock thee or disown. Lo! one and all the former friendly band, Who stand in lofty place, or wish to stand, Look on, and “do confess they wonder much They e'er could hold companionship with such! 'Tis true, those dreams of Good, in earlier youth, Might wear—did wear—a sort of look of truth; But forty years should surely tame the brain, Such reveries at forty scarce are sane, And hurt one's fortune, when they last such while!” —Then hug they their own wisdom with a smile. “But books, thou say'st, shall shield thee; and when men Neglect or scorn, thou'lt turn to books agen; And, safe from all that slight and all that sneer, With truth and wisdom nurse high musings here.” And blest it were with them, if wise and true, Once more to live and candid youth renew; But truth and wisdom guide not every pen; In trust we flee to books, and find them—men. And here, e'en here, 'mid this conventual gloom, And sacred, as might seem, Pretence finds room, Mid ancient tomes niched in, and learned dust, To offend the moral or the taste disgust; And plies herself a hundred worldly ways For petty interest, or as petty praise. The sordid tribes who say and then unsay, And flatter or asperse, and each for pay, Of these, though here full rife, no talk we hold, But leave them—glad to leave them—to their gold. Mere pelf Furilio scorns, and burns for fame; But easier finds to filch than build a name; So picks and steals from authors little read, As birds of carrion banquet on the dead. Such rob in silence. Some, hard rogues, abuse The very victims they design to use. Some praise to steal; but cloak in such disguise, The stolen babe might cheat a mother's eyes. Thus Gulo, at a feast, tactician fine, Hints the fish stale on which he schemes to dine; Yon limner thus, with skill to understand, Views the great product of some master's hand; Extols each firmer touch, each finer trace, The strength of muscle and the turn of grace; Then to his task; where, if not line by line, He steals the spirit of the whole design. Changes perhaps a gesture, helm, or gown, For posture, arms, or drapery of his own; And having wrought a picture not amiss, Brings forth the pilfered piece and calls it his. And not Pretence alone, in borrowed dress, Pretension comes to taint these shelves no less, And, false to mere-affected softened down, Infects alike the laic and the gown; And, as herself more slender, wadded more, Struts in such robe as nature never wore; Whate'er the theme more pleased to seem than be, And verse and prose one wide hyperbole. Behold her there, where, scorning sponge or file, She o'erinforms yon bard's plethoric style; And with strange freight of similes, far sought, Cumbers all o'er his shallow waves of thought. 'Tis true, by fits e'en mighty Homer slept, Then from repose to freshened force up-leapt; But bard nor critic now give truce to vigour; Each syllable must strive; each word be figure. So fame is won. Nor only poet's rhyme Must feed on flowers and flutter in sublime; But, like false head that froths on sickly beer, When drugs belie sweet malt and hop austere, Church-briefs themselves with tropes are mantling o'er, And humble prose is humble prose no more. Yet strip, more oft, from each its fine brocade, How mean the mould of thought beneath displayed! Thus, posset-stirred, old January pranks In youthful hose too wide for shrunken shanks; Thus when, the booth without, some bumpkin's eye Hath fed on pictured monster, ten feet high, Giant or huge Bonassus, from his lair Hurling at once three hunters high in air, Let in, his visage takes most rueful touch, To find that In and Out unlike so much. From them—the grandiose or superfine, In various guise who travesty the Nine; And them, who thus in petty pilferings deal, And them, yet more, who slander while they steal; But most from such as serve men's hates for hire, And burn with coals from off the Muse's fire, Oft would I flee, beyond all printing's reach, Back to the golden days of simple speech, When yet of Press no prophecy could wot, And e'en preserving Manuscript was not. Oh! blessed days, too blest again to see, Alike from authors and from critics free. Then talk to simple topics was addrest; Who best dispatched the boar, or cooked him best; Which fur was found the warmest, wolf's or bear's; If turf or clay best fenced from wintry airs; Who foremost his bold spear in battle bore, Or dared his vessel farthest from the shore. Then none sat, chair-bound, forced to hear or say Of this man's sermon, or of that man's play; Nor inly yawned, while evenings ran to waste In wise discourse on learning or on taste. Then, too, no promised guest, engaged to dine With scribbler-host, so tempted by his wine, Was bound, as now, in rueful compliment, To read that host's dull book before he went. Yet minds were then, as now, with fruitage fraught, And wit could point his jest, while wisdom thought; And each passed current, for delight or law, In gay allusion or the solid saw. Yet whoso thus aspired to please or teach Was strained to hang his fame on passing speech; Such transient fame as living breaths afford; A fleeting glory from a winged word! So sped the unwriting age. Came Cadmus then, To leave in doubt if worse his lettered pen, Or serpents' teeth that grew to armèd men. For smothered hates could now find seemlier vent, And stab with peaceful-looking instrument. Yet Wit and Wisdom hence advantage gained; Their Spoken would have flown; their Writ remained; And them the pen most served, if not alone; —As gems we set, but slight the meaner stone. Nay, when, as chance it would, the hungry scribe Was won to toil for Folly's tempting bribe, The ephemeral birth just fluttered, and was gone; Bavius soon passed, while Maro still lived on. The great Emathian conqu'ror bade infold Iliad and Odyssee in cist of gold! Nor less did every age, in safest crypt, Strive to preserve the darling manuscript. But when the wild barbarians, horde on horde, Surged on, and letters died beneath the sword; Then every secret nook, designed to save The fondly-reverenced scroll, became its grave, Where lost it lay, through mouldering years of gloom, Like mummy-king, forgotten in his tomb. Princely Lorenzo, who not scorned the gown, But wreathed the scholar's with the statesman's crown, With generous quest explored them, where they lay, And gave each glorious vellum back to day. They came, like heralds from some far-off clime Of ancient fame, ambassadors from Time; And who but burned to unseal their trusted lore, And turn the high dispatches o'er and o'er? Nay, then, 'twas held no scorn to copy out, And pause, and pore, till texts were free from doubt; Genius himself on such slow task might moil; Where great the End, ne'er vulgar is the Toil. Oh matchless line of years, whose generous strife Reared man's reviving mind to perfect life. Then Petrarch's native lay refined on love; Then Angelo the' impetuous chisel drove; Then Oracles, that stirred young Raphael's breast, Spoke forth in colours, clear as words, exprest; And Learning, made no coldly gainful art, Was Sacrifice, and offered from the heart. When first, our questing age to scourge or bless, Ingenious Faust had framed the wondrous press, And taught to each, intent on good or ill, To waft on volant leaf the thought at will, Along the skies what dubious omen sailed, What prophecy or greeted, or bewailed? Or who might guess from whence the power was given, Upsent—from hell—to tempt, or dropt—in love—from heaven? Come back, long-toiling Faust! come back and see The produce of thy Good-and-Evil tree; Count o'er its mingled fruits of joy and pain, Then say if thou wouldst plant it o'er again! Thou too, wise Caliph Omar! who art said All Alexandria's ovens to have fed, Visit our shelves once more. Where'er we look Pamphlet on pamphlet, book buds out on book; Turn wheresoe'er we will, new volumes sprout; Some of fair promise; most lack clearing out. Come, then, thou Critic-Caliph—come again, Nor decimate; but take the nine in ten! B. —The ground thus cleared, you plant your own instead, And shrewdly gain one chance of being read.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS VERSES. LOVE. “Mother! I've seen a little boy With curling locks and eyes of blue; They seemed the very eyes for joy, Though wet with tears like morning dew. “His shoulders half with wings were hid, For play-things he had bow and quiver; And while he sued, as sue he did, His tears came gushing like a river. “And sighed, one's very soul to wring, Soothing the while a prisoned dove; Yet still that wild ungrateful thing Strove to be free, but vainly strove. “So soft he sued, he couldn't fail; I listened, till my heart was aching, And He, the while he told his tale, He sobbed as if his own were breaking.” “Oh Nea! be not thou beguiled By all his tears and all his sueing; Learn, silly girl! that weeping child, That weeping child is our undoing. “He'll win thee with his urchin sigh, Then work thee woe, and laugh for joy; While thou shalt stand in anguish by, All vain to melt that laughing boy. “Then when again the sprite you see, You'll tell him by his prisoned dove— Run—shut the door—turn quick the key— You know not what a boy is Love.” THE BROKEN APPOINTMENT. I sought at morn the beechen bower. Thy verdant grot; It came—it went—the promised hour— I found thee not. Light Zephyrs from the quivering boughs Soon brushed the transient dew; Then first I feared that Love's own vows Were transient too! At eve I sought the well known stream Where, wont to rove, We breathed so oft, by twilight gleam, Our vows of love; I stopped upon the pleasant brink, And saw the wave glide past; Ah me! I could not help but think Love glides as fast. Then all along the moonlight glen, So soft—so fair— I sought thy truant steps agen— Thou wert not there. The clouds held on their busy way Athwart the waning Moon; And such, I said, Love's fitful ray, And wanes as soon. Oh! I had culled for thee a wreath Of blossoms rare; But now each flowret droops beneath The chill night-air. 'Tis past—long past—our latest hour, And yet thou art not nigh; Oh! Love, thou art indeed a flower Born but to die! THE SURPRISE. TO? I marked her grave and nun-like air, When all beside were gay and free; And true, I said, the face is fair, But that was ne'er enough for me. And Her's, I grant, are speaking eyes, And Her's is brow of thoughtful mould; but these will never win the wise, When linked with heart too calm and cold. For me, a frost so chill and deep, I cannot tarry for its breaking; These sleeping Beauties—let 'em sleep, I never knew one worth the waking. And so I talked—till—on a day— Lured by I know not what vagary, She put such store of charms in play. Such frolic graces, smiles so airy; With cadences like music strung, And sense with feeling so commingling, That I though staid, and not too young, Felt, like the rest, my bosom tingling. A foolish tingling—yet so dear, An idle—yet so sweet a pain, I knew not if to wish, or fear That she were calm and cold again. BLUSHING TO? Chloris! I cannot help but blush To meet that dark and glancing eye; Sportive you mark the sudden flush, Then feign surprise and wonder why. Oh! have you seen the frozen stream, That wakes beneath the sunny ray? It dances in the genial beam, It leaps to feel the touch of May. Or have you viewed, with young surprise, The tube that tells of heat or rain. And watched tlie sparkling fluid rise, And throb along the crystal vein? Thus, Chloris! when thy dark eyes speak, Quickened by them the blood will start; Swift speeds the current to my cheek, But has its fount within my heart. THE MOORLAND GIRL. TO? True! She had been in city gay, And seen whate'er its pomps could show To win her youthful heart away, The courtly ball, the fluttering beau. And She hath form and face as fair As sculpture asks or painting wills; Yet, spite of all that flattered there, Her heart was 'mid her native hills. Once more, amid those native hills, A moorland girl, behold her bound, While all her heart with pleasure fills At rural sight, or rural sound; Whether She lift her eye to note The kite, high circling on the gale, Or pause to catch the tones that float From hidden cushat down the dale. Or if She climb the mountain side To pluck her favorite heath again, Or down the alder-valley glide, Or linger in the fir-tree glen, In bliss—the haunts of pomp and pelf May never know—each moment wheels, While sisters, spirits like herself, Share and enhance the bliss She feels. Sweet bud of beauty! moorland girl! Still, still hold on thy dream-like race, Far from the city's heartless whirl, And all the tribes of common-place: Still mould thine own wild paradise, Enjoying—living—loving thus— And wheresoe'er thy presence is, Shall still be paradise to Us. 1821 CHAMPAGNE ROSE. Lily on liquid roses floating— So floats yon foam o'er pink champagne— Fain would I join such pleasant boating, And prove that ruby main, And float away on wine! Those seas are dangerous, greybeards swear— Whose sea-beach is the goblet's brim; And true it is—they drown old Care, But what care we for him, So we but float on wine! And true it is—they cross in pain, Who sober cross the Stygian ferry; But only make our Styx—champagne, And we shall cross right merry, Floating away on wine! Old Charon's self shall make him mellow, Then gaily row his boat from shore; While we, and every jovial fellow, Hear—unconcerned—the oar, That dips itself in wine! 1837 CHAMPAGNE ROSE. Praise who will the duller liquor Juice of Portugal or Spain; Fill for me with lighter—quicker— Fill for me with Rose Champagne. See the glass its foam upgiving, Creaming—beading—round the brim, Such, were old Anacreon living, Such should be the wine for him! Elixir blest! Bacchus and Flora, 'Twas He proposed—She smiled compliance— Thee—a spell for mortal sorrow, Thee devised in gay alliance. Full of the plan, they leapt delighted From leafy couch, where each reposes, And while they plied their task united, (One gave the grapes, and one the roses.) Young Love stood near, with curious eye, And heedful watched the chemic union, And smiled to think how, by and bye, The play of looks, the soul's communion, And the tied tongue's first liberty Should thrive beneath that magic essence. And what, thou glorious alchemy! What though thy primal effervescence, Like Love's, too bright—too dear to stay— Like Love's—die almost in the tasting— Yet each I snatch, as best I may; Ah! why are both so little lasting. 1818 TO ECHO. Why, jeering Echo! thus renew my pain, And give me mine own sorrows back again? Speak but to those who hail thee and rejoice, Nor render grief's involuntary voice. If to these rocks in plaintive mood I come, In trust I came, for I believed them dumb; And if one name I spoke in trust too free, To Silence it was spoken—not to Thee. EPITAPH. Riches I had! they faded from my view— And troops of friends! but they deceived me too— And fame! it came and went—a very breath; While faith stood firm, and soothed the hour of death. EPITAPH FOR A ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCHYARD. Weary centinel of earth, Grief's companion from my birth, Doomed no more to watch and weep, Now I sleep the dreamless sleep In this calmly shrouding cell; But what the waking—who may tell! In that fated hour of fear, Mary! Mother! be thou here. Fear to sooth and hope to shed, Bend thee o'er this earthy bed; And let my waking view thee mild As mother o'er her wakening child. A FRAGMENT. TO? Dear H?, it was you who laid it down That up to Christmas we've no fogs in town; And then you asked me, as I well remember, What can the country offer in November? To which I answer: prospects, ne'er more fair, Stream, wood and valley, seen through smokeless air; And moon, where'er she ranges, viewed at will, Or if chance-hidden, not by house—but hill; And every star, for love on one to fix; And deep, rich sunsets, between five and six, That most convenient hour, just ere we dine, And no bad prelude to wood fires and wine; And trees, some stripped and some with lingering hues, From which, at will, our moral we may choose; And fifty things beside, that joy impart To the quick fancy or the thoughtful heart. E'en now I stood by a clear river's brim, And saw red leaves like golden fishes swim— THE TRAVELLED OYSTER. An oyster, upon oozy bed, Like his forefathers, born and bred, It chanced, was wafted far and wide By force of wind and force of tide; Nor are there wanting folk to say He drifted fairly round the bay. At last he drifted back agen; The very finest one might ken Of travelled oyster-gentlemen. For, though ne'er out of his own shell, He saw, or thought he saw, as well, And was, or deemed himself, as wise As fishes who use fins and eyes. In secret news he yields to none; Knows all the deeds by muscles done; 'Mong limpets what dark plots are hatching, What territory prawns are snatching; And has—from information—glimpse Of coming war among the shrimps. On all who hap within his reach, (For 'tis his darling pride to teach) He rolls that tongue which none may quell; While every brother of the shell Is sadly bound to stand the shock, Chained, like Prometheus, to his rock. And, Reader! we have seen, I wis, Full many a dull-brained fish like this, Who, having drifted Europe round, Floats back at last to his old ground; And though, like oyster, shut within His sulky shell, he nought hath seen, Yet still, in right of foreign travel, Assumes to talk—instruct and cavil. Speak of a church—he quotes Saint Peter's; A watch—he cites Breguet's repeaters; And e'en the trout, on which we dine, Would have been better from the Rhine; While we, chair-bound and wretched quite, Are forced to feign a mien polite. Good Reader! were it ours to choose, Such ne'er should quit their native ooze; Or ne'er, at least, should hit the track Which brings them, for our torture, back. ATTICA MELLA. The bees, Sir, wont sting you; then why this ado? And for honey—they'll never make honey of you— They're too wise to select such a flavourless fellow; At least—if intent upon Attica mella. ALMANAC DES BERGERS—1591. Pocula Janus amat—et Febrius, algeo clamat;— Martius arva colit—Aprilis florida prodit— Ros et flos nemorum Maio sunt fames amorum— Dat Junius foena—Julio resecatur avena— Augustus spicas—September colligit uvas— Seminat October—spoliat virgulta November— Quærit habere cibum porcum mactando December. TRANSLATION. January drinketh deep—quoth Feb'rary, “I'm cold”— March guideth ploughshare—April doth his struggling buds unfold— May sprinkleth flower and leaf with dew, and maketh lover bold. June sporteth 'mid his haymeads sweet—Oats fall in July-weather— August the ripened sheaves doth set—September grapes doth gather— October soweth future store—November strippeth twig— December—he rejoiceth him to kill his Christmas-pig. Marseille, Dec. 1829. LINES FOR A SCRAP-BOOK, IN WHICH THE WORD FINIS WAS PAINTED IN ROSES. Gay register of harmless mirth, Record of dear domestic hours; The votive hand, which gave thee birth, Now wreathes thy parting page with flowers. Such mirth is reason's—virtue's treasure— And they who, ere life's scrap-book closes, Have filled the leaves with guiltless pleasure, Shall find the Finis wrought in roses. LINES, WRITTEN IN THE TRAVELLERS' BOOK AT AN INN IN SWITZERLAND. From East and West, and North and South, What shoals are here! they go—they come— Yet, take whatever road they will, Not one but leads them to the tomb. They stop—step in—just scrawl their names— Then off they hurry, out of breath; Yet not a hand is busy here, But writes a register for death. INSCRIPTION FOR A VASE Belonging to my late friend, Thomas Poole, Esq., and which enclosed a lock of Washington's hair.. In elder Greece, where fostering liberty Nursed kindling Genius to adventure high, Some master-hand achieved this urn of grace, Within whose storied orb we fondly place One precious ringlet from the sacred head Of him, to more than Grecian virtue bred, Who for his struggling country freedom won, Heroic, self-controlling Washington! Stranger! doth charm of art thy soul inspire, Yet more, doth freedom's flame thy bosom fire? Then own that votary's hand did ne'er consign A dearer relic to a worthier shrine. Nether Stowey, 1819. ALBUM VERSES. LINES FOR THE LATE CAROLINE K.'S ALBUM. Like thine own Album, which lies here before me, Life is a volume. Sweetly some are writ In sanctity; as when mild Guido's pencil Portrays some Sybil-saint—her eye upturned On Seraph-teacher—with whose word her pen Moves in accord. All such with record stored Of heavenward aspirations, and, not less, Of earthly loves and charities—as holy— Each stain—if stain there be from the world's handling— Cleansed from their pages, shall librarian Spirits Hang on celestial shelves; thence oft perused By higher natures, not unpleased to learn Of this our nether sphere. Beloved friend! Who for thyself still doubtest—still the more For those meek doubts—Thy volume shall be there. FOR THE SISTERS' ALBUM Soft lays, that dwell on lips and eyes. Long since with me have had their day; At fifty, hearts grow cold or wise; This book receives a graver lay. Ill suits with would-be-youthful rhyme Clogged ink, for keeping all the worse; Come, halting pen! grown stiff by time, And limp admonitory verse. Should he, who fawningly deceives, His flatteries here be fain to write, Then, budding volume! close thy leaves, Like flowers, that shut them from the night. Not wholesome every breeze that sighs; And they who tend thee, Sister-pair, Shall guard thy blossom from surprise Of vulgar touch or baleful air. E'en wit, too reckless in his game, Might fray thy bloom; but biting sneer, Though dignified with satire's name, Let him not bring his canker here. But here would open-hearted love, Or friendship here inscribe his strain, Then, gentle book! each fear remove, And bid thy leaves expand again. Nor needs it second-sighted eyes, To know that both shall hither come, (Sly love perchance in friendship's guise) And join to feed the flow'ret's bloom. But oh! if She, the matron Muse, The loving Mother and the dear, Some lay of her's should interfuse, As sunny dew-drop bright and clear; Then, Flower of Albums! clasp the gem She hangs amid thy leaves; and tower, With freshened hues and straighter stem, A happy—fond—rejoicing flower. TO LOUISA C?, FOR HER ALBUM. Life is an Album; and my free Imagination loves to look And read, with happy augury, Thy life's as yet scarce opened book. And well begins that volume fair; And ever, onward as it goes, May Feeling write high lyrics there, And Sense inscribe his sober prose. And on the living vellum pure Be gifts from Hope and Memory met; From Memory, picture sweetly sure— From Hope, her fanciful vignette. The breathing book may many a friend Flock round with love that needs no call; But fondliest o'er its records bend Sweet home-affections—best of all. So if on Time's advancing tome— Far be the day—some creeping grief Must, like the treacherous book-worm come, To spot, perchance, or pierce a leaf; If such intruder there, as here, Should threat some lines 'twixt youth and age, Those household Loves shall still be near To chase the spoiler from the page. And thus, in kindly pleasures past, With conscience that of nought repents, Thy volumed years shall show at last, A blessed table of contents. FOR THE SAME BOOK. With all its best of sense and wit Each Album's earlier leaves are writ; No page—but Love and Friendship on it Shower dainty prose and perfumed sonnet; While not one troubling thought comes nigh Of future dearth and vacancy. Yet blight, e'en now, is on the wing To nip that vernal blossoming; His tribute flowers Wit fails to yield, Sense, worldly grown, seeks wider field; E'en Love and Friendship cease to write, And half the book is idle white. Turn, Emblem-seeker, turn and look, Thou'lt find a moral in the book. Though young, its lot may soon be thine; Searce old, long since I've found it mine. Youth's early loves, like vapour, fled; Its friendships—with the cold—the dead,— The lofty hopes by manhood cherished In disappointment plunged and perished; Year after year they struggled—sank— Then left my life this Album's blank. TO MARY ANNING Miss Anning, of Lyme Regis, is advantageously known as the earliest and most skilful explorer of the Saurian, and other fossil remains, in that neighbourhood. The most eminent geologists have been forward to attest the value of her discoveries. Those who know her personally, will be no less eager to bear testimony to her kindly temper, her straightforward character, and her fresh and strong intellect. The first line alludes to her having been struck senseless by lightning when a child. She was restored with difficulty; but the nurse, in whose arms she was, and two other females, were killed outright by the same flash.. Thee, Mary! first 'twas lightning struck, And then a water-vat half drowned; But I can't think 'twas mere blind luck Twice left for dead—twice brought thee round. No! Fortune in her prescient mood, I must believe, e'en then was planning To fabricate a something good Of Thee, the twice-saved Mary Anning. This to fulfil she did not bid Thy feet o'er foreign soils to roam, For well she knew what powers lay hid In these blue cliffs that touched thy home. And hither led, in vain to Thee Or marle, or rock, was insight banning; Some folk can through a millstone see; And so, in sooth, can Mary Anning. Mere child as yet, this sea-beat strand 'Twas thine to wander all alone, Upgathering in thy little hand Chance-pebble bright, or fossil bone. Though keenest winds were whistling round, Though hottest suns thy cheek were tanning, Nor suns, nor winds could check or bound The duteous toils of Mary Anning. At first these relic-shrouding rocks Were but thy simple stock in trade, Wherewith, through pain, and worldly shocks, A widowed mother's lot to aid. But now, with taught and teaching eye, Thy practised sense their sense is scanning; And learning and philosophy Both own their debt to Mary Anning. E'en poets shall by Thee set store; For wonders feed the poet's wish; And is their mermaid wondrous more Than thy half-lizard and half-fish? And therefore 'tis that, all the time Yon shark's head Thou art measuring, spanning, I inly weave this uncouth rhyme In honest praise of Mary Anning. True, Mary! we—earth-born—must go, Like these lost tribes, to earth again, While Lyme's dark-headed urchins grow, Each in his turn, to grey-haired men. Yet when, grown old, this beach they walk, Some pensive breeze their gray locks fanning, Their sons shall love to hear them talk Of many a feat of Mary Anning. HAPPINESS. “To be happy, we must not only forbear to anticipate the future, but must teach ourselves to forget the past.” Remark of a Female Friend. A face I saw, whose outward calm All inward peace might well express; And whose, I asked, that brow of balm? Her name, they said, was Happiness. And what those fillet-bands, I cried, The which in either hand she bears? Just such round Cupid's eyes are tied, And such eternal Justice wears. “Wouldst Thou be happy,” 'twas replied, “O'er coming hours must one be cast; And one (I knew the truth, and sighed) Must shroud the memory of the past.” 1837 TO ISAAC WALTON. Walton! dear Angler! when, a school-freed boy, Of varnished rod and silken tackle proud, I sought the brooks, or by some still deep pool, Still, or stirred only by the gentle west— Lay stretched at noon, and watched my trembling float, Thou wert my sole companion; and I conned, Studious, thy varied precepts o'er and o'er. And though, since then, full many a taste be changed, And me the fisher's simple sport no more Wins from light sleep, ere yet the streaky dawn Hath tinged the steaming wave with yellow light; Nor keeps me lingering on the grassy brink, Till sober night be fallen, and all lies hushed Beneath the silent moon; save—only heard— The stream's faint ripple, and the leaping trout. By fits upflashing in the silvery beam, Startling the general pause, then pressing it, Thus interrupted, deeper on the heart; Yet still, old man! I love the soothing power Thy rural landscapes breathe, like vernal breeze, Freshening the soul; I love thy pastoral songs, Those simple chauntings of the elder time, Thy contemplative vein, thy sweet content, And e'en thine antique phrase hath charms for me. And long as woods and skies and watered shores, And spring's and summer's change and changeful hours, Have power for pleasure—thou shalt please me still. E'en now, when winter locks the still deep lake In fastest frost, and stately-winding streams Rest motionless, and prattling brooks are mute; By my warm hearth, at evening's thoughtful hour, I love to sit and turn thy charmèd page, Till, answering to the gentle sorcery, Fair images and thoughts, that slumbered long, Of parted years awake; and, memory-led, Once more I seem to tread the banks of Dove, Those verdant banks—and list his water's flow, And catch his eddies, glittering in the sun; Breathing the freshness of a second spring, While all my boyish days revive again. WRITTEN AT SCHWYTZ. 'Twas not satiety—disgust— That led a wanderer forth to roam, To look for hearts of firmer trust, Or brighter eyes—thus far from home; 'Twas not for honour's prouder beat, 'Twas not for morals' chaster strain, Nor law, that sways from holier seat, With steadier hand or lighter rein; Oh! not for these, dear English land, He left thy billow-beaten shore; And absence to that rocky strand But binds his heart-strings more and more. But art Thou one to crouch thy back Compelled beneath a despot's frown, Where threat the impaler and the rack Beside the crosier and the crown; If nourished high with ancient lore Thy generous heart be sunk to groan, And but in dreams to ponder o'er The freedom Thou wouldst die to own; Then, pensive traveller! rest thee here; Let happier thoughts thy soul employ; Rest by these hearths to freemen dear, And give thy heart one pause of joy. SONG OF THE MANES Translated from some modern Latin verses in Benjamin de Constant's “Traité de la Religion,” vol. iii, p. 391.. Come, dance we now in friendly band; The Manes twinkling Hesperus calls; Cynthia through heaven a trembling light Shoots from her silver horns. None, blushing for his own poor grave, Craves—here—another's lordlier tomb; All equalized, at last, by Death, Who mocks our human pride. Yet we too have our stars, though not Lovely as earth's; our zephyrs we, If scarce like spring's; some lighter airs, And many a cypress grove. Manes, belov'd! whose debt is paid, Yet, as we dance, still scatter flowers, Though of dim hue; and lilies shed, If dusky—grateful still. How apt our feet! This springy turf No plod of heavy business knows; As deftly, weightless, bodiless, We wingèd shadows play! Thrice sinks our song to silence down; Thrice turn we to the Elysian pole; And thrice athwart the waste of night Bid our wan torches gleam. Thou who shalt see, forbear to blame! Songs shalt thou chaunt, ere long, like ours; Like thee—were we; like us—be thou; So follow—and farewell! REVERIE. Oh! blest it is by blazing hearth, With many a well-loved friend beside, And harp, and wine, and graceful mirth, To mock December's stormy pride. And blest it is, by studious light, The gusty wind unheard the while, To cheat the fast-receding night With poet's song or sage's toil. But I not less the hour may prize “When glowing embers thro' the room,” And fitful flame that flaps and dies, “Teach light to counterfeit a gloom.” For then I sit and dream again, The visions of departed years; A winding road of joy and pain, A varied view of smiles and tears. I think on days of youthful trust; On Love's and Friendship's changeful will; On some—estranged, and some—in dust; And one or two that love me still. Then, if the bitter with the sweet, Too deeply mixed, bid Memory groan, Yet Fancy lends her dear deceit To mould a future all my own. I cull from forth her boundless scope Whate'er of beautiful or rare Had ever fed my youthful hope, And build me fairy domes in air. While floating up bright forms ideal, Mistress, or friend, around me stream; Half sense-supplied, and half unreal, Like music mingling with a dream. Yet, firm as faith of young romance, These weave their spell within my breast; Till, buried in delicious trance, 'Twixt truth and falsehood I am blest. And hence it is the hour I prize, “When glowing embers thro' the room,” And fitful flame that flaps and dies, “Teach light to counterfeit a gloom.” THE JOY OF GRIEF. “In vain you touch that answering wire, Attuned to softest notes of peace; Not all the soothings of the lyre Can bid a father's anguish cease. The pang which youth's wild bosom wrings, The deeper woe of manhood's stage May melt before the breathing strings, But not the settled griefs of age. “I too those strings once loved full well, When woke a daughter's hand the measure, And love and music joined the spell, That made each note a thrill of pleasure. Hope too stood by, and every sound With omen bland interpreted; But Hope is now with cypress crowned, And ear and heart alike are dead.” “Oh slight not so the minstrel's strain, Nor all his precious power forego, Though now each varying cadence pain A heart that bleeds with recent woe. If oft thy suns in grief have set, If still thy skies may seem o'ercast, These chords can sooth the present yet, And pluck its bitter from the past. “Through all thy soul their calm shall creep, Like friendship's sympathizing tone, And, lulling sadder thoughts to sleep, To tender memories wake alone; And, sweet as sweetest eloquence Of bard or sage, shall breathe relief; And win thee, through thy charmèd sense, To own at length the Joy of Grief.” WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD At Broomfield, Somerset, the residence of my distinguished friend, Andrew Crosse, Esq.. Oh! how I hate the cumbrous pride Of plume and pall and scutcheon'd hearse, And all the rank and ready tide Of venal prose and lying verse. Nor in the city's churchyard, rife With close compacted crowds of dead, And clogged with thoughts of stir and strife, Would I consent to lay my head: But where 'mid Quantock's waving scene Of brow and glen, some village church From forth the coppice clustering green Projects its grey and simple porch; From whose worn seat the eye may view Brown upland slope and cattled plain, And, farther still, the summits blue Of hills that skirt the channell'd main; There, Nea, in some quiet nook, May we our place of resting have, And let a broad majestic oak Wave its green branches near the grave. No costly stone for us be planned With palisading stern and high, As if from truth's indignant hand To fence foul flattery's graven lie; But o'er the turf let sun and air And dew their blessed influence fling, And rosy children gather there The earliest violets of the spring; There let the cuckoo's oft-told tale Be heard at flush of morning light; And there the pensive nightingale Chaunt requiem half the summer night. THE NEGLECTED WIFE. “Revere, thou wedded Fair, thyself—thy vow, Though brutal wrongs thy faith—thy fondness wound; The still small voice within, that whispers now, Shall o'er thy dying pillow rapture sound.” Smyth's English Lyrics. They tell me that my face is fair, That sunny smiles are on my cheek— Yet sorrow hath been busy there, For many a day—for many a week— And struggling thoughts I may not speak; And keen regrets, both deep and keen; And what if smiles the surface streak, All cheerless are the depths within! My marriage troth I gave—received— While friends stood by with joy elate, And said, what my fond heart believed, That mine should be a blest estate. Ah! better than such wedding-fête, Ah! better than such bridal bed, The long-drawn funeral's plumy state, The winding-sheet that wraps the dead. For I full many a dream had wove, Such dreams as cheat the hopes of youth, Of meeting souls, that meet to love, Unchanging love! undying truth! What have I reap'd? the rankling tooth Of jealousy—His broken vow! Dreams that ye were, in bitter sooth, Deceitful dreams! I know ye now. My faith—my fondness set at nought, The civil taunt, or insult rude, The desert heart, where hope is not, And weeks and months of solitude, Are these indeed love's proper food? And still rejected or forlorn, Still must I quell my boiling blood, And crouch me to neglect or scorn? He too—the plighted object—He— Fond dream of many a shaping mood, Whom young creative fantasy With each romantic gift endued, Was it for this he came and wooed? Sent by what minister of wrath, In very form of fair and good— To mock my faith—to blight my path? To blight my path! One path there is, I know—for feet by travel torn, Which leads to smoother world than this, And where the wretched cease to mourn. Oh! teach, kind Heaven! a heart forlorn To make that path its hope most dear— Or else all vainly I was born, For I have nought but sorrow here. MUSIC. Awake, thou Harp! with music stored, Awake! and let me feel thy power; Fling forth, in turn, from every chord, The thronging notes in ceaseless shower. Following thy measures, as they rise, Upfloating forms of every hue Shall flit before my half-closed eyes, And I will dream the visions true. Breathless I list the streaming wires, Responsive to the minstrel-hand, While faded hopes and young desires Come stealing back, a pensive band; Ah! now I know the sounds too well Thy murmuring strings are fain to move, For when may Memory cease to dwell On Her, who loved that lay of love! For She could win thine every key, From strains that suit a lady's bower, To fits of wildest minstrelsy From moonlight glen or lonely tower. Bold swelling notes of war—yet such The most as told of pity near— She loved them all! and every touch Recals my wandering thoughts to Her. Vain dreams, away! In vacant mood Now let my wearied heart recline; No more I call on Fancy's brood To mix, sweet Harp! their spells with thine. Like one who drifts in idle boat Unoared, and heedless whither bound, Thus, languid laid, oh! let me float Adown thy silvery stream of sound. 'Tis soft as evening's dewy sigh, Sweeter than summer's balmiest breath; Half conscious—half entranced—I lie, And seem to touch the verge of death. And, thus beguiled, how blest it were To cross that dark and fated sea! Then, just escaped this world of care, To wake, and—Nea! dwell with Thee! MID-DAY. 'Tis deepest Mid-day! Not a sound is heard, Save this low insect-murmur; which yet seems No voice from mere capricious things of life, But some mysterious tone of Earth herself, Holy as Silence! Not a shadow flits Checquering the plain; no sign of coming change Varies the sky; no thinnest breath of air Wafts movement to a bough. Th' unsoftened hills Stare broadly out, as if they ne'er had known The veiling touch of Eve; while the hot sea, Waveless to sight as frozen oceans are, Beams steadfastly beneath the steadfast sun. 'Tis a strange fixedness, which links with thoughts Of old eternity; and half might seem To him who broods in its deep quietude, As if our world were an unchanging thing, Where all hath been so from the very first, And evermore must be. REMEMBRANCE OF SUNSET. Where silent elms are clustering round That grey church-tower, which peers above, She sleeps beneath the narrow mound, Whom I had loved with brother's love. The sun, o'er yonder wooded height Slow-drawing on his evening streak, Had glanced a ray of rosy light Athwart her pale and dying cheek; And while that glorious orb of his Yet hung—departing—in the west, Amid a kindred scene like this Her noble spirit sank to rest. But, ever since, this westering light, These purpled hills, that flaming sea, Those streaks o'er yonder wooded height, Though beauteous still, are sad to me. THE TWO HARPS. I tarried on the strains to hang Outfloating from yon ancient trees; Strains from two airy harps, that rang Responsive to the minstrel breeze. One, chaunting to the wind that wooed, Swang full on every gazer's eye; The other, far within the wood, Low breathed its hermit melody. This told a tale of nought but gladness; Of frolic nymphs on tiptoe stealing; And feats of wine and festive madness; Gay Fauns that danced and Satyrs reeling. The other sighed so sad a tone, Methought some desolate child of air Had made those very strings his own To vent heart-broken anguish there. Each harp was sweet; yet while—not vain— Thrilled thro' the sense the livelier din, That other sweetest—saddest strain— My inmost spirit drank it in. Then deem not, deem not—Emmeline! That Abra's frolic glance of glee From thee my steadfast faith can win, From thee, my gentlest love! from thee. E'en now when 'mid yon blazing room A dream of joy—she floats inspired, I come to court the tender gloom, Where thou dost love to sit retired; And while she bids the rest rejoice With winning word—with winning wile— I turn to catch thy plaintive voice— I flee—to win thy thoughtful smile. Let frolic from her dark eyes peep; Mine be the blue which tear-drops fill; For if her charm of joy strike deep, Thy pensive spells sink deeper still. 1820 WRITTEN AT RICHMOND. Thames swept along in summer pride, Sparkling beneath his verdant edge; With frolic kiss, as, half-denied, Light airs were glancing o'er the tide, Or whispering in the secret sedge. Cheerful the landscape's sunny green,— Yet still, in pensive mood reclined, Pondering of things to be, or been, I shrank at many a visioned scene Of fear—before; of grief—behind. The insect-tribes, but newly born, Were flaunting in the' awake'ning ray; In me they woke no touch of scorn; I saw them frail, but more to mourn The kindred doom of man's decay. For here, of old, his booty won, The Dane caroused in barbarous glee, Or Roman veteran, toil-foredone, Lay stretched beneath the westering sun, In dreams of pleasant Italy. Or floating by, in gallant show, Gay beauty glanced at monarch's jest, Nor marked where, high above the prow, 'Mid mirth and wine, and music's flow, Sat Change—a dark and threatening guest. Their mirth is sped; their gravest theme Sleeps with the things that cease to be; Their longest life—a morning gleam; A bubble bursting on the stream, Then swept to Time's unfathomed sea. Yes! all, beneath or Change or Chance, And passing, like the passing river, The wassail shout, the dreamer's trance, And monarch's jest, and beauty's glance, Were human all, and gone for ever! REMINISCENCE. TO? Yes, Lady! yes—that voice of thine, That voice of thine, whose strange control Steals o'er this wondering heart of mine, As forth the touching accents roll; On which, beneath the noon-day grove, So late my rapt attention hung, While that sweet tale of father's love Came faltering from a daughter's tongue; Yes, Lady! yes—that voice of thine Recalls a voice I knew before, And well may stir this heart of mine With throbs it deemed to feel no more. And then thy sweetly-pensive smile, Whose sweetness seems to strive with pain, This, too, in her beloved erewhile, In thee betrays my heart again. Yet when to smile of thine I cling, I seem as to the dead untrue; And what a joy thy voice would bring, But that it brings a sorrow too! I look—I listen—loth to part; Yet wish that we had never met; And feel how sadly fares a heart, Twixt love that vibrates and regret. 1821 DESTINY. Chorus.— “Who holds the helm of that necessity?Prometheus.— “The three-fold Fates and unforgetting Furies.Chorus.— “Is Jove less absolute than these are?Prometheus. “Yea: And therefore cannot 'scape what is ordained.” Translation of the Prometheus, by Elizabeth B. Barrett. “Strange Power! mysterious Destiny! Thou who dost love to sit, alone, With moveless lip, and brooding eye, Close beside the' eternal throne; When from the Godhead's forming hand The globe leapt forth, He gave command That Thou shouldst guard the circling sphere, And guide, and balance, and control The mighty mass, the breathing soul, And heed the vast machinery roll Through Time's immortal year. “Or may it be, as some have thought, That from the very birth of Time, While yet this whirling globe was not, Thy primal spirit ruled sublime; That, when the mighty Being came To forge this world's ænigma-frame, He felt thy power no less than We; But learned how Thou the Good and Ill Hadst doomed in endless course to wheel, And curbed e'en his wide-shadowing will Reluctantly to Thee? See motto, p. 140. “Before or since, effect or cause, Or limiting, or limited, Yet say, oh! whence those dooming laws, Or His or Thine, so dark—so dread. In anger was it, or in mirth, Ye bade Oppression walk the earth, Torturing the race with scourge and chain? Why flaunts yon despot on a throne By treachery reared and blood-bestrown, While Kosciusko's dungeon-groan Ascends to Heaven in vain? “Hath virtue then no saving force, Hath justice no prevailing might To stay that scythed chariot's course, Dark as eclipse and swift as light? Inwoven in one eternal chain, Evil and good, and bliss and pain, Are all the links alike to Thee? Brute forms that breathe, high souls that feel, Matter inert and human will, Stamped all with one portentous seal To work one blind decree? “Man sinks in musing wonder lost! Meanwhile his bark, with shattered sail, Fast verging to some unknown coast, Hurries adown the unslackening gale. Amid thy gathering mysteries In vain for glimpse of light he tries To trace his course—to read his doom; He fears the sea, he dreads the shore, And darkness thickening more and more, Till hope, and fear, and suffering o'er, Thou wreck'st him on the tomb.” By one, through many a change of grief Full sorely tried, these words were spoken; But Heaven in pity sent relief To troubled brain and heart half-broken. The self-same star, to Syrian land That led, of old, the Magi-band, Uplit for him that night of pain; And beamed on that despairing sight, With the first flush of morning light, A clasping haven, calmly bright, Beyond Life's stormy main. TO S. C. The chords thy ready fingers used to move At fond request of dear domestic love, Now grief, alas! hath tried that heart too much, Thou yieldest up to meet another's touch. No longer thine, they leave us yet behind The better music of thy well-tuned mind, Whose various melodies, each singly sweet, Make of thy life one harmony complete; And Love's firm tone, which time nor clime can mar, And ne'er one shock of temper comes to jar. TO THE LAMENTED MEMORY OF F. H. C. Sweet friend, farewell! to whom propitious birth Gave beauty—sense—the prosperous goods of earth; To whom not less were faith and duty given, Those better gifts which fit our earth for heaven. First by glad days—then through long sickness tried, 'Mid pleasures—pure—by pain still purified;— Such was that soul, which meekly kissed the rod, Then soared, for us too soon, and rests with God. Farewell! our love inscribes this faithful stone, Not to bewail thy lot, but weep our own. TO THE BELOVED MEMORY OF CHARLOTTE H. This and the following piece were written by a late dearest friend of the author. Beloved! oh, most beloved! forgive the tear Affection drops upon thy silent bier; And, as thy spirit soars to realms above, Pity the anguish of a sister's love; Shed on her struggling heart thy heavenly rest, And teach to bless the lot, which makes Thee blest. But oh! how hard the stroke, which comes to sever Hearts linked in love—that could have loved for ever. Not to the grave, then, weeping let me look— Ascend, my Soul! to where that sacred Book Records our mortal deeds; and there behold The Mercy-scroll by Seraph-touch unrolled; Trace amid acts of love the path she trod, And see her spirit pure before its God. CAROLINE K. 1827. SONNETS. FREEDOM. Tis not because fierce swords are flashing there, With license and a reckless scorn of life, When for some petty gaud upstarts a strife, That Freedom there must harbour. Slavery's air Breeds many a liveried satrap, prompt to dare, And soldier-serfs are ready there and rife To march at summons of the jerking fife. But where swords—some—are turned to ploughshares; where Others, not rusted, o'er the household hearth, In peaceful pomp, near cradled babe are hung; And sires rest reverenced in holy earth, And marriage-bells with holy cheer are rung, There Freedom dwells, Constraint's sublime reward. And Peace must rear her, e'en if War must guard. TO MY FRIEND, JOSEPH RITCHIE, This very amiable and accomplished young man died in the attempt. ABOUT TO EXPLORE THE NIGER. Ritchie! to whom it shall be given to view And trace (none worthier) that strange river's swell, The desert's glory and its mystery too; Oft when those Afran sands immeasurable, And wearisome alike of form and hue, Shall hang upon thy spirits like a spell, Yet then shall recollections, bright and true, Of thine own land, like waters from a well, Rise to refresh thee; vale and pastoral stream, And cottage smokes that curl thro' evening air, And cultured plains, where populous cities teem, And voice of friend beloved shall all be there, With thought of guerdon high from Honour's hand To cheer thy progress thro' that dangerous land. SUGGESTED BY THE DEATH OF CHARLES SKINNER MATTHEWS. Joyously launched on life's untravelled streams, Youth fears nor open sea nor treacherous bay; Gay voyager, whose wildly devious way Fond hope and fancy cheer with mingled gleams. Yet fondly deem not thou those cloudless beams That hail thy morn shall wait thy closing day; Autumnal storms must rend the blooms of May, And life's first blisses fade like very dreams. Then blest are they, who, at the current's head, Have quaffed the gushing waters cold and clear, Nor tracked them downward to their oozy bed; Inhaled the morning zephyr's freshening breath, Then, ere the gathering winds of night they hear, Seek peacefully the silent couch of Death. TO GEORGE HAYTER, ESQ. ON HIS PICTURE OF THE TRIAL OF LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL. Hayter! almost I deemed the pencil's art Too weak to cope with that renownèd story, That tale—of sorrow much, but more of glory, How beauteous Russell played her matchless part. Now, gazing on thy fervent work, my heart Recants, and drinks therefrom unstinted pleasure; For ne'er did history's pen, nor poet's measure, More touching sense of that brave scene impart. Kindling, I gaze; and, still the more I gaze, I feel my blood in brisker current moving; While pure and high emotions stream, like rays, From his calm bearing—her intensest loving— Till every breath I draw is honour's breath, And my stirred heart's sole throb—heroic death. RACINE AND SHAKSPEARE. As one too long immured in courtly bower, Such as Le Nôtre shaped, high-wrought and trim, And of the world admired, though less by him Whose soul hath felt the charm of Nature's power; If chance some sunny glade, freshened with shower, Arrest his step; sudden—eyes, heart, and limb, Feel the delight, and pleasant thoughts up-brim At sight of natural herb or forest flower, Or wild brook in its freedom wandering: Thus, mine own Shakspeare, sweet it is to me 'Mid Arden's woods, with wild deer communing, Or arm in arm with Jaquez, far to flee My late imprisonment, ill-brooked, within The stately garden-ground of smooth Racine. CHILDHOOD. TO? I judge not hardly childhood's giddy glee; For I remember when my mother died, Half-wondering at that age what death might be, How few the tears I shed. And when they hied To shape her garden-grave (use,—sanctified Among the dwellers of our tropic isle) Where tamarind and orange, side by side, Wove brightest bower, I too was there the while; If moist-eyed 'mid the sad, yet curious more Than sorrowful. But when the blasted rock, Impracticable else, shook off a store Of fruit, down raining at the nitrous shock, On rushed I, with a childish joy, to seize My spoil, the fruit of those grave-shadowing trees. CHILDHOOD—(continued.) TO? Yet brood deep feelings in the youngling breast, Though undeveloped, natural as speech; And my own tropic isle this truth impressed, That Nature teaches more than man may teach. 'Twas on an orange-tree, just within reach Of childish hands, a bird had built her nest, A mother-bird; and ne'er more impious breach Than mine upon that blissful home of rest, On sleeping town did night-sped warrior make; And memory yet recals the mournful song Which the reft parent, for her nestlings' sake, Poured, round her ruined dwelling hovering long; While every touch, that did her grief impart, Dropt, like a precept, on my conscious heart. CHILDHOOD—(continued.) TO? So when, mere child, I crossed the Atlantic tide, Ah! ne'er to see our Carib isle again— There, as it chanced, the watchful seaman spied A bark come drifting o'er the azure plain; Which, as it neared us, we beheld it void Of living thing—alone on that wide main; Hinting a tale of wretches that had died By rock, or whelming surge, or hunger-slain On the waste wave. So on that bark did go Unquestioned; bearing o'er the waters blue Its own mysterious story—none might know; But left me, as it faded on the view, With spirit stirred, and eye unconsciously That strained upon that solitary sea. LOVE IN DISGUISE. Unscathed through Beauty's thorny ways Be mine, I said, henceforth to rove; Too long hath Love consumed my days, But now I shut my heart to love. The Godhead heard—and “Ah!—not so”— With gay malicious glance, he cries, “Who thinks to foil my fairer blow, By wile, a surer victim, dies.” And soon in Friendship's shape he came,— Ah! how might I the cheat divine? No fear had I of Friendship's flame,— And led me to that bower of thine: And o'er us slipped a silken band,— Friendship's it seemed to be—no more; And yet, I own, mere Friendship's hand Had never thrilled me so before. Anon—in critic Taste's disguise, He bade me scan each outward charm; I scanned them with admiring eyes, And all without one thought of harm. Last—aged Wisdom's form he wore;— With Wisdom what had Love to do?— “Mind—temper—heart”—he said—“explore;” I found them sage, and kind and true. In Friendship's—Taste's—and Wisdom's guise, 'Twas so Love came my heart to move; What blindness—never to surmise That each was but a mask for Love! GROWING ATTACHMENT. With the freshness and placid sensations of morning, As yet all unconscious of hope or of plan, (Sweet gleams through thin hazes the prospect adorning,) 'Twas thus that our dawn of attachment began. If 'twere Friendship or Love, that we knew not full surely, But yet 'twas delicious to saunter along, Not quite quessing whither, but feeling securely, With such omens around us—we couldn't go wrong. With hearts thus uncertain, (for hearts have their weather,) Full many a pathway we threaded, and grove; Till, at last, (so it fell,) we stood plighting together In the precincts—nay, right in the presence of Love. We have plighted! And now—(as yon mid-sun is beaming With the hazes of morning no longer at strife)— So Love his meridian fervour is streaming, And quickening all round us the landscape of life. If mists gather o'er, he pervades and enlightens; His eyes glance a magic wherever they fall; A magic the Present—the Future that brightens; That modifies, beautifies, glorifies all. And dost Thou then sigh, his duration distrusting, And deem'st Thou such brilliancy never can last? That suns shall wax fainter; that hearts will be rusting, And that lovers must weep over happiness—past. What though glorious at mid-day the Master of Heaven, Yet are they less dear, his slant rays, ere he part? And hath not Love too his mild glories of even, His warm peaceful hues—his soft skies for the heart? And such are the colours his hand shall shed over us, When youth's throbbing pulse shall to calmness give place; Enough that, when silence and darkness shall cover us, We have felt his full flame—and but die with the race. And I feel it, Belovèd!—they do not deceive us, Who say that, hereafter, some welcoming shore Shall to home of yet brighter existence receive us, To love, as we now love, and ne'er to part more. EARTHLY PARTING. Had Heaven, to prayer of mine more kind, But snapped my thread of Being first, I know how, lingering here behind, Thou wouldst have deemed thy lot the worst; And how thou wouldst have shed the tear Over my coldly silent bier. But this, alas! might not be so, And I remain to weep for Thee; And still weep on, though well I know Such parting is but life's decree; That, doomed to leave, or left forlorn, We must be mourned for, or must mourn. RECALLING. My happier life's departed joy! But whom no more our sorrows press! When lesser griefs this mind annoy, Or the heart strives in strong distress, Though Thou all ills wert wont to cheer, It is not then I wish Thee here. But when impend nor clouds nor storms, Earth—sky—when each its calm imparts, And beauty breathes from outward forms, And, better still, from inward hearts, Since these things were to Thee most dear, 'Tis then I sigh to have Thee here. SILCHESTER At Silchester, near Reading, are still seen extensive walls of a Roman town. My travels' dream and talk for many a year, At length I view thee, hoary Silchester! Pilgrim long vowed; now only hither led, As with new zeal by fervent Mitford fed, See “Our Village,” vol. i. page 71. Third Edition. Miss Mitford has also printed a short poem on the same subject. Whose voice of poesy and classic grace Had breathed a new religion on the place. 'Scaped from the pride, the smoke, the busy hum Of our metropolis, a later Rome, How sweet to win one calm, uncrowded day, Where congregated man hath passed away! For these old city-walls, a half-league round, Are but the girdle now of rural ground; These stones from far-off fields, toil-gathered thence For man's protection, but a farm's ring-fence; The fruit of all his planning and his pain By Nature's certain hand resumed again! Yet eyes instructed, as along they pass, May learn from crossing lines of stunted grass, And stunted wheat-stems, that refuse to grow, What intersecting causeways sleep below. And ploughshare, deeplier delving on its path, Will oft break in on pavement quaint or bath; Or flax-haired little one, from neighbouring cot, Will hap on rusted coin, she knows not what; 'Bout which, though grave collectors make great stir, Some pretty pebble found had more contented her. From trees that shade thine amphitheatre, Hoarse caws the rook, and red-breast carols clear; All silent else! nor human foot nor call Are heard to-day within its turfy wall; Gone—many a century since—its shouts—its shows. Here thought may now hold commune with repose. Yet sheds the sun no other evening glow, Than tinged these walls two thousand years ago; While leaves, e'en such as then in autumn fell, Twirling adown with faint decaying smell, Mix with the pensive thoughts of ruin well. These walls already reared did Cæsar see? Rose they, Stonehenge! coevally with thee, Whose years, in prose untold or Druid-rhyme, Still baffle thought—the riddle of old Time? Or was it Rome first fixed to fortify This pleasant spot? deserted when? or why? What name, familiar to historic ear, Ruled this hill-circled track, Proconsul here; And master of these fields, though fair they be, Sighed for his sunny vines beyond the Tyrrhene sea? Within these bounds when Jove's high altar stood, Was the oak worshipped in yon sloping wood? And did cach creed, as creeds are wont to do, The other scorn, and hold itself the true? Declare, Geologist! what ancient sea These flinty nodules fashioned, thus to be Ruin or rock, as each—a mystery! Thy very name a puzzle! Yet, I wis, Seanning these flints, 'twas “Castrum Silicis,” My books away, I vouch not how it is; For heavy tomes of antiquarian lore Burden the traveller much, if reader more. In vain for Cicerone round I seek; Speak, ancient bulwarks! your own story speak; Vexed heretofore by dilettanti lungs, How often have I wished that stones had tongues! Can He explain, stretched silent as his fold, Perchance of Latin blood, yon shepherd old, Himself a crumbling ruin of fourscore? “The Romish folk, he says, dwelt here of yore;” 'Tis all he knows—the learned searce know more. Slow I muse on, in idle question lost, If knowledge or if mystery please the most. DORCHESTER AMPHITHEATRE. 1836. By Rome's old amphitheatre I stood, Still pretty perfect, on the Weymouth road, Within some half a mile of Dorchester. There had I come, as others come, to feed A curious eye, and win such thoughts as spring From sense of contrast 'twixt the ideal Past And the fact-speaking Present. In good sooth Strange contrast did I find; for all within The oval boundary of that fair arena Was seen to spread a most unclassic growth Of vile potatoes! Plant, to me it seems, Aye somewhat vile to view; which, when the World New-found first gave it to our older climes, She gave with true utilitarian aim, Far more for use than beauty. But these were Of all most vile; black spotted, with torn leaves And draggled stalks; dank and disconsolate As Autumn rains and trampling feet could make them. Some pauper-hand had sown the ragged crop; No peasant's, but some mean suburban hand; Whether with license from the corporation, Or of his own coarse will I might not learn, 'Twas a sore check to fancy; and, full sure, Fine lady or yet finer gentleman, Fastidious dandlers of their own sweet wills, At once had quitted, in a brisk disgust, Potatoes—amphitheatre—and all. But I had learned (a lesson time will teach) To make the best of matters, and, beside, 'Tis a wise pride, through the mind's alchemy, To draw a pleasure from poor promisings: Nor hard the task; for let but patience watch The process, and up-comes, in no long time, Through subtile ducts of feeling or of thought, The good which lurks in all things. So I went not; But, laid at length upon the topmost edge Of that green circus, failed not soon to win Full recompence. For the benignant air Was very bliss to breathe; and evening, now, Was slanting her long shadows o'er the land, And, with her shadows, peace! All told of peace, Insensate things and things of life; each flake Of floating cloud, like white-sailed bark becalmed, That paused in the blue sky; the thrifty rook, Last labourer in the newly furrowed field, Seen wending homeward on slow-waving wing; And unyoked ox that, tranquil still, though freed, Swayed leisurely by, to food and needful rest In stable or night pasture. Nor did man Not profit by the hour; but stole him forth From out the precinct of the toiling town To taste, abroad, our nobler human rest, Which links with meditation; pondering, now, The quiet of the plain; now sending forth Freed thought to travel 'mid the circling hills. Who may misprize Dorchestrian hills? What though They tower to no such height as looks with scorn Over a dwindled plain; what though no crags Be there to fortify; no forest belts To gird them midway round; yet theirs, instead, Are graceful slopes with shadowy dips between; And theirs are breezy summits, not too high To recognise familiar sights, and catch Familiar sounds of life, the ploughman's call Or tinkling from the fold. Yet thence the eye Feeds on no stinted landscape, sky and earth And the blue sea; and thence may wingèd thought, Which ever loves the vantage ground of hills, Launch amid buoyant air, and soar at will. Fair, amid these, art thou, camp-crested Mount, In some far time, for some forgotten cause, Named of the Maiden Maiden Castle is a hill, with a camp on it, near Dorchester.. Nor doth surer lore Attest if Briton or if Roman wound Those triple trenches round thee; regular As terraces, by architect up-built For princely pleasure-ground, or those, far-famed, By ancient hunters made—so some have deemed— Or else by Nature's self in wild Glenroy. See Geological Transactions, vol. iv. series i. page 393. Along thy sides they stretch, ring above ring, Marking thee from afar; then vanish round Like the broad shingly banks, which ocean heaves In noble curves along his winding shore. The passing wayfarer with wonder views E'en at imperfect distance, their bold lines, And asks the Who? the Wherefore? and the When? Wafting his spirit back into far times, And dreaming as he goes. But whoso stays, And climbs the turf-way to thy tabled top, Shall reap a fuller wonder; shall behold Thy girdled area, of itself a plain, Where widely feeds the scattered flock; shall mark Thy trenches, complicate' with warlike art, And deep almost as natural ravine Cut in the mountain; or some startling rent In the blue-gleaming glacier; or as clefts, Severing the black and jagged lava-walls, Which old Vesuvius round his crater flings, Outworks, to guard the mysteries within. But these are smooth and verdant. Tamed long since, Breastwork abrupt and pallisaded mound Are, now, but sloping greensward; as if Nature, Who vainly her mild moral reads to man, Still strove to realize the blessed days, By seers avouched, by statesmen turned to dreams, When war shall be no more. So mused I there! As who had failed to muse? But now the sun, Silently sunken, with departing light Had fused the whole horizon; not alone His western realm, but flooded refluent gold Back to the southern hills, along whose tops Are seen to stretch, in far continuous line, Sepulchral barrows. Brightly-verdant cones I marked them rise beneath his earlier ray; But now they stood against that orange light Each of a velvet blackness; like the bier Before some high-illumined altar spread When a king lies in state; and well might seem To twilight fantasy, like funeral palls, Shrouding the bones of aboriginal men, Who there had lived and died, long ere our tribes Had heard the name or felt the conquering arms Of Rome or Roman; or as yet had seen, Mocking their hearths of clay and turf-built huts, The prætor's quaint mosaic or tiled bath; Or heard our hard-school task, the phrase of Terence, Bandied in common parlance round the land. This was the hour of Fancy, Spirit shy! Who weaves no dreams beneath the garish day, Or if indeed she weave, yet tells them not, So fearful of the comment, or the jeer. Nay, still the more from vulgar guess to hide Her visionary themes, will oft put on, With harmless treachery, worldly masquerade Of common-place or business; squaring now Some dull frivolity of daily life, Visit or etiquette; now poring o'er Law book or ledger, or long-drawn report Of grave committee, just as if she prized The things she seems to ponder: but when night Is in the heaven, her natural day begins. Then, like yon star, which, when the morning sun Came forth, first trembled, and then dropt away To unobserved seclusion, and yet now Once more hangs thoughtful in the twilight sky; E'en so doth Fancy venture forth again To float among the tinted clouds of eve; And—hovering now—now car-like borne along— Imbues her visions with their loveliest hues, And gives them back yet lovelier of her own. Ere long, uncontradicted and more bold, She gives command to Matter and to Space To work her bidding; and behold! the Twain, Like Genii-servants of the lamp or ring, Contract themselves at once, or else dilate As she would have it. Nor may Time oppose His realm's remoteness, parted by the gulf Of cycled centuries; for she knows to weave Her gossamer threads so subtile, yet so strong, That linkèd by the long invisible line, Present and Past are one. This was her hour, The potent hour of Fancy! As of old The games were just beginning; and I saw The rural dwellers hastening o'er the plain By ones, and twos, and threes; some quaint to view With their own painted skins, and some hirsute In spoil of wolf or bear. A denser mass Poured from the crowded city; helm and gown, The soldier and civilian; and, ere long, These circling seats, almost obliterate' now, And where the shy mole-cricket, undisturbed, Creaks his funereal note, were thronged with looks So eager—so intent—it seemed as if No desolation e'er could touch the place. Mingled they sat, conquered and conqueror; The intruder and the native of the land; Fair British damsel by dark Roman maid; And whoso had but scanned, with curious eye, The multitude there met, had singled out Each separate race, distinct as then they showed, Ere holy marriage rites, and lapse of years, Had fused the swarthy South and paler North Into one blended beauty. Fancy still Relaxed not, and behold! the games went on. But here no wretched gladiator died, To stimulate the jaded taste corrupt Of a luxurious city, mingling blood And sport together; here no lordly brute, Pride of his woods, tiger nor spotted 'pard Was brought to bathe his beautiful sides in gore. But simple games were here, befitting well Remoter province. Yet there wanted not The course of chariots, seven times rapt around The level circus; nor impetuous speed Of the foot-racer swift; nor clenchèd hand With cestus mailed; nor strong transcendent arm Whirling the discus far and far away. Here too were jugglers' feats, with many a feint Of the quick hand, deceiving eye and guess; Perchance transmitted down from those who strove With Moses, when the rods to serpents rolled In ancient Egypt, aye for magic famed; And whose strange sorceries even now perplex The traveller, and send him doubting home. And graceful dancers here from Southern Gaul Wove their gay measures, with half-wingèd feet Quivering in air, as if the air were half Their element; nor was there lack of song From smooth Italian clime, nor of sweet flute, Breathing some lay, on slope of Aready First framed by love-sick shepherd; courting now Barbarian ears; which yet delighted heard, And treasured up the strain. Him too I saw— (For Fancy bodied forth whate'er she willed)— The shepherd-minstrel of remotest time, Zampognatore The Zampognatori are the picturesque bag-pipers of Italy., who, with moving arm, From the pressed bag compels the struggling air Into a liquid music. He had strayed From his Calabrian home, lone wanderer, For humble gain, thus far; and such, e'en now, Gay Naples! when returning Christmas brings High festival, amid thy crowded streets Are seen and heard, hymning each sacred shrine. In simple sheep-skin clad, they wend along, (Rude vesture! worn of old, when men first watched Their feeding flocks along the grassy hills,) And seem like records of an earlier world, Linking the Past and Present. And, full oft, (If Fancy might presume on holy ground,) Me would she fondly lure to dream that such As these, perchance, in old Judæa's land, The missioned angel summoned from their folds, To learn the glorious birth in Bethlehem! A pause—and, lo! two well-trained wrestlers come, Briton with Roman matched; and as they stand Eyeing each other, face to face, erect, Look like bold statues, which some master-hand Hath wrought to best proportion. Soon their arms Are grasping each the other's at full length. Anon they stoutly close; and while they strive Each one to stir the other from the base Of his firm footing, you behold them rock Like gallant vessels in a stormy surge, Whose proud yards almost touch the deep; or trees Full-foliaged, which, when some mighty wind Sweeps through the forest, stagger to and fro, Full soon to fall! A thousand straining eyes, And utter silence, and suspended breaths, Are waiting on the contest; till, at last, By one collected effort whirled amain, Prostrate the Roman lies. Then all at once Bursts a loud shout from the rude tribes around, Mixed with the broad uncultured laugh. Yet one Stood there, who joined not in the laugh nor shout, A chieftain of the land! but deeply groaned Within his inmost soul to mark his race, Firm as they were of valour and of limb, Thus to the stranger bowed. Yet wherefore groan? Finite is human wrong; while Justice holds Eternally—to balance and redress— Her righteous scales above. Not far away, In modest beauty sat a British maid, That chieftain's daughter. She nor heard the shout, Nor marked the triumph. All her thoughts, the while, Were in the Imperial City; thither led By tale of young centurion, whose dark plume, As he bent o'er her, nearer and more near, Soft-shadowed her sweet face. From him she heard Of mighty amphitheatres, within Whose ample bounds a hundred chariots roll; Then—flooded to broad lakes—a hundred barks Glide o'er their vast arenas. Passing by, In pity to that pitying heart of hers, Combat of man or beast, he spoke of shows More gentle, that enforced no shuddering ear. He told her of the nodding elephant, Huge and compact of bulk, and girt with tower; And dromedary of ungainly stride; And still more rare, and stranger still of form, Camelopard; yet prized for sinuous grace Of neck, and delicate step, and loving eye, Mild as her own. She, with half doubting eyes, Expanding as he spoke, sat by and listened, Scarce knowing if she might believe or not; Hard though it were such speaker not to trust. Then would he tell her of proud palaces, Temples, and towers; yet most he loved to speak Of his own native home, their Sabine farm; Where still his mother dwelt, 'mid their own fields, Their fruitful olive trees and tents of vine; Vaunting his dear Penates; yet therewith Mingling, as if by chance, some gentle word Of Cupid and of Hymen. Thence I turned To the benign Proconsul. He was one, Or so imagination loved to feign, Of Rome's first blood, tracing his lofty line, Through long-drawn pedigree and consular fast, To race of Lelius or of Scipio; And thence fore-born large thoughts to interweave Of statesman and of sage. Some warrior-pride He well might feel, beholding all around His steadfast soldiery, and the strong walls Of the near city, and those camp-crowned hills, Plucked from their fierce defenders. Yet his heart Was gentle, and his mind full-fraught with lore From history won, and humanized by power Of mild philosophy; nor lacked he love For Maro's polished strain, or bolder song Of old Mæonides. And now, e'en now, Amid this throng and tumult of the games, There seemed to flit athwart his pensive brow Such thoughts, as oft, at eve, will touch the soul Of him who sojourns in a foreign land. Say, did he think on his own native Rome And fallen empires? on Etruria old, Gone like a dream—on Carthage, vanish'd too— And the razed walls of proud Jerusalem? Then ask himself if that barbarian flood, Rolled from the stormy regions of the North, Billow on billow, and o'erhanging now In dread suspense, should yet withhold its wave; Or burst in vengeance on sweet Italy, Whelming her ancient glories? Did he muse How, then, each conquered realm, long tributary, The Dacian tribes, wide Gaul and mountain-Spain Should snap their bonds? and e'en this isle remote Start from its vassalage, perhaps to pluck Itself—some shred of empire? Prescience Thus far might warn from shrine of thoughtful mind, Or yet more thoughtful heart, deceiving not. But not far thoughts, nor deep humanities, Nor clear experience from old histories won, Might hint of all the coming. Who might tell How ships, contemptuous of the guiding shore, Should breast right onward o'er strange seas, and find A world as yet unknown; all bold to dare —Though still beat back—the beakèd promontory, For ever weltered round by stormy waves, From which the trireme bark had shrunk amazed? Then burst on other oceans, all unguessed Till now, far-spread and thousand-islanded, Amid new climates and beneath new stars? Not well-known constellations; not the Twins, Orion, nor the ancient Pleiades; But stars yet unbeheld; which when, at first, The helmsman viewed, he doubted his own eyes, Perchance grown old, or else with watching worn, And questioned if he read aright; or if To mar the boldness of presumptuous man, Who dared (for so might be) forbidden seas, The very heavens themselves were changed. Or how Might'st Thou, Proconsul mild! (albeit full-stored With lore of statesman, and far-reaching thought) How might'st thou dream that this barbarian isle, O'er which it seemed half-exile e'en to rule, This Britain utterly from the world shut out, Should rise from strife to strife, from strength to strength, Foremost among the nations; conquering O'er lands and seas to which the Roman realm, In its most lordly day, was but a speck? That she should shed her laws, her polity, Her cultured language, and her peaceful arts, All she had stored from her own toils, and all That came from Rome or Greece transmitted down, A glorious gift! o'er half the peopled globe? There to survive, when she, perchance, may be What Rome and Greece are now! Change deep as this, What oracle might bring thee to believe? Or that, in tract of time, a day could come, When, in this very amphitheatre, A common plant—its lonely tenant now— By a chance-traveller scanned—should summon up, To dim the glories of departed Rome, The mightier marvel of a new-found world? SHRINE OF THE VIRGIN Written to illustrate Sicily, in Finden's Tableaux, 1838. PART I. “The traveller, who hears that vesper-bell, Howe'er employed, must send a prayer to heaven: In foreign lands I liked the custom well, For with the calm and sober thoughts of even It well accords; and, wert Thou journeying there, It would not hurt thee, George! to join that vesper-prayer.” Southey's Saint Gualberto. Who knows not, fair Sicilian land! How proudly thou wert famed of yore, When all the Muses hymned thy strand, And, pleased to tread so sweet a shore, Bacchus and Ceres, hand in hand, To thee their choicest treasures bore, And saw upreared their graceful shrines 'Mid waving corn and curling vines. Yes—land thou wert of fruits and flowers, The favoured land of Deity; By Jove made glad with suns and showers, By Neptune cheered with brightest sea; E'en Dis, beneath his gloomy bowers, Had heard, and loved to dream of thee, And, when he willed to take a bride, Snatched her from Enna's sloping side. Those hollow creeds have passed away, Those false, if graceful, shrines are gone; A purer faith, of stricter sway, For our behoof, their place hath won; And Christian altars overlay Yon temple's old foundation stone; And in Minerva's The present cathedral of Syracuse was formerly a temple of Minerva. vacant cell Sublimest wisdom deigns to dwell. And where, within some deep shy wood, And, seen but half through curving bough, In silent marble Dian stood, Behold! a holier Virgin, now, Hath sanctified the solitude; And Thou, meek Mary—Mother! thou, Dost hallow each old pagan spot, Or storied stream or fabled grot. The devious pilgrim, far beguiled, How gladly doth he turn to greet Thy long sought image 'mid the wild, A calming thought—a vision sweet. If grief be his then, Lady mild! Thy gentle aid he will entreat, And, bowed in heart not less than deed, Findeth a prayer to fit the need. There, while his secret soul he bares, That lonely altar bending by, The traveller, passing unawares, Shall stay his step—but not too nigh— And hearkening to those unforced prayers, Albeit the creed he may deny, Shall own his reason less averse, And spirit, surely, not the worse. Thy shrines are lovely—wheresoe'er— And yet—if it were mine to choose One—loveliest—where fretted Care Might come, to rest—or Thought, to muse— 'Twould be that one, so soft and fair, That standeth by old Syracuse; Just where those salt-sea waters take The likeness of an inland lake. Green tendrilled plants, in many a ring, Creep round the grey stone, tenderly, As though in very love to cling And clasp it; while the reverent sea A fond uplooking wave doth bring, To break, anon, submissively; As if it came that brow to greet, Then whisper praise beneath thy feet. When suns, that sink in twilight clear, Forth from the city tempt to roam, Be mine to meet sweet evening here, And muse on friends I've left at home. But She, who loves the mariner, Shall yet more duly hither come, Where, fitly, thou art held to be Our Guardian Lady of the Sea. PART II. She cometh to the seaward shrine, A mother, with her children three; And they have made the holy sign, And they have dropped on bended knee; Three in the lowly rite combine, And one is cradled peaceably. That mother's heart hath business here, For she doth love the mariner. Her gallant boy is on the deep; She loves him more that he is brave; Yet when around Peloro's steep The midnight surges leap and rave, What marvel if a mother weep! And, thinking on the tropic wave, Doth flee to thee, Oh mother mild! Thou mother of the blessed child! Through winds that sweep like hurricane, And deadly lightning's lurid light, She speedeth to the pillared fane, Where thou dost stand in silver bright In the cathedral church of Syracuse there stands a silver statue of the Virgin.. If solace but for him she gain, What should a mother's soul affright! And now the porch-way she doth win, And thro' the portal glideth in. I love the ever open door That welcomes to the house of God! I love the wide-spread marble floor, By every foot in freedom trod! Free altars let me kneel before, Free as the pathway or the sod, Whence journeying pilgrim, 'mid broad air, Wafts unpremeditated prayer. She prayeth 'mid the silent pile; Her whispers round the columns creep; She prayeth all alone; the while Her babes at home securely sleep. Their brother loved to see her smile— She would not they should see her weep; Youth's rightful joys she will not dim With tears—not even tears for him. But now, when eve is calm and bright, You see her here; and not alone; Her children, in the sweet blue light, Are with her by the sculptured stone; With her they share a soothing sight, Yon scarce-stirred bark—the only one— Almost as still, on that still tide, As unrocked cradle by her side. Bland omen doth that vessel bring; “As smoothly sails his vessel now;” Then mark how hope and fondness cling Around the elder maiden's brow, The while on that sweet younger thing, Too young to frame itself a vow, The mother thoughtful hand doth lay, And timely teacheth how to pray. As homeward now their way they trace, Their bosoms own no anxious smart; For they have seen that blessed face, And know how She can calm impart, Who, tho' in heaven's supremest place, Bears as on earth a woman's heart; And know that She will guard him—She— Mother of Him, who walked the sea! And if, at last, those hopes deceive, Yet be our reasoning scorn represt: Nay, since 'tis sweet to those who grieve To dream of comfort and of rest, Dissuade not, if they do believe, And, leaning on that Mother blest, Link earth below to heaven above By tender ties of human love. THE STREAMS. Two streams there were, two streams from separate founts, Both beautiful to see, and one—most holy; (From Siloa this, and this from Hippocrene) Together onward flowing, side by side, Through the mind's region. And on either marge Of either stream were frequent altars reared, Accordant with the Genius of each wave, Or sacred or profane. Less solemn these— As if for festal rites ordained, and dight With sculptured attributes—for so they showed— Of lighter faith; or Cupid's torch or Hymen's, Or thyrsus bound with ivy; while beside Their white reliefs sleek kid or heifer stood With gilded horns, and neek by graceful hand Of priestess wreathed with flowers; the which—for dew— Trembled with ruby drops, caught as they sparkled From full libations of outgushing wine. Those other altars were beheld to rise Of a severer beauty; their sole symbol— The Saving Cross! their only sacrifice— A contrite heart, and prayers not scorned in heaven! Yet though each separate source, of false or true, Sped its own oracles, which—rightly read— Were of no balanced weight; yet still on each Waited the Duties and the Charities, Which soften or control our human heart. And ministered to each its clustering Graces, (Or classic called, or by more sacred name) These, truly, of a looser zone, while Those Stood by in matron-robe more strict. Nor lacked To each its Muses—its delightful Muses! For while beside one wave were heard sweet sounds From the Eolian lyre or Theban flute, Linking fresh sweetness to sweet ode or hymn; Pealed o'er that other such high strains as erst Broke forth in Judah from the passionate hand Of Prophet-King—praise—or victorious song— Or deep repentings—on the ten-stringed harp Made vocal, then; but well consorted, now, With the far-reaching organ, as it triumphed O'er the full choir; or with some single voice Mingled its milder notes. Those varying strains To hear; amid those varying groups of beauty To stray, and learn what sage or prophet taught, From every clime thronged vota'ries; and, in sooth, Most sweet and profitable had it been To wander 'mid the far-stretched lawns, which opened Between those sidelong waters, and to quaff From each in turn—worshipping at the one. But so it was—the simple truth to tell— The livelier flow of that less holy river, And lighter Muses, and more pliant Graces, Won to its careless marge the larger throng; Still won; and oft, in their own reason's spite, Amid its open Grecian colonnades Kept lingering; of those graver Gothic fanes, High arched, and dim, and of mysterious power, Neglectful. And so 'twas till all had reached To where those streams flowed round each side the hill, “Which stands midway in this our mortal life Cary's Dante..” From that hill-top the backward-looking eye Could track the livelier and the calmer currents E'en to the distant cliffs, whence first they fell; But to the forward sight—changed was the scene. For while the course of that serener wave Held onward, through mild landscape, to the view Interminable, this from Hippocrene, Not far below the base of that mid hill, With sudden plunge flung itself under ground, And, as it parted, sounded sad farewell! Then, 'mid the votaries of the vanished stream, Its lovers, with a too-exclusive love, Were cheated looks and strange perplexities, And sorrow; and, worse than sorrow, desperate mirth! Some at their own loss jested recklessly, Till came a Power, and bade them jest no more! Some wandered, seeking; some, disputing, sat; And, 'mid their seekings and disputings, died! While fiercer bloods, impatient of the Present, Which mated all too poorly with the Past, And the' enigmatic Future hot to know, With their own sudden swords resolved the riddle. So fared it with the' unwise. The wiser part Paused not, but turned them sideway to the marge Of that, till now, less-heeded stream, and found it Such as might win a will all free to choose. More calm, perchance, than e'en when first they knew it, And therefore to maturer choice more kin; And if more deep, more clear; and, as more clear, Adding fresh loveliness to earth, and still With surer certitude reflecting heaven. Soon won the yielding heart a kindred calm From that calm stream; with hopes, bright as the flowers Which bloomed around. For flowers were blooming round; Some—new to knowlege; of perennial odours, And all undying hues; thither, no doubt, From Paradise transplanted. Some they knew, If less enduring, yet almost as fair, For dwellers on that Gentile-stream; nor scorned Their presence here; nay, gathered thence sweet memories Of many a joy once quaffed from Hippocrene, With this their deeper bliss from Siloa's source To mingle, as those flowers together mingled. And feeding thus on old remembrances, And joys at hand, and hopes more blissful still, They followed the on guiding wave to where Silent it lapsed into the fated sea, Which all must voyage o'er. Nor ended here The bliss. For by the shore rode anchored barks, (Not by such fabled forms as Charon old, But by Angelic Natures piloted,) The' awaiting pilgrims o'er its rough or smooth (For not to all the passage was the same) Safely to waft; while from that very shore All might behold what lovely regions rose Beyond in the horizon; fair as clouds, The fairest ever hung in western sky, But not like them to fade; eternal dwellings Of Spirits who had passed, and landed there!</field>
