Higgaion twice, Psal. 9. 17 &amp; 92. 4. Observance of the Acrostich Psalmes. Psalme 1. Beatus Vir. 1 Blest is the man, whose walks are cleer from wicked counsells aire; To sinners way who stands not neer, nor sits in scorners chaire. 2 But on the Law of God doth ground the life of his delight; And in those holy Precepts bound his practice day and night. 3 And like the planted tree, that lives the rills of water neere, His fruit as duely forth he gives in season of the yeere. His leafe, shall neither times decayes, nor tempests blast suppresse; So whatsoever he essaies, shall sort to good successe. 4 Not so, not so, the wicked race, they, like the chaffe shall thrive, Which from the earths offended face the winds before them drive. 5 Therefore shall not the wicked stocke in judgement stand upright; Nor with the just the sinfull flocke their guilty heads unite. 6 For how the Just their journie lay, the Lord their Leader knowes: But wicked doers, with their way, destruction overthrowes. Psal. 2. Quare fremuerunt? 1 Why doe the Heathen-pow'rs, and people entertaine; The Heathens, such tumultuous rage, the people, plots so vaine? 2 Kings of the earth conspire, and Princes counsell take Against the Lord, against his Christ, a powerfull head to make. 3 In sunder let us breake their servile bands (say they) Their yoke from off our neckes discharge, and cast their cords away. 4 But Hee, in Heaven above that sits, and sees their pride, Shall laugh their vanities to scorne, the Lord shall them deride. 5 To them then shall he speake, in his resistlesse ire; And their affrighted soules shall feele his furie burne like fire. 6 Yet, mine Annointed King upon mine holy Hill, Upon Mount Zion have I set. I shall declare the will, 7 Of which Decree the Lord hath given the charge to mee: And said, Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten Thee. 8 Aske, I to thee will give the Heathens world of ground For thine inheritance, possesse as farre as earth hath bound. 9 Thou with an iron rod shalt stripe their stubborne hides; Or, like a Potters brittle shards, in pieces dash their sides. 10 Now then, O Kings, be wise, and ye that judge the Land, Be well instructed what ye judge, judge what ye understand. 11 Serve ye the Lord in feare, in feare and joy betwixt; A joyfull feare, a trembling joy, delight and dutie mixt. 12 Embrace and kisse the Sonne, lest through your cold delay, His wroth contemning your contempt, ye perish in the way. If but a little while his anger'd patience burne; For safety they that hope in Him, have all a happy turne. Psal. 3. Domine, quid. Psalmus David. cùm fugeret à facie Absalom, filii sui. 1 How many my distressers, Lord, what mighty enemies: Against one harmlesse head of mine how many heads arise? 2 A multitude say of my soule, so helplesse left alone, Himselfe he cannot help, in God for him there health is none. Selah 3 But thou my shield about me, Lord, dost for my glory stand; The sole up-lifter of my head is thy Almighty hand. 4 Up to the Lord I strain'd my voice, and cri'd, that he might heare; And he out of his holy Mount to my complaint gave eare. Selah 5 I laid me downe and slept; from sleep refresht I rose againe: My sleep was sound, my guard was safe, the Lord did me sustaine. 6 Beleaguer'd with ten thousand strong in armes, about me laid; And malice equall to their might, I would not be affraid. 7 Rise up, Lord, save me, O my God, for thy revengefull stroke Of all my wicked foes the jawes and ranck'rous teeth hath broke. 8 Salvation is of thee, O Lord, from thee the blessing flowes, Which on thy chosen peoples heads thy bounteous hand bestowes. Selah Psal. 4. Cùm invocarem. Ad Præstantem in Neghinoth: Psalmus David. 1 To thee, O God, my righteousnesse, let my complaint repaire: Thou hast enlarg'd mee from distresse, in mercie heare my praier. 2 My glorie (sonnes of man) to shame how long will ye apply? Your love shall vanitie enflame, your labour seeke a lye. Selah 3 But know, that of his gracious Saint the Lord makes wondrous choice; And when to him I make my plaint, the Lord will heare my voice. 4 Be angry: but from sinne refraine, Soule, with a silent zeale: Selah 5 Thy selfe upon thy bed arraigne, and to thy selfe reveale. 6 The sacrifices ye present, let Justice sacrifice; And let your hope be confident, that on the Lord relies. 7 Of good (say many) is there none will shew us any sight? On us, Lord (all our good in one) lift up thy faces light. 8 Pure joy into this heart of mine so shalt thou give me, more Than theirs, that of their corne and wine in harvest heap up store. 9 My head then downe will I both lay, and sleep in peaces cell: For thou alone, O Lord, my stay, in safetie mak'st me dwell. Psal. 5. Verba mea. Ad Præstantem, super Nehiloth. Psalmus David. 1 Unto my words, O Lord, give eare, weigh well my wordlesse thought: 2 O let my crie, where thou maist heare, my King, my God, be brought. 3 Thou, Lord, shalt (early) heare my voice, to thee my praier shall flie: And of the rising morne make choice to Heaven to raise mine eie. 4 For thou art God, in wickednesse that takest no delight: The evill shall have no accesse, nor sojourne in thy sight. 5 Vain-glorious Fooles before thine eyes take footing never shall: Thou hatest of iniquities the painfull workers all. 6 The lying tongue shalt thou defeat with utter overthrow: The man of blouds, and pale deceit, the Lord abhorres to know. 7 But in thy mercies much regard, thy house will I draw neere; And to thy holy Temple-ward, doe worship in thy feare. 8 Lord, lead me in thy justice right: and, lest I step astray, Because of my maligners, straight before me make thy way. 9 For in his mouth, no truth sincere, their inwards, deeps of woe: Their throat, an open sepulchre; tongues smoothly taught to goe. 10 Judge them, O God, and let their fall, their guilty counsells tell: Rout them with their transgressions all, against thee that rebell. 11 So shall they (aye) that trust in thee, shout all with joyfull voice; And thy Names-lovers, they that be, for covering them, rejoyce. 12 For thou, O Lord, thy blessing downe upon the Just shalt yeeld; And with thy gracious favour crowne his head, as with a shield. Psal. 6. Domine, ne in furore. Ad Præstantem, in Neghinoth, super Octavam. Psalmus David. 1 My faults, let no reproofe of thine, Lord, in thy wrath repeat; Nor chastise any crime of mine in thy displeasures heat. 2 Have mercy, Lord; for I am weake, Lord, heale me: else in vaine My bones, with horrour shook, shall speake the language of my paine. 3 My soule is also troubled sore; and though my pangs be strong, My soule-sicke sorrow paines me more, but Thou, O Lord, how long! 4 Returne, O Lord, and at thy cost my soules deliverance cleere: O save my life, that am but lost, but for thy mercie meere. 5 For none in death remembrance have upon thy Name to dwell: And who so thankfull in the grave, as of thy praise to tell? 6 The languor that my groanes have bred, my melting spirits out-weares: To swimme all night I make my bed, and drowne my couch in teares. 7 Mine eye gnawne out with anguish dies, my beautie to behold, (Because of all mine enemies) growne wanne, and waxen old. 8 From mee, ye wicked doers all, with all your deeds forbeare: The Lord hath heard my voices call, my teares have touch't his eare. 9 The Lord hath heard how I complain'd, and with my praier is pleas'd; My suit the Lord hath entertain'd, my painfull suffrings eas'd. 10 Shame and confusion out of hand on all my haters light: And on their backes entrench the brand of their reproachfull flight. Psal. 7. Domine Deus. Shiggajon David, qui cecinit Domino, super verba Chus, filii Jemini. 1 My confidence doe I repose O Lord my God in thee: From all my persecuting foes save and deliver mee. 2 Lest like a Lion he devoure, and (no Redeemer neere To rescue me that hath the power) my soule in pieces teare. 3 O Lord my God, if I have done this crime that they object; Or wickednesse if any one my guilty palmes infect. 4 If evill I to him have paid, that was with mee at peace: (Yea, him that causlesse me betrai'd I freely did release:) 5 Let then my foe pursue, and take my soule to sate his lust; Tread downe my life on earth; and make my glorie dwell in dust. Selah 6 Rise up Lord in thy wrath, up rise, for my distressors rage; Command thy judgement to surprize, or their proud heat asswage. 7 So shall the peoples many a one in flockes about thee flie: For their sakes to thy powerfull Throne returne thy selfe on hie. 8 The Lord shall judge the peoples right, judge Lord of my desert, How just my hands are in thy sight, and how sincere my heart. 9 Of wicked men the malice bound, the just establisht keep: For thou of hearts and reines dost sound (just God) the deepest deep. 10 My shield on God their Saviour, that are in heart upright: Just Judge is God; Gods angry power threats every day to light. 11 For him that turnes not; to repent whom no remorse will bring, His sword he whets, his bow stands bent, his arrowes on the string. 12 And them for him he hath prepar'd, (dire instruments of death:) Among the persecutors shar'd, to stop their fierie breath. 13 Behold his wombe with mischiefe swells, with sorrow breeds he sin: Now brought to bed, of nothing else but of a lie, lies-in. 14 He digg'd a pit with painfull care, to delve it deep withall: Where (others earning to ensnare) himselfe into did fall. 15 His mischiefe on his head shall light, that mischiefe first did frame: On his owne pate shall spend his spight, the forge from whence it came. 16 Confesse unto the Lord will I, so just in all his waies; And of the Lord, that is Most-Hie, the Name my song shall praise. Psal. 8. Domine, Dominus. Ad Præstantem, super Gittith. Psalmus David. 1 O Lord, our Lord, the earth about how glorious is thy Name; Which hast thy Majestie given out above the Heavens high frame? 2 Strength from the mouth of babes to goe, from sucklings tender age, Thou foundedst, to confound the foe, and still th' avengers rage. 3 As oft as on thy Heav'ns I looke, worke of thy fingers rote; The Moon, the Starres, (Heav'ns Musick-book) by thee in Volumes wrote; 4 What is fraile man, O say I now, remembred thus by thee? Or what is Adams sonne, that thou his Visitor shouldst be? 5 A little hast thou rank't beneath the Angels Crest his Crowne: His head empal'd within a wreathe of glorie and renowne. 6 A Soveraigne hast thou set him, meet thy handy-workes to sway; And all things underneath his feet made usefull to obey. 7 Sheep, Oxen, all the Beasts that field or desert-soile containe: Fowle, Fish, that aire or salt-sea yeeld, whose pathes are in the Maine. 8 O Lord, our Lord, how excellent throughout this earthly frame! How boundlesse is the beames extent of thy resplendent Name! Psal. 9. Confitebor tibi. Ad Præstantem, super Muth-Labben. Psal. David. 1 To render thankes to thee, O Lord, my heart is wholly bent; Of all thy marvells to record, my tongue the instrument. 2 I will be glad, I will rejoyce in thee with melodie: And to thy Name sing Numbers choice, O thou that art Most-Hie. 3 When backward fled, mine enemies were hard pursu'd in chace; They stumbled, never more to rise, but perish from thy face. 4 For thou my judgements doome hast done, or else my right had fail'd: Thou satest Judge upon the Throne, where Justice hath prevail'd. 5 The Heathen routs hast thou reprov'd, the wicked one destroi'd; From men among, their name remov'd, for evermore made void. 6 My foe, see desolations done, the Cities raz'd to ground: With them is their memoriall gone, and in their dust lies drown'd. 7 But Soveraigne on his Throne declar'd the Lord shall ever sit; Which for himselfe he hath prepar'd, and made for judgement fit. 8 And he with justice will proceed to judge the world so wide; And of his peoples every deed with righteous doome decide. 9 The Lord to him that is opprest will be a refuge high: A refuge high, the poore distrest when times of trouble trie. 10 And they that know thy Name, alone their trust on thee will ground: For thou art, Lord, forsaking none of them that seeke thee, found. 11 Sing to the Lord on Sion Mount, whose pleasure is to dwell: With praise his deeds of high account among the peoples tell. 12 For when the Quest of his Assise for blouds inquirie makes: Unmindfull he the meeke that cries forgets not, nor forsakes. 13 My suffrings, Lord, in mercie see, through mine oppressors hates; Of death, O thou the onely He, that lifts me from the gates. 14 That all thy praises I may spread in Sions daughters ports; And in thy saving health be glad, in all my songs reports. 15 The Heath'n are sunke downe in the pit, which they themselves prepar'd: That secret net which they did fit, their foot hath fast ensnar'd. 16 His judgement done, the Lord is knowne to execute aright: Caught in the handy-workes his owne, mark well the wicked wight. Higgajon.Sel. 17 The wicked shall returne to Hell, where their abode is set: Where Heath'ns, &amp; Heav'ns-contemners dwell, and all that God forget. 18 For alwaies shall not be forgot the grievance of the poore; Of needy soules the hopes shall not be lost for evermore. 19 Rise, Lord, let none of mortall race prevaile against thy hand; But let the Heath'ns before thy face, to heare their judgement stand. 20 Dismaying-feare upon them throw, that Lord, confounded then, The haughty-hearted Heath'ns may know, they be but wretched men. Selah. Psal. 10. Ut quid Domine. 1 Why standst thou, Lord, so farre aside, when dangers draw so neere? Thy helpfull face why dost thou hide, when troublous times appeare? 2 The wicked in his heat of pride pursues the heart-lesse poore: In those selfe-toiles let them be ti'd, by them contriv'd before. 3 The wicked boasts his soules desires beyond his wisht successe: The covetous, what he admires, blasphemes the Lord to blesse. 4 On God (so proud the wicked is) he takes no care to call: Nor God in any plot of his hath any place at all. 5 His travell all times well succeeds, thy Judgements, where he goes, Above his sight he never heeds, but puffes at all his foes. 6 For in his hearts consent, he said, 'Mov'd shall I never be. On me shall evill none be laid, my fall no age shall see. 7 His mouth is full with curses arm'd, deceit and guile among: Iniquitie and mischiefe swarm'd, hive underneath his tongue. 8 In villages to stands he gets, there close in ambush lies: The innocent and poore besets, and murthers when he spies. 9 In secret, he from sight of men lies waiting, neere the way; And Lion-like lurkes in his den, to snatch the poore for prey. 10 The poore into his net he drawes, till he hath caught him thrall; Stoops low, into his powerfull pawes that poore by flockes may fall. 11 In heart he saies (tongue durst not say) “All this hath God forgot; Or heedlesse hides his face away for ever, sees it not. 12 Arise, Lord God, lift up thy hand for them, that help implore, Without thy strength too weake to stand, be mindfull of the poore. 13 Why hath the wicked heart a tongue, though words for feare retire; To speake in spitefull thoughts? “This wrong thou God wilt not enquire. 14 Thou seest, for wrong and wickednesse, thine eye and hand perceive: He dresse, the poore and fatherlesse to thee their helper leave. 15 Of wicked and malicious men breake thou the harmfull arme: Seeke out his wickednesse, and then find neither arme nor harme. 16 The Lord is King and Governour, for ever and beyond: The Heath'n opposers of his power are perisht from the land. 17 The meek-afflicted soules desire thou Lord, art pleas'd to heare; Their heart confirm'd dost thou inspire, attentive mak'st thine eare. 18 To judge the pupill and the poore, that sorry man may find His daunting threats to be no more but earth, and empty wind. Psal. 11. In Domino. Ad Præstantem, Davidis. 1 My trust doth on the Lord relie, how say ye to my soule, Soule, to thy mountaines safetie flie, as swift as feathred fowle? 2 For loe, the wicked bend their bow, on string their arrow fit, A shoot in darknesse to bestow, the upright heart to hit. 3 When wicked plots are over-past, that stedfast ground have none: When their foundations downe are cast, the just, what hath he done? 4 The Lord from holy place above, the Lord from Heav'n his Throne, His eyes will view, his eye-lids prove how Adams sonnes have gone. 5 The just and wicked ones estate the Lord will prove and trie: 6 But selfe hate foules his soule doth hate, that love malignitie. 7 Upon the wicked will he showre snares, fire, and brimstone downe: And breath of burning tempest powre, their cup this lot shall crowne. 8 For just the Lord, and just designes are lovely in his sight; His face discerns, and right defines of men and meanes upright. Psal. 12. Salvum me fac. Ad Præstantem, super Octavam. Psalmus David. 1 Save, Lord, for godly men are gone, and goodnesse none that mind: Of Adams sonne a faithfull one example rare to find. 2 With faign'd discourse, and fawning style, each one his neighbour holds: But of his flatt'ring lips, the guile in heart and heart he molds. 3 All flatt'ring lips, of fraud the traine the Lord cut off betimes; And tongue that strikes no lower straine, but lofty language chimes. 4 Our tongue (say they) shall sure prevaile, these lips of ours must walke; Our lips their Masters must not faile: what Lord shall taxe our talke? 5 Now for the needy soules reprize, and poore mans groaning cares, Up will I, saith the Lord, arise, and save him from these snares. 6 Thy words, O Lord, are words as pure as silver seven times tri'd In Test of ashes, by the cure of fire repurifi'd. 7 Thou shalt, O Lord, preserve the flocke of thy selected sheep; And ever from this wicked stocke the soule that serves thee keep. 8 The wicked compasse every coast, their quarter keeps no bounds: While Adams sonnes are valew'd most, where vilenesse most abounds. Psal. 13. Usque quò Domine? Ad Præstantem. Psalmus David. 1 How long, Lord, wilt thou me forget? for ever shall it be? How long, no eye upon mee set, but hide thy face from me? 2 How long shall I in soule advise, and daily vexe my heart? How long, my foes above me rise, against me that take part? 3 Behold, O Lord my God, and heare from clouds of darknesse deep: With thy pure light mine eye-sight cleare, lest in the death I sleep. 4 Against me, lest to have prevail'd, my foe give out the voice: For when my feeble foot hath fail'd, my troublers will rejoyce. 5 My trust yet on thy mercie staies, thy saving health shall be My joy of heart, my song shall praise thy bounty, Lord, to mee. Psal. 14. Dixit Insipiens. Ad Præstantem, Davidis. 1 There is no God, the fooles heart sayes in his ungodly mood. 2 Corrupt and odious are their wayes: none, no not one does good. 3 The Lord look't downe from heaven, to see what Adams sonnes desir'd: Of understanding, who was hee, that after God enquir'd. 4 Together all departed are, all loathsome-sented grow'n: Of doing good that hath the care, or conscience none, not one. 5 Are wicked workers all mis-led? so ignorant are all? That eate my people up like bread, on God they never call. 6 There did their feare confesse distrust, whose guilt they could not hide; The generation of the Just hath God to be their guide. 7 The counsells of the poore, to blame your blame-full counsells rend: And (shamelesse) of his hopes, speake shame, that on the Lord depend. 8 Salvation who to Israel shall out of Sion give, When they that now in bondage dwell, no longer captives live. 9 When home-return'd the Lord shall bring the people of his choice, O then for joy shall Jacob sing, and Israel rejoyce. A Paulo recitantur hoc ordine.Isti tres versus non sunt in textu Hebræo, Græco, Chaldæo, vel in Carmine Apollinarii. In Bibliis emendatis relicti sunt, ob antiquitatis venerationem: sed absque arithmetica nota, qui ut proprii distinctique hujus Psalmi versus habeantur. 1 Their throat an open sepulchre, the forge of fraud their tongue: Their lips more deadly poyson beare, than where the Aspe hath stung. 2 Their mouth of cursing is a spring, of bitternesse a floud: Their feet as fowle of prey on wing are swift in shedding bloud. 3 Their waies are for vexation made, and to destruction lead: The way of peace is not their trade, nor know they how to tread. 4 Which knowing not, needs must they fall, where endlesse horrour lies, Of God that have no sense at all, no feare before their eies. Psal. 15. Domine, quis? Psalmus Davidis. 1 Who, Lord, shall sojourne in thy Tent? Inhabit who thy holy Hill? Who perfect walkes, is working still 2 The workes of Justice to fulfill; In heart meanes truth; truth speakes as ment. 3 Whose tongue to slander cannot frame, Doth to his friend no evill thing, Nor gives nor takes reproaches sting, From mischiefes venom'd mouth to fling, Against his neighbours honest name. 4 Whose eye (all kind respect forgot) Holds in contempt a person vile; But rankes them high in honours file, To feare the Lord, that set their while: Sweares to his hurt, and changeth not. 5 Gives not to biting Usurie, For sordid gaine, his silver lent, Sells not for bribe the innocent; To do these things whose mind stands bent, Shall stand unmov'd eternally. Psal. 16. Conserva me. Michtam Davidis. 1 On thee my safeties hope is staid O God, preserve thou me: 2 Thou Lord, my Lord (my soule hath said) My good is not to thee. 3 Upon the Saints on earth that dwell, soules gracious in thy sight: Soules, that in serving God excell, set is my sole delight. 4 Their sorrowes shall be multipli'd, that after off-gods runne; That other god have deifi'd, and left thy dues undone. Of bloud the offerings they propine, I will not once partake, Nor of their names these lips of mine shall ever mention make. 5 The Lord is of mine heritage the portion, of my cup The over-flowing beverage; my lot thou holdest up. 6 Within a faire and pleasant land, the lines for mee are laid: A goodly heritage in hand, I hold to mee convai'd. 7 Thankes to the Lord will I returne for his advertisement, Whose fire within my reines doth burne, with nightly chastisement. 8 The Lord before mee alwaies set my object un-reprov'd; On my right hand so him I get, I shall not be remov'd. 9 My heart therefore thus heartned, sung for joy within my brest: Glad was the glory of my tongue, “My flesh in hope shall rest. 10 Nor wilt thou leave my soule in hell, nor give thy Holy One, Where death, and shades of darknesse dwell, to see corruption. 11 The path of life thou mak'st mee know, full joyes before thy face: From whence perpetuall pleasures flow, thy right hand is the place. Psal. 17. Exaudi, Domine. Oratio Davidis. 1 Heare justice, Lord, exactly heed what my loud cries entreat; Attend my praier, that doth proceed from lips without deceit. 2 My judgement from before thy face let come in open sight: Let thy pure eies discerne my case, and give the Rights their right. 3 My heart by night thy search did sound, yet nothing didst thou find That with my mouth I did propound, to sinne against my mind. 4 By workes, that earthly man concerne, I find what course they runne: By thy lips word, the pathes I learne of breakers-through to shunne. 5 Beat thou my waies, and make them plaine, my feeble steps fore-guide; My feet within thy pathes containe, my footing shall not slide. 6 On thee I call, thou God wilt heare, and answer mee againe: To my request incline thine eare, attend how I complaine. 7 Thy wondrous mercies set apart, from thy insulting foes, Saviour of them, whose hope thou art, that thy right hand oppose. 8 O keep me as those chrystall globes, the eyes black darling keep, And spread thy wings wide covering robes, where shadow'd I may sleep. 9 My head from wicked faces hide, the heads of my decay, That compasse me on every side, to make my soule their prey. 10 Enclos'd in their owne fat, they smoake with surfeits doubtfull sweat; And with their mouth have proudly spoke their haughty hearts conceit. 11 To snare our footsteps, in our walkes they now beset us round, With eyes (as treason closely stalkes) to undermine our ground. 12 His likenesse is a Lion bold, that greedy is to teare; So keeps the Lions whelp his hold, that lurkes in secret where. 13 Rise, Lord, prevent his sharp fore-sights, to stop my foe begin; And with thy sword, wherewith he fights, my soules deliverance win. 14 From men, the scourge Lord of thy hand, from mortall-worldlings will; Upon this life, whose portions stand, whose gorge thy treasures fill! Sonnes have they store; and of their store, when death shall them bereave: Then (all too much) what they have more, they to their children leave. 15 Now of thy face a view to take, shall Justice be my guide: In mee when shall thine Image wake, I shall be satisfi'd. Psal. 18. Diligam te, Domine. Ad Præstantem. Servi Domini Davidis, qui loquutus est Domino verba Cantici hujus, in die quo eripuit eum Dominus de volâ omnium inimicorum suorum, &amp; de manu Saul: Et dixit, 1 O Lord, whose strength in mee doth move, and all my strength beget, The strong impression of my love on thee is wholly set. 2 The Lord my rocke, whereon to build, my sort, my Saviour: My God, my hopes strong hold, my shield, horne of my health, my towre. 3 Upon the praised Lord I call'd, to him for help I prai'd; Mee from my foes he dis-enthrall'd, and gave mee saving aide. 4 Of death the sorrowes succourlesse were round about mee laid; Of over-bearing wickednesse the flouds made me affraid. 5 The cords of Hell about mee bent, on every side tooke hold; The snares of death did mee prevent, that I could not unfold. 6 Opprest, the Lord my God I prest, he from his Palace heares; Before him came my loud request, and entred at his eares. 7 Then shook the trembling earth for feare, the hills foundations mov'd: And at his presence troubled were, because his wroth reprov'd. 8 A storme of smoake before him came, which from his nostrils fum'd; And fire out of his mouth did flame, that where it came, consum'd. 9 He bow'd the Heav'ns, and made his Throne with earth his foot-stoole meet: Beneath the dreadfull light that shone, lay darknesse at his feet. 10 A Cherub-chariot did him beare, whose plumes he made his saile; The winds his winged-coursers were, and darknesse was his vaile. 11 Darke his pavillion, darke the skie, darke waters, duskie clouds, Compose an aërie canopie, wherein himselfe he shrowds. 12 The brightnesse of his presence tooke the melting clouds in chace; With haile and coales hot-burning strooke, they fled before his face. 13 The Lord from Heav'n in thunder spoke; his voice that is most-Hie, With stormes of haile made earth to smoake, and coales of fire to flie. 14 His sheafs of arrowes forth he sent, which at the scatt'red, flew: Of lightning-shot his vollies spent, downe his resisters threw. 15 The channels of the Maine appeare, the worlds foundations vast, At thy rebuke discovered were, Lord, at thy nostrils blast. 16 He sent his hand from Heav'n above, to bay the waves that flew; He tooke mee, and from out the drove of many waters drew. 17 He freed mee from my strongest foe, to whom my strength was small: And from my mighty haters, moe than I could match withall. 18 When I with woe was over-gone, they mee fore-laid that day; But mee, then helper having none, the Lord my staffe did stay. 19 Where I was bound he brought mee forth enlarg'd, and set mee free: For (of mine owne) none other worth, but his delight in mee. 20 According as my justice stands, the Lord did mee reward; And to the purenesse of my hands, my recompence he shar'd. 21 Because what waies the Lord did goe, therein my feet have trod; And have not, as the wicked doe, departed from my God. 22 For all his Judgements in my sight, my guides before mee lay; And from mee his Decrees upright, I did not turne away. 23 So thus with him was I sincere, and held integritie; Restrain'd my selfe with hand severe, from mine iniquitie. 24 Just therefore, as my Justice stands, the Lord to mee supplies: Rewards the purenesse of my hands in his pure-sighted eies. 25 Thou to the mercifull wilt shew how mercifull thou art: Thy strong perfections make him know that is of perfect heart. 26 So with the pure to be as pure, thy selfe thou wilt reveale; And with the froward wilt be sure as frowardly to deale. 27 Thus wilt thou save from overthrow poore peoples miserie; And strike the eyes of pride as low, as they have look't too hie. 28 My candle thou shalt surely light; this darksome night of mine, The Lord my God shall make as bright as lightsome day to shine. 29 By thee have I dismai'd an host, and broken through them all; And by my God, where danger most might skare mee, scal'd the wall. 30 The way of God is perfect ground, the Word of Jah is tri'd; To all a shield of safetie found, whose hopes on him reside. 31 For who is God, the Lord except! Who is a Rocke of Might! Say (ye that have to Idols crept) and give our God his right. 32 The God that girdeth mee with strength, is he that is my stay; And he through all my journies length, that perfect gives my way. 33 He makes my feet as swift as Hinds, to follow, or to flie: He makes me stand, as fit he finds, upon my places hie. 34 My hands to warre he doth frequent, and weapons learnes to feele: These armes of mine to bend, and bent, to breake a bow of steele. 35 On me the shield of saving health thou hast vouchsaf'd to beat: Thy right hand hath upheld my wealth, thy meeknesse made mee great. 36 Beneath my feet thou didst enlarge my pathes on every side: And of my footsteps took'st such charge, my ankles should not slide. 37 Mine enemies have I pursu'd, and overtooke in flight, And not return'd, till I subdu'd, and ruin'd them outright. 38 With wounds I stunn'd them in such wise, that now to stand unmeet: Nor ever able more to rise, they fell beneath my feet. 39 For thou with strength hast girt my side, in battell to oppose, And under foot to tread their pride, against mee that uprose. 40 Thou, of my foes to mee hast brought the neckes, that under yoke I might cut off, and bring to nought my haters at a stroke. 41 In their distresse for help they cri'd, but none there was to save: Even to the Lord, but none repli'd, and he no answer gave. 42 Small as the dust before the wind them did I peace-meale beate; And them like out-cast rubbish grinde, that strewes the myrie street. 43 From people with contentions fed thou hast delivered me; And of the Heath'ns hast made me head, by strangers serv'd to be. 44 To mee, at hearing of the eare, obedient shall they sit: And to my power, dissembling feare, the forraigne shall submit. 45 The strangers sonnes shall shrinke away, their falsers hearts shall faile; And in their holds affraid to stay, their closets make their Jaile. 46 Let live the Lord, my Rocke be blest, He that my head did raise, The God in whom my health doth rest, exalted be with praise. 47 My praise of God the Powerfull sings, avenger of my wrongs; That under my subjection brings the headlesse peoples throngs. 48 He from my foes in safetie led, and left mee free to stand; Above my Rivals rais'd my head, rid from the Tyrants hand. 49 To thee therefore will I give thanks, O Lord, and praises frame, Among the Heathens thickest rankes, to sing unto thy name. 50 His Kings salvations great, he makes for ever to succeed; On his Annointed mercie takes, on David and his seed. Psal. 19. Cœli enarrant. Victori, Psalmus David. 1 The glorie of the God of Heaven, the Heav'ns of God declare: The Firmament firme proofe hath given, his handy-worke they are. 2 Day unto day delivereth speech in times alternate lines; And night to night doth knowledge teach, whose light in darknesse shines. 3 No speech, no language like their owne, to make their meaning found: Their voicelesse voice all eares have knowne, all heard their soundlesse sound. 4 Through all the earth their line is runne, their words the world about: A Tabernacle for the Sunne in them hath he set out. 5 Which, like a Bride groome, brightly clad, leaves his retiring place; And Giant-like, with gesture glad, sets forth to runne his race. 6 His beames from Heavens, each Signe &amp; Syde their oblique round repeat; And none there is himselfe can hide from his life-breathing heat. 7 Much more the Law of Jah is pure, the soule re-purifies Of Jah the Testimonie sure, and makes the simple wise. 8 The Statutes of the Lord upright, the heart with joy suffice: The Lords Commandment pure, gives light to soule-dark-sighted eies. 9 The reverend feare of Jah from staine stands chaste, and cleane for ever: Of Jah the Judgements truth containe, just are they altogether. 10 To be desired more than gold, than much fine gold they are: No honey-drops the combe can hold, for sweetnesse may compare. 11 Moreover, is thy servant taught by their admonishing, Observing them, but as they ought, how much reward they bring. 12 His errours who so wisely heeds, to understand them all? O cleanse mee from my close misdeeds, my secret faults let fall. 13 And let thy servants pride-swolne sinnes get no predominance: Thus innocence perfection wins, made cleane from much offence. 14 What I by word of mouth record, or meditate in mind: My Rocke and my Redeemer, Lord, with thee let favour find. Psal. 20. Exaudiat te Dominus. Ad Præstantem, Psalmus Davidis. 1 The day that troubles thee assaile, the Lord to thee replie: The Name of Jacobs God prevaile, to set thee up on hie. 2 Help from the Sanctuary send, thy strong up-holder stand: And out of Sion thee defend from thy distressors hand. 3 Remember all thine offerings past, thy sacrifices burne: His fire upon thy fatlings cast, and them to ashes turne. Selah. 4 He give to thee thy hearts desire, accomplish't at thy will: Thy counsell with his Spirit inspire, thy purpose all fulfill. 5 In thy salvation will we shout, triumphant Banner spread; And of our God the Name set out, “Thy suits the Lord bestead. 6 Now will the Lord himselfe, I know, for his Annointed stand: Heare from his holy Heavens, let flow health from his strong right hand. 7 Some men their trust in Chariots frame, on Horses some, to set: But of the Lord our God the Name we never shall forget. 8 They fall'n are, with the earth laid even, we rais'd, stand upright all: Save, Lord, and heare us King of Heaven, what day on thee we call. Psal. 21. Domine, in virtute. Ad Præstantem. Psalmus Davidis. 1 Lord, of thy strength with cheerfull voice, the King shall gladly tell; And in thy saving health rejoyce, with joy that shall excell. 2 The fulnesse of his hearts desire, to him thou hast suppli'd; And what his lips could but require, thy love hath not deni'd. Selah. 3 With blessings dost thou him prevent, thy goodnesse to unfold: And to empale his head, hast sent a Crowne of purest gold. 4 He ask't thee lifes, and thou didst give above, before his vow; Beyond the length of daies, to live for ever, didst allow. 5 In thy salvations sure supply great is his glorie growne: High Honour, Soveraigne Majestie, hast thou upon him throw'n. 6 Of blessings ever-flowing streames to him thou didst impart; And with thy countenances beames rejoyce his royall heart. 7 For to the Lord the King is nighest, by settled trust approv'd; And through the mercie of the Highest, he shall not be remov'd. 8 For all thy foes, soever where, thy hand shall search about; And them that hate against thee beare, thy right hand shall find out. 9 Make like a fierie oven their pow'r, what time thy face shall fume: Them shall the Lord in wrath devoure, the fire shall them consume. 10 The fruit of their untimely breed, from earth thou shalt destroy, That with the sonnes of men, their seed no memorie enjoy. 11 For mischiefe they against thee meant, with purpose to prevaile; And evill was their slie intent, but they shall not but faile. 12 For thou shalt set them as a Butt, and backe with shame them send; And on thy string thine arrowes put, against their faces bend. 13 Lord, in thy strength thy selfe up-raise, whose strength is all thine owne; So shall our songs extoll thy praise, and make thy power be knowne. Psal. 22. Deus meus. Victori, super Cervam Auroræ. Psal. David. 1 My God, my God, my strength alone, “Why dost thou mee forsake; And from my health so farre art gone, from these loud moanes I make? 2 My God, by day to thee I call, by day thou answerest not: By night no ceasing, silence all my groanings have forgot. 2 But thou continu'st Holy still, thy Holinesse doth dwell, Where praises on thy holy Hill are sung by Israel. 4 On thee their hopes our Fathers cast, and thou hast made them good: In thee they trusted, and thou hast their safe-deliverer stood. 5 To thee they cri'd, and at their cry by thee delivered were: In thee they trusted stedfastly, and no reproach did beare. 6 But I, a wretched worme, forlorne, a name from men exempt: Of earthly men becom'n the scorne, the peoples base contempt. 7 All they that see mee thus bestead, in mock'rie on mee play: Shoot out the lip, and shake the head, and in derision say, 8 “He to the Lord did recommend his trust, to be redeem'd: Let him to him deliverance send, whom his delight esteem'd. 9 Forth from the wombe thou didst me draw, where cloistred I did rest; Thou to my hopes becam'st a law upon my mothers brest. 10 I was commended to thy hands, cut from the navils hold: Thou art my God, since me in bands my mothers womb did fold. 11 O goe not therefore farre from hence, for troubles neere mee presse: And none there is in my defence to stand for my redresse. 12 Whole heards of bullockes, hoofe and head, are round about me set: Strong Bulls in Bashan, highly fed, to compasse mee are met. 13 Their throates tooth-weapon'd, two-leav'd doores, upon mee straine their jawes: Right so the Lion ramps and roares, on prey to seaze his pawes. 14 Like waters am I shed and sunk, my bones disparted all: My heart amidst my bowels shrunk, like molten waxe doth fall. 15 Dri'd like a pot-sheard is my strength, my tongue and jawes fast glew'd: And thou hast brought mee downe at length, where dust and death conclude. 16 A wicked crew of dogges compos'd, did round about mee meet: And Lion-like they me enclos'd, “They pierc't my hands and feet. 17 My bones I tell how many are, sharp lookes at mee they shot. 18 My garments they among them share, and for my coat cast lot. 19 But doe not thou farre off at need thy selfe, O Lord, absent: To help me from their hands, with speed them, O my strength, prevent. 20 My soule, whom deadly foes withstand, let not the sword devoure: Redeem my dearling from the hand, whereof the Dogge hath power. 21 O from the Lions mouth, now, then, my humbled head set free: From hornes of Unicornes, as when thou heardst and answeredst mee. 22 So then my brethren all among thy Name will I declare; Amidst the congregations throng, to sing thy praise prepare. 23 O praise him, ye that feare the Lord, ye seed of Jacob tell His glorie: all his feare record, ye seed of Israel. 24 For he hath not despis'd, nor loath'd the needy unsuppli'd: Nor with a veile his visage cloth'd, but heard him when he cri'd. 25 The great Assemblies solemne day, my praise shall sing of thee: My vowes to him that I will pay, shall they that feare him see. 26 The meeke shall eate, and be suffic'd, praise they to him shall give That seeke the Lord; thus exercis'd, your heart shall ever live. 27 All coasts on earth their hearts call home, and to the Lord restore; And all the Nations kindreds come his presence to adore. 28 For in the Lord, the soveraigne power of Royaltie remaines: And he the Lord and Governour among the Nations raignes. 29 The fat on earth shall eate and bend, before the food of grace: And all that downe to dust descend, shall bowe before his face. The Potentate, the poore that eate, shall life by eating have; With him, whose soules unquickned heat is yeelding to the grave. 30 A seed of theirs there shall succeed, his service to embrace: Which to the Lord shall be decreed, and reckoned for a race. 31 When they shall come, his righteousnesse then shall their tongues declare; To people after-borne expresse, that these his doings are. Psal. 23. Dominus regit. Psalmus Davidis. 1 My Shepheard is the Lord, whose care provides mee fold and food: Whose goodnesse plenteous, and to spare, supplies my want of good. 2 In pastures green he makes mee lye, and softly lodge my side: He leads mee forth, where pleasantly the streames of stillnesse glide. 3 He doth returne my soule againe, and for his owne Names sake, Conducts mee through the beaten plaine, that Justice treads to make. 4 Walk't I the shady Vale of death, none evill would I feare: Thy rod, thy staffe, relieve my breath, for thou art with mee there. 5 My table spread dost thou appoint in presence of my foes: My head with oile thou dost annoint, my chalice over-flowes. 6 With goodnesse sure shall mercie give an eye to all my waies; And in the Lords house shall I live, beyond the length of daies. Psal. 24. Domini est terra. Psalmus Davidis. 1 The earth, with all those mynes unfound, within her wombe that swell, Is all the Lords! the Worlds great round, and they that therein dwell. 2 He founded it upon the seas, and shor'd them under ground: Establish't fast the solid Leas, the liquid flouds to bound. 3 The Hill of Jah who shall ascend, so high to set his feet? Who in his holy place attend, for such a service meet? 4 He that cleane palmes, pure heart hath borne, his soule to vanitie Hath not up-lifted, hath not sworne an oath deceitfully. 5 He from the Lord on him bestow'd a blessing shall receive; And justice shall the mighty God of his salvation give. 6 Of them that seeke him, this the race, this Jacobs Israel: Of them that strive to seeke thy face, this Jacobs Peniel. Selah. 7 Lift up your heads, ye doores be rais'd, eternall gates give way, That enter, highly to be prais'd, the King of Glorie may. 8 Who is the King of Glorie? this, whose praises spread so farre? The strong and mighty Lord it is, the mighty Lord of warre. 9 Lift up your heads, ye doores be rais'd, eternall gates give way, That enter, highly to be prais'd, the King of Glorie may. 10 Who is the King of Glorie? this, of whom our praises sing? The Mighty Lord of hosts it is, of Glorie he is King. Selah. Psal. 25. Ad te, Domine. Davidis Acrostichon. 2 As, Lord, to thee I lift my soule, Because I trust in thee, My God: Let not confusion foule, nor foes insult on mee. 3 Give not their hopes, that thee attend, to take a shamefull staine: Let shame confound them that offend, and have no cause to faigne. 4 Direct mee, Lord, thy waies to know, thy pathes to mee make plaine: Within thy bounds my steps bestow, and teach mee to containe. 5 How in thy truth to tread impart, and make mee learne the way: For of my health the God thou art, whom I attend all day. 6 Zeale of thy kind compassions mind, remember, Lord, that care: Thy tender mercies make mee find, for they for ever are. 7 Hold, on my youthfull faults forepast, remember not to take; Of mercie mind how much thou hast, Lord, for thy goodnesse sake. 8 The Lord is good and righteous ey'd, transgressors to instruct: The sinners therefore will he guide, and in their way conduct. 9 In judgement just to tread upright, the humble he will stay: And where they wander, wanting light, will learne the meeke his way. 10 Continuall are the Lords pathes cast in Truths and Mercies mold; To such as keep his Covenant fast, his Testimonies hold. 11 Lord, to thy Names great power herein, let mee my pardon owe: And on the greatnesse of my sin thy greater mercie shew. 12 Make known the man with mind entire, that feares the Lord: the way That he shall choose he will inspire, and learne him how to lay. 13 Now (goodnesse gotten to his hand) his soule in good shall dwell: His seed inherit shall the land, that to his fathers fell. 14 Secret that from the Lord descends, doe they that feare him find: To such his Covenant he commends, and makes them know his mind. 15 On Jah-the-Lord mine eies are set continually to looke: To bring my feet out of the net, whose hand hath undertooke. 16 Prevent mee, and with gracious looke thy face on mee reflect: Whom solitary, poore, forsooke, (discomforts all) deject. 17 The sorrowes of my heart enlarg'd, my less'ned heart oppresse: O set mee from these toiles discharg'd, and free mee from distresse. 18 Remorse on mine afflictions cast, regard how much I grieve: Make even for all my faults fore-past, and all my sinnes forgive. 19 Regard my foes insatiate, what multitudes they lead, That beare a heart-infected hate against my harmlesse head. 20 Sustaine my helplesse soule alive, and safe deliver mee; But let not shame my fall contrive, because I trust in thee. 21 True perfectnesse and right let dwell with mee, that wait on thee: 22 Preserve, O God, thine Israel from all his troubles free. Psal. 26. Judica me, Domine. Davidis. 1 Judge mee, O Lord, I walke the way that perfectnesse doth guide: My trust upon the Lord I lay, and therefore shall not slide. 2 Examine, Lord, what I have been, sound what I ever did: Search out my reines, what there uncleane; my heart, what there lies hid. 3 Thy mercie is before mine eyes, thy truth my walkes repeat: 4 I sit not downe with men of lyes, nor enter with deceit. 5 The evill doers I eschew, their Synagogue I hate: Nor have I with the wicked crew in their Assembly sate. 6 My hands, Lord, wash't in innocence, thine Altar compast round: 7 With thankfull voice will I commence, thy wonders all to sound. 8 The habitation of thy House have I, O Lord, lov'd well: The place where thou art glorious, the house where I would dwell. 9 O gather not my soule, to rest where sinners soules abide: And on my life lay no inquest, where men of blouds are tri'd. 10 Whose hands accomplish wicked drifts, which mischiefes head contrives; And their right hand is full of gifts, whose bargaine Brib'rie drives. 11 Of this perfection I have got, however thou esteem; Yet my perfection urge I not, in mercie mee redeeme. 12 My foot upon so firme a ground stands stedfast and upright; That I, O Lord, thy praise will sound in great Assemblies sight. Psal. 27. Dominus, illuminatio. Davidis. 1 The Lord my Saviour is my light, of whom am I affraid? The Lord is of my life the might, by whom to be dismaid? 2 When wicked men with malice arm'd, my foes in furie fell, To eate my flesh, against mee swarm'd, they stumbled, and they fell. 3 Encamp't against mee, not an host should make my heart affraid; Should warlike troupes fill every coast, in this my trust is stai'd. 4 For one suit to the Lord I sue, his house for life to hold: Those beauties of the Lord to view, his Palace to behold. 5 For his Pavillion will he spread, in troublous time to hide; And on a rocke advance my head, in secret by his side. 6 Above my foes now round about, my head shall be up-rais'd: And Jah, with joy his tents throughout, in hosts and hymnes be prais'd. 7 Unto my voice, O Lord, give eare, upon thee when I call: And my request in mercy heare, but answer mee withall. 8 When, “Seeke my face thou saidst to mee, with ecchoing touch of grace, My heart advertis'd, answer'd thee, “Lord, I will seeke thy face. 9 Thy face from mee then doe not hide, thy seeker to defeat; Nor from thy servant turne aside, in thy displeasures heat. My succour (not to be forgot) thou hast been heretofore: God of my health, now leave mee not, forsake mee now no more. 10 Should mee my fathers wiser care, my mothers love forsake: Though she that bare mee, mee forbare, the Lord would mee up take. 11 Teach mee, O Lord, thy way to tread, where thy safe conduct lies; And in the path of Rightnesse lead, from my observers eies. 12 Give mee not to my foes desire, for falshoods evidence; With him against mee doth conspire, that breath's out violence. 13 As I beleev'd, so faith to mee did firme assurance give, The goodnesse of the Lord to see, within their land that live. 14 Attend the Lord with courage bold, be strong, and stay the end: Confirme thy heart to hold thy hold, upon the Lord attend. Psal. 28. Ad te Domine. Davidis. 1 On thee, O Lord my Rocke, I call, deafe-ceasing cease to be; Lest downe the pit, like them that fall, thy silence silence me. 2 The voice of my petitions heare, when for thy grace I cry: When to thy holy Adyte neere, I lift my hands on hie. 3 Draw mee not with the wicked sort, that worke with sinfull art, That to their neighbours peace report, but malice presse in heart. 4 Pay them what they to passe have brought, the evill they devis'd: And by the workes their hands have wrought, be their reward assiz'd. 5 Because what deeds the Lord hath done, his hand they will not heed: Downe shall he breake them every one, and build up no such breed. 6 Blest be the Lord, to whom I strain'd the voice of mine un-rest: Whose gracious eare hath entertain'd, and heard my whole request. 7 The Lord my strength is, and my shield, my hearts, my hopes successe: Joy to my heart, whose help doth yeeld, him shall my song confesse. 8 The Lord with strength doth still support the flocke that he enfolds; And of salvations is the Fort, that his Annointed holds. 9 O save the people of thy flocke, blesse thine inheritance; Feed them, and on thy favours rocke for ever them advance. Psal. 29. Afferte Domino. Psalmus Davidis. 1 Give to the Lord, ye men of Might, ye sonnes of Mighty race, Give glorie to the Lord, his right; all strength to his give place. 2 Give to the Lord his Names renowne before his holy Seat: Your selves unto the Lord bowe downe, his beauteous honour greet. 3 The voice that forth on waters breakes, it is the Lord that-bounds: The glorious God in thunder speakes, the Lord on seas re-sounds. 4 The Lord sends forth a mighty noise, when power his power withstands: The Lord gives out a soveraigne voice, when Majestie commands. 5 When lofty Cedars broken lie, his voice the Lord extends: Of Lebanon the Cedars high the Lord in sunder rends. 6 He makes them like a Heifer trip, proud of his velvet hornes; So Lebanon, so Shirion skip, so skip young Unicornes. 7 The Lords voice shoots out flames of fire, JAH'S voice the Desert shakes: 8 To tremble, if the Lord transpire, the Desert Cadesh makes. 9 JAH'S voice makes Hinds bring forth their young, the Forrest-brood makes bare: And in his Temple every tongue his glorie can declare. 10 The Lord sate Soveraigne, at the floud the Lord for ever raignes; For sinners judgement, for the good his Mercy-seat ordaines. 11 Strength to his people, their strong Rocke, the Mighty Lord will give: The blessing he will give his flocke, shall be in peace to live. Psal. 30. Exaltabo te, Domine. Psalmus Cantici: Dedicationis domus David. 1 I will extoll thee, Lord Most-Hie, so high-extoll'd by thee: That hast not left an enemie to triumph over mee. 2 Thee, Lord my God, my cry besought, thou heald'st mee instantly: 3 My soule from Hell thou Lord hast brought, reviv'd mee from-to-die. 4 O ye his Saints, the praises sing, that to the Lord belong: Before his holy presence bring a thanks-remembring song. 5 For but the twinkling of an eie his angers moment lasts: But life on fraile mortalitie his gracious favour casts. An evening weeping may out-weare, and teares with midnight mourne: But mirth at morning will appeare, and joy with light returne. 6 In my prosperitie I said, mov'd shall I never be. 7 My mountaine, Lord, so strongly laid, thy favour rais'd to me. Thy face from me yet didst thou hide, and I was troubled soone: 8 Then Lord to thee for grace I cri'd, to thee, Lord, made my moane. 9 What profit in my bloud can be, when I descend the pit? Shall dust to tender thankes to thee, or tell thy truth be fit? 10 Heare, Lord, of thee what I request, and mercy on mee take: O doe not mee that am distrest, my helper, Lord, forsake. 11 To joyfull dancing hast thou turn'd my sorrowes dolefull sound: My sack-cloth loos'd, wherein I mourn'd, with gladnesse girt mee round. 12 That so may my uncessant tongue, (my glory) tune thy praise: Thankes, Lord, to thee my God be sung, to endlesse length of daies. Psal. 31. In te Domine speravi. Ad Præstantem. Psalmus David. 1 My confidence on thee I ground, sham'd let mee never be: As Justice doth in thee abound, O Lord, deliver me. 2 Bowe downe thine eare, I may be heard, with speed on mee reflect: My rocke of strength, my house of guard, in safety mee protect. 3 For thou my rocke and fortresse tri'd, whatever path I tread, Wilt for thy Name sake be my guide, and all my footing lead. 4 To bring mee forth out of the net, for mee in secret laid, Thy force against their falshood set; thy strength is all my aide. 5 From death and deaths eternall bands, by thee redeem'd, my spirit, Doe I againe into thy hands, Lord God of truth, commit. 6 I hate them that observers are of lying vanities: My confidences settled care upon the Lord relies. 7 I will with glad and joyfull spleen thy mercies praise expresse: For my affliction hast thou seen, and knowne my soules distresse. 8 Nor hast thou shut me in the hand of my malignant foe; But for my feet made place to stand, and roome at large to goe. 9 On mee since yet distresse is drawne, let Lord thy mercie shine: Mine eye, my soule, my belly gnaw'n, with indignation pine. 10 My life with woe is worne to nought, my yeeres in sighing spent: My strength, my sinnes have over-wrought, my bones are gnaw'n and rent. 11 Reproach of all my foes I beare, my neighbours vehemently, And my familiars, strook with feare, my sight that meet mee flie. 12 My selfe a dead man out of mind, and in mens hearts forgot, As vile and use-lesse held I find, as is a broken pot. 13 For I have heard the multitude with slanders mee dismay; Against mee counsell, and conclude to take my soule away. 14 But, Lord, thou art my God, I said my trust relies on thee: 15 My times that in thy hand are laid, from hostile hand set free. 16 And on thy light-lesse servant make thy faces light to shine: O save mee for thy mercie sake, from this distresse of mine. 17 Lord, let not shame have share in mee, for on thee doe I call: Confounded let the wicked be, to Hell, strook-silent fall. 18 Of lying lips the lavish foords let forth no further breake, Which hard disdainfull spitefull words against the Just man speake. 19 How plentifull thy bounties be, which thou hast laid in store, For them that feare and trust in thee, the sonnes of men before! 20 Them in thy faces secret hide, from proud insulters wrongs; In thy Pavillion laid aside secure from strife of tongues. 21 Blest be the Lord, that wondrously his mercie hath dispenc't; And mee in safetie set to lye within a Citie fenc't. 22 Amaz'd, I said, before thine eies, cut off, and cast away; The voice yet heardst thou of my cries, when I to thee did pray. 23 O love the Lord, all ye his Saints, for faithfull doers waies The Lord preserves from all attaints, the haughty home repaies. 24 Be strong, endure, and doe your parts, the Lord will in the end Establish your encourag'd hearts, whose hopes on him depend. Psal. 32. Beati quorum. Davidis Maschil. 1 Blest is he, whose transgression hath free forgivenesse gain'd: And he, whose sinne that he hath done, a covering hath obtain'd. 2 Blest is the man, unto whose charge the Lord imputes no sin; Whose spirit no hollow holds so large, to lodge deceit therein. 3 When now my tongue all speech forborne, in painfull silence lay: Through my loud roaring daily worne, my bones with age decay. 4 For day and night with weight so great, thine hand upon mee lies, That like the drought in summers heat, my kindly moisture dries. Selah. 5 I did acknowledge unto thee the sinne that I had done: Of mine iniquitie in mee I have concealed none. 6 My sinne, I said, I will repeat, and to the Lord confesse: And of my crime thy mercy great, forgave the wickednesse. Selah. 7 Now therefore every Saint shall pray, while time to find is found: Sure, reach him none there is that may, when many waters sound. 8 From troubles heat my head to shade, thou art a secret place: With songs for my deliverance made, thou shalt about mee trace. Selah. 9 I will instruct, and teach thee so, thou shalt not walke awry: And in the way that thou shalt goe, give counsell with mine eye. 10 O doe not ye like Horse, like Mule, no understanding beare; Whose mouth must bit and bridle rule, to thee for comming neere. 11 Much sorrow swells on every side, to plague the wicked race: But in the Lord whose hopes abide, him mercy shall embrace. 12 Joy in the Lord, ye Just rejoyce, shout out your glad delight, As well in gesture, as in voice, all ye of heart upright. Psal. 33. Exultate Justi. 1 Ye Just, be joyfull in the Lord; becomes the righteous praise: 2 Harp, Violl, Voice, and Decachord, to praise the Lord up raise. 3 A new set-song to him endite, loud notes to musickes height: 4 For of the Lord the Word is right, and all his worke in faith. 5 His love on Justice he bestowes, desire with Judgement dwells: Of mercie from the Lord that flowes the earth with fulnesse swells. 6 The Heav'ns by word the Lord did frame, and as his mouth did breathe, His spirit made all the host of them above Sunne, and beneath. 7 The sea he bounds within the shore, on heaps the waters keeps: As into treasuries of store he giveth up the deeps. 8 To feare the Lord, all Regions call, on earth, through every land: And in the world the dwellers all, in awe of him to stand. 9 For as he spake, the word once past, the worke forthwith was done: As he commanded, it stood fast, his word and deed were one. 10 That Heathen counsell is destroi'd, the peoples plots cast out; And all their purposes made void, the Lord can bring about. 11 The counsell by the Lord decreed shall stand for ever sure: The thoughts that from his heart proceed, to age and age endure. 12 O blessed Nation, whom the Lord to be their God doth blesse: Blest people, whom his owne accord hath chosen to possesse. 13 The Lord, all Adams sons to see, in Heaven his station plants: 14 All from his Mansion vieweth hee, the earths Inhabitants. 15 Their heart he fashion'd all alone, the cloisters of their thought; Considers all what they have done, the workes that they have wrought. 16 Say, he command a copious Host, no King so saves his right: No Mighty man, whose might is most, delivered is by might. 17 A rest unsafe to save a man a Horse falls out to bee; Nor he by strength, strive all he can, can set his Rider free. 18 Behold, the Lord his heedfull eye on them that feare him bends: Upon his mercies safe supply, whose settled hope attends. 19 When earth exacts her due of earth, to free their soule from death; To keep alive in time of dearth, when famine faints for breath. 20 Our soule her hopes assured hold upon the Lord doth build: Of whose defence we may be bold, he is our help and shield. 21 Our heart in him shall gladnesse pure, and perfect joy conceive; That in his holy Name secure our hopes assurance leave. 22 Thy mercies gifts, O Lord, downe send, on us so free to fall; As we to thee our trust commend, to measure them withall. Psal. 34. Benedicam Domino. Davidis, cùm mutavit sensum suum ante Abimelech, &amp; relegavit eum, &amp; abiit. Acrostichon. 1 All times to blesse the Lord, will I occasions all prevent; And make my mouth continually his praises instrument. 2 Be thou, O Lord, my soules sole choice, my glories soveraigne head: The meeke shall heare it and rejoyce, by my example led. 3 Greatly extoll the Lord with mee. such praise together frame, As with his greatnesse may agree, to magnifie his Name. 4 Desirous that the Lord should heare, I sought him, and he heard, And sent mee out of all my feare deliverance un-deferr'd. 5 Him to behold, to him they flow'd, his light did them inflame: Upon their faces fell no cloud, no blush, the brand of shame. 6 Zealous, this poore man cri'd and crav'd so loud, for some redresse, That soon the Lord him heard and sav'd, from all his deep distresse. 7 Hovering about them, in pitch't field. JAH'S Angel spreads his wings: To them that feare him, for a shield to them releasement brings. 8 Taste but how good the Lord, and see: what blessings downe he sends: O blessed, blessed man is he, whose trust on him attends! 9 In feare, ye Saints, that serve the Lord, to serve him set your mind: All plenty doth his feare afford, no want his fearers find. 10 Courageous Lions hunger-pin'd, how poorly seeke they food! But they that seeke the Lord shall find no want, shall want no good. 11 Learne, sons, come listen unto mee, my doctrine with you beare: Your faithfull teacher will I be, how ye the Lord shall feare. 12 Man, who art thou, that wouldst live long, and see good dayes the while? No evill-teller, keep thy tongue, thy lips from speaking guile. 13 Shun evills out-side-falsers face, the in-side-foule eschew: Occasion to doe good embrace, seeke peace, her steps pursue. 14 His eares as to the Just to heed, so bends the Lord his eies: His eyes observers of their need, his eares to heare their cries. 15 Put against them that evill doe, firme sets the Lord his face, That out may their memoriall goe, cut off from earth their race. 16 True sorrowes guests, the poore they cry, the Lord their crying heares: His aide to them doth he apply, and all their troubles cleeres. 17 Care-broken hearts to them that have, the Lord is ever neere; And he the contrite spirit will save, his care with comfort cheere. 18 Redundant evills many fall, and on the Just encrease: Yet soon delivered from them all, the Lord will him release. 19 Summ'd up, he safeguards every bone, their number and their state, That broken of them goes not one to deaths returnlesse gate. 20 The passage home shall mischiefe thrust, the wicked man to slay: Just hand on them that hate the Just, a guilty death shall lay. 21 His servants soule the Lord redeemes, so deare to him esteem'd: And none, whose trust of him esteemes, as guilty shall be deem'd. Psal. 35. Judica, Domine. Davidis. 1 My right, O Lord, against them plead, that plead against my right: My powers to fight against them lead, whose powers against mee fight. 2 Upon thy dart-despising shield and buckler lay thy hand: In my defence to fight the field, and up to help mee stand. 3 Charge lance and sword, and stop the way where any mee pursu'th: Soule, I am thy salvation, say, say to my soule for truth. 4 Confusion let them never lacke, that seeke my soules surprize: Their branded faces shame send backe, my evill that devise. 5 Driven as the chaffe before the wind, let breath their burthen beare: The Angel of the Lord behind, them scatt'ring here and there. 6 Let darke and slipp'ry be their way, and let (that they may fall) The Angel of the Lord dismay, and persecute them all. 7 For closely they their net have rigg'd, corruptly to entoile; And causlesly a pit have digg'd, to make my soule their spoile. 8 Let desolation unawares, and head-long him forestall; And caught in his owne secret snares, selfe-mischiefe make him fall. 9 And let my soule her solace sing, that in the Lord I find: What joy doth his salvation bring, what musicke to my mind? 10 Which were my tongue enforc't to stay, and silent-strooke in mee: My bones would all breake forth, and say, Lord, who is like to thee, 11 That bringst deliverance to the poore, from hand for him too strong: The poore-afflicted from the doore, where rapine dwells and wrong? 11 False-witnesse did against mee rise, avouching termes untrue; And they to charge mee did devise, with what I never knew. 12 My good with evill they repaid, and for my recompence, My barren soule by them fore-laid, bereft of all defence. 13 But as for mee, when sicke they were, in sack-cloth weed I mourn'd: My humbled soule did food forbeare, my bosom'd-praier return'd. 14 I walk't, as if I had been one had lost a friend or brother; I bow'd downe sadly, as a sonne, that sorroweth for his mother. 15 But in my halting, glad together, the abject-scourges got: In spite or scorne, I knew not whether, to rend mee, resting not. 16 With flatterers, flouting Parasites at riotous Revells met, To feast their feasters with delight, their teeth against mee whet. 17 This, Lord, how long wilt thou behold? my soule from tumult free: My dearling from the Lions hold, let safely rescu'd be. 18 So in the great Assembly thankes to thee will I present: And through a mighty peoples rankes, will make thy praise be sent. 19 O make not my false-hearted foes triumphers over mee: With causlesse hate, their eyes which close, and sleering will not see. 20 For why? they speake not peace as friends, but beare us faire in hand, To crosse with their deceitfull ends the quiet of the land. 21 Their mouth on mee they opened wide, and full of scorne and ire: Aha, Aha, Our eye hath spi'd, (said they) our hearts desire. 22 Thou, Lord, hast seen all this excesse, then hold not thou thy tongue: From mee, O Lord, in this distresse depart not farre, nor long. 23 Arise, and make no longer pause, to judge my right awake: My God, my Lord, to plead my cause, of mine thine owne it make. 24 As Justice is thy touch, to trie, judge, Lord my God, of mee: And let not their unrighteous eie, my fall, their triumph see. 25 Let them not say within their heart, Ha, this our soule would have: Let them not say, We for our part have made our throat his grave. 26 Abash't confusion cloud their face, that at my hurt rejoyce: Shame be their shrowd, to my disgrace that magnifie their voice. 27 But joyfull shouting raise their spirit, and give their gladnesse way: That in my Justice take delight, this alway let them say, 28 “Thy servant prospers more, the more “his proud oppressors cease: “The Lord be magnifi'd therefore, “that loves his servants peace. 29 And so thy Justice shall fulfill the musicke of my tongue: Upon thy praise shall be my skill to descant all day long. Psal. 36. Dixit Insipiens. Ad Præstantem, servi Domini David. 1 Transgression of the wicked cries (within my heart I heare) Assuredly before his eies of God there is no feare. 2 For flatt'rie is the glozing dresse, wherewith his eyes he blinds, Untill his hatefull wickednesse an end as hatefull finds. 3 Of wicked words, and slie deceit, his mouth powr's out a flood: His heart for wisedome is no seat, his deeds dis-us'd to good. 4 In bed his mischiefe he begets, and throw's in thought-full brest: Himselfe in no good way he sets, nor evill doth detest. 5 Thy mercy, Lord, to Heaven extends, the Heav'ns are not so hie: Thy faithfulnesse the clouds transcends, transcends the highest skie. 6 Thy Justice, as Gods Mountaines steep, lift up a lofty crest: Thy Judgements are a mighty deep, thou, Lord, sav'st man and beast. 7 How good, O God, how precious things thy mercie doth enclose: When under shadow of thy wings mens sonnes their trust repose! 8 The fatnesse of thy house, their fill on them thou shalt bestow; And of the streames to drinke at will, from whence thy pleasures flow. 9 For why? of life from thee that streames, the fountaine is with thee: We in thy lights resplendent beames, enlightned light shall see. 10 To them that know thee, through this light thy tender love extend; To them that are in heart upright, thy Justice recommend. 11 Let not the lofty foot of pride invade mee from on hie: Let not the wicked arme provide a hand to make mee flie. 12 There are they fall'n, that wickednesse with travell exercise: Downe are they cast without redresse, or able meanes to rise. Psal. 37. Noli æmulari. Davidis, Acrostichon. 1 At evill doers evill deeds repine not, though they thrive: Envie them not, when well succeeds what wicked heads contrive. 2 For as the grasse to ripenesse grow'n, downe shall they soon be cut; And withered like the green herb mow'n, whereto the sithe is put. 3 Build on the Lord thy trust; doe good, and dwelling in this mind, Dwell in the land, where store of food thy faith shall surely find. 4 Upon the Lord set thy delight, thy vowes let him inspire; And he thy service shall requite above thy hearts desire. 5 Goe to the Lord to lead thy way, thy trust to him commit: And he thy steps shall (walking) stay, and make thy hopes to hit. 6 Thy Justice cleere as is the light, his furnace shall refine: The day at noon shines not so bright, as shall thy Justice shine. 7 Dumb-silent on the Lord attend, undaunted at his way, That prospers, when malignant end his slie devices lay. 8 Hold off from anger, wrath asswage, fret not thy selfe a whit; Lest like transgressors, in thy rage like evill thou commit. 9 For evill doers best successe themselves cut off shall end: The earth shall they and theirs possesse, that on the Lord attend. 10 Well, yet a little while expect, the wicked shall not be: Thine eye upon his place reflect, they are not His, nor He. 11 They shall possesse the earths encrease, that are of humble sp'rit: And in the multitude of peace, shall set their whole delight. 12 Zealously bent against the Just, the wicked grinds his teeth: 13 The Lord shall laugh to scorne his trust, whose day at hand he seeth. 14 Hand on the sword un-sheath'd, and bow fore-bent, the wicked lay: The poore afflicted downe to throw, the upright-wai'd to slay. 15 Their sword on them his point shall trie, and through their heart shall pierce: The bowes they bent shall broken lie, wherewith they were so fierce. 16 The little that the Just possesse availes to better steed, Than wicked riches, never lesse, than when they most exceed. 17 For broken shall be found the armes, whereto the wicked trust: But with his powerfull arme, from harmes, the Lord upholds the Just. 18 Instructed in the Perfect's waies, the Lord hath his fore-cast: An heritage before them laies, that shall for ever last. 19 In them shall shame inure no staine, when evill times grow rough: And in the daies that dearth doth raigne, then shall they have enough. 20 Consum'd yet wicked men in haste, JAH'S foes shall soon decay; As fat of lambes, as smoake doth waste, shall they consume away. 21 Large sums the wicked borrowing, shifts, and nothing payes againe: The Just is bountifull in gifts, of mercy makes his gaine. 22 In him shall they that blessed are possesse the earths increase: But they that in his curse have share, cut off (and soon) shall cease. 23 Mans steps, where-ever-so he treads, the Lord upholder staies: His way to him delightfull leads, and to his liking layes. 24 He through his frailty though he fall, away shall not be cast: For to uphold his hand withall, a hand, O Lord, thou hast. 25 Now I that have been young, am old, the Just man and his seed, Yet never did mine eye behold forsooke, nor seeking bread. 26 All day, he mercy shewes and lends, not less'ning so his heap: His seed that from his loines descends, the more in blessing reap. 27 Shun evills evill neighbourhood, no dwelling neere that doore: Depart from evill, and doe good, and dwell for evermore. 28 The Lord loves Judgement, and will not forsake his Saints at need: Preserv'd for ever is their lot, cut off the wicked seed. 29 The soile the Just inherit shall for their possession: The termlesse terme perpetuall, that they shall dwell thereon. 30 Plenty that in the Just abounds, from forth his floud-gates breakes: His mouth the deeps of wisedome sounds, his tongue of Judgement speakes. 31 Goe where he will, stay or depart, he hath a perfect guide: His great Gods Law is in his heart, his footing shall not slide. 32 To stall the Just man in his way, the wicked sets his watch: And takes occasion him to slay, advantage if he catch. 33 And though he fall into his hand, the Lord there leaves him not: Accus'd in judgement though he stand, the sentence is forgot. 34 Cleave to the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall hold up thee, To hold the land: whence cut away the wicked thou shalt see. 35 Ruffling the wicked have I seen, in highest pride of all: Wide-spreading, like a Laurell green, and like a Cedar, tall. 36 He past away, and loe was gone this Lord of so much ground; I sought him, but of such a one, no footstep could be found. 37 See and observe the Perfects close, the righteous man attend, What ever pressure him oppose, peace is his after-end. 38 Together, where transgressors all shall be destroi'd in haste: Of wicked men, their endlesse fall shall cut them off at last. 39 To all the righteous, from the Lord doth their salvation flow: Whose strength to them doth strength afford, when trouble strikes them low. By them the Lord their helper stands, deliverer of the Just; Deliverer-safe from wicked hands, because in him they trust. Psal. 38. Domine, ne in furore. Psalmus Davidis ad commemorandum. 1 My faults, let no reproofe of thine, Lord, in thy wrath repeat: Nor chastise any crime of mine in thy displeasures heat. 2 A show'r of arrowes shot from thee, come storming on my crowne: And some of them sticke fast in mee, thy hand doth presse mee downe. 3 My flesh is all un-sound within, in thy displeasure lest: My bones, by reason of my sin, are of their peace bereft. 4 My wickednesses heaped store, above my head is gone: The burthen of them is too sore, for mee to beare alone. 5 My festred stripes a loathsome sent, my foolishnesse bewray: 6 So crooked I, so bow'd, so bent, goe mourning all the day. 7 My flankes inflam'd with scorching smarts, that in my boiles abound: My flesh, that hath so many parts, not any part hath sound. 8 I feeble am, and broken sore, in mine unquiet fits: For griefe of heart I groan and roare, my paine so neere mee sits. 9 Before thee, Lord, my whole desire, my sighes not hid from thee: 10 My heart doth pant, my strength expire, mine eye-sight not with mee. 11 Alooffe my loving neighbours stood, before my stroake at hand: My friends, the neerest of my bloud, strove who should furthest stand. 12 And they that seeke my soule, set snares, that evill search and say: To circumvent mee unawares, went musing all the day. 13 I like a deafe man am become, that heares no sound at all: As from whose mouth (a man strook dumbe) not any word doth fall. 14 As one not hearing, held I fast mine eares, mine answers hold; As one un-meeke, reproofes to cast, whose mouth was not the mold. 15 Because, O Lord, I wait for thee, for thee my hopes awake: Thou, Lord my God, shalt answer mee, and answer for mee make. 16 Heare mee in this distresse (said I) lest they rejoyce at mee: And when my foot but steps awry, they magnifie to see. 17 And ready sure I am to halt, so hard thy hand doth straine: Continually with fresh assault, before mee is my paine. 18 My crimes I freely will confesse, and openly declare: Be sorry for my sinnes excesse, with un dissembled care. 19 Yet live my mighty foes the while, their power with mine compare: And they that doubled hate with guile, how multipli'd they are! 20 And they that evill pay for good, for gaine returne mee losse: Against mee that for goodnesse stood, ungraciously stand crosse. 21 Me doe not thou, O Lord, forsake, nor farre from mee be gone: 22 My God, more haste to help mee make, Lord, my salvation. Psal. 39. Dixi custodiam. Ad Præstantem, ad Jeduthun, Psalmus David. 1 What waies my wary foot shall presse, I will (said I) take heed: And with my tongue lest I transgresse, advisedly proceed. My mouth from speaking word amisse, as with a bridle curbe, Before mee while the wicked is, lest some distaste disturbe. 2 With stilnesse dumb I nothing spake, from termes I did refraine, Even good, untill my heart did ake, and troubled, was my paine. 3 My heart was hot in my desire, which silence smoth'red long: While thus I mus'd, out burst the fire, then spake I with my tongue. 4 Lord, make mee know my journies end, the measure of my daies: That I may learne what is to spend, how ceasing soon my waies. 5 Loe, thou hast given my daies a span, my world as nothing plaine: Before thee every settled man is (doubtlesse) wholly vaine. Selah. 6 Sure, shadow-like, man makes a shew, in vaine they vexe their mind: He heaps up goods, and doth not know what gatherer them shall find. 7 And now, Lord, what doe I expect? on whom doe I attend? On thee doe all my hopes reflect, in thee begin and end. 8 From all my foes deliver mee, that on my shame encroach; And make mee not for faults to thee, to be the fooles reproach. 9 As one strook dumbe, depriv'd of sense, complaint my mouth made none; Nor opened once that two-leav'd fence, for thou didst what was done. 10 Thy plague away from mee revoke, more than I can withstand: That am consumed by the stroke of thy resistlesse hand. 11 When man for sinne thy chastning wroth, with stripes calls home againe: Thou melt'st his beauty like a Moth; sure, earthly man is vaine. Selah. 12 Heare, Lord, my praier, and with thine eares, consider of my cries: Hold not thy peace, my speaking teares, hot-showring from mine eies. For I a stranger am with thee, nor seat have certaine here: A sojourner thou harbour'st mee, as all my fathers were. 13 O spare mee with a little breath, my strength to mee restore: Before I goe from hence to death, and then I be no more. Psal. 40. Expectans expectavi. Ad Præstantem, Davidis Psalmus. 1 As waiting for the Lord I stai'd, I waited patiently; And he to mee with present aide inclining, heard my cry. 2 He brought mee from the groaning pit, out of the my'rie clay: Upon a rocke my feet did fit, and ord'red all my way. 3 He gave into my mouth a song, that newly was compil'd: A Psalme to praise that did belong, and to our God was stil'd. This sight shall many eies behold, and feare what he hath done: Their hopes shall on the Lord lay hold, by my example wonne. 4 Blest is the man, whose hopes reflect upon the Lord his eies: That to the proud gives no respect, nor such as turne to lies. 5 O Lord my God, thy wonders wrought, thy thoughts, no thought of man: As thou to us, to thee hath brought, nor bring in order, can. 6 When I to speake of them addresse, and would their summe declare; Names greater than I can expresse, past number summes they are. 7 No sacrifice didst thou desire, yet opened hast mine eares: Nor offring-burnt for sinne require, which bloud-stain'd Altar beares. 8 My selfe I come, then (said I) loe, the booke-roll to attest: Thy will, my God, I joy to doe, thy Law is in my brest. 9 I to the great Assembly told, the Justice that thou shew'st: Nor shall my lips refraine, behold, and that, O Lord, thou know'st. 10 Thy Justice did I not obscure, hid in my heart to dwell: Thy faithfulnesse did I assure, and thy salvation tell. Thy loving kindnesse have I not, nor yet thy truth conceal'd: Nor in the great concourse forgot, to make them both reveal'd. 11 With-hold not, thou, O Lord, from me thy tender bowells store: Thy mercy, and thy truth let be my safeguards evermore. 12 For evills moe than may be told have round-environ'd mee: My sinnes on mee have caught such hold, I have no power to see. The haires upon my head that grow, in number they exceed: My heart with trouble stricken low, forsakes mee at my need. 13 Lord, let it be thy pleasure now, to safe deliver me: O Lord, to help me hasten thou, as able, ready be. 14 Shames loading let them never lacke, that would my soule destroy: Abash't confusion drive them backe, that at my evill joy. 15 Let desolation be their pay, the pension of their shame, Aha, Aha, to mee that say, and make my griefe their game. 16 Let those that seeke thee all, alway with joy in thee abide: Let thy salvations lovers say, “The Lord be magnifi'd. 17 On mee that poore and needy stand, yet thinkes the Lord my stay: My help with thy redeeming hand, my God, make no delay. Psal. 41. Beatus vir, qui intelligit. Ad Præstantem, Psalmus David. 1 Blest is the man, that wisely weigh the poore-afflicted can: Deliverance in the evill day, the Lord will send that man. 2 Him shall the Lord preserve alive, and keep on earth to blesse: Him to his foes thou shalt not give, their soule shall not possesse. 3 The Lord upholds his feeble head upon his couch of paine: Turnes in his sicknesse all his bed, returnes his health againe. 4 I said in depth of my distresse, Be gracious, Lord, to mee: O heale my soule, whose sinfulnesse hath sore offended thee. 5 On mee mine enemies exclaime, and evill of mee say: When shall he die? when shall his name with him be cast away? 6 And if to visit mee he come, his heart vaine falshood speakes: Iniquitie, his errands summe, at his returne forth breakes. 7 All they that hate mee, on a knot, against mee whisp'ring swarme: Against mee they this evill plot, devis'd to doe mee harme. 8 “An evill doome on him is past, “which he deserv'd before: And now (say they) that he lies fast, let him rise up no more. 9 Yea, in my peace the man so great, to speciall trust receiv'd: Which of my bread did also eate, his heele against mee heav'd. 10 Be gracious, Lord, to mee therefore, and raise mee up againe; And I to them shall then restore, like payment for their paine. 11 By this I know thou favour'st mee, that though my foes assaile: Triumphers yet they shall not be, against mee, nor prevaile. 12 But mee, in mine integritie thy hand doth still uphold: And set mee, where eternally thy face I may behold. 13 The Lord, the God of Israel, be blest for ever then: Let age to age eternall tell his praise: Amen, Amen. Finis Libri primi. Lib. II. Psal. 42. Quemadmodum desiderat. Ad Præstantem, erudiens, filiis Coreh. 1 Like as the braying Hind embost, desires the water brookes; So after thee, my soule neere lost, O God, sends longing lookes. 2 To God, the living God, for whom my soule so thirsteth sore: O when shall my appearance come, the face of God before? 3 My teares to mee have been the food, that day and night I eat: While daily they in scornfull mood, Where is thy God? repeat. 4 Remembrance of the time fore-spent, my soule upon mee poures; When to the House of God I went, at our accustom'd houres. We in the voice of joy and thankes, together held our way: A multitude of order'd rankes, that holy kept the day. 5 Why does my daunted soule give place, and droop in my distresse? Wait thou on God, healths of my face, whom yet I will confesse. 6 My soule (my God) within mee sinkes, and here in deserts still, On Jordan land, on Chermon thinks, on little Mitsghar hill. 7 Deep calls on deep, with thundring voice thy water-Canons sound: Thy billowes all with horrid noise, thy waves above mee bound. 8 His mercy will the Lord by day command, his song by night, With mee a praier to God to pray, my lives eternall light. 9 I unto God my Rocke will say, Why dost thou mee forget? Why walke I mourning on my way, opprest, and foe-beset? 10 A murth'ring through my bones doth gride, to my reproach all day: Where is thy God? in scornfull pride, when my distressors say. 11 Why does my daunted soule give place, and droop in my distresse? Trust God, my God, healths of my face, whom yet I will confesse. Psal. 43. Judica me, Deus. 1 Judge mee, O God, my pleading plead, against a perverse land: Assert mee from the wily head, and from the wrongers hand. 2 For of my strength the God thou art, why turn'st thou mee to goe, Opprest in habit as in heart, to mourne before the foe? 3 Send forth thy light and truth to fill my darke distrustfull brest, To guide mee to thy holy Hill, thy Tabernacles rest. 4 Then to Gods Altar will I goe, to God, my joyes excesse: And thee with Harp and Hymnes thereto, O God, my God, confesse. 5 Why does my daunted soule give place, and droop in my distresse? Trust God, my God, healths of my face, whom yet I will confesse. Psal. 44. Deus auribus. Ad Præstantem, filiis Coreh animadversio. 1 O God, we heard it with our eares, our fathers have us told, What deeds thou didst in former yeeres, what in their daies of old. 2 The Heathens how thy hand out-cast, our fathers seed to sowe: The people how thou didst lay waste, and made our parents grow. 3 For not by their owne swords keen edge, did they possesse the soile; Nor their owne arme can they alledge, did for their safety toile. But thy right hand, thine armes defence, thy countenances light; Thy favour gave them eminence, in them thou took'st delight. 4 My King, O God, on Jacobs head, thy saving healths command: 5 To hundge our foes, them downe to tread, thy Name for us shall stand. 6 For neither bow nor sword I have, whereon my trust to ground: 7 But thou art he from foes didst save, our haters didst confound. 8 Of God all day the praise we spread, and ever sing thy Name. Selah. 9 Of ours no host yet dost thou lead, but shunn'st, and leav'st us shame. 10 Thou mak'st us turne our backes in fight, and to our foes give way: That they that hate us hold but right, to make our goods their prey. 11 Thou sortest us on termes un-even, like sheep to serve for meat: Hast scatt'red us among the Heathen, as chaffe of winnow'd wheat. 12 Thy people hast thou sold for nought: Sold! rather hast forsooke: For they that sold, of them that bought, no prices for them tooke. 13 Thou hast expos'd us to reproach of neighbours round about; Too neere upon us that encroach, at us to scorne and flout. 14 Among the Heath'ns of our estate, a by-word didst thou make; The people that our heads did hate, their heads at us did shake. 15 And every day before mine eies is my confusion set: Beneath the vaile that on mee lies, my face and shame are met. 16 The loud reproachers voice I heare, the proud blasphemer brooke: To see thy face (my foe) I feare, and for th' Avenger looke. 17 All this upon us have we felt, yet have not thee forgot; Nor falsly with thy Covenant dealt, therein we fail'd thee not. 18 Our heart is backward turn'd to none, revolt is not our fault: Our steps out of thy pathes not gone, nor in thy pathes did halt. 19 In dens, where Dragons draw their breath, though thou hast crush't us neere; And covered with the shade of death, our heads thou heldst so deare; 20 If of our God at any time the Name we have forgot; Or of a stranger god, the crime, our hands up-lifted, blot. 21 Where-ever selfe this sinne bestowes, shall God not search it out? For he the very secrets knowes, in heart un-brought about. 22 For thy sake all day are we kill'd, whom else no crime could staine: On this account our bloud is spill'd, like sheep in shambles slaine. 23 Awake, why sleep'st thou all this space? for ever leave us not: 24 Rise, Lord, why hidest thou thy face, our wants, our woes forgot? 25 Our soule is humbled to the dust, our belly glew'd to ground: Rise, help, redeem us, of whose trust thy mercy is the bound. Psal. 45. Eructavit cor meum. Ad Præstantem, super Shoshannim, filiis Coreh. Canticum Amorum. 1 Mine heart is working out a piece of peerlesse skill: Mine argument the King, my tongue a speedy writers quill. 2 Than Adams sonnes more faire, grace from thy lips doth flow; His blessings therefore God on thee for ever did bestow. 3 Gird on thy thigh thy sword, great Champion as thou art: 4 With glory arm'd, and high renowne, faire prosper thy desert. 5 Ride on, the word of Truth and Meeknesse reigne thy Steeds; With Justice manag'd, thy right hand shall teach thee dreadfull deeds. 6 Whole Nations under thee, thine arrowes sharp shall bring: Shall of thy foes subdue the heads, and pierce the hearts, O King. 7 Thy Throne, O God, out-lasts the longest ages light: Thy Kingdomes Scepter, as the hand that holds the Scepter, right. 8 Just (as thy hate) thy love, with Justice loves to goe: Thy hate against injustice, just, holds wickednesse thy foe. Thee therefore God, thy God, so to himselfe endeers, As to annoint thee with the oile of joy above thy Peers. 9 In robes perfum'd with teares of Myrrhe and Aloë clad, With Cassia from the Ivory roofes, more than thy Makers glad. 10 Kings daughters in thy Traine, of thee their honour hold: Upon thy right hand sits the Queen, attir'd in Ophir gold. 11 O daughter, heare and see, hereto encline thine eare: Thy people, and thy fathers house forget that thine they were. 12 So covet shall the King thy beauty, his desire; He is thy Lord, him serve, observe, adore with heart entire. 13 Tyres daughter with a gift shall there beseech thy face: The wealthy Sydons peopled shores with presents sue for grace. 14 The daughter of the King all-glorious is within; Her robes of gold, her fairer face her fairest soules faire Inne. 15 So comes she to the King, in vesture needle-wrought. With Virgin-Ladies of her traine, to thee shall she be brought. 16 This Royall Troup along shall joy and gladnesse bring: And enter shall they in this pomp the Palace of the King. 17 Sonnes in thy fathers stead, of thee shall he beget: Sonnes whom thou maist in all the earth, for soveraigne Princes set. 18 Thy Name to age and age shall my remembrance sing: The people therefore on thy praise shall ever dwell, O King. Psal. 46. Deus noster, refugium. Ad Præstantem, filiis Choreh, super Gnalamoth. Canticum. 1 On God our stay and strength we ground, that refuge else have none: Aboundantly in trouble found, when other helps are gone. 2 Though earth should change, we would not feare, although the mountaines steep; Were rent, and hurri'd here and there, dis-bowell'd in the deep. 3 Should waves of waters roare and swell, or should the mountaines shake; When seas against the rockes rebell, and billowes batt'rie make: Selah. 4 There is a river streaming by, makes glad Gods Citie walls: The holy Torrent, O most-Hie, that from thy Mansion falls. 5 Amidst her God this care hath tooke, remov'd she shall not be: Which, forth before the morning looke, will God her keeper see. 6 The Heath'ns enrag'd these tumults felt, mov'd Kingdomes made a noise: He thundred, and the earth did melt, when God gave forth his voice. 7 The Lord of Hosts is on our side, our hosts to fortifie: The God of Jacob shall abide for us a refuge hie. Selah. 8 O come but hither, and behold what workes the Lord hath wrought: What desolations late, and old, his hand on earth hath brought. 9 Unto the earths extremest ends, he maketh warre expire: The bow he breakes, the speare he rends, the chariots burnes with fire. 10 That I am God, surcease, and know, among the Heath'ns will I Exalted be, by high and low, and in the earth made hie. 11 The Lord of Hosts is on our side, our hosts to fortifie: The God of Jacob shall abide for us a refuge hie. Psal. 47. Omnes Gentes plaudite. Ad Præstantem, filiis Choreh, Psalmus. 1 Ye people all, the Quire to fill, come clap your hands on hie: With joyfull voice to God shout shrill triumphant melodie. 2 For dreadfull is the Lord most-High, through earth a mighty King: 3 That Tribes and Nations farre and nigh, beneath our feet did bring. 4 An heritage for us he chose, (right) not to be remov'd: The excellency to dispose of Jacob his belov'd. 5 In triumph, with applauding noise, is God himselfe gone by: The Lord is with the Trumpets voice ascended up on hie. 6 Sing, make the praise of God your mirth, sing praises to our King: 7 For God is King of all the earth, a Psalme instructive sing. 8 Above the Heath'ns God raignes alone, co-equall none admits; Above the Heav'ns upon his Throne of Holinesse he sits. 9 The Nations Princes feed among the God of Abrahams flocke: For earths great shields to God belong, their high-exalted Rocke. Psal. 48. Magnus Dominus. Canticum Psalmi, filiorum Coreh. 1 Great is the Lord, prais'd all abroad, but chiefly to be prais'd; Where in the Citie of our God, his holy Mount is rais'd. 2 Mount Sion beauteous is in site, besides the Northern lands: Of all the earth the glad delight, the great Kings Citie stands. 3 God in her Palaces is knowne for her a refuge hie: 4 For Kings (behold) oppugnants grow'n, are gone together by. 5 This wondrous sight strook suddenly such terrour in their mind: No heart to stay, scarce feet to flie, could feare confounded find. 6 Upon them feare strong hold did build, and paine, the racke of feare; 7 As, when a woman bigge with childe, her burthen throwes to beare. 8 So (tempest-beaten) at their leake, the ships salt water drinke: The ships of Tarshish dost thou breake, and with an East wind, sinke. 9 As we have heard what deeds have been done in our fathers coasts; Like have we in the Citie seen, thy Citie, Lord of Hosts. The Citie which our God hath chose, and cleer'd from hostile hand, Will God establish and dispose eternally to stand. 10 In silence we (O God) attend, thy faithfulnesse to find: And when thy mercy thou wilt send, amidst thy Temple, mind. 11 Thy praise, O God, as farre extends, as doth thy Names command: Thy praise of earth fills all the ends, and Justice thy right hand. 12 Rejoyce, Mount Sion, most of all, be Judahs daughters glad: Because thy Judgements made them fall, that made her faces sad. 13 Goe compasse stately Sion Mount, her walls walke round about: The number of her Towers account, observe her strength throughout. 14 Set ye your heart upon her fort, view her high places well; And to your nephewes make report, that they to theirs may tell; 15 That this is God, our God, whose power for ever and beyond, Will be our guide and governour, and us till death defend. Psal. 49. Audite hæc. Ad Præstantem, filiis Coreh, Psalmus. 1 Heare, O ye people all, this lore, all in the world that dwell; Earth-borne and noble, rich and poore, together hearken well. 2 Of my discourse in every part, my mouth shall wisedomes teach, The meditation of my heart to understanding reach. 3 To heare a Parable propos'd, mine eare will I encline: Darke mysteries, and undisclos'd, upon my Harp divine. 4 I see no cause why I should dread, or day of evill doubt: When on my heeles the sins that tread, shall compasse me about. 5 Of them, whose hopes their heaps esteem, and of their riches boast: His brother no man may redeem, nor cleare to God that coast. 6 For precious is their soule of price, and dearer to release, Than whereunto may ransome rise, so that must ever cease. 7 That he may yet for ever live, and not to death submit: Nor to the earth his ashes give, nor see corruptions pit. 8 The wise, the foole, the brutish sot, he sees together die; And leave the wealth that they have got, on others wings to flie. 9 And yet they hold their houses sure, their shields unsoil'd with shames, Shall so from sire to sonne endure, and give their lands their names. 10 But man in honour bearing place, the night of death arrests: His brutish life by sinne made base, is silenc't like the beasts. 11 This is the foolish way they love, unconstant constant end: Which their posterity approve, and from their mouth commend. Selah. 12 They in the grave lie pent, like sheep, where death on them shall feed, Who, when the morning calls from sleep, obey the righteous seed. 13 Their image shall the grave bereave, and waste from where they dwell: But God shall ransome and receive my soule from hand of Hell. Selah. 14 Though one thou seest of riches seaz'd, yet be thou not affraid: With glory of his house encreas'd, though he thy wants upbraid. 15 For nothing with him when he dies conveigh from hence he must: His windy-glory from him flies, when he descends the dust. 16 For while on earth his daies did dwell, his soule he seem'd to blesse: And to thy selfe when thou dost well, of thee will men confesse. 17 His dwelling with his fathers all, shall be the house of Night: This brood of darknesse never shall behold eternall Light. 18 Man in this honour bearing place, of understanding void: Like brutish in his life, and base, is like the beasts destroi'd. Psal. 50. Deus Deorum. Psalmus Asaph. 1 The God of Gods, the Lord hath spoke, and earth to heare did call: From where the Eastern Sun-beames smoake, to where the Westerne fall. 2 From Sion (Beauties perfect prize) a Beauty more divine, That Sions beauties beautifies, did God in brightnesse shine. 3 Our God shall come, and silence cease, a fire before him eate: A vehement tempest shall encrease, and round about him beat. 4 Heaven from above, earth from below, his dreadfull voice will call: What Judgements weight, that they may know, shall on his people fall. 5 My Saints to mee assemble now, whose pledges I have tooke: My Covenant, that by solemne vow with sacrifice have strooke. 6 His righteousnesse heavens shall declare, where his decrees are writ, Where kept his Courts of Justice are, where God the Judge doth sit. 7 Heare, O my people, what I say, and I will testifie Against thee (Israel) this day, God, even thy God am I. 8 For not thy sacrifices want in thee will I reprove: Before mee thy burnt-offrings scant, mine anger never move. 9 I take no Bullocke from thy stall, nor Buck-goat from thy fold: 10 Mine are the Beasts that forrests all, or thousand mountaines hold. 11 I know all Fowles on every hill, the fields wild Beasts with mee: 12 If hungry, mine the worlds whole fill, I take and tell not thee. 13 Eate I Bulls flesh, or drinke the bloud of rancid Goates will I? 14 Sacrifice praise, thy vowes make good, to God, to God Most-Hie. 15 And in thy trouble call on me, that day upon me crie; And thy deliverer will I be, whom thou shalt glorifie. 16 But God to man ungodly saith, My Law why dost thou preach? My Covenant, failing in thy faith, affirming in thy speech. 17 Where thou to be reform'd dost hate, of all thy faults fore-past; And of my words the weight abate, and backe behind thee cast. 18 Saw'st thou a Thiefe, it was thy care, with him to hold consent; And with Adulterers, for thy share, thy feet fore-runners went. 19 Thy mouth thou turn'st to evill talke, thy evill thoughts to joyne: Thy tongue, the hammer, that doth walke, deceitfull slips to coine. 20 Thou sitt'st, and what was never done, against thy brother speak'st; And slandring so thy mothers sonne, thine in-bred malice wreak'st. 21 I held my peace, when thou hadst done, thy wicked thought suppos'd, Me like thy selfe, another one, as wickedly dispos'd. 22 But I shall thee reprove eftsoone, and set before thine eies, The evill deeds that thou hast done, the thoughts thou didst devise. 23 Forgetfull ye, and slow of sense, of God unmindfull minds, Consider, lest I rend you hence, where guilt no rescue finds. 24 He honours me, that praises paies, for sacrifices due; And I to him that rights his waies, will Gods salvation shew. Psal. 51. Miserere mei Deus. Ad Præstantem, Psalmus David, cùm venit ad eum Nathan Propheta, postquam ingressus est ad Bathsabagh. 1 Thy mercy great, O God, to me as graciously expresse: As thy compassions many be, blot out my trespasses. 2 Much deeper my defections lie, my soulnesse farther in: Wash throughly mine iniquitie, and cleanse me from my sin. 3 For of my crimes I know the cries, acknowledge every one: Continually before me lies the sinne that I have done. 4 To thee, thee only, sinn'd have I, done evill in thine eies: Thy Word of truth to justifie, how cleere thy judgement tries. 5 Behold, my shape when I receiv'd, did wickednesse begin: My mother when she me conceiv'd, conceiv'd in heat of sin. 6 Loe, truth within mine inmost part doth thy delight affect: And thou the secret of my heart, by wisedome shalt direct. 7 With hyssop purifie this deed, so purg'd I cleane shall grow: Wash mee, my whitenesse shall exceed the whitenesse of the snow. 8 Of joy and gladnesse, make me heare thy reconciling voice: The bones by thee that broken were, shall then afresh rejoyce. 9 Hide from my sins thy face, forget what follies I have done: All my misdeeds blot out, and let thy wrath remember none. 10 Cleane heart to me, O God, create, this spirit of mine subdue; Right spirit in me regenerate, and re-inspire anew. 11 And cast me not, but of thy face, where sight I may possesse: Nor from my sinfull flesh displace thy Spirit of Holinesse. 12 The joy that thy salvation gives, restore to me againe; And with thy Spirit, where freedome lives, my sin-bound soule sustaine. 13 Then shall I teach transgressors all, within thy waies to tread; And sinners my example shall to thee converted lead. 14 Deliver me, O God, from bloud, pale deaths polluted spring: God of my health, my tongue aloud shall of thy Justice sing. 15 My sin-shut lips, Lord, open thou with thy kind mercies keyes: So then my mouth will I bestow, in setting forth thy praise. 16 For sacrifice none thou requir'st, else would I give it thee: Burnt-offrings neither thou desir'st, nor thy delights they be. 17 A wounded spirits heart-breaking smart, to God burnes sacrifice: A broken and a contrite heart, thou, God, wilt not despise. 18 On Sion, as thy goodnesse falls, with wonted favour fill'd: Of thy Jerusalem the walls, on thy good pleasure build. 19 Then sacrifice of righteousnesse to please thee shall ascend: Burnt-offrings whole thine Altar presse, and frequent Calves contend. Psal. 52. Quid gloriaris? Ad Præstantem, Maschil Davidis. Cùm veniret Doeg Idumæus, &amp; nunciaret Sauli, ac diceret illi, Venit David in domum Achimelec. 1 Why dost thou, Tyrant, mischiefe boast, how much thou canst procure? Gods mercy (doe thy worst and most) doth daily yet endure. 2 Thy tongue of evill doth entreat, which forth thy falshood puts: As thou with doing of deceit, so sharp no razor cuts. 3 At evill more than good to reach, thy earnest love is bent; And then on Justice is thy speech, on falshood rather spent. 4 To speake all words that may devoure, thy lewd desire doth long, To swallow up, where thou hast power, O thou deceitfull tongue. 5 For ever thee shall God destroy, and from thy dwelling place, From where the living land enjoy, rend and root out thy race. 6 And this the Just shall also see, and seeing this shall feare; And laugh to scorne the Brave, whom he thus brought to nought shall heare. 7 Behold the strong, that of his state, not God the strength did seat: Whose trust was in his riches rate, in evill only great. 8 I, alwaies like an Olive green, my growth of daies to spend: Shall in the House of God be seen, whose mercy I attend. 9 Thy deeds my praises shall proclaime in publike evermore: And patiently expect thy Name so good, thy Saints before. Psal. 53. Dixit Insipiens. Ad Præstantem, super Mahalath. Psalmus Davidis. 1 There is no God, in heart to say, so farre the foole is gone: Corrupt and odious is their way, good-doer there is none. 2 Downe from the Heavens God look't to see, what Adams sons desir'd: Of understanding who was he, that after God enquir'd. 3 Out of the way they are all gone, gone altogether backe: Good deed, good-doer none, not one, of all their loathsome packe. 4 Is all their understanding fled, to wicked workes that fall? That eate my people up like bread, on God they never call. 5 There did they feare, where was no feare, to fright those guilty ones: For God hath scattered here and there the proud besiegers bones. 6 Them to confusion hast thou sent, thine enemies surpriz'd With shame (of sin the best event) for God hath them despis'd. 7 Salvations who to Israel shall out of Sion give? When they that now in bondage dwell, no longer captives live. His people home when God hath had, of whom he made his choice: Then Jacobs Nation shall be glad, and Israel rejoyce. Psal. 54. Deus, in nomine. Ad Præstantem, in Neghinoth, Maschil Davidis, cùm venissent Ziphæi, &amp; dixissent Sauli, Nonne David abscondit se nobiscum? 1 Thy Name in this distresse of mine, O God, to save mee send: To judge me, as revenge is thine, thy powerfull strength extend. 2 Unto my praier, O God, draw neere, that I to thee commend; And of my mouth the words to heare, thine eare attentive bend. 3 For strangers up against me rise, and tyrants take the way, Not taking God before their eies, to marke my soule their prey. Selah. 4 But God my helper is, behold, in my defence to stand: To help them that my soule uphold, the Lord is neere at hand. 5 By evill that my foes contrive, of their desir'd successe, His like reward shall them deprive, them in thy truth suppresse. 6 An offring of a free-will'd heart to thee will I present; And praise thy Name, O Lord, that art to goodnesse wholly bent. 7 For by the helps he did apply, my troubles all expire: And on mine enemies, mine eye hath seen my full desire. Psal. 55. Exaudi Deus. Ad Præstantem, in Neghinoth, Maschil Davidis. 1 Unto my praier, O God, give eare, that where thou art in place, My supplication may come there, and thou not hide thy face. 2 Intend, and answer my complaint, with straining up my voice: In these extremes of woe that faint, and make a troubled noise. 3 The enemies reproaches ring, the wicked raise debate: Iniquitie on me they bring, and wroth the hand of hate. 4 My heart within me troubled sore, is rack't to sorrowes height: Than death it selfe, deaths terrours more oppresse me with their weight. 5 Upon me feare and trembling fell, and over me at last, (My sorrowes best befitting cell) a covering, horrour cast. 6 O, had I of a Dove (said I) the wing, to waft my brest, I then from these assaults would flie, and find some seat of rest. 7 Hence would I get me farre (behold) and in the Deserts bide, Where I could seaze some safer hold, my harmlesse head to hide. 8 Hence would I hasten mine escape, and (horrour left behind) Exchange my shelter and my shape, to shun the stormy wind. 9 Their discord-tongues, O Lord, divide, by swallowing up their life: For in the Citie have I spi'd, that rapine reignes and strife. 10 Upon the walls thereof they goe, in compasse day and night, And in the midst thereof by woe, stands mischiefe arm'd with might. 11 Within her, who there walkes awhile, but wickednesse he meets: Dissembling mates, deceit and guile, depart not from her streets. 12 For, not my soe was my disgrace, his blow I could have borne: From open hate have hid my face, had he heav'd up his horne. 13 But it was thou, that went'st aside, didst (faithlesse) faith pretend: O man, my other halfe, my guide, mine owne familiar friend. 14 Our Counsell sweetly did consent, conceiv'd on either part: As brethren to Gods House we went, as in two breasts one heart. 15 Let hasty death upon them throng, and send them quicke to Hell: For evills are their roofes among, within them where they dwell. 16 But I will call on God, and soon the Lord will safety send: At even will pray, at morne, at noone, while he my cry intend. 17 He hath redeem'd my soule in peace, from battels doubtfull feare: Against me, as they did increase, so with me many were. 18 Yea, God shall heare, and hold them low, he that of old abode: Selah. For changelesse, but to worse they grow, and why? they feare not God. 19 Against the heads, with him at peace he hath sent forth his hand; And (faithlesse) having no release, profan'd his Covenants band. 20 His mouth more smooth than butter, words, but in his heart made warre; More soft than oile, than speares, darts, swords, words wounding deeper farre. 21 Upon the Lord thy burthen cast, and he shall nourish thee; And give the Just to stand so fast, that mov'd they never be. 22 The wicked, thou, O God, shalt fling into corruptions pit: Where they untimely perishing, beyond all time shall sit. Men stain'd with blouds, and fraudulent, ripe age shall never see: Nor live out halfe their daies well-spent; but I will trust in thee. Psal. 56. Miserere mei Deus. Ad Præstantem, super Columbam mutam Remotorum, Michtam Davidis, cùm deprebenderent eum Pelishtim in Gath. 1 Be mercifull, O God, to mee, whom man would make his prey: Whose hands from fighting never free, oppresse me all the day. 2 My foes to swallow me out-right, their daily powers apply: For many hands against me fight, O thou that art Most-Hie. 3 The day that cloudy doubts appeare, to make my heart affraid; My hopes yet shining through my feare, expect thy promis'd aide. 4 In God by me his Word sincere, sincerely prais'd shall be: In God I trust, and will not feare what flesh can doe to me. 5 To wrest my words is all their care, their daily counsells end, Against me, all for evill are the thoughts that they entend. 6 Together all lay out their line, as close as hooke in bait: Observing every step of mine, when for my soule they wait. 7 Shall wickednesse such wages have? so safe shall they escape? Digge in thy wrath, O God, the grave that for their fall shall gape. 8 Thou numbrest all my wandring yeeres, what toiles I undertooke: Told in thy bottle put my teares, are they not in thy booke? 9 That day that I upon thee call, my foes shall turne their backe: Of God, I know, I never shall the gracious favour lacke. 10 In God the Word will I commend, the Word praise-worthy most: Lord, of thy Word, where is no end of praise, my praise shall boast. 11 On God my hopes their anchor throw, affraid I will not be, What earthly man to me can doe, or challenge done by me. 12 Thy vowes, O God, upon me are, which I to thee will pay: And sacrifice of praise prepare before thy face to lay. 13 For thou my soule from death didst free, my feet from sliding quite: To walke, O God, in sight of thee, with them that live in light. Psal. 57. Miserere mei Deus. Ad Præstantem. Ne corrumpas, Michtam Davidis, cùm fugeret â facie Saulis in speluncam. 1 Be mercifull to me, O God, be mercifull to mee: For as my safeties sole abode my soule doth trust in thee. And in the shadow of thy wings, my hopes assurance seat: Till time an end of evills brings, and calme this tempests heat. 2 I unto God Most-High will call, my plaint before him lay: Whose promise firme performance shall in full perfection pay. 3 He from the Heavens shall send his hand, and save me by his power: Hath mark't him with reproaches brand, whose mouth would me devoure. Selah. 4 His mercy, and his truth, before shall God send forth in aide: For, where fierce Lions ramp and roare, my soule is subject laid. 5 Among the sons of man I lie, that fire and fury breathe: Speares from whose teeth, and arrowes flie, whose tongues sharp swords unsheath. 6 O God, where brightnesse most abounds, above the Heavens ascend: Thy glories beames beyond the bounds of all the earth extend. 7 A net they for my steps have laid, and downe my soule is bow'd: But in the trench are they betrai'd, which they for me had plow'd. 8 My heart, O God, is fixt on thee, on thee my heart is fixt: The song that I shall sing, shall be of thankes and praises mixt. 9 Awake, my glory, slow delay my Lute and Harp off shake: Before the Starre that ushers day, I early will awake. 10 To thee, O Lord, my thankes will I among the people bring; And where the Nations scatt'red lie, aloud thy praises sing. 11 The greatnesse of thy mercies store above the Heavens doth streach: Thy truth up to the skies doth soare, a higher pitch to reach. 12 O God, where brightnesse most abounds, above the Heavens ascend: Thy glories beames, beyond the bounds of all the earth extend. Psal. 58. Si verè utique. Ad Præstantem. Ne corrumpas. Davidis. 1 And call ye this (O men of Might) pronouncing sentence just? And call ye this to judge upright, O eldest sons of dust? 2 Yea, wickednesse ye worke in heart, and under faire pretence: Where through the earth ye hold your Mart, your hands weigh violence. 3 The wicked, from their mothers wombe estrang'd, from goodnesse flie; And erring, from the belly come, no sooner speake, but lie. 4 The poysoning Serpent poyson beares, lesse deadly than their sting: With like deafe eare the Python heares the wise Enchanter sing. 5 Their teeth, O God, breake in their mouth, the Lions tuskes out-root: 6 Like waters, Lord, shrinke up their growth, cut off the shafts they shoot. 7 As Snaile consum'd within the shell, all out in slime is runne: Abortive as the birth that fell, so see they not the Sunne. 8 Before your pots perceive the thorne, or feele the brambles heat, Let whirling-fury tempest-borne, their counsells crude defeat. 9 So shall the Just rejoyce a good, to see the vengeance raigne; And wash his feet in reeking bloud of wicked doers slaine. 10 So say shall men of mortall kind, fruit for the just there is: There is a God, the earth shall find, and judgement (doubtlesse) his. Psal. 59. Eripe me. Ad Præstantem. Ne corrumpas, Davidis Michtam, cùm mittente Saule, observaretur domus, ut interficerent eum. 1 From them that are mine enemies, my God, deliver mee: From them that up against me rise, my head up-rais'd set free. 2 Assert thou mee from their pursuit, that evill worke with paine; And from their hands, whom blouds pollute, in safety me sustaine. 3 Loe, for my soule in wait they lie, the strong together draw: When fault of mine they none could spie, nor sinne, O Lord, they saw. 4 Without iniquitie in mee, they runne and ready make To meet me, raise thy selfe and see; my helper, Lord, awake. 5 Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, To visit all the Heathen coasts, against thee that rebell. 6 And where for grace to thee alone, fraile sinners find accesse: O let thy mercy favour none, that faithlesly transgresse. Selah. 7 They, when the evening Sun shuts in, run jetting to and fro; And like a dogge they howle and grin, and round the Citie goe. 8 Vollies loe from their mouth they shoot, swords in their lips they beare: Weapons that warre with silent foot, for who (say they) shall heare? 9 But thou, O Lord, shalt them deride, make all the Heath'ns a mocke: That strength to thee will I ascribe, to thee, O God, my Rocke. 10 God of my mercy shall prevent, and in such plight to mee; Mine enemies shall God present, as my desire would see. 11 Whom let not slaughters hand devoure, lest that my flocke forget: Disperse them by thy mighty power, them, Lord our shield, defeat. 12 Their sinfull mouth, their lip-wise words, let their swolne pride descry: And take them in their selfe-twin'd cords, that curse, forsweare, and lye. 13 Consume, consume them in thy wrath, that they no more may grow: What empire God in Jacob hath, through earth that they may know. 14 As soon as day his light drawes in, returne they to and fro; And like the dogge, they howle and grin, and round the Citie goe. 15 Goe wandring here and there for meat, and snart, if un-suffic'd: They find short fare for them to eate, by want and hunger siz'd. 16 But I will sing thy mighty power, thy mercy early praise: For thou hast been my fortresse-Tower, my Rocke in restlesse daies. 17 I, O my strength, to thee will sing, to God, my refuge hie: The God that makes his mercies spring, my mercies treasurie. Psal. 60. Deus repulisti. Ad Præstantem, super Sushan-Eduth, Michtam Davidis, ad docendum, cùm contenderet erga Aram Naharaim, &amp; erga Aram-zobah, &amp; conversus Joab, et percussit Edom in valle Salis duodecim millia. 1 Thou hast, O God, cast us aside, routed our poore remaine: Thine angry brow hast bent to chide, O turne to us againe. 2 The trembling earth thou didst invade, and rifts therein hast cleft: O heale the breaches thou hast made, for it is shaking left. 3 Thou shewdst thy people harder things, than they had borne before: Of wine, that stupid horrour brings, to drinke, thou gav'st them store. 4 To them that feare thee hast thou given a signe, to shun the bow: A Banner, by the hand of Heaven set up, for truth to shew. 5 That free deliverance they may have, that are belov'd of thee: With thy resistlesse right hand save, O heare and answer mee. 6 God in his Holinesse hath spoke, which I with joy repeat: In Shechem will I strike the stroke, and Succoths valley mete. 7 Mine Galghad is, Manasseh mine, strength of my head doth live: In quiver-bearing Ephraims line, my Law shall Judah give. 8 My wash-pot Moab will I make, my shooe on Edom fling: Thy pride, Pelesheth overtake, and to my triumphs bring. 9 The Citie of such strength within, what guide shall make me get? The warlike Edoms towers to win, what Leader shall I set? 10 When thou, O God, as nought of worth, hast cast us off so long; And with our Armies wentst not forth, to make our battels strong. 11 O give us help from our distresse, mans health is vaine deceit: Through God we shall doe valiantnesse, our foes he shall defeat. Psal. 61. Exaudi Deus. Ad Præstantem, super Neghinoth. Davidis. 1 My crie, O God, my praier attend, when I to thee complaine: 2 When from this earths extremest end my smoth'red heart I straine. 3 Conduct me to the Rocke of power, that higher is than I: 4 For thou hast been my hopes strong tower against the enemie. 5 Thy Tabernacle will I take, for ever there to dwell; And to my hopes a shelter make, thy wings my secret cell. Selah. 6 For thou to heare my vowes from heaven, thine eare, O God, didst frame: An heritage to me hast given, of them that feare thy Name. 7 Daies upon daies encreast by thee, thou to the King shalt give: The compasse of his yeeres shall be, from age to age to live. 8 Him God before his face to sit, for ever shall accept: With mercy, truth prepare thou fit, by whom he may be kept. 9 Praise to thy Name so will I sing, for ever day by day: To thee my vowes upon me bring, that I may duly pay. Psal. 62. Nonne Deo? Ad Præstantem, apud Jeduthun. Psalmus Davidis. 1 On God my silent soule attends, his seasons (surely) heeds: To him my safeties care commends, from whom my health proceeds. 2 He surely is my Rocke of power, and my salvation prov'd: My hold, my high-defensive tower, I shall not much be mov'd. 3 How long on mischiefe will ye thinke? Man-slayers, slaughtred all, Ye like a ruin'd fense shall sinke, and like a shaken wall. 4 His dignity how to suppresse, their counsells they convert: Delight in lies, with mouth they blesse, but curse within their heart. Selah. 5 On God, yet never thou the lesse, my silent soule, attend: From whom my hopefull patientnesse expects a happy end. 6 He surely is my Rocke of power, and my salvation prov'd: My hold, my high-defensive tower, I shall not be remov'd. 7 In God is my Salvations port, my Glories lofty crest, Rocke of my strength, in God my Fort, my Confidences rest. 8 O people, trust in him alway, your heart before him powre: For of our hopes God is the stay, our safeties trusty towre. 9 Sure, Adams sonnes are vanitie, and lighter in account: The best together weigh'd, a lie, and make the ballance mount. 10 Trust not in wrong, to reap your part, in rapine be not vaine: If wealth encrease, set not your heart on baited lures of gaine. 11 God spake at once, which twice I heard, “To God the power pertaines; Of punishment, and of reward, of pardons, and of paines. 12 And mercy, Lord, in thee alone exceeds, from thee proceeds: For thou wilt render every one according to his deeds. Psal. 63. Deus, Deus meus. Psalmus David, cùm is esset in solitudine Jehudah. 1 Thou art, O God, my God alone, mine eies shall watch to see The Nights obscurer watchmen gone, and early seeke for thee. 2 For thee my thirsty soule doth toile, for thee my flesh doth long: Within a waste and weary soile, and waters none among. 3 Within thy Sanctuaries seat, which now I see no more; To see thy power and glory great, as I have seen before. 4 For, good thy mercy is above the gladsome length of daies, More lovely is than life thy love, “My lips shall sing thy praise. 5 Thus will I blesse thee, while I live, while breath this breast commands; And in thy Name, the off'ring give of my up-lifted hands. 6 With marrow, and with fatnesse fed, my soule shall be full fill'd; And from my mouth thy praises spread, through joyfull lips distill'd. 7 Of thee my bed remembrance brings, by night I watch for thee: 8 And shout, when shadowed with thy wings, thy saving help I see. 9 To thee my Hermit-soule adheres, here, from thy House expell'd; Where never thy right hand forbeares, nor leaves me un-upheld. 10 But they, that make my life their prey, and for my soule contend: Where lowest earth hath made their way, to death let them descend. 11 A hand on them the sword shall heave, and shed their guilty blood: The loath'd remainder they shall leave, shall be the Foxes food. 12 In God, be glad, yet shall the King, and all that sweare Him by, Shall glory, but be stopt the spring, the lips that speake a lie. Psal. 64. Exaudi Deus. Ad Præstantem. Psalmus David. 1 Unto my voice, O God, give eare, to whom my praier doth goe: Preserve my life from pallid feare, of my pursuing foe. 2 My head from secret counsells hide, that wicked heads contrive; From rage against me open wide, that evill doers drive. 3 With venom'd edge and fell intent which whet their tongues like swords; And shoot in bowes by malice bent, (sharp arrowes) bitter words. 4 A secret shot at him to fit, that is in heart upright: With sure and sudden hand they hit, and feare not where it light. 5 Themselves in mischiefe make they bold, and commune how to lay Their secret snares, to take sure hold, and, who shall see them? say. 6 Iniquities new shapes have sought, and masked faces found; Discovering of their wicked thought, the heart-corrupted ground. 7 But God, a sudden shaft sharp ground, and swifter than the wind, Shall shoot at them, and in the wound, shall leave the head behind. 8 Yea, their owne tongues shall they incite, upon themselves to fall: Which all that see, with fearfull flight, shunne their example shall. 9 All earthly men shall in their feare, the worke of God declare; And wisely weigh what these men were, and whose these doings are. 10 The just and upright, for his part, shall in the Lord rejoyce; And trust in him: All true of heart, shall glory in their choice. Psal. 65. Te decet Hymnus. Ad Præstantem. Psalmus David Canticum. 1 On thee waits Sions silent praise, O God, that hear'st the praier: 2 To thee, the vow thy people paies, to thee all flesh repaire. 3 Iniquities, with words at will, against me have prevail'd; But our transgressions covering still, thy mercy never fail'd. 4 O blessed he, whom thou dost chuse, so neere thy Courts to dwell: Thy Houses goods where we may use, thy Temples plenty, tell. 5 Thou God, our health, by fearfull signes shalt answer us againe: Just hope of all that earth confines, or farthest seas containe. 6 Which by his strength lifts up the hills, above the plaines to towre; And firmnesse to their height fulfills, which girded is with pow'r. 7 Which stills the raging of the seas, be-calmes the billowes sounds; And (more outragious, to appease) the peoples tumult bounds. 8 On earth, the utmost dwellers feare thy signes: The goings out Of East and West (thy light that beare) for joy thou mak'st to shout. 9 Thou visitest the soile with showres, of life-inspiring raine; Rich Mynes of pearle, thy deaw downe powres, the greedy Plowmans gaine. 10 Gods River reacheth far and wide, thy care prepares the corne; And seed, to mother earth dost hide, in teeming-furrow borne. 11 The waters melt her drunken plaine, the verdant blossomes swell; On whose encrease, as drops of raine, so many blessings dwell. 12 The yeere, with goodnesse dost thou crowne, beginning where thou end'st; And every step stills fatnesse downe, which from the clouds thou send'st. 13 They drop upon the pastures wide, that robe the wildernesse; The little hills, begirt with pride, no little joy expresse. 14 The pastures cloth'd with flockes un-shorne, their double fleeces bring: The vallies covered are with corne, for joy they shout and sing. Psal. 66. Jubilate Deo. Ad Præstantem, Canticum Psalmi. 1 In God be joyfull all the earth, his Names renowne to raise: 2 Sing Psalmes, make loud triumphant mirth, put glory to his praise. 3 Say unto God, Thy dreadfull deeds, who can enough expresse? Whose foes, thy power, that so exceeds, (faign'd tongues, false hearts) confesse. 4 The earth throughout, to worship thee, their humbled hearts shall frame; And of thy praise, in Psalmes agree, to sing unto thy Name. Selah. 5 The workes of God, O come and see, what he to passe hath brought, What terrible atchievements he for Adams sons hath wrought. 6 The Sea, away on heaps he sent, the Deep he made dry ground: Where, through the floud on foot we went, in him, there joy we found. 7 He rules for ever by his power, on Nations sets his eies: That (never rais'd, but, to devoure) rebellion, never rise. Selah. 8 And ye, our God, O people blesse, with tongues, and hearts prepar'd, Through every land, let more or lesse, his praises voice be heard. 9 Which putting deaths blacke darts aside, our soule in life doth stay: And suffering not our foot to slide, upholds us in our way. 10 For thou, O God, didst triall make, what heat we could endure: If fire could force us thee forsake, that fines the silver pure. 11 Thou broughtst us where we were betrai'd, and tangled in the net: Where straitnesse on our loines was laid, and pinching pannels set. 12 Thou causedst men, as heads of nought, above our heads to ride: Through fire and waters hast us brought, where peace and plenty bide. 13 With offrings burnt my vowes to pay, I to thine house will presse, Performing what my lips did say, the mouth of my distresse. 14 Burnt sacrifices, fatlings throats, to thee will I returne: Rams incense, Bullockes, and Buck-goats, upon thine Altar burne. Selah. 15 O come, and hearken every one, of God that stand in feare; And for my soule what he hath done, ye from my mouth shall heare. 16 I with my mouth to him complain'd, his praise my tongue preferr'd: If wicked sight my heart had stain'd, the Lord would not have heard. 17 God surely heard my voice complaine, my praier to him repaire: Blest God, that turn'd not backe againe his mercy from my prai'r. Psal. 67. Deus misereatur. Ad Præstantem, in Neghinoth. Psalmus Cantici. 1 In mercy God to us encline, and blesse us with his grace: Upon our darknesse make to shine, his light out-shining face. Selah. 2 That knowne may be thy heavenly way, within this earthly round: That thy salvations message may among all Nations sound. 3 Thy praise, O God, let peoples sing, as far as nights and daies, The Sun transcends his signes to bring; all people sing thy praise. 4 For joy let all the Nations shout, for thou with righteous doome, Shalt judge the people earth throughout, the Nations guide become. Selah. 5 Thy praise, O God, let peoples sing, as far as nights and daies, The Sun transcends his signes to bring; all peoples sing thy praise. 6 In field and furrow then the land shall yeeld her fruits increase; And God, our God, with gracious hand, to blesse us shall not cease. 7 His blessing God on us shall send, all Nations far and neere: The earth throughout, from end to end, of him shall stand in feare. Psal. 68. Exurgat Deus. Ad Præstantem, Davidis, Psalmus Cantici. 1 Let God arise, and (disarai'd) his scattred foes give place: And let his haters all dismai'd, flie from before his face. 2 Driven, as the smoake before the wind, as waxe, at fire, doth melt; So perish let the wicked kind, Gods awefull presence felt. 3 But let the Just in him rejoyce, before Gods face expresse Their joy of heart, with gladsome voice shout out their joyes excesse. 4 Sing, sing to God, his Name on hye, that rides through Deserts, raise: Make JAH'S Name way, and joyfully before his face sing praise. 5 The Father of the fatherlesse, Judge of the widowes crie Is God, whose Throne of Holinesse, whose Mansion is on hie. 6 God into housholds doth dispose the solitarie Cell: The prisoners lock't in chaines sets loose, in drought lets Rebells dwell. 7 O God, when through the Desert-sands, thou went'st before thy flockes; And taught'st their clay-worne feet and hands, to climbe Arabian rockes. Selah. 8 Earth shooke, Heav'ns swet, Mount Sinai fell, and shrunke, to give God place: When God, the God of Israel, shew'd forth his face: His face! 9 Thou shedd'st, O God, a gracious Raine, and thine Inheritance, Long languishing in thirsty paine, thy deawes did re-advance. 10 Therein the Congregation dwelt, this coast thy creatures shar'd: Thus hath (O God) thy goodnesse dealt, thus for the poore prepar'd. 11 The Lord gave word, by women spread, through that great Army they Sung, “Kings, with Armies fled; they fled, The House-Dove shar'd the prey. 12 Your beauty, though the pots have spilt, where (sooty) ye have line: With silver wings, neckes parcell-gilt, your Dove-like plumes shall shine. 13 When God Almighty gave the blow, where Kings confounded fell: Our Sion, shady-Tsalmons snow, for whitenesse did excell. 14 Gods Mountaine, as Mount Basan stands, Mount Basan, fertile, hie: Whose crest, so many crests commands, to Sion comes not nie. 15 Insulting Hills, so high, so great, this Mountaine God loves well: The Lord desires to make his seat, for ever here to dwell. 16 Myriads of Angels; Mighty Names, Gods Chariots, Millions fill; In them the Lord, as Sinai's flames, on Sions holy Hill. 17 Thou art ascended up on hie, above the fiery heaven; Hast captive led captivitie, and gifts in man hast given. With them (the more ingratefull they, that faithlesse did rebell; And but compell'd, would not obey) that thou Lord God mightst dwell. 18 The Lord be blest, throughout our land, whose boundlesse mynes of wealth, With bounty daily load our hand, the God, our saving health. Selah. 19 God our salvations is become, our God, that gives us breath, Eternall is, the Lord, to whom the issues are of death. 20 Sure, God will smite his haters heads, and wound the hairie skull Of him, that life ungodly leads, and sinne on sinne doth pull. 21 The Lord said, I will bring againe, from Basans slaughtred King; Thee, from the gulfes amid the Maine, againe, my people, bring. 22 Deep in the bloud of Tyrants shed, thy trampling foot to staine; And of thy dogs the tongue die red, where all thy foes lie slaine. 23 What triumphs thee, O God, did bring, they saw it face to face; Thy goings, O my God, my King, within thy holy place. 24 Before went singers, afte they on Instruments that plai'd; Among them Damsels held their way, that hand on Timbrell laid. 25 In thine assembly let not thankes from God the Lord depart: O Fountaine, clos'd in Israels bankes, from fountaine of thy heart. 26 There, little Benjamin set hie, with Judahs Royall race; Of Zebulun, and Nephthali, the Princes crown'd the place. 27 Strength from his strength forth-issuing, thy Gods command hath brought; Establish thou, O God, the thing, that thou for us hast wrought. 28 And for Jerusalems deare sake, and for thy Temple there; To thee shall Kings their homage make, and humbly presents beare. 29 Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed, the Bulls incursions barre: Whose calves on silver fragments feed, disperse the friends of warre. 30 Sultans shall from Canôpus come, Cush, from Cassumo's Sunne, To God, on glad Ambassage home, with hands out-stretch't shall runne. 31 To God, on earth ye Kingdomes nie, to God like praises bring; In Psalmes sing to the Lord Most-Hie, your highest praises sing. Selah. 32 To him that on the Heavens doth ride, the Heav'ns that were of old; Loe, what he is, his voice hath tri'd, a voice of strength hath told. 33 To God give strength, that doth excell, from whom all strengths arise: Whose glory over Israel, whose strength is in the skies. 34 How dreadfull is, O God, thy sight, thy Sanctuaries tell: Blesse God, that gives his people might, the God of Israel. Psal. 69. Salvum me fac. Ad Præstantem super Sosannim, Davidis. 1 Save me, O God, the waters rise, so fast the flouds come on, That even unto my soules surprize, the swallowing gulfe is gone. 2 Downe in the mud I sinke so low, to stand I find no ground; So high the waves above me flow, so deep the surge to sound. 3 My weary spirit is spent with cries, my throat with scorching strait: My sight attentive, failes mine eies, while for my God I wait. 4 My head hath haters moe than haires, whom wrong upon me throwes; And power, that in my right impaires, in mine oppressors growes. 5 I paid them that I never tooke, what follies are in mee: What faults, when thou art pleas'd to looke, are knowne, O God, to thee. 6 Let not (Lord God of Hosts) my blame, abash thy servants care: O God of Israel, in my shame, let none that seeke thee, share. 7 For thy sake have I borne reproach, in me this blot thou hast: No covering else could shame encroach, upon my face to cast. 8 My brethren, no such brother know, no fremme, befriended lesse: My mothers children, none such owe, none more unwelcome guest. 9 Out-eaten with thy Houses zeale, mine earning heart is rent; And their reproaches on me steale, that at thy face were bent. 10 Mine eyes to weep, my soule to fast, was my reproach and shame; 11 And sackcloth on my shoulders cast, their jesting-stocke became. 12 Within the gate, did they that sit, against me set their tongue: Their tipling-talke, my troubles fit, I was the Drunkards song. 13 But, Lord, a gracious time assigne, to answer me with ruth: Thy mercies beames, O God, let shine, and thy salvations truth. 14 Deliver me out of the mire, my feet from sinking keep: Redeem me from my haters ire, and from these waters deep. 15 Let not the gulfie-mountaines tombe, her crest above me put: Let not the pits insatiate wombe, her mouth upon me shut. 16 Lord, answer me, for thou art kind, and gracious evermore: O turne thy face, that I may find thy tender mercy store. 17 And from thy servant cease to hide thy face in time of need: In my distresses springing tide, to answer me make speed. 18 Draw neere, my soule, and cleare the debt, for my redemption due: Deliver me, whom sore beset, mine enemies pursue. 19 Reproach and shame (thou know'st) have brought mine honour in disgrace: All this have my distressors wrought, and all before thy face. 20 Rebuke hath broken through my heart, some balme for sorrowes wound I sought; but none to salve my smart, no comforter I found. 21 For food to eate they gave me gall, my hungry taste to dine: For drinke, when, thirsty, I did call, they gave me eagre wine. 22 Let be their table made their snare, to trap themselves withall; And well what might have made them fare, be warp to make them fall. 23 Darke eies, let darker judgement bleare, nor sight, nor fore-sight take; And make their loines for guilty feare, continually to shake. 24 Thine indignation on them powre, with dread to strike them cold; Or let thy hot displeasures showre, upon their heads take hold. 25 Waste let their ruin'd Castle lie, no hand their soile manure: Nor Lord, nor Tenant hold thereby, no head their Tents endure. 26 For whom thou smit'st, they persecute; thou chastenest, they confound: And how to mischiefe they dispute, where thou hast made a wound. 27 From wickednesse to wickednesse, let their offences fall; And to thy Justice have accesse, of them let none at all. 28 Out of the Booke let them be crost, where thine Elected live; And with the Just no name engrost, of them no notion give. 29 As poore and pensive as I stand, thy saving healths supply, Let find, O God, a powerfull hand, to raise me up on hie. 30 To blesse thy Name, O God, will I a Psalme of praises bring; And with confession magnifie his mercy, whom I sing. 31 And this shall doe the Lord more good, and better please in proofe, Than tendrest Bullockes reeking blood, in pride of horne and hoofe. 32 To see this sight, with joy of heart, it shall transport the meeke: Your soule from life shall not depart, if after God ye seeke. 33 For to the poore the Lord gives eare, his prisoners cares to keep: 34 Heavens, Earth, and Seas, his praises beare, and all that in them creep. 35 For his Mount Sion God will save, and Judah's Cities build: That there their dwellings men may have, with heires of promise fill'd. 36 And of his servants shall the seed possesse the heritage: And they that love his Name, succeed therein, from age to age. Psal. 70. Deus in adjutorium. Ad Præstantem, Psal. Davidis, ad recordandum. 1 Now, now, in my extremes of need, O lose no time in waste; Deliver me, O God, with speed, to help me, Lord, make haste. 2 Shame and confusion on them lie, that seeke my soules annoy: Turn'd backe, and blushing let them flie, that in my evill joy. 3 Let this reward their wages pay, to send them backe with shame: Aha, in scorne to me that say, and make my griefe their game. 4 Let them that seeke thee, all alway, in thee with joy abide: Let thy Salvations lovers say still, God be magnifi'd. 5 To me, poore soule, so low downe cast, O God, make speed away: My help, and my deliverer haste, O Lord, make no delay. Psal. 71. In te Domine. 1 For ever, me, that in thee trust, Lord, let not shame deprave: 2 My plaintiffe-soule, as thou art just, deliver, heare, and save. 3 Be thou, where I may enter, still my Rocke of residence; To save me, is thy Precepts will, the Fort of my defence. 4 The raging hand, my God, becalme, assert my libertie, Safe, from the evill-doers palme, sow'r-leav'nd in crueltie. 5 For thou, Lord God, art of my rest the long-expected scope; Thou art my weaner from the breast, mine infant-ages hope. 6 My navill, since the wombe forsooke, thy hand did me uphold: Me, from my mothers bowels tooke, of thee, my praise still told. 7 As from a Monster, many eies, from me astonisht start: When strong distresse yet on me lies, my stronger hope thou art. 8 My mouth, no other musicke fill, no story stile my song; To descant of thy praise, my skill, thy glory, all day long. 9 O, cast me not in age away, when weaknesse strong assailes: Now leave me not to my decay, when strength enfeebled failes. 10 For they that bare me causlesse hate, (my foes) against me spake; And they that for my soule lay wait, together counsell take. 11 Since God (say they) doth him forsake, now left he is alone: On, on, him persecute, him take, to rescue him is none. 12 But goe not farre, O God, from me, nor fit occasion waste; At present need as present be, my God, to help me haste. 13 Confusion let confound them all, that to my soule are foes: Reproach, dishonour on them fall, that seeke my evill woes. 14 Yet shall my hope wait patiently upon thy help in store; And to thy praise, continually adde praises more and more. 15 Thy Justice-shall my mouth expresse, thy saving health all day: Whose numbers summe so numberlesse, my cyphers cannot say. 16 To sing thy power, this power of mine, how be'it (Lord God) too weake; Yet of thy Justice, only thine, somewhat, suffice, I speake. 17 My heart, O God, hast thou prepar'd, and from my childhood taught: And hither to have I declar'd, what wonders thou hast wrought. 18 And now, that I (O God) am old, mine Almond-tree growne gray: Mine age, from thee, let none behold, forsaken, sent away. 19 Till I have shew'd thine Armes extent unto this Ages view; And of thy power, a president, to all that shall ensue. 20 Thy Justice is in thee alone, O God, unto on hie: To those great acts which thou hast done, who like (O God) comes nie? 21 Thou shew'dst me many evill daies, much sorrow mad'st me see; From under ground yet didst thou raise, returne, and quicken mee. 22 To make me greater, far and wide thou gav'st me great encrease; To better me on every side, thy goodnesse did not cease. 23 Thee, and thy Truth, my God, to praise, not Psalterie alone; But Song and Harp will I up-raise, O Israels Holy-One. 24 With joy, above all joyes esteem'd, my lips shall shout to thee; So shall my soule, by thee redeem'd, in Psalmes as joyfull be. 25 My tongue, the Trumpet, shall proclaime thy Justice all the day: For they are blank't, and brought to shame, that seeke my soules decay. Psal. 72. Deus, Judicium. Solomoni. 1 O God, give Judgement to the King, thy Judgements depths to sound; And to the Kings son, Knowledge bring, where Justice may be found. 2 So, he that gives the life to Lawes, an upright hand shall beare: With Justice judge the peoples cause, the poore, with Judgement, heare. 3 The Mountaines, that in height excell, shall bring the people peace; The lesser Hills, that lower dwell, by Justice shall encrease. 4 Him, for their Judge the poore shall have, to crush the fraudulent: The sons of needy-soules to save, suppresse the violent. 5 And they with feare shall thee adore, when daies and nights are none; When Sun and Moon shall shine no more, when Ages all are gone. 6 He shall come downe, like soaking showers, in fleece-shorne medow mowne; Embroid'ring earth with fruits and flowers, on Summers mantle growne. 7 The Just shall flourish in his daies, and multitude of peace; Untill the Moones extinguisht raies, shall change, to change, and cease. 8 The utmost shoare, from sea to sea, shall be his Empires bound; And from Euphrates watrie-lea, as farre as earth hath ground. 9 The Ethiopian Sun-burnt Crust, shall (bow'd before him) kneele: His enemies shall licke the dust, that scatt'reth from his heele. 10 With presents, and with precious things, from Tharshish, and the Isles; From Sheba, and from Seba, Kings, shall measure worlds of miles. 11 All Kings (before whom subjects kneele) kneele downe, and serve him shall: All Nations, his dread Scepter feele, and downe before him fall. 12 For he that heares him, shall redeeme the needy, when he cries: The poore un-heeded soule esteem, and him that helplesse lies. 13 The simple he (with want, that strive) shall mercifully spare: Preserve the needy-soules alive, and for their safetie care. 14 Their soule from rapine he shall free, whom fraud or force betray: And precious in his eies shall be the bloud that they shall pay. 15 And he shall live, and Sheba's gold, to him shall men commend; And praiers for him continuall hold, to praise him all day spend. 16 A shocke of corne the Hills shall make, the Citie shall abound; Whose fruit, like Lebanon shall shake, and spring, as grasse on ground. 17 His Name (the Son) when Sun shall rest, shine fresh for ever shall: Yea, in his Name (and call him blest) be blest shall Nations all. 11 To God the Lord, the God in whom the sonnes of Israel live: From whom alone all wonders come, to him all blessings give. 19 Be ever blest his glorious Name, and by the sons of men, Let with his glory, earths whole frame be fill'd, Amen, Amen. 20 For Solomon his sonne to sing, this Psalme his father penn'd; So Davids praiers here did the King, the sonne of Jishai, end. Finis Libri secundi. Lib. III. Psal. 73. Quàm bonus Deus. Psalmus Asaphi. 1 Yet God to Israel is good, affects the pure in heart! 2 And I; my feet, but faltring stood, my steps were like to start. 3 I envi'd follies proud commands, the wickeds peace I saw: 4 For in their death there are no bands, but Lording-strength their Law. 5 Tell them of troubles, where, or when, for care they keep no roome; Nor are they plagu'd, like other men, neere them no crosse may come. 6 Of pride therefore a chaine hung downe, about their neckes they beare: And violences guarded gowne, the garment is they weare. 7 Their fat-swolne eyes beare out so bold, in plenty share such part: Their heaps no house enough to hold, their happinesse no heart. 8 Corrupt, in their licentious vaine, with their malicious tongue: Oppression proudly they maintaine, and highly boast of wrong. 9 Their mouth against the heavens they vent, to brave, blaspheme, and fling, Throughout the earth, till they have spent their tongues envenom'd sting. 10 His people therefore hither turne, and seeking like successe, Of waters wrung from their full urne, sucke up the bitternesse. 11 Tush, how should God, that comes not nie, (say they) such trifles know: Or how shall he, that is Most-Hie, esteem of things so low? 12 Loe, these the worlds ungodly guests, and there, these prosper best: Loe, these are they, that wealth possesse; Nay, are by wealth possest. 13 Now surely I, on poore pretence, have cleans'd my heart in vaine; And washt my hands in innocence, with labour for my paine. 14 And dieted I am all day with plagues, for my repast; And in the mornings, is my pay, rebuke, to breake my fast. 15 Thus, if I say, when I have said, How (faithlesse) I offend; And of thy sons, the race up-brai'd, and rashly reade their end? 16 Then thought I how to cleere this doubt, to sound this depth againe; But found it hard to find it out, and in mine eyes a paine. 17 Till to Gods holy House I went, and wisely did attend: Of these men, there, and their extent, I understood the end. 18 Them, surely, hast thou set aloft, on high, but slipp'ry seats: Whence, when they fall, they fall not oft, but soon thy hand defeats. 19 How suddenly left desolate, to ruine are they brought; How soon consum'd is their estate, with terrours over-wrought? 20 As, on the wing of fancy flies, a dreame from one awake; So, Lord, when up thou shalt arise, despis'd their image make. 21 My sowre-leav'nd heart did surely pant, my reines corrected mee: 22 So brutish I, so ignorant, was, as the beasts, with thee. 23 With thee, yet still did I abide, to thee, my right hand, cleave: Me, with thy counsell shalt thou guide, to glorie then receive. 24 In Heaven, what one have I, but thee, to whom my hopes suspire: 25 In earth, delights are none for mee, but thou, my lifes desire. 26 My flesh and heart, consum'd at length, as now, assist me not: But of my heart, the Rocke of strength, for ever, God my lot. 27 For loe, by thee be overthrowne, and perish shall each one, That are to Idols of their owne, from thee awhoring gone. 28 As for my good, I hold it best, neere God to draw my care: On God the Lord, my hopes to rest, and all thy workes declare. Psal. 74. Ut quid Deus? Admonitio Asaphi. 1 For ever! what doth thee provoke, from us cast off to keep? Still shall, O God, thy nostrils smoake, against thy pasture-sheep? 2 Thy Congregation call to mind, thy now forsaken fold, Whom thou, from bondage didst unbind, and purchast hast of old. 3 Thine Heritages rod redeem'd, among our fathers dealt: This Sion-Mount, so much esteem'd, the seat, where thou hast dwelt. 4 Lift up thy feet: Thy foe defeat for ever, every one: That to thy Sanctuaries seat have all this evill done. 5 Amidst thy holy places met, thine adversaries roare: Their Ensignes up for signes they set of conquest got before. 6 He that high groves of Cedars growne, with axe up-lifted fell'd, By much lesse loud report was knowne, like ours, no spoiler held. 7 And now they rend, and raze as fast, the roofes, the beames, lie broke, The carved columnes downe are cast, with maule and hammers stroke. 8 Thy Sanctuaries, set on fire, laid levell with the ground: The place profan'd, where thy desire to plant thy Name was found. 9 Let us (in heart, said they) make spoile, together them destroy: Unburnt, let God, in all the soile, no Synagogue enjoy. 10 Our signes, we see not! Prophet none, our Seers all among: Before our evill day be done, none left, that knowes how long. 11 How long, O God, of this our shame, shall our distressor dreame? How long, for ever, shall thy Name the Enemie blaspheme? 12 Why, turne thy hand? why, thy right hand held in thy bosome void? Why, this (while thou, withdrawne dost stand) Destroier undestroi'd? 13 For why? God is my King of old, by whom, Salvations wrought, Doe we, amidst the earth behold, as from their fountaine brought. 14 Through standing seas divided walls, thy power, thy peoples leads; And with thy batt'ring water-falls, thou break'st the Dragons heads. 15 Leviathans great heads (more great) thy surges swept away: Thou gav'st him to be peoples meat, the Desert-dwellers prey. 16 Thou mad'st out of the stony rocke whole flouds and fountaines flie; And through their laps, to lead thy flockes, drew'st mighty rivers drie. 17 Thine is the day, the night is thine, thou hast prepar'd the light: By day, the golden Sunne to shine, the silver Moone by night. 18 (The seas, shut up within their shores) thou quarter'st out the coasts: The Summers, and the Winters flow'rs, thou lay'st with fires and frosts. 19 Remember, Lord, how this reproach, the Enemie did frame: How foolish people did encroach, that durst blaspheme thy Name. 20 Thy Turtles soule commit thou not to be the wild beasts prey; Nor thine afflicted flocke, forgot, for ever cast away. 21 Unto thy Covenant have respect, for all the earth is darke; And here, her roofes hath rapine deck't, oppression set her marke. 22 O, let not thine opprest depart, repuls't with brand of shame: But let the poore afflicted heart, and needy, praise thy Name. 23 Arise, O God, thy plea proceed, to plead without delay, Remember how the foole-mad breed, reproach thee all the day. 24 Forget not, of thine enemies, the voice that thee offends: Their tumult, that against thee rise, continually ascends. Plal. 75. Confitebimur tibi. Ad Præstantem. Ne corrumpas. Psalmus Asaphi, Canticum. 1 To thee, O God, our thankes confesse, thy praise we celebrate; And neere to us thy Names accesse, thy wondrous workes relate. 2 When time shall bring about the day, that I the Rule receive: With Justice will I guide the way, and righteous Judgement give. 3 The earth, and earths in-dwellers all, dissolv'd, and downe are cast: Her shaken fabricke, from to fall, her pillars I set fast. Selah. 4 To mad-proud fooles I said, Beware, let folly be forborne; And to the wicked, Have a care, ye lift not up the Horne. 5 Fooles, heave not up your Horne on hie, lest Heaven your Antliers checke: Your words on lowly wing let flie, not with a stiffe-borne necke. 6 For, neither from the East nor West, nor Hills, high-callings come: But God the Judge, “Some humbleth best, “Exalteth other some. 7 For, in his hand the Lord doth beare a cup, whose wine is red; And full of mixture is the Mere by him distributed. Of indignation in this cup, on earth, the wicked all, Wring-out the dregs, and drinke them up, depriv'd of mercy shall. 8 But I, for ever will declare, and Hymnes of gladnesse bring: Which I, for praises shall prepare, to Jacobs God to sing. 9 And of the wicked, every horne, I from their heads will rend: When high shall every beame be borne, that forth the Just shall send. Psal. 76. Notus in Judea. Ad Præstantem, in Neghinoth. Psalmus Asaphi, Canticum. 1 In Judah God is knowne, his Name is great in Israel: 2 His Tent in Salem: He the same, that doth in Sion dwell. 3 The burning arrowes, there he brake, shot from the bow-mans hand: The sword and shield, made field forsake, and warlike bands dis-band. Selah. 4 Much brighter shines thy Glories Crowne, than brightnesse shines by day: Thine Excellence of more renowne, than are the Mounts of prey. 5 There, mighty-hearted men lay foil'd, and falling, slept their sleep: The men of power, of power, found spoil'd, which none found hands to keep. 6 O God of Jacob, thy reproofe, sent many a daring head: Chariot and Horse, with thundring hoofe, to sleep among the dead. 7 Thou, thou art to be fear'd alone, for thy resistlesse might: And in thy wrath, from then, what one shall stand before thy sight? 8 From Heaven, to have thy Judgement heard, it was thy dreadfull will; And at thy thundring voice afeard, earth trembled, and was still. 9 When God in Judgement rose, to save the meeke on earth, un-slaine: Selah. Praise of mans rage, thou sure shalt have, the rest thou shalt restraine. 10 Vow to the Lord your God, and pay, all round about him neere; Your present in the presence lay, of Jacobs Fathers Feare. The spirit of Princes rank-growne pride, his gathering spirit shall prune: That is, on earth an awfull guide, to keep their Kings in tune. Psal. 77. Voce mea ad Dominum. Ad Præstantem, super Jeduthun, Asaphi Psalmus. 1 I with my voice to God did crie, so loud, that he might heare: My voice to God I rais'd on hie, and he to me gave eare. 2 While day to my distresse gave light, unto the Lord I mourn'd: My restlesse sore ran out by night, my soule from comfort turn'd. 3 I thought on God: My troubled thought betooke me no reliefe: My spirit complain'd, but over-wrought was my complaint with griefe. Selah. 4 Thou heldst my heavie eyes awake, while I, with watching, weake, Would rest; but rest I could not take, astonish't, could not speake. 5 I thought upon the daies of old, their compleat summe to cast; And of our fathers ages told, what yeeres in number past. 6 I call'd to mind my song by night, I commun'd with my heart; And throughly out to search my spirit, bare every part a part. 7 For ever, will the Lord, displeas'd, cast off, and not restore: And will his anger, unappeas'd, adde no acceptance more? 8 For ever, is his Mercy done, his Word, to ceasing put; 9 His Grace, hath God forgot so soon, in wrath his Bowells shut? Selah. 10 Or, is my sicknesse this, (said I) that I so late began: Of his right hand, that is Most-Hie, the changing turnes to skan? 11 To my remembrance will I call, what workes the Lord hath wrought, What wonders did of late befall, will ponder in my thought. 12 Of all thy workes will I advise, and as I meditate, Make my discourses exercise, thy doings to relate. 13 Most Holy is (O God) thy way, thy Sanctuaries seat; Thy Second, whom can any say, as God, a God so great? 14 Thou art the God; that Strength, thou art, that strange designes hast showne; And of thy power, hast made thy part, among the people knowne. 15 Thy peoples generations, thine arme redeem'd of old: Thy Jacobs, and thy Josephs sons, whom Josephs brethren sold. 16 Thy face, O God, the waters saw, the waters saw thy face; The trembling waters stood in awe, the groaning deeps gave place. 17 The clouds on earth, their tempests powr'd, the skies gave out a sound: Thine arrowes from the quiver showr'd, made seas on seas rebound. 18 Thy thunder-shot roar'd round about, the world with lightnings shone; The earth was stirr'd, and shooke, in doubt, her day-light lamp was gone. Yea, even this dreadfull glimm'ring light, glad comfort gave their eie; That in this darknesse-double-night, yet let them see to die. 19 Thy way, is in the sea aside, on heaps divided throwne: Thy pathes through many waters guide, thy footsteps are not knowne. 20 Thou leadst thy people through the Land, as Shepheard leads his sheep: By Moses, and by Aarons hand, thy flocke ordain'd to keep. Psal. 78. Attendite, Popule. Admonitio Asaphi. 1 My Law, that I shall give in charge, O ye my people, heare: To what my lips shall speake at large, incline your heedfull eare. 2 A Parable my mouth shall shew, darke mysteries of old, 3 What we have heard, and knowne, renew, as have our fathers told. 4 Which of the Ages sons un-borne, we will conceale from none, What Crownes of praise the Lord hath worne, what powerfull wonders done? 5 A Covenant he with Jacob strooke, gave Israel a Law: Wherein, strait charge our fathers tooke, to hold their sons in awe. 6 That their Posteritie might know, and learne by them alive: From seed to seed rise up and sowe, from sonne to sonne derive. 7 On God, their hopes that they might set, Gods acts charactred deep Within their breast, might not forget, and his Commandments keep. 8 Not, as their fathers disobey'd, a race that did rebell: A race, from God, whose heart un-stai'd, whose spirit unfaithfull, fell. 9 Such as the sons of Ephraim were, that arm'd, and bearing bow, Flung downe their armes, and fled for feare before the signall-blow. 10 Of God, the Covenant kept they not, his Precepts pathes eschew'd: 11 What deeds he did for them, forgot what wondrous workes he shew'd. 12 What wonders in their fathers sight, sad proofe can Egypt yeeld, Whereto, though Misraim all, had right, most right had Zoan field. 13 The sea for them did he divide, and made them passage all: He heap't the waters side by side, to stand, as wall by wall. 14 A cloud all day, their course to keep, all night, a light of fire: 15 From Desert-rockes, as from the Deep, gave drinke at their desire. 16 Swift streames out of the Rocke he brought, that forth like rivers flie: 17 Their sinne, on sinne, in Desert wrought, provok't, yet, God Most-Hie. 18 And, tempting God, with grudging hearts, their soule requiring meat: 19 Shall God (said they) in Desert parts, on tables set to eate? 20 Behold, he smote the stony Rocke, whence flow'd those streames afresh: But can he for his peopled flocke find bread, or furnish flesh? 21 This heard the Lord; but heard with wrath, the fire that Jacob blew: For this ingratefull breach of troth, on faithlesse Israel flew. 22 For they to God no faith had given, nor his salvation trust: 23 Though clouds enjoyn'd, &amp; doors of Heaven, lay open to their lust. 24 He, Manna downe on them did raine, their hunger to suffice; And gave them of that Heavenly graine, from Garners of the skies. 25 That man, the Mighties Bread might eate, it was his Makers will: Who sent them this Celestiall meate, of Angels food, their fill. 26 He, from Heavens Nabathean mouth, his East wind made to blow: His power brought from Sabean South, a softer gale to glow. 27 He rain'd downe flesh, the Desert dust, to number, is not more; And feathred-fowle, to fill their lust, as sand, on sea-driv'n shore. 28 He made it fall, his Camp throughout, so bigge the cloud did swell; His habitations round about, the feathred-tempest fell. 29 So they did eate, and had their fill, their lust, so highly priz'd, Had what they would, yet, not their will; were cloi'd, but not suffic'd. 30 While yet the meat was in their mouth, Gods wrath upon them came; And slew the fat of all their youth, the hopes of Israels name. 31 This done, yet sinn'd they more and more, the more their God to grieve: His wonders slighting, as before, nor would they yet beleeve. 32 He therefore did consume their daies in vanitie, their yeeres, Not close, with Ages kind decaies, but crosse, with hasty feares. 33 On them, when slaughters hand he brought, then home to him retir'd: Then sought him, early then him sought, then after God enquir'd. 34 That God was then their Rocke of strength, they could remember well; And that the Highest God, at length, was their Redeemer, tell. 35 Yet did their mouth but faigne the while, this was but flatt'ries gloze, Their tongue fram'd this alluring stile, these lies with him to close. 36 Their heart with him was wrong within, his Covenants faith forgot: His Mercy covered yet their sin, and them corrupted not. 37 How often his compassions wing, could wind his wrath aside; And on their heads forbeare to bring, his whole displeasures tide. 38 Remembring that they were but flesh, a vapour, whift away: Whose flower may never spring, refresh, but once, and soon decay. 39 How often did they him provoke, the Wildernesse can speake: How often his displeasures stroke, the Deserts saw him breake. 40 Yet turning backe, to sinne they fell, and tempting God againe: The Holy-One of Israel, their limits would containe. 41 Nor minded they his Mighty hand, nor their Redemption-day: When he them freed from Pharaoh's Land, from bondage sent away. 42 What strange designes in Egypt done, what wonders Zoan-plaines: All Ages wonder, equall none, and Memphis yet complaines. 43 He turn'd their rivers into bloud, that thirst it selfe did shrinke, In plenty, poore; of Nilus floud when Egypt could not drinke. 44 Devouring flies, promiscuous swarmes, to eate them up, he sent; And fenny frogs importune charmes, corrupting, where they went. 45 He let the Caterpiller eate the fruit of all their soile; And gave their labours hopefull sweat, to be the Locusts spoile. 46 Their Vines, with haile-stones he destroi'd, their Sycamores with frost: 47 With haile, their heards, their flocks annoi'd, in flames of lightning lost. 48 His indignations fi'rie stripes, his fury on them spent; And guilty-soules tormenting gripes, by evill Angels sent. 49 He spared not their soule from death, to weigh his angers way, Made man and beast give up their breath, the Pestilences prey. 50 The first of all in Egypt borne, unequall death prevents; The Principall of strength, the Horne, where Cham had pitch't his Tents. 51 But forth, like sheep, from tempest fled, he made his people passe; And, like a flocke in Deserts led, as in deep pasture grasse. 52 He led them safe, and free from feare, their walkes were through the waves; But drown'd their foes, that here and there had made the sea their graves. 53 And them, he to his Rocke of rest, his holy Border, brought, This Mountaine lov'd above the best, and with his right hand bought. 54 Before them, out the Heath'ns he cast, and shar'd their lot by line; Where Anak raign'd in Ages past, the shields of Jacob shine. 55 Ingratefull they, their God Most-Hie, yet tempt, afresh provoke: His Testimonies naught set by, with them can beare no stroke. 56 They turne their backes, disloyall grow, and flie their fathers flight: “So starts aside the warping bow, the Archer aiming right. 57 And now, to grate his angry gall, Hill-Altars, Idoll-Groves, Grav'n-Imagery, whereto they fall, his jealous fury moves. 58 This, hearing God, his wrath grew hot, so foule revolt to heare; So Israel his hatred got, his people held so deare. 59 His Tabernacle he forsooke, that Shilo lov'd so well; His Tabernacle, where he tooke delight with men, to dwell. 60 His Arke, his Monument of Power, he left in captive bands; And gave his Glories beauteous flowre into Distressors hands. 61 He chain'd his people to the chance of Tyrants raging blade; And wroth with his Inheritance, their heads the hostage made. 62 Their young men were untimely driven, of fire to be the food: Their virgins not in marriage given, nor by their praisers woo'd. 63 Their Priests annointed, slaine with glaves, and laid on bloudy Beers: No widowes, on their wedlockes graves, to melt some mourning teares. 64 So wak't the Lord, as after sleep, the rowzed sp'rits refine: Or, as a Giant, sowsed deep in lavish cups of wine. 65 With Hemorroids, on their parts behind, his enemies he smote; And branded them, and all their kind, with shames eternall note. 66 For Josephs Tent he did refuse, or Ephraims Tribe to move: 67 But Judah's Royall Tribe did chuse, and Sion-Mount his love. 68 There, built his Temples Hornes on hie, his Holy-place so sure, That founded to Eternitie, might firme, as earth, endure. 69 His servant David (hooke and sling) he drew from folds of sheep; And of a Shepherd, made a King, a flocke of soules to keep. 70 From following Ewes, with young ones great, of Jacobs chosen seed: Possest him of a Regall-seat, his Israel to feed. And them within this Holy Land, with perfect heart he fed: Them, with a prudent Pastors hand, (his flocke) discreetly led. Psal. 79. Deus, venerunt. Psalmus Asaphi. 1 Thine Heritage, O God, expil'd, invading Heath'ns laid waste: Thine Holy place have they defil'd, on heapes have Salem cast. 2 The carkasse of thy servants, meat given to the fowle of Heaven; And of thy Saints, the flesh to eate, to earths wild beast is given. 3 Their bloud, about thy Salem, round, like waters have they shed, Profanely left above the ground, their bones un-buried. 4 Our neighbours neere, on every side, reproach us face to face; And round about us scorne, deride, and load us with disgrace. 5 How long? for ever, Lord, how long, before thine anger turne? O, shall thy jealousie so strong, like fire for ever burne? 6 Upon the Heath'n powre out thy wrath, and make their Kingdomes flame, Whose heart of thee no knowledge hath, that call not on thy Name. 7 For, they have eat up Jacobs race, his seed, by sword devour'd; And on his wasted dwelling place, their fire and fury powr'd. 8 Call not our former sins to mind, with speed some mercy shew; Prevent us with thy bowells kind, whose losse hath brought us low. 9 Help us, God of our health, and make thy Name the glory share: Deliver us, for thy Names sake, our sins in mercy spare. 10 For why live we, to see this day, to beare this by-word home; To heare the Heath'n-blasphemer say, Where is their God become? To Heath'ns let this be understood, before our eyes be read; How deare thy vengeance sells the blood of us thy servants shed. 11 Let prisoners sighes, yet reeking warme, before thee bring their breath: According to thy powerfull arme, reserve the sons of death. 12 And their reproach, which to our paine, our neighbours on thee lay; Into their bosome, Lord, againe, with seven-fold paine repay. 13 So we, thy peoples pasture sheep, shall ever of thy praise, With thankfull Hymnes, Memorials keep, to Age, and Age of daies. Psal. 80. Qui regis Israel. Ad Præstantem, super Sosannim Gheduth. Asaphi Psalmus. 1 Shepheard of Israel, give eare, That Joseph, like a sheep, dost lead, That sitt'st upon the winged-chaire, The Cherubims, cleare up thy head. 2 Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, Before Manasseh, to us come; Stirre up thy mighty strength herein, And for salvation bring us home. 3 To shew, that saving health is thine, Turne us, O turne to us againe: Cause thou thy face on us to shine, Salvation so shall we attaine. 4 Lord God of Hosts, how long wilt thou, In these extremes of our affaires, Hot-smoaking bend thine angry brow, Against thy peoples humble praiers? 5 Thou mak'st them eate the bread of teares, Of teares, to drinke in measure great, 6 Our neighbours strife to fill our eares, With scorne, our foes us foule entreat. 7 To shew, that saving health is thine, O God of Hosts, turne us againe, Cause thou thy face on us to shine, Salvation so shall we attaine. 8 A Vine from Egypt hast thou brought, The Heath'ns dis-planted by thy hand, 9 Before thy plant the way hast wrought, Which, taking root, hath fill'd the Land. 10 The Hills were covered with the shade, That from her fanne of leaves did fall; For cold, for heat, kind shelter made, Her stature, like Gods Cedars, tall. 11 Her branches bound the sea, a Crowne, Her boughes be-deck't Euphrâtes shore: 12 Her hedge, why hast thou broken downe, That passers-by, her clusters tore? 13 To root it up, the woods wild Boare, To rend it downe, the fields wild Beasts, All glutted with her purple gore, Were this faire Vines unfitting guests. 14 Returne, O God of Hosts, and now, With eyes, than light, that brighter shine, Looke downe from Heaven upon this bough, Behold, and visit thou this Vine. 15 This Vine, the strength of thy right hand, Stock, burnt with fire, the boughes cut downe; 16 Sonne, for thy selfe made strong to stand, They perish at thy faces frowne. 15 Upon the Man of thy right hand, O let thy hand continue long; Upon the Son of man let stand, Whom for thy selfe thou mad'st so strong. 18 So no revolt of ours shall give, Our backes to thee, to brand with shame, O, quicken us, and we shall live; And living, call upon thy Name. 19 To shew, that saving health is thine, Lord God of Hosts, turne us againe; And cause on us thy face to shine, Salvation so shall we attaine. Psal. 81. Exultate Deo. Ad Præstantem, super Gittith, Asaphi. 1 To God, our strength, with joyfull voice, in triumph let us sing: To Jacobs God, with echoing noise, make we the aire to ring. 2 Take up the Psalmes sweet melodie, the sounding Timbrell bring: The pleasant Harp, the Psalterie, straine voice, and wind, and string. 3 Blow up the Trumpet, when the Moone, her silver hornes renewes: At solemne feast, as to have done, on our high day we use. 4 For this a statute was ordain'd, to Israel fore-told: A Rite to Jacobs God retain'd, for Jacobs sons to hold. 5 In Joseph was this witnesse cleer'd, when he from Pharaoh's land Went forth, a language there I heard, I did not understand. 6 “I eas'd him of the burthen there, that on his shoulders lay; His palmes by me delivered were, from carrying hods of clay. 7 Thou call'dst me in distresse, thy yoke of bondage I remov'd; To thee in cloud of thunder spoke, at Meribah thee prov'd. Selah. 8 Heare, O my people, my Record, and I will witnesse beare; O Israel, to this my word, give thou but heedfull eare. 9 Strange God in thee there shall none be, nor worship shalt thou spend, To any other God but me, thine humbled knee to bend. 10 I, that from Egypt up thee brought, the Lord thy God am still; Whom land nor sea can fill, thy throat wide open, I shall fill. 11 But this my people would not heare, my voice could not attone; Of me, for favour nor for feare, my Israel would none. 12 On this revolt, and breach of trust, did I from him depart; And sent them, to pursue their lust, the counsels of their heart. 13 O, had their eare my people bent, in their declining daies, Had Israel his wandrings spent in walking in my waies. 14 Their foes I should have soon put downe, that now against them stand; On their distressors heads have throwne my wraths directed hand. 15 The haters of the Lord, with lies, confounded had been found; But of their favour, in his eies, had boundlesse been the bound. 16 With fat of wheat would I have fed his hunger, highly priz'd; And from the Rocke, with honey shed, would I have thee suffic'd. Psal. 82. Deus stetit in Synagoga. Psalmus Asaphi. 1 With Princes (peoples heads) the head of Princes, God doth stand, Great Judge amidst the gods to plead, with Judges of the land. 2 How long will ye Judge evill good, in wrongs no measure kept: Of wicked heads, preferre the hood, the faces, well accept? 3 The weake, and fatherlesse befriend, that Justice judge them right; The needy and distrest defend, from over-bearing might. 4 The weakling, and the poore discharge, that they may live un-harm'd, Them, from the powerfull hand enlarge, which wickednesse hath arm'd. 5 They know not, neither understand, their walkes in darknesse end: Move all foundations of the Land, it moves them not to mend. 6 That ye are Gods, so said have I, sons of the Highest, all: 7 Yet sure, ye Gods, like men shall die, and, one with Princes, fall. 8 Great Judge on earth, of Kingdomes King, thy selfe, O God, advance: For, all the Nations shalt thou bring to thine Inheritance. Psal. 83. Deus, quis? Canticum Psalmi Asaph. 1 Cease not, as deafe, O God, so long, so long hold not thy peace: In silence still keep not thy tongue, O God, thy ceasing cease. 2 For loe, thy foes a tumult make, their troupes against us lead; And they that hate thee, for our sake, have lifted up their head. 3 Against thy people they discourse, in consultations: Contriving fraud with open force, against thy secret ones. 4 Come, Let us cut them off (they said) that Nation never more, Nor name of Israel decai'd, remembring Age restore. 5 For they have cast with one consent, and strooke a league in heart, Their powerfull armes against thee bent, against us to convert. 6 The Tents of Edom, Ismaelites, with Moabs mis-borne breed: The Hagarens, the Gebalites, and peopled Ammons seed. 7 With them doth Amalek conspire, with them Pelesheth runs: Ashur, with them that dwell at Tyre, arme Lots rebellious sons. Selah. 8 Such end doe thou upon them bring, as Madian Princes tooke: Like Sisara, like Jabin King, that fell at Kishon brooke. 9 Which perished on Endor plaine, where (monuments of shame) In dust and bloud, their bodies slaine, as dung on earth became. 10 Let Oreb, and let Zeeb fore-tell theirs, and their Princes fall: As Zebach, and Zalmunnah fell, so fall their Princes all. 11 Which said, “Our Houses to advance, Gods Houses let us take; And heires of his Inheritance, our heires succeeding, make. 12 Make like a wheele, my God, the race of their outragious lives; Or, as the winds distemp'red face, the withered stubble drives. 13 As fire, that burneth up the wood, and bares the thickest hold; Or, as the flame devoures for food the Mountaines sulphur-mold. 14 So with thy tempests wrath dismai'd, pursue them to the death; And make them with thy storme afraid, to draw their guilty breath. 15 Their brazen faces, brands of shame, their soules, of sorrow, beare, That they, O Lord, may seeke thy Name, if not for love, for feare. 16 Confusion sudden evermore, and trouble them torment; And give their sinfull lives before, a shamefull deaths event. 17 That they may know, that thou alone, whose name is Eternall, On earth thy foot-stoole, Heaven thy Throne, Most-Hie art over all. Psal. 84. Quàm dilecta? Ad Præstantem, super Gittith. Filiorum Choreh Psalmus. 1 How amiable (Lord of Hosts) thy dwelling places are? How farre above all other coasts, thy Tents exceed compare? 2 Lord, of thy Courts, to joy the fight, my longing soule suspires, My flesh, my heart, above delight, the living God desires. 3 The Sparrow finds a roome to rest, from reach of common wrong: The Swallow builds a curious nest, where she may couch her young. 4 They, Lord of Hosts, within thy roofe, even to thine Altars home, My King, my God, without reproofe, (O me excluded) come. 5 With them, what blessings dwellers are, that in thy dwellings dwell: A house for thee, their hearts prepare, thy praises shall they tell. Selah. 6 They through the vale of Baca goe, where teares find comforts spring; And showers, to quench the sighes of woe, in cisterns, blessings bring. 7 So marching on, from strength to strength, them shall their vigour beare; Till to the God of Gods, at length, in Sion they appeare. 8 Lord God of Hosts, from Heaven thy seat, my supplication heare: To what my praiers of thee entreat, O Jacobs God, give eare. 9 See who it is that sues for grace, see whom thou hast forsooke: O God, our shield, upon the face of thine annointed looke. 10 For, in thy Courts the sweet content, that one day spent, commends; Is better than a thousand spent, that elsewhere any spends. More in thine House love I their roome, that at thy threshold sit; Than in their Tents, my God, to come, that wickednesse commit. 11 For God the Lord, our Sun and Shield, will grace and glory give; And no good thing withhold to yeeld, to them that perfect live. 12 O Lord of Hosts, thy Arme of Power, that Armies powers doth bend; Shall on the man thy blessings powre, whose hopes on thee depend. Psal. 85. Benedixisti Domine. Ad Præstantem, filiis Choreh, Psalmus. 1 Now art thou gracious Lord become, unto thy chosen Land: Thou hast return'd thy Jacob home, redeem'd from captive hand. 2 Thy peoples faults hast thou forgiven, and covered all their sin: Thy furious wrath away hast driven, and call'd thine anger in. 3 O God of our salvation, see, our former cares encrease: Turne thou to us, turne us to thee, thine indignation cease. 4 For ever wilt thou be displeas'd with us, and never end? Wilt thou, thine anger un-appeas'd, to Age and Age extend? 5 Wilt thou not once returne againe, and us to life restore; That we, thy peoples poore remaine, may joy in thee therefore? 6 Severely, Lord, as thou hast dealt, to us thy mercy shew: Thy heavie hand, as we have felt, thy saving health bestow. 7 To heare what God the Lord will speake, with heed will I attend: Whose promise he will never breake, but with performance end. For he will cause our pressures cease, and comfort such as mourne; And to his gracious Saints speake peace, lest they to folly turne. 8 His saving health, sure neere at hand, shall they that feare him win: That glory may in-dwell our land, inglorious made by sin. 9 With Mercy, Truth in one did meet, and hands together strike; Where Justice, Peace with kisse did greet, and peace return'd the like. 10 Truth, Heaven her place of birth forsooke, out of the earth shall spring; And Justice downe from Heaven shall looke, a heav'n on earth to bring. 11 The Lord his goodnesse shall expresse, so shall our Land not cease; The Lord with blessings us to blesse, our Laud with fruits encrease. 12 Before his face shall Justice goe, and in the way respect, To put her order'd footsteps so, as he shall them direct. Psal. 86. Inclina Domine. Oratio Davidis. 1 Incline thine eare, O Lord, to mee, and heare my humble praier: For poore and needy, I to thee, for answer make repaire. 2 Thee, let my soule her keeper have, for mercifull am I: Thou, O my God, thy servant save, whose hopes on thee relye. 3 Upon thee all day calls my voice, Lord, for thy Graces gift: 4 O, make thy servants soule rejoyce, which, Lord, to thee I list. 5 For thou, O Lord, art good to all, and ready to forgive; And much in mercy, all that call upon thee, to relieve. 6 Give eare, Lord, what my praier requires, in these extremes of mine; And of my humble-ey'd desires, unto the voice encline. 7 I, in the day of my distresse, will call aloud to thee; Nor doubt accesse, nor good successe, for thou wilt answer mee. 8 Among the Gods, O Lord, is none with thee that can compare: Nor like the workes that thou hast done, workes done by any are. 9 All people, Lord, whom thou hast fram'd, shall come and worship thee; And glorious shall thy Name be nam'd, by Nations all that be. For, great thou art, as we have found, by those great marvels done: That neither equall hast, nor bound, thou God, thy selfe alone. 10 My walkes, Lord, in thy way so fit, and in thy truth so frame; My heart to thee so firmly knit, that I may feare thy Name. 11 To sing, O Lord my God, thy praise, my heart shall wholly tend; And to thy Name such glory raise, as never shall have end. 12 For towards me thy mercy great, no measure may esteem; And from in Hell the lowest seat, my soule didst thou redeem. 13 The proud, O God, against me rise, and force with falshood met, Have sought to make my soule their prize, nor thee before them set. 14 Thy pity, streames, Lord God, so strong, as no compassion such: Thy grace abundant, suffrance long, thy Truth and Mercy much. 15 O turne thy face to me at length, as grace hath well begun; To me thy servant give thy strength, and save thy hand-maids son. Some signe, for good, upon me shew, which let my haters see; And blush, when thou, O Lord, they know, didst help and comfort mee. Psal. 87. Fundamenta eius. Filiis Choreh. Psalmus Cantici. 1 Low, where the hallowed Mountaines fall, lie his foundation-plates: 2 Much more than Jacobs dwellings all, the Lord loves Sion gates. 3 Like glorious things have not been heard, nor moderne, nor of old; To God, thou City most endear'd, as have of thee been told. Selah. 4 In my remembrance Rahab runnes, and Babel, knowing mee: Loe Palestine, and Tyre, thy sonnes, with Cush, there borne was hee. 5 And of thee, Sion, shall be said, the mother of us all, Whom the Most-Hie so firme hath laid, shall man and man thee call. 6 With him, when he the peoples writes, the Lord shall first begin; And say, when he their names recites, This man was borne therein. Selah. 7 Singers, and Instruments that sound, rejoycers all with mee: Voice, string, wind, water-falls abound, “My springs are all in thee. Psal. 88. Domine, Deus salutis. Canticum Psalmi, filiis Choreh, ad Præstantem, super Mahalath Lignanoth, Maschil, Heman Israïtæ. 1 My crying supplication, Before thee day and night, Lord God of my salvation, 2 Let enter in thy sight. Encline thine eare, and heare mee, My soules full troubles tell, 3 Whose evills trench so neere me, My life drawes neere to Hell. 4 Like them to death betaken, That downe the pit are gone, I seem a man forsaken; A strength, that strength hath none. 5 Among the dead, free-sleeping, That in the grave lie slaine, Which (cast out of thy keeping) Cut from the hand remaine. 6 My head thou hast captived Within the lowest pit, Where I of light deprived, In deeps of darknesse sit. 7 Thy furies heat inflicted, Lies heavie on my crowne, With all thy flouds afflicted, Thy billowes beare me downe. Selah. 8 Set farre from mine acquaintance, To them thou hast me set, Abhorr'd, shut up in durance, Whence out I cannot get. 9 Faint-ey'd, to tuning fall I, Afflictions sobs my Psalmes, On thee, Lord, all day call I, To thee I spread my palmes. 10 Wilt thou from deaths vast Regions, Prodigious shadowes raise; Of all those Idoll-legions, What one shall sing thy praise? 11 And shall thy loving kindnesse, Within the garve be told? Or shall ABADDON'S blindnesse, Thy faithfulnesse unfold? 12 Thy deeds of Admiration Shall Darknesse bring to light? Who in Oblivions Nation, Thy Justice shall recite? 13 But, Lord, to thee sincerely My plaint doe I present; And in the morning early, My prai'r shall thee prevent. 14 Why, Lord, dost thou reject mee? Why lay my soule aside? Why let thine eare neglect mee? Thy face why dost thou hide? 15 Afflicted soule, deceasing, Thy ceaslesse stripes I beare, From since my youths increasing, Distraction, doubtfull feare. 16 Thine angers overgrow mee, Thy frightings mee dismay: 17 All round they overflow mee, Like waters, all the day. 18 From mee thou hast removed My friends, my knowne delight, My lovers, my beloved, Are darknesse in my sight. Psal. 89. Misericordias Domini. Maschil, Etan Esraitæ. 1 The tender mercies of the Lord shall ever be my song; So shall my mouth thy truths record, to age and age prolong. 2 For mercy shall be built (I said) eternall to endure: The Heav'ns establisht hast thou laid, then Heav'n, thy truth more sure. 3 The Covenant with thy chosen strooke, shall in my mind be borne: The oath, which I to David tooke, to him my servant sworne. 4 For ever, of thy seed to reigne, will I establish one; To Age and Age that shall remaine, will I build up thy Throne. Selah. 5 In speechlesse speech the Heav'ns, O Lord, thy wondrous workes confesse; The Saints Assemblies, of thy Word declare the faithfulnesse. 6 For who in Heav'ns high Mansions may with the Lord compare? Or who among the mighties sons, can equall lordship share? 7 God is exceeding dreadfull, where his Saints their secret hold; And round about him full of feare, all-over to behold. 8 Lord God of Hosts, All-powerfull Lord, what power is like to thine? The splendour of whose faithfull Word, doth round about thee shine. 9 Thou rul'st the swelling of the Seas, proud billowes of the Maine; Their waves high-rising to appease, and still their stormes againe. 10 The Pharian Rahab didst thou smite, as one that wounded lies: Thou scatt'redst with thine arme of might thy mighty enemies. 11 Thine are the Heav'ns, the earth is thine, the world thy Word did found; And all within the vast Machine, the plenty of this Round. 12 Thee, North and South, Creatour call, to sing thy Name they run: From Westerne Tabors shady fall, from Chermons rising Sun. 13 Thou hast a Mighty Armes command, extended farre and nie: Of strength resistlesse is thy hand, and thy right hand is hie. 14 With Justice Judgement, Bases stand, supporters of thy Throne; And Truth with Mercy, hand in hand, before thy face are gone. 15 O people blest, that know aright the Trumpets joyfull sound; Still walking in thy faces light, shall they, O Lord, be found. 16 For in thy Name shall they delight, all day remembring thee; And in thy Justice made upright, shall they exalted be. 17 The glory of their strength thou art, to us thy favour borne, Shall be the strengthner of our heart, up-lifter of our Horne. 18 Suffice it, that the Lord alone in our defence we bring: Our shield is of the Holy One of Israel, our King. 19 In Vision, to thy Holy One, then spake thy Spirit, and said, My help have I, to hold the Throne, on one, made Mighty, laid. 20 One of the people, rais'd to lead my flocke, did I appoint, My servant David, and his head, my holy oile annoint. 21 With whom my hand shall be so strong, that strengthned with my arme, Him, nor exacting foe shall wrong, nor sonne of evill harme. 22 And his distressors, from his face, with strokes will I beat downe; And give my plague a lighting place upon his haters crowne. 23 My faithfulnesse shall be the same, with him my mercy rest; His Horne shall flourish in my Name, with high-exalted crest. 24 From shore to shore, from land to land, enrich't with unbought goods, I in the sea will set his hand, his right hand in the floods. 25 Himselfe the issue of my stocke, my sonne, and me he shall, My father thou, my God, the Rocke of my salvation call. 26 And him the first-borne will I give, the Kings of earth above; With him my love shall ever live, my Covenant faithfull prove. 27 And in their changes to succeed, when times and times are done; For ever will I set his seed, as daies of Heav'n his Throne. 28 But if my Law his sons forsake, my Judgements walke beside; Profane my Statutes, faile to take my Precepts for their guide. 29 To visit their misdeeds will I then with the rod begin; Lay stripes on their iniquitie, and scourge them for their sin. 30 My mercy yet shall no repeale, to part from him prevaile; Nor I with him will falsly deale, against my faith, nor faile. 31 My covenant shall no change profane, what league my lips did tye: My Holinesse once swore in vaine, if I to David lye. 32 His seed shall ever be: His Throne before me shall appeare, Like Heav'ns bright paire, the Sun, the Moone, that faithfull witnesse beare. 34 But thine Annointed left forsooke, thy wrath hath beaten downe; The Covenant of thy servant broke, profan'd on earth his Crowne. 35 His hedges all hath overthrowne, wide open flung his folds, Where any fort of his was knowne, to ruine brought his holds. 36 All passengers of him make prey, to neighbours neerer home An object, he of scorne and play a loud reproach become. 37 His foes right hand hast thou up-set, his hands successe to crosse: Their joy, his joyes from him to get, their laughter made his losse. 38 His swords keen edge didst thou abate, his hand in battell bound; Hast made to cease his glories date, and throwne his throne to ground. 39 His daies of youth hast thou made short, cut off before they came: Un-ripened reapt, but to abort, and wrapt him up with shame. Selah. 40 For ever, Lord, and no returne, how long thy selfe absent? How long wilt thou thy wrath shall burne, like fire, and not relent? 41 Remember, O, how swift my time, how short my ages span? In vaine, why all the sons of slime, hast thou created man? 42 What strong man lives, and sees not death, or who his soule shall save; And stop the hand that stops his breath, the hand of Hell, the Grave? Selah. 43 Where, Lord, where are those loves of old, thy former favours borne, So long forborne, so quencht, so cold, thy faith to David sworne? 44 Remember, Lord, thy servants shames, what foule reproach they heare; How many (all great peoples) blames, I in my bosome beare. 45 Wherewith thy foes, Lord, have reproach't, wherewith reproach't they have: Of thine Annointed scandals broach't, the footsteps to deprave. To Age and Age, as heretofore, among the sons of men: Blest be the Lord for evermore, Amen (say we) Amen. Finis Libri tertii. Lib. IIII. Psal. 90. Domine, refugium. Oratio Mosis Viri Dei. 1 Thou, Lord, hast bin our dwelling place, nor other refuge wee; Nor other found our fathers race, from Age to Age but thee. 2 Before the Mountaines borne were nam'd, of mother earth a part: Before the earth or world were fram'd, eternall God thou ART. 3 Man to his mold dissolv'd thou laist in dust of death, and then, To fraile and contrite earth thou saist, Returne ye sons of men. 4 For yeeres a thousand in thine eies, are but as yesterday; When past it is, by night; so flies the wing'd-foot watch a way. 5 Thou bearst them as a floud of sleep, that slides along the sand; As morning deaws on Meddowes weep, that wait the Mowers hand. 6 Whose grasse the rising Sun sees green, and flowring fresh as day; Which downe at evening mowne is seen, a withered locke of hay. 7 For as thine anger waxeth great, so we consume withall; And troubled at thy furies heat, how sudden is our fall? 8 Our faults, that feare or shame would hide, before thee hast thou set; And at thy faces light descri'd, our secret sins are met. 9 For when thy wrath on us is brought, then all our daies decline: Our yeeres consume we as a thought, our blast of breath resigne. 10 Our daies are threescore yeeres and ten, fourscore, if strength supply, Pride reapt with paine, and (wretched men) how soon away we flie? 11 Who knowes what power thine anger hath, who hath the power to beare? Sure, best the fury of thy wrath, is measur'd by thy feare. 12 O teach us then to know our daies, their number so to try, That taught by thee to wisedomes waies, our hearts we may apply. 13 Returne, O Lord, how long? at last, O let it thee repent: Of thy displeasures bitter blast, against thy servants bent. 14 And let thy mercies morning deaw, upon us downe distill; So all our daies of life (a few) shall joy and gladnesse fill. 15 Like joyfull daies, as while by thee afflicted we have been; Good yeeres, like many, let us see, as evill we have seen. 16 And what thy hand for us hath wrought, to us thy servants shew; And what thy glory forth hath brought, make thou our sons to know. 17 And, Lord our God, on us let stand, thy pleasing graciousnesse: To prosper what we take in hand, our handy worke to blesse. Psal. 91. Qui habitat. 1 He that with him, that is Most-Hie, in secret shall abide, Shall to th' Almighties shadow flie, his safe-lodg'd head to hide. 2 With him: “My refuge, thou, my Fort, (say to the Lord will I;) My God, with whom in safeties Port, my hopes at anchor lie. 3 He, where the Fowler sets his snare, shall set thee free from thence; And to preserve thee have a care, from woefull Pestilence. 4 His wing, to over-shade thee spread, his plumes thy confidence: His Truth a shield to save thy head, a buckler for defence. 5 Nor shall thee, terrour of the night, nor arrow shot by day: 6 Nor Plague, that walkes in darkness, smite, nor noon-tide-Keteb slay. 7 A thousand fall beside thee shall, yet thou not fall thereby: Ten thousand at thy right hand fall, yet thee no Plague come nie. 8 This onely shall thine eye behold, what payment for their paine: For what reward their service sold, what hire the wicked gaine. 9 Because thou, Lord (my hope hath said) my hope dost fortifie; The Mansion of my hope is laid in him, that is Most-Hie. 10 There shall no evill thee befall, thy Tent no Plague annoy: 11 Thy keepers, he his Angels shall in all thy waies employ. 12 And they, to beare thee up from ground, shall joyne their palmes in one: Thy foot, lest lightly thou shouldst wound, or dash against a stone. 13 Upon the Lion shalt thou tread, upon the Aspikes crowne: The Lions whelp, the Dragons head, thy foot shall trample downe. 14 Because on me he set his love, whence his deliverance came; Him will I set his harmes above, for he hath knowne my Name. 15 His calling on me will I heare, and answer his entreat: Be with him in distresse, set cleare, and make his honour great. 16 Long life on him will I bestow, and fill him full of daies; And unto him the splendour shew of my salvations rayes. Psal. 92. Bonum est confiteri. Ad diem Sabbathi. 1 To praise the Lord, is to present a good and gracious thing; And, O Most-Hie, a day well spent, Psalmes to thy Name to sing. 2 When for my morning songs delight, I strike thy Mercies string: Still-musicke, when to silent night, thy faithfulnesse I sing. 3 To touch the ten-string'd Lute with art, on Psalterie to sound; The meditation of my heart, to make my Harp expound. 4 For thou, O Lord, hast made me glad, such worke thou bringst about; And such successe thy hands have had, that I for joy will shout. 5 Thine actions are, O Lord, how great? thy thoughts exceeding deep, Whereof the brute hath no conceit, the foolish takes no keep. 6 When, like the grasse, the wicked growes, to evill doers nie: Their endlesse fall, their flowre fore-shewes; thou Lord, for ever hie. 8 For, loe thy foes, Lord, loe thy foes, their ruines time attends; And wicked workers worke the woes, that worke them wofull ends. 9 But like the Unicorne's, my Horne, exalted shall appeare: And with fresh Oyle, mine Age, unworne, annointed, shall I beare; 10 With envious eyes, who me behold, their fall shall feed mine eyes, Mine eyes shall heare their ruine told, that up against me rise. 11 The Just shall like a Palm tree spread, what blast soever blowes, And Cedar-like, lift up his head, in Lebanon that growes. 12 The planted, where the Lord doth dwell, the plants there rooted deep; Within the Courts shall prosper well, where house our God doth keep. 13 Their graynesse fruit yet forth shall bring, no Ages grievance, seene: Their Almond-tree, their Autumne-spring, shall sprout out fat and greene. 14 That they may shew, and men may see, the Lord to be upright; That no unrighteousnesse can be in him, my Rocke of might. Psal. 93. Dominus regnavit. 1 The Lord raignes Soveraigne Governour, is cloth'd with glory bright: The Lord is cloth'd in robes of power, hath girt himselfe with might. The world is also made so sure, to be remov'd by none: 2 From then, establisht to endure, eternall is thy Throne. 3 The flouds up-rais'd, Lord, make a noise, with mouthes, like gaping graves, The flouds have lifted up their voice, the flouds lift up their waves. 4 When many waters voices crie, and winds raise mighty seas, More mighty he that sits on hie, the Lord can them appease. 5 Thy Testimonies are the summes of very faithfull sayes: Thine House, Lord, Holinesse becomes, to endlesse length of daies. Psal. 94. Deus ultionum. 1 Lord God, to whom revenge belongs, set forth thy selfe thereto: O God, avenger of all wrongs, shew what thy power can doe. 2 Judge of the earth, lift up thy head, the proud lift up their hearts; Upon the haughty-hearted tread, reward them their deserts. 3 How long insult, O Lord, how long shall wicked, wicked scorne, Contriving, executing wrong, with such delight be borne? 4 How long shall wicked workers speake the language of disdaine; And forth in such proud boastings breake their mischiefes, bred with paine? 5 Thy people, Lord, they bruise, they bray, thine heritage oppresse: The widow and the stranger slay, strike dead the fatherlesse. 6 God shall not looke (say they) so nie, and who shall make him know? 7 The God of Jacob is too hie, to understand so low. 8 Unwise among the people heed, in time your selves advise, Before too farre your pride proceed: Fooles, when will ye be wise? 9 Shall he, whose hand did plant the eare, of hearing have no sense? Nor sight, the eyes great Enginer, that form'd their sevenfold fense? 10 He that whole Nations doth chastise, his censure who shall beare? He that in knowledge schooles the wise, his compasse who shall steere? 11 The Lord, he knowes mans thoughts (vaine foole) to vaine conclusions draw: 12 Blest (Lord) the man thou sett'st to schoole, and lesson'st in thy Law. 13 To give him, from the evill daies, in quiet rest to sit: From them that follow wicked waies, untill be digg'd the pit. 14 His people want the Lord may make, yet will not leave them there; Nor his Inheritance forsake, howbeit, sometime forbeare. 15 But Judgement shall to Justice fall, to Righteousnesse revert; And after it shall follow all that are upright in heart. 16 Against the evill doers head, with me who lifts a hand? Against iniquitie to plead, on my part who will stand? 17 If from the Lord, that never failes, some help I had not felt, My soule had then (that now prevailes) almost in silence dwelt. 18 When, Lord, I said my foot did move, thy mercy was my stay; My soules delights (thy comforts) drove my clouds of thoughts away. 19 Of Tyran-evills shall the throne have fellowship with thee; Whose shadow'd lusts, for law have gone, of mischiefe make decree? 20 The Just mans soule they hunt by troupes, condemne the guiltlesse blood: 21 My refuge yet, the Lord, my hopes, my God their Rocke, makes good. 22 On them the Lord shall cause to fall their painfull wickednesse: Suppresse them in their malice shall, our God shall them suppresse. Psal. 95. Venite, exultemus. 1 Come to the Lord, sing joyfully, let us together flocke; And shout aloud triumphantly, in our Salvations Rocke. 2 His face with praise let us prevent, in him with Psalmes rejoyce: Triumphant shouts to him present, and make a cheerfull noise. 3 For why? the Lord our God is great, a mighty King he is: Above all gods, the Soveraigne seat, the power Imperiall his. 4 The deeps of earth are in his hand, his, is the strength of Hills: The shore-bound sea, the dry-laid land, his hand that form'd, fulfills. 5 O come, and let us then adore, due worship yeeld him all; And prostrate on our knees, before the Lord our Maker fall. 6 For in his folds and fields is he our God, that doth us keep: The pasture his, his people we, we of his hand the sheep. 7 To day his voice if ye will heare, then harden not your hearts: In Meribah, like them that were, in Massah's Desert parts. 8 That day your fathers faulty were, shooke off their former awe: 9 To tempt Me fell, to prove Me there, and yet my workes they saw. 10 To whom (said I) with griefe deferr'd, full forty yeeres of daies, This people in their heart have err'd, and have not knowne my waies. 11 To whom I swore it in my wrath, hot boiling in my brest: If ever—: witnesse this mine oath, they enter not my rest. Psal. 96. Cantate Domino. 1 Sing to the Lord a new set song, that all the earth may sing; That all, that to the Lord belong, his praise aloud may ring. 2 Sing to the Lord, and blesse his Name, where-ever day doth dwell; Good tidings day by day proclaime, of his salvation tell. 3 Among the Heath'ns his glory shew, to Nations farre and neere; His wonders let the people know, with wondrous gladnesse heare. 4 For great the Lord, his greatnesse more, than can by praise be prais'd: All other gods above, before, his feare is to be rais'd. 5 For all the gods among the Heath'ns, are off-gods, Idols vaine: The Lord is he that made the Heav'ns, of Heav'ns, that holds the reine. 6 Before him beames of glory bright, and Majestie bowe downe: His Sanctuary, matchlesse might, and beauteous glory crowne. 7 Ascribe unto the Lord, ascribe of every line that live; Of all the people, every tribe, all power and glory give. 8 Give to the Lord the honour'd Name, that with his glory sorts: Take up an offring to the same, and come into his Courts. 9 In honour of his Holy place, before the Lord appeare: Bowe downe your selves, and at his face stand all the earth in feare. 10 The Lord (so tell the Nations) raignes, establisht by his might: That he, the world unmov'd containes, shall judge the people right. 11 Let Heav'ns (the havens of joy) rejoyce, and let the earth be glad; The sea set forth his roaring voice, in all his plenty clad. 12 Field, and what ever clothes the field, shout out in speechlesse noise; All trees, that Frith or Forrest yeeld, before the Lord rejoyce. 13 Because he comes, because he comes, with Judgement in his mouth, To judge the world with righteous doomes, earths people with his Truth. Psal. 97. Dominus regnavit. 1 Rejoyce let earths whole Continent, it is the Lord that raignes: Be glad, ye many Islands, pent within the Maines demaines. 2 About him clouds and darknesse round, obscur'd the light that shone: With Justice, Judgement laid the ground, the Bases of his Throne. 3 Consuming fire before him goes, that flaming from on hie, On every side pursues his foes, them following where they flie. 4 His lightnings at the world shoot light, which bright, but dreadfull shines; The earth lies trembling at the sight, and from her hinge declines. 5 In presence when the Lord appear'd, like waxe, the Mountaines melt: The Lord of all the earth they fear'd, his presence (trembling) felt. 6 His Justice, as the Heavens declare, whose Ministers they be; On earth how great his glories are, so all the people see. 7 Graven Images all they that serve, confusion stands before; That boast of Idols, whom they carve, him, all ye gods, adore. 8 This Sion heard, and joy'd to heare, that such successe they had; Thy Judgements, Lord, with reverend feare, made Judah's daughters glad. 9 For thou, O Lord, far higher art, than all the earth is hie; No height, to thy heights lowest part, of all the gods comes nie. 10 Hate evill, ye that love the Lord, who for his Saints doth stand; His servants favour'd-soules restor'd, to free from wicked hand. 11 A light is for the Just one sowne, whose crop shall come to light: From whence shall sheaves of joy be mow'n, by men in heart upright. 12 Ye Just then in the Lord rejoyce, your musicke make his praise: His Holinesse, with thankfull voice, remembring to up-raise. Psal. 98. Cantate Domino. 1 Sing to the Lord a new-set song, for wonders hath he done: With holy Arme, whose right hand strong, hath his Salvation wonne. 2 His saving health the Lord made knowne, the Nations eyes beheld: His Justice to the people shewne, hath he himselfe reveal'd. 3 His Truth and Mercy, mindfull friends to Israels house have been; And of the earth, have all the ends, our Gods Salvation seen. 4 Shout to the Lord a cheerfull cry, let all the earth up-raise: Shout out, rejoyce triumphantly, in joyfull Psalmes sing praise. 5 Sing Psalmes with Harp, with Harp &amp; Voice, Psalmes to th' Eternall sing: 6 With Trumpets sound, with Cornets noise, before the Lord the King. 7 Roare sea, and all that sea full fills, world, and world-dwellers all: 8 High-rising rivers, high-borne Hills, clap hands, to shouting fall 9 Before the Lord: for he in sight, to judge the earth is come: To give the world his judgements right, the peoples equall doome. Psal. 99. Dominus regnavit. 1 The Lord is King, though peoples fits, his raigne (in rage) reprove: Between the Cherubims he sits, let earths foundations move. 2 The Lord is great in Zions fame, above all people hie: 3 Great, fearfull, holy is his Name, let their confession crie. 4 Strength-strengthning Judgement loves the King, of Righteousnesse his Throne: With Justice Judgement stablishing, in Jacob hast thou done. 5 The Lord our God, as it is meet, exalt, and prostrate all; Before the footstoole of his feet, (for he is Holy) fall. 6 With Moses, Aarons Priests enstall'd, and Samuel, on his Name, With them that call, on JAH they call'd, the Lord then answer'd them. 7 He from the cloudy Pillar spoke, they in obedience have His Testimonies kept unbroke, the Law to them he gave. 8 Thou Lord our God didst answer make, their pardoning-God thou wert; Yet did thy vengeance overtake, and their inventions thwart. 9 Exalt the Lord our God, before his holy Mountaine all; (For Holy is our God) therefore bowe downe your selves, and fall. Psal. 100. Jubilate Deo. Psalmus, ad Confessionem. 1 Sing loud unto the Lord a song, that all the earth may ring: 2 With gladnesse serve the Lord among, before him come and sing. 3 Know that the Lord is God, that he, not we our selves did make: His pasture-sheep, his people, we from him our being take. 4 Goe in his gates, your thankes proclaime, his praise within his Courts: To praise him, and to blesse his Name, make thither your resorts. 5 For good and gracious is the Lord, his Mercy never ends: The truth of his eternall Word, to Age and Age extends. Psal. 101. Misericordiam &amp; Judicium. Davidis Psalmus. 1 What Mercy, and what Judgement say, Lord, I will sing to thee: 2 And wisely take the perfect way, when thou shalt come to mee. 3 My selfe will good example give, to walke with upright heart; And others, as I live, to live, amidst my house convert. 3 I will not in mine eyes, abide a word of Belial: I hate their worke, that turne aside, nor cleave to me it shall: 4 A froward heart, an evill man, from me unknowne depart: 5 Detractors tongue, nor beare I can, proud looke, nor large of heart. 6 The faithfull of the Land mine eyes sort out with me to sit; In perfect way, whose walking lies, for me is servant fit. 7 Within mine house deceitfull wight there shall not any dwell; Nor be establisht in my sight, whose lips doth leasings tell. 8 The wicked all out of the land, my morning search shall shut, That from Gods City may my hand all evill doers cut. Psal. 102. Domine, exaudi. Oratio afflicti, cùm obruitur, &amp; effundit coram Domino meditationem suam. 1 In my distresse to comfort me, yet heare, O Lord, my praier; And let the crying unto thee of my complaint repaire. 2 Hide not thy face from me this day, when trouble tells my need: Incline thine eare, and heare me pray, to answer me make speed. 3 For here my daies consum'd on earth, away like smoake are gone: My bones are burnt up, like an hearth of fire-out-eaten stone. 4 My heart is smitten downe for dead, and withred as the grasse; That I, to eate my daily bread, forgetfull, overpasse. 5 My breast, my sorrowes uncouth Inne, breathes forth such broken groanes, My flesh but knits up with my skinne, a sacke of saplesse bones. 6 So mournes the Wildernesses Foule, the Hermit-Pellican: In Desert shades so shriekes the Owle, portending spells of bane. 7 I watch the widow'd Sparrowes watch, on houses ridge alone, That of (her better halfe) her match, bewailes the comfort gone. 8 Reproaches bitter gall, my foes cast daily in my dish; And in their madnesse make my woes, the measure of their wish. 9 For I, when faintnesse would be fed, and thirst no longer beares, Have eaten ashes as my bread, and blent my drinkes with teares. 10 Thine angry threat so sore doth lie, so fierce thy wrath doth grow; Thy hand but heav'd me up so hie to hurle me downe as low. 11 The shadow of my daies declin'd, my light in darknesse spends; Like withred grasse my breath resign'd, the house of death attends. 12 But thou, O Lord, one and the same, for ever dost reside; And this Memoriall of thy Name, shall age and age abide. 13 Thou to thy mercies seat shalt climbe, and bring thy Sion home: For now of mercy is the time, (the time appointed) come. 14 Now, though thy servants nought relieve, delight her stones yet move: To see her in the dust they grieve, and yet her dust they love. 15 Thy Name, O Lord, the Heath'ns shall feare, to find what thou hast done; And all the Kings on earth, to heare what glory thou hast wonne. 16 When Sion up the Lord to build, in glory shall appeare: 17 He to the lowlies praier shall yeeld, nor them despise to heare. 18 This writing shall remaine un-worne, when after-age shall live; And praise, the people yet un-borne, unto the Lord shall give. 19 For from his Sanctuaries height, he downe did cast his looke: The Lord from Heaven did vaile his sight, when earths survey he tooke. 20 To heare the heavie groanes of those, that draw imprison'd breath; From chimes of iron chaines to loose the eldest sonnes of death. 21 That of the Lord their tongues the Name in Sion may declare; And in Jerusalem proclaime his praises what they are. 22 When Nations, from their farthest home, together gathred meet: To serve the Lord, when Soveraignes come, and Kingdomes kisse his feet. 23 My strength, when able strength began, he weakned in my waies: Cut off my pilgrimages span, and shorter made my daies. 24 I said, my God, post not my Sunne at noone to mid-nights stage; My race of daies is halfe to runne, thy yeeres are Age and Age. 25 The earths foundations, on their weight, thou Lord hast laid of old: Those lamps of Heaven, their orbes, their height, thy fingers did enfold. 26 When they shall perish, thou shalt hold the Centre of thy yeeres: They, as a garment, all waxe old, as chang'd, a vesture weares. 27 But thee, for evermore the same, no compasse comprehends; And of thy yeeres eternall frame, the circle never ends. 28 Thy servants children shall succeed, to stand before thee fast; And last-succeeding times, their seed succeeding, shall out-last. Psal. 103. Benedic anima. Davidis. 1 My soule, and every secret part, within my bodies frame, To praise the Lord assist my heart, to blesse his holy Name. 2 To blesse the Lord, let nothing let my soule thy ready way: No benefit of his forget, with praises to repay. 3 Which pardoning all thy sins fore-past, wish thee in mercy deales; To cure thy frailties doth fore-cast, and all thy sicknesse heales. 4 Which frees thy life from going downe into corruptions Pit; His Mercies and Compassions Crowne upon thine head doth fit. 5 With good things, to thy hearts desire, which satiates thy mouth; And, Eagle-like, renewes the fire, in embers of thy youth. 6 To Justices the Lord gives light, he guides the ballance best; And Judgements executes aright, to all that are opprest. 7 His waies he made to Moses knowne, the limits of his Law: His wondrous actions, all his owne, the sons of Israel saw. 8 Compassion from the Lord doth flow, for clemencie none such; Of suffrance long, to anger slow, his tender mercy much. 9 His censure checkes not each offence, he will not alwaies chide; Nor keep his anger in suspense, for ever to abide. 10 He hath not, as our sins require, with us severely dealt; Nor our iniquities like hire, to our deserts have felt. 11 But, as the Heavens unmeasur'd height, above the earth is hie; Such is his Mercies matchlesse might, to them that feare him, nie. 12 As far as where the Sunne begins, to where he sets the day; So farre hath he remov'd our sins, and rid his wrath away. 13 As with compassion on his sons, a fathers bowells melt; So in the Lord compassion runs, by them that feare him, felt. 14 For to the mold he knowes we must, whereof our masse was made: Remembers that we be but dust, our Harbinger, the spade. 15 The daies of man, as of the grasse, attend the sithe of death: As flower in field, his flower doth passe, and withreth with a breath. 16 A blast of wind upon it blew, and then it ceast to grow; Then ceast to be, and where it grew, the place no more did know. 17 To them the Lord is ever kind, that to his feare doe cleave: Them shall the childrens children find, his Justice shall not leave. 18 On them, that to his Covenant bind their hearts observance strait; And his Commandments beare in mind to practise, Mercies wait. 19 The Lord hath firmly for his stall in Heav'ns prepar'd his Throne: His Kingdomes Scepter over all hath Soveraigntie alone. 20 O ye his Angels, blesse the Lord, ye that in strength excell; That doe his Word, and of his Word attend the voices spell. 21 Blesse ye the Lord, all ye his Hosts, his Armies at his will; His Cursitors in all his coasts, his pleasure to fulfill. 22 All ye his workes, that where he reignes, all places may afford: To blesse the Lord employ your paines, my soule, blesse thou the Lord. Psal. 104. Benedic anima. 1 Sing to the Lord, my soule, sing praise; Thou Lord my God art wondrous great, Whose vestures golden-circled raies, With beauteous glory crowne thy seat. 2 Which deck'st thy selfe, as with a robe, With light, that never eye attain'd; Which for thy vaile about earths globe, The Canopie of Heaven hast strain'd. 3 His roofes with starre-set seas he seeles, Their beames in plates of waters binds, Ascends the clouds, his chariot wheeles, And walkes upon the long-wing'd winds. 4 He makes his Angels messengers, And with his Spirit their spirits inspires; Sends forth his Judgements ministers, The lightning-sooted flames of fires. 5 The earth upon her Bases laid, To one so equall point he drove, To one so stedfast Center weigh'd, As never weight her weight might move. 6 As with a garment, with the deep, Thou coveredst earth: the Maine stop'd-flat, Maine sea above the Mountaines steep, Above the Mount of Ararat. 7 At thy rebuke the waters fled, Thy thunders voice them rid away. 8 The Hills un-heald, held up their head, The Vallies, where thou laidst them, lay. 9 The Waters bound didst thou ordaine, Bound, which they should not dare to passe, Nor ever more returne againe, To drowne the earth, as once it was. 10 He into Vallies sends his springs, To dye their dusty mantles green; From Rock-rent heads their current brings, To walke the Mountaine veines between. 11 Whose channels having cheer'd the field, And to the earth given moisture first, To all the wild Beasts beaverage yeeld, There breake the Onagers their thirst. 12 The Foules of heaven their housholds bring, And there in notes of Natures choice, Their Makers Halelu-jahs sing; Between the branches give the voice. 13 Upon the Mountaines garden-land, His deawes are from his Limbecks still'd: With store, without mans helping hand, (Fruit of thy workes) the earth is fill'd. 14 For cattell makes he grasse to grow, And herbe for use of earthly man, Whose simples, who so wise, that know As well for meat, as medicine can. 15 The earth to bring forth bread and wine, The wine, with joy that swells the veines, With oile, that makes mans face to shine, And bread, that strength of heart sustaines. 16 The trees of God are fill'd with sap, The Cedar trees of Lebanon, Which he hath planted on the lap Of earth, for them to feed upon. 17 That there their nests the Birds may build, The kind-love Storke, in Pine-tree grove, 18 High Mountaine cliffes the Roe-deere wild, Safe-sheltring Rockes the Conies love. 19 The Moon he made for certain tides, Constant in her inconstant face: The Sun, that daily progresse rides, Of his dismounting knowes the place. 20 Thou puttest darknesse, darknesse, night; Then all the woods wild Beasts forth creep, By prey that live, and love not light, (Then harmfull wake, when harmlesse sleep.) 21 Fierce Lions roaring for their prey, Their food of life from God request: 22 The Sun gets up, they get away, And in their dens couch downe to rest: 23 Then out goes man, to take in hand His worke, till night his travell end, With toiling Beast from labour'd land, Till evening home him weary send. 24 Thy workes, O Lord, how many are, In wisedome hast thou made them all, The earths abundance is thy care, Whose riches thee Creatour call. 25 This sea, so great wide-handed deep, Thou foundedst, fathom'st, fillst the seat, Where kinds innumerable creep, Lords of the finne, both small and great. 26 There ships their course by compasse can, And cut the Maine, to make their way: There walkes the vast Leviathan, Whom thou therein hast form'd for play. 27 These all on thee attentive looke, That thou in season give them food; 28 Thou giv'st, they take, and having tooke, From thy free hand are fill'd with good. 29 Thou hid'st from them thy faces day, They at so sudden trouble mourne; Their spirit thou tak'st (their breath) away, They to their dust againe returne. 30 Againe, thou sendest forth thy Spirit, Whence they created, take their birth, Which (by traduction) they inherit. As thou renew'st the face of earth. 31 The glory of the Lord shall shine For ever in eternall light: Which length of time shall not confine, The Lord shall in his workes delight. 32 The earth stands trembling at his looke, Unable to endure his sight: Let him but touch, the Mountaines smoake, And clothe the earth in clouds of night. 33 Sing to the Lord will I so long, As life in mee leaves any breath: Sung to the Lord shall be my song, Untill my being be in death. 34 My Muse on him shall sweetly call, And in the Lord rejoyce with me: 35 Consum'd from earth let sinners fall, And wicked men no more let be. Psal. 105. Confitemini Domino. 1 Confessing to the Lord, give thankes, and call upon his Name: Make knowne among the peoples rankes, his powerfull acts proclaime. 2 Sing ye to him, to him sing praise, a Psalme that shall excell: His praise-excelling workes up-raise, of all his wonders tell. 3 His holy Name your glory make, and let their heart rejoyce, That for the Lord all joy forsake, to seeke him set their choice. 4 O seeke the Lord with zealous mind, his Oracle of grace; His Arke of strength enquire to find, seeke evermore his face. 5 His marvels done, his wonders heed, his mouths expressions: 6 O ye his servant Abrams seed, his chosen Jacobs sons. 7 He is the Lord our God, whose care in us hath speciall right: In all the earth his Judgements are, in every Nations sight. 8 His Covenant he doth ever mind, his words command fore-past; That childrens childrens seed should find a thousand ages last. 9 This Covenant he with Abram strooke, to Isaac swore to pay: 10 To Jacob for a Law betooke, to Israel for aye. 11 Thine off-spring (saying) to advance I Cana'n land will give, The line of thine Inheritance, wherein thy seed shall live. 12 When few of number, meanes bereft, they strangers in the land: 13 One Nation for another left, as Kingdomes came to band. 14 To doe them wrong, he suffred none, even Kings for them he charm'd: 15 “Of mine Annointed touch not one, nor see my Prophets harm'd. 16 He call'd a famine on the Land, so long with plenty fed: To weaken their ingratefull hand, brake all the staffe of bread. 17 Before them, for the dearth fore-told, he sent a man at last; Young Joseph, for a servant sold, and into prison cast. 18 His feet in fetters fast they pent, where wrung, and wrested long, His soule, into the iron went, into his soule, the wrong. 19 Untill his cause for sentence cri'd, his innocence to scan: Untill by word the Lord had tri'd, what worth was in the man. 20 The King would his discharger be, for his deliverance sent: The peoples Ruler set him free from fault, from punishment. 21 Lord of his house he him assign'd, his substance to assise: 22 His Princes to his soule to bind, and make his Elders wise. 23 So Israel into Egypt came, from Cana'ns better clime; And Jacob in the land of Cham, did sojourne for a time. 24 His people mightily encrease, then their oppressors made A Nation more secure for peace, and stronger to invade. 25 Yet Egypts heart averse was felt, his people they did hate; And doubly with his servants dealt, unjustly held debate. 26 His servant Moses then he sent, and Aarons chosen head: 27 Words of his signes among them spent, in Cham his wonders spread. 28 His Word in darknesse cloth'd the light, three daies continued they In darknesse, darker than the night, and did not disobey. 28 He turn'd their waters into bloud, their fish flung dead on shore; Chang'd Nilus to a noisome flood, her silver streames to gore. 30 Their land in legions brought forth frogs, in field, in house, in hall: In Kings bed-chambers, as in bogs, the loathsome Paddockes crawle. 31 He spake the word, and in a trice, a cloud of Vermine arm'd, Wing'd-Flies, and Infantries of Lice, in all their quarters swarm'd. 32 For showers of raine from gentler hand, he flung them stones of haile; And flames of fire, that made their land, of flocke and fruit to faile. 33 With storme their Vine, their Fig-tree strook, most fruitfull, most of all; Of Trees throughout their border broke the highest, soonest fall. 34 Of Grashoppers a mighty presse, his word inspir'd with pow'r; And Caterpiller numberlesse, 35 All herbes and fruit devoure. 36 In Egypt all their eldest borne, with hand of death he smote; The prime of all their fleece was shorne, their strongest men of note. 37 He brought them forth (these wonders done) with silver and with gold: Among their Tribes there was not one, a feeble person told. 38 At their departure Egypt glad, was of their stay affraid: So lately to forsake them, sad, now loth to see them stai'd. 39 A covering of a cloud he spread, to shade the heat of day: Of fire by night, a lamp to lead, and light them on their way. 40 Of Quaile, he brought at their request a showre, that downe did raine; And with the bread of Heaven them blest, suffic'd with Angels graine. 41 The Rocke of stone made open flie, with waters stor'd the land, That rivers ran in places drie, where late lay Desert sand. 42 His holy promise held so fast, from time it first began; To Abraham his servant past, in his remembrance ran. 43 With joy his people forth he brought, his chosen with a shout: 44 And gave them lands, and labours wrought of Heath'ns, for them cast out: 45 Observe his Statutes, that they might, and of his holy Word The Lawes obey, and learne aright to practise: Praise the Lord. Halelu-jah. Psal. 106. Confitemini. Halelu-jah. 1 The Lord is good, with thankes confesse, his Mercy hath no end: 2 The Lords great powers who can expresse? who all his praise commend? 3 What blessings kept for them remaine, that Judgements keepers are! For him, that Justice to maintaine, at all times sets his care! 4 Remember, Lord, I numbred be with them thou tak'st to grace: With thy Salvation visit me, with thy choice people place. 5 To see what blessings by thy choice, thy chosen flocke have got: And with thy Nations joy rejoyce, and glory in their lot. 6 We, with our fathers sinfully transgrest have every one; Committed like iniquitie, as wickedly have done. 7 Thy wonder-passing wonders past, which Egypts plagues could find, Our fathers did not wisely cast, nor compasse in their mind. Thy many Mercies held no plea, from their remembrance fell; But they (revolters) at the sea, (the red sea) did rebell. 8 Yet for his Names sake, not the lesse, was he their Saviour: His Mercy, as they must confesse, to make them know his power. 9 The red seas course he backe did keep, and with rebuke represse: He led them dry-foot through the deep, as through the wildernesse. 10 And so he set them all on land, in safety from the foe; And from their haters harmfull hand redeem'd, and let them goe. 11 Their troublers, by the waters fall, were all of life bereft; The waters overwhelm'd them all, not one of them was left. 12 With them his words then credit got, they sung his praise to height: 13 But all in haste his workes forgot, his counsells would not wait. 14 So in the wildernesse, at last, upon them came their lust; And in the Desert, Gods fore-cast they tempted with distrust. 15 And food he gave them at their call, above their lusts content: But loathing leannesse therewithall into their soule he sent. 15 They weari'd Moses with complaint, in their envious mood; And Aaron, of the Lord, the Saint, within the Camp withstood. 17 The mother-earth that Rebells hates, an open grave did rive; Where Dathan and Abirams Mates were swallowed up alive. 18 And fire from Heaven that kindled came on their rebellious crew; Burnt up the wicked in the flame, their furious treasons due. 19 They made a Calfe in Choreb Mount, ador'd a molten Masse: 20 Their glories type, to base account, turn'd Oxe, that eateth grasse. 21 And God their Saviour they forgate, his Armes remembrance gone, That had so mighty things of late for them in Egypt done. 22 Workes wondrous, for a world of graves, in Chams un-peopled coast; And fearfull, for the red sea waves, that sav'd, that drown'd, an host. 23 And to destroy them in his mood, flew out his wrathfull speech, Had not his chosen Moses stood before him in the breach. 24 His milder temper, mixt with zeale, Gods wrath, so hot that burn'd; With hard entreaty did congeale, and from corrupting turn'd. 25 They of desire despis'd the land, beleeving not his word; But in their tents in tumult stand, and will not heare the Lord. 26 Against them therefore urg'd, aloft he lifted up his hand, To overthrow them threatned oft, in that forsaken land. 27 Among the Nations, not their owne, to fell their rootlesse seed; And in the lands, to them unknowne, to fanne their exil'd breed. 28 And to Baal Phegors Idoll-head, they joyn'd themselves amaine, The offrings eating of the dead, to powers Infernall slaine. 29 Thus they to anger him provoke, with Rites that they invent; And in the plague upon them broke, their follies punishment. 30 Then stood up Phineas in pursuit of Cosbies carnall sin; His hand did Judgement execute, so was the plague call'd in. 31 The Author of so just a deed, his Justice did commend: From age to age that shall succeed, whose praise shall never end. 32 They vext him at the flouds of strife, with Moses ill it went: For them he had a weary life, and for their sakes was shent. 33 Because his spirit they did provoke, and him to murmure prest; That unadvisedly he spoke, and with his lips transgrest. 34 The Nations did they not destroy, of whom the Lord had said, Nor land, nor life let them enjoy, his charge they disobey'd. 35 But mingled with the Heath'ns they were, to learne their workes tooke care: 36 To serve their Idolls well could beare, which were to them a snare. 37 The bloud of sons and daughters slaine, on Divels Altars stood: Of Innocents the bloudy staine of sons and daughters bloud. Whose limbes their Divellish-led desire with murthrous hand had pil'd; To Cana'n-Idolls burnt with fire, the Land with bloud defil'd. 38 With works their own thus were they stain'd, on them their zeale they spent: 39 As their Inventions entertain'd, a whoring thus they went. 40 The fury therefore of the Lord against his people burn'd: His owne Inheritance abhorr'd, his love to loathing turn'd. 41 He gave them up to Tyran's law, into the Heathens hand; That whom they hated held in awe, and Lord-like might command. 42 By enemies, with humbling strokes, opprest and bow'd they were: Whose hand on them laid heavie yokes, above their strength to beare. 43 Them many a time did he redeem, but they eftsoon begin; And of their counsells more esteem, though humbled for their sin. 44 Yet when he saw their hard restraint, how their afflictions grew; Then hearkning he to their complaint, his chastisement withdrew. 45 His Covenant did he beare in mind, that he with them had strooke; On them his many mercies kind, repentant pity tooke. 46 He gave them to the tender eare of their Commanders will: Made them, to whom they captives were, their eyes with favours fill. 47 Proceed, O Lord our God, to save, from Heath'ns our heads to raise, That praise thy holy Name may have, we glory in thy praise. 48 The Lord the God, of Israel King, be blest eternally: Amen, let all the people sing, all Halelu-jah cry. Finis Libri quarti. Lib. V. Psal. 107. Confitemini Domino. 1 The Lord is God, with thanks expresse, His mercy is for ever: and 2 So let the Lords redeem'd confesse, Redeem'd from their distressors hand. 3 Which gathred were out of the lands, From shining East, from shady West, From where the frozen Pole-starre stands, From Desert south-seas sun-burnt breft. 4 They wandred in the Wildernesse, And tooke a solitary way, Where foot of man did seldome presse, Nor found they City where to stay. 5 With hunger pin'd, with thirsting faint, Their anguish't soule was overcharg'd. 6 Then to the Lord they made complaint, Who them from their distresse enlarg'd. 7 He led them on, and brought them home, The readiest way, for them the best; That to a City they might come, An habitation where to rest. 8 Let them before the Lord confesse His tender mercies many a one, To men his wondrous workes expresse, That he for Adams sons hath done. 9 The thirsty soule he satiates, The hungry soule with good sustaines, 10 That sits in darknesse, at the gates, And shade of death in iron chaines. 11 Because, against the words of God, They bent themselves rebelliously, Despis'd his counsell, and withstood The hand of him that is Most-Hie. 12 Thus humbled, for they did not well, In griefe of heart he let them lie, Where downe they fell, but helplesse fell, For refuge none, nor help was nie. 13 Distrest, unto the Lord they cri'd, Who set them free from their distresse: 14 From darknesse, from deaths shade unti'd, And brake their bands of heavinesse. 15 Let them before the Lord confesse His tender-mercies many a one, To men his wondrous workes expresse, That he for Adams sons hath done. 16 For he the gates of brasse hath broke, The gates of brasse against him bent; And by his hands resistlesse stroke, The iron barres in sunder rent. 17 Fooles for their faults afflicted are, Whose way hath made their will their law: 18 Their soule abhorres all kind of fare, Neere to the gates of death they draw. 19 Distrest, unto the Lord they cry, Who them from dying anguish saves: 20 He heales them by his words supply, And frees them from corrupting graves. 21 Let them before the Lord confesse His tender mercies many a one, To men his wondrous workes expresse, Which he for Adams sons hath done. 22 Before him offrings let them lay, Confessions of their thankfulnesse, And sacrifice of praises pay, His workes with shouts of joy expresse. 23 They that in ships goe downe to sea, And Marts in many waters keep: 24 What deeds the Lord hath showne them, see His workes of wonder in the deep. 25 The stormy wind his word bespake, That all the Maine with Mountaines fills: The sea-wet starres their mantles shake, The brinie downes are turn'd to hills. 26 As high as Heaven the billowes mount, Dis-mounted, deep as hell descend: Their melting soule makes small account, But feare of death, in death to end. 27 Thus bandi'd to and fro they reele, And stagger like a drunken man: Ill may the Pilot rule the keele, Where wisedomes care so little can. 28 Distrest, unto the Lord they crie, Who sets them free from their distresse: 29 The storme he calmes with cleerer skie, And sets their waves at quietnesse. 30 The combat ceast, the sea-men glad, That winds and waves were parted friends, He that of them the conduct had, To their desired haven them sends. 31 Let them before the Lord confesse His tender mercies many a one, To men his wondrous workes expresse, That he for Adams sons hath done. 32 Assembled in the peoples throngs, His worthy acts when they repeat, With hymnes of praise, and thankfull songs, Exalt him in the Elders seat. 33 Which turnes the flouds to desert sands. To drinesse drawes the springing Well: 34 With salt he sowes the fruitfull lands, For their misdeeds that therein dwell. 35 Againe, he turnes the desert dry, To standing pooles with water fill'd: 36 And seats the hungry downe thereby, Where they to dwell a City build. 37 Their fields they sow, their vines they plant, Which yeeld them fruits of faire encrease. 38 Their Mynes of wealth no blessings want, Nor suffreth he their heards decrease. 39 On them made lesse, and low brought downe, He makes restraint, and anguish prey: 40 On Princes leaves contempt to frowne, In Deserts lets them lose their way. 41 Yet raiseth he the poore mans head, And makes him peopled housholds keep, From selfe-waste want, with plenty fed, For number like a flocke of sheep. 42 Right-sighted eyes shall see this day, The joy of all the righteous name, And all iniquitie shall lay Her hand upon her mouth for shame. 43 Who so is wise, will take in hand These observations to record: And they shall truly understand The tender mercies of the Lord. Psal. 108. Paratum cor. Canticum Psalmi David. 1 My heart, O God, is ready prest, the glory of my tongue:— My voice, the organ of my brest, Thy praise shall be my song. 2 My Lute and Harpe already strung, my readier hand up take; Before the dawning day have sprung, I early will awake. 3 My thankes to thee, O Lord, will I among the people bring; And of thy praise in harmonie, with Quires of Nations sing. 4 For why? the Heavens are not so hie, as is thy Mercy great: Thy Truth a higher pitch doth flie, than in the clouds to seat. 5 Thy selfe, O God, in highest place, above the Heav'ns enshrine; And let the glory of thy face, on earth, thy foot-stoole, shine. 6 That free deliverance they may have, that are belov'd of thee: With thy right hands assistance save, O heare, and answer mee. 7 God in his Holinesse hath spoke, which I with joy repeat, “In Shechem will I strike a stroke, and Succoths Valley mete. 8 Mine Gilead is, Manasseh mine, strength of my head doth live, In quiver-bearing Ephrams line; my Law shall Judah give. 9 My wash-pot Moab will I make, my shooe on Edom cast: In triumph, thee Pelesheth, take, triumph't on mine that hast. 10 The City for defence so strong, what guide will guide me to? To Edoms warlike Towers along, what leader with mee goe? 11 Not thou, O God, as naught of worth, that hast us cast away: Nor with our hosts, O God, wentst forth, upon the Battells day. 12 O give us help from our distresse, mans health is vaine deceit: Through God we shall doe valiantnesse, our foes he shall defeat. Psal. 109. Deus laudem. Ad Præstantem, Psalmus Davidis. 1 Cease not as deafe, God of my praise, for wicked mouths consent: 2 Deceitfull mouthes their engines raise, against me open bent. 3 With falshoods tongue to me they speake, and compasse me with hate: In bitter language forth they breake, and (causlesse) wage debate. 4 They for my friendship were my foes, with whom by praier I strove: For good against me evill goes, and hatred for my love. 5 His Ruler, some ungodly wretch, set thou at his right hand: 6 Let Satan all advantage catch, his adversary stand. 7 In Judgement let him not evade, but goe condemn'd therein; And let his praier for favour made, be turn'd to further sin. 8 His daies a few and evill make, determin'd in disgrace: His office let another take, a worthier hold his place. 9 His sons let fatherlesse be left, his wife a widow poore: 10 His children of abode bereft, begge bread from doore to doore. 11 Extortion tangle all his toile, the Creditor ensnare: His labour let the stranger spoile, for lone, the lender share. 12 To pity him let there be none, none mercy on him shew: His children fatherlesse, not one with kind compassion know. 13 Of his posterity destroi'd, let naught remaine but shame; And let the following age make void, and cleane put out his name. 14 Remembrance of his fathers crime, the Lord before him lay: His mothers sin at any time, let not be wip't away. 15 Before the Lord continually, in presence let them stand; On earth let their memoriall dye, cut off by Gods owne hand. 16 For mercy was not in his mind, the poore he made his prey; The needy soule he sought to grind, the wounded heart to slay. 17 He loved cursing, let it light, and him from blessing barre; As blessing was not his delight, be blessing from him farre. 18 Of cursing, as his clothes were made, so cursing be his spoile; His bowels and his bones invade, like water, and like oile. 19 About him folded let it fall, him as a cloake enclose; Or as the girdle, wherewithall he alwaies girded goes. 20 This be mine adversaries pay, this from the Lord the stroke, On them that evill any way against my soule have spoke. 21 As thou, Lord God, for me hast stood, so for thy Names sake stand; And for thy Mercy, ever good, release me out of hand. 22 For poore afflicted I complaine, where no reliefe is found; And stripes of sorrowes silent paine, my soule within me wound. 23 As shade, at setting Sun declin'd, so I from life am gone; And as the Locust, with the wind change place, but paine change none. 24 Through fasting feeble are my knees, as leane as living ghost: For cold my cramp-shrunk sinewes freeze, my flesh hath fatnesse lost. 25 Reproaches foot upon me treads, and blots my brow with shame; While they that see me, shake their heads, and make my griefe their game. 26 Help, Lord my God, of thee I crave, that helper else have none: According to thy mercy save thy poore-forsaken one. 27 And let them know, that this thy Arme, that this thy hand alone, Could help me more than they could harme, that this, thou Lord, hast done. 28 And let them curse, but doe thou blesse; them rise, but rise to fall; And that their fall their shame expresse, rejoyce thy servant shall. 29 Shame let mine adversaries beare, such clothing as they spin; And as a cloake, confusion weare, the winding-sheet of sin. 30 But to the Lord my mouth shall sing, and greatly render thankes: Shall make his highest praises ring, in midst of many rankes. 31 Who at the poores right hand will stand, and there his name enroule; With his redeem'd, out of the hand of them that judge his soule. Psal. 110. Dixit Dominus. Psalmus Davidis. 1 Thus to my Lord the Lord did say, Thy seat upon my right hand take, Untill thine eyes behold the day, That I thy foes thy foot-stoole make. 2 The Lord shall out of Sion send The Rod, that shall thy strength maintaine, The Scepter to thy hand commend, Where thou amidst thy foes shalt raigne. 3 Thy voluntary people glad, That to thy power all power shall stoop, That day in holy beauties clad, Shall march in thy triumphant troop. Thee from the mornings womb I rear'd, Thy youth with pearles of deaw beset, Before the Starre of light appear'd, I of my Substance did beget. 4 The Lord hath sworne, and having sworne, His oath shall no repentance checke: “Thou art a Priest for ever borne, And order'd as Melchizedeck. 5 The Lord at thy right hand in armes, Through Tyrans troups shall make thee way; And stand between thee and thy harmes, To wound even Kings that wrathfull day. 6 He shall be Judge among the Heath'n, And strew the street with bodies dead: With earth lay mighty Armies even, Of many Nations smite the head. 7 The Brooke that meets him by the way, (His hot pursuit shall be so swift) His thirst shall serve him to allay: His head he therefore shall up-lift. Psal. 111. Confitebor tibi, Domine. Acrostichon. Halelu-jah. 1 All hearty praise, and hearts-complaints, to thee, Lord, will I bring: Be is in secret with the Saints, or in the Quire I sing. 2 Great are the actions of the Lord, and greatly after sought: Desir'd of all, in whom his Word a true delight hath wrought. 3 His glory, and his honours praise, his worke all workes obscures: Unto beyond the length of daies, his Justice firme endures. Summes of his marvels left to be memorials on record: How full of clemencie is he! how mercifull the Lord! 5 To them that feare him hath his hand an un-bought portion given: Is mindfull with his Covenants band, for ever to make even. 6 Conquests of power, proud Nations spoiles, he let his people see: Left them and theirs, of Heathen soiles Inheritors to be. 7 Made all of Truth and Judgement are the actions of his hands: No lesse as faithfull, past compare, are all his Precepts bands. 8 Set stedfast are they every one, beyond the length of daies: How truly, how sincerely done, how upright in their waies. 9 Precovenanted Redemption came, his people to restore: Sent in his holy dreadfull Name, commanded evermore. 10 Right entrance, wisedomes ports into, to feare the Lord first lay: So wisely doe they all that doe, their praise shall stand for aye. Psal. 112. Beatus Vir. Acrostichon. Halelu-jah. 1 All blessings blesse the man, that stands of God the Lord in feare: But of delight in his commands, of no delight can heare. 2 Grow mighty shall on earth his seed, about his dwelling place. Daily shall blessings blessings breed, to blesse the righteous race. 3 His house of wealth and treasures heap't, shall be a house of store: What with his Justice he hath reap't, shall stand for evermore. 4 Such light in darknesse shall arise, as lightens hearts upright: Him Grace and Mercy magnifies, his lamp shall Justice light. 5 The good man graciously proceeds, and bountifully lends: In sound advisement weighs his deeds, his words with Judgement spends. 6 Certainly his foundations frame, no adverse storme shall straine, Lasting for ever shall his Name in memorie remaine. 7 Make him to feare the fowle event, none evill heare-say shall: Not so, his heart is fixt and bent, to trust the Lord withall. 8 Set stedfast holds his heart his hold, from feare of perill free; His enemies to ruine sold, till he in safetie see. 9 Poore soules among his Almes are thrown, such Justice daies and daies Continue shall, by bounty growne, his Horne shall honour raise. 10 Repining shall the wicked see, this sight, and pallid ire Shall gnash the teeth, shall melted be to nought with his desire. Psal. 113. Laudate pueri. Halelu-jah. 1 Praise, ye that serve the Lord, proclaime, sing to the Lords Name praise: 2 Blest be the Lords eternall Name, beyond the length of daies: 3 The Lords eternall Name be prais'd, throughout this Sun-race Round; From where the Easterne beames are rais'd, to where the Westerne bound. 4 The Lord is high above the Heathens, Commander in all lands: His glory is above the Heavens, and all their Host commands. 5 Who with the Lord our God compares, whose dwelling is on hie? And yet on Heaven and Earth he cares, and daignes to cast his eie. 6 From dust the down-cast rais'd he takes, from dung the needy cleeres: The poore, with Princes Peeres, he makes his peoples Princes Peeres. 7 He makes the barren dweller breed, and house-build-issue bring: A joyfull mother of her seed, her Halelu-jah sing. Halelu-jah. Psal. 114. In exitu Israel. 1 When Israel out from Egypt went, from Pharaohs heavie hand; And Jacobs house from bondage sent, had left that strange-tongu'd land. 2 His Sanctuary Judah led, his Scepters Israel: 3 The sea that saw, gave way and fled, and Jordan backward fell. 4 The Mountaines leap't, like high-fed Rams among the flockes of sheep: The little Hills, like wanton Lambs, like-wanton revells keep. 5 What ail'd thee, O thou sea, to flie, and leave thy corall bed? That Jordan backe thou turn'dst, and why revolted to thy head? 6 Ye Mountaines, that like Rams ye leap't among the flockes of sheep? Like Lambs, ye ravish't Hillocks heap't, like-raptur'd revells keep? 7 The presence of the Lord compell'd, the earth beyond her law: Of Jacobs God the presence held the trembling earth in awe. 8 Which from the veines of Rockes let bloud, his water-lakes doth bring: And makes into a mighty floud, from flint the fountaine spring. Psal. 115. Non nobis. 1 Not unto us, Lord, not to us, give glory to thy Name: Proclaime it for thy Mercy thus, thus for thy Truth proclaime. 2 And wherefore should the Heathens crie, Where is their God forsooth? 3 Our God is in the Heavens most hie, and what him pleaseth, doth. 4 Their Idols silver are and gold, whose melted masse they serve; Worke, which the hand of man doth mold, and curious is to carve. 5 A mouth they have, but speech none there, and eyes, but casements blind: 6 And eares, but eares that cannot heare, nor scent their noses wind. 7 Hands, where no sense of feeling found, feet, that foot never went; Their senslesse trunkes at all no sound, nor lungs, or throat to vent. 8 Like stuffe to them their makers are, like drosse of divers dust: Like Saints, like Servitors compare, are all that in them trust. 9 Trust in the Lord, O Israel, on him their hopes who build, Their hopes are sure to speed them well, he is their help and shield. 10 Upon the Lord, O Aarons house, your hopes foundation build, Such hopes find him auspicious, he is their help and shield. 11 O ye, in holy reverence, to feare the Lord that yeeld, In whom ye feare, put confidence, he is their help and shield. 12 The Lord to us, remembring well his blessings to expresse, Will blesse the house of Israel, the house of Aaron blesse. 13 Be it your state small meanes afford, sit ye in honours seat; Young, old, that feare the Lord, the Lord will blesse you, small and great. 14 To adde to you, and to your race, the Lord will yet proceed, To multiply on you his grace, on you, and on your seed. 15 The blessed of the Lord ye are, his blessings ye partake: Your Maker, he makes you his care, that Heaven and Earth did make. 16 The Heavens, &amp; Heavens supremest Heaven, the Lord alone commands: The Earth to Adams sons hath given, to serve him in all lands. 17 And though the dead, Lord, of thy praise, no song in silence sing: 18 To praise thee Lord, shall endlesse daies our Halelu-jahs ring. Halelu-jah. Psal. 116. Dilexi quoniam. 1 I Love the Lord, that so lov'd mee, my voice, my praiers to heare: 2 And in my daies will call, for hee to mee inclin'd his care. 3 The pangs of death did wind about, and had beset mee round: The straights of Hell had found me out, distresse and griefe, I found. 4 Upon the Lords Name then I call'd, and ecchoing did repeat: Deliver thou my soule enthrall'd, O Lord, I thee entreat. 5 How gracious is the Lord, and just, our God is mercifull: 6 The Lord the simple keeps, from dust my ransom'd head did pull. 7 Soule, to thy rest returne: for why? the Lord hath rendred thee, 8 My soule from death, from teares mine eye, my feet from falling, free. 9 My walkes before the Lord I make the lands of them that live: 10 I did beleeve, and therefore spake, for greatly did I grieve. 11 I did, as feare and haste conceiv'd, “All men are lyars, say: 12 For bounties from the Lord receiv'd, what gift shall I repay? 13 Salvations cup will I up take, and on the Lords Name call: 14 And of my vowes now payment make, before his people all. 15 His gracious Saints the Lord beholds, his eyes high prize their daies: Their death in deare account he holds, and with revenge repaies. 16 Sure, Lord, I am thy servant, one redeem'd from hostile hands: Thy servant I, thy hand-maids sonne, thou hast unloos'd my bands. 17 A sacrifice of praise to thee my thankfull heart shall frame: My sacrifice, O Lord, shall be to call upon thy Name. 18 My vowes I to the Lord will pay, and put them off no more: But on my hearts pure altar lay his people all before. 19 Lord, in thy houses courts let me, these vowes upon me bring; O Salem, in the midst of thee mine Halelu-jah sing. Halelu-jah. Psal. 117. Laudate Dominum. 1 O praise the Lord, ye Gentiles all, throughout the earth that dwell: Upon his Name all Nations call, his praise all people tell. 2 For towards us his Graciousnesse, his Mercies mighty store; And of the Lord the faithfulnesse, endures for evermore. Halelu-jah. Psal. 118. Confitemini Domino. 1 The Lord is good, with thankes confesse, his mercy is for ever: 2 Let Israel now say no lesse, his mercy faileth never. 3 Now Aarons house acknowledge may his mercy is for ever: 4 Let them that feare the Lord, now say, his mercy faileth never. 5 From where in straight distresse I lay, unto the Lord I cri'd: The Lord made answer, with my way about me made more wide. 6 The Lord for me, I feare not all what man can doe to mee: 7 The Lord my helpers helps, I shall upon my haters see. 8 The hopes that on the Lord are laid, lye safer than on man: 9 Our hopes the Lord can better aide, than powerfull Princes can. 10 All Nations round about me came, conspirers for my fall: But in the Lords more-powerfull Name, I shall cut off them all. 11 They prest in swarmes on every side, on every side they swarm'd: But, Lord, thy Name my weapon tri'd, to cut them off me arm'd. 12 Like swarmes of Bees their forces link't, they round about me bent: Whom, Lord, like fire, in thornes extinct, thy Name shall soon prevent. 13 That I might fall by some offence, thou hast thrust at me sore: But yet, a hand in my defence, the Lord my helper, bore. 14 The Lord is of my strength the summe, the subject of my songs; And my salvation is become, to whom my life belongs. 15 The voice of joy and health is heard in tents where Justice dwells: The right hand of the Lord up-rear'd, in fortitude excells. 16 The right hand of the Lord preferr'd, preheminence hath wonne; The right hand of the Lord up-rear'd, right valiant deeds hath done. 17 Thy deeds in death, Lord, they that dwell, to light have never brought, I shall not die, but live to tell what workes the Lord hath wrought. 18 Thy stripes, O Lord, I feele; some bloud thy chastisement did draw: Yet hath not given me up for food to deaths devouring jaw. 19 The gates of Justice open mee, that I may enter there; And there, O Lord, confesse to thee, that Saints thy praise may heare. 20 Of God the Lord this is the gate, the Just shall enter there: 21 Where thee, my Saviour, celebrate will I, whom thou didst heare. 22 The Stone the Builders did despise, is made head corner-stone. 23 And marvellous is in our eyes this that the Lord hath done. 24 This day, the Lord that gave it light, did unto us commend: This Festivall, from morne to night, let joy and gladnesse spend. 25 Save now, O Lord, send happinesse, Hosanna now we sing: Salvation, Lord, and good successe; Hosanna to our King. 26 Who in the Lords Name comes, Good-speed, faire blessings him befall: We, from the Lords House, whence proceed all blessings, blesse you all. 27 God is the Lord, that light affords, hath given us gladsome mornes: The Host, for sacrifice, with cords bind to the Altars hornes. 28 Thou art my God, I will confesse, that hast exalted me: What then, my God, can I doe lesse, but thy Exalter be? 29 O praise the Lord, beyond all bounds, whose goodnesse doth extend: Whose tender mercy farther sounds, than time shall ever end. Psal. 119. Beati immaculati. Octostichon Acrostichon. 1 All blessed they, in perfect way that undefil'd are sound: That of their walkes, the steps to stay, make (Lord) thy Law their bound. 2 All blessed they, that all their daies, and daily care convert, To keep his Testimonies waies, him seeke with all their heart. 3 As no iniquitie they doe, his waies their walking guide: As stedfast in his pathes they goe, their footing cannot slide. 4 All thy Commandments give command, to doe, as to discerne: To stand to, as to understand, to live in, as to learne. 5 Assisted, O that by thy grace directed were my waies; So should my foot-steps hold their place, thy Statutes be my staies. 6 Abasht confusion should not fall, nor shame on me reflect: While unto thy Commandments all, I had a due respect. 7 An upright heart will I prepare, to make thy praise discern'd, What Judgements of thy Justice are, when I have truly learn'd. 8 All my observance will I make, thy Statutes how to keep: O doe not utterly forsake thy wandring pasture-sheep. Beth. 1 By what meanes may a young best, be sure to cleanse his way: But on thy sayes to set his rest, thy Word his warrant lay? 2 Before all search, with all my heart, as I have sought for thee; So from thy Precepts pathes depart, and wander let not mee: 3 Bound and laid up my heart within, thy sayings have I hid: Against thee that I might not sin, nor doe, as they forbid. 4 Beyond our blessings highest reach, O Lord thou blessed art: O teach me what thy Statutes teach, their pathes to me impart. 5 By utt'rance have my lips not spar'd, their loudest notes to straine: The Judgements of thy mouth declar'd, made all their sentence plaine. 6 Bent on thy Testimonies way, much more did I rejoyce, Than they in store that riches lay, the pride of all their choice. 7 Before all studies, early, late, by setting all essayes: Thy Precepts will I meditate, and well respect thy waies. 8 But in thy Statutes, no delight where, else, my heart to set: Because thy Sayes are so upright, them shall I not forget. Gimel. 1 Give to thy servant this reward, this favour me afford, That living, though beset so hard, I may observe thy Word. 2 Growne darke of sight, my vaile withdraw, the mysteries unfold, That these mine eies may of thy Law, the wondrous things behold. 3 Great stranger I, and wanting light, on earth in darknesse stray: Hide not thy Precepts from my sight, the Lyre to lead my way. 4 Ground is my soule, and broken small, enflam'd is my desire: At all times, mine affections all, thy Judgements set on fire. 5 Given up, the proud dost thou forsake, whom though thy checke deferre; The curse at length shall overtake, that from thy Precepts erre. 6 Growne in reproach, upon me crept, held in contempt to be; Thy Testimonies having kept, O keep these shames from me. 7 Great Princes sate, and fram'd their stile, some fault with me to find: But on thy Statutes all the while, thy servant sets his mind. 8 Good cause, no other joy invites my better-settled care: Thy Testimonies my delights, my men of counsell are. Daleth. 1 Downe cast, and cleaving to the dust, my soule drawes neere the death; According as thy Word is just, revive my dying breath. 2 Declar'd my waies to thee I have, and answer had of thee: Instruction only this, I crave, thy Statutes teach thou mee. 3 Direct me how to understand, what way thy Precepts hold: My Meditations, of thy hand the wonders shall unfold. 4 Dejected soule, so much I grieve, mine eies drop showres of raine: According to thy Word relieve, and raise me up againe. 5 Deceits false way from me withdraw, put lying waies away; And graciously give me thy Law, to be my faithfull stay. 6 Disposer of my feet, the way of faithfulnesse I chose: Thy Judgements I before me lay, and for my guides propose. 7 Drawne from thy Testimonies now, whereto I cleave so fast: I cannot shrinke; upon my brow, Lord, let not shame be cast. 7 Directly in the way will I of thy Commandments runne: Mine heart when thou shalt amplifie, till grace the Goale have wonne. He. 1 How! teach me, Lord, thy Statutes way, the way to apprehend, That make it all my care I may, to keep it to the end. 2 Hide not my understandings light, that I may keep thy Law: From all delights shall this delight mine hearts observance draw. 3 How I may tread thy Precepts path, instruct me in the way: For pleasure else mine heart none hath, no joy, but there to stay. 4 Hold in my heart, enclin'd to heed thy Testimonies will; And not on Avarice to feed, still fed, yet famish't still. 5 Hence, hence mine eies fr? pleasures hook, un-tempted, turne away: Lest after vanitie they looke, revive me in thy way. 6 Here let thy Word performance beare, to me thy servant past: On whom, devoted to thy feare, thy promis'd favour cast. 7 Hold off reproach, which in my way, I am afraid hath stood: For say, what sinfull tongues can say, yet are thy Judgements good. 8 How to observe thy Precepts bounds, loe, my delights aspire: As Justice now in thee abounds, O quicken my desire. Vav. 1 With thy kind Mercy come to mee, and be propitious, Lord, O make me thy Salvation see, according to thy Word. 2 What else to answer shall I have, to mouthes that me upbraid; But that my trust, which they deprave, upon thy Word is laid? 3 Withdraw not from my mouth this scope, the Word of Truth to urge: Because thy Judgements are my hope, thy Truths contemners scourge. 4 Unto for ever in thy Law, my life then will I spend; And till this breath I cease to draw, my service never end. 5 Within a spacious roome forth brought, shall I be walking found: Because thy Precepts I have sought, whereon my steps to ground. 6 Were Kings in presence, I would speake thy Testimonies praise: Nor shame to say, Yeeld Kingdomes weake, stoop Scepters to his Sayes. 7 With thy Commandments, my delight shall (all delights above) Stand best delighted, in my sight sole objects of my love. 8 Up-lifted palmes will I out-stretch, thy Precepts to embrace; And on thy Statutes, what they teach, my meditation place. Zain. 1 Sure promise to thy servant past, as stedfast beare in mind: That where my hopes thou settled hast, performance I may find. 2 Sound comfort yet in this I take, afflicted when I see, All other succours me forsake, thy saying quickens mee. 3 Scorne did the proud, and much deride this serious course of mine: Yet from thy Precepts, for their pride, my feet did not decline. 4 Such Judgements hast thou done of old, as when I call to mind, My courage (Lord) growes then more bold, and comfort thence I find. 5 Straight hold on me did horrour take, when wicked men I saw; And seeing, soon I did forsake forsakers of thy Law. 6 Songs have thy Statutes been to mee, whose Ditties I repeat; And in this Dorter sing to thee, my Pilgrimages seat. 7 Sitting in darknesse of the night, thy Name, when others slept, Have I remembred: my delight, thy Law (Lord) have I kept. 8 Successe, what ever me befall, these benefits I reap't: This was to me, thy Precepts all, because I duely kept. Heth. 1 Have who that will such heaps up-laid, as worldly-wealth affords: My Portion, Lord (as I have said) is to observe thy words. 2 Heartily I besought thy face, with earnest zeale I prai'd: And but performance of thy grace, thy promis'd Mercy stai'd. 3 Heedfully thought I on my waies, what way I held most meet: And to thy Testimonies staies, I turn'd my staylesse feet. 4 Haste made I to avoid neglect, to cut off all delay: As thy Commandments shall direct, to walke no other way. 5 Hindred by wicked robbers bands, that make my goods their prey, Yet have I not in safer hands, thy Law forgot to lay. 6 How oft at midnight doe I rise, to praise thee on my knees: Because thy Judgements are the eyes, wherewith thy Justice sees! 7 Hold all with me in friendships bands, in feare of thee that stand: Observers all of thy commands, my service may command. 8 How farre, O Lord, thy mercies reach, when earth is fill'd thereby! O teach me what thy Statutes teach, to follow, what to flye. Teth. 1 Thy promise stands for good, O Lord, which thou thy selfe hast bound: The like performance of thy Word, have I thy servant found. 2 To me let thy Instruction give good Judgement, to discerne: As in thy Precepts I beleeve, thence knowledge let me learne. 3 Till wise affliction crost my way, I held mine owne accord: My heart un-humbled, went astray, but now I keep thy Word. 4 That thou art good, I find it still, and to doe good, enclin'd: Thy Statutes learne me to fulfill; this good, O let me find. 5 The proud against me forg'd a lie, a falshood for my fall: But with mine heart entire doe I observe thy Precepts all. 6 Their peace and plenty them invite, their heart is fat as grease: But in thy Law is my delight, my plenty, and my peace. 7 These faults are fruits of fairer daies, affliction did me good: For thence I learne thy Statutes waies are truly'st understood. 8 The Law that from thy mouth proceeds, more good to me assignes; And treasures moe, than millions breeds of gold and silver Mynes. Jod. 1 Inspir'd, and fashion'd by thy hand, this spirit ere death withdrawes, O make me made to understand, that I may learne thy Lawes. 2 In them that feare thee, when they see what fruit my hopes afford: Shall joy of heart joyne hopes with me, that wait upon thy Word. 3 I know, O Lord (although severe) thy Judgements are upright: Thy faithfulnesses stripes I beare, thy hand doth justly smite. 4 In thy kind mercies free accord, such comfort on me cast, As to thy servant, on thy Word, by promise is fore-past. 5 In tender mercies come to mee, and quicken up my spirits, That I may live: reviv'd by thee, thy Law is my delights. 6 Infamous shame on them be laid, that proudly me abuse: That perversly my truth upbraid, that on thy Precepts muse. 7 In holy feare such as are growne, thy followers fit to be, Thy Testimonies have they knowne, let them returne to me. 8 In thy Decrees, confirm'd by thee, O let my heart be sound, And so my face, that all may see, shall never shame confound. Caph. 1 Concerning thy salvations stay, my soule lies at receit: And fainting after long delay, upon thy Word I wait. 2 Consum'd, to see thy promise faile, now, faile mine eyes to see: O say, when shall thy Sayes prevaile, when come, to comfort me? 3 Clung, like a bottle in the smoake, dri'd up, and waxen old: Thy Statutes bounds I have not broke, nor them forgot to hold. 4 Cast up thy servants summe of daies, how many are they all: On them that persecute my waies, when will thy Judgements fall? 5 Close have the proud for me digg'd pits, my life from me to draw: Where fraud with force in ambush sits, which suits not with thy Law. 6 Commandments all thou giv'st are true, in faithfulnesse agree: With falshood doe they me pursue, pursu'd, O rescue mee. 7 Consum'd on earth, but little lesse than life from me they tooke: Thy Precepts in this deep distresse, yet have I not forsooke. 8 Call backe my lives low-ebbing tide, as Mercy flowes from thee: And, what thy mouth hath testifi'd, shall be observ'd by mee. Lamed. 1 Long since before the Heavens were laid, thy Word for ever sure; In Heaven, than Heaven, more stedfast stai'd, (Eternall) shall endure. 2 Lasting thy Truth to Age and Age, thy Word a faithfull band: The Earths foundations didst thou gage, and stedfast shall it stand. 3 Lawes for their revolutions bounds, are compast by thy care: This day they stand thy Judgements grounds, for all thy servants are. 4 Led not thy Law my whole delights, with cares so many crost, In mine afflictions cloudy nights, my comforts had been lost. 5 Let be, what ever be my let, were strife it selfe that striv'd, Thy Lawes I never shall forget, by them, by thee, reviv'd. 6 Loose, leave me not, for I am thine, save, but whom thou hast bought: For with this ransom'd soule of mine, thy Precepts have I sought. 7 Laid have for me the wicked wait, to see my soule destroi'd: But on thy Testimonies weight, my studies were emploi'd. 8 Lost in themselves Perfections all, mine eyes have seen to end: But thy Commandments (sums though small) exceeding broad extend. Mem. 1 My soules sole object, motive strong, Lord, how I love thy Law! My Meditation all day long, the load-stone to withdraw. 2 Much wiser than mine enemies, thy Precepts I fulfill; And thou by them hast made me wise, for they are with me still. 3 More than my Teachers am I taught, a higher skill to reach: Thy Testimonies are my thought, my Teachers thus I teach. 4 Much deeper wisedome have I found, than Ages shallow deep: The Elders are not so profound, while I thy Precepts keep. 5 My feet from every evill way, for this have I refrain'd: That from the Rules I might not stray, within thy Word contain'd. 6 My Judgement thine hath not declin'd, to ponder in my thought: To practise what I beare in mind, to doe, as thou hast taught. 7 Much sweetnesse in thy words thou hast, to slake my pallat's drougth; More pleasant in my throat they taste, than honey in my mouth. 8 Minding thy Precepts for my stay, I understanding get: And therefore hate I every way that falshood hath fore-set. Nvn. 1 Now, dangers where on earth I meet, and darksome shades of night: Thy Word a lanthorne to my feet, and to my path gives light. 2 Now I have sworne, performe I will, at no time to neglect, Thy righteous Judgements to fulfill, as Justice shall direct. 3 No meane in mine affliction, Lord, now over-worne with woe: O quicken me, as by thy Word thou hast assur'd to doe. 4 None but free-offrings in good part, Lord, from my mouth accept; And teach me how within my heart, thy Judgements may be kept. 5 No day my soule but in my hand, with deadly snares beset, To doe, as doth thy Law command, yet doe I not forget. 6 Neere to my way, at unawares, the wicked laid their snare: Yet carelesse I of other cares, thy Precepts made my care. 7 None but thy Testimonies tooke for mine Inheritance: For ever, as on them I looke, mine heart for joy doth dance. 8 No daies but in thy Lawes to spend, till life from me depart; And to performe them to the end, have I enclin'd my heart. Samech. 1 Seducers vaine my hatred move, my heart from them to draw: But as I love thy Law, I love observance of thy Law. 2 Secret thou art to me, and shield, to keep thy promise, just: To thee my hopes their service yeeld, and to thy Word I trust. 3 Such as in evill waies have trod, my pathes approach not nie: To keep the Precepts of my God, while I mine heart apply. 4 Sustaine thou me, that I may live, to make thy promise good: Let not my hopes made frustrate, give my head a shamefull hood. 5 Secure my health, I shall be bold of safety in thy sight; And in chiefe price continuall hold thy Statutes my delight. 6 Such fugitives thou tread'st downe all, as from thy Statutes stray: Deceitfully from thee they fall, for falshood is their way. 7 So from the earth the wicked are as drosse by thee remov'd: I therefore have with purer care thy Testimonies lov'd. 8 Such horrour in my flesh for thee, to feele I am afraid: And so severe thy Judgements be, that I am sore dismai'd. Gnaiin. 1 Have Judgement I, and Justice done, unjustly judg'd to stand! O let me not be over-gone by mine oppressors hand. 2 Hold surety for thy servants good, become sufficient baile; And let not mine oppressors proud, to my reproach prevaile. 3 Have not mine eyes bid many a storme, for thy Salvation worne; And when thy Justice would performe thy promise long forborne? 4 Hold on, in mercy to proceed, so with thy servant deale: That what thy Statutes have decree'd, to me thou maist reveale. 5 Here I thy servant, make me sound in understanding grow; And on thy Testimonies ground, my graine of knowledge sowe. 6 High time is, Lord, they be destroi'd, thy vengefull sword to draw, To make their lawlesse labours void, that have made void thy Law. 7 How precious I thy Precepts hold, and therefore love them more Than gold, above the finest gold, tri'd from the richest Ore. 8 How I esteem thy Precepts right, that alwaies truth relate! And I, that in the truth delight, alwaies of falshood hate. Pe. 1 Profound, and marvellously deep thy Testimonies are: Them, as they well deserve to keep, my soule hath therefore care. 2 Port-open'd of thy words gives light, gives light that ever lives; And understandings piercing sight, to simple people gives. 3 Panting with open mouth, a draught I thirsted sore to prove; And made the Precepts thou hadst taught, the wine-presse of my love. 4 Proceed, but so, as Mercies eye in Judgement me behold, With those, that on thy Names supply, by love have taken hold. 5 Put in thy Word, my steps direct, and place them every where, That never wickednesse deject, nor rule above me beare. 6 Protect me from oppressing man, for my redemption pay, That doe what earthly pressure can, thy Precepts keep I may. 7 Procure thy countenances light, on me thy servant shine; And in thy Statutes lesson right these tutor'd steps of mine. 8 Powr'd out in griefe that drowns mine eies, my teares like rivers flow: Thy Law when men I see despise, and in contempt to grow. Tsade. 1 So just thou Lord art in thy deeds, thy promise to acquite: To sentence when thy mouth proceeds, then are thy Judgements right. 2 Such charge thy Testimonies charge, that Justice should attend; Thy promises perform'd at large, thy faithfulnesse commend. 3 Surpriz'd I was with burning zeale, that on my bosome preys: That my distressors so should deale, as to forget thy Sayes. 4 So pure thy Word, as much refin'd the metall tri'd by fire: And thereupon thy servants mind, hath set his hearts desire. 5 Small am I much, and much despis'd, as much affect I not: With me thy Precepts highly priz'd, so have I not forgot. 6 Such Justice is thy Justice tri'd, as evermore remaines, A righteous and a faithfull guide, thy Law the Truth containes. 7 Straitnesse and anguish found my spirits, fast hold on me to get: Yet are thy Precepts those delights, whereon my heart is set. 8 Such Justice, such eternall Right thy Testimonies give: O give me understandings light, that I may learne to live. Coph. 1 Crying, with heart entire I cri'd, heare, Lord, and answer make: To keep thy Statutes for my guide, then will I undertake. 2 Calling upon thee, did I call, from dangers deepest deep; Be thou my Saviour, and I shall thy Testimonies keep. 3 Crying, the twilight I prevent, my call call'd up the day: To wait on thee was mine intent, upon thy Word to stay. 4 Could any eies by watching late, like watch to mine have kept, Upon thy Word to meditate, that wak't, when others slept? 5 Can thy great mercies eare lesse doe, than heare my voice complaine? Thy Judgement, Lord, according to, O quicken me againe. 6 Close-follow'd by a wicked crew, how neere to me they draw! In mischiefe they that me pursue, are farre off from thy Law. 7 Can duty, can default be done, but thou, O Lord, art neere? Truth are thy Precepts every one, all thy Commandments cleare. 8 Continu'd are (I know) of old thy Testimonies sayes: That thou hast founded them to hold beyond the length of daies. Resh. 1 Regard what pressures I sustaine, weigh, and their weight withdraw; Release me, that for all my paine, have not forgot thy Law. 2 Right thou my cause that comes to thee, opprest and hard withstood: Redeem thou me, and quicken me, to make thy saying good. 3 Remov'd is from the wicked farre Salvation, them she flies, That with thy Statutes, tongues to jarre, to seeke them, have no eies. 4 Repeat thy many mercies great, how canst thou them refraine? Thy wonted Judgements, Lord, repeat, to quicken me againe. 5 Ready my Persecutors are, oppressors many mine; Drawne from thy Testimonies care, yet did I not decline. 6 Revolting sinners how I saw, I sorrow to record; How perversly they breake thy Law, and have not kept thy Word. 7 Respect thy Precepts how I love, to quicken zeales desire: Let, Lord, thy loving kindnesse prove, thy mercy blow the fire. 8 Right entrance to thy Word, truth gives, and endlesse as it growes, For ever every Judgement lives, that from thy Justice flowes. Schin. 1 Suppressors of my harmlesse head, together Princes draw: But of thy Word than of their deed, my heart stands more in awe. 2 So much thy Word is my delight, as after care and toile, When from the vanquish't foe in flight, the Victor beares the spoile. 3 Sworne foe I am profest to fraud, and falshood I detest; Yet doth my love thy Law applaud, and there sets up my rest. 4 Seven times, ere one daies Sun descend, to praise thee forth I breake, Thy righteous Judgements to commend, and of their Justice speake. 4 Such peace is given in recompence, to them that love thy Law: No stumbling-blocke shall give offence, no danger them withdraw. 6 Salvation, Lord, my hope attends, for thine attends alone; And dreadlesse of distrustfull ends, thy Precepts have I done. 7 Safe in my soule, my soules delight, thy Testimonies lye; And them have I observ'd aright, and lov'd exceedingly. 8 Strictly thy Lawes are kept by me, and Testimonies thine: To thee no waies can ever be (I know) unknowne of mine. Thav. 1 To thee let my complaint come neere, and lie before thee, Lord: O give me understanding cleere, according to thy Word. 2 The supplication in thy sight, that I preferre, accept; And let thy promise be upright, in my deliverance kept. 3 Then as a fountaines fluent spring, my lips shall utter praise, My tutor'd steps when thou shalt bring, to walke thy Statutes waies. 4 Then of thy Word my tongue shall sound a Psalme, that shall intreat: For just are all thy Precepts found, as Justice is their seat. 5 To help me let thy hand prevaile, when perills me oppose: For (leaving other helps that faile) thy Precepts have I chose. 6 To have of thy Salvation fight, Lord, I have long'd full sore; And in thy Law so I delight, I shall desire no more. 7 Then let my soule but live so long, this ground till I have laid, To make thy praise fill up my song, to get thy Judgements aide. 8 Thy wandring servant gone astray, as shepheard, his lost sheep, O seeke, so mindfull in thy way, thy Precepts prest to keep. Psal. 120. Ad Dominum, cum tribul. Canticum Graduum. 1 In my distresses anguish, When I did lye and languish, Upon the Lord I call'd: No longer he deferr'd mee, But at mine instance heard mee, From where I lay enthrall'd. 2 My soule, O Lord, deliver From lips of lies the quiver, And from a double tongue: 3 False tongue, what gives it to thee? What profit shall it doe thee, When thy fell sting hath stung? 4 Sharp arrowes are lesse cruell, No Juniper, like fewell: So deadly are they not, As are those forked quarrells, As are those wild-fire barrells, The tongues malignant shot. 5 Now, woe is me, these dangers, More strange to me then strangers, That exil'd life re-sents: Against my will constraine me, With Meshech to containe me, And dwell in Kedars Tents. 6 My soule hath too long resting, With him, that peace detesting, Is ever male-content: I am for peace, that love it, And when my speeches move it, for warre then are they bent. Psal. 121. Levavi oculos. Canticum Graduum. 1 Up to the Hills I lift mine eies, from whence will come mine aide: 2 From, with the Lord come my supplies, which Heavens and Earth hath laid. 3 He will not suffer thee to slide, thy foot to tread awry: He will not give, that slumber hide thy keepers wakefull eye. 4 Loe, him that keepeth Israel, shall Israels keeper keep, That on his eye no slumber dwell, his eye-lid lodge no sleep. 5 The Lord, the Lord thy keeper is, his helpe's at thy right hand, To shade thee, spread those wings of his, to lead thee, ready stand. 6 So thee, with scorching heat by day, the Sun-beames shall not smite; Nor shall the Moon thy vigour slay, with vapours of the night. 7 The Lord shall thy preserver be, that thou no evill have; And keep thy soule, that over thee no sting be in the grave. 8 Yea, goe thou out, or come thou in, the Lord shall keep the doore; Be with thee from thou dost begin, protect thee evermore. Psal. 122. Lætatus sum. Canticum Graduum Davidis. 1 It was my joy, amidst our woe, to heare the people say: When to the Lords House we shall goe, O times too long delay! 2 Our feet, in our opprest estates, which presse a stranger land, As heretofore within thy gates, to see (O Salem) stand. 3 Jerusalem is so exact, a Citie of such site: Her stately structures so compact, her to her selfe unite. 4 And thither doe the Tribes frequent, Tribes of the Lord ascend, To Israels Testimonie sent, the Lords Name to commend. 5 There are the Thrones for Judgement set, Thrones, where that Royall seed, The sons that David shall beget, for ever shall succeed. 6 O pray we for Jerusalem, her quiet may encrease: And may faire peace as well love them, that love faire Salems peace. 6 Within thy walls let peace be still, and trusty Warder stand: Thy palaces let plenty fill, with prosper-making hand. 8 My brethren and companions loves, compassion move in mee: Compassion like condition moves, now speake I peace to thee. 9 And seeing Salems Temple here, where Sion-Mount I see; This House the Lord our God holds deare, I will seeke good to thee. Psal. 123. Ad te levavi. Canticum Graduum. 1 To thee, that sitt'st above the skies, that Heavens in-dweller art, I lift up my submissive eies, from vallies of my heart. 2 Loe, as upon their Masters hand, the servants eies depend: As on her Mistresses command, a maidens eies attend; Upon the Lord our God our eies, so waiting are intent, Untill his Graces free supplies, in Mercy us prevent. 3 In Mercy, us (O Lord) exempt, thy Mercy make appeare: For we are fill'd with much contempt, more than our hearts can beare. 4 Our soule is cloi'd above the crowne, we beare beyond our might: With scorne the wealthy weigh us downe; the proud, with high despight. Psal. 124. Nisi quia Dominus. Canticum Graduum Davidis. 1 Except the Lord for us had been, may Israel now say: 2 Had not the Lord their pride fore-seen, whose powers against us lay: 3 Then had they swallow'd us alive, when kindled was their rage, In vaine had been for us to strive, their fury to asswage. 4 The flouds had drown'd us every one, so fiercely did they flow: Above our soule the surge had gone, so mighty did it grow. 5 We had been covered in this cloud, the waters proud-controule, The swelling waters of the proud had over-gone our soule. 6 Blest be the Lord, that them withstood, and frustrate sent away; That hath not given our guiltlesse blood unto their teeth a prey. 7 Our soule is as a bird escap't out of the Fowlers snare: The snare is broke that us entrap't, and we delivered are. 8 The help, whereon our hopes depend, is in th' Eternals Name: He that our help to us doth send, the Heavens and Earth did frame. Psal. 125. Qui confidunt. Canticum Graduum. 1 Whoso commend their trust approv'd, unto the Lords command, Shall, as Mount Sion, not be mov'd, but fast for ever stand. 2 Jerusalem is wall'd with Hills, so bounds the Lord his ground; And evermore the Compasse fills, about his people round. 3 For wickednesses rod shall not upon the Just abutt; Lest thence to draw a wicked lot, the Just their hands forth put. 4 As all good gifts thou dost conferre, Lord, to the good doe good; And, righteous as thou art, preferre the upright-hearted brood. 5 But such, as to their crooked vaine revolt, the Lord shall lead, With them that evill worke with paine: “Peace be on Israels head. Psal. 126. In convertendo. Canticum Graduum. 1 When Sion (Babels captive) thence the Lord did home redeeme: Our ravisht hopes, scarce trusting sense, we were like them that dreame. 2 Our mouth was fill'd with laughter, then for joy no tongue but sings: The Heath'ns could say, for these good men. the Lord hath done great things. 3 Great things indeed, and many too, for us, as well appeares; The Lord hath magnifi'd, to doe, to joy hath turn'd our teares. 4 Turne, Lord, as welcome showres of raine, refresh the Deserts drouth; Our captive Remnant turne againe, like Torrents from the South. 5 They that in furrowes fill'd with teares, the seed of sorrow sowe, When Harvest comes of laden eares, a joyfull crop shall mowe. 6 He going goes, and weeps to see, what deere-bought seed he leaves: Home-comming comes, as joyfull he, and (shouting) beares his sheaves. Psal. 127. Nisi Dominus. Canticum Graduum Solomonis. 1 Except the Lord the house doe build, vaine toile the builder takes: Except the Lord the Citie shield, in vaine the Warder wakes. 2 As vaine it is, ye early rise, late houres of rest ye keep, To eate the bread that sorrow buyes, while his beloved sleep. 3 Loe, children are an heritage, a gift the Lord bestowes: Fruit that revives the fathers age, rewards the mothers throwes. 4 The arrowes from the Mighties hand, with no such terrour goe, As goe the sons of youth, to stand against the fathers foe. 5 Blest is the man, that of such shot hath stor'd his quiver full; Within the gate, their foes shall not reproach upon them pull. Psal. 128. Beati omnes qui. Canticum Graduum. 1 All happinesse, who ever thou art, attend upon thy daies, To feare the Lord that fram'st thy heart, thy feet, to walke his waies. 2 The labour of thy hands, thy messe of savoury meat shall be: Thee, and thy dwelling place to blesse, shall goodnesse dwell with thee. 3 Thy wife, as spreads the fruitfull Vine, thy houses sides shall bound: Thy sons, like Olive-plants, shall twine about thy Table round. 4 These blessings loe, and many more, this life shall here afford; And better farre there are in store, for them that feare the Lord. 5 Such happinesse the Lord to thee shall out of Sion give: The God of Salem shalt thou see, while thou hast day to live. 6 And ended ere thy daies shall be, thy seed to prosper well: Thy childrens children shalt thou see, and peace on Israel. Psal. 129. Sæpe expugnaverunt. Canticum Graduum. 1 Against me my distressors power hath done the worst they may: From since my youth began to flow'r, may Israel now say: 2 Afflictions on my head to fling, full oft have they assail'd, Against me, from my youthfull spring, yet have they not prevail'd. 3 The plowers plow'd upon my backe, and made their furrowes long: 4 The Lord the Just, yet cut the Rocke the wicked made so strong. 5 Let fowle confusion on them light, and send them backe with shame, That looke at Sion in despight, as haters of her Name. 6 Let them be as the grasse that growes, upon the houses top: Which withreth ere the sithe it mowes, and leaves an empty crop. 7 Whose seed un-rooted in the land, is fed with fruitlesse sap; Which neither fills the mowers hand, nor lades the binders lap. 8 So as no passer by shall say, The Lord give good successe: The Name of God the Lord (we pray) you and your labour blesse. Psal. 130. De profundis. Canticum Graduum. 1 Out of the deeps that thou maist heare, Lord, my complaints repaire: 2 Lord, heare my voice, and let thine eare attend my voices praier. 3 Our sins if thou, O Lord, shouldst summe, and marke, where we have miss't: When thy revengefull stroke shall come, who, Lord, shall then subsist? 4 But by forgivenesse of our sinne, thy mercy hath appear'd: And, as our love thy Judgements winne, thy mercy makes thee fear'd. 5 I earnestly expect the Lord, expect his promise just: My soule hath waited for his Word, wherein my hopes put trust. 6 My soule upon the Lord depends, attends for her dispatch; More than for morne the watch attends, more than for morne the watch. 7 With confidence let Israel, attend the Lord therefore: For with the Lord doth Mercy dwell, with him redemption store. 8 And Israel redeem he shall, and make him freedome winne, From all his sorrowes bonds, from all his sorrow-breeding sinne. Psal. 131. Domine non est. Canticum Graduum Davidis. 1 A haughty heart, high-looking eies, O Lord, I never brooke: I wade not in deep mysteries, nor after marvells looke. 2 I still'd my soule, and made it milde, as from the mothers brests, A weanling, as a weanling childe, my soule in silence rests. Trust in the Lord, his time attend, O Jacobs family: Attend his time, that hath no end, from now, eternally. Psal. 132. Memento, Domine. Canticum Graduum. 1 Of David, and his troublous daies, be mindfull, Lord, and how 2 To Jacobs mighty Lord he payes his oathes solemniz'd vow. 3 Nor tent, nor house, my harbour be, repose my bed forbids: 4 To sleep, mine eyes shall pardon me, to slumber, mine eye-lids. 5 Untill a dwelling place I find, where may the Lord remaine, The Mighty One of Jacobs kind, a house to entertaine. 6 Loe, Ephrata we understood, thereof good tidings yeelds: At length, we found it in the wood, in Kirjath-jears fields. 7 Within his house we will goe meet, and there assembled all; Before his foot-stoole, at his feet bow downe our selves, and fall. 8 Arise, O Lord, into thy rest returne, to dwell at length; In Salem, sometime Silo's guest, thou, and thy Arke of strength. 9 Let be (that thine they may be knowne) thy Priests with Justice cloth'd: And (seeking thee more than their owne) thy Saints to joy betroth'd. 10 And for thy servant Davids sake, turne not the face away Of thine Annointed: Soveraignes make his seed, his Scepter sway. 11 The Lord in Truth to David sware, and will not turne from it: Fruit of thy wombe will I prepare upon thy Throne to sit. 12 My Covenant if thy sons retaine, my Testimonies heed; Thy sons perpetually shall raigne, and on thy Throne succeed. 13 For as the Lord loves Sion best, his liking is so great, That her, he hath above the rest, selected for his seat. 14 This is my rest, a longer space, than Sun shall lend his light, Perpetuall here my dwelling place, here my desir'd delight. 15 Her victuals blessing will I blesse, her poore with bread suffice: 16 Her Priests in pure Salvation dresse, her Saints shall joy surprize. 17 There will I make the Horne upright, to bud on Davids head: A lamp for mine Annointed light, throughout all lands to spread. 18 His enemies shall shame befall, and weave the web they weare: Up on his head while flourish shall the Crowne that he shall beare. Psal. 133. Ecce quàm bonum. Canticum Graduum Davidis. 1 Behold how good it is, how pleasing well, That there dwell unity, where Brethren dwell: 2 The precious odour did not sweeter smell, When on the head, the holy Oile that fell, As downe the beard, downe Aarons beard it went, Perfum'd the border of his Vestiment. 3 So fall the pearly gems from Hermon Hill, On Sion Mountaines so the deaws distill; And eithers fields with rich embroidry fill, Powdring the'r un-shorne lockes with various skill: For there, the Lords command the blessing bound, And Brethrens love with life eternall crown'd. Psal. 134. Ecce nunc benedicite. Canticum Graduum. 1 Behold, praise ye the Lord all ye, observers of his Rites, That servants in the Lords House be, before him stand by nights. 2 There, where his Sanctuary stands, to sanctifie his Name: To blesse the Lord, up-lifted hands, let hearts low-humbled frame. 3 And he, whose blessings over-shade the Hill of Holinesse: The Lord, that Heav'ns and earth hath made, thee out of Sion blesse. Psal. 135. Laudate nomen Domini. Halelu-jah. 1 Sing Halelu-jah, praise th' Eternals Name, Ye servants of the Lord, set forth his praise: 2 That in the Lords House stand, his praise proclaime, In our Gods Houses Courts that spend your dayes. 3 Praise Jah: The Lord is good, as then is meet, Sing Psalmes unto his Name, so pleasing sweet, 4 For to himselfe the Lord hath Jacob chose, And his chiefe treasure Israel accounts. 5 Great is the Lord, my knowledge can disclose: And that our Lord all other gods surmounts. 6 What will the Lord have done: his will alone In Heav'ns, Earth, Seas, and all the Deeps is done. 7 From earths extremes he makes the clouds ascend, His fires and waters on the aire he flings; In lightning-shot, and show'rs of raine to spend, The wind out of his treasuries he brings: 8 And branded Egypt bare his furies note, Whose first-borne all, from man to beast he smote. 9 His signes and wonders here and there he sent, Hard hearted Egypt, in the midst of thee, On Pharaoh's head, and all his servants spent: Yet who so blind, as they that would not see: His signes and wonders, sent and spent in vaine, Nor Pharaoh's nor his servants pride restraine. 10 He smote great Nations mighty Kings he slew. 11 As Heshbons Sehon, King of Amorites; And Ghog the King of Bashan overthrew, With all the Kingdomes of the Cananites! 12 And dispossest them of their land, to blesse, And give his people Israel to possesse. 13 Thy Name, O Lord, is ever permanent, Thy memory, Lord, is to age and age: 14 The Lord will judge his people, and repent To execute the rigour of his rage: His servants faults as ready to forbeare, As to their foes in his revenge severe. 15 The Heathens Idols silver are and gold, Worke of mans hand, their makers worth beneath; 16 Mouthes, eyes, eares, noses, can their makers mold; 17 But cannot make them speake, see, heare, nor breathe: 18 Vaine Idoll-mongers, like your Idols just, That Idols make, or in made Idols trust. 19 O blesse the Lord ye house of Israel, O blesse the Lord, ye house of Aarons line: 20 O house of Levi, blesse the Lord: As well Who feare the Lord, to blesse the Lord encline: 21 From out of Sion his high praise record, Whose dwelling is in Salem: Praise the Lord. Halelu-jah. Psal. 136. Confitemini Domino. 1 O praise the Lord, for he is good, his mercy is for ever: 2 Praise him, that is of gods the God, whose mercy faileth never. 3 Praise him, that is of lords the Lord, whose mercy is for ever: 4 His sole-done wonders great, record, whose mercy faileth never. 5 The Heavens, that by his wisedome made, whose mercy is for ever: 6 The earth above the waters spread, his mercy ceaseth never. 7 Which made great lights for severall place, his mercy is for ever: 8 The Sun by day to runne his race, his mercy failing never. 9 The Moon and Starres to governe night, his mercy lasting ever: 10 In their first-borne did Egypt smite, his mercy failing never. 11 And Israel from amidst them brought, his mercy is for ever: 12 With mighty hand, and arme out-rought, his mercy failing never. 13 The red sea into parts did lay, his mercy is for ever: 14 And through the midst made Israel way, his mercy failing never. 15 There shook off Pharaoh and his Host, his mercy lasting ever: 16 His people led through Desert-coast, his mercy failing never. 17 Great Kings he smote, and overthrew, his mercy is for ever: 18 And mighty Kings in battell slew, his mercy failing never. 19 As Sehon King of Amorites, his mercy lasting ever: 20 And Ghog the King of Basanites, his mercy ceasing never. 21 Their land in heritage to have, his mercy is for ever: 22 To Israel his servant gave, his mercy failing never. 23 Which of our humbled state esteem'd, his mercy is for ever: 24 From our distressors us redeem'd, his mercy failing never. 25 Bread to all flesh by whom is given, his mercy lasting ever: 26 Confesse ye to the God of Heaven, whose mercy ceaseth never. Psal. 137. Super flumina Babyl. 1 Downe sate we by the rivers side, that waters Babels wall: To raise whose streames, a springing tide of teares our eyes let fall. Remembring Sion in our vowes, our uselesse Harps we hung 2 Upon amidst the willow boughes, as slightly tun'd as strung. 3 For they that led us captives there, requir'd of us a song; A Sion-song (said) let us heare, these moanes, some mirth among. 4 O no! nor harp we have, nor hand, nor voice to straine, nor string: Our Sion-song, in Shinar-land, song of the Lord to sing. 5 If, O Jerusalem, I set no more by thee than so; Let my right hand her skill forget, my voice her song forgoe. 6 My tongue fast to my palate cling, ac'd never tune employ, If ought I doe but Salem sing, the Soveraigne of my joy. 7 Be mindfull, Lord, of Edoms sons, who said on Salems day, Raze, Raze, to her foundations, with earth her levell lay. 8 Thou Daughter, Babel, laidst us waste, thy selfe shalt wasted be: O happy! that as done thou hast to us, shall doe to thee. 9 O happy! that thy little ones, from mothers breasts shall rash, And (pitilesse) against the stones, their braines in pieces dash. Psal. 138. Confitebor tibi. Davidis. 1 I will confesse thee to their face, with all the heart in mee, Were Princes, Angels, Gods in place, Psalmes will I sing to thee. 2 Prostrate before thy holy Seat, thy Name will I confesse; Thy tender mercies there repeat, and sing thy faithfulnesse. For all thy powerfull deeds proclaime, and ample proofe afford, That thou hast magnifi'd thy Name, above all Name thy Word! 3 The day I cri'd, to thee I cri'd, thou heardst, and answerdst mee: My soule with vigour was suppli'd, and strengthned much by thee. 4 Kings of the earth shall all confesse, and make thy praise appeare; When of thy mouth, the faithfulnesse, the words (O Lord) they heare. 5 Their songs shall of the waies entreat, that to the Lord belong: For of the Lord the glory great, is subject of their song. 6 For though the Lord be thron'd on hie, yet are his eies below: The lowly-hearted ever nie, the proud afar to know. 7 Amidst distresse although I went, reviv'd by thee I stand: Thy hand against my haters sent, to save me, thy right hand. 8 This worke, the hand that wrought me this, the Lord accomplish will: Thy mercy, Lord, for ever is, thy handy-worke fulfill. Psal. 139. Domine, probasti. Ad Præstantem, Davidis Psalmus. 1 Thou hast, O Lord, me searched out and knowne, 2 My sitting downe, and my up-rising are Within thy knowledge, cleerer than mine owne: My thoughts un-thought, thou understandst afarre, 3 My path, my pallet, winnow'd with thy fan, And all my waies thy custome is to scan. 4 For in my tongue there teem's not any word, The breathlesse infant of my pregnant thought, But loe, un-borne, thou know'st it wholly, Lord, Though with the organs of my speech un-wrought: 5 Behind, before, thou hast beset me straight, And of thy hand upon me put the waight. 6 It is too wonderfull for me to know, To it[illeg.] cannot it is set so hie: 7 O, from thy spirit whither shall I goe? And whither shall I from thy presence flie? 8 If I ascend the Heavens, the Heavens thee beare; Make I my bed the Hell, loe thou art there. 9 Take I the early-rising mornings wings, And utmost seas my uncouth dwelling make, 10 Even thither me thy hand my leader brings, And thy right hand fast hold on me shall take: 11 Yet sure shall darknesse shrowd me, if I say, The night about me shall be light as day. 12 For light-lesse darknesse, darkneth not from thee, But as the day, before thee shines the night: Where seeing sees not, thou hast eyes to see, As darknesse is to thee, so is the light. 13 My reines are but the texture of thy loome. Thou coveredst me within my mothers wombe. 14 For casting me in such a covert mold, My praise shall of thy fearfull wonders tell; How marvellous thy workes are to behold, My soule cannot expresse, yet knowes right well. 15 No bone of mine from thee is hid to know, Though close embroidred in the earth below. 16 Thine eyes did on my shapelesse substance looke, And fram'd my members from a formlesse masse; Each one of them is written in thy booke, What day they formed were, when none there was. 17 How precious are, O God, thy thoughts to mee, Of their increase what mighty summes I see! 18 To number them, to number were the sand, As oft as I awake, I am with thee: 19 That thou, O God, wouldst slay the wicked band, And men of blouds: Depart ye all from mee: 20 Which speake of thee what mischiefe can devise, And, but lift up in vaine, thine enemies. 21 And doe not I, Lord, them that hate thee, hate, And grieve at those that up against thee rise, As if with me thy haters held debate, As if they me despis'd, that thee despise? 22 In hatreds full perfection them I hate, And in the number of my foes relate. 23 Search me, O God, my secret angles sound, And of my heart exactest knowledge take, Examine mine intentions from their ground, Of all my thoughts a perfect audit make. See whether I in sorrowes by-path stray, And lead me in the everlasting way. Psal. 140. Eripe me Domine. Ad Præstantem, Psalmus Davidis. 1 The evill man, the violent, from me, O Lord, keep farre: 2 Whose heart on mischiefe wholly bent, they daily gather warre. 3 They, like a Serpent, whet their tongue, beneath their lips beare stings; With Aspes fell poyson to be stung, lesse deadly danger brings. Selah. 4 Lord, keep me from the wicked hand, and from the violent; To thrust away my feet, which stand, and study to prevent. 5 For me the proud have hid a snare, with cords wide spread a net: Way-laid my path at un-aware, their grins for me have set. Selah. 9 Thou to the Lord my God, I said, to heare this voice of mine, A suitor to thy grace for aide, thine eare, O Lord, encline. 7 Lord God my strength, my strength to lead, my saving health from harmes: Thou sett'st the Helmet on my head, upon the day of Armes. 8 Lord, wicked men encourage not, nor grant them their desire, O further not his crafty plot, lest further they aspire. Selah. 9 Upon my chiefest haters head, that compasse me about, A covering of their lips to spread, let mischiefe marke them out. 10 Let burning coales on them descend; hot fire on them let fall: And into dungeons deep them send. whence rise they never shall. 11 A man of tongue shall never grow establish't in the land: But evill, to his overthrow, shall hunt the griping hand. 12 I know, the Lord will Justice frame, the poore opprest to quit: The Just shall sure confesse thy Name, the right, before thee sit. Psal. 141. Ad te, Domine. Psalmus Davidis. 1 To this complaint, O Lord, of mine, thy speedy help apply: Thine eare unto my voice encline, when unto thee I cry. 2 As incense, let my praier be sent, and right before thee rise; Let mine up-lifted palmes present an evening sacrifice. 3 Set, Lord, a watch my mouth before, my wandring tongue to tie; And of my lips keep fast the doore, whence words have wings to flie. 4 To evill further not my heart, pretences to pretend: Their dainties let me eate no part, whom wicked deeds commend. 5 But smite me, let the Just in love, his hand up-lifted lights; Compassions his reprovings prove, his Mawle in mercy smites. Such balme (none such the wicked powre) shall never breake mine head: For in their evills evill houre, my praier for them shall plead. 6 Their Judges, though by hands of rockes, lie fell'd beneath our feet, To heare my sayings, swarme by flockes, for they are pleasing sweet. 7 Our scattred bones together put, the mouth of Hell receives, As stone on earth from Quarry cut, as chips the cleaver cleaves. 8 But unto thee, O God the Lord, mine eyes attendant looke, When help thou wilt my hopes afford, leave not my soule forsooke. 9 Preserve me from the handed-snare, which they for me have laid, And grins, for which their wicked care, with cost and paine hath paid. 10 But let the wicked downe be cast, his toile his taker be: While I, together over-past, his fall, my safety see. Psal. 142. Voce mea ad Dominum. Maschil Davidis, cùm esset in spelunca, oratio. 1 My voyce, up to the Lord, I strain'd, and shew'd my wofull case; My voyce, unto the Lord complain'd, and humbly su'd for grace. 2 My meditation I prepar'd, before him to expresse; Before his face, have I declar'd, and powr'd out my distresse. 3 When, sunk my spirit within me lay, my path then didst thou know; A snare to walk on, in my way, they closely did bestow. 4 On my right hand I lookt, and saw, to know me there was none: All refuge did from me withdraw; to seeke my soule, not one. 5 To thee, ô Lord, I cry'd, and said, to thee my hopes arrive; My lot before me thou hast lay'd, the land of them that live. 6 Consider my complaint, to thee, attend my low-brought cry: From my pursuers rescue me, they stronger are than I. 7 My soule out of close prison bring, I shall confesse thy Name; The just about me in a ring, thy bountie shall proclaime. Psal. 143. Deus exaudi. Psalmus Davidis. 1 Heare, Lord, my prayer, my suits entend, which I for grace to thee, And to thy faithfulnesse commend, in justice answer me! 2 And enter not by judgements right, thy servants sins to sound; For justifi'd shall in thy sight, not one that lives be found. 3 My soule, is by my foe pursu'd, my life, to earth, lies smit: Among the dead, for ever mew'd, in darknesse set, to sit. 4 My spirit, within me spent, hath left my understanding craz'd: My troubled heart, of rest bereft, amidst me lyes amaz'd. 5 I call to mind the daies of old, on all thy worke I muse; Thy deeds my serious thoughts behold, what passe thy hands peruse. 6 To thee I stretch forth either hand, thy help to entertaine: My soule for thee, as weary land, thirsts after welcome raine. Selah. 7 Haste Lord and heare, my spirit is done, hide not thy face from me: Like them that downe the pit are gone, lest else made soon I be. 8 Thy morning mercy make me heare, in thee I trust, to mee The way I am to walke make cleere, I list my soule to thee. 9 From my pursuing enemies, O Lord, deliver me: That where my safeties shelter lies, for covert flie to thee. 10 Thou art my God, to doe thy will, O make me understand, To guide me, thy good Spirit instill, where right commands the land. 11 And for that Names sake of thine owne, thou, Lord, shalt quicken mee: As for thy Justice thou art knowne, my soule from pressure free. 12 Against my foes thy power employ, make strong thy Mercies arme: My soules distressors all destroy, that me thy servant harme. Psal. 144. Benedictus Dominus. Davidis. 1 Blest be the Lord, my Rocke of Might, my Fortresse, never farre: By whom my hands are taught to fight, my fingers fram'd for warre. 2 My Mercy, my strong Hold, my Towre, my Saviour, and my Shield: In whom I trust, and by whose power, to me my people yeeld. 3 Lord, what is man, that thy respect, to know him, takes such care? Why on the sons of man reflect, and reckon what they are? 4 Man is of vanity a masse, made up, on earth to creep; Whose daies, as slides the shadow, passe to death, the house of sleep. 5 Thy Heav'ns, O Lord, bow and come downe, with tempests warning stroke; And with thy clouds, the Mountaines crowne, but touch, and they shall smoake. 6 Lighten thy lightnings fi'ry darts, to scatter them withall: Send home thine arrowes to their hearts, and, troubled, make them fall. 7 Thy saving hand send from on hie, for my deliverance stand: Rid from the many waters nie, freed from strange childrens hand. 8 Whose mouth of vanitie the mold, dissembles in their stile: On falshood, whose right hand takes hold, a right hand full of guile. 9 To thee, O God, prepare will I, a new-set song to sing, On ten-string'd Lute and Psalterie, with sound of voice and string. 10 His gift it is whereby Kings stand, salvation that they have; Doth from the sword in mischiefes hand, his servant David save. 11 Release me from strange childrens hand, whose mouth the mint of lies; Whose right hand, right hand is to band, and vent vaine forgeries. 12 Which say, “Our sons young plants shall grow; the daughters we beget, Like polish't angles on a row, in Royall Palace set. 13 That yeelding sorts of meats and meats. our Garners never cease: Our flockes bring thousands in our streets, ten thousands of encrease. 14 Our Oxen fed, to labour stout, the burthen, strong to beare: No breaking in, none going out, our streets no clamour heare. 15 O blessed people! (people say) with goods, not goodnesse stor'd: O, rather blessed people they, whose good is God the Lord. Psal. 145. Exaltabo te, Deus. Tehillah ??????????? Davidis. Acrostichon, deest Nun Hebr. 1 Advance thy praise, my King, O God, will I, and I will blesse thy Name perpetually: 2 Blessing thee every day will I dispend, to praise thy Name my song shall never end. 3 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be prais'd, and to his greatnesse can no search be rais'd. 4 Deeds done by thee shall age to age commend, to shew thy powers, posterities contend. 5 How beauteous is thy glorious Majestie, words of thy marvells meditate will I. 6 Whose dreadfull power to speak they shall not spare, as for thy greatnesse, that will I declare. 7 Summes of thy goodnesse shall mens minds employ, to sing thy Justice, they shall shout for joy. 8 How full of grace with pity how repleat the Lord! long-suffring, and in mercy great. 9 To all, the Lord his goodnesse sendeth downe, and all his workes his tender mercies crowne. 10 In praising thee, Lord, all thy workes confesse, and (blest in being thine) thy Saints thee blesse. 11 Cleere glory of thy Kingdome they shall tell, and with thy glory speake what power doth dwell. 12 Let Adams children know his mighty hand, his Kingdomes comely honour understand 13 Measure of time thy Kingdomes raigne transcends, and thy Dominion age and age extends. 14 Sustainer is the Lord of all that fall, and them that crooked are, erecteth all. 15 Intent on thee their eyes all creatures bend, and thou, in time to them their meat dost send. 16 Plentifully, with open hand, at will, each living things desire thou dost fulfill. 17 So just the Lord in all the waies he goes, so mercifull in all the workes he does. 18 Callers on him to all the Lord is me, to all that call upon him faithfully. 19 Requests all granted, shall his fearers have, to heare their cry, and them distrest to save. 20 So all that love him, will the Lord sustaine; and of the wicked, let not one remaine. 21 To praise the Lord, my mouth a song shall frame, all flesh for ever blesse his holy Name. Psal. 146. Lauda anima mea Dominum. Halelu-jah. 1 O praise the Lord, my soule, as long as life (Lord) lends me daies: 2 Thy praise (while I!) shall be my song, my God, to sing thy praise. 3 In Princes, and in Adams son, whose substance is but dust, With whom is no salvation, repose no settled trust. 4 Who, when his prisoned spirit goes forth, turnes to his earth againe: That day his thoughts are nothing worth he travell'd with in paine. 5 O happy he, that hath fore-laid, to be his strong abode, The God of Jacob for his aide, his hope, the Lord his God. 6 Which made the heav'ns, the earth, the deeps, and what they all containe: His promise faithfully who keeps, for ever to remaine. 7 Which judgeth those that suffer wrong, gives to the hungry bread: The Lord from chaines and fetters strong, sets loose the captive head. 8 The Lord gives light to lightlesse eies, restores the blind to sight: The Lord erects that crooked lies, the Lord the Just loves right. 9 The Lord keeps strangers from distresse, of Orphans is the stay: Relieves the widow comfortlesse, subverts the wicked way. 10 The Lord, upon his Royall Throne eternally shall raigne; Thy God, O Sion, King alone, shall age and age remaine. Psal. 147. Laudate Dominum. 1 Praise God, for it is good to sing, a song of praise is sweet: To praise our God a pleasant thing, his praise, a practice meet. 2 Of his Jerusalem the walls, the Lord builds up againe; The scattred out-casts home recalls, His Israels remaine. 3 His hand the broken-hearted heales, their depth of sorrow sounds: Safe medicine for their sicknesse deales, binds up their bleeding wounds. 4 The number of the Starres he tells, and gives them names expresse: 5 Great is the Lord, his Power excells, his Prudence numberlesse. 6 The Lord lifts-up the meeke on wings, to base oppression thrust; But head-long downe the wicked flings, and drownes their pomp in dust. 7 O sing unto the Lord with praise, with praise of voice and string; High to the Harp our voices raise, Psalmes to our God to sing. 8 Which covereth Heav'ns with clouds, below for earth prepares the raine; On Mountaines cliffes makes grasse to grow, as on the Meadowie-plaine. 9 Which to the Nation of the beast, their feeding doth supply; And gives the sons of Ravens a feast, when they for hunger cry. 10 He takes no pleasure in the might, and mannage of the Horse; Nor in the legges of man delight, supporters of his force. 11 The Lords delight is on them set, that on his feare depend: That to his Mercy seeke to get, whereon their hopes attend. 12 O Salem, laud the Lord Most-Hie, Sion, thy God confesse: 13 For he thy gates doth fortifie, thy sons within thee, blesse. 14 He in thy border settleth peace, from feare of hostile hand: With kidnies fat of wheats increase, he loads thy labour'd land. 15 The earth his blessings doth afford, at his commanding will; And very swiftly runs his Word, his Precept to fulfill. 16 He from his clouds, with scattring gale, like lockes of wooll gives snow; Doth on the Hill, the Downe, the Dale, hoare-frosts, like ashes, strow. 17 His ice, like morsels, forth he casts, to bind the streames in bands: Before his cold-congealing blasts, who stands, that them withstands? 18 He sends his Word, that wills them melt, his South-wind bids to blow; Whose thawing breath no sooner felt, the frozen waters flow. 19 His Word of truth, whereon to trust, to Jacob hath he told: His Statutes and his Judgements just, taught Israel to hold. 20 He hath not so in any case, with any Nation dealt; Nor with like knowledge of his grace, his Judgements have they felt. Halelu-jah. Psal. 148. Laudate Dominum. Halelu-jah. 1 Ye Quiristers of Heavenly Quire, to praise the Lord Most-Hie, From Heaven, whereto our Hymnes aspire, confesse him from on hie. 2 Ye Angels all, that in a ring, about his Throne attend: His praise in heavenly consort sing, him all his Hosts commend. 3 O Sun, the Soveraigne of the day, and Moone, the Queen of night; His praises Sun and Moon display, with all the Starres of light. 4 Ye Heavens of Heavens, confesse him all, about your Spheres that move: From Aire's mid-region, ye that fall, cold waters from above. 5 To praise the Name of God the Lord, their part each creature beare: For his Commandment gave the word, and they created were. 6 Their Order, and eternall Round, by him establish't was; His Law, their limits certaine bound, they have no power to passe. 7 Dragons and Whales, your deepest note, to praise the Lord compose; That range in Soiles or Seas remote, his praise all Deeps disclose. 8 Fire, Haile, Snow, Vapour, stormy Wind, his ministers at hand; To burne, to bruise, to lose, to bind, to doe his Words command. 9 Mountaines, Hills, Desert, or in Field, Trees, free-growne, planted; all, As well that fruit by culture yeeld, as Laric-Cedars tall. 10 Wild Beast, that Cave or Covert keeps, all Cattell, every thing, On mother-earth as well that creeps, as aire-cut Fowle of wing. 11 Kings great on earth, to Soveraigne's-Great, all Subjects that belong: Princes, and all on Judgements Seat, that judge Earths right and wrong. 12 Young Men and Maidens, whose fresh flow'rs of youth begin to bloome: Old Men and Children, whose best powers are past, or yet to come. 13 The Lords Name let them praise, for hie his Name is rais'd alone; Above the earth his Majestie, above the Heavens his Throne. 14 And he hath rais'd his peoples Horne, a praise his Saints hold deare; Of Israel the children borne, a Nation to him neere. Psal. 149. Cantate Domino. Halelu-jah. 1 Sing to the Lord a new-set song, un-heard in former daies: His Saints assemblies sing among, and celebrate his praise. 2 With joy his Makers praise to sing, let Israel make choice; As loyall Subjects to their King; let Sions sons rejoyce. 3 To praise his Name with Flute and Dance, his praise in consort sing, With Timbrels touch his praise advance, with Hymnes and Harps sweet string. 4 The Lord is with his people pleas'd, the meeke in heart cast downe, With his Salvations beauty eas'd, with glorious Wreath to crowne. 5 In glory let the Saints rejoyce, in holy company; And shout at home with joyfull noise, as on their beds they lye. 6 Of Gods high praises, let the word within their throat resound; And in their hand a two-mouth'd sword, on each side sharp, be found. 7 The Heath'ns with vengeance to pursue, with pride, that so did swell: The Nations, with reprovings due, to checke, when they rebell. 8 To bind their Kings in captive chaines, and leave their Hosts no head: Their Nobles, with their lordly traines, in iron bolts to lead. 9 To execute the Judgement writ, upon them every one: Such honour as doth best befit, to all his Saints be done. Halelu-jah. Psal. 150. Laudate Dominum. Halelu-jah. 1 O praise God in his Holinesse, his firmament of might: 2 His powers, his greatnesse numberlesse, with boundlesse praise recite. 3 His praise let sound of Trumpet ring, praise him with Lure and Lyre: 4 Praise him with Tymbrel, Flute, and String, with Organ fill the Quire. 5 Praise him with Cymbals sounding shrill, his praises great record: Let loudest-sounding Cymbals fill: “Let all breath praise the Lord. Psal. 151. Ex Additione Apollinarii. 1 Sam. cap. 17. 1 Of all my brethren, I (the least) my Harp and Song assai'd; And while my flocke was at their feast, to feast their Master plai'd. 2 Such happinesse have Shepheards crew, that know no further care: How happy were they, if they knew, how happy men they are! 3 That common not, where clamours dwell, nor covet but their owne; Nor to their Betters knowne too well, dye to themselves unknowne. 4 But ah, my Shepherds fare, farewell, farewell my flocke of sheep; My little flocke, who kept you well, must you no longer keep. 5 Yet Harp and Song, that Shepherd sings, to whom the Muse is given, May change a straine, and sing of Kings, may sing the King of Heaven. 6 Say then, what Angel came to call Heavens Champion forth to fight, Against Heavens foe, and in his fall put all his Host to flight? 7 A man of Gath, an Infidell, with him, at handy-strokes, Of all the Host of Israel, a Combatant provokes. 8 His limbes were vast, and ample nerv'd, his weapons not a few: His sword and shield, the Saint he serv'd, his Idols serv'd for shew. 9 My Brethren valiant were and strong, but God had not decreed, To them the glory should belong, of this Heaven-sorted deed. 10 God gave me courage to confound this crest-swolne Pythons power; To batter downe, and bring to ground this cloud-threat Babel Tower. 11 Full forty dayes this Behemoth came, to our hearts griefe to heare, Blaspheming Gods Almighty Name. Like Weavers beame, his Speare. 12 No Speare brought I, nor Bow, nor Bill, of Armour use had none: To charge a Sling I had some skill, and thence discharge a stone. 13 Wherewith, if right his Murrion sit, may I but see his face, My thunder-handed bolt shall hit the destin'd speeding-place. 14 Enrag'd, mine eldest brother cri'd, This fight com'st thou to see? Avant, proud Boy: I soon repli'd, Is here no cause for mee? 15 More calm King Saul: My heart (holds) good, yeeres (doubts) too few, in truth: Gath flesh't in battels, broiles, and blood, a kill-man from his youth. 16 But I, What is he more than man? Let no mans heart (said) saile: Against six cubits and a span, shall not Heavens Arme prevaile? 17 A Lion and a Beare surpriz'd, and slaine my right hand hath: This Philistine uncircumcis'd, What is this man of Gath? 18 Comes Gath to shed our bloud for spoile, as wine-presse sheds the grape? Or doth his Ekrons hungry soile, for Judah's Cities gape? 19 With him to deale doe I desire, these Rephaims force to feele: Although his hands were hands of fire, or gads of burning steele. 20 The Lion and the Beare for might, were much the better part: But man to man is equall fight, the odds is in the heart. 21 Admit with sithe he mowe his beard, with harrow rake his head: His Lance be like a maine-mast rear'd, an iron racke his bed! 22 I bring to field (and God before) as many hands as he: A better cause, and courage more, and these are Armes for me. 23 The iron he is wont to weare, who blames me to refuse? As much perhaps as I can beare, much more than he can use. 24 He comes to me with Sword and Shield, with steel'd-head Speare in hand; Arm'd with his Name, come I to field, that Armies can command. 25 Then he, thy dreame-beleeving boasts, old Jesse's beardlesse sonne: Thine Host, thine Hosts, Lord God of Hosts, accurs'd be all, as one: 26 What honour shall my Combate gaine, with Shepherd Rivall shar'd: Of thee, when men shall say (though slaine) yet this was he that dar'd. 27 The only man of all his Host, so often urg'd thereto: What none durst doe, who durst doe most, that undertooke to doe. 28 That dar'd with one, that did excell, encounter hand to hand: In which encounter though he fell, he fell, where none durst stand. 29 Thy glory will be easie bought, a deathlesse victorie, With me fit match, but to be thought, though purchas't with to die. 30 Give me a man, my equall match, where like proportion lies: With Flies men may not Eagles catch, and Eagles catch no Flies. 31 Ye Reeds of Judah, raise high wind, and Trumpet loud of warre: But we by proofe, asunder find, your sound and substance farre. 32 Why, Race of leaves? why, shades on wall, why should your female feare, Since fall ye must, refuse to fall by great Pelesheths speare? 33 By us to have been overcome, what losse shall ye sustaine? Sometime to have been lost, to some hath prov'd the loosers gaine. 34 Yeeld us your Lords, and home returne, possesse your daies in peace: With sword, incense not fire to burne, thy Braves, Ben-Jesse, cease. 35 Five thousand shekels weight of brasse, my coat of Maile out-weighes: Six hundred iron shekels masse, upon my speare-pile playes. 36 Beneath this weight thou scarce canst stand, scarce this bare burthen beare: But much more heavie my right hand, dye, ere thou feele, for feare. 37 Adde then my Helm, Sword, Shield, &amp; Lance, a second load alone, Too bigge for thee but to advance, Brat, with thy feeble bone! 38 Thou hast three brethren arm'd in field, were all your strength in one; All foure could not one Anak yeeld, to combat me alone. 39 More blest hadst thou abode at home, and serv'd thy fathers slaves, Than, Wretch, with me to cope have come, as to a dogge with staves. 40 In scorne, my sword is stain'd with none, before my wroth be whet: Now scorne and anger joyne in one, what rage shall both beget? 41 Thy bowels, and white-marrow'd bones, shall therefore wild beasts eate: Thy braines beat out with bats and stones, shall be the Vultures meat. 42 What help! I had no reaching dart, no tackling, but a thong: A sling my weapon; but a heart above all weapon, strong. 43 Thy railing challenge speakes thee base, in termes blasphemous flung: Nor suits it with a souldiers grace, to be so: ranke of tongue. 44 A Lions head (Foole) can out-beard an host of heartlesse Hinds: The greatest men (is often heard) beare not the greatest minds. 45 Thy Helme and Target trust thou not, with those unwieldy thighes: The compleat-arm'd Rhinocerot, looke where he falls, he lies. 46 Thine Armours load, but laggs faint heart, for flight the more unfit: The bigger man thou art, thou art the bigger marke to hit. 47 Thou hast not soule enough to cramme, that Carricks every chinke: The hugest Hulke that ever swamme, a small sprung leake may sinke. 48 When Aire and Water fall to myre, the purest from to fall, The soule of Elements, the fire, is spher'd above them all. 49 No sparke of that Ethereall flame, inspir'd thine earth-borne birth: As from the earth thy Chaos came, thou hast a soule of earth. 50 As earth, thy mother groan'd in paine, when she thy burthen gave: Thy breath, between thy teeth constraine, and groaning gnaw thy grave. 51 But most, to make thy quarrell good, must grounded cause be given: Thy vantage is but flesh and bloud, mine is the hand of Heaven. 52 What fury forc't thee on these pikes, forlorne attempt to give? “At Heaven who strikes, himselfe he strikes, and hath not long to live. 53 Of five, I chose one pibble round, that levell flew as line; And in his fore-head sunke a wound; Thou hast it, Philistine! 54 Now, for mine owne I can thee claime! “To Ida's faire-ey'd Swaine, “The Delian gave not so good aime, “when Thetis son was slaine. 55 God, even our God, of Mighties most, whom thou revild'st this day, By me, the meanest of his Host, hath sent thee death for pay. 56 His sword then drew I from his side, and groveling on the land, As he the living God defi'd, at once, with either hand, 57 His head I from his shoulders strooke, there our Colossus fell; So this reproach Ben-Jesse tooke from honour'd Israel. 58 Thou, Vale of Elah, saw'st this fight, that cost Goliaths head: Thou, Vale of Elah, saw'st this flight, when lost Pelesheth fled. 59 Ye neighbour Groves, and ecchoing Trees, heard Gath on Dagon call: Proud Ashteroth, beneath our knees, saw Ekrons Idols fall. 60 For joy let Judah shout to God, while Gath and Ekron howle; My soule a valiant march hath trod, a valiant march my soule.
