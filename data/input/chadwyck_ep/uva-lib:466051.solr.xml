      <field name="fulltext">[In despite of many thousands] In despite of many thousands Of your General Unnervers, Daddy Time, including Kickers, Lobs, and meteoric Swervers, All the stumps as yet are standing Of my long-defended wicket, And I'm here to hum a ballad Gay with memories of Cricket. TO KING CRICKET Begotten by a County in the South; Reared by that County; disciplined on grass, You took the rest of England with a stump, A bat, a ballâtoo solid for a lass. You smiled among the farms and chose a crop Of suitable servants; quarry, tanyard, mill Were quick to spare from valley, plain, and hill The human stuff to work your radiant will. Though Drake and Ralegh dared stupendous seas, To glorify Britannia's neck with gems As large as any stones that, flinging fire, Gave various souls to foreign diadems, I question if this pair of buccaneers, At loggerheads with Spain in floating forts, Steered bigger values homeward to our ports Than riches given by you, Great King of Sports! Historians never shall arise with wits Alert enough to chronicle in prose Your full success. You kept our bodies taut, You sharpened us, you poised us on our toes; And when the Eagle of the Rhineland screamed For bayonets, and Khaki was the mode, You tossed your playful weapons on the load That creaked in mud along a Flanders road. You spread abroad, as bothered rivers spread To flood our earth. The westward Indian glides Young Larwood to the palings; Hottentots Avoid with care sub-equatorial wides; Bewildered Turks have seen a Cockney bang Half-volleys near the Jordan, and have known A Major's fury when, as hard as stone, The leather crashed against his funny-bone. This is an Empire vowed to buckskin boots And measured creases. Merrily we found Academies on turf, though rank and rough; Pick friendly foes; and do our best to pound The crimson circle to a bruised ellipse. If Nyren may remove from shadowy bands Of demi-gods, be sure that Nyren stands Among the crowd, twitching his cheated hands! Thousands of girls with boyish appetite For stolen runs invade the level greens Reserved so long to give the rougher sex A chance to bully leather to the screens. They pack pavilions when the Kangaroo And Lion grimly front their fate at Lord's, And steal with cameras the sunburnt lads To whose ability sweet Fortune adds The right to sport their international pads. Small wonder that so many lips have brushed The foam of Barleycorn's October beer In salutation of Your Majesty! Small wonder that the Byegones hobble near On sticks and crutches, noting in the cool And tall pavilions how the youngsters tend The Hambledonian heritage, and spend Their muscle on a Monarch and a Friend! THE NETS At last our Nets in early Spring Salute the death of Winter. The virgin ball is here to sting, The wounded bat to splinter. Now two-and-twenty yards of green Perfection claim the leisure Of those to whom this length of turf Appears a royal measure. So it is! Delighted veterans, who have lived For fifty grey Decembers, Begin to coax a feel of youth Along their stiffened members. The weedless two-and-twenty yards, With signs of heavy rolling, Receive their praise as fine and fit For batting and for bowling. So they are! Young England flushes in the field, Alert, enthusiastic! Responsive sinews stretch in him As blithely as elastic. His share of keen paternal blood, As though a draught of toddy, Is burning in the crowd of veins That irrigate his body. So it should! Beyond the nets a colony Of lilac forms a shelter, Where, hidden in a house of bloom, A thrush sings helter-skelter. While semi-breves of willow wood Consort with silvery quavers We dare to think that timber beats A bird in granting favours. So it does! LISTEN! The clapper of a bell Is publishing the sound That England loves so well In Maytime. Clear the Ground! By hundreds form a Ring In tune with Ball and Bat, And anywhither fling Such care as killed a cat! BACK NUMBERS 1 He's grossly fat. He puffs and grunts While walking slowly down the street, Ballooned by tarts and beer and bread, Potatoes and superfluous meat. His chins are several. Near his eyesâ How dulled!âa fleshly rampart lies, And round his neck he wears a ridge Attractive to the midge. But, bless my soul! How well he used to bowlâ First medium-pace, then very slowâ For Mother England half a life ago! 2 Bath-chaired, he grumbles when the wind Is warm, and when the wind is cold, And sourly scans each yard of road In search of brat or pup to scold. It vexes him to watch me dare The motors in the market-square, Because he knows that he was none When I was half-past one. But, bless my heart! How well he played his part In shires that roared to see him flog The ball as though a disobedient dog! 3 He's physic-mad. Beside his bed Two dozen threatening bottles stand, With embrocation for his ribs And ointment for his swollen hand. He's happy when he telephones To call the doctor to his bones, Or when the coldly artful nurse Considers he is worse. But, bless my soul! What lightning he could bowl When Bonnor did his best to shock The constitution of the Oval clock! 4 A Blenheim Orange, kept too long, Grows shrivelled, as the skin has grown Of him whose bent and withered form Is loved wherever it is known. This is the Star that used to blaze At Cover-Point! Now length of days Permits him but to toss a mild Half-volley to a child. But, bless my heart! The quivering poise! the dart! The wristy, magical, and stern Completeness of that punishing Return! CLASSIC Look at him! Six feet one, Nervously taut, Aching to do All that he ought. Look at him! Flannelled fire Burning the loud Ranks of a great Cricketing crowd. Look at him! Fathered well, Driven by blood Redder than Time Lent to a Studd. Look at him! Never a lad History knows Ran as he runs, Threw as he throws. URGENT (April, 1926) Jupiter Pluvius, icy pelter Scattering cricketers helter-skelter, Have you the niggardly heart to damp Athletic England's national gamp? Preserve from hail and flying fire That spread of turf in the midland shire Honoured to-day above the rest As the favoured field of the Opening Test. Jupiter Pluvius, can you wonder Collins and Carr are weary of thunder? Sad will it be if a Team that comes Twelve thousand miles shall twiddle its thumbs Instead of fronting noble Fate In league with umpires, turf, and Tate; Burning to dare the changeable odds Of a flannelled war with our demi-gods. Jupiter Pluvius, cloudy master, Patron of ducks and damp disaster, Little we beg but a sterling proof Of heroes under a radiant roof! Permit the sun to show his flame Amid such blue as the Foremost Game Rightly needs when the Southern Cross And the Star of England settle the Toss! Jupiter Pluvius, icy pelter Scattering cricketers helter-skelter, Buckets of rain were never meant To spoil this fight at the Bridge of Trent. Withhold for less imperial days The talkative thunder! Golden rays, Freckles, and puggarees are best When the Two-and-Twenty tackle the Test! A STRIKE (April, 1926) While at Chequers in the Chilterns, Or in Downing's famous street, Ministerial brains are solving Crisis with the help of peat, Let me join the thousands careless In respect of coke and coal, Having paid to watch Eleven Plus Eleven bat and bowl: Twenty-two heroic Strikers, Off the Dole! Warmed by beams as truly brilliant As the flood of light that shone When the god in love with Leda Floated falsely like a swan, May the air be quick with freckles For the faces round the Ring, Bronzing all who watch Elevens Fit for Homer's self to sing: Twenty-two determined Strikers, Each a King! Since the pads are buckled neatly On the nimble legs of Hobbs, No one cares a tinker's byword For the Statesman and his jobs. Who has time for Men and Owners Busy with their Ifs and Buts Ending in a sudden shortage Of convenient baker's nuts, Now that Two-and-Twenty offer Hooks and Cuts? Bored by Capital and Labour, Conference, snarling, venom, tricks, England gaily thumps the Crisis Over Cover-Point for Six! Though at Chequers Stanley Baldwin's Leg-before again to Coal, Here, in Nottingham, the Captains Toss a florin, bat or bowl: Two imperialistic Strikers, Off the Dole! THE LINER With a frank and flannelled load She is cruising by a road That is green and grey and white Till the stars refuse the night. Lean and brown ambassadors, Charged with Sixes, Fives, and Fours, Fret to think of holiday Shadowed by a long delay. Won't you swim on guard beside them, Daddy Neptune, All the way? She is grinding on her breast Hills of ocean, crest by crest, Fearful neither of the flash Shot by lightning nor the crash Dear to Thunder when his proud Hurly-burly daunts the cloud Hanging livid half a day Over furious flights of spray. Dare the trough and sprint beside her, Daddy Neptune, All the way! What if bars of southern gold Quiver in the cumbered hold? What if opals wait to keep London Loveliness from sleep? Heroes, trained for what is worth All the shining stones on earth, Dream of English grass in May Swept and rolled for holiday. Condescend to float beside them, Daddy Neptune, All the way! THORNS I was foolish to be sitting, In the hope of lusty hitting, While a pair of dally-dillersâ Hard at work as Cricket-killersâ Crept along from Ten to Twenty Though receiving there in plenty Just the stuff that gives a Smiter Heart to be the Ring's Delighter. I was foolish to be willing Thus to sacrifice a shilling For a dozen jerky dozes While a Battle of the Roses, With its dreary set of Singles, And its total lack of tingles, Made me dream of mothers sitting In a garden at their knitting. UNLIMITED Parochial minds are prone to think This earth of ours the only planet Allowed to carry on its crust Some creatures made of fire and dust To woman it and man it; But I, for one, am bold enough To urge that Wisdom did not mean us Alone to practise flannelled sport. Perhaps a Test is being fought This very day on Venus. I won't believe that any world Resembling ours in age and pattern Is short of swift and sinewy lads, Although I grant that Cricket pads Have not appeared on Saturn. Undoubtedly, when Time has cooled The pitches there, developed rollers, Designed the crease and ball (and gnats), Those playing-fields will swarm with Bats To thump Saturnian bowlers. When Summer blesses, each in turn, The Martian hemispheres, and urges The Gloved and Padded so to smite That thousands bubble with delight Around the grassy verges, Be positive their sport is not Far other than the game we started Where lads ran clumsily to joy In ploughland boots and corduroy, Big-shouldered, Cricket-hearted! How many Hambledons aloft Revolve around their suns in glory With ancient memories that mix The firstborn Wide, Half-Volley, Six, And Wrangle in their story! The spark of Cricket had to glow On various worlds, with breath to fan it, Before our Daisy-Cutters, Lobs, And Rearers met the earliest Hobbs That ever graced our planet. THE TEASER Larry had lingered at the Nets Instead of gathering violets Along a stream with Rose. Next morning, near a draper's shop, A war began. She wouldn't stop From turning up her nose. He rashly stated that the dress A model wore was loveliness In perfect tune with hers, She sniffed, and told him she was tired Of any costume he admired, And any set of furs. Remembering she had vowed to wear, For love of him, the mass of hair That burnt upon her nape, And yet had sacrificed the bunch Between a breakfast and a lunch, And boasted of the rape, He questioned, âWhat's the usual thing To do with an engagement ring When love has gone? Decide. To build a marriage on pretence Would show a lack of commonsense In bridegroom and in bride.â Then Rose sent down a Teaser. This Was frowning, dimple, sob, and kiss So perfectly controlled That pace and length and spin unnerved The flurried Bat. The Teaser swerved, And Larry's heart was bowled. REMEMBERED This is a Rhyme Of Once-upon-a-Time. My father would have humbled me Across his too-familiar knee If I had given my vote for Tea, That fluid bane of Cricket. A creamed and sugared afternoon, With woman's saucer, cup, and spoon, Meant tragedy; and meant it soon For England's perfect pastime! No golden lads, quoth he, would shrink From leather-worship thus, and slink Pavilion-ward, like cats, to drink The parlour's feeble potion; Nor yet, if warm with proper flame, Would dare to add, becoming tame, A single cushion to the game Inherited from Glory. I bid you keep it bright and stern, That, when your veins no longer burn With blood sufficient, you may turn In honour from the creases, And, represented by a son On fire to do as you have done, May love the Game till Death has won At last your broken wicket. This is a Rhyme Of Once-upon-a-Time. THE OPENING PAIR Snowdrop, whiter than a pad, Crocus, yellower than a bat, What a big first-wicket stand, On a yard of lumpy land, You are making! Bowler Wet And Bowlers Ice and Snow you fret, Remaining set Yet. Snowdrop, turning rather brown, Crocus, wearily fallen flat, What a fine example you, On a wicket far from true, Gave to mortals! None of us Is moved by quiet impetus And lack of fuss Thus. THE BALL What punishment it suffers, Even from duffers! How many millions Have seen it punch pavilions, Saluted by the choral Remonstrances of floral Young Venuses in fixes Because of dropping Sixes! If, bent on Constantining, The Western Wizard pounces With all his sinewy ounces Upon the welcome folly Of a superfine half-volley, How furiously it fizzes On its errand while it whizzes As a ray for Prince and coster From the dazzling Star of Gloucester! How often in the glory Of the freckling sun a story, Fit to live in Wisden's pages Through a century of Ages, Telegraphs to sons and Paters, Earls, policemen, Dukes, and waiters, Curate, poet, busman, shunter, (Blending all the grades and driving Pulses to a jig!) the thriving Figures gathered by the pliant Muscle of a Cricket giant Mingling power and pluck and passion In the right athletic fashion! What punishment it suffers, Even from duffers! How many millions Have seen it jump pavilions! Discarded hats, expressing A sort of general blessing, Salute in noble weather The bird of crimson leather That, roosting for a second On a balustrade, is reckoned Six for him whose muscle gave it Flight and force enough to save it From appearing as a Fourer In the bible of the Scorer. It is good to spend a sunny Afternoonâfor little moneyâ While the fielding is a wonder Greeted by the public thunder; Good to watch so brave a spender Of his pith as Percy Fender Flogging, in a feverish hurry, Boundaries for the sake of Surrey; Good to watch the heroes reaping Records fit for Wisden's keeping, Wellnigh holy, in the pages Vivid with the various stages Used by England till she rounded Cricket to a joy, and founded What, though generations perish, Other broods shall run to cherish Just as long as Time assures them Breath, and merrily endures them! TESTING Under my feet Middlesex turf Warm in the heat; Over my head Measureless blue Perfectly spread. What of the Toss? Whose is the gain, Whose is the loss? Many a hat Signals aloft: England to bat! True to the clock, Southerners, come Forth in a flock! Now, on the best Pitch in the world, Open the Test! Berry-brown, lean, Swift as a buck, Startle the Green! First with the Ball, Then with the Bat, Fever us all! Under the high Acres of blue Hot in the sky Gallop, you fit Sons of the Star Hambledon lit! Victory's sweet. Yet if you crush Lord's with defeat, Then will you hear How, in the gloom, England can cheer! TIT FOR TAT When I was small My Father began, With the help of a ball, To make me a man. When I was tall And broad I was glad, With the help of a ball, To keep him a lad. WHY? Why think a drop or two of rain will hurt Your cricket shirt? Why haste so soon to scatter in affright From dirty light? Why do to me what I should never do, My lads, to you? Why work so hard to make, by plod, plod, plod, The Ringside nod? Why, being padded, scratch about like pens Of languid hens? Why bury, rather than restore to fame, Britannia's Game? HEYDAY I lift my cap to Veteran Time, Who let me live throughout the years When lordly batsmen cut and drove, Surrounded by a ring of cheers! My youth was mellowed in the sun Of giants never equalled since, As Clement Hill, the classic Gunn, The Cambridge-Sussex-Indian Prince. How often, when the last became A ruthless tyrant, and controlled, At heavy cost, whatever ball The flabbergasted bowler bowled, I felt my cricket-driven blood Make legs and arms and shoulders tense, Excited by the hammering thud Of leather on the boundary fence! Imperial cricket lived with us When Ranjitsinhji, swift and slim, Defended England at the crease And Victor Trumper countered him. Their single hope, their single quest, Was room in Cricket's Book of Gold, And he that saw their brilliant best Is finely paid for being old. I touch my cap to Veteran Time, Who gave me those electric years When glittering demi-gods provoked Volleys of superhuman cheers. 'Twas then I mellowed in the sun Of batsmen never equalled since: The Southland Pride, the Greatest Gunn, The Cambridge-Sussex-Indian Prince! AN OVER OF DAYS Considered as the last six balls bowled to one of my friends by Captain Death. Monday's shook him, but he blocked it. Tuesday's reared. The Batsman cocked it Safely past the Bowler's hand Otherwise than thought had planned. Wednesday's was a Yorker, thrust Outward in a drift of dust. Thursday's nicked the off-side bail In its narrow groove of metal, While the Veteranâstaggering, paleâ Watched it lift, fall back, and settle. Friday's, rushing like a boulder Down a mountain, struck his bat Fiercely on a pointed shoulder; Sprang aloft to split his cheekbone Like an eggshell; knocked him flat! Beaten? Though divorced from mind, Groped the twitching hands to find What had fallen there. He touched it; Laughed a conqueror's laugh; and clutched it. Followed Saturday's astounding Break-backâmeteor-swift, confounding Vision, pith, and nerve, and grounding Two stumps out of three. No wonder Death himself swayed panting under Sudden gloom! A big-boned giant, Long courageous, long defiant, Sprawled (as loosely as the wicket) Deaf to Umpire, dead to Cricket! THE FAVOURITE Reward me well! I often brown Your solemn face with oil in winter, Preparing you to help our Town Annex the Silver Cup. Don't splinter! Have faith in me, as I in you, And let us boldly front together What pith and enterprise can do Against us both with crimson leather. Reward me well! Weapon of worth! What times are these When brain and wood, with splice and muscle, Support the wholesome rivalries Of Cricket's merry-mannered tussle! Accept ere long your native shire's Commending roar, and give my sinew The loyal service it requires From every ounce of merit in you, Weapon of worth! Giver of joy! The year will come When youâa treasure often carried At evenfall triumphant home From bowlers duly dared and parriedâ Must fail the Ring. Yet you and I, As snowbound fancy often chooses, Upon our hearthrug will defy The Leg-Break Merchant and his ruses, Giver of joy! PAX BRITANNICA âRound the world,â quoth Captain Cricket, âIsn't very far to travel! What are four-and-twenty thousand Miles of water, rock, and gravel? Having seen my art and patience In respect of various Corkers, Trust me, Lad, when Father Ocean Slings me down his thundering Yorkers! âBe there eight-and-forty thousand Miles of furious foam for crossing, Sinewy Bats and brainy Bowlers Can't be countered by a tossing. Just so long as foreign Peoples Call for willow-wood and leather, Englishmen shall laugh at Neptune While he brews infernal weather. âWould you have, in distant regions, Furioso change to largo, Add the implements of Cricket Promptly to a steamer's cargo! Let us ship evangelizing Umpire, Bowler, Batsman, Scorer Far from home, to prove the friendship Active in the flying Fourer! âThis will be a perfect planet Only when the Game shall enter Every country, teaching millions How to ask for Leg or Centre. Closely heed a level-headed Sportsman far too grave to banter: When the cricket-bags are opened, Doves of Peace fly forth instanter!â NAN No likenesses of poets stand Among the knick-knacks in her room; No hairy fiddler in a frame Presents his late or early bloom. Two Californian Stars of Film Are featured on the mantelpiece, Together with a statuette From either Italy or Greece. Upon a table, near a pot Of aromatic somethingness, A Wilfred, who is also Rhodes, Is dapper in civilian dress; And close beside a metal group Of pigeons, geese, and various dogs Her heroâHerbert Sutcliffeâsmiles His Century-smile in cricket togs. She, Yorkshire born and Yorkshire bred, Must feed on joy or suffer bane When rival Roses take the field In narky mood at Bramall Lane. Her colour then is quick to tell How many tints her flesh can wear, And when a Six goes soaring by She flushes to her throat and hair If Herbert gives the brawny men Of Lancashire but little rest, This girl is happier than a thrush With children underneath her breast; But should the tragic oval squat Behind his number on the Board Her patriotic eyes confuse The figures of the total scored. When Nan goes home at evenfall And limply blunders to a seat, Her mother and her sisters know Their shire is threatened with defeat. How should a dish of scrambled eggs Relieve her gloom? Since hope has fled Beyond a muffin's help, she takes Her bruise and shattered pride to bed. A POINT OF VIEW Prophets are thick in England now. They swear, Some in delight, and some in scarlet passion, That hunting of the fox must finish where This sport has been so long a furious fashion. Conceivably. The wolf in time withdrew; the boar, Bedecked in rosemary, escaped from dishes; And if the bullied fox is run no more, Good Luck will grant another of my wishes. Prophets of genuine evil can be found Whose prevalence of bile attacks the hoary And signal services on many a ground Of Cricket resonant in flannelled glory. This is the hour of artificial hares Bamboozling dogs; of cometary Scourges Adroit at roaring round the Dirt Track flares Amid a mob that bets and bawls and surges. This is the age of cruisers in the sky, Of speed gone mad, of funerals in a hurry. See to it, then, that none of us shall die Of tedium, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Surrey! Has County Cricket, as the prophets tell, Only a decade left in which to dwindle From vivid splendour such as used to swell The veins and cause a multitude to kindle? Forbid it, Heaven! Yet, in this age of speed, A crucial slowness, not unlike Stonehenge's, Is but a plan for tempting Time to breed A brat or two by way of dark revenges. LONG AGO Many, many times I went Along the leafy lanes of Kent, Driving with a sunburnt set Of clubmates in a wagonette. Yellowhammers used to dip Loopingly ahead and slip Fast toward a cool recess Of honeysuckle's loveliness, Long, long ago. How it pleasured me to sit And learn my England, bit by bit; Trying not to nurse the thought Of, later, getting out for nought! Runs were riches then, and meant, After broody discontent, Hopes and promises of flame To sparkle in the Foremost Game, Long, long ago. Looking back, I note the green Alive with those that long have been Shadows of the village set Of partners in a wagonette. Memory, warming, now re-tells Stolen runs. A million cells, Murmuring cricket in my brain, Agree to publish once again Long, long ago. Homeward many times I wentâ A moody boyâby lanes in Kent, Bidding Fancy flog the ball That bowled me to the boundary wall. Yet, when yellowhammers flung Plumage to the air and swung, Quick of passage, out of sight, The sour turned sweet, the dark grew bright, Long, long ago. TWO FOR GAME A human eagle, Feathered white, Swoops past the palings on the right. A bounce! A pounce! His every ounce Fiercely rapacious in our sight! A crimson Fury Near the stand Batters in vain the dauntless hand. A swerve! A curve! His every nerve Hustles the leather homeward. Grand! Again it rushes, Swift and high, Heedless of roar and groan and sigh. A snatch! A catch! A noble match Loved and remembered till I die! âPATSYâ Now that April's dead and gone, May is here to spend her weeks Warming grasses, fattening buds, Spreading brown on pinky cheeks. Since to lilac-time at Lord's Flowery cricket has been added, Middlesex again presents (With customary compliments) Hendren gloved and padded. Business-like and broad he comes Down the famous steps, to bring Volleys of regard and trust, Many-throated from the Ring. Schoolboys worship, maids admire, Clicking cameras snap his bearing. Thus his Londoners address (With customary thoroughness) Hendren dark and daring. Merry round that spread of turf Sit the ringside devotees, Under heaven of Oxford blue, Murmuring as ten million bees. Since to lilac-time at Lord's Comrade Cricket now is added, Middlesex in joy presents (With customary compliments) Hendren gloved and padded. THE PROTEST Since even Virtue could at times Depart from what alone was fitting, And sneer at Cautionary Rhymes In praise of hymnal and of knitting, We scarcely wonder when we note Disfigurements by age allotted To that on which we mean to doat, However badly blotted. The sun himself, perhaps in sport, Allows his planetary creatures By smoky glass to view a wart Or two upon his handsome features; And Cricket, our athletic sun, Is faulted by alarming patches Of blisters due to what is done To-day in County matches. Conspicuous in the list of fads, Developed till they rank as vices, Are legging balls with super-pads And sitting doggedly on splices. Such Bats as dim the Cricket Star Supplied with flame by Thornton, Hayward, And Victor Trumper, seem, and are, Objectionally wayward. Macartney of the Southland lives To sparkle as the Drive's supporter. With pen and spoken words he gives The killers of the Game no quarter. A pastime that was brought to birth In England by heroic hitters, And travelled sinewy round the earth, Can spare deflecting Sitters. TO A FAMOUS FIRM Don't imagine I resent Bitter lessons taught me, Messrs Frost and Ice &amp; Co., When you roughly fought me Through the saplings, up the hill, Over sodden heather, Hour by hour with Kinderscout's Double-fisted weather. Don't imagine I resent Drifted fury seen on Cutting Corner, where I met Wind enough to lean on! When the Christmas berries burn Lamp-like on the hollies Out I stagger, proud to front Hail in slanting volleys! Still, I savagely resent Polar sleet in May-time Just as much as farmers loathe Deluges in hay-time. When I hear romantic birds Billing in a thicket Then I hum the flats and sharps Modulating Cricket. Countless lads of Flanneldom, Winter-weary, aching, Hurry crease-ward, there to score Totals worth the making. Messrs Frost and Ice &amp; Co., Think it shame to banish Centuries from England! Budge! Can't you hear me? Vanish! SERVICE All I can do now Is to teach the Little Ones how A cricketer stands, The bat in his hands, Fronting a short or tall Man with a ball. A nephew is one; And my neighbour's slip of a son Is glad to be taught To play as he ought, Flogging his Ones and Twos, Bearing his bruise. With enough of time, I can drill these lads for their prime. Imagine a Studdâ A Jessopâin bud! Ponder the infant blobs Leading to Hobbs! All I can do now Is to teach the Little Ones how. Because I am old, And easily bowled, Captains to-day decline Help such as mine. FAREWELL Read in my book. If you think I am wrong There to chastise any lapse from the splendid Glow of the Game in my youth, I unfold Proudly the Flag that my Father defended. Read in my book. If unkindness were meant, Now, on this ultimate page, I should falter. Softness and slowness are evils. My verse Carries no phrase that the Verseman will alter. Read in my book. Try to learn how I love Cricket, the masterful agent for fusing, Year after year, all the citizen grades England has used, and will use, and is using.</field>
