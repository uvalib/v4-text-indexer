[The Two Soldiers] I love to hear a summer tale When all the fields are green When sheep are grazing hill &amp; dale &amp; villagers are seen On sundays taking pleasant walks Through corn &amp; grass &amp; hay &amp; maidens lost in laughing talk Along their milking way Oft bending by a stile to look At wild flowers in the sun Or leaning by a gravel brook To see the waters run Where wood bines arch &amp; wilding rose In leaning posture stands They fearing oft to soil their cloaths Sip water from their hands When shepherds talk the sun to bed By awthorn shaded brooks In storys that were never read In any printed books &amp; Goody who from maidenhood Had traced the summer vales No doubt had taste turned out as good Knew many better tales But darkness &amp; the hasty rain &amp; noisy roaring wind Brought like an ancient song again The story to her mind The night was dismal dark the rain Fell with the falling leaves &amp; patted at the window pane &amp; rattled from the eaves The cottage fire was blazing bright The kitling full of mirth Sat crouching in the corner light For crickets on the [h]earth &amp; circling round a merry group Sat listening to the rain Till goody lapt her knitting up To tell a tale again She told about an ancient hall That stood so very lone She mentioned ivy on the wall In terrors undertone The very thought it checkt her breath Lone midnight on the moores For furze that blossom on the heath Grew almost to the doors &amp; woods that tempests seldom miss That raves &amp; howls &amp; roars To scare on such a night as this The gard dog out of doors To say twas true she couldnt stop But almost could declare Whoso looked up the chimney top Would see the branches there The gentleman who owned the hall On travel far away Left servant folks in number small To guard it night &amp; day The girls by custom like to men Nigh overcome their fears Till winds blew loud at night &amp; then They'd try to stop their ears Though doors where safe &amp; locks where strong When watch dogs barked about They dare not speak nor sing a song But put the candles out One dark &amp; drear december night One just got up to look &amp; lit another candle light To fetch a pleasant book For there was many books indeed To sweeten solitude &amp; they would very often read When in a reading mood For all the neighbours dwelling near Where those upon the shelves The servant men in spite of fear Oft left them to themselves She stopt awhile the fire to stir &amp; put an apple down To roast—&amp; muttered as to her She'd never leave a town The maid just got into a chair To look the volume oer But ere she found a story there A rap was at the door She hurried out &amp; dropt the light Her heart was dropping too Both in a corner crushed out right &amp; knew not what to do A voice called out that they had lost The way &amp; meant no ill &amp; so the maidens hoped at most For every dog was still Two soldiers they had left the road While crossing heath &amp; more &amp; one had brothers gone abroad So she unlocked the door Now goody let the story stop A minute in her mind While louder in the chimney top &amp; louder got the wind She said what many may have said In such a night what joy To have a house above their heads To keep them warm &amp; dry The apples leisure to regale Were roasted to the core So from their patience &amp; her tale She stole a minute more Soldiers though men of guns &amp; swords Know kindliness as well &amp; have a mort of tender words That suit the women well They pardon craved for knocking there By travel sore distrest The maids in pity set the chairs An hour or two to rest They talked so honest to the maids Both hoped them honest men Nay one was not a bit affraid &amp; felt no terror then For she'd a brother far from home That wouldn't hurt a flye The other wished the dogs would come To show a guard was nigh She dare not let her courage fail Or let them understand Her fears so when her cheek turned pale She leaned upon her hand The soldiers talked of foreign parts Till coming from without A whistle made the maidens start &amp; then they heard a shout Then somthing trampled near the place &amp; voices muttered near They looked up in each others face &amp; dare not speak for fear Then louder still as in the room &amp; horses on the moor They heard &amp; thought the master come Yet terror barred the door Twas well they did let who would come The latch was gently tried The maidens hallooed Tom the Groom But ne'er a voice replied Yet such a noise &amp; such a shock More loud then danger calls Gave at the door a thundering knock So loud it shook the walls Who knocked one said &amp; all looked up In goodys face for dread &amp; had a owl began to whoop They'd all been drove to bed Who knocked that granny could not show So fear out mastered mirth The old man in the moon might know But none could tell on earth &amp; many noises went &amp; came &amp; both the soldiers then Showed they were free from doubting blame &amp; down right honest men They heard the maidens tales of doubt &amp; bade them both be still &amp; listened at the noise without Yet feared for nothing ill For they had met all sorts of fear That like the clouds in may Lost all their dread in coming near &amp; grew from black to grey They h[e]ard but never cared to quake &amp; knew no reason why Noises the winds could never make Although the winds was high &amp; just to drive the noises back That round the house begun They reached it from the kitchen rack &amp; charged the rusty gun Then gently threw the window up To get the muzzle through &amp; kneeling heard another whoop &amp; then a whistle blew They listened wether light or dark If thieves were on the spot They would be near enough the mark To fright em so they shot A sound as somthing shot again A groan &amp; somthing fell But still they feared the cow was slain What else they couldnt tell &amp; yet the noises came &amp; went &amp; steps at every door Traced round the house for some intent They knew &amp; nothing more When morning did the sparrows send To chelp the news of day Twas like a letter from a friend Or sweetheart far away Glad as a present from abroad From friendship that had crost The sea in ships when all on board In some old news was lost The maids from windows round the hall Looked out both far &amp; near The grape leaves shivered by the wall As if they quaked for fear But nothing could they hear or see &amp; yet so frit they was They sturted backwards when the bee Came buzz agen the glass &amp; soon as light gave leave to see In garden ground &amp; shed The soldiers searched to ease &amp; free The maids of every dread Yet in the gravel by the door Fresh places might be seen The foot marks plain where one or more Had on some errand been Where sluthering footsteps slipt aside Ridged up the gravel lay As some had struggled &amp; had tried To stand or get away &amp; there a spot of blood appeared Where somthing seemed to fall &amp; sure enough twas known &amp; feared Thieves meant to rob the hall The listeners round where glad at heart &amp; goody felt delight That soldiers took the maidens part &amp; found the hall that night But granny where was Tom the Groom A little urchin said Who chased the kitling round the room With dancing cork &amp; thread That Goodys story couldnt show But guessed he ran away His sweetheart in the town below Wept for him many a day The soldiers they had met with scars As soldiers mostly do &amp; they had been in morts of wars Twas all that goody knew But still the story went to say (Maids should love honest men) That though they forced to go away They both returned agen The Memory of Love A Tale Once in the merry toil of clipping time When suns are hot &amp; summers in her prime An old man laboring with his fellow men Neath two broad wallnuts shadowing oer the pen To lighten labour &amp; make short the day They tund old songs &amp; chatterd time away Some bragging oer the feats of younger years Of quickness some to use the snipping sheers Others of strength &amp; agilty the while When they could leap a ditch or jump a stile One told the history of his dog with pride That half asleep lay panting by his side The young ones harpd of coming holidays &amp; pretty maids &amp; dances had their praise Of those they sought &amp; fools that had believd &amp; dreamd of marriage till they woke decievd Twas thought no sin if hearts they only won To make them ach they thought it precious fun Old robin heard em tween a sigh &amp; smile &amp; bade them listen to his tale awhile They stopt &amp; choakd the titter as he spoke &amp; heard his story as one hears a joke Thinking him childish as his mind woud cling Wi joy to such a silly seeming thing The vulgar dregs of love was all they knew But what hed felt was tender puer &amp; true “My boys” says he “I once was young &amp; wild “Urging my follys when a maiden smild “Oft whispering marriage wi a foolish tongue “&amp; then excusd me as some years too young “I courted beauty till the freak was past “&amp; then found others prettier then the last “I wood &amp; won them as a sort of pride “&amp; then sought others till I was denied “Nor coud their sighs affect my roving will “I left them off in search of prettier still “Laugh not my boys when slighted maidens mourn “For fear your follys may be servd in turn “&amp; if in beautys net ye once shoud be “Yell find a puzzle ere your hearts are free “I left my old place wi the finishd year “&amp; went to service in a village near “Stretchd from the last but some few country miles “In crooked pathways over dykes &amp; styles “Were foolish freaks my fancys did renew “&amp; folly sweetend as each face was new “But there one beauty met my wandering eye “&amp; bound my fancys wi a troubld tye “I tryd to break it but it woud not bend “So freaks &amp; lyes &amp; follys had their end “Her very image startles on me yet “She seemd the lovliest I had ever met “Her face chilld thro me tho twas only fair “&amp; red &amp; rosey as a manys are “&amp; tho her bosom swelld &amp; eyes shone bright “As others shine they overpowerd me quite “In every feature shone that witching spell “That love adores &amp; language cannot tell “To my new place I went at michaelmass “When roads were splashy but green leaves &amp; grass “Brought this sweet blossom wi the early may “To win the wandering of my heart away “Hird at a mayday statute &amp; her name “Was talk about the village ere she came “Maids jealous whisperings did their doubtings raise “While chaps was eager tho by guess to praise “&amp; I who meant a seasons suit to prove “Met wi a fruitless &amp; a lasting love “The day she came I reccolect it still “As wi a cart I journeyd to the mill “She passd me by her face I cant forget “The sweetest may flower I had ever met “The morn was lovly &amp; down lane &amp; balk “I went in joy &amp; musd along the walk “Gazing on prospects in a happy vein “Oer fields fresh ploughd &amp; springing crops of grain “&amp; all I met &amp; all that pleasd my eye “Time neer had power to push their memory bye “I still remember how each close was lind “Wi cowslip bunches nodding in the wind “&amp; in each lane oer hung wi briar &amp; thorn “What swarms of daiseys glitterd in the morn “My dog was happy too &amp; often rolld “His curly jacket in the fresh ploughd mold “&amp; sheep that woud my dog a moment heed “Rose from their lares &amp; stoopd adown to feed “The hare oft sturted from the clover lea “&amp; birds were happy as a song can be “The red caps often from the hedge woud drop “&amp; whistling perch upon the thistle top “The weeders toild &amp; sung their hours away “&amp; while the old ones askd the time of day “The young girls hallood merrily &amp; shill “If I woud take a partner to the mill “Nor did I think a heart as glad as theirs “Woud meet a cause to change my joy to cares “The roaring mill brook whose uneven tide “Grows now &amp; then more then a horse can stride “Till from the mill releasd its windings creep “Narrow &amp; soft a green grass hoppers leap “She passd me there I turnd an anxious eye “&amp; had one askd I coud not answer why “Twas her I thought that wore the village fame “&amp; ere I judg'd it provd the very same “She askd the way &amp; wi a timid smile “Turnd back to thank me ere she skipt the stile “I wishd Id offerd help when she was bye “To cross the brook but it was nearly dry “Nor on the bank she sighd to be alone “Nor pausd before she stept from stone to stone “Filld full of fancys to my journeys end “I wishd Id spoke then judgd I might offend “Then wishd the brook its stones had over run “&amp; stretchd a danger which she coud not shun “Without my help that I by chance might prove “A feeble shadow of my sudden love “Within the foldings of her ankerchief “Was pind a red pink wi its crimson leaf “The little trifle gave my bosom pain “I thought it given by some parting swain “&amp; ever since my memory keeps awake “To love the blossom for the owners sake “&amp; every year as clipping time comes round “When ere I see one in our poseys bound “Tho I am old &amp; love has lost its power “I pause &amp; sigh &amp; een coud kiss the flower “&amp; think the maiden be she plain or fair “Like her I lovd because she placd it there “I often went on sundays to the spot “Were she passd by a trifle neer forgot “The very stones she stept to cross the stream “Ive sat for hours to muse upon &amp; dream “The stile too over which I saw her climb “Has made my foolish heart ach many a time “&amp; tho Im old my palsid memory still “If I passd now woud turn my bosom chill “On the next morning as I crossd the plain “At milkings hour I saw the maid again “The cows stood round her in a wondering way “&amp; being a stranger kept her fears at bay “They tossd their heads &amp; snufft the morning gales “&amp; skewd at her—I gladly took the pails “&amp; tho my sheep that almost seemd to scold “Me when I went was noising in the fold “I milkd em all &amp; more her fears to screen “I took her yokes &amp; saw her oer the green “&amp; at the pasture gate wi fond delight “I left a promise I woud milk at night “&amp; urgd her kind return that shed agree “My may game partner at the eve to be “She lookd consent I even thought she smild “For love sees double when by hope beguild “But as the cows grew reconsild &amp; tame “She always thankd me but refusd the claim “To milk or bear it home from evens toil “&amp; een refusd assistance oer a stile “It made me half my hopful love resign “&amp; feel her heart had but small room for mine “Yet I urgd on &amp; woud my doubts reprove “&amp; often thought she desbeleevd my love “I went to church each leisure sabbath day “For every purpose but the right to pray “Her seat was opposite to mine—in vain “I tryd to read &amp; turnd to gaze again “Till some old woman shook her serious head “&amp; urgd my eye to what I seldom read “My book was open oft when prayers were done “&amp; Ive kept reading till the psalms begun “When the clerks voice &amp; basoon booming deep “Made memory startle as Id been asleep “I often tryd what signals love woud take “But she seemd strange to all I had to make “I often smild when ere she turnd her eye “But she woud pause as if she wonderd why “She seemd to try to shun me in the street “&amp; I scarce consious tryd the maid to meet “At length some gipseys on our comon came “&amp; as a change to may nights even game “Maids in the gipseys nook proposd a dance “&amp; I went too &amp; dreamd upon the chance “For summer eves to servants then supplyd “Sweet leisure hours when toil was thrown aside “Masters &amp; misses too woud join the play “&amp; ramp as equals in the sports of may “In my young days soon as the ruddy sun “Was set our labour in the fields was done “&amp; we have playd &amp; dancd when day was bye “Till the moons horns crept half way up the sky “Young miss &amp; master servant man &amp; maid “&amp; none woud scold nor question why we staid “The maiden came her whom I wished to see “I askd her trembling if shed dance with me “She smild then checkt it &amp; wi half turnd eye “Pausd for a moment ere she made reply “Good manners seemd to urge her to consent “She blushd &amp; yielded &amp; away we went “O the first time I touchd her gentle hand “I felt a joy yell never understand “Unless ye chill neath true loves extacy “&amp; then yell own the pleasant pain wi me “My heart sunk in me like a lump of clay “My feet een trembld as we dancd away “&amp; then the trembling left me &amp; in turn “Hot feverish flushes made it seem to burn “I viewd her face were beauty near coud cloy “&amp; dreamd oer raptures till I smild for joy “Some sneerd contempt &amp; whisperingly abusd “&amp; others turnd away &amp; seemd confusd “To see me chuse a stranger from the throng “&amp; shun the partners I had known so long “I prest her hand she turnd a tender eye “But never smild &amp; often seemd to sigh “&amp; when a finish to the sports had come “I offerd hints to see her safly home “She turnd aside &amp; never answerd no “But thankd me kindly &amp; prepard to go “&amp; warm wi raptures dreams in hopes delay “I led her homward on our evening way “&amp; venturd gradual hints &amp; smiles &amp; sighs “To clear my passion of its thin disguise “She seemd confusd at what she had to say “Nor bade hopes live nor wishd my words away “At length she tryd &amp; when she choakd the sigh “She gave me hints that made them hurry bye “‘Nay you may love’ she said ‘&amp; Id believe “If I had power but why shoud I decieve’ “Then pausd as loath the finish to relate “&amp; woud have left me but I held the gate “She sighd to see me toy wi hopes &amp; fears “&amp; made excuses to conseal her tears “Wiping her dark brown curls from either eye “As shrinking from me she exclaimd ‘good bye’ “&amp; bade me cease to say she had my heart “&amp; struggld from me as resolvd to part “‘Your hearts not mine’ she said ‘&amp; I must shun “Your urgd returns for mines already won “What ever proofs your vows or words make known “I cannot give you what is not my own’ “Then loosd the gate &amp; hurried to the door “&amp; I beheld her wi hopes eyes no more “For often to the town her lover came “&amp; came at last the marriage day to name “I went to church not knowing what I did “That very sunday when the bands was bid “Lord help ones cares Id need enough to stay “&amp; think while there of better things &amp; pray “But when the parson brought the thing about “I shut my book &amp; sighd &amp; venturd out “&amp; went I know not how nor were nor when “But hopes wore off &amp; I got better then “The marriage came it was a woful day “&amp; memory gave it an eternal stay “I heard the bells ring as I crossd the moor “&amp; never heard so sad a peal before “I wishd to see how she woud look a bride “&amp; started off &amp; then my courage dyd “I woud not go &amp; then I venturd bye “The church yard wall but nothing met my eye “I felt as happy that the thing was oer “&amp; then as vexd I did not go before “I hung my head half shamd along the street “Nor card to talk wi those my path woud meet “Lest they shoud jeer me or bring up the day “So when they spoke I mumbling sneakd away “I thought upon her lovly face for years “Wi fondest feelings almost kin to tears “Till the heart achd wi love—I cannot tell “What others thought by her I lovd so well “Or how she seemd to him that calld her wife “Her face to me was memory for life “Her looks her ways in winning forms woud steal “&amp; left a pain I never ceasd to feel “Her very voice woud memorys partner be “&amp; music lingerd in the sound wi me “Her troubling form was long about my sight “Oer day dreams dozing or in sleep by night “My dreams wore constantly that pleasing pain “The face of her I lovd &amp; coud not gain “&amp; oft I see that moving scene renewd “&amp; as she passd I seemingly pursued “Somtimes in vain &amp; oft as wide awake “I saw her stop &amp; smile at my mistake “Changd to a face I never saw before “&amp; all my shadows of delight was oer “&amp; wishd that pleasure vainly een in sleep “Were fancy pictures its delusions deep “I wishd when waking I coud feel the bliss “&amp; venturd one imaginary kiss “That seeming pleasure might to memory cling “But even this my dreams woud never bring “I sought at first the noise of feast &amp; fair “To see if tumult yet had joys to spare “&amp; hopes woud somtimes join my pleasant way “Thro fields &amp; meads in summer cloathing gay “Half sad half pleasd I musd oer what might come “&amp; idly brushd the meadow flowers in bloom “&amp; when I saunterd mid the noisey fair “Memory woud taunt me who was wanted there “&amp; oft I strove wi foolish search to find “Some face like hers that I might change my mind “I left on this &amp; that an earnest eye “&amp; made some turn—no doubt to wonder why “But all were blanks &amp; made my wishes vain “&amp; search for cure still added all to pain “The showmans shouts which wonder yearly brings “The huge hung pictures of outlandish things “Were grinning tigers waverd in the wind “&amp; raisd more wonders then was hid behind “The merry fool that woud his speeches make “Till wi the fun my very sides woud ach “The turning organ &amp; the jarring din “Of shouts &amp; music tempting gazers in “Till crowds woud crush around the tempting shows “&amp; I crushd too nor card for trampld toes “The jew cheats veigling voice ‘who bys who bys’ “Wi white washd watches of inspiring size “The rolling drum &amp; soldiers gay cockade “&amp; fond encroachments of some simpering maid “Pulling my sleeve &amp; urging whispers low “Memory of farings promisd long ago “These all unnoticd now I saunterd bye “&amp; only turnd a carless ear or eye “Seeking for that which it was vain to find “To loose the burden from a troubld mind “The dance &amp; revel brought its joys no more “I hated pastimes which I lovd before “The walks on sabbath days wi milking lass “&amp; every pastime on the summer grass “Were hunt the slipper passd the hours away “&amp; blindmens buff made every bosom gay “When tittering maidens urgd me which to seize “These lost the relish &amp; the power to please “&amp; may day revels ownd their powers no more “I sought no may bush for a lovers door “Nor snatchd short sleeps to watch the morn begin “To take her cows the garlands claims to win “I saw none now that claimd an hour from sleep “Nor none to care for but my dog &amp; sheep “I kept no ‘may balls’ now of cowslips made “To toss on maydays to a favourd maid “I ran no ‘crookhorn’ on the pasture grasses “Nor ‘duck neath water’ playd wi bawling lasses “Nor dancd the ‘Maze’ which shepherds fond of play “Cut in the grass to baffle maids at may “The self same puzzle which the knowing boy “Oft draws at school &amp; calls ‘the road to troy’ “Nor ‘lost love letter’ round the whispering ring “Coud one fe[i]nt pleasure to my musings bring “My fancys found none in the merry game “As worth the kisses which the finders claim “I shund them all the sports &amp; loves &amp; ways “That usd to please me in my hopfull days “My sundays harmless pleasures were forsook “Nor turnd my rambles to the pasture brook “Were in my youth at ‘Eastwells’ fountain side “Which winters never froze nor summer dryd “Young men &amp; maidens usd to talk &amp; play “In the cool shadows of its willows grey “Drinking loves healths in totts of sugard drink “On the soft swellings of its rushy brink “From the spring head like winter cold &amp; chill “Were boils the white sand that is never still “Now swimming up in silver threads &amp; then “Slow siling down to bubble up agen “There shepherds usd to sit &amp; tell the while “Their tales &amp; jokes to win each maidens smile “&amp; drank loud flattering healths to those they lovd “&amp; turnd to pause &amp; see if they approvd “The maids lookd down &amp; blushd till none percievd “Then smild a token which their hearts believd “I shund all these which I had lovd before “&amp; joind the childens play games on the moor “Nicking the ‘nine peg morris’ in the grass “Or tying garlands for some little lass “Reaching them roses from the hedgrow bowers “Who fawnd around me till I got the flowers “&amp; turnd my labours to their changing wills “Now willow whistles made then water mills “Then plaited rush caps till they cloyd agen “&amp; fresh inventions were demanded then “Midsummer cushions oft their taste woud court “&amp; mid the green corn off they chasd in sport “&amp; thus I tryd to loiter time away “Till they were weary of each idle play “I was the play king of the jocund clan “&amp; often wishd I coud forget the man “That had but trifles happiness to spoil “Play all their love &amp; all their trouble toil “Somtimes wi stretching hand they bent to look “Flat stones &amp; pebbles in the tinkling brook “Making me jelt them oer the pond to make “The bouncing jumps they title ‘duck &amp; drake’ “&amp; mong the shutting daiseys on its banks “As they grew sick &amp; weary of their pranks “Ive dropt adown at ruddy eventide “&amp; sat to hear them wonder at my side “To see the water imitate the sky “&amp; the round moon miles thro the bottom lye “Were the cloud man true to his evening place “Stood in its light &amp; lookd us in the face “As tho he heard their merry shout &amp; laugh “Leaning like talking shepherd oer his staff “Or weary woodman (&amp; as such they guest “The shade to be) bent oer his load to rest “My partners as they passd woud point &amp; say “Theres love sick robin wi the boys at play “Maidens woud think me justly servd &amp; smild “To see crossd love had made me twice a child “Folks thought me crazd &amp; you may think the same “Who know of love no further then the name “Think as ye please my childish tale is done “Tis time it were for theres the setting sun “&amp; if ye ere shoud meet wi my despair “To love a girl that has no love to spare “Then will your weakness to their beauty bow “&amp; feel the truth that I have told you now” Jockey &amp; Jinney or First Love A Tale “Thoughtless of beauty she was beautys self” Thomson [The Seasons, Autumn l.207] Wereover many a stile neeth willows grey The winding footpath leaves the public way Free from the dusty din &amp; ceasless chime Of bustling waggons in the summer time Crossing a brook—were braving storms in vain Two willows fell &amp; still for brigs remain Corn field &amp; clover closes leading down In peacful windings to the neighbouring town Were on bridge wall or rail or trees smooth bark The passing eye is often stopt to mark The artless vanity of village swains Who spend a leisure hour with patient pains &amp; put to sculptors purposes the knife To spin a cobweb for an after life Nicking the letters of their little names In rudest forms that untaught science frames Pleasd with the feeblest shadow of renown That warms alike the noble and the clown Nigh to that path a sheltering hedge beside A Cottage stands in solitary pride Whose thatch with housleek flowers is yellowd oer Where flock the bees from hives agen the door Lonly &amp; sweet as ever welcome spring Neer fails its pleasant visitors to bring Trees sheltering round it hide returning rooks &amp; twittering swallows seek its chimney nooks In peace the sparrow chirps its joyous calls &amp; takes the feather to the crevisd walls Nor fails the harmless robin &amp; the wren To seek such sweet secluded haunts agen Beneath the eaves the martins still repair &amp; yearly build their mortard dwelling there Here Jinney livd to grace the lovly scenes Fair as the spring sweet blushing in her teens &amp; mid her flowers &amp; linnets wistling nigh Has often met the strangers passing eye Beneath the eldern sitting in the cool Knitting her hoes or winding at her spool The fairest village maid around for miles Mingling by turns her dittys &amp; her smiles Her parents joy she was their hearts to glad Their only hopes for she was all they had Nor once their warmest wishes she decievd She heard their counsels &amp; their truth believd With their advice thro life she journeyd on Nor did a wrong unless to love be one Tho in an humble way her friends livd well &amp; had their butter &amp; their eggs to sell While such like errands fell to Jinneys share Who weekly went to market with her ware Gracfully drest some lovers eye to win For Jinneys bosom felt that harmless sin Nor faild she long tho little done by dress To crown her artless wishes with success Once journ[ey]ing thither Jockey met her view Opening the gate as she was passing thro' She blushd supprise he bended oer his hook &amp; as she left him turnd him round to look Her cheek was rosey for the day was warm Her hat untyd &amp; basket on her arm She felt his look but never turnd agen Shed long been cautiond not to stare at men &amp; as her hand that held with jealous trust Her folded gown from sweeping in the dust Let go with modest fears its hold behind He felt more touchd &amp; blest her in his mind &amp; tho she nimbly glided from his sight Her face &amp; manners left a fixt delight &amp; in his bosom found a lasting place Time nor fresh faces coud no more deface &amp; Jinney felt she knew not hardly how A fluttering somthing never known till now She wonderd what the strangers look coud mean &amp; thought she likd him best of all shed seen Nor coud she help conjecturing on the sight &amp; guessd &amp; guess'd &amp; hopd she guessd the right Shed feign made light of all she thought she knew But thoughts grew stronger as they older grew Nor helpd she wishing in her reasons spite Hed gen be there returning home at night &amp; spite of what her mother said of men Hopd as she passd hed hold the gate agen Meanwhile the swain with mellancholly speed Pursued his toils &amp; drove his flocks to feed Go were he woud his mind was hard to please His heart was wandering &amp; but ill at ease The hat untyd the rosey burning cheek Was with him all the day &amp; all the week Nor woud they leave him while the night sojournd In dreams the teazing pleasures still returnd Jenny the same was often wakd from sleep Wi clapping gates &amp; bleat of droving sheep &amp; startling shepherds every now &amp; then Crossing her path &amp; holding gates agen Each market morning as she passd the place Past reccolections reddend in her face The strangers look rose burning in her mind &amp; made her often turn to look behind While virgin fears in matters yet untryd Woud feign forget it but the heart denyd As when in dreams the stranger shepherd came She seemd to flye &amp; hide her head for shame But soon as woke—the startling vision bye To find 'em dreams she coudnt help but sigh Thus weeks &amp; months wi' Jocky &amp; wi Jane Finishd their rounds &amp; toild em oer again Finding each heart in blindfold hopes the same &amp; leaving heavier every time they came Each felt &amp; wishd what neither dard pursue &amp; each as warmly lovd but neither knew Jockey had known her name ere sin the day He met the maiden on her market way Ere sin he op'd the gate in hopes to please &amp; for his kindness lost his heart &amp; ease By passing folks then made enqu[i]reys good Of whom she was &amp; were her cottage stood &amp; oft essayd to start when doubts delayd &amp; spoilt but every resolution made As reason turnd him round to think awhile Dropt on a hill or leaning oer a stile Judging how vain such follys to pursue To be a fool &amp; thus declare it too By seeking one he never knew before &amp; ask admission at a strangers door Where jealous dames or grannys might reside &amp; take his visit on the blackest side To think him one who came with vile excuse Their artless Jinneys ignorance to seduce For such are often by experience wise &amp; knows seduction masks in loves disguise &amp; most old women have a jealous fear That doubts of tokens speaking most sincere Deeming the ways that wooers have to win A dangerous poison in a gilden skin &amp; lovers oft from their suspecting doubt Have mountains as it were to climb about &amp; ere they gain their wishes meet from hence The worst of pains attendant on suspence Thus Jockey thought as onward he sojournd &amp; started often &amp; as oft returnd He doubted much &amp; dreaded to attend Loves fickle footsteps to its journeys end Till on a sunday fully bent he rose To mend or bring the matter to a close &amp; thus attird in his best hopes &amp; dress His heart warmd often thinking on success Then dampt again but wether fail or speed He journeyd on determind to proceed Soon Jennys cottage rose upon his sight Enquirey questiond &amp; it was the right A boy was tending horses near the spot Who showd the pathway leading to the cott &amp; answering things which Jockey lovd to hear Reviving hopes &amp; lessening many a fear As how the friends of Jinney were as free As any people living need to be &amp; as for her shed every bodys praise For modest manners &amp; good naturd ways &amp; as thus far when Jockey matters found &amp; to the point contrivd to veigle round Bout who kept Jinney company &amp; that The boy guessd matters cockd his napless hat Rose up &amp; gan his horses names to bawl &amp; leeving turnd to mumble “none at all” Twas quite enough just as he wishd forsooth Far as boys storys might be taen for truth It lightnd up his heart such things to find &amp; made him hope success was in the wind The cottage door was now upon his view The twisting woodbines round the window grew The birds were wistling—ah how blest they seemd To be so near the object he esteemd An odd cow fed upon the neighbouring moor &amp; three cade lambs were playing near the door Who livd by tender care &amp; tamely stood To sip from Jennys hand their daily food Now past remembrance gan to flutter high To think the lovly stranger was so nigh &amp; former doubts rose topmost in their sway &amp; hopes on point to blossom dyd away To see her gen hed just go wander round &amp; end the rest when better chance was found The dog gun barking as he crossd the moor The poultry noisd &amp; open came the door Trifles een scares in such a lonly place Were even birds dislike a strangers face Jockey just turnd a shanny sideling eye To see who noticd as he lingerd bye Ah now thy courage love—twas past with him A shivering ague trembld every limb His hearts sensations oer its past delight Een flutterd like a birds as well it might That self same look that beautys lingering beams Kept bright so long by fancy &amp; by dreams That very face which he one morning met &amp; thought it lovliest he'd ere seen as yet For whom the gate was opd &amp; shut wi sighs That lovley girl was now before his eyes What must he say fear fixt him to the spot He woud have made excuse but had it not Love is so timid while it is so young He coud not own it how his heart was wrung Yet inly wishd the while that she but knew What he coud tell so tender &amp; so true His looks had meaning but young loves are shy &amp; plainest questions promt a first reply But false hopes pleasant while the test is tryd He durst not speak for fear of being denyd Tho Jinnys sweet simplicity &amp; grace Denyd ill nature in her lovley face &amp; half confirmd it as he shoold along By saying “good day” but Jockeys skill was young He knew it not or dare not yet pursue The little chances which in love he knew His hearts flushd wish the faultering tongue denyd He turnd to speak but only lookd &amp; sighd &amp; as he twirld his stick &amp; soodld on He left his blessings were his heart was gone For such good nature at a strangers door Made love burn stronger then it did before &amp; from that hour he vowd none else shoud be His future wife if Jinny woud agree There lay the doubt which paind his heart to think Nor let him nightly hardly sleep a wink &amp; thus in anguish as he homward went Oer gate &amp; stile conjecturingly he bent Making resolves as soon as he coud find A chance renewd to boldly speak his mind &amp; deep repenting over what was past To be so foolish as let slip the last Great was the conflict labouring in his breast Which only lovers can explain the best Conscerns of love are dangerously deferd Ere equal oppertunitys occurd A bolder lover might drop in the while &amp; all the present hopes entirely spoil He knew it well &amp; dreaded what he knew A maid so blooming &amp; so lovley too Like blossoms blooming fairer then the rest Attention drew from every one that past Urgd every eye with tempting gaze to turn &amp; left some hearts with quicker pulse to burn In sleepless pain that night was passd away His heart had left him &amp; his thoughts astray Fancy was picturing in his wandering head How Jane was sleeping in her peacfull bed Unconsious there of all her felt &amp; knew Of how he lovd &amp; dreaded to pursue &amp; tossd &amp; turnd while coward consience chid To meet such chance &amp; pass it as he did But all was vain the past was past as then &amp; too far travelld to be calld agen Yet ere he turnd him to retreating rest These wilder wishes left his aching breast “Ah powerfull night was but thy chances mine Had I but ways to come at joys as thine Spite of thy wizard look &amp; sable skin The ready road to bliss tis thine to win All nature owns of beautiful or sweet In thy embraces now unconsious meet Young Jinney ripening into womanhood That hides from day like lilys while in bud To thy grim visage blooms in all her charms &amp; comes like eve unblushing to thy arms Of thy black mantle coud I be possest How woud I pillow on her panting breast &amp; try those lips were trial rude beseems &amp; breath my spirit in her very dreams That neer a thought might wander from her heart But I possest it or ensurd a part Of all the blessing[s] that belong to thee Had I this one how happy shoud I be” Beauty thou sun shine of the passing hour At once so lovley &amp; so frail a flower Gilt toy of life—with which all plays his part Thou universal empress of the heart Who woud not wish for hearts ease in thy room One less delightfull or of longer bloom Coud love while doating on thy looks so fair But turn to days when time shall meddle there &amp; but reflect of its illfated spell Pleasd to undo what nature did so well To chill that cheek &amp; all its sweets deform Which youth had flushd so lucious &amp; so warm To dim those eyes &amp; all their darts destroy That brightning glows with misterys of joy &amp; damp those smiles that breath of silent bliss To miss whose tasting seems a heaven to miss Coud love but waken from its golden dreams &amp; see this shade which there a substance seems Sure he woud think those heart aches &amp; those sighs Too dear a purchase for so false a prize But love wears looks of heaven while it smiles &amp; Jockeys heart like others it beguiles Was warmd too much at beautys blushing sun To cool in reason when it once was won Janes memory now claimd Jockeys every thought Days came &amp; went but little joy they brought While abscence hopes &amp; intermingling fears Made hours to linger with the length of years In vain the summer time his toil beguiles With all her wild wood harmony &amp; smiles All disregarded Jockey passd em bye &amp; nothing claimd the notice of his eye For Jockeys taste was not the vulgar hinds He lookd oer nature with enlightend minds &amp; joyd like them ere love destroyd his rest To be the wild woods solitary guest To watch the brook boil oer its simmering tide &amp; crop the wild flower blooming by its side To list the moaning of the winds &amp; see The grass in billows shadowing oer the lea But love came on him with its burning bloom &amp; oer passt pleasures cast a sullen gloom As silver moon beams in effulgence shed Deepen nights darkness were they cannot spread So joys behind him darkend seem &amp; sour Lost in the sweetness of a brighter flower In vain did mirth excite him to forget In vain at dances on the green he met Were lovley faces might be seen again Which but revivd the image of his Jane Tho girls was there as fair &amp; sweet to see Were Jenny was not pleasure coud not be Save the thrilld pleasures that to hope woud cling For pains have pleasures when from love they spring &amp; had blind love been blest with eyes to see What many pains might then as strangers be What many souls that nature made to bind Without a sigh or heart ache might be joind How short with Jockey cares were doomd to dwell Had he but known that Jinney lovd as well Ah short had been his cares had he but known Her heart dwelt there a neighbour with his own For ever since the day he passd her door She deemd it earnest what she guessd before &amp; expectations every now &amp; then Woud warm in hopes to see him once agen Shed often provd a strangers forward gaze &amp; met with men impertinent to praise But Jockeys manners thoughts coud ill reveal &amp; still warmd notions which she lovd to feel To see her once then ramble to her home Sure somthing urgd him &amp; enticd to come While with uneasy doubts her fears was free To hint such notions might mistaken be Which often urgd a mellancholy sigh To check her blushing hopes when raisd too high Jane in these reveries pursud her way With lonley silence many a market day Nor ever coud the loneley lovley spot Were Jockey stood be wanderd bye forgot As of[t] as thro the gate she went or came A sigh &amp; look woud busy memory claim &amp; passing bye hopes oft her bosom burnd That she might meet him as she home returnd But hopes decievd her still &amp; many a day With lonley thoughts she went her lonley way For neer seemd spot so loan shed seen as yet As that were abscent Jockey first was met &amp; neer shone suns so sadly to her eye As shone that morning when he passd her bye &amp; even home had now no bliss to spare Love claimd her heart &amp; care pursued her there Beneath the eldern she was heard no more Toil making light with singing as before In melancholly speed days went &amp; came Her hopes was doubtful &amp; her peace the same The laughing pleasures that was such before Was now in mourning &amp; coud please no more The song of birds that usd to urge her own Reminded now what changes she had known The blooming flowers that usd to please her eye Now livd as proofs of pleasures that were bye Toil turnd a burthen—shoyness ill consceald The painfull feelings that such ways reveald Now night &amp; morn in silence she was seen With folded arms to soodle down the green No flower enticd her as she sought the cow &amp; woodbines wreathd neglected round the bough While round her path the lambs woud often stand Bleating complaints of her neglecting hand But fancyd joys that to the future cling Gleamd oft like sunshine thro the clouds in spring &amp; hopes were budding with a future day That now &amp; then half drove despair away Some weeks to come a village feast woud be When Jinney hopd the strangers face to see Twas from her cottage scarcley half a mile &amp; might fullwell such artless thought beguile Sure if hed notions as she hopd he might Hed neer miss coming to the dance at night &amp; if he lovd her as she hopd he did Such chance to meet from him woud not be hid So Jinney judgd &amp; to her hearts delight Found all her wishes when it came was right Nor fruitless was her prayers for on that day Suns shone as wishd &amp; rain kept far away Paths were as clean as wishes coud desire Nor wet nor dew to sully her attire Her sundays best that eve she hastend on With warmest hopes to win &amp; to be won A gay straw hat with ribbons on the peak Of roseys hue like that upon her cheek Oer her white bosom loves delicious bed A silken hankerchief was loosly spread That hid its swelling sweets in carless ways &amp; still left room for armorous eyes to gaze A fine new gown round boddice lightly bracd Flowd to the wind &amp; claspd her slender waist While dust to shun she held it to her side Disclosing beautys which she seemd to hide A slender ancle clad in stocking white Which swelld in sweet propo[r]tions out of sight &amp; jet black was her shoe &amp; polishd high Tyd wi black ribbon in a gracful tye Thus in her best on tiptoe to be seen With bosom warmd its hopes &amp; doubts between She left her cot half weand from lingering care To seek the dance in hopes to meet him there &amp; sure enough as wishd 'spectations came For Jockeys hopes that evening were the same &amp; at an earlier hour from toil releasd He drest him smart &amp; hastnd to the feast Anxious &amp; hopfull as he pac'd the street Neath every hat the lovly face to meet &amp; to the dance with hopes unprovd as yet He went &amp; lookd &amp; there the face was met Tween hopes &amp; fears his courage flutterd chill Then warmd agen but doubted strongly still But looks he venturd &amp; woud looks repeat &amp; venturd near Jane blushd but kept her seat Emboldnd thus love from its silence broke Seizing her hand that trembld while he spoke He hopd to be his partner shed consent Nor deem him rude when rudness was not meant “Yes” beat her bosom mid its throbs &amp; sighs Fond to reveal but modest to disguise Her eyes met his a smile half blushd to view &amp; glowd more tenderer as he urgd anew His suit he movd with fonder freedom still &amp; Jenny rose as if against her will Half shrinking from herself with fears &amp; bliss Neer urgd till now &amp; now as urgd amiss &amp; tho her coyness downward turnd the while From Jockeys view she coud not hide the smile Which gave consent &amp; plainly told the rest That hopes half speeded &amp; woud soon be blest For he as yet had venturd not to move His suit so far to tell her it was love But speaking eyes have language in their way Whose looks oft seem to chide the tongues delay &amp; Jinney often neath her bonnets brim When others lookd not turnd to gaze on him &amp; oh so sweet so languishing the while Tween blushing coyness &amp; a dimpling smile They plainly askd him ere they turnd aside To kiss those lips that reddnd to be tryd &amp; press that bosom hand had never prest &amp; wisper love &amp; put all doubts to rest But Jockey perseverd with modesty Nor urgd too forward fear of being too free He led her down the dance with hopes beguild &amp; often nipt her hand &amp; often smild Till evenings end proclaimed night too nigh That left its admonitions with a sigh On more then Jenney when with many a maid The dance must stop &amp; parents be obey'd She sought her shawl which caution loosley threw Around her neck to guard against the dew &amp; left the dance &amp; for her home sojournd But turnd a look on Jockey as she turnd Who sued to walk as guardian by her side Nor seemd she to consent nor yet denyd Still Jockey urgd successes to pursue Took her white arm &amp; brushd the nightly dew Offering assistance oer each stile &amp; brook &amp; felt the joy to see it kindly took Adventuring often on their lonly way By closer hints his meaning to convey Oft bringing memory round her mind to try Of that first morning when she past him bye To prove if he had aught of fondness won &amp; livd with her as she with him had done While Jennys meek &amp; modest sighs conseald Her warm consent to fondness thus reveald &amp; pity tis that hours that bring us joy Shoud lend that wings which follows to destroy Time seems with grief to loiter &amp; delay But flyes from hearts that wishes him to stay Soon came their journeys end how much too soon Tho quite contrary gleamd the mounting moon That seemd that night to gallop on his way &amp; hinted now theyd made too much delay Abruptly on their sight the cottage rose &amp; loves tales stopt when warmest to disclose For raptures now did all his fears efface &amp; love was shown in many a warm embrace But hours of meeting sweet as they begin Have parting ones that claim too near a kin Glimmering thro Jinneys window light did burn That showd her parents waited her return Fled was those modest hours she usd to keep &amp; night was slumbering in its soundest sleep So they must part—still Jockey lingerd nigh &amp; sigh'd complaints which Jenney coud but sigh Whatever wishes in her breast might burn Jane must retire &amp; Jockey must return She dare not risk the hazard or the blame To take a stranger to a chiding dame So part they must—but Jockey sued agen For one more kiss one minute more &amp; then Prest her soft hand &amp; much against his will Sighd “Jane farewell”—&amp; held her prisoner still Till thoughts of friends wakd innoscent alarms &amp; forcd young Jinney from her lovers arms “Then as we must—farewell” exclaimd the swain “Till sundays leisure &amp; Im here again” She sighd consent—he viewd his lonly ways Then turnd agen as wishing new delays But Jinney timid with the depth of night Opend the door &amp; vanishd from his sight Where the old folks her glad approach did wait &amp; urgd their questions of her being so late But kept it secret what they guessd the while &amp; heard excuses tween a frown &amp; smile They knew their daughters manners up to this Nor yet had doubted of her doing amiss Her father hinted his advice in time Tho well he knew hed done the little crime &amp; while he guessd the late hour savourd love He check'd the dame nor venturd to reprove So all was right—Jane dreemd about the swain &amp; counted hours when they shoud meet again &amp; surley nights did never seem so slow To bring the sun &amp; bid the sun to go Then those that passd between with lagging feet That eves first meeting &amp; the next to meet At length it came &amp; Jane oft turnd her eye Upon the window watching passers bye Whose blushing hopes was startld into joys At every footstep or approaching noise When ere the gate clapt creaking on the moor She left her book &amp; venturd to the door For Jane had long been taught her god to fear &amp; tho there was no place of worship near She knew what duty on that day requird &amp; always took her bible as desird Still Jinneys bible had not power to chide Loves tempting charm with innoscence its guide Oft did she think of more then what she read &amp; towards the window often turnd her head Nor did she long those cheating hopes pursue Ere Jockeys presence provd his promise true In thoughtfull mood she markd him on the moor Taking the path that winded to the door Were soon a fearfull rap warnd Jane to move Her best excuse &amp; intercede for love Let this suffice she told the simple tale &amp; told it true as better to prevail They cooly heard it but denyd him not So he half doubtfull enterd in the cott Were Jenny smiling as she set the chair Provd he by one was doubly welcome there &amp; soon his modest unasuming ways Urgd the old folks' opinion in his praise With each new visit grew increasd esteem Proving sincere what first might doubtfull seem &amp; oft he came &amp; many a sabbath day They toyd with bliss &amp; lovd its hours away Oft seeking pleasure that retirement yields In peacful rambles round the silent fields Unseen while wandering in each lonley dell Unheard while talking what they lovd to tell Sitting to rest on sunny bauk or stile &amp; kindred feelings as they sat the while Explaining there—how abscence gave them pain &amp; joys encreasd when thus they met again &amp; oft while wandering thus in summers hours Hed match her beauty with surrounding flowers Comparing some to blushes on her cheek Some to her lips when tingd with ruddier streak &amp; those more sweet &amp; whiter then the rest That to her breath &amp; this her swelling breast &amp; then half shrinking from his ardent gaze Hed snatch a kiss as purchase for his praise Thus hours were spent &amp; time as passing bye Kept knitting love with closer tenderer tye No change creating as is oft the case Kindling fresh fondness for a stranger face With Jockeys feelings change woud ill agree Tho he saw faces that was sweet to see Yet warmest fancy always rose at will &amp; picturd abscent Jinny fairer still By frequent visits love at length was led To bring up questions when they might be wed Their friends consent was all that left delay They askd &amp; had it &amp; they fixd the day The friends of Jane had learnd her how to live &amp; Jockeys friends had little else to give For tho to desent living they attaind Riches by them was neither prizd nor gaind Land they possest but niggard was the soil &amp; just returned a recompence for toil Virtue &amp; industry their choice requir'd Them Jane possest &amp; they was all desir'd So all was fixt &amp; soon the morning came When Jane shoud be a bride &amp; change her name &amp; Jockeys heart that morn with bliss was warm But Jenney trembld as she took his arm Tho gay companions cheer'd her journying on &amp; soon the church proclaimd their journey done Where Jenny enterd chiding what she felt &amp; meekly down before the vicar knelt Who tyd that nott &amp; not without its sigh Which all save death is puzzld to untye With Jockey still all cares was set aside He lookd with raptures on his lovley bride Whose fondness coud not overcome her fears She smild returning but she smild in tears &amp; when her husband urgd the reason why She coud not tell—unless it was for joy First love how sweet ah woud it longer last Tho time remembers it when felt &amp; past Tis but a shadow of a substance gone A setting sunbeam to a rising one Hope feeds on joys imagination gives Which in this world as pictures only lives Attempt it, oft half care half joy we find Posses it quite cares often left behind Love like the Sensitive oft proves as such Fair to the eye &amp; withering at the touch Revealing cares that marriage vows await Which brings repentence that is brought too late But Jane &amp; Jockey little had to do With such as yet while honey moons was new Bright in their infancy of rapturd gleams No cares were yet to cloud such lovley dreams First love is theirs—what else may interpose Here they are blest &amp; here the tale shall close The Sorrows of Love or The Broken Heart A Tale “Good shepherd tell this youth what tis to love “It is to be all made of sighs &amp; tears— “—All made of faith &amp; service “All made of passion &amp; all made of wishes “All humbleness all patience &amp; impatience Shakspear [As You Like It 5.2.76–7, 82, 88–90] To sober wi sad truths the laughing mirth Of rosey daughters round the cottage hearth Who in the innosence that youth beguiles Haild new years eve like holidays wi smiles &amp; pass the winters lengthend eve away A mother told the tale of sally Grey “How time” she said “&amp; pleasure passes bye” &amp; stopt to whipe the tear drops from her eye “Twenty or thirty years when past away “Seem like an hour glass turnings for one day “Nay fifty years to come the same when gone “Lives in our memorys scarce the length of one “Ere half a bottom from the spool is wound “Or falling water soaketh in the ground “Time gains upon us distance unawares “Stealing our joys &amp; changing them for cares “Tis nine &amp; thirty years this very day “Since I beheld the last of Sally Grey” Then pausd &amp; lookd above her were she sat &amp; reachd the bible down to prove the date Whose blank leaves did a catalogue display Of names &amp; dates the year &amp; month &amp; day When boys &amp; girls were born &amp; old friends dyd These still existed memorys certain guide That lay wi penny storys rustling near &amp; almanacks prese[r]vd for many a year Stopping the story till she found the place Pulling her glasses from their leathern case Twas right &amp; from her lap in saddend vein She took her knitting &amp; went on again “Poor thing she dyd heart broken &amp; distrest “Thro love tho docters who may know the best “Said twas decline that wasted life away “But truth is truth &amp; be it as it may “She neer did aught that malice can reprove “Her only failing was the fault of love “Tis hard enough when innoscen[c]e is hurld “On the cold bosom of an heartless world “When mockery &amp; stony hearted pride “Reveals the failings pity strives to hide “&amp; wi sad cruel taunt &amp; bitter jest “Lays thorns to pillow troubles broken rest “But when a poor young thing like Sally dies “For love &amp; only love were is the eyes “Can look in memorys face wi out a tear “Een scorn finds nought to turn aside &amp; sneer “But silent stands while pity shakes her head “&amp; thinks tears just it self declines to shed “Twas by anothers failings that she fell “Whose wanton follys was her passing bell “A clown as wild as young colts freed from plough “Who saw a prison in a marriage vow “Had won her heart &amp; kept it in his power “As the rude bindweed clasps the tender flower “A clown as shifty as the summer wind “To him her heart &amp; love was all resignd “Poor girl I felt in trouble for her end “A next door neighbour &amp; an only friend “Seldom apart till strangers woud consent “To take us sisters weresoere we went “Her father kept a cottage next to ours “A market gardener &amp; he dealt in flowers “Were swains on sabbath days would oft resort “To buy fine poesys for a sunday coat “The ‘touchmenot’ that like a nettle stung “What ere it met was often hid among “The flowers of those who lovd rude jokes to trye “Wi fond unthinking wenches passing bye “Offering wi serious face as all were well “Which bit their noses when they bent to smell “&amp; cloves he had the sweetest flower that grows “&amp; anemonys double as the rose “Wi velvet 'raculas bepowderd flower “That lookd as some one in an idle hour “Had stoopt adown to dust em oer wi meal “&amp; scores of names besides—here oft woud steal “Poor sallys beau who bought his flowers the while “Wi double prices money &amp; a smile “&amp; many a wisper of loves cheating powers “That calld her fairest of her fathers flowers “Such ways like spring hopes youngling blood did move “&amp;

oft on summer eves or sabbath days “Hed join our walks &amp; surfiet her wi praise “Nay she coud scarcly to the church repair “But he held out his arm to lead her there “&amp; to her fathers house he often went “Who welcome gave &amp; deemd it kindly meant “&amp; crackt of goods &amp; savings oer his ale “Things he had addld by his spade &amp; flail “&amp; showing oft wi fatherly regard “The pigs &amp; poultry in his little yard “How this &amp; that as matters closer led “Were marriage portions when their daughter wed “The childern they her little sisters three “Began to know him &amp; woud climb his knee “&amp; whisperd little storys in his ear “&amp; calld him brother which he smild to hear “&amp; to reward them for each prattling way “He promisd bride cake on the wedding day “&amp; wi loves keep sakes brought from fair or wake “He near forgot the childerns nutts or cake “I markd these things for I was often bye “&amp; ever thought the wedding day was nigh “For as a neeghbour oft by night &amp; day “I took my work in to pass time away “&amp; oft wi out it on a winters eve “Ive stole away nor askd a mothers leave “To play at cards &amp; talk of dress beside “For wenches heads are ever after pride “No holiday ere came but he was there “For whom the father left his corner chair “Her mother blessd 'em as she touchd the glass “&amp; wishd him luck &amp; nodded to the lass “&amp; all beheld him when the freak begun “In kindred prospect as a promisd son “Thus for awhile his fawning love did burn “&amp; doubts arose at every touch &amp; turn “If she but nodded at a fair or wake “To chaps she knew it made his bosom ache “Or said ‘good morning’ to a passer bye “She always had a rival in her eye “&amp; jealousy woud fawningly complain “&amp; urge to vows ere he was right again “But when he found her heart was all his own “He quickly made his foolish follys known “&amp; like a young bird childern use in play “He teazd &amp; plagud it till it pind away “He lovd her on but thought it mighty fun “To prove her fondness when the maid was won “From every night to once a week they met “&amp; then excuses made it longer yet “Somtimes he coud not stay as heretofore “But calld her out to wisper at the door “&amp; turnd away &amp; smild self satisfied “To see the tear drops which she strove to hide “He dancd wi other girls his pride to please “&amp; seemd to glory in the chance to teaze “Thinking it fine so many hearts to win “&amp; smild to see the blushes she was in “He did such things he said her love to tell “&amp; crackd of morts that lovd him full as well “At feast &amp; fair Ive seen the fellow start “Up from his chair to offer girls the quart “&amp; then look round him wi a leering eye “&amp; drank their healths while she was sitting bye “Her face burnt red as any cloak the while “&amp; tears woud startle while she strove to smile “&amp; oft when nigh a soldier he has sat “Hed laugh &amp; put the colors on his hat “But he too great a coward was to go “For nought but cowards uses women so “Twas only to perplex the heart hed won “For no one cause but insolence &amp; fun “&amp; he did hurt her tho she lovd him still “&amp; patiently put up wi every ill “Nursing the venom of that speckld snake “About her heart till it was glad to break “Yet when I cautiond her of loves distress “&amp; bade her notice the wild fellow less “Saying she showd her love too much by half “‘Mary you jest’ she said &amp; made a laugh “For we on sabbath days in pleasant weather “Went still to walk &amp; talk of love together “&amp; often sought a hut beside the wood “That from the town a gossips minute stood “Twas calld the herdsmans hut for when her spouse “Walkd wi out sticks he kept the village cows “Ere vile enclosure took away the moor “&amp; farmers built a workhouse for the poor “Here the old woman for wants small rewards “Woud tell our fortunes both by cups &amp; cards “Some calld her witch &amp; wisperd all they dare “Of nightly things that had been noticd there “Witches of every shape that usd to meet “To count the stars or mutterd charms repeat “Woodmen in winter as they passd the road “Have vowd theyve seen some crawling like a toad “&amp; some like owlets wewing over head “Shrieking enough to frighten them to dead “Nay some have witnessd as they passd that way “Grey owlets whooping in the very day “&amp; in the trees that did their shadows fling “Close to the door the noisey crows in spring “Woud build their nests unscard when she was bye “&amp; tho they saw her never card to flye “&amp; some like kites high overhead woud watch “Tho shed no chickens in her yard to catch “Yet she to us appeard like other folks “A droll old woman full of tales &amp; jokes “&amp; many a summers eve weve stole away “From bawling cows that needed us to stay “&amp; neathe the crooked hedge beside the lane “Oft hid our milk pails till we turnd again “Were briar &amp; woodbine in the sumer hours “Hung like a garden coverd oer wi flowers “&amp; soon as ere our shadows reachd the wall “A magpie which she kept woud scold &amp; bawl “&amp; peep &amp; follow as we opd the door “&amp; woud unbidden run its gabble oer “While she would twirl the tea grounds round the cup “Or take the pack to cut or shuffle up “Twoud mock the old dame in her deep discourse “&amp; sqawl so deafning till it een was hoarse “Till the old dame to let her tale be heard “Was forcd to take &amp; throw her in the yard “&amp; some woud call &amp; vouchd the thing as true “The bird a witch that told her all she knew “I cannot say as what the thing might be “Twas like the magpies which we always see “But I am certain wether bad or good “Twoud talk as plain as any christian coud “Her very cat too bore an evil name “Because twas fondld up &amp; made so tame “That like a dog twoud follow her to town “Purring behind or rubbing by her gown “&amp; oft as homward wi our milk weve came “Loitering along when chance has met the dame “Her cat was ever partner in her walk “&amp; when weve sat the buckets down to talk “Soon as our eyes was turnd twoud instant plop “To lap the milk upon the bucket top “&amp; knowing what theyve said about the town “Ive seen it oft nor card to turn it down “But if the old dames ways was darkly meant “I near saw nothing tho I often went “Deal as she might wi satans evil powers “She read her bible &amp; was fond of flowers “&amp; went to church as other people may “&amp; knelt &amp; prayd tho witches cannot pray “She had her ague charms &amp; old reciepts “For wounds &amp; bruises labour often meets “&amp; gatherd wild flowers in her summer toils “To make her ointments that was famd for miles “&amp; many a one hath ownd her homly skill “That dare not run a docters larger bill “&amp; as to ill got knowledge of the sky “She was as innocent as you &amp; I “She might no doubt wi pointed finger show “The shepherds lamp which even childer know “&amp; doubtless lovd when journeying from the town “To see it rising soon as day was down “The taylors yardband too hung streaming high “&amp; dicks night waggon driving thro the sky “&amp; butchers cleaver or the seven stars “Wi shooting north lights tokening bloody wars “She might know these which if its sin to know “Then every body is a witch below “Well those are good that never do no wrong “&amp; blest are they that scape an evil tongue “Thus to young hopes she woud her fortunes tell “But sally quickly knew her own too well “Time by degrees unriddled the mistake “&amp; left her dreams of fondness wide awake “Her tears &amp; sighs did all too vainly prove “To keep the shepherd to his vows of love “He came to vex her oft &amp; woud not stay “&amp; shut the door agen &amp; laughd away “Cause she was spotless &amp; a maiden still “Consience near prickt him that the deed was ill “&amp; he made promises to give her pain “Just for the sake of breaking them again “On winter nights for hours Ive known her stand “Listning wi door half open in her hand “They say love feels no cold but she has stood “To wait his coming when he said he woud “Till her very teeth hath chatterd in her head “Like the third ague ere she went to bed “So what wi colds &amp; an uneasy mind “Beauty soon faded &amp; her health declind “The rose that lovers call so left her face “&amp; the pale sickly lily took its place “Thus she went on poor mellancholy thing “Just like a bud thats injurd in the spring “That may live on to see the coming may “A feeble blossom leaning on decay “As little linnets pine in summers joys “For absent loves a shooting clown destroys “She sorrowd on &amp; worse &amp; worse she grew “Till strength declind its labour to pursue “Yet wishing still her sorrows to conseal “She turnd wi feeble hand her spinning wheel “Till weak &amp; weary when no one was bye “Shed lean her back ward in her chair to cry “At length the parents tho wi added fears “Saw thro her heart throbs &amp; her secret tears “&amp; when they found the only crime was love “They jokd at times &amp; woud by turns reprove “Saying if that was all the world possest “For causing troubles few woud be distrest “Nor make a grief of such a foolish thing “Were loves were plenty as the flowers in spring “But all was vain she put her best looks on “When they was there &amp; grievd when they were gone “Till toil &amp; fretting brought her down so low “That she was forcd her labour to forgo “Her friends no longer wi false hopes beguild “Feard for the danger of their troubld child “&amp; on the fellows folly closd their door “&amp; bade him teaze her wi his lies no more “I often went &amp; sat me by her side “To cheer her spirits while her mother cried “Who bade her daughter oer &amp; oer agen “Think more of god &amp; less of naughty men “But all was vain she made us no reply “Or only answerd wi a smotherd sigh “Her childern sisters oft hung round her chair “On which she leant in silence &amp; despair “Her troubld looks they coud not understand “&amp; tryd to raise her head from off her hand “&amp; askd the reason why she sat so still “Or if aught wrongd her that had made her ill “She kissd their prattling lips wi struggling sighs “While anguish rushd for freedom to her eyes “Then woud she turn away from friends &amp; kin “&amp; hide the trouble that her heart was in “Still woud they teaze her on poor little things “Twitch at her gown &amp; pull her apron strings “&amp; eke her sorrow wi her lovers name “Urging the reason why he never came “Bringing up childish memorys to her cost “Things they had missd &amp; pleasures she had lost “Talking of fairings which he usd to bring “&amp; showing fragments of each broken thing “Clay sergants broken armd wi faded sash “&amp; one eyd dolls &amp; churns wi out a dash “Things he oft brought his early suit to move “Trifles for childern valud proofs for love “Thus they woud urge &amp; end wi scornfull brow “‘A naughty man he brings us nothing now’ “She stopt their mouths wi kisses &amp; wi sighs “&amp; turnd her face again to hide her eyes “Her mother talkd of patience all in vain “&amp; read jobs troubles oer &amp; oer again “Then turnd to love &amp; read the book of ruth “Making excuses for the faults of youth “Saying how she in lifes young joys was crost “&amp; both a lover &amp; a husband lost “Yet still hopd on &amp; overlookd the past “&amp; lovd her mother &amp; was blest at last “&amp; if said she you trust in god &amp; pray “You may be happy in the end as they “&amp; she herself woud often try to read “The bibles comforts in the hour of need “But soon she faild the cheering truths to look “&amp; got so weak as scarce to lift the book “The fellow bye &amp; bye his folly mournd “His consience prickt him or his love returnd “He begd &amp; prayd &amp; wishd again to be “Once more admitted to her company “The parents thought twoud save their sinking child “For troubles hopes are easy reconsild “&amp; gave the villain leave agen to come “&amp; more then that to make their cot his home “When he came first I sat beside her bed “He askd her how she was &amp; hung his head “She bursted into tears &amp; coud not speak “&amp; as she leand her sorrow wasted cheek “Upon her hand he did his sins recall “She kissd him fondly &amp; forgave him all “Her face was thin &amp; lost its healthy red “White as the sheets turnd down upon her bed “No doubt he felt an anguish in her pain “&amp; seemd to pause ere he coud speak again “Vows he renewd as cures for every ill “She turnd to me &amp; sighd ‘they never will’ “Then smild &amp; bowd her faded face to weep “&amp; wearied out sunk down like one asleep “Then rose agen like one awoke from pain “&amp; gazd on him &amp; me &amp; wept again “&amp; on her bosom laid her wasted hand “Sighing a language b[r]utes might understand “He took her hand but the poor mother prayd “His stay to comfort the dejected maid “He heard it gladly &amp; he did remain “Set down his stick &amp; closd the door again “&amp; of their humble living shard a part “&amp; livd an inmate of her house &amp; heart “&amp; hopes was fed tho but the mask of pain “As she recoverd &amp; got out again “She seemd so well they een began to name “The wedding day—twas set &amp; ere it came “Hope got so strong her friends were fixd upon “To act as bride maids &amp; myself was one “While gossips when they met woud still agree “To shake their heads &amp; say twoud never be “Muttering oer doubts they woud not urge aloud “Saying her bride dress woud turn out a shroud “God knows they but too truly prophesyd “For ere it came she sickend worse &amp; dyd “Upon that very morn that was to be “The wedding sunshine &amp; festivity “Death did so gently his cold fingers lay “Upon her bosom that she sild away “Without a groan &amp; but for us that wept “About her bed one might have thought she slept “For marriage greetings parents sorrows fell “&amp; marriage peals changd to a passing bell “Her young sun set neath sorrows settld cloud “Wed to the grave her bride sheets was a shroud “&amp; I who thought to see her dress that day “A brides wi love notts dizend out so gay “Saw it preparing at the joiners shop “Who trimd the white lace round the coffin top “They usd to use it in my early day “For such as went off young like sally grey “He was a merry man &amp; always free “&amp; stopt his work to throw a nail at me “There Mary take you that he smild &amp; said “Twill help for yours in case you die a maid “I passd it off for jokings mean no ill “&amp; I have kept it for her memory still “Aye aye instead of joining in the throng “Of merry faces &amp; a wedding song “Instead of seeing her a bride become “I bore the pall up to her last long home “&amp; heard the old clerks mellancholy stave “That sung the psalm bareheaded by her grave “Life to a spiders web had wore &amp; spun “&amp; een her hands if lifted to the sun “Were both so wasted that to fancys view “The light woud almost seem to glimer thro “Thus dyd poor sally on her wedding day “An april bud that could not see the may “Nor did the cause from whence her cares begun “Live long to mourn the evil he had done “A year scarce past—god every evil sees “Ere he was struck wi sickness &amp; disease “The small pox came that blight to girls &amp; boys “&amp; spreading famine of a mothers joys “Waking its fears of danger far &amp; wide “But none save him throughout the village dyd “Poor sallys parents who forgave the wrong “Agreed to his last wishes right or wrong “&amp; close beside the church yards gravel way “He lyes a schoolboys leap from sally grey “I often stood to gaze upon the stone “When ere I journeyd to the church alone “Were gold wingd cherubs held a flowery wreath “Over a prayer book open underneath “Upon whose leaves was writ at her request “In gilded letters ‘here the weary rest’ “Last spring one sabbath day I loiterd there “Before the bells had chimd the hour of prayer “Stopping as pity seemly did demand “I wrapt my apron corner round my hand “&amp; pulld the nettles that had overgrown “The verse &amp; rambld half way up the stone “My tale is growing fast but I must tell “What in my mind will [n]ever cease to dwell “Some people make a mock &amp; laugh at dreams “&amp; call them shades were things so plainly seems “&amp; say tis silly as a maid to stand “&amp; let the gipsey cross her in the hand “Well let folks laugh I think it not so well “Wi joking ways on serious things to dwell “I think dreams truths myself or mostly such “&amp; joseph in the bible thought as much “Nay he the causes of such visions knew “&amp; pharoahs baker found his words too true “All eyes may see it if they do but look “Then who woud laugh &amp; disbelieve the book “The dream I have to tell which sally told “Woud make ones flesh in dog days creep wi cold “&amp; as to proofs I think it needeth none “Truth proves itself so listen till Ive done “Once in our lives when follys did decieve “We made the dumb cake upon saint marks eve “Sitting on thorns we scarcly dare to wait “Ere twas half done we took it off the slate “&amp; walking backwards up the stairs to bed “We thought one followd wi a sliving tread “&amp; sally startling faster wi the fright “Burnt her loose capstring as she held the light “She shriekd to see it &amp; we spoild the cake “For when folks do it nones alowd to spake “Had we been still plain shadows of the men “That were to court us woud have risen then “But sally spoke &amp; we no further knew “Of what Ive heard old women vouch as true “&amp; sure I am we heard the stepping sound “Of somthing stealing lightly oer the ground “As one at ‘I spy’ sliveth gently on “They seemd as wishing to approach unknown “Just like cats stepping upon boarden floors “But none were there wed turnd em out of doors “We hastend into bed to fears repose “&amp; hid our faces underneath the cloaths “Nor dare we stay to put the candle out “But left it burning half the night about “&amp; dare not once unclose a waken eye “Lest aught shoud come &amp; push the curtains bye “For we as was agreed wi parents leave “Slept both together on that witches eve “But I saw nothing worser then myself “&amp; heard what might be mice upon the shelf “Tho sally dreamd &amp; when she told it me “Quakd like a winter leaf upon the tree “&amp; many a day it made her memory ach “For she still fancyd she was wide awake “She thought her lover came beside her bed “&amp; lookd in trouble &amp; hung down his head “&amp; shook her hand &amp; wi a heavy smile “From out his pocket took a ring the while “Twoud fit no finger tho he tryd em all “&amp; dropt &amp; broke to ashes in the fall “&amp; instantly she said she seemd to see “Herself as plain as you appear to me “Bend by his side as one thats weak &amp; sick “&amp; aids the loss of strength upon a stick “Wi face all pale &amp; nought but skin &amp; bone “&amp; yet she felt that it was like her own “She vowd she saw them at the alter stand “Plain as I see this knitting in my hand “Both in a long dress wrapt from head to feet “Like shadows folks in haunted places meet “Molds seemd she said the alter steps to pave “Mingld wi terrors like a new made grave “Rust eaten nails &amp; bones in pieces cleft “By sextons spades &amp; tarnishd letters left “On breastplates which once buried names had spelt “She saw all these &amp; frighted as she felt “She coud not wake &amp; were the green cloth lay “On th'alters table every sabbath day “A black one hung &amp; in full folds did wreath “As if it hid a coffin underneath “The bells seemd knolling too a heavy sound “Like pots thats crackt or somthing under ground “Or as the clock the hour in winter tells “Muffld in snow they humd like passing bells “She shriekd &amp; woke me but she dare not name “The cause of terror till the daylight came “She often feard its end &amp; were alas “Has dismal dreams brought sadder proofs to pass “I thought dreams truths let folks laugh as they will “&amp; if tis foolish I believe em still “Last christmass eve when ye were at the door “Whispering wi sweethearts your love secrets oer “I took my glasses to amuse myself “&amp; reachd the bible down from off the shelf “To read the text &amp; look the psalms among “To find the one that at her grave was sung “The place had long been doubld down before “&amp; much I wishd ye in to read it oer “Your fathers read it to me many a time “When ye were young &amp; on our laps woud climb “Nay keep your work tis not worth while to leave “Ill sit &amp; hear it on to morrow eve “For even if the night woud time alow “My hearts so sad I cannot hear it now “Ive talkd till I have almost tird my tongue “Folks say old womens tales are always long “So here Ill end &amp; like it as ye may “I wish ye better luck then sally grey” She ceasd her tale &amp; snuffd the candle wick Lifting it up from burning in the stick That soon had faild to light her story out Had she continued spinning it about Then laid her knitting down &amp; shook her head &amp; stoopd to stir the fire &amp; talk of bed The Rivals A Pastoral Beneath a meadow brig whose arch was dry Some shepherds gatherd till a shower was bye Upon whose smooth half circling roof of stone Rude figurd scrawls in different colors shone Spread hands &amp; birds &amp; self imagind flowers Pastimes of hinds imprisond there by showers Some made wi ruddle that the shepherd swain Uses to mark &amp; know his sheep again &amp; some by firesticks chances haply find About the spot by gipseys left behind &amp; many a deeply cut two letter name Were knives was spoilt to win an inch of fame That linger on for years about the spot Brands of oblivion living yet forgot There the swains lingerd till the storm was oer Sitting on stones rolld in for seats before Some sat them down at leisures pleasant toil &amp; made them apple scopes of bone the while One crimpt a nitting skeath upon his knees To please a maiden whom he wishd to please An older swain did his wet rest employ In making whistles for an anxious boy Who sat in anxious watchings by his side Waiting their finish with exulting pride While two young swains in loves discoursings fell Lapping up love knott platts &amp; many a spell Of broad green reed blades were the sheltered midge Dancd in their shadows by the mossy bridge Swallows that darted thro the arch at play Heard the rude noise &amp; popt another way Richard My love forgets me never every spell Links as I lap it &amp; betokens well When I was young &amp; went a weeding wheat We usd to make them on our dinner seat &amp; laid two blades across &amp; lapd them round Thinking of those we lovd &amp; if we found Them linkd together when unlapt again Our love was true if not the wish was vain An old droll woman who first told it me Vowd that a truer token coud not be Simon Three times Ive lapd mine up &amp; still tis out A fatal number had I cause to doubt But Mary field flower still is fond &amp; free &amp; near shows nothing to dishearten me I care not what such foolish trifles tells For I can bring up better proofs then spell[s] Richard Then show them Simon for if she be true To lovers vows she has no room for two Near feast on fancy tis a dangerous food To take as earnest in a loving mood She throws a rosey veil round self conse[i]t That like the canker round the heart will eat Till theres ought left to cherish her disguise Then like worm eaten fruit it drops &amp; dies If I judge right the maid you name is mine Nor without proofs will I her truth resign Simon These I can give in plenty tho I own I never knew that she had kindness shown To other shepherds then my self till now &amp; much more chaind her freedom with a vow Last old may fair when I got bold wi beer I lovd her long before but had a fear To speak as by a stall she chancd to stand Wi kerchief full of farings in her hand I venturd up &amp; tapd her oer the arm She seemd at first to startle wi alarm But when I begd a faring at the wake She loosd her kerchief &amp; pulld out a cake &amp; in return for her good naturd ways I offerd ribbons which I heard her praise But she refusd &amp; said shed plenty got &amp; thankd me kindly tho she had them not Richard When ere at sunday feast or rushing fair I go &amp; meet wi rosey Mary there If my dog finds her first he rubs her cloaths &amp; wags his tail een she to him bestows A ginger button &amp; quick turns agen Thinking his masters not far from her then &amp; when she notices were I may be She comes unaskd to offer things to me &amp; neer refuses the returns I make But meanest trifles condesends to take &amp; when Im backward in my gifts to try Her love shell ask me what I mean to buy Last christmas blast I joind the skaiting crew That yearly racd for hats wi ribbons blue &amp; swam away wi young hopes swiftest pace Nor was I cheated for I won the race &amp; when I took the ribbons home at night To Mary she seemd trembling wi delight &amp; near refusd the profferd gift to take But said well done Ill keep it for your sake Simon Once we with others at a neighbours met To play at cards when she agen me set &amp; tho at first she edgd her chair away She got more free as we began to play &amp; from the table as my cards I took Shed smile &amp; oer my shoulder steal a look To make believe in true loves fondling way She wishd to know the cards I had to play &amp; when to try her love I made pretence To leave off playing for the wants of pence She from her lap took out the penny fee &amp; put it neath the candlestick for me &amp; tho she woud not take when we retird My hand to guide her home as I desird She said tho night was dark the way was short &amp; wishd good night &amp; thankd me kindly fort Richard Last martinmass at night we joind to play A hand or two &amp; keep a holiday When we chusd partners not as love regards But by the fortunes of the lifted cards When Mary peept at one she took in hand &amp; lookd at me to make me understand Pointing the color in her flowery dress I took the hint &amp; well knew which to guess The colord card said I my guesses seek Is somthing like the rose on marys cheek A bonny red for me—she laughd outright &amp; said then Im your partner for the night &amp; blushd &amp; hitchd her chair up close to mine &amp; paid wi joy her kiss for every fine When the hour came for mirth &amp; time to part Tho it was late she seemd as loath to start &amp; tho the full moon shone as bright as day She almost askd me if Id lead the way Making broad signs by many an urgd complaint How she had sat till she was fit to faint &amp; the rude cumbering umberella got To load her journey when twas wanted not I took the hint &amp; askd if she woud go When she jumpd up wi out the least ado &amp; took my arm nor illness longer feignd &amp; quite fo[r]got that she had ere complaind These are plain proofs &amp; I can bring up morts To show whose name is nearest in her thoughts Simon Once neath a hugh ash tree she made a stop To view a magpies nest upon the top I thought she wishd the eggs &amp; up I went Nor stopt to ask her looking what it meant The grain sweed like a bulrush in the wind But I clumb on &amp; left my fears behind She praisd the spotted eggs but seemed in pain So up I took them to the nest again Poor birds she sighed to hear them noise &amp; flye Tho more perhaps to think Id clumb so high I was emboldend from such shown regard To beg &amp; take a kiss as my reward &amp; tho behind her hands she hid her face She only blushd nor frownd at my embrace Richard Force puts no choice their own free will is best What we urge earnest they but take in jest One day while picking sprigs of hillock thyme A little pismire in the flowers did climb That to her bosom proved a rebel guest &amp; stung her as she placed it in her breast Red pimples rose upon the snowy skin &amp; sighs bespoke the anguish it was in But when she showed it me with blushing face I bent with trembling heart &amp; kissed the place Urging the charm as cure for all her pain She smiled as wishing to be kissed again Simon Once in the pasture lane at evenings hours She stoopd adown to reach the brooks flag flowers &amp; sure enough had I not caught her gown Headlong the venturing girl had toppld down &amp; the deep pit where she had nigh fell in It takes the sunday bathers to the chin I held her in my arms till dangers fright Was calmd &amp; then she bade me a good night I woud have kissd her but she said me nay &amp; smiling promisd as she walkd away To dance wi me on the next holiday Richard Once from her choice black lamb I stoopd to pull A bramble that got tazzeld in the wool &amp; prickd my hand she seemd to feel the pain &amp; tryd wi pin to pick it out in vain &amp; sighs the while did her white bosom swell &amp; tear drops startld while she wishd it well Owning she wishd Id let the lambkin be As she had rather it were hurt then me Simon Aye some delights to try a gossips spell &amp; flatterys honey suits some lovers well Ive took her milk full often oer a stile She always thankd me &amp; woud often smile &amp; when shes missd a lamb at morns young light Thinking the fox had stole it off at night Shed mourn &amp; sigh &amp; seek it &amp; enquire When I searchd too oft prickd wi thorn &amp; briar &amp; when she sorrowd tho the lamb was free I might think to[o] that she was grievd for me Richard Thoughts deals in fancys far away from truth &amp; follys shadows shine like suns to youth But reasons proofs are never urgd in vain &amp; what Ive witnessed Ill believe again Once neath this very bridge when left alone I cut my name in full upon the stone Twas weeding time &amp; she was toiling nigh Wi others cutting thistles from the rye &amp; one day coming to the place again When they had been for shelter from the rain I saw her own name in full letters shine Scratchd wi a knife or bodkin close to mine &amp; linkd together wi a trueloves knott Mine lingers still upon the much lovd spot But some rude fool wi envy at his heart Has scratchd hers out &amp; tore the links apart &amp; let them hide loves shadows as they will The heart that wrote is my possesion still I told her of the proof wi anxious pride &amp; tho she ownd it not she near denyd Simon On plough witch monday I was in the barn Tying my bottles up of foddering corn To take afield for sheep that round the stacks Lay wi the small snow winnowing on their backs When in she came wi cheeks as pale as death &amp; scarce coud spake the while for want of breath Keep secrets Sim she said I need them now The witch chaps come &amp; skulkd behind the mow &amp; in they brushd &amp; laughd &amp; stird about Threatning rude kisses if they found her out While I to screen her as she wishd me swore That I had seen her bustle by the door So off they ran &amp; she came smiling out &amp; said she hated to be slaumd about Wi their black faces—but when I began To urge my claims she never shriekd &amp; ran As from a snake or toad—but said the day Was short &amp; labour had no time for play Richard But hark ye Simon thats in seasons gone On last plough monday I myself was one She saw us coming &amp; prepard to flee But oer her shoulder left a laugh on me She hid as one that wishes to be found &amp; while the others lookd the house around I heard the creaking of the dairey door Knowing such secrets by her ways before &amp; instant put her hiding place to rout Nor did she hold the latch to keep me out She might my grizzld face a little dread “Youll spoil my sunday cap” she cringd &amp; said I hopd she woud not take my ways unkind “O no” she laughd “theres water never mind” Simon Some sundays back Id been to fold my sheep Just as the red sun down the woods did creep &amp; looking back while wandering home again I saw a girl come down the pasture lane &amp; slackend pace to pull a wild rose down That she might catch me ere we met the town &amp; turning round again as near she drew Twas marys self who nodded “how do ye do” &amp; joind &amp; chatterd freely by my side Oft turning round my happy dog to chide Who chasd the hares that sat on clover knolls At feed &amp; rabbits squatting by their holes &amp; praisd the black bird at his evening song That in the hedgerow ranted all along His old song “Draw the knave a cup of beer “Be quick quick quick” in chorus plain &amp; clear Such sounds will oft old womens thoughts engage Who mock the tame ones in their wicker cage At length the crossing field of corn came on Were the path only spard a room for one Tho she went first still she woud often turn The unheard answers of our talk to learn &amp; oft as if she wishd it love the while Shed ask me what it was I said &amp; smile Ive oft wishd since Id tryd at ways to woo &amp; gone before to brush the damping dew &amp; tho half shoy &amp; fearful all the while I never urgd to help her oer a stile Shed let me climb them first &amp; make a stand As if she wishd to offer me her hand But I kept backward purposly to prove The self betrayings of my marys love &amp; sure enough all that have eyes may see Thro this the value that she has for me Richard They may indeed &amp; mary in her mirth Woud say a farthing is of kindred worth Last may day eve she spraind her foot at play &amp; when she found she coud no longer stay She came to me &amp; made broad signs the while To lead her home &amp; help her oer each stile Some said she feignd it as excuse to go Be as it woud I near enquird to know But took her arm &amp; went &amp; on our road She many a smile &amp; many a kiss bestowd Till I een fancyd tho I said it not That all was feignd for she her wounds forgot &amp; as she leand to rest agen a stile The pale moon hanging oer her looks the while “Richard” she said &amp; laughd “the moon is new “&amp; I will try if that old tale is true “Which gossips tell who say that if as soon “As any one beholds the new may moon “Bright leaning oer green fields of grass &amp; corn “Slender &amp; crooked like an old rams horn “They oer their eyes a silken kerchief fling “That has been slided thro a wedding ring “As many years as they shall single be “As many moons they thro that blind shall see “&amp; I for once will try the truth I vow “For this that hangs about my bosom now “Was drawn thro one upon a bridal night “When we was full of gossip &amp; delight “Old women if they knew me dot woud call “Me fond &amp; think I wishd the number small “Een you may think me foolish or too free “But be ast will Ill take it off I see” Then instant from her moon gilt neck she threw It first oer me &amp; bade me tell her true &amp; sure as I stand here while that was oer I saw two moons as plain as one before “Bless me” she said &amp; when she put it on She laughd &amp; told me she coud see but one But when I bade her look agen &amp; try She then saw two the very same as I &amp; as the kerchief round her neck she tyd She laughd &amp; said well now Im satisfied Mary I answerd then it rests wi you To suit the tale &amp; make it false or true She took my arm &amp; said I[m] glad to find The new moon proves us both with in a mind This was as plain a hint as she coud say &amp; other proofs were throwing words away Yet she made promises that night to me That next years summer may expect to see When a love nott between us shall be twind As fast as rings &amp; parsons words can bind Simon Ill not believe it tho I own her ways Much more of freedom then I wishd betrays Still her good manners I will keep in mind &amp; near believe that marys so unkind She always thanks me very kind &amp; free For help in toil &amp; thats a proof for me Last live long winter thro for such rewards I cleard the pads from snow about the yards &amp; litterd straw in all the pudgy sloughs About the hovel were she milkd her cows &amp; often milkd when I had time in hand &amp; from the heath brought many a load of sand When ere at plough or muck-cart I have been Her shining rows of pewter plates to clean &amp; oft in summer kept away from church In stead of her the old hens nests to search &amp; slove up from my supper many a day When master at the market was away For her a stolen pear or plumb to reach Or gait of water from the pump to fetch &amp; she has smild &amp; thankd me oer &amp; oer Love proves itself I need not tell no more Yet once while clambering oer the orchard wall I fell &amp; from my pocket in the fall My knife was lost—&amp; mary ever free Found it &amp; offered it as mine to me But I denyd it then that mine was gone On purpose that the maid might keep it on So she no more inquirys card to make &amp; Ill be bound she wishd it for my sake Richard Well tho I had not time to tend her so Or milk her cows or clear her pads of snow Love has no out door charms for winter weather Twas spring &amp; summer when we met together Yet when a chance fell out—at her desire I waited on her at the kitchen fire &amp; often made her evening labour light &amp; took the hugh pot off the hooks at night Brim full of milk the cady calves to feed &amp; soon as chances left no eyes to heed Were soon as ere she thought the job was oer Shed make excuse to meet me at the door In whispering ways shed oer my shoulder lean While I took kisses from my toil unseen Whenever she sat up to bake or brew I slove to help her when no body knew While she woud of her own accord agree To hunt the yard &amp; seek new eggs for me Seeking about when all were safe abed Neath cribs &amp; straw wiout a fear or dread Nor dreaded striding witch or sheated ghost To lap them up in the hot coals to roast Tho shed no cellar key an horn to fill I filld a sweet wort dish &amp; sipt at will Tho she drank none at those late hours of stealth Shed sip &amp; own it was to drink my health &amp; when the summer blossoms ceasd to bloom &amp; time to take the honey up was come When the blue brimstone torch was set alight To smother in ther hives the bees at night When she would call it cruelty &amp; sigh &amp; often take her apron up to cry Yet thought tho troubled oer each murderd bee To save the whitest honeycomb for me &amp; oft shed from her folded apron take Gifts venturing chaps had stolen for her sake &amp; bade me chuse what ere I might prefer &amp; oft to prove I left the chance to her When in a minute shed begin to seek A favourite apple wi the reddest cheek Or plumb that lookd the mellowest—the while Holding them out wi many a sweeter smile &amp; if I fetchd her water from the well Shed slive out too some secret tale to tell Tho the true cause was hid in loves deciet She wishd to hear the hour at eve to meet These are not only proofs of love but speak Things plain as ever one may wish to seek As to the knife there all your hopes must sink Know knives cut love not keep it as you think One that she picked up once you soon may see Such gifts are dangerous so she sold it me So own it if you can Ill that resign But Mary Field flower still I claim as mine Aye Simon lad why turn ye from the view Play wi your watch chain when youve nought to do Look up &amp; answer me or else refrain &amp; own youve lost &amp; well be friends again Aye said the old man wi a sickening smile Whod shut his knife to listen them awhile Poor Simons baffld hopes have stood too long His proofs were seldom right &amp; often wrong His chance is bad I own if all be true So make it up &amp; have no more to do Throw down the foolish love ye long have nurst &amp; done or else the rain will finish first Simon who from their gaze had turnd around &amp; wi his hook progd holes about the ground Whistled his rested dog lapt up asleep &amp; in the rain went seeking up his sheep Glad from a rivals triumph to retreat Yet near acknowledgd that himself was beat While Richard turnd his comrades talk to join &amp; proudly sneerd to see his foe resign Opening of the Pasture—Love &amp; Flattery Within a closes nook beneath a shed Nigh to the stack where stock in winter fed Where black thorn thickets crowded close behind &amp; shielded cows &amp; maidens from the wind Two maidens sat free from the pasture sloughs &amp; told each other as they milked their cows Their evening thoughts of love—while over head The little Wren from its new dwelling fled Who neath the hovels thatch with spring-hopes blest Began to hang &amp; build its curious nest Of hair &amp; feathers &amp; root mosses green It watched about &amp; pickt its feathers clean &amp; cocked its tail &amp; sung its evening strain Then fluttering ventured to its nest again While bluecaps blest the swelling buds to see Repeated their two notes from tree to tree The ass untethered rambling at his ease Knapt the black budding twigs of ashen trees &amp; sheep the green grass champt with greedy bite A certain sign of sudden showers at night The mavis sung aloud &amp; seemed to say Arise my timid love &amp; come away Fear not the cold the winters gone &amp; past &amp; green leaves come to hide our homes at last The woodman humming takes his homeward track With his night faggot bending at his back &amp; in his button hole he gladly bears The firstling primrose that the forrest heirs To show his wife &amp; childern the glad news That spring is hastening with her nursing dews &amp; while the fire light in their faces glowers He tells his forrest tales of birds &amp; flowers Here sat the maids in health &amp; beauty blest Talking of love their leisures common guest The Wren might think them when it tried to sing The two first blossoms of the early spring But when the pastures melted snow was oer Daisey[s] were seen some dozen days before Mary How sweet the lengthening eve begins to come The grass gets green &amp; flowers begin to bloom &amp; birds to build their nests—soon suns will dry The roads that we may set our pattens bye The chirping birds now feel the winter oer Nor longer mope about the threshers door “Pink pink” the bunting says I love the sound It seems to call the daiseys oer the ground Dear heart I love to see the quiet spring Come teaching first the little birds to sing Then loitering in the sunny field &amp; street Like people telling stories when they meet &amp; often pausing in a showers delay As if she feared some danger by the way Sending her herralds forward one by one To try the journey she herself is on Now starts a daisy then a buttercup &amp; then a little primrose trembles up &amp; thus she comes like to a timid maid Of ruffling winds &amp; dirty roads affraid &amp; warm light eves when lovers leisure grows Whole hours to talk &amp; meet in ere they close When Richard will have penned his sheep ere dark &amp; I shall hear his old dogs happy bark As from the heaths furze-hill he hastens down To milk my cows &amp; join me to the town I dearly love the evenings sober hue That from her hazey garments scatters dew While night creeps on by stealth &amp; never shows A track to tell us whence he comes &amp; goes Love in such partings feel[s] more joy then pain That hopes next evening hours to meet again Lucy Well I am sick of plough mens vulgar ways Teazing ones sunday evenings walk with praise Their cuckoo-songs of “ducky” “love” &amp; “dear” So oft repeated sicken me to hear Three grains of common sense they dont possess &amp; they're such down right hobbies in their dress A scarlet waist coat is their common wear Tis ploughmens livery—that I cannot bear &amp; then a ribbon dangles from his hat He thinks himself a down right squire with that I hate such tawdry whims &amp; blockhead taste A gipsey looks much better when hes drest I cannot bear the dirty loves of clowns Sullying ones kerchief &amp; ones sunday gowns Crumpling ones bonnet every now &amp; then To steal a kiss—I hate such clownish men Theyve no more manners then a colt broke loose &amp; no more sense then is a silly goose Bold brazen talk is down right wit with them &amp; gentry with good manners they condemn They call them evil names &amp; stand &amp; laugh Like a rude jack ass &amp; a brawling calf But ask them one plain thing in reasons way They yawn &amp; cough say “hah” or nothing say Commend me to a tinker if you will But these clot hoppers I dislike them still M[ary] Aye scornful Lucy what has Simon done That you his love &amp; all his kind should shun I fear from higher life some dressy beau Has urged your love to scorn poor Simon so Beware of cox combs wench what says the song “Theres mischief lurks beneath a flatterers tongue” A pedlar once ran his door story oer &amp; spread his wares agen our kitchen door Young Farmer Folly passing saw the shews &amp; asked if there was aught that I could chuse Though I chose nought not caring to be free He stoopt &amp; bought this ivory case for me He would have bought a broach but none was left &amp; knife with silver heart upon the heft He took it first then said it would not do As they would cut the closest love in two Then paid the gabbering man &amp; laghed away To every offer I had said him nay But the poor pedlar seeing me afraid Said honour honest callings pretty maid Far do I walk &amp; poorly am I paid &amp; if such rosey cheeks are turned to frown Upon my calling—I am broken down So for pedlars sake &amp; not for his I took the gift nor thought the fault amiss &amp; heres a knitting sheath one carved for me Out of the brown heart of the damsin tree Nor would I give it would it buy the place This simple token for this ivory case L[ucy] Well I see nothing in the shape of pride To put good offers when their met aside The sloe &amp; crab are hedgrows common wear But plumbs &amp; apples gardens only bear &amp; if a fortune finding met my eye Who would be fool to pass it you or I M[ary] For fortunes gifts folk oft wrong names employ As every finder meets not fortunes joy As seeds will vary from the finest tree So beautys baits will often poison be The haughty maid by gazing on the skies May miss the love gift that beneath her lies To turn your back on honesty may show Worse luck at last then passing an odd crow Good fortunes ever found on safest ways Danger lays traps—good fortune nothing lays But honest truth disdaining all disguise &amp; truth tho poor is still esteemed a prize To look for luck to rise above ourselves Is just as vain as if yon man that delves In the wood ditch should look around his toil To turn up buried money with the soil Tis infants only that will pule &amp; cry For flickering stars that spangle in the sky Some trust to moles &amp; dreams—I think it well To link no hope with every idle spell For doubt &amp; sorrow are two dangerous weeds Whose roots strike deep whose flowers shed bitterest seeds —Look heres a mole hid underneath my gown Upon my breast—&amp; shall I double down The fortune boook that tells such spots to be Omens of good or evil unto me &amp; if it speaks of wealth—wealth may not come So who'd deck rooms to make such guests a home Where dissapointments following hopes &amp; fears Is sure to change hopes laughter into tears For pride is always neighbour to consciet &amp; ignorance just makes the thing compleat That looks on beauty as a common toy Which brings to fancy momentary joy That sees it fade &amp; weary with the view Sickens &amp; hankers after somthing new But truth of love will always wear a smile The coarsest jointure &amp; the hardest toil Is ever sweet while theres a friend to share The heavy lot thats fallen to our care But when we stumble on a mirey road &amp; the staff breaks that should have born the load Our lot &amp; life is wear[i]some &amp; we Have the true lot of falsehoods misery —Upon the chimney top wake when I will The morn-watch swallows are “twit tweeing” still &amp; if I rise ere morning opes her eye Theres sure to be a sky lark in the sky Gay natures always laughing—things may die She never goes in mourning where they lie Nor true love ever hath a cause for grief For providence will give to truth relief Unlooked for troubles often may arise But greatest griefs will often whipe their eyes &amp; roughest days find out their journeys end &amp; those most lonely find at last a friend But dissapointment like a worm in may Lives on &amp; nothing drives the grief away L[ucy] Well smiles that with the sunniest pleasures dwell May often meet with sorrows tears as well Yet things I like not shant abuse my feet Ill never run an enemy to meet Bees often labour in a rainy hour &amp; gather honey from a poisonous flower Nor in the sunshine of youths fairy dreams Will I dread shadows where no shadow seems For if you stand at that—whats happiness But half way troubles in a different dress Mere trifling parents of a laugh or smile To cheat our hearts &amp; sooth our hopes awhile Mere sundays left between a working day To catch our breath &amp; give us time to play Most joys beginnings have one tale to tell Whose common ends an heart ach &amp; farewell The kisses pressed upon mere prudish lips May be loves bees that for mock honey sips &amp; emblems oft of the decievers game &amp; just no more of loving but the name For oaths like china ware—a brittle token Tho full as fair are just as easy broken Loves merry sorrows I shall never mind Tho bees have stings &amp; pain is left behind Ill like the sunshine smile on every thing &amp; frown no shadows cause I fear a sting One that is poor mere fortune seldom steals &amp; bonds are safe that warm affection seals A narrow oak plank oer a flood washed stream Looks dismal as a danger in a dream But if we pass safe oer it—never mind The brig &amp; danger both have acted kind &amp; if good fortunes mine Ill use it well &amp; never think Im fallen till Ive fell M[ary] Good fortune comes of merit more then wealth Caution brings both—as medicine brings us health &amp; if we do not look before we leap We may fall headlong down some dizzy steep Indeed we may—&amp; rocks were dangers dwell Lie often pashed to fragments were they fell To prove a person of inferior kind Is only proving of their want of mind By looks the gentleman is poorly told As bad as pinch backs glitter taen for gold Yet [hide] a clown in gold you hide in vain His brazen speech the very gold would stain &amp; pride alone what is it but the fop That stands for somthing when he leaves his shop Yet of so little value with the great —They seem as free as your young mistress Kate —A man on horseback passed me tother night I dropt a courtsey as good manners might He instant touched his hat &amp; made a bow Tho I was dressed as plain as I am now I thought it somthing strange yet nothing knew Till our old hedger down his faggot threw To ask me if I knew him—no said I “Why thats his Lordship—aye it is beguy” I burnt with wonder so I scarce could speak You might have lit a candle in my cheek He took me for my mistress then I said Lords would not make such manners to a maid “Yes yes” said he “how high so ere they be “He shows good manners even unto me[”] —So now I know however some decide Real gentlefolks are never made of pride Such pleasant actions better shows a man Then proud pretending cox comb fooleries can We often throw a stone to ford a stream &amp; try with sticks where deeper places seem —But straws &amp; dust &amp; feathers &amp; such kind Are ever thrown to tell us wheres the wind &amp; proud young fops I still dislike &amp; shun &amp; think it rude tho masters joke in fun “Mary” he'll stand &amp; say “tis somewhat quere “But in my house theres roseys all the year “How is it wench” he'll ask then stand &amp; stare —“Look in the glass &amp; you will find them there[”] &amp; thus he would his vain tomfooleries move &amp; thought I took his poor consciet for love He would with sneering smile my looks extoll &amp; scold the Parrot when it called me “Poll” &amp; oft he'll call me from my work at night To mend his fire &amp; candle fresh to light —&amp; then he needs me not—&amp; there I stand Just like a post with door latch in my hand &amp; then he'll do't himself &amp; joke the while That my fair looks was never made for toil &amp; says tis pity that so fine a face Neer met with favours for a better place I sneak away &amp; blush out right for shame &amp; mutter madness tho I fear to blame Yet he shall never make my weakness win Repenting fondness in the arms of sin The youth tho poor whose memory lives with me Has got a heart of better worth then he One day he pluckt a rosey from the tree Saying Mary heres your sister do you see —I did see compliments had little power To prove love lasting by a withering flower &amp; tother night as I sat on the bench Beside the door he said my “rosey wench” I think you fond of books as well as flowers So here is one to please your leisure hours Twas “Bloomfields Poems” they were sweet indeed He turned a leaf down where he bid me read It was a story called “the broken crutch” “Theres luck” said he “your face might get as much” —I loved the poems &amp; the story too But with the lady I had small to do I owned no face to stir a poets pen While common praise belongs to common men &amp; any wench who stops upon her way May stoop at nothing twenty times a day Twas not my inclination &amp; desire To set my cap at farmer Gent or Squire But Bloomfields Poems theyre so sweet to hear They live with me like neighbours all the year, &amp; when the rooks their nests &amp; noises bring To the tall elm trees at the early spring So true their rapture with the tale agrees I almost see the Hall between the trees &amp; when I cross the plank that strides the brook Oer eastwell green—I even stop to look For Mary Meldrum &amp; the shooting squire So green the story comes my thoughts admire Yet cox combs flatterys can have small pretence To blind the eyes of even common sense To me tis nonsense—not that I pretend To teach another how to chuse a friend Yet truth should guide us all—&amp; proverbs show That truth on falshoods soil can never grow &amp; when proud people condescend to move Their silly praise as make-believes for love Like lanthern in the dark it only shows They idly judge of people by their cloaths &amp; as our eyes are humble look to find The same like failings in a persons mind &amp; having little sense themselves—believe That such low fools are easy to decieve I scorn such poor consciet &amp; all its ways &amp; show proud cox combs how I value praise For he who has such poor contempt of me To think me foolish can no lover be For what are lovers but our dearest friends Truth shows its heart at once &amp; neer pretends We read of servants cast in fortunes way Who bye &amp; bye grow ladys—so they say One swallow makes no spring in worlds so wide All rings are not for weddings till theyre tried &amp; dreams that hope for luck may end in thrall For truth for one no harvest is for all Therefore I look on prides soft words as lies —Praise undeserved is flattery in disguise &amp; Ive seen flattery walk with dog &amp; gun &amp; gilded buttons glittering in the sun &amp; wished it further from my milking way He said “good morn” or tis “a charming day” &amp; often by my cows would talk &amp; smile While his bold dogs would lap the milk the while &amp; scared my cows I could not say “depart” But oft abused the cox comb at my heart Hed ope his box to offer me a pinch But I said “nay” &amp; neer gave way an inch I near was fond of flatterys daubs not I &amp; never heeded to approach so nigh &amp; he would come close bye my side to walk But I still shunned the path nor cared to talk &amp; he would seem anoyed to see me shun His smiles—&amp; instantly uncocked his gun Or “tis not loaded Mary” he would say As if twas that which made me steal away &amp; then more close hed walk down baulk or lane While I as usual sidled off again Till he grew weary with my ways at last &amp; not so much as noticed when he past He'd talk with other girls &amp; said though I Had got a face that might the proof belie Yet I was one of lifes low clownish breed &amp; want of manners made me plain indeed But foolish fop if I had been so vain As with his gay white stockings to be taen I then had manners all &amp; every thing But parsons sanctions &amp; the wedding ring If his be signs for love theyre none for me &amp; “old maid Molly” I would sooner be L[ucy] &amp; none but old maid Mollys past their prime Would wish for winter in the summer time &amp; talk of sermons that are out of date Like an old almanack a year too late Men thats above your station you despise Their manners you make rudeness in disguise &amp; smalls the matter if you reason well They even then the clownish apes excell Who have no sense to keep their rudeness in &amp; no more merit then a crooked pin That soon as bent is took &amp; tossed away &amp; crooked pins are just as good as they I look upon them as a tiresome weed &amp; think their rudeness very rude indeed &amp; yet I laugh at every thing they say But wear deaf ears where rudeness breaks away &amp; if good fortune should my suit commend Mind that Id chuse no bumpkin for a friend No more then nettles should engage my eye In pleasant gardens when a rose was bye M[ary] Well you may chuse your garden flowers &amp; take The rose but chuse it for its sweetness sake Hope quickly fades beneath a broken pledge &amp; Ive seen sweeter roses on the hedge Hedge briars will often make the fingers smart But finer ones will prick you to the heart —One evening when I went to milk my cows Some mischief seeking boys with sticks &amp; boughs Had teazed a whasps nest in the pasture grass Close to the foot path which I had to pass &amp; as one came &amp; buzzed about my face I dropt my pails &amp; hurried from the place Nor dare I venture nigh so chilled with fright But stopt for Richard till he past at night When in the mean time who should cross the brig Tapping his boot tops with a switching twig But Mr Pride—he gave his head a bow Saying “heigh ho Mary whats the matter now” &amp; when I told him he proposed a scheme To stay till night when he would go &amp; team A brimming pail of water on the nest &amp; drown them all—but I declined the test Twas just to prove if hed a fool in me To stay till sun down that he might be free —Ive read in books that such are nothing nice &amp; look on girls as purchase at a price —Tis pity that distinctions so confounds That flimsy paper marked with many pounds Should make its rude possessors gentlemen &amp; give them lisence but with tongue &amp; pen To deal out mischief at their idle will &amp; ruin maids—yet men of honour still While men with nothing but an honest fame Who leave the world as poor as when they came By having nothing bear all sorts of scorn &amp; stand in prides way like a worthless thorn Worth stands for nought where moneys worth stands first &amp; poorer folks are sure to be the worst While wealthy cox combs—O it so provokes I hate to seet—are always gentle folks —There while I stood as I was forced to stay Pride sauntered too &amp; would not go away Holding his snuff box out with sneering smile Nor offered once to fetch the pail the while His dogs came round me &amp; I feigned a fear To sidle from him as he chattered near Poor things it grieved me when he whipt them round &amp; made them howl &amp; lye upon the ground Swearing “such freedom he would neer alow “So Mary stop they will not hurt you now” I felt alarmed—but Richard crossed the lane &amp; glad I started off to meet the swain When he came up &amp; twitched me by the gown &amp; said I hope your lovers not a clown Indeed he is said I &amp; [Ill] request The mans assistance I esteem the best When off the cox comb went &amp; tossed his head &amp; muttered somthing I was vulgar bred Well never mind if rudeness keeps me free From such like fops ill manners let it be The girls he ruined witnessed in their shame His empty praise deserved a worser name &amp; though the fellow is by fortune fed Lucks purse is maybe longer then his head &amp; is pride so preferred with lucks pretence To honest clowns &amp; truth &amp; commonsensePeterborough MS. A 50, pp. 15–16 contains the following passage which was omitted from the final version in Peterborough MS. B 8, it is not clear whether accidentally or deliberately. It belongs between lines 461 and 462 of the text, and constitutes the final speech by Lucy; we give it here since it provides a resolution to the debate which is otherwise lacking. Well as a weathercock agen the wind Your lessons make me of a wavering mind &amp; somthing in my bosom would be fain To call poor Simon to its rest again His plain way never can be loves disguise To fawn &amp; flatter with new hatching lies Though his best dress is but a russet brown &amp; hat that time has robbed of beavers down His plain hearts like a Gem in meaner case I cannot put a better in its place &amp; now the cows are milked &amp; night agen Leaves free the hovel to the little Wren The maidens both the simmering brook hath past Where more stones lie then when they left it last &amp; Marys expectations smiled to see Her lover waiting neath the maple tree So loves discourse had end—till eve again Should call them both to milk upon the plain Pastoral 2??—Jealousy Loud lowed the happy cows with udders full To hear the gingling yokes &amp; shrill cum mull From the two maidens by the hovel side Who came agen to milk with eventide The little wren scared at each sudden guest Let drop the feather gathered for his nest &amp; in the black thorn sat awhile &amp; then Flew down &amp; pickt the feather up agen &amp; fluttered round till maidens turned their heads Then popt into his nest &amp; went to bed The maids resumed their love discourse anew Half hid by thistles that around them grew For love is beautys legacy by kind The grace &amp; harmony of womans mind For in that soul where no affections spring Beautys vain boast is but a souless thing Mary Well Lucy heres the thistle by our side Shows how weak blossoms may be stung by pride See how it taunts its head with nought to fear The very cows seem loath to venture near But heres these daiseys—o so low they spring They seem to fear the little tiniest thing Heres one crushed here beneath old Collys tread The dews seem tears for very anguish shed So have I thought when tracking mornings dew &amp; Ive smiled too to see it smile anew &amp; so it is with maids like you &amp; I Who go beyond themselves &amp; look too high Theyre sure to stumble ere the journeys oer Brused like the flower &amp; may be bloom no more [Lucy] Your hints are easy understood but still They make a mountain of a little hill —As to these daiseys crushed by cows—they lie Mid common things beneath the open skie While neath this thistle—cut your troubles short Heres many blooms &amp; not a daisy hurt So turn you[r] idle fancies out of doors If wealths bad luck—what is it to be poor Mary Some have met fortune in a masters house &amp; in an honest suitor fo[u]nd a spouse Who proud of worth deckt humbleness in silk To make them mistress of the cows they milk —&amp; though chance says such chances still may be For one in favour theres against it three Some have found golden findings at a fair Some in old ruins met with money there &amp; some may seek a life time out in vain Nor find a farthings profit as their gain So some in blindfold accident may meet By love &amp; marriage fortune at their feet While others trusting far &amp; hoping all Instead of rising into ruin fall —Well call your cows—I feel we yet are friends If your offended may be truth offends L[ucy] Nay mary nay I am not vext a jot But your own foibles have you all forgot Last may I heard you say—“the vulgar set” Where none but ploughmen ro[u]nd the garland met &amp; even yester night did I not see You scorn the hobnail clowns as well as me Who at their idle praise no notice took &amp; when they reached your kerchief from the brook Which the unmannered winds had flirted in You valued all their kindness not a pin &amp; when they said “here Mary” turned aside You was not deaf what could it be but pride &amp; then kind Simon whose good natured ways Might win a ladys tongue to speak his praise Did you not scorn him upon may day morn M[ary] No Lucy no I did not Simon scorn &amp; as for clowns they are not so by dress Tis down right ignorance &amp; nothing less That makes the clown &amp; if I turned away Twas from their praises which they pleased to pay Me for the trouble they themselves had taen To thank them Lucy manners were in vain Had I been free they then had lost their fears &amp; words had come illsuiting womans ears Pride some may call it—tis no matter what You shun low fellows when you notice not For time keeps growing more &amp; more the clown Wearing to rags like memorys wedding gown When she &amp; summer married merry may &amp; la[u]ghed till autumn drove the bride away For all the praise that wont our tastes to hit Weve lowlived jests fools best mistakes for wit These in our paths &amp; pastures ever come &amp; maidens fears must leave their ears at home A strangers speech gives womans heart alarms &amp; well meant manners seem intended harms This I alow but follys no disguise Which any one may know &amp; shut her eyes But as to Simon you as well might bring Proofs that I scorn the song I cannot sing As friend &amp; partner of our evening game Im proud to own him &amp; should feel a shame To say I scorned one of such gentle ways Who wins far better folks to speak his praise The songs he makes I dearly love to hear &amp; only shun when meddlers interfere How can I help when people make so free But blush to hear his songs were made on me —Tis not for me to read mans smiles or sighs Yet if he loves me tis in this disguise For never when alone or in a crowd His love escaped him whispered or alowed For let me tell you I too have my pride Station can make no gentleman nor hide True worth from reason—had he spoke in time This let me say I had not called it crime In one to praise me who so well can praise Yet he too flatters so my reason says For in the ballads which the shepherds sing In pasture huts &amp; by the bubbling spring His milkmaids show like ladys in such scenes &amp; if he sings of us he makes us queens His praise of humble life can hardly mean Yet nought but humble life himself hath seen &amp; if tis flattery who can think it wrongs That makes when read or sung such pleasant songs True when that song was sung in which he says So much of Marys beauty &amp; her praise I could not think to let him bear the blame Of praising me—so I denied the name &amp; if I did could I offend him less I only save his trouble to confess For if all rumours right &amp; none are wrong He courts full twenty girls in every song [Lucy] Last valentine you know a letter came Inscribed to Mary—you denied the name &amp; said that many owned that name indeed &amp; I knew that—you too can write &amp; read &amp; they who can do neither might know more Twas meant for them who found it at their door Yet you already won by clowns—in pride Disda[i]ned to read &amp; cast the thing aside &amp; when we praised the verses that was read You blushed with scornful shame &amp; nothing said &amp; tore it up no doubt as many tear Their lovers letters when they curl their hair [Mary] No though the praises cant belong to me Tis now as near my heart as truth can be For next my bosom in my hussiff case (&amp; love has christened that its dearest place) I keep it—nay believe me look tis here The very same Ill read &amp; you shall hear Mary thou muse of all my simple themes Thou fairey sunshine of youths summer dreams When young love sped upon its happy race So swift that thought could scarcely keep him pace Again I wooe thee with the voice of ryhme &amp; idly linger oer that witching time When in thy sight I felt above the blest &amp; my soul trembled where that kiss was prest The very winds that [passed] where thou didst dwell &amp; clouds slow moving oer that happy dell Where charged with idle messages of sighs &amp; anxious wishes of my gazing eyes When e'er thou wandered out at sabbaths hour My heart grew jealous of each happy flower I thought they crowded in the pleasant ways To woo thy beauty &amp; to win thy praise I thought the folding star with eager climb Gaind evening[s] twilight arch before her time &amp; moons more soon then they were wont to be Shone out on purpose to be joined by thee How warmed my hopes oer each imagined smile Interpreted to omens all the while As self imagined favours meant for me Till the heart ached for joy—&amp; all for thee Favours are sweetest joys of lovers toils Who see their only happiness in smiles With the[e] earths every trouble vanished bye &amp; not one cloud soiled loves illumined sky As when the full moon sheds its proudest ray Night shrinks abashed &amp; startles into day Thy beauty in my dreams doth joys instill It ever blest me &amp; it ever will Serene as glides the gentle brook away Neath the soft twilight of a summers day Thy timid fondness led to no extreems But joys as innoscent as infants dreams I thought thy face so beautiful &amp; shy That care would never let thee weep or sigh &amp; still thou dost thy maiden sabbath keep Nor sin hath never gave thee cause to weep Thou art too fair &amp; beautiful for sin With angels charms it cannot claim akin Thou haven of my hopes when ere I see That lovely face the storm is past with me Thoughts of thy memory glideth in my mind Forever &amp; no failings eer could find Thy young rich beauty gilt lifes early hour Like sudden birth of an unlooked for flower Nature exulting placed its motto there “This work is mine &amp; where is ought so fair” Young hope looked on &amp; did in rapture move &amp; owned the earnest of delight was love Thy lips were like twin roses which the morn Kisses &amp; leaves its dewy pearls thereon Yet still as virgin flowers unstained &amp; free From the bold freedom of the amorous bee Smiles hung about them as if loath to give Room to a frown to bid hope cease to live While thy young bosom at the praise it heard Heaved up &amp; panted like a timid bird Thy face would win a world to be thy friend For beautys silence will its suit commend Thy lovely looks owned raptures sweetest thrill That words can neither paint or praise but ill O I have gazed with wonder on those eyes &amp; paid thee angel worship in disguise &amp; often thought thou wert how beautiful &amp; felt without thee gayest scenes how dull &amp; praised thee in my heart ten thousand times In unfeignd fancies &amp; unflattered ryhmes Yet my heart neer so far forgot its fear To breath it loudly in thy timid ear I feared the truth that out of sight did shroud Would seem but flattery if I spoke it loud &amp; only from the boon such days alow I had not written what Ive told thee now So with the sanction of St Valentine For one day only let me call thee mine &amp; then like flower pots when their blooms decay To morrow throw the worthless ryhmes away That is the letter read it if you will He bids me burn it but I keep it still Yet dare I say such praise belongs to me For if I did how foolish should I be &amp; praise so high—but muttered in a crowd Would make me look more foolish then the proud &amp; as to beaus can I my self divide I have not got a heart on either side In friendships way he stands the first of all But only one as lover I can call The maid whose beauty many eyes hath won May out of many sweethearts meet with none [Lucy] What not in love wheres reason to deny Last valentine who saw you read but I The prayer book—aye you blush &amp; well you may For when I looked you put the book away I wondered—&amp; nowonder almost stares When people seem ashamed to read their prayers So when your back was turned I went to look Beyond excuses—though you shut the book This mark dropt out compare it with your gown &amp; where folks marry—leaves was doubled down Tis all as plain as print beyond a guess Nor can your best denials make it less For love &amp; marriage if our thoughts incline Are pleasant prayers to read at valentine &amp; if young maidens think so wheres the harm But Simon was the spell that worked the charm [Mary] Well now I see you're jealous—&amp; must I To please ones fancies throw all pleasure bye &amp; when May plays at “crookhorn” saunter near &amp; bite my thumbs anothers frowns to fear &amp; hunt the slipper cant I merry be Without the whisper urged &amp; cast at me The Prayer books self no matter where I read Could surely stir no fancies in your head &amp; jokes about such books are far from wise Truth love &amp; prayer from the same bosom rise No matter how such things are understood Prayers are not prayers unless our thoughts are good Nor had you heeded thoughts you fancied mine Nor filled your head so long with valentine Had not some other cause below the rest Lay there consealed—the matter may be guest Tis when I meet old friends in field &amp; town &amp; laugh &amp; talk that makes another frown To please all tastes we might ourselves denie Of daylight &amp; go blind fold neath the sky Thank day my eyes are good—the springs begun &amp; Ill not shut them for I love the sun Unless when at the Blindmans bluff we play At may day eve or when weve got the hay &amp; ere one blind fold man mistakes the prize Ill pull myself the kerchief from his eyes So that no maiden may have room to say She had one cause to frown on such a day Lucy Yes Mary certain favours will prevail Whose cow deserved a mawkin at her tail But yours when last &amp; yet no shaming thorn Betrayed the Sluggabed that lay till morn &amp; Simon who pretends his love to me By doing favours—I can easy see He was of all the rest the only cause That broke for you last year the pasture laws You got the garland—twas a shameful sin That the last comer should a garland win I almost hated Simon in my spite Well Lucy well I know that right is right Said he but who could have the heart to trail A dangling thorn at poor old Collys tail Though she was last—you was not first—yet friends Should make a stranger to the place amends &amp; shes so fair that milks old Colly now I could not tie a mawkin to her cow —He called you but his friend—pretence to prove Where friendship went there was not room for love But yet the shepherd shows more pleasant ways He made a busk &amp; flowered it for your stays &amp; begged the old one which your play did break Not for a pattern only—but your sake</field>
