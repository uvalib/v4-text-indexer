      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. Minerva's Descent to Ithaca. The Poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remain'd seven years in the island of Calypso, when the Gods assembled in council proposed the method of his departure from thence, and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mentes King of the Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his Father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reign'd: then after having visibly display'd her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. We shall proceed in the same method thro' the course of these Annotations upon the Odyssey, as in those upon the Iliad; considering Homer chiefly as a Poet, endeavouring to make his beauties understood, and not to praise without a reason given. It is equally an extreme, on the one hand to think Homer has no human defects; and on the other to dwell so much upon those defects, as to depreciate his beauties. The greater part of Criticks form a general character, from the observation of particular errors, taken in their own oblique or imperfect views; which is as unjust, as to make a judgment of the beauty of a man's body from the shadow it happens to cast, in such or such a position. To convince the Reader of this intended impartiality, we readily allow the Odyssey to be inferior to the Iliad in many respects. It has not that sublimity of spirit, or that enthusiasm of poetry; but then it must be allow'd, if it be less noble, it is more instructive: The other abounds with more Heroism, this with more Morality. The Iliad gives us a draught of Gods and Heroes, of discord, of contentions, and scenes of slaughter; the Odyssey sets before us a scene more amiable, the landschapes of nature, the pleasures of private life, the duties of every station, the hospitality of ancient times; a less busy, but more agreeable portrait. The Iliad concludes with the ruin, the Odyssey with the happiness of a nation. Horace was of the same opinion, as is evident from the epistle to Lollius. Seditione, dolis, scelere, libidine, &amp; ira, Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra. Rursus, quid virtus &amp; quid sapientia possit, Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulyssem. The Man, for Wisdom's Homer opens his Poem with the utmost simplicity and modesty; he continually grows upon the reader. Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat. Cicero lays this down as a rule for the Orator, principia verecunda, non elatis intensa verbis; and Horace for the Poet, Nec sic incipies, &amp;c. He proposes the beginning of the Odyssey as a pattern for all future poems, and has translated them in his Art of poetry. Dic mihi, Musa, virum, captæ post tempora Trojæ, Qui mores hominum multorum vidit; &amp; urbes. May I be forgiven the arrogance, if I should offer a criticism upon this translation? The sufferings of Ulysses are the subject of the whole Odyssey, and yet Horace has omitted the mention of those sufferings: ?? ???? ????? ???????. There is another word also which seems essential, that is, ??????????, this is likewise omitted. For the sufferings of Ulysses, and the wisdom by which he extricated himself from them, enter into the very design of the Poem. But indeed in another place he has plainly had regard to all these circumstances, Qui domitor Trojæ, multorum providus urbes Et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per æquor Dum sibi, dum sociis, reditum parat, aspera multa Pertulit ? Epist. ad Loll. I must also refute a criticism of Rapin, who will have it that the word ?????????? includes a character of craft and low cunning, unworthy of a brave spirit: But Eustathius admirably vindicates the Poet in this respect, he shews us that ?????? no where in Homer signifies (???) or Morals; and that it implies a man who could accommodate himself to every condition of life; one who in the worst estate had still a reserve to free himself from it; it therefore, says he, signifies a man that thro' experience has learn'd wisdom. I have likewise the authority of Horace for this sense, in the above-cited passage, Qui domitor Trojæ, multorum providus urbes. I take providus in this place to signify not only a man who noted the manners of various nations with care, but also one who in calamity could foresee methods to extricate himself from it. And surely nothing can be more unjust than what Rapin objects against Ulysses, in employing his wisdom only in his own preservation, while all his companions were lost: Homer himself sufficiently refutes this objection, and directly tells us, that he employed his wisdom in the care of their safety, but that they thro' their folly defeated his wisdom. The words of Homer, says Eustathius, shew that a wise man neglects not his friends in adversity. But, says Rapin, what could oblige Homer to begin with so dishonourable an action, and place the greatest weakness of his Hero in the very frontispiece of his Poem? and invoke his Muse to sing the man who with difficulty saved himself, and suffer'd his companions to be destroy'd? There had been some weight in this objection, if Ulysses had saved his own, with the loss of their lives; but I cannot see any dishonour, in his preserving himself by wisdom, when they destroy'd themselves by folly: It was chiefly by storms that they perish'd; it can be no imputation to his character, not to be able to restrain the effects of a tempest: he did all that a wise man cou'd do, he gave them such admonitions upon every emergency, that if they had pursued them, they had been preserved as well as Ulysses. various arts renown'd, Bossu's's observation in relation to this Epithet ??????????, given to Ulysses, is worth transcribing. The Fable of the Odyssey (says he) is wholly for the conduct and policy of a State: Therefore the quality it requires is Wisdom, but this virtue is of too large an extent for the simplicity which a just and precise character requires; it is therefore requisite it should be limited. The great art of Kings is the mystery of Dissimulation. 'Tis well known, that Lewis the eleventh, for the instruction of his Son, reduc'd all the Latin language to these words only, viz. Qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare. 'Twas likewise by this practice that Saul began his reign, when he was first elected and as yet full of the spirit of God. The first thing we read of him in holy Writ is, Ille vero dissimulabat se andire. Reg. lib. 1. that he made as if he did not hear the words which seditious people spoke against him. This then is the character which the Greek Poet gives his Ulysses in the Proposition of his Poem, he calls him ????? ??????????; to denote this prudent dissimulation, which disguised him so many ways, and put him upon taking so many shapes. Without mentioning any thing of Circe, who detain'd him with her a whole year, and who was famous for the transformations she made of all sorts of persons; the reader finds him at first with Calypso the daughter of wise Atlas, who bore up the vast pillars that reach'd from Earth to Heaven, and whose knowledge penetrated into the depths of the unfathomable Ocean: that is to say, who was ignorant of nothing in Heaven, Earth, or Sea. And as the first product and principal part of so high, so solid, and so profound a knowledge was to know how to conceal one's self; this wise man call'd his daughter by a name that signified a ????????? secret. The Poet makes his Hero, whom he deab for a Politician, to stay seven whole years with this Nymph. She taught him so well, that afterwards he lost no opportunity of putting her lessons in practice: for he does nothing without a disguise. At his parting from Ogygia he is cast upon the Isle of Phæacia: as kind as his reception was, yet he stays 'till the night before he went off e're he wou'd discover himself. From thence he goes to Ithaca: the first adventure that happen'd to him there was with Minerva, the most prudent among the Deities, as Ulysses was the most prudent among men. She says so expressly in that very passage. Nor did they fail to disguise themselves. Minerva takes upon her the shape of a shepherd, and Ulysses tells her he was oblig'd to fly from Crete, because he had murder'd the son of King Idomeneus. The Goddess discovers her self first, and commends him particularly, because these artifices were so easy and natural to him, that they seem'd to be born with him. Afterwards the Hero under the form of a beggar deceives first of all Eumeus, then his son, and last of all his wife, and every body else, till he found an opportunity of punishing his Enemies, to whom he discover'd not himself 'till he kill'd them, namely on the last night. After his discovering himself in the Palace, he goes the next day to deceive his father, appearing at first under a borrow'd name; before he wou'd give him joy of his return. Thus he takes upon him all manner of shapes, and dissembles to the very last. But the Poet joins to this character a valour and a constancy which render him invincible in the most daring and desperate adventures. Long exercis'd in woes, oh Muse! resound. Who, when his arms had wrought the destin'd fall Whence is it that Ulysses is said to have overthrown Troy? and not Achilles, who was of more remarkable courage than Ulysses? Eustathius tells us, that the destruction of Troy ought to be ascribed chiefly to Ulysses, as he not only took away the Palladium, but was the inventor of the stratagem of the wooden horse, by which that city was conquer'd. Virgil in his second book of the Æneis gives a noble description of its destruction, by which we find that Ulysses was not only the contriver of its ruin, but bore a great share in the actions of the night in which that City was overturn'd. Of sacred Troy, and raz'd her heav'n-built wall, Wand'ring from clime to clime, observant stray'd, Their Manners noted, and their States survey'd. On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dar'd to prey By this single trait, Homer marks an essential difference between the Iliad and the Odyssey: namely, that in the former Poem the people perish'd by the folly of their Kings: Quicquid delirunt reges, plectuntur Achivi. In this, the people perish by their own folly, while their Prince omits nothing to procure their felicity. A plain reason why the Odyssey is more calculated for the People, than the Iliad. Dacier. On Herds devoted to the God of Day; The God vindictive doom'd them never more (Ah men unbless'd!) to touch that natal shore. Oh snatch some portion of these acts from fate, It may be ask'd why the Poet invokes the Muse to recount only Part of the sufferings of Ulysses? and why those words, To Us also, are inserted? To the first it may be answer'd, that an heroic Poem dwells chiefly upon incidents of importance, and passes over every thing that does not contribute to raise our idea of the Hero, or to the main design of the Poem: To the other Eustathius answers several ways; either, says he, the word ??? is to be taken as an expletive, as it is in a thousand places in Homer; or it means that this is a subject so considerable, that it will be a theme to many Poets: or that being a true History it had spread over many nations of the world, and that Homer himself received the story of the Poem from Ægypt; and then the meaning will be, “Sing, oh Muse, to the Greeks as well as to other nations, the sufferings of Ulysses.” I should prefer the first as being the most natural: the rest seem forced, and consequently improper for the opening of a Poem, where the utmost plainness is necessary; especially, if we consider that Ulysses was a Grecian, and it is not probable that the Grecians should be the least acquainted with the story, or the latest to celebrate the actions, of a Grecian. Celestial Muse! and to our world relate. Now at their native realms the Greeks arriv'd; It is necessary for the better understanding of the Poem, to fix the period of Time from which it takes its beginning: Homer, as Eustathius observes, does not begin with the wandrings of Ulysses, he steps at once into the latter end of his actions, and leaves the preceding story to be told by way of narration. Thus in his Iliad, he dates his Poem from the anger of Achilles, which happen'd almost at the conclusion of the Trojan war. From hence Horace drew his observation in his Arte Poet. Semper ad eventum festinat; &amp; in medias res, Non secus as notas, auditorem rapit. There are but forty eight days from the departure of Ulysses from Calypso, to his discovery in Ithaca; he had been one year with Circe, and seven with Calypso, when the Gods dispatched Mercury to that Goddess; from which point of Time we are to date the Odyssey. This observation gives a reason why the Poet invokes the Muse to recount the wandrings of this Hero in part only; for Ulysses, as appears from the beginning of the ninth book, after he left the shores of Troy, was driven to Ismarus of the Ciconians. An Historian must have begun from the fall of Troy, and related his wandrings with truth and order; for History is chiefly for instruction: But a Poet takes another method, and disposes every circumstance arbitrarily; he chuses or rejects, as suits best with his principal design, and in such a manner as to give at once delight and instruction. All who the Wars of ten long years surviv'd, And 'scap'd the perils of the gulfy Main. Ulysses, sole of all the victor train, An exile from his dear paternal coast, Deplor'd his absent Queen, and Empire lost. Calypso in her caves constrain'd his stay, To the Remark before cited of Bossu, upon the abode of Ulysses with Calypso, may be added this of the Abbé Fraguier: that his residing seven years in the caves of Calypso, (the Goddess of Secrecy) may only mean that he remain'd so long hid from the knowledge and enquiry of all men; or that whatever befel him in all that time was lost to History, or made no part in the Poem. With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay: In vain—for now the circling years disclose The day predestin'd to reward his woes. At length his Ithaca is giv'n by Fate, Where yet new labours his arrival wait; At length their rage the hostile Pow'rs restrain, All but the ruthless Monarch of the Main. It may be ask'd why Neptune is thus enraged against Ulysses? Homer himself tells us, it was because that Hero had put out the eye of his son Cyclops. But if we take Neptune by way of Allegory for the Ocean, the passage implies, that the sufferings of Ulysses were chiefly by sea; and therefore Poetry, which adds a grandeur to the meanest circumstance, introduces the God of it as his greatest enemy. Eustathius. But now the God, remote, a heav'nly guest In Æthiopia grac'd the genial feast, Strabo in his first book delivers his opinion, that “the ancient Grecians included all those people who lived upon the southern Ocean, from east to west, in the general name of Æthiopians, and that it was not confined to those only who lay fouth of Ægypt.” Ptolomy says, that “under the Zodiac, from east to west, inhabit the Æthiopians, black of colour.” And elsewhere the same Geographer divides Æthiopia into the eastern and the western. These eastern and western Æthiopians were separated by the Arabian or Ægyptian Gulf; which tho' never mention'd by Homer, as Aristarchus remark'd, yet it is not probable (says Strabo) that he should be ignorant of it, it being but a thousand stadia distant from the Mediterranean, when he knew the Ægyptian Thebes, which was four times as far off. Strab. Plin. Spondan. I will not repeat what was observ'd upon the Gods being gone to the Æthiopians, in the first book of the Iliad; 'tis sufficient in general to observe, that the Æthiopians were a people very religious towards the Gods, and that they held a pompous feast twelve days annually to their honour; and in particular, that the Poet very judiciously makes use of this solemnity to remove Neptune out of the way, who was the enemy of Ulysses, that he may with the greater security bring off his Hero from Calypso's Island. Eustathius. (A race divided, whom with sloping rays The rising and descending Sun surveys) There on the world's extreamest verge rever'd, With Hecatombs and pray'r in pomp prefer'd, Distant he lay: while in the bright abodes Of high Olympus, Jove conven'd the Gods: Th'assembly thus the Sire supreme addrest, Ægysthus' fate revolving in his breast, Whom young Orestes to the dreary coast Of Pluto sent, a blood-polluted Ghost. Perverse Mankind! whose Wills, created free, The solemnity and sententiousness of this speech is taken notice of by Eustathius; and surely Poetry must be highly valuable, when it delivers such excellent instructions. It contain'd the whole of religion amongst the antients; and made Philosophy more agreeable. This passage is an instance of it, a passage worthy of a Christian; it shews us that the Supreme Being is sovereignly good; that he rewards the just, and punishes the unjust; and that the folly of man, and not the decree of Heaven, is the cause of human calamity. Charge all their woes on absolute Decree; All to the dooming Gods their guilt translate, And Follies are miscall'd the crimes of Fate. When to his lust Ægysthus gave the rein, It is difficult to find a reason why, in the original, Jupiter shou'd give such an honourable appellation to Ægysthus, as ????????, unblameable, who had dishonoured the bed of Agamemnon, and taken his life away; especially in that very instant when he condemns the fact with so great solemnity: Eustathius says, that Homer, an enemy to censure and invective, introduces that God as having respect only to his good qualities, and commending him for his general character; and adds that it had been an indecency in the Poet to have given countenance to that base custom by the authority of Jupiter. Dacier is not satisfy'd with this reason, and tells us, that Homer gives Ægysthus this title, to vindicate Jupiter from the imputation of his crimes: He gives us to understand that Heaven is not the cause of man's failings; that he is by Creation able to act virtuously, and that it is thro' his own misconduct that he deviates into evil; and therefore the meaning is this; “Jupiter calling to mind Ægysthus, that Ægysthus whom he had created wise and virtuous, and made capable to sustain that character.” And this agrees admirably with the beginning of the speech of Jupiter, who there vindicates his own Divinity. But if this shou'd seem too refin'd, it may be sufficient to take the word in that good sense which Ægysthus might have deserved for many good qualities: Thus Achilles is call'd the swift of foot, even while he stands, or sleeps; the first being his general character. It may be further confirm'd by a passage something resembling it in the holy Scriptures: The Ægyptian Midwives were guilty of a lye to Pharaoh, and yet God pardons it, and blesses them: He blesses them not because they lyed, but because they preserv'd the children of the Israelites. Did Fate, or we, th'adult'rous act constrain? Did Fate, or we, when great Atrides dy'd, Urge the bold traitor to the Regicide? Hermes I sent, while yet his soul remain'd It would be endless to observe every moral passage in the Odyssey, the whole of it being but one lesson of Morality. But surely it must be a pleasure to the Reader to learn what notions the antients had of a Deity, from the oldest book extant, except the book of Moses. Jupiter here declares that he never fails to warn mankind from evil, and that he had sent by Mercury for this purpose to Ægysthus. It may be ask'd what is this Mercury whom Jupiter sends? It is the light of Nature, which Heaven implants in the breast of every man: and which, as Cicero says, is not only more ancient than the world, but co-eval with the Master of the world himself. He writes to this effect. There was from the beginning such a thing as Reason, a direct emanation from Nature it self, which prompted to good, and averted from evil. A Reason which did not then become a law, when it was first reduced to writing, but was so even from the moment it existed, and it existed from ever, of an equal date with the divine Intelligence: It is the true and primordial Law, proper to command and to forbid, it is the Reason of the great Jupiter. That Reason of the supreme Being, is here call'd Mercury; that Reason flowing from God, which is constantly dictating to the most corrupted hearts, this is good, or, this is evil. Hence arose an ancient Proverb, recorded by Simplicius, Reason is a Mercury to all men. Epictetus [lib. 3. Arrian.] says, Apollo knew that Laius would not obey his Oracle. Apollo nevertheless did not neglect to prophecy to Laius those evils that threaten'd him. The goodness of the Divinity never fails to advertise mankind; that source of truth is ever open and free: but men are ever incredulous, disobedient and rebellious. Dacier. Sincere from royal blood, and faith profan'd; To warn the wretch, that young Orestes grown To manly years shou'd re-assert the throne. Yet impotent of mind, and uncontrol'd, He plung'd into the gulf which Heav'n foretold. Here paus'd the God, and pensive thus replies Minerva graceful with her azure eyes. O thou! from whom the whole creation springs, It may be ask'd what relation Ulysses has to Ægysthus, that the mention of the one should immediately give occasion for the remembrance of the other? and it may appear unnatural in the Poet to give rise to his Poem by so unexpected a transition from Ægysthus to Ulysses. Eustathius vindicates Homer, by shewing that it is not only beautiful but natural, to take rise from what offers it self to our immediate observation. What can be more natural, when Jupiter is relating how he punishes the wicked, than for Wisdom or Minerva to suggest, that the good ought to be rewarded? There is no forced introduction; no artful preparation, but the whole arises from the occasion, which is a great beauty. Eustathius. The source of pow'r on earth deriv'd to Kings! His death was equal to the direful deed; So may the Man of blood be doom'd to bleed! But grief and rage alternate wound my breast For brave Ulysses, still by fate opprest. Amidst an Isle, around whose rocky shore There was, according to true History, such an Island of Calypso, of which Strabo writes; that Solon gives an account of the Island Atlantis bordering upon Ægypt, and that he went thither to make enquiry, and learn'd that an Island was once there, but by time was vanished. Eustathius. The forests murmur, and the surges roar, The blameless hero from his wish'd-for home A Goddess guards in her enchanted dome. (Atlas her sire, to whose far-piercing eye Atlas is here said to understand all the depths of the Sea: but the Epithet ?????????? apply'd to him, has two different significations. It implies either, one whose thoughts are full of terrible and dismal things, or, one who has infinite knowledge and unbounded views, and 'tis doubtful which of them Homer means. To reconcile both, may we not think our Author had heard something of the ancient tradition which makes Atlas the same person with Enoch, and represents him as a great Astronomer, who prophecy'd of the universal deluge, and exhorted mankind to repentance? Therefore he nam'd his son Methuselah, to shew that after his death the waters shou'd overspread the face of the earth. His continual lamentations on this occasion caus'd him to be call'd the Weeper; for the world is always an enemy to melancholy predictions. Thus Homer upon the credit of this Tradition might very well call Atlas, one whose thoughts ran upon dismal things, or one whose views and cares were vastly extended. I insist no otherwise upon this but as a conjecture, yet it is further strengthen'd by what follows in the next lines: That Atlas sustains those Columns which being fixed upon the earth support the Heavens. This is generally interpreted of his great skill in Astronomy and Geography. But may not the reason be more particular? Since Atlas or Enoch had prophecy'd of the Deluge, and since that prediction was looked upon as the effect of his skill in Astronomy; might it not be said he knew the abysses of the Sea, and sustain'd the pillars of Heaven, to express that he knew how the fountains of the deep and the waters above the Heavens shou'd unite to drown the earth? As to the image of the pillars of Heaven, it is frequent in the sacred books, and used to express the height of vast mountains. (Pindar calls Ætna the ???????? ?????:) and there might probably be something more particular that furnished Homer with this idea; I mean the pillars of Hercules, well-known in his time, and neighbouring to the mountain he describes. Dacier. See the description of this mountain in the 4?? book of Virgil, where the same image is preserv'd without any hint of allegory: As indeed it is no more than a poetical manner of expressing the great height and extensive prospect of the mountain. The wonders of the Deep expanded lye; Th'eternal columns which on earth he rears End in the starry vault, and prop the spheres.) By his fair daughter is the chief confin'd, Who sooths to dear delight his anxious mind: Successless all her soft caresses prove, To banish from his breast his Country's love; To see the smoke from his lov'd palace rise, There is an agreeable tenderness in this Image, and nothing can better paint the ardent desire a man naturally has to review his native country after a long absence. This is still stronger than that which Cicero extols in several places of his works, that Ulysses preferr'd the sight of Ithaca to the Immortality proffer'd him by Calypso. He here desires to purchase, at the price of his life, the pleasure, not of returning to his country, but even of seeing at a distance the very smoke of it. Dacier. There are some things dispers'd in this speech of Pallas, which I shall lay together; as that Minerva makes it an aggravation to the calamity of Ulysses, to be detain'd by a Goddess that loves him; that he is enclosed in an Island; and she adds, round which the Seas flow; as if that was not common to all Islands; but these expressions are used to shew the impossibility of the escape of Ulysses, without the interposition of Jupiter. In the conclusion she observes, that Ulysses never neglected to sacrifice before Troy: this is said to shew the great piety of Ulysses, who not only paid his sacrifies in Ithaca, where he abounded in riches, but amongst strangers in an enemy's country, where there might be a scarcity of offerings. Eustathius. While the dear isle in distant prospect lyes, With what contentment could he close his eyes? And will Omnipotence neglect to save The suffering virtue of the wise and brave? Must he, whose altars on the Phrygian shore With frequent rites, and pure, avow'd thy pow'r, Be doom'd the worst of human ills to prove, Unbless'd, abandon'd to the wrath of Jove? Daughter! what words have pass'd thy lips unweigh'd? This verse is frequently repeated both in the Iliad and the Odyssey; it has here a particular energy. Jupiter reproves Minerva for supposing he could ever be unmindful of an Hero so pious as Ulysses. It is spoken with vehemence; an instance, says Eustathius, that it is not only equitable, but an attribute of Divinity, for rulers to remember those who serve them faithfully. (Reply'd the Thund'rer to the Martial Maid) Deem not unjustly by my doom opprest Of human race the wisest, and the best. Neptune, by pray'r repentant rarely won, Afflicts the chief, t'avenge his Giant-son, It is artful in the Poet to tell the Reader the occasion of the sufferings of Ulysses in the opening of the Poem; 'tis a justice due to his character, to shew that his misfortunes are not the consequence of his crimes, but the effect of Neptune's anger. It is observable, that Homer does not stop to explain how Ulysses put out the eye of the Cyclops; he hastens forward into the middle of his Poem, and leaves that for the future narration of Ulysses. Whose visual orb Ulysses robb'd of light; Great Polypheme, of more than mortal might! Him young Thoösa bore, (the bright increase Of Phorcys, dreaded in the sounds and seas:) Whom Neptune ey'd with bloom of beauty blest, And in his cave the yielding nymph comprest. For this, the god constrains the Greek to roam, A hopeless exile from his native home, From death alone exempt—but cease to mourn; Let all combine t'atchieve his wish'd return: Neptune aton'd, his wrath shall now refrain, Or thwart the synod of the gods in vain. Father and King ador'd! Minerva cry'd, Since all who in th'Olympian bow'r reside Now make the wand'ring Greek their public care, Let Hermes to th' Ogygia. Atlantic isle repair; Bid him, arriv'd in bright Calypso's court, The Sanction of th'assembled pow'rs report: That wise Ulysses to his native land Must speed, obedient to their high command. Mean time Telemachus, the blooming heir Rapin has rais'd several objections against this piece of conduct in Homer: He tells us that the action of the Odyssey is imperfect, that it begins with the voyages of Telemachus, and ends with those of Ulysses: That the four first books are all concerning Telemachus: That his voyage bears no proportion to that of Ulysses, that it contributes nothing to his return, which is brought about by Jupiter, and the assistance of the Phæacians; that this gave occasion to Beni in his academical discourses to assert, that the Fable of the Odyssey is double, that the four first books of it are neither Episode, nor part of an action, nor have any connexion with the rest of the work. I am of opinion, that these objections are made with too great severity; The destruction of the Suitors is the chief hinge upon which the Poem turns, as it contributes chiefly to the re-establishment of Ulysses in his country and regality; and whatever contributes to this end, contributes to the principal action, and is of a piece with the rest of the Poem; and that this voyage does so is evident, in that it gives a defeat to the Suitors, and controuls their insolence; it preserves Ulysses's throne and bed inviolate, in that it gives Telemachus courage to resist their attempts: It sets his character in a fair point of light, who is the second personage of the Poem, and is to have a great share in the future actions of it. Eustathius judiciously observes, that Homer here prepares the way for the defeat of the Suitors, the chief design of his Poem; and lays the ground-work of probability on which he intends to build his Poem, and reconcile it to the rules of credibility. If it be ask'd for what end this voyage of Telemachus is made; the answer is, to enquire after Ulysses: So that whatever Episodes are interwoven, Ulysses is still in view; and whatever Telemachus acts, is undertaken solely upon his account; and consequently, whatever is acted, contributes to the principal design, the restoration of Ulysses. So that the Fable is entire, and the Action not double. 'Tis to be remember'd also, that the sufferings of Ulysses are the subject of the Poem; his personal calamities are not only intended, but his domestic misfortunes; and by this conduct Homer shews us the extent of his misfortunes: His Queen is attempted, his Throne threaten'd, and his Wealth consumed in riot; Ulysses suffers in Telemachus, and in every circumstance of life is unhappy. Of sea-girt Ithaca, demands my care: 'Tis mine, to form his green, unpractis'd years, In this the Poet draws the out-lines of what he is to fill-up in the four subsequent books: and nothing can give us a greater idea of his unbounded invention, than his building upon so plain a foundation such a noble superstructure: He entertains us with variety of Episodes, historical relations, and manners of those ancient times. It must be confess'd, that the Characters in the Odyssey, and the number of the chief Actors, are but few; and yet the Poet never tires, he varies and diversifies the story so happily, that he is continually opening new scenes to engage our attention. He resembles his own Proteus, he is capable of all shapes, yet in all shapes the same Deity. In sage debates, surrounded with his Peers, To save the state; and timely to restrain The bold intrusion of the Suitor-train; Who crowd his palace, and with lawless pow'r His herds and flocks in feastful rites devour. To distant Sparta, and the spacious waste Rapin is very severe upon this conduct. When Telemachus, says he, is to search for his father in the Courts of Greece, he cannot make the least progress without Minerva; 'tis she who inspires his thoughts, and assists in the execution. Could not honour, duty, or nature have moved his heart toward an absent father? The Machine, adds he, has not the least appearance of probability, inasmuch as the Goddess conducts him to every place, except only where Ulysses resides; of which she ought by no means to be ignorant, upon the account of her Divinity. But surely nothing can be more natural, than for a son, in order to gain intelligence of an absent father, to enquire in those places, and of those persons, where and from whom he is most likely to have information. Such is the conduct of Telemachus: And Poetry, which delights in the Wonderful, because this conduct agrees with wisdom, ascribes it to Minerva the Goddess of it. No doubt but Minerva knew where Ulysses resided: but men must act as men: such an immediate interposition as Rapin requires, had stopp'd at once the fountain of the Poet's invention. If what a Poet invents be natural, it is justifiable; and he may give the rein to his imagination, if he restrain it from running into extravagance and wildness. Of sandy Pyle, the royal Youth shall haste. There, warm with filial love, the cause enquire That from his realm retards his god-like Sire: Deliv'ring early to the voice of Fame The promise of a great, immortal name. She said: the sandals of cælestial mold Fledg'd with Ambrosial plumes, and rich with gold, Surround her feet; with these sublime she sails Th'aerial space, and mounts the winged gales: O'er earth and ocean wide prepar'd to soar, Her dreaded arm a beamy jav'lin bore, Pond'rous and vast; which when her fury burns, Proud Tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns. From high Olympus prone her flight she bends, And in the realm of Ithaca descends. Her lineaments divine the grave disguise Of Mentes' form conceal'd from human eyes: (Mentes, the Monarch of the Taphian land) We are told by tradition, that Homer was so sensible of friendship, that to do honour to his particular friends, he immortalized their names in his Poems. In the Iliad he has shewn his gratitude to Tychius; and in the Odyssey, to Mentes, Phemius, and Mentor. This Mentes was a famous Merchant of the isle of Leucade, who received Homer at Smyrna, and made him his companion in all his voyages. It is to this Mentes we owe the two Poems of Homer, for the Poet in all probability had never wrote them without those lights and informations he receiv'd, and the discoveries he was enabled to make, by those travels. Homer is not contented to give his name to the King of the Taphians, but feigns also that the Goddess of Wisdom chose to appear in his shape, preferably to that of all the Kings who were nearer neighbours to Ithaca. Eustathius thinks there might have been a real King of Taphos of this name, who was a friend to Ulysses. This may possibly be; but I would chuse to adhere rather to the old tradition, as it does honour to friendship. Dacier. A glitt'ring spear wav'd awful in her hand. There in the portal plac'd, the heav'n-born maid Enormous riot and mis-rule survey'd. This is the first appearance of the Suitors; and the Poet has drawn their pictures in such colours, as are agreeable to their characters thro' the whole Poem. They are, as Horace expresses it, ? Fruges consumere nati, Sponsi Penelopes, Nebulones ? The Poet gives a fine contrast between them and Telemachus; he entertains himself with his own thoughts, weighs the sum of things, and beholds with a virtuous sorrow the disorders of the Suitors: He appears, (like Ulysses among his transform'd companions in the tenth book,) a wise man, among brutes. On hides of Beeves, before the palace gate, (Sad spoils of luxury) the Suitors sate. With rival art, and ardor in their mien, At Chess they vie, to captivate the Queen, There are great disputes what this Game was, at which the Suitors play'd. Athenæus relates it from Apian the Grammarian, who had it from Cteson a native of Ithaca, that the sport was in this manner. The number of the Suitors being 108, they equally divided their men, or balls; that is to say, 54 on each side; these were placed on the board opposite to each other. Between the two sides was a vacant space, in the midst of which was the main mark, or Queen, the point which all were to aim at. They took their turns by lot; he who took or displac'd that mark, got his own in its place; and if by a second man, he again took it, without touching any of the others, he won the game; and it pass'd as an omen of obtaining his mistress. This principal mark, or Queen, was called by whatever name the Gamesters pleas'd; and the Suitors gave it the name of Penelope. 'Tis said, this Game was invented by Palamedes during the siege of Troy. [Sophocles in Palam.] Eustath, Spondan. Dacier. Divining of their loves. Attending nigh, A menial train the flowing bowl supply: Others apart, the spacious hall prepare, And form the costly feast with busy care. There young Telemachus, his bloomy face Glowing cælestial-sweet with godlike grace, Amid the Circle shines: but hope and fear (Painful vicissitude!) his bosom tear. Now, imag'd in his mind, he sees restor'd In peace and joy, the people's rightful Lord; The proud Oppressors fly the vengeful sword. While his fond soul these fancied triumphs swell'd, The stranger Guest the royal Youth beheld. Griev'd that a Visitant so long shou'd wait The Reader will lose much of the pleasure of this Poem, if he reads it without the reflection, that he peruses one of the most ancient books in the world; it sets before him persons, places, and actions that existed three thousand years ago: Here we have an instance of the humanity of those early ages: Telemachus pays a reverence to this stranger, only because he is a stranger: He attends him in person, and welcomes him with all the openness of ancient hospitality. Unmark'd, unhonour'd, at a Monarch's gate; Instant he flew with hospitable haste, And the new friend with courteous air embrac'd. Stranger! whoe'er thou art, securely rest Affianc'd in my faith, a friendly guest: Approach the dome, the social banquet share, And then the purpose of thy soul declare. Thus affable and mild, the Prince precedes, And to the dome th'unknown Cælestial leads. The spear receiving from her hand, he plac'd Against a column, fair with sculpture grac'd; Where seemly rang'd in peaceful order stood Ulysses' Arms, now long difus'd to blood. He led the Goddess to the sovereign seat, Her feet supported with a stool of state; (A purple carpet spread the pavement wide) Then drew his seat, familiar, to her side: Far from the Suitor-train, a brutal crowd, With insolence, and wine, elate and loud; Where the free guest, unnoted, might relate, If haply conscious, of his Father's fate. The golden ew'r a maid obsequious brings, Replenish'd from the cool, translucent springs; With copious water the bright vase supplies A silver Laver, of capacious size: They wash. The tables in fair order spread, They heap the glitt'ring Canisters with bread: Viands of various kinds allure the taste, There is nothing that has drawn more ridicule upon Homer, than the frequent descriptions of his entertainments: It has been judged, that he was more than ordinarily delighted with them, since he omits no opportunity to describe them; nay, his temperance has not been unsuspected, according to that verse of Horace, Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus. But we must not condemn, without stronger evidence: a man may commend a sumptuous entertainment, or good wines, without being either a drunkard or a glutton. But since there are so many entertainments describ'd in the Poem, it may not be improper to give this some explanation. They wash before the feast; perhaps, says Eustathlus, because they always at the feast made libations to the Gods. The Ewer was of gold, the vessel from whence the water was pour'd of silver, and the cups out of which they drank, were of gold. A damsel attends Mentes, but heralds wait upon the Suitors: Eustathius observes a decency in this conduct; the Suitors were lewd debauchees, and consequently a woman of modesty would have been an improper attendant upon such a company. Beautiful Youths attended the company in quality of cup-bearers. A Matron who has charge of the houshold (?????) brings in the bread and the cold meats, for so Eustathius interprets ??????; an Officer, whose employ it was to portion out the victuals, brings in the meats that furnish'd out the rest of the entertainment; and after the feast, a Bard diverts them with vocal and instrumental music. Dacier is in great pain about the cold victuals; she is afraid lest the Reader should think them the leavings of a former day: and tells us they might possibly be in the nature of our cold Tongues, Jambons, &amp;c. But I think such fears to be groundless: We must have reference to the customs of those early ages; and if it was customary for cold meats to be serv'd up, (neither is it necessary to suppose them the leavings of the former entertainment) it can be no disgrace to the hospitality of Telemachus. Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast! Delicious wines th'attending herald brought; The gold gave lustre to the purple draught. Lur'd with the vapour of the fragrant feast, In rush'd the Suitors with voracious haste: Marshal'd in order due, to each a Sew'r Presents, to bathe his hands, a radiant ew'r. Luxurious then they feast. Observant round Gay, stripling youths the brimming goblets crown'd. The rage of hunger quell'd, they all advance, And form to measur'd airs the mazy dance: To Phemius was consign'd the chorded Lyre, In ancient times, Princes entertain'd in their families certain learned and wise men, who were both Poets and Philosophers, and not only made it their business to amuse and delight, but to promote wisdom and morality. Ulysses, at his departure for Troy, left one of these with Penelope: and it was usual to consign, in this manner, the care of their wives and families to the Poets of those days, as appears from a signal passage in the third book, verse (of the original) 267, &amp;c. To this man Homer gives the name of Phemius; to celebrate one of his friends, who was so call'd, and who had been his Præceptor (says Eustathius.) I must add one remark, that tho' he places his Master here in no very good company, yet he guards his character from any imputation, by telling us, that he attended the Suitors by compulsion. This is not only a great instance of his gratitude, but also of his tenderness and delicacy. Whose hand reluctant touch'd the warbling wire: Phemius, whose voice divine cou'd sweetest sing High strains, responsive to the vocal string. Mean while, in whispers to his heav'nly guest His indignation thus the Prince exprest. Indulge my rising grief, whilst these (my friend) With song and dance the pompous revel end. Light is the dance, and doubly sweet the lays, When, for the dear delight, another pays. His treasur'd stores these Cormorants consume, Whose bones, defrauded of a regal tomb And common turf, lie naked on the plain, Or doom'd to welter in the whelming main. Shou'd he return, that troop so blithe and bold, With purple robes inwrought, and stiff with gold, Precipitant in fear, wou'd wing their flight, And curse their cumbrous pride's unwieldy weight. But ah I dream!—th'appointed hour is fled, And Hope, too long with vain delusion fed, Deaf to the rumour of fallacious fame, Gives to the roll of death his glorious name! With venial freedom let me now demand Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land: Sincere, from whence began thy course, recite, And to what ship I owe the friendly freight? Now first to me this visit dost thou daign, Or number'd in my Father's social train? All who deserv'd his choice, he made his own, 'Tis evident, from this and many places in the Iliad, that Hospitality was hereditary; an happiness and honour peculiar to these heroic ages. And surely nothing can set the character of Ulysses in a more agreeable point of light, than what Telemachus here delivers of it; “He was the friend of all mankind.” Eustathius observes, that ?????????? has a middle signification; that it implies that Ulysses behaved benevolently to all men; or that all men behaved benevolently to Ulysses; either sense makes Ulysses a very amiable person: He must be a friend to all men, to whom all men are friends. And curious much to know, he far was known.

Freighted with Iron from my native land, I steer my voyage to the Brutian strand; In the country of the Brutians, in the lower part of Italy, was a town call'd Temese. That Homer here meant this city, and not one of the same name in Cyprus, appears not only because this was famous for works of brass, but because (as Strabo observes) Ithaca lay in the direct way from Taphos to this city of the Brutii; whereas it was considerably out of the way to pass by Ithaca to that of Cyprus. The same Author says, that the rooms for preparing of brass were remaining in his time, tho' then out of use. Ovid. Met. 15. Hippotadæque domo: regis, Temesesque metalla. And Statius, Sylv. ? se totis Temese dedit hausta metallis.

Laertes can relate Our faith unspotted, and its early date; Who prest with heart-corroding grief and years, This most beautiful passage of Laertes has not escap'd the censure of the Critics; they say he acts an unmanly part, he forgets that he is a King, and reduces himself unworthily into the condition of a servant. Eustathius gives two reasons for his retirement, which answer those objections; the first is, that he could not endure to see the outrage and insolence of the Suitors; the second, that his Grief for Ulysses makes him abandon society, and prefer his vineyard to his Court. This is undoubtedly the picture of human nature under affliction; for sorrow loves solitude. Thus it is, as Dacier well observes, that Menedemus in Terence laments his lost Son: Menedemus is the Picture of Laertes. Nor does it make any difference, that the one is a King, the other a person of private station: Kings are but ennobled humanity, and are liable, as other men, to as great, if not greater, sensibility. The word ????????? (creeping about his vineyard) has also given offence, as it carries an idea of meanness with it; but Eustathius observes, that it excellently expresses the melancholy of Laertes, and denotes no meanness of spirit: The same word is apply'd to the great Achilles in the Iliad, when he laments at the Obsequies of Patroclus; and Horace no doubt had it in his view, —Tacitum sylvas inter-reptare salubreis. To the gay Court a rural shed prefers, Where sole of all his train, a Matron sage Supports with homely food his drooping age, With feeble steps from marshalling his Vines Returning sad, when toilsome day declines. With friendly speed, induc'd by erring fame, To hail Ulysses' safe return I came: But still the frown of some celestial pow'r With envious joy retards the blissful hour. Let not your soul be sunk in sad despair; He lives, he breathes this heav'nly vital air, Among a savage race, whose shelfy bounds It is the observation of Eustathius, that what Minerva here delivers bears resemblance to the Oracles, in which part is false, part true: That Ulysses is detain'd in an Island, is a truth; that he is detain'd by Barbarians, a falshood: This is done by the Goddess, that she may be thought to be really a man, as she appears to be; she speaks with the dubiousness of a man, not the certainty of a Goddess; she raises his expectation, by shewing she has an insight into futurity; and to engage his belief, she discovers in part the truth to Telemachus. Neither was it necessary or convenient for Telemachus to know the whole truth: for if he had known that Ulysses inhabited a desart, detain'd by a Goddess, he must of consequence have known of his return, (for he that could certify the one, could certify the other,) and so had never gone in search of him; and it would hence have happen'd, that Homer had been depriv'd of giving us those graces of Poetry which arise from the voyage of Telemachus. Eustathius. With ceaseless roar the foaming deep surrounds. The thoughts which rowl within my ravish'd breast, To me, no Seer, th'inspiring Gods suggest; Nor skill'd, nor studious, with prophetic eye To judge the winged Omens of the sky. Yet hear this certain speech, nor deem it vain; Though Adamantine bonds the chief restrain, The dire restraint his wisdom will defeat, And soon restore him to his regal seat. But, gen'rous youth! sincere and free declare, Are you, of manly growth, his royal heir? For sure Ulysses in your look appears, The same his features, if the same his years. Such was that face, on which I dwelt with joy Ere Greece assembled stem'd the tydes to Troy; But parting then for that detested shore, Our eyes, unhappy! never greeted more. To prove a genuine birth (the Prince replies) There is an appearance of something very shocking in this speech of Telemachus. It literally runs thus: My mother assures me that I am the son of Ulysses, but I know it not. It seems to reflect upon his mother's chastity, as if he had a doubt of his own legitimacy. This seeming simplicity in Telemachus, says Eustathius, is the effect of a troubled spirit; it is grief that makes him doubt if he can be the son of the great, the generous Ulysses; it is no reflection upon Penelope, and consequently no fault in Telemachus: It is an undoubted truth that the mother only knows the legitimacy of the child: Thus Euripides, ? ???, ??? ????? ????? ???? ??? ??????. that is, The mother knows the child, the father only believes it. Thus also Menander, ????? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ??????? ???? ?????????? ?????? ? ???????????. that is, no man knows assuredly who begot him, we only guess it, and believe it. Aristotle in his Rhetoric is also of this opinion; ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ????????? ?? ????????. What I have here said, is translated literally from Eustathius, and if it edifies the Reader I am content. But the meaning of the passage is this, Mentes asks Telemachus if he be the son of Ulysses; he replies, “So my mother assures me; but nothing sure so wretched as I am could proceed from that great man.” But however this may be reconciled to truth, I believe few Ladies would take it as a compliment, if their sons shou'd tell them there was some room to doubt of their legitimacy: there may be abundance of truth in it, and yet very little decency. On Female truth assenting faith relies; Thus manifest of right, I build my claim Sure-founded on a fair Maternal fame, Ulysses' Son: but happier he, whom fate Hath plac'd beneath the storms which toss the great! Happier the son, whose hoary sire is blest With humble affluence, and domestic rest! Happier than I, to future empire born, But doom'd a Father's wretched fate to mourn! To whom, with aspect mild, the Guest divine. Oh true descendant of a scepter'd line! The Gods, a glorious fate from anguish free To chaste Penelope's increase decree. But say, yon' jovial Troop so gaily drest, Is this a bridal, or a friendly feast? Or from their deed I rightlier may divine, Unseemly flown with insolence and wine? Unwelcome revellers, whose lawless joy Pains the sage ear, and hurts the sober eye. Magnificence of old, (the Prince reply'd,) Beneath our roof with Virtue cou'd reside; Unblam'd abundance crown'd the royal board, What time this dome rever'd her prudent Lord; Who now (so heav'n decrees) is doom'd to mourn, Bitter constraint! erroneous and forlorn. Better the Chief, on Ilion's hostile plain Had fall'n surrounded with his warlike train; Or safe return'd, the race of glory past, New to his friends embrace, had breath'd his last! Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes wou'd raise Historic Marbles, to record his praise; His praise, eternal on the faithful stone, Had with transmissive honour grac'd his Son. Now snatch'd by Harpies to the dreary coast, The meaning of this expression is, that Ulysses has not had the rites of sepulture. This among the Ancients was esteem'd the greatest of calamities, as it hinder'd the Shades of the deceased from entering into the state of the happy. Sunk is the Hero, and his glory lost! Vanish'd at once! unheard of, and unknown! And I, his Heir in misery alone. Nor for a dear, lost Father only flow The filial tears, but woe succeeds to woe: To tempt the spouseless Queen with am'rous wiles, Resort the Nobles from the neighb'ring Isles; It is necessary to reconcile the conduct of the Suitors to probability, since it has so great a share in the process of the Odyssey. It may seem incredible that Penelope, who is a Queen, in whom the supreme power is lodg'd, should not dismiss such unwelcome intruders, especially since many of them were her own subjects: Besides, it seems an extraordinary way of courtship in them, to ruin the person to whom they make their addresses. To solve this objection we must consider the nature of the Grecian governments: The chief men of the land had great authority; Tho' the government was monarchical, it was not despotic; Laertes was retir'd, and disabled with age; Telemachus was yet in his minority; and the fear of any violence either against her own person, or against her son, might deter Penelope from using any endeavours to remove men of such insolence, and such power. Dacier From Samos, circled with th'Iönian main, Dulichium, and Zacynthus' sylvan reign: Ev'n with presumptuous hope her bed t'ascend, The Lords of Ithaca their right pretend. She seems attentive to their pleaded vows, Her heart detesting what her ear allows. They, vain expectants of the bridal hour, My stores in riotous expence devour, In feast and dance the mirthful months employ, And meditate my doom, to crown their joy. With tender pity touch'd, the Goddess cry'd: Soon may kind heav'n a sure relief provide, Soon may your Sire discharge the vengeance due, And all your wrongs the proud oppressors rue! Oh! in that portal shou'd the Chief appear, Each hand tremendous with a brazen spear, In radiant Panoply his limbs incas'd; (For so of old my father's court he grac'd, When social mirth unbent his serious soul, O'er the full banquet, and the sprightly bowl) He then from Ephyré, the fair domain Of Ilus sprung from Jason's royal strain, Measur'd a length of seas, a toilsome length, in vain. For voyaging to learn the direful art To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart; It is necessary to explain this passage. It seems at first view, as if Ulysses had requested what a good man could not grant. Ilus, says Mentes, deny'd the Poison, because he fear'd the anger of the Gods; and the poison it self is call'd by Homer ??????????, as if it were design'd against mankind. Eustathius defends Ulysses variously: He intended, says he, to employ it against beasts only, that infested his country, or in hunting. He assigns another reason, and says that the Poet is preparing the way to give an air of probability to the destruction of the Suitors. He poisons his arrows, that every wound may be mortal; on this account the poison may be call'd ??????????; for it is certain in the wars of Troy, poison'd arrows were not in use, for many persons who were wounded recover'd; so that of necessity they must be reserv'd for domestic occasions. From what has been said we may collect the reason why Anchialus granted the poison to Ulysses, and Ilus deny'd it; Anchialus was the friend of Ulysses, and knew that he would not employ it to any ill purpose; but Ilus, who was a stranger to him, was afraid lest he should abuse it. Eustathius. Observant of the Gods, and sternly just, Ilus refus'd t'impart the baneful trust: With friendlier zeal my father's soul was fir'd, The drugs he knew, and gave the boon desir'd. Appear'd he now with such heroic port, As then conspicuous at the Taphian court; Soon shou'd yon' boasters cease their haughty strife, Or each atone his guilty love with life. But of his wish'd return the care resign; Be future vengeance to the pow'rs divine. My sentence hear: With stern distaste avow'd, To their own districts drive the Suitor-crowd: When next the morning warms the purple East, Convoke the Peerage, and the Gods attest; The sorrows of your inmost soul relate; And form sure plans to save the sinking state. Shou'd second love a pleasing flame inspire, And the chaste Queen connubial rites require; Dismiss'd with honour let her hence repair I will lay before the reader literally what Eustathius observes upon these words. There is a Solœcism, says he, in these verses or words, that cannot be reduc'd to the rules of construction. It should be ?????, not ?????? ??? ???. How then comes the accusative case to be used instead of the nominative? Mentes, adds he, may be suppos'd to have intended to have said ?????????, (send thy Mother away;) but considering, in the midst of the Sentence, that such advice was not suitable to be given to Telemachus, he checks himself, and suppresses ?????????; and no other word immediately occurring, that requir'd an accusative case, he falls into a Solœcism. But perhaps this is more ingenious than true; tho' Mentes was in haste when he spoke it, Homer was not when he compos'd it. Might not an error creep into the original by the negligence of a Transcriber, who might write ?????? for ?????? This is the more probable, because the one stands in the Verse in every respect as well as the other. What Eustathius adds is very absurd: he says that Telemachus must observe both the interpretations, either send thy Mother away, or let thy Mother retire. So that the advice was double, send thy Mother away if thou dost not love her; but if thou art unwilling to grieve her, let her recess be voluntary. To great Icarius, whose paternal care Will guide her passion, and reward the choice With wealthy dow'r, and bridal gifts of price. Then let this dictate of my love prevail: Instant, to foreign realms prepare to sail, To learn your Father's fortunes: Fame may prove Or omen'd Voice (the messenger of Jove) There is a difficulty in this Passage. In any case of enquiry, any Words that were heard by accident were call'd by the Latins, Omens; by Homer, the voice of Jupiter; and he stiles them so, because it is thro' his providence that those words come to our knowledge: ????? signifies fame or rumour; and the Ancients refer'd all voices or sounds to Jupiter; and stil'd him ???? ??????????. So that the voice of Jove implies any words that we hear by chance, from whence we can draw any thing that gives light to our concerns or enquiries. Dacier. Eustathius. Propitious to the search. Direct your toil Thro' the wide Ocean first to sandy Pyle, Of Nestor, hoary Sage, his doom demand; Thence speed your voyage to the Spartan strand, For young Atrides to th'Achaian coast Arriv'd the last of all the victor host. If yet Ulysses views the light, forbear, 'Till the fleet hours restore the circling year. But if his soul hath wing'd the destin'd flight, Inhabitant of deep disastrous Night, Homeward with pious speed repass the main, To the pale Shade funereal rites ordain, Plant the fair Column o'er the vacant grave, A Hero's honours let the Hero have. With decent grief the royal dead deplor'd, For the chaste Queen select an equal Lord. Then let revenge your daring mind employ, By fraud or force the Suitor-train destroy, And starting into manhood, scorn the boy. Hast thou not heard how young Orestes fir'd It may seem that this example of Orestes does not come fully up to the purpose intended: There is a wide difference in the circumstances: Orestes slew an adulterer, and a single person, with an adulteress. The designs of Telemachus are not against one, but many enemies; neither are they adulterers, nor have they slain the father of Telemachus, as is the case of Orestes: nor is Penelope an adulteress. The intent therefore of the Goddess is only to shew what a glorious act it is to defend our parents: Orestes, says Mentes, is every where celebrated for honouring his father, and thou shalt obtain equal honour by defending thy mother. The sense that ??????????? here bears is remarkable, it signifies not only a person who kills his own father, but who kills the father of any other person. Eustathius. With great revenge, immortal praise acquir'd? His virgin sword Ægysthus' veins imbru'd; The murd'rer fell, and blood aton'd for blood. O greatly bless'd with ev'ry blooming grace! With equal steps the paths of glory trace; Join to that royal youth's, your rival name, And shine eternal in the sphere of fame— But my Associates now my stay deplore, Impatient on the hoarse-resounding shore. Thou, heedful of advice, secure proceed; My praise the precept is, be thine the deed. The counsel of my friend (the Youth rejoin'd) Imprints conviction on my grateful mind. So Fathers speak (persuasive speech and mild!) Their sage experience to the fav'rite child. But since to part, for sweet refection due The genial viands let my train renew; And the rich pledge of plighted faith receive, Worthy the heir of Ithaca to give. Defer the promis'd boon, (the Goddess cries, Celestial azure brightning in her eyes) And let me now regain the Reithrian port: From Temesé return'd, your royal court I shall revisit; and that pledge receive, And gifts, memorial of our friendship, leave. Abrupt, with eagle-speed she cut the sky; I pass over the several interpretations that have been given to the word ???????; some say it implies she flew up the chimney, &amp;c. In reality it signifies a species of an eagle; but it may also signify the same as ?????? (invisible,) either of the latter senses are natural, or both together, like an eagle she disappear'd. Eustathius. Instant invisible to mortal eye. Then first he recognis'd th'Ætherial guest; Wonder and joy alternate fire his breast: Heroic thoughts infus'd his heart dilate, Revolving much his father's doubtful fate: At length compos'd, he join'd the suitor-throng, Hush'd in attention to the warbled song. There may be two reasons why this is inserted; either the Suitors were pleas'd with the sweetness of the song, or the subject of it; they sate attentive to hear the death of Ulysses, in the process of his story. This gives us a reason why immediately Penelope descended to stop the song; she fear'd lest he might touch upon the story of Ulysses, and say that he dy'd in his return. This would have reduc'd her to the utmost necessity, and she could not have deferr'd to marry. Phemius would have certainly found credit, for Poets were believ'd to be inspir'd by the Gods; they were look'd upon as Prophets, and to have something of divinity in them, as appears from Demodocus in the 8?? book of the Odyssey. Besides there was a further necessity to put a stop to the song. If Phemius had declar'd him to be dead, Penelope could not have avoided marriage; if alive, the Suitors might have desisted, or arm'd themselves against Ulysses, and then their Deaths, one of the principal incidents of the Poem, could not have follow'd; neither could Telemachus have gone in search of his father, if he had foreknown his death, or sudden return. It is therefore artful in the Poet to cut the song short, he reserves the story of Ulysses for future narration, and brings all this about by a very probable method, by the interposition of Penelope, who requests that some other story may be chosen, a story that she can hear without sorrow. It is very customary for women to be present at the entertainments of men; as appears from the conduct of Helen, Arete, Nausicaa, and Penelope in divers parts of the Odyssey: She is here introduced with the greatest decency; she enters not the room, but stands with tears at the threshold; and even at that distance appears with her face shaded by a veil. Eustathius. His tender theme the charming Lyrist chose Minerva's anger, and the direful woes Which voyaging from Troy the Victors bore, While storms vindictive intercept the shore. The shrilling airs the vaulted roof rebounds, Reflecting to the Queen the silver sounds. With grief renew'd the weeping fair descends; Their sovereign's step a virgin train attends: A veil of richest texture wrought, she wears, And silent, to the joyous hall repairs. There from the portal, with her mild command Thus gently checks the minstrel's tuneful hand. Phemius! let acts of Gods, and Heroes old. What ancient bards in hall and bow'r have told, Attemper'd to the Lyre, your voice employ; Such the pleas'd ear will drink with silent joy. But oh! forbear that dear, disastrous name, To sorrow sacred, and secure of fame: My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound, And ev'ry piercing note inflicts a wound. Why, dearest object of my duteous love, (Reply'd the Prince) will you the Bard reprove? Oft, Jove's ætherial rays (resistless fire) Telemachus here reproves his mother for commanding Phemius to desist, or not to make Ulysses the subject of his song: by saying, that it was not in the Poet's own power to chuse his subject, which was frequently dictated and inspired by the Gods. This is a particular instance of the opinion the Ancients held as to the immediate inspiration of their Poets. The words in the original evidently bear this sense. If the subject displease you, 'tis not the Poet but Jupiter is to blame, who inspires men of invention, as he himself pleases. And Mad. Dacier strangely mistakes this passage, in rendring it, 'tis not the Poet but Jupiter who is the cause of our misfortunes, for 'tis he who dispenses to wretched mortals good or evil as he pleases. At the same time she acknowledges the word ????????, which she here renders laborious, or wretched, to signify persons of wit, in the beginning of lib. 4. and persons of skill and ability in their art, in lib. II. The chanter's soul and raptur'd song inspire; Instinct divine! nor blame severe his choice, Warbling the Grecian woes with harp and voice! For novel lays attract our ravish'd ears; But old, the mind with inattention hears. Patient permit the sadly-pleasing strain; Familiar now with grief, your tears refrain, And in the publick woe forget your own; You weep not for a perish'd Lord, alone. What Greeks, now wand'ring in the Stygian gloom, With your Ulysses shar'd an equal doom! Your widow'd hours, apart, with female toil These verses are taken literally from the 6?? book of the Iliad, except that ????? is inserted instead of ???????; Eustathius explains the passage thus: Women are not forbid entirely to speak, for women are talking animals, ??????? ????, they have the faculty of talking, and indeed are rational creatures; but they must not give too much liberty to that unruly member, in the company of men. Sophocles advises well, ????? ?????? ?????? ? ???? ?????. O woman, silence is the ornament of thy sex. Madam Dacier, tho' she plunders almost every thing, has spared this observation. And various labours of the loom, beguile; There rule, from palace-cares remote and free, That care to man belongs, and most to me. Mature beyond his years the Queen admires His sage reply, and with her train retires. Then swelling sorrows burst their former bounds, With echoing grief afresh the dome resounds; 'Till Pallas, piteous of her plaintive cries, In slumber clos'd her silver-streaming eyes. Mean-time rekindl'd at the royal charms, Tumultuous love each beating bosom warms; Intemp'rate rage a wordy war began; But bold Telemachus assum'd the man. Instant (he cry'd) your female discord end, Ye deedless boasters! and the song attend: Obey that sweet compulsion, nor profane With dissonance the smooth melodious strain. Pacific now prolong the jovial feast; But when the dawn reveals the rosy East, I, to the Peers assembled, shall propose The firm resolve I here in few disclose. No longer live the cankers of my court; All to your several states with speed resort; Waste in wild riot what your land allows, There ply the early feast, and late carouse. But if, to honour lost, 'tis still decreed For you my bowl shall flow, my flocks shall bleed, Judge and revenge my right, impartial Iove! By him, and all th'immortal thrones above, (A sacred oath) each proud oppressor slain Shall with inglorious gore this marble stain. Aw'd by the Prince, thus haughty, bold, and young, Rage gnaw'd the lip, and wonder chain'd the tongue. Silence at length the gay Antinous broke, Constrain'd a smile, and thus ambiguous spoke. What God to your untutor'd youth affords Antinous and Eurymathus are Ithacensians, and are call'd the chief of the Suitors. It is therefore necessary to distinguish their characters; Antinous is violent, and determin'd against Ulysses; Eurymachus more gentle and subtle: Antinous derides, Eurymachus flatters. This speech of Antinous is a conceal'd raillery; he tells Telemachus, that Jove inspires his soul with wisdom, but means that his education has been such, that he had learn'd nothing from man; he wishes (out of a seemingly kind concern for him) that he may never reign in Ithaca, because the weight of a crown is a burthen; and concludes with mentioning his hereditary title to it, to insinuate that is his by descent only, and not by merit. Telemachus, in his answer, wisely dissembles the affront of Antinous, he takes it in the better sense, and seems to differ only in opinion about the Regality. Think you, says he, that to be a King is to be miserable? To be a King, in my judgment, is to enjoy affluence and honour. He asserts his claim to the succession of his father, yet seems to decline it, to lay the suspicions of the Suitors asleep, that they may not prevent the measures he takes to obtain it. Eustathius. The speech of Eurymachus confirms the former observation, that this Suitor is of a more soft and moderate behaviour than Antinous: He cloaths ill designs with a seeming humanity, and appears a friend, while he carries on the part of an enemy: Telemachus had said, that if it was the will of Jupiter, he would ascend the Throne of Ithaca: Eurymachus answers, that this was as the Gods shou'd determine; an insinuation that they regarded not his claim from his father. Telemachus said he would maintain himself in the possession of his present inheritance: Eurymachus wishes that no one may arrive to dispossess him; the latent meaning of which is, “we of your own country are sufficient for that design.” If these observations of Eustathius be true, Eurymachus was not a less enemy than Antinous, but a better dissembler. This headlong torrent of amazing words? May Jove delay thy reign, and cumber late So bright a genius with the toils of state! Those toils (Telemachus serene replies) Have charms, with all their weight, t'allure the wise. Fast by the Throne obsequious Fame resides, And Wealth incessant rolls her golden tides. Nor let Antinous rage, if strong desire Of wealth and fame a youthful bosom fire: Elect by Jove his Delegate of sway, With joyous pride the summons I'd obey. Whene'er Ulysses roams the realm of Night, Shou'd factious pow'r dispute my lineal right, Some other Greeks a fairer claim may plead; To your pretence their title wou'd precede. At least, the sceptre lost, I still shou'd reign Sole o'er my vassals, and domestic train. To this Eurymachus. To heav'n alone Refer the choice to fill the vacant Throne. Your patrimonial stores in peace possess; Undoubted all your filial claim confess: Your private right shou'd impious pow'r invade, The peers of Ithaca wou'd arm in aid. But say, that Stranger-guest who late withdrew, What, and from whence? his name and lineage shew. His grave demeanour, and majestic grace Speak him descended of no vulgar race: Did he some loan of ancient right require, Or came fore-runner of your scepter'd Sire? Oh son of Polybus! the Prince replies, No more my Sire will glad these longing eyes: The Queen's fond hope inventive rumour cheers, Or vain diviners' dreams divert her fears. That stranger-guest the Taphian realm obeys, A realm defended with incircling seas. Mentes, an ever-honour'd name, of old High in Ulysses' social list inroll'd. Thus he, tho' conscious of th'ætherial Guest, Answer'd evasive of the sly request. Mean time the Lyre rejoins the sprightly lay; Love-dittied airs, and dance, conclude the day. But when the Star of Eve, with golden light Adorn'd the matron-brow of sable Night; The mirthful train dispersing quit the court, And to their several domes to Rest resort. A tow'ring structure to the palace join'd; To this his steps the thoughtful Prince inclin'd; In his pavilion there to sleep repairs; The lighted torch the sage Euryclea bears. Euryclea was a very aged person; she was bought by Laertes, to nurse Ulysses; and in her old age attends Telemachus: She cost Laertes twenty oxen; that is, a certain quantity of money (???? ??????????) which would buy twenty oxen: or perhaps the form of an ox was stamp'd upon the metal, and from thence had its appellation. The simplicity of these Heroic times is remarkable; an old woman is the only attendant upon the son of a King: She lights him to his apartment, takes care of his cloaths, and hangs them up at the side of his bed. Greatness then consisted not in shew, but in the mind: this conduct proceeded not from the meanness of poverty, but from the simplicity of manners. Eustathius. Having now gone thro' the first book, I shall only observe to the Reader, that the whole of it does not take up the compass of an entire day: When Minerva appears to Telemachus the Suitors were preparing to sit down to the banquet at noon; and the business of the first book concludes with the day. It is true, that the Gods hold a debate before the descent of Minerva, and some small time must be allow'd for that transaction. It is remarkable, that there is not one Simile in this book, except we allow those three words to be one, ????? ???? ???????; The same observation is true of the first book of the Iliad. See the Notes on that place. (Daughter of Ops, the just Pisenor's son, For twenty beeves by great Laertes won; In rosy prime with Charms attractive grac'd, Honour'd by him, a gentle Lord and chaste, With dear esteem: too wise, with jealous strife To taint the joys of sweet, connubial life. Sole with Telemachus her service ends, A child she nurs'd him, and a man attends.) Whilst to his couch himself the Prince addrest, The duteous dame receiv'd the purple vest: The purple vest with decent care dispos'd, The silver ring she pull'd, the door re-clos'd; The bolt, obedient to the silken cord, To the strong staple's inmost depth restor'd, Secur'd the valves. There, wrapt in silent shade, Pensive, the rules the Goddess gave, he weigh'd; Stretch'd on the downy fleece, no rest he knows, And in his raptur'd soul the Vision glows. THE SECOND BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Council of Ithaca. Telemachus, in the assembly of the Lords of Ithaca, complains of the injustice done him by the Suitors, and insists upon their departure from his Palace; appealing to the Princes, and exciting the people to declare against them. The Suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at least till he shall send the Queen to the Court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two Eagles in the sky, which an Augur expounds to the ruin of the Suitors. Telemachus then demands a Vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to enquire of his father's fortunes. Pallas in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses) helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the second day from the Opening of the Poem. The SCENE continues in the Palace of Ulysses in Ithaca. This book opens with the first appearance of Telemachus upon the stage of action. And Bossu observes the great judgment of the Poet, in beginning with the transactions of Ithaca in the absence of Ulysses: By this method he sets the conduct of Telemachus, Penelope, and the Suitors, in a strong point of light; they all have a large share in the story of the Poem, and consequently ought to have distinguishing characters. It is as necessary in Epic Poetry, as it is on the Theatre, to let us immediately into the character of every person whom the Poet introduces: This adds perspicuity to the story, and we immediately grow acquainted with each personage, and interest our selves in the good or ill fortune that attends them thro' the whole relation. Telemachus is now about twenty years of age: In the eleventh book, the Poet tells us, he was an infant in the arms of his mother when Ulysses sail'd to Troy; that Heroe was absent near twenty years, and from hence we may gather the exact age of Telemachus. He is every where describ'd as a person of piety to the Gods, of duty to his parents, and as a lover of his country: he is prudent, temperate, and valiant: and the Poet well sets off the importance of this young Heroe, by giving him the Goddess of War and Wisdom for his constant attendant. Now red'ning from the dawn, the Morning ray Glow'd in the front of Heav'n, and gave the Day. The youthful Heroe, with returning light, Rose anxious from th'inquietudes of Night. A royal robe he wore with graceful pride, A two-edg'd faulchion threaten'd by his side, Embroider'd sandals glitter'd as he trod, And forth he mov'd, majestic as a God. Then by his Heralds, restless of delay, To council calls the Peers: the Peers obey. Soon as in solemn form th'assembly sate, From his high dome himself descends in state. Bright in his hand a pond'rous javelin shin'd; The Poet describes Telemachus as if he were marching against an enemy, or going to a council of war, rather than to an assembly of Peers in his own country: Two reasons are assign'd for this conduct; either this was the common usage of Princes in those times, or Telemachus might look upon the Suitors as enemies and consequently go to council in arms as against enemies. Eustathius. Two Dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind; This passage has not escap'd the raillery of the Critics; they look upon it as a mean description of a Heroe and a Prince, to give him a brace of dogs only for his guards or attendants: But such was the simplicity of ancient Princes, that except in war they had rarely any attendants or equipage. And we may be confident, Homer copies after the custom of the time, unless we can be so absurd as to suppose, he would feign low circumstances unnecessarily, thro' a want of judgment. Virgil judg'd otherwise, and thought this circumstance worthy of his imitation. Quin etiam gemini custodes limine ab alto Procedunt, gressumque canes comitantur Herilem. Achilles is describ'd in the Iliad with the same attendants. ? nine large dogs domestick at his board. Poetry, observes Dacier, is like Painting, which draws the greatest beauties from the simplest customs: and even in history, we receive a sensible pleasure from the least circumstance that denotes the customs of ancient times. It may be added, that the Poet, as well as the Painter, is obliged to follow the customs of the age of which he writes, or paints: a modern dress would ill become Achilles or Ulysses, such a conduct would be condemned as an absurdity in painting, and ought to be so in poetry. Pallas with grace divine his form improves, And gazing crowds admire him as he moves. His Father's throne he fill'd: while distant stood The hoary Peers, and Aged Wisdom bow'd. 'Twas silence all, at last Ægyptius spoke; Ægyptius, by his age and sorrows broke: A length of days his soul with prudence crown'd, A length of days had bent him to the Ground. His eldest Antiphus. hope in arms to Ilion came, By great Ulysses taught the path to fame; But (hapless youth) the hideous Cyclops tore His quiv'ring limbs, and quaff'd his spouting gore. Three sons remain'd: To climb with haughty fires The royal bed, Eurynomus aspires; The rest with duteous love his griefs asswage, And ease the Sire of half the cares of age. Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns, Homer, says Eustathius, inserts these particularities concerning the family of Ægyptius, to give an air of truth to his story. It does not appear that Ægyptius knew the certainty of the death of Antiphus; (for it is the Poet who relates it, and not the father;) whence, as Dacier observes, should he learn it? he only laments him, according to the prevailing opinion that all the companions of Ulysses were lost with Ulysses. And as he stood, he spoke and wept by turns. Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains, We are here told, that there never had been any council conven'd in Ithaca, since the departure of Ulysses. The general design and moral of the Odyssey, is to inform us of the mischievous effects which the Absence of a King and Father of a Family produces: We deprive, as Bossu observes, the Poem of its very soul, and spoil the Fable, if we retrench from it the disorders which the Suitors create in the absence of Ulysses, both in his family and dominions. Nothing can give us a greater image of those disorders, than what is here related: What must a kingdom suffer in twenty years, without a Ruler, without a Council to make Laws or punish enormities? Such is the condition of Ithaca: Laertes is superannuated; Penelope oppress'd by the violence of the Suitors; and Telemachus to this time, in his minority. It is very artful in the Poet to open the assembly by Ægyptius: Telemachus was the person who conven'd it; and being the greatest personage present, it might be expected that he should open the design of it: But to give Telemachus courage, who was young and inexperienc'd, Ægyptius first rises, and by praising the person who had summon'd them (of whom he seems ignorant) gives Telemachus to understand he has friends among the assembly: This he could no other way so safely have done, considering the power of the Suitors. By this means, Telemachus is encouraged to speak boldly, and arraign the disorders of the Suitors with the utmost freedom. Within these walls inglorious silence reigns. Say then, ye Peers! by whose commands we meet? Why here once more in solemn council fit? Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose: Arrives some message of invading foes? Or say, does high necessity of state Inspire some Patriot, and demand debate! The present Synod speaks its author wise; Assist him, Jove! thou regent of the skies! He spoke. Telemachus with transport glows, Embrac'd the omen, and majestic rose: (His royal hand th'imperial scepter sway'd) Then thus, addressing to Ægyptius, said. Rev'rend old man! lo here confest he stands By whom ye meet; my grief your care demands. No story I unfold of publick woes, Nor bear advices of impending foes: Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown; Of all this happy realm, I grieve alone. For my lost Sire continual sorrows spring, The great, the good; your Father, and your King. Telemachus here sets the character of Ulysses, as a King, in the most agreeable point of light: He rul'd his people with the same mildness as a father rules his children. This must needs have a very happy effect upon the audience; not only as it shews Ulysses to have been a good Governour; but as it recalls the memory of the happiness they receiv'd from that mild government, and obliquely condemns them of ingratitude who had forgot it. By this method also the Poet interests us deeply in the sufferings of Ulysses; we cannot see a good man and good King in distress, without the most tender emotions. Yet more; our house from its foundation bows, What Telemachus here says has given offence to the Critics; they think it indecent for a son to say, that he bears with more regret the disorder of his family than the loss of his father; yet this objection will vanish, if we weigh Penelope, Telemachus, and his whole posterity, against the single person of Ulysses. But what chiefly takes away this objection is, that Telemachus was still in hopes of his father's return: for ??????? does not imply necessarily his death, but absence: and then both with justice and decency, Telemachus may say that he grieves more for the destruction of his family, than for the absence of Ulysses. Our foes are pow'rful, and your sons the foes: Hither, unwelcome to the Queen they come; Why seek they not the rich Icarian dome? If she must wed, from other hands require The dowry; Is Telemachus her Sire? Yet thro' my court the noise of Revel rings, And wastes the wise frugality of Kings. Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice; This passage is ridicul'd by the Critics; they set it in a wrong light, and then grow very pleasant upon it: Telemachus makes a sad outcry because the Suitors eat his sheep, his beeves, and fatted goats; and at last falls into tears. The truth is, the riches of Kings and Princes, in those early ages, consisted chiefly in flocks and cattle; thus Æneas and Paris are describ'd as tending their flocks, &amp;c. and Abraham in the scriptures, as abounding in this kind of wealth. These Critics would form a different idea of the state and condition of Telemachus, if they consider'd that he had been capable to maintain no fewer than an hundred and eight persons in a manner very expensive for many years; for so many (with their attendants) were the Suitors, as appears from the 16?? book; and at the same time he kept up the dignity of his own court, and liv'd with great hospitality. But it is a sufficient answer to the objections against this passage, to observe, that it is not the expence, but manner of it, that Telemachus laments: This he expressly declares by the word ????????; and surely a sober man may complain against luxury, without being arraigned of meanness; and against profusion, without being condemned for parsimony. Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies. Safe in my youth, in riot still they grow, Nor in the helpless Orphan dread a foe. But come it will, the time when manhood grants More pow'rful advocates than vain complaints. Approach that hour! unsufferable wrong Cries to the Gods, and vengeance sleeps too long. Rise then, ye Peers! with virtuous anger rise! Your fame revere, but most th'avenging skies. By all the deathless pow'rs that reign above, By righteous Themis and by thund'ring Jove, (Themis, who gives to councils, or denies Eustathius observes, that there was a custom to carry the statue of Themis to the assemblies in former ages, and carry it back again when those assemblies were dissolv'd; and thus Themis may be said to form, and dissolve an assembly. Dacier dislikes this assertion, as having no foundation in antiquity; she thinks that the assertion of Telemachus is general, that he intimates it is Justice alone that establishes the councils of mankind, and that Injustice confounds and brings the wicked designs of men to confusion. I have follow'd this interpretation, not only as it suits best with the usual morality of Homer, but also as Jupiter is mention'd with Themis; and no such custom is pretended concerning his statue. He is expressly stil'd by the ancients ???? ????????. In Sicily there was an Altar of ???? ????????, or of Jupiter who presides over Councils. Eustathius from Herodotus. Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise) Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow For my lost Sire, nor add new woe to woe. If e'er he bore the sword to strengthen ill, Or having pow'r to wrong, betray'd the will; On me, on me your kindled wrath asswage, And bid the voice of lawless riot rage. If ruin to our royal race ye doom, Be You the spoilers, and our wealth consume. To understand this passage, we must remember, as Eustathius remarks, that Telemachus is pleading his Cause before the Ithacensians; them he constitutes the Judges of his cause: He therefore prevents an answer which they might make, viz. We are not the men that are guilty of these outrages; Telemachus rejoins, “It were better for me to suffer from your hands; for by your quiescence you make my affairs desperate:” an intimation that they should rise in his defence. Then might we hope redress from juster laws, And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause: But while your Sons commit th'unpunish'd wrong, You make the Arm of Violence too strong. While thus he spoke, with rage and grief he frown'd, And dash'd th'imperial sceptre to the ground. The big round tear hung trembling in his eye: This passage is not one of those, where the Poet can be blam'd for causing a Heroe to weep. If we consider the youth of Telemachus, together with the tenderness agreeable to that time of life; the subjects that demand his concern; the apprehension of the loss of a father; and the desolate state of his mother and kingdom: All these make his readiness to burst into tears an argument, not of any want of spirit in him, but of true sense, and goodness of nature: and is a great propriety, which shews the right judgment of the Poet. The Synod griev'd, and gave a pitying sigh, Then silent sate—at length Antinous burns With haughty rage, and sternly thus returns. O insolence of youth! whose tongue affords We find Antinous always setting himself in the strongest opposition to Telemachus; and therefore, he is the first that falls by the spear of Ulysses; the Poet observes justice, and as Antinous is the first in guilt, he is the first in punishment. What Antinous says in this speech concerning the treachery of the female servant of Penelope, prepares the way for the punishment Ulysses inflicts on some of the maids in the conclusion of the Poem: This is an act of Poetical justice; and it is as necessary in Epic as in Tragic Poetry, to reward the just, and punish the guilty. Eustathius. Such railing eloquence, and war of words. Studious thy country's worthies to defame, Thy erring voice displays thy Mother's shame. Elusive of the bridal day, she gives It will be necessary to vindicate the character of Penelope the Heroine of the Poem, from the aspersions of Antinous. It must be confest that she has a very hard game to play, she neither dares consent, nor deny; if she consents, she injures Ulysses, whom she still expects to return; if she denies, she endangers the Throne, and the life of Telemachus, from the violence of the Suitors; so that no other method is left but to elude their addresses. I must not conceal, what Eustathius has mention'd from some Authors, as Lycophron, &amp;c. who say that Penelope was ?????????, in plain English, an Harlot; and he quotes Herodotus, as affirming that she had a son, named Pan, by Hermes; but the Bishop declares it is all a scandal; and every body must conclude the same, from her conduct, as describ'd in Homer. To vindicate her in this place, we must consider who it is that speaks: Antinous, an unsuccessful Lover: and what he blames as a crime, is really her glory; he blames her because she does not comply with their desires; and it had been an act of guilt to have comply'd. He himself sufficiently vindicates her in the conclusion of his speech, where he extols her above all the race of womankind: so that the seeming inconsistence of Penelope must be imputed to the necessity of her affairs: she is artful, but not criminal. The original says, she deceiv'd the Suitors by her messages; a plain intimation, that she us'd no extraordinary familiarities with her Admirers; and thro' the whole course of the Poem she seldom appears in their Assemblies. Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives. Did not the sun, thro' heav'n's wide azure roll'd, For three long years the royal fraud behold? While she, laborious in delusion, spread The spacious loom, and mix'd the various thread: Where as to life the wond'rous figures rise, Thus spoke th'inventive Queen, with artful sighs. “Tho' cold in death Ulysses breathes no more, “Cease yet a while to urge the bridal hour; “Cease, 'till to great Laertes I bequeath It was an ancient custom to dedicate the finest pieces of Weaving and Embroidery, to honour the funerals of the dead: and there were usually wrought by the nearest relations in their life-time.

And the mother of Euryalus in Virgil, to her son. ?

Thus she: at once the gen'rous train complies, Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise. The work she ply'd; but studious of delay, By night revers'd the labours of the day. While thrice the sun his annual journey made, The conscious lamp the midnight fraud survey'd; Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail; The fourth, her maid unfolds th'amazing tale. We saw, as unperceiv'd we took our stand, The backward labours of her faithless hand. Then urg'd, she perfects her illustrious toils; A wond'rous monument of female wiles! But you, oh Peers! and thou, oh Prince! give ear: (I speak aloud, that ev'ry Greek may hear) Dismiss the Queen; and if her sire approves, Let him espouse her to the Peer she loves: Bid instant to prepare the bridal train, Nor let a race of Princes wait in vain. Tho' with a grace divine her soul is blest, And all Minerva breathes within her breast, In wond'rous arts than woman more renown'd, And more than woman with deep wisdom crown'd; Tho' Tyro nor Mycene match her Name, Nor great Alcmena, (the proud boasts of Fame) Yet thus by heav'n adorn'd, by heav'n's decree She shines with fatal excellence, to thee: Eustathius observes, that Antinous in the opening of his Speech throws the fault upon Penelope, to engage the favour of the multitude: But being conscious that he had said things which Penelope would resent, he extols her in the conclusion of it. He ascribes an obstinacy of virtue to her, and by this double conduct endeavours to make both Penelope and the multitude his friends. With thee, the bowl we drain, indulge the feast, 'Till righteous heav'n reclaim her stubborn breast. What tho' from pole to pole resounds her name! The son's destruction waits the mother's fame: For 'till she leaves thy court, it is decreed, Thy bowl to empty, and thy flock to bleed. While yet he speaks, Telemachus replies. Telemachus every where speaks with an openness and bravery of spirit; this speech is a testimony of it, as well as his former; he answers chiefly to the dismission of Penelope, says it would be an offence against Heaven and Earth; and concludes with a vehemence of expression, and tells Antinous that such a word, ?????, shall never fall from his tongue. The Critics have found fault with one part of the speech, as betraying a spirit of avarice and meanness in Telemachus: How to Icarius, in the bridal hour, Shall I, by waste undone, refund the dow'r? They think it unworthy of Telemachus to make the Dower of Penelope an argument against her dismission, and consequently ascribe his detention of her, not to duty, but to covetousness. To take away this objection, they point the verses in a different manner, and place a stop after ?????????, and then the sense runs thus: “I cannot consent to dismiss her who bore me, and nurs'd me in my infancy, while her husband is absent, or perhaps dead; besides, hard would be the Punishment I should suffer, if I should voluntarily send away Penelope to Icarius. Dacier dislikes this solution, and appeals to the customs of those Ages, to justify her opinion: If a son forc'd away his mother from his house, he was obliged to restore her dower, and all she brought in marriage to her husband: But if she retir'd voluntarily to engage in a second marriage, the dower remain'd with the son as lawful heir. This opinion of Dacier may be confirm'd from Demosthenes in his orations, ??? ???? ????? ?????? ????? ?????????????, ?????????? ??? ?????, ??? ??????????? ??? ??????. Afterwards upon the decease of her husband, leaving his family, and receiving back her portion, &amp;c. The same Author adds, that the reason why the Suitors are so urgent to send away Penelope, is that she may chuse to marry some one of them, rather than return to Icarius; so that Telemachus only takes hold of their argument for her dismission, in order to detain her. They address'd Penelope more for the sake of her riches than her beauty, (for she must be about forty years old) and he tells them, that if he sends her away against her consent, he must restore those riches, which they covet more than the person of Penelope. This I confess is very refin'd; and perhaps it may be sufficient to take off the objection of covetousness in Telemachus, to understand no more than what the words at the first view seem to imply, viz. an abhorrence of their riots, describ'd by Telemachus to have risen to such a degree as to have almost ruin'd his kingdom, and made their demands impossible. I see nothing unnatural or mean in this interpretation, especially if we remember that the prodigious disorders of his family enter into the essence of the Poem. The greater the disorders are, the greater are the sufferings of Ulysses. Ev'n Nature starts, and what ye ask denies. Thus, shall I thus repay a mother's cares, Who gave me life, and nurs'd my infant years? While sad on foreign shores Ulysses treads, Or glides a ghost with unapparent shades, How to Icarius in the bridal hour Shall I, by waste undone, refund the dow'r? How from my father should I vengeance dread? There is an ambiguity in the word Father; it may either signify Icarius or Ulysses, as Eustathius observes: but I think the context determines the person to be Ulysses; for Telemachus believes him to be yet living, and consequently might fear his vengeance, if he offer'd any indignity to Penelope. How would my mother curse my hated head? And while in wrath to vengeful Fiends she cries, In the ninth Iliad we are told that the father of Phœnix imprecated the Furies against his son, My sire with curses loads my hated head, And cries “Ye Furies! barren be his bed. Infernal Jove, the vengeful Fiends below, And ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his vow. In the same book the Furies hear the curses of Althea upon her son, She beat the ground, and call'd the Pow'rs beneath, On her own son to wreak her brother's death. Hell heard her curses from the realms profound, And the fell Fiends who walk the nightly round. These passages shew the opinion the Ancients had of the honour due from children to parents, to be such, that they believ'd there were Furies particularly commission'd to punish those who fail'd in that respect, and to fulfil the imprecations made against 'em by their offended parents. There is a greatness in this Idea, and it must have had an effect upon the obedience of the youth. We see Telemachus is full of the sense of it. Dacier. How from their hell would vengeful Fiends arise? Abhorr'd by all, accurs'd my name would grow, The earth's disgrace, and Humankind my foe. If this displease, why urge ye here your stay? Haste from the court, ye spoilers, haste away: Waste in wild riot what your land allows, There ply the early feast, and late carouse. But if, to honour lost, 'tis still decreed For you my bowl shall flow, my flocks shall bleed; Judge and assert my right, impartial Jove! By him, and all th'immortal host above, (A sacred oath) if heav'n the pow'r supply, Vengeance I vow, and for your wrongs ye die. With that, two Eagles from a mountain's height This prodigy is usher'd in very magnificently, and the verses are lofty and sonorous. The Eagles are Ulysses and Telemachus; By Jove's command they fly from a mountain's height: this denotes that the two Heroes are inspir'd by Jupiter, and come from the country to the destruction of the Suitors: The eagles fly with wing to wing conjoin'd; this shews, that they act in concert, and unity of councils: At first they float upon the wind; this implies the calmness and secresy of the approach of those Heroes: At last they clang their wings, and hovering beat the skies; this shews the violence of the assault: With ardent eyes the rival train they threat. This, as the Poet himself interprets it, denotes the approaching fate of the Suitors. Then sailing o'er the domes and tow'rs they fly Full toward the East; this signifies that the Suitors alone are not doom'd to destruction, but that the men of Ithaca are involv'd in danger, as Halitherses interprets it. Nor to the Great alone is death decreed; We, and our guilty Ithaca must bleed. See here the natural explication of this prodigy, which is very ingenious! Eustathius, verbatim. By Jove's command direct their rapid flight; Swift they descend, with wing to wing conjoin'd, Stretch their broad plumes, and float upon the wind. Above th'assembled Peers they wheel on high, And clang their wings, and hovering beat the sky; With ardent eyes the rival train they threat, And shrieking loud, denounce approaching fate. They cuff, they tear; their cheeks and necks they rend, And from their plumes huge drops of blood descend: Then sailing o'er the domes and tow'rs they fly, Full tow'rd the East, and mount into the sky. The wond'ring Rivals gaze with cares opprest, And chilling horrours freeze in every breast. Till big with knowledge of approaching woes The Prince of Augurs, Halitherses, rose: Prescient he view'd th'aerial tracts, and drew A sure presage from ev'ry wing that flew. Ye sons (he cry'd) of Ithaca give ear, Hear all! but chiefly you, oh Rivals! hear. Destruction sure o'er all your heads impends; Ulysses comes, and death his steps attends. Nor to the Great alone is death decreed; We, and our guilty Ithaca must bleed. Why cease we then the wrath of heav'n to stay? Be humbled all, and lead, ye Great! the way. For lo! my words no fancy'd woes relate: I speak from science, and the voice is Fate. When great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores To shake with war proud Ilion's lofty tow'rs, Deeds then undone my faithful tongue foretold; Heav'n seal'd my words, and you those deeds behold. I see (I cry'd) his woes, a countless train; In three lines (observes Eustathius) the Poet gives us the whole Odyssey in Miniature: And it is wonderful to think, that so plain a subject should produce such variety in the process of it. Aristotle observes the simplicity of Homer's platform; which is no more than this: A Prince is absent from his country; Neptune destroys his companions; in his absence his family is disorder'd by many Princes that address his wife, and plot against the life of his only son, but at last after many storms he returns, punishes the Suitors, and re-establishes his affairs: This is all that is essential to the Poem, the rest of it is made up of Episodes. And yet with what miracles of Poetry (speciosa miracula, as Horace stiles them,) has he furnish'd out his Poem? I see his friends o'erwhelm'd beneath the main; How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams; Now twice ten years are past, and now he comes! To whom Eurymachus—Fly Dotard, fly! It has been observ'd, that Homer is the father of Oratory as well as Poetry; and it must be confess'd, that there is not any one branch of it that is not to be found in his Poetry. The Invective, Persuasive, Ironical, &amp;c. may all be gather'd from it. Nothing can be better adapted to the purpose than this speech of Eurymachus: He is to decry the credit of the predictions of Halitherses: he derides, he threats, and describes him as a venal Prophet. He is speaking to the multitude, and endeavours to bring Halitherses into contempt, and in order to it he uses him contemptuously. With thy wise dreams, and fables of the sky. Go prophesy at home; thy sons advise: Here thou art sage in vain—I better read the skies. Unnumber'd Birds glide thro' th'aerial way, Vagrants of air, and unforeboding stray. Cold in the tomb, or in the deeps below Ulysses lies: oh wert thou laid as low! Then would that busy head no broils suggest, Nor fire to rage Telemachus's breast. From him some bribe thy venal tongue requires, And Int'rest, not the God, thy voice inspires. His guide-less youth, if thy experienc'd age Mislead fallacious into idle rage, Vengeance deserv'd thy malice shall repress, And but augment the wrongs thou would'st redress. Telemachus may bid the Queen repair To great Icarius, whose paternal care Will guide her passion, and reward her choice, With wealthy dow'r, and bridal gifts of price. 'Till she retires, determin'd we remain, And both the Prince and Augur threat in vain: His pride of words, and thy wild dream of fate, Move not the brave, or only move their hate. Threat on, oh Prince! elude the bridal day, Threat on, 'till all thy stores in waste decay. True, Greece affords a train of lovely dames, In wealth and beauty worthy of our flames: But never from this nobler suit we cease; For wealth and beauty less than virtue please. To whom the Youth. Since then in vain I tell My num'rous woes, in silence let them dwell. But heav'n, and all the Greeks, have heard my wrongs: It is necessary for the Reader to carry in his mind, that this Assembly consists not only of the Peers, but of the People of Ithaca: For to the People Telemachus here appeals. It is evident, that the place of the Assembly was at least open to the Air in the upper parts: for otherways how should the Eagles be visible to the Suitors? and so very plainly as to be discover'd to threat them with their eyes? There was no doubt a place set apart for Council, usually in the market: For Telemachus is said to seat himself in his father's throne, in the beginning of this book: But Ulysses had been absent twenty years; and therefore it is evident, that his throne had stood in the same place for the space of twenty years. It is past contradiction, that in Athens and other cities of Greece there were ???????????, public Halls for the consultation of affairs. To heav'n, and all the Greeks, redress belongs. Yet this I ask (nor be it ask'd in vain) A bark to waft me o'er the rolling main; The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore, And seek my royal sire from shore to shore: If, or to Fame his doubtful fate be known, Or to be learn'd from Oracles alone? If yet he lives, with patience I forbear 'Till the fleet hours restore the circling year; But if already wand'ring in the train Of empty shades, I measure back the main; Plant the fair column o'er the mighty dead, And yield his consort to the nuptial bed. He ceas'd; and while abash'd the Peers attend, Mentor arose, Ulysses' faithful friend: The name of Mentor is another instance of the gratitude of our Poet's temper, it being the same which belong'd to a friend of his by whom he was entertain'd in Ithaca, during a defluxion on his eyes which seiz'd him in his voyages: and at whose house he is said to have laid the plan of this Poem. This character of Mentor is well sustain'd by his speech, and by the assistance he gratefully gives to young Telemachus on all occasions. [When fierce in arms he sought the scenes of war, “My friend (he cry'd) my palace be thy care; “Years roll'd on years my god-like sire decay, “Guard thou his age, and his behests obey.] The original says only, “Obey the old man. Eustathius rightly determines, that the expression means Laertes. The Poet loses no opportunity of giving Ulysses an excellent character; this is as necessary as continually to repeat the disorders of the Suitors. ? Servetur ad imum Qualis ab incœpto processerit, &amp; sibi constet. This conduct contributes admirably to the design of the Poem; and when the Poet in the unravelling of his Fable comes to reward and punish the chief actors, we acknowledge his justice in the death of the Suitors, and re-establishment of Ulysses. Stern as he rose, he cast his eyes around That flash'd with rage; and as he spoke, he frown'd. O never, never more! let King be just, Be mild in pow'r, or faithful to his trust! Let Tyrants govern with an iron rod, Oppress, destroy, and be the scourge of God; Since he who like a father held his rein, So soon forgot, was just and mild in vain! True, while my friend is griev'd, his griefs I share; Yet now the Rivals are my smallest care: They, for the mighty mischiefs they devise, Ere long shall pay—their forfeit lives the price. But against you, ye Greeks! ye coward train, Gods! how my soul is mov'd with just disdain? Dumb ye all stand, and not one tongue affords His injur'd Prince the little aid of words. While yet he spoke, Leocritus rejoyn'd: O pride of words, and arrogance of mind! Would'st thou to rise in arms the Greeks advise? Join all your pow'rs! in arms, ye Greeks, arise! Yet would your pow'rs in vain our strength oppose; The valiant few o'ermatch an host of foes. Should great Ulysses stern appear in arms, While the bowl circles, and the banquet warms; The original is not without obscurity: it says, ???? ?????: or, in the time of the banquet. Eustathius interprets it, ??? ????? ????????????? ??????, The Wine as it were fighting on their side; and this agrees with what follows. The design of this speech is to deter the people of Ithaca from rising in the cause of Ulysses: Mentor speaks justly; Leocritus insolently. Mentor sets before them the worth of Ulysses; Leocritus the power of the Suitors: Mentor speaks like a brave man; Leocritus (observes Eustathius) like a coward, who wanting true courage, flies to the assistance of wine to raise a false one. Perhaps it may be objected, that there is not a sufficient distinction in the characters of the several Suitors; they are all describ'd as insolent voluptuaries. But tho' they agree in this general character, yet there is something distinguishing in the particular persons: Thus Antinous derides, Eurymachus covers villainy with mildness; Antinous is ever the foremost in outrage, Eurymachus generally his second: A greater distinction is neither necessary, nor possible to be represented. What the Poet is to describe, is the insolence of the Suitors, and the disorders they create in his family and kingdom; he is oblig'd to dwell upon these circumstances, because they are essential to his design: and consequently that general resemblance of their characters, is not a fault in the Poet. Tho' to his breast his spouse with transport flies, Torn from her breast, that hour, Ulysses dies. But hence retreating to your domes repair; To arm the vessel, Mentor! be thy care, And Halitherses! thine: be each his friend; Ye lov'd the father: go, the son attend. But yet, I trust, the boaster means to stay Safe in the court, nor tempt the wat'ry way. Then, with a rushing sound, th'Assembly bend The Assembly which was conven'd by Telemachus, is broke up in a riotous manner by Leocritus, who had no right to dissolve it. This agrees with the lawless state of the country in the absence of its King, and shews (says Eustathius) that the Suitors had usurp'd the chief Authority. There is a fine contraste between the behaviour of Telemachus and that of the Suitors. They return to repeat their disorders and debauches; Telemachus retires to supplicate the Goddess of Wisdom, to assist him in his enterprizes. Thus the Poet raises the character of Telemachus; he has shew'd him to be a youth of a brave spirit, a good Speaker, and here represents him as a person of piety. Diverse their steps: the rival rout ascend The royal dome; while sad the Prince explores The neighb'ring main, and sorrowing treads the shores. There, as the waters o'er his hands he shed, The royal suppliant to Minerva pray'd, O Goddess! who descending from the skies Vouchsaf'd thy presence to my wond'ring eyes, By whose commands the raging deeps I trace, And seek my sire thro' storms and rolling seas! Hear from thy heav'ns above, oh warrior-maid! Descend once more, propitious to my aid. Without thy presence vain is thy command; Greece, and the rival train thy voice withstand. Indulgent to his pray'r, the Goddess took Sage Mentor's form, and thus like Mentor spoke. O Prince, in early youth divinely wise, This speech of Minerva is suited to encourage a young man to imitate the virtue of his father, and not to suffer himself to be overcome by any appearance of difficulties. She sets his father before his eyes, and tells him, there was never any danger which he durst not encounter; if he should suffer himself to be discouraged, he would prove himself an unworthy son of a brave Father. Dacier. Eustathius. Born, the Ulysses of thy age to rise! If to the son the father's worth descends, O'er the wide waves success thy ways attends: To tread the walks of death he stood prepar'd, And what he greatly thought, he nobly dar'd. Were not wise sons descendant of the wise, And did not Heroes from brave Heroes rise, Vain were my hopes: few sons attain the praise Of their great sires, and most their sires disgrace. But since thy veins paternal virtue fires, And all Penelope thy soul inspires, Go, and succeed! the rival's aims despise; For never, never, wicked man was wise. Blind they rejoice, tho' now, ev'n now they fall; Death hastes amain: one hour o'erwhelms them all! And lo, with speed we plow the wat'ry way; My pow'r shall guard thee, and my hand convey: The winged vessel studious I prepare, Thro' seas and realms companion of thy care. Thou to the court ascend; and to the shores (When night advances) bear the naval stores; Bread, that decaying man with strength supplies, And gen'rous wine, which thoughtful sorrow flies. Mean-while the Mariners by my command Shall speed aboard, a valiant chosen band. Wide o'er the bay, by vessel vessel rides; The best I chuse, to waft thee o'er the tides. She spoke: to his high dome the Prince returns, And as he moves, with royal anguish mourns. 'Twas riot all, among the lawless train; Boar bled by boar, and goat by goat lay slain. Arriv'd, his hand the gay Antinous prest, And thus deriding, with a smile addrest. Grieve not, oh daring Prince! that noble heart: This speech must be understood ironically: ????? ?? ???? ?? is us'd as before, and has relation to the preceding harangues of Telemachus to the people, and his intended voyage; by way of derision Antinous bids him not trouble his brave Spirit in contriving any more Orations, or in any bold attempt to find out Ulysses; or to act the Orator, or Heroe's part. The Critics have almost generally condemn'd these pieces of gayety and raillery, as unworthy of heroic Poetry: if ever they are proper, they must be so in the mouths of these Suitors; persons of no serious, or noble characters: Mirth, wine, and feasting is their constant employment; and consequently if they fall into absurdities, they act suitably to their characters. Milton, the best and greatest imitator of Homer, has follow'd him unworthily in this respect; I mean, has debased even this low raillery into greater lowness, by playing upon words and syllables. But in this place the raillery is not without its effect, by shewing the utmost contempt of Telemachus; and surely it is the lowest degree of calamity to be at once oppress'd and despis'd. Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part. Indulge the genial hour, unbend thy soul, Leave thought to Age, and drain the flowing bowl. Studious to ease thy grief, our care provides The bark, to waft thee o'er the swelling tides. Is this (returns the Prince) for mirth a time? When lawless gluttons riot, mirth's a crime; The luscious wines dishonour'd lose their taste, The song is noise, and impious is the feast. Suffice it to have spent with swift decay The wealth of Kings, and made my youth a prey. But now the wise instructions of the sage, And manly thoughts inspir'd by manly age, Teach me to feek redress for all my woe, Here, or in Pyle.—in Pyle or here, your foe. Deny your vessels; ye deny in vain; A private voyager I pass the main. Free breathe the winds, and free the billows flow, And where on earth I live, I live your foe. He spoke and frown'd, nor longer deign'd to stay, Sternly his hand withdrew, and strode away. Mean time, o'er all the dome, they quaff, they feast, Derisive taunts were spread from guest to guest, And each in jovial mood his mate addrest. Tremble ye not, oh friends! and coward fly, Doom'd by the stern Telemachus to dye? To Pyle or Sparta to demand supplies, It is observable, says Eustathius, that the Poet had in his choice several expedients to bring about the destruction of the Suitors, but he rejects them, and chuses the most difficult method, out of reverence to truth, being unwilling to falsify the Histories of Sparta and Pylos. This has a double effect; it furnishes the Poet with a series of noble incidents; and also gives an air of probability to the story of Ulysses and Telemachus. Big with revenge, the mighty warrior flies: Or comes from Ephyré with poisons fraught, And kills us all in one tremendous draught? Or who can say (his gamesome mate replies) But while the dangers of the deeps he tries, He, like his sire, may sink depriv'd of breath, And punish us unkindly by his death? What mighty labours would he then create, To seize his treasures, and divide his state, The royal Palace to the Queen convey, The Suitors allot the Palace to Penelope: it being, says Eustathius, the only thing that they cannot consume; and adds, that the expression of the Suitors concerning the labour they should undergo in dividing the substance of Ulysses, shews the wealth and abundance of that Heroe. Dacier has found out an allusion between ????? in the first speech, and ????? in the second; they differing only in one letter: She calls this a beauty, which she laments she cannot preserve in her translation. She is the only Commentator that ever was quicksighted enough to make the discovery. The words have no relation; they stand at a sufficient distance; and I believe Homer would have thought such trifling unworthy of his Poetry. So that all the honour which accrues from that observation must be ascrib'd (in this case, as in many others) to the Commentator, and not the Author. Or him she blesses in the bridal day! Mean-time the lofty rooms the Prince surveys, Where lay the treasures of th'Ithacian race: Such passages as these have ever furnish'd Critics with matter of raillery: They think such houshold cares unworthy of a King, and that this conduct suits better with vulgar persons of less fortune. I confess, such descriptions now would be ridiculous in a Poet, because unsuitable to our manners. But if we look upon such passages as pictures and exact representations of the old world, the Reader will find a sensible pleasure in them. It is a true observation, that the Iliad is chiefly suitable to the condition of Kings and Heroes; and consequently fill'd with circumstances in which the greatest part of mankind can have no concern or interest: The Odyssey is of more general use; the story of it is a series of calamities, which concern every man, as every man may feel them. We can bring the sufferings of Ulysses in some degree home to our selves, and make his condition our own; but what private person can ever be in the circumstances of Agamemnon or Achilles? What I would infer from this is, that the Reader ought not to take offence at any such descriptions, which are only mean as they differ from the fashions of the latter ages. In the Iliad, Achilles when he acts in the common offices of life, and not as an Heroe, is liable to the same objection. But if the manners of the antient ages be consider'd, we shall be reconcil'd to the actions of the ancient Heroes; and consequently to Homer. Here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blaz'd; There polish'd chests embroider'd vestures grac'd; Here jars of oil breath'd forth a rich perfume; There casks of wine in rows adorn'd the dome. (Pure flav'rous wine, by Gods in bounty giv'n, And worthy to exalt the feasts of heav'n.) Untouch'd they stood, 'till his long labours o'er The great Ulysses reach'd his native shore. A double strength of bars secur'd the gates: Fast by the door the wise Euryclea waits; Euryclea, who, great Ops! thy lineage shar'd, And watch'd all night, all day; a faithful guard. To whom the Prince. O thou, whose guardian care Euryclea was not properly the Nurse of Telemachus, but of Ulysses, so that she is call'd so not in a strict sense, but as one concern'd in his education from his infancy, and as a general appellation of honour. Telemachus here reserves the best wines for Ulysses; a lesson, (observes Eustathius) that even in the smallest matters we ought to pay a deference to our parents. These occasional and seemingly-trivial circumstances are not without their use, if not as poetical ornaments, yet as moral instructions. Nurs'd the most wretched King that breathes the air! Untouch'd and sacred may these vessels stand, 'Till great Ulysses views his native land. But by thy care twelve urns of wine be fill'd; Next these in worth, and firm those urns be seal'd; And twice ten measures of the choicest flour Prepar'd, ere yet descends the evening hour. For when the fav'ring shades of night arise, And peaceful slumbers close my mother's eyes, Me from our coast shall spreading sails convey, To seek Ulysses thro' the wat'ry way. While yet he spoke, she fill'd the walls with cries, And tears ran trickling from her aged eyes. Oh whither, whither flies my son? she cry'd, To realms, that rocks and roaring seas divide? In foreign lands thy father's days decay'd, And foreign lands contain the mighty dead. The wat'ry way ill-fated if thou try, All, all must perish, and by fraud you die! Then stay, my child! storms beat, and rolls the main; Oh beat those storms, and roll the seas in vain! Far hence (reply'd the Prince) thy fears be driv'n: Heav'n calls me forth; these counsels are of heav'n. But by the pow'rs that hate the perjur'd, swear, To keep my voyage from the royal ear, Nor uncompell'd the dang'rous truth betray, Till twice six times descends the lamp of day: It may be demanded how it was probable, (if possible) that the departure of Telemachus could be conceal'd twelve days from the knowledge of so fond a mother as Penelope? It must be allow'd, that this would not be possible except in a time of such great disorder as the Suitors created: Penelope confin'd herself almost continually within her own apartment, and very seldom appear'd publickly; so that there is no improbability in this relation. Dacier. Eustathius makes a criticism upon the words ????????? and ?????????, the former is used negatively, the latter affirmatively; namely, the former in swearing not to perform a thing, the latter to perform it. Lest the sad tale a mother's life impair, And grief destroy what time a while would spare. Thus he. The matron with uplifted eyes Attests th'all-seeing Sovereign of the skies. Then studious she prepares the choicest flour, The strength of wheat, and wines, an ample store. While to the rival train the Prince returns, The martial Goddess with impatience burns; Like thee, Telemachus, in voice and size, With speed divine from street to street she flies, She bids the Mariners prepar'd to stand, It is probable that this passage of Minerva preparing the Mariners, &amp;c. is thus to be understood: The men of Ithaca, retaining in memory the speech of Telemachus, and believing that what he then said, and now requests, was agreeable to justice; and having as it were his image graven upon their hearts; voluntarily resolve to lend him assiststance: So that Minerva is to be taken allegorically, to imply that it was every person's own Reason that induced him to assist Telemachus. Eustathius. When Night descends, embodied on the strand. Then to Noemon swift she runs, she flies, And asks a bark: the chief a bark supplies. It may be ask'd why this particularity is necessary, and may it not be thought that such a little circumstance is insignificant? The answer is, that a great deal depends upon this particularity; no less than the discovery of the voyage of Telemachus to the Suitors; and consequently, whatever the Suitors act in order to intercept him takes its rise from this little incident; the fountain is indeed small, but a large stream of Poetry flows from it. And now, declining with his sloping wheels, Down sunk the Sun behind the western hills. The Goddess shov'd the vessel from the shores, And stow'd within its womb the naval stores. Full in the openings of the spacious main It rides; and now descends the sailor train. Next, to the court, impatient of delay With rapid step the Goddess urg'd her way: There ev'ry eye with slumbrous chains she bound, The words in the original are ?????? and ?????, which are not to be taken for being asleep, but drowzy; this is evident from the usage of ?????????, in the conclusion of the first book of the Iliad, where the signification has been mistaken by most translators: They make Jupiter there to be asleep; tho' two lines afterwards, in the second book, Homer expressly says, Th'Immortals slumber'd on their thrones above: All, but the ever-waking eyes of Jove. It may be ask'd how Minerva can be said to occasion this drowziness in the Suitors, and make them retire sooner than usual? Eustathius replies, that the person who furnish'd the wine supply'd it in greater quantities than ordinary, thro' which wine they contracted a drowziness: In this sense Minerva, or Wisdom, may be said to assist the designs of Telemachus. And dash'd the flowing goblet to the ground. Drowzy they rose, with heavy fumes opprest, Reel'd from the palace, and retir'd to rest. Then thus, in Mentor's rev'rend form array'd, Spoke to Telemachus the martial Maid. Lo! on the seas prepar'd the vessel stands; Th'impatient mariner thy speed demands, Swift as she spoke, with rapid pace she leads. The footsteps of the Deity he treads. Swift to the shore they move: Along the strand The ready vessel rides, the sailors ready stand. He bids them bring their stores: th'attending train Load the tall bark, and launch into the main. The Prince and Goddess to the stern ascend; To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend. Full from the West she bids fresh breezes blow; This also is an allegory, and implies that the sailors had the experience and art to guide the ship before the winds; but Poetry, that delights to raise every circumstance, exalts it into the marvellous, and ascribes it to the Goddess of Wisdom. Eustathius. The sable billows foam and roar below. The Chief his orders gives; th'obedient band With due observance wait the chief's command; With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind It is observable, that Homer never passes by an opportunity of describing the sea, or a ship under sail; (and in many other places, as well as in this, he dwells largely upon it:) I take the reason to be, not only because it furnish'd him with variety of poetical images, but because he himself having made frequent voyages, had a full Idea of it, and consequently was delighted with it: This is evident from his conduct in the Iliad, where variety of allusions and similitudes are drawn from the Sea, and are not the smallest ornaments of his Poetry. The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind. High o'er the roaring waves the spreading sails Bow the tall mast, and swell before the gales; The crooked keel the parting surge divides, And to the stern retreating roll the tides. And now they ship their oars, and crown with wine This custom of libations was frequent upon all solemn occasions, before meat, before sleep, voyages, journeys; and in all religious rites, sacrifices, &amp;c. They were always made with wine, pure and unmix'd, whence ??????? is a word frequent in ancient Authors. Sometimes they used mixed wine in Sacrifices; but Eustathius says, that this mixture was of wine with wine, and not of wine with water; hence came the distinction of ?????????, and ????????, the unlawful and lawful libation; wine unmix'd was lawful, the mix'd unlawful. Homer in this place uses ?????????? ???????, or Goblets crown'd with wine; that is, fill'd 'till the wine stood above the brim of the Goblet: they esteem'd it an irreverence to the Gods not to fill the cups full, for then only they esteem'd the libation whole and perfect, ???? ??? ???????. This Book takes up the space of one day and one night: it opens with the morning; the speeches in the Council, with the preparations for the voyage of Telemachus, are the subject of the day; and the voyage is finish'd by the next morning. By this last circumstance we may learn that Ithaca was distant from Pylos but one night's voyage, nay something less, there being some time spent after the setting of the Sun, in carrying the provisions from the Palace to the vessel. The book consists chiefly in the speeches of Telemachus and his friends, against those of the Suitors. It shews the great judgment of the Poet in chusing this method: hence we see the causes preceding the effects; and know from what spring every action flow'd: we are never at a loss for a reason for every incidents the speeches are as it were the ground-work upon which he builds all that relates to the adventures of Telemachus. In the Iliad, after the dissolution of the Council in the first book, and the dissention between Agamemnon and Achilles, we immediately see upon what hinge the fable turns. So in the Odyssey, after the Poet has laid before us the warm debates between the Suitors and Telemachus, we immediately expect them to act as enemies: The war is declar'd, and we become judges as well as spectators of the scenes of action. Thus Homer adds the perspicuity of History to the ornaments of Poetry. The holy Goblet to the pow'rs divine: Imploring all the Gods that reign above, But chief, the blue-ey'd Progeny of Jove. Thus all the night they stem the liquid way, And end their voyage with the morning ray. THE THIRD BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Interview of Telemachus and Nestor. Telemachus, guided by Pallas in the shape of Mentor, arrives in the morning at Pylos; where Nestor and his sons are sacrificing on the sea-shore to Neptune. Telemachus declares the occasion of his coming, and Nestor relates what past in their return from Troy, how their fleets were separated, and he never since heard of Ulysses. They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon, the revenge of Orestes, and the injuries of the Suitors. Nestor advises him to go to Sparta and enquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an Eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the Palace. The next morning they sacrifice a Bullock to Minerva, and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus. The Scene lyes on the Sea-shore of Pylos. The scene is now remov'd from Ithaca to Pylos, and with it a new vein of Poetry is opened: Instead of the riots of the Suitors, we are entertain'd with the wisdom and piety of Nestor. This and the following book are a kind of Supplement to the Iliad; the nature of Epic Poetry requires that something should be left to the imagination of the Reader, nor is the picture to be entirely drawn at full length. Homer therefore, to satisfy our curiosity, gives an account of the fortunes of those great men, who made so noble a figure at the siege of Troy. This conduct also shews his art: Variety gives life and delight; and it is much more necessary in Epic than in Comic or Tragic Poetry sometimes to shift the Scenes, to diversify and embellish the story. But as on the stage the Poet ought not to step at once from one part of the world to a too remote country, (for this destroys credibility, and the auditor cannot fancy himself this minute here, and the next a thousand miles distant) so in Epic Poetry, every removal must be within the degrees of probability. We have here a very easy transition; the Poet carries his Heroe no further than he really might sail in the compass of time he allots for his voyage. If he had still dwelt upon the disorders of the Suitors without interruption, he must grow tiresome; but he artfully breaks the thread of their story with beautiful incidents and Episodes, and reserves the further recital of their disorders for the end of his Poem: By this method we sit down with fresh appetite to the entertainment, and rise at last not cloy'd, but satisfied. The sacred Sun, above the waters rais'd, Thro' Heav'n's eternal, brazen portals blaz'd; The original calls Heaven ??????????, or brazen; the reason of it arises either from the Palaces of the Gods being built of brass by Vulcan; or rather the word implies no more than the Stability of Heaven, which for the same reason is in other places call'd ?????????, or fram'd of iron. Eustathius. And wide o'er earth diffus'd his chearing ray, To Gods and men to give the golden day. Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls, Before old Neleus' venerable walls. There, suppliant to the Monarch of the flood, At nine green Theatres It may be ask'd why the Poet is so very particular as to mention that the Pylians were divided into nine assemblies; and may it not seem a circumstance of no importance? Eustathius answers from the Antients, that there were nine cities subject to the power of Nestor: five in Pylos, the rest in Bœotia; the Poet therefore allots one Bank or Theatre to every city, which consisted of 500 men, the whole number amounting to 4500: These cities furnish'd the like complement of men to Nestor for the war at Troy: He sail'd in ninety vessels, and allowing fifty men to each vessel, they amount to that number. Hence it appears that this was a national sacrifice, every city furnish'd nine bulls, and by consequence the whole nation were partakers of it. the Pylians stood, Tis was a very solemn sacrifice of the Pylians; How comes it then to pass, that Homer passes it over in one line? Eustathius answers, that the occasion disallows a longer description, and Homer knows when to speak, and when to be silent. He chuses to carry on the adventures of Telemachus, rather than amuse himself in descriptions that contribute nothing to the story; he finds a time of more leisure in the latter part of this book, and there he describes it at length. They taste the entrails; that is, every person eat a small portion of the sacrifice, and by this method every person became partaker of it. There is nothing in Homer that shews where this sacrifice was offer'd, whether in a Temple, or in the open air. But Eustathius tells us from Strabo, that it was in the Temple of Samian Neptune, ?? ???? ?????? ??????????. Each held five hundred, (a deputed train) At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain. They taste the entrails, and the altars load With smoaking thighs, an offering to the God. Full for the port the Ithacensians stand, And furl their sails, and issue on the land. Telemachus already prest the shore; Not first, the Pow'r of Wisdom march'd before, And ere the sacrificing throng he join'd, Admonish'd thus his well-attending mind. Proceed, my son! this youthful shame expel; An honest business never blush to tell. To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain, We past the wide, immeasurable main. Meet then the Senior far renown'd for sense, With rev'rent awe, but decent confidence: Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies; This sentiment is truly noble, and as nobly expressed: the simplicity of the diction corresponds with that of the thought. Homer in many places testifies the utmost abhorrence of a Lye. This verse is twice repeated in the present book, as well as in some others; and nothing can be stronger in the same view than that of Achilles in the 9?? Iliad, Who dares think one thing, and another tell, My heart detests him as the gates of hell. And sure he will: For Wisdom never lies. Oh tell me, Mentor! tell me, faithful guide, (The youth with prudent modesty reply'd) How shall I meet, or how accost the Sage, Unskill'd in speech, nor yet mature of age? Awful th'approach, and hard the task appears, To question wisely men of riper years. To whom the martial Goddess thus rejoin'd. Search, for some thoughts, thy own suggesting mind; And others, dictated by heav'nly pow'r, Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour. For nought unprosp'rous shall thy ways attend, Born with good omens, and with heav'n thy friend. There is some obscurity in the Greek expression, and the ancient Critics have made it more obscure by their false interpretations; they imagine that the Poet only meant to say that Telemachus was the legitimate son of Penelope and Ulysses. Eustathius. Dacier very justly condemns this explication, as unworthy of Homer; and gives us a more plain and natural interpretation: viz. “You were not born in despight of the Gods, that is, you are well made, and of a good presence, you have good inclinations, and in a word, your birth is happy.” She explains ???????? after the same manner: “You were not educated in despight of “the Gods;” that is, “the Gods have blessed your education:” This explication seems to be just, and answers perfectly the design of Minerva; which was to give a decent assurance to Telemachus. You are a person, says the Goddess, of a good presence, and happy education, why then should you be ashamed to appear before Nestor? She spoke, and led the way with swiftest speed: As swift, the youth pursu'd the way she led; And join'd the band before the sacred fire, Where sat, encompast with his sons, the Sire. The youth of Pylos, some on pointed wood Transfix'd the fragments, some prepar'd the food. In friendly throngs they gather to embrace Their unknown guests, and at the banquet place. Pisistratus was first, to grasp their hands, And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands; It is with pleasure that I read such passages in an Author of so great antiquity, as are pictures of the simplicity of those heroic ages: It is the remark of Eustathius, that Pisistratus the son of a King does not seat these strangers upon purple Tapestry, or any other costly furniture, but upon the skins of beasts, that had nothing to recommend them but their softness; being spread upon the sand of the sea shores. This whole passage pleases me extremely; there is a spirit of true Devotion, Morality and good Sense in it; and the decency of behaviour between Nestor and Telemachus is describ'd very happily: Nestor shews great benevolence to Telemachus; Telemachus great reverence to Nestor: the modesty of the one, and the humanity of the other, are worthy of our observation. We see the same picture of Nestor in the Odyssey that was drawn of him in the Iliads, with this only difference, that there he was a Counsellor of War, here he is painted in softer colours, ruling his people in peace, and diffusing a spirit of piety thro' his whole territories. He had now surviv'd the war of Troy almost ten years; and the Gods reward the old age of this wise and religious Prince with peace and happiness. Along the shore th'illustrious pair he led, Where Nestor sat with youthful Thrasymed. To each a portion of the Feast he bore, And held the golden goblet foaming o'er; Then first approaching to the elder guest, The latent Goddess in these words addrest. Whoe'er thou art, whom fortune brings to keep These rites of Neptune, monarch of the deep, Thee first it fits, oh stranger! to prepare The due libation and the solemn pray'r: Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine; Tho' much thy younger, and his years like mine, He too, I deem, implores the pow'rs divine: For all mankind alike require their grace, All born to want; a miserable race! He spake, and to her hand preferr'd the bowl: A secret pleasure touch'd Athena's soul, To see the pref'rence due to sacred age Regarded ever by the just and sage. Of Ocean's King she then implores the grace. Oh thou! whose arms this ample globe embrace, Fullfil our wish, and let thy glory shine On Nestor first, and Nestor's royal line; Next grant the Pylian states their just desires, Pleas'd with their Hecatomb's ascending fires; Last deign Telemachus and me to bless, Since Minerva here mentions the name of Telemachus in her prayer; how comes it to pass, that Nestor is at a loss to know Telemachus? Minerva sat close by Nestor; he must therefore be suppos'd to hear the prayer; and yet in the following lines he enquires who these strangers are? We can scarce imagine Nestor ignorant that the son of Ulysses was named Telemachus, there being so strict a friendship between Nestor and Ulysses. Perhaps therefore Minerva pray'd in secret mentally; or perhaps Nestor might not take notice of what was not addrest immediately to him, and consequently make enquiry about it for the greater certainty. And crown our voyage with desir'd success. Thus she; and having paid the rite divine, Gave to Ulysses' son the rosy wine. Suppliant he pray'd. And now the victims drest They draw, divide, and celebrate the feast. The banquet done, the Narrative old man Thus mild, the pleasing conference began. Now, gentle guests! the genial banquet o'er, It fits to ask ye, what your native shore, And whence your race? on what adventure, say, Thus far ye wander thro' the watry way? Relate, if business, or the thirst of gain If we form our images of persons and actions in ancient times, from the images of persons and actions in modern ages, we shall fall into great mistakes: Thus in the present passage, if we annex the same idea of Pyracy, as it was practis'd three thousand years past, to Pyracy as it is practis'd in our ages; what can be a greater affront than this enquiry of Nestor? But, says Eustathius, Pyracy was formerly not only accounted lawful, but honourable. I doubt not but Thucydides had this passage in view, when he says, that the ancient Poets introduce men enquiring of those who frequent the sea, if they be Pyrates, as a thing no way ignominious. Thucydides tells us in the same place, that all those who liv'd on the sea-coast, or in the Islands, maintain'd themselves by frequent inroads upon unfortify'd towns, and if such pyracies were nobly perform'd, they were accounted glorious. Herodotus also writes, that many of the ancients, especially about Thrace, thought it ignominious to live by labouring the ground, but to live by pyracy and plunder was esteem'd a life of honour. Eustathius. Engage your journey o'er the pathless main? Where savage Pyrates seek thro' seas unknown The lives of others, vent'rous of their own. Urg'd by the precepts by the Goddess giv'n, And fill'd with confidence infus'd from heav'n, The Youth, whom Pallas destin'd to be wise And fam'd among the sons of men, replies. Enquir'st thou, father! from what coast we came? (Oh grace and glory of the Grecian name!) From where high Ithaca o'erlooks the floods, Brown with o'er-arching shades and pendent woods. Us to these shores our filial duty draws, A private sorrow, not a publick cause. My sire I seek, where-e'er the voice of fame Has told the glories of his noble name, The great Ulysses; fam'd from shore to shore For valour much, for hardy suff'ring more. Long time with thee before proud Ilion's wall In arms he fought; with thee beheld her fall. Of all the chiefs, this Heroe's fate alone Has Jove reserv'd, unheard of, and unknown; Whether in fields by hostile fury slain, Or sunk by tempests in the gulphy main? Of this to learn, opprest with tender fears Lo at thy knee his suppliant son appears. If or thy certain eye, or curious ear Have learn't his fate, the whole dark story clear: And oh! whate'er heav'n destin'd to betide Let neither flatt'ry smooth, nor pity hide. Prepar'd I stand: he was but born to try The lot of man; to suffer, and to die. Oh then, if ever thro' the ten years war The wise, the good Ulysses claim'd thy care; If e'er he join'd thy council, or thy sword, True in his deed, and constant to his word; Far as thy mind thro' backward time can see, Search all thy stores of faithful memory: 'Tis sacred truth I ask, and ask of thee. To him experienc'd Nestor thus rejoin'd. Eustathius observes the modesty of Nestor: Telemachus had ascrib'd the fall of Troy in a great measure to Nestor; but Nestor speaks not in particular of himself, but is content with his share of glory in common with other warriors; he speaks in the plural number, and joins all the Greeks as in the war, so in the glory of it. Nestor mentions the sufferings of the Greeks by sea, as well as by land, during the siege of Troy: To understand this, it is necessary to remember, that the Greeks made many expeditions against other places during the war, both by sea and land, as appears from many passages in the Iliads, particularly from what Achilles says in the ninth book. O friend! what sorrows dost thou bring to mind? Shall I the long, laborious scene review, And open all the wounds of Greece anew? What toils by sea! where dark in quest of prey Dauntless we rov'd; Achilles led the way: What toils by land! where mixt in fatal fight Such numbers fell, such Heroes sunk to night: There Ajax great, Achilles there the brave, I have observ'd, that the Poet inserts into the Odyssey several incidents that happen'd after the fall of Troy, and by that method agreeably diversifies his Poetry, and satisfies the curiosity of the Reader. Eustathius remarks here, that he gives a title of honour to all the Heroes he mentions, except only to Achilles. Achilles had been the occasion of the sufferings and death of many of the Greeks by his anger, and obstinacy in refusing to obey Agamemnon; therefore while Nestor is lamenting the calamities of the Greeks, he passes over Achilles without any honourable mention, who had so greatly added to their sufferings. But I think this remark chimerical: one may as well say Achilles needed no Epithet to distinguish him. It is with pleasure I see the old man dwell upon the praise of Antilochus: The father enlarges upon the fame of the son; he gives him four epithets of glory; and while Ajax is only praised as a warrior, Antilochus is great and good, excellent in the standing fight, or swift to pursue an enemy. Longinus has observ'd upon the beauty of this passage. There wise Patroclus, fill an early grave: There too my son—ah once my best delight, Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight, In whom stern courage with soft virtue join'd, A faultless body, and a blameless mind: Antilochus—what more can I relate? How trace the tedious series of our fate? Not added years on years my task could close, The long historian of my country's woes: Back to thy native Islands might'st thou sail, And leave half-heard the melancholy tale. Nine painful years, on that detested shore What stratagems we form'd, what toils we bore? Still lab'ring on, 'till scarce at last we found Great Jove propitious, and our conquest crown'd, Far o'er the rest thy mighty father shin'd, Nestor speaks of Ulysses as an inseparable friend; and it shews an excellent disposition in them both, to be rivals, and yet without envy. But the art of Nestor is remarkable, he first gives the character to Ulysses of being superior in wisdom to all the Greeks; and yet at last he finds a way secretly to set himself on a level with him, if not above him: We ever, says he, thought the same thoughts, and were ever of the same sentiments: which tho' it may imply that they were of equal wisdom; yet there is room left for it to signify, that Ulysses always assented to the wisdom of Nestor. Eust. In wit, in prudence, and in force of mind. Art thou the son of that illustrious sire? With joy I grasp thee, and with love admire. So like your voices, and your words so wise, Who finds thee younger must consult his eyes. Thy Sire and I were one; nor vary'd aught In publick sentence, or in private thought; Alike to Council or th'Assembly came, There is a remarkable difference between ????? and ?????. The former denotes a select number of men assembled in council; the latter a public assembly where all the people were present. Eustathius. With equal souls, and sentiments the same. But when (by wisdom won) proud Ilion burn'd, And in their ships the conqu'ring Greeks return'd; 'Twas God's high will the victors to divide, And turn th'event, confounding human pride: Some he destroy'd, some scatter'd as the dust, (Not all were prudent, and not all were just) Then Discord, sent by Pallas from above, Nestor in modesty conceals the reason of the anger of the Goddess; out of respect to Ajax the Locrian who was then dead: The crime of Ajax was the violation of Cassandra even in the temple of Minerva before her image. But why should the Goddess be angry at others for the crime of Ajax? this is because they omitted to punish the offender. If Ajax was criminal in offending, others are criminal for not punishing the offence. Eustathius. The crime of Ajax is mention'd in Virgil. Æn. 1. ? Pallasnè exurere classem Argivum, atque ipsos potuit submergere ponto, Unius ob noxam, &amp; furias Ajacis Oilei? &amp;c. Could angry Pallas with revengeful spleen The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men? She for the fault of one offending foe, The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw. Dryd. Virgil borrow'd the description of the punishment of Ajax from the fourth of the Odyssey. Stern Daughter of the great Avenger Jove, The Brother-Kings inspir'd with fell debate; Who call'd to council all th'Achaian state, It may seem at first view, that the Poet affirms the night to be an improper season to convene a Council. This is not his meaning; In the Iliad, there are several councils by night; nay ?? ????? ????? is used proverbially to express the best concerted councils. What therefore Nestor here condemns is the calling not a select, but public assembly of the soldiers in the night, when they are in no danger of an enemy, and when they are apt to fly into insolence thro' wine, and the joy of victory. The night is then undoubtedly an ill chosen season: because the licence of the soldier cannot be so well restrain'd by night as by day. Eustathius. But call'd untimely (not the sacred rite Observ'd, nor heedful of the setting light, Nor herald sworn, the session to proclaim) Sour with debauch, a reeling tribe they came. To these the cause of meeting they explain, And Menelaus moves to cross the main; Not so the King of Men: he will'd to stay; The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay, And calm Minerva's wrath. Oh blind to fate! It may be ask'd why Nestor condemns so solemnly this Heroe, calling him ??????, when he describes him in so pious an action? this is not because the Gods are implacable, for as Homer himself writes, ???????? ?? ??? ???? ?????; but because he vainly imagin'd that they would so soon be appeas'd, without any justice done upon the offender: ???? ?????? ??????????? are the words of Eustathius. The Gods not lightly change their love, or hate. With ire-full taunts each other they oppose, 'Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose. Now diff'rent counsels ev'ry breast divide, Each burns with rancour to the adverse side: Th'unquiet night strange projects entertain'd; (So Jove, that urg'd us to our fate, ordain'd.) We, with the rising morn our ships unmoor'd, And brought our captives and our stores aboard; But half the people with respect obey'd The King of Men, and at his bidding stay'd. Now on the wings of winds our course we keep, (For God had smooth'd the waters of the deep) For Tenedos we spread our eager oars, There land, and pay due victims to the pow'rs: To bless our safe return we join in pray'r, But angry Jove dispers'd our vows in air, And rais'd new discord. Then (so Heav'n decreed) Ulysses first and Nestor disagreed: Wise as he was, by various Counsels sway'd, It is with great address that Nestor relates the return of Ulysses to Agamemnon; he ascribes it not directly to Ulysses, but to his associates in the voyage; he mollifies it, in complaisance to Telemachus. But Nestor, according to Dacier, conceals the true reason of his return; it was not to please Agamemnon, but out of fear of the Goddess Minerva, whose statue he had taken by force from Troy: to appease that Goddess, he returns to join in sacrifice with Agamemnon. Eustathius. He there, tho' late, to please the Monarch, stay'd. But I, determin'd, stem the foamy floods, Warn'd of the coming fury of the Gods. It may be ask'd how Nestor attain'd this knowledge of the evils which the Gods were preparing? Eustathius ascribes it to his great Wisdom, which gave him an insight into futurity. Dacier with more reason tells us, that Nestor knew that Minerva had been offended, and might consequently apprehend a punishment was to be inflicted for the offence. With us Tydides fear'd, and urg'd his haste: And Menelaus came, but came the last. He join'd our vessels in the Lesbian bay, While yet we doubted of our watry way; If to the right to urge the pilot's toil, (The safer road) beside the Psyrian isle; Or the strait course to rocky Chios plow, And anchor under Mimas' shaggy brow? We sought direction of the pow'r divine: The God propitious gave the guiding sign; Thro' the mid seas he bids our navy steer, And in Eubea shun the woes we fear. The whistling winds already wak'd the sky; Before the whistling winds the vessels fly, With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way, And reach Gerestus at the point of day. There hecatombs of bulls to Neptune slain High-flaming please the monarch of the main. The fourth day shone, when all their labours o'er Tydides' vessels touch'd the wish'd-for shore: But I to Pylos scud before the gales, Eustathius observes from the Antients, that the Poet with great judgment suspends, and breaks off this relation of Nestor; by this method he has an opportunity to carry Telemachus to other countries, and insert into his Poem the story of Menelaus and Helen: This method likewise gives an air of probability to what he writes; the Poet seems afraid to deceive, and when he sends Telemachus to other parts for better intelligence, he seems to consult truth and exactness. The God still breathing on my swelling sails; Sep'rate from all, I safely landed here; Their fates or fortunes never reach'd my ear. Yet what I learn'd, attend; as here I sate, And ask'd each voyager each Heroe's fate; Curious to know, and willing to relate. Safe reach'd the Myrmidons their native land, Beneath Achilles' warlike son's command. The son of Achilles was nam'd Neoptolemus, by others Pyrrhus; his story is this: When he had reach'd Thessaly with the Myrmidons of Achilles, by the advice of Thetis he set fire to his vessels; and being warn'd by Helenus, from the oracles, to fix his habitation where he found a house whose foundations were iron, whose walls were wood, and whose roof was wool; he took his journey on foot, and coming to a certain lake of Epirus, he found some persons fixing their spears with the points downwards into the earth, and covering the tops of them with their cloaks, and after this manner making their tents: he look'd upon the Oracle as fulfill'd, and dwelt there. Afterwards having a son by Andromache the wife of Hector, he nam'd him Molossus, from whom the region took the name of Molossia. From this country are the Molossi canes, mention'd by Virgil. Eustathius. Those, whom the heir of great Apollo's art Brave Philoctetes taught to wing the dart; And those whom Idomen from Ilion's plain Had led, securely crost the dreadful main. How Agamemnon touch'd his Argive coast, And how his life by fraud and force he lost, And how the Murd'rer pay'd his forfeit breath; What lands so distant from that scene of death But trembling heard the Fame? and heard, admire How well the son appeas'd his slaughter'd sire! Ev'n to th'unhappy, that unjustly bleed, Heav'n gives Posterity t' avenge the deed. So fell Ægysthus; and may'st thou, my friend, Nestor introduces the mention of Ægysthus very artfully; it is to raise an emulation in Telemachus to revenge Ulysses, as Orestes had Agamemnon; it has the intended effect, and we find that Telemachus dwells upon his story with a virtuous envy; yet at the same time with great modesty: Eustathius gives a different reading in ? ??????????? ????????, or, ? ???????????? ??????. both the expressions are used in Homer, the preference is therefore submitted to the Reader. (On whom the virtues of thy sire descend) Make future times thy equal act adore, And be, what brave Orestes was before! The prudent youth reply'd. Oh thou the grace And lasting glory of the Grecian race! Just was the vengeance, and to latest days Shall long posterity resound the praise. Some God this arm with equal prowess bless! And the proud Suitors shall its force confess: Injurious men! who while my soul is sore Of fresh Affronts, are meditating more. But heav'n denies this honour to my hand, Nor shall my father repossess the land: The father's fortune never to return, And the sad son's to suffer and to mourn! Thus he, and Nestor took the word: My son, Is it then true, as distant rumours run, That crowds of rivals for thy mother's charms Thy Palace fill with insults and alarms? Say, is the fault, thro' tame submission, thine? Or leagu'd against thee, do thy people join, Mov'd by some Oracle, or voice divine? The words in the original are, following the voice of some God, that is, some Oracle: Homer does not confine the expression either to a good or bad sense, but the context plainly shews, that they must be understood in a bad sense; namely to imply, that the people had recourse to pretended Oracles to justify their rebellion. This is evident from what follows, where Nestor encourages Telemachus to expect that Ulysses may punish them for their crimes, ?????????? ?????— if there had been no crime, there ought to be no punishment. And yet who knows, but ripening lies in fate An hour of vengeance for th'afflicted state; When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms, Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms. The Poet shews his great judgment in preparing the Reader for the destruction of the Suitors: that great Catastrophe is manag'd by few hands, and it might seem incredible that so few could destroy so many: the Poet therefore, to give an air of truth to his action, frequently inculcates the assistance of Pallas, which must at least shew, that such a great exploit is not impossible to be executed by stratagems and valour: It is by art, not strength, that Ulysses conquers. All Greece in arms. This is spoken in a general sense, and comprehends not only the subjects of Ulysses, or even the Pylians and Spartans, but implies that all the Greeks would rise in the cause of Ulysses. What the Suitors had spoken scoffingly in the preceding book, viz. that Telemachus was sailing to Pyle or Sparta for supplies, appears in this not to be impracticable; so that it was choice and not necessity that determin'd the Poet to make use of no such easy expedients for the destruction of the Suitors. Eustathius It may be added, that the very nature of Epic Poetry, and of the Odyssey in particular, requires such a conduct: In the Iliad Achilles is the chief agent, and performs almost all the great actions; Æneas is painted after the same manner by Virgil; the one kills Hector, the other Turnus, both which are the decisive actions: It was equally necessary to exalt the character of Ulysses, by bringing him into difficulties from which he is personally to extricate himself: This the Poet sufficiently brings about by refusing all the easy methods for his re-establishment, because the more difficult ways are most conducive to the honour of his Heroe: Thus as Achilles and Æneas kill Hector and Turnus with their own hands, so the Suitors fall chiefly by the hand of Ulysses. It is necessary for the Heroe of the Poem to execute the decisive action, for by this method the Poet compleats his character, his own greatness surmounts all difficulties, and he goes off the stage with the utmost advantage, by leaving a noble character upon the mind of the spectators. But if Athena, War's triumphant maid, The happy son, will, as the father, aid, (Whose fame and safety was her constant care In ev'ry danger and in ev'ry war: Never on man did heav'nly favour shine With rays so strong, distinguish'd and divine, As those with which Minerva mark'd thy sire) So might she love thee, so thy soul inspire! Soon shou'd their hopes in humble dust be laid, And long oblivion of the bridal bed. Ah! no such hope (the Prince with sighs replies) Can touch my breast; that blessing heav'n denies. Ev'n by celestial favour were it giv'n, Fortune or fate wou'd cross the will of heav'n. It may be ask'd how an expression so near blasphemy, as Eustathius observes, could escape a person of such piety as Telemachus? 'Tis true, the Poet makes Minerva herself correct it; but yet the objection remains, viz. how could Telemachus speak it? I think since the Poet himself condemns it, we may give it up as an indecency in Telemachus; it is natural for men in despair (and that was the condition of Telemachus) to use a vehemence of expression, and this might transport Telemachus beyond the bounds of prudence. The only possible way that occurs to me to take off the impiety, is to have recourse to Destiny: It was the opinion of the Ancients, that the Gods could not alter Destiny: and then Telemachus may mean no more, than that it was decreed by the Destinies that Ulysses shall return no more, so the Gods themselves could not restore him. Thus in the 15?? of the Metamorphosis, Venus in vain applies to the Gods to preserve Julius Cæsar. ? Superosque movet, qui rumpere quanquam Ferrea non possunt veterum decreta sororum, &amp;c And a little lower Jupiter says to Venus, ? Sola insuperabile fatam, Nata, movere paras? What words are these, and what imprudence thine? (Thus interpos'd the Martial maid divine) Forgetful youth! but know, the Pow'r above With ease can save each object of his love; Wide as his will, extends his boundless grace; Nor lost in time, nor circumscrib'd by place. Happier his lot, who, many sorrows past, Nothing can be better imagin'd to encourage Telemachus, than what the Poet here delivers: She sets Agamemnon in opposition to Ulysses: Agamemnon made a speedy voyage to his country, and there fell by treachery; Ulysses has long been absent, but yet is happier than Agamemnon: the Gods perhaps reserve him for better fortunes, at least nothing can be concluded from his long absence, and this is sufficient to teach Telemachus not to despair. Eustathius. Long-lab'ring gains his natal shore at last; Than who too speedy, hastes to end his life By some stern ruffian, or adult'rous wife. Death only is the lot which none can miss, And all is possible to heav'n, but this. What Minerva here says justifies the remark I made, that what Telemachus seem'd to have spoken rashly, may be soften'd, if not vindicated, by having recourse to Destiny: It is evident from this passage, that Destiny was superior to the power of the Gods; otherwise Minerva speaks as blasphemously as Telemachus: For what difference is there between saying, that the Gods cannot preserve even these they love from death, and saying that the Gods could not save Ulysses? Why therefore may not the words of Telemachus be thought to have a respect to Destiny? I am of opinion, that the Poet had something further in view by putting these words into the mouth of Minerva: The words of Telemachus, if taken grossly, might appear shocking to so pious a person as Nestor, and make an ill impression upon him to the disadvantage of Telemachus; Minerva therefore artfully explains it, and softens the horrour of it by reconciling it to the Theology of those ages. The best, the dearest fav'rite of the sky Must taste that cup, for man is born to die. Thus check'd, reply'd Ulysses' prudent heir: Mentor, no more—the mournful thought forbear; For he no more must draw his country's breath, Already snatch'd by Fate, and the black doom of death! Pass we to other subjects; and engage Telemachus here puts several questions, as it were in a breath, to Nestor: and Platarch observes upon this passage, that he who enquires any thing of an old man, tho' the old man himself has no concern in the story, wins his heart at once; and incites a person, who is upon all occasions very willing to discourse. He introduces this as an instance of the art Telemachus uses, in adapting himself by his questions to the temper of the person with whom he converses: He puts together, continues he, several questions upon several subjects, which is more judicious than to confine his answer to a single interrogatory, and by that method deprive Nestor of one of the most pleasant enjoyments of old age, I mean the pleasure of talking. Plutarch. Symposiac. On themes remote the venerable Sage: (Who thrice has seen the perishable kind The Poet here tells us that Nestor was now in his fourth generation: Ovid took the word ????? to signify an hundred years; but then Nestor must have been above three hundred years old. Others with more probability understand it to signify a generation, or such a portion of time in which any race of men flourish together, which is computed to be about thirty years. I refer the Reader to the Note upon the 33? verse in the first book of the Iliad, for the particular age of Nestor. According to that computation, he must now be about ninety five years of age. Of men decay, and thro' three ages shin'd, Like Gods majestic, and like Gods in mind.) For much he knows, and just conclusions draws From various precedents, and various laws. O son of Neleus! awful Nestor, tell How he, the mighty, Agamemnon fell? Telemachus does not ask this question out of curiosity, but with great judgment; he knows there were designs against his life, as well as there had been against Agamemnon; he therefore asks it, that he may learn how to defeat them; chiefly to instruct himself how best to assist his father upon his return, by aiding him in escaping the snares of the Suitors. Dacier. By what strange fraud Ægysthus wrought, relate, (By force he could not) such a Heroe's fate? Liv'd Menelaus not in Greece? or where Was then the martial brother's pious care? Condemn'd perhaps some foreign shore to tread; Or sure Ægysthus had not dar'd the deed. To whom the Full of Days. Illustrious youth, Attend (tho' partly thou hast guest) the truth. For had the martial Menelaus found The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground; Nor earth had hid his carcase from the skies, Nor Grecian virgins shriek'd his obsequies, But fowls obscene dismember'd his remains, And dogs had torn him on the naked plains. While us the works of bloody Mars employ'd, The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy'd; He, stretch'd at ease in Argos' calm recess, (Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless) With flattery's insinuating art Sooth'd the frail Queen, and poyson'd all her heart. At first with worthy shame and decent pride, The royal dame his lawless suit deny'd. For Virtue's image yet possest her mind, Taught by a Master of the tuneful kind: Homer thro' the whole Odyssey speaks much in honour of the Art which he himself loved, and in which he so eminently excell'd: From these and other passages we may learn the state of Poetry in those ages: “Poets (says Eustathius) were rank'd in the class of Philosophers; and the Ancients made use of them as Præceptors in Music and Morality.” Strabo quotes this very passage as an instance of the excellence of Poetry in forming the soul to worthy actions: Ægysthus could not debauch Clytemnestra, 'till he banish'd the Poet, who was her guide and instructor. Various are the conjectures of the Ancients about the name of the Bard here celebrated: Some, says Eustathius, tell us, it was Chariades, some Demodocus, some Glaucus, &amp;c. but I pass them over, because they are conjectures. There were many degrees of these ??????; some were ?????? ??????, others ?????? ???? ??????: But such Bards as are here mention'd were of an higher station, and retain'd as instructors by Kings and Princes. I cannot omit one remark of Eustathius: he tells us, that some persons write that these ?????? had their names from hence, ?? ?????? ?? ???????; exactly resembling the modern Italian singers: Madam Dacier is not to be forgiven for passing over a remark of such importance; If this be true, it makes a great difference between the ancient and modern Poets, and is the only advantage I know we have over them. Atrides, parting for the Trojan war, Consign'd the youthful consort to his care; True to his charge, the Bard preserv'd her long In honour's limits (such the pow'r of Song) But when the Gods these objects of their hate Dragg'd to destruction, by the links of fate; The bard they banish'd from his native soil, And left all helpless in a desart isle: There he, the sweetest of the sacred train, Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain. Then Virtue was no more (her guard away) There is a fine moral couch'd in the story of the Bard and Clytemnestra; it admirably paints the advantage we draw from wise companions for the improvement of our Virtues: Clytemnestra was chaste because her instructor was wise: His wisdom was an insuperable guard to her modesty. It was long before she yielded; virtue and honour had a long contest: but she no sooner yielded to adultery, but she assisted in the murder of her husband; from whence we may draw another moral, that one vice betrays us into another; and when once the fences of honour are thrown down, we become a prey to every passion. Dacier. She fell, to lust a voluntary prey. Ev'n to the temple stalk'd th'adult'rous spouse, Here is a surprizing mixture of religion and impiety: Ægysthus, upon the accomplishment of so great a crime as adultery, returns thanks to the Gods by oblations, as if they had assisted him in the execution of it. Nestor dwells upon it at large, to shew that Ægysthus greatly aggravated his guilt by such a piece of impious devotion. Dacier. With impious thanks, and mockery of vows, With images, with garments, and with gold, And od'rous fumes from loaded altars roll'd. Mean time from flaming Troy we cut the way, With Menelaus, thro' the curling sea. But when to Sunium's sacred point we came, Crown'd with the temple of th'Athenian dame; Atrides' pilot, Phrontes, there expir'd; (Phrontes, of all the sons of men admir'd To steer the bounding bark with steddy toil, When the storm thickens, and the billows boil) While yet he exercis'd the steerman's art, Apollo touch'd him with his gentle dart; Homer calls the darts of Apollo ?????, or gentle; to signify that those who dye thus suddenly, die without pain. Eustathius. Dacier complains that some Critics think Homer worthy of blame for enlarging upon so mean a person as a pilot. It is a sufficient answer to observe, that arts were in high esteem in those times, and men that were eminent in them were in great honour. Neither were arts then confin'd as in these ages to mean personages: no less a person than Ulysses builds a vessel in the sequel of the Odyssey; so that this is a false piece of delicacy. If Homer be culpable, so is Virgil; he gives the genealogy of Palinurus, as well as Homer of Phrontes. Virgil's description is censur'd as too long, Homer concludes his in seven lines; and lastly, Virgil's Episode has been judg'd by the Critics to be an unnecessary ornament, and to contribute nothing to the Poem: Homer relates the death of Phrontis, to introduce the dispersion of the fleet of Menelaus; the fleet might well be scatter'd, when it wanted so excellent a pilot. Ev'n with the rudder in his hand, he fell. To pay whose honours to the Shades of hell, We check'd our haste, by pious office bound, And laid our old companion in the ground. And now, the rites discharg'd, our course we keep Far on the gloomy bosom of the deep: Soon as Malæa's misty tops arise, Sudden the Thund'rer blackens all the skies, And the winds whistle, and the surges roll Mountains on mountains, and obscure the pole. The tempest scatters, and divides our fleet; Part, the storm urges on the coast of Crete, Homer does not amuse us by relating what became of these companions of Menelaus; he omits this judiciously, and follows the thread of his story: Menelaus is the person whom the Poet has in view; he therefore passes over the story of his companions, to carry on the fable of the Poem by leading us directly to Menelaus. Where winding round the rich Cydonian plain, The streams of Jardan issue to the main. There stands a rock, high eminent and steep, Whose shaggy brow o'erhangs the shady deep, And views Gortyna on the western side; On this rough Auster drove th'impetuous tide: With broken force the billows rowl'd away, And heav'd the fleet into the neighb'ring bay. Thus sav'd from death they gain'd the Phæstan shores, With shatter'd vessels, and disabled oars: But five tall barks the winds and waters tost Far from their fellows, on th'Ægyptian coast. In the original it is, The wind and water carry'd them to Ægyptus. Homer by Ægyptus means the river Nile, and then it is always used in the masculine gender; the region about it took its name from the river Ægyptus, this is always used in the feminine gender; but the country had not receiv'd that name in the days of Homer. Eustathius. What Dacier adds to this observation, may assist in determining the dispute concerning the priority of Homer and Hesiod: Hesiod makes mention of the river Nilus; if therefore it be true that Ægyptus had not been called by the name of Nilus in the times of Homer, it is a demonstration that Hesiod was posterior to Homer; otherwise he could not have been acquainted with any other name but that of Ægyptus. There wander'd Menelaus thro' foreign shores, Amassing gold, and gath'ring naval stores; While curst Ægysthus the detested deed By fraud fulfill'd, and his great brother bled. Sev'n years, the traytor rich Mycenæ sway'd, And his stern rule the groaning land obey'd; The eighth, from Athens to his realm restor'd, There is a different reading in this place: instead of ??? ???????, some write ??? ??????; for Orestes was educated by Strophius King of Phocis, and father of Pylades: The Ancients reconcile the difference, by saying that Orestes might be sent from Phocis to Athens for his education, and returning thence to his own country, might revenge the death of his father Agamemnon; so that although he was first bred up in Phocis, he was afterwards a sojourner in Athens. Eustathius. Orestes brandish'd the revenging sword, Slew the dire pair, and gave to fun'ral flame The vile assassin, and adult'rous dame. That day, ere yet the bloody triumphs cease, Return'd Atrides to the coast of Greece, And safe to Argus port his navy brought, With gifts of price and pond'rous treasure fraught. Hence warn'd, my son beware! nor idly stand Too long a stranger to thy native land; Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away, While lawless feasters in thy palace sway; Perhaps may seize thy realm, and share the spoil; And thou return, with disappointed toil, From thy vain journey, to a rifled Isle. Howe'er, my friend, indulge one labour more, And seek Atrides on the Spartan shore. He, wand'ring long, a wider circle made, And many-languag'd nations has survey'd; And measur'd tracts unknown to other ships, Amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps; (A length of Ocean and unbounded sky, It must be confest, that Nestor greatly exaggerates this description: Homer himself tells us, that a ship may sail in five days from Crete to Ægypt; wherefore then this Hyperbole of Nestor? It might perhaps be to deter Telemachus from a design of sailing to Crete, and he through his inexperience might believe the description. It may be added, that what Nestor speaks concerning the flight of birds, may be only said to shew the great distance of that sea: Nay, by a favourable interpretation it may be reconcil'd to truth; the meaning then must be this: Should a person observe that sea a whole year, he would not see one bird flying over it, both because of the vastness and dreadfulness of it; and perhaps the whole of this might arise from the observation, that this sea is not frequented by birds. This is wholly and almost literally taken from Eustathius; and if we add to this the ignorance of the sea and sea-affairs in those ages, we shall the less wonder to hear so wise a man as Nestor describing it with so much terror; Navigation is now greatly improv'd, and the Moderns sail further in a month, than the Ancients could in a year; their whole art consisting chiefly in coasting along the shores, and consequently they made but little way. Which scarce the Sea-fowl in a year o'erfly) Go then; to Sparta take the watry way, Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay; Or if by land thou chuse thy course to bend, My steeds, my chariots, and my sons attend: Thee to Atrides they shall safe convey, Guides of thy road, companions of thy way. Urge him with truth to frame his free replies, And sure he will: For Menelas is wise. Thus while he speaks, the ruddy sun descends, And twilight grey her ev'ning shade extends. Then thus the blue-ey'd Maid: O full of days! Wise are thy words, and just are all thy ways. Now immolate the Tongues, and mix the wine, Various are the reasons which Eustathius reports concerning this oblation of the tongues at the conclusion of the sacrifice. It was to purge themselves from any evil words they might have utter'd; or because the tongue was reckon'd the best part of the sacrifice, and so reserv'd for the completion of it; or they offer'd the tongue to the Gods, as witnesses to what they had spoken. I omit the rest as superfluous. They had a custom of offering the tongues to Mercury, because they believed him the giver of Eloquence. Dacier expatiates upon this custom. The people, says she, might fear, lest thro' wine and the joy of the festival they might have utter'd some words unbecoming the sanctity of the occasion: by this sacrifice of the tongues, they signify'd that they purged away whatever they had spoken amiss during the festival; and ask'd in particular pardon of Mercury, who presided over discourse, to the end they might not carry home any uncleanness which might stop the blessings expected from the sacrifice. Sacred to Neptune and the pow'rs divine. The lamp of day is quench'd beneath the deep, And soft approach the balmy hours of sleep: Nor fits it to prolong the heav'nly feast Eustathius shews the difference between ??????, festivals, and ??????, or sacrifices: in the former it was customary to spend the whole night in wine and rejoicing: In the latter, this was reckon'd an unlawful custom, thro' the fear of falling into any indecencies thro' wine. He likewise gives another reason of this injunction, by telling us that it was the custom to offer sacrifices to the celestial Powers in the day, and even to finish them about the setting of the sun; and that those who dealt in incantations perform'd their sacrifices to the infernal powers by night, and finish'd them before sun-rising. Either of these reasons sufficiently explains the words of the Goddess; and the former carries in it an excellent moral, that particular care should be taken in our acts of devotion, not to turn religion into impiety. Timeless, indecent, but retire to rest. So spake Jove's daughter, the celestial maid. The sober train attended and obey'd. The sacred heralds on their hands around Pour'd the full urns; the youths the goblets crown'd: From bowl to bowl the holy bev'rage flows; While to the final sacrifice they rose. The tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame, And pour, above, the consecrated stream. And now, their thirst by copious draughts allay'd, The youthful Heroe and th'Athenian maid Propose departure from the finish'd rite, And in their hollow bark to pass the night: But this the hospitable Sage deny'd. Forbid it, Jove! and all the Gods! he cry'd, Thus from my walls the much-lov'd son to send Of such a heroe, and of such a friend! Me, as some needy peasant, would ye leave, Whom heav'n denies the blessing to relieve? Me would ye leave, who boast imperial sway, When beds of royal state invite your stay? This passage gives us a full insight into the manners of these hospitable ages; they not only kept a treasury for bowls or vases of gold or silver, to give as ???????, or gifts of hospitality, but also a wardrobe of various habits and rich furniture, to lodge and bestow upon strangers. Eustathius relates, that Tellias of Agrigentum was a person of so great hospitality, that five hundred horsemen coming to his house in the winter season, he entertain'd them, and gave every man a cloak and a tunic. This laudable custom prevailed, and still prevails, in the eastern countries: it was the practice of Abraham of old, and is at this day of the Turks, as we may learn from their Caravansaries, erected for the reception of travellers. And yet Dacier observes, that a French Critic has shew'd so ill a taste as to ridicule this passage. “Telemachus (says that Author) being entertain'd by Nestor, intimates his intention of returning to lodge on ship-board with his companions: but Nestor detains him, by asking if he thought he had not quilts or coverlets to give him a Night's lodging; Upon this Telemachus goes to bed in a resounding gallery, and Nestor in a bed which his wife made ready for him.” The noblest things are most liable to burlesque, by perverting their meaning; as some pictures, by varying the position, represent a man or a monster. He is very severe upon the resounding gallery, which in truth means no more than very lofty or elevated, and by consequence very noble and magnificent. No—long as life this mortal shall inspire, Or as my children imitate their sire, Here shall the wand'ring stranger find his home, And hospitable rites adorn the dome. Well hast thou spoke (the blue-ey'd maid replies) Belov'd old man! benevolent, as wise. Be the kind dictates of thy heart obey'd, And let thy words Telemachus persuade: He to thy palace shall thy steps pursue; I to the ship, to give the orders due, Prescribe directions, and confirm the crew. For I alone sustain their naval cares, Who boast experience from these silver hairs; All youths the rest, whom to this journey move Like years, like tempers, and their Prince's love. There in the vessel shall I pass the night; And soon as morning paints the fields of light, The Poet makes a double use of these words of the Goddess; she gives an air of probability to her excuse, why she should not be press'd to stay; and at the same time Homer avoids the absurdity of introducing that Goddess at Sparta, Menelaus and Helen are celebrating the nuptials of their son and daughter: Minerva is a Virgin Deity, and consequently an enemy to all nuptial ceremonies. Eustathius. But it may be necessary to observe who these Caucons are: we find in the tenth book the Caucons mention'd as auxiliaries to Troy: There Dolon says The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host, And Leleges encamp along the coast. Are these Caucons the same with those here mention'd? Eustathius informs us, that there was a people of Triphyly, between Elis and Pylos, named Caucons: But Strabo says, that the whole race is now extinct, and that these here mention'd are of Dymæa, and take their name from the river Caucon: whereas those in the Iliad are Paphlagonians: they were a wandring nation, and consequently might be the same people originally, and retain the same name in different countries. I go to challenge from the Caucons bold, A debt, contracted in the days of old. But this thy guest, receiv'd with friendly care, Let thy strong coursers swift to Sparta bear; Prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day, And be thy son companion of his way. Then turning with the word, Minerva flies, And soars an Eagle thro' the liquid skies. Vision divine! The throng'd spectators gaze In holy wonder fixt, and still amaze. But chief the rev'rend Sage admir'd; he took It may be ask'd why Nestor is in such a surprize at the discovery of the Goddess: It is evident from the Iliad, that he had been no stranger to such intercourses of the Deities; nay, in this very book Nestor tells us, that Ulysses enjoy'd almost the constant presence of Minerva; insomuch that Sophocles, the great imitator of Homer, relates, that he knew the Goddess by her voice, without seeing her. Eustathius answers, that the wonder of Nestor arose not from the discovery of that Deity, but that she should accompany so young a person as Telemachus: After her departure, the old man stood amaz'd, and look'd upon that Heroe as some very extraordinary person, whom in such early years the Goddess of War and Wisdom had vouchsafed to attend. This interpretation agrees perfectly with what Nestor speaks to Telemachus. The hand of young Telemachus, and spoke. Oh happy Youth! and favour'd of the skies, Distinguish'd care of guardian deities! I will take this opportunity to obviate an objection that may be made against all interposition of the Gods in assisting the Heroes of the Odyssey: It has been thought by some Critics a disparagement to them to stand in continual need of such supernatural succour: If two persons were engaged in combat, and a third person should immediately step in to the assistance of one of the parties, and kill the adversary, would it not reflect upon the valour of his friend who was so weak as to want such assistance? Why, for instance, should Jupiter help Æneas to kill Turnus? Was not he brave enough to fight, and strong enough to conquer his enemy by his own prowess? and would not Turnus have kill'd Æneas with the same assistance? It is therefore a disparagement to the actors, thus continually to supply the defects of a Heroe, by the power of a Deity. But this is a false way of arguing, and from hence it might be inferr'd, that the love and favour of a Deity serves only to make those whom he assists, and those who depend upon such assistance, appear weak, impotent, cowardly, and unworthy to be conquerors. Can any doubt arise whether the love and favour of a God be a disparagement or honour to those whom he favours? According to these Critics, we should find the character of a perfect Heroe in an impious Mezentius, who acknowledges no God but his own arm and his own sword: 'Tis true, the objection would be just, if the Heroe himself perform'd nothing of the action; or if when he were almost conquer'd by the superior valour of his enemy, he ow'd his life and victory to Gods and Miracles: But the Heroe always behaves himself in all his actions, as if he were to gain success without the assistance of the Deity; and the presence of the Gods is so order'd, that we may retrench every thing that is miraculous, without making any alteration in the action or character of the human personages. Thus in the instance of Æneas and Turnus, tho' Jupiter favours Æneas, yet Æneas is painted in stronger colours of fortitude, he appears superior, as a man unassisted, and able to conquer Turnus; and consequently the favour of Jupiter makes no alteration in the action or character of Æneas. There is likewise a wide difference between the assistance of a Man, and of a God: The actions of men belong only to the performers of those actions; but when a Deity assists us by inspiring us with strength and courage, the actions we perform are really our own, and the more he favours us, the more glory he gives us: so that the assistance of man eclipses, but the assistance of a God exalts, our glory. Thus, for instance, when Achilles is pursuing Hector, he charges the Greeks to keep off from Hector; their assistance might lessen his glory: but when Pallas offers her assistance, he immediately embraces it as an Honour, and boasts of it as such to Hector. I have been large upon this objection, because the Reader ought to carry it in his memory thro' the whole Poem, and apply it to every action, in which any share is ascribed to any Deity. See Bossu more at large concerning this objection. Whose early years for future worth engage, No vulgar manhood, no ignoble age. For lo! none other of the court above Than she, the daughter of almighty Jove, Pallas her self, the War-triumphant Maid, Confest is thine, as once thy father's aid. So guide me, Goddess! so propitious shine On me, my consort, and my royal line! A yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke. Untam'd, unconscious of the galling yoke. With ample forehead, and yet tender horns Whose budding honours ductile gold adorns. Submissive thus the hoary Sire preferr'd His holy vow: the fav'ring Goddess heard. Then slowly rising, o'er the sandy space Precedes the father, follow'd by his race, (A long procession) timely marching home In comely order to the regal dome. There when arriv'd, on thrones around him plac'd His sons and grand-sons the wide circle grac'd. To these the hospitable Sage, in sign Of social welcome, mix'd the racy wine, (Late from the mellowing cask restor'd to light, By ten long years refin'd, and rosy-bright.) To Pallas high the foaming bowl he crown'd, And sprinkled large Libation on the ground. Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares, And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs. Deep in a rich Alcove the Prince was laid, And slept beneath the pompous Colonnade; Fast by his side Pisistratus lay spread, (In age his equal) on a splendid bed: But in an inner court, securely clos'd, We have here an ancient custom recorded by the Poet; a King places himself before the gate of his Palace upon a seat of marble, worn smooth by long use, says Eustathius, or perhaps smooth'd exquisitely by the hand of the workman. What I would chiefly observe is, that they placed themselves thus in public for the dispatch of justice: We read in the scripture of Judges sitting in the gate; and that this procedure of Nestor was for that purpose is probable from the expression, He sat in the seat where Neleus [??????, or Consiliarius,] used to sit, (which seems to express his wisdom in the discharge of justice.) Nestor is also describ'd as bearing his sceptre in his hand, which was never used but upon some act of regality, in the dispatch of justice, or other solemn occasions. Perhaps, says Dacier, these seats or thrones might be consecrated with oil, to draw a reverence to the seats of Justice as by an act of religion; but I rather judge (adds she) that no more is meant than to express the shining of these thrones, they being undoubtedly made of marble. The rev'rend Nestor with his Queen repos'd, When now Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosie lustre purpled o'er the lawn; The old man early rose, walk'd forth, and sate On polish'd stone before his Palace gate: With unguents smooth the lucid marble shone, Where ancient Neleus sat, a rustic throne; But he descending to th'infernal shade, Sage Nestor fill'd it, and the sceptre sway'd. His sons around him mild obeysance pay, And duteous take the orders of the day. First Echephron and Stratius quit their bed; Then Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymed; The last Pisistratus arose from rest: Would I indulge my fancy in a conjecture, I might suppose that the famous tyrant Pisistratus was descended, or borrow'd his name from this son of Nestor. Herodotus informs us, as Eustathius observes, that all the Pisistrati were originally Pylians. If this be true, we have a very strong evidence that Homer is not all fiction, but that he celebrates the great men of those ages with reality, and only embellishes the true story with the ornaments of Poetry. They came, and near him plac'd the stranger-guest. To these the Senior thus declar'd his will: My sons! the dictates of your sire fulfil. To Pallas first of Gods, prepare the feast, Who grac'd our rites, a more than mortal guest. Let one, dispatchful, bid some swain to lead A well-fed bullock from the grassy mead; One seek the harbour where the vessels moor, And bring thy friends, Telemachus! ashore, (Leave only two the gally to attend) Another to Laerceus must we send, Artist divine, whose skillful hands infold The Author of the Parallel quotes this passage to prove that Homer was ignorant of the Mechanic arts: We have here, says he, a Gilder with his anvil and hammer; but what occasion has he for an anvil and hammer in the art of a Gilder? Boileau has excellently vindicated Homer from this objection, in his reflections upon Longinus; This Gilder was a Gold-beater: Nestor, we see, furnish'd the gold, end he beat it into leaves, so that he had occasion to make use of his anvil and hammer; the anvil was portable, because the work was not laborious. Our modern travellers assure us, that it is at this day the practice in the eastern regions, as in Persia, &amp;c. for the artists in metals to carry about with them the whole implements of trade, to the house of the persons where they find employment; it is therefore a full vindication of Homer, to observe that the gold this artist used in gilding, was nothing but-gold beat into fine leaves. The victim's horn with circumfusile gold. The rest may here the pious duty share, And bid the handmaids for the feast prepare, The seats to range, the fragrant wood to bring, And limpid waters from the living spring. He said, and busy each his care bestow'd; Already at the gates the bullock low'd, Already came the Ithacensian crew, The dextrous smith the tools already drew: His pond'rous hammer, and his anvil sound, And the strong tongs to turn the metal round. Nor was Minerva absent from the rite, It may be ask'd in what sense Minerva can be said to come to the sacrifice? Eustathius answers, that the Ancients finding the inclinations of men to be bent incontinently upon pleasures, to oblige them to use them moderately, distinguish'd times, ordain'd sacrifices, and representing the Gods in the forms of men, brought them to use those pleasures with discretion; they taught them that the Gods came down to their libations and sacrifices, to induce them to govern their conversation with reverence and modesty: Thus Jupiter and the other Gods in the Iliads, and Neptune in the Odyssey, are said to feast with the Æthiopians. If I might be pardon'd a conjecture, I would suppose, that Minerva may in another sense be said to come to the sacrifice; I mean by her image or statue: and what may seem to confirm this opinion, is what Diodorus relates in his third book concerning the above-mention'd Æthiopians; they carry'd about the statues of Jupiter and the other Gods twelve days, during which time the Gods were said to be gone to the Æthiopians: and if the Gods may be said to come to the Æthiopians by their statues: why may not the same be said of Minerva, from the introduction of her statue among the Pylians? So that the appearance of the Goddess may possibly mean the appearance of her statue. She view'd her honours, and enjoy'd the sight. With rev'rent hand the King presents the gold, Which round th'intorted horns the gilder roll'd; So wrought, as Pallas might with pride behold. Young Aretus from forth his bridal bow'r Brought the full laver, o'er their hands to pour, And canisters of consecrated flour. Stratius and Ethephron the victim led; Nestor here makes use only of the ministry of his sons; the reason of it is, because it was reckon'd honourable to serve in the performance of sacrifice, this being in some sense an attending upon the Gods: or because it was the practice of those ages for great persons to do those offices with their own hands, which in the latter have been perform'd by servants. Eustathius reports a saying of Antigonus, who observing his son behaving himself imperiously to his subjects, “Know'st thou not, “says he, that Royalty itself is but illustrious servitude!” an intimation that he himself was but a servant of the public, and therefore should use his servants with moderation. But the true reason of Nestor's assisting in the sacrifice is, because Kings anciently had the inspection of religion, and Priesthood was join'd to Royalty, according to that of Virgil, Rex Anins, rex idem hominum Phœbique sacerdos. The axe was held by warlike Thrasymed, In act to strike: Before him Perseus stood, The vase extending to receive the blood. The King himself initiates to the Pow'r; Scatters with quiv'ring hand the sacred flour, And the stream sprinkles: From the curling brows The hair collected in the fire he throws. Soon as due vows on ev'ry part were pay'd, And sacred wheat upon the victim lay'd, Strong Thrasymed discharg'd the speeding blow Full on his neck, and cut the nerves in two. Down sunk the heavy beast: the females round Maids, wives, and matrons, mix a shrilling sound. I have kept the meaning of the word in the original, which signifies prayers made with loud cries, ????????. ???????, says Hesychius, is, ???? ???????? ?? ????????? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????, the voice of women, which they make at sacrifices in their prayers. But there is still something in it more to the present purpose; the Scholiast upon Æschylus remarks, that this word is not used properly but when apply'd to the prayers offer'd to Minerva; for Minerva is the only Goddess to whom prayers are made with loud cries, she being the Goddess of War; to other Deities they offer prayer with thanksgiving; ??? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??????? ???? ???????? ??????????, ???? ?? ?????? ????? ???????????. Thus also in the sixth book of the Iliads, verse 301. ?? ?? ??????? ????? ????? ?????? ???????. They fill the dome with supplicating cries. And in the present passage in the Odyssey, ? ?? ?? ???????? ????????? ??, ???? ??, &amp;c. Dacier. Nor scorn'd the Queen the holy choir to join, (The first-born she, of old Clymenus' line; In youth by Nestor lov'd, of spotless fame, And lov'd in age, Eurydice her name) From earth they rear him, struggling now with death; And Nestor's Youngest stops the vents of breath. The soul for ever flies: on all sides round Streams the black blood, and smokes upon the ground. The beast they then divide, and dis-unite The ribs and limbs, observant of the rite: On these, in double cawls involv'd with art, The choicest morsels lay from ev'ry part. The sacred Sage before his altar stands, Turns the burnt-off'ring with his holy hands, And pours the wine, and bids the flames aspire: The youth with instruments surround the fire. The thighs now sacrific'd, and entrails drest, Th'assistants part, transfix, and broil the rest. While these officious tend the rites divine, The last fair branch of the Nestorean line Sweet Polycaste, took the pleasing toil It is very necessary to say something about this practice of women bathing and anointing men; it frequently occurs thro' the whole Odyssey, and is so contrary to the usage of the moderns, as to give offence to modesty; neither is this done by women of inferior quality, but we have here a young Princess, bathing, anointing, and cloathing the naked Telemachus. Eustathius indeed tells us, it was undoubtedly by her father's command: but if it was a piece of immodesty, it does not solve the objection, whoever commanded it. I confess it would be immodest in these ages of the world, and the only excuse that occurs to me is, to say that Custom establish'd it. It is in manners, in some degree, as in dress; if a fashion never so indecent prevails, yet no person is ridiculous, because it is fashionable: so in manners, if a practice prevails universally, tho' not reconcilable to real modesty, yet no person can be said to be immodest who comes into it, because it is agreeable to the custom of the times and countries. To bathe the Prince, and pour the fragrant oil. O'er his fair limbs a flow'ry vest he threw, And issu'd, like a God, to mortal view. His former seat beside the King he found, (His people's Father with his peers around) All plac'd at ease the holy banquet join, And in the dazling goblet laughs the wine. The rage of thirst and hunger now supprest, The Monarch turns him to his royal guest; And for the promis'd journey bids prepare The smooth-hair'd horses, and the rapid car, Observant of his word. The word scarce spoke, The sons obey, and join them to the yoke. Then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings, And presents, such as suit the state of Kings. The glitt'ring seat Telemachus ascends; I shall lay together what I have further to observe on the conclusion of this book: It is remarkable, that the Poet does not amuse himself in describing the present he receiv'd from Nestor, or the provisions for the journey, or even the journey it self at large; he dispatches the whole in a few lines very judiciously; he carries his Heroe directly to Menelaus, who is to furnish many incidents that contribute to the design of the Poem, and passes over other matters as unnecessary. We have here likewise a piece of poetical Geography, and learn that it is exactly two days journey from Pyle to Lacedæmon. This book takes up three days; the first is spent in the enquiries Telemachus makes of Nestor concerning Ulysses; the two last in the morning sacrifice at Pylos, and in the journey of Telemachus to Lacedæmon; so that five days have now pass'd since the opening of the Poem. I have said nothing about the sacrifice, tho' it be the most exact description of the sacrifices as practis'd by the Ancients, perhaps extant in any Author; I refer to the observations upon the first book of the Iliad. I would here remark that the three first books are written with the utmost simplicity, there has been no room for such exalted strokes of Poetry as are to be found in the Iliad, or in the future parts of the Odyssey: But this is not owing to the decay of genius in Homer, as some Critics have affirm'd, (who look upon the Odyssey as bearing marks of his declining years,) but to the nature of the subject. The characters of Achilles and Ulysses are both very great, but very different. The Iliad consists of battles, and a continual commotion; the Odyssey in Patience and Wisdom: and consequently the style of the two Poems must be as different as the characters of the two Heroes. A noble fountain of Poetry opens in the next book, and flows with an uninterrupted course almost thro' the whole Odyssey. His faithful guide Pisistratus attends: With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew: He lash'd the coursers, and the coursers flew. Beneath the bounding yoke alike they held Their equal pace, and smoak'd along the field. The tow'rs of Pylos sink, its views decay, Fields after fields fly back, till close of day: Then sunk the Sun, and darken'd all the way. To Pheræ now, Diocleus' stately seat, (Of Alpheus' race) the weary youths retreat. His house affords the hospitable rite, And pleas'd they sleep (the blessing of the night.) But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosy lustre purpled o'er the lawn; Again they mount, their journey to renew, And from the sounding portico they flew. Along the waving fields their way they hold, The fields receding as the chariot roll'd: Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light, And o'er the shaded landscape rush'd the night. THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Conference with Menelaus. Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably receiv'd by Menelaus, to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befel the Greeks since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the Prophecies of Proteus to him in his return, from which he acquaints Telemachus, that Ulysses is detain'd in the Island of Calypso. In the mean-time the Suitors consult to destroy Telemachus in his voyage home. Penelope is appriz'd of this, but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Ipthima. Aristotle in his Poetics reports, that certain ancient Critics reproached Homer for an indecency in making Telemachus take his abode with Menelaus, and not with his own grandfather Icarius: this Monsieur Dacier sufficiently answers, by shewing that Icarius had settled himself in Acarnaia, and not in Lacedæmon. And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta, whose walls a range of hills surrounds: At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sat Atrides 'midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen's pow'r, Athenæns has been very severe upon this passage, as Eustathius observes, and Dacier from Eustathius. Aristarchus, says Athenæus, misguides us, the words ??? ?? ????? ????????, led him into an error; whereas the marriage is compleated, the wedded couple gone away from Menelaus, and he and Helen are alone at Lacedæmon. The five verses, continues he, (the fifteenth to the twentieth inclusively) are taken from the eighteenth book of the Iliads, and inserted very improperly in this place by Aristarchus. Athenæus gives several reasons for his opinion, as that music and dancing were very contrary to the severe manners of the Lacedæmonians; besides the dance was a Cretan dance, how then could it be practis'd among the Spartans? The Poet mentions neither the name of the Bard, nor one word of the subject of the songs: neither can the words ?????? ??????????, be apply'd at all to the Dancers, but to the Musicians; and lastly, it is not to be imagin'd that Telemachus and Pisisiratus should be so unpolite, as not to be at all affected with the music, had there been any, and yet break out into such wonder at the sight of the beauty of the Palace of Menelaus. Aristarchus, adds he, thought the description of the wedding of the son and daughter of a King was too meanly and concisely describ'd, and therefore made this addition. But it is easy to refute Athenæus, and vindicate Aristarchus. Athenæus understood ????? and ????? in the wrong sense, they are of the imperfect, he was sending, or about to send, and not had sent, &amp;c. If the marriage had been absolutely finish'd, why should Minerva absent her self from Menelaus, when the celebration of the nuptials is the only reason of the absence of that Goddess? and as for music and dancing being contrary to the severe manners of the Lacedæmonians, this is all conjecture: Menelaus lived more than three hundred years before Lycurgus; and because such diversions were forbid in Sparta in the days of Lycurgus, must it follow that they were not used in those of Menelaus? And should it be granted that music and dancing were not used in his times, might he not relax a little from the severity of his times, upon such an occasion of joy as the marriage of a son and daughter? I am sure these diversions are not more contrary to the severity of the Spartans, than the magnificence of the Palace of Menelaus was to their simplicity. “But he does not name the Bard, or the subject of his songs:” But is this a reason why the verses are spurious? we should rather admire the judgment of the Poet, who having so fair an opportunity to describe these nuptials, yet rejects the temptation, dismisses the whole in a few lines, and follows where his subject leads him. The objection about the dance being Cretan is not more valid: Menelaus (as we may learn from the preceding book) had been in Crete, and might bring it thence to Lacedæmon. And as for the Critism upon ?????????? it is but a fallacy; Casaubon has shewn beyond contradiction, that ???????? is apply'd indifferently to all those who give example to others; and consequently may be apply'd to Dancers as well as Musicians. It may be further added, that although it should be allow'd that the word ???????? is only properly apply'd to music, yet in this place the word would not be improperly apply'd to dancers; for the dancers, without usurping upon the province of the singer, might ?????? ????????, or chuse those songs, to which they desired to dance; as is the usage at this day. Diodorus is of opinion, that the whole twelve lines after the second to the fifteenth are not genuine; but what has been said of Athenæus, may be apply'd to Diodorus. To bless his sons and daughters nuptial hour. That day, to great Achilles' son resign'd Hermione, (the fairest of her kind) Was sent to crown the long-protracted joy, Espous'd before the final doom of Troy: With steeds, and gilded cars, a gorgeous train Attend the nymph to Phthia's distant reign. Mean-while at home, to Megapenthes' bed The virgin-choir Alector's daughter led. Brave Megapenthes, from a stol'n amour To great Atrides' age his hand-maid bore: To Helen's bed the Gods alone assign Hermione, t' extend the regal line; On whom a radiant pomp of Graces wait, Resembling Venus in attractive state. While this gay friendly troop the King surround, With festival and mirth the roofs resound: A Bard amid the joyous circle sings High airs, attemper'd to the vocal strings; Whilst warbling to the varied strain, advance Two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance. 'Twas then, that issuing thro' the palace gate The splendid car roll'd slow in regal state: On the bright eminence young Nestor shone, And fast beside him great Ulysses' son: Grave Eteoneus saw the pomp appear, And speeding, thus address'd the royal ear. Two youths approach, whose semblant features prove Their blood devolving from the source of Jove. Is due reception deign'd, or must they bend Their doubtful course to seek a distant friend? Insensate! with a sigh the King replies, This is the first appearance of Menelaus; and surely nothing can more reconcile him to the favour of the spectators, than those amiable colours in which the Poet paints him. There is an overflow of humanity and gratitude in his expressions, like that of Dido in Virgil, Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco. They contain a fine piece of morality, and teach that those men are more tender-hearted and humane who have felt the reverse of fortune, than those who have only liv'd in a condition of prosperity. Too long, mis-judging, have I thought thee wise: But sure relentless folly steels thy breast, Obdurate to reject the stranger-guest; To those dear hospitable rites a foe, Which in my wand'rings oft reliev'd my woe: Fed by the bounty of another's board, 'Till pitying Jove my native realm restor'd— Strait be the coursers from the car releast, Conduct the youths to grace the genial feast. The Seneshal rebuk'd in haste withdrew; With equal haste a menial train pursue: Part led the coursers, from the car enlarg'd, Each to a crib with choicest grain surcharg'd; Part in a portico, profusely grac'd With rich magnificence, the chariot plac'd: Then to the dome the friendly pair invite, Who eye the dazling roofs with vast delight; Resplendent as the blaze of summer-noon, Or the pale radiance of the midnight moon. From room to room their eager view they bend; Thence to the bath, a beauteous pile, descend; Where a bright damsel-train attend the guests With liquid odours, and embroider'd vests. Refresh'd, they wait them to the bow'r of state, Where circled with his Peers Atrides sate: Thron'd next the King, a fair attendant brings The purest product of the chrystal springs; High on a massy vase of silver mold, The burnish'd laver flames with solid gold; In solid gold the purple vintage flows, And on the board a second banquet rose. When thus the King with hospitable port:— Accept this welcome to the Spartan court; The waste of nature let the feast repair, Then your high lineage and your names declare: Say from what scepter'd ancestry ye claim, Recorded eminent in deathless fame? For vulgar parents cannot stamp their race With signatures of such majestic grace. Ceasing, benevolent he strait assigns The royal portion of the choicest chines To each accepted friend: with grateful haste They share the honours of the rich repast. Suffic'd, soft-whispering thus to Nestor's son, This may be thought a circumstance of no importance, and very trivial in Telemachus; but it shews his address and decency: He whispers, to avoid the appearance of a flatterer, or to conceal his own inexperience, in shewing too much surprize at the magnificence of the Palace of Menelaus. Eustathius. His head reclin'd, young Ithacus begun. View'st thou un-mov'd, O ever-honour'd most! These prodigies of art, and wond'rous cost? Above, beneath, around the Palace shines The sumless treasure of exhausted mines: The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay, And studded amber darts a golden ray: Such, and not nobler, in the realms above My wonder dictates is the dome of Jove. The Monarch took the word, and grave reply'd. The ancients, says Eustathius, observe the prudence of Menelaus in his reply to Telemachus; and the prudence of Telemachus in his behaviour to Menelaus: Menelaus denies not his riches and magnificence, but to take off the envy which they might attract, he throws the calamities he has undergone into the contrary scale, and balances his felicity with his misfortunes: And Telemachus coming into the Palace at the time of an entertainment, chuses to satisfy his curiosity rather than his appetite. Plutarch, I confess, condemns Telemachus of inexperience; who when he saw the Palace of Nestor furnish'd only with things useful to life, as beds, tables, &amp;c. is seiz'd with no admiration; but the superfluities of Menelaus, his ivory, amber and gold, &amp;c. carry him into transports: whereas a Socrates or a Diogenes would have exclaim'd. What heaps of vanities have I beheld! 'Tis true, such a judgment might become Philosophers; but who, as Dacier observes, can think the character of a Socrates or a Diogenes suitable to young Telemachus? What is decent in a Prince, and a young man, would ill become the gravity and wisdom of a Philosopher. Presumptuous are the vaunts, and vain the pride Of man, who dares in pomp with Jove contest, Unchang'd, immortal, and supremely blest! With all my affluence when my woes are weigh'd, Envy will own, the purchase dearly paid. For eight slow-circling years by tempest tost, From Cyprus to the far Phœnician coast, (Sidon the Capital) I stretch'd my toil Thro' regions fatten'd with the flows of Nile. The words are in the original ?????????? ?????????, others read them ?????????? ??? ???????, from their veracity in oracles, for which they were very famous; and indeed the word ????????? is not necessary, it being used in the very same sentence, tho' it must be confess'd such repetitions are frequent in Homer. There is also a different reading of the word ????????; some have it ????????, or Blacks; others, ????????? ?????? ??; but the common reading is thought the best. The Erembri are the Arabian Troglodytes. Strabo informs us, that in former ages the bounds of the Æthiopians lay near to Thebes in Ægypt, so that Menelaus travelling to Thebes, might with ease visit the Æthiopians. Others have without any foundation imagin'd that he pass'd the streights of Gibraltar, and sail'd to the Indies. Sidon is the capital of the Phœnicians. Eustathius. Next, Æthiopia's utmost bound explore, And the parcht borders of th'Arabian shore: Then warp my voyage on the southern gales, O'er the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails: That happy clime! where each revolving year These sheep, as describ'd by Homer, may be thought the creation of the Poet, and not the production of nature: But Herodotus, says Eustathius, writes, that in Scythia the oxen have no horns thro' the extremity of the cold: He quotes this very verse, rightly intimating, adds Herodotus, that in hot regions the horns of cattle shoot very speedily. Aristotle directly asserts, that in Lybia the young ones of horned cattle have horns immediately after they are brought into the world. So that Aristotle and Herodotus vindicate Homer. The Poet adds, that the sheep breed three times in the year; these words may have a different interpretation, and imply that they breed in three seasons of the year, and not only in the spring, as in other countries; or that the sheep have at once three lambs; but the first is the better interpretation. Athenæus upon this passage writes, that there are things in other countries no less strange than what Homer relates of these sheep of Libya. Thus in Lusitania, a country of Spain, now Portugal, there is a wonderful fruitfulness in all cattle, by reason of the excellent temper of the air; the fruits there never rot, and the roses, violets and asparagus, never fail above three months in the year. Eust. The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear; And two fair crescents of translucent horn The brows of all their young increase adorn: The shepherd swains with sure abundance blest, On the fat flock and rural dainties feast; Nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail, But every season fills the foaming pail. Whilst heaping unwish'd wealth, I distant roam; The best of brothers, at his natal home, Menelaus neither mentions Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, nor Ægysthus by name: a just indignation and resentment is the occasion of his suppressing the names of Clytemnestra and Ægysthus. Thro' the whole Iliad Menelaus is describ'd as a very affectionate brother, and the love he bears Agamemnon is the reason why he passes by his name in silence. We see that he dispatches the whole in one verse and a half; Nestor had told the story pretty largely in the preceding book, and as he was a person less nearly concern'd, might speak of it with more ease and better temper than Menelaus; the Poet avoids a needless repetition, and a repetition too of a story universally known to all the Greeks. The death of Agamemnon is distributed into four places in the Odyssey; Nestor, Menelaus, Proteus, and the shade of Agamemnon in the 11?? book, all relate it, and every one very properly. Proteus as a prophet more fully than Nestor or Menelaus, and Agamemnon more fully than them all, as being best acquainted with it. Eustathius. By the dire fury of a traitress wife, Ends the sad evening of a stormy life: Whence with incessant grief my soul annoy'd, These riches are possess'd, but not enjoy'd! My wars, the copious theme of ev'ry tongue, In the original Menelaus says, I have destroy'd a house, &amp;c. There is an ambiguity in the expression, as Eustathius observes: for it may either signify the house of Priam, or his own in Argos; if it be understood of his own, then the meaning is, “I have indeed great wealth, but have purchas'd it with the loss of my people; I could be content with the third part of it, if I could restore those to life who have perish'd before Troy.” If it be understood of the kingdom of Priam, the regret he shews will still appear the greater. He is enumerating his domestic happiness, and his foreign conquest of Troy; but he throws the destruction of so many brave men who fell before it, in the contrary scale; and it so far outweighs both his wealth and his glory, that they both are joyless to him. Either of these interpretations shew an excellent temper of humanity in Menelaus, who thinks the effusion of blood too dear a price for glory. At the same time the Poet gives an admirable picture of human nature, which is restless in the pursuit of what it miscalls happiness, and when in possession of it, neglects it. But the disquiet of Menelaus arises not from inconstancy of temper, but wisdom; it shews that all happiness is unsatisfactory. To you, your fathers have recorded long: How fav'ring heav'n repaid my glorious toils With a sack'd Palace, and barbaric spoils. Oh! had the Gods so large a boon deny'd, And Life, the just equivalent, supply'd To those brave warriors, who, with glory fir'd, Far from their country in my cause expir'd! Still in short intervals of pleasing woe, Regardful of the friendly dues I owe, I to the glorious dead, for ever dear! Indulge the tribute of a grateful tear. But oh! Ulysses—deeper than the rest It is with admirable address that the Poet falls into his subject; it is art, but yet it seems to be nature: This conduct has a double effect, it takes away all suspicion of flattery, for Menelaus is ignorant that the person with whom he discourses is Telemachus, this gives him a manifest evidence of the love he bears to Ulysses; the young man could not but be pleased with the praise of his father, and with the sincerity of it. It is also observable, that Menelaus builds his friendship for Ulysses upon a noble foundation; I mean the sufferings which Ulysses underwent for his friend: Menelaus ascribes not their affection to any familiarity or intercourse of entertainments, but to a more sincere cause, to the hazards which brave men undertake for a friend. In short, the friendship of Menelaus and Ulysses is the friendship of Heroes. Eustathius. That sad idea wounds my anxious breast! My heart bleeds fresh with agonizing pain; The bowl, and tasteful viands tempt in vain, Nor sleep's soft pow'r can close my streaming eyes, When imag'd to my soul his sorrows rise. No peril in my cause he ceas'd to prove, His labours equall'd only by my love: And both alike to bitter fortune born, For him, to suffer, and for me to mourn! Whether he wanders on some friendless coast, Or glides in Stygian gloom a pensive ghost, No fame reveals; but doubtful of his doom, His good old Sire with sorrow to the tomb Declines his trembling steps; untimely care Withers the blooming vigour of his heir; And the chaste partner of his bed and throne, Wastes all her widow'd hours in tender moan. While thus pathetic to the Prince he spoke, From the brave youth the streaming passion broke: Studious to veil the grief, in vain represt, His face he shrowded with his purple vest: The conscious Monarch pierc'd the coy disguise, And view'd his filial love with vast surprize; Dubious to press the tender theme, or wait To hear the youth enquire his father's fate. In this suspense bright Helen grac'd the room; Menelaus conjectur'd that the person he had entertain'd was the son of Ulysses, from the tears he shed at the name of his father, and from the resemblance there was between Ulysses and Telemachus; it might therefore have been expected that Menelaus should immediately have acknowledg'd Telemachus, and not delay'd a full discovery one moment, out of regard to his absent friend; but Menelaus defers it upon a twofold account, to give some time to Telemachus to indulge his sorrow for his father, and recover himself from it, and also to avoid the repetition of a discovery upon the appearance of Helen, who would be curious to know the condition of the strangers. It may be necessary to say something concerning Helen, that fatal beauty that engag'd Greece and Asia in arms; she is drawn in the same colours in the Odyssey as in the Iliad; it is a vicious character, but the colours are so admirably soften'd by the art of the Poet, that we pardon her infidelity. Menelaus is an uncommon instance of conjugal affection, he forgives a wife who had been false to him, and receives her into a full degree of favour. But perhaps the Reader might have been shock'd at it, and prejudiced against Helen as a person that ought to be forgot, or have her name only mention'd to disgrace it: The Poet therefore, to reconcile her to his Reader, brings her in as a penitent, condemning her own infidelity in very strong expressions; she shews true modesty, when she calls herself impudent, and by this conduct we are inclined, like Menelaus, to forgive her. Before her breath'd a gale of rich perfume. So moves, adorn'd with each attractive grace, The silver-shafted Goddess of the Chace! The seat of majesty Adraste brings, It has been observ'd, that Helen has not the same attendants in the Odyssey as she had in the Iliad; they perhaps might be Trojans; and consequently be left in their own country; or rather, it was an act of prudence in Menelaus, not to suffer those servants about her who had been her attendants and confidents in her infidelity. Eust. With art illustrious, for the pomp of Kings. To spread the pall beneath the regal chair Of softest woof, is bright Alcippe's care. A silver canister divinely wrought, In her soft hands the beauteous Phylo brought: To Sparta's Queen of old the radiant vase Alcandra gave, a pledge of royal grace: For Polybus her Lord, (whose sov'reign sway The wealthy tribes of Pharian Thebes obey) When to that court Atrides came, carest With vast munificence th'imperial guest: Two lavers from the richest ore refin'd, With silver tripods, the kind host assign'd; And bounteous, from the royal treasure told Ten equal talents of refulgent gold. Alcandra, consort of his high command, A golden distaff gave to Helen's hand; And that rich vase, with living sculpture wrought, Which heap'd with wool the beauteous Phylo brought: The silken fleece impurpl'd for the loom, Rival'd the hyacinth in vernal bloom. The sov'reign seat then Jove-born Helen press'd, And pleasing thus her sceptred Lord address'd. Who grace our palace now, that friendly pair, Speak they their lineage, or their names declare? Uncertain of the truth, yet uncontroul'd Hear me the bodings of my breast unfold. With wonder rapt, on yonder cheek I trace The feature of the Ulyssean race: Diffus'd o'er each resembling line appear, In just similitude, the grace and air It may seem strange that Helen should at first view recollect the features of Ulysses in Telemachus; and that Menelaus, who was better acquainted with him, and his constant friend, should not make the same observation. But Athenæus, to reconcile this to probability, says, that women are curious and skilful observers of the likeness of children to parents, for one particular reason, that they may, upon finding any dissimilitude, have the pleasure of hinting at the unchastity of others. Of young Telemachus! the lovely boy, Who bless'd Ulysses with a father's joy, What time the Greeks combin'd their social arms, T' avenge the stain of my ill-fated charms! Just is thy thought, the King assenting cries, Methinks Ulysses strikes my wond'ring eyes: Full shines the father in the filial frame, His port, his features, and his shape the same: Such quick regards his sparkling eyes bestow; Such wavy ringlets o'er his shoulders flow! And when he heard the long disastrous store Of cares, which in my cause Ulysses bore; Dismay'd, heart-wounded with paternal woes, Above restraint the tide of sorrow rose: Cautious to let the gushing grief appear, His purple garment veil'd the falling tear. See there confest, Pisistratus replies, The genuine worth of Ithacus the wise! Of that heroic sire the youth is sprung, But modest awe hath chain'd his tim'rous tongue. Thy voice, O King! with pleas'd attention heard, Is like the dictates of a God rever'd. With him at Nestor's high command I came, Whose age I honour with a parent's name. By adverse destiny constrain'd to sue For counsel and redress, he sues to you. Whatever ill the friendless orphan bears, Bereav'd of parents in his infant years, Still must the wrong'd Telemachus sustain, If hopeful of your aid, he hopes in vain: Affianc'd in your friendly pow'r alone, The youth wou'd vindicate the vacant throne. Is Sparta blest, and these desiring eyes View my friends son? (the King exulting cries) Son of my friend, by glorious toils approv'd, Whose sword was sacred to the man he lov'd: Mirror of constant faith, rever'd, and mourn'd!— When Troy was ruin'd, had the chief return'd, No Greek an equal space had e'er possest Of dear affection, in my grateful breast. I, to confirm the mutual joys we shar'd, For his abode a Capital prepar'd; The Poet puts these words in the mouth of Menelaus, to express the sincerity of his friendship to Ulysses; he intended him all advantage, and no detriment: we must therefore conclude, that Ulysses was still to retain his sovereignty over Ithaca, and only remove to Argos, to live with so sincere a friend as Menelaus. Eustathius. Argos the seat of sovereign rule I chose; Fair in the plan the future palace rose, Where my Ulysses and his race might reign, And portion to his tribes the wide domain. To them my vassals had resign'd a soil, With teeming plenty to reward their toil. There with commutual zeal we both had strove In acts of dear benevolence, and love: Brothers in peace, not rivals in command, And death alone dissolv'd the friendly band! Some envious pow'r the blissful scene destroys; Vanish'd are all the visionary joys: The soul of friendship to my hope is lost, Fated to wander from his natal coast! He ceas'd; a gust of grief began to rise: It has been observ'd through the Iliad, and may be observ'd through the whole Odyssey, that it was not a disgrace to the greatest Heroes to shed tears; and indeed I cannot see why it should be an honour to any man, to be able to divest himself of human nature so far as to appear insensible upon the most affecting occasions. No man is born a Stoic; it is art, not nature; tears are only a shame, when the cause from whence they flow is mean or vicious. Here Menelaus laments a friend, Telemachus a father, Pisistratus a brother: but from what cause arise the tears of Helen? It is to be remember'd that Helen is drawn in the softest colours in the Odyssey; the character of the adultress is lost in that of the penitent; the name of Ulysses throws her into tears, because she is the occasion of all the sufferings of that brave man; the Poet makes her the first in sorrow, as she is the cause of all their tears. Fast streams a tide from beauteous Helen's eyes; Fast for the Sire the filial sorrows flow; The weeping Monarch swells the mighty woe: Thy cheek, Pisistratus, the tears bedew, While pictur'd to thy mind appear'd in view Thy martial Antilochus. Brother: on the Phrygian plain Extended pale, by swarthy Memnon slain! But silence soon the son of Nestor broke, And melting with fraternal pity spoke. Frequent, O King, was Nestor wont to raise And charm attention, with thy copious praise: To crown thy various gifts, the sage assign'd The glory of a firm capacious mind: With that superior attribute controul This unavailing impotence of soul. Let not your roof with echoing grief resound, It may be ask'd why sorrow for the dead should be more unseasonable in the evening than the morning? Eustathius answers, lest others should look upon our evening tears as the effect of wine, and not of love to the dead. Intempestiores venit inter pocula fletus. Nec lacrymas dulci fas est miscere falerno. I fancy there may be a more rational account given of this expression; The time of feasting was ever look'd upon as a time of joy and thanksgiving to the Gods; it bore a religious veneration among the Ancients, and consequently to shed tears when they should express their gratitude to the Gods with joy, was esteem'd a prophanation. Now for the feast the friendly bowl is crown'd: But when from dewy shade emerging bright, Aurora streaks the sky with orient light, Let each deplore his dead: the rites of woe Are all, alas! the living can bestow: O'er the congenial dust injoin'd to shear The graceful curl, and drop the tender tear. Then mingling in the mournful pomp with you, I'll pay my brother's ghost a warrior's due, And mourn the brave Antilochus, a name Not unrecorded in the rolls of fame: With strength and speed superior form'd, in fight To face the foe, or intercept his flight: Too early snatch'd by fate ere known to me! I boast a witness of his worth in thee. Young and mature! the Monarch thus rejoins, In thee renew'd the soul of Nestor shines: Form'd by the care of that consummate sage, In early bloom an Oracle of age. When-e'er his influence Jove vouchsafes to show'r To bless the natal, and the nuptial hour; From the great sire transmissive to the race, The boon devolving gives distinguish'd grace. Such, happy Nestor! was thy glorious doom; Around thee full of years, thy offspring bloom, Expert of arms, and prudent in debate; The gifts of heav'n to guard thy hoary state. But now let each becalm his troubled breast, Wash, and partake serene the friendly feast. To move thy suit, Telemachus, delay, 'Till heav'n's revolving lamp restores the day. He said, Asphalion swift the laver brings; Alternate all partake the grateful springs: Then from the rites of purity repair, And with keen gust the sav'ry viands share. Mean-time with genial joy to warm the soul, Bright Helen mix'd a mirth-inspiring bowl: The conjectures about this cordial of Helen have been almost infinite. Some take Nepenthes allegorically, to signify History, Music, or Philosophy. Plutarch in the first of the Symposiacs affirms it to be, discourse well suiting the present passions and conditions of the hearers. Macrobius is of the same opinion, Delinimentum illud quod Helena vino miscuit, non herba fuit, non ex Indiâ succus, sed narrandi opportunitas, quæ hospitem mœroris oblitum flexit ad gaudium. What gave a foundation to this fiction of Homer, as Dacier observes, might be this. Diodorus writes that in Ægypt, and chiefly at Heliopolis, the same with Thebes where Menelaus sojourn'd, as has been already observ'd, there liv'd women who boasted of certain potions, which not only made the unfortunate forget all their calamities, but drove away the most violent sallies of grief or anger. Eusebius directly affirms, that even in his time the women of Diospolis were able to calm the rage of grief or anger by certain potions. Now whether this be truth or fiction, it fully vindicates Homer, since a Poet may make use of a prevailing, tho' false, opinion. Milton mentions this Nepenthes in his excellent Masque of Comus. —Behold this cordial Julep here, That flames and dances in his chrystal bounds! Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone In Ægypt gave to Jove-born Helena, Is of such pow'r as this to stir up joy, To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst. But that there may be something more than fiction in this is very probable, since the Ægyptians were so notoriously skill'd in physick; and particularly since this very Thon, or Thonis, or Thoon, is reported by the ancients to have been the inventor of physic among the Ægyptians. The description of this Nepenthes agrees admirably with what we know of the qualities and effects of Opium. It is further said of Thon, that he was King of Canopus, and entertain'd Menelaus hospitably before he had seen Helen; but afterwards falling in love with her, and offering violence, he was slain by Menelaus. From his name the Ægyptians gave the name of Thoth to the first month of their year, and also to a city the name of Thonis. Ælian writes, that Menelaus, when he travell'd to the Æthiopians, committed Helen to the protection of Thonis; that she fell in love with him, that Polydamna growing jealous confin'd her to the Island Pharos, but gave her an herb to preserve her from the poison of serpents there frequent, which from Helen was call'd Helenium. Strabo writes, that at Canopus on the mouth of Nile there stands a city named Thonies, from King Thonis, who receiv'd Helen and Menelaus. Herodotus relates, that Thonis was Governour of Canopus, that he represented the injury which Paris had done to Menelaus, to Proteus who reign'd in Memphis. Eustathius. This last remark from Herodotus is sufficient to shew, that Homer is not so fictitious as is generally imagined, that there really was a King named Proteus, that the Poet builds his fables upon truth, and that it was truth that originally determin'd Homer to introduce Proteus into his Poetry; but I intend to explain this more largely in the story of Proteus. Temper'd with drugs of sov'reign use, t'assuage The boiling bosom of tumultuous Rage; To clear the cloudy front of wrinkled Care, And dry the tearful sluices of Despair: Charm'd with that virtuous draught, th'exalted mind All sense of woe delivers to the wind. Tho' on the blazing pile his parent lay, Or a lov'd brother groan'd his life away, Or darling son oppress'd by ruffian-force Fell breathless at his feet, a mangled corse, From morn to eve, impassive and serene, The man entranc'd wou'd view the deathful scene. These drugs, so friendly to the joys of life, Bright Helen learn'd from Thone's imperial wife; Who sway'd the sceptre, where prolific Nile With various simples cloaths the fat'ned soil. With wholseme herbage mix'd, the direful bane Of vegetable venom, taints the plain; From Pæon sprung, their patron-god imparts To all the Pharian race his healing arts. The beverage now prepar'd t'inspire the feast, The circle thus the beauteous Queen addrest. Thron'd in omnipotence, supremest Jove Tempers the fates of human race above; By the firm sanction of his sov'reign will, Alternate are decreed our good and ill. To feastful mirth be this white hour assign'd, And sweet discourse, the banquet of the mind. My self assisting in the social joy, What is here related shews the necessity of the introduction of Helen, and the use the Poet makes of it: she is not brought in merely as a muta persona, to fill up the number of persons; but she relates several incidents, in which she her self was concern'd, and which she could only know; and consequently not only diversifies, but carries on the design of the story. Eustathius. Will tell Ulysses' bold exploit in Troy: Sole witness of the deed I now declare; Speak you, (who saw) his wonders in the war. Seam'd o'er with wounds, which his own sabre gave, The Poet here shews his judgment in passing over many instances of the sufferings of Ulysses, and relating this piece of conduct, not mention'd by any other Author. The art of Ulysses in extricating himself from difficulties is laid down as the groundwork of the Poem, he is ??????????, and this is an excellent example of it. This further shews the necessity of the appearance of Helen, no other person being acquainted with the story. If this stratagem be not a reality, yet it bears the resemblance of it; and Megabysus the Persian (as Eustathius observes) practis'd it, as we learn from history. We may reasonably conjecture that Ulysses was committed to Helen, in hopes that he would discover the affairs of the army more freely to her than any other person: for what could be more agreeable to a Greek, than to be committed to the care of a Greek, as Ulysses was to Helen? By the same conduct the Poet raises the character of Helen, by making her shew her repentance by an act of generosity to her countryman. The original says she gave an oath to Ulysses not to discover him before he was in safety in the Grecian army: Now this does not imply that she ever discover'd to the Trojans that Ulysses had enter'd Troy: the contrary opinion is most probable; for it cannot be imagin'd but all Troy must have been incens'd greatly against her, had they known that she had conceal'd one of their mortal enemies, and dismiss'd him in safety: It was sufficient for Ulysses to take her oath that she would not discover him, 'till he was in security: he left her future conduct to her own discretion. It is probable that she furnish'd Ulysses with a sword, for in his return he slew many Trojans: He came to Troy, observes Eustathius, in rags, and like a slave; and to have conceal'd a sword, would have endanger'd his life upon a discovery of it, and given strong suspicions of an impostor. In the vile habit of a village slave, The foe deceiv'd, he pass'd the tented plain, In Troy to mingle with the hostile train. In this attire secure from searching eyes, 'Till haply piercing thro' the dark disguise The chief I challeng'd; he, whose practis'd wit Knew all the serpent-mazes of deceit, Eludes my search: but when his form I view'd Fresh from the bath with fragrant oils renew'd, His limbs in military purple dress'd; Each brightning grace the genuine Greek confess'd. A previous pledge of sacred faith obtain'd, 'Till he the lines and Argive fleet regain'd To keep his stay conceal'd; the chief declar'd The plans of war against the town prepar'd. Exploring then the secrets of the state, The word ?????? is here used in a large sense: it takes in all the observations Ulysses made during his continuance in Troy, it takes in the designs and counsels of the enemy, his measuring the gates, the height of the walls, the easiest plan for an assault or ambush, the taking away the Palladium, or whatever else a wise man may be suppos'd to observe, or act, in execution of such a stratagem. Eustathius. He learn'd what best might urge the Dardan fate: And safe returning to the Grecian host, Sent many a shade to Pluto's dreary coast. Loud grief resounded thro' the tow'rs of Troy, But my pleas'd bosom glow'd with secret joy: For then with dire remorse, and conscious shame, The conclusion of this speech is very artful: Helen ascribes her seduction to Venus, and mentions nothing of Paris. Instead of naming Troy, she conceals it, and only says she was carry'd thither, leaving Troy to the imagination of Menelaus; she suffers not herself to mention names so odious now to herself, and ever to Menelaus, as Paris and Troy. She compliments Menelaus very handsomely, and says, that he wanted no accomplishment either in mind or body: It being the nature of man not to resent the injuries of a wife so much upon the account of her being corrupted, but of the preference she gives to another person; he looks upon such a preference as the most affecting part of the injury. Eustathius. I view'd th'effects of that disastrous flame, Which kindled by th'imperious Queen of love, Constrain'd me from my native realm to rove: And oft in bitterness of soul deplor'd My absent daughter, and my dearer Lord; Admir'd among the first of human race, For ev'ry gift of mind, and manly grace. Right well, reply'd the King, your speech displays The judgment of the Poet in continuing the story concerning Ulysses is not observ'd by any Commentator. Ulysses is the chief Heroe of the Poem, every thing should have a reference to him, otherwise the narration stands still without any advance towards the conclusion of it. The Poet therefore to keep Ulysses in our minds, dwells upon his sufferings and adventures: he supplies his not appearing in the present scene of action, by setting his character before us, and continually forcing his prudence, patience, and valour upon our observation. He uses the same art and judgment with relation to Achilles in the Iliads: The Heroe of the Poem is absent from the chief scenes of action during much of the time which that Poem comprises, but he is continually brought into the mind of the Reader, by recounting his exploits and glory. The matchless merit of the chief you praise: Heroes in various climes my self have found, For martial deeds, and depth of thought renown'd; But Ithacus, unrival'd in his claim, May boast a title to the loudest fame: In battel calm he guides the rapid storm, Wise to resolve, and patient to perform. What wond'rous conduct in the chief appear'd, When the vast fabric of the Steed we rear'd! Some Dæmon anxious for the Trojan doom, It is the observation of Eustathius, that these words are very artfully introduced to vindicate Helen; They imply that what she acted was by compulsion, and to evidence this more clearly, Deiphobus is given her for an attendant as a spy upon her actions, that she might not conceal any thing that should happen, but act her part well, by endeavouring to deceive the Greeks in favour of Troy. It is the Dæmon, not Helen, that is in fault; this, continues Eustathius, answers many objections that lye against Helen: for if she was a real penitent, as she her self affirms, how comes she to endeavour to deceive the Greeks, by the disguise of her voice, into more misery than had yet arisen from a ten years war? Or indeed is it credible that any person could modulate her voice so artfully as to resemble so many voices? And how could the Greeks enclosed in the wooden horse believe that their wives who were in Greece, could be arriv'd in so short a space as they had been conceal'd there, from the various regions of Greece, and meet together in Troy? Would the wives of these Heroes come into an enemy's country when the whole army, except these latent Heroes, were retir'd from it? this is ridiculous and impossible. I must confess there is great weight in these objections: But Eustathius answers all by the interposition of the Dæmon; and by an idle tradition that Helen had the name of Echo, from the faculty of mimicking sounds; and that this gift was bestow'd upon her by Venus when she married Menelaus, that she might be able to detect him, if he should prove false to her bed, by imitating the voice of the suspected person: (but Menelaus had more occasion for this faculty than Helen.) As for the excuse of the Dæmon, it equally excuses all crimes: For instance, was Helen false to Menelaus? The Dæmon occasion'd it: Does she act an imposture to destroy all her Grecian friends, and even Menelaus? The Dæmon compels her to it: The Dæmon compels her to go with Deiphobus, to surround the horse thrice, to sound the sides of it, to endeavour to surprize the latent Greeks by an imitation of the voices of their wives, and in short, to act like a person that was very sincere in mischief. Dacier takes another course, and gives up Helen, but remarks the great address of Menelaus. Helen had, said she, long desired nothing so much as to return to Lacedæmon; and her heart had long been wholly turn'd to Menelaus: Menelaus is not at all convinc'd of this pretended sincerity; but it would have been too gross, after he had taken her again to his bed, to convict her of falshood: He therefore contents himself barely to reply, that some Dæmon, an enemy to the Greeks, had forc'd her to a conduct disagreeable to her sincerity. This (continues Dacier) is an artful, but severe Irony. As for the objection concerning the impossibility of the Greeks believing their wives could be in Troy; she answers, that the Authors of this objection have not sufficiently-consider'd human nature. The voice of a belov'd person might of a sudden, and by surprize, draw from any person a word involuntary, before he has time to make reflection. This undoubtedly is true, where circumstances make an imposture probable; but here is an impossibility; it is utterly impossible to believe the wives of these Heroes could be in Troy. Besides, Menelaus himself tells us, that even he had fallen into the snare, but Ulysses prevented it; this adds to the incredibility of the story; for if this faculty of mimickry was given upon his marriage with Helen, it was nothing new to him, he must be suppos'd to be acquainted with it, and consequently be the less liable to surprize: Nay it is not impossible, but the experiment might have been made upon him before Helen fled away with Paris. In short, I think this passage wants a further vindication: the circumstances are low, if not incredible. Virgil, the great imitator of Homer, has given us a very different and more noble description of the destruction of Troy: he has not thought fit to imitate him in this description. If we allow Helen to act by compulsion, to have fear'd the Trojans, and that Deiphobus was sent as a spy upon her actions; yet this is no vindication of her conduct: she still acts a mean part, and thro' fear becomes an accomplice in endeavouring to betray and ruin the Greeks. I shall just add, that after the death of Paris, Helen married Deiphobus; that the story of the wooden horse is probably founded upon the taking of Troy by an engine call'd a Horse, as the like engine was call'd a Ram by the Romans. Urg'd you with great Deiphobus to come, T' explore the fraud; with guile oppos'd to guile, Slow-pacing thrice around th'insidious pile; Each noted leader's name you thrice invoke, Your accent varying as their spouses spoke: The pleasing sounds each latent warrior warm'd, But most Tydides' and my heart alarm'd: To quit the steed we both impatient press, Threat'ning to answer from the dark recess. Unmov'd the mind of Ithacus remain'd, And the vain ardors of our love restrain'd: But Anticlus unable to controul, Spoke loud the languish of his yerning soul: Ulysses strait with indignation fir'd, (For so the common care of Greece requir'd) Firm to his lips his forceful hands apply'd, 'Till on his tongue the flutt'ring murmurs dy'd: Mean-time Minerva from the fraudful horse, Back to the Court of Priam bent your course. Inclement fate! Telemachus replies, Frail is the boasted attribute of wise: The leader, mingling with the vulgar host, Is in the common mass of matter lost! But now let sleep the painful waste repair Of sad reflection, and corroding care. He ceas'd; the menial fair that round her wait, At Helen's beck prepare the room of state: Beneath an ample Portico, they spread The downy fleece to form the slumbrous bed; And o'er soft palls of purple grain unfold Rich tapestry, stiff with inwoven gold: Then thro' th'illumin'd dome, to balmy rest Th'obsequious Herald guides each princely guest: While to his regal bow'r the King ascends, And beauteous Helen on her Lord attends. Soon as the morn, in orient purple drest, Unbarr'd the portal of the roseate East The Monarch rose; magnificent to view, Th'imperial mantle o'er his vest he threw; The glitt'ring zone athwart his shoulder cast A starry fauchion low-depending grac'd, Clasp'd on his feet th'embroider'd sandals shine, And forth he moves, majestic and divine: Instant to young Telemachus he press'd, And thus benevolent his speech address'd. Say, royal youth, sincere of soul report What cause hath led you to the Spartan court? Do public or domestic cares constrain This toilsome voyage o'er the surgy main? O highly favour'd delegate of Jove! (Replies the Prince) inflam'd with filial love, And anxious hope, to hear my parent's doom, A suppliant to your royal court I come. Our sovereign seat a lewd usurping race With lawless riot, and mis-rule disgrace; To pamper'd insolence devoted fall Prime of the flock, and choicest of the stall: For wild ambition wings their bold desire, And all to mount th'imperial bed aspire. But prostrate I implore, oh King! relate The mournful series of my father's fate: Each known disaster of the Man disclose, Born by his mother to a world of woes! Recite them! nor in erring pity fear To wound with storied grief the filial ear: If e'er Ulysses, to reclaim your right, Avow'd his zeal in council or in fight, If Phrygian camps the friendly toils attest, To the sire's merit give the son's request. Deep from his inmost soul Atrides sigh'd, And thus indignant to the Prince reply'd: Heav'ns! wou'd a soft, inglorious, dastard train Menelaus is fir'd with indignation at the injuries offer'd his friend by the Suitors: he breaks out into an exclamation, and in a just contempt vouchsafes not to mention them: he thinks he fully distinguishes whom he intends, by calling them ????????? ????? those cowards. The comparison which he introduces is very just, they are the Fawns, Ulysses is the Lion. This is the first Simile that Homer has inserted in the Odyssey; but I cannot think it proceeded from a barrenness of invention, or thro' phlegm in the declension of his years, as some have imagin'd. The nature of the Poem requires a difference of stile from the Iliad: The Iliad rushes along like a torrent; the Odyssey flows gently on like a deep stream, with a smooth tranquillity: Achilles is all fire, Ulysses all wisdom. The Simile in Homer is really beautiful; but in Hobbs ridiculous. As when a stag and hind ent'ring the den Of th'absent Lion, lulls his whelps with tales, Of hills and dales; the Lion comes agen, And tears them into pieces with his nails. Can any thing be more foreign to the sense of Homer, or worse translated? He construes ???????? ????????, by telling stories of hills and dales to the Lion's whelps, instead of Juga investigat: but such mistakes are so frequent in Hobbs, that one would almost suspect his learning in Greek: he has disgraced the best Poet, and a very great Historian; Homer, and Thucydides. An absent heroe's nuptial joys profane! So with her young, amid the woodland shades A tim'rous hind the lion's court invades, Leaves in that fatal laire the tender fawns, Climbs the green cliff, or feeds the flow'ry lawns: Mean-time return'd, with dire remorseless sway The monarch-savage rends the trembling prey. With equal fury, and with equal fame, Ulysses soon shall re-assert his claim. O Jove, supreme, whom Gods and men revere! And Apollo. thou, to whom 'tis giv'n to gild the sphere! With pow'r congenial join'd, propitious aid The chief adopted by the martial maid! Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when contending on the Lesbian shore The Poet here gives an account of one of Ulysses's adventures. Philomelides was King of Lesbos, and Eustathius observes, that there was a tradition that Ulysses and Diomedes slew him, and turn'd a stately monument he had rais'd for himself into a public place for the reception of strangers. His prowess Philomelides confess'd, And loud-acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd: Then soon th'invaders of his bed and throne, Their love presumptuous shall with life atone. With patient ear, oh royal youth, attend The storied labours of thy father's friend: Fruitful of deeds, the copious tale is long, But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue: Learn what I heard the sea-born Seer relate, Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate. Long on th'Ægyptian coast by calms confin'd, Heav'n to my fleet refus'd a prosp'rous wind: No vows had we prefer'd, nor victim slain! For this the Gods each fav'ring gale restrain. Jealous, to see their high behests obey'd. Severe, if men th'eternal rights evade! High o'er a gulphy sea, the Pharian Isle This description of Pharos has given great trouble to the Critics and Geographers; it is generally concluded, that the distance of Pharos is about seven Stadia from Alexandria; Ammianus Marcellinus mentions this very passage thus, lib. 22. Insula Pharos, ubi Protea cum Phocarum gregibus diversatum Homerus fabulatur inflatius, a civitatis littore mille passibus disparata, or, about a mile distant from the shores. How then comes Homer to affirm it to be distant a full day's sail? Dacier answers, that Homer might have heard that the Nile, continually bringing down much earthy substance, had enlarg'd the continent: and knowing it not to be so distant in his time, took the liberty of a Poet, and describ'd it as still more distant in the days of Menelaus. But Dacier never sees a mistake in Homer. Had his Poetry been worse if he had describ'd the real distance of Pharos? It is allowable in a Poet to disguise the truth, to adorn his story; but what ornament has he given his Poetry by this enlargement? Bochart has fully prov'd that there is no accession to the Continent from any substance that the Nile brings down with it: the violent agitation of the seas prohibit it from lodging, and forming itself into solidity. Eratosthenes is of opinion, that Homer was ignorant of the mouths of Nile: but Strabo answers, that his silence about them is not an argument of his ignorance, for neither has he ever mention'd where he was born. But Strabo does not enter fully into the meaning of Eratosthenes: Eratosthenes does not mean that Homer was ignorant of the mouths of Nile from his silence, but because he places Pharos at the distance of a whole day's sail from the Continent. The only way to unite this inconsistence is to suppose, that the Poet intended to specify the Pelusiac mouth of Nile, from which Pharos stands about a day's sail: but this is submitted to the Critics. I can't tell whether one should venture to make use of the word Nile in the translation, it is doubtless an Anachronism; that name being unknown in the times of Homer and Menelaus, when the Nile was call'd Ægyptus. Homer in this very book ? ????????? ??? ?????? ????????. Yet on the other hand, this name of Ægyptus is so little known, that a common Reader would scarce distinguish the river from the country; and indeed universal custom has obtain'd for using the Latin name instead of the Grecian, in many other instances which are equally Anachronisms. Witness all the names of the Gods and Goddesses throughout Homer. Jupiter for Zeus, Juno for Erè, Neptune for Posidaon, &amp;c. Fronts the deep roar of disemboguing Nile: Her distance from the shore, the course begun At dawn, and ending with the setting sun, A gally measures; when the stiffer gales Rise on the poop, and fully stretch the sails. There anchor'd vessels safe in harbour lye, Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply. And now the twentieth sun descending, laves His glowing axle in the western waves; Still with expanded sails we court in vain Propitious winds, to waft us o'er the main: And the pale mariner at once deplores His drooping vigour, and exhausted stores. When lo! a bright cærulean form appears, The fair Eidothea! to dispel my fears; Proteus her sire divine. With pity press'd, Me sole the daughter of the deep address'd; What-time, with hunger pin'd, my absent mates Roam the wild Isle in search of rural cates, Bait the barb'd steel, and from the fishy stood Menelaus says, hunger was so violent among his companions, that they were compell'd to eat fish. Plutarch in his Symposiacs observes, that among the Ægyptians, Syrians, and Greeks, to abstain from fish was esteem'd a piece of sanctity; that tho' the Greeks were encamp'd upon the Hellespont, there is not the least intimation that they eat fish, or any sea-provision; and that the companions of Ulysses, in the 12?? book of the Odyssey, never sought for fish till all their other provisions were consum'd, and that the same necessity compell'd them to eat the herds of the Sun which induced them to taste fish. No fish is ever offer'd in sacrifice: The Pythagoreans in particular command fish not to be eaten more strictly than any other animal: Fish afford no excuse at all for their destruction, they live as it were in another world, disturb not our air, consume not our fruits, or injure the waters; and therefore the Pythagoreans, who were unwilling to offer violence to any animals, fed very little, or not at all on fishes. I thought it necessary to insert this from Plutarch, because it is an observation that explains other passages in the sequel of the Odyssey. Appease th'afflictive fierce desire of food. Whoe'er thou art, (the azure Goddess cries,) Thy conduct ill deserves the praise of wise: Is death thy choice, or misery thy boast, That here inglorious on a barren coast Thy brave associates droop, a meagre train With famine pale, and ask thy care in vain? Struck with the kind reproach, I strait reply; Whate'er thy title in thy native sky, A Goddess sure! for more than mortal grace Speaks thee descendent of etherial race: Deem not, that here of choice my fleet remains; Some heav'nly pow'r averse my stay constrains: O, piteous of my fate, vouchsafe to shew, (For what's sequester'd from celestial view?) What pow'r becalms th'innavigable seas? What guilt provokes him, and what vows appease? I ceas'd, when affable the Goddess cry'd; Observe, and in the truths I speak confide: Th'oraculous Seer frequents the Pharian coast, From whose high bed my birth divine I boast: Proteus, a name tremendous o'er the main, Eustathius enumerates various opinions concerning Proteus; some understand Proteus allegorically to signify the first matter which undergoes all changes; others make him an emblem of true friendship, which ought not to be settled till it has been try'd in all shapes: others make Proteus a picture of a flatterer, who takes up all shapes, and suits himself to all forms, in compliance to the temper of the person whom he courts. The Greeks (observes Diodorus) imagin'd all these metamorphoses of Proteus to have been borrow'd from the practices of the Ægyptian Kings, who were accustom'd to wear the figures of Lions, Bulls or Dragons in their diadems, as emblems of Royalty, and sometimes that of Trees, &amp;c. not so much for ornament as terror. Others took Proteus to be an enchanter; and Eustathius recounts several that were eminent in this art, as Cratisthenes the Phliasian, (which Dacier renders by mistake Callisthenes the Physician) who when he pleased could appear all on fire, and assume other appearances to the astonishment of the spectators: such also was Xenophon, Scymnus of Tarentum, Philippides of Syracuse, Heraclitus of Mitylene, and Nymphodorus, all practisers of magical arts; and Eustathius recites that the Phocæ were made use of in their Incantations. Some write that Proteus was an Ægyptian tumbler, who could throw himself into variety of figures and postures; others, a Stage-player; others, that he was a great General, skill'd in all the arts and stratagems of war: Dacier looks upon him to have been an enchanter, or ????????????. 'Tis certain from Herodotus, that there was in the times of Menelaus a King named Proteus, who reign'd in Memphis; that Ægypt was always remarkable for those who excell'd in magical Arts; thus Jannes and Jambres chang'd, at least in appearance, a rod into a Serpent, and water into blood: It is not therefore improbable but that Menelaus hearing of him while he was in Ægypt, went to consult him as an Enchanter, which kind of men always pretended to fore-know events: This perhaps was the real foundation of the whole story concerning Proteus; the rest is the fiction and embellishment of the Poet, who ascribes to his Proteus whatever the credulity of men usually ascribes to Enchanters. The delegate of Neptune's watry reign. Watch with insidious care his known abode; There fast in chains constrain the various God: Who bound, obedient to superior force, Unerring will prescribe your destin'd course. If studious of your realms, you then demand Their state, since last you left your natal land; Instant the God obsequious will disclose Bright tracks of glory, or a cloud of woes, She ceas'd, and suppliant thus I made reply; O Goddess! on thy aid my hopes rely: Dictate propitious to my duteous ear, What arts can captivate the changeful Seer? For perilous th'assay, unheard the toil, T' elude the prescience of a God by guile. Thus to the Goddess mild my suit I end. Then she. Obedient to my rule, attend: When thro' the Zone of heav'n the mounted sun Hath journey'd half, and half remains to run; The Seer, while Zephyrs curl the swelling deep, Basks on the breezy shore, in grateful sleep, His oozy limbs. Emerging from the wave, The Phocæ swift surround his rocky cave, Frequent and full; the consecrated train Of Amphitrite. her, whose azure trident awes the main: There wallowing warm, th'enormous herd exhales An oily steam, and taints the noon-tide gales. To that recess, commodious for surprize, When purple light shall next suffuse the skies, With me repair; and from thy warrior band Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command: Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil, For strong the God, and perfected in guile. Stretch'd on the shelly shore, he first surveys The flouncing herd ascending from the seas; Their number summ'd, repos'd in sleep profound The scaly charge their guardian God surround: So with his batt'ring flocks the careful swain Abides, pavilion'd on the grassy plain. With pow'rs united, obstinately bold Invade him, couch'd amid the scaly fold: Instant he wears, elusive of the rape, The mimic force of every savage shape: Or glides with liquid lapse a murm'ring stream, Or wrapt in flame, he glows at every limb. Yet still retentive, with redoubled might Thro' each vain passive form constrain his flight. But when, his native shape resum'd, he stands This is founded upon the practice of Enchanters, who never give their answers, till they have astonish'd the imagination of those who consult them with their juggling delusions. Dacier. Patient of conquest, and your cause demands; The cause that urg'd the bold attempt declare, And sooth the vanquish'd with a victor's pray'r. The bands relax'd, implore the Seer to say What Godhead interdicts the wat'ry way? Who strait propitious, in prophetic strain Will teach you to repass th'unmeasur'd main, She ceas'd, and bounding from the shelfy shore, Round the descending nymph the waves redounding roar. High rapt in wonder of the future deed, With joy impetuous, to the port I speed: The wants of nature with repast suffice, 'Till night with grateful shade involv'd the skies, And shed ambrosial dews. Fast by the deep, Along the tented shore, in balmy sleep Our cares were lost. When o'er the eastern lawn, In saffron robes the Daughter of the dawn Advanc'd her rosy steps; before the bay, Due ritual honours to the Gods I pay: Then seek the place the sea-born nymph assign'd, With three associates of undaunted mind. Arriv'd, to form along th'appointed strand For each a bed, she scoops the hilly sand: Then from her azure car, the finny spoils Of four vast Phocæ takes, to veil her wiles; Beneath the finny spoils extended prone, Hard toil! the prophet's piercing eye to shun; New from the corse, the scaly frauds diffuse Unsavoury stench of oil, and brackish ooze: But the bright sea-maid's gentle pow'r implor'd, With nectar'd drops the sick'ning sense restor'd. Thus 'till the sun had travell'd half the skies, Ambush'd we lie, and wait the bold emprise: When thronging thick to bask in open air, The flocks of Ocean to the strand repair: Couch'd on the sunny sand, the monsters sleep: Then Proteus mounting from the hoary deep, Surveys his charge, unknowing of deceit: (In order told, we make the sum compleat.) Pleas'd with the false review, secure he lies, And leaden slumbers press his drooping eyes. Rushing impetuous forth, we strait prepare A furious onset with the sound of war, And shouting seize the God: our force t'evade Proteus has, thro' the whole story, been describ'd as a God who knew all things; it may then be ask'd, how comes it that he did not foreknow the violence that was design'd against his own person? and is it not a contradiction, that he who knew Menelaus without information, should not know that he lay in ambush to seize him? The only answer that occurs to me is, that these enchanters never pretend to have an inherent fore-knowledge of events, but learn things by magical arts, and by recourse to the secrets of their profession; so that Proteus having no suspicion, had not consulted his art, and consequently might be surprized by Menelaus: So far is agreeable to the pretensions of such deluders: The Poet indeed has drawn him in colours stronger than life; but Poetry adds or detracts at pleasure, and is allow'd frequently to step out of the way, to bring a foreign ornament into the story. His various arts be soon resumes in aid: A Lion now, he curls a surgy mane; Sudden, our bands a spotted Pard restrain; Then arm'd with tusks, and lightning in his eyes, A Boar's obscener shape the God belies: On spiry volumes there a Dragon rides; Here, from our strict embrace a Stream he glides: And last, sublime his stately growth he rears, A Tree, and well-dissembled foliage wears. Vain efforts! with superior pow'r compress'd, Me with reluctance thus the Seer address'd. Say, son of Atreus, say what God inspir'd This daring fraud, and what the boon desir'd? I thus; O thou, whose certain eye foresees The fix'd event of fate's remote decrees; After long woes, and various toil endur'd, Still on this desert Isle my fleet is moor'd; Unfriended of the gales. All-knowing! say What Godhead interdicts the wat'ry way? What vows repentant will the Pow'r appease, To speed a prosp'rous voyage o'er the seas? To Jove, (with stern regard the God replies,) Homer continually inculcates morality, and piety to the Gods; he gives in this place a great instance of the necessity of it. Menelaus cannot succeed in any of his actions, till he pays due honours to the Gods; the neglect of sacrifice is the occasion of all his calamity, and the performance of it opens a way to all his future prosperity. And all th'offended synod of the skies; Just hecatombs with due devotion slain, Thy guilt absolv'd, a prosp'rous voyage gain. To the firm sanction of thy fate attend! An exile thou, nor cheering face of friend, Nor sight of natal shore, nor regal dome Shalt yet enjoy, but still art doom'd to roam. Once more the Nile, who from the secret source Homer, it must be confess'd, gives the epithet ???????? generally to all rivers; if he had used it here peculiarly, there might have been room to have imagin'd that he had been acquainted with the true cause of the inundations of this famous river: The word ???????? implies it: For it is now generally agreed, that these prodigious inundations proceed from the vast rains and the melting of the snows on the mountains of the Moon in Æthiopia, about the autumnal Æquinox; when those rains begin to fall, the river by degrees increases, and as they abate, it decreases; the word ???????? is therefore peculiarly proper when apply'd to the Nile; for tho' all rivers depend upon the waters that fall from the air, or ?? ????, yet the Nile more especially; for when the rain ceases, the Nile consists only of seven empty channels. Of Jove's high seat descends with sweepy force, Must view his billows white beneath thy oar, And altars blaze along his sanguine shore. Then will the Gods, with holy pomp ador'd, To thy long vows a safe return accord. He ceas'd: heart-wounded with afflictive pain, (Doom'd to repeat the perils of the main, A shelfy tract, and long!) O Seer, I cry, To the stern sanction of th'offended sky My prompt obedience bows. But deign to say, What fate propitious, or what dire dismay Sustain those Peers, the reliques of our host, Whom I with Nestor on the Phrygian coast Embracing left? Must I the warriors weep, Whelm'd in the bottom of the monstrous deep? Or did the kind domestic friend deplore The breathless heroes on their native shore? Press not too far, reply'd the God; but cease To know, what known will violate thy peace: Too curious of their doom! with friendly woe Thy breast will heave, and tears eternal flow. Part live; the rest, a lamentable train! Range the dark bounds of Pluto's dreary reign. Two, foremost in the roll of Mars renown'd, Whose arms with conquest in thy cause were crown'd, Fell by disastrous fate; by tempests tost, A third lives wretched on a distant coast. By Neptune rescu'd from Minerva's hate, On Gyræ, safe Oilean Ajax sate, His ship o'erwhelm'd: but frowning on the floods, Impious he roar'd defiance to the Gods: To his own prowess all the glory gave, The pow'r defrauding who vouchsaf'd to save. This heard the raging Ruler of the main; His spear, indignant for such high disdain, He launch'd; dividing with his forky mace Th'aerial summit from the marble base: The rock rush'd sea-ward, with impetuous roar Ingulf'd, and to th'abyss the boaster bore. It is in the original, He dy'd, having drunk the salt water. This verse has been omitted in many editions of Homer; and the Ancients, says Eustathius, blame Aristarchus for not marking it as a verse that ought to be rejected; the simplicity of it consists in the sense, more than in the terms, and it is unworthy of Proteus to treat the death of Ajax with pleasantry, as he seems to do, by adding having drunk salt water: But why may not Proteus be suppos'd to be serious, and the terms ??????? ????, to imply no more than that he was drown'd in waves of the ocean? I know only one reason that can give any colour to the objection, viz. its being possibly become a vulgar expression, and used commonly in a ludicrous sense; then indeed it is to be avoided in Poetry; but it does not follow, because perhaps it might be used in this manner in the days of these Critics, that therefore it was so used in the days of Homer. What was poetical in the time of the Poet might be grown vulgar in the time of the Critics. By Juno's guardian aid, the wat'ry Vast Secure of storms, your royal brother past: 'Till coasting nigh the Cape, where Malea shrowds Her spiry cliffs amid surrounding clouds; A whirling gust tumultuous from the shore, Across the deep his lab'ring vessel bore. In an ill-fated hour the coast he gain'd, Where late in regal pomp Thyestes reign'd; But when his hoary honours bow'd to fate, Ægisthus govern'd in paternal state. The surges now subside, the tempest ends; From his tall ship the King of men descends: There fondly thinks the Gods conclude his toil! Far from his own domain salutes the soil: With rapture oft the verge of Greece reviews, And the dear turf with tears of joy bedews. Him thus exulting on the distant strand, A Spy distinguish'd from his airy stand; To bribe whose vigilance, Ægisthus told A mighty sum of ill-persuading gold: There watch'd this guardian of his guilty fear, 'Till the twelfth moon had wheel'd her pale career; And now admonish'd by his eye, to court With terror wing'd conveys the dread report. Of deathful arts expert, his Lord employs The ministers of blood in dark surprize: And twenty youths in radiant mail incas'd, Close ambush'd nigh the spacious hall he plac'd. Then bids prepare the hospitable treat: Vain shews of love to veil his felon hate! To grace the victor's welcome from the wars, A train of coursers, and triumphal cars Magnificent he leads: the royal guest Thoughtless of ill, accepts the fraudful feast. The troop forth issuing from the dark recess, With homicidal rage the King oppress! So, whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall, Dacier translates ????, by taureau a bull; and misunderstands Eustathius who directly says, that in the 2? Iliad the Poet compares Agamemnon to a bull, in this place to an oxe, ????? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ????? ????????. The one was undoubtedly design'd to describe the courage and majestic port of a warrior, the other to give us an image of a Prince falling in full peace and plenty, ?? ??? ??? ?????. The sov'reign of the herd is doom'd to fall. The partners of his fame and toils at Troy, Around their Lord, a mighty ruin! lye: Mix'd with the brave, the base invaders bleed; Ægisthus sole survives to boast the deed. He said; chill horrors shook my shiv'ring soul, Rack'd with convulsive pangs in dust I roul; And hate, in madness of extreme despair, To view the sun, or breathe the vital air. But when superior to the rage of woe, I stood restor'd, and tears had ceas'd to flow; Lenient of grief, the pitying God began.— Forget the brother, and resume the man: To fate's supreme dispose the dead resign, That care be fate's, a speedy passage thine. Still lives the wretch who wrought the death deplor'd, But lives a victim for thy vengeful sword; Unless with filial rage Orestes glow, And swift prevent the meditated blow: You timely will return a welcome guest, With him to share the sad funereal feast. He said: new thoughts my beating heart employ, My gloomy soul receives a gleam of joy. Fair hope revives; and eager I addrest The prescient Godhead to reveal the rest. The doom decreed of those disastrous Two I've heard with pain, but oh! the tale pursue; What third brave son of Mars the fates constrain To roam the howling desart of the main: Or in eternal shade if cold he lies, Proteus in the beginning of his relation had said, that one person was alive, and ramain'd enclosed by the ocean: How then comes Menelaus here to say, Give me an account of that other person who is alive, or dead? Perhaps the sorrow which Menelaus conceived for his friend Ulysses, might make him fear the worst; and Proteus adding enclos'd by the ocean, might give a suspicion that he was dead, the words being capable of ambiguity. However this be, it sets the friendship of Menelaus in a strong light: where friendship is sincere, a state of uncertainty is a state of fears, we dread even possibilities, and give them an imaginary certainty. Upon this, one of the finest compliments that a Poet ever made to a patron turns, that of Horace to Mæcenas, in the first of the Epodes. It may not perhaps be disagreeable to the Reader to observe, that Virgil has borrow'd this story of Proteus from Homer, and translated it almost literally. Rapine says, that Homer's description is more ingenious and fuller of invention, but Virgil's more judicious. I wish that Critic had given his reasons for his opinion. I believe in general, the plan of the Iliad and Odyssey is allow'd by the best of Critics to be more perfect than that of the Æneis. Homer, with respect to the unity of time, has the advantage very manifestly; Rapine confesses it, and Aristotle proposes him as an example to all Epic Authors. Where then is the superiority of judgment? Is it that there are more fabulous, I mean incredible, stories in Homer than Virgil? as that of the Cyclops, the ships of Alcinous, &amp;c. Virgil has imitated most of these bold fables, and the story of the ships of Alcinous is not more incredible than the transformation of the ships of Æneas. But this is too large a subject to be discuss'd in the compass of these Annotations. In particular passages I freely allow the preference to Virgil, as in the descent of Æneas into hell, &amp;c. but in this story of Proteus, I cannot see any superiority of judgment. Virgil is little more than a translator; to shew the particulars would be too tedious: I refer it to the Reader to compare the two Authors, and shall only instance in one passage. ????? ?? ???? ???????? ??????????, ???? ?? ??????, ????????. ???? ? ????? ?????? ????????? ??????, ???? ???? ???????? ???? ?????? ????????? ????? ?????? ??????, ??? ???????? ??? ????? ???, ?????? ?? ????? ????, ??? ???????? ?????????? &amp;c Cum clamore ruit magno, manicisque jacentem Occupat: ille suæ contra non immemor artis, Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum, Ignemque, horribilemque feram, fluviumque liquentem. &amp;c. Homer has a manifest advantage in the occasion of the story: The loss of a few bees seems to be a cause too trivial for an undertaking so great as the surprize of a Deity; whereas the whole happiness of Menelaus depends upon this consultation of Proteus: This is a far more important cause, and consequently in this respect something more is due to Homer, than the sole honour of an inventor. Provoke new sorrow from these grateful eyes. That chief (rejoin'd the God) his race derives From Ithaca, and wond'rous woes survives; Laertes' son: girt with circumfluous tides, He still calamitous constraint abides. Him in Calypso's cave of late I view'd, When streaming grief his faded cheek bedew'd. But vain his pray'r, his arts are vain to move Th'enamour'd Goddess, or elude her love: His vessel sunk, and dear companions lost, He lives reluctant on a foreign coast. But oh belov'd by heav'n! reserv'd to thee A happier lot the smiling fates decree: Free from that law, beneath whose mortal sway Matter is chang'd, and varying forms decay; Elysium shall be thine; the blissful plains This is the only place in which the Elysian field is mention'd in Homer. The conjectures of the Ancients are very various about it: Plato in his Phæd. places it in cœlo stellato, or the region of the Stars; but since Homer fixes it, ??? ??????? ?????, or (as Milton expresses it) at the earth's green end, I will pass over the conjectures of others, especially since the ??????? ?????, by which others express Elysium, confines it to this world. Strabo, says Eustathius, places it not far from Maurusia, that lies near the Streights: It is suppos'd by Bochart, as Dacier observes, that the fable is of Phœnician extraction, that Alizuth in Hebrew signifies joy or exultation, which word the Greeks, adapting to their way of pronunciation, call'd Elysius. If this be true, I should come into an opinion that has much prevail'd, that the Greeks had heard of Paradise from the Hebrews; and that the Hebrews describing Paradise as a place of Alizuth, or joy, gave occasion to all the fables of the Grecian Elysium. Of utmost earth, where Rhadamanthus reigns. Joys ever-young, unmix'd with pain or fear, Fill the wide circle of th'eternal year: Stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime: The fields are florid with unfading prime: From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow, Mold the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow; But from the breezy deep, the Blest inhale The fragrant murmurs of the western gale. This grace peculiar will the Gods afford To thee the Son of Jove, and beauteous Helen's Lord. He ceas'd, and plunging in the vast profound, Beneath the God the whirling billows bound. Then speeding back, involv'd in various thought, My friends attending at the shore I sought. Arriv'd, the rage of hunger we controll, 'Till night with silent shade invests the pole; Then lose the cares of life in pleasing rest.— Soon as the morn reveals the roseate East, With sails we wing the masts, our anchors weigh, Unmoor the fleet, and rush into the sea. Rang'd on the banks, beneath our equal oars White curl the waves, and the vex'd ocean roars. Then steering backward from the Pharian Isle, We gain the stream of Jove-descended Nile: There quit the ships, and on the destin'd shore With ritual hecatombs the Gods adore: Their wrath aton'd, to Agamemnon's name A Cenotaph I raise of deathless fame. These rites to piety and grief discharg'd, The friendly Gods a springing gale inlarg'd: The fleet swift tilting o'er the surges flew, 'Till Grecian cliffs appear'd, a blissful view! Thy patient ear hath heard me long relate A story, fruitful of disastrous fate: And now, young Prince, indulge my fond request; Be Sparta honour'd with his royal guest, 'Till from his eastern goal, the joyous sun His twelfth diurnal race begins to run. Mean-time my train the friendly gifts prepare, Three sprightly coursers, and a polish'd car: How comes it to pass that Menelaus proffers three horses to Telemachus? This was a compleat set among the Ancients, they used one Pole-horse and two leaders. Eustathius. With these, a goblet of capacious mold, Figur'd with art to dignify the gold, (Form'd for libation to the Gods,) shall prove A pledge and monument of sacred love. My quick return, young Ithacus rejoin'd, Damps the warm wishes of my raptur'd mind: Did not my fate my needful haste constrain, Charm'd by your speech, so graceful and humane, Lost in delight the circling year wou'd roll, While deep attention fix'd my list'ning soul. But now to Pyle permit my destin'd way, My lov'd associates chide my long delay. In dear remembrance of your royal grace, I take the present of the promis'd Vase; The coursers for the champian sports, retain; That gift our barren rocks will render vain: This passage where Telemachus refuses the horses has been much observ'd, and turn'd to a moral sense, viz. as a lesson to men to desire nothing but what is suitable to their conditions. Horace has introduced it into his Epistles. Haud male Telemachus proles patientis Ulyssei; Non est aptus equis Ithacæ locus, ut neque planis Porrectus spatiis, nec multæ prodigus herbæ: Atride, magis apta tibi tua dona relinquam. This is the reason why Ulysses (as Eustathius observes upon the 10?? of the Iliads) leaves the horses of Rhesus to the disposal of Diomedes; so that the same spirit of Wisdom reign'd in Telemachus, that was so remarkable in Ulysses. This is the reason why Menelaus smil'd; it was not at the frankness or simplicity of Telemachus, but it was a smile of joy, to see the young Prince inherit his father's wisdom. It is the remark of Eustathius, that Telemachus is far from exalting the nature of his country; he confesses it to be barren, and more barren than the neighbouring Islands; yet that natural and laudable affection which all worthy persons have for their country makes him prefer it to places of a more happy situation. This appears to me a replication to what Menelaus had before offer'd concerning the transplantation of Ulysses to Sparta; this is contain'd in ??????????; and then the meaning is, 'Tis true Ithaca is a barren region, yet more desirable than this country of Lacedæmon, this ????????? ????. It is the more probable from the offer of horses which Menelaus had then made, and is also another reason for the smile of Menelaus. Eustathius remarks that Menelaus, tho' he has expressed the greatest friendship for Ulysses, yet makes no offer to restore the fortunes of his friend by any military assistance; tho' he had a most fair opportunity given him to repay the past kindness of Ulysses to his wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus; and how comes Telemachus not to ask it either of Nestor or Menelaus? He answers, that this depended upon the uncertainty they were yet under, concerning the life of Ulysses. But the truer reason in my opinion is, that the nature of Epic Poetry requires a contrary conduct: The Heroe of the Poem is to be the chief agent, and the re-establishment of his fortunes must be owing to his own wisdom and valour. I have enlarg'd upon this already, so that there is no occasion in this place to insist upon it. Horrid with cliffs, our meagre land allows Thin herbage for the mountain-goat to browze, But neither mead nor plain supplies, to feed The sprightly courser, or indulge his speed: To sea-surrounded realms the Gods assign Small tract of fertile lawn, the least to mine. His hand the King with tender passion press'd, And smiling thus, the royal Youth address'd: O early worth! a soul so wise, and young, Proclaims you from the sage Ulysses sprung. Selected from my stores, of matchless price An urn shall recompence your prudent choice: Not mean the massy mold, of silver grac'd By Vulcan's art, the verge with gold enchas'd: A pledge the sceptred pow'r of Sidon gave, When to his realm I plow'd the orient wave. Thus they alternate; while with artful care The menial train the regal feast prepare: The firstlings of the flock are doom'd to dye; Rich fragrant wines the cheering bowl supply; A female band the gift of Ceres bring; And the gilt roofs with genial triumph ring. Mean-while, in Ithaca, the Suitor-pow'rs In active games divide their jovial hours: In Areas vary'd with mosaic art, Some whirl the disk, and some the jav'lin dart. Aside, sequester'd from the vast resort, Antinous sate spectator of the sport; With great Eurymachus, of worth confest, And high descent, superior to the rest; Whom young Noëmon lowly thus addrest. My ship equip'd within the neighb'ring port, The Prince, departing for the Pylian court, Requested for his speed; but, courteous, say When steers he home, or why this long delay? For Elis I shou'd sail with utmost speed, T'import twelve mares which there luxurious feed, And twelve young mules, a strong laborious race, New to the plow, unpractis'd in the trace. Unknowing of the course to Pyle design'd, A sudden horror seiz'd on either mind: The Prince in rural bow'r they fondly thought, Numb'ring his flocks and herds, not far remote. Relate, Antinous cries, devoid of guile, When spread the Prince his sail for distant Pyle? Did chosen chiefs across the gulphy main Attend his voyage, or domestic train? Spontaneous did you speed his secret course, Or was the vessel seiz'd by fraud or force? With willing duty, not reluctant mind, (Noëmon cry'd) the vessel was resign'd. Who in the balance, with the great affairs Of courts, presume to weigh their private cares? With him, the peerage next in pow'r to you: And Mentor, captain of the lordly crew, Or some Celestial in his rev'rend form, Safe from the secret rock and adverse storm, Pilots their course: For when the glimm'ring ray Of yester dawn disclos'd the tender day, Mentor himself I saw, and much admir'd.— Then ceas'd the Youth, and from the court retir'd: Confounded and appall'd, th'unfinish'd game The Suitors quit, and all to council came: Antinous first th'assembled Peers addrest, Rage sparkling in his eyes, and burning in his breast. O shame to manhood! shall one daring boy The scheme of all our happiness destroy? Fly unperceiv'd, seducing half the flow'r Of nobles, and invite a foreign pow'r? The pond'rous engine rais'd to crush us all, Recoiling, on his head is sure to fall. Instant prepare me, on the neighb'ring strand, With twenty chosen mates a vessel mann'd; For ambush'd close beneath the Samian shore We have here another use which the Poet makes of the voyage of Telemachus. Eustathius remarks that these incidents not only diversify but enliven the Poem. But it may be ask'd why the Poet makes not use of so fair an opportunity to insert a gallant action of Telemachus, and draw him not as eluding, but defeating his adversaries? The answer is easy; That the Suitors sail'd compleatly arm'd, and Telemachus unprovided of any weapons: and therefore Homer consults credibility, and forbears to paint his young Heroe in the colours of a Knight in Romance, who upon all disadvantages engages and defeats his opposers. But then to what purpose is this ambush of the Suitors, and what part of the design of the Poem is carry'd on by it? The very chief aim of it; To shew the sufferings of Ulysses: He is unfortunate in all relations of life, as a King, as an husband, and here very eminently as a father; these sufferings are laid down in the proposition of the Odyssey as essential to the Poem, and consequently this ambush laid by the Suitors against the life of Telemachus is an essential ornament. His ship returning shall my spies explore: He soon his rashness shall with life atone, Seek for his father's fate, but find his own. With vast applause the sentence all approve; Then rise, and to the feastful hall remove: Swift to the Queen the Herald Medon ran, Who heard the consult of the dire Divan: Before her dome the royal matron stands, And thus the message of his haste demands. What will the Suitors? must my servant train Longinus in particular commends this speech as a true picture of a person that feels various emotions of soul, and is born by every gust of passion from sentiment to sentiment, with sudden and unexpected transitions. There is some obscurity in the Greek, this arises from the warmth with which she speaks, she has not leisure to explain her self fully, a circumstance natural to a person in anger. Penelope gives a very beautiful picture of Ulysses: “The best of Princes are allow'd to have their favourites, and give a greater share of affection than ordinary to particular persons. But Ulysses was a father to all his people alike, and loved them all as his children; a father, tho' he bears a more tender affection to one child than to another, yet shews them all an equal treatment; thus also a good King is not sway'd by inclination, but justice, towards all his subjects. Dacier. One circumstance is very remarkable, and gives us a full view of a person in anger; at the very sight of Medon Penelope flies out into passion, she gives him not time to speak one syllable, but speaks her self as if all the Suitors were present, and reproaches them in the person of Medon, tho' Medon is just to her and Ulysses; but anger is an undistinguishing passion. What she says of ingratitude, recalls to my memory what is to be found in Laertius: Aristotle being ask'd what thing upon earth soonest grew old? reply'd, an Obligation. ?? ??????? ????????; respondit, ?????. Th'allotted labours of the day refrain, For them to form some exquisite repast? Heav'n grant this festival may prove their last! Or if they still must live, from me remove The double plague of luxury and love! Forbear, ye sons of insolence! forbear, In riot to consume a wretched heir. In the young soul illustrious thought to raise, Were ye not tutor'd with Ulysses' praise? Have not your fathers oft my Lord defin'd, Gentle of speech, beneficent of mind? Some Kings with arbitrary rage devour, Or in their tyrant-Minions vest the pow'r: Ulysses let no partial favours fall, The people's parent, he protected all: But absent now, perfidious and ingrate! His stores ye ravage, and usurp his state. He thus; O were the woes you speak the worst! They form a deed more odious and accurst; More dreadful than your boding soul divines: But pitying Jove avert the dire designs! The darling object of your royal care Is mark'd to perish in a deathful snare: Before he anchors in his native port, From Pyle re-sailing and the Spartan court, Horrid to speak! in ambush is decreed The hope and heir of Ithaca to bleed! Sudden she sunk beneath the weighty woes; The vital streams a chilling horror froze: The big round tear stands trembling in her eye, And on her tongue imperfect accents dye. At length, in tender language, interwove With sighs, she thus express'd her anxious love. Why rashly wou'd my son his fate explore, Ride the wild waves, and quit the safer shore? Were this passage to be render'd literally, it would run thus; climb the swift ships, which are horses to men on the seas. Eustathius observes the allusion is very just, and that the only doubt is, whether it be brought in opportunely by Penelope? it may be doubted, if the mind could find leisure to introduce such allusions? Dacier answers, that Penelope speaks thus thro' indignation: The grief that she conceives at the hardiness of men, in finding out a way to pass the seas as well as land, furnished her with these figures very naturally, for figures are agreeable to passion. Did he, with all the greatly wretched, crave A blank oblivion, and untimely grave? 'Tis not, reply'd the Sage, to Medon giv'n To know, if some inhabitant of heav'n, In his young breast the daring thought inspir'd: Or if alone with filial duty fir'd, The winds and waves he tempts in early bloom, Studious to learn his absent father's doom. The Sage retir'd: Unable to controul The mighty griefs that swell her lab'ring soul, Rolling convulsive on the floor, is seen The piteous object of a prostrate Queen. Words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies, And breath, to waste in unavailing cries. Around their sov'reign wept the menial fair, To whom she thus address'd her deep despair. Behold a wretch whom all the Gods consign To woe! Did ever sorrows equal mine? Long to my joys my dearest Lord is lost, His country's buckler, and the Grecian boast: Now from my fond embrace by tempests torn, Our other column of the state is born: Nor took a kind adieu, nor sought consent!— Unkind confed'rates in his dire intent! Ill suits it with your shews of duteous zeal, From me the purpos'd voyage to conceal: Tho' at the solemn midnight hour he rose, Why did you fear to trouble my repose? He either had obey'd my fond desire, Or seen his mother pierc'd with grief expire, Bid Dolius quick attend, the faithful slave Whom to my nuptial train Icarius gave, To tend the fruit-groves: With incessant speed He shall this violence of death decreed, To good Laertes tell. Experienc'd age May timely intercept their ruffian rage, Convene the tribes, the murd'rous plot reveal, And to their pow'r to save his race appeal. Then Euryclea thus. My dearest dread! Tho' to the sword I bow this hoary head, Or if a dungeon be the pain decreed, I own me conscious of th'unpleasing deed: Auxiliar to his flight, my aid implor'd, With wine and viands I the vessel stor'd: A solemn oath impos'd the secret seal'd, 'Till the twelfth dawn the light of heav'n reveal'd. Dreading th'effect of a fond mother's fear, He dar'd not violate your royal ear. But bathe, and in imperial robes array'd, Pay due devotions to the Minerva. martial maid, And rest affianc'd in her guardian aid. Send not to good Laertes, nor engage In toils of state the miseries of age: 'Tis impious to surmize, the pow'rs divine To ruin doom the Jove-descended line: Long shall the race of just Arcesius reign, And Isles remote enlarge his old domain. Dacier offers a Criticism upon these last words of Euryclea: It cannot be imagin'd these fertile fields can be spoken of Ithaca, Plutarch's description of it is entirely contradictory to this: “Ithaca, says he, is rough and mountainous, fit only to breed goats; upon cultivation it scarce yields any fruits, and these so worthless, as scarce to recompence the labour of gathering.” Homer therefore by this expression intended the other dominions of Ulysses, such as Cephalenia, &amp;c. But I question not that the whole dominions of Ulysses are included, Ithaca as well as Cephalenia; for tho' Ithaca was mountainous, yet the vallies were fruitful, according to the description of it in the 13?? of the Odyssey. The rugged soil allows no level space For flying chariots, or the rapid race; Yet not ungrateful to the Peasant's pain, Suffices fulness to the swelling grain: The loaded trees their various fruits produce, And clustring grapes afford a gen'rous juice, &amp;c. As for her remark upon ???????? it is of no validity; the word stands in opposition to ?????? and implies no more than here, or at a distance in general. The Queen her speech with calm attention hears, Her eyes restrain the silver-streaming tears: She bathes, and rob'd, the sacred dome ascends; Her pious speed a female train attends: The salted cakes in canisters are laid, And thus the Queen invokes Minerva's aid. Daughter, divine of Jove, whose arm can wield Th'avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield! If e'er Ulysses to thy fane prefer'd The best and choicest of his flock and herd; Hear, Goddess, hear, by those oblations won; And for the pious sire preserve the son: His wish'd return with happy pow'r befriend, And on the Suitors let thy wrath descend. She ceas'd; shrill ecstasies of joy declare The fav'ring Goddess present to the pray'r: The Suitors heard, and deem'd the mirthful voice It may be ask'd whence this conjecture of the Suitors arises? Penelope is describ'd as weeping grievously, and fainting away, and yet immediately the Suitors conclude she is preparing for the Nuptials. Eustathius answers, that undoubtedly the Suitors understood the Queen had purify'd her self with water, and supplicated the Goddess Minerva, tho' the Poet omits the relation of such little particularities. But whence is it that the Poet gives a greater share of wisdom to Euryclea than to Penelope? Penelope commands a servant to fly with the news of the absence of Telemachus to Laertes, which could not at all advantage Telemachus, and only grieve Laertes: Euryclea immediately diverts her from that vain intention, advises her to have recourse to heaven, and not add misery to the already miserable Laertes: This is Wisdom in Euryclea. But it must be confess'd that the other is Nature in Penelope: Euryclea is calm, Penelope in a passion: and Homer would have been a very bad painter of human Nature, if he had drawn Penelope thus heated with passion in the mild temper of Euryclea; grief and resentment give Penelope no time to deliberate, whereas Euryclea is less concern'd, and consequently capable of thinking with more tranquillity, A signal of her Hymenæal choice: Whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board; “Too late the Queen selects a second lord: “In evil hour the nuptial rite intends, “When o'er her son disastrous death impends.” Thus he, unskill'd of what the fates provide! But with severe rebuke Antinous cry'd. Antinous speaks thus in return to what had been before said by one of the Suitors concerning Telemachus, viz. “the Queen little imagines that her son's death approaches;” he fears lest Penelope should know their intentions, and hinder their measures by raising the subjects of Ithaca that still retain'd their fidelity. Dacier. These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain; Alarm not with discourse the menial train: The great event with silent hope attend; Our deeds alone our council must commend. His speech thus ended short, he frowning rose, And twenty chiefs renown'd for valour chose: Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides, Where anchor'd in the bay the vessel rides; Replete with mail, and military store, In all her tackle trim, to quit the shore. The desp'rate crew ascend, unfurl the sails; (The sea-ward prow invites the tardy gales) Then take repast, 'till Hesperus display'd His golden circlet in the western shade. Mean-time the Queen without refection due, Heart-wounded, to the bed of state withdrew: In her sad breast the Prince's fortunes roul, And hope and doubt alternate seize her soul. So when the wood-man's toyl her cave surrounds The Poet, to shew the majesty and high spirit of Penelope, compares her to a Lioness: He manages the allusion very artfully: he describes the Lioness not as exerting any dreadful act of violence, (for such a comparison is only proper to be apply'd to a Heroe) but inclosed by her enemies; which at once shews both her danger and nobleness of spirit under it: It is in the Greek ?????? ??????, which may signify either, a circle of toils or nets, or a circle of enemies: The former is perhaps preferable, as corresponding best with the condition of Penelope, who was surrounded with the secret ambushes and snares of the Suitors. Eustathius. And with the hunter's cry the grove resounds; With grief and rage the mother-lion stung, Fearless herself, yet trembles for her young. While pensive in the silent slumb'rous shade, Sleep's gentle pow'rs her drooping eyes invade; Minerva, life-like on imbody'd air, We have here an imaginary Being introduc'd by the Poet: The whole is manag'd with great judgment; It is short, because it has not a direct and immediate relation to the progress of the Poem, and because such imaginary entercourses have ever been looked upon as sudden in appearance, and as sudden in vanishing away. The use the Poet makes of it, is to relieve Penelope from the extremity of despair, that she may act her part in the future scenes with courage and constancy. We see it is Minerva who sends this phantom to Penelope to comfort her: Now this is an allegory to express that as soon as the violence of sorrow was over, the mind of Penelope return'd to some degree of tranquillity: Minerva is no more than the result of her own reflection and wisdom, which banish'd from her breast those melancholy apprehensions. The manner likewise of its introduction is not less judicious; the mind is apt to dwell upon those objects in sleep which make a deep impression when awake: This is the foundation of the Poet's fiction; it is no more than a dream which he here describes, but he cloaths it with a body, gives it a momentary existence, and by this method exalts a low circumstance into dignity and Poetry. Impress'd the form of Iphthima the fair: (Icarius' daughter she, whose blooming charms Allur'd Eumelus to her virgin-arms; A sceptred Lord, who o'er the fruitful plain Of Thessaly wide stretch'd his ample reign:) As Pallas will'd, along the sable skies To calm the Queen the Phantom-sister flies. Swift on the regal dome descending right, The bolted Valves are pervious to her flight. Close to her head the pleasing vision stands, And thus performs Minerva's high commands. O why, Penelope, this causeless fear, To render sleep's soft blessing unsincere? Alike devote to sorrow's dire extreme The day reflection, and the midnight dream! Thy son, the Gods propitious will restore, And bid thee cease his absence to deplore. To whom the Queen, (whilst yet her pensive mind Was in the silent gates of sleep confin'd) O sister, to my soul for ever dear, Why this first visit to reprove my fear? How in a realm so distant shou'd you know From what deep source my ceaseless sorrows flow? To all my hope my royal Lord is lost, His country's buckler, and the Grecian boast: And with consummate woe to weigh me down, In the original, Penelope says plainly, she is more concern'd for her son than her husband. I shall translate Dacier's observation upon this passage. We ought not to reproach Penelope for this seemingly shocking declaration, in preferring a son to an husband: Her sentiment is natural and just; she had all the reason in the world to believe that Ulysses was dead, so that all her hopes, all her affection was entirely placed upon Telemachus: His loss therefore must unavoidably touch her with the highest degree of sensibility; if he is lost, she can have recourse to no second comfort. But why may we not allow the reason which Penelope her self gives for this superiority of sorrow for Telemachus? “Telemachus, says she, is unexperienc'd in the world, and unable to contend with difficulties; whereas Ulysses knew how to extricate himself upon all emergencies.” This is a sufficient reason why she should fear more for Telemachus than Ulysses: Her affection might be greater for Ulysses than Telemachus, yet her fears might be stronger for the son than the husband, Ulysses being capable to surmount dangers by experience, Telemachus being new to all difficulties. The heir of all his honours, and his crown, My darling son is fled! an easy prey To the fierce storms, or men more fierce than they: Who in a league of blood associates sworn, Will intercept th'unwary Youth's return. Courage resume, the shadowy form reply'd, In the protecting care of heav'n confide: On him attends the blue-ey'd martial Maid; What earthly can implore a surer aid? Me now the guardian Goddess deigns to send, To bid thee patient his return attend. The Queen replies: If in the blest abodes, A Goddess thou, hast commerce with the Gods; Say, breathes my Lord the blissful realm of light, Or lies he wrapt in ever-during night? Enquire not of his doom, the Phantom cries, It may be ask'd what is the reason of this conduct, and why should the Phantom refuse to relate any thing concerning the condition of Ulysses? Eustathius answers, that if the Phantom had related the full truth of the story, the Poem had been at an end; the very constitution of it requires that Ulysses should arrive unknown to all, but chiefly to his wife, as will appear in the prosecution of the story: The question is very natural for an affectionate wife to make concerning an absent husband; but this being an improper place for the discovery, the Poet defers the solution of it, 'till the unravelling of the whole in the conclusion of the Poem. The action of this book takes up the space of two nights and one day, so that from the opening of the Poem to the introduction of Ulysses are six days compleated. But how long a time Telemachus afterwards stay'd with Menelaus, is a question which has employ'd some modern French Critics; one of which maintains, that he stay'd no longer than these two nights at Lacedæmon: But it is evident from the sequel of the Odyssey, that Telemachus arriv'd again at Ithaca two days after Ulysses; but Ulysses was twenty nine days in passing from Ogygia to Ithaca, and consequently during that whole time Telemachus must have been absent from Ithaca. The ground of that Critick's mistake was from the silence of Homer as to the exact time of his stay, which was of no importance, being distinguish'd by no action, and only in an Episodical part. The same thing led me into the like error in the 33? Note on the second book, where it is said that Telemachus return'd to Ithaca in less than twelve days. I speak not all the counsel of the skies: Nor must indulge with vain discourse, or long, The windy satisfaction of the tongue. Swift thro' the valves the visionary fair Repass'd, and viewless mix'd with common air. The Queen awakes, deliver'd of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son's arrival wait. Mean-time the Suitors plow the wat'ry plain, Telemachus in thought already slain! When sight of less'ning Ithaca was lost, Their sail directed for the Samian coast, A small but verdant Isle appear'd in view, And Asteris th'advancing Pilot knew: An ample port the rocks projected form, To break the rowling waves, and ruffling storm: That safe recess they gain with happy speed, And in close ambush wait the murd'rous deed. The End of the First Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Departure of Ulysses from Calypso. Pallas in a Council of the Gods complains of the Detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso; whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso describ'd. She consents with much difficulty, and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, on which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwreck'd, and in the last danger of death; 'till Leucothea a Sea Goddess assists him, and after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phæacia. Ulysses makes his first entry in this book. It may be ask'd where properly is the beginning of the Action? It is not necessary that the beginning of the Action should be the beginning of the Poem; there is a natural and an artificial order, and Homer makes use of the latter. The Action of the Odyssey properly begins neither with the Poem, nor with the appearance of Ulysses here, but with the relation he makes of his departure from Troy in the ninth book. Bossu has very judiciously remark'd, that in the constitution of the fable, the Poet ought not to make the Departure of a Prince from his own country the foundation of his Poem, but his Return, and his stay in other places involuntary. For if the stay of Ulysses had been voluntary, he would have been guilty in some degree of all the disorders that happen'd during his absence. Thus in this book Ulysses first appears in a desolate Island, sitting in tears by the side of the Ocean, and looking upon it as the obstacle to his return. This artificial order is of great use, it cuts off all languishing and un-entertaining incidents, and passes over those intervals of time that are void of action; it gives continuity to the story, and at first transports the Reader into the middle of the subject. In the beginning of the Odyssey, the Gods command Mercury to go down to the Island of Ogygia, and charge Calypso to dismiss Ulysses: one would think the Poem was to end in the compass of a few lines, the Poet beginning the action so near the end of the story; and we wonder how he finds matter to fill up his Poem, in the little space of time that intervenes between his first appearance and his re-establishment. This book, as well as the first, opens with an Assembly of the Gods. This is done to give an importance to his Poem, and to prepare the mind of the Reader to expect every thing that is great and noble, when Heaven is engag'd in the care and protection of his Heroes. Both these Assemblies are placed very properly, so as not to interrupt the series of action: The first assembly of the Gods is only preparatory to introduce the action; and the second is no more than a bare transition from Telemachus to Ulysses; from the recital of the transactions in Ithaca, to what more immediately regards the person of Ulysses. In the former council, both the Voyage of Telemachus and the Return of Ulysses were determin'd at the same time: The day of that assembly is the first day both of the principal action, which is the return of Ulysses) and of the incident, which is the voyage of Telemachus; with this difference, that the incident was immediately put in practice, by the descent of Minerva to Ithaca; and the execution of it takes up the four preceding books; whereas the principal action was only then prepared, and the execution deferr'd to the present book, where Mercury is actually sent to Calypso. Eustathius therefore judges rightly when he says, that, in the first council, the safety alone of Ulysses was propos'd; but the means how to bring it about are here under consultation, which makes the necessity of the second council. The saffron Morn, with early blushes spread, Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed; With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, And gild the courts of heav'n with sacred light. Then met th'eternal Synod of the sky, Before the God who thunders from on high, Supreme in might, sublime in majesty. Pallas, to these, deplores th'unequal fates Of wise Ulysses, and his toils relates; Her heroe's danger touch'd the pitying Pow'r, The Nymphs seducements, and the magic bow'r. Thus she began her plaint. Immortal Jove! And you who fill the blissful seats above! Let Kings no more with gentle mercy sway, Or bless a people willing to obey, But crush the nations with an iron rod, And ev'ry Monarch be the scourge of God: If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove, Who rul'd his subjects with a father's love. Sole in an isle, encircled by the main, Abandon'd, banish'd from his native reign, Unblest he sighs, detain'd by lawless charms, And press'd unwilling in Calypso's arms. Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey, Nor oars to cut th'immeasurable way. And now fierce traytors, studious to destroy His only son, their ambush'd fraud employ, Who pious, following his great father's fame, To sacred Pylos and to Sparta came. What words are these (reply'd the Pow'r who forms The clouds of night, and darkens heav'n with storms) Is not already in thy soul decreed, The chief's return shall make the guilty bleed? What cannot Wisdom do? Thou may'st restore The son in safety to his native shore; While the fell foes who late in ambush lay, With fraud defeated measure back their way. Then thus to Hermes the command was giv'n, Hermes, thou chosen messenger of heav'n! Go, to the nymph be these our orders born: 'Tis Jove's decree Ulysses shall return: The patient man shall view his old abodes, Nor help'd by mortal hand, nor guiding Gods; This passage is intricate: Why should Jupiter command Ulysses to return without the guidance either of man or God? Ulysses had been just declar'd the care of Heaven, why should he be thus suddenly abandon'd? Eustathius answers, that it is spoken solely with respect to the voyage which he immediately undertakes. This indeed shews a reason why this command is given; if he had been under the guidance of a God, the shipwreck (that great incident which brings about the whole Catastrophe of the Poem) must have been prevented by his power; and as for men, where were they to be procur'd in a desolate island? What confirms this opinion is, that during the whole shipwreck of Ulysses, there is no interposition of a Deity, nor even of Pallas, who used to be his constant guardian; the reason is, because this command of Jupiter forbids all assistance to Ulysses: Leucothea indeed assists him, but it is not till he is shipwreck'd. It appears further, that this interdiction respects only the voyage from Ogygia, because Jupiter orders that there shall be no assistance from man, ???? ???? ?????, ???? ????????; but Ulysses is transported from Phæacia to Ithaca, ???????? ?????, or by the assistance of the Phæacians, as Eustathius observes; and therefore what Jupiter here speaks has relation only to the present voyage. Dacier understands this to be meant of any visible assistance only: but this seems a collusion; for whether the Gods assist visibly or invisibly, the effects are the same; and a Deity unseen might have preserv'd Ulysses from storms, and directly guided him to his own country. But it was necessary for the design of Homer, that Ulysses should not sail directly home; if he had, there had been no room for the relation of his own adventures, and all those surprizing narrations he makes to the Phæacians: Homer therefore to bring about the shipwreck of Ulysses, withdraws the Gods. In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find, Alone, and floating to the wave and wind. The word in the original is ???????; ????, as Eustathius observes, is understood: It signifies, continues he, a small vessel made of one entire piece of wood, or a vessel about which little wood is used; it is deriv'd from ??????, from being ??????????? ???????????, or its being compacted together with ease. Hesychius defines ?????? to be, ????? ???? ? ???? ? ?????????, ??? ???? ???????: that is, a small bark, or float of wood which sailors bind together, and immediately use in navigation. This observation appear'd to me very necessary, to take off an objection made upon a following passage in this book: the Critics have thought it incredible that Ulysses should without any assistance build such a vessel, as Homer describes; but if we remember what kind of a vessel it is, it may be reconcil'd to probability. The bold Phæacians, there, whose haughty line The Phæacians were the inhabitants of Scheria, sometimes call'd Drepanè, afterwards Corcyra, now Corfu, in the possession of the Venetians. But it may be ask'd in what these people resemble the Gods? they are describ'd as a most effeminate nation: whence then this God-like Quality? Eustathius answers, that is either from their undisturb'd felicity, or from their divine quality of general benevolence: he prefers the latter; but from the general character of the Phæacians, I should prefer the former. Homer frequently describes the Gods as ??? ???? ???????, the Gods that live in endless ease: This is suitable to the Phæacians, as will appear more fully in the sequel of the Odyssey. Eustathius remarks, that the Poet here gives us in a few lines the heads of the eight succeeding books; and sure nothing can be a greater instance of Homer's art, than his building so noble an edifice upon so small a foundation: The plan is simple and unadorn'd, but he embellishes it with all the beauties in nature. Is mixt with Gods, half human, half divine, The chief shall honour as some heav'nly guest, And swift transport him to his place of rest. His vessels loaded with a plenteous store Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent Ore; (A richer prize than if his joyful Isle Receiv'd him charg'd with Ilion's noble spoil) His friends, his country he shall see, tho' late; Such is our sov'reign Will, and such is Fate. He spoke. The God who mounts the winged winds This is a noble description of Mercury; the verses are lofty and sonorous. Virgil has inserted them in his Æneis, lib. 4. 240. ? pedibus talaxia nectit Aurea: quæ sublimem alis, sive æquora supra, Seu terram, rapido pariter cum flamine portant. Tum virgam capit: hâc animas ille evocat Orco Pallentes, alias sub tristia Tartara mittit; Dat somnos adimitque, &amp; lumina morte resignat. What is here said of the rod of Mercury, is, as Eustathius observes, an Allegory: It is intended to shew the force of eloquence, which has a power to calm, or excite, to raise a passion, or compose it: Mercury is the God of Eloquence, and he may very properly be said ???????, ??? ????????, to cool or inflame the passions, according to the allegorical sense of these expressions. Fast to his feet his golden pinions binds, That high thro' fields of air his flight sustain O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main. He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly, Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye: Then shoots from heav'n to high Pieria's steep, And stoops incumbent on the rolling deep. So wat'ry fowl, that seek their fishy food, Eustathius remarks, that this is a very just allusion; had the Poet compar'd Mercury to an Eagle, tho' the comparison had been more noble, yet it had been less proper; a sea-fowl most properly represents the passage of a Deity over the seas; the comparison being adapted to the element. Some ancient Critics mark'd the last verse ?? ??????, &amp;c. with an Obelisk, a sign that it ought to be rejected: They thought that the word ??????? did not sufficiently express the swiftness of the flight of Mercury; the word implies no more than he was carry'd: But this expression is applicable to any degree of swiftness; for where is the impropriety, if we say, Mercury was borne along the seas with the utmost rapidity? The word is most properly apply'd to a chariot, ??? ????, ? ????? ???????. Eustathius. With wings expanded o'er the foaming flood, Now sailing smooth the level surface sweep, Now dip their pinions in the briny deep. Thus o'er the world of waters Hermes flew, 'Till now the distant Island rose in view: Then swift ascending from the azure wave, He took the path that winded to the cave. Large was the Grot, in which the nymph he found, Homer here introduces an Episode of Calypso: and as every Incident ought to have some relation to the main design of the Poem, it may be ask'd what relation this bears to the other parts of it? A very essential one: The sufferings of Ulysses are the subject of the Odyssey; here we find him inclos'd in an Island: all his calamities arise from his absence from his own country: Calypso then who detains him is the cause of all his calamities. It is with great judgment that the Poet feigns him to be restrain'd by a Deity, rather than a mortal. It might have appear'd somewhat derogatory from the prudence and courage of Ulysses, not to have been able by art or strength to have freed himself from the power of a mortal: but by this conduct the Poet at once excuses his Heroe, and aggravates his misfortunes: he is detain'd involuntarily, but it is a Goddess who detains him, and it is no disgrace for a man not to be able to over-power a Deity. Bossu observes, that the art of Disguise is part of the character of Ulysses: Now this is imply'd in the name of Calypso, which signifies concealment, or secret. The Poet makes his Heroe stay seven whole years with this Goddess; she taught him so well, that he afterwards lost no opportunities of putting her instructions in practice, and does nothing without disguise. Virgil has borrow'd part of his description of Circe in the 7?? book of the Æneis, from this of Calypso. ? ubi Solis filia lucos Assiduo resonat cantu, tectisque superbis Urit odoratam nocturna in lumina cedrum, Arguto tenues percurrens pectine telas. What I have here said shews likewise the necessity of this machine of Mercury: It is an establish'd rule of Horace, Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus Inciderit: ? Calypso was a Goddess, and consequently all human means were insufficient to deliver Ulysses. There was therefore a necessity to have recourse to the Gods. (The fair-hair'd nymph with ev'ry beauty crown'd) She sate and sung; the rocks resound her lays: The cave was brighten'd with a rising blaze: Cedar and frankincense, an od'rous pile, Flam'd on the hearth, and wide perfum'd the Isle; While she with work and song the time divides, And thro' the loom the golden shuttle guides, Without the grot, a various sylvan scene It is impossible for a Painter to draw a more admirable rural Landskip: The bower of Calypso is the principal figure, surrounded with a shade of different trees: Green meadows adorn'd with flowers, beautiful fountains, and vines loaded with clusters of grapes, and birds hovering in the air, are seen in the liveliest colours in Homer's Poetry. But whoever observes the particular trees, plants, birds, &amp;c. will find another beauty of propriety in this description, every part being adapted, and the whole scene drawn, agreeable to a country situate by the sea. Appear'd around, and groves of living green; Poplars and alders ever quiv'ring play'd, And nodding cypress form'd a fragrant shade; On whose high branches, waving with the storm, The birds of broadest wing their mansion form, The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow, And scream aloft, and skim the deeps below. Depending vines the shelving cavern screen, Eustathius endeavours to fix the season of the year when Ulysses departed from that Island; he concludes it to be in the latter end of Autumn, or the beginning of Winter; for Calypso is describ'd as making use of a fire, so is Arete in the sixth book, and Eumæus and Ulysses in other parts of the Odyssey. This gives us reason to conclude, that the Summer heats were past; and what makes it still more probable is, that a Vine is in this place said to be loaded with grapes, which plainly confines the season of the year to the Autumn. With purple clusters blushing thro' the green. Four limpid fountains from the clefts distill, And ev'ry fountain pours a sev'ral rill, In mazy windings wand'ring down the hill: Where bloomy meads with virid greens were crown'd, And glowing violets threw odors round. A scene, where if a God shou'd cast his sight, A God might gaze, and wander with delight! Joy touch'd the messenger of heav'n: he stay'd Entranc'd, and all the blissful haunt survey'd. Him, ent'ring in the cave, Calypso knew, For pow'rs celestial to each other's view Stand still confest, tho' distant far they lie Or habitants of earth, or sea, or sky. But sad Ulysses by himself apart, Eustathius imagines, that the Poet describes Ulysses absent from Calypso, to the end that Calypso might lay a seeming obligation upon Ulysses, by appearing to dismiss him voluntarily: for Ulysses being absent, could not know that Mercury had commanded his departure; so that this favour appears to proceed from the sole kindness of the Goddess. Dacier dislikes this observation, and shews that decency requires the absence of Ulysses; if the Poet had describ'd him in the company of Calypso, it might have given suspicion of an amorous disposition, and he might seem content with his absence from his country: but the very nature of the Poem requires that he should be continually endeavouring to return to it: The Poet therefore with great judgment describes him agreeably to his character, his mind is entirely taken up with his misfortunes, and neglecting all the pleasures which a Goddess could confer, he entertains himself with his own melancholy reflections, sitting in solitude upon the sea-shores. Pour'd the big sorrows of his swelling heart; All on the lonely shore he sate to weep, And roll'd his eyes around the restless deep; Tow'rd his lov'd coast he roll'd his eyes in vain, 'Till dimm'd with rising grief, they stream'd again. Now graceful seated on her shining throne, To Hermes thus the nymph divine begun. God of the golden wand! on what behest Arriv'st thou here, an unexpected guest? Lov'd as thou art, thy free injunctions lay; 'Tis mine, with joy and duty to obey. 'Till now a stranger, in a happy hour Approach, and taste the dainties of my bow'r. Thus having spoke, the nymph the table spread, (Ambrosial cates, with Nectar rosie red) Hermes the hospitable rite partook, Divine refection! then recruited, spoke. What mov'd this journey from my native sky, A Goddess asks, nor can a God deny: Hear then the truth. By mighty Jove's command Unwilling, have I trod this pleasing land; For who, self-mov'd, with weary wing wou'd sweep Such length of ocean and unmeasur'd deep? A world of waters! far from all the ways Where men frequent, or sacred altars blaze. But to Jove's will submission we must pay; What pow'r so great, to dare to disobey? A man, he says, a man resides with thee, Of all his kind most worn with misery: The Greeks, (whose arms for nine long years employ'd Their force on Ilion, in the tenth destroy'd) At length embarking in a luckless hour, With conquest proud, incens'd Minerva's pow'r: Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurl'd With storms pursu'd them thro' the liquid world. There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave! There all his dear companions found their grave! Sav'd from the jaws of death by heav'n's decree, The tempest drove him to these shores and thee. Him, Jove now orders to his native lands Strait to dismiss: so Destiny commands: Impatient Fate his near return attends, And calls him to his country, and his friends. Ev'n to her inmost soul the Goddess shook; Then thus her anguish and her passion broke. Ungracious Gods! with spite and envy curst! Still to your own ætherial race the worst! Ye envy mortal and immortal joy, And love, the only sweet of life, destroy, Did ever Goddess by her charms ingage A favour'd mortal, and not feel your rage? So when Aurora sought Orion's love, The love of Calypso to Ulysses might seem too bold a fiction, and contrary to all credibility, Ulysses being a mortal, she a Goddess: Homer therefore to soften the relation, brings in instances of the like passion, in Orion and Iäsion; and by this he fully justifies his own conduct, the Poet being at liberty to make use of any prevailing story, tho' it were all fable and fiction. But why should the death of Orion be here ascrib'd to Diana; whereas in other places, she is said to exercise her power only over Women? The reason is, she slew him for offering violence to her chastity; for tho' Homer be silent about his crime, yet Horace relates it ? Integræ Tentator Orion Dianæ Virgineâ domitus sagittâ. Eustathius gives another reason why Aurora is said to be in love with Orion. He was a great hunter, as appears from the eleventh book of the Odyssey; and the morning or Aurora is most favourable to those diversions. Her joys disturb'd your blissful hours above, 'Till in Ortygia, Dian's winged dart Had pierc'd the hapless hunter to the heart. So when the covert of the thrice-ear'd field Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield, Scarce could Iäsion taste her heav'nly charms, Ceres is here understood allegorically, to signify the earth; Iäsion was a great Husbandman, and consequently Ceres may easily be feign'd to be in love with him: The thunderbolt with which he is slain signifies the excess of heat, which frequently disappoints the hopes of the labourer. Eustathius. But Jove's swift lightning scorch'd him in her arms. And is it now my turn, ye mighty pow'rs! Am I the envy of your blissful bow'rs? A man, an outcast to the storm and wave, Homer in this speech of Calypso shews very naturally how passion misguides the understanding. She views her own cause in the most advantageous, but false light, and thence concludes that Jupiter offers a piece of injustice in commanding the departure of Ulysses: She tells Mercury, that it is she who had preserv'd his life, who had entertain'd him with affection, and offer'd him immortality; and would Jupiter thus repay her tenderness to Ulysses? Would Jupiter force him from a place where nothing was wanting to his happiness, and expose him again to the like dangers from which she had preserv'd him? this was an act of cruelty. But on the contrary, she speaks not one word concerning the truth of the cause: viz. that she offer'd violence to the inclinations of Ulysses; that she made him miserable by detaining him, not only from his wife, but from his whole dominions; and never considers that Jupiter is just in delivering him from his captivity. This is a very lively, tho' unhappy picture of human nature, which is too apt to fall into error, and then endeavours to justify an error by a seeming reason. Dacier. It was my crime to pity, and to save; When he who thunders rent his bark in twain, And sunk his brave companions in the main. Alone, abandon'd, in mid ocean tost, The sport of winds, and driv'n from ev'ry coast, Hither this Man of miseries I led, Receiv'd the friendless, and the hungry fed; Nay promis'd (vainly promis'd!) to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe. 'Tis past—and Jove decrees he shall remove; Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove. Go then he may (he must, if He ordain) Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again. But never, never shall Calypso send To toils like these, her husband, and her friend, What ships have I, what sailors to convey, What oars to cut the long laborious way? Yet, I'll direct the safest means to go: That last advice is all I can bestow. To her, the Pow'r who bears the charming rod. Dismiss the Man, nor irritate the God; Prevent the rage of him who reigns above, For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove? Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky, And in a moment vanish'd from her eye. The Nymph, obedient to divine command, To seek Ulysses, pac'd along the sand. Him pensive on the lonely beach she found, With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown'd, And inly pining for his native shore; For now the soft Enchantress pleas'd no more: For now, reluctant, and constrain'd by charms, Absent he lay in her desiring arms, This passage has fallen under the severe censure of the Critics, they condemn it as an act of conjugal infidelity, and a breach of Morality in Ulysses: It would be sufficient to answer, that a Poet is not oblig'd to draw a perfect character in the person of his Heroe: perfection is not to be found in human life, and consequently ought not to be ascribed to it in Poetry: Neither Achilles nor Æneas are perfect characters: Æneas in particular is as guilty, with respect to Dido, in the desertion of her, (for Virgil tells us they were married, connubio jungam stabili) as Ulysses can be imagin'd to be by the most severe Critic, with respect to Calypso. But those who have blam'd this passage, form their judgments from the morality of these ages, and not from the Theology of the Ancients: Polygamy was then allow'd, and even Concubinage, without being esteem'd any breach of conjugal fidelity: If this be not admitted, the heathen Gods are as guilty as the heathen Heroes, and Jupiter and Ulysses are equally criminals. This very passage shews the sincere affection which Ulysses retain'd for his wife Penelope; even a Goddess cannot persuade him to forget her; his person is in the power of Calypso, but his heart is with Penelope. Tully had this book of Homer in his thought when he said of Ulysses, Vetulam suam prætulit immortalitati. In slumber wore the heavy night away, On rocks and shores consum'd the tedious day; There sate all desolate, and sigh'd alone, With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan, And roll'd his eyes o'er all the restless main, 'Till dimm'd with rising grief, they stream'd again. Here, on his musing mood the Goddess prest, Approaching soft; and thus the chief addrest. Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey, No more in sorrows languish life away: Free as the winds I give thee now to rove— Go, fell the timber of yon' lofty grove, And form a Raft, and build the rising ship, Sublime to bear thee o'er the gloomy deep. To store the vessel let the care be mine, With water from the rock, and rosie wine, And life-sustaining bread, and fair array, And prosp'rous gales to waft thee on thy way. These, if the Gods with my desires comply, (The Gods alas more mighty far than I, And better skill'd in dark events to come) In peace shall land thee at thy native home. With sighs, Ulysses heard the words she spoke, Then thus his melancholy silence broke. It may be ask'd what occasions this conduct in Ulysses? he has long been desirous to return to his country, why then is he melancholy at the proposal of it? This proceeds from his apprehensions of insincerity in Calypso: he had long been unable to obtain his dismission with the most urgent entreaties; this voluntary kindness therefore seems suspicious. He is ignorant that Jupiter had commanded his departure, and therefore fears lest his obstinate desire of leaving her should have provoked her to destroy him, under a shew of complying with his inclinations. This is an instance that Ulysses is not only wise in extricating himself from difficulties, but cautious in guarding against dangers. Some other motive, Goddess! sways thy mind, (Some close design, or turn of womankind) Nor my return the end, nor this the way, On a slight Raft to pass the swelling sea Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails The best-built ship, tho' Jove inspire the gales. The bold proposal how shall I fulfill? Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will. Swear then, thou mean'st not what my soul forebodes; Swear, by the solemn oath that binds the Gods. Him, while he spoke, with smiles Calypso ey'd, And gently grasp'd his hand, and thus reply'd. This shews thee, friend, by old experience taught, And learn'd in all the wiles of human thought. How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise? But hear, oh earth, and hear, ye sacred skies! The oath of Calypso is introduc'd with the utmost solemnity. Rapine allows it to be an instance of true sublimity. The Ancients attested all nature in their oaths, that all nature might conspire to punish their perjuries. Virgil has imitated this passage, but has not copy'd the full beauty of the original. Esto nunc sol testis, &amp; hæc mihi terra precanti. It is the remark of Grotius, that the like expression is found in Deuteronomy, Hear, oh ye heavens, the words that I speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. Which may almost literally be render'd by this verse of Homer. ???? ?=? ???? ????, ??? ??????? ????? ???????. And thou, oh Styx! whose formidable floods Glide thro' the shades, and bind th'attesting Gods! No form'd design, no meditated end Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend; Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim; The same my practice, were my fate the same. Heav'n has not curst me with a heart of steel, But giv'n the sense, to pity, and to feel. Thus having said, the Goddess march'd before: He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore. At the cool cave arriv'd, they took their state; He fill'd the throne where Mercury had sate, For him, the Nymph a rich repast ordains, The Passion of Love is no where describ'd in all Homer, but in this passage between Calypso and Ulysses; and we find that the Poet is not unsuccessful in drawing the tender, as well as the fiercer passions. This seemingly-trifling circumstance is an instance of it; love delights to oblige, and the least offices receive a value from the person who performs them: This is the reason why Calypso serves Ulysses with her own hands; her Damsels attend her, but love make it a pleasure to her to attend Ulysses. Eustathius. Calypso shews more fondness for Ulysses, than Ulysses for Calypso: Indeed Ulysses had been no less than seven years in the favour of that Goddess; it was a kind of matrimony, and husbands are not altogether so fond as lovers. But the true reason is, a more tender behaviour had been contrary to the character of Ulysses; it is necessary that his stay should be by constraint, that he should continually be endeavouring to return to his own country; and consequently to have discover'd too great a degree of satisfaction in any thing during his absence, had outrag'd his character. His return is the main hinge upon which the whole Odyssey turns, and therefore no pleasure, not even a Goddess, ought to divert him from it. Such as the mortal life of man sustains: Before herself were plac'd the cates divine, Ambrosial banquet, and celestial wine. Their hunger satiate, and their thirst represt, Thus spoke Calypso to her god-like guest.) Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began) Oh sprung from Gods! in wisdom more than man. Is then thy home the passion of thy heart? Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part? Farewel! and ever joyful may'st thou be, Nor break the transport with one thought of me. But ah Ulysses! wert thou giv'n to know This is another instance of the tyranny of the passion of love: Calypso had receiv'd a command to dismiss Ulysses; Mercury had laid before her the fatal consequences of her refusal, and she had promis'd to send him away; but her Love here again prevails over her reason; she frames excuses still to detain him, and though she dares not keep him, she knows not how to part with him. This is a true picture of nature; Love this moment resolves, the next breaks these resolutions: She had promis'd to obey Jupiter, in not detaining Ulysses; but she endeavours to persuade Ulysses not to go away. What fate yet dooms thee, yet, to undergo; Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease, And ev'n these slighted charms might learn to please. A willing Goddess, and immortal life, Might banish from thy mind an absent wife. Am I inferior to a mortal dame? Less soft my feature, less august my frame? Or shall the daughters of mankind compare Their earth-born beauties with the heav'nly fair? Alas! for this (the prudent man replies) Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise? Lov'd and ador'd, oh Goddess, as thou art, Forgive the weakness of a human heart. Tho' well I see thy graces far above Ulysses shews great address in this answer to Calypso; he softens the severity of it, by first asking a favourable acceptance of what he is about to say; he calls her his ador'd Goddess, and places Penelope in every degree below the perfections of Calypso. As it is the nature of woman not to endure a rival, Ulysses assigns the desire of his return to another cause than the love of Penelope, and ascribes it solely to the love he bears his country. Eustathius. The dear, tho' mortal, object of my love, Of youth eternal well the diff'rence know, And the short date of fading charms below; Yet ev'ry day, while absent thus I roam, I languish to return, and dye at home. Whate'er the Gods shall destine me to bear In the black ocean, or the wat'ry war, 'Tis mine to master with a constant mind; Enur'd to perils, to the worst resign'd. By seas, by wars, so many dangers run, Still I can suffer; Their high will be done! Thus while he spoke, the beamy Sun descends, And rising night her friendly shade extends. To the close grot the lonely pair remove, And slept delighted with the gifts of love. When rosy morning call'd them from their rest, Ulysses robe'd him in the cloak and vest. The nymph's fair head a veil transparent grac'd, Her swelling loins a radiant Zone embrac'd With flow'rs of gold, an under robe, unbound, In snowy waves flow'd glitt'ring on the ground. Forth-issuing thus, she gave him first to wield A weighty axe, with truest temper steel'd, And double-edg'd; the handle smooth and plain, Wrought of the clouded olive's easy grain; And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway: Then to the neighb'ring forest led the way. On the lone Island's utmost verge there stood Of poplars, pines, and firs, a lofty wood, Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire, Scorch'd by the sun, or sear'd by heav'nly fire: (Already dry'd.) These pointing out to view, The Nymph just shew'd him, and with tears withdrew. Now toils the Heroe; trees on trees o'erthrown This passage has fallen under censure, as outraging all probability: Rapine believes it to be impossible for one man alone to build so compleat a vessel in the compass of four days; and perhaps the same opinion might lead Bossu into a mistake, who allows twenty days to Ulysses in building it; he applies the word ??????, or twenty, to the days, which ought to be apply'd to the trees; ??????? is understood, for the Poet immediately after declares that the whole was compleated in the space of four days; neither is there any thing incredible in the description. I have observ'd already that this vessel is but ??????, a Float, or Raft; 'tis true, Ulysses cuts down twenty trees to build it; this may seem too great a provision of materials for so small an undertaking: But why should we imagine these to be large trees? the description plainly shews the contrary, for it had been impossible to have fell'd twenty large trees in the space of four days, much more to have built a vessel proportionable to such materials: but the vessel was but small, and consequently such were the trees. Homer calls these dry trees; this is not inserted without reason, for green wood is unfit for Navigation. Homer in this passage shews his skill in Mechanics; a shipwright could not have describ'd a vessel more exactly: but what is chiefly valuable, is the insight it gives us to what degree this art of shipbuilding was then arriv'd: We find likewise what use Navigators made of Astronomy in those ages; so that this passage deserves a double regard, as a fine piece of Poetry, and a valuable remain of Antiquity. Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan: Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow'd, And lopp'd, and lighten'd of their branchy load. At equal angles these dispos'd to join, He smooth'd, and squar'd 'em, by the rule and line. (The wimbles for the work Calypso found) It is remarkable, that Calypso brings the tools to Ulysses at several times: this is another instance of the nature of Love; it seeks opportunities to be in the company of the belov'd person. Calypso is an instance of it: she frequently goes away, and frequently returns; she delays the time, by not bringing all the implements at once to Ulysses; so that tho' she cannot divert him from his resolutions of leaving her, yet she protracts his stay. It may be necessary to make some observations in general upon this passage of Calypso and Ulysses. Mr. Dryden has been very severe upon it. “What are the tears, says he, of Calypso for being left, to the fury and death of Dido? Where is there the whole process of her passion, and all its violent effects to be found, in the languishing Episode of the Odysses?” Much may be said in vindication of Homer; there is a wide difference between the characters of Dido and Calypso, Calypso is a Goddess, and consequently not liable to the same passions, as an enrag'd woman: yet disappointed love being always an outrageous passion, Homer makes her break out into blasphemies against Jupiter and all the Gods. “But the same process of love is not found in Homer as in Virgil;” 'Tis true, and Homer had been very injudicious if he had inserted it. The time allows it not; it was necessary for Homer to describe the conclusion of Calypso's passion, not the beginning or process of it. It was necessary to carry on the main design of the Poem, viz. the Departure of Ulysses, in order to his re-establishment; and not amuse the Reader with the detail of a passion that was so far from contributing to the end of the Poem, that it was the greatest impediment to it. If the Poet had found an enlargement necessary to his design, had he attempted a full description of the passion, and then fail'd, Mr. Dryden's Criticism had been judicious. Virgil had a fair opportunity to expatiate, nay the occasion requir'd it, inasmuch as the love of Dido contributed to the design of the Poem; it brought about her assistance to Æneas, and the preservation of his companions: and consequently the copiousness of Virgil is as judicious as the conciseness of Homer. I allow Virgil's to be a masterpiece; perhaps no images are more happily drawn in all that Poet; but the passages in the two Authors are not similar, and consequently admit of no comparison: Would it not have been insufferable in Homer, to have stepp'd seven years backward, to describe the process of Calypso's passion, when the very nature of the Poem requires that Ulysses should immediately return to his own country? ought the action to be suspended for a fine description? But an opposite conduct was judicious in both the Poets, and therefore Virgil is commendable for giving us the whole process of a love-passion in Dido, Homer for only relating the conclusion of it in Calypso. I will only add that Virgil has borrow'd his Machinery from Homer, and that the departure of Æneas and Ulysses is brought about by the command of Jupiter, and the descent of Mercury. With those he pierc'd 'em, and with clinchers bound. Long and capacious as a shipwright forms Some bark's broad bottom to out-ride the storms, So large he built the Raft: then ribb'd it strong From space to space, and nail'd the planks along; These form'd the sides: the deck he fashion'd last; Then o'er the vessel rais'd the taper mast, With crossing sail-yards dancing in the wind; And to the helm the guiding rudder join'd. (With yielding osiers fenc'd, to break the force Of surging waves, and steer the steady course) Thy loom, Calypso! for the future sails It is remarkable, that Calypso brings the tools to Ulysses at several times: this is another instance of the nature of Love; it seeks opportunities to be in the company of the belov'd person. Calypso is an instance of it: she frequently goes away, and frequently returns; she delays the time, by not bringing all the implements at once to Ulysses; so that tho' she cannot divert him from his resolutions of leaving her, yet she protracts his stay. It may be necessary to make some observations in general upon this passage of Calypso and Ulysses. Mr. Dryden has been very severe upon it. “What are the tears, says he, of Calypso for being left, to the fury and death of Dido? Where is there the whole process of her passion, and all its violent effects to be found, in the languishing Episode of the Odysses?” Much may be said in vindication of Homer; there is a wide difference between the characters of Dido and Calypso, Calypso is a Goddess, and consequently not liable to the same passions, as an enrag'd woman: yet disappointed love being always an outrageous passion, Homer makes her break out into blasphemies against Jupiter and all the Gods. “But the same process of love is not found in Homer as in Virgil;” 'Tis true, and Homer had been very injudicious if he had inserted it. The time allows it not; it was necessary for Homer to describe the conclusion of Calypso's passion, not the beginning or process of it. It was necessary to carry on the main design of the Poem, viz. the Departure of Ulysses, in order to his re-establishment; and not amuse the Reader with the detail of a passion that was so far from contributing to the end of the Poem, that it was the greatest impediment to it. If the Poet had found an enlargement necessary to his design, had he attempted a full description of the passion, and then fail'd, Mr. Dryden's Criticism had been judicious. Virgil had a fair opportunity to expatiate, nay the occasion requir'd it, inasmuch as the love of Dido contributed to the design of the Poem; it brought about her assistance to Æneas, and the preservation of his companions: and consequently the copiousness of Virgil is as judicious as the conciseness of Homer. I allow Virgil's to be a masterpiece; perhaps no images are more happily drawn in all that Poet; but the passages in the two Authors are not similar, and consequently admit of no comparison: Would it not have been insufferable in Homer, to have stepp'd seven years backward, to describe the process of Calypso's passion, when the very nature of the Poem requires that Ulysses should immediately return to his own country? ought the action to be suspended for a fine description? But an opposite conduct was judicious in both the Poets, and therefore Virgil is commendable for giving us the whole process of a love-passion in Dido, Homer for only relating the conclusion of it in Calypso. I will only add that Virgil has borrow'd his Machinery from Homer, and that the departure of Æneas and Ulysses is brought about by the command of Jupiter, and the descent of Mercury. Supply'd the cloth, capacious of the gales. With stays and cordage last he rigg'd the ship, And roll'd on leavers, launch'd her in the deep. Four days were past, and now the work compleat Shone the fifth morn: when from her sacred seat The nymph dismist him, (od'rous garments giv'n) And bath'd in fragrant oils that breath'd of heav'n) Then fill'd two goat-skins with her hands divine, With water one, and one with sable wine; Of ev'ry kind provisions heav'd aboard, And the full decks with copious viands stor'd. The Goddess last a gentle breeze supplies, To curl old Ocean, and to warm the skies. And now, rejoycing in the prosp'rous gales, With beating heart Ulysses spreads his sails; It is observable that the Poet passes over the parting of Calypso and Ulysses in silence; he leaves it to be imagin'd by the Reader, and prosecutes his main action. Nothing but a cold compliment could have proceeded from Ulysses, he being overjoy'd at the prospect of returning to his country: it was therefore judicious in Homer to omit the relation; and not draw Calypso in tears, and Ulysses in a transport of joy. Besides, it was necessary to shorten the Episode: the commands of Jupiter were immediately to be obey'd; and the story being now turn'd to Ulysses, it was requisite to put him immediately upon action, and describe him endeavouring to re-establish his own affairs, which is the whole design of the Odyssey. Plac'd at the helm he sate, and mark'd the skies, Nor clos'd in sleep his ever-watchful eyes. There view'd the Pleiads, and the northern Team, And great Orion's more refulgent beam, To which, around the axle of the sky The Bear revolving, points his golden eye; Who shines exalted on th'etherial plain, Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main. Far on the left those radiant fires to keep The Nymph directed, as he sail'd the deep. Full sev'nteen nights he cut the foamy way; It may seem incredible that one person should be able to manage a vessel seventeen days without any assistance; but Eustathius vindicates Homer by an instance that very much resembles this of Ulysses. A certain Pamphylian being taken prisoner, and carried to Tamiathis (afterwards Damietta) in Ægypt, continued there several years; but being continually desirous to return to his country, he pretends a skill in sea affairs; this succeeds, and he is immediately employ'd in Maritime business, and permitted the liberty to follow it according to his own inclination, without any inspection. He made use of this opportunity, and furnishing himself with a sail, and provisions for a long voyage, committed himself to the sea all alone; he cross'd that vast extent of waters that lies between Ægypt and Pamphylia, and arriv'd safely in his own country: In memory of this prodigious event he chang'd his name, and was called ??????????, or the sole-sailor; and the family was not extinct in the days of Eustathius. It may not be improper to observe, that this description of Ulysses sailing alone is a demonstration of the smallness of his vessel; for it is impossible that a large one could be managed by a single person. It is indeed said that twenty trees were taken down for the vessel, but this does not imply that all the trees were made use of, but only so much of them as was necessary to his purpose. The distant land appear'd the following day: Then swell'd to sight Phæacia's dusky coast, And woody mountains, half in vapours lost; That lay before him, indistinct and vast, Like a broad shield amid the watry waste. This expression gives a very lively idea of an Island of small extent, that is, of a form more long than large: Aristarchus, instead of ?????, writes ??????, or resembling a Fig; others tell us, that ????? is used by the Illyrians to signify ?????, or a Mist; this likewise very well represents the first appearance of land to those that sail at a distance: it appears indistinct and confus'd, or as it is here express'd, like a Mist. Eustathius. But him, thus voyaging the deeps below, From far, on Solymé's aerial brow, There is some difficulty in this passage. Strabo, as Eustathius observes, affirms that the expression of Neptune's seeing Ulysses from the mountains of Solymé, is to be taken in a general sense, and not to denote the Solymæan mountains in Pisidia; but other eastern mountains that bear the same appellation. In propriety, the Solymæans inhabit the summits of mount Taurus, from Lycia even to Pisidia; these were very distant from the passage of Neptune from the Æthiopians, and consequently could not be the mountains intended by Homer; we must therefore have recourse to the preceding assertion of Strabo, for a solution of the difficulty. Dacier endeavours to explain it another way: Who knows, says she, but that the name of Solymæan was antiently extended to all very elevated mountains? Bochart affirms, that the word Solymi is deriv'd from the Hebrew Selem, or Darkness; why then might not this be a general appellation? But this is all conjecture, and it is much more probable that such a name should be given to some mountains by way of distinction and emphatically, from some peculiar and extraordinary quality; than extend it to all very lofty mountains, which could only introduce confusion and error. The King of Ocean saw, and seeing burn'd, (From Æthiopia's happy climes return'd) The raging Monarch shook his azure head, And thus in secret to his soul he said. Heav'ns! how uncertain are the Pow'rs on high? Is then revers'd the sentence of the sky, In one man's favour? while a distant guest I shar'd secure the Æthiopian feast. Behold how near Phæacia's land he draws! The land, affix'd by Fate's eternal laws To end his toils. Is then our anger vain? No, if this sceptre yet commands the main. He spoke, and high the forky Trident hurl'd, Rolls clouds on clouds, and stirs the wat'ry world, At once the face of earth and sea deforms, Swells all the winds, and rouzes all the storms. Down rush'd the night. East, west, together roar, And south, and north, roll mountains to the shore, Then shook the Heroe, to despair resign'd, And question'd thus his yet-unconquer'd mind. Wretch that I am! what farther Fates attend This life of toils, and what my destin'd end? Too well alas! the island Goddess knew, On the black sea what perils shou'd ensue. New horrors now this destin'd head enclose; Unfill'd is yet the measure of my woes. With what a cloud the brows of heav'n are crown'd? What raging winds? what roaring waters round? 'Tis Jove himself the swelling tempest rears; Death, present death on ev'ry side appears. Happy! thrice happy! who in battle slain Plutarch in his Symposiacs relates a memorable story concerning Memmius, the Roman General: When he had sack'd the City Corinth, and made slaves of those who surviv'd the ruin of it, he commanded one of the youths of a liberal education to write down some sentence in his presence, according to his own inclinations. The youth immediately wrote this passage from Homer. Happy! thrice happy! who in battle slain, Prest in Atrides' cause the Trojan plain. Memmius immediately burst into tears, and gave the youth and all his relations their liberty. Virgil has translated this passage in the first book of his Æneis. The storm, and the behaviour of Æneas, are copy'd exactly from it. The storm, in both the Poets, is describ'd concisely, but the images are full of terror; Homer leads the way, and Virgil treads in his steps without any deviation. Ulysses falls into lamentation, so does Æneas: Ulysses wishes he had found a nobler death, so does Æneas: this discovers a bravery of spirit, they lament not that they are to die, but only the inglorious manner of it. This fully answers an objection that has been made both against Homer and Virgil, who have been blam'd for describing their Heroes with such an air of mean-spiritedness. Drowning was esteem'd by the Ancients an accursed death, as it depriv'd their bodies of the rites of Sepulture; it is therefore no wonder that this kind of death was greatly dreaded, since it barr'd their entrance into the happy regions of the dead for many hundreds of years. Prest in Atrides' cause the Trojan plain: Oh! had I dy'd before that well-fought wall, Had some distinguish'd day renown'd my fall; (Such as was that, when show'rs of jav'lins fled These words have relation to an Action, no where describ'd in the Iliad or Odyssey. When Achilles was slain by the treachery of Paris, the Trojans made a sally to gain his body, but Ulysses carried it off upon his shoulders, while Ajax protected him with his shield. The war of Troy is not the subject of the Iliad, and therefore Homer relates not the death of Achilles; but, as Longinus remarks, he inserts many Actions in the Odyssey which are the sequel of the story of the Iliad. This conduct has a very happy effect; he aggrandizes the character of Ulysses by these short histories, and has found out the way to make him praise himself, without vanity. From conqu'ring Troy around Achilles dead) All Greece had paid my solemn fun'rals then, And spread my glory with the sons of men. A shameful fate now hides my hapless head, Un-wept, un-noted, and for ever dead! A mighty wave rush'd o'er him as he spoke, The Raft it cover'd, and the mast it broke; Swept from the deck, and from the rudder torn, Far on the swelling surge the chief was born: While by the howling tempest rent in twain Flew sail and sail-yards ratling o'er the main. Long press'd he heav'd beneath the weighty wave, Clogg'd by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave: At length emerging, from his nostrils wide And gushing mouth, effus'd the briny tyde. Ev'n then, not mindless of his last retreat, He seiz'd the Raft, and leapt into his seat, Strong with the fear of death. The rolling flood Now here, now there, impell'd the floating wood. As when a heap of gather'd thorns is cast Now to, now fro, before th'autumnal blast; Together clung, it rolls around the field; So roll'd the Float, and so its texture held: And now the south, and now the north, bear sway, And now the east the foamy floods obey, And now the west-wind whirls it o'er the sea. The wand'ring Chief, with toils on toils opprest, It is not probable that Ulysses could escape so great a danger by his own strength alone; and therefore the Poet introduces Leucothea to assist in his preservation. But it may be ask'd, if this is not contradictory to the command of Jupiter in the beginning of this book? Ulysses is there forbid all assistance either from men or Gods; whence then is it that Leucothea preserves him? The former passage is to be understood to imply an interdiction only of all assistance 'till Ulysses was shipwreck'd; he was to suffer, not to die: Thus Pallas afterwards calms the storm; she may be imagin'd to have a power over the winds, as she is the daughter of Jupiter, who denotes the Air, according to the observation of Eustathius: Here Leucothea is very properly introduced to preserve Ulysses; she is a Sea-Goddess, and had been a mortal, and therefore interests her self in the cause of a mortal. Leucothea saw, and pity touch'd her breast: (Herself a mortal once, of Cadmus' strain, But now an azure sister of the main) Swift as a Sea-mew springing from the flood, All radiant on the Raft the Goddess stood: Then thus address'd him. Thou, whom heav'n decrees To Neptune's wrath, stern Tyrant of the Seas, (Unequal contest) not his rage and pow'r, Great as he is, such virtue shall devour. What I suggest thy wisdom will perform; Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm: Strip off thy garments; Neptune's fury brave With naked strength, and plunge into the wave. To reach Phæacia all thy nerves extend, There fate decrees thy miseries shall end. This heav'nly Scarf beneath thy bosom bind, This passage may seem extraordinary, and the Poet be thought to preserve Ulysses by incredible means. What virtue could there be in this Scarf against the violence of storms? Eustathius very well answers this objection. It is evident that the belief of the power of Amulets or Charms prevailed in the times of Homer; thus Moly is used by Ulysses as a preservative against Fascination, and some charm may be supposed to be imply'd in the Zone or Cæstus of Venus. Thus Ulysses may be imagin'd to have worn a scarf, or cincture, as a preservative against the perils of the sea. They consecrated antiently Votiva, as tablets, &amp;c. in the temples of their Gods: So Ulysses, wearing a Zone consecrated to Leucothea, may be said to receive it from the hands of that Goddess. Eustathius observes, that Leucothea did not appear in the form of a Bird, for then how should she speak, or how bring this cincture or scarf? The expression has relation only to the manner of her rising out of the sea, and descending into it; the Action, not the Person, is intended to be represented. Thus Minerva is said in the Odyssey, to fly away, ????? ?? ???????, not in the form but with the swiftness of an Eagle. Most of the Translators have render'd this passage ridiculously, they describe her in the real form of a sea-fowl, tho' she speaks, and gives her Scarf. So the version of Hobbs: She spoke, in figure of a Water-hen. And live; give all thy terrors to the wind. Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain, Return the gift, and cast it in the main; Observe my orders, and with heed obey, Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away. With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows, Then down the deeps she div'd from whence she rose: A moment snatch'd the shining form away, And all was cover'd with the curling sea. Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclin'd, He stands suspended, and explores his mind. What shall I do? Unhappy me! who knows But other Gods intend me other woes? Whoe'er thou art, I shall not blindly join Eustathius observes, that this passage is a lesson to instruct us, that second reflections are preferable to our first thoughts; and the Poet maintains the character of Ulysses by describing him thus doubtful and cautious. But is not Ulysses too incredulous, who will not believe a Goddess? and disobedient to her, by not committing himself to the seas? Leucothea does not confine Ulysses to an immediate compliance with her injunctions; she indeed commands him to forsake the Raft, but leaves the Time to his own discretion: And Ulysses might very justly be somewhat incredulous, when he knew that Neptune was his enemy, and contriving his destruction. The doubts therefore of Ulysses are the doubts of a wise man: But then, is not Ulysses describ'd with a greater degree of prudence, than the Goddess? she commands him to leave the Raft, he chuses to make use of it 'till he arrives nearer the shores. Eustathius directly ascribes more wisdom to Ulysses than to Leucothea. This may appear too partial; it is sufficient to observe, that the command of Leucothea was general and left the manner of the execution of it to his own prudence. Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine: For scarce in ken appears that distant Isle Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil. Thus then I judge: while yet the planks sustain The wild waves fury, here I fix'd remain: But when their texture to the tempest yields, I launch advent'rous on the liquid fields, Join to the help of Gods the strength of man, And take this method, since the best I can. While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold, The raging God a wat'ry mountain roll'd; Like a black sheet the whelming billow spread, Burst o'er the float, and thunder'd on his head. Planks, Beams, dis-parted fly: the scatter'd wood Rolls diverse, and in fragments strows the flood. So the rude Boreas, o'er the field new shorn, Tosses and drives the scatter'd heaps of corn. And now a single beam the Chief bestrides; There, pois'd a while above the bounding tydes, His limbs dis-cumbers of the clinging vest, And binds the sacred cincture round his breast: Then prone on Ocean in a moment flung, Stretch'd wide his eager arms, and shot the seas along. All naked now, on heaving billows laid, Stern Neptune ey'd him, and contemptuous said: Go, learn'd in woes, and other woes essay! Go, wander helpless on the wat'ry way: Thus, thus find out the destin'd shore, and then (If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men. Whate'er thy Fate, the ills our wrath could raise Shall last remember'd in thy best of days. This said, his sea-green steeds divide the foam, And reach high Ægæ and the tow'ry dome. Now, scarce withdrawn the fierce Earth-shaking pow'r, Jove's daughter Pallas watch'd the fav'ring hour. Back to their caves she bad the winds to fly, And hush'd the blust'ring brethren of the sky. The dryer blasts alone of Boreas sway, And bear him soft on broken waves away; With gentle force impelling to that shore, Where Fate has destin'd he shall toil no more. And now two nights, and now two days were past, It may be thought incredible that any person should be able to contend so long with a violent storm, and at last survive it: It is allow'd that this could scarce be done by the natural strength of Ulysses; but the Poet has soften'd the narration, by ascribing his preservation to the cincture of Leucothea. The Poet likewise very judiciously removes Neptune, that Ulysses may not appear to be preserv'd against the power of that God; and to reconcile it entirely to credibility, he introduces Pallas, who calms the winds and composes the waves, to make way for his preservation. Since wide he wander'd on the wat'ry waste; Heav'd on the surge with intermitting breath, And hourly panting in the arms of death. The third fair morn now blaz'd upon the main; Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain, The winds were hush'd, the billows scarcely curl'd, And a dead silence still'd the wat'ry world. When lifted on a ridgy wave, he spies The land at distance, and with sharpen'd eyes. As pious children joy with vast delight This is a very beautiful comparison, and well adapted to the occasion. We mistake the intention of it, as Eustathius observes, if we imagine that Homer intended to compare the person of Ulysses to these children: It is introduc'd solely to express the joy which he conceives at the sight of land; if we look upon it in any other view, the resemblance is lost; for the children suffer not themselves, but Ulysses is in the utmost distress. These Images drawn from common life are particularly affecting; they have relation to every man as every man may possibly be in such circumstances: other Images may be more noble, and yet less pleasing; They may raise our admiration, but those engage our affections. When a lov'd Sire revives before their sight, (Who ling'ring long has call'd on death in vain, Fixt by some Dæmon to his bed of pain, It was a prevailing opinion among the Ancients, that the Gods were the authors of all diseases incident to mankind. Hippocrates himself confesses that he had found some distempers, in which the hand of the Gods was manifest, ?????, as Dacier observes. In this place this assertion has a peculiar beauty, it shews that the malady was not contracted by any vice of the father, but inflicted by an evil Dæmon. Nothing is more evident, than that every person was suppos'd by the Ancients to have a good and a bad Dæmon attending him; what the Greeks call'd a Dæmon, the Romans named a Genius. I confess that this is no where directly affirm'd in Homer, but as Plutarch observes, it is plainly intimated. In the second book of the Iliad the word is used both in a good and bad sense; when Ulysses addresses himself to the Generals of the army, he says ????????, in the better sense; and immediately afterwards he uses it to denote a coward, ???????? ??????? ??? This is a strong evidence, that the notion of good and bad Dæmons was believ'd in the days of Homer. 'Till heav'n by miracle his life restore) So joys Ulysses at th'appearing shore; And sees (and labours onward as he sees) The rising forests, and the tufted trees. And now, as near approaching as the sound Of human voice the list'ning ear may wound, Amidst the rocks he hears a hollow roar Of murm'ring surges breaking on the shore: Nor peaceful port was there, nor winding bay, To shield the vessel from the rowling sea; But cliffs, and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight! All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white. Fear seiz'd his slacken'd limbs and beating heart; As thus he commun'd with his soul apart. Ah me! when o'er a length of waters tost, Ulysses in this place calls as it were a council in his own breast; considers his danger, and how to free himself from it. But it may be ask'd if it be probable that he should have leisure for such a consultation, in the time of such imminent danger? The answer is, that nothing could be more happily imagin'd, to exalt his character: He is drawn with a great presence of mind, in the most desperate circumstances; fear does not prevail over his reason; his wisdom dictates the means of his preservation; and his bravery of spirit supports him in the accomplishment of it. The Poet is also very judicious in the management of the speech; it is concise, and therefore proper to the occasion, there being no leisure for prolixity; every Image is drawn from the situation of the place, and his present condition; he follows Nature, and Nature is the foundation of true Poetry. These eyes at last behold th'unhop'd-for coast, No port receives me from the angry main, But the loud deeps demand me back again. Above, sharp rocks forbid access; around Roar the wild waves; beneath, is sea profound! No footing sure affords the faithless sand, To stem too rapid, and too deep to stand. If here I enter, my efforts are vain, Dash'd on the cliffs, or heav'd into the main; Or round the Island if my course I bend, Where the ports open, or the shores descend, Back to the seas the rowling surge may sweep, And bury all my hopes beneath the deep. Or some enormous whale the God may send, (For many such on Amphitrite attend) Too well the turns of mortal chance I know, And hate relentless of my heav'nly foe. While thus he thought, a monst'rous wave up-bore The Chief, and dash'd him on the craggy shore: Torn was his skin, nor had the ribs been whole, But instant Pallas enter'd in his soul. Close to the cliff with both his hands he clung, And stuck adherent, and suspended hung: 'Till the huge surge roll'd off. Then backward sweep The refluent tydes, and plunge him in the deep. As when the Polypus from forth his cave It is very surprizing to see the prodigious variety with which Homer enlivens his Poetry: he rises or falls as his subject leads him, and finds allusions proper to represent an Heroe in battle, or a person in calamity. We have here an instance of it; he compares Ulysses to a Polypus; the similitude is suited to the element, and to the condition of the person. It is observable, that this is the only full description of a person shipwreck'd in all his Poems: he therefore gives a loose to his imagination, and enlarges upon it very copiously. There appears a surprizing fertility of invention thro' the whole of it: In what a variety of attitudes is Ulysses drawn, during the storm, and at his escape from it? his soliloquies in the turns of his condition, while he is sometimes almost out of danger, and then again involv'd in new difficulties, engage our hopes and fears. He ennobles the whole by his machinery, and Neptune, Pallas and Leucothea interest themselves in his safety or destruction. He has likewise chosen the most proper occasion for a copious description; there is leisure for it. The proposition of the Poem requires him to describe a man of sufferings in the person of Ulysses: he therefore no sooner introduces him, but he throws him into the utmost calamities, and describes them largely, to shew at once the greatness of his distress, and his wisdom and patience under it. In what are the sufferings of Æneas in Virgil comparable to these of Ulysses? Æneas suffers little personally in comparison of Ulysses, his incidents have less variety, and consequently less beauty. Homer draws his Images from Nature, but embellishes those Images with the utmost Art, and fruitfulness of invention. Torn with full force, reluctant beats the wave, His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands; So the rough rock had shagg'd Ulysses' hands. And now had perish'd, whelm'd beneath the main, Th'unhappy man; ev'n Fate had been in vain: But all-subduing Pallas lent her pow'r, And Prudence sav'd him in the needful hour. Beyond the beating surge his course he bore, (A wider circle, but in sight of shore) With longing eyes, observing, to survey Some smooth ascent, or safe-sequester'd bay. Between the parting rocks at length he spy'd A falling stream with gentler waters glide; Where to the seas the shelving shore declin'd, And form'd a bay, impervious to the wind. To this calm port the glad Ulysses prest, And hail'd the river, and its God addrest. Whoe'er thou art, before whose stream unknown I bend, a suppliant at thy wat'ry throne, Hear, azure King! nor let me fly in vain To thee from Neptune and the raging main. Heav'n hears and pities hapless men like me, For sacred ev'n to Gods is Misery: This expression is bold, yet reconcileable to truth: Heav'n in reality has regard to the misery and affliction of good men, and at last delivers them from it. Res est sacra miser, as Dacier observes; and Seneca, in his dissertation on Providence, speaks to this purpose, Ecce spectaculum dignum ad quod respiciat, intentus operi suo, Deus! Ecce par Deo dignum, vir fortis cum malâ fortunâ compositus! Misery is not always a punishment, but sometimes a tryal: This is agreeable to true Theology. Let then thy waters give the weary rest, And save a suppliant, and a man distrest. He pray'd, and strait the gentle stream subsides, Detains the rushing current of his tydes, Before the wand'rer smooths the wat'ry way, Such passages as these are bold, yet beautiful. Poetry animates every thing, and turns Rivers into Gods. But what occasion is there for the intervention of this River-God to smooth the waters, when Pallas had already compos'd both the seas and the storms? The words in the original solve the objection, ?????? ?? ?? ????????; or smooth'd the way before him, that is, his own current: the actions therefore are different; Pallas gives a general calmness to the Sea, the River-God to his own current. And soft receives him from the rowling sea. That moment, fainting as he touch'd the shore, He dropt his sinewy arms: his knees no more Eustathius appears to me to give this passage a very forc'd interpretation; he imagines that the Poet, by saying that Ulysses bent his knees and arms, spoke philosophically, and intended to express that he contracted his limbs, that had been fatigued with the long extension in swimming, by a voluntary remission; lest they should grow stiff, and lose their natural faculty. But this is an impossibility: How could this be done, when he is speechless, fainting, without pulse and respiration? Undoubtedly Homer, as Dacier observes, means by the expression of ?????? ??????? ??? ??????, no more than that his limbs fail'd him, or he fainted. If the Action was voluntary, it implies that he intended to refresh them, for ???? ???????? is generally used in that sense by Homer; if involuntarily, it signifies he fainted. Perform'd their office, or his weight upheld: His swoln heart heav'd; his bloated body swell'd: From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran; And lost in lassitude lay all the man, Depriv'd of voice, of motion, and of breath; The soul scarce waking, in the arms of death. Soon as warm life its wonted office found, The mindful chief Leucothea's scarf unbound; Observant of her word, he turn'd aside His head, and cast it on the rolling tyde. Behind him far, upon the purple waves The waters waft it, and the nymph receives. Now parting from the stream, Ulysses found A mossy bank with pliant rushes crown'd; The bank he press'd, and gently kiss'd the ground. Where on the flow'ry herb as soft he lay, Thus to his soul the Sage began to say. What will ye next ordain, ye Pow'rs on high! And yet, ah yet, what fates are we to try? Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear, Thus spent already, how shall nature bear The dews descending, and nocturnal air? Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood When Morning rises? If I take the wood, And in thick shelter of innum'rous boughs Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows; Tho' fenc'd from cold, and tho' my toil be past, What savage beasts may wander in the waste? Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey To prowling bears, or lions in their way. Thus long debating in himself he stood: At length he took the passage to the Wood, Whose shady horrors on a rising brow Wav'd high, and frown'd upon the stream below. There grew two Olives, closest of the grove, With roots intwin'd, and branches interwove; Alike their leaves, but not alike they smil'd With sister-fruits; one fertile, one was wild. Nor here the sun's meridian rays had pow'r, Nor wind sharp-piercing, nor the rushing show'r: The verdant Arch so close its texture kept: Beneath this covert, great Ulysses crept. Of gather'd leaves an ample bed he made, (Thick strown by tempest thro' the bow'ry shade) Where three at least might winter's cold defy, Tho' Boreas rag'd along th'inclement sky. This store, with joy the patient Heroe found, And sunk amidst 'em, heap'd the leaves around. As some poor peasant, fated to reside Homer is very happy in giving dignity to low Images. What can be more unpromising than this comparison, and what more successfully executed? Ulysses, in whom remains as it were but a spark of life, the vital heat being extinguish'd by the shipwreck, is very justly compar'd to a brand, that retains only some small remains of fire; the leaves that cover Ulysses, are represented by the embers, and the preservation of the fire all night, paints the revival of his spirits by the repose of the night; the expression, ? Fated to reside Remote from neighbours, is not added in vain; it gives, as Eustathius further observes, an air of credibility to the allusion, as if it had really been drawn from some particular observation; a person that lives in a desart being oblig'd to such circumstantial cares, where it is impossible to have a supply, for want of neighbours. Homer literally calls these remains the seeds of fire; Æschylus in his Prometheus calls a spark of fire ????? ?????, or a fountain of fire; less happily in my judgment, the ideas of fire and water being contradictory. Remote from neighbours, in a forest wide, Studious to save what human wants require, In embers heap'd, preserves the seeds of fire: Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lyes, 'Till Pallas pour'd soft slumbers on his eyes; And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose) Lull'd all his cares, and banish'd all his woes. This book begins with the seventh day, and comprehends the space of twenty five days; the first of which is taken up in the message of Mercury, and interview between Calypso and Ulysses; the four following in the building of the vessel; eighteen before the storm, and two after it. So that one and thirty days are compleated, since the opening of the Poem. THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. Pallas appearing in a dream to Nausicaa, (the daughter of Alcinous King of Phæacia) commands her to descend to the river, and wash the robes of State, in preparation to her nuptials. Nausicaa goes with her Handmaids to the river; where, while the garments are spread on the bank, they divert themselves in sports. Their Voices awake Ulysses, who addressing himself to the Princess, is by her relieved and cloathed, and receives directions in what manner to apply to the King and Queen of the Island. While thus the weary Wand'rer sunk to rest, And peaceful slumbers calm'd his anxious breast; The martial Maid from heav'n's aereal height Swift to Phæacia wing'd her rapid flight. In elder times the soft Phæacian train In ease possest the wide Hyperian plain; 'Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose, A lawless nation of gygantic foes: Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far Thro' seas retreating from the sound of war, The recreant nation to fair Scheria led, Where never science rear'd her lawrel'd head: The Phæacians having a great share in the succeeding parts of the Odyssey, it may not be improper to enlarge upon their character. Homer has here describ'd them very distinctly: he is to make use of the Phæacians to convey Ulysses to his country, he therefore by this short character, gives the Reader such an Image of them, that he is not surpriz'd at their credulity and simplicity, in believing all those fabulous recitals which Ulysses makes in the Progress of the Poem. The place likewise in which he describes them is well chosen; it is before they enter upon Action, and by this method we know what to expect from them, and see how every action is naturally suited to their character. Bossu observes that the Poet has inserted this verse with great judgment: Ulysses, says he, knew that the Phæacians were simple and credulous; and that they had all the qualities of a lazy people, who admire nothing so much as romantic adventures: he therefore pleases them, by recitals suited to their own humour: But even here the Poet is not unmindful of his more understanding Readers, and the truth intended to be taught by way of moral is, that a soft and effeminate life breaks the spirit, and renders it incapable of manly sentiments or actions. Plutarch seems to understand this verse in a different manner; he quotes it in his dissertation upon Banishment, to shew that Nausithous made his people happy tho' he left his own country, and settled them far from the commerce of mankind, ???? ?????? ?????????, without any particular view to the Phæacians, which was undoubtedly intended by Homer; those words being a kind of a Preface to their general character. This Phæacia of the ancients is the Island now called Corfu. The Inhabitants of it were a Colony of the Hyperians: Eustathius remarks, that it has been a question whether Hyperia were a City or an Island; he judges it to be a City: it was infested by the Cyclops; but they had no shipping, as appears from the tenth of the Odyssey, and consequently if it had been an Island, they could not have molested the Phæacians; he therefore concludes it to be a City, afterwards call'd Camarina in Sicily. Mr. Barnes has here added a verse that is not to be found in any other edition; and I have render'd it in the translation. There round his tribes a strength of wall he rais'd, To heav'n the glitt'ring domes and temples blaz'd; Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds, And shar'd the lands, and gave the lands their bounds. Now in the silent grave the Monarch lay, And wise Alcinous held the regal sway. To his high palace thro' the fields of air The Goddess shot; Ulysses was her care. There, as the night in silence roll'd away, A heav'n of charms divine Nausicaa lay: Thro' the thick gloom the shining portals blaze; Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace. The Poet, as Eustathius observes, celebrates the beauty of these two attending Virgins to raise their characters, that they may not be esteem'd common servants, or the Poet thought extravagant when he compares Nausicaa and her damsels to Diana and her nymphs. The judgment with which he introduces the vision is remarkable: In the Iliad, when he is to give an air of importance to his vision, he cloathes it in the likeness of Nestor, the wisest person of the Army; a man of less consideration had been unsuitable to the greatness of the occasion, which was to persuade Kings and Heroes. Here the Poet sends a vision to a young Lady, under the resemblance of a young Lady: he adapts the circumstances to the person, and describes the whole with an agreeable propriety. Eustathius. Light as the viewless air, the warrior Maid Glides thro' the valves, and hovers round her head; A fav'rite virgin's blooming form she took, From Dymas sprung, and thus the vision spoke: Oh indolent! to waste thy hours away! And sleep'st thou, careless of the bridal day? Thy spousal ornament neglected lies; Here is a remarkable custom of Antiquity. Eustathius observes, that it was usual for the bride to give changes of dress to the friends of the bridegroom at the celebration of the marriage, and Homer directly affirms it. Dacier quotes a passage in Judges concerning Sampson's giving changes of garments at his marriage feast, as an instance of the like custom amongst the Israelites; but I believe, if there was such a custom at all amongst them, it is not evident from the passage alledg'd: Nothing is plainer, than that Sampson had not given the garments, if his riddle had not been expounded: nay, instead of giving, he himself had receiv'd them, if it had not been interpreted. I am rather of opinion that what is said of Sampson, has relation to another custom amongst the Ancients, of proposing an Ænigma at festivals, and adjudging a reward to him that solv'd it. These the Greeks call'd ??????? ???????????; griphos convivales; Athenæus has a long dissertation about this practice in his tenth book, and gives a number of instances of the Ænigmatical propositions in use at Athens, and of the forfeitures and rewards upon the solution, and non-solution of them; and Eustathius in the tenth book of the Odyssey comes into the same opinion. So that if it was a custom amongst the Israelites as well as Greeks to give garments, (as it appears to be to give other gifts) this passage is no instance of it: It is indeed a proof that the Hebrews as well as Greeks had a custom of entertaining themselves at their festivals, with these griphi convivales: I therefore believe that these changes of garments were no more than rewards or forfeits, according to the success in the interpretation. Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise! A just applause the cares of dress impart, It is very probable that Quintilian had this verse in his view when he wrote Cultus magnificus addit hominibus, ut Græco versu testatum est, authoritatem. His words are almost a translation of it. ?? ??? ??? ?????? ????? ????????? ?????????, ????? What I would chiefly observe is the propriety with which this commendation of dress is introduc'd; it is put into the mouth of a young Lady (for so Pallas appears to be) to whose character it is suitable to delight in Ornament. It likewise agrees very well with the description of the Phæacians, whose chief happiness consisted in dancing, dressing, singing, &amp;c. Such a commendation of ornament would have been improper in the mouth of a Philosopher, but beautiful when spoken by a young Lady to Alcinous. And give soft transport to a parent's heart. Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way, This passage has not escap'd the raillery of the Critics; Homer, say they, brings the Goddess of Wisdom down from heaven, only to advise Nausicaa to make haste to wash her cloaths against her wedding: what necessity is there for a conduct so extraordinary upon so trivial an occasion? Eustathius sufficiently answers the objection, by observing that the Poet very naturally brings about the safety of Ulysses by it; the action of the washing is the means, the protection of Ulysses the end of the descent of that Goddess; so that she is not introduced lightly, or without contributing to an important action: And it must be allow'd, that the means made use of are very natural; they grow out of the occasion, and at once give the fable a poetical turn, and an air of probability. It has been further objected, that the Poet gives an unworthy employment to Nausicaa, the daughter of a King; but such Critics form their idea of ancient, from modern greatness: It wou'd be now a meanness to describe a person of Quality thus employ'd, because custom has made it the work of persons of low condition: It would be now thought dishonourable for a Lady of bright station to attend the flocks; yet we find in the most ancient history extant, that the daughters of Laban and Jethro, persons of power and distinction, were so employ'd, without any dishonour to their quality. In short, these passages are to be look'd upon as exact pictures of the old World, and consequently as valuable remains of Antiquity. When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray: Haste to the stream! companion of thy care Lo I thy steps attend, thy labours share. Virgin awake! the marriage hour is nigh, See! from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh! The royal car at early dawn obtain It would have been an impropriety to have render'd ?????? by the word chariot; Homer seems industriously to avoid ????, but constantly uses ?????, or ?????; this car was drawn by mules; whereas, observes Eustathius, the chariot or ???? was proper only for horses. The word Car takes in the Idea of any other vehicle, as well as of a Chariot. This passage has undergone a very severe censure, as mean and ridiculous, chiefly from the expressions to her father afterwards, ??????, ????????: which being render'd, high, and round, disgrace the Author: No person, I believe, would ask a father to lend his high and round Car; nor has Homer said it: Eustathius observes, that ???????? is the same as ???????? ????? ???????? ?? ??????, or wheels; and that ?????????, is ?? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?????, or the quadrangular body of the Car that rests upon the axle of it; this fully answers the Criticism: Nausicaa describes the Car so particularly, to distinguish it from a Chariot, which had been improper for her purpose: The other part of the objection, concerning the roundness of the Car, is a mistake in the Critic; the word having relation to the wheels, and not to the body of it, which, as Eustathius observes, was quadrangular. And order mules obedient to the rein; For rough the way, and distant rolls the wave Where their fair vests Phæacian virgins lave. In pomp ride forth; for pomp becomes the great, And Majesty derives a grace from State. Then to the Palaces of heav'n she sails, Lucretius has copy'd this fine passage, and equall'd, if not surpass'd the original. Apparet Divûm numen, sedesque quietæ Quas neque concutiunt venti, neque nubila nimbis Aspergunt, neque nix acri concreta pruinâ Cana cadens violat: semperque innubilus æther Integit, &amp; largè diffuso lumine ridet. The picture is the same in both Authors, but the colouring in my opinion is less beautiful in Homer than Lucretius: the three last lines in particular are fuller of ornament, and the very verses have an air of the serenity they were intended to paint. Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales: The seat of Gods, the regions mild of peace, Full joy, and calm Eternity of ease. There no rude winds presume to shake the skies, No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise; But on immortal thrones the blest repose: The firmament with living splendors glows. Hither the Goddess wing'd th'aereal way, Thro' heav'n's eternal gates that blaz'd with day. Now from her rosy car Aurora shed The dawn, and all the orient flam'd with red. Uprose the virgin with the morning light, Obedient to the vision of the night. The Queen she sought: the Queen her hours bestow'd This is another image of ancient life: We see a Queen amidst her attendants at work at the dawn of day: de nocte surrexit, &amp; digiti ejus apprehenderant fusum. This is a practice as contrary to the manners of our ages, as the other of washing the robes: 'Tis the more remarkable in this Queen, because she liv'd amongst an idle effeminate people, that lov'd nothing but pleasures. Dacier. In curious works; the whirling spindle glow'd With crimson threads, while busy damsels cull The snowy fleece, or twist the purpled wool. Mean-time Phæacia's peers in council sate; From his high dome the King descends in state, Then with a filial awe the royal maid Approach'd him passing, and submissive said; Will my dread Sire his ear regardful deign, And may his child the royal car obtain? Say, with thy garments shall I bend my way Where thro' the vales the mazy waters stray? A dignity of dress adorns the great, And Kings draw lustre from the robe of state. Five sons thou hast; three wait the bridal day, And spotless robes become the young and gay: So when with praise amid the dance they shine, By these my cares adorn'd, that praise is mine. Thus she: but blushes ill-restrain'd betray Her thoughts intentive on the bridal day: The conscious Sire the dawning blush survey'd, And smiling thus bespoke the blooming maid. My child, my darling joy, the car receive; That, and whate'er our daughter asks, we give. Swift at the royal nod th'attending train The car prepare, the mules incessant rein. The blooming virgin with dispatchful cares Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial bears. It is not without reason that the Poet describes Nausicaa carrying the whole wardrobe of the family to the river: he inserts these circumstances so particularly, that she may be able to cloath Ulysses in the sequel of the story: he further observes the modesty and simplicity of these early times, when the whole dress of a King and his family (who reign'd over a people that delighted in dress) is without gold: for we see Nausicaa carries with her all the habits that were used at the greatest solemnities; which had they been wrought with gold could not have been washed. Eustathius. The Queen, assiduous, to her train assigns The sumptuous viands, and the flav'rous wines. The train prepare a cruise of curious mold, A cruise of fragrance, form'd of burnish'd gold; Odour divine! whose soft refreshing streams Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs. Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins This Image of Nausicaa riding in her Car to the river, has exercis'd the pencils of excellent Painters. Pausanias in his fifth book, which is the first of the Eliacs, speaks of a picture of two Virgins drawn by Mules, of which the one guides the reins, the other has her head cover'd with a veil: It is believ'd that it represents Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, going with one of her virgins to the river. The words of Pausanias have caused some doubt with relation to the picture; he says, ??? ???????, or upon Mules, but Homer describes her upon a Car; how then can Nausicaa be intended by the Painter? But Romulus Amasæus, who comments upon Pausanias, solves the difficulty, by observing that ??? ??????? does not signify upon Mules, but a Car drawn by Mules, by a figure frequent in all Authors. Pliny is also thus to be understood in his 35?? book; Protogenes the Rhodian painted at Athens Paralus, and likewise Hemionida, who is said to represent Nausicaa; Hemionida is used (as Hermolaus Barbarus observes upon that passage) as a term of art to express a Virgin riding upon, or more properly drawn by Mules, or ??? ???????. Spondanus. Shine in her hand: Along the sounding plains Swift fly the mules: nor rode the nymph alone, Around, a beavy of bright damsels shone. They seek the cisterns where Phæacian dames Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams; Where gathering into depth from falling rills, It is evident, that the Ancients had basons, or cisterns, continually supply'd by the rivers for this business of washing; they were call'd, observes Eustathius, ??????, or ??????; and were sometimes made of marble, other times of wood. Thus in the Iliad, book 22?, Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills, Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills, Where Trojan dames ere yet alarm'd by Greece, Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace. The manner of washing was different from what is now in use: They trod them with their feet, ??????, ??????? ???? ????. Eustathius. It may be thought that these customs are of small importance, and of little concern to the present ages: It is true; but Time has stamp'd a value upon them: like ancient Medals, their intrinsic worth may be small, but yet they are valuable, because images of Antiquity. Plutarch in his Symposiacs proposes this question, Why Nausicaa washes in the river, rather than the sea, tho' it was more high, more hot, and consequently more fit for the purpose than the river? Theon answers from Aristotle, that the sea-water has many gross, rough, and earthy particles in it, as appears from its saltness, whereas fresh water is more pure and unmixt, and consequently more subtle and penetrating, and fitter for use in washing. Themistocles dislikes this reason, and affirms that sea-water being more rough and earthy, than that of rivers, is therefore the most proper, for its cleansing quality; this appears from observation, for in washing, ashes, or some such substance are thrown into the fresh water to make it effectual, for those particles open the pores, and conduce to the effect of cleansing. The true reason then is, that there is an unctuous nature in sea water, (and Aristotle confesses all salt to be unctuous) which hinders it from cleansing: whereas river-water is pure, less mixt, and consequently more subtle and penetrating, and being free from all oily substance, is preferable and more effectual than sea-water. The lucid wave a spacious bason fills. The mules unharness'd range beside the main, Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain. Then æmulous the royal robes they lave, And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave: (The vestures cleans'd o'erspread the shelly sand, Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand.) Then with a short repast relieve their toil, And o'er their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil: And while the robes imbibe the solar ray, O'er the green mead the sporting virgins play: (Their shining veils unbound.) Along the skies Tost, and retost, the ball incessant flies. They sport, they feast; Nausicaa lifts her voice, And warbling sweet, makes earth and heav'n rejoice. As when o'er Erymanth Diana roves, This is a very beautiful comparison, (and when-ever I say any thing in commendation of Homer, I would always be understood to mean the original.) Virgil was sensible of it, and inserted it in his Poem, Qualis in Eurotæ ripis aut per juga Cynthi Exercet Diana choros; quam mille secutæ Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades: illa pharetram Fert humero, gradiensque dea supereminet omnes: Latonæ tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus. It has given occasion for various Criticisms, with relation to the beauty of the two Authors. I will lay before the Reader what is said in behalf of Homer in Aulus Gellius, and the answer by Scaliger. Gellius writes, that it was the opinion of Valerius Probus, that no passage has been more unhappily copy'd by Virgil, than this comparison. Homer very beautifully compares Nausicaa, a Virgin, sporting with her damsels in a solitary place, to Diana, a virgin Goddess, taking her diversion in a forest, in hunting with her rural Nymphs. Whereas Dido, a widow, is drawn by Virgil in the midst of a city, walking gravely with the Tyrian Princes, Instans operi, regnisque futuris, a circumstance that bears not the least resemblance to the sports of the Goddess. Homer represents Diana with her quiver at her shoulder, but at the same time he describes her as an huntress: Virgil gives her a quiver, but mentions nothing of her as an huntress, and consequently lays a needless burthen upon her shoulder. Homer excellently paints the fulness of joy which Latona felt at the sight of her daughter, ?????? ?? ?? ????? ????; Virgil falls infinitely short of it in the word pertentant, which signifies a light joy that sinks not deep into the heart. Lastly, Virgil has omitted the strongest point and very flower of the comparison, ?(??? ?? ???????? ???????, ????? ?? ?? ?????. 'Tis the last circumstance that compleats the comparison, as it distinguishes Nausicaa from her attendants, for which very purpose the allusion was introduced. Scaliger (who never deserts Virgil in any difficulty) answers, that the persons, not the places, are intended to be represented by both Poets; otherwise Homer himself is blameable, for Nausicaa is not sporting on a mountain but a plain, and has neither bow nor quiver like Diana. Neither is there any weight in the objection concerning the gravity of the gait of Dido; for neither is Nausicaa describ'd in the act of hunting, but dancing: And as for the word pertentant, it is a metaphor taken from musicians and musical instruments: it denotes a strong degree of joy, per bears an intensive sense, and takes in the perfection of joy. As to the quiver, it was an ensign of the Goddess, as ??????????? was of Apollo, and is apply'd to her upon all occasions indifferently, not only by Virgil, but more frequently by Homer. Lastly, ???? ?? ???????? &amp;c. is superfluous, for the joy of Latona compleats the whole, and Homer has already said ?????? ?? ?? ????? ????. But still it must be allow'd, that there is a greater correspondence to the subject intended to be illustrated, in Homer than in Virgil. Diana sports; so does Nausicaa; Diana is a Virgin, so is Nausicaa; Diana is amongst her virgin Nymphs, Nausicaa among her virgin attendants: whereas in all these points there is the greatest dissimilitude between Dido and Diana: And no one I believe but Scaliger can think the verse above quoted superfluous, which indeed is the beauty and perfection of comparison. There may, perhaps, be a more rational objection made against this line in both Poets. Latonæ tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus. This verse has no relation to the principal subject, the expectation is fully satisfy'd without it, and it alludes to nothing that either precedes or follows it, and consequently may be judg'd superfluous. Or wide Täygetus' resounding groves; A sylvan train the huntress Queen surrounds, Her ratling quiver from her shoulder sounds: Fierce in the sport, along the mountain brow They bay the boar, or chase the bounding roe: High o'er the lawn, with more majestic pace, Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace; Distinguish'd excellence the Goddess proves; Exults Latona as the virgin moves. With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain, And shone transcendent o'er the beauteous train. Mean time (the care and fav'rite of the skies) Wrapt in embow'ring shade, Ulysses lies, His woes forgot! But Pallas now addrest To break the bands of all-composing rest. Forth from her snowy hand Nausicaa threw This Play with the Ball was called ??????, and ????????, by the Ancients; and from the signification of the word, which is deception, we may learn the nature of the Play: The ball was thrown to some one of the players unexpectedly, and he as unexpectedly threw it to some other of the company to catch, from which surprize upon one another, it took the name of ??????. It was a sport much in use amongst the Ancients, both men and women; it caus'd a variety of motions in throwing and running, and was therefore a very healthful exercise. The Lacedæmonians were remarkable for the use of it; Alexander the Great frequently exercised at it; and Sophocles wrote a Play, call'd ?????????, or Lotrices; in which he represented Nausicaa sporting with her damsels at this play: It is not now extant. Dionysidorus gives us a various reading, instead of ??????? ?????? ??????, he writes it, ?????? ??????, which the Latins render ?????, and Suidas countenances the alteration, for he writes that a damsel named Larissa, as she sported at this play, (????, not ??????) was drowned in the river Peneus. Eustathius. What I would further observe is, the art of the Poet in carrying on the story: He proceeds from incident to incident very naturally, and makes the sports of these Virgins contribute to the principal design of the Poem, and promote the re-establishment of Ulysses, by discovering him advantageously to the Phæacians. He so judiciously interweaves these sports into the texture of the story, that there would be a chasm if they were taken away; and the sports of the Virgins are as much of a piece with the whole, as any of the labours of Ulysses. The Poet reaps a further advantage from this conduct: it beautifies and enlivens the Poem with a pleasant and entertaining scene, and relieves the Reader's mind by taking it off from a continual representation of horrour and sufferings in the story of Ulysses. He himself seems here to take breath, and indulging his fancy, lets it run out into several beautiful comparisons, to prepare the Reader to hear with a better relish the long detail of the calamities of his Heroe, thro' the sequel of the Odyssey. The various ball; the ball erroneous flew, And swam the stream: Loud shrieks the virgin train, And the loud shriek redoubles from the main. Wak'd by the shrilling sound, Ulysses rose, And to the deaf woods wailing, breath'd his woes. Ah me! on what inhospitable coast, This soliloquy is well adapted to the circumstances of Ulysses, and short, as is requisite in all soliloquies. Virgil has imitated it, and Scaliger in general prefers the copy to the original. Ut primum lux alma data est, exire; locosque Explorare novos, quas vento accesserit oras: Qui teneant (nam inculta videt) hominesne, feræne, Quærere constituit? But it may perhaps be true, that Virgil here falls short of Homer: There is not that harmony of numbers, that variety of circumstances, and sentiments in the Latin, as appears in the Greek Poet; and above all, the whole passage has more force and energy by being put into the mouth of Ulysses, than when merely related by Virgil. Dacier observes, that Abraham makes the very same reflections as Ulysses, upon his arrival at Gerar. Cogitavi mecum dicens, forsitan non est timor domini in loco isto, Gen. xx. 11. I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; which very well answers to ??? ???? ???? ???? ???????. On what new region is Ulysses tost? Possest by wild barbarians fierce in arms, Or men, whose bosom tender pity warms? What sounds are these that gather from the shores? The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bow'rs? The fair-hair'd Dryads of the shady wood, Or azure daughters of the silver flood? Or human voice? but issuing from the shades Why cease I strait to learn what sound invades? Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends, With forceful strength a branch the Heroe rends; Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads This passage has given great offence to the Critics. The interview between Ulysses and Nausicaa, says Rapine, outrages all the rules of decency: She forgets her modesty, and betrays her virtue, by giving too long an audience: she yields too much to his complaints, and indulges her curiosity too far at the sight of a person in such circumstances. But perhaps Rapine is too severe; Homer has guarded every circumstance with as much caution as if he had been aware of the objection: He covers his loins with a broad foliage, (for Eustathius observes, that ??????? signifies ?????? ??????, or a broad branch) he makes Ulysses speak at a proper distance, and introduces Minerva to encourage her virgin modesty. Is there here any outrage of decency? Besides, what takes off this objection of immodesty in Nausicaa, is, that the sight of a naked man was not unusual in those ages; it was customary for Virgins of the highest quality to attend Heroes to the bath, and even to assist in bathing them, without any breach of modesty; as is evident from the conduct of Polycaste in the conclusion of the third book of the Odyssey, who bathes and perfumes Telemachus. If this be true, the other objections of Rapine about her yielding too much to his complaints, &amp;c. are of no weight; but so many testimonies of her virtuous and compassionate disposition, which induces her to pity and relieve calamity. Yet it may seem that the other damsels had a different opinion of this interview, and that thro' modesty they ran away, while Nausicaa alone talks with Ulysses: But this only shews, not that she had less modesty, but more prudence, than her retinue. The damsels fled not out of modesty, but fear of an enemy: whereas Nausicaa wisely reflects that no such person could arrive there, the country being an Island; and from his appearance, she rightly concluded him to be a man in calamity. This Wisdom is the Pallas in the Allegory, which makes her to stay when the other damsels fly for want of equal reflection. Adam and Eve cover'd themselves after the same manner as Ulysses. A wreathy foliage, and concealing shades. As when a Lion in the midnight hours This is a very noble comparison, yet has not escap'd censure; it has been objected that it is improper for the occasion, as bearing images of too much terror, only to fright a few timorous Virgins, and that the Poet is unseasonably sublime. This is only true in Burlesque poetry, where the most noble images are frequently assembled to disgrace the subject, and to shew a ridiculous disproportion between the allusion and the principal subject; but the same reason will not hold in Epic Poetry, where the Poet raises a low circumstance into dignity by a sublime comparison. The simile is not introduced merely to shew the impression it made upon the Virgins, but paints Ulysses himself in very strong colours: Ulysses is fatigued with the tempests and waves; the Lion with winds and storms: it is hunger that drives the Lion upon his prey; an equal necessity compells Ulysses to go down to the Virgins: the Lion is described in all his terrors, Ulysses arms himself as going upon an unknown adventure; so that the comparison is very noble and very proper. This verse in particular has something horrible in the very run of it. ?????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????????? ???? Dionysius Halicarn, in his observations upon the placing of words quotes it to this purpose; When Homer, says he, is to introduce a terrible or unusual Image, he rejects the more flowing and harmonious vowels, and makes choice of such mutes and consonants as load the syllables, and render the pronunciation difficult. Pausanias writes in his Attics, that the famous Painter Polygnotus painted this subject in the gallery at Athens. ?????? ?? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ?????????? ??????????? ???????; he painted Ulysses approaching Nausicaa and her damsels, as they were washing at the river. This is the same Polygnotus who painted in the gallery called ???????, the battle of Marathon gain'd by Miltiades over the Medes and Persians. Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wint'ry show'rs, Descends terrific from the mountain's brow, With living flames his rowling eye-balls glow; With conscious strength elate, he bends his way Majestically fierce, to seize his prey; (The steer or stag:) or with keen hunger bold Springs o'er the fence, and dissipates the fold. No less a terror, from the neighb'ring groves Rough from the tossing surge Ulysses moves; Urg'd on by want, and recent from the storms; The brackish ooze his manly grace deforms. Wide o'er the shore with many a piercing cry To rocks, to caves, the frighted virgins fly; All but the Nymph: the nymph stood fix'd alone, By Pallas arm'd with boldness not her own. Mean-time in dubious thought the King awaits, And self-considering, as he stands, debates; Distant his mournful story to declare, Or prostrate at her knee address the pray'r. But fearful to offend, by wisdom sway'd, At awful distance he accosts the maid. If from the skies a Goddess, or if earth There never was a more agreeable and insinuating piece of flattery, than this address of Ulysses; and yet nothing mean appears in it, as is usual in almost all flattery. The only part that seems liable to any imputation, is that exaggeration at the beginning, of calling her a Goddess; yet this is propos'd with modesty and doubt, and hypothetically. Eustathius assigns two reasons why he resembles her to Diana, rather than to any other Deity; either because he found her and her damsels in a solitary place, such as Diana is suppos'd to frequent with her rural Nymphs; or perhaps Ulysses might have seen some statue or picture of that Goddess, to which Nausicaa bore a likeness. Virgil (who has imitated this passage) is more bold, when without any doubt or hesitation, before he knew Venus, he pronounces the person with whom he talks, O Dea, certè. Ovid has copy'd this passage in his Metamorphosis, book the 4??. ? puer ô dignissime credi Esse Deus; seu tu Deus es; potes esse Cupideo: Sive es mortalis; qui te genuere beati! Et frater felix, &amp; quæ dedit ubera nutrix! Sed longe cunctis longeque potentior illa Si qua tibi sponsa est, si quam dignabere tædâ! Scaliger prefers Virgil's imitation to Homer; O, quam te memorem virgo! namque haud tibi vultus Mortalis, nec vox hominem sonat. O Dea, certè! An Phœbi soror, an Nympharum sanguinis una? See his reasons in the fifth book of his Poetics. But Scaliger brings a much heavier charge against Homer, as having stoll'n the verses from Musæus, and disgraced them by his alterations. The verses are as follow. ????? ???? ???? ??????, ??????? ???? ??????, ?? ??? ?????????????? ???? ????? ?? ????????. ???? ?? ??????????? ???? ?????????, ????? ?????? ?? ?? ????????, ??? ????? ? ???? ????? ??????, ? ?? ????????, ?????????. Scaliger imagines this Musæus to be the same mention'd by Virgil, in the Elysian fields, Musæum ante omnes, &amp;c. But I believe it is now agreed, that all the works of the ancient Musæus are perish'd, and that the person who wrote these verses liv'd many centuries after Homer, and consequently borrow'd them from him. Scaliger calls them fine and lively in Musæus, but abject, unnervate, and unharmonious in Homer. But his prejudice against Homer is too apt to give a wrong biass to his judgment. Is the similitude of sound in ???? ???? in the second verse of Musæus, harmonious? and is there not a tautology in the two last lines? Happy is the mother that bore thee, and most happy the womb that brought thee forth; as if the happy person in the former line, were not the same with the most happy in the latter! Whereas Homer still rises in his Images, and ends with a compliment very agreeable to a beautiful Woman. But blest o'er all, the youth with heavenly charms, Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms! But this is submitted to the Reader's better judgment. (Imperial Virgin) boast thy glorious birth, To thee I bend! if in that bright disguise Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies, Hail, Dian, hail! the huntress of the groves So shines majestic, and so stately moves, So breathes an air divine! But if thy race Be mortal, and this earth thy native place, Blest is the father from whose loins you sprung, Blest is the mother at whose breast you hung, Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide, To such a miracle of charms ally'd: Joyful they see applauding princes gaze, In the original, there is a false construction, for after ????? ?????? ????????, Ulysses uses ??????????, whereas it ought to be ????????; but this disorder is not without its effect, it represents the modest confusion with which he addresses Nausicaa; he is struck with a religious awe at the sight of her, (for so ????? properly signifies,) and consequently naturally falls into a confusion of expression: This is not a negligence, but a beauty. Eustath. When stately in the dance you swim th'harmonious maze. But blest o'er all, the youth with heav'nly charms, Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms! Never, I never view'd 'till this blest hour Such finish'd grace! I gaze and I adore! Thus seems the Palm with stately honours crown'd This allusion is introduced to image the stateliness, and exactness of shape in Nausicaa, to the mind of the Reader; and so Tully, as Spondanus observes, understands it. Cicero, 1. de legibus. Aut quod Homericus Ulysses Deli se proceram &amp; terram palmam vidisse dixit, hodie monstrant candem. Pliny also mentions this Palm, lib. 14. cap. 44. Necnon palma Deli ab ejusdem Dei ætate conspicitur: The story of the Palm is this: “When Latona was in travail of Apollo in Delos, the earth that instant produced a large Palm, against which she rested in her labour.” Homer mentions it in his Hymns. ????????? ? ???????? ????????. And also Callimachus. ?????? ?? ?????, ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ????? ???????? ???? ???????. And again. ? ????????? ? ?????? ??? ?? ?????? ????????. This allusion is after the oriental manner. Thus in the Psalms, how frequently are persons compar'd to Cedars? and in the same Author, children are resembled to Olive branches. This Palm was much celebrated by the Ancients, the superstion of the age had given it a religious veneration, and even in the times of Tully the natives esteem'd it immortal; (for so the above-mention'd words imply;) This gives weight and beauty to the address of Ulysses, and it could not but be very acceptable to a young Lady, to hear herself compar'd to the greatest wonder in the Creation. Dionysius Halicarn. observes the particular beauty of these two verses. ???? ?????? ????? ????????? ???? ????, ???????? ???? ????? ??????????? ??????. When Homer, says he, would paint an elegance of beauty, or represent any agreeable object, he makes use of the smoothest vowels and most flowing semivowels, as in the lines last recited: He rejects harsh sounds, and a collision of rough words; but the lines flow along with a smooth harmony of letters and syllables, without any offence to the ear by asperity of sound. By Phœbus' altars; thus o'erlooks the ground; The pride of Delos. (By the Delian coast I voyag'd, leader of a warrior host, But ah how chang'd! from thence my sorrow flows; O fatal voyage, source of all my woes!) There is some obscurity in this passage: Ulysses speaks in general, and does not specify what voyage he means. It may therefore be ask'd how is it to be understood? Eustathius answers, that the voyage of the Greeks to the Trojan expedition is intended by the Poet; for Lycophron writes, that the Greeks sail'd by Delos in their passage to Troy. Homer passes over the voyage in this transient manner without a further explanation: Ulysses had no leisure to enlarge upon that story, but reserves it more advantageously for a future discovery before Alcinous and the Phæacian rulers. By this conduct he avoids a repetition, which must have been tedious to the reader, who would have found little appetite afterwards, if he had already been satisfied by a full discovery made to Nausicaa. The obscurity therefore arises from choice, not want of judgment. Raptur'd I stood, and as this hour amaz'd, With rev'rence at the lofty wonder gaz'd: Raptur'd I stand! for earth ne'er knew to bear A plant so stately, or a nymph so fair. Aw'd from access, I lift my suppliant hands; For Misery, oh Queen, before thee stands! Twice ten tempestuous nights I roll'd, resign'd To roaring billows, and the warring wind; Heav'n bad the deep to spare! but heav'n my foe Spares only to inflict some mightier woe! Inur'd to cares, to death in all its forms, Outcast I rove, familiar with the storms! Once more I view the face of humankind: Oh let soft pity touch thy gen'rous mind! Unconscious of what air I breathe, I stand Naked, defenceless on a foreign land. Propitious to my wants, a Vest supply To guard the wretched from th'inclement sky: So may the Gods who heav'n and earth controul, Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul, On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed, Blest with a husband be thy bridal bed, Blest be thy husband with a blooming race, And lasting union crown your blissful days. The Gods, when they supremely bless, bestow Firm union on their Favourites below; Then Envy grieves, with inly-pining Hate; The good exult, and heav'n is in our state. To whom the Nymph: O stranger cease thy care, Wise is thy soul, but man is born to bear: Jove weighs affairs of earth in dubious scales, The morality of this passage is excellent, and very well adapted to the present occasion. Ulysses had said, Heav'n bade the deep to spare! but heav'n my foe Spares only to inflict some mightier woe. Nausicaa makes use of this expression to pay her address to Ulysses, and at the same time teaches, conformably to truth, that the afflicted are not always the objects of divine hate: The Gods (adds she) bestow good and evil indifferently, and therefore we must not judge of men from their conditions, for good men are frequently wretched, and bad men happy. Nay sometimes affliction distinguishes a man of goodness, when he bears it with a greatness of spirit. Sophocles puts a very beautiful expression into the mouth of OEdipus, ?????? ?????, the beauty and ornament of calamities. Eustathius. Longinus is of opinion, that when great Poets and Writers sink in their vigour, and cannot reach the Pathetic, they descend to the Moral. Hence he judges the Odyssey to be the work of Homer's declining years, and gives that as a reason of its morality: He speaks not this out of derogation to Homer, for he compares him to the Sun, which tho' it has not the same warmth as when in the Meridian, is always of the same bigness: This is no dishonour to the Odyssey; the most useful, if not the most beautiful circumstance is allow'd it, I mean Instruction; In the Odyssey Homer appears to be the better Man, in the Iliad the better Poet. And the good suffers, while the bad prevails: Bear, with a soul resign'd, the will of Jove; Who breathes, must mourn: thy woes are from above. But since thou tread'st our hospitable shore, 'Tis mine to bid the wretched grieve no more, To cloath the naked, and thy way to guide— Know, the Phæacian tribes this land divide; From great Alcinous' royal loins I spring, A happy nation, and an happy King. Then to her maids—Why, why, ye coward train These fears, this flight? ye fear, and fly in vain. Dread ye a foe? dismiss that idle dread, 'Tis death with hostile step these shores to tread: This I take to be the meaning of the word ??????, which Eustathius explains by ??? ??? ?????????, vivus &amp; valens; or, he shall not be long-liv'd. But it may be ask'd how this character of valour in destroying their enemies, can agree with the Phæacians, an effeminate, unwarlike nation? Eustathius answers, that the protection of the Gods is the best defence, and upon this Nausicaa relies. But then it is necessary that man should co-operate with the Gods; for it is in vain to rely upon the Gods for safety, if we our selves make not use of means proper for it: whereas the Phæacians were a people wholly given up to luxury and pleasures. The true reason then of Nausicaa's praise of the Phæacians may perhaps be drawn from that honourable partiality, and innate love which every person feels for his country. She knew no people greater than the Phæacians, and having ever liv'd in full security from enemies, she concludes that it is not in the power of enemies to disturb that security. Safe in the love of heav'n, an ocean flows Around our realm, a barrier from the foes; 'Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve, Chear the sad heart, nor let affliction grieve. By Jove the stranger and the poor are sent, This is a very remarkable passage, full of such a pious generosity as the wisest teach, and the best practise. I am sensible it may be understood two ways; and in both, it bears an excellent instruction. The words are, the poor and stranger are from Jove, and a small gift is acceptable to them, or acceptable to Jupiter, ??? ????. I have chosen the latter, in conformity to the eastern way of thinking: He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord, as it is expressed in the Proverbs. And what to those we give, to Jove is lent. Then food supply, and bathe his fainting limbs Where waving shades obscure the mazy streams. Obedient to the call, the chief they guide To the calm current of the secret tyde; Close by the stream a royal dress they lay, A vest and robe, with rich embroid'ry gay: Then unguents in a vase of gold supply, That breath'd a fragrance thro' the balmy sky. To them the King. No longer I detain Your friendly care: retire, ye virgin train! Retire, while from my weary'd limbs I lave The foul pollution of the briny wave: Ye Gods! since this worn frame refection knew, What scenes have I survey'd of dreadful view? But, nymphs, recede! sage chastity denies This place seems contradictory to the practice of Antiquity, and other passages in the Odyssey: Nothing is more frequent than for Heroes to make use of the ministry of damsels in bathing, as appears from Polycaste and Telemachus, &amp;c. Whence is it then that Ulysses commands the attendants of Nausicaa to withdraw while he bathes? Spondanus is of opinion, that the Poet intended to condemn an indecent custom of those ages solemnly by the mouth of so wise a person as Ulysses: but there is no other instance in all his works to confirm that conjecture. I am at a loss to give a better reason, unless the difference of the places might make an alteration in the action. It is possible that in baths prepared for publick use, there might be some convenience to defend the person who bath'd in some degree from observation, which might be wanting in an open river, so that the action might be more indecent in the one instance than in the other, and consequently occasion these words of Ulysses: But this is a conjecture, and submitted as such to the Reader's better judgment. To raise the blush, or pain the modest eyes. The nymphs withdrawn, at once into the tide It may be ask'd why Ulysses prefers the river-waters in washing, to the waters of the sea, in the Odyssey; whereas in the tenth book of the Iliad, after the death of Dolon, Diomed and Ulysses prefer the sea-waters to those of the river? There is a different reason for this different regimen: In the Iliad, Ulysses was fatigued, and sweated with the labours of the night, and in such a case the sea-waters being more rough are more purifying and corroborating: But here Ulysses comes from the seas, and (as Plutarch in his Symposiacs observes upon this passage,) the more subtle and light particles exhale by the heat of the sun, but the rough and saline stick to the body, 'till wash'd away by fresh waters. Active he bounds; the flashing waves divide: O'er all his limbs his hands the wave diffuse, And from his locks compress the weedy ooze; The balmy oil, a fragrant show'r, he sheds, Then drest in pomp magnificently treads. The warrior Goddess gives his frame to shine Poetry delights in the Marvellous, and ennobles the most ordinary subjects by dressing them with poetical ornaments, and giving them an adventitious dignity. The foundation of this fiction, of Ulysses receiving beauty from Pallas, is only this: The shipwreck and sufferings of Ulysses had changed his face and features, and his long fasting given him a pale and sorrowful aspect; but being bath'd, perfum'd, and dress'd in robes, he appears another man, full of life and beauty. This sudden change gave Homer the hint to improve it into a miracle; and he ascribes it to Minerva, to give a dignity to his Poetry. He further embellishes the description by a very happy comparison. Virgil has imitated it. Os humerosque Deo similis; namque ipsa decoram Cæsariem nato genetrix, lumenque juventæ Purpureum, &amp; lætos oculis afflârat honores. Quale manus addunt ebori decus, aut ubi flavo Argentum Pariusve lapis circumdatur auro. Scaliger, in the fifth book of his Poetics, prefers Virgil before Homer; and perhaps his opinion is just: Manus he says is more elegant than vir; and addunt ebori decus, than ???????? ?? ???? ???????. Os humerosque Deo similis, carries a nobler idea than Homer's ??????? ??? ???????; and above all, ? Lumenque juventæ Purpureum, &amp; lætos oculis afflarat honores. is inexpressibly beautiful. It is said that this image is made by the assistance of Vulcan and Minerva: Why by two Deities? Eustathius answers, the first rudiments and formation of it in the fire is proper to Vulcan, and Minerva is the president of arts; Minerva gives the Artificer Wisdom in designing, and Vulcan skill in labouring and finishing the work. With majesty enlarg'd, and air divine; Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls, His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls. As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives His skill divine, a breathing statue lives; By Pallas taught, he frames the wond'rous mold, And o'er the silver pours the fusile gold. So Pallas his heroic frame improves With heavenly bloom, and like a God he moves. A fragrance breathes around: majestic grace Attends his steps: th'astonish'd virgins gaze. Soft he reclines along the murm'ring seas, This little circumstance, Eustathius observes is not without its effect; the Poet withdraws Ulysses, to give Nausicaa an opportunity to speak freely in his praise without a breach of modesty: She speaks apart to her damsels, and by this conduct, Ulysses neither hears his own commendation, which is a pain to all worthy spirits, nor does Nausicaa betray an indecent sensibility, because she speaks only to her own sex and attendants. Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze. The wond'ring Nymph his glorious port survey'd, And to her damsels, with amazement, said. Not without Care divine the stranger treads This land of joy: his steps some Godhead leads: Would Jove destroy him, sure he had been driv'n Far from this realm, the fav'rite Isle of heav'n: Late a sad spectacle of woe, he trod The desart sands, and now he looks a God. Oh heav'n! in my connubial hour decree This passage has been censur'd as an outrage against Modesty and Credibility; Is it probable that a young Princess should fall in love with a stranger at the first sight? and if she really falls in love, is it not an indecent passion? I will lay before the Reader the observations of Plutarch upon it. “If Nausicaa, upon casting her eyes upon this stranger, and feeling such a passion for him as Calypso felt, talks thus out of wantonness, her conduct is blameable; but if perceiving his wisdom by his prudent address, she wishes for such an husband, rather than a person of her own country, who had no better qualifications than singing, dancing and dressing, she is to be commended.” This discovers no weakness, but prudence, and a true judgment. She deserves to be imitated by the fair sex, who ought to prefer a good understanding, before a fine coat, and a man of worth, before a good dancer. Besides, it may be offer'd in vindication of Nausicaa, that she had in the morning been assured by a vision from Heaven, that her nuptials were at hand; this might induce her to believe that Ulysses was the person intended by the vision for her husband; and his good sense and prudent behaviour, as Dacier observes, might make her wish it, without any imputation of immodesty. This man my spouse, or such a spouse as he! But haste, the viands and the bowl provide— The maids the viand, and the bowl supply'd: Eager he fed, for keen his hunger rag'd, And with the gen'rous vintage thirst asswag'd. Now on return her care Nausicaa bends, The robes resumes, the glittering car ascends, Far blooming o'er the field: and as she press'd The splendid seat, the list'ning chief address'd. Stranger arise! the sun rolls down the day, Lo, to the Palace I direct thy way: Where in high state the nobles of the land Attend my royal sire, a radiant band. But hear, tho' wisdom in thy soul presides, Speaks from thy tongue, and ev'ry action guides; Advance at distance, while I pass the plain Where o'er the furrows waves the golden grain: Alone I re-ascend—With airy mounds A strength of wall the guarded city bounds: The jutting land two ample bays divides; This passage is not without its difficulty: But the Scholiast upon Dionysius Perigetes gives us a full explication of it. ??? ??????? ???? ? ???????, ??? ??? ????????, ??? ?? ?(????, ???, ???? ?????????? ????????? ?????. The Island of Phæacia has two ports, the one called the port of Alcinous, the other of Hyllus; thus Callimachus calls it the place of two ports. And Apollonius for the same reason calls it ?????????, or the place which is enter'd by two ports. Dacier. Full thro' the narrow mouths descend the tides: The spacious basons arching rocks enclose, A sure defence from every storm that blows. Close to the bay great Neptune's fane adjoins; And near, a Forum flank'd with marble shines, Where the bold youth, the num'rous fleets to store, Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar; For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill, But the tall mast above the vessel rear, Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air; They rush into the deep with eager joy, It is very judicious in the Poet to let us thus fully into the character of the Phæacians, before he comes to show what relation they have to the story of the Odyssey: He describes Alcinous and the people of better rank, as persons of great hospitality and humanity, this gives an air of probability to the free and benevolent reception which Ulysses found: He describes the vulgar as excellent navigators; and he does this not only because they are Islanders; but, as Eustathius observes, to prepare the way for the return of Ulysses, who was to be restored by their conduct to his country, even against the inclination of Neptune, the God of the Ocean. But it may be ask'd, is not Homer inconsistent with himself, when he paints the Phæacians as men of the utmost humanity, and immediately after calls them a proud unpolish'd race; and given up to censoriousness? It is easy to reconcile the seeming contradiction, by applying the character of humanity to the higher rank of the nation, and the other to the vulgar and the mariners. I believe the same character holds good to this day amongst any people who are much addicted to sea-affairs; they contract a roughness, by being secluded from the more general converse of mankind, and consequently are strangers to that affability, which is the effect of a more enlarg'd conversation. But what is it that inclines the Phæacians to be censorious? It is to be remember'd, that they are every where describ'd as a people abandon'd to idleness; To idleness therefore that part of their character is to be imputed. When the thoughts are not employed upon things, it is usual to turn them upon persons: A good man has not the inclination, an industrious man not the leisure, to be censorious, so that censure is the property of idleness. This I take to be the moral, intended to be drawn from the character of the Phæacians. Climb the steep surge, and thro' the tempest fly; A proud, unpolish'd race—To me belongs The care to shun the blast of sland'rous tongues; Lest malice, prone the virtuous to defame, Thus with vile censure taint my spotless name. “What stranger this, whom thus Nausicaa leads? This is an instance of the great art of Homer, in saying every thing properly. Nausicaa had conceiv'd a great esteem for Ulysses, and she had an inclination to let him know it; but modesty forbad her to reveal it openly: How then shall Ulysses know the value she has for his person, consistently with the modesty of Nausicaa? Homer with great address puts her compliments into the mouth of the Phæacians, and by this method she speaks her own sentiments, as the sentiments of the Phæacians: Nausicaa, as it were, is withdrawn, and a whole nation introduced for a more general praise of Ulysses. “Heav'ns! with what graceful majesty he treads? “Perhaps a native of some distant shore, “The future Consort of her bridal hour; “Or rather, some descendant of the skies; Eustathius remarks, that the compliments of Nausicaa answer the compliments made to her by Ulysses: he resembled her to Diana, he him to the Gods. But it may be ask'd, are not both these extravagancies? and is it not beyond all credibility that Nausicaa should be thought a Goddess, or Ulysses a God? In these ages it would be judg'd extravagant, but it is to be remember'd that in the days of Homer every grove, river, fountain, and oak-tree were thought to have their peculiar Deities; this makes such relations as these more reconcilable, if not to truth, at least to the opinions of Antiquity, which is sufficient for Poetry. “Won by her pray'r, th'aerial bridegroom flies. “Heav'n on that hour its choicest influence shed, “That gave a sov'reign spouse to crown her bed! “All, all the god-like worthies that adorn “This realm, she flies: Phæacia is her scorn. And just the blame: for female innocence Not only flies the guilt, but shuns th'offence: Th'unguarded virgin as unchaste I blame, And the least freedom with the sex is shame, This is an admirable picture of ancient female life among the Orientals; the Virgins were very retir'd, and never appear'd amongst men but upon extraordinary occasions, and then always in the presence of the father or mother: But when they were married, says Eustathius, they had more liberty. Thus Helen converses freely with Telemachus and Pisistratus, and Penelope sometimes with the suitors. Nausicaa delivers her judgment sententiously, to give it more weight; what can be more modest than these expressions? And yet they have been greatly traduc'd by Monsieur Perrault, a French Critic; he translates the passage so as to imply that “Nausicaa disapproves of a Virgin's lying with a man without the permission of her father, before marriage;” ??????? ????????? led him into this mistake, which is sometimes used in such a signification, but here it only means Conversation: if the word ????????? signified more than keeping company, it would be more ridiculous, as Boileau observes upon Longinus, than Perrault makes it: for it is join'd to ???????, and then it would infer that Nausicaa disapproves of a young woman's lying with several men before she was married, without the licence of her father. The passage, continues Boileau, is full of honour and decency: Nausicaa has a design to introduce Ulysses to her father, she tells him she goes before to prepare the way for his reception, but that she must not be seen to enter the city in his company, for fear of giving offence, which a modest woman ought not to give: A virtuous woman is obliged not only to avoid immodesty, but the appearance of it; and for her part she could not approve of a young woman keeping company with men without the permission of her father or mother, before she was married. Thus the indecency is not in Homer, but the Critic: it is indeed in Homer an excellent lecture of Modesty and Morality. 'Till our consenting sires a spouse provide, And public nuptials justify the bride. But would'st thou soon review thy native plain? Eustathius and Dacier are both of opinion, that Nausicaa had conceiv'd a passion for Ulysses: I think this passage is an evidence that she rather admir'd and esteem'd, than lov'd him; for it is contrary to the nature of that passion to give directions for the departure of the person belov'd, but rather to invent excuses to prolong his stay. 'Tis true Nausicaa had wish'd in the foregoing parts of this book, that she might have Ulysses for her husband, or such an husband as Ulysses: but this only shews that she admir'd his accomplishments, nor could she have added such a spouse as he, at all, if her affections had been engag'd and fix'd upon Ulysses only. This likewise takes off the objection of a too great fondness in Nausicaa; for it might have appeared too great a fondness to have fall'n in love at the first with an absolute stranger. Attend, and speedy thou shalt pass the main: Nigh where a grove, with verdant poplars crown'd To Pallas sacred, shades the holy ground, We bend our way: a bubling fount distills A lucid lake, and thence descends in rills: Around the grove a mead with lively green Falls by degrees, and forms a beauteous scene; Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours; And there the garden yields a waste of flow'rs. Hence lies the town as far, as to the ear Floats a strong shout along the waves of air. There wait embowr'd, while I ascend alone To great Alcinous on his royal throne. Arriv'd, advance impatient of delay, And to the lofty palace bend thy way: The lofty palace overlooks the town, From ev'ry dome by pomp superior known; A child may point the way. With earnest gait Seek thou the Queen along the rooms of state; Her royal hand a wond'rous work designs, Around, a circle of bright damsels shines, Part twist the threads, and part the wool dispose, While with the purple orb the spindle glows. High on a throne, amid the Scherian pow'rs, My royal father shares the genial hours; But to the Queen thy mournful tale disclose; This little circumstance, seemingly of small importance, is not without its beauty. It is natural for a daughter to apply to the mother, rather than the father: Women are likewise generally of a compassionate nature, and therefore the Poet first interests the Queen in the cause of Ulysses. At the same time he gives a pattern of conjugal affection, in the union between Arete and Alcinous. With the prevailing eloquence of woes: So shalt thou view with joy thy natal shore, Tho' mountains rise between, and oceans roar. She added not, but waving as she wheel'd The silver scourge, it glitter'd o'er the field: With skill the virgin guides th'embroider'd rein, Slow rowls the car before th'attending train. Now whirling down the heav'ns, the golden day Shot thro' the western clouds a dewy ray; The grove they reach, where from the sacred shade To Pallas thus the pensive Heroe pray'd. Daughter of Jove! whose arms in thunder wield Th'avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield; Forsook by thee, in vain I sought thy aid When booming billows clos'd above my head: Attend, unconquer'd maid! accord my vows, Bid the Great hear, and pitying heal my woes. This heard Minerva, but forbore to fly We see the Ancients held a subordination amongst the Deities, and tho' different in inclinations, yet they act in harmony: One God resists not another Deity. This is more fully explain'd, as Eustathius observes, by Euripides, in his Hippolytus; where Diana says, it is not the custom of the Gods to resist one the other, when they take vengeance even upon the favourites of other Deities. The late tempest that Neptune had rais'd for the destruction of Ulysses, was an instance of Neptune's implacable anger: this makes Minerva take such measures as to avoid an open opposition, and yet consult the safety of Ulysses: She descends, but it is secretly. (By Neptune aw'd) apparent from the sky: Stern God! who rag'd with vengeance unrestrain'd, 'Till great Ulysses hail'd his native land. This book takes up part of the night, and the whole thirty second day; the vision of Nausicaa is related in the preceding night, and Ulysses enters the city a little after the Sun sets in the following evening. So that thirty two days are compleated since the opening of the Poem. This book in general is full of life and variety: It is true, the subject of it is simple and unadorn'd, but improved by the Poet, and render'd entertaining and noble. The Muse of Homer is like his Minerva, with respect to Ulysses, who from an object of commiseration improves his Majesty, and gives a grace to every feature. THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Court of Alcinous. The Princess Nausicaa returns to the city, and Ulysses soon after follows thither. He is met by Pallas in the form of a young Virgin, who guides him to the Palace, and directs him in what manner to address the Queen Arete. She then involves him in a mist, which causes him to pass invisible. The Palace and Gardens of Alcinous described. Ulysses falling at the feet of the Queen, the mist disperses, the Phæacians admire, and receive him with respect. The Queen enquiring by what means he had the garments he then wore, he relates to her and Alcinous his departure from Calypso, and his arrival on their dominions. The same day continues, and the book ends with the night. This book opens with the Introduction of Ulysses to Alcinous; every step the Poet takes carries on the main design of the Poem, with a progress so natural, that each incident seems really to have happen'd, and not to be invention. Thus Nausicaa accidentally meets Ulysses, and introduces him to Alcinous her father, who lands him in Ithaca: It is possible this might be true History; the Poet might build upon a real foundation, and only adorn the truth with the ornaments of Poetry. It is to be wish'd, that a faithful History of the Trojan war, and the voyages of Ulysses had been transmitted to posterity; it would have been the best comment upon the Iliad and Odyssey. We are not to look upon the Poems of Homer as meer romances, but as true stories, heighten'd and beautify'd by Poetry: Thus the Iliad is built upon a real dissention, that happen'd in a real war between Greece and Troy; and the Odyssey upon the real voyages of Ulysses, and the disorders that happen'd thro' his absence in his own country. Nay, it is not impossible but that many of those incidents that seem most extravagant in Homer, might have an appearing truth, and be justify'd by the opinions, and mistaken credulity of those ages. What is there in all Homer more seemingly extravagant, than the story of the race of the Cyclops, with one broad eye in their foreheads? and yet, as Sir Walter Raleigh very judiciously conjectures, this may be built upon a seeming truth: They were a people of Sicily remarkable for savageness and cruelty, and perhaps might in their wars make use of a headpiece or vizor, which had but one sight in it, and this might give occasion to sailors who coasted those shores to mistake the single sight of the vizor, for a broad eye in the forehead, especially when they before look'd upon them as monsters for their barbarity. I doubt not but we lose many beauties in Homer for want of a real history, and think him extravagant, when he only complies with the opinions of former ages. I thought it necessary to make this observation, as a general vindication of Homer; especially in this place, immediately before he enters upon the relation of those stories which have been thought most to outrage credibility: if then we look upon the Odyssey as all fiction, we consider it unworthily; it ought to be read as a story founded upon truth, but adorn'd with the embellishments of Poetry, to convey instruction with pleasure the more effectually. The patient, heav'nly man thus suppliant pray'd, While the slow mules draw on th'imperial maid: Thro' the proud street she moves, the publick gaze: The turning wheel before the Palace stays. With ready love her brothers gath'ring round, Receiv'd the vestures, and the mules unbound. She seeks the bridal bow'r: A matron there The rising fire supplies with busy care, Whose charms in youth her father's heart inflam'd, Now worn with age, Eurymedusa nam'd: Eustathius remarks, that the Phæacians were people of great commerce, and that it was customary in those ages to exchange slaves in traffic; or perhaps Eurymedusa might be a captive, pyracy then being honourable, and such seizures of cattle or slaves frequent. The passage concerning the brothers of Nausicaa has not escaped the censure of the Criticks; Homer in the original calls them like Gods, and yet in the same breath gives them the employment of slaves, they unyoke the Mules, and carry into the Palace the burthens they brought. A twofold answer may be given to this objection, and this conduct might proceed from the general custom of the age, which made such actions reputable; or from the particular love the brothers bore their sister, which might induce them to act thus, as an instance of it. The captive dame Phæacian rovers bore, Snatch'd from Epirus, her sweet native shore, (A grateful prize) and in her bloom bestow'd On good Alcinous, honour'd as a God: Nurse of Nausicaa from her infant years, And tender second to a mother's cares. Now from the sacred thicket where he lay, To town Ulysses took the winding way. Propitious Pallas, to secure her care, Around him spread a veil of thicken'd air; It may be ask'd what occasion there is to make Ulysses invisible? Eustathius answers, not only to preserve him from insults as he was a stranger, but that he might raise a greater surprize in Alcinous by his sudden appearance. But, adds he, the whole is an allegory; and Ulysses wisely chusing the evening to enter unobserv'd, gave occasion to the Poet to bring in the goddess of wisdom to make him invisible. Virgil has borrow'd this passage from Homer, and Venus renders Æneas invisible in the same manner as Minerva Ulysses. (Scaliger compares the two Authors, and prefers Virgil infinitely before Homer, in the fifth book of his Poetics. At Venus obscuro gradientes aere sepsit, Et multo nebulæ circum Dea fudit amictu; Cernere ne quis eos, neu quis contingere posset, Molirive moram, aut veniendi poscere causas. Scaliger says the verses are more sonorous than Homer's, and that it was more necessary to make Æneas invisible than Ulysses, he being amongst a perfidious nation. But was not the danger as great from the rudeness of the Phæacians, as from the perfidiousness of the Carthaginians? Besides, Virgil does not mention the perfidiousness of the Carthaginians; so that it is the reason of Scaliger, not Virgil: and whether the verses be more sonorous, is submitted to the ear of the Reader. He is chiefly delighted with Et multo nebulæ circum Dea fudit amictu. Qui solus versus, says he, deterreat Græcos ab ea sententiâ, quâ suum contendunt præferendum. He allows ????????? ?? ???????, &amp;c. to be a tolerable smooth verse, Commodus &amp; rasilis, but yet far inferior to this of Virgil. Molirive moram, &amp; veniendi poscere causas. It is but justice to lay the verses of Homer before the Reader. ??? ???? ???????? ???? ????? ?? ????, ???? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ???? ???? ????????)/ ??????. ????? ??????? ????????? ???????????, ????????? ?? ???????, ??? ????????? ???? ???. I determine not which author has the greater beauty, but undoubtedly Homer is more happy in the occasion of the fiction than Virgil; Homer drew his description from the wisdom of Ulysses in entering the town in the evening, he was really invisible to the Phæacians, and Homer only heighten'd the truth by Poetry; but Virgil is more bold, and has no such circumstance to justify his relation; for Æneas went into Carthage in the open day. To shun th'encounter of the vulgar crowd, Insulting still, inquisitive, and loud. When near the fam'd Phæacian walls he drew, The beauteous city opening to his view, His step a Virgin met, and stood before: A polish'd Urn the seeming Virgin bore, It may be ask'd why Minerva does not appear as a Goddess, but in a borrow'd form? The Poet has already told us, that she dreaded the wrath of Neptune; one Deity could not openly oppose another Deity, and therefore she acts thus invisibly. And youthful smil'd; but in the low disguise Lay hid the Goddess with the azure eyes. Show me, fair daughter, (thus the chief demands) The house of him who rules these happy lands. Thro' many woes and wand'rings, lo! I come To good Alcinous' hospitable dome. Far from my native coast, I rove alone, A wretched stranger, and of all unknown! The Goddess answer'd. Father, I obey, And point the wand'ring traveller his way: Well known to me the palace you enquire, For fast beside it dwells my honour'd sire, But silent march, nor greet the common train With question needless, or enquiry vain. A race of rugged mariners are these; Unpolish'd men, and boistrous as their seas: The native Islanders alone their care, And hateful he that breathes a foreign air. These did the ruler of the deep ordain To build proud navies, and command the main; On canvas wings to cut the wat'ry way; This circumstance is not inserted without a good effect: It could not but greatly encourage Ulysses to understand that he was arriv'd amongst a people that excell'd in navigation; this gave him a prospect of being speedily convey'd to his own country, by the assistance of a nation so expert in maritime affairs. Eustathius. No bird so light, no thought so swift as they. Thus having spoke, th'unknown celestial leads: The footsteps of the Deity he treads, And secret moves along the crowded space, Unseen of all the rude Phæacian race. (So Pallas order'd, Pallas to their eyes The mist objected, and condens'd the skies) The chief with wonder sees th'extended streets, Scaliger in his Poeticks calls this an impertinent repetition, and commends Virgil for not imitating it, for Homer dwells upon it no less than three times; and indeed one would almost imagine that Virgil was of the same opinion, for he has follow'd the turn of this whole passage, and omitted this repetition: yet he treads almost step by step in the path of Homer, and Æneas and Ulysses are drawn in the same colours; Miratur molem Æneas, magalia quondam: Miratur portas. strepitumque &amp; strata viarum. ???????? ?? ??????? ???????, ??? ???? ?????, ??????? ????? ??????, ??? ?????? ?????, ?????, ??????????? ???????. Homer poetically inserts the Topography of this city of the Phæacians: Tho' they were an unwarlike nation, yet they understand the art of fortification; their city is surrounded with a strong wall, and that wall guarded with palisades. But whence this caution, since Homer tells us in the preceding book, that they were in no danger of an enemy? It might arise from their very fears, which naturally suggest to cowards, that they cannot be too safe; this would make them practise the art of Fortification more assiduously than a more brave people, who usually put more confidence in valour than in walls, as was the practice of the Spartans. The spreading harbours, and the riding fleets; He next their princes lofty domes admires, In sep'rate Islands crown'd with rising spires; And deep intrenchments, and high walls of stone, That gird the city like a marble zone. At length the kingly palace gates he view'd: There stopp'd the Goddess, and her speech renew'd. My task is done; the mansion you enquire Appears before you: enter, and admire. High-thron'd, and feasting, there thou shalt behold As Deities ought not to be introduced without a necessity, so, when introduced, they ought to be employed in acts of importance, and worthy of their divinity: It may be ask'd if Homer observes this rule in this Episode, where a Goddess seems to appear only to direct Ulysses to the Palace of Alcinous, which, as he himself tells us, a child could have done? But the chief design of Minerva was to advise Ulysses in his present exigencies: and (as Eustathius remarks) she opens her speech to him with great and noble sentiments. She informs him how to win the favour of Alcinous, upon which depends the whole happiness of her Heroe; and by which she brings about his re-establishment in his kingdom, the aim of the whole Odyssey. Virgil makes use of the same method in his Æneis, and Venus there executes the same office for her son, as Minerva for her favourite, in some degree as a Guide, but chiefly as a Counsellor. The sceptred Rulers. Fear not, but be bold: A decent boldness ever meets with friends, Succeeds, and ev'n a stranger recommends. First to the Queen prefer a suppliant's claim, Alcinous' Queen, Arete is her name, The same her parents, and her pow'r the same. For know, from Ocean's God Nausithous sprung, And Peribæa, beautiful and young: (Eurymedon's last hope, who rul'd of old This passage is worthy of observation, as it discovers to us the time when the race of the ancient Giants perish'd; this Eurymedon was grandfather to Nausithous, the father of Alcinous; so that the Giants were extirpated forty or fifty years before the war of Troy. This exactly agrees with ancient story, which informs us, that Hercules and Theseus purg'd the earth from those monsters. Plutarch in his life of Theseus tells us, that they were men of great strength, and public robbers, one of whom was called the Bender of Pines. Now Theseus stole away Helen in her infancy, and consequently these Giants were destroy'd some years before the Trojan expedition. Dacier, Plutarch. The race of Giants, impious, proud and bold; Perish'd the nation in unrighteous war, Perish'd the Prince, and left this only heir.) Who now by Neptune's am'rous pow'r comprest, Produc'd a Monarch that his people blest, Father and Prince of the Phæacian name: From him Rhexenor and Alcinous came. The first by Phœbus' burning arrows fir'd, New from his nuptials, hapless youth! expir'd. No son surviv'd: Arete heir'd his state, It is observable that this Arete was both wife and niece to Alcinous, an instance that the Græcians married with such near relations: The same appears from Demosthenes and other Greek Orators. But what then is the notion of incest amongst the Ancients? The collateral branch was not thought incestuous, for Juno was the wife and sister of Jupiter. Brothers likewise married their brother's wives, as Deiphobus Helen, after the death of Paris: the same was practis'd amongst the Jews, and consequently being permitted by Moses was not incestuous. So that the only incest was in the ascending, not collateral or descending branch; as when parents and children married; thus when Myrrha lay with her father, and Lot with his daughters, this was accounted incest. The reason is very evident, a child cannot pay the duty of a child to a parent, and at the same time of a wife or husband; nor can a father act with the authority of a father towards a person who is at once his wife and daughter. The relations interfere, and introduce confusion, where the law of nature and reason requires regularity. And her, Alcinous chose his royal mate. With honours yet to womankind unknown, This Queen he graces, and divides the throne; In equal tenderness her sons conspire, And all the children emulate their sire. When thro' the street she gracious deigns to move, (The publick wonder, and the publick love) The tongues of all with transport sound her praise, The eyes of all, as on a Goddess, gaze. She feels the triumph of a gen'rous breast; To heal divisions, to relieve th'opprest; This office of Arete has been look'd upon as somewhat extraordinary, that she should decide the quarrels of the subjects, a province more proper for Alcinous; and therefore the Ancients endeavour'd to soften it by different readings; and instead of ????? ?? ?????????, they inserted ???? ?? ???????????, or she decides amongst women. Eustathius in the text reads it in a third way, ???? ?? ???????????, or by her wisdom. Spondanus believes, that the Queen had a share in the government of the Phæacians; but Eustathius thinks the Poet intended to set the character of Arete in a fair point of light, she bearing the chief part in this book, and a great share in the sequel of the Odyssey: by this method he introduces her to the best advantage, and makes her a person of importance, and worthy to have a place in heroic Poetry; and indeed he has given her a very amiable character. In virtue rich; in blessing others, blest. Go then secure, thy humble suit prefer, And owe thy country and thy friends to her. With that the Goddess deign'd no longer stay, But o'er the world of waters wing'd her way: Forsaking Scheria's ever-pleasing shore, The winds to Marathon the Virgin bore; Thence, where proud Athens rears her tow'ry head, With opening streets and shining structures spread, She past, delighted with the well-known seats; And to Erectheus' sacred dome retreats. Mean-while Ulysses at the Palace waits, There stops, and anxious with his soul debates, Fix'd in amaze before the royal gates. The Poet here opens a very agreeable scene, and describes the beauty of the Palace and Gardens of Alcinous. Diodorus Siculus adapts this passage to the Island Taprobane, Justin Martin to Paradise; ??? ?????????? ?? ?????? ??? ???????? ????? ??????. He transcribes this whole passage into his Apology, but with some variation from the common Editions, for instead of ? ???? ???? ???? ??????? ????????,? he reads ????? ??? ???? ???????, &amp;c. perhaps more elegantly. Eustathius observes that Homer suits his Poetry to the things he relates, for in the whole Iliad there is not a description of this nature, nor an opportunity to introduce it in a Poem that represents nothing but objects of terror and blood. The Poet himself seems to go a little out of the way to bring it into the Odyssey; for it has no necessary connection with the Poem, nor would it be less perfect if it had been omitted: but as Mercury, when he survey'd the bower of Calypso, ravish'd with the beauty of it, stood a while in a still admiration, so Homer, delighted with the scenes he draws, stands still a few moments, and suspends the story of the Poem, to enjoy the beauties of these gardens of Alcinous. But even here he shews his judgment, in not letting his fancy run out into a long description: He concludes the whole in the compass of twenty verses, and resumes the thread of his story. Rapine, I confess, censures this description of the gardens: he calls it Puerile and too light for Eloquence, that it is spun out to too great a length, and is somewhat affected, has no due coherence with, nor bears a just proportion to the whole, by reason of its being too glittering. This is spoken with too great severity: it is necessary to relieve the mind of the reader sometimes with gayer scenes, that it may proceed with a fresh appetite to the succeeding entertainment: In short, if it be a fault, it is a beautiful fault; and Homer may be said here, as he was upon another occasion by St. Augustin, to be dulcissimè vanus. The admiration of the gold and silver is no blemish to Ulysses: for, as Eustathius remarks, it proceeds not out of avarice, but from the beauty of the work, and usefulness and magnificence of the buildings. The whole description, continues he, suits the character of the Phæacians, a proud, luxurious people, delighted with shew and ostentation. The front appear'd with radiant splendors gay, Bright as the lamp of night, or orb of day. The walls were massy brass: the cornice high Blue metals crown'd, in colours of the sky: Rich plates of gold the folding doors incase; The pillars silver, on a brazen base; Silver the lintels deep-projecting o'er, And gold, the ringlets that command the door. Two rows of stately dogs, on either hand, We have already seen that dogs were kept as a piece of state, from the instance of those that attended Telemachus: Here Alcinous has images of dogs in gold, for the ornament of his palace; Homer animates them in his Poetry; but to soften the description, he introduces Vulcan, and ascribes the Wonder to the power of a God. If we take the poetical dress away, the truth is, that these dogs were form'd with such excellent art, that they seem'd to be alive, and Homer by a liberty allowable to Poetry describes them as really having that life, which they only have in appearance. In the Iliad he speaks of living Tripods with greater boldness. Eustathius recites another opinion of some of the Ancients, who thought these ????? not to be animals, but a kind of large nails (?(/????) or iron pins, made use of in buildings, and to this day the name is retain'd by builders, as Dogs of iron, &amp;c. It is certain the words will bear this interpretation, but the former is more after the spirit of Homer, and more noble in Poetry. Besides, if the latter were intended, it would be absurd to ascribe a work of so little importance to a Deity. In sculptur'd gold and labour'd silver stand. These Vulcan form'd with art divine, to wait Immortal guardians at Alcinous' gate; Alive each animated frame appears, And still to live, beyond the pow'r of years. Fair thrones within from space to space were rais'd, The Poet does not say of what materials these thrones were made, whether of gold or silver, to avoid the imputation of being thought fabulous in his description; it being almost incredible, remarks Eustathius, that such quantities of gold and silver could be in the possession of such a King as Alcinous; tho', if we consider that his people were greatly given to navigation, the relation may come within the bounds of credibility. Where various carpets with embroidry blaz'd, The work of matrons: These the Princes prest, Day following day, a long-continu'd feast. Refulgent pedestals the walls surround, This is a remarkable piece of grandeur: Lamps, as appears from the 18?? of the Odyssey, were not at this time known to the Grecians, but only Torches; these were held by Images in the shape of beautiful youths, and those Images were of gold. Lucretius has translated these verses. —Aurea sunt juvenum simulacra per ædeis, Lampadas igniferas manibus retinentia dextris, Lumina nocturnis epulis ut suppeditentur. It is admirable to observe with what propriety Homer adapts his Poetry to the characters of his persons: Nestor is a wise man; when he is first seen in the Odyssey, it is at a sacrifice, and there is not the least appearance of pomp or luxury in his palace or entertainments. The Phæacians are of an opposite character, and the Poet describes them consistently with it; they are all along a proud, idle, effeminate people; tho' such a pompous description would have ill suited the wise Nestor, it excellently agrees with the vain Alcinous. Which boys of gold with flaming torches crown'd; The polish'd Ore, reflecting ev'ry ray, Blaz'd on the banquets with a double day. Full fifty handmaids from the houshold train; Some turn the mill, or sift the golden grain, Some ply the loom; their busy fingers move Like poplar-leaves when Zephyr fans the grove. There is some obscurity in this short allusion, and some refer it to the work, others to the damsels employ'd in work: Eustathius is of the opinion that it alludes to the damsels, and expresses the quick and continued motion of their hands: I have follow'd this interpretation, and think that Homer intended to illustrate that quick and intermingled motion, by comparing them to the branches of a Poplar agitated by winds, all at once in motion, some bending this, some that way. The other interpretations are more forc'd, and less intelligible. Not more renown'd the men of Scheria's Isle, For sailing arts and all the naval toil, ????????? ?? ????/??? ??????????? ????? ??????. This passage is not without difficulty: some of the ancients understood it to signify the thickness and closeness of the texture, which was so compactly wrought that Oil could not penetrate it; others thought it expressed the smoothness and softness of it, as if Oil seem'd to flow from it; or lastly, that it shone with such a glossy colour as look'd like Oil. Dacier renders the verse according to the opinion first recited. So close the work, that oil diffus'd in vain, Glides off innoxious and without a stain. Any of these interpretations make the passage intelligible, (tho' I think the description does better without it.) It is left to the judgment of the Reader which to prefer; they are all to be found in Eustathius. Than works of female skill their women's pride, We may gather from what Homer here relates concerning the skill of these Phæacian damsels, that they were fam'd for these works of curiosity: The Corcyrians were much given to traffic, and perhaps they might bring slaves from the Sidonians, who instructed them in these manufactures. Dacier. The flying shuttle thro' the threads to guide: Pallas to these her double gifts imparts, Inventive genius, and industrious arts. Close to the gates a spacious Garden lies, This famous Garden of Alcinous contains no more than four acres of ground, which in those times of simplicity was thought a large one even for a Prince. It is laid out, as Eustathius observes, into three parts: a grove for fruits and shade, a vineyard, and an allotment for olives and herbs. It is water'd with two fountains, the one supplies the palace and town, the other the garden and the flowers. But it may be ask'd what reality there is in the relation, and whether any trees bear fruit all the year in this Island? Eustathius observes, that experience teaches the contrary, and that it is only true of the greatest part of the year; Homer, adds he, disguises the true situation of the Phæacians, and here describes it as one of the happy Islands; at once to enrich his Poetry, and to avoid a discovery of his Poetical exaggeration. The relation is true of other places, if Pliny and Theophrastus deserve credit, as Dacier observes; thus the Citron bears during the whole year fruits and flowers. Arbos ipsa omnibus horis pomifera, aliis cadentibus, aliis maturescentibus, aliis vero subnascentibus. The same is related of other trees by Pliny: Novnsque fructus in his cum Annotino pendet; he affirms the like of the Pine, habet fructum maturescentum, habet proximo anno ad maturitatem venturum, ac deinde tertio, &amp;c. So that what Homer relates is in it self true, tho' not entirely of Phæacia. Or perhaps it might be only intended for a more beautiful and poetical manner of describing the constant succession of one after another in a fertile climate. —Figs on figs arise. Aristotle apply'd this Hemistic scoffingly to the sycophants of Athens: he was about to leave that city upon its rejoicing at the death of Socrates; and, quoting this verse, he said he would not live in a place where ? ???????? ????? ?? ??? ????. alluding to the derivation of the word Sycophant. Eustathius. Some dry the black'ning clusters in the sun. To understand this passage aright, it is necessary to know the manner of ordering the vintage amongst the Greeks: First, they carried all the grapes they gather'd into an house for a season; afterwards they exposed them ten days to the sun, and let them lye abroad as many nights in the freshness of the air; then they kept them five days in cool shades, and on the sixth they trod them, and put the wine into vessels: This we learn from Hesiod: ?????, verse 227. ? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ????????, ???? ?? ??? ???? ??????? ???? ???????? ?????????? ? Homer distinguishes the whole into three orders: First, the grapes that have already been expos'd to the sun are trod; the second order is of the grapes that are exposed, while the others are treading; and the third, of those that are ripe to be gather'd, while the others are thus ordering. Homer himself thus explains it, by saying, that while some vines were loaded with black and mature grapes, others were green, or but just turning to blackness. Homer undoubtedly founds this poetical relation upon observing some vines that bore fruit thrice annually. Pliny affirms this to be true, lib. 16. cap. 27. Vites quidem &amp; triferæ sunt, quas ob id insanas vocant, quoniam in iis aliæ maturescunt, aliæ turgescunt, aliæ florent. Dacier. From storms defended, and inclement skies: Four acres was th'allotted space of ground, Fenc'd with a green enclosure all around. Tall thriving trees confess'd the fruitful mold; The red'ning apple ripens here to gold. Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows, With deeper red the full pomegranate glows, The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear, And verdant olives flourish round the year. The balmy spirit of the western gale Eternal breathes on fruits untaught to fail: Each dropping pear a following pear supplies, On apples apples, figs on figs arise: The same mild season gives the blooms to blow, The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow. Here order'd vines in equal ranks appear, With all th'united labours of the year; Some to unload with fertile branches run, Some dry the black'ning clusters in the sun, Others to tread the liquid harvest join, The groaning presses foam with floods of wine. Here are the vines in early flow'r descry'd, Here grapes discolour'd on the sunny side, And there in autumn's richest purple dy'd. Beds of all various herbs, for ever green, In beauteous order terminate the scene. Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crown'd; This thro' the gardens leads its streams around, Visits each plant, and waters all the ground: While that in pipes beneath the palace flows, And thence its current on the town bestows; To various use their various streams they bring, The People one, and one supplies the King. Such were the glories which the Gods ordain'd To grace Alcinous, and his happy land. Ev'n from the Chief, who men and nations knew, Th'unwonted scene surprize and rapture drew; In pleasing thought he ran the prospect o'er, Then hasty enter'd at the lofty door. Night now approaching, in the palace stand With goblets crown'd, the Rulers of the land; Prepar'd for rest, and off'ring to the Mercury. God I have already explain'd from Athenæus this custom of offering to Mercury at the conclusion of entertainments: he was thought by the Ancients to preside over sleep: dat somnos adimitque, according to Horace, as Dacier observes: In following ages this practice was alter'd, and they offer'd not to Mercury, but to Jove the Perfecter, or to ???? ??????? Who bears the virtue of the sleepy rod. Unseen he glided thro' the joyous crowd, With darkness circled, and an ambient cloud. Direct to great Alcinous' throne he came, And prostrate fell before th'Imperial dame. Then from around him drop'd the veil of night; If this whole story of the veil of air had been told simply and nakedly, it would imply no more than that Ulysses arriv'd without being discover'd; and the breaking of the veil denotes his first coming into sight, in the presence of the Queen. But Homer steps out of the vulgar road of an Historian, and cloaths it with a sublimity worthy of heroic Poetry. In the same manner Virgil discovers his Æneas to Dido; ? Cum circumsusa repente Scindit se nubes, &amp; in aera purgat opertum. Scaliger prefers these verses to those of Homer, and perhaps with good reason; he calls the last part of the second verse a divine addition; and indeed it is far more beautiful than the ???????? ??? of Homer. Sudden he shines, and manifest to sight. The Nobles gaze, with awful fear opprest; Silent they gaze, and eye the god-like guest. Daughter of great Rhexenor! (thus began Low at her knees, the much-enduring man) To thee, thy consort, and this royal train, Minerva commanded Ulysses to supplicate the Queen: Why then does he exceed the directions of the Goddess, and not only address himself to Alcinous, but to the rest of the assembly? Spondanus answers, that Ulysses adapts himself to the present circumstances, and seeing the King and other Peers in the same assembly, he thought it improper not to take notice of them: he therefore addresses himself to all, that he may make all his friends. But then does not Minerva give improper directions? and is not Ulysses more wise than the Goddess of Wisdom? The true reason therefore may perhaps be, that Ulysses really complies with the injunctions of the Goddess: she commands him to address himself to the Queen; and he does so: this I take to mean chiefly or primarily, but not exclusively to the King: If the passage be thus understood, it solves the objection. To all that share the blessings of your reign, A suppliant bends: oh pity human woe! 'Tis what the happy to th'unhappy owe. A wretched exile to his country send, Ulysses here speaks very concisely; and he may seem to break abruptly into the subject of his petition, without letting the audience either into the knowledge of his condition or person. Was this a proper method to prevail over an assembly of strangers? But his gesture spoke for him, he threw himself into the posture of a suppliant, and the persons of all suppliants were esteem'd to be sacred: He declar'd himself to be a man in calamity, and reserves his story to be told more at large, when the surprize of the Phæacians at the sudden appearance of a stranger was over: this conciseness therefore is not blameable, but rather an instance of Homer's judgment, who knows when to be short, and when to be copious. Long worn with griefs, and long without a friend. So may the Gods your better days increase, And all your joys descend on all your race, So reign for ever on your country's breast, Your people blessing, by your people blest! Then to the genial hearth he bow'd his face, And humbled in the ashes took his place. This was the custom of Suppliants: they betook themselves to the hearth as sacred, and a place of refuge. It was particularly in the protection of Vesta: Thus Tully, lib. 2. de Naturâ Deorum; Nomen Vestæ sumptum est a Græcis, ea est enim quæ illis ????? dicitur, jusque ejus ad aras, &amp; focos pertines. Apollonius likewise, as Spondanus observes, takes notice of this custom of Suppliants. ?? ?? ????, ??? ??????? ??? ????? ???????? ??????, ??? ???? ??????? ??????? ????????. That is, they betook themselves to the hearth, and there sate mute, which is the custom of all unhappy suppliants. If it was a custom, as Apollonius observes, to sit mute, this gives another reason why Ulysses used but few words in his supplication: he had greatly outrag'd a practice that was establish'd as sacred amongst the Greeks, and had not acted in the character of a Suppliant, if he had launch'd out into a long oration. This was the most sure and effectual way of supplication; thus when Themistocles fled to Admetus King of the Molossians, he placed himself before the hearth, and was receiv'd, tho' that King had formerly vow'd his destruction. Plutarch indeed calls it an unusual way of supplication, but that proceeded from his carrying a child in his arms to move the greater compassion, not from his throwing himself into the protection of the Household-Gods. Silence ensu'd. The eldest first began, Echeneus sage, a venerable man! The expression in the original, as Dacier observes, is remarkable: Echeneus an old man, who knew many ancient, and great variety of things; he was wise by long experience, and by being conversant in ancient story: The Author of the book of Wisdom speaks almost in the same expressions: Scit præterita &amp; de futuris æstimat. Whose well-taught mind the present age surpast, And join'd to that th'experience of the last. Fit words attended on his weighty sense, And mild persuasion flow'd in eloquence. Oh sight (he cry'd) dishonest and unjust! A guest, a stranger, seated in the dust! To raise the lowly suppliant from the ground Befits a Monarch. Lo! the Peers around But wait thy word, the gentle guest to grace And seat him fair in some distinguish'd place. Let first the herald due libation pay To Jove, who guides the wand'rer on his way; Then set the genial banquet in his view, And give the stranger-guest a stranger's due. His sage advice the list'ning King obeys, He stretch'd his hand the prudent chief to raise, And from his seat Laodamas remov'd, Plutarch in his Symposiacs discusses a question, whether the Master of the feast should place his guests, or let them seat themselves promiscuously: He there commends this conduct of Alcinous, as an instance of a courteous disposition and great humanity, who gave a place of dignity to a stranger and suppliant. (The monarch's offspring, and his best belov'd) There next his side the god-like hero sate; With stars of silver shone the bed of state. The golden ew'r a beauteous handmaid brings, Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs, Whose polish'd vase with copious streams supplies A silver laver, of capacious size. The table next in regal order spread, The glitt'ring canisters are heap'd with bread: Viands of various kinds invite the taste, Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast! Thus feasting high, Alcinous gave the sign And bad the herald pour the rosy wine. Let all around the due libation pay We have already seen that the whole assembly was about to pour libations to Mercury, whence is it then that they now offer to Jupiter? Eustathius observes, it was because of the arrival of this stranger, and Jupiter presides over all strangers, and is frequently stil'd ???? ?????? and ???? ?????????. To Jove, who guides the wand'rer on his way. He said. Pontonous heard the King's command; The circling goblet moves from hand to hand: Each drinks the juice that glads the heart of man. Alcinous then, with aspect mild, began. Princes and Peers, attend! while we impart To you, the thoughts of no inhuman heart. Now pleas'd and satiate from the social rite Repair we to the blessings of the night: But with the rising day, assembled here, Let all the Elders of the land appear, Pious observe our hospitable laws, And heav'n propitiate in the stranger's cause: Then join'd in council, proper means explore Safe to transport him to the wish'd-for shore: (How distant that, imports not us to know, Nor weigh the labour, but relieve the woe) Mean-time, nor harm nor anguish let him bear; This interval, Heav'n trusts him to our care, But to his native land our charge resign'd, Heav'n is his life to come, and all the woes behind. Then must he suffer what the Fates ordain; For Fate has wove the thread of life with pain, And twins ev'n from the birth, are misery and man! But if descended from th'Olympian bow'r, Gracious approach us some immortal pow'r; If in that form thou com'st a guest divine: Some high event the conscious Gods design. As yet, unbid they never grac'd our feast, The solemn sacrifice call'd down the guest; Then manifest of heav'n the vision stood, And to our eyes familiar was the God. Oft with some favour'd traveller they stray, And shine before him all the desart way: With social intercourse, and face to face, The friends and guardians of our pious race. So near approach we their celestial kind, By justice, truth, and probity of mind; As our dire neighbours of Cyclopean birth Match in fierce wrong, the Giant-sons of earth. Let no such thought (with modest grace rejoin'd The prudent Greek) possess the royal mind. Alas! a mortal, like thy self, am I; No glorious native of yon azure sky: In form, ah how unlike their heav'nly kind? How more inferior in the gifts of mind? Alas, a mortal! most opprest of those There is some intricacy in this passage, and much labor has been used to explain it. Some would have it to imply, that “we are as nearly ally'd to the Gods, as the Cyclops and Giants, who are descended from them; and if the Gods frequently appear to these Giants who defy them; how much more may it be expected by the Phæacians to enjoy that favour, who reverence and adore them?” Eustathius explains it after another method; Alcinous had conceiv'd a fix'd hatred against the race of the Cyclops, who had expell'd the Phæacians from their country, and forc'd them to seek a new habitation; he here expresses that hatred, and says, that the Phæacians resemble the Gods as much in goodness, as the Cyclops and Giants one the other in impiety: He illustrates it, by shewing that the expression has the same import as if we should say that Socrates comes as near to Plato in virtue, as Anytus and Melitus to one another in wickedness; and indeed the construction will be easy, by understanding '???????? in the second verse. ? ?????? ??????? ?????, ????? ???????? ??? ????? ???? ????????, Subaudi, ??????? ???????? ??? ??. I have already spoken of the presence of the Gods at the sacrifices, in a former note upon the Odyssey: This frequent intercourse of the Gods was agreeable to the Theology of the Ancients; but why then is Alcinous surpriz'd at the appearance of Ulysses, whom he looks upon as a God, if such favours were frequent? Spondanus replies, that it is the unusualness of the time, not the appearance, that surprizes Alcinous; the Gods appear'd either at their sacrifices, or in their journeys, and therefore he looks upon this visit as a thing extraordinary. Whom Fate has loaded with a weight of woes; By a sad train of miseries alone Distinguish'd long, and second now to none! By heav'n's high will compell'd from shore to shore; With heav'n's high will prepar'd to suffer more. What histories of toil could I declare? But still long-weary'd nature wants repair; Spent with fatigue, and shrunk with pining fast, My craving bowels still require repast. Howe'er the noble, suff'ring mind, may grieve Its load of anguish, and disdain to live; Necessity demands our daily bread; Hunger is insolent, and will be fed. But finish, oh ye Peers! what you propose, And let the morrow's dawn conclude my woes. Pleas'd will I suffer all the Gods ordain, To see my soil, my son, my friends, again. That view vouchsaf'd, let instant death surprise It is very necessary to recall frequently to the reader's mind the desire Ulysses has to reach his own country; and to shew that he is absent not by choice, but necessity, all the disorders in his kingdoms happen by reason of his absence: it is therefore necessary to set the desire of his return in the strongest point of light, that he may not seem accessary to those disorders, by being absent when it was in his power to return. It is observable that Ulysses does not here make any mention of Penelope, whom he scarce ever omits in other places, as one of the chief inducements to wish for his country; the reason of his silence, says Eustathius, is, because he is unwilling to abate the favour of Alcinous, by a discovery that would shew it was impossible for him to marry his daughter; such a discovery might make the King proceed more cooly towards his transportation; whereas it would afterwards be less dangerous, when he has had an opportunity fully to engage him in his favour. With ever-during shade these happy eyes! Th'assembled Peers with gen'ral praise approv'd His pleaded reason, and the suit he mov'd. Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares, And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs. Ulysses in the regal walls alone Remain'd: Beside him, on a splendid throne, Divine Arete and Alcinous shone. The Queen, on nearer view, the guest survey'd Rob'd in the garments her own hands had made; Not without wonder seen. Then thus began, Her words addressing to the god-like man. Cam'st thou not hither, wond'rous stranger! say, From lands remote, and o'er a length of sea? Tell then whence art thou? whence that Princely air? And robes like these, so recent and so fair? Hard is the task, oh Princess! you impose: Æneas in Virgil speaks to Venus after the same manner, as Ulysses to Arete. O Dea, si primâ repetens ab origine pergam, Et vacet annales nostrorum audire laboram, Ante diem clauso componet vesper Olympo. Scaliger observes that Virgil so far exceeds the verses of Homer, that they will not even bear a comparison; he is superior almost in every word: for instance; he renders ?????????, by primâ ab origine, and adds the word vacet beautifully; and still more beautifully he translates ????? ?????, annales nostrorum audire laborum; and lastly he paraphrases the word ???????? by a most harmonious line, Ante diem clauso componet vesper Olympo. which excellently describes the multitude of the sufferings of Æneas, which could not be comprehended in the relation of a whole day. I will not deny but that Virgil excels Homer in this and many other passages which he borrows from him: but then is it a just conclusion to infer, after the manner of Scaliger, that Virgil is a better Poet than Homer? To conclude from particulars to generals is a false way of arguing. It is as if in a comparison of two persons, a man should from single features give a superiority of beauty, which is only to be gather'd from the symmetry of the whole body. (Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes) The long, the mournful series to relate Of all my sorrows, sent by heav'n and fate! Yet what you ask, attend. An Island lies Homer here gives a summary of the subject of the two preceding books: this recapitulation cannot indeed be avoided, because it is necessary to let Alcinous into his story, and this cannot be done without a repetition; but generally all repetitions are tedious: The Reader is offended when that is related which he knows already, he receives no new instruction to entertain his judgment, nor any new descriptions to excite his curiosity, and by these means the very soul of Poetry is extinguish'd, and it becomes unspirited and lifeless. When therefore repetitions are absolutely necessary, they ought always to be short; and I may appeal to the Reader if he is not tir'd with many in Homer, especially when made in the very same words? Here indeed Ulysses tells his story but in part; the Queen ask'd him who he was, but he passes over this without any reply, and reserves the greatest part of his story to a time of more leisure, that he may discover himself to a better advantage before the whole Peerage of the Phæacians. I do not always condemn even the verbal repetitions of Homer, sometimes as in embassies they may be necessary, because every word is stamp'd with authority, and perhaps they might be customary in Homer's times; if they were not, he had too fruitful an invention not to have varied his thoughts and expressions. Bossu observes, that with respect to repetitions Virgil is more exact than Homer; for instance, in the first book of the Æneis, when Æneas is repeating his sufferings to Venus, she interrupts him to give him comfort; ? Nec plura querentem Passa Venus, medio sic interfata dolore est. and in the third book, where good manners oblig'd this Heroe to relate his story at the request of Andromache, the Poet prevents it by introducing Helenus, who hinders the repetition. Beyond these tracts, and under other skies, Ogygia nam'd, in Ocean's wat'ry arms: Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms! Remote from Gods or men she holds her reign, Homer has the secret art of introducing the best instructions, in the midst of the plainest narrations. He has describ'd the unworthy passion of the Goddess Calypso, and the indecent advances she made to detain him from his country. It is possible this relation might make some impressions upon the mind of the Reader, inconsistent with exact Morality; What antidote then does Homer administer to expell this poison? He does not content himself with setting the chastity of Penelope in opposition to the loose desires of Calypso, and shewing the great advantage the Mortal has over the Goddess; but he here discovers the fountain from whence this weakness rises, by saying, that neither man nor Gods frequented this Island: on one hand the absence of the Gods, and on the other the infrequency of objects made her yield at the sight of the first that appears. Every object is dangerous in solitude, especially, as Homer expresses it, if we have no commerce with the Gods. Dacier. Amid the terrors of the rowling main. Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore: When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps Launch'd his red lightning at our scatter'd ships: Then, all my fleet, and all my foll'wers lost, Sole on a plank, on boiling surges tost, Heav'n drove my wreck th'Ogygian Isle to find, Full nine days floating to the wave and wind. Met by the Goddess there with open arms, She brib'd my stay with more than human charms; Nay promis'd, vainly promis'd, to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe. But all her blandishments successless prove, Dacier, from Eustathius, assigns the reason of the refusal of Ulysses to comply with the proffers of Calypso, to forsake his wife and country: It was, because he knew that women in love promise more than they either can, or intend to perform. An insinuation, that he would have comply'd if he had thought the Goddess would, or could, have perform'd her promises. But this is contrary to the character of Ulysses, whose greatest Glory it is, not to have listen'd even to a Goddess. In this view he ceases to be an Heroe, and his return is no longer a virtue, but he returns only because he found not a temptation sufficient to keep him from his country. To banish from my breast my country's love. I stay reluctant sev'n continu'd years, And water her ambrosial couch with tears. The eighth, she voluntary moves to part, Or urg'd by Jove, or her own changeful heart. A Raft was form'd to cross the surging sea; Her self supply'd the stores and rich array; And gave the gales to waft me on the way. In sev'nteen days appear'd your pleasing coast, And woody mountains half in vapours lost. Joy touch'd my soul: My soul was joy'd in vain, For angry Neptune rouz'd the raging main: The wild winds whistle, and the billows roar; The splitting Raft the furious tempest tore; And storms vindictive intercept the shore. Soon as their rage subsides, the seas I brave With naked force, and shoot along the wave, To reach this Isle: but there my hopes were lost, The surge impell'd me on a craggy coast. I chose the safer sea, and chanc'd to find A river's mouth impervious to the wind, And clear of rocks. I fainted by the flood; Then took the shelter of the neighb'ring wood. 'Twas night, and cover'd in the foliage deep, Jove plung'd my senses in the death of sleep. All night I slept, oblivious of my pain: Aurora dawn'd, and Phœbus shin'd in vain, Nor 'till oblique he slop'd his evening ray, Had Somnus dry'd the balmy dews away. Then female voices from the shore I heard: A maid amidst them, Goddess-like, appear'd: To her I su'd; she pity'd my distress; Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less. Who from such youth cou'd hope consid'rate care? In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare! In the preceding line Ulysses speaks of Nausicaa, yet immediately changes the words into the Masculine gender, for grammatically it ought to be ???????? ??????????. Homer makes this alteration to pay the greater compliment to Nausicaa, and he intends to express by it, that neither woman nor man of her years could be expected to have such remarkable discretion. Eustathius. Such sentences being very frequent in the Odyssey; it may not be improper to observe, of what beauty a sentence is in Epic Poetry. A Sentence may be defin'd, a moral instruction couch'd in few words. Rapine asserts, that sentences are more proper in Dramatic than Heroic Poetry: for Narration is the essential character of it, and it ought to be one continued thread of discourse, simple and natural, without an affectation of figures, or moral reflections: that energy which some pretend to collect and inclose within a small compass of words, is wont extremely to weaken the rest of the discourse, and give it a forc'd air: it seems to jut out of the structure of the Poem, and to be independent of it: he blames Homer for scattering his sentences too plentifully thro' his Poesy, and calls it an affectation and imperfection. These objections would undoubtedly be of weight, if the sentences were so introduc'd as to break the thread of narration, as Rapine rightly observes. But is this the case with relation to Homer? He puts them into the mouth of the Actors themselves, and the narration goes on without the least interruption: It is not the Poet who speaks, nor does he suspend the narration to make a refin'd reflection, or give us a sentence of Morality. Is his Poetry the worse, because he makes his agents speak weightily and sententiously? It is true, sentences used without moderation are absurd in Epic Poetry; they give it a seriousness that is more becoming the gravity of Philosophers, than the Spirit and Majesty of Poetry. Bossu judiciously observes, that such thoughts have in their very nature a certain kind of calm Wisdom that is contrary to the passions; but says he, sentences make a Poem useful, and it seems natural to imagine, that the more a work is embellish'd with them, the more it deserves that general approbation which Horace promises to those who have the art to mix the profitable with the pleasant. In short, sentences are not only allowable but beautiful in Heroic Poetry, if they are introduc'd with propriety, and without affectation. She gave me life, reliev'd with just supplies My wants, and lent these robes that strike your eyes. This is the truth: And oh ye pow'rs on high! Forbid that want shou'd sink me to a lye. To this the King. Our daughter but exprest Her cares imperfect to our godlike guest. Suppliant to her, since first he chose to pray, Why not her self did she conduct the way, And with her handmaids to our court convey? Heroe and King! (Ulysses thus reply'd) Nor blame her faultless, nor suspect of pride: She bade me follow in th'attendant train; This is directly contrary to what is before asserted in the preceding book, where Nausicaa forbids Ulysses to attend her, to avoid suspicion and slander: Is not Ulysses then guilty of falshood, and is not falshood beneath the character of a Heroe? Eustathius confesses that Ulysses is guilty ??????? ????????, and he adds, that a wise man may do so sometimes opportunely. ???? ?? ??????? ?? ????? ? ?????. I fear this concession of the Bishop's would not pass for good casuistry in these ages. Spondanus is of the same opinion as Eustathius; Vir prudens certo loco &amp; tempore mendaciis officiosissimis uti novit. Dacier confesses that he somewhat disguises the truth. It will be difficult to vindicate Ulysses from the imputation, if the notions of truth and falshood were as strict in former, as in these ages: but we must not measure by this standard: It is certain that anciently Lying was reckon'd no crime by a whole nation; and it still bears a dispute, An omne falsi-loquium sit mendacium? Some Casuists allow of the officiosum mendacium, and such is this of Ulysses, entirely complemental and officious. But fear and rev'rence did my steps detain, Lest rash suspicion might alarm thy mind: Man's of a jealous and mistaking kind. Far from my soul (he cry'd) the Gods efface All wrath ill-grounded, and suspicion base! Whate'er is honest, Stranger, I approve, And would to Phœbus, Pallas, and to Jove, Such as thou art, thy thought and mine were one, Nor thou unwilling to be call'd my son. The Ancients observe, that Alcinous very artfully inserts this proposition to Ulysses, to prove his veracity. If he had embraced it without hesitation, he would have concluded him an impostor; for it is not conceivable that he should reject all the temptations to marriage made him by Calypso a Goddess, and yet immediately embrace this offer of Alcinous to marry his daughter. But if we take the passage in another sense, and believe that Alcinous spoke sincerely without any secret suspicions, yet his conduct is justifiable. It has I confess appear'd shocking, that Alcinous, a King, should at the very first interview offer his daughter to a stranger, who might be a vagrant and impostor: But examples are frequent in Antiquity of marriages thus concluded between strangers, and with as little hesitation: Thus Bellerophon, Tydeus, and Polinyces were married. Great personages regarded not riches, but were only sollicitous to procure worthy Husbands for their daughters, and birth and virtue were the best recommendations. It is observable that in the original there is a Chasm, an Infinitive mood without any thing to govern it; we must therefore supply the word ??????? to make it right construction. Eustathius. In such alliance could'st thou wish to join, A Palace stor'd with treasures shou'd be thine. But if reluctant, who shall force thy stay? Jove bids to set the stranger on his way, And ships shall wait thee with the morning ray. 'Till then let slumber close thy careful eyes; The wakeful mariners shall watch the skies, And seize the moment when the breezes rise: Then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore, Where thy soul rests, and labour is no more. Far as Eubæa tho' thy country lay, Eubæa, as Eustathius observes, is really far distant from Corcyra, the country of the Phæacians: But Alcinous still makes it more distant, by placing it in another part of the world, and describing it as one of the fortunate Islands; for in the fourth book Rhadamanthus is said to inhabit the Elysian fields. Alcinous therefore endeavours to have it believ'd that his Isle is near those fields, by asserting that Rhadamanthus made use of Phæacian vessels in his voyage to Tityus, Eustathius further adds, that Rhadamanthus was a Prince of great justice, and Tityus a person of great impiety, and that he made this voyage to bring him over to more virtuous dispositions. Our ships with ease transport thee in a day. Thither of old, Earth's Tityus. Giant-son to view, On wings of winds with Rhadamanth they flew: This land, from whence their morning course begun, If Homer had given the true situation of Corcyra as it really lies opposite to Epirus, yet the Hyperbole of sailing thence to Eubæa and returning in the same day, had been utterly an impossibility; for in sailing thither they must pass the Ionian and Icarian seas, and double the Peloponnesus. But the fiction is yet more extravagant, by the Poet's placing it still more distant near the Fortunate Islands. But what is impossible for vessels to effect, that are as swift as birds, and can sail with the rapidity of a thought? Eustathius. But then is the Poet justifiable for relating such incredible amplifications? It may be answer'd, if he had put these extravagancies into the mouth of Ulysses, he had been unpardonable, but they suit well with the character of Alcinous: They let Ulysses into his disposition, and he appears to be ignorant, credulous, and ostentatious. This was necessary, that Ulysses might know how to adapt himself to his humour, and engage his assistance; and this he actually brings about by raising his wonder and esteem by stories, that could not fail to please such an ignorant and credulous person as Alcinous. Dacier adds, that the Phæacians were so puff'd up with their constant felicity and the protection of the Gods, that they thought nothing impossible; upon this opinion all these Hyperboles are founded: And this agrees too well with human nature; the more happy men are, the more high and extravagantly they talk, and are too apt to entertain themselves with wild Chimæra's which have no existence but in the Imagination. The moral then of these fables of Alcinous is, that a constant series of happiness intoxicates the mind, and that moderation is often learn'd in the school of adversity. Saw them returning with the setting sun. Your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale, Our youth how dext'rous, and how fleet our sail, When justly tim'd with equal sweep they row, And Ocean whitens in long tracts below. Thus he. No word th'experienc'd man replies, But thus to heav'n (and heav'nward lifts his eyes) O Jove! oh father! what the King accords It is observable, that Ulysses makes no reply directly to the obliging proposition which the King made concerning his daughter. A refusal might have been disadvantageous to his present circumstances, yet an answer is imply'd in this prayer, which shews the impatience he has to return to his country, and the gratitude he feels for his promises to effect it: and consequently it discovers that he has no intentions of settling with his daughter amongst the Phæacians. Dacier. Do thou make perfect! sacred be his words! Wide o'er the world Alcinous' glory shine! Let Fame be his, and ah! my country mine! Mean-time Arete, for the hour of rest Ordains the fleecy couch, and cov'ring vest; Bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare, And the thick carpets spread with busy care. With torches blazing in their hands they past, And finish'd all their Queen's command with haste: Then gave the signal to the willing guest; He rose with pleasure, and retir'd to rest. There, soft-extended, to the murm'ring sound Of the high porch, Ulysses sleeps profound: Within, releas'd from cares Alcinous lies; It may seem somewhat extraordinary, that Alcinous and his Queen who have been describ'd as patterns of conjugal happiness should sleep in distinct beds. Jupiter and Juno, as Dacier observes from the first of the Iliad, have the same bed. Perhaps the Poet design'd to shew the luxury and false delicacy of those too happy Phæacians, who liv'd in such softness that they shunn'd every thing that might prove troublesome or incommodious. This book takes up no longer time than the evening of the thirty second day. And fast beside, were clos'd Arete's eyes. It may seem somewhat extraordinary, that Alcinous and his Queen who have been describ'd as patterns of conjugal happiness should sleep in distinct beds. Jupiter and Juno, as Dacier observes from the first of the Iliad, have the same bed. Perhaps the Poet design'd to shew the luxury and false delicacy of those too happy Phæacians, who liv'd in such softness that they shunn'd every thing that might prove troublesome or incommodious. This book takes up no longer time than the evening of the thirty second day. THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. Alcinous calls a Council, in which it is resolved to transport Ulysses into his country. After which splendid entertainments are made, where the celebrated Musician and Poet Demodocus, plays and sings to the guests. They next proceed to the games, the race, the wrestling, Discus, &amp;c. where Ulysses casts a prodigious length, to the admiration of all the spectators. They return again to the banquet, and Demodocus sings the loves of Mars and Venus. Ulysses, after a compliment to the Poet, desires him to sing the introduction of the wooden horse into Troy; which subject provoking his tears, Alcinous enquires of his guest, his name, parentage and fortunes. This book has been more severely censur'd by the Critics than any in the whole Odyssey: It may therefore be thought necessary to lay before the Reader what may be offer'd in the Poet's vindication. Scaliger in his Poetics is very warm against it. Demodocus, observes that Critic, sings the lust of the Gods (fœditates) at the feast of Alcinous. And Bossu, tho' he vindicates the Poet, remarks that we meet with some offensive passages in Homer, and instances in the adultery of Mars and Venus. To know (says Aristotle in his Art of Poetry) whether a thing be well or ill spoken, we must not only examine the thing whether it be good or ill, but we must also have regard to him that speaks or acts, and to the person to whom the Poet addresses: for the character of the person who speaks, and of him to whom he speaks, makes that to be good, which would not come well from the mouth of any other person. 'Tis on this account we vindicate Homer with respect to the Immorality that is found in the fable of the Adultery of Mars and Venus; We must consider that it is neither the Poet, nor his Heroe, that recites that story: but a Phæacian sings it to Phæacians, a soft effeminate people, at a festival. Besides, it is allowable even in grave and moral writings to introduce vicious persons, who despise the Gods; and is not the Poet oblig'd to adapt his Poetry to the characters of such persons? And had it not been an absurdity in him to have given us a Philosophical or Moral song before a people who would be pleas'd with nothing but gaiety and effeminacy? The Moral that we are to draw from this story is, that an idle and soft course of life is the source of all criminal pleasures; and that those persons who lead such lives, are generally pleas'd to hear such stories, as make their betters partakers in the same vices. This relation of Homer is a useful lesson to them who desire to live virtuously; and it teaches, that if we would not be guilty of such vices, we must avoid such a method of life as inevitably leads to the practice of them. Rapine attacks this book on another side, and blames it not for its Immorality, but Lowness. Homer, says he, puts off that air of grandeur and majesty which so properly belongs to his character, he debases himself into a Droll, and sinks into a familiar way of talking: he turns things into ridicule, by endeavouring to entertain his Reader with something pleasant and diverting: For instance, in the eighth book of the Odyssey, he entertains the Gods with a Comedy, some of whom he makes buffoons: Mars and Venus are introduced upon the stage, taken in a net laid by Vulcan, contrary to the gravity which is so essential to Epic Poetry. It must be granted, that the Gods are here painted in colours unworthy of Deities, yet still with propriety, if we respect the spectators, who are ignorant, debauch'd Phæacians. Homer was oblig'd to draw them not according to his own idea of the Gods, but according to the wild fancies of the Phæacians. The Poet is not at liberty to ascribe the wisdom of a Socrates to Alcinous: He must follow Nature, and like a painter he may draw Deities or monsters, and introduce as he pleases either vicious or virtuous characters, provided he always makes them of a piece, consistent with their first representation. This rule of Aristotle in general vindicates Homer, and 'tis necessary to carry it in our minds, because it ought to be apply'd to all incidents that relate to the Phæacians, in the sequel of the Odyssey. Now fair Aurora lifts her golden ray, And all the ruddy Orient flames with day: Alcinous, and the chief with dawning light, Rose instant from the slumbers of the night; Then to the Council seat they bend their way, And fill the shining thrones along the bay. This place of Council was between the two ports, where the Temple of Neptune stood; probably, like that in the second book, open to the air. Mean-while Minerva in her guardian care Shoots from the starry vault thro' fields of air; In form a herald of the King she flies It may be ask'd what occasion there is to introduce a Goddess, to perform an action that might have been as well executed by a real Herald? Eustathius observes, that this Minerva is either Fame, which informs the Phæacians that a stranger of uncommon figure is arriv'd, and upon this report they assemble; or it implies, that this assembly was made by the wisdom of the Peers, and consequently a Poet may ascribe it to the Goddess of Wisdom, it being the effect of her inspiration. The Poet by the introduction of a Deity warns us, that something of importance is to succeed; this is to be usher'd in with solemnity, and consequently the appearance of Minerva in this place is not unnecessary: The action of importance to be describ'd is no less than the change of the fortunes of Ulysses; it is from this assembly that his affairs take a new turn, and hasten to a happy re-establishment. From Peer to Peer, and thus incessant cries. Nobles and Chiefs who rule Phæacia's states, The King in council your attendance waits: A Prince of grace divine your aid implores, Minerva speaks thus in favour of Ulysses, to excite the curiosity of the Phæacians: and indeed the short speech is excellently adapted to this purpose. They were fond of strangers: The Goddess therefore tells them, that a stranger is arriv'd of a God-like appearance. They admir'd outward show, he is therefore describ'd as a man of extraordinary beauty, and Minerva for this reason immediately improves it. Eustathius. O'er unknown seas arriv'd from unknown shores. She spoke, and sudden with tumultuous sounds Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds; At once the seats they fill: and every eye Gaz'd, as before some brother of the sky. Pallas with grace divine his form improves, This circumstance has been repeated several times almost in the same words, since the beginning of the Odyssey. I cannot be of opinion that such repetitions are beauties. In any other Poet, they might have been thought to proceed from a poverty of invention, tho' certainly not in Homer, in whom there is rather a superfluity than barrenness. Perhaps having once said a thing well, he despair'd of improving it, and so repeated it; or perhaps he intended to inculcate this truth, that all our accomplishments, as beauty, strength, &amp;c. are the gifts of the Gods; and being willing to fix it upon the mind, he dwells upon it, and inserts it in many places. Here indeed it has a particular propriety, as it is a circumstance that first engages the Phæacians in the favour of Ulysses: his beauty was his first recommendation, and consequently the Poet with great judgment sets his Heroe off to the best advantage, it being an incident from which he dates all his future happiness; and therefore to be insisted upon with a particular solemnity. Plato in his Theætetus applies the latter part of this description to Parmenides. ??????? ?? ??? ???????? ????? ??? ?????? ??. More high he treads, and more enlarg'd he moves: She sheds celestial bloom, regard to draw, And gives a dignity of mien, to awe, With strength the future prize of fame to play, And gather all the honours of the day. Then from his glitt'ring throne Alcinous rose; It might be expected that Ulysses, upon whose account alone Alcinous calls this assembly, should have made his condition known, and spoken himself to the Phæacians; whereas he appears upon the stage as a mute person, and the multitude departs entirely ignorant of his name and fortunes. It may be answer'd, that this was not a proper time for a fuller discovery, the Poet defers it till Ulysses had distinguish'd himself in the games, and fully rais'd their curiosity. It is for the same reason that Ulysses is silent; if he had spoken he could not have avoided to let them into the knowledge of his condition, but the contrary method is greatly for his advantage, and assures him of success from the recommendation of a King. But there is another, and perhaps a better reason, to be given for this silence of Ulysses: The Poet reserves the whole story of his sufferings for an entire and uninterrupted narration; if he had now made any discovery, he must afterwards either have fall'n into tautology, or broken the thread of the relation, so that it would not have been of a piece, but wanted continuity. Besides, it comes with more weight at once, than if it had been made at several times, and consequently makes a deeper impression upon the memory and passion of the auditors. Virgil has taken a different method in the discovery of Æneas; there was a necessity for it; his companions, to engage Dido in their protection, tell her they belong to no less a Heroe than Æneas, so that he is in a manner known before he appears; but Virgil after the example of Homer reserves his story for an entire narration. Attend, he cry'd, while we our will disclose, Your present aid this godlike stranger craves, Tost by rude tempest thro' a war of waves: Perhaps from realms that view the rising day, Or nations subject to the western ray. Then grant, what here all sons of woe obtain, (For here affliction never pleads in vain:) Be chosen youths prepar'd, expert to try The vast profound, and bid the vessel fly: Launch the tall bark, and order ev'ry oar, The word in the original is ??????????; which signifies not only a ship that makes its first voyage, but a ship that out-sails other ships, as Eustathius observes. It is not possible for a translator to retain such singularities with any beauty; it would seem pedantry and affectation, and not Poetry. Then in our court indulge the genial hour: Instant you sailors to this task attend, Swift to the palace, all ye Peers ascend: Let none to strangers honours due disclaim; Be there Demodocus, the Bard of fame, Taught by the Gods to please, when high he sings Homer here insinuates, that all good and great qualities are the gifts of God. He shews us likewise, that Music was constantly made use of in the Courts of all the Oriental Princes; we have seen Phemius in Ithaca, a second in Lacedæmon with Menelaus, and Demodocus here with Alcinous. The Hebrews were likewise of remarkable skill in Music; every one knows what effect the harp of David had upon the spirit of Saul. Solomon tells us, that he sought out singing men and singing women to entertain him, like these in Homer, at the time of feasting: Thus another oriental Writer compares Music at feasts to an emerald enclos'd in gold: as a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is the melody of music with pleasant wine. Eccl. xxxii. 6. Dacier. The vocal lay responsive to the strings. Thus spoke the Prince: th'attending Peers obey, In state they move; Alcinous leads the way: Swift to Demodocus the herald flies, At once the sailors to their charge arise: They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails, And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales; Then to the palace move: A gath'ring throng, Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along: Now all accesses to the dome are fill'd; Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill'd: Two beeves, twelve fatlings from the flock they bring To crown the feast, so wills the bounteous King. The herald now arrives, and guides along The sacred master of celestial song: Dear to the Muse! who gave his days to flow It has been generally thought that Homer represents himself in the person of Demodocus: and Dacier imagines that this passage gave occasion to the Ancients to believe that Homer was blind. But that he really was blind is testify'd by himself in his Hymn to Apollo, which Thucydides asserts to be the genuine production of Homer, and quotes it as such in his history. ? ?????? ??? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??? ?? ???????? ???????? ????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??????????? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ? That is, “O Virgins, if any person asks you who is he, the most pleasing of all Poets, who frequents this place, and who is he who most delights you? reply, he is a blind man, &amp;c.” 'Tis true, as Eustathius observes, that there are many features in the two Poets that bear a great resemblance; Demodocus sings divinely, the same is true of Homer; Demodocus sings the adventures of the Greeks before Troy, so does Homer in his Iliads. If this be true, it must be allow'd that Homer has found out a way of commending himself very artfully: Had he spoken plainly, he had been extravagantly vain; but by this indirect wayof praise, the Reader is at liberty to apply it either solely to Demodocus, or obliquely to Homer. It is remarkable, that Homer takes a very extraordinary care of Demodocus his brother Poet; and introduces him as a person of great distinction. He calls him in this book the Heroe Demodocus: He places him on a throne studded with silver, and gives him an herald for his attendant, nor is he less careful to provide for his entertainment, he has a particular table, and a capacious bowl set before him to drink as often as he had a mind, as the original expresses it. Some merry wits have turn'd the last circumstance into raillery, and insinuate that Homer in this place as well as in the former means himself in the person of Demodocus, an intimation that he would not be displeas'd to meet with the like hospitality. With mighty blessings, mix'd with mighty woe: With clouds of darkness quench'd his visual ray, But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay. High on a radiant throne sublime in state, Encircled by huge multitudes, he sate: With silver shone the throne; his Lyre well strung To rapturous sounds, at hand Pontonus hung: Before his seat a polish'd table shines, And a full goblet foams with gen'rous wines: His food a herald bore: And now they fed; And now the rage of craving hunger fled. Then fir'd by all the Muse, aloud he sings The mighty deeds of Demigods and Kings: From that fierce wrath the noble song arose, That made Ulysses and Achilles foes: How o'er the feast they doom the fall of Troy; The stern debate Atrides hears with joy: This passage is not without obscurity, but Eustathius thus explains it from Athenæ; In the Iliads the Generals sup with Agamemnon with sobriety and moderation; and if in the Odyssey we see Achilles and Ulysses in contention to the great satisfaction of Agamemnon, it is because these contentions are of use to his affairs; they contend whether force or stratagem is to be employed to take Troy; Achilles after the death of Hector, persuaded to assault it by storm, Ulysses by stratagem. There is a further reason given for the satisfaction which Agamemnon expresses at the contest of these two Heroes: Before the opening of the war of Troy he consulted the oracle concerning the issue of it; Apollo answer'd, that Troy should be taken when two Princes most renown'd for wisdom and valour should contend at a sacrifice of the Gods; Agamemnon rejoices to see the prediction fulfill'd, knowing that the destruction of Troy was at hand, the Oracle being accomplish'd by the contest of Ulysses and Achilles. For heav'n foretold the contest, when he trod The marble threshold of the Delphic God, Curious to learn the counsels of the sky, Ere yet he loos'd the rage of war on Troy. Touch'd at the song, Ulysses strait resign'd Many objections may be made against this relation; it may seem to offend against probability, and appears somewhat incredible, that Demodocus should thus luckily pitch upon the war of Troy for the subject of his song, and still more happily upon the deeds of Ulysses; for instance, a man may die of an Apoplexy, this is probable; but that this should happen just when the Poet has occasion for it, is in some degree incredible. But this objection will cease, if we consider not only that the war of Troy was the greatest event of those ages, and consequently might be the common subject of entertainment; but also that it is not Homer or Demodocus who relates the story, but the Muse who inspires it: Homer several times in this book ascribes the song to immediate inspiration; and this supernatural assistance reconciles it to human probability, and the story becomes credible when it is suppos'd to be related by a Deity. Aristotle in his Poetics commends this conduct as artful and judicious; Alcinous, says he, invites Ulysses to an entertainment to divert him, where Demodocus sings his actions, at which he cannot refrain from tears, which Alcinous perceives, and this brings about the discovery of Ulysses. It may further be objected, that a sufficient cause for this violence of tears is not apparent; for why should Ulysses weep to hear his own brave atchievements, especially when nothing calamitous is recited? This indeed would be improbable, if that were the whole of what the Poet sung: But Homer only gives us the heads of the song, a few sketches of a larger draught, and leaves something to be fill'd up by the imagination of the reader. Thus for instance the words of Demodocus recall'd to the mind of Ulysses all the hardships he had undergone during a ten years war, all the scenes of horror he had beheld, and the loss and sufferings of all his friends. And no doubt he might weep even for the calamities he brought upon Troy, an ingenuous nature cannot be insensible when any of its own species suffers; the Trojans were his enemies, but still they were men, and compassion is due even to unfortunate enemies. I doubt not but it will be allow'd, that there is here sufficient cause to draw tears from a heroe, unless a heroe must be supposed to be divested of humanity. To soft affliction all his manly mind: Before his eyes the purple vest he drew, Industrious to conceal the falling dew: But when the music paus'd, he ceas'd to shed The flowing tear, and rais'd his drooping head: And lifting to the Gods a goblet crown'd, He pour'd a pure libation to the ground. Transported with the song, the list'ning train Again with loud applause demand the strain: Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head, Again unmann'd a show'r of sorrow shed: Conceal'd he wept: the King observ'd alone The silent tear, and heard the secret groan: Then to the Bard aloud: O cease to sing, Dumb be thy voice, and mute th'harmonious string; Enough the feast has pleas'd, enough the pow'r Of heav'nly song has crown'd the genial hour! Incessant in the games your strength display, Contest, ye brave, the honours of the day! That pleas'd th'admiring stranger may proclaim In distant regions the Phæacian fame: None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway, Eustathius asks how Alcinous could make such an assertion, and give the preference to his people before all nations, when he neither knew, nor was known to, any heroes out of his own Island? He answers that he speaks like a Phæacian, with ostentation and vanity; besides it is natural for all people to form, not illaudably, too favourable a judgment of their own country; And this agrees with the character of the Phæcians in a more particular manner, who call'd themselves ????????, and the favourites of the Gods. Or swifter in the race devour the way: None in the leap spring with so strong a bound, Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground, Thus spoke the King; th'attending Peers obey: In state they move, Alcinous leads the way: His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung, High on a column in the palace hung: And guided by a herald's guardian cares, Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs. Now swarms the populace; a countless throng, Youth and hoar age; and man drives man along: The games begin: Ambitious of the prize, Eustathius remarks, that Homer very judiciously passes over these games in a few lines, having in the Iliad exhausted that subject; he there enlarg'd upon them, because they were essential ornaments, it being necessary that Patroclus should be honour'd by his friend with the utmost solemnity. Here they are only introduc'd occasionally, and therefore the Poet hastens to things more requisite, and carries on the thread of his story. But then it may be ask'd why are they mention'd at all, and what do they contribute to the re-establishment of Ulysses? It is evident that they are not without an happy effect, they give Ulysses an opportunity to signalize his character, to engage the King and the Peers in his favour, and induces them to convey him to his own country, which is one of the most material incidents in the whole Odyssey. Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise; The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim, Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame: There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus appear, And fam'd Amphialus, Polyneus' heir: Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose, I was at a loss for a reason why this figure of terror was introduc'd amongst an unwarlike nation, upon an occasion contrary to the general description in the midst of games and diversions. Eustathius takes notice, that the Poet distinguishes the character of Euryalus, to force it upon our observation; he being the person who uses Ulysses with roughness and inhumanity, and is the only Peer that is describ'd with a sword, which he gives to Ulysses to repair his injury. He further remarks, that almost all the names of the persons who are mention'd as candidates in these games are borrow'd from the sea, Phæacia being an Island, and the people greatly addicted to navigation. I have taken the liberty to vary from the order observ'd by Homer in the catalogue of the names, to avoid the affinity of sound in many of them, as Euryalus, Ocyalus, &amp;c. and too many names being tedious at least in English Poetry, I pass'd over the three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas, Halius, and Æroneus, and only mention'd them in general as the sons of Alcinous. I was surpriz'd to see Dacier render ? ???? ???????? ?????????? The son of Polyneus the carpenter: it looks like Burlesque: it ought to be render'd, The son of Polyneus Textonides, a Patronymic, and it is so understood by all Commentators. When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes: Naubolides with grace unequall'd shone, Or equal'd by Laodamas alone. With these came forth Ambasineus the strong; And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung. Rang'd in a line the ready racers stand, Start from the goal, and vanish o'er the strand: Swift as on wings of winds upborn they fly, And drifts of rising dust involve the sky: Before the rest, what space the hinds allow This image drawn from rural affairs is now become obsolete, and gives us no distinct Idea of the distance between Clytoneus and the other racers: but this obscurity arises not from Homer's want of perspicuity, but from the change which has happen'd in the method of tillage, and from a length of time which has effaced the distinct image which was originally stamp'd upon it; so that what was understood universally in the days of Homer is grown almost unintelligible to posterity. Eustathius only observes, that the teams of Mules were placed at some distance from the teams of Oxen; the Mule being more swift in his labour than the Ox, and consequently more ground was allow'd to the Mule than the Ox by the Husbandman. This gives us an Idea that Clyteneus was the foremost of the racers, but how much is not to be discover'd with any certainty. Aristarchus, as Didymus informs us, thus interprets Homer. “As much as a yoke of mules set to work at the same time with a yoke of oxen, outgoes the oxen, (for mules are swifter than oxen) so much Clyteneus outwent his competitors.” The same description occurs in the tenth book of the Iliads, verse 419, to which passage I refer the Reader for a more large and different explication. Between the mule and ox, from plow to plow; Clytonius sprung: he wing'd the rapid way, And bore th'unrival'd honours of the day. With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers joyn; The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine. Amphialus sprung forward with a bound, Superior in the leap, a length of ground: From Elatreus' strong arm the Discus flies, And sings with unmatch'd force along the skies. And Laodame whirls high, with dreadful sway, The gloves of death, victorious in the fray. While thus the Peerage in the games contends, In act to speak, Laodamas ascends: O friends, he cries, the stranger seems well skill'd To try th'illustrious labours of the field: I deem him brave; then grant the brave man's claim, Invite the Hero to his share of fame. What nervous arms he boasts! how firm his tread! His limbs how turn'd! how broad his shoulders spread! By age unbroke!—but all-consuming care It is in the original literally, he wants not youth; this is spoken according to appearance only, for Ulysses must be suppos'd to be above forty, having spent twenty years in the wars of Troy, and in his return to his country. 'Tis true Hesiod calls a person a youth, ??????, who was forty years of age, but this must be understood with some allowance, unless we suppose that the life of man was longer in the times of Hesiod, than in these later ages; the contrary of which appears from many places in Homer, where the shortness of man's life is compar'd to the leaves of trees, &amp;c. But what the Poet here relates is very justifiable, for the Youth which Ulysses appears to have, proceeds from Minerva; it is not a natural quality, but conferr'd by the immediate operation of a Goddess. This speech concludes with an address of great beauty; Laodamas invites Ulysses to act in the games, yet at the same time furnishes him with a decent excuse, to decline the invitation if it be against his inclinations; should he refuse, he imputes the refusal to his calamities, not to any want of skill, or personal inability. Destroys perhaps the strength that time wou'd spare: Dire is the Ocean, dread in all its forms! Man must decay, when man contends with storms. Well hast thou spoke, (Euryalus replies) Thine is the guest, invite him thou to rise. Swift at the word advancing from the croud He made obeysance, and thus spoke aloud. Vouchsafes the rev'rend stranger to display His manly worth, and share the glorious day? Father, arise! for thee thy port proclaims Expert to conquer in the solemn games. To fame arise! for what more fame can yield Than the swift race, or conflict of the field? Steal from corroding care one transient day, To glory give the space thou hast to stay; Short is the time, and lo! ev'n now the gales Call thee aboard, and stretch the swelling sails. To whom with sighs Ulysses gave reply: These are the first words spoken by Ulysses before the Phæacians; and we cannot but be curious to know how he makes his address to engage a people, in whom he has no personal interest, in his favour. His speech is excellently adapted to this purpose; he represents himself as a suppliant to the King and all the assembly; and all suppliants being esteem'd sacred, he at once makes it a duty in all the assembly to protect him; if they refuse to assist him, they become guilty of no less a crime, than a violation of the laws of hospitality. Ah why th'ill-suiting pastime must I try? To gloomy care my thoughts alone are free; Ill the gay sports with troubled hearts agree: Sad from my natal hour my days have ran, A much-afflicted, much-enduring man! Who suppliant to the King and Peers, implores A speedy voyage to his native shores. Wide wanders, Laodame, thy erring tongue, The sports of glory to the brave belong, (Retorts Euryalus:) He boasts no claim Among the great, unlike the sons of Fame. A wand'ring merchant he frequents the main, Some mean sea-farer in pursuit of gain; Studious of freight, in naval trade well skill'd, But dreads th'athletic labours of the field. Incens'd Ulysses with a frown replies, O forward to proclaim thy soul unwise! With partial hands the Gods their gifts dispense; Some greatly think, some speak with manly sense; Here heav'n an elegance of form denies, But wisdom the defect of form supplies: This man with energy of thought controuls, And steals with modest violence our souls, There is a difficulty in the Greek expression, ???????? ???????? ????? ????????; that is, “he speaks securely with a winning modesty.” Dionysius Halicarnassus interprets it, in his Examination of Oratory, to signify that the Orator argues per concessa, and so proceeds with certainty, or ????????; without danger of refutation. The word properly signifies without stumbling, ??????????, as in the proverb cited by Eustathius, ??????????? ????? ???? ?????? ???????????; that is, “it is better to stumble with the feet than with the tongue.” The words are concise, but of a very extensive comprehension, and take in every thing, both in sentiments and diction, that enters into the character of a compleat orator. Dacier concurs in the same interpretation; He speaks reservedly, or with caution; he hazards nothing that he would afterwards wish (repentir) to alter. And all his words are full of sweetness and modesty. These two lines are found almost literally in Hesiod's Theogony, ver. 92. ????????? ?? ??? ????, ???? ?? ?????????? ????? ????????. ???? ?? ?????? ????????????. Whether Homer borrow'd these verses from Hesiod, or Hesiod from Homer, is not evident. Tully in his book de Senectute is of opininion, that Homer preceded Hesiod many ages, and consequently in his judgment the verses are Homer's. I question not but he had this very passage in view in his third book of his Orator. Quem stupefacti dicentem intuetur, quem Deum, ut ita dicam, inter homines putant; which is almost a translation of Homer. He speaks reserv'dly, but he speaks with force, Nor can one word be chang'd but for a worse; In public more than mortal he appears, And as he moves the gazing croud reveres. While others beauteous as th'æthereal kind, The nobler portion want, a knowing mind. In outward show heav'n gives thee to excell, But heav'n denies the praise of thinking well. Ill bear the brave a rude ungovern'd tongue, And, youth, my gen'rous soul resents the wrong: Skill'd in heroic exercise, I claim It may be thought that Ulysses, both here and in his subsequent speech, is too ostentatious, and that he dwells more than modesty allows upon his own accomplishments: But self-praise is sometimes no fault. Plutarch has wrote a dissertation, how a man may praise himself without envy: What Ulysses here speaks is not a boast but a justification. Persons in distress, says Plutarch, may speak of themselves with dignity: It shews a greatness of soul, and that they bear up against the storms of fortune with bravery; they have too much courage to fly to pity and commiseration, which betray despair and an hopeless condition: Such a man struggling with ill fortune shews himself a champion, and if by a bravery of speech he transforms himself from miserable and abject, into bold and noble, he is not to be censur'd as vain or obstinate, but great and invincible. This is a full justification of Ulysses, he opposes virtue to calumny; and what Horace applies to himself we apply to this Heroe. Quæsitam meritis, sume superbiam. Besides, it was necessary to shew himself a person of figure and distinction, to recommend his condition to the Phæacians. He was a stranger to the whole nation, and he therefore takes a probable method to engage their assistance by acquainting them with his worth; he describes himself as unfortunate, but yet as a heroe in adversity. A post of honour with the sons of Fame: Such was my boast, while vigour crown'd my days, Now care surrounds me, and my force decays; Inur'd a melancholy part to bear, In scenes of death, by tempest and by war. Yet thus by woes impair'd, no more I wave To prove the heroe.—Slander stings the brave, Then striding forward with a furious bound, He wrench'd a rocky fragment from the ground: By far more pond'rous and more huge by far, Than what Phæacia's sons discharg'd in air. Fierce from his arm th'enormous load he flings; Sonorous thro' the shaded air it sings; Couch'd to the earth, tempestuous as it flies, The crowd gaze upward while it cleaves the skies. Beyond all marks, with many a giddy round Down rushing, it up-turns a hill of ground. That instant Pallas, bursting from a cloud, There is not a passage in the whole Odyssey, where a Deity is introduced with less apparent necessity: The Goddess of Wisdom is brought down from heaven to act what might have been done as well by any of the spectators, namely to proclaim what was self-evident, the victory of Ulysses. When a Deity appears, our expectations are awaken'd for the introduction of something important, but what action of importance succeeds? 'Tis true, her appearance encourages Ulysses, and immediately upon it he challenges the whole Phæacian assembly. But he was already victor, and no further action is perform'd. If indeed she had appear'd openly in favour of Ulysses, this would have been greatly advantageous to him, and the Phæacians must have highly reverenc'd a person who was so remarkably honour'd by a Goddess: but it is not evident that the Phæacians, or even Ulysses knew the Deity, but took her for a man as she appear'd to be; and Ulysses himself immediately rejoices that he had found a friend in the assembly. If this be true, the descent of Pallas will prove very unnecessary; for if she was esteem'd to be meerly human, she acts nothing in the character of a Deity, and performs no more than might have been performed by a man, and consequently gave no greater courage to Ulysses than a friend actually gave, for such only he believ'd her to be. Eustathius appears to be of the same opinion, for he says the place is to be understood allegorically, and what is thus spoken by a Phæacian with Wisdom, is by the Poet apply'd to the Goddess of it. Fix'd a distinguish'd mark, and cry'd aloud. Ev'n he who sightless wants his visual ray, May by his touch alone award the day: Thy signal throw transcends the utmost bound Of ev'ry champion, by a length of ground: Securely bid the strongest of the train Arise to throw: the strongest throws in vain. She spoke: and momentary mounts the sky: The friendly voice Ulysses hears with joy; Then thus aloud, (elate with decent pride) Rise ye Phæacians, try your force, he cry'd; If with this throw the strongest Caster vye, Still, further still, I bid the Discus fly. Stand forth, ye champions, who the gauntlet wield, Or you, the swiftest racers of the field! Stand forth, ye wrestlers, who these pastimes grace! I wield the gauntlet, and I run the race. In such heroic games I yield to none, Or yield to brave Laodamas alone: Shall I with brave Laodamas contend? Nothing can be more artful than this address of Ulysses; he finds a way, in the middle of a bold challenge, to secure himself of a powerful advocate, by paying an ingenious and laudable deference to his friend. But it may be ask'd if decency be observ'd, and ought Ulysses to challenge the father Alcinous, (for he speaks universally) and yet except his son Laodamas, especially when Alcinous was more properly his friend than Laodamas? and why should he be excepted rather than the other brothers? Spondanus answers, that the two brothers are included in the person of Laodamas, they all have the same relation to Ulysses, as being equally a suppliant to them all, and consequently claim the same exemption from this challenge as Laodamas; and Alcinous is not concern'd in it: he is the judge and arbitrator of the games, not a candidate, like Achilles in the Iliad. But why is Laodamas nam'd in particular? He was the elder brother, and Ulysses might therefore be consign'd to his care in particular, by the right due to his seniority; besides, he might be the noblest personage, having conquer'd his antagonist at the gauntlet, which was the most dangerous, and consequently the most honourable exercise, and therefore Ulysses might pay him peculiar honours. Spondanus. A friend is sacred, and I stile him friend. Ungen'rous were the man, and base of heart, Who takes the kind, and pays th'ungrateful part; Chiefly the man, in foreign realms confin'd, Base to his friend, to his own interest blind: All, all your heroes I this day defy, Give me a man that we our might may try! Expert in ev'ry art I boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill; Should a whole host at once discharge the bow, There is an ambiguity in the original, and it may imply either, that if Ulysses and his friends were at the same time to aim their arrows against an enemy, his arrow would fly with more certainty and expedition than that of his companions: Or that if his enemies had bent all their bows at once against him, yet his shaft would reach his adversary before they could discharge their arrows. Eustathius follows the former, Dacier the latter interpretation. And certainly the latter argues the greater intrepidity and presence of mind: It shews Ulysses in the extremity of danger capable of acting with calmness and serenity, and shooting with the same certainty and steddiness, tho' multitudes of enemies endanger his life. I have follow'd this explication, as it is nobler, and shews Ulysses to be a consummate Heroe. My well-aim'd shaft with death prevents the foe: Alone superior in the field of Troy, Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly. From all the sons of earth unrival'd praise I justly claim; but yield to better days, To those fam'd days when great Alcides rose, And Eurytus, who bade the Gods be foes: (Vain Eurytus, whose art became his crime, This Eurytus was King of O Echalia, famous for his skill in Archery; he propos'd his daughter Iöle in marriage to any person that could conquer him at the exercise of the bow. Later writers differ from Homer, as Eustathius observes, concerning Eurytus. They write that Hercules overcame him, and he denying his daughter, was slain, and his daughter made captive by Hercules: Whereas Homer writes that he was kill'd by Apollo, that is, died a sudden death, according to the import of that expression. The Ancients differ much about O Echalia; some place it in Eubæa, and some in Messenia, of which opinion is Pausanias. But Homer in the Iliad places it in Thessaly: For he mentions with it Tricca and Ithomè, which as Dacier observes were Cities of Thessaly. Swept from the earth he perish'd in his prime; Sudden th'irremeable way he trod, Who boldly durst defy the Bowyer God.) In fighting fields as far the spear I throw, As flies an arrow from the well-drawn bow. Sole in the race the contest I decline, This is directly contrary to his challenge in the beginning of the speech, where he mentions the race amongst the other games. How then is this difference to be reconcil'd? Very naturally. Ulysses speaks with a generous warmth, and is transported with anger in the beginning of his oration: Here the heat of it is cool'd, and consequently reason takes place, and he has time to reflect, that a man so disabled by calamities is not an equal match for a younger and less fatigued antagonist. This is an exact representation of human nature; when our passions remit, the vehemence of our speech remits; at first he speaks like a man in anger, here like the wise Ulysses. It is observable that Ulysses all along maintains a decency and reverence towards the Gods, even while his anger seems to be master over his reason; he gives Eurytus as an example of the just vengeance of Heaven, and shews himself in a very opposite light: He is so far from contending with the Gods, that he allows himself to be inferior to some other Heroes: an instance of modesty. Stiff are my weary joints; and I resign By storms and hunger worn: Age well may fail, This passage appears to me to refer to the late storms and shipwreck, and the long abstinence Ulysses suffer'd in sailing from Calypso to the Phæacian Island; for when Nausicaa found him, he was almost dead with hunger, as appears from the sixth of the Odyssey. Dacier is of a different opinion, and thinks it relates to his abstinence and shipwreck upon his leaving Circe, before he came to Calypso. This seems very improbable; for Ulysses had liv'd seven years with that Goddess in great affluence, and consequently must be suppos'd to have recruited his loss of strength in so long a time, and with the particular care of a Goddess: Besides, Alcinous was acquainted with his late shipwreck, and his daughter Nausicaa was in some degree witness to it: Is it not therefore more probable that he should refer to this latter incident, than speak of a calamity that happened seven years past, to which they were entirely strangers? Dacier likewise asserts that Eustathius is guilty of a mistake, in making ?????? or provision, to signify the ship it self; but in reality he makes an evident distinction: ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??????? ?? ???????? ????? ???????? ???????? ???? ???????, ???? ??? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ?????? ????; “Ulysses suffer'd not in the storm because he had no provisions to eat, but because the ship that bore the provision was broken by the storm;” which shews a wide difference between the vessel and the provisions: So that the expression really implies that the vessel was broken, but Eustathius is far from affirming that ?????? and ???? (except in such an improper sense) have the same signification. When storms and hunger both at once assail. Abash'd, the numbers hear the god-like man, 'Till great Alcinous mildly thus began. Well hast thou spoke, and well thy gen'rous tongue With decent pride refutes a public wrong: Warm are thy words, but warm without offence; Fear only fools, secure in men of sense: Thy worth is known. Then hear our country's claim, And bear to heroes our heroic fame; In distant realms our glorious deeds display, From this extravagant preface, it might be imagin'd that Alcinous was King of a nation of Heroes: Whereas when he comes to explain the excellence of his subjects, he has scarce any thing to boast of that is manly; they spend an idle life in singing, dancing, and feasting. Thus the Poet all along writes consistently: We may know the Phæacians by their character, which is always to be voluptuous, or as Horace expresses it, ? Alcinoique In cute curandâ plus æquo operata juventus. And Eustathius rightly observes that the Poet does not teach that we ought to live such lives, but only relates historically what lives were led by the Phæacians; he describes them as a contemptible people, and consequently proposes them as objects of our scorn not imitation. Repeat them frequent in the genial day; When blest with ease thy woes and wand'rings end, Teach them thy consort, bid thy sons attend; How lov'd of Jove he crown'd our sires with praise, How we their offspring dignify our race. Let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield, Or boast the glories of th'athletic field; We in the course unrival'd speed display, Or thro' cærulean billows plow the way, To dress, to dance, to sing our sole delight, The feast or bath by day, and love by night: Rise then ye skill'd in measures: let him bear Your fame to men that breathe a distant air: And faithful say, to you the pow'rs belong To race, to sail, to dance, to chaunt the song. But, herald, to the palace swift repair, And the soft Lyre to grace our pastimes bear. Swift at the word, obedient to the King The herald flies the tuneful lyre to bring. Up rose nine Seniors, chosen to survey The future games, the judges of the day: With instant care they mark a spacious round, And level for the dance th'allotted ground; The herald bears the Lyre: Intent to play, The Bard advancing meditates the lay, Skill'd in the dance, tall youths, a blooming band, I beg leave to translate Dacier's Annotation upon this passage, and to offer a remark upon it. This description, says that lady, is remarkable, not because the dancers mov'd to the sound of the harp and the song; for in this there is nothing extraordinary; but in that they danc'd, if I may so express it, an History; that is by their gestures and movements they express'd what the music of the harp and voice describ'd, and the dance was a representation of what was the subject of the Poet's song. Homer only says they danc'd divinely, according to the obvious meaning of the words. I fancy Madam Dacier would have forborn her observation, if she had reflected upon the nature of the song to which the Phæacians danc'd: It was an intrigue between Mars and Venus; and they being taken in some very odd postures, she must allow that these dancers represented some very odd gestures, (or movements as she expresses it) if they were now dancing an History, that is acting in their motions what was the subject of the song. But I submit to the judgment of Ladies, and shall only add, that this is an instance how a critical eye can see some things in an author, that were never intended by him; tho' to do her justice, she borrowed the general remark from Eustathius. The words ?????????? ????? ????? are very expressive, they represent the quick glancings of their feet in the dance, Motus pedum coruscans; or The glancing splendors as their sandals play. Graceful before the heav'nly minstrel stand; Light-bounding from the earth, at once they rise, Their feet half-viewless quiver in the skies: Ulysses gaz'd, astonish'd to survey The glancing splendors as their sandals play. Mean-time the Bard alternate to the strings The Reader may be pleas'd to look back to the beginning of the book for a general vindication of this story. Scaliger in his Poetics prefers the song of Iöpas in Virgil, to this of Demodocus in Homer; Demodocus Deorum canit fœditates, noster Iöpas res rege dignas. Monsieur Dacier in his Annotations upon Aristotle's Poetics refutes the objection. The song of Demodocus, says he, is as well adapted to the inclinations and relish of the Phæacians, as the song of Iöpas is to Queen Dido. It may indeed be question'd whether the subject of Virgil's song be well chosen, and whether the deepest points of Philosophy were entirely proper to be sung to a Queen and her female attendants. The various labours of the wandring Moon, And whence proceed th'eclipses of the Sun, Th'original of men and beasts, and whence The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispence, &amp;c. Dryden. Nor is Virgil more reserv'd than Homer: In the fourth Georgic he introduces a Nymph, who in the Court of the Goddess Cyrenè with her Nymphs about her, sings this very song of Demodocus. To these Clymene the sweet theft declares Of Mars; and Vulcan's unavailing cares; And all the rapes of Gods, and every love From antient Chaos down to youthful Jove. Dryden. So that if either of the Poets are to be blamed, 'tis certainly Virgil: but neither of them, adds that Critic, are culpable: Virgil understood what a chaste Queen ought to hear before strangers, and what women might say when alone amongst themselves; thus to the Queen he sings a philosophical song, the intrigues of Mars and Venus amongst nymphs when they were alone. Plutarch vindicates this story of Homer: There is a way of teaching by mute actions, and those very fables that have given most offence, furnish us with useful contemplations: Thus in the story of Mars and Venus, some have by an unnecessary violence endeavour'd to reduce it into allegory: When Venus is in conjunction with the Star call'd Mars, they have an adultrous influence, but time, or the sun, reveals it. But the Poet himself far better explains the meaning of his fable, for he teaches that light musick and wanton songs debauch the manners, and incline men to an unmanly way of living in luxury and wantonness. In short, Virgil mentions this story, Ovid translates it, Plutarch commends it, and Scaliger censures it. I will add the judgment of a late Writer, Monsieur Boileau, concerning Scaliger, in his Notes upon Longinus. “That proud scholar, says he, intending to erect altars to Virgil, as he expresses it, speaks of Homer too prophanely; but it is a book which he calls in part Hypercritical, to shew that he transgressed the bounds of true Criticism: That piece was a dishonour to Scaliger, and he fell into such gross errors, that he drew upon him the ridicule of all men of letters, and even of his own son. The loves of Mars and Cytherea sings; How the stern God enamour'd with her charms Clasp'd the gay panting Goddess in his arms, By bribes seduc'd: and how the Sun, whose eye Views the broad heav'ns disclos'd the lawless joy. Stung to the soul, indignant thro' the skies To his black forge vindictive Vulcan flies: Arriv'd, his sinewy arms incessant place Th'eternal anvil on the massy base. A wond'rous Net he labours, to betray The wanton lovers, as entwin'd they lay, Indissolubly strong! then instant bears To his immortal dome the finish'd snares. Above, below, around, with art dispread, The sure enclosure folds the genial bed; Whose texture ev'n the search of Gods deceives, Thin, as the filmy threads the spider weaves. Then as withdrawing from the starry bow'rs, He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores: His fav'rite Isle! Observant Mars descries His wish'd recess, and to the Goddess flies; He glows, he burns: The fair-hair'd Queen of love Descends smooth-gliding from the Courts of Jove, Gay blooming in full charms: her hand he prest With eager joy, and with a sigh addrest. Come, my belov'd! and taste the soft delights: Come, to repose the genial bed invites: Thy absent spouse neglectful of thy charms Prefers his barb'rous Sintians to thy arms! The Sintians were the inhabitants of Lemnos, by origin Thracians: Homer calls them barbarous of speech, because their language was a corruption of the Greek, Asiatic, and Thracian. But there is a concealed raillery in the expression, and Mars ridicules the ill taste of Vulcan for leaving so beautiful a Goddess to visit his rude and barbarous Sintians. The Poet calls Lemnos the favourite Isle of Vulcan; this alludes to the subterraneous fires frequent in that Island, and he is feigned to have his forge there, as the God of fire. This is likewise the reason why he is said to fall into the Island Lemnos when Jupiter threw him from Heaven. Dacier. Then, nothing loth, th'enamour'd fair he led, And sunk transported on the conscious bed. Down rush'd the toils, enwrapping as they lay The careless lovers in their wanton play: In vain they strive, th'entangling snares deny (Inextricably firm) the pow'r to fly: Warn'd by the God who sheds the golden day, Stern Vulcan homeward treads the starry way: Arriv'd, he sees, he grieves, with rage he burns; Full horribly he roars, his voice all heav'n returns. O Jove, he cry'd, oh all ye pow'rs above, See the lewd dalliance of the Queen of Love! The original seems to be corrupted; were it to be translated according to the present editions, it must be, See the ridiculous deeds of Venus. I conceive, that few husbands who should take their spouses in such circumstances would have any great appetite to laugh; neither is such an interpretation consonant to the words immediately following, ??? ????????. It is therefore very probable that the verse was originally ????? ??? ???? ???????? ??? ??? ???????? ??????. Come ye Gods, behold the sad and unsufferable deeds of Venus; and this agrees with the tenor of Vulcan's behaviour in this comedy, who has not the least disposition to be merry with his brother Deities. Me, aukward me she scorns, and yields her charms To that fair Lecher, the strong God of arms. If I am lame, that stain my natal hour By fate impos'd; such me my parent bore: Why was I born? see how the wanton lies O sight tormenting to an husband's eyes! But yet I trust, this once ev'n Mars would fly His fair ones arms—he thinks her, once, too nigh. But there remain, ye guilty, in my pow'r, 'Till Jove refunds his shameless daughter's dow'r. I doubt not but this was the usage of antiquity: It has been observed that the bridegroom made presents to the father of the bride, which were call'd ????; and if she was afterwards false to his bed, this dower was restor'd by the father to the husband. Besides this restitution, there seems a pecuniary mulct to have been paid, as appears evident from what follows. ? The God of arms, Must pay the penalty for lawless charms. Homer in this as in many other places seems to allude to the laws of Athens, where death was the punishment of adultery. Pausanias relates that Draco the Athenian lawgiver granted impunity to any person that took revenge upon an adulterer. Such also was the institution of Solon; “If any one seize an adulterer, let him use him as he pleases, ??? ??? ?????? ????, ??? ?? ???????? ???????. And thus Eratosthenes answer'd a person who begg'd his life after he had injur'd his bed, ??? ??? ?? ????????, ???? ??? ?????? ?????, “It is not I who slay thee, but the law of thy country.” But still it was in the power of the injur'd person to take a pecuniary mulct by way of atonement; for thus the same Eratosthenes speak in Lysias, ????????? ??? ??????? ?? ????? ???????, ???? ???????? ?????????, “he entreated me not to take his life, but exact a sum of money.” Nay, such penalties were allow'd by way of commutation for greater crimes than adultery, as in the case of murder: Iliad 9. ? If a brother bleed, On just atonement, we remit the deed: A sire the slaughter of his son forgives; The price of blood discharg'd, the murd'rer lives. Too dear I priz'd a fair enchanting face: Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace. Mean-while the Gods the dome of Vulcan throng Apollo comes, and Neptune comes along, With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain; But modesty with-held the Goddess-train. All heav'n beholds, imprison'd as they lye, And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the sky. Then mutual, thus they spoke: Behold on wrong Plutarch in his dissertation upon reading the Poets, quotes this as an instance of Homer's judgment, in closing a ludicrous scene with decency and instruction. He artfully inserts a sentence by which he discovers his own judgment, and lets the reader into the moral of his fables; by this conduct he makes even the representation of evil actions useful, by shewing the shame and detriment they draw upon those who are guilty of them. Swift vengeance waits: and Art subdues the strong! Dwells there a God on all th'Olympian brow More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow? Yet Vulcan conquers, and the God of arms Must pay the penalty for lawless charms. Thus serious they: but he who gilds the skies, The gay Apollo thus to Hermes cries. Wou'dst thou enchain'd like Mars, oh Hermes, lye And bear the shame like Mars, to share the joy? O envy'd shame! (the smiling Youth rejoin'd,) Add thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind; Gaze all ye Gods, and ev'ry Goddess gaze, Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace. Loud laugh the rest, ev'n Neptune laughs aloud, Yet sues importunate to loose the God: It may be ask'd why Neptune in particular interests himself in the deliverance of Mars, rather than the other Gods? Dacier confesses she can find no reason for it; but Eustathius is of opinion, that Homer ascribes it to that God out of decency, and deference to his superior Majesty and Eminence amongst the other Deities: It is suitable to the character of that most ancient, and consequently honourable God, to interrupt such an indecent scene of mirth, which is not so becoming his personage, as those more youthful Deities Apollo and Mercury. Besides, it agrees well with Neptune's gravity to be the first who is mindful of friendship; so that what is here said of Neptune is not accidental, but spoken judiciously by the Poet in honour of that Deity. And free, he cries, oh Vulcan! free from shame Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim. Will Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust? He suffers who gives surety for th'unjust: This verse is very obscure, and made still more obscure by the explanations of Criticks. Some think it implies, that it is wicked to be surety for a wicked person; and therefore Neptune should not give his promise for Mars thus taken in adultery. Some take it generally; suretyship is detrimental, and it is the lot of unhappy men to be sureties: the words then are to be constru'd in the following order, ?????? ??? ??????, ??? ?????? ?????? ??????????. Sponsiones sunt infelices, &amp; hominum est infelicium sponsiores dare. Others understand it very differently, viz. to imply that the sureties of men of inferior condition, should be to men of inferior condition; then the sentence will bear this import: If Mars, says Vulcan, refuses to discharge the penalty, how shall I compel Neptune to pay it, who is so greatly my superior? And therefore adds by way of sentence, that the sponsor ought to be of the same station with the person to whom he becomes surety; or in Latin simplicium hominum, simplices esse debent sponsores. I have followed Plutarch, who in his banquet of the seven wise men, explains it to signify that it is dangerous to be surety for a wicked person, according to the ancient sentence, ????? ???? ?? ???. Loss follows suretyship. Agreeably to the opinion of a much wiser person, He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; and he that hateth suretyship is sure. Prov. xi. 15. But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky To liberty restor'd, perfidious fly, Say wilt thou bear the Mulct? He instant cries, The mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies. To whom appeas'd: No more I urge delay; When Neptune sues, my part is to obey. Then to the snares his force the God applies; They burst; and Mars to Thrace indignant flies: There is a reason for this particularity: The Thracians were a warlike people: the Poet therefore sends the God of War thither: and the people of Cyprus being effeminate, and addicted to love and pleasures, he feigns the recess of the Goddess of Love to have been in that Island. It is further observable, that he barely mentions the retreat of Mars, but dwells more largely upon the story of Venus. The reason is, the Phæacians had no delight in the God of War, but the soft description of Venus better suited with their inclinations. Eustathius. To the soft Cyprian shores the Goddess moves, To visit Paphos and her blooming groves, Where to the pow'r an hundred altars rise, And breathing odours scent the balmy skies, Conceal'd she bathes in consecrated bow'rs, The Graces unguents shed, ambrosial show'rs, Unguents that charm the Gods! she last assumes Her wond'rous robes; and full the Goddess blooms. Thus sung the Bard: Ulysses hears with joy, And loud applauses rend the vaulted sky. Then to the sports his sons the King commands, Each blooming youth before the monarch stands: In dance unmatch'd! a wond'rous ball is brought, (The work of Polybus, divinely wrought) This youth with strength enormous bids it fly, And bending backward whirls it to the sky; This is a literal translation of ???????? ?????; and it gives us a lively image of a person in the act of throwing towards the skies. Eustathius is most learnedly trifling about this exercise of the ball, which was called ???????, or aereal; it was a kind of a dance, and while they sprung from the ground to catch the ball, they play'd with their feet in the air after the manner of dancers. He reckons up several other exercises at the ball, ?????????, ????????, ?????????, and ???????????; and explains them all largely. Homer seems to oppose this aëreal dance to the common one, ???? ?????, or on the ground, which appears to be added to make an evident distinction between the sports; otherwise it is unnecessary; and to dance upon the ground is imply'd in ?????????, for how should a dance be perform'd but upon the Ground? His brother springing with an active bound At distance intercepts it from the ground: The ball dismiss'd, in dance they skim the strand, Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand. Th'assembly gazes with astonish'd eyes, And sends in shouts applauses to the skies. Then thus Ulysses; Happy King, whose name The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame: In subjects happy! with surprize I gaze: Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise. The original says, You promis'd that your subjects were excellent dancers ?????????; that is, threaten'd: Minans is used in the same sense by the Latins, as Dacier observes; thus Horace, Multa &amp; præclara minantem. Eustathius remarks, that the address of Ulysses is very artful, he calls it a seasonable flattery: In reality to excel in dancing, is but to excel in trifles, but in the opinion of Alcinous it was a most noble qualification: Ulysses therefore pleases his vanity by adapting his praise to his notions; and that which would have been an affront in some nations, is esteem'd as the highest compliment by Alcinous. Pleas'd with his people's fame the Monarch hears, And thus benevolent accosts the Peers. Since Wisdom's sacred guidance he pursues, Give to the stranger-guest a stranger's dues: Twelve Princes in our realm dominion share, O'er whom supreme, imperial pow'r I bear: Bring gold, a pledge of love, a talent bring, A vest, a robe, and imitate your King: Be swift to give; that he this night may share The social feast of joy, with joy sincere. And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong: A gen'rous heart repairs a sland'rous tongue. Th'assenting Peers, obedient to the King, In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring. Then thus Euryalus: O Prince, whose sway Rules this blest realm, repentant I obey! Be his this sword, whose blade of brass displays A ruddy gleam; whose hilt, a silver blaze; Whose ivory sheath inwrought with curious pride, Adds graceful terror to the wearer's side. He said, and to his hand the sword consign'd; And if, he cry'd, my words affect thy mind, Far from thy mind those words, ye whirlwinds bear, And scatter them, ye storms, in empty air! Crown, oh ye heav'ns, with joy his peaceful hours, And grant him to his spouse and native shores! And blest be thou, my friend, Ulysses cries, Crown him with ev'ry joy, ye fav'ring skies; To thy calm hours continu'd peace afford, And never, never may'st thou want this sword! It can scarce be imagin'd how greatly this beautiful passage is misrepresented by Eustathius. He would have it to imply, May I never want this sword, taking ??? adverbially: The presents of enemies were reckon'd fatal, Ulysses therefore to avert the omen, prays that he may never have occasion to have recourse to this sword of Euryalus, but keep it amongst his treasures as a testimony of this reconciliation. This appears to be a very forc'd interpretation, and disagreeable to the general import of the rest of the sentence; he addresses to Euryalus, to whom then can this compliment be naturally paid but to Euryalus? Thou hast given me a sword, says he, may thy days be so peaceable as never to want it! This is an instance of the polite address, and the forgiving temper, of Ulysses. He said, and o'er his shoulder flung the blade. Now o'er the earth ascends the evening shade: The precious gifts th'illustrious heralds bear, And to the court th'embody'd Peers repair. Before the Queen Alcinous' sons unfold The vests, the robes, and heaps of shining gold; Then to the radiant thrones they move in state: Aloft, the King in pomp Imperial sate. Thence to the Queen. O partner of our reign, O sole belov'd! command thy menial train A polish'd chest and stately robes to bear, And healing waters for the bath prepare: That bath'd, our guest may bid his sorrows cease, Hear the sweet song, and taste the feast in peace. A bowl that flames with gold, of wond'rous frame, Our self we give, memorial of our name: To raise in off'rings to almighty Jove, And every God that treads the courts above. Instant the Queen, observant of the King, Commands her train a spacious vase to bring, The spacious vase with ample streams suffice, Heap high the wood, and bid the flames arise. The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace, The fuming waters bubble o'er the blaze. Her self the chest prepares: in order roll'd The robes, the vests are rang'd, and heaps of gold: And adding a rich dress inwrought with art, A gift expressive of her bounteous heart, Thus spoke to Ithacus: To guard with bands Insolvable these gifts, thy care demands: Lest, in thy slumbers on the watry main, The hand of Rapine make our bounty vain. Then bending with full force, around he roll'd A labyrinth of bands in fold on fold, Clos'd with Circæan art. A train attends Such passages as these have more of nature than art, and are too narrative, and different from modern ways of speaking, to be capable of much ornament in Poetry. Eustathius observes that keys were not in use in these ages, but were afterwards invented by the Lacedæmonians; but they used to bind their carriages with intricate knots: Thus the Gordian knot was famous in antiquity. And this knot of Ulysses became a proverb, to express any insolvable difficulty, ? ??? ???????? ??????: This is the reason why he is said to have learned it from Circe; it was of great esteem amongst the Ancients, and not being capable to be unty'd by human art, the invention of it is ascrib'd, not to a man, but to a Goddess. A Poet would now appear ridiculous if he should introduce a Goddess only to teach his Heroe such an art, as to tye a knot with intricacy: but we must not judge of what has been, from what now is; customs and arts are never at a stay, and consequently the ideas of customs and arts are as changeable as those arts and customs: This knot in all probability was in as high estimation formerly, as the finest water-work or machines are at this day; and were a person fam'd for an uncommon skill in such works, it would be no absurdity in the language of poetry, to ascribe his knowledge in them to the assistance of a Deity. Around the bath: the bath the King ascends: (Untasted joy, since that disastrous hour, He sail'd ill-fated from Calypso's bow'r) Where, happy as the Gods that range the sky, He feasted ev'ry sense, with ev'ry joy. He bathes: the damsels with officious toil, Shed sweets, shed unguents, in a show'r of oil: Then o'er his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads, And to the feast magnificently treads. Full where the dome its shining valves expands, Nausicaa blooming as a Goddess stands, With wond'ring eyes the heroe she survey'd, And graceful thus began the royal maid. Hail god-like stranger! and when heav'n restores To thy fond wish thy long-expected shores, This ever grateful in remembrance bear, To me thou ow'st, to me, the vital air. O royal maid, Ulysses strait returns, Whose worth the splendors of thy race adorns, So may dread Jove (whose arm in vengeance forms The writhen bolt, and blackens heav'n with storms,) Restore me safe, thro' weary wand'rings tost, To my dear country's ever-pleasing coast, As while the spirit in this bosom glows, To thee, my Goddess, I address my vows; This may seem an extravagant compliment, especially in the mouth of the wise Ulysses, and rather prophane than polite. Dacier commends it as the highest piece of address and gallantry; but perhaps it may want explication to reconcile it to decency. Ulysses only speaks comparatively, and with relation to that one action of her saving his life: “As therefore, says he, I owe my thanks to the Heavens for giving me life originally, so I ought to pay my thanks to thee for preserving it; thou hast been to me as a Deity. To preserve a life, is in one sense to give it.” If this appears not to soften the expression sufficiently, it may be ascrib'd to an overflow of gratitude in the generous disposition of Ulysses; he is so touch'd with the memory of her benevolence and protection, that his soul labours for an expression great enough to represent it, and no wonder if in this struggle of thought, his words fly out into an excessive but laudable boldness. My life, thy gift I boast! He said, and sate Fast by Alcinous on a throne of state. Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares, Portions the food, and each his portion shares. The Bard an herald guides: the gazing throng Pay low obeysance as he moves along: Beneath a sculptur'd arch he sits enthron'd, The Peers encircling from an awful round. Then from the chine, Ulysses carves with art Were this literally to be translated, it would be, that Ulysses cut a piece from the chine of the white-tooth'd boar, round which there was much fat. This looks like Burlesque to a person unacquainted with the usages of Antiquity: But it was the highest honour that could be paid to Demodocus. The greatest Heroes in the Iliad are thus rewarded after victory, and it was esteem'd an equivalent for all dangers. So that what Ulysses here offers to the Poet, is offer'd out of a particular regard and honour to his Poetry. Delicious food, an honorary part; This, let the Master of the Lyre receive, A pledge of love! 'tis all a wretch can give. Lives there a man beneath the spacious skies, Who sacred honours to the Bard denies? The Muse the Bard inspires, exalts his mind; The Muse indulgent loves th'harmonious kind: The herald to his hand the charge conveys, Not fond of flattery, nor unpleas'd with praise. When now the rage of hunger was allay'd, Thus to the Lyrist wise Ulysses said. O more than man! thy soul the Muse inspires, Ulysses here ascribes the songs of Demodocus to immediate inspiration, and Apollo is made the patron of the Poets, as Eustathius observes, because he is the God of Prophecy. He adds, that Homer here again represents himself in the person of Demodocus: it is he who wrote the war of Troy with as much faithfulness, as if he had been present at it; it is he who had little or no assistance from former relations of that story, and consequently receives it from Apollo and the Muses. This is a secret but artful insinuation that we are not to look upon the Iliad as all fiction and fable, but in general as a real history, related with as much certainty as if the Poet had been present at those memorable actions. Plutarch in his chapter of reading Poems admires the conduct of Homer, with relation to Ulysses: He diverts Demodocus from idle fables, and gives him a noble theme, the destruction of Troy. Such subjects suit well with the sage character of Ulysses. It is for the same reason that he here passes over in silence the amour of Mars and Venus, and commends the song at the beginning of this book, concerning the contention of the worthies before Troy: An instruction, what songs a wise man ought to hear, and that Poets should recite nothing but what may be heard by a wise man. Or Phœbus animates with all his fires: For who by Phœbus uninform'd, could know The woe of Greece, and sing so well the woe? Just to the tale, as present at the fray, Or taught the labours of the dreadful day: The song recals past horrours to my eyes, And bids proud Ilion from her ashes rise. Once more harmonious strike the sounding string, Th'Epæan fabric, fram'd by Pallas, sing: How stern Ulysses, furious to destroy, With latent heroes sack'd imperial Troy. If faithful thou record the tale of fame, The God himself inspires thy breast with flame. And mine shall be the task, henceforth to raise In ev'ry land, thy monument of praise. Full of the God he rais'd his lofty strain, How the Greeks rush'd tumultuous to the main: How blazing tents illumin'd half the skies, While from the shores the winged navy flies: How ev'n in Ilion's walls, in deathful bands, Came the stern Greeks by Troy's assisting hands: All Troy up-heav'd the steed; of diff'ring mind, Various the Trojans counsell'd; part consign'd It is observable that the Poet gives us only the heads of this song, and though he had an opportunity to expatiate and introduce a variety of noble Images, by painting the fall of Troy, yet this being foreign to his story, he judiciously restrains his fancy, and passes on to the more immediate actions of the Odyssey. Virgil, lib. 2. of his Æneis, has translated these verses, Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus, At Capys, &amp; quorum melior sententia menti, Aut Pelago Danaum insidias suspectaque dona Præcipitare jubent, subjectisque urere flammis: Aut terebrare cavas uteri &amp; tentare latebras. Scaliger prefers these before those of Homer, and says that Homer trifles in describing so particularly the divisions of the Trojan councils: That Virgil chuses to burn the horse, rather than describe it as thrown from the rocks: For how should the Trojans raise it thither? Such objections are scarce worthy of a serious answer, for it is no difficulty to imagine that the same men who heaved this machine into Troy, should be able to raise it upon a rock: And as for the former objection, Virgil recites almost the same divisions in council as Homer, nay borrows them, with little variation. Aristotle observes the great art of Homer, in naturally bringing about the discovery of Ulysses to Alcinous by this song. He calls this a Remembrance, that is, when a present object stirs up a past image in the memory, as a picture recalls the figure of an absent friend: thus Ulysses hearing Demodocus sing to the harp his former hardships, breaks out into tears, and these tears bring about his discovery. The monster to the sword, part sentence gave To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave; Th'unwise award to lodge it in the tow'rs, An off'ring sacred to th'immortal pow'rs: Th'unwise prevail, they lodge it in the walls, And by the Gods decree proud Ilion falls; Destruction enters in the treach'rous wood, And vengeful slaughter, fierce for human blood. He sung the Greeks stern-issuing from the steed, How Ilion burns, how all her fathers bleed: How to thy dome, Deiphobus! ascends The Spartan King; how Ithacus attends, (Horrid as Mars) and how with dire alarms He fights, subdues: for Pallas strings his arms. Thus while he sung, Ulysses' griefs renew, Tears bathe his cheeks, and tears the ground bedew: As some fond matron views in mortal fight This is undoubtedly a very moving and beautiful comparison; but it may be ask'd if it be proper to compare so great a Heroe as Ulysses to a woman, the weakness of whose sex justifies her tears? Besides she appears to have a sufficient cause for her sorrows, as being under the greatest calamities, but why should Ulysses weep? Nothing but his valour and success is recorded, and why should this be an occasion of sorrow? Eustathius replies, that they who think that Ulysses is compared to the matron, mistake the point of the comparison: Whereas the tears alone of Ulysses are intended to be compared to the tears of the matron. It is the sorrow of the two persons, not the persons themselves, that is represented in the comparison. But there appears no sufficient cause for the tears of Ulysses; this objection would not have been made, if the subject of the song had been consider'd; it sets before his eyes all the calamities of a long war, all the scenes of slaughter of friends and enemies that he had beheld in it: It is also to be remember'd, that we have only the abridgment of the song, and yet we see spectacles of horror, blood, and commiseration. Tears discover a tender, not an abject spirit. Achilles is not less a Heroe for weeping over the ashes of Patroclus, nor Ulysses for lamenting the calamities and deaths of thousands of his friends. Her husband falling in his country's right: Frantic thro' clashing swords she runs, she flies, As ghastly pale he groans, and faints, and dies; Close to his breast she grovels on the ground, And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound; She cries, she shrieks: the fierce insulting foe Relentless mocks her violence of woe, To chains condemn'd as wildly she deplores, A widow, and a slave, on foreign shores! So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs: Conceal'd he griev'd: the King observ'd alone The silent tear, and heard the secret groan; Then to the Bard aloud: O cease to sing, Dumb be thy voice, and mute the tuneful string: To ev'ry note his tears responsive flow, And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe; Thy lay too deeply moves: then cease the lay, And o'er the banquet every heart be gay: This social right demands: for him the sails Floating in air, invite th'impelling gales: His are the gifts of love: The wise and good Receive the stranger as a brother's blood. But, friend, discover faithful what I crave, Artful concealment ill becomes the brave: Say what thy birth, and what the name you bore, Impos'd by parents in the natal hour? For from the natal hour distinctive names, (One common right, the great and lowly claims:) Say from what city, from what regions tost, And what inhabitants those regions boast? So shalt thou instant reach the realm assign'd, In wond'rous ships self-mov'd, instinct with mind; There is not a passage that more outrages all the rules of credibility than the description of these ships of Alcinous. The Poet inserts these wonders only to shew the great dexterity of the Phæacians in navigation; and indeed it was necessary to be very full in the description of their skill, who were to convey Ulysses home in despight of the very God of the Ocean. It is for the same reason that they are describ'd as sailing almost invisibly, to escape the notice of that God. Antiquity animated every thing in Poetry; thus Argo is said to have had a mast made of Dodonæan oak, indued with the faculty of speech. But this is defending one absurdity, by instancing in a fable equally absurd; all that can be said in defence of it is, that such extravagant fables were believ'd, at least by the vulgar, in former ages; and consequently might be introduced without blame in Poetry; if so, by whom could a boast of this nature be better made, than by a vain Phæacian? Besides, these extravagancies let Ulysses into the humour of the Phæacians, and in the following books he adapts his story to it, and returns fable for fable. It must likewise certainly be a great encouragement to Ulysses to find himself in such hands as could so easily restore him to his country; for it was natural to conclude, that though Alcinous was guilty of great amplification, yet that his subjects were very expert navigators. No helm secures their course, no pilot guides, Like man intelligent, they plow the tides, Conscious of every coast, and every bay, That lies beneath the sun's all-seeing ray; Tho' clouds and darkness veil th'encumber'd sky, Fearless thro' darkness and thro' clouds they fly: Tho' tempests rage, tho' rolls the swelling main, The seas may roll, the tempests rage in vain, Ev'n the stern God that o'er the waves presides, Safe as they pass, and safe repass the tides, With fury burns; while careless they convey Promiscuous every guest to every bay. These ears have heard my royal sire disclose A dreadful story big with future woes, How Neptune rag'd, and how by his command The Antients, as Eustathius observes, mark these verses with an Obelisk and Asterism. The Obelisk shew'd that they judg'd what relates to the oracle was mis-plac'd, the Asterism denoted that they thought the verses very beautiful. For they thought it not probable that Alcinous would have call'd to memory this prediction and the menace of Neptune, and yet persisted to conduct to his own country the enemy of that Deity: Whereas if this oracle be supposed to be forgotten by Alcinous, (as it will, if these verses be taken away) then there will be an appearance of truth, that he who was a friend to all strangers, should be persuaded to land so great and worthy a Heroe as Ulysses in his own dominions, and therefore they reject them to the 13?? of the Odyssey. But as Eustathius observes, Alcinous immediately subjoins, But this the Gods may frustrate or fulfill, As suits the purpose of th'eternal will. And therefore the verses may be very proper in this book, for Alcinous believes that the Gods might be prevailed upon not to fulfill this denunciation. It has been likewise remark'd that the conduct of Alcinous is very justifiable: The Phæacians had been warn'd by an oracle, that an evil threaten'd them for the care they should shew to a stranger: yet they forbear not to perform an act of piety to Ulysses, being persuaded that men ought to do their duty, and trust the issue to the goodness of the Gods. This will seem to be more probable, if we remember Alcinous is ignorant that Ulysses is the person intended by the prediction, so that he is not guilty of a voluntary opposition to the Gods, but really acts with piety in assisting his guest, and only complies with the common laws of hospitality. It is but a conjecture, yet it is not without probability, that there was a rock which look'd like a vessel, in the entrance of the haven of the Phæacians: the fable may be built upon this foundation, and because it was environ'd by the ocean, the transformation might be ascrib'd to the God of it. Firm rooted in the surge a ship should stand A monument of wrath: how mound on mound The Greek word is ????????????, which does not necessarily imply that the city should be buried actually, but that a mountain should surround it, or cover it round; and in the 13?? book we find that when the ship was transform'd into a rock, the city continues out of danger. Eustathius is fully of opinion, that the city was threaten'd to be overwhelm'd by a mountain; the Poet, says he, invents this fiction to prevent posterity from searching after this Isle of the Phæacians, and to preserve his story from detection of falsification; after the same manner as he introduces Neptune and the rivers of Troy, bearing away the wall which the Greeks had rais'd as a fortification before their navy. But Dacier in the omissions which she inserts at the end of the second volume of her Odyssey, is of a contrary opinion, for the mountain is not said to cover the city, but to threaten to cover it: as appears from the 13?? book of the Odyssey, where Alcinous commands a sacrifice to the Gods to avert the execution of this denunciation. But the difference in reality is small, the city is equally threaten'd to be buried as the vessel to be transform'd; and therefore Alcinous might pronounce the same fate to both, since both were threaten'd equally by the prediction; it was indeed impossible for him to speak after any other manner, for he only repeats the words of the oracle, and cannot foresee that the sacrifice of the Phæacians would appease the anger of Neptune, Should bury these proud tow'rs beneath the ground. But this the Gods may frustrate or fulfill, As suits the purpose of th'eternal will. But say thro' what waste regions hast thou stray'd, What customs noted, and what coasts survey'd? Possest by wild barbarians fierce in arms, Or men, whose bosom tender pity warms? Say why the fate of Troy awak'd thy cares, Why heav'd thy bosom, and why flow'd thy tears? Just are the ways of heav'n: From heav'n proceed The woes of man; heav'n doom'd the Greeks to bleed, A theme of future song! Say then if slain Some dear-lov'd brother press'd the Phrygian plain? Or bled some friend? who bore a brother's part, This excellent sentence of Homer at once guides us in the choice, and instructs us in the regard, that is to be paid to the person of a Friend. If it be lawful to judge of a man from his writings, Homer had a soul susceptible of real friendship, and was a lover of sincerity. It would be endless to take notice of every casual instruction inserted in the Odyssey; but such sentences shew Homer to have been a man of an amiable character, as well as excellent in Poetry: The great abhorrence he had of Lies cannot be more strongly exprest than in those two passages in the ninth Iliad, and in the 14?? Odyssey: In the first of which he makes the man of the greatest soul, Achilles, bear testimony to his aversion of them; and in the latter declares, that “the poorest man, tho' compell'd by the utmost necessity, ought not to stoop to such a practice”. In this place he shews that worth creates a kind of relation, and that we are to look upon a worthy friend as a brother. This book takes up the whole thirty third day, and part of the evening: for the council opens in the morning, and at sun setting the Phæacians return to the Palace from the games; after which Ulysses bathes and sups, and spends some time of the evening in discoursing, and hearing the songs of Demodocus. Then Alcinous requests him to relate his own story, which he begins in the next book, and continues it thro' the four subsequent books of the Odyssey. And claim'd by merit, not by blood, the heart. THE NINTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The adventures of the Cicons, Lotophagi, and Cyclops. Ulysses begins the relation of his adventures; how after the destruction of Troy, he made an incursion on the Cicons, by whom they were repuls'd; and meeting with a storm, were driven to the coast of the Lotophagi. From thence they sail'd to the land of the Cyclops, whose manners and situation are particularly characteris'd. The Giant Polyphemus and his cave describ'd; the usage Ulysses and his companions met there; and lastly, the method and artifice by which he escaped. As we are now come to the Episodical part of the Odyssey, it may be thought necessary to speak something of the nature of Episodes. As the action of the Epic is always one, entire, and great Action; so the most trivial Episodes must be so interwoven with it, as to be necessary parts, or convenient, as Mr. Dryden observes, to carry on the main design; either so necessary, as without them the Poem must be imperfect, or so convenient, that no others can be imagin'd more suitable to the place in which they stand: There is nothing to be left void in a firm building, even the cavities ought not to be fill'd up with rubbish destructive to the strength of it, but with materials of the same kind, tho' of less pieces, and fitted to the main fabric. Aristotle tells us, that what is comprehended in the first platform of the fable is proper, the rest is Episode: Let us examine the Odyssey by this rule: The groundwork of the Poem is, a Prince absent from his country several years, Neptune hinders his return, yet at last he breaks thro' all obstacles, and returns, where he finds great disorders, the Authors of which he punishes, and restores peace to his kingdoms. This is all that is essential to the model; this the Poet is not at liberty to change; this is so necessary, that any alteration destroys the design, spoils the fable, and makes another Poem of it. But Episodes are changeable; for instance, tho' it was necessary that Ulysses being absent should spend several years with foreign Princes, yet it was not necessary that one of these Princes should be Antiphates, another Alcinous, or that Circe or Calypso should be the persons who entertain'd him: It was in the Poet's choice to have chang'd these persons and states, without changing his design or fable. Thus tho' these adventures or Episodes become parts of the subject after they are chosen, yet they are not originally essential to the subject. But in what sense then are they necessary? The reply is, Since the absence of Ulysses was absolutely necessary, it follows that not being at home, he must be in some other country; and therefore tho' the Poet was at liberty to make use of none of these particular adventures, yet it was not in his choice to make use of none at all; if these had been omitted, he must have substituted others, or else he would have omitted part of the matter contain'd in his model, viz. the adventures of a person long absent from his country; and the Poem would have been defective. So that Episodes are not actions, but parts of an action. It is in Poetry, as Aristotle observes, as in Painting; a Painter puts many actions into one piece, but they all conspire to form one entire and perfect Action: A Poet likewise uses many Episodes, but all those Episodes taken separately finish nothing, they are but imperfect members, which all together make one and the same action, like the parts of a human body, they all conspire to constitute the whole man. In a word, the Episodes of Homer are compleat Episodes; they are proper to the subject, because they are drawn from the ground of the fable; they are so join'd to the principal action, that one is the necessary consequence of the other, either truly or probably: and lastly, they are imperfect members which do not make a compleat and finish'd body; for an Episode that makes a compleat action, cannot be part of a principal action, as is essential to all Episodes. An Episode may then be defin'd, “a necessary part of an action, extended by probable circumstances.” They are part of an action, for they are not added to the principal action, but only dilate and amplify that principal action: Thus the Poet to shew the sufferings of Ulysses brings in the several Episodes of Polyphemus, Scylla, the Sirens, &amp;c. But why should the words “extended by probable circumstances” enter the definition? Because the Sufferings of Ulysses are propos'd in the model of the Fable in general only, but by relating the circumstances, the manner how he is discover'd, and this connects it with the principal action, and shews very evidently the necessary relation the Episode bears to the main design of the Odyssey. What I have said I hope plainly discovers the difference between the Episodic and Principal action, as well as the nature of Episodes. See Bossu more largely upon this subject. Then thus Ulysses. Thou, whom first in sway As first in virtue, these thy realms obey! How sweet the products of a peaceful reign? This passage has given great joy to the Critics, as it has afforded them the ill natur'd pleasure of railing, and the satisfaction of believing they have found a fault in a good Writer. It is fitter, say they, for the mouth of Epicurus than for the sage Ulysses, to extol the pleasures of feasting and drinking in this manner: He whom the Poet proposes as the standard of human Wisdom, says Rapine, suffers himself to be made drunk by the Phæacians. But it may rather be imagin'd, that the Critic was not very sober when he made the reflection; for there is not the least appearance of a reason for that imputation. Plato indeed in his third book de Repub. writes, that what Ulysses here speaks is no very proper example of temperance: but every body knows that Plato, with respect to Homer, wrote with great partiality. Athenæus in his twelfth book gives us the following interpretation. Ulysses accommodates his discourse to the present occasion; he in appearance approves of the voluptuous lives of the Phæacians, and having heard Alcinous before say, that feasting and singing, &amp;c. was their supreme delight; he by a seasonable flattery seems to comply with their inclinations: it being the most proper method to attain his desires of being convey'd to his own country. He compares Ulysses to the Polypus, which is fabled to assume the colour of every rock to which he approaches: Thus Sophocles, ???? ???? ????? ???? ????????, ???? ????? ????????? ??????? ??????????. That is “In your accesses to mankind observe the Polypus, and adapt your self to the humour of the person to whom you apply. Eustathius observes that this passage has been condemn'd, but he defends it after the very same way with Athæneus. It is not impossible but that there may be some compliance with the nature and manners of the Phæacians, especially because Ulysses is always describ'd as an artful man, not without some mixture of dissimulation: But it is no difficult matter to take the passage literally, and yet give it an irreproachable sense. Ulysses had gone thro' innumerable calamities, he had liv'd to see a great part of Europe and Asia laid desolate by a bloody war; and after so many troubles, he arrives among a nation that was unacquainted with all the miseries of war, where all the people were happy, and pass'd their lives in ease and pleasures: this calm life fills him with admiration, and he artfully praises what he found praise-worthy in it; namely, the entertainments and music, and passes over the gallantries of the people, as Dacier observes, without any mention. Maximus Tyrius fully vindicates Homer. It is my opinion, says that Author, that the Poet, by representing these guests in the midst of their entertainment, delighted with the song and music, intended to recommend a more noble pleasure than eating or drinking, such a pleasure as a wise man may imitate, by approving the better part, and rejecting the worse, and chusing to please the ear rather than the belly. 12 Dissert. If we understand the passage otherwise, the meaning may be this. I am persuaded, says Ulysses, that the most agreeable end which a King can propose, is to see a whole nation in universal joy, when music and feastings are in every house, when plenty is on every table, and wines to entertain every guest; This to me appears a state of the greatest felicity. In this sense Ulysses pays Alcinous a very agreeable compliment; as it is certainly the most glorious aim of a King to make his subjects happy, and diffuse an universal joy thro' this dominions: He must be a rigid Censor indeed who blames such pleasures as these, which have nothing contrary in them to Virtue and strict Morality; especially as they here bear a beautiful opposition to all the horrors which Ulysses had seen in the wars of Troy, and shew Phæacia as happy as Troy was miserable. I will only add, that this agrees with the oriental way of speaking; and in the Poetical parts of the Scriptures, the voice of melody, feasting, and dancing, are used to express the happiness of a nation. The heav'n-taught Poet, and enchanting strain: The well-fill'd palace, the perpetual feast, A land rejoicing, and a people blest. How goodly seems it, ever to employ Man's social days in union, and in joy? The plenteous board high-heap'd with cates divine, And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine. Amid these joys, why seeks thy mind to know Th'unhappy series of a wand'rer's woe? Remembrance sad, whose image to review Alas! must open all my wounds anew. And oh, what first, what last shall I relate, Of woes unnumber'd sent by Heav'n and Fate? Know first the man (tho' now a wretch distrest) Who hopes thee, Monarch! for his future guest. Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name, The Poet begins with declaring the name of Ulysses: the Phæacians had already been acquainted with it by the song of Demodocus, and therefore it could not fail of raising the utmost attention and curiosity (as Eustathius observes) of the whole assembly, to hear the story of so great an Heroe. Perhaps it may be thought that Ulysses is ostentatious, and speaks of himself too favourably; but the necessity of it will appear, if we consider that Ulysses had nothing but his personal qualifications to engage the Phæacians in his favour. It was therefore requisite to make those qualifications known, and this was not possible to be done but by his own relation, he being a stranger among strangers. Besides, he speaks before a vain-glorious people, who thought even boasting no fault. It may be question'd whether Virgil be so happy in these respects, when he puts almost the same words into the mouth of Æneas. Sum pius Æneas, raptos qui ex hoste penates Classe veho mecum, famâ super æthera notus. For his boast contributes nothing to the re-establishment of his affairs, for he speaks to the Goddess Venus. Yet Scaliger infinitely prefers Virgil before Homer, tho' there be no other difference in the words, than raptos qui ex hoste penates, instead of ? ?? ???? ???????? ?????????? ????. ? He questions whether Subtilties, or ?????, ever rais'd any person's glory to the Heavens; whereas that is the reward of piety. But the word is to be understood to imply Wisdom, and all the stratagems of war, &amp;c. according to the first verse of the Odyssey, The Man for Wisdom's various arts renown'd. He is not less severe upon the verses immediately preceding, ??? ?? ??? ????? ????? ?????????? ?????????, &amp;c. which lines are undoubtedly very beautiful, and admirably express the number of the sufferings of Ulysses; the multitude of them is so great, and they almost confound him; and he seems at a loss where to begin, how to proceed, or where to end; and they agree very well with the proposition in the opening of the Odyssey, which was to relate the sufferings of a brave man. The verses which Scaliger quotes are Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem; Trojanas ut opes, &amp;c. Omnia sanè non sine suâ divinitate, and he concludes, that Virgil has not so much imitated Homer, as taught us how Homer ought to have wrote. Earth sounds my wisdom, and high heav'n my fame. My native soil is Ithaca the fair, Eustathius gives various interpretations of this position of Ithaca; some understand it to signify that it lies low; others explain it to signify that it is of a low position, but high with respect to the neighbouring Islands; others take ???????????? (excellentissima) in another sense to imply the excellence of the country, which tho' it lies low, is productive of brave inhabitants, for Homer immediately adds ????? ???????????. Strabo gives a different exposition; Ithaca is ???????, as it lies near to the Continent, and ???????????, as it is the utmost of all the islands towards the North, ???? ??????, for thus ???? ????? is to be understood. So that Ithaca, adds he, is not of a low situation, but as it lies oppos'd to the Continent, nor the most lofty (?????????) but the most extream of the northern Islands; for so ??????????? signifies. Dacier differs from Strabo in the explication of ???? ?? ?? ?????? ??, which he believes to mean the South; she applies the words to the East, or South-east, and appeals to the maps which so describe it. It is the most northern of the Islands, and joyns to the Continent of Epirus; it has Dulichium on the East, and on the South Samos and Zacynthus. Where high Neritus waves his woods in air: Dulichium, Samè, and Zacynthus crown'd With shady mountains, spread their isles around. (These to the north and night's dark regions run, Those to Aurora and the rising sun.) Low lies our Isle, yet blest in fruitful stores; Strong are her sons, tho' rocky are her shores; And none, ah none so lovely to my sight, Of all the lands that heav'n o'erspreads with light! In vain Calypso long constrain'd my stay, Eustathius observes, that Ulysses repeats his refusal of the Goddess Calypso and Circe in the same words, to shew Alcinous, by a secret denial, that he could not be induc'd to stay from his country, or marry his daughter: He calls Circe ????????, because she is skill'd in magical Incantations: He describes Ithaca with all its inconveniencies, to convince Alcinous of his veracity, and that he will not deceive him in other circumstances, when he gives so disadvantageous a character of a country for which he expresses so great a fondness; and lastly, in relating the death of his friends, he seems to be guilty of a tautology, in ??????? ?? ????? ??. But Aulus Gellius gives us the reason of it, Atrocitatem rei bis idem dicendo auxit, inculcavitque, non igitur illa ejusdem significationis repetitio, ignava &amp;c frigida videri debet. With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay; With all her charms as vainly Circe strove, And added magick, to secure my love. In pomps or joys, the palace or the grott My country's image never was forgot, My absent parents rose before my sight, And distant lay contentment and delight. Hear then the woes, which mighty Jove ordain'd To wait my passage from the Trojan land. The winds from Ilion to the Cicons' shore, Here is the natural and true beginning of the Odyssey, which comprehends all the sufferings of Ulysses, and these sufferings take their date immediately after his leaving the shores of Troy; from that moment he endeavours to return to his own country, and all the difficulties he meets with in returning, enter into the subject of the Poem. But it may then be ask'd, if the Odyssey does not take up the space of ten years, since Ulysses wastes so many in his return; and is not this contrary to the nature of Epic Poetry, which is agreed must not at the longest exceed the duration of one year, or rather Campaign? The answer is, the Poet lets all the time pass which exceeds the bounds of Epic action, before he opens the Poem; thus Ulysses spends some time before he arrives at the Island of Circe, with her he continues one year, and seven with Calypso; he begins artificially at the conclusion of the action, and finds an opportunity to repeat the most considerable and necessary incidents which preceded the opening of the Odyssey; by this method he reduces the duration of it into less compass than the space of two months. This conduct is absolutely necessary, for from the time that the Poet introduces his Heroe upon the stage, he ought to continue his action to the very end of it, that he may never afterwards appear idle or out of motion: This is verified in Ulysses; from the moment he leaves the Island Ogygia to the death of the Suitors, he is never out of view, never idle; he is always either in action, or preparing for it, 'till he is re-establish'd in his dominions. If the Poet had follow'd the natural order of the action, he, like Lucan, would not have wrote an Epic Poem, but an History in verse. Beneath cold Ismarus, our vessels bore. We boldly landed on the hostile place, And sack'd the city, and destroy'd the race, The Poet assigns no reason why Ulysses destroys this City of the Ciconians, but we may learn from the Iliad, that they were auxiliaries of Troy, Book the second. With great Euphemus the Ciconians move, Sprung from Trœzenian Cœus, lov'd of Jove. And therefore Ulysses assaults them as enemies. Eustathius. Their wives made captive, their possessions shar'd, And ev'ry soldier found a like reward. I then advis'd to fly; not so the rest, Who stay'd to revel, and prolong the feast: The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay, And bowls flow round, and riot wastes the day. Mean-time the Cicons, to their holds retir'd, Call on the Cicons, with new fury fir'd; With early morn the gather'd country swarms, And all the Continent is bright with arms: Thick, as the budding leaves or rising flow'rs O'erspread the land, when spring descends in show'rs: All expert soldiers, skill'd on foot to dare, Or from the bounding courser urge the war. Now Fortune changes (so the sates ordain) Our hour was come, to taste our share of pain. Close at the ships the bloody fight began, Wounded they wound, and man expires on man. Long as the morning sun increasing bright O'er heav'n's pure azure spread the growing light, Promiscuous death the form of war confounds, Each adverse battel gor'd with equal wounds: But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main, Then conquest crown'd the fierce Ciconian train. Six brave companions from each ship we lost, This is one of the passages which fell under the censure of Zoilus; it is very improbable, says that Critic that each vessel shoud lose six men exactly, this seems a too equal distribution to be true, considering the chance of battle. But it has been answer'd, that Ulysses had twelve vessels, and that in this engagement he lost seventy two soldiers; so that the meaning is, that taking the total of his loss, and dividing it equally thro' the whole fleet, he found it amounted exactly to six men in every vessel. This will appear to be a true solution, if we remember that there was a necessity to supply the loss of any one ship out of the others that had suffer'd less; so that tho' one vessel lost more than the rest, yet being recruited equally from the rest of the fleet, there would be exactly six men wanting in every vessel. Eustathius. The rest escape in haste, and quit the coast. With sails outspread we fly th'unequal strife, Sad for their loss, but joyful of our life. Yet as we fled, our fellows rites we pay'd, And thrice we call'd on each unhappy Shade. This passage preserves a piece of Antiquity: It was the custom of the Grecians, when their friends dy'd upon foreign shores, to use this ceremony of recalling their souls, tho' they obtain'd not their bodies; believing by this method that they transported them to their own country: Pindar mentions the same practice, ??????? ??? ??? ????? ??????? ??????, &amp;c. That is, “Phrixus commands thee to call his soul into his own country:” Thus the Athenians, when they lost any men at sea, went to the shores, and calling thrice on their names, rais'd a Cenotaph or empty monument to their memories; by performing which solemnity, they invited the shades of the departed to return, and perform'd all rites as if the bodies of the dead had really been buried by them in their sepulchres. Eustathius. The Romans as well as the Greeks follow'd the same custom: thus Virgil, ? Et magnâ Manes ter voce vocavi. The occasion of this practice arose from the opinion, that the souls of the departed were not admitted into the state of the happy, without the performance of the sepulchral solemnities. Mean-while the God whose hand the thunder forms, Drives clouds on clouds, and blackens heav'n with storms: Wide o'er the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps, And Night rush'd headlong on the shaded deeps. Now here, now there, the giddy ships are born, And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn. We furl'd the sail, we ply'd the lab'ring oar, Took down our masts, and row'd our ships to shore. Two tedious days and two long nights we lay, O'erwatch'd and batter'd in the naked bay. But the third morning when Aurora brings, We rear the masts, we spread the canvas wings; Refresh'd, and careless on the deck reclin'd, We sit, and trust the pilot and the wind. Then to my native country had I sail'd; But, the cape doubled, adverse winds prevail'd. Strong was the tyde, which by the northern blast Impell'd, our vessels on Cythera cast. Nine days our fleet th'uncertain tempest bore Far in wide ocean, and from sight of shore: The tenth we touch'd, by various errors tost, This passage has given occasion for much controversy; for since the Lotophagi in reality are distant from the Malean Cape twenty two thousand five hundred stades, Ulysses must sail above two thousand every day, if in nine days he sail'd to the Lotophagi. This objection would be unanswerable, if we place that nation in the Atlantic Ocean, but Dacier observes from Strabo, that Polybius examin'd this point, and thus give us the result of it. This great Historian maintains, that Homer has not placed the Lotophagi in the Atlantic Ocean, as he does the Islands of Circe and Calypso, because it was improbable that in the compass of ten days the most favourable winds could have carry'd Ulysses from the Malean Cape into that Ocean; it therefore follows, that the Poet has given us the true situation of this nation, conformably to Geography and placed it as it really lies in the Mediterranean; now in ten days a good wind will carry a vessel from Malea into the Mediterranean, as Homer relates. This is an instance that Homer sometimes follows truth without fiction, at other times disguises it. But I confess I think Homer's Poetry would have been as beautiful if he had describ'd all his Islands in their true positions: His inconstancy in this point, may seem to introduce confusion and ambiguity, when the truth would have been more clear, and as beautiful in his Poetry. Nothing can better shew the great deference which former ages pay'd Homer, than these defences of the learned Ancients; they continually ascribe his deviations from truth, (as in the instance before us) to design, not to ignorance; to his art as a Poet, and not to want of skill as a Geographer. In a writer of less fame, such relations might be thought errors, but in Homer they are either understood to be no errors, or if errors, they are vindicated by the greatest names of Antiquity. Eustathius adds, that the Ancients disagree about this Island: some place it about Cyrene, from Maurusia of the African Moors: It is also named Meninx, and lies upon the African coast, near the lesser Syrte. It is about three hundred and fifty stades in length, and somewhat less in breadth: It is also nam'd Lotophagitis from Lotos. The land of Lotos, and the flow'ry coast. We climb'd the beach, and springs of water found, Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground. Three men were sent, deputed from the crew, (An herald one) the dubious coast to view, The reason why the Poet mentions the Herald in particular, is because his office was sacred; and by the common law of nations his person inviolable: Ulysses therefore joyns an Herald in this commission, for the greater security of those whom he sends to search the country. Eustathius. And learn what habitants possest the place. They went, and found a hospitable race: Not prone to ill, nor strange to foreign guest, They eat, they drink, and nature gives the feast; The trees around them all their food produce, Lotos the name, divine, nectareous juice! Eustathius assures us, that there are various kinds of it. It has been a question whether it is a herb, a root, or a tree: He is of opinion, that Homer speaks of it as an herb; for he calls it ??????? ?????, and that the word ?????????? is in its proper sense apply'd to the grazing of beasts, and therefore he judges it not to be a tree, or root. He adds, there is an Ægyptian Lotos, which, as Herodotus affirms, grows in great abundance along the Nile in the time of its inundations; it resembles (says that Historian in his Enterpe) a Lily, the Ægyptians dry it in the sun, then take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it as bread: this kind of it agrees likewise with the ??????? ????? of Homer. Athenæus writes of the Lybian Lotos in the fourteenth book of his Deipnosophist; he qoutes the words of Polybius in the twelfth book of his History, now not extant; that Historian speaks of it as an eye-witness, having examin'd the nature of it. “The Lotos is a tree of no great height, rough and thorny: it bears a green leaf, somewhat thicker and broader than that of the bramble or briar; its fruit at first is like the ripe berries of the Myrtle, both in size and colour, but when it ripens it turns to purple; it is then about the bigness of an olive, it is round, and contains a very small kernel; when it is ripe they gather it, and bruising it among bread-corn, they put it up into a vessel, and keep it as food for their slaves; they dress it after the same manner for their other domestics, but first take out the kernel from it: It has the taste of a fig, or dates, but is of a far better smell: They likewise make a wine of it, by steeping and bruising it in water; it has a very agreeable taste, like wine temper'd with honey. They drink it without mixing it with water, but it will not keep above ten days, they therefore make it only in small quantities for immediate use.” Perhaps it was this last kind of Lotos, which the companions of Ulysses tasted; and if it was thus prepar'd, it gives a reason why they were overcome with it; for being a wine, it had the power of intoxication. (Thence call'd Lotophagi) which whoso tastes, Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts, Nor other home nor other care intends, But quits his house, his country, and his friends: The three we sent, from off th'inchanting ground We dragg'd reluctant, and by force we bound: The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore, Or, the charm tasted, had return'd no more. It must be confess'd, that the effects of this Lotos are extraordinary, and seem fabulous: How then shall we reconcile the relation to credibility? The foundation of it might perhaps be no more than this; The companions of Ulysses might be willing to settle among these Lotophagi, being won by the pleasure of the place, and tired with a life of danger and the perils of seas. Or perhaps it is only an Allegory, to teach us that those who indulge themselves in pleasures, are with difficulty withdrawn from them, and want an Ulysses to lead them by a kind of violence into the paths of glory. Now plac'd in order, on their banks they sweep The sea's smooth face, and cleave the hoary deep; With heavy hearts we labour thro' the tyde, To coasts unknown, and oceans yet untry'd. The land of Cyclops first; a savage kind, Homer here confines himself to the true Geography of Sicily: for, in reality, a ship may easily sail in one day from the land of the Lotophagi to Sicily: These Cyclops inhabited the western part of that Island, about Drepane and Lilybæum. Bochart shews us, that they derive their name from the place of their habitation; for the Phæacians call them Chek-lub, by contraction for Chek-lelub; that is, the gulph of Lilybæum, or the men who dwell about the Lilybæan gulph. The Greeks (who understood not the Phæacian language) form'd the word Cyclop, from Chek-lub, from the affinity of sound; which word in the Greek language, signifying a circular eye, might give occasion to fable that they had but one large round eye in the middle of their foreheads. Dacier. Eustathius tells us, that the eye of Cyclops is an allegory, to represent that in anger, or any other violent passion, men see but one single object, as that passion directs, or see but with one eye: ??? ?? ??, ??? ????? ?????: and that passion transforms us into a kind of savages, and makes us brutal and sanguinary, like this Polypheme; and he that by reason extinguishes such a passion, may like Ulysses be said to put out that eye that made him see but one single object. I have already given another reason of this fiction; namely their wearing a headpiece, or martial Vizor that had but one sight thro' it. The vulgar form their judgments from appearances; and a mariner, who pass'd these coasts at a distance, observing the resemblance of a broad eye in the forehead of one of these Cyclops, might relate it accordingly, and impose it as a truth upon the credulity of the ignorant: it is notorious that things equally monstrous have found belief in all ages. But it may be ask'd if there were any such persons who bore the name of Cyclops? No less an Historian than Thucydides informs us, that Sicily was at first possess'd and inhabited by Giants, by the Læstrigons and Cyclops, a barbarous and inhuman people: But he adds, that these savages dwelt only in one part of that Island. Cedrenus gives us an exact description of the Cyclops: ??????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ?? ??????? ??? ??? ???????, &amp;c. “Ulysses fell among the Cyclops in Sicily, a people not one-ey'd, according to the Mythologists, but men like other men, only of a more gigantic stature, and of a barbarous and savage temper.” From this description, we may see what Homer writes as a Poet, and what as an Historian; he paints these people in general agreeably to their persons, only disguises some features, to give an ornament to his relation, and to introduce the Marvellous, which demands a place chiefly in Epic Poetry. What Homer speaks of the fertility of Sicily, is agreeable to History: It was call'd anciently Romani Imperii Horreum. Pliny, lib. 10. cap. 10. writes, that the Leontine plains bear for every grain of corn, an hundred. Diodorus Siculus relates in his History what Homer speaks in Poetry, that the fields of Leontium yield wheat without the culture of the husbandman: he was an eye-witness, being a native of the Island. From hence in general it may be observ'd, that where-ever we can trace Homer, we find, if not historic truth, yet the resemblance of it; that is, as plain truth as can be related without converting his Poem into an History. Nor tam'd by manners, nor by laws confin'd: Untaught to plant, to turn the glebe and sow, They all their products to free nature owe. The soil untill'd a ready harvest yields, With wheat and barley wave the golden fields, Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour, And Jove descends in each prolific show'r. By these no statutes and no rights are known, Plato (observes Spondanus) in his third book of laws, treats of Government as practis'd in the first ages of the world; and refers to this passage of Homer; “Mankind was originally independant, every Master of a family was a kind of a King of his family, and reign'd over his wife and children like these Cyclopeans,” according to the expression of Homer, ?????? ?? ???? ?????? ??????????, ???? ????????. Aristotle likewise complains, that even in his times, in many places, men lived without laws, according to their own fancies, ?? ??????? ?? ????????, ?????????? ??????????, ??????, ? ??????, referring likewise to this passage of Homer. Dacier adds from Plato, that after the Deluge, three manners of life succeeded among mankind; the first was rude and savage; men were afraid of a second flood, and therefore inhabited the summits of mountains, without any dependance upon one another, and each was absolute in his own family: The second was less brutal; as the fear of the Deluge wore away by degrees, they descended toward the bottom of mountains, and began to have some intercourse: The third was more polish'd; when a full security from the apprehensions of a flood was establish'd by time, they then began to inhabit the plains, and a more general commerce by degrees prevailing, they enter'd into societies, and establish'd laws for the general good of the whole community. These Cyclopeans maintain'd the first state of life in the days of Ulysses; they had no intercourse with other societies, by reason of their barbarities, and consequently their manners were not at all polish'd by the general laws of humanity. This account agrees excellently with the holy Scriptures, and perhaps Plato borrow'd it from the writings of Moses; after the Deluge men retreated to mountains for fear of a second flood; their chief riches, like these Cyclopeans, consisted in flocks and herds; and every master of a family ruled his house without any controul or subordination. No council held, no Monarch fills the throne, But high on hills or airy cliffs they dwell, This is said, to give an air of probability to the revenge which Ulysses takes upon this giant, and indeed to the whole story. He describes his solitary life, to shew that he was utterly destitute of assistance; and it is for the same reason, continues Eustathius, that the Poet relates that he left his fleet under a desart neighbouring Island, namely to make it probable, that the Cyclops could not seize it, or pursue Ulysses, having no shipping. Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell. Each rules his race, his neighbour not his care, Heedless of others, to his own severe. Oppos'd to the Cyclopean coasts, there lay An Isle, whose hills their subject fields survey; This little Isle is now call'd Ægusa, which signifies the Isle of goats. Cluverius describes it after the manner of Homer, Prata mollia, &amp; irrigua, solum fertile, portum commodum, fontes limpidos. It is not certain whether the Poet gives any name to it; perhaps it had not received any in these ages, it being without inhabitants; tho' some take ?????? for a proper name, as is observ'd by Eustathius. Its name Lachæa, crown'd with many a grove, Where savage goats thro' pathless thickets rove: No needy mortals here, with hunger bold, Or wretched hunters thro' the wint'ry cold Pursue their flight, but leave them safe to bound From hill to hill, o'er all the desart ground. Nor knows the soil to feed the fleecy care, Or feels the labours of the crooked share, But uninhabited, untill'd, unsown It lies, and breeds the bleating goat alone. It is exactly thus in the original, ver. 124. ???????, balantes; which Pollux, lib. 5. observes not to be the proper term for the voice of goats, which is ?????????. For there no vessel with vermilion prore, Or bark of traffic, glides from shore to shore; The rugged race of savages, unskill'd The seas to traverse, or the ships to build, Gaze on the coast, nor cultivate the soil, Unlearn'd in all th'industrious arts of toil. Yet here all products and all plants abound, Sprung from the fruitful genius of the ground; Fields waving high with heavy crops are seen, And vines that flourish in eternal green, Refreshing meads along the murm'ring main, And fountains streaming down the fruitful plain. A port there is, inclos'd on either side, Where ships may rest, unanchor'd and unty'd; 'Till the glad mariners incline to sail, And the sea whitens with the rising gale. High at its head, from out the cavern'd rock In living rills a gushing fountain broke: Around it, and above, for ever green The bushing alders form'd a shady scene. Hither some fav'ring God, beyond our thought, This circumstance is inserted with great judgment, Ulysses otherwise might have landed in Sicily, and fall'n into the hands of the Cyclopeans, and consequently been lost inevitably: He therefore piously ascribes his safety, be being driven upon this desolate Island, to the guidance of the Gods; he uses it as a retreat, leaves his navy there, and passes over into Sicily in one single vessel, undiscover'd by these gigantic savages; this reconciles the relation to probability, and renders his escape practicable. Eustathius. Thro' all-surrounding shade our navy brought; For gloomy Night descended on the main, Nor glimmer'd Phœbe in th'ethereal plain: But all unseen the clouded Island lay, And all unseen the surge and rowling sea, 'Till safe we anchor'd in the shelter'd bay: Our sails we gather'd, cast our cables o'er, And slept secure along the sandy shore. Soon as again the rosy morning shone, Reveal'd the landscape and the scene unknown, With wonder seiz'd we view the pleasing ground, And walk delighted, and expatiate round. Rows'd by the woodland nymphs, at early dawn, This passage is not without obscurity, and it is not easy to understand what is meant by the daughters of Jupiter. Eustathius tells us, the Poet speaks allegorically, and that he means to specify the plants and herbs of the field. Jupiter denotes the air, not only in Homer, but in the Latin Poets. Thus Virgil, Tum pater omnipotens fœcundis imbribus Æther Conjugis in gremium lætæ descendit? and consequently the herbs and plants, being nourish'd by the mild air and fruitful rains, may be said to be the daughters of Jupiter, or offspring of the skies; and these goats and beasts of the field, being fed by these plants and herbs, may be said to be awaken'd by the daughters of Jupiter, that is, they awake to feed upon the herbage early in the morning. ?????? ????, ??????????? ?? ??? ????? ????????? ????????, ?? ? ???? ?????. Thus Homer makes Deities of the vegetative faculties and virtues of the field. I fear such boldnesses would not be allow'd in modern Poetry. It must be confess'd that this interpretation is very refin'd: But I am sure it will be a more natural explication to take these for the real mountain Nymphs (Oreades) as they are in many places of the Odyssey; the very expression is found in the sixth book, ? ?????? ?????? ???? ? and there signifies the Nymphs attending upon Diana in her sports: Immediately after, Ulysses, being awaken'd by a sudden noise, mistakes Nausicaa and her damsels for Nymphs of the mountains or floods; and this conjecture will not be without probability, if we remember that these Nymphs were huntresses, as is evident from their relation to Diana. Why then may not the other expression be meant of the Nymphs that are fabled to inhabit the mountains? The mountain goats came bounding o'er the lawn: In haste our fellows to the ships repair, For arms and weapons of the sylvan war; Strait in three squadrons all our crew we part, And bend the bow, or wing the missile dart; The bounteous Gods afford a copious prey, And nine fat goats each vessel bears away: The royal bark had ten. Our ships compleat We thus supply'd, (for twelve were all the fleet.) Here, till the setting sun rowl'd down the light, We sate indulging in the genial rite: Nor wines were wanting; those from ample jars We drain'd, the prize of our Ciconian wars. The land of Cyclops lay in prospect near; The voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear, And from their mountains rising smokes appear. Now sunk the sun, and darkness cover'd o'er The face of things: along the sea-beat shore Satiate we slept: But when the sacred dawn Arising glitter'd o'er the dewy lawn, I call'd my fellows, and these words addrest. My dear associates, here indulge your rest: While, with my single ship, adventurous I The Reader may be pleas'd to observe, that the Poet has here given the reins to his fancy, and run out into a luxuriant description of Ægusa and Sicily: he refreshes the mind of the Reader with a pleasing and beautiful scene, before he enters upon a story of so much horror, as this of the Cyclops. A very sufficient reason may be assign'd, why Ulysses here goes in person to search this land: He dares not, as Eustathius remarks, trust his companions; their disobedience among the Ciconians, and their unworthy conduct among the Lotophagi, have convinc'd him that no confidence is to be repos'd in them: This seems probable, and upon this probability Homer proceeds to bring about the punishment of Polypheme, which the wisdom of Ulysses effects, and it is an action of importance, and consequently ought to be perform'd by the Heroe of the Poem. Go forth, the manners of yon men to try; Whether a race unjust, of barb'rous might, Rude, and unconscious of a stranger's right; Or such who harbour pity in their breast, Revere the Gods, and succour the distrest? This said, I climb'd my vessel's lofty side; My train obey'd me and the ship unty'd. In order seated on their banks, they sweep Neptune's smooth face, and cleave the yielding deep. When to the nearest verge of land we drew, Fast by the sea a lonely cave we view, High, and with dark'ning lawrels cover'd o'er; Where sheep and goats lay slumb'ring round the shore. Near this, a fence of marble from the rock, Brown with o'er-arching pine, and spreading oak, A Giant-shepherd here his flock maintains Far from the rest, and solitary reigns, In shelter thick of horrid shade reclin'd; And gloomy mischiefs labour in his mind. A form enormous! far unlike the race Goropius Becanus, an Antwerpian, has wrote a large discourse to prove, that there never were any such men as Giants; contrary to the testimony both of prophane and sacred History: Thus Moses speaks of the Rephaims of Asteroth, the Zamzummims of Hane, the Enims of Moab, and Anakims of Hebron. See Deut. ii. ver. 20. “That also was call'd a land of Giants, it was a great people, and tall as the Zamzummims.” Thus Goliath must be allow'd to be a Giant, for he was six cubits and a span, that is, nine feet and a span in height; his coat of mail weigh'd five thousand shekels of brass, about one hundred and fifty pounds; (but I confess others understand the lesser Shekel) the head of his spear alone weigh'd six hundred shekels of iron, that is about eighteen or nineteen pounds. We find the like relations in prophane History: Plutarch in his life of Theseus says, that age was productive of men of prodigious stature, Giants. Thus Diodorus Siculus; Ægyptii scribunt, Isidis ætate, fuisse vasto corpore homines, quos Græci dixere Gigantes. Herodotus affirms that the body of Orestes was dug up, and appear'd to be seven cubits long; but Aulus Gellius believes this to be an error. Josephus writes, l. 18. cap. 6. that Vitellius sent a Jew named Eleazar, seven cubits in height, as a present from Artabanus King of the Parthians, to Tiberius Cæsar; this man was ten feet and a half high. Pliny, 7. 16. speaks of a man that was nine feet nine inches high; and in another place, 6. 30. Sybortas, gentem Æthiopum Nomadum, octona cubita longitudine excedere. Thus it is evident, that there have been men of very extraordinary stature in former ages. Tho' perhaps such instances were not frequent in any age or any nation. So that Homer only amplifies, not invents; and as there was really a people call'd Cyclopeans, so they might be men great stature, or Giants. It may seem strange that in all ancient stories the first planters of most nations are recorded to be Giants; I scarce can persuade my self but such accounts are generally fabulous; and hope to be pardon'd for a conjecture which may give a seeming reason how such stories came to prevail. The Greeks were a people of very great antiquity; they made many expeditions, as appears from Jason, &amp;c. and sent out frequent Colonies: Now the head of every Colony was call'd ????, and these adventurers being persons of great figure in story, were recorded as men of war, of might and renown, thro' the old world: It is therefore not impossible but the Hebrews might form their word Anac, from the Greek ????, and use it to denote persons of uncommon might and abilities. These they call'd Anac, and sons of Anac; and afterwards in a less proper sense used it to signify men of uncommon stature, or Giants. So that in this sense, all nations may be said to be originally peopled by a son of Anac, or a Giant. But this is submitted as a conjecture to the Reader's judgment. Of human birth, in stature, or in face; As some lone mountain's monstrous growth he stood, Crown'd with rough thickets, and a nodding wood. I left my vessel at the point of land, And close to guard it, gave our crew command: With only twelve, the boldest and the best, I seek th'adventure, and forsake the rest. Then took a goatskin fill'd with precious wine, Such digressions as these are very frequent in Homer, but I am far from thinking them always beauties: 'Tis true, they give variety to Poetry; but whether that be an equivalent for calling off the attention of the Reader from the more important action, and diverting it with small incidents, is what I much question. It is not indeed impossible but this Maron might have been the friend of Homer, and this praise of him will then be a monument of his grateful disposition; and in this view, a beauty. It must be confess'd that Homer makes use of this wine to a very good effect, viz. to bring about the destruction of Polypheme, and his own deliverance; and therefore it was necessary to set it off very particularly, but this might have been done in fewer lines. As it now stands it is a little Episode; our expectations are rais'd to learn the event of so uncommon an adventure, when all of a sudden Homer breaks the story, and gives us a History of Maron. But I distrust my judgment much rather than Homer's. The gift of Maron, of Evantheus' line, (The Priest of Phœbus at th'Ismarian shrine) In sacred shade his honour'd mansion stood Amidst Apollo's consecrated wood; Him, and his house, heav'n mov'd my mind to save, And costly presents in return he gave; Sev'n golden talents to perfection wrought, A silver bowl that held a copious draught, And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine, Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine! Which now some ages from his race conceal'd, The hoary Sire in gratitude reveal'd. Such was the wine: to quench whose fervent steam, Scarce twenty measures from the living stream There is no wine of so strong a body as to bear such a disproportionable quantity; but Homer amplifies the strength of it to prepare the Reader for its surprizing effects immediately upon Polypheme. To cool one cup suffic'd: the goblet crown'd Breath'd aromatic fragrancies around. Of this an ample vase we heav'd a-board, And brought another with provisions stor'd. My soul foreboded I should find the bow'r Of some fell monster, fierce with barb'rous pow'r, Some rustic wretch, who liv'd in heav'n's despight, This whole passage must be consider'd as told by a person long after the adventure was past, otherwise how should Ulysses know that this cave was the habitation of a savage monster before he had seen him? and when he tells us that himself and twelve companions went to search, what people were inhabitants of this Island? Eustathius and Dacier seem both to have overlook'd this observation; for in a following note she condemns Ulysses for not flying from the Island, as he was advis'd by his companions. But if, on the other hand, we suppose that Ulysses was under apprehensions from the savageness of the place, of finding a savage race of people, it will be natural enough that his mind should forebode as much; and it appears from other passages, that this sort of instinctive presage was a favourite opinion of Homer's. Contemning laws, and trampling on the right. The cave we found, but vacant all within, (His flock the Giant tended on the green) But round the grott we gaze, and all we view In order rang'd, our admiration drew: The bending shelves with loads of cheeses prest, The folded flocks each sep'rate from the rest, (The larger here, and there the lesser lambs, The new-fall'n young here bleating for their dams; The kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies:) The cavern ecchoes with responsive cries. Capacious chargers all around were lay'd, Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade. With fresh provision hence our fleet to store My friends advise me, and to quit the shore; Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away, Consult our safety, and put off to sea. Their wholsome counsel rashly I declin'd, Curious to view the man of monstrous kind, And try what social rites a savage lends: Dire rites alas! and fatal to my friends! Then first a fire we kindle, and prepare For his return with sacrifice and prayer. The loaden shelves afford us full repast; We sit expecting. Lo! he comes at last. Near half a forest on his back he bore, And cast the pond'rous burden at the door. It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then, And sought the deep recesses of the den. Now driv'n before him, thro' the arching rock, Came tumbling, heaps on heaps, th'unnumber'd flock: Big-udder'd ewes, and goats of female kind, (The males were penn'd in outward courts behind) Then, heav'd on high, a rock's enormous weight To the cave's mouth he roll'd, and clos'd the gate. (Scarce twenty four-wheel'd cars, compact and strong, The massy load cou'd bear, or roll along) He next betakes him to his evening cares, And sitting down, to milk his flocks prepares; Of half their udders eases first the dams, Then to the mother's teat submits the lambs. Half the white stream to hard'ning cheese he prest, And high in wicker baskets heap'd: the rest Reserv'd in bowls, supply'd his nightly feast. His labour done, he fir'd the pyle that gave A sudden blaze, and lighted all the cave: We stand discover'd by the rising fires; Askance the giant glares, and thus enquires. What are ye, guests? on what adventure, say, Thus far ye wander thro' the wat'ry way? Pyrates perhaps, who seek thro' seas unknown The lives of others, and expose your own? His voice like thunder thro' the cavern sounds: My bold companions thrilling fear confounds, Appall'd at sight of more than mortal man! At length, with heart recover'd, I began. From Troy's fam'd fields, sad wand'rers o'er the main, This speech is very well adapted to make an impression upon Polypheme. Ulysses applies to move either his fears or his compassion; he tells him he is an unfortunate person, and comes as a suppliant; and if this prevails nothing, he adds, he is a subject of the great Agamemnon, who had lately destroy'd a mighty kingdom: Which is spoken to make him afraid to offer violence to the subject of a King who had power to revenge any injuries offer'd his people. To intimidate him further, he concludes with the mention of the Gods, and in particular of Jupiter, as avengers of any breach of the laws of hospitality: These are arguments well chosen to move any person, but an inhuman Polypheme. Eustathius. Behold the relicks of the Grecian train! Thro' various seas by various perils tost, And forc'd by storms, unwilling, on your coast; Far from our destin'd course, and native land, Such was our fate, and such high Jove's command! Nor what we are befits us to disclaim, Atrides' friends, (in arms a mighty name) Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow; Victors of late, but humble suppliants now! Low at thy knee thy succour we implore; Respect us, human, and relieve us, poor. At least some hospitable gift bestow; 'Tis what the happy to th'unhappy owe: 'Tis what the Gods require: Those Gods revere, The poor and stranger are their constant care; To Jove their cause, and their revenge belongs, He wanders with them, and he feels their wrongs. Fools that ye are! (the Savage thus replies, His inward fury blazing at his eyes) Or strangers, distant far from our abodes, To bid me rev'rence or regard the Gods. Know then we Cyclops are, a race above Those air-bred people, and their goat-nurs'd Jove: And learn, our pow'r proceeds with thee and thine, Not as He wills, but as our selves incline. But answer, the good ship that brought ye o'er, Where lies she anchor'd? near, or off the shore? Thus he. His meditated fraud I find, (Vers'd in the turns of various humankind) And cautious, thus. Against a dreadful rock, Fast by your shore the gallant vessel broke, Scarce with these few I scap'd; of all my train, Whom angry Neptune whelm'd beneath the main; The scatter'd wreck the winds blew back again. He answer'd with his deed. His bloody hand Snatch'd two, unhappy! of my martial band; And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor: There is a great beauty in the versification in the original. ??? ?? ??? ??????, ???? ???????? ???? ???? ?????. ?? ?? ????????? ??????? ???, ???? ?? ?????. Dionysius Halicarn. takes notice of it, in his Dissertation upon placing words: When the companions of Ulysses, says that Author, are dash'd against the rock, to express the horror of the action, Homer dwells upon the most inharmonious harsh letters and syllables: he no where uses any softness, or any run of verses to please the ear. Scaliger injudiciously condemns this description; “Homer, says he, makes use of the most offensive and loathsome expressions, more fit for a butcher's shambles than the majesty of Heroic Poetry.” Macrobius, lib. 5. cap. 13. of his Saturnalia, commends these lines of Homer, and even prefers them before the same description in Virgil; his words are, Narrationem facti nudam Mare posuit, Homerus ????? miscuit, &amp; dolore narrandi invidiam crudelitatis æquavit. And indeed he must be a strange Critic that expects soft verses upon a horrible occasion, whereas the verses ought, if possible, to represent the thought they are intended to convey; and every person's ear will inform him that Homer has not in this passage executed this rule unsuccessfully. The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore. Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid feast, And fierce devours it like a mountain beast: He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains, Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains. We see the death from which we cannot move, And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove. His ample maw with human carnage fill'd, A milky deluge next the giant swill'd; Then stretch'd in length o'er half the cavern'd rock, Lay senseless, and supine, amidst the flock. To seize the time, and with a sudden wound To fix the slumb'ring monster to the ground, My soul impels me; and in act I stand To draw the sword; but wisdom held my hand. A deed so rash had finish'd all our fate, No mortal forces from the lofty gate Could roll the rock. In hopeless grief we lay, And sigh, expecting the return of day. Now did the rosy-finger'd morn arise, And shed her sacred light along the skies. He wakes, he lights the fire, he milks the dams, And to the mother's teat submits the lambs. The task thus finish'd of his morning hours, Two more he snatches, murders, and devours. Then pleas'd and whistling, drives his flock before; Removes the rocky mountain from the door, And shuts again; with equal ease dispos'd, As a light quiver's lid is op'd and clos'd. His giant voice the ecchoing region fills: His flocks, obedient, spread o'er all the hills. Thus left behind, ev'n in the last despair I thought, devis'd, and Pallas heard my prayer. Revenge, and doubt, and caution, work'd my breast; But this of many counsels seem'd the best: The monster's club within the cave I spy'd, A tree of stateliest growth, and yet undry'd, Green from the wood; of height and bulk so vast, The largest ship might claim it for a mast. This shorten'd of its top, I gave my train A fathom's length, to shape it and to plain; The narrow'r end I sharpen'd to a spire; Whose point we harden'd with the force of fire, And hid it in the dust that strow'd the cave. Then to my few companions, bold and brave, Propos'd, who first the vent'rous deed should try? In the broad orbit of his monstrous eye To plunge the brand, and twirl the pointed wood; When slumber next should tame the man of blood. Just as I wish'd, the lots were cast on four; Ulysses bids his friends to cast lots; this is done to shew that he would not voluntarily expose them to so imminent danger. If he had made the choice himself, they whom he had chosen might have thought he had given them up to destruction, and they whom he had rejected might have judg'd it a stain upon them as a want of merit, and so have complain'd of injustice; but by this method he avoids these inconveniencies. My self the fifth. We stand, and wait the hour. He comes with evening: all his fleecy flock Before him march, and pour into the rock: Not one, or male or female, stay'd behind; (So fortune chanc'd, or so some God design'd) Ulysses ascribes it to the influence of the Gods, that Polypheme drives the whole flock into his den, and does not separate the females from the males as he had before done; for by this accident Ulysses makes his escape, as appears from the following part of the story. Homer here uses the ??????????, to shew the suspicion which Polypheme might entertain that Ulysses had other companions abroad who might plunder his flocks; and this gives another reason why he drove them all into his cave, namely for the greater security. Then heaving high the stone's unwieldy weight, He roll'd it on the cave, and clos'd the gate. First down he sits, to milk the woolly dams, And then permits their udder to the lambs. Next seiz'd two wretches more, and headlong cast, Brain'd on the rock; his second dire repast. I then approach'd him reeking with their gore, And held the brimming goblet foaming o'er: Cyclop! since human flesh has been thy feast, Now drain this goblet, potent to digest: Know hence what treasures in our ship we lost, And what rich liquors other climates boast. We to thy shore the precious freight shall bear, If home thou send us, and vouchsafe to spare. But oh! thus furious, thirsting thus for gore, The sons of men shall ne'er approach thy shore, And never shalt thou taste this Nectar more. He heard, he took, and pouring down his throat Delighted swill'd the large luxurious draught. More! give me more, he cry'd: the boon be thine, Whoe'er thou art that bear'st celestial wine! Declare thy name; not mortal is this juice, Such as th'unblest Cyclopean climes produce, (Tho' sure our vine the largest cluster yields, And Jove's scorn'd thunder serves to drench our fields) But this descended from the best abodes, A rill of Nectar, streaming from the Gods. He said, and greedy grasp'd the heady bowl, Thrice drain'd, and pour'd the deluge on his soul. His sense lay cover'd with the dozy fume; While thus my fraudful speech I reassume, Thy promis'd boon, O Cyclop! now I claim, And plead my title: Noman is my name. I will not trouble the Reader with a long account of ????? to be found in Eustathius, who seems delighted with this piece of pleasantry; nor with what Dacier observes, who declares she approves of it extremely, and calls it a very happy imagination. If it were modesty in me to dissent from Homer, and two Commentators, I would own my opinion of it, and acknowledge the whole to be nothing but a collusion of words, and fitter to have place in a Farce or Comedy, than in Epic Poetry. Lucian has thus used it, and apply'd it to raise laughter in one of his facetious dialogues. The whole wit or jest lies in the ambiguity of ?????, which Ulysses imposes upon Polypheme as his own name, which in reality signifies No Man. I doubt not but Homer was well pleased with it, for afterwards he plays upon the word, and calls Ulysses ????????? ?????. But the faults of Homer have a kind of veneration, perhaps, like old age, from their antiquity. Euripides has translated this whole passage in his Tragedy, call'd the Cyclops. The Chorus begins thus, Why dost thou thus cry out, Cyclops? Cyc. I am undone. Cho. You seem to be in a woful condition. Cyc. I am utterly miserable. Cho. You have been drunk and fall'n into the embers. Cyc. Noman has undone me. Cho. Well then No man has injur'd you. Cyc. Noman has blinded me. Cho. Then you are not blind. This appears to me more fit for the two Sosia's in Plautus, than for Tragic or Epic Poetry; and I fancy an Author who should introduce such a sport of words upon the stage, even in the Comedy of our days, would meet with small applause. By that distinguish'd from my tender years, 'Tis what my parents call me, and my peers. The Giant then. Our promis'd grace receive, The hospitable boon we mean to give: When all thy wretched crew have felt my pow'r, Noman shall be the last I will devour. He said; then nodding with the fumes of wine Dropt his huge head, and snoring lay supine. His neck obliquely o'er his shoulder hung, Prest with the weight of sleep that tames the strong! There belcht the mingled steams of wine and blood, And human flesh, his indigested food. Sudden I stir the embers, and inspire With animating breath the seeds of fire; Each drooping spirit with bold words repair, And urge my train the dreadful deed to dare. The stake now glow'd beneath the burning bed (Green as it was) and sparkled fiery red. Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring; With beating hearts my fellows form a ring. Urg'd by some present God, they swift let fall The pointed torment on his visual ball. My self above them from a rising ground Guide the sharp stake, and twirl it round and round, As when a shipwright stands his workmen o'er, Who plye the wimble, some huge beam to bore; This and the following comparison are drawn from low life, but ennobled with a dignity of expression. Instead of ???????, Aristarchus reads ???????, as Eustathius informs us. The similitudes are natural and lively, we are made spectators of what they represent. Sophocles has imitated this, in the Tragedy where O Edipus tears out his own eyes; and Euripides has transferr'd this whole adventure into his Cyclops with very little alteration, and in particular the former comparison. But to instance in all that Euripides has imitated, would be to transcribe a great part of that Tragedy. In short, this Episode in general is very noble; but if the Interlude about Outis be at all allowable in so grave and majestic a Poem, it is only allowable because it is here related before a light and injudicious assembly, I mean the Phæacians, to whom any thing more great or serious would have been less pleasing; so that the Poet writes to his audience. I wonder this has never been offer'd in defence of this low entertainment. Urg'd on all hands it nimbly spins about, The grain deep-piercing till it scoops it out: In his broad eye so whirls the fiery wood; From the pierc'd pupil spouts the boiling blood; Sing'd are his brows; the scorching lids grow black; The gelly bubbles, and the fibres crack. And as when Arm'rers temper in the ford The keen-edg'd pole-axe, or the shining sword, The red-hot metal hisses in the lake, Thus in his eyeball hiss'd the plunging stake. He sends a dreadful groan: the rocks around Thro' all their inmost-winding caves resound. Scar'd we receded. Forth, with frantic hand He tore, and dash'd on earth the goary brand: Then calls the Cyclops, all that round him dwell, With voice like thunder, and a direful yell. From all their dens the one-ey'd race repair, From rifted rocks, and mountains bleak in air. All haste assembled, at his well-known roar, Enquire the cause, and croud the cavern door. What hurts thee, Polypheme? what strange affright Thus breaks our slumbers, and disturbs the night? Does any mortal in th'unguarded hour Of sleep, oppress thee, or by fraud or pow'r? Or thieves insidious thy fair flock surprize? Thus they: the Cyclop from his den replies. Friends, Noman kills me; Noman in the hour Of sleep, oppresses me with fraudful pow'r. “If no man hurt thee, but the hand divine “Inflict disease, it fits thee to resign: “To Jove or to thy father Neptune pray. The brethren cry'd, and instant strode away. Joy touch'd my secret soul, and conscious heart, Pleas'd with th'effect of conduct and of art. Mean-time the Cyclop, raging with his wound, Spreads his wide arms, and searches round and round: At last, the stone removing from the gate, This conduct of Polypheme may seem very absurd, and it looks to be improbable that he should not call the other Giants to assist him, in the detection of the persons who had taken his sight from him; especially when it was now day-light, and they at hand. Eustathius was aware of the objection, and imputes it to his folly and dullness. Tully, 5. Tuscul. gives the same character of Polypheme; and because it vindicates Homer for introducing a speech of Polypheme to his Ram, I will beg leave to transcribe it. Tiresiam, quem sapientem fingunt poetæ, nunquam inducunt deplorantem Cæcitatem suam; at verò Polyphemum Homerus, cùm immanem ferumque finxisset, cum ariete etiam colloquentem facit ejusque laudare fortunas, quod quà vellet, ingredi posset, &amp; quæ vellet attingere: Rectè hic equidem; nihilo enim erat ipse Cyclops quam aries ille prudentior. This is a full defence of Homer; but Tully has mistaken the words of Polypheme to the Ram, for there is no resemblance to ejus laudare fortunas, quod quà velles ingredi posset, &amp;c. I suppose Tully quoted by memory. With hands extended in the midst he sate; And search'd each passing sheep, and felt it o'er, Secure to seize us ere we reach'd the door. (Such as his shallow wit, he deem'd was mine) But secret I revolv'd the deep design: 'Twas for our lives my lab'ring bosom wrought; Each scheme I turn'd, and sharpen'd every thought; This way and that, I cast to save my friends, 'Till one resolve my varying counsel ends. Strong were the Rams, with native purple fair, Well fed, and largest of the fleecy care. These three and three, with osier bands we ty'd, (The twining bands the Cyclop's bed supply'd) The midmost bore a man; the outward two Secur'd each side: So bound we all the crew. One ram remain'd, the leader of the flock; This passage has been misunderstood, to imply that Ulysses took more care of himself than of his companions, in chusing the largest ram for his own convenience; an imputation unworthy of the character of an Heroe. But there is no ground for it, he takes more care of his friends than of his own person, for he allots them three sheep, and lets them escape before him. Besides, this conduct was necessary; for all his friends were bound, and, by chusing this ram, he keeps himself at liberty to unbind the rest after their escape. Neither was there any other method practicable; for, he being the last, there was no person to bind him. Eustathius. The care Ulysses takes of his companions agrees with the character of Horace. Dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa Pertulit ? But it may seem improbable that a Ram should be able to carry so great a burthen as Ulysses; the generation of sheep, as well as men, may appear to have decreas'd since the days of Ulysses. Homer himself seems to have guarded against this objection, he describes these sheep as ?????????, ?????, ???????; the Ram is spoken of as ????? ?????, (an expression apply'd to Ajax, as Eustathius observes, in the Iliad.) History informs us of sheep of a very large size in other countries, and a Poet is at liberty to chuse the largest, if by that method he gives his story a greater appearance of probability. In his deep fleece my grasping hands I lock, And fast beneath, in woolly curls inwove, There cling implicite, and confide in Jove. When rosy morning glimmer'd o'er the dales, He drove to pasture all the lusty males: The ewes still folded, with distended thighs This particularity may seem of no importance, and consequently unnecessary: but it is in Poetry as in Painting; they both with very good effect use circumstances that are not absolutely necessary to the subject, but only appendages and embellishments. This particular has that effect, it represents Nature, and therefore gives an air of truth and probability to the story. Dacier. Unmilk'd, lay bleating in distressful cries. But heedless of those cares, with anguish stung, He felt their fleeces as they pass'd along, (Fool that he was) and let them safely go, All unsuspecting of their freight below. The master Ram at last approach'd the gate, Charg'd with his wool, and with Ulysses' fate. Him while he past the monster blind bespoke: What makes my ram the lag of all the flock? First thou wert wont to crop the flow'ry mead, First to the field and river's bank to lead, And first with stately step at evening hour Thy fleecy fellows usher to their bow'r. Now far the last, with pensive pace and slow Thou mov'st, as conscious of thy master's woe! Seest thou these lids that now unfold in vain? (The deed of Noman and his wicked train) Oh! didst thou feel for thy afflicted Lord, And wou'd but Fate the pow'r of speech afford; Soon might'st thou tell me, where in secret here The dastard lurks, all trembling with his fear: Swung round and round, and dash'd from rock to rock, His batter'd brains shou'd on the pavement smoke. No ease, no pleasure my sad heart receives, While such a monster as vile Noman lives. The Giant spoke, and thro' the hollow rock Dismiss'd the Ram, the father of the flock. No sooner freed, and thro' th'enclosure past, First I release my self, my fellows last: Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before, And reach our vessel on the winding shore. With joy the sailors view their friends return'd, And hail us living whom as dead they mourn'd. Big tears of transport stand in ev'ry eye: I check their fondness, and command to fly. Aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep, And snatch their oars, and rush into the deep. Now off at sea, and from the shallows clear, As far as human voice cou'd reach the ear; With taunts the distant giant I accost, Hear me, oh Cyclop! hear ungracious host! 'Twas on no coward, no ignoble slave, Thou meditat'st thy meal in yonder cave; But one, the vengeance fated from above Doom'd to inflict; the instrument of Jove. Thy barb'rous breach of hospitable bands, The God, the God revenges by my hands. These words the Cyclops' burning rage provoke: From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock; High o'er the billows flew the massy load, And near the ship came thund'ring on the flood. It almost brush'd the helm, and fell before: The Ancients, remarks Euthathius, placed an Obelisk and Asterism before this verse; the former, to note that they thought it misplaced; the latter, to shew that they look'd upon it as a beauty. Apparently it is not agreeable to the description; for how is it possible that this huge rock falling before the vessel should endanger the rudder, which is in the stern? Can a ship sail with the stern foremost? Some ancient Criticks, to take away the contradiction, have asserted that Ulysses turn'd his ship to speak to Polypheme; but this is absurd, for why could not Ulysses speak from the stern as well as from the prow? It therefore seems that the verse ought to be entirely omitted, as undoubtedly it may without any chasm in the Author. We find it inserted a little lower, and there it corresponds with the description, and stands with propriety. But if we suppose that the ship of Ulysses lay at such a distance from the cave of Polypheme, as to make it necessary to bring it nearer, to be heard distinctly; then indeed we may solve the difficulty, and let the verse stand: for if we suppose Ulysses approaching toward Polyheme, then the rock may be said to be thrown before the vessel, that is, beyond it, and endanger the rudder, and this bears some appearance of probability. This passage brings to my memory a description of Polypheme in Apollonius, Argonaut. 1. ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ??????? ????????, ???? ????? ?????? ????? ???? ???? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ??????. If Polypheme had really this quality of running upon the waves, he might have destroy'd Ulysses without throwing this mountain; but Apollonius is undoubtedly guilty of an absurdity, and one might rather believe that he would sink the earth at every step, than run upon the waters with such lightness as not to wet his feet. Virgil has more judiciously apply'd those lines to Camilla in his Æneis. ? Mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti Ferret iter, celeres nec tingeret æquore plantas. The Poet expresses the swiftness of Camilla in the nimble flow of the verse, which consists almost entirely of dactyles, and runs off with the utmost rapidity, like the last of those quoted from Apollonius. The whole sea shook, and refluent beat the shore. The strong concussion on the heaving tyde Roll'd back the vessel to the Island's side: Again I shov'd her off; our fate to fly, Each nerve we stretch, and ev'ry oar we ply. Just 'scap'd impending death, when now again We twice as far had furrow'd back the main, Once more I raise my voice; my friends afraid With mild entreaties my design dissuade. What boots the god-less Giant to provoke? Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke. Already, when the dreadful rock he threw, Old Ocean shook, and back his surges flew. Thy sounding voice directs his aim again; The rock o'erwhelms us, and we 'scap'd in vain. But I, of mind elate, and scorning fear, Thus with new taunts insult the monster's ear. Cyclop! if any, pitying thy disgrace, Ask who disfigur'd thus that eye-less face? Say 'twas Ulysses; 'twas his deed, declare, Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair; Ulysses, far in fighting fields renown'd, Before whose arm Troy tumbled to the ground. Th'astonisht Savage with a roar replies: Oh heav'ns! oh faith of ancient prophecies! This, Telemus Eurymedes foretold, This incident sufficiently shews the use of that dissimulation which enters into the character of Ulysses: If he had discover'd his name, the Cyclops had destroy'd him as his most dangerous enemy. Plutarch in his discourse upon Garrulity, commends the fidelity of the companions of Ulysses, who when they were dragg'd by this Giant and dash'd against the rock, confess'd not a word concerning their Lord, and scorn'd to purchase their lives at the expence of their honesty. Ulysses himself, adds he, was the most eloquent and most silent of men; he knew that a word spoken never wrought so much good, as a word conceal'd; Men teach us to speak, but the Gods teach us silence; for silence is the first thing that is taught us at our initiation into sacred mysteries; and we find these companions had profited under so great a Master in silence as Ulysses. Ovid relates this prophecy in the story of Polypheme and Galatea. Telemus interea Siculum delatus in æquor, Telemus Eurymides, quem nulla fefellerat ales, Terribilem Polyphemon adit; lumenque quod unum Fronte geris mediâ, rapiet tibi, dixit, Ulysses: Risit, &amp;, o vatum stolidissime, falleris, inquit, Altera jam rapuit: ? (The mighty Seer who on these hills grew old; Skill'd the dark fates of mortals to declare, And learn'd in all wing'd omens of the air) Long since he menac'd, such was Fate's command; And nam'd Ulysses as the destin'd hand. I deem'd some godlike Giant to behold, Or lofty Heroe, haughty, brave, and bold; Not this weak pigmy-wretch, of mean design, This is spoken in compliance with the character of a Giant; the Phæacians wonder'd at the manly stature of Ulysses, Polypheme speaks of him as a dwarf; his rage undoubtedly made him treat him with so much contempt. Nothing in nature can be better imagin'd than this story of the Cyclops, if we consider the assembly before which it was spoken, I mean the Phæacians, who had been driven from their habitation by the Cyclopeans, as appears from the sixth of the Odyssey, and compell'd to make a new settlement in their present country: Ulysses gratifies them by shewing what revenge he took upon one of their ancient enemies, and they could not decently refuse assistance to a person, who had punish'd those who had insulted their forefathers. Who not by strength subdu'd me, but by wine. But come, accept our gifts, and join to pray Great Neptune's blessing on the wat'ry way: For his I am, and I the lineage own; Th'immortal father no less boasts the son. His pow'r can heal me, and re-light my eye; And only his, of all the Gods on high. O! could this arm (I thus aloud rejoin'd) From that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind, And send thee howling to the realms of night! As sure, as Neptune cannot give thee sight. Thus I: while raging he repeats his cries, With hands uplifted to the starry skies. Hear me, oh Neptune! thou whose arms are hurl'd This is a master-piece of art in Ulysses; he shews Neptune to be his enemy, which might deter the Phæacians from assisting in his transportation, yet brings this very circumstance as an argument to induce them to it. O Neptune, says the Cyclop, destroy Ulysses, or if he be fated to return, may it be in a vessel not of his own! Here he plainly tells the Phæacians that the prayer of Cyclops was almost accomplish'd, for his own ships were destroy'd by Neptune, and now he was ready to sail in a foreign vessel; by which the whole prayer would be compleated. By this he persuades them, that they were the people ordain'd by the Fates to land him in his own country. From shore to shore, and gird the solid world. If thine I am, nor thou my birth disown, And if th'unhappy Cyclop be thy Son; Let not Ulysses breathe his native air, Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair. If to review his country be his fate, Be it thro' toils and suff'rings, long and late; His lost companions let him first deplore; Some vessel, not his own, transport him o'er; And when at home from foreign suff'rings freed, More near and deep, domestick woes succeed! With Imprecations thus he fill'd the air, And angry Neptune heard th'unrighteous pray'r. A larger rock then heaving from the plain, He whirl'd it round; it sung across the main: It fell, and brush'd the stern: The billows roar, Shake at the weight, and refluent beat the shore. With all our force we kept aloof to sea, And gain'd the Island where our vessels lay. Our sight the whole collected navy chear'd, Who, waiting long, by turns had hop'd and fear'd. There disembarking on the green sea-side, We land our cattle, and the spoil divide: Of these due shares to ev'ry sailor fall; The master Ram was voted mine by all: This perhaps might be a present of honour and distinction: But I should rather take it with Eustathius to be the Ram which brought Ulysses out of the den of Polypheme. That Heroe immediately offers it in sacrifice to Jupiter, in gratitude for his deliverance; an instance of piety to be imitated in more enlighten'd ages. The book concludes with a testimony of this Heroe's humanity; in the midst of the joy for his own safety, his generous heart finds room for a tender sentiment for the loss of his companions; both his joys and his sorrows are commendable and virtuous. Virgil has borrow'd this Episode of Polyphemus, and inserted it into the third of the Æneis. I will not presume to decide which Author has the greatest success, they both have their peculiar excellencies. Rapine confesses this Episode to be equal to any parts of the Iliad, that it is an original, and that Homer introduced that monstrous character to shew the Marvelous, and paint it in a new set of colours. Demetrius Phalereus calls it a piece of Sublime strangely horrible; and Longinus, even while he is condemning the Odyssey, allows this adventure of Polypheme to be very great and beautiful; (for so Monsieur Boileau understands Longinus, tho' Monsieur Dacier differs from his judgment.) In Homer we find a greater variety of natural incidents than in Virgil, but in Virgil a greater pomp of verse. Homer is not uniform in his description, but sometimes stoops perhaps below the dignity of Epic Poetry; Virgil walks along with an even, grave, and majestic pace: They both raise our admiration, mix'd with delight and terror. And him (the guardian of Ulysses' fate) With pious mind to Heav'n I consecrate. But the great God, whose thunder rends the skies, Averse, beholds the smoaking sacrifice; And see me wand'ring still from coast to coast; And all my vessels, all my people, lost! While thoughtless we, indulge the genial rite, As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite; 'Till evening Phœbus roll'd away the light: Stretch'd on the shore in careless ease we rest, 'Till ruddy morning purpled o'er the east. Then from their anchors all our ships unbind, And mount the decks, and call the willing wind. Now rang'd in order on our banks, we sweep With hasty strokes the hoarse-resounding deep; Blind to the future, pensive with our fears, Glad for the living, for the dead in tears. The End of the Second Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. THE TENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. Adventures with Æolus, the Lestrigons, and Circe. Ulysses arrives at the Island of Æolus, who gives him prosperous winds, and incloses the adverse ones in a Bag, which his companions untying, they are driven back again, and rejected. Then they sail to the Lestrigons, where they lose eleven ships, and with one only remaining, proceed to the Island of Circe. Eurylochus is sent first with some Companions, all which, except Eurylochus, are transform'd into Swine. Ulysses then undertakes the adventure, and by the help of Mercury, who gives him the herb Moly, overcomes the Enchantress, and procures the restoration of his men. After a years stay with her, he prepares at her instigation for his voyage to the infernal shades. Poetry is a mixture of History and Fable; the foundation is historical, because the Poet does not entirely neglect truth; the rest is fabulous, because naked truth would not be sufficiently surprizing; for the Marvellous ought to take place, especially in Epic Poetry. But it may be ask'd, does not Homer offend against all degrees of probability in these Episodes of the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, Cyclops and Antiphates? How are these incredible stories to be reduc'd into the bounds of probability? 'tis true, the Marvellous ought to be used in Epic Poetry; but ought it to transgress all power of belief? Aristotle in his Art of Poetry lays down a rule to justify these incidents: A Poet, says that Author, ought to prefer things impossible, provided they are probable, before things possible, that are nevertheless incredible. Chap. 15. This rule is not without obscurity; but Monsieur Dacier has explain'd it in his Annotations upon that Author: A thing may be impossible, and yet probable: Thus when the Poet introduces a Deity, any incident humanly impossible receives a full probability by being ascribed to the skill and power of a God: 'Tis thus we justifie the story of the transformation of the ship of the Phæacians into a rock, and the fleet of Æneas into Sea-nymphs. But such relations ought not to be too frequent in a Poem; for it is an established rule, that all incidents which require a divine probability only, should be so disengaged from the action, that they may be substracted from it, without destroying it; for instance, if we omit the transformation of the ship, the action of the Odyssey will retain the same perfection. And therefore those Episodes which are necessary, and make essential parts of the Poem, ought to be grounded upon human probability; now the Episodes of Circe, Polypheme, the Sirens, &amp;c. are necessary to the action of the Odyssey: But will any man say they are within the bounds of human probability? How then shall we solve this difficulty? Homer artificially has brought them within the degrees of it; he makes Ulysses relate them before a credulous and ignorant assembly; he lets us into the character of the Phæacians, by saying they were a very dull nation, in the sixth book, When never Science rear'd her laurel'd head. It is thus the Poet gives probability to his fables, by reciting them to a people who believed them, and who through a laziness of life were fond of romantic stories; he adapts himself to his audience, and yet even here he is not unmindful of his more intelligent Readers; he gives them (observes Bossu) in these fables all the pleasure that can be reap'd from physical or moral truths, disguis'd under miraculous Allegories, and by this method reconciles them to poetical probability. There are several heads to which Probability may be reduced; either to Divinity, and then nothing is improbable, for every thing is possible to a Deity; or to our Ideas of things whether true or false: thus in the descent of Ulysses into Hell, there is not one word of probability or historic truth, but if we examine it by the ideas that the old world entertain'd of Hell, it becomes probable; or lastly, we may have respect to vulgar opinion or fame; for a Poet is at liberty to relate a falshood, provided it be commonly believed to be true. We might have recourse to this last rule, which is likewise laid down by Aristotle, to vindicate the Odyssey, if there were occasion for it; for in all ages such fables have found belief. I will only add, that Virgil has given a sanction to these stories, by inserting them in his Æneis; and Horace calls them by the remarkable epithet of specious miracles. —Ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat, Antiphaten, Scyllamque &amp; cum Cyclope Charybdin. Longinus calls these fables Dreams, but adds, that they are the dreams of Jupiter; he likewise blames these Episodes, because in all of them there is much more fable and narration than action: Which criticism may perhaps be too severe, if we consider that past adventures are here brought into present use, and though they be not actions, yet they are the representations of actions, agreeable to the nature of Episodes. It may be question'd if Virgil is so happy in the choice of the audience, to which he relates many of these fables; the Carthaginians were not ignorant, like the Phæacians: From whence then do his stories receive their Probability? It is not so easy to answer this objection, unless we have recourse to common fame: Virgil was not the Author of them, Homer had establish'd them, and brought them into fame, so that Virgil had common opinion to vindicate him, join'd with Homer's authority. At length we reach'd Æolia's sea-girt shore, It is difficult to distinguish what is truth from what is fiction in this relation: Diodorus, who was a Sicilian, speaks of Æolus, and refers to this passage: “This is that Æolus, says he, who entertain'd Ulysses in his voyages: He is reported to have been a pious and just Prince, and given to hospitality, and therefore ????? ?????????, as Homer expresses it.” But whence has the fable of his being the Governor of the Winds taken its foundation? Eustathius tells us, that he was a very wise man, and one who from long observation could foretell what weather was like to follow: others say he was an Astronomer, and studied chiefly the nature of the Winds; and as Atlas from his knowledge in Astrology was said to sustain the heavens; so Æolus, from his experience and observation, was fabled to be the ruler or disposer of the Winds. But what explication can be given of this bag, in which he is said to bind the Winds? Eratosthenes, continues Eustathius, said pleasantly, that we shall then find the places where Ulysses voyag'd, when we have discover'd the artist, or cobler, ??? ??????, who sew'd up this bag of the winds. But the reason of the fiction is supposed to be this: Æolus taught the use and management of sails, and having foretold Ulysses from what quarter the winds would blow, he may be said to have gather'd them into a kind of enclosure, and retain'd them as use should require. Diodorus explains it a little differently, lib. 5. ???? ?? ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ????????? ??????????????, ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ??????????? ??????????????, ????????? ???? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ?? ?????? ?????? ????? ????????; that is, “He taught the use of sails, and having learn'd from observing the bearing of the smoke and fires (of those Vulcanian Islands) what winds would blow, he usually foretold them with exactness, and from hence he is fabled to be the disposer of the Winds.” The words of Varro, quoted by Servius, are to the same purpose: Varro autem dicit hunc insularum regem fuisse, ex quarum nebulis &amp; fumo Vulcaniæ insulæ prædicens futura flabra ventorum, ab imperitis visus est ventos suâ potestate retinere. Polybius will not admit that this story of Æolus is entirely fable; and Strabo is of the same opinion, that Ulysses was in the Sicilian seas; and that there was such a King as Æolus, he affirms to be truth, but that he met with such adventures is, in the main, fiction. There may another reason, as Eustathius observes, be given for the fiction of binding up the winds in a bag: they who practis'd the Art of Incantation or charms, made use of the skin of a Dolphin, and pretended by certain ceremonies to bind or loose the winds as they pleased; and this practice is a sufficient ground to build upon in Poetry. The solution also of Bochart is worth our notice: Homer borrowed the word ?????? from the Phæacian Aol, which signifies a whirlwind or tempest, from whence the Greeks form'd their word ?????; the Phæacians observing the King of this Island to be very expert in foretelling the winds, called him King Aolin, or King of the winds and storms; from hence Homer form'd a proper name and call'd him ??????. It must be confess'd, that this solution is ingenious, and not without an appearance of probability. But having laid together what may be said in vindication of this story of Æolus: Justice requires that I should not suppress what has been objected against it by no less a Critic than Longinus: he observes that a genius naturally lofty sometimes falls into trifling; an instance of this, adds he, is what Homer says of the bag wherein Æolus inclosed the winds. Cap. 7. ???? ?????. Where great Hippotades the scepter bore, A floating Isle! High-rais'd by toil divine, The word in the orginal is ?????: some take it, as Eustathius remarks, for a proper name; but Aristarchus believes Homer intended to express by it a floating Island, that was frequently removed by concussions and earthquakes, for it is seen sometimes on the right, at other times on the left hand; the like has been said of Delos; and Herodotus thus describes the Island Echemis in the Ægyptian seas. Dionysius, in his ??????????, affirms, that this Island is not called by the name of ?????, by reason of its floating, but because it is an Island of fame, and much sail'd unto, or ????? by navigators; that is, ????????, or ?? ?????? ?????????? ???????, or lying in seas of great navigation: but perhaps the former opinion of Aristarchus may be preferable, as it best contributes to raise the wonder and admiration of the credulous ignorant Phæacians, which was the sole intention of Ulysses. These Islands were seven in number, (but eleven at this day) Strongyle, Hiera, Didyme, Hicesia, Lipara, Ericodes, and Phænic?i?des, all lying in the Sicilian seas, as Diodorus Siculus testifies; but differs in the name of one of the Islands. Strabo is of opinion, that the Island call'd by Homer, the Æolian, is Strongyle; ? ?? ????????? ???? ????????, ?? ?????? ????????????, ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ????. “This Island Strongyle abounds with subterraneous fires, &amp;c. and here Æolus is said to have reign'd.” Pliny agrees with Strabo, lib. 3. but Dacier understands it to be Lipara, according to Virgil, Æn. lib. 8. but in reality the seven were all call'd the Æolian Islands. Insula Sicanium juxta latus, Æoliamque Erigitur Liparen, fumantibus ardua saxis, But why is it fabled to be surrounded with a wall of brass? Eustathius says, that this may proceed from its being almost inaccessible; but this reason is not sufficient to give foundation to such a fiction. Dacier observes that it is thus described, because of the subterranean fires, which from time to time break out from the entrails of this Island. Aristotle speaking of Lipara, which is the most considerable of the Æolian Islands, thus describes it; “All night long the Island Lipara appears enlighten'd with fires.” The same relation agrees with Strongyle, call'd Strombolo at this day. I will take the liberty to propose a conjecture, which may perhaps not unhappily give a reason of this fiction of the wall of brass, from this description of Aristotle: All night fires appear (says that Author) from this Island, and these fires falling upon the seas, might cast a ruddy reflexion round the Island, which to navigators might look like a wall of brass enclosing it. This is but a conjecture drawn from appearances; but to write according to appearances is allowable in Poetry, where a seeming or a real truth may be used indifferently. Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine. Six blooming youths, in private grandeur bred, Diodorus Siculus mentions the names of the six sons of Æolus, but is silent concerning his daughters, and therefore others, who can find mysteries in the plainest description, assure us, that this is not to be understood historically, but allegorically: Æolus represents the year, his twelve children are the twelve months, six of which are female, to denote those six months in which the earth brings forth her fruits; by his six sons the other months are understood, in which the seed is sown, or in which the herbs, fruits, &amp;c. are nourished in order to production, these may therefore be called males. But this is to darken an Author into mystery, not to explain him. Dacier gives us another allegorical interpretation: The Poet makes him the governor of the winds, and gives him twelve children, these denote the twelve principal winds; half of which children are males, half females; the males denote the winter winds, which as it were brood upon the earth, and generate its increase; the females those warmer seasons of the year, when the more prolific winds blow, and make the earth teem with fruitfulness: These children of Æolus are in continual feasts in his Palace; that is, the winds are continually fed by the exhalations from the earth, which may be call'd their food or nourishment: The brothers and sisters inter-marry; this denotes the nature of the winds, which blow promiscuously, and one wind unites it self with another from all quarters of the world indifferently: The brothers and sisters are said to sleep by night together; that is, the winds are usually still and calm, and as it were rest together, at that season. But what occasion is there to have recourse to an uncertain Allegory, when such great names as Polybius, Strabo, and Diodorus assure us, that this relation is in part true History; and if there was really such a King as Æolus, why might he not be a father of six sons and as many daughters? I should prefer a plain History to a dark Allegory. And six fair daughters, grac'd the royal bed: These sons their sisters wed, and all remain Their parent's pride, and pleasure of their reign. All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round, Homer was not unacquainted with the wonders related of this Island Lipara. “In this Island, says Aristotle, a monument is reported to be, of which they tell miracles: they assure us that they hear issuing from it the sound of timbrels or cymbals, plainly and distinctly.” It is easy to perceive that this is founded upon the noise the fires make which are enclosed in the caverns of this Island, and that Homer alludes to the ancient name of it, which in the Phœnician language (Meloginin, as Bochart observes) signifies the land of those who play upon instruments. We learn from Callimachus, in his Hymn to Diana, that Lipara was originally call'd Meligounis. She (Diana) went to find out the Cyclops: she found them in Lipara, for that is the name the Isle now bears, but anciently it was call'd Meligonnis; they were labouring a huge mass of red hot iron, &amp;c. So that Homer is not all invention, but adapts his Poetry to tradition and ancient story. Dacier. And joy and music thro' the Isle resound: At night each pair on splendid carpets lay, And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day. This happy port affords our wand'ring fleet A month's reception, and a safe retreat. Full oft the Monarch urg'd me to relate The fall of Ilion, and the Grecian fate; Full oft I told: At length for parting mov'd; The King with mighty gifts my suit approv'd. The adverse winds in leathern bags he brac'd, Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast: For him the mighty Sire of Gods assign'd The tempest's Lord, and tyrant of the wind; His word alone the list'ning storms obey, To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea. These in my hollow ship the Monarch hung, Securely fetter'd by a silver thong. But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales He charg'd to fill, and guide the swelling sails: Rare gift! but oh, what gift to fools avails! Nine prosp'rous days we ply'd the lab'ring oar; The tenth presents our welcome native shore: The hills display the beacon's friendly light, Eustathius observes that these fires were a kind of beacons kept continually burning to direct Navigators; the smoke gave notice by day, the light of the flame by night. Ithaca was environ'd with rocks, and consequently there was a necessity for this care, to guide sea-faring men to avoid those rocks, and to point out the places of landing with security. But is it not an imputation to the wisdom of Ulysses, to suffer himself to be surpriz'd with sleep, when he was almost ready to enter the ports of his own country? and is it not probable that the joy he must be suppos'd to receive at the sight of it, should not induce him to a few hours watchfulness? It is easier to defend his sleeping here, than in the 13th of the Odyssey: the Poet very judiciously tells us, that Ulysses for nine days together almost continually wak'd and took charge of the vessel, and the word ???????? shews that nature was wearied out, and that he fell into an involuntary repose; it can therefore be no diminution to his character to be forced to yield to the calls of nature, any more than it is to be hungry: His prudence and love of his country sufficiently appear from the care he took thro' the space of nine days to arrive at it; so that this circumstance must be imputed to the infirmity of human nature, and not to a defect of care or wisdom in Ulysses. And rising mountains gain upon our sight. Then first my eyes, by watchful toils opprest, Comply'd to take the balmy gifts of rest; Then first my hands did from the rudder part, (So much the love of home possess'd my heart) When lo! on board a fond debate arose; What rare device those vessels might enclose? What sum, what prize from Æolus I brought? Whilst to his neighbour each express'd his thought. Say whence, ye Gods, contending nations strive Who most shall please, who most our Hero give? Long have his coffers groan'd with Trojan spoils; Whilst we, the wretched part'ners of his toils, Reproach'd by want, our fruitless labours mourn, And only rich in barren fame return. Now Æolus, ye see, augments his store: But come, my friends, these mystic gifts explore. They said: and (oh curs'd Fate!) the thongs unbound; This relation has been blam'd as improbable; what occasion was there to unbind the bag, when these companions of Ulysses might have satisfy'd their curiosity that there was no treasure in it from the brightness of it? But Homer himself obviates this objection, by telling us that Æolus fasten'd it in the vessel, as Eustathius observes, ??? ?? ??? ??????? ??????? ? Bossu gives us the moral of this fable or allegory, cap. 10. lib. 1. By the winds inclosed in the bag, into which the companions of Ulysses were so unwise as to pry, is to be understood, that we ought not to intrude into those mysteries of government which the Prince intends to keep secret: The tempests and confusions rais'd by the loosing the winds, represent the mischiefs and disorders that arise from such a vain curiosity in the subject: A wise people permit the winds to rest without molestation, and satisfie themselves with those that the Prince is pleas'd to release, and believe them to be the most proper and useful. But whatever judgment is pass'd upon this explication, it is certainly an instance of the ill consequences of avarice, and unseasonable curiosity. The gushing tempest sweeps the Ocean round; Snatch'd in the whirl, the hurried navy flew, The Ocean widen'd, and the shores withdrew. Rowz'd from my fatal sleep, I long debate If still to live, or desp'rate plunge to Fate: We ought not to infer from this passage, that Homer thought a person might lawfully take away his own life to avoid the greatest dangers; what Ulysses here speaks arises from the violence of a sudden passion, and gives us a true picture of Human Nature: The wisest of men are not free from the infirmity of passion, but reason corrects and subdues it. This is the case in the instance before us; Ulysses has so much of the man in him as to be liable to the passion of man; but so much virtue and wisdom as to restrain and govern it. Thus doubting, prostrate on the deck I lay, 'Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way. Mean-while our vessels plough the liquid plain, And soon the known Æolian coast regain: Our groans the rocks re-murmur'd to the main. We leap'd on shore, and with a scanty feast Our thirst and hunger hastily repress'd; That done, two chosen heralds strait attend Our second progress to my royal friend; And him amidst his jovial sons we found, The banquet steaming, and the goblets crown'd: There humbly stopp'd with conscious shame and awe, Nor nearer than the gate presum'd to draw. But soon his sons their well-known guest descry'd, And starting from their couches loudly cry'd, Ulysses here! what Dæmon cou'dst thou meet To thwart thy passage, and repel thy fleet? Wast thou not furnish'd by our choicest care For Greece, for home, and all thy soul held dear? Thus they; in silence long my fate I mourn'd, At length these words with accent low return'd. Me, lock'd in sleep, my faithless crew bereft Of all the blessings of your god-like gift! But grant, oh grant our loss we may retrieve: A favour you, and you alone can give. Thus I with art to move their pity try'd, And touch'd the Youths; but their stern Sire reply'd, Vile wretch, begone! this instant I command This unhospitable character of Æolus may seem contrary to the human disposition which Homer before ascrib'd to him; he therefore tells us, that Ulysses appear'd to him to be an object of divine vengeance, and that to give him assistance would be to act against the will of the Gods. But, observes Eustathius, is not this an ill-chosen relation to be made to the Phæacians, as the Critics have remark'd, and might it not deter them from assisting a man whom Æolus had rejected as an enemy to the Gods? He answers, that it was evident to the Phæacians, that Ulysses was no longer under the displeasure of Heaven, that the imprecations of Polypheme were fulfilled; he being to be transported to his own country by strangers, according to his prayer in the ninth of the Odyssey, and consequently the Phæacians have nothing to fear from the assistance which they lend Ulysses. Thy fleet accurs'd to leave our hallow'd land. His baneful suit pollutes these bless'd abodes, Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the Gods. Thus fierce he said: we sighing went our way, And with desponding hearts put off to sea. The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn, But mourn in vain; no prospect of return. Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer, The next proud Lamos' stately tow'rs appear, And Læstrigonia's gates arise distinct in air. The shepherd quitting here at night the plain, This passage has been thought to be very difficult; but Eustathius makes it intelligible: The Land of the Læstrigons was fruitful, and fit for pasturage; it was the practice to tend the sheep by day, and the oxen by night; for it was infested by a kind of fly that was very grievous to the oxen by day, whereas the wool of the sheep defended them from it: and therefore the shepherds drove their oxen to pasture by night. If the same shepherd who watched the sheep by day, could pass the night without sleep, and attend the oxen, he perform'd a double duty, and consequently merited a double reward. Homer says, that the ways of the night and day were near to each other, that is, the pastures of the sheep and oxen, and the ways that led to them were adjacent; for the shepherd that drove his flocks home, (or ????????, as Homer expresses it,) could call to the herdsman, who drove his herds to pasture, or ???????, and be heard with ease, and therefore the roads must be adjoining. Crates gives us a very different interpretation: He asserts that Homer intended to express the situation of the Læstrigons, and affirms that they lay under the head of the Dragon, (??????? ?????????, which Dacier renders the tail of a Dragon) according to Aratus, ? ?????? (??????) ????? ????????? ??????, ??? ???????? ?????????. which Tully thus translates, Hoc caput hic paullum sese subitoque recondit Ortus ubi atque obitus partem admiscentur in unam. If this be true, the Poet intended to express that there was scarce any night at all among the Læstrigons, according to that of Manilius, Vixque ortus, occasus erit— But how will this agree with the situation of the Læstrigons, who were undoubtedly Sicilians, according to the direct affirmation of Thucydides, lib. 6. of his History? Besides, if Læstrigonia lay under the head of the Dragon, Ulysses must have spent seven months instead of seven days, in sailing from the Æolian Islands to that country. Neither is there any necessity to have recourse to this solution; for what signifies the length or shortness of the day to the double wages of the shepherds, when it was paid to him who took upon him a double charge of watching the whole day and night, which comprehends the space of four and twenty hours; which alone, whether the greater part of it was by night or day, entituled the shepherd to a double reward? I therefore should rather chuse the former interpretation, with which Didymus agrees. ??????????, ??? ???????? ????? ????? ???? ??? ??????; that is, “both the night pastures, and those of the day, are adjacent to the city. It is evident that the Læstrigons also inhabited Formiæ, a city of Campania near Cajeta: Thus Horace, lib. 3. Ode 17. Æli vetusto nobilis ab Lame? Auctore ab illo ducit originem Qui Formiarum mœnia dicitur Princeps? It was also call'd Hormiæ, according to Strabo, ???????, ????????? ??????, ?????? ????????? ??? ?? ???????; that is, “Formiæ was built by a Laconian, call'd also Hormiæ, from its being an excellent station for ships.” Tully had this place in view in his epistle to Atticus, lib. 2. Epist. 13. Si vero in hanc ?????????, veneris ?????????????, Formias dico. And Pliny to the same purpose, lib. 3. cap. 5. Oppidum Formiæ, Hormiæ ante dictum ut existimavêre, antiqua Læstrigonum sedes. But how will this agree with Homer, who places them in Sicily, and Tully and Pliny in Campania in Italy? Dacier answers, that they were originally Sicilians, as appears from Pliny, lib. 3. Cap. 8. Flumina, Symæthus, Terias, intus Læstrigonii campi, oppidum Leontini. And why might not these Læstrigons, or a Colony of them, leave Sicily to settle in Italy, as it is evident the Phæacians had done, and fix'd in Corcyra? Bochart's opinion concerning this nation is not to be neglected; the words Læstrigons and Leontines are of the same import; Læstrigon is a Phœnician name, Lais tircam, that is, a devouring Lion; this is render'd literally by the Latin word Leontinum, and both denote the savage and Leonine disposition of this people: the word Lamus is also of Phœnician extract: Laham, or Lahama, signifies a Devourer; from hence probably was deriv'd that Lamia, who devour'd young infants, mention'd by Horace in his Art of Poetry. Nec pransæ Lamiæ vivum puerum extrahat alvo. We are inform'd that there was a Queen of Libya of that name, by Diodorus Siculus; she was a person of great beauty, but of great barbarity. Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain; But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear, And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care, So near the pastures, and so short the way, His double toils may claim a double pay, And join the labours of the night and day. Within a long recess a bay there lies, Edg'd round with cliffs, high-pointing to the skies; The jutting shores that swell on either side Contract its mouth, and break the rushing tide. Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat, And bound within the port their crowded fleet: For here retir'd the sinking billows sleep, And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep. I only in the bay refus'd to moor, It may appear at the first view, that Ulysses took more care of himself than of his companions; and it may be ask'd, why did he not restrain them from entring the bay, when his caution plainly shews that he was apprehensive of danger? had he more fear than the rest of the company? No; but a greater foresight; a wise man provides as far as lies within his power against all contingencies, and the event shews, that his companions were rash, and he wise to act with so much circumspection; they staid not for command, and therefore were justly punished for acting precipitately without the direction of their General and King. And fix'd, without, my haulsers to the shore. From thence we climb'd a point, whose airy brow Commands the prospect of the plains below: No tracks of beasts, or signs of men we found, But smoaky volumes rolling from the ground. Two with our herald thither we command, With speed to learn what men possess'd the land. They went, and kept the wheel's smooth-beaten road Which to the city drew the mountain wood; When lo! they met, beside a crystal spring, The daughter of Antiphates the King; It is not evident from whence Ulysses had the knowledge of these particulars; the persons whom he sent to search the land perish'd in the attempt, or were destroy'd with the fleet by the Læstrigons: How then could this relation be made to Ulysses? It is probable that he had his information from Circe or Calypso, for Circe in the sequel of the Odyssey tells Ulysses, that she was acquainted with all the sufferings that he had undergone by sea; and if she, as a Goddess, knew his adventures, why might she not relate to him these particulars? Homer a little lower tells us, that the Læstrigons transfix'd (?????????) the companions of Ulysses, and then carried them away on their weapons like so many fishes; others prefer ???????, that is, connecting them together like a range of fishes; both which very well express the prodigious strength of these Giants: others chuse the word ???????????, or, “they eat them yet alive (palpitantes) like fishes.” The preference is submitted to the Reader. Eustathius. I will only add, that possibly the relation of the barbarity of Polypheme, and Antiphates, with respect to their eating the flesh of men, may not be entirely fabulous: Modern history assures us, that savages have been found in parts of the world lately discover'd, who eat the bodies of their enemies: It is therefore no wonder that the more polite and civiliz'd nations of Antiquity, look'd upon such men as monsters, and that their Poets painted them as such, or perhaps aggravated the fierte, or fierceness of their features, struck with horror at their brutal inhumanity. She to Artacia's silver streams came down, (Artacia's streams alone supply the town:) The damsel they approach, and ask'd what race The people were? who monarch of the place? With joy the Maid th'unwary strangers heard, And shew'd them where the royal dome appear'd. They went; but as they ent'ring saw the Queen Of size enormous, and terrific mien, (Not yielding to some bulky mountain's height) A sudden horror struck their aking sight. Swift at her call her husband scowr'd away To wreak his hunger on the destin'd prey; One for his food the raging glutton slew, But two rush'd out, and to the navy flew. Balk'd of his prey, the yelling monster flies, And fills the city with his hideous cries; A ghastly band of Giants hear the roar, And pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore. Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow, And dash the ruins on the ships below: The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise, And mingled horrors eccho to the skies. The men, like fish, they stuck upon the flood, And cram'd their filthy throats with human food. Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay, My sword our cables cut, I call'd to weigh; And charg'd my men, as they from fate would flie, Each nerve to strain, each bending oar to ply. The sailors catch the word, their oars they seize, And sweep with equal strokes the smoaky seas; Clear of the rocks th'impatient vessel flies; Whilst in the port each wretch encumber'd dies. With earnest haste my frighted sailors press, While kindling transports glow'd at our success; But the sad fate that did our friends destroy Cool'd ev'ry breast, and damp'd the rising joy, Now dropp'd our anchors in th'Ææan bay, Where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the Day; Hesiod in his Theogony agrees with Homer as to the Genealogy of Circe and Æetes. ????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???????, ?????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????. That is, “Perseis the daughter of Oceanus bore to Phæbus, Circe and King Æetes.” But why are they fabled to be the offspring of the sun? Eustathius answers, either from their high birth, as the great personages of Antiquity were call'd ?????????, or the sons of Jupiter, and the Sun in the ancient Mythology represented that Deity; or from their extraordinary beauty, which might be compar'd to the Sun, or from their illustrious actions. But perhaps the whole might be deriv'd from the way of speaking among the Orientals; at this day we are inform'd from the best Historians, that such language prevails in the eastern countries, and Kings and great personages are call'd the brothers or offspring of the Sun. This Ææa is a mountain or promontory in Italy: perhaps originally an Island, and still keeping the resemblance of it. Thus Procopius, Gothicorum, lib. 1. Circeium haud modico tractu in mare porrectum insulæ speciem fert, tam præternavigantibus quam terrestri itinere prætereuntibus: and Strabo, lib. 5. ???????? ???? ???????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????. But is the relation that Homer makes of this Island, and of Circe, agreeable to truth? Undoubtedly it is not; but Homer was very well acquainted with the story of Medea, and applies what was reported of that Enchantress to Circe, and gives the name of Ææa to the island of Circe, in resemblance to Æa, a city of Colchos, the country of Medea and Æetes. That Homer was not a stranger to the story of Medea is evident, for he mentions the ship Argo in the twelfth Odyssey, in which Jason sail'd to Colchos, where Medea fell in love with him; so that tho' Circe be a fabled Deity, yet what Homer says of her, was applicable to the character of another person, and consequently a just foundation for a story in Poetry. With this opinion Strabo agrees. Her Mother Persè, of old Ocean's strain, Thus from the Sun descended, and the Main. (From the same lineage stern Æætes came, The far-fam'd brother of th'enchantress dame) Goddess, and Queen, to whom the pow'rs belong Of dreadful Magic, and commanding Song. Some God directing, to this peaceful bay Silent we came, and melancholy lay, Spent and o'erwatch'd. Two days and nights roll'd on, And now the third succeeding morning shone. I climb'd a cliff, with spear and sword in hand, Scaliger, lib. 5. of his Poetics observes, that there is a general resemblance between Ulysses in Homer, and Æneas in Virgil, and that Æneas acts in the same manner as Ulysses. ? exire, locosque Explorare novos, quas vento accesserit oras, Qui teneant, (nam inculta videt) hominesne feræne Quærere constituit. That Critic remarks, that tho' the attitudes of the two Heroes are the same, yet they are drawn by Virgil with a more masterly hand: Fusior &amp; latior Homerus invenietur, pictior Virgilius &amp; numeris astrictior. Ulysses himself here takes a general view of the Island, but sends his companions for a more particular information; this was necessary to introduce the following story, and give it an air of probability; if he had made the experiment in his own person, his virtue would have been proof against the sorceries of Circe, and consequently there could not have been room for a description of her enchantments. Eustathius. Whose ridge o'erlook'd a shady length of land; To learn if aught of mortal works appear, Or chearful voice of mortal strike the ear? From the high point I mark'd, in distant view, A stream of curling smoke ascending blue, And spiry tops, the tufted trees above, Of Circe's Palace bosom'd in the grove. Thither to haste, the region to explore, Was first my thought: but speeding back to shore I deem'd it best to visit first my crew, And send out spies the dubious coast to view. As down the hill I solitary go, Some pow'r divine who pities human woe Sent a tall stag, descending from the wood, To cool his fervor in the crystal flood; Luxuriant on the wave-worn bank he lay, Stretch'd forth, and panting in the sunny ray. I lanc'd my spear, and with a sudden wound Transpierc'd his back, and fix'd him to the ground. He falls, and mourns his fate with human cries: Thro' the wide wound the vital spirit flies. I drew, and casting on the river side The bloody spear, his gather'd feet I ty'd With twining osiers which the bank'd supply'd. An ell in length the pliant whisp I weav'd, And the huge body on my shoulders heav'd: Then leaning on the spear with both my hands, Up-bore my load, and prest the sinking sands With weighty steps, 'till at the ship I threw The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew. Chear up, my friends! it is not yet our fate To glide with ghosts thro' Pluto's gloomy gate. Food in the desart land, behold! is giv'n, Live, and enjoy the providence of heav'n. The joyful crew survey his mighty size, And on the future banquet feast their eyes, As huge in length extended lay the beast; Then wash their hands, and hasten to the feast. There, 'till the setting sun rowl'd down the light, They sate indulging in the genial rite. When evening rose, and darkness cover'd o'er The face of things, we slept along the shore. But when the rosy morning warm'd the east, My men I summon'd, and these words addrest. Followers and friends; attend what I propose: Ye sad companions of Ulysses' woes! We know not here what land before us lies, Or to what quarter now we turn our eyes, Or where the sun shall set, or where shall rise? The interpretations of this passage are various; some, says Eustathius, judge these words not to proceed from the ignorance of Ulysses, but that they are the language of despair suggested by his continual calamities: For how could Ulysses be ignorant of the east or west, when he saw the sun rise and set every day? others understand it to signifie, that he was ignorant of the clime of the world (??? ???????? ????????) in which this Island lay. Strabo was of opinion, that the appearances of the heavenly bodies, as the stars, &amp;c. were different in this Island from the position which he had ever before observ'd in any country, and therefore he might well confess his ignorance, and express his concern for his almost desperate condition. He understands by ??? all that region thro' which the Sun passes opposite to the North. It is true, that the four quarters of the world may be supposed to be here mention'd by Ulysses, ??? may express the southern parts thro' which the sun passes, and ????? the opposite quarter, which may be said comparatively to be ?????, or dark: And then the rising and setting of the sun, will undeniably denote the eastern and western regions. Spondanus is of opinion, that Homer intended to express the four quarters of the world, otherwise the second verse is a tautology: Dacier calls it an explication of the first description. And indeed the mind of man is apt to dwell long upon any object, by which it is deeply affected, as Ulysses must here be supposed to be, and therefore he might enlarge upon the sentiment advanced in the former line. The meaning then will be this. I know not, says that Heroe, where this Island lies, whether east or west, where the Sun rises, or where he sets. I should therefore understand Ulysses to mean, that he knows not how this Island lies with respect to the rest of the world, and especially to Ithaca his own country. This is evident from his conduct when he sail'd from Formiæ the land of the Læstrigons; for instead of making toward the east where Ithaca lay, he bore to this Island of Circe, which lies on the west of Formiæ. Here let us think (if thinking be not vain) If any counsel, any hope remain. This expression may be thought unworthy of the mouth of an Heroe, and serve only to cause his companions to despair; but in reality it has a double effect, it gives us a lively picture of Human Nature, which in the greatest men will shew some degrees of sensibility, and at the same time it arms his friends against surprize, and sets the danger they are in full before their eyes, that they may proceed with due circumspection. We do not find that Ulysses abandons himself to despair, he still acts like a brave man, but joyns wisdom with bravery, and proceeds at once with the caution of a Philosopher, and the spirit of an Heroe. Alas! from yonder Promontory's brow, I view'd the coast, a region flat and low; An Isle incircled with the boundless flood; A length of thickets, and entangled wood. Some smoak I saw amid the forest rise, And all around it only seas and skies! With broken hearts my sad companions stood, Mindful of Cyclops and his human food, And horrid Lestrygons, the men of blood. Presaging tears apace began to rain; But tears in mortal miseries are vain. In equal parts I strait divide my band, And name a chief each party to command; I led the one, and of the other side Appointed brave Eurylochus the guide. Then in the brazen helm the lotts we throw, Dacier is of opinion that Ulysses cast lotts out of an apprehension of being disobey'd if he had given positive commands; his companions being so greatly discourag'd by the adventures of Polypheme and the Læstrigons. It will be a nobler reason, and more worthy of an Heroe to say, that Ulysses was so far from declining a common danger, that he submits himself to an equal chance with his companions to undertake it: This expedition appear'd very hazardous, and if he had directly commanded a select number of his men to attempt it, they might have thought he had exposed them to almost certain destruction; but the contrary conduct takes away this apprehension, and at the same time shews the bravery of Ulysses, who puts himself upon a level with the meanest of his soldiers, and is ready to expose his person to an equality of danger. Ulysses divides his men into two bodies; each contains two and twenty men: This is agreeable, observes Eustathius, to the former account of Homer; each vessel carried fifty men, six out of every one were destroy'd by the Ciconians, and therefore forty four is the exact number, inclusive of himself and the surviving company. And fortune casts Eurylochus to go: He march'd, with twice eleven in his train: Pensive they march, and pensive we remain. The Palace in a woody vale they found, High rais'd of stone; a shaded space around: Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam, Virgil has borrow'd almost this whole description of Circe, and as Scaliger judges, perhaps with good reason, greatly improv'd it. Hinc exaudiri gemitus iræque leonum Vincla recusantum, &amp; serâ sub nocte rudentum, Setigerique sues, atque in præsepibus ursi, &amp;c. From hence we heard rebellowing from the main, The roars of lions that refuse the chain, The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors ears: These from their caverns, at the close of night, Fill the sad Isle with horror and affright: Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r, That watch'd the Moon, and planetary hour, With words and wicked herbs, from human kind Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd. Dryden. It must be confess'd, that Iræ leonum vincla recusantum, and the epithets and short descriptions adapted to the nature of each savage, are beautiful additions. Virgil likewise differs from Homer in the manner of the description: Homer draws the beasts with a gentleness of nature; Virgil paints them with the fierceness of savages. The reason of Homer's conduct is, because they still retain'd the sentiments of men, in the forms of beasts, and consequently their native tenderness. There is a beautiful moral couch'd under this fable or allegory: Homer intended to teach, as Eustathius remarks, that pleasure and sensuality debase men into beasts. Thus Socrates understood it, as Xenophon informs us. Perhaps, adds Dacier, by the fawning wolves and lions that guard the portals of Circe's Palace, the Poet means to represent the attendants of such houses of debauchery, which appear gentle and courteous, but are in reality of a brutal disposition, and more dangerous than lions. But upon what foundation is this fable built? Many writers inform us, that Circe was a famous Courtezan, and that her beauty drew her admirers as it were by enchantment. Thus Horace writes, ? Circes pocula nosti, Qæsi cum sociis stultus, cupidusque bibisset, Sub dominâ Meretrice fuisset turpis &amp; excors, Vixisset camis immundus, vel amica luto sus. It is evident, that Ulysses had a very intimate commerce with Circe, for Hesiod writes that he had two sons by her, Agrius and Latinus, who afterwards reign'd in Tuscany; other Authors call them Nausithous and Telegonus. ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ???????? ??????, ??? ???????. Dyonysius Halicarn. and Aristotle mention Telegonus as the son of Circe and Ulysses, who afterwards slew his father with the bone of a fish inadvertently. Thus Horace, Telegoni juga Parricidæ. But then is not this intrigue a breach of Morality, and conjugal infidelity in that Heroe? I refer the Reader to Note XIV. of the fifth book of the Odyssey: I shall only add, that the notions of Morality are now very different from what they were in former ages: Adultery alone was esteemed criminal, and punish'd with death by the ancient Heathens: Concubinage was not only permitted, but thought to be honourable, as appears from the practice, not only of Heroes, but even of the Pagan Deities; and consequently this was the vice of the age, not in particular of Ulysses. But there is a stronger objection against Ulysses, and it may be asked, how is he to be vindicated for wasting no less space than a whole year in dalliance with an harlot? Penelope and his country seem both forgotten, and consequently he appears to neglect his own re-establishment, the chief design of the Odyssey: What adds some weight to this observation is, that his companions seem more sensible of his long absence from his country, and regret it more than that Heroe; for they awake him out of his dream, and intreat him to depart from the Island. It is therefore necessary to take away this objection: for if it be unanswerable, Ulysses is guilty of all the miseries of his family and country, by neglecting to redress them by returning; and therefore he must cease to be an Heroe, and is no longer to be propos'd as a pattern of Wisdom, and imitation, as he is in the opening of the Odyssey. But the stay of Ulysses is involuntary, and consequently irreproachable; he is in the power of a Deity, and therefore not capable of departing without her permission: this is evident: for upon the remonstrance made by his companions, he dares not undertake his voyage without her dismission. His asking consent plainly shews that it was not safe, if practicable, to go away without it; if he had been a free agent, her leave had been unnecessary: 'tis true, she tells him she will not detain him any longer against his inclinations; but this does not imply that his stay till then had been voluntary, or that he never had intreated to be dismissed before, but rather intimates the contrary: it only shews that now at last she is willing he should go away. But why should Ulysses stand in need of being admonished by his companions? does not this imply that he was unmindful of returning? This is only an evidence that they were desirous to return as well as he; but he makes a wise use of their impatience, and takes an occasion from their importunities to press for an immediate dismission. In short, I am not pleading for perfection in the character of Ulysses: Human Nature allows it not, and therefore it is not to be ascribed to it in Poetry. But if Ulysses were here guilty, his character ceases to be of a piece; we no longer interest our selves in his misfortunes, since they are all owing to his own folly: the nature of the Poem requires, that he should be continually endeavouring to restore his affairs: if then he be here sunk into a Lethargy, his character is at once lost, his calamities are a just punishment, and the moral of the Odyssey is destroy'd, which is to shew Wisdom and Virtue rewarded, and Vice and Folly punished by the death of the suitors, and re-establishment of Ulysses. (By magic tam'd) familiar to the dome. With gentle blandishment our men they meet, And wag their tails, and fawning lick their feet. As from some feast a man returning late, His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate, Rejoicing round, some morsel to receive, (Such as the good man ever us'd to give.) Domestick thus the grisly beasts drew near; They gaze with wonder, not unmixt with fear. Now on the threshold of the dome they stood, And heard a voice resounding thro' the wood: Plac'd at her loom within, the Goddess sung; The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung. O'er the fair web the rising figures shine, Immortal labour! worthy hands divine. Polites to the rest the question mov'd, (A gallant leader, and a man I lov'd.) What voice celestial, chaunting to the loom (Or Nymph, or Goddess) ecchos from the room? Say shall we seek access? With that they call; And wide unfold the portals of the hall. The Goddess rising, asks her guests to stay, Who blindly follow where she leads the way. Eurylochus alone of all the band, Suspecting fraud, more prudently remain'd. On thrones around, with downy coverings grac'd, With semblance fair th'unhappy men she plac'd. Milk newly prest, the sacred flow'r of wheat, And honey fresh, and Pramnian wines the treat: But venom'd was the bread, and mix'd the bowl, It is an undoubted truth, that Homer ascribes more power to these magical drugs and Incantations than they have in reality; but we are to remember that he is speaking before a credulous audience, who readily believed these improbabilities, and at the same time he very judiciously provides for the satisfaction of his more understanding Readers, by couching an excellent moral under his fables; viz. that by indulging our appetites we sink below the dignity of Human Nature, and degenerate into brutality. I am not in the number of those who believe that there never were any Magicians who perform'd things of an uncommon nature: The story of Jannes and Jambres, of the Witch of Endor, and Simon Magus, are undeniable instances of the contrary. Magic is suppos'd to have been first practis'd in Ægypt, and to have spread afterwards among the Chaldeans: It is very evident that Homer had been in Ægypt, where he might hear an account of the wonders perform'd by it. Dacier is of opinion, that these deluders, or Magicians, were mimics of the real miracles of Moses, and that they are described with a wand, in imitation of that great Prophet. But if any person thinks that Magic is mere fable, and never had any existence, yet establish'd fame and common opinion justify a Poet for using it. What has been more ridicul'd than the winds being inclosed in a bag by Æolus, and committed to Ulysses? but as absurd as this appears, more countries than Lapland pretend to the power of selling a storm or a fair wind at this day, as is notorious from travellers of credit: and perhaps a Poet would not even in these ages be thought ridiculous, if speaking of Lapland, he should introduce one of these Venefica's, and describe the ceremonies she used in the performance of her pretended incantations. Milton not unhappily has introduc'd the imagin'd power of these Lapland Witches into his Paradise Lost. ? The night-hag, when call'd In secret, riding thro' the air she comes, Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at their charms. ? In short, Virgil has imitated Homer in all these bold Episodes, and Horace calls them the Miracles of the Odyssey. With drugs of force to darken all the soul: Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost, And drank Oblivion of their native coast. Instant her circling wand the Goddess waves, To hogs transforms 'em, and the Sty receives. No more was seen the human form divine, Longinus here reports a Criticism of Zoilus; he is very pleasant upon this transformation of the companions of Ulysses, and calls them, the squeaking pigs of Homer: we may gather from this instance the nature of his Criticisms, and conjecture that they tended to turn the finest incidents of Homer into ridicule. Burlesque was his talent, and instead of informing the reason by pointing out the errors of the Poem, his only aim was to make his Readers laugh; but he drew upon himself the indignation of all the learned world: he was known by the name of the vile Thracian slave, and liv'd in great want and poverty; and posterity prosecutes his memory with the same animosity. The man was really very learned, as Dionysius Halicarn. informs us: His morals were never reproach'd, and yet, as Vitruvius relates, he was crucify'd by Ptolemy, or as others write, ston'd to death, or burnt alive at Smyrna; so that his only crime was his defamation of Homer: a tragical instance of the great value which was set upon his Poetry by antiquity, and of the danger of attacking a celebrated Author with malice and envy. Head, face and members bristle into swine: Still curst with sense, their minds remains alone, And their own voice affrights them when they groan. Mean while the Goddess in disdain bestows The mast and acorn, brutal food! and strows The fruits of cornel, as their feast, around; Now prone, and groveling on unsav'ry ground. Eurylochus with pensive steps and slow, Aghast returns; the messenger of woe, And bitter fate. To speak he made essay, In vain essay'd, nor would his tongue obey, His swelling heart deny'd the words their way: But speaking tears the want of words supply, And the full soul bursts copious from his eye. Affrighted, anxious for our fellows fates, We press to hear what sadly he relates. We went, Ulysses! (such was thy command) We have here a very lively picture of a person in a great fright, which was admir'd, observes Eustathius, by the Ancients: There is not only a remarkable harmony in the flowing of the Poetry, but the very manner of speaking represents the disorder of the speaker; he is in too great an emotion to introduce his speech by any Preface, he breaks at once into it, without preparation, as if he could not soon enough deliver his thoughts. Longinus quotes these lines as an instance of the great judgment of Homer: there is nothing, says that Critic, which gives more life to a discourse, than the taking away the connections and conjunctions; when the discourse is not bound together and embarrass'd, it walks and slides along of it self, and will want very little oftentimes of going faster even than the thought of the Orator: Thus in Xenophon, Joining their bucklers, they gave back, they fought, they slew, they dy'd together; of the same nature is that of Eurylochus, We went, Ulysses—such was thy command— Access we sought—nor was access deny'd: Radiant she came—the portals open'd wide, &amp;c. I only wait behind—of all the train; I waited long—and ey'd the doors in vain: The rest are vanish'd—none repass'd the gate. These periods thus cut off, and yet pronounc'd with precipitation, are signs of a lively sorrow; which at the same time hinders, yet forces him to speak. Many such hidden transitions are to be found in Virgil, of equal beauty with this of Homer: Me, me, inquam qui feci, in me convertite tela, Here the Poet shews the earnestness of the speaker who is in so much haste to speak, that his thoughts run to the end of the sentence almost before his tongue can begin it. Thus Achæmenides in his flight from the Cyclops, ? Per sidera testor, Per superos, atque hoc cœli spirabile lumen, Tollite me, Teueri. Here the Poet makes no connection with the preceding discourse, but leaves out the inquit, to express the precipitation and terror of Achæmenides. But our countryman Spenser has equall'd if not surpass'd these great Poets of Antiquity, in painting a figure of Terror in the ninth Canto of the Fairy Queen, where Sir Trevisan flies from Despair. He answer'd nought at all: but adding now Fear to his first amazement, staring wide With stony eyes, and heartless hollow hue, Astonish'd stood, as one that had espy'd Infernal furies, with their chains unty'd; Him yet again, and yet again bespake The gentle Knight; who nought to him reply'd, But trembling every joint did inly quake, And fault'ring tongue at last, these words seem'd forth to shake, For God's dear love, Sir Knight, do me not stay, For lo! he comes, he comes, fast after me, Eft looking back, would fain have run away. The description sets the figure full before our eyes, he speaks short, and in broken and interrupted periods, which excellently represent, and in broken and interrupted periods, which excellently represent the agony of his thoughts; and when he is a little more confirm'd and embolden'd, he proceeds, And am I now in safety sure, quoth he, From him who would have forced me to die? And is the point of Death now turn'd from me? Then I may tell this hapless History. We see he breaks out into interrogations, which, as Longinus observes, give great motion, strength, and action to discourse. If the Poet had proceeded simply, the expression had not been equal to the occasion; but by these short questions, he gives strength to it, and shews the disorder of the speaker, by the sudden starts and vehemence of the periods. The whole Canto of Despair is a piece of inimitable Poetry; the picture of Sir Trevisan has a general resemblance to this of Eurylochus, and seems to have been copy'd after it, as will appear upon comparison. Thro' the lone thicket, and the desart land. A Palace in a woody vale we found Brown with dark forests, and with shades around. A voice celestial eccho'd from the doom, Or Nymph, or Goddess, chaunting to the loom. Access we sought, nor was access deny'd: Radiant she came; the portals open'd wide: The Goddess mild invites the guests to stay: They blindly follow where she leads the way. I only wait behind, of all the train; I waited long, and ey'd the doors in vain: The rest are vanish'd, none repass'd the gate; And not a man appears to tell their fate. I heard, and instant o'er my shoulders flung The belt in which my weighty faulchion hung; (A beamy blade) then seiz'd the bended bow, And bad him guide the way, resolv'd to go. He, prostrate falling, with both hands embrac'd The character of Eurylochus, who had married Climene the sister of Ulysses, is the character of a brave man, who being witness to the dreadful fate of his companions is diffident of himself, and judges that the only way to conquer the danger is to fly from it. To fear upon such an occasion, observes Dacier, is not Cowardice, but Wisdom. But what is more remarkable in this description, is the art of Homer in inserting the character of a brave man under so great a consternation, to set off the character of Ulysses, who knows how at once to be bold and wise; for the more terrible and desperate the adventure is represented by Eurylochus, the greater appears the intrepidity of Ulysses, who trusting to his own wisdom, and the assistance of the Gods, has the courage to attempt it. What adds to the merit of the action is, that he undertakes it solely for his companions, as Horace describes him: Dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa Pertulit, adversis rerum immersabilis undis. My knees, and weeping thus his suit address'd. O King belov'd of Jove! thy servant spare, And ah, thy self the rash attempt forbear! Never, alas! thou never shalt return, Or see the wretched for whose loss we mourn. With what remains, from certain ruin fly, And save the few not fated yet to die. I answer'd stern. Inglorious then remain, This expression is used sarcastically by Ulysses, and in derision of his fears. Dacier remarks, that Ulysses having not seen what is related by Eurylochus, believes his refusal to return, proceeds from his faint-heartedness: An instance, adds she, that we frequently form wrong judgments of mens actions, when we are ignorant of the motives of them. I confess I am of opinion, that there is some degree of cowardice in the character of Eurylochus: A man truly brave would not express such confusion and terror in any extremity; he is not to be inspirited either by Ulysses, or the example of his other companions, as appears from the sequel, insomuch that Ulysses threatens to kill him for a coward; this prevails over his first fears, and he submits to meet a future danger, merely to avoid one that is present. What makes this observation more just is, that we never see a brave man drawn by Homer or Virgil in such faint colours; but they always discover a presence of mind upon all emergencies. Here feast and loiter, and desert thy train. Alone, unfriended, will I tempt my way; The laws of Fate compell, and I obey. This said, and scornful turning from the shore My haughty step, I stalk'd the vally o'er. 'Till now approaching nigh the magic bow'r, Where dwelt th'enchantress skill'd in herbs of pow'r; A form divine forth issu'd from the wood, (Immortal Hermes with the golden rod) In human semblance. On his bloomy face Youth smil'd celestial, with each opening grace. He seiz'd my hand, and gracious thus began. Ah whither roam'st thou? much-enduring man! O blind to fate! what led thy steps to rove The horrid mazes of this magic grove? Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies, All lost their form, and habitants of styes. Think'st thou by wit to model their escape? Sooner shalt thou, a stranger to thy shape, Fall prone their equal: First thy danger know. Then take the antidote the Gods bestow. The plant I give thro' all the direful bow'r Shall guard thee, and avert the evil hour. Now hear her wicked arts. Before thy eyes The bowl shall sparkle, and the banquet rise; Take this, nor from the faithless feast abstain, For temper'd drugs and poysons shall be vain. Soon as she strikes her wand, and gives the word, Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword, And menace death: those menaces shall move Her alter'd mind to blandishment and love. Nor shun the blessing proffer'd to thy arms, Ascend her bed, and taste celestial charms: So shall thy tedious toils a respite find, And thy lost friends return to humankind. But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie The pow'rs below, the blessed in the sky; Lest to the naked secret fraud be meant, Or magic bind thee, cold and impotent. Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew, This whole passage is to be understood allegorically. Mercury is Reason, he being the God of Science: The plant which he gives as a preservative against incantation is instruction; the root of it is black, the flower white and sweet; the root denotes that the foundation or principles of instruction appear obscure and bitter, and are distasteful at first, according to that saying of Plato, The beginnings ef instruction are always accompanied with reluctance and pain. The flower of Moly is white and sweet; this denotes that the fruits of instruction are sweet, agreeable, and nourishing. Mercury gives this plant; this intimates, that all instruction is the gift of Heaven: Mercury brings it not with him, but gathers it from the place where he stands, to shew that Wisdom is not confin'd to places, but that every where it may be found, if Heaven vouchsafes to discover it, and we are disposed to receive and follow it. Thus Isocrates understands the Allegory of Moly; he adds, ?????? ????? ????? ????? ?? ?? ?????? ?????, ?????? ???? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????????, ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ????????. The root of Moly is bitter, but the flower of it white as milk, to denote the excellency of instruction, as well as the pleasure and utility of it in the end. He further illustrates the Allegory, by adding ??????? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????, &amp;c. That is, “the fruits of instruction are not only white as milk, but sweet though they spring from a bitter root. Eustathius. Maximus Tyrius also gives this story an allegorical sense, Dissert. 16. ????? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ????, ?? ????????? ????????? ?????????????? ????? ?????, ????? ???? ?? ?? ?????? ????, ????? ?? ?? ??????? ?????????; that is, “Dost thou not observe Ulysses, how by opposing virtue to adversity he preserves his life? This is the Scarf that protects him from Circe, this is the Scarf that delivers him from the storm, from Polypheme, from Hell, &amp;c. See also Dissert. 19. It is pretended that Moly is an Ægyptian plant, and that it was really made use of as a preservative against Enchantments: but I believe the Moly of Mercury, and the Nepenthe of Helen, are of the same production, and grow only in Poetical ground. Ovid has translated this passage in his Metamorphosis, lib. 14. Pacifer huic dederat florem Cyllenius album; Moly vocant Superi, nigrâ radice tenetur, &amp;c. There is a remarkable sweetness in the verse which describes the appearance of Mercury in the shape of a young man; ? ?????? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ? On his bloomy face Youth smil'd celestial ? Virgil was sensible of the beauty of it, and imitated it. Ora puer primâ signans intonsa juventâ. But in the opinion of Macrobius, he falls short of Homer, lib. 5. Saturn 13. Prætermissâ gratiâ incipientis pubertatis ??? ??? ?????????? Minus gratam fecit latinam descriptionem. Where on th'all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew, And shew'd its nature and its wondr'rous pow'r: Black was the root, but milky white the flow'r; Moly the name, to mortals hard to find, But all is easy to th'ethereal kind. This Hermes gave, then gliding off the glade Shot to Olympus from the woodland shade, While full of thought, revolving fates to come, I speed my passage to th'enchanted dome: Arriv'd, before the lofty gates I stay'd; The lofty gates the Goddess wide display'd: She leads before, and to the feast invites; I follow sadly to the magic rites. Radiant with starry studs, a silver seat Receiv'd my limbs; a footstool eas'd my feet. She mix'd the potion, fraudulent of soul; The poison mantled in the golden bowl. I took, and quaff'd it, confident in heav'n: It may be ask'd if Ulysses is not as culpable as his companions, in drinking this potion? Where lies the difference? and how is the Allegory carried on, when Ulysses yields to the solicitation of Circe, that is Pleasure, and indulges, not resists his appetites? The moral of the fable is, that all pleasure is not unlawful, but the access of it: We may enjoy, provided it be with moderation. Ulysses does not taste till he is fortify'd against it; whereas his companions yielded without any care or circumspection; they indulged their appetites only, Ulysses tastes merely out of a desire to deliver his associates: he makes himself master of Circe, or Pleasure, and is not in the power of it, and enjoys it upon his own terms; they are slaves to it, and out of a capacity ever to regain their freedom but by the assistance of Ulysses. The general moral of the whole fable of Circe is, that pleasure is as dreadful an enemy as Danger, and a Circe as hard to be conquer'd as a Polypheme. Then wav'd the wand, and then the word was giv'n. Hence, to thy fellows! (dreadful she began) Go, be a beast!—I heard, and yet was man. Then sudden whirling like a waving flame My beamy faulchion, I assault the dame. Struck with unusual fear, she trembling cries, She faints, she falls; she lifts her weeping eyes. What art thou? say! from whence, from whom you came? O more than human! tell thy race, thy name. Amazing strength, these poysons to sustain! Not mortal thou, nor mortal is thy brain. Or art thou he? the man to come (foretold By Hermes pow'rful with the wand of gold) The man from Troy, who wander'd Ocean round; The man, for Wisdom's various arts renown'd. Ulysses? oh! thy threat'ning fury cease, Sheath thy bright sword, and join our hands in peace; Let mutual joys our mutual trust combine, And Love and love-born confidence be thine. And how, dread Circe! (furious I rejoyn) Can Love and love-born confidence be mine? Beneath thy charms when my companions groan, Transform'd to beasts, with accents not their own. O thou of fraudful heart! shall I be led Eustathius observes, that we have here the picture of a man truly wise, who when Pleasure courts him to indulge his appetites, not only knows how to abstain, but suspects it to be a bait to draw him into some inconveniencies: A man should never think himself in security in the house of a Circe. It may be added, that these apprehensions of Ulysses are not without a foundation; from this intercourse with that Goddess, Telegonus sprung, who accidentally slew his father Ulysses. To share thy feast-rites, or ascend thy bed; That, all unarm'd, thy vengeance may have vent, And magic bind me, cold and impotent? Celestial as thou art, yet stand deny'd: Or swear that oath by which the Gods are ty'd, Swear, in thy soul no latent frauds remain, Swear, by the Vow which never can be vain. The Goddess swore: then seiz'd my hand, and led To the sweet transports of the genial bed. Ministrant to their Queen, with busy care Four faithful handmaids the soft rites prepare; This large description of the entertainment in the Palace of Circe is particularly judicious; Ulysses is in an house of pleasure, and the Poet dwells upon it, and shews how every circumstance contributes to promote and advance it. The attendants are all Nymphs, and the bath and perfumes usher in the feast and wines. The four verses that follow, are omitted by Dacier, and they are mark'd in Eustathius as superfluous; they are to be found in other parts of the Odyssey; but that, I confess, would be no argument why they should not stand here, (such repetitions being frequent in Homer) if they had a due propriety, but they contain a tautology; we see before a table spread for the entertainment of Ulysses, why then should that circumstance be repeated? If they are omitted, there will no chasm or incoherence appear, and therefore probably they were not originally inserted here by Homer. Nymphs sprung from fountains, or from shady woods, Or the fair offspring of the sacred floods. One o'er the couches painted carpets threw, Whose purple lustre glow'd against the view: White linen lay beneath. Another plac'd The silver stands with golden flaskets grac'd: With dulcet bev'rage this the beaker crown'd, Fair in the midst, with gilded cups around: That in the tripod o'er the kindled pyle The water pours; the bubling waters boil: An ample vase receives the smoking wave, And in the bath prepar'd, my limbs I lave; Reviving sweets repair the mind's decay, And take the painful sense of toil away. A vest and tunick o'er me next she threw, Fresh from the bath and dropping balmy dew; Then led and plac'd me on the sov'reign seat, With carpets spread; a footstool at my feet. The golden ew'r a nymph obsequious brings, Replenish'd from the cool, translucent springs; With copious water the bright vase supplies A silver laver of capacious size. I wash'd. The table in fair order spread, They heap the glittering canisters with bread; Viands of various kinds allure the taste, Of choicest sort and savour, rich repaste! Circe in vain invites the feast to share; Absent I ponder, and absorpt in care: While scenes of woe rose anxious in my breast, The Queen beheld me, and these words addrest. Why sits Ulysses silent and apart? Some hoard of grief close harbour'd at his heart. Untouch'd before thee stand the cates divine, And unregarded laughs the rosy wine. Can yet a doubt, or any dread remain, When sworn that oath which never can be vain? I answer'd, Goddess! Human is thy breast, By justice sway'd, by tender pity prest: Ill fits it me, whose friends are sunk to beasts, To quaff thy bowls, or riot in thy feasts. Me wou'dst thou please? for them thy cares imploy. And them to me restore, and me to joy. With that, she parted: In her potent hand She bore the virtue of the magic wand. Then hast'ning to the styes set wide the door, Urg'd forth, and drove the bristly herd before; Unweildy, out They rush'd, with gen'ral cry, Enormous beasts dishonest to the eye. Now touch'd by counter-charms, they change agen, And stand majestic, and recall'd to men. Those hairs of late that bristled ev'ry part, Fall off, miraculous effect of art: 'Till all the form in full proportion rise, More young, more large, more graceful to my eyes. Homer excellently carries on his allegory; he intends by this expression of the enlargement of the beauty of Ulysses's companions, to teach that men who turn from an evil course, into the paths of Virtue, excel even themselves; having learn'd the value of Virtue from the miseries they suffer'd in pursuit of Vice, they become new men, and as it were enjoy a second life. Eustathius. They saw, they knew me, and with eager pace Clung to their master in a long embrace: Sad, pleasing sight! with tears each eye ran o'er, And sobs of joy re-eccho'd thro' the bow'r: Ev'n Circe wept, her adamantine heart Felt pity enter, and sustain'd her part. Son of Laertes! (then the Queen began) Oh much-enduring, much-experienc'd man! Haste to thy vessel on the sea-beat shore, Unload thy treasures, and thy gally moor; Then bring thy friends, secure from future harms, And in our grotto's stow thy spoils and arms. She said. Obedient to her high command I quit the place, and hasten to the strand. My sad companions on the beach I found, Their wistful eyes in floods of sorrow drown'd. As from fresh pastures and the dewy field If this simile were to be render'd literally it would run thus; “as calves seeing the droves of cows returning at night when they are fill'd with their pasturage, run skipping out to meet them; the stalls no longer detain them, but running round their dams they fill the plain with their lowings, &amp;c.” If a similitude of this nature were to be introduced into modern Poetry, I am of opinion it would fall under ridicule for a want of delicacy: but in reality, images drawn from Nature, and a rural life, have always a very good effect; in particular, this before us enlivens a melancholy description of sorrows, and so exactly expresses in every point the joy of Ulysses's companions, we see them in the very description. To judge rightly of comparison, we are not to examine if the subject from whence they are deriv'd be great or little, noble or familiar, but we are principally to consider if the image produc'd be clear and lively, if the Poet have skill to dignifie it by Poetical words, and if it perfectly paints the thing it is intended to represent. This rule fully vindicates Homer, tho' he frequently paints low life, yet he never uses terms which are not noble; or if he uses humble words or phrases, it is with so much art, that, as Dionysius observes, they become noble and harmonious: In short, a Top may be used with propriety and elegance in a similitude by a Virgil, and the Sun may be dishonour'd by a Mævius; a mean thought express'd in noble terms being more tolerable, than a noble thought disgrac'd by mean expressions. Things that have an intrinsic greatness need only to be barely represented to fill the soul with admiration, but it shews the skill of a Poet to raise a low subject, and exalt common appearances into dignity. (When loaded cribs their evening banquet yield) The lowing herds return; around them throng With leaps and bounds their late-imprison'd young, Rush to their mothers with unruly joy, And ecchoing hills return the tender cry: So round me press'd exulting at my sight, With cries and agonies of wild delight, The weeping sailors; nor less fierce their joy Than if return'd to Ithaca from Troy. Ah master! ever-honour'd, ever dear, (These tender words on ev'ry side I hear) What other joy can equal thy return? Not that lov'd country for whose sight we mourn, The soil that nurs'd us, and that gave us breath: But ah! relate our lost companions death. I answer'd chearful. Haste, your gally moor, And bring our treasures and our arms a-shore: Those in yon hollow caverns let us lay; Then rise and follow where I lead the way. Your fellows live: believe your eyes, and come To taste the joys of Circe's sacred dome. With ready speed the joyful crew obey: Alone Eurylochus persuades their stay. Whither (he cry'd) ah whither will ye run? Seek ye to meet those evils ye shou'd shun? Will you the terrors of the dome explore, In swine to grovel, or in lions roar, Or wolf-like howl away the midnight hour In dreadful watch around the magic bow'r? Remember Cyclops, and his bloody deed; The Poet paints Eurylochus uniformly, under great disorder of mind and terrible apprehensions: There is no similitude between Circe and Cyclops, with respect to the usage of the companions of Ulysses; but Homer puts these expressions into his mouth, to represent the nature of Terror, which confounds the thoughts, and consequently distracts the language of a person who is possessed by it. The character therefore of Eurylochus is the imitation of a person confounded with fears, speaking irrrationally and incoherently. Eustathius. The leader's rashness made the soldiers bleed. I heard incens'd, and first resolv'd to speed My flying faulchion at the rebels head. Dear as he was, by ties of kindred bound, This hand had stretch'd him breathless on the ground; But all at once my interposing train For mercy pleaded, nor could plead in vain. Leave here the man who dares his Prince desert, Leave to repentance and his own sad heart, To guard the ship. Seek we the sacred shades Of Circe's Palace, where Ulysses leads. This with one voice declar'd, the rising train Left the black vessel by the murm'ring main. Shame touch'd Eurylochus his alter'd breast, He fear'd my threats, and follow'd with the rest. Mean-while the Goddess, with indulgent cares And social joys, the late-transform'd repairs: The bath, the feast, their fainting soul renews; Rich in refulgent robes, and dropping balmy dews: Brightning with joy their eager eyes behold Each others face, and each his story told: Then gushing tears the narrative confound, And with their sobs the vaulted roofs resound. When hush'd their passion, thus the Goddess cries: Ulysses, taught by labours to be wise, Let this short memory of grief suffice. To me are known the various woes ye bore, In storms by sea, in perils on the shore; Forget whatever was in Fortune's pow'r, And share the pleasures of this genial hour. Such be your minds as ere ye left your coast, Or learn'd to sorrow for a country lost. Exiles and wand'rers now, where-e'er ye go, Too faithful memory renews your woe; The cause remov'd, habitual griefs remain, And the soul saddens by the use of pain. Her kind intreaty mov'd the gen'ral breast; Tir'd with long toil, we willing sunk to rest. We ply'd the banquet and the bowl we crown'd, 'Till the full circle of the year came round. But when the seasons, following in their train, Brought back the months, the days, and hours again; As from a lethargy at once they rise, And urge their chief with animating cries. Is this, Ulysses, our inglorious lot? And is the name of Ithaca forgot? Shall never the dear land in prospect rise, Or the lov'd palace glitter in our eyes? Melting I heard; yet till the sun's decline Prolong'd the feast, and quaff'd the rosy wine: But when the shades came on at evening hour, And all lay slumbring in the dusky bow'r; I came a suppliant to fair Circe's bed, The tender moment seiz'd, and thus I said. Be mindful, Goddess, of thy promise made; Must sad Ulysses ever be delay'd? Around their lord my sad companions mourn, Each breast beats homeward, anxious to return: If but a moment parted from thy eyes, Their tears flow round me, and my heart complies. Go then, (she cry'd) ah go! yet think, not I, Not Circe, but the Fates your wish deny. Ah hope not yet to breathe thy native air! Far other journey first demands thy care; There should in all the Episodes of Epic Poetry appear a Convenience, if not a necessity of every incident; it may therefore be ask'd what Necessity there is for this descent of Ulysses into hell, to consult the shade of Tiresias? Could not Circe, who was a Goddess, discover to him all the future contingencies of his life? Eustathius excellently answers this objection; Circe declares to Ulysses the necessity of consulting Tiresias, that he may learn from the mouth of that Prophet, that his death was to be from the Ocean; she acts thus in order to dispose him to stay with her, after his return from the regions of the dead: or if she cannot persuade him to stay with her, that she may at least secure him from returning to her rival Calypso; she had promised him Immortality, but by this descent, he will learn that it is decreed that he should receive his death from the Ocean; for he died by the bone of a seafish call'd Xiphias. Her love for Ulysses induces her not to make the discovery her self, for it was evident she would not find credit, but Ulysses would impute it to her love, and the desire she had to deter him from leaving her Island. This will appear more probable, if we observe the conduct of Circe in the future parts of the Odyssey: she relates to him the dangers of Scylla and Charybdis, of the Oxen of Phœbus, and the Sirens; but says nothing concerning his death: This likewise gives an air of probability to the relation. The Isle of Circe was adjoining to Scylla and Charybdis, &amp;c. and consequently she may be supposed to be acquainted with those places, and give an account of them to Ulysses with exactness, but she leaves the decrees of Heaven and the fate of Ulysses to the narration of the Prophet, it best suiting his character to see into futurity. By the descent of Ulysses into Hell may be signify'd, that a wise man ought to be ignorant of nothing, that he ought to ascend in thought into Heaven, and understand the heavenly appearances, and be acquainted with what is contained in the bowels of the earth, and bring to light the secrets of Nature: that he ought to know the nature of the Soul, what it suffers, and how it acts after it is separated from the body. Eustathius. To tread th'uncomfortable paths beneath, And view the realms of darkness and of death. There seek the Theban Bard, depriv'd of sight, Within, irradiate with prophetic light; To whom Persephone, entire and whole, Homer here gives the reason why Tiresias should be consulted, rather than any other ghost, because ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ????. This expression is fully explain'd, and the notion of the soul after death, which prevail'd among the Antients, is set in a clear light, Verse 92, and 122, of the 23d book of the Iliads, to which passages I refer the Readers. But whence had Tiresias this privilege above the rest of the dead? Callimachus ascribes it to Minerva, ??? ????? ???? ????, ?????????? ?? ???????? ????????, ?????? ?????? ???????. Tully mentions this preheminence of Tiresias in his first book of Divination. Perhaps the whole fiction may arise from his great reputation among the Antients for Prophecy; and in honour to his memory they might imagine that his soul after death retain'd the same superiority. Ovid in his Metamorphoses gives us a very jocular reason, for the blindness and prophetic knowledge of Tiresias, from a matrimonial contest between Jupiter and Juno. Cato Major, as Plutarch in his Political Precepts informs us, apply'd this verse to Scipio, when he was made Consul contrary to the Roman Statutes. ???? ????????, ??? ?? ????? ?????????. But I ought not to suppress what Diodorus Siculus relates concerning Tiresias. Biblioth. lib. 4. he tells us, that he had a daughter nam'd Daphne, a Priestess at Delphi. ???? ?? ???? ??? ??? ??????? ?????? ????? ??? ???? ?????????????, ???????? ??? ????? ???????. That is, “From whom it is said, that the Poet Homer received many (of the Sibyls) verses, and adorn'd his own Poetry with them.” If this be true, there lay a debt of gratitude upon Homer, and he pays it honourably, by this distinguishing character, which he gives to the father. An instance of a worthy disposition in the Poet, and it remains at once an honour to Tiresias, and a monument of his own gratitude. This descent of Ulysses into Hell has a very happy effect, it gives Homer an opportunity to embellish his Poetry with an admirable variety, and to insert Fables and Histories that at once instruct and delight. It is particularly happy with respect to the Phæacians, who could not but highly admire a person whose wisdom had not only deliver'd him from so many perils on earth, but had been permitted by the Gods to see the regions of the dead, and return among the living: this relation could not fail of pleasing an audience, delighted with strange stories, and extraordinary adventures. Gave to retain th'unseparated soul: The rest are forms of empty Æther made, Impassive semblance, and a flitting shade. Struck at the word, my very heart was dead: Pensive I sate; my tears bedew'd the bed; To hate the light and life my soul begun, And saw that all was grief beneath the sun, Compos'd at length, the gushing tears supprest, And my tost limbs now weary'd into rest, How shall I tread (I cry'd) ah Circe! say, The dark descent, and who shall guide the way? Can living eyes behold the realms below? What bark to waft me, and what wind to blow? Thy fated road (the magic Pow'r reply'd) Divine Ulysses! asks no mortal guide. Rear but the mast, the spacious sail display, The northern winds shall wing thee on thy way. Soon shalt thou reach old Ocean's utmost ends, This whole scene is excellently imagin'd by the Poet, as Eustathius observes; the trees are all barren, the place is upon the shores where nothing grows; and all the rivers are of a melancholy signification, suitable to the ideas we have of those infernal regions. Ulysses arrives at this place, where he calls up the shades of the dead, in the space of one day; from whence we may conjecture, that he means a place that lies between Cumæ and Baiæ, near the lake Avernus, in Italy; which, as Strabo remarks, is the scene of the Necromancy of Homer, according to the opinion of Antiquity. He further adds, that there really are such rivers as Homer mentions, tho' not placed in their true situation, according to the liberty allowable to Poetry. Others write, that the Cimmerii once inhabited Italy, and that the famous cave of Pausilipe was begun by them about the time of the Trojan wars: Here they offered sacrifice to the Manes, which might give occasion to Homer's fiction. The Grecians, who inhabited these places after the Cimmerians, converted these dark habitations into stoves, bathes, &amp;c. Silius Italicus writes, that the Lucrine lake was antiently call'd Cocytus, lib. 12. Ast hic Lucrino mansisse vocabula quondam Cocyti memorat. ? It is also probable, that Acheron was the antient name of Avernus, because Acherusia, a large water near Cumæ, flows into it by conceal'd passages. Silius Italicus informs us, that Avernus was also called Styx. Ille olim populis dictum Styga, nomine verso, Stagna inter celebrem nunc mitia monstrat Avernum. Here Hannibal offer'd sacrifice to the Manes, as it is recorded by Livy; and Tully affirms it from an antient Poet, from whom he quotes the following fragment; Inde in viciniâ nostrâ Averni lacus Unde animæ excitantur obscurâ umbrâ, Alti Acherontis aperto ostio. This may seem to justifie the observation that Acheron was once the name of Avernus, tho' the words are capable of a different interpretation. If these remarks be true, it is probable that Homer does not neglect Geography, as most Commentators judge. Virgil describes Æneas descending into Hell by Avernus, after the example of Homer. Milton places these rivers in Hell, and beautifully describes their natures, in his Paradise Lost. ? Along the banks Of four Infernal rivers, that disgorge Into the burning lake their baleful streams, Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; Sad Acheron, of sorrow, black and deep: Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream: fierce Phlegeton, Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage; Far off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe, the river of oblivion, rouls Her watry Labyrinth, whereof who drinks Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Thus also agreeably to the idea of Hell the offerings to the infernal powers are all black, the Cimmerians lie in a land of darkness; the Heifer which Ulysses is to offer is barren, like that in Virgil. ? Sterilemque tibi, Proserpina, Vaccam; to denote that the grave is unfruitful, that it devours all things, that it is a place where all things are forgotten. Where to the main the shelving shore descends; The barren trees of Proserpine's black woods, Poplars and willows trembling o'er the floods: There fix thy vessel in the lonely bay, And enter there the kingdoms void of day: Where Phlegeton's loud torrents rushing down, Hiss in the flaming gulf of Acheron; And where, slow rolling from the Stygian bed, Cocytus' lamentable waters spread; Where the dark rock o'erhangs th'infernal lake, And mingling streams eternal murmurs make. First draw thy faulchion, and on ev'ry side Trench the black earth a cubit long and wide: To all the shades around libations pour, And o'er th'ingredients strow the hallow'd flour: New wine and milk, with honey temper'd, bring, And living water from the crystal spring. Then the wan shades and feeble ghosts implore, With promis'd off'rings on thy native shore; A barren cow, the stateliest of the Isle, And, heap'd with various wealth, a blazing pyle: These to the rest; but to the Seer must bleed A sable ram, the pride of all thy breed. These solemn vows and holy offrings paid To all the Phantom-nations of the dead; Be next thy care the sable sheep to place Full o'er the pit, and hell-ward turn their face: But from the infernal rite thine eye withdraw, And back to Ocean glance with rev'rend awe. Sudden shall skim along the dusky glades Thin airy shoals, and visionary shades. Then give command the sacrifice to haste, Let the flea'd Victims in the flames be cast, And sacred vows, and mystic song, apply'd To grisly Pluto, and his gloomy bride. Wide o'er the pool thy faulchion wav'd around Shall drive the spectres from forbidden ground: The sacred draught shall all the dead forbear, 'Till awful from the shades arise the Seer. Let him, Oraculous, the end, the way, The turns of all thy future fate, display, Thy pilgrimage to come, and remnant of thy day. So speaking, from the ruddy orient shone The morn conspicuous on her golden throne: The Goddess with a radiant tunick drest My limbs, and o'er me cast a silken vest. Long flowing robes of purest white array The nymph, that added lustre to the day: A Tiar wreath'd her head with many a fold; Her waste was circled with a zone of gold. Forth issuing then, from place to place I flew; Rouze man by man, and animate my crew. Rise, rise my mates! 'tis Circe gives command; Our journey calls us; haste, and quit the land. All rise and follow, yet depart not all, For fate decreed one wretched man to fall. A youth there was, Elpenor was he nam'd, Homer dismisses not the description of this house of Pleasure and Debauch, without shewing the Moral of his Fable, which is the ill consequences that attend those who indulge themselves in sensuality; this is set forth in the punishment of Elpenor. He describes him as a person of no worth, to shew that debauchery enervates our faculties, and renders both the mind and body incapable of thinking, or acting with greatness and bravery. At the same time these circumstantial relations are not without a good effect; for they render the story probable, as if it were spoken with the veracity of an History, not the liberty of Poetry. I will conclude this book with a Paragraph from Plutarch's Morals: It is a piece of advice to the Fair Sex, drawn from this story of Circe and Ulysses. “They who bait their hooks (says this Philosopher) with intoxicated drugs may catch fish with little trouble; but then they prove dangerous to eat, and unpleasant to the taste: Thus women who use arts to ensnare their admirers, become wives of fools and madmen: They whom the sorceress Circe enchanted, were no better than brutes; and she used them accordingly, enclosing them with styes; but she lov'd Ulysses entirely, whose prudence avoided her intoxications, and made his conversation agreeable. Those women who will not believe that Pasiphae was ever enamour'd of a bull, are yet themselves so extravagant, as to abandon the society of men of sense and temperance, and to betake themselves to the embraces of brutal and stupid fellows.” Plut. Conjugal Precepts. Nor much for sense, nor much for courage fam'd; The youngest of our band, a vulgar soul Born but to banquet, and to drain the bowl. He, hot and careless, on a turret's height With sleep repair'd the long debauch of night: The sudden tumult stirr'd him where he lay, And down he hasten'd, but forgot the way; Full endlong from the roof the sleeper fell, And snap'd the spinal joint, and wak'd in hell. The rest crowd round me with an eager look; I met them with a sigh, and thus bespoke. Already, friends! ye think your toils are o'er, Your hopes already touch your native shore: Alas! far otherwise the nymph declares, Far other journey first demands our cares; To tread th'uncomfortable paths beneath, The dreary realms of darkness and of death: To seek Tiresias' awful shade below, And thence our fortunes and our fates to know. My sad companions heard in deep despair; Frantic they tore their manly growth of hair; To earth they fell; the tears began to rain; But tears in mortal miseries are vain. Sadly they far'd along the sea-beat shore; Still heav'd their hearts, and still their eyes ran o'er. The ready victims at our bark we found, The sable ewe, and ram, together bound. For swift as thought, the Goddess had been there, And thence had glided, viewless as the air: The paths of Gods what mortal can survey? Who eyes their motion, who shall trace their way? THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The descent into Hell. Ulysses continues his Narration, How he arriv'd at the land of the Cimmerians, and what Ceremonies he perform'd to invoke the dead. The manner of his descent, and the Apparition of the Shades; his conversation with Elpenor, and with Tiresias, who informs him in a prophetic manner of his fortunes to come. He meets his mother Anticlea, from whom he learns the state of his family. He sees the shades of the antient Heroines, afterwards of the Heroes, and converses in particular with Agamemnon and Achilles. Ajax keeps at a sullen distance, and disdains to answer him. He then beholds Tityus, Tantalus, Sysiphus, Hercules; 'till he is deterred from further curiosity by the apparition of horrid Spectres, and the cries of the wicked in torments. The Antients call'd this book ????????????, or ?????, the book of Necromancy: because (says Eustathius) it contains an interview between Ulysses, and the shades of the dead. Virgil has not only borrow'd the general design from Homer, but imitated many particular incidents: L' Abbé Fraguier in the Memoirs of Literature gives his judgment in favour of the Roman Poet, and justly observes, that the end and design of the journey is more important in Virgil than in Homer. Ulysses descends to consult Tiresias, Æneas his father. Ulysses takes a review of the shades of celebrated persons that preceded his times, or whom he knew at Troy, who have no relation to the story of the Odyssey: Æneas receives the History of his own Posterity; his father instructs him how to manage the Italian war, and how to conclude it with honour; that is, to lay the foundations of the greatest Empire in the world: and the Poet by a very happy address takes an opportunity to pay a noble compliment to his Patron Augustus. In the Æneid there is a magnificent description of the descent and entrance into Hell; and the diseases, cares, and terrors that Æneas sees in his journey, are very happily imagin'd, as an introduction into the regions of Death: whereas in Homer there is nothing so noble, we scarce are able to discover the place where the Poet lays his scene, or whether Ulysses continues below or above the ground. Instead of a descent into hell, it seems rather a conjuring up, or an evocation of the dead from hell; according to the words of Horace, who undoubtedly had this passage of Homer in his thoughts. Satyr 8. lib. 1. ? Scalpere terram Unguibus, &amp; pullam divellere mordicus agnam Cœperunt; cruor in fossam confusus, ut inde Manes elicerent, animas responsa daturas. But if it be understood of an evocation only, how shall we account for several visions and descriptions in the conclusion of this book? Ulysses sees Tantalus in the waters of hell, and Sisyphus rowling a stone up an infernal mountain; these Ulysses could not conjure up, and consequently must be supposed to have enter'd at least the borders of those infernal regions. In short, Fraguier is of opinion, that Virgil profited more by the Frogs of Aristophanes than by Homer; and Mr. Dryden prefers the sixth book of the Æneid to the eleventh of the Odyssey, I think with very great reason. I will take this opportunity briefly to mention the original of all these fictions of infernal Rivers, Judges, &amp;c. spoken of by Homer, and repeated and enlarged by Virgil. They are of Ægyptian extract, as Mr. Sandys (that faithful traveller, and judicious Poet) observes, speaking of the Mummies of Memphis, p. 134. “These ceremonies perform'd, they laid the corps in a boat to be wafted over Acherusia, a lake on the south of Memphis, by one only person, whom they call'd Charon; which gave Orpheus the invention of his infernal ferriman; an ill-favour'd slovenly fellow, as Virgil describes him, Æneid 6. About this lake stood the shady temple of Hecate, with the ports of Cocytus and Oblivion, separated by bars of brass, the original of like fables. When landed on the other side, the bodies were brought before certain Judges; if convinc'd of an evil life, they were depriv'd of burial; if otherwise they suffer'd them to be interr'd.” This explication shews the foundation of those antient fables of Charon, Rhadamanthus, &amp; c. And also that the Poets had a regard to truth in their inventions, and grounded even their fables upon some remarkable customs, which grew obscure and absurd only because the memory of the customs to which they allude is lost to posterity. I will only add from Dacier, that this book is an evidence of the antiquity of the opinion of the Soul's Immortality. It is upon this that the most antient of all divinations was founded, I mean that which was performed by the evocation of the dead. There is a very remarkable instance of this in the holy Scriptures, in an age not very distant from that of Homer. Saul consults one of these infernal agents to call up Samuel, who appears, or some evil spirit in his form, and predicts his impending death and calamities. This is a pregnant instance of the antiquity of Necromancy, and that it was not of Homer's invention; it prevail'd long before his days among the Chaldeans, and spread over all the oriental world. Æschylus has a Tragedy intitled Persæ, in which the shade of Davius is call'd up, like that of Samuel, and fortells Queen Atossa all her misfortunes. Thus it appears that there was a foundation for what Homer writes; he only embellishes the opinions of Antiquity with the ornaments of Poetry. I must confess that Homer gives a miserable account of a future state; there is not a person describ'd in happiness, unless perhaps it be Tiresias: the good and the bad seem all in the same condition: Whereas Virgil has an Hell for the wicked, and an Elysium for the just. Tho' perhaps it may be a vindication of Homer to say, that the notions of Virgil of a future state were different from these of Homer; according to whom Hell might only be a receptacle for the vehicles of the dead, and that while they were in Hell, their ???? or Spirit might be in Heaven, as appears from what is said of the ??????? of Hercules in this 11th book of the Odyssey. Now to the shores we bend, a mournful train, Climb the tall bark, and launch into the main: At once the mast we rear, at once unbind The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind: Then pale and pensive stand, with cares opprest, And solemn horror saddens every breast. A freshning breeze the Circe. Magic pow'r supply'd, While the wing'd vessel flew along the tyde: Our oars we shipp'd: all day the swelling fails Full from the guiding pilot catch'd the gales. Now sunk the Sun from his aerial height, And o'er the shaded billows rush'd the night: When lo! we reach'd old Ocean's utmost bounds, Where rocks controul his waves with ever-during mounds. There in a lonely land, and gloomy cells, It is the opinion of many Commentators, that Homer constantly in these voyages of Ulysses makes use of a fabulous Geography; but perhaps the contrary opinion in many places may be true: In this passage, Ulysses in the space of one day sails from the Island of Circe to the Cimmerians: Now it is very evident from Herodotus and Strabo, that they inhabited the regions near the Bosphorus, and consequently Ulysses could not sail thither in the compass of a day; and therefore, says Strabo, the Poet removes not only the Cimmerians, but their climate and darkness, from the northern Bosphorus into Campania in Italy. But that there really were a people in Italy named Cimmerians is evident from the testimony of many Authors. So Lycophron plainly understands this passage, and relates these adventures as performed in Italy. He recapitulates all the voyages of Ulysses, and mentioning the descent into Hell and the Cimmerians, he immediately describes the infernal rivers, and adds, (speaking of the Apennine) ?? ?? ?? ????? ?????, ??? ????? ????? ?????, ???? ????????? ???????? ?????. That is, “From whence all the rivers, and all the fountains flow thro' the regions of Italy.” And these lines of Tibullus, Cimmerion etiam obscuras accessit ad arces, Queis nunquam candente dies apparuit ortu, Sive supra terras Phæbus, seu curreret infra. are understood by all interpreters to denote the Italian Cimmerians: who dwelt near Baiæ and the lake Avernus; and therefore Homer may be imagin'd not entirely to follow a fabulous Geography. It is evident from Herodotus that these Cimmerians were antiently a powerful nation; for passing into Asia (says that Author in his Clio) they possess'd themselves of Sardis, in the time of Ardyes, the son of Gyges. If so, it is possible they might make several settlements in different parts of the world, and call those settlements by their original name, Cimmerians, and consequently there might be Italian, as well as Scythian Cimmerians. It must be allow'd, that this horrid region is well chosen for the descent into Hell: It is describ'd as a land of obscurity and horrors, and happily imagin'd to introduce a relation concerning the realms of death and darkness. The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells; The Sun ne'er views th'uncomfortable seats, When radiant he advances, or retreats: Unhappy race! whom endless night invades, Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in shades. The ship we moor on these obscure abodes; Dis-bark the sheep, an offering to the Gods; And hellward bending, o'er the beach descry The dolesome passage to th'infernal sky. The victims, vow'd to each Tartarean pow'r, Eurylochus and Perimedes bore. Here open'd Hell, all Hell I here implor'd, And from the scabbard drew the shining sword; And trenching the black earth on ev'ry side, A cavern form'd, a cubit long and wide. New wine, with honey-temper'd milk, we bring, The word in the original is, ??????????, which (as Eustathius observes) the Antients constantly understood to imply a mixture of honey and milk; but all writers who succeeded Homer as constantly used it to signify a composition of water mix'd with honey. The Latin Poets have borrow'd their magical rites from Homer: Thus Ovid Metam, 7. 243. Haud procul egestâ scrobibus tellure duabus Sacra facit: cultrosque in guttura velleris atri Conjicit; &amp; patulas perfundit sanguine fossas, Tum super invergens liquidi carchesia Bacchi, Æneaque invergens tepidi carchesia lactis, &amp;c. Thus also Statius: ? Tellure cavatâ Inclinat Bacchi latices, &amp; munera verni, Lactis, &amp; Actæos imbres, &amp;c. This libation is made to all the departed shades; but to what purpose (objects Eustathius) should these rites be paid to the dead, when it is evident from the subsequent relation that they were ignorant of these ceremonies 'till they had tasted the libation? He answers from the Antients, that they were merely honorary to the regents of the dead, Pluto and Proserpina; and used to obtain their leave to have an interview with the shades in their dominions. Then living waters from the crystal spring; O'er these was strow'd the consecrated flour, And on the surface shone the holy store. Now the wan shades we hail, th'infernal Gods, To speed our course, and waft us o'er the floods; So shall a barren heifer from the stall Beneath the knife upon your altars fall; So in our palace, at our safe return Rich with unnumber'd gifts the Pyle shall burn; So shall a Ram, the largest of the breed, Black as these regions, to Tiresias bleed. Thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid To all the Phantom nations of the dead. Then dy'd the sheep; a purple torrent flow'd, And all the cavern smok'd with streaming blood. When lo! appear'd along the dusky coasts, We are inform'd by Eustathius, that the Antients rejected these six verses; for say they, these are not the shades of persons newly slain, but who have long been in these infernal regions: How then can their wounds be suppos'd still to be visible, especially through their armour, when the soul was separated from the body? Neither is this the proper place for their appearance, for the Poet immediately subjoins, that the ghost of Elpenor was the first that he encounter'd in these regions of darkness. But these objections will be easily answer'd by having recourse to the notions which the Antients entertained concerning the dead: we must remember that they imagin'd that the soul tho' freed from the body had still a vehicle, exactly resembling the body; as the figure in a mold retains the resemblance of the mold, when separated from it; the body is but as a case to this vehicle, and it is in this vehicle that the wounds are said to be visible; this was supposed to be less gross than the mortal body, and less subtile than the Soul; so that whatever wounds the outward body receiv'd when living, were believ'd to affect this inward Substance, and consequently might be visible after separation. It is true that the Poet calls the ghost of Elpenor the first ghost, but this means the first whom he knew: Elpenor was not yet buried, and therefore was not yet received into the habitation of the dead, but wanders before the entrance of it. This is the reason why his shade is said to present it self the foremost; it comes not up from the realm of death, but descends towards it from the upper world. But these shades of the warriors are said still to wear their armour in which they were slain, for the Poet adds that it was stain'd with blood: How is it possible for these ghosts, which are only a subtle substance, not a gross body, to wear the armour they wore in the other world? How was it convey'd to them in these infernal regions? All that occurs to me in answer to this objection is, that the Poet describes them suitably to the characters they bore in life; the warriors on earth are warriors in Hell; and that he adds these circumstances only to denote the manner of their death, which was in battle, or by the sword. No doubt but Homer represents a future state according to the notions which his age entertain'd of it, and this sufficiently justifies him as a Poet, who is not obliged to write truths, but according to fame and common opinions. But to prove these verses genuine, we have the authority of Virgil: he was too sensible of their beauty not to adorn his Poems with them. Georg. 4. 470. At cantu commotæ Erebi de sedibus imis Umbræ ibant tenues, simulacraque luce carentum, Matres, atque viri, defunctaque corpora vitâ Magnanimum heroum, pueri, innuptæque puellæ, Impositique rogis juvenes, &amp;c. It must be confessed that this Roman Poet omits the circumstance of the armour in his translation, as being perhaps contrary to the opinions prevailing in his age; but in the sixth book he describes his Heroes with arms, horses, and infernal chariots; and in the story of Deiphobus we see his shade retain the wounds in Hell, which he received at the time of his death in Troy. ? Lacerum crudeliter ora Deiphobum vidi, &amp;c. Thin, airy shoals of visionary ghosts; Fair, pensive youths, and soft-enamour'd maids, And wither'd Elders, pale and wrinkled shades: Ghastly with wounds the forms of warriors slain Stalk'd with majestic port, a martial train: These, and a thousand more swarm'd o'er the ground, And all the dire assembly shriek'd around. Astonish'd at the sight, aghast I stood, And a cold fear ran shivering thro' my blood; Strait I command the sacrifice to haste, Strait the flea'd victims to the flames are cast, And mutter'd vows, and mystic song apply'd To grisly Pluto, and his gloomy bride. Now swift I wav'd my faulchion o'er the blood; Back started the pale throngs, and trembling stood. Round the black trench the gore untasted flows, 'Till awful, from the shades Tiresias rose. There, wand'ring thro' the gloom I first survey'd, New to the realms of death, Elpenor's shade: His cold remains all naked to the sky On distant shores unwept, unburied lie. Sad at the sight I stand, deep fix'd in woe, And ere I spoke the tears began to flow. O say what angry pow'r Elpenor led To glide in shades, and wander with the dead? How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoyn'd, Eustathius is of opinion, that Ulysses speaks pleasantly to Elpenor, for were his words to be literally translated they would be, Elpenor, thou art come hither on foot, sooner than I in a ship. I suppose it is the worthless character of Elpenor that led that Critic into this opinion; but I should rather take the sentence to be spoken seriously, not only because such railleries are an insult upon the unfortunate, and levities perhaps unworthy of Epic Poetry, but also from the general conduct of Ulysses, who at the sight of Elpenor bursts into tears, and compassionates the fate of his friend. Is there any thing in this that looks like raillery? if there be, we must confess that Ulysses makes a very quick transition from sorrow to pleasantry. The other is a more noble sense, and therefore I have follow'd it, and it excellently paints the surprize of Ulysses at the unexpected sight of Elpenor, and expresses his wonder that the Soul, the moment it leaves the body, should reach the receptacle of departed shades. But it may be ask'd what connection this story of Elpenor has to the subject of the Poem, and what it contributes to the end of it? Bossu very well answers that the Poet may insert some incidents that make no part of the fable or action; especially if they be short, and break not the thread of it: this before us is only a small part of a large Episode, which the Poet was at liberty to insert or omit, as contributed most to the beauty of his Poetry: besides, it contains an excellent moral, and shews us the ill effects of drunkenness and debauchery. The Poet represents Elpenor as a person of a mean character, and punishes his crime with sudden death, and dishonour. I will only add that Virgil treads in the footsteps of Homer, and Misenus in the Æneid, is the Elpenor of the Odyssey: There is indeed some difference; Misenus suffers for his presumption, Elpenor for his debauchery. Out-fly the nimble sail, and leave the lagging wind? The Ghost reply'd: To Hell my doom I owe, The words in the original are, ??? ?? ???????? ????. The identity of sound in ??? and ???? may perhaps appear a little inharmonious, and shock the ear. It is a known observation that the nice ears in the Court of Augustus could not pardon Virgil for a like similitude of cadence in this verse. At regina Pyrâ? But these are rather negligences than errors; they are indeed to be avoided, but a great genius sometimes overlooks such niceties, and sacrifices sound to sense. The words of Quintilian are very apposite to this purpose, lib. 8. cap. 3. Ejusdem verbi aut sermonis iteratio, quanquam non magnopere summis authoribus vitata, interim vitium videri potest; in quod sæpe incidit etiam Cicero, securus tam parvæ observationis. He brings an instance of it from his oration for Cluentius, Non solum igitur illud judicium, judicii simile, indices, non fuit. It must be confess'd, that the sense is not only darken'd, but the ear shock'd at the repetition of the same word in the same period. This is a very pregnant instance, that the opinion of an evil Dæmon or Genius prevail'd in the days of Homer: but this excuse of Elpenor, in ascribing his calamity to a Dæmon, gives great offence to Maximus Tyrius, he being a Stoic Philosopher. He says Elpenor is guilty of falshood in this excuse to Ulysses; for Dæmons, parcæ, &amp;c. are nothing but the idle pretext of wicked men, who are industrious to transfer their own follies to the Gods, according to those Verses in the beginning of the Odyssey. Why charge mankind on heav'n their own offence, And call their woes the crime of providence? Blind! who themselves their miseries create, And perish by their folly, not their fate. Dæmons accurst, dire ministers of woe! My feet thro' wine unfaithful to their weight, Betray'd me tumbling from a tow'ry height. Stagg'ring I reel'd, and as I reel'd I fell. Lux'd the neck joynt—my soul descends to hell. But lend me aid, I now conjure thee lend, By the soft tye and sacred name of friend! By thy fond consort! by thy father's cares! By lov'd Telemachus his blooming years! For well I know that soon the heav'nly pow'rs Will give thee back to day, and Circe's shores: There pious on my cold remains attend, There call to mind thy poor departed friend. The tribute of a tear is all I crave, And the possession of a peaceful grave. But if unheard, in vain compassion plead, Revere the Gods, the Gods avenge the dead! A tomb along the wat'ry margin raise, The tomb with manly arms and trophies grace, To shew posterity Elpenor was. There high in air, memorial of my name Fix the smooth oar, and bid me live to fame. To whom with tears; These rites, oh mournful shade, Due to thy Ghost, shall to thy Ghost be paid. Still as I spoke, the Phantom seem'd to moan, Tear follow'd tear, and groan succeeded groan. But as my waving sword the blood surrounds, The shade withdrew, and mutter'd empty sounds. There as the wond'rous visions I survey'd, All pale ascends my royal mother's shade: The behaviour of Ulysses with respect to his mother may appear not sufficiently tender and affectionate; he refrains all manner of address to her, a conduct which may be censur'd as inconsistent with filial piety; but Plutarch very fully answers this objection. “It is (says that Author) a remarkable instance of the prudence of Ulysses, who descending into the regions of the dead, refused all conference even with his mother, 'till he had obtain'd an answer from Tiresias, concerning the business which induc'd him to undertake that infernal journey.” A wise man is not inquisitive about things impertinent; accordingly Ulysses first shews himself a wise man, and then a dutiful son. Besides, it is very judicious in Homer thus to describe Ulysses: the whole design of the Odyssey is the return of Ulysses to his Country; this is the mark at which the Heroe should continually aim, and therefore it is necessary that all other incidents should be subordinate to this; and the Poet had been blameable if he had shew'd Ulysses entertaining himself with amusements, and postponing the considerations of the chief design of the Odyssey. Lucian speaks to the same purpose in his piece upon Astrology. A Queen, to Troy she saw our legions pass; Now a thin form is all Anticlea was! Struck at the sight I melt with filial woe, And down my cheek the pious sorrows flow, Yet as I shook my faulchion o'er the blood, Regardless of her son the Parent stood. When lo! the mighty Theban I behold; To guide his steps he bore a staff of gold; Awful he trod! majestic was his look! And from his holy lips these accents broke. Why, mortal, wand'rest thou from chearful day, To tread the downward, melancholy way? What angry Gods to these dark regions led Thee yet alive, companion of the dead? But sheath thy ponyard, while my tongue relates The terror which the shades of the departed express at the sight of the sword of Ulysses has been frequently censur'd as absurd and ridiculous: Risum cui non moveat, says Scaliger, cum ensem ait &amp; vulnera metuisse? What have the dead to fear from a sword, who are beyond the power of it, by being reduc'd to an incorporeal shadow? But this description is consistent with the notions of the Antients concerning the dead. I have already remark'd, that the shades retain'd a vehicle, which resembled the body, and was liable to pain as well as the corporeal substance; if not, to what purpose are the Furies describ'd with iron scourges, or the Vultur tearing the liver of Tityus? Virgil ascribes the like fears to the shades in the Æneas; for the Sibyl thus commands Æneas, Tuque invade viam, vaginâque eripe ferrum. And the shades of the Greeks are there said to fly at the sight of his arms. At Danaûm proceres, Agamemnoniæque Phalanges Ut vidêre virum, fulgentiaque arma per umbras Ingenti trepidare metu. Tiresias is here describ'd consistently with the character before given him by the Poet, I mean with a preheminence above the other shades; for (as Eustathius observes, he knows Ulysses before he tastes the ingredients; a privilege not claim'd by any other of the infernal inhabitants. Elpenor indeed did the same, but for another reason: because he was not yet buried, nor enter'd the regions of the dead, and therefore his Soul was yet intire. Heav'n's stedfast purpose, and thy future fates. While yet he spoke, the Prophet I obey'd, And in the scabbard plung'd the glitt'ring blade: Eager he quaff'd the gore, and then exprest Dark things to come, the counsels of his breast. Weary of light, Ulysses here explores, A prosp'rous voyage to his native shores; But know—by me unerring Fates disclose New trains of dangers, and new scenes of woes, I see! I see, thy bark by Neptune tost, For injur'd Cyclops, and his eyeball lost! Yet to thy woes the Gods decree an end, If heav'n thou please; and how to please attend! Where on Trinacrian rocks the Ocean roars, Graze num'rous herds along the verdant shores; Tho' hunger press, yet fly the dang'rous prey, The herds are sacred to the God of day, Who all surveys with his extensive eye Above, below, on earth and in the sky! Rob not the God, and so propitious gales Attend thy voyage, and impel thy sails: But if his herds ye seize, beneath the waves I see thy friends o'erwhelm'd in liquid graves! The direful wreck Ulysses scarce survives! Ulysses at his country scarce arrives! The Poet conducts this interview with admirable judgment. The whole design of Ulysses is to engage the Phæacians in his favour, in order to his transportation to his own country: How does he bring this about? By shewing that it was decreed by the Gods that he should be conducted thither by strangers; so that the Phæacians immediately conclude, that they are the people destin'd by Heaven to conduct him home; to give this the greater weight, he puts the speech into the mouth of the Prophet Tiresias, and exalts his character in an extraordinary manner, to strengthen the credit of the prediction: By this method likewise the Poet interweaves his Episode into the texture and essence of the Poem, he makes this journey into Hell contribute to the restoration of his Heroe, and unites the subordinate parts very happily with the main action. Strangers thy guides! nor there thy labours end, New foes arise, domestick ills attend! There foul adult'rers to thy bride resort, And lordly gluttons riot in thy court. But vengeance hastes amain! These eyes behold The deathful scene, Princes on Princes roll'd! That done, a people far from Sea explore, It is certain that Tiresias speaks very obscurely, after the manner of the Oracles; but the Antients generally understood this people to be the Epirots. Thus Pausanias in his Attics. ?? ???? ??????? ????? ????????, ???? ????? ????????? ???????, ???????? ?? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ????????. ? ?? ??? ????? ????????. That is; “The Epirots even so lately as after the taking of Troy, were ignorant of the sea, and the use of salt, as Homer testifies in his Odyssey: Who ne'er knew salt, nor heard the billows roar. So that they who were ignorant of the sea, were likewise ignorant of the use of salt, according to Homer: whence it may be conjectur'd, that the Poet knew of no salt but what was made of sea-water. The other token of their ignorance of the sea was, that they should not know an Oar, but call it a Corn-van. This verse was once sarcastically apply'd to Philip of Macedon, by Amerdion a Grecian, who flying from him and being apprehended, was ask'd whither he fled? he bravely answer'd, to find a people who knew not Philip. ?????? ???? ????????, ?? ??? ????? ????????. I persuade my self that this passage is rightly translated: ???? ??????????????, and ?? ?? ????? ????? ????????. A painted wonder, flying on the main. for the wings of the ship signify the sails, [as Eustathius remarks) and not the oars, as we might be misled to conclude from the immediate connection with ??????, or oars. The Poet, I believe, intended to express the wonder of a person upon his first sight of a ship, who observing it to move swiftly along the seas, might mistake the sails for wings, according to that beautiful description of Mr. Dryden upon a like occasion in his Indian Emperor. The objects I could first distinctly view, Were tall streight trees which on the waters flew; Wings on their sides instead of leaves did grow, Which gather'd all the breath the winds could blow: And at their roots grew floating Palaces, &amp;c. Eustathius tells us the reason of this command given to Ulysses, to search out a people ignorant of the sea: It was in honour of Neptune, to make his name regarded by a nation which was entirely a stranger to that Deity; and this injunction was laid by way of atonement for the violence offer'd to his son Polyphemus. Many Critics have imagin'd that this passage is corrupted; but, as Eustathius observes, we have the Authority of Sophocles to prove it genuine, who alluding to this passage, writes, ????? ??????????? ??????? ?????. Who ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar, Or saw gay vessel stem the wat'ry plain, A painted wonder flying on the main! Bear on thy back an Oar: with strange amaze A shepherd meeting thee, the Oar surveys, And names a Van: there fix it on the plain, To calm the God that holds the wat'ry reign; A threefold off'ring to his Altar bring, A bull, a ram, a boar; and hail the Ocean-King. But home return'd, to each ætherial pow'r Slay the due Victim in the genial hour: So peaceful shalt thou end thy blissful days, And steal thy self from life, by slow decays: Unknown to pain, in age resign thy breath, When late stern Neptune points the shaft with death; The Death of Ulysses is related variously, but the following account is chiefly credited: Ulysses had a son by Circe named Telegonus, who being grown to years of maturity, sail'd to Ithaca in search of his father; where seizing some sheep for the use of his attendants, the shepherds put themselves into a posture to rescue them; Ulysses being advertis'd of it, went with his son Telemachus to repel Telegonus, who in defending himself wounded Ulysses, not knowing him to be his father. Thus Oppian, Hyginus, and Dictys relate the story. Many Poets have brought this upon the stage, and Aristotle criticizing upon one of these Tragedies gives us the title of it, which was, Ulysses wounded. But if Ulysses thus dy'd, how can Neptune be said to point the shaft with death? We are inform'd that the spear with which Telegonus gave the wound, was pointed with the bone of a sea Turtle; so that literally his death came from the sea, or ?? ????: and Neptune being the God of the Ocean, his death may without violence be ascrib'd to that Deity. It is true, some Critics read ??????, as one word, and then it will signify that Ulysses should escape the dangers of the sea, and die upon the continent far from it; but the former sense is most consonant to the tenor of the Poem, thro' which Neptune is constantly represented as an enemy to Ulysses. I will only add the reason why Ulysses is enjoyn'd to offer a Bull, a Ram, and a Boar to Neptune: the Bull represents the roaring of the sea in storms; the Ram the milder appearance of it when in tranquility: the Boar was used by the Antients as an emblem of fecundity, to represent the fruitfulness of the Ocean. This particular sacrifice of three animals was call'd ???????. Eustathius. To the dark grave retiring as to rest, Thy people blessing, by thy people blest! Unerring truths, oh man, my lips relate; This is thy life to come, and this is fate. To whom unmov'd; If this the Gods prepare, What heav'n ordains the wise with courage bear. But say, why yonder on the lonely strands, Unmindful of her son, Anticlea stands? Why to the ground she bends her downcast eye? Why is she silent, while her son is nigh? The latent cause, oh sacred Seer, reveal! Nor this, replies the Seer, will I conceal. Know; to the spectres, that thy bev'rage taste, The scenes of life recur, and actions past; They, seal'd with truth return the sure reply, The rest repell'd, a train oblivious fly. The phantom Prophet ceas'd, and sunk from sight To the black palace of eternal Night. Still in the dark abodes of death I stood, When near Anticlea mov'd, and drank the blood. Strait all the mother in her soul awakes, And owning her Ulysses, thus she speaks. Com'st thou, my son, alive, to realms beneath, The dolesom realms of darkness and of death: Com'st thou alive from pure, ætherial day? Dire is the region, dismal is the way! Here lakes profound, there floods oppose their waves, There the wide sea with all his billows raves! If this passage were literally translated, it would run thus: My son, how didst thou arrive at this place of darkness, when so many rivers, and the Ocean lie in the midway? This (says Eustathius) plainly shews that Homer uses a fabulous Geography; for whereas the places that are mention'd in these voyages of Ulysses are really situated upon the Mediterranean, Anticlea here says that they lie in the middle of the Ocean. But this is undoubtedly an error: The whole of the observation depends upon the word ?????; But why must this denote the midway so exactly? Is it not sufficient to say, that between Ithaca and this infernal region, rivers and the Ocean roul? And that this is the real meaning is evident from this book, for Ulysses sails in the space of one day from the Island of Circe to the place where he descends: How then could these places where Ulysses touches in his voyage lie in the middle of the Ocean, unless we can suppose he pass'd half the Ocean in one day? The Poet directly affirms, that he descends at the extremity of it; but this extremity is no more than one day's voyage from the Island of Circe, and consequently that Island could not lie in the middle of the Ocean: Therefore this place is no evidence that Homer uses a fabulous Geography. Eustathius very justly observes, that Homer judiciously places the descent into Hell at the extremity of the Ocean: for it is natural to imagine, that to be the only passage to it, by which the Sun and the Stars themselves appear to descend, and sink into the realms of darkness. Or (since to dust proud Troy submits her tow'rs) Com'st thou a wand'rer from the Phrygian shores? Or say, since honour call'd thee to the field, Hast thou thy Ithaca, thy bride, beheld? Source of my life, I cry'd, from earth I fly To seek Tiresias in the nether sky, To learn my doom: for tost from woe to woe, In every land Ulysses finds a foe: Nor have these eyes beheld my native shores, Since in the dust proud Troy submits her tow'rs. But, when thy soul from her sweet mansion fled, Say what distemper gave thee to the dead? Has life's fair lamp declin'd by slow decays, Or swift expir'd it, in a sudden blaze? Say if my sire, good old Laertes, lives? If yet Telemachus, my son, survives? Say by his rule is my dominion aw'd, Or crush'd by traytors with an iron rod? Say if my spouse maintains her royal trust, Tho' tempted chaste, and obstinately just? Or if no more her absent Lord she wails, But the false woman o'er the wife prevails. Thus I, and thus the parent shade returns. The questions which Ulysses asks (remarks Eustathius) could not fail of having a very good effect upon his Phæacian audience: By them he very artfully (and as it seems undeably) lets them into the knowledge of his dignity, and shews the importance of his person; to induce them to a greater care to conduct him to his country. The process of the whole story is so artfully carried on, that Ulysses seems only to relate an accidental interview, while he tacitly recommends himself, and lets them know the person who asks their assistance is a King. It is observable that Anticlea inverts the order in her answer, and replies last to the first question. Orators always reserve the strongest argument for the conclusion, to leave it fresh upon the memory of their auditors: or rather, the Poet uses this method to introduce the sorrow of Ulysses for the death of his mother more naturally: He steals away the mind of the Reader from attending the main action, to enliven it with a scene of tenderness and affection in these regions of horror. Thee, ever thee, thy faithful consort mourns; Whether the night descends, or day prevails, Thee she by night, and thee by day bewails, Thee in Telemachus thy realm obeys; In sacred groves celestial rites he pays, And shares the banquet in superior state, This passage is fully explain'd by Eustathius: he tells us, that it was an antient custom to invite Kings and Legislators to all public feasts; this was to do them honour: and the chief seat was always reserved for the chief Magistrate. Without this observation, the lines are unintelligible. It is evident that the words are not spoken of sacrifices or feasts made to the Gods, but social entertainments, for they are general, ?????? ????????, “all the people of the realm invite Telemachus to their feasts;” And this seems to have been a right due to the chief Magistrate, for ????????? implies it, which word Eustathius explains by ?? ???? ?????????; “such an honour as ought not to be neglected,” or Grac'd with such honours as become the Great. It gives a very happy image of these ages of the world, when we observe such an intercourse between the King and the subject: The Idea of power carries no terror in it, but the ruler himself makes a part of the public Joy. Grac'd with such honours as become the Great. Thy sire in solitude foments his care: The court is joyless, for thou art not there! No costly carpets raise his hoary head, No rich embroid'ry shines to grace his bed: Ev'n when keen winter freezes in the skies, Rank'd with his slaves, on earth the Monarch lies: Deep are his sighs, his visage pale, his dress The garb of woe and habit of distress. And when the Autumn takes his annual round, The leafy honours scatt'ring on the ground; Regardless of his years, abroad he lies, His bed the leaves, his canopy the skies. Thus cares on cares his painful days consume, And bow his age with sorrow to the tomb! For thee, my son, I wept my life away; For thee thro' hell's eternal dungeons stray: Nor came my fate by ling'ring pains and slow, Nor bent the silver-shafted Queen her bow; No dire disease bereav'd me of my breath; Thou, thou my son wert my disease and death; Unkindly with my love my son conspir'd, For thee I liv'd, for absent thee expir'd. Thrice in my arms I strove her shade to bind, This passage plainly shews that the vehicles of the departed were believ'd by the Antients to be of an aerial substance, and retain nothing of corporeal grossness. Virgil has borrow'd these verses. Ter conatus ibi collo dare brachia circum; Ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago, Par levibus ventis, volucrique simillima somno. Scaliger gives the preference to the Roman Poet, becauses he uses three verses, at a time when the word ter occurs in the description, whereas Homer concludes in little more than two lines. But this is not criticizing, but trifling; and ascribing to an Author what the Author himself had no thought of. This puts me in mind of a story in Lucian, where a person of a strong imagination thinking there was a mystery in ?????, the first word in the Iliad, is introduc'd enquiring of Homer in the regions of the dead, why he plac'd it in the beginning of his Poem? he answers, Because it first came into his head. I doubt not but the number of the lines in this place in both Poets was equally accidental; Virgil adds nothing to the thought of Homer, tho' he uses more words. Thrice thro' my arms she slipt like empty wind, Or dreams, the vain illusions of the mind. Wild with despair, I shed a copious tide Of flowing tears, and thus with sighs reply'd. Fly'st thou, lov'd shade, while I thus fondly mourn? Turn to my arms, to my embraces turn! Is it, ye pow'rs that smile at human harms! Too great a bliss to weep within her arms? This is almost a literal translation; the words in the Greek are, ???????????? ?????, or, that we may delight our selves with sorrow, which Eustathius explains by saying, there is a pleasure in weeping: I should rather understand the words to signify, that in the instant while he is rejoicing at the sight of his mother, he is compell'd to turn his joy into tears, to find the whole scene a delusion. Or has hell's Queen an empty Image sent, That wretched I might ev'n my joys lament? O son of woe, the pensive shade rejoin'd, Oh most inur'd to grief of all mankind! 'Tis not the Queen of Hell who thee deceives: All, all are such, when life the body leaves; No more the substance of the man remains, Nor bounds the blood along the purple veins; These the funereal flames in atoms bear, To wander with the wind in empty air, While the impassive soul reluctant flies Like a vain dream to these infernal skies. But from the dark dominions speed thy way, And climb the steep ascent to upper day; To thy chaste bride the wond'rous story tell, The woes, the horrors, and the laws of Hell. Thus whiles he spoke, in swarms hell's Empress brings Daughters and wives of Heroes and of Kings; Thick, and more thick they gather round the blood, Ghost throng'd on ghost (a dire assembly) stood! Dauntless my sword I seize: the airy crew, Swift as it flash'd along the gloom, withdrew; Then shade to shade in mutual forms succeeds, Nothing can better shew the invention of Homer, than his capacity of furnishing out a scene of such great variety in this infernal region: He calls up the Heroes of former ages from a state of inexistence to adorn and diversify his Poetry. If it be ask'd what relation this journey into hell has to the main action of the Odyssey? the answer is, It has an Episodic affinity with it, and shews the sufferings of Ulysses more than any of his voyages upon the Ocean, as it is more horrible and full of terrors. What a treasury of antient History and fables has he opened by this descent? he lets us into a variety of different characters of the most famous personages recorded in antient story; and at the same time lays before us a supplement to the Iliad. If Virgil paid a happy piece of flattery to the Romans, by introducing the greatest persons of the best families in Rome, in his descent in the Æneid; Homer no less happily interests the Grecians in his story, by honouring the Ancestors of the noblest families who still flourish'd in Greece, in the Odyssey; a circumstance that could not fail of being very acceptable to a Grecian or Roman Reader, but perhaps less entertaining to us, who have no particular interest in these stories. Her race recounts, and their illustrious deeds. Tyro began: whom great Salmoneus bred; Virgil gives a very different character of Salmoneus from this of Homer: he describes him as an impious person who presum'd to imitate the thunder of Jupiter, whereas Homer stiles him blameless, or ??????; an argument, says Eustathius, that the preceding story is a fable invented since the days of Homer. This may perhaps be true, and we may naturally conclude it to be true from his silence of it, but not from the epithet ??????; for in the first book of the Odyssey, Jupiter gives the same appellation to Ægysthus, even while he condemns him of murder and adultery. Eustathius adds, that Salmoneus was a great proficient in Mechanics, and inventor of a vessel call'd ?????????, which imitated thunder by rouling stones in it, which gave occasion to the fictions of the Poets. The royal partner of fam'd Cretheus' bed. For fair Enipeus, as from fruitful urns There are no fables in the Poets that seem more bold than these concerning the commerce between women, and river Gods; but Eustathius gives us a probable solution: I will translate him literally. It was customary for young Virgins to resort frequently to rivers to bathe in them; and the Antients have very well explain'd these fables about the intercourse between them and the water Gods: Receive my Virginity O Scamander! says a Lady; but it is very apparent who this Scamander was: Her lover Cimon lay conceal'd in the reeds. This was a good excuse for female frailty, in ages of credulity: for such imaginary intercourse between the fair Sex and Deities was not only believ'd, but esteem'd honourable. No doubt the Ladies were frequently deceiv'd; their lovers personated the Deities, and they took a Cimon to their arms in the disguise of a Scamander. It is uncertain where this Enipeus flows: Strabo (says Eustathius) imagines it to be a river of Peloponnesus, that disembogues its waters into the Alphæus; for the Thessalian river is Eniseus, and not Enipeus: This rises from mount Othrys, and receives into it the Epidanus. The former seems to be the river intended by Homer, for it takes its source from a village call'd Salmone; and what strengthens this conjecture is the neighbourhood of the Ocean (or Neptune in this fable) to that river. Lucian has made this story of Enipeus the subject of one of his Dialogues. He pours his wat'ry store, the Virgin burns; Smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride, And in soft mazes rouls a silver Tide: As on his banks the maid enamour'd roves, The Monarch of the deep beholds and loves; In her Enipeus' form and borrow'd charms, The am'rous God descends into her arms: Around, a spacious arch of waves he throws, And high in air the liquid mountain rose; Thus in surrounding floods conceal'd he proves The pleasing transport, and compleats his loves. Then softly sighing, he the fair addrest, And as he spoke her tender hand he prest. Hail happy nymph! no vulgar births are ow'd To the prolific raptures of a God: Lo! when nine times the moon renews her horn, Two brother heroes shall from thee be born; Thy early care the future worthies claim, To point them to the arduous paths of fame; But in thy breast th'important truth conceal, Nor dare the secret of a God reveal: For know, thou Neptune view'st! and at my nod Earth trembles, and the waves confess their God. He added not, but mountain spurn'd the plain, Then plung'd into the chambers of the main. Now in the time's full process forth she brings Jove's dread vicegerents, in two future Kings; O'er proud Iolcos Pelias stretch'd his reign, And god-like Neleus rul'd the Pylian plain: Then fruitful, to her Cretheus' royal bed She gallant Pheres and fam'd Æson bred: From the same fountain Amytheon rose, Pleas'd with the din of war, and noble shout of foes. There mov'd Antiope with haughty charms, Who blest th'Almighty Thund'rer in her arms; Hence sprung Amphion, hence brave Zethus came, The fable of Thebes built by the power of Music is not mention'd by Homer, and therefore may be supposed to be of later invention. Homer relates many circumstances in these short histories differently from his successors; Epicaste is call'd Jocasta, and the Tragedians have entirely varied the story of Oedipus: They tell us he tore out his eyes, that he was driven from Thebes, and being conducted by his daughter Antigone, arriv'd at Athens, where entring the Temple of the Furies, he dy'd in the midst of a furious storm, and was carried by it into Hell: Whereas Homer directly affirms, that he continued to reign in Thebes after all his calamities. It is not easy to give a reason why the mother, and not the father, is said to send the Furies to torment Oedipus, especially because he was the murderer of his father Laius: Eustathius answers, that it was by accident that he slew Laius; but upon the discovery of his wickedness in marrying his mother Jocasta, he used her with more barbarity and rigour than was necessary, and therefore she pursues him with her vengeance. Jocasta and Dido both die after the same manner by their own hands: I agree with Scaliger, that Virgil has describ'd hanging more happily than Homer. Informis Lethi nodum trabe nectit ab altâ. ????????? ?????? ????? ??? ??????? ????????. There is nothing like the Informis Lethi nodus in Homer: and as that Critic observes, tam atrox res atiquo verborum ambitu studiosius comprehenda fuit. The story of Oedipus is this: Laius being informed by the Oracle, that he should be slain by his son, caus'd Oedipus immediately to be exposed by his shepherds to wild beasts; but the shepherds preserv'd him, and gave him education: When he came to years of maturity he went toward Thebes in search of his father, but meeting Laius by the way, and a quarrel arising, he slew him ignorantly, and married Jocasta his mother; This is the subject of two Tragedies in Sophocles. Founders of Thebes, and men of mighty name; Tho' bold in open field, they yet surround The town with walls, and mound inject on mound; Here ramparts stood, there tow'rs rose high in air, And here thro' sev'n wide portals rush'd the war. There with soft step the fair Alcmena trod, Who bore Alcides to the thund'ring God; And Megara, who charm'd the son of Jove, And soften'd his stern soul to tender love. Sullen and sow'r with discontented mien Jocasta frown'd, th'incestuous Theban Queen; With her own Son she join'd in nuptial bands, Tho' father's blood imbru'd his murd'rous hands: The Gods and men the dire offence detest, The Gods with all their furies rend his breast: In lofty Thebes he wore th'imperial crown, A pompous wretch! accurs'd upon a throne. The wife self-murder'd from a beam depends, And her foul soul to blackest Hell descends; Thence to her son the choicest plagues she brings, And the fiends haunt him with a thousand stings. And now the beauteous Chloris I descry, A Critic ought not only to endeavour to point out the beauties in the sense, but also in the versification of a Poet: Dionysius Halicarn. cites these two verses as peculiarly flowing and harmonious. ??? ?????? ????? ??????????, ??? ???? ??????. ????? ??? ??? ??????, ???? ???? ????? ????. There is not one elision, nor one rough vowel or consonant, but they flow along with the utmost smoothness, and the beauty of the Muse equals that of Chloris. A lovely shade, Amphion's youngest joy! With gifts unnumber'd Neleus sought her arms, Nor paid too dearly for unequal'd charms; Great in Orchomenos, in Pylos great, This is a very considerable city lying between Bœotia and Phocis, upon the river Cephisus: Homer calls it the Minyan Orchomenos, because the Minyans and antient people inhabited it; it was the colony of these Mynyans that sail'd to Iolcos, and gave name to the Argonauts. Eustathius. He sway'd the scepter with imperial state. Three gallant sons the joyful monarch told, Sage Nestor, Periclimenus the bold, The reason why Homer gives this epithet to Periclimenus may be learn'd from Hesiod: Neptune gave him the Power to change himself into all shapes, but he was slain by Hercules: Periclimenus assaulted that Heroe in the shape of a bee, or fly, who discovering him in that disguise, by the means of Pallas slew him with his club. This is the person of whom Ovid speaks, but adds that he was slain in the shape of an eagle by Hercules. Mira Periclimeni mors est, cui posse figuras Sumere quas vellet, rursusque reponere sumptas, Neptunus dederat, &amp;c. Euphorion speaks of him in the shape of a bee or fly. ? ?????? ?? ???? ???????? ????? ???? ?????? ?????? ???? ? And Chromius last; but of the softer race, One nymph alone, a miracle of grace. Kings on their thrones for lovely Pero burn, The Sire denies, and Kings rejected mourn. To him alone the beauteous prize he yields, Whose arm should ravish from Phylacian fields The herds of Iphyclus, detain'd in wrong; Wild, furious herds, unconquerably strong! This dares a Seer, but nought the Seer prevails, This story is related with great obscurity, but we learn from the 15?? book that the name of this Prophet was Melampus. Iphyclus was the son of Deioneus, and Uncle to Tyro; he had seized upon the goods of Tyro the mother of Neleus, among which were many beautiful oxen: these Neleus demands, but is unjustly denied by Iphyclus: Neleus had a daughter named Pero, a great beauty who was courted by all the neighbouring Princes, but the father refuses her, unless to the man who recovers these oxen from Iphyclus: Bias was in love with Pero, and persuades his brother Melampus a Prophet to undertake the Recovery; he attempts it, but being vanquished, is thrown into prison; but at last set at liberty, for telling Iphyclus, who was childless, how to procure issue. Iphyclus upon this gave him the oxen for a reward. Nothing can be more ridiculous than the explanation of this story in Eustathius, which I will lay before the Reader for his entertainment. Melampus, after he was made a prisoner, was trusted to the care of a man and a woman; the man used him with mercy, and the woman with cruelty: One day he heard a low noise, and a family of worms in conference. (He understood the language of all the animal creation, beasts and reptiles) These worms were discoursing how they had eaten thro' a great beam that lay over the head of Melampus: He immediately provides for his own safety, feigns a sickness, and begs to be carried into the fresh air: The woman and the man immediately comply with his request; at which instant the beam falling, kills the woman: An account of this is forthwith carried to Iphyclus, who sending for Melampus, asks who he is? He tells him, a Prophet, and that he came for the Oxen of Neleus; Iphyclus commands him to declare how he may have an heir? Melampus kills an Ox, and calls all the birds of the air to feast on it; they all appear except the Vultur; he proposes the case to them, but they give no satisfactory answer; at last the Vultur appears, and gives Melampus a full information: Upon this Iphyclus obtains a child, and Melampus the Oxen of Neleus. In beauty's cause illustriously he fails: Twelve moons the foe the captive youth detains In painful dungeons, and coercive chains; The foe at last from durance where he lay, His art revering, gave him back to day; Won by prophetic knowledge, to fulfill The stedfast purpose of th'Almighty will. These words ???? ?? ????????? ?????, seems to come in without any connection with the story, and consequently unnecessarily; but Homer speaks of it concisely, as an adventure well known in his times, and therefore not wanting a further explication: But Apollodorus relates the whole at large, lib. 1. The reason why these words are inserted is, to inform us that there were antient Prophecies concerning Iphyclus, that it was decreed by Jupiter he should have no children 'till he had recourse to a Prophet, who explaining these Prophecies to him should shew him how to obtain that blessing: In this sense the will of Jupiter may be said to be fulfill'd. With graceful port advancing now I spy'd Leda the fair, the god-like Tyndar's bride: Hence Pollux sprung who wields with furious sway The deathful gauntlet, matchless in the fray; And Castor glorious on th'embattled plain Curbs the proud steed, reluctant to the rein: By turns they visit this ætherial sky, And live alternate, and alternate die: Castor and Pollux are call'd ??????????, or the sons of Jupiter; but what could give occasion to this fiction, of their living and dying alternately? Eustathius informs us that it is a physical allegory: They represent the two Hemispheres of the world; the one of which is continually enlighten'd by the sun, and consequently the other is then in darkness: and these being successively illuminated according to the order of the day and night, one of these sons of Jupiter may be said to revive when one part of the world rises into day, and the other to die, when it descends into darkness. What makes this allegory the more probable is, that Jupiter denotes in many allegories of Homer, the air, or the upper regions of it. In hell beneath, on earth, in heav'n above Reign the Twin-gods, the fav'rite sons of Jove. There Ephimedia trod the gloomy plain, Who charm'd the Monarch of the boundless main; Hence Ephialtes, hence stern Otus sprung, More fierce than Giants, more than Giants strong; The earth o'erburthen'd groan'd beneath their weight, None but Orion e'er surpass'd their height: The wond'rous youths had scarce nine winters told, When high in air, tremendous to behold, Nine ells aloft they rear'd their tow'ring head, This is undoubtedly a very bold fiction, and has been censur'd by some Critics as monstrous, and prais'd by others as sublime. It may seem utterly incredible that any human creatures could be nine ells, that is, eleven yards and a quarter in height, at the age of nine years. But it may vindicate Homer as a Poet to say that he only made use of a fable, that had been transmitted down from the earliest times of the world; for so early the war between the Gods and Giants was suppos'd to be. There might a rational account be given of these apparent incredibilities; if I might be allowed to say what many Authors of great name have conjectur'd, that these stories are only traditional, and all founded upon the ejection of the fallen Angels from Heaven, and the wars they had with the good Angels to regain their stations. If this might be allow'd, we shall then have real Giants, who endeavour'd to take Heaven by assault; then nothing can be invented by a Poet so boldly, as to exceed what may justly be believed of these beings: then the stories of heaping mountain upon mountain will come within the bounds of credibility. But without having recourse to this solution, Longinus brings this passage as an instance of true sublimity, chap. 6. He is proving that the Sublime is sometimes found without the pathetic, for some passions are mean, as fear, sadness, sorrow, and consequently incapable of sublimity; and on the other hand, there are many things great and sublime, in which there is no passion; of this kind is what Homer says concerning Otus, and Ephialtes, with so much boldness. The Gods they challenge, and affect the skies. And what he adds concerning the success of these Giants is still bolder. Had they to manhood grown, the bright abodes Of Heav'n had shook, and Gods been heap'd on Gods. Virgil was of the opinion of Longinus, for he has imitated Homer. Hic &amp; Aloidas geminos immania vidi Corpora, qui manibus magnum rescindere cœlum Aggressi, superisque Jovem detrudere regnis. Macrobius, lib. 5. Saturn. cap. 13. judges these verses to be inferior to Homer's in Majesty; in Homer we have the height and breadth of these Giants, and he happily paints the very size of their limbs in the run of his Poetry; two words, ????????, and ?????????, almost make one verse, deably chosen to express their bulk in the turn of the words; but Virgil says only immania corpora, and makes no addition concerning the Giants, omitting entirely the circumstance of their size; Homer relates the piling hill upon hill; Virgil barely adds, that they endeavour'd to storm the heavens. Scaliger is firm and faithful to Virgil, and vindicates his favourite in the true spirit of criticism; I persuade my self he glances at Macrobius, for he cavils at those instances which he produces as beauties in Homer; I give his answer in his own words. Admirantur Græculi pueriles mensuras; nimis sæpe cogor exclamare, aliud esse Græculum circulatorem, aliud regiæ orationis authorem: Indignam censuit suâ majestate Virgilius hanc minutam superstitionem, &amp;c. Eustathius remarks that the Antients greatly admir'd the exact proportion of these Giants, for the body is of a due symmetry, when the thickness is three degrees less than the height of it: According to this account, these Giants grew one cubit every year in bulk, and three in height. Homer says, that they fell by the shafts of Apollo, that is, they dy'd suddenly; but other writers relate, that as they were hunting, Diana sent a stag between them, at which both at once aiming their weapons and she withdrawing the stag, they fell by their own darts. Eustathius. And full nine cubits broad their shoulders spread. Proud of their strength and more than mortal size, The Gods they challenge, and affect the skies; Heav'd on Olympus tott'ring Ossa stood; Strabo takes notice of the judgment of Homer, in placing the mountains in this order; they all stand in Macedonia; Olympus is the largest, and therefore he makes it the basis upon which Ossa stands, that being the next to Olympus in magnitude, and Pelion being the least is placed above Ossa, and thus they rise pyramidically. Virgil follows a different regulation, Ter sunt conati imponere Pelion Ossæ, Scilicet atque Ossæ frondosum imponere Olympum. Here the largest mountain is placed uppermost, not so naturally as in the order of Homer. There is a peculiar beauty in the former of these verses, in which Virgil makes the two vowels in conati imponere meet without an elision, to express the labour and straining of the Giants in heaving mountain upon mountain. I appeal to the ear of every Reader, if he can pronounce these two words without a pause and stop; the difficulty in the flow of the verse excellently represents the labour of the Giants straining to shove Pelion upon Ossa. Dacier remarks that Virgil follows the situation of the mountains, without regarding the magnitude; thus Pelion lies first on the north of Macedonia, Ossa is the second, and the third Olympus; but she prefers Homer's method as most rational. On Ossa, Pelion nods with all his wood: Such were they Youths! had they to manhood grown, Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne. But ere the harvest of the beard began To bristle on the chin, and promise man, His shafts Apollo aim'd; at once they sound, And stretch the Giant-monsters o'er the ground. There mournful Phædra with sad Procris moves, Both beauteous shades, both hapless in their loves; And near them walk'd, with solemn pace and slow, Sad Ariadne, partner of their woe; The royal Minos Ariadne bred, She Theseus lov'd; from Crete with Theseus fled; Swift to the Dian Isle the Heroe flies, And tow'rds his Athens bears the lovely prize; Homer justifies Theseus from any crime with relation to Ariadne, he is guilty of no infidelity as succeeding Poets affirm; she dy'd suddenly in Dia, or Naxos (an Island lying between Thera and Crete) Diana slew her at the instigation of Bacchus, who accused her to that Goddess, for prophaning her temple by too free an intercourse with Theseus; this Homer calls ???????? ????????. Clymene was a daughter of Mynias, Mæra of Prœtus and Antæa, who having made a vow to Diana of perpetual virginity, broke it; and therefore fell by that Goddess. Phædra was wife to Theseus, and fell in love with her son Hippolytus. Eriphyle was the Daughter of Taläus and Lysimache, wife of the Prophet Amphiaraus; who being brib'd with a collar of gold by Polynices, obliged her husband to go to the war of Thebes, though she knew he was decreed to fall before that city: she was slain by her son Alcmæon. Eustathius. Ulysses, when he concludes, says it is time to repose Here in the court, or yonder on the waves. To understand this the Reader must remember, that in the beginning of the eighth book all things were prepar'd for his immediate voyage, or as it is there express'd, ? Ev'n now the gales Call thee aboard, and stretch the swelling sails. So that he desires to repose in the ship, that he may begin his voyage early in the morning. There Bacchus with fierce rage Diana fires, The Goddess aims her shaft, the Nymph expires. There Clymenè, and Mæra I behold, There Eriphylè weeps, who loosely sold Her lord, her honour, for the lust of gold. But should I all recount, the night would fail, Unequal to the melancholy tale: And all-composing rest my nature craves, Here in the court, or yonder on the waves; In you I trust, and in the heav'nly pow'rs, To land Ulysses on his native shores. He ceas'd: but left so charming on their ear I cannot tell whether this pause, or break in the narration of Ulysses has a good effect or not; whether it gives a relief to the Reader, or is an unexpected disappointment of the pursuit of the story? But certainly what is inserted during this short interruption, is particularly well chosen; it unites the Episode with the main action, and shews how it contributes to the end of the Odyssey, in influencing the Phæacians not only to restore Ulysses, but restore him with wealth and honour, which is the aim of the whole Poem. His voice, that list'ning still they seem'd to hear. 'Till rising up, Aretè silence broke, Eustathius observes, that the two motives which the Queen uses to move the Phæacians to liberality, is the relation Ulysses has to her, as her peculiar guest, (for Nausicaa first recommended him to the Queen's protection) and their own wealth: (for so he renders ??????? ?? ?????? ?????, and Dacier follows his interpretation) I have adventur'd to translate it differently, in this sense: “'Tis true, he is my peculiar guest, but you all share in the honour he does us, and therefore it is equitable to join in his assistance,” then she closes her speech with reminding them of their abilities; which in the other sense would be tautology. Stretch'd out her snowy hand, and thus she spoke: What wond'rous man heav'n sends us in our guest! Thro' all his woes the Heroe shines confest; His comely port, his ample frame express A manly air, majestic in distress. He, as my guest, is my peculiar care, You share the pleasure,—then in bounty share; To worth in misery a rev'rence pay, And with a gen'rous hand reward his stay; This I am persuaded is the true meaning of the passage; Ulysses had shew'd a desire immediately to go aboard, and the Queen draws an argument from this to induce the Phæacians to a greater contribution, and Ulysses to a longer stay; she persuades them to take time to prepare their presents, which must occasion the stay of Ulysses 'till they are prepar'd. They might otherwise (observes Dacier) have pretended to comply with the impatience of Ulysses, and immediately dismiss'd him with a small gratuity, under the pretext of not having time to prepare a greater. It must be confess'd, to the reproach of human Nature, that this is but too just a picture of it: Self-interest makes the Great very ready to gratify their petitioners with a dismission, or to comply with them to their disadvantage. For since kind heav'n with wealth our realm has blest, Give it to heav'n, by aiding the distrest. Then sage Echeneus, whose grave, rev'rend brow The hand of Time had silver'd o'er with snow, Mature in wisdom rose: Your words, he cries, Demand obedience, for your words are wise. But let our King direct the glorious way To gen'rous acts; our part is to obey. While life informs these limbs, (the King reply'd) Well to deserve, be all my cares employ'd: But here this night the royal guest detain, 'Till the sun flames along th'ethereal plain: Be it my task to send with ample stores The stranger from our hospitable shores; Tread you my steps! 'Tis mine to lead the race, The first in glory, as the first in place. To whom the Prince: This night with joy I stay, O Monarch great in virtue as in sway! If thou the circling year my stay controul, This speech of Ulysses has been condemned by the Critics, as avaritious; and therefore Eustathius judges it to be spoken artfully and complimentally; Didymus, with a well-bred urbanity, or ?????????: I see nothing mean in it, what Ulysses speaks proceeds from the gratitude of his soul; the heart of a brave man is apt to overflow while it acknowledges an obligation. Spondanus imagines that Ulysses may possibly speak jocosely, and asks if it is probable that he could be induc'd to stay from his country out of a mean consideration of a few presents, who had already preferr'd it to immortality? But in truth, Ulysses never behaves with levity; and it would give us an ill idea of that Heroe, should he return the united kindness of the Peers of Phæacia with scorn and derision: Besides, Ulysses values these presents no otherwise than as they may contribute to his re-establishment in his country; for he directly says, So by my realms due homage should be paid, A wealthy Prince is loyally obey'd. This is an evidence, that the words of Ulysses flow not from so base a fountain as avarice, but that all his thoughts and actions center upon his country. To raise a bounty noble as thy soul; The circling year I wait, with ampler stores And fitter pomp to hail my native shores: Then by my realms due homage would be paid; For wealthy Kings are loyally obey'd! O King! for such thou art, and sure thy blood Thro' veins (he cry'd) of royal fathers flow'd; Unlike those vagrants who on falshood live, Skill'd in smooth tales, and artful to deceive, Thy better soul abhors the liar's part, This in an instance of the judgment of Homer in sustaining his characters; the Phæacians were at first describ'd as a credulous people, and he gives us here an instance of their credulity, for they swallow all these fables as so many realities. The verse in the original is remarkable. ??? ?? ??? ??? ?????, ?????? ??? ?? ?????? ??????. Which Eustathius thinks was used by Alcinous, to tell Ulysses that his fables were so well laid together as to have the appearance of truths: Dacier follows him, and (as usual) delivers his opinion as her own sentiment. But this cannot be Homer's intention, for it supposes Alcinous to look upon these relations as fables, contrary to the universal character of their ignorant credulity; I therefore am persuaded that ????? ????? signifies the pleasantness or beauty of his relation, and ?????? ?????? the integrity of his heart in opposition to the character of a liar, or perhaps his wisdom in general: and this excellently agrees with his resembling him to a Musician, (who always was a Poet in those ages, and sung the exploits of Heroes, &amp;c. to the lyre.) In this view the sweetness of the music represents the agreeableness of the narration, and the subject of the musician's song the story of his adventures. Wise is thy voice, and noble is thy heart. Thy words like music every breast controul, Steal thro' the ear, and win upon the soul; Soft, as some song divine, thy story flows, Nor better could the Muse record thy woes. But say, upon the dark and dismal coast, Saw'st thou the Worthies of the Grecian Host? The God-like leaders who in battle slain, Fell before Troy, and nobly prest the plain? And lo! a length of night behind remains, The evening stars still mount th'ethereal plains. Thy tale with raptures I could hear thee tell, Thy woes on earth, the wond'rous scenes in hell, 'Till in the vault of heav'n the stars decay, And the sky reddens with the rising day. O worthy of the pow'r the Gods assign'd, (Ulysses thus replies) a King in mind! Since yet the early hour of night allows Time for discourse, and time for soft repose, If scenes of misery can entertain, Woes I unfold, of woes a dismal train. Prepare to hear of murther and of blood; Of god-like Heroes who uninjur'd stood Amidst a war of spears in foreign lands, Yet bled at home, and bled by female hands. Now summon'd Proserpine to hell's black hall The heroine shades; they vanish'd at her call. When lo! advanc'd the forms of Heroes slain By stern Ægysthus, a majestic train, And high above the rest, Atrides prest the plain. He quaff'd the gore: and strait his soldier knew, And from his eyes pour'd down the tender dew; His arms he stretch'd; his arms the touch deceive, Nor in the fond embrace, embraces give: His substance vanish'd, and his strength decay'd, Now all Atrides is an empty shade. Mov'd at the sight, I for a space resign'd To soft affliction all my manly mind, At last with tears—O what relentless doom Imperial Phantom, bow'd thee to the tomb? Say while the sea, and while the tempest raves, Has fate oppress'd thee in the roaring waves, Or nobly seiz'd thee in the dire alarms Of war and slaughter, and the clash of arms? The Ghost returns: O chief of humankind For active courage, and a patient mind; Nor while the sea, nor while the tempest raves, Has Fate oppress'd me on the roaring waves! Nor nobly seiz'd me in the dire alarms, Of war and slaughter, and the clash of arms, Stab'd by a murd'rous hand Atrides dy'd, A foul adult'rer, and a faithless bride; Ev'n in my mirth and at the friendly feast, O'er the full bowl, the traitor stab'd his guest; Thus by the goary arm of slaughter falls The stately Oxe, and bleeds within the stalls. But not with me the direful murther ends, These, these expir'd! their crime, they were my friends; Thick as the boars, which some luxurious lord Kills for the feast, to crown the nuptial board. When war has thunder'd with its loudest storms, Death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms; In duel met her, on the listed ground, When hand to hand they wound return for wound; But never have thy eyes astonish'd view'd So vile a deed, so dire a scene of blood. Ev'n in the flow of joy, when now the bowl Glows in our veins, and opens ev'ry soul, We groan, we faint; with blood the dome is dy'd, And o'er the pavement floats the dreadful tyde— Her breast all gore, with lamentable cries, The bleeding innocent Cassandra dies! Then tho' pale death froze cold in ev'ry vein, My sword I strive to wield, but strive in vain; Nor did my traitress wife these eyelids close, Or decently in death my limbs compose. O Woman, woman, when to ill thy mind Is bent, all hell contains no fouler fiend: And such was mine! who basely plung'd her sword Thro' the fond bosom where she reign'd ador'd! Alas! I hop'd, the toils of war o'ercome, To meet soft quiet and repose at home; Delusive hope! O wife, thy deeds disgrace The perjur'd sex, and blacken all the race; And should posterity one virtuous find, There cannot be a greater satyr upon the fair sex than this whole conference between Ulysses and Agamemnon. Terence has fall'n into the sentiment with Homer. Ædepol, næ nos æquè sumus omnes invisæ viris Propter paucas, quæ omnes faciunt dignæ ut videamur malo. But how is this to be reconciled to justice, and why should the innocent suffer for the crimes of the guilty? We are to take notice, that Agamemnon speaks with anger, an undistinguishing passion, and his words flow from resentment, not reason; it must be confess'd that Agamemnon had received great provocation, his wife had dishonour'd his bed, and taken his life away, it is therefore no wonder if he flies out-into a vehemence of language: a Poet is obliged to follow nature, and give a fierceness to the features, when he paints a person in such emotions, and add a violence to his colours. It has been objected that Homer, and even Virgil were enemies to the fairest part of the creation; that there is scarce a good character of a woman in either of the Poets: But Andromache in the Iliad, and Penelope, Arete, and Nausicaa in the Odyssey, are instances to the contrary. I must own I am a little at a loss to vindicate Ulysses in this place; he is speaking before Arete and Nausicaa, a Queen and her daughter; and entertains them with a satyr upon their own sex, which may appear unpolite, and a want of decency; and be applied by Alcinous as a caution to beware of his spouse, and not to trust her in matters of importance with his secrets: for this is the moral that is naturally drawn from the fable. Madam Dacier gives up the cause, and allows the advice of not trusting women to be good: it comes from her indeed a little unwillingly, with I will not say but the counsel may be right. I for my part will allow Ulysses to be in an hundred faults, rather than lay such an imputation upon the Ladies; Ulysses ought to be consider'd as having suffer'd twenty years calamities for that sex in the cause of Helen, and this possibly may give a little acrimony to his language. He puts it indeed in the mouth of Agamemnon; but the objection returns, why does he chuse to relate such a story before a Queen and her daughter? In short, I think they ought to have torn him to pieces, as the Ladies of Thrace serv'd Orpheus. Name Clytemnestra, they will curse the kind. O injur'd shade, I cry'd, what mighty woes Ulysses here means Aeropè the wife of Atreus, and mother of Agamemnon, who being corrupted by Thyestes, involv'd the whole family in the utmost calamities. Eustathius. To thy imperial race from woman rose! By woman here thou tread'st this mournful strand, And Greece by woman lies a desart land. Warn'd by my ills beware, the Shade replies, Nor trust the sex that is so rarely wise; When earnest to explore thy secret breast, Unfold some trifle, but conceal the rest. But in thy consort cease to fear a foe, For thee she feels sincerity of woe: When Troy first bled beneath the Grecian arms She shone unrival'd with a blaze of charms, Thy infant son her fragrant bosom prest, Hung at her knee, or wanton'd at her breast; But now the years a num'rous train have ran; The blooming boy is ripen'd into man; Thy eyes shall see him burn with noble fire, The sire shall bless his son, the son his sire: But my Orestes never met these eyes, Without one look the murther'd father dies; Then from a wretched friend this wisdom learn, Ev'n to thy Queen disguis'd, unknown, return; For since of womankind so few are just, Think all are false, nor ev'n the faithful trust. But say, resides my son in royal port, Eustathius gives us the reason why Agamemnon mentions Pyle, Sparta, and Orchomenos, as places where Orestes might make his residence: Sparta was under the dominion of his brother Menelaus: Pyle, of his old friend and faithful Counsellor Nestor; and Orchomenos was a city of great strength, and therefore of great security. We may evidently gather from this passage what notion the Antients had concerning a future state: namely, that persons after death were entirely strangers to the affairs of this world. For Orestes his son had slain his murderer Ægysthus, and reign'd in peaceable possession of his dominions; when Agamemnon is ignorant of the whole transaction, and desires Ulysses to give him information. In rich Orchomenos, or Sparta's court? Or say in Pyle? for yet he views the light, Nor glides a Phantom thro' the realms of night. Then I. Thy suit is vain, nor can I say If yet he breathes in realms of chearful day; Or pale or wan beholds these nether skies? Truth I revere: For Wisdom never lies. Thus in a tide of tears our sorrows flow, And add new horror to the realms of woe. 'Till side by side along the dreary coast Advanc'd Achilles' and Patroclus' ghost, Homer lets no opportunity pass of celebrating his Heroe Achilles, he cannot fail of awakening our attention to hear the story of this great man after death, of whom alive we saw such wonders. Besides, the Poet pays an honour to true friendship: The Person whom Achilles best lov'd on earth, is his chief companion in the other world: a very strong argument to cultivate friendship with sincerity. Achilles here literally fulfils what he promis'd in the Iliad. If in the melancholy shades below The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow, Yet mine shall sacred last; mine undecay'd Burn on thro' death, and animate my shade. A friendly pair! near these the Antilochus. Pylian stray'd, And tow'ring Ajax, an illustrious shade! War was his joy, and pleas'd with loud alarms, None but Pelides brighter shone in arms. Thro' the thick gloom his friend Achilles knew, And as he speaks the tears descend in dew. Com'st thou alive to view the Stygian bounds, Where the wan Spectres walk eternal rounds; Nor fear'st the dark and dismal waste to tread, Throng'd with pale ghosts, familiar with the dead? To whom with sighs: I pass these dreadful gates To seek the Theban, and consult the Fates: For still distrest I rove from coast to coast, Lost to my friends, and to my country lost. But sure the eye of time beholds no name So blest as thine in all the rolls of fame; Alive, we hail'd thee with our guardian Gods, And, dead thou rul'st a King in these abodes. Talk not of ruling in this dol'rous gloom, Nor think vain words (he cry'd) can ease my doom; Rather I chuse laboriously to bear A weight of woes, and breath the vital air, A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread; Nothing sure can give us a more disadvantagious image of a future state, than this speech which Homer puts into the mouth of so great an Heroe as Achilles. If the Poet intended to shew the vanity of that destructive glory which is purchased by the sword, and read a lecture to all the disturbers of mankind, whom we absurdly honour as Heroes, it must be allow'd he has done it effectually: If this was not his design, the remark of Plato 3 Repub. is not without a foundation; he there proscribes this whole passage as dangerous to morals, and blames the Poet for making Achilles say he prefers misery and servitude to all the honours which the dead are capable of enjoying. For what, says he, can make death more terrible to young persons? and will it not dispose them to suffer all calamities to avoid it, deter them from exposing themselves to danger, even in defence of their country, and teach them to be cowards and slaves? Lucian was of Plato's opinion, for he mentions this passage, and ridicules it in his dialogues. Dacier gives a different turn to it, and endeavours to shew that there is no danger of such consequences, as Plato draws from it: “Achilles, adds she, speaks directly contrary to his declared sentiments and actions, and therefore there is no danger he should persuade mankind to prefer servitude before death, when he himself dy'd rather than not revenge his friend Patroclus. Such words which are contradicted both by the sentiments and actions of him that speaks, have on the contrary a very good effect.” But I cannot come into her opinion, I will let Achilles answer for himself out of Lucian: “In the other world I was ignorant, says he, of the state of the dead, I had not experienced the difference between the two states, when I preferred a little empty glory to life.” This is an answer to what Dacier advances, for Achilles speaks with experience, and yet prefers misery and life before glory and death. I know not how to vindicate Homer, unless it be a vindication to say, that he wrote according to the opinions that antiently prevail'd in the world; or that like Hercules, while the vehicle of Achilles is in this state of horror, his soul may be in heaven; especially since he received divine honours after death, as well as Hercules. Tull. Nat. Deor. 3. Astypalæa Achillem sanctissimé colit, qui si Deus est, &amp; Orpheus, &amp;c. Than reign the scepter'd monarch of the dead. But say, if in my steps my son proceeds, And emulates his god-like father's deeds? If at the clash of arms, and shout of foes, Swells his bold heart, his bosom nobly glows? Say if my sire, the rev'rend Peleus reigns Great in his Pthia, and his throne maintains; Or weak and old, my youthful arm demands, To fix the scepter stedfast in his hands? O might the lamp of life rekindled burn, And death release me from the silent urn! This arm that thunder'd o'er the Phrygian plain, And swell'd the ground with mountains of the slain, Should vindicate my injur'd Father's fame, Crush the proud rebel, and assert his claim. Illustrious shade, (I cry'd) of Peleus' fates No circumstance the voice of fame relates; But hear with pleas'd attention the renown The wars and wisdom of thy gallant son: With me from Scyros to the field of fame Radiant in arms the blooming Heroe came: When Greece assembled all her hundred states To ripen counsels; and decide debates, Heav'ns! how he charm'd us with a flow of sense, And won the heart with manly Eloquence! He first was seen of all the Peers to rise, The third in wisdom where they all were wise; I have not ventured to render the Greek literally, Ulysses says that Neoptolemus was so wise, that only he himself and Nestor were wiser; a truth that would appear more graceful, if spoken by any other person than Ulysses. But perhaps the Poet puts these words into his mouth, only because he is speaking to the Phæacians, who loved themselves to boast, and were full of vain-glory; and consequently they could not think self-praise a crime in Ulysses; on the contrary, it could not fail of having a very good effect, as it sets him off as a person of consummate wisdom. The Poet excellently sustains the character of Achilles in this interview: In the Iliad he is describ'd a dutiful son, and always expressing a tender affection for his father Peleus; in the Odyssey he is drawn in the same soft colours: In the Iliad he is represented as a man of a strong resentment; in the Odyssey, he first imagines that his father suffers, and upon this imagination he immediately takes fire, and flies into threats and fury. Dictys, lib. 6. relates, that Peleus was expuls'd from his kingdom by Acastus, but that Pyrrhus the son of Achilles afterwards reveng'd the injury. But when to try the fortune of the day Host mov'd tow'rd host in terrible array, Before the van, impatient for the fight, With martial port he strode, and stern delight; Heaps strow'd on heaps beneath his fauchion groan'd, And monuments of dead deform'd the ground. The time would fail should I in order tell What foes were vanquish'd, and what numbers fell; How, lost thro' love, Eurypylus was slain, It must be own'd that this passage is very intricate: Strabo himself complains of its obscurity: The Poet (says that Author) rather proposes an Ænigma, than a clear History: for who are these Cetæans, and what are these presents of women? and adds, that the Grammarians darken, instead of clearing the obscurity. But it is no difficulty to solve these objections from Eustathius. It is evident from Strabo himself, that Eurypylus reign'd near the river Caïcus, over the Mysians, and Pliny confines it to Teuthranes; this agrees with what Ovid writes, Metam. 2. ? Teuthrantæusque Caïcus, And Virgil shews us that Caïcus was a river of Mysia, Georg. 4. Saxosumque sonans Hypanis, Mysusque Caïcus. But what relation has Caïcus to the Cetæans? Hesychius informs us, that they are a people of Mysia, so call'd from the river Cetium, which runs thro' their country; ???????, ????? ?????, ??? ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????. This river discharges it self into the Caïcus, and consequently the Cetæans, were Mysians, over whom Eurypylus reign'd. It would be endless to transcribe the different opinions of writers cited by Eustathius; some read the verse thus: ??????? ????????? ????????, ?????? ?????. Then the meaning will be, How they fell far from their wives, for the sake of a reward; that is, for their pay from Hector, who, as it appears from the Iliad, tax'd the Trojans to pay the auxiliaries, one of whom was Eurypylus. Others think the word signifies, Great of stature, and in this sense we find it used in the first line of the 4?? Odyssey. ? ??????????? ?????????. But I have follow'd the first opinion, as appearing most probable and natural. But how are we to explain the second objection, or ???????? ?????? ?????? Some (says Eustathius) understand the expression as apply'd to Neoptolemus, and not Eurypylus; namely, Eurypylus and his soldiers fell by means of the gifts of women; that is, Neoptolemus was led to the war by the promise of having Hermione in marriage, the daughter of Menelaus, which promise occasion'd the death of Eurypylus, by bringing Neoptolemus to the siege of Troy. Others understand it to be spoken of a golden vine, sent by Priam to his sister Astyoche the mother of Eurypylus, to induce her to persuade her son to undertake this expedition to Troy, where he was slain by the son of Achilles; this vine was said to be given to Tros the father of Priam by Jupiter, as a recompense for his carrying away his son Ganymede to be his cup-bearer; but this is too much a fable to be follow'd. Others more probably assert, that Priam had promis'd one of his daughters to Eurypylus, to engage his assistance in the war; and this agrees very well with Homer's manner of writing in many places of the Iliad; and there is a great resemblance between Eurypylus in the Odyssey and Othryoneus in the Iliad, lib. 13. 460. Cassandra's love he sought, with boasts of pow'r, And promis'd conquest was the profer'd dow'r. Spondanus cites a passage from Dictys, lib. 4. that very well explains these difficulties: Inter quæ tam læta, (nimirum mortem Achillis, &amp;c.) Priamo supervenit nuncius Eurypylum Telephi filium ex Mysia adventare, quem rex multis anteà illectum præmiis, ad postremum oblatione Cassandræ confirmaverat, addiderat etiam auream vitem, &amp; ob id per populos memorabilem. And round him bled his bold Cetæan train. To Troy no Heroe came of nobler line, Or if of nobler, Memnon, it was thine. When Ilion in the horse receiv'd her doom, And unseen armies ambush'd in its womb; Greece gave her latent warriors to my care, 'Twas mine on Troy to pour the imprison'd war: Then when the boldest bosom beat with fear, When the stern eyes of Heroes dropp'd a tear; Fierce in his look his ardent valour glow'd, Flush'd in his cheek, or sally'd in his blood; Indignant in the dark recess he stands, Pants for the battle, and the war demands; His voice breath'd death, and with a martial air He grasp'd his sword, and shook his glitt'ring spear. And when the Gods our arms with conquest crown'd, When Troy's proud bulwarks smok'd upon the ground, Greece to reward her soldier's gallant toils Heap'd high his navy with unnumber'd spoils. Thus great in glory from the din of war Safe he return'd, without one hostile scar; Tho' spears in iron tempests rain'd around, Yet innocent they play'd, and guiltless of a wound. While yet I spoke, the Shade with transport glow'd, Rose in his majesty and noblier trod; With haughty stalk he sought the distant glades Of warrior Kings, and join'd th'illustrious shades. Now without number ghost by ghost arose, All wailing with unutterable woes. Alone, apart, in discontented mood A gloomy shade, the sullen Ajax stood; For ever sad with proud disdain he pin'd, And the lost arms for ever stung his mind; Tho' to the contest Thetis gave the laws, There are two particulars which want explication in these verses: How did Thetis give the law to the contest between Ajax and Ulysses? and how could the Trojans be made judges to determine between two Grecian Heroes? Thetis the mother of Achilles was a Goddess, and out of honour to her, the Chiefs of the Grecian army propos'd the arms of her son as a reward to the most worthy; and Poetry, to give a magnificence to the story, introduces the Goddess as acting in person what is done upon her account. Thetis may properly be said to be desirous that the memory of her son should be honoured; and Homer to express this desire poetically, tells us it was the act of that Goddess, to propose the arms of Achilles as a reward to the most worthy of the Grecian Heroes. The second difficulty is fully explain'd by Eustathius: Agamemnon finding it an invidious affair to give the preference to any one of the Grecian Heroes, and being willing to avoid the reproach of partiality, commanded the Trojan prisoners to be brought before the whole army, and ask'd from which of the two Heroes, Ajax or Ulysses, they had received the greater detriment; they immediately reply'd from Ulysses; thus the Trojans adjudg'd the cause. The Poet adds, that this was done by Minerva; that is, the affair was conducted with wisdom, the result of which in Poetry is usually ascrib'd to the Goddess of it; and no doubt but the Goddess of Wisdom must always prefer Wisdom to mere Valour, or an Ulysses to an Ajax. This decision is related in a very different manner by other Poets; in particular, by Ovid in his Metamorphosis; but Lucian in his Dialogues agrees with Homer in every point very circumstantially; and consequently, with some obscurity; but what I have here said fully explains that dialogue of Lucian, as well as this passage of Homer. And Pallas, by the Trojans judg'd the cause. O why was I victorious in the strife; O dear-bought honour with so brave a life! With him the strength of war, the soldiers pride, Our second hope to great Achilles dy'd! Touch'd at the sight from tears I scarce refrain, And tender sorrow thrills in ev'ry vein; Pensive and sad I stand, at length accost, With accents mild, th'inexorable ghost. Still burns thy rage? and can brave souls resent Ev'n after death? relent, great Shade, relent! Perish those arms which by the Gods decree Accurs'd our army with the loss of thee! With thee we fell; Greece wept thy hapless fates, And shook astonish'd thro' her hundred states; Not more, when great Achilles prest the ground, And breath'd his manly spirit thro' the wound. O deem thy fall not ow'd to man's decree, Jove hated Greece, and punish'd Greece in thee! Turn then, oh peaceful turn, thy wrath controul, And calm the raging tempest of thy soul. While yet I speak, the shade disdains to stay, This silence of Ajax was very much admired by the Antients, and Longinus proposes it as an instance of the true sublimity of thought, which springs from an elevation of soul, and not from the diction; for a man may be truly sublime without speaking a word: Thus in the silence of Ajax there is something more noble, than in any thing he could possibly have spoken. Monsieur Rapin agrees with Longinus: The stubborn untractable Ajax (says that Author) could not have made a better return to the compliments full of submission which were paid him by Ulysses, than by a disdainful and contemptuous silence: Ajax has more the air of grandeur and majesty, when he says nothing, than when the Poet makes him speak. Virgil was sensible of the beauty of it, and paints Dido in the attitude of Ajax. Fraguier infinitely prefers the silence of Dido to that of Ajax; she was a woman disappointed in love, and therefore no wonder if she was greatly passionate, and sunk under the weight of the calamity; but Ajax was a Heroe, and ought to have freed himself by his courage from such an unworthy degree of resentment. But to me there appears no weight in this objection: We must remember what an Heroe Ajax is, a sour, stubborn, untractable Heroe; and upon all occasions given to taciturnity; this is his universal and notorious character thro' the whole Iliad: The Poet therefore adapts his description to it, and he is the same Ajax in the Odyssey as he was in the Iliad: Had this been spoken of any other Heroe, the criticism had been more just, but in Ajax this stubborn silence is proper and noble. In silence turns, and sullen stalks away. Touch'd at his sour retreat, thro' deepest night, Thro' hell's black bounds I had pursu'd his flight, And forc'd the stubborn spectre to reply; But wond'rous visions drew my curious eye. High on a throne, tremendous to behold, Stern Minos waves a mace of burnish'd gold; Around ten thousand thousand spectres stand Thro' the wide dome of Dis, a trembling band. Still as they plead, the fatal lots he rowls, The expression in the Greek is remarkable, ??????, ???????? ??; that is, “standing and sitting;” this is to be referr'd to different persons; the ???????? were the ???????????, or persons who pleaded the cause of the guilty or innocent before the infernal judges: The ?????? were the persons for whom they pleaded, or those who were about to receive judgment. I doubt not but this was a custom observ'd in the courts of Judicature in the days of Homer. Eustathius. Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. There huge Orion of portentous size, The diversion of this infernal hunter may seem extraordinary in pursuing the shades of beasts; but it was the opinion of the Antients, that the same passions to which men were subject on earth continued with them in the other world; and their shades were liable to be affected in the same manner as their bodies: Thus we frequently see them shedding tears, and Sisyphus sweats, in rolling the stone up the mountain. Virgil. Stant terra defixæ hastæ, passimque soluti Per campos pascuntur equi, quæ cura nitentes Pascere equos, eadem sequitur tellure repostos. And again. ? Curæ non ipsâ in morte relinquunt. I cannot but be of opinion that Milton has far surpass'd both the Greek and the Roman Poet, in the description of the employment of the fall'n Angels in Hell, as the Ideas are more noble and suitable to the characters he describes. Part on the plain, or in the air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, As at th'Olympian games or Pythian fields: Part curb the fiery steeds, or shun the goal With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form. Others with vast Typhæan rage more fell Rend up both rocks, and hills, and ride the air In whirlwind: Hell scarce holds the wild uproar. ? others more mild Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many an harp, Their own heroic deeds— The song was partial, but the harmony Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience, &amp;c. Swift thro' the gloom a Giant-hunter flies; A pond'rous mace of brass with direful sway Aloft he whirls, to crush the savage prey; Stern beasts in trains that by his truncheon fell, Now grisly forms, shoot o'er the lawns of hell. There Tityus large and long, in fetters bound, It is needless to mention that Virgil has adorn'd his descent into Hell with most of these fables borrow'd from Homer; It is equally unnecessary to relate what antiquity says of these fabled persons, and their histories; but the moral of them all is observ'd by Eustathius, and fully explain'd by Lucretius, which I will lay together from Mr. Dryden's translation. —The dismal tales that Poets tell Are verify'd on earth, and not in hell; No Tantalus looks with a fearful eye, Or dreads th'impending rock to crush him from on high; No Tityus, torn by Vulturs, lies in hell, Nor could the lobes of his rank liver swell To that prodigious mass, for their eternal meal. But he's the Tityus, who, by love oppress'd, Or tyrant passion preying on his breast, And ever anxious thoughts, is robb'd of rest. The Sisyphus is he, whom noise and strife Seduce from all the soft retreats of life, To vex the government, disturb the laws, Drunk with the fumes of popular applause, He courts the giddy croud to make him great, And sweats and toils in vain, to mount the sov'reign seat For still to aim at pow'r, and still to fail, Ever to strive, and never to prevail, What is it, but in reason's true account, To heave the stone against the rising mount? I will only add the reason from Eustathius, why Tityus was fabled to be the son of the earth; it was from his being immers'd in worldly cares, and from his centring all his affections upon the earth, as if he had sprung from it; this is alluded by the expression ???????? ?? ??????. Spondanus gives us another reason; Elara being pregnant by Jupiter, he to avoid the jealousy of Juno concealed her in a cavern of the earth, where Tityus being born, is fabled to be the son of the earth: He adds, that the fiction of his covering nine acres, arose from that space of ground which was enclosed for his place of burial. Perhaps the story of Tantalus was invented solely to paint the nature of a covetous person, who starves amidst plenty, like Tantalus in the midst of water. Thus Horace applies it, Satyr. 1. v. 70. Tantalus a labris sitiens fugientia captat Flumina. quid rides? mutato nomine de te Fabula narratur. congestis undique saccis Indormis inhians, &amp; tanquam parcere sacris Cogeris ? O'erspreads nine acres of infernal ground; Two rav'nous vulturs furious for their food Scream o'er the fiend, and riot in his blood, Incessant gore the liver in his breast, Th'immortal liver grows, and gives th'immortal feast. For as o'er Panopé's enamel'd plains Latona journey'd to the Pythian fanes, With haughty love th'audacious monster strove To force the Goddess, and to rival Jove. There Tantalus along the Stygian bounds Pours out deep groans; (with groans all hell resounds) Ev'n in the circling floods refreshment craves, And pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves: When to the water he his lip applies, Back from his lip the treach'rous water flies. Above, beneath, around his hapless head, Trees of all kinds delicious fruitage spread; There figs sky-dy'd, a purple hue disclose, Green looks the olive, the pomegranate glows, There dangling pears exalted scents unfold, And yellow apples ripen into gold; The fruit he strives to seize: but blasts arise, Toss it on high, and whirl it to the skies. I turn'd my eye, and as I turn'd survey'd A mournful vision! the Sisyphyan shade; With many a weary step, and many a groan, Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone; This is a very remarkable instance of the beauty of Homer's versification; it is taken notice of by Eustathius, but copiously explain'd by Dionysius Halicarn. in his treatise of placing of words. ???? ?????????? ???????? ???????????, ???? ? ??? ????????????? ?????? ?? ????? ??, ???? ??? ?????? ? Here (says Dionysius) we see in the choice and disposition of the words the fact which they describe; the weight of the stone, and the striving to heave it up the mountain: To effect this, Homer clogs the verse with Spondees or long syllables, and leaves the vowels open, as in ????, and in ??????, which two words it is impossible to pronounce without hesitation and difficulty; the very words and syllables are heavy, and as it were make resistance in the pronounciation, to express the heaviness of the stone, and the difficulty with which it is forced up the mountain. To give the English Reader a faint image of the beauty of the original in the translation, I have loaded the verse with monosyllables, and these almost all begin with Aspirates. Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone. Homer is no less happy in describing the rushing down of the stone from the top of the mountain. Is it not evident, (continues Dionysius) that the swiftness of the verse imitates the celerity of the stone in its descent; nay, that the verse runs with the greater rapidity? What is the cause of this? It is because there is not one monosyllable in the line, and but two dissyllables, ten of the syllables are short, and not one spondee in it, except one that could not be avoided at the conclusion of it; there is no hiatus or gap between word and word, no vowels left open to retard the celerity of it: the whole seems to be but one word, the syllables melt into one another, and flow away with the utmost rapidity in a torrent of Dactyls. I was too sensible of the beauty of this not to endeavour to imitate it, tho' unsuccessfully: I have therefore thrown it into the swiftness of an Alexandrine, to make it of a more proportionable number of syllables with the Greek. I refer the Reader for a fuller explication of these verses to Dionysius. The huge round stone, resulting with a bound, Thunders impetuous down, and smoaks along the ground. Again the restless orb his toil renews, Dust mounts in clouds, and sweat descends in dews. Now I the strength of Hercules behold, A tow'ring spectre of gigantic mold, A shadowy form! for high in heav'n's abodes This is the passage formerly referr'd to in these annotations, to prove that Hercules was in heaven, while his shade was in the infernal regions; a full evidence of the partition of the human composition into three parts: The body is buried in the earth; the image or ??????? descends into the regions of the departed; and the soul, or the divine part of man, is receiv'd into Heaven: Thus the body of Hercules was consumed in the flames, his image is in Hell, and his soul in Heaven. There is a beautiful moral couch'd in the fable of his being married to Hebe, or youth, after death: to imply, that a perpetual youth or a reputation which never grows old, is the reward of those Heroes, who like Hercules employ their courage for the good of humankind. Himself resides, a God among the Gods; There in the bright assemblies of the skies, He Nectar quaffs, and Hebe crowns his joys. Here hovering ghosts, like fowl, his shade surround, And clang their pinions with terrific sound; Gloomy as night he stands, in act to throw Th'aerial arrow from the twanging bow. Around his breast a wond'rous Zone is rowl'd, Where woodland monsters grin in fretted gold, There sullen Lions sternly seem to roar, The bear to growl, to foam the tusky boar: There war and havoc and destruction stood, And vengeful murther red with human blood. Thus terribly adorn'd the figures shine, Inimitably wrought with skill divine. This verse is not without obscurity; Eustathius gives us several interpretations of it. ?? ????????????, ?? ?? ???? ?? ?????????? The negative ??, by being repeated, seems to be redundant; and this in a great measure occasions the difficulty; but in the Greek language two negatives more strongly deny; this being premis'd, we may read the verse as if the former ?? were absent, and then the meaning will be, “He that made this Zone, never made any thing equal to it:” as if we should say, that Phidias who made the statue of Jupiter never made any other statue like it; that is, he employed the whole power of his skill upon it. Others understand the verse as an execration: Oh never, never may the hand that made it, make any thing again so terrible as this Zone! And this will give some reason for the repetition of the negative particles. Dacier approves of this latter explication, and moralizes upon it: It proceeds (says she) from a tender sentiment of humanity in Ulysses, who wishes that there may never more be occasion for such a design, as the artist executed in this belt of Hercules; that there may be no more giants to conquer, no more monsters to tame, or no more human blood be shed. I wish that such a pious and well-natur'd explication were to be drawn from the passage! But how is it possible that the artist who made this Zone should ever make another, when he had been in his grave some Centuries? (for such a distance there was between the days of Hercules and Ulysses;) and consequently it would be impertinent to wish it. I have therefore followed the former interpretation. I will only add, that this belt of Hercules is the reverse of the girdle of Venus; in that, there is a collection of every thing that is amiable, in this, a variety of horrors; but both are master-pieces in their kind. The mighty ghost advanc'd with awful look, And turning his grim visage, sternly spoke. O exercis'd in grief! by arts refin'd! O taught to bear the wrongs of base mankind! Such, such was I! still tost from care to care, While in your world I drew the vital air; Ev'n I who from the Lord of thunders rose, Bore toils and dangers, and a weight of woes; To a base Monarch still a slave confin'd, (The hardest bondage to a gen'rous mind!) Down to these worlds I trod the dismal way, Nothing can be more artfully inserted than the mention of this descent of Hercules into the regions of the dead: Ulysses shews by it at least that it was a vulgar opinion, and consequently within the degrees of poetical probability; a Poet being at liberty to follow common fame: In particular, it could not fail of having a full effect upon his Phæacian auditors, not only as it in some measure sets him upon a level with Hercules, but as it is an example of a like undertaking with this which he has been relating, and therefore a probable method to gain their belief of it. Eustathius. And drag'd the three-mouth'd dog to upper day; Ev'n hell I conquer'd, thro' the friendly aid Of Maia's offspring and the martial Maid. Thus he, nor deign'd for our reply to stay, But turning stalk'd with giant strides away. Curious to view the Kings of antient days, The mighty dead that live in endless praise, Resolv'd I stand; and haply had survey'd Plutarch in his life of Theseus informs us, that this verse has been thought not genuine; but added to the Odyssey in honour of the Athenians by Pisistratus. The Poet shews us that he had still a noble fund of invention, and had it in his power to open new scenes of wonder and entertainment; but that this infernal Episode might not be too long, he shifts the scene: The invention of the Gorgon, which terrifies him from a longer abode in these realms of darkness gives a probable reason for his immediate return. Eustathius informs us from Athenæus, that Alexander the Mydian writes in his History of Animals, that there really was a creature in Lybia, which the Nomades call'd a Gorgon; it resembled a wild Ram, or as some affirm a calf; whose breath was of such a poisonous nature, as to kill all that approach'd it: In the same region the Catolepton is found, a creature like a bull, whose eyes are so fix'd in the head as chiefly to look downward; Pliny calls it Catoblepas, lib. 8. cap. 21. which is likewise supposed to kill with its eyes: The Gorgon (proceeds Athenæus) has its hair hanging over its eyes down from the forehead, of such thickness that it scarce is able to remove it, to guide it self from danger; but it kills not by its breath, but with emanations darted from its eyes: The beast was well known in the time of Marius, for certain of his soldiers seeing it, mistook it for a wild sheep, and pursued it to take it; but the hair being removed by the motion of its flying, it slew all upon whom it look'd: at length the Nomades, who knew the nature of the beast, destroy'd it with darts at a distance, and carried it to the General Marius. Howsoever little truth there be in this story, it is a sufficient ground for poetical fictions, and all the fables that are ascrib'd to the Gorgon. The god-like Theseus, and Perithous' shade; But swarms of spectres rose from deepest hell, With bloodless visage, and with hideous yell, They scream, they shriek; sad groans and dismal sounds Stun my scar'd ears, and pierce hell's utmost bounds. No more my heart the dismal din sustains, And my cold blood hangs shiv'ring in my veins; Lest Gorgon rising from th'infernal lakes, With horrors arm'd, and curls of hissing snakes, Should fix me, stiffen'd at the monstrous sight, A stony image, in eternal night! Strait from the direful coast to purer air It may not probably be unpleasant to the Reader, to observe the manner how the two great Poets Homer and Virgil close the scene of their infernal adventures, by restoring their Heroes to the earth. Ulysses returns by the same way he descended, of which we have a plain description in the beginning of this book: Virgil takes a different method, he borrows his conclusion from another part of Homer; in which he describes the two gates of sleep; the one is ivory, the other of horn: Thro' the ivory gate, issue falshoods, through the gate of horn truths: Virgil dismisses Æneas through the gate of falshood: Now what is this, but to inform us that all that he relates is nothing but a dream, and that dream a falshood? I submit it to the Critics who are more disposed to find fault than I am, to determine whether Virgil ought to be censured for such an acknowledgment, or prais'd for his ingenuity? I speed my flight, and to my mates repair. My mates ascend the ship; they strike their oars; The mountains lessen, and retreat the shores; Swift o'er the waves we fly; the fresh'ning gales Sing thro' the shrouds, and stretch the swelling sails. THE TWELFTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Sirens, Scylla, and Charybdis. He relates, how after his return from the Shades, he was sent by Circe on his voyage, by the coast of the Sirens, and by the streight of Scylla and Charybdis: The manner in which he escap'd those dangers: How being cast on the Island Trinacria, his companions destroy'd the Oxen of the Sun: The vengeance that follow'd; how all perish'd by shipwreck except himself, who swimming on the mast of the ship, arriv'd on the Island of Calypso. With which his narration concludes. We are now drawing to a conclusion of the Episodic narration of the Odyssey; it may therefore not be unentertaining to speak something concerning the nature of it, before we dismiss it. There are two ways of relating past subjects: the one, simply and methodically by a plain rehearsal, and this is the province of History; the other artificially, where the Author makes no appearance in person, but introduces Speakers, and this is the practice of Epic Poetry. By this method the Poet brings upon the stage those very persons who perform'd the action he represents: he makes them speak and act over again the words and actions they spoke or perform'd before, and in some sort transports his auditors to the time when, and the places where, the action was done. This method is of great use, it prevents the Poet from delivering his story in a plain simple way like an Historian, it makes the Auditors witnesses of it, and the action discovers itself. Thus for instance, it is not Homer but Ulysses who speaks; the Poet is withdrawn, and the Heroe whose story we hear is as it were rais'd from the grave, and relates it in person to the audience. Aristotle observes, that the Epic Poem ought to be Dramatic, that is active; Homer (says that Author) ought to be especially commended for being the only Poet who knew exactly what to do; he speaks little himself, but introduces some of his persons, a man or a woman, a God or a Goddess; and this renders his Poem active or dramatic. Narration is the very soul that animates the Poem, it gives an opportunity to the Poet to adorn it with different Episodes; it has, as it were, the whole world for its stage, and gives him liberty to search thro' the Creation for incidents or adventures for the employment of his Heroes: Thus for instance, he was at liberty to ascribe the several dangers of Scylla and Charybdis, of Polypheme and Antiphates to Ulysses, tho' that Heroe had been as unacquainted with those dangers, as Æneas was in reality with Dido; the choice of the Episodes being not essential, but arbitrary. In short, it is from this Episodic narration that the Poet could at all find room to place these Episodes in the Odyssey. Aristotle, 1 confess, has set no precise limits to the time of the action, but the Critics in general confine it to one Campaign; at least, they affirm this to be the most perfect duration, according to the model of the Iliad and Odyssey. Now this Episodic narration gives the Poet an opportunity to relate all that is contain'd in four books without breaking in upon the time of the action: for all that we read between the eighth book and the thirteenth comprehends only the space of one evening; namely, the evening of the thirty third day. The Poet inserts all the adventures that happen'd to Ulysses in almost ten years from his departure from Troy, into the compass of one evening by way of narration, and so maintains the Unity both of the time and action. I speak not of the Narration in general; concerning which the curious may consult Bossu, or Dryden's preface to the translation of the Æneis. Thus o'er the rolling surge the vessel flies, The words in the original are ???????? ???? ????????, which Strabo judges to mean no more than a part of the ocean, for if it be otherwise understood it will be a tautology, and who would write that he went out of the ocean into the ocean, as it must be rendered if ??????? be the same with ??????? in the next line? But it is perhaps better to understand the passage literally and plainly, only to denote the place from whence Ulysses return'd from his infernal voyage; that is, from the extremity of the Ocean. It is usual for the waves of the sea to bear violently and rapidly upon the same shores, the waters being pent up by the nearness of the land, and therefore forming a current, or ????. So that the expression means no more than Ulysses surmounted this current, and then gain'd the wide Ocean. It is likewise evident from the beginning of this book, that Ulysses pass'd only one night in Hell; for he arriv'd at the Cimmerians in one day, saw the visions of Hell in the following night, and in the space of the next day returned from the Cimmerians in the evening to Circe's Island, as appears from his going to repose immediately upon his landing. It may be further prov'd that this was a Nocturnal interview, from the nature of the magical incantations which were always perform'd by night; all sacrifices were offer'd by night to the infernal powers, the offering it self was black, to represent the kingdom of darkness: Thus also in other Poets the Moon is said to turn pale at these magical rites, or as Virgil expresses it, Carmina vel cœlo possunt deducere lunam. And indeed, as Eustathius observes (from whom this note is chiefly translated) it would have been absurd to have represented the realms of darkness survey'd by the light of the day. 'Till from the waves th'Ææan hills arise. Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bow'rs, This passage is full of obscurity: For how is it possible to suppose this Island of Circe to be the residence of the Morning; that is, for the day to rise immediately upon it, when it is known to lie in a western situation? Some have imagin'd that this is spoken solely with respect to Ulysses, who returning from the shades, might properly say that he arriv'd at the place where the day resides, that is to a place enlighten'd by the sun. Others understand it comparatively, with respect to the Cimmerians, or rather to the realms of death, which Homer places in the west; with regard to these, Ææa may be said to lie in the east, or in the poetical language, to be the residence of the morning. Besides the Circæan promontory is of an extraordinary altitude, and consequently the beams at sun-rising may fall upon it; nay, it is said to be illustrated by the Sun even by night. Others have conjectur'd, that what is here said implies no more than that Ulysses landed upon the eastern parts of the Island: And lastly, others not improbably refer the whole to the word Ocean in the former line, and then the whole passage will be clear, and agree with the fable of the Sun's rising and setting in the Ocean. This is what Eustathius remarks, who adds, that the Antients understood ????? not to signify dances, but ?????, the regions of the morning. I have translated it in the former sense, according to the consent of most interpreters: And I am persuaded it is used to denote the pleasure and gaiety which the Sun restores to the whole Creation, when dispelling the melancholy darkness, he restores light and gladness to the earth; which is imag'd to us by the playing or dancing of the first beams of the Sun; or rather of Aurora, who properly may be said to dance, being a Goddess. Dacier renders ?????, dances; but judges that Homer here follows a fabulous Geography, and that as he transported the Cimmerians with all their darkness from the Bosphorus to Campania; so likewise he now removes Ææa with all its light from Cholchis into Italy: and therefore the Poet gives the properties and situation to the Island of Circe, which are only true of the eastern Cholchis. It is very evident (continues she) that Homer was perfectly acquainted with the Phœnician story; he tells us that Elpenor was buried upon the promontory on the sea-shores, and that it was called by his name, Elpenor. Now the Phœnicians, who endeavour'd to naturalize all names in their own language, affirm'd, according to Bochart, that this promontory was not so call'd from Elpenor, but from their word Hilbinor, which signifies, ubi albescit lux matutinæ; that is, “where the dawning of the day begins to appear:” This promontory being of great height, the rays of the morning might fall upon it; and this tradition might furnish Homer with his fiction of the bow'rs, and dances of it. What may seem to confirm Dacier's opinion of the transportation of Cholchis into Italy, is the immediate mention the Poet makes of Jason, and Æætes King of Cholchis: Besides the Antients believed Phasis, a river of Cholchis, to be the bounds of the habitable oriental world: and Ææa being the capital of it, lying upon the Phasis, it might very rationally be mistaken for the place where the Sun rose; thus Mimnermus writes, ?????? ????? ???? ?? ????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ???? ??????? ??? ????? ????? ?????. That is, “the city of Æëtes where the rays of the Sun appear in a bed of gold, above the margin of the Ocean, where the divine Jason arriv'd:” This is an evidence that the Poet was well acquainted with Antiquity, and that (as Strabo judges) his astonishing fictions have truth for their foundation. Here keeps her revels with the dancing Hours; Here Phœbus rising in th'etherial way, Thro' heav'n's bright portals pours the beamy day. At once we fix our haulsers on the land, At once descend, and press the desart sand; There worn and wasted, lose our cares in sleep To the hoarse murmurs of the rowling deep. Soon as the morn restor'd the day, we pay'd Sepulchral honours to Elpenor's shade. Now by the axe the rushing forest bends, And the huge pyle along the shore ascends. Around we stand, a melancholy train, And a loud groan re-ecchoes from the main. Fierce o'er the Pyre, by fanning breezes spread, The hungry flame devours the silent dead. A rising tomb, the silent dead to grace, Fast by the roarings of the main we place; The rising tomb a lofty column bore, And high above it rose the tapering oar. Mean-time the Circe. Goddess our return survey'd From the pale ghosts, and hell's tremendous shade. Swift she descends: A train of nymphs divine Bear the rich viands and the generous wine: In act to speak the Circe. Pow'r of magic stands, And graceful thus accosts the list'ning bands. O sons of woe! decreed by adverse fates Alive to pass thro' hell's eternal gates! All, soon or late, are doom'd that path to tread; More wretched you! twice number'd with the dead! This day adjourn your cares; exalt your souls, Indulge the taste, and drein the sparkling bowls: And when the morn unveils her saffron ray, Spread your broad sails, and plow the liquid way: Lo I this night, your faithful guide, explain Your woes by land, your dangers on the main. The Goddess spoke; in feasts we waste the day, 'Till Phœbus downward plung'd his burning ray; Then sable Night ascends, and balmy rest Seals ev'ry eye, and calms the troubled breast. Then curious she commands me to relate The dreadful scenes of Pluto's dreary state. She sate in silence while the tale I tell, The wond'rous visions, and the laws of Hell. Then thus: The lot of man the Gods dispose; These ills are past; now hear thy future woes. O Prince attend! some sav'ring pow'r be kind, And print th'important story on thy mind! Next, where the Sirens dwell, you plow the seas; The Critics have greatly labour'd to explain what was the foundation of this fiction of the Sirens. We are told by some, that the Sirens were Queens of certain small Islands, named Sirenusæ, that lie near Capreæ in Italy, and chiefly inhabited the promontory of Minerva, upon the top of which that Goddess had a temple, as some affirm, built by Ulysses, according to this verse of Seneca, Epist. 77. Alta procelloso speculatur vertice Pallas. Here, there was a renown'd Academy in the reign of the Sirens, famous for Eloquence and the liberal Sciences, which gave occasion for the invention of this fable of the sweetness of the voice, and attracting songs of the Sirens. But why then are they fabled to be destroyers, and painted in such dreadful colours? We are told that at last the Students abus'd their knowledge, to the colouring of wrong, the corruption of manners, and subversion of government; that is, in the language of Poetry, they were feign'd to be transform'd into monsters, and with their music to have entic'd passengers to their ruin, who there consum'd their patrimonies, and poison'd their virtues with riot and effeminacy. The place is now call'd Massa. In the days of Homer the Sirens were fabled to be two only in number, as appears from his speaking of them in the dual, as ??? ??????????, ????? ??????????; their names (adds Eustathius) were Thelxiepæa, and Aglaopheme. Other writers, in particular Lycophron, mention three Sirens, Ligæa, Parthenope, and Leucosia. Some are of opinion (continues the same Author) that they were ???????? ??? ?????????; that is, “singing women and harlots,” who by the sweetness of their voices drew the unwary to ruin their health and fortune. Others tell us of a certain Bay contracted within winding streights and broken cliffs, which by the singing of the winds, and beating of the waters, returns a delightful harmony; that allures the passenger to approach, who is immediately thrown against the rocks, and swallow'd up by the violent eddies. But others understand the whole passage allegorically, or as a fable containing an excellent moral, to shew that if we suffer our selves to be too much allur'd by the pleasures of an idle life, the end will be destruction: thus Horace moralizes it; ? Vitanda est improba Siren Desidia ?. But the fable may be apply'd to all pleasures in general, which if too eagerly pursu'd betray the uncautious into ruin; while wise men, like Ulysses, making use of their reason stop their ears against their insinuations. Their song is death, and makes destruction please. Unblest the man, whom music wins to stay Nigh the curst shore, and listen to the lay; No more that wretch shall view the joys of life, His blooming offspring, or his beauteous wife! In verdant meads they sport, and wide around There is a great similitude between this passage and the words of Solomon in the Proverbs, where there is a most beautiful description of an harlot, in the eighth and ninth chapters. I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding; and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart, &amp;c. With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, she forced him with the flattering of her lips: he goeth after her straightway, as an Ox goeth to the slaughter, but he knoweth not that the dead are there, and her guests are in the depths of Hell. This may serve for a comment upon Homer, and it is an instance, that without any violence the nature of Harlots may be conceal'd under the fable of the Sirens. Lie human bones, that whiten all the ground; The ground polluted floats with human gore, And human carnage taints the dreadful shore. Fly swift the dang'rous coast; let ev'ry ear Be stop'd against the song! 'tis death to hear! Firm to the mast with chains thy self be bound, Nor trust thy virtue to th'enchanting sound. If mad with transport, freedom thou demand, Be every fetter strain'd, and added band to band. These seas o'erpass'd, be wise! but I refrain To mark distinct thy voyage o'er the main: New horrors rise! let prudence be thy guide, And guard thy various passage thro' the tyde. High o'er the main two Rocks exalt their brow, There is undoubtedly a great amplification in the description of Scylla and Charybdis; it may not therefore be unnecessary to lay before the Reader, what is truth and what fiction. Thucydides, lib. 4. thus describes it. “This streight is the sea that flows between Rhegium and Messenè, where at the narrowest distance, Sicily is divided from the Continent; and this is that part of the sea which Ulysses is said to have pass'd, and 'tis call'd Charybdis: This sea, by reason of the streights, and the concourse of the Tyrrhene and Sicilian seas breaking violently into it, and there raising great commotions, is with good reason called ??????, or destructive.” Charybdis stands on the coast of Sicily; Scylla on the coast of Italy. Mr: Sandys examin'd these rocks and seas with a particular view to the descriptions of the Poets: Speaking of Charybdis, he writes, When the winds begin to ruffle, especially from the south, it forthwith runs round with violent eddies, so that many vessels miscarry by it. The stream thro' the streight runs toward the Ionian, and part of it sets into the haven, which turning about, and meeting with other streams makes so violent an encounter that ships are glad to prevent the danger by coming to an anchor. Scylla, adds he, is seated in the midst of a bay, upon the neck of a narrow mountain, which thrusts it self into the sea, having at the uppermost end a steep high rock, so celebrated by the Poets, and hyperbolically described by Homer as unaccessible. The fables are indeed well fitted to the place, there being divers little sharp rocks at the foot of the greater: These are the dogs that are said to bark there, the waters by their repercussion from them make a noise like the barking of dogs; and the reason why Scylla is said to devour the fishes, as Homer expresses it. When stung with hunger she embroils the flood, The Sea-dog and the Dolphin are her food; She makes the huge Leviathan her prey, And all the monsters of the wat'ry way. The reason of this is, because these rocks are frequented by Lamprons, and greater fishes, that devour the bodies of the drown'd. But Scylla is now without danger, the current not setting upon it; and I much wonder at the proverb, Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim, when they stand twelve miles distant: I rather conjecture, adds he, that there has been more than one Charybdis, occasion'd by the recoiling streams: As one there is between the south end of this bay of Scylla, and the opposite point of Sicily; there the waves justling make a violent eddy, which when the winds are rough, more than threaten destruction to ships, as I have heard from the Scyllians, when seeking perhaps to avoid the then more impetuous turning, they have been driven by weather upon the not far distant Scylla. Strabo, (as Eustathius remarks) speaking of the Leontines, says, that they were an unhospitable people, Cyclopeans and Læstrigons: and adds, that Scylla and Charybdis were inhabited by robbers and murderers. From the terrible situation of those rocks, and the murders and depredation of the robbers these fictions might arise; they might murder six of the companions of Ulysses, and throw them into the sea from Scylla, which may be expressed in their being said to be swallow'd up by that monster. Bochart judges the names of Scylla and Charybdis are of Phæacian extract, the one derived from Sool, which signifies loss and ruin, the other from Chorobdam, which implies the abyss of destruction. It is highly probable that these rocks were more dangerous formerly than at these times, the violence of the waters may not only have enlarg'd their channel by time, but by throwing up banks and sands, have diverted their course from bearing upon these rocks with the same violence as antiently; add to this, that men by art may have contributed to render these seas more safe, being places of great resort and navigation. Besides, the unskilfulness of the Antients in sea affairs, and the smallness and form of their vessels, might render those seas very dangerous to them, which are safe to modern navigators. The boiling billows thund'ring roll below; Thro' the vast waves the dreadful wonders move, Hence nam'd Erratic by the Gods above. It will reconcile the Reader in some measure to the boldness of these fictions, if he considers that Homer, to render his Poetry more marvellous, joins what has been related of the Symplegades, to the description of Scylla and Charybdis: such a fiction of the justling of these rocks could not be shocking to the ears of the Antients, who had before heard of the same property in the Symplegades. The whole fable is perhaps grounded upon appearance: Navigators looking upon these rocks at a distance, might in different views, according to the position of the ship, sometimes see them in a direct line, and then they would appear to join, and after they had pass'd a little further they might look upon them obliquely, and then they would be discovered to be at some distance; and this might give occasion to the fable of their meeting and recoiling alternately. Strabo agrees that Homer borrow'd his description of Scylla and Charybdis from the Symplegades; Homer (says he) describes these, like the Cyanean rocks; he continually lays the foundation of his fables upon some well known History: Thus he feigns these rocks to be full of dangers and horrors, according to the relations of the Cyanean, which from their justling are called Symplegades, No bird of air, no dove of swiftest wing, What might give Homer this notion, might be what is related of the Symplegades. Phineus being ask'd by Jason if he could pass those rocks with safety, he desires to know how swift the vessel was; Jason answers, as swift as a dove; Then, said Phineus, send a dove between the rocks, and if she escapes, you may pass in safety: Jason complies, and the pigeon in her passage lost only her tail; that Heroe immediately sets sail, and escapes with the loss only of his rudder: This story being reported of the Symplegades, might give Homer the hint of applying the crushing of the doves to Scylla and Charybdis. You may find in Eustathius several farfetch notions upon this passage, but I shall pass them over in silence. Longinus blames it, and I have ventur'd in the translation to omit that particular which occasion'd his censure. That bears Ambrosia to th'Ætherial King, Shuns the dire rocks: In vain she cuts the skies, The dire rocks meet, and crush her as she flies; Not the fleet bark when prosp'rous breezes play, Plows o'er that roaring surge its desp'rate way; O'erwhelm'd it sinks: while round a smoke expires, And the waves flashing seem to burn with fires. Scarce the fam'd Argo pass'd these raging floods, The sacred Argo, fill'd with demigods! Ev'n she had sunk, but Jove's imperial bride A Poet should endeavour to raise his images and expressions as far as possible above meanness and vulgarity: In this respect no Poet was ever more happy than Homer: This place is an instance of it; it means no more than that while Jason made his voyage he had favourable winds and serene air. As Juno is frequently used in Homer to denote the air, he ascribes the prosperous wind to that Goddess, who presides over the air: Thus in Poetry, Juno Wing'd her fleet sail, and push'd her o'er the tide. Eustathius. Wing'd her fleet sail, and push'd her o'er the tide. High in the air the rock its summit shrouds, In brooding tempests, and in rouling clouds; Loud storms around and mists eternal rise, Beat its bleak brow, and intercept the skies. When all the broad expansion bright with day Glows with th'autumnal or the summer ray, The summer and the autumn glows in vain, The sky for ever low'rs, for ever clouds remain. Impervious to the step of man it stands, Tho' born by twenty feet, tho' arm'd with twenty hands; Smooth as the polish of the mirrour rise The slippery sides, and shoot into the skies. Full in the center of this rock display'd, A yawning cavern casts a dreadful shade: Nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow, Sent with full force, could reach the depth below. Wide to the west the horrid gulph extends, And the dire passage down to hell descends. Homer means by Hell, the regions of Death, and uses it to teach us that there is no passing by this rock without destruction, or in Homer's words it is a sure passage into the kingdom of death. Eustathius. O fly the dreadful sight! expand thy sails, Ply the strong oar, and catch the nimble gales; Here Scylla bellows from her dire abodes, Tremendous pest! abhorr'd by man and Gods! Hideous her voice, and with less terrors roar The whelps of Lions in the midnight hour. The words in the original are, ???????? ???????? which in the proper and immediate sense do not confine it to the whelps of a Lion, but to whelps in general, and perhaps chiefly of the canine kind; ???????? Eustathius interprets ?????? ?????????, or newly whelp'd, and in the latter sense the passage is understood by that Author; for he writes, ???? ???????? ?????, ?????? ?? ???? ?????; that is, “the voice of a whelp is low, but Scylla is describ'd as an huge monster;” and the Poet uses it as we do this expression; The voice of a wicked man is soft, but his deeds are mischievous and abominable. I have adventur'd to translate the words in the other sense, after most interpreters, for Homer expresses the voice of Scylla by ?????? ????????, or uttering a dreadful noise: Now what he calls her voice, is nothing but the roaring of the waves in storms when they beat against that rock; and this being very loud, is better represented by the roaring of a Lion, than the complaining of a young whelp. Chapman follows Eustathius. For here the whuling Scylla shrouds her face, That breathes a voice, at all parts, no more base Than are a newly-kitten'd kitling's cries. Which is really burlesque enough. Dacier renders the words by rugissement d'un jeune Lion, or the roarings of a young Lion. Twelve feet deform'd and foul the fiend dispreads; Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads; Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth; Jaggy they stand, the gaping den of death: Her parts obscene the raging billows hide; Her bosom terribly o'erlooks the tide. When stung with hunger she embroils the flood, The Sea-dog and the Dolphin are her food; Polybius (as Strabo remarks) contends, that Homer in all his fictions alludes to the customs of Antiquity: For instance, Scylla was a famous fishery for taking such fishes as Homer mentions: This was the manner of taking the Sea-dog; several small boats went out only with two men in it, the one rowed, the other stood with his instrument ready to strike the fish; all the boats had one speculator in common, to give notice when the fish approach'd, which usually swum with more than half of the body above water: Ulysses is this speculator, who stands arm'd with his spear; and it is probable, adds Polybius, that Homer thought Ulysses really visited Scylla, since he ascribes to Scylla that manner of fishing which is really practis'd by the Scyllians. She makes the huge Leviathan her prey, And all the monsters of the wat'ry way; The swiftest racer of the azure plain Here fills her sails and spreads her oars in vain; Fell Scylla rises, in her fury roars, At once six mouths expands, at once six men devours. Close by, a rock of less enormous height Breaks the wild waves, and forms a dang'rous streight; Full on its crown a fig's green branches rise, These particularities, which seem of no consequence, have a very good effect in Poetry, as they give the relation an air of truth and probability. For what can induce a Poet to mention such a tree, if the tree were not there in reality? Neither is this fig-tree described in vain, it is the means of preserving the life of Ulysses in the sequel of the story. The Poet describes the fig-tree loaded with leaves; even this circumstance is of use, for the branches would then bend downward to the sea by their weight, and be reach'd by Ulysses more easily. It shews likewise, that this shipwreck was not in winter, for then the branches are naked. Eustathius. Dacier gathers from hence, that the season was Autumn, meaning the time when Ulysses arrived among the Phæacians; but this is a mistake, for he was cast upon the Ogygian coast by this storm, and there remain'd with Calypso many years. The branch with which Ulysses girds his loins in the sixth book is describ'd with leaves, and that is indeed a full proof that he was thrown upon the Phæacian shores before the season in which trees shed their leaves, and probably in the Autumn. And shoot a leafy forest to the skies; Beneath, Charybdis holds her boist'rous reign 'Midst roaring whirpools, and absorbs the main, Thrice in her gulphs the boiling seas subside, Thrice in dire thunders the refunds the tide. Strabo quotes this passage to prove, that Homer understood the flux and reflux of the Ocean. “An instance, says he, of the care that Poet took to inform himself in all things is what he writes concerning the tides, for he calls the reflux ??????? or the revolution of the waters: He tells us, that Scylla (it should be Charybdis) thrice swallows, and thrice refunds the waves; this must be understood of regular tides:” There are indeed but two tides in a day, but this is the error of the Librarians, who put ???? for ???. Eustathius solves the expression of the three tides differently, it ought to be understood of the ??????????, or the space of the night and day, and then there will be a regular flux and reflux thrice in that time, or every eight hours periodically, Oh if thy vessel plow the direful waves When seas retreating roar within her caves, Ye perish all! tho' he who rules the main Lend his strong aid, his aid he lends in vain. Ah shun the horrid gulph! by Scylla fly, 'Tis better six to lose, than all to die. I then: O nymph propitious to my pray'r, Goddess divine, my guardian pow'r, declare, Is the foul fiend from human vengeance freed? Or if I rise in arms, can Scylla bleed? This short Question excellently declares the undaunted spirit of this Heroe; Circe lays before him the most affrighting danger; Ulysses immediately offers to encounter it, to revenge the death of his friends, and the Poet artfully at the same time makes that Goddess launch out into the praise of his Intrepidity; a judicious method to exalt the character of his Heroe. Dacier. Then she: O worn by toils, oh broke in fight, Still are new toils and war thy dire delight? Will martial flames for ever fire thy mind, And never, never be to Heav'n resign'd? How vain thy efforts to avenge the wrong? Deathless the pest! impenetrably strong! Furious and fell, tremendous to behold! Ev'n with a look she withers all the bold! She mocks the weak attempts of human might; O fly her rage! thy conquest is thy flight. If but to seize thy arms thou make delay, Again the fury vindicates her prey, Her six mouths yawn, and six are snatch'd away. From her foul womb Cratæis gave to air It is not evident who this Cratæis is whom the Poet makes the mother of Scylla: Eustathius informs us that it is Hecate, a Goddess very properly recommended by Circe; she, like Circe, being the president over sorceries and enchantments. But why should she be said to be the mother of Scylla? Dacier imagines that Homer speaks ænigmatically, and intends to teach us that these monsters are merely the creation or offspring of magic, or Poetry. This dreadful Pest! To her direct thy pray'r, To curb the monster in her dire abodes, And guard thee thro' the tumult of the floods. Thence to Trinacria's shore you bend your way, Where graze thy herds, illustrious source of day! This fiction concerning the immortal herds of Apollo, is bold, but founded upon truth and reality. Nothing is more certain than that in antient times whole herds of cattle were consecrated to the Gods, and were therefore sacred and inviolable: These being always of a fix'd number, neither more nor less than at the first consecration, the Poet feigns that they never bred or increas'd: and being constantly supply'd upon any vacancy, they were fabled to be immortal, or never to decay; (for the same cause one of the most famous legions of Antiquity was call'd immortal.) Eustathius informs us, that they were labouring oxen employ'd in tillage, and it was esteem'd a particular prophanation to destroy a labouring ox, it was criminal to eat of it, nay it was forbid to be offer'd even in sacrifices to the Gods; and a crime punishable with death by the laws of Solon: so that the moral intended by Homer in this fable of the violation of the herds of Apollo, is, that in our utmost necessity we ought not to offend the Gods. As to the flocks of sheep, Herodotus informs us, that in Apollonia along the Ionian gulph, flocks of sheep were consecrated to that Deity, and were therefore inviolable. Sev'n herds, sev'n flocks enrich the sacred plains, Each herd, each flock full fifty heads contains; The wond'rous kind a length of age survey, By breed increase not, nor by death decay. Two sister Goddesses possess the plain, The constant guardians of the woolly train; Lampetie fair, and Phaethusa young, From Phœbus and the bright Neæra sprung: Here watchful o'er the flocks, in shady bow'rs And flow'ry meads they waste the joyous hours. Rob not the God! and so propitious gales Attend thy voyage, and impell thy sails; But if thy impious hands the flocks destroy, The Gods, the Gods avenge it, and ye die! 'Tis thine alone (thy friends and navy lost) Thro' tedious toils to view thy native coast. She ceas'd: And now arose the morning ray; Swift to her dome the Goddess held her way. It is very judicious in the Poet not to amuse us with repeating the compliments that pass'd between these two lovers at parting: The commerce Ulysses held with Circe was so far from contributing to the end of the Odyssey, that it was one of the greatest impediments to it; and therefore Homer dismisses that subject in a few words, and passes on directly to the great sufferings and adventures of his Heroe, which are essential to the Poem. But it may not be unnecessary to observe how artfully the Poet connects this Episode of Circe with the thread of it; he makes even the Goddess, who detains him from his country, contribute to his return thither, by the advice she gives him how to escape the dangers of the Ocean, and how to behave in the difficult emergencies of his voyages: 'Tis true, she detains him out of fondness, but yet this very fondness is of use to him, since it makes a Goddess his instructor, and as it were a guide to his country. Then to my mates I measur'd back the plain, Climb'd the tall bark, and rush'd into the main; Then bending to the stroke, their oars they drew To their broad breasts, and swift the galley flew. Up sprung a brisker breeze; with freshning gales The friendly Goddess stretch'd the swelling sails; We drop our oars: at ease the pilot guides; The vessel light along the level glides. When rising sad and slow, with pensive look, Thus to the melancholy train I spoke: O friends, oh ever partners of my woes, Attend while I what Heav'n foredooms disclose, Hear all! Fate hangs o'er all! on you it lies To live, or perish! to be safe, be wise! In flow'ry meads the sportive Sirens play, Touch the soft lyre, and tune the vocal lay; Me, me alone, with fetters firmly bound, The Gods allow to hear the dangerous sound. Hear and obey: If freedom I demand, Be ev'ry fetter strain'd, be added band to band. While yet I speak the winged gally flies, And lo! the Siren shores like mists arise. Sunk were at once the winds; the air above, And waves below, at once forgot to move! Some Demon calm'd the Air, and smooth'd the deep, Hush'd the loud winds, and charm'd the waves to sleep. Now every sail we furl, each oar we ply; Lash'd by the stroke the frothy waters fly. The ductile wax with busy hands I mold, And cleft in fragments, and the fragments roll'd; Th'aereal region now grew warm with day, The wax dissolv'd beneath the burning ray; Then every ear I barr'd against the strain, And from access of phrenzy lock'd the brain. Now round the mast my mates the fetters roll'd, And bound me limb by limb, with fold on fold. Then bending to the stroke, the active train Plunge all at once their oars, and cleave the main. While to the shore the rapid vessel flies, Our swift approach the Siren quire descries; Celestial music warbles from their tongue, And thus the sweet deluders tune the song. O stay, oh pride of Greece! Ulysses stay! There are several things remarkable in this short song of the Sirens: One of the first words they speak is the name of Ulysses, this shews that they had a kind of Omniscience; and it could not fail of raising the curiosity of a wise man, to be acquainted with persons of such extensive knowledge: The song is well adapted to the character of Ulysses; it is not pleasure or dalliance with which they tempt that Heroe, but a promise of Wisdom, and a recital of the war of Troy and his own glory. Cicero was so pleased with these verses, that he translated them, lib. 5. de finibus bon. &amp; mal. O Decus Argolicum, quin puppim flectis Ulysses, Auribus ut nostros possis agnoscere cantus? Nam nemo hæc unquam est transvectus cærula cursu, Quin prius adstiterit vocum dulcedine captus; Post, variis avido satiatus pectore Musis, Doctior ad patrias lapsus pervenerit oras. Nos grave certamen belli, clademque tenemus Græcia quam Trojæ divino numine vexit, Omniaque elatis rerum vestigia terris. Homer saw (says Tully) that his fable could not be approved, if he made his Heroe to be taken with a mere song: The Sirens therefore promise Knowledge, the desire of which might probably prove stronger than the love of his country: To desire to know all things, whether useful or trifles, is a faulty curiosity; but to be led from the contemplation of things great and noble, to a thirst of knowledge, is an instance of a greatness of soul. O cease thy course, and listen to our lay! Blest is the man ordain'd our voice to hear, The song instructs the soul, and charms the ear. Approach! thy soul shall into raptures rise! Approach! and learn new wisdom from the wise. We know whate'er the Kings of mighty name Atchiev'd at Ilion in the field of fame; Whate'er beneath the sun's bright journey lies. O stay, and learn new wisdom from the wise! Thus the sweet charmers warbled o'er the main; My soul takes wing to meet the heav'nly strain; I give the sign, and struggle to be free: Swift row my mates, and shoot along the sea; New chains they add, and rapid urge the way, 'Till dying off, the distant sounds decay: Then scudding swiftly from the dang'rous ground, The deafen'd ear unlock'd, the chains unbound. Now all at once tremendous scenes unfold; Thunder'd the deeps, the smoking billows roll'd! What is to be understood by the smoke of the billows? Does the Poet mean a real fire arising from the rocks? Most of the Critics have judg'd that the rock vomited out flames; for Homer mentions in the beginning of this book, ? ????? ?? ?????????????. I have taken the liberty to translate both these passages in a different sense; by the smoke I understand the mists that arise from the commotion and dashing of the waters, and by the storms of fire, (as Homer expresses it) the reflections the water casts in such agitations that resemble flames; thus in storms literally ? Ardescunt ignibus undæ. Scylla and Charybdis are in a continual storm, and may therefore be said to emit flames, I have soft'ned the expression in the translation by inserting the word seem. Ulysses continues upon one of these rocks several hours; that is, from morning till noon, as appears from the conclusion of this book; for leaping from the float, he laid hold upon a fig-tree that grew upon Charybdis; but both the fig-tree and Ulysses must have been consumed, if the rock had really emitted flames. Tumultous waves embroil'd the bellowing flood, All trembling, deafen'd, and aghast we stood! No more the vessel plow'd the dreadful wave, Fear seiz'd the mighty, and unnerv'd the brave; Each drop'd his oar. But swift from man to man With look serene I turn'd, and thus began. O friends! Oh often try'd in adverse storms! With ills familiar in more dreadful forms! Deep in the dire Cyclopean den you lay, Plutarch excellently explains this passage in his Dissertation, How a man may praise himself without blame or envy: “Ulysses (says that Author) speaks not out of vanity; he saw his companions terrify'd with the noise, tumult, and smoke of the gulphs of Scylla and Charybdis; he therefore to give them courage, reminds them of his wisdom and valour, which they found had frequently extricated them from other dangers: This is not vain-glory or boasting, but the dictate of Wisdom; to infuse courage into his friends, he engages his virtue, prowess and capacity for their safety, and shews what confidence they ought to repose in his conduct.” Virgil puts the words of Ulysses in the mouth of Æneas. O socii, neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum, O passi graviora; dabit deus his quoque finem. Vos &amp; Scyllæam rabiem penitusque sonantes Accestis scopulos: vos &amp; Cyclopea saxa Experti, revocate animos, mæstumque timorem Mittite. Forsan &amp; hæc olim meminisse juvabit. It must be allow'd, that Virgil has improv'd what he borrows; it tends more to confirm the courage of his friends than what Ulysses speaks: Macrobius is of this opinion. Saturn. lib. 5. cap. II. Ulysses lays before his companions only one instance of his conduct in escaping dangers, Æneas mentions a second: there is something more strong in —Forsan &amp; hæc olim meminisse juvabit, than in ??? ??? ??? ????????? ???; not only as it gives them hope to escape, but as it is an assurance that this very danger shall be a pleasure, and add to their future happiness: it is not only an argument of resolution but consolation. Scaliger agrees with Macrobins, Ex ipsis periculis proponit voluptatem: nihil enim jucundius eâ memoriâ quæ periculorum evasionem, victoriamque recordatione repræsentat. Yet safe return'd—Ulysses led the way. Learn courage hence! and in my care confide: Lo! still the same Ulysses is your guide! Attend my words! your oars incessant ply; Strain ev'ry nerve, and bid the vessel fly. If from yon justling rocks and wavy war Jove safety grants; he grants it to your care. And thou whose guiding hand directs our way, Pilot, attentive listen and obey! Bear wide thy course, nor plow those angry waves Where rolls yon smoke, yon tumbling ocean raves; Steer by the higher rock; lest whirl'd around We sink, beneath the circling eddy drown'd. While yet I speak, at once their oars they seize, Stretch to the stroke, and brush the working seas. Cautious the name of Scylla I supprest; That dreadful sound had chill'd the boldest breast. Mean-time, forgetful of the voice divine, This seemingly small circumstance is not without a good effect: It shews that Ulysses, even by the injunctions of a Goddess, cannot lay aside the Heroe. It is not out of a particular care of his own safety that he arms himself, for he takes his stand in the most open and dangerous part of the vessel. It is an evidence likewise that the death of his companions is not owing to a want of his protection; for it is plain that, as Horace expresses it, Dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa Pertulit ? By this conduct we see likewise, that all the parts of the Odyssey are consistent, and that the same care of his companions, which Homer ascribes to Ulysses in the first lines of it, is visible thro' the whole Poem. All dreadful bright my limbs in armour shine; High on the deck I take my dang'rous stand, Two glitt'ring javelins lighten in my hand; Prepar'd to whirl the whizzing spear I stay, 'Till the fell fiend arise to seize her prey. Around the dungeon, studious to behold The hideous pest, my labouring eyes I roll'd; In vain! the dismal dungeon dark as night Veils the dire monster, and confounds the sight. Now thro' the rocks, appal'd with deep dismay, We bend our course, and stem the desp'rate way; Dire Scylla there a scene of horror forms, And here Charybdis fills the deep with storms. When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves The rough rock roars; tumultuous boil the waves; I doubt not every Reader who is acquainted with Homer, has taken notice in this book, how he all along adapts his verses to the horrible subject he describes, and paints the roarings of the Ocean in words as sonorous as that element. ?????? ????????????????? ?????????????????????????????, &amp;c. Subjicit rem oculis, &amp; aurium nostrarum dominus est, says Scaliger. It is impossible to preserve the beauty of Homer, in a language so much inferior; but I have endeavour'd to imitate what I could not equal. I have clog'd the verse with the roughness and identity of a letter, which is the harshest our language affords; and clog'd it with Monosyllables, that the concourse of the rough letters might be more quick and close in the pronuntiation, and the most open and sounding vowel occur in every word. They toss, they foam, a wild confusion raise, Like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze; Eternal mists obscure th'aereal plain, And high above the rock she spouts the main; When in her gulphs the rushing sea subsides, She dreins the ocean with the refluent tides: The rock rebellows with a thund'ring sound; Deep, wond'rous deep, below appears the ground. Struck with despair, with trembling hearts we view'd The yawning dungeon, and the tumbling flood; When lo! fierce Scylla stoop'd to seize her prey, Stretch'd her dire jaws, and swept six men away; Chiefs of renown! loud ecchoing shrieks arise; I turn, and view them quivering in the skies; They call, and aid with out-stretch'd arms implore: In vain they call! those arms are stretch'd no more. As from some rock that overhangs the flood, These tender and calm similitudes have a peculiar beauty, when introduc'd to illustrate such images of terror as the Poet here describes: they set off each the other by an happy contrast, and become both more strong by opposition. Eustathius remarks, that there is always a peculiar sweetness in allusions that are borrow'd from calm life, as fishing, hunting, and rural affairs. The silent fisher casts th'insidious food, With fraudful care he waits the finny prize, And sudden lifts it quivering to the skies: So the foul monster lifts her prey on high, So pant the wretches, struggling in the skie; In the wide dungeon she devours her food, And the flesh trembles while she churns the blood. Worn as I am with griefs, with care decay'd; Never, I never, scene so dire survey'd! My shiv'ring blood congeal'd forgot to flow, Aghast I stood, a monument of woe! Now from the rocks the rapid vessel flies, And the hoarse din like distant thunder dies; To Sol's bright Isle our voyage we pursue, This Isle is evidently Sicily; for he has already inform'd us, that these herds were on Trinacria, (so antiently call'd from the three promontories of Lilybæum, Pelorus, and Pachynus.) And now the glitt'ring mountains rise to view. There sacred to the radiant God of day Graze the fair herds, the flocks promiscuous stray; Then suddenly was heard along the main To low the ox, to bleat the woolly train. Strait to my anxious thoughts the sound convey'd The words of Circe and the Theban Shade; Warn'd by their awful voice these shores to shun, With cautious fears opprest, I thus begun. O friends! oh ever exercis'd in care! Hear heav'n's commands, and rev'rence what ye hear! To fly these shores the prescient Theban Shade And Circe warns! O be their voice obey'd: Some mighty woe relentless heav'n forebodes: Fly the dire regions, and revere the Gods! While yet I spoke, a sudden sorrow ran Thro' every breast, and spread from man to man, 'Till wrathful thus Eurylochus began. Homer has found out a way to turn reproach into praise. What Eurylothus speaks in his wrath against Ulysses, as a fault; is really his glory; it shews him to be indefatigable, patient in adversity, and obedient to the decrees of the Gods. And what still heightens panegyric is, that it is spoken by an enemy; who must therefore be free from all suspicion of flattery. Dacier. O cruel thou! some fury sure has steel'd That stubborn soul, by toil untaught to yield! From sleep debarr'd, we sink from woes to woes; And cruel, enviest thou a short repose? Still must we restless rove, new seas explore, The sun descending, and so near the shore? And lo! the night begins her gloomy reign, And doubles all the terrors of the main. Oft in the dead of night loud winds arise, Lash the wild surge, and bluster in the skies; Oh should the fierce south-west his rage display, And toss with rising storms the wat'ry way, Tho' Gods descend from heav'n's aereal plain To lend us aid, the Gods descend in vain: Then while the night displays her awful shade, Sweet time of slumber! be the night obey'd! Haste ye to land! and when the morning ray Sheds her bright beam, pursue the destin'd way. A sudden joy in every bosom rose; So will'd some Demon, minister of woes! To whom with grief—O swift to be undone, Constrain'd I act what wisdom bids me shun. But yonder herds, and yonder flocks forbear; Attest the heav'ns, and call the Gods to hear: Content, an innocent repast display, By Circe giv'n, and fly the dang'rous prey. Thus I: and while to shore the vessel flies, With hands uplifted they attest the skies; Then where a fountain's gurgling waters play, They rush to land, and end in feasts the day: They feed; they quaff; and now (their hunger fled) Sigh for their friends devour'd, and mourn the dead. This conduct may seem somewhat extraordinary; the companions of Ulysses appear to have forgot their lost friends, they entertain themselves with a due refreshment, and then find leisure to mourn; whereas a true sorrow would more probably have taken away all appetite. But the practice of Ulysses's friends is consonant to the customs of Antiquity: It was esteem'd a prophanation and a piece of Ingratitude to the Gods, to mix sorrow with their entertainments: The hours of repast were allotted to joy, and thanksgiving to heaven for the bounty it gave to man by sustenance. Besides, this practice bears a secret instruction, viz. that the principal care is owing to the living; and when that is over, the dead are not to be neglected. Æneas and his friends are drawn in the same attitude by Virgil: Postquam exemta fames epulis, mensæque remotæ Amissos longo socios sermone requirunt; Præcipuè pius Æneas, nunc acris Oronti, Nunc Amyci casum gemit, &amp;c. Nor cease the tears, 'till each in slumber shares A sweet forgetfulness of human cares. Now far the night advanc'd her gloomy reign, And setting stars roll'd down the azure plain: When, at the voice of Jove, wild whirlwinds rise, And clouds and double darkness veil the skies; The moon, the stars, the bright ætherial host Seem as extinct, and all their splendors lost; The furious tempest roars with dreadful sound: Air thunders, rolls the ocean, groans the ground. All night it rag'd: when morning rose, to land We haul'd our bark, and moor'd it on the strand, Where in a beauteous Grotto's cool recess Dance the green Nereids of the neighb'ring seas. There while the wild winds whistled o'er the main, Thus careful I addrest the list'ning train. O friends be wise! nor dare the flocks destroy Of these fair pastures: If ye touch, ye die. Warn'd by the high command of heav'n, be aw'd; Holy the flocks, and dreadful is the God! That God who spreads the radiant beams of light, And views wide earth and heav'n's unmeasur'd height. And now the moon had run her monthly round, The south-east blust'ring with a dreadful sound; Unhurt the beeves, untouch'd the woolly train Low thro' the grove, or range the flow'ry plain: Then fail'd our food; then fish we make our prey, Or fowl that screaming haunt the wat'ry way. 'Till now from sea or flood no succour found, Famine and meager want besieg'd us round. Pensive and pale from grove to grove I stray'd, It was necessary (remarks Eustathius) for the Poet to invent some pretext to remove Ulysses: If he had been present, his companions dar'd not to have disobey'd him openly; or if they had, it would have shew'd a want of authority, which would have been a disparagement to that Heroe. Now what pretext could be more rational than to suppose him withdrawn to offer up his devotions to the Gods? His affairs are brought to the utmost extremity, his companions murmur, and hunger oppresses. The Poet therefore, to bring about the crime of these offenders by probable methods, represents Ulysses retiring to supplicate the Gods; a conduct which they ought to have imitated: Besides there is a poetical justice observ'd in the whole relation, and by the piety of Ulysses, and the guilt of his companions, we acknowledge the equity when we see them perish, and Ulysses preserved from all his dangers. From the loud storms to find a Sylvan shade; There o'er my hands the living wave I pour; And heav'n and heav'n's immortal thrones adore, To calm the roarings of the stormy main, And grant me peaceful to my realms again. Then o'er my eyes the Gods soft slumber shed, While thus Eurylochus arising said. O friends, a thousand ways frail mortals lead To the cold tomb, and dreadful all to tread; But dreadful most, when by a slow decay Pale hunger wastes the manly strength away. Why cease ye then t'implore the pow'rs above, And offer hecatombs to thund'ring Jove? Why seize ye not yon beeves, and fleecy prey? Arise unanimous; arise and slay! And if the Gods ordain a safe return, To Phœbus shrines shall rise, and altars burn. Eurylochus puts on an air of piety to persuade his companions to commit sacrilege: Let us sacrifice, says he, to the Gods: as if obedience were not better than sacrifice. Homer understood the nature of man, which is studious to find excuses to justifie our crimes; and we often offend, merely thro' hopes of a pardon. Dacier. The word in the original is ???????? which does not signifie statues, but ornaments, ?????????, hung up, or reposited in the temples; such as ? ??????? ????? ???????? ???????. or as it is express'd in the Iliad, ? ??????? ?????? ??????. Hesychius interprets ?????? to be, ??? ??? ??? ?????????, ??? ?? ???????? ??????; that is, ?????? signifies every ornament with which a person is delighted or adorn'd; not a statue, as it is understood by the generality. Dacier, Eustathius. But should the pow'rs that o'er mankind preside, Decree to plunge us in the whelming tide, Better to rush at once to shades below, Then linger life away, and nourish woe! Thus he: the beeves around securely stray, When swift to ruin they invade the prey. They seize, they kill!—but for the rite divine, The barley fail'd, and for libations, wine. Swift from the oak they strip the shady pride; And verdant leaves the flow'ry cake supply'd. With pray'r they now address th'ætherial train, Slay the selected beeves, and flea the slain: The thighs, with fat involv'd, divide with art, Strow'd o'er with morsels cut from ev'ry part. Water, instead of wine, is brought in urns, And pour'd prophanely as the victim burns. The thighs thus offer'd, and the entrails drest, They roast the fragments, and prepare the feast. 'Twas then soft slumber fled my troubled brain: Back to the bark I speed along the main. When lo! an odour from the feast exhales, Spreads o'er the coast, and scents the tainted gales; A chilly fear congeal'd my vital blood, And thus obtesting Heav'n I mourn'd aloud. O sire of men and Gods, immortal Jove! Oh all ye blissful pow'rs that reign above! Why were my cares beguil'd in short repose? O fatal slumber, paid with lasting woes! A deed so dreadful all the Gods alarms, Vengeance is on the wing, and heav'n in arms! Mean-time Lampetiè mounts th'aereal way, And kindles into rage the God of day: Vengeance, ye pow'rs, (he cries) and thou whose hand Aims the red bolt, and hurls the writhen brand! Slain are those herds which I with pride survey, When thro' the ports of heav'n I pour the day, Or deep in Ocean plunge the burning ray. Vengeance, ye Gods! or I the skies forego, And bear the lamp of heav'n to shades below. This is a very bold fiction, for how can the Sun be imagin'd to illuminate the regions of the dead; that is, to shine within the earth, for there the realm of Pluto is plac'd by Homer? I am persuaded the meaning is only that he would no more rise, but leave the earth and heavens in perpetual darkness. Erebus is placed in the west, where the Sun sets, and consequently when he disappears he may be said to be sunk into the realms of darkness or Erebus. Perhaps the whole fiction might be founded really upon the observation of some unusual darkness of the Sun, either from a total eclipse or other causes, which happen'd at the time when some remarkable crime was committed, and gave the Poets liberty to feign that the Sun withdrew his light from the view of it. Thus at the death of Cæsar the globe of the Sun was obscur'd, or gave but a weak light, (says Plutarch) a whole year; and Plin. lib. 2. 80. fiunt prodigiosi &amp; longiores solis defectus, totius pænè anni pallore continuo. This Virgil directly applies to the horror the Sun conceiv'd at the death of Cæsar, Georg. 1. Ille etiam extincto miseratus Gæsare Romam. Cum caput obscurâ nitidum ferrugine texit, Impiaque æternam timuerunt sæcula noctem. And if Virgil might say that the Sun withdrew his beams at the impiety of the Romans, why may not Homer say the same, concerning the crime of the companions of Ulysses? Daceir imagines that Homer had heard of the Sun's standing still at the voice of Joshua; for if (says she) he could stand still in the upper region, why might he not do the same in the contrary Hemisphere, that is, in the language of Homer, bear his lamps to shades below? But this seems to be spoken without any foundation, there being no occasion to have recourse to that miraculous event for a solution. To whom the thund'ring Pow'r: O source of day! Whose radiant lamp adorns the azure way, Still may thy beams thro' heav'n's bright portals rise, The joy of earth, and glory of the skies; Lo! my red arm I bare, my thunders guide, To dash th'offenders in the whelming tide. To fair Calypso, from the bright abodes, These lines are inserted (as Eustathius observes) solely to reconcile the story to credibility: For how was it possible for Ulysses to arrive at the knowledge of what was done in heaven, without a discovery made by some of the Deities? The persons by whom these discourses of the Gods are discover'd are happily chosen; Mercury was the messenger of heaven, and it is this God who descends to Calypso in the fifth of the Odyssey: so that there was a correspondence between Calypso and Mercury; and therefore he is a proper person to make this discovery to that Goddess, and she, out of affection, to Ulysses. Hermes convey'd these councils of the Gods. Mean-time from man to man my tongue exclaims, My wrath is kindled, and my soul in flames. In vain! I view perform'd the direful deed, Beeves, slain by heaps, along the ocean bleed. Now heav'n gave signs of wrath; along the ground This passage (says Eustathius) gave an occasion of laughter, to men dispos'd to be merry, ????? ?????????? ?????? ???? ??????? ????????. He adds, that the terrors of a guilty conscience drove the companions of Ulysses into these imaginations: Guilt is able to create a phantom in a moment, so that these appearances were nothing but the illusions of a disturb'd imagination. He cites a passage from the Calliope of Herodotus to vindicate Homer: Artayctes a Persian General had plunder'd a temple in which was the tomb of Protesilaus, where great riches were deposited; afterwards he was besieg'd in Sestus, and taken prisoner: One day, one of his guards was boiling salted fishes (???????) and they leap'd, and moved as if they had been alive, and newly taken out of the water: Divers persons crouded about the place, and wonder'd at the miracle; when Artayctes said, Friends, you are not at all concerned in this miracle: Protesilaus, tho' dead, admonishes me by this sign, that the Gods have given him power to revenge the injury I offer'd to his monument in Eleus. But this is justifying one fable by another; and this looks also like the effects of a guilty conscience. This is not among the passages condemn'd by Longinus; and indeed it was no way blameable, if we consider the times when it was spoken, and the persons to whom it is related: I mean Phæacians, who were delighted with such wonders. What was said judiciously by a great Writer, may very properly be apply'd to these people, Credo, quia impossibile est. But we need not have recourse to their credulity for a vindication of this story: Homer has given us an account of all the abstruse arts, such as Necromancy, Witchcraft, and natural portents; here he relates a prodigy, the belief of which universally prevail'd among the Antients: Let any one read Livy, and he will find innumerable instances of prodigies, equally incredible as this, which were related by the wise, and believed at least by the vulgar. Thus we read of speaking Oxen, the sweating of the statues of the Gods, in the best Roman Histories. If such wonders might have a place in History, they may certainly be allow'd room in Poetry, whose province is fable: it signifies nothing whether a story be true or false, provided it be establish'd by common belief, or common fame: this is a sufficient foundation for Poetry. Virgil, Georg. 1. 475. ? Pecudesque locutæ Infandum! sistunt amnes, &amp;c. The days of wonder are now over, and therefore a Poet would be blameable to make use of such impossibilities in these ages: They are now almost universally disbelieved, and therefore would not be approv'd as bold fictions, but exploded as wild extravagancies. Crept the raw hides, and with a bellowing sound Roar'd the dead limbs; the burning entrails groan'd Six guilty days my wretched mates employ In impious feasting, and unhallow'd joy; The sev'nth arose, and now the Sire of Gods Rein'd the rough storms, and calm'd the tossing floods: With speed the bark we climb; the spacious sails Loos'd from the yards invite th'impelling gales. Past sight of shore, along the surge we bound, And all above is sky, and ocean all around! When lo! a murky cloud the Thund'rer forms Full o'er our heads, and blackens heav'n with storms. Night dwells o'er all the deep: and now out flies Longinus, while he condemns the Odyssey as wanting fire, thro' the decay of Homer's fancy; excepts the descriptions of the Tempests, which he allows to be painted with the boldest and strongest strokes of Poetry. Let any person read that passage in the 5?? Book, and he will be convinc'd of the fire of Homer's fancy. ?? ????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ?? ??????, ????? ???????? ????, ????? ?? ???????? ?????? ???????? ??????, ??? ?? ???????? ?????? ????? ???? ??? ??????. ?????? ?? ?????????? ???. The two last lines are here repeated; and Scaliger, a second Zoilus of Homer, allows them to be omnia pulchra, plena, gravia. p. 469. There is a storm in the very words, and the horrors of it are viable in the verses. Virgil was master of too much judgment, not to embellish his Æneid with this description. Insubuere mari, totumque a sedibus imis Unà Eurusque Notusque ruunt, creberque procellis Africus, &amp; vastos volvunt ad littora fluctus. Eripiunt subito nubes cœlumque diemque Teucrorum ex oculis: ponto nox incubat atra. These are almost literally translated from the above-mentioned verses of Homer, and these following. ??? ?? ????? ?? ????? ?? ?????, ??????? ?? ?????? ??? ?????? ????????????, ???? ???? ????????. Scaliger calls the Verses of Homer, divina oratio, but prefers those of Virgil. Totumque a sedibus imis, is stronger than ??????? ??????, &amp;c. and ???????????? is an ill-chosen Epithet, to be used to describe a storm, for it carries an image of serenity. But that is to be understood of the general nature of that wind: As a river may be said to be gentle, tho' capable to be swell'd into a flood. But I leave the preference to the Reader's judgment. The gloomy West, and whistles in the skies. The mountain billows roar: the furious blast Howls o'er the shroud, and rends it from the mast: The mast gives way, and crackling as it bends, Tears up the deck; then all at once descends: The pilot by the tumbling ruin slain, There is a great similitude between this passage and some verses in Virgil, in which, as Scaliger judges and perhaps with reason, the preference is to be given to the Roman Poet. Tenuissimâ, says that Critic, &amp; levissimâ utitur narratione Homerus. ????? ?????????? ???????, ??? ?? ????? ????? ????? ?????? ???????, ? ??????????? ?????? ??????? And again ? ????? ?? ?? ???? ???????? ???? ????????? ?????? ???? ??? ???????? ??????? ??????????. ? Ingens a vertice Pontus In puppim ferit. excutitur, pronusque magister Volvitur in caput. ? Ast illam ter fluctus ibidem Torquet agens circum, &amp; rapidus vorat æquore vortex, Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto. There is certainly better versification in these lines of Virgil, than in those of Homer: There is better colouring, and they set the thing they describe full before our Eyes. Virgil has omitted the two short similitudes of the Diver, and Sea-mews, despairing perhaps to make them shine in the Roman language. There is a third simile in Homer of the Bat or Bird of night ????????, which is introduc'd to represent Ulysses clinging round the Fig-tree. 'Tis true the whole three are taken from low subjects, but they very well paint the thing they were intended to illustrate. Dash'd from the helm falls headlong in the main. Then Jove in anger bids his thunders roll, And forky lightnings flash from pole to pole; Fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims, Red with uncommon wrath, and wrapt in flames: Full on the bark it fell; now high, now low, Tost and retost, it reel'd beneath the blow; At once into the main the crew it shook: Sulphureous odors rose, and smould'ring smoke. Like fowl that haunt the floods, they sink, they rise, Now lost, now seen, with shrieks and dreadful cries; And strive to gain the bark; but Jove denies. Firm at the helm I stand, when fierce the main Rush'd with dire noise, and dash'd the sides in twain; Again impetuous drove the furious blast, Snapt the strong helm, and bore to sea the mast. Firm to the mast with cords the helm I bind And ride aloft, to Providence resign'd, Thro' tumbling billows, and a war of wind. Now sunk the West, and now a southern breeze More dreadful than the tempest, lash'd the seas; For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves, And dire Charybdis rolls her thund'ring waves. All night I drove; and at the dawn of day Fast by the rocks beheld the desp'rate way: Just when the sea within her gulphs subsides, And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides. Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound, The lofty fig-tree seiz'd, and clung around. So to the beam the Bat tenacious clings, And pendent round it clasps his leathern wings, High in the air the tree its boughs display'd, And o'er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade. All unsustain'd between the wave and sky, Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly. What-time the Judge forsakes the noisy bar This passage has been egregiously misunderstood by Mons. Perrault. Ulysses being carried (says that author) on his mast toward Charybdis, leaps from it, and clings like a Bat round a Fig-tree, waiting till the return of the mast from the gulphs of it; and adds, that when he saw it, he was as glad as a Judge when he rises from his seat to go to dinner, after having try'd several causes. But Boileau fully vindicates Homer in his reflexions on Longinus: Before the use of dials or clocks the Antients distinguish'd the day by some remarkable offices, or stated employments: as from the dining of the labourer, —What-time in some sequester'd vale The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal. Iliad XI. ver. 119. See the Annotation; so here from the rising of the Judges, and both denote the Mid-day, or Noontide hour. Thus it is used by Hippocrates, who speaking of a person wounded with a Javelin in the Liver, says he dy'd ???? ?????? ???????, a little before the breaking up of the Assembly, or before the Judge rises from his tribunal; or as some understand it, a little before the finishing of the market: There is a parallel expression in Xenophon, ??? ??? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????. This rising of the Judge Perrault mistakes for a comparison, to express the joy which Ulysses conceiv'd at the sight of the return of his mast; than which nothing can be more distant from Homer's sentiment. From this description we may precisely learn the time that passed while Ulysses clung round the Fig-tree. ? At the dawn of Day Fast by the Rocks I plow'd the desp'rate way. So that at Morning he leap'd from his float, and about Noon recover'd it: Now Eustathius affirms, that in the space of twenty four hours there are three Tides, and dividing that time into three parts, Ulysses will appear to have remain'd upon the Rock eight hours. The exact time when the Judge rose from his tribunal is not apparent: Boileau supposes it to be about three a Clock in the Afternoon, Dacier about two; but the time was certain among the Antients, and is only dubious to us, as we are ignorant of the hour of the day when the Judge enter'd his Tribunal, and when he left it. To take repast, and stills the wordy war; Charybdis rumbling from her inmost caves, The mast refunded on her refluent waves. Swift from the tree, the floating mast to gain, Sudden I drop'd amidst the flashing main; Once more undaunted on the ruin rode, And oar'd with lab'ring arms along the flood. Unseen I pass'd by Scylla's dire abodes: So Jove decreed, (dread Sire of men and Gods) Then nine long days I plow'd the calmer seas, Heav'd by the surge and wafted by the breeze. Weary and wet th'Ogygian shores I gain, When the tenth sun descended to the main. This account is very extraordinary. Ulysses continued upon the Mast ten days, and consequently ten days without any nourishment. Longinus brings this passage as an instance of the decay of Homer's Genius, and his launching out into extravagant Fables. I wonder Eustathius should be silent about this Objection; but Dacier endeavours to vindicate Homer, from a similar place in the Acts of the Apostles, Cap. 27. ver. 33. where Saint Paul says to the Sailors, This is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting, having taken nothing. Now if the Sailors in the Acts could fast fourteen days, why might not Ulysses fast ten? But this place by no means comes up to the point. The words are ?????????????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????, that is, expecting the fourteenth day, (which is to-day) you continue without eating; so the meaning is, they had taken no food all that day; the danger was so great that they had no leisure to think upon hunger. This is the literal construction of the Words, and implies that out of expectation of the fourteenth Day, (which they look'd upon as a critical time when their danger would be at the highest) they had forgot to take their usual repast; and not, that they had fasted fourteen Days. But if any Person thinks that the fasting is to be apply'd to the whole fourteen days, it must be in that latitude wherein Interpreters expound Hesiod. ? ???? ?? ????? ?????? ? which signifies not that they eat no Meat at all, but that they had not leisure thro' their danger to observe the usual and stated hours of repast: They eat in their Arms, with their hands foul'd with Blood. But I take the former sense to be the better. Besides, it is impossible to make this place of any service to Homer; for if these Men continued so long fasting, it was a miraculous fast; and how can this be apply'd to Ulysses, who is not imagined to owe his power of fasting to any supernatural assistance? But it is almost a demonstration that the sailors in the Acts eat during the tempest: Why should they abstain? It was not for want of food; for at St. Paul's injunction they take some sustenance: Now it is absurd to imagine a miracle to be performed, when common and easy means were at hand to make such a supernatural act unnecessary. If they had been without food, then indeed a miracle might have been suppos'd to supply it. If they had died thro' fasting, when meat was at hand, they would have been guilty of starving themselves. If therefore we suppose a miracle, we must suppose it to be wrought, to prevent men from being guilty of wilful self-murder, which is an absurdity. Besides, the word ?????? is used to denote a person who takes no food for the space of one day only, as ????????? signifies a person who eats but one meal in the compass of one day; this therefore is an evidence, that the sailors in the Acts had not been without sustenance fourteen days. In short, I am not in the number of those who think Homer has no faults; and unless we imagine Ulysses to have fasted ten days by the assistance of the Gods, this passage must be allowed to be extravagant: 'Tis true, Homer says, the Gods guided him to the Ogygian shores; but he says not a word to soften the incredibility of the fasting of Ulysses, thro' any assistance of the Gods. I am therefore inclin'd to subscribe to the opinion of Longinus, that this relation is faulty; but say with Horace, ? Non ego paucis Offendar maculis, quos aut incuria fudit, Aut humana parum cavit natura. There in Calypso's ever-fragrant bow'rs Refresh'd I lay, and Joy beguil'd the hours. My following fates to thee, oh King, are known, And the bright partner of thy royal throne. Enough: In misery can words avail? And what so tedious as a twice-told tale? THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Arrival of Ulysses in Ithaca. Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete, and embarks in the evening. Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca; where the sailors, as Ulysses is yet sleeping, lay him on the shore with all his treasures. On their return, Neptune changes their ship into a rock. In the mean-time Ulysses awaking, knows not his native Ithaca, by reason of a mist which Pallas had cast round him. He breaks into loud lamentations; 'till the Goddess appearing to him in the form of a Shepherd, discovers the country to him, and points out the particular places. He then tells a feign'd story of his adventures, upon which she manifests her self, and they consult together of the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors. To conceal his return, and disguise his person the more effectually, she changes him into the figure of an old Beggar. He ceas'd; but left so pleasing on their ear His voice, that list'ning still they seem'd to hear. A pause of silence hush'd the shady rooms: The Epithet in the original is ????????, or gloomy: It is here used with a peculiar propriety, to keep in the Reader's mind the exact time when Ulysses made his narration to the Phæacians, namely, in the evening of the thirty third day: we may likewise gather from this distinction of times, the exact stay of Ulysses among the Phæacians; he was thrown upon their shores on the thirty first day in the evening, and lands about day break on the thirty fifth day in his own country; so that he staid three days and three nights only with Alcinous, one night being spent in his voyage to Ithaca from Phæacia. The grateful conf'rence then the King resumes. Whatever toils the great Ulysses past, Beneath this happy roof they end at last; No longer now from shore to shore to roam, Smooth seas, and gentle winds, invite him home. But hear me, Princes! whom these walls inclose, For whom my chanter sings, and goblet flows Homer calls the wine ?????????, or wine drank at the entertainment of Elders, ????????, or men of distinction, says Eustathius; by the bard, he means Demodocus. The same Critic further remarks, that Homer judiciously shortens every circumstance before he comes to the dismission of Ulysses: Thus he omits the description of the sacrifice, and the subject of the song of Demodocus; these are circumstances that at best would be but useless ornaments, and ill agree with the impatience of Ulysses to begin his voyage toward his country. These therefore the Poet briefly dispatches. With wines unmixt, (an honour due to Age, To cheer the grave, and warm the Poet's rage) Tho' labour'd gold and many a dazling vest Lie heap'd already for our god-like guest; Without new treasures let him not remove, Large, and expressive of the publick love: Each peer a tripod, each a vase bestow, A gen'ral tribute, which the State shall owe. This sentence pleas'd: Then all their steps addrest To sep'rate mansions, and retir'd to rest. Now did the rosy-finger'd Morn arise, And shed her sacred light along the skies. Down to the haven and the ships in haste They bore the treasures, and in safety plac'd. The King himself the vases rang'd with care; Then bad his followers to the feast repair. A victim Ox beneath the sacred hand Of great Alcinous falls, and stains the sand. To Jove th'Eternal, (pow'r above all pow'rs! Who wings the winds, and darkens heav'n with show'rs) The flames ascend: 'Till evening they prolong The rites, more sacred made by heav'nly song: For in the midst, with publick honours grac'd, Thy lyre divine, Demodocus! was plac'd. All, but Ulysses, heard with fix'd delight: He sate, and ey'd the sun, and wish'd the night; Slow seem'd the sun to move, the hours to roll, His native home deep-imag'd in his soul. As weary plowman spent with stubborn toil, The simile which Homer chuses is drawn from low life, but very happily sets off the impatience of Ulysses: It is familiar, but expressive. Horace was not of the judgment of those who thought it mean, for he uses it in his Epistles. ? diesque Longa videtur opus debentibus: ut piger annus Pupillis, quos dura premit custodia matrum; Sic mihi tarda fluunt, ingrataque tempora, quæ spem Consiliumque morantur, &amp;c. It was very necessary to dwell upon this impatience of Ulysses to return; it would have been absurd to have represented him cool, or even moderately warm upon this occasion; he had refused immortality thro' the love of his country; it is now in his power to return to it; he ought therefore consistently with his former character to be drawn with the utmost earnestness of soul, and every moment must appear tedious that keeps him from it; it shews therefore the judgment of Homer to describe him in this manner, and not to pass it over cursorily, but force it upon the notice of the Reader, by insisting upon it somewhat largely, and illustrating it by a proper similitude, to fix it more strongly upon our memory. Whose oxen long have torn the furrow'd soil, Sees with delight the sun's declining ray, When home, with feeble knees, he bends his way To late repast, (the day's hard labour done:) So to Ulysses welcome set the Sun. Then instant, to Alcinous and the rest, (The Scherian states) he turn'd, and thus addrest. O thou, the first in merit and command! And you the Peers and Princes of the land! May ev'ry joy be yours! nor this the least, When due libation shall have crown'd the feast, Safe to my home to send your happy guest. Compleat are now the bounties you have giv'n, Be all those bounties but confirm'd by Heav'n! This is a pious and instructive sentence, and teaches, that tho' riches were heap'd upon us with the greatest abundance and superfluity; yet unless Heaven adds its benediction, they will prove but at best a burthen and calamity. So may I find, when all my wand'rings cease, My consort blameless, and my friends in peace. On you be ev'ry bliss, and ev'ry day In home-felt joys delighted roll away; Your selves, your wives, your long descending race, May ev'ry God enrich with ev'ry grace! Sure fixt on Virtue may your nation stand, And publick evil never touch the land! His words well-weigh'd, the gen'ral voice approv'd Benign, and instant his dismission mov'd. The Monarch to Pontonous gave the sign, To fill the goblet high with rosy wine: Great Jove the Father, first (he cry'd) implore, Then send the stranger to his native shore. The luscious wine th'obedient herald brought; Around the mansion flow'd the purple draught: Each from his seat to each Immortal pours, Whom glory circles in th'Olympian bow'rs. Ulysses sole with air majestic stands, The bowl presenting to Arete's hands; It may be ask'd why Ulysses addresses his words to the Queen rather than the King; The reason is, because she was his patroness, and had first received him with hospitality, as appears from the 7?? book of the Odyssey. Ulysses makes a libation to the Gods, and presents the bowl to the Queen: This was the pious practice of Antiquity upon all solemn occasions: Ulysses here does it, because he is to undertake a voyage, and it implies a prayer for the prosperity of it. The reason why he presents the bowl to the Queen is, that she may first drink out of it, for so ????????? properly and originally signifies, ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ???? ??????, says Eustathius. Propino is used differently by the Romans. Then thus: O Queen farewell! be still possest Of dear remembrance, blessing still and blest! 'Till age and death shall gently call thee hence, (Sure fate of ev'ry mortal excellence!) Farewell! and joys successive ever spring To thee, to thine, the people, and the King! Thus he; then parting prints the sandy shore To the fair port: A herald march'd before, Sent by Alcinous: Of Arete's train Three chosen maids attend him to the main; This does a tunic and white vest convey, A various casket that, of rich inlay, And bread and wine the third. The chearful mates Safe in the hollow deck dispose the cates: Beneath the seats, soft painted robes they spread, With linen cover'd, for the Hero's bed. He climb'd the lofty stern; then gently prest The swelling couch, and lay compos'd to rest. Now plac'd in order, the Phæacian train Their cables loose, and launch into the main: At once they bend, and strike their equal oars, And leave the sinking hills, and less'ning shores. While on the deck the Chief in silence lies, And pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes. As fiery coursers in the rapid race The Poet introduces two similitudes to represent the sailing of the Phæacian vessel: The former describes the motion of it, as it bounds and rises over the waves, like horses tossing their heads in a race; and also the steddiness of it, in that it sails with as much firmness over the billows, as horses tread upon the ground. The latter comparison is solely to shew the swiftness of the vessel. The word in the original is ?????????; an instance, that four horses were sometimes join'd to the chariot. Virgil has borrow'd this comparison, Æn. 5. Non tam præcipites bijugo certamine campum Corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere currus, Nec sic immissis aurigæ undantia lora Concussere jugis, pronique in verbera pendent. It must be allow'd that nothing was ever more happily executed than this description, and the copy far exceeds the original. Macrobius, Saturnal. lib. 5. gives this as his opinion, and his reasons for it. The Greek Poet (says that Author) paints only the swiftness of the horses when scourg'd by the driver; Virgil adds, the rushing of the chariot, the fields as it were devour'd by the rapidity of the horses; we see the throwing up of the reins, in undantia lora; and the attitude of the driver, leaning forward in the act of lashing of the horses, in the words, Pronique in verbera pendent. 'Tis true, nothing could be added more elegantly than the ????? ??????????; in Homer, it paints at once the swiftness of the race, and the rising posture of the horses in the act of running; but Virgil is more copious, and has omitted no circumstance, and set the whole race fully before our eyes; we may add, that the versification is as beautiful as the description compleat; every ear must be sensible of it. I will only further observe the judgment of Homer, in speaking of every person in his particular character. When a vain-glorious Phæacian describ'd the sailing of his own vessels, they were swift as thought, and endued with reason; when Homer speaks in his own person to his readers, they are said only to be as swift as hawks or horses: Homer speaks like a Poet, with some degree of amplification, but not with so much hyperbole as Alcinous. No people speak so fondly as sailors of their own ships to this day, and particularly are still apt to talk of them as of living creatures. Urg'd by fierce drivers thro' the dusty space, Toss their high heads, and scour along the plain; So mounts the bounding vessel o'er the main. Back to the stern the parted billows flow, And the black Ocean foams and roars below. Thus with spread sails the winged gally flies; Less swift an eagle cuts the liquid skies: Divine Ulysses was her sacred load, A Man, in wisdom equal to a God! Much danger long and mighty toils he bore, In storms by sea, and combats on the shore; All which soft sleep now banish'd from his breast, Wrapt in a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest. But when the morning Star with early ray From this passage we may gather, that Ithaca is distant from Corcyra or Phæacia no further than a vessel sails in the compass of one night; and this agrees with the real distance between those Islands; an instance that Homer was well acquainted with Geography: This is the morning of the thirty fifth day. Flam'd in the front of heav'n, and promis'd day; Like distant clouds the mariner descries Fair Ithaca's emerging hills arise. Far from the town a spacious port appears, Phorcys was the son of Pontus and Terra, according to Hesiod's genealogy of the Gods; this Haven is said to be sacred to that Deity, because he had a temple near it, from whence it receiv'd its appellation. The whole voyage of Ulysses to his country, and indeed the whole Odyssey, has been turn'd into allegory; which I will lay before the Reader as an instance of a trifling industry and strong imagination. Ulysses is in search of true felicity, the Ithaca and Penelope of Homer: He runs thro' many difficulties and dangers; this shews that happiness is not to be attain'd without labour and afflictions. He has several companions, who perish by their vices, and he alone escapes by the assistance of the Phæacians, and is transported in his sleep to his country; that is, the Phæacians, whose name implies blackness, ?????, are the mourners at his death, and attend him to his grave: The ship is his grave, which is afterwards turn'd into a rock; which represents his monumental marble; his sleep means death, thro' which alone man arrives at eternal felicity. Spondanus. Sacred to Phorcys' power, whose name it bears: Two craggy rocks projecting to the main, The roaring wind's tempestuous rage restrain; Within, the waves in softer murmurs glide, And ships secure without their haulsers ride. High at the head a branching Olive grows, And crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs. Beneath, a gloomy Grotto's cool recess Porphyry has wrote a volume to explain this cave of the Nymphs, with more piety perhaps than judgment; and another person has perverted it into the utmost obscenity, and both allegorically. Porphyry (observes Eustathius) is of opinion, that the cave means the world; it is called gloomy, but agreeable, because it was made out of darkness, and afterwards set in this agreeable order by the hand of the Deity. It is consecrated to the Nymphs; that is, it is destin'd to the habitation of spiritual substances united to the body: The bowls and urns of living stone, are the body which are form'd out of the earth; the bees that make their honey in the cave are the souls of men, which perform all their operations in the body, and animate it; the beams on which the Nymphs roul their webs, are the bones over which the admirable embroidery of nerves, veins and arteries are spread; the fountains which water the cave are the seas, rivers and lakes that water the world; and the two gates, are the two poles; thro' the northern the souls descend from Heaven to animate the body, thro' the southern they ascend to Heaven, after they are separated from the body by death. But I confess I should rather chuse to understand the description poetically, believing that Homer never dream'd of these matters, tho' the age in which he flourish'd was addicted to Allegory. How often do Painters draw from the imagination only, merely to please the eye? And why might not Homer write after it, especially in this place where he manifestly indulges his fancy, while he brings his Heroe to the first dawning of happiness? He has long dwelt upon a series of horrors, and his imagination being tired with the melancholy story, it is not impossible but his spirit might be enliven'd with the Subject while he wrote, and this might lead him to indulge his fancy in a wonderful, and perhaps fabulous description. In short, I should much rather chuse to believe that the memory of the things to which he alludes in the description of the cave is lost, than credit such a labour'd and distant Allegory. Delights the Nereids of the neighb'ring seas; Where bowls and urns were form'd of living stone, And massy beams in native marble shone; On which the labours of the nymphs were roll'd, Their webs divine of purple mix'd with gold. Within the cave, the clustring bees attend Their waxen works, or from the roof depend. Perpetual waters o'er the pavement glide; Two marble doors unfold on either side; Sacred the south, by which the Gods descend, Virgil has imitated the description of this haven, Æn. lib. 1. Est in secessu longo locus, insula portum Efficit, objectu laterum, quibus omnis ab alto Frangitur, &amp;c. Within a long recess there lies a bay, An Island shades it from the rolling sea, And forms a port secure for ships to ride, Broke by the jutting land on either side, In double streams the briny waters glide. Betwixt two rows of rocks, a sylvan scene Appears above, and groves for ever green: A Grott is form'd beneath, with mossy seats, To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats; Down from the crannies of the living walls The chrystal streams descend in murmuring falls, No haulsers need to bind the vessels here, Nor bearded anchors, for no storms they fear. Dryden Scaliger infinitely prefers the Roman Poet: Homer, says he, speaks humilia humiliter, Virgilius grandiora magnifice; but what I would chiefly observe is, not what Virgil has imitated, but what he has omitted; namely, all that seems odd or less intelligible, I mean the works of the bees in a cave so damp and moist; and the two gates thro' which the Gods and men enter. I shall offer a conjecture to explain these two lines. Sacred the south, by which the Gods descend, But mortals enter at the northern end. It has been already observ'd, that the Æthiopians held an annual sacrifice of twelve days to the Gods; all that time they carried their images in procession, and placed them at their festivals, and for this reason the Gods were said to feast with the Æthiopians; that is, they were present with them by their statues: Thus also Themis was said to form or dissolve assemblies, because they carried her image to the assemblies when they were conven'd, and when they were broken up they carried it away. Now we have already remark'd, that this port was sacred to Phorcys, because he had a temple by it: It may not then be impossible, but that this Temple having two doors, they might carry the statues of the Gods in their processions thro' the southern gate, which might be consecrated to this use only, and the populace be forbid to enter by it: For that reason the Deities were said to enter, namely, by their images. As the other gate being allotted to common use, was said to be the passage for mortals. But mortals enter at the northern end. Thither they bent, and haul'd their ship to land, (The crooked keel divides the yellow sand) Ulysses sleeping on his couch they bore, There is nothing in the whole Odyssey that more shocks our reason than the exposing Ulysses asleep on the shores by the Phæacians: “The passage (says Aristotle in his Poetics) where Ulysses is landed in Ithaca, is so full of absurdities, that they would be intolerable in a bad Poet; but Homer has conceal'd them under an infinity of admirable beauties, with which he has adorn'd all that part of the Odyssey; these he has crowded together, as so many charms to hinder our perceiving the defects of the story:” Aristotle must be allow'd to speak with great judgment; for what probability is there that a man so prudent as Ulysses, who was alone in a vessel at the discretion of strangers, should sleep so soundly, as to be taken out of it, carried with all his baggage on shore, and the Phæacians should set sail, and he never awake? This is still more absurd, if we remember that Ulysses has his soul so strongly bent upon his country; Is it then possible, that he could be thus sunk into a lethargy, in the moment when he arrives at it? “However (says Mons. Dacier in his reflections upon Aristotle's Poetics) Homer was not ashamed of that Absurdity, but not being able to omit it, he used it to give Probability to the succeeding story: It was necessary for Ulysses to land alone, in order to his concealment; if he had been discover'd, the suitors would immediately have destroy'd him, if not as the real Ulysses, yet under the pretext of his being an impostor; they would then have seiz'd his dominions, and married Penelope: Now if he had been waked, the Phæacians would have been obliged to have attended him, which he could not have deny'd with decency, nor accepted with safety: Homer therefore had no other way left to unravel his fable happily: But he knew what was absurd in this method, and uses means to hide it; he lavishes out all his wit and address, and lays together such an abundance of admirable Poetry, that the mind of the Reader is so enchanted, that he perceives not the defect; he is like Ulysses lull'd asleep, and knows no more than that Heroe, how he comes there. That great Poet first describes the ceremony of Ulysses taking leave of Alcinous, and his Queen Arete; then he sets off the swiftness of the vessel by two beautiful comparisons; he describes the Haven with great exactness, and adds to it the description of the cave of the Nymphs; this last astonishes the Reader, and he is so intent upon it, that he has not attention to consider the absurdity in the manner of Ulysses's landing: In this moment when he perceives the mind of the Reader as it were intoxicated with these beauties, he steals Ulysses on shore, and dismisses the Phæacians; all this takes up but eight verses. And then lest the Reader should reflect upon it, he immediately introduces the Deities, and gives us a Dialogue between Jupiter and Neptune. This keeps up still our wonder, and our Reason has not time to deliberate; and when the dialogue is ended, a second wonder succeeds, the bark is transform'd into a rock: This is done in the sight of the Phæacians, by which method the Poet carries us a-while from the consideration of Ulysses, by removing the scene to a distant Island; there he detains us 'till we may be suppos'd to have forgot the past absurdities, by relating the astonishment of Alcinous at the sight of the prodigy, and his offering up to Neptune, to appease his anger, a sacrifice of twelve bulls. Then he returns to Ulysses who now wakes, and not knowing the place where he was, (because Minerva made all things appear in a disguised view) he complains of his misfortunes, and accuses the Phæacians of infidelity; at length Minerva comes to him in the shape of a young shepherd, &amp;c. Thus this absurdity, which appears in the fable when examin'd alone, is hidden by the beauties that surround it: this passage is more adorn'd with fiction, and more wrought up with a variety of poetical ornaments than most other places of the Odyssey. From hence Aristotle makes an excellent observation. All efforts imaginable (says that Author) ought to be made to form the fable rightly from the beginning; but if it so happen that some places must necessarily appear absurd, they must be admitted, especially if they contribute to render the rest more probable: but the Poet ought to reserve all the ornaments of diction for these weak parts: The places that have either shining sentiments or manners have no occasion for them; a dazling expression rather damages them, and serves only to eclipse their beauty. And gently plac'd him on the rocky shore. His treasures next, Alcinous' gifts, they laid In the wild olive's unfrequented shade, Secure from theft: then launch'd the bark again, This voluntary and unexpected return of the Phæacians, and their landing Ulysses in his sleep, seems as unaccountable on the part of the Phæacians, as of Ulysses; for what can be more absurd than to see them exposing a King and his effects upon the shores without his knowledge, and then flying away secretly as from an enemy? Having therefore in the preceding note shew'd what the Critics say in condemnation of Homer, it is but justice to lay together what they say in his defence. That the Phæacians should fly away in secret is no wonder: Ulysses had thro' the whole course of the eleventh book, (particularly by the mouth of the Prophet Tiresias) told the Phæacians that the suitors plotted his destruction; and therefore the mariners might very reasonably be apprehensive that the suitors would use any persons as enemies, who should contribute to restore Ulysses to his country. It was therefore necessary that they should sail away without any stay upon the Ithacan shores. This is the reason why they made this voyage by night; namely to avoid discovery; and it was as necessary to return immediately, that is, just at the appearance of day, before people were abroad, that they might escape observation. Eustathius remarks, that the Phæacians were an unwarlike nation, or as it is expressed by a Phæacian, ?? ??? ????????? ????? ???? ???? ??????? and therefore they were afraid to teach any persons the way to their own country, by discovering the course of Navigation to it; for this reason they begin their voyage to Ithaca by night, land Ulysses without waking him, and return at the appearance of daylight, that they might not shew what course was to be steer'd to come to the Phæacian shores. Plutarch in his treatise of reading the Poets, tells us, that there is a tradition among the Tuscans, that Ulysses was naturally drowsy, and a person that could not easily be convers'd with, by reason of that sleepy disposition. But perhaps this might be only artful in a man of so great wisdom, and so great disguise or dissimulation; he was slow to give answers, when he had no mind to give any at all: Tho' indeed it must be confessed, that this tradition is countenanc'd by his behaviour in the Odyssey, or rather may be only a story form'd from it. His greatest calamities rise from his sleeping: when he was ready to land upon his own country by the favour of Æolus, he falls asleep, and his companions let loose a wind that bears him from it: He is asleep while they kill the oxen of Apollo; and here he sleeps while he is landed upon his own country. It might perhaps be this conduct in Homer, that gave Horace the hint to say, ? Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus. implying, that when Homer was at a loss to bring any difficult matter to an issue, he immediately laid his Heroe asleep, and this salved all the difficulty; as in the above-mentioned instances. Plutarch is of opinion that this sleep of Ulysses was feign'd; and that he made use of the pretence of a natural infirmity, to conceal the streights he was in at that time in his thoughts; being ashamed to dismiss the Phæacians without entertainment and gifts of hospitality, and afraid of being discover'd by the suitors, if he entertain'd such a multitude: Therefore to avoid both these difficulties, he feigns a Sleep while they land him, 'till they sail away. Eustathius agrees with Plutarch in the main, and adds another reason why the Phæacians land Ulysses sleeping; namely, because they were ashamed to wake him, lest he should think they did it out of avarice, and expectation of a reward for bringing him to his own country. I will only add, that there might be a natural reason for the Sleep of Ulysses; we are to remember that this is a voyage in the night, the season of repose: and his spirits having been long agitated and fatigued by his calamities, might, upon his peace of mind at the return to his country, settle into a deep calmness and tranquility, and so sink him into a deep Sleep; Homer himself seems to give this as the reason of it in the following lines: Much danger long and mighty toils he bore, In storms by sea, and combats on the shore; All which soft sleep now banish'd from his breast, Wrapt in a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest. It must be allow'd that the last line admirably paves the way for the following account; and the Poet undoubtedly inserted it, to prevent our surprize at the manner of his being set on shore, by calling his Sleep ? a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest. How far a wise man is oblig'd to resist the calls of nature, I leave to the discussion of Philosophers; those of sleep are no more to be resisted, than those of thirst or hunger. But yet I confess Ulysses yielded unseasonably, and the strong passion and love for his Country that so fully possess'd his soul, should have given him a few hours of vigilance, when he was ready to see it after an absence of almost twenty years. Resum'd their oars, and measur'd back the main. Nor yet forgot old Ocean's dread Supreme The vengeance vow'd for eyeless Polypheme. Before the throne of mighty Jove he stood; And sought the secret counsels of the God. Shall then no more, O Sire of Gods! be mine The rights and honours of a pow'r divine? Scorn'd ev'n by man, and (oh severe disgrace) By soft Phæacians, my degen'rate race! Against yon destin'd head in vain I swore, And menac'd vengeance, ere he reach'd his shore; To reach his natal shore was thy decree; Mild I obey'd, for who shall war with thee? Behold him landed, careless and asleep, From all th'eluded dangers of the deep! Lo where he lies, amidst a shining store Of brass, rich garments, and refulgent ore: And bears triumphant to his native Isle A prize more worth than Ilion's noble spoil. To whom the Father of th'immortal pow'rs, Who swells the clouds, and gladdens earth with show'rs, Can mighty Neptune thus of man complain? Neptune, tremendous o'er the boundless main! Rever'd and awful ev'n in heav'n's abodes, Antient and great! a God above the Gods! If that low race offend thy pow'r divine, (Weak, daring creatures!) is not vengeance thine? Go then, the guilty at thy will chastise. He said: the Shaker of the earth replies. This then I doom; to fix the gallant ship I refer the Reader to the 8?? book of the Odyssey, for a further account of this transformation. Scaliger condemns it, Ulysses navis in saxum mutatur a Neptuno, ut immortalem faciat, quem odio habere debuit. But will it not be an answer to say, that it is an immortal monument of the vengeance and power of Neptune, and that whenever the story of the Vessel was mention'd, the punishment likewise must be remembred in honour of that Deity? Some are of opinion, that it is a physical Allegory, and that Homer delivers the opinion of the Antients concerning the Transmutation of one species into another, as wood into stone, by Water, that is by Neptune the God of it; according to those lines of Ovid: Flumen habent Cicones, quod potum saxea reddit Viscera, quod tactis inducit marmora rebus. But perhaps this is only one of those marvellous fictions written after the taste of antiquity, which delighted in wonders, and which the nature of Epic Poetry allows. “The Marvellous (says Aristotle in his Poetics) ought to take place in Tragedy, but much more in the Epic, in which it proceeds even to the extravagant; for the Marvellous is always agreeable, and a Proof of it is, that those who relate any thing, generally add something to the Truth of it, that it may better please those who hear it. Homer (continues he) is the man who has given the best instructions to other Poets how to tell Lies agreeably.” Horace is of the same opinion. Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet, Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum. However we must not think that Aristotle advises Poets to put things evidently false and impossible into their Poems, or gives them license to run out into wildness; he only means (as Monsieur Dacier observes) that the Wonderful should exceed the Probable, but not destroy it; and this will be effected if the Poet has the Address to prepare the Reader, and to lead him by a probable train of things that depend on miracle, to the miracle it self, and reconcile him to it by degrees, so that his Reason does not perceive, at least is not shock'd at the Illusion; thus for instance, Homer puts this Transformation into the hands of a Deity; he prepares us for it in the 8?? book, he gives us the reason of the transformation; namely the anger of Neptune; and at last he brings in Jupiter assenting to it. This is the method Homer takes to reconcile it to Probability. Virgil undoubtedly thought it a beauty, for after Homer's example, he gives us a transformation of the ships of Æneas into Sea-nymphs. I have already remark'd from Bossu, that such miracles as these ought not to be too frequent in an Epic Poem; all the machines that require Divine probability ought to be so detach'd from the action of the Poem, that they may be retrench'd from it, without destroying the action: Those that are essential to the action ought to be founded upon human probability. Thus if we take away this transformation, there is no chasm; and it no way affects the integrity of the action. A mark of vengeance on the sable deep: To warn the thoughtless self-confiding train, No more unlicens'd thus to brave the main. Full in their port a shady hill shall rise, If such thy will—We will it, Jove replies. Ev'n when with transport black'ning all the strand, The swarming people hail their ship to land, Fix her for ever, a memorial stone: Still let her seem to sail, and seem alone; The trembling crowds shall see the sudden shade Of whelming mountains overhang their head! With that, the God whose earthquakes rock the ground Fierce to Phæacia crost the vast profound. Swift as a swallow sweeps the liquid way, The winged Pinnace shot along the sea. The God arrests her with a sudden stroke, And roots her down, an everlasting rock. Aghast the Scherians stand in deep surprize; All press to speak, all question with their eyes. What hands unseen the rapid bark restrain! And yet it swims, or seems to swim, the main! Thus they, unconscious of the deed divine: 'Till great Alcinous rising own'd the sign. Behold the long-predestin'd day! (he cries) Oh certain faith of antient prophecies! These ears have heard my royal sire disclose A dreadful story, big with future woes; How mov'd with wrath that careless we convey Promiscuous ev'ry guest to ev'ry bay, Stern Neptune rag'd; and how by his command Firm-rooted in the surge a ship shou'd stand; (A monument of wrath) and mound on mound Shou'd hide our walls, or whelm beneath the ground. The fates have follow'd as declar'd the Seer. Be humbled, nations! and your Monarch hear. No more unlicens'd brave the deeps, no more With ev'ry stranger pass from shore to shore; On angry Neptune now for mercy call: To his high name let twelve black oxen fall. So may the God reverse his purpos'd will, This agrees with what Homer writes in a former part of the Odyssey, ? ???????? ??? ???? ?????, that the Gods themselves may be prevail'd upon to change their anger by prayer: a sentiment agreeable to true religion. Homer does not tell us that the last denunciation of covering the town with a mountain, was fulfilled: It is probable that it was averted by the piety of Alcinous. But (as Eustathius observes) it was artful in the Poet to leave this point doubtful, to avoid detection in deviating from true History; for should posterity enquire where this land of the Phæacians lay, it would be found to be Corson of the Venetians, and not covered with any mountain; but should this city have happened to have been utterly abolished by time, and so lost to posterity, it would have agreed with the relation of Homer, who leaves room to suppose it destroyed by Neptune. But how could Neptune be said to cover it with a mountain? had not an inundation been more suitable to the God of the Ocean? Neptune is called ???????????, and ?????????, or the Earth-shaker; earthquakes were suppos'd to be occasion'd by the Ocean, or waters conceal'd in the caverns of the ground; and consequently Neptune may tumble a mountain upon this city of the Phæacians. Nor o'er our City hang the dreadful hill. The Monarch spoke: they trembled and obey'd, Forth on the sands the victim oxen led: The gather'd tribes before the Altars stand, And Chiefs and Rulers, a majestic band. The King of Ocean all the tribes implore; The blazing Altars redden all the shore. Mean-while Ulysses in his country lay, Releas'd from sleep, and round him might survey The solitary shore, and rolling sea. Yet had his mind thro' tedious absence lost The dear remembrance of his native coast. Besides Minerva, to secure her care, The meaning of this whole passage is probably no more than that Ulysses by his long absence had forgot the face of his own country; the woods by almost twenty years growth had a different appearance; and the public roads were alter'd by so great a length of time. How then should Ulysses come to the knowledge of the place? He goes to a shepherd, and by telling him a plausible story draws it from him. This artifice is the Minerva that gives him information. By the veil of thicken'd air is meant, that Ulysses, to accomplish his re-establishment, took upon him a disguise, and conceal'd himself from the Ithacans; and this too being the dictate of Wisdom, Homer ascribes it to Pallas. The words of the original are, ? ???? ??? ????? ???????? ???????? ? which are usually apply'd by interpreters to Ulysses, and mean that the Goddess disguis'd him with this veil, that no one might know him. Dacier is of opinion that ???????? ought to be used actively; that is, the Goddess acted thus to make him unknowing where he was, not unknown to the people; for that this was the effect of the veil appears from the removal of it; for immediately upon the dispersion, The King with joy confess'd his place of birth. That the word ???????? will bear an active signification, she proves from the scholiast upon OEdipus of Sophocles. But perhaps the context will not permit this interpretation, tho' we should allow that the word ???????? will bear it. The passage runs thus: Pallas cast round a veil of air, that she might make him unknown, that she might instruct him, and that his wife and friends might not know him; for thus Homer interprets ???????? in the very next line, ?? ????? ??????. It is therefore probable, that this veil had a double effect, both to render Ulysses unknown to the country, and the country to Ulysses. I am persuaded that this is the true meaning of ????????, from the usage of it in this very book of the Odyssey: ???? ??? ?? ???????? ????? ???????? ????????. Here it can possibly signify nothing, but I will render thee unknown to all mankind; it is therefore probable, that in both places it bears the same signification. Diffus'd around a veil of thicken'd air: For so the Gods ordain'd, to keep unseen His royal person from his friends and Queen; 'Till the proud suitors for their crimes afford An ample vengeance to their injur'd Lord. Now all the land another prospect bore, Another port appear'd, another shore, And long-continu'd ways, and winding floods, And unknown mountains, crown'd with unknown woods. Pensive and slow, with sudden grief opprest The King arose, and beat his careful breast, Cast a long look o'er all the coast and main, And sought, around, his native realm in vain: Then with erected eyes stood fix'd in woe, And as he spoke, the tears began to flow. Ye Gods! (he cry'd) upon what barren coast In what new region is Ulysses tost? Possess'd by wild Barbarians, fierce in arms? Or Men, whose bosom tender pity warms? Where shall this treasure now in safety lie? And whither, whither its sad owner fly? Ah why did I Alcinous' grace implore? Ah why forsake Phæacia's happy shore? Some juster Prince perhaps had entertain'd, And safe restor'd me to my native land. Is this the promis'd, long-expected coast, And this the faith Phæacian's rulers boast? Oh righteous Gods? of all the great, how few Are just to heav'n, and to their promise true! But he, the Pow'r to whose all-seeing eyes The deeds of men appear without disguise, 'Tis his alone t'avenge the wrongs I bear; For still th'oppress'd are his peculiar care. To count these presents, and from thence to prove Their faith, is mine: the rest belongs to Jove. Then on the sands he rang'd his wealthy store, The gold, the vests, the tripods, number'd o'er: The conduct of Ulysses in numb'ring his effects, has been censur'd by some Critics as avaritious: But we find him vindicated by Plutarch in his treatise of reading the Poets: “If (says that Author) Ulysses finding himself in a solitary place, and ignorant of the country, and having no security even for his own person, is nevertheless chiefly sollicitous for his effects, lest any part might have been stol'n; his covetousness is really to be pitied and detested. But this is not the case: He counts his goods merely to prove the fidelity of the Phæacians, and to gather from it, whether they had landed him upon his own country; for it was not probable that they would expose him in a strange region, and leave his goods untouch'd, and by consequence reap no advantage from their dishonesty: This therefore was a very proper test, from which to discover if he was in his own country, and he deserv'd commendation for his wisdom in that action. All these he found, but still in error lost Disconsolate he wanders on the coast, Sighs for his country, and laments again To the deaf rocks, and hoarse-resounding main. When lo! the guardian Goddess of the wise, Celestial Pallas, stood before his eyes; In show a youthful swain, of form divine, Who seem'd descended from some princely line. A graceful robe her slender body drest, Around her shoulders flew the waving vest, Her decent hand a shining Javelin bore, And painted Sandals on her feet she wore. To whom the King. Whoe'er of human race Thou art, that wander'st in this desart place! With joy to thee, as to some God, I bend, To thee my treasures and my self commend. O tell a wretch in exile doom'd to stray, What air I breathe, what country I survey? The fruitful continent's extreamest bound, Or some fair isle which Neptune's arms surround? From what far clime (said she) remote from fame, Arriv'st thou here a stranger to our name? Thou seest an Island, not to those unknown Whose hills are brighten'd by the rising sun, Nor those that plac'd beneath his utmost reign Behold him sinking in the western main. The rugged soil allows no level space For flying chariots or the rapid race; Yet not ungrateful to the peasant's pain, Suffices fulness to the swelling grain: The loaded trees their various fruits produce, Nothing is more notorious than that an Epic writer ought to give importance and grandeur to his action as much as possible in every circumstance; here the Poet takes an opportunity to set the country of Ulysses in the most advantageous light, and shews that it was a prize worth the contest, and all the labour which Ulysses bestows to regain it. Statius is very faulty in this particular, he declaims against the designs he ascribes to his Heroes, he debases his own subject, and shews that the great labour he puts upon them was ill employ'd for so wretched and pitiful a kingdom as that of Thebes. Thebaid. lib. 1. ?Bellum est de paupere regno. But Ulysses was not King of Ithaca alone, but of Zacynthus, and Cephalenia, and the neighbouring Islands. This appears from the second book of the Iliad, where he leads his subjects to the wars of Troy. With those whom Cephalenia's Isle inclos'd, Or till'd their fields along the coast oppos'd, Or where fair Ithaca o'erlooks the floods, Where high Neritos shakes his waving woods, Where Ægilipa's rugged sides are seen, Crocylia rocky, and Zacynthus green. It is true that Ithaca contains little more than fifty miles in circuit, now call'd Val de compare; Cephalenia is larger, and is one hundred and sixty miles in circumference: Zacynthus, now Zant, is in circuit about sixty miles, unspeakably fruitful, says Sandys, producing the best oil in the world and excellent strong wines; but the chief riches of the Island consist in Corinths, which the Inhabitants of Zant have in such quantities that they know not what to do with them; for besides private gains, amounting to fifteen hundred thousand Zechins, they yearly pay forty eight thousand dollars for customs and other duties. It is impossible so little a portion of earth should be more beneficial. This observation is necessary to shew the value of Ulysses's dominions, and that the subject of the Odyssey is not trivial and unimportant; it is likewise of use to convince us, that the domestic cares and concerns of Telemachus proceeded not from meanness, but from the manners of the age; when pomp and luxury had not yet found countenance from Princes; and that when we see Eumæus, who has the charge of Ulysses's hogs, we are not to suppose him a person of low rank and fortunes, but an Officer of State, and trust: The riches of those ages consisting in flocks and herds, in swine and oxen. And clust'ring grapes afford a gen'rous juice: Woods crown our mountains, and in ev'ry grove The bounding goats and frisking heifers rove: Soft rains and kindly dews refresh the field, And rising springs eternal verdure yield. Ev'n to those shores is Ithaca renown'd, Nothing can more raise our esteem of the judgment of Homer, than such strokes of art. Here he introduces Minerva to let Ulysses into the knowledge of his country; How does she do this? She Geographically describes it to him; so that he must almost know it by the description: but still she suppresses the name, and this keeps him in a pleasing suspense; he attends to every syllable to hear her name Ithaca, which she still defers, to continue his doubts and hopes, and at last in the very close of her speech she indirectly mentions it. This discovery in my judgment is carried on with great address, and cannot fail of awakening the curiosity of the Reader; and I wonder how it could escape the observation of all the Commentators upon the Odyssey. Where Troy's majestic ruins strow the ground. At this, the chief with transport was possest, His panting heart exulted in his breast; Yet well dissembling his untimely joys, And veiling truth in plausible disguise, Thus, with an air sincere, in fiction bold, His ready tale th'inventive hero told. Oft have I heard, in Crete, this Island's name; For 'twas from Crete my native soil I came, Self-banish'd thence. I sail'd before the wind, And left my children and my friends behind. From fierce Idomeneus' revenge I flew, Eustathius observes that this relation is not consonant to antient Histories, but invented to make the disguis'd Ulysses more acceptable to the suitors, should he be brought before them: For this person whom they could not know to be Ulysses, could not fail of finding favour with them, having slain the son of Idomeneus the friend of Ulysses: And tho' it be not recorded by the Antients, yet it may be conjectur'd, that Orsilochus was thus slain, tho' not by Ulysses. If the death of Orsilochus was a story that made a noise in the world about that time, it was very artful in Ulysses to make use of it, to gain credit with this seeming Ithacan; for he relating the Fact truly, might justly be believed to speak truly when he nam'd himself the Author of it, and consequently avoid all suspicion of being Ulysses. It is observable that Ulysses is very circumstantial in his story, he relates the time, the place, the manner, and the reason of his killing Orsilochus: this is done to give the story a greater air of truth; for it seems almost impossible that so many circumstances could be invented in a moment, and so well laid together as not to discover their own falsity. What he says concerning the Phæacians leaving his effects entire without any damage, is not spoken (as Eustathius observes) in vain; he extolls the fidelity of the Phæacians, as an example to be imitated by this seeming Ithacensian, and makes it an argument that he should practise the same integrity, in not offering violence or fraud to his effects or person. 'Tis true, the manner of the death of Orsilochus is liable to some objection, as it was executed clandestinely, and not heroically, as might be expected from the valour of Ulysses: but if it was truth that Orsilochus was killed in that manner, Ulysses could not falsify the story: But in reality he is no way concern'd in it; for he speaks in the character of a Cretan, not in the person of Ulysses. Whose son, the swift Orsilochus, I slew: (With brutal force he seiz'd my Trojan prey, Due to the toils of many a bloody day) Unseen I 'scap'd; and favour'd by the night In a Phœnician vessel took my flight, The whole story of the Voyages of Ulysses is related differently by Dictys Cretensis, in his History of the war of Troy: I will transcribe it, if not as a truth, yet as a curiosity. “About this time Ulysses arriv'd at Crete with two vessels hir'd of the Phoelig;nicians: For Telamon, enrag'd for the death of his Son Ajax, had seiz'd upon all that belong'd to Ulysses and his companions, and he himself was with difficulty set at liberty. While he was in Crete, Idomeneus ask'd him how he fell into such great calamities; to whom he recounted all his adventures. He told him, that after his departure from Troy he made an incursion upon Ismarus of the Ciconians, and there got great booty; then touching upon the coasts of the Lotophagi, he met with ill success, and sail'd away to Sicily; there, Cyclops and Læstrigon two brothers used him barbarously; and at length he lost most of his companions thro' the cruelty of Polypheme and Antiphates, the sons of Cyclops and Læstrygon; but being afterwards receiv'd into favour by Polypheme, his companions attempted to carry off Arene the King's daughter, who was fallen in love with Elpenor, one of his associates; but the affair being discover'd, and Ulysses dismiss'd, he sail'd away by the Æolian Islands, and came to Circe and Calypso, who were both Queens of two Isles; there his companions wasted some time in dalliance and pleasures: Thence he sail'd to a people that were fam'd for magical incantations, to learn his future fortunes. He escap'd the rocks of the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, tho' he there lost many of his companions; then he fell into the hands of Phœnician rovers, who spar'd him; and afterwards coming to Crete, he was dismiss'd by Idomeneus with two vessels, and arriv'd at the coast of Alcinous, who being prevail'd upon by the glory of his name entertain'd him courteously: From him he learn'd that Penelope was address'd by thirty Princes; upon this, with much intreaty, he persuaded Alcinous to undertake a voyage to re-establish him in his territories; they set sail together, and concealing themselves with Telemachus 'till all things were concerted, they led their friends to the Palace, and slew the Suitors oppress'd with sleep and drowziness.” The difference between the Poet and the Historian lies chiefly in what is here said of the death of Orsilochus; Dictys tells us, that Ulysses was entertain'd like a friend by Idomeneus, and Homer writes that he slew his Son; now Idomeneus cannot be supposed to have favour'd the murtherer of his son: But this is no objection, if we consider that Ulysses speaks not as Ulysses, but in a personated character, and therefore Orsilochus must be judg'd to have fallen by the hand of the person whose character Ulysses assumes; that is, by a Cretan, and not Ulysses. Dictys is suppos'd to have serv'd under this Idomeneus, and to have wrote an History of the Trojan war in Phœnician characters; and Tzetzes tells us, that Homer form'd his Poem upon his plan; but the History now extant publish'd by Mrs. L'Fevre is a counterfeit: So that what I have here translated, is inserted not as an authority, but as the opinion of an unknown writer; and I lay no other weight upon it. For Pyle or Elis bound: but tempests tost And raging billows drove us on your coast. In dead of night an unknown port we gain'd, Spent with fatigue, and slept secure on land. But ere the rosy morn renew'd the day, While in th'embrace of pleasing sleep I lay, Sudden, invited by auspicious gales, They land my goods, and hoist their flying sails. Abandon'd here, my fortune I deplore, A hapless exile on a foreign shore. Thus while he spoke, the blue-ey'd maid began With pleasing smiles to view the god-like man: Then chang'd her form; and now, divinely bright, Jove's heav'nly daughter stood confess'd to sight. Like a fair virgin in her beauty's bloom, Skill'd in th'illustrious labours of the loom. O still the same Ulysses! she rejoin'd, In useful craft successfully refin'd! Artful in speech, in action, and in mind! Suffic'd it not, that thy long labours past Secure thou seest thy native shore at last? But this to me? who, like thy self, excell It has been objected against Homer, that he gives a degree of dissimulation to his Heroe, unworthy of a brave man, and an ingenuous disposition: Here we have a full vindication of Ulysses, from the mouth of the Goddess of Wisdom; he uses only a prudent dissimulation; he is ????????, which we may almost literally render, master of a great presence of mind: that is, upon every emergency he finds an immediate resource to extricate himself from it. If his dissimulation had been vicious, it would have been an absurdity to have introduced Minerva praising and recommending it; on the contrary, all disguise which consists with innocence and prudence, is so far from being mean, that it really is a praise to a person who uses it. I speak not of common life, or as if men should always act under a mask, and in disguise; that indeed betrays design and insincerity: I only recommend it as an instance how men should behave in the article of danger, when it is as reputable to elude an enemy as to defeat one. ? dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit. This is the character of Ulysses, who uses only such artifice as is suggested by Wisdom, such as turns to his benefit in all extremities, such as Minerva may boast to practise without a rival among the Gods, as much as Ulysses among mankind. In short, this dissimulation, in war may be called stratagem and conduct, in other exigencies address and dexterity; nor is Ulysses criminal, but artful. In arts of counsel, and dissembling well. To me, whose wit exceeds the pow'rs divine, No less than mortals are surpass'd by thine. Know'st thou not me? who made thy life my care, Thro' ten years wand'ring, and thro' ten years war; Who taught thee arts, Alcinous to persuade, To raise his wonder, and engage his aid: And now appear, thy treasures to protect, Conceal thy person, thy designs direct, And tell what more thou must from fate expect. Domestic woes, far heavier to be born! The pride of fools, and slaves insulting scorn. But thou be silent, nor reveal thy state; Yield to the force of unresisted fate, And bear unmov'd the wrongs of base mankind, The last, and hardest, conquest of the mind. Goddess of Wisdom! Ithacus replies, He who discerns thee must be truly wise, So seldom view'd, and ever in disguise! When the bold Argives led their warring powr's, Against proud Ilion's well-defended tow'rs; Ulysses was thy care, celestial maid! Grac'd with thy sight, and favour'd with thy aid. But when the Trojan piles in ashes lay, And bound for Greece we plow'd the wat'ry way; Our fleet dispers'd and driv'n from coast to coast, Thy sacred presence from that hour I lost: 'Till I beheld thy radiant form once more, And heard thy counsels on Phæacia's shore. But, by th'almighty author of thy race, Tell me, oh tell, is this my native place? It may appear somewhat extraordinary that Ulysses should not believe Minerva, who had already assur'd him that he was landed in his own country: But two answers may be given to this objection, and his doubts may be ascrib'd to his having lost the knowledge of it thro' his long absence, for that is the veil which is cast before his eyes; or to the nature of man in general, who when he desires any thing vehemently scarce believes himself in the possession of it, even while he possesses it. Nothing is more frequent than such expressions upon the Theater, and in the transport of an unexpected happiness, we are apt to think it a delusion; from hence the fears of Ulysses arise, and they are to be imputed to his vehement love of his country, not to his unbelief. For much I fear, long tracts of land and sea Divide this coast from distant Ithaca; The sweet delusion kindly you impose, To sooth my hopes, and mitigate my woes. Thus he. The blue-ey'd Goddess thus replies. How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise! Who, vers'd in fortune, fear the flatt'ring show, And taste not half the bliss the Gods bestow. The more shall Pallas aid thy just desires, And guard the wisdom which her self inspires. Others, long absent from their native place, Strait seek their home, and fly with eager pace To their wives arms, and children's dear embrace. Not thus Ulysses; he decrees to prove His subjects faith, and Queen's suspected love; Who mourn'd her Lord twice ten revolving years, And wastes the days in grief, the nights in tears. But Pallas knew (thy friends and navy lost) Once more 'twas giv'n thee to behold thy coast: Yet how could I with adverse fate engage, And mighty Neptune's unrelenting rage? Now lift thy longing eyes, while I restore The pleasing prospect of thy native shore. Behold the port of Phorcys! fenc'd around With rocky mountains, and with olives crown'd, Behold the gloomy grot! whose cool recess Delights the Nereids of the neighb'ring seas: Whose now-neglected altars, in thy reign, Blush'd with the blood of sheep and oxen slain. Behold! where Neritus the clouds divides, And shakes the waving forests on his sides. So spake the Goddess, and the prospect clear'd, The mists dispers'd, and all the coast appear'd. The King with joy confess'd his place of birth, And on his knees salutes his mother earth: Then with his suppliant hands upheld in air, Thus to the sea-green sisters sends his pray'r. All hail! Ye virgin daughters of the main! Ye streams, beyond my hopes beheld again! To you once more your own Ulysses bows; Attend his transports, and receive his vows! If Jove prolong my days, and Pallas crown The growing virtues of my youthful son, To you shall rites divine be ever paid, And grateful off'rings on your altars laid. Then thus Minerva. From that anxious breast Dismiss those cares, and leave to heav'n the rest. Our task be now thy treasur'd stores to save, Deep in the close recesses of the cave: Then future means consult—she spoke, and trod The shady grot, that brightned with the God. The closest caverns of the grot she sought; The gold, the brass, the robes, Ulysses brought; These in the secret gloom the chief dispos'd; The entrance with a rock the Goddess clos'd. Now seated in the Olive's sacred shade Confer the Heroe and the martial Maid. The Goddess of the azure eyes began: Son of Laertes! much-experienc'd man! The suitor-train thy early'st care demand, Of that luxurious race to rid the land: Three years thy house their lawless rule has seen, And proud addresses to the matchless Queen. But she thy absence mourns from day to day, And inly bleeds, and silent waftes away: Elusive of the bridal hour, she gives Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives. To this Ulysses. Oh celestial maid! Prais'd be thy counsel, and thy timely aid: Else had I seen my native walls in vain, Like great Atrides, just restor'd and slain. Vouchsafe the means of vengeance to debate, And plan with all thy arts the scene of fate. Then, then be present, and my soul inspire, As when we wrapt Troy's heav'n-built walls in fire. Tho' leagu'd against me hundred Heroes stand, Nothing is more judicious than this conduct in Homer; the whole number of suitors are to be slain by a few hands, which might shock our reason if it were related suddenly, without any preparation to shew us the probability of it: This is the intent of Homer in this and various other places of the Odyssey: he softens the relation, and reconciles us to it by such insertions, before he describes that great event. The Antients (says Eustathius) would not here allow Ulysses to speak hyperbolically; he is that Heroe whom we have already seen in the Iliad resist whole bands of Trojans, when the Greeks were repuls'd, where he slew numbers of enemies, and sustain'd their assaults till he was disengag'd by Ajax. Besides, there is an excellent moral in what Ulysses speaks; it contains this certain truth (adds Dacier) that a man assisted by Heaven, has not nly nothing to fear, but is assur'd to triumph over all the united powers of mankind. Hundreds shall fall, if Pallas aid my hand. She answer'd: In the dreadful day of fight Know, I am with thee, strong in all my might. If thou but equal to thy self be found, What gasping numbers then shall press the ground! What human victims stain the feast ful floor! How wide the pavements float with guilty gore! The words in the Greek are ??????? ?????, which Eustathius imagines to signify the land of Ithaca; for the hall even of a Palace is too narrow to be stil'd immense or ???????. But this contradicts the matter of fact, as appears from the place where the suitors were slain, which was not in the fields of Ithaca, but in the Palace of Ulysses: ??????? really signifies large or spacious; and a Palace that could entertain at one time so great a number of suitors might be call'd vast or ???????, which Hesychius interprets by ???? ?????, ?????. Dacier. It fits thee now to wear a dark disguise, And secret walk, unknown to mortal eyes. For this, my hand shall wither ev'ry grace, And ev'ry elegance of form and face, O'er thy smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread, Turn hoar the auburn honours of thy head, Disfigure ev'ry limb with course attire, And in thy eyes extinguish all the fire; Add all the wants and the decays of life, Estrange thee from thy own, thy son, thy wife; From the loath'd object every sight shall turn, And the blind suitors their destruction scorn. Go first the master of thy herds to find, There are many reasons why this injunction was necessary: The Heroe of a Poem ought never to be out of sight, never out of action: neither is Ulysses idle in this recess, he goes thither to acquaint himself with the condition of his affairs, both public and domestic; he there lays the plan for the destruction of the suitors, enquires after their numbers, and the state of Penelope and Telemachus. Besides, he here resides in full security and privacy, till he has prepar'd all things for the execution of the great event of the whole Odyssey. True to his charge, a loyal swain and kind: For thee he sighs; and to the royal heir And chaste Penelope, extends his care. At the Coracian rock he now resides, This rock was so called from a young man whose name was Corax, who in pursuit of an Hare fell from it and broke his neck: Arethusa his mother hearing of the accident hang'd her self by the fountain, which afterwards took its name from her, and was called Arethusa. Eustathius. Where Arethusa's sable water glides; The sable water and the copious mast Swell the fat herd; luxuriant, large repast! With him, rest peaceful in the rural cell, And all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell. Me into other realms my cares convey, To Sparta, still with female beauty gay: For know, to Sparta thy lov'd offspring came, To learn thy fortunes from the voice of Fame. At this the father, with a father's care. Must he too suffer? he, oh Goddess! bear Of wand'rings and of woes a wretched share? Thro' the wild ocean plow the dang'rous way, And leave his fortunes and his house a prey? Why would'st not thou, oh all-enlighten'd mind! Inform him certain, and protect him, kind? To whom Minerva. Be thy soul at rest; And know, whatever heav'n ordains, is best. To Fame I sent him, to acquire renown: To other regions is his virtue known. Secure he sits, near great Atrides plac'd; With friendships strengthen'd, and with honours grac'd. But lo! an ambush waits his passage o'er; Fierce foes insidious intercept the shore: In vain! far sooner all the murth'rous brood This injur'd land shall fatten with their blood. She spake, then touch'd him with her pow'rful wand: The skin shrunk up, and wither'd at her hand: A swift old-age o'er all his members spread; A sudden frost was sprinkled on his head; Nor longer in the heavy eye-ball shin'd The glance divine, forth-beaming from the mind. His robe, which spots indelible besmear, I doubt not but Homer draws after the life. We have the whole equipage and accoutrements of a beggar, yet so drawn by Homer, as even to retain a nobleness and dignity; let any person read the description, and he will be convinc'd of it; what can be more lofty and sonorous than this verse? ???????, ???????? ???? ??????????? ?????. It is no humility to say that a Translator must fall short of the original in such passages; the Greek language has words noble and sounding to express all subjects, which are wanting in our tongue; all that is to be expected is to keep the diction from appearing mean or ridiculous. They are greatly mistaken who impute this disguise of Ulysses in the form of a beggar, as a fault to Homer; there is nothing either absurd or mean in it; for the way to make a King undiscoverable, is to dress him as unlike himself as possible. David counterfeited madness, as Ulysses poverty, and neither of them ought to lye under any imputation; it is easy to vindicate Homer, from the disguise of the greatest persons and Generals in History, upon the like emergencies; but there is no occasion for it. In rags dishonest flutters with the air: A stag's torn hide is lapt around his reins; A rugged staff his trembling hand sustains; And at his side a wretched scrip was hung, Wide-patch'd, and knotted to a twisted thong. So look'd the Chief, so mov'd! To mortal eyes Object uncouth! a man of miseries! While Pallas, cleaving the wide fields of air, Homer is now preparing to turn the relation from Ulysses to Telemachus, whom we left at Sparta with Menelaus in the fourth book of the Odyssey. He has been long out of sight, and we have heard of none of his actions; Telemachus is not the Heroe of the Poem, he is only an under Agent, and consequently the Poet was at liberty to omit any or all of his adventures, unless such as have a necessary connection with the story of the Odyssey, and contribute to the re-establishment of Ulysses; by this method likewise Homer gives variety to his Poetry, and breaks or gathers up the thread of it, as it tends to diversify the whole: We may consider an Epic Poem as a spacious garden, where there are to be different walks and views, lest the eye should be tired with too great a regularity and uniformity: The chief avenue ought to be the most ample and noble, but there should be by-walks to retire into sometimes for our ease and refreshment. The Poet thus gives us several openings to draw us forward with pleasure; and though the great event of the Poem be chiefly in view, yet he sometimes leads us aside into other short passages which end in it again, and bring us with pleasure to the conclusion of it. Thus for instance, Homer begins with the story of Telemachus and the Suitors; then he leaves them a-while, and more largely lays before us the adventures of Ulysses, the Heroe of his Poem; when he has satisfy'd the curiosity of the Reader by a full narration of what belongs to him, he returns to Telemachus and the Suitors: at length he unites the two stories, and proceeds directly to the end of the Odyssey. Thus all the collateral and indirect passages fall into one center, and main point of view. The eye is continually entertain'd with some new object, and we pass on from incident to incident, not only without fatigue, but with pleasure and admiration. To Sparta flies, Telemachus her care. THE FOURTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Conversation with Eumæus. Ulysses arrives in disguise at the house of Eumæus, where he is received, entertained, and lodged, with the utmost hospitality. The several discourses of that faithful old Servant, with the feign'd story told by Ulysses to conceal himself, and other Conversations on various subjects, take up this entire book. We see in this book the character of a faithful, wise, benevolent old man in Eumæus; one happily innocent, unambitious, and wholly employ'd in rural affairs. The whole interview between Ulysses and Eumæus has fallen into ridicule; Eumæus has been judg'd to be of the same rank and condition with our modern swineherds. But herds and flocks were then kept and attended by the sons of Kings; thus Paris watch'd the flocks of Priam in the groves of Ida, and the same is said of many of the Heroes in the Iliad; these offices were places of dignity, and fill'd by persons of birth; and such was Eumæus, descended from a Prince, named Ctesius: Thus the Master of the Horse is a post of Honour in modern ages. It is in Poetry, as in Painting; where the artist does not confine himself to draw only Gods or Heroes, Palaces and Princes; but he frequently employs his pencil in representing Landschapes, rural scenes, groves, cottages, and shepherds tending their flocks. There is a passage in Monsieur Boileau's reflections upon Longinus, which fully vindicates all the places of Homer that have been censur'd as low and too familiar. “There is nothing, (observes that Author) that more disgraces a composition than the use of vulgar words: A mean thought expressed in noble terms, is generally more taking than a noble thought debased by mean terms: The reason is, every person cannot judge of the justness and strength of a thought, but there are very few, especially in living languages, who are not shock'd at mean words: and yet almost all writers fall into this fault. Longinus accuses Herodotus, the most polite of all the Greek Historians, of this defect; and Livy, Sallust, and Virgil have fall'n under the same imputation. Is it not then very surprizing that no reproach upon this account has fall'n upon Homer? especially, though he has composed two large Poems, and though no Author has descended more frequently into the detail of little particularities; yet he never uses terms which are not noble, or if he uses humble words or phrases it is with so much art, that as Dionysius Halicarnassus observes, they become noble and harmonious. We may learn from hence the ignorance of those modern Criticks, who judge of the Greek without the knowledge of it; and having never read Homer but in low and inelegant translations, impute the Meanesses of the Translator to the Poet. Besides, the words of different languages are not exactly correspondent, and it often happens, that an expression which is noble in the Greek cannot be render'd in a version but by words that are either mean in the sound or usage. Thus ass, and asinus in Latin, are mean to the last degree; tho' ???? in the Greek be used in the most magnificent descriptions, and has nothing mean in it; in like manner the terms Hogherd and Cowkeeper, are not to be used in our Poetry; but there are no finer words in the Greek language than ???????? and ???????: And Virgil, who entitles his Eclogues Bucolics in the Roman tongue, would have been ashamed to have call'd them in our language the Dialogues of Cowkeepers. Homer himself convinces us of the truth of this Observation; nay, one would imagine that he intended industriously to force it upon our notice: for he frequently calls Eumæus ??????? ??????, or Prince of men; and his common epithet is ????? or ???? ???????. Homer would not have apply'd these appellations to him, if he had not been a person of dignity; it being the same title that he bestows upon his greatest Heroes, Ulysses or Achilles. But he, deep-musing, o'er the mountains stray'd I shall transcribe the observation of Dionysius of Halicarnassus upon the first verses in this book: The same method, remarks that Author, makes both prose and verse beautiful; which consists in these three things, the judicious coaptation and ranging of the words, the position of the members and parts of the verse, and the various measure of the periods. Whoever would write elegantly, must have regard to the different turn and juncture of every period, there must be proper distances and pauses; every verse must be a compleat sentence, but broken and interrupted, and the parts made unequal, some longer, some shorter, to give a variety of cadence to it. Neither the turn of the parts of the verse, nor the length, ought to be alike. This is absolutely necessary: For the Epic or Heroic verse is of a fix'd determinate length, and we cannot, as in the Lyric, make one longer, and another shorter; therefore to avoid an identity of cadence, and a perpetual return of the same periods, it is requisite to contract, lengthen, and interrupt the pause and structure of the members of the verses, to create an harmonious inequality, and out of a fix'd number of syllables to raise a perpetual diversity. For instance, ????? ? ?? ??????? ??????? ???????? ???????. Here one line makes one sentence; the next is shorter, ????? ??? ??????? ? The next is still shorter, ? ??? ?????? ? The next sentence composes two Hemystics, ? ? ?? ????? ??????? ???? ??????? ? and is entirely unlike any of the preceding periods. ? ? ?? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ????????. Here again the sentence is not finish'd with the former verse, but breaks into the fourth line; and lest we should be out of breath with the length of the sentence, the period and the verse conclude together at the end of it. Then Homer begins a new sentence, and makes it pause differently from any of the former. ??? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ???? ?????? ? Then he adds, ? ???? ?? ???? ????? ??????? ? This is perfectly unequal to the foregoing period, and the pause of the sentence is carry'd forward into the second verse; and what then follows is neither distinguished by the pauses nor parts periodically, but almost at every word there is a stop. ? ?????????? ??? ????, ??????, ????????. No doubt but Homer was a perfect master of numbers; a man can no more be a Poet than a Musician, without a good ear, as we usually express it. 'Tis true, that versification is but the Mechanism of Poetry, but it sets off good sense to the best advantage, 'tis a colouring that enlivens the portrait, and makes even a beauty more agreeable. I will conclude this note, with observing what Mr. Dryden says of these two lines from Cowper's Hill, Tho' deep, yet clear, tho' gentle, yet not dull, Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full. “There are few (says he) who make verses, that have observ'd the sweetness of these lines, and fewer who can find the reason of it.” But I believe no one will be at a loss to solve the difficulty who considers this observation of Dionysius: and I doubt not but the chief sweetness arises from the judicious and harmonious pauses of the several periods of the verses; not to mention the happy choice of the words, in which there is scarce one rough consonant, many liquids, and those liquids soften'd with a multitude of vowels. Thro' mazy thickets of the woodland shade, And cavern'd ways, the shaggy coast along, With cliffs. and nodding forests over-hung. Eumæus at his Sylvan lodge he sought, A faithful servant, and without a fault. Ulysses found him, busied as he sate Before the threshold of his rustic gate; Around the mansion in a circle shone A rural Portico of rugged stone: (In absence of his Lord, with honest toil His own industrious hands had rais'd the pile) The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries born, Encircled with a fence of native thorn, And strong with pales, by many a weary stroke Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak; Frequent and thick. Within the space were rear'd Twelve ample cells, the lodgments of his herd. Full fifty pregnant females each contain'd; The males without (a smaller race) remain'd; Doom'd to supply the Suitors wastful feast, A stock by daily luxury decreast; Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend, Four savage dogs, a watchful guard, attend. Here sate Eumæus, and his cares apply'd I doubt not but this employment of Eumæus has been another cause of the mean character that has been form'd of his condition: But this mistake arises from our judging of the dignity of men from the employments they follow'd three thousand years past, by the notions we have of those employments at present; and because they are now only the occupation of the vulgar, we imagine that they were so formerly: Kings and Princes in the earlier ages of the world labour'd in arts and occupations, and were above nothing that tended to promote the conveniencies of life; they perform'd that with their own hands, which we now perform by those of our servants: If this were not so, the cookery of Achilles in the Iliad would equally disparage that Heroe, as this employment would disgrace Eumæus in the Odyssey: Arts were then in their infancy, and were honourable to the practisers: Thus Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, as skilfully as a Shipwright. Besides, even at this day Arts are in high esteem in the oriental world, and are practis'd by the greatest personages. Every man in Turky is of some trade; Sultan Achmet was a maker of Ivory Rings, which the Turks wear upon their thumbs when they shoot their arrows, and in this occupation he work'd several hours daily; and another of their Emperors was depos'd, because he refus'd to work in his occupation. It must be confessed that our Translations have contributed to give those who are unacquainted with the Greek, a mean Idea of Eumæus. This place is thus render'd by two of his Translators. Himself there sate ord'ring a pair of brogues, Of a py'd bullock's skin— Himself was leather to his foot applying, Made of a good cow-hide well coloured. Whereas Homer is as lofty and harmonious, as these are flat and inelegant. ????? ?? ???? ???????? ???? ???????? ?????? ?????? ????? ??????, ???????. 'Tis true, a Translator in such places as these has an hard task; a language like the Greek, which is always flowing, musical, and sonorous, is very difficult to be imitated in other tongues, especially where the corresponding words are not equally significant and graceful. In short, the Reader is to consider this whole description as a true picture of antient life; and then he will not sail of the pleasure of knowing how the great men of antient times passed their lives, and how those Heroes, who perform'd such noble parts on the publick stage of life, acted in private when withdrawn from notice and observation. Those ages retain'd an universal simplicity of manners: Telemachus and Eumæus have both dogs for their attendants; nay, and in later times, before luxury prevail'd among the Romans, we read of a Dictator brought from the plough, to lead the bravest soldiers in the world to conquer it. To form strong buskins of well-season'd hyde. Of four assistants who his labours share, Three now were absent on the rural care; The fourth drove victims to the suitor-train: But he, of antient faith, a simple swain, Sigh'd, while he furnish'd the luxurious board, And wearied heav'n with wishes for his Lord. Soon as Ulysses near th'enclosure drew, With open mouths the furious mastives flew: Down sate the Sage; and cautious to withstand, Homer has been censur'd for representing his Heroe unworthily: Is it probable that he who had met whole armies in battle, should now throw away his staff out of fear of a dog? that he should abandon his defence by casting himself on the ground, and leave himself to his mercy? But Eustathius fully vindicates Ulysses. It is a natural defence to avert the fury of a dog, to cast away our weapons, to show that we intend him no violence. Pliny has the like observation in the eighth book of his Natural History: Impetus canum &amp; sævitia mitigatur ab homine, humi considente. All that Homer says of the dogs, is imitated by Theocritus, Idyll. 25. v. 68. ????????? ?? ???????? ????????? ??????? ????? ???? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?????? ????? ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ??????????, &amp;c. What Homer speaks of Ulysses, Theocritus applies to Hercules; a demonstration that he thought it to be a picture of Nature, and therefore inferred it in that Heroic Idyllium. Let fall th'offensive truncheon from his hand. Sudden, the master runs; aloud he calls; This is thought to be an adventure that really happen'd to the Poet himself; it is related in the life of Homer ascrib'd to Herodotus. Thestorides having persuaded Homer to permit him to transcribe his verses, he immediately remov'd to Chios, and proclaim'd himself the Author: Homer being inform'd of it, set sail for Chios, and landing near it, he was in danger of being torn in pieces by the dogs of Glaucus, who protected him, and received him hospitably: The Poet in return labour'd to reward his kindness, by relating to him the most curious of his adventures that had happen'd in the course of his voyages. When therefore (adds Dacier) we see Ulysses entertain'd by Eumæus, we have the satisfaction of imagining we see Homer himself in discourse with his courteous friend Glaucus. And from his hasty hand the leather falls; With show'rs of stones he drives them far away; The scatt'ring dogs around at distance bay. Unhappy stranger! (thus the faithful swain The words in the Greek are ???? ???????, literally render'd, the divine swineherd, which are Burlesque in modern languages, and would have been no less in Greek, if the person of Eumæus had not been honourable, and his office a station of dignity: For the sole reason why such a translation would now be ridiculous, is because such employments are now fall'n into contempt. Let any person ask this question, Would Homer have apply'd the epithet divine to a modern swineherd? If he would not, it is an evidence that Eumæus was a man of consequence, and his post a place of honour; otherwise Homer would have been guilty of burlesquing his own Poetry. Dacier very well remarks, that the words Eumæus here speaks, and indeed his whole conversation, shew him to be a person of a good education, and of noble and pious sentiments: he discovers a natural and flowing Eloquence, and appears to be a man of great humanity and wisdom. There is a peculiarity in Homer's manner of apostrophizing Eumæus, and speaking of him in the second person; it is generally apply'd by that Poet only to men of account and distinction, and by it the Poet, as it were, addresses them with respect; thus in the Iliad he introduces Menelaus. ???? ?????, ???????, ???? ????????. ? ????? ???????? ????????. This enlivens the diction, and awakens the attention of the Reader. Eustathius observes that Eumæus is the only person of whom Homer thus speaks in the whole Odyssey: No doubt (continues that Author) he does it out of love of this benevolent old servant of Ulysses, and to honour and distinguish his fidelity. Began with accent gracious and humane) What sorrow had been mine, if at my gate Thy rev'rend age had met a shameful fate? Enough of woes already have I known; Enough my master's sorrows, and my own. While here, (ungrateful task!) his herds I feed, Ordain'd for lawless rioters to bleed; Perhaps supported at another's board, Far from his country roams my hapless Lord! Or sigh'd in exile forth his latest breath, Now cover'd with th'eternal shade of death! But enter this my homely roof, and see Our woods not void of hospitality. Then tell me whence thou art? and what the share Of woes and wand'rings thou wert born to bear? He said, and seconding the kind request, With friendly step precedes his unknown guest. A shaggy goat's soft hyde beneath him spread, And with fresh rushes heap'd an ample bed. Joy touch'd the Hero's tender soul, to find So just reception from a heart so kind: And oh, ye Gods! with all your blessings grace (He thus broke forth) this Friend of Human race! The swain reply'd. It never was our guise To slight the poor, or aught humane despise. This passage contains an admirable lecture of Morality and Humanity. The person who best understood the beauty of it, and best explain'd the precepts it comprehends, was Epictetus, from whom Monsieur Dacier furnishes us with this explication from Arrian: “Keep (says that Author) continually in thy memory, what Eumæus speaks in Homer to the disguis'd Ulysses.” O friend, it is unlawful to despise the stranger; speak thus to thy brother, father, and neighbour: It is my duty to use you with benevolence, tho' your circumstances were meaner than they are; for you come from God. Here we see Epictetus borrowing his Morality from Homer; and Philosophy embellish'd with the ornaments of Poetry. Indeed there is scarce any writer of name among all the Antients that has not been obliged to Homer, whether Moralists, Poets, Philosophers, or Legislators. For Jove unfolds our hospitable door, 'Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor. Little, alas! is all the good I can, A man opprest, dependant, yet a man: Accept such treatment as a swain affords, Slave to the insolence of youthful Lords! Far hence is by unequal Gods remov'd That man of bounties, loving and belov'd! To whom whate'er his slave enjoys is ow'd, This passage has been greatly mistaken by almost all who have translated Homer: the words at first view seem to imply that Ulysses had given Eumæus a wife, a house, and an inheritance; but this is not the meaning. The words are thus to be render'd, “Ulysses (says Eumæus) greatly loved me, and gave me a possession, and such things as an indulgent Master gives a faithful servant; namely a wife, inheritance, and an house:” These gifts are to be apply'd to ???? ???????, and not to Ulysses, and the sentence means that it is the custom of good Kings in that manner to reward their faithful servants. It is very evident from Homer, that Ulysses had not yet given a Wife to Eumæus, for he promises him and Philætius all these rewards, lib. 21. of the Odyssey. ?????? ?????????? ???????, ??? ??????? ??????, ????? ?? ????? ????? ?????????, ??? ??? ?????? ????????? ????? ??, ????????? ?? ???????. It appears therefore that Eumæus was not married, and therefore this whole period is to be apply'd to the word ????, and not to Ulysses. Eustathius. I will only add that in the above-mentioned verses Ulysses promises that Eumæus shall be the companion and brother of Telemachus; an instance, that he was not a vulgar person whom Ulysses thus honours, by making him ally'd to the Royal Family. And more, had Fate allow'd, had been bestow'd: But Fate condemn'd him to a foreign shore! Much have I sorrow'd, but my master more. Now cold he lies, to death's embrace resign'd: Ah perish Helen! perish all her kind! For whose curs'd cause, in Agamemnon's name, He trod so fatally the paths of Fame. His vest succinct then girding round his waste, Forth rush'd the swain with hospitable haste, Strait to the lodgments of his herd he run, Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun; Of two, his cutlace launch'd the spouting blood; These quarter'd, sing'd, and fix'd on forks of wood, All hasty on the hissing coals he threw; And smoaking back the tasteful viands drew, Broachers and all; then on the board display'd The ready meal before Ulysses lay'd. (With flour imbrown'd) next mingled wine yet new, We find here a custom of Antiquity: This flour was made of parch'd corn; when the Antients fed upon any thing that had not been offer'd in sacrifice, they sprinkled it with flour, which was used instead of the hallow'd barley, with which they consecrated their victims. I doubt not, (since some honours were paid to the Gods in all feasts) but that this sprinkling of flour by Eumæus was an act of religion. Dacier. And luscious as the Bee's nectareous dew: Then sate companion of the friendly feast, With open look, and thus bespoke his guest. Take with free welcome what our hands prepare, Such food as falls to simple servant's share; The best our Lords consume; those thoughtless Peers, Rich without bounty, guilty without fears! Yet sure the Gods their impious acts detest, And honour justice and the righteous breast. Pyrates and conquerors, of harden'd mind, The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind, To whom offending men are made a prey When Jove in vengeance gives a land away; Ev'n these, when of their ill-got spoils possess'd, Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast; Some voice of God close whisp'ring from within, “Wretch! this is villany, and this is sin.” But these, no doubt, some oracle explore, That tells, the great Ulysses is no more. Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise: Constant as Jove the night and day bestows, Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows. None match'd this hero's wealth, of all who reign O'er the fair Islands of the neighb'ring main, Nor all the monarchs whose far-dreaded sway The wide-extended continents obey: First on the main land, of Ulysses' breed Twelve herds, twelve flocks, on Ocean's margin feed; I have already remark'd that Ulysses was a wealthy King, and this place is an instance of it. He is master of twelve herds of Oxen, which probably amounted to fourteen thousand four hundred head; for if we count the herds by the same way of computation as the droves of swine, they will make that number, each drove consisting of twelve hundred: for tho' Homer mentions but three hundred and sixty boars, yet he tells us, the reason why they were inferior to the females was because of the luxury of the Suitors. If this be allow'd, then he had likewise the same number of sheep, and as many hogs: for Eumæus had the charge only of one herd, eleven more were under the care of other officers: Ulysses likewise had thirteen thousand two hundred goats. This will appear to be a true calculation from the words of Homer, who tells us that twenty of the greatest Heroes of the age were not so wealthy as Ulysses. The old Poets and Historians to express a person of great riches gave him the epithet of ?????????, ?????????, or ??????????; that is, “a person that had a great number of sheep or cattle, or a person of great wealth.” This is likewise evident from the holy Scriptures: David had his Officers, like Ulysses, to attend his flocks and herds: Thus I Chron. xxvii. Jehonathan was set over his treasures in the field, cities and villages; Shimei over his vineyards; Zabdi over his wines; Baal hanan over his olive trees, and Joash over his oil: He had herdsmen that had charge over his cattle, sheep, camels and asses. It was by cattle that the antient Kings enrich'd themselves from the earliest ages: Thus no less a person than Pharaoh, a powerful King of Ægypt, gave Joseph leave to appoint his brethren to be Rulers over his cattle; and we read in all the Greek Poets, that the wealth of Kings originally consisted in herds and flocks. They lose much of the pleasure of Homer who read him only as a Poet: he gives us an exact Image of antient life, their manners, customs, laws, and Politics; and it must double our satisfaction, when we consider that in reading Homer we are reading the most antient Author in the world, except the great Lawgiver Moses. As many stalls for shaggy goats are rear'd; As many lodgments for the tusky herd; Those foreign keepers guard: and here are seen Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green; To native pastors is their charge assign'd, And mine the care to feed the bristly kind: Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd, All to the suitors wastful board preferr'd. Thus he, benevolent; his unknown guest With hunger keen devours the sav'ry feast; While schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast. Silent and thoughtful while the board he ey'd, Eumæus pours on high the purple tide; The King with smiling looks his joy exprest, And thus the kind inviting host addrest, Say now, what man is he, the man deplor'd, So rich, so potent, whom you stile your Lord? Late with such affluence and possessions blest, And now in honor's glorious bed at rest. Whoever was the warrior, he must be To Fame no stranger, nor perhaps to me; Who (so the Gods, and so the Fates ordain'd) Have wander'd many a sea, and many a land. Small is the faith, the Prince and Queen ascribe (Reply'd Eumæus) to the wand'ring tribe. For needy strangers still to flatt'ry fly, And want too oft betrays the tongue to lye. Each vagrant traveller that touches here, Deludes with fallacies the royal ear, To dear remembrance makes his image rise, And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes. Such thou may'st be. But he whose name you crave Moulders in earth, or welters on the wave, Or food for fish, or dogs, his reliques lie, Or torn by birds are scatter'd thro' the sky. So perish'd he: and left (for ever lost) Much woe to all, but sure to me the most. So mild a master never shall I find: Less dear the parents whom I left behind, Less soft my mother, less my father kind. Not with such transport wou'd my eyes run o'er, Again to hail them in their native shore, As lov'd Ulysses once more to embrace, Restor'd and breathing in his natal place. That name, for ever dread, yet ever dear, Eustathius excellently explains the sentiment of Eumæus, which is full of tenderness and humanity. I will not call Ulysses, cries Eumæus, by the name of Ulysses, for from strangers he receives that appellation; I will not call him my Master, for as such he never was toward me; I will then call him Brother, for he always used me with the tenderness of a brother. ?????? properly signifies an elder brother. What I would further observe is the wonderful art of Homer in exalting the character of his Heroe: He is the bravest and the best of men, good in every circumstance of life: Valiant in war, patient in adversity, a kind father, husband, and master, as well as a mild and merciful King: By this conduct the Poet deeply engages our affections in the good or ill fortune of the Heroe: He makes himself master of our passions, and we rejoice or grieve at his success or calamity through the whole Odyssey. Ev'n in his absence I pronounce with fear; In my respect he bears a Prince's part, But lives a very Brother in my heart. Thus spoke the faithful swain, and thus rejoin'd The Master of his grief, the man of patient mind. Ulysses, friend! shall view his old abodes, (Distrustful as thou art) nor doubt the Gods. Nor speak I rashly but with faith averr'd, And what I speak attesting heav'n has heard. If so, a cloak and vesture be my meed; 'Till his return, no title shall I plead, Tho' certain be my news, and great my need. Whom Want itself can force untruths to tell, My soul detests him as the gates of hell. Thou first be witness, hospitable Jove! And ev'ry God inspiring social love! And witness ev'ry houshold pow'r that waits Guard of these fires, and angel of these gates! Ere the next moon increase, or this decay, These verses have been thought to be used ænigmatically by Ulysses. ??? ?? ????? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ?????/???, ??? ??? ????????? ?????, ??? ?? ??????????. In the former verse Eustathius tells us there is a various reading, and judges that it ought to be written ??? ?? ?? ???, and not ??? ?? ?????; and it must be allow'd that the repetition of ??? gives a greater emphasis to the words, and agrees better with the vehemence of the speaker in making his asseveration. The latter verse in the obvious sense seems to mean that Ulysses would return in the space of a month, and so Eumæus understood it; but in reality it means in the compass of a day. Solon was the first who discover'd the latent sense of it, as Plutarch informs us; “Solon, says that Author, observing the inequality of the months, and that the Moon neither agreed with the rising or setting of the Sun, but that often in the same day she overtook and went before it, nam'd that same day ??? ??? ???, the old and new Moon; and allotted that part of the day that preceded the Conjunction, to the old Moon, and the other part of it to the new: from hence we may judge that he was the first that comprehended the sense of this verse of Homer, ??? ??? ????????? ?????, ??? ?? ??????????. Accordingly he nam'd the following day, the day of the new Moon. Ulysses then means that he will return on the last day of the month, for on that day the Moon is both old and new; that is, she finishes one month, and begins another.” This is taken from the life of Solon; but whether the obvious sense in which Eumæus is suppos'd to understand it, or the latent meaning of Solon be preferable, is submitted to the Reader's judgment; I confess I see no occasion to have recourse to that mysterious explication: What Ulysses intended was to certifie Eumæus, that Ulysses would assuredly return very speedily; and the verse will have this effect, if it be understood literally and plainly; besides, Ulysses is to continue in an absolute disguise, why then should he endanger a discovery, by using an ambiguous sentence, which might possibly be understood? but if it was so dark that it was utterly unintelligible to Eumæus, then it is used in vain, and a needless ambiguity. His antient realms Ulysses shall survey, In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn, And the lost glories of his house return. Nor shall that meed be thine, nor ever more Shall lov'd Ulysses hail this happy shore, (Reply'd Eumæus:) To the present hour Now turn thy thought, and joys within our pow'r. From sad reflection let my soul repose; The name of him awakes a thousand woes. But guard him Gods! and to these arms restore! Not his true consort can desire him more; Not old Laertes, broken with despair; Not young Telemachus, his blooming heir. Alas, Telemachus! my sorrows flow Afresh for thee, my second cause of woe! Like some fair plant set by a heav'nly hand, He grew, he flourish'd, and he blest the land; In all the youth his father's image shin'd, Bright in his person, brighter in his mind. What man, or God, deceiv'd his better sense, Far on the swelling seas to wander hence? To distant Pylos hapless is he gone, To seek his father's fate, and find his own! For traytors wait his way, with dire design To end at once the great Arcesian line. But let us leave him to their wills above; The fates of men are in the hand of Jove. And now, my venerable guest! declare Your name, your parents, and your native air? Sincere from whence begun your course relate, And to what ship I owe the friendly freight? Thus he: and thus (with prompt invention bold) The cautious Chief his ready story told. On dark reserve what better can prevail, Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale, Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place Confer, and wines and cates the table grace; But most, the kind inviter's chearful face? Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown'd, 'Till the whole circle of the year goes round; Not the whole circle of the year wou'd close My long narration of a life of woes. But such was Heav'n's high will! Know then I came This whole narration is a notable instance of that artful dissimulation so remarkable in the character of Ulysses, and an evidence that Homer excellently sustains it thro' the whole Poem; for Ulysses appears to be ??????????, as he is represented in the first line, throughout the Odyssey. This narrative has been both prais'd and censur'd by the Critics, especially by Rapin; I will lay his observations before the reader. “Homer is guilty of verbosity, and of a tedious prolix manner of speaking: he is the greatest talker of all Antiquity: The very Greeks, tho' chargeable with an excess this way above all Nations, have reprehended Homer for his intemperance of words; he is ever upon his Rehearsals, and not only of the same words, but of the same things, and consequently is in a perpetual circle of repetitions. 'Tis true he always speaks naturally, but then he always speaks too much: His adventures in Ægypt, which he relates to Eumæus, are truly idle impertinent stories, purely for amusement: there is no thread in his discourse, nor does it seem to tend to any propos'd end, but exceeds all bounds: that vast fluency of speech, and those mighty overflowings of fancy, make him shoot beyond the mark. Hence his draughts are too accurate, and leave nothing to be perform'd by the imagination of the Reader, a fault which (as Cicero observes) Apelles found in the antient Painters.” This objection is intended only against the fulness of Homer's expression, not against the subject of the Narration: for Rapin in another place speaking of the beauties of Homer, gives this very Story as an instance of his excellency: these are his words, “I shall say nothing of all the Relations which Ulysses makes to Eumæus upon his return to his Country, and his wonderful management to bring about his Re-establishment; that whole story is drest in colours so decent, and at the same time so noble, that Antiquity can hardly match any part of the Narration. If what Rapin remarks in the latter Period be true, Homer will easily obtain a pardon for the fault of prolixity, imputed to him in the aforemention'd objection. For who would be willing to retrench one of the most decent and noble narrations of Antiquity, meerly for the length of it? But it may, perhaps, be true that this story is not impertinent, but well suited to carry on the design of Ulysses, and consequently tends to a propos'd End: for in this consists the strength of Rapin's objection. Nothing is more evident than that the whole success of Ulysses depends upon his disguise; a discovery would be fatal to him, and at once give a single unassisted person into the power of his enemies. How then is this Disguise to be carried on? especially when Ulysses in person is required to give an account of his own story? Must it not be by assuming the name of another person, and giving a plausible relation of his life, fortunes, and calamities, that brought him to a strange country, where he has no acquaintance or friend? This obliges him to be circumstantial, nothing giving a greater air of probability than descending to particularities, and this necessitates his prolixity. The whole relation is comprehended in the compass of an hundred and seventy lines: and an Episode of no greater length may not perhaps deserve to be called verbose, if compar'd with the length of the Odyssey: Nay, there may be a reason given why it ought to be of a considerable length: There is a pause in the action, while Minerva passes from Ithaca, to Telemachus in Lacedæmon: This interval is to be fill'd up with some incident relating to Ulysses, until Telemachus is prepar'd to return; for his assistance is necessary to re-establish the affairs of Ulysses. This then is a time of leisure, and the Poet fills it up with the narrations of Ulysses till the return of Telemachus, and consequently there is room for a long relation. Besides (remarks Eustathius) Homer interests all men of all ages in the story, by giving us pieces of true history, antient customs, and exact descriptions of persons and places, instructive and delightful to all the world, and these incidents are adorn'd with all the embellishments of Eloquence and Poetry. From sacred Crete, and from a Sire of Fame: Castor Hylacides (that name he bore) Belov'd and honour'd in his native shore; Blest in his riches, in his children more. Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace, Ulysses says he was the son of a Concubine; this was not a matter of disgrace among the Antients, Concubinage being allow'd by the laws. The Sons cast lots for their patrimony, an evidence that this was the practice of the antient Greeks. Hence an inheritance had the name of ??????????, that is from the Lots; Parents put it to the decision of the Lot, to avoid the Envy and Imputation of Partiality in the distribution of their estates. It has been judg'd that the Poet writes according to the Athenian laws, at least this custom prevail'd in the days of Solon; for he forbad parents who had several legitimate Sons to make a will, but ordain'd that all the legitimate Sons should have an equal share of their Father's effects. Eustathius. I shar'd his kindness with his lawful race; But when that Fate which all must undergo From earth remov'd him to the shades below, The large domain his greedy sons divide, And each was portion'd as the lots decide. Little alas! was left my wretched share, Except a house, a covert from the air: But what by niggard Fortune was deny'd A willing widow's copious wealth supply'd. My valour was my plea, a gallant mind That, true to honour, never lagg'd behind, (The sex is ever to a soldier kind.) Now wasting years my former strength confound, And added woes have bow'd me to the ground: Yet by the stubble you may guess the grain, And mark the ruins of no vulgar man. Me Pallas gave to lead the martial storm, And the fair ranks of battle to deform: Me, Mars inspir'd to turn the foe to flight, And tempt the secret ambush of the night. Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear, I saw him not; it was not mine to fear. Before the rest I rais'd my ready steel; The first I met, he yielded, or he fell! But works of peace my soul disdain'd to bear, Plutarch, in his comparison of Aristides and Cato, cites these verses, ? ????? ????? ??????? ?????, ???? ?????????, &amp;c. and tells us, that they who neglect their private and domestic concerns, usually draw their subsistence from violence and rapine. This is certainly a truth, Men are apt to supply their wants, occasion'd by idleness, by plunder and injustice: but it is as certain that no reflection is intended to be cast upon this way of living by Ulysses, for in his age Piracy was not only allowable but glorious, and sudden inroads and incursions were practis'd by the greatest Heroes. Homer therefore only intends to shew that the disposition of Ulysses inclin'd him to pursue the more dangerous, but more glorious, way of living by War, than the more lucrative, but more secure method of life, by Agriculture and husbandry. The rural labour or domestick care. To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing, And send swift arrows from the bounding string, Were arts the Gods made grateful to my mind; Those Gods, who turn (to various ends design'd) The various thoughts and talents of mankind. Before the Grecians touch'd the Trojan plain, Nine times Commander, or by land or main, In foreign fields I spread my glory far, Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war: Thence charg'd with riches, as increas'd in fame, To Crete return'd, an honourable name. But when great Jove that direful war decreed, Which rouz'd all Greece and made the mighty bleed; Our states my self and Idomen employ To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy. Nine years we warr'd; the tenth saw Ilion fall; Homeward we sail'd, but Heav'n dispers'd us all. One only month my wife enjoy'd my stay; So will'd the God who gives and takes away. Nine ships I mann'd equipp'd with ready stores, Intent to voyage to th'Egyptian shores; In feast and sacrifice my chosen train Six days consum'd; the sev'nth we plow'd the main. Crete's ample fields diminish to our eye; Before the Boreal blasts the vessels fly; Safe through the level seas we sweep our way; The steer-man governs, and the ships obey. The fifth fair morn we stem th'Egyptian tide, And tilting o'er the bay the vessels ride: To anchor there my fellows I command, And spies commission to explore the land. But sway'd by lust of gain, and headlong will, The coasts they ravage, and the natives kill. The spreading clamour to their city flies, And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise. The red'ning dawn reveals the circling fields Horrid with bristly spears, and glancing shields. Jove thunder'd on their side. Our guilty head We turn'd to flight; the gath'ring vengeance spread On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lie dead. I then explor'd my thought, what course to prove? (And sure the thought was dictated by Jove, Oh had he left me to that happier doom, And sav'd a life of miseries to come!) The radiant helmet from my brows unlac'd, And low on earth my shield and javelin cast, I meet the Monarch with a suppliant's face, Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace. He heard, he sav'd, he plac'd me at his side; My state he pity'd, and my tears he dry'd, Restrain'd the rage the vengeful foe exprest, And turn'd the deadly weapons from my breast. Pious! to guard the hospitable rite, And fearing Jove, whom mercy's works delight. In Egypt thus with peace and plenty blest, I liv'd (and happy still had liv'd) a guest. On sev'n bright years successive blessings wait; The next chang'd all the colour of my Fate. A false Phœnician of insidious mind, Vers'd in vile arts, and foe to humankind, With semblance fair invites me to his home: I seiz'd the proffer (ever fond to roam) Domestic in his faithless roof I stay'd, 'Till the swift sun his annual circle made. To Lybia then he meditates the way; With guileful art a stranger to betray, And sell to bondage in a foreign land: Much doubting, yet compell'd, I quit the strand. Thro' the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails, Aloof from Crete, before the northern gales: But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost, And far from ken of any other coast, When all was wild expanse of sea and air; Then doom'd high Jove due vengeance to prepare. He hung a night of horrors o'er their head, (The shaded Ocean blacken'd as it spread) He launch'd the fiery bolt; from pole to pole Broad burst the lightnings, deep the thunders roll; In giddy rounds the whirling ship is tost, And all in clouds of smoth'ring sulphur lost. As from a hanging rock's tremendous height, The sable crows with intercepted flight Drop endlong; scarr'd, and black with sulph'rous hue, So from the deck are hurl'd the ghastly crew. Such end the wicked found! But Jove's intent Was yet to save th'opprest and innocent. Plac'd on the mast (the last recourse of life) With winds and waves I held unequal strife; For nine long days the billows tilting o'er, The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotia's shore. The Monarch's son a shipwrackt wretch reliev'd, The Sire with hospitable rites receiv'd, And in his palace like a brother plac'd, With gifts of price and gorgeous garments grac'd. While here I sojourn'd, oft I heard the fame How late Ulysses to the country came, How lov'd, how honour'd in this court he stay'd, And here his whole collected treasure lay'd; I saw my self the vast unnumber'd store Of steel elab'rate, and refulgent ore, And brass high-heap'd amidst the regal dome; Immense supplies for ages yet to come! Mean-time he voyag'd to explore the will These Oaks of Dodona were held to be oraculous, and to be endued with speech, by the Antients; and Pigeons were supposed to be the Priestesses of the Deity. Herodotus in Euterpe gives a full account of what belongs to this Oracle, who tells us, that he was inform'd by the Priestesses of Dodona, that two black Pigeons flew away from Thebes in Egypt, and one of them perching upon a Tree in Dodona, admonish'd the Inhabitants with an human voice to erect an Oracle in that place to Jupiter. But Herodotus solves this Fable after the following manner. “There were two Priestesses carried away from Ægypt, and one of them was sold by the Phœnicians in Greece, where she in her servitude consecrated an Altar to Jupiter under an oak; the Dodonæans gave her the name of a Pigeon, because she was a Barbarian, and her speech at first no more understood than the chattering of a Bird or Pigeon; but as soon as she had learn'd the Greek tongue, it was presently reported that the Pigeon spoke with an human Voice. She had the Epithet Black, because she was an Ægyptian. Eustathius informs us, that Dodona was antiently a City of Thesprotia, and in process of time the limits of it being chang'd, it became of the country of the Molossians, that is, it lay between Thessaly and Epirus: Near this city was a mountain nam'd Tmarus or Timourus; on this mountain there stood a Temple, and within the precincts of it were these oraculous Oaks of Jupiter: This was the most antient Temple of Greece, according to Herodotus, founded by the Pelasgians, and at first serv'd by Priests call'd Selli; and the Goddess Dione being join'd with Jupiter in the worship, the service was perform'd by three aged Priestesses, call'd in the Molossian tongue ???????, as old men were called ??????? (perhaps from the corrupted word ??????? or Antients) and the same word ??????? signifying also Pigeons, gave occasion to the fable of the Temple of Dodona having Doves for Priestesses. But if, as Herodotus affirms, the Phœnicians sold this Priestess of Jupiter originally to the Greeks, it is probable they were called Doves, after the Phœnician language, in which the same word with a small alteration signifies both a Dove and a Priestess. See Note on Odyssey 12. Eustathius gives us another solution of this difficulty, and tells us that as there were ?????????????, or Augurs, who drew predictions from the flight and gestures of Crows; so there were others who predicted from observations made upon Doves: and from hence these Doves were call'd the Prophetesses of Dodona, that being the way by which the decrees of the Gods were discover'd by the Augurs. I have remark'd that the Temple of Dodona stood upon the mountain Timourus, hence the word ???????? came to signify those Oracles, and thus ???????? is used by Lycophron. Now Homer in another place writes, ?? ?? ??? ????????? ???? ???????? ????????. Strabo therefore instead of ???????? reads ????????; for, observes that Author, the Oracles, not the Laws, of Jupiter are preserv'd at Dodona. Eustathius. But whence arose the Fable of these oaks being vocal? I doubt not but this was an illusion of those who gave out the oracles to the people: They conceal'd themselves within the cavities or hollow of the oaks, and from thence deliver'd their Oracles; and imposing by this method upon the superstition and credulity of those ages, persuaded the world that the Gods gave a voice and utterance to the Oaks. I refer the Reader for a larger account of these Dodonæan Oracles to the annotations upon book 16, verse 285. of the Iliad. Of Jove, on high Dodona's holy hill, What means might best his safe return avail, To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail? Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour'd the wine, Attesting solemn all the pow'rs divine, That soon Ulysses would return, declar'd, The sailors waiting, and the ships prepar'd. But first the King dismiss'd me from his shores, For fair Dulichium crown'd with fruitful stores; To good Acastus' friendly care consign'd: But other counsels pleas'd the sailor's mind: New frauds were plotted by the faithless train, And misery demands me once again. Soon as remote from shore they plow the wave, With ready hands they rush to seize their slave; Then with these tatter'd rags they wrapt me round, (Stripp'd of my own) and to the vessel bound. At eve, at Ithaca's delightful land The ship arriv'd: Forth-issuing on the sand, They sought repast; while to th'unhappy kind, The pitying Gods themselves my chains unbind. Soft I descended, to the sea apply'd My nak'd breast, and shot along the tide. Soon past beyond their sight, I left the flood, And took the spreading shelter of the wood. Their prize escap'd the faithless pyrates mourn'd; But deem'd enquiry vain, and to their ship return'd. Screen'd by protecting Gods from hostile eyes, This is a very artful compliment which Ulysses pays to Eumæus, The Gods guided me to the habitation of a person of wisdom, and names not Eumæus, leaving it to him to apply it. I doubt not but the Reader agrees with Ulysses as to the character of Eumæus; there is an air of piety to the Gods in all he speaks, and benevolence to mankind; he is faithful to his King, upright in his trust, and hospitable to the stranger. Dacier is of opinion that ?????? ???????????? takes in Virtue as well as Wisdom; and indeed Homer frequently joins ???????? ??? ???????, and ????????? ???? ???????; that is, Wisdom and Virtue, Folly and Impiety, throughout the Odyssey. For never, never wicked man was wise. Virtue in a great measure depends upon education: it is a Science, and may be learn'd like other Sciences; in reality there is no Knowledge that deserves the name, without Virtue; if Virtue be wanting, Science becomes artifice: as Plato demonstrates from Homer; who, though he is an enemy to this Poet, has enrich'd his writings with his sentiments. They led me to a good man and a wise; To live beneath thy hospitable care, And wait the woes heav'n dooms me yet to bear. It may not perhaps be unsatisfactory to see how Ulysses keeps in sight of truth thro' this whole fabulous story. He gives a true account of his being at the war of Troy; he stays seven years in Ægypt, so long he continu'd with Calypso; the King of Ægypt, whose name Eustathius tells us was Sethon, according to the Antients, entertains him hospitably like that Goddess; a Phœnician detains him a whole year, the same has been observ'd of Circe; the vessel of this Phœnician is lost by a storm, and all the crew perishes except Ulysses; the same is true of the companions of Ulysses: He is thrown upon the land of the Thesprotians by that tempest, and receiv'd courteously by Phidon the King of that country; this represents his being cast upon the Phæacian shore by the storm, and the hospitable Phidon means Alcinous, King of the Phæacians: the manner likewise of his being introduced to Phidon, agrees with his introduction to Alcinous; the daughter introduces him to Alcinous, and the son to Phidon. Thus we see there is a concordia discors thro' the whole narration, the Poet only changing the names of persons and places. Ulysses lay under an absolute necessity thus to falsify his true History, and represent himself as a stranger to the whole Island of Ithaca, otherwise it would have been natural for Eumæus to offer to guide him to his friends, upon which a discovery must inevitably have follow'd, which would have prov'd fatal to that Heroe. Unhappy guest! whose sorrows touch my mind! (Thus good Eumæus with a sigh rejoin'd) For real suff'rings since I grieve sincere, Check not with fallacies the springing tear; Nor turn the passion into groundless joy For him, whom Heav'n has destin'd to destroy. Oh! had he perisht on some well-fought day, Or in his friend's embraces dy'd away! That grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise Historic marbles, to record his praise: His praise, eternal on the faithful stone, Had with transmissive honours grac'd his son. Now snatch'd by Harpies to the dreary coast; This place seems to evince that the expression of being torn by the Harpies, means that the dead person is depriv'd of the rites of Sepulture; and not as Dacier understands it, that he is disappear'd, or that it is unknown what is become of him: for the whole lamentation of Eumæus turns upon this point, namely, that Ulysses is dead, and depriv'd of the funeral Ceremonies. Sunk is the Heroe, and his glory lost! While pensive in his solitary den, Far from gay cities, and the ways of men, I linger life; nor to the court repair, It may appear at first view as if Eumæus thought his absence from the court an aggravation to his calamities, but this is not his meaning: He speaks thus to prevent Ulysses from asking him to introduce him immediately to Penelope; and this is the reason why he enlarges upon the story of the Ætolian, who had deceiv'd him by raising his expectations of the immediate return of Ulysses. It is remarkable that almost all these fictions are made by Cretans, or have some relation to the Island of the Cretans; Thus Ulysses feigns himself to be of Crete, and this Ætolian lays the Scene of his falshood in the same Island: which, as Eustathius observes, may possibly be a latent Satyr upon that people, who were become a reproach and proverb for their remarkable lying. This agrees exactly with the character given them by St. Paul from Epimenides. ?????? ??? ???????. And ????????? signifies to lie. St. Chrysostom fills up the broken verese thus ? ??? ??? ?????, ? ???, ???? ?????? ???????????, ?? ?? ?? ????? ???? ??? ????.. But this is added from Callimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter, thus translated by Mr. Prior, The Cretan boasts thy natal place: but oft He meets reproof deserv'd: for he presumptuous Has built a tomb for thee, who never know'st To die, but liv'st the same to day and ever. That the latter part of these verses belongs to Epimenides, is evident, for St. Paul quotes the verse thus: ?????? ??? ???????, ???? ?????. The two last words are not in Callimachus, and consequently the rest is only a conjectural and erroneous addition. But when the constant Queen commands my care; Or when, to taste her hospitable board, Some guest arrives, with rumours of her Lord; And these indulge their want, and those their woe, And here the tears, and there the goblets flow. By many such have I been warn'd; but chief By one Ætolian robb'd of all belief, Whose hap it was to this our roof to roam, For murder banish'd from his native home. He swore, Ulysses on the coast of Crete Staid but a season to refit his fleet; A few revolving months shou'd waft him o'er, Fraught with bold warriors and a boundless store. O thou! whom Age has taught to understand, And Heav'n has guided with a fav'ring hand! On God or mortal to obtrude a lie Forbear, and dread to flatter, as to die. Not for such ends my house and heart are free, But dear respect to Jove, and charity. And why, oh swain of unbelieving mind! (Thus quick reply'd the wisest of mankind) Doubt you my oath? yet more my faith to try, A solemn compact let us ratify, And witness every pow'r that rules the sky! If here Ulysses from his labours rest, Be then my prize a tunic and a vest; And, where my hopes invite me, strait transport In safety to Dulichium's friendly court. But if he greets not thy desiring eye, Hurl me from yon dread precipice on high; The due reward of fraud and perjury. Doubtless, oh guest! great laud and praise were mine (Reply'd the swain for spotless faith divine) If, after social rites and gifts bestow'd, I stain'd my hospitable hearth with blood. How would the Gods my righteous toils succeed, And bless the hand that made a stranger bleed? No more—th'approaching hours of silent night First claim refection, then to rest invite; Beneath our humble cottage let us haste, And here, unenvy'd, rural dainties taste. Thus commun'd these; while to their lowly dome The full-fed swine return'd with evening home; Compell'd, reluctant, to their sev'ral styes, There is scarce a more sonorous verse in the whole Odyssey. ?????? ?? ??????? ???? ???? ????????????. The word Swine is what debases our Idea: which is evident if we substitute Shepherd in the room of Hogherd, and apply to it the most pompous Epithet given by Homer to Eumæus: For instance, to say ????, or the Illustrious, Hogherd, is mean enough: but the image is more tolerable when we say, the Illustrious Shepherd; the office of a Shepherd (especially as it is familiariz'd and dignify'd in Poetry by the frequent use of it) being in repute. The Greeks have magnificent words to express the most common objects; we want words of equal dignity, and have the disadvantage of being oblig'd to endeavour to raise a Subject that is now in the utmost contempt, so as to guard it from meanness and ignominy. With din obstrep'rous, and ungrateful cries. Then to the slaves—Now from the herd the best Select, in honour of our foreign guest: With him, let us the genial banquet share, For great and many are the griefs we bear; While those who from our labours heap their board, Blaspheme their feeder, and forget their Lord. Thus speaking, with dispatchful hand he took A weighty ax, and cleft the solid oak; This on the earth he pil'd; a boar full fed Of five years age, before the pile was led: The swain, whom acts of piety delight, Observant of the Gods, begins the rite; First shears the forehead of the bristly boar, I have already observ'd that every meal among the Antients was a kind of Sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Gods; and the table as it were an Altar. This Sacrifice being different from any other in Homer, I will fully describe the particulars of it from Eustathius. It is a Rural Sacrifice; we have before seen Sacrifices in Camps, in Courts, and in Cities, in the Iliad; but this is the only one of this nature in all Homer. They cut off the hair of the Victim; in commemoration of the original way of cloathing, which was made of hair, and the skins of beasts. Eumæus strows flour upon it; in remembrance that before Incense was in use, this was the antient manner of offering to the Gods, or as Dacier observes, of consecrating the Victim, instead of the Barley mix'd with Salt, which had the name of Immolation. Eumæus cut a piece from every part of the Victim, by this he made it an Holocaust, or an entire Sacrifice. Eumæus divides the rest at Supper; which was always the office of the most honourable person, and thus we see Achilles and other Heroes employ'd throughout the Iliad. He portions it into seven parts: one he allots to Mercury and the Nymphs, and the rest he reserves for himself, Ulysses, and his four Servants. He gives the Chine to Ulysses, which was ever reputed an honour and distinction; thus Ajax after a victory over Hector is rewarded in the same manner. ??????? ?? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ????????. And suppliant stands, invoking every pow'r To speed Ulysses to his native shore. A knotty stake then aiming at his head, Down drop'd he groaning, and the spirit fled. The scorching flames climb round on ev'ry side: Then the sing'd members they with skill divide; On these, in rolls of fat involv'd with art, The choicest morsels lay from ev'ry part. Some in the flames, bestrow'd with flour, they threw; Some cut in fragments, from the forks they drew: These while on sev'ral tables they dispose, As priest himself, the blameless rustic rose; Expert the destin'd victim to dis-part In sev'n just portions, pure of hand and heart. One sacred to the Nymphs apart they lay; It may be ask'd why Eumæus allots part of the Victim to Mercury and the Nymphs, since there is nothing of the like nature to be found in the whole Iliad and Odyssey? This is done in compliance to the place and person of Eumæus, whose employment lies in the Country, and who has the care of the Herds of Ulysses; he therefore offers to the Nymphs, as they are the Presidents of the Fountains, Rivers, Groves, and furnish sustenance and food for Cattle. And Mercury was held by the Antients to be the Patron of Shepherds: thus Simonides, ????? ??????? ??? ??????? ???? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????????. Eustathius adds (from whom this is taken) that Mercury was a lucrative God, and therefore Eumæus sacrifices to him for increase of his herds: or because he was ?????? ?????, and like Ulysses, Master of all the arts of Cunning and Dissimulation, and then Eumæus may be understood to offer to him for the safety of Ulysses, that he might furnish him with artifice to bring him in security to his Country; and we see this agrees with his prayer. What Dacier adds is yet more to the purpose: Eumæus joyns Mercury with the Nymphs because he was Patron of Flocks, and the Antients generally plac'd the figure of a Ram at the base of his Images; sometimes he is represented carrying a Ram upon his Arms, sometimes upon his Shoulders: In short, it suffices that he was esteem'd a rural Deity, to make the Sacrifice proper to be offer'd to him by a person whose occupation lay in the Country. Another to the winged son of May: The rural tribe in common share the rest, The King the chine, the honour of the feast. Who sate delighted at his servant's board; The faithful servant joy'd his unknown Lord. Oh be thou dear (Ulysses cry'd) to Jove, As well thou claim'st a grateful stranger's love! Be then thy thanks, (the bounteous swain reply'd) Enjoyment of the good the Gods provide. From God's own hand descend our joys and woes; These he decrees, and he but suffers those: All pow'r is his, and whatsoe'er he wills The Will it self, Omnipotent, fulfills. This said, the first-fruits to the Gods he gave; Then pour'd of offer'd wine the sable wave: In great Ulysses' hand he plac'd the bowl, He sate, and sweet refection cheer'd his soul. The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave, (Eumæus' proper treasure bought this slave, And led from Taphos, to attend his board, This custom of purchasing Slaves prevail'd over all, the World, as appears not only from many places of Homer, but of the Holy Scripture, in which mention is made of Slaves bought with Money. The Taphians liv'd in a small Island adjacent to Ithaca; Mentes was King of it, as appears from the first of the Odyssey: They were generally Pirates, and are suppos'd to have had their name from their way of living, which in the Phœnician tongue (as Bochart observes) signifies Rapine; Hataph, and by contraction Taph, bearing that signification. Frequent use has been made of Phœnician interpretations thro' the course of these Notes, and perhaps it may be judg'd necessary to say something why they may be suppos'd to give names to Countries and Persons, more than any other Nation. They are reported to be the inventors of Letters, Lucan lib. 3. Phœnices primi, fame si creditur, ausi Mansuram rudibus vocem signare figuris. and were the greatest Navigators in the World, Dionysius says they were the first, ?? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ???????? ????????? ?????????. The first who used Navigation, the first who traffick'd by the Ocean. If we put these two qualities together, it is no wonder that a great number of places were call'd by Phœnician Names: for they being the first Navigators, must necessarily discover a multitude of Islands, Countries and Cities, to which they would be oblig'd to give names when they describ'd them: And nothing is so probable as that they gave those names according to the observations they made upon the Nature of the several Countries, or employment of the Inhabitants. In the present instance, the Taphians being remarkable Pirates, (as appears from Homer, ? ?????? ????????? ??????, ? ?????????? ??????????? ????????.) the Phœnicians, who first discover'd this Island, call'd it Taph, the Island of Pirates. Places receive appellations according to the language of the Discoverer, and generally from observations made upon the People. It will add a weight to his supposition, if we remember that Homer was well acquainted with the traditions and customs of the Phœnicians, for he speaks frequently of that People through the course of the Odyssey. A servant added to his absent Lord) His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay, And from the banquet take the bowls away. And now the rage of hunger was represt, And each betakes him to his couch to rest. Now came the night, and darkness cover'd o'er Eustathius observes that Homer introduces the following story by a very artful connection, and makes it as it were grow out of the subject: the coldness of the present Season brings to his mind a time like it, when he lay before Troy. It is remarkable that almost all Poets have taken an opportunity to give long descriptions of the night; Virgil, Statius, Apollonius, Tasso, and Dryden, have enlarg'd upon this Subject: Homer seems industriously to have avoided it: perhaps he judg'd such descriptions to be no more than excrescencies, and at best but beautiful superfluities. A modern Hypercritick thinks Mr. Dryden to have excell'd all the Poets in this point. All things are hush'd as Nature's self lay dead, The mountains seem to nod their drowsy head, &amp;c. The last verse is translated from Statius, Et simulant fessos curvata cacumina somnos. which I mention only to propose it to consideration, whether cacumina must in this place of necessity signify the Tops of Mountains; why may it not be apply'd, as it is frequently, to the Tops of the Trees? I question whether the nodding of a Mountain, or the appearance of its nodding, be a natural Image: whereas if we understand it of the Trees, the difficulty vanishes, and the meaning will be much more easy, that the very Trees seem to nod, as in sleep. I beg the Reader's patience to mention another Verse of Statius, that has undoubtedly been mistaken. Qualis ubi audito venantum murmure Tigris, Horruit in maculas. Which Cowley renders, ? he swells with angry pride, And calls forth all his spots on every side. In which sense also the Author of the Spectator quotes it from Cowley. But it is impossible to imagine that the hair of any creature can change into spots; and if any creature could change it by anger, would not the spots remain when the passion was over? The assertion is absolutely against nature, and matter of fact; and as absurd as to affirm that the hair of a Tiger blushes. This mistake arises from the double sense of the word Maculæ, which signifies also the Meshes of a Net, as any common Dictionary will inform us. So Tully, Reticulum minutis maculis; Columella, Rete grandi macula; Ovid, Distinctum maculis rete. This way the sense is obvious: no wonder that a Tiger when enclosed in the toils should horrere in maculas, or erect his hair when he flies against the Meshes, endeavouring to escape; and it agrees with the nature of that animal, to roughen his hair when he is angry. I beg the Reader's pardon for all this, but the mention of a Hypercritick was infecting, and led me into it unawares. The face of things; the winds began to roar; The driving storm the wat'ry west-wind pours, And Jove descends in deluges of show'rs. Studious of rest and warmth, Ulysses lies, Foreseeing from the first the storm wou'd rise; In meer necessity of coat and cloak, With artful preface to his host he spoke. Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace; 'Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place, And wine can of their wits the wise beguile, Make the sage frolic, and the serious smile, The grave in merry measures frisk about, And many a long-repented word bring out, Since to be talkative I now commence, Let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense. Once I was strong (wou'd heav'n restore those days) And with my betters claim'd a share of praise. Ulysses, Menelas led forth a band, And joyn'd me with them, ('twas their own command) A deathful ambush for the foe to lay, Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way: There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread, We made the ozier-fringed bank our bed. Full soon th'inclemency of Heav'n I feel, Nor had these shoulders cov'ring, but of steel. Sharp blew the North; snow whitening all the fields Froze with the blast, and gath'ring glaz'd our shields. There all but I, well fenc'd with cloak and vest, Lay cover'd by their ample shields at rest. Fool that I was! I left behind my own; To understand this passage, we must remember that in those eastern regions, after very hot days an extream cold night would sometimes succeed, even with frost and snow, contrary to the usual order of the season: If it had been winter, no doubt Ulysses would have arm'd himself against the nocturnal cold, and not have been reduc'd to such an extremity. There is one incident in this story that seems extraordinary, Ulysses and Menelaus are said to form an ambush under the very walls of Troy, and yet are describ'd to be sleeping while they thus form it: The words are ????? ??????? ????? does not necessarily signify to be asleep, as is already prov'd from the conclusion of the first Iliad: But here it must have that import, for Ulysses tells his companions that he has had an extraordinary dream. Besides, even a tendency towards sleep should be avoided by soldiers in an ambuscade, especially by the leaders of it: The only answer that occurs to me, is that perhaps they had Centinels waking while they slept; but even this would be unsoldier-like in our ages. The skill of weather and of winds unknown, And trusted to my coat and shield alone! When now was wasted more than half the night, And the stars faded at approaching light; Sudden I jogg'd Ulysses, who was laid Fast by my side, and shiv'ring thus I said. Here longer in this field I cannot lie, The winter pinches, and with cold I die, And die asham'd (oh wisest of mankind) The only fool who left his cloak behind. He thought, and answer'd: hardly waking yet, Sprung in his mind the momentary wit; (That wit, which or in council, or in fight, Still met th'emergence, and determin'd right) Hush thee, he cry'd, (soft-whisp'ring in my ear) Speak not a word, lest any Greek may hear— And then (supporting on his arm his head) Hear me, companions! (thus aloud he said) Methinks too distant from the fleet we lye: Ev'n now a Vision stood before my eye, And sure the warning Vision was from high: Let from among us some swift Courier rise, Haste to the Gen'ral, and demand supplies. Upstarted Thoas strait, Andræmon's son, Nimbly he rose, and cast his garment down; Instant, the racer vanish'd off the ground; That instant, in his cloak I wrapt me round: And safe I slept, till brightly-dawning shone The Morn, conspicuous on her golden throne. Oh were my strength as then, as then my age! Some friend would fence me from the winter's rage. Yet tatter'd as I look, I challeng'd then The honors, and the offices of men: Some master, or some servant would allow A cloak and vest—but I am nothing now! Well hast thou spoke (rejoin'd th'attentive swain) Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain! Nor garment shalt thou want, nor ought beside, Meet, for the wand'ring suppliant to provide. But in the morning take thy cloaths again, This is not spoken in vain, it was necessary for Ulysses to appear in the form of a beggar to prevent discovery. The word in the Greek is ???????????, which it is impossible to translate without a circumlocution: It paints (observes Eustathius) exactly the dress of a beggar, and the difficulty he labours under in drawing his rags to cover one part of his body that is naked, and while he covers that, leaving the other part bare: ??????????? is ???? ???????? ???????? or ????????, and expresses how a beggar is embarrassed in the act of covering his body, by reason of the rents in his cloaths. For here one vest suffices ev'ry swain; It is not at first view evident why Ulysses requests a change of raiment from Eumæus, for a better dress would only have exposed him to the danger of a discovery. Besides, this would have been a direct opposition to the injunctions of the Goddess of Wisdom, who had not only disguis'd him in the habit of a beggar, but chang'd his features to a conformity with it. Why then should he make this petition? The answer is, to carry on his disguise the better before Eumæus; he has already told him that he was once a person of dignity, tho' now reduc'd to poverty by calamities: and consequently a person who had once known better fortunes would be uneasy under such mean circumstances, and desire to appear like himself; therefore he asks a better dress, that Eumæus may believe his former story. What Eumæus speaks of not having many changes of garments, is not a sign of poverty, but of the simplicity of the manners of those ages. It is the character of the luxurious, vain Phæacians, to delight in changes of dress, and agrees not with this plain, sincere, industrious Ithacan, Eumæus. I wonder this last part of the relation of Ulysses has escap'd the censure of the Critics: The circumstance of getting the Cloak of Thoas in the cold Night, tho' it shows the artifice of Ulysses essential to his Character, yet perhaps may be thought unworthy the Majesty of Epic Poetry, where every thing ought to be great and magnificent. It is of such a nature as to raise a smile, rather than admiration, and Virgil has utterly rejected such levities. Perhaps it may be thought that Ulysses adapts himself to Eumæus, and endeavours to engage his favour by that piece of pleasantry; yet this does not solve the objection, for Eumæus is not a person of a low Character: no one in the Odyssey speaks with better Sense, or better Morality. One would almost imgine that Homer was sensible of the weakness of this Story, he introduces it so artfully: He tells us in a short Preface, that Wine unbends the most serious and wise Person, and makes him laugh, dance, and speak without his usual caution: And then he proceeds to the fable of his ambush before Troy. But no introduction can reconcile it to those who think such Comic relations should not at all be introduc'd into Epic Poetry. No change of garments to our hinds is known: But when return'd, the good Ulysses' son With better hand shall grace with fit attires His guest, and send thee where thy soul desires. The honest herdsman rose, as this he said, And drew before the hearth the stranger's bed: The fleecy spoils of sheep, a goat's rough hide He spreads; and adds a mantle thick and wide; With store to heap above him, and below, And guard each quarter as the tempests blow. There lay the King, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care: A French Critic has been very severe upon this conduct of Eumæus, The Divine Hogherd, says he, having given the Divine Ulysses his Supper, sends him to sleep with his Hogs, that had white Teeth. When Critics find fault, they ought to take care that they impute nothing to an Author but what the Author really speaks, otherwise it is not Criticism, but Calumny and Ignorance. Monsieur Perault is here guilty of both, for Ulysses sleeps in the house of Eumæus, and Eumæus retires to take care of his charge, not to sleep but to watch with them. This and the preceding Book take up no more than the space of one day. Ulysses lands in the morning, which is spent in consultation with Minerva how to bring about his restoration: About noon he comes to Eumæus, for immediately after his arrival they dine: They pass the afternoon and evening in conference: So that thirty five days are exactly compleated since the beginning of the Odyssey. Well arm'd, and fenc'd against nocturnal air; His weighty faulchion o'er his shoulder ty'd: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supply'd: With his broad spear, the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where screen'd from Boreas, high-o'erarch'd, they lay. The End of the Third Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. THE FIFTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Return of Telemachus. The Goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a Vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part; and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the Soothsayer, The Scene then changes to the Cottage of Eumæus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the mean time Telemachus arrives on the Coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumæus. Neither this book, nor indeed some of the following, are to be reckon'd among the most shining parts of the Odyssey. They are narrative, and generally low; yet natural, and just enough, considering Homer was resolv'd to describe and follow low life so very minutely. This great Poet here resembles an evening Sun; he has not the same heat or brightness; there are several little clouds about him, tho' in some places gilded and adorn'd: however, to make us amends, he breaks out again before the conclusion of his course, and sets at last in glory. There is no doubt, but all the parts of a Poem are not capable of equal lustre; nay, they ought not to dazzle us alike, or tire us by a perpetual strain upon the imagination. But in these cooler relations a Translator has a hard task: He is expected to shine, where the Author is not bright: and the unreasonable Critic demands a Copy more noble than the Original. 'Tis true, these are the passages of which he ought to take particular care, and to set them off to the best advantage: But however he may polish a vulgar stone, it will still retain its inherent degree of cloudiness; and the man is ignorant indeed, who thinks one can make it a Diamond. The story now turns to Telemachus, and the Poet briefly describes his voyage to his country: There is a necessity to be concise, for the Heroe of an Epic Poem is never to be out of sight, after his introduction. The little time that Homer employs in the return of Telemachus is not spent unusefully by Ulysses; during this interval, he learns the state of his publick and domestick affairs from Eumæus, and prepares the way for the destruction of the Suitors, the chief design of the whole Odyssey. There is another reason why the Poet ought not to dwell at large upon the story of Telemachus; he bears but an incidental relation to the Odyssey, and consequently Homer was necessitated to pass over his actions with brevity, that he might describe the Heroe of his Poem at full length. It has been objected, that no mention has been made of any action at all of Telemachus during his whole stay with Menelaus, and that he lies there idly, without making his voyage contribute any thing to the restitution of Ulysses; but from the former observation it is evident, that this silence in the Poet proceeds from judgment; nothing is to be inserted in an Epic Poem but what has some affinity with the main design of it: but what affinity could the actions of Telemachus in the Spartan court have with those of Ulysses? This would have been to make two Heroes in one Poem, and would have broken the unity of the action; whereas by the contrary conduct Homer unites the two stories, and makes the voyage of Telemachus subservient to the chief action; namely, the restitution of Ulysses. Telemachus undertakes a voyage to make enquiry after Ulysses; this the Poet fully describes, because it has an immediate relation to Ulysses; but passes over all other adventures during the absence of Telemachus, because they have no relation to the design. I know it has been objected, that the whole story of Telemachus is foreign to the Odyssey, and that the four first books have not a sufficient connection with the rest of the Poem, and therefore that there is a double action: But this objection will cease, if it be made appear, that this voyage contributes to the restoration of Ulysses; for whatever incident has such an effect is united to the subject, and essential to it. Now that this voyage has such an effect is very evident; the suitors were ready to seize the throne of Ulysses, and compel his wife to marry; but by this voyage Telemachus breaks their whole designs. Instead of usurping the throne, they are obliged to defend themselves: they defer their purpose, and waste much time in endeavouring to intercept him in his return. By this method leisure is gain'd from the violence and addresses of the suitors, till Ulysses returns and brings about his own re-establishment. This voyage therefore is the secret source from which all the happiness of Ulysses flows: for had not Telemachus sailed to Pyle, Penelope must have been compell'd to marry, and the throne of Ulysses usurped. I have been more large upon this objection, because many foreign Critics lay great weight upon it. See Note XIX on the first book. There has lately been a great dispute amongst the French, concerning the length of the stay of Telemachus from his country. The debate is not very material, nor is it very difficult to settle that point. Telemachus sail'd from Ithaca in the evening of the second day, and returns to it on the thirty eighth in the morning, so that he is absent thirty five days compleatly. Now had Minerva reach'd those ample plains, If this had been related by an Historian, he would have only said that Telemachus judged it necessary for his affairs to sail back to his own country; but a Poet steps out of the common beaten road, ascribes the wisdom of that Heroe to the Goddess of it, and introduces her in person, to give a dignity to his Poetry. The Reader may consult in general the extracts from Bossu, (plac'd before the Odyssey) concerning machines, or the interposition of Deities in Epic Poetry. I will here beg leave to set them in a different and more particular light. It has been imagin'd that a Deity is never to be introduc'd but when all human means are ineffectual: If this were true, Minerva would be in vain employ'd in bringing Telemachus back, when a common Messenger might have answer'd that purpose as well as the Goddess. I doubt not but the verse of Horace has led many into this error; Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus. This rule is to be apply'd only to the Theater, of which Horace there speaks, and means no more, than when the knot of the Play is to be unty'd, and no other way is left for making the discovery, then let a God descend and clear the intricacy to the Auditors. But, as Mr. Dryden observes, it has no relation to Epic Poetry. It is true, that a Deity is never to be introduc'd upon little and unworthy occasions; the very design of Machines is to add weight and dignity to the story, and consequently an unworthy employment defeats the very intent of them, and debases the Deities by making them act in offices unworthy of the characters of divine personages: But then it is as true, that a Poet is at liberty to use them for ornament as well as necessity. For instance, both Virgil and Homer in their descriptions of storms introduce Deities, Neptune and Æolus, only to fill our minds with grandeur and terror; for in reality a storm might have happen'd without a miracle, and Æneas and Ulysses both have been driven upon unknown shores, by a common storm as well as by immediate interposition of Neptune or Æolus. But machines have a very happy effect; the Poet seems to converse with Gods, gives signs of a divine transport, and distinguishes his Poem in all parts from an History. Fam'd for the dance, where Menelaus reigns; Anxious she flies to great Ulysses' heir, His instant voyage challeng'd all her care. Beneath the royal Portico display'd, Minerva here finds Telemachus in bed: It is necessary to remember that Ulysses landed in Ithaca in the morning of the thirty fifth day; and when Minerva left him, she went to the Spartan court to Telemachus; this vision therefore appears to that Heroe in the night following the thirty fifth day. On the thirty sixth he departs from Menelaus, and lodges that night with Diocles; on the thirty seventh he embarks towards the evening, sails all night, and lands on the thirty eighth in the morning in his own country. From this observation it is likewise evident, that Ulysses passes two days in discourse with Eumæus, tho' the Poet only distinguishes the time by the voyage of Telemachus; for the preceding book concludes with the thirty fifth day, and Telemachus spends the thirty sixth and thirty seventh and the following night in his return, and meets Ulysses in the morning of the thirty eighth day. This remark is necessary to avoid confusion, and to make the two stories of Ulysses and Telemachus coincide, in this and the next book of the Odyssey. With Nestor's Son, Telemachus was lay'd; In sleep profound the Son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unfeal'd his eyes: Restless he griev'd, with various fears opprest, And all thy fortunes roll'd within his breast. When, O Telemachus! (the Goddess said) Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray'd. Thus leaving careless thy paternal right The robbers prize, the prey to lawless might. On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam, Ev'n now, the hand of Rapine sacks the dome. Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore: Fly, whilst thy Mother virtuous yet withstands Her kindred's wishes, and her Sire's commands; Ovid had these lines in his view in his Epistle of Penelope to Ulysses. Me pater Icarius viduo decedere lecto Cogit, &amp; immensas increpat usque moras. But why should Minerva make use of these arguments, to persuade Telemachus to return immediately; and give him no information concerning the safety of Ulysses, who was now actually landed in his own country? The Poet reserves this discovery to be made in the future part of the story: If Telemachus had known of his father's being already return'd, there could have been no room for the beautiful interview between the father and the son; for the doubts and fears, the surprize and filial tenderness, on the part of Telemachus; and for the paternal fondness, the yearnings of nature, and the transports of joy, on the part of Ulysses. Aristotle particularly commends this conduct of Homer with respect to Ulysses. These disguises and concealments, (says that Author) perplex the fable with agreeable plots and intricacies, surprize us with a variety of incidents, and give room for the relation of many adventures; while Ulysses still appears in assum'd characters, and upon every occasion recites a new History. At the same time the Poet excellently sustains his character, which is every where distinguish'd by a wise and ready dissimulation. Thro' both, Eurymachus pursues the dame, And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim. Hence therefore, while thy stores thy own remain; Thou know'st the practice of their female train. This is not spoken in derogation of Penelope, nor apply'd to her in particular; it is laid down as an universal maxim, and utter'd by the Goddess of wisdom: But (says Madam Dacier) I wish the Poet had told us, if the husbands in his days had better memories toward their departed wives? But what advantage would this be to the fair sex, if we allow that an husband may possibly forget a former wife? I chuse rather to congratulate the modern Ladies, against whom there is not the least objection of this nature. Is it not evident, that all our widows are utterly disconsolate, appear many months in deep mourning? and whenever they are prevail'd upon to a second marriage, do they not chuse out the strongest, best built, and most vigorous youth of the nation? For what other reason, but that such constitutions may be a security against their ever feeling the like calamity again? What I have here said shews that the world is well chang'd since the times of Homer; and however the race of man is dwindled and decayed since those ages, yet it is a demonstration that the modern Ladies are not to blame for it. Lost in the children of the present spouse They slight the pledges of the former vows; Their love is always with the lover past; Still the succeeding flame expells the last. Let o'er thy house some chosen maid preside, Till heav'n decrees to bless thee in a bride. But now thy more attentive ears incline, Observe the warnings of a pow'r divine: For thee their snares the Suitor Lords shall lay In Samos sands, or streights of Ithaca, To seize thy life shall lurk the murd'rous band, Ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land. No—sooner far their riot and their lust All-cov'ring earth shall bury deep in dust! Then distant from the scatter'd Islands steer, Nor let the night retard thy full career; Thy heav'nly guardian shall instruct the gales To smooth thy passage, and supply thy sails: And when at Ithaca thy labour ends, Send to the town thy vessel with thy friends, But seek thou first the Master of the swine, (For still to thee his loyal thoughts incline) There pass the night; while he his course pursues To bring Penelope the wish'd-for news, That thou safe sailing from the Pylian strand Art come to bless her in thy native land. Thus spoke the Goddess, and resum'd her flight To the pure regions of eternal light. Mean-while Pisistratus he gently shakes, And with these words the slumb'ring youth awakes. Rise, son of Nestor! for the road prepare, And join the harness'd coursers to the car. What cause, he cry'd, can justifie our flight, To tempt the dangers of forbidding night? Here wait we rather, till approaching day Shall prompt our speed, and point the ready way. Nor think of flight before the Spartan King Shall bid farewel, and bounteous presents bring; Gifts, which to distant ages safely stor'd, The sacred act of friendship shall record. Thus he. But when the dawn bestreak'd the East, The King from Helen rose, and sought his guest. As soon as his approach the Heroe knew, The splendid mantle round him first he threw, Then o'er his ample shoulders whirl'd the cloak, Respectful met the Monarch, and bespoke. Hail, great Atrides, favour'd of high Jove! Let not thy Friends in vain for licence move. Swift let us measure back the wat'ry way, Nor check our speed, impatient of delay. If with desire so strong thy bosom glows, Ill, said the King, shou'd I thy wish oppose; For oft in others freely I reprove The ill-tim'd efforts of officious love; Who love too much, hate in the like extream, And both the golden Mean alike condemn. Alike he thwarts the hospitable end, Who drives the free, or stays the hasty friend; True friendship's laws are by this rule exprest, Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest. Homer has here laid together admirable precepts for social life; the passage was much admir'd; Herodotus borrow'd it, as we are inform'd by Eustathius. ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???? ?????? ???????. But perhaps Eustathius quoted by memory, or thro' inadvertency wrote down Herodotus for Theocritus, in whom these lines are to be found: ???? ?????????? ????? ???????, ???? ??????? ?????????? ?????????, ???? ???????? ???????. Yet stay, my friends, and in your chariot take The noblest presents that our love can make: Mean-time commit we to our women's care Some choice domestic viands to prepare; The trav'ler rising from the banquet gay, Eludes the labours of the tedious way. Then if a wider course shall rather please Thro' spacious Argos, and the Realms of Greece, Atrides in his chariot shall attend; Himself thy convoy to each royal friend. No Prince will let Ulysses' heir remove Without some pledge, some monument of love: These will the Chaldron, these the Tripod give, From those the well-pair'd mules we shall receive, Or bowl emboss'd whose golden figures live. To whom the Youth, for prudence fam'd, reply'd. O Monarch, care of heav'n! thy peoples pride! No friend in Ithaca my place supplies, No pow'rful hands are there, no watchful eyes: My stores expos'd and fenceless house demand The speediest succour from my guardian hand; Lest in a search too anxious and too vain Of one lost joy, I lose what yet remain. His purpose when the gen'rous warrior heard, He charg'd the houshold cates to be prepar'd. It is in the original, He commanded Helen and her maids to do it. The moderns have blam'd Menelaus for want of delicacy, in commanding his Queen to perform such houshold offices. I read such passages with pleasure, because they are exact pictures of antient life: We may as well condemn the first inhabitants of the world for want of politeness, in living in tents and bowers, and not in palaces. This command of Menelaus agrees with those manners, and with the patriarchal life. Gen. xviii. 6. Abraham hasten'd into his tent, and said unto Sarah his wife, make ready quickly three measures of fine meal: Knead it, and makes cakes upon the hearth. I doubt not but the continual descriptions of entertaiments have likewise given offence to many; but we may be in some degree reconcil'd to them, if we consider they are not only instances of the hospitality of the antients, but of their piety and religion: Every meal was a religious act, a sacrifice, or a feast of thanksgiving: libations of wine, and offerings of part of the flesh were constantly made at every entertainment. This gives a dignity to the description, and when we read it, we are not to consider it as an act merely of eating or drinking, but as an office of worship to the Gods. This is a note of the Critics; but perhaps the same thing might as well be said of our modern entertainments, wherever the good practice of saying Grace before and after meat is not yet laid aside. Now with the dawn, from his adjoining home, Was Boethœdes Eteoneus come; Swift as the word he forms the rising blaze, And o'er the coals the smoaking fragments lays. Mean-time the King, his Son, and Helen, went Where the rich wardrobe breath'd a costly scent. The King selected from the glitt'ring rows A bowl; the Prince a silver beaker chose. The beauteous Queen revolv'd with careful eyes Her various textures of unnumber'd dies, And chose the largest; with no vulgar art Her own fair hands embroider'd ev'ry part: Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright, Like radiant Hesper o'er the gems of night. If this passage were translated literally, it would stand thus, Helen chose a vesture of most beautiful embroidery, and of the largest extent, a vesture that lay beneath the rest. We are to understand by the last circumstance, that this vesture was the choicest of her wardrobe, it being reposited with the greatest care, or ??????? ?????. The verses are taken from lib. 6. of the Iliad. This robe was the work of Helen's own hands; an instance that in those days a great Lady, or a great Beauty, might be a good work-woman: And she here seems to take particular care to obviate an opinion one might otherwise have, that she did not apply herself to these works till her best days were past. We are told in the Iliad, Her in the Palace: at her loom she found, The golden web her own sad story crown'd: The Troian wars she weav'd, her self the prize, And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes. Then with each gift they hasten'd to their guest, And thus the King Ulysses' heir addrest. Since fix'd are thy resolves, may thund'ring Jove With happiest omens thy desires approve! This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine Enchas'd with gold, this valu'd gift be thine; To me this present, of Vulcanian frame, From Sidon's hospitable Monarch came; To thee we now consign the precious load, The pride of Kings, and labour of a God. Then gave the cup; while Megapenthe brought The silver vafe with living sculpture wrought. The beauteous Queen, advancing next, display'd The shining veil, and thus endearing said. Accept, dear youth, this monument of love, Long since, in better days, by Helen wove: Safe in thy mother's care the vesture lay, To deck thy bride, and grace thy nuptial day. Mean-time may'st thou with happiest speed regain Thy stately palace, and thy wide domain. She said, and gave the veil; with grateful look The Prince the variegated present took. And now, when thro' the royal dome they pass'd, High on a throne the King each stranger plac'd. A golden ew'r th' attendant damsel brings, Replete with water from the crystal springs; With copious streams the shining vase supplies A silver laver of capacious size. They wash. The tables in fair order spread, The glitt'ring canisters are crown'd with bread; Viands of various kinds allure the taste Of choicest sort and savour; rich repast! Whilst Eteoneus portions out the shares, Atrides' son the purple draught prepares. And now (each sated with the genial feast, And the short rage of thirst and hunger ceast) Ulysses' son, with his illustrious friend, The horses join, the polish'd car ascend. Along the court the fiery steeds rebound, And the wide portal echoes to the sound. The king precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine (Libation destin'd to the Pow'rs divine) His right-hand held: before the steeds he stands, Then, mix'd with pray'rs, he utters these commands. Farewel and prosper, youths! let Nestor know What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow, For all the proofs of his paternal care, Thro' the long dangers of the ten-years war. Ah! doubt not our report (the Prince rejoin'd) Of all the virtues of thy generous mind. And oh! return'd might we Ulysses meet! It is not impossible but a false reading may have crept into the text in this verse. In the present edition it stands thus. ? ?? ??? ???? ?? ????????, ?????? ?? ????, ?????? ??? ???? ???????. ? The sense will be less intricate, and the construction more easy, if instead of ????, we insert ?????, and read the line thus pointed. ???????? ?????? ??, ????? ?????? ??? ???? ???????. ? Then the verse will have this import, “O may I, upon my return to Ithaca, finding Ulysses in his Palace, give him an account of your friendship!” Whereas in the common editions there is a tautology, and either ???? or ???????? must be allowed to be a superfluity. To him thy presents shew, thy words repeat: How will each speech his grateful wonder raise? How will each gift indulge us in thy praise? Scarce ended thus the Prince, when on the right Advanc'd the bird of Jove: auspicious sight! A milkwhite fowl his clinching talons bore, With care domestic pamper'd at the floor. Peasants in vain with threatning cries pursue, In solemn speed the bird majestic flew Full dexter to the car: the prosp'rous sight Fill'd ev'ry breast with wonder and delight. But Nestor's son the chearful silence broke, And in these words the Spartan chief bespoke. Say if to us the Gods these Omens send, Or fates peculiar to thy self portend? Whilst yet the Monarch paus'd, with doubts opprest, The beauteous Queen reliev'd his lab'ring breast. Hear me, she cry'd, to whom the Gods have giv'n It is not clear why the Poet ascribes a greater quickness and penetration to Helen in the solution of this prodigy, than to Menelaus. Is it, as Eustathius asserts, from a superior acuteness of nature and presence of mind in the fair sex? Or is it, that Helen in this resembles some modern beauties, who (tho' their husbands be ask'd the question) will make the answer themselves? I would willingly believe that Helen might happen to stand in such a position, as to be able to make more minute observations upon the flight of the eagle, than Menelaus; and being more circumstantial in the observation, she might for that reason be more ready and circumstantial in the interpretation. But Homer himself tells us, that she receiv'd it from the Gods. This is a pious lesson, to teach us in general that all knowledge is the gift of God, and perhaps here particularly inserted to raise the character of Helen, and make us less surpriz'd to see her forgiven by Menelaus, when she is not only pardon'd, but favour'd thus with inspiration. And indeed it was necessary to reconcile us to this fatal Beauty; at whom the Reader is naturally enough offended: She is an actress in many of the scenes of the Odyssey, and consequently to be redeem'd from contempt: This is done by degrees; the Poet steals away the adultress from our view, to set before us the amiable penitent. To read this sign, and mystick sense of heav'n. As thus the plumy sov'reign of the air Ulysses is the eagle, the bird represents the suitors: the cries of the men and women when the eagle seiz'd his prey, denote the lamentations of the relations of the suitors, who are slain by Ulysses. The circumstance of the flight of the eagle close to the horses, is added to shew that the prodigy had a fix'd and certain reference to a person present; namely Telemachus: The eagle comes suddenly from a mountain; this means that Ulysses shall unexpectedly arrive from the country to the suitors destruction. The fowl is said to be fed by the family, this is a full designation of the suitors, who feed upon Ulysses, and prey upon his family. And as this bird is kill'd by the talons of the eagle, so the suitors fall by the spear of Ulysses. Eustathius. Left on the mountain's brow his callow care, And wander'd thro' the wide ethereal way To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey; So shall thy god-like father, toss'd in vain Thro' all the dangers of the boundless main, Arrive, (or is perchance already come) From slaughter'd gluttons to release the dome. Oh! if this promis'd bliss by thund'ring Jove, (The Prince reply'd) stand fix'd in fate above; To thee, as to some God, I'll temples raise, And crown thy altars with the costly blaze. He said; and bending o'er his chariot, flung Athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong; The bounding shafts upon the harness play, 'Till night descending intercepts the way. To Diocles, at Phæræ, they repair, Whose boasted Sire was sacred Alpheus' heir; With him all night the youthful strangers stay'd, Nor found the hospitable rites unpay'd. But soon as morning from her orient bed Had ting'd the mountains with her earliest red, They join'd the steeds and on the chariot sprung; The brazen portals in their passage rung. To Pylos soon they came; when thus begun To Nestor's heir Ulysses' god-like son: Let not Pisistratus in vain be prest, Nor unconsenting hear his friend's request; His friend by long hereditary claim, In toils his equal, and in years the same. No farther from our vessel, I implore, The coursers drive; but lash them to the shore. Too long thy father would his friend detain; This has been objected against, as contrary to the promise of Telemachus, who assur'd Menelaus that he would acquaint Nestor with his great friendship and hospitality; Is he therefore not guilty of falshood, by embarking immediately without fulfilling his promise? Eustathius answers, that the prodigy of the eagle occasions this alteration, and that the not fulfilling his promise is to be ascrib'd to accident and necessity. But the words of Telemachus sufficiently justify his veracity; they are of the plural number ???????????, I and Pisistratus will inform Nestor of your hospitality: This promise he leaves to be perform'd by Pisistratus, who returns directly to Nestor. Others blame Telemachus as unpolite, in leaving Nestor without any acknowledgment for his civilities. Dacier has recourse to the command of Minerva, and to the prodigy of the eagle, for his vindication: He is commanded by the Gods to return immediately, and therefore not blameable for complying with their injunctions. But perhaps it is a better reason to say, that the nature of the Poem requires such a conduct; the action of the Odyssey stands still till the return of Telemachus (whatever happens to him in Pyle being foreign to it) and therefore Homer shews his judgment, in precipitating the actions of Telemachus, rather than trifling away the time, while the story sleeps, only to shew a piece of complaisance and ceremony. I dread his proffer'd kindness, urg'd in vain. The Heroe paus'd, and ponder'd this request, While love and duty warr'd within his breast. At length resolv'd, he turn'd his ready hand, And lash'd his panting coursers to the strand. There, while within the poop with care he stor'd The regal presents of the Spartan Lord; With speed be gone, (said he) call ev'ry mate, Ere yet to Nestor I the tale relate: 'Tis true, the fervor of his gen'rous heart Brooks no repulse, nor could'st thou soon depart: Himself will seek thee here, nor wilt thou find, In words alone, the Pylian Monarch kind. But when arriv'd he thy return shall know, How will his breast with honest fury glow? This said, the sounding strokes his horses fire, And soon he reach'd the Palace of his Sire. Now, (cry'd Telemachus) with speedy care Hoise ev'ry sail, and ev'ry oar prepare. Swift as the word his willing mates obey, And seize their seats, impatient for the sea. Mean-time the Prince with sacrifice adores Minerva, and her guardian aid implores; When lo! a wretch ran breathless to the shore, New from his crime, and reeking yet with gore. A Seer he was, from great Melampus sprung, There is some obscurity in this genealogical History. Melampus was a prophet, he liv'd in Pylos, and was a person of great wealth; his uncle Neleus seiz'd his riches, and detain'd them a whole year, to oblige him to recover his herds detain'd by Iphyclus in Phylace; he fail'd in the attempt, and was kept in prison by Iphyclus, the son of Phylacus. Bias, the brother of Melampus, was in love with Pero the daughter of Neleus; Neleus, to engage Melampus more strongly in the enterprize, promises to give Pero in marriage to his brother Bias, upon the recovery of his herds from Iphyclus. At length Iphyclus releases Melampus from prison, upon his discovering to him how he might have an heir to succeed to his dominions, and rewards him with restoring the herds of Neleus: Then Neleus retracts his promise, and refuses to give his daughter Pero to Bias the brother of Melampus; upon this Neleus and Melampus quarrel, and engaging in a single combat, Neleus is vanquish'd, and Melampus retires to Argos. See lib. XI. v. 350, &amp;c. and the annotations, Note 23. Melampus, who in Pylos flourish'd long, 'Till urg'd by wrongs a foreign realm he chose, Far from the hateful cause of all his woes. Neleus his treasures one long year detains; As long, he groan'd in Phylacus his chains: Mean-time, what anguish and what rage combin'd, For lovely Pero rack'd his lab'ring mind! Yet 'scap'd he death; and vengeful of his wrong To Pylos drove the lowing herds along: Then (Neleus vanquish'd, and consign'd the Fair To Bias' arms) he sought a foreign air; Argos the rich for his retreat he chose, There form'd his empire; there his palace rose. From him Antiphates and Mantius came: The first begot Oicleus great in fame, And he Amphiaraus, immortal name! The people's Saviour, and divinely wise, Belov'd by Jove, and him who gilds the skies, The Poet means Eryphyle, who, being brib'd with a golden bracelet by Polynices, persuaded her husband Amphiaraus to go to the Theban war, where he lost his life. This is a remarkable passage: Tho' he was lov'd by Jupiter and Apollo, yet he reach'd not to old age. Is a short life the greatest instance of the love of the Gods? Plato quotes the verse to this purpose. “The life of man is so loaded with calamity, that it is an instance of the favour of Heaven to take the burthen from us with speed.” The same Author in Axiochus (if that dialogue be his) asserts, that the Gods, having a perfect insight into human affairs, take speedily to themselves those whom they love. Thus when Trophonius and Agamedes had built a temple to Apollo, they pray'd to receive a blessing the most beneficial to mankind: the God granted their prayers, and they were both found dead the next morning. Thus likewise the Priestess of Juno, when her two sons had yok'd themselves to her chariot, and drawn her for the greater expedition to the temple, pray'd to the Goddess to reward their filial piety; and they both dy'd that night. This agrees with the expression of Menander, He whom the Gods love dies young. ?? ?? ???? ????????, ?????????? ???? Yet short his date of life! by female pride he dies. From Mantius Clitus, whom Aurora's love There is nothing more common than such accounts of men being carried away by Goddesses, in all the Greek Poets; and yet what offends more against credibility? The Poets invented these fables merely out of compliment to the dead. When any person happen'd to be drown'd in a river; if a man, some Water Nymph stole him; if a woman, she was seiz'd to be the wife of the River God. If any were lost at sea, Neptune or some of the Sea Gods or Goddesses had taken them to their beds. But to speak to the present purpose; if any person dy'd in the fields, and his body happen'd not to be found, if he was murther'd and buried, or devour'd by wild beasts, so that no account was heard of his death, he was immediately imagin'd to be taken from the earth by some Deity who was in love with his beauty. Thus Clitus being lost in his morning sports, like Orion while he was hunting, he was fabled to be carry'd to Heav'n by Aurora; being lost at the time of the morning, over which that Deity presides. Snatch'd for his beauty to the thrones above: And Polyphides on whom Phœbus shone With fullest rays, Amphiaraus now gone; In Hyperesia's groves he made abode, And taught mankind the counsels of the God. From him sprung Theoclymenus, who found We have had a long genealogical digression to introduce Theoclymenus: I fear the whole passage will prove distasteful to an English palate, it not being capable of any ornaments of Poetry. I could wish Homer had omitted or shorten'd such Passages, tho' they might be useful in his age; for by such honourable insertions he made his court to the best families then in Greece. 'Tis true, the story is told concisely, and this occasions some obscurity; distance of time as well as place, makes us see all objects somewhat confusedly and indistinctly. In the days of Homer these stories were universally known, and consequently wanted no explication; the obscurity therefore is not to be charged upon Homer, but to Time, which has defac'd and worn away some parts of the impression, and made the images less discernible. The use the Poet makes of the adventure of Theoclymenus, is to give encouragement to Telemachus; he assists him with his advice, and by his gift of prophecy explains to him a prodigy in the conclusion of this Book. By this method he connects it with the main action, in giving Telemachus assurances that his affairs hasten to a re-establishment. Besides these short relations are valuable, as they convey to posterity brief histories of antient facts and families that are extant no where else. (The sacred wine yet foaming on the ground) Telemachus: whom, as to heav'n he prest His ardent vows, the stranger thus addrest. O thou! that dost thy happy course prepare With pure libations, and with solemn pray'r; By that dread pow'r to whom thy vows are paid; By all the lives of these; thy own dear head, Declare sincerely to no foe's demand Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land. These questions may be thought somewhat extraordinary; for what apparent reason is there for this fugitive to be told the name of the parents of Telemachus? But the interrogations are very material; he makes them to learn if Telemachus or his father are friends to the person slain by his hand? if they were, instead of sailing with him, he would have reason to fly from him, as from a person who might take away his life by the laws of the country. Thus in the Hebrew law, Numb. xxxv. 9. The revenger of blood, (? ??????????, or propinquus) shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him. But the Jews had cities of refuge, to which the murtherers fled as to a sanctuary: The Greeks in like manner, if the homicide fled into a voluntary exile, permitted him to be in security till the murther was aton'd, either by fulfilling a certain time of banishment, or by a pecuniary mulct or expiation. I will only further remark the conciseness of these interrogations of Theoclymenus; he asks four questions in a breath, in the compass of one line; his apprehensions of being pursu'd give him no leisure to expatiate. Homer judiciously adapts his Poetry to the circumstances of the murtherer, a man in fear being in great haste to be in security. Telemachus answers with equal brevity, being under a necessity to finish his voyage in the night to avoid the ambush of the suitors. For this reason Homer shortens the relation, and complies with the exigency of Telemachus: With this further view; to unite the subordinate story of Telemachus with that of Ulysses, it being necessary to hasten to the chief action, and without delay carry on the main design of the Odyssey in the re-establishment of Ulysses. Prepare then, said Telemachus, to know A tale from falshood free, not free from woe. From Ithaca, of royal birth I came, And great Ulysses (ever honour'd name!) Was once my Sire: tho' now for ever lost In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost! Whose fate enquiring, thro' the world we rove; The last, the wretched proof of filial love. The Stranger then. Nor shall I ought conceal, But the dire secret of my fate reveal. Of my own tribe an Argive wretch I slew; Whose pow'rful friends the luckless deed pursue With unrelenting rage, and force from home The blood-stain'd exile, ever doom'd to roam. But bear, oh bear me o'er yon azure flood; Receive the suppliant! spare my destin'd blood! Stranger (reply'd the Prince) securely rest Affianc'd in our faith; henceforth our guest. Thus affable, Ulysses' God-like heir Takes from the stranger's hand the glitt'ring spear: He climbs the ship, ascends the stern with haste, And by his side the guest accepted plac'd. The chief his orders gives: th' obedient band With due observance wait the chief's command: With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind. Minerva calls; the ready gales obey With rapid speed to whirl them o'er the sea. Crunus they pass'd, next Chalcis roll'd away, This whole passage has been greatly corrupted; one line is omitted in all our editions of Homer, and the verses themselves are printed erroneously: for thus they stand, lib. 8. p. 539. of Strabo's Geography. ??? ?? ???? ????????, ??? ??????? ????????????, ??????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?? ????? ??????, ? ?? ???? ????????? ?????????? ???? ????. The first line is added from Strabo: thus in Latin, Præterierunt Crunos, &amp; Chalcida fluentis amœnam. He writes, ??????????, for ??????????: and ????, instead of ?????. The course that Telemachus steer'd is thus explain'd by the same Author: He first sail'd northwardly as far as Elis, then he turn'd towards the east, avoiding the direct course to Ithaca, to escape the ambush of the suitors, who lay between Samos and Ithaca. Then he pass'd the Echinades (call'd ????, that is ??????, or sharp-pointed by Homer. See Strabo, lib. 10. They are called Oxias by Pliny) lying near the gulph of Corinth, and the mouths of Achelous; thus leaving Ithaca on the east, and passing it, he alters his course again, sails northwardly between Ithaca and Acarnania, and lands on the coast opposite to the Cephallenian ocean, where the Suitors form'd their ambush. The places mention'd by Homer lie in this order, Cruni, Chalcis, and Phea: and are all rivers of small note, or rather brooks, as Strabo expresses it: ?????? ??????? ???????, ?????? ?? ??????. It is highly probable that Pheæ, and not Pheræ, is the true reading, for Pheræ lay in Messenia, and not in Elis, as Strabo writes, and was in possession of Agamemnon; for he mentions that city amongst the seven which he promises Achilles, in the ninth book of the Iliad. Sev'n ample Cities shall confess thy sway, Thee Enope, and Pheræ thee obey. If it had not been under his dominion, how could he transfer the right to Achilles? besides, it would be absurd to joyn Pheræ directly with Chalcis, when the one was in Messenia, the other in Elis; this would make the course of Telemachus's Navigation unintelligible, if Elis and Messenia were confounded in the relation, and used promiscuously without order or regularity. I will only add that Strabo in the 20th book of his Geography, instead of ????????????, reads ???????????, perhaps thro' a slip of his memory. When thick'ning darkness clos'd the doubtful day; The silver Phæa's glitt'ring Rills they lost, And skim'd along by Elis' sacred coast. Then cautious thro' the rocky reaches wind, And turning sudden, shun the death design'd. Mean-time the King, Eumæus, and the rest, Sate in the Cottage, at their rural feast: The banquet past, and satiate ev'ry man, To try his host Ulysses thus began. Yet one night more, my friends, indulge your guest, The last I purpose in your walls to rest: To-morrow for my self I must provide, And only ask your counsel, and a guide: Patient to roam the street, by hunger led, And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread. There in Ulysses' roof I may relate Ulysses' wand'rings to his royal mate; Or mingling with the suitors haughty train, Not undeserving, some support obtain. Hermes to me his various gifts imparts, Mercury was the servant and minister of the Gods, and was feign'd to be the patron of all persons of the like station upon earth; it was supposed to be by his favour that all servants and attendants were successful in their several functions. In this view the connexion will be easy, “I will go (says Ulysses) and offer my service to the suitors, and by the favour of Mercury, who gives success to persons of my condition, shall prosper; for no man is better able to execute the offices of attendance, than my self.” It may be objected, that these functions are unworthy of the character, and beneath the dignity of an Heroe: but Ulysses is obliged to act in his assum'd, not real character; as a beggar, not as a King. Athenæus (lib. 1. p. 18.) vindicates Ulysses in another manner. “Men (says he) in former ages perform'd their own offices, and gloried in their dexterity in such employments. Thus Homer describes Ulysses as the most dextrous man living, in ordering wood for the fire, and in the arts of cookery.” But it is no more derogation to him to put on the appearance of a beggar, than it was to Pallas to assume that of a swain, as she frequently does throughout the Odyssey. Patron of industry and manual arts: Few can with me in dext'rous works contend, The pyre to build, the stubborn oak to rend; To turn the tasteful viand o'er the flame; Or foam the goblet with a purple stream. Such are the tasks of men of mean estate, Whom Fortune dooms to serve the rich and great, Alas! (Eumæus with a sigh rejoin'd) How sprung a thought so monstrous in thy mind? If on that god-less race thou wouldst attend, Fate owes thee sure a miserable end! Their wrongs and blasphemies ascend the sky, The sense of this passage appears to me very obvious; Dacier renders it, whose violence and insolence is so great, that they regard not the Gods, and that they attack even the heavens. I should rather chuse to understand the words in the more plain and easy construction: Grotius is of this judgment, and thinks they bear the same import as these in Gen. xviii. 21. I will go down and see if they have done according to the cry which is come unto heaven; and indeed there is a great similitude between the expressions. And pull descending vengeance from on high. Not such, my friend, the servants of their feast: A blooming train in rich embroid'ry drest, With earth's whole tribute the bright table bends, And smiling round celestial Youth attends. Stay then: no eye askance beholds thee here; Sweet is thy converse to each social ear; Well pleas'd, and pleasing, in our cottage rest, Till good Telemachus accepts his guest With genial gifts, and change of fair attires, And safe conveys thee where thy soul desires. To him the Man of woes. O gracious Jove! Reward this stranger's hospitable love, Who knows the son of sorrow to relieve, Chears the sad heart, nor lets affliction grieve. Of all the ills unhappy mortals know, A life of wand'rings is the greatest woe: On all their weary ways wait Care and Pain, And Pine and Penury, a meagre train. To such a man since harbour you afford, Relate the farther fortunes of your Lord; What cares his Mother's tender breast engage, And Sire, forsaken on the verge of age; These questions may seem to be needless, because Ulysses had been fully acquainted with the story of Laertes, and the Death of his mother Anticlea, by the shade of Tiresias; but Ulysses personates a stranger, and to carry on that character, pretends to be unacquainted with all the affairs of his own family. I cannot affirm that such frequent repetitions of the same circumstances are beautiful in Homer; the retirement of Laertes has been frequently mention'd, and the death of Anticlea related in other parts of the Odyssey; however necessary such reiterated accounts may be, I much question whether they will prove entertaining: Homer himself in this place seems to apprehend it, for Eumæus passes over the questions made by Ulysses with a very short answer, and enlarges upon other circumstances, relating to his family and affairs, to give (as Eustathius observes) variety to his Poetry. But this conduct is very judicious upon another account: It lets Ulysses into the knowledge of his condition, and by it he is able to take his measures with the greater certainty, in order to bring about his own re-establishment. This is a demonstration that the objection of Rapin is without foundation; he calls these interviews between Ulysses and Eumæus mere idle fables, invented solely for amusement, and contributing nothing to the action of the Odyssey; but the contrary is true, for Ulysses directs his course according to these informations. Beneath the sun prolong they yet their breath, Or range the house of darkness and of death? To whom the Swain. Attend what you enquire. Laertes lives, the miserable sire, Lives, but implores of ev'ry pow'r to lay The burden down, and wishes for the day. Torn from his offspring in the eve of life, Torn from th' embraces of his tender wife, Sole, and all comfortless he wastes away, Old age untimely posting ere his day. She too, sad Mother! for Ulysses lost Pin'd out her bloom, and vanish'd to a ghost. (So dire a fate, ye righteous Gods! avert, From ev'ry friendly, ev'ry feeling heart!) While yet she was, tho' clouded o'er with grief, Her pleasing converse minister'd relief: With Ctimene, her youngest daughter, bred, One roof contain'd us, and one table fed. But when the softly-stealing pace of time Crept on from childhood into youthful prime, To Samos' Isle she sent the wedded fair; Me to the fields, to tend the rural care; Array'd in garments her own hands had wove, Nor less the darling object of her love. Her hapless death my brighter days o'ercast, Yet Providence deserts me not at last; My present labours food and drink procure, And more, the pleasure to relieve the poor. This verse, ??? ????????, ???????, ??? ?????????? ?????. has been traduc'd into the utmost obscenity; Eustathius vindicates the expression: It means “I have sustain'd my self with meat and drink by an honest industry, and have got wherewithal to relieve virtue that wants.” He interprets ??????????, by ???????? ?????? ??????; or, men worthy of regard and honour: ?????? ??? ???????. The following words, ? ?? ???????? ????? ??????? ???? ????, ???? ??????? ? are capable of a double construction, and imply either that I take no delight in hearing of Penelope, she being in distress, and in the power of the suitors; or that the suitors so besiege the palace, that it is impossible for me to hear one gentle word from Penelope, or receive one obliging action from her hand. The preference is submitted to the Reader's judgment; they both contain images of tenderness and humanity. Small is the comfort from the Queen to hear Unwelcome news, or vex the royal ear; Blank and discountenanc'd the servants stand, Nor dare to question where the proud command: No profit springs beneath usurping pow'rs; Want feeds not there, where Luxury devours, Nor harbours Charity where Riot reigns: Proud are the lords, and wretched are the swains. The suff'ring chief at this began to melt; And, oh Eumæus! thou (he cries) hast felt The spite of fortune too! her cruel hand Snatch'd thee an infant from thy native land! Snatch'd from thy parents arms, thy parents eyes, To early wants! a man of miseries! Thy whole sad story, from its first, declare: Sunk the fair City by the rage of war, Where once thy parents dwelt? or did they keep In humbler life, the lowing herds and sheep? So left perhaps to tend the fleecy train, Rude Pyrates seiz'd, and shipp'd thee o'er the main? Doom'd a fair prize to grace some Prince's board, The worthy purchase of a foreign lord. If then my fortunes can delight my friend, A story fruitful of events, attend: Another's sorrow may thy ear enjoy, And wine the lengthen'd intervals employ. Long nights the now-declining year bestows; From hence we may conclude, that the return of Ulysses was probably in the decline of the year, in the latter part of the autumn, and not in the summer; the nights then being short cannot be called ?????? ?????????. Eustathius. A part we consecrate to soft repose, A part in pleasing talk we entertain; For too much rest itself becomes a pain. This aphorism is agreeable to nature and experience; the same thing is asserted by Hippocrates, Sleep or watchfulness, when excessive, becomes diseases; too much sleep occasions an access of perspiration, and consequently weakens and dissipates the animal spirits. Dacier. Let those, whom sleep invites, the call obey, Their cares resuming with the dawning day: Here let us feast, and to the feast be join'd Discourse, the sweeter banquet of the mind; Review the series of our lives, and taste There is undoubtedly a great pleasure in the remembrance of past sufferings: Nay, calamity has this advantage over prosperity; an evil when past turns into a comfort; but a past pleasure, though innocent, leaves in its room an anxiety for the want of it, and if it be a guilty pleasure, a remorse. The reason (observes Eustathius) why past evils delight, is from the consciousness of the praise due to our prudence and patience under them, from the sense of our felicity in being deliver'd from them, and from gratitude to divine providence, which has deliver'd us. It is the joy of good men to believe themselves the favourites of Heaven. The melancholy joy of evils past: For he who much has suffer'd, much will know; And pleas'd remembrance builds delight on woe. Above Ortygia This is an antient name of Delos, so call'd from ?????, a Quail, from the great numbers of those birds found upon that Island. Lycophron, in his obscure way of writing, calls it ????? ?????????? or the winged Quail; perhaps from the fable of Asteria being turn'd into that bird in her flight from Jupiter, and giving name to the Island from the transformation she suffer'd upon it. It is one of the Cyclades, and lies in the Ægean ocean. Syria, or Syros, is another small Island lying eastward of Ithaca, according to true Geography. Far hence remote, and Syria is the name; (There curious eyes inscrib'd with wonder trace The words in Homer are ?????? ???????, or solis conversiones. Monsieur Perrault insults the Poet as ignorant of Geography, for placing Syros under the Tropick; an error (says he) which Commentators in vain have labour'd to defend, by having recourse to a Sun-dial of Pherecydes on which the motions of the Sun (the ?????? ???????) were design'd. The last defence would indeed be ridiculous, since Pherecydes flourish'd three hundred years after the time of Homer: No one (replies Monsieur Boileau) was ever at any difficulty about the sense of this passage; Eustathius proves that ????????? signifies the same as ??????, and denotes the setting of the Sun; so that the words mean, that Syros is situate above Ortygia, on that side where the Sun sets, or westerly, ???? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ????????. 'Tis true, Eustathius mentions a bower, ????????, in which the conversions of the Sun were figur'd. This indeed would fully vindicate Homer; but Bochart and others affirm, that Eustathius is in an error, and that Syros is so far from lying to the west, or ???? ?????? ???????, that it bears an eastern position both with respect to Ithaca and Delos: How is this objection to be answer'd? Bochart p. 411. of his Geographia sacra, explains it by having recourse to the bower mention'd by Eustathius, in which the motions of the Sun were drawn. Pherecydes (says Hesychius Milesius) having collected the writings of the Phœnicians, from the use of them alone without any instructor, became famous in the world by the strength of his own genius: And Laertius writes, that an Heliotrope made by him was preserv'd in the Island of Syros. Thus it is evident, that he borrow'd his knowledge from the Phœnicians, and probably his skill in Astronomy, they being very expert in that science, by reason of its use in their navigation. Why then might there not be a machine which exhibited the motions of the Sun, made by the Phœnicians, and why might not Homer be acquainted with it? It is probable that Pherecydes took his pattern from this Heliotrope, which being one of the greatest rarities of antiquity, might give a great reputation to Syros, and consequently was worthy to be celebrated by Homer, the great preserver of Antiquities. Fallitur igitur, (says Bochart) Eustathius, cum vult intelligi, quasi sita sit Syrus ad occiduas partes Deli; cum contra Deli ad ortum sit Syrus, non ad occasum; &amp; rem sic se habere ex ipso Homero patet, apud quem Eumæus in Ithaca, Syriam asserit esse trans Delum, quo nihil dici potuit falsius, si Syrus sit ad occasum Deli. If this answer appears to any person too studied and abstruse, the difficulty may be solv'd, by supposing Eumæus speaking of Delos as it lay with respect to Syrus, before he was carry'd from it; for instance, if Syrus lies on the east of Delos to a man in Ithaca, both Ithaca and Delos will lie on the west of Syrus to one of that Island; I would therefore imagine that Eumæus speaks as a native of Syros, and not as a sojourner in Ithaca, and then Delos will lie towards the sun-setting, or ???? ????? ??????: But this last I only propose as a conjecture, not presuming to offer it as a decision. The Sun's diurnal, and his annual race) Not large, but fruitful; stor'd with grass to keep It is probable that Homer was well acquainted with the nature of this Island, and that it really enjoy'd an admirable temperature of air, and therefore was exceedingly heathful; the fertility of the soil proves the happiness of the air, which would naturally free the inhabitants from the maladies arising from a less salubrious situation. It is for this reason that they are said to be slain by Diana and Apollo. All deaths that were sudden, and without sickness, were ascrib'd to those Deities. Bochart (p. 410.) tells us, that the name of Syros was given to the Island by the Phœnicians; Asira or Sira signifying rich, in their language; or rather it was so called from Sura, or Asura, signifying happy; either of these derivations fully denote the excellence both of the soil and air: and that this name is of Phœnician extract is probable from the words of Homer, who assures us that they stay'd a whole year upon this Island, and consequently had opportunity to know the healthfulness and fertility of it. The bellowing oxen, and the bleating sheep; Her sloping hills the mantling vines adorn, And her rich vallies wave with golden corn. No want, no famine the glad natives know, Nor sink by sickness to the shades below; But when a length of years unnerves the strong. Apollo comes, and Cynthia comes along, They bend the silver bow with tender skill, And void of pain, the silent arrows kill. Two equal tribes this fertile land divide, Where two fair cities rise with equal pride, But both in constant peace one Prince obey, And Ctesius there, my father, holds the sway. Freighted, it seems, with toys of ev'ry sort A ship of Sidon anchor'd in our port; Here is a full testimony, that the Phœnicians were remarkable for arts and navigation over all the old world. They were expuls'd from their country by Joshua, (as Bochart informs us) and then settling along the sea coasts, they spread over all the Mediterranean, and by degrees sent out Colonies into Europe, Asia, and Afric; that they were in Afric appears from Procopius, where he mentions a pillar with a Phœnician inscription. ????? ????? ?? ???????? ??????????? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ????; that is, We are a people that fly from Joshua the son of Nun, the robber; they gave him that title out of resentment for their dispossession. The character they bear in the Scriptures agrees with this in Homer. Isaiah xxiii. 2. The Merchants of Sidon, that pass over the seas; and it likewise appears from the Scriptures, that they excell'd in all arts of embroidery, and works of curiosity. What-time it chanc'd the palace entertain'd, I was surpriz'd to find that Eustathius mistook this Phœnician woman for the mother of Eumæus; she herself tells us, that she was only his Governess. ????? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ???????? ????????. It is not probable that Eumæus would have painted his own mother in the dress of an adultress, and an abandon'd traytress: Nay, he directly distinguishes his mother from this Phœnician in the sequel of the story, (where he calls her ?????? ?????, or his venerable mother) and when he speaks of the Phœnician, he constantly calls her ????, not ?????. Nor indeed could he have call'd her ?????? at all, if she had not been a person of such a detestable character. Spondanus adopts the mistake of Eustathius, and endeavours to vindicate her from the manner of her frailty. Modeste decepta donis, &amp;c. ut eorum libidine obsecundaret, “it was a modest adultery, she being deceived by bribes to yield to their solicitation.” However erroneous this opinion is, yet it shews Spondanus to be a kind and complaisant Casuist. Skill'd in rich works, a woman of their land. This nymph, where anchor'd the Phœnician train To wash her robes descending to the main, A smooth-tongu'd sailor won her to his mind; (For Love deceives the best of woman-kind.) A sudden trust from sudden liking grew; She told her name, her race, and all she knew. I too (she cry'd) from glorious Sidon came, My father Arybas, of wealthy fame; But snatch'd by pyrates from my native place, The Taphians sold me to this man's embrace. Haste then (the false designing youth reply'd) Haste to thy country; love shall be thy guide: Haste to thy father's house, thy father's breast, For still he lives, and lives with riches blest. “Swear first (she cry'd) ye sailors! to restore “A wretch in safety to her native shore. Swift as she ask'd, the ready sailors swore. She then proceeds: Now let our compact made Be nor by signal nor by word betray'd, Nor near me any of your crew descry'd By road frequented, or by fountain-side. Be Silence still our guard. The Monarch's spies (For watchful Age is ready to surmize) Are still at hand; and this reveal'd must be Death to your selves, eternal chains to me. Your vessel loaded, and your traffic past, Dispatch a wary messenger with haste: Then gold and costly treasures will I bring, And more, the infant offspring of the King. Him, child-like wand'ring forth, I'll lead away, (A noble prize!) and to your ship convey. Thus spoke the dame, and homeward took the road. A year they traffic, and their vessel load. Their stores compleat, and ready now to weigh, A spy was sent their summons to convey: An artist to my father's palace came, With gold and amber chains, elab'rate frame: Each female eye the glitt'ring links employ, They turn, review, and cheapen ev'ry toy. He took th' occasion as they stood intent, Gave her the sign, and to his vessel went. She strait pursu'd, and seiz'd my willing arm; I follow'd smiling, innocent of harm. There is a little incredibility in this narration: for if Eumæus was such an infant as he is describ'd to be at the time when he was betray'd by his Phœnician Governess, what probability is there that he should be able to retain all these particulars so circumstantially? He was not of an age capable of making, or remembring so many observations. The answer is, that he afterwards learn'd them from Laertes, who bought him of the Phœnicians: and no doubt they told him the quality of Eumæus, to enhance the Price and make the better bargain. It is also natural to imagine, that Eumæus, when he grew up to manhood, would be inquisitive after his own birth and fortunes, and therefore might probably learn these particulars from Laertes. Eustathius. Three golden goblets in the porch she found, (The guests not enter'd, but the table crown'd) Hid in her fraudful bosom, these she bore: Now set the sun, and darken'd all the shore. Arriving then, where tilting on the tydes Prepar'd to launch the freighted vessel rides; Aboard they heave us, mount their decks, and sweep With level oar along the glassy deep. Six calmy daysand six smooth nights we sail, It is evident from this passage, that it is above six days sail from Ithaca to Syros, tho' carried with favourable winds. Dacier. And constant Jove supply'd the gentle gale. The sev'nth, the fraudful wretch, (no cause descry'd) Touch'd by Diana's vengeful arrow, I would just observe the poetical justice of Homer, in the punishment of this Phœnician. Misfortune generally pursues wickedness, and tho' we escape the vengeance of man, yet heav'n frequently overtakes us when we think we are in security, and death calls us from our impious acquisitions. Down dropt the caitiff corse, a worthless load, Down to the deep; there roll'd the future food Of fierce sea-wolves, and monsters of the flood. An helpless infant I remain'd behind; Thence born to Ithaca by wave and wind; Sold to Laertes, by divine command, And now adopted to a foreign land. Homer has here given us an History of the life of Eumæus; the Episode contains near an hundred lines, and may seem entirely foreign to the action of the Odyssey. I will not affirm that it is in every respect to be justify'd. The main story is at a stand; but we are to consider that this relation takes up but small part of one leisure evening, and that the action cannot proceed till the return of Telemachus. It is of use to set off the character of Eumæus, and shew him to be a person of quality, worthy to be an agent in an Epic Poem, where every character ought to be remote from meanness: So the story has a distant relation to the Odyssey, and perhaps is not to be look'd upon merely as an excrescence from the main building, but a small projection to adorn it. To him the King. Reciting thus thy cares, My secret soul in all thy sorrows shares: But one choice blessing (such as Jove's high will) Has sweeten'd all thy bitter draught of ill: Torn from thy country to no hapless end, The Gods have, in a master, giv'n a friend. Whatever frugal nature needs is thine, (For she needs little) daily bread and wine. While I, so many wand'rings past and woes, Live but on what thy poverty bestows. So past in pleasing dialogue away The night; then down to short repose they lay; 'Till radiant rose the messenger of day. This is the morning of the thirty eighth day since the beginning of the Odyssey. 'Tis observable that Telemachus takes more time in his return from Pylos, than in sailing thither from his own country; for in the latter end of the second book he sets sail after sun-setting, and reach'd Pyle in the morning: Here he embarks in the afternoon, and yet arrives not at Ithaca till after break of day. The reason of it is not to be ascrib'd to a less prosperous wind, but to the greater compass he was oblig'd to fetch, to escape the ambush of the suitors. In the former voyage he steer'd a direct course; in this, he sails round about to the north of Ithaca, and therefore wastes more time in his voyage to it. While in the port of Ithaca, the band Of young Telemachus approach'd the land; Their sails they loos'd, they lash'd the mast aside, And cast their anchors, and the cables ty'd: Then on the breezy shore descending, join In grateful banquet o'er the rosy wine. When thus the Prince: Now each his course pursue; I to the fields, and to the city you. Long absent hence, I dedicate this day My swains to visit, and the works survey. Expect me with the morn, to pay the skies Our debt of safe return, in feast and sacrifice. Then Theoclymenus. But who shall lend, Mean-time, protection to thy stranger-friend? Strait to the Queen and Palace shall I fly, Or yet more distant, to some Lord apply? The Prince return'd. Renown'd in days of yore Has stood our Father's hospitable door; No other roof a stranger shou'd receive, Nor other hands than ours the welcome give. But in my absence riot fills the place, Nor bears the modest Queen a stranger's face, From noiseful revel far remote she flies, But rarely seen, or seen with weeping eyes. No—let Eurymachus receive my guest, Of nature courteous, and by far the best; He wooes the Queen with more respectful flame, And emulates her former husband's fame: The words in the original are ???????? ????? ?????, which may either be render'd, to obtain the honour of marrying Penelope, agreebly to the former part of the verse; or it means that Eurymachus has the fairest hopes to marry Penelope, and obtain the throne or ????? of Ulysses. Hobbs translates the verse almost obscenely in the former sense: ? He best loves my mother, And what my father did, would do the same. The former in my judgment is the better construction, especially because it avoids a tautology, and gives a new image in the second part of the verse, very different from the sense express'd in the former part of it. But of all the meanings it is capable of I should prefer this; “That he courts her upon the most honourable principles, and seems desirous to have the honour of Ulysses, by imitating his worth”; and this is agreeable to the character of Eurymachus, which distinguishes him from all the other Suitors. With what success, 'tis Jove's alone to know, And the hop'd nuptials turn to joy or woe. Thus speaking, on the right up-soar'd in air The hawk, Apollo's swift-wing'd messenger; The Augury is thus to be interpreted; Ulysses is the hawk, the Suitors the pidgeon; the hawk denotes the valour of Ulysses, being a bird of prey; the pigeon represents the cowardice of the Suitors, that bird being remarkable for her timorous nature. The hawk flies on the right, to denote success to Ulysses. Homer calls this bird the Messenger of Apollo; not that this augury was sent by that Deity, (tho' that be no forced interpretation) but the expression implies, that the hawk was sacred to Apollo; as the peacock was to Juno, the owl to Pallas, and the eagle to Jupiter. Thus Ælian, anim. lib. 10. c. 14. ????????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????? ????? ???????, &amp;c. and he gives the reason of it, for the hawk is the only bird that is capable to bear the lustre of the Sun without inconvenience and difficulty; the same is said of the eagle, but this hawk is reckon'd to be of the Aquiline kind. It was death among the Ægyptians to kill this bird, because it was dedicated to Apollo. There is another reason why any bird that was taken notice of by way of augury, may be said to be the messenger of Apollo: that Deity presiding over divination. His deathful pounces tore a trembling dove; The clotted feathers scatter'd from above Between the Heroe and the Vessel pour Thick plumage, mingled with a sanguine show'r. Th' observing Augur took the Prince aside, The reason why Theoclymenus withdraws Telemachus, while he interprets the Augury, is not apparent at the first view; but he does it out of an apprehension lest he should be over-heard by some of the company, who might disclose the secret to the Suitors, and such a discovery might prove fatal to his own person, or to the fortunes of Telemachus Eustathius. Seiz'd by the hand, and thus prophetic cry'd. Yon bird that dexter cuts th' aerial road, Rose ominous, nor flies without a God: No race but thine shall Ithaca obey, To thine, for ages, heav'n decrees the sway. Succeed the Omen, Gods! (the youth rejoin'd) Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind, And soon each envy'd happiness attend The man, who calls Telemachus his friend. Then to Peiræus—Thou whom time has prov'd We find that Telemachus intended to deliver Theoclymenus to the care of Eurymachus: What then is the reason why he thus suddenly alters that resolution, and intrusts him to Peiræus? This is occasion'd by the discovery of the skill of Theoclymenus in Augury: He fears lest the Suitors should extort some prediction from him that might be detrimental to his affairs, or should he refuse it, to the person of Theoclymenus. Eustathius. A faithful servant, by thy Prince belov'd! Till we returning shall our guest demand, Accept this charge, with honour, at our hand. To this Peiræus; Joyful I obey, Well pleas'd the hospitable rites to pay. The presence of thy guest shall best reward (If long thy stay) the absence of my Lord. This book comprehends somewhat more than the space of two days and one night; for the vision appears to Telemachus a little before the dawn, in the night preceding the thirty sixth day, and he lands in Ithaca on the thirty eighth in the morning. With that, their anchors he commands to weigh, Mount the tall bark, and launch into the sea. All with obedient haste forsake the shores, And plac'd in order, spread their equal oars. Then from the deck the Prince his sandals takes; Pois'd in his hand the pointed jav'lin shakes. They part; while less'ning from the Hero's view, Swift to the town the well-row'd gally flew: The Heroe trod the margin of the main, And reach'd the mansion of his faithful swain. THE SIXTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Discovery of Ulysses to Telemachus. Telemachus arriving at the lodge of Eumæus sends him to carry Penelope the news of his return. Minerva appearing to Ulysses commands him to discover himself to his son. The Princes, who had lain in ambush to intercept Telemachus in his way, their project being defeated, return to Ithaca. Soon as the morning blush'd along the plains, This Book opens with the greatest simplicity imaginable. Dionysius Halicarnasseus quotes the sixteen first Lines to this purpose: The Poet, says that Author, describes a low and vulgar action, yet gives it an inexpressible sweetness; the ear is pleased with the harmony of the Poetry, and yet there is nothing noble in the sentiments. Whence, continues he, does this arise? from the choice of the words, or from the placing of them? No one will affirm that it consists in the choice of the words, for the diction is entirely low and vulgar, so vulgar that a common Artificer or Peasant, who never studied elocution, would use it in conversation; turn the Verses into Prose, and this will appear. There are no transpositions, no figures, no variety of dialect, nor any new and studied expressions. Where then is the beauty of the Poetry? It must be entirely ascrib'd to the harmonious juncture and position of the words; and he concludes that the collocation of words has a greater efficacy both in Prose and Poetry, than the choice. And indeed a judicious Disposition of them (like what is feign'd of Minerva in this Book) makes a mean, deform'd, and vulgar period, rise, like Ulysses from beggary, into pomp and dignity. This may be exemplify'd from the rules of mechanic arts: an architect, when he gathers his materials for a building, has these three things chiefly in view: first, with what piece of stone, wood, &amp;c. a correspondent piece will best agree: next he considers their several formations, and how it will best stand in the structure; and lastly, if any part of the materials suits not with the allotted place, he rejects it or new shapes it, till it agrees with the whole work: The same care is to be taken by a good writer: he is first to consider what Noun or Verb is to be join'd to other Nouns or Verbs so fitly, as not possibly to be plac'd more conveniently; for a promiscuous connecting of words indiscriminately spoils both Prose and Poetry: Next he considers the frame and turn of the Verb or Noun, and how it will stand in the place he allots it; and if it suits not exactly, he changes it, sometimes by varying the Numbers, sometimes the Cases, and at other times the Genders: And lastly, if a word prove so stubborn as not to bend to the level of the period, he entirely rejects it, and introduces another that preserves a due conformity; or at least, if an harmonious word be necessary, he places it so judiciously between more agreeable and tuneful words, that their harmony steals away our imagination from observing the roughness of the others: Like wise Generals, who in ordering the ranks of their Soldiers, strengthen the weaker files by sustaining them with the stronger; and by this method render the whole invincible. See likewise Cap. 32. of Longinus, of the disposition of words. Ulysses, and the Monarch of the Swains, Awake the sleeping fires, their meal prepare, The word in the original is ???????, which here denotes very evidently the morning repast: it is used but in one other place in all Homer in this sense: Iliad. Lib. 24. V. 124. ????????? ???????? ??? ???????? ??????? But we are not therefore to imagine that this was an usual meal; Homer in other places expresses it by ???????, as is observed by Athenæus, Lib. 1. ?? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? ??? ?? ?0???? ??????????. “At the dawn of the day they took repast and arm'd themselves for battle”. The Greeks had three customary meals, which are distinctly mention'd by Palamedes in Æschylus, ??????, ??????, ??????? ????????? ?????. Homer, adds Athenæus, mentions a fourth repast, Lib. 17. of the Odyssey: ? ?? ?? ????? ??????????. This the Romans call'd commessationem, we a collation, a repast taken, as the same Author explains it, between dinner and supper; the word is deriv'd ??? ???? ?????? ?????? ?????, or the evening twilight. But Athenæus refutes himself, lib. 5. p. 193. I have already (says he) observ'd that the Antients eat thrice a-day; and 'tis ridiculous to imagine that they eat four times, from these words of Homer, ? ?? ?? ????? ??????????. For that expression meant only that Eumæus should return in the evening, ???????? ????????? ??????. But this is not the full import of the word ??????????, for it undoubtedly means, To take the evening repast or supper, as is evident from the conclusion of the seventeenth Book of the Odyssey: Return, says Telemachus to Eumæus, but first take refreshment; and Eumæus accordingly eats, and the Poet immediately adds, because the Evening was come, or ??????? ??????? ????. However in no sense can this word be brought to prove that the Greeks eat four times in the day: but if any person will imagine that it signifies in that place an immediate meal, all that can be gather'd from it is, that Telemachus out of kindness to Eumæus commands him to eat before the usual hour of repast, before he leaves his palace: but Hesychius rightly interprets it by ?? ???????? ????? ???????? that is, eating his supper; for as ??????? and ??????? signify the dinner, so ?????? and ???????? denote the time of supper promiscuously. I will add no more, but refer the Reader for a full Explication of ???????, ??????? and ????????, to Lib. 8. Question 6. of Plutarch's Symposiacs. And forth to pasture send the bristly care. The Prince's near approach the dogs descry, And fawning round his feet, confess their joy. Their gentle blandishment the King survey'd, Heard his resounding step, and instant said: Some well-known friend (Eumæus) bends this way; His steps I hear; the dogs familiar play. While yet he spoke, the Prince advancing drew Nigh to the lodge, and now appear'd in view. Transported from his seat Eumæus sprung, Drop'd the full bowl In the original it is, Eumæus drop'd the bowl as he temper'd it with water. It was customary not to drink wine unmix'd amongst the antients; there was no certain proportion observ'd in the mixture, some to one vessel of wine pour'd in two of water, others to two of wine, five of water. Homer tells us that the wine of Maron was so strong as to require twenty measures of water to one of wine; but perhaps this is spoken hyperbolically, to shew the uncommon strength of it. The Lacedemonians us'd to boil their wine till the fifth part was consum'd, and then keeping it four years, drank it: but sometimes the Grecians drank it without water (but this they call'd reproachfully ???????????, or to act like a Scythian, from whom they borrow'd the custom.) It was usual even for Children to drink wine thus temper'd, amongst the Grecians; thus in this Book Eurymachus ? ?????? ?? ????? ???????. And Phœnix in the 9th of the Iliads, speaking of Achilles ? ????? ???????. ??????? ??? ??????????. At Athens there was an altar erected to Bacchus ??????, because from thus tempering the wine men return'd upright or sober from entertainments; and a law was enacted by Amphitryon, and afterwards reviv'd by Solon, that no unmix'd wine should be drank at any entertainment., and round his bosom hung; Kissing his cheek, his hand, while from his eye The tears rain'd copious in a show'r of joy. As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves, From foreign climes an only son receives, (Child of his age) with strong paternal joy Forward he springs, and clasps the favourite boy: So round the youth his arms Eumæus spread, As if the grave had giv'n him from the dead. And is it thou? my ever dear delight! O art thou come to bless my longing sight! Never, I never hop'd to view this day, When o'er the waves you plow'd the desp'rate way. Enter, my child! beyond my hopes restor'd, O give these eyes to feast upon their lord. Enter, oh seldom seen! for lawless pow'rs Too much detain thee from these sylvan bow'rs. The Prince reply'd; Eumæus, I obey; To seek thee, friend, I hither took my way. But say, if in the court the Queen reside Severely chaste, or if commenc'd a bride? Homer here makes use of a proverbial expression. It may thus be literally translated, Or say if obstinate no more to wed, She dooms to spiders nets th' imperial bed? Telemachus means by this question, if Penelope be determin'd no more to marry; for the marriage-bed was esteem'd so sacred, that upon the decease or absence of the husband, it remain'd unus'd. Eustathius quotes the same expression from other Authors of ?? ?? ??)????? ???????? ???????. “You shall clear the vessels from spiders webs”; meaning that you shall have so full employment for your vessels, that the spiders shall no more spread their looms there. And another Poet praying for peace, wishes spiders may weave their nets upon the soldiers arms; ?????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????. Thus we find amongst the Greeks it was an expression of dignity, and apply'd to great and serious occasions; I am not certain that it is so used by the Romans. Catullus uses it jocosely, speaking of his empty purse. ? nam tui Catulli Plenus sacculus est arancarum. Plantus does the same in his Alularia: ? anne quis ædes auferat? Nam hic apud nos nihil est aliud quæsti suribus, Ita inaniis sunt oppletæ, atque araneis. I am not doubtful if it be not too mean an image for English Poetry. Thus He: and thus the Monarch of the Swains; Severely chaste Penelope remains, But lost to every joy, she wastes the day In tedious cares, and weeps the night away. He ended, and (receiving as they pass The javelin, pointed with a star of brass) They reach'd the dome; the dome with marble shin'd. His seat Ulysses to the Prince resign'd. Not so—(exclaims the Prince Nothing can more strongly represent the respect which antiquity paid to strangers, than this conduct of Telamachus: Ulysses is in rags, in the disguise of a beggar, and yet a Prince refuses to take his seat. I doubt not but every good man will be pleas'd with such instances of benevolence and humanity to his fellow-creatures; one well natur'd action is preferable to a thousand great ones, and Telemachus appears with more advantage upon this heap of hides and osiers, than a Tyrant upon his throne. with decent grace) For me, this house shall find an humbler place: T'usurp the honours due to silver hairs And rev'rend strangers, modest youth forbears. Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies, And bids the rural throne with osiers rise. There sate the Prince: the feast Eumæus spread; And heap'd the shining canisters with bread. Thick o'er the board the plenteous viands lay, The frugal remnants of the former day. This entertainment is neither to be ascrib'd to parsimony nor poverty, but to the custom and hospitality of former ages. It was a common expression among the Greeks at table, leave something for the Medes; intimating that something ought to be left for a guest that might come accidentally. Plutarch in his 7th Book of the Sympos. Question 3. commends this conduct. Eumæus (says that Author) a wise scholar of a wise master, is no way discomposed, when Telemachus pays him a visit, he immediately sets before him The frugal remnants of the former day. Besides, the table was accounted sacred to the Gods, and nothing that was sacred was permitted to be empty; this was another reason why the Antients always reserv'd part of their provisions, not solely out of hospitality to men, but piety to the Gods. Then in a bowl he tempers gen'rous wines, Around whose verge a mimic Ivy twines. And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled, Thus young Ulysses to Eumæus said. Whence father, from what shore this stranger, say? What vessel bore him o'er the wat'ry way? To human step our land impervious lies, And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise. The swain returns. A tale of sorrows hear; In spacious Crete he drew his natal air: Long doom'd to wander o'er the land and main, For heav'n has wove his thread of life with pain. Half-breathless 'scaping to the land, he flew From Thesprot mariners, a murd'rous crew. To thee my son the suppliant I resign, I gave him my protection, grant him thine. Hard task, he cries, thy virtue gives thy friend, Willing to aid, It has been observ'd that Homer intended to give us the picture of a compleat Heroe in his two Poems, drawn from the characters of Achilles and Ulysses: Achilles has consummate valour, but wants the wisdom of Ulysses: Ulysses has courage, but courage inclining to caution and stratagem, as much as that of Achilles to rashness. Virgil endeavour'd to form a compleat Heroe in Æneas, by joining in his person the forward Courage of Achilles with the wisdom of Ulysses, and by this conduct gives us a perfect character. The same observation holds good with respect to the subordinate characters introduc'd into the two Poems of the Iliad and Odyssey; and makes an essential difference between them; Thus the Iliad exhibiting an example of heroic valour, almost all the characters are violent and heroic. Diomed, Ajax, Hector, &amp;c. are all chiefly remarkable for courage: But the Odyssey being intended to represent the patience and wisdom of an Heroe, almost all the characters are distinguish'd by benevolence and humanity. Telemachus and Eumæus, Alcinous, Nestor and Menelaus are every where represented in the mild light of wisdom and hospitality. This makes a continu'd difference of style in the Poetry of the two Poems, and the characters of the agents in the Odyssey necessarily exhibit lectures of piety and morality: The Reader should keep this in his view. In reading Homer, the Odyssey is to be look'd upon as a sequel of the Iliad, and then he will find in the two Poems the perfection of human nature, consummate courage join'd with consummate piety. He must be an unobserving Reader, who has not taken notice of that Vein of humanity that runs thro' the whole Odyssey; and a bad man, that has not been pleas'd with it. In my Opinion, Eumæus tending his herds is more amiable than Achilles in all his destructive Glory. There is scarce a speech made in the Odyssey by Eumæus, Telemachus or Ulysses, but what tends to the improvement of mankind: It was this that endear'd the Odyssey to the antients, and Homer's sentences of morality were in every mouth, and introduc'd in all conversation for the better conduct of human life. This Verse was thus apply'd by some of the antients; a person being ask'd what was the Duty of an Orator, or Pleader, answer'd from Homer, ????? ??????????? ??? ??? ???????? ????????. In short, I will not deny but that the Iliad is by far the nobler Poem, with respect to the Poetry; it is fit to be read by Kings and Heroes; but the Odyssey is of use to all mankind, as it teaches us to be good men rather than great, and to prefer morality to glory. unable to defend. Can strangers safely in the court reside, Midst the swell'd insolence of lust and pride? Ev'n I unsafe: The Queen in doubt to wed, Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed? Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame, Deaf to the mighty Ulyssæan name. However, stranger! from our grace receive Such honours as befit a Prince to give; Sandals, a sword, and robes, respect to prove, And safe to sail with ornaments of love. Till then, thy guest amid the rural train Far from the court, from danger far, detain. 'Tis mine with food the hungry to supply, And cloath the naked from th'inclement sky. Here dwell in safety from the suitors wrongs, And the rude insults of ungovern'd tongues. For should'st thou suffer, pow'rless to relieve I must behold it, and can only grieve. The brave encompass'd by an hostile train, O'erpow'r'd by numbers, is but brave in vain. To whom, while anger in his bosom glows, With warmth replies the man of mighty woes. There is not a more spirited speech in all the Odyssey than this of Ulysses; his resentment arises from the last words of Telemachus, observes Eustathius: The brave encompass'd by an hostile train, O'erpow'r'd by numbers, is but brave in vain. He is preparing his son for the destruction of the Suitors, and animating him against despair, by reason of their Numbers. This he brings about, by representing that a brave man in a good cause prefers death to dishonour. By the same method Homer exalts the character of Ulysses: Telemachus thinks it impossible to resist the Suitors, Ulysses not only resists them, but almost without assistance works their destruction. There is a fine contrast between the try'd courage of Ulysses, and the inexperience of Telemachus. Since audience mild is deign'd, permit my tongue At once to pity and resent thy wrong. My heart weeps blood, to see a soul so brave Live to base insolence of pow'r a slave. But tell me, dost thou Prince, dost thou behold And hear their midnight revels uncontroul'd? Say, do thy subjects in bold faction rise, Or priests in fabled Oracles advise? Or are thy brothers, who should aid thy pow'r, Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour? O that I were from great Ulysses sprung, Or that these wither'd nerves like thine were strung; Or heav'ns! might he return! (and soon appear He shall, I trust; a Heroe scorns despair) Some antient Critics, as Eustathius informs us, rejected this Verse, and thus read the passage: ? ???? ?? ??????? ???????? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??? ????? ???? ????? ????????? ???. Then the sense will be, Oh that I were the son of Ulysses, or Ulysses himself, &amp;c. For, add they, if this Verse be admitted, it breaks the transport of Ulysses's resentment, and cools the warmth of the expression; Eustathius confesses that he was once of the same opinion, but afterwards seems dubious; for, continues he, Ulysses by saying, Oh that I were the son of Ulysses, or Ulysses himself, gave room to suspect that he was himself Ulysses; and therefore to efface this Impression, he adds with great Address, ? (and soon appear He shall, I trust; a Heroe scorns despair) And by this method removes all jealousy that might arise from his former expression. Dacier misrepresents Eustathius; she says, Il avoit donnè lieu à quelque subçon qu'il ne fust veritablement Ulysse; whereas he directly says ?? ????????? ??? ???????? ????? ? ?????, that is, “he uses this Expression, that it may not be suspected that he is Ulysses who speaks”: In reality he inserts these words solely to avoid discovery, not judging it yet seasonable to reveal himself to Telemachus, much less to Eumæus. Might he return, I yield my life a prey To my worst foe The words in Greek are ????????? ???, or, may I fall by the hand of a stranger; that is, by the worst of enemies, foreigners being usually the most barbarous enemies; This circumstance therefore aggravates the calamity. Eustathius., if that avenging day Be not their last: but should I lose my life Oppress'd by numbers in the glorious strife, I chuse the nobler part, and yield my breath Rather than bear dishonour worse than death; Than see the hand of violence invade The reverend stranger, and the spotless maid; Than see the wealth of Kings consum'd in waste, The drunkards revel, and the gluttons feast. Thus he, with anger flashing from his eye; Sincere the youthful Heroe made reply. Nor leagu'd in factious arms my subjects rise, Nor priests in fabled oracles advise; Nor are my brothers who should aid my pow'r Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour. Ah me! I boast no brother; heav'n's dread King Gives from our stock an only branch to spring: Alone Laertes reign'd Arcesius' heir, Alone Ulysses drew the vital air, And I alone the bed connubial grac'd, Homer mentions but one son of Ulysses; other authors name another, Archesilaus; and Sophocles, Eurylaus slain by Telemachus; but perhaps these descended not from Penelope, but Concubines. Eustathius. And unblest offspring of a sire unblest! Each neighb'ring realm conducive to our woe Sends forth her peers, and every peer a foe: The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills, And lofty Zacinth crown'd with shady hills. Ev'n Ithaca and all her Lords invade Th' imperial scepter, and the regal bed: The Queen averse to love, yet aw'd by pow'r, Seems half to yield, yet flies the bridal hour: Mean-time their licence uncontroul'd I bear; Ev'n now they envy me the vital air: But heav'n will sure revenge, and Gods there are. But go, Eumæus! to the Queen impart There is nothing more wonderful in Homer, than the distribution of his incidents; and how fully must he be possess'd of his whole subject, and take it in all at one view, to bring about the several parts of it naturally? Minerva in the beginning of the fifteenth Book commanded Telemæchus to dispatch Eumæus to Penelope, to inform her of his return. Here this command is executed: but is this all the use the Poet makes of that Errand? It is evident it is not: This command furnishes him with a natural occasion for the removal of Eumæus while Ulysses discovers himself to Telemachus. But why might not the discovery have been made before Eumæus? It was suitable to the cautious character of Ulysses not to trust the knowledge of his person to too many people: besides, if he had here reveal'd himself to Eumæus, there would not have been room for the discovery which is made in the future parts of the Odyssey, and consequently the Reader had been robb'd of the pleasure of it: and it must be allow'd, that the several concealments and discoveries of Ulysses thro' the Odyssey add no small pleasure and beauty to it. Our safe return, and ease a mother's heart. Yet secret go; for numerous are my foes, And here at least I may in peace repose. To whom the swain, I hear, and I obey: But old Laertes weeps his life away, And deems thee lost: shall I my speed employ To bless his age, a messenger of joy? The mournful hour that tore his son away Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray; Yet busied with his slaves, to ease his woe, He drest the vine, and bad the garden blow, Nor food nor wine refus'd: but since the day That you to Pylos plow'd the wat'ry way, Nor wine nor food he tastes; but sunk in woes, Wild springs the vine, no more the garden blows. Shut from the walks of men, to pleasure lost, Pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost. Wretched old man! (with tears the Prince returns) Yet cease to go—what man so blest but mourns? Eustathius reads the words differently, either ????????? ???, or ???????? ???. If we use the former reading, it will be understood according to the recited translation; if the latter, it must then be referr'd to Telemachus, and imply, let us cease to inform Laertes, though we grieve for him. I suppose some Critics were shock'd at the words in the former sense, and thought it cruel in Telemachus not to relieve the sorrows of Laertes, which were occasion'd chiefly thro' fondness to his person: Dacier is fully of this opinion: Eustathius prefers neither of the lections: I doubt not but Homer wrote ????????? ???; this agrees with the whole context. Wretched old man! (with tears the Prince returns) Yet cease to go—what man so blest but mourns? Were every wish indulg'd by fav'ring skies, This hour should give Ulysses to my eyes. And as for the cruelty of Telemachus, in forbidding Eumæus to go to Laertes, there is no room for this objection: he guards against it, by requesting Penelope to give him immediate information; which might be done almost as soon by a messenger from her, as by Eumæus. Besides, such a messenger to Laertes would be entirely foreign to the Poem; for his knowledge of the return of Telemachus could contribute nothing to the design of the Odyssey: Whereas the information given to Penelope has this effect; it puts the Suitors upon new measures, and instructs her how to regulate her own conduct with regard to them; and therefore the Poet judiciously dwells upon this, and passes over the other. Were every wish indulg'd by fav'ring skies, This hour shou'd give Ulysses to my eyes. But to the Queen with speed dispatchful bear Our safe return, and back with speed repair: And let some handmaid of her train resort To good Laertes in his rural court. While yet he spoke, impatient of delay He brac'd his sandals on, and strode away: Then from the heav'ns the martial Goddess flies Thro' the wide fields of air, and cleaves the skies; In form, a virgin Some of the antient Philosophers thought the Poets guilty of impiety, in representing the Gods assuming human appearances; Plato in particular (lib. 2. de Repub.) speaks with great severity. “If a God (says that Author) changes his own shape, must he assume a more or less perfect form? undoubtedly a shape less perfect; for a Deity, as a Deity, can want no perfection; therefore all change must be for the worse: now it is absurd to imagine that a Deity can be willing to assume imperfection, for this would be a degradation unworthy of a divine Power, and consequently it is absurd to imagine that a Deity can be willing to change the form of a Deity; it therefore follows, that the Gods enjoying a perfection of nature, must eternally and unchangeably appear in it”. Let no Poet therefore (meaning Homer) persuade you that the Gods assume the form of strangers, and are visible in such appearances. It must be confess'd, that if Plato had thus spoken only to refute the absurd opinions of Antiquity, which imagin'd the Gods to assume unworthy shapes of bulls, dragons, swans, &amp;c. only to perform some rape, or action unbecoming a Deity, reason would be on his side: But the argument proves too much; supposes that a Deity must lose his perfections by any appearance, but of a Deity; which is an error: If a God acts suitably to the character of a God, where is the degradation? Aristotle was of this judgment, in opposition to his master Plato; and thought it no diminution to a God to appear in the shape of man, the glory of the Creation: In reality, it is a great honour to Homer, that his opinions agree with the verity of the Scriptures, rather than the conjectures of Philosophers; nay, it is not impossible but these relations might be borrow'd from the sacred History: it being manifest that Homer had been in Ægypt, the native country of Moses, in whose writings there are frequent instances of this nature. in soft beauty's bloom, Skill'd in th' illustrious labours of the loom. Alone to Ithacus she stood display'd, But unapparent as a viewless shade Escap'd Telemachus: (the pow'rs above Seen or unseen, o'er earth at pleasure move) The dogs intelligent confess'd the tread This may seem a circumstance unworthy of Poetry, and ridiculous to ascribe a greater sagacity to the brute creation, than to man; but it may be answer'd, that it was the design of the Goddess to be invisible only to Telemachus, and consequently she was visible to the dogs. But I am willing to believe that there is a deeper meaning, and a beautiful moral couch'd under this story: And perhaps Homer speaks thus, to give us to understand, that the brute creation it self confesses the divinity. Dacier. Of pow'r divine, and howling, trembling fled. The Goddess beck'ning waves her deathless hands; The Goddess evidently acts thus, that Telemachus might not hear her speak to Ulysses; for this would have made the discovery, and precluded that beautiful interview between Ulysses and Telemachus that immediately follows. It is for the same reason that she conceals herself from Telemachus, for the discovery must have been fully and convincingly made by the appearance and veracity of a Deity; and then there could have been no room for all those doubts and fears of Telemachus, that enliven and beautify the manner of the discovery. The whole relation is indeed an allegory; The wisdom of Ulysses (in Poetry, Minerva) suggests to him, that this is a proper time to reveal himself to Telemachus; the same wisdom (or Minerva) instructs him to dress himself like a King, that he may find the readier credit with his son: In this dress he appears a new man, young and beautiful, which gives occasion to Telemachus to imagine him a Deity; especially because he was an infant when his father sail'd to Troy, and therefore though he now appears like Ulysses, Telemachus does not know him to be his father. This is the naked story, when stript of its poetical ornaments. Dauntless the King before the Goddess stands. Then why (she said) O favour'd of the skies! Why to thy god-like son this long disguise? Stand forth reveal'd: with him thy cares employ Against thy foes; be valiant, and destroy! Lo I descend in that avenging hour, To combat by thy side, thy guardian pow'r. She said, and o'er him waves her wand of gold; Imperial robes his manly limbs infold: At once with grace divine his frame improves; At once with majesty enlarg'd he moves: Youth flush'd his red'ning cheek, and from his brows A length of hair in sable ringlets flows; His black'ning chin receives a deeper shade: Then from his eyes upsprung the warrior-maid. The Heroe reascends: The Prince o'eraw'd Scarce lifts his eyes, and bows as to a God. I must offer a remark in opposition to that of Dacier upon this place: “This fear of Telemachus (says that Author) proceeds from the opinion of the Antients when the Gods came down visibly; they thought themselves so unworthy of such a manifestation, that whenever it happen'd, they believ'd they should die, or meet with some great calamity”: Thus the Israelites address Moses; Speak thou to us, and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die. Thus also Gideon; Alas! O Lord, my God, because I have seen an Angel of the Lord face to face, and the Lord said to him, fear not, thou shalt not die. Hence it is very evident, that this notion prevail'd amongst the Israelites: But how does it appear that the Greeks held the same opinion? The contrary is manifest almost to a demonstration: the Gods are introduc'd almost in every book both of the Iliad and Odyssey; and yet there is not the least foundation for such an assertion: nay, Telemachus himself in the second book returns thanks to Minerva for appearing to him, and prays for a second vision. O Goddess! who descending from the skies, Vouchsaf'd thy presence to my longing eyes; Hear from thy heav'ns above, O warrior Maid, Descend once more propitious to my aid! It is not to be imagined that Telemachus would have preferr'd this prayer, if the presence of the Deity denoted death, or some great calamity; and all the Heroes throughout the Iliad esteem such intercourses as their glory, and converse with the Gods without any apprehensions. But whence then proceeds this fear of Telemachus? entirely from a reverential awe and his own modesty while he stands in the presence of a Deity; for such he believes Ulysses. The words of Telemachus agree with his behaviour; he speaks the language of a man in surprize: It is this surprize at the sudden change of Ulysses, that first makes him imagine him a Deity, and upon that imagination offer him sacrifice and prayer; the whole behaviour paints the nature of man under surprize, and which transports the speaker into vehemence and emotion, Then with surprize (surprize chastis'd by fears) How art thou chang'd! (he cry'd) a God appears! Far other vests thy limbs majestic grace, Far other glories lighten from thy face! If heav'n be thy abode, with pious care Lo! I the ready sacrifice prepare: Lo! gifts of labour'd gold adorn thy shrine, To win thy grace: O save us pow'r divine! Few are my days, Ulysses made reply, Nor I, alas! descendent of the sky. I am thy father. O my son! my son! That father, for whose sake thy days have run One scene of woe; to endless cares consign'd, And outrag'd by the wrongs of base mankind. Then rushing to his arms, he kiss'd his boy With the strong raptures of a parent's joy. Tears bathe his cheek, and tears the ground bedew: He strain'd him close, as to his breast he grew. Ah me! (exclaims the Prince with fond desire) Thou art not—no, thou can'st not be my sire. Heav'n such illusion only can impose, By the false joy to aggravate my woes. Who but a God can change the general doom, And give to wither'd age a youthful bloom? Late worn with years in weeds obscene you trod, Now cloath'd in majesty, you move a God! Forbear, he cry'd; for heav'n reserve that name, Give to thy father but a father's claim: Other Ulysses shalt thou never see, I am Ulysses, I (my son) am He. Twice ten sad years o'er earth and ocean tost, 'Tis giv'n at length to view my native coast. Pallas, unconquer'd maid, my frame surrounds With grace divine; her pow'r admits no bounds: She o'er my limbs old age and wrinkles shed; Now strong as youth, magnificent I tread. The Gods with ease frail man depress, or raise, Exalt the lowly, or the proud debase. He spoke and sate. The Prince with transport flew, Hung round his neck, while tears his cheek bedew; Nor less the father pour'd a social flood; They wept abundant, and they wept aloud. As the bold eagle This is a beautiful comparison; but to take its full force, it is necessary to observe the nature of this ???? or vultur: Homer does not compare Ulysses to that bird merely for its dignity, it being of the Aquiline kind, and therefore the King of birds; but from the knowledge of the nature of it, which doubles the beauty of the allusion: This bird is remarkable for the love it bears towards its young: Tearing open her own thigh, she feeds her young with her own blood: Thus also another Author; ??? ????? ???????????, ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ?? ?????. Femore exsecto, sanguineo lactis defluxu, suos fœtus refocillant. And the Egyptians made the vultur their hieroglyphic, to represent a compassionate nature. This gives a reason why this bird is introduc'd with peculiar propriety to represent the fondness of Ulysses for Telemachus. But where is the point of the similitude? Ulysses embraces his son, but the vultur is said to mourn the loss of her young: Eustathius answers, that the sorrow alone, and vehemence of it, is intended to be illustrated by the comparison; I think he should have added the affection Ulysses bears to Telemachus. It is observable, that Homer inserts very few similitudes in his Odyssey, tho' they occur frequently almost in every book of the Iliad. The Odyssey is wrote with more simplicity, and consequently there is less room for allusions. If we observe the similies themselves inserted in each Poem, we shall find the same difference: In the Iliad they are drawn from lions, storms, torrents, conflagrations; thunder, &amp;c. In the Odyssey, from lower objects, from an heap of thorns, from a shipwright plying the wimble, an armourer tempering iron, a matron weeping over her dying husband, &amp;c. The Similies are likewise generally longer in the Iliad than the Odyssey, and less resemblance between the thing illustrated, and the illustration; the reason is, in the Iliad the similitudes are introduced to illustrate some great and noble object, and therefore the Poet proceeds till he has rais'd some noble image to inflame the mind of the Reader; whereas in these calmer scenes the Poet keeps closer to the point of allusion, and needs only to represent the object, to render it entertaining: By the former conduct he raises our admiration above the subject, by adding foreign embellishments; in the latter he brings the copy as close as possible to the original, to possess us with a true and equal image of it. It has been objected by a French Critic, that Homer is blameable for too great a length in his similitudes; that in the heat of an action he stops short, and turns to some illusion, which calls off our attention from the main subject. 'Tis true, comparisons ought not to be too long, and are not to be plac'd in the heat of an action, as Mr. Dryden observes, but when it begins to decline: Thus in the first Æneis, when the storm is in its fury, the Poet introduces no comparison, because nothing can be more impetuous than the storm it self; but when the heat of the description abates, then lest we should cool too soon, he renews it by some proper similitude, which still keeps up our attention and fixes the whole upon our minds. The similitude before us is thus placed at the conclusion of the Heroe's lamentation, and the Poet by this method leaves the whole deeply fix'd upon the memory. Virgil has imitated this comparison in his fourth Georgic, but very judiciously substituted the nightingale in the place of the vultur, that bird being introduc'd to represent the mournful music of Orpheus. Qualis populeâ mærens Philomela sub umbrâ Amissos queritur fœtus quos durus arator Observans nido implumes detraxit; at illa Flet noctem, &amp;c. Nothing can be sweeter than this comparison of Virgil, but the learned Huetius thinks he has found a notorious blunder in it: This nightingale (says he) in the first line sits in the shade of a poplar, and yet in the fourth she mourns by night, flet noctem. It is evident that Monsieur Huet mistakes the word umbra for the shade of the tree, which it casts while the sun shines upon it; whereas it only means that the bird sings sub foliis, or conceal'd in the leaves of it, which may be done by night as well as by day: But if it be thought that this is not a sufficient answer, the passage may be thus understood: The nightingale mourning under the shade of a poplar, &amp;c. ceases not all night, or flet noctem; that is, she begins her song in the evening by day, but mourns all night. Either of these answers are sufficient for Virgil's vindication. with fierce sorrow stung, Or parent vultur, mourns her ravish'd young; They cry, they scream, their unfledg'd brood a prey To some rude churl, and born by stealth away, So they aloud: and tears in tides had run, Their grief unfinish'd with the setting sun: But checking the full torrent in its flow, The Prince thus interrupts the solemn woe. It does not appear at first view why the Poet makes Telemachus recover himself from his transport of sorrow sooner than Ulysses: Is Telemachus a greater master of his passions? or is it to convince Ulysses of his son's wisdom, as Eustathius conjectures? this can scarce be suppos'd, Ulysses being superior in wisdom. I would chuse rather to ascribe it to human nature; for it has been observ'd, that affection seldom so strongly ascends, as it descends; the child seldom loves the father so tenderly, as the father the child: This observation has been made from the remotest Antiquity. And it is wisely design'd by the great Author of our Natures; for in the common course of life, the child must bury the parent; it is therefore a merciful dispensation, that the tye of blood and affection should be loosen'd by degrees, and not torn violently asunder in the full strength of it. It is expected that aged persons should die, their loss therefore grows more familiar to us, and it loses much of its horror through the long expectation of it. What ship transported thee, O father say, And what blest hands have oar'd thee on the way? All, all (Ulysses instant made reply) I tell thee all, my child, my only joy! Phæacians bore me to the port assign'd, Here is a repetition of what the Reader knows entirely, from many parts of the preceding story; but it being necessary in this place, the Poet judiciously reduces it into the compass of six lines, and by this method avoids prolixity. Eustathius. A nation ever to the stranger kind; Wrapt in th'embrace of sleep, the faithful train O'er seas convey'd me to my native reign: Embroider'd vestures, gold, and brass are laid Conceal'd in caverns in the sylvan shade. Hither, intent the rival rout to slay And plan the scene of death, I bend my way: So Pallas wills—but thou, my son, explain The names, and numbers of th' audacious train; 'Tis mine to judge if better to employ Assistant force, or singly to destroy. O'er earth (returns the Prince) resounds thy name, Thy well-try'd wisdom, and thy martial fame, Yet at thy words I start, in wonder lost; Can we engage, not decads, but an host? Can we alone in furious battle stand, Against that num'rous, and determin'd band? Hear then their numbers: According to this catalogue, the Suitors with their attendants (the two sewers, and Medon, and Phemius) are a hundred and eighteen; but the two last are not to be taken for the enemies of Ulysses; and therefore are not involv'd in their punishment in the conclusion of the Odyssey. Eustathius. Spondanus mistakes this passage egregiously. ????? ????? ??? ????? ??????. He understands it thus, “Medon who was an Herald and a divine bard.” Præco unus qui &amp; idem Musicus: 'Tis true, the construction will bear this interpretation; but it is evident from the latter part of the 22d Odyssey, that the ????? and the ?????? were two persons, namely, Medon and Phemius: Medon acts all along as a friend to Penelope and Telemachus, and Phemius is affirm'd to be detain'd by the Suitors involuntarily, and consequently they are both guiltless. From Dulichium came Twice twenty six, all peers of mighty name, Six are their menial train: twice twelve the boast Of Samos; twenty from Zacynthus coast: And twelve our country's pride; to these belong Medon and Phemius skill'd in heav'nly song. Two sew'rs from day to day the revels wait, Exact of taste, and serve the feast in state. With such a foe th' unequal fight to try, Were by false courage unreveng'd to die. Then what assistant pow'rs you boast, relate, Ere yet we mingle in the stern debate. Mark well my voice, Ulysses strait replies: What need of aids, if favour'd by the skies? If shielded to the dreadful fight we move, By mighty Pallas, and by thund'ring Jove. Sufficient they (Telemachus rejoin'd) Against the banded pow'rs of all mankind: They, high enthron'd above the rolling clouds, Wither the strength of man, and awe the Gods. Such aids expect, he cries, when strong in might This whole discourse between Ulysses and Telemachus is introduc'd to prepare the Reader for the Catastrophe of the Poem: Homer judiciously interests Heaven in the cause, that the Reader may not be surpriz'd at the event, when he sees such numbers fall by the hands of these Heroes; he consults probability, and as the Poem now draws to a conclusion, sets the assistance of Heaven full before the Reader. It is likewise very artful to let us into some knowledge of the event of the Poem; all care must be taken that it be rather guess'd than known. If it be entirely known, the Reader finds nothing new to awaken his attention; if on the contrary it be so intricate, that the event cannot possibly be guess'd at, we wander in the dark, and are lost in uncertainty. The art of the Poet consists not in concealing the event entirely; but when it is in some measure foreseen, in introducing such a number of incidents that now bring us almost into the sight of it, then by new obstacles perplex the story to the very conclusion of the Poem; every obstacle, and every removal of it fills us with surprize, with pleasure or pain alternately, and consequently calls up our whole attention. This is admirably describ'd by Vida, lib. 2. ? Eventus nonnullis sæpe canendo Indiciis porrò ostendunt in luce malignâ Sublustrique aliquid dant cernere noctis in umbrâ. Th' event should glimmer with a dubious ray, Not hid in clouds, nor glare in open day. This rule he afterwards illustrates by a very happy similitude, Haud aliter longinqua petit qui forte viator Mœnia, si positas altis in collibus arces Nunc etiam dubias oculis videt, incipit ultro Lætior ire viam, placidumque urgere laborem, Quàm cùm nusquam ullæ cernuntur quas adit arces, Obscurum sed iter tendit convallibus imis. The conduct both of Virgil and Homer are agreeable to this observation; for instance, Anchises and Tiresias in the shades, foretel Æneas and Ulysses that all their troubles shall end prosperously, that the one shall found the Roman Empire, the other regain his kingdoms; but the means being kept conceal'd, our appetite is rather whetted than cloy'd, to know by what means these events are brought about: Thus, as in Vida's allusion, they shew us the City at a great distance, but how we are to arrive at it, by what roads they intend to guide us to it, this they keep conceal'd; the journey discovers itself, and every step we advance leads us forward, and shews where we are to take the next; neither does the Poet directly lead us in the strait path, sometimes we are as it were in a labyrinth, and we know not how to extricate our selves out of it; sometimes he carries us into by-ways, and we almost lose sight of the direct way, and then suddenly they open into the chief road, and convey us to the journey's end. In this consists the skill of the Poet; he must form probable intricacies, and then solve them probably; he must set his Heroe in dangers, and then bring him out of them with honour. This observation is necessary to be apply'd to all those passages in the Odyssey, where the event of it is obscurely foretold, and which some tasteless Critics have blam'd, as taking away the curiosity of the Reader by an unseasonable discovery. We rise terrific to the task of fight. But thou, when morn salutes th' aerial plain, The court revisit and the lawless train: Me thither in disguise Eumæus leads, An aged mendicant in tatter'd weeds. There, if base scorn insult my rev'rend age, Bear it my son! repress thy rising rage: If outrag'd, cease that outrage to repel, Plutarch in his Treatise upon reading Poems, observes the wisdom of Ulysses in these instructions: He is the person who is more immediately injur'd, yet he not only restrains his own resentment, but that of Telemachus: He perceives that his son is in danger of flying out into some passion, he therefore very wisely arms him against it. Men do not put bridles upon horses when they are already running with full speed, but they bridle them before they bring them out to the race: This very well illustrates the conduct of Ulysses; he fears the youth of Telemachus may be too warm, and through an unseasonable ardour at the sight of his wrongs, betray him to his enemies; he therefore persuades him to patience and calmness, and pre-disposes his mind with rational considerations to enable him to encounter his passions, and govern his resentment. Bear it my son! howe'er thy heart rebel. Yet strive by pray'r and counsel to restrain Their lawless insults, tho' thou strive in vain: For wicked ears are deaf to wisdom's call, And vengeance strikes whom heav'n has doom'd to fall. Once more attend: When Minerva. she whose pow'r inspires The thinking mind, my soul to vengeance fires; I give the sign: that instant, from beneath, These ten lines occur in the beginning of the nineteenth book, and the antients (as Eustathius informs us) were of opinion, that they are here plac'd improperly; for how, say they, should Ulysses know that the arms were in a lower apartment, when he was in the country, and had not yet seen his Palace? But this is no real objection; his repository of arms he knew was in the lower apartment, and therefore it was rational to conclude that the arms were in it. The verses are proper in both places; here Ulysses prepares Telemachus against the time of the execution of his designs; in the nineteenth book that time is come, and therefore he repeats his instructions. Aloft convey the instruments of death, Armour and arms; and if mistrust arise, Thus veil the truth in plausible disguise. “These glittering weapons, ere he sail'd to Troy “Ulysses view'd with stern heroic joy; “Then, beaming o'er th' illumin'd wall they shone: “Now dust dishonours all their lustre gone. “I bear them hence (so Jove my soul inspires) “From the pollution of the fuming fires; “Lest when the bowl inflames, in vengeful mood “Ye rush to arms, and stain the feast with blood; “Oft ready swords in luckless hour incite This seems to have been a proverbial expression, at least it has been so used by latter writers: The observation holds true to this day, and it is manifest that more men fall by the sword in countries where the inhabitants daily wear swords, than in those where a sword is thought no part of dress or ornament. Dacier. “The hand of wrath, and arm it for the fight. Such be the plea, and by the plea deceive: For Jove infatuates all, and all believe. Yet leave for each of us a sword to wield, A pointed javelin, and a fenceful shield. But by my blood that in thy bosom glows, By that regard a son his father owes; The secret that thy father lives, retain This injunction of secrecy is introduc'd by Ulysses with the utmost solemnity; and it was very necessary that it should be so; the whole hopes of his re-establishment depending upon it: Besides, this behaviour agrees with the character of Ulysses, which is remarkable for disguise and concealment. The Poet makes a further use of it; namely, to give him an opportunity to describe at large the several discoveries made to Penelope. Laertes, and Eumæus personally by Ulysses, in the sequel of the Odyssey, which are no small ornaments to it; yet must have been omitted, or have lost their effect, if the return of Ulysses had been made known by Telemachus; this would have been like discovering the plot before the beginning of the play. At the same time this direction is an excellent rule to be observ'd in management of all weighty affairs, the success of which chiefly depends upon secrecy. Lock'd in thy bosom from the houshold train; Hide it from all; ev'n from Eumæus hide, From my dear father, and my dearer bride. One care remains, to note the loyal few Whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew; And noting, ere we rise in vengeance prove Who loves his Prince; for sure you merit love. To whom the youth: To emulate I aim The brave and wise, and my great father's fame. But re-consider, since the wisest err, The Poet here describes Telemachus rectifying the judgment of Ulysses; Is this any disparagement to that Heroe? It is not, but an exact representation of human nature; for the wisest man may receive, in particular cases, instructions from men less wise; and the eye of the understanding in a young man, may sometimes see further than that of age; that is, in the language of the Poet, a wise and mature Ulysses may sometimes be instructed by a young and unexperienc'd Telemachus. Vengeance resolv'd 'tis, dang'rous to defer. What length of time must we consume in vain, Too curious to explore the menial train? While the proud foes, industrious to destroy Thy wealth in riot, the delay enjoy. Suffice it in this exigence alone To mark the damsels that attend the throne: Dispers'd the youth resides; their faith to prove Jove grants henceforth, if thou hast spoke from Jove. The expression in the Greek is obscure, and it may be ask'd, to what refers ???? ?????? Dacier renders it, S'il vray que vous ayez vû un Prodige; or “if it be true that you have seen a prodigy:” Now there is no mention of any prodigy seen by Ulysses in all this interview, and this occasions the obscurity: but it is imply'd, for Ulysses directly promises the assistance of Jupiter; and how could he depend upon it, but by some prodigy from Jupiter? Eustathius thus understands the words; ?????, ?? ?? ????????? ???? ???????? ??? ??? ???? ??????. And then the meaning will be, “If the prodigy from Jupiter be evident, there is no occasion to concern our selves about the houshold train.” But then does not that expression imply doubt, and a jealosy, that Ulysses might possibly depend too much upon supernatural assistance? It only insinuates, that he ought to be certain in the interpretation of the prodigy, but Telemachus refers himself entirely to Ulysses, and acquiesces in his judgment. While in debate they waste the hours away, Th' associates of the Prince repass'd the bay; It is manifest that this vessel had spent the evening of the preceding day, the whole night and part of the next morning, in sailing from the place where Telemachus embark'd: For it is necessary to remember that Telemachus to avoid the Suitors had been obliged to fetch a large compass, and land upon the northern coast of Ithaca; and consequently the vessel was necessitated to double the whole Isle on the western side to reach the Ithacan bay. This is the reason that it arrives not till the day afterwards, and that the Herald dispatched by the associates of Telemachus, and Eumæus from the country, meet upon the road, as they go to carry the news of the return of Telemachus to Penelope. It is likewise evident that the lodge of Eumæus was not far distant from the place; for he sets out toward the City after eating in the morning, and passing some time in conference with Telemachus, delivers his message, and returns in the evening of the same day. With speed they guide the vessel to the shores; With speed debarking land the naval stores; Then faithful to their charge, to Clytius bear, And trust the presents to his friendly care. Swift to the Queen a herald flies t'impart Her son's return, and ease a parent's heart; Lest a sad prey to ever-musing cares, Pale grief destroy what time a while forbears. Th' uncautious Herald with impatience burns, And cries aloud, Thy son, oh Queen returns: This little circumstance distinguishes characters, and gives variety to Poetry: It is a kind of painting, which always varies its figures by some particular ornament, or attitude, so as no two figures are alike: The contrary conduct would make an equal confusion both in Poetry and Painting, and an indistinction of persons and characters. I will not promise that these particularities are of equal beauty, as necessity, especially in modern languagues; the Greek is always flowing, sonorous and harmonious; the language, like leaves, oftentimes conceals barrenness, and a want of fruit, and renders the sense at least beautiful, if not profitable; this is wanted in some degree in English Poetry, where it is not always in our power to conceal the nakedness with ornaments: This particularity before us is of absolute necessity, and could not well be avoided; the indiscretion of the Herald in speaking aloud, discovers the return of Telemachus to the Suitors, and is the incident that brings about their following debates, and furnishes out the entertainment of the succeeding part of this book. Eumæus sage approach'd th' imperial throne, And breath'd his mandate to her ear alone, Then measur'd back the way—The suitor band Stung to the soul, abash'd, confounded stand; And issuing from the dome, before the gate, With clouded looks, a pale assembly fate. At length Eurymachus. Our hopes are vain; Telemachus in triumph sails the main. Haste, rear the mast, the swelling shroud display; Haste, to our ambush'd friends the news convey! Scarce had he spoke, when turning to the strand Amphinomus survey'd th' associate band; Full to the bay within the winding shores With gather'd sails they stood, and lifted oars. O friends! he cry'd, elate with rising joy. See to the port secure the vessel fly! Some God has told them, or themselves survey The bark escap'd; and measure back their way. Swift at the word descending to the shores, They moor the vessel and unlade the stores: Then moving from the strand, apart they sate, And full and frequent, form'd a dire debate. Lives then the boy? he lives, (Antinous cries) The care of Gods and fav'rite of the skies. All night we watch'd, till with her orient wheels Aurora flam'd above the eastern hills, And from the lofty brow of rocks by day Took in the ocean with a broad survey: Yet safe he sails! the pow'rs cœlestial give To shun the hidden snares of death, and live. But die he shall, and thus condemn'd to bleed Be now the scene of instant death decreed: Hope ye success? undaunted crush the foe. Is he not wise? know this, and strike the blow. Wait ye, till he to arms in council draws The Greeks, averse too justly to our cause? This verse is inserted with great judgment, and gives an air of probability to the whole relation; for if it be ask'd why the Suitors defer to seize the supreme power, and to murder Telemachus, they being so superior in number? Antinous himself answers, that they fear the people, who favour the cause of Telemachus, and would revenge his injuries: 'Tis for this reason that they form'd the ambush by sea; and for this reason Antinous proposes to intercept him in his return from the country: they dare not offer open violence, and therefore make use of treachery. This speech of Antinous forms a short under-plot to the Poem; it gives us pain (says Eustathius) for Telemachus, and holds us in suspense till the intimacy is unravell'd by Amphinomus. The whole harangue is admirable in Homer: the diction is excellently suited to the temper of Antinous, who speaks with precipitation: His mind is in agitation and disorder, and consequently his language is abrupt, and not allowing himself time to explain his thoughts at full length, he falls into ellipses and abbreviations. For instance, he is to speak against Telemachus, but his contempt and resentment will not permit him to mention his name, he therefore calls him ??? ?????; thus in ????? ????? ?????? ??????? is understood; thus likewise in this verse, ???? ????? ???? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ? the word ????????????, or ????????, must be understood, to make the sense intelligible. Thus also after ?? ?? ???? ??? ?????, ?????????, to make ???? in the next sentence begin it significantly, we must supply ??? ?? ????? ????? ? ?????; then the sense is compleat; If this opinion displease, and his death appear not honourable, but you would have him live, &amp;c. otherwise ???? ????????? must be constru'd like ???????? ??; and lastly, to image the disorder of Antinous more strongly, Homer inserts a false quantity, by making the first syllable in ???????? short. Antinous attends not, thro' the violence of his spirit, to the words he utters, and therefore falls into this error, which excellenty represents it. It is impossible to retain these Ellipses in the translation, but I have endeavour'd to shew the warmth of the speaker, by putting the words into Interrogations, which are always utter'd with vehemence, and signs of hurry and precipitation. Strike, ere the States conven'd the foe betray, Our murd'rous ambush on the wat'ry way. Or chuse ye vagrant from their rage to fly Outcasts of earth, to breathe an unknown sky? The brave prevent misfortune; then be brave, And bury future danger in his grave. Returns he? ambush'd we'll his walk invade, Or where he hides in solitude and shade: And give the Palace to the Queen a dow'r, Or him she blesses in the bridal hour. But if submissive you resign the sway, Slaves to a boy, go, flatter and obey. Retire we instant to our native reign, Nor be the wealth of Kings consum'd in vain. Then wed whom choice approves: the Queen be giv'n To some blest Prince, the Prince decreed by Heav'n. Abash'd, the suitor train his voice attends; 'Till from his throne Amphinomus ascends. Who o'er Dulichium stretch'd his spacious reign, A land of plenty, blest with every grain: Chief of the numbers who the Queen addrest, And tho' displeasing, yet displeasing least. We are not to gather from this expression, that Penelope had any particular tenderness for Amphinomus, but it means only that he was a person of some justice and moderation. At first view, there seems no reason why the Poet should distinguish Amphinomus from the rest of the Suitors, by giving him this humane character; but in reality there is an absolute necessity for it. Telemachus is doom'd to die by Antinous: here is an intricacy form'd, and how is that Heroe to be preserv'd with probability? The Poet ascribes a greater degree of tenderness and moderation to one of the Suitors, and by this method preserves Telemachus. Thus we see the least circumstance in Homer has its use and effect; the art of a good Painter is visible in the smallest sketch, as well as in the largest draught. Soft were his words; his actions wisdom sway'd; Graceful a-while he paus'd, then mildly said. O friends forbear! and be the thought withstood: 'Tis horrible to shed imperial blood! Consult we first th'all-seeing pow'rs above, And the sure oracles of righteous Jove. Strabo, lib. 7. quotes this verse of Homer, and tells us that some Critics thus reads it. ?? ??? ?? ???????? ???? ???????? ????????. preferring ???????? to ????????; for, add they, ???????? no where in Homer signifies Oracles, but constantly laws or councils. Tmarus or Tomarus was a mountain on which the oracle of Jupiter stood, and in process of time it was used to denote the Oracles themselves. ???????? is form'd like the word ????????, the former signifies custos Tmari, the latter custos domûs: in this sense, Amphinomus advises to consult the Dodonæan oracles, which were given from the mountain Tmarus: But, adds Strabo, Homer is to be understood more plainly; and by ????????, the councils, the will and decisions of the oracles are imply'd, for those decisions were held as laws; thus ?????, as wells as ????????, signifies the Dodonæan Oracles. ?? ????? ????????? ???? ?????? ?????????. Neither is it true (observes the Scholiast upon Strabo) that ???????? never signifies Oracles in Homer: for in the Hymn to Apollo (and Thucydides quotes that hymn as Homer's) the poet thus uses it, ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ? Strabo himself uses ?????????? in this sense, lib. 17. and in the oracles that yet are extant, ??????????? frequently signifies oracula reddere: and in Ælian (continues the Scholiast) lib. 3. chap. 43, 44. ?? ?? ??????????, signifies non tibi oracula reddam; and Hesychius renders ???????? by ???????, ???????, Prophecy or Oracles. If they assent, ev'n by this hand he dies; If they forbid, I war not with the skies. He said: The rival train his voice approv'd, And rising instant to the Palace mov'd. Arriv'd, with wild tumultuous noise they sate Recumbent on the shining thrones of state. The Medon, conscious of their dire debates, After this Verse Eustathius recites one that is omitted in most of the late editions as spurious, at least improper. ????? ????? ???, ?? ?? ?????? ????? ???????. That is, Medon was out of the court, whereas the Suitors form'd their council within it: The line is really to be suspected; for a little above, Homer directly tells us, that the Suitors left the Palace. Then issuing from the dome, before the gate With clouded looks, a pale assembly sate. It is likewise very evident that they stood in the open air, for they discover the ship returning from the ambush, and sailing into the bay. How then can it be said of the Suitors, that they form'd their assembly in the court, ?? ?? ????? ????? ???????.. Besides, continues Dacier, they left the palace, and placed themselves under the lofty wall of it. ?? ?? ????? ????????, ????? ???? ??????? ?????. How then is it possible to see the ship entring the port, when this wall must necessarily obstruct the sight? The two verses therefore evidently contradict themselves, and one of them must consequently be rejected: she would have the line read thus; ????? ????? ???, ?? ?? ??????, &amp;c. But all the difficulty vanishes by taking ????, as it is frequently used, to denote any place open to the air, and consequently not the court, but the court-yard, and this is the proper signification of the word. Then Medon may stand on the outside of the wall of the court-yard, ????? ?????, and over-hear the debates of the Suitors who form their council within it, or ????? ????? ???????. And as for the wall intercepting the view of the Suitors, this is merely conjecture; and 'tis more rational to imagine that the court-yard was open seaward, that so beautiful a prospect as the ocean might not be shut up from the palace of a King; or at least, the palace might stand upon such an eminence as to command the ocean. The murd'rous council to the Queen relates. Touch'd at the dreadful story she descends; Her hasty steps a damsel train attends. Full where the dome its shining valves expands, Sudden before the rival pow'rs she stands: And veiling decent with a modest shade Her cheek, indignant to Antinous said. O void of faith! of all bad men the worst! Renown'd for wisdom, by th' abuse accurst! Mistaking fame proclaims thy generous mind! Thy deeds denote thee of the basest kind. Wretch! to destroy a Prince that friendship gives, While in his guest his murd'rer he receives: Nor dread superior Jove, to whom belong The cause of suppliants, and revenge of wrong. Hast thou forgot, (ingrateful as thou art) Who sav'd thy father with a friendly part? Lawless he ravag'd with his martial pow'rs The Taphian pyrates on Thesprotia's shores; Enrag'd, his life, his treasures they demand; Ulysses sav'd him from th' avenger's hand. This whole passage is thus understood by Eustathius; By ?????? ?????????? Homer means the Ithacans; and he likewise affirms that the people who demanded vengeance of Ulysses were also the Ithacans. It is not here translated in this sense, the construction rather requires it to be understood of the Thesprotians, who were allies of Ulysses, and by vertue of that alliance demanded Eupithes, the Father of Antinous, out of the hands of Ulysses. But I submit to the Reader's judgment. And would thou evil for his good repay? His bed dishonour, and his house betray? Afflict his Queen? and with a murd'rous hand 'Tis observable that Penelope in the compass of two lines recites four heads of her complaint; such contractions of thought and expression being natural to persons in anger, as Eustathius observes; she speaks with heat, and consequently starts from thought to thought with precipitation. The whole speech is animated with a generous resentment, and she concludes at once like a Mother and a Queen; like a Mother, with affection for Telemachus; and like a Queen with authority, ???????? ???????. Destroy his?—but cease, 'tis I command. Far hence those fears, (Eurymachus reply'd) This whole discourse of Eurymachus is to be understood by the way of contrariety: There is an obvious and a latent Interpretation; for instance, when he says, His blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear; it obviously means the blood of the person who offers violence to Telemachus; but it may likewise mean the blood of Telemachus, and the construction admits both interpretations: Thus also when he says, that no person shall lay hands upon Telemachus, while he is alive, he means that he will do it himself: and lastly, when he adds, Then fear no mortal arm: if heav'n destroy, We must resign; for Man is born to die. the apparent signification is, that Telemachus has occasion only to fear a natural death; but he means if the oracle of Jupiter commands them to destroy Telemachus, that then the Suitors will take away his life. He alludes to the foregoing speech of Amphinomus: Consult we first th' all-seeing pow'rs above, And the sure oracles of righteous Jove. If they assent, ev'n by this hand he dies; If they forbid, I war not with the skies. Eustathius. O prudent Princess! bid thy soul confide. Breathes there a man who dares that Heroe slay, While I behold the golden light of day? No: by the righteous pow'rs of heav'n I swear, His blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear. Ulysses, when my infant days I led, With wine suffic'd me, and with dainties fed: My gen'rous soul abhors th' ungrateful part, And my friend's son lives dearest to my heart. Then fear no mortal arm: If heav'n destroy, We must resign; for man is born to die. Thus smooth he ended, yet his death conspir'd: Then sorrowing, with sad step the Queen retir'd, With streaming eyes all comfortless deplor'd, Touch'd with the dear remembrance of her Lord; Nor ceas'd, till Pallas bid her sorrows fly, And in soft slumber seal'd her flowing eye. And now Eumæus, at the ev'ning hour, Came late-returning to his sylvan bow'r. Ulysses and his son had drest with art A yearling boar, and gave the Gods their part, Holy repast! That instant from the skies The martial Goddess to Ulysses flies: She waves her golden wand, and reassumes From ev'ry feature every grace that blooms; At once his vestures change; at once she sheds Age o'er his limbs, that tremble as he treads. Lest to the Queen the swain with transport fly, Unable to contain th'unruly joy. When near he drew, the Prince breaks forth; proclaim What tydings, friend? what speaks the voice of fame? Say, if the Suitors measure back the main, Or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain? Whether, he cries, they measure back the flood, Or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood, Escap'd my care: where lawless Suitors sway, Thy mandate born, my soul disdain'd to stay. But from th'Hermæan height It would be superfluous to translate all the various interpretations of this passage; it will be sufficiently intelligible to the Reader, if he looks upon it only to imply that there was an hill in Ithaca called the Hermæan hill, either because there was a Temple, Statue, or Altar of Mercury upon it; and so called from that Deity. It has been written that Mercury being the Messenger of the Gods, in his frequent journeys clear'd the roads, and when he found any stones, he threw them in an heap out of the way, and these heaps were called ???????, or Mercuries. The circumstance of his clearing the roads is somewhat odd, but why might not Mercury as well as Trivia preside over them, and have his images erected in publick ways, because he was supposed to frequent them as the messenger of the Gods? This book takes up no more time than the space of the thirty eighth day; for Telemachus reaches the lodge of Eumæus in the morning, a little after he dispatches Eumæus to Penelope, who returns in the evening of the same day. The book in general is very beautiful in the original; the discovery of Ulysses to Telemachus is particularly tender and affecting: It has some resemblance with that of Joseph's discovery of himself to his brethren, and it may not perhaps be disagreeable to see how two such Authors describe the same passion. I am Joseph, I am your brother Joseph. I am Ulysses, I, my Son! am he! and he wept aloud, and he fell on his brother's neck and wept. He wept abundant, and he wept aloud. But it must be own'd that Homer falls infinitely short of Moses: He must be a very wicked man, that can read the History of Joseph without the utmost touches of compassion and transport. There is a majestick simplicity in the whole relation, and such an affecting portrait of human nature, that it overwhelms us with vicissitudes of joy and sorrow. This is a pregnant instance how much the best of heathen Writers is inferior to the divine Historian upon a parallel subject, where the two Authors endeavour to move the softer passions. The same may with equal truth be said in respect to Sublimity; not only in the instance produced by Longinus, viz. Let there be light, and there was light. Let the earth be made, and the earth was made: but in general, in the more elevated parts of Scripture, and particularly the whole book of Job; which, with regard both to sublimity of thought, and morality, exceeds beyond all comparison the most noble parts of Homer. I cast a view, Where to the port a bark high bounding flew; Her freight a shining band: with martial air Each pois'd his shield, and each advanc'd his spear; And if aright these searching eyes survey, Th' eluded Suitors stem the wat'ry way. The Prince well pleas'd to disappoint their wiles, Steals on his Sire a glance, and secret smiles. And now a short repast prepar'd, they fed, 'Till the keen rage of craving hunger fled: Then to repose withdrawn, apart they lay, And in soft sleep forgot the cares of day. THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. Telemachus returning to the City, relates to Penelope the sum of his travels. Ulysses is conducted by Eumæus to the Palace, where his old dog Argus acknowledges his Master, after an absence of twenty years, and dies with joy. Eumæus returns into the country, and Ulysses remains among the Suitors, whose behaviour is described. Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn; In haste the Prince arose, prepar'd to part; His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart; Fair on his feet the polish'd sandals shine, And thus he greets the master of the swine. My friend adieu; let this short stay suffice; I haste to meet my mother's longing eyes, There are two reasons for the return of Telemachus; one, the duty a son owes to a mother; the other, to find an opportunity to put in execution the designs concerted with Ulysses: the Poet therefore shifts the scene from the Lodge to the Palace. Telemachus takes not Ulysses along with him, for fear he should raise suspicion in the Suitors, that a person in a beggar's garb has some secret merit, to obtain the familiarity of a King's son, and this might be an occasion of a discovery; whereas when Ulysses afterwards appears amongst the Suitors, he is thought to be an entire stranger to Telemachus, which prevents all jealousy, and gives them an opportunity to carry on their measures without any particular observation. Besides, Eumæus is still to be kept in ignorance concerning the person of Ulysses? Telemachus therefore gives him a plausible reason for his return; namely, that his mother may no longer be in pain for his safety: This likewise excellently contributes to deceive Eumæus. Now as the presence of Ulysses in the Palace is absolutely necessary to bring about the Suitor's destruction, Telemachus orders Eumæus to conduct him thither, and by this method he comes as the friend and guest of Eumæus, not of Telemachus: Moreover, this injunction was necessary: Eumæus was a person of such generosity, that he would have thought himself obliged to detain his guest under his own care and inspection: nay, before he guides him towards the Palace, in the sequel of this book, he tells Ulysses he does it solely in compliance with the order of Telemachus, and acts contrary to his own inclinations. And end her tears, her sorrows, and her sighs. But thou attentive, what we order heed; This hapless stranger to the city lead; By publick bounty let him there be fed, And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread. To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes, This might appear too free a declaration, if Telemachus had made it before he knew Ulysses; for no circumstance could justify him for using any disregard toward the poor and stranger, according to the strict notions, and the sanctity, of the laws of hospitality amongst the antients: but as the case stands we are not the least shock'd at the words of Telemachus, we know the reason why he thus speaks: It is to conceal Ulysses. He is so far from shewing any particular regard to him, that he treats him with a severity in some degree contrary to the laws of hospitality; by adding, that if he complains of this hard usage, the complaint will not redress but encrease his calamity. My will may covet, but my pow'r denies. If this raise anger in the stranger's thought, The pain of anger punishes the fault: The very truth I undisguis'd declare: For what so easy as to be sincere? To this Ulysses. What the Prince requires Of swift removal, seconds my desires. To want like mine, the peopled town can yield More hopes of comfort than the lonely field. Nor fits my age to till the labour'd lands, Or stoop to tasks a rural Lord demands. Adieu! but since this ragged garb can bear So ill, th' inclemencies of morning air, A few hours space permit me here to stay; My steps Eumæus shall to town convey, With riper beams when Phœbus warms the day. Thus he: nor ought Telemachus reply'd, But left the mansion with a lofty stride: Schemes of revenge his pond'ring breast elate, Revolving deep the Suitors' sudden fate. Arriving now before th' Imperial hall, He props his spear against the pillar'd wall; Then like a Lion o'er the threshold bounds; The marble pavement with his step resounds: His eye first glanc'd where Euryclea spreads With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds: She saw, she wept, she ran with eager pace, And reach'd her master with a long embrace. All crowded round the family appears, With wild entrancement, and ecstatic tears. Swift from above descends the royal Fair; (Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air) This description presents us with a noble idea of the beauty and chastity of Penelope; her person resembles Venus, but Venus with the modest air of Diana. Dionysius Halicarn. takes notice of the beauty and softness of these two verses. ? ?? ??? ?? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ?????, ? ?? ????? ????????. When Homer (remarks that Author) paints a beautiful face, or an engaging object, he chuses the softest vowels, and most smooth and flowing semivowels: He never clogs the pronounciation with-rough sounds, and a collision of untunable consonants, but every syllable, every letter conspires to exhibit the beauty of the object he endeavours to represent: There are no less than three and thirty vowels in two lines, and no more than twenty nine consonants, which makes the verses flow away with an agreeable smoothness and harmony. Penelope, we see, embraces her son with the utmost affection: Kissing the lip was not in fashion in the days of Homer; No one (remarks the Bishop) ever kisses the lip or mouth. Penelope here kisses her son's eyes, and his head; that is, his cheek, or perhaps forehead: and Eumæus, in the preceding book, embraces the hands, eyes. and head of Telemachus. But for the comfort of the Ladies, I rejoice to observe that all these were ceremonious kisses from a mother to a son, or from an inferior to a superior: This therefore is no argument that lovers thus embrac'd, nor ought it to be brought as a reason why the present manner of salutation should be abrogated. Madam Dacier has been so tender as to keep it a secret from the men, that there ever was a time in which the modern method of kissing was not in fashion; she highly deserves their thanks and gratitude for it. Hangs o'er her son; in his embraces dies; Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes: Few words she spoke, tho' much she had to say, And scarce those few, for tears, could force their way. Light of my eyes! he comes! unhop'd-for joy! Has heav'n from Pylos brought my lovely boy? So snatch'd from all our cares!—Tell, hast thou known Thy father's fate, and tell me all thy own. Oh dearest, most rever'd of womankind! Cease with those tears to melt a manly mind, (Reply'd the Prince) nor be our fates deplor'd, From death and treason to thy arms restor'd. Go bathe, and rob'd in white, ascend the tow'rs; With all thy handmaids thank th' immortal Pow'rs; To ev'ry God vow hecatombs to bleed, And call Jove's vengeance on their guilty deed. While to th' assembled council I repair; A stranger sent by Heav'n attends me there; There is a vein of sincere piety that runs thro' the words and actions of Telemachus: he has no sooner delivered his mother from her uneasy apprehensions concerning his safety, but he proceeds to another act of virtue toward Theoclymenus, whom he had taken into his protection: He performs his duty towards men and towards the Gods. It is by his direction that Penelope offers up her devotions for success, and thanks for his return. It is he who prescribes the manner of it; namely, by washing the hands, in token of the purity of mind requir'd by those who supplicate the Deities; and by putting on clean garments, to shew the reverence and regard with which their souls ought to be possest when they appear before the Gods. I am not sensible that the last ceremony is often mentioned in other parts of Homer; yet I doubt not but it was practis'd upon all religious solemnities. The moral of the whole is, that piety is a sure way to victory: Telemachus appears every where a good man, and for this reason he becomes at last an happy one; and his calamities contribute to his glory. My new-accepted guest I haste to find, Now to Piræus' honour'd charge consign'd. The matron heard, nor was his word in vain. She bath'd; and rob'd in white, with all her train, To ev'ry God vow'd hecatombs to bleed, And call'd Jove's vengeance on the guilty deed. Arm'd with his lance the Prince then past the gate; Two dogs behind, a faithful guard, await: Pallas his form with grace divine improves: The gazing crowd admires him as he moves. Him, gath'ring round, the haughty Suitors greet With semblance fair, but inward deep deceit. Their false addresses gen'rous he deny'd, Past on, and sate by faithful Mentor's side; With Antiphus, and Halitherses sage, (His father's counsellors, rever'd for age.) Of his own fortunes, and Ulysses' fame, Much ask'd the Seniors; till Piræus came. The stranger-guest pursu'd him clos'd behind; Whom when Telemachus beheld, he join'd. He, (when Piræus ask'd for slaves to bring The gifts and treasures of the Spartan King) Thus thoughtful answer'd: Those we shall not move, Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove: We know not yet the full event of all: Stabb'd in his Palace if your Prince must fall, Us, and our house if treason must o'erthrow, Better a friend possess them, than a foe: If death to these, and vengeance heav'n decree, Riches are welcome then, not else, to me. 'Till then, retain the gifts.—The Heroe said, And in his hand the willing stranger led. Then dis-array'd, the shining bath they sought, With unguents smooth, of polisht marble wrought; Obedient handmaids with assistant toil Supply the limpid wave, and fragrant oil: Then o'er their limbs refulgent robes they threw, And fresh from bathing, to their seats withdrew. The golden ew'r a Nymph attendant brings, Replenish'd from the pure, translucent springs; With copious streams that golden ew'r supplies A silver laver of capacious size. They wash: the table, in fair order spread, Is pil'd with viands and the strength of bread. Full opposite, before the folding gate, The pensive mother sits in humble state; Lowly she sate, and with dejected view The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew. The Prince and stranger shar'd the genial feast, 'Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceast. When thus the Queen. My son! my only friend! Say, to my mournful couch shall I ascend? Penelope had requested Telemachus to give her an account of his voyage to Pyle, and of what he had heard concerning Ulysses. He there wav'd the discourse, because the Queen was in public with her female attendants: by this conduct the Poet sustains both their characters; Penelope is impatient to hear of Ulysses, and this agrees with the affection of a tender wife; but the discovery being unseasonable, Telemachus forbears to satisfy her curiosity; in which he acts like a wise man. Here (observes Eustathius) she gently reproaches him for not satisfying her impatience concerning her husband; she insinuates that it is a piece of cruelty to permit her still to grieve, when it is in his power to give her comfort; and this induces him to gratify her desires. It ought to be observ'd, that Homer chuses a proper time for this relation; it was necessary that the Suitors should be ignorant of the story of Ulysses; Telemachus therefore makes it when they are withdrawn to their sports, and when none were present but friends. (The couch deserted now a length of years; The couch, for ever water'd with my tears) Say wilt thou not (ere yet the Suitor-crew Return, and riot shakes our walls a-new) Say wilt thou not the least account afford? The least glad tydings of my absent Lord? To her the youth. We reach'd the Pylian plains, Where Nestor, shepherd of his people, reigns. All arts of tenderness to him are known, Kind to Ulysses' race as to his own; No father, with a fonder grasp of joy, Strains to his bosom his long-absent boy. But all unknown, if yet Ulysses breathe, Or glide a spectre in the realms beneath? For farther search, his rapid steeds transport My lengthen'd journey to the Spartan court. There Argive Helen I beheld, whose charms Eustathius takes notice of the candid behaviour of Telemachus with respect to Helen: She had receiv'd him courteously, and he testifies his gratitude, by ascribing the calamities she drew upon her country to the decree of heav'n, not to her immodesty: This is particularly decent in the mouth of Telemachus, because he is now acquainted with his father's return; otherwise he could not have mention'd her name but to her dishonour, who had been the occasion of his death. (So Heav'n decreed) ingag'd the Great in arms. My cause of coming told, he thus rejoin'd; And still his words live perfect in my mind. Heav'ns! would a soft, inglorious, dastard train These verses are repeated from the fourth Odyssey; and are not without a good effect, they cannot fail of comforting Penelope, by assuring her that Ulysses is alive, and restrain'd by Calypso involuntarily; they give her hopes of his return, and the satisfaction of hearing his glory from the mouth of Menelaus. The conciseness of Telemachus is likewise remarkable; he re-capitulates in thirty eight lines the subject of almost three books, the third, the fourth and fifth; he selects every circumstance that can please Penelope, and drops those that would give her pain. An absent Heroe's nuptial joys prophane! So with her young, amid the woodland shades, A tim'rous hind the lion's court invades, Leaves in that fatal lair her tender fawns, And climbs the cliff, or feeds along the lawns; Mean-time returning, with remorseless sway The Monarch savage tends the panting prey: With equal fury, and with equal fame, Shall great Ulysses re-assert his claim. O Jove! Supreme! whom men and Gods revere; And thou whose lustre gilds the rowling sphere! With pow'r congenial join'd, propitious aid The Chief adopted by the martial maid! Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when, contending on the Lesbian shore, His prowess Philomelides confest, And loud-acclaiming Greeks the victor blest: Then soon th'invaders of his bed, and throne, Their love presumptuous shall by death atone. Now what you question of my antient friend, With truth I answer; thou the truth attend. Learn what I heard the sea-born Seer relate, Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate. Sole in an Isle, imprison'd by the main, The sad survivor of his num'rous train, Ulysses lies; detain'd by magic charms, And prest unwilling in Calypso's arms. No sailors there, no vessels to convey, Nor oars to cut th'immeasurable way— This told Atrides, and he told no more. Thence safe I voyag'd to my native shore. He ceas'd; nor made the pensive Queen reply, But droop'd her head, and drew a secret sigh. When Theoclymenus the seer began: It is with great judgment that the Poet here introduces Theoclymenus; he is a person that has no direct relation to the story of the Odyssey, yet because he appears accidentally in it, Homer unites him very artificially with it, that he may not appear to no purpose, and as an useless ornament. He here speaks as an Augur, and what he utters contributes to the perseverance of Penelope in resisting the addresses of the Suitors, by assuring her of the return of Ulysses; and consequently in some degree Theoclymenus promotes the principal action. But it may be said, if it was necessary that Penelope should be informed of his return, why does not Telemachus assure her of it, who was fully acquainted with the truth? The answer is, that Penelope is not to be fully inform'd, but only encouraged by a general hope: Theoclymenus speaks from his art, which may possibly be liable to error; but Telemachus must have spoken from knowledge, which would have been contrary to the injunctions of Ulysses, and might have prov'd fatal by an unseasonable discovery: It was therefore judicious in the Poet to put the assurance of the return of Ulysses into the mouth of Theoclymenus, and not of Telemachus. There is an expression in this speech, which in the Greek is remarkable; literally it is to be render'd, Ulysses is now sitting or creeping in Ithaca, ?????? ? ?????; that is, Ulysses is return'd and conceal'd: It is taken from the posture of a person in the act of endeavouring to hide himself: he sits down or creeps upon the ground. Eustathius explains it by ?????, ??? ?? ???? ????? ???????. Oh suff'ring consort of the suff'ring man! What human knowledge could, those Kings might tell; But I the secrets of high Heav'n reveal. Before the first of Gods be this declar'd, Before the board whose blessings we have shar'd; Witness the genial rites, and witness all This house holds sacred in her ample wall! Ev'n now this instant, great Ulysses lay'd At rest, or wand'ring in his country's shade, Their guilty deeds, in hearing, and in view Secret revolves; and plans the vengeance due. Of this sure Auguries the Gods bestow'd, When first our vessel anchor'd in your road. Succeed those omens Heav'n! (the Queen rejoin'd) So shall our bounties speak a grateful mind; And ev'ry envy'd happiness attend The man, who calls Penelope his friend. Thus commun'd they: while in the marble court (Scene of their insolence) the Lords resort; Athwart the spacious square each tries his art Eustathius remarks, that tho' the Suitors were abandon'd to luxury, vice, and intemperance, yet they exercise themselves in laudable sports: They toss the quoit, or throw the javelin, which are both heroic diversions, and form the body into strength and activity. This is owing to the virtue of the age, not the persons: such sports were fashionable, and therefore used by the Suitors, and not because they were heroic. However they may instruct us never to give our selves up to idleness and inaction; but to make our very diversions subservient to nobler views, and turn a pleasure into a virtue. To whirl the disk, or aim the missile dart. Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive, And from the field the victim flocks they drive: Medon the herald (one who pleas'd them best, We may observe that the character of Medon is very particular; he is at the same time a favourite of the Suitors, and Telemachus, persons entirely opposite in their interests. It seldom happens that any man can please two parties, without acting an insincere part: Atticus was indeed equally acceptable to the two factions of Cæsar and Pompey, but it was because he seem'd neutral, and acted as if they were both his friends; or rather he was a man of such eminent virtues, that they esteem'd it an honour to have him thought their friend. Homer every where represents Medon as a person of integrity; he is artful, but not criminal: no doubt but he made all compliances, that consisted with probity, with the Suitor's dispositions; by this method he sav'd Penelope more effectually than if he had shew'd a more rigid virtue. He made himself master of their hearts by an insinuating behaviour, and was a spy upon their actions. Eustathius compares him to a buskin that fits both legs, ???? ??? ????????; he seems to have been an Anti-Cato, and practis'd a virtuous gayety. And honour'd with a portion of their feast) To bid the banquet interrupts their play. Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay Their garments, and succinct, the victims slay. Then sheep and goats and bristly porkers bled, And the proud steer was o'er the marble spread. While thus the copious banquet they provide; Along the road conversing side by side, Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain: When thus Eumæus, gen'rous and humane. To town, observant of our Lord's behest, Now let us speed; my friend, no more my guest! Yet like my self I wish'd thee here preferr'd, Guard of the flock, or keeper of the herd. Such little traits as these are very delightful; for the Reader knowing that the person to whom this offer is made, is Ulysses, cannot fail of being diverted to see the honest and loyal Eumæus promising to make his master and King the keeper of his herds or stalls, ???????; and this is offer'd as a piece of good fortune or dignity. But much to raise my master's wrath I fear; The wrath of Princes ever is severe. Then heed his will, and be our journey made While the broad beams of Phœbus are display'd. Or ere brown ev'ning spreads her chilly shade. Eustathius gathers from these words, that the time of the action of the Odyssey was in the end of autumn, or beginning of winter, when the mornings and evenings are cold: Thus Ulysses, in the beginning of this book, makes the coldness of the morning an excuse for not going with Telemachus; his rags being but an ill defense against it: and here Eumæus mentions the coldness of the evening, as a reason why they should begin their journey in the heat of the day; so that it was now probably about ten of the clock, and they arrive at Ithaca at noon: from hence we may conjecture, that the lodge of Eumæus was five or six miles from the city, that is, about a two hours walk. Just thy advice, (the prudent Chief rejoin'd) And such as suits the dictate of my mind. Lead on: but help me to some staff to stay My feeble step, since rugged is the way. Across his shoulders, then, the scrip he flung, Wide patch'd, and fasten'd by a twisted thong. A staff Eumæus gave. Along the way Chearly they fare: Behind, the keepers stay; These with their watchful dogs (a constant guard) It is certain that if these little particulars had been omitted, there would have been no chasm in the connection; why then does Homer insert such circumstances unnecessarily, which it must be allowed are of no importance, and add nothing to the perfection of the story? nay, they are such as may be thought trivial, and unworthy the dignity of Epic Poetry. But, as Dacier very well observes, they are a kind of painting: Were a Painter to draw this subject, he would undoubtedly insert into the piece these herdsmen and dogs after the manner of Homer; they are natural ornaments, and consequently are no disgrace either to the Poet or the Painter. It is observable that Homer gives us an exact draught of the country; he sets before us, as in a picture, the city, the circular grove of poplars adjacent, the fountain falling from a rock, and the Altar sacred to the Nymphs, erected on the point of it. We are as it were transported into Ithaca, and travel with Ulysses and Eumæus: Homer verifies the observation of Horace above all Poets; namely, that Poetry is Painting. Supply his absence, and attend the herd. And now his city strikes the Monarch's eyes, Alas! how chang'd! a man of miseries; Propt on a staff, a beggar old and bare, In rags dishonest flutt'ring with the air! Now pass'd the rugged road, they journey down The cavern'd way descending to the town, Where, from the rock, with liquid lapse distills A limpid fount; that spread in parting rills Its current thence to serve the city brings: An useful work! adorn'd by antient Kings. Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor Public benefactions demand public honours and acknowledgments; for this reason Homer makes an honourable mention of these three brothers. Ithaca was a small Island, and destitute of plenty of fresh water; this fountain therefore was a public good to the whole region about it; and has given immortality to the Authors of it. They were the sons of Pterelaus (as Eustathius informs us) Ithacus gave name to the country, Neritus to a mountain, and Polyctor to a place call'd Polyctorium. there In sculptur'd stone immortaliz'd their care, In marble urns receiv'd it from above, And shaded with a green surrounding grove; Where silver alders, in high arches twin'd, Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind. Beneath, sequester'd to the nymphs, is seen A mossie altar, deep embower'd in green; Where constant vows by travellers are pay'd, And holy horrors solemnize the shade. Here with his goats, (not vow'd to sacred flame, But pamper'd luxury) Melanthius came; Two grooms attend him. With an envious look He ey'd the stranger, and imperious spoke. The good old proverb how this pair fulfill! One rogue is usher to another still. Heav'n with a secret principle indu'd Mankind, to seek their own similitude. Where goes the swine-herd with that ill-look'd guest? That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast! Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn, From ev'ry great man's gate repuls'd with scorn? To no brave prize aspir'd the worthless swain, 'Twas but for scraps he ask'd, and ask'd in vain. Dacier is very singular in her interpretation of this passage: She imagines it has a reference to the games practis'd amongst the Suitors, and to the rewards of the victors, which were usually Tripods and beautiful captives. “Thinkest thou (says Melanthius) that this beggar will obtain the victory in our sports, and that they will give him as the reward of his valour, some beautiful slave, or some precious Tripod?” But in Homer there is nothing that gives the least countenance to this explication: He thus literally speaks: This fellow by going from door to door will meet with correction, while he begs meanly for a few scraps, not for things of price, such as a captive or Tripod. Eustathius explains it as spoken in contempt of Ulysses; that he appears to be such a vile person, as to have no ambition or hope to expect any thing better than a few scraps, nor to aspire to the rewards of nobler strangers, such as captives or Tripods. ??????, says the same Author, are the minutest crumbs of bread, ??????????? ?????. I am persuaded, that the Reader will subscribe to the judgment of Eustathius, if he considers the construction, and that ????? and ??????? are govern'd by ??????? as effectually as ???????, and therefore must refer to the same act of begging, not of claiming by victory in the games; ??????? is not a word that can here express a reward, but only a charity: besides, would it not be absurd to say that a Beggar goes from door to door asking alms, and not rewards bestow'd upon victors in public exercises? the words ??????? ?????? make the sense general, they denote the life of a beggar, which is to go from door to door, and consequently they ought not to be confin'd solely to the Suitors, and if not, they can have no reference to any games, or to any rewards bestowed upon such occasions. Besides it is scarce to be conceiv'd that Melanthius could think this Beggar capable of being admitted into the company, much less into the diversions of the Suitors, who were all persons of high birth and station. 'Tis true, Lib. 21. Ulysses is permitted to try the bow, but this is through the peculiar grace of Telemachus, who knew the Beggar to be Ulysses; and entirely contrary to their injunctions. From this Passage we may correct an error in Hesychius: ????? (says he) are ???????? ??? ????????: the sentence is evidently maim'd, for Hesychius undoubtedly thus wrote it, ????? ???????? ????????, for thus (adds he) Homer uses it: ? ??? ????? ???? ???????. that is (says Hesychius) ?????????? ???? ????????, referring to this Verse of the Odyssey. To beg, than work, he better understands; Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands. For any office could the slave be good, To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food, If any labour those big joints could learn; Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn. To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread, Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed. Yet hear me! if thy impudence but dare Approach yon walls, I prophesy thy fare: Dearly, full dearly shalt thou buy thy bread With many a footstool thund'ring at thy head. He thus: nor insolent of word alone, Spurn'd with his rustic heel his King unknown; Spurn'd, but not mov'd: He, like a pillar stood, Nor stirr'd an inch, contemptuous, from the road: Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead, Or greet the pavement with his worthless head. Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inur'd, The Heroe stood self-conquer'd, and endur'd. Homer excellently sustains the character of Ulysses; he is a Man of patience, and master of all his passions; he is here misused by one of his own servants, yet is so far from returning the injury, that he stifles the sense of it, without speaking one word: 'Tis true he is describ'd as having a conflict in his Soul; but this is no derogation to his character: not to feel like a man, is Insensibility, not Virtue; but to repress the emotions of the heart, and keep them within the bounds of moderation, this argues wisdom, and turns an injury into a virtue and glory. There is an excellent contrast between the benevolent Eumæus, and the insolent Melanthius. Eumæus resents the Outrage of Melanthius more than Ulysses; he is moved with indignation but how does he express it? not by railing, but by an appeal to Heaven in a prayer: A conduct worthy to be imitated in more enlighten'd ages. The word ??????? here bears a peculiar signification; it does not imply Voluptuousness as usually, but Pride, and means that Ulysses would spoil his haughty airs, if he should ever return: This interpretation agrees with what follows, where Eumæus reproaches him for despising his rural charge, and aspiring to politeness, or as we express it, to be a Man of the Town. But hateful of the wretch, Eumæus heav'd His hands obtesting, and this pray'r conceiv'd. Daughters of Jove! who from th' ætherial bow'rs Descend to swell the springs, and feed the flow'rs! Nymphs of this fountain! to whose sacred names Our rural victims mount in blazing flames! To whom Ulysses' piety preferr'd The yearly firstlings of his flock, and herd; Succeed my wish; your votary restore: Oh be some God his convoy to our shore! Due pains shall punish then this slave's offence, And humble all his airs of insolence, Who proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large, Commences courtier, and neglects his charge. What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins) This crafty miscreant big with dark designs? The day shall come; nay, 'tis already near, When slave! to sell thee at a price too dear, Must be my care; and hence transport thee o'er, (A load and scandal to this happy shore.) Oh! that as surely great Apollo's dart, Or some brave Suitor's sword, might pierce the heart Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour In lasting safety from the father's pow'r. So spoke the wretch; but shunning farther fray, Turn'd his proud step, and left them on their way. Strait to the feast-full palace he repair'd, Familiar enter'd, and the banquet shar'd; Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord, We may gather from hence the truth of an observation formerly made, That Melanthius, Eumæus, &amp;c. were persons of distinction, and their offices posts of honour: we see Melanthius, who had charge of the Goats of Ulysses, is a companion for Princes. The reason why Melanthius in particular associates himself with Eurymachus is, an intrigue which that Prince holds with Melantho his sister, as appears from the following Book. There is a confederacy and league between them, and we find they all suffer condign punishment in the end of the Odyssey. He took his place, and Plenty heap'd the board. Mean-time they heard, soft-circling in the sky, Sweet Airs ascend, and heav'nly minstrelsie; (For Phemius to the Lyre attun'd the strain:) Ulysses harkned, then addrest the swain. Well may this Palace admiration claim, Great, and respondent to the master's fame! Stage above stage th' imperial structure stands, Holds the chief honours and the town commands: High walls and battlements the courts inclose, We have here a very particular draught or plan of the palace of Ulysses; it is a kind of castle, at once design'd for strength and magnificence: this we may gather from ??????????????, which Hesychius explains by ???????????, ?????????, not easily to be surmounted, or forc'd by arms. Homer artfully introduces Ulysses struck with wonder at the beauty of the palace; this is done to confirm Eumæus in the opinion that Ulysses is really the Beggar he appears to be, and a perfect stranger among the Ithacans: Thus also when he complains of hunger, he speaks the language of a Beggar, as Eustathius remarks, to persuade Eumæus that he takes his journey to the Court, solely out of want and hunger. And the strong gates defy a host of foes. Far other cares its dwellers now employ; The throng'd assembly, and the feast of joy: I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire, And hear (what graces ev'ry feast) the Lyre. Then thus Eumæus. Judge we which were best; Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest Chuse you to mingle, while behind I stay? Or I first ent'ring introduce the way? Wait for a space without, but wait not long; This is the house of violence and wrong: Some rude insult thy rev'rend age may bear; For like their lawless lords, the servants are. Just is, oh friend! thy caution, and addrest (Reply'd the Chief) to no unheedful breast; The wrongs and injuries of base mankind Fresh to my sense, and always in my mind. The bravely-patient to no fortune yields: On rolling oceans, and in fighting fields, Storms have I past, and many a stern debate; And now in humbler scene submit to Fate. What cannot Want? the best she will expose, And I am learn'd in all her train of woes; She fills with navies, hosts, and loud alarms The sea, the land, and shakes the world with arms! Thus, near the gates conferring as they drew, Argus, the Dog, his antient master knew; This whole Episode has fallen under the ridicule of the Critics; Monsieur Perault in particular: “The Dunghill before the Palace (says that Author) is more proper for a Peasant than a King; and it is beneath the dignity of Poetry to describe the Dog Argus almost devour'd with vermin.” It must be allow'd, that such a familiar Episode could not have been properly introduced into the Iliad: It is writ in a nobler style, and distinguish'd by a boldness of sentiments and diction; whereas the Odyssey descends to the Familiar, and is calculated more for common than heroic life. What Homer says of Argus is very natural, and I do not know any thing more beautiful or more affecting in the whole Poem: I dare appeal to every person's judgment, if Argus be not as justly and properly represented, as the noblest figure in it. It is certain that the vermin which Homer mentions would debase our Poetry, but in the Greek that very word is noble and sonorous, ????????????: But how is the objection concerning the Dunghill to be answer'd? We must have recourse to the simplicity of manners amongst the Antients, who thought nothing mean, that was of use to life. Ithaca was a barren Country, full of Rocks and Mountains, and ow'd its fertility chiefly to cultivation, and for this reason such circumstantial cares were necessary. 'Tis true such a description now is more proper for a Peasant than a King, but antiently it was no disgrace for a King to perform with his own hands, what is now left only to Peasants. We read of a Dictator taken from the plough, and why may not a King as well manure his field as plough it, without receding from his dignity? Virgil has put the same thing into a Precept: Ne saturare fimo pingui pudeat sola. He, not unconscious of the voice, and tread, Lifts to the sound his ear, and rears his head. Bred by Ulysses, nourish'd at his board, But ah! not fated long to please his Lord! To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain; The voice of Glory call'd him o'er the main. 'Till then in ev'ry sylvan chace renown'd, With Argus, Argus, rung the woods around; With him the youth pursu'd the goat or fawn, Or trac'd the mazy leveret o'er the lawn. Now left to man's ingratitude he lay, Un-hous'd, neglected, in the publick way; And where on heaps the rich manure was spread, Obscene with Reptiles, took his sordid bed. He knew his Lord; he knew, and strove to meet, In vain he strove, to crawl, and kiss his feet; It may seem that this circumstance was inserted casually, or at least only to shew the age and infirmity of Argus: but there is a further intent in it: If the Dog had ran to Ulysses and fawn'd upon him, it would have rais'd a strong suspicion in Eumæus that he was not such a stranger to the Ithacans as he pretended, but some person in disguise; and this might have occasioned an unseasonable discovery. Eustathius. Yet (all he could) his tail, his ears, his eyes Salute his master, and confess his joys. Soft pity touch'd the mighty master's soul; I confess my self touch'd with the tenderness of these tears in Ulysses; I would willingly think that they proceed from a better principle than the weakness of human nature, and are an instance of a really virtuous and compassionate disposition. ? ?????, ?? ?????????? ?????. Good men are easily mov'd to Tears: In my judgment, Ulysses appears more amiable while he weeps over his faithful Dog, than when he drives an army of enemies before him: That shews him to be a great Heroe, This a good Man. It was undoubtedly an instance of an excellent disposition in one of the Fathers who pray'd for the Grace of Tears. ? mollissima corda Humano generi dare se natura fatetur Quæ lachrymas dedit, hæc nostri pars optima sensus. Juv. Sat. 15. And Dryden, Each gentle mind the soft infection felt, For richest metals are most apt to melt. Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole, Stole unperceiv'd; he turn'd his head, and dry'd The drop humane: then thus impassion'd cry'd. What noble beast in this abandon'd state Lies here all helpless at Ulysses' gate? His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise; If, as he seems, he was in better days, Some care his Age deserves: Or was he priz'd For worthless beauty? therefore now despis'd? Such dogs, and men there are, meer things of state, It is the Greek ???????, or Kings; but the word is not to be taken in too strict a sense; it implies all persons of distinction, or ????????????, like the word Rex in Horace. Regibus hic mos est ubi equos mercantur. And Reginæ in Terence (as Dacier observes) is used in the same manner. ? Eunuchum porrò dixti velle te: Quia solæ utuntur his reginæ. And always cherish'd by their friends, the Great. Not Argus so, (Eumæus thus rejoin'd) But serv'd a master of a nobler kind, Who never, never shall behold him more! Long, long since perish'd on a distant shore! Oh had you seen him, vig'rous, bold and young, Swift as a stag, and as a lion strong; Him no fell Savage on the plain withstood, None 'scap'd him, bosom'd in the gloomy wood; His eye how piercing, and his scent how true, To winde the vapour in the tainted dew? Such, when Ulysses left his natal coast; Now years un-nerve him, and his lord is lost! The women keep the gen'rous creature bare, A sleek and idle race is all their care: The master gone, the servants what restrains? Or dwells Humanity where riot reigns? Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away. This is a very remarkable sentence, and commonly found to be true. Longinus in his enquiry into the decay of human wit quotes it. “Servitude, be it never so justly established, is a kind of prison, wherein the soul shrinks in some measure, and diminishes by constraint: it has the same effect with the boxes in which dwarfs are inclos'd, which not only hinder the body from its growth, but make it less by the constriction. It is observable that all the great Orators flourish'd in Republics, and indeed what is there that raises the souls of great men more than Liberty? In other governments men commonly become instead of Orators, pompous flatterers: A man born in servitude may be capable of other sciences; but no slave can ever be an Orator; for while the mind is deprest and broken by slavery, it will never dare to think or say any thing bold and noble; all the vigour evaporates, and it remains as it were confin'd in a prison. Etiam fera animalia, si clausa teneas, virtutis obliviscuntur. Tacit. Hist. lib. 4. These verses are quoted in Plato, lib. 6. de legibus, but somewhat differently from our editions. ?)/???? ??? ?? ???? ??????????? ??????? ???? ????? ??? ?? ??,' &amp;c. However this aphorism is to be understood only generally, not universally; Eumæus who utters it is an instance to the contrary, who retains his virtue in a state of subjection; and Plato speaks to the same purpose, asserting that some slaves have been found of such virtue as to be preferr'd to a son or brother; and have often preserv'd their masters and their families. This said, the honest herdsman strode before: The musing Monarch pauses at the door: The Dog whom Fate had granted to behold His Lord, when twenty tedious years had roll'd, Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies; So clos'd for ever faithful Argus' eyes! It has been a question what occasion'd the death of Argus, at the instant he saw Ulysses: Eustathius imputes it to the joy he felt at the sight of his master. But there has another objection been started against Homer, for ascribing so long a life as twenty years to Argus, and that dogs never surpass the fifteenth year; but this is an error; Aristotle affirms, that some dogs live two and twenty, and other Naturalists subscribe to his judgment. Eustathius tells us, that other Writers agree, that some dogs live twenty four years. Pliny thus writes, Canes Laconici vivunt annis denis, fœmina duodenis, cætera genera quindecim annos, aliquando viginti. Madam Dacier mentions some of her own knowledge that liv'd twenty three years, and the Translator, not to fall short of these illustrious examples, has known one that died at twenty two, big with puppies. And now Telemachus, the first of all, Observ'd Eumæus ent'ring in the hall; Distant he saw, across the shady Dome; Then gave a sign, and beckon'd him to come. There stood an empty seat, where late was plac'd In order due, the steward of the feast, (Who now was busied carving round the board) Eumæus took, and plac'd it near his Lord. Before him instant was the banquet spread, And the bright basket pil'd with loaves of bread. Next came Ulysses, lowly at the door, A figure despicable, old, and poor, In squalid vests with many a gaping rent, Propt on a staff, and trembling as he went. Then, resting on the threshold of the gate, Against a cypress pillar lean'd his weight; (Smooth'd by the workman to a polish'd plain) The thoughtful Son beheld, and call'd his swain: These viands, and this bread, Eumæus! bear, And let yon mendicant our plenty share: Then let him circle round the Suitors' board, And try the bounty of each gracious lord. Bold let him ask, encourag'd thus by me; How ill, alas! do want and shame agree? We are not to imagine that Homer is here recommending immodesty: but to understand him as speaking of a decent assurance, in opposition to a faulty shame or bashfulness. The verse in the ????? ?? ??? ????? ????????? ????? ???????. A person of great learning has observed that there is a tautology in the three last words; in a beggar that wants: as if the very notion of a beggar did not imply want. Indeed Plato, who cites this verse in his Charmides, uses another word instead of ???????, and inserts ???????. Hesiod likewise, who makes use of the same line, instead of ??????? reads ???????, which would almost induce us to believe that they thought there was a tautology in Homer. It has therefore been conjectur'd, that the word ???????? should be inserted in the place of ???????; I am sorry that the construction will not allow it; that word is of the masculine gender, and ????? which is of the feminine cannot agree with it. We may indeed substitute ??????, and then the sense will be bashfulness is no good petitioner for a beggar; but this must be done without authority. We must therefore thus understand Homer; “Too much modesty is not good for a poor man, who lives by begging, ???????; and this solution clears the verse from the tautology, for a man may be in want, and not be a beggar; or (as Homer expresses it) ??????????, and yet not ????????. His lord's command the faithful servant bears; The seeming beggar answers with his pray'rs. Blest be Telemachus! in ev'ry deed Inspire him Jove! in ev'ry wish succeed! This said, the portion from his son convey'd With smiles receiving, on his scrip he lay'd. Long as the minstrel swept the sounding wire, He fed, and ceas'd when silence held the lyre. Soon as the Suitors from the banquet rose, Minerva prompts the Man of mighty woes This is a circumstance that occurs almost in every book of the Odyssey, and Pallas has been thought to mean no more than the inherent wisdom of Ulysses, which guides all his actions upon all emergencies: It is not impossible but the Poet might intend to inculcate, that the wisdom of man is the gift of Heaven, and a blessing from the Gods. But then is it not a derogation to Ulysses, to think nothing but what the Goddess dictates? and a restraint of human liberty, to act solely by the impulse of a Deity? Plutarch in his life of Coriolanus excellently solves this difficulty. “Men (observes that Author) are ready to censure and despise the Poet, as if he destroy'd the use of reason, and the freedom of their choice, by continually ascribing every suggestion of heart to the influence of a Goddess: Whereas he introduces a Deity not to take away the liberty of the will, but as moving it to act with freedom; the Deity does not work in us the inclinations, but only offers the object to our minds, from whence we conceive the impulse, and form our resolutions.” However these influences do not make the action involuntary, but only give a beginning to spontaneous operations; for we must either remove God from all manner of causality, or confess that he invisibly assists us by a secret co-operation. For it is absurd to imagine that the help he lends us, consists in fashioning the postures of the body, or directing the corporeal motions; but in influencing our souls, and exciting the inward faculties into action by secret impulses from above; or on the contrary, by raising an aversion in the soul, to restrain us from action. 'Tis true in ordinary affairs of life, in matters that are brought about by the ordinary way of reason, Homer ascribes the execution of them to human performance, and frequently represents his Heroes calling a council in their own breasts, and acting according to the dictates of reason: But in actions unaccountably daring, of a transcendent nature, there they are said to be carry'd away by a divine impulse or enthusiasm, and it is no longer human reason, but a God that influences the soul. I have already observ'd, that Homer makes use of Machines sometimes meerly for ornament; this place is an instance of it: Here is no action of an uncommon nature perform'd, and yet Pallas directs Ulysses: Plutarch very justly observes, that whenever the Heroes of Homer execute any prodigious exploit of valour, he continually introduces a Deity, who assists in the performance of it; but it is also true, that to shew the dependance of man upon the assistance of Heaven, he frequently ascribes the common dictates of wisdom to the Goddess of it. If we take the act here inspired by Minerva, as it lies nakedly in Homer it is no more than a bare command to beg; an act, that needs not the wisdom of a Goddess to command: But we are to understand it as a direction to Ulysses how to behave before the Suitors upon his first appearance, how to carry on his disguise so artfully as to prevent all suspicions, and take his measures so effectually as to work his own re-establishment: In this light, the command becomes worthy of a Goddess: The act of begging is only the method by which he carries on his design; the consequence of it is the main point in view, namely, the Suitors destruction. The rest is only the stratagem, by which he obtains the victory. To tempt their bounties with a suppliant's art, And learn the gen'rous from th'ignoble heart; A single virtue, or act of humanity, is not a sufficient atonement for a whole life of insolence and oppression; so that altho' some of the Suitors should be found less guilty than the rest, yet they are still too guilty to deserve impunity. (Not but his soul, resentful as humane, Dooms to full vengeance all th' offending train) With speaking eyes, and voice of plaintive sound, Homer inserts this particularity to shew the complying nature of Ulysses in all fortunes; he is every where ??????????, it is his distinguishing character in the first verse of the Odyssey, and it is visible in every part of it. He is an artist in the trade of begging as Eustathius observes, and knows how to become the lowest, as well as the highest station. Homer adds, that the Suitors were struck with wonder at the fight of Ulysses. This is (says Eustathius) because they had never before seen him in Ithaca, and concluded him to be a foreigner. But I rather think it is a compliment Homer pays to his Heroe to represent his port and figure to be such, as tho' a beggar, struck them with astonishment. Humble he moves, imploring all around. The proud feel pity, and relief bestow, With such an image touch'd of human woe; Enquiring all, their wonder they confess, And eye the man, majestic in distress. While thus they gaze and question with their eyes, The bold Melanthius to their thought replies. My Lords! this stranger of gigantic port The good Eumæus usher'd to your court. Full well I mark'd the features of his face, Tho' all unknown his clime, or noble race. And is this present, swineherd! of thy hand? Bring'st thou these vagrants to infest the land? (Returns Antinous with retorted eye) Objects uncouth! to check the genial joy. Enough of these our court already grace, Of giant stomach, and of famish'd face. Such guests Eumæus to his country brings, To share our feast, and lead the life of Kings. To whom the hospitable swain rejoin'd: Thy passion, Prince, belies thy knowing mind. Who calls, from distant nations to his own, The poor, distinguish'd by their wants alone? Round the wide world are sought those men divine This is an evidence of the great honour antiently paid to persons eminent in mechanic arts: The Architect, and publick artisans, ??????????, are joyn'd with the Prophet, Physician, and Poet, who were esteem'd almost with a religious veneration, and look'd upon as public blessings. Honour was antiently given to men in proportion to the benefits they brought to society: A useless great man is a burthen to the earth, while the meanest artisan is beneficial to his fellow-creatures, and useful in his generation. Who publick structures raise, or who design; Those to whose eyes the Gods their ways reveal, Or bless with salutary arts to heal; But chief to Poets such respect belongs, By rival nations courted for their songs; These States invite, and mighty Kings admire, Wide as the sun displays his vital fire. It is not so with Want! how few that feed A wretch unhappy, meerly for his need? Unjust to me and all that serve the state, To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate. For me, suffice the approbation won Of my great mistress, and her god-like son. To him Telemachus. No more incense The man by nature prone to insolence: Injurious minds just answers but provoke— Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke. Thanks to thy care! whose absolute command Thus drives the stranger from our court and land. Heav'n bless its owner with a better mind! From envy free, to charity inclin'd. This both Penelope and I afford: Then, Prince! be bounteous of Ulysses' board. To give another's is thy hand so slow? So much more sweet, to spoil, than to bestow? Whence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain? (Antinous cries with insolent disdain) Portions like mine if ev'ry Suitor gave, Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave. He spoke, and lifting high above the board His pond'rous footstool, shook it at his lord. The rest with equal hand conferr'd the bread; He fill'd his scrip, and to the threshold sped; But first before Antinous stopt, and said. Bestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst Ulysses here acts with a prudent dissimulation; he pretends not to have understood the irony of Antinous, nor to have observ'd his preparation to strike him; and therefore proceeds as if he apprehended no danger. This at once shews the patience of Ulysses who is inur'd to sufferings, and gives a foundation for the punishment of Antinous in the conclusion of the Odyssey. It is observable, that Ulysses gives his own History in the same words as in the fourteenth book, yet varies from it in the conclusion; he there spoke to Eumæus, and Eumæus is here present, and hears the story: How is it then that he does not observe the falsification of Ulysses, and conclude him to be an impostor? Eustathius labours for an answer; he imagines that Eumæus was inadvertent, or had forgot the former relation, and yet asserts that the reason why Ulysses tells the same History in part to Antinous, proceeds from a fear of detection in Eumæus. I would rather imagine that Ulysses makes the deviation, trusting to the judgment of Eumæus, who might conclude that there was some good reason why he forbears to let Antinous into the full History of his life; especially, because he was an enemy both to Ulysses and Eumæus: he might therefore easily reflect, that the difference of his story arose from prudence and design, rather than from imposture and falshood. Of all the Greeks, but Prince-like and the first, Then as in dignity, be first in worth, And I shall praise thee thro' the boundless earth. Once I enjoy'd in luxury of state Whate'er gives man the envy'd name of Great; Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days; And hospitality was then my praise; In every sorrowing soul I pour'd delight, And poverty stood smiling in my sight. But Jove, all-governing, whose only will Determines Fate, and mingles good with ill, Sent me (to punish my pursuit of gain) With roving pyrates o'er th' Ægyptian main: By Ægypt's silver flood our ships we moor; Our spies commission'd strait the coast explore; But impotent of mind, with lawless will The country ravage, and the natives kill. The spreading clamor to their city flies, And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise: The red'ning dawn reveals the hostile fields Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields: Jove thunder'd on their side: our guilty head We turn'd to flight; the gath'ring vengeance spread On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead. Some few the foes in servitude detain; Death ill exchang'd for bondage and for pain! Unhappy me a Cyprian took a-board, And gave to Dmetor, Cyprus' haughty Lord: We are not to search too exactly into historic truth among the fictions of Poetry; but it is very probable that this Dmetor was really King of Cyprus. Eustathius is of this opinion; but it may be objected, that Cinyras was King of Cyprus in the time of Ulysses. Thus lib. XI. Iliad. The beaming Cuirass next adorn'd his breast: The same which once King Cinyras possest; The fame of Greece, and her assembled host, Had reach'd that Monarch on the Cyprian coast. The answer is, there were almost twenty years elapsed since the mention of this breast-plate of Cinyras; this King therefore being dead, Dmetor possest the Cyprian throne. Hither, to 'scape his chains, my course I steer, Still curst by fortune, and insulted here! To whom Antinous thus his rage exprest. What God has plagu'd us with this gormaund guest? Unless at distance, wretch! thou keep behind, Another Isle than Cyprus more unkind, Another Ægypt, shalt thou quickly find. This passage is a full demonstration that the country was call'd Ægypt in the days of Homer, as well as the river Nilus; for in the speech he uses ???????? in the masculine gender to denote the river, and here he calls it ?????? ???????? in the feminine, to shew that he speaks of the country: The former word agreeing with ???????, the latter with ????. From all thou beg'st, a bold audacious slave; Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave. Nor wonder I, at such profusion shown; Shameless they give, who give what's not their own. The Chief, retiring. Souls, like that in thee, Ill suit such forms of grace and dignity. Nor will that hand to utmost need afford The smallest portion of a wasteful board, Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps, Yet starving Want, amidst the riot, weeps. The haughty Suitor with resentment burns, And sow'rly smiling, this reply returns. Take that, ere yet thou quit this princely throng: And dumb for ever be thy sland'rous tongue! He said, and high the whirling tripod flung. His shoulder-blade receiv'd th' ungentle shock; He stood, and mov'd not, like a marble rock; But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain'd, Sedate of soul, his character sustain'd, And inly form'd revenge: then back withdrew; Before his feet the well-fill'd scrip he threw, And thus with semblance mild addrest the crew. May what I speak your princely minds approve, Ye Peers and rivals in this noble love! Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause. The reasoning of Ulysses in the original is not without some obscurity: For how can it be affirm'd, that it is no great affliction to have our property invaded, and to be wounded in the defence of it? The beggar who suffers for asking an alms, has no injury done him, except the violence offer'd to his person; but it is a double injury, to suffer both in our persons and properties. We must therefore suppose that Ulysses means, that the importance of the cause, when our rights are invaded, is equal to the danger, and that we ought to suffer wounds, or even death, in defence of it; and that a brave man grieves not at such laudable adventures. Or perhaps Ulysses speaks only with respect to Antinous, and means that it is a greater injury to offer violence to the poor and the stranger, than to persons of greater fortunes and station. Eustathius gives a deeper meaning to the speech of Ulysses; he applies it to his present condition, and it is the same as if he had said openly, It would be no great matter if I had been wounded in defence of my Palace, and other properties, but to suffer only for asking an alms, this is a deep affliction. So that Ulysses speaks in general, but intends his own particular condition; and the import of the whole is, I grieve to suffer, not upon any weighty account, but only for being poor and hungry. If, when the sword our country's quarrel draws, Or if defending what is justly dear, From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear; The gen'rous motive dignifies the scar. But for meer want, how hard to suffer wrong? Want brings enough of other ills along! Yet if injustice never be secure, If fiends revenge, and Gods assert the poor, Death shall lay low the proud aggressor's head, And make the dust Antinous' bridal bed. Peace wretch! and eat thy bread without offence, (The Suitor cry'd) or force shall drag thee hence, Scourge thro' the publick street, and cast thee there, A mangled carcase for the hounds to tear. His furious deed the gen'ral anger mov'd, All, ev'n the worst, condemn'd; and some reprov'd: Was ever Chief for wars like these renown'd? Ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound. Unblest thy hand! if in this low disguise Wander, perhaps, some inmate of the skies; They (curious oft of mortal actions) deign We have already observ'd, that it was the opinion of the antients, that the Gods frequently assum'd an human shape. Thus Ovid of Jupiter. ? Summe delabor Olympo, Et Deus humanâ lustro sub imagine terras. I refer the Reader to the objections of Plato, mention'd in the preceding book. It is observable, that Homer puts this remarkable truth into the mouth of the Suitors, to shew that it was certain and undeniable, when it is attested even by such persons as had no piety or religion. In forms like these, to round the earth and main, Just and unjust recording in their mind, And with sure eyes inspecting all mankind. Telemachus absorpt in thought severe, This is spoken with particular judgment; Telemachus is here to act the part of a wise man, not of a tender son; he restrains his tears lest they should betray his father, it being improbable that he should weep for a vagabond and beggar. We find he has profited by the instructions of Ulysses, and practises the injunctions given in the former book. ? If scorn insult my reverend age, Bear it, my son; repress thy rising rage. If outrag'd, cease that outrage to repell, Bear it, my son, tho' thy brave heart rebell. Telemachus struggles against the yearnings of nature, and shews himself to be a master of his passions; he must therefore be thought to exert an act of wisdom, not of insensibility. Nourish'd deep anguish, tho' he shed no tear; But the dark brow of silent sorrow shook: While thus his mother to her virgins spoke. “On him and his may the bright God of day “That base, inhospitable blow repay! The nurse replies: “If Jove receives my pray'r, “Not one survives to breath to-morrow's air. All, all are foes, and mischief is their end; Antinous most to gloomy death a friend; (Replies the Queen) the stranger begg'd their grace, And melting pity soften'd ev'ry face; From ev'ry other hand redress he found, But fell Antinous answer'd with a wound. Amidst her maids thus spoke the prudent Queen, Then bad Eumæus call the Pilgrim in. Much of th' experienc'd man I long to hear, If or his certain eye, or list'ning ear Have learn'd the fortunes of my wand'ring Lord? Thus she, and good Eumæus took the word. A private audience if thy grace impart, The stranger's words may ease the royal heart: His sacred eloquence in balm distils, And the sooth'd heart with secret pleasure fills. Three days have spent their beams, three nights have run Their silent journey, since his tale begun, Unfinish'd yet, and yet I thirst to hear! As when some heav'n-taught Poet charms the ear, (Suspending sorrow with celestial strain Breath'd from the Gods to soften human pain) Time steals away with unregarded wing, And the soul hears him, tho' he cease to sing. Ulysses late he saw, on Cretan ground, (His father's guest) for Minos' birth renown'd. Diodorus Siculus thus writes of Mines: “He was the son of Jupiter and Europa, who was fabled to be carried by a bull; (that is, in a ship called the bull, or that had the image of a bull carved upon its prow) into Crete: Here Minos reign'd, and built many Cities; he establish'd many laws among the Cretans; he also provided a navy, by which he subdued many of the adjacent Islands. The expression in the Greek will bear a two fold sense; and implies either, where Minos was born, or where the descendants of Minos reign; for Idomeneus, who govern'd Crete in the days of Ulysses, was a descendant of Minos, from his son Deucalion. Homer mentions it as an honour to Crete, to have given birth to so great a law-giver as Minos; and it is universally true, that every great man is an honour to his country: Athens did not give reputation to learn'd men, but learned men to Athens. He now but waits the wind, to waft him o'er With boundless treasure, from Thesprotia's shore. To this the Queen. The wand'rer let me hear, While yon luxurious race indulge their cheer, Devour the grazing ox and browzing goat, And turn my gen'rous vintage down their throat. For where's an arm, like thine Ulysses strong, To curb wild riot and to punish wrong? She spoke. Telemachus then sneez'd aloud; Eustathius fully explains the nature of this omen; for sneezing was reckon'd ominous both by the Greeks and Romans. While Penelope utter'd these words, Telemachus sneezes; Penelope accepts the omen, and expects the words to be verify'd. The original of the veneration paid to sneezing is this: The head is the most sacred part of the body, the seat of thought and reason: now the sneeze coming from the head, the Antients look'd upon it as a sign or omen, and believ'd it to be sent by Jupiter; therefore they regarded it with a kind of adoration: The Reader will have a full idea of the nature of the omen of sneezing here mention'd, from a singular instance in lib. 3. of Xenophon, in his expedition of Cyrus, Xenophon having ended a short speech to his soldiers with these words, viz. “We have many reasons to hope for preservation;” they were scarce utter'd, when a certain soldier sneez'd: the whole army took the omen, and at once paid adoration to the Gods; then Xenophon resuming his discourse, proceeded, Since, my fellow-soldiers, at the mention of our preservation, Jupiter has sent this omen, &amp;c. So that Xenophon fully explains Homer. Sneezing was likewise reckon'd ominous by the Romans. Thus Catullus, Hoc ut dixit, Amor sinistra ut ante Dextram sternuit adprobationem. Thus also Propertius, Num tibi nascenti primis, mea vita, diebus Aridus argutum sternuit omen amor. We find in all these instances that sneezing was constantly receiv'd as a good omen, or a sign of approbation from the Gods. In these ages we pay an idle superstition to sneezing, but it is ever look'd upon as a bad omen, and we cry God bless you, upon hearing it, as the Greeks in latter times said ???? or ??? ?????. We are told this custom arose from a mortal distemper that affected the head, and threw the patient into convulsive sneezings, that occasion'd his death. I will only add from Eustathius, that Homer expresses the loudness of the sneezing, to give a reason why Penelope heard it, she being in an apartment at some distance from Telemachus. The sneezing likewise gives us the reason why Penelope immediately commands Eumæus to introduce the beggar into her presence; the omen gave her hopes to hear of Ulysses, she saw the beggar was a stranger, and a traveller, and therefore expected he might be able to give her some information. Constrain'd, his nostril eccho'd thro' the crowd. The smiling Queen the happy omen blest: “So may these impious fall, by fate opprest! Then to Eumæus: Bring the stranger, fly! And if my questions meet a true reply, Grac'd with a decent robe he shall retire, A gift in season which his wants require. Thus spoke Penelope. Eumæus flies In duteous haste, and to Ulysses cries. The Queen invites thee, venerable guest! A secret instinct moves her troubled breast Of her long-absent Lord from thee to gain Some light, and sooth her soul's eternal pain. If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind Of decent robes a present has design'd; So finding favour in the royal eye, Thy other wants her subjects shall supply. Fair truth alone (the patient man reply'd) My words shall dictate, and my lips shall guide. To him, to me, one common lot was giv'n, In equal woes, alas! involv'd by heav'n. These words bear a double sense, one applicable to the speaker, the other to the Reader: The Reader, who knows this beggar to be Ulysses, is pleas'd with the conceal'd meaning, and hears with pleasure the beggar affirming that he is fully instructed in the misfortunes of Ulysses: But speaking in the character of a beggar, he keeps Eumæus in ignorance, who believes he is reciting the adventures of a friend, while he really gives his own History. Much of his fates I know; but check'd by fear I stand: the hand of violence is here: Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade, And injur'd suppliants seek in vain for aid. Let for a space the pensive Queen attend, Nor claim my story 'till the sun descend; Then in such robes as suppliants may require, Compos'd and chearful by the genial fire, When loud uproar and lawless riot cease, Shall her pleas'd ear receive my words in peace. Swift to the Queen returns the gentle swain: And, say (she cries) does fear, or shame, detain The cautious stranger? With the begging kind Shame suits but ill. Eumæus thus rejoin'd: He only asks a more propitious hour, And shuns (who wou'd not?) wicked men in power; At ev'ning mild (meet season to confer) By turns to question, and by turns to hear. Whoe'er this guest (the prudent Queen replies) His ev'ry step and ev'ry thought is wise. For men like these on earth he shall not find, In all the miscreant race of humankind. Thus she. Eumæus all her words attends, And parting, to the Suitor pow'rs descends: There seeks Telemachus, and thus apart In whispers breaths the fondness of his heart. The time, my Lord, invites me to repair Hence to the lodge; my charge demands my care. These sons of murder thirst thy life to take; O guard it, guard it, for thy servant's sake! Thanks to my friend, he cries; but now the hour The Reader may look back to the beginning of the preceding book, for the explication of ?????? ????, here mention'd by Homer. Of night draws on, go seek the rural bow'r: But first refresh: and at the dawn of day Hither a victim to the Gods convey. Our life to heav'n's immortal pow'rs we trust, Safe in their care, for heav'n protects the just. Observant of his voice, Eumæus sate And fed recumbent on a chair of state. Then instant rose, and as he mov'd along 'Twas riot all amid the Suitor-throng, They feast, they dance, and raise the mirthful song. 'Till now declining tow'rd the close of day, The sun obliquely shot his dewy ray. This book does not fully comprehend the space of one day: It begins with the morning, and ends before night, so that the time here mention'd by the Poet, is the evening of the thirty ninth day. THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Fight of Ulysses and Irus. The Beggar Irus insults Ulysses; the Suitors promote the Quarrel, in which Irus is worsted, and miserably handled. Penelope descends, and receives the Presents of the Suitors. The Dialogue of Ulysses with Eurymachus. Homer has been severely blam'd for describing Ulysses, a King, entring the lists with a beggar: Rapin affirms, that he demeans himself by engaging with an unequal adversary. The objection would be unanswerable, if Ulysses appear'd in his royal character: But it is as necessary in Epic Poetry as on the Theatre, to adapt the behaviour of every person to the character he is to represent, whether real or imaginary. Would it not have been ridiculous to have represented him, while he was disguis'd in the garb of a beggar, refusing the combat, because he knew himself to be a King? and would not such a conduct have endanger'd a discovery? Ought we not rather to look upon this Episode as an instance of the greatness of the calamities of Ulysses, who is reduced to such uncommon extremities as to be set upon a level with the meanest of wretches? While fix'd in thought the pensive Heroe sate; A Mendicant approach'd the royal gate; A surly vagrant of the giant kind, The stain of manhood, of a coward mind: From feast to feast, insatiate to devour He flew, attendant on the genial hour; When on his mother's knees a babe he lay, She nam'd Arnæus on his natal day, It seems probable from this passage, that the mother gave the name to the child in the days of Homer; tho' perhaps not without the concurrence of the father: Thus in the scriptures it is said of Leah, that she bare a son and called his name Reuben; and again, she called his name Simeon; and the same is frequently repeated both of Leah and Rachael. In the age of Aristophanes, the giving a name to the child seems to have been a divided prerogative between the father and mother: For in his ??????? there is dispute between Strepsiades and his wife, concerning the name of their son: The wife was of noble birth, and would therefore give him a noble name; the husband was a plain villager, and was rather for a name that denoted frugality: but the woman not waving the least branch of her prerogative, they compromis'd the affair, by giving the child a compounded name that imply'd both frugality and chivalry, derived from ????? to spare, and ????? an horse; and the young Cavalier's name was Phidippides. Eustathius affirms, that antiently the mother nam'd the child; and the Scholiast upon Aristophanes in avib. quotes a fragment from Euripides to this purpose, from a Play call'd Ægeus. ?? ?? ????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????. What was the name given on the tenth day by the mother to the child? Dacier tells us, that the name of Arnæus was prophetic ??? ??? ?????, from the sheep the glutton would devour when he came to manhood; but this is mere fancy, and it is no reason because he proved a glutton, that therefore the name foretold it: One might rather think the fondness of the mother toward her infant, suggested a very different view: She gave the name according to her wishes, and flatter'd her self that he would prove a very rich man, a man of many flocks and herds; and therefore she call'd him ???????: and this is the more probable, because all riches originally consisted in flocks and herds. But Irus his associates call'd the Boy, Practis'd, the common messenger to fly, Irus, a name expressive of th' employ. To understand this, we must have recourse to the derivation of the word Irus; it comes from ????, which signifies nuntio; Irus was therefore so call'd, because he was a public messenger; and Iris bears that name, as the messenger of the Gods; ????, ???????????? ???? ???????. Hesychius. From his own roof with meditated blows He strove to drive the Man of mighty woes. Hence dotard, hence! and timely speed thy way, Lest dragg'd in vengeance, thou repent thy stay; See how with nods assent yon princely train! But honouring age, in mercy I refrain; In peace away! lest if persuasions fail, This arm with blows more eloquent prevail. To whom with stern regards: O insolence, Indecently to rail without offence! What bounty gives, without a rival share, I ask, what harms not thee, to breathe this air: Alike on alms we both precarious live: And canst thou envy, when the great relieve? Know from the bounteous heav'ns all riches flow, And what man gives, the Gods by man bestow; Proud as thou art, henceforth no more be proud, Lest I imprint my vengeance in thy blood; Old as I am, should once my fury burn, How wouldst thou fly, nor ev'n in thought return? Mere woman-glutton! (thus the churl reply'd) A tongue so flippant, with a throat so wide! Why cease I, Gods! to dash those teeth away, These words refer to a custom that prevailed in former ages; it was allow'd to strike out the teeth of any beast which the owner found in his grounds: Eustathius informs us, that this was a custom or law among the people of Cyprus; but from what Homer here speaks, it seems to have been a general practice; at least it was in use amongst the Ithacans. Like some vile swine's, that greedy of his prey Uproots the bearded corn? rise, try the fight, Gird well the loins, approach, and feel my might: We may gather from hence the manner of the single combat; the champions fought naked, and only made use of a cincture round the loins out of decency. Homer directly affirms it, when Ulysses prepares for the fight. Then girding his strong loins, the King prepares To close in combat, and his body bares; Broad spread his shoulders, and his nervous thighs By just degrees like well-turn'd columns rise; Ample his chest, his arms are round and long, And each strong joint Minerva knits more strong. Thus Diomed in the Iliad girds his friend Euryalus when he engages Epæus. Officious with the cincture girds him round. The speeches here are short, and the periods remarkably concise, suitable to the nature of anger. The Reader may consult the Annotations on the 20?? book, concerning the Goat's entrails mention'd by Antinous. Sure of defeat, before the Peers engage; Unequal fight! when youth contends with age! Thus in a wordy war their tongues display More fierce intents, preluding to the fray; Antinous hears, and in a jovial vein, Thus with loud laughter to the Suitor-train. This happy day in mirth, my friends employ, And lo! the Gods conspire to crown our joy. See ready for the fight, and hand to hand, Yon surly mendicants contentious stand; Why urge we not to blows? Well-pleas'd they spring Swift from their seats, and thick'ning form a ring. To whom Antinous. Lo! enrich'd with blood A kid's well-fatted entrails (tasteful food!) On glowing embers lie; on him bestow The choicest portion who subdues his foe; Grant him unrival'd in these walls to stay, The sole attendant on the genial day. The Lords applaud: Ulysses then with art, And fears well-feign'd, disguis'd his dauntless heart: Worn as I am with age, decay'd with woe, Say is it baseness, to decline the foe? Hard conflict! when calamity and age With vigorous youth, unknown to cares, engage! Yet fearful of disgrace, to try the day Imperious hunger bids, and I obey; But swear, impartial arbiters of right, This is a very necessary precaution: Ulysses had reason to apprehend that the Suitors would interest themselves in the cause of Irus, who was their daily attendant, rather than in that of a perfect stranger. Homer takes care to point out the prudence of Ulysses upon every emergence: Besides, he raises this fray between two beggars into some dignity, by requiring the sanction of an oath to regulate the laws of the combat. It is the same solemnity used in the Iliad between Paris and Menelaus, and represents these combatants engaging with the formality of two Heroes. Swear, to stand neutral while we cope in fight. The Peers assent: when strait his sacred head Telemachus uprais'd, and sternly said. Stranger, if prompted to chastise the wrong Of this bold insolent, confide, be strong! Th' injurious Greek that dares attempt a blow, That instant makes Telemachus his foe; And these my Antinous and Eurymachus. friends shall guard the sacred ties When Telemachus speaks these words, he is to be supposed to turn to Eurymachus and Antinous, to whom he directs his discourse. It must be allow'd that this is an artful piece of flattery in Telemachus, and he makes use of it to engage these two Princes, who were the chief of the Suitors, on his side. Of hospitality, for they are wise. Then girding his strong loins, the King prepares To close in combat, and his body bares; Broad spread his shoulders, and his nervous thighs By just degrees like well-turn'd columns rise: Ample his chest, his arms are round and long, And each strong joint Minerva knits more strong, (Attendant on her chief:) the Suitor-crowd With wonder gaze, and gazing speak aloud; Irus, alas! shall Irus be no more, This is literally translated: I confess I wish Homer had omitted these little collusions of words: he sports with ???? ?????. It is a low conceit, alluding to the derivation of Irus, and means that he shall never more be a messenger. The translation, tho' it be verbal, yet is free from ambiguity, and the joke conceal'd in ?????: this will be evident if we substitute another name in the place of Irus; we may say Achilles shall be no longer Achilles, without descending from the gravity of Epic Poetry. Black fate impends, and this th' avenging hour! Gods! how his nerves a matchless strength proclaim: Swell o'er his well-strung limbs, and brace his frame! Then pale with fears, and sick'ning at the sight, They dragg'd the unwilling Irus to the fight; From his blank visage fled the coward blood, And his flesh trembled as aghast he stood: O that such baseness should disgrace the light! O hide it, death, in everlasting night! Eustathius gives us an instance of the deep penetration of some Critics, in their comments upon these words; they have found in them the Philosophy of Pythagoras, and the transmigration of Souls. The verse stands thus in Homer. ??? ??? ???? ???? ???????, ???? ??????, which they imagine is to be understood after this manner; I wish thou hadst never been born! and mayst thou never exist again, or have a second being! To recite such an absurdity, it is to refute it. The verse when literally render'd bears this import; I wish thou wert now dead, or hadst never been born! an imprecation very natural to persons in anger, who seldom give themselves time to speak with profound allusions to Philosophy. (Exclaims Antinous) can a vigorous foe Meanly decline to combat age and woe? But hear me, wretch! if recreant in the fray, That huge bulk yield this ill-contested day, Instant thou sail'st, to Echetus resign'd, The tradition concerning Echetus stands thus: he was King of Epirus, the son of Euchenor and Phlogea; he had a daughter call'd Metopè, or as others affirm Amphissa; she being corrupted by Echmodicus, Echetus put out her eyes, and condemned her to grind pieces of iron made in the resemblance of corn; and told her she should recover her sight when she had ground the iron into flour. He invited Æchmodicus to an entertainment, and cut off the extremities from all parts of his body, and cast them to the dogs; at length being seiz'd with madness, he fed upon his own flesh and dy'd. This History is confirm'd, lib. 4. of Apollonius. ???????? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ???????? ??? ????????? ?? ???????? ????, ?????? ??? ?????? ??????????? ?????. I wonder how this last quotation escap'd the diligence of Eustathius. Dacier affirms, that no mention is made of Echetus by any of the Greek Historians, and therefore she has recourse to another tradition, preserv'd by Eustathius, who tells us, that Echetus was contemporary with Homer, that the Poet had been ill us'd by him, and therefore took this revenge for his inhumanity. A tyrant, fiercest of the tyrant kind, Who casts thy mangled ears and nose a prey To hungry dogs, and lops the man away. While with indignant scorn he sternly spoke, In ev'ry joint the trembling Irus shook; Now front to front each frowning champion stands, And poises high in air his adverse hands. The Chief yet doubts, or to the shades below To fell the Giant at one vengeful blow, Or save his life; and soon his life to save The King resolves, for mercy sways the brave. That instant Irus his huge arm extends, Full on the shoulder the rude weight descends: The sage Ulysses, fearful to disclose The Heroe latent in the man of woes, Check'd half his might: yet rising to the stroke, His jaw-bone dash'd; the crashing jaw-bone broke: Down drop'd he stupid from the stunning wound, His feet extended, quivering beat the ground, His mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood, His teeth all shatter'd rush immix'd with blood. The Peers transported, as outstretch'd he lies, With bursts of laughter rend the vaulted skies: Then dragg'd along, all bleeding from the wound, His length of carcass trailing prints the ground; Rais'd on his feet, again he reels, he falls, 'Till propp'd reclining on the palace walls; Then to his hand a staff the victor gave, And thus with just reproach address'd the slave. There terrible, affright the dogs, and reign A dreaded tyrant o'er the bestial train! But mercy to the poor and stranger show, Lest heav'n in vengeance send some mightier woe. Scornful he spoke, and o'er his shoulder flung The broad-patch'd scrip; the scrip in tatters hung Ill joyn'd, and knotted to a twisted thong. Then turning short, disdain'd a further stay, But to the palace measur'd back the way. There as he rested, gathering in a ring The Peers with smiles addrest their unknown King: Stranger may Jove and all th' aereal pow'rs, With ev'ry blessing crown thy happy hours! Our freedom to thy prowess'd arm we owe From bold intrusion of thy coward foe; The word in the Greek is ??????? ??????? ??????? is a voracious appetite, a stomach that nothing can satisfy: Hesychius thus explains it: ??????? ????????, ????? ????? ??????, ? ????????? ???? ??? ?????. But there is undoubtedly an error in Hesychius; instead of ?????? we should read ??????, that is, meager, or a stomach that appears always unfill'd. The general moral that we are to gather from the behaviour of Ulysses and Irus, is that insolence and boasting are signs of cowardice. Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing To Echetus, the monster of a King. While pleas'd he hears, Antinous bears the food, A kid's well fatted entrails, rich with blood: The bread from canisters of shining mold Amphinomus! and wines that laugh in gold, And oh! (he mildly cries) may heaven display A beam of glory o'er thy future day! Alas the brave too oft is doom'd to bear The gripes of poverty, and stings of care. To whom with thought mature the King replies: The tongue speaks wisely, when the soul is wise; Such was thy father! in imperial state, Great without vice, that oft attends the great: Nor from the sire art thou the son declin'd; Then hear my words, and grave them in thy mind! There never was a finer lecture of Morality read in any of the schools of the Philosophers, than this which Ulysses delivers to Amphinomus; he ushers it in with great solemnity, and speaks to all mankind in the person of Amphinomus. It is quoted by a variety of Authors; Pliny in his Preface to his natural History, lib. 7. has wrote a dissertation on this sentence. Of all that breathes or grov'ling creeps on earth Must vain is Man, &amp;c. Aristotle and Maximus Tyrius quote it; and Plutarch twice refers to it. Homer considers Man both with respect to the errors of the mind, and the calamities incident to the body; and upon a review of all mortal creatures, he attributes to man the unhappy superiority in miseries. But indeed Homer is so plain that he needs no interpretation, and any words but his own must disgrace him. Besides, this speech is beautiful in another view, and excellently sets forth the forgiving temper of Ulysses: He saw that all the sparks of virtue and humanity were not extinguished in Amphinomus; he therefore warns him with great solemnity to forsake the Suitors; he imprints conviction upon his mind, tho' ineffectually, and shews by it that when he falls by the hand of Ulysses in the succeeding parts of the Odyssey, his death is not a revenge but a punishment. Of all that breathes or groveling creeps on earth, Most vain is Man! calamitous by birth. To-day with pow'r elate, in strength he blooms; The haughty creature on that pow'r presumes: Anon from heav'n a sad reverse he feels; Untaught to bear, 'gainst heav'n the wretch rebels. For man is changeful as his bliss or woe, Most of the interpreters have greatly misrepresented these words, ????? ??? ???? ????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ??? ???? ?????. They thus translate it, talis mens hominum, qualem deus suggerit; or, “Such is the mind of man, as Heav'n inspires:” but this is an error, for ???? cannot refer to ????, but to ????, and the sentence is thus to be render'd, Talis mens hominum, qualem diem deus inducit; that is, “The mind of man changes with the complexion of the day, as heaven sends happiness or misery;” or as in the translation, For man is changeful as his bliss or woe, Too high when prosp'rous, when distress'd too low. The Reader will be convinc'd that the construction requires this sense, by joyning the preposition with the verb, ??? with ?????, and rendring it, ???? ???? ???????; nothing being more frequent than such a division of the preposition from the verb amongst the Greeks. It must be allow'd, that Homer gives a very unhappy, yet too just a picture, of human nature: Man is too apt to be proud and insolent in prosperity, and mean and abject in adversity; and those men who are most overbearing in an happy state, are always most base and mean in the day of affliction. Too high when prosp'rous, when distrest too low. There was a day, when with the scornful Great I swell'd in pomp, and arrogance of state; Proud of the pow'r that to high birth belongs; And us'd that pow'r to justify my wrongs. Then let not man be proud: but firm of mind, Bear the best humbly, and the worst resign'd; Be dumb when heav'n afflicts! unlike yon train Of haughty spoilers, insolently vain; Who make their Queen and all her wealth a prey: But Vengeance and Ulysses wing their way. O may'st thou, favour'd by some guardian pow'r, Far, far be distant in that deathful hour? For sure I am, if stern Ulysses breathe, These lawless riots end in blood and death. Then to the Gods the rosy juice he pours, And the drain'd goblet to the Chief restores. Stung to the soul, o'ercast with holy dread, He shook the graceful honours of his head; His boding mind the future woe forestalls, In vain! by great Telemachus he falls, For Pallas seals his doom: All sad he turns To joyn the Peers, resumes his throne, and mourns. Mean-while Minerva with instinctive fires Thy soul, Penelope, from heav'n inspires; With flatt'ring hopes the Suitors to betray, The Greek is very concise, and the expression uncommon, ???? ???????? ????? ?????????; that is, Penelope thus acted that she might dilate the heart of the Suitors; meaning (as Eustathius observes) that she might give them false hopes by appearing in their company; for the heart shrinks and is contracted by sorrow and despair, and is again dilated by hope or joy. This is I believe literally true, the spirits flow briskly when we are in joy, and a new pulse is given to the blood, which necessarily must dilate the heart: On the contrary, when we are in sorrow the spirits are languid, and the blood moves less actively; and therefore the heart shrinks and contracts, the blood wanting vigour to dilate and expand it. And seem to meet, yet fly, the bridal day, Thy husband's wonder, and thy son's, to raise, This is solely the act of Minerva; for Penelope is ignorant that she is to appear before her husband. This interview is excellently managed by Homer: Ulysses is to be convinced of his wife's fidelity; to bring this about, he introduces her upon the public stage, where her husband stands as a common unconcerned spectator, and hears her express her love for him in the warmest terms: here is no room for art or design, because she is ignorant that she speaks before Ulysses; and therefore her words must be suppos'd to proceed from the heart. This gives us a reason why Homer makes her dwell at large upon her passion for Ulysses, and paint it in the strongest colours, viz. to evidence her chastity, and urge Ulysses to hasten the destruction of the Suitors, by convincing him that she is able no longer to delude the marriage hour. But then it may be objected, if Penelope's sole design was to give a false hope to the Suitors, does she not take a very wrong method, by speaking so very tenderly of Ulysses? is not this a more probable reason for despair, than hope? It is true, it would have been so, if in the conclusion of her speech she had not artfully added, But when my son grows man, the royal sway Resign, and happy be thy bridal day! So that Telemachus being now grown up to maturity, the Suitors concluded that the nuptial hour was at hand. If then we consider the whole conduct of Penelope in this book, it must be allow'd to be very refin'd and artful; she observes a due regard towards Ulysses, by shewing she is not to be persuaded to marry; and yet by the same words she gives the Suitors hopes that the day is almost come when she intends to celebrate her nuptials; she manages so dextrously, as to persuade without a promise; and for this reason the words are put into the mouth of Ulysses, and it is Ulysses who gives the hopes, rather than Penelope. And crown the mother and the wife with praise. Then, while the streaming sorrow dims her eyes, Homer gives us a very beautiful and just image in these words. In the Iliad he used a similar expression concerning Andromache, ???????? ????????; a smile chastis'd with tears. ??????? ?? ????????? here bears the same import. Thus with a transient smile the matron cries. Eurynomè! to go where riot reigns I feel an impulse, tho' my soul disdains; To my lov'd son the snares of death to show, And in the traytor friend unmask the foe; Who smooth of tongue, in purpose insincere, Hides fraud in smiles, while death is ambush'd there. Go warn thy son, nor be the warning vain, (Reply'd the sagest of the royal train) But bath'd, anointed, and adorn'd descend; Pow'rful of charms, bid ev'ry grace attend; The tyde of flowing tears a-while suppress; Tears but indulge the sorrow, not repress. Some joy remains: To thee a son is giv'n, I am not certain that this is the exact sense of Homer; Dacier understands him very differently. Eurynome (observes that Author) is not endeavouring to comfort Penelope because her son is now come to years of maturity; her purpose is, to shew the necessity she has to have recourse to art, to assist her beauty: For (adds she) your son is grown a man; meaning that a Lady who has a son twenty years old, must have lost her natural beauty, and has occasion to be obliged to art to give her an artificial one. This I confess is too true, but it seems a little too ludicrous for Epic Poetry; I have follow'd a different sense, that gives us a far nobler image; conformable to that verse of Horace. Quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno, Quam sapere, &amp;c. This agrees with the tenour of Euryclea's speech, and is a foundation of great comfort to Penelope. Such as in fondness parents ask of heav'n. Ah me! forbear, returns the Queen, forbear; Oh! talk not, talk not of vain beauty's care! No more I bathe, since he no longer sees Those charms, for whom alone I wish'd to please. The day that bore Ulysses from this coast, Blasted the little bloom these cheeks could boast. But instant bid Autonoè descend, Instant Hippodamè our steps attend; Ill suits it, female virtue to be seen Alone indecent, in the walks of men. Then while Eurynomè the mandate bears, From heav'n Minerva shoots with guardian cares; O'er all her senses, as the couch she prest, This is an admirable stroke of art, to shew the determin'd resolution of Penelope, to forbear the endeavour of making her person agreeable in any eyes but those of Ulysses: A Goddess is obliged to cast her into an involuntary repose, and to supply an adventitious grace while she sleeps. She pours a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest, With ev'ry beauty ev'ry feature arms, Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms, In her love-darting eyes awakes the fires, (Immortal gifts! to kindle soft Desires) From limb to limb an air majestick sheds, And the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads, Such Venus shines, when with a measur'd bound She smoothly gliding swims th' harmonious round, When with the graces in the dance she moves, And fires the gazing Gods with ardent loves. Then to the skies her flight Minerva bends, We see Penelope is a woman of so much wisdom, as to be the favourite of Minerva. She acts in every point with the highest discretion, and is inconsolable for her husband; yet the Poet forbears to let her into the secret that Ulysses is return'd: This is undoubtedly an intended satyr, and Homer means, that a woman in every point discreet, is still to be suspected of loquacity: This seems to have been the real sentiment of Homer, which he more fully declares in the eleventh Odyssey. When earnest to explore thy secret breast, Unfold some trifle, but conceal the rest; For since of womankind so few are just, Think all are false, nor ev'n the faithful trust. And to the Queen the damsel train descends: Wak'd at their steps, her flowing eyes unclose; The tear she wipes, and thus renews her woes. Howe'er 'tis well! that Sleep a-while can free With soft forgetfulness, a wretch like me; Oh! were it giv'n to yield this transient breath, Send, oh! Diana, send the sleep of death! Why must I waste a tedious life in tears, Nor bury in the silent grave my cares? O my Ulysses! ever honour'd name! For thee I mourn till death dissolves my frame. Thus wailing, slow and sadly she descends, On either hand a damsel train attends: Full where the dome its shining valves expands, Radiant before the gazing Peers she stands; A vail translucent o'er her brow display'd, Her beauty seems, and only seems, to shade: Sudden she lightens in their dazled eyes, And sudden flames in ev'ry bosom rise; They send their eager souls with ev'ry look, 'Till silence thus th' imperial matron broke; O why! my son, why now no more appears That warmth of soul that urg'd thy younger years? Thy riper days no growing worth impart, A man in stature, still a boy in heart! Thy well-knit frame unprofitably strong, Speaks thee an Heroe from an Heroe sprung: But the just Gods in vain those gifts bestow, O wise alone in form, and brave in show! Heav'ns! could a stranger feel oppression's hand Beneath thy roof, and could'st thou tamely stand? If thou the stranger's righteous cause decline, His is the suff'rance, but the shame is thine. To whom with filial awe, the Prince returns: That gen'rous soul with just resentment burns, Yet taught by time, my heart has learn'd to glow For others good, and melt at others woe: But impotent these riots to repel, I bear their outrage, tho' my soul rebel: Helpless amid the snares of death I tread, And numbers leagu'd in impious union dread: But now no crime is theirs: this wrong proceeds Eustathius informs us, that we are here to understand the fray between Irus and Ulysses. Penelope refers to the violence intended to be offer'd to Ulysses, when the footstool was thrown at him by Antinous; we find that she was acquainted with that assault from her speech in the preceding book. In reality, the Queen was ignorant of the combat between Irus and Ulysses; but Telemachus misunderstands her with design, and makes an Apology for the Suitors, fearing to raise a further disorder, or provoke them to some more violent act of resentment. From Irus, and the guilty Irus bleeds. O would to Jove! or her whose arms display The shield of Jove, or him who rules the day! That yon proud Suitors, who licentious tread These courts, within these courts like Irus bled: Whose loose head tottering as with wine opprest, Obliquely drops, and nodding knocks his breast; Pow'rless to move, his stagg'ring feet deny The coward wretch the privilege to fly. Then to the Queen Eurymachus replies: O justly lov'd, and not more fair than wise! Should Greece thro' all her hundred states survey Thy finish'd charms, all Greece would own thy sway, Homer expresses Greece by ????? ????? Iäsian Argos. The word properly (as Eustathius observes) denotes the Morea or Peloponnesus, so call'd from Iäsus the son of Argus, and Io King of that Country; Strabo agrees with Eustathius. Chapman wonderfully mistakes Homer, and explains his own mistake in a paraphrase of six lines. Most wise Icarius' daughter, if all those That did for Colchos vent'rous sail dispose, For that rich purchase; had before but seen Earth's richer prize, in th' Ithacensian Queen, They had not made that voyage; but to you Would all their virtues, all their beings vow. I need not say how foreign this is to the original. In reality Argos with different epithets, signifies different countries; ??????? ????? means Thessaly, and ????? ????? Peloponnesus; but here it denotes Greece universally; for it would appear absurd to tell Penelope, that all the Morea would admire her beauty, this would lessen the compliment; nor is any reason to be asab why Peloponnesus should admire her more than the rest of the Greeks. In rival crouds contest the glorious prize, Dispeopling realms to gaze upon thy eyes: O woman! loveliest of the lovely kind, In body perfect, and compleat in mind! Ah me! returns the Queen, when from this shore Ulysses sail'd, then beauty was no more! The Gods decreed these eyes no more should keep Their wonted grace, but only serve to weep. Should he return, whate'er my beauties prove, My virtues last; my brightest charm is love. Now, Grief, thou all art mine! the Gods o'ercast My soul with woes, that long, ah long must last! Too faithfully my heart retains the day That sadly tore my royal Lord away: He grasp'd my hand, and oh my spouse! I leave Thy arms, (he cry'd) perhaps to find a Grave: Fame speaks the Trojans bold; they boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill, To dart the spear, and guide the rushing car With dreadful inroad thro' the walks of war. My sentence is gone forth, and 'tis decreed Perhaps by righteous heav'n that I must bleed! My father, mother, all, I trust to thee; To them, to them transfer the love of me: But when my son grows man, the royal sway The original says, resign the Palace to Telemachus: this is spoken according to the customs of Antiquity: The wife, upon her second marriage, being obliged to resign the house to the heir of the family. This circumstance is inserted with great judgment: the Suitors were determined to seize it upon marriage with Penelope, as appears from the second Odyssey. What mighty labours would he then create, To seize his treasures, and divide his state, The royal Palace to the Queen convey, Or him she blesses in the bridal day? Penelope therefore by this declaration gives the Suitors to understand, that the Palace belong'd not to her, but Telemachus. This assertion has a double effect; it is intended to make the Suitors less warm in their addresses; or if they persist, to set the injustice done to Telemachus in open view. The beauty of all the speeches of Penelope in this book is so obvious that it needs no explanation; Homer gives a very amiable character, she is good in every relation of life, merciful to the poor and stranger, a tender mother, and an affectionate wife; every period is almost a lecture of morality. My father, mother, all, I trust to thee; To them, to them transfer the love of me. This shews the duty of the child to the parent; it may be extended to all persons to whom we owe any duty; and humanity requires that we should endeavour to ease the burthen of our friends in proportion to their calamities; we should at all times consult their happiness, but chiefly in the hour of adversity. A friend should be a support to lean upon in all our infirmities. Resign, and happy be thy bridal day! Such were his words; and Hymen now prepares To light his torch, and give me up to cares; Th' afflictive hand of wrathful Jove to bear: A wretch the most compleat that breathes the air! Fall'n ev'n below the rights to woman due! Careless to please, with insolence ye wooe! The gen'rous lovers, studious to succeed, Bid their whole herds and flocks in banquets bleed; By precious gifts the vow sincere display: Horace, lib. 2. Sat. 5. makes a very severe reflexion upon Penelope, and in her person (I say not how justly) upon the whole sex; he gives the avarice of the Suitors as the sole reason of Penelope's chastity; and insinuates that women would sell their virtue, if men would be at the expence to buy. Venit enim magnum donandi parca juventus, Nec tantum Veneris, quantum studiosa culinæ. Sic tibi Penelope frugi est: Qua si semel uno De sene gustârit, tecum partita lucellum; Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto. Horace had this passage in view, and imputes the coldness of Penelope to a want of generosity in her admirers. Diodorus assures us, that Venus had a Temple in Æg?pt dedicated to her under the title of ????? ????????; or golden Venus; and it is her usual epithet throughout all Homer. Near Memphis there was an allotment of ground call'd the field of golden Venus: but it ought not to be conceal'd, that some persons believe she bears that name from the golden colour of her hair. Horace, to give his satyr the greater strength, puts the words into the mouth of the prophet Tiresias, a person of unerring veracity. You, only you, make her ye love your prey. Well-pleas'd Ulysses hears his Queen deceive The Suitor-train, and raise a thirst to give: This conduct may appear somewhat extraordinary both in Penelope and Ulysses; she not only takes, but asks presents from persons whom she never intends to marry: Is not this a sign either of avarice or falshood? and is not Ulysses equally guilty, who rejoices at it? But in reality, Penelope is no way faulty; she deceives the Suitors with hopes of marriage by accepting these presents, but it is for this sole reason that she accepts them; she intends to give them false hopes, and by that method to defer the nuptial hour: It is not injustice, but an equitable reprisal; they had violently wasted her treasures, and she artfully recovers part of them by a piece of refin'd management. Dacier defends her after another method: she believes that Penelope thus acts, not out of interest but honour; it was a disgrace to so great a Princess to have so many admirers, and never to receive from their hands such presents as custom not only allows, but commands; neither is Ulysses blameable, who rejoices at his wife's policy. He understood her intent, and being artful himself, smiles to see her artfulness. Plutarch in his treatise of reading Poems, vindicates Ulysses very much in the same way: If (says that Author) Ulysses rejoiced at Penelope's art in drawing presents from the Suitors out of avarice, he discovers himself to be a sordid prostitutor of his wife; but if thro' a wise foresight he hop'd by her acceptance of the presents, to get the Suitors more into his power, by lulling them into security, and laying all their suspicions asleep, thro' a sudden prospect of marriage; if this occasion'd his joy, this joy arising from her artful management, and from a full confidence in his wife, is no way blameable, but proceeds from a sufficient and laudable cause. In short, the Suitors were enemies, and nothing could be practis'd dishonourably against them, that either Ulysses, or Penelope could act consistently with their own honour. False hopes she kindles, but those hopes betray, It is certain that the words in the Greek will bear a double construction, and ??? ?? ????? ?????????? ?????? may refer either to Penelope or Ulysses. Eustathius thinks they are spoken of Ulysses; then the meaning is, that Ulysses comforted himself with her amusing words, while he form'd a design very different from what her words expressed; but Dacier refers them to Penelope, perhaps with better reason: ????? depends upon FA/TO in the preceding line, and by thus understanding it the construction becomes easy and natural: and the sentence means, that Penelope's words flattered the Suitors into hopes of marriage, while her thoughts were very distant from complying with their inclinations: This interpretation best agrees with the general design of Penelope, which was to act an artful part, and neither comply, nor absolutely refuse their addresses. And promise, yet elude the bridal day. While yet she speaks, the gay Antinous cries, Offspring of Kings, and more than woman wise! 'Tis right; 'tis man's prerogative to give, And custom bids thee without shame receive; Yet never, never from thy dome we move, 'Till Hymen lights the torch of spousal love. The Peers dispatch their heralds to convey The gifts of love; with speed they take the way. A robe Antinous gives of shining dyes, The varying hues in gay confusion rise Rich from the artist's hand! twelve clasps of gold Close to the less'ning waist the vest infold; Down from the swelling loins, the vest unbound Floats in bright waves redundant o'er the ground. A bracelet rich with gold, with amber gay, That shot effulgence like the solar ray, Eurymachus presents: and ear-rings bright, With triple stars, that cast a trembling light. Pisander bears a necklace, wrought with art; And ev'ry Peer, expressive of his heart, A gift bestows: This done, the Queen ascends, And slow behind her damsel train attends. Then to the dance they form the vocal strain, 'Till Hesporus leads forth the starry train; And now he raises, as the day-light fades, His golden circlet in the deep'ning shades: Three vases heap'd with copious fires display The word in the Greek is ???????, or a vase which was plac'd upon a tripod, upon which the Antients burnt dry and oftentimes odoriferous wood, to give at once both perfume and light. Eustathius explains it by ?????????, or a vessel rais'd on feet in the nature of an hearth. Hesychius explains ???????, an hearth placed in the middle of the house or hall, on which they burnt dry wood with intermingled torches to enlighten it. It is strange that there is no mention of lamps, but only torches, in Homer; undoubtedly lamps were not in use in Greece, although much earlier found out by the Hebrews: Thus Exod. xxv. 6. oil is mentioned, and injoin'd to be used in giving light to the sanctuary. O'er all the palace a fictitious day; From space to space the torch wide-beaming burns, And sprightly damsels trim the rays by turns. To whom the King: Ill suits your sex to stay Homer is perpetually giving us lessons of decency and morality. It may be thought that this interlude between Ulysses and the damsels of Penelope is foreign to the action of the Odyssey; but in reality it is far from it: the Poet undertook to describe the disorders which the absence of a Prince occasions in his family; this passage is an instance of it; and Homer with good judgment makes these wantons declare their contempt of Ulysses, and their favour to their Suitors, that we may acknowledge the justice of their punishment in the subsequent parts of the Odyssey. Alone with men! ye modest maids, away! Go, with the Queen the spindle guide or cull (The partners of her cares) the silver wool; Be it my task the torches to supply Ev'n till the morning lamp adorns the sky; Ev'n till the morning, with unwearied care, Sleepless I watch; for I have learn'd to bear. Scornful they heard: Melantho, fair and young, (Melantho, from the loins of Dolius sprung, Who with the Queen her years an infant led, With the soft fondness of a daughter bred) Chiefly derides: regardless of the cares Her Queen endures, polluted joys she shares Nocturnal with Eurymachus: With eyes That speak disdain, the wanton thus replies. Oh! whether wanders thy distemper'd brain, Thou bold intruder on a princely train? Hence to the vagrant's rendezvous repair; I flatter my self that I have given the true sense of ???????? ?????, and ?????. In Greece the beggars in winter retir'd by night to public forges for their warmth, or to some rendezvous where they entertain'd themselves as it were in a common assembly. Eustathius explains ????? to be a public place without any doors, where beggars were used to lodge. Hesychius gives us several interpretations of the word that it signifies an assembly, a conversation; it implies also public stoves or baths; and Eustathius informs us from Aristophanes, that beggars used to take up their lodgings in the public baths, as well as in these places mentioned by Homer; ???????? ????? is an office of men that work in brass. He further observes that these two places are used after the same manner in Hesiod. ??? ?? ??? ???????? ?????, ??? ??? ????? ?????? )/??? ????????, ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ???????. ? It may not be improper to observe, that ??? ?? ??? ????? ???????? is very ill translated by Accede Æneam sedem in the Latin version; it should be fuge officinam Ærariam. Or shun in some black forge the midnight air. Proceeds this boldness from a turn of soul, Or flows licentious from the copious bowl? Is it that vanquish'd Irus swells thy mind? The word in Homer is ?????, which is used in various places; sometimes (observes Plutarch in his treatise upon reading Poems) it signifies being disquieted in mind, ?? ?????. ? ??????? ?????????, ??????? ?? ?????. In other places it implies an insolent joy, or boasting; and then he quotes this verse, ? ????? ??? ???? ????????.. A foe may meet thee of a braver kind, Who shortning with a storm of blows thy stay, Shall send thee howling all in blood away! To whom with frowns: O impudent in wrong! Thy Lord shall curb that insolence of tongue; Know to Telemachus I tell th' offence: The scourge, the scourge shall lash thee into sense. With conscious shame they hear the stern rebuke, Nor longer durst sustain the sovereign look. Then to the servile task the Monarch turns His royal hands; Each torch refulgent burns With added day: mean-while in museful mood, Absorpt in thought, on vengeance fix'd he stood. And now the Martial Maid, by deeper wrongs It may be thought very unjustifiable in Homer, to introduce Minerva exciting the Suitors to violence. Dacier defends the Poet, by shewing that the sentiment is conformable to true Theology: and the all-wise Author of our being is pleas'd sometimes to harden the hearts of the wicked, (or rather to permit them to harden their own hearts) that they may fill up the measure of their crimes, and be ripe for judgment: Yet we are not to imagine, that any person is necessitated to be wicked: It is not the hardening the heart that originally makes men impious, but they are first impious, and then they are delivered over to an hardness of heart. But Homer may be justify'd another way; and Minerva may be understood to act thus in favour of Ulysses: The Goddess of Wisdom infatuates the Suitors to insult that Heroe, and hasten their own destruction. To rouze Ulysses, points the Suitors' tongues: Scornful of age, to taunt the virtuous man, Thoughtless and gay, Eurymachus began. Hear me (he cries) confederates and friends! Some God no doubt this stranger kindly sends; Aristotle affirms that Homer is the father of Poetry; not only of the Epic, but also of the Dramatick; that he taught how to write Tragedy in the Iliad, and Comedy by several short sketches in the Odyssey. Eustathius here remarks, that he likewise gave a model for Satyr, of which the Cyclops of Euripides, still extant, is an example; (which is a satyric Poem founded upon the story of Polypheme in Homer.) I confess my eye is not sharp enough to see the dignity of these railleries; and it may be thought that Homer is the father of another kind of Poetry, I mean the Farce, and that these low conceits are no way to be justify'd, but by being put into the mouths of the Suitors, persons of no dignity or character. Longinus brings such descriptions of the Suitors, as instances of the decay of Homer's genius. When that declines (observes that Author) Poets commonly please themselves with painting Manners; such is Homer's description of the lives led by the Suitors in the Palace of Ulysses: for in reality all that description is a kind of Comedy, wherein the different characters of men are painted. The shining baldness of his head survey, This in Dacier's judgment is a raillery purely satyrical; it is drawn from the shining glass of an old man's bald head. But if this be purely satyrical, to be a satyrist is to be a bad man: To rally natural infirmities is inhumanity: Old age is venerable, and the bald head as well as the gray hair is an honour, and ought not to be the subject of raillery. I doubt not but Homer put it into the mouth of Eurymachus to make him more odious, and to shew us that the same man who invades his Prince's property, insults the stranger, and outrages the poor, pays no deference to old age, but is base enough to contemn what he ought to honour. Vice and folly are the province of Satyr, not human infirmity. It aids our torch-light, and reflects the ray. Then to the King that levell'd haughty Troy. Say, if large hire can tempt thee to employ Those hands in work? to tend the rural trade, To dress the walk, and form th' embow'ring shade. So food and rayment constant will I give: But idly thus thy soul prefers to live, And starve by strolling, not by work to thrive. To whom incens'd: Should we, O Prince, engage In rival tasks beneath the burning rage Of summer suns, were both constrain'd to wield I doubt not but such employments as these, now only suitable to low life, will seem mean to many Readers, and unworthy of the dignity of Epic Poetry: It is no defence to say that they are mention'd by a beggar, and therefore agreeable to his character: The words are address'd to a Prince, and suppose that a skill in such works was not unusual to persons of eminent stations; otherwise the challenge of Ulysses is ridiculously absurd. Who could forbear laughing, if he should hear one of our beggars challenge a Peer, to plow or mow with him all day without eating? The truth is, the greatest persons follow'd such employments without any diminution of their dignities; nay, a skill in such works as Agriculture was a glory even to a King: Homer here places it upon a level with military science, and the knowledge of the cultivation of the ground is equall'd to glory in war. In the preface to the Pastorals of Virgil (but not written by Mr. Dryden) there is a passage that shews that the same simplicity of manners prevail'd amongst the Antient Latins, as amongst the Antient Greeks: It ought not (says that Author) to surprize a modern writer, that Kings laid down their first rudiments of government in tending their mute subjects, their herds and flocks: Nor ought it to seem strange that the master of the horse to King Latinus in the ninth Æneid was found in the homely employment of cleaving blocks, when news of the first skirmish between the Trojans and Latins was brought to him.” This passage fully vindicates Homer, and shews that such employments were no dishonour to the greatest persons; but there are two errors in the quotation; it is not taken from the ninth, but the seventh Æneid; nor is Tyrrheus, who cleaves the blocks, master of the horse to King Latinus, but the intendant of his flocks; or as Dryden translates it, Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian King. ? Tyrrheusque pater, cui regia parent Armenta, &amp; latè custodia creaita campi. Tyrrheus is no otherwise a warrior, than as a deer under his charge, being kill'd, engages him in a quarrel, and he arms the rustics to encounter the Trojans who slew it. ? vocat agmina Tyrrheus Quadrifidem quercum cuneis ut forte coactis Scindebat ? Tyrrheus, the foster-father of the beast, Then clench'd an hatchet in his horny fist; But held his hand from the descending stroke, And left his wedge within the cloven oak. 'Tis true, tho' Tyrrheus was not master of the horse to the King, yet his office was a post of dignity, otherwise it had been very easy for Virgil to have given him a more noble employment. Foodless, the scythe along the burthen'd field; Or should we labour while the plowshare wounds With steers of equal strength, the allotted grounds; Beneath my labours how thy wond'ring eyes Might see the sable field at once arise! Should Jove dire war unloose, with spear and shield And nodding helm, I tread th' ensanguin'd field, Fierce in the van: Then wou'dst thou, wou'dst thou say, Misname me glutton in that glorious day? No, thy ill-judging thoughts the brave disgrace; 'Tis thou injurious art, not I am base. Proud, to seem brave among a coward train! But know thou art not valorous, but vain. Gods! should the stern Ulysses rise in might, These gates would seem too narrow for thy flight. While yet he speaks, Eurymachus replies, With indignation flashing from his eyes. Slave, I with justice might deserve the wrong, Should I not punish that opprobrious tongue; Irreverent to the Great, and uncontroul'd, Art thou from wine, or innate folly, bold? Perhaps, these outrages from Irus flow, A worthless triumph o'er a worthless foe! He said, and with full force a footstool threw: Whirl'd from his arm with erring rage it flew; Ulysses, cautious of the vengeful foe, Stoops to the ground, and disappoints the blow. Not so a youth who deals the goblet round, Full on his shoulder it inflicts a wound, Dash'd from his hand the sounding goblet flies, He shrieks, he reels, he falls, and breathless lies. Then wild uproar and clamour mounts the sky, 'Till mutual thus the Peers indignant cry; O had this stranger sunk to realms beneath, To the black realms of darkness and of death, Ere yet he trod these shores! to strife he draws Peer against Peer; and what the weighty cause? A vagabond! for him the great destroy In vile ignoble jars, the feast of joy. To whom the stern Telemachus uprose! Gods! what wild folly from the goblet flows? Whence this unguarded openness of soul, But from the licence of the copious bowl? Or heav'n delusion sends. But hence, away! Force I forbear, and without force obey. This is very artful in Telemachus; he had spoken warmly in defence of Ulysses, and he apprehends lest he should have provoked the Suitors too far; he therefore softens his expression, to avoid suspicions of a latent cause, why he interests himself so vigorously in vindication of a beggar, against the Princes of the country. Besides, too obstinate an opposition might have provoked the Suitors to have continued all night in the Palace, which would have hinder'd Ulysses and Telemachus from concerting their measures to bring about their destruction: Telemachus therefore to induce them to withdraw uses menaces, but menaces approaching to persuasion; if he had used violence, matters must immediately have come to extremities. Silent, abash'd, they hear the stern rebuke, 'Till thus Amphinomus the silence broke. True are his words, and he whom truth offends Not with Telemachus, but truth contends; Let not the hand of violence invade The rev'rend stranger, or the spotless maid; Retire we hence! but crown with rosy wine The flowing goblet to the pow'rs divine; Guard he his guest beneath whose roof he stands: This justice, this the social right demands. The Peers assent; the goblet Mulius crown'd With purple juice, and bore in order round; Each Peer successive his libation pours We have already observed that libations were made to the Gods before and after meals; here we see the Suitors offer their libation before they retire to repose. We are not to ascribe this religious act to the piety of these debauchees, but to the customs of the times; they practise not true religion, but only the exteriors of it; they are not pious, but fashionable. The action of this book is comprehended in a very short duration of time; it begins towards the close of the day, and ends at the time when the Suitors withdraw to repose; this is the evening and part of the night of the thirty-ninth day. In general, this book is in the Greek very beautiful: The combat between Irus and Ulysses is naturally described; it is indeed between beggars, but yet not without dignity, it being almost of the same nature with the single combats practis'd amongst Heroes in their most solemn games; as is evident from that in the Iliad, at the funeral of Patroclus. I could wish Homer had not condescended to those low jests and mean railleries towards the conclusion: 'Tis true, they are not without effect, as they agree with the characters of the Suitors, and make Ulysses a spectator of the disorders of his own family, and provoke him to a speedy vengeance: But might not more serious provocations have been found out, such as might become the gravity and majesty of Epic Poetry? or if gaiety was essential to his characters, are quibbles so too? These may be thought to be of the same level with Those conceits which Milton puts into the mouth of the Devil, and which disgrace his Poem. But the dignity, the tenderness, and justness of the sentiments, in all the speeches of Penelope, more than atone for the low railleries of Eurymachus. To the blest Gods that fill th'aereal bow'rs; Then swill'd with wine, with noise the crowds obey, And rushing forth tumultuous reel away. THE NINTEENTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Discovery of Ulysses to Euryclea. Ulysses and his son remove the weapons out of the Armory. Ulysses in conversation with Penelope gives a fictitious account of his adventures; then assures her he had formerly entertain'd her husband in Crete; and describes exactly his person and dress, affirms to have heard of him in Phæacia and Thesprotia, and that his return is certain, and within a month. He then goes to bathe, and is attended by Euryclea, who discovers him to be Ulysses by the scar upon his leg, which he formerly received in hunting the wild boar on Parnassus. The Poet inserts a digression, relating that accident, with all its particulars. The Scene still continues in the Palace of Ulysses; but new persons are introduced to carry on the action, and diversify the story; This book opens with a repetition from the sixteenth; the Ancients mark'd it with an Asterism, without any Obelisk, to shew that it was here inserted with propriety: As we draw nearer to the conclusion of the Poem, the repetitions are more frequent. Virgil has generally avoided them, and indeed it may be observed, that these two Poets differ in nothing more than the manner of their elocution: Virgil is full, but Homer even overflows; and this agrees with their general characters. Homer is like those Painters of whom Apelles used to complain, that they left nothing to be imagin'd by the spectator, and made too accurate representations; but Virgil is like Timantes in Pliny. Timanti plurimum adfuit ingenii, in omnibus operibus ejus intelligitur plus semper quam pingitur and again, ostendit etiam quæ occultat. Eustathius observes, that the unexpected opportunity to remove the arms in the absence of the Suitors, occasions this repetition; In the sixteenth book Ulysses told Telemachus he would give a sign when he should make the removal, despairing of an opportunity to give a publick direction, without danger from the Suitors; he therefore wisely lays hold of the present hour which happily favours his desires, and injoins the arms to be remov'd immediately. Consulting secret with the blue-ey'd Maid, Still in the dome divine Ulysses stay'd: Revenge mature for act inflam'd his breast; And thus the Son the fervent Sire addrest. Instant convey those steely stores of war To distant rooms, dispos'd with secret care: The cause demanded by the Suitor-train, To sooth their fears a specious reason feign: Say, since Ulysses left his natal coast, Obscene with smoke, their beamy lustre lost, His arms deform'd, the roof they won't adorn: From the glad walls inglorious lumber torn. Suggest, that Jove the peaceful thought inspir'd, Lest they by sight of swords to fury fir'd, Dishonest wounds, or violence of soul, Defame the bridal feast, and friendly bowl. The Prince obedient to the sage command, To Euryclea thus: The female band It is not without sufficient reason that Telemachus distrusts the maids; many of them were in the interest of the Suitors: it was therefore necessary to conceal the place to which the arms were convey'd, lest they should betray the secret. Eustathius. In their apartments keep; secure the doors: These swarthy arms among the covert stores Are seemlier hid; my thoughtless youth they blame, Imbrown'd with vapor of the smould'ring flame. In happy hour, (pleas'd Euryclea cries) Tutor'd by early woes, grow early wise! Inspect with sharpen'd sight, and frugal care, Your patrimonial wealth, a prudent heir. But who the lighted taper will provide, (The female train retir'd,) your toils to guide? Without infringing hospitable right, This guest (he cry'd) shall bear the guiding light: I cheer no lazy vagrants with repast; They share the meal that earn it ere they taste. He said; from female ken she strait secures The purpos'd deed, and guards the bolted doors: Auxiliar to his son, Ulysses bears The plumy-crested helms, and pointed spears With shields indented deep in glorious wars. Minerva viewless on her charge attends, The office here ascrib'd to Minerva gave great offence to Rapin, and he censur'd it as mean, and unworthy of the Goddess; but Eustathius fully vindicates Homer; Pallas is here an allegorical Deity intended by the Poet to express the wisdom of Ulysses; he acts with as much prudence as if Minerva herself guided him in all his ways. We are to gather from this description, that Ulysses form'd all the actions of this night with the utmost wisdom, or according to the Greek proverb, ?? ????? ?????, the counsels of this night were regulated with the exactest prudence and secresy. Spondanus observes, that Callimachus, a statuary in Athens, made an image of Minerva according to this picture in Homer: She held a lamp of gold, which was fill'd with an oil of such an unwasting nature, as not to want to be replenished in the space of a whole year. See lib. 1. of Pausanias. Dacier judges, that tho' a lamp was unknown in the days of Ulysses, yet it might not be so in the days of Homer, and therefore he might speak of it; for instance, the trumpet was not known in the Trojan war, yet Homer mentions it, because it was used in his age. But this is no answer; for Homer does not say that the trumpet was used during the siege of Troy; if he had, he would have been guilty of a gross Anachronism, but he speaks of it by way of allusion, as a thing well known in his time. Here therefore the case is different, for Ulysses is the person who is suppos'd to make use of this lamp, and Dacier allows that it was unknown in his age, and consequently he ought not to use it at all. It may therefore perhaps be most probable, that Callimachus did not form his statue from this original; or if this be not allowed, that he fell into an error, and gave the Goddess a lamp instead of a torch. I will only further add, that this office of Minerva may be vindicated from all meanness, by observing that it is not the bare act of carrying the torch which the Goddess here executes; she improves it into a Miracle; the whole Palace is enlighten'd with a celestial fire, and Ulysses and Telemachus gather full assurances of her favour and success from that miraculous illumination: this circumstance raises the description out of lowness into dignity. And with her golden lamp his toil befriends: Not such the sickly beams, which unsincere, Gild the gross vapor of this nether sphere! A present Deity the Prince confess'd, And rap'd with ecstacy the Sire address'd. What miracle thus dazzles with surprize! Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise: The walls where-e'er my wond'ring sight I turn, And rooss, amidst a blaze of glory burn! Some visitant of pure etherial race, Eustathius gives us a twofold explication of the words, ???? ??? ???? ???? ???? ? They imply either that the Goddess Themis descended; or that it is the custom of celestial powers to manifest themselves in such illuminations, without appearing visibly. The latter interpretation seems most natural, and makes the construction easy, whereas the other is scarce to be understood without supplying ??? before ????: otherwise it must be allow'd, that the former opinion is not unhappy: Ulysses tells his son, that the Goddess of justice is sent by the Gods to assist him in taking vengeance on the Suitors: Themis is a very proper Deity to be introduc'd upon such an occasion, and shews that Ulysses proceeded upon the strictest rules of equity, in the distribution of his rewards and punishments. But the passage will not admit this sense, it being evidently Pallas, not Themis, who appears. With his bright presence deigns the dome to grace. Be calm, replies the Sire; to none impart, But oft revolve the vision in thy heart: Celestials, mantl'd in excess of light, Can visit unapproach'd by mortal sight. Seek thou repose; whilst here I sole remain, T'explore the conduct of the female train: The pensive Queen perchance desires to know The series of my toils, to sooth her woe. With tapers flaming day his train attends, His bright alcove th' obsequious youth ascends: Soft slumb'rous shades his drooping eye-lids close, 'Till on her eastern throne Aurora glows. Whilst, forming plans of death, Ulysses stay'd, In council secret with the Martial Maid; Attendent Nymphs in beauteous order wait The Queen, descending from her bow'r of state. Her cheeks the warmer blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air. An ivory seat with silver ringlets grac'd, By fam'd Icmalius wrought, the menials plac'd: Homer in both his Poems takes all opportunities of celebrating the famous artisans of Antiquity: I doubt not but most of them were his particular friends, and to do them honour, he gave them place in his works, and render'd their names and his own gratitude immortal. We may likewise learn the nature of the noblest pieces of art in Homer's days, from his Poetry. With ivory silver'd thick the foot-stool shone, O'er which the panther's various hide was thrown. The sovereign seat with graceful air she press'd; To different tasks their toil the Nymphs address'd: The golden goblets some, and some restor'd From stains of luxury the polish'd board: These to remove th' expiring embers came, While those with unctuous fir foment the flame. 'Twas then Melantho with imperious mien Renew'd th' attack, incontinent of spleen: Avaunt, she cry'd, offensive to my sight! Deem not in ambush here to lurk by night, Into the woman-state asquint to pry; This is the true reason why Melantho is out of humour (says Madam Dacier:) She had some affairs upon her hands, which demanded no witnesses, meaning the vicious commerce between her and Eurymachus. Women never forgive their own sex a frailty. Dacier is undoubtedly in an error; Eurymachus in the end of the last book left the Palace, and therefore Melantho could not speak out of any apprehensions of having a stop put to her affairs this night, by the presence of Ulysses. A day-devourer, and an ev'ning-spy! Vagrant begone! before this blazing brand Shall urge—and wav'd it hissing in her hand. Th' insulted Heroe rouls his wrathful eyes, And, Why, so turbulent of soul? he cries; Can these lean shrivel'd limbs unnerv'd with age, These poor but honest rags, enkindle rage? In crowds we wear the badge of hungry Fate, And beg, degraded from superior state! Constrain'd! a rent-charge on the rich I live; Reduc'd to crave the good I once could give: A Palace, wealth, and slaves, I late possess'd, And all that makes the Great be call'd the bless'd: My gate, an emblem of my open soul, Embrac'd the poor, and dealt a bounteous dole. Scorn not the sad reverse, injurious maid! 'Tis Jove's high will, and be his will obey'd! Nor think thy self exempt: that rosy prime Must share the general doom of with'ring time: To some new channel soon, the changeful tide Of royal grace th' offended Queen may guide; And her lov'd Lord unplume thy tow'ring pride. Or were he dead, 'tis wisdom to beware: Sweet blooms the Prince beneath Apollo's care; It may be ask'd why Telemachus is said to owe the preservation of his life to Apollo? Eustathius answers, that he was call'd ? ???? ??????????? by Antiquity; and that Daphne from being his favourite was named ???????????: But perhaps that epithet was appropriated to Apollo, because all immature deaths in the male sex were ascribed to him, as they were to Diana in the female; it may therefore be said with great propriety that it is owing to the favour of Apollo, that Telemachus had not died an immature death, or that he was arriv'd to manhood: Eustathius adds, that Apollo, as he is the Sun, may be called the nourisher of all things that breathe, as well as of the inanimate creation; it is owing to his influence that every being comes to maturity, and in this sense likewise he may be called ???????????. What Eustathius ascribes to Daphne, Dacier applies to Diana, and tells us, that she was called ???????????, and that the Antients celebrated a festival in her honour for the health of their infants. Your deeds with quick impartial eye surveys; Potent to punish what he cannot praise. Her keen reproach had reach'd the Sov'reign's ear; Loquacious insolent! Were this place to be render'd literally, it would be thus, Thou bold impudent bitch; ????????? ???? ??????. It is spoken by Penelope. In our age it is an expression so vulgar, as not to be uttered in common conversation, much less in Epic Poetry: 'Tis true, it fully expresses the height of impudence, and in Homer's time it was no more mean, than calling a coward a deer, and both the expressions are joined together in the first of the Iliad. Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer. It is there spoken by Achilles: and in another place of the Iliad Jupiter applies it to his wife, and calls Juno an impudent bitch: a plain indication that the expression was not mean, as it is at this day, because it was used by the greatest of Heroes, and the supreme of Gods. she cries, forbear: To thee the purpose of my soul I told, Venial discourse unblam'd with him to hold. The storied labours of my wand'ring Lord, To sooth my grief, he haply may record: Yet him, my guest, thy venom'd rage hath stung; Thy head shall pay the forfeit of thy tongue! The expression in the Greek is remarkable. ? ? ?? ?????? ?????????. which you shall wipe upon your own head, or as Eustathius explains it, “a crime which you shall make to cleave to your own head:” a similar expression (adds the same Author) occurs in Sophocles. ? ???? ?????????? ???? ??????? ????????. From whence it appears, that the blood that was found upon the sword was wip'd upon the head of the slain; an intimation that his own blood was fallen upon the head of the deceas'd, and the living were free from it. This is a very remarkable custom, and there are many expressions like it in the scriptures; namely his blood be upon his own head. It was customary amongst the Romans to wash their hands, in token of innocence and purity from blood: Thus the Roman Governor wash'd his hands, and said, I am innocent of the blood of this just person. But thou on whom my palace-cares depend, Eurynomè, regard the stranger friend: A seat soft spread with furry spoils prepare, Due-distant for us both to speak, and hear. The menial Fair obeys with duteous haste: A seat adorn'd with furry spoils she plac'd: Due-distant for discourse the Heroe sate; When thus the Sov'reign from her chair of state: Reveal, obsequious to my first demand, Thy name, thy lineage, and thy natal land. He thus: O Queen! whose far-resounding fame, Is bounded only by the starry frame: Consummate pattern of imperial sway, Homer here gives an amiable picture of a mild and just Government: It is a truth certain and universal, where the subject enjoys the fruits of his industry, the earth will always be well cultivated, and bring forth in abundance; the sea will furnish the land with plenty of fishes, and men will plant when they are sure to gather the fruits. It is the constant observation of all travellers, that the worst situation under an easy government enjoys more plenty, and is fuller of inhabitants, than the best soil and happiest situation under an arbitrary power. This whole passage is very beautiful, and the more beautiful because the words proceed from the mouth of a King. Whose pious rule a warlike race obey! In wavy gold thy summer vales are dress'd; Thy autumns bend with copious fruit oppress'd: With flocks and herds each grassy plain is stor'd; And fish of ev'ry fin thy seas afford: Their affluent joys the grateful realms confess; And bless the Pow'r that still delights to bless. Gracious permit this pray'r, imperial Dame! Forbear to know my lineage, or my name: Urge not this breast to heave, these eyes to weep; In sweet oblivion let my sorrow sleep! My woes awak'd will violate your ear; And to this gay censorious train, appear A winy vapour melting in a tear. Their gifts the Gods resum'd (the Queen rejoin'd.) Exterior grace, and energy of mind; When the dear partner of my nuptial joy, Auxiliar troops combin'd, to conquer Troy. My Lord's protecting hand alone wou'd raise My drooping verdure, and extend my praise! Peers from the distant Samian shore resort; Here with Dulichians join'd, besiege the Court: Zacynthus, green with ever-shady groves, And Ithaca, presumptuous boast their loves: Obtruding on my choice a second Lord, They press the Hymenæan rite abhorr'd. Mis-rule thus mingling with domestic cares, I live regardless of my state-affairs: Receive no stranger-guest, no poor relieve; But ever for my Lord in secret grive!— This art, instinct by some cœlestial pow'r, I try'd, elusive of the bridal hour: “Ye Peers, I cry, who press to gain a heart, “Where dead Ulysses claims no future part; “Rebate your loves, each rival suit suspend, “'Till this funereal web my labours end: “Cease, till to good Laertes I bequeath “A pall of state, the ornament of death. “For when to Fate he bows, each Grecian dame “With just reproach were licens'd to defame; “Shou'd He, long honour'd in supreme command, “Want the last duties of a daughter's hand. The fiction pleas'd! their loves I long elude; The night still ravell'd, what the day renew'd, Three years successful in my art conceal'd, My ineffectual fraud the fourth reveal'd: Befriended by my own domestic spies, The woof unwrought the Suitor-train surprize. From nuptial rites they now no more recede, And fear forbids to falsify the brede. My anxious parents urge a speedy choice, And to their suffrage gain the filial voice: For Rule mature, Telemachus deplores His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores— But stranger! as thy days seem full of fate, Divide discourse, in turn thy birth relate: Thy Port asserts thee of distinguish'd race; No poor un-father'd product of disgrace. Princess! he cries, renew'd by your command, The dear remembrance of my native land, Of secret grief unseals the fruitful source; And tears repeat their long-forgotten course! So pays the wretch, whom fate constrains to roam, The dues of nature to his natal home!— But inward on my soul let sorrow prey; Your sovereign Will my duty bids obey. Crete It it not without a good reason that Ulysses is so particular in the Geography of Crete; he does it, that Penelope from the knowledge of the truth which he speaks concerning that Island, may be induc'd to give the readier credit to his succeeding fictions. In the Iliad, Homer calls Crete ???????????, or the Island with an hundred cities, lib. 2. Crete's hundred cities pour forth all her sons. Here he affirms it to have no more than ninety. Strabo is very full upon this difficulty, lib. 10. Ephorus (says that Author) judges that ten cities were built by the Dorians after the Trojan war, under Althæmenes; and therefore Ulysses here mentions Crete as having only ninety: But this opinion carries no probability. Others affirm, that ten cities were demolished by the enemies of Idomeneus, but this is no more than a conjecture: The truth is, Homer does not affirm that there were an hundred cities in the time of the war with Troy, but in his own age; for the Poet in that place speaks in his own person) if he had put the words into the mouth of any one who had liv'd in the time of the war, he would not have called it the Isle of the hundred, but ninety cities, according to this description of Ulysses; it being very improbable, that ten of the Cretan cities should be destroy'd, either during the war, or after the return of Idomeneus; for Homer himself testifies that he return'd safe to Crete with all his soldiers, lib. 3. of the Odyssey. And those whom Idomen from Ilion's plain Had led, securely crost the dreadful main. And therefore he had sufficient forces to defend his country: But tho' we allow that those ten cities had been destroy'd after his return, yet how could Ulysses come to the knowledge of it, having neither been in Crete, nor met with any Cretan to inform him in all his voyages? It is therefore probable that in the time of the Trojan war Crete had no more than ninety cities, but an hundred in the days of Homer: and this fully reconciles the Iliad with the Odyssey; in the Odyssey it is Ulysses that speaks, in the Iliad, Homer. Virgil speaks of Crete after the manner of Homer. Creta Jovis magni medio jacet insula ponto Centum urbes habitant magnas, uberrima regna. The other ten cities were built by the Dorians (as Ephorus writes) under Althæmenes. awes the circling waves, a fruitful soil! And ninety cities crown the sea-born Isle: Mix'd with her genuine sons, adopted names In various tongues avow their various claims: The meaning of this is, that the natural inhabitants of Crete were mix'd with strangers who had settled in the Island; or as some imagine (says Eustathius) Ulysses speaks thus out of fear, lest Penelope should discover him not to be a native of Crete from his wrong pronunciation of the language of the Cretans. We may gather from Strabo, that the Dorians inhabited the eastern parts, the Cydonians the western, the Eteo-Cretans the southern, and the rest of the nation being most powerful, possest the plain country lying toward the north: The Eteo-Cretans, that is, the true Cretans, were the original inhabitants of the Island, and probably also the Cydonians. There is some difficulty in the word ?????????. Andron the Historian (continues Strabo) affirms, that the Dorians who lived near Parnassus planted a colony in Crete, and built three cities, and from thence call'd themselves ?????????, quasi tripartiti. But Strabo rejects this opinion of Andron, for these Dorians possess'd four cities, and their country was called ??????????; he therefore believes them to have taken that name from a triple crest, or from having them adorned with hair after the manner of a plumage, from ?????? signifying hair. But perhaps Strabo is in a mistake, for Thucydides, lib. 1. p. 107. and Diodorus, lib. 11. pag. 60. confirm the opinion of Andron. The words of Strabo have given great trouble to the Commentators, and they ingeniously confess they cannot understand them. The expression is ????????? ?????? ?????????: The difficulty lies in ?????????; but if we read the sentence thus, all will be plain, ????????? ??????, ? ??????????, that is, crests adorn'd with hair, or something like it, from ?????????, æqualis. Dacier. Cydonians, dreadful with the bended yew, And bold Pelasgi boast a native's due: The Dorians, plum'd amid the files of war, Her foodful glebe with fierce Achaians share; Cnossus, her capital of high command; Where sceptred Minos with impartial hand Divided Right; each ninth revolving year This Minos, King of Crete, was an excellent lawgiver; and as Ephorus writes, (says Strabo) to give his laws the greater veneration he used to descend into a cave sacred to Jupiter, and pretend that he had there received them from the mouth of that Deity; this is the reason why Homer tells us he convers'd with Jupiter. Thus also Numa Pompilius boasted of the same favour from Ægeria, to make his decrees to be received by the Romans. The only difficulty is in the word ????????; and it has been generally believed to imply, that Minos continued in the cave of Jupiter nine whole years: but Casaubon remarks, that it never signifies nine years, but every ninth year; as ???????? does not mean three days, but the third day: and this agrees exactly with the History of Minos, (see Valerius Maximus, lib. 1. cap. 2.) who was accustomed to review and rectify all his laws every ninth year. Plato quotes this passage in his piece, entitled Minos, and puts this last observation beyond all dispute: “Homer tells us (says that Author) that Minos convers'd with Jupiter every ninth year, ????? ????, and went to be instructed by him as a scholar by a master;” and a little lower be adds, ?????? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ? ?????, &amp;c. that is, “he went into the cave of Jupiter, to learn new laws, or to reform the old which he had received in the former period,” ?? ??????? ???????????. This Minos was the most just of all mankind, and for this reason was suppos'd to be made one of the infernal judges. Plutarch in the life of Demetrius makes a fine remark upon this description of Minos; “Homer (says he) has not honour'd with the glorious title of the Disciple of Jupiter, the greatest warrior or oppressor, or a renown'd tyrant; but the man famous for his justice and probity, a legislator, and a benefactor to mankind. Dacier. By Jove receiv'd, in council to confer. The word in the Greek is ????????, and Plato fully explains it in his Minos; ????? is the discourse, ???????? the person who discourses; ? ???????????? ?? ??????: others (continues Plato) understand it to signify the guest of Jupiter, ????????, ??????????, a person that was admitted to the table of Jupiter, or a partaker in his diversions; but the falsity of this opinion (adds he) will sufficiently appear, if we remember, that of all the Greeks, the Cretans and Lacedæmonians who learn'd it from them, alone abstain from compotations, and diversions arising from them; and in particular this is one of the laws of Minos enacted in Crete, ?? ????????? ???????? ??? ?????, commanding the Cretans not to drink in their entertainments to excess. Thus far Dacier; to which I shall add that this remark of Plato may perhaps contribute greatly to the glory of Minos, but gives little honour to Jupiter; it insinuates that a person who drinks with that Deity, might endanger his sobriety; otherwise to be admitted to the table of Jupiter is an instance of favour and familiarity, and would have been an honour to Minos. Horace is of this opinion, for speaking of Tantalus, lib. 1 Carm. he mentions it as a peculiar testimony of favour; Occidit &amp; Pelopis genitor, conviva deorum. That is, according to Homer's expression, ???? ???????????? or ????????. His son Deucalion bore successive sway; His son, who gave me first to view the day! The royal bed an elder issue blest, Idomeneus, whom Ilian fields attest Of matchless deed: untrain'd to martial toil I liv'd inglorious in my native Isle, Studious of my peace; and Æthon is my name. 'Twas then to Crete the great Ulysses came; For elemental war, and wintry Jove, From Malea's gusty cape his navy drove To bright Lucina's fane; the shelfy coast Strabo informs us, that upon the Amnissus there is a cave sacred to Ilythia, or Lucina, who presides over childbirth. The reason given by Eustathius why the Poet places the cave by that river is too frivolous to be recited: It is probable that it was called the cave of Ilithya, because some great Lady had made use of it, upon an occasion in which women invoke the assistance of that Goddess; or perhaps because water is one of the great principles of generation, the temple of Lucina could not be placed in a more proper situation, than upon the banks of a river, and close by the sea. Dacier. Where loud Amnisus in the deep is lost. His vessels moor'd, (an incommodious port!) The Heroe speeded to the Cnossian court: Ardent the partner of his arms to find; In leagues of long commutual friendship join'd. Vain hope! ten sons had warm'd the western strand, Since my brave brother with his Cretan band Had sail'd for Troy: but to the genial feast My honour'd roof receiv'd the royal guest: Beeves for his train the Cnossian Peers assign, It was not to be expected, and indeed it was almost impossible that one person should entertain Ulysses and his whole fleet, which consisted of twelves vessels. This passage therefore gives us a remarkable custom of Antiquity, which was, that when any person with too great a number of attendants arrived in other countries, the Prince received the chief personage and his particular friends, and the rest were entertain'd at the public expence. Dacier. A public treat, with jars of gen'rous wine. Twelve days, while Boreas vex'd th'aerial space, My hospitable dome he deign'd to grace: And when the north had ceas'd the stormy roar, He wing'd his voyage to the Phrygian shore. Thus the fam'd Heroe, perfected in wiles, With fair similitude of truth beguiles The word in the Greek is ?????, which has been usually interpreted to be the same with ?????, but those that speak with more exactness derive it from ?????, ???????, ??????????? ???? ????????, that is, he accommodated and adapted his fictions to probability or truth; and Hesychius explains the same word by ??????, ?????: Horace almost literally translates this verse. Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscit, Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepat imum. And indeed in this line the whole art of an Epic Poem is comprehended, which is a mixture of truths and fictions, but fictions conformable to verity; or to speak in the language of a Critic, the fable of the Epic Poem should be both probable and marvellous; astonishing, yet credible: if it be only credible, it differs in nothing from History; if only marvellous, it is no better than a Romance. The great secret therefore of an Epic Writer is to produce in the Reader's mind at the time both belief and astonishment, and this is here perform'd by Ulysses. Dacier sur l'Aristote. The Queen's attentive ear: dissolv'd in woe, From her bright eyes the tears unbounded flow. As snows collected on the mountain freeze; It is not easy to take the point of this simile. Mons. Perault grievously mistakes it: “The description (says he) which Homer gives us of the sorrow of Penelope is very unaccountable; her body melted like snow upon an high mountain, when the east wind melts it, and the snow thus melted fills the rivers; thus it was that the fair cheeks of Penelope melted.” This, says Perault, is translated word for word. But in reality it resembles Homer in nothing but the repetition of the word melted, or ??????, which in modern languages is burthensome to the ear, but not in the Greek; for the word differs from it self according to its different formation, almost as much as a new one, and gives a very distant sound; for instance, ??????, ?????????, ?????????: Whereas there is almost an identity of sound in melt, melted, or melting; or in the French, liquifie, liquifiée, liquifioient. Neither has Perault entered into the sense of the comparison: ?????? ???? is only a figurative hyperbole, as when we say a person is consum'd or wasted with grief; or perhaps ???? signifies no more than humecto, as ??????? humidus. In reality it is the Quantity of tears that is intended to be represented, and the simile is thus to be understood: The snows heap'd upon the mountains by the cold west wind, are the sorrows accumulated in the soul of Penelope; the warm eastern wind, which dissolves these snows, is the recital of Ulysses, which melts those sorrows into tears and makes them flow. When Agamemnon weeps, in the ninth of the Iliad, his tears are compared to a fountain of water falling from a rock; but women being more profuse of tears, those of Penelope are here compared to a river. When milder regions breathe a vernal breeze, The fleecy pile obeys the whisp'ring gales, Ends in a stream, and murmurs thro' the vales: So, melted with the pleasing tale he told, Down her fair cheek the copious torrent roll'd: She to her present Lord laments him lost, Dacier observes that this is added by Homer not for our information, for we already know it; but because it is a reflection which must necessarily occur to every Reader: It is a thing extraordinary to lament a person present, as if he were absolutely lost; and we reap a double satisfaction from the relation, by observing the behaviour of Penelope towards Ulysses, and of Ulysses towards Penelope; while he is at the same time in one sense both absent and present. And views that object which she wants the most! With'ring at heart to see the weeping Fair, His eyes look stern, and cast a gloomy stare; There is a beautiful contrast between Ulysses and Penelope; Penelope indulges her passion for Ulysses, Ulysses restrains his for Penelope: the picture of Ulysses is drawn to the life, he is assaulted at once with several passions, astonishment and admiration on the one side, and compassion and a desire to comfort Penelope on the other; these passions being in an equal ballance, and exerting an equal force, he remains fixed, like a wave driven by contrary winds, and yields to neither of their impulses; it is thus Ulysses continues in a steady admiration, as if he had lost all thought. This passage is too beautiful not to have been explain'd by the Antients: Plutarch quotes it as an instance of the command a wise man ought to have over his passions. “Ulysses who was the most eloquent yet was the most silent of men, all his faculties were obedient, and subject to reason, he commanded his eye not to weep, his tongue not to speak, and his very heart not to pant or tremble: His reason influenc'd even his inward motions, and subdued the very blood and vital spirit.” And in his treatise of Moral Virtues, he again quotes these verses: “Ulysses had compleatly subjected all his faculties to right reason, and he held even his spirits, his blood, and his tears under the government of his judgment.” Virgil paints Dido in the infernal shades almost in the same colours with Ulysses: Illa solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat, Nec magis incepto vultum sermone movetur Quàm si dura filex, aut stet Marpesia cautes. Of horn the stiff relentless balls appear, Eustathius informs us, that Homer apply'd this image of horny, or ???????????, to the eye, because one of the coats of it is said to be of an horny substance; but this is merely fanciful: if another tunic of the eye had been steely, there might have been some ground for the allusion; for Homer joins both of them in the illustration, and only meant to represent the stedfastness of the eye of Ulysses, in this affecting interview. Or globes of iron fix'd in either sphere; Firm wisdom interdicts the soft'ning tear. A speechless interval of grief ensues, 'Till thus the Queen the tender theme renews. Stranger! that e'er thy hospitable roof Ulysses grac'd, confirm by faithful proof: Delineate to my view my warlike Lord, His form, his habit, and his train record. 'Tis hard, he cries, to bring to sudden sight Ideas that have wing'd their distant flight: Rare on the mind those images are trac'd, Whose footsteps twenty winters have defac'd: But what I can, receive.—In ample mode, A robe of military purple flow'd This is a remarkable passage, and gives us an exact description of the habit of a King in the days of Homer, or perhaps still earlier in the days of Ulysses. Purple seems antiently to have been appropriated to Kings, and to them on whom they bestow'd it; thus Judges viii. 26. the sacred Historian mentions purple rayment that was on the Kings of Midian. Thus Esther viii. 15. a garment of fine linen and purple is given to a favourite by King Ahasuerus; and 1 Maccabees xliii. the Jews made a decree, that Simon should wear purple and gold, and that none of the people should wear purple or a buckle of gold without his permission, in token that he was the chief magistrate of the Jews; thus also Mac. x. 89. Alexander sent Jonathan a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given to such as are of the King's blood. Ulysses is here drest much after the same manner; he wears purple, and a buckle or clasp of gold, as a sign of his regality. But what I would chiefly observe is, that the art of embroidery was known in these early ages, nay perhaps was in greater perfection than at this day; the embroidery was of divers colours, as we may gather from the epithet apply'd to the fawn, ????????. Some persons indeed tell us, that this was inwoven into the cloth, and was made in the loom, but the words of Homer will admit of the other interpretation, and it is evident that embroidery was known amongst the Orientals in the age of Ulysses, from Judges v. 20. Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey, to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needle-work, of divers colours of needle-work on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil? Here is evidently mention made of embroidery, and perhaps such was this robe of Ulysses; but however this be, it is manifest that all manner of creatures were figur'd upon the habit of great personages, and that those creatures were inwrought so naturally as to seem to be alive. O'er all his frame: illustrious on his breast, The double-clasping gold the King confest. In the rich woof a hound Mosaic drawn Bore on full stretch, and seiz'd a dappl'd fawn: Deep in the neck his fangs indent their hold; They pant, and struggle in the moving gold. Fine as a filmy web beneath it shon A vest, that dazzl'd like a cloudless sun: The female train who round him throng'd to gaze, In silent wonder sigh'd unwilling praise. A sabre, when the warrior press'd to part, I gave, enamel'd with Vulcanian art: A mantle purple-ting'd, and radiant vest, It may be ask'd, what is the meaning of the ?????????? ?????? here mentioned by Ulysses? Eustathius explains it by ?????????, that is, neither too long nor too short, too wide or too scanty, but exactly corresponding to the make of the body. Hesiod uses the same word in the same sense; and Hesychius interprets it in the same manner, ???????, ??? ????? ??? ????? ??????????????. Dacier. Dimension'd equal to his size, exprest Affection grateful to my honour'd guest. A fav'rite herald in his train I knew, This is very artful in Ulysses: Penelope had ask'd what kind of person her husband was; Ulysses fears to give a description of himself, lest by drawing the copy like the original now before the eyes of Penelope, she should discover him to be Ulysses: He therefore diverts the enquiry, yet at the same time satisfies her curiosity, by adding a new circumstance to confirm his veracity, by describing his attendant and Herald Eurybates. Dacier. His visage solemn sad, of sable hue: Short woolly curls o'erfleec'd his bending head, O'er which a promontory-shoulder spread: Eurybates! in whose large soul alone Ulysses view'd an image of his own. His speech the tempest of her grief restor'd; In all he told she recognis'd her Lord: But when the storm was spent in plenteous show'rs, A pause inspiriting her languish'd pow'rs, O thou, she cry'd, whom first inclement fate Made welcome to my hospitable gate; With all thy wants the name of poor shall end; Henceforth live honour'd, my domestic friend! The vest much envy'd on your native coast, And regal robe with figur'd gold embost, In happier hours my artful hand employ'd, When my lov'd Lord this blissful bow'r enjoy'd: The fall of Troy erroneous and forlorn Doom'd to survive, and never to return! Then he, with pity touch'd: O Royal Dame! Your ever-anxious mind, and beauteous frame, From the devouring rage of grief reclaim. I not the fondness of your soul reprove For such a Lord! who crown'd your virgin-love With the dear blessing of a fair increase; Himself adorn'd with more than mortal grace: Yet while I speak, the mighty woe suspend; Truth forms my tale; to pleasing truth attend. The royal object of your dearest care, Breathes in no distant clime the vital air: In rich Thesprotia, and the nearer bound Of Thessaly, his name I heard renown'd: Without retinue, to that friendly shore Welcom'd with gifts of price, a sumless store! His sacrilegious train, who dar'd to prey On herds devoted to the God of day, Were doom'd by Jove, and Phœbus' just decree, To perish in the rough Trinacrian sea. To better fate the blameless Chief ordain'd, A floating fragment of the wreck regain'd, And rode the storm; 'till by the billows tost, He landed on the fair Phæacian coast. That race, who emulate the life of Gods, Receive him joyous to their blest abodes: Large gifts confer, a ready sail command, To speed his voyage to the Grecian strand. But your wise Lord, (in whose capacious soul High schemes of pow'r in just succession roul) His Ithaca refus'd from fav'ring Fate, Ulysses amass'd great riches by being driven from country to country: Every Prince where he arrived made him great presents, according to the laudable customs of hospitality in former ages. The word in the Greek (observes Dacier) is ??????????, it is borrow'd from beggars, who by strolling from place to place get their livelihood; and hence it was made use of simply to amass, or make collections. Hesychius explains it by ????????, ???????, ???????; in which words there are two errors, and it is manifest they are corrupted: Monsieur le Fevre reads ????????, ???????. Dacier. We may observe that Ulysses gives himself great commendations thro' this whole interview; he calls himself ???? ????????, and says, that there were few men in the world like him; that he was ????? ??????????, or like the Gods: This is not a sign of vanity or ostentation, since Ulysses speaks in the character of a stranger: He must therefore speak in the same manner as a stranger would have spoke; that is, with honour of Ulysses, to ingratiate himself with Penelope. Besides, this conduct conduces to persuade Penelope, that he is the person he pretends to be, and by the consequence contributes to prevent a discovery. 'Till copious wealth might guard his regal state. Phedon the fact affirm'd, whose sovereign sway Thesprotian tribes, a duteous race, obey: And bade the Gods this added truth attest, (While pure libations crown'd the genial feast) That anchor'd in his port the vessels stand, To waft the Heroe to his natal land. I for Dulichium urge the wat'ry way, But first the Ulyssean wealth survey: So rich the value of a store so vast Demands the pomp of centuries to waste! The darling object of your royal love, Was journey'd thence to Dodonean Jove; By the sure precept of the sylvan shrine, To form the conduct of his great design: Irresolute of soul, his state to shrowd In dark disguise, or come, a King avow'd? Thus lives your Lord; nor longer doom'd to roam: Soon will he grace this dear paternal dome. By Jove, the source of good, supreme in pow'r! By the blest genius of this friendly bow'r! I ratifie my speech; before the sun His annual longitude of heav'n shall run; When the pale Empress of yon' starry train In the next month renews her faded wane, Ulysses will assert his rightful reign. What thanks! what boon! reply'd the Queen, are due, When time shall prove the storied blessing true: My Lord's return shou'd fate no more retard, Envy shall sicken at thy vast reward. But my prophetic fears, alas! presage, The wounds of Destiny's relentless rage I long must weep! nor will Ulysses come, With royal gifts to send you honour'd home!— Your other task, ye menial train, forbear: Now wash the stranger, and the bed prepare; This was one of the first rites of hospitality observed towards strangers, amongst the Antients; the Scriptures abound with instances of it: Abraham offers water to wash the feet of the Angels whom he mistook for strangers, &amp;c. There was also a bath for the stranger, but this seems to have been a greater honour (as Dacier observes) than that of washing the feet; this may be gather'd from the manner in which it was performed; the daughters of the family, even young Princesses, assisted at the bath; but the washing the feet was an office committed to servants: Thus the daughter of Nestor in the third Odyssey bath'd Telemachus, but Ulysses being disguis'd like a beggar, Euryclea washes his feet. This agrees exactly with another passage of scripture; when David sent to ask Abigail to wife, 1 Sam. xxv. 41. she made answer, Let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord. My memory fails me, if there be any other passage, either in the Iliad or Odyssey, where this practice of washing the feet is directly mention'd; the reason is, this was an office perform'd only to inferior persons; the bath was for Heroes and Kings. Now both Homer's Poems are fill'd with the characters of such personages, and therefore there was no room to mention it in other places: 'tis true, the word here is ?????????, and does not necessarily imply the washing of the feet, but washing in general: yet here it is to be understood of the feet, for Euryclea in the act of washing them discovers this stranger to be Ulysses. With splendid palls the downy fleece adorn: Up-rising early with the purple morn, His sinews shrunk with age, and stiff with toil, In the warm bath foment with fragrant oil. Then with Telemachus the social feast Partaking free, my sole invited guest; Whoe'er neglects to pay distinction due, The breach of hospitable right may rue. The vulgar of my sex I most exceed In real fame, when most humane my deed: And vainly to the praise of Queen aspire, If stranger! I permit that mean attire, Beneath the feastful bow'r. A narrow space The sense is here cut short, and Homer, like a good Painter, leaves something to be supply'd by the Reader's imagination. Life is short, (says Penelope) we ought therefore to employ it in doing good. The motive indeed which she uses, is not entirely conformable to true Theology; she here proposes glory as the sole aim of doing virtuous actions; tho' in other places Homer plainly asserts, that we ought to act with piety to please the Gods. Dacier. Confines the circle of our destin'd race; 'Tis ours, with good the scanty round to grace. Those who to cruel wrong their state abuse, Dreaded in life, the mutter'd curse persues; By death dis-rob'd of all their savage pow'rs, Then, licens'd rage her hateful prey devours. But he whose in-born worth his acts commend, Of gentle soul, to human race a friend; The wretched he relieves diffuse his fame, And distant tongues extoll the patron-name. Princess, he cry'd, in vain your bounties flow On me, confirm'd, and obstinate in woe, When my lov'd Crete receiv'd my final view, And from my weeping eyes her cliffs withdrew; These tatter'd weeds (my decent robe resign'd.) I chose, the livery of a woful mind! Nor will my heart-corroding cares abate With splendid palls, and canopies of state: Low-couch'd on earth, the gift of sleep I scorn, And catch the glances of the waking morn. The delicacy of your courtly train To wash a wretched wand'rer wou'd disdain; But if, in tract of long experience try'd, I will have an old woman to wash me (says Ulysses.) The reason of this request is not evident at first view; but Eustathius explains it by shewing that Ulysses acts thus to avoid the insults and contempt of the younger damsels of Penelope, who had sufficiently outrag'd him in this and the preceding book; they would think themselves degraded by performing such an office to a beggar. Eustathius remarks, that some antient Critics rejected three verses here: It is absurd, say they, that Ulysses should chuse Euryclea for this office, who was the only person who could discover him, and ruin his designs; he knew she was acquainted with the wound that afterwards discovers him: But the truth is, Ulysses knew Euryclea to be a person of wisdom, and he was in hopes to draw her over to his interest, and make use of her in his affairs in the future parts of the Odyssey; and this he does upon many important occasions, in particular in locking up the Palace at the time of the battle between him and the Suitors; so that by her means he prevents the report of that great incident from being carried to their partizans abroad: here therefore he artfully brings it about, that Euryclea should be assign'd to this office, not only to avoid the insults of the other females, but to make use of her faithfulness and wisdom to carry on his designs, and make the way more easy to the Suitors Destruction. The choice therefore was prudent; she was aged, and acquainted with human miseries, not only by reason of her age, but had herself suffer'd in all the afflictions of Penelope and Telemachus: we find she is described as a mother to the whole family, and she all along adopts the afflictions of it: Eustathius therefore may perhaps be mistaken when he asserts this to be an instance of ill counsels crown'd with good success. But then it may be ask'd, if Euryclea was a person of such wisdom and fidelity, why does not Ulysses trust her with the secret of his return? The reason is plain, it would not only have been contrary to his cautious nature, but a breach of all decency to trust himself to Euryclea, and not to Penelope; this would in some measure have rais'd the character of the servant, above that of his wife and Queen. Part of this note I am indebted for to M. Dacier. And sad similitude of woes ally'd, Some wretch reluctant views aerial light, To her mean hand assign the friendly rite. Pleas'd with his wise reply, the Queen rejoin'd: Such gentle manners, and so sage a mind, In all who grac'd this hospitable bow'r I ne'er discern'd, before this social hour. Such servant as your humble choice requires, To light receiv'd the Lord of my desires, New from the birth: and with a mother's hand His tender bloom to manly growth sustain'd: Of matchless prudence, and a duteous mind; Though now to life's extremest verge declin'd, Of strength superior to the toil assign'd.— Rise, Euryclea! with officious care For the poor friend the cleansing bath prepare: This debt his correspondent fortunes claim, Too like Ulysses, and perhaps the same! Thus old with woes my fancy paints him now! For age untimely marks the careful brow. Instant obsequious to the mild command, Sad Euryclea rose: with trembling hand She veils the torrent of her tearful eyes; Dacier observes that Aristotle in his third book of Rhetoric quotes this action of Euryclea as an instance of a Paralogism familiar to Homer; and again in his Poetics, he cites it to the same purpose: A Paralogism consists in making use of false reasoning, and drawing a false consequence from true premisses. “All men, says Aristotle, are naturally persuaded that where such a thing is, or is done, such another must happen; we may therefore make them easily believe that if the last is, the first must consequently be; but in reality, the latter which we lay down as truth being often false, the former is so more frequently, for it does not follow, that because one thing is, another must necessarily be; but because we are persuaded of the truth of the latter, we conclude falsly, that the former is also true.” The Reader will enter into the meaning of Aristotle, and understand what a Paralogism is, by an example of it; for instance, if we were to prove a man to be in love, we bring it as an argument that he is pale; now this is a false reasoning or paralogism, because a person may be pale from other reasons than love. Thus in the instance of Euryclea, “Homer (says Aristotle) imposes upon his Reader, by mentioning a sign that is known, to draw a consequence from it, to prove a thing that is not known;” that is, Homer endeavours to prove that the whole story concerning Euryclea is true, and that she really hid her eyes when she wept, because this is a consequence of passion, and because it is natural for persons to conceal their eyes with their hands while they weep. This also is a Paralogism, for every syllable concerning Euryclea may be a fiction of the Poet, tho' such a gesture is natural to a person in her circumstances; the imposition consists in this, namely, in the art of the Poet in endeavouring to deceive us into a belief, that because persons when they weep conceal their eyes, therefore it is true that Eurylea thus actually wept; the latter may be evidently, tho' the former be true: Aristotle brings this practice of Homer as an example to all Poets how to tell lies as they ought, or agreeably. And thus impassion'd to herself replies. Son of my love, and Monarch of my cares! What pangs for thee this wretched bosom bears! Are thus by Jove who constant beg his aid With pious deed, and pure devotion, paid? He never dar'd defraud the sacred fane, Of perfect Hecatombs in order slain: There oft implor'd his tutelary pow'r, Long to protract the sad sepulchral hour; That form'd for empire with paternal care, His realm might recognize an equal heir. O destin'd head! The pious vows are lost; Euryclea we see is astonish'd to find that a person who is remarkable for his piety should be unfortunate; the age was not enlighten'd enough to know that calamity is often a proof of virtue, and a tryal not a punishment. Maximus Tyrius, the Platonic 22. dissert. excellently explains this subject: “Who (says that Author) can deny Ulysses to be a man of piety? Jupiter remembers him, Minerva loves him, Mercury guides him, Calypso is enamour'd with him, and Leucothea saves his life! Who then can deny but that Heaven try'd him with all his afflictions, that he might appear to be, and deserve to be called a good man? this is the reason why he suffer'd at Troy, from the Suitors, by the Cyclops, by Circe, and by shipwreck: this is the reason why he wander'd as a vagabond, and a beggar; that he was half naked, that he was struck and insulted, and suffer'd a thousand insolencies from the riots of the Suitors: It was the favour and love of Heaven that brought him into all these afflictions, and not the anger of Neptune.” When a good man suffers, Heav'n frequently chuses him out as an Heroe, who knows how to behave bravely in the day of adversity, and this is agreeable to true Theology. His God forgets him on a foreign coast!— Perhaps, like thee, poor guest! in wanton pride The rich insult him, and the young deride! Conscious of worth revil'd, thy gen'rous mind The friendly rite of purity declin'd; My will concurring with my Queen's command, Accept the bath from this obsequious hand. A strong emotion shakes my anguish'd breast; In thy whole form Ulysses seems exprest: Homer continually draws his reflections from the present object: Penelope, at the sight of this distressed and ill-cloath'd stranger, breaks out into a tender sentiment, and cries, “Perhaps my Ulysses is such as he!” for thus Eustathius applies the expression, ?? ???????? ?? ????? ???? ??? ???????; that is, “he was not such by nature, but misfortune.” But if we understand it of a bodily resemblance, the sentiment is still beautiful, and the Reader cannot without pleasure see Penelope deceived in comparing Ulysses with Ulysses. Dacier. Of all the wretched harbour'd on our coast, None imag'd e'er like thee my master lost. Thus half discover'd thro' the dark disguise, With cool composure feign'd, the Chief replies: This is very artful in Ulysses: If he had deny'd the resemblance, it might have given suspicion; he therefore confesses it, and by confessing it persuades Euryclea that he is not the real Ulysses. Dacier. You join your suffrage to the public vote; The same you think, have all beholders thought. He said: replenish'd from the purest springs, The laver strait with busy care she brings: In the deep vase, that shone like burnish'd gold, The boiling fluid temperates the cold. Mean-time revolving in his thoughtful mind The scar, with which his manly knee was sign'd; His face averting from the crackling blaze, The reason why Ulysses turns toward the darkness is to avoid discovery, and that Euryclea might not examine him too curiously: but this is not the whole design of Homer; the Poet thus describes Ulysses to give probability to the future story; for as Eustathius judiciously remarks, it is from this action alone that the fainting of Euryclea, her laying her hand on the chin of Ulysses, his seisure of her throat to hinder her from discovering him, escape the notice of Penelope; Ulysses is seated out of view, and withdrawn from observation. Dacier. His shoulders intercept th' unfriendly rays. Thus cautious, in th' obscure he hop'd to fly The curious search of Euryclea's eye. Cautious in vain! nor ceas'd the dame to find This story concerning the wound of Ulysses, may, I fear, in some parts of it, seem somewhat tedious; it may therefore be necessary to shew that it is introduc'd with judgment; and tho' not entirely entertaining, yet artful. Aristotle in the eighth Chap. of his Poetics, speaking of the unity of the action of the Odyssey, mentions this wound of Ulysses. Homer, says he, who excell'd other Poets in all respects, seems perfectly to have known this defect, (viz. that all the actions of an Heroe do not constitute the unity of the action, but only such as are capable to be united with the fable) for in composing his Odyssey, he has not mention'd all the adventures of Ulysses: For example, he has not join'd the wound he received upon Parnassus with the account of his feign'd madness, when the Greeks assembled their army; for because one of them happen'd, it was neither necessary nor probable that the other should also happen; but he has inserted all that could have respect to one and the same action. Monsieur Dacier fully explains Aristotle; We have in this precept (observes that Author) two remarkable events in the life of Ulysses; his feign'd madness, and his wound receiv'd upon Parnassus: The Poet mentions the wound, but is silent about his madness: He saw that the latter had no connexion either in truth or probability with the subject of his Poem, and therefore he says not a word of it: he has acted otherwise with respect to the wound receiv'd upon Parnassus; for altho' that wound was no more to the matter of his Poem, than the madness, yet he speaks of it, because he found an opportunity of inserting it so naturally into his principal action, that it becomes a necessary part of it, since it causes a remembrance of his Heroe, that is, since it is the occasion of Euryclea's discovering Ulysses; so that this History which is here related at length is no foreign Episode, but a natural part of the subject, by being thus artfully united to it. This fully teaches us of what nature the different parts which a Poet uses to form one and the same action ought to be; namely, either necessary or probable consequences of one another, as the remembrance of Ulysses was of this wound: every adventure then that has not this connexion ought to be rejected as foreign, and as breaking the unity of the action: And therefore Homer took care not to interrupt the unity of his Odyssey, by the Episode of the feign'd madness of Ulysses; for that incident could not be produc'd by any that were necessary or proper to the Poem, nor produce any that had the least relation to it. Bossu fully agrees with Aristotle and Dacier, and gathers from this Episode that some incidents which make not directly any part of the action or the fable may be inserted into a Poem, if those incidents are necessary to clear up any part of the fable or action. This remembrance, or discovery by the wound, is mention'd in another place; see the twenty-first Odyssey. Aristotle in his seventeenth Chap. of the Poetics prefers this remembrance to that there made to Eumæus; It is (observes that Author) here managed with more address and art; it is done without design, and seems a consequence of the story: There Ulysses himself discovers the wound; here it arises from the subject, and a series of incidents: there Ulysses has recourse to it, and it causes no surprize, because there is no great art in shewing a mark, which we are willing to have known. All remembrances therefore (says Aristotle) which produce their effects by design have little ingenuity: Whereas those which are brought about by chance, surprize us, and are instances of the Poet's art and address. The scar, with which his manly knee was sign'd. This on Parnassus combating the boar, With glancing rage the tusky savage tore. Attended by his brave maternal race, His grandsire sent him to the sylvan chace, Autolycus the bold: (a mighty name This difficult passage is well explain'd by Dacier and Eustathius: The words are ? ?? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???? ?? ? which literally run thus, “he surpass'd all men in swearing and stealing:” a terrible character! if it were to be understood according to the letter: It has been imagined, that Homer commends Autylocus for his address in robbery, and making equivocal oaths; like the person (says Eustathius) who made a truce with his enemies for several days, and immediately went and ravag'd their territories by night, and defended it, by telling them that the truce was not made for the night but the day: or like the person mention'd by Athenæus, who stole a fish, and gave it to his neighbour, and being question'd about it swore, that he had it not himself, nor saw any other person steal it: but this is not the meaning of Homer, for he calls Autolycus ?????? or a good man, and adds that this ?????????? ??? ?????, was the gift of a God. The truth is, the former word does not here signifie theft, nor the latter perjury: the former signifies a laudable address in concealing our own designs, and discovering those of our enemies; it consists in surprising them, when they least expect us, in beating up their quarters, carrying off their convoys, their provisions, and in short in all manner of stratagems, authoriz'd by the laws of war: ????? signifies fidelity in observing an oath, and never violating the sanctity of it. Plato in his first book de Repub. makes it plain, that this is the sense of Homer: He there quotes this passage, and asserts that he is the best guardian of an army who knows how to steal the counsels and enterprises of the enemy, ?? ??? ???????? ?????? ??????????, ??? ??? ????? ???????; from this, it is there inferr'd, that justice is a kind of chicanery (???????? ??? ??? ??????? ?????, ??? ????? ??? ??????) by which we serve our friends, and bring detriment to our enemies; but the answer there given to this assertion is, ?? ?? ??? ???, or, by no means: It must be understood with some restriction: It is lawful to decieve an enemy in war, but in common life criminal. The qualities therefore that Homer commends in Autolycus, are his dexterity in discovering, penetrating and preventing the designs of his enemies, and the religious observance of his oaths, and not theft and perjury; Eustathius explains Homer by adding ??????????? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??????. For spotless faith, and deeds of martial fame: Hermes his Patron-god those gifts bestow'd, The reason why Homer attributes these gifts to Mercury is, because he was the president of secrecy, or of all things that are acted with a desire of concealment. He is also the God of speech, it therefore appertain'd to that Deity to guard the verity of it, in particular of oaths, being the precedent of speaking. Dacier. Whose shrine with weanling lambs he wont to load.) His course to Ithaca this Heroe sped, When the first product of Laertes' bed Was new disclos'd to birth: the banquet ends, When Euryclea from the Queen descends, And to his fond embrace the babe commends. “Receive, she cries, your royal daughter's son; We have here an antient custom observ'd by the Greeks: The child was placed by the father upon the grandfather's knees, as a token that a grandchild was the most agreeable present that a son could make to a father.

That is, the father of Phœnix imprecated the furies, that Phœnix might never have a son to place upon his grandfather's knees.

Lur'd with the promis'd boon, when youthful prime Ended in man, his mother's natal clime Ulysses sought; with fond affection dear Amphithea's arms receiv'd the royal heir: Her antient Autolycus.Lord an equal joy possest; Instant he bade prepare the genial feast: A steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled, Whose stately growth five flow'ry summers fed: His sons divide, and roast with artful care The limbs; then all the tasteful viands share. Nor ceas'd discourse (the banquet of the soul) 'Till Phœbus wheeling to the western goal Resign'd the skies, and night involv'd the pole. Their drooping eyes the slumb'rous shade opprest, Sated they rose, and all retir'd to rest. Soon as the morn, new-rob'd in purple light, Pierc'd with her golden shafts the rear of night; Ulysses, and his brave maternal race The young Autolyci, assay the chace. Parnassus, thick perplex'd with horrid shades, With deep-mouth'd hounds the hunter-troop invades; What time the sun, from ocean's peaceful stream, Darts o'er the lawn his horizontal beam. The pack impatient snuff the tainted gale; The thorny wilds the wood-men fierce assail: And foremost of the train, his cornel spear Ulysses wav'd, to rouze the savage war. Deep in the rough recesses of the wood, A lofty copse, the growth of ages, stood: Nor winter's boreal blast, nor thund'rous show'r, Nor solar ray, cou'd pierce the shady bow'r, With wither'd foliage strew'd, a heapy store! The warm pavilion of a dreadful boar. Rous'd by the hounds and hunters' mingling cries, The savage from his leafy sounder flies: With fiery glare his sanguine eye-balls shine, And bristles high impale his horrid chine. Young Ithacus advanc'd, defies the foe, Poising his lifted lance in act to throw: The savage renders vain the wound decreed, And springs impetuous with opponent speed! His tusks oblique he aim'd the knee to goar; Aslope they glanc'd, the sinewy fibres tore, And bar'd the bone: Ulysses undismay'd, Soon with redoubl'd force the wound repay'd; To the right shoulder-joint the spear apply'd, His further flank with streaming purple dy'd: On earth he rush'd with agonizing pain; With joy, and vast surprize, th' applauding train View'd his enormous bulk extended on the plain. With bandage firm Ulysses' knee they bound; Then chaunting mystic lays, the closing wound This is a remarkable instance of the antiquity of that idle superstition of curing wounds by incantation or charms: yet Homer is no way blameable for mentioning it; he wrote according to the opinion of the age, which whether true or false vindicates him as a Poet. Indeed almost all other Poets have spoken more boldly than Homer of the power of incantations; thus Virgil, Carmina vel cœlo possunt deducere lunam, Carminibus Circe socios mutavit Ulyssei, Frigidus in pratis cantaudo rumpitur anguis. But we may defend Homer from Pliny, who has thought this point, viz. whether charms are available physically, worthy of a serious discussion; he refers to this passage in his natural History, lib. 28. cap. 1. Dixit Homerus profluvium sanguinis vulnerato femine Ulyssem inhibuisse carmine, Theophrastus, Ischiadicos sanari, Cato prodidit Luxatis membris carmen auxiliari, Varro Podagris. Attalus affirms, that if a man chance to spy a scorpion, and pronounce the word duo, it will lie still, and never shoot his sting. I think these grave Authors outdo even the fictions of Poets; and I hardly believe that any of them would have ventur'd to provoke a serpent, trusting to the charm. But we are to understand this charm not merely as a form of words, but as join'd with musical notes, and then it may appear more rational: for the cure of the Sciatica, Theophrastus commends the Phrygian music, and A. Gellius for giving ease to it; but adds, ut Memoriæ proditum est. Apollonius in his book de Miris, affirms from Theophrastus, that Music cures many diseases both of mind and body, ??????? ???????????, ??????, ??? ??? ??? ?????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ????????, ????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????????. And the same Author affirms, that many in his time, especially the Thebans, used the pipe for the cure of several sicknesses, which Galen calls ????????? ??? ?????, super loco affecto tibiâ canere; or loca dolentia decantare. I will not affirm that such charms of music have no power in some maladies; every one knows what an effect the harp of David had over the spirits of Saul; but we have either lost, or not yet found out the art: A natural reason may be assign'd for it, for as the musical notes move the air, so the air moves the inward spirits, and the humours of the body, which are the seat of diseases; so that by this new motion they may be condensed, rarified, dissipated or expell'd, according as they are agitated or influenc'd by the concussion of the musical notes; but however this be, if other Poets may say that charms have power to stop rivers in their courses, Homer is not to be condemned for ascribing the power of stopping blood to incantations. See Mr. Cowley's Notes on the first book of his Davideis. Of sacred melody confess'd the force; The tides of life regain'd their azure course. Then back they led the youth with loud acclaim; Autolycus, enamour'd with his fame, Confirm'd the cure: and from the Delphic dome With added gifts return'd him glorious home. He safe at Ithaca with joy receiv'd, Relates the chace, and early praise atchiev'd. Deep o'er his knee inseam'd, remain'd the scar: Which noted token of the woodland war When Euryclea found, the ablution ceas'd; Down dropp'd the leg, from her slack hand releas'd! The mingled fluids from the vase redound; The vase reclining floats the floor around! Smiles dew'd with tears the pleasing strife exprest Of grief, and joy, alternate in her breast. Her flutt'ring words in melting murmurs dy'd; At length abrupt—my son!—my King!—she cry'd. It may seem incredible that this dialogue between Ulysses and Euryclea could be held in the presence of Penelope, and she not hear it: How is this to be reconciled to probability? I will answer in the words of Eustathius: The Poet, says he, has admirably guarded against this objection; it is for this reason that he mentions the falling of Ulysses's leg into the water, the sound of the vessel from that accident, the overturning of it, and the effusion of the water: all these different sounds may easily be supposed to drown the voice of Euryclea, so as it might not be heard by Penelope; it is true, she could not but observe this confusion that happen'd while Euryclea washes; but the age of Euryclea might naturally make her believe that all this happen'd by accident thro' her feebleness, and Penelope might be persuaded that it was thus occasioned, having no reason to suspect the truth: besides, what is more frequent on the Theatre than to speak to the audience, while the persons on the stage are supposed not to hear? In reality, it is evident that Ulysses and Euryclea were at a proper distance from Penelope, probably out of decency while the feet were washing; for as soon as that office is over, Homer tells us that Ulysses drew nearer to the fire where Penelope sate, that he might resume the conference. ????? ??? ???????? ????? ?????? ?????? ????????. His neck with fond embrace infolding fast, Full on the Queen her raptur'd eyes she cast, Ardent to speak the Monarch safe restor'd: But studious to conceal her royal Lord, Minerva fix'd her mind on views remote, And from the present bliss abstracts her thought. His hand to Euryclea's mouth apply'd, Art thou foredoom'd my pest? the Heroe cry'd: Thy milky founts my infant lips have drain'd; And have the Fates, thy babling age ordain'd To violate the life thy youth sustain'd? An exile have I told, with weeping eyes, Full twenty annual suns in distant skies: At length return'd, some God inspires thy breast To know thy King, and here I stand confest. This heav'n-discover'd truth to thee consign'd, Reserve, the treasure of thy inmost mind: Else if the Gods my vengeful arm sustain, And prostrate to my sword the Suitor-train; With their lewd mates, thy undistinguish'd age Shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage. Then thus rejoin'd the dame, devoid of fear: What words, my son, have pass'd thy lips severe? Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secur'd, Plutarch in his treatise upon Garrulity observes, that Ulysses and every person that had relation to him were remarkable for their taciturnity: they had all profited under so great a master of secrecy as Ulysses: It is practis'd by his wife, his son, and his nurse; his very companions, who attended him in his voyages, possess'd this virtue in so eminent a degree as to suffer themselves to be dash'd in pieces by the Cyclops, rather than discover him to that giant. The moral that we are to gather from this fable is, that the safety of Princes' Counsels consists in secrecy. Dacier. With ribs of steel, and marble heart immur'd. When heav'n, auspicious to thy right avow'd, Shall prostrate to thy sword the Suitor-crowd; The deeds I'll blazon of the menial fair; The lewd to death devote, the virtuous spare. Thy aids avails me not, the Chief reply'd; My own experience shall their doom decide; A witness-judge precludes a long appeal: Suffice it thee thy Monarch to conceal. He said: obsequious with redoubl'd pace, She to the fount conveys th' exhausted vase: The bath renew'd, she ends the pleasing toil With plenteous unction We are not to imagine that this custom of anointing the feet was an instance of luxury; it prevail'd over the oriental world solely out of necessity, to avoid offensiveness in those hot regions. This custom prevail'd many ages after Homer, and we have an instance of it in the woman who wash'd the feet of our Lord and Saviour with tears, and anointed them with oil. This place is a plain proof that oil was used after washing the feet as well as after bathing. of ambrosial oil. Adjusting to his limbs the tatter'd vest, His former seat receiv'd the stranger-guest; Whom thus with pensive air the Queen addrest. Tho' night, dissolving grief in grateful ease, Your drooping eyes with soft oppression seize; Awhile, reluctant to her pleasing force, Suspend the restful hour with sweet discourse. The day (ne'er brighten'd with a beam of joy!) My menials, and domestic cares employ: And, unattended by sincere repose, The night assists my ever-wakeful woes: When nature's hush'd beneath her brooding shade, My echoing griefs the starry vault invade. As when the months are clad in flow'ry green, Sad Philomel, in bow'ry shades unseen, This passage is thus explain'd by Eustathius. The simile is not only introduced to express the sorrow of Penelope, but the nature of it: It is not so much intended to illustrate her grief, as her various agitations and different thoughts compared to the different accents in the mournful song of the nightingale; for thus Homer applies it. ?? ??? ???? ???? ????? ???????? ???? ??? ????. Eustathius adds, that Homer relates this story very differently from later Authors: He mentions nothing of Progne, Tereus, or Pandion, unless that name be the same with Pandareus; Itylus likewise is by them call'd Itys. The story is thus, according to these writers: Philomela was the wife of Tereus King of Thrace, she had a sister nam'd Progue, whom Tereus ravish'd and cut her tongue out, that she might not discover the crime to Philomela; but Progne betray'd it by weaving the story in a piece of embroidery; upon this Philomela slew her own son Itys or Itylus, and serv'd up his flesh to the table of her husband Tereus; which being made known to him he pursues Philomela and Progne, who are feign'd to be chang'd into birds for their swift flight into Athens, by which they escap'd the revenge of Tereus. Philomela is fabled to be turn'd into a nightingale, and Progne into a swallow; it being observed by Pausanias, that no swallow ever builds in Thrace, or nightingale is ever seen there, as hating the country of Tereus. But Homer follows a different history: Pandareus son of Merops had three daughters, Meropè, Cleothera, and Aëdon: Pandareus married his eldest daughter Aëdon to Zethus brother of Amphion, mentioned in the eleventh Odyssey; she had an only son nam'd Itylus; and being envious at the numerous family of her brother-in-law Amphion, she resolves to murther Amaleus the eldest of her nephews; her own son Itylus was brought up with the children of Amphion, and lay in the same bed with this Amaleus. Aëdon directs her son Itylus to absent himself one night from the bed, but he forgets her orders; at the time determin'd, she conveys her self into the apartment, and murthers her own son Itylus, by mistake, instead of her nephew Amaleus: upon this, almost in distraction, she begs the Gods to remove her from the race of humankind, they grant her prayer, and change her into a nightingale. To vernal airs attunes her varied strains; And Itylus sounds warbling o'er the plains: Young Itylus, his parents darling joy! Whom chance mis-led the mother to destroy: Now doom'd a wakeful bird to wail the beauteous boy. So in nocturnal solitude forlorn, A sad variety of woes I mourn! My mind reflective, in a thorny maze Devious, from care to care incessant strays. Now, wav'ring doubt succeeds to long despair; Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere; And joining to my son's my menial train, Partake his councils, and assist his reign? Or, since mature in manhood, he deplores His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores; Shall I, reluctant! to his will accord; And from the Peers select the noblest Lord; So by my choice avow'd, at length decide These wasteful love-debates, a mourning bride?— A visionary thought I'll now relate, Illustrate, if you know, the shadow'd fate. A team of twenty geese, (a snow-white train!) Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain, Amuse my pensive hours. The bird of Jove Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove; Each fav'rite fowl he pounc'd with deathful sway, And back triumphant wing'd his airy way. My pitying eyes effus'd a plenteous stream, To view their death thus imag'd in a dream: With tender sympathy to sooth my soul, A troop of matrons, fancy-form'd, condole. But whilst with grief and rage my bosom burn'd, Sudden the tyrant of the skies return'd: Perch'd on the battlements he thus began, (In form an eagle, but in voice a man.) O Queen! no vulgar vision of the sky I come, prophetic of approaching joy: View in this plumy form thy victor Lord; The geese (a glutton race) by thee deplor'd, Portend the Suitors fated to my sword. This said, the pleasing feather'd omen ceas'd. When from the downy bands of sleep releas'd, Fast by the limpid lake my swan-like train I found, insatiate of the golden grain. The vision self-explain'd (the Chief replies.) Sincere reveals the sanction of the skies: Ulysses speaks his own return decreed; And by his sword the Suitors sure to bleed. Hard is the task, and rare, the Queen rejoin'd, Impending destinies in dreams to find: Immur'd within the silent bow'r of Sleep, This seems to be a bold fiction, and Commentators have labour'd hard to shew the reason of it: Some imagine, that by the horn is meant a tunic of the eye, which is call'd horny; and that the ivory represents the teeth; and that by these allusions the Poet intended to express that what we hear spoken may be false, but what we see must infallibly be true: that is, according to this fable, the ivory gate emits falshood, that of horn, truth. Others explain Homer by referring to the nature of horn and ivory, horn being pervious to the sight, and ivory impenetrable. Dacier, from Eustathius, gives us a very different solution; by horn which is transparent, Homer means the air, or heavens which are translucent; by ivory, he denotes the earth which is gross and opake: Thus the dreams which come from the earth, that is, thro' the gate of ivory, are false; those from heaven, or thro' the gate of horn, true. But it may be thought that there are no grounds, from the words of Homer, for such an interpretation. I imagine that this fable is built upon a real foundation, and that there were places call'd the gates of falshood and truth: Diodorus Siculus in his second book describing the ceremonies concerning the dead, mentions the gates of oblivion, of hatred and lamentation; and then adds, that there are other gates in the same place; namely, in Memphis in Ægypt, that are called the gates of verity, near which there is a statue of justice without an head; now Homer in the twenty-fourth Odyssey places the region of dreams in the way to the infernal shades, and it is past dispute that he borrows all these fables of Styx, Cocytus, (that is, of the gates of hatred, lamentation,) &amp;c. from Ægypt, and places them in hell, after Orpheus, who adapted all his ceremonies according to the rites of burial observ'd at Memphis, as Diodorus fully proves: if therefore he borrows the fable of the gates of oblivion, &amp;c. from Ægypt, why may he not the story of the gates of falshood and verity? especially since he takes his whole relation concerning hell from the customs of the Ægyptians, and this region of dreams is placed by him in the passage to hell: It may therefore not be impossible but this story of the gates of sleep, may have a real foundation, and be built upon the customs of the Ægyptians. Two portals firm the various phantoms keep: Of iv'ry one; whence flit to mock the brain, Of wing'd Lies a light fantastic train: The gate oppos'd pellucid valves adorn, And columns fair incas'd with polish'd horn: Where images of truth for passage wait, With visions manifest of future fate. Not to this troop, I fear, that phantom soar'd, Which spoke Ulysses to his realm restor'd; Delusive semblance!—But my remnant life Heav'n shall determine in a gameful strife: With that fam'd bow Ulysses taught to bend, For me the rival archers shall contend. As on the listed field he us'd to place Six beams, oppos'd to six in equal space: Elanc'd a-far by his unerring art, Sure thro' six circlets flew the whizzing dart. So, when the sun restores the purple day, Their strength and skill the Suitors shall assay: To him the spousal honour is decreed, Who thro' the rings directs the feather'd reed. Torn from these walls (where long the kinder pow'rs With pomp and joy have wing'd my youthful hours!) On this poor breast no dawn of bliss shall beam; The pleasure past supplies a copious theme For many a dreary thought, and many a doleful dream! Propose the sportive lot, the Chief replies, Nor dread to name your self the bowyer's prize: Ulysses will surprize the unfinish'd game Avow'd, and falsify the Suitors' claim. To whom with grace serene the Queen rejoin'd: In all thy speech what pleasing force I find! O'er my suspended woe thy words prevail, I part reluctant from the pleasing tale. But Heav'n that knows what all terrestrials need, Repose to night, and toil to day decreed: Grateful vicissitude! Yet me withdrawn, Wakeful to weep and watch the tardy dawn Establish'd use enjoins; to rest and joy Estrang'd, since dear Ulysses sail'd to Troy! Mean-time instructed is the menial tribe Your couch to fashion as your self prescribe. Thus affable, her bow'r the Queen ascends; The sov'reign step a beauteous train attends: There imag'd to her soul Ulysses rose; Down her pale cheek new-streaming sorrow flows: 'Till soft oblivious shade Minerva spread, And o'er her eyes ambrosial slumber shed.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. V. THE TWENTIETH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. While Ulysses lies in the Vestibule of the Palace, he is witness to the disorders of the women. Minerva comforts him and casts him asleep. At his awaking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter, which is granted. The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the People, and the Suitors banquet in the Palace. Telemachus exerts his authority amongst them, notwithstanding which, Ulysses is insulted by Ctesippus, and the rest continue in their excesses. Strange Prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus the Augur, who explains them to the destruction of the Wooers. An ample hide divine Ulysses spread, And form'd of fleecy skins his humble bed: (The remnants of the spoil the suitor-crowd In festival devour'd, and victims vow'd.) Then o'er the chief, Eurynome the chaste With duteous care a downy carpet cast: With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows, And ruminating wrath, he scorns repose. As thus pavilion'd in the porch he lay, Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey. Whilst to nocturnal joys impure, repair With wanton glee, the prostituted fair. Eustathius expariates upon the conduct of these female servants of Penelope. Silence and a decent reserve (remarks that Author) is the ornament of the fair sex; levity and laughter betray them into an unguarded behaviour, and make them susceptible of wanton impressions. The Athenians, as Pausanias informs us, had a Temple sacred to Love and Venus the Whisperer. Venus was call'd the Whisperer (???????) because they who there offer'd up their prayers apply'd their mouths to the ear of the statue of that Goddess, and whisper'd their petitions; an Intimation, that Women ought to govern their tongue, and not let it transgress either by loudness or loquacity. But this no ways affects the Ladies of Great Britain; they speak so well, they should never be silent. Ulysses, Homer tells us, is almost provok'd to kill these females with his own hands: This has been imagin'd a thought unworthy an Heroe. The like objection has been made against Æneas in Virgil (Æneid; lib. 2. ver. 567.) Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide, The graceless Helen in the porch I spy'd Of Vesta's temple: there she lurk'd alone, Muffl'd she sate, and what she could, unknown; Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard, Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward. This whole passage is said to have been expung'd from Virgil by Tucca and Varius; for as Virgil there expresses it, 'Tis true a soldier can small honour gain, And boast no conquest from a woman slain. Dryden. But the Objection is probably made with too great severity, both against Homer and Virgil: It is no disgrace to the best or bravest man, to be subject to such passions as betray him into no unworthy actions: A Heroe is not suppos'd to be insensible; he distinguishes himself as such, if he restrains them within the bounds of reason. Both Æneas and Ulysses are fir'd with a just indignation, and this is agreeable to human nature; but both of them proceed to no outragious action, and this shews that their passions are govern'd by superior reason. However this resentment of Ulysses is less liable to objection than that of Æneas: Ulysses subdues his indignation by the reflection of his own reason; but Virgil introduces a Machine to compose the spirit of Æneas: ? all shining heav'nly bright, My mother stood reveal'd before my sight, She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break, &amp;c. It may be further added that the case is very different between Æneas and Ulysses. The persons whom Ulysses intends to punish are his subjects and servants, and such a punishment would be no more than an act of justice, as he is their Master and King; and we find in the sequel of the Odyssey that he actually inflicts it. It should therefore be thought an instance of Homer's judgment, in painting the disorders of these servants in such strong colours, that we may acknowledge the justice, when he afterwards brings them to punishment. His heart with rage this new dishonour stung, Wav'ring his thoughts in dubious balance hung; Or, instant should he quench the guilty flame With their own blood, and intercept the shame; Or to their lust indulge a last embrace, And let the Peers consummate the disgrace? Round his swol'n heart the murm'rous fury rowls; As o'er her young the mother-mastiff growls, This in the original is a very bold expression, but Homer, to soften it, instances a comparison which reconciles us to it. Ennius has literally translated it, as Spondanus observes: ? animusque in pectore latrat. That is word for word, ? ?????? ?? ?? ????? ???????. The similitude it self is very expressive; as the mastiff barks to guard her young, so labours the soul of Ulysses in defence of his Son and Wife, Penelope and Telemachus. Dacier was afraid that the comparison could not be render'd with any beauty in the French tongue, and therefore has substituted another in the room of it, Son cœur rugissoit an dedans de luy, comme un Lion rugit autour d'une bergerie, où il ne sçauroit entrer. But however more noble the Lion may be than the Mastiff, it is evident that she utterly deviates from the allusion: The Mastiff rages in defence of her young, Ulysses of his Son Telemachus; but how is this represented by a Lion roaring round a fold, which he is not to defend, but destroy? We have therefore chosen to follow Homer in the more humble but more expressive similitude; and what will entirely reconcile us to it, is the great honour which was paid to Dogs by the Antients: they were kept as a piece of state by Princes and Heroes, and therefore a comparison drawn from them was held to be as noble as if it had been drawn from a Lion. And bays the stranger groom: so wrath comprest Recoiling, mutter'd thunder in his breast. Poor suff'ring heart! he cry'd, support the pain These two Verses are quoted by Plato in his Phædo, where he treats of the soul's immortality; He makes use of them to prove that Homer understood the soul to be uncompounded and distinct from the body. “If the soul, argues that Author, were a compounded substance, if it were harmony (as some philosophically assert) she would never act discordantly from the parts which compose it; but we see the contrary, we see the soul guide and govern the parts of which she her self is pretended to be composed; she resists, threatens and restrains our passions, our fears, avarice and anger: in short, the soul speaks to the body as to a substance of a nature entirely different from its own. Homer therefore evidently understood that the soul ought to govern and direct the passions, and that it is of a nature more divine than harmony. This is undoubtedly very just reasoning: and there is an expression, observes Dacier, that bears the same import in the holy Scriptures: The heart of David smote him when he number'd the people. There is this difference; in Homer by heart is understood the corporeal substance, in the Scriptures the spiritual; but both make a manifest distinction between the soul and the body. Of wounded honour, and thy rage restrain. Not fiercer woes thy fortitude cou'd foil, When the brave partners of thy ten years toil Dire Polypheme devour'd: I then was freed By patient prudence, from the death decreed. Thus anchor'd safe on reason's peaceful coast, Tempests of wrath his soul no longer tost; Restless his body rolls, to rage resign'd: As one who long with pale-ey'd famine pin'd, No passage in the whole Odyssey has fall'n under more ridicule than this comparison; Monsieur Perault is particularly severe upon it: Homer (says that Critic) compares Ulysses turning in his bed to a black-pudding broiling on a gridiron; whereas the truth is, he compares that Hero turning and tossing in his bed, burning with impatience to satisfy himself with the blood of the Suitors, to a man in sharp hunger preparing the entrails of a victim over a great fire; and the agitation represents the agitation of Ulysses. Homer compares not the thing, but the persons. Boileau, in his notes upon Longinus, answers this objection. It is notorious that the belly of some animals was one of the most delicious dishes amongst the antients: that the sumex or sow's belly was boasted of for its excellence by the Romans, and forbidden by a sumptuary law as too voluptuous. Besides, the Greek word used to express a black-pudding was not invented in the days of Homer. Ogylby indeed thus renders it: As one a pudding broiling on the coals. But you will ask, Is not the allusion mean at best, and does it not convey a low image? Monsieur Dacier answers in the negative, in his notes upon Aristotles's Poetics. The comparison is borrow'd from sacrifices which yielded blood and fat, and was therefore so far from being despicable, that it was look'd upon with veneration by antiquity. Lib. 1. of the Iliad. On these, in double cawls involv'd with art, The choicest morsels lay from every part. The Cawls and the choicest morsels were the fat of the Victim, selected as the best part of it, to be offered to the Gods. We may find that the thought was noble in the oriental language, for the Author of Ecclesiast. makes use of it, 47. 2. As in the fat taken from the peace-offering, so was David chosen out of the children of Israel. And the same allusion which was used to represent the worth and excellence of David, could be no degradation to Ulysses. But what is understood by the belly of the beast, full of fat and blood? Boileau is of opinion that those words denote the fat and the blood which are in those parts of an animal naturally: but he is in an error, as appears evidently from these lines, lib. 18. of the Odyssey. ???????? ?? ?? ????? ????? ?? ????? ??? ?? ??? ????? ????????? ??????? ?? ??? ??????? ???????????. Implentes sanguine &amp; pinguedine, in cœnâ deponamus; a demonstration that Homer intends not the natural fat and blood of the animal. The sav'ry cates on glowing embers cast Incessant turns, impatient for repast: Ulysses so, from side to side devolv'd, In self-debate the Suitors doom resolv'd. When in the form of mortal nymph array'd, From heav'n descends the Jove-born martial Maid; And hov'ring o'er his head in view confess'd, The Goddess thus her fav'rite care address'd. Oh thou, of mortals most inur'd to woes! Why rowl those eyes unfriended of repose? Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care; Blest in thy Queen! blest in thy blooming heir! Whom, to the Gods when suppliant fathers bow, They name the standard of their dearest vow. Just is thy kind reproach (the chief rejoin'd) Deeds full of fate distract my various mind, In contemplation rapt. This hostile crew What single arm hath prowess to subdue? Or if by Jove's, and thy auxiliar aid, They're doom'd to bleed; O say, cœlestial maid: Where shall Ulysses shun, or how sustain, Nations embattel'd to revenge the slain? Oh impotence of faith! Minerva cries, If man on frail unknowing man relies, There is excellent reasoning in this: If a friend whom we know to be wise and powerful, advises us, we are ready to follow his instructions; the divine Being gives us his council, and we refuse it. Monsieur Dacier observes that Epictetus had this passage in his view, and beautify'd his morality with it. “The protection of a Prince or Potentate (says that Author) gives us full tranquillity, and banishes from us all uneasy apprehension. We have an all-powerful Being for our Protector, and for our Father; and yet the knowledge of it is not sufficient to drive away our fears, inquietudes and discontents.” What Homer further puts into the mouth of the Goddess of Wisdom is consonant to sacred verity, and agrees with the language of the holy Scripture; Psalm xxvii. 3. Tho' an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my Heart be afraid. The Poet almost in every book mentions the destruction of the Suitors by the single hand of Ulysses, to reconcile us to it by degrees, that we may not be shock'd at the great Catastrophe of the Poem as incredible: It is particularly judicious to insist upon it in this place in a manner so solemn, to prepare us for the approaching event. If the destruction of the Suitors should appear humanly improbable by being ascribed solely to Ulysses, it is at least reconcileable to divine probability, and becomes credible thro' the Intervention of a Goddess. Doubt you the Gods? Lo Pallas' self descends, Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends. In me affianc'd, fortify thy breast, Tho' myriads leagu'd thy rightful claim contest; My sure divinity shall bear the shield, And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field. Now, pay the debt to craving nature due, Her faded pow'rs with balmy rest renew. She ceas'd: Ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes; His care dissolves in visionary joys: The Goddess pleas'd, regains her natal skies. Not so the Queen; The downy bands of sleep By grief relax'd, she wak'd again to sleep A gloomy pause ensu'd of dumb despair; Then thus her fate invok'd, with fervent pray'r. Diana! speed thy deathful ebon dart, I doubt not but the Reader will be pleas'd with the beauty of this soliloquy. There is an assemblage of tender images and moving complaints, and yet they are such as betray no meanness of spirit: The lamentation of Penelope is the lamentation of a Queen and Heroine; she mourns, but it is with dignity. The Poet makes a good use of her sorrows, and they excellently sustain her character of persevering to elude the addresses of the Suitors, when she wishes even to die rather than to yield to them. But I confess the inserting so many particularities of the daughters of Pandarus, &amp;c. greatly lessens the pathetic of this speech. And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart. Snatch me, ye whirlwinds! far from human race, The antients (says Dacier) were persuaded that some persons were carried away by storms and whirlwinds. I would rather imagine such expressions to be entirely figurative and poetical; it is probable that what gave occasion to these fictions might be no more than the sudden deaths of some persons, and their disappearance was ascrib'd, in the language of Poetry, to storms and whirlwinds. The Orientals delighted in such bold figures. Job xxvii. 21. The east wind carrieth him away, and as a storm hurrieth him out of his place. And Isaiah xli. 16. The wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them. Tost thro' the void, illimitable space: Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud, Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shrow'd! So, Pandarus, thy hopes, three orphan fair Were doom'd to wander thro' the devious air; Thy self untimely and thy consort dy'd, But four Cœlestials both your cares supply'd. Venus in tender delicacy rears Monsieur Dacier observes upon this passage; Venus is said to feed these Infants with wine, milk, and honey; that is, she nursed them in their infancy, with plenty and abundance. For this is the import of the expression: a land flowing with milk and honey means a land of the greatest fertility, as is evident from the writings of Moses. So the prophet. Butter and honey shall he eat, till he knows how to refuse the evil and chuse the good; that is, till the age of discretion. With honey, milk, and wine, their infant years: Imperial Juno to their youth assign'd It may seem that Homer ascribes improper gifts to this Goddess; Wisdom is the portion of Minerva, Beauty of Venus, why then are they here ascrib'd to Juno? Spondanus calls this an insolvable difficulty. Dacier explains it by saying, that the beauty of Princesses is different from that of persons of an inferior station, their beauty consists in a majesty that is every way great and noble, and strikes with awe, very different from the little affectations and formal softnesses of inferior beauty; the former kind is the gift of Venus to the lower part of the fair sex, the latter is bestow'd on Princesses and Queens, by Juno the Regent of the skies. A form majestic, and sagacious mind: With shapely growth Diana grac'd their bloom; And Pallas taught the texture of the loom. But whilst to learn their lots in nuptial love, Bright Cytherea sought the bow'r of Jove; (The God supreme, to whose eternal eye The registers of fate expanded lie) Wing'd Harpies snatch'd th' unguarded charge away, It is not evident what is meant by these Princesses being carried away by the Harpies: Eustathius thinks that they wander'd from their own country, and fell into the power of cruel governesses, whose severities the Poet ascribes to the ????????, or Furies. Dacier imagines, that these two Princesses having seen the unhappy fate of their sister Aëdon (who was married to Zethus, and slew her own son) fear'd a like calamity; and dreading marriage, retir'd to some distant solitude, where never being heard of, it gave room for the fiction. It must be allow'd that the thought excellently agrees with the wishes of Penelope: These Princesses were taken away at the point of their marriage; Penelope believes herself to be in the same condition. and wishes to be lost rather than submit to second nuptials. This Speech has a further effect; we find Penelope reduc'd to the utmost exigency, she has no further subterfuge: the Poet therefore judiciously paints this exigency in the strongest colours, to shew the necessity of unravelling the intrigue of the Poem in the conclusion of the Odyssey. And to the Furies bore a grateful prey. Be such my lot! Or thou Diana speed Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead: To seek my Lord among the warrior-train, E're second vows my bridal faith profane. When woes the waking sense alone assail, Whilst night extends her soft oblivious veil, Of other wretches care the torture ends: No truce the warfare of my heart suspends! The night renews the day-distracting theme, And airy terrors sable ev'ry dream. The last alone a kind illusion wrought, And to my bed my lov'd Ulysses brought, In manly bloom, and each majestic grace As when for Troy he left my fond embrace: This little circumstance is not without a good effect: it shews that the whole soul of Penelope was possess'd with the image of Ulysses. Homer adds, such as he was when he sail'd to Troy; which is inserted to take off our wonder that she should not discover him; this Ulysses in disguise is not like the Ulysses she formerly knew, and now delineates in her imagination. Eustathius. Such raptures in my beating bosom rise, I deem it sure a vision of the skies. Thus, whilst Aurora mounts her purple throne, This is the morning of the fortieth day; for part of the eighteenth book, and the whole nineteenth, and so far of the twentieth book, contain no more time than the evening of the thirty ninth day. In audible laments she breathes her moan: The sounds assault Ulysses' wakeful ear; Mis-judging of the cause, a sudden fear I was at a loss for an explication of this line, 'till I found it in Eustathius; for why should Ulysses imagine that Penelope knew him to be Ulysses, after a speech that express'd so much concern for his absence? Ulysses, having only heard the voice, not distinguish'd the words of her lamentation, mistakes the tears of Penelope for tears of joy; he suspects that the discovery is made by Euryclea or Telemachus; that they have told her the truth to give her comfort; and fears lest in the transport of her joy she should act something that would betray him to the Suitors, and prevent his designs: He therefore immediately withdraws, and makes a pray'r to Heav'n for a sign to re-assure his hopes, that he may proceed with confidence to their destruction. Of his arrival known, the Chief alarms; He thinks the Queen is rushing to his arms. Up-springing from his couch, with active haste The fleece and carpet in the dome he plac'd: (The hide, without imbib'd the morning air.) And thus the Gods invok'd, with ardent pray'r. Jove, and ethereal thrones! with heav'n to friend The construction in the Greek is ungrammatical, for after ??? ????? in the singular, the Poet immediately adds ?? ?? ????????? in the plural number; ?? ????? are imply'd, says Eustathius, so that ???? is understood, which rectifies the construction. The Reader will fully understand the import of this Prayer, from the nature of Omens, and the notions of them amongst the Antients: If, says Ulysses, my prayer is heard, let there be a voice from within the palace to certify me of it; and immediately a voice is heard, O Jupiter, may this day be the last to the Suitors! Such speeches as fell accidentally from any person were held ominous, and one of the antient ways of divination: Ulysses understands it as such, and accepts the Omen. It was in use among the Romans, as appears from Tully of divination, when P. Æmilius was going to war with Perseus King of the Macedonians, he found his little daughter in tears: O Father, says she, Perseus is dead! meaning her little dog named Perseus; Æmilius immediately reply'd, O Daughter I embrace the Omen, applying it to Perseus King of the Macedonians; who was afterwards conquer'd by him, and died a Captive in Rome. The same practice was us'd by the Hebrews, it was call'd Bath Kol; this is an instance of it: Two Rabbies desiring to see Samuel a Babylonish doctor, let us follow said they, the hearing of Bath Kol; travelling therefore near a school, they heard a boy reading these words out of Samuel xxv. 1. And Samuel died. They observ'd it, and found that their Friend was dead. The Sortes Virgilianæ afterwards were much of this kind. If the long series of my woes shall end; Of human race now rising from repose, Let one a blissful omen here disclose: The construction in the Greek is ungrammatical, for after ??? ????? in the singular, the Poet immediately adds ?? ?? ????????? in the plural number; ?? ????? ???????? are imply'd, says Eustathius, so that ???? is understood, which rectifies the construction.

Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above. Whilst lowly thus the Chief adoring bows, The pitying God his guardian aid avows. Loud from a saphire sky his thunder sounds: It was this circumstance, of thunder bursting from a serene sky, that made it ominous: it was noted as such amongst the Romans in the books of the Augurs; and Horace brings it as a proof against the opinions of Epicurus. ? Diespiter Igni corusco nubila dividens, Plerumque per purum tonantes Egit equos, volucremque currum. Virgil likewise speaks of thunder as ominous, when Anchises saw the lambent flame round the head of Iulus: He prays to Jupiter and immediately it thunders. Vix ea fatus erat senior, subitoque fragore Intonuit. The Stoics drew an argument from thunder from a serene air against the Doctrines of Epicurus, who taught that the Gods had no regard of human affairs; for they concluded such thunder to be præter-natural, and an argument of a divine Providence. With springing hope the Heroe's heart rebounds. Soon, with consummate joy to crown his pray'r, An omen'd Voice invades his ravish'd ear. Beneath a pile that close the dome adjoin'd, Twelve female slaves the gift of Ceres grind; This little particularity shews us the great profusion of the Suitors, who employ'd twelve mills to find them bread. There is a particular energy in the word ??????????; it denotes the great labour and assiduity of these people in preparing the bread, and consequently the great waste of the Suitors. It likewise preserves a piece of antiquity, that Kings formerly had mills in their palaces to provide for their families, and that these mills were attended by women; I suppose because preparing bread was an houshold care, and therefore fell to the lot of female servants. Task'd for the royal board to bolt the bran From the pure flour (the growth and strength of man) Discharging to the day the labour due, Now early to repose the rest withdrew; One maid, unequal to the task assign'd, Still turn'd the toilsome mill with anxious mind; And thus in bitterness of soul divin'd. Father of Gods and men! whose thunders rowl O'er the Cerulean Vault, and shake the Pole; Whoe'er from heav'n has gain'd this rare Ostent, (Of granted vows a certain signal sent) In this blest moment of accepted pray'r Piteous, regard a wretch consum'd with care! Instant, O Jove! confound the Suitor train, For whom o'er-toil'd I grind the golden grain: Far from this dome the lewd devourers cast, And be this festival decreed their last! Big with their doom denounc'd in earth and sky, Ulysses' heart dilates with secret joy. Mean-time the menial train with unctuous wood Heap'd high the genial hearth, Vulcanian food: When, early dress'd, advanc'd the royal heir; With manly grasp he wav'd a martial spear, A radiant sabre grac'd his purple zone, And on his foot the golden sandal shone. His steps impetuous to the portal press'd; And Euryclea thus he there address'd. Say thou, to whom my youth its nurture owes, Was care for due refection, and repose, Bestow'd the stranger guest? Or waits he griev'd, His age not honour'd, nor his wants reliev'd? Promiscuous grace on all the Queen confers; This speech of Telemachus may seem to be wanting in filial respect, as it appears to condemn the conduct of his mother: But (remarks Eustathius) the contrary is to be gathered from it. His blame is really a commendation; it shews that her affection was so great for Ulysses, that she receiv'd every vagrant honourably, who deceiv'd her with false news about him; and that other persons who brought no tydings of him, tho' men of greater worth, were less acceptable. (In woes bewilder'd, oft the wisest errs.) The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires, And modest worth with noble scorn retires. She thus: O cease that ever-honour'd name To blemish now; it ill deserves your blame: A bowl of gen'rous wine suffic'd the guest; In vain the Queen the night-refection prest; Nor wou'd he court repose in downy state, Unbless'd, abandon'd to the rage of fate! A hide beneath the portico was spread, And fleecy skins compos'd an humble bed: A downy carpet cast with duteous care, Secur'd him from the keen nocturnal air. His cornel javelin pois'd, with regal port, To the sage Greeks conven'd in Themis' court, It was customary for Kings and Magistrates to go early every morning into the public assemblies, to distribute justice, and take care of public affairs: but this assembly contributing nothing to the action of the Odyssey, the Poet passes it over in a cursory manner, without any enlargement. Eustathius. Forth-issuing from the dome the Prince repair'd: Two dogs of chace, a lion-hearted guard, Behind him sow'rly stalk'd. Without delay The dame divides the labour of the day; Thus urging to the toil the menial train. What marks of luxury the marble stain! Its wonted lustre let the floor regain; The seats with purple cloathe in order due; And let th' abstersive sponge the board renew: The table was not antiently cover'd with linen, but carefully cleans'd with wet sponges. Thus Arrian, ???? ??? ????????, ?????????: And Martial: Hæc tibi sorte datur tergendis spongia mensis. They made use of no napkins to wipe their hands, but the soft and fine part of the bread, which they called ????????????, which afterwards they threw to the dogs; this custom is mention'd in the Odyssey, lib. 10. ?? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ????? ???????? ????? ???????, ?? ?? ??? ?? ????? ?????????? ?????. As from some feast a man returning late, His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate, Rejoicing round, some morsel to receive, Such as the good man ever wont to give. The morsel in the translation, and the ?????????? in the Greek, mean these pieces of bread, or ????????????, with which the Antients wip'd their hands after eating, and then threw to the dogs. Let some refresh the vase's sullied mold; Some bid the goblets boast their native gold: Some to the spring, with each a jar, repair, And copious waters pure for bathing bear: Dispatch! for soon the Suitors will assay The lunar feast-rites to the God of day. This was the last day of one month, and the first of the following: The Greek months were lunar, the first day of every month was a day of great solemnity; and it was consecrated to Apollo, the author and fountain of light. Ulysses had said, lib. 14. v. 186. E're the next moon increase, or this decay, His antient realms Ulysses shall survey; In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn. ??? ??? ????????? ?????, ??? ?? ??????????. This, says Solon in Plutarch, means that Ulysses shall return on the last day of the month precisely; and here we find it verify'd. Ulysses discovers himself upon this day, and kills the Suitors: By his return, in the foregoing period, is meant his discovery; for he was return'd when he made that assertion to Eumæus. It is therefore probable, that the above recited verse was rightly interpreted by Solon. She said; with duteous haste a bevy fair Of twenty virgins to the spring repair: With varied toils the rest adorn the dome. Magnificent, and blithe, the Suitors come. Some wield the sounding ax; the dodder'd oaks Divide, obedient to the forceful strokes. Soon from the fount, with each a brimming urn, (Eumæus in their train) the maids return. Three porkers for the feast, all brawny chin'd, He brought; the choicest of the tusky kind: In lodgments first secure his care he view'd, Then to the King this friendly speech renew'd: Now say sincere, my guest! the Suitor train Still treat thy worth with lordly dull disdain; Or speaks their deed a bounteous mind humane? Some pitying God (Ulysses sad reply'd) With vollied vengeance blast their tow'ring pride! No conscious blush, no sense of right restrains The tides of lust that swell their boiling veins: From vice to vice their appetites are tost, All cheaply sated at another's cost! While thus the Chief his woes indignant told, Melanthius, master of the bearded fold, The goodliest goats of all the royal herd Spontaneous to the Suitors' feast preferr'd: Two grooms assistant bore the victims bound; With quav'ring cries the vaulted roofs resound: And to the Chief austere, aloud began The wretch unfriendly to the race of man. Here, vagrant, still? offensive to my Lords! Blows have more energy than airy words; Those arguments I'll use: nor conscious shame, Nor threats, thy bold intrusion will reclaim. On this high feast the meanest vulgar boast A plenteous board! Hence! seek another host! Rejoinder to the churl the King disdain'd, But shook his head, and rising wrath restrain'd. From Cephalenia cross the surgy main Philætius late arriv'd, a faithful swain. A steer ungrateful to the bull's embrace, And goats he brought, the pride of all their race; Imported in a shallop not his own: To understand this passage, it is necessary to remember that Melanthius and Philætius fed their flocks and herds in Cephalenia, an adjacent Island, under the dominion of Ulysses; but living in different parts of it, they are brought over in separate vessels, by different ferrymen, ????????, as Homer expresses it. The dome re-echo'd to their mingled moan. Strait to the guardian of the bristly kind He thus began, benevolent of mind. What guest is he, of such majestic air? His lineage and paternal clime declare: Dim thro' th' eclipse of fate, the rays divine Of sovereign state with faded splendor shine. If Monarchs by the Gods are plung'd in woe, This is the reasoning of Philætius: Kings are in a peculiar manner the care of the Gods; and if the Gods exempt not Kings from calamities, how can inferior persons (says Dacier) expect to be exempted, or complain in the day of adversity? But I persuade my self the words have a deeper sense, and mean Ulysses; “Well may vagrants suffer, when Kings, such as Ulysses, are not free from afflictions. To what abyss are we foredoom'd to go! Then affable he thus the Chief address'd, Whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he press'd. Stranger! may fate a milder aspect shew, And spin thy future with a whiter clue! O Jove! for ever deaf to human cries; These words are to be ascribed to the excess of sorrow which Philætius feels for the sufferings of Ulysses; for they certainly transgress the bounds of reason. But if we consider the state of Theology in Homer's time, the sentence will appear less offensive; How can Jupiter (says Philætius) who is our father, throw his children into such an abyss of misery? Thou, oh Jove, hast made us, yet hast no compassion when we suffer.” It is no easy matter to answer this argument from the heathen Theology, and no wonder therefore if it confounds the reason of Philætius; but we who have certain hopes of a future state, can readily solve the difficulty: that state will be a time of retribution; it will amply recompense the good man for all his calamities, or as Milton expresses, Will justify the ways of God to men. It may be observ'd in general that this introduction of Philætius and his speech, so warm in the cause of Ulysses, is inserted here with admirable judgment; The Poet intends to make use of his assistance in the destruction of the Suitors; he therefore brings him in giving Ulysses full assurance of his fidelity; so that when that Heroe reveals himself to him, he does not depart from his cautious character, being before certify'd of his honesty. I will only add that Philætius is not to be look'd upon as a common servant, but as an officer of state and dignity: and whatever has been said in these annotations concerning Eumæus may be apply'd to Philætius; he is here call'd ??????? ??????, a title of honour, and Ulysses promises to marry him into his own family in the sequel of the Odyssey; consequently he is a personage worthy to be an actor in Epic Poetry. The tyrant, not the father of the skies! Unpiteous of the race thy will began, The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man, With penury, contempt, repulse, and care, The gauling load of life is doom'd to bear. Ulysses from his state a wand'rer still, Upbraids thy pow'r, thy wisdom, or thy will: O Monarch ever dear!—O man of woe!— Fresh flow my tears, and shall for ever flow! The words in the original are ????? ?? ??????, and they are very differently explain'd by Dacier and Eustathius: ?????, ????? ????? ??????, ????????, “I have sweated and been in an agony at the thought of the severe dispensations of Jupiter;” this is the interpretation of Eustathius. Dacier takes ????? to be an adjective, and then it must be connected with the preceding period. ??? ????????? ??????, ???? ?? ??????? ?????, ??????????? ????????, ??? ?????? ???????????, ????? ?? ??????. Ut privatim, vel domestico admonitus sum exemplo, for so we may render ?????, meaning Ulysses; then the sense will be this; Jupiter, tho' thou hast made us, thou hast no compassion upon mankind, thou castest us into evils and misery; as I have learn'd by a private or domestic instance, namely in the person of Ulysses. If my judgment were of any weight, I should recommend this interpretation rather than that of Eustathius, which seems to be a forced one, and I remember no instance of this nature in Homer; but the preference is submitted to the Reader's decision. Like thee, poor stranger guest, deny'd his home! Like thee, in rags obscene decreed to roam! Or haply perish'd on some distant coast, In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost! O, grateful for the good his bounty gave, I'll grieve, 'till sorrow sink me to the grave! His kind protecting hand my youth preferr'd, The regent of his Cephalenian herd: With vast increase beneath my care it spreads, A stately breed! and blackens far the meads. Constrain'd, the choicest beeves I thence import, To cram these cormorants that crowd his court: Who in partition seek his realm to share; Nor human right, nor wrath divine revere. Since here resolv'd oppressive these reside, Contending doubts my anxious heart divide: Now, to some foreign clime inclin'd to fly, And with the royal herd protection buy: Then, happier thoughts return the nodding scale, Light mounts despair, alternate hopes prevail: In op'ning prospects of ideal joy, My King returns; the proud Usurpers die. To whom the Chief: In thy capacious mind Since daring zeal with cool debate is join'd; Attend a deed already ripe in fate: Attest, oh Jove, the truth I now relate! This sacred truth attest each genial pow'r, Who bless the board, and guard this friendly bow'r! Before thou quit the dome (nor long delay) Thy wish produc'd in act, with pleas'd survey, Thy wond'ring eyes shall view: his rightful reign By arms avow'd Ulysses shall regain, And to the shades devote the Suitor-train. O Jove supreme, the raptur'd swain replies, With deeds consummate soon the promis'd joys! These aged nerves with new-born vigor strung, In that blest cause shou'd emulate the young— Assents Eumæus to the pray'r addrest; And equal ardors fire his loyal breast. Mean-time the Suitors urge the Prince's fate, And deathful arts employ the dire debate: When in his airy tour, the bird of Jove Truss'd with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove; Sinister to their hope! This omen ey'd Amphinomus, who thus presaging cry'd. It may be ask'd why Amphinomus gives this interpretation to the Prodigy? and why might not the Eagle denote the Suitors, and the Pigeon Telemachus? No doubt but such an interpretation would have been specious, but contrary to the rules of Augury. The Eagle is the King of birds, and must therefore of necessity denote the chief personage, and consequently could only be apply'd to Ulysses, or Telemachus. Amphinomus thus interprets it, and the Suitors acquiesce in his interpretation. The Gods from force and fraud the Prince defend; O Peers! the sanguinary scheme suspend: Your future thought let sable Fate employ; And give the present hour to genial joy. From council strait th'assenting peerage ceas'd, And in the dome prepar'd the genial feast. The Antients, says Eustathius, observe that this is the only place where the Suitors offer any Sacrifice throughout the whole Odyssey, and that there is no instance at all, that they make any prayer to the Gods. But is it evident from this place, that this is a Sacrifice? 'tis true the sacrificial term of ??????? is mention'd; but perhaps that word may not denote a Sacrifice; for ??????, tho' it primarily signifies the flesh of animals offer'd to the Gods, yet in a less proper acceptation implies the flesh of all animals indifferently. Thus Athenæus, ??????, ??? ??? ??????? ???????, which must be render'd, the flesh of young animals. Thus, Lib. 7. ??????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????, the flesh of animals that are kill'd by night soonest putrify; and Galen uses ???, and ???????, for an animal indiscriminately. The reason is, because originally no animal was ever slain but some part of it was offer'd to the Gods, and in this sense every ??? was ???????. If we consult the context in Homer, it must be allowed that there is no other word but ??????? that distinguishes this from a common repast, thro' the whole description; and if that word will bear a remote signification, as ??????? does, I should conclude, that this is no Sacrifice. Nay, if it should be found that ??????? implies of necessity a religious act, yet it will not prove that this is more than a customary meal, since the Antients at all entertainments made Libations to the Gods; What may seem to strengthen this conjecture is that the Poet immediately adds, that the Greeks, ??????, sacrific'd in the grove of Apollo; without mentioning that the Suitors partook in the sacrifice: nay they seem to be feasting in the palace, while the Greeks are offering in the grove. Dis-rob'd, their vests apart in order lay, Then all with speed succinct the victims slay: With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled, And the proud steer was on the marble spread. With fire prepar'd they deal the morsels round, Wine rosy-bright the brimming goblets crown'd, By sage Eumæus born: the purple tide Melanthius from an ample jar supply'd: High canisters of bread Philætius plac'd; And eager all devour the rich repast. Dispos'd apart, Ulysses shares the treat! A trivet-table, and ignobler seat, This circumstance is not inserted unnecessarily; the table is suitable to the disguise of Ulysses, and it might have created a jealousy in the Suitors if Telemachus had us'd him with greater distinction. The Prince appoints; but to his Sire assigns The tasteful inwards, and nectareous wines. Partake my guest, he cry'd, without controul The social feast, and drain the cheering bowl: Dread not the railer's laugh, nor ruffian's rage; No vulgar roof protects thy honour'd age; This dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be, From my great Sire too soon devolv'd to me! Your violence and scorn, ye Suitors cease, Lest arms avenge the violated peace. Aw'd by the Prince, so haughty, brave, and young, Rage gnaw'd the lip, amazement chain'd the tongue. Be patient, Peers! at length Antinous cries; The threats of vain imperious youth despise: Wou'd Jove permit the meditated blow, That stream of eloquence shou'd cease to flow. Without reply vouchsaf'd, Antinous ceas'd: Mean-while the pomp of festival increas'd: By Heralds rank'd, in marshall'd order move The city-tribes, to pleas'd Apollo's grove: Beneath the verdure of which awful shade, The lunar hetacomb they grateful laid; Partook the sacred feast, and ritual honours paid. But the rich banquet in the dome prepar'd, (An humble side-board set) Ulysses shar'd. Observant of the Prince's high behest, His menial train attend the stranger guest; Whom Pallas with unpard'ning fury fir'd, By lordly pride and keen reproach inspir'd. A Samian Peer, more studious than the rest Of vice, who teem'd with many a dead-born jest; And urg'd, for title to a consort Queen, Unnumber'd acres arable and green; (Ctesippus nam'd) this Lord Ulysses ey'd, And thus burst out, imposthumate with pride. The sentence I propose, ye Peers, attend: Since due regard must wait the Prince's friend, Let each a token of esteem bestow: This gift acquits the dear respect I owe; With which he nobly may discharge his seat, And pay the menials for the master's treat. He said; and of the steer before him plac'd, That sinewy fragment at Ulysses cast, Where to the pastern-bone by nerves combin'd, The well-horn'd foot indissolubly join'd; Which whizzing high, the wall unseemly sign'd. The Chief indignant grins a ghastly smile; The Expression in Greek is remarkable: ? ??????? ?? ???? ????????? (or ????????? Some tells us that there is an herb frequent in the island of Sardinia, which by tasting distorts the muscles, that a man seems to laugh while he is under a painful agony; and from hence the Sardinian laugh became a Proverb, to signify a laugh which conceal'd an inward pain. Others refer the expression to an antient custom of the Sardinians (a colony of the Lacedemonians) it is pretended that upon a certain festival every year, they not only slew all their prisoners of war, but also all the old men that were above seventy, and oblig'd these miserable wretches to laugh while they underwent the severity of torment. Either of these reasons fully explains the meaning of the ????????? ?????; and shews it to denote an exterior laugh, and an inward pain. I am inclin'd to prefer the former interpretation, not only as it appears most natural, but because Virgil seems to understand it in that sense, for he alludes to the above-mention'd quality of the Sardinian Herbs, Eclogue 7. v. 41. Immo ego Sardois videor tibi amarior herbis ? deform'd like him who chaws Sardinian herbage to contract his jaws. The Reader may observe that Ctesippus breaks out into buffoonry, and the Suitors frequently are guilty of it in other parts of the Odyssey: These levities have been proscrib'd by the Critics as too low, and unworthy of Epic Poetry: but Homer adapts himself to his characters, he paints ridiculous, men in ridiculous colours; tho' I will not say but such characters are more proper for Comedy than Epic Poetry. If ever they are pardonable, they are in Homer, who puts these low pleasantries into the mouths of drunkards and debauchees; such persons being generally men of no worth or serious deportment. Revenge and scorn within his bosom boil: When thus the Prince with pious rage inflam'd: Had not th'inglorious wound thy malice aim'd Fall'n guiltless of the mark, my certain spear Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear: Nor shou'd thy Sire a Queen his daughter boast, The Suitor now had vanish'd in a ghost: No more, ye lewd Compeers, with lawless pow'r Invade my dome, my herds and flocks devour: For genuine worth, of age mature to know, My grape shall redden, and my harvest grow. Or if each other's wrongs ye still support, With rapes and riot to profane my court; What single arm with numbers can contend? On me let all your lifted swords descend, And with my life such vile dishonours end. A long cessation of discourse ensu'd, By gentler Agelaus thus renew'd. A just reproof, ye Peers! your rage restrain From the protected guest, and menial train: And Prince! to stop the source of future ill, Assent your self, and gain the royal will. Whilst hope prevail'd to see your Sire restor'd, Of right the Queen refus'd a second Lord: But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate, To think he still survives to claim the state? Now press the sovereign Dame with warm desire To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire: The Lord selected to the nuptial joys, Far hence will lead the long-contended prize: Whilst in paternal pomp, with plenty blest, You reign, of this imperial dome possest. Sage and serene Telemachus replies; It is observable that Telemachus swears by the sorrows of his father; an expression, in my judgment, very noble, and at the same time, fuil of a filial tenderness. This was an antient custom amongst the Orientals, as appears from an oath not unlike it in Genesis xxxi. 53. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. But how is this speech to be understood? for how can Telemachus persuade his mother to marry, when he knows that Ulysses is return'd? There is a conceal'd and an apparent meaning in the expression. Telemachus, observes Eustathius, swears that he will not hinder his mother from taking an husband, but he means Ulysses: the words therefore are ambiguous, and the ambiguity deceives the Suitors, who believe that by this oath Telemachus obliges himself not only not to hinder, but promote the intended nuptials. By him at whose behest the thunder flies! And by the name on earth I most revere, By great Ulysses, and his woes I swear! (Who never must review his dear domain; Inroll'd, perhaps, in Pluto's dreary train.) Whene'er her choice the royal Dame avows, My bridal gifts shall load the future spouse: But from this dome my Parent-Queen to chase!— From me, ye Gods! avert such dire disgrace. But Pallas clouds with intellectual gloom The Suitors souls, insensate of their doom! A mirthful phrenzy seiz'd the fated crow'd; It is in the Greek, They laugh'd with other mens cheeks. There are many explications of this passage: Eustathius imagines it to denote a feign'd and pretended laughter. Erasmus explains it, non libenter neque ex animo ridere, sed ita ridere quasi non tuis, sed alienis maxillis rideas. But if we consult the conduct of the Suitors, a contrary interpretation will seem to be necessary: for this laughter of the Suitors appears to be very real, and from the heart. Homer calls it ???????? excessive, inextinguish'd; and again, ??? ????????, or they laugh'd with joy, suaviter riserunt; which expressions denote a real and unfeign'd laughter. But how will the words be brought to bear this construction? Very naturally: They laugh'd as if they had borrow'd their cheeks, as if their cheeks were not their own, and consequently they were not afraid to use them with licence and excess; (such persons as the Suitors having no regard for any thing that belongs to another.) Horace makes use of the same expression, Cum rapies in jus, malis ridentem alienis. And likewise Valerius: Errantesque genæ, atque alieno gaudia vultu. This is the opinion of Dacier: But there are some lines in the Greek that make it doubtful; for immediately after the expression of laughing with other mens cheeks, Homer adds, that their eyes flow'd with tears, and sorrow seiz'd their Souls. 'Tis true, Homer describes the Suitors under an alienation of mind, and a sudden distraction occasion'd by Minerva; and from hence we may gather the reason why they are tost by so sudden a transition to contrary passions, from laughter to tears; this moment they laugh extravagantly, and the next they weep with equal excess: persons in such a condition being liable to such vicissitudes. The roofs resound with causeless laughter loud: Floating in gore, portentous to survey! This is to be look'd upon as a prodigy, the belief of which was established in the old world, and consequently, whether true or false, may be allow'd to have a place in Poetry. See Book XII Annot. 32. In the following speech of Theoclymenus there is a beautiful enthusiasm of Poetry; but how are we to understand that Theoclymenus sees these wonders, when they are invisible to all the Suitors? Theoclymenus was a Prophet, and speaks of things future as present; it is the eye of the Prophet that sees these events, and the language of prophecy that speaks of them as present. Thus when he says he sees the palace red with blood, and throng'd with ghosts; he anticipates the event, which is verify'd in the approaching death of the Suitors. Eustathius is of opinion that by the last words of this speech Theoclymenus intends to express an Eclipse of the sun; this being the day of the new moon, when eclipses happen. Others understand by it the death of the Suitors, as when we say the sun is forever gone down upon the dead: Theocritus uses that expression, ????????? ????? ???????? ?????. Homer means by it, that the Suitors shall never more behold the light of the sun. ? ?????? ?? ??????? ????????? ? So far Eustathius. It may be added that the Roman Poets used the same expression in this latter signification. Thus Catullus. Nobis, quùm semel occidit brevis lux, Nox est perpetua una dormienda, Either of these expositions makes the passage intelligible. In each discolour'd vase the viands lay: Then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow, And sudden sighs precede approaching woe. In vision rap'd; the Theoclymenus. Hyperesian Seer Up-rose, and thus divin'd the vengeance near. O race to death devote! with Stygian shade Each destin'd Peer impending Fates invade: With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drown'd; With sanguine drops the walls are rubied round: Thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts, To people Orcus, and the burning coasts! Nor gives the Sun his golden orb to rowl But universal night usurps the pole! Yet warn'd in vain, with laughter loud elate The Peers reproach the sure Divine of Fate; And thus Eurymachus: The dotard's mind To ev'ry sense is lost, to reason blind: Swift from the dome conduct the slave away; Let him in open air behold the day. The Suitors taking the prediction of Theoclymenus literally, viz. I see you all involv'd in darkness, think him distracted, not conceiving his words to be a prophecy; and therefore by way of derision command him to be carry'd into a place of publick resort, that he may convince himself it is full day. Eustathius imagines, they intended to reproach him with drunkenness, because it makes all objects appear indistinct and different from the reality: He quotes a pleasant expression of Anacharsis to this purpose: A certain person telling him at an entertainment that he had married a very ugly woman; I think so too, replies Anacharsis; but fill me a Bumper, that I may make her a beauty. Tax not, (the heav'n-illumin'd Seer rejoin'd) Eustathius explains the answer of Theoclymenus to be both pleasant and serious: “I have eyes, and therefore have no occasion for a guide to lead me from the palace; I have ears, and therefore hear that my absence is desir'd; I have both my feet, and therefore am able to go away without giving others the trouble to assist me; and I have an understanding well inform'd, by which I see the evil that threatens the Suitors, and haste away to avoid it. Of rage, or folly, my prophetic mind, No clouds of error dim th' etherial rays, Her equal pow'r each faithful sense obeys. Unguided hence my trembling steps I bend, Far hence, before yon' hov'ring deaths descend; Lest the ripe harvest of revenge begun, I share the doom ye Suitors cannot shun. This said, to sage Piræus sped the Seer, His honour'd host, a welcome inmate there. O'er the protracted feast the Suitors sit, And aim to wound the Prince with pointless wit: Cries one, with scornful leer and mimic voice, Thy charity we praise, but not thy choice; Why such profusion of indulgence shown To this poor, tim'rous, toil-detesting drone? That other feeds on planetary schemes, And pays his host with hideous noon-day dreams. But, Prince! for once at least believe a friend, To some Sicilian mart these courtiers send, It is evident from this passage that the name of Sicily is very antient, and Eustathius makes the following remark upon it: That the reason why the Poet never mentions this word in describing the wandrings of Ulysses which happen chiefly near Sicily, is to make his Poetry more surprising and marvellous; and that the more to countenance those fabulous relations and miracles which he has told to the Pheacians, he chuses to speak of it by names less known, and less familiar to his Readers. Dacier observes from Bochart, that this island received the name of Sicily from the Phœnicians, long before the birth of Homer, or the war of Troy: Siclul in their language signifies perfection; they call'd it the Isle of perfection, because it held the chief rank amongst all the islands in the Mediterranean: “It is the largest and best island in all our seas,” says Strabo. It has likewise been thought to have taken its name from the Syrian language, namely from Segol, or Segul, a Raisin. For long before the vine was known in Afric, Sicily was famous for its Vineyards, and from thence the Carthaginians imported their raisins and wines. Homer celebrates this island for its vines in the 9th Odyssey. Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour, And Jove descends in each prolific show'r. It is likewise probable from this passage, that the Sicilians traded in slaves; for their lands were fertil, and they merchandiz'd for them to manure the ground. I should rather think that they were remarkable for their barbarity to their slaves; the Suitors speaking by way of terror to intimidate Theoclymenus; and the expression seems to bear the same import with that concerning Echetus, we will send him to Echetus, or the Sicilians, who will use him with the utmost cruelty. Where, if they yield their freight across the main Dear sell the slaves! demand no greater gain. Thus jovial they; but nought the Prince replies; Full on his Sire he rowl'd his ardent eyes; Impatient strait to flesh his virgin-sword, From the wise Chief he waits the deathful word. Nigh in her bright alcove, the pensive Queen The word in the original is ??????, and signifies a large seat that would hold two persons, from ??? ??????. This circumstance (observes Eustathius) is not inserted in vain: the Poet describes Penelope thus seated, that she might see and hear the actions and designs of the Suitors, in order to form her conduct according to the occasion: Now for instance, she perceives their insolence risen to such an height, that she dares make no further delay, but immediately proclaims herself the prize of the best Archer: And this naturally connects the story with the next book. To see the circle sat, of all unseen. Sated at length they rise, and bid prepare An eve-repast, with equal cost and care: But vengeful Pallas with preventing speed A feast proportion'd to their crimes decreed; A feast of death! the feasters doom'd to bleed! THE TWENTY-FIRST BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The bending of Ulysses's bow. Penelope, to put an end to the sollicitation of the Suitors, proposes to marry the person who should first bend the bow of Ulysses, and shoot thro' the ringlets. After their attempts have prov'd ineffectual, Ulysses taking Eumæus and Philætius apart, discovers himself to them; then returning, desires leave to try his strength at the bow, which, tho' refus'd with indignation by the Suitors, Penelope and Telemachus cause it to be deliver'd to his hands. He bends it immediately, and shoots thro' all the rings. Jupiter in the same instant thunders from Heav'n; Ulysses accepts the Omen, and gives a sign to Telemachus, who stands ready arm'd at his side. This book is entitled ????? ?????, or the proposition of the Bow: This action of Penelope has given occasion of raillery both to modern and antient Critics; they insinuate that she propos'd this exercise of the bow to try the strength of her gallants, determining to have regard to that single qualification in the choice of her husband. Penelope vires juvenum tentabat in arcu, Qui latus argueret, corneus arcus erat. They interpret ?????? ????????? into a sense very contrary to the character of Penelope. 'Tis true, other Authors have directly charged her with Inchastity, and affirm that she had a son named Pan, because all the Suitors had a share in him. Lycophron calls her ???????? ?????? ?????????????. It is the exercise of the Bow that has occasion'd these imputations; for none of Homer's Commentators have given the reason why she proposes that exercise in particular; and therefore seeing no reason for it, they have invented a false one, and give the story a ridiculous air: I flatter my self that a better solution may be found out, and a reason given why Penelope proposes this exercise in particular, and preferably to any other. We are to remember that this day was sacred to Apollo; this is evident from the preceding book, where the Ithacans offer an Hecatomb in a grove consecrated to that Deity: The diversion suits the day, the exercise of the bow being proper to be practis'd on the festival of that Deity, who is the patron of it. Several of the titles of Apollo are derived from it; ????????, ??????????, ????????????. It is strange that this necessary observation should escape the notice of all Commentators. If any thing further were wanting to reconcile us to the conduct of Penelope in proposing the Bow, an instance almost parallel to it might be produc'd from History. When Cambyses was preparing to make war against Æthiopia, the King of that country bent his great bow with two fingers in the presence of the Persian Ambassadors, and unbending it again, deliver'd it to them with these words: That when the Persians could do the like, they might hope to conquer the Æthiopians. There is nothing more absurd in the delivery of the bow to the Suitors by Penelope, than in the same act of the Æthiopian King to the Persian Ambassadors. And Pallas now, to raise the rivals fires, With her own art Penelope inspires: Who now can bend Ulysses bow, and wing The well-aim'd arrow thro' the distant ring, Shall end the strife, and win th'imperial dame; But Discord and black Death await the game! The prudent Queen the lofty stair ascends, At distance due a virgin-train attends; A brazen key she held, the handle turn'd, The numerous particularities and digressive Histories crowded together in the beginning of this book have not escaped censure. The Poet very circumstantially describes the key, and the make of it, as likewise the bow and quiver, then tells us who gave it to Ulysses; at the mention of the donor's name he starts into a little History of him, and returns not in many lines to his subject; he then no less circumstantially describes the chamber, and the frame of the door, he descends to every particular of Penelope's opening it, and every step and motion she takes till she produces the bow before the Suitors. This conduct has been liable to objection, as made up of particulars of small importance, to no propos'd end. But notwithstanding, every circumstance is not without its effect and beauty, and nothing better shews the power of the Poet's diction. So great a Critic as Vida admir'd this very passage. Poetic. lib. 2. Ipsa procos etiam ut jussit certare sagittis Penelope, optatas promittens callida tædas Victori, per quanta moræ dispendia mentes Suspensas trahit, ante viri quam proferet arcum? The Poet adapts his verse to the nature of his subject; the description loiters, to express the studied delay of Penelope, and her unwillingness to bring affairs to a decision. However I will not promise that these digressions and antient histories will please every Reader; the passage is so far from being faulty, that it is really an instance of Homer's judgment; yet every thing that is not a fault, is not a beauty. The case is, Penelope proposes the tryal of the bow, merely to protract time from the nuptials; she is slow in producing it for the same reason; and Homer, to paint this slowness in a lively manner, lets the subject of the Poem stand still, and wanders out of the way, that he may not come too soon to the end of his journey. With steel and polish'd elephant adorn'd: Swift to the inmost room she bent her way, Where safe repos'd the royal treasures lay; There shone high-heap'd the labour'd brass and ore, And there the bow which great Ulysses bore, And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept Those winged deaths that many a matron wept. This gift, long since when Sparta's shores he trod, On young Ulysses Iphitus bestow'd: Beneath Orsilochus his roof they meet; One loss was private, one a publick debt: Messena's state from Ithaca detains It has been disputed whether Messene here was a city or a country; Strabo affirms it to be a country, lib. 8. It was a port of Laconia, under the dominion of Menelaus in the time of the war of Troy; and then (continues that Author) the city named Messene was not built. Pausanias is of the same opinion, lib. 4. c. 1. “Before the battle of Leuctra between the Thebans and Lacedæmonians, it is my judgment that there was no City call'd Messene; this is evident from the words of Homer, ?? ?? ??????? ????????? ????????? ???? ?? ??????????. Now Ortilochus lived in Pheræ, a city of Messenia, and consequently Ulysses and Iphitus meeting at his Palace in Messenia, Homer must mean the country, not the city. That Ortilochus lived in Pheræ, appears from the third Odyssey. ?? ????? ?? ?????? ???????? ???? ????, ?)???? ??????????. This Iphitus was the son of Eurytus mention'd in the eighth book, famous for his skill in archery. Vain Eurytus! whose art became his crime, Swept from the earth, he perish'd in his prime, Sudden th' irremeable way he trod, Who boldly durst defy the Bowyer God. So that even this digression is not foreign to the purpose: The Poet largely describes the bow, being to make great use of it in the sequel of the Odyssey: he shews it was originally in the possession of Eurytus, the most famous archer in the world: Nay, this very digression may appear to be absolutely necessary; it being requisite to describe that bow, as of no common excellence and strength, which was not to be drawn by any of the Suitors; and at the same time it sets off the strength of the Heroe of the Poem, who alone is able to bend it. Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains; It has been observ'd in a former annotation, that such ravages or pyracies were not only lawful but honourable amongst the Antients; why then is Ulysses here sent to redemand the spoils made by the Messenians? Dacier answers that such inroads were not allowable except in open War; she means between Greeks and Greeks; for they themselves exercis'd such pyracies with impunity against other nations. And to the youthful Prince to urge the laws, The King and Elders trust their common cause. But Iphitus employ'd on other cares, Search'd the wide country for his wand'ring mares, And mules, the strongest of the lab'ring kind; Hapless to search! more hapless still to find! For journeying on to Hercules at length, The lawless wretch, the man of brutal strength, Deaf to Heav'n's voice, the social rite transgrest; Homer very solemnly condemns this action of Hercules in slaying Iphitus; and some Authors (remarks Eustathius) defend him by saying, he was seiz'd with madness, and threw Iphitus down from the top of his Palace; but this is contrary to Homer, and to the sentiment of those who write that Hercules was deliver'd as a slave to Omphale, for the expiation of the murder of Iphitus. But what chiefly wants explication is the expression ? ???? ???????? ?????? ?. That is, he paid no reverence to his Table. The Table was held sacred by the Antients, by means of which, honour was paid to the God of Friendship and Hospitality: it was therefore a crime to dishonour it by any indecent behaviour. To this purpose Juvenal: Hic verbis nullus pudor; aut reverentia mensæ. The statutes of the Gods were rais'd upon the tables, they were consecrated by placing on them salt, which was always esteem'd holy, and by offering libations to the Gods from them: the Table therefore is call'd in Plutarch ?????? ???? ?????, ??? ??????, the altar of the Gods of Friendship and Hospitality; and therefore to have eaten at the same table, was esteem'd an inviolable obligation of friendship: And ???????? ???????????, to transgress against the table, a breach of the laws of hospitality, and the blackest of crimes. I will only add that it was customary upon making an alliance of hospitality to give mutual Tokens; thus Ulysses here presents Iphitus with a sword and spear; Iphitus Ulysses with a bow. And the producing these tokens was a recognition of the covenant of hospitality, between the persons themselves, and their descendents in following generations. And for the beauteous mares destroy'd his guest. He gave the bow; and on Ulysses' part Receiv'd a pointed sword and missile dart: Of luckless friendship on a foreign shore Their first, last pledges! for they met no more. The bow, bequeath'd by this unhappy hand, Ulysses bore not from his native land, Nor in the front of battle taught to bend, But kept, in dear memorial of his friend. Now gently winding up the fair ascent, By many an easy step, the matron went; Then o'er the pavement glides with grace divine, (With polish'd oak the level pavements shine) The folding gates a dazling light display'd, With pomp of various architrave o'erlay'd. The bolt, obedient to the silken string, Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring; The wards respondent to the key turn round; The bars fall back; the flying valves resound; Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring, This description presents us with a noble image; Homer introduces it to shew the largeness and strength of the door, which resounds as it opens. This exalts a trifling circumstance into sublimity and dignity, and renders a common action poetical; not unlike that in the 24th of the Iliad. Wide as appears some palace-gate display'd, So broad his pinions stretch'd their ample shade. So roar'd the lock when it releas'd the spring. She moves majestic thro' the wealthy room, Where treasur'd garments cast a rich perfume; There from the column where aloft it hung, Reach'd, in its splendid case, the bow unstrung: Across her knees she lay'd the well-known bow, The Bow recalls to her mind the thought of her husband, and this raises her sorrows. The least trifle that once belong'd to a belov'd person, is sufficient to cast a cloud over the soul, which naturally falls in a show'r of tears: And no doubt the exercise which the Suitors are to practise with the Bow, upon which her future fate depends, aggravates her sorrows; she weeps not only for the loss of Ulysses, but at the thought that she is ready to enter upon second nuptials, contrary to her inclinations, And pensive sate, and tears began to flow. To full satiety of grief she mourns, Then silent, to the joyous hall returns, To the proud Suitors bears in pensive state Th' unbended bow, and arrows wing'd with Fate. Behind, her train the polish'd coffer brings, Which held th' alternate brass and silver rings, Full in the portal the chaste Queen appears, And with her veil conceals the coming tears: On either side awaits a virgin fair; While thus the matron, with majestic air. Say you, whom these forbidden walls inclose, For whom my victims bleed, my vintage flows; If these neglected, faded charms can move? Or is it but a vain pretence, you love? If I the prize, if me you seek to wife, Hear the conditions, and commence the strife. Who first Ulysses' wond'rous bow shall bend, And thro' twelve ringlets the fleet arrow send, Him will I follow, and forsake my home, For him forsake this lov'd, this wealthy dome, Long, long the scene of all my past delight, And still to last, the vision of my night! Graceful she said, and bade Eumæus show The rival peers the ringlets and the bow. From his full eyes the tears unbidden spring, Touch'd at the dear memorials of his King. Philætius too relents, but secret shed The tender drops. Antinous saw, and said. Hence to your fields, ye rusticks! hence away, Nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day; Nor to the royal heart recall in vain The sad remembrance of a perish'd man. Enough her precious tears already flow— Or share the feast with due respect, or go To weep abroad, and leave to us the bow: No vulgar task! Ill suits this courtly crew That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew. I well remember (for I gaz'd him o'er While yet a child) what majesty he bore! And still (all infant as I was) retain The port, the strength, the grandeur of the man! He said, but in his soul fond joys arise, And his proud hopes already win the prize. To speed the flying shaft thro' every ring, Wretch! is not thine: the arrows of the King Shall end those hopes, and fate is on the wing! Then thus Telemachus. Some God I find This speech is not without greater obscurity than is usual in so clear a writer as Homer. M. Dacier has done it justice, and clearly opened the sense of it in her paraphrase. “Surely, says Telemachus, Jupiter has disorder'd my understanding: I see my mother, wise as she is, preparing to leave the palace, and enter upon a second marriage; and yet in these melancholy circumstances, I think of nothing but diverting my self, and being an idle spectator of this exercise of the Bow: No, no, this is not to be suffer'd: You (the Suitors) use your utmost efforts to rob me of Penelope, I will therefore use mine to retain her: A woman the most excellent in any nation. But why do I praise her? you know her worth; use therefore no pretext to defer the tryal of the Bow, that we may come to an issue; I will try the Bow with you; and if I succeed, then I will retain her as the prize of the conquest; then she shall not be obliged to second nuptials: Nor will Penelope abandon a son, who emulating his father, is (like him) able to bear the prize from so many Antagonists. This is the true meaning of the words of Telemachus; the diction indeed is somewhat embarrass'd, and the connections a little obscure; but this is done by the Poet, to express the disorder and hurry of mind in Telemachus, who fears for the fate of Penelope: Therefore the connection of the Periods is interrupted, to represent Telemachus starting thro' eagerness of spirit from thought to thought, without order or regularity. With pleasing phrenzy has possess'd my mind; When a lov'd mother threatens to depart, Why with this ill-tim'd gladness leaps my heart? Come then ye Suitors! and dispute a prize Richer than all th' Achaian state supplies, Than all proud Argos, or Mycæna knows, Than all our Isles or Continents enclose: A woman matchless, and almost divine, Fit for the praise of ev'ry tongue but mine. No more excuses then, no more delay; Haste to the tryal—Lo! I lead the way. I too may try, and if this arm can wing The feather'd arrow thro' the destin'd ring, Then if no happy'r Knight the conquest boast, I shall not sorrow for a mother lost; But blest in her, possess these arms alone, Heir of my Father's strength, as well as throne. He spoke; then rising, his broad sword unbound, And cast his purple garment on the ground. A trench he open'd; in a line he plac'd The level axes, and the points made fast. (His perfect skill the wond'ring gazers ey'd, The game as yet unseen, as yet untry'd.) Then, with a manly pace, he took his stand; And grasp'd the bow, and twang'd it in his hand. Three times, with beating heart, he made essay; Three times, unequal to the task gave way: A modest boldness on his cheek appear'd; And thrice he hop'd, and thrice again he fear'd. The fourth had drawn it. The great Sire with joy It is not apparent at the first view why Ulysses prohibits Telemachus from drawing the Bow; but Eustathius gives sufficient reason for this conduct: It would have defeated his whole design, and render'd the death of the Suitors impracticable; for Telemachus had declar'd that he would retain Penelope, if he succeeded in the exercise of the Bow; and this of necessity would create an immediate contest between that Heroe and the Suitors, and bring matters unseasonably to extremity. The same Author assigns a second reason; Ulysses fears lest Telemachus by bending the Bow should make it more supple and flexible, and therefore commands him to desist, lest it should be drawn by the Suitors; besides, if he had drawn it, it would have raisd an emulation amongst them, and they would have apply'd the utmost of their abilities not to be outdone by so young a person as Telemachus; but his despair to effect it, makes them less sollicitous, the tryal being equally unsuccessful to them all. It may also be observ'd that there is a very happy address made to Telemachus by Homer; He shews us that he could have drawn it, but desists in obedience to Ulysses: Thus the Poet has found out a way to give Telemachus the Honour of the Victory without obtaining it; and at the same time shews the superior wisdom of Ulysses, who restrains his son in the heat of his attempt; and makes him by a happy presence of mind at once foresee the danger, and prevent it. Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy. His ardour strait th' obedient Prince supprest, And artful, thus the Suitor-train addrest. Oh lay the cause on youth yet immature! (For heav'n forbid, such weakness should endure) How shall this arm, unequal to the bow, Retort an insult, or repel a foe? But you! whom heav'n with better nerves has blest, Accept the tryal, and the prize contest. He cast the bow before him and apart Against the polish'd quiver propt the dart. Resuming then his seat, Epitheus' son The bold Antinous to the rest begun. “From where the goblet first begins to flow, Antinous makes this proposition, that every person may try his skill without confusion. Perhaps it is propos'd by Antinous by way of Omen, the right hand being reckon'd fortunate: But however that be, it is very evident that in the entertainments of the Antients the cup was deliver'd towards the right hand: hence ???????? came to signify to drink towards the right hand, and Athenæus thus interprets this passage in the first of the Iliad. ? ????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ? Which, remarks that author, signifies ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ???? ???????. And there is express mention made of this practice, Lib. 1. v. 597. of the Iliad. ? ????? ??????? ????? ???????? ? That is, beginning from the right hand, as the scholiast rightly interprets it, Vulcan deliver'd the bowl to all the Gods. This observation explains various passages in many antient authors, as well as in the Iliad and Odyssey: The Custom indeed is not of any great importance, but it is at least a curiosity, and valuable because antient. I doubt not but the bowl out of which these persons drank, would by Antiquaries be thought inestimable; and the possession of an antient bowl is not quite so valuable as the knowledge of an antient custom. “From right to left, in order take the bow; “And prove your several strengths—The Princes heard, And first Leoides, blameless priest, appear'd: The word in the original is ????????, a person who makes predictions from victims or from the smoke of the sacrifice. This Leiodes, the Poet tells us, sate next to the bowl; the reason of it, saith Eustathius, was because the Suitors fear'd left poison should be mix'd in it, and they thought themselves safe thro' his care and inspection: but it may perhaps be a better reason to say, that he sate there in discharge of his office as a prophet, to make libations to the Gods; as was customary at the beginning and end of all entertainments. The Poet adds that this Prophet was placed at the extremity of the apartment; the reason may be because he was an enemy to the insolence of the Suitors, and therefore withdrew from their conversation; or perhaps the word is inserted only to shew that his place was the first (for Eustathius explains ?????????? by ?????? and ?????????) and therefore he was the most proper person to begin the experiment, that the rest might make tryal according as they were seated, successively; and what makes this the more probable is, that the propination always began from the most honourable person. The eldest born of Oenops' noble race, Who next the goblet held his holy place: He, only he of all the Suitor-throng, Their deeds detested, and abjur'd the wrong. With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains, The stubborn horn resisted all his pains! Already in despair he gives it o'er; Take it who will, he cries, I strive no more. What num'rous deaths attend this fatal bow? There is in these words a full and clear prediction of the destruction of the Suitors by the Bow of Ulysses: but what follows, when the Prophet comes to explain himself, renders it ambiguous. Better indeed to die, &amp;c. The next line is very remarkable for the distinction it makes between ????? and ????, soul and spirit: The Reader may turn to the note on Lib. 23. v. 92, 122. of the Iliad; and that on Lib. 11. v. 743. of the Odyssey, where an account is given of the notion of the Antients concerning this division. I shall only here add a passage in St. Paul to the Hebrews, which did not then occur to me, that remarkably falls in with it. The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit. Heb. iv. 12. This Leiodes falls by the sword of Ulysses in the next book; but is it not injustice to take away the life of a Person who is here describ'd as a man of virtue, detesting the actions of the Suitors, and dignify'd with Prophecy? It is easy to answer this objection; he is one of the Suitors to Penelope, as appears from his trying the Bow amongst the rest of them, in order to obtain her in marriage, and consequently he is involv'd in the general crime: This distinguishes his case from that of Medon and Phemius, whom Ulysses spares, it appearing that they made no pretensions to the bed of Penelope, whereas Leiodes endeavours to marry the Queen, which single act would exclude Ulysses from his own bed and dominions. Besides, if we would escape the punishment of wicked men, we must not only detest their crimes, but conversation. What Souls and Spirits shall it send below? Better indeed to die, and fairly give Nature her debt, than disappointed live, With each new sun to some new hope a prey, Yet still to-morrow falser than to-day. How long in vain Penelope we sought? This bow shall ease us of that idle thought, And send us with some humbler wife to live, Whom gold shall gain, or destiny shall give. Thus speaking on the floor the bow he plac'd, (With rich inlay the various floor was grac'd) At distance far the feather'd shaft he throws, And to the seat returns from whence he rose. To him Antinous thus with fury said, What words ill omen'd from thy lips have fled? Thy coward function ever is in fear; Those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear. Why should this bow be fatal to the brave? Because the Priest is born a peaceful slave. Mark then what others can—He ended there, And bade Melanthus a vast pyle prepare; He gives it instant flame: then fast beside Spreads o'er an ample board a bullock's hide. With melted lard they soak the weapon o'er, Chase ev'ry knot, and supple ev'ry pore. This passage has been egregiously misunderstood, and it has been imagin'd that this unguent is to anoint the limbs of the Suitors to make them more supple, after the manner of the Wrestlers who observ'd that custom; but it is very evident that ????? is to be understood in the Greek, and that it is the Bow, not the Limbs of the Suitors, that is to be anointed. Eustathius thus fully explains it: The lard is brought to make the Bow pliant, they chafe it before the fire that the particles of it may enter the pores of the Bow and render it flexible. But Eustathsus falls into an error about the seat that is brought by Melanthius: he imagines the Suitors sate while they drew the Bow, that they might be upon a level with the ringlets which were fix'd upon the ground; whereas in reality the seat is brought, that they may sit while they chafe the Bow. Homer himself says, when Leiodes endeavours to draw it, that he stood up, ????????, and again, He stood, and stepping forward try'd the bow. ??? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???, ??? ????? ?????????? But how is this to be reconcil'd with the conduct of Ulysses, who is directly affirm'd to sit while he draws it? ? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ????????? ? That circumstance is inserted to shew the great strength and dexterity of Ulysses, who is able to draw it in that disadvantageous posture: the Poet in every incident maintains his superiority. Vain all their art, and all their strength as vain; The bow inflexible resists their pain. The force of great Eurymachus alone And bold Antinous, yet untry'd, unknown: Those only now remain'd; but those confest Of all the train the mightiest and the best. Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew, It is wonderful how exactly the Poet observes the distribution of time; he distinctly marks the action of every day, and allots a proper space to every action. In this place the Poem goes forward while Ulysses withdraws to engage the assistance of Philætius and Eumæus. The Suitors are amus'd and employ'd about the Bow, while Ulysses steals away from their observation, and returns without raising their jealousy. The Poet likewise manages the time of the discovery of Ulysses very judiciously; tho' he knew the fidelity of Eumæus and Philætius, yet he trusts them not with the knowledge of his Person, till the very hour of execution; agreeable to the general character of his cautious nature and profound secrecy. But then is not this an imputation to Penelope, that he should chuse to discover himself to these two persons, rather than to his Queen? The answer is, There was a necessity for his discovery to the former, but none to the latter; he wants their assistance in the future engagement, and makes good use of it; whereas a discovery made to the Queen could have been of no advantage, and might possibly have prov'd detrimental; besides, this is a season that requires expedition; and we find Ulysses complies with it, and is very concise in the discovery and interview with Philætius and Eumæus. The Poet therefore reserves the discovery of Ulysses to Penelope to a time of more leisure, that he may dwell upon it more largely, and beautify his Poem with so essential an ornament with greater solemnity. The Masters of the herd and flock withdrew. The King observes them: he the hall forsakes, And, past the limits of the Court, o'ertakes. Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke: Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock! Shall I the secret of my breast conceal, Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell? Say, shou'd some fav'ring God restore again The lost Ulysses to his native reign? How beat your hearts? what aid wou'd you afford? To the proud Suitors, or your antient Lord? Philetius thus. Oh were thy word not vain! Wou'd mighty Jove restore that man again! These aged sinews with new vigor strung In his blest cause shou'd emulate the young. With equal vows Eumæus too implor'd Each pow'r above, with wishes for his Lord. He saw their secret souls, and thus began Those vows the Gods accord: Behold the man! Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain'd By woes and wand'rings from this hapless land: At length he comes; but comes despis'd, unknown, And finding faithful, you, and you alone. All else have cast him from their very thought, Ev'n in their wishes, and their pray'rs, forgot! Hear then, my friends! If Jove this arm succeed, And give yon' impious Revellers to bleed, My care shall be, to bless your future lives With large possessions and with faithful wives; Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend, And each on young Telemachus attend, And each be call'd his brother, and my friend. To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye: Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh, When with Autolychus's sons, of yore, On Parnass' top I chac'd the tusky boar. His ragged vest then drawn aside disclos'd The sign conspicuous, and the scar expos'd: Aristotle treating of the different sort of Remembrances, Chap. 17. of his Poetics, divides them into two kinds, natural or adventitious; the former sort is simple and without art, which Poets use for want of invention; as for instance, when they bring about the discovery of a person by some natural mark or token upon the body: The latter are either marks upon the body, or scars occasion'd by some accident, or tokens distinct from the body, such as the Casket, &amp;c. which Plautus and Terence use in the discovery of several persons in their Comedies: Of this latter kind is this scar of Ulysses; it is an adventitious remembrance, and these remembrances (continues Aristotle) may be used with more or less art: Thus in the case of this wound of Ulysses, it is us'd by Homer in a different way: Euryclea, Lib. 19. describes it accidentally; Ulysses here shews it to Eumæus and Philætius voluntarily; and it is certain that all those marks which a Poet deably and deliberately uses to establish any verity, have less ingenuity than those which produce their effects undeably and casually, and consequently the remembrance in the nineteenth Odyssey is more ingenious than the second discovery. The reason is, it shews no ingenuity to have recourse to such marks, when we have an intention to make the discovery: it causes no surprize nor variety, neither is it produc'd by any art or invention: On the contrary, the other in the nineteenth book arises from the subject, and not from the fancy of the Poet only. But, says Dacier, when Aristotle affirms that this present remembrance wants ingenuity, we are not yet to imagine that he condemns it; for it is a remembrance made by necessity. Ulysses has not opportunity to wait till the discovery is made accidentally, as in the nineteenth Book; he is absolutely compelled to make it deably, to engage Eumæus and Philætius in his cause, by plainly proving to them that he was the real Ulysses. If therefore that Heroe shews less les art in the manner of the remembrance, he shews more wisdom in accommodating his conduct to the opportunity, and using the present conjuncture advantageously, to bring about his own re-establishment. I will only further observe the judgment of Homer in making this discovery with the utmost brevity, concluding it in the compass of two verses: he had before enlarg'd upon the wound, and the reader is already fully instructed in the story: There is likewise another reason that requires conciseness; the urgency of the time demands it, for Ulysses and Eumæus could not be long in conference without observation, and raising the jealousy of the Suitors. Eager they view'd; with joy they stood amaz'd; With tear-full eyes o'er all their master gaz'd: Around his neck their longing arms they cast, His head, his shoulders, and his knees embrac'd: Tears followed tears; no word was in their pow'r, In solemn silence fell the kindly show'r. The King too weeps, the King too grasps their hands, And moveless, as a marble fountain, stands. Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun, But first the wise-man ceas'd, and thus begun. Enough—on other cares your thought imploy, For danger waits on all untimely joy. Full many foes, and fierce, observe us near: Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear. Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay Some moments you, and let me lead the way. To me, neglected as I am, I know The haughty Suitors will deny the bow; But thou, Eumæus, as 'tis born away, Thy master's weapon to his hand convey. At ev'ry portal let some matron wait, This is a very necessary injunction: Ulysses fears not only left any of the Suitors should make his escape but also lest any of the women who were friends to the Suitors should give information to their partisans abroad, and introduce them to their assistance. Eustathius. And each lock fast the well-compacted gate: Close let them keep, whate'er invades their ear; Tho' arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear. To thy strict charge, Philætius! we consign The court's main gate: To guard that pass be thine. This said, he first return'd: the faithful swains At distance follow, as their King ordains. Before the flame Eurymachus now stands, And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands: Still the tough bow unmov'd. The lofty man Sigh'd from his mighty soul, and thus began: I mourn the common cause; for, oh my friends! On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends? Not the lost nuptials can affect me more, No doubt but Eurymachus misrepresents his real sentiments, when he makes the loss of Penelope of little importance; but his conduct is an exact picture of human nature: When we have us'd our utmost endeavours to obtain our desires, and have fail'd in the attempt, the object immediately loses its value, and we would be thought to despise it. To be easy under any disappointment is the result of reason; but to seem to despise what we have been very solicitous to obtain, arises from the pride of our natures, which persuades us to endeavour to cheat the world into an opinion that we have not been disappointed: The remedy for this disease of our minds, is a regular conduct, and to hold the balance even in all our affairs, that the scale be not rais'd too high or depress'd too low. (For Greece has beauteous dames on ev'ry shore) But baffled thus! confess'd so far below Ulysses' strength, as not to bend his bow! How shall all ages our attempt deride? Our weakness scorn? Antinous thus reply'd. Not so, Eurymachus: That no man draws The wond'rous bow, attend another cause. Sacred to Phœbus is the solemn day, Antinous in this reply, speaks, as well as Eurymachus, with dissimulation; he is unwilling to give a true reason, and therefore invents a false one: The true reason why he defers the tryal of the Bow is, because he fears his inability to draw it: The feign'd reason is a pretended piety paid to the day: it was a day to be observ'd religiously, and he insinuates that all sports upon it are a prophanation of it; and consequently, Apollo being provok'd, disables them from drawing the Bow, of which he is the patron. This is the reason why he proposes to offer a libation, to atone for the abuse of the day by their diversions. But perhaps the reason why Antinous defers the exercise of the Bow to the following day, is not because he thought it unlawful to proceed in it on the festival of Apollo; for why should an exercise which was instituted in honour of that Deity, be thought a prophanation of the day? I should therefore rather conclude, that the impiety intended by Antinous, was their omission in not offering a sacrifice to that God before they begun the tryal, that he might prosper their endeavours: The conclusion of his speech makes this opinion probable: “Let us now defer the experiment, and offer sacrifice in the morning to Apollo, that he may give us success in drawing the Bow;” which implies that they were unsuccessful because they had forgot to sacrifice, I will only add that Antinous mentions a goat as an offering to Apollo; we have before seen bulls, sheep and bullocks offered to that Deity; the reason why a goat is a proper victim, I suppose is because he is a rural God, and patron of shepherds, and therefore all kinds of beasts were offer'd to him promiscuously. Which thoughtless we in games would waste away: 'Till the next dawn this ill-tim'd strife forgoe, And here leave fixt the ringlets in a rowe. Now bid the Sew'r approach, and let us join In due libations, and in rites divine, So end our night: Before the day shall spring, The choicest off'rings let Melanthius bring; Let then to Phœbus' name the fatted thighs Feed the rich smokes, high-curling to the skies. So shall the patron of these arts bestow (For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow. They heard well-pleas'd: the ready heralds bring The cleansing waters from the limpid spring: The goblet high with rosie wine they crown'd, In order circling to the peers around. That right compleat, up-rose the thoughtful man, And thus his meditated scheme began. If what I ask your noble minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in the royal love! Chief, if it hurt not great Antinous' ear, (Whose sage decision I with wonder hear) And if Eurymachus the motion please; Give heav'n this day, and rest the bow in peace. To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize, And take it He, the favour'd of the skies! But since 'till then, this tryal you delay, Trust it one moment to my hands to-day: Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes, What once I was, whom wretched you despise; If yet this arm its antient force retain; Or if my woes (a long-continu'd train) And wants and insults, make me less than man? Rage flash'd in lightning from the Suitors eyes, Yet mix'd with terror at the bold emprize. Antinous then: O miserable guest! Is common sense quite banish'd from thy breast? Suffic'd it not within the palace plac'd To sit distinguish'd, with our presence grac'd, Admitted here with Princes to confer, A man unknown, a needy wanderer? To copious wine this insolence we owe, And much thy betters wine can overthrow: The great Eurytion when this frenzy stung, Pirithous' roofs with frantick riot rung; The story of the Centaur is this: Pirithous a Lapithite marrying Hippodamia the daughter of Adrastus, invited the Centaurs and Lapithæ to his nuptials; the Centaurs drinking to great excess, and offering violence to the bride, engag'd them in a quarrel; Eurytion was the person who began the disorder, and the war that ensued became fatal to the whole nation of the Centaurs. Horace alludes to this history. At nequis modici transiliat munera liberi, Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero Debellata ? The Lapithites were a people of Thessaly inhabiting the mountains Pindus and Othrys; the Centaurs were their neighbours, and dwelt in mount Pelion. This war between the Lapithites and the Centaurs probably lasted about a year: for it began on the day of the nuptials of Pirithous, and on the day that his son Polypætes was born, he obtain'd a decisive victory over the Centaurs, and drove them from mount Pelion. Thus lib. 2. v. 900 of the Iliad. Thy troops Argissa, Polypætes leads And Eleon, shelter'd by Olympus' shades; Sprung from Pirithous of immortal race, The fruit of fair Hippodamé's embrace, That day when hurl'd from Pelion's cloudy head To distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled. This history is at large related by Ovid, Metamorph. 12. He calls Eurytion by the name of Eurytus, and describes the nuptial feast in a cave, and not in the palace of Pirithous. Thus Mr. Dryden: In a cool cave's recess the treat was made, Whose entrace trees with spreading boughs o'ershade: There one more brutal of the brutal brood, Or whether wine or beauty fir'd his blood, Or both at once; beheld with lustful eyes The bride, at once, resolv'd to make his prize: Down went the board; and fast'ning on her hair He seiz'd with sudden force the frighted fair: 'Twas Eurytus began.— Boundless the Centaur rag'd; 'till one and all The Heroes rose, and dragg'd him from the hall; His nose they shorten'd, and his ears they slit, And sent him sober'd home, with better wit. Hence with long war the double race was curst, Fatal to all, but to th'aggressor first. Such fate I prophesy our guest attends, If here this interdicted bow he bends: Nor shall these walls such insolence contain; The first fair wind transports him o'er the main; Where Echetus to death the guilty brings, (The worst of mortals, ev'n the worst of Kings) Better than that, if thou approve our chear, Cease the mad strife, and share our bounty here. To this the Queen her just dislike exprest: 'Tis impious, Prince! to harm the stranger-guest, Base to insult who bears a suppliant's name, And some respect Telemachus may claim. What if th'Immortals on the man bestow Sufficient strength to draw the mighty bow? Shall I, a Queen, by rival chiefs ador'd, Accept a wand'ring stranger for my Lord? A hope so idle never touch'd his brain: Then ease your bosoms of a fear so vain. Far be he banish'd from this stately scene Who wrongs his Princess with a thought so mean. O fair! and wisest of so fair a kind! (Respectful thus Eurymachus rejoin'd) Mov'd by no weak surmize, but sense of shame, We dread the all-arraigning voice of Fame; We dread the censure of the meanest slave, The weakest woman: all can wrong the brave. “Behold what wretches to the bed pretend “Of that brave Chief whose bow they cou'd not bend! “In came a Beggar of the strolling crew, “And did what all those Princes could not do. Thus will the common voice our deed defame, And thus posterity upbraid our name. To whom the Queen. If Fame ingage your views, This answer of Penelope is very severe and very just: Eurymachus (observes Dacier) had said, If this beggar draws the bow, we shall lose our reputation: Penelope answers, It is in vain to be sollicitous about your reputation, when your lives are a series of infamous actions: Fame is the reward of good, and shame the portion of base and unworthy deeds: It is no dishonour to a Prince to be surpass'd by a Beggar in strength, but a Prince is more infamous than a Beggar, if his actions betray him to be a worse man; a base action sinks him into contempt, and taints his nobility. The words in Homer are, ?? ??????? ????? ???????; which Eustathius thus explains; Why do you overlook the greater dishonour, and are thus afraid of trifles? and, adds Dacier, the sentiment is just and happy: These Princes place disgrace where it is not; they think it a shame to yield in strength to this stranger, which is really no shame; meer strength is the praise of a beast, not of a Prince: On the contrary, what is really a shame, they think to be none; they prey upon a King, who was a friend to all mankind, they act a thousand insolent and base deeds, and yet apprehend no discredit. This is an unhappy, and I wish it were an unjust, picture of human nature; we deceive our selves with false notions both of shame and glory, and we may apply the words of Terence to this purpose: ? Hic ubi opus est Non verentur: illic ubi opus est ibi verentur. Praise is only to be obtain'd by virtue, and fame is the certain reward of it: Ill-nature or envy may eclipse it, but it will prevail and break out into glory. Forbear those acts which Infamy pursues; Wrong and oppression no renown can raise; Know, Friend! that Virtue is the path to praise. The stature of our guest, his port, his face, Speak him descended from no vulgar race. To him the bow, as he desires, convey; And to his hand if Phœbus give the day, Hence, to reward his merit, he shall bear A two-edg'd faulchion and a shining spear, Embroider'd sandals, a rich cloak and vest, And safe conveyance to his port of rest. O royal mother! ever-honour'd name! Permit me (cries Telemachus) to claim A son's just right. No Grecian Prince but I Has pow'r this bow to grant, or to deny. Of all that Ithaca's rough hills contain, And all wide Elis' courser-breeding plain, To me alone my father's arms descend; And mine alone they are, to give or lend. Retire, oh Queen! thy houshold task resume, This speech has been accus'd of too great a liberty, and as wanting in respect from a son to a mother: Telemachus speaks with authority, when he ought to have shew'd obedience and filial duty. But these Criticks mistake the design and intention of Telemachus; he speaks directly to Penelope, but obliquely and intentionally to the Suitors: It is for this reason that he says he is supreme in the palace, viz. to let them know that he will not give up the sway into their pow'r. He tells Penelope that the Bow shall be used as he directs; this is done to intimidate the Suitors, and prepare the way for the delivery of it to Ulysses, contrary to their injunctions to Eumæus. The verses are the same with those in the 6th of the Iliad. There Hector speaks to Andromache, a tender husband to a fond wife, and the speech was never tax'd with any want of love and kindness. In that place Hector remembers that he is an husband, yet forgets not that he is an Heroe. In this, Telemachus deviates not from the duty of a son, yet speaks in the character and style of a Prince. Eustathius excellently enlarges upon the words of Telemachus: There is an absolute necessity that Penelope should withdraw, that she might not be present at the scene of blood and slaughter. It is for the same reason that the Poet introduces Minerva casting her into a profound sleep, that she might be entirely ignorant of the death of the Suitors: This is absolutely necessary; for if she had been acquainted that Ulysses was return'd, and the Suitors slain by his hand, there could have been no room for the interview between Ulysses and Penelope in the succeeding parts of the Odyssey. But is not Minerva introduc'd upon too small an occasion, only to cast Penelope into a slumber? would not nature have work'd the same effect without the assistance of the Goddess? I have already remark'd that machines are not always used out of necessity, but frequently for ornament, to dignify the Poetry and create surprise by the appearance of a Deity. But here the Poet brings down Minerva, to give credibility to the story; for tho' it be true that nature is sufficient to produce this effect, yet that it should operate in the critical and exact moment, when the Poet has occasion for it, is in some degree incredible: The Poet therefore, to reconcile the relation to probability, introduces a præternatural sleep, occasion'd by the immediate operation of a Goddess. Tend, with thy maids, the labors of the loom; The bow, the darts, and arms of chivalry, These cares to man belong, and most to me. Mature beyond his years, the Queen admir'd Penelope is amaz'd at the free remonstrance of Telemachus; she is ignorant of the reason of it, yet immediately retires, not doubting but his words flow'd from a just cause, and not from a want of filial duty: she is therefore said by the Poet to lodge his words in her memory, waiting till time should unfold the mystery. Dacier. His sage reply, and with her train retir'd: There in her chamber as she set apart, Revolv'd his words, and plac'd them in her heart. On her Ulysses then she fix'd her soul, Down her fair cheek the tears abundant roll, 'Till gentle Pallas, piteous of her cries, In slumber clos'd her silver-streaming eyes. Now thro' the press the bow Eumæus bore, And all was riot, noise, and wild uproar. Hold, lawless rustic! whither wilt thou go? To whom, insensate, dost thou bear the bow? Exil'd for this to some sequester'd den, Far from the sweet society of men, To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made; If heav'n and Phœbus lend the Suitors aid. Thus they. Aghast he laid the weapon down, But bold Telemachus thus urg'd him on. Proceed, false slave, and slight their empty words; What? hopes the fool to please so many lords? Young as I am, thy Prince's vengeful hand Stretch'd forth in wrath, shall drive thee from the land. Oh! could the vigor of this arm as well Th' oppressive Suitors from my walls expell! Then what a shoal of lawless men should go To fill with tumult the dark courts below? The Suitors with a scornful smile survey Spondanus believes they laugh out of contempt of Telemachus; Dacier because they believe the time come which is to end all their doubts by the marriage of Penelope; they hope to draw the Bow, and this hope mollifies their anger. But all these reasons (as well as those of Eustathius) seem to be rather invented than natural: we may find a sufficient reason of their laughter, from the sharpness of Telemachus towards Eumæus; they rejoice to see an enemy (for such they esteem Eumæus) misus'd, and this will likewise give a reason why the Poet adds that they ceas'd their anger against Telemachus, namely, because he gratifies their ill-will by threatning Eumæus. The youth, indulging in the genial day. Eumæus, thus incourag'd, hastes to bring The strife-full bow, and gives it to the King. Old Euryclea calling then aside, Hear what Telemachus enjoyns (he cry'd) It is very evident that this command proceeds not from Telemachus but Ulysses: It was Ulysses who gave directions to shut the door of the womens apartment; but Eumæus is ignorant that Euryclea was acquainted with the return of Ulysses, and therefore speaks as from Telemachus. He knew very well that she would obey the orders of Telemachus, but if she had not been acquainted with the return of Ulysses, she would have made some hesitation, believing the Beggar to be really a stranger and not Ulysses. Eustathius. At ev'ry portal let some matron wait, And each lock fast the well-compacted gate; And if unusual sounds invade their ear, If arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear, Let none to call or issue forth presume, But close attend the labors of the loom. Her prompt obedience on his order waits; Clos'd in an instant were the Palace gates. In the same moment forth Philætius flies, Secures the court, and with a cable tyes The utmost gate. (the cable strongly wrought The word in the Greek is ????????, which we are not to understand of the Ægyptian Papyrus, but it is deriv'd from ????? or ??????, a plant growing in the marshes of Ægypt, ??????? ???????? ??????, that bears the resemblance of the Papyrus, as Eustathius explains it. Of this plant the Antients made their cordage; on the top of it there grew fibrous threads resembling hair, and thus Strabo describes it, ???? ?????? ??? ????? ?????? ??????, a slender twig, bearing, as it were, hair on the top of it. Of Byblos' reed, a ship from Egypt brought) Then unperceiv'd and silent, at the board His seat he takes, his eyes upon his Lord. And now his well-known bow the Master bore, Turn'd on all sides, and view'd it o'er and o'er; This little particularity is not inserted in vain: Ulysses is ready to engage in a terrible combat; it is therefore very necessary to be curious in the examination of the Bow, to be certain that he might depend upon it; if he had observ'd that it had been decay'd thro' time, his prudence would have furnish'd him with some other instrument. Eustathius is of opinion that this whole Bow was made of horn, because ???? denotes worms that breed in horn: The Bow, says that Author, was made of horn, and not of wood, like the Scythian bows. This, it must be confess'd, is not entirely satisfactory, because the bows were antiently tipt or pointed at the extremities with horn; and to this horn Ulysses may refer: But the other opinion is most probable, and Ovid thus understood it: Penelope vires juvenim tentabat in arcu Quæ latus argueret corneus arcus erat. Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong, Its owner absent, and untry'd so long. While some deriding—How he turns the bow! Some other like it sure the man must know, Or else wou'd copy; or in bows he deals; Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals.— Heav'n to this wretch (another cry'd) be kind! And bless, in all to which he stands inclin'd, With such good fortune as he now shall find. Heedless he heard them; but disdain'd reply; The bow perusing with exactest eye. Then, as some heav'nly minstrel, taught to sing Eustathius confesses himself to be greatly pleas'd with this comparison; it is very just, and well suited to the purpose; the strings of the lyre represent the bow-string, and the ease with which the Lyrist stretches them, admirably paints the facility with which Ulysses draws the bow. When similitudes are borrow'd from an object entirely different from the subject which they are brought to illustrate, they give us a double satisfaction, as they surprize us by shewing an agreement between such things in which there seems to be the greatest disagreement. High notes responsive to the trembling string, To some new strain when he adapts the lyre, Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire, Relaxes, strains, and draws them to and fro; So the great Master drew the mighty bow: And drew with ease. One hand aloft display'd The bending horns, and one the string essay'd. From his essaying hand the string let fly The comparison is not intended to represent the sweetness of the sound, but only the quality and nature of it; and means a harsh or jarring sound, or somewhat rough, ????????, as Eustathius interprets it; such a sound as the swallow makes when she sings by starts, and not in one even tenour. The swallow is inharmonious and Aristophanes uses ????????? ??????? in his frogs, to signify those who are enemies to the Muses; and here the Poet uses it to denote a shrill, harsh, or jarring sound. Twang'd short and sharp, like the shrill swallow's cry. A gen'ral horror ran thro' all the race, Sunk was each heart, and pale was ev'ry face. Signs from above ensu'd: the unfolding sky The signal of battle is here given in thunder by Jupiter, as in the eleventh book of the Iliad. Ev'n Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd Red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field. And again, That instant Juno and the martial maid In happy thunders promis'd Greece their aid. This prepares us for the greatness of the following action, which is usher'd in with thunder from heaven: And we are not surpriz'd to see Ulysses defeat his enemies, when Jupiter declares himself in his favour. Homer calls this thunder a sign and a prodigy: It is a sign, because it predicts the event; and a prodigy, because the thunder proceeds from a serene sky. Eustathius. In lightning burst; Jove thunder'd from on high. Fir'd at the call of Heav'n's almighty Lord, He snatch'd the shaft that glitter'd on the board: (Fast by, the rest lay sleeping in the sheath, But soon to fly the messengers of death.) Now sitting as he was, the chord he drew, Thro' ev'ry ringlet levelling his view; Then notch'd the shaft, releast, and gave it wing; The whizzing arrow vanish'd from the string, Sung on direct, and thredded ev'ry ring. The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds; Pierc'd thro' and thro', the solid gate resounds. Then to the Prince. Nor have I wrought thee shame; Nor err'd this hand unfaithful to its aim; Nor prov'd the toil too hard; nor have I lost Ulysses speaks not thus out of vanity, but solely to confirm the courage of Telemachus, and his two friends, Eumæus and Philætius. He sets his vigor before their eyes, that they may have confidence in it in the succeeding engagement. That antient vigor, once my pride and boast. Ill I deserv'd these haughty Peers disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repaste the present hour imploy, This circumstance is very necessary; Ulysses excites the Suitors to supper by day-light, because it would be more easy for him to assault them while they sate at table: the posture would give him some advantage; and he adds before ev'ning, because if they had supp'd by the light of the torch, upon extinguishing it, they had greatly embarrass'd him, and perhaps render'd his designs ineffectual thro' the benefit of the darkness. Neither is it without reason that he proposes singing and music; he does it to draw away their thoughts from any jealousy of intended violence; and by this method he gives the assault unexpectedly, and begins the slaughter before they are prepar'd to make any opposition. Nor wait 'till ev'ning for the genial joy. Then to the lute's soft voice prolong the night, Musick, the banquet's most refin'd delight. He said; then gave a nod; and at the word Telemachus girds on his shining sword. Fast by his father's side he takes his stand; The beamy jav'lin lightens in his hand. THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The Death of the Suitors. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the Suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists, and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumæus and Philætius. Melanthius does the same for the Wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The Suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spar'd. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their Master with all demonstrations of joy. We are now come to the great event or Catastrophe of the Odyssey, which is the Destruction of the Suitors. The manner by which the Poet conducts it, has been prais'd and censur'd, by some as noble and heroic, by others as romantic and incredible: It is therefore highly necessary to vindicate Homer in the chief action of the whole Poem, that he may not be found culpable, in the place where he ought to be the most exact and draw his Heroe to the best advantage. The Objection made against this decisive action is, that the Poet makes Ulysses perform impossibilities; no one person, with such small assistance, being able to destroy above an hundred Enemies. It is no answer to say that Pallas descends to aid Ulysses, for it has been already prov'd, that all incidents which require a divine probability, should be so disengag'd from the action, that they may be substracted from it without destroying it; whereas this action is essential to it. No less a Critic than Longinus, Chap. 7. condemns Homer; for enumerating the faults of the Odyssey, he thus proceeds: “To these may be added the absurdities he commits, in the account of the destruction of Penelope's Suitors.” And Scaliger, Lib. 5. of his Poetics is of the same opinion: Ulysses intersecit arcu procos, inter quos &amp; ipsum tantillum esset intervalli: Quare omnes simul in eum impetum non fecerunt? The strength of this Objection lies in the omission of the Suitors in not rushing at once upon Ulysses in an united Body: Now this was impossible, he stood upon the threshold in a narrow pass, and by this advantage he was able to make it good against a great inequality of numbers. It is not difficult to bring instances of a like nature from undoubted history: Cocles alone defended the bridge over the Tyber against the whole army of Porsena, and stood unmoveable till the Romans broke it down behind him. And Leonidas the Spartan General defended the Pass of Thermopylæ with a small number, against three millions of Persians led by Xerxes; and if he had not been betray'd, he would have probably defeated his whole army. In both these instances there was a greater inequality of numbers, than between Ulysses and the Suitors. The Reader will be reconcil'd to the probability of these relations, if he considers that the whole business of war was antiently decided by mere strength of body: Fire-arms now set all men upon a nearer Level; but in these early ages, the strongest person was the greatest Heroe; a man of superior and uncommon strength drove his enemies before him like an army of boys, and with as much facility. From this observation it is evident that Homer scarce transgresses the bounds of historic truth, when he describes Achilles chasing whole squadrons of Trojans. He wrote according to the manners of his times, and drew after the life, tho' sometimes he improv'd a feature to give grace to the picture of his Heroe: Thus in the Scripture, from the mere advantage of strength, we see a single Goliah defy the whole armies of Israel. Rapin commends the conduct of Homer in bringing about the destruction of the Suitors. The unravelling the whole Odyssey (says that Author) by their Deaths, is very great, and very becoming an Heroe; that whole story is dress'd up in colours so decent, and at the same time so noble, that antiquity can hardly match any part of the narration; here Homer has display'd himself to the best advantage. I wish Rapin had given his reasons, and not run into a general commendation: But we shall be sufficiently convinc'd of the judgment of Homer in describing the Suitors falling chiefly by Ulysses, if we consider the nature of Epic Poetry. The chief action is to be perform'd by the Heroe of the Poem: thus Hector falls by Achilles, Turnus by Æneas: The death of the Suitors is the chief action of the Odyssey, and therefore it is necessarily to be executed by Ulysses; for if any other person had perform'd it, that person would have done an action more noble than the Heroe of the Poem, and eclipsed his glory. It is for the same reason that the Poet refuses all easie methods to re-establish Ulysses: he throws him into difficulties which he is to surmount by his own prowess and magnanimity. Homer might easily have rais'd an army, and plac'd Ulysses at the head of it; but the more difficult way being most conducive to his honour. he rejects all easie methods, shews him struggling with infinite hazards, out of which he extricates himself personally by his wisdom and courage. By these means he compleats the character of his Heroe, leaves a noble image of his worth upon the minds of the Spectators, and makes him go off the stage with the utmost applause. Then fierce the Heroe o'er the threshold strode; Plato was particularly struck with the beauty of these lines: In his Dialogue intituled Iön, p. 145. Socrates thus speaks: “When you repeat the Verses of Homer emphatically, and ravish the whole Audience, whether it be the passage where he sings how Ulysses leaps upon the threshold, discovers himself to the Suitors, and pours his arrows before his feet; or where Achilles rushes upon Hector; or where he paints the Lamentations of Hecuba, Priam, or Andromache; tell me, are you any longer master of your own passions? are you not transported? and ravish'd with divine fury, think your self present at the very actions, either in Ithaca or Troy?” It must indeed be allow'd, that Homer here paints to the Life; we see Ulysses, his motion, his attitude, and the noble fury with which he begins the onset. The Poet interests us in the cause of his Heroe, and we fight on his side against his enemies. Eustathius observes that instead of ????? the Æolians wrote ??????; an observation of too little importance to have been regarded, if he had not given us a fragment of Sappho as a proof of it. ??? ?? ????????? ?????? ???? ??? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??? ??? ??????; ? which he thus explains, What rustic beauty dress'd in awkward charms Detains my lover from his Sappho's arms? The circumstance of throwing the arrows before his feet is not inserted without a reason; Ulysses could reach them from thence with more facility and expedition, than if they had hung at his shoulder in the Quiver. Stript of his rags, he blaz'd out like a God. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver'd deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the ratling show'r he threw, And thus terrific, to the Suitor crew, One vent'rous game this hand has won to-day, Another, Princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phœbus assist! nor be the labour vain, Ulysses addresses a pray'r to Apollo to give success to his present enterprize; he directs it to him, because he is the God of Archery; and he concludes in four words, in compliance with the exigence of the time, which will not permit him to speak at large. This prayer to Apollo confirms my observation, that Penelope propos'd the tryal of the Bow in honour of that Deity, and we find that it was customary from a remarkable passage in the Iliad, Lib. 4. But first to speed thy shaft, address thy vow To Lycian Phœbus with the silver bow; And swear the firstlings of the flock to pay On Zelia's altars, to the God of day. It is from the urgency of the time that the speech of Ulysses, as well as the prayer, is concise: It would have been very injudicious, when he was ready to assault his enemies unexpectedly, to have prefac'd the onset with a long oration; this would have given them an alarm, and time to make an opposition. Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul! High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl; Ev'n then to drain it lengthen'd out his breath; Chang'd to the deep, the bitter draught of death: For Fate who fear'd amidst a feastful band? And Fate to numbers by a single hand. This particular is very artful; the Poet while he writes, seems to be surpriz'd at the difficulty of the enterprize he is about to relate. He is in doubt of the great event, and stands still in admiration of it. This has a double effect; it sets the courage of Ulysses in a strong point of light, who executes what might be almost thought an impossibility; and at the same time it excellently contributes to make the story credible; for Homer appears to be held in suspense by the greatness of the action; an intimation that nothing but the real truth and deference to veracity could extort from him a belief of it: thus by seeming to make the relation improbable, the Poet establishes the probability of it. Eustathius. Full thro' his throat Ulysses' weapon past, And pierc'd the neck. He falls, and breathes his last. The tumbling goblet the wide floor o'erflows, A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose; The word in the original is ?????, which commonly signifies a pipe or musical instrument: The Antients (observes Eustathius) used it to denote a fountain; here therefore it implies a flux or fountain of blood, ??????? ??????????? ???????, the word therefore very happily paints the blood spouting from the Nostrils, as from a fountain; and in this sense, it gives us a full image of the nature of the wound; the blood sprung as from a pipe, through the mouth of the wound, or from the veins, through the nostrils. Grim in convulsive agonies he sprawls: Before him spurn'd, the loaded table falls, And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood Of floating meats, and wine, and human blood. Amaz'd, confounded, as they saw him fall, Uprose the throngs tumultuous round the hall; O'er all the dome they cast a haggard eye, Each look'd for arms in vain; no arms were nigh: Aim'st thou at Princes? (all amaz'd they said) Thy last of games unhappy hast thou play'd; Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed, And death, unlucky guest, attends thy deed. Vulturs shall tear thee—Thus incens'd they spoke, This passage was look'd upon as spurious by the Antients; for they thought it impossible that all the Suitors should speak the same sentiment, as by compact, like a Chorus in a Tragedy: they appeal'd to the custom of Homer himself, who continually wrote ??? ??? ????????. Eustathius answers, that the Poet speaks thus confusedly, to represent the confusion of the Suitors at the death of Antinous. Dacier defends him by saying, that all the Suitors imagin'd that Antinous was slain by accident, and therefore the whole assembly having the same sentiment, the Poet might ascribe to every member of it the same expression. Either of these solutions explains the difficulty. While each to Chance ascrib'd the wond'rous stroke, Blind as they were; for death ev'n now invades His destin'd prey, and wraps them all in shades. Then grimly frowning with a dreadful look, That wither'd all their hearts, Ulysses spoke. Dogs, ye have had your day; ye fear'd no more Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore; The mention of the return of Ulysses from Troy is not inserted casually: He speaks thus to intimidate his enemies, by recalling to their minds all the brave actions that he perform'd before it. Were not this his intention, he would have varied his expression, for in reality he has been absent from Troy near ten years, and returns from the Phæacian, not the Trojan shores. Eustathius. While to your lust and spoil a guardless prey, Our house, our wealth, our helpless handmaids lay: Not so content, with bolder frenzy fir'd, Ev'n to our bed presumptuous you aspir'd: Laws or divine or human fail'd to move, Or shame of men, or dread of Gods above; Heedless alike of infamy or praise, Or Fame's eternal voice in future days: The hour of vengeance, wretches, now is come, Impending Fate is yours, and instant doom. Thus dreadful he. Confus'd the Suitors stood, From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood; Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide, Alone the bold Eurymachus reply'd, If, as thy words import, (he thus began) Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man, Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain'd In thy spoil'd Palace, and exhausted land; The cause and author of those guilty deeds, Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds. Not love, but wild ambition was his guide, To slay thy son, thy kingdoms to divide, This expression is judiciously inserted, and with good reason put into the mouth of one of the Suitors, namely Eurymachus. The Poet is now punishing them for their crimes; it is therefore very necessary that the Reader should be satisfy'd that they deserve punishment; for if it be not an act of justice, it is murder. The Poet therefore brings them all confessing themselves guilty by the mouth of Eurymachus; their crime is the intended murder of Telemachus, and the usurpation of the throne of Ulysses. If this had not been set in a clear light, there might have been room for a suspicion that Ulysses inflicted a punishment too great for the guilt of the Suitors. For was it a crime that deserv'd death, to aim at the marriage of Penelope? this is not to be suppos'd; for they took her to be a widow, and might therefore without a crime ask her in marriage. Was death due for the waste and profusion of the riches of Ulysses? This might have been redress'd, by a full repayment, and a just equivalent. Homer therefore, to shew that there is a cause for the severity of the punishment, sets their crimes in open view, which are an intentional murder, and an actual treason. The place likewise where he inserts this circumstance is well chosen, viz. in the place where the punishment is related; and by this method we acknowledge the equity of it. 'Tis true, Eurymachus throws the guilt upon Antinous as the chief offender; but all the Suitors have been his associates, and approv'd of all his violent and bloody designs thro' the Odyssey, and therefore are justly involv'd in the same punishment; so that Ulysses punishes rebellious subjects by the authority of a King. Homer likewise observes justice in the death of Antinous; he is the first in guilt, and the first that falls by his Heroe's hands. These were his aims, but juster Jove deny'd. Since cold in death th' offender lies; oh spare Thy suppliant people, and receive their pray'r! Brass, gold, and treasures shall the spoil defray, Two hundred oxen ev'ry Prince shall pay: The waste of years refunded in a day. 'Till then thy wrath is just—Ulysses burn'd With high disdain, and sternly thus return'd. All, all the treasures that enrich'd our throne Before your rapines, join'd with all your own, If offer'd, vainly should for mercy call; 'Tis you that offer, and I scorn them all; Your blood is my demand, your lives the prize, 'Till pale as yonder wretch each Suitor lies. Hence with those coward terms; Or fight or fly, This choice is left ye, to resist or die; And die I trust ye shall.—He sternly spoke: With guilty fears the pale assembly shook. Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train: Yon Archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain; But from the threshold shall his darts be sped, (Who-e'er he be) 'till ev'ry Prince lie dead. Be mindful of your selves, draw forth your swords, And to your shafts obtend these ample boards, Eurymachus exhorts the Suitors to make use of the tables to oppose Ulysses in the manner of shields; from whence, observes Eustathius, it may be gather'd that every Suitor had a peculiar table. This may be confirm'd from this book; for when Antinous falls, he overturns a Table; which, if there had been but one, would have been too large to be thus overthrown: besides he speaks in the plural number, ????????. (So need compells.) Then all united strive The bold invader from his post to drive; The City rouz'd shall to our rescue haste, It is impossible but that the Suitors must have many friends amongst the Ithacans. Interest or ill-humour engages men in faction; but this is not the full import of the sense of Homer: The Ithacans were ignorant that Ulysses was return'd, and no wonder therefore if they engag'd in defence of the Princes of their land, against a stranger and a beggar; for such in appearance was Ulysses. And this mad Archer soon have shot his last. Swift as he spoke, he drew his traytor sword, And like a lion rush'd against his Lord: The wary Chief the rushing foe represt, Who met the point, and forc'd it in his breast: His failing hand deserts the lifted sword, And prone he falls extended o'er the board! Before him wide, in mixt effusion roll Th'untasted viands, and the jovial bowl. Full thro' his liver past the mortal wound, With dying rage his forehead beats the ground, He spurn'd the seat with fury as he fell, And the fierce soul to darkness div'd, and hell. Next bold Amphinomus his arm extends To force the pass: the god-like man defends. Thy spear, Telemachus! prevents th' attack, The brazen weapon driving thro' his back, Eustathius, and Spondanus from him, interpret this passage very much to the disadvantage of the courage of Telemachus: They observe that he is yet new to the horrors of war, and therefore wanting the heart to meet his enemy in the front, gives him this wound between the shoulders: That as soon as he has given the blow, out of fear he leaves the spear in the wound; an action as disreputable, as to throw away the shield in battle; and lastly, that it is fear that suggests to his mind the expedient to fetch the arms, a pretext to be distant from danger. But it is not difficult to defend Telemachus. Amphinomus was assaulting Ulysses, and consequently his back was turn'd towards Telemachus, and this occasions the wound in that part. This combat is not a combat of honour, where points of ceremony are observ'd; Telemachus was therefore at liberty to destroy his enemy by any methods, without any imputation of cowardice; especially considering the inequality of the parties. Neither is it out of fear that he quits his spear; but from a dictate of wisdom: he is afraid lest some of the Suitors should attack him while he is disingaging it, and take him at an advantage, while he has no weapon to use in his own defence; besides, he has no farther occasion for it, he hastes away to provide other arms; not only for himself, but for Ulysses and his friends; and this is so far from being the suggestion of fear, that it is the result of wisdom. There is some difficulty in the expression ????????? ?????, the meaning of it is, Lest he should receive a descending blow: The word is an adjective, and Eustathius tells us that ????? is to be understood; I should rather chuse ???????, which immediately precedes, it being as good sense to say, A wound is given by a descending sword, as a descending hand. Thence thro' his breast its bloody passage tore; Flat falls he thund'ring on the marble floor, And his crush'd forehead marks the stone with gore. He left his jav'lin in the dead, for fear The long incumbrance of the weighty spear To the fierce foe advantage might afford, To rush between, and use the shorten'd sword. With speedy ardour to his Sire he flies, And, Arm, great father! arm (in haste he cries) Homer almost constantly gives the epithet ????????? to ????; winged words. Plutarch in his treatise upon Garrulity gives us the meaning of it. A word (says that Author) while it remains unspoken is a secret, but being communicated, it changes its name into common rumour; it is then flown from us; and this is the reason why Homer calls words winged: He that lets a bird fly from his hand, does not easily catch it again; and he that lets a word slip from his tongue cannot recall it; it flies abroad, and flutters from place to place every moment. It has indeed in some passages a still closer meaning; when a person speaks with precipitation, the epithet expresses the swiftness of the speech, the words are wing'd. It is here apply'd with particular propriety; Telemachus asks a question in the compass of four lines, and receives an answer in two from Ulysses; the time not allowing any delay. Lo hence I run for other arms to wield, For missile jav'lins, and for helm and shield; Fast by our side let either faithful swain In arms attend us, and their part sustain. Haste and return (Ulysses made reply) While yet th' auxiliar shafts this hand supply; Lest thus alone, encountred by an host, Driv'n from the gate, th' important pass be lost. With speed Telemachus obeys, and flies Where pil'd on heaps the royal armour lies; Four brazen helmets, eight refulgent spears, And four broad bucklers, to his Sire he bears: At once in brazen Panoply they shone, At once each servant brac'd his armour on; Around their King a faithful guard they stand, While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand: Chief after Chief expir'd at ev'ry wound, And swell'd the bleeding mountain on the ground. Soon as his store of flying fates was spent, Against the wall he set the bow unbent: The Poet may be thought too circumstantial in the disposal of the bow; but there is a reason for it; he shews Ulysses plac'd it out of the reach of the Suitors, who, if they had seized the bow, might have furnished themselves with arrows from the dead bodies of their friends, and employed them against Ulysses: This caution was therefore necessary. Eustathius. And now his shoulders bear the massy shield, And now his hands two beamy jav'lins wield; He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play'd O'er the high crest, and cast a dreadful shade. There stood a window near, whence looking down The word in the Greek is ????????, janua superior, and it is likewise used a little lower. It has given great trouble to the Commentators to explain the situation of these two Passages. Dacier imagines that by the former there was a descent into the court-yard and so to the street; but this cannot be true: For Agelaus exhorting his associates to seize this passage, makes use of the word ???????, which signifies to ascend, and not to descend into the court-yard: Besides, he bids them raise the people by shouting to them, which seems to imply, that this place overlook'd the streets, from whence a shout might be heard by the people. ???????? (observes Eustathius) is ???? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ????? ????? ???????, that is, a door by which a person ascends to obtain a prospect: This probably led to the roof of the porch of the palace fronting the street, from whence a person standing in the open air and shouting might raise the City; or as for greater clearness it is here translated a window, which answers all these purposes. But there is still a difficulty arising from the word ??????, which is thus solved by Eustathius, ????? ????? ? ???? ??? ????????? ???? ????????, that is, a narrow passage leading to this private window or door, and he afterwards interprets it by ????? ????. From what has been observ'd, it appears evidently that there was another passage to the upper apartments of the palace; for this was guarded by Eumæus, and was inaccessible, and consequently Melanthius conveys the arms to the Suitors by some other stair-case. This Homer expresses by ????????? ????????; the former word is very well explained by Hesychius, it signifies the passages of the palace leading from chamber to chamber, or the ?????? of the apartments. ???? properly denotes a rupture, and here represents the openings of the passages from room to room. The Antients thought this whole passage so obscure, that they drew a plan of these inward passages of the palace, as Eustathius informs us; in this they figur'd the porch, the higher aperture, the other stair case, and the room where the arms were laid. But Dacier starts another difficulty: If Melanthius could go up to the room where the arms lay, why could he not go from thence into the courts of the palace, and raise the city? The answer is, because the arms were plac'd in an inward apartment, and there was no passage from thence into the palace-yards. Her mistake arose from her opinion that there was an entry into the palace by the ????????, which opinion is refuted in the beginning of this annotation. If indeed Telemachus had brought down the arms this way, then there must have been a passage for Melanthius to the place from whence Agelaus bids him raise the city; for if Telemachus had passed to the armory by it, why might not Melanthius from it? But this is not the case; for this door or window is not mentioned till Telemachus has furnished Ulysses and his Friends with armour; and consequently Homer cannot intend that we should understand that Telemachus ascended to the armory by it. From o'er the porch, appear'd the subject town. A double strength of valves secur'd the place, A high and narrow, but the only pass: The cautious King, with all-preventing care, To guard that outlet, plac'd Eumæus there: When Agelaus thus: Has none the sense To mount yon window, and alarm from thence The neighbour town? the town shall force the door And this bold Archer soon shall shoot no more. Melanthius then: That outlet to the gate So near adjoins, that one may guard the strait. But other methods of defence remain, My self with arms can furnish all the train; Stores from the royal magazine I bring, And their own darts shall pierce the Prince and King. He said; and mounting up the lofty stairs, Twelve shields, twelve lances, and twelve helmets bears: Aristarchus, remarks Eustathius, blamed this description as incredible; for how could one person be able to carry such a load of armour at one time? But we are not to make this supposition; the Poet speaks indefinitely, and leaves us at liberty to conjecture that Melanthius brought them at several times; thus a little lower we find him going again for arms to furnish the rest of the Suitors. All arm, and sudden round the hall appears A blaze of bucklers, and a wood of spears. The Heroe stands opprest with mighty woe, On ev'ry side he sees the labour grow: Oh curst event! and oh unlook'd-for aid! Melanthius or the women have betray'd— Oh my dear son!—The father with a sigh! Then ceas'd; the filial virtue made reply. Falshood is folly, and 'tis just to own The fault committed; this was mine alone; My haste neglected yonder door to bar, And hence the villain has supply'd their war. Run good Eumæus then, and (what before This passage, where Telemachus bids Eumæus go and see who brings the arms, proves that Telemachus did not before absent himself from the battle out of cowardice; Here he chuses to partake the danger with Ulysses, and sends Eumæus and Philætius to execute his orders; a sign that he does not consult his safety at the expence of his honour. Eustathius. But it may seem extraordinary, that Ulysses and Telemachus should be in doubt to know the person who brought the arms to the Suitors; especially when Agelaus had held a publick conference with Melanthius in order to it; but, answers Eustathius, they spoke with a low voice, and at a proper distance from Ulysses. It may also be objected that Melanthius could not possibly bring the arms without the observation of Ulysses and his friends. To solve this difficulty we must have recourse to the second private door, or ????????, mentioned in a former annotation: by this passage he ascends and descends without a discovery; that passage standing in such a situation, as not to be visible to those who were on the opposite side of the palace. What may seem to contradict this observation is, what Homer afterwards adds, for he directly tells us, that Eumæus observ'd that the person who brought the arms was Melanthius; but that expression may only imply, that he saw Melanthius going from the rest of the company, and hasting toward that ascent, and therefore justly concludes him to be the Person. I thoughtless err'd in) well secure that door: Learn if by female fraud this deed were done, Or (as my thought misgives) by Dolius' son. While yet they spoke, in quest of arms again To the high chamber stole the faithless swain. Not unobserv'd. Eumæus watchful ey'd, And thus address'd Ulysses near his side. The miscreant we suspected takes that way; Him, if this arm be pow'rful, shall I flay? Or drive him hither, to receive the meed From thy own hand, of this detested deed? Not so (reply'd Ulysses) leave him there, For us sufficient is another care: Within the stricture of this palace wall To keep inclos'd his masters till they fall. It may be ask'd, when Eumæus retires from the guard of the passage, what hinders the Suitors from seizing it, and by it giving notice to the city of their danger? What Ulysses here says obviates this objection. He tells Eumæus, that he and Telemachus will defend it against all the efforts of his enemies: By this expression he gives us to understand, that Telemachus shall post himself in the place of Eumæus, and make it good till he has executed justice upon Melanthius. Go you and seize the felon; backward bind His arms and legs, and fix a plank behind; On this, his body by strong cords extend, And on a column near the roof suspend; So study'd tortures his vile days shall end. The ready swains obey'd with joyful haste, Behind the felon unperceiv'd they past, As round the room in quest of arms he goes: (The half-shut door conceal'd his lurking foes) One hand sustain'd a helm, and one the shield We see Melanthius after a diligent search finds only one helm and one shield; and the shield is described as almost spoil'd with age: From hence Eustathius gathers that there were no more left in the armory; for it is probable that Melanthius would not have return'd with so few arms if he could have found more; nor would he have brought the decay'd shield, if he could have supply'd himself with a stronger; so that all the arms of Ulysses were seventeen helmets, twelve at first deliver'd to the Suitors by Melanthius, one more he was now bringing, and Ulysses and his friends were in possession of four: There were the same number of shields, and twenty spears, twelve given to the Suitors, and eight to the assistants of Ulysses. This was his private armory for the defence of his palace: and we are not to conclude, that these were the whole arms of the nation; there probably was a publick repository for armour for the publick use of their armies against their enemies. Which old Laertes wont in youth to wield, Cover'd with dust, with dryness chapt and worn, The brass corroded, and the leather torn: Thus laden, o'er the threshold as he stept, Fierce on the villain from each side they leapt, Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew, And down reluctant on the pavement threw. Active and pleas'd, the zealous swains fulfil At ev'ry point their master's rigid will: First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound, Then streighten'd cords involv'd his body round; So drawn aloft, athwart the column ty'd, The howling felon swung from side to side. Eumæus scoffing, then with keen disdain: There pass thy pleasing night, oh gentle swain! On that soft pillow, from that envy'd height First may'st thou see the springing dawn of light; So timely rise, when morning streaks the east, To drive thy victims to the Suitors feast. This said, they left him, tortur'd as he lay, Secur'd the door, and hasty strode away: Each, breathing death, resum'd his dang'rous post Near great Ulysses; Four against an host. When lo! descending to her Heroe's aid Jove's daughter Pallas, War's triumphant maid: In Mentor's friendly form she join'd his side; Ulysses saw, and thus with transport cry'd, Come, ever welcome, and thy succour lend; Oh ev'ry sacred name in one! my friend! Early we lov'd, and long our loves have grown: What-e'er thro' life's whole series I have done Or good, or grateful, now to mind recall, And aiding this one hour, repay it all. Thus he; but pleasing hopes his bosom warm Of Pallas latent in the friendly form. The adverse host the phantom warrior ey'd, And first loud-threatning, Agelaüs cry'd. Mentor beware, nor let that tongue persuade Thy frantic arm to lend Ulysses aid; Our force successful shall our threat make good, And with the fire's and son's commix thy blood. What hop'st thou here? Thee first the sword shall slay, Then lop thy whole posterity away; Far hence thy banish'd consort shall we send; With his, thy forfeit lands and treasures blend; Thus, and thus only, shalt thou join thy friend. His barb'rous insult ev'n the Goddess fires, Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires. Art thou Ulysses? where then shall we find Pallas is here an allegorical Deity, and represents the courage and wisdom which was exerted by Ulysses in the destruction of the Suitors: The Poet puts the words into the mouth of a Goddess, to give ornament and dignity to his Poetry; but they are only the suggestions of his own heart, which reproaches him for being so slow in punishing the insolence of his adversaries. If we take them in this sense they will be in the nature of a soliloquy: The Poet indeed was obliged to introduce a Deity, to give importance to the decisive action of his whole Poem: Thus Jupiter assists Æneas in Virgil; Minerva, Achilles in the Iliad, and the same Goddess Ulysses here in the Odyssey. I very well know that all these passages have been blam'd by some Critics, as derogatory to the courage of these Heroes, who cannot conquer their enemies but thro' the assistance of a Deity. The Reader may be pleas'd to look back for a full vindication of Homer and Virgil, to Lib. 3. Note 43. of the Odyssey. We may observe that a Deity descends to assist Ulysses, but that the Suitors are left to their own Conduct: This furnishes us with a very just and pious moral, and teaches us that Heaven guards and assists good men in adversity, but abandons the wicked, and lets them perish for their follies. The patient body and the constant mind? That courage, once the Trojans daily dread, Known nine long years, and felt by Heroes dead? And where that conduct, which reveng'd the lust Of Priam's race, and lay'd proud Troy in dust? If this when Helen was the cause, were done, What for thy country now, thy Queen, thy son? Rise then in combat, at my side attend; Observe what vigour Gratitude can lend, And foes how weak, oppos'd against a friend! She spoke; but willing longer to survey The sire and son's great acts, with-held the day; By farther toils decreed the brave to try, And level'd pois'd the wings of Victory: Then with a change of form eludes their sight, Perch'd like a swallow on a rafter's height, We have seen the Deities, both in the Iliad and Odyssey, changing themselves into the shape of birds: thus, Lib. 7. v. 67. of the Iliad, Th' Athenian maid, and glorious God of day With silent joy the settling hosts survey, In form like vulturs, on the beech's height They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight. This perhaps may be the occasion of all such fictions. The superstition of the heathen world induc'd the Antients to believe that the appearance of any Bird in a critical hour, was a sign of the presence of a Divinity, and by degrees they began to persuade themselves, that the Gods appear'd to them in the form of those birds. Hence arose all the honours paid to Augurs, and the reliance upon divination drawn from the flight of birds: and almost every Deity had a bird sacred to him. The Eagle to Jupiter, the Peacock to Juno, &amp;c. Pallas here takes the form of a swallow, because it is a domestic Bird, and therefore may be said to appear within the walls of the palace with most probability, And unperceiv'd, enjoys the rising fight. Damastor's son, bold Agelaus, leads The guilty war; Eurynomus succeeds; With these, Pisander great Polyctor's son, Sage Polybus, and stern Amphimedon, With Demoptolemus: these six survive, The best of all the shafts had left alive. Amidst the carnage desp'rate as they stand, Thus Agelaus rouz'd the lagging band. The hour is come, when yon' fierce man no more With bleeding Princes shall bestrow the floor: Lo! Mentor leaves him with an empty boast; The four remain, but four against an host. Let each at once discharge the deadly dart, One sure of six shall reach Ulysses' heart: Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain: The rest must perish, their great leader slain. Then all at once their mingled lances threw, And thirsty all of one man's blood they flew; In vain! Minerva turn'd them in her breath, And scatter'd short, or wide, the points of death; With deaden'd sound, one on the threshold falls, One strikes the gate, one rings against the walls; The storm past innocent. The godlike man Now loftier trod, and dreadful thus began. 'Tis now (brave friends) our turn, at once to throw (So speed 'em heav'n) our jav'lins at the foe. That impious race to all their past misdeeds Would add our blood. Injustice still proceeds. He spoke: at once their fiery lances flew: Great Demoptolemus, Ulysses slew; Euryades receiv'd the Prince's dart; The Goatherd's quiver'd in Pisander's heart; Fierce Elatus by thine, Eumæus, falls; Their fall in thunder ecchoes round the walls. The rest retreat: the victors now advance, The danger beginning to abate by the fall of the chief of the enemy, Ulysses advances from his stand: There was a necessity for this conduct: Ulysses and his three assistants had kill'd four enemies with their spears; and consequently the Poet was obliged to supply them with fresh weapons, otherwise, if they had discharged their spears once more, they must have been left naked and defenceless, having only two a-piece brought by Telemachus. This observation shews the exactness which Homer maintains in his relation. Each from the dead resumes his bloody lance. Again the foe discharge the steely show'r; Again made frustrate by the virgin pow'r. Some, turn'd by Pallas, on the threshold fall, Some wound the gate, some ring against the wall; Some weak, or pond'rous with the brazen head, Drop harmless, on the pavement sounding dead. Then bold Amphimedon his jav'lin cast; Thy hand Telemachus, it lightly raz'd; And from Ctesippus' arm the spear elanc'd On good Eumæus' shield and shoulder glanc'd; Not lessen'd of their force (so slight the wound) Each sung along, and drop'd upon the ground. Fate doom'd thee next, Eurydamas, to bear Thy death, ennobled by Ulysses' spear. By the bold son Amphimedon was slain: And Polybus renown'd the faithful swain. Pierc'd thro' the breast the rude Ctesippus bled, And thus Philætius gloried o'er the dead. There end thy pompous vaunts, and high disdain; Oh sharp in scandal, voluble and vain! How weak is mortal pride! To heav'n alone Th'event of actions and our fates are known: Scoffer, behold what gratitude we bear: The victim's heel is answer'd with this spear; This refers to a passage in the latter end of the twentieth Book of the Odyssey, where Ctesippus throws the foot of a bullock at Ulysses. Philætius here gives him a mortal wound with his spear, and tells him it is a return for the foot of the bullock. Eustathius informs us that this became a Proverb, ????? ?? ???? ????? ????????, to express a return of evil for evil; the like may be observed of the death of Antinous, who was killed as he lifted the bowl to drink. ????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??? ??????? ?????. Which is exactly render'd by our Proverb, Many things happen between the cup and the lip. Thus likewise the kindness of Cyclops was used proverbially, to denote a severe injury disguised under a seeming civility; that Monster having promis'd Ulysses mercy, but it was only the mercy to devour him last. These little instances prove the great veneration the Antients had for Homer. Ulysses brandish'd high his vengeful steel, And Damastorides that instant fell; Fast by, Leocritus expiring lay, The Prince's jav'lin tore its bloody way Thro' all his bowels: down he tumbles prone, His batter'd front and brains besmear the stone. Now Pallas shines confess'd; aloft she spreads The arm of vengeance o'er their guilty heads; The dreadful Ægis blazes in their eye; This shield is at large describ'd, Lib. 5. of the Iliad. ? round the margin roll'd. A fringe of serpents, hissing, guard the gold: Here all the terrors of grim war appear; Here rages Force, here tremble Flight and Fear; Here storm'd Contention, and here fury frown'd, And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd. We see the terrible effects which the shield causes are created by the Poet into a kind of Beings, and animated to fight on the side of his Heroe. Amaz'd they see, they tremble, and they fly: Confus'd, distracted, thro' the rooms they fling, Like oxen madden'd by the breeze's sting, The fury of the battle being now over, Homer pauses with the action; and letting his fancy rove in search of foreign ornaments, beautifies and enlivens the horrors of it with two similitudes, drawn from subjects very distant from the terrors they are brought to illustrate. The former of an herd of cattle, represents the confusion and affright of the Suitors; the latter of the birds, their weakness and unavailing flight. The Gadfly shews the fury and close pursuit of Ulysses and his assistants, the Hawks their courage, and superior pow'r. Eustathius. Virgil at large describes this Breeze fly. Georg. 3. About th' Alburnian groves, with holly green, Of winged insects mighty swarms are seen: This flying plague, to mark its quality, Oestros the Grecians call, Asylus, we: A fierce loud buzzing Breeze: their stings draw blood; And drive the cattle gadding thro' the wood, Seiz'd with unusual pains they loudly cry, &amp;c. Dryden. This description shews that this is no ill-chosen similitude; it very well paints the Suitors flying in an herd, and Ulysses wounding them as they fly. The latter simile from the Hawks, affords some curiosity in regard to the antient manner of that sport. It is evident, says Dacier, that this passage is an instance, that flying of birds of prey, in the nature of our hawking, was practis'd by the Antients: The nets call'd by Homer ?????, were fix'd in the plain ground; the fowlers with their falcons took their station upon the adjoining eminences; when the birds, driven from this rising ground, flew to the plain, they met with the nets, and endeavouring to escape them, crowded into flocks; Then the Hawk or Vultur was loos'd, and descending upon his prey, slew them in multitudes; for the birds were incapable of resisting, and at the same time were afraid of the nets, and therefore could not escape: This is the reason why the fowlers are said to rejoice at the sport: A plain indication, that the Poet intended to describe the sportman's flying his bird at the prey. That the word ????? signifies Nets, is evident from Aristophanes, ?? ???????, ?? ??????, that is, I swear by my nets: Hesychius is of the same opinion, ?????, says that Author, signifies the Clouds, ??? ???? ????????, Hunters Nets. Eustathius directly affirms, that in his time this sport was practised in many countries; and the place where the nets were fixed was call'd ????????????. That Author construes these words ????? ?????????? ??????, as if ??? were to be understood, to express the rushing of the birds against the net; but there is no occasion for this violence to the text, for by joining ????? with ?????????? the period will be plain, and signify, that thro' fear of the net they fly with violence to avoid it. Monsieur Dacier has a pretty observation upon this sport; and shews us that the Antients were used to take even deer with nets, by flying at them birds of prey, in conformity to this description of Homer: This is manifest from a passage in Arrian, lib. 2. c. 1. where he speaks of men placing their fears where they have nothing to fear: ?????? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????? ??? ????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ?? ?????, ??? ?????????? ??? ???? ???? (?????) ??????????? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??????, ??? ????? ??????????, ??????????? ?? ?????? ??? ??????????; “For what remains, we are like deer, for they fearing the birds that are flown at them, what course do they take? To what place of refuge do they run to be in security? To the nets, and so perish, mistaking their danger for their greatest safety.” Minerva in this similitude is the bird of prey descending from the mountain, for she it is who scatters the Suitors by displaying her Ægis from the roof of the palace: This is the opinion of Eustathius: But in the winding up of the comparison, Homer plainly by the vultur denotes Ulysses and his assistants (tho' perhaps not exclusively of the Goddess) for in the application he writes: ?? ??? ??? ???????? ??????????? ???? ???? ???????. ? When sultry days, and long, succeed the gentle spring. Not half so keen, fierce vulturs of the chace Stoop from the mountains on the feather'd race. When the wide field extended snares beset, With conscious dread they shun the quiv'ring net: No help, no flight; but wounded ev'ry way, Headlong they drop: the fowlers seize the prey. On all sides thus they double wound on wound, In prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground, Unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan, And a red deluge floats the reeking stone. Liodes first before the victor falls: This Liodes is the last person who survives of the Suitors; he was an Augur and a Prophet, and ought therefore to have follow'd wiser counsels: He tells Ulysses that he endeavour'd to restrain the Suitors from their insolence; but he himself aspir'd to the bed of Penelope, and consequently was an associate in their conspiracies. Liodes falls without resistance; and indeed it would have been very improper to have represented him encountring Ulysses in a single combat, when above an hundred had not been able to stand before him: besides, fighting is out of the character of Liodes; he was not a man of the sword, but an Augur: It would therefore have been contrary to his function, to have drawn him engaging Ulysses; and consequently it is with great propriety that he is describ'd falling not as a warrior, but as a suppliant. The wretched Augur thus for mercy calls. O gracious hear, nor let thy suppliant bleed: Still undishonour'd or by word or deed Thy house, for me, remains; by me repress'd Full oft was check'd th' injustice of the rest: Averse they heard me when I counsell'd well, Their hearts were harden'd, and they justly fell. Oh spare an Augur's consecrated head, Nor add the blameless to the guilty dead. Priest as thou art! for that detested band Thy lying prophecies deceiv'd the land: Against Ulysses have thy vows been made; For them, thy daily orisons were paid: Yet more, ev'n to our bed thy pride aspires: One common crime one common fate requires. Thus speaking, from the ground the sword he took Which Agelaus' dying hand forsook; Full thro' his neck the weighty faulchion sped: Along the pavement roll'd the mutt'ring head. Phemius alone the hand of vengeance spar'd, Phemius the sweet, the heav'n-instructed bard. Beside the gate the rev'rend minstrel stands; The lyre, now silent, trembling in his hands; Dubious to supplicate the chief, or fly To Jove's inviolable altar nigh, This altar of Jupiter Hercæus stood in the Palace-yard; so call'd from ?????, the out-wall enclosing the Court-yard. It stood in the open air, where they sacrific'd to Jupiter the Guardian, or Protector; and within the Palace to ???? ?(????????. Jupiter was worshipp'd under the same name by the Romans. Thus Ovid, Cui nihil Hercæi profuit ara Jovis. The Altar mention'd by Virgil, Æneid. 2. was of the same nature: To which Priam fled at the taking of Troy. Uncover'd but by Heav'n, there stood in view An Altar; near the hearth a lawrel grew, Dodder'd with age; whose boughs encompass round The houshold Gods, and shade the holy ground. These Altars were places of sanctuary, and by flying to them the person was thought to be under the immediate protection of the Deity, and therefore in some cases inviolable. The same practice prevail'd amongst the Jews, for we find frequently in the scriptures that it was customary to fly to the Altar as to a place of refuge, which is evident from the expression of laying hold on the horns of the Altar. This is the reason why Phemius entertains an intention to fly to the Altar of Jupiter Hercæus. Plutarch, in his treatise upon Music, informs us, that Demodocus was reported to have wrote a Poem, intitled, The destruction of Troy: And Phemius another, call'd The return of the Grecian Captains: But by these Poets, Homer probably means only himself, who was Author of two Poems, the Iliad, and the Odyssey. Homer (remarks Eustathius) plainly shews us the notion he had of the great qualifications that were necessary to form a good Poet. He must sing of men and Gods: that is, be thoroughly acquainted with all things, both human and divine; he must be ????????????, or self-taught; that is, as we express it, he must be a Genius; he must have a natural ability, which is indeed to be improv'd, but not capable of being learn'd, by study: He adds, that besides this felicity of nature, he must have an heavenly inspiration; this implies that he must have a kind of enthusiasm, an elevation of soul which is not to be obtain'd by labour and industry, and consequently is the gift of heav'n. Thus Pindar, ? ????? ? ???- ?? ????? ???. ???????? ??, ?????? ??????????, ??????? ??, ??????? ????????. The bards, whom true poetic flame inspires, Receive from nature more than human fires; In vain from arts alone they tune the voice, Like crows they croak, nor is it song, but noise. This is the Mens Divinior of Horace: By industry men may become great Scholars and Philosophers; but no man was ever a great Poet, without being in the strictest sense a great Genius. I will only add, that Aristotle in his Rhet. 1. 7. quotes this Hemistic ????????????, &amp;c. as an instance that natural are more excellent than acquir'd abilities; he gives the reason of it; namely, because they are more uncommon, and not to be obtain'd by human industry. Maximus Tyrius has a criticism upon it. How (objects that Author) can it be said that the Poet is self-taught, if the Gods teach him to sing? The answer is easy, Homer means that he has no human instructor, and only opposes natural to acquir'd abilities. It is observable that Maximus Tyrius erroneously quotes the verse. Dissert. 22. for he writes, ???? ?? ??? ?????? ?????, instead of ? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ????? ???????? ???????? ? He likewise puts the words in the mouth of Demodocus, which are here spoken by Phemius; he undoubtedly quoted by memory. What Homer adds after all this, to raise the character of his Poet, is very remarkably moral. That he never turned his talents to flattery, nor was it voluntarily that he served or entertain'd unworthy men, but was merely compell'd to it by their violence. Where oft Laertes holy vows had paid, And oft Ulysses smoking victims laid. His honour'd harp with care he first set down, Between the laver and the silver throne; Then prostrate stretch'd before the dreadful man, Persuasive, thus, with accent soft began. O King! to mercy be thy soul inclin'd, And spare the Poet's ever-gentle kind. A deed like this thy future fame would wrong, For dear to Gods and Men is sacred song. Self-taught I sing; by heav'n, and heav'n alone The genuine seeds of Poesy are sown; And (what the Gods bestow) the lofty lay, To Gods alone, and god-like worth, we pay. Save then the Poet, and thy self reward; 'Tis thine to merit, mine is to record. That here I sung, was force and not desire; This hand reluctant touch'd the warbling wire: And let thy son attest, nor sordid pay Nor servile flatt'ry stain'd the moral lay. The moving words Telemachus attends, His sire approaches, and the bard defends. Oh mix not, Father, with those impious dead The man divine; forbear that sacred head; Medon the herald too our arms may spare, Medon, who made my infancy his care; If yet he breathes, permit thy son to give Thus much to gratitude, and bid him live. Beneath a table, trembling with dismay, Couch'd close to earth, unhappy Medon lay, Wrapt in a new-slain Oxe's ample hide: Swift at the word he cast his skreen aside, Sprung to the Prince, embrac'd his knee with tears, And thus with grateful voice address'd his ears: O Prince! O Friend! lo here thy Medon stands; Ah stop the Heroe's unresisted hands, Incens'd too justly by that impious brood, Whose guilty glories now are set in blood. To whom Ulysses with a pleasing eye: Be bold, on friendshp and my son rely; Live, an example for the world to read, The moral intended to be taught by the fable of the Odyssey is, to shew virtue, tho' long in distress, at length triumphant; and vice, tho' long successful, unfortunate in the conclusion: It is to this effect that Ulysses here speaks; and to give his words more weight, he throws them into a sentence. It is with excellent judgment that it is here plac'd by Homer: The punishment is no sooner over but Ulysses declares the equity of it; he speaks to all mankind, and lays it down as an universal truth that virtue is to be prefer'd before vice, and invites us to the practice of the former, by shewing the success of it in his own victory; and deters us from the latter, by representing the ill consequences of it in the destruction of the Suitors. How much more safe the good than evil deed: Thou, with the heav'n-taught bard, in peace resort From blood and carnage to yon open court: Me other work requires—With tim'rous awe From the dire scene th' exempted two withdraw, Scarce sure of life, look round, and trembling move To the bright altars of Protector Jove. Mean-while Ulysses search'd the dome, to find If yet there live of all th' offending kind. Not one! compleat the bloody tale he found, All steep'd in blood, all gasping on the ground. So, when by hollow shores the fisher train The Antients, remarks Eustathius, observ'd that this is the only place where Homer manifestly speaks of catching fish with nets; For those words, lib. 5. v. 595. of the Iliad, ? and sweep away Sons, Sires, and Wives, an undistinguish'd prey; which in the Greek is express'd by ????? ????? ?????? ????????, may be apply'd to the taking of beasts or birds by nets, and consequently ought not to be appropriated to fishing. Thus it is evident that this art was practis'd very antiently amongst the Grecians; it was likewise known early to the Hebrews and Ægyptians. Thus Isaiah xix. 8. The fishers (of Ægypt) shall mourn, all they that cast the angle into the brook shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. And that they fish'd the seas with nets is evident from Ezekiel xxvi. 5. It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea. The comparison is very just; and the last line of it gives a peculiar honour and distinction to Ulysses: That Heroe is the Sun who kills the Suitors, in application of the similitude. Sweep with their arching nets the hoary main, And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain, All naked of their element, and bare, The fishes pant, and gasp in thinner air; Wide o'er the sands are spread the stiff'ning prey 'Till the warm sun exhales their soul away. And now the King commands his son to call Old Euryclea, to the deathful hall: The son observant not a moment stays; The aged Governess with speed obeys: The sounding portals instant they display; The matron moves, the Prince directs the way. On heaps of death the stern Ulysses stood, All black with dust and cover'd thick with blood. So the grim Lion from the slaughter comes, Eustathius agrees with an observation which has been made concerning the similitudes of the Odyssey, lib. 16. He here remarks that comparisons are as rare in the Odyssey as they are frequent in the Iliad; and that the difference arises from the difference of the subjects: The subject of the Iliad is great, and therefore properly illustrated by noble Images, and a variety of sublime comparisons: The subject of the Odyssey requires to be related in a less exalted style, and with greater simplicity. This Book is an undeniable testimony of the truth of this observation: the story of it approaches nearer to the nature of the Iliad than any other book of the Odyssey, and we find it is more adorn'd with comparisons than almost all the rest of the Poem. Dreadful he glares, and terribly he foams, His breast with marks of carnage painted o'er, His jaws all dropping with the bull's black gore. Soon as her eyes the welcome object met, The guilty fall'n, the mighty deed compleat; A scream of joy her feeble voice essay'd: The Heroe check'd her, and compos'dly said. Woman, experienc'd as thou art, controul Indecent joy, and feast thy secret soul. T'insult the dead is cruel and unjust; The word in the original is ???????, and here signifies a voice of joy. In other places it is used to denote a sorrowful lamentation. See Note 49. of the third Odyssey. I am wonderfully pleas'd with the noble sentiment of Ulysses contained in these lines. It is full of piety and humanity: good-nature feels for the sufferings of any of its fellow-creatures. Even in punishment we are to remember; that those we punish are men, and inflict it as a necessary justice, not as a triumph. Such here is the conduct of Ulysses; he is so far from rejoicing in his success, that he restrains others from it; and seems to be a mourner at the funeral of his enemies. He falls into the same thought with Job xxxi. 29. If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up my self when evil found him, If I suffered my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul, &amp;c. Were a Prince, who makes war for glory, to stand upon a field of battle immediately after victory, amidst the horrors of the dead, and the groans of the dying; it would surely mortify his ambition to see such horrible monuments of his glory. If the death of thousands of brave men were weighed in a scale against a name, a popular empty breath of a multitude, and if reason held the ballance, how easily would the disproportion be discovered? Fate, and their crime, have sunk them to the dust; Nor heeded these the censure of mankind, The good and bad were equal in their mind. There is some obscurity in these words, they neither respected the good nor the bad man; or as Homer expresses it, ?? ????? ???? ??? ??????. A reverence is due to a good man, and consequently it is a crime to deny it; but why should it be objected to the Suitors as a fault that they despis'd the bad man, whose actions deserve to be despis'd? Eustathius answers, ????? may signify ????????, or a person of a low condition, the poor man, or the stranger; and this justifies the assertion: But perhaps the Poet uses it to shew that they despis'd and outrag'd all men universally without distinction, whether persons of probity or dishonesty; they consider'd not the condition of others, but were insolent to all mankind. Justly the price of worthlessness they paid, And each now wails an unlamented shade. But thou sincere! Oh Euryclea, say, What maids dishonour us, and what obey? Then she. In these thy kingly walls remain (My son) full fifty of the handmaid train, Taught by my care to cull the fleece, or weave, And servitude with pleasing tasks deceive; Of these, twice six pursue their wicked way, It is remarkable, observes Monsieur Bayle, that of fifty women, so few as twelve only should yield to the desires of the Suitors. But it is not indeed affirm'd that the rest were ever tempted by any importunities. Plutarch, in his treatise of Education, informs us that Bion wittily apply'd this passage to the study of the sciences: When the Suitors fail'd in their attempts upon Penelope, they condescended to address her maids: so men who are not capable of understanding Philosophy, busy themselves with studies of no value. Nor me nor chast Penelope obey; Nor fits it that Telemachus command This, remarks Eustathius, is an instance of the maternal wisdom of Penelope; and at the same time a vindication of Telemachus for not restraining the insolence and immodesty of these female servants; They were out of his jurisdiction, and immediately under the protection of Penelope. But is not this removal of the fault from Telemachus, an imputation upon the Queen? and if the son wanted an excuse for not punishing their crimes, is the mother unblameable, who not only permits the disorder of their lives, but forbids Telemachus to redress it? Is it to be suppos'd that this chaste matron was more indulgent to female frailty than Telemachus? The true reason is, Telemachus could not, and Penelope durst not, shew a just resentment against these criminals: they had too great an interest in the chief of the Suitors to stand in awe of the Queen, or fear her vengeance. This is evident, for Penelope her self was in a great measure in their power, and the same authority that supported the Suitors in their insolence against the Queen, would support these females against her revenge for their immodesty. (Young as he is) his mother's female band. Hence to the upper chambers let me fly, Where slumbers soft now close the royal eye; There wake her with the news—The matron cry'd; Not so (Ulysses more sedate reply'd) Ulysses gives this injunction, because he is unwilling to wound the eyes of Penelope with a spectacle of such horror as the dead bodies and blood of the Suitors It was indeed necessary to find some reasonable pretext for not introducing the Queen immediately; this might be expected from the fondness and affection of an husband towards a beloved wife, and therefore Ulysses makes even his fondness for her a reason why he delays his discovery, namely, his care not to grieve her with such a terrible scene of slaughter: Besides, the death of the female servants is to succeed, and it would have been indecent to have made her assisting or present at their execution. The Poet reaps a further advantage from this conduct; for by it he introduces the discovery to Penelope, in a time of leisure, and finds an opportunity to describe at large that surprizing and tender incident. Bring first the crew who wrought these guilty deeds. In haste the matron parts: The King proceeds. Now to dispose the dead, the care remains To you, my son, and you, my faithful swains; Th' offending females to that task we doom, To wash, to scent, and purify the room. These (ev'ry table cleans'd, and ev'ry throne, And all the melancholy labour done) It would in these ages, observes Dacier, be thought barbarous in a King to command his son to perform an execution of so much horror: but antiently it was thought no dishonour: Thus in the Scriptures Gideon having taken Zeba and Salmana, two Midian Kings, commands his son to kill them with the sword in his presence: But, continues that Author, I wish Homer had deviated from this custom, that he had given both Ulysses and Telemachus sentiments of more humanity, and spar'd his Reader a description of such a terrible execution. I am not delighted with any thing that has a tendency to Inhumanity more than that Lady; but it may be answer'd, that Homer was obliged to write according to the custom of the age. Virgil has ascrib'd an act more cruel to the pious Æneas, who sacrifices several unfortunate young men who were his captives. Æn. 11. v. 15. Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear; Appointed off'rings in the victor's name, To sprinkle with their blood the funeral flame. Dryden. This act is to be ascribed to the manner of the age, and the customs of war in the days of Æneas, and not to his inhumanity: But here it may seem essential to the very nature of Epic Poetry to relate this act of justice: The moral of it is, to see the good rewarded and the wicked punished, in the conclusion of the Fable. These criminals had been as guilty in their several capacities as the Suitors themselves; it was therefore necessary that their punishment should be set before the Reader, as well as that of the Suitors. Drive to yon' court, without the Palace wall, There the revenging sword shall smite them all; So with the Suitors let them mix in dust, Stretch'd in a long oblivion of their lust. He said: The lamentable train appear, Each vents a groan, and drops a tender tear; Each'd heav'd her mournful burthen, and beneath The porch, depos'd the ghastly heaps of death. The Chief severe, compelling each to move, Urg'd the dire task imperious from above. With thirsty sponge they rub the tables o'er, (The swains unite their toil) the walls, the floor Wash, with th' effusive wave, are purg'd of gore. Once more the palace set in fair array, To the base court the females take their way; There compass'd close between the dome and wall, (Their life's last scene) they trembling wait their fall. Then thus the Prince. To these shall we afford A fate so pure, as by the martial sword? To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame, And base revilers of our house and name? Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung A ship's tough cable, from a column hung; Near the high top he strain'd it strongly round, Whence no contending foot could reach the ground. Their heads above, connected in a row, They beat the air with quiv'ring feet below: Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare, Nothing can better represent to us the Image of these sufferers than this similitude of a bird taken by the neck in a gin or snare. Hobbs in his version has omitted it; and Dacier has abridg'd the whole description. Eustathius is pleasant upon the death of these wantons. What a certain person, says he, once spoke of a fig-tree, on which his clamorous wife had hang'd herself, viz. I wish all trees bore such fruit; may be apply'd to these ropes, It were to be wish'd that all nooses could catch such birds. This remark has escaped the notice of Madam Dacier; because the race of clamorous women has been long extinct, and therefore there was no occasion to prescribe a remedy for a disease unknown to these happy ages. The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air. Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind The empty corse to waver with the wind. Then forth they led Melanthius, and began Their bloody work: They lopp'd away the man, Morsel for dogs! then trimm'd with brazen sheers The wretch, and shorten'd of his nose and ears; His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel: He roar'd, and torments gave his soul to hell— They wash, and to Ulysses take their way, So ends the bloody business of the day. To Euryclea then addrest the King: Bring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring, To purge the palace: then the Queen attend, And let her with her matron-train descend; The matron-train with all the virgin band Assemble here, to learn their Lord's command, Then Euryclea; Joyful I obey, But cast those mean dishonest rags away; Permit me first thy royal robes to bring: Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a King. “Bring sulphur strait and fire (the Monarch cries) The reason why Ulysses orders sulphur to be brought, is, because every thing was thought to be polluted by a dead body, and he uses it by way of purification. The same opinion prevail'd amongst the Hebrews as well as Greeks, as the Scriptures inform us. Thus also in Job it is said, Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation, xviii. 15. which is thought to allude to this custom. Livy mentions this practice amongst the Romans, lib. 30. c. 15. Habet &amp; in religionibus locum ad expiandas suffitu domus. Homer describes the female servants descending with torches; this is done to shew the exact time of the action of this book, which is comprehended in the Evening of the fortieth day. Ulysses forbids Euryclea to bring a better Garment: this little particularity is inserted with judgment; for the disguise of Ulysses in the garb of a beggar contributes to encrease the incredulity of Penelope, and consequently to all those doubts and fears, and that struggle between the love of a Husband and the dread of an Impostor, which are the subject of the succeeding Book. She hears, and at the word obedient flies. With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes, He purg'd the walls and blood-polluted rooms. Again the matron springs with eager pace, And spreads her Lord's return from place to place. They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand, A gazing throng, a torch in ev'ry hand. They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace Each humbly kist his knee, or hand, or face; He knows them all; in all such truth appears, Ev'n he indulges the sweet joy of tears. THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. Euryclea awakens Penelope with the News of Ulysses's return, and the death of the Suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her, but supposes some God has punish'd them, and descends from her apartment in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfy'd. Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the Queen continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinc'd, and falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other all that has past during their long separation. The next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to visit his Father. This book contains the Discovery of Ulysses to Penelope. Monsieur Rapia is very severe upon some parts of it; whose objections I shall here recite. The discovery of Ulysses to his Queen was the most favourable occasion imaginable for the Poet to give us some of the nicest touches of his art; but as he has managed it, it has nothing but faint and weak surprizes, cold and languishing astonishments, and very little of that delicacy and exquisiteness which ought to express a conjugal tenderness: He leaves his wife too long in doubt and distrust, and she is too cautious and circumspect; the formalities she observes in being fully assur'd, and her care to act with security, are set down in number and measure, lest she should fall into any mistake; and this particularity makes the story dull, in a place that so much requires briskness and liveliness. Ought not the secret instinct of her love to have inspir'd her with other sentiments? and should not her heart have told her, what her eyes could not? Love is penetrating, and whispers more to us than the senses can convey; but Homer understood not this Philosophy: Virgil who makes Dido foresee that Æneas designs to leave her, would have made better advantage of this favourable opportunity. The strength of this objection consists chiefly in the long incredulity of Penelope, and the slowness she uses to make an undeniable discovery: This Rapin judges to be contrary to the passion of love, and consequently that the Poet writes unnaturally. There is somewhat of the Frenchman in this Criticism: Homer in his opinion wants vivacity; and if Rapin had been to have drawn Ulysses, we had seen him all transport and extasy. But where there is most fancy, there is often the least judgment. Penelope thought Ulysses to be dead; he had been absent twenty years; and thro' absence and his present disguise, he was another person from that Ulysses whom she knew, when he sail'd to Troy; so that he was become an absolute stranger. From this observation we may appeal to the Reader's judgment, if Penelope, without full conviction, ought to be persuaded that this person was the real Ulysses? And how could she be convinc'd, but by asking many questions, and descending to particularities, which must necessarily occasion delay in the discovery? If indeed Ulysses and Penelope had met after a shorter absence, when one view would have assur'd her that he was her real husband, then too much transport could not have been express'd by the Poet: but this is not the case, she is first to know her Husband, before she could or ought to express her fondness for his return, otherwise she might be in danger of misplacing it upon an impostor: but she is no sooner convinc'd that Ulysses is actually return'd, but she receives him with as much fondness as can be expressed, or as Rapin could require. While yet he speaks, her pow'rs of life decay, She sickens, trembles, falls, and faints away: At length recov'ring, to his arms she flew, And strain'd him close, as to his breast she grew. 'Till this moment the discovery was not evidently made, and her passion would have been unseasonable; but this is no sooner done, but she falls into an agony of affection. If she had here appear'd cool and indifferent, there had been weight in Rapin's objections. Besides Aristotle informs us, there was a Play, call'd, The False Ulysses: It was form'd upon a story of a person who design'd to surprize Penelope, and told her, that he was her husband; and to confirm it, pretended to remember a Bow, which he used before he went to the siege of Troy. This shews that Penelope had been in danger from impostors, and it is therefore very prudent in her to be upon the guard, and not to yield without full conviction. But there is a dispute of a different nature mentioned by Monsieur Bayle; namely, whether if Penelope had yielded to an impostor, believing him to be really Ulysses, she had been guilty of adultery? Monsieur Basnage thus argues: “Let us suppose a wife transported with love for an husband, running eagerly to the person she mistakes for him: This woman has no design to be deceived, one cannot blame her ardor; it is lawful, if he proves her real husband: in short, her ignorance is involuntary, and occasion'd solely by a laudable passion for her husband: Yet, if this person prove an adulterer, is the wife entirely excusable? ought her eagerness and precipitation to give her no uneasiness? undoubtedly it ought, because she is suppos'd to act precipitately, without a full examination: her passion is stronger than her reason, and therefore she is blameable.” The Author of the General Critique on Maimbourg is more indulgent: He judges that if a woman does not refuse a strict examination out of a blameable motive, she is excusable, tho' she happens to oblige an impostor. “If a wife, deceived by the resemblance between her husband and an impostor, shall allow the latter all the privileges of the marriage-bed, this action is no stain to her chastity; and the husband would be the most unreasonable creature breathing, should he blame it as a breach of conjugal fidelity, provided she is no way accessary to the imposition.” So that according to this Author, tho' the wife is betray'd by her precipitation, yet she is to be accounted innocent; because the precipitation is occasion'd by a vehemence of love for her husband. But I fear few husbands who should take their wives in such circumstances would excuse them, or believe that they had us'd due circumspection. In short, Monsieur Bayle rightly decides the question, by saying, that every person who acts precipitately is culpable; and that no person can act rationally, without a full and satisfactory examination. And indeed if this rule were observ'd, there would scarce be any room for the aforesaid supposition. The resemblance between man and man is never so perfect, but the difference upon a strict observation is discernible; we may therefore conclude, that a wife who should suffer such a deceit, was not very unwilling to be deceiv'd; especially when there must be between a man and wife a thousand particularities, which could only be known to the wife and husband, which upon a due scrutiny would discover the imposture. I fear I shall be tedious to the Reader, by mentioning another difficulty of a similar nature started by Seneca. “If any person should make an assignation with his own wife in disguise, supposing her to be the wife of another person, would he be guilty of adultery?” He answers in the affirmative; tho' the wife her self would be innocent; for he is guilty intentionally. This may be illustrated by the example of Jacob, who was blameless when he was deceived by Leah, who personated his wife Rachel; but Leah was culpable, tho' Jacob was innocent, for she very well knew that she was not wife to Jacob. But this is the province of a Casuist, not of a Commentator. Then to the Queen, as in repose she lay, The Nurse with eager rapture speeds her way; The transports of her faithful heart supply A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly. And sleeps my child? the rev'rend matron cries: Ulysses lives! arise, my child, arise! In the Greek it is literally, Ulysses is come, he is at length come to his Palace. This last circumstance is not a tautalogy; for, observes Eustathius, a person may be returned to his country, and yet never arrive at his family: Thus Agamemnon reach'd his dominions in safety, but was assassinated before he came to his Palace. We may observe in general, that Euryclea and Penelope thro' their whole conference speak with brevity; Homer was too good a judge of human nature, to represent them speaking with prolixity. Passion is always in haste, and delivers it self with precipitation; and this is very well painted in this interview: Euryclea is in a transport of joy for the return of Ulysses, and Penelope has all her affections awaken'd at the news of it. At length appears the long-expected hour! Ulysses comes! The Suitors are no more! No more they view the golden light of day; Arise, and bless thee with the glad survey! Touch'd at her words, the mournful Queen rejoin'd, Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind? The righteous pow'rs who tread the starry skies, This is an admirable sentiment: it is consonant to many expressions in the holy Scriptures. God is the Lord of spirits, and gives and takes away as seems best to his infinite wisdom. The thoughts of man, as well as his life, are equally in the power of the Almighty. The weak enlighten and confound the wise, And human thought, with unresisted sway, Depress or raise, enlarge or take away: Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes, And Folly, with the tongue of Wisdom speaks. Unkind, the fond illusion to impose! Was it to flatter, or deride my woes? Never did I a sleep so sweet enjoy, Homer, observes Eustathius, very judiciously mentions this profound sleep of Penelope; for it might have been thought improbable, that she should not wake at the noise and confusion of the battle. It was solely to reconcile it to credibility, that in a preceding book Pallas was introduc'd to throw her into it: besides, the womens apartment was always in the upper part of the house, and was from thence called ???????: and consequently Penelope was at a sufficient distance from the place of the combat, and may be easily suppos'd not to be wak'd by it. The circumstance of Penelope's not being awak'd by the cries of the Suitors, furnishes us with a reason why they are not heard by the Ithacans that liv'd near the Palace: for if she who is within the Palace is not disturb'd by the noise, it is credible enough, that the Greeks who liv'd at some distance from the Palace should not hear it. Since my dear Lord left Ithaca for Troy: Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore? O Troy—may never tongue pronounce thee more! Be gone: another might have felt our rage, But age is sacred, and we spare thy age. To whom with warmth: My soul a lie disdains; Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns: That stranger, patient of the Suitors wrongs, And the rude licence of ungovern'd tongues, He, he is thine! thy son, his latent guest Long knew, but lock'd the secret in his breast; With well-concerted art to end his woes, And burst at once in vengeance of the foes. We are not to gather from this transport of Penelope, that she is fully convinc'd of the return of Ulysses: She is yet incredulous; but she must have been insensible if she had continued unmov'd at the mention of the arrival of an husband, whose return has been describ'd thro' the whole Odyssey as the chief object of all her desires. Besides, she receives the death of the Suitors with joy; she cannot disbelieve the testimony of Euryclea concerning their deaths; but thinking it impossible that they should be slain by any one person, she ascribes their destruction not to Ulysses, but a Deity. But then is not such a supposition extravagant? and can it be reconciled to probability, that a God should really be supposed to descend to work their destruction? It may be answer'd, that the excess of the assertion ought to be ascrib'd to the excess of joy in the speaker: Penelope is in a transport, and no wonder if she speaks with amplification: she judges it impossible that such a great event should be wrought by a mortal hand; and it is therefore very natural, while she is under a surprize, and her thoughts rais'd above the bounds of calm Reason, to ascribe it to a Deity. It has been believ'd that all the notions of good and bad Dæmons that prevail'd among the Antients were borrow'd from truth, and that they receiv'd them by tradition from the offices of good and bad Angels: If I might be allow'd to make this supposition, then what Penelope here speaks may be reconcil'd to strict verity; then we may find a reason why she may without extravagance ascribe the Suitors deaths to a Dæmon, or Deity. Thus, 2 Kings, cap. xix. v. 35. That night the Angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand. If this supposition be thought disallowable, the former will be a sufficient vindication. I will only add that the Poet artfully turns the incredulity of Penelope to the praise of Ulysses; the exploit was so great, that no mortal was brave enough to perform it; it must therefore be wrought by a God; but this God is at length discover'd to be Ulysses. While yet he spoke, the Queen in transport sprung Swift from the couch, and round the matron hung; Fast from her eye descends the rolling tear, Say, once more say, is my Ulysses here? How could that numerous and outragious band By one be slain, tho' by an Heroe's hand? I saw it not, she cries, but heard alone, When death was busy, a loud dying groan, The damsel train turn'd pale at every wound, Immur'd we sate, and catch'd each passing sound; When death had seiz'd her prey, thy son attends, And at his nod the damsel train descends; There terrible in arms Ulysses stood, And the dead Suitors almost swam in blood; Thy heart had leap'd the Heroe to survey, Stern as the surly lion o'er his prey, Glorious in gore!—now with sulphureous fires, The dome he purges, now the flame aspires; Heap'd lie the dead without the Palace walls,— Haste, daughter haste, thy own Ulysses calls! Thy every wish the bounteous Gods bestow, Enjoy the present good, and former woe; Ulysses lives his vanquish'd foes to see; He lives to thy Telemachus and thee! Ah no! with sighs Penelope rejoyn'd, Excess of joy disturbs thy wand'ring mind; How blest this happy hour, should he appear, Dear to us all, to me supremely dear! Ah no! some God the Suitors deaths decreed, Some God descends, and by his hand they bleed; Blind! to contemn the stranger's righteous cause, And violate all hospitable laws! The good they hated, and the Pow'rs defy'd; But heav'n is just, and by a God they dy'd. For never must Ulysses view this shore; Never! the lov'd Ulysses is no more! What words (the matron cries) have reach'd my ears? Doubt we his presence, when he now appears? Then hear conviction: Ere the fatal day That forc'd Ulysses o'er the watry way, A Boar fierce-rushing in the sylvan war Plough'd half his thigh; I saw, I saw the scar, And wild with transport had reveal'd the wound; But ere I spoke, he rose, and check'd the sound. Then daughter haste away! and if a lie Flow from this tongue, then let thy servant die! To whom with dubious joy the Queen replies, Wise is thy soul, but errors seize the wise; The works of Gods what mortal can survey, This assertion is made with great judgment. Euryclea had given almost a demonstrative proof that she was not mistaken in the person of Ulysses: she had instanced in the scar which he received by a boar on mount Parnassus; and this seem'd to be an undeniable evidence of her veracity: what method then could the Poet take to carry on Penelope's incredulity, and give her room to resist such evidence with any appearance of reason? This is very well explain'd by Eustathius. Penelope (observes that Author) answers with profound wisdom; her words are short, but contain excellent truth and morality: This is her meaning: “Euryclea, you appeal to your senses for the truth of your affirmation: you saw the wound, and touch'd it as you bath'd him; and he forbad you to make a discovery of his person: from hence you conclude, that it is Ulysses who has slain the Suitors; not remembring that the Gods are able thus to shew themselves to man, and assume at their pleasure such disguises: How then do you know but this is a God? Are you able to know the ways of a Deity?” To this Euryclea makes no reply; from whence we may gather, that it was believ'd to be an undeniable truth, that the divine Beings sometimes assum'd the shape of man, and appear'd visibly upon earth. Such expressions as these might almost persuade us of the reality of a former conjecture, that these notions were borrow'd from a tradition of the appearances of Angels; they being so consonant to the testimony of the holy Scriptures, and so agreeable to the manifestations of those cœlestial Beings. Who knows their motives, who shall trace their way! But learn we instant how the Suitors trod The paths of death, by Man or by a God. Thus speaks the Queen, and no reply attends, But with alternate joy and fear descends; At ev'ry step debates, her Lord to prove! Penelope apprehends that the person mentioned by Euryclea is not Ulysses; yet her apprehensions are not so strong as to exclude all hopes that he is her husband; in this state of uncertainty she descends, doubtful whether to meet him as such, or first to prove him whether he be the real Ulysses; and this explains her conduct in this place: If he evidently were Ulysses, she ought to receive him with transport; but if he be not Ulysses, then all such advances would be acts of immodesty, and a reproach to her prudence. Ladies are best judges of what is decent amongst Ladies, and Madam Dacier affirms, that the point of decency is well maintain'd by Homer thro' this whole interview; and that Antiquity can shew nothing wherein a severity of manners is better observed. And indeed it must be allow'd, that in this respect Penelope proceeds with no more than a necessary caution; it would have been very absurd to have describ'd her flying to the embraces of a stranger, merely upon the testimony of Euryclea, without waiting for a personal and ocular demonstration. Or rushing to his arms, confess her love! Then gliding thro' the marble valves in state, Oppos'd, before the shining Fire she sate. The Monarch, by a column high enthron'd, The circumstance of persons of figure being plac'd by a column occurs frequently in the Odyssey, it may therefore be necessary to explain it: it is mentioned twice in the eighth book, ???? ????? ?????? ???????, but being there apply'd to Demodocus who was blind, it may be thought to mean only that he lean'd against the pillar by reason of his blindness: but this is not the full import of the words, they denote dignity; and a seat erected near the column was a seat of distinction. Thus 2 Kings xi. 14. Behold the King stood by a pillar, ??? ??? ??????, as the manner was, and the Princes, &amp;c. by the King. Thus we see the Royal station was by some remarkable Pillar; Josephus expresses it by ??? ??? ??????, which probably is a corruption; it ought to be ??? ??? ??????, juxta columnam: Thus again, 2 Kings xxiii. 3. And the King stood by a pillar, and made a covenant, &amp;c. So that by this expression of Ulysses being seated by a column, we are to understand that he received Penelope as a King; he took the royal seat, to convince her that he was the real Ulysses. His eye withdrew, and fix'd it on the ground; We have all along been vindicating the conduct of Penelope, for not immediately acknowledging Ulysses. Her ignorance of his person is her vindication; but how then is Ulysses to be justified, who is in no doubt about Penelope? Why does he not fly with transport to the wife of his affection? The reason is very evident: he very well knows that Penelope is uncertain about his person; he therefore forbears to offer violence to her modesty by any caresses, while she is in this state of uncertainty, and which decency requires her to refuse, till she is assur'd that the person who offers them is Ulysses. Homer tells us, that Ulysses turn'd his eyes toward the ground. Eustathius imagines, that he does it that Penelope may not immediately discover him; but perhaps the Poet intended no more than to draw Ulysses here, as he drew him in the Iliad, Lib. 3. and describe him according to his usual behaviour. ? In thought profound, His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground. Thus also he is represented by Ovid, Metam. lib. 13. Astitit atque oculos paulum tellure moratos, Sustulit ? Then from his seat arose Laertes' son, Look'd down a while, and paus'd ere he begun. Dryden. Curious to hear his Queen the silence break: Amaz'd she sate, and impotent to speak; The Reader will certainly be curious to know how Penelope accosts Ulysses in this first interview, and the Poet manages it with excellent judgment: She must be suppos'd to be under a great surprize and confusion of thought, this surprize takes away her speech; she is tost between hopes and fears, and consequently it is very natural, before she speaks, to examine him with her eyes. O'er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain, Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again. At length Telemachus—Oh who can find O woman like Penelope unkind? Why thus in silence? why with winning charms Thus slow, to fly with rapture to his arms? Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows, When twice ten years are past of mighty woes: To softness lost, to sponsal love unknown, The Gods have form'd that rigid heart of stone! It has been objected that Telemachus here makes too free a remonstrance to Penelope; and that he is wanting in reverence towards his mother. Eustathius answers, that he speaks no more than Ulysses says himself, in the process of the story, and consequently he is no more blameable. But the case is not the same, there is a difference between a son and a husband, and what is decent in the mouth of the latter would be irreverent in the former. Spondanus is of opinion, that he offends against decency, juveniliter nimis insultavit; and Ulysses seems to repress his ardor. Indulge, my son, the cautions of the wise ? No more ? Dacier answers, that Telemachus being fully assur'd that it is the real Ulysses, seems shock'd at the indifference of Penelope. And indeed the warmth of the expression is to be imputed to the emotion of the speaker; so that we are not to look upon it as an outrage of decency toward Penelope, but a warm expostulation occasion'd by his zeal for Ulysses. O my Telemachus! the Queen rejoin'd, Distracting fears confound my lab'ring mind; Pow'rless to speak, I scarce uplift my eyes, Nor dare to question: doubts on doubts arise. O deign he, if Ulysses, to remove These boding thoughts, and what he is, to prove! Pleas'd with her virtuous fears, the King replies, Indulge, my son, the cautions of the wise; Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring: This garb of Poverty belies the King; This expression furnishes another cause for the incredulity of Penelope; Ulysses imputes it to his disguise, and is far from resenting it as a want of conjugal affection. I must confess, that here may seem to be an unseasonable transition: Homer brings Ulysses and Penelope together, raises our expectations to see a warm and tender description at the discovery of the husband to the wife, and all of a sudden he starts from the subject, and leaves us under an uncertainty equal to that of Penelope. The scene closes too abruptly, and Homer acts like one who invites his guests to an entertainment, and when they were sate down with an eager appetite, takes away their dinner. But then it may be answer'd, that the occasion presses: Ulysses finds it necessary to provide for his own safety, before the people of Ithaca are inform'd of the slaughter of the Suitors; this is the dictate of good sense; he first acts the wise man, by guarding against an imminent danger; and then shews the tender husband, by his affection to Penelope: and this is the reason why he adjourns the discovery. Besides, this interval, which is very short, gives time to Penelope to recollect her spirits from surprize, and makes her mistress of her own thoughts. In that view the Reader is to look upon this break, like a pause between the acts in a Tragedy, and as an artful interruption to introduce the unravelling more naturally, and with greater probability. No more.—This day our deepest care requires, Cautious to act what thought mature inspires. If one man's blood, tho' mean, distain our hands, Ulysses here argues very conclusively: If the person who has shed one man's blood only, and that man of inferior station; if he is yet obliged to fly into banishment, lest he should be slain by any of the dead person's relations or friends; what have they to fear, who have not only slain one man, but above an hundred, and these not Plebians, but Princes? They must necessarily have many avengers, who will be ready to pursue our lives. But it may be objected, that Ulysses is a King, and therefore above apprehensions of punishment. 'Tis true, Ulysses is a King, yet subject to the laws: his government was not so despotic, as to have no reason to fear the resentments of the chief families of his subjects, whose heirs were slain by his hand. I cannot entirely agree with Dacier in this last sentiment: Ulysses had only done an act of justice upon these offenders, and had transgress'd no law by it, and ought therefore to apprehend no vengeance from the law. I should rather ascribe the apprehensions of Ulysses, to a fear of a sudden assault from the friends of the Suitors before he could discover himself to be the real Ulysses. He is afraid of an assassination, not a legal punishment; the rage of the people, not the justice of the law. The homicide retreats to foreign lands; By us, in heaps th' illustrious peerage falls, Ulysses, to prove Telemachus, and to form a judgment of his wisdom, asks his advice upon the present emergence; but the Poet in his answer observes a due decency: Telemachus pays a laudable deference to the superior wisdom of Ulysses, and modestly submits to his judgment. What we are to gather from this conduct is, that no person should be so self-confiding in his own judgment, as to despise that of other men, though those men are inferior in wisdom. Th' important deed our whole attention calls. Be that thy care, Telemachus replies, The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise; For Wisdom all is thine! lo I obey, And dauntless follow where you lead the way; Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find Thy coward son degen'rate lag behind. Then instant to the bath, (the Monarch cries) Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise, Thence all descend in pomp and proud array, And bid the dome resound the mirthful lay; While the sweet Lyrist airs of rapture sings, And forms the dance responsive to the strings. That hence th'eluded passengers may say, This is an instance of the art of Ulysses, essential to his character, and maintain'd thro' the whole Odyssey. Eustathius excellently explains the reason of this conduct: The Suitors had been accustomed to retire from the Palace, and sleep in other places by night: it would therefore have alarm'd the whole city, and made them apprehensive that some calamity had befallen them, if there had not appear'd a seeming reason why they returned not to their several houses as usual; Ulysses therefore invents this stratagem to deceive them into an opinion that they stayed to celebrate the Queen's nuptials. But there appears to be a strong objection against this part of the relation: we have already seen the Suitors slain, without being heard by the Ithacans of the city; is it then probable that the sound of the music should be heard abroad, when the cries, shouts and groans, during the fight, were not heard out of the Palace? Was the music louder than these united noises? It is not easy to solve this difficulty, unless we are allowed to imagine that the more than usual stay of the Suitors in the Palace had rais'd the curiosity of some of the Ithacans to enquire the reason of it; who consequently approaching the Palace might hear the musick and dancing, and conclude that it was occasion'd by the Queen's marriage. Besides, in the stillness of the night, a lower sound may be further heard, than one more loud, during the noise and hurry of the day: it being evident from the preceding book, that the fight was by day. Lo! the Queen weds! we hear the spousal lay! The Suitors death unknown, 'till we remove It may be ask'd, what occasions this recess of Ulysses? Will he be better able to resist his enemies in the country than in the city? The answer is, he withdraws that he may avoid the first resentments of the Ithacans, upon the discovery of the death of the Suitors: Besides, it is by this method in his power to conceal his person, till the violence of the people is settled; or raise a party to resist their efforts: at the worst, he is certain to secure his flight, if his affairs should be reduc'd to extremities. Far from the court, and act inspir'd by Jove. Thus spoke the King: Th' observant train obey, At once they bathe, and dress in proud array; The Lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance, And fair-zon'd damsels form the sprightly dance. The voice, attun'd to instrumental sounds, Ascends the roof; the vaulted roof rebounds; Not unobserv'd: the Greeks eluded say Lo! the Queen weds! we hear the spousal lay! Inconstant! to admit the bridal hour. Thus they—but nobly chaste she weds no more. Mean-while the weary'd King the bath ascends; With faithful cares Eurynomè attends, O'er ev'ry limb a show'r of fragrance sheds: Then drest in pomp, magnificent he treads. The Warrior-Goddess gives his frame to shine With majesty enlarg'd, and grace divine. Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly His thick large locks, of Hyacinthine dye. As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives His heav'nly skill, a breathing image lives; By Pallas taught, he frames the wond'rous mold, And the pale silver glows with fusile gold: So Pallas his heroic form improves With bloom divine, and like a God he moves; More high he treads, and issuing forth in state, Radiant before his gazing Consort sate. And oh my Queen! he cries; what pow'r above Has steel'd that heart, averse to spousal love! Canst thou, Penelope, when heav'n restores Thy lost Ulysses to his native shores, Canst thou, oh cruel! unconcern'd survey Thy lost Ulysses, on this signal day? Haste, Euryclea, and dispatchful spread These words have given occasion of censure from Monsieur de la Mothe de Vayér: According to whom the precaution of Penelope is not much to be admir'd; “Ulysses made himself suspicious by expressing so much eagerness to go to bed with Penelope; she was so far from having time enough to know him, that she had scarce spoke three words to him, but he bluntly commands Euryclea to get the bed ready for them,” So that, according to this Author, Penelope mistrusts his impatience; she imagines the reason why he is so hasty, is because, he fears that a longer time would discover his imposture, and frustrate his desires. And indeed if Ulysses had given such a command, the objection had not been without a foundation. But La Mothe is deceiv'd: Ulysses does not ask a bed for himself and Penelope, but for himself alone, because his wife vouchsafed not to come near him, and used him with a seeming cruelty. ???? ??? ??? ???? ???????? ????? ???? ??? ????? ??????? ? which is literally enough render'd in the translation. Haste Euryclea, and dispatchful spread For me, and me alone, th'imperial bed. For me, and me alone, th' imperial bed: My weary nature craves the balm of rest: But heav'n with Adamant has arm'd her breast. Ah no! she cries, a tender heart I bear, It is not easy to translate this passage literally. ? ???? ???? ???????????, ???? ???????, ???? ???? ??????. Eustathius explains ??????????? to signifie, I am not of a proud heart; ???????, I despise not your poverty; ??????, I am no longer under an astonishment; or, ???? ???? ??????????, I cease to be surpriz'd at what I see and hear. Thus Penelope speaks negatively, and the meaning of her words are, that she is not influenc'd by pride and cruelty, to persist in her incredulity, but by a laudable care and caution. Eustathius proposes Penelope as a pattern to all women upon the like occasion: her own eyes persuade her that the person with whom she confers is Ulysses; Euryclea acknowledges her master; Telemachus his father; yet she dares not immediately credit her own eye, Euryclea or Telemachus: and the same Author concludes with a pretty observation, that Ulysses found it easier to subdue above an hundred enemies than the diffidence and incredulity of Penelope. A foe to pride; no adamant is there; And now, ev'n now it melts! for sure I see Once more Ulysses my belov'd in thee! Fix'd in my soul as when he sail'd to Troy, His image dwells: then haste the bed of joy! Haste, from the bridal bow'r the bed translate, Fram'd by his hand, and be it drest in state! Thus speaks the Queen, still dubious, with disguise; It must be allowed that this is a very artful turn of thought in Penelope. Ulysses commands a bed to be prepared, Penelope catches the word, and seeming to consent, orders Euryclea to carry the bed out of the bridal apartment, and prepare it. Now this bed was of such a nature as to be inwrought into the substance of the apartment it self, and could not be removed: if therefore Ulysses had acquiesc'd in the injunction given by Penelope, and not discovered the impossibility of it, she might very justly have concluded him an impostor, being manifestly ignorant of the secret of his own marriage-bed. But Eustathius starts an objection against this whole process of the discovery, which he calls insolvible; and indeed if Homer fails in the unravelling of his Poem, he is to be severely blam'd: Tully is of his opinion, Illic enim debet toto animo a poetâ in dissolutionem nodi agi; eaque præcipua fabulæ pars est, quæ requirit diligentiam. The difficulty rais'd by Eustathius is as follows: Penelope imagines that the person who pretends to be her husband, is not really Ulysses, but a God, who not only assumes his form, but, to favour the imposture, the resemblance of the wound receiv'd from the boar: Now if he be a God, how is it possible she should conceive him to be ignorant of the secret of the marriage-bed, and consequently how can she be convinc'd of the reality of Ulysses from his knowledge of it, when it must necessarily be known to a God, as well as to the real Ulysses? all that she ought to gather from it is, that the person with whom she speaks is Ulysses, or a God. Eustathius replies, that Penelope upon the discovery of the secret makes no scruple to yield; because whether it be Ulysses, or a God, her case is happy: if he prove to be Ulysses, she has her wishes; if a God, it is no small piece of good fortune. Dacier condemns this solution, and tells us, that Penelope was so faithful to her husband, that she would not have received even a God into the place of Ulysses: The true answer (continues that Author) is to be drawn from the Pagan Theology, according to which the inferior Deities were suppos'd to have a finite knowledge, and consequently Penelope might think the discovery of the nature of the nuptial-bed a full conviction of the reality of Ulysses, it being so great a secret that even a God might be ignorant of it. But this is all fancy; for allowing this person to be a God, why might not Penelope imagine him to be a Deity of the superior order, and for that reason well acquainted with the secrets of this nuptial bow'r? especially because Jupiter himself was notorious for such amorous illusions. Dacier her self confesses this to be no just solution, but gives a very different reason: How is it possible (says she) that this bed and whole apartment should be built by the single hand of Ulysses, without being seen by any person while he builds it? or how can any one be assured that a secret that is known to a third person (Actoris) is not thro' weakness or interest discovered to others? 'Tis true the manner of the discovery entirely depends upon the choice of the Poet, but I could wish that he had chosen a method more probable than this of the nuptial bed, which in my judgment (continues the same Author) is unworthy of the Odyssey. I am persuaded that this is one of the places where (as Horace writes) Homer nods. I will lay together what occurs to me by way of reply. The first objection is, that Penelope imagines Ulysses to be a God, and consequently his knowledge of the nuptial bed ought not to have induc'd her to believe him to be the real Ulysses: The answer is, Penelope thought him a God only during her first transport; it is to be imputed to her surprize, that she at all thinks him a Deity: This is very evident, for from the moment she saw him, the thought of his divinity vanishes, and she never mentions one word concerning such a supposition, nay from the first glance she almost believes him to be the real Ulysses. O'er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain, Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again. She is so far from thinking him a Deity, that she is almost persuaded that he is her husband. If this be allow'd, the first difficulty ceases: For granting her belief that the person before her is a real man, and no man but Ulysses was acquainted with the nuptial bed; it follows, that this man is the real Ulysses, and that this incident is not ill chosen by the Poet, in the discovery of Ulysses. Dacier objects, that this apartment could not possibly be erected without being known to other persons; but we have seen Ulysses build a ship in a solitary Island, without the assistance of any man, in the fifth Odyssey; and why may he not then be allowed to do the same, with respect to this nuptial bower? All kind of arts in Mechanics were antiently practis'd by the greatest personages, and their knowledge and dexterity in them was esteem'd a glory. This consideration may perhaps reconcile the Reader to this part of the discovery. The only difficulty that now remains is this: Actoris, a female servant, is allow'd to be in the secret; how then can Penelope be assur'd that she has not betray'd it? Homer himself obviates this objection; he has in a very solemn manner told us, that only twelve of all the female train were guilty of a breach of trust, and therefore Penelope may safely rely upon the fidelity of Actoris. Besides, it adds no small weight to this vindication of Homer, to observe, that the whole procedure of the discovery is accidental; how could Ulysses fore-know that the proof of his veracity would depend upon his knowledge of the bridal bower? and consequently it is not to be imagin'd that he should have made any clandestine enquiries about it: It may be added, that Ulysses has been no more than five days upon the Ithacan shores, and probably had never seen Actoris, who alone was acquainted with the nature of this bed: no person was antiently permitted to enter the women's apartment, but fathers, husbands, or brothers; this therefore was the greatest secret in all families; this secret Penelope proposes in the tryal of Ulysses, and upon his knowledge of it receives him as her husband. To instance almost in a parallel case; Orestes in Euripides tells Iphigenia, that the lance which Pelops us'd in the combat against Ænomaus was lodg'd in her apartment; this circumstance convinces her that the person who knew this secret must be her brother Orestes, no persons of a more distant relation being admitted into such privacies. Touch'd at her words, the King with warmth replies, Alas for this! what mortal strength can move Th'enormous burthen, who but heav'n above? It mocks the weak attempts of human hands; But the whole earth must move, if heav'n commands. Then hear sure evidence, while we display Words seal'd with sacred truth, and truth obey: This hand the wonder fram'd; An olive spread Full in the court its ever-verdant head. Vast as some mighty column's bulk on high I will not promise that the Reader will be pleas'd with this description of the nuptial bower: the Greek is noble, and the words sounding and harmonious; an happiness that is wanting in our language. In this and the like cases the translator must say with Lucretius upon a like occasion, ? Graiorum obscura reperta Difficile illustrare Latinis versibus esse, Propter Egestatem linguæ, &amp; rerum novitatem. Besides, it must be allow'd that the relation it self is very wonderful; for it is not easy to conceive that the bole of an olive-tree should be so large as to contain upon the dimensions of it a whole bedsted. I would willingly imagine that it is only a supporter of it. It is likewise somewhat extraordinary that this olive-tree is not fell'd, or cut up from the roots; for Eustathius informs us, that ???????? signifies to cut asunder at some distance from the earth; so that a great part of the trunc is left standing, upon which Ulysses builds his bridal bed. What occurs to me upon this incident is, that Homer must be imagined to write according to the customs of the age in which he lived, unless we can suppose he unnecessarily invented an absurdity: I therefore doubt not but there were anciently such beds as this of Ulysses. Besides, the more wonderful this bed is, the better it serves for the purpose of Homer, in convincing us that the person who was acquainted with a matter so uncommon must be the real Ulysses, and not an impostor; it is for this purpose that the Poet describes the bower built round the olive-tree, before the framing of the bed is at all mention'd. Around the tree I rais'd a nuptial bow'r, And roof'd defensive of the storm and show'r; Then lopp'd the branchy head; aloft in twain Sever'd the bole, and smooth'd the shining grain. This I say is particularly describ'd by Homer, to convince us that the place where the bed stood was entirely secret; it being clos'd up from observation before this particular apartment was undertaken, and therefore the knowledge of it was a strong argument that the person who was acquainted with it must be the real Ulysses. The huge trunc rose, and heav'd into the sky; Around the tree I rais'd a nuptial bow'r And roof'd defensive of the storm and show'r; The spacious valve, with art inwrought, conjoins; And the fair dome with polish'd marble shines. I lopp'd the branchy head; aloft in twain Sever'd the bole, and smooth'd the shining grain; Then posts, capacious of the frame, I raise, And bore it, regular from space to space: Athwart the frame, at equal distance lye Thongs of tough hides, that boast a purple dye; Then polishing the whole, the finish'd mold With silver shone, with elephant, and gold. But if o'erturn'd by rude, ungovern'd hands, Or still inviolate the olive stands, 'Tis thine, oh Queen, to say: And now impart, If fears remain, or doubts distract thy heart? While yet he speaks, her pow'rs of life decay, She sickens, trembles, falls, and faints away: At length recov'ring, to his arms she flew, And strain'd him close, as to his breast she grew; The tears pour'd down amain: And oh, she cries, Let not against thy spouse thine anger rise! O vers'd in every turn of human art, Forgive the weakness of a woman's heart! The righteous pow'rs that mortal lots dispose, Decree us to sustain a length of woes, And from the flow'r of life, the bliss deny To bloom together, fade away, and dye. O let me, let me not thine anger move, That I forbore, thus, thus, to speak my love; Thus in fond kisses, while the transport warms, Pour out my soul, and die within thy arms! I dreaded fraud! Men, faithless men, betray Our easy faith, and make the sex their prey: Against the fondness of my heart I strove, 'Twas caution, oh my Lord! not want of love: Like me had Helen fear'd, with wanton charms This passage occasion'd great disputes amongst the antient Critics; some contended for the common punctuation; others thus read it, ?? ???, ? Then the meaning of the passage is thus to be understood. Helen would not have yielded to a stranger, if she had known that stranger. ?? ??? ????? is to be understood according to this interpretation. The same Critics thus construe the following words, ? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ??????, &amp;c. O is the same with ?? ?, propter hanc causam, and the whole passage is thus to be translated, If Helen had known the stranger, she would not have yielded to him; therefore the Greeks rose in arms to free her from the impostor. They defend this application by having recourse to a tradition, that Paris could never have obtain'd the consent of Helen if Venus had not given him the resemblance of Menelaus, in whose form he prevail'd upon that fatal beauty: otherwise the instance is no way parallel; for if Helen was not deceived, how can her example be brought to induce Penelope to act with caution, lest she take an impostor to her bed instead of an husband? I confess this construction of the Greek appears to me very obscure; contrary to the style of Homer, which is always clear and natural. Besides, it contradicts the whole story of Helen thro' the Iliad and Odyssey, and she her self no where alledges this deceit as her excuse, but frequently condemns her own conduct in forsaking the bed of Menelaus. But granting that she was thus deceiv'd originally, the deceit must necessarily soon appear, and yet she voluntarily cohabits many years with Paris. The other interpretation may therefore perhaps be preferable; namely, if Helen had consider'd what evils might ensue from her injury to Menelaus, she would have acted more wisely: This Penelope introduces to vindicate her conduct in acting with so much caution; she opposes her wariness to the inconsiderateness of Helen, and ascribes all the calamities of Greece to it. Ere the fair Mischief set two worlds in arms, Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day, Thus had she fear'd, she had not gone astray. But heav'n, averse to Greece, in wrath decreed That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed: Blind to the ills that from injustice flow, She colour'd all our wretched lives with woe. But why these sorrows, when my Lord arrives? I yield, I yield! my own Ulysses lives! The secrets of the bridal bed are known To thee, to me, to Actoris alone, (My father's present in the spousal hour, The sole attendant on our genial bow'r.) Since what no eye has seen thy tongue reveal'd, Hard and distrustful as I am, I yield. Touch'd to the soul the King with rapture hears, Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears. As to the shipwreck'd mariner, the shores, Delightful rise, when angry Neptune roars, Then, when the surge in thunder mounts the sky, And gulph'd in crouds at once the sailors die, If one more happy, while the tempest raves Out-lives the tumult of conflicting waves, All pale, with ooze deform'd, he views the strand, And plunging forth with transport grasps the land. The ravish'd Queen with equal rapture glows, Clasps her lov'd Lord, and to his bosom grows. Nor had they ended till the morning ray: But Pallas backward held the rising day, We are not to look upon this merely as a poetical ornament, there is no necessity for it. The battle between the Suitors and Ulysses happen'd in the evening; since then we have seen the Palace purify'd, the dead Suitors carried away, and the female servants punish'd; Euryclea has held a long conference with Penelope, there has been singing and dancing in the Palace, and an interview at large described between Ulysses and Penelope; then the Poet proceeds to re-capitulate the story of the whole Odyssey: Now all these incidents could not be comprehended in the compass of one night: Homer therefore, to reconcile it to probability, introduces Minerva to protract it, and make the time proportionable to the incidents. But perhaps it may be thought a violent machine, and contrary to the established laws of Nature, to suppose the course of the night alterable: the answer is, Poets are allowed to write according to common fame, and what Homer here relates could not shock the ears of the Antients, who had before heard of the like story at the conception of Hercules. I will only observe, that Homer gives no more than two horses to Aurora's Chariot, Lampus and Phaethon; whereas the Chariot of the sun is described with four: Thus Ovid, Interea volucres Pyroeis, Eous, &amp; Æthon, Solis equi, quartusque Phlegon. The wheels of night retarding, to detain The gay Aurora in the wavy main: Whose flaming steeds, emerging thro' the night, Beam o'er the eastern hills with streaming light. At length Ulysses with a sigh replies: Yet Fate, yet cruel Fate repose denies; A labour long, and hard, remains behind; By heav'n above, by hell beneath enjoin'd: For, to Tiresias thro' th' eternal gates Of hell I trod, to learn my future fates. But end we here—the night demands repose, Be deck'd the couch! and peace a-while my woes! To whom the Queen. Thy word we shall obey, And deck the couch; far hence be woes away! Since the just Gods who tread the starry plains Restore thee safe, since my Ulysses reigns. But what those perils heav'n decrees, impart; Knowledge may grieve, but fear distracts the heart. Ulysses had said in the sentence immediately preceding, A labour long, and hard, remains. This could not fail of alarming Penelope, and raising all her curiosity to know it. Homer would greatly have offended against nature, if he had not described her under an impatience upon the mention of it: her fondness is too sincere to be indifferent upon such a suggestion, but her answer to Ulysses chiefly demands observation. If heav'n a kind release from ills foreshows, Triumph, thou happy victor of thy woes! This discovers a greatness of spirit worthy of a Queen and Heroine: she is threatned to lose Ulysses by a second absence, she is alarm'd with a new train of his sufferings; but being inform'd that all these calamities will end in a prosperous issue, that long life and happiness attend him, she not only takes courage personally, but comforts her husband. Homer was too good a judge of decency to ascribe the weakness that attends the generality of that sex to Penelope; she has a bravery of soul worthy of a Heroine in Epic Poetry. Besides, this is a further instance of Homer's judgment: the event of the Odyssey is to shew Ulysses happy; now if the Poet had not fully satisfy'd the Reader in this respect, he had not reinstated his Heroe in prosperity, and consequently had defeated the Moral of the Odyssey, which is to shew wisdom and virtue triumphant, by representing his Heroe after all difficulties settled in full tranquillity. To this the King. Ah why must I disclose A dreadful story of approaching woes? Why in this hour of transport wound thy ears, When thou must learn what I must speak with tears? Heav'n, by the Theban ghost, thy spouse decrees Torn from thy arms, to sail a length of seas; From realm to realm a Nation to explore Who ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar, Nor saw gay vessel stem the surgy plain, A painted wonder, flying on the main, An Oar my hand must bear; a shepherd eyes The unknown instrument with strange surprize, And calls a Corn-van: This upon the plain I fix, and hail the Monarch of the main; Then bathe his altars with the mingled gore Of victims vow'd, a ram, a bull, a boar: Thence swift re-sailing to my native shores, Due victims slay to all th'æthereal pow'rs. Then heav'n decrees in peace to end my days, And steal my self from life by slow decays; Unknown to pain in age resign my breath, When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death; To the dark grave retiring as to rest; My people blessing, by my people blest. Such future scenes th'all-righteous pow'rs display, By their dread Tiresias. Seer, and such my future day. To whom thus firm of soul: If ripe for death, And full of days, thou gently yield thy breath: While heav'n a kind release from ills foreshows, Triumph, thou happy victor of thy woes! But Euryclea with dispatchful care, And sage Eurynomè, the couch prepare: Instant they bid the blazing torch display Around the dome an artificial day; Then to repose her steps the Matron bends, And to the Queen Eurynomè descends; A torch she bears to light with guiding fires The royal pair; she guides them, and retires. Then instant his fair spouse Ulysses led The Reader may be pleas'd to consult the Annotations on book XI. p. 136. concerning the answer of Ulysses to Penelope; it being a repetition from that part of the Odyssey. Eustathius informs us, that Aristarchus, and Aristophanes the Grammarian, thought the verse quoted at the head of this remark to be the conclusion of the Odyssey, and consequently they judged the remaining part of this book and the whole 24th supposititious: those who were of a contrary opinion reply'd, that by ending the Poem with that verse, many incidents of great importance would be rejected; for instance, the recapitulation of the whole Odyssey, and especially the discovery of Ulysses to his father Laertes, with all the beautiful fictions contain'd in it. They add, that if the little relation that the beginning of that book bears to the subject of the Poem be a reason for the rejection of it, we must for the same reason abridge the Poem, and reject a multitude of the Fables which are scatter'd thro' the whole course of it. It may therefore be conjectured that Aristarchus and Aristophanes were not of opinion that the Poem ended with this verse, but only the most necessary and important incidents. Casaubon in a remark upon a passage of Strabo, favours the opinion of Aristarchus, for he there speaks of the last book as if he suspected it to be spurious; and Rapin joins in the same judgment. Homer is to be defended in another manner, than by such arguments as are brought in answer to Aristarchus. The same Objection has been made against the two last books of the Iliad, as against these of the Odyssey; the former ought to have ended with the decisive action in the death of Hector, and the latter with the discovery of Ulysses to Penelope, when his happiness seems to be establish'd. But there is no weight in these objections. There is a difference between the unravelling of the action and the full accomplishment of it; the Action is unravell'd by the death of the Suitors; but there are consequences arising from their deaths that hinder the accomplishment of the action, namely, the danger of the resentments of their friends, who rise in arms to revenge their slaughter; and till their insurrection is pacify'd, Ulysses cannot be said to be in a state of security. The subject of the Iliad is the Anger of Achilles: that of the Odyssey, the Re-establishment of Ulysses in his dominions: now the anger of Achilles ends not with the death of Hector, nor is Ulysses fully re-established by the death of the Suitors; he has another obstacle to overcome, and till the commotions of the Ithacans are appeas'd, the design of the Poem is not executed, which is to shew Ulysses in peaceful possession of his Palace and Authority. We see in this very book, that Ulysses is forc'd to fly from his own Palace; can he then be said to be re-established in tranquillity; this very action demonstrates, that what follows is part of the subject of the Poem, and such a part, as if it had not been related, would have given us room to have imagin'd that Homer had never finish'd it, or that the conclusion of it had been lost. The beginning of the Action is his sailing from Troy toward his country; the middle contains all the calamities he sustains in his return, the disorders of his family before and after it; and the end of the Action is his re-establishment in the peaceful possession of his kingdoms, when he is acknowledg'd by his wife, father, family, and subjects: now this is not compleated till the very end of the last book, and consequently that book is not spurious, but essential. The Poet had ended very injudiciously, if he had stopped before; for the Reader would have remain'd unsatisfy'd in two necessary points, viz. how he was made known to Laertes, and what vengeance the chief families of the nation endeavour'd to take against the destroyers of their sons; but this storm being once blown over, and all his subjects who had taken arms being either vanquished or appeas'd, the Action is compleated in all its parts, and consummates the Odyssey. To the chaste love-rites of the nuptial bed. And now the blooming youths and sprightly fair Cease the gay dance, and to their rest repair; But in discourse the King and Consort lay, While the soft hours stole unperceiv'd away; Intent he hears Penelope disclose A mournful story of domestic woes, It is with great judgment that the Poet passes thus briefly over the story of Penelope; he makes her impatience to hear the history of Ulysses the pretended occasion of her conciseness; the true reason is, he is unwilling to tire his Reader by repeating what he already knows: It is likewise remarkable, that Ulysses does not begin his own adventures by a detail of his sufferings during the war of Troy; for this would have been foreign to the design of the Odyssey; but with his sailing from Troy to the Cicons, and enters directly into the subject of it. He likewise concludes an Epitome of the whole Odyssey in the compass of one and thirty lines; and purposely contracts it, because we are already acquainted with the whole relation. Lycophron has given us a summary of the wandrings of Ulysses; which if any one is desirous to compare with this of Homer, he will see the difference between a clear, and an obscure Writer. Tibullus in his Panegyric on Messala has been more successful than Lycophron, he follows the order of Homer, and treads directly in his footsteps. Nam ciconumque manus adversis repulit armis, Non valuit Lotos captos avertere cursus; Cessit &amp; Etnææ Neptunius incola rupis, Victa Marenæo fœdatus lumina Baccho. Vexit &amp; Æolios placidum per Nerea ventos; Incultos adiit Læstrygonas, &amp;c. Dacier is of opinion, that this recapitulation in Homer has a very good effect. I will translate her observation. We learn from it, that the subject of the Odyssey is not alone the return of Ulysses to his country, and his re-establishment in it; but that it comprehends all his wandrings and all his voyages; all that he saw, or suffer'd in his return to it; in a word, all that he underwent after he set sail from the shores of Troy: Another advantage we reap from it is, that we see the order and train of the adventures of his Heroe, as they really happen'd, naturally and historically: for in his relation of them in his Poem, he uses an artificial order; that is, he begins at the latter end, and finds an opportunity to insert all that precedes the opening of his Poem by way of narration to the Phæacians: Here he sets every event in its natural order, so that with a glance of the eye we may distinguish what gives continuity to the action, and what is comprended in it. By this method we are able to separate the time of the duration of the Poem, from the time of the duration of the Action; for in reality the Poem begins many years before the return of Ulysses; but Homer begins his action but thirty five days before he lands in his own country. In the course therefore of the Odyssey, Homer gave us the artificial, here the natural order; which is an ease and assistance to the memory of the Reader. His servants insults, his invaded bed, How his whole flocks and herds exhausted bled, His generous wines dishonour'd shed in vain, And the wild riots of the Suitor-train. The King alternate a dire tale relates, Of wars, of triumphs, and disastrous fates; All he unfolds: His list'ning spouse turns pale With pleasing horror at the dreadful tale, Sleepless devours each word; and hears, how slain Cicons on Cicons swell th' ensanguin'd plain; How to the land of Lote unblest he sails; And images the rills, and flow'ry vales! How dash'd like dogs, his friends the Cyclops tore, (Not unreveng'd) and quaff'd the spouting gore; How the loud storms in prison bound, he sails From friendly Æölus with prosp'rous gales; Yet fate withstands! a sudden tempest roars And whirls him groaning from his native shores: How on the barb'rous Læstrigonian coast, By savage hands his fleet and friends he lost; How scarce himself surviv'd: He paints the bow'r, The spells of Circe, and her magic pow'r; His dreadful journey to the realms beneath, To seek Tiresias in the vales of death; How in the doleful mansions he survey'd His royal mother, pale Anticlea's shade; And friends in battle slain, heroic ghosts! Then how unharm'd he past the Siren-coasts, The justling rocks where fierce Charybids, raves, And howling Scylla whirls her thund'rous waves, The cave of death! How his companions slay The story of these oxen is fully related, lib. 12. I refer to the Annotations. The crime of the companions of Ulysses was sacrilege, they having destroyed the herds sacred to a God. These herds were said to be immortal: I have there given the reason of it, but too concisely, and will therefore add a supplement from the Polyhymnia of Herodotus, I ought to have mention'd, that the body of soldiers call'd Immortal, was a select number of men in the army of Xerxes: so nam'd, because upon the death of any one of their number, whether by war or sickness, another was immediately substituted into his room, so that that they never amounted to more or less than ten thousand. If we apply this piece of History to the herds of Apollo, it excellently explains Homer's Poetry: they are call'd Immortal, because upon the death of any one of the whole herd, another was brought into its place; they are said neither to increase nor decay, because they were always of a fix'd number, and continually supply'd upon any vacancy. The Reader will be appriz'd of the heinousness of the crime in killing these oxen, from an observation of Bochart, p. 314. The Phœnicians and Ægyptians so superstitiously abstain'd from the flesh of the ox, that, as Porphyry affirms, they would sooner feed upon human flesh than that of such beasts. Ælian tells us, that it was death amongst the Phrygians to kill a labouring ox; and Varro, Rust. lib. 2. cap. 5. thus writes; ab hoc antiqui manus ita abstineri voluerunt, ut capite sanxerint, si quis occidisset. Thus also Columella, in præsat. lib. 7. Cujus tanta fuit apud antiquos veneratio, ut tam Capitale esset bovem necâsse, quam civem. I have been the more full upon this head, to shew that Homer's fiction is built upon a foundation of truth, and that he writes according to the religion of the Antients: Rapin is very severe upon him for ascribing the death of the companions of Ulysses, to the violation of these herds of Apollo. “The reason (says he) why they are destroy'd is very ridiculous, because, lib. 1. ? they dar'd to prey On herds devoted to the God of day. This is certainly a far-fetch'd destruction: The Heroe, or the Poet was willing to be freed from them.” But from this observation, they will be found to be guilty of sacrilege, and a violation of what was regarded by the world with the utmost veneration; and consequently the crime is adequate to the punishment. Besides, Horace Epist. 6. lib. 1. gives sentence against these companions of Ulysses. ? Cærite cerâ Digni, remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulyssei; Cui potior patriâ fuit interdicta voluptas. The oxen sacred to the God of day, 'Till Jove in wrath the ratl'ing Tempest guides, And whelms th'offenders in the roaring tydes: How struggling thro' the surge, he reach'd the shores Of fair Ogygia, and Calypso's bow'rs; Where the gay blooming Nymph constrain'd his stay, This is a circumstance (observes Madam Dacier) that Ulysses ought by no means to forget; for it gives him an opportunity to pay an high compliment to his wife, by letting her know he preferr'd her person to that of Calypso a Goddess: this is the reason why he enlarges upon it in five verses; whereas he concludes most of the other adventures in little more than one. But (adds that Lady) we may easily believe that he was silent about the nature of his conversation with that Nymph; and indeed it would have lessen'd the compliment, and perhaps his welcome home, if he had not been able to keep a secret; he is very cautious in this respect; he enlarges upon the fondness of Calypso for his person, but suppresses, for a very obvious reason, the kind returns he made for her civilities. With sweet reluctant amorous delay; And promis'd, vainly promis'd, to bestow Immortal life exempt from age and woe: How sav'd from storms Phæacia's coast he trod, By great Alcinous honour'd as a God, Who gave him last his country to behold, With change of raiment, brass, and heaps of gold. He ended, sinking into sleep, and shares A sweet forgetfulness of all his cares. Soon as soft slumber eas'd the toils of day, Minerva rushes thro' th'aereal way, And bids Aurora with her golden wheels Flame from the Ocean o'er the eastern hills: Uprose Ulysses from the genial bed, And thus with thought mature the Monarch said. My Queen, my consort! thro' a length of years, We drank the cup of sorrow mix'd with tears, Thou, for thy Lord; while me th' immortal pow'rs Detain'd reluctant from my native shores. Now, blest again by heav'n, the Queen display, And rule our Palace with an equal sway: Be it my care, by loans, or martial toils, To throng my empty'd folds, with gifts or spoils. But now I haste to bless Laertes' eyes With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies; The good old man, to wasting woes a prey, Weeps a sad life in solitude away. But hear, tho' wise! This morning shall unfold The deathful scene, on Heroes, Heroes roll'd; Thou with thy Maids within the Palace stay, From all the scene of tumult far away! He spoke, and sheath'd in arms, incessant flies To wake his son; and bid his friends arise. To arms! aloud he cries: His friends obey, With glitt'ring arms their manly limbs array, And pass the City-gate; Ulysses leads the way. Now flames the rosy dawn, but Pallas shrouds Ulysses, to avoid observation, leaves the City at the point of day, before the darkness was quite dispell'd; this is the suggestion of his own wisdom, which is figured by Minerva. This book ends in the morning of the forty first day. There are but few verses in the translation, more than in Homer: I speak it not as if this were a beauty, it may as well be a fault; our Heroic verse consists but of ten syllables, the Greek oftentimes of seventeen, as in this verse, ????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???? ????????. We therefore write with the disadvantage of seven syllables, which makes it generally impossible to comprehend the sense of one line in Homer within the compass of one line in a translation, with any tolerable beauty; but in some parts, where the subject seem'd to hang heavy, this has been attempted; with what success, must be left to the Reader. The latent warriors in a veil of clouds. THE TWENTY-FOURTH BOOK OF THE ODYSSEY. The ARGUMENT. The souls of the Suitors are conducted by Mercury to the infernal shades. Ulysses in the country goes to the retirement of his father Laertes; he finds him busyed in his garden all alone: The manner of his discovery to him is beautifully described. They return together to his lodge, and the King is acknowledged by Dolius and the servants. The Ithacensians, led by Eupithes the father of Antinous, rise against Ulysses, who gives them battle, in which Eupithes is killed by Laertes: And the Goddess Pallas makes a lasting peace between Ulysses and his subjects, which concludes the Odyssey. It has been already proved, that this book is the genuine work of Homer; but perhaps the Reader may not be displeas'd to see the reasons why it was rejected by so great a Critic as Aristarchus: I shall therefore lay them before him from Didymus and Spondanus. Aristarchus affirms, that this is the only place in Homer, where Mercury performs the office of conducting the souls of the dead; and that there is no proof he was known so early by the title of ??????????; that this is the only passage where he is called Cyllenius; that the ceremony of his guiding the souls is contrary to other descriptions of Homer, where they all descend without a guide into the mansions of the dead, even before the funeral rites. That it is absurd to imagine a white rock in these kingdoms of darkness, &amp;c. To these Didymus thus replies. If a single mention of any incident in Homer were a reason for its objection, abundance of passages must be rejected. He thinks it a sufficient argument, that Mercury was called ??????????, and Cyllenius in the days of Homer, that he is here mentioned under these titles; but this is begging the question. He adds, that altho' the souls of the dead descend without a guide in other places, this hinders not but they may descend with one; for they are in other places only said in general to descend, whereas here the manner of their descent is particularized. Neither is it any objection against this book, to say that it is contrary to the manner of Homer to describe the shades of the dead received immediately into the state of Achilles, Agamemnon, &amp;c. before the performance of their funeral ceremonies; this (says he) is a favour granted by Mercury to Ulysses, who was descended from that Deity, he being the father of Arcisius, and consequently great grandfather to Ulysses. It was the opinion of the antients, that the shades of the deceased could visit the earth before the obsequies were finished, but not afterwards; this is evident from the words of Patroclus, Iliad 23. ? To the further shore, When once we pass, the soul returns no more. It is therefore out of favour to Ulysses, that Mercury introduces these shades into the region where Agamemnon resided, before the funeral ceremonies, that they might not return to earth and disquiet Ulysses. But there may be a stronger objection made against the former part of this book; namely, that this is an Episode which has no relation to the principal subject, and that we may retrench it without destroying any part of the Action essential to the Odyssey: But it may be answered, that tho' it makes no part of the principal Action, yet it has a sufficient connection with it: it is the sequel of the death of the Suitors, and consequently the principal Action is the cause of it; it is drawn and deduc'd from it, and Homer makes a very happy use of it to adorn and diversify his Poem, with the history of what happen'd before Troy, after the conclusion of the Iliad; and in particular, with the death of Achilles, and a description of his funeral ceremonies. Didymus, Dacier. Plato in the beginning of his third Dialogue, de Repub brings an heavy charge against Homer, for the disadvantageous character he gives of a future state. He quotes the similitude of the Bats, and affirms that the dreadful description of the condition of the dead, must deter mankind from hazarding their lives, even in the cause of their country. “Let us then (says that Author) with the permission of Homer and other Poets, reject such relations, not because they are unpoetical, not because they are unpleasant to read, but because by how much they are more pleasant and poetical, by so much they are more dangerous, and to be kept from our youth, and men, who are born to assert their liberty with the hazard of their lives, and prefer death to slavery.” It must be allowed that this is strong reasoning, and 'tis not easy to guard the Doctrine of Homer from such unhappy consequences; for why should men chuse to die, rather than be slaves, when by death they fall into a worse condition? It will not be an answer to say that Homer asserts a threefold state in futurity, viz. of the soul, the ???????, or vehicle, and the body: and that while the vehicle is in this condition of horrors, the soul may be happy; for still the state of the dead is represented as a state of horror, and man is in part (namely, in his ???????) miserable after death: Nay, so miserable, that even Hercules, who was a God and received amongst the Deities, is yet tormented in Hell; lib. XI. Here hov'ring ghosts, like fowl, his shade surround, And clang their pinions with terrific sound, Gloomy as night he stands, in act to throw Th' aerial arrow from the twanging bow. It will indeed be a vindication of Homer as a Poet, to say, that he wrote according to the opinion of his age; and that such as was the notion of the Antients of a future state, such is his description of it. I will only add, that we may collect from Plato, that he judg'd this book genuine, for he quotes this passage as Homer's. Cyllenius now to Pluto's dreary reign Conveys the dead, a lamentable train! The golden wand, that causes sleep to fly, Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye, That drives the ghosts to realms of night or day, Points out the long, uncomfortable way. Trembling the Spectres glide, and plaintive vent Thin, hollow screams, along the deep descent. As in the cavern of some rifted den, Where flock nocturnal bats, and birds obscene; Cluster'd they hang, till at some sudden shock, They move, and murmurs run thro' all the rock: So cow'ring fled the sable heaps of ghosts, And such a scream fill'd all the dismal coasts. And now they reach'd the Earth's remotest ends, And now the gates where ev'ning Sol descends, And Leucas' rock, and Ocean's utmost streams, This description of the descent into hell is more particular than that in the XIth Odyssey; and each particular is well suited to the subject; the descent is fabled to be by the Ocean, because the sun seems to descend thro' it into Night or the region of darkness, in the western parts of Heaven. Milton fables the Sun to rise through the gates of light, after the manner of the Antients. ? 'Till morn, Wak'd by the circling hours, with rosy hand Unbarr'd the gates of light ? The circumstance likewise of going through the region of dreams is well chosen; Dreams are the attendants of sleep, the brother of death; they come by night, and are therefore well imagined to have relation to the kingdom of death, and to be introductory to it; Virgil in the descent of Æneas into hell, has borrow'd this image, ? Quam sedem somnia vulgo Vana tenere serunt ? The God of sleep there hides his heavy head, And empty dreams on every leaf are spread. The only circumstance liable to objection is, the Leucadian, or white rock, which Aristarchus thought improperly placed in the road to the realms of darkness; but (replies Eustathius) this is only meant of a rock standing on the extremities of the earth, or a rock on which the last rays of the Sun fall. Dacier imagines, that there is a further meaning in the expression: “There is an Island over-against Acarnania, on the west of Ithaca, called Leucas, from a white rock standing in it; this rock was famous in antiquity, because lovers in despair threw themselves from the top of it into the ocean; it was called the Lover's leap, and being thus remarkable for the deaths of numbers of people, Homer places it here.” This is no ill explication; for a rock may well be feign'd to stand at the entrance of the region of death, by which so many persons had enter'd into it. Ovid in his Epistles mentions this Leucadian rock. ? O you that love in vain, Fly hence, and seek the far Leucadian main: There stands a rock from whose impending steep, Apollo's fame surveys the rolling deep; There injur'd lovers, leaping from above, Their flames extinguish, and forget to love. And now pervade the dusky land of Dreams, And rest at last, where souls unbodied dwell In ever-flow'ring meads of Asphodel. The empty Forms of men inhabit there, Impassive semblance, Images of air! Nought else are all that shin'd on earth before; Ajax, and great Achilles, are no more! Yet still a master ghost, the rest he aw'd, The rest ador'd him, tow'ring as he trod; Still at his side is Nestor's son survey'd, And lov'd Patroclus still attends his shade. New as they were to that infernal shore, The Suitors stopp'd, and gaz'd the Heroe o'er. When, moving slow, the regal form they view'd Of great Atrides: Him in pomp pursu'd And solemn sadness thro' the gloom of hell, The train of those who by Ægysthus fell. O mighty chief! (Pelides thus began) This appears to be introduced somewhat unnaturally: Achilles had now been dead about ten years, and Agamemnon almost as long; it can therefore scarce be reconciled to probability, to imagine that they should not have met before this time, and mutually have satisfyed their curiosities, by relating their several stories at some former interview: Dacier indeed remarks, that we are not to imagine this conference was held at the time when the Suitors descended, but upon some preceding occasion, immediately after the death of Agamemnon. If this be allowed, yet the objection remains, that the introduction is forced and unnatural, for then the descent of Mercury and the shades of the Suitors will be no reason why this conference should be here repeated: for so, neither Mercury nor the Suitors hear it. But Dacier is undoubtedly in an error; for ???? in the original is the third person plural, and absolutely refers to Mercury and the shades of the Suitors; and therefore it follows that this conference happen'd at the time of their entrance. The shades of the Suitors (observes Dacier) when they are summoned by Mercury out of the Palace of Ulysses, emit a feeble plaintive, inarticulate sound, ???????? strident: Whereas Agamemnon and the shades that have long been in the state of the dead speak articulately. I doubt not but Homer intended to shew by the former description, that when the soul is separated from the organs of the body, it ceases to act after the same manner, as while it was join'd to it; but how the dead recover their voices afterwards is not easy to understand. In other respects Virgil paints after Homer. ? pars tollere vocem Exiguam: inceptus clamor frustratur hiantes. They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes, But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats, Dryden. But why should we suppose with Dacier, that these shades of the Suitors have lost the faculty of speaking? I rather imagine, that the sounds they uttered were signs of complaint and discontent, and proceeded not from an inability to speak: After Patroclus was slain, he appears to Achilles, and speaks very articulately to him; yet to express his sorrow at his departure he acts like these Suitors: for Achilles Like a thin smoke beholds the spirit fly, And hears a feeble, lamentable cry. Dacier conjectures, that the power of speech ceases in the dead, till they are admitted into a state of rest; but Patroclus is an instance to the contrary in the Iliad, and Elpenor in the Odyssey, for they both speak before their funeral rites are performed, and consequently before they enter into a state of repose amongst the shades of the happy. Honour'd by Jove above the lot of man! King of a hundred Kings! to whom resign'd The strongest, bravest, greatest of mankind. Com'st thou the first, to view this dreary state? And was the noblest the first mark of fate? Condemn'd to pay the great arrear so soon, The lot, which all lament, and none can shun; Oh! better hadst thou sunk in Trojan ground, With all thy full-blown honours cover'd round! Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise Historic marbles to record thy praise: Thy praise eternal on the faithful stone Had with transmissive glories grac'd thy son. But heavier fates were destin'd to attend: What man is happy, till he knows his end? O son of Peleus! greater than mankind! (Thus Agamemnon's kingly shade rejoin'd) Thrice happy thou! to press the martial plain Midst heaps of heroes in thy quarrel slain: In clouds of smoke, rais'd by the noble fray, Great, and terrific ev'n in death you lay, There is a very peculiar beauty in the versification of Homer in this place: ? ?? ?? ??????????? ?????? ????? ????? ?????????. The words ????? ????????? set the largeness of the body of Achilles stretched out upon the ground full before our eyes; we see him in the description; the repetition forces it upon our observation, so that the mind has time to dwell upon it, and admire the extent of the limbs of that Heroe. And deluges of blood flow'd round you ev'ry way. Nor ceas'd the strife, 'till Jove himself oppos'd, And all in tempests the dire evening clos'd. Then to the fleet we bore thy honour'd load, And decent on the fun'ral bed bestow'd. Then unguents sweet and tepid streams we shed; Tears flow'd from ev'ry eye, and o'er the dead Each clipt the curling honours of his head. Struck at the news, thy azure mother came; The sea-green sisters waited on the dame. A voice of loud lament thro' all the main Was heard, and terror seiz'd the Grecian train: This description furnish'd Aristarchus with another objection to this book: He thought it improbable that the appearance of Thetis and her Sea-nymphs should terrify the whole Grecian army; they say in answer, that all the ocean was in a great commotion as Thetis ascended, or as Homer expresses it, ? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ????????. ? This uproar occasion'd their fear; the Greeks were ignorant of the cause of it, and consequently apprehended some dreadful event; this is evident, for Nestor appeases their consternation by unfolding the reason of the tumult, and shewing them that it was occasion'd by the ascent of Thetis. The Reader has undoubtedly observed how excellently Homer sustains his characters; Nestor is the wisest man, both in the Iliad and Odyssey: he has the experience of a very great age, and may therefore be supposed to be acquainted with all the most uncommon appearances in nature: The Poet accordingly describes him as the only person not afraid in the Grecian army; there were others undoubtedly as brave as Nestor, but no one so wise; his intrepidity is therefore to be imputed to his wisdom, not bravery, and this furnishes us with an excellent moral; That ignorance is usually the source of fear. The character of Achilles is no less happily supported; the same love of glory is visible in all he speaks, that distinguished his character thro' the Iliad: he still prefers a short life with fame, before old age without it. ?? ?????? ????? ?????????? ??, ??? ???????, ???? ??? ????? ??????? ??? ?????? ????????. The sentiment is truly heroic; dishonour is worse than death, the happiness or misery of which is not to be measured by time, but glory; long life is but lengthen'd mortality, and they who live the longest have but the small privilege of creeping more leisurely than others to their graves. Back to their ships the frighted host had fled; But Nestor spoke, they listen'd, and obey'd. (From old experience Nestor's counsel springs, And long vicissitudes of human things) “Forbear your flight: Fair Thetis from the main “To mourn Achilles leads her azure train. Around thee stand the daughters of the deep, Robe thee in heav'nly vests, and round thee weep, Round thee, the Muses, with alternate strain, It is impossible (observes Dacier) not to be struck with the noble fictions of Homer in honour of Achilles; every circumstance is great. A whole army is in tears; the Muses celebrate his glory; a Goddess and her Nymphs ennoble it with their presence and lamentations. At the funerals of other Heroes, women and captives are the mourners; here the Muses personally appear. Heaven and Earth, Men and Gods interest themselves in the obsequies of so great an Heroe! Yet from this place Aristarchus draws an argument for rejecting this book: Homer (says he) no where else gives the number of the nine Muses, insinuating that their number was not fix'd in his age; but Homer frequently invokes the Muses, why then should he be ignorant of the number? and if not ignorant of it, why might he not mention it? Aristarchus further adds, that it is absurd to imagine the body of Achilles could be preserv'd seventeen days without burial; but this may be ascribed to the power of Thetis, who may easily be supposed to preserve it. Besides, why might not the body be embalm'd? and then there will be no occasion for a miracle, and the interposition of a Goddess: We must remember what she did to the body of Patroclus in the Iliad. In ever-consecrating verse, complain. Each warlike Greek the moving music hears, And iron-hearted Heroes melt in tears. 'Till sev'nteen nights and sev'nteen days return'd, All that was mortal or immortal mourn'd. To flames we gave thee, the succeeding day, And fatted sheep and sable oxen slay; With oils and honey blaze th' augmented fires, And like a God adorn'd, thy earthly part expires. Unnumber'd warriors round the burning pyle Urge the fleet courser's or the racer's toil; Thick clouds of dust o'er all the circle rise, And the mixt clamour thunders in the skies. Soon as absorpt in all-embracing flame Sunk what was mortal of thy mighty name. We then collect thy snowy bones, and place With wines and unguents in a golden vase. (The vase to Thetis Bacchus gave of old, And Vulcan's art enrich'd the sculptur'd gold) There we thy relicks, great Achilles! blend This is agreeable to the request made to Achilles by the ghost of Patroclus, in the Iliad, Hear then! and as in fate and love we joyn, Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine! That golden Urn thy Goddess mother gave, May mix our ashes in one common grave! It is likewise asserted by Homer, that the bones of Antilochus were reposited in the same urn with those of Patroclus and Achilles; where then is the peculiar honour paid to Patroclus, if Antilochus was partaker of it? The difference is, the bones of Achilles and Patroclus were mix'd in the urn, those of Antilochus lay separately. Homer adds, that the whole army rais'd a monument to Achilles; this is done according to his own injunctions in the Iliad, for speaking of the tomb of Patroclus, he thus proceeds; Mean-time erect the tomb with pious hands, A common structure on the humble sands; Hereafter Greece, some nobler work may raise, And late posterity record our praise. Achilles means, that when he is dead the Greeks should raise one common monument to himself and Patroclus, which we see here effected. With dear Patroclus, thy departed friend: In the same urn a sep'rate space contains Thy next belov'd, Antilochus' remains. Now all the sons of warlike Greece surround Thy destin'd tomb, and cast a mighty mound: High on the shore the growing hill we raise, That wide th' extended Hellespont surveys; Where all, from age to age who pass the coast, May point Achilles' tomb, and hail the mighty ghost. Thetis her self to all our peers proclaims Heroic prizes and exequial games; The Gods assented; and around thee lay Rich spoils and gifts that blaz'd against the day. Oft have I seen with solemn fun'ral games Heroes and Kings committed to the flames; But strength of youth, or valour of the brave With nobler contest ne'er renown'd a grave. Such were the games by azure Thetis given, And such thy honours, oh belov'd of heaven! Dear to mankind thy fame survives, nor fades Its bloom eternal in the Stygian shades. But what to me avail my honours gone, Successful toils, and battles bravely won? Doom'd by stern Jove, at home to end my life, By curst Ægysthus, and a faithless wife! Thus they; while Hermes o'er the dreary plain Led the sad numbers by Ulysses slain. On each majestic form they cast a view, And tim'rous pass'd, and awfully withdrew. But Agamemnon, thro' the gloomy shade, An objection has been rais'd against this passage, and it has been thought an absurdity that Agamemnon should be the guest of Amphimedon, and not of Ulysses, when he came to make an address to him, and was within his territories. Didymus answers, that this conduct in Agamemnon was occasion'd by the refusal of Ulysses to assist in the war of Troy: Agamemnon resented his denial, and went to the house of Amphimedon. His antient host Amphimedon survey'd; Son of Melanthus! (he began) O say! What cause compell'd so many, and so gay, To tread the downward, melancholy way? Say, could one city yield a troop so fair? Were all the partners of one native air? Or did the rage of stormy Neptune sweep Your lives at once, and whelm beneath the deep? Did nightly thieves, or Pyrates cruel bands, Drench with your blood your pillag'd country's sands? Or well-defending some beleaguer'd wall, Say, for the publick did ye greatly fall? Inform thy guest; for such I was of yore When our triumphant navies touch'd your shore; Forc'd a long month the wintry seas to bear, It is not obvious why Ulysses, who was a person of the greatest bravery, should be unwilling to engage in such an action of glory, as the war of Troy: Was it because he foresaw that it would be a work of danger, (as Eustathius imagines) or was he dissatisfy'd in the ground of it, which was only to revenge the rape of Helen, and nothing but a private injury? the former is a reason unworthy of his heroic character, the latter is no more than a conjecture. It may possibly be a truer reason that he was unwilling to forsake his wife, of whom he was very fond, and whom he newly had married; but then it must be allow'd, that he prefers his love to his glory. Eustathius recites the manner how he was drawn to engage in the war of Troy: Ulysses, to deliver himself from the importunities of his friends to assist Agamemnon, pretended madness, and yok'd two animals of a different kind to a plough, and began to work with them; Palamedes, who suspected the imposture, took his son Telemachus, an infant, and laid him in the furrow before the plough; Ulysses turn'd aside not to hurt his child, and this discovered the imposition. Aristotle takes notice of the great judgment of Homer in suppressing this incident concerning Ulysses, it being unworthy of the bravery of an Heroe: He is proving, Chap. 8. of his Poetics, that all the actions of an Heroe's life are not to be inserted in an Epic Poem, for the actions of the same man are so many and different, that we can never reduce them to unity: For this reason Homer mentions not all the adventures of Ulysses, but only such as have relation to the subject of the Odyssey; he knew that this counterfeit madness had no connexion either in truth or probability with the subject of his Poem, and therefore he forbears the mention of it. The Reader will understand the meaning of Aristotle, if he considers that the subject of the Odyssey is the story of a person who suffers great calamities in the return to his country, before he establishes himself in his dominions: Now the counterfeited madness of Ulysses has no connection with these sufferings, and consequently is judiciously omitted by Homer as foreign to the design of the Poem, and contrary to the unity of the action. A detail of all the adventures of an Heroe's life is the province of History; the relation of one single, great, and surprizing action is the subject of Epic Poetry. To move the great Ulysses to the war. O King of men! I faithful shall relate (Reply'd Amphimedon) our hapless fate. Ulysses absent, our ambitious aim With rival loves pursu'd his royal Dame; Her coy reserve, and prudence mixt with pride, Our common suit nor granted, nor deny'd; But close with inward hate our deaths design'd; Vers'd in all arts of wily womankind. Her hand, laborious in delusion, spread A spacious loom, and mix'd the various thread; Ye Peers (she cry'd) who press to gain my heart Where dead Ulysses claims no more a part, Yet a short space, your rival suit suspend, 'Till this funereal web my labours end: Cease, till to good Laertes I bequeath A task of grief, his ornaments of death: Lest, when the Fates his royal ashes claim, The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame; Should he, long honour'd with supreme command, Want the last duties of a daughter's hand. The fiction pleas'd: our gen'rous train complies, Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise. The work she ply'd; but studious of delay, Each following night revers'd the toils of day. Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail; The fourth, her maid reveal'd th' amazing tale, And show'd, as unperceiv'd we took our stand, The backward labours of her faithless hand. Forc'd, she compleats it; and before us lay The mingled web, whose gold and silver ray Display'd the radiance of the night and day, Just as she finish'd her illustrious toil, Ill fortune led Ulysses to our isle. Far in a lonely nook, beside the sea, At an old swineherd's rural lodge he lay: Thither his son from sandy Pyle repairs, And speedy lands, and secretly confers. They plan our future ruin, and resort Confed'rate, to the city and the court. First came the son; the father next succeeds, Clad like a beggar, whom Eumæus leads; Propt on a staff, deform'd with age and care, And hung with rags, that flutter'd in the air. Who could Ulysses in that form behold? Scorn'd by the young, forgotten by the old, Ill-us'd by all! to ev'ry wrong resign'd, Patient he suffer'd with a constant mind. But when, arising in his wrath t'obey The will of Jove, he gave the vengeance way; The scatter'd arms that hung around the dome Careful he treasur'd in a private room: Then, to her Suitors bade his Queen propose We have already seen, that it was the contrivance of Penelope to propose the Bow, to gain time to defer the marriage hour; how then comes Amphimedon to ascribe it to the art of Ulysses? Eustathius answers that Amphimedon is in an error, and that tho' the contrivance was from Penelope, yet Amphimedon could not come to the knowledge of it; and such stratagems being agreeable to the character of Ulysses, he imputes this action to him rather than Penelope. It is impossible not to take notice that Homer makes repetition after repetition: Agamemnon speaks the same words as in the eleventh Odyssey: Amphimedon the same as in the second; and the whole account of the Suitors' destruction is no more than a recital of what the Reader already knows. Was Homer tir'd at the end of his work, and would not give himself the labour of invention? I confess we may lose our appetite to see the same entertainment thus continually serv'd up in the very same manner, without so much as a new garnishment. I fear the words of Ulysses may sometimes be applicable to Homer. And what so tedious as a twice-told tale? Besides, this whole infernal interview is merely ornamental, which the Poet was at liberty to insert or omit according to his judgment, without breaking the thread of the principal action; it might therefore be wish'd that he had substituted some other incident in the room of it, and given a greater diversity to the story: If by laying the scene in Hell, he design'd to raise the wonder and curiosity of the Reader, (who cannot fail of having his attention awaken'd to see a prospect open'd beyond the bounds of nature, and to look into the state of departed Heroes) yet it must be confess'd that this design has already been fully executed in the eleventh of the Odyssey. But the Poet seems to introduce the descent for the information of the dead rather than the living; Agamemnon is told how the Suitors were destroyed by Ulysses; and Achilles how nobly the Greeks perform'd his funeral obsequies; incidents that very little contribute to the story of the Odyssey. In short, the main action stands still during this whole Episode, which takes up almost half the book, and the latter part of the Episode presents no new object to amuse and entertain us. But, ? Cynthius aurem Vellit ? I betray my own want of judgment, rather than discover Homer's errors. I will only add, that the Reader will be fully convinc'd that this whole Episode may be omitted, by observing how well the story will be carried on with a regular connection by beginning the book with these words, ? ?? ???? ?? ?????? ???????, ????? ?? ????? ??????, &amp;c. So that if I could in any part subscribe to the opinion of Aristarchus for the rejection of this book, it should be only for the former part of it, but I am persuaded from the nobleness of the verses, that the whole is genuine. The Archer's strife: the source of future woes, And Omen of our death! In vain we drew The twanging string, and try'd the stubborn yew: To none it yields but great Ulysses' hands; In vain we threat; Telemachus commands: The Bow he snatch'd, and in an instant bent; Thro' ev'ry ring the victor arrow went. Fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood; Pour'd forth the darts, that thirsted for our blood, And frown'd before us, dreadful as a God! First bleeds Antinous: thick the shafts resound; And heaps on heaps the wretches strow the ground; This way, and that, we turn, we fly, we fall; Some God assisted, and unmann'd us all: Ignoble cries precede thy dying groans; And batter'd brains and blood besmear the stones. Thus great Atrides! thus Ulysses drove The shades thou seest, from yon' fair realms above. Our mangled bodies now deform'd with gore, Cold and neglected, spread the marble floor. No friend to bathe our wounds! or tears to shed O'er the pale corse! the honours of the dead. Oh blest Ulysses (thus the King exprest His sudden rapture) in thy Consort blest! Not more thy wisdom, than her virtue, shin'd; Not more thy patience, than her constant mind. Icarius' daughter, glory of the past, And model to the future age, shall last: The Gods, to honour her fair fame, shall raise (Their great reward) a Poet in her praise. Not such, oh Tyndarus! thy daughter's deed, By whose dire hand her King and husband bled: Her shall the Muse to infamy prolong, Example dread! and theme of tragic song! The gen'ral sex shall suffer in her shame, And ev'n the best that bears a Woman's name. Thus in the regions of eternal shade I think it will not be improper here to particularize from whence Antiquity rais'd the fictions concerning Hell, and the nature of it, as we have it in Diodorus Siculus. Pluto (observes that Author) was the first that introduced the rites of sepulture, and other ceremonies bestow'd on the dead: This is the reason why the Antients imagin'd him to be the King of the dead. Rhadamanthus is said to have been the most just man in the world, he severely punish'd robbers and other notorious offenders, and from his singular reputation for integrity was feign'd to be the judge of the good and bad after death; and for the same reason Minos was joyn'd with him in the same dignity. Homer borrow'd his fictions from Orpheus, Orpheus from the Ægyptians: it was Orpheus who introduc'd the opinion of the pains of the damn'd, and of the Elysian fields, and taught that the souls of the dead were conducted by Mercury into the infernal mansions: (a proof that he was call'd ?????????? before the days of Homer.) Diodorus proceeds and mentions the beginning of this book, how Homer feigns that Mercury leads the shades of the dead by the Ocean, the Leucadian rock, and the gates of the sun: A plain instance that he look'd upon this book as the genuine work of Homer. All these fables (continues Diodorus) are of Ægyptian extract; by the Ocean, Homer means Nilus; by the gates of the sun, he means Heliopolis, a city sacred to the Sun; the meadow into which the shades are conducted, denotes the pleasant meadows full of canes adjoining to Memphis; and the dead are feign'd to reside there, because it was the general burial place amongst the Ægyptians. Concerning Cocytus, Acheron, &amp;c. the Reader may consult the first Note upon the eleventh Odyssey. Plutarch in his treatise of Isis and Osyris agrees with Diodorus concerning the extraction of these fables from Ægypt, and mentions at Memphis the gates of lamentation and oblivion; that is, of Lethe, and Cocytus; which being open'd at the burial of the dead, give a doleful and groaning sound. From hence they are thus describ'd by Homer in the tenth Odyssey. And where slow rolling from the Stygian bed Cocytus' lamentable waters spread, Where the dark rock o'erhangs th' infernal lake, And mingling streams eternal murmurs make. These observations give light to most of Homer's fictions concerning hell, and shew that his Poetry is built upon the customs of Antiquity. Macrobius explains all these particulars after a different manner: This solution supposes a state of pre-existence of the soul: If (says that Author) “To die, be the same as to go to the infernal regions; to enjoy the supernal, is then to live; and therefore before Philosophy prevail'd, the body it self was suppos'd to be the infernal receptacle of the Soul, into which she descended as into a prison, from above; this was thought the sepulchre of the Soul, and the cave of Pluto. The river of Oblivion denotes the error of the soul, which forgets the majesty of the former state she enjoy'd before she enter'd the body: Phlegethon, the ardor of our desires, and flames of anger; Acheron all our words and actions that bring us into sorrows; so likewise, Styx implies our hatred, Cocytus our grief and lamentation. Thus also the punishments in hell are verify'd upon earth: the Vultur which preys upon the liver of Tityus, is the sting of a guilty conscience; the ambitious man is the Sisyphus, who is eternally aspiring, and yet always disappointed; the avaritious man is the Tantalus who starves amidst his plenty, &amp;c. By joining these two interpretations together, we have at once the double pleasure of a beautiful fable and instructive moral; from the whole we may collect, that altho' the antients were ignorant of the true nature of a future state, yet that they believed it, and expected there would be punishments and rewards in it. This note is of use to explain several passages in the eleventh Odyssey. Conferr'd the mournful Phantoms of the dead. While from the town, Ulysses, and his band, Past to Laertes' cultivated land. The ground himself had purchas'd with his pain, Eustathius very well explains these words, in which the Greek may be construed to signify that Laertes had purchased this place of his retirement by his labour and industry: But probably Homer intends to express an allotment or portion of ground which was assign'd Laertes by the public, as a reward for his heroic labours in war, and bravery in conquering his enemies, like that mentioned in the Iliad. The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground, With woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd. It may either be so, or Homer intending solely to paint the laborious life of Laertes, added this circumstance of his encreasing his rural cell by his industry, as an instance of it; tho' the latter is more suitable to the character of a King. And labour made the rugged soil a plain. There stood his mansion of the rural sort, With useful buildings round the lowly court: Where the few servants that divide his care, Took their laborious rest, and homely fare; And one Sicilian matron, old and sage, With constant duty tends his drooping age. Here now arriving, to his rustic band And martial son, Ulysses gave command. Enter the house, and of the bristly swine Select the largest to the pow'rs divine. Alone, and unattended, let me try If yet I share the old man's memory: If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know, (Their light and dearest object long ago) Now chang'd with time, with absence, and with woe? Then to his train he gives his spear and shield; The house they enter, and he seeks the field; Thro' rows of shade with various fruitage crown'd, And labour'd scenes of richest verdure round. Nor aged Dolius, nor his sons were there, Nor servants, absent on another care; To search the woods for sets of flow'ry thorn, Their orchard-bounds to strengthen and adorn. But all alone the hoary King he found; His habit coarse, but warmly wrapt around; His head, that bow'd with many a pensive care, Fenc'd with a double cap of goatskin hair: His buskins old, in former service torn, But well repair'd; and gloves against the thorn. Casaubon in his Remarks upon Athenæus, lib. 12. cap. 2. affirms, that anciently neither the Greeks nor the Romans ever wore any covering on their hands, which are now used so universally, that they are worn by the meanest people; but this place is an instance of Casaubon's mistake: 'Tis true, Xenophon gives this practice as an argument of the luxury and delicacy of the Persians, who suffered no part of the body to be expos'd to the air, but wore ??? ???? ?????? ???? ????? ????????, ??? ??????????? ??????, “gloves upon their hands, and coverings on their very fingers.” Pliny the Younger mentions the same custom amongst the Romans, Manus Hieme manicis muniebantur! ut ne cœli quidem asperitas ullum studiis tempus eriperet. This then is the difference; the Persians wore these hand-coverings out of effeminacy and delicacy: whereas in Greece they were used only out of necessity, as a defence in rural labour, as appears from Laertes, they being never mention'd upon any other occasion, either in the Iliad or Odyssey. Dacier. In this array the kingly Gard'ner stood, This is the first appearance of Laertes, he is the very picture of melancholy, his dress, his employ, and solitary life all discover a fix'd sorrow and contempt of the world. It has been a dispute whether we are to ascribe this retreat of Laertes to a meanness of spirit, who forsakes his station, and is unequal to adversity; or to wisdom, and a noble neglect of the pomp and splendor of the world, by which he prefers a little rural retreat to all the magnificence of a Palace, and a small garden to all the dominions of a King. Plutarch severely censures his conduct: “A person (observes that writer) who wastes his age in his bed, or in trivial affairs, makes himself an object of contempt, as Homer teaches by the examples of Nestor and Laertes: Nestor, by engaging in the war of Troy, obtain'd the utmost veneration; while Laertes, who abandon'd himself to solitude, was despis'd universally.” I am unwilling to subscribe to this observation, being of opinion that the silent virtues of a good man in solitude are more amiable than all the noisy honours of active life. The picture of Laertes is undoubtedly drawn very naturally; a tender father is afflicted for the loss of a brave and beloved son, this bitter ingredient gives a disrelish to all the vanities of life; he is depriv'd of an object that he valued above the world, he therefore neglects it as having nothing worthy of his cares, and abandons it for privacy and tranquillity. Menodemus in Terence is the very copy of Laertes in Homer; an instance that he thought Homer's an exact representation of human nature: and the applause with which that Comedy was received, shews that all Rome was of the same judgment. Sorrow loves to be alone, rather seeks for amusements than business and glory; and it may perhaps be true, that it shews more greatness of soul to resign a kingdom than to conquer it. Pride, ambition, and guilty passions have rais'd many to the top of human glory; but it evidences that a person is not influenc'd by vicious sentiments, who knows how to moderate his desires, and is able to retire from the splendor of a Crown into obscurity. Tully mentions the manner of life in Laertes, without condemnation; the place is to be found in his Cato Major, where he speaks of the innocent amusements of old age, and illustrates his assertions by the example of Laertes. Homerus Laertem lenientem desiderium, quod capiebat e filio, colentem agrum &amp; stercorantem facit. But Tully mistakes Homer, for Laertes is not found dunging his ground. Perhaps instead of ???????????, he read ??????????, as it is used in the seventeenth Odyssey. ? ???????? ??????? ???? ???????????. Or perhaps he quoted by memory. I will only add, that Tully in his retirement at Tusculum, used to write to his friends, that he there led the life of Laertes: and Tully was too sensible of his own worth, to speak any thing to the disparagement of it. And clear'd a Plant, encumber'd with its wood. Beneath a neighb'ring tree, the chief divine Gaz'd o'er his Sire, retracing ev'ry line, The ruins of himself! now worn away With age, yet still majestic in decay! Sudden his eyes releas'd their wat'ry store; The much-enduring man could bear no more. Doubtful he stood, if instant to embrace His aged limbs, to kiss his rev'rend face, With eager transport to disclose the whole, And pour at once the torrent of his soul? Not so: his judgment takes the winding way It has been objected, that Ulysses here acts contrary to filial piety, and permits a tender father to continue in his sorrows, when it was in his power immediately to make him happy, by a discovery of his person; they likewise condemn the ???????? ????, which Homer puts into the mouth of Ulysses. It must be allow'd, that those words are frequently us'd by the Poet in a bad sense, and signify heart-wounding, or reproachful words; but here they are not so to be understood; they only imply, that Ulysses blamed Laertes out of tenderness for taking no more care of his person: This is not a reproach, but the language of fondness and affection: or perhaps the Poet meant to express that this enquiry rais'd images of sorrow in the soul of Laertes, and wounded his heart by naming the lost Ulysses. Eustathius solves the former objection by saying that Ulysses delayed the discovery, lest the suddenness of joy should prove fatal to Laertes. But Homer undoubtedly paints according to nature; Ulysses bursts into tears at the sight of his father, yet restrains them, and tries if after twenty years absence he was known by him; this delay raises the Reader's curiosity, makes him, as it were, present at the interview, and impatient to hear the manner of the discovery: Besides, this procedure excellently agrees with the general character of Ulysses, who is upon all emergencies master of his passions, and remarkable for disguise and an artful dissimulation; this disguise has a very happy effect in this place, it holds us in a pleasing suspence, and makes us wait with attention to see the issue of the interview. Of question distant, and of soft essay, More gentle methods on weak age employs, And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys. Then to his Sire with beating heart he moves, And with a tender pleasantry reproves: Who digging round the plant still hangs his head, Nor ought remits the work, while thus he said. Great is thy skill, oh father! great thy toil, Thy careful hand is stamp'd on all the soil, Thy squadron'd vineyards well thy art declare, The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear; And not one empty spot escapes thy care. On ev'ry plant and tree thy cares are shown, Nothing neglected, but thy self alone. Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame; Age so advanc'd may some indulgence claim. Not for thy sloth, I deem thy Lord unkind; Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind: I read a Monarch in that princely air, The words in the Greek are not without obscurity, and Eustathius explains them two ways; they may either signify, that Laertes appears to be a person of such distinction that he ought to live with more delicacy and dignity, viz. to bath, and after a due repast to sleep in state; or they imply, that Laertes shews the dignity of a King in his person, who comes from the bath, and dines in state. Ulysses cannot compare Laertes to a King who is fresh from the bath, and drest royally, for he tells us, he is cover'd with sweat and dust; he therefore means that his personage is noble, and like a King, that therefore he ought to live like a King, with respect to his food and his bath, and to indulge his age by allowing it ease and refreshment. The same thy aspect, if the same thy care; Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine, These are the rights of age, and should be thine. Who then thy master, say? and whose the land So dress'd and manag'd by thy skilful hand? But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most) Is this the far-fam'd Ithacensian coast? For so reported the first man I view'd, (Some surly Islander, of manners rude) Nor farther conference vouchsaf'd to stay; Heedless he whistled, and pursu'd his way. But thou! whom years have taught to understand, Humanely hear, and answer my demand: A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave, Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave? Time was (my fortunes then were at the best) When at my house I lodg'd this foreign guest; He said, from Ithaca's fair isle he came, And old Laertes was his father's name. To him, whatever to a guest is ow'd I paid, and hospitable gifts bestow'd; To him sev'n talents of pure ore I told, Twelve cloaks, twelve vests, twelve tunicks stiff with gold, A bowl, that rich with polish'd silver flames, And, skill'd in female works, four lovely dames. At this the Father, with a father's fears: (His venerable eyes bedimm'd with tears) This is the land; but ah! thy gifts are lost, For godless men, and rude, possess the coast: Sunk is the glory of this once-fam'd shore! Thy antient friend, oh stranger, is no more! Full recompence thy bounty else had born; For ev'ry good man yields a just return: So civil rights demand; and who begins The track of friendship, not pursuing, sins. But tell me, stranger, be the truth confest, What years have circled since thou saw'st that guest? That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone! Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son! If ever man to misery was born, 'Twas his to suffer, and 'tis mine to mourn! Far from his friends, and from his native reign, He lies a prey to monsters of the main, Or savage beasts his mangled reliques tear, Or screaming vulturs scatter thro' the air: Nor could his mother fun'ral unguents shed, Nor wail'd his father o'er th' untimely dead, Nor his sad consort, on the mournful bier, Seal'd his cold eyes, or drop'd a tender tear! But tell me, who thou art? and what thy race? Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place? Or if a merchant in pursuit of gain, What port receiv'd thy vessel from the main: Or com'st thou single, or attend thy train? Then thus the Son. From Alybas I came, Ulysses is inexhaustible in his fictions; he here accommodates the names of persons and places to his fortunes: Alybas is suppos'd to be a city of Italy, afterwards call'd Metapontium. It is plac'd by others in Thrace. It is here introduc'd to denote, the wandrings of Ulysses by the sea, or ???: the word Aphidas denotes his generosity, which spares nothing towards his friends. He feigns himself to be the grandson of ?????????, to represent the multitude of his sufferings; his name is Eperitus, from ?????????, the same with ??????????? from ?????, to shew the struggle that he has met with in all his adventures, as well as the toils in the war of Troy, and against other enemies. Eustathius. My palace there; Eperitus my name. Not vulgar born, from Aphidas the King Of Polyphemon's royal line I spring. Some adverse Dæmon from Sicania bore Our wandring course, and drove us on your shore: Far from the town, an unfrequented bay Reliev'd our weary'd vessel from the sea. Five years have circled since these eyes pursu'd Ulysses parting thro' the sable flood; Prosp'rous he sail'd, with dexter Auguries, And all the wing'd good omens of the skies. Well hop'd we then to meet on this fair shore, Whom heav'n, alas! decreed to meet no more. Quick thro' the father's heart these accents ran; Grief seiz'd at once, and wrapt up all the man; Deep from his soul he sigh'd, and sorrowing spread This was a common practice amongst the antient orientals, in token of the extremity of sorrow; it was used amongst the Hebrews as well as Greeks; thus Ezek. xxvii. 30. They shall cast dust upon their heads. Job ii. 12. They rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads. Thus also Achilles in the eighteenth of the Iliad; His purple garments, and his golden hairs, Those he deforms in dust, and these he tears. Homer calls it ????? ???????????, which does not mean that Laertes threw glowing embers on his head, for he was in his garden, where such ashes were not to be found, but he means ?????, or dry dust, such as arises from substances consum'd by fire, or resembling ashes. Eustathius. A cloud of ashes on his hoary head. Trembling with agonies of strong delight The Greek expression is remarkable, ? ??? ????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ????? ???????? ? A sharp sensation struck his nostrils. Eustathius judges, that the meaning is, that Ulysses perceived himself ready to burst into tears; a kind of a pricking sharp sensation being felt in the nostrils before the erruption of tears. Casaubon more fully explains it; he observes that all violent passions cause a sensation in the nostrils, arising from the ebullition of the spirits, which mount toward the brain, and endeavouring to free themselves from restraint find a vent by the nostril, and crouding thro' it, dilate it in their passage; this is evident from animals, and the nobler kinds of them, as the bull, the horse, the lion, whose nostrils always dilate when mov'd to anger. A similar expression is found in the first Idyllium of Theocritus. ??? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ???? ???? ???????. He speaks of the anger of the God Pan, but it is applicable to all violence of passion. Aristotle (observes Dacier) quotes this verse as apply'd by Homer to express anger, Cap. 8. of his morals to Nicomachus, but he is evidently in an error; for there is here no mention of anger: he undoudtedly trusted to his memory, it being sorrow arising from filial tenderness which moves Ulysses. Dacier. Stood the great son, heart-wounded with the sight: He ran, he seiz'd him with a strict embrace, With thousand kisses wander'd o'er his face, I, I am he; oh father rise! behold Thy son, with twenty winters now grown old; Thy son, so long desir'd, so long detain'd, Restor'd, and breathing in his native land. These floods of sorrow, oh my Sire, restrain! The vengeance is compleat; the Suitor-train, Stretch'd in our palace, by these hands lie slain. Amaz'd, Laertes. “Give some certain sign, “(If such thou art) to manifest thee mine.” Lo here the wound (he cries) receiv'd of yore, The scar indented by the tusky boar, Whereby thy self and by Anticlia sent, To old Autolychus's realms I went. Yet by another sign thy offspring know; The sev'ral trees you gave me long ago, The word in the original is ???????, which signifies a very young boy: Homer uses it to express the age, when out of a childish simplicity Ulysses ask'd his father to grant him such trees. Such requests are very natural in children, and we see (says Dacier) the same practis'd every day; Parents out of fondness indulge the requests of their children in such little particularities, and a bird, an horse, &amp;c. continues the child's favourite for many years. It must be allow'd, that no Poet ever follow'd nature so faithfully as Homer. Virgil perhaps has reach'd his noblest elevations and sublimities, but there is a greater variety of natural incidents, more exact pictures of human life in Homer than in all other Poets. Some Painters excel in the boldness of their figures, and know how to draw a Heroe or a God, but are less happy in lower subjects; but Homer draws universally, and is excellent upon all occasions; he paints the largest figures or the least sketches equally natural, and with equal beauty. While, yet a child, these fields I lov'd to trace, And trod thy footsteps with unequal pace: To ev'ry plant in order as we came, Well-pleas'd you told its nature, and its name, Whate'er my childish fancy ask'd, bestow'd; Twelve pear-trees bowing with their pendent load, And ten, that red with blushing apples glow'd; Full fifty purple figs; and many a row Of various vines that then began to blow, A future vintage! when the Hours produce Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice. Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain, His heart within him melts; his knees sustain Their feeble weight no more; his arms alone Support him, round the lov'd Ulysses thrown; He faints, he sinks, with mighty joys opprest: Ulysses clasps him to his eager breast. Soon as returning life regains its seat, And his breath lengthens, and his pulses beat; Yes, I believe (he cries) almighty Jove! Heav'n rules us yet, and Gods there are above. 'Tis so—the Suitors for their wrongs have paid— But what shall guard us, if the town invade? If, while the news thro' ev'ry city flies, All Ithaca and Cephalenia rise? To this Ulysses. As the Gods shall please Be all the rest; and set thy soul at ease. Haste to the cottage by this orchard side, And take the banquet which our cares provide: There wait thy faithful band of rural friends, And there the young Telemachus attends. Thus having said, they trac'd the garden o'er, And stooping enter'd at the lowly door. The swains and young Telemachus they found, The victim portion'd, and the goblet crown'd. The hoary King his old Sicilian maid Perfum'd and wash'd, and gorgeously array'd. Pallas attending gives his frame to shine With awful port, and majesty divine; His gazing son admires the god-like grace, And air celestial dawning o'er his face. What God, he cry'd, my father's form improves? How high he treads, and how enlarg'd he moves? Oh! Would to all the deathless pow'rs on high, Pallas and Jove, and him who gilds the sky! (Reply'd the King elated with his praise) My strength were still, as once in better days: When the bold Cephalens the leaguer form'd, And proud Nericus trembled as I storm'd. I doubt not but the Reader has observ'd, that Laertes uses the very turn of language and manner of self-condemnation so remarkable in almost all the speeches of Nestor: this is to be ascribed to the nature of old age in general, which loves a little to boast, and relates the exploits of youth with the utmost satisfaction; or as Horace describes it, ? Laudator temporis acti Se puero ? I will only add, that the reason why Homer describes Laertes enlarg'd with strength and majesty by Minerva is to reconcile the future story to probability; Laertes acts the Heroe, engages at the head of his friends, and kills the leader of his enemies; this might appear to be an exploit too great for a weak old man wasted away with sorrows: the Poet therefore knowing that he had lost his natural vigour thro' age supplies the defect with preternatural strength, and by this method renders him equal to his future actions. Such were I now, not absent from your deed When the last sun beheld the Suitors bleed, This arm had aided yours; this hand bestrown Our floors with death, and push'd the slaughter on; Nor had the Sire been sep'rate from the Son. They commun'd thus; while homeward bent their way The swains, fatigu'd with labours of the day; Dolius the first, the venerable man, And next his sons, a long-succeeding train, For due refection to the bow'r they came, Call'd by the careful old Sicilian dame, Who nurs'd the children, and now tends the sire; We are not to imagine that this Sicilian was the wife of Dolius; Homer gives her the title of mother to his children, because she had the care of their education; for he adds, ? ????? ?????, she was their nurse, not their mother. Dacier. They see their Lord, they gaze, and they admire. On chairs and beds in order seated round, They share the gladsome board; the roofs resound. While thus Ulysses to his antient friend: “Forbear your wonder, and the feast attend; “The rites have waited long.” The chief commands Their loves in vain; old Dolius spreads his hands, Springs to his master with a warm embrace, And fastens kisses on his hands and face: Then thus broke out. Oh long, oh daily mourn'd! Beyond our hopes, and to our wish, return'd! Conducted sure by heav'n! for heav'n alone Could work this wonder: welcome to thy own! And joys and happiness attend thy throne! Who knows thy blest, thy wish'd return? oh say, To the chast Queen shall we the news convey? Or hears she, and with blessings loads the day? Dismiss that care, for to the royal bride Already is it known (the King reply'd, And strait resum'd his seat) while round him bows Each faithful youth, and breathes out ardent vows: Then all beneath their father take their place, Rank'd by their ages, and the banquet grace. Now flying Fame the swift report had spread Thro' all the city, of the Suitors dead. In throngs they rise, and to the palace crowd; Their sighs were many, and the tumult loud. Weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain, Inhume the natives in their native plain, The rest in ships are wafted o'er the main. To understand this we must remember, that many of the Suitors came from the neighbouring Islands, Samos, Zacynthus, &amp;c. and therefore they are said to be transported by sea, to be buried in their native countries: this custom prevail'd over all the oriental world: But there may be a particular reason why this is done by the Ithacans; they might intend to raise those several Islands to engage against Ulysses, and draw them to arms by such moving spectacles. Dacier. Then sad in council all the Seniors sate, Frequent and full, assembled to debate. Amid the circle first Eupithes rose, Big was his eye with tears, his heart with woes: The bold Antinous was his age's pride, The first who by Ulysses' arrow dy'd. Down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran, As mixing words with sighs, he thus began. Great deeds, oh friends! this wond'rous man has wrought, And mighty blessings to his country brought. With ships he parted and a num'rous train, Those, and their ships he bury'd in the main. Now he returns, and first essays his hand In the best blood of all his native land. Haste then, and ere to neighb'ring Pyle he flies, Or sacred Elis, to procure supplies; Arise (or ye for ever fall) arise! Shame to this age, and all that shall succeed! If unreveng'd your sons and brothers bleed. Prove that we live, by vengeance on his head, Or sink at once forgotten with the dead. Here ceas'd he, but indignant tears let fall Spoke when he ceas'd: dumb sorrow touch'd them all. When from the Palace to the wond'ring throng Sage Medon came, and Phemius came along; (Restless and early sleep's soft bands they broke) And Medon first th' assembled chiefs bespoke. Hear me, ye Peers and Elders of the land, There is great art in the speeches of Medon and Eupithes: Eupithes said that Ulysses had slain the bravest of the Greeks; Medon allows it, but adds, that it was done by the will of the Gods: the consequence therefore is, that to fight against Ulysses upon this account, is to fight against the Gods. Eupithes applies to their revenge, Medon to their fears; Eupithes sheds tears to move their compassion, Medon intimidates them by averring that the assistance of the Gods was visible on the side of Ulysses. The persons likewise whom Homer employs to plead against Eupithes are well chosen; Halitherses is a Prophet, Medon an Herald, and both persons esteem'd sacred by their offices; this is the reason why the Greeks are said to be struck with awe at their appearance. Dacier, &amp;c. Who deem this act the work of mortal hand; As o'er the heaps of death Ulysses strode, These eyes, these eyes beheld a present God, Who now before him, now beside him stood, Fought as he fought, and mark'd his way with blood: In vain old Mentor's form the God bely'd, 'Twas heav'n that struck, and heav'n was on his side. A sudden horror all th' assembly shook, When slowly rising, Halitherses spoke: The speech of Medon had a good effect upon the audience; for Homer adds, that the whole assembly grew afraid; Halitherses perceived it, and seconds it. He insists upon a new head of persuasion, and sets forth the justice of the late action of Ulysses: the Suitors were slain (says he) for their crimes, and you are guilty for not restraining their outrages; and then to deter them from their present designs, he represents their danger in engaging against their King. From these speeches (observes Eustathius) Homer draws the probability of the future part of the story; he divides the enemy, and wins over almost half of their numbers; whereas, had they proceeded unanimously, Ulysses must necessarily have perish'd by their power. It is observable, that tho' Phemius accompanies Medon, yet he is silent; the reason is, he as it were speaks by the mouth of Medon, he was witness to the assistance of heav'n on the part of Ulysses, and approves and confirms by his presence the truth of his testimony. It is thus on the stage where the whole Chorus was antiently suppos'd to speak by the mouth of their Prolocutor. Dacier, &amp;c. (Rev'rend and wise, whose comprehensive view At once the present and the future knew) Me to ye fathers hear! from you proceed The ills ye mourn; your own the guilty deed. Ye gave your sons, your lawless sons the rein, (Oft warn'd by Mentor and my self in vain) An absent Heroe's bed they sought to soil, An absent Heroe's wealth they made their spoil: Immod'rate riot, and intemp'rate lust! Th' offence was great, the punishment was just. Weigh then my counsels in an equal scale, Nor rush to ruin. Justice will prevail. His mod'rate words some better minds persuade: They part, and join him; but the number stay'd. They storm, they shout, with hasty frenzy fir'd, And second all Eupithes' rage inspir'd. They case their limbs in brass; to arms they run; The broad effulgence blazes in the sun. Before the city, and in ample plain, They meet: Eupithes heads the frantic train. Fierce for his son, he breathes his threats in air; Fate hears them not, and Death attends him there. This past on earth, while in the realms above Minerva thus to cloud-compelling Jove. Homer, to give importance to the conclusive action of his Poem, introduces Jupiter and Minerva in debate about the event of it. At the beginning of the Odyssey he describes the Gods in consultation for the re-establishment of Ulysses: In the conclusion of it, we see Jupiter himself rewarding the virtue and bravery of Ulysses, and decreeing him to reign in peace and tranquillity. This is carry'd on with great judgment: we are fully satisfy'd that the action of the Odyssey is compleated in the happiness of the Heroe, when we hear Jupiter giving his sanction to it. Besides, it leaves a noble image of the greatness of Ulysses, and of the whole story of the Odyssey, upon the Reader's mind, when we see it is of such weight as to engage Jupiter in its favour. Thus in imitation of Homer, toward the conclusion of the Æneid, Virgil describes Jupiter and Juno in debate concerning the decisive action between Turnus and Æneas. May I presume to search thy secret soul? Oh Pow'r supreme, oh ruler of the whole! Say, hast thou doom'd to this divided state Or peaceful amity, or stern debate? Declare thy purpose; for thy will is Fate. Is not thy thought my own? (the God replies Who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies) Had not long since thy knowing soul decreed, The Chief's return should make the guilty bleed? 'Tis done, and at thy will the Fates succeed. Yet hear the issue: Since Ulysses' hand The design of the Odyssey is to shew virtue rewarded, and vice punish'd; here to introduce this act of justice with the greater solemnity, Jupiter is represented giving his assent to it: “Let there be peace (says that Deity) but let justice be done, and the guilty punished;” the Reader must necessarily be satisfy'd with the equity of the cause of Ulysses, when he hears Jupiter himself directing in it. Besides, this conduct of Homer presents us with an excellent moral; it shews us that the Deity is the governour of human affairs, and arbiter of peace and war; as he directs, the scenes of blood are open'd or clos'd, and the words of Homer, ???? ?? ????????? ?????, may be apply'd to the Odyssey as well as the Iliad. Has slain the Suitors, heav'n shall bless the land. None now the kindred of th' unjust shall own; Forgot the slaughter'd brother, and the son: Each future day to increase of wealth shall bring, And o'er the past, Oblivion stretch her wing. Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest, His people blessing, by his people blest. Let all be peace.—He said, and gave the nod That binds the Fates; the sanction of the God: And prompt to execute th' eternal will, Descended Pallas from th' Olympian hill. Now sate Ulysses at the rural feast, The rage of hunger and of thirst represt: To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent: A son of Dolius on the message went, Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld The foe approach'd, embattel'd on the field. With backward step he hastens to the bow'r, And tells the news. They arm with all their pow'r Four friends alone Ulysses' cause embrace, The Poet tells us the exact number of the party of Ulysses, which consisted of ten persons under the direction of Dolius, Laertes, and Ulysses: How many were under Eupithes is uncertain, we therefore are at liberty to suppose them more or less superior in number; Medon and Halitherses had withdrawn almost half of his assistants, and by that method reduc'd the enemy to a greater equality: it is probable that they had no very extraordinary inequality, for the onset is so sudden, that the friends of the dead Suitors could not have time to embody; besides, it appears from the sixteenth Odyssey, that of the whole band of Suitors, twelve only were Ithacans, the rest came from the adjacent Islands, and therefore none of their friends could as yet be arrived to assist Eupithes, and consequently this party consisted solely of Ithacans, and were not perhaps greatly superior to Ulysses. This observation likewise furnishes us with a reason why the enemy was so easily defeated, by so small a body of men as engaged for Ulysses. And six were all the sons of Dolius' race: Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on; And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone. Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand, And brazen Panoply invests the band. The opening gates at once their war display: Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way. That moment joins them with celestial aid, In Mentor's form, the Jove-descended maid: The suff'ring Heroe felt his patient breast Swell with new joy, and thus his son addrest. Behold, Telemachus! (nor fear the sight) The brave embattel'd; the grim front of fight! The valiant with the valiant must contend: Shame not the line whence glorious you descend, Wide o'er the world their martial fame was spread; Regard thy self, the living, and the dead. Thy eyes, great father! on this battle cast, Shall learn from me Penelope was chast. So spoke Telemachus: the gallant boy Good old Laertes heard with panting joy; And, blest! thrice blest this happy day! he cries, The day that shows me, ere I close my eyes, A son and grandson of th' Arcesian name Strive for fair Virtue, and contest for Fame! Then thus Minerva in Laertes' ear: Son of Arcesius, rev'rend warrior, hear! Jove and Jove's daughter first implore in pray'r, Then whirling high, discharge thy lance in air. She said, infusing courage with the word. Jove and Jove's daughter then the Chief implor'd, And whirling high, dismist the lance in air. Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear: Eustathius calls this an admirable incident, or change of fortune in favour of Ulysses. The son of Antinous is slain by the son of Laertes, and the father of Antinous by the father of Ulysses. We now see Ulysses happy in his wife, his son, and his father; vicctorious over his enemies, and his subjects submitting to his authority; and therefore the action is now compleat, and terminates with the Odyssey. The brass-cheek'd helmet opens to the wound; He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound. Before the father and the conqu'ring son Heaps rush on heaps; they fight, they drop, they run. Now by the sword and now the jav'lin fall The rebel race, and death had swallow'd all; But from on high the blue-ey'd Virgin cry'd, Her awful voice detain'd the headlong tyde. “Forbear ye nations! your mad hands forbear “From mutual slaughter: Peace descends to spare. Fear shook the nations. At the voice divine They drop their jav'lins, and their rage resign. All scatter'd round their glitt'ring weapons lie; Some fall to earth, and some confus'dly fly. With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour'd along, Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong. But Jove's red arm the burning thunder aims; Before Minerva shot the livid flames: Blazing they fell, and at her feet expir'd: Then stopt the Goddess, trembled, and retir'd. Descended from the Gods! Ulysses, cease; Offend not Jove: Obey, and give the peace. So Pallas spoke: The mandate from above The King obey'd. The Virgin-seed of Jove The meaning of the passage is no more than this, when stript of its poetical ornaments: Mentor, a person of great wisdom, acts as a mediator between the King and his subjects, he regulates the conditions of peace, and ratifies it with sacrifices to the Gods; this being an act of wisdom, Poetry ascribes it to Minerva. In Mentor's form, confirm'd the full accord, “And willing nations knew their lawful Lord. I must observe with what dignity Homer concludes the Odyssey: To honour his Heroe, he introduces two Deities, Jupiter and Pallas, who interest themselves in his cause: He then paints Ulysses in the boldest colours, as he rushes upon the enemy with the utmost intrepidity, and his courage is so ungovernable, that Jupiter is forc'd to restrain it with his thunder. It is usual for Orators to reserve the strongest arguments for the conclusion, that they may leave them fresh upon the Reader's memory; Homer uses the same conduct, he represents his Heroe in all his terror, he shews him to be irresistible, and by this method leaves us fully possest with a noble idea of his magnanimity. It has been already observ'd, that the End of the action of the Odyssey is the re-establishment of Ulysses in full peace and tranquillity, this is not effected, till the defeat of the Suitors' friends: and therefore if the Poet had concluded before this event, the Odyssey had been imperfect. It was necessary that the Reader should not only be inform'd of the return of Ulysses to his country, and the punishment of the Suitors, but of his re-establishment by a peaceful possession of his regal authority; which is not executed, till these last disorders rais'd by Eupithes are settled by the victory of Ulysses, and therefore this is the natural conclusion of the action. This book opens with the morning, and ends before night, so that the whole story of the Odyssey is comprehended in the compass of one and forty days. Monsieur Dacier upon Aristotle remarks, that an Epic-Poem ought not to be too long: we should be able to retain all the several parts of it at once in our memory: If we lose the idea of the beginning when we come to the conclusion, it is an argument that it is of too large an extent, and its Length destroys its Beauty. What seems to favour this decision is, that the Æneid, Iliad, and Odyssey are conformable to this rule of Aristotle, and every one of those Poems may be read in the compass of a single day. [Let vulgar souls triumphal arches raise] I have now gone through the Collections upon the Odyssey, and laid together what occurred most remarkable in this excellent Poem. I am not so vain as to think these Remarks free from faults, nor so disingenuous as not to confess them: All Writers have occasion for indulgence, and those most who least acknowledge it. I have sometimes used Madam Dacier as she has done others, in transcribing some of her Remarks without particularizing them; but indeed it was through inadvertency only that her name is sometimes omitted at the bottom of the note. If my performance has merit, either in these, or in my part of the translation (namely in the sixth, eleventh, and eighteenth books) it is but just to attribute it to the judgment and care of Mr. Pope, by whose hand every sheet was corrected. His other, and much more able assistant, was Mr. Fenton, in the fourth and the twentieth books. It was our particular request, that our several parts might not be made known to the world till the end of it: And if they have had the good fortune not to be distinguished from His, we ought to be the less vain, since the resemblance proceeds much less from our diligence and study to copy his manner, than from his own daily revisal and correction. The most experienced Painters will not wonder at this, who very well know, that no Critic can pronounce even of the pieces of Raphael or Titian, which have, or which have not, been work'd upon by those of their school? when the same Master's hand has directed the execution of the whole, reduced it to one character and colouring, gone over the several parts, and given to each their finishing. I must not conclude without declaring our mutual satisfaction in Mr. Pope's acceptance of our best endeavours, which have contributed at least to his more speedy execution of this great undertaking. If ever My name be numbered with the learned, I must ascribe it to his friendship, in transmitting it to posterity by a participation in his labours. May the sense I have of this, and other instances of that friendship, be known as long as His name will cause mine to last: And may I to this end be permitted, at the conclusion of a work which is a kind of monument of his partiality to me, to place the following lines, as an Inscription memorial of it. Let vulgar souls triumphal arches raise, Or speaking marbles to record their praise; And picture (to the voice of Fame unknown) The mimic feature on the breathing stone; Mere mortals! subject to death's total sway, Reptiles of earth, and beings of a day! 'Tis thine, on ev'ry heart to grave thy praise, A monument which Worth alone can raise: Sure to survive, when time shall whelm in dust The arch, the marble, and the mimic bust: Nor 'till the volumes of th' expanded sky Blaze in one flame, shalt thou and Homer dye: Then sink together, in the world's last fires, What heav'n created, and what heav'n inspires. If ought on earth, when once this breath is fled, With human transport touch the mighty dead: Shakespear, rejoice! his hand thy page refines; Now ev'ry scene with native brightness shines; Just to thy fame, he gives thy genuine thought; So Tully publish'd what Lucretius wrote; Prun'd by his care, thy lawrels loftier grow, And bloom afresh on thy immortal brow. Thus when thy draughts, O Raphael! time invades, And the bold figure from the canvass fades, A rival hand recalls from every part Some latent grace, and equals art with art; Transported we survey the dubious strife, While each fair image starts again to life. How long, untun'd, had Homer's sacred lyre Jarr'd grating discord, all extinct his fire? This you beheld; and taught by heav'n to sing, Call'd the loud music from the sounding string; Now wak'd from slumbers of three thousand years, Once more Achilles in dread pomp appears, Tow'rs o'er the field of death; as fierce he turns, Keen flash his arms, and all the Heroe burns; With martial stalk, and more than mortal might, He strides along, and meets the Gods in fight: Then the pale Titans, chain'd on burning floors, Start at the din that rends th' infernal shores; Tremble the tow'rs of heav'n, Earth rocks her coasts, And gloomy Pluto shakes with all his ghosts. To ev'ry theme responds thy various lay; Here rowls a torrent, there Meanders play; Sonorous as the storm thy numbers rise, Toss the wild waves, and thunder in the skies; Or softer than a yielding virgin's sigh, The gentle breezes breathe away and die. Thus, like the radiant God who sheds the day, You paint the vale, or gild the azure way; And while with ev'ry theme the verse complies, Sink without groveling, without rashness rise. Proceed, great Bard! awake th' harmonious string, Be ours all Homer! still Ulysses sing. How long Odyssey, lib. 16. that Heroe, by unskilful hands, Stript of his robes, a Beggar trod our lands? Such as he wander'd o'er his native coast, Shrunk by the wand, and all the warrior lost: O'er his smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread; Old age disgrac'd the honours of his head; Nor longer in his heavy eye-ball shin'd The glance divine, forth-beaming from the mind. But you like Pallas, ev'ry limb infold With royal robes, and bid him shine in gold; Touch'd by your hand, his manly frame improves With grace divine, and like a God he moves. Ev'n I, the meanest of the Muses train, Inflam'd by thee, attempt a nobler strain; Advent'rous waken the Mæolian lyre, Tun'd by your hand, and sing as you inspire: So arm'd by great Achilles for the fight, Patroclus conquer'd in Achilles' right: Like theirs, our Friendship! and I boast my name To thine united—For thy Friendship's Fame. This labour past, of heavenly subjects sing, While hov'ring angels listen on the wing, To hear from earth such hart-felt raptures rise, As, when they sing, suspended hold the skies: Or nobly rising in fair virtue's cause, From thy own Life transcribe th' unerring laws: Teach a bad world beneath her sway to bend; To verse like thine fierce savages attend, And men more fierce: When Orpheus tunes the lay, Ev'n fiends relenting hear their rage away.

From Helicon's imbow'ring Height repair, Attend my Labours, and reward my Pray'r. The dreadful Toils of raging Mars I write, The Springs of Contest, and the Fields of Fight; How threatning Mice advanc'd with warlike Grace, And wag'd dire Combats with the croaking Race. Not louder Tumults shook Olympus' Tow'rs, When Earth-born Giants dar'd Immortal Pow'rs. These equal Acts an equal Glory claim, And thus the Muse records the Tale of Fame. Once on a Time, fatigu'd and out of Breath, And just escap'd the stretching Claws of Death, A gentle Mouse, whom Cats pursu'd in vain, Flies swift-of-foot across the neighb'ring Plain, Hangs o'er a Brink, his eager Thirst to cool, And dips his Whiskers in the standing Pool; When near a courteous Frog advanc'd his Head, And from the Waters, hoarse-resounding said, What art thou, Stranger? What the Line you boast? What Chance hath cast thee panting on our Coast? With strictest Truth let all thy Words agree, Nor let me find a faithless Mouse in thee. If worthy Friendship, proffer'd Friendship take, And entring view the pleasurable Lake: Range o'er my Palace, in my Bounty share, And glad return from hospitable Fare. This Silver Realm extends beneath my Sway, And me, their Monarch, all its Frogs obey. Great Physignathus I, from Peleus' Race, Begot in fair Hydromeduse' Embrace, Where by the nuptial Bank that paints his Side, The swift Eridanus delights to glide. Thee too, thy Form, thy Strength, and Port proclaim, A scepter'd King; a Son of Martial Fame; Then trace thy Line, and aid my guessing Eyes. Thus ceas'd the Frog, and thus the Mouse replies. Known to the Gods, the Men, the Birds that fly Thro' wild Expanses of the midway Sky, My Name resounds; and if unknown to thee, The Soul of Great Psycarpax lives in me. Of brave Troxartes' Line, whose sleeky Down In Love compress'd Lychomile the brown. My Mother she, and Princess of the Plains Where-e'r her Father Pternotroctas reigns: Born where a Cabin lifts its airy Shed, With Figs, with Nuts, with vary'd Dainties fed. But since our Natures nought in common know, From what Foundation can a friendship grow? These curling Waters o'er thy Palace roll; But Man's high Food supports my Princely Soul. In vain the circled Loaves attempt to lie Conceal'd in Flaskets from my curious Eye, In vain the Tripe that boasts the whitest Hue, In vain the gilded Bacon shuns my View, In vain the Cheeses, Offspring of the Pale, Or honey'd Cakes, which Gods themselves regale. And as in Arts I shine, in Arms I fight, Mix'd with the bravest, and unknown to Flight. Tho' large to mine the human Form appear, Not Man himself can smite my Soul with Fear. Sly to the Bed with silent Steps I go, Attempt his Finger, or attack his Toe, And fix indented Wounds with dextrous Skill, Sleeping he feels, and only seems to feel. Yet have we Foes which direful Dangers cause, Grim Owls with Talons arm'd, and Cats with Claws, And that false Trap, the Den of silent Fate, Where Death his Ambush plants around the Bait; All dreaded these, and dreadful o'er the rest The potent Warriors of the tabby Vest, If to the Dark we fly, the Dark they trace, And rend our Heroes of the nibbling Race. But me, nor Stalks, nor watrish Herbs delight, Nor can the crimson Radish charm my Sight, The Lake-resounding Frogs selected Fare, Which not a Mouse of any Tast can bear. As thus the downy Prince his Mind exprest, His Answer thus the croaking King addrest. Thy Words luxuriant on thy Dainties rove, And, stranger, we can boast of bounteous Jove: We sport in Water, or we dance on Land, And born amphibious, Food from both command. But trust thy self where Wonders ask thy view, And safely tempt those Seas, I'll bear thee through: Ascend my Shoulders, firmly keep thy Seat, And reach my marshy Court, and feast in State. He said, and leant his Back; with nimble Bound Leaps the light Mouse, and clasps his Arms around, Then wond'ring floats, and sees with glad Survey The winding Banks dissemble Ports at Sea. But when aloft the curling Water rides, And wets with azure Wave his downy Sides, His Thoughts grow conscious of approaching Woe, His idle Tears with vain Repentance flow, His Locks he rends, his trembling Feet he rears, Thick beats his Heart with unaccustom'd Fears; He sighs, and chill'd with Danger, longs for Shore: His Tail extended forms a fruitless Oar, Half-drench'd in liquid Death his Pray'rs he spake, And thus bemoan'd him from the dreadful Lake, So pass'd Europa thro' the rapid Sea, Trembling and fainting all the vent'rous Way; With oary Feet the Bull triumphant rode, And safe in Crete depos'd his lovely Load. Ah safe at last! may thus the Frog support My trembling Limbs to reach his ample Court. As thus he sorrows, Death ambiguous grows, Lo! from the deep a Water-Hydra rose; He rolls his sanguin'd Eyes, his Bosom heaves, And darts with active Rage along the Waves. Confus'd, the Monarch sees his hissing Foe, And dives to shun the sable Fates below. Forgetful Frog! The Friend thy Shoulders bore, Unskill'd in Swimming, floats remote from Shore. He grasps with fruitless Hands to find Relief, Supinely falls, and grinds his Teeth with Grief; Plunging he sinks, and struggling mounts again, And sinks, and strives, but strives with Fate in vain. The weighty Moisture clogs his hairy Vest, And thus the Prince his dying Rage exprest. Nor thou, that flings me flound'ring from thy Back, As from hard Rocks rebounds the shatt'ring Wrack, Nor thou shalt 'scape thy Due, perfidious King! Pursu'd by Vengeance on the swiftest Wing: At Land thy Strength could never equal mine, At Sea to conquer, and by Craft, was thine. But Heav'n has Gods, and Gods have searching Eyes: Ye Mice, ye Mice, my great Avengers rise! This said, he sighing gasp'd, and gasping dy'd, His Death the young Lychopinax espy'd, As on the flow'ry Brink he pass'd the Day, Bask'd in the Beams, and loiter'd Life away: Loud shrieks the Mouse, his Shrieks the Shores repeat; The nibbling Nation learn their Heroe's Fate: Grief, dismal Grief ensues; deep Murmur sound, And shriller Fury fills the deafen'd Ground; From Lodge to Lodge the sacred Heralds run, To fix their Council with the rising Sun; Where great Troxartes crown'd in Glory reigns, And winds his length'ning Court beneath the Plains; Psycarpax Father, Father now no more! For poor Psycarpax lies remote from Shore: Supine he lies! the silent Waters stand, And no kind Billow wafts the Dead to Land! BOOK II. When rosy-finger'd Morn had ting'd the Clouds, Around their Monarch-Mouse the Nation crowds, Slow rose the Monarch, heav'd his anxious Breast, And thus, the Council fill'd with Rage, addrest. For lost Psycarpax much my Soul endures, 'Tis mine the private Grief, the publick, yours, Three warlike Sons adorn'd my nuptial Bed, Three Sons, alas, before their Father dead! Our Eldest perish'd by the rav'ning Cat, As near my Court the Prince unheedful sate. Our next, an Engine fraught with Danger drew, The Portal gap'd, the Bait was hung in View, Dire Arts assist the Trap, the Fates decoy, And Men unpitying kill'd my gallant Boy! The last, his Country's Hope, his Parent's Pride, Plung'd in the Lake by Physignathus, dy'd. Rouse all the War, my Friends! avenge the Deed, And bleed that Monarch, and his Nation bleed. His Words in ev'ry Breast inspir'd Alarms, And careful Mars supply'd their Host with Arms. In verdant Hulls despoil'd of all their Beans, The buskin'd Warriors stalk'd along the Plains, Quills aptly bound, their bracing Corselet made, Fac'd with the Plunder of a Cat they flay'd, The Lamp's round Boss affords their ample Shield, Large Shells of Nuts their cov'ring Helmet yield; And o'er the Region, with reflected Rays, Tall Groves of Needles for their Lances blaze. Dreadful in Arms the marching Mice appear: The wond'ring Frogs perceive the Tumult near, Forsake the Waters, thick'ning form a Ring, And ask, and hearken, whence the Noises spring; When near the Croud, disclos'd to publick View, The valiant Chief Embasichytros drew: The sacred Herald's Scepter grac'd his Hand, And thus his Words exprest his King's Command. Ye Frogs! the Mice with Vengeance fir'd, advance, And deckt in Armour shake the shining Lance; Their hapless Prince by Physignathus slain, Extends incumbent on the watry Plain. Then arm your Host, the doubtful Battel try; Lead forth those Frogs that have the Soul to die. The Chief retires, the Crowd the Challenge hear, And proudly-swelling, yet perplex'd appear. Much they resent, yet much their Monarch blame, Who rising, spoke to clear his tainted Fame. O Friends! I never forc'd the Mouse to Death, Nor saw the Gaspings of his latest Breath. He, vain of Youth, our Art of Swimming try'd, And vent'rous in the Lake the Wanton dy'd. To Vengeance now by false Appearance led, They point their Anger at my guiltless Head. But wage the rising War by deep Device, And turn its Fury on the crafty Mice. Your King directs the Way; my Thoughts elate With hopes of Conquest, form Designs of Fate. Where high the Banks their verdant Surface heave, And the steep Sides confine the sleeping Wave, There, near the Margin, and in Armour bright, Sustain the first impetuous Shocks of Fight: Then where the dancing Feather joins the Crest, Let each brave Frog his obvious Mouse arrest; Each strongly grasping, headlong plunge a Foe, 'Till countless Circles whirl the Lake below; Down sink the Mice in yielding Waters drown'd; Loud flash the Waters; ecchoing Shores resound: The Frogs triumphant tread the conquer'd Plain, And raise their glorious Trophies of the slain. He spake no more, his prudent Scheme imparts Redoubling Ardour to the boldest Hearts. Green was the Suit his arming Heroes chose, Around their Legs the Greaves of Mallows close, Green were the Beets about their Shoulders laid, And green the Colewort, which the Target made. Form'd of the vary'd Shells the Waters yield, Their glossy Helmets glisten'd o'er the Field; And tap'ring Sea-Reeds for the polish'd Spear, With upright Order pierc'd the ambient Air. Thus dress'd for War, they take th' appointed Height, Poize the long Arms, and urge the promis'd Fight. But now, where Jove's irradiate Spires arise, With Stars surrounded in Æthereal Skies, (A Solemn Council call'd) the brazen Gates Unbar; the Gods assume their golden Seats: The Sire superior leans, and points to show What wond'rous Combats Mortals wage below: How strong, how large, the num'rous Heroes stride; What Length of Lance they shake with warlike Pride: What eager Fire, their rapid March reveals; So the fierce Centaurs ravag'd o'er the Dales; And so confirm'd, the daring Titans rose, Heap'd Hills on Hills, and bid the Gods be Foes. This seen, the Pow'r his sacred Visage rears, He casts a pitying Smile on worldly Cares, And asks what heav'nly Guardians take the List, Or who the Mice, or who the Frogs assist? Then thus to Pallas. If my Daughter's Mind Have join'd the Mice, why stays she still behind? Drawn forth by sav'ry Steams they wind their Way, And sure Attendance round thine Altar pay, Where while the Victims gratify their Taste, They sport to please the Goddess of the Feast. Thus spake the Ruler of the spacious Skies, When thus, resolv'd, the Blue ey'd Maid replies. In vain, my Father! all their Dangers plead, To such, thy Pallas never grants her Aid. My flow'ry Wreaths they petulantly spoil, And rob my chrystal Lamps of feeding Oil. (Ills following Ills) but what afflicts me more, My Veil; that idle Race profanely tore. The Web was curious, wrought with Art divine; Relentless Wretches! all the Work was mine. Along the Loom the purple Warp I spread, Cast the light Shoot, and crost the silver Thread; In this their Teeth a thousand Breaches tear, The thousand Breaches skilful Hands repair, For which vile earthly Dunns thy Daughter grieve, And Gods, that use no Coln, have none to give. And learning's Goddess never less can owe, Neglected Learning gets no Wealth below. Nor let the Frogs to gain my Succour sue, Those clam'rous Fools have lost my favour too: For late, when all the Conflict ceast at Night, When my stretch'd Sinews work'd with eager Fight, When spent with glorious Toil, I left the Field, And sunk for slumber on my swelling Shield, Lo from the Deep, repelling sweet Repose, With noisy Croakings half the Nation rose: Devoid of Rest, with aking Brows I lay, 'Till Cocks proclaim'd the crimson Dawn of Day. Let all, like me, from either Host forbear, Nor tempt the flying Furies of the Spear. Let heav'nly Blood (or what for Blood may flow) Adorn the Conquest of a meaner Foe, Who, wildly rushing, meet the wond'rous Odds, Tho' Gods oppose, and brave the wounded Gods O'er gilded Clouds reclin'd, the Danger view, And be the Wars of Mortals Scenes for you. So mov'd the blue-ey'd Queen, her Words persuade, Great Jove assented, and the rest obey'd. BOOK III. Now Front to Front the marching Armies shine, Halt e'er they meet, and form the length'ning Line, The Chiefs conspicuous seen, and heard afar, Give the loud Sign to loose the rushing War; Their dreadful Trumpets deep mouth'd Hornets sound, The sounded Charge remurmurs o'er the Ground, Ev'n Jove proclaims a Field of Horror nigh, And rolls low Thunder thro' the troubled Sky. First to the Fight the large Hypsiboas flew; And brave Lychenor with a jav'ling slew, The luckless Warrior fill'd with gen'rous Flame, Stood foremost glitt'ring in the Post of Fame. When in his Liver struck, the Jav'lin hung, The Mouse fell thund'ring, and the Target rung; Prone to the Ground he sinks his closing Eye, And soil'd in Dust his lovely Tresses lie. A Spear at Pelion Troglodytes cast, The missive Spear within the Bosom past; Death's sable Shades the fainting Frog surround, And Life's red Tide runs ebbing from the Wound. Embasichytros felt Seutlæus' Dart Transfix, and quiver in his panting Heart; But great Artophagus aveng'd the slain, And big Seutlæus tumbling loads the Plain, And Polyphonus dies, a Frog renown'd, For boastful Speech and Turbulence of Sound; Deep thro' the Belly pierc'd, supine he lay, And breath'd his Soul against the Face of Day. The strong Lymnocharis, who view'd with Ire, A victor triumph, and a Friend expire; And fiercely flung where Troglodytes fought, With heaving Arms a rocky Fragment caught, A Warrior vers'd in Arts, of sure Retreat, Yet Arts in vain elude impending Fate; Full on his sinewy Neck the Fragment fell, And o'er his Eye-lids Clouds eternal dwell. Lychenor (second of the glorious Name) Striding advanc'd, and took no wand'ring Aim; Thro' all the Frog the shining Jav'lin flies, And near the vanquish'd Mouse the Victor dies; The dreadful Stroke Crambophagus affrights, Long bred to Banquets, less inur'd to Fights. Heedless he runs, and stumbles o'er the Steep, And wildly flound'ring flashes up the Deep; Lychenor following with a downward Blow, Reach'd in the Lake his unrecover'd Foe; Gasping he rolls, a purple Stream of Blood Distains the Surface of the Silver Flood; Thro' the wide Wound the rushing Entrails throng, And slow the breathless Carcass floats along. Lymnisius good Tyroglyphus assails, Prince of the Mice that haunt the flow'ry Vales, Lost to the milky Fares and rural Seat, He came to perish on the Bank of Fate. The dread Pternoglyphus demands the Fight, Which tender Calaminthius shuns by Flight, Drops the green Target, springing quits the Foe, Glides thro' the Lake, and safely dives below, The dire Pternophagus divides his Way Thro' breaking Ranks, and leads the dreadful Day. No nibbling Prince excell'd in Fierceness more, His Parents fed him on the savage Boar; But where his Lance the Field with Blood imbru'd, Swift as he mov'd Hydrocharis pursu'd, 'Till fall'n in Death he lies, a shatt'ring Stone Sounds on the Neck, and crushes all the Bone, His Blood pollutes the Verdure of the Plain, And from his Nostrils bursts the gushing Brain. Lycopinax with Borbocætes fights A blameless Frog, whom humbler Life delights; The fatal Jav'lin unrelenting flies, And Darkness seals the gentle Croaker's Eyes. Incens'd Prassophagus with spritely Bound, Bears Cnissodioctes off the rising Ground, Then drags him o'er the Lake depriv'd of Breath, And downward plunging, sinks his Soul to Death. But now the great Psycarpax shines afar, (Scarce he so great whose Loss provok'd the War) Swift to Revenge his fatal Jav'lin fled, And thro' the Liver struck Pelusius dead; His freckled Corps before the Victor fell, His Soul indignant sought the Shades of Hell. This saw Pelobates, and from the Flood Lifts with both Hands a monst'rous Mass of Mud, The Cloud obscene o'er all the Warrior flies, Dishonours his brown Face, and blots his Eyes. Enrag'd, and wildly sputtring, from the Shore A Stone immense of Size the Warrior bore, A Load for lab'ring Earth, whose Bulk to raise, Asks ten degen'rate Mice of modern Days. Full to the Leg arrives the crushing Wound, The Frog supportless, wriths upon the Ground. Thus flush'd, the Victor wars with matchless Force, 'Till loud Craugasides arrests his Course, Hoarse-croaking Threats precede, with fatal Speed Deep thro' the Belly runs the pointed Reed, Then strongly tug'd, return'd imbru'd with Gore, And on the Pile his reeking Entrails bore. The lame Sitophagus oppress'd with Pain, Creeps from the desp'rate Dangers of the Plain. And where the Ditches rising Weeds supply, To spread their lowly Shades beneath the Sky, There lurks the silent Mouse reliev'd of Heat, And safe imbower'd, avoids the Chance of Fate. But here Troxartes, Physignathus there, Whirl the dire Furies of the pointed Spear: Then where the Foot around its Ankle plies, Troxartes wounds, and Physignathus flies, Halts to the Pool, a safe Retreat to find, And trails a dangling Length of Leg behind, The Mouse still urges, still the Frog retires, And half in Anguish of the Flight expires; Then pious Ardor young Prassæus brings, Betwixt the Fortunes of contending Kings: Lank, harmless Frog! with Forces hardly grown. He darts the Reed in Combats not his own, Which faintly tinkling on Troxartes' Shield, Hangs at the Point, and drops upon the Field. Now nobly tow'ring o'er the rest appears A gallant Prince that far transcends his Years, Pride of his Sire, and Glory of his House, And more a Mars in Combat than a Mouse: His Action bold, robust his ample Frame, And Meridarpax his resounding Name. The Warrior singled from the fighting Crowd, Boasts the dire Honours of his Arms aloud; Then strutting near the Lake, with Looks elate, Threats all its Nations with approaching Fate. And such his Strength, the Silver Lakes around, Might roll their Waters o'er unpeopled Ground. But pow'rful Jove who shews no less his Grace To Frogs that perish, than to human Race, Felt soft Compassion rising in his Soul, And shook his sacred Head, that shook the Pole. Then thus to all the gazing Pow'rs began, The Sire of Gods, and Frogs, and Mouse, and Man. What Seas of Blood I view, what Worlds of slain, An Iliad rising from a Day's Campaign! How fierce his Jav'lin o'er the trembling Lakes The black-fur'd Heroe Meridarpax shakes! Unless some fav'ring Deity descend, Soon will the Frogs loquacious Empire end. Let dreadful Pallas wing'd with Pity fly, And make her Ægis blaze before his Eye: While Mars refulgent on his ratling Car, Arrests his raging Rival of the War. He ceas'd, reclining with attentive Head, When thus the glorious God of Combats said. Nor Pallas, Jove! tho' Pallas take the Field, With all the Terrors of her hissing Shield, Nor Mars himself, tho' Mars in Armour bright Ascend his Car, and wheel amidst the Fight; Nor these can drive the desp'rate Mouse afar, And change the Fortunes of the bleeding War. Let all go forth, all Heav'n in Arms arise, Or launch thy own red Thunder from the Skies. Such ardent Bolts as flew that wond'rous Day, When Heaps of Titans mix'd with Mountains lay, When all the Giant-Race enormous fell, And huge Enceladus was hurl'd to Hell. 'Twas thus th' Armipotent advis'd the Gods, When from his Throne the Cloud-Compeller nods, Deep length'ning Thunders run from Pole to Pole, Olympus trembles as the Thunders roll. Then swift he whirls the brandish'd Bolt around, And headlong darts it at the distant Ground, The Bolt discharg'd inwrap'd with Light'ning flies, And rends its flaming Passage thro' the Skies, Then Earth's Inhabitants the Niblers shake, And Frogs, the Dwellers in the Waters, quake. Yet still the Mice advance their dread Design, And the last Danger threats the croaking Line, 'Till Jove that inly mourn'd the Loss they bore, With strange Assistants fill'd the frighted Shore. Pour'd from the neighb'ring Strand, deform'd to View, They march, a sudden unexpected Crew, Strong Suits of Armor round their Bodies close, Which, like thick Anvils, blunt the Force of Blows; In wheeling Marches turn'd oblique they go, With harpy Claws their Limbs divide below, Fell Sheers the Passage to their Mouth command, From out the Flesh the Bones by Nature stand, Broad spread their Backs, their shining Shoulders rise, Unnumber'd Joints distort their lengthen'd Thighs, With nervous Cords their Hands are firmly brac'd, Their round black Eye-balls in their Bosom plac'd, On eight long Feet the wond'rous Warriors tread, And either End alike supplies a Head. These, mortal Wits to call the Crabs, agree; The Gods have other Names for Things than we. Now where the Jointures from their Loins depend, The Heroes Tails with sev'ring Grasps they rend. Here, short of Feet, depriv'd the Pow'r to fly, There without Hands upon the Field they lie. Wrench'd from their Holds, and scatter'd all around, The bended Lances heap the cumber'd Ground. Helpless Amazement, Fear pursuing Fear, And mad Confusion thro' their Host appear, O'er the wild Wast with headlong Flight they go, Or creep conceal'd in vaulted Holes below. But down Olympus to the Western Seas, Far-shooting Phœbus drove with fainter Rays, And a whole War (so Jove ordain'd) begun, Was fought, and ceas'd, in one revolving Sun.</field>
