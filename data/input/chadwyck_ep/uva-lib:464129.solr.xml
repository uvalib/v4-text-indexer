      <field name="fulltext">A CURE FOR THE Tongue-Evill. Reader take well what I thee here present To Cure thy Tongue, that wild-fire instrument, As it by Common Oaths doth give offence To all that fear God in a filial sence. Now what means swearing customarily? Is't not a strain of hellish poesy? But stay; who ever heard hells Jailor use With horrid oath Gods dreadfull name t'abuse? Cert's 'tis a truth, to give devills their due, They will not swear, as doth their cursed crue. The devils roaring herd both swear and lye, But this alone is his grand property? Hells fiend rants not in wine, or ale, or beer As if with oaths he heaven and earth would tear. His subtile wit variety affords Without all nonsense-sauring swearing-words. Yet as for oaths, as commonly they're us'd The Causes of vein swearing. The causes vile, by which they are produc't, Are hells provoking pow'rs, Satan and sin, St. Matth. 5. 27. Sinne unrepented causing rage within; Want of Gods fear and love, the great neglect Esay 57. 20.] Of daily prayers, want of due respect To Gods all-seeing eye, his vast essence, That heaven and earth doth fill with his presence; Neglect of reading Gods most Holy Law, Which God hath made to keep us in his awe, The damn'd abuse of meat to great excesse, Of Wine, and other drinks, to drunkennesse, A vayn and light heart, a distemper'd brain, And fellowship with those, whom Oathes do stain, ?Anger? and heedless minde, base idlenesse, Anger, and gaming, and covetousnesse For were it not for these infectious ills, No speech would bee, that conversation spills. A mad Sin.Swearing's a bodge in wilde mens poetry, Who minde not words of ingenuity. It is a rash fooles bolt, that is soon shot, Did men consider, use it they would not. It is the rant of debauch'd Ruffians, That stare and roar o're pots and cups and cans. It is a mad, uncivill, Bedlam course, Which gracelesse people use in their discourse. It is the silth defiles Gods Attributes, A Folly which with reason never suites. The Cognizance 'tis of Gods Enemy, Hellish. St. Matth. 5. 27. Lam. 5. 12.The damned mens note in Hellish misery. It is from Hell a vapour rising so, That down to Hell again it bends to goe. It is a badge of Satans followers, Gives blackness worse than that of Colliers. It binds the Soul to Satan, Death and Hell. It is the signe, at which Satan doth dwell. Devillish. Psal. 10. 7.It is the Common and filthy drivell Of a foul in-mate in men, the Devill. Filthy,It is the poyson of the lips, which makes The soul to stink worse than the filthiest lakes. Terrible.It is the thunder from Hell that is sent, For it men quake, if for it they repent. It is a banefull hearb, that grows apace. Banefull. It chokes the seed of the good word of grace. It is the Common Filth, whereby's defil'd Common. Both Man and Woman, and the tender Child. One onely day the Sabbath men do break But every day and hour sweare, when they speak. Oaths are so common, they fly up and down In every Country, County, City, Town. At Cards and Dice, at table, bed and boord Men use this plaguy soul polluting word. Both Master and Servants in every place Gods Holy Name do commonly disgrace: The rich and poor in this are all alike, At Gods great name with ugly Oaths they strike. There's scarce an house, in which there's not one dead Through wicked oaths, which wound the heart and head. For other sies there seemeth some pretence, That profit or pleasure doth flow from thence; Unprofitable, Such is the way of Drunkards, theevish wights, And those that violate the Nuptiall Rites; But swearing is so base a foolery, It brings no pleasure, nor utility. It wounds more hearts together at one blow, Injurious, Then any weapon of the deadly'st foe. A Common oath is like a fatal dart, To a mans self. Psal. 109. 19. Zach. 5. 3. Psal. 109. 17, 18, 19. Which being shot doth wound the shooters heart. An house full of plagues and a tongue of Oaths Are joyn'd together, as Body and Cloaths. For this the flying roll of cursed woe That cuts off many, o're the earth doth go. As man doth not delight to blesse, but swear His body and Goods. And curse, so shall he wofull curses wear. This brings the plague of mens houses of clay, Upon their goods and Chattels in a way. Of crosses losses and many curses It breeds a vacuum in mens purses. Nothing holds well with those, who do'nt refrain, Their tongues from belching in this bloody strain. The swearer needs no executioner, But his vile tongue himself to rent and tear, To his Soul, Psal. 64. 8.He needs not any poison, spear or sword, To kill himself, but his own tongue and word. To his good name.A good name is precious in ev'ry kinde, But this is worthless in a swearers minde. It is a truth, 'gainst which there's no dispute, He lyar-like is crackt in his repute. To Saints,By oaths Saints hearts are wounded through their ears They'r words for which the Christian sheddeth tears; They grieve Gods Spirit in saints, and they make In little worlds a great and sad earth-quake. Swearing is like the plague it spreads and kills, To others.With great infection it many fills. The swearers by their plagues company, Still multiply their base society. To the King.Except the Scottish Covenant-sharer, I dare pronounce the rash common swearer, The worst of the worst of Subjects, yea more The millions of common oathes men swore, Occasion'd this damned Covenant, As being the product of the swearers rant: God suffer'd this for these, for cause best known Unto his dreadfull Majesty alone. To gather rebells 'gainst our Sovereign Our Church and State, to our great woe and pain. To Kingdoms.Swearing's a fire, that many places burns, It is an engine, houses over-turns, It smites the aire into tempests, thunder, The ground Gods-footstool it tears asunder. It makes the Land to put on sable weeds, Ier. 23. 10. And in great Kingdoms dismal changes breeds. This bloody agent both in Church and State, Hosea 4. 3. Doth ruin all things in most dreadfull fate. It is a Kingdom-weakning, wasting Sin, It is a State-confounding cursed gin, This leading generall sin in notions, Doth bring upon them desolations. This sin which is of a deep stain and die, On all the world brings grievous misery. Tis sad to think how many Millions Do damn their souls by their foul swearing tongues, Tis sad to think, how many plagues and woes Are usher'd in by Oathes, mens mortal foes. Swearing's high treason 'gainst the King of Kings, To God. On swearers heads who justly Vengeance brings, Gods attributes stand all engag'd, 'gainst all That commonly to witnesse God doth call. A swearer is Gods daring Opposite, Psal. 129. 20. And is abhominable in his sight, As much as in man lies, he wounds Gods soul, As if vain dust would live without controul: No man Gods honour makes to suffer worse, Gods honour. Than one, for trifles that doth swear and curse. The Swearers life Gods greatness doth defie, And his Omniscience doth vilifie, Gods name with such is common and unclean, A mark they doe to Satans service lean. They God Almighties Majesty forsake, And creatures frail All-judging Gods doe make, Law. Giving them part of Worship that's divine, Against Gods Law, from which they do decline, They are the Rabshakehs that blaspheme God, Ier. 5. 7. They clip his mercie and quicken his rod Of dreadfull justice; many of them have Person.Lost both their lives and souls, while they did grave. Psal. 73. 9.They strike at Heaven, yea Deity it self; And this they do for any trifling pelfe. They slight Gods justice, as if Mercy was Justice.The only Attribute of Divine grace. They to their power out brave the Lord above, For his great Name have no respect, nor love. They make the Lord to patronize a lie, Yea all the filth of vile iniquity, To want an all-discerning, judging eye, Or else to be a drowsie Deity. They spit their venome in Jehovahs face, The Lords great Majesty they doe disgrace. They mock Gods roaring, thundring voyce and note, Christs Church, Person, Name, Bloud, Body.They rent a-sunder Christ his seamlesse coat. There is but one most precious saving name, The name of Jesus of transcendent same, And yet these Swearers most unthankfully, Abuse this name of names most filthily. They make no more esteem of Christ his bloud, Than of dumb beasts unclean, that doth no good. Oathes are the nayls that pierce Christs hands &amp; feet, They are the thorns that crown'd his head most sweet They are the speare that wound his blessed fide, In's bloody sweat they caus'd him to abide God wrongs them not, yea what they are and have, They have of God, yet his Name they deprave. A Sin most sinull.Gods person they contemne most gracelesly, And his Precepts and that most publikely: And this is it, their sin that aggravates. Above all other that Jehovah hates. They are the worst of sinners wronging God, Provoking him with his most dreadfull Rod. To punish Rulers, Kingdoms, Church and State, With Sword and Pestilence unfortunate, Famine and Plagues of all-sorts, that may be Wholly destructive to Felicity. A man that stares and swears blasphemously, Becomes brim-full of vile iniquity: Shew me a swearer, and I'le shew to thee Psal. 59. 12. A lyer, shew to me one that doth lye, And I'le shew thee a theif, one in whom lies Zac 8. 17. A base deformed heap of perjuries. Psal. 10. 7. Swearing is no single evil, there's none A complicated Evil. That ever us'd it, that us'd it alone; It argues hearts profane, and loose, and vile; Hos. 4. 2. All parts in man it sadly doth defile. By faith men swear, and so turn Infidells, They swear by truth, till no truth in them dwells; As they are honest men they swear, and so To all the points of Knavery they go. They vainly swear by their Salvations hope, So yeild their necks to the tormentors rope: They swear by Creatures, which they drink and eat, Provoking God to curse their drink, their meat; At table while they swear without controul, Their table's made a snare to catch their soul. Psal. 69. 22. Oh that vile man, who is dust and ashes, Did see the stabs, wounds, and bloody gashes Made in his soul by Oaths, that he might shun This excrement in Conversation! Oh that vain swearers saw the work they make, When they Gods blessed Name in vain do take; Yea when they tear the Lords most holy Name, Without all fear and wit, all grace and shame. Oh that they saw Gods wrath in dreadfull might, Threatning revenge to ev'ry banning wight; For then they would not, could not, dare not swear, But they would speak of God in holy fear; Yea they would be for ever rather still, Then they would croak against their Makers will. Cast off therefore this poyson of the tongue, With all the filth, that to it doth belong; Cast out this Devil, least it cast thee down Into the pit of Condemnation. Let no God-dammees from thy mouth proceed, Least with damn'd Spirits thou be numbered. Ob.Say not, thou canst not help this swearing strain, Sol.Help but thy self, Gods help thou shalt obtain. 1.Now that thou may'st this Black-mouth Devil shun, Remedies against rash swearing.Joyn Fasting to thy Supplication; With an Oath loathing heart thy Oaths confesse, Make clean thy heart, this evil to suppresse. As with a Bit thy mouth and lips fast keep, Whilst for thy Oaths thou heartily dost weep. Strive against all thy hearts corruptions, That grace may deck all thy expressions; 2.Fear God, and mind his power thee to smite By sudden death into Hells fearfull night; Hold in thy hand the rugged staff of Hell, That thou may'st use thy tongue in all things well. 2 Chr. 24. 2.King Joash prosper'd whiles Jehojada Did Counsel him to keep Gods Holy Law: So whiles Gods fear doth rule the heart of man, His speech doth thrive in praises Christian. Acquaint thy self with the Lords sacred Laws, That thou may'st not take Oaths without a cause; See there his Oath forbidding, threatning power Against blasphemous wretches ev'ry hour: Stamp on thy heart Gods awfull Majesty, For then thy lips will shun all blasphemy. Thus was Saint Austin cured, who before He feared God, did swear as many more; He read Gods word and feared, and this fear Would not permit him any more to swear. Of God thy Lord think rightly all thy dayes, 3. But do not use his Name, but to his Praise, Use not thy self Gods Holy Name to use, Least thou by Oaths Gods Holy Name abuse: Psal. 35. 28. Swear not, unlesse Gods Honour to defend, Eccles. 23. 10. 11. and an Oath. Swear not, unlesse to strifes to put an end, Unlesse thy Name, Goods, Body, Life to save From great Reproaches, Losses, Crosses, Grave: Swear not, unlesse in Justice, Judgement, Truth, Jer. 4. 2. Let these be joyn'd in ev'ry taken Oath: Swear not thy self or any man to wrong, Swear not to shew the rashnesse of thy tongue, Swear not to fence or underprop a lie, For this contracts the guilt of perjury. Wouldst thou not Gods most Holy Name profane? 4. Observe Gods dayes most Holy, without blame. Remember this, remember Holynesse, In reference to all Righteousnesse. Keep like a Christian Christs Sabbath day, That on the week dayes thou may'st keep alway Thy lips from speaking vile blasphemous words, The language which the scalding lake affords. Mind Polycarpus, choosing death by fire, 5. Rather than swear by Cæsars love or ire; This gracious thought in his good soul did dwell, To chuse sins way is the sure way to Hell. Rebuke these words of death in all, and cry, 6. Why do you smite my God, my King on high? 'Tis just with God, men swear themselves to death, When they forbear to check the swearers breath. 7.Mind this of Oaths, how great indignity, And what disgrace thou casts on God thereby. What if thy Prince did make a Law, that all That vainly swear, this evil should befall, That they should suffer seared lips, or tongues, Bored quite through with burning hot Irons, Or hang'd, beheaded, drown'd, or burnt should be, And should loose all the worlds prosperity? Wouldst thou not Cov'nant with thy lips &amp; tongue To use Gods Name with circumspection? I dare presume thou wouldst, yet wilt thou not Fear God, who threatens swearers with the lot Of endlesse, easelesse torments in Hell-fire, Which none, but he, can do in his fierce ire? Methinks thou shouldst consider well in mind, That God's thy Maker, and Preserver kind, That God is Lord and Judge of all, for hence Thou mightest learn Gods Name to reverence, And alwayes stand in greater awe of God, Than man, who can scourge all men with his Rod. 8.Consider that the Hosts Cælestiall, The Sun, and Moon, and Stars, obey Gods call: Consider that the Heavens, the Clouds, the Aire, Fire, Earth, and Sea, and all things therein are, Bespeak us all by their obedience, Gods Holy Name to have in reverence: Consider that all things both deaf and dumb, Do call on us Gods Servants to become; And b'ing endow'd with reasons light, and grace, To praise Gods sacred Name in ev'ry place. 9.Consider this, that God for all he gives, Asks only prayse, while mortall mankind lives, That hon'ring God in this sad vale of tears, They may him praise in Heav'n, free from all fears. Keep silence or refrain thy lips some dayes 10 From Oaths, yea words, to free thy mouth alwayes From uselesse fruitlesse speech; for then thou shalt So keep thy tongue, that it shall never halt. Resolve for each rash Oath this penalty 11 To put upon thy self in equity, Give certain silver peeces to the Poor, As two or three or four or six or more: For by their prayers great in Gods esteeme, Thou may'st thy mouth from all vain Oaths redeem. Mind praysing God, as they in Heav'n that dwell, 12 Angells and Saints, for in it they excell. And if with them thou thinkest a part to bear, Thou must on Earth betimes desist to swear. Gods Saints below foresee Gods love above, And this their hearts &amp; tongues doth strongly move To praise his holy name, while they do live, That God to them eternall life may give. They are not like proud wordlings, who like Swine Tread under feet the gifts, that are divine, Through all the gifts they do receive, they see And do acknowledg God most thankfully. They wait for life in Heav'n free from all shame, And therefore here they praise Gods holy name. Mind if thy name men used commonly, 13 As thou dost use Gods dreadfull Majesty, Thou would'st it take in great and just disdain, As if thy name they filthily did stain. And do not thou to others, what thou wouldest hate. Others should do to thee in name, or state. That thou mayest not thy soul in danger bring, 14 Through Oaths pull out thy raging passions sting; Let not the worlds great make-bate anger make Col. 3. 8. Thee madman-like Gods holy name to take. Psalm 37. 8. Look how unruly dogs their chains that slip, To do great Mischiefs up and down will skip: So wrathfull men for want of reasons pow'r Hos. 4. 11. Gods honour seek most wildly to devour. Now that thou may'st shun wrath, where Oaths do low, Remedys against Wrath.Indang'ring soules (as Wisemen clearly know) Praise God if once his blessed hand of grace 1.Restrain'd thy tongue from speaking in disgrace Of his great Majesty, that thou may'st still Find grace to speak according to his will. Behold Christ Jesus, his sad agony And bloody sweat enduring quietly, 2.Behold him suff'ring most cruell scoffings, Spittings, whippings and wofull buffetings, And last of all a death of pain and shame For thee, that wrath may never thee in flame. Mind this (vile worm) that thus Christ suffered That thou by wrath may'st never be misled. 3.Keep anger in by silence, that it may Psal. 39. 2.Soon spend it self and vanish quite away 4.With Heathenish Cato learn to pardon all Except thy self for failings great and small. 15.To keep thy tongue from oaths those words of death Remedies against swearing.Take heed of drunkennesse whilst thou dost breath. That heart-bewitching, brain-besotting sin, Marring speech without, spoyling heart within. Hos. 4. 11.Hence oaths men use when drunk, stick in their teeth When sober grown, and this the Wise man seeth. 16.If thou dost love thy soul next God most dear, Of Wrathfull men, as common swearers are, Avoyd the banning company; for why? Prov. 22. 24.It bindes, betrays, and blindes destructively. Forbear their presence, or do not forbear To give them due rebukes, when they do swear, And that with friendly, loving gentlenesse, That they their Oaths with loathing may confesse, That this Goliah monstrous sin may have 17. Its wound to death, I do thee humbly crave, That thou wouldst pruden warning take, This sin of sins most timely to forsake, By dreadfull Judgements on Blasphemere sent, That for and from vain Oaths thou may'st repent. See stories stuft with Swearers smitten dumb, So struck, that mad, blind, dead they did become. And those examples were, that men might fear God and themselves by Oaths to rent and tear. Let Kings therefore be wise, and Magistrates, So ord'ring all that live within their Gates, That none do swear by Gods most sacred Name, Least they themselves do suffer for the same Shame and dishonour, for Gods word is true, 1 Sam. 2. 30. Dishonour me, and I'le dishonour you. Let all be wise, and utter not a word That may become their soul-destroying sword. Let all with all their might advance Gods Name, That God may keep them from eternal shame. Let all our tongues speak well of God most high, That God may bless us all Eternally. Let us all pray, and do accordingly, 1 Pet. 3. 15. With hearts and tongues, that we may sanctifie Gods holy, dreadfull, just, and mighty Name, Matth. 6. That all our speeches may be free from blame; So shall we use our tongues with sapience, And shall be blessed, when we go from hence. Let us not say, our words are winde, for why? Ob. This is a truth, which wise men can't deny; Sol. Rash Oaths are such a winde, that hurry men Into the Devils black and noysome Den. Ob.Let us not call our Oaths to speech a grace, Sol.For that by them Gods Name we do deface. Lastly, if we will bear most worthily, The name of Children dear to God on high, If we do love our God in Heaven, our King, Our Goods, our Soul as a most precious thing, Our Kin, our Country-men, and Nation, Angels and Saints, and our Salvation: Let us not curse or swear as Atheists do, That ban themselves to Hell, the lake of woe. Let us be still, or let our speech bring forth Something, to some that may be something worth. Let our words be few, wise, and circumspect, And alwayes to Gods glory have respect, Psal. 145. 2.That speaking here like Angels, as we ought, Hereafter we to Angels may be brought. ???? ???
