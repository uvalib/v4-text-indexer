      <field name="fulltext">[How soon are wicked men cut of] Quam cito de viuis extirpabuntur iniqui? Fidentum domino pars bona fortis erit: Per breue t?pus adhuc et non erit impi? vltra Quæretur, nec erit quo fuit ante loco. How soon are wicked men cut of, from suche as liue in fame? Yet is the Lord the portion good, of those that loue his name. A little while as yet therfore, and there shall not remain: One wicked man hence foorth to be, of all the wicked train. The wicked man shall then be sought, but he shall not finde grace: There to be found where he before, was knowne to haue a place. And therfore ioy all Englishe hart? that fear the Lord aright And haue the loue of natiue land, alwayes before your sight. Lift vp your hart?, reioyce in him, for woork of his owne hand: For I of happy tidings mean, to let you vnderstand. Whiche cheerful wishe sure to all, of faithful Englishe blood: Whose hart? did neuer hate the truthe, nor Gospel yet withstood. A man there was a quondam great of might, of pomp and praise: Of Englishe blood though Englishe loue, were small in all his wayes. As did appeer by Roomishe act?, proceeding from his hight: Which proou'de him not an Englishman but sure a Romain right. For neuer faithful Englishe hart, was foe to natiue soil: Yet hee in natiue land did seek, Christ? faithful flock to spoil. And also then he wrought muche wo, to Englands cheefest stayes: He spilt their blood, and mockt Gods woord wherby his gaue him praise. Seducing men from sacred truthe, to walke in Roomishe trade: Wherby this land was ransackt so, so spoild and so bare made. That many yet doo feel the smart, of that vnhappy time: Though God haue cl?sed now these part? from suche moste vgly crime. Wherwith this land infected was, by Balams brood throughout: Who sought a mischeef huge and great, as then to bring about. And more then so, t'encreace by blood the great and pining lack: Of pastors pure and pillers strong, whiche then were brought to wrack. Without remorse his mates and he, ful sore did them torment: By seeking of their death and losse, whiche lou'd Christ? testament. And more then so, of woorthy wight? of whom bereft are wee: Whiche left their welth, their ease &amp; life, that Christe might gayned bee. And yet not so, this Cyrus left muche humain blood to spil: And so ceace his deuouring rage, and moste blasphemous wil. But more and more he sought outrage, (as all his mates were bent) By lies and tales and popishe toyes, Gods gospel to preuent. As one in place by Sathan sent, Gods instrument of ire. To daunt the pride of England then, (whiche did it muche require) And so no dout this Boner did, he spared no degree: Ne wise, ne graue, ne riche, ne poor, he pitied no man hee. Ne lame, ne blinde, suche was his thirst ne fooles, ne wise in name: Yea nobles blood as tirant tride, he sought to bring to flame. When pastors roum &amp; Bishops place, of London See he had: As beautie then of all his dayes, (a Woolf in Lamb skinne clad) His rage defilde the seat with crime, that nations far could say: A drunken man dooth take in hand, to guide the ship her way. Not drunk w? wine tho iudgement might, declare he loou'd it more: Then Christes pasture sheep wherby, he should haue set great store. But bloody drunk sith hee not one, did spare of Christes sheep: Whiche did desire their conscience pure, by Gospel for to keep. Yet he did watche, though as a Woolf, Christ? lambs for to deuoure: He watched not to feed their soules, nor yet to preache one houre. For sure though he had Bishops rowm, Paul saith he was vnfit. In suche a place of Christes flock, at any time to sit. Whose iudgement was so small &amp; weak, in Christes testament: And learning lesse to teache the flock, with that so slowe intent. Should he obtain of grace deuine, now for to haue a praise? Whose retcheles rage and swinishe life, shall liue in all mens dayes. His knoweledge was to base no dout, to sit in Bishops seat: Though he perhaps in Popes decrees, through trauail might be great. And Ciuile law right prompt he knew, though all for priuate gain: And Cannons to, for therin was his onely studeous pain. And all but to vpholde the pride, of Rome whiche was to il: Or els to finde away how he, Gods childrens blood might spil. But who can boste in Gods decrees, of Bonners knoweledge now? In Scriptures force his answers shewd him learned as a Cow. Or as an Asse whiche iudgement lacks, in sence of holy writ: Though he obtaind a bitter space, in Bishops seat to sit. Sus taught Mineruam there to long, whiche held vsurped place: Til Christe by force of Gospel truthe, this Bufo did displace. And took the Asse from his repast, of playing on the harp: Whose horned pawes in harmony, made neither flat nor sharp. But spilt the sound so long a time, when mischeef reignd at wil: Til Pallas came, who took the Asse down from Parnassus hil. And tied him vp at maunger yet, whiche once did there remain: Though there he felt not his desert? nor halfe deserued pain. To lodge on boords as he had made, some other lodge before: With hands and feet, to starue in stocks, with giues to be ful sore. No, no, in stall, his torment? were none suche nor half so vile: He pris'ner hath been sure, but yet not tasted all this while. Of pris'ners thrall, of hungers bit, in dungeon deep to grone: Yet he of rapture's life ful oft, to many made his mone. Not sure for pain whiche he did feel but for the greatest greef: That he could not be fed as yet, (in slaughter who was cheef) With blood of Saint? and christian fleshe, wherwith his lust was fed: That he could not exalt the Pope, stil heer as supreme hed. That he could not his holy Lambes, and leaden Bulles bestowe: His Pardons and his obsequies, mens soules to ouerthrowe. That truthe had ouerthrowen w? power his brutishe vile intent: Whiche thought by fire &amp; fagots force, Gods Gospel to preuent. This wrought his onely greef and wo, as wel it did appeer: For other cause sure there was none, that euer I could hear. He lay ful soft and had inough of Beer, and chaunge of wine: Bothe fleshe and fishe, bothe fruit? &amp; foul, moste delicate and fine. His table neuer wanted sutes, at wil it to maintain: He lacked neuer cators he, his ayds took alwayes pain. To keep their God, their hope, their trust, their staffe of Roomishe stay: Because with him they wisht a chaunge, stil looking for a day. And not with him but with the rest, of all their hellishe rable: Whiche are in their blinde errors stil, moste hard and wilful stable. Who pris'ners are as foes to Christe, to Christian Queen and land: But cheef this quondam which made boste if he might haue in hand. His former poure and time again, to blesse and curse at wil: Where one he burnt, on thousands then he would his lust fulfil. This was his boste and blooddy thirst, wherin his ayds did trust: That once again the Roomishe whore, might haue her filthy lust. Although since he by due desert, hath been in holde for sin: Suche mercy hath been shew'd him there, as he shew'd none I win. To suche as were his betters far, in knoweledge, birth and fame: Yea and in life Apostolique, of muche more godly name. For sure his manners were moste vile, at all times plainly shew'd: Why? wa'st not he that sought the tree, of our increace t'aue hew'd? Who shamelesly hath stand thus long, at royall mercyes grace: Although his deeds and woords ful oft, did craue another place. But what said those of Balams sect, there is no law wherby: The swoord of Iustice could him strike, nor cause why he should die. Although when as the Dragon rulde, right woorthy wight? were slain: But one when cannon law could not, he was adiudged pain. Without the Cannons councels he, that Pool might haue his place: By Popes assent and Roomishe rout, whiche ror'd him to deface. Yf Popes assent when Englishe lawes, nor Cannons cuold preuail: Might giltles make so wise a sage, by fiery flames to quail. Why might not Princes lawful power haue made a iust decree? That suche, deseruing open shame, might recompensed be. But onely that pure mercy did, keep back that right did craue: In recompensing him with death, as all the rest might haue. Yet he tryumpht as whole and sound, his purpose whole to make: Right many yet (if time would serue) to bring vnto the stake. And once again if fortune stood, he might haue vp the Masse: (But see how now the Lord of hostes hath made his foe like grasse) Who bragd and boasted in his greace, to washe the tile anew: And faind an end to his deuise, whiche yet he neuer knew. And so the rest with cheerful sound, at eu'ry newes that came: Sang as the Prouerb olde hath been Laudes ante victoriam. Sith monst'rous corps with delicates, so monst'rously was blowen: Whose monst'rous minde w? poys'ning woords in graue is ouerthrowen But what? did he repent of all his blooddy sinful race? And learn by Gods woord to amend, his life so voyd of grace? Nay sure, til time of present death he chaunged not his minde: But as he liu'd a foe to Christe, so dyed moste wilful blinde. Oh yet though he had liu'd so il, Gods mercy is not bace: To suche as think that Ihesus Christe, can all their sinnes deface. But as this Eresichthon liu'd, in spite and rage to spoil: So in his end of mightie Ioue, he took a deadly foil. Not that he died, but that in death his helth he did denie: For sure non mori turpéest, sed turpiter mori. And yet though Eresichthons end, hapt not vnto this foe: To eat his fleshe sith Boners mates, in stie did fat him so. Yet viler end had he no dout, Then Eresichthons was: Because their times were far vnlike, as it did come to passe. The one a Christian was in name the other Pagan prowd: Yet in there acts of maners like, as may bee wel avowd. Hee, Ceres sought, this Ihesus Christe, and his to bring to wrack: He did starue, this with grease died, though grace from him went back. Wherby all suche as blinded were, by fau'ring of his act? May see what iudgement is preparde, to recompence their fact?. And therfore houle all Balams seed, and weep bothe moste and least: Whiche bear the mark (in suche a light) of that il fau'red beast. But Englishe hart? whiche loue Gods word our Queen &amp; Englishe land: Reioyce, sith hope of foes is spoild by force of Gods right hand. Sith filthy fleshe dooth lie in graue, though soule I fear be il: Whiche liu'd and died so stout a foe to Christes death and wil. But what though blooddy corps of his be forste to lie ful lowe: His blooddy fact? and deeds moste vile, from hence shall no man knowe? Shall treason so conspir'd: shall pride? shall blasphemy lie dead? No fame from earth to vpper skies, his wickednes shall spread. His brutishe tigrishe toil in time, of his moste high renown: T'extoll the power and pomp of him, that weres the triple crown. His rage and currishe cruel spite, against his cuntrie men: His butcherly deuice to waste, the fleshe of Christians then. His false surmise and murdring spite, whiche shew'd him then to be: A Poliphemus right, whiche flue, in three yeeres hundreds three. Not of Vlisses souldiours sure, but Christians truly tride: Whiche were deuoured while he had the Ruther for to guide. Shall now Philonides lie dead? shall Serpentinishe rage So sleep? Nay sure his wickednes, shall liue the worldes age. His stoutnes shall remain now shewd, in time of his conflict: Who as a subiect did deny, to haue his hart adict. And as a foe to Christe (his woord) and to our gratious Queen: Wisht with his mates moste trat'rosluy some others raign I ween. Beside his Epicurishe life, before and in this cace: Though corps be dead yet death cannot, these horrours quite deface: He suffred was ful ten yeers space, by fauour him to win: (As Gospels nature is) yet he, could neuer once begin. For to repent (though fauour he, deserued had but small: At those, whiche now in his distresse, did shew him moste of all.) But scoft and mocked those, as yet whiche gladly would him teache: But cheefly in his death, suche men as Gospel soundly preache. And therfore sith in life of his, no vertue was to praise: In welth ne wo no spark of grace, whiche liu'd and spent his dayes. So like a Cyclops in his den, deseruing no good fame: Sith God hath cut of suche a Drone can we but praise his name? And eke beseeche th'almightie Ioue, the number to fulfil: In cutting of the rest with speed, that bear the beast good wil. Who sure may shame at his vile race, but more at his vile end: And sore lament his fearful state, whiche now did not amend. Though all his life he had been bent, yet now to stand so stout: Denying Christe at his last breath, Is fearful out of dout. This may suffize as God hath lent, me grace to rule my pen: In blasing foorth the deeds and fame, (before all Christian men) Of Romaines greasy God, whose life and death (so woorthy shame:) I haue display'd, and therfore now, suche shalbe muche to blame. Which carp at truthe and stomack this that eury man can tel: Through out this land and others to, ere this, whiche knew it wel. God saue our Queen Elizabeth, and bring her foes to il: And root out those with speed from vs whiche bear the Pope good wil. Amen. ? T. Knell. Iu. A Commemoration or Dirige of Bastarde Edmonde Boner, alias Sauage, vsurped Bisshoppe of London. Episcopatum eius accipiet alter. [My soule haue cleaued fast to the grounde] Boner speaketh. My soule haue cleaued fast to the grounde, I haue fed like a swine, and liued like a ho?de My thought it did me muche good, In broilyng the christians, and shedyng blood I haue shewed my waies, I haue shewed my waies How well I loued the Romishe kaies The reliques of Rome were my delight, I was a maiden priest, and our ladies knight. Iustification I could not abide, Specially if it came on Christes side: I will clime heauen walles with Scala cœli, And followe Alkoc, quondam bishop of Elie. My soule now slepe, in dreames and greues My corps is buried emong false theues: For my bodie and soule, th'apointed place, Abusyng mercie, and refusyng grace. The waie of wickednes, I loued well, In missyng of Purgatorie, perhaps to hell: I beshrowe Dorbell, and Dunses harte, Would I had been no bishop, but gon to carte. The waie of truthe, I did once take, Whiche of malice, I did forsake: And neuer since I did repente, In despisyng the eternall testamente. I did sticke ones vnto Goddes lawes, But to forsake it, I had no cause: And hardned my harte, &amp; stopped mine eares And could not wepe repentant teares. The waie of thy c?maundm?t I might not bide After that I was drunke with y? cup of pride, But waxed lothly, foule, and fatte, Like to cardinall Wolsey, with his red hatte. Boner ende. Deus stetit in Synagoga deorum. His lordship would plaie the Iustice of Corum In the place of iudgement, it did hym good, To accuse the martyres, and shed their blood. O Clemens. There is no man within the citie, Professyng Christes Gospell, that he would pitie Muche mischief this verlet, did begin Therefore his praier is tourned to synne. O Pia. He had a cancred proude looke, With bell and candell, and Popishe booke: In cursyng Gods people with hellishe grace, Awaie graundpanche, with thy greasie face. O Crux. Now a peece of your Dirige I will begin, I care not whether, I lose or winne: You were no greate state of honor, A bastarde, no bishop, but bloudie Boner. Mournyng in blacke, wailyng with care and woo, Wryngyng of their handes, thei began with Placebo. Dilexi ? master Papist, I loued well Boner, That was boshoppe of London, and liued in greate honor. Quia inclinauit aurem suam, to our good father the Pope, Iam iacit ille cinis, alas gone is our hope. Circumdederunt eum dolores mortis, now rotten in graue, Well, well, said the protest?t, well rid of a.k. Perhaps c? pericula inferni with Chymerus fell, Or Cerborus the triple hedded dogge of hell. Tribulationem &amp; dolorem inuenit, that bastarde theefe. That haue spoiled Christes flocke, with spite and greefe. O domine libera animam meam, from this Basan Bull, That the innocent lambes did teare and pull. Custodiens paruulos dominus, the Lorde hath helped Sion: And taken awaie this mad dogge, this wolfe, and this Lion. Qui erupit animam de morte, and my hart from sorowe, Now gentle maister Boner, God giue you good morowe. Lorde surely, thou hast giu? th? eternall rest, Whom Boner in prison, moste sore opprest. Placebo. Bo. Bo. Bo. Bo. Bo. Heu me, beware the bugge, out quod Boner alas, De profundis clamaui, how is this matter come to passe. Læuaui oculos meos, from a darke depe place. Now Lazarus helpe Diues, with one droppe of grace. Ne quando rapiat ut Leo animam mean., druggarde, druggarde, To defende this matter, came Ihon Auaile, and Miles Huggarde. From the gates of hell, quod the rebelles, dedefende B. Boner, That with S. Fissher and Becket, he maie haue honor. Amen quod R. C. B. H. and L. Deliuer hym from this paines of hell. R. Doe beginne the first lesson. Parce michi domine. Spare vs oh swete lord, our daies are all gone, Our holie father deare Boner, hath left vs alone. Now enclosed in tombe, wrapte in yearth and claie, Ecce nunc in pulucre dormit, doo rot &amp; fade awaie We hoped that he should haue doen, as he did before, Come forthe of prison ones againe, and burned more and more. Who shall trust temporall powers, in whom is no healthe, Fare well our spirituall father deare, our c?forte and wealthe. Now helpe, Dominicke, Becket, Dunston, and sainct Line, Gregorie with thy Trentals, Antonye with thy swine. This father was heauenly mynded, and neuer carnall, Therefore defende hym from the flames infernall. Responde. Praie for Boner B. and D. soules, You that walke in the Popishe ilde of Poles Ye praie for them, and thinke no skorne, The like of Boner was neuer borne. Boner. Et in carne mea videbo, the bones that I haue burned. And also Iesus Christe, against whom I haue sporned. I haue not one dogge tricke of legarde maine, Posuisti me tibi contrarium, heu me, greate paine. I crie to man, childe, and wife, I abhorred muche the booke of life: And loued moste the Popes lawes, And regarded not Christ twoo strawes. Ue miserum michi therefore, Sainct Peter haue locked the dore, And bidde me go the wrong waie, Bicause I had not the right waie. I will make an other shifte, Seyng I am driuen to this drifte, Now helpe holy father the Pope, With skalyng ladder and rope: Chaunce what chaunce maie fall, Now will I scale heauen wall. L. Doe rede the seconde lesson. Tedet animam meam. Oh his soule was wearie here, in the life that he had, His foode was breade and water, his lodgyng was to badde. Clothed in heere, slepyng againste the harde stones, That through fastyng, his skinne claue to the bones. Watchyng in praier, lamentyng bothe daie and night: Subduyng fleshlie affection, and walked in the spirite, Meeke in mynde as a Wolfe, and simple as a Foxe: As chaste as the he Goate, as slender as the Ore. As liberall as the she Beare, as swete as the Brocke, Of all kinde of linnen clothe, he loued well a smocke. As wholesome as a madde Dogge, as cleanly as a Bore, He loued well a fatte Pigge, so he did a h. Paale as the Turkie Cocke, as gentle as a Snake. The like is not in all helle, if you seeke hyn with a rake. Responde. Speake you of Boner? God saue his honor, Some saied thei heard hym saie, In bedde as he laie, Noli me condemnare, Dum veneris iudicaro, Ante te erubesco, Comissa mea panesco. Qui Lazarum resuscitasti, fr? stinking ?fishe? Farewell, farewell, you Popishe k. Te decet deus hymuus in Syon, Boner was as cruell as a Lion: For if he had liued, and the worlde tourned, Many a good man, he would haue burned. Per ignem with fire, That was his desire. T. The thirde lesson. Manus tue d?e fecerunt me. The hande of God framed hym ones in goodlie shape, Then transformed like a Boore, and conditioned like an Ape: From a Bishoppe to a Butcher, moste bloudie of kinde. Whiche often in Bastardes, the like you maie finde: There is a greate decree made by C. the pope That no Bastarde should weare staffe, miter or Cope: Neither hath any dignitie, vnder a Cathedrall steple, Bicause he is fatherlesse, and the sonne of the people: Abraham left inheritance, to Isaac his sonne by right; To his bastardes he gaue giftes, and put th? from his sight. So if bastardes bee vnworthie of Temporall inheritaunce, Muche lesse in Christes Churche, to haue any preheminence: This Boner was a bastarde, of bloudde and condition, And departed fr? this life, without contriti?. Responde. Lorde how he would pullam, When he was at Fullam, With fire, rodds, and chaines He put them to paines, And that was well seen, By M. and Bartlet green. O Lorde I praie thee in what place Shall bloudie E. Boner, past al graceg Hide his greasie blocke hedde, Wh? he shall iudge the quick &amp; dedde. Quid hoc rei est? Mary he shall rise like a beast, Emong the Romishe pied coates, On the lefte hande emong the goates He would not praie, Nor saie Mattens that daie, But swell and pante, If victuals were scante. But redde wine and a Pigge, Would make him lepe &amp; frig And saie diligo uxores uestras, Ab ortu solis ad uesperas. The fowerth lesson. Quantis habuit iniquitas. Howe sore was this bloudie beaste, fraught with synne, So fatte was his fleshe, scante holde would the skinne. Incrassatus, impiguatus, dilatatus, Symoniacus, Grosse, fat, and puffed vp with a great patus, Sacrificium deo nostro, cor contritum Tu autem argenteos lebetes, was thy delitum, Cur faci? tu? absc?disti like an oule in the night Refusing the blessed Gospel the word of light Thy cursed actes, in parchm?t shalbe inrolde, Against God &amp; thy prince, thou wert to bolde Thy bloudie crimes shall bee in mynde, now thou art gone and paste, Thou shalte make a dreadfull compt to God, for them at the laste. Responde. Iam fetet, quia putrifactus est, Which made the Papistes many a feast But in his cole house, he gaue no meate But in Smithfield moste cruell heate, Now death his power doe inuade, Like rotten donge, his fleshe doe fade, I doe not quarell, His guttes filled a barrell. Alas quod the Papistes and well awaie, He was buried in the night, not in the daie, Where were the Papistes that hower? Some in the Flete, some in the Tower, And many paste all grace, Be in euery Popishe place, God sende them suche honor, As hath their dadde Boner, Qui uomuit nigrum, post fata cruorem. The fifte lesson. Homo natus. Homo natus, Came to heauen gatus: Sir you doe come to latus, With your shorne patus. Frequentia falsa Euangelij, For the loue of your bealie, Cum auro &amp; argento, You loued the rules of Lento, Whiche the Pope did inuento You are spurius de muliere, Not legittimate nor lawful here O quam uenenosa pestis, Fur, periurus, latro mechus, Homicidus tantum decus, De salute animarum, Of Christes flocke thou hadest small carum. Thou art filius populi, Go, go, to Constantinopoli, To your maister the Turke, There shall you lurke: Emong the Heathen soules, Somtyme your shorne brethren of Poules, Were as blacke as Moules, With their cappes fower forked, Their shoes warme corked, Nosed like redde Grapes, Constant as she Apes, In nature like blacke Monkes, And shoote in Sparowes trunkes And boule when thei haue dinde, And kepe them from the winde, And thei whiche are not able, Doe sitte still at the table, With colour Scarlet pale So small is their good ale, Thus from God thei did tourne, L?g before their church did burne Then when riche men wer sicke, Either dedde or quicke, Valde diligenter notant, Vbi diuites egrotant, Ibi currunt, nec cessabunt, Donec ipsos tumilabunt, Oues alienas tondunt, Et perochias confundunt. These felowes pilde as Ganders, Muche like the friers of Fl?ders, Whiche serue Sathan about the cloisters, Thei loue red wine and Disters, Qui uult Satanæ seruire Claustrum debet introire, And euer haue suche an hedde, As bastarde Boner that is dedde: He would for the Pope take pain, Therfore help you friers of spain: You enquisiters take paine, It is a greate maine. Unto the Pope your hedde, That Boner is thus dedde, And buried in a misers graue, Like a common k. Lo, lo, now is he dedde, That was so well fedde, And had a softe bedde. Estote fortis in bello. Good Hardyng and thy fellowe: If you be Papistes right, Come steale hym awaie by night And put hym in a shrine, He was the Popes deuine, Why, shall he be forgotten, And lye still and rotten: Come on and doe not fainte, Translate with spede your sainct. And put hym in a tombe, His harte is now at Rome. Come forth you loughtes of Lou? And steale awaie this slouen, You are so full of Ire, And Popishe desire: And Romishe derision, And hellishe deuision. Therefore I am sure, Your kyngdome will not dure. Crescit rancor, crescit ira, Crescit &amp; inuidia, Totus Louen in errorem, Voluiter in caligine, Nullus curat obidire, Verbis Iesu Christi, Fides ? Roma n? apparet, Totus Louen fide carit. Thus he must tourne to duste, In Louen there is none to truste. As slipperie as Eles, The worlde doe run on wheles, Now helpe old frendes of Poules And praie for our soules: This is our desire, From these flames of fire. Iam in Purgatorij, Oh. L. R. G. and F. be sorie, Breuis eius dies sunt, He breathed ouer Poules Funte Ridiant me inimici, But all you that bee wisie, Beware of Papistrie all, The Chequer, &amp; westminster hall And all the Innes of Courte, I doe not scoffe nor sporte. And all this greate citie, It is greate pitie: That I Edmonde Boner, Against Goddes greate honor, Haue drawen you from truthe, Oh this is greate ruthe. Comissa mea pauesco, Et ante te tremesco, Dum veneris iudicare, Quare, quare, quare, quare. Fremuerunt Gentes. I beshrowe the Popes dentes In cathedra Moysi impij sedent, Therefore repent, repent, repent Tempus est vos reuertendi, Tempus est nobis non penidendi, Tempus est vos rediundi, Ab errore falsi mundi False Papistes, and false theeues Shall euer haue paines &amp; greues, Thus did Boner sore lamente, Mouyng Christes to repente. Responde. Ne recorderis peccata, He was full of hata Regardyng non estata, Et quasi flos, with his greate nose, Fugit uelut umbra, Thei morne for hym in north?bria The sixte lesson. Quis michi hoc tribuat. One alas in dreadfull dreame, poore Boner did beholde: In wofull weede attired foule, sometyme was braue in golde. With fierie stroke sore beaten was, that sometyme had smitten other: He was as sore turmented there, as Cain that slewe his brother. His salte teares ran doune apace, with bloudie hande he strake his breast: A worme about his harte bewrapte, that reaued hym of his reste. About this gooste flocked a rablement, of Friers fatte and foule: Then cried out a little spirite, like a shrikyng Dule. Ve, ve, and out alas, thy vengeaunce doe now begin: These flames and floudes, &amp; dungeons deepe, are wages all for synne. Come drinke thy fill in Lethæ flod and then to Styx retourne: Forget thy self, denaye thy God, lo, this is a place to burne. The wicked ones, whiche ordeined were, as chaffe caste from the corne: So in this bloudie Cocytus, thou shalt be rent and torne. Quis michi tribuat quod Boner tho shall I in this place dwell: Let me be clensed in Purgatorie, awaie you fiendes of hell, Donec, donec, my trentals are doen in the Churche of Rome: Tary here said the M?kes blacke vntill the daie of dome. With that he swelde with lothly looke, criyng, now haue I nede: Where are become my Romishe frendes, where is good Henry Crede? Miseremini mei, miseremini mei, if merites maie me saue: Suche measure as you haue measured other men, suche measure shall you haue. Quis potest facere mundum, a bastarde wert thou borne: De immundo conseptum semine, now art thou rente and torne. Burnt and dround and neuer dede we haue none other place: Spes impiorum peribit, we are exclude all from grace. Non remittitur ei in hoc seculo, neque in alio. You are condempned by the Iudge, to dwell still in our gailio. Et sicut dies marcennarij, thy daies are made an ende: An enemie to the Lorde thy God, but to the Pope a frende. Then cast thei hym in Melas flood moste darcke and blacke in sight In dreadfull slepe a man did se, this vision in the night. Responde. Ne recorderis peccata, But open heauen gata Sainct Peter with your kaies, Shewe my lorde the right waies He dwelt ones at Poules, And had cure of our soules: I wisse he was not a baste, But holie, meke, and chaste: It is a greate pitie, That he is gone from our citie: A man of greate honor, Oh holy sainct Boner, You blessed Friers, That neuer wer liers: And you holy Nunnes That neuer had s?nes Set this child of grace, In some Angelles place. Dum veneris iudicare, Helpe, helpe S. Marie Noli eum condemnare, He burned many in the daies of Quene Marie. Sicut Leo querens prædam, animas deuorauit. If this was not a blessed deede, Aske L. R. S. P. and H. Crede. The seventh lesson. Spiritus meus. My spirit God wotte, is feble, weake and sore: and so shall wee Papistes, daiely more and more. Our tyme of Papistrie shalbe shorte, foolishe and vaine. Ab aquilone panditur omne malum, the Papistes tooke paine. Nowe Mars our bloudie Boner is laied in yearth full colde: Whose life and libertie, would haue made vs bolde. With bloudie handes, and cruell hartes was our desire: To haue burned the Protestantes, with hote flamyng fire. Set vp thorne crounes (the stewes) and Monkes in bootes: And destroied Christes doctrine cleane by the rootes Brought in Idols, Latin seruice, and ryngyng of belles. Erected Chauntries, Masses, Abbaies, and Celles. Thus we would haue dooen, in Tindall, and Comberlande. And brought Romishe seruice, againe into Northumberlande. There are a remnaunt left, I maie them call The children of Antichrist, and of God Ball. Rumor super rumorem, while the storme do last, Antichrist and his, are now at the laste caste. And Boner is rotten, and stinketh in graue: Well rid is Christes flocke, of so Woluishe a K. Si veritatem dico, quare non creditis michi? The Responde. Dies eius breuiabuntur, Boner was a greate hunter: Per ignem with fire hotte, Nunc in putredine God wotte Ubi est ergo nunc Either Frier, Nonne, or Monke, That can for a little space, Put hym a purgyng place: Now good man sir Pope, What doe your worship hope In inferno nulla est redemptio. The eight lesson. Fo. rede it. Pelle mei consumptus. My fleshe is consumed, there is but skinne and bone: In sainct Georges Churche yarde, my graue and I alone. My tongue that vsed lewde woordes, and lippes awaie are rotten: Take pitie vpon me. R. L. and H. let me not be forgotten. Regester me in with a Leaden penne, emong the Romishe roules, And make some Obsequi for my sake, I would it were in Poules. Saie Dirige for me gentle T. H. U. R. L. and B. Saie you the Masse, mourne you in blacke, W. F. and C. Ryng you the belles, holde you the lightes A. P. S. and N. A. B. the Crosrowe of Papistes, shewe your selues like men. For if your merites doe not helpe, then come I verie late: Like the foolishe virgines fiue, which knocked at the gate. To whom he saied, I knowe you not, depart from my sight: You wanted faithe, and watched not, when I came in the night. Let liuyng wightes, watche therfore, though it be paine and griefe: For sodainly the Lorde dooe come, vnwares like to a thefe. O Boner, Boner, ones againe, in thy skynne thou shalt be clad: And haue suche members in degree, as in this life thou had. Then shalt thou see the Martyrs all, in iudgement stande vpright: Whom in this worlde thou didest abuse with murder, and with spight. And called them vnlearned all, and nowe in greate honor: Suche was the blindnes of Papistes hartes, and specially of thee Boner. The Responde. Uaine, vaine, vaine, vaine, All bloudie Papistes doe liue in vaine. There is no meane, but heauen and hell In doyng euill, and workyng well. Eche soule shall go vnto his place: The brande of hell, and childe of grace. Scimus quia transit hora, Redeamus sine mora, Uitam nostram emendamus, The hower of death, drawyng on a pace Praie for mercie, ioye, and grace: Vade &amp; non amplius peccare. The nineth lesson. Quare de vulua. S. rede. it. Alas from my mothers wombe, why hast thou brought me out? I haue liued like a Butchers dogge and died like a loute. I stopped myne eares against the truthe, Gods worde I would not heare: And hardened my harte against the Prince, in persone many a yere. There ledde my life in hartes delite, my soule did feele no care: In softe bedde, and choise of wine, wantyng no daintie fare. False hope I had to come forthe, as ones I did before: But still dispaire, said I should die and persecute no more. One morne betime I loked forth, as ofte as I did before: And did se a pulpit, in churches wise, made by my prison dore. A Preacher there was, that Crowlye hight, whiche preached in that place, A meane if God had loued me, to call me then to grace. Hodie si vocem, was his theme, and harden not thyne harte: As did the fathers the rebelles old that perished in desarte, Thus protestantes, haue me slain with the power of the worde: But if the worlde had serued me, with fire, and with sworde. I would haue killed and burned al more then I did before: But now farewel you papistes al from hensforthe euermore. Would no wight had me knowen nor eyes me neuer seen: Then should I haue been in suche sorte, as I had neuer been. The Responde. In die illa tremenda, Who shall my lorde defenda: Neither Pe. Wes. Nor. Mar. Traitors Tempest that blowe vp warre, Slinge. Hil. nor Swineburne, Or any traitor, that gape for a tourne. Thei shall haue horror inhabitans, God sende them mischaunce. Omne regnum diuisum. &amp;c. Against the Quene thei risum, Per aliam viam reuersi sunt. Papistes are traitours, as thei are wont. Rumor super rumorem erit. Betwene Doncaster and Perith, Be many Popishe hartes, Would their heddes wer in carts. And their bodies in graues: Rebelles are theues and knaues. Ardiet pugnas vicio parentum, The rebelles beyonde Trentham Shall quickly repentham. Sepulchrum paten: est venter eorum. Thei abhorre doctrina Apostolorum Sepe expugnauer?t you know it wel Northren stormes are sharp &amp; fell Snowe, Haile, Ise, and Froste, All their hope is but loste. Dies magnæ &amp; amara. Thei are now in sorow and cara Thei will neuer haue suche honor As had this bastarde E. Boner. Although he were a Po[illeg.] k[illeg.] Yet buried he was in a graue, Pluet super proditores laquios. The'nde of Boners Dirige.</field>
