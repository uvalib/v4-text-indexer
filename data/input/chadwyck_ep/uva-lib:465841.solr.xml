      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE FIRST. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ELIZABETH COUNTESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND: IN HER OWN RIGHT BARONESS PERCY, LUCY, POYNINGS, FITZ-PAYNE, BRYAN, AND LATIMER. I never heard the old song of Percie and Douglas, that I found not my heart moved more than with a trumpet: and yet ‘it’ is sung but by some blinde crowder, with no rougher voice, than rude stile; which beeing so evill apparelled in the dust and cobweb of that uncivill age, what would it work, trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindare? Sir Philip Sydney's Defence of Poetry. ANCIENT SONGS AND BALLADS, &amp;c. SERIES THE FIRST. BOOK I. I THE ANCIENT BALLAD OF CHEVY-CHASE. The fine heroic song of Chevy-Chase has ever been admired by competent judges. Those genuine strokes of nature and artless passion, which have endeared it to the most simple readers, have recommended it to the most refined; and it has equally been the amusement of our childhood, and the favourite of our riper years. Mr. Addison has given an excellent critique Spectator, No. 70. 74. on this very popular ballad, but is mistaken with regard to the antiquity of the common received copy; for this, if one may judge from the style, cannot be older than the time of Elizabeth, and was probably written after the elogium of Sir Philip Sidney: perhaps in consequence of it. I flatter myself, I have here recovered the genuine antique poem: the true original song, which appeared rude even in the time of Sir Philip, and caused him to lament, that it was so evil-apparelled in the rugged garb of antiquity. This curiosity is printed; from an old manuscript, at the end of Hearne's preface to Gul. Newbrigiensis Hist. 1719. 8 vo. vol. 1. To the MS. Copy is subjoined the name of the author, Rychard Sheale Subscribed, after the usual manner of our old poets, expliceth [explicit] quoth Rychard Sheale.: whom Hearne had so little judgment as to suppose to be the same with a R. Sheale, who was living in 1588. But whoever examines the gradation of language and idiom in the following volumes, will be convinced that this is the production of an earlier poet. It is indeed expressly mentioned among some very ancient songs in an old book intituled, The Complaint of Scotland One of the earliest productions of the Scottish press, now to be found. The title-page was wanting in the copy here quoted; but it is supposed to have been printed in 1540. See Ames., (fol. 42.) under the title of the Huntis of Chevet, where the two following lines are also quoted; The Perssee and the Mongumrye mette See Pt. 2. v. 25.. That day, that day, that gentil day See Pt. 1. v. 104.: Which, tho' not quite the same as they stand in the ballad, yet differ not more than might be owing to the author's quoting from memory. Indeed whoever considers the style and orthography of this old poem will not be inclined to place it lower than the time of Henry VI: as on the other hand the mention of Iames the Scottish king Pt. 2. v. 36. 140., with one or two Anachronisms, forbid us to assign it an earlier date. King James I. who was prisoner in this kingdom at the death of his father Who died Aug. 5. 1406, in the 7th year of our Hen. IV., did not wear the crown of Scotland till the second year of our Henry VI James I. was crowned May 22. 1424. murdered Feb. 21. 1436–7., but before the end of that long reign a third James had mounted the throne In 1460.—Hen. VI. was deposed 1461: restored and slain 1471.. A succession of two or three Jameses, and the long detention of one of them in England, would render the name familiar to the English, and dispose a poet in those rude time to give it to any Scottish king he happened to mention. So much for the date of this old ballad: with regard to its subject, altho' it has no countenance from history, there is room to think it had originally some foundation in fact. It was one of the Laws of the Marches frequently renewed between the two nations, that neither party should hunt in the other's borders, without leave from the proprietors or their deputies Item. . . Concordatum est, quod, . . . nullus unius partis vel alterius ingrediatur terras, boschas, forrestas, warrenas, loca, dominia quæcunque alicujus partis alterius subditi, causa venandi, piscandi, aucupandi, disportum aut solatium in eisdem, aliave quacunque de causa, absque licentia ejus . . . . ad quem . . . loca . . . . . . pertinent, aut de deputatis suis prius capt. &amp; obtent. Vid. Œp. Nicholson's Leges Marchiarum. 1705. 8 vo. pag. 27. 51.. There had long been a rivalship between the two martial families of Percy and Douglas, which heightened by the national quarrel, must have produced frequent challenges and struggles for superiority, petty invasions of their respective domains, and sharp contests for the point of honour; which would not always be recorded in history. Something of this kind we may suppose gave rise to the ancient ballad of the Hunting a' the Cheviat This was the original title. See the ballad, Pt. 1. v. 106. Pt. 2. v. 165.. Percy earl of Northumberland had vowed to hunt for three days in the Scottish border without condescending to ask leave from earl Douglas, who was either lord of the soil, or lord warden of the marches. Douglas would not fail to resent the insult, and endeavour to repel the intruders by force: this would naturally produce a sharp conflict between the two parties: something of which, it is probable, did really happen, tho' not attended with the tragical circumstances recorded in the ballad: for these are evidently borrowed from the Battle of Otterbourn See the next ballad., a very different event, but which aftertimes would easily confound with it. That battle might be owing to some such previous affront as this of Chevy Chase, though it has escaped the notice of historians. Our poet has evidently jumbled the two events together: if indeed the lines Vid. Pt. 2. v. 167. in which this mistake is made, are not rather spurious, and the after-insertion of some person, who did not distinguish between the two stories. Hearne has printed this ballad without any division of stanzas, in long lines, as he found it in the old written copy: but it is usual to find the distinction of stanzas neglected in ancient MSS; where, to save room, two or three verses are frequently given in one line undivided. See flagrant instances in the Harleian Catalog. No. 2253. s. 29. 34. 61. 70. &amp; passim. The First Part.

The style of this and the following ballad is uncommonly rugged and uncouth, owing to their being writ in the very coarsest and broadest northern Dialect. The battle of Hombyll-down, or Humbleton, was fought Sept. 14. 1402. (anno 3. Hen. IV.) wherein the English, under the command of the E. of Northumberland, and his son Hotspur, gained a compleat victory over the Scots. The village of Humbleton is one mile north-west from Wooller in Northumberland: near it are two hills, which retain to this day evident marks of encampments.—Humbleton is in Glendale ward, a district so named in this county, and mentioned above in ver. 163. II. THE BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE. The only battle, wherein an Earl of Douglas was slain fighting with a Percy, was that of Otterbourn, which is the subject of this ballad. It is here related with the allowable partiality of an English poet, and much in the same manner as it is recorded in the English Chronicles. The Scottish writers have, with a partiality at least as excuseable, related it no less in their own favour. Luckily we have a very circumstantial narrative of the whole affair from Froissart a French historian, who appears to be unbiassed. Froissart's relation is prolix; I shall therefore give it as abridged by Carte, who has however had recourse to other authorities, and differs from Froissart in some things, which I shall note in the margin. In the twelfth year of Richard II, 1388, “The Scots taking advantage of the confusions of this nation, and falling with a party into the west-marches, ravaged the country about Carlisle, and carried off 300 prisoners. It was with a much greater force, headed by some of the principal nobility, that, in the beginning of August Froissart speaks of both parties (consisting in all of more than 40,000 men) as entering England at the same time: but the greater part by way of Carlisle., they invaded Northumberland: and having wasted part of the county of Durham And, according to the ballad, that part of Northumberland called Bamboroughshire; a large tract of land so named from the town and castle of Bamborough; formerly the residence of the Northumbrian Kings., advanced to the gates of Newcastle; where, in a skirmish, they took a ‘penon’ or colours This circumstance is omitted in the ballad. Hotspur and Douglas were two young warriors much of the same age. belonging to Henry lord Percy, surnamed Hotspur, son to the earl of Northumberland. In their retreat home, they attacked the castle of Otterbourn: and in the evening of Aug. 9. (as the English writers say, or rather, according to Froissart, Aug. 15.) after an unsuccessful assault were surprized in their camp, which was very strong, by Henry, who at the first onset put them into a good deal of confusion. But James earl of Douglas rallying his men, there ensued one of the best-fought actions that happened in that age; both armies shewing the utmost bravery Froissart says the English exceeded the Scots in number three to one, but that these had the advantage of the ground, and were also fresh from sleep, while the English were greatly fatigued with their previous march.: the earl Douglas himself being slain on the spot By Henry L. Percy, according to this ballad, and our old English historians, as Stow, Speed, &amp;c. but borne down by numbers, if we may believe Froissart.; the earl of Murrey mortally wounded; and Hotspur Hotspur (after a very sharp conflict) was taken prisoner by John lord Montgomery, whose eldest son Sir Hugh was slain in the same action with an arrow, according to Crawfurd's Peerage (and seems also to be alluded to in the foregoing ballad, p. 13.) but taken prisoner and exchanged for Hotspur, according to this ballad., with his brother Ralph Percy, taken prisoners. These disasters on both sides have given occasion to the event of the engagement's being disputed; Froissart (who derives his relation from a Scotch knight, two gentlemen of the same country, and as many of Foix Froissart (according to the Eng. Translation) says he had his account from two squires of England, and from a knight and squire of Scotland, soon after the battle.) affirming that the Scots remained masters of the field; and the English writers insinuating the contrary. These last maintain that the English had the better of the day: but night coming on, some of the northern lords, coming with the bishop of Durham to their assistance, killed many of them by mistake, supposing them to be Scots; and the earl of Dunbar at the same time falling on another side upon Hotspur, took him and his brother prisoners, and carried them off while both parties were fighting. It is at least certain, that immediately after this battle the Scots engaged in it made the best of their way home: and the same party was taken by the other corps about Carlisle.” Such is the account collected by Carte, in which he seems not to be free from partiality: for prejudice must own that Froissart's circumstantial account carries a great appearance of truth, and he gives the victory to the Scots. He however does justice to the courage of both parties; and represents their mutual generosity in such a light, that the present age might edify by the example. “The Englysshmen on the one partye, and Scottes on the other party, are good men of warre, for whan they mete, there is a hard fighte without sparynge. There is no hoo So in Langham's letter concerning Q. Elizabeth's entertainment at Killingworth Castle, 1575. 12°. p. 61. “Heer was no ho in devout drinkyng.” betwene them as long as speares, swordes, axes, or dagers wyll endure; but lay on eche upon other: and whan they be well beaten, and that the one party hath obtayned the victory, they than glorifye so in their dedes of armes, and are so joyfull, that suche as be taken, they shall be ransomed or they go out of the felde i.e. They scorn to take the advantage, or to keep them lingering in long captivity.; so that shortely eche of them is so contente with other, that at their departynge, curtoysly they will saye, God thanke you. But in fyghtynge one with another there is no playe, nor sparynge.” Froissart's Cronycle, (as translated by Sir Johan Bourchier Lord Berners) Cap. cxlij. The following ballad is printed from a manuscript copy in the Harleian Collection [No. 293. fol. 52.] where it is intitled, “A songe made in R. 2. his tyme of the battele of Otterburne, betweene Lord Henry Percye earle of Northomberlande and the earle Douglas of Scotlande, Anno 1388.”—But this title is erroneous, and added by some ignorant transcriber of after-times: for, 1. The battle was not fought by the earl of Northumberland, who was absent, nor is once mentioned in the ballad; but by his son Sir Henry Percy, Knt. surnamed Hotspur, (in those times they did not usually give the title of Lord to an earl's eldest son.) 2. Altho' the battle was fought in Richard IId's time, the song is evidently of later date, as appears from the poet's quoting the chronicles in ver. 130; and speaking of Percy in the last stanza as dead. It was however written in all likelihood as early as the foregoing song, if not earlier; which perhaps may be inferred from the minute circumstances with which the story is related, many of which are recorded in no chronicle, and were probably preserved in the memory of old people. It will be observed that the authors of these two poems have some lines in common; but which of them was the original proprietor, must depend upon their priority; and this the sagacity of the reader must determine. Yt felle about the Lamas tyde, When hosbandes winn their haye, winn their haye. This is the reading in Crawford's Peerage, p. 97; and this is the Northumberland phrase to this day: by which they always express “getting in their bay.” The orig. MS. reads here winn their waye. The dughtie Douglas bowned him to ride, In England to take a praye: The earle of Fyffe Robert Stuart, second son of K. Robert II., withouten striffe, He bounde him over Sulway i. e. “over Solway frith.” This evidently refers to the other division of the Scottish army, which came in by way of Carlisse.—Bounde him; i. e. hied him. Vid. Gloss.: The grete wold ever together ride; That race they may rue for aye. Over ‘Ottercap’ hill they They: sc. the earl of Douglas and his party.—The several stations here mentioned, are well-known places in Northumberland. Ottercap hill is in the parish of Kirk-Whelpington, in Tynedale-ward. Rodeliffe- (or as it is more usually pronounced Rodeley-) Cragge is a noted cliff near Rodeley, a small village in the parish of Hartburn, in Morpethward: It lies south-east of Ottercap. Green Leyton is another small village in the same parish of Hartburn, and is south-east of Rodeley.— The orig.

Uppon the morowe, when it was daye, The standards shone fulle brighte; To the New Castelle they tooke the waye, And thither they came fulle right. Sir Henrye Percy laye at the New Castelle, I telle you withouten dreede; He had bine a marche-man Marche-man, i. e. a scowrer of the marches. all his dayes, And kepte Barwicke upon Tweed.

Yf thou hast harried all Bambarowe shire, Thou haste done me great envie; For the trespas thou haste me done, The tone of us shall dye.” Wher shall I byde thee, said the Douglas? Or wher wilte thou come to me? “At Otterburne in the highe waye Otterbourn stands near the old Watling-street road, being in the parish of Elsdon, and lying three miles west of that town. The remains of the Scottish encampment are still visible., Theare maieste thou well lodged be. The ‘roe’ full rekeles ther she runes, Roe-bucks were to be found upon the wastes not far from Hexham within these forty years.—Whitfield, Esq; of Whitfield, is said to have destroyed the last of them.

Ther shall I byde thee, said the Douglas, By the faithe of my bodye. Ther shall I come, sayes Sir Harye Percy; My trowthe I plighte to thee. A pipe of wyne he gave him over the walles, For south, as I you saye: Theare he made the Douglas drinke, And all his hoste that daye.

Naye by my trowthe, the Douglas sayde, It is but a fained call: The durste not looke one my bred bannor, For all England to haylle. Was I not yesterdaye at the Newe Castell, That stands so fayere one Tyne? For all the men the Percye hade, He could not gare me once to dyne. He steped out at his pavillian dore, To looke and it were lesse; Arraye you, lordinges, one and all, For heare begyns no peace. The earle of Mentaye The earl of Menteith. At the time of this battle the Earldom of Menteith was possessed by Robert Stewart, Earl of Fise, third son of K. Robert II. who, according to Buchanan, commanded the Scots that entered by Carlisle. But our Minstrel had probably an eye to the family of Graham, who had this Earldom when the ballad was written.

THE JEW'S DAUGHTER, A Scottish Ballad, —Is founded upon the supposed practice of the Jews in crucifying or otherwise murthering Christian children; out of hatred to the religion of their parents: a practice, which hath been always alledged in excuse for the cruelties exercised upon that wretched people, but which probably never happened in a single instance. For if we consider, on the one hand, the ignorance and superstition of the times when such stories took their rise, the virulent prejudices of the monks who record them, and the eagerness with which they would be catched up by the barbarous populace as a pretence for plunder; on the other hand, the great danger incurred by the perpetrators, and the inadequate motives they could have to excite them to a crime of so much horror, we may reasonably conclude the whole charge to be groundless and malicious. The following ballad is probably built upon some Italian Legend, and bears a great resemblance to the Prioresse's Tale in Chaucer: the poet seems also to have had an eye to the known story of Hugh of Lincoln, a child said to have been there murthered by the Jews in the reign of Henry III. The conclusion of this ballad appears to be wanting: what it probably contained may be seen in Chaucer. As for Mirryland Toun, it is probably a corruption of Milan (called by the Dutch Meylandt) Town; since the Pa is evidently the river Po. Printed from a MS. copy sent from Scotland. The rain rins doun through Mirry-land toune, Sae dois it doune the Pa: Sae dois the lads of Mirry-land toune, Quhan they play at the ba'. Than out and cam the Jewis dochtèr, Said, Will ye cum in and dine? I winnae cum in, I cannae cum in, Without my play-feres nine. Scho powd an apple reid and white To intice the zong thing in: Scho powd an apple white and reid, And that the sweit bairne did win. And scho has taine out a little pen-knife, And low down by her gair, Scho has twin'd the zong thing and his life; A word he nevir spak mair. And out and cam the thick thick bluid, And out and cam the thin; And out and cam the bonny herts bluid: Thair was nae life left in. Scho laid him on a dressing borde, And drest him like a swine, And laughing said, Gae nou and pley With zour sweit play-feres nine. Scho rowd him in a cake of lead, Bade him lie stil and sleip. Scho cast him in a deip draw-well, Was fifty fadom deip. Quhan bells wer rung, and mass was sung, And every lady went hame: Than ilka lady had her zong sonne, Bot lady Helen had nane. Scho rowd hir mantil hir about, And sair sair gan she weip: And she ran into the Jewis castèl, Quhan they wer all asleip. My bonny sir Hew, my pretty sir Hew, I pray thee to me speik: ‘O lady, rinn to the deip draw-well ‘Gin ze zour sonne wad seik.’ Lady Helen ran to the deip draw-well, And knelt upon her kne: My bonny sir Hew, an ze be here, I pray thee speik to me. The lead is wondrous heavy, mither, The well is wondrous deip, A keen pen-knife sticks in my hert, A word I dounae speik. Gae hame, gae hame, my mither deir, Fetch me my windling sheet, And at the back o' Mirry-land toun, Its thair we twa sall meet. IV. SIR CAULINE. This old romantic tale was preserved in the Editor's folio MS, but in so defective and mutilated a condition that it was necessary to supply several stanzas in the first part, and still more in the second, to connect and compleat the story. There is something peculiar in the metre of this old ballad: it is not unusual to meet with redundant stanzas of six lines; but the occasional insertion of a double third or fourth line, as ver. 31, 44, &amp;c. is an irregularity I do not remember to have seen elsewhere. It may be proper to inform the reader before he comes to Pt. 2. v. 110, 111. that the round table was not peculiar to the reign of K. Arthur, but was common in all the ages of Chivalry. The proclaiming a great turnament (probably with some peculiar solemnities) was called “holding a Round Table.” Dugdale tells us, that the great baron Roger de Mortimer “having procured the honour of knighthood to be conferred ‘on his three sons’ by K. Edw. I. he, at his own costs, caused a tourneament to be held at Kenilworth; where he sumptuously entertained an hundred knights, and as many ladies for three days; the like whereof was never before in England; and there began the round table, (so called by reason that the place wherein they practised those feats, was environed with a strong wall made in a round form:) And upon the fourth day, the golden lion, in sign of triumph, being yielded to him; he carried it (with all the company) to Warwick.”—It may further be added, that Matthew Paris frequently calls justs and turnaments Hasti Iudia Mensæ Rotundæ. As to what will be observed in this ballad of the art of healing being practised by a young princess; it is no more than what is usual in all the old romances, and was conformable to real manners; it being a practice derived from the earliest times among all the Gothic and Celtic nations, for [illeg.]men, even of the highest rank, to exercise the art of surgery. In the Northern Chronicles we always find the young damsels stanching the wounds of their lovers, and the wives those of their husbands See Descript. of the ancient Danes, vol. 1. p. 318. Memoires de la Chevalerie. Tom. 1. p. 44.. And even so late as the time of Q. Elizabeth, it is mentioned among the accomplishments of the ladies of her court, that the “eldest of them are skilful in surgery.” See Harrison's Description of England, prefixed to Hollingshed's Chronicle, &amp;c. The First Part. In Ireland, ferr over the sea, There dwelleth a bonnye kinge; And with him a yong and comlye knighte, Men call him syr Caulìne. The kinge had a ladye to his daughter, In fashyon she hath no peere; And princely wightes that ladye wooed To be theyr wedded feere. Syr Cauline loveth her best of all, But nothing durst he saye; Ne descreeve his counsayl to no man, But deerlye he lovde this may. Till on a daye it so beffell, Great dill to him was dight; The maydens love removde his mynd, To care-bed went the knighte. One while he spred his armes him fro, One while he spred them nye: And aye! but I winne that ladyes love, For dole now I mun dye. And whan our parish-masse was done, Our kinge was bowne to dyne: He sayes, Where is syr Cauline, That is wont to serve the wyne? Then aunswerde him a courteous knighte, And fast his handes gan wringe: Sir Cauline is sicke, and like to dye Without a good leechìnge. Fetche me downe my daughter deere, She is a leeche fulle fine: Goe take him doughe, and the baken bread, And serve him with the wyne soe red; Lothe I were him to tine. Fair Christabelle to his chaumber goes, Her maydens followyng nye: O well, she sayth, how doth my lord? O sicke, thou fayr ladyè. Nowe ryse up wightlye, man, for shame, Never lye soe cowardlee; For it is told in my fathers halle, You dye for love of mee. Fayre ladye, it is for your love That all this dill I drye: For if you wold comfort me with a kisse, Then were I brought from bale to blisse, No lenger wold I lye. Sir knighte, my father is a kinge, I am his onlye heire; Alas! and well you knowe, syr knighte, I never can be youre fere. O ladye, thou art a kinges daughtèr, And I am not thy peere, But let me doe some deedes of armes To be your bacheleere. Some deedes of armes if thou wilt doe, My bacheleere to bee, (But ever and aye my heart wold rue, Giff harm shold happe to thee,) Upon Eldridge hill there groweth a thorne, Upon the mores brodìnge; And dare ye, syr knighte, wake there all nighte Untill the fayre mornìnge? For the Eldridge knighte, so mickle of mighte, Will examine you beforne: And never man bare life awaye, But he did him scath and scorne. That knighte he is a foul paynìm, And large of limb and bone; And but if heaven may be thy speede, Thy life it is but gone. Nowe on the Eldridge hilles Ile walke, For thy sake, fair ladìe; And Ile either bring you a ready tokèn, Or Ile never more you see. The lady is gone to her own chaumbère, Her maydens following bright: Syr Cauline lope from care-bed soone, And to the Eldridge hills is gone, For to wake there all night. Unto midnight, that the moone did rise, He walked up and downe; Then a lightsome bugle heard he blowe Over the bents soe browne: Quoth hee, If cryance come till my heart, I am ffar from any good towne. This line is restored from the folio MS. And soone he spyde on the mores so broad, A furyous wight and fell; A ladye bright his brydle led, Clad in a fayre kyrtèll: And soe fast he called on syr Caulìne, O man, I rede thee flye, For ‘but’ if cryance come till thy heart, I weene but thou mun dye. He sayth, ‘No’ cryance comes till my heart, Nor, in faith, I wyll not flee; For, cause thou minged not Christ before, The less me dreadeth thee. The Eldridge knighte, he pricked his steed; Syr Cauline bold abode: Then either shooke his trustye speare, And the timber these two children i. e. Knights. See the ballad of Child Waters, vol. 3. p. 54. bare Soe soone in sunder slode. Then tooke they out theyr two good swordes, And layden on full faste, Till helme and hawberke, mail and sheelde, They all were well-nye brast. The Eldridge knight was mickle of might, And stiffe in stower did stande, But syr Cauline with a ‘backward’ stroke, aukeward. MS. He smote off his right-hand; That soone he with paine and lacke of bloud Fell downe on that lay-land. Then up syr Cauline lift his brande All over his head so hye: And here I sweare by the holy roode, Nowe, caytiffe, thou shalt dye. Then up and came that ladye brighte, Faste wringing of her hande: For the maydens love, that most you love, Withold that deadlye brande. For the maydens love, that most you love, Now smyte no more I praye; And aye whatever thou wilt, my lord, He shall thy hests obaye. Now sweare to mee, thou Eldridge knighte, And here on this lay-land, That thou wilt believe on Christ his laye, And therto plight thy hand: And that thou never on Eldridge come To sporte, gamon, or playe: And that thou here give up thy armes Until thy dying daye. The Eldridge knighte gave up his armes With many a sorrowfulle sighe; And sware to obey syr Caulines hest, Till the tyme that he shold dye. And he then up and the Eldridge knighte Sett him in his saddle anone, And the Eldridge knighte and his ladye To theyr castle are they gone. Then he tooke up the bloudy hand, That was so large of bone, And on it he founde five ringes of gold Of knightes that had be slone. Then he tooke up the Eldridge sworde, As hard as any flint: And he tooke off those ringès five, As bright as fyre and brent. Home then pricked syr Cauline As light as leafe on tree: I-wys he neither stint ne blanne, Till he his ladye see. Then downe he knelt upon his knee Before that lady gay: O ladye, I have bin on the Eldridge hills; These tokens I bring away. Now welcome, welcome, syr Caulìne, Thrice welcome unto mee, For now I perceive thou art a true knighte, Of valour bolde and free. O ladye, I am thy own true knighte, Thy hests for to obaye: And mought I hope to winne thy love!— Ne more his tonge colde say. The ladye blushed scarlette redde, And fette a gentill sighe: Alas! syr knight, how may this bee, For my degree's soe highe? But sith thou hast hight, thou comely youth, To be my batchilere, Ile promise if thee I may not wedde I will have none other fere. Then shee held forthe her lilly-white hand Towards that knighte so free: He gave to it one gentill kisse, His heart was brought from bale to blisse, The teares sterte from his ee. But keep my counsayl, syr Caulìne, Ne let no man it knowe; For and ever my father sholde it ken, I wot he wolde us sloe. From that daye forthe that ladye fayre Lovde syr Caulìne the knighte: From that daye forthe he only joyde Whan shee was in his sight. Yea and oftentimes they mette Within a fayre arbòure, Where they in love and sweet daliaunce Past manye a pleasaunt houre. In this conclusion of the First Part, and at the beginning of the Second, the reader will observe a resemblance to the story of Sigismunda and Guiscard, as told by Boccace and Dryden: See the latter's Description of the Lovers meeting in the Cave, and those beautiful lines, which contain a reflection so like this of our poet, “everye white, &amp;c. viz. “But as extremes are short of ill and good, “And tides at highest mark regorge their flood; “So Fate, that could no more improve their joy, “Took a malicious pleasure to destroy. “Tancred, who fondly loved, &amp;c.” Part the Second. Everye white will have its blacke, And everye sweete its sowre: This founde the ladye Christabelle In an untimely howre. For so it befelle as syr Caulìne Was with that ladye faire, The kinge her father walked forthe To take the evenyng aire: And into the arboure as he went To rest his wearye feet, He found his daughter and syr Caulìne Theresette in daliaunce sweet. The kinge hee sterted forthe, I-wys, And an angrye man was hee: Nowe, traytoure, thou shalt hange or drawe, And rewe shall thy ladìe. Then forthe syr Cauline he was ledde, And throwne in dungeon deepe: And the ladye into a towre so hye, There left to wayle and weepe. The queene she was syr Caulines friend, And to the kinge sayd shee: I praye you save syr Caulines life, And let him banisht bee. Now, dame, that traitor shall be sent Across the salt sea some: But here I will make thee a band, If ever he come within this land, A foule deathe is his doome. All woe-begone was that gentil knight To parte from his ladyè; And many a time he sighed sore, And cast a wistfulle eye: Faire Christabelle, from thee to parte, Farre lever had I dye. Faire Christabelle, that ladye bright, Was had forthe of the towre; But ever shee droopeth in her minde, As nipt by an ungentle winde Doth some faire lillye flowre. And ever shee doth lament and weepe To tint her lover soe: Syr Cauline, thou little think'st on mee, But I will still be true. Manye a kinge, and manye a duke, And lords of high degree, Did sue to that fayre ladye of love; But never shee wolde them nee. When manye a daye was past and gone, Ne comforte she colde finde, The kynge proclaimed a tourneament, To cheere his daughters mind: And there came lords, and there came knights, Fro manye a farre countryè, To break a spere for theyr ladyes love Before that faire ladyè. And many a ladye there was sette In purple and in palle: But faire Christabelle soe woe-begone Was the fayrest of them all. Then manye a knighte was mickle of might Before his ladye gaye; But a stranger wight, whom no man knewe, He wan the prize eche daye. His acton it was all of blacke, His hewberke, and his sheelde, Ne noe man wist whence he did come, Ne noe man knewe where he did gone, When they came out the feelde. And now three days were prestlye past In feates of chivalrye, When lo upon the fourth mornìnge A sorrowfulle sight they see. A hugye giaunt stiffe and starke, All foule of limbe and lere; Two goggling eyen like fire farden, A mouthe from eare to eare. Before him came a dwarffe full lowe, That waited on his knee, And at his backe five heads he bare, All wan and pale of blee. Sir, quoth the dwarffe, and louted lowe, Behold that hend Soldàin! Behold these heads I beare with me! They are kings which he hath slain. The Eldridge knìght is his own cousìne, Whom a knight of thine hath shent: And hee is come to avenge his wrong, And to thee, all thy knightes among, Defiance here hath sent. But yette he will appease his wrath Thy daughters love to winne: And but thou yeelde him that fayre mayd, Thy halls and towers must brenne. Thy head, syr king, must goe with mee; Or else thy daughter deere; Or else within these lists soe broad Thou must finde him a peere. The king he turned him round aboute, And in his heart was woe: Is there never a knighte of my round tablè, This matter will undergoe? Is there never a knighte amongst yee all Will fight for my daughter and mee? Whoever will fight yon grimme soldàn, Right fair his meede shall bee. For hee shall have my broad lay-lands, And of my crowne be heyre; And he shall winne fayre Christabelle To be his wedded fere. But every knighte of his round tablè Did stand both still and pale; For whenever they lookt on the grim soldàn, It made their hearts to quail. All woe-begone was that fayre ladyè, When she sawe no helpe was nye: She cast her thought on her owne true-love, And the teares gusht from her eye. Up then sterte the stranger knighte, Sayd, Ladye, be not affrayd: Ile fight for thee with this grimme soldàn, Thoughe he be unmacklye made. And if thou wilt lend me the Eldridge sworde, That lyeth within thy bowre, I truste in Christe for to slay this fiende Thoughe he be stiff in stowre. Goe fetch him downe the Eldridge sworde, The kinge he cryde, with speede: Nowe heaven assist thee, courteous knighte; My daughter is thy meede. The gyaunt he stepped into the lists, And sayd, Awaye, awaye: I sweare, as I am the hend soldàn, Thou lettest me here all daye. Then forthe the stranger knight he came In his blacke armoure dight: The ladye sighed a gentle sighe, “That this were my true knighte!” And nowe the gyaunt and knighte be mett Within the lists soe broad; And now with swordes soe sharpe of steele, They gan to lay on load. The soldan strucke the knighte a stroke, That made him reele asyde; Then woe-begone was that fayre ladyè, And thrice she deeply sighde. The soldan strucke a second stroke, And made the bloude to flowe: All pale and wan was that ladye fayre, And thrice she wept for woe. The soldan strucke a third fell stroke, Which brought the knighte on his knee: Sad sorrow pierced that ladyes heart, And she shriekt loud shriekings three. The knighte he leapt upon his feete, All recklesse of the pain: Quoth hee, But heaven he now my speede, Or else I shall be slaine. He grasped his sworde with mayne and mighte, And spying a secrette part, He drave it into the soldan's syde, And pierced him to the heart. Then all the people gave a shoute, Whan they sawe the soldan falle: The ladye wept, and thanked Christ, That had reskewed her from thrall. And nowe the kinge with all his barons Rose uppe from offe his seate, And downe he stepped intò the listes, That curteous knighte to greete. But he for payne and lacke of bloude Was fallen intò a swounde, And there all walteringe in his gore, Lay lifelesse on the grounde. Come downe, come downe, my daughter deare, Thou art a leeche of skille; Farre lever had I lose halfe my landes, Than this good knighte sholde spille. Downe then steppeth that fayre ladyè, To helpe him if she maye; But when she did his beavere raise, It is my life, my lord, she sayes, And shriekte and swound awaye. Sir Cauline juste lifte up his eyes When he heard his ladye crye, O ladye, I am thine owne true love. For thee I wisht to dye. Then giving her one partinge looke, He closed his eyes in death, Ere Christabelle, that ladye milde, Begane to drawe her breathe. But when she found her comelye knighte Indeed was dead and gone, She layde her pale cold cheeke to his, And thus she made her moane. O staye, my deare and onlye lord, For mee thy faithfulle feere; 'Tis meet that I shold followe thee, Who hast bought my love soe deare. Then fayntinge in a deadlye swoune, And with a deepe-fette sighe, That burst her gentle hearte in twayne, Fayre Christabelle did dye. V. EDWARD, EDWARD. A Scottish Ballad.

This old Romantic Legend, (which is given from two copies, one of them in the Editor's folio MS.) bears marks of great antiquity, and perhaps ought to have taken place of any in this volume. It should seem to have been written while a great part of Spain was in the hands of the Saracens or Moors: whose empire there was not fully extinguished before the year 1491. The Mahometans are spoken of in v. 49, &amp;c. just in the same terms as in all other old romances. The author of the ancient Legend of Sir Bevis represents his hero, upon all occasions, breathing out defiance against “Mahound and Termagaunte See a short Memoir at the end of this ballad, pag. 74. Termagaunt (mentioned above in p. 60.) is the name given in the old romances to the God of the Sarazens: in which he is constantly linked with Mahound or Mahomet. Thus in the legend of syr Guy the Soudan (Sultan) swears, “So helpe me Mahowne of might, “And Termagaunt my God so bright.” Sign. p. iij. b. This word is derived by the very learned Editor of Junius from the Anglo-Saxon [for] very, and [for] mighty. —As this word had so sublime a derivation, and was so applicable to the true God, how shall we account for its being so degraded? Perhaps Termagant had been a name originally given to some Saxon idol, before our ancestors were converted to Christianity; or had been the peculiar attribute of one of their false deities; and therefore the first Christian missionaries rejected it as profane and improper to be applied to the true God. Afterwards when the irruptions of the Saracens into Europe, and the Crusades into the East, had brought them acquainted with a new species of unbelievers; our ignorant ancestors, who thought all that did not receive the Christian law, were necessarily Pagans and Idolaters, supposed the Mahometan creed was in all respects the same with that of their Pagan forefathers, and therefore made no scruple to give the ancient name of Termagant to the God of the Saracens: just in the same manner as they afterwards used the name of Sarazen to express any kind of Pagan or Idolater. In the ancient romance of Merline (in the editor's folio MS.) the Saxons themselves that came over with Hengist, because they were not Christians, are constantly called Sarazens. However that be, it is certain that, after the times of the Crusades, both Mahound and Termagaunt made their frequent appearance in the Pageants and religious Enterludes of the barbarous ages; in which they were exhibited with gestures so furious and frantic, as to become proverbial. Thus Skelton speaks of Wolsey, “Like Mahound in a play, “No man dare him withsay.” Ed. 1736. p. 158. And Bale, describing the threats used by some Papist magistrates to his wife, speaks of them as “grennyng upon her lyke Termagauntes in a playe.” [Actes of Engl. Votaryes, pt. 2. fo. 83. Ed. 1550. 12mo.]—Hence we may conceive the force of Hamlet's expression in Shakespeare, where condemning a ranting player he says, “I could have such a fellow whipt for ore-doing Termagant: it out-Herods Herod.” A. 3. sc. 3.—By degrees the word came to be applied to an outrageous turbulent person, and especially to a violent brawling woman; to whom alone it is now confined: and this the rather as, I suppose, the character of Termagant was anciently represented on the stage after the eastern mode, with long robes or petticoats. Another frequent character in the old pageants or enterludes of our ancestors, was the sowdan or soldan representing a grim eastern tyrant: This appears from a curious passage in Stow's Annals [p. 458.]—In a stage-play “the people know right well that he that plaieth the sowdain, is percase a sowter [shoe-maker], yet if one should cal him by his owne name, while he standeth in his majestie, one of his tormentors might bap to break his head.” The sowdain or soldan, was a name given to any Sarazen king, (being only a more rude pronunciation of the word sultan) as the soldan of Egypt, the soudan of Persia, the sowdan of Babylon, &amp;c. who were generally represented as accompanied with grim Sarazens, whose business it was to punish and torment Christians. I cannot conclude this short Memoir, without observing that the French romancers who had borrowed the word Termagant from us, and applied it as we in their old romances, corrupted it into Tervagaunte: And from them La Fontaine took it up, and has used it more than once in his tales.—This may be added to the other proofs adduced in these volumes of the great intercourse that formerly subsisted between the old minstrels and legendary writers of both nations, and that they mutually borrowed each others romances.;” And so full of zeal for his religion, as to return the following polite message to a Paynim king's fair daughter, who had fallen in love with him, and sent two Saraecn knights to invite him to her bower, “I wyll not ones stirre off this grounde, “To speake with an heathen hounde, “Unchristen houndes, I rede you fie, “Or I your harte bloud shall se Sign. C. ij. b..” Indeed they return the compliment by calling him elswhere “A christen hounde. Sign. C. j. b.” This was conformable to the real manners of the barbarous ages: perhaps the same excuse will hardly serve our bard for the situations in which he has placed some of his royal personages. That a youthful monarch should take a journey into another kingdom to visit his mistress incog. was a piece of gallantry paralleled in our own Charles I. but that king Adland should be found lolling or leaning at his gate (v. 35.) may be thought perchance a little out of character. And yet the great painter of manners, Homer, did not think it inconsistent with decorum to represent a king of the Taphians rearing himself at the gate of Ulysses to inquire for that monarch, when he touched at Ithaca as he was taking a voyage with a ship's cargo of iron to dispose in traffic Odyss. a. 105.. So little ought we to judge of ancient manners by our own. Before I conclude this article, I cannot help observing that the reader will see in this ballad, the character of the old Minstrels (those successors of the bards) placed in a very respectable light See vol. 2. p. 168.: here he will see one of them represented mounted on a fine horse, accompanied with an attendant to bear his harp after him, and to sing the poems of his composing. Here he will see him mixing in the company of kings without ceremony: no mean proof of the great antiquity of this poem. The farther we carry our inquiries back, the greater respect we find paid to the professors of poetry and music among all the Celtic and Gothic nations. Their character was deemed so sacred, that under its sanction our famous king Alfred (as we have already seen See the Essay on the ancient Minstrels prefixed to this Vol.) made no scruple to enter the Danish camp, and was at once admitted to the king's head-quarters Even so late as the time of Froissart, we find Minstrels and Heralds mentioned together, as those who might securely go into an enemy's country. Cap. cxl.. Our poet has suggested the same expedient to the heroes of this ballad. All the histories of the North are full of the great reverence paid to this order of men. Harold Harfagre, a celebrated king of Norway, was wont to seat them at his table above all the officers of his court: and we find another Norwegian king placing five of them by his side in a day of battle, that they might be eye-witnesses of the great exploits they were to celebrate Bartholini Antiq.

II. in the Essay on the Minstrels. Hearken to me, gentlemen, Come and you shall heare; Ile tell you of two of the boldest brethren, That ever born y-were. The tone of them was Adler yonge, The tother was kyng Estmere; The were as bolde men in their deedes, As any were farr and neare. As they were drinking ale and wine Within kyng Estmeres halle: When will ye marry a wyfe, brothèr, A wyfe to gladd us all? Then bespake him kyng Estmere, And answered him hastilee: I knowe not that ladye in any lande, That is able He means fit, suitable. to marry with mee. Kyng Adland hath a daughter, brother, Men call her bright and sheene; If I were kyng here in your stead, That ladye sholde be queene. Sayes, Reade me, reade me, deare brother, Throughout merrye Englànd, Where we might find a messenger Betweene us two to sende. Sayes, You shal ryde yourselfe, brothèr, Ile beare you companèe; Many throughe fals messengers are deceivde, And I feare lest soe shold wee. Thus the renisht them to ryde Of twoe good renisht steedes, And when they came to king Adlands halle, Of red golde shone their weedes. And whan the came to kyng Adlands halle Before the goodlye yate, Ther they found good kyng Adlànd Rearing himselfe theratt. Nowe Christ thee save, good king Adlànd; Nowe Christ thee save and see. Sayd, You be welcome, king Estmere, Right hartilye unto mee. You have a daughter, sayd Adler yonge, Men call her bright and sheene, My brother wold marrye her to his wiffe, Of Englande to be queene. Yesterdaye was at my deare daughtèr Syr Bremor the kyng of Spayne; And then she nicked him of naye, I feare sheele do youe the same. The kyng of Spayne is a foule paynìm, And 'leeveth on Mahound; And pitye it were that fayre ladyè Shold marrye a heathen hound. But grant to me, sayes kyng Estmere, For my love I you praye; That I may see your daughter deare Before I goe hence awaye. Althoughe itt is seven yeare and more Syth my daughter was in halle, She shall come downe once for your sake To glad my guestès alle. Downe then came that mayden fayre, With ladyes lacede in pall, And halfe a hondred of bolde knightes, To bring her from bowre to hall; And eke as manye gentle squieres, To waite upon them all. The talents of golde, were on her head sette, Hunge lowe downe to her knee; And everye rynge on her smalle fingèr, Shone of the chrystall free. Sayes, Christ you save, my deare madàme; Sayes, Christ you save and see. Sayes, You be welcome, kyng Estmere, Right welcome unto mee. And iff you love me, as you saye, So well, and hartilèe, All that ever you are comen about Soone sped now itt may bee. Then bespake her father deare: My daughter, I saye naye; Remember well the kyng of Spayne, What he sayd yesterdaye. He wold pull downe my halles and castles, And reave me of my lyfe: And ever I feare that paynim kyng, Iff I reave him of his wyfe. Your castles and your towres, father, Are stronglye built aboute; And therefore of that foule paynìm Wee neede not stande in doubte. Plyght me your troth, nowe, kyng Estmère, By heaven and your righte hand, That you will marrye me to your wyfe, And make me queene of your land. Then kyng Estmere he plight his troth By heaven and his righte hand, That he wolde marrye her to his wyfe, And make her queene of his land. And he tooke leave of that ladye fayre, To goe to his owne countree, To fetche him dukes and lordes and knightes, That marryed the might bee. They had not ridden scant a myle, A myle forthe of the towne, But in did come the kyng of Spayne, With kempès many a one. But in did come the kyng of Spayne, With manye a grimme baròne, Tone day to marrye kyng Adlands daughter, Tother daye to carrye her home. Then shee sent after kyng Estmère In all the spede might bee, That he must either returne and fighte, Or goe home and lose his ladyè. One whyle then the page he went, Another whyle he ranne; Till he had oretaken king Estmere, I wis, he never blanne. Tydinges, tydinges, kyng Estmere! What tydinges nowe, my boye? O tydinges I can tell to you, That will you sore annoye. You had not ridden scant a myle, A myle out of the towne, But in did come the kyng of Spayne With kempès many a one: But in did come the kyng of Spayne With manye a grimme baròne, Tone daye to marrye king Adlands daughter, Tother daye to carrye her home. That ladye fayre she greetes you well, And ever-more well by mee: You must either turne againe and fighte, Or goe home and lose your ladyè. Sayes, Reade me, reade me, deare brothèr, My reade shall ryde sic. MS. at thee, Whiche waye we best may turne and fighte, To save this fayre ladyè. Now hearken to me, sayes Adler yonge, And your reade must rise sic. MS. at me, I quicklye will devise a waye To sette thy ladye free. My mother was a westerne woman, And learned in gramaryè The word Gramayre occurs several times in the foregoing poem, and every where seems to signify Magic or some kind of supernatural science. I know not whence to derive it, unless it be from the word Grammar.—In those dark and ignorant ages, when it was thought a high degree of learning to be able to read and write; he who had made a little further progress in literature, might well pass for a conjurer or magician. And when I learned at the schole, Something shee taught itt mee. There groweth an hearbe within this fielde, And iff it were but knowne, His color, which is whyte and redd, It will make blacke and browne: His color, which is browne and blacke, Itt will make redd and whyte; That sworde is not in all Englande, Upon his coate will byte. And you shal be a harper, brother, Out of the north countrèe; And Ile be your boye, so faine of fighte, To beare your harpe by your knee. And you shall be the best harpèr, That ever tooke harpe in hand; And I will be the best singèr, That ever sung in this land. Itt shal be written in our forheads All and in grammaryè, That we towe are the boldest men, That are in all Christentyè. And thus they renisht them to ryde, On towe good renish steedes; And whan they came to king Adlands hall, Of redd gold shone their weedes. And whan the came to kyng Adlands hall Untill the fayre hall yate, There they found a proud portèr Rearing himselfe theratt. Sayes, Christ thee save, thou proud portèr; Sayes, Christ thee save and see. Nowe you be welcome, sayd the portèr, Of what land soever ye bee. We been harpers, sayd Adler yonge, Come out of the northe countrèe; We beene come hither untill this place, This proud weddinge for to see. Sayd, And your color were white and redd, As it is blacke and browne, Ild saye king Estmere and his brother Were comen untill this towne. Then they pulled out a ryng of gold, Layd itt on the porters arme: And ever we will thee, proud portèr, Thow wilt saye us no harme. Sore he looked on kyng Estmère, And sore he handled the ryng, Then opened to them the fayre hall yates, He lett for no kind of thyng. Kyng Estmere he light off his steede Up att the fayre hall board; The frothe, that came from his brydle bitte, Light on kyng Bremors beard. Sayes, Stable thy steede, thou proud harpèr, Goe stable him in the stalle; Itt doth not beseeme a proud harpèr To stable him in a kyngs halle. My ladd he is so lither, he sayd, He will do nought that's meete; And aye that I cold but find the man, Were able him to beate. Thou speakst proud words, sayd the Paynim king, Thou harper here to mee; There is a man within this halle, That will beate thy lad and thee. O lett that man come downe, he sayd, A sight of him wold I see; And whan hee hath beaten well my ladd, Then he shall beate of mee. Downe then came the kemperye man, And looked him in the eare; For all the gold, that was under heaven, He durst not neigh him neare. And how nowe, kempe, sayd the kyng of Spayne, And how what aileth thee? He sayes, Itt is written in his forhead All and in gramaryè, That for all the gold that is under heaven, I dare not neigh him nye. Kyng Estmere then pulled forth his harpe, And playd thereon so sweete: Upstarte the ladye from the kynge, As hee sate at the meate. Now stay thy harpe, thou proud harpèr, Now stay thy harpe, I say; For an thou playest as thou beginnest, Thou'lt till i. e. Entice. Vid. Gloss. For Gramary, see below. my bride awaye. He strucke upon his harpe agayne, And playd both fayre and free; The ladye was so pleasde theratt, She laught loud laughters three. Nowe sell me thy harpe, sayd the kyng of Spayne, Thy harpe and stryngs eche one, And as many gold nobles thou shalt have, As there be stryngs thereon. And what wold ye doe with my harpe, he sayd, Iff I did sell it yee? “To playe my wiffe and me a fitt i. e. a tune, or strain of music. See Gloss., When abed together we bee.” Now sell me, quoth hee, thy bryde soe gay, As shee sitts laced in pall, And as many gold nobles I will give, As there be rings in the hall. And what wold ye doe with my bryde soe gay, Iff I did sell her yee? More seemelye it is for her fayre bodye To lye by mee than thee. Hee played agayne both loud and shrille, And Adler he did syng, “O ladye, this is thy owne true love; “Noe harper, but a kyng. “O ladye, this is thy owne true love, “As playnlye thou mayest see; “And Ile rid thee of that foule paynìm, “Who partes thy love and thee.” The ladye looked, the ladye blushte, And blushte and lookt agayne, While Adler he hath drawne his brande, And hath the Sowdan slayne. Up then rose the kemperye men, And loud they gan to crye: Ah! traytors, yee have slayne our kyng, And therefore yee shall dye. Kyng Estmere threwe the harpe asyde, And swith he drew his brand; And Estmere he, and Adler yonge Right stiffe in stour can stand. And aye their swordes soe sore can byte, Throughe help of Gramaryè That soone they have slayne the kempery men, Or forst them forth to flee. Kyng Estmere tooke that fayre ladyè, And marryed her to his wyfe, And brought her home to merrye Englànd With her to leade his lyfe. VII. SIR PATRICK SPENCE, A Scottish Ballad —is given from two MS copies transmitted from Scotland. In what age the hero of this ballad lived, or when this fatal expedition happened that proved so destructive to the Scots nobles, I have not been able to discover; yet am of opinion that their catastrophe is not altogether without foundation in history, though it has escaped my own researches. In the infancy of navigation, such as used the northern seas, were very liable to shipwreck in the wintry months: hence a law was enacted in the reign of James the III, (a law which was frequently repeated afterwards) “That there be na schip frauched out of the realm with any staple gudes, fra the feast of Simons day and Jude, unto the feast of the purification our Lady called Candelmess.” Jam. III. Parlt. 2. Ch. 15. In some modern copies, instead of Patrick Spence hath been substituted the name of Sir Andrew Wood, a famous Scottish admiral who flourished in the time of our Edw. IV. but whose story hath nothing in common with this of the ballad. As Wood was the most noted warrior of Scotland, it is probable that, like the Theban Hercules, he hath engrossed the renown of other heroes. The king sits in Dumferling toune, Drinking the blude-reid wine: O quhar will I get guid sailòr, To sail this schip of mine? Up and spak an eldern knicht, Sat at the kings richt kne: Sir Patrick Spence is the best sailòr, That sails upon the se. The king has written a braid letter, And signd it wi' his hand; And sent it to Sir Patrick Spence, Was walking on the sand. The first line that Sir Patrick red, A loud lauch lauched he: The next line that Sir Patrick red, The teir blinded his ee. O quha is this has don this deid, This ill deid don to me; To send me out this time o'the zeir, To sail upon the se? Mak hast, mak haste, my mirry men all, Our guid schip sails the morne. O say na sae, my master deir, For I feir a deadlie storme. Late late yestreen I saw the new moone Wi' the auld moone in hir arme; And I feir, I feir, my deir mastèr, That we will com to harme. O our Scots nobles wer richt laith To weet their cork-heild schoone; Bot lang owre a' the play wer playd, Thair hats they swam aboone. O lang, lang, may thair ladies sit Wi' thair fans into their hand, Or eir they se Sir Patrick Spence Cum sailing to the land. O lang, lang, may the ladies stand Wi' thair gold kems in their hair, Waiting for thair ain deir lords, For they'll se thame na mair. Have owre, have owre to Aberdour A village lying upon the river Forth, the entrance to which is sometimes denominated De mortuo mari., It's fiftie fadom deip: And thair lies guid Sir Patrick Spence, Wi' the Scots lords at his feit. VIII. ROBIN HOOD AND GUY OF GISBORNE. We have here a ballad of Robin Hood (from the Editor's folio MS) which was never before printed, and carries marks of much greater antiquity than any of the common popular songs on this subject. The severity of those tyrannical forest-laws, that were introduced by our Norman kings, and the great temptation of breaking them by such as lived near the royal forests, at a time when the yeomanry of this kingdom were every where trained up to the long-bow, and excelled all other nations in the art of shooting, must constantly have occasioned great numbers of outlaws, and especially of such as were the best marksmen. These naturally fled to the woods for shelter, and forming into troops, endeavoured by their numbers to protect themselves from the dreadful penalties of their delinquency. The ancient punishment for killing the king's deer, was loss of eyes and castration: a punishment far worse than death. This will easily account for the troops of banditti, which formerly lurked in the royal forests, and from their superior skill in archery and knowledge of all the recesses of those unfrequented solitudes, found it no difficult matter to resist or elude the civil power. Among all these, none was ever more famous than the hero of this ballad: the heads of whose story, as collected by Stow, are briefly these. “In this time [about the year 1190, in the reign of Richard I.] were many robbers, and outlawes, among the which Robin Hood, and Little John, renowned theeves, continued in woods, despoyling and robbing the goods of the rich. They killed none but such as would invade them; or by resistance for their own defence. “The saide Robert entertained an hundred tall men and good archers with such spoiles and thefts as he got, upon whom four hundred (were they ever so strong) durst not give the onset. He suffered no woman to be oppressed, violated, or otherwise molested: poore mens goods he spared, abundantlie relieving them with that, which by theft he got from abbeys and the houses of rich carles: whom Maior (the historian) blameth for his rapine and theft, but of all theeves he affirmeth him to be the prince and the most gentle theefe.” Annals, p. 159. The personal courage of this celebrated outlaw, his skill in archery, his humanity, and especially his levelling principle of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, have in all ages rendered him the favourite of the common people: who not content to celebrate his memory by innumerable songs and stories, have erected him into the dignity of an earl. Indeed it is not impossible, but our hero, to gain the more respect from his followers, or they to derive the more credit to their profession, may have given rise to such a report themselves: for we find it recorded in an epitaph, which, if genuine, must have been inscribed on his tombstone near the nunnery of Kirk-lees in Yorkshire; where (as the story goes) he was bled to death by a treacherous nun to whom he applied for phlebotomy. See Thoresby's Ducat. Leod. p. 576. Biog. Brit. VI. 3933. Hear undernead dis lait ? stean laiz robert earl of huntingtun nea arcir ver az hie sae geud an pipl kauld im Robin Heud sick utlawz as hi an is men vil England nivir si agen. obiit 24 kal. dekembris, 1247. This Epitaph appears to me suspicious; however, a late Antiquary has given a pedigree of Robin Hood, which, if genuine, shews that he had real pretensions to the Earldom of Huntington, and that his true name was Robert Fitz-ooth Stukeley, in his Palæographia Britannica, No. II. 1746.. Yet the most ancient poems on Robin Hood make no mention of this Earldom. He is expressly asserted to have been a yeoman See also the following ballad, v. 147. in a very old legend in verse preserved in the archives of the public library at Cambridge Num. D. 5. 2. in eight fyttes or Parts, printed in black letter, quarto, thus inscribed, “Here begynneth a lytell geste of Robyn hode and his meyne, and of the proude sheryfe of Notyngham.” The first lines are, “Lithe and lysten, gentylmen, “That be of fre bore blode: “I shall you tell of a good yeman, “His name was Robyn hode. “Robyn was a proude out-lawe, “Whiles he walked on grounde; “So curteyse an outlawe as he was one, “Was never none yfounde.” &amp;c. The printer's colophon is, “Explicit Kinge Edwarde and Robin hode and Lyttel Johan. Enprented at London in Fletestrete at the sygne of the sone by Wynkin de Worde.” —In Mr. Garrick's Collection Old Plays, 4 to. K. vol. 10. is a different edition of the same poem “Imprinted at London upon the thre Crane wharfe by Wyllyam Copland.” containing at the end a little dramatic piece on the subject of Robin Hood and the Friar, not found in the former copy, called, “A newe playe for to be played in Maye games very plesaunte and full of pastyme.” I shall conclude these preliminary remarks with observing, that the hero of this ballad was the favourite subject of popular songs so early as the time of K. Edw. III. In the Visions of Pierce Plowman, written in that reign, a monk says, I can rimes of Roben Hod, and Randal of Chester, But of our Lorde and our Lady, I lerne nothyng at all. Fol. 26. Ed. 1550. See also in Bp. Latimer's Sermons Ser. 6th before K. Ed. Apr. 12. fol. 75. Gilpin's life of Lat. p. 122. a very curious and characteristical story, which shews what respect was shewn to the memory of our archer in the time of that prelate. Whan shaws beene sheene, and shraddes It should perhaps be Swards: i.e. the surface of the ground: viz. “when the fields are in their beauty.” full fayre, And leaves both large and longe, Itt's merrye walkyng in the fayre forrèst To heare the small birdes songe. The woodweele sang, and wold not cease, Sitting upon the spraye, Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood, In the greenwood where he lay. Now by my faye, sayd jollye Robìn, A sweaven I had this night; I dreamt me of tow wighty yemen, That fast with me can fight. Methought they did me beate and binde, And tooke my bowe me froe; Iff I be Robin alive in this lande, Ile be wroken on them towe. Sweavens are swift, sayd Lyttle John, As the wind blowes over the hill; For iff itt be never so loude this night, To-morrow it may be still. Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all, And John shall goe with mee, For Ile goe seeke yond wighty yeomen, In greenwood where they bee. Then they cast on theyr gownes of grene, And tooke theyr bowes each one; And they away to the greene forrèst A shooting forth are gone; Untill they came to the merry greenwood, Where they had gladdest to bee, There they were ware of a wight yeomàn, That leaned agaynst a tree. A sword and a dagger he wore by his side, Of manye a man the bane; And he was clad in his capull hyde Topp and tayll and mayne. Stand still, master, quoth Litle John, Under this tree so grene, And I will go to yond wight yeoman To know what he doth meane. Ah! John, by me thou settest noe store, And that I farley finde: How often send I my men before, And tarry my selfe behinde? It is no cunning a knave to ken, And a man but heare him speake; And it were not for bursting of my bowe, John, I thy head wold breake. As often wordes they breeden bale, So they parted Robin and John; And John is gone to Barnesdale: The gates i.e. ways, passes, paths, ridings. Gate is a common word in the North for way. he knoweth eche one. But when he came to Barnesdale, Great heavinesse there hee hadd, For he found tow of his owne fellòwes Were slaine both in a slade. A Scarlette he was flyinge a-foote Fast over stocke and stone, For the proud sheriffe with seven score men Fast after him is gone. One shoote now I will shoote, quoth John, With Christ his might and mayne; Ile make yond sheriffe that wends soe fast, To stopp he shall be fayne. Then John bent up his long bende-bowe, And fetteled him to shoote: The bow was made of tender boughe, And fell downe at his foote. Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood, That ever thou grew on a tree; For now this day thou art my bale, My boote when thou shold bee. His shoote it was but loosely shott, Yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine, For itt mett one of the sherriffes men, And William a Trent was slaine. It had bene better of William a Trent To have bene abed with sorrowe, Than to be that day in the green wood slade To meet with Little Johns arrowe. But as it is said, when men be mett Fyve can doe more than three, The sheriffe hath taken little John, And bound him fast to a tree. Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe, And hanged hye on a hill. But thou mayst fayle of thy purpose, quoth John, If it be Christ his will. Lett us leave talking of little John, And thinke of Robin Hood, How he is gone to the wight yeomàn, Where under the leaves he stood. Good morrowe, good fellowe, sayd Robin so fayre, “Good morrowe, good fellow, quo' he:” Methinkes by this bowe thou beares in thy hande A good archere thou sholdst bee. I am wilfulle of my waye, quo' the yeman, And of my morning tyde. Ile lead thee through the wood, sayd Robin; Good fellow, Ile be thy guide. I seeke an outlàwe, the straunger sayd, Men call him Robin Hood; Rather Ild meet with that proud outlàwe Than fortye pound soe good. Now come with me, thou wighty yeman, And Robin thou soone shalt see: But first let us some pastime find Under the greenwood tree. First let us some masterye make Among the woods so even, We may chance to meete with Robin Hood Here at some unsett steven. They cutt them down two summer shroggs, That grew both under a breere, And sett them threescore rood in twaine To shoote the prickes y-fere. Leade on, good fellowe, quoth Robin Hood, Leade on, I do bidd thee. Nay by my faith, good fellowe, hee sayd, My leader thou shalt bee. The first time Robin shot at the pricke, He mist but an inch it fro: The yeoman he was an archer good, But he cold never do soe. The second shoote had the wightye yeman, He shot within the garlànd: But Robin he shott far better than hee, For he clave the good pricke wande. A blessing upon thy heart, he sayd; Good fellowe, thy shooting is goode; For an thy hart be as good as thy hand, Thou wert better than Robin Hoode. Now tell me thy name, good fellowe, sayd he, Under the leaves of lyne. Nay by my faith, quoth bolde Robìn, Till thou have told me thine. I dwell by dale and downe, quoth hee, And Robin to take Ime sworne; And when I am called by my right name I am Guy of good Gisbòrne. My dwelling is in this wood, sayes Robin, By thee I set right nought: I am Robin Hood of Barnèsdale, Whom thou so long hast sought. He that had neyther beene kithe nor kin, Might have seen a full fayre sight, To see how together these yeomen went With blades both browne The common epithet for a sword or other offensive weapon, in the old metrical romances, is Brown. As “brown brand,” or “brown sword: brown bill,” &amp;c. and sometimes even “bright brown sword.” Chaucer applies the word rustie in the same sense; thus he describes the reve: And by his side he bare a rustie blade.” Prol. ver. 620. And even thus the God Mars: “And in his hand he had a rousty sword.” Test. of Cressid. 188. Spencer has sometimes used the same epithet: See Warten's Observ. vol. 2. p. 62. It should seem from this particularity that our ancestors did not pique themselves upon keeping their weapons bright: perhaps they deemed it more honourable to carry them stained with the blood of their enemies. and bright. To see how these yeomen together they fought Two howres of a summers day: Yett neither Robin Hood nor sir Guy Them fettled to flye away. Robin was reachles on a roote, And stumbled at that tyde; And Guy was quicke and nimble with-all, And hitt him upon the syde. Ah deere Ladye, sayd Robin Hood tho, That art but mother and may', I think it was never mans destinye To dye before his day. Robin thought on our ladye deere, And soone leapt up againe, And strait he came with a ‘backward’ stroke, awkwarde. MS. And he sir Guy hath slayne. He took sir Guys head by the hayre, And stuck it upon his bowes end: Thou hast beene a traytor all thy life, Which thing must have an end. Robin pulled forth an Irish knife, And nicked sir Guy in the face, That he was never on woman born, Cold know whose head it was. Sayes, Lye there, lye there, now sir Guye, And with me be not wrothe; Iff thou have had the worst strokes at my hand, Thou shalt have the better clothe. Robin did off his gowne of greene, And on sir Guy did throwe, And hee put on that capull hyde, That cladd him topp to toe. Thy bowe, thy arrowes, and litle horne, Now with me I will beare; For I will away to Barnèsdale, To see how my men doe fare. Robin Hood sett Guyes horne to his mouth, And a loud blast in it did blow. That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham, As he leaned under a lowe. Hearken, hearken, sayd the sheriffe, I heare nowe tydings good, For yonder I heare sir Guyes horne blow, And he hath slaine Robin Hoode. Yonder I heare sir Guyes horne blowe, Itt blowes soe well in tyde, And yonder comes that wightye yeoman, Cladd in his capull hyde. Come hyther, come hyther, thou good sir Guy, Aske what thou wilt of mee. O I will none of thy gold, sayd Robin, Nor I will none of thy fee: But now I have slaine the master, he sayes, Let me goe strike the knave; For this is all the meede I aske; None other rewarde I'le have. Thou art a madman, sayd the sheriffe, Thou sholdst have had a knightes fee: But seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad, Well granted it shal bee. When Little John heard his master speake, Well knewe he it was his steven: Now shall I be looset, quoth Little John, With Christ his might in heaven. Fast Robin hee hyed him to Little John, He thought to loose him blive; The sheriffe and all his companye Fast after him can drive. Stand abacke, stand abacke, sayd Robin; Why draw you mee so neere? Itt was never the use in our countryè, Ones shrift another shold heere. But Robin pulled forth an Irysh knife, And losed John hand and foote, And gave him sir Guyes bow into his hand, And bade it be his boote. Then John he took Guyes bow in his hand, His boltes and arrowes eche one: When the sheriffe saw Little John bend his bow, He fettled him to be gone. Towards his house in Nottingham towne, He fled full fast away; And soe did all the companye; Not one behind wold stay. But he cold neither runne soe fast, Nor away soe fast cold ryde, But Little John with an arrowe soe broad, He shott him into the ‘backe’-syde. The title of Sir was not formerly peculiar to Knights, it was given to priests, and sometimes to very inferior personages. IX. AN ELEGY ON HENRY FOURTH EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND. The subject of this poem, which was written by Skelton, is the death of Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland, who fell a victim to the avarice of Henry VII. In 1489 the parliament had granted the king a subsidy for carrying on the war in Bretagne. This tax was found so heavy in the North, that the whole country was in a flame. The E. of Northumberland, then lord lieutenant for Yorkshire, wrote to inform the king of the discontent, and praying an abatement. But nothing is so unrelenting as avarice: the king wrote back that not a penny should be abated. This message being delivered by the earl with too little caution, the populace rose, and supposing him to be the promoter of their calamity, broke into his house, and murdered him with several of his attendants: who yet are charged by Skelton with being backward in their duty on this occasion. This melancholy event happened at the earl's seat at Cocklodge, near Thirske, in Yorkshire, April 28. 1489. See Lord Bacon, &amp;c. If the reader does not find much poetical merit in this old poem (which yet is one of Skelton's best), he will see a striking picture of the state and magnificence kept up by our ancient nobility during the feudal times. This great earl is described here as having among his menial servants, knights, squires, and even barons: see v. 32. 183. &amp;c. Which however different from modern manners, was formerly not unusual with our greater Barons, whose castles had all the splendour and offices of a royal court, before the Laws against Retainers abridged and limited the number of their attendants. John Skelton, who commonly styled himself Poet Laureat, died June 21. 1529. The following poem, which appears to have been written soon after the event, is printed from an ancient MS. copy preserved in the British Museum, being much more correct than that printed among Skelton's Poems in bl. let. 12mo. 1568.—It is addressed to Henry Percy fifth earl of Northumberland, and is prefacea, &amp;c. in the following manner: Poeta Skelton Laureatus libellum suum metrice alloquitur. Ad dominum properato meum mea pagina Percy, Qui Northumbrorum jura paterna gerit. Ad nutum celebris tu prona repone leonis, Quæque suo patri tristia justa cano. Ast ubi perlegit, dubiam sub mente volutet Fortunam, cuncta quæ male fida rotat. Qui leo sit felix, &amp; Nestoris occupet annos; Ad libitum cujus ipse paratus ero. Skelton Laureat upon the dolorus dethe and much lamentable chaunce of the moost honorable Erle of Northumberlande. I wayle, I wepe, I sobbe, I sigh ful sore The dedely fate, the dolefulle destenny Of him that is gone, alas! withoute restore, Of the blode Henry, first E. of Northumberland, was born of Mary daughter to Henry E. of Lancaster, second son of K. Henry III.—He was also lineally descended from the Emperour Charlemagne and the ancient Kings of France, by his ancestor Josceline de Lovain, (son of Godfrey Duke of Brabant,) who took the name of Percy on marrying the heiress of that house in the reign of Hen.

It may be registerde of shamefull recorde. So noble a man, so valiaunt lorde and knight, Fulfilled with honor, as all the worlde dothe ken; At his commaundement, whiche had both day and night Knyghtis and squyers, at every season when He calde upon them, as menyall houshold men: Were no thes commones uncurteis karlis of kynde To slo their owne lorde? God was not in their minde. And were not they to blame, I say also, That were aboute hym, his owne servants of trust, To suffre hym slayn of his mortall fo? Fled away from hym, let hym ly in the dust: They bode not till the rekening were discust. What shuld I flatter? what shulde I glose or paynt? Fy, fy for shame, their harts wer to faint. In Englande and Fraunce, which gretly was redouted; Of whom both Flaunders and Scotland stode in drede; To whome grete astates obeyde and lowttede; A mayny of rude villayns made him for to blede: Unkindly they slew hym, that holp them oft at nede: He was their bulwark, their paves, and their wall, Yet shamfully they slew hym; that shame mot them befal. I say, ye comoners, why wer ye so stark mad? What frantyk frensy syll in youre brayne? Where was your wit and reson, ye shuld have had? What willfull foly made yow to ryse agayne Your naturall lord? alas! I can not fayne. Ye armed you with will, and left your wit behynd; Well may you be called comones most unkynd. He was your chyfteyne, your shelde, your chef defence, Redy to assyst you in every tyme of nede: Your worship depended of his excellence: Alas! ye mad men, to far ye did excede: Your hap was unhappy, to ill was your spede: What movyd you agayn hym to war or to fight? What aylde you to sle your lord agyn all right? The grounde of his quarel was for his sovereyn lord, The welle concernyng of all the hole lande, Demaundyng soche dutyes as nedis most acord To the right of his prince which shold not be withstand; For whos cause ye slew hym with your awne hande: But had his nobill men done wel that day, Ye had not been hable to have saide him nay. But ther was fals packinge, or els I am begylde: How-be-it the mater was evident and playne, For yf they had occupied ther spere and ther shelde, This noble man doutles had not be slayne. Bot men say they wer lynked with a double chayn, And held with the commouns under a cloke, Whiche kindeled the wyld fyre that made all this smoke. The commouns renyed ther taxes to pay Of them demaunded and asked by the kynge; With one voice importune, they playnly said nay: They buskt them on a bushment themself in baile to bringe: Agayne the kings plesure to wrastle or to wringe, Bluntly as bestis withe boste and with cry They saide, they forsede not, nor carede not to dy. The noblenes of the northe this valiant lorde and knyght, As man that was innocent of trechery or trayne, Presed forthe boldly to witstand the myght, And, lyke marciall Hector, he fauht them agayne, Vigorously upon them with myght and with mayne, Trustinge in noble men that wer with hym there: Bot all they fled from hym for falshode or fere. Barons, knights, squyers, one and alle, Togeder with servaunts of his famuly, Turnd their backis, and let ther master fall, Of whos [life] they counted not a flye; Take up whos wolde for them, they let hym ly. Alas! his golde, his fee, his annuall rente Upon suche a sort was ille bestowde and spent. He was envyronde aboute on every syde Withe his enemys, that were stark mad and wode; Yet whils he stode he gave them woundes wyde: Alas for routhe! what thouche his mynde were goode, His corage manly, yet ther he shed his bloode! All left alone, alas! he fawte in vayne; For cruelly amonge them ther he was slayne. Alas for pite! that Percy thus was spylt, The famous erle of Northumberlande: Of knightly prowès the sworde pomel and hylt, The myghty lyoun doutted by se and lande! O dolorous chaunce of fortuns fruward hande! What man remembring how shamfully he was slayne, From bitter weepinge hymself kan restrayne? O cruell Mars, thou dedly god of war! O dolorous teusday, dedicate to thy name, When thou shoke thy sworde so noble a man to mar! O grounde ungracious, unhappy be thy fame, Whiche wert endyed with rede blode of the same! Moste noble erle! O fowle mysuryd grounde Whereon he gat his fynal dedely wounde! O Atropos, of the fatall systers thre, Goddes mooste cruell unto the lyf of man, All merciles, in the ys no pitè! O homycide, whiche sleest all that thou kan, So forcibly upon this erle thow ran, That with thy sworde enharpid of mortall drede, Thou kit asonder his persight vitall threde! My wordis unpullysht be nakide and playne, Of aureat poems they want ellumynynge; Bot by them to knoulege ye may attayne Of this lordis dethe and of his murdrynge. Which whils he lyvyd had fuyson of every thing, Of knights, of squyers, chef lord of toure and toune, Tyl fykkill fortune began on hym to frowne. Paregall to dukis, with kings he myght compare, Sourmountinge in honor all erls he did excede, To all cuntreis aboute hym reporte me I dare. Lyke to Eneas benygne in worde and dede, Valiaunt as Hector in every marciall nede, Provydent, discrete, circumspect, and wyse, Tyll the chaunce ran agyne him of fortunes duble dyse. What nedethe me for to extoll his fame With my rude pen enkankerd all with rust? Whos noble actis shew worsheply his name, Transcendyng far myne homely muse, that must Yet sumwhat wright supprisid with hartly lust, Truly reportinge his right noble astate, Immortally whiche is immaculate. His noble blode never disteynyd was, Trew to his prince for to defende his right, Doublenes hatinge, fals maters to compas, Treytory and treson he bannesht out of syght, With trowth to medle was all his hole delyght, As all his kuntrey kan testefy the same: To slo suche a lord, alas, it was grete shame. If the hole quere of the musis nyne In me all onely wer sett and comprisyde, Enbrethed with the blast of influence dyvyne, As perfightly as could be thought or devysyd; To me also allthouche it were promysyde Of laureat Phebus holy the eloquence, All were to litill for his magnyficence. O yonge lyon, bot tender yet of age, Grow and encrese, remembre thyn astate, God the assyst unto thyn herytage, And geve the grace to be more fortunate, Agayne rebellyouns arme to make debate. And, as the lyoune, whiche is of bestis kinge, Unto thy subjectis be kurteis and benyngne. I pray God sende the prosperous lyf and long, Stabille thy mynde constant to be and fast, Right to mayntein, and to resist all wronge, All flattringe faytors abhor and from the cast, Of foule detraction God kepe the from the blast, Let double delinge in the have no place, And be not light of credence in no case.

O quene of mercy, O lady full of grace, Maiden moste pure, and goddis moder dere, To sorowfull harts chef comfort and solace, Of all women O floure withouten pere, Pray to thy son above the starris clere, He to vouchesaf by thy mediatioun To pardon thy servant, and bringe to salvacion. In joy triumphaunt the hevenly yerarchy, With all the hole sorte of that glorious place, His soule mot receyve into ther company Thorowe bounte of hym that formed all solace: Well of pite, of mercy, and of grace, The father, the son, and the holy goste In Trinitate one God of myghts moste. I have placed the foregoing poem of Skelton's before the following extract from Hawes, not only because it was written first, but because I think Skelton is in general to be considered as the earlier poet; many of his poems being written long before Hawes's Graunde Amour. X. THE TOWER OF DOCTRINE. The reader has here a specimen of the descriptive powers of Stephen Hawes, a celebrated poet in the reign of Hen. VII. tho' now little known. It is extracted from an allegorical poem of his (written in 1505.) intitled, “The Hist. of Graunde Amoure &amp; La Belle Pucel, called the Palace of Pleasure, &amp;c.” 4to. 1555. See more of Hawes in Ath. Ox. v. 1. p. 6. and Warton's Observ. v. 2. p. 105. The following Stanzas are taken from Chap. III. and IV. “How Fame departed from Graunde Amour and left him with Governaunce and Grace, and howe he went to the Tower of Doctrine, &amp;c.”—As we are able to give no small lyric piece of Hawes's, the reader will excuse the insertion of this extract. I loked about and saw a craggy roche, Farre in the west neare to the element, And as I dyd then unto it approche, Upon the toppe I sawe refulgent The royal tower of Morall Document, Made of fine copper with turrettes fayre and hye, Which against Phebus shone soe marveylously, That for the very perfect bryghtnes What of the tower, and of the cleare sunne, I could nothyng behold the goodlines Of that palaice, whereas Doctrine did wonne: Tyll at the last, with mysty wyndes donne, The radiant brightnes of golden Phebus Auster gan cover with clowde tenebrus. Then to the tower I drewe nere and nere, And often mused of the great hyghnes Of the craggy rocke, which quadrant did appeare: But the fayre tower, (so much of ryches Was all about,) sexangled doubtles; Gargeyld with grayhoundes, and with many lyons, Made of fyne golde; with divers sundry dragons. The little ‘turrett’ with ymages of golde turrets. PC. About was set, whiche with the wynde aye moved With propre vices, that I did well beholde About the tower, in sundry wyse they hoved towers. PC. With goodly pypes, in their mouthes ituned, That with the wynd they pyped a daunce Iclipped Amour de la hault plesaunce. The toure was great of marveylous wydnes, To whyche ther was no way to passe but one, Into the toure for to have an intres: A grece there was ychesyld all of stone Out of the rocke, on whyche men dyd gone Up to the toure, and in lykewyse dyd I Wyth bothe the Grayhoundes in my company This alludes to a former part of the Poem.: Tyll that I came unto a ryall gate, Where I sawe stondynge the goodly Portres, Whyche axed me, from whence I came a-late; To whome I gan in every thynge expresse All myne adventure, chaunce, and busynesse, And eke my name; I tolde her every dell: Whan she herde this she lyked me right well. Her name, she sayd, was called Countenaunce; Into the ‘base’ courte she dyd me then lede, besy courte. PC. Where was a fountayne depured of pleasance, A noble sprynge, a ryall conduyte-hede, Made of fyne golde enameled with reed; And on the toppe four dragons blewe and stoute Thys dulcet water in four partes dyd spoute. partyes. PC. Of whyche there flowed foure ryvers ryght clere, Sweter than Nylus Nysus. PC. or Ganges was ther odoure; Tygrys or Eufrates unto them no pere: I dyd than taste the aromatyke lycoure, Fragraunt of fume, and swete as any floure; And in my mouthe it had a marveylous scent Of divers spyces, I knewe not what it ment. And after thys further forth me brought Dame Countenaunce into a goodly Hall, Of jasper stones it was wonderly wrought: The wyndowes cleare depured all of crystall, And in the rouse on hye over all Of golde was made a ryght crafty vyne; Instede of grapes the rubies there did shyne. The flore was paved with berall clarified, With pillers made of stones precious, Like a place of pleasure so gayely glorified, It myght be called a palaice glorious, So muche delectable and solacious; The hall was hanged hye and circuler With cloth of arras in the rychest maner. That treated well of a ful noble story, Of the doubty waye to the Tower Perillous; The story of the poem. Howe a noble knyght should wynne the victory Of many a serpente foule and odious. XI. THE CHILD OF ELLE —is given from a fragment in the Editor's folio MS: which tho' extremely defective and mutilated appeared to have so much merit, that it excited a strong desire to attempt a completion of the story. The Reader will easily discover the supplemental stanzas by their inferiority, and at the same time be inclined to pardon it, when he considers how difficult it must be to imitate the affecting simplicity and artless beauties of the original. Child was a title sometimes given to a knight. See Gloss. On yonder hill a castle standes, With walles and towres bedight, And yonder lives the Child of Elle, A younge and comely knighte. The Child of Elle to his garden wente, And stood at his garden pale, Whan, lo! he beheld fair Emmelines page Come trippinge downe the dale. The Child of Elle he hyed him thence, Y-wis he stoode not stille, And soone he mette faire Emmelines page Come climbing up the hille. Nowe Christe thee save, thou little foot-page, Now Christe thee save and see! Oh telle me how does thy ladye gaye, And what may thy tydinges bee? My lady shee is all woe-begone, And the teares they falle from her eyne; And aye she laments the deadlye feude Betweene her house and thine. And here shee sends thee a silken scarse Bedewde with many a teare, And biddes thee sometimes thinke on her, Who loved thee so deare. And here shee sends thee a ring of golde The last boone thou mayst have, And biddes thee weare it for her sake, Whan she is layde in grave. For, ah! her gentle heart is broke, And in grave soone must shee bee, Sith her father hath chose her a new new love, And forbidde her to think of thee. Her father hath brought her a carlish knight, Sir John of the north countràye, And within three dayes shee must him wedde, Or he vowes he will her slaye. Nowe hye thee backe, thou little foot-page, And greet thy ladye from mee, And telle her that I her owne true love Will dye, or sette her free. Nowe hye thee backe, thou little foot-page, And let thy fair ladye know This night will I bee at her bowre-windòwe, Betide me weale or woe. The boye he tripped, the boye he ranne, He neither stint ne stayd Untill he came to fair Emmelines bowre, Whan kneeling downe he sayd, O ladye, Ive been with thy own true love, And he greets thee well by mee; This night will he bee at thy bowre-windòwe, And dye or sette thee free. Nowe daye was gone, and night was come, And all were fast asleepe, All save the ladye Emmeline, Who sate in her bowre to weepe: And soone shee heard her true loves voice Lowe whispering at the walle, Awake, awake, my deare ladyè, Tis I thy true love call. Awake, awake, my ladye deare, Come, mount this faire palfràye: This ladder of ropes will lette thee downe, Ile carrye thee hence awaye. Nowe nay, nowe nay, thou gentle knight, Now nay, this may not bee; For aye should I tint my maiden fame, If alone I should wend with thee. O ladye, thou with a knighte so true Mayst safelye wend alone, To my ladye mother I will thee bringe, Where marriage shall make us one. “My father he is a baron bolde, Of lynage proude and hye; And what would he saye if his daughtèr Awaye with a knight should fly? Ah! well I wot, he never would rest, Nor his meate should doe him no goode, Till he had slayne thee, Child of Elle, And seene thy deare hearts bloode.” O ladye, wert thou in thy saddle sette, And a little space him fro, I would not care for thy cruel fathèr, Nor the worst that he could doe. O ladye, wert thou in thy saddle sette, And once without this walle, I would not care for thy cruel fathèr, Nor the worst that might befalle. Faire Emmeline sighde, fair Emmeline wept, And aye her heart was woe: At length he seizde her lilly-white hand, And downe the ladder he drewe: And thrice he claspde her to his breste, And kist her tenderlìe: The teares that fell from her fair eyes, Ranne like the fountayne free. Hee mounted himselfe on his steede so talle, And her on a faire palfràye, And slung his bugle about his necke, And roundlye they rode awaye. All this beheard her owne damsèlle, In her bed whereas shee ley, Quoth shee, My lord shall knowe of this, Soe I shall have golde and fee. Awake, awake, thou baron bolde! Awake, my noble dame! Your daughter is fledde with the Child of Elle, To doe the deede of shame. The baron he woke, the baron he rose, And callde his merrye men all: “And come thou forth, Sir John the knighte, The ladye is carried to thrall.” Faire Emmeline scant had ridden a mile, A mile forth of the towne, When she was aware of her fathers men Come galloping over the downe: And foremost came the carlish knight, Sir John of the north countràye: “Nowe stop, nowe stop, thou false taitòure, Nor carry that ladye awaye. For she is come of hye lynàge, And was of a ladye borne, And ill it beseems thee a false churles sonne To carrye her hence to scorne.” Nowe loud thou lyest, Sir John the knight, Nowe thou doest lye of mee; A knight mee gott, and a ladye me bore, Soe never did none by thee. But light nowe downe, my ladye faire, Light downe, and hold my steed, While I and this discourteous knighte Doe trye this arduous deede. But light now downe, my deare ladyè, Light downe, and hold and horse; While I and this discourteous knight Doe trye our valours force. Fair Emmeline sighde, fair Emmeline wept, And aye her heart was woe, While twixt her love and the carlish knight Past many a baleful blowe. The Child of Elle hee fought soe well, As his weapon he wavde amaine, That soone he had slaine the carlish knight, And layde him upon the plaine. And nowe the baron, and all his men Full fast approached nye: Ah! what may ladye Emmeline doe? Twere nowe no boote to flye. Her lover he put his horne to his mouth, And blew both loud and shrill, And soone he saw his owne merry men Come ryding over the hill. “Nowe hold thy hand, thou bold baròn, I pray thee, hold thy hand, Nor ruthless rend two gentle hearts, Fast knit in true loves band. Thy daughter I have dearly lovde Full long and many a day; But with such love as holy kirke Hath freelye sayd wee may. O give consent, shee may be mine, And blesse a faithfull paire: My lands and livings are not small, My house and lynage faire: My mother she was an erles daughtèr, And a noble knyght my sire— The baron he frownde, and turnde away With mickle dole and ire. Fair Emmeline sighde, faire Emmeline wept, And did all tremblinge stand: At lengthe she sprange upon her knee, And held his lifted hand. Pardon, my lorde and father deare, This faire yong knyght and mee: Trust me, but for the carlish knyght, I never had fled from thee. Oft have you callde your Emmeline Your darling and your joye; O let not then your harsh resolves Your Emmeline destroye. The baron he stroakt his dark-brown cheeke, And turnde his heade asyde To whipe awaye the starting teare, He proudly strave to hyde. In deepe revolving thought he stoode, And musde a little space; Then raisde faire Emmeline from the grounde, With many a fond embrace. Here take her, Child of Elle, he sayd, And gave her lillye hand; Here take my deare and only child, And with her half my land: Thy father once mine honour wrongde In dayes of youthful pride; Do thou the injurye repayre In fondnesse for thy bride. And as thou love her, and hold her deare, Heaven prosper thee and thine: And nowe my blessing wend wi' thee, My lovelye Emmeline. XII. ADAM O' GORDON, A Scottish Ballad —was printed at Glasgow, by Robert and Andrew Foulis, MDCCLV. 8vo. 12 pages.—We are indebted for its publication (with many other valuable things in those volumes) to Sir David Dalrymple, Bart. who gave it as it was preserved in the memory of a lady, that is now dead. The reader will here find it improved, and enlarged with several fine stanzas, recovered from a fragment of the same ballad, in the Editor's folio MS. It is remarkable that the latter is intitled Captain Adam Carre, and is in the English idiom. But whether the author was English or Scotch, the difference originally was not great. The English Ballads are generally of the North of England, the Scottish are of the South of Scotland, and of consequence the country of Ballad-singers was sometimes subject to one crown, and sometimes to the other, and most frequently to neither. Most of the finest old Scotch songs have the scene laid within 20 miles of England; which is indeed all poetic ground, green hills, remains of woods, clear brooks. The pastoral scenes remain: Of the rude chivalry of former ages happily nothing remains, but the ruins of the castles, where the more daring and successful robbers resided. The House, or Castle of the Rodes, stood about a measured mile south from Duns in Berwickshire: some of the ruins of it may be seen to this day. The Gordons were anciently seated in the same county: the two villages of East and West Gordon lie about 10 miles from the castle of the Rodes This ballad is well known in that neighbourhood, where it is intitled Adam o' Gordon. It may be observed, that the famous freebooter, whom Edward I. fought with, hand to hand, near Farmham, was named Adam Gordon.. Whether this ballad hath any foundation in fact, we have not been able to discover. It contains however but too just a picture of the violences practised in the feudal times all over Europe. From the different titles of this ballad, it should seem that the old strolling bards or minstrels (who gained a livelihood by reciting these poems) made no scruple of changing the names of the personages they introduced, to humour their hearers. For instance, if a Gordon's conduct was blame-worthy in the opinion of that age, the obsequious minstrel would, when among Gordons, change the name to Car, whose clan or sept lay further west, and vice versâ. In the third volume the reader will find a similar instance. See the song of Gil Morris, the hero of which had different names given him, perhaps from the same cause. It may be proper to mention, that in the English copy, instead of the “Castle of the Rodes,” it is the “Castle of Bittons-borrow,” (or “Diactours-borrow,” for it is very obscurely written), and “Capt. Adam Carre” is called the “Lord of Westerton-town.” Uniformity required that the additional stanzas supplied from that copy should be clothed in the Scottish orthography and idiom: this has therefore been attempted, though perhaps imperfectly. It fell about the Martinmas, Quhen the wind blew schril and cauld, Said Edom o' Gordon to his men, We maun draw to a hauld. And quhat a hauld sall we draw to, My mirry men and me? We wul gae to the house o' the Rodes, To see that fair ladìe. The lady stude on hir castle wa', Beheld baith dale and down: There she was ware of a host of men Cum ryding towards the toun. O see ze nat, my mirry men a'? O see ze nat quhat I see? Methinks I see a host of men: I marveil quha they be. She weend it had been hir luvely lord, As he cam ryding hame; It was the traitor Edom o' Gordon, Quha reckt nae sin nor shame. She had nae sooner buskit hirsel, And putten on hir goun, Till Edom o' Gordon and his men Were round about the toun. They had nae sooner supper sett, Nae sooner said the grace, Till Edom o' Gordon and his men, Were light about the place. The lady ran up to hir towir head, Sa fast as she could drie, To see if by hir fair speechès She could wi' him agree. But quhan he see this lady saif, And hir yates all locked fast, He fell into a rage of wrath, And his hart was all aghast. Cum doun to me, ze lady gay, Cum doun, cum doun to me: This night sall ye lig within mine armes, To-morrow my bride sall be. I winnae cum doun, ze fals Gordòn, I winnae cum doun to thee; I winnae forsake my ain dear lord, That is sae far frae me. Give owre zour house, ze lady fair, Give owre zour house to me, Or I sall brenn yoursel therein, Bot and zour babies three. I winnae give owre, ze false Gordòn, To nae sik traitor as zee; And if ze brenn my ain dear babes, My lord sall make ze drie. But reach my pistol, Glaud, my man, And charge ze weil my gun: For, but if I pierce that bluidy butcher, My babes we been undone. She stude upon hir castle wa', And let twa bullets flee: She mist that bluidy butchers hart, And only raz'd his knee. The two foregoing stanzas have been apparently modernized. Set fire to the house, quo' fals Gordòn, All wood wi' dule and ire: Fals lady, ze sall rue this deid, As ze brenn in the fire. Wae worth, wae worth ze, Jock my man, I paid ze weil zour fee; Quhy pow ze out the ground-wa stane, Lets in the reek to me? And ein wae worth ze, Jock my man, I paid ze weil zour hire; Quhy pow ze out the ground-wa stane, To me lets in the fire? Ze paid me weil my hire, lady; Ze paid me weil my see: But now Ime Edom o' Gordons man, Maun either doe or die. O than bespaik hir little son, Sate on the nourice' knee: Sayes, Mither deare, gi owre this house, For the reek it smithers me. I wad gie a' my gowd, my childe, Sae wad I a' my fee, For ane blast o' the westlin wind, To blaw the reek frae thee. O then bespaik hir dochter dear, She was baith jimp and sma: O row me in a pair o' sheits, And tow me owre the wa. They rowd hir in a pair o' sheits, And towd hir owre the wa: But on the point of Gordons spear, She gat a deadly fa. O bonnie bonnie was hir mouth, And cherry were hir cheiks, And clear clear was hir zellow hair, Whereon the reid bluid dreips. Then wi' his spear he turnd hir owre, O gin hir face was wan! a Scottish idiom to express great admiration. He sayd, Ze are the first that eir I wisht alive again. He turnd hir owre and owre again, O gin hir skin was whyte! a Scottish idiom to express great admiration. I might ha spared that bonnie face To hae been sum mans delyte. Busk and boun, my merry men a', For ill dooms I doe guess; I cannae luik in that bonnie face, As it lyes on the grass. Thame, luiks to freits, my master deir, i.e. Them that look after omens of ill luck, ill luck will follow. Then freits wil follow thame: i.e. Them that look after omens of ill luck, ill luck will follow. Let it neir be said brave Edom o' Gordon Was daunted by a dame. But quhen the ladye see the fire Cum flaming owre hir head, She wept and kist her children twain, Sayd, Bairns, we been but dead. The Gordon then his bougill blew, And said, Awa', awa'; This house o' the Rodes is a' in flame, I hauld it time to ga'. O then bespyed hir ain dear lord, As hee cam owre the lee; He sied his castle all in blaze Sa far as he could see. Then sair, O sair his mind misgave, And all his hart was wae: Put on, put on, my wighty men, So fast as ze can gae. Put on, put on, my wighty men, Sa fast as ze can drie; For he that is hindmost of the thrang, Sall neir get guid o' me. Than sum they rade, and sum they rin, Fou fast out-owre the bent; But eir the foremost could get up, Baith lady and babes were brent. He wrang his hands, he rent his hair, And wept in teenefu' muid: O traitors, for this cruel deid Ze sall weip teirs o' bluid. And after the Gordon he is gane, Sa fast as he micht drie; And soon i' the Gordon's foul hartis bluid, He's wroken his dear ladìe. THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. I. ADAM BELL, CLYM OF THE CLOUGH, AND WILLIAM OF CLOUDESLY —were three noted outlaws, whose skill in archery rendered them formerly as famous in the North of England, as Robin Hobin and his fellows were in the midland counties. Their place of residence was in the forest of Englewood, not far from Carlisle, (called corruptly in the ballad English-wood, whereas Engle, or Ingle-wood signifies Wood for firing.) At what time they lived does not appear. The author of the common ballad on “The pedigree, education, and marriage, of Robin Hood,” makes them contemporary with Robin Hood's father, in order to give him the honour of beating them: viz. The father of Robin a Forester was, And he shot in a lusty long-bow Two north-country miles and an inch at a shot, As the Pindar of Wakefield does know: For he brought Adam Bell, and Clim of the Clough, And William a Clowdéslee To shoot with our Forester for forty mark; And our Forester beat them all three. Collect. of Old Ballads. 1727. 1 vol. p. 67. This seems to prove that they were commonly thought to have lived before the popular Hero of Sherwood. Our northern archers were not unknown to their southern countrymen, their excellence at the long-bow is often alluded to by our ancient poets. Shakespeare, in his comedy of “Much adoe about nothing,” Act 1. makes Benedicke confirm his resolves of not yielding to love, by this protestation, “If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat Bottles formerly were of leather; though perhaps a wooden bottle might be here meant. It is still a diversion in Scotland to hang up a cat in a small cask or firkin, half filled with soot: and then a parcel of clowns on horseback try to beat out the ends of it, in order to shew their dexterity in escaping before the contents fall upon them., and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapt on the shoulder and called Adam:” meaning Adam Bell, as Theobald rightly observes, who refers to one or two other passages in our old poets wherein he is mentioned. The Oxford editor has also well conjectured that “Abraham Cupid” in Romeo and Juliet, A. 2. s. 1. should be “Adam Cupid,” in allusion to our archer. Ben Johnson has mentioned Clym o' the Clough in his Alchemist, Act 1. sc. 2. And Sir William Davenant, in a mock poem of his, called “The long vacation in London,” describes the Attorneys and Proctors, as making matches to meet in Finsbury fields. “With loynes in canvas bow-case tyde; “Where arrowes stick with mickle pride; . . . . “Like ghosts of Adam Bell and Clymme. “Sol sets for fear they'l shoot at him.” Works, p. 291. fol. 1673. I have only to add further concerning the principal Hero of this Ballad, that the Bells were noted rogues in the North so late as the time of Q. Elizabeth. See in Rymer's Fædera, a letter from lord William Howard to some of the officers of state, wherein he mentions them. As for the following stanzas, they will be judged from the style, orthography, and numbers, to be very ancient: they are given from an old black-letter quarto, Imprinted at London in Lothburye by Wyllyam Copland (no date): corrected in some places by another copy in the editor's folio MS. In that volume this ballad is followed by another, intitled Younge Cloudeslee, being a continuation of the present story, and reciting the adventures of William of Cloudesly's son: but greatly inferior to this both in merit and antiquity. Part the First. Mery it was in grene forèst Amonge the levès grene, Wheras men hunt east and west Wyth bowes and arrowes kene; To ryse the dere out of theyr denne; Suche sightes hath ofte bene sene; As by thre yemen of the north countrèy, By them it is I meane. The one of them hight Adam Bel, The other Clym of the Clough, The thyrd was William of Cloudesly, An archer good ynough. They were outlawed for venyson, These yemen everychone; They swore them brethren upon a day, To Englyshe wood for to gone. Now lith and lysten, gentylmen, That of myrthe loveth to here: Two of them were singele men, The third had a wedded fere. Wyllyam was the wedded man, Muche more than was hys care: He sayde to hys brethren upon a day, To Carleil he wold fare; Caerlel, in PC. passim. For to speke with fayre Alyce his wife, And with hys chyldren thre. By my trouth, sayde Adam Bel, Not by the counsell of me: For if ye go to Carleil, brother, And from thys wylde wode wende, If the justice may you take, Your lyfe were at an ende. If that I come not to-morowe, brother, By pryme to you agayne, Truste not els, but that I am take, Or else that I am slayne. He toke hys leave of hys brethren two, And to Carleil he is gon: There he knocked at his owne windòwe Shortlye and anone. Wher be you, fayre Alyce my wyfe, And my chyldren thre? Lyghtly let in thyne owne husbànde, Wyllyam of Cloudeslè. Alas! then sayde fayre Alyce, And syghed wonderous sore, Thys place hath ben besette for you Thys halfe yere and more. Now am I here, sayde Cloudeslè, I wold that in I were: Now fetche us meate and drynke ynoughe, And let us make good chere. She fetched hym meate and drynke plentyè, Lyke a true wedded wyfe; And pleased hym with that she had, Whome she loved as her lyfe. There lay an old wyfe in that place, A lytle besyde the fyre, Whych Wyllyam had found of charytyè More than seven yere. Up she rose, and forth she goes, Evel mote she spede therefoore; For she had not set no sote on ground In seven yere before. She went unto the justice hall, As fast as she could hye: Thys night is come unto thys town Wyllyam of Cloudeslyè. Thereof the justice was full fayne, And so was the shirife also: Thou shalt not trauaill hither, dame, for nought, Thy meed thou shalt have or thou go. They gave to her a ryght good goune Of scarlate, and of graine: She toke the gyft, and home she wente, And couched her doune agayne. They rysed the towne of mery Carleile In all the haste they can; And came thronging to Wyllyames house, As fast as they might gone. There they besette that good yemàn About on every syde: Wyllyam hearde great noyse of folkes, That they ther-ward they hyed. Alyce opened a back wyndòw, shop window. PC. And loked all aboute, She was ware of the justice and shirife bothe, Wyth a full great route. Alas! treason, cryed Alyce, Ever wo may thou be! Goe into my chamber, husband, she sayd, Swete Wyllyam of Cloudeslè. He toke hys sweard and hys bucler, Hys bow and hys chyldren thre, And wente into hys strongest chamber, Where he thought surest to be. Fayre Alyce, like a lover true, Took a pollaxe in her hande: He shal be deade that here commeth in Thys dore, whyle I may stand. Cloudeslè bente a wel-good bowe, That was of trusty tre, He smot the justise on the brest, That hys arowe brest in three. A curse on his harte, saide William, Thys day thy cote dyd on! If it had ben no better then myne, It had gone nere thy bone. Yeld the Cloudeslè, sayd the justise, Thy bowe and thy arrowes the fro. A curse on hys hart, sayd fair Alyce, That my husband councelleth so. Set fyre on the house, saide the sherife, Syth it wyll no better be, And brenne we therin William, he saide, Hys wyfe and chyldren thre. They fyred the house in many a place, The fyre flew up on hye: Alas! then cryed fayre Alice, I se we here shall dy. William openyd a backe wyndòw, That was in hys chamber hie, And wyth shetes let downe his wyfe, And eke hys chyldren thre. Have here my treasure, sayde William, My wyfe and my chyldren thre: For Christès love do them no harme, But wreke you all on me. Wyllyam shot so wonderous well, Tyll hys arrowes were all agoe, And the fyre so fast upon hym fell, That hys bowstryng brent in two. The sparkles brent and fell upon Good Wyllyam of Cloudeslè: Than was he a wofull man, and sayde, Thys is a cowardes death to me. Lever had I, sayde Wyllyam, With my sworde in the route to renne, Then here among myne enemyes wode Thus cruelly to bren. He toke hys sweard and hys buckler, And among them all he ran, Where the people were most in prece, He smot downe many a man. There myght no man abyde hys stroke, So fersly on them he ran: Then they threw wyndowes, and dores on him, And so toke that good yemàn. There they hym bounde both hand and fote, And in depe dongeon cast: Now Cloudeslè, sayd the hye justice, Thou shalt be hanged in hast. A payre of new gallowes, sayd the sherife, Now shal I for the make; And the gates of Carleil shal be shutte: No man shal come in therat. Then shall not helpe Clym of the Cloughe, Nor yet shal Adam Bell, Though they came with a thousand mo, Nor all the devels in hell. Early in the mornynge the justice uprose, To the gates first gan he gon, And commaundeth to be shut full close Lightilè everychone. Then went he to the markett place, As fast as he coulde hye; A payre of new gallous there he set up Besyde the pyllorye. A lytle boy amonge them asked, “What meaneth that gallow-tre?” They sayde to hange a good yeamàn, Called Wyllyam of Cloudeslè. That lytle boye was the towne swyne-heard, And kept fayre Alyces swyne; Oft he had seene Cloudeslè in the wodde, And geuend hym there to dyne. He went out att a crevis in the wall, And lightly to the woode dyd gone; There met he with these wightye yemen yonge men. PC. Shortly and anone. Alas! then sayde that lytle boye, Ye tary here all to longe; Cloudeslè is taken, and dampned to death, All readye for to honge. Alas! then sayd good Adam Bell, That ever we see thys daye! He had better with us have taryed, So ofte as we dyd hym praye. He myght have dwellyd in grene forèste, Under the shadowes grene, shadowes sheene. PC. And have kepte both hym and us in reste, Out of trouble and teene. Adam bent a ryght good bow, A great hart sone had he slayne: Take that, chylde, he sayde, to thy dynner, And bryng me myne arrowe agayne. Now go we hence, sayed these wightye yeomen, wight yong men. PC. Tary we no lenger here; We shall hym borowe by God his grace, Though we bye it full dere. To Caerleil wente these good yemen, In a mery mornyng of maye. Here is a fyt See Gloss. of Cloudeslye, And another is for to saye. Part the Second. And when they came to mery Carleil, All in the mornyng tyde, They founde the gates shut them untyll About on every syde. Alas! then sayd good Adam Bell, That ever we were made men! These gates be shut so wonderous wel, We may not come here in. Then bespake ‘him’ Clym of the Clough, Wyth a wyle we wyl us in bryng; Let us saye we be messengers, Streyght come nowe from our king. Adam said, I have a letter written, Now let us wysely werke, We wyl saye we have the kynges seales; I holde the porter no clerke. Then Adam Bell bete on the gate With strokes great and strong: The porter herde suche noyse therat, And to the gate he throng. Who is there nowe, sayde the porter, That maketh all thys dinne? We be tow messengers, sayde Clim of the Clough, Be come ryght from our kyng. We have a letter, sayde Adam Bel, To the justice we must it bryng; Let us in our message to do, That we were agayne to the kyng. Here commeth none in, sayd the porter, Be hym that dyed on a tre, Tyll a false thefe be hanged up, Called Wyllyam of Cloudeslè. Then spake the good yeman Clym of the Clough, And swore by Mary fre, And if that we stande long wythout, Lyk a these honge thou shalt be. Lo! here we have the kyngès seale: What, Lurden, art thou wode? Lordeyne. PC. The porter went i. e. weened. it had ben so, And lyghtly dyd off hys hode. Welcome be my lordes seale, he saide; For that ye shall come in. He opened the gate full shortlye; An euyl openyng for him. Now are we in, sayde Adam Bell, Therof we are full faine; But Christ he knowes, that harowed hell, How we shall com out agayne. Had we the keys, said Clim of the Clough, Ryght wel then shoulde we spede, Then might we come out wel ynough When we se tyme and nede. They called the porter to counsell, And wrange hys necke in two, And cast hym in a depe dongeon, And toke hys keys hym fro. Now am I porter, sayd Adam Bel, Se brother the keys are here, The worst porter to merry Carleile The have had thys hundred yere. And now wyll we our bowes bend, Into the towne wyll we go, For to delyuer our dere brothèr, That lyeth in care and wo. Then they bent theyr good ewe bowes, And loked theyr stringes were round So Ascham in his Toxophilus gives a precept; “The Stringe must be rounde:” (p. 149. Ed. 1761.) otherwise, we may conclude from mechanical principles, the Arrow will not fly true., The markett place in mery Carleile They beset that stound. And, as they loked them besyde, A paire of new galowes thei see, And the justice with a quest of squyers, Had judged theyr fere to de. And Cloudeslè hymselfe lay in a carte, Fast bound both fote and hand; And a stronge rop about hys necke, All readye for to hange. The justice called to him a ladde, Cloudeslès clothes should he have, To take the measure of that yemàn, Therafter to make hys grave. I have sene as great mervaile, said Cloudeslè, As betweyne thys and pryme, He that maketh thys grave for me Hymselfe may lye therin. Thou speakest proudli, said the justice, I shall the hange with my hande. Full wel herd this his brethren two, There styll as they dyd stande. Then Cloudeslè cast his eyen asyde, And saw hys brethren twaine At a corner of the market place, Redy the justice for to slaine. I se comfort, sayd Cloudeslè, Yet hope I well to fare, If I might have my handes at wyll Ryght lytle wolde I care. Then bespake good Adam Bell To Clym of the Clough so free, Brother, se ye marke the justyce wel; Lo! yonder ye may him se: And at the shyrife shote I wyll Strongly wyth arrowe kene; A better shote in mery Carleile Thys seven yere was not sene. They loosed their arrowes both at once, lowsed thre. PC. Of no man had the dread; The one hyt the justice, the other the sheryfe, That both theyr sides gan blede. can bled. MS. All men voyded, that them stode nye, When the justice fell to the grounde, And the sherife fell hym by; Eyther had his deathes wounde. All the citezens fast gan flye, They durst no lenger abyde: There lyghtly they loosed Cloudeslè, Where he with ropes lay tyde. Wyllyam sterte to an officer of the towne, Hys axe fro hys hand he wronge, On eche syde he smote them downe, Hym thought he taryed to long. Wyllyam sayde to hys brethren two, Thys daye let us lyve and de, If ever you have nede, as I have now, The same shall you finde by me. They shot so well in that tyde, Theyr stringes were of silke ful sure, That they kept the stretes on every side; That batayle did long endure. The fought together as brethren tru, Lyke hardy men and bolde, Many a man to the ground they thrue, And many a herte made colde. But when their arrowes were all gon, Men preced to them full fast, They drew theyr swordès then anone, And theyr bowes from them cast. They wenten lyghtlye on theyr way, Wyth swordes and bucklers round; By that it was myd of the day, They made mani a wound. There was many an out horne in Carleil blowen, And the belles bacwàrd dyd ryng, Many a woman sayde, Alas! And many theyr handes dyd wryng. The mayre of Carleile forth was com, Wyth hym a ful great route: These yemen dred hym full sore, Of theyr lyves they stode in doute. The mayre came armed a full great pace, With a pollaxe in hys hande; Many a strong man wyth him was, There in that stowre to stande. The mayre smot at Cloudeslè with his bil, Hys bucler he brast in two, Full many a yeman with great evyll, Alas! they cryed for wo. Kepe we the gates fast, they bad, That these traytours therout not go. But al for nought was that the wrought, For so fast they downe were layde, Tyll they all thre, that so manfulli fought, Were gotten without, abraide. Have here your keys, sayd Adam Bel, Myne office I here forsake, And yf you do by my counsell A new porter do ye make. He threw theyr keys at theyr heads, And bad them well to thryve, And all that letteth any good yeman To come and comfort his wyfe. Thus be these good yemen gon to the wod, And lyghtly, as lefe on lynde; The lough and be mery in theyr mode, Theyr foes were ferr behynd. And when they came to Englyshe wode, merry green wood. PC. Under the trusty tre, There they found bowes full good, And arrowes full great plentye. So God me help, sayd Adam Bell, And Clym of the Clough so fre, I would we were in mery Carleile, Before that fayre meynè. They set them downe, and made good chere, And eate and dranke full well. A second fyt of the wightye yeomen, Another I wyll you tell. Part the Third. As they sat in Englyshe wood, Under the green-wode tre, They thought they herd a woman wepe, But her they mought not se. Sore then syghed the fayre Alyce: That ever I sawe thys day! For nowe is my dere husband slayne: Alas! and wel-a-way! Myght I have spoke wyth hys dere brethren, Or with eyther of them twayne, To shew to them what him befell, My hart were out of payne. Cloudeslè walked a lytle beside, Lookt under the grene wood linde, He was ware of his wife, and chyldren three, Full wo in harte and mynde. Welcome, wyfe, then sayde Wyllyam, Under this trusti tre: I wende yesterday, by swete saynt John, I had wende. PC. Thou shulde me never have se. never had se. PC. “Now well is me that ye be here, My harte is out of wo.” Dame, he sayde, be mery and glad, And thanke my brethren two. Herof to speake, said Adam Bell, I-wis it is no bote: The meate, that we must supp withall, It runneth yet fast on fote. Then went they downe into a launde, These noble archares thre; Eche of them slew a hart of greece, The best that they cold se. Have here the best, Alyce, my wyfe, Sayde Wyllyam of Cloudeslye; By cause ye so bouldly stode by me When I was slayne full nye. Then went they to suppère Wyth suche meate as they had; And thanked God of ther fortune: They were both mery and glad. And when they had supped well, Certayne wythouten lease, Cloudeslè sayd, We wyll to our kyng, To get us a charter of peace. Alyce shal be at our sojournyng In a nunnery here besyde; My tow sonnes shall wyth her go, And there they shall abyde. Myne eldest son shall go wyth me; For hym have I no care: And he shall breng you worde agayn, How that we do fare. Thus be these yemen to London gone, As fast as they myght he, Tyll they came to the kynge's pallàce, Where they woulde nedes be. And whan they came to the kyngès courte, Unto the pallace gate, Of no man wold they aske no leave, But boldly went in therat. They preced prestly into the hall, Of no man had they dreade: The porter came after, and dyd them call, And with them gan to chyde. The usher sayde, Yemen, what would ye have? I pray you tell to me: You myght thus make offycers shent: Good syrs, of whence be ye? Syr, we be out-lawes of the forest Certayne withouten lease; And hether we be come to our kyng To get us a charter of peace. And whan they came before the kyng, As it was the lawe of the lande, The kneled downe without lettyng, And eche held up his hand. The sayed, Lord, we beseche the here, That ye wyll graunt us grace; For we have slayne your fat falow dere In many a sondry place. What be your nams, then said our king, Anone that you tell me? They sayd, Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough, And Wyllyam of Cloudeslè. Be ye those theves, then sayd our kyng, That men have tolde of to me? Here to God I make an avowe, Ye shal be hanged all thre. Ye shal be dead withoute mercy, As I am kynge of this lande. He commandeth his officers every one, Fast on them to lay hande. There they toke these good yemen, And arested them all thre: So may I thryve, sayd Adam Bell, Thys game lyketh not me. But, good lorde, we beseche you now, That yee graunt us grace, Insomuche as frelè to you we comen, As frelè fro you to passe, With such weapons, as we have here, Tyll we be out of your place; And yf we lyve this hundreth yere, We wyll aske you no grace. Ye speake proudly, sayd the kynge; Ye shall be hanged all thre. That were great pitye, then sayd the quene, If any grace myght be. My lorde, whan I came fyrst into this lande To be your wedded wyfe, The fyrst boone that I wold aske, bowne, PC. Ye would graunt it me belyfe: And I never asked none tyll now; Then, good lorde, graunt it me. Now aske it, madam, sayd the kynge, And graunted it shall be. Then, good my lord, I you beseche, These yemen graunt ye me. Madame, ye myght have asked a boone, bowne, PC. That shuld have been worth them all three. Ye myght have asked towres, and townes, Parkes and forestes plentè. But none soe pleasant to my pay, shee sayd; Nor none so lefe to me. Madame, sith it is your desyre, Your askyng graunted shal be; But I had lever have geven you Good market townes thre. The quene was a glad woman, And sayde, Lord, gramarcyè God a mercye. MS. I dare undertake for them, That true men they shal be. But good my lord, speke som mery word, That comfort they may se. I graunt you grace, then sayd our king, Washe, felos, and to meate go ye. They had not setten but a whyle Certayne without lesynge, There came messengers out of the north With letters to our kyng. And whan the came before the kynge, They knelt downe on theyr kne; Sayd, Lord, your officers grete you well, Of Carleile in the north cuntrè. How fareth my justice, sayd the kyng, And my sherife also? Syr, they be slayne without leasynge, And many an officer mo. Who hath them slayne, sayd the kyng; Anone thou tell to me? “Adam Bell, and Clime of the Clough, And Wyllyam of Cloudeslè.” Alas for rewth! then sayd our kynge: My hart is wonderous fore; I had lever than a thousande pounde, I had knowne of thys before: For I have graunted them grace, And that forthynketh me: But had I knowne all thys before, They had been hanged all thre. The kyng hee opened the letter anone, Himselfe he red it tho, And founde how these outlawes had slain Thre hundred men and mo: Fyrst the justice, and the sheryfe, And the mayre of Carleile towne; Of all the constables and catchipolles Alyve were scant left one: The baylyes, and the bedyls both, And the sergeaunte of the law, And forty fosters of the fe, These outlawes had yslaw: And broke his parks, and slayne his dere; Of all they chose the best; So perelous out-lawes, as they were, Walked not by easte nor west. When the kynge this letter had red, In harte he syghed sore: Take up the tables anone he bad, For I may eat no more. The kyng called hys best archars To the buttes wyth hym to go: I wyll se these felowes shote, he sayd, In the north have wrought this wo. The kynges bowmen busket them blyve, blythe. MS. And the quenes archers also; So dyd these thre wyghtye yemen; With them they thought to go. There twyse, or thryse they shote about For to assay theyr hande; There was no shote these yemen shot, That any prycke i.e. mark. myght stand. Then spake Wyllyam of Cloudeslè; By him that for me dyed, I hold hym never no good archar, That shoteth at buttes so wyde. “At what a butte now wold ye shote, I pray thee tell to me?” At suche a but, syr, he sayd, As men use in my countrè. Wyllyam wente into a fyeld, With his two brethèrene: to. PC. There they set up two hasell roddes to. PC. Full twenty score betwene. Twenty score paces. PC. i. e. 400 yards. I hold him an archar, said Cloudeslè, That yonder wande cleveth in two. Here is none suche, sayd the kyng, Nor none that can so do. I shall assaye, syr, sayd Cloudeslè, Or that I farther go. Cloudesly with a bearyng arowe Clave the wand in two. to. PC. Thou art the best archer, then said the king, For sothe that ever I se. And yet for your love, sayd Wyllyam, I wyll do more maystery. I have a sonne is seven yere olde, He is to me full deare; I wyll hym tye to a stake; All shall se, that be here; And lay an apple upon hys head, And go syxe score hym fro, Six-score paces. PC. i. e. 120 yards. And I my selfe with a brode aròw Shall cleve the apple in two. Now haste the, then sayd the kyng, By hym that dyed on a tre, But yf thou do not, as thou hest sayde, Hanged shalt thou be. And thou touche his head or gowne, In syght that men may se, By all the sayntes that be in heaven, I shall hange you all thre. That I have promised, said William, That wyll I never forsake. And there even before the kynge In the earth he drove a stake: And bound therto his eldest sonne, And bad hym stand styll thereat; And turned the childes face him fro, Because he should not sterte. An apple upon his head he set, And then his bowe he bent: Syxe score paces they were out mete, And thether Cloudeslè went. There he drew out a fayr brode arrowe, Hys bowe was great and longe, He set that arrowe in his bowe, That was both styffe and stronge. He prayed the people, that wer there, That they still wold stand, For he that shoteth for such a wager, Behoveth a stedfast hand. steedye. MS. Muche people prayed for Cloudeslè, That his lyfe saved myght be, And whan he made hym redy to shote, There was many weeping ee. But Cloudeslè clefte the apple in twaine, His sonne he did not nee. Over Gods forbode, sayde the kinge, That thou shold shote at me. I geve thee eightene pence a day, And my bowe shalt thou bere, And over all the north countrè I make the chyfe rydère. And I thyrtene pence a day, said the quene, By God, and by my fay; Come feche thy payment when thou wylt, No man shall say the nay. Wyllyam, I make the a gentleman Of clothyng, and of fe: And thy two brethren, yemen of my chambre, For they are so semely to se. Your sonne, for he is tendre of age, Of my wyne seller he shall be; And when he commeth to mans estate, Shal better avaunced be. And, Wyllym, bring to me your wife, Me longeth her sore to se: She shall be my chefe gentlewoman, To governe my nurserye. The yemen thanketh them curteously. To some byshop wyl we wend, Of all the synnes, that we have done, To be assoyld at his hand. So forth be gone these good yemen, As fast as they might he he. i.e. hie, hasten. See the Glossary.; And after came and dwelled with the kynge, And dyed good men all thre. Thus endeth the lives of these good yemen; God send them eternall blysse. And all, that with a hand-bowe shoteth, That of heven they never mysse. Amen. II. THE AGED LOVER RENOUNCETH LOVE. The Grave-digger's song in Hamlet, A. 5. is taken from three stanzas of the following poem, though greatly altered and disguised, as the same were corrupted by the ballad-singers of Shakespeare's time; or perhaps so designed by the poet himself, the better to paint the character of an illiterate clown. The original is preserved among Surrey's Poems, and is attributed to Lord Vaux, by George Gascoigne, who tells us, it “was thought by some to be made upon his death-bed;” a popular error which he laughs at. (See his Epist. to Yong Gent. prefixed to his Posies 1575. 4to.) It is also ascribed to Lord Vaux in a manuscript copy preserved in the British Musuem Harl. MSS. num. 1703. §25. The readings gathered from that copy are distinguished here by inverted commas. The text is printed from the “Songs, &amp;c. of the Earl of Surrey and others. 1557. 4to.”. This Lord was remarkable for his skill in drawing feigned manners, &amp;c. for so I understand an ancient writer. “The Lord Vaux his commendation lyeth chiefly in the facilitie of his meetre, and the aptnesse of his descriptions such as he taketh upon him to make, namely in sundry of his Songs, wherein he showeth the counterfait action very lively and pleasantly.” Arte of Eng. Poesie, 1589. p. 51. See another Song by this Poet in vol. 2. p. 45. I lothe that I did love; In youth that I thought swete: As time requires for my behove, Methinkes they are not mete.

II. sc. 7. the Hero of the Play takes occasion to banter Polonius with some scraps of an old Ballad, which has never appeared yet in any collection: for which reason, as it is but short, it will not perhaps be unacceptable to the Reader; who will also be diverted with the pleasant absurdities of the composition. It was retrieved from utter oblivion by a lady, who wrote it down from memory as she had formerly heard it sung by her father. I am indebted for it to the friendship of Mr. Steevens. The Banter of Hamlet is as follows:“ Hamlet. “O Jephta, Judge of Israel,” what a treasure hadst thou?Polonius. What a treasure had he, my Lord?Ham. Why, “One faire daughter, and no more, the which he loved passing well.”Pol. Still on, my daughter.Ham. Am not I i'th' right, old Jephta?Polon. If you call me Jephta, my Lord; I have a daughter, that I love passing well.Ham. Nay, that followes not.Polon. What followes then, my Lord?Ham. Why, “As by lot, God wot:” and then you know, “It came to passe, As most like it was.” The first row of the Pont chanson will shew you more.” First fol. Edit. p. 263. Have you not heard these many years ago, Jephta was judge of Israel? He had one only daughter and no mo, The which he loved passing well: And, as by lott, God wot, It so came to pass, As Gods will was, That great wars there should be, And none should be chosen chief but he. And when he was appointed judge, And chieftain of the company, A solemn vow to God he made; If he returnd with victory, At his return To burn The first live thing, That should meet with him then, Off his house, when he shoud return agen. It came to pass, the wars was oer, And he returnd with victory; His dear and only daughter first of all Came to meet her father foremostly: And all the way She did play On tabret and pipe Full many a stripe, With note so high, For joy that her father is come so nigh. But when he saw his daughter dear Coming on most foremostly, He wrung his hands, and tore his hair, And cryed out most piteously; Oh! its thou, said he, That have brought me very low, And troubled me so, That I know not what to do. For I have made a vow, he sed, The which must be replenished: “What thou hast spoke Do not revoke: What thou hast said, Be not affraid; Altho' it be I; Keep promises to God on high. But, dear father, grant me one request, That I may go to the wilderness, Three months there with my friends to stay; There to bewail my virginity; And let there be, Said she, Some two or three Young maids with me.” So he sent her away, For to mourn, for to mourn, till her dying day. IV. A SONG TO THE LUTE IN MUSICKE. Shakespear has made this sonnet the subject of some pleasant ridicule in his Romeo and Juliet, A. IV. Sc. 5. where he introduces Peter putting this Question to the Musicians. “ Peter . . . . why “Silver Sound”? why “Musicke with her silver sound?” what say you, Simon Catling?1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.Pet. Pretty! what say you, Hugh Rebecke?2. Mus. I say, silver sound, because Musicians sound for silver.Pet. Pretty too! what say you, James Sound-post.3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.Pet. . . . I will say for you: It is “Musicke with her silver sound,” because Musicians have no gold for sounding.” First folio Ed. p. 73. This ridicule is not so much levelled at the song itself (which for the time it was written is not inelegant) as at those forced and unnatural explanations often given by us painful editors and expositors of ancient authors. This copy is printed from an old quarto MS in the Cotton Library, [Vesp. A. 25.] entitled “Divers things of Hen. viij's time;” with some corrections from The Paradise of Dainty Devises, 1596. Where gripinge grefes the hart would wounde, And dolefulle dumps the mynde oppresse, There musicke with her silver sound With spede is wont to send redresse: Of trobled mynds, in every sore, Swete musicke hathe a salve in store. In joye yt maks our mirthe abounde, In woe yt cheres our hevy sprites; Be-strawghted heads relyef hath founde, By musickes pleasaunt swete delightes: Our senses all, what shall I say more? Are subjecte unto musicks lore. The Gods by musicke have theire prayse; The lyfe, the soul therein doth joye: For, as the Romayne poet sayes, In seas, whom pyrats would destroy, A dolphin saved from death most sharpe Arion playing on his harpe. O heavenly gyft, that rules the mynd, Even as the sterne dothe rule the shippe! O musicke, whom the gods assinde To comforte manne, whom cares would nippe! Sense thow both man and beste doest move, What beste ys he, wyll the disprove? V. KING COPHETUA AND THE BEGGAR-MAID —is a story often alluded to by our old Dramatic Writers. Shakespear in his Romeo and Juliet, A. II. Sc. 1. makes Mercutio say, —“Her [Venus's] purblind son and heir, “Young Adam See above, p. 130. Cupid, he that shot so true, “When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid.” As the 13th Line of the following ballad seems here particularly alluded to, it is not improbable but Shakespeare wrote it shot so trim, which the players or printers, not perceiving the allusion, might alter to true. The former, as being the more humorous expression, seems most likely to have come from the mouth of Mercutio. In the 2d Part of Hen. IV. A. 5. Sc. 3. Falstaff is introduced affectedly saying to Pistoll, “O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news? “Let king Cophetua know the truth thereof.” These lines Dr. Warburton thinks were taken from an old bombast play of King Cophetua. No such play is, I believe, now to be found; but it does not therefore follow that it never existed. Many dramatic pieces are referred to by old writers See Meres Wits Treas. f. 283. Arte of Eng. Poes. 1589. p. 51, 111, 143, 169., which are not now extant, or even mentioned in any List. In the infancy of the stage, plays were often exhibited that were never printed. It is probably in allusion to the same play that Ben Jonson says in his Comedy of Every man in his humour, A. 3. sc. 4. “I have not the heart to devour thee, an' I might be made as rich as King Cophetua.” At least there is no mention of King Cophetua's riches in the present ballad, which is the oldest I have met with on the subject. It is printed from Rich. Johnson's “Crown Garland of Goulden Roses.” 1612. 12mo. (where it is intitled simply, A Song of a Beggar and a King:) corrected by another copy. I Read that once in Affrica A princely wight did raine, Who had to name Cophetua, As poets they did faine: From natures lawes he did decline, For sure he was not of my mind, He cared not for women-kinde, But did them all disdaine. But, marke, what hapned on a day, As he out of his window lay, He saw a beggar all in gray, The which did cause his paine. The blinded boy, that shootes so trim, From heaven downe did hie; He drew a dart and shot at him, In place where he did lye: Which soone did pierse him to the quicke, And when he felt the arrow pricke, Which in his tender heart did sticke, He looketh as he would dye. What sudden chance is this, quoth he, That I to love must subject be, Which never thereto would agree, But still did it defie? Then from the window he did come, And laid him on his bed, A thousand heapes of care did runne Within his troubled head: For now he meanes to crave her love, And now he seekes which way to proove How he his fancie might remoove, And not this beggar wed. But Cupid had him so in snare, That this poor begger must prepare A salve to cure him of his care, Or els he would be dead. And, as he musing thus did lye, He thought for to devise How he might have her companye, That so did 'maze his eyes. In thee, quoth he, doth rest my life; For surely thou shalt be my wife, Or else this hand with bloody knife The Gods shall sure suffice. Then from his bed he soon arose, And to his pallace gate he goes; Full little then this begger knowes When she the king espies. The gods preserve your majesty, The beggers all gan cry: Vouchsafe to give your charity Our childrens food to buy. The king to them his pursse did cast, And they to part it made great haste; This silly woman was the last That after them did hye. The king he cal'd her back againe, And unto her he gave his chaine; And said, With us you shal remaine Till such time as we dye: For thou, quoth he, shalt be my wife, And honoured for my queene; With thee I meane to lead my life, As shortly shall be seene: Our wedding shall appointed be, And every thing in its degree: Come on, quoth he, and follow me, Thou shalt go shift thee cleane. What is thy name, faire maid? quoth he. Penelophon Shakespeare (who alludes to this ballad in his “Loves Labour lost,” Act IV. Sc. 1.) gives the Begger's name Zenelophon, according to all the old editions: but this seems to be a corruption; for Penelophon, in the text, sounds more like the name of a Woman.—The story of the King and the Beggar is also alluded to in K. Rich. II. Act V. Sc. 7., O king, quoth she: With that she made a lowe courtsèy; A trim one as I weene. Thus hand in hand along they walke Unto the king's pallàce: The king with courteous comly talke This begger doth imbrace: The begger blusheth scarlet red, And straight againe as pale as lead, But not not a word at all she said, She was in such amaze. At last she spake with trembling voyce, And said, O king, I doe rejoyce That you wil take me for your choyce, And my degree's so base. And when the wedding day was come, The king commanded strait The noblemen both all and some Upon the queene to wait. And she behavde herself that day, As if she had never walkt the way; She had forgot her gowne of gray, Which she did weare of late. The proverbe old is come to passe, The priest, when he begins his masse, Forgets that ever clerke he was, He knowth not his estate. Here you may read, Cophetua, Though long time fancie-fed, Compelled by the blinded boy The begger for to wed: He that did lovers lookes disdaine, To do the same was glad and faine, Or else he would himselfe have slaine, In storie, as we read. Disdaine no whit, O lady deere, Here the Poet addresses himself to his mistress. But pitty now thy servant heere, Least that it hap to thee this yeare, As to that king it did. And thus they led a quiet life During their princely raine; And in a tombe were buried both, As writers sheweth plaine. Sheweth was anciently the plur. numb. The lords they tooke it grievously, The ladies tooke it heavily, The commons cryed pitiously, Their death to them was paine. Their fame did sound so passingly, That it did pierce the starry sky, And throughout all the world did flye To every princes realme. VI. TAKE THY OLD CLOAK ABOUT THEE —is supposed to have been originally a Scottish Ballad. The reader here has an ancient copy in the English idiom, with an additional Stanza (the 2d.) never before printed. This curiosity is preserved in the Editor's folio MS. but not without corruptions, which are here removed by the assistance of the Scottish Edit. Shakespear in his Othello, A. 2. has quoted one stanza, with some variations, which are here adopted: The old MS. readings are however given in the margin. This winters weather waxeth cold, And frost doth freese on every hill, And Boreas blowes his blasts soe bold, That all our cattell are like to spill; Bell my wife, who loves no strife, She sayd unto me quietlie, Rise up, and save cow Crumbockes life, Man, put thine old cloake about thee. He. O Bell, why dost thou flyte ‘and scorne’? Thou kenst my cloak is very thin: It is so bare and overworne A cricke he thereon cannot renn: Then Ile noe longer borrowe nor lend, ‘For once Ile new appareld bee, To-morrow Ile to towne and spend,’ For Ile have a new cloake about mee. She. Cow Crumbocke is a very good cowe, Shee has been alwayes true to the payle, Still has helpt us to butter and cheese, I trow, And other things she will not fayle; I wold be loth to see her pine, Good husband, councell take of mee, It is not for us to go soe fine, Then take thine old cloake about thee. He. My cloake it was a very good cloake, Itt hath been alwayes true to the weare, But now it is not worth a groat; I have had it four and forty yeare: Sometime it was of cloth in graine, 'Tis now but a sigh-clout as you may see, It will neither hold out winde nor raine; Ill have a new cloake about mee. She. It is four and fortye yeeres agoe Since th'one of us the other did ken, And we have had betwixt us towe Of children either nine or ten; Wee have brought them up to women and men; In the feare of God I trow they bee; And why wilt thou thyself misken? Man, take thine old cloake about thee. He. O Bell my wife, why dost thou floute! Now is nowe, and then was then: Seeke now all the world throughout, Thou kenst not clownes from gentlemen. They are clad in blacke, greene, yellowe, or ‘gray,’ Soe far above their owne degree: Once in my life Ile ‘doe as they,’ For Ile have a new cloake about mee. She. King Stephen was a worthy peere, King Harry. MS. His breeches cost him but a crowne, I trow his hose. MS. He held them sixpence all too deere; 12 pence MS. Therefore he calld the taylor Lowne. clowne. MS. He was a wight of high renowne, And thouse but of a low degree: Itt's pride that putts the countrye downe, Then take thine old cloake about thee. He. ‘Bell my wife she loves not strife, Yet she will lead me if she can; And oft, to live a quiet life, I am forced to yield, though Ime good-man:’ Itt's not for a man with a woman to threape, Unlesse he first give oer the plea: Where I began I now mun leave, And take mine old cloake about mee. VII. WILLOW, WILLOW, WILLOW. It is from the following stanzas that Shakespeare has taken his song of the Willow, in his Othello, A. 4. s. 3. though somewhat varied and applied by him to a female character. He makes Desdemona introduce it in this pathetic and affecting manner, “My mother had a maid call'd Barbarie: “She was in love; and he, she lov'd, forsook her, “And she prov'd mad. She had a Song of Willow. “An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune; “And she dyed singing it.” This is given from a black-letter copy in the Pepys Collection, thus intitled, “A lovers complaint, being forsaken of his “love. To a pleasant tune.” [Part the First.] A poore soule sat sighing under a sicamore tree; O willow, willow, willow! With his hand on his bosom, his head on his knee: O willow, willow, willow! O willow, willow, willow! Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garland. He sigh'd in his singing, and after each grone, Come willow, &amp;c. I am dead to all pleasure, my true-love is gone; O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd. My love she is turned; untrue she doth prove: O willow, &amp;c. She renders me nothing but hate for my love. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. O pitty me (cried he) ye lovers, each one; O willow, &amp;c. Her heart's hard as marble; she rues not my mone. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. The cold streams ran by him, his eyes wept apace; O willow, &amp;c. The salt tears fell from him, which drowned his face: O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. The mute birds sate by him, made tame by his mones: O willow, &amp;c. The salt tears fell from him, which softned the stones. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd! Let nobody blame me, her scornes I do prove; O willow, &amp;c. She was borne to be faire; I, to die for her love. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd. O that beauty should harbour a heart that's so hard! Sing willow, &amp;c. My true love rejecting without all regard. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. Let love no more boast him in palace, or bower; O willow, &amp;c. For women are trothles, and flote in an houre. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. But what helps complaining? In vaine I complaine: O willow, &amp;c. I must patiently suffer her scorne and disdaine. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. Come, all you forsaken, and sit down by me, O willow, &amp;c. He that 'plaines of his false love, mine's falser than she. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. The willow wreath weare I, since my love did fleet; O willow, &amp;c. A Garland for lovers forsaken most meete. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd! Part the Second. Lowe lay'd by my sorrow, begot by disdaine; O willow, willow, willow! Against her too cruell, still still I complaine, O willow, willow, willow! O willow, willow, willow! Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd! O love too injurious, to wound my poore heart! O willow, &amp;c. To suffer the triumph, and joy in my smart: O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. O willow, willow, willow! the willow garlànd, O willow, &amp;c. A sign of her falsenesse before me doth stand: O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. As here it doth bid to despair and to dye, O willow, &amp;c. So hang it, friends, ore me in grave where I lye: O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd. In grave where I rest mee, hang this to the view O willow, &amp;c. Of all that doe knowe her, to blaze her untrue. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. With these words engraven, as epitaph meet, O willow, &amp;c. “Here lyes one, drank poyson for potion most sweet.” O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. Though she thus unkindly hath scorned my love, O willow, &amp;c. And carelesly smiles at the sorrowes I prove; O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. I cannot against her unkindly exclaim, O willow, &amp;c. Cause once well I loved her, and honoured her name: O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. The name of her sounded so sweete in mine eare, O willow, &amp;c. It rays'd my heart lightly, the name of my deare; O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd. As then 'twas my comfort, it now is my griefe; O willow, &amp;c. It now brings me anguish, then brought me reliefe. O willow, &amp;c. Sing, O the greene willow, &amp;c. Farewell, faire false hearted: plaints end with my breath! O willow, willow, willow! Thou dost loath me, I love thee, though cause of my death. O willow, willow, willow! O willow, willow, willow! Sing, O the greene willow shall be my garlànd. VIII. SIR LANCELOT DU LAKE. This ballad is quoted in Shakespeare's second Part of Henry IV. A. 2. s. 4. The subject of it is taken from the ancient romance of K. Arthur (commonly called Morte Arthur) being a poetical translation of Chap. cviii, cix, cx, in Pt. 1st, as they stand in Ed. 1634. 4to. In the older Editions the Chapters are differently numbered.—This song is given from a printed copy, corrected in part by the folio MS. In the same play of 2 Hen. IV. Silence hums a scrap of one of the old ballads of Robin Hood. It is taken from the following stanza of Robin Hood and the Pindar of Wakefield. All this beheard three wighty yeomen, Twas Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John: With that they espy'd the jolly Pindàr As he sate under a thorne. That ballad may be found on every stall, and therefore is not here reprinted. When Arthur first in court began, And was approved king, By force of armes great victoryes wanne, And conquest home did bring. Then into England straight he came With fifty good and able Knights, that resorted unto him, And were of his round table: And he had justs and turnaments, Wherto were many prest, Wherein some knights did then excell And far surmount the rest. But one Sir Lancelot du Lake, Who was approved well, He for his deeds and feates of armes, All others did excell. When he had rested him a while, In play, and game, and sportt, He said he wold goe prove himselfe In some adventrous sort. He armed rode in forrest wide, And met a damsell faire, Who told him of adventures great, Whereto he gave good eare. Such wold I find, quoth Lancelott: For that cause came I hither. Thou seemst, quoth she, a knight full good, And I will bring thee thither, Wheras a mighty knight doth dwell, That now is of great fame: Therfore tell me what wight thou art, And what may be thy name. “My name is Lancelot du Lake.” Quoth she, it likes me than: Here dwelles a knight who never was Yet matcht with any man: Who has in prison threescore knights And four, that he did wound; Knights of king Arthurs court they be, And of his table round. She brought him to a river side, And also to a tree, Whereon a copper bason hung, And many shields to see. He struck soe hard, the bason broke; And Tarquin soon he spyed: Who drove a horse before him fast, Whereon a knight lay tyed. Sir knight, then sayd Sir Lancelòtt, Bring me that horse-load hither, And lay him downe, and let him rest; Weel try our force together: For, as I understand, thou hast, Soe far as thou art able, Done great despite and shame unto The knights of the Round Table. If thou be of the Table Round, Quoth Tarquin speedilye, Both thee and all thy fellowship I utterly defye. That's over much, quoth Lancelott; Defend thee by and by. They sett their speares unto their steeds, And each att other flye. They coucht their speares, (their horses ran, As though there had been thunder) And strucke them each amidst their shields, Wherewith they broke in sunder. Their horses backes brake under them, The knights were both astound: To avoyd their horses they made haste And light upon the ground. They tooke them to their shields full fast, Their swords they drew out than, With mighty strokes most eagerlye Eache at the other ran. They wounded were, and bled full sore, For breath they both did stand, And leaning on their swordes awhile, Quoth Tarquine, Hold thy hand, And tell to me what I shall aske. Say on, quoth Lancelot tho. Thou art, quoth Tarquine, the best knight That ever I did know; And like a knight, that I did hate: Soe that thou be not hee, I will deliver all the rest, And eke accord with thee. That is well sayd, quoth Lancelott; But sith it must be soe, What knight is that thou hatest thus? I pray thee to me show. His name is Lancelot du Lake, He slew my brother deere; Him I suspect of all the rest: I would I had him here. Thy wish thou hast, but yet unknowne, I am Lancelot du Lake, Now knight of Arthurs Table Round; King Hauds son of Schuwake; And I desire thee do thy worst. Ho, ho, quoth Tarquin tho, One of us two shall end our lives Before that we do go. If thou be Lancelot du Lake, Then welcome shalt thou bee: Wherfore see thou thyself defend, For now defye I thee. They buckled then together so, Like unto wild boares rushing, And with their swords and shields they ran At one another slashing: The ground besprinkled was with blood: Tarquin began to yield; For he gave backe for wearinesse, And lowe did beare his shield. This soone Sir Lancelot espyde, He leapt upon him then, He pull'd him downe upon his knee, And rushing off his helm, Forthwith he strucke his necke in two, And, when he had soe done, From prison threescore knights and four Delivered everye one. IX. CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO PHILLIS —is an attempt to paint a lover's irresolution, but so poorly executed, that it would not have been admitted into this collection, if it had not been quoted in Shakespeare's Twelfth-night, A. 2. sc. 3.—It is found in a little ancient miscellany intitled, “The golden Garland of princely “delights.” 12mo. bl. let. In the same scene of the Twelfth Night, Sir Toby sings a scrap of an old ballad, which is preserved in the Pepys Collection. [Vol. 1. p. 33. 496.] but as it is not only a poor dull performance, but also very long, it will be sufficient here to give the first stanza: The Ballad of Constant Susanna. There dwelt a man in Babylon Of reputation great by fame; He took to wife a faire womàn, Susanna she was callde by name: A woman fair and vertuous; Lady, lady: Why should we not of her learn thus To live godly? If this song of Corydon, &amp;c. has not more merit, it is at least an evil of less magnitude. Farewell, dear love; since thou wilt needs begone, Mine eyes do shew, my life is almost done. Nay I will never die, so long as I can spie There be many mo, though that she doe goe, There be many mo, I fear not: Why then let her goe, I care not. Farewell, farewell; since this I find is true, I will not spend more time in wooing you: But I will seek elsewhere, if I may find love there: Shall I bid her goe? what and if I doe? Shall I bid her goe and spare not? O no, no, no, I dare not. Ten thousand times farewell;—yet stay a while:— Sweet, kiss me once; sweet kisses time beguile: I have no power to move. How now am I in love? Wilt thou needs be gone? Go then, all is one. Wilt thou needs be gone? Oh, hie thee! Nay stay, and do no more deny me. Once more adieu, I see loath to depart Bids oft adieu to her, that holds my heart. But seeing I must lose thy love, which I did choose, Goe thy way for me, since that may not be. Goe thy ways for me. But whither? Goe, oh, but where I may come thither. What shall I doe? my love is now departed. She is as fair, as she is cruel-hearted. She would not be intreated, with prayers oft repeated. If she come no more, shall I die therefore? If she come no more, what care I? Faith, let her goe, or come, or tarry. X. GERNUTUS THE JEW OF VENICE. In the “Life of Pope Sixtus V. translated from the Ialian of Greg. Leti, by the Rev. Mr. Farneworth, folio,” is a remarkable passage to the following effect: “It was reported in Rome, that Drake had taken and plundered St. Domingo in Hispaniola, and carried off an immense booty. This account came in a private letter to Paul Secchi, a very considerable merchant in the city, who had large concerns in those parts, which he had insured. Upon receiving this news, he sent for the insurer Sampson Ceneda, a Jew, and acquainted him with it. The Jew, whose interest it was to have such a report thought false, gave many reasons why it could not possibly be true, and at last worked himself into such a passion, that he said, I'll lay you a pound of my flesh it is a lye. Secchi, who was of a fiery hot temper, replied, I'll lay you a thousand crowns against a pound of your flesh that it is true. The Jew accepted the wager, and articles were immediately executed betwixt them, That if Secchi won, he should himself cut the flesh with a sharp knife from whatever part of the Jew's body he pleased. The truth of the account was soon confirmed; and the Jew was almost distracted, when he was informed, that Secchi had solemnly sworn he would compel him to an exact performance of his contract. A report of this transaction was brought to the Pope, who sent for the parties, and being informed of the whole affair, said, When contracts are made, it is but just they should be fulfilled, as this shall: Take a knife therefore, Secchi, and cut a pound of flesh from any part you please of the Jew's body. We advise you, however, to be very careful; for if you cut but a scruple more or less than your due, you shall certainly be hanged.” The Editor of that book is of opinion, that the scene between Shylock and Antonio in the Merchant of Venice is taken from this incident. But Mr. Warton, in his ingenious “Observations on the Faerie Queen, vol. 1. page 128.” has referred it to the following ballad. Mr. Warton thinks this ballad was written before Shakespeare's play, as being not so circumstantial, and having more of the nakedness of an original. Besides, it differs from the play in many circumstances, which a meer copyist, such as we may suppose the ballad-maker to be, would hardly have given himself the trouble to alter. Indeed he expressly informs us, that he had his story from the Italian writers. See the Connoisseur, Vol. 1. No. 16. After all, one would be glad to know what authority Leti had for the foregoing fact, or at least for connecting it with the taking of St. Domingo by Drake; for this expedition did not happen till 1585, and it is very certain that a play of the Jewe, “representing the greedinesse of worldly chusers, and bloody minds of usurers,” had been exhibited at the play-house called the Bull, before the year 1579, being mentioned in Steph. Gosson's Schoole of abuse Warton, ubi supra., which was printed in that year. As for Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, the earliest edition known of it is in quarto 1600; though it had been exhibited before the year 1598, being mentioned together with eleven other of his plays in Meres's Wits Treasury, &amp;c. 1598. 12mo. fol. 282. The following is printed from an ancient black-letter copy in the Pepys Collection Compared with the Ashmole Copy., intitled, “A new Song, shewing the crueltie of Gernutus, a Jewe, who lending to a merchant an hundred crowns, would have a pound of his fleshe, because he could not pay him at the time appointed. To the tune of Black and yellow.” The First Part. In Venice towne not long agoe A cruel Jew did dwell, Which lived all on usurie, As Italian writers tell. Gernutus called was the Jew, Which never thought to dye, Nor ever yet did any good To them in streets that lie. His life was like a barrow hogge, That liveth many a day, Yet never once doth any good, Until men will him slay. Or like a filthy heap of dung, That lyeth in a whoard; Which never can do any good, Till it be spread abroad. So fares it with the usurer, He cannot sleep in rest, For feare the thiefe will him pursue To plucke him from his nest. His heart doth thinke on many a wile, How to deceive the poore; His mouth is almost ful of mucke, Yet still he gapes for more. His wife must lend a shilling, For every weeke a penny, Yet bring a pledge, that is double worth, If that you will have any. And see, likewise, you keepe your day, Or else you loose it all: This was the living of the wife, Her cow she did it call. Her Cow, &amp;c. seems to have suggested to Shakespeare Shylock's argument for usury taken from Jacob's management of Laban's sheep, Act 1. to which Antonio replies, “Was this inserted to make interest good? “Or are your gold and silver Ewes and rams? Shy. “I cannot tell, I make it breed as fast.” Within that citie dwelt that time A marchant of great fame, Which being distressed in his need, Unto Gernutus came: Desiring him to stand his freind For twelve month and a day, To lend to him an hundred crownes: And he for it would pay Whatsoever he would demand of him, And pledges he should have. No, (quoth the Jew with flearing lookes) Sir, aske what you will have. No penny for the loane of it For one year you shall pay; You may doe me as good a turne, Before my dying day. But we will have a merry jeast, For to be talked long: You shall make me a bond, quoth he, That shall be large and strong: And this shall be the forfeyture; Of your owne fleshe a pound. If you agree, make you the bond, And here is a hundred crownes. With right good will! the marchant says: And so the bond was made. When twelve month and a day drew on That backe it should be payd, The marchants ships were all at sea, And money came not in; Which way to take, or what to doe To thinke he doth begin: And to Gernutus strait he comes With cap and bended knee, And sayde to him, Of curtesie I pray you beare with mee. My day is come, and I have not The money for to pay: And little good the forfeyture Will doe you, I dare say. With all my heart, Gernutus sayd, Commaund it to your minde: In thinges of bigger waight then this You shall me ready finde. He goes his way; the day once past Gernutus doth not slacke To get a sergiant presently; And clapt him on the backe: And layd him into prison strong, And sued his bond withall; And when the judgement day was come, For judgement he did call. The marchants friends came thither fast, With many a weeping eye, For other means they could not find, But he that day must dye. “Of the Jews crueltie; setting foorth the mercifulnesse of the Judge towards the Marchant. To the tune of Blacke and yellow.” The Second Part Some offered for his hundred crownes Five hundred for to pay; And some a thousand, two or three, Yet still he did denay. And at the last ten thousand crownes They offered, him to save. Gernutus sayd, I will no gold, My forfeite I will have. A pound of fleshe is my demand, And that shall be my hire. Then sayd the judge, Yet, good my friend, Let me of you desire To take the flesh from such a place, As yet you let him live: Do so, and lo! an hundred crownes To thee here will I give. No: no: quoth he, no: judgment here: For this it shall be tride, For I will have my pound of fleshe From under his right side. It grieved all the companie His crueltie to see, For neither friend nor foe could helpe But he must spoyled bee. The bloudie Jew now ready is With whetted blade in hand The passage in Shakespeare bears so strong a resemblance to this, as to render it probable that the one suggested the other. See Act IV. sc. 2. Bass. “Why doest thou whet thy knife so earnestly? &amp;c.”, To spoyle the bloud of innocent, By forfeit of his bond. And as he was about to strike In him the deadly blow: Stay (quoth the judge) thy crueltie; I charge thee to do so. Sith needs thou wilt thy forfeit have, Which is of flesh a pound: See that thou shed no drop of bloud, Nor yet the man confound. For if thou doe, like murderer, Thou here shalt hanged be: Likewise of flesh see that thou cut No more than longes to thee: For if thou take either more or lesse To the value of a mite, Thou shalt be hanged presently, As is both law and right. Gernutus now waxt franticke mad, And wotes not what to say; Quoth he at last, Ten thousand crownes, I will that he shall pay; And so I graunt to set him free. The judge doth answere make; You shall not have a penny given; Your forfeyture now take. At the last he doth demaund But for to have his owne. No, quoth the judge, doe as you list, Thy judgement shall be showne. Either take your pound of flesh, quoth he, Or cancell me your bond. O cruell judge, then quoth the Jew, That doth against me stand! And so with griping grieved mind griped. Ashmol. copy. He biddeth them fare-well. ‘Then’ all the people prays'd the Lord, That ever this heard tell. Good people, that doe heare this song, For trueth I dare well say, That many a wretch as ill as hee Doth live now at this day; That seeketh nothing but the spoyle Of many a wealthey man, And for to trap the innocent Deviseth what they can. From whome the Lord deliver me, And every Christian too, And send to them like sentence eke That meaneth so to do. Since the first Edition of this book was printed, the Editor hath had reason to believe that both Shakespeare and the Author of this Ballad, are indebted for their Story of the Jew (however they came by it) to an Italian Novel, which was first printed at Milan in the year 1554, in a book intitled, Il Pecorone, nel quale si contengono Cinquanta Novelle antiche, &amp;c. republished at Florence about the year 1748, or 9.—The Author was Ser. Giovanni Fiorentino, who wrote in 1378; thirty years after the time, in which the scene of Boccace's Decameron is laid. (Vid. Manni Istoria del decamerone di Giov. Boccac. 4 to Fior. 1744.) That Shakespeare had his Plot from the Novel itself, is evident from his having some incidents from it, which are not found in the Ballad: And I think it will also be found that he borrowed from the Ballad some hints, that were not suggested by the Novel. (See above, Pt. 2d. ver. 25, &amp;c. where instead of that spirited description of the whetted blade, &amp;c. the Prose Narrative coldly says, “The Jew had prepared a razor, &amp;c.” See also some other passages in the same piece.) This however is spoken with diffidence, as I have at present before me only the Abridgment of the Novel which Mr. Johnson has given us at the End of his Commentary on Shakespeare's Play. The Translation of the Italian Story at large, is not easy to be met with, having I believe never been published, though it was printed some years ago with this title,—“The Novel, from which the Merchant of Venice written by Shakespear is taken, translated from the Italian. To which is added a Translation of a Novel from the Decamerone of Boccaccio. London, Printed for M. Cooper. 1755. 8vo.” XI. THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE. The attribution of this poem is questionable. This beautiful sonnet is quoted in the Merry Wives of Windsor, A. 3. sc. 1. and is ascribed (together with the Reply) to Shakespeare himself by all the modern editors of his smaller poems. In Lintot's Collection of them, 12mo. (no date) is a copy of this sonnet containing only four stanzas (the 4th and 6th being wanting), accompanied with the first stanza of the Answer. This edition has some appearance of exactness, and is affirmed to be reprinted from an ancient copy, containing “The passionate pilgrime, and Sonnets to sundry notes of Musicke, by Mr. William Shakespeare. Lond. printed for W. Jaggard. 1599.” —If this may be relied on, then was this sonnet, &amp;c. published, as Shakespeare's, in his Life-time. And yet there is good reason to believe that (not Shakespeare, but) Christopher Marlow, wrote the song, and Sir Walter Raleigh the “Nymph's reply:” For so we are positively assured by Isaac Walton, a writer of some credit, who has inserted them both in his Compleat Angler First printed in the year 1653, but probably written some time before., under the character of “that smooth song, which was made by Kit. Marlow, now at least fifty years ago; and . . . an Answer to it, which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger days. . . . Old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good.”—It also passed for Marlow's in the opinion of his contemporaries; for the editor of the “Muses Library” has reprinted a poem from England's Helicon, 1600, subscribed Ignoto, and thus intitled, “In Imitation of C. Marlow,” beginning thus, “Come live with me, and be my dear, “And we will revel all the year, “In plains and groves, &amp;c.” Upon the whole I am inclined to attribute them to Marlow, and Raleigh; not-withstanding the authority of Shakespeare's Book of Sonnets. For it is well known that as he took no care of his own compositions, so was he utterly regardless what spurious things were fathered upon him. Sir John Oldcastle, Pericles, and the London prodigal, were printed with his name at full length in the title-pages, while he was living, which yet were afterwards rejected by his first editors Heminge and Condell, who were his intimate friends He mentions them both in his will., and therefore no doubt had good authority for setting them aside. The following sonnet appears to have been (as it deserved) a great favourite with our earlier poets: for besides the imitation above-mentioned, another is to be found among Donne's poems, intitled “The Bait,” beginning thus, “Come live with me, and be my love, “And we will some new pleasures prove “Of golden sands, &amp;c. As for Chr. Marlow, who was in high repute for his Dramatic writings, he lost his life by a stab received in a brothel, before the year 1593. See A. Wood, I. 138. Come live with me, and be my love, And we wil all the pleasures prove That hils and vallies, dale and field, And all the craggy mountains yield. There will we sit upon the rocks, And see the shepherds feed their flocks, By shallow rivers, to whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals. There will I make thee beds of roses With a thousand fragrant posies, A cap of flowers, and a kirtle Imbrodered all with leaves of mirtle; A gown made of the finest wool, Which from our pretty lambs we pull; Slippers lin'd choicely for the cold, With buckles of the purest gold; A belt of straw, and ivie buds, With coral clasps, and amber studs: And if these pleasures may thee move, Then live with me, and be my love. The shepherd swains shall dance and sing For thy delight each May mornìng: If these delights thy mind may move, Then live with me, and be my love. The Nymph's Reply. If that the World and Love were young, And truth in every shepherd's toung, These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee, and be thy love. But time drives flocks from field to fold, When rivers rage, and rocks grow cold, And Philomel becometh dumb, And all complain of cares to come. The flowers do fade, and wanton fields To wayward winter reckoning yield: A honey tongue, a heart of gall, Is fancies spring, but sorrows fall. Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses, Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies, Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten, In folly ripe, in reason rotten. Thy belt of straw, and ivie buds, Thy coral clasps, and amber studs; All these in me no means can move To come to thee, and be thy love. But could youth last, and love still breed, Had joyes no date, nor age no need; Then those delights my mind might move To live with thee, and be thy love. XII. TITUS ANDRONICUS'S COMPLAINT. The reader has here an ancient ballad on the same subject as the play of Titus Andronicus, and it is probable that the one was borrowed from the other: but which of them was the original, it is not easy to decide. And yet, if the argument offered above in p. 207 for the priority of the ballad of the Jew of Venice may be admitted, somewhat of the same kind may be urged here; for this ballad differs from the play in several particulars, which a simple Ballad-writer would be less likely to alter than an inventive Tragedian. Thus in the ballad is no mention of the contest for the empire between the two brothers, the composing of which makes the ungrateful treatment of Titus afterwards the more flagrant: neither is there any notice taken of his sacrificing one of Tamora's sons, which the tragic poet has assigned as the original cause of all her cruelties. In the play Titus loses twenty-one of his sons in war, and kills another for assisting Bassianus to carry off Lavinia: the reader will find it different in the ballad. In the latter she is betrothed to the Emperor's Son: in the play to his Brother. In the tragedy only Two of his sons fall into the pit, and the Third being banished returns to Rome with a victorious army, to avenge the wrongs of his house: in the ballad all Three are entrapped and suffer death. In the scene the Emperor kills Titus, and is in return stabbed by Titus's surviving son. Here Titus kills the Emperor, and afterwards himself. Let the Reader weigh these circumstances and some others wherein he will find them unlike, and then pronounce for himself. —After all, there is reason to conclude that this play was rather improved by Shakespeare with a few fine touches of his pen, than originally writ by him; for not to mention that the style is less figurative than his others generally are, this tragedy is mentioned with discredit in the Induction to Ben Jonson's Bartholomew-fair, in 1614, as one that had then been exhibited “five and twenty, or thirty years:” which, if we take the lowest number, throws it back to the year 1589, at which time Shakespeare was but 25: an earlier date, than can be found for any other of his pieces The earliest known, is King John in two parts 1591. 4to. bl. let. This play be afterwards entirely new wrote, as we now have it.: and if it does not clear him entirely of it, shews at least it was a first attempt. The following is given from a Copy in “The Golden Garland” intitled as above; compared with three others, two of them in black letter in the Pepys Collection, intitled “The Lamentable and Tragical History of Titus Andronicus, &amp;c.—To the tune of Fortune.”—Unluckily none of these have any dates. You noble minds, and famous martiall wights, That in defence of native country fights, Give eare to me, that ten yeeres fought for Rome, Yet reapt disgrace at my returning home. In Rome I lived in fame fulle threescore yeeres, My name beloved was of all my peeres; Full five and twenty valiant sonnes I had, Whose forwarde vertues made their father glad. For when Romes foes their warlike forces bent, Against them stille my sonnes and I were sent; Against the Goths full ten yeeres weary warre We spent, receiving many a bloudy scarre. Just two and twenty of my sonnes were slaine Before we did returne to Rome againe: Of five and twenty sonnes, I brought but three Alive, the stately towers of Rome to see. When wars were done, I conquest home did bring, And did present my prisoners to the king, The queene of Goths, her sons, and eke a moore, Which did such murders, like was nere before. The emperour did make this queene his wife, Which bred in Rome debate and deadlie strife; The moore, with her two sonnes did growe soe proud, That none like them in Rome might bee allowd. The moore soe pleas'd this new-made empress' eie, That she consented to him secretlye For to abuse her husbands marriage bed, And soe in time a blackamore she bred. Then she, whose thoughts to murder were inclinde, Consented with the moore of bloody minde Against myselfe, my kin, and all my friendes, In cruell sort to bring them to their endes, Soe when in age I thought to live in peace, Both care and griefe began then to increase: Amongst my sonnes I had one daughter bright, Which joy'd, and pleased best my aged sight: My deare Lavinia was betrothed than To Cesars sonne, a young and noble man: Who in a hunting by the emperours wife, And her two sonnes, bereaved was of life. He being slaine, was cast in cruel wise, Into a darksome den from light of skies: The cruell moore did come that way as then With my three sonnes, who fell into the den. The moore then fetcht the emperour with speed, For to accuse them of that murderous deed; And when my sonnes within the den were found, In wrongfull prison they were cast and bound. But nowe, behold! what wounded most my mind, The empresses two sonnes of savage kind My daughter ravished without remorse, And took away her honour, quite perforce. When they had tasted of soe sweete a flowre, Fearing this sweete should shortly turne to sowre, They cutt her tongue, whereby she could not tell How that dishonoure unto her befell. Then both her hands they basely cutt off quite, Whereby their wickednesse she could not write; Nor with her needle on her sampler sowe The bloudye workers of her direfull woe. My brother Marcus found her in the wood, Staining the grassie ground with purple bloud, That trickled from her stumpes, and bloudlesse armes: Noe tongue at all she had to tell her harmes. But when I sawe her in that woefull case, With teares of bloud I wet mine aged face: For my Lavinia I lamented more, Then for my two and twenty sonnes before. When as I sawe she could not write nor speake, With griefe mine aged heart began to breake; We spred an heape of sand upon the ground, Whereby those bloudy tyrants out we found. For with a staffe without the helpe of hand, She writt these wordes upon the plat of sand: “The lustfull sonnes of the proud emperèsse “Are doers of this hateful wickednèsse.” I tore the milk-white hairs from off mine head, I curst the houre, wherein I first was bred, I wisht this hand, that fought for countrie's fame, In cradle rockt, had first been stroken lame. The moore delighting still in villainy, Did say, to sett my sonnes from prison free I should unto the king my right hand give, And then my three imprisoned sonnes should live. The moore I caus'd to strike it off with speede, Whereat I grieved not to see it bleed, But for my sonnes would willingly impart, And for their ransome send my bleeding heart. But as my life did linger thus in paine, They sent to me my bootlesse hand againe, And therewithal the heades of my three sonnes, Which filld my dying heart with fresher moanes. Then past reliefe I upp and downe did goe, And with my tears writ in the dust my woe: I shot my arrowes If the ballad was written before the play, I should suppose this to be only a metaphorical expression, taken from that in the Psalms, “They shoot out their arrows, even bitter words.” Ps. 64. 3. towards heaven hie, And for revenge to hell did often crye. The empresse then, thinking that I was mad, Like furies she and both her sonnes were clad, (She nam'd Revenge, and Rape and Murder they) To undermine and heare what I would say. I fed their foolish veines i. e. encouraged them in their foolish humours, or fancies. a certaine space, Untill my friendes did find a secret place, Where both her sonnes unto a post were bound, And just revenge in cruell sort was found. I cut their throates, my daughter held the pan Betwixt her stumpes, wherein the bloud it ran: And then I ground their bones to powder small, And made a paste for pyes streight therewithall. Then with their fleshe I made two mighty pyes, And at a banquet servde in stately wise: Before the empresse set this loathsome meat; So of her sonnes own flesh she well did eat. Myselfe bereav'd my daughter then of life, The empresse then I slewe with bloudy knife, And stabb'd the emperour immediatelie, And then myself: even soe did Titus die. Then this revenge against the Moore was found, Alive they sett him halfe into the ground, Whereas he stood untill such time he starv'd. And soe God send all murderers may be serv'd. XIII. TAKE THOSE LIPS AWAY. The first stanza of this little sonnet, which an eminent critic Bp. Warb. in his Shakesp. justly admires for its extreme sweetness, is found in Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, A. 4. sc. 1. Both the stanzas are preserved in Beaum. and Fletcher's Bloody Brother, A. 5. sc. 2. Sewel and Gildon have printed it among Shakespeare's smaller Poems, but they have done the same by twenty other pieces that were never writ by him; their book being a wretched heap of inaccuracies and mistakes. It is not found in Jaggard's old edition of Shakespear's Sonnets reprinted by Lintot. Take, oh take those lips away, That so sweetlye were forsworne; And those eyes, the breake of day, Lights, that do misleade the morne: But my kisses bring againe, Seales of love, but seal'd in vaine. Hide, oh hide those hills of snowe, Which thy frozen bosom beares, On whose tops the pinkes that growe, Are of those that April wears: But first set my poor heart free, Bound in those icy chains by thee. XIV. KING LEIR AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS. The Reader has here an ancient ballad on the Subject of King Lear, which (as a sensible female critic has well observed Shakespear illustrated, Vol. 3. p. 302.) bears so exact an analogy to the argument of Shakespeare's play, that his having copied it could not be doubted, if it were certain, that it was written before the tragedy. Here is found the hint of Lear's madness, which the old chronicles See Jeffery of Monmouth, Holingshed, &amp;c. who relate Leir's history in many respects the same as the ballad. do not mention, as also the extravagant cruelty exercised on him by his daughters: In the death of Lear they likewise very exactly coincide.—The misfortune is, that there is nothing to assist us in ascertaining the date of the ballad but what little evidence arises from within; this the Reader must weigh and judge for himself. It may be proper to observe, that Shakespeare was not the first of our Dramatic Poets who fitted the Story of LEIR to the Stage. His first 4to Edition is dated 1608; but three years before that had been printed a play intitled, “The true Chronicle History of Leir and his three daughters Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella, as it hath been divers and sundry times lately acted. 1605. 4to.”—This is a very poor and dull performance, but happily excited Shakespeare to undertake the subject, which he has given with very different incidents. It is remarkable, that neither the circumstances of Leir's madness; nor his retinue of a select number of knights; nor the affecting deaths of Cordelia and Leir, are found in that first dramatic piece: in all which Shakespeare concurs with this ballad. But to form a true Judgment of Shakespeare's Merit, the curious Reader should cast his eye over that previous Sketch: which he will find printed at the end of the Twenty Plays of Shakespeare, republished from the quarto impressions by George Steevens, Esq; with such elegance and exactness, as lead us to expect a fine edition of all the works of our great Dramatic Poet. The following Ballad is given from an ancient copy in the “Golden Garland,” bl. let. intitled, “A lamentable song of the Death of King Leir, and his three daughters. To the Tune of When flying fame.” King Leir once ruled in this land, With princely power and peace; And had all things with hearts content, That might his joys increase. Amongst those things that nature gave, Three daughters fair had he, So princely seeming beautiful, As fairer could not be. So on a time it pleas'd the king A question thus to move, Which of his daughters to his grace Could shew the dearest love: For to my age you bring content; Quoth he, then let me hear Which of you three in plighted troth The kindest will appear. To whom the eldest thus began; Dear father, mind, quoth she, Before your face, to do you good, My blood shall render'd be: And for your sake my bleeding heart Shall here be cut in twain, Ere that I see your reverend age The smallest grief sustain. And so will I, the second said; Dear father, for your sake, The worst of all extremities I'll gently undertake: And serve your highness night and day With diligence and love; That sweet content and quietness Discomforts may remove. In doing so, you glad my soul, The aged king reply'd; But what sayst thou, my youngest girl, How is thy love ally'd? My love (quoth young Cordelia then) Which to your grace I owe, Shall be the duty of a child, And that is all I'll show. And wilt thou shew no more, quoth he, Than doth thy duty bind? I well perceive thy love is small, When as no more I find: Henceforth I banish thee my court, Thou art no child of mine; Nor any part of this my realm By favour shall be thine. Thy elder sisters loves are more Than well I can demand, To whom I equally bestow My kingdome and my land, My pompal state and all my goods, That lovingly I may With those thy sisters be maintain'd Until my dying day. Thus flattering speeches won renown, By these two sisters here: The third had causeless banishment, Yet was her love more dear: For poor Cordelia patiently Went wandring up and down, Unhelp'd, unpity'd, gentle maid, Through many an English town: Untill at last in famous France She gentler fortunes found; Though poor and bare, yet she was deem'd The fairest on the ground: Where when the king her virtues heard, And this fair lady seen, With full consent of all his court He made his wife and queen. Her father ‘old’ king Lear this while With his two daughters staid; Forgetful of their promis'd loves, Full soon the same decay'd; And living in queen Ragan's court, The eldest of the twain, She took from him his chiefest means, And most of all his train. For whereas twenty men were wont To wait with bended knee: She gave allowance but to ten, And after scarce to three: Nay, one she thought too much for him, So took she all away, In hope that in her court, good king, He would no longer stay. Am I rewarded thus, quoth he, In giving all I have Unto my children, and to beg For what I lately gave? I'll go unto my Gonorell; My second child, I know, Will be more kind and pitiful, And will relieve my woe. Full fast he hies then to her court; Where when she heard his moan Return'd him answer, That she griev'd, That all his means were gone: But no way could relieve his wants; Yet if that he would stay Within her kitchen, he should have What scullions gave away. When he had heard, with bitter tears, He made his answer then; In what I did let me be made Example to all men. I will return again, quoth he, Unto my Ragan's court; She will not use me thus, I hope, But in a kinder sort. Where when he came, she gave command To drive him thence away: When he was well within her court (She said) he would not stay. Then back again to Gonorell, The woeful king did hie, That in her kitchen he might have What scullion boys set by. But there of that he was deny'd, Which she had promis'd late: For once refusing, he should not Come after to her gate. Thus twixt his daughters, for relief He wandred up and down; Being glad to feed on beggars food, That lately wore a crown. And calling to remembrance then His youngest daughters words, That said the duty of a child Was all that love affords: But doubting to repair to her, Whom he had banish'd so, Grew frantick mad; for in his mind He bore the wounds of woe: Which made him rend his milk-white locks, And tresses from his head, And all with blood bestain his cheeks, With age and honour spread: To hills and woods and watry founts, He made his hourly moan, Till hills and woods, and sensless things, Did seem to sigh and groan. Even thus possest with discontents, He passed o're to France, In hopes from fair Cordelia there, To find some gentler chance: Most virtuous dame! which when she heard Of this her father's grief, As duty bound, she quickly sent Him comfort and relief: And by a train of noble peers, In brave and gallant sort, She gave in charge he should be brought To Aganippus' court; Whose royal king, with noble mind So freely gave consent, To muster up his knights at arms, To fame and courage bent. And so to England came with speed, To repossesse king Leir, And drive his daughters from their thrones By his Cordelia dear: Where she, true-hearted noble queen, Was in the battel slain: Yet he good king, in his old days, Possest his crown again. But when he heard Cordelia's death, Who died indeed for love Of her dear father, in whose cause She did this battel move; He swooning fell upon her breast, From whence he never parted: But on her bosom left his life, That was so truly hearted. The lords and nobles when they saw The end of these events, The other sisters unto death They doomed by consents: And being dead, their crowns they left Unto the next of kin: Thus have you seen the fall of pride, And disobedient sin. XV. YOUTH AND AGE —is found in the little collection of Shakespeare's Sonnets, intitled the passionate Pilgrime See above, page 217., the greatest part of which seem to relate to the amours of Venus and Adonis, being little effusions of fancy, probably written, while he was composing his larger Poem on that subject. The following seems intended for the mouth of Venus, weighing the comparative merits of youthful Adonis and aged Vulcan. In the “Garland of good will” it is reprinted, with the addition of IV. more such stanzas, but evidently written by a meaner pen. Crabbed Age and Youth Cannot live together; Youth is full of pleasance, Age is full of care: Youth like summer morn, Age like winter weather, Youth like summer brave, Age like winter bare: Youth is full of sport, Ages breath is short; Youth is nimble, Age is lame: Youth is hot and bold, Age is weak and cold; Youth is wild, and Age is tame. Age, I do abhor thee, Youth, I do adore thee, O, my love, my love is young: Age, I do defie thee; Oh sweet shepheard, hie thee, For methinks thou stayst too long. XVI. THE FROLICKSOME DUKE, OR THE TINKER's GOOD FORTUNE. The following ballad is upon the same subject, as the Induction to Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew: whether it may be thought to have suggested the hint to the Dramatic poet, or is not rather of later date, the reader must determine. The story is told By Ludov. Vives in Epist. &amp; by Pont. Heuter. Rerum Burgund. lib. 4. of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy; and is thus related by an old English writer. “The said Duke, at the marriage of Eleonora, sister to the king of Portugall, at Bruges in Flanders, which was solemnised in the deepe of winter; when as by reason of unseasonable weather he could neither hawke nor hunt, and was now tired with cards, dice, &amp;c. and such other domestick sports, or to see ladies dance; with some of his courtiers, he would in the evening walke disguised all about the towne. It so fortuned, as he was walking late one night, he found a countrey fellow dead drunke, snorting on a bulke; he caused his followers to bring him to his palace, and there stripping him of his old clothes, and attyring him after the court fashion, when he wakened, he and they were all ready to attend upon his excellency, and persuade him that he was some great Duke. The poor fellow admiring how he came there, was served in state all day long: after supper he saw them dance, heard musicke, and all the rest of those court-like pleasures: but late at night, when he was well tipled, and again fast asleepe, they put on his old robes, and so conveyed him to the place, where they first found him. Now the fellow had not made them so good sport the day before, as he did now, when he returned to himself: all the jest was to see how he looked upon it. In conclusion, after some little admiration, the poore man told his friends he had seen a vision; constantly believed it; would not otherwise be persuaded, and so the jest ended.” Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. Pt. 2. sect. 2. Memb. 4. 2d. Ed. 1624. fol. This ballad is given from a black letter Copy in the Pepys Collection, which is intitled as above, “To the tune of, Fond boy.” Now as fame does report a young duke keeps a court, One that pleases his fancy with frolicksome sport: But amongst all the rest, here is one I protest, Which will make you to smile when you hear the true jest: A poor tinker he found, lying drunk on the ground, As secure in a sleep as if laid in a swound. The duke said to his men, William, Richard, and Ben, Take him home to my palace, we'll sport with him then. O'er a horse he was laid, and with care soon convey'd To the palace, altho' he was poorly arrai'd: Then they stript off his cloaths, both his shirt, shoes and hose, And they put him to bed for to take his repose. Having pull'd off his shirt, which was all over durt, They did give him clean holland, this was no great hurt: On a bed of soft down, like a lord of renown, They did lay him to sleep the drink out of his crown. In the morning when day, then admiring he lay, For to see the rich chamber both gaudy and gay. Now he lay something late, in his rich bed of state, Till at last knights and squires they on him did wait; And the chamberling bare, then did likewise declare, He desir'd to know what apparel he'd ware: The poor tinker amaz'd, on the gentleman gaz'd, And admired how he to this honour was rais'd. Tho' he seem'd something mute, yet he chose a rich suit, Which he straitways put on without longer dispute; With a star on his side, which the tinker offt ey'd, And it seem'd for to swell him ‘no’ little with pride; For he said to himself, Where is Joan my sweet wife? Sure she never did see me so fine in her life. From a convenient place, the right duke his good grace Did observe his behaviour in every case. To a garden of state, on the tinker they wait, Trumpets sounding before him: thought he, this is great: Where an hour or two, pleasant walks he did view, With commanders and squires in scarlet and blew. A fine dinner was drest, both for him and his guests, He was plac'd at the table above all the rest, In a rich chair ‘or bed,’ lin'd with fine crimson red, With a rich golden canopy over his head: As he sat at his meat, the musick play'd sweet, With the choicest of singing his joys to compleat. While the tinker did dine, he had plenty of wine, Rich canary with sherry and tent superfine. Like a right honest soul, faith, he took off his bowl, Till at last he began for to tumble and roul From his chair to the floor, where he sleeping did snore, Being seven times drunker then ever before. Then the duke did ordain, they should strip him amain, And restore him his old leather garments again: 'Twas a point next the worst, yet perform it they must, And they carry'd him strait, where they found him at first; Then he slept all the night, as indeed well he might; But when he did waken, his joys took their flight. For his glory ‘to him’ so pleasant did seem, That he thought it to be but a meer golden dream; Till at length he was brought to the duke, where he sought For a pardon, as fearing he had set him at nought; But his highness he said, Thou'rt a jolly bold blade, Such a frolick before I think never was plaid. Then his highness bespoke him a new suit and cloak, Which he gave for the sake of this frolicksome joak; Nay, and five hundred pound, with ten acres of ground, Thou shalt never, said he, range the counteries round, Crying old brass to mend, for I'll be thy good friend, Nay, and Joan thy sweet wife shall my duchess attend. Then the tinker reply'd, What! must Joan my sweet bride Be a lady in chariots of pleasure to ride? Must we have gold and land ev'ry day at command? Then I shall be a squire I well understand: Well I thank your good grace, and your love I embrace, I was never before in so happy a case. XVII. THE FRIAR OF ORDERS GRAY. Dispersed thro' Shakespeare's plays are innumerable little fragments of ancient ballads, the entire copies of which could not be recovered. Many of these being of the most beautiful and pathetic simplicity, the Editor was tempted to select some of them, and with a few supplemental stanzas to connect them together, and form them into a little tale, which is here submitted to the Reader's candour. One small fragment was taken from Beaumont and Fletcher. It was a friar of orders gray Walkt forth to tell his beades; And he met with a lady faire Clad in a pilgrime's weedes. Now Christ thee save, thou reverend friar, I pray thee tell to me, If ever at yon holy shrine My true love thou didst see. And how should I know your true love From many another one? O by his cockle hat, and staff, And by his sandal shoone These are the distinguishing marks of a Pilgrim. The chief places of devotion being beyond sea, the pilgrims were wont to put cockle-shells in their hats to denote the intention or performance of their devotion. Warb. Shakespe Vol. 8. p. 224.. But chiefly by his face and mien, That were so fair to view; His flaxen locks that sweetly curl'd, And eyne of lovely blue. O lady, he is dead and gone! Lady, he's dead and gone! And at his head a green grass turfe, And at his heels a stone. Within these holy cloysters long He languisht, and he dyed, Lamenting of a ladyes love, And 'playning of her pride. Here bore him barefac'd on his bier Six proper youths and tall, And many a tear bedew'd his grave Within yon kirk-yard wall. And art thou dead, thou gentle youth! And art thou dead and gone! And didst thou dye for love of me! Break, cruel heart of stone! O weep not, lady, weep not soe; Some ghostly comfort seek: Let not vain sorrow rive thy heart, Ne teares bedew thy cheek. O do not, do not, holy friar, My sorrow now reprove; For I have lost the sweetest youth, That e'er wan ladyes love. And nowe, alas! for thy sad losse, I'll evermore weep and sigh; For thee I only wisht to live, For thee I wish to dye. Weep no more, lady, weep no more, Thy sorrowe is in vaine: For violets pluckt the sweetest showers Will ne'er make grow againe. Our joys as winged dreams doe flye, Why then should sorrow last? Since grief but aggravates thy losse, Grieve not for what is past. O say not soe, thou holy friar; I pray thee, say not soe: For since my true-love dyed for mee, 'Tis meet my tears should flow. And will he ne'er come again? Will he ne'er come again? Ah! no, he is dead and laid in his grave, For ever to remain. His cheek was redder than the rose; The comliest youth was he!— But he is dead and laid in his grave: Alas, and woe is me! Sigh no more, lady, sigh no more, Men were deceivers ever: One foot on sea and one on land, To one thing constant never. Hadst thou been fond, he had been false, And left thee sad and heavy; For young men ever were fickle found, Since summer trees were leafy. Now say not so, thou holy friar, I pray thee say not soe: My love he had the truest heart: O he was ever true! And art thou dead, thou much-lov'd youth, And didst thou dye for mee? Then farewell home; for ever-more A pilgrim I will bee. But first upon my true-loves grave My weary limbs I'll lay, And thrice I'll kiss the green-grass turf, That wraps his breathless clay. Yet stay, fair lady; rest awhile Beneath this cloyster wall: See through the hawthorn blows the cold wind, And drizzly rain doth fall. O stay me not, thou holy friar; O stay me not I pray; No drizzly rain that falls on me, Can wash my fault away. Yet stay, fair lady, turn again, And dry those pearly tears; For see beneath this gown of gray Thy owne true-love appears. Here forc'd by grief, and hopeless love, These holy weeds I sought; And here amid these lonely walls To end my days I thought. But haply for my year of grace The year of probation, or noviciate. Is not yet past away, Might I still hope to win thy love, No longer would I stay. Now farewell grief, and welcome joy Once more unto my heart: For since I have found thee, lovely youth, We never more will part. THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. I. THE MORE MODERN BALLAD OF CHEVY CHACE. At the beginning of this volume we gave the old original Song of Chevy Chace. The reader has here the more improved edition of that fine Heroic ballad. It will afford an agreeable entertainment to the curious to compare them together, and to see how far the latter bard has excelled his predecessor, and where he has fallen short of him. For tho' he has every where improved the versification, and generally the sentiment and diction: yet some few passages retain more dignity in the ancient copy; at least the obsoleteness of the style serves as a veil to hide whatever might appear too familiar or vulgar in them. Thus, for instance, the catastrophe of the gallant Witherington is in the modern copy exprest in terms which never fail at present to excite ridicule: whereas in the original it is related with a plain and pathetic simplicity, that is liable to no such unlucky effect: See the stanza in pag. 241 which in modern orthography, &amp;c. would run thus, “For Witherington my heart is woe, “That ever he slain should be: “For when his legs were hewn in two, “He knelt and fought on his knee.” So again the stanza which describes the fall of Montgomery is somewhat more elevated in the ancient copy, “The dint it was both sad and sore, “He on Montgomery set: “The swan-feathers his arrow bore “With his hearts blood were wet.” WE might also add, that the circumstances of the battle are more clearly conceived, and the several incidents more distinctly marked in the old original, than in the improved copy. It is well known that the ancient English weapon was the long bow, and that this nation excelled all others in archery; while the Scottish warriours chiefly depended on the use of the spear: this characteristic difference never escapes our ancient bard, whose description of the first onset (p. 9.) is to the following effect. “The proposal of the two gallant earls to determine the dispute by single combat being over-ruled; the English, says he, who stood with their bows ready bent, gave a general discharge of their arrows, which slew seven score spearmen of the enemy: but notwithstanding so severe a loss, Douglas like a brave captain kept his ground. He had divided his forces into three columns, who as soon as the English had discharged the first volley, bore down upon them with their spears, and breaking through their ranks reduced them to close fighting. The archers upon this dropt their bows and had recourse to their swords, and there followed so sharp a conflict, that multitudes on both sides lost their lives.” In the midst of this general engagement, at length the two great earls meet, and after a spirited rencounter agree to breathe; upon which a parley ensues, that would do honour to Homer himself. Nothing can be more pleasingly distinct and circumstantial than this: whereas the modern copy, tho' in general it has great merit, is here unluckily both confused and obscure. Indeed the original words seem here to have been totally misunderstood. “Yet bydys the yerl Douglas upon the bent,” evidently signifies, “Yet the earl Douglas abides in the field:” Whereas the more modern bard seems to have understood by bent, the inclination of his mind, and accordingly runs quite off from the subject In the present Edition, instead of the unmeaning lines here censured, an insertion is made of four Stanzas modernized from the ancient Copy., “To drive the deer with hound and horn “Earl Douglas had the bent.” ONE may also observe a generous impartiality in the old original bard, when in the conclusion of his tale he represents both nations as quitting the field without any reproachful reflection on either: tho' he gives to his own countrymen the credit of being the smaller number. “Of fifteen hundred archers of England “Went away but fifty and three; “Of twenty hundred spearmen of Scotland, “But even five and fifty.” He attributes flight to neither party, as hath been done in the modern copies of this ballad, as well Scotch as English. For, to be even with our latter bard, who makes the Scots to flee, some reviser of North Britain has turned his own arms against him, and printed an Edition at Glasgow, in which the lines are thus transposed, “Of fifteen hundred Scottish speirs “Went hame but fifty-three: “Of twenty hundred Englishmen “Scarce fifty-five did flee.” And to countenance this change he has suppressed the two stanzas between ver. 241. and ver. 249.—From this Edition I have reformed the Scottish names in pag. 263. which in the modern English ballad appeared to be corrupted. When I call the present admired ballad modern, I only mean that it is comparatively so; for that it could not be writ much later than the time of Q. Elizabeth, I think may be made appear; nor yet does it seem to be older than the beginning of the last century A late Writer has started a notion that the more modern Copy “was written to be sung by a party of English, headed by a Douglas in the year 1524; which is the true reason, why at the same time that it gives the advantage to the English Soldiers above the Scotch, it gives yet so lovely and so manifestly superior a Character to the Scotch Commander above the English.” See Say's Essay on the Numbers of Paradise Lost, 4to. 1745. p. 167. This appears to me a groundless conjecture: the language seems too modern for the date above-mentioned; and had it been printed even so early as Queen Elizabeth's reign, I think I should have met with some copy wherein the first line would have been, God prosper long our noble queen, as was the case with the Blind Beggar of Bednal Green; see the next Volume, p. 160.. Sir Philip Sidney, when he complains of the antiquated phrase of Chevy Chace, could never have seen this improved copy, the language of which is not more ancient than that he himself used. It is probable that the encomiums of so admired a writer excited some bard to revise the ballad, and to free it from those faults he had objected to it. That it could not be much later than that time, appears from the phrase doleful dumps; which in that age carried no ill sound with it, but to the next generation became ridiculous. We have seen it pass uncensured in a sonnet that was at that time in request, and where it could not fail to have been taken notice of, had it been in the least exceptionable: see above p. 180, 1: Yet in about half a century after, it was become burlesque. See Hudibras, Pt. 1. c. 3. v. 95. THIS much premised, the reader that would see the general beauties of this ballad set in a just and striking light, may consult the excellent criticism of Mr. Addison In the Spectator, No. 70. 74.. With regard to its subject: it has already been considered in page 3d. The conjectures there offered will receive confirmation from a passage in the Memoirs of Cary Earl of Monmouth, 8 vo. 1759. p. 165. Whence we learn that it was an ancient custom with the borderers of the two kingdoms when they were at peace, to send to the Lord Wardens of the opposite Marches for leave to hunt within their districts. If leave was granted, then towards the end of summer they would come and hunt for several days together “with their grey-hounds for deer:” but if they took this liberty unpermitted, then the Lord Warden of the border so invaded, would not fail to interrupt their sport and chastise their boldness. He mentions a remarkable instance that happened while he was Warden, when some Scotch Gentlemen coming to hunt in defiance of him, there must have ensued such an action as this of Chevy Chace, if the intruders had been proportionably numerous and well-armed; for upon their being attacked by his men at arms, he tells us, “some hurt was done, tho' “he had given especiall order that they should shed as little blood as possible.” They were in effect overpowered and taken prisoners, and only released on their promise to abstain from such licentious sporting for the future. The following text is given from a copy in the Editor's folio MS. compared with two or three others printed in black letter.—In the second volume of Dryden's Miscellanies may be found a translation of Chevy Chace into Latin Rhymes. The translator, Mr. Henry Bold of New College, undertook it at the command of Dr. Compton, bishop of London; who thought it no derogation to his episcopal character, to avow a fondness for this excellent old ballad. See the preface to Bold's Latin Songs, 1685. 8 vo. God prosper long our noble king, Our lives and safetyes all; A woful hunting once there did In Chevy-Chace befall; To drive the deere with hound and horne, Earl Percy took his way; The child may rue that is unborne, The hunting of that day. The stout Earl of Northumberland A vow to God did make, His pleasure in the Scottish woods Three summers days to take; The cheefest harts in Chevy Chace To kill and beare away. These tydings to Earl Douglas came, In Scotland where he lay: Who sent Earl Percy present word, He wold prevent his sport. The English earl, not fearing this, Did to the woods resort With fifteen hundred bow-men bold; All chosen men of might, Who knew full well in time of neede To aime their shafts aright. The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran, To chase the fallow deere: On Monday they began to hunt, Ere day-light did appeare; And long before high noone they had An hundred fat buckes slaine; Then having din'd, the drovers went To rouze them up againe. The bow-men mustered on the hills, Well able te endure; Theire backsides all, with speciall care, That day were guarded sure. The hounds ran swiftly through the woods, The nimble deere to take The Chiviot Hills and circumjacent Wastes are at present void both of Deer and Woods: but formerly they had enough of both to justify the Descriptions attempted here and in the Ancient Ballad of Chevy-Chace. Leyland, in the reign of Hen. VIII. thus describes this County:—“In Northumberland, as I heare say, be no Forests, except Chivet Hills; where is much Brushe-Wood, and some Okke; Grownde ovargrowne with Linge, and some with Mosse. I have harde say that Chivet Hilles stretchethe xx miles. There is greate Plenté of Redde-Dere, and Roo Bukkes.” Itin. vol. 7. pag. 56.—This passage, which did not occur when pag. 22. 24. were printed off, confirm the accounts there given of the Stagge and the Roe., And with their cryes the hills and dales An echo shrill did make. Lord Percy to the quarry went, To view the slaughter'd deere; Quoth he, Earl Douglas promised This day to meete me here: But if I thought he would not come, No longer wold I stay. With that, a brave younge gentleman Thus to the earle did say: Loe, yonder doth Earl Douglas come, His men in armour bright; Full twenty hundred Scottish speares All marching in our sight; All men of pleasant Tivydale, Fast by the river Tweede: Then cease your sport, Earl Percy said, And take your bowes with speede: And now with me, my countrymen, Your courage forth advance; For never was there champion yet, In Scotland or in France, That ever did on horsebacke come, But if my hap it were, I durst encounter man for man, With him to break a speare. Earl Douglas on a milke-white steede, Most like a baron bold, Rode foremost of his company, Whose armour shone like gold: Show me, sayd he, whose men you bee, That hunt soe boldly heere, That, without my consent, doe chase And kill my fallow-deere? The man that first did answer make, Was noble Percy hee; Who sayd, We list not to declare, Nor shew whose men wee bee: Yet will wee spend our deerest blood, Thy cheefest harts to slay. Then Douglas swore a solemne oathe, And thus in rage did say, Ere thus I will out-braved bee, One of us two shall dye: I know thee well, an earl thou art; Lord Percy, so am I. But trust me, Percy, pittye it were, And great offence to kill Any of these our harmlesse men, For they have done no ill. Let thou and I the battell trye, And set our men aside. Accurs'd bee hee, Lord Percy sayd, By whome this is denyed. Then stept a gallant squire forth, Witherington was his name, Who said, I wold not have it told To Henry our king for shame, That e'er my captaine fought on foote, And I stood looking on. You bee two earls, sayd Witherington, And I a squire alone: Ile doe the best that doe I may, While I have power to stand: While I have pow'r to weeld my sword, Ile fight with heart and hand. Our English archers bent their bowes, Their hearts were good and trew; At the first flight of arrowes sent, Full threescore Scots they slew. The 4 stanzas here inclosed in Brackets, which are borrowed chiefly from the ancient Copy, are offered to the Reader instead of the following unmeaning lines, which are those of the Author, viz. To drive the deere with hound and horne, Earl Douglas had the bent; Two captaines mov'd with mickle pride, Their speares to shivers went. [Yet bides Earl Douglas on the bent, As Chieftain stout and good. As valiant Captain, all unmov'd The shock he firmly stood. His host he parted had in three, As Leader ware and try'd, And soon his spearmen on their foes Bare down on every side. Throughout the English archery They dealt full many a wound: But still our valiant Englishmen All firmly kept their ground: And throwing strait their bows away, They grasp'd their swords so bright: And now sharp blows, a heavy shower, On shields and helmets light.] They clos'd full fast on ever ye side, Noe slackness there was found; And many a gallant gentleman Lay gasping on the ground. O Christ! it was a griefe to see, And likewise for to heare, The cries of men lying in their gore, And scattered here and there. At last these two stout earles did meet, Like captaines of great might: Like lyons wood, they layd on load, And made a cruell fight: They fought untill they both did sweat, With swords of temper'd steele; Until the blood, like drops of rain, They trickling down did feele. Yeeld thee, Lord Percy, Douglas sayd; In faith I will thee bring, Where thou shalt high advanced bee By James our Scottish king: Thy ransome I will freely give, And thus report of thee, Thou art the most couragious knight, That ever I did see. Noe, Douglas, quoth Earl Percy then, Thy proffer I doe scorne; I will not yeelde to any Scott, That ever yet was borne. With that, there came an arrow keene Out of an English bow, Which strucke Earl Douglas to the heart, A deepe and deadlye blow: Who never spoke more words than these, Fight on, my merry men all; For why, my life is at an end; Lord Percy sees my fall. Then leaving life, Earl Percy tooke The dead man by the hand; And said, Earl Douglas, for thy life Wold I had lost my land. O Christ! my very heart doth bleed With sorrow for thy sake; For sure, a more renowned knight Mischance did never take. A knight amongst the Scotts there was, Which saw Earl Douglas dye, Who streight in wrath did vow revenge Upon the Lord Percy: Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he call'd, Who, with a speare most bright, Well-mounted on a gallant steed, Ran fiercely through the fight; And past the English archers all, Without all dread or feare; And thro' Earl Percy's body then He thrust his hatefull speare; With such a vehement force and might He did his body gore, The speare went through the other side A large cloth-yard, and more. So thus did both these nobles dye, Whose courage none could staine: An English archer then perceiv'd The noble earl was slaine; He had a bow bent in his hand, Made of a trusty tree; An arrow of a cloth-yard long Up to the head drew hee: Against Sir Hugh Mountgomery, So right the shaft he sett, The grey goose-wing that was thereon, In his hearts blood was wett. This fight did last from breake of day, Till setting of the sun; For when they rung the evening-bell Sc. the Curfew bell, usually rung at 8 o'clock., The battel scarce was done. With brave Earl Percy, there was slaine Sir John of Egerton THE surnames in the foregoing Ballad are altered, either by accident or design, from the old original Copy, and in common Editions extremely corrupted. They are here rectified, as much as they could be. Thus, This name is restored (instead of Ogerton, com. Ed.) from the Editor's folio MS. The pieces in that MS. appear to have been collected, and many of them composed (among which might be this ballad) by an inhabitant of Cheshire; who was willing to pay a Compliment here to one of his countrymen, of the eminent Family De or Of Egerton (so the name was first written) ancestors of the present Duke of Bridgwater: and this he could do with the more propriety, as the Percies had formerly great interest in that county: At the fatal battle of Shrewsbury all the flower of the Cheshire gentlemen lost their lives fighting in the cause of Hotspur., Sir Robert Ratcliff This was a family much distinguished in Northumberland. Edw. Radcliffe, mil. was sheriff of that county in 17 of Hen. 7. and others of the same surname afterwards. (See Fuller, p. 313.) Sir George Ratcliff, Knt. was one of the commissioners of inclosure in 1552. (See Nicholson, p. 330.)—Of this family was the late Earl of Derwentwater, who was beheaded in 1715. The Editor's folio MS. however, reads here, Sir Robert Harcliffe and Sir William. The Harcleys were an eminent family in Cumberland. See Fuller p. 224. Whether this may be thought to be the same name, I do not determine., and Sir John, Sir James that bold baròn This is apparently altered (not to say corrupted) from Hearon, in pag. 14. ver. 114.: And with Sir George and stout Sir James, Both knights of good account, Good Sir Ralph Raby This might be intended to celebrate one of the ancient possessors of Raby Castle in the county of Durham. Yet it is written Rebbye, in the fol. MS. and looks like a corruption of Rugby or Rokeby, an eminent family in Yorkshire, see p. 14, 33. It will not be wondered that the Percies should be thought to bring followers out of that county, where they themselves were originally seated, and had always such extensive property and influence. there was slaine, Whose prowesse did surmount. For Witherington needs must I wayle, As one in doleful dumpes i. e. “I, as one in deep concern, must lament.” The construction here has generally been misunderstood.; For when his legs were smitten off, He fought upon his stumpes. And with Earl Douglas, there was slaine Sir Hugh Mountgomery; Sir Charles Murray So the Scottish copy. In the com. edit. it is Carrel or Currel; and Morrell in the fol. MS., that from the feeld One foote would never flee. Sir Charles Murray So the Scot. edit.—The com. copies read Murrel. The fol. MS. gives the line in the following peculiar manner, “Sir Roger Heuer of Harcliffe too.”, of Ratcliff, too, His sisters sonne was hee; Sir David Lamb The folio MS. has “Sir David Lambwell, well esteemed. This seems evidently corrupted from Lwdale or Liddell, in the old copy, pag. 15, 33., so well esteem'd, Yet saved cold not be. And the Lord Maxwell in like case Did with Earl Douglas dye: Of twenty hundred Scottish speres, Scarce fifty-five did flye. Of fifteen hundred Englishmen, Went home but fifty-three; The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chase, Under the greene wood tree. Next day did many widowes come, Their husbands to bewayle; They washt their wounds in brinish teares, But all wold not prevayle. Their bodyes, bath'd in purple gore, They bare with them away: They kist them dead a thousand times, When they were cladd in clay. This newes was brought to Edenborrow, Where Scotlands king did raigne, That brave Earl Douglas suddenlye Was with an arrow slaine: O heavy newes, King James did say, Scotland can witnesse bee, I have not any captaine more Of such account as hee. Like tydings to King Henry came, Within as short a space, That Percy of Northumberland Was slaine in Chevy-Chase: Now God be with him, said our king, Sith it will no better bee; I trust I have, within my realme, Five hundred as good as hee: Yet shall not Scot nor Scotland say, But I will vengeance take: I'll be revenged on them all, For brave Earl Percy's sake. This vow full well the king perform'd After, at Humbledowne; In one day, fifty knights were slayne, With lords of great renowne: And of the rest, of small account, Did many thousands dye: Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chase, Made by the Earl Percy. God save the king, and bless this land In plentye, joy, and peace; And grant henceforth, that foule debate 'Twixt noblemen may cease. II. DEATH'S FINAL CONQUEST. These fine moral stanzas were originally intended for a solemn funeral song in a play of James Shirley's, intitled “The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses:” no date, 8vo.— Shirley flourished as a Dramatic writer early in the reign of Charles I: but he outlived the Restoration. His death happened Oct. 29. 1666. Æt. 72. This little poem was written long after many of those that follow, but is inserted here as a kind of Dirge to the foregoing piece. It is said to have been a favourite Song with K. Charles II. The glories of our blood and state Are shadows, not substantial things; There is no armour against fate: Death lays his icy hands on kings: Scepter and crown Must tumble down, And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade. Some men with swords may reap the field, And plant fresh laurels where they kill; But their strong nerves at last must yield, They tame but one another still. Early or late They stoop to fate, And must give up their murmuring breath, When they pale captives creep to death. The garlands wither on your brow, Then boast no more your mighty deeds, Upon death's purple altar now See where the victor victim bleeds: All heads must come To the cold tomb, Only the actions of the just Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust. III. THE RISING IN THE NORTH. The subject of this ballad is the great Northern Insurrection in the 12th year of Elizabeth, 1569; which proved so fatal to Thomas Percy the seventh Earl of Northumberland. There had not long before been a secret negotiation entered into between some of the Scottish and English nobility, to bring about a marriage between Mary Q. of Scots, at that time a prisoner in England, and the Duke of Norfolk, a nobleman of excellent character, and firmly attached to the Protestant religion. This match was proposed to all the most considerable of the English nobility, and among the rest to the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, two noblemen very powerful in the North. As it seemed to promise a speedy and safe conclusion of the troubles in Scotland, with many advantages to the crown of England; they all consented to it, provided it should prove agreeable to Q. Elizabeth. The Earl of Leicester (Elizabeth's favourite) undertook to break the matter to her, but before he could find an opportunity, the affair had come to her ears by other hands, and she was thrown into a violent flame. The Duke of Norfolk, with several of his friends, was committed to the tower, and summons were sent to the Northern Earls instantly to make their appearance at court. It is said that the Earl of Northumberland, who was a man of a mild and gentle nature, was deliberating with himself whether he should not obey the message, and rely upon the queen's candour and clemency, when he was forced into desperate measures by a sudden report at midnight, Nov. 14. that a party of his enemies were come to seize on his person This circumstance is overlooked in the ballad.. The Earl was then at his house at Topcliffe in Yorkshire. When rising hastily out of bed, he withdrew to the Earl of Westmoreland, at Brancepeth, where the country came in to them, and pressed them to take arms in their own defence. They accordingly set up their standards, declaring their intent was to restore the ancient religion; to get the succession of the crown firmly settled, and to prevent the destruction of the ancient nobility, &amp;c. Their common banner Besides this, the ballad mentions the separate banners of the two Noblemen. (on which was displayed the cross, together with the five wounds of Christ) was borne by an ancient gentleman, Richard Norton, Esq; of Norton-conyers: who with his sons (among whom, Christopher, Marmaduke, and Thomas, are expressly named by Camden) distinguished himself on this occasion. Having entered Durham, they tore the Bible, &amp;c. and caused mass to be said there: they then marched on to Clifford-moor near Wetherbye, where they mustered their men. Their intention was to have proceeded on to York, but altering their minds they fell upon Barnard's castle, which Sir George Bowes held out against them for eleven days. The two earls, who spent their large estates in hospitality, and were extremely beloved on that account, were masters of little ready money; the E. of Northumberland bringing with him only 8000 crowns, and the E. of Westmoreland nothing at all for the subsistence of their forces, they were not able to march to London, as they had at first intended. In these circumstances, Westmoreland began so visibly to despond that many of his men slunk away, tho' Northumberland still kept up his resolution, and was master of the field till December 13. when the Earl of Sussex, accompanied with Lord Hunsden and others, having marched out of York at the head of a large body of forces, and being followed by a still larger army under the command of Ambrose Dudley Earl of Warwick, the insurgents retreated northward towards the borders, and there dismissing their followers, made their escape into Scotland. Tho' this insurrection had been suppressed with so little bloodshed, the Earl of Sussex and Sir George Bowes, marshal of the army, put vast numbers to death by martial law, without any regular trial. The former of these caused at Durham sixty-three constables to be hanged at once. And the latter made his boast that for sixty miles in length and forty in breadth, betwixt Newcastle and Wetherby, there was hardly a town or village wherein he had not executed some of the inhabitants. This exceeds the cruelties practised in the West after Monmouth's rebellion: but that was not the age of tenderness and humanity. Such is the account collected from Stow, Speed, Camden, Guthrie, Carte, and Rapin; it agrees in most particulars with the following ballad, which was apparently the production of some northern minstrel, who was well affected to the two noblemen. It is here printed from two MS copies, one of them in the editor's folio collection. They contained considerable variations, out of which such readings were chosen as seemed most poetical and consonant to history. Listen, lively lordings all, Lithe and listen unto mee, And I will sing of a noble earle, The noblest earle in the north countrìe. Earle Percy is into his garden gone, And after him walkes his faire ladìe This lady was Anne, daughter of Henry Somerset, E. of Worcester.: I heare a bird sing in mine eare, That I must either fight, or flee. Now heaven forefend, my dearest lord, That ever such harm should hap to thee: But goe to London to the court, And fair fall truth and honestìe. Now nay, now nay, my lady gay, Alas! thy counsell suits not mee; Mine enemies prevail so fast, That at the court I may not bee. O goe to the court yet, good my lord, And take thy gallant men with thee: If any dare to doe you wrong, Then your warrant they may bee. Now nay, now nay, thou lady faire, The court is full of subtiltìe; And if I goe to the court, lady, Never more I may thee see. Yet goe to the court, my lord, she sayes, And I myselfe will goe wi' thee: At court then for my dearest lord, His faithfull borrowe I will bee. Now nay, now nay, my lady deare; Far lever had I lose my life, Than leave among my cruell foes My love in jeopardy and strife. But come thou hither, my little foot-pàge, Come thou hither unto mee, To maister Norton thou must goe In all the haste that ever may bee. Commend me to that gentlemàn, And beare this letter here fro mee; And say that earnestly I praye, He will ryde in my companìe. One while the little footpage went, And another while he ran; Untill he came to his journeys end, The little footpage never blan. When to that gentleman he came, Down he knelt upon his knee; Quoth he, My lord commendeth him, And sends this letter unto thee. And when the letter it was redd Affore that goodlye companye, I wis, if you the truthe wold know, There was many a weeping eye. He sayd, Come thither, Christopher Norton, A gallant youth thou seemst to bee; What doest thou counsell me, my sonne, Now that good earle's in jeopardy? Father, my counselle's fair and free; That earle he is a noble lord, And whatsoever to him you hight, I wold not have you breake your word. Gramercy, Christopher, my sonne, Thy counsell well it liketh mee, And if we speed and scape with life, Well advanced thou shalt bee. Come you hither, my nine good sonnes, Gallant men I trowe you bee: How many of you, my children deare, Will stand by that good earle and mee? Eight of them did answer make, Eight of them spake hastilie, O father, till the daye we dye We'll stand by that good earle and thee. Gramercy now, my children deare, You showe yourselves right bold and brave; And whethersoe'er I live or dye, A fathers blessing you shal have. But what sayst thou, O Francis Norton, Thou art mine eldest sonn and heire: Somewhat lyes brooding in thy breast; Whatever it bee, to mee declare. Father, you are an aged man, Your head is white, your bearde is gray; It were a shame at these your yeares For you to ryse in such a fray. Now fye upon thee, coward Francis, Thou never learnedst this of mee: When thou wert yong and tender of age, Why did I make soe much of thee? But, father, I will wend with you, Unarm'd and naked will I bee; And he that strikes against the crowne, Ever an ill death may he dee. Then rose that reverend gentleman, And with him came a goodlye band To join with the brave Earl Percy, And all the flower o' Northumberland. With them the noble Nevill came, The earle of Westmorland was hee: At Wetherbye they mustred their host, Thirteen thousand faire to see. Lord Westmorland his ancyent raisde, The Dun Bull he rays'd on hye, Three Dogs with golden collars brave Were there sett out most royallye The supporters of the Nevilles Earls of Westmoreland were Two Bulls Argent, ducally collar'd Gold, armed Or, &amp;c. But I have not discovered the Device mentioned in the Ballad, among the Badges, &amp;c. given by that House. This however is certain, that among those of the Nevilles Lords Abergavenny (who were of the same family) is a Dun Cow with a Golden Collar: and the Nevilles of Chyte in Yorkshire, (of the Westmoreland Branch) gave for their Crest in 1513, a Dog's (Grey-hound's) Head erased.—So that it is not improbable but Charles Neville, the unhappy Earl of Westmoreland here mentioned, might on this occasion give the above Device on his Banner.—After all our old Minstrel's verses here may have undergone some corruption; for in another Ballad in the same folio MS. and apparently written by the same hand, containing the Sequel of this Lord Westmoreland's History, his Banner is thus described, more conformable to his known Bearings: “Sett me up my faire Dun Bull, “Wi' th'Gilden Hornes, hee beares soe hye.”. Earl Percy there his ancyent spred, The Halfe-Moone shining all soe faire The Silver Crescent is a well-known Crest or Badge of the Northumberland family. It was probably brought home from some of the Cruzades against the Sarazens. In an ancient Pedigree in verse, finely illuminated on a Roll of Vellum, and written in the reign of Henry VII. (in possession of the family) we have this fabulous account given of its original.—The author begins with accounting for the name of Gernon or Algernon; often born by the Percies: who he says were . . . . Gernons fyrst named of Brutys bloude of Troy: Which valliantly fyghtynge in the land of Persè[Persia] At pointe terrible ayance the miscreants on nyght, An hevynly mystery was schewyd hym, old bookys reherse; In hys scheld did schyne a Mone veryfying her lyght, Which to all the ooste yave a perfytte syght, To vaynquys his enmys, and to deth them persue; And therfore the Persès [Percies] the Cressant doth renew. In the dark ages no Family was deemed considerable that did not derive its descent from the Trojan Brutus; or that was not distinguished by prodigies and miracles.: The Nortons ancyent had the crosse, And the five wounds our Lord did beare. Then Sir George Bowes he straitwaye rose, After them some spoyle to make: Those noble earles turn'd backe againe, And aye they vowed that knight to take. That baron he to his castle fled, To Barnard castle then fled hee. The uttermost walles were eathe to win, The earles have wonne them presentlìe. The uttermost walles were lime and bricke; But thoughe they won them soon anone, Long e'er they wan the innermost walles, For they were cut in rocke of stone. Then newes unto leeve London came In all the speede that ever may bee, And word is brought to our royall queene Of the rysing in the North countrie. Her grace she turned her round about, And like a royall queene she swore This is quite in character: her majesty would sometimes swear as her nobles, as well as box their ears., I will ordayne them such a breakfast, As never was in the North before. She caus'd thirty thousand men be rays'd, With horse and harneis faire to see; She caused thirty thousand men be raised, To take the earles i'th' North countrìe. Wi' them the false Earle Warwick went, Th'earle Sussex and the lord Hunsdèn; Untill they to Yorke castle came I wiss, they never stint ne blan. Now spread thy ancyent, Westmorland, Thy dun bull faine would we spye: And thou, the Earl o' Northumberland, Now rayse thy half moone up on hye. But the dun bulle is fled and gone, And the halfe moone vanished away: The Earles, though they were brave and bold, Against soe many could not stay. Thee, Norton, wi' thine eight good sonnes, They doom'd to dye, alas! for ruth! Thy reverend lockes thee could not save, Nor them their faire and blooming youthe. Wi' them full many a gallant wight They cruellye bereav'd of life: And many a childe made fatherlesse, And widowed many a tender wife. IV. NORTHUMBERLAND BETRAYED BY DOUGLAS. This ballad may be considered as the sequel of the preceding. After the unfortunate Earl of Northumberland had seen himself forsaken of his followers, he endeavoured to withdraw into Scotland, but falling into the hands of the thievish borderers, was stript and otherwise ill-treated by them. At length he reached the house of Hector of Harlaw, an Armstrong, with whom he hoped to lie concealed: for Hector had engaged his honour to be true to him, and was under great obligations to this unhappy nobleman. But this faithless wretch betrayed his guest for a sum of money to Murray the Regent of Scotland, who sent him to the castle of Lough-leven, then belonging to William Douglas.— All the writers of that time assure us that Hector, who was rich before, fell shortly after into poverty, and became so infamous, that to take Hector's cloak, grew into a proverb to express a man, who betrays his friend. See Camden, Carleton, Holingshed, &amp;c. Lord Northumberland continued in the castle of Loughleven, till the year 1572; when James Douglas Earl of Morton being elected Regent, he was given up to the Lord Hunsden at Berwick, and being carried to York, suffered death. As Morton's party depended on Elizabeth for protection, an elegant Historian thinks “it was scarce possible for them to refuse putting into her hands, a person who had taken up arms against her. But as a sum of money was paid on that account, and shared between Morton and his kinsman Douglas, the former of whom during his exile in England had been much indebted to Northumberland's friendship, the abandoning this unhappy nobleman to inevitable destruction, was deemed an ungrateful and mercenary act.” Robertson's Hist. So far history coincides with this ballad, which was apparently written by some northern bard, soon after the event. The interposal of the witch-lady (v. 53.) is probably his own invention: yet even this hath some countenance from history; for about 25 years before, the Lady Jane Douglas, Lady Glamis, sister of the earl of Angus, and nearly related to Douglas of Lough-leven, had suffered death for the pretended crime of witchcraft; who, it is presumed, is the lady alluded to in verse 133. The following is printed (like the former) from two copies: one of them in the Editor's folio MS: Which also contains another ballad on the escape of the E. of Westmoreland, who got safe into Flanders, and is feigned in the ballad to have undergone a great variety of adventures. How long shall fortune faile me nowe, And harrowe me with fear and dread? How long shall I in bale abide, In misery my life to lead? To fall from my bliss, alas the while! It was my sore and heavye lott: And I must leave my native land, And I must live a man forgot. One gentle Armstrong I doe ken, A Scot he is much bound to mee: He dwelleth on the border side, To him I'll goe right privilìe. Thus did the noble Percy 'plaine, With a heavy heart and wel-away, When he with all his gallant men On Bramham moor had lost the day. But when he to the Armstrongs came, They dealt with him all treacherouslye; For they did strip that noble earle: And ever an ill death may they dye. False Hector to Earl Murray sent, To shew him where his guest did hide: Who sent him to the Lough-levèn, With William Douglas to abide. And when he to the Douglas came, He halched him right curteouslíe: Say'd, Welcome, welcome, noble earle, Here thou shalt safelye bide with mee. When he had in Lough-leven been Many a month and many a day; To the regent James Douglas Earl of Morton, elected regent of Scotland, Nov. 24. 1572. the lord warden Of one of the English marches. Lord Hunsden. sent, That bannisht earle for to betray. He offered him great store of gold, And wrote a letter fair to see: Saying, Good my lord, grant me my boon, And yield that banisht man to mee. Earle Percy at the supper sate With many a goodly gentleman: The wylie Douglas then bespake, And thus to flyte with him began: What makes you be so sad, my lord, And in your mind so sorrowfullyè? To-morrow a shootinge will bee held Among the lords of the North countryè. The butts are sett, the shooting's made, And there will be great royaltìe: And I am sworne into my bille, Thither to bring my lord Percìe. I'll give thee my hand, thou gentle Douglas, And here by my true faith, quoth hee, If thou wilt ride to the worldes end, I will ride in thy companìe. And then bespake a lady faire, Mary à Douglas was her name: You shall bide here, good English lord, My brother is a traiterous man. He is a traitor stout and strong, As I tell you in privitìe: For he has tane liverance of the earle Of the earl of Morton, the Regent., Into England nowe to 'liver thee. Now nay, now nay, thou goodly lady, The regent is a noble lord: Ne for the gold in all Englànd, The Douglas wold not break his word. When the regent was a banisht man, With me he did faire welcome find; And whether weal or woe betide, I still shall find him true and kind. Tween England and Scotland 'twold break truce, And friends again they wold never bee, If they shold 'liver a banisht earle Was driven out of his own countrie. Alas! alas! my lord, she sayes, Nowe mickle is their traitorìe; Then let my brother ride his ways, And tell those English lords from thee, How that you cannot with him ride, Because you are in an isle of the sea i. e. Lake of Leven, which hath communication with the sea., Then ere my brother come againe To Edinbrow castle At that time in the hands of the opposite faction. Ile carry thee. To the Lord Hume I will thee bring, He is well knowne a true Scots lord, And he will lose both land and life, Ere he with thee will break his word. Much is my woe, Lord Percy sayd, When I thinkíe on my own countrie, When I thinke on the heavye happe My friends have suffered there for mee. Much is my woe, Lord Percy sayd, And sore those wars my minde distresse; Where many a widow lost her mate, And many a child was fatherlesse. And now that I a banisht man, Shold bring such evil happe with mee, To cause my faire and noble friends To be suspect of treacherie: This rives my heart with double woe; And lever had I dye this day, Than thinke a Douglas can be false, Or ever he will his guest betray. If you'll give me no trust, my lord, Nor unto mee no credence yield; Yet step one moment here aside, Ile showe you all your foes in field. Lady, I never loved witchcraft, Never dealt in privy wyle; But evermore held the high-waye Of truth and honours, free from guile. If you'll not come yourselfe my lorde, Yet send your chamberlaine with mee; Let me but speak three words with him, And he shall come again to thee. James Swynard with that lady went, She showed him through the weme of her ring How many English lords there were Waiting for his master and him. And who walkes yonder, my good lady, So royallyè on yonder greene? O yonder is the lord Hunsdèn The Lord Warden of the East marches.: Alas! he'll doe you drie and teene. And who beth yonder, thou gay ladye, That walkes so proudly him beside? That is Sir William Drury Governor of Berwick., she sayd, A keen captàine he is and tryed. How many miles is it, madàme, Betwixt yond English lords and mee? Marry it is thrice fifty miles, To sayl to them upon the sea. I never was on English ground, Ne never sawe it with mine eye, But as my book it sheweth mee, And through my ring I may descrye. My mother she was a witch ladye, And of her skille she learned mee; She wold let me see out of Lough-leven What they did in London citìe. But who is yond, thou lady faire, That looketh with sic an austerne face? Yonder is Sir John Foster Warden of the Middle march., quoth shee, Alas! he'll do ye sore disgrace. He pulled his hatt down over his browe, And in his heart he was full of woe; And he is gone to his noble lord, Those sorrowful tidings him to show. Now nay, now nay, good James Swynàrd, I may not believe that witch ladìe: The Douglasses were ever true, And they can ne'er prove false to mee. I have now in Lough-leven been The most part of these years three, And I have never had noe outrake, Ne no good games that I cold see. Therefore I'll to yond shooting wend, As to the Douglas I have hight: Betide me weale, betide me woe, He ne'er shall find my promise light. He writhe a gold ring from his finger, And gave it to that faire ladìe: Sayes, It was all that I cold save, In Harley woods where I could be i. e. Where I was. An ancient Idiom.. And wilt thou goe, thou noble lord, Then farewell truth and honestìe; And farewell heart and farewell hand; For never more I shall thee see. The wind was faire, the boatmen call'd, And all the saylors were on borde; Then William Douglas took to his boat, And with him went that noble lord. Then he cast up a silver wand, Says, Gentle lady, fare thee well! The lady fett a sigh soe deep, And in a dead swoone down shee fell. Now let us goe back, Douglas, he sayd, A sickness hath taken yond faire ladìe; If ought befall yond lady but good, Then blamed for ever I shall bee. Come on, come on, my lord, he sayes; Come on, come on, and let her bee: There's ladyes enow in Lough-leven For to chear that gay ladìe. If you'll not turne yourself, my lord, Let me goe with my chamberlaine; We will but comfort that faire lady, And wee will return to you againe. Come on, come on, my lord, he sayes, Come on, come on, and let her bee: My sister is crafty, and wold beguile A thousand such as you and mee. When they had sayled There is no navigable stream between Lough-leven and the sea: but a ballad-maker is not obliged to understand Geography. fifty mile, Fifty mile upon the sea; He sent his man to ask the Douglas, When they shold that shooting see. Faire words, quoth he, they make fools faine, And that by thee and thy lord is seen: You may hap to think it soon enough, Ere you that shooting reach, I ween. Jamey his hatt pulled over his browe, He thought his lord then was betray'd; And he is to Earle Percy againe, To tell him what the Douglas sayd. Hold up thy head, man, quoth his lord; Nor therefore let thy courage fail: He did it but to prove thy heart, To see if he cold make it quail. When they had other fifty sayld, Other fifty mile upon the sea, Lord Percy call'd to the Douglas himselfe, Sayd, What wilt thou nowe doe with mee? Looke that your bridle be wight, my lord, And your horse goe swift as ship at sea: Looke that your spurres be bright and sharp, That you may prick her while she'll away. What needeth this, Douglas, he sayd; What needest thou to flyte with mee? For I was counted a horseman good Before that ever I met with thee. A false Hector he hath my horse, Who dealt with mee so treacherouslìe: A false Armstrong he hath my spurres, And all the geere that belongs to mee. When they had sayled other fifty mile, Other fifty mile upon the sea: They landed him at Berwick towne, The Douglas landed Lord Percìe. Then he at Yorke was doomde to dye, It was, alas! a sorrowful sight: Thus they betrayed that noble earle, Who ever was a gallant wight. V. MY MIND TO ME A KINGDOM IS. This excellent philosophical song appears to have been famous in the sixteenth century. It is quoted by Ben Jonson in his play of “Every man out of his humour,” first acted in 1599. A. 1. sc. 1. where an impatient person says, “I am no such pil'd cynique to beleeve “That beggery is the onely happinesse, “Or, with a number of these patient fooles, “To sing, “My minde to me a kingdome is,” “When the lanke hungrie belly barkes for foode.” It is here chiefly printed from a thin quarto Musick-book, intitled, “Bassus. Psalmes, Sonets and Songs of sadnes and pietie, made into Musicke of five parts: &amp;c. By William Byrd, one of the Gent. of the Queenes Maiesties honorable Chappell.—Printed by Thomas East, &amp;c.” 4to. no date: but Ames in his Typog. has mentioned another edit. of the same book, dated 1588, which I take to have been later than this of ours. Some improvements and an additional stanza (sc. the 5th.) were had from two other ancient copies; one of them in black letter in the Pepys Collection, thus inscribed, “A sweet and pleasant sonet, entituled, “My Minde to me a Kingdom is. To the tune of, In Crete, &amp;c.” To these last were subjoined four other stanzas, as part of the same poem, and were accordingly so printed in our first edit. but as they are given separate by Byrd, as an independent piece, they are accordingly so printed here: See below, Song VII. My minde to me a kingdome is; Such perfect joy therein I finde As farre exceeds all earthly blisse, That God or Nature hath assignde: Though much I want, that most would have, Yet still my mind forbids to crave. Content I live, this is my stay; I seek no more than may suffice: I presse to beare no haughtie sway; Look what I lack my mind supplies. Loe! thus I triumph like a king, Content with that my mind doth bring. I see how plentie surfets oft, And hastie clymbers soonest fall: I see that such as sit aloft Mishap doth threaten most of all: These get with toile, and keep with feare: Such cares my mind could never beare. No princely pompe, nor welthie store, No force to winne a victorie, No wylie wit to salve a sore, No shape to winne a lovers eye; To none of these I yeeld as thrall, For why my mind dispiseth all. Some have too much, yet still they crave, I little have, yet seek no more: They are but poore, tho' much they have; And I am rich with little store: They poor, I rich; they beg, I give; They lacke, I lend; they pine, I give. I laugh not at anothers losse, I grudge not at anothers gaine; No worldly wave my mind can tosse, I brooke that is anothers bane: I feare no foe, nor fawne on friend; I loth not life, nor dread mine end. My welth is health, and perfect ease; My conscience clere my chiefe defence: I never seeke by brybes to please, Nor by desert to give offence: Thus do I live, thus will I die; Would all did so as well as I! VI. THE PATIENT COUNTESS. The following tale is found in an ancient poem intitled Albion's England, written by W. Warner, a celebrated Poet in the reign of Q. Elizabeth, tho' his name and works are now equally forgotten. The reader will find some account of him in Vol. 2. p. 231. 232. The following stanzas are printed from the author's improved edition of his work, printed in 1602. 4to. This seems to have been the third impression, for “The first and second Parts of Albion's England, &amp;c.” made their first appearance in 1583, 4to; and were reprinted in 1597, under the title of “Albion's England; a continued historie of the same kingdom,” &amp;c. 4to. See Ames's Typography, where is preserved the memory of another publication of this writer's, intitled, “Warner's Poetry,” printed in 1586, 12mo. and reprinted in 1602. It is proper to premise, that the following lines were not written by the Author in stanzas, but in long Alexandrines of 14 syllables; which the narrowness of our page made it here necessary to subdivide. Impatience chaungeth smoke to flame, But jelousie is hell; Some wives by patience have reduc'd Ill husbands to live well: As did the ladie of an earle, Of whom I now shall tell. An earle ‘there was’ had wedded, lov'd; Was lov'd, and lived long Full true to his fayre countesse; yet At last he did her wrong. Once hunted he untill the chace, Long fasting, and the heat Did house him in a peakish graunge Within a forest great. Where knowne and welcom'd (as the place And persons might afforde) Browne bread, whig, bacon, curds and milke Were set him on the borde. A cushion made of lists, a stoole Halfe backed with a hoope Were brought him, and he sitteth down Besides a sorry coupe. The poore old couple wisht their bread Were wheat, their whig were perry, Their bacon beefe, their milke and curds Were creame, to make him merry. Meane while (in russet neatly clad, With linen white as swanne, Herselfe more white, save rosie where The ruddy colour ranne: Whome naked nature, not the aydes Of arte made to excell) The good man's daughter sturres to see That all were feat and well; The earle did marke her, and admire Such beautie there to dwell. Yet fals he to their homely fare, And held him at a feast: But as his hunger slaked, so An amorous heat increast. When this repast was past, and thanks, And welcome too; he sayd Unto his host and hostesse, in The hearing of the mayd: Yee know, quoth he, that I am lord Of this, and many townes; I also know that you be poore, And I can spare you pownes. Soe will I, so yee will consent, That yonder lasse and I May bargaine for her love; at least, Doe give me leave to trye. Who needs to know it? nay who dares Into my doings pry? First they mislike, yet at the length For lucre were misled; And then the gamesome earle did wowe The damsell for his bed. He took her in his armes, as yet So coyish to be kist, As mayds that know themselves belov'd, And yieldingly resist. In few, his offers were so large She lastly did consent; With whom he lodged all that night, And early home he went. He tooke occasion oftentimes In such a sort to hunt. Whom when his lady often mist, Contràry to his wont, And lastly was informed of His amorous haunt elsewhere; It greev'd her not a little, though She seem'd it well to beare. And thus she reasons with herselfe, Some fault perhaps in me; Somewhat is done, that so he doth: Alas! what may it be? How may I winne him to myself? He is a man, and men Have imperfections; it behooves Me pardon nature then. To checke him were to make him checke To check is a term in falconry, applied when a hawk stops and turns away from his proper pursuit: To check also signifies to reprove or abide. It is in this verse used in both senses, Although hee now were chaste: A man controuled of his wife, To her makes lesser haste. If duty then, or daliance may Prevayle to alter him; I will be dutifull, and make My selfe for daliance trim. So was she, and so lovingly Did entertaine her lord, As fairer, or more faultles none Could be for bed or bord. Yet still he loves his leiman, and Did still pursue that game, Suspecting nothing less, than that His lady knew the same: Wherefore to make him know she knew, She this devise did frame: When long she had been wrong'd, and sought The foresayd meanes in vaine, She rideth to the simple graunge But with a slender traine. She lighteth, entreth, greets them well, And then did looke about her: The guiltie houshold knowing her, Did wish themselves without her; Yet, for she looked merily, The lesse they did misdoubt her. When she had seen the beauteous wench (Than blushing fairnes fairer) Such beauty made the countesse hold Them both excus'd the rather. Who would not bite at such a bait? Thought she: and who (though loth) So poore a wench, but gold might tempt? Sweet errors lead them both. Scarse one in twenty that had bragg'd Of proffer'd gold denied, Or of such yeelding beautie baulkt, But, tenne to one, had lied. Thus thought she: and she thus declares Her cause of coming thether; My lord, oft hunting in these partes, Through travel, night or wether, Hath often lodged in your house; I thanke you for the same; For why? it doth him jolly ease To lie so neare his game. But, for you have not furniture Beseeming such a guest, I bring his owne, and come myselfe To see his lodging drest. With that two sumpters were discharg'd, In which were hangings brave, Silke coverings, curtens, carpets, plate, And al such turn should have. When all was handsomly dispos'd, She prayes them to have care That nothing hap in their default, That might his health impair: And, Damsell, quoth shee, for it seemes This houshold is but three, And for thy parents age, that this Shall chiefely rest on thee; Do me that good, else would to God He hither come no more. So tooke she horse, and ere she went Bestowed gould good store. Full little thought the countie that His countesse had done so; Who now return'd from far affaires Did to his sweet-heart go. No sooner sat he foote within The late deformed cote, But that the formall change of things His wondring eies did note. But when he knew those goods to be His proper goods; though late, Scarce taking leave, he home returnes The matter to debate. The countesse was a-bed, and he With her his lodging tooke; Sir, welcome home (quoth shee); this night For you I did not looke. Then did he question her of such His stuffe bestowed soe. Forsooth, quoth she, because I did Your love and lodging knowe: Your love to be a proper wench, Your lodging nothing lesse; I held it for your health, the house More decently to dresse. Well wot I, notwithstanding her, Your lordship loveth me; And greater hope to hold you such By quiet, then brawles, ‘you’ see. Then for my duty, your delight, And to retaine your favour, All done I did, and patiently Expect your wonted 'haviour. Her patience, witte and answer wrought His gentle teares to fall: When (kissing her a score of times) Amend, sweet wife, I shall: He said, and did it; ‘so each wife ‘Her husband may’ recall. VII. THE GOLDEN MEAN. The four stanzas following are commonly printed as part of the foregoing song, Num. V. My mind to me a kingdom is; and accordingly so stand in our first edition. But as they are found distinct and separate, after the manner of an independent poem, with different notes of music, in Birde's bassus, it was thought proper so to give them here. I joy not in no earthly blisse; I weigh not Cresus' welth a straw; For care, I care not what it is; I feare not fortunes fatall law: My mind is such as may not move For beautie bright or force of love. I wish but what I have at will; I wander not to seeke for more; I like the plaine, I clime no hill; In greatest stormes I sitte on shore, And laugh at them that toile in vaine To get what must be lost againe. I kisse not where I wish to kill; I faine not love where most I hate; I breake no sleep to winne my will; I wayte not at the mighties gate; I scorne no poore, I feare no rich; I feele no want, nor have too much. The court, ne cart, I like, ne loath; Extreames are counted worst of all; The golden meane betwixt them both, Doth surest sit, and fears no fall: This is my choyce, for why I finde, No wealth is like a quiet minde. VIII. DOWSABELL. The following stanzas were written by Michael Drayton, a poet of some eminence in the reigns of Q. Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. He was born in 1563, and died in 1631. Biog. Brit. They are inserted in one of his Pastorals, the first edition of which bears this whimsical Title. “Idea. The Shepheards Garland fashioned in nine Eglogs. Rowlands sacrifice to the nine muses. Lond. 1593.” 4to. They are inscribed with the Author's name at length “To the noble and valerous gentleman master Robert Dudley, &amp;c.” It is very remarkable that when Drayton reprinted them in the first folio Edit. of his works, 1619, he had given those Eclogues so thorough a revisal that there is hardly a line to be found the same as in the old Edition. This poem had received the fewest corrections, and therefore is chiefly given from the ancient copy, where it is thus introduced by one of his Shepherds: Listen to mee, my lovely shepheards joye, And thou shalt heare, with mirth and mickle glee, A pretie tale, which when I was a boy, My toothles grandame oft hath tolde to me. The Author has professedly imitated the style and metre of some of the old metrical Romances; particularly that of Sir Isenbras As also Chaucer's Rhyme of Sir Topas. v. 6., (alluded to in v. 3.) as the reader may judge from the following specimen: Lordynges, lysten, and you shal here, &amp;c. Ye shall well heare of a knight, That was in warre full wyght, And doughtye of his dede: His name was Syr Isenbras, Man nobler then he was Lyved none with breade. He was lyvely, large, and longe, With shoulders broade, and armes stronge, That myghtie was to se: He was a hardye man, and hye, All men hym loved that hym se, For a gentyll knight was he: Harpers loved him in hall, With other minstrells all, For he gave them golde and fee, &amp;c. This ancient Legend was printed in black letter, 4to, by Wyllyam Copland; no date.—In the Cotton Library (Calig. A. 2.) is a MS copy of the same Romance containing the greatest variations. They are probably two different translations of some French Original. Farre in the countrey of Arden, There won'd a knight, hight Cassemen, As bolde as Isenbras: Fell was he, and eger bent, In battell and in tournament, As was the good Sir Topas. He had, as antique stories tell, A daughter cleaped Dowsabel, A mayden fayre and free: And for she was her fathers heire, Full well she was y-cond the leyre Of mickle curtesie. The silke well couth she twist and twine, And make the fine march-pine, And with the needle werke: And she couth helpe the priest to say His mattins on a holy-day, And sing a psalme in kirke. She ware a frock of frolicke greene, Might well beseeme a mayden queene, Which seemly was to see; A hood to that so neat and fine, In colour like the colombine, Y-wrought full featously. Her features all as fresh above, As is the grasse that growes by Dove; And lyth as lasse of Kent. Her skin as soft as Lemster wooll, As white as snow on Peakish Hull, Or swanne that swims in Trent. This mayden in a morne betime Went forth, when May was in her prime, To get sweete cetywall, The honey-suckle, the harlocke, The lilly and the lady-smocke, To deck her summer hall. Thus, as she wandred here and there, Y-picking of the bloomed breere, She chanced to espie A shepheard sitting on a bancke, Like chanteclere he crowed crancke, And pip'd full merrilie. He lear'd his sheepe as he him list, When he would whistle in his fist, To feede about him round; Whilst he full many a carroll sung, Untill the fields and medowes rung, And all the woods did sound. In favour this same shepheards swayne Was like the bedlam Tamburlayne Alluding to “Tamburlaine the great, or the Scythian Shepheard.” 1590. 8vo. an old ranting play ascribed to Marlowe., Which helde prowd kings in awe: But meeke he was as lamb mought be; And innocent of ill as he Whom his lewd brother slaw. The shepheard ware a sheepe-gray cloke, Which was of the finest loke, That could be cut with sheere: His mittens were of bauzens skinne, His cockers were of cordiwin, His hood of meniveere. His aule and lingell in a thong, His tar-boxe on his broad belt hong, His breech of coyntrie blewe: Full crispe and curled were his lockes, His browes as white as Albion rocks: So like a lover true, And pyping still he spent the day, So merry as the popingay; Which liked Dowsabel: That would she ought, or would she nought, This lad would never from her thought; She in love-longing fell. At length she tucked up her frocke, White as a lilly was her smocke, She drew the shepheard nye: But then the shepheard pyp'd a good, That all his sheepe forsooke their foode, To heare his melodye. Thy sheepe, quoth she, cannot be leane, That have a jolly shepheards swayne, The which can pipe so well: Yea but, sayth he, their shepheard may, If pyping thus he pine away, In love of Dowsabel. Of love, fond boy, take thou no keepe, Quoth she; looke thou unto thy sheepe, Lest they should hap to stray. Quoth she, so had I done full well, Had I not seen fayre Dowsabell Come forth to gather maye. With that she gan to vaile her head, Her cheeks were like the roses red, But not a word she sayd: With that the shepheard gan to frowne, He threw his pretie pypes adowne, And on the ground him layd. Sayth she, I may not stay till night, And leave my summer-hall undight, And all for long of thee. My coate, sayth he, nor yet my foulde Shall neither sheepe, nor shepheard hould, Except thou favour mee. Sayth she, Yet lever were I dead, Then I should lose my mayden-head, And all for love of men. Sayth he, Yet are you too unkind, If in your heart you cannot finde To love us now and then. And I to thee will be as kinde As Colin was to Rosalinde, Of curtesie the flower. Then will I be as true, quoth she, As ever mayden yet might be Unto her paramour. With that she bent her snow-white knee, Downe by the shepheard kneeled shee, And him she sweetely kist: With that the shepheard whoop'd for joy, Quoth he, ther's never shepheards boy That ever was so blist. IX. THE FAREWELL TO LOVE From Beaumont and Fletcher's play, intitled The Lover's Progress. A. 3. sc. 1. Adieu, fond love, farewell you wanton powers; I am free again. Thou dull disease of bloud and idle hours, Bewitching pain, Fly to fools, that sigh away their time: My nobler love to heaven doth climb, And there behold beauty still young, That time can ne'er corrupt nor death destroy, Immortal sweetness by fair angels sung, And honoured by eternity and joy: There lies my love, thither my hopes aspire, Fond love declines, this heavenly love grows higher. X. ULYSSES AND THE SYREN —affords a pretty poetical contest between Pleasure and Honour. It is found at the end of “Hymen's triumph: a “pastoral tragicomedie” written by Daniel, and printed among his works, 4to. 1623.—Daniel, who was a contemporary of Drayton's, and is said to have been poet laureat to Queen Elizabeth, was born in 1562, and died in 1619. Anne Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery (to whom Daniel had been Tutor) has inserted a small Portrait of him in a full-length Picture of herself, preserved at Appleby Castle in Cumberland. This little poem is the rather selected for a specimen of Daniel's poetic powers, as it is omitted in the later edition of his works, 2 vol. 12mo. 1718. Syren. Come, worthy Greeke, Ulysses come, Possesse these shores with me, The windes and seas are troublesome, And here we may be free. Here may we sit and view their toyle, That travaile in the deepe, Enjoy the day in mirth the while, And spend the night in sleepe. Ulysses. Faire nymph, if fame or honour were To be attain'd with ease, Then would I come and rest with thee, And leave such toiles as these: But here it dwels, and here must I With danger seek it forth; To spend the time luxuriously Becomes not men of worth. Syren. Ulysses, O be not deceiv'd With that unreall name: This honour is a thing conceiv'd, And rests on others' fame. Begotten only to molest Our peace, and to beguile (The best thing of our life) our rest, And give us up to toyle! Ulysses. Delicious nymph, suppose there were No honour, or report, Yet manlinesse would scorne to weare The time in idle sport: For toyle doth give a better touch To make us feele our joy; And ease findes tediousnes, as much As labour yeelds annoy. Syren. Then pleasure likewise seemes the shore, Whereto tendes all your toyle; Which you forego to make it more, And perish oft the while. Who may disport them diversly, Find never tedious day; And ease may have variety, As well as action may. Ulysses. But natures of the noblest frame These toyles and dangers please; And they take comfort in the same, As much as you in ease: And with the thought of actions past Are recreated still: When pleasure leaves a touch at last To shew that it was ill. Syren. That doth opinion only cause, That's out of custom bred; Which makes us many other laws, Than ever nature did. No widdowes waile for our delights, Our sports are without blood; The world we see by warlike wights Receives more hurt than good. Ulysses. But yet the state of things require These motions of unrest, And these great spirits of high desire Seem borne to turne them best: To purge the mischiefes, that increase And all good order mar: For oft we see a wicked peace, To be well chang'd for war. Syren. Well, well, Ulysses, then I see I shall not have thee here; And therefore I will come to thee, And take my fortune there. I must be wonne that cannot win, Yet lost were I not wonne: For beauty hath created bin T'undoo or be undone, XI. CUPID'S PASTIME. The attribution of this poem is questionable. This beautiful poem, which possesses a classical elegance hardly to be expected in the age of James I. is printed from the 4th edition of Davison's poems See the full title in vol. 2. p. 299., &amp;c. 1621. It is also found in a later miscellany, intitled, “Le Prince d'amour.” 1660. 8vo.—Francis Davison, editor of the poems above reserred to, was son of that unfortunate secretary of state, who suffered so much from the affair of Mary Q. of Scots. These poems, he tells us in his preface, were written by himself, by his brother [Walter], who was a soldier in the wars of the Low Countries, and by some dear friends “anonymoi.” Among them are found pieces by Sir J. Davis, the Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney, Spenser, and other wits of those times. In the fourth vol. of Dryden's Miscellanies, this poem is attributed to Sydney Godolphin, Esq; but erroneously, being probably written before he was born. One edit. of Davison's book was published in 1608. Godolphin was born in 1610, and died in 1642–3. Ath. Ox. II. 23. It chanc'd of late a shepherd swain, That went to seek his straying sheep, Within a thicket on a plaín Espied a dainty nymph asleep. Her golden hair o'erspred her face; Her careless arms abroad were cast; Her quiver had her pillows place; Her breast lay bare to every blast. The shepherd stood and gaz'd his fill; Nought durst he do; nought durst he say; Whilst chance, or else perhaps his will, Did guide the god of love that way. The crafty boy thus sees her sleep, Whom if she wak'd he durst not see; Behind her closely seeks to creep, Before her nap should ended bee. There come, he steals her shafts away, And puts his own into their place; Nor dares he any longer stay, But, ere she wakes, hies thence apace. Scarce was he gone, but she awakes, And spies the shepherd standing by: Her bended bow in haste she takes, And at the simple swain lets flye. Forth flew the shaft, and pierc'd his heart, That to the ground he fell with pain: Yet up again forthwith he start, And to the nymph he ran amain. Amazed to see so strange a sight, She shot, and shot, but all in vain; The more his wounds, the more his might, Love yielded strength amidst his pain. Her angry eyes were great with tears, She blames her hand, she blames her skill; The bluntness of her shafts she fears, And try them on herself she will. Take heed, sweet nymph, trye not thy shaft, Each little touch will pierce thy heart: Alas! thou know'st not Cupids craft; Revenge is joy; the end is smart. Yet try she will, and pierce some bare; Her hands were glov'd, but next to hand Was that fair breast, that breast so rare, That made the shepherd senseless stand. That breast she pierc'd; and through that breast Love found an entry to her heart; At feeling of this new-come guest, Lord! how this gentle nymph did start? She runs not now; she shoots no more; Away she throws both shaft and bow: She seeks for what she shunn'd before, She thinks the shepherds haste too slow. Though mountains meet not, lovers may: What other lovers do, did they: The god of love sate on a tree, And laught that pleasant sight to see. XII. THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE. This little moral poem was writ by Sir Henry Wotton, who died Provost of Eaton, in 1639. Æt. 72. It is printed from a little collection of his pieces, intitled Reliquiæ Wottonianæ, 1651. 12mo; compared with one or two other copies. How happy is he born or taught, That serveth not anothers will; Whose armour is his honest thought, And simple truth his highest skill: Whose passions not his masters are; Whose soul is still prepar'd for death; Not ty'd unto the world with care Of princes ear, or vulgar breath: Who hath his life from rumours freed; Whose conscience is his strong retreat; Whose state can neither flatterers feed, Nor ruine make oppressors great: Who envies none, whom chance doth raise, Or vice: Who never understood How deepest wounds are given with praise; Nor rules of state, but rules of good: Who God doth late and early pray More of his grace than gifts to lend; And entertaines the harmless day With a well-chosen book or friend. This man is freed from servile bands Of hope to rise, or feare to fall; Lord of himselfe, though not of lands; And having nothing, yet hath all. XIII. GILDEROY —was a famous robber, who lived about the middle of the last century, if we may credit the histories and storybooks of highwaymen, which relate many improbable feats of him, as his robbing Cardinal Richlieu, Oliver Cromwell, &amp;c. But these stories have probably no other authority, than the records of Grub-street: At least the Gilderoy, who is the hero of Scottish Songsters, seems to have lived in an earlier age; for in Thompson's Orpheus Caledonius, vol. 2. 1733. 8vo. is a copy of this ballad, which, tho' corrupt and interpolated, contains some lines that appear to be of genuine antiquity: in these he is represented as contemporary with Mary Q. of Scots: ex. gr. “The Queen of Scots possessed nought, “That my love let me want: “For cow and ew he brought to me, “And ein whan they were scant.” Those lines perhaps might safely have been inserted among the following stanzas, which are given from a written copy, that seems to have received some modern corrections. Indeed the common popular ballad contained some indecent luxuriances that required the pruning-book. Gilderoy was a bonnie boy, Had roses tull his shoone, His stockings were of silken soy, Wi' garters hanging doune: It was, I weene, a comelie sight, To see sae trim a boy; He was my jo and hearts delight, My handsome Gilderoy. Oh! sike twa charming een he had, A breath as sweet as rose, He never ware a Highland plaid, But costly silken clothes; He gain'd the luve of ladies gay, Nane eir tull him was coy, Ah! wae is mee! I mourn the day, For my dear Gilderoy. My Gilderoy and I were born, Baith in one toun together, We scant were seven years beforn, We gan to luve each other; Our dadies and our mammies thay, Were fill'd wi' mickle joy, To think upon the bridal day, Twixt me and Gilderoy. For Gilderoy that luve of mine, Gude faith, I freely bought A wedding sark of holland fine, Wi' silken flowers wrought: And he gied me a wedding ring, Which I receiv'd wi' joy, Nae lad nor lassie eir could sing, Like me and Gilderoy. Wi' mickle joy we spent our prime, Till we were baith sixteen, And aft we past the langsome time, Among the leaves sae green; Aft on the banks we'd sit us thair, And sweetly kiss and toy, Wi' garlands gay wad deck my hair My handsome Gilderoy. Oh! that he still had been content, Wi' me to lead his life, But, ah! his manfu' heart was bent, To stir in feates of strife: And he in many a venturous deed, His courage bauld wad try, And now this gars mine heart to bleed, For my dear Gilderoy. And when of me his leave he tuik, The tears they wat mine ee, I gave tull him a parting luik, “My benison gang wi' thee! God speed the weil, mine ain dear heart, For gane is all my joy; My heart is rent sith we maun part, My handsome Gilderoy.” My Gilderoy baith far and near, Was fear'd in every toun, And bauldly bare away the gear, Of many a lawland loun; Nane eir durst meet him man to man, He was sae brave a boy, At length wi' numbers he was tane, My winsome Gilderoy. Wae worth the loun that made the laws, To hang a man for gear, To 'reave of life for ox or ass, For sheep, or horse, or mare: Had not their laws been made sae strick, I neir had lost my joy, Wi' sorrow neir had wat my cheek, For my dear Gilderoy. Giff Gilderoy had done amisse, He mought hae banisht been, Ah! what fair cruelty is this, To hang sike handsome men: To hang the flower o' Scottish land, Sae sweet and fair a boy; Nae lady had sae white a hand, As thee, my Gilderoy. Of Gilderoy sae fraid they were, They bound him mickle strong, Tull Edenburrow they led him thair, And on a gallows hung: They hung him high aboon the rest, He was sae trim a boy; Thair dyed the youth whom I lued best, My handsome Gilderoy. Thus having yielded up his breath, I bare his corpse away, Wi' tears, that trickled for his death, I washt his comelye clay; And siker in a grave sae deep, I laid the dear-lued boy, And now for evir maun I weep, My winsome Gilderoy. XIV. WINIFREDA. This beautiful address to conjugal love, a subject too much neglected by the libertine muses, is printed in some modern collections as a translation “from the ancient British language;” how truly I know not. See the Musical Miscellany, vol. 6. 1731. 8vo. Errata Away; let nought to love displeasing, My Winifreda, move your care; Let nought delay the heavenly blessing, Nor squeamish pride, nor gloomy fear. What tho' no grants of royal donors With pompous titles grace our blood? We'll shine in more substantial honors, And to be noble we'll be good. Our name, while virtue thus we tender, Will sweetly sound where-e'er 'tis spoke: And all the great ones, they shall wonder How they respect such little folk. What though from fortunes's lavish bounty No mighty treasures we possess, We'll find within our pittance plenty, And be content without excess. Still shall each returning season Sufficient for our wishes give; For we will live a life of reason, And that's the only life to live. Through youth and age in love excelling, We'll hand in hand together tread; Sweet-smiling peace shall crown our dwelling, And babes, sweet-smiling babes, our bed. How should I love the pretty creatures, While round my knees they fondly clung; To see them look their mothers features, To hear them lisp their mothers tongue. And when with envy time transported, Shall think to rob us of our joys, You'll in your girls again be courted, And I'll go a wooing in my boys. XV. THE WITCH OF WOKEY —was published in a small collection of poems intitled, Euthemia, or the Power of Harmony, &amp;c. 1756. written by an ingenious Physician near Bath, who chose to conceal his name. The following contains some variations from the original copy, which it is hoped the author will pardon, when he is informed they came from the elegant pen of the late Mr. Shenstone. Wokey-hole is a noted cavern in Somersetshire, which has given birth to as many wild fanciful stories as the Sybil's Cave in Italy. Thro' a very narrow entrance, it opens into a large vault, the roof whereof, either on account of its height, or the thickness of the gloom, cannot be discovered by the light of torches. It goes winding a great way under ground, is crost by a stream of very cold water, and is all horrid with broken pieces of rock: many of these are evident petrifactions; which, on account of their singular forms, have given rise to the fables alluded to in this poem. In aunciente days, tradition showes, A base and wicked else arose, The Witch of Wokey hight: Oft have I heard the fearfull tale From Sue, and Roger of the vale, On some long winter's night. Deep in the dreary dismall cell, Which seem'd and was ycleped hell, This blear-eyed hag did hide: Nine wicked elves, as legends faigne, She chose to form her guardian trayne, And kennel near her side. Here screeching owls oft made their nest, While wolves its craggy sides possest, Night-howling thro' the rock: No wholesome herb could here be found; She blasted every plant around, And blister'd every flock. Her haggard face was foull to see; Her mouth unmeet a mouth to bee; Her eyne of deadly leer. She nought devis'd, but neighbour's ill; She wreak'd on all her wayward will, And marr'd all goodly chear. All in her prime, have poets sung, No gaudy youth, gallant and young, E'er blest her longing armes: And hence arose her spight to vex, And blast the youth of either sex, By dint of hellish charmes. From Glaston came a lerned wight, Full bent to marr her fell despight, And well he did, I ween: Sich mischief never had been known, And, since his mickle lerninge shown, Sich mischief ne'er has been. He chauntede out his godlie booke, He crost the water, blest the brooke, Then—pater noster done, The ghastly hag he sprinkled o'er; When lo! where stood a hag before, Now stood a ghastly stone. Full well 'tis known adown the dale: Tho' passing strange indeed the tale, And doubtfull may appear, I'm bold to say, there's never a one, That has not seen the witch in stone, With all her household gear. But tho' this lernede clerke did well; With grieved heart, alas! I tell, She left this curse behind: That Wokey-nymphs forsaken quite, Tho' sense and beauty both unite, Should find no leman kind. For lo! even, as the fiend did say, The sex have found it to this day, That men are wondrous scant: Here's beauty, wit, and sense combin'd, With all that's good and virtuous join'd, Yet hardly one gallant. Shall then sich maids unpitied moane? They might as well, like her, be stone, As thus forsaken dwell. Since Glaston now can boast no clerks; Come down from Oxenford, ye sparks, And, oh! revoke the spell. Yet stay—nor thus despond, ye fair; Virtue's the gods' peculiar care; I hear the gracious voice: Your sex shall soon be blest agen, We only wait to find sich men, As best deserve your choice. XVI. BRYAN AND PEREENE, A West-Indian Ballad, —is founded on a real fact, that happened in the island of St. Christophers about two years ago. The editor owes the following stanzas to the friendship of Dr. James Grainger Author of a poem on the Culture of the Sugar-Cane lately published., who was in the island when this tragical incident happened, and is now (in 1765) an eminent physician there. To this ingenious gentleman the public is indebted for the fine Ode on Solitude printed in the IVth Vol. of Dodsley's Miscel. p. 229. in which are assembled some of the sublimest imagesin nature. The reader will pardon the insertion of the first stanza here, for the sake of rectifying the two last lines, which were thus given by the Author. O Solitude, romantic maid, Whether by nodding towers you tread, Or haunt the desert's trackless gloom, Or hover o'er the yawning tomb, Or climb the Andes' clifted side, Or by the Nile's coy source abide, Or starting from your half-year's sleep, From Hecla view the thawing deep, Or at the purple dawn of day Tadmor's marble wastes survey, &amp;c. alluding to the account of Palmyra published by some late ingenious travellers, and the manner in which they were struck at the first sight of those magnificent ruins by break of day So in pag. 335. read, Turn'd her magic ray.. The north-east wind did briskly blow, The ship was safely moor'd, Young Bryan thought the boat's-crew slow, And so leapt over-board. Pereene, the pride of Indian dames, His heart long held in thrall, And whoso his impatience blames, I wot, ne'er lov'd at all. A long long year, one month and day, He dwelt on English land, Nor once in thought or deed would stray, Tho' ladies sought his hand. For Bryan he was tall and strong, Right blythsome roll'd his een, Sweet was his voice whene'er he sung, He scant had twenty seen. But who the countless charms can draw, That grac'd his mistress true; Such charms the old world seldom saw, Nor oft I ween the new. Her raven hair plays round her neck, Like tendrils of the vine; Her cheeks red dewy rose buds deck, Her eyes like diamonds shine. Soon as his well-known ship she spied, She cast her weeds away, And to the palmy shore she hied, All in her best array. In sea-green silk so neatly clad, She there impatient stood; The crew with wonder saw the lad Repell the foaming flood. Her hands a handkerchief display'd, Which he at parting gave; Well pleas'd the token he survey'd, And manlier beat the wave. Her fair companions one and all, Rejoicing crowd the strand; For now her lover swam in call, And almost touch'd the land. Then through the white surf did she haste, To clasp her lovely swain; When, ah! a shark bit through his waste: His heart's blood dy'd the main! He shriek'd! his half sprang from the wave, Streaming with purple gore, And soon it found a living grave, And ah! was seen no more. Now haste, now haste, ye maids, I pray, Fetch water from the spring: She falls, she swoons, she dies away, And soon her knell they ring. Now each May morning round her tomb Ye fair, fresh flowerets strew, So may your lovers scape his doom, Her hapless fate scape you. XVII. GENTLE RIVER, GENTLE RIVER. Translated from the Spanish. Although the English are remarkable for the number and variety of their ancient Ballads, and retain perhap sa greater fondness for these old simple rhapsodies of their ancestors, than most other nations; they are not the only people who have distinguished themselves by compositions of this kind. The Spaniards have great multitudes of them, many of which are of the highest merit. They call them in their language Romances, and have collected them into volumes under the titles of El Romancero, El Cancionero i. e. The ballad-singer., &amp;c. Most of them relate to their conflicts with the Moors, and display a spirit of gallantry peculiar to that romantic people. But of all the Spanish ballads, none exceed in poetical merit those inserted in a little Spanish “History of the civil wars of Granada,” describing the dissensions which raged in that last seat of Moorish empire before it was conquered in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, in 1491. In this History (or perhaps, Romance) a great number of heroic songs are inserted and appealed to as authentic vouchers for the truth of facts. In reality, the prose narrative seems to be drawn up for no other end, but to introduce and illustrate these beautiful pieces. The Spanish editor pretends (how truly I know not) that they are translations from the Arabic or Morisco language. Indeed the plain unadorned nature of the verse, and the native simplicity of language and sentiment, which runs through these poems, prove that they are ancient; or, at least, that they were written before the Castillians began to form themselves on the model of the Tuscan poets, and had imported from Italy that fondness for conceit and refinement, which has for these two centuries past so miserably infected the Spanish poetry, and rendered it so unnatural, affected, and obscure. As a specimen of the ancient Spanish manner, which very much resembles that of our old English Bards and Minstrels, the Reader is desired candidly to accept the two following poems. They are given from a small Collection of pieces of this kind, which the Editor some years ago translated for his amusement when he was studying the Spanish language. As the first is a pretty close translation, to gratify the curious it is accompanied with the original. The Metre is the same in all these old Spanish songs: and its plain unpolished nature strongly argues its great antiquity. It runs in short stanzas of four lines, of which the second and fourth alone correspond in their terminations; and in these it is only required that the vowels should be alike, the consonants may be altogether different, as pone casa meten arcos noble cañs muere gamo. Yet has this kind of verse a sort of simple harmonious flow, which atones for the imperfect nature of the rhyme, and renders it not unpleasing to the ear. The same flow of numbers has been studied in the following versions. The first of them is given from two different originals, both of which are printed in the Hist. de las civiles guerras de Granada. Mad. 1694. One of them hath the rhymes ending in AA, the other in IA. They both of them begin with the same line, Rio verde, rio verde Literally, Green river, green river., which could not be translated faithfully; Verdant river, verdant river, would have given an affected stiffness to the verse; the great merit of which is its easy simplicity; and therefore a more simple epithet was adopted, though less poetical or expressive. Gentle river, gentle river, Lo, thy streams are stain'd with gore, Many a brave and noble captain Floats along thy willow'd shore. All beside thy limpid waters, All beside thy sands so bright, Moorish Chiefs and Christian Warriors Join'd in fierce and mortal fight. Lords, and dukes, and noble princes On thy fatal banks were slain: Fatal banks that gave to slaughter All the pride and flower of Spain. There the hero, brave Alonzo Full of wounds and glory died: There the fearless Urdiales Fell a victim by his side. Lo! where yonder Don Saavedra Thro' the squadrons slow retires; Proud Seville, his native city, Proud Seville his worth admires. Close behind a renegado Loudly shouts with taunting cry; Yield thee, yield thee, Don Saavedra, Dost thou from the battle fly? Well I know thee, haughty Christian, Long I liv'd beneath thy roof; Oft I've in the lists of glory Seen thee win the prize of proof. Well I know thy aged parents, Well thy blooming bride I know; Seven years I was thy captive, Seven years of pain and woe. May our prophet grant my wishes, Haughty chief, thou shalt be mine: Thou shalt drink that cup of sorrow, Which I drank when I was thine. Like a lion turns the warrior, Back he sends an angry glare: Whizzing came the Moorish javelin, Vainly whizzing thro' the air. Back the hero full of fury Sent a deep and mortal wound: Instant sunk the Renegado, Mute and lifeless on the ground. With a thousand Moors surrounded, Brave Saavedra stands at bay: Wearied out but never daunted, Cold at length the warrior lay. Near him fighting great Alonzo Stout resists the Paynim bands; From his slaughter'd steed dismounted Firm intrench'd behind him stands Furious press the hostile squadron, Furious he repels their rage; Loss of blood at length infeebles: Who can war with thousands wage! Where yon rock the plain o'ershadows Close beneath its foot retir'd, Fainting sunk the bleeding hero, And without a groan expir'd. In the Spanish original of the foregoing ballad, follow a few more stanzas, but being of inferior merit were not translated. Renegado properly signifies an apostate; but it is sometimes used to express an infidel in general; as it seems to do above in ver. 21. &amp;c. The image of the Lion, &amp;c. in ver. 37. is taken from the other Spanish copy, the rhymes of which end in IA, viz, ‘Sayavedra, que lo oyera, ‘Como un leon rebolbia.’ XVIII. ALCANZOR AND ZAYDA, A Moorish Tale, Imitated from the Spanish. The foregoing version was rendered as literal as the nature of the two languages would admit. In the following a wider compass hath been taken. The Spanish poem that was chiefly had in view, is preserved in the same history of the Civil wars of Granada, f. 22. and begins with these lines, ‘Por la calle de su dama ‘Passeando se anda, &amp;c.’ Softly blow the evening breezes, Softly fall the dews of night; Yonder walks the Moor Alcanzor, Shunning every glare of light. In yon palace lives fair Zaida, Whom he loves with flame so pure: Loveliest she of Moorish ladies; He a young and noble Moor. Waiting for the appointed minute, Oft he paces to and fro; Stopping now, now moving forwards, Sometimes quick, and sometimes slow. Hope and fear alternate teize him, Oft he sighs with heart-felt care.— See, fond youth, to yonder window Softly steps the timorous fair. Lovely seems the moon's fair lustre To the lost benighted swain, When all silvery bright she rises, Gilding mountain, grove, and plain. Lovely seems the sun's full glory. To the fainting seaman's eyes, When some horrid storm dispersing, O'er the wave his radiance flies. But a thousand times more lovely To her longing lover's sight Steals half-seen the beauteous maiden Thro' the glimmerings of the night. Tip-toe stands the anxious lover, Whispering forth a gentle sigh: Alla Alla is the Mahometan name of God. keep thee, lovely lady; Tell me, am I doom'd to die? Is it true the dreadful story, Which thy damsel tells my page, That seduc'd by sordid riches Thou wilt sell thy bloom to age? An old lord from Antiquera Thy stern father brings along; But canst thou, inconstant Zaida, Thus consent my love to wrong? If 'tis true now plainly tell me, Nor thus trifle with my woes; Hide not then from me the secret, Which the world so clearly knows. Deeply sigh'd the conscious maiden, While the pearly tears descend: Ah! my lord, too true the story; Here our tender loves must end. Our fond friendship is discover'd, Well are known our mutual vows; All my friends are full of fury; Storms of passion shake the house. Threats, reproaches, fears surround me; My stern father breaks my heart; Alla knows how dear it costs me, Generous youth, from thee to part. Ancient wounds of hostile fury Long have rent our house and thine; Why then did thy shining merit Win this tender heart of mine? Well thou know'st how dear I lov'd thee Spite of all their hateful pride, Tho' I fear'd my haughty father Ne'er would let me be thy bride. Well thou know'st what cruel chidings Oft I've from my mother borne, What I've suffered here to meet thee Still at eve and early morn. I no longer may resist them; All, to force my hand combine; And to-morrow to thy rival This weak frame I must resign. Yet think not thy faithful Zaida Can survive so great a wrong; Well my breaking heart assures me That my woes will not be long. Farewell then, my dear Alcanzor! Farewell too my life with thee! Take this scarf a parting token; When thou wear'st it think on me. Soon, lov'd youth, some worthier maiden Shall reward thy generous truth; Sometimes tell her how thy Zaida Died for thee in prime of youth. —To him all amaz'd, confounded, Thus she did her woes impart: Deep he sigh'd, then cry'd, O Zaida, Do not, do not break my heart. Canst thou think I thus will lose thee? Canst thou hold my love so small? No! a thousand times I'll perish!— My curst rival too shall fall. Canst thou, wilt thou yield thus to them? O break, forth, and fly to me! This fond heart shall bleed to save thee, These fond arms shall shelter thee. 'Tis in vain, in vain, Alcanzor, Spies surround me, bars secure; Scarce I steal this last dear moment, While my damsel keeps the door. Hark, I hear my father storming! Hark, I hear my mother chide! I must go: farewell for ever! Gracious Alla be thy guide! THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK. THE END OF VOLUME THE FIRST.</field>

More solid things do not shew the complexion of the times so well as Ballads and Libels. Selden's Table-talk. ANCIENT SONGS AND BALLADS, &amp;c. SERIES THE SECOND. BOOK I. I. RICHARD OF ALMAIGNE “A ballad made by one of the adherents to Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, soon after the battle of Lewes, which was fought May 14, 1264,” — affords a curious specimen of ancient Satire, and shews that the liberty, assumed by the good people of this realm, of abusing their kings and princes at pleasure, is a privilege of very long standing. To render this antique libel intelligible, the reader is to understand that just before the battle of Lewes which proved so fatal to the interests of Henry III. the barons had offered his brother Richard King of the Romans 30,000 l. to procure a peace upon such terms, as would have divested Henry of all his regal power, and therefore the treaty proved abortive.—The consequences of that battle are well known: the king, prince Edward his son, his brother Richard, and many of his friends fell into the hands of their enemies: while two great barons of the king's party, John earl of Warren, and Hugh Bigot the king's Justiciary, had been glad to escape into France. In the 1st stanza the aforesaid sum of thirty thousand pounds is alluded to, but with the usual misrepresentation of party malevolence, is asserted to have been the exorbitant demand of the king's brother. With regard to the 2d st. the Reader is to note that Richard, along with the earldom of Cornwall, had the honours of Walingford and Eyre confirmed to him on his marriage with Sanchia daughter of the Count of Provence, in 1243.—Windsor castle was the chief fortress belonging to the king, and had been garrisoned by foreigners: a circumstance, which furnishes out the burthen of each stanza. The 2d st. very humorously alludes to some little fact, which history hath not condescended to record. Earl Richard possessed some large water-mills near Istleworth, which had been plundered and burnt by the Londoners: in these perhaps by way of defence he had lodged a party of soldiers. The 4th st. is of obvious interpretation: Richard, who had been elected king of the Romans in 1256, and had afterwards gone over to take possession of his dignity, was in the year 1250 about to return into England, when the barons raised a popular clamour, that he was bringing with him foreigners to over-run the kingdom: upon which he was forced to dismiss almost all his followers, otherwise the barons would have opposed his landing. In the 5th st. the writer regrets the escape of the Earl of Warren, and in the 6th and 7th sts. insinuates that if he and Sir Hugh Bigot once fell into the hands of their adversaries, they should never more return home. A circumstance, which fixes the date of this ballad; for in the year 126; both these noblemen landed in South Wales, and the royal party soon after gained the ascendant. See Holingshed, Rapin, &amp;c. The following is copied from a very ancient MS. in the British Museum. [Harl. MSS. 2253. s. 23.] This MS. is judged, from the peculiarities of the writing, to be not later than the time of Richard II; th being every where expressed by the character þ; the y is pointed after the Saxon manner, and the í hath an oblique stroke over it. Prefixed to this ancient libel on government is a small design, which the engraver intended should correspond with the subject. On the one side a Satyr, (emblem of Petulance and Ridicule) is trampling on the ensigns of Royalty; on the other Faction under the masque of Liberty is exciting Ignorance and Popular Rage to deface the Royal Image; which stands on a pedestal inscribed magna charta, to denote that the rights of the king, as well as those of the people, are founded on the laws; and that to attack one, is in effect to demolish both.

The Series of Poems given in this volume will shew the gradual changes of the English Language thro' a succession of five hundred years. This and the following article may be considered as specimens of it in its most early state, almost as soon as it ceased to be Saxon. Indeed the annals of this kingdom are written in the Saxon language almost down to the end of K. Stephen's reign: for so far reaches the Saxon Chronicle; within little more than a century of the date of this poem. II. ON THE DEATH OF K. EDWARD THE FIRST. We have here an early attempt at Elegy. Edward I. died July 7. 1307, in the 35th year of his reign, and 60th of his age. This poem appears to have been composed soon after his death. According to the modes of thinking peculiar to those times, the writer dwells more upon his devotion, than his skill in government, and pays less attention to the martial and political abilities of this great monarch, in which he had no equal, than to some little weaknesses of superstition, which he had in common with all his cotemporaries. The king had in the decline of life vowed an expedition to the holy land, but finding his end approach, he dedicated the sum of 32,000 l. to the maintenance of a large body of knights (140 say historians, 80 says our poet,) who were to carry his heart with them into Palestine. This dying command of the king was never performed. Our poet with the honest prejudices of an Englishman, attributes this failure to the advice of the king of France, whose daughter Isabel our young monarch immediately married. But the truth is, Edward and his destructive favourite Piers Gaveston spent the money upon their pleasures.—To do the greater honour to the memory of his heroe, our poet puts his eloge in the mouth of the Pope; with the some poetic licence, as a more modern bard would have introduced Britannia, or the Genius of Europe pouring forth his praises. This antique Elegy is extracted from the same MS volume, as the preceding article; is found with the same peculiarities of writing and orthography; and tho' written at near the distance of half a century contains little or no variation of idiom: whereas the next following poem by Chaucer, which was probably written not more than 50 or 60 years after this, exhibits almost a new language. This seems to countenance the opinion of some antiquaries, that this great poet made considerable innovations in his mother tongue, and introduced many terms, and new modes of speech from other languages.

That lasteth ay withouten ende, Bidde we God, ant oure Ledy to thilke blisse. Jesus us sende. Amen. III. AN ORIGINAL BALLAD BY CHAUCER. This little sonnet, which hath escaped all the editors of Chaucer's works, is now printed for the first time from an ancient MS in the Pepysian library, that contains many other poems of its venerable author. The versification is of that species, which the French call Rondeau, very naturally englished by our honest countrymen Round O. Tho' so early adopted by them, our ancestors had not the honour of inventing it: Chaucer picked it up, along with other better things, among the neighbouring nations. A fondness for laborious trifles hath always prevailed in the dawn of literature. The ancient Greek poets had their wings and axes: the great father of English poesy may therefore be pardoned one poor solitary rondeau.—Dan Geofrey Chaucer died Oct. 25. 1400. aged 72. I. 1 Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly, I may the beaute of them not sustene, So wendeth it thorowout my herte kene. 2 And but your words will helen hastely My hertis wound, while that it is grene, Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly. 3 Upon my trouth I sey yow feithfully, That ye ben of my liffe and deth the quene; For with my deth the trouth shal be sene. Youre two eyn, &amp;c. II. 1 So hath youre beauty fro your herte chased Pitee, that me n' availeth not to pleyn; For daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne. 2 Giltless my deth thus have ye purchased; I sey yow soth, me nedeth not to fayn: So hath your beaute fro your herte chased. 3 Alas, that nature hath in yow compassed So grete beaute, that no man may atteyn To mercy, though he sterve for the peyn. So hath youre beaute, &amp;c. III. 1 Syn I fro love escaped am so fat, I nere thinke to ben in his prison lene; Syn I am fre, I counte hym not a bene. 2 He may answere, and sey this and that, I do no sors, I speak ryght as I mene; Syn I fro love escaped am so fat. 3 Love hath my name i-strike out of his sclat, And he is strike out of my bokes clene: For ever mo Ther. this is non other mene. Syn I fro love escaped, &amp;c. IV. THE TURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM: “or, the wooeing, winning, and wedding of Tibbe, the Reev's daughter there.” It does honour to the good sense of this nation, that while all Europe was captivated with the bewitching charms of Chivalry and Romance, two of our writers in the rudest times could see thro' the false glare that surrounded them, and discover whatever was absurd in them both. Chaucer wrote his Rhyme of sir Thopas in ridicule of the latter, and in the following poem we have a humourous burlesque of the former. Without pretending to decide, whether the institution of chivalry was upon the whole useful or pernicious in the rude ages, a question that has lately employed many fine pens See [Mr. Hurd's] Letters on Chivalry, 8vo. 1762. Memoires de la Chevalierie par M. de la Curne des Palais, 1759. 2 tom. 12 mo. &amp;c., it evidently encouraged a vindictive spirit, and gave such force to the custom of duelling, that it will probably never be worn out. This, together with the fatal consequences which often attended the diversion of the Turnament, was sufficient to render it obnoxious to the graver part of mankind. Accordingly the Church early denounced its censures against it, and the State was often prevailed on to attempt its suppression. But fashion and opinion are superior to authority; and the proclamations against Tilting were as little regarded in those times, as the laws against Duelling are in these. This did not escape the discernment of our poet, who easily perceived that inveterate opinions must be attacked by other weapons, than proclamations and censures; he accordingly made use of the keen one of Ridicule. With this view he has here introduced, with admirable humour, a parcel of clowns, imitating all the solemnities of the Tournay. Here we have the regular challenge—the appointed day—the lady for the prize—the formal preparations—the display of armour—the scucheens and devices—the oaths taken on entering the lists—the various accidents of the encounter—the victor leading off the prize,—and, the magnificent feasting,—with all the other solemn fopperïes, that usually attended the exercise of the barriers. And how acutely the sharpness of the author's humour must have been felt in those days, we may learn, from what we can perceive of its keenness now, when time has so much blunted the edge of his ridicule. The Turnament of Tottenham was published from an ancient MS. in 1631, 4to, by the rew. Whilhem Bedwell, rector of Tottenham, and one of the translators of the Bible: he tells us it was written by one Gilbert Pilkington, thought to have been some time parson of the same parish, and author of another piece intitled Passio Domini Jesu Christi. Bedwell, who was eminently skilled in the oriental languages, appears to have been but little conversant with the ancient writers in his own, and he so little entered into the spirit of the poem he was publishing that he contends for its being a serious narrative of a real event, and thinks it must have been written before the time of Edward III, because Turnaments were prohibited in that reign. “I do verily beleeve, says he, that this Turnament was acted before this proclamation of K. Edward. For how durst any to attempt to do that, although in sport, which was so straightly forbidden, both by the civill and ecclesiasticall power? For although they fought not with lances, yet, as our authour sayth, “It was no childrens game.” And what would have become of him, thinke you, which should have slayne another in this manner of jeasting? Would he not, trow you, have been hang'd for it in earnest? yea, and have bene buried like a dogge?” It is however well known that Turnaments were in use down to the reign of Elizabeth. Without pretending to ascertain the date of this Poem, the obsoleteness of the style shews it to be very ancient: It will appear from the sameness of orthography in the above extract that Bedwell has generally reduced that of the poem to the standard of his own times; yet, notwithstanding this innovation, the phraseology and idiom shew it to be of an early date. The poem had in other respects suffered by the ignorance of transcribers, and therefore a few attempts are here made to restore the text, by amending some corruptions, and removing some redundancies; but lest this freedom should incur censure, the former readings are retained in the margin. A farther liberty is also taken, what is here given for the concluding line of each stanza, stood in the former edition divided as two: e. g. “Of them that were doughty, “And hardy indeed:” but they seemed most naturally to run into one, and the frequent neglect of rhyme in the former of them seemed to prove that the author intended no such division. Of all ‘the’ kene conquerours to carpe is our kinde; these. P. C. Of fell fighting folke ‘a’ ferly we finde; ‘a’ not in P. C. The Turnament of Tottenham have I in minde; indeed. P. C. It were harme such hardinesse were holden behinde. In story as we reade, Of Hawkin, of Harry, Of Timkin, of Terry, Of them that were doughty, and hardy in deed. It befell in Tottenham on a deare day, There was made a shurting by the highway: Thither come all the men of that countray Of Hisselton, of High-gate, and of Hakenay, And all the sweete swinkers: There hopped Hawkin, There daunced Dawkin, There trumped Timkin, and were true drinkers. ‘When’ the day was gone, and eve-song past, Till. P. C. That they should reck'n their skot, and their counts cast, Perkin the potter into the presse past, And say'd, Randill the reve, a daughter thou hast, Tibbe thy deare, Therefore faine weet would I, Whether these fellowes or I, Or which of all this batchelery Were the best worthy to wed her his fere. in his fere. P. C. Upstart the gadlings with their lang staves, And sayd, Randill the reve, lo! the ladde raves, How proudly among us thy daughter he craves, And we are richer men then he, and more good haves, Of cattell, and of corne. The latter part of this stanza seemed embarrassed and redundant, we have therefore ventured to contract it. It stood thus; Then sayd Perkin, to Tibbe I have hight That I will bee alwaies ready in my right, With a flayle for to fight This day seaven-night, and thought it were to morne. The two last lines seem in part to be borrowed from the following stanza, where they come in more properly.Then sayd Perkin, ‘I have hight ‘To Tibbe in my right ‘To be ready to fight, and thoughe it were to morne. Then sayd Randill the refe, ‘Ever’ be he waryd Every. P. C. That about this carping lenger would be taryd; I would not my daughter that she were miskaryd, But at her most worship I would she were maryd, For the turnament shall beginne This day seav'n-night, With a flayle for to fight, And he, that is most of might, shall brok her with winne. He that bear'th him best in the turnament, Shall be granted the gree, by the common assent, For to winne my daughter with doughtinesse of dent, And Copple my brood-hen, that was brought out of Kent, And my dunned cow: For no spence will I spare; For no cattell will I care; He shall have my gray mare, and my spotted sow. There was many a bold lad their bodyes to bede; Then they take their leave, and hamward they hede, And all the weeke after they gayed her wede, her, i. e. their. Till it come to the day, that they should do their dede: They armed them in mattes; They set on their nowlls Good blacke bowlls, To keep their powlls from battering of battes. They sewed hem in sheepskinnes, for they should not brest; And every ilke of hem a black hatte, instead of a crest, ilken. P. C. A basket or panyer before on their brest, And a flayle in their hande, for to fight prest, Forthe con they fare. There was kid mickle force, Who should best fend his corse; He, that had no good horse, borrowed him a mare. Mares were never used in Chivalry: It was beneath the dignity of a knight to ride any thing but a stallion. V. Memoires de la Chevalerie. Sich another clothing have I not seene oft, When all the great company riding to the croft, perhaps, rid into. Tibbe on a gray-mare was sette up on-loft, Upon a sacke-full of senvy, for she should sit soft, And led till the gappe: Forther would she not than, For the love of no man, Till Copple her brood-hen wer brought into her lappe. A gay girdle Tibbe had borrowed for the nonce; And a garland on her head full of ruell bones; And a brouch on her brest full of sapphyre stones, The holyroode tokening was written for the nonce; For no spendings ‘they had spar'd:’ would they spare. P. C. When jolly Jenkin wist her thare, He gurd so fast his gray mare, That she let a fowkin fare at the rere-ward. I make a vowe, quoth ‘he, my capul’ is comen of kinde Originally it stood thus, I make a vowe, quoth Tibbe, copple is comen of kinde; but as this evidently has no connection with the lines that follow, the Editor proposes the above emendation. I shall fall five in the field, and I my flaile finde. I make a vowe, quoth Hudde, I shall not leve behinde; May I meet with lyard or bayard the blinde, I wote I shall them grieve. I make a vowe, quoth Hawkin, May I meete with Dawkin, For all his rich kin, his flaile I shall him reve. I make a vow, quoth Gregge, Tibbe thou shall see Which of all the bachelery graunted is the gree: I shall skomfit hem all, for the love of thee, In what place that I come, they shall have doubt of mee; For I am armd at the full: In my armes I beare wele A dough-trough, and a pele, A saddle without a pannele, with a fleece of wooll. Now go downe, quoth Dudman, and beare me bet about, Perhaps ‘I shall’ go downe. I make a vow, they shall abye that I finde out, Have I twice or thrice ridden thorough the rout, In what place that I come, of me they shall ha doubt, Mine armes bene so clere; I beare a riddle and a rake, Powder'd with the brenning drake, And three cantles of a cake, in ilka cornere. I make a vowe, quoth Tirry, and sweare by my crede, Saw thou never young boy forther his body bede; For when they fight fastest, and most are in drede, I shall take Tib by the hand, and away her lede: Then bin mine armes best; I beare a pilch of ermin, Powderd with a cats skinne, The cheefe is of perchmine pechmine. P. C., that stond'th on the crest. I make a vow, quoth Dudman, and sweare by the stra, While I am most merry, thou gettst her not swa; For she is well shapen, as light as a rae, There is no capull in this mile before her will ga: Shee will me not beguile; I dare soothly say, Shee will be a Monday Fro Hisselton to Hacknay, nought other halfe mile. I make a vow, quoth Perkin, thou carpst of cold rost; I will wirke wislier without any boast; Five of the best capulls, that are in this host, I will hem lead away by another cost; And then laugh Tibbe, Wi loo, boyes, here is hee, We loo. P. C. That will fight and not flee, For I am in my jollity; Ioo foorth, Tibbe. When they had their oathes made, forth can they ‘he’ te. P. C. With flailes, and harnisse, and trumps made of tre: There were all the bachelers of that countre; They were dight in aray, as themselves would be: Their banner was full bright, Of an old rotten fell, The cheese was a plowmell, And the shadow of a bell, quartered with the moone-light. I wot it was no childrens game, when they togither mette, When ilka freke in the field on his fellow bette, And layd on stifly, for nothing would they lette, And fought ferly fast, till ‘theire’ horses swette; here. P. C. 8. And few wordes were spoken: There were flailes all to slatterd, There were shields all to clatterd, Bowles and dishes all to batterd, and many heads broken. heads therewere. There was clenking of cart-saddles, and clattering of cannes, Of fell frekes in the field, broken were their fannes; Of some were the heads broken, of some the braine-pannes, And evill were they besene, ere they went thance, With swipping of swipples: The ladds were so weary for fought, That they might fight no more on-loft, But creeped about in the croft, as they were crooked cripples. Perkin was so weary, that he beganne to lowte, Help, Hudde, I am dead in this ilk rowte: An horse for forty pennys, a good and a stowte; That I may lightly come of mine owne owte; For no cost will I spare. He starte up as a snaile, And hent a capull by the taile, And raught of Daukin his flayle, and wanne him a mare. Perkin wan five, and Hudde wan twa: Glad and blithe they were, that they ‘had’ done sa: They would have them to Tibbe, and present her with tha: would not have. P. C. The capuls were so weary, that they might not ga, But still can they ‘stonde.’ stand. P. C. Alas! quoth Hudde, my joy I leese Mee had lever then a stone of cheese, That deare Tibbe had all these, and wist it were my sonde. Perkin turned him about in the ilk throng, He fought freshly, for he had rest him long; He was ware of Tirry take Tibbe by the hond, And would have led her away with a love-song; And Perkin after ran, And off his capull he him drowe, And gave him of his flayle inowe; Then te, he! quoth Tibbe, and lowe, ye are a doughty man. Thus they tugged, and they rugged till it was nigh night: All the wives of Tottenham come to see that fight; To fetch home their husbands, that were them trough plight, With wispes and kixes, that was a rich sight; Her husbands home to fetch. her, i. e. their. And some they had in armes, That were feeble wretches, And some on wheel-barrowes, and some on critches. They gatherd Perkin about on every side, And grant him there the gree, the more was his pride: Tib and hee, with great mirth, hameward can ride, And were all night togither, till the morrow tide; And to church they went: So well his needs he has sped, That deare Tibbe he shall wed; The cheefemen that her hither lead, were of the turnament. To the rich feast come many for the nonce: Some come hop-halte, and some tripping thither on the stones; Some with a staffe in his hand, and some two at once; Of some were the headsbroken; of some the shoulderbones: With sorrow come they thither; Wo was Hawkin; wo was Harry; Wo was Tymkin; wo was Tirry; And so was all the company, but yet they come togither. At that feast were they served in rich aray; Every five and five had a cokeney; And so they sat in jollity all the long day. Tibbe at night, I trowe, had a simple aray; Mickle mirth was them among: In every corner of the house Was melody delicious, For to hear precious of six mens song. V. FOR THE VICTORY AT AGINCOURT. That our plain and martial ancestors could wield their swords much better than their pens, will appear from the following homely Rhymes, which were drawn up by some poet laureat of those days to celebrate the immortal victory gained at Agincourt, Oct. 25, 1415. This song or hymn is given meerly as a curiosity, and is printed from a MS copy in the Pepys collection, vol. I. folio. It is there accompanied with the musical notes, which are copied in a small plate at the end of this volume. Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria! Owre kynge went forth to Normandy, With grace and myzt of chivalry; The God for hym wrouzt marvelously, Wherefore Englonde may calle, and cry Deo gratias: Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria. He sette a sege, the sothe for to say, To Harflue toune with ryal aray; That toune he wan, and made a fray, That Fraunce shall rywe tyl domes day. Deo gratias, &amp;c. Then went owre kynge, with alle his oste, Thorowe Fraunce for all the Frenshe boste; He spared ‘for’ drede of leste, ne most, Tyl he come to Agincourt coste. Deo gratias, &amp;c. Than for sothe that knyzt comely In Agincourt feld he fauzt manly, Thorow grace of God most myzty He had bothe the felde, and the victory. Deo gratias, &amp;c. Ther dukys, and erlys, lorde and barone, Were take, and slayne, and that wel sone, And some were ledde in to Lundone With joye, and merthe, and grete renone. Deo gratias, &amp;c. Now gracious God he save owre kynge, His peple, and all his wel wyllynge, Gef him gode lyfe, and gode endynge, That we with merth mowe savely synge Deo gratias: Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria. VI. THE NOT-BROWNE MAYD. The sentimental beauties of this ancient ballad have always recommended it to Readers of taste, not withstanding the rust of antiquity, which obscures the style and expression. Indeed if it had no other merit, than the having afforded the groundwork to Prior's Henry and Emma, this ought to preserve it from oblivion. That we are able to give it in a more correct manner; than almost any other Poem in these volumes, is owing to the great care and exactness of the accurate Editor of the Prolusions 8vo. 1760; who has formed the text from two copies found in two different editions of Arnolde's Chronicle, a book supposed to be first printed about 1521. From the correct Copy in the Prolusions the following is printed, with a few additional improvements gathered from another edition of Arnolde's book This (which a learned friend supposes to be the first Edition) is in folio: the folios are numbered at the bottom of the leaf: the Song begins at folio 75. preserved in the public Library at Cambridge. All the various readings of this Copy will be found here, either received into the text, or noted in the margin. The references to the Prolusions will shew where they occur. It does honour to the critical sagacity of that gentleman, that almost all his conjectural readings are found to be the established ones of this edition. In our ancient folio MS. described in the preface is a very corrupt and defective copy of this ballad, which yet afforded a great improvement in one line that will be found in its due place. It has been a much easier task to settle the text of this poem, than to ascertain its date. Mat. Prior published it in the folio edition of his poems, 1718, as then “300 years old.” In making this decision he was probably guided by the learned Wanley, whose judgment in matters of this nature was most consummate. For that whatever related to the reprinting of this old piece was referred to Wanley, appears from two letters of Prior's preserved in the British Museum [Harl. MSS. N? 3777.] The Editor of the Prolusions thinks it cannot be older than the year 1500, because in Sir Thomas More's tale of The Serjeant, &amp;c. which was written about that time, there appears a sameness of rhythmus and orthography, and a very near affinity of words and phrases with those of this ballad. But this reasoning is not conclusive; for if Sir Thomas More made this ballad his model, as is very likely, that will account for the sameness of measure, and in some respect for that of words and phrases, even tho' this had been written long before: and as for the orthography, it is well known that the old Printers reduced that of most books to the standard of their own times. Indeed it is hardly probable that an antiquarian like Arnolde would have inserted it among his historical Collections, if it had been then a modern piece; at least he would have been apt to have named its author. But to shew how little can be inferred from a resemblance of rhythmus or style, the editor of these volumes has in his ancient folio MS. a poem on the Victory of Floddenfield, written in the same numbers, with the same alliterations, and in orthography, phraseology, and style nearly resembling the Visions of Pierce Plowman, which are yet known to have been composed above 160 years before that battle. As this poem is a great curiosity, we shall give a few of the introductory lines, “Grant gracious God, grant me this time, “That I may 'say, or I cease, thy selven to please; “And Mary his mother, that maketh this world; “And all the seemlie saints, that sitten in heaven; “I will carpe of kings, that conquered full wide, “That dwelled in this land, that was alyes noble; “Henry the seventh, that soveraigne lord, &amp;c. With regard to the date of the following ballad, we have taken a middle course, neither placed it so high as Wanley and Prior, nor quite so low as the editor of the Prolusions: we should have followed the latter in dividing every other line into two, but that the whole would then have taken up more room, than could be allowed it in this volume. Be it ryght, or wrong, these men among On women do complayne; Woman. Prolusions. Affyrmynge this, how that it is A labour spent in vayne, To love them wele; for never a dele They love a man agayne: For late a man do what he can, Theyr favour to attayne, Yet, yf a newe do them persue, Theyr first true lover than Laboureth for nought; for from her thought her. i. e. their.

I say nat, nay, but that all day It is bothe writ and sayd That womans faith is, as who sayth, All utterly decayd; But, neverthelesse, ryght good wytnèsse In this case might be layd, That they love true, and continùe: Recorde the not-browne mayde: Which, when her love came, her to prove, To her to make his mone, Wolde nat depart; for in her hart She loved but hym alone.

And I your wyll for to fulfyll In this wyll nat refuse; Trustying to shewe, in wordès fewe, That men have an yll use (To theyr own shame) women to blame, And causelesse them accuse: Therfore to you I answere nowe, All women to excuse,— Myne owne hart dere, with you what chere? I pray you, tell anone; For, in my mynde, of all mankynde I love but you alone. He. It standeth so; a dede is do Wherof grete harme shall growe: My destiny is for to dy A shamefull deth, I trowe; Or elles to fle: the one must be; None other way I knowe, But to withdrawe as an outlawe, And take me to my bowe. Wherfore, adue, my owne hart true! None other rede I can; For I must to the grene wode go, Alone, a banyshed man. She. O lord, what is this worldys blysse, That changeth as the mone!

Why sholde ye ought? for, to make thought, Your labour were in vayne. And thus I do; and pray you to, As hartely, as I can; For I must to the grene wode go, Alone, a banyshed man. She. Now, syth that ye have shewed to me The secret of your mynde, I shall be playne to you agayne, Lyke as ye shall me fynde: Syth it is so, that ye wyll go, I wolle not leve behynde; Shall never be sayd, the not-browne mayd Shall it never.

The amiable light, in which the character of Anthony Widville the gallant Earl Rivers has been placed by the elegant Author of the Catal. of Noble Writers, interests us in whatever fell from his pen. It is presumed therefore that the insertion of this little Sonnet will be pardoned, tho' it should not be found to have much poetical merit. It is the only original Poem known of that nobleman's; his more voluminous works being only translations. And if we consider that it was written during his cruel confinement in Pomfret castle a short time before his execution in 1483, it gives us a fine picture of the composure and steadiness with which this stout earl beheld his approaching fate. The verses are preserved by Rouse a contemporary historian, who seems to have copied them from the Earl's own hand writing. In tempore, says this writer, incarcerationis apud Pontem-fractum edidit unum Balet in anglicis, ut mihi monstratum est, quod subsequitur sub his verbis: Sum what musyng, &amp;c. “Rossi Hist. 8vo. 2 Edit. p. 213.” The 2d Stanza is, notwithstanding, imperfect, and we have inserted asterisks, to denote the defect. This little piece, which perhaps ought rather to have been printed in stanzas of eight short lines, is written in imitation of a poem of Chaucer's, that will found in Urry's Edit. 1721. pag. 555. beginning thus, “Alone walkyng, In thought plainyng, “And sore sighying, All desolate. “Me remembrying of my livyng “My death wishyng Bothe erly and late. “Infortunate Is so my fate “That wote ye what, Out of mesure “My life I hate; Thus desperate “In such pore estate, Doe I endure, &amp;c.” Sumwhat musyng, and more mornyng, In remembring the unstydfastnes; This world being of such whelyng, Me contrarieng, what may I gesse?

Wyllyng to dye, me thynkys truly Bowndyn am I, and that gretly, to be content: Seyng playnly, that fortune doth wry All contrary from myn entent. My lyff was lent me to on intent, Hytt is ny spent.

The Reader will think that infant Poetry grew apace between the times of Rivers and Vaux, tho' nearly contemporaries; if the following Song is the composition of that Sir Nicholas (afterwards Lord) Vaux, who was the shining ornament of the court of Henry VII. and died in the year 1523. And yet to this Lord it is attributed by Puttenham in his “Art of Eng. Poesie, 1589. 4to.” a writer commonly well informed: take the passage at large. “In this figure [Counterfait Action] the Lord Nicholas Vaux, a noble gentleman and much delighted in vulgar making, and a man otherwise of no great learning, but having herein a marvelous facilitie, made a dittie representing the Battayle and Assault of Cupide, so excellently well, as for the gallant and propre application of his fiction in every part, I cannot choose but set downe the greatest part of his ditty, for in truth it cannot be amended. When Cupid scaled, &amp;c.” p. 200.—For a father account in Nicholas Lord Vaux see Mr. Walpole's Noble Authors, Vol. 1. The following Copy is printed from the first Edit. of Surrey's Poems, 1557, 4to. —See another Song of Lord Vaux's in the preceeding Vol. Book II. No. II. When Cupide scaled first the fort, Wherin my hart lay wounded sore; The batry was of such a sort, That I must yelde or die therfore. There sawe I Love upon the wall, How he is banner did display: Alarme, alarme, he gan to call: And bad his souldiours kepe aray. The armes, the which that Cupide bare, Were pearced hartes with teares besprent, In silver and sable to declare The stedfast love, he alwayes ment. There might you se his band all drest In colours like to white and blacke, With powder and with pelletes prest To bring the fort to spoile and sacke. Good-wyll, the maister of the shot, Stode in the rampire brave and proude, For spence of pouder he spared not Assault! assault! to crye aloude. There might you heare the cannons rore; Eche pece discharged a lovers loke; Which had the power to rent, and tore In any place whereas they toke. And even with the trumpettes sowne The scaling ladders were up set, And Beautie walked up and downe, With bow in hand, and arrowes whet. Then first Desire began to scale, And shrouded him under ‘his’ targe; so Ed. 1585. her. Ed. 1557. As one the worthiest of them all, And aptest for to geve the charge. Then pushed souldiers with their pikes, And halberders with handy strokes; The argabushe in fleshe it lightes, And duns the ayre with misty smokes. And, as it is the souldiers use When shot and powder gins to want, I hanged up my flagge of truce, And pleaded for my livès grant. When Fansy thus had made her breche, And Beauty entred with her band, With bagge and baggage, sely wretch, I yelded into Beauties hand. Then Beautie bad to blow retrete, And every souldier to retire, And Mercy wyll'd with spede to fet Me captive bound as prisoner. Madame, quoth I, sith that this day Hath served you at all assayes, I yeld to you without delay Here of the fortresse all the kayes. And sith that I have ben the marke, At whom you shot at with your eye; Nedes must you with your handy warke Or salve my sore, or let me die. Since the foregoing Song was first printed off, reasons have occurred, which incline me to believe that Lord Vaux the poet, was not the Lord Nicholas Vaux, who died in 1523, but rather a successor of his in the title.—For in the first place it is remarkable that all the old writers mention Lord Vaux the poet, as contemporary or rather posterior to Sir Thomas Wyat, and the E. of Surrey, neither of which made any figure till long after the death of the first Lord Nicholas Vaux. Thus Puttenham in his “Art of English Poesie, 1589.” in p. 48. having named Skelton, adds, “In the latter end of the same kings raigne [Henry VIII.] sprong up a new company of courtly Makers, [poets] of whom Sir Thomas Wyat th'elder, and Henry Earl of Surrey were the two chieftaines, who having travailed into Italie, and there tasted the sweet and stately measures and stile of the Italian poesie . . greatly polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poesie . . . . In the same time, or not long after was the Lord Nicholas Vaux, a man of much facilitie in vulgar makings i. e. Compositions in English..”—Webbe in his Discourse of English Poetrie, 1586. ranges them in the following order, “The E. of Surrey, the Lord Vaux, Norton, Bristow.” And Gascoigne in the place quoted in the 1st vol. of this work, [B. II. No. II.] mentions Lord Vaux after Surrey.—Again, the stile and measure of Lord Vaux's pieces seem too refined and polished for the age of Henry VII. and rather resemble the smoothness and harmony of Surrey and Wyat, than the rude metre of Skelton and Hawes:—But what puts the matter out of all doubt, in the British Museum is a copy of his poem, I lothe that I did love, [vid. vol. 1. ubi supra] with this title, “Adyttye or sonet made by the Lord Vaus, in the time of the noble Queene Marye, representing the image of Death.” Harl. MSS. No. 1703. §. 25. It is evident then that Lord Vaux the poet was not he that flourished in the reign of Henry vij. but either his son, or grandson: and yet according to Dugdale's Baronage, the former was named Thomas, and the latter William: but this difficulty is not great, for none of the old writers mention the christian name of the poetic Lord Vaux In the Paradise of Dainty Devises, 1596, he is called simply “Lord Vaux the elder.”, except Puttenham; and it is more likely that he might be mistaken in that Lord's name, than in the time in which he lived, who was so nearly his contemporary. Thomas Lord Vaux of Harrowden in Northamptonshire was summoned to parliament in 1531. When he died, does not appear; but he probably lived till the latter end of Queen Mary's reign, since his son William was not summoned to parl. till the last year of that reign, in 1558. This Lord died in 1595. See Dugdale, V. 2. p. 304.—Upon the whole I am inclined to believe that Lord Thomas was the Poet. IX. SIR ALDINGAR. This old fabulous legend is given from the Editor's folio MS, with a few conjectural emendations, and the insertion of 3 or 4 stanzas to supply defects in the original copy. It has been suggested to the Editor, that the Author of this Poem seems to have had in his eye the story of Gunhilda, who is sometimes called Eleanor, and was married to the Emperor (here called King) Henry. Our king he kept a false stewàrde, Sir Aldingar they him call; A falser steward than he was one, Servde not in bower nor hall. He wolde have layne by our comelye queene, Her deere worshippe to betraye: Our queene she was a good womàn, And evermore sayd him naye. Sir Aldingar was wrothe in his mind, With her hee was never content, Till traiterous meanes he colde devyse, In a fyer to have her brent. There came a lazar to the kings gate; A lazar both blinde and lame: He took the lazar upon his backe, And on the queenes bed him layne. “Lye still, lazàr, wheras thou lyest, “Looke thou go not hence away; “Ile make thee a whole man and a sound “In two howers of the day.” Then went him forth sir Aldingar, And hyed him to our king: “If I might have grace, as I have space, “Sad tydings I could bring.” Saye on, saye on, sir Aldingar, Saye on the soothe to mee. “Our queene hath chosen a new new love, “And shee will have none of thee. “If shee had chosen a right good knight, “The lesse had beene her shame; “But she hath chose her a lazar man, “A lazar both blinde and lame.” If this be true, sir Aldingar, The tydings thou tellest to me, Then I will make thee a riche riche knight, Riche both of golde and fee. But if it be false, sir Aldingar, As God nowe grant it bee! Thy body, I sweare by the holye rood, Shall hang on the gallows tree. He brought our king to the queenes chamber, And opend to him the dore. A lodlye love, king Henrye sayd, For our queene dame Elinore! If thou wert a man, as thou art none, Here on my sword thoust dye; But a payre of new gallowes shall now be built, And there shalt thou hang on hye. Forth then hyed our king, I wysse, And an angry man was hee; And soone he found queene Elinore, That bride so bright of bleo. Now God you save, our queene, madame, And Christ you save and see; Heere you have chosen a newe newe love, And you will have none of mee. If you had chosen a right good knight, The lesse had been your shame: But you have chose you a lazar man, A lazar both blinde and lame. Therfore a fyer there shall be built, And brent all shalt thou bee.— “Now out alacke! sayd our comlye queene, Sir Aldingar's false to mee. Now out alacke! sayd our comlye queene, My heart with griefe will brast. I had thought swevens had never beene true; I have proved them true at last. I dreamt a sweven on thursday eve, In my bed wheras I laye, I dreamt a grype and a grimlie beast Had carried my crowne awaye; My gorget and my kirtle of golde, And all my faire head-geere: And he wolde worrye me with his tush And to his nest y-beare: Saving there came a litle ‘grey’ hawke, A merlin him they call, Which untill the grounde did strike the grype, That dead he downe did fall.— Giffe I were a man, as now I am none, A battell wolde I prove, To fight with that traitor Aldingar; Att him I cast my glove. But seeing Ime able noe battell to make, My liege, grant me a knight To fight with that traitor Aldingar, To maintaine me in my right.” “Now forty dayes I will give thee To seeke thee a knight therin: If thou find not a knight in forty dayes Thy bodye it must brenn.” Then shee sent east, and shee sent west, By north and south bedeene: But never a champion colde she find, Wolde fight with that knight soe keene. Now twenty dayes were spent and gone, Noe helpe there might be had; Many a teare shed our comelye queene And aye her hart was sad. Then came one of the queenes damsèlles, And knelt upon her knee, “Cheare up, cheare up, my gracious dame, I trust yet helpe may be: And here I will make mine avowe, And with the same me binde; That never will I return to thee, Till I some helpe may finde.” Then forth she rode on a faire palfràye Oer hill and dale about: But never a champion colde she finde, Wolde fighte with that knight so stout. And nowe the daye drewe on a pace, When our good queene must dye; All woe-begone was that faire damsèlle, When she found no helpe was nye. All woe-begone was that faire damsèlle, And the salt teares fell from her eye: When lo! as she rode by a rivers side, She met with a tinye boye. A tinye boye she mette, God wot, All clad in mantle of golde; He seemed noe more in mans likenèsse, Then a child of four yeere olde. Why grieve you, damselle faire, he sayd, And what doth cause you moane? The damsell scant wolde deigne a looke, But fast she pricked on. Yet turn againe, thou faïre damsèlle, And greete thy queene from mee: When bale is att hyest, boote is nyest, Now helpe enoughe may bee. Bid her remember what she dreamt In her bedd, wheras shee laye; How when the grype and the grimly beast Wolde have carried her crowne awaye, Even then there came the litle gray hawke, And saved her from his clawes: Then bidd the queene be merry at hart, For heaven will fende her cause. Back then rode that faire damsèlle, And her hart it lept for glee: And when she told her gracious dame A gladd womàn was shee. But when the appointed day was come, No helpe appeared nye: Then woeful, woeful was her hart, And the teares stood in her eye. And nowe a fyer was built of wood; And a stake was made of tree; And now queene Elinore forth was led, A sorrowful sight to see. Three times the herault he waved his hand, And three times spake on hye: Giff any good knight will fende this dame, Come forth, or shee must dye. No knight stood forth, no knight there came, No helpe appeared nye: And now the fyer was lighted up, Queen Elinore she must dye. And now the fyer was lighted up, As hot as hot might bee; When riding upon a little white steed, The tinye boy they see. “Away with that stake, away with those brands, And loose our comelye queene: I am come to fight with sir Aldingar, And prove him a traitor keene.” Forthe then stood sir Aldingar, But when he saw the chylde, He laughed, and scoffed, and turned his backe, And weened he had been beguylde. Now turne, now turne thee, Aldingar, And eyther fighte or flee; I trust that I shall avenge the wronge, Thoughe I am so small to see. The boye pulld forth a well good sworde So gilt it dazzled the ee; The first stroke stricken at Aldingar Smote off his leggs by the knee. Stand up, stand up, thou false traitòre, And fight upon thy feete, For and thou thrivest, as thou beginnest, Of height wee shal be meete. A priest, a priest, sayes Aldingàr, While I am a man alive. A priest, a priest, sayes Aldingàr, Me for to houzle and shrive. I wolde have layne by our comlye queene, Bot shee wolde never consent; Then I thought to betraye her unto our kinge In a fyer to have her brent. There came a lazar to the kings gates, A lazar both blinde and lame: I tooke the lazar upon my backe, And on her bedd him layne. Then ranne I to our comlye king, These tidings sore to tell. But ever alacke! sayes Aldingar, Falsing never doth well. Forgive, forgive me, queene, madame, The short time I must live. Nowe Christ forgive thee, Aldingar, As freely I forgive. Here take thy queene, our king Harry'e, And love her as thy life, For never had a king in Christentye, A truer and fairer wife. King Henrye ran to claspe his queene, And loosed her full sone: Then turnd to look for the tinye boye; —The boye was vanisht and gone. But first he had touchd the lazar man, And stroakt him with his hand: The lazar under the gallowes tree All whole and sounde did stand. The lazar under the gallowes tree Was comelye, straight and tall; King Henrye made him his head stewàrde To wayte withinn his hall. X. THE GABERLUNZIE MAN. A Scottish Song. Tradition assures us that the author of this song was K. James V. of Scotland. This prince (whose character for wit and libertinism bears a great resemblance to that of his gay successor Charles II.) was noted for strolling about his dominions in disguise sc. of a tinker, beggar, &amp;c. Thus be used to visit a smith's daughter at Niddry near Edinburgh., and for his frequent gallantries with country girls. Two adventures of this kind he hath celebrated with his own pen, viz. in this ballad of The Gaberlunzie Man; and in another intitled The Jolly Beggar, beginning thus, Thair was a jollie beggar, and a begging he was boun, And he tuik up his quarters into a land'art toun. Fa, la, la, &amp;c. It seems to be the latter of these ballads (which was too licentious to be admitted into this collection) that is meant in the Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors Vol. 2. p. 203., where the ingenious writer remarks, That there is something very ludicrous in the young woman's distress when she thought her first favour had been thrown away upon a beggar. Bp. Tanner has attributed to James V. the celebrated ballad of Christ's Kirk on the Green, which better authorities ascribe to his ancestor James I. and which has all the internal marks of being the production of an earlier age. See the Ever-green, Vol. I. As for K. James V. he died Dec. 13th, 1542, aged 33. The pauky auld Carle came ovir the lee Wi' mony good-eens and days to mee, Saying, Goodwife, for zour courtesie, Will ze lodge a silly poor man? The night was cauld, the carle was wat, And down azont the ingle he sat; My dochters shoulders he gan to clap, And cadgily ranted and sang. O wow! quo he, were I as free, As first when I saw this countrie, How blyth and merry wad I bee! And I wad nevir think lang. He grew canty, and she grew fain; But little did her auld minny ken What thir slee twa togither were say'n, When wooing they were sa thrang. And O! quo he, ann ze were as black, As evir the crown of your dadyes hat, Tis I wad lay thee by my back, And awa wi' me thou sould gang. And O! quoth she, ann I were as white, As evir the snaw lay on the dike, Ild clead me braw, and lady-like, And awa with thee Ild gang. Between the twa was made a plot; They raise a wee before the cock, And wyliely they shot the lock, And fast to the bent are they gane. Up the morn the auld wife raise, The Carline. Other copies. And at her leisure put on her claiths, Syne to the servants bed she gaes To speir for the silly poor man. She gaed to the bed, whair the beggar lay, The strae was cauld, he was away, She clapt her hands, cryd, dulefu' day! For some of our geir will be gane. Some ran to coffers, and some to kists, But nought was stown that could be mist, She dancid her lane, cryd, praise be blest, I have lodgd a leal poor man. Since naithings awa, as we can learn, The kirns to kirn, and milk to earn, Gae butt the house, lass, and waken my bairn, And bid her come quickly ben. The servant gaed where the dochter lay, The sheets was cauld, she was away, And fast to her goodwife can say, Shes aff with the gaberlunzie-man. O fy gar ride, and fy gar rin, And hast ze, find these traitors agen; For shees be burnt, and hees be slein. The wearyfou gaberlunzie man. Some rade upo horse, some ran a fit, The wife was wood, and out o'her wit; She could na gang, nor yet could she sit, But ay did curse and did ban. Mean time far hind out owre the lee, Fou snug in a glen, where nane could see, The twa, with kindlie sport and glee, Cut frae a new cheese a whang. The priving was gude, it pleas'd them baith, To lo'e her for ay, he gae her his aith. Quo she, to leave thee, I will be laith, My winsome gaberlunzie-man. O kend my minny I were wi' zou, Ill fardly wad she crook her mou, Sic a poor man sheld nevir trow, Aftir the gaberlunzie-mon. My dear, quo he, zee're zet owre zonge; And hae na learnt the beggars tonge, To follow me frae toun to toun, And carrie the gaberlunzie on. Wi' kauk and keel, Ill win zour bread, And spindles and whorles for them wha need, Whilk is a gentil trade indeed The gaberlunzie to carrie—o. Ill bow my leg and crook my knee, And draw a black clout owre my ee, A criple or blind they will cau mee: While we sall sing and be merrie—o. XI. ON THOMAS LORD CROMWELL. It is ever the fate of a disgraced minister to be forsaken by his friends, and insulted by his enemies, always reckoning among the latter the giddy inconstant multitude. We have here a spurn at fallen greatness from some angry partisan of declining popery, who could never forgive the downfall of their Diana, and loss of their craft. The ballad seems to have been composed between the time of Cromwell's commitment to the tower June 11. 1540, and that of his being beheaded July 28. following. A short interval! but Henry's passion for Catharine Howard would admit of no delay. Notwithstanding our libeller, Cromwell had many excellent qualities; his great fault was too much obsequiousness to the arbitrary will of his master; but let it be considered that this master had raised him from obscurity, and that the high-born nobility had shewn him the way in every kind of mean and servile compliance.—The original copy printed at London in 1540, is intitled, “A newe ballade made of Thomas Crumwel, called Trolle on away.” To it is prefixed this distich by way of burthen, Trolle on away, trolle on awaye. Synge heave and howe rombelowe trolle on away. Both man and chylde is glad to here tell Of that false traytoure Thomas Crumwel, Now that he is set to learne to spell. Synge trolle on away. When fortune lokyd the in thy face, Thou haddyst fayre tyme, but thou lackydyst grace; Thy cofers with golde thou fyllydst a pace. Synge, &amp;c. Both plate and chalys came to thy fyst, Thou lockydst them vp where no man wyst, Tyll in the kynges treasoure suche thinges were myst. Synge, &amp;c. Both crust and crumme came thorowe thy handes, Thy marchaundyse sayled over the sandes, Therfore nowe thou art layde fast in bandes. Synge, &amp;c. Fyrste when kynge Henry, God saue his grace! Perceyud myschefe kyndlyd in thy face, Then it was tyme to purchase the a place. Synge, &amp;c. Hys grace was euer of gentyll nature, Mouyd with petye, and made the hys seruyture; But thou, as a wretche, suche thinges dyd procure. Synge, &amp;c. Thou dyd not remembre, false heretyke, One God, one fayth, and one kynge catholyke, For thou hast bene so long a scysmatyke. Synge, &amp;c. Thou woldyst not learne to knowe these thre; But euer was full of iniquite: Wherfore all this lande hathe ben troubled with the. Synge, &amp;c. All they, that were of the new trycke, Agaynst the churche thou baddest them stycke; Wherfore nowe thou haste touchyd the quycke. Synge, &amp;c. Bothe sacramentes and sacramentalles Thou woldyst not suffre within thy walles; Nor let vs praye for all chrysten soules. Synge, &amp;c. Of what generacyon thou were no tonge can tell, Whyther of Chayme, or Syschemell, Or else sent vs frome the deuyll of hell. Synge, &amp;c. Thou woldest neuer to vertue applye, But couetyd euer to clymme to hye, And nowe haste thou trodden thy shoo awrye. Synge, &amp;c. Who-so-euer dyd winne thou wolde not lose; Wherfore al Englande doth hate the, as I suppose, Bycause thou wast false to the redolent rose. Synge, &amp;c. Thou myghtest haue learned thy cloth to flocke Upon thy gresy fullers stocke; Wherfore lay downe thy heade vpon this blocke. Synge, &amp;c. Yet saue that soule, that God hath bought, And for thy carcas care thou nought, Let it suffre payne, as it hath wrought. Synge, &amp;c. God saue kyng Henry with all his power, And prynce Edwarde that goodly flowre, With all hys lordes of great honoure. Synge trolle on awaye, syng trolle on away. Hevye and how rombelowe trolle on awaye. The foregoing Piece gave rise to a poetic controversy, which was carried on thro' a succession of seven or eight Ballads written for and against Lord Cromwell. These are all preserved in the archives of the Antiquarian Society, in a large folio Collection of Proclamations, &amp;c. made in the Reigns of K. Hen. VIII. K. Edw. VI. Q. Mary. Q. Eliz. K. James I. &amp;c. XII. HARPALUS. An ancient English Pastoral. This beautiful poem, which is perhaps the first attempt at pastoral writing in our language, is preserved among the Songs and Sonnettes of the earl of Surrey, &amp;c. 4 to. in that part of the collection, which consists of pieces by uncertain auctours. These poems were first published in 1557, ten years after that accomplished nobleman fell a victim to the tyranny of Henry VIII: but it is presumed most of them were composed before the death of sir Thomas Wyatt in 1541. See Surrey's poems, 4 to. fol. 19. 49. Tho' written perhaps near half a century before the Shepherd's calendar First published in 1579., this will be found far superior to any of those Eclogues in natural unaffected sentiments, in simplicity of style, in easy flow of versification, and all other beauties of pastoral poetry. Spenser ought to have profited more by so excellent a model. Phylida was a faire mayde, As fresh, as any flowre; Whom Harpalus the herdman prayde To be his paramour. Harpalus, and eke Corin, Were herdmen both yfere: And Phylida could twist and spinne, And thereto sing full clere. But Phylida was all tò coye, For Harpalus to winne: For Corin was her onely joye, Who forst her not a pinne. How often would she flowers twine? How often garlandes make Of couslips and of columbine? And al for Corin's sake. But Corin, he had haukes to lure, And forced more the field: Of lovers lawe he toke no cure; For once he was begilde. Harpalus prevailed nought, His labour all was lost; For he was fardest from her thought, And yet he loved her most. Therefore waxt he both pale and leane, And drye as clot of clay: His fleshe it was consumed cleane; His colour gone away. His beard it had not long be shave; His heare hong all unkempt: A man most fit even for the grave, Whom spitefull love had shent. His eyes were red, and all ‘forewacht’; The Corrections are from Ed. 1574. His face besprent with teares: It semde unhap had him long ‘hatcht’, In mids of his dispaires. His clothes were blacke, and also bare; As one forlorne was he; Upon his head alwayes he ware A wreath of wyllow tree. His beastes he kept upon the hyll, And he sate in the dale; And thus with sighes and sorowes shril, He gan to tell his tale. Oh Harpalus! thus would he say; Unhappiest under sunne! The cause of thine unhappy day, By love was first begunne. For thou wentest first by sute to seeke A tigre to make tame, That settes not by thy love a leeke; But makes thy griefe her game. As easy it were for to convert The frost into ‘a’ flame; As for to turne a frowarde hert, Whom thou so faine wouldst frame. Corin he liveth carèlesse: He leapes among the leaves: He eates the frutes of thy redresse: Thou ‘reapst’, he takes the sheaves. My beastes, a whyle your foode refraine, And harke your herdmans sounde: Whom spitefull love, alas! hath slaine, Through-girt with many a wounde. O happy be ye, beastès wilde, That here your pasture takes: I se that ye be not begilde Of these your faithfull makes. The hart he feedeth by the hinde: The bucke harde by the doe: The turtle dove is not unkinde To him that loves her so. The ewe she hath by her the ramme: The yong cowe hath the bulle: The calfe with many a lusty lambe Do fede their hunger full. But, wel-a-way! that nature wrought Thee, Phylida, so faire: For I may say that I have bought Thy beauty all tò deare. What reason is that crueltie With beautie should have part? Or els that such great tyranny Should dwell in womans hart? I see therefore to shape my death She cruelly is prest; To th'ende that I may want my breath: My dayes been at the best. O Cupide, graunt this my request, And do not stoppe thine eares; That she may feele within her brest The paines of my dispaires: Of Corin ‘who’ is carèlesse, That she may crave her fee: As I have done in great distresse, That loved her faithfully. But since that I shal die her slave; Her slave, and eke her thrall: Write you, my frendes, upon my grave This chaunce that is befall. “Here lieth unhappy Harpalus “By cruell love now slaine: “Whom Phylida unjustly thus, “Hath murdred with disdaine.” XIII. ROBIN AND MAKYNE. An ancient Scottish Pastoral. The palm of pastoral poesy is here contested by a cotemporary writer with the author of the foregoing. The reader will decide their respective merits. The author of this poem has one advantage over his rival, in having his name handed down to us. Mr. Robert Henryson (to whom we are indebted for it) appears to so much advantage among the writers of eclogue, that we are sorry we can give little other account of him, besides what is contained in the following eloge, written by W. Dunbar, a Scottish poet, who lived about the middle of the 16th century: “In Dumferling, he [Death] hath tane Broun, “With gude Mr. Robert Henryson.” Indeed some little farther insight into the history of this Scottish bard is gained from the title prefixed to some of his poems preserved in the British Museum; viz. “The morall Fabillis of Esop compylit be Maister Robert Henrisoun, scolmaister of Dumfermling, 1571.” Harleian MSS. 3865. § 1. In Ramsay's Evergreen, Vol. I. whence the above distich, and the following beautiful poem are extracted, are preserved two other little Doric pieces by Henryson; the one intitled The Lyon and the Mouse; the other, The garment of gude Ladyis. Robin sat on the gude grene hill, Keipand a flock of fie, Quhen mirry Makyne said him till, “O Robin rew on me “I haif thee luivt baith loud and still, “Thir towmonds twa or thre: “My dule in dern but gif thou dill, “Doubtless bot dreid Ill die. Robin replied, Now by the rude, Naithing of luve I knaw, But keip my sheip undir yon wod: Lo quhair they raik on raw. Quhat can have mart thee in thy mude, Thou Makyne to me schaw; Or quhat is luve, or to be lude? Fain wald I leir that law. “The law of luve gin thou wald leir, “Tak thair an A, B, C; “Be keynd, courtas, and fair of feir, “Wyse, hardy, ‘bauld’ and frie, kind and frie, MS. “Sae that nae danger do the deir, “What dule in dern thou drie; “Press ay to pleis, and blyth appeir, “Be patient and privie.” Robin, he answert her again, I wat not quhat is luve; But I half marvel uncertain Quhat makes thee thus wanruse. The wedder is fair, and I am fain; My sheep gais hail abuve; And we sould pley us on the plain, They wald us baith repruve. “Robin, tak tent unto my tale, “And wirk all as I reid; “And thou sall haif my heart all hale, “Eik and my maiden-heid: “Sen God, he sends ‘us’ bute for bale, “And for murning remeid, “I'dern with thee but give I dale, “Doubtless I am but deid.” Makyne, to-morn be this ilk tyde, Gif ye will meit me heir, Maybe my sheip may gang besyde, Quhyle we have liggd full neir; But maugre haif I, gif I byde, Frae thay begin to steir, Quhat lyes on heart I will nocht hyd, Then Makyne mak gude cheir. “Robin, thou reivs me of my rest; “I luve but thee alane.” Makyne, adieu! the sun goes west, The day is neir-hand gane. “Robin, in dule I am so drest, “That luve will be my bane.” Makyn, gae luve quhair-eir ye list, For lemans I luid nane. “Robin, I stand in sic a style, “I sich and that full fair.” Makyne, I have bene here this quyle; At hame I wish I were. “Robin, my hinny, talk and smyle, “Gif thou will do nae mair.” Makyne, som other man beguyle, For hameward I will fare. Syne Robin on his ways he went, As light as leif on tree; But Makyne murnt and made lament, Scho trow'd him neir to see. Robin he brayd attowre the bent: Then Makyne cried on hie, “Now may thou sing, for I am shent! “Quhat can ail luve at me?” Makyne went hame withouten fail, And weirylie could weip; Then Robin in a full fair dale Assemblit all his sheip: Be that some part of Makyne's ail, Out-throw his heart could creip, Hir fast he followt to assail, And till her tuke gude keip.

XIV. GENTLE HERDSMAN, TELL TO ME. Dialogue between a Pilgrim and Herdsman. The scene of this beautiful old ballad is laid near Walsingham in Norfolk, where was anciently an image of the Virgin Mary, famous over all Europe for the numerous pilgrimages made to it, and the great riches it possessed. Erasmus has given a very exact and humorous description of the superstitions practised there in his time. See his account of the Virgo parathalassia, in his colloquy, intitled, Peregrinatio religionis ergo. He tells us, the rich offerings in silver, gold, and precious stones, that were there shewn him, were incredible, there being scarce a person of any note in England, but what some time or other paid a visit, or sent a present to our lady of Walsingham See at the End of this Volume an account of the annual offerings of the Earls of Northumberland.. At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538, this splendid image, with another from Ipswich, was carried to Chelsea, and there burnt in the presence of commissioners; who, we trust, did not burn the jewels and the finery. This poem is printed from a copy in the Editor's folio MS. which had greatly suffered by the hand of time; but vestiges of several of the lines remaining, some conjectural supplements have been attempted, which, for greater exactness, are in this one ballad distinguished by Italicks. Gentle herdsman, tell to me, Of curtesy I thee pray, Unto the towne of Walsingham Which is the right and ready way. “Unto the towne of Walsingham “The way is hard for to be gone; “And verry crooked are those pathes “For you to find out all alone.” Were the miles doubled thrise, And the way never soe ill, Itt were not enough for mine offence; Itt is soe grievous and soe ill. “Thy yeares are young, thy face is faire, “Thy witts are weake, thy thoughts are greene; “Time hath not given thee leave, as yett, “For to committ so great a sinne.” Yes, herdsman, yes, soe woldst thou say, If thou knewest soe much as I; My witts, and thoughts, and all the rest, Have weil deserved for to dye. I am not what I seeme to bee, My clothes, and sexe doe differ farr: I am a woman, woe is me! Born to greeffe and irksome care. For my beloved, and well-beloved, My wayward cruelty could kill: And though my teares will nought avail, Most dearely I bewail him still. He was the flower of noble wights, None ever more sincere colde bee; Of comely mien and shape he was, And tenderlye hee loved mee. When thus I saw he loved me well, I grewe so proud his paine to see, That I, who did not know myselfe, Thought scorne of such a youth as hee. And grew soe coy and nice to please, As womens lookes are often soe, He might not kisse, nor hand forsooth, Uuless I willed him soe to doe. Thus being wearyed with delayes To see I pityed not his greeffe, He gott him to a secrett place, And there hee dyed without releeffe. And for his sake these weedes I weare, And sacriffice my tender age; And every day Ile begg my bread, To undergoe this pilgrimage. Thus every day I fast and praye, And ever will doe till I dye; And gett me to some secrett place, For soe did hee, and so will I. Now, gentle herdsman, aske no more, But keepe my secretts I thee pray; Unto the towne of Walsingham Show me the right and readye way. “Now goe thy wayes, and God before! “For he must ever guide thee still: “Turne downe that dale, the right hand path, “And soe, faire pilgrim, fare thee well!” XV. K. EDWARD IV. AND TANNER OF TAMWORTH Was a story of great fame among our ancestors. The author of the Art of English poesie, 1589, 4to, seems to speak of it, as a real fact.—Describing that vicious mode of speech, which the Greeks called Acyron, i. e. “When we use a dark and obscure word, utterly repugnant to that we should express;” he adds, “Such manner of uncouth speech did the Tanner of Tamworth use to king Edward the fourth; which Tanner, having a great while mistaken him, and used very broad talke with him, at length perceiving by his traine that it was the king, was afraide he should be punished for it, [and] said thus, with a certaine rude repentance, “I hope I shall be hanged to-morrow, for [I feare me] I shall be hanged; whereat the king laughed a good Vid. Gloss., not only to see the Tanner's vaine feare, but also to heare his illshapen terme; and gave him for recompence of his good sport, the inheritance of Plumpton-parke. I am afraid,” concludes this sagacious writer, “the poets of our time, that speake more finely and correctedly, will come too short of such a reward,” p. 214.—The phrase, here referred to, is not found in this ballad at present, but occurs with some variation in an older poem, intitled John the Reeve, described in the following volume, (see the Preface to the King and the Miller), viz. “Nay, sayd John, by Gods grace, “And Edward wer in this place, “Hee shold not touch this tonne: “He wold be wroth with John I hope, “Thereffore I beshrew the soupe, “That in his mouth shold come.” Pt. 2. st. 24. The following text is selected from two copies in black letter. The one in the Bodleyan library, intitled, “A merrie, pleasant, and delectable historie betweene K. Edward the Fourth, and a Tanner of Tamworth, &amp;c. printed at London, by John Danter, 1596.” This copy, ancient as it now is, appears to have been modernized and altered at the time it was published; but many vestiges of the more ancient readings were recovered from another copy, (though more recently printed,) in one sheet folio, without date, in the Pepys collection. In summer time, when leaves grow greene, And blossoms bedecke the tree, King Edward wolde a hunting ryde, Some pastime for to see. With hawke and hounde he made him bowne, With horne, and eke with bowe; To Drayton Basset he tooke his waye, With all his lordes a rowe. And he had ridden ore dale and downe By eight of clocke in the day, When he was ware of a bold tannèr Come ryding along the waye. A fayre russet coat the tanner had on Fast buttoned under his chin, And under him a good cow-hide, And a mare of four shilling In the reign of Edward IV. Dame Cecill, lady of Torboke, in her will dated March 7. A. D. 1466; among many other bequests has this, “Also I will that my sonne Thomas of Torboke have 13 s. 4 d. to buy him an horse.” Vid Harleian Catalog. 2176. 27.—Now if 13 s. 4 d. would purchase a steed fit for a person of quality, a tanner's horse might reasonably be valued at four or five shillings.. Nowe stand you still, my good lordes all, Under the grene wood spraye; And I will wend to yonder fellowe, To weet what he will saye. God speede, God speede thee, said our king. Thou art welcome, sir, sayd hee. “The readyest waye to Drayton Basset I praye thee to shewe to mee.” “To Drayton Basset woldst thou goe, Fro the place where thou dost stand? The next payre of gallowes thou comest unto, Turne in upon thy right hand.” That is an unreadye waye, sayd our king, Thou doest but jest I see: Nowe shewe me out the nearest waye, And I pray thee wend with mee. Awaye with a vengeance! quoth the tanner: I hold thee out of thy witt: All daye have I rydden on Brocke my mare, And I am fasting yett. “Go with me downe to Drayton Basset, No daynties we will spare; All daye shalt thou eate and drinke of the best, And I will paye thy fare.” Gramercye for nothing, the tanner replyde, Thou payest no fare of mine: I trowe I've more nobles in my purse, Than thou hast pence in thine. God give thee joy of them, sayd the king, And send them well to priefe. The tanner wolde faine have beene away, For he weende he had beene a thiefe. What art thou, hee sayde, thou fine fellòwe, Of thee I am in great feare, For the cloathes, thou wearest upon thy backe, Might beseeme a lord to weare. I never stole them, quoth our king, I tell you, sir, by the roode. “Then thou playest, as many an unthrift doth, And standest in midds of thy goode.” What tydinges heare you, sayd the kynge, As you ryde farre and neare? “I heare no tydinges, sir, by the masse, But that cowe-hides are deare.” “Cowe-hides! cowe-hides! what things are those? I marvell what they bee?” What art thou a foole? the tanner reply'd; I carry one under mee.” What craftsman art thou, said the king, I praye thee tell me trowe. “I am a barker, sir, by my trade; Nowe tell me what art thou?” I am a poore courtier, sir, quoth he, That am forth of service worne; And faine I wolde thy prentise bee, Thy cunninge for to learne. Marrye heaven forfend, the tanner replyde, That thou my prentise were: Thou woldst spend more good than I shold winne By fortye shilling a yere. Yet one thinge wolde I, sayd our king, If thou wilt not seeme strange: Thoughe my horse be better than thy mare, Yet with thee I faine wold change. “Why if with me thou faine wilt change, As change full well maye wee, By the faith of my bodye, thou proude fellòwe, I will have some boot of thee.” That were against reason, sayd the king, I sweare, so mote I thee: My horse is better than thy mare, And that thou well mayst see. “Yea, sir, but Brocke is gentle and mild, And softly she will fare: Thy horse is unrulye and wild, I wiss; Aye skipping here and theare.” What boote wilt thou have? our king reply'd; Now tell me in this stound. “Noe pence, nor half pence, by my faye, But a noble in gold so round.” “Here's twentye groates of white moneyè, Sith thou will have it of mee.” I would have sworne now, quoth the tanner, Thou hadst not had one penniè. But since we two have made a change, A change we must abide, Although thou hast gotten Brocke my mare, Thou gettest not my cowe-hide. I will not have it, sayd the kynge, I sweare, so mote I thee; Thy foule cowe-hide I wolde not beare, If thou woldst give it to mee. The tanner hee tooke his good cowe-hide, That of the cow was hilt; And threwe it upon the king's sadèlle, That was soe fayrelye gilte. “Now help me up, thou fine fellòwe, 'Tis time that I were gone: When I come home to Gyllian, my wife, Sheel say I am a gentilmon.” The king he tooke him up by the legge; The tanner a f? lett fall. Nowe marrye, good fellowe, sayd the kyng, Thy courtesye is but small. When the tanner he was in the kinges sadèlle, And his foote in the stirrup was; He marvelled greatlye in his minde, Whether it were golde or brass. But when his steede saw the cows taile wagge, And eke the blacke cowe-horne; He stamped, and stared, and awaye he ranne, As the devill had him borne. The tanner he pulld, the tanner he sweat, And held by the pummil fast: At length the tanner came tumbling downe; His necke he had well-nye brast. Take thy horse again with avengeance, he sayd, With mee he shall not byde. “My horse wolde have borne thee well enoughe, But he knewe not of thy cowe-hide. Yet if againe thou faine woldst change, As change full well may wee, By the faith of my bodye, thou jolly tannèr, I will have some boote of thee.” What boote wilt thou have, the tanner replyd, Nowe tell me in this stounde? “Noe pence nor halfpence, sir, by my faye, But I will have twentye pound.” “Here's twentye groates out of my purse; And twentye I have of thine: And I have one more, which we will spend Together at the wine.” The king set a bugle horne to his mouthe, And blewe both loude and shrille: And soone came lords, and soone came knights, Fast ryding over the hille. Nowe, out alas! the tanner he cryde, That ever I sawe this daye! Thou art a strong thiefe, yon come thy fellowes Will beare my cowe-hide away. They are no thieves, the king replyde, I sweare, soe mote I thee: But they are the lords of the north countrèy, Here come to hunt with mee. And soone before our king they came, And knelt downe on the grounde: Then might the tanner have beene awaye, He had lever than twentye pounde. A coller, a coller A collar was, I believe, anciently used in the ceremony of conferring knighthood. Or perhaps the King used the French word Acoller, signifying to give the Acolade, or blow that was to dub him a knight. This the Tanner ignorantly mistakes for A collar., here: sayd the king, A coller he loud did crye: Then woulde he lever then twentye pound, He had not beene so nighe. A coller, a coller, the tanner he sayd, I trowe it will breed sorrowe: After a coller comes a halter, And I shall be hanged to-morrowe. “Awaye with thy feare, thou jolly tannèr, For the sport thou hast shewn to me, I wote noe halter thou shalt weare, But thou shalt have a knight's fee. For Plumpton-parke I will give thee, With tenements faire beside: 'Tis worth three hundred markes by the yeare, To maintaine thy good cowe-hide.” Gramercye, my liege, the tanner replyde, For the favour thou hast me showne; If ever thou comest to merry Tamwòrth, Neates leather shall clout thy shoen. XVI. AS YE CAME FROM THE HOLY LAND. Dialogue between a Pilgrim and Traveller. The scene of this song is the same, as in num. XIV. The pilgrimage to Walsingham suggested the plan of many popular pieces. In the Pepys collection, Vol. I. p. 226, is a kind of Interlude in the old ballad style, of which the first stanza alone is worth reprinting, As I went to Walsingham, To the shrine with speede, Met I with a jolly palmer In a pilgrimes weede. Now God you save, you jolly palmer! “Welcome, lady gay, “Oft have I sued to thee for love.” —Oft have I said you nay. The pilgrimages undertaken on pretence of religion, were often productive of affairs of gallantry, and led the votaries to no other shrine than that of Venus Even in the time of Langland, pilgrimages to Walsingham were not unfavourable to the rites of Venus. Thus in his Visions of Pierce Plowman, fo. 1. Hermets on a heape, with hoked staves, Wenten to Walsingham, and her i. e. their. wenches after.. The following ballad was once very popular; it is quoted in Fletcher's “Knt. of the burning pestle,” Act 2. sc. ult. and in another old play, called, “Hans Beer-pot, his invisible Comedy, &amp;c.” 4to, 1618; Act I.—The copy below was communicated to the Editor by the late Mr. Shenstone as corrected by him from an ancient MS, and supplied with a concluding stanza. We have placed this, and Gentle Herdsman, &amp;c. thus early in the volume, upon a presumption that they must have been written, if not before the dissolution of the monasteries, yet while the remembrance of them was fresh in the minds of the people. As ye came from the holy land Of ‘blessed’ Walsingham, O met you not with my true love As by the way ye came? “How should I know your true love, “That have met many a one, “As I came from the holy land, “That have both come, and gone?” My love is neither white sc. pale., nor browne, But as the heavens faire; There is none hath her form divine, Either in earth, or ayre. “Such an one did I meet, good sir, “With an angelicke face; “Who like a nymphe, a queene appeard “Both in her gait, her grace.” Yes: she hath cleane forsaken me, And left me all alone; Who some time loved me as her life, And called me her owne. “What is the cause she leaves thee thus, “And a new way doth take, “That some time loved thee as her life, “And thee her joy did make?” I that loved her all my youth, Growe old now as you see; Love liketh not the falling fruite, Nor yet the withered tree. For love is like a carelesse childe, Forgetting promise past: He is blind, or deaf, whenere he list; His faith is never fast. His ‘fond’ desire is fickle found, And yieldes a trustlesse joye; Wonne with a world of toil and care, And lost ev'n with a toye. Such is the love of womankinde, Or Loves faire name abusde, Beneathe which many vaine desires, And follyes are excusde. ‘But true love is a lasting fire, ‘Which viewless vestals sc. Angels. tend, ‘That burnes for ever in the soule, ‘And knowes nor change, nor end.’ XVII. HARDYKNUTE. A Scottish Fragment. The attribution of this poem is questionable. As this fine morsel of heroic poetry hath generally past for ancient, it is here thrown to the end of our earliest pieces; that such as doubt of its age, may the better compare it with other pieces of genuine antiquity. For after all, there is more than reason to suspect, that most of its beauties are of modern date; and that these at least (if not its whole existence) have flowed from the pen of a lady, within this present century. The following particulars may be depended on. One Mrs. Wardlaw, whose maiden name was Halket (aunt to the late Sir Peter Halket of Pitferran in Scotland, who was killed in America along with general Bradock in 1755) pretended she had found this poem, written on shreds of paper, employed for what is called the bottoms of clues. A suspicion arose that it was her own composition. Some able judges asserted it to be modern. The lady did in a manner acknowledge it to be so. Being desired to shew an additional stanza, as a proof of this, she produced the three last beginning with “Loud and schrill,” &amp;c. which were not in the copy that was first printed, The late Lord President Forbes, and Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto (late Lord Justice Clerk for Scotland) who had believed it ancient, contributed to the expence of publishing the first Edition, which came out in folio about the year 1720.—This account is transmitted from Scotland by a gentleman of distinguished rank, learning, and genius, who yet is of opinion, that part of the ballad may be ancient; but retouched and much enlarged by the lady abovementioned. Indeed he hath been informed, that the late William Thompson, the Scottish musician, who published the Orpheus Caledonius, 1733, 2 vols. 8vo. declared he had heard fragments of it repeated during his infancy; before ever Mrs. Wardlaw's copy was heard of. Stately stept he east the wa, And stately stept he west, Full seventy zeirs he now had sene, With skerss sevin zeirsof rest. He livit quhen Britons breach of faith Wroucht Scotland meikle wae: And ay his sword tauld to their cost, He was their deidly fae. Hie on a hill his castle stude, With halls and touris a hicht, And guidly chambers fair to se, Quhair he lodgit mony a knicht. His dame sae peirless anes and fair, For chast and bewtie deimt, Nae marrow had in all the land, Saif Elenor the quene. Full thirtein sons to him scho bare, All men of valour stout; In bluidy ficht with sword in hand Nyne lost their lives bot doubt: Four zit remain, lang may they live To stand by liege and land; Hie was their fame, hie was their micht, And hie was their command. Great luve they bare to Fairly fair, Their sister fast and deir, Her girdle shawd her midle gimp, And gowden glist her hair. Quhat waefou wae her bewtie bred? Waefou to zung and auld, Waufou I trow to kyth and kyn, As story ever tauld. The king of Norse in summer tyde, Puft up with powir and micht, Landed in fair Scotland the yle, With mony a hardy knicht. The tydings to our gude Scots king Came, as he sat at dyne, With noble chiefs in braif aray, Drinking the blude-reid wine. “To horse, to horse, my ryal liege, Zours faes stand on the strand, Full twenty thousand glittering spears The king of Norse commands.” Bring me my steed Mage dapple gray, Our gude king raise and cryd, A trustier beast in all the land A Scots king nevir seyd. Go little page, tell Hardyknute, That lives on hill so hie, To draw his sword, the dreid of faes, And haste and follow me. The little page flew swift as dart Flung by his masters arm, “Cum down, cum down, lord Hardyknute, And rid zour king frae harm.” Then reid reid grew his dark-brown cheiks, Sae did his dark-brown brow; His luiks grew kene, as they were wont In dangers great to do; He hes tane a horn as green as glass, And gien five sounds sae shrill, That treis in grene wood schuke thereat, Sae loud rang ilka hill. His sons in manly sport and glie, Had past that summers morn, Quhen low down in a grassy dale, They heard their fatheris horn. That horn, quod they, neir sounds in peace, We haif other sport to byde. And sune they heyd them up the hill, And sune were at his syde. “Late late the zestrene I weind in peace To end my lengthned life, My age micht weil excuse my arm Frae manly feats of stryfe; But now that Norse dois proudly boast Fair Scotland to inthrall, Its neir be said of Hardyknute, He feard to ficht or fall. “Robin of Rothsay, bend thy bow, Thy arrows schute sae leil, That mony a comely countenance They haif turnd to deidly pale. Brade Thomas tak ze but zour lance, Ze neid nae weapons mair, Gif ze ficht we' it as ze did anes Gainst Westmorlands ferss heir. “And Malcom, licht of fute as stag That runs in forest wyld, Get me my thousands thrie of men Well bred to sword and schield: Bring me my horse and harnisine My blade of mettal cleir. If faes kend but the hand it bare, They sune had fled for feir. “Fareweil my dame sae peirless gude, (And tuke her by the hand), Fairer to me in age zou seim, Than maids for bewtie famd: My zoungest son shall here remain To guard these stately towirs, And shut the silver bolt that keips Sae fast zour painted bowirs.” And first scho wet her comely cheiks, And then her boddice grene, Hir silken cords of twirtle twist, Weil plett with silver schene; And apron sett with mony a dice Of neidle-wark sae rare, Wove by nae hand, as ze may guess, Saif that of Fairly fair. And he has ridden owre muir and moss, Owre hills and mony a glen, Quhen he came to a wounded knicht Making a heavy mane; “Here maun I lye, here maun I dye, By treacheries false gyles; Witless I was that eir gaif faith To wicked womans smyles.” “Sir knicht, gin ze were in my bowir, To lean on silken seat, My laydis kyndlie care zoud prove, Quha neir kend deidly hate: Hir self wald watch ze all the day, Hir maids a deid of nicht; And Fairly fair zour heart wald cheir, As scho stands in zour sicht. “Aryse young knicht, and mount zour steid, Full lowns the shynand day: Cheis frae my menzie quhom ze pleis To leid ze on the way.” With smyless luke, and visage wan The wounded knicht replyd, “Kynd chiftain, zour intent pursue, For heir I maun abyde. To me nae after day nor nicht Can eir be sweit or fair, But sune beneath sum draping tree, Cauld death shall end my care.” With him nae pleiding micht prevail; Brave Hardyknute in to gain, With fairest words and reason strong, Strave courteously in vain. Syne he has gane far hynd attowre Lord Chattans land sae wyde; That lord a worthy wicht was ay, Quhen faes his courage seyd: Of Pictish race by mothers syde, Quhen Picts ruld Caledon, Lord Chattan claimd the princely maid, Quhen he saift Pictish crown. Now with his ferss and stalwart train, He reicht a rysing heicht, Quhair braid encampit on the dale, Norss menzie lay in sicht. “Zonder my valiant sons and ferss, Our raging revers wait On the unconquerit Scottish swaird To try with us their fate. Make orisons to him that saift Our sauls upon the rude; Syne braifly schaw zour veins ar filld With Caledonian blude.” Then furth he drew his trusty glaive, Quhyle thousands all around Drawn frae their sheaths glanst in the sun, And loud the bougills sound. To join his king adoun the hill In hast his merch he made, Quhyle, play and pibrochs, minstralls meit Afore him statly strade. “Thryse welcum valziant stoup of weir, Thy nations scheild and pryde; Thy king nae reason has to feir Quhen thou art be his syde.” Then bows were bent and darts were thrawn; For thrang scarce could they flie; The darts clove arrows as they met, The arrows dart the trie. Lang did they rage and ficht full ferss, With little skaith to man, But bludy bludy was the field, Or that lang day was done. The king of Scots, that sindle bruikd The war that luikt lyke play, Drew his braid sword, and brake his bow, Sen bows seimt but delay. Quoth noble Rothsay, “Myne i'll keip, I wate its bleid a skore.” Hast up my merry men, cryd the king, As he rade on before. The king of Norse he socht to find, With him to mense the faucht, But on his forehead there did licht A sharp unsonsie shaft; As he his hand put up to find The wound, an arrow kene, O waefou chance! there pinnd his hand In midst betweene his ene. “Revenge, revenge, cryd Rothsays heir, Your mail-coat sall nocht byde The strength and sharpness of my dart:” Then sent it thruch his syde. Another arrow weil he markd, It persit his neck in twa, His hands then quat the silver reins, He law as eard did fa. “Sair bleids my liege, sair, sair he bleids!” Again with micht he drew And gesture dreid his sturdy bow, Fast the braid arrow flew: Wae to the knicht he ettled at; Lament now quene Elgreid; Hie dames to wail zour darlings fall, His zouth and comely meid. “Take aff, take aff his costly jupe (Of gold weil was it twynd, Knit lyke the fowlers net, throuch quhilk His steilly harness shynd) Take, Norse, that gift frae me, and bid Him venge the blude it beirs; Say, if he face my bended bow, He sure nae weapon feirs.” Proud Norse with giant body tall, Braid shoulder and arms strong, Cry'd, “Quhair is Hardyknute sae famd, And feird at Britains throne: Thah Britons tremble at his name, I sune sall make him wail, That eir my sword was made sae sharp, Sae saft his coat of mail.” That brag his stout heart could na byde, It lent him zouthfou micht: “I'm Hardyknute; this day, he cry'd, To Scotland's king I hecht To lay thee law, as horses hufe; My word I mean to keip.” Syne with the first strakeeir he strake, He garrd his body bleid. Norse ene lyke gray gosehawke staird wyld, He sicht with shame and spyte; “Disgrac'd is now my far-fam'd arm That left thee power to stryke:” Then gaif his head a blaw sae fell, It made him doun to stoup, As law as he to ladies usit In courtly gyse to lout. Full sune he raisd his bent body, His bow he marvelld sair, Sen blaws till then on him but darrd As touch of Fairly fair: Norse ferliet too as sair as he To se his stately luke; Sae sune as eir he strake a fae, Sae sune his lyfe he tuke. Quhair lyke a fyre to hether set, Bauld Thomas did advance, A sturdy fae with luke enrag'd Up towards him did prance; He spurd his steid throw thickest ranks The hardy zouth to quell, Quha stude unmufit at his approach His furie to repell. “That schort brown shaft sae meanly trim'd, Lukis lyke poor Scotlands geir, But dreidfull seems the rusty point!” And loud he leuch in jeir. “Aft Britons blude has dimd its shyne; This poynt cut short their vaunt:” Syne pierc'd the boisteris bairded cheik; Nae tyme he tuke to taunt. Schort quhyle he in his sadill swang, His stirrup was nae stay, Sae feible hang his unbent knee Sure taken he was fey: Swith on the hardened clay he fell, Richt far was heard the thud: But Thomas luikt not as he lay All waltering in his blude. With cairles gesture, mynd unmuvit, On raid he north the plain; His seim in thrang of fiercest stryfe, Quhen winner ay the same: Nor zit his heart dames dimpelit cheik Could meise saft love to bruik, Till vengeful Ann returnd his scorn, Then languid grew his luke. In thrawis of death, with wallowit cheik All panting on the plain, The fainting corps of warriours lay, Neir to aryse again; Neir to return to native land, Nae mair with blythsom sounds To boist the glories of the day, And schaw their shining wounds. On Norways coast the widowit dame May wash the rocks with teirs, May lang luke owre the schiples seis Befoir hir mate appears. Ceife, Emma, ceise to hope in vain; Thy lord lyis in the clay; The valziant Scots nae revers thole To carry lyfe away. There on a lie, quhair stands a cross Set up for monument, Thousands full fierce that summers day Filld kene waris black intent. Let Scots, quhyle Scots, praise Hardyknute, Let Norse the name ay dreid, Ay how he faucht, aft how he spaird, Sal latest ages reid. Loud and chill blew the westlin wind, Sair beat the heavy showir, Mirk grew the nicht eir Hardyknute Wan neir his stately towir. His towir that usd with torches bleise To shyne sae far at nicht, Seimd now as black as mourning weid, Nae marvel sair he sichd. “Thairs nae licht in my ladys bowir, Thairs nae licht in my hall; Nae blink shynes round my Fairly fair, Nor ward stands on my wall. “Quhat bodes it? Robert, Thomas, say;”— Nae answer fits their dreid. “Stand back, my sons, I'll be zour gyde:” But by they past with speid. “As fast I haif sped owre Scotlands faes,”— There ceist his brag of weir, Sair schamit to mynd ocht but his dame, And maiden Fairly fair. Black feir he felt, but quhat to feir He wist not zit with dreid; Sair schuke his body, sair his limbs, And all the warrior fled. Since this poem of Hardyknute was first printed off, still farther information has been received concerning the original manner of its publication, and the additions made to it afterwards. “The late Dr. John Clerk, a celebrated physician in Edinburgh, one of Lord President Forbes's intimate companions, has left in his own hand writing, an ample account of all the additions and variations made in this celebrated poem, as also two additional stanzas never yet printed.” The title of the first edition was, “Hardyknute, a Fragment. Edinburgh. 1719.” folio. 12 pages. Stanzas not in the first edition, but added afterwards in the Evergreen, 1724, 120. are the two, beginning at ver. 129. “Aryse young knicht, &amp;c. to ver. 144.—Instead of ver. 143, 144, as they stand at present, Dr. Clerk's MS. has With argument, but vainly strave Lang courteously in vain. Again, from ver. 153. Now with his ferss, &amp;c. to 176, are not in the first edit.—In Dr. Clerk's MS. ver. 170, &amp;c. runs thus, In haste his strides he bent While minstrells play and pibrocks fine Afore him stately went. Lastly, from ver. 257. Quhair lyke a fyre, &amp;c. to the end of the poem, were not in the 1st copy. Variation of line the last (v. 336.) is “He feared a' could be feared.” The two additional stanzas come in between ver. 388. and v. 389. and are these, Now darts flew wavering through slaw speed, Scarce could they reach their aim; Or reach'd, scarce blood the round point drew, 'Twas all but shot in vain: Right strengthy arms forfeebled grew, Sair wreck'd wi' that day's toils; E'en fierce-born minds now lang'd for peace, And curs'd war's cruel broils. Yet still wars horns sounded to charge, Swords clash'd and harness rang; But saftly sae ilk blaster blew The hills and dales fraemang. Nae echo heard in double dints, Nor the lang-winding horn, Nae mair she blew out brade as she Did eir that summers morn. This obliging information the Reader owes to David Clerk, M. D. at Edinburgh, son of Dr. John Clerk. It is perhaps needless to observe, that these two stanzas, as well as most of the variations above, are of inferior merit to the rest of the poem, and are probably first sketches that were afterwards rejected. THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. I. A BALLAD OF LUTHER, THE POPE, A CARDINAL, AND A HUSBANDMAN. In the former Book we brought down this second Series of poems, as low as about the middle of the sixteenth century. We now find the Muses deeply engaged in religious controversy. The sudden revolution, wrought in the opinions of mankind by the Reformation, is one of the most striking events in the history of the human mind. It could not but engross the attention of every individual in that age, and therefore no other writings would have any chance to be read, but such as related to this grand topic. The alterations made in the established religion by Henry VIII, the sudden changes it underwent in the three succeeding reigns within so short a space as eleven or twelve years, and the violent struggles between expiring Popery, and growing Protestantism, could not but interest all mankind. Accordingly every pen was engaged in the dispute. The followers of the Old and New Profession (as they were called) had their respective Ballad-makers; and every day produced some popular sonnet for, or against the Reformation. The following ballad, and that intitled little john nobody, may serve for specimens of the writings of each party. Both were written in the reign of Edward VI; and are not the worst that were composed upon the occasion. Controversial divinity is no friend to poetic flights. Yet this ballad of “Luther and the Pope,” is not altogether devoid of spirit; it is of the dramatic kind, and the characters are tolerably well sustained; especially that of Luther, which is made to speak in a manner not unbecoming the spirit and courage of that vigorous Reformer. It is printed from the original black-letter copy (in the Pepys collection, vol. I. folio,) to which is prefixed a large wooden cut, designed and executed by some eminent master. This is copied in miniature in the small Engraving inserted above. We are not to wonder that the Ballad-writers of that age should be inspired with the zeal of controversy, when the very stage teemed with polemic divinity. I have now before me two very ancient quarto black-letter plays: the one published in the time of Henry VIII, intitled, Every Man; the other called Lusty Iuventus, printed in the reign of Edward VI. In the former of these, occasion is taken to inculcate great reverence for old mother church and her superstitions Take a specimen from his high encomiums on the priesthood, “There is no emperour, kyng, duke, ne baron “That of God hath commissyon, “As hath the leest preest in the world beynge. “God hath to them more power gyven, “Than to any aungeil, that is in heven: “With v. words he may consecrate “Goddes body in fleshe and blode to take, “And handeleth his maker bytwene his bandes. “The preest byndeth and unbindeth all bandes, “Bothe in erthe and in heven. “Thou ministers all the sacramentes seven. “Though we kyst thy fete thou were worthy; “Thou art the surgyan that cureth synne dedly; “No remedy may we fynde under God, “But alone on preesthode. “Every-man, God gave preest that dignitè, “And letteth them in his stede amonge us be, “Thus be they above aungels in degre.” sign. C. j. b.: in the other, the poet (one R. Wever) with great success attacks both. So that the Stage in those days literally was, what wise men have always wished it,—a supplement to the pulpit:—This was so much the case, that in the play of Lusty Juventus, chapter and verse are every where quoted as formally, as in a sermon; take an instance, “The Lord by his prophet Ezechiel sayeth in this wise playnlye, “As in the xxxiij chapter it doth appere: “Be converted, O ye children, &amp;c.” From this play we learn that most of the young people were New Gospellers, or friends to the Reformation; and that the old were tenacious of the doctrines imbibed in their youth: for thus the Devil is introduced lamenting the downfal of superstition, “The olde people would believe stil in my lawes, “But the yonger sort leade them a contrary way, “They wyl not beleve, they playnly say, “In olde traditions, and made by men, &amp;c.” And in another place Hypocrisy urges, “The worlde was never meri “Since chyldren were so boulde: “Now every boy wil be a teacher, “The father a foole, the chyld a preacher.” Of the plays abovementioned, to the first is subjoined the following Printer's Colophon, Thus endeth this moral playe of Every Man. Imprynted at London in Powles chyrche yarde by me John Skor. ?. In Mr. Garrick's collection is an imperfect copy of the same play, printed by Richarde Pynson. The other is intitled, An enterlude called Lusty Iuventus: and is thus distinguished at the end: Finis. quod R. Weber. Imprinted at London in Paules churche yeard, by Abraham Dele at the signe of the Lambe. Of this too Mr. Garrick has an imperfect copy of a different edition. Of these two Plays the Reader may find some farther particulars in the former Volume, Book II. see The Essay on the Origin of the English Stage. The Husbandman. Let us lift up our hartes all, And prayse the lordes magnificence, Which hath given the wolues a fall, And is become our strong defence: For they thorowe a false pretens From Christes bloude dyd all us leade, Gettynge from every man his pence, As satisfactours for the deade. For what we with our flayles coulde get To kepe our house, and servauntes; That did the Freers from us set, And with our soules played the marchauntes: And thus they with theyr false warrantes Of our sweate have easelye lyved, That for fatnesse theyr belyes pantes, So greatlye have they us deceaued. They spared not the fatherlesse, The carefull, nor the pore wydowe; They wolde have somewhat more or lesse, If it above the ground did growe: But now we husbandmen do knowe Al their subteltye, and their false caste; For the lorde hath them overthrowe With his swete word now at the laste. Doctor Martin Luther. Thou antichrist, with thy thre crownes, Hast usurped kynges powers, As having power over realmes and townes, Whom thou oughtest to serve all houres: Thou thinkest by thy jugglyng colours Thou maist lykewise Gods word oppresse; As do the deceatful foulers, When they theyr nettes craftelye dresse. Thou flatterest every prince, and lord, Thretening poore men with swearde and fyre; All those, that do followe Gods worde, To make them cleve to thy desire, Theyr bokes thou burnest in flaming fire; Cursing with boke, bell, and candell, Such as to reade them have desyre, Or with them are wyllynge to meddell. Thy false power wyl I bryng down. Thou shalt not raygne many a yere, I shall dryve the from citye and towne, Even with this pen that thou seyste here: Thou fyghtest with swerd, shylde, and speare, But I wyll fyght with Gods worde; Which is now so open and cleare, That it shall brynge the under the borde. The Pope. Though I brought never so many to hel, And to utter dampnacion, Throughe myne ensample, and consel, Or thorow any abhominacion, Yet doth our lawe excuse my fashion. And thou, Luther, arte accursed; For blamynge me, and my condicion, The holy decres have the condempned. Thou stryvest against my purgatory, Because thou findest it not in scripture; As though I by myne auctorite Myght not make one for myne honoure. Knowest thou not, that I have power To make, and mar, in heaven and hell, In erth, and every creature? Whatsoever I do it must be well. As for scripture, I am above it; Am not I Gods hye vicare? Shulde I be bounde to folowe it, As the carpenter his ruler? Nay, nay, heretickes ye are, That will not obey my auctoritie. With this sworde I wyll declare, That ye shal al accursed be. The Cardinal. I am a cardinall of Rome, Sent from Christes hye vicary, To graunt pardon to more, and sume, That wil Luther resist strongly: He is a greate hereticke treuly, And regardeth to much the scripture; For he thinketh onely thereby To subdue the popes high honoure. Receive ye this pardon devoutely, And loke that ye agaynst him fight; Plucke up youre herts, and be manlye, For the pope sayth ye do but ryght: And this be sure, that at one flyghte, Allthough ye be overcome by chaunce, Ye shall to heaven go with greate myghte; God can make you no resistaunce. But these heretikes for their medlynge Shall go down to hel every one; For they have not the popes blessynge, Nor regarde his holy pardòn: They thinke from all destruction By Christes bloud, to be saved, Fearynge not our excommunicacion, Therefore shall they al be dampned. II. JOHN ANDERSON MY JO. A Scottish Song. While in England verse was made the vehicle of controversy, and Popery was attacked in it by logical argument, or stinging satire; we may be sure the zeal of the Scottish Reformers would not suffer their pens to be idle, but many a pasquil was discharged at the Romish priests, and their enormous encroachments on property. Of this kind perhaps is the following, (preserved in an ancient MS. Collection of Scottish poems in the Pepysian library:) Tak a Wobster, that is leill, And a Miller, that will not steill, With ane Priest, that is not gredy, And lay ane deid corpse thame by, And, throw virtue of thame three, That deid corpse sall qwyknit be. Thus far all was fair: but the furious hatred of popery led them to employ their rhymes in a still more licentious manner. It is a received tradition in Scotland, that at the time of the Reformation, ridiculous and baudy songs were composed to be sung by the rabble to the tunes of the most favourite hymns in the Latin service Greene sleeves and pudding pies (designed to ridicule the popish clergy) is said to have been one of these metamorphosed hymns: Maggy Lauder was another: John Anderson my jo was a third. The original music of all these burlesque sonnets was very fine. To give a specimen of their manner, we have inserted one of the least offensive. The Reader will pardon the meanness of the composition for the sake of the anecdote, which strongly marks the spirit of the times. The adaptation of solemn church music to these ludicrous pieces, and the jumble of ideas, thereby occasioned, will account for the following fact.—From the Records of the General Assembly in Scotland, called, “The Book of the Universal Kirk,” p. 90. 7th July, 1568, it appears, that Thomas Bassendyne printer in Edinburgh, printed “a psalme buik, in the end whereof was found printit ane baudy sang, called, “Welcome Fortunes See also Biograph. Britan. vol. I. p. 177..” Woman. John Anderson my jo, cum in as ze gae bye, And ze sall get a sheips heid weel baken in a pye; Weel baken in a pye, and the haggis in a pat: John Anderson my jo, cum in, and ze's get that. Man. And how doe ze, Cummer? and how doe ze thrive? And how mony bairns hae ze? Wom. Cummer, I hae five. Man. Are they to zour awin gude man? Wom. Na, Cummer, na; For four of tham were gotten, quhan Wallie was awa'. III. LITTLE JOHN NOBODY. We have here a witty libel on the Reformation under king Edward VI. written about the year 1550, and preserved in the Pepys collection, British Museum, and Strype's Mem. of Cranmer. The author artfully declines entering into the merits of the cause, and wholly reflects on the lives and actions of many of the Reformed. It is so easy to find flaws and imperfections in the conduct of men, even the best of them, and still easier to make general exclamations about the profligacy of the present times, that no great point is gained by arguments of that sort, unless the author could have proved that the principles of the Reformed Religion had a natural tendency to produce a corruption of manners: whereas he indirectly owns, that their reverend father [archbishop Cranmer] had used the most proper means to stem the torrent, by giving the people access to the scriptures, by teaching them to pray with understanding, and by publishing homilies, and other religious tracts. It must however be acknowledged, that our libeller had at that time sufficient room for just satire. For under the banners of the Reformed had inlisted themselves, many concealed papists, who had private ends to gratify; many that were of no religion; many greedy courtiers, who thirsted after the possessions of the church; and many dissolute persons, who wanted to be exempt from all ecclesiastical censures: And as these men were loudest of all others in their cries for Reformation, so in effect none obstructed the regular progress of it so much, or by their vicious lives brought vexation and shame more on the truly venerable and pious Reformers. The reader will remark the fondness of our Satirist for alliteration: in this he was guilty of no affectation or singularity; his versification is that of Pierce Plowman's Visions, in which a recurrence of similar letters is essential: to this he has only superadded rhyme, which in his time began to be the general practice. See farther remarks on this kind of metre in the preface to Book III. Ballad I. In december, when the dayes draw to be short, After november, when the nights wax noysome and long; As I past by a place privily at a port, I saw one sit by himself making a song: His last Perhaps He left talk. talk of trifles, who told with his tongue That few were fast i'th' faith. I ‘freyned feyned. MSS. and P. C.’ that freake, Whether he wanted wit, or some had done him wrong. He said, he was little John Nobody, that durst not speake. John Nobody, quoth I, what news? thou soon note and tell What maner men thou meane, that are so mad. He said, These gay gallants, that wil construe the gospel, As Solomon the sage, with semblance full sad; To discusse divinity they nought adread; More meet it were for them to milk kye at a fleyke. Thou lyest, quoth I, thou losel, like a leud lad. He said, he was little John Nobody, that durst not speake. Its meet for every man on this matter to talk, And the glorious gospel ghostly to have in mind; It is sothe said, that sect but much unseemly skalk, As boyes babble in books, that in scripture are blind: Yet to their fancy soon a cause wil find; As to live in lust, in lechery to leyke: Such caitives count to be come of Cains kind; So in Pierce the Plowman's creed, the proud friars are said to be ? “Of Caymes kind.” Vid. Sig. C. ij. b. But that I little John Nobody durst not speake. For our reverend father hath set forth an order, Our service to be said in our seignours tongue; As Solomon the sage set forth the scripture; Our suffrages, and service, with many a sweet song, With homilies, and godly books us among, That no stiff, stubborn stomacks we should freyke: But wretches nere worse to do poor men wrong; But that I little John Nobody dare not speake. For bribery was never so great, since born was our Lord, And whoredom was never les hated, sith Christ harrowed hel, And poor men are so sore punished commonly through the world, That it would grieve any one, that good is, to hear tel: For al the homilies and good books, yet their hearts be so quel, That if a man do amisse, with mischiefe they wil him wreake; The fashion of these new fellows it is so vile and fell: But that I little John Nobody dare not speake. Thus to live after their lust, that life would they have, And in lechery to leyke al their long life; For al the preaching of Paul, yet many a proud knave Wil move mischiefe in their mind both to maid and wife To bring them in advoutry, or else they wil strife, And in brawling about baudery, Gods commandments breake: But of these frantic il fellowes, few of them do thrife; Though I little John Nobody dare not speake. If thou company with them, they wil currishly carp, and not care According to their foolish fantacy; but fast wil they naught: Prayer with them is but prating; therefore they it forbear: Both almes deeds, and holiness, they hate it in their thought: Therefore pray we to that prince, that with his bloud us bought, That he wil mend that is amiss: for many a manful freyke Is sorry for these sects, though they say little or nought; And that I little John Nobody dare not once speake. Thus in no place, this Nobody, in no time I met, Where no man, ‘ne then. MSS. and P. C. nought was, nor nothing did appear; Through the sound of a synagogue for sorrow I swett, That ‘Aeolus Hercules, MSS. and P. C.’ through the eccho did cause me to hear. Then I drew me down into a dale, whereas the dumb deer Did shiver for a shower; but I shunted from a freyke: For I would no wight in this world wist who I were, But little John Nobody, that dare not once speake. IV. Q. ELIZABETH'S VERSES, WHILE PRISONER AT WOODSTOCK, Writ with charcoal on a shutter, —are preserved by Hentzner, in that part of his Travels, which has lately been reprinted in so elegant a manner at STRAWBERRY-HILL. In Hentzner's book they were wretchedly corrupted, but are here given as amended by his ingenious Editor. The old orthography, and one or two ancient readings of Hentzner's copy are here restored. Oh, Fortune! how thy restlesse wavering state Hath fraught with cares my troubled witt! Witnes this present prisonn, whither fate Could beare me, and the joys I quitt. Could beare, is an ancient idiom, equivalent to Did bear or Hath borne. See below the Beggar of Bednal Green, ver. 57. Could say. Thou causedest the guiltie to be losed From bandes, wherein are innocents inclosed: Causing the guiltles to be straite reserved, And freeing those that death had well deserved. But by her envie can be nothing wroughte, So God send to my foes all they have thoughte. A. D. MDLV. Elizabethe, Prisonner. V. THE HEIR OF LINNE. This old ballad is given from a copy in the editor's folio MS; some breaches and defects in which; rendered the insertion of a few supplemental stanzas necessary. These it is hoped the reader will pardon. From the Scottish phrases here and there discernable in this poem, it should seem to have been originally composed beyond the Tweed. The Heir of Linne appears not to have been a Lord of Parliament, but a Laird, whose title went along with his estate. Part the First. Lithe and listen, gentlemen, To sing a song I will beginne: It is of a lord of faire Scotlànd, Which was the unthrifty heire of Linne. His father was a right good lord, His mother a lady of high degree; But they, alas! were dead, him froe, And he lov'd keeping companie. To spend the daye with merry cheare, To drinke and revell every night, To card and dice from eve to morne, It was, I ween, his hearts delighte. To ride, to runne, to rant, to roare, To alwaye spend and never spare, I wott, an' it were the king himselfe, Of gold and fee he mote be bare. Soe fares the unthrifty lord of Linne Till all his gold is gone and spent; And he mun sell his landes so broad, His house, and landes, and all his rent. His father had a keen stewàrde, And John o' the Scales was called hee: But John is become a gentel-man, And John has gott both gold and fee. Sayes, Welcome, welcome, lord of Linne, Let nought disturb thy merry cheere, Iff thou wilt sell thy landes soe broad, Good store of gold Ile give thee heere. My gold is gone, my money is spent; My lande nowe take it unto thee: Give me the golde, good John o' the Scales, And thine for aye my lande shall bee. Then John he did him to record draw, And John he gave him a gods-pennie i. e. earnest-money; from the French ‘Denier à Dieu.’; But for every pounde that John agreed, The lande, I wis, was well worth three. He told him the gold upon the board, He was right glad his land to winne: The land is mine, the gold is thine, And now Ile be the lord of Linne. Thus he hath sold his land soe broad, Both hill and holt, and moore and fenne, All but a poore and lonesome lodge, That stood far off in a lonely glenne. For soe he to his father hight: My sonne, when I am gonne, sayd hee, Then thou wilt spend thy lande so broad, And thou wilt spend thy gold so free: But sweare me nowe upon the roode, That lonesome lodge thou'lt never spend; For when all the world doth frown on thee, Thou there shalt find a faithful friend. The heire of Linne is full of golde: And come with me, my friends, sayd hee, Let's drinke, and rant, and merry make, And he that spares, ne'er mote he thee. They ranted, drank, and merry made, Till all his gold it waxed thinne; And then his friendes they slunk away; They left the unthrifty heire of Linne. He had never a penny left in his purse, Never a penny left but three, The tone was brass, and the tone was lead, And tother it was white monèy. Nowe well-away, sayd the heire of Linne, Nowe well-away, and woe is mee, For when I was the lord of Linne, I never wanted gold or fee. But many a trustye friend have I, And why shold I feel dole or care? Ile borrow of them all by turnes, Soe need I not be never bare. But one, I wis, was not at home, Another had payd his gold away; Another call'd him thriftless loone, And bade him sharpely wend his way. Now well-away, sayd the heire of Linne, Now well-away, and woe is me! For when I had my landes so broad, On me they liv'd right merrilee. To beg my bread from door to door I wis, it were a brenning shame: To rob and steal it were a sinne: To worke my limbs I cannot frame. Now Ile away to lonesome lodge, For there my father bade me wend; When all the world should frown on mee, I there shold find a trusty friend. Part the Second. Away then hyed the heire of Linne O'er hill and holt, and moor and fenne, Untill he came to lonesome lodge, That stood so lowe in a lonely glenne. He looked up, he looked downe, In hope some comfort for to winne, But bare and lothly were the walles: Here's sorry cheare, quo' the heire of Linne. The little windowe dim and darke Was hung with ivy, brere, and yewe, No shimmering sunn here ever shone; No halesome breeze here ever blew. No chair, ne table he mote spye, No chearful hearth, ne welcome bed, Nought save a rope with renning noose, That dangling hung up o'er his head. And over it in broad lettèrs, These words were written so plain to see: “Ah! gracelesse wretch, hast spent thine all, “And brought thyselfe to penurìe? “All this my boding mind misgave, “I therefore left this trusty friend: “Let it now sheeld thy foule disgrace, “And all thy shame and sorrows end.” Sorely shent wi' this rebuke, Sorely shent was the heire of Linne, His heart, I wis, was near to brast With guilt and sorrowe, shame and sinne. Never a word spake the heire of Linne, Never a word he spake but three: “This is a trusty friend indeed, “And is right welcome unto mee.” Then round his necke the corde he drewe, And sprang aloft with his bodìe: When lo! the ceiling burst in twaine, And to the ground came tumbling hee. Astonyed lay the heire of Linne, Ne knewe if he were live or dead, At length he looked, and sawe a bille, And in it a key of gold so redd. He took the bill, and lookt it on, Strait good comfort found he there: It told him of a hole in the wall, In which there stood three chests in fere. Two were full of the beaten golde, The third was full of white monèy; And over them in broad lettèrs These words were written so plaine to see: “Once more, my sonne, I sette thee clere; “Amend thy life and follies past; “For but thou amend thee of thy life, “That rope must be thy end at last.” And let it bee, sayd the heire of Linne; And let it bee, but if I amend: i. e. unless I amend. For here I will make mine avow, This reade i. e. a vice, counsel. shall guide me to the end. Away then went the heire of Linne; Away he went with a merry cheare: I wis, he neither stint ne stayd, Till John o' the Scales house he came neare. And when he came to John o' the Scales, Up at the speere Perhaps the Hole in the door or window, by which it was speered, i. e. sparred, fastened. Query. then looked hee; There sate three lords at the bordes end, Were drinking of the wine so free. And then bespake the heire of Linne To John o' the Scales then louted hee: I pray thee now, good John o' the Scales, One forty pence for to lend mee. Away, away, thou thriftless loone; Away, away, this may not bee: For Christs curse on my head, he sayd, If ever I trust thee one pennìe. Then bespake the heire of Linne, To John o' the Scales wife then spake he: Madame, some almes on me bestowe, I pray for sweet saint Charitìe. Away, away, thou thriftless loone, I swear thou gettest no almes of mee; For if we shold hang any losel heere, The first we wold begin with thee. Then bespake a good fellòwe, Which sat at John o' the Scales his bord: Sayd, Turn againe, thou heire of Linne; Some time thou wast a well good lord: Some time a good fellow thou hast been, And sparedst not thy gold and fee, Therefore Ile lend thee forty pence, And other forty if need bee. And ever, I pray thee, John o' the Scales, To let him sit in thy companee: For well I wot thou hadst his land, And a good bargain it was to thee. Up then spake him John o' the Scales, All wood he answer'd him againe: Now Christs curse on my head, he sayd, But I did lose by that bargàine. And here I proffer thee, heire of Linne, Before these lords so faire and free, Thou shalt have it backe again better cheape, By a hundred markes, than I had it of thee. I drawe you to record, lords, he said. With that he gave him a gods pennèe: Now by my fay, sayd the heire of Linne, And here, good John, is thy monèy. And he pull'd forth three bagges of gold, And layd them down upon the bord: All woe begone was John o' the Scales, Soe shent he cold say never a word. He told him forth the good red gold, He told it forth with mickle dinne. The gold is thine, the land is mine, And now Ime againe the lord of Linne. Sayes, Have thou here, thou good fellòwe, Forty pence thou didst lend mee: Now I am againe the lord of Linne, And forty pounds I will give thee. Now welladay! sayth Joan o' the Scales: Now welladay! and woe is my life! Yesterday I was lady of Linne, Now Ime but John o' the Scales his wife. Now fare thee well, sayd the heire of Linne; Farewell, good John o' the Scales, said hee: When next I want to sell my land, Good John o' the Scales, Ile come to thee. VI. GASCOIGNE'S PRAISE OF THE FAIR BRIDGES, AFTERWARDS LADY SANDES, On her having a scar in her forehead. George Gascoigne was a celebrated poet in the early part of Q. Elizabeth's reign, and appears to great advantage among the miscellaneous writers of that age. He was author of three or four plays, and of many smaller poems; one of the most remarkable of which is a satire in blank verse, called the Steele-glass, 1576. 4to. Gascoigne was born in Essex, educated in both universities, whence he removed to Gray's-inn; but, disliking the study of the law, became first a dangler at court, and afterwards a soldier in the wars of the Low Countries. He had no great success in any of these pursuits, as appears from a poem of his, intitled, “Gascoigne's Wodmanship, written to lord Gray of Wilton.” Many of his epistles dedicatory are dated in 1575, 1576, from “his poore house in Walthamstoe:” where he died a middle-aged man in 1578, according to Anth. Wood: or rather in 1577, if he is the person meant in an old tract, intitled, “A remembrance of the well-employed Life and godly End of Geo. Gascoigne, Esq; who deceased at Stamford in Lincolnshire, Oct. 7. 1577. by Geo. Whetstone, Gent. an eyewitness of his godly and charitable end in this world,” 4to. no date.—[From a MS. of Oldys.] A very ingenious critic thinks “Gascoigne has much exceeded all the poets of his age, in smoothness and harmony of versification Observations on the Faerie Queen, Vol. II. p. 168..” But the truth is, scarce any of the earlier poets of Q. Elizabeth's time are found deficient in harmony and smoothness, tho' those qualities appear so rare in the writings of their successors. In the Paradise of dainty devises Printed in 1578, 1596, and perhaps oftener, in 4to, black lot., (the Dodsley's Miscellany of those times) will hardly be found one rough, or inharmonious line The same is true of most of the poems in the Mirrour of Magistrates, 1563, 4to, and even of Surrey's Poems, 1557.: whereas the numbers of Jonson, Donne, and most of their contemporaries, frequently offend the ear, like the filing of a saw.—Perhaps this is in some measure to be accounted for from the growing pedantry of that age, and from the writers affecting to run their lines into one another, after the manner of the Latin and Greek poets. The following poem (which the elegant writer above quoted hath recommended to notice, as possessed of a delicacy rarely to be seen in that early state of our poetry) properly consists of alexandrines of 12 and 14 syllables, and is printed from two quarto black-letter collections of Gascoigne's pieces; the first intitled, “A hundreth sundrie flowres, bounde up in one small posie, &amp;c. London, imprinted for Richarde Smith:” without date, but from a letter of H. W. (p. 202.) compared with the Printer's epist. to the Reader, it appears to have been published in 1572, or 3. The other is intitled, “The Posies of George Gascoigne, Esq; corrected, perfected, and augmented by the authour; 1575.—Printed at Lond. for Richard Smith, &amp;c.” No year, but the epist. dedicat. is dated 1576. In the title page of this last (by way of printer's Henrie Binneman., or bookseller's device) is an ornamental wooden cut, tolerably well executed, wherein time is represented drawing the figure of Truth out of a pit or cavern, with this legend, Occulta veritas tempore patet [r. s.] This is mentioned because it is not improbable but the accidental sight of this or some other title-page containing the same device, suggested to Rubens that well-known design of a similar kind, which he has introduced into the Luxemburg gallery Le Tems decouvre la Verite., and which has been so justly censured for the unnatural manner of its execution.—The device abovementioned being not ill adapted to the subject of this volume, is with some small variations copied in a plate, which to gratify the curiosity of the Reader is prefixed to Book III. In court whoso demaundes What dame doth most excell; For my conceit I must needes say, Faire Bridges beares the bel: Upon whose lively cheeke, To prove my judgment true, The rose and lillie seeme to strive For equall change of hewe: And therewithall so well Hir graces all agree, No frowning cheere dare once presume In hir sweet face to bee. Although some lavishe lippes, Which like some other best, Will say, the blemishe on hir browe Disgraceth all the rest. Thereto I thus replie, God wotte, they little knowe The hidden cause of that mishap, Nor how the harm did growe: For when dame Nature first Had framde hir heavenly face, And thoroughly bedecked it With goodly gleames of grace; It lyked hir so well: Lo here, quod she, a peece For perfect shape, that passeth all Appelles' worke in Greece. This bayt may chaunce to catche The greatest God of love, Or mightie thundring Jove himself, That rules the roast above. But out, alas! those wordes Were vaunted all in vayne; And some unseen wer present there, Pore Bridges, to thy pain. For Cupide, crafty boy, Close in a corner stoode, Not blyndfold then, to gaze on hir: I gesse it did him good. Yet when he felte the flame Gan kindle in his brest, And herd dame Nature boast by hir To break him of his rest, His hot newe-chosen love He chaunged into hate, And sodeynly with mightie mace Gan rap hir on the pate. It greeved Nature muche To see the cruell deede: Mee seemes I see hir, how she wept To see hir dearling bleede. Wel yet, quod she, this hurt Shal have some helpe I trowe: And quick with skin she coverd it, That whiter is than snowe. Wherwith Dan Cupide fled, For feare of further flame, When angel-like he saw hir shine, Whome he had smit with shame. Lo, thus was Bridges hurt In cradel of her kind: i. e. in the cradle of her family. Query.—See Warton's observations, vol. 2. p. 137.In cradel of hir kind: The coward Cupide brake his browe To wreke his wounded mynd. The skar still there remains; No force, there let it bee: There is no cloude that can eclipse So bright a sunne, as she. VII. FAIR ROSAMOND. Most of the circumstances in this popular story of king Henry II. and the beautiful Rosamond have been taken for fact by our English Historians; who, unable to account for the unnatural conduct of queen Eleanor in stimulating her sons to rebellion, have attributed it to jealousy, and supposed that Henry's amour with Rosamond was the object of that passion. Our old English annalists seem, most of them, to have followed Higden the monk of Chester, whose account with some enlargements is thus given by Stow. “Rosamond the fayre daughter of Walter lord Clifford, concubine to Henry II. (poisoned by queen Elianor, as some thought) dyed at Woodstocke [A. D. 1177.] where king Henry had made for her a house of wonderfull working; so that no man or woman might come to her, but he that was instructed by the king, or such as were right secret with him touching the matter. This house after some was named Labyrinthus, or Dedalus worke, which was wrought like unto a knot in a garden, called a Maze Consisting of vaults under ground, arched and walled with brick and stone, according to Drayton. See note on his Epistle of Rosamond.; but it was commonly said, that lastly the queene came to her by a clue of thridde, or silke, and so dealt with her, that she lived not long after: but when she was dead, she was buried at Godstow in an house of nunnes, beside Oxford, with these verses upon her tombe, “Hic jacet in tumba, Rosa mundi, non Rosa munda: Non redolet, sed olet, quæ redolere solet. “In English thus: “The rose of the world, but not the cleane flowre, “Is now here graven; to whom beauty was lent: “In this grave full darke nowe is her bowre, “That by her life was sweete and redolent: “But now that she is from this life blent, “Though she were sweete, now foully doth she stinke. “A mirrour good for all men, that on her thinke.” Stowe's Annals, Ed. 1631. p. 154. How the queen gained admittance into Rosamond's bower is differently related. Hollingshed speaks of it, as “the common report of the people, that the queene . . . founde hir out by a silken thread, which the king had drawne after him out of hir chamber with his foot, and dealt with hir in such sharpe and cruell wise, that she lived not long after.” Vol. III. p. 115. On the other hand, in Speede's Hist. we are told that the jealous queen found her out “by a clew of silke, fallen from Rosamund's lappe, as shee sate to take ayre, and suddenly fleeing from the sight of the searcher, the end of her silke fastened to her foot, and the clew still unwinding, remained behinde: which the queene followed, till shee had found what she sought, and upon Rosamund so vented her spleene, as the lady lived not long after.” 3d Edit. p. 509. Our ballad-maker with more ingenuity, and probably as much truth, tells us the clue was gained, by surprise, from the knight, who was left to guard her bower. It is observable, that none of the old writers attribute Rosamond's death to poison, (Stow, above, mentions it meerly as a slight conjecture); they only give us to understand, that the queen treated her harshly; which furious menaces, we may suppose, and sharp expostulations, which had such effect on her spirits, that she did not long survive it. Indeed on her tombstone, as we learn from a person of credit Tho. Allen of Gloc. Hall, Oxon. who died in 1632, aged 90. See Hearne's rambling discourse concerning Rosamond, at the end of Gul. Neubrig Hist. Vol. 3. p. 739., among other fine sculptures, was engraven the figure of a cup. This, which perhaps at first was an accidental ornament, might in after times suggest the notion that she was poisoned; at least this construction was put upon it, when the stone came to be demolished after the nunnery was dissolved. The account is, that “the tombstone of Rosamund Clifford was taken up at Godstow, and broken in pieces, and that upon it were interchangeable weavings drawn out and decked with roses red and green, and the picture of the cup, out of which she drank the poison given her by the queen, carved in stone.” Rosamond's father having been a great benefactor to the nunnery of Godstow, where she had also resided herself in the innocent part of her life, her body was conveyed there, and buried in the middle of the choir; in which place it remained till the year 1191, when Hugh bishop of Lincoln caused it to be removed. The fact is recorded by Hoveden, a contemporary writer, whose words are thus translated by Stow. “Hugh bishop of Lincolne came to the abbey of nunnes, called Godstow, . . . . and when he had entred the church to pray, he saw a tombe in the middle of the quire, covered with a pall of silke, and set about with lights of waxe: and demanding whose tombe it was, he was answered, that it was the tombe of Rosamond, that was some time lemman to Henry II. . . . . who for the love of her had done much good to that church. Then quoth the bishop, take out of this place the harlot, and bury her without the church, lest christian religion should grow in contempt, and to the end that, through example of her, other women being made afraid may beware, and keepe themselves from unlawfull and advouterous company with men.” Annals, p. 159. History further informs us, that king John repaired Godstow nunnery, and endowed it with yearly revenues, “that these holy virgins might releeve with their prayers, the soules of his father king Henrie, and of lady Rosamund there interred.” Vid. Reign of Henry II. in Speed's Hist. writ by Dr. Barchaw, Dean of Bocking. . . . . In what situation her remains were found at the dissolution of the nunnery, we learn from Leland, “Rosamundes tumbe at Godstowe nunnery was taken up [of] late; it is a stone with this inscription, Tumba Rosamundæ. Her bones were closid in lede, and withyn that bones were closyd yn lether. When it was opened a very swete smell came owt of it.” See Hearne's discourse above quoted, written in 1718; at which time, he tells us, were still seen by the pool at Woodstock the foundations of a very large building, which were believed to be the remains of Rosamond's labyrinth. To conclude this (perhaps too prolix) account, Henry had two sons by Rosamond, from a computation of whose ages, a modern historian has endeavoured to invalidate the received story. These were William Longue-espè (or Long-sword) earl of Salisbury, and Geoffrey bishop of Lincolne Afterwards Archbishop of York, temp. Rich. I.. Geoffrey was the younger of Rosamond's sons, and yet is said to have been twenty years old at the time of his election to that see in 1173. Hence this writer concludes, that king Henry fell in love with Rosamond in 1149, when in king Stephen's reign he came over to be knighted by the king of Scots; he also thinks it probable that Henry's commerce with this lady broke off upon his marriage with Eleanor [in 1152.] and that the young lady, by a natural effect of grief and resentment at the defection of her lover, entered on that occasion into the nunnery of Godstowe, where she died probably before the rebellion of Henry's sons in 1173.” [Carte's hist. Vol. I. p. 652.] But let it be observed, that Henry was but sixteen years old when he came over to be knighted; that he staid but eight months in this island, and was almost all the time with the king of Scots; that he did not return back to England till 1153, the year after his marriage with Eleanor; and that no writer drops the least hint of Rosamand's having ever been abroad with her lover, nor indeed is it probable that a boy of sixteen should venture to carry over a mistress to his mother's court. If all these circumstances are considered, Mr. Carte's account will be found more incoherent and improbable than that of the old ballad; which is also countenanced by most of our old historians. Indeed the true date of Geoffrey's birth, and consequently of Henry's commerce with Rosamund, seems to be best ascertained from an ancient manuscript in the Cotton library: wherein it is thus registered of Geofferey Plantagenet, “Natus est 5°. Hen. II. [1159.] Factus est miles 25°. Hen. II. [1179.] Elect. in Episcop. Lincoln. 28°. Hen. II. [1182.].” Vid. Chron. de Kirkstall. (Domitian XII.) Drake's Hist. of York, p. 422. The following ballad is printed from four ancient copies in black letter; two of them in the Pepys library. When as king Henry rulde this land, The second of that name, Besides the queene, he dearly lovde A faire and comely dame. Most peerlesse was her beautye founde, Her favour, and her face; A sweeter creature in this worlde Could never prince embrace. Her crisped lockes like threads of golde Appeard to each mans sight; Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearles, Did cast a heavenlye light. The blood within her crystal cheekes Did such a colour drive, As though the lillye and the rose For mastership did strive. Yea Rosamonde, fair Rosamonde, Her name was called so, To whom our queene, dame Ellinor, Was known a deadlye foe. The king therefore, for her defence, Against the furious queene, At Woodstocke builded such a bower, The like was never seene. Most curiously that bower was built Of stone and timber strong, An hundered and fifty doors Did to this bower belong: And they so cunninglye contriv'd With turnings round about, That none but with a clue of thread, Could enter in or out. And for his love and ladyes sake, That was so faire and brighte, The keeping of this bower he gave Unto a valiant knighte. But fortune, that doth often frowne Where she before did smile, The kinges delighte and ladyes joy Full soon shee did beguile: For why, the kinges ungracious sonne, Whom he did high advance, Against his father raised warres Within the realme of France. But yet before our comelye king The English land forsooke, Of Rosamond, his lady faire, His farewelle thus he tooke: “My Rosamonde, my only Rose, That pleasest best mine eye: The fairest flower in all the worlde To feed my fantasye: The flower of mine affected heart, Whose sweetness doth excelle: My royal Rose, a thousand times I bid thee nowe farewelle! For I must leave my fairest flower, My sweetest Rose, a space, And cross the seas to famous France, Proud rebelles to abase. But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt My coming shortlye see, And in my heart, when hence I am, Ile beare my Rose with mee.” When Rosamond, that ladye brighte, Did heare the king saye soe, The sorrowe of her grieved heart Her outward lookes did showe; And from her cleare and crystall eyes The teares gusht out apace, Which like the siver-pearled dewe Ranne downe her comely face. Her lippes, erst like the corall redde, Did waxe both wan and pale, And for the sorrow she conceivde Her vitall spirits faile; And falling down all in a swoone Before king Henryes face, Full oft he in his princelye armes Her bodye did embrace: And twentye times, with watery eyes, He kist her tender cheeke, Untill he had revivde againe Her senses milde and meeke. Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose? The king did often say. Because, quoth shee, to bloodye warres My lord must part awaye. But since your grace on forrayne coastes Amonge your foes unkinde Must goe to hazard life and limbe, Why should I staye behinde? Nay rather, let me, like a page, Your sworde and target beare; That on my breast the blowes may lighte, Which would offend you there. Or lett mee, in your royal tent, Prepare your bed at nighte, And with sweete baths refresh your grace, At your returne from fighte. So I your presence may enjoye No toil I will refuse; But wanting you, my life is death; Nay, death Ild rather chuse! “Content thy self, my dearest love; Thy rest at home shall bee In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle; For travell fits not thee. Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres; Soft peace their sexe delightes; ‘Not rugged campes, but courtlye bowers; Gay feastes, not cruell fightes.’ My Rose shall safely here abide, With musicke passe the daye; Whilst I, amonge the piercing pikes, My foes seeke far awaye. My Rose shall shine in pearle, and golde, Whilst Ime in armour dighte; Gay galliards here my love shall dance, Whilst I my foes goe fighte. And you, sir Thomas, whom I truste To bee my loves defence; Be carefull of my gallant Rose When I am parted hence.” And therewithall he fetcht a sigh, As though his heart would breake: And Rosamonde, for very griefe, Not one plaine word could speake. And at their parting well they mighte In heart be grieved sore: After that daye faire Rosamonde The king did see no more. For when his grace had past the seas, And into France was gone; With envious heart, queene Ellinor, To Woodstocke came anone. And forth she calles this trustye knighte, In an unhappy houre; Who with his clue of twined thread, Came from this famous bower. And when that they had wounded him, The queene this thread did gette, And went where ladye Rosamonde Was like an angell sette. But when the queene with stedfast eye Beheld her beauteous face, She was amazed in her minde At her exceeding grace. Cast off from thee those robes, she said, That riche and costlye bee; And drinke thou up this deadlye draught, Which I have brought to thee. Then presentlye upon her knees Sweet Rosamonde did falle; And pardon of the queene she crav'd For her offences all. “Take pitty on my youthfull yeares, Faire Rosamonde did crye; And lett mee not with poison stronge Enforced bee to dye. I will renounce my sinful life, And in some cloyster bide; Or else be banisht, if you please, To range the world soe wide. And for the fault which I have done, Though I was forc'd theretoe, Preserve my life, and punish mee As you thinke meet to doe.” And with these words, her lillie handes She wrunge full often there; And downe along her lovelye face Did trickle many a teare. But nothing could this furious queene Therewith appeased bee; The cup of deadlye poyson stronge, As she knelt on her knee, Shee gave this comelye dame to drinke; Who tooke it in her hand, And from her bended knee arose, And on her feet did stand: And casting up her eyes to heaven, Shee did for mercye calle; And drinking up the poison stronge, Her life she lost withalle. And when that death through everye limbe Had showde its greatest spite, Her chiefest foes did plaine confesse Shee was a glorious wight. Her body then they did entomb, When life was fled away, At Godstowe, neare to Oxford towne, As may be seene this day. VIII. QUEEN ELEANOR'S CONFESSION. “Eleanor, the daughter and heiress of William duke of Guienne, and count of Poictou, had been married sixteen years to Louis VII. king of France, and had attended him in a croisade, which that monarch commanded against the infidels; but having lost the affections of her husband, and even fallen under some suspicions of gallantry with a handsome Saracen, Louis, more delicate than politic, procured a divorce from her, and restored her those rich provinces, which by her marriage she had annexed to the crown of France. The young count of Anjou, afterwards Henry II. king of England, tho' at that time but in his nineteenth year, neither discouraged by the disparity of age, nor by the reports of Eleanor's gallantry, made such successful courtship to that princess, that he married her six weeks after her divorce, and got possession of all her dominions as a dowery. A marriage thus founded upon interest was not likely to be very happy: it happened accordingly. Eleanor, who had disgusted her first husband by her gallantries, was no less offensive to her second by her jealousy: thus carrying to extremity, in the different parts of her life, every circumstance of female weakness. She had several sons by Henry, whom she spirited up torebel against him; and endeavouring to escape to them disguised in man's apparel in 1173, she was discovered and thrown into a confinement, which seems to have contitinued till the death of her husband in 1189. She however survived him many years: dying in 1204, in the sixth year of the reign of her youngest son, John.” See Hume's Hist. 4to. Vol. 1. p. 260. 307. Speed, Stow, &amp;c. It is needless to observe, that the following ballad (given from an old printed copy) is altogether fabulous; whatever gallantries Eleanor encouraged in the time of her first husband, none are imputed to her in that of her second. Queene Elianor was a sicke womàn, And afraid that she should dye: Then she sent for two fryars of France To speke with her speedilye. The king calld downe his nobles all, By one, by two, by three; “Earl marshall, Ile goe shrive the queene, And thou shalt wend with mee.” A boone, a boone; quoth earl marshàll, And fell on his bended knee; That whatsoever queene Elianor saye, No harme therof may bee. Ile pawne my landes, the king then cryd, My sceptre, crowne, and all, That whatsoere queen Elianor sayes No harme thereof shall fall. Do thou put on a fryars coat, And Ile put on another; And we will to queen Elianor goe Like fryar and his brother. Thus both attired then they goe: When they came to Whitehall, The bells did ring, and the quiristers sing, And the torches did lighte them all. When that they came before the queene They fell on their bended knee; A boone, a boone, our gracious queene, That you sent so hastilee. Are you two fryars of France, she sayd, As I suppose you bee? But if you are two Englishe fryars, You shall hang on the gallowes tree. We are two fryars of France, they sayd, As you suppose we bee, We have not been at any masse Sith we came from the sea. The first vile thing that ever I did I will to you unfolde; Earl marshall had my maidenhed, Beneath this cloth of golde. Thats a vile sinne, then sayd the king; May God forgive it thee! Amen, amen, quoth earl marshall; With a heavye heart spake hee. The next vile thing that ever I did, To you Ile not denye, I made a boxe of poyson strong, To poison king Henrye. Thats a vile sinne, then sayd the king, May God forgive it thee! Amen, amen, quoth earl marshall; And I wish it so may bee. The next vile thing that ever I did, To you I will discover; I poysoned fair Rosamonde, All in fair Woodstocke bower. Thats a vile sinne, then sayd the king; May God forgive it thee! Amen, amen, quoth earl marshall; And I wish it so may bee. Do you see yonders little boye, A tossing of the balle? That is earl marshalls eldest sonne, She means that the eldest of these two was by the earl marshall, the youngest by the king. And I love him the best of all. Do you see yonders little boye, A catching of the balle? That is king Henryes youngest sonne, She means that the eldest of these two was by the earl marshall, the youngest by the king. And I love him the worst of all. His head is fashyond like a bull; His nose is like a boare. No matter for that, king Henrye cryd, I love him the better therfore. The king pulled off his fryars coate, And appeared all in redde: She shrieked, and cryd, and wrung her hands, And sayd she was betrayde. The king lookt over his left shoulder, And a grimme look looked hee, Earl marshall, he sayd, but for my oathe, Or hanged thou shouldst bee. IX. THE STURDY ROCK. The attribution of this poem is questionable. This poem, subscribed M. T. [perhaps invertedly for T. Marshall Vid. Athen. Oxen. p. 152. 316.] is preserved in The Paradise of daintie devises, quoted above in page 136—The two first stanzas may be found accompanied with musical notes in “An bowres recreation in musicke, &amp;c. by Richard Alison, Lond. 1606. 4to.:” usually bound up with 3 or 4 sets of “Madrigals set to music by Tho. Weelkes, Lond. 1597. 1600. 1608, 4to.” One of these madrigals is so compleat an example of the Bathos, that I cannot forbear presenting it to the reader. Thule, the period of cosmographie, Doth vaunt of Hecla, whose sulphurious fire Doth melt the frozen clime, and thaw the skie, Trinacrian Ætna's flames ascend not hier: These things seeme wondrous, yet more wondrous I, Whose heart with feare doth freeze, with love doth fry. The Andelusian merchant, that returnes Laden with cutchinele and china dishes, Reports in Spaine, how strangely Fogo burnes Amidst an ocean full of flying fishes: These things seeme wondrous, yet more wondrous I, Whose heart with feare doth freeze, with love doth fry. Mr. Weelkes seems to have been of opinion with many of his brethren of later times, that nonsense was best adapted to display the powers of musical composure. The sturdy rock for all his strength By raging seas is rent in twaine: The marble stone is pearst at length, With little drops of drizling rain: The oxe doth yeeld unto the yoke, The steele obeyeth the hammer stroke. The stately stagge, that seemes so stout, By yalping hounds at bay is set: The swiftest bird, that flies about, Is caught at length in fowlers net: The greatest fish, in deepest brooke, Is soone deceived by subtill hooke. Yea man himselfe, unto whose will All things are bounden to obey, For all his wit and worthie skill, Doth fade at length, and fall away. There is nothing but time doeth waste; The heavens, the earth consume at last. But vertue sits triumphing still Upon the throne of glorious fame: Though spiteful death mans body kill, Yet hurts he not his vertuous name: By life or death what so betides, The state of vertue never slides. X. THE BEGGAR'S DAUGHTER OF BEDNALL-GREEN. This popular old ballad was written in the reign of Elizabeth, as appears not only from ver. 23. where the arms of England are called the “Queenes armes;” but from its tune's being quoted in other old pieces, written in her time. See the ballad on Mary Ambree in this volume.—An ingenious gentleman has assured the Editor, that he has formerly seen another old song on the same subject, composed in a different measure from this; which was truly beautiful, if we may judge from the only stanza he remembered: in this it was said of the old beggar, that “down his neck ? his reverend lockes In comelye curles did wave; And on his aged temples grewe The blossomes of the grave.” The following ballad is chiefly given from the Editor's folio MS. compared with two ancient printed copies: the concluding stanzas, which contain the old Beggar's discovery of himself, are not however given from any of these, being very different from those of the vulgar ballad. They were communicated to the Editor in manuscript; but he will not answer for their being genuine: he rather thinks them the modern production of some person, who was offended at the absurdities, and inconsistencies, which so remarkably prevailed in this part of the song, as it stood before: whereas by the alteration of a few lines, the story is rendered much more affecting, and is reconciled to probability and true history. For this informs us, that at the decisive battle of Evesham, (fought Aug. 4. 1265.) when Simon de Montfort, the great earl of Leicester, was slain at the head of the barons, his eldest son Henry fell by his side, and in consequence of that defeat, his whole family sunk for ever, the king bestowing their great honours and possessions on his second son Edmund earl of Lancaster. Part the First. Itt was a blind beggar, had long lost his sight, He had a faire daughter of bewty most bright; And many a gallant brave suiter had shee, For none was soe comelye as pretty Bessee. And though shee was of favor most faire, Yett seeing shee was but a blinde beggars heyre, Of ancyent housekeepers despised was shee, Whose sonnes came as suitors to pretty Bessee. Wherefore in great sorrow faire Bessy did say, Good father, and mother, let me goe away To seeke out my fortune, whatever itt bee. Her suite then they granted to prettye Bessee. Then Bessy, that was of bewtye soe bright, All cladd in gray russett, and late in the night From father and mother alone parted shee; Who sighed and sobbed for prettye Bessee. Shee went till shee came to Stratford-le-Bowe; Then knew shee not whither, nor which way to goe: With teares shee lamented her hard destinìe, So sadd and so heavy was prettye Bessee. She kept on her journey untill it was day, And went unto Rumford along the hye way; Where at the Queenes armes entertained was shee: So faire and wel favoured was prettye Bessee. Shee had not beene there a month to an end, But master and mistres and all was her friend: And every brave gallant, that once did her see, Was strait-way enamourd of prettye Bessee. Great gifts they did send her of silver and gold, And in their songs daylye her love was extold; Her beautye was blazed in every degree; Soe faire and soe comelye was prettye Bessee. The yong men of Rumford in her had their joy; Shee shewd herself courteous, and modestlye coye; And at her commandment still wold they bee; Soe faire and soe comelye was pretty Bessee. Foure suitors att once unto her did goe; They craved her favor, but still shee sayd noe; I wold not wish gentles to marry with mee. Yett ever they honoured prettye Bessee. The first of them was a gallant yong knight, And he came unto her disguisde in the night: The second a gentleman of good degree, Who wooed and sued for prettye Bessee. A merchant of London, whose wealth was not small, He was the third suiter, and proper withall: Her masters own sonne the fourth man must bee, Who swore he wold dye for prettye Bessee. And, if thou wilt marry with mee, quoth the knight, Ile make thee a ladye with joy and delight; My hart's so inthralled by thy bewtìe, That soone I shall dye for prettye Bessee. The gentleman sayd, Come, marry with mee, As fine as a ladye my Bessy shal bee: My life is distressed: O heare me, quoth hee; And grant me thy love, my prettye Bessee. Let me bee thy husband, the merchant could say, Thou shalt live in London both gallant and gay My shippes shall bring home rych jewels for thee, And I will for ever love prettye Bessee. Then Bessy shee sighed, and thus shee did say, My father and mother I meane to obey; First gett their good will, and be faithful to mee, And you shall enjoye your prettye Bessee. To every one this answer shee made, Wherfore unto her they joyfullye sayd, This thing to fulfill wee all doe agree; But where dwells thy father, my prettye Bessee? My father, she sayd, is soone to be seene: The seely blind beggar of Bednall-greene, That daylye sits begging for charitìe, He is the good father of prettye Bessee. His markes and his tokens are knowen very well; He always is led with a dogg and a bell: A seely olde man God knoweth is hee, Yett hee is the father of prettye Bessee. Nay then, quoth the merchant, thou art not for mee: Nor, quoth the innholder, my wiffe shalt thou bee: I lothe, sayd the gentle, a beggars degree, And therefore, adewe, my prettye Bessee! Why then, quoth the knight, hap better or worse, I weighe not true love by the weight of the pursse, And bewtye is bewtye in every degree; Then welcome unto mee, my prettye Bessee. With thee to thy father forthwith I will goe. Nay soft, quoth his kinsmen, it must not be soe; A poor beggars daughter noe ladye shal bee, Then take thy adew of prettye Bessee. But soone after this, by breake of the day The knight had from Rumford stole Bessy away. The yonge men of Rumford, as thicke as might bee, Rode after to feitch againe prettye Bessee. As swifte as the winde to ryde they were seene, Untill they came neare unto Bednall-greene; And as the knight lighted most curteouslìe, They all fought against him for prettye Bessee. But rescu came speedilye over the plaine, Or else the young knight for his love had beene slaine. This fray being ended, then straitway he see His kinsmen come rayling at prettye Bessee. Then spake the blind beggar, Although I be poore, Yett rayle not against my child at my owne door: Though shee be not decked in velvett and pearle, Yett I will dropp angells with you for my girle. And then, if my gold may better her birthe, And equall the gold that you lay on the earth, Then neyther rayle nor grudge you to see The blind beggars daughter a lady to bee. But first you shall promise, and have itt well knowne, The gold that you drop shall all be your owne. With that they replyed, Contented bee wee. Then here's, quoth the beggar, for prettye Bessee. With that an angell he cast on the ground, And dropped in angels full three thousand pound; And oftentimes it was proved most plaine, For the gentlemens one the beggar dropt twayne: Soe that the place, wherein they did sitt, With gold it was covered every whitt. The gentlemen then having dropt all their store, Sayd, Now, beggar, hold, for we have no more. Thou hast fulfilled thy promise aright. Then marry my girle, quoth he to the knight; And heere, added hee, I will now throwe you downe A hundred pounds more to buy her a gowne. The gentlemen all, that this treasure had seene, Admired the beggar of Bednall-greene: And all those, that were her suitors before, Their fleshe for very anger they tore. Thus was faire Bessy a match for the knight, And then made a ladye in others despite: A fairer ladye there never was seene, Than the blind beggars daughter of Bednall-greene. But of their sumptuous marriage and feast, What brave lords and knights thither were prest, The second fit The word fit, for part, often occurs in our ancient ballads and metrical romances; which being divided into several parts for the convenience of singing them at public entertainments, were in the intervals of the feast sung by fits, or intermissions. So Puttenham in his Art of English poesie, 1589, says “the Epithalamie was divided by breaches into three partes to serve for three several fits, or times to be sung.” p. 41.— From the same writer we learn some curious particulars relative to the state of ballad-singing in that age, that will throw light on the present subject: speaking of the quick returns of one manner of tune in the short measures used by common rhymers; these, he says, “glut the eare, unless it be in small and popular musickes, sung by these Cantabanqui, upon benches and barrels heads, where they have none other audience then boys or countrey fellowes, that passe by them in the streete; or else by blind harpers, or such like taverne Minstrels, that give a fit of mirth for a groat, . . their matter being for the most part stories of old time, as the tale of Sir Topas, the reportes of Bevis of Southampton, Guy of Warwicke, Adam Bell and Clymme of the Clough, and such other old romances or historical rimes, made purposely for recreation of the common people at Christmasse dinners and brideales, and in tavernes and alehouses, and such other places of base resorte.” p. 69. This species of entertainment, which seems to have been handed down from the ancient bards, was in the time of Puttenham falling apace into neglect; but that it was not, even then, wholly excluded more genteel assemblies, he gives us room to infer from another passage. “We ourselves, says this courtly He was one of Q. Elizabeth's gent. pensioners, at a time when the whole band consisted of men of distinguished birth and fortune. Vid. Atb. Ox. writer, have written for pleasure a little brief romance, or historical ditty in the English tong of the Isle of Great Britaine in short and long meetres, and by breaches or divisions [i. e. fits,] to be more commodiously sung to the harpe in places of assembly, where the company shal be desirous to heare of old adventures, and valiaunces of noble knights in times past, as are those of king Arthur and his knights of the Round table, Sir Bevys of Southampton, Guy of Warwicke, and others like.” p. 33. In more ancient times no grand scene of festivity was compleat without one of these reciters to entertain the company with feats of arms, and tales of knighthood, or, as one of these old minstrels says, in the beginning of an ancient romance in the Editor's folio MS. “When meate and drinke is great plentyè, “And lords and ladyes still wil bee, “And sitt and solace Perhaps “blythe.” lythe; “Then itt is time for mee to speake “Of keene knightes, and kempès great, “Such carping for to kythe.” If we consider that a groat in the age of Elizabeth was more than equivalent to a shilling now, we shall find that the old harpers were even then, when their art was on the decline, upon a far more reputable footing than the ballad-singers of our time. The reciting of one such ballad as this of the Beggar of Bednal-green, in II parts, was rewarded with half a crown of our money. And that they made a very respectable appearance, we may learn from the dress of the old beggar, in the following stanzas, ver. 34, where he comes into company in the habit and character of one of these minstrels, being not known to be the bride's father, till after her speech, ver. 63. The exordium of his song, and his claiming a groat for his reward, v. 76, are peculiarly characteristic of that profession.—Most of the old ballads begin in a pompous manner, in order to captivate the attention of the audience, and induce them to purchase a recital of the song: and they seldom conclude the first part without large promises of still greater entertainment in the second. This was a necessary piece of art to incline the hearers to be at the expence of a second groat's-worth—Many of the old romances extend to eight or nine fits, which would afford a considerable profit to the reciter. To return to the word fit; it seems at first to have peculiarly signified the pause, or breathing-time between the several parts, (answering to Passus in the visions of Pierce Plowman): thus in the old poem of John the Reeve, the first part ends with this line, “The first fitt here find wee:” i. e. here we come to the first pause or intermission See also above, Vol. I. p. 9.—The reader will find further remarks on the word Fit at the end of this Volume, and in the Glossary to Vol. I. &amp;c..—By degrees it came to signify the whole part or division preceding the pause; and this sense it had obtained so early as the time of Chaucer: who thus concludes the first part of his rhyme of Sir Thopas (writ in ridicule of the old ballad romances) “Lo! lordis mine, here is a fitt; “If ye woll any more of it, “To tell it woll I fonde.” shall set forth to your sight With marveilous pleasure, and wished delight. Part the Second. Within a gorgeous palace most brave, Adorned with all the cost they colde have, This wedding was kept most sumptuouslìe, And all for the creditt of prettye Bessee. All kind of dainties, and delicates sweete Were bought for their banquet, as it was meete; Partridge, and plover, and venison most free, Against the brave wedding of pretty Bessee. This wedding through England was spread by report, So that a great number therto did resort Of nobles and gentles in every degree; And all for the fame of prettye Bessee. To church then went this gallant young knight; His bride followed after, an angell most bright, With troopes of ladyes, the like nere was seene That went with sweete Bessy of Bednall-greene. This marryage being solemnized then, With musicke performed by the skilfullest men, The nobles and gentles sate downe at that tyde, Each one admiring the beautifull bryde. Now, after the sumptuous dinner was done, To talke, and to reason a number begunn: They talkt of the blind beggars daughter most bright, And what with his daughter he gave to the knight. Then spake the nobles, “Much marveil have wee, This jolly blind beggar we cannot here see.” My lords, quoth the bride, my father's so base, He is loth with his presence these states to disgrace. “The prayse of a woman in questyon to bringe Before her own face, were a flattering thinge; But wee thinke thy father's baseness, quoth they, Might by thy bewtye be cleane put awaye.” They had no sooner these pleasant words spoke, But in comes the beggar clad in a silke cloke; A faire velvet capp, and a fether had hee, And now a musicyan forsooth he wold bee. He had a daintye lute under his arme, He touched the strings, which made such a charme, Saies, Please you to heare any musicke of mee, Ile sing you a song of prettye Bessee. With that his lute he twanged straightway, And thereon begann most sweetlye to play; And after that lessons were playd two or three, He strayn'd out this song most delicatelìe. “A poore beggars daughter did dwell on a greene, “Who for her fairenesse might well be a queene: “A blithe bonny lasse, and a dainty was shee, “And many one called her prettye Bessee. “Her father he had noe goods, nor noe land, “But beggd for a penny all day with his hand; “And yett to her marriage he gave thousands three, “And still he hath somewhat for prettye Bessee. “And if any one here her birth doe disdaine, “Her father is ready, with might and with maine, “To prove shee is come of noble degree: “Therfòre never flout at prettye Bessee.” With that the lords and the company round With hearty laughter were readye to swound; At last sayd the lords, Full well wee may see, The bride and the beggar's beholden to thee. On this the bride all blushing did rise, The pearlie dropps standing within her faire eyes, O pardon my father, grave nobles, quoth shee, That throughe blind affection thus doteth on mee. If this be thy father, the nobles did say, Well may he be proud of this happy day; Yett by his countenance well may we see, His birth and his fortune did never agree: And therfore, blind man, we pray thee bewray, (And looke that the truth thou to us doe say) Thy birth and thy parentage, what it may bee; For the love that thou bearest to prettye Bessee. “Then give me leave, nobles and gentles, each one, “One song more to sing, and then I have done; “And if that itt may not winn good report, “Then do not give me a groat for my sport. “[Sir Simon de Montfort my subject shal bee; “Once chiefe of all the great barons was hee, “Yet fortune so cruelle this lorde did abase, “Now loste and forgotten are hee and his race. “When the barons in armes did king Henrye oppose, “Sir Simon de Montfort their leader they chose; “A leader of courage undaunted was hee, “And oft-times hee made their enemyes flee. “At length in the battle on Eveshame plaine “The barons were routed, and Montfort was slaine; “Moste fatall that battel did prove unto thee, “Thoughe thou wast not borne then, my prettye Bessee! “Along with the nobles, that fell at that tyde, “His eldest son Henrye, who fought by his side, “Was fellde by a blowe, he receivde in the fight! “A blowe that deprivde him for ever of sight. “Among the dead bodyes all lifelesse he laye, “Till evening drewe on of the following daye, “When by a yong ladye discoverd was hee; “And this was thy mother, my prettye Bessee! “A barons faire daughter stept forth in the nighte “To search for her father, who fell in the fight, “And seeing yong Montfort, where gasping he laye, “Was moved with pitye, and brought him awaye. “In secrette she nurst him, and swaged his paine, “While he throughe the realme was beleevd to be slaine: “At lengthe his faire bride she consented to bee, “And made him glad father of prettye Bessee. “And nowe lest oure foes oure lives sholde betraye, “We clothed ourselves in beggars arraye; “Her jewelles shee solde, and hither came wee: “All our comfort and care was our prettye Bessee. “And here have we lived in fortunes despite, “Thoughe meane, yet contented with humble delighte: “Thus many longe winters nowe have I beene “The sillye blinde beggar of Bednall-greene. “And here, noble lordes, is ended the songe “Of one, that once to your own ranke did belong: “And thus have you learned a secrette from mee, “That ne'er had beene knowne, but for prettye Bessee.” Now when the faire companye everye one, Had heard the strange tale in the song he had showne, They all were amazed, as well they might bee, Both at the blinde beggar, and prettye Bessee. With that the sweete maiden they all did embrace, Saying, Sure thou art come of an honourable race, Thy father likewise is of noble degree, And thou art right worthy a ladye to bee. Thus was the feast ended with joye, and delighte, A bridegroome most happye then was the yong knighte, In joye and felicitie long lived hee, All with his faire ladye, the prettye Bessee. XI. FANCY AND DESIRE. By the Earl of Oxford. Edward Vere Earl of Oxford was in high fame for his poetical talents in the reign of Elizabeth: perhaps it is no injury to his reputation that few of his compositions are preserved for the inspection of impartial posterity. To gratify curiosity, we have inserted a sonnet of his, which is quoted with great encomiums for its “excellencie and wit,” in Puttenham's Arte of Eng. Poesie Lond. 1589. p. 172., and found intire in the Garland of Good-will: A few more of his sonnets (distinguished by the initial letters E. O.) may be seen in the Paradise of Daintie Devises. One of these is intitled, “The Complaint of a Lover, wearing blacke and tawnie.” The only lines in it worth notice are these, A crowne of baies shall that man ‘beare’ Who triumphs over me; For black and tawnie will I weare, Which mourning colours be. We find in Hall's Chronicle, that when Q. Catharine of Arragon dyed Jan. 8. 1536; “Queen Anne [Bullen] ware “yellowe for the mourning.” And when this unfortunate princess lost her head May 19. the same year, “on the ascencion day following, the kyng for mourning ware “whyte.” Fol. 227, 228. Edward, who was the XVIIth earl of Oxford of the family of Vere, succeeded his father in his title and honours in 1562, and died an aged man in 1604. See Mr. Walpole's Noble Authors. Ath. Ox. Come hither shepherd's swayne: “Sir, what do you require?” I praye thee, shewe to me thy name. “My name is fond desire.” When wert thou borne, Desire? “In pompe and pryme of may.” By whom, sweet boy, wert thou begot? “By fond Conceit men say.” Tell me, who was thy nurse? “Fresh Youth in sugred joy.” What was thy meate and dayly foode? “Sad sighes with great annoy.” What hadst thou then to drinke? “Unsavoury lovers teares.” What cradle wert thou rocked in? “In hope devoyde of feares.” What lulld thee then asleepe? “Sweete speech, which likes me best.” Tell me, where is thy dwelling place? “In gentle hartes I rest.” What thing doth please thee most? “To gaze on beautye stille.” Whom dost thou thinke to be thy foe? “Disdayn of my good wille.” Doth companye displease? “Yea, surelye, many one.” Where doth Desire delighte to live? “He loves to live alone.” Doth either tyme or age Bringe him unto decaye? “No, no, Desire both lives and dyes “Ten thousand times a daye.” Then, fond Desire, farewelle, Thou art no mate for mee; I sholde be lothe, methinkes, to dwelle With such a one as thee. XII. SIR ANDREW BARTON. I cannot give a better relation of the fact, which is the subject of the following ballad, than in an extract from a very elegant work lately offered to the public. See Mr. Guthrie's New Peerage, 4to Vol. I. p. 22. “The transaction which did the greatest honour to the earl of Surrey Afterwards created Duke of Norfolk. and his family at this time [A. D. 1511.] was their behaviour in the case of Barton, a Scotch sea-officer. This gentleman's father having suffered by sea from the Portuguese, he had obtained letters of marque for his two sons to make reprisals upon the subjects of Portugal. It is extremely probable, that the court of Scotland granted these letters with no very honest intention. The council board of England, at which the earl of Surrey held the chief place, was daily pestered with complaints from the sailors and merchants, that Barton, who was called Sir Andrew Barton, under pretence of searching for Portuguese goods, interrupted the English navigation. Henry's situation at that time rendered him backward from breaking with Scotland, so that their complaints were but coldly received. The earl of Surrey, however, could not smother his indignation, but gallantly declared at the council board, that while he had an estate that could furnish out a ship, or a son that was capable of commanding one, the narrow seas should not be infested. “Sir Andrew Barton, who commanded the two Scotch ships, had the reputation of being one of the ablest sea-officers of his time. By his depredations, he had amassed great wealth, and his ships were very richly laden. Henry, notwithstanding his situation, could not refuse the generous offer made by the earl of Surrey. Two ships were immediately fitted out, and put to sea with letters of marque, under his two sons, Sir Thomas Called by old historians lord Howard, afterwards created earl of Surrey in his father's life-time. and Sir Edward Howard. After encountering a great deal of foul weather, Sir Thomas came up with the Lion, which was commanded by Sir Andrew Barton in person; and Sir Edward came up with the Union, Barton's other ship, [called by Hall, the bark of Scotland.] The engagement which ensued was extremely obstinate on both sides; but at last the fortune of the Howards prevailed. Sir Andrew was killed fighting bravely, and encouraging his men with his whistle, to hold cut to the last; and the two Scotch ships with their crews, were carried into the river Thames, [Aug. 2. 1511.] “This exploit had the more merit, as the two English commanders were in a manner volunteers in the service, by their father's order. But it seems to have laid the foundation of Sir Edward's fortune; for on the 7th of April 1512, the king constituted him (according to Dugdale) admiral of England, Wales, &amp;c, “King James ‘insisted’ upon satisfaction for the death of Barton, and capture of his ship: ‘tho’ Henry had generously dismissed the crews, and even agreed that the parties accused might appear in his courts of admiralty by their attornies, to vindicate themselves.” This affair was in a great measure the cause of the battle of Flodden, in which James IV. lost his life. IN the following ballad will be found perhaps some few deviations from the truth of history: to atone for which it has probably recorded many lesser facts, which history hath not condescended to relate. I take many of the little circumstances of the story to be real, because I find one of the most unlikely to be not very remote from the truth. In Pt. 2. v. 156. it is said, that England had before “but two ships of war.” Now the great Harry had been built for seven years before, viz. in 1504: which “was properly speaking the first ship in the English navy. Before this period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient but hiring ships from the merchants.” Hume. The following copy (which is given from the Editor's folio MS. and seems to have been written early in the reign of Elizabeth, if not before,) will be found greatly superior to the vulgar ballad, which is evidently modernized and abridged from it. Some few deficiences are however supplied from a black-letter copy of the latter in the Pepys collection. The First Part. ‘When Flora with her fragrant flowers ‘Bedekt the earth so trim and gaye, ‘And Neptune with his daintye showers ‘Came to present the monthe of Maye; From the pr. copy.’ King Henrye rode to take the ayre, Over the river of Thames past hee; When eighty merchants of London came, And downe they knelt upon their knee. “O yee are welcome, rich merchànts; Good saylors, welcome unto mee.” They swore by the rood, they were saylors good, But rich merchànts they colde not bee: “To France nor Flanders dare we pass: Nor Bourdeaux voyage dare we fare; And all for a rover that lyes on the seas, Who robbs us of our merchant ware.” King Henrye frownd, and turned him rounde, And swore by the Lord, that was mickle of might, “I thought he had not been in the world, Durst have wrought England such unright.” The merchants sighed, and said, alas! And thus they did their answer frame, Hee is a proud Scott, that robbs on the seas, And Sir Andrewe Barton is his name. The king lookt over his left shouldèr, And an angrye look then looked hee: “Have I never a lorde in all my realme, Will fetch yon traytor unto mee?” Yea, that dare I; lord Howard sayes; Yea, that dare I with heart and hand; If it please your grace to give me leave, Myselfe wil be the only man. Thou art but yong; the king replyed: Yond Scott hath numbred manye a yeare. “Trust me, my liege, Ile make him quail, Or before my prince I will never appeare.” Then bowemen and gunners thou shalt have, And chuse them over my realme so free; Besides good mariners, and shipp-boyes, To guide the great shipp on the sea. The first man, that lord Howard chose, Was the ablest gunner in all the rea'm, Thoughe he was threescore yeeres and ten: Good Peter Simon was his name. Peter, sayd he, I must to the sea, To bring home a traytor live or dead: Before all others I have chosen thee; Of a hundred gunners to be head. If you, my lord, have chosen me Of a hundred gunners to be head, Then hang me up on your maine-mast tree, If I misse my marke one shilling bread An old Erg. word for Breadth.. My lord then chose a boweman rare, ‘Whose active hands had gained fame,’ Pr. copy. In Yorkshire he was a gentleman borne, And William Horseley was his name. Horseley, sayd he, I must with speede Go seeke a traytor on the sea, And now of a hundred bowemen brave To be the head I have chosen thee. If you, quoth hee, have chosen mee Of a hundred bowemen to be head; On your maine-màst Ile hanged bee, If I miss twelvescore one penny bread An old Erg. word for Breadth.. With pikes and gunnes, and bowemen bold, The noble Howard is gone to the sea; With a valyant heart and a pleasant cheare, Out at Thames mouth sayled he. And days he scant had sayled three, Upon the ‘voyage’, he tooke in hand, But there he met with a noble shipp, And stoutly made it stay and stand. Thou must tell me, lord Howard sayes, Now who thou art, and what's thy name; And shewe me where thy dwelling is: And whither bound, and whence thou came. My name is Henry Hunt, quoth hee With a heavye heart, and a carefull mind; I and my shipp doe both belong To the Newcastle, that stands upon Tyne. Hast thou not heard, nowe, Henrye Hunt, As thou hast sayled by daye and by night, Of a Scottish rover on the seas; Men call him sir Andrew Barton, knighte? Than ever he sighed, and sayd alas! With a grieved mind, and well away! But over-well I knowe that wight, I was his prisoner yesterday. As I was sayling upon the sea, A Burdeaux voyage for to fare; To his arch-borde Perhaps Hatch-borde. he clasped me, And robd me of all my merchant ware: And mickle debts, God wot, I owe, And every man will have his owne; And I am nowe to London bounde, Of our gracious king to beg a boone. You shall not need, lord Howard sayes; Lett me but once that robber see, For every penny tane thee froe It shall be doubled shillings three. Nowe God foresend, the merchant sayes, That you shold seek soe far amisse! God keepe you out o' that traitors handes! Full litle ye wott what a man he is. He is brasse within, and steele without. With beames on his topcastle stronge; And thirtye pieces of ordinance He carries on each side along: And he hath a pinnace deerlye dight, St. Andrewes crosse itt is his guide; His pinnace beareth ninescore men, And fifteen canons on each side. Were ye twentye shippes, and he but one; I sweare by kirke, and bower, and hall; He wold orecome them every one, If once his beames they doe downe fall. This is cold comfort, sayes my lord, To welcome a stranger on the sea: Yet Ile bring him and his shipp to shore, Or to Scotland he shall carrye mee. Then a noble gunner you must have, And he must aim well with his ee, And sinke his pinnace in the sea, Or else he ne'er orecome will be: And if you chance his shipp to borde, This counsel I must give withall, Let no man to his topcastle goe To strive to let his beams downe fall. And seven pieces of ordinance, I pray your honour lend to mee, On each side of my shipp along, And I will lead you on the sea. A glasse Ile sett, that may be seene, Whether you sayle by day or night; And to-morrowe, I sweare, by nine of the clocke You shall see Sir Andrewe Barton knight. The Second Part. The merchant sett my lorde a glasse Soe well apparent in his sight, And on the morrowe, by nine of the clocke, He shewed him Sir Andrewe Barton knight. His hatchborde it was ‘gilt’ with gold, ‘hatched with gold.” MS. Soe deerlye dight it dazzled the ee: Nowe by my faith, lord Howarde says, This is a gallant sight to see. Take in your ancyents, standards eke, So close that no man may them see; And put me forth a white willowe wand, As merchants use that sayle the sea. But they stirred neither top, nor mast; Stoutly they past Sir Andrew by. What English churles are yonder, he sayd, That can soe little curtesye? Now by the roode, three yeares and more I have beene admirall over the sea; And never an English nor Portingall Without my leave can passe this way. Then called he forth his stout pinnace; “Fetch backe yond pedlars nowe to mee: I sweare by the masse, yon English churles Shall all hang at my maine-mast tree. With that the pinnace itt shott off, Full well lord Howard might it ken; For it strake downe his fore-mast tree, And killed fourteen of his men. Come hither, Simon, sayes my lord, Looke that thy word doe stand in stead; For at my maine-mast thou shalt hang, If thou misse thy marke one shilling bread. Simon was old, but his heart was bolde. His ordinance he laid right lowe; He put in chaine full nine yardes long, With other great shott lesse, and moe; And he lette goe his great gunnes shott; Soe well he settled itt with his ee, The first sight that Sir Andrewe sawe, He sawe his pinnace sunke i' the sea. And when he saw his pinnace sunke, Lord, how his heart with rage did swell! Nowe cutt my ropes, itt is time to be gon; Ile fetch yond pedlars backe mysel.” When my Lord sawe Sir Andrewe loose, Within his heart hee was full faine: “Nowe spread your ancyents, strike up drummes, Sound all your trumpetts out amaine.” Fight on, my men, Sir Andrewe sayes, Weale howsoever this geere will sway; Itt is my lord admirall of Englànd, Is come to seeke mee on the sea. Simon had a sonne, who shott right well, That did Sir Andrewe mickle scare; In att his decke he gave a shott, Killed threescore of his men of warre. Then Henrye Hunt with rigour hott Came bravely on the other side, Soone he drove downe his fore-mast tree, And killed fourscore men beside. Nowe, out alas! Sir Andrewe cryed, What may a man now thinke, or say? Yonder merchant theefe, that pierceth mee, He was my prisoner yesterday. Come hither to me, thou Gordon good, That aye wast readye at my call; I will give thee three hundred markes, If thou wilt let my beames downe fall. Lord Howard hee then calld in haste, “Horseley see thou be true in stead; For thou shalt at the maine-mast hang, If thou misse twelvescore one penny bread. Then Gordon swarvd the maine-mast tree, He swarved it with might and maine; But Horseley with a bearing arrowe, Stroke the Gordon through the braine; And he fell downe to the hatches again, And sore his deadlye wounde did bleed: Then word went through Sir Andrews men, How that the Gordon he was dead. Come hither to mee, James Hambilton, Thou art my only sisters sonne, If thou wilt let my beames downe fall, Six hundred nobles thou hast wonne. With that he swarvd the maine-mast tree, He swarved it with nimble art; But Horseley with a broad arròwe Pierced the Hambilton thorough the heart: And downe he fell upon the deck, That with his blood did streame amaine: Then every Scott cryed, Well-away! Alas a comelye youth is slaine! All woe begone was Sir Andrew then, With griefe and rage his heart did swell: “Go fetch me forth my armour of proofe, For I will to the topcastle mysel.” “Goe fetch me forth my armour of proofe, That gilded is with gold soe cleare: God be with my brother John of Barton! Against the Portingals hee it ware; And when he had on this armour of proofe, He was a gallant sight to see: Ah! nere didst thou meet with living wight, My deere brothèr, could cope with thee.” Come hither Horseley, says my lord, And looke to your shaft that it goe right, Shoot a good shoot in time of need, And for it thou shalt be made a knight. Ile shoot my best, quoth Horseley then, Your honour shall see, with might and maine; But if I were hanged at your maine-mast tree, I have now left but arrowes twaine. Sir Andrew he did swarve the tree, With right good will he swarved then: Upon his breast did Horseley hitt, But the arrow bounded back agen. Then Horseley spyed a privye place With a perfect eye in a secrette part; Under the spole of his right arme He smote Sir Andrew to the heart. “Fight on, my men, Sir Andrew sayes, A little Ime hurt, but yett not slaine; Ile but lye downe and bleede a while, And then Ile rise and fight againe. “Fight on, my men, Sir Andrew sayes, And never flinche before the foe; And stand fast by St. Andrewes crosse Untill you heare my whistle blowe.” They never heard his whistle blow,— Which made their hearts waxe sore adread: Then Horseley sayd, Aboard, my lord, For well I wott Sir Andrew's dead. They boarded then his noble shipp, They boarded it with might and maine; Eighteen score Scotts alive they found, The rest were either maimd or slaine. Lord Howard tooke a sword in hand, And off he smote Sir Andrewes head; “I must ha' left England many a daye, If thou wert alive as thou art dead.” He caused his body to be cast Over the hatchborde into the sea, And about his middle three hundred crownes: “Wherever thou land this will burye thee.” Thus from the warres lord Howard came, And backe he sayled ore the maine, With mickle joy and triumphìng Into Thames mouth he came againe. Lord Howard then a letter wrote, And sealed it with seale and ring; “Such a noble prize have I brought to your grace, As never did subject to a king. “Sir Andrewes shipp I bring with mee; A braver shipp was never none: Nowe hath your grace two shipps of warre, Before in England was but one.” King Henryes grace with royall cheere Welcomed the noble Howard home, And where, said he, is this rover stout, That I myselfe may give the doome? “The rover, he is safe, my leige, Full many a fadom in the sea; If he were alive as he is dead, I must ha' left England many a day: And your grace may thank four men i' the ship For the victory wee have wonne, These are William Horseley, Henry Hunt, And Peter Simon, and his sonne.” To Henry Hunt, the king then sayd, In lieu of what was from thee tane, A noble a day now thou shalt have, Sir Andrewes jewels and his chayne.” And Horseley thou shalt be a knight, And lands and livings shalt have store; Howard shall be earle Surrye hight, As Howards erst have beene before. Nowe, Peter Simon, thou art old, I will maintaine thee and thy sonne: And the men shall have five hundred markes For the good service they have done. Then in came the queene with ladyes fair To see Sir Andrewe Barton knight: They weend that hee were brought on shore, And thought to have seen a gallant sight. But when they see his deadlye face, And eyes soe hallowe in his head, I wold give, quoth the king, a thousand markes, This man were alive as he is dead: Yet for the manfull part he playd, Which fought soe well with heart and hand, His men shall have twelvepence a day, Till they come to my brother kings high land. XIII. LADY ANNE BOTHWELL'S LAMENT. A Scottish Song. The subject of this pathetic ballad the Editor once thought might possibly relate to the Earl of Bothwell, and his desertion of his wife Lady Jean Gordon, to make room for his marriage with the Queen of Scots: But this opinion he now believes to be groundless; indeed earl Bothwell's age, who was upwards of 60 at the time of that marriage, renders it unlikely that he should be the object of so warm a passion as this elegy supposes. He has been since informed, that it entirely refers to a private story: A lady of quality of the name of Bothwell, or rather Boswell, having been, together with her child, deserted by her husband or lover, composed these affecting lines herself; which here are given from a copy in the Editor's folio MS. compared with another in Allan Ramsay's Miscellany. Balow, my babe, ly stil and sleipe! It grieves me sair to see thee weipe: If thoust be silent, Ile be glad, Thy maining maks my heart ful sad. Balow, my boy, thy mithers joy, Thy father breides me great annoy. Balow, my babe, ly stil and sleipe, It grieves me sair to see thee weepe. Whan he began to court my luve, And with his sugred wordes When sugar was first imported into Europe, it was a very great dainty; and therefore the epithet sugred is used by all our old writers metaphorically to express extreme and delicate sweetness. (See above, p. 176.) Sugar at present is cheap and common; and therefore suggests now a coarse and vulgar idea. to muve, His faynings fals, and flattering cheire To me that time did not appeire: But now I see, most cruell hee Cares neither for my babe nor mee. Balow, &amp;c. Ly stil, my darling, sleipe a while, And whan thou wakest, sweitly smile: But smile not, as thy father did, To cozen maids: nay God forbid! Bot yett I feire, thou wilt gae neire Thy fatheris hart, and face to beire. Balow, &amp;c. I cannae chuse, but ever will Be luving to thy father stil: Whair-eir he gae, whair-eir he ryde, My luve with him maun stil abyde: In weil or wae, whair-eir he gae, Mine hart can neire depart him frae. Balow, &amp;c. Bot doe not, doe not, prettie mine, To faynings fals thine hart incline; Be loyal to thy luver trew, And nevir change hir for a new: If gude or faire, of hir have care, For womens banning's wonderous sair. Balow, &amp;c. Bairne, sin thy cruel father is gane, Thy winsome smiles maun eise my paine; My babe and I'll together live, He'll comfort me whan cares doe grieve: My babe and I right saft will ly, And quite forgeit man's cruelty. Balow, &amp;c. Fareweil, fareweil, thou falsest youth, That evir kist a womans mouth! I wish all maides be warnd by mee Nevir to trust mans curtesy; For if we doe bot chance to bow, They'le use us than they care not how. Balow, my babe, ly stil, and sleipe, It grieves me sair to see thee weipe. XIV. THE MURDER OF THE KING OF SCOTS. The catastrophe of Henry Stewart, lord Daruley, the unfortunate husband of Mary Q. of Scots, is the subject of this ballad. It is here related in that partial imperfect manner, in which such an event would naturally strike the subjects of another kingdom; of which he was a native. Henry appears to have been a vain capricious worthless young man, of weak understanding, and dissolute morals. But the beauty of his person, and the inexperience of his youth, would dispose mankind to treat him with an indulgence, which the cruelty of his murder would afterwards convert into the most tender pity and regret: and then imagination would not fail to adorn his memory with all those virtues, he ought to have possessed. This will account for the extravagant elogium bestowed upon him in the first stanza, &amp;c. Henry lord Darnley was eldest son of the earl of Lennox, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece of Henry VIII. and daughter of Margaret queen of Scotland by the earl of Angus, whom that princess married after the death of James IV.—Darnley, who had been born and educated in England, was but in his 21st year, when he was murdered, Feb. 9. 1567–8. This crime was perpetrated by the E. of Bothwell, not out of respect to the memory of David Riccio, but in order to pave the way for his own marriage with the queen. This ballad (printed from the Editor's folio MS.) seems to have been written soon after Mary's escape into England in 1568, see v. 65.—It will be remembered at v. 5. that this princess was Q. dowager of France, having been first married to Francis II. who died Dec. 4. 1560. Woe worth, woe worth thee, false Scotlànde! For thou hast ever wrought by sleighte; The worthyest prince that ever was borne, You hanged under a cloud by night. The queene of France a letter wrote, And sealed it with harte and ringe; And bade him come Scotland within, And shee wold marry and crowne him kinge. To be a king is a pleasant thing, To be a prince unto a peere: But you have heard, and soe have I, A man may well buy gold too deare. There was an Italyan in that place, Was as well beloved as ever was hee, And David Riccio was his name, Chamberlaine to the queene was hee. If the king had risen forth of his place, Hee wold have sate him downe i'th' chaire, Although it beseemed him not so well, And though the kinge were present there. Some lords in Scotlande waxed wroth, And quarrelled with him for the nonce; And I shall tell how it befell, Twelve daggers were in him att once. When the queene shee saw her chamberlaine slaine, For him her faire cheeks she did weete, And made a vowe for a yeare and a day The king and shee wold not come in one sheete. Then some of the lords they waxed wroth, And made their vow all vehementlye; That for the death of the chamberlaine, How hee, the king himselfe, sholde dye. With gun-powder they strewed his roome, And layd greene rushes in his waye; For the traitors thought that very night This worthye king for to betraye. To bedd the king he made him bowne; To take his rest was his desire; He was noe sooner cast on sleepe, But his chamber was on a blasing fire. Up he lope, and the window brake, And hee had thirtye foote to fall; Lord Bodwell kept a privy watch, All underneath the castle wall. Who have we here? lord Bodwell sayd: Now answer me, that I may know. “King Henry the eighth my uncle was; For his sweete sake some pitty show.” Who have we here? lord Bodwell sayd, Now answer me when I doe speake. “Ah, lord Bodwell, I know thee well; Some pitty on me I pray thee take.” Ile pitty thee as much, he sayd, And as much favour show to thee, As thou didst to the queenes chamberlaine, That day thou deemedst him to die Pronounced after the northern manner dee. Through halls and towers the king they ledd, Through towers and castles that were nye, Through an arbor into an orchàrd, There on a peare-tree hanged him hye. When the governor of Scotland heard, How that the worthye king was slaine; He persued the queen so bitterlye, That in Scotland shee dare not remaine. But she is fledd into merry England, And here her residence hath tane; And through the queene of Englands grace, In England now shee doth remaine. XV. A SONNET BY Q. ELIZABETH. The following lines, if they display no rich vein of poetry are yet so strongly characteristic of their great and spirited authoress, that the insertion of them will be pardoned. They are preserved in Puttenham's Arte of Eng. Poesie; a book in which are many sly addresses to the queen's foible of shining as a poetess. The extraordinary manner in which these verses are introduced, shews what kind of homage was exacted from the courtly writers of those times, viz. “I find, says this antiquated critic, none example in English metre, so well maintaining this figure [Exargasia, or the Gorgeous, Lat. Expolitio] as that dittie of her majesties owne making, passing sweete and harmonicall; which figure beyng as his very originall name purporteth the most bewtifull and gorgious of all others, it asketh in reason to be reserved for a last complement, and desciphred by a ladies penne, herselfe beyng the most bewtifull, or rather bewtie of queenes She was at this time near three-score.. And this was the occasion: our soveraigne lady perceiving how the Scottish queenes residence within this realme at so great libertie and ease (as were skarce meete for so great and dangerous a prysoner) bred secret factions among her people, and made many of the nobilitie incline to favour her partie: some of them desirous of innovation in the state: others aspiring to greater fortunes by her libertie and life. The queene our soveraigne ladie to declare that she was nothing ignorant of those secret practizes, though she had long with great wisdome and pacience dissembled it, writeth this dittie most sweete and sententious, not hiding from all such aspiring minds the danger of their ambition and disloyaltie: which afterwards fell out most truly by th'exemplary chastisement of sundry persons, who in favour of the said Scot. Qu. declining from her majestie, sought to interrupt the quiet of the realme by many evill and undutifull practizes.” This sonnet seems to have been composed in 1569, not long before the D. of Norfolk, the earls of Pembroke and Arundel, the lord Lumley, Sir Nich. Throcmorton, and others, were taken into custody. See Hume, Rapin, &amp;c.—It was originally written in long lines or alexandrines, each of which is here divided into two. The doubt of future foes Exiles my present joy; And wit me warnes to shun such snares, As threaten mine annoy. For falshood now doth flow, And subject faith doth ebbe; Which would not be if reason rul'd, Or wisdome wev'd the webbe. But clowdes of toyes untried Do cloake aspiring mindes; Which turn to raine of late repent, By course of changed windes. The toppe of hope supposed The roote of ruthe wil be; And frutelesse all their graffed guiles, As shortly ye shall see. Then dazeld eyes with pride, Which great ambition blindes, Shal be unseeld by worthy wights, Whose foresight falshood finds. The daughter of debate She evidently means here the Queen of Scots., That eke discord doth sowe, Shal reape no gaine where former rule Hath taught stil peace to growe. No forreine bannisht wight Shall ancre in this port; Our realme it brookes no strangers force, Let them elsewhere resort. Our rusty sworde with rest Shall first his edge employ, Shall ‘quickly’ poll their toppes, that seeke Such change, and gape for joy. I cannot help subjoining to the above sonnet another distich of Elizabeth's preserved by Puttenham (p. 197.) “which (says he) our soveraigne lady wrote in defiance of fortune.” Never thinke you, Fortune can beare the sway, Where Vertue's force can cause her to obay. The slightest effusion of such a mind deserves attention. XVI. KING OF SCOTS AND ANDREW BROWNE. This ballad is a proof of the little intercourse that subsisted between the Scots and English, before the accession of James I. to the crown of England. The tale which is here so circumstantially related does not appear to have had the least foundation in history, but was probably built upon some confused hearsay report of the tumults in Scotland during the minority of that prince, and of the conspiracies formed by different factions to get possession of his person. It should seem from ver. 102. to have been written during the regency, or at least before the death, of the earl of Morton, who was condemned and executed June 2. 1581; when James was in his 15th year. The original copy (preserved in the archives of the Antiquarian Society London) is intitled, “A new Ballad, declaring the great treason conspired against the young king of Scots, and how one Andrew Browne an English-man, which was the king's chamberlaine, prevented the same. To the tune of Milfield, or els to Green-sleeves.” At the end is subjoined the name of the author W. Elderton. “Imprinted at London for Yarathe James, dwelling in Newgate Market, over against Ch. Church,” in black letter, folio. This Elderton, who had been originally an attorney in the sheriffs courts of London, and afterwards (if we may believe Oldys) a comedian, was a facetious fuddling companion, whose tippling and his rhymes rendered him famous among his contemporaries. He was author of many popular songs and ballads; and probably other pieces in these volumes, besides the following, are of his composing. He is believed to have fallen a martyr to his bottle before the year 1592. His epitaph has been recorded by Camden, and translated by Oldys. Hic fitus est sitiens, atque ebrius Eldertonus, Quid dico hic situs est? hic potius sitis est. Dead drunk here Elderton doth lie; Dead as he is, he still is dry: So of him it may well be said, Here he, but not his thirst, is laid. See Stow's Lond. [Guild-hall.]—Biogr. Brit. [Drayton, by Oldys, Note B.] Ath. Ox.—Camden's Remains.—The Exale-tation of Ale, among Beaumont's Poems, 8vo. 1653. ‘Out alas!’ what a griefe is this That princes subjects cannot be true, But still the devill hath some of his, Will play their parts whatsoever ensue; Forgetting what a grievous thing It is to offend the anointed king? Alas for woe, why should it be so, This makes a sorrowful heigh ho. In Scotland is a bonnie kinge, As proper a youth as neede to be, Well given to every happy thing, That can be in a kinge to see: Yet that unluckie country still, Hath people given to craftie will. Alas for woe, &amp;c. On Whitsun eve it so befell, A posset was made to give the king, Whereof his ladie nurse hard tell, And that it was a poysoned thing: She cryed, and called piteouslie; Now help, or els the king shall die! Alas for woe, &amp;c. One Browne, that was an English man, And hard the ladies piteous crye, Out with his sword, and bestir'd him than, Out of the doores in haste to flie; But all the doores were made so fast, Out of a window he got at last. Alas for woe, &amp;c. He met the bishop coming fast, Having the posset in his hande: The sight of Browne made him aghast, Who bad him stoutly staie and stand. With him were two that ranne away, For feare that Browne would make a fray. Alas for woe, &amp;c. Bishop, quoth Browne, what hast thou there? Nothing at all, my friend, sayde he; But a posset to make the king good cheere. Is it so? sayd Browne, that will I see, First I will have thyself begin, Before thou go any further in; Be it weale or woe, it shall be so, This makes a sorrowful heigh ho. The bishop sayde, Browne I doo know, Thou art a young man poore and bare; Livings on thee I will bestowe: Let me go on, take thou no care. No, no, quoth Browne, I will not be A traitour for all Christiantie: Happe well or woe, it shall be so, Drink now with a sorrowful, &amp;c. The bishop dranke, and by and by His belly burst and he fell downe: A just rewarde for his traitery. This was a posset indeed, quoth Brown! He serched the bishop, and found the keyes, To come to the kinge when he did please. Alas for woe, &amp;c. As soon as the king got word of this, He humbly fell uppon his knee, And praysed God that he did misse To tast of that extremity: For that he did perceive and know, His clergie would betray him so: Alas for woe, &amp;c. Alas, he said, unhappie realme, His father was Henry Lord Darnley. His grandfather the old Earl of Lenox, regent of Scotland, and father of Lord Darnley was murdered at Stirling, Sept. 5. 1571. My father and grandfather slaine: My mother banished, O extreame! Unhappy fate, and bitter bayne! And now like treason wrought for me, What more unhappie realme can be! Alas for woe, &amp;c. The king did call his nurse to his grace, And gave her twenty poundes a yeere; And trustie Browne too in like case, He knighted him with gallant geere; And gave him ‘lands and’ livings great, For dooing such a manly feat, As he did showe, to the bishop's woe, Which made, &amp;c. When all this treason done and past, Tooke not effect of traytery; Another treason at the last, They sought against his majestie: How they might make their kinge away, By a privie banket on a daye. Alas for woe, &amp;c. ‘Another time’ to sell the king Beyonde the seas they had decreede: Three noble Earles heard of this thing, And did prevent the same with speede. For a letter came, with such a charme, That they should doo their king no harme: For further woe, if they did soe, Would make a sorrowful heigh hoe. The Earle Mourton told the Douglas then, Take heede you do not offend the king; But shew yourselves like honest men Obediently in every thing: For his godmother Q. Elizabeth. will not see Her noble childe misus'd to be With any woe; for if it be so, She will make, &amp;c. God graunt all subjects may be true, In England, Scotland, every where: That no such daunger may ensue, To put the prince or state in feare: That God the highest king may see Obedience as it ought to be, In wealth or woe, God graunt it be so To avoide the sorrowful heigh ho. XVII. THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY. A Scottish Song. In December 1591, Francis Stewart Earl of Bothwell had made an attempt to seize on the person of his sovereign James VI. but being disappointed, had retired towards the north. The king unadvisedly gave a commission to George Gordon Earl of Huntley, to pursue Bothwell and his followers with fire and sword. Huntley, under cover of executing that commission, took occasion to revenge a private quarrel he had against James Stewart Earl of Murray, a relation of Bothwell's. In the night of Feb. 7. 1592, he beset Murray's house, burnt it to the ground; and slew Murray himself; a young nobleman of the most promising virtues, and the very darling of the people. See Robertson's Hist. The present Lord Murray hath now in his possession a picture of his ancestor naked and covered with wounds, which had been carried about, according to the custom of that age, in order to inflame the populace to revenge his death. If this picture did not flatter, he well deserved the name of the bonny Earl, for he is there represented as a tall and comely personage. It is a tradition in the family, that Gordon of Bucky gave him a wound in the face: Murray half expiring, said, “You hae spilt a better face than your awin.” Upon this, Bucky pointing his dagger at Huntley's breast, swore, “You shall be as deep as I;” and forced him to pierce the poor defenceless body. K. James, who took no care to punish the murtherers, is said by some to have privately countenanced and abetted them, being stimulated by jealousy for some indiscreet praises which his Queen had too lavishly bestowed on this unfortunate youth. See the preface to the next ballad. See also Mr. Walpole's Catalogue of Royal Auth. vol. 1. p. 42. Ye highlands, and ye lawlands, Oh! whair hae ye been? They hae slaine the Earl of Murray, And hae laid him on the green. Now wae be to thee, Huntley! And whairfore did you sae! I bade you bring him wi' you, But forbade you him to slay. He was a braw gallant, And he rid at the ring; And the bonny Earl of Murray, Oh! he might hae been a king. He was a braw gallant, And he playd at the ba'; And the bonny Earl of Murray Was the flower among them a'. He was a braw gallant, And he playd at the gluve; And the bonny Earl of Murray, Oh! he was the Queenes luve. Oh! lang will his lady Luke owre the castle downe Castle downe here has been thought to mean the Castle of Downe, a seat belonging to the family of Murray., Ere she see the Earl of Murray Cum sounding throw the towne. XVIII. YOUNG WATERS. A Sottish Ballad. It has been suggested to the Editor, that this ballad covertly alludes to the indiscreet partiality, which Q. Anne of Denmark is said to have shewn for the bonny Earl of Murray; and which is supposed to have influenced the fate of that unhappy nobleman. Let the Reader judge for himself. The following account of the murder is given by a contemporary writer, and a person of credit, Sir James Balfour, Knight, Lyon King of Arms, whose MS. of the Annals of Scotland is in the Advocates library at Edinburgh. “The seventh of Febry, this zeire, 1592, the Earle of Murray was cruelly murthered by the Earle of Huntley at his house in Dunibrissel in Fysse-shyre, and with him Dunbar, sheriffe of Murray. It was given out and publickly talkt, that the Earle of Huntley was only the instrument of perpetrating this facte, to satisfie the King's jealousie of Murray, quhum the Queene more rashely than wisely, some few days before had commendit in the King's hearing, with too many epithets of a proper and gallant man. The reasons of these surmises proceedit from a proclamatione of the Kings, the 13 of Marche following; inhibiteine the zoung Earle of Murray to persue the Earle of Huntley, for his father's slaughter, in respect he being wardeit [imprisoned] in the castell of Blacknesse for the same murther, was willing to abide a tryall, averring that he had done nothing but by the King's majesties commissione; and was neither airt nor part in the murther This extract is copied from the Critical Review..” The following ballad is here given from a copy printed not long since at Glasgow, in one sheet 8vo. The world was indebted for its publication to the lady Jean Hume, sister to the Earle of Hume, who died lately at Gibraltar. About Zule, quhen the wind blew cule, And the round tables began, A'! there is cum to our kings court Mony a well-favourd man. The queen luikt owre the castle wa, Beheld baith dale and down, And then she saw zoung Waters Cum riding to the town. His footmen they did rin before, His horsemen rade behind, And mantel of the burning gowd Did keip him frae the wind. Gowden graith'd his horse before And siller shod behind, The horse zoung Waters rade upon Was fleeter than the wind. But than spake a wylie lord, Unto the queen said he, O tell me qhua's the fairest face Rides in the company. I've sene lord, and I've sene laird, And knights of high degree; Bot a fairer face than zoung Watèrs Mine eyne did never see. Out then spack the jealous king, (And an angry man was he) O, if he had been twice as fair, Zou micht have excepted me. Zou're neither laird nor lord, she says, Bot the king that wears the crown; Theris not a knight in fair Scotland Bot to thee maun bow down. For a' that she could do or say, Appeasd he wad nae bee; Bot for the words which she had said Zoung Waters he maun dee. They hae taen zoung Waters, and Put fetters to his feet; They hae taen zoung Waters, and Thrown him in dungeon deep. Aft I have ridden thro' Stirling town In the wind bot and the weit; Bot I neir rade thro' Stirling town Wi fetters at my feet. Aft have I ridden thro' Stirling town In the wind bot and the rain; Bot I neir rade thro' Stirling town Neir to return again. They hae taen to the heiding-hill Heiding-hill; i.e. 'heading [beheading] hill. The place of execution was anciently an artificial hillock. His zoung son to his craddle, And they hae taen to the heiding-hill, His horse bot and his saddle. They hae taen to the heiding-hill His lady fair to see. And for the words the Queen had spoke, Zoung Waters he did dee. XIX. MARY AMBREE. In the year 1584, the Spaniards, under the command of Alexander Farnese prince of Parma, began to gain great advantages in Flanders and Brabant, by recovering many strong-holds and cities from the Hollanders, as Ghent, (called then by the English Gaunt,) Antwerp, Mechlin, &amp;c. See Stow's Annals, p. 711. Some attempt made with the assistance of English volunteers to retrieve the former of those places probably gave occasion to this ballad. I can find no mention of our heroine in history, but the following rhymes rendered her famous among our poets. Ben Johnson often mentions her, and calls any remarkable virago by her name. See his Epicæne, first acted in 1609. Act 4. sc. 2. His Tale of a Tub, Act. I. sc. 4. And his masque intitled the Fortunate Isles, 1626, where he quotes the very words of the ballad, —Mary Ambree, (Who marched so free To the siege of Gaunt, And death could not daunt, As the ballad doth vaunt) Were a braver wight, &amp;c. She is also mentioned in Fletcher's Scornful Lady, Act 5. sub finem. —“My large gentlewoman, my Mary Ambree, had I but seen into you, you should have had another bedfellow.”— This ballad is printed from a black-letter copy in the Pepys Collection, improved from the Editor's folio MS. The full title is, “The valorous acts performed at Gaunt by the brave bonnie lass Mary Ambree, who in revenge of her lovers death did play her part most gallantly. The tune is, The blind beggar, &amp;c.” When captaines couragious, whom death colde not daunte, Did march to the siege of the cittye of Gaunte, They mustred their souldiers by two and by three, And formost in battle was Mary Ambree. When brave Sir John Major So MS. Serjeant Major in PC. was slaine in her sight, Who was her true lover, her joy, and delight, Because he was slaine most treacherouslìe, Then vowd to revenge him Mary Ambree. She clothed herselfe from the top to the toe In buffe of the bravest, most seemelye to showe; A faire shirt of male A common phrase in that age for a Coat of Mail. So Spencer speaker of the Irish Gallowglass or Foot-soldier as “armed in a long Shirt of Mayl.” (View of the State of Ireland.) then slipped on shee; Was not this a brave bonny lass, Mary Ambree? A helmett of proofe she strait did provide, A strong arminge sword shee girt by her side, On her hand a goodly faire gauntlett had shee; Was not this a brave bonny lass, Mary Ambree? Then tooke shee her sworde and her targett in hand, Bidding all such as wolde, bee of her band, To wayt on her person came thousand and three: Was not this a brave bonny lass, Mary Ambree? My souldiers so valiant and faithfull, shee sayd, Nowe followe your captaine, no longer a mayd; Still formost in battel myselfe will I bee: Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree? Then cryed out her souldiers, and thus they did say, Soe well thou becomest this gallant array, Thy harte and thy weapons soe well do agree, Noe mayden was ever like Mary Ambree. Shee cheared her souldiers, that foughten for life, With ancyent and standard, with drum and with fife, With brave clanging trumpetts, that sounded so free; Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree? Before I will see the worst of you all To come into danger of death, or of thrall, This hand and this life I will venture so free: Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree? Shee led upp her souldiers in battel arraye, Gainst three times theyr number by breake of the daye; Seven howers in skirmish continued shee: Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree? She filled the skyes with the smoke of her shott, And her enemyes bodyes with bullets soe hott; For one of her owne men a score killed shee: Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree? And when her false gunner, to spoyle her intent, Away all her pellets and powder had spent, Straight with her keen weapon shee slasht him in three: Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree? Being falselye betrayed for lucre of hyre, At length she was forced to make a retyre; Then her souldiers into a strong castle drew shee: Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambre? Her foes they besett her on every side, As thinking close siege shee cold never abide; To beate down her walles they all did decree; But stoutlye deffyd them brave Mary Ambree. Then tooke shee her sword and her targett in hand, And mounting the walls all undaunted did stand, There daring the captaines to match any three: O what a brave captaine was Mary Ambree! Now saye, English captaine, what woldest thou give To ransome thy selfe, which else must not live? Come yield thyselfe quicklye, or slaine thou must bee. Then smiled sweetlye faire Mary Ambree. Ye captaines couragious, of valour so bold, Whom thinke you before you now you doe behold? A knight, sir, of England, and captaine soe free, Who shortelye with us a prisoner must bee. No captaine of England; behold in your sight Two brests in my bosome, and therfore noe knight: Noe knight, sirs, of England, nor captaine you see, But a poor simple mayden, calld Mary Ambree. But art thou a woman, as thou dost declare, Whose valor hath provd so undaunted in warre? If England doth yield such brave maydens as thee, Full well may they conquer, faire Mary Ambree. The prince of Great Parma heard of her renowne, Who long had advanced for Englands faire crowne; Hee wooed her and sued her his mistress to bee, And offerd rich presents to Mary Ambree. But this virtuous mayden despised them all, Ile nere sell my honour for purple nor pall: A mayden of England, sir, never will bee The whore of a monarcke, quoth Mary Ambree. Then to her owne country shee backe did returne, Still holding the foes of faire England in scorne: Therfore English captaines of every degree Sing forth the brave valours of Mary Ambree. XX. BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY. Peregrine Bertie lord Willoughby of Eresby had, in the year 1586, distinguished himself at the siege of Zutphen in the Low Countries. He was the year after made general of the English forces in the United Provinces, in room of the earl of Leicester, who was recalled. This gave him an opportunity of signalizing his courage and military skill in several actions against the Spaniards. One of these, greatly exaggerated by popular report, is probably the subject of this old ballad, which, on account of its flattering encomiums on English valour, hath always been a favourite with the people. “My lord Willoughbie (says a contemporary writer) was one of the queenes best swordsmen: . . . . he was a great master of the art military. . . . . . I have heard it spoken, that had he not slighted the court, but applied himself to the queene, he might have enjoyed a plentifull portion of her grace; and it was his saying, and it did him no good, that he was none of the reptilia; intimating, that he could not creepe on the ground, and that the court was not his element; for indeed, as he was a great souldier, so he was of suitable magnanimitie, and could not brooke the obsequiousnesse and assiduitie of the court.” (Naunton.) Lord Willoughbie died in 1601.—Both Norris and Turner were famous among the military men of that age. The subject of this ballad (which is printed from an old black-letter copy) may possibly receive illustration from what Chapman says in the Dedicat. to his version of Homer's Frogs and Mice, concerning the brave and memorable Retreat of Sir John Norris, with only 1000 men, thro' the whole Spanish army, under the duke of Parma, for three miles together. The fifteenth day of July, With glistering spear and shield, A famous fight in Flanders Was foughten in the field: The most couragious officers Were English captains three; But the bravest man in battel Was brave lord Willoughbèy. The next was captain Norris, A valiant man was hee; The other captain Turner, From field would never flee. With fifteen hundred fighting men, Alas! there were no more, They fought with fourteen thousand then Upon the bloody shore. Stand to it noble pikemen, And look you round about: And shoot you right you bow-men, And we will keep them out: You musquet and callìver men, Do you prove true to me, I'le be the formost man in fight. Says brave lord Willoughbèy. And then the bloody enemy They fiercely did assail, And fought it out most furiously, Not doubting to prevail; The wounded men on both sides fell Most pitious for to see, Yet nothing could the courage quell Of brave lord Willoughbèy For seven hours to all mens view This fight endured sore, Until our men so feeble grew That they could fight no more; And then upon dead horses Full savourly they eat, And drank the puddle water, They could no better get. When they had fed so freely, They kneeled on the ground, And praised God devoutly For the favour they had found; And beating up their colours, The fight they did renew, And turning tow'rds the Spaniard, A thousand more they slew. The sharp steel-pointed arrows, And bullets thick did fly; Then did our valiant soldiers Charge on most furiously; Which made the Spaniards waver, They thought it best to flee, They fear'd the stout behaviour Of brave lord Willoughbèy. Then quoth the Spanish general, Come let us march away, I fear we shall be spoiled all If here we longer stay; For yonder comes lord Willoughbey With courage fierce and fell, He will not give one inch of way For all the devils in hell. And then the fearful enemy Was quickly put to flight, Our men persued couragiously, And caught their forces quite; But at last they gave a shout, Which ecchoed through the sky, God, and St. George for England! The conquerers did cry. This news was brought to England With all the speed might be, And soon our gracious queen was told Of this same victory: O this is brave lord Willoughbey, My love that ever won, Of all the lords of honour 'Tis he great deeds hath done. To th'souldiers that were maimed, And wounded in the fray, The queen allow'd a pension Of fifteen pence a day, And from all costs and charges She quit and set them free, And this she did all for the sake Of brave lord Willoughbèy. Then courage, noble Englishmen, And never be dismaid; If that we but one to ten, We will not be afraid To fight with foraign enemies, And set our nation free: And thus I end the bloody bout Of brave lord Willoughbèy. XXI. VICTORIOUS MEN OF EARTH. This little moral sonnet hath such a pointed application to the heroes of the foregoing and following ballads, that I cannot help placing it here, tho' the date of its composition is of a much later period. It is extracted from “Cupid and Death, a masque by J. S. [James Shirley] presented Mar. 26. 1653. London printed 1653.” 4to. Victorious men of earth, no more Proclaim how wide your empires are; Though you binde in every shore, And your triumphs reach as far As night or day, Yet you proud monarchs must obey, And mingle with forgotten ashes, when Death calls yee to the croud of common men. Devouring famine, plague, and war, Each able to undo mankind, Death's servile emissaries are: Nor to these alone confin'd, He hath at will More quaint and subtle wayes to kill; A smile or kiss, as he will use the art, Shall have the cunning skill to break a heart. XXII. THE WINNING OF CALES. The subject of this ballad is the taking of the city of Cadiz, (called by our sailors corruptly Cales) on June 21. 1596, in a descent made on the coast of Spain, under the command of the Lord Howard admiral, and the Earl of Essex general. The valour of Essex was not more distinguished on this occasion than his generosity: the town was carried sword in hand, but he stopt the slaughter as soon as possible, and treated his prisoners with the greatest humanity, and even affability and kindness. The English made a rich plunder in the city, but miss'd of a much richer, by the resolution which the Duke of Medina the Spanish admiral took, of setting fire to the ships, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. It was computed, that the loss which the Spaniards sustained from this enterprize, amounted to twenty millions of ducats. See Hume's Hist. The Earl of Essex knighted on this occasion not fewer than sixty persons, which gave rise to the following sarcasm, A gentleman of Wales, a knight of Cales, And a laird of the North country; But a yeoman of Kent with his yearly rent Will buy them out all three. The ballad is printed from the Editor's folio MS. and seems to have been composed by some person, who was concerned in the expedition. Most of the circumstances related in it will be found supported by history. Long the proud Spaniards had vaunted their conquests, Threatning our country with fire and sword; Often preparing their navy most sumptuous With as great plenty as Spain could afford. Dub a dub, dub a dub, thus strike their drums; Tantara, tantara, the Englishman comes. To the seas hastily went our lord admiral, With knights couragious and captains full good; The brave Earl of Essex, a prosperous general, With him prepared to pass the salt flood. Dub a dub, &amp;c. At Plymouth speedilye, took they ship valiantlye, Braver ships never were seen under sayle, With their fair colours spread, and streamers o'er their head, Now bragging Spaniard, take heed of your tayle. Dub a dub, &amp;c. Unto Cales cunninglye, came we most speedilye, Where the kinges navy securelye did ride; Being upon their backs, piercing their butts of sacks, Ere any Spaniards our coming descry'd. Dub a dub, &amp;c. Great was the crying, the running and ryding, Which at that season was made in that place; The beacons were fyred, as need then required; To hyde their great treasure they had little space. Dub a dub, &amp;c. There you might see their ships, how they were fyred fast, And how their men drowned themselves in the sea; There might you hear them cry wayle and weep piteously, When they saw no shift to scape thence away. Dub a dub, &amp;c. The great St. Phillip, the pryde of the Spaniards, Was burnt to the bottom, and sunk in the sea; But the St. Andrew, and eke the St. Matthew, Wee took in fight manfullye and brought away. Dub a dub, &amp;c. The Earl of Essex most valiant and hardye, With horsemen and footmen march'd up to the town; The Spanyards, which saw them, were greatly alarmed, Did fly for their safety, and durst not come down. Dub a dub, &amp;c. Now, quoth the noble Earl, courage my soldiers all, Fight and be valiant, the spoil you shall have; And bè well rewarded all from the great to the small; But see the women and children you save. Dub a dub, &amp;c. The Spaniards at that sight, thinking it vain to fight, Hung out flags of truce and yielded the towne; We marched in presentlye, decking the walls on high, With English colours which purchas'd renowne. Dub a dub, &amp;c. Entering the houses then, of the most richest men, For gold and treasure we searched each day; In some places wè did find, pyès baking left behind, Meate at fire rosting, and folk run away. Dub a dub, &amp;c. Full of rych merchandize, every shop catch'd our eyes, Damasks and sattens and velvets full fayre; Whìch soldiers mèasur'd out by the length òf their swords; Of all commodities each had his share. Dub a dub, &amp;c. Thus Cales was taken, and our brave general March'd to the market place, where he did stand; There many prisoneres fell to our several shares, Many crav'd mercye, and mercye they fonde. Dub a dub, &amp;c. When our brave general saw they delayed all, And would not ransome their towne as they said, With their fair wanscots, their presses and bedsteds, Their joint-stools and tables a fire we made; And when the town burned all in a flame, With tara, tantara, away we all came. XXIII. THE SPANISH LADY'S LOVE. This beautiful old ballad most probably took its rise from one of those descents made on the Spanish coasts in the time of queen Elizabeth; and in all likelihood from that which is celebrated in the foregoing ballad. It is printed from an ancient black-letter copy, corrected in part by the Editor's folio MS. Will you hear a Spanish lady, How she wooed an English man? Garments gay as rich as may be Decked with jewels she had on. Of a comely countenance and grace was she, And by birth and parentage of high degree. As his prisoner there he kept her, In his hands her life did lye; Cupid's bands did tye them faster By the liking of an eye. In his courteous company was all her joy, To favour him in any thing she was not coy. But at last there came commandment For to set the ladies free, With their jewels still adorned, None to do them injury. Then said this lady mild, Full woe is me, O let me still sustain this kind captivity! Gallant captain, shew some pity To a ladye in distresse; Leave me not within this city, For to dye in heavinesse: Thou hast set this present day my body free, But my heart in prison still remains with thee. “How should'st thou, fair lady, love me, Whom thou knowst thy countrys foe? Thy fair wordes make me suspect thee: Serpents lie where flowers grow.” All the harm I wishe to thee, most courteous knight, God grant the same upon my head may fully light. Blessed be the time and season, That you came on Spanish ground; If you may our foes be termed, Gentle foes we have you found: With our city, you have won our hearts each one, Then to your country bear away, that is your own. “Rest you still, most gallant lady; Rest you still, and weep no more; Of fair lovers there are plenty, Spain doth yield you wonderous store.” Spaniards fraught with jealousy we oft do find, But Englishmen throughout the world are counted kind. Leave me not unto a Spaniard, Thou alone enjoyst my heart; I am lovely, young, and tender, Love is likewise my desert: Still to serve thee day and night my mind is prest; The wife of every Englishman is counted blest. “It would be a shame, fair lady, For to bear a woman hence; English soldiers never carry And such without offence.” I'll quickly change myself, if it be so, And like a page will follow thee, where'er thou go, “I have neither gold nor silver To maintain thee in this case, And to travel is great charges, As you know in every place.” My chains and jewels every one shall be thy own, And eke 500. MS. tèn thousand pounds in gold that lies unknown. “On the seas are many dangers, Many storms do there arise, Which will be to ladies dreadful, And force tears from watery eyes.” Well in troth I shall endure extremity, For I could find in heart to lose my life for thee. “Courteous ladye, leave this fancy, Here comes all that breeds the strife; I in England have already A sweet woman to my wife; I will not falsify my vow for gold nor gain, Nor yet for all the fairest dames that live in Spain.” O how happy is that woman That enjoys so true a friend! Many happy days God send her; Of my suit I make an end: On my knees I pardon crave for my offence, Which did from love and true affection first commence. Commend me to thy lovely lady, Bear to her this chain of gold; And these bracelets for a token; Grieving that I was so bold: All my jewels in like sort bear thou with thee, For they are fitting for thy wife, but not for me. I will spend my days in prayer, Love and all his laws defye; In a nunnery will I shroud mee Far from any companye: But ere my prayers have an end, be sure of this, To pray for thee and for thy love I will not miss. Thus farewell, most gallant captain! Farewell too my heart's content! Count not Spanish ladies wanton, Though to thee my love was bent: Joy and true prosperity goe still with thee! The like fall ever to thy share, most fair ladìe. XXIV. ARGENTILE AND CURAN —Is extracted from an ancient historical poem in XIII Books, intitled Albion's England by William Warner: “An author (says a former editor) only unhappy in the choice of his subject, and measure of his verse. His poem is an epitome of the British history, and written with great learning, sense, and spirit. In some places fine to an extraordinary degree, as I think will eminently appear in the ensuing episode [of Argentile and Curan]. A tale full of beautiful incidents, in the romantic taste, extremely affecting, rich in ornament, wonderfully various in style; and in short, one of the most beautiful pastorals I ever met with.” [Muses library 8vo. 1738.] To this elogium nothing can be objected, unless perhaps an affected quaintness in some of his expressions, and an indelicacy in some of his pastoral images. Warner is said to have been a Warwickshire man, and to have been educated in Oxford at Magdalene Hall Athen. Oxon.: in the latter part of his life he was retained in the service of Henry Cary lord Hunsdon, to whom he dedicates his poem. More of his history is not known. Tho' now his name is so seldom mentioned, his contemporaries ranked him on a level with Spenser, and called them the Homer and Virgil of their age Ibid.. But Warner rather resembled Ovid, whose Metamorphosis be seems to have taken for his model, having deduced a perpetual poem from the deluge down to the æra of Elizabeth, full of lively digressions and entertaining episodes. And tho' he is sometimes harsh, affected, and obscure, he often displays a most charming and pathetic simplicity: as where he describes Eleanor's harsh treatment of Rosamond: With that she dasht her on the lippes So dyed double red: Hard was the heart that gave the blow, Soft were those lippes that bled. The edition of Albion's England here followed was printed in 4to, 1602; said in the title-page to have been “first penned and published by William Warner, and now revised and newly enlarged by the same author.” The story of Argentile and Curan is I believe the poet's own invention; it is not mentioned in any of our chronicles. It was however so much admired, that not many years after he published it, came out a larger poem on the same subject in stanzas of six lines, intitled, “The most pleasant and delightful historie of Curan a prince of Danske, and the fayre princesse Argentile, daughter and heyre to Adelbright, sometime king of Northumberland, &amp;c. by William Webster. London 1617.” in 8 sheets 4to. An indifferent paraphrase of the following poem. Tho' here subdivided into stanzas, Warner's metre is the old-fashioned alexandrine of 14 syllables. The reader therefore must not expect to find the close of the stanzas consulted in the pauses. The Brutons ‘being’ departed hence Seaven kingdoms here begonne, Where diversly in divers broyles The Saxons lost and wonne. King Edel and king Adelbright In Diria jointly raigne; In loyal concorde during life These kingly friends remaine. When Adelbright should leave his life, To Edel thus he sayes; By those same bondes of happie love, That held us friends alwaies; By our by-parted crowne, of which The moyetie is mine; By God, to whom my soule must passe, And so in time may thine; I pray thee, nay I cònjure thee, To nourish, as thine owne, Thy neece, my daughter Argentile, Till she to age be growne; And then, as thou receivest it, Resigne to her my throne. A promise had for his bequest, The testatòr he dies; But all that Edel undertooke, He afterwards denies. Yet well he ‘fosters for’ a time The damsell that was growne The fairest lady under heaven; Whose beautie being knowne, A many princes seeke her love; But none might her obtaine; For grippell Edel to himselfe Her kingdome sought to gaine; And for that cause from sight of such He did his ward restraine. By chance one Curan, sonne unto A prince in Danske, did see The maid, with whom he fell in love, As much as man might bee. Unhappie youth, what should he doe? His saint was kept in mewe; Nor he, nor any noble-man Admitted to her vewe. One while in melancholy fits He pines himselfe awaye; Anon he thought by force of arms To win her if he maye: And still against the kings restraint Did secretly invay. At length the high controller Love, Whom none may disobay, Imbased him from lordlines Into a kitchen drudge, That so at least of life or death She might become his judge. Accesse so had to see and speake, He did his love bewray, And tells his birth: her answer was, She husbandles would stay. Meane while the king did beate his braines, His booty to atchieve, Nor caring what became of her, So he by her might thrive; At last his resolution was Some pessant should her wive. And (which was working to his wish) He did observe with joye How Curan, whom he thought a drudge, Scapt many an amorous toye. The king, perceiving such his veine, Promotes his vassal still, Lest that the basenesse of the man Should lett, perhaps, his will. Assured therefore of his love, But not suspecting who The lover was, the king himselfe In his behalf did woe. The lady resolute from love, Unkindly takes that he Should barre the noble, and unto So base a match agree: And therefore shifting out of doores, Departed thence by stealth; Preferring povertie before A dangerous life in wealth. When Curan heard of her escape, The anguish in his hart Was more than much, and after her From court he did depart; Forgetfull of himself his birth, His country, friends, and all, And only minding (whom he mist) The foundresse of his thrall. Nor meanes he after to frequent Or court, or stately townes, But solitarily to live Amongst the country grownes. A brace of years he lived thus, Well pleased so to live, And shepherd-like to feed a flocke Himselfe did wholly give. So wasting love, by worke, and want, Grew almost to the waine: But then began a second love, The worser of the twaine. A country wench, a neatherds maid, Where Curan kept his sheepe, Did feed her drove: and now on her Was all the shepherds keepe. He borrowed on the working daies His holy russets oft, And of the bacon's fat, to make His startops blacke and soft. And least his tarbox should offend, He left it at the folde: Sweete growte, or whig, his bottle had, As much as it might holde. A sheeve of bread as browne as nut, And cheese as white as snow, And wildings, or the seasons fruit He did in scrip bestow. And whilst his py-bald curre did sleepe, And sheep-hooke lay him by, On hollow quilles of oten straw He piped melody. But when he spyed her his saint, He wip'd his greasie shooes, And clear'd the drivell from his beard, And thus the shepheard wooes. “I have, sweet wench, a peece of cheese, “As good as tooth may chawe, “And bread and wildings souling well, (And therewithall did drawe His lardrie) and in ‘yeaning’ see in eating. Ed. 1597. 1602. 1612. “Yon crumpling ewe, quoth he, “Did twinne this fall, and twin shouldst thou, “If I might tup with thee. “Thou art too elvish, faith thou art, “Too elvish and too coy: “Am I, I pray thee, beggarly, “That such a flocke enjoy? “I wis I am not: yet that thou “Doest hold me in disdaine “Is brimme abroad, and made a gybe “To all that keepe this plaine. “There be as quaint (at least that thinke “Themselves as quaint) that crave “The match, that thou, I wot not why, “Maist, but mislik'st to have. “How wouldst thou match? (for well I wot, “Thou art a female) I, “I know not her that willingly so Ed. 1597. Her know I not her that. 1602. “With maiden-head would die. “The plowmans labour hath no end, “And he a churle will prove: “The craftsman hath more worke in hand, “Then fitteth unto love: “The merchant, traffiquing abroad, “Suspects his wife at home: “A youth will play the wanton; and “An old man prove a mome. “Then chuse a shepheard: with the sun “He doth his flocke unfold, “And all the day on hill or plaine “He merrie chat can hold; “And with the sun doth folde againe; “Then jogging home betime, “He turnes a crab, or tunes a round, “Or sings some merry ryme. “Nor lacks he gleefull tales, whilst round to tell, whilst round the bole doth trot. Ed. 1597. “The nut-brown bowl doth trot; “And sitteth singing care-away, “Till he to bed be got: “Theare sleepes he soundly all the night, “Forgetting morrow-cares; “Nor feares he blasting of his corne, “Nor uttering of his wares; “Or stormes by seas, or stirres on land, “Or cracke of credit lost: “Not spending franklier than his flocke “Shall still defray the cost. “Well wot I, sooth they say, that say “More quiet nights and daies “The shepheard sleeps and wakes, than he “Whose cattel he doth graize. “Beleeve me, lasse, a king is but “A man, and so am I: “Content is worth a monarchie, “And mischiefs hit the hie; “As late it did a king and his “Not dwelling far from hence, “Who left a daughter, save thyselfe, “For fair a matchless wench.”— Here did he pause, as if his tongue Had done his heart offence. The neatresse, longing for the rest, Did egge him on to tell How faire she was, and who she was. “She bore, quoth he, the bell “For beautie: though I clownish am, “I know what beautie is; “Or did I not, at seeing thee, “I senceles were to mis. “Her stature comely, tall; her gate “Well graced; and her wit “To marvell at, not meddle with, “As matchless I omit. “A globe-like head, a gold-like haire, “A forehead smooth, and hie, “An even nose; on either side “Did shine a grayish eie: “Two rosie cheekes, round ruddy lips, “White just-set teeth within; “A mouth in meane; and underneathe “A round and dimpled chin. “Her snowie necke, with blewish veines, “Stood bolt upright upon “Her portly shoulders: beating balles “Her veined breasts, anon “Adde more to beautie.

Ed. 1597. 1602. 1612. Coote.. Credit me, Thy latter speech bewraies Thy clownish shape a coined shew. But wherefore dost thou weepe? The shepheard wept, and she was woe, And both doe silence keepe. “In troth, quoth he, I am not such, “As seeming I professe: “But then for her, and now for thee, “I from myselfe digresse. “Her loved I (wretch that I am “A recreant to be) “I loved her, that hated love, “But now I die for thee. “At Kirkland is my fathers court, “And Curan is my name, “In Edels court sometimes in pompe, “Till love contrould the same: “But now—what now?—deare heart, how now? “What ailest thou to weepe?” The damsell wept, and he was woe, And both did silence keepe. I graunt, quoth she, it was too much That you did love so much: But whom your former could not move, Your second love doth touch. Thy twice-beloved Argentile Submitteth her to thee, And for thy double love presents Herself a single fee, In passion not in person chaung'd, And I, my lord, am she. They sweetly surfeiting in joy, And silent for a space, When as the extasie had end, Did tenderly imbrace; And for their wedding, and their wish Got fitting time and place.

XXV. CORIN'S FATE. Only the three first stanzas of this song are ancient; these are extracted from the quarto MS. mentioned in vol. I. p. 66. As they seemed to want application, this has been attempted by a modern hand. Corin, most unhappie swaine, Whither wilt thou drive thy flocke? Little foode is on the plaine; Full of danger is the rocke: Wolfes and beares doe kepe the woodes; Forests tangled are with brakes: Meadowes subject are to floodes; Moores are full of miry lakes. Yet to shun all plaine, and hill, Forest, moore, and meadow-ground, Hunger will as surely kill: How may then reliefe be found? Such is hapless Corins fate: Since my waywarde love begunne, Equall doubts begett debate What to seeke, and what to shunne. Spare to speke, and spare to speed; Yet to speke will move disdaine: If I see her not I bleed, Yet her sight augments my paine. What may then poor Corin doe? Tell me, shepherdes, quicklye tell; For to linger thus in woe Is the lover's sharpest hell. XXVI. JANE SHORE. Tho' so many vulgar errors have prevailed concerning this celebrated courtezan, no charactér in history has been more perfectly handed dewn to us. We have her portrait drawn by two masterly pens; the one has delineated the features of her person, the other those of her character and story. Sir Thomas More drew from the life, and Drayton has copied an original picture of her. The reader will pardon the length of the quotations, as they serve to correct many popular mistakes relating to her catastrophe. The first is from Sir Thomas More's history of Rich. III. written in 1513, about thirty years after the death of Edw. IV. “Now then by and by, as it wer for anger, not for covetise, the protector sent into the house of Shores wife (for her husband dwelled not with her) and spoiled her of al that ever she had, (above the value of 2 or 3 thousand marks) and sent her body to prison. And when he had a while laide unto her, for the maner sake, that she went about to bewitch him, and that she was of counsel with the lord chamberlein to destroy him: in conclusion when that no colour could fasten upon these matters, then he layd heinously to her charge the thing that herselfe could not deny, that al the world wist was true, and that natheles every man laughed at to here it then so sodainly so highly taken,—that she was naught of her body. And for thys cause (as a goodly continent prince, clene and fautles of himself, sent oute of heaven into this vicious wórld for the amendment of mens maners) he caused the bishop of London to put her to open penance, going before the crosse in procession upon a sonday with a taper in her hand. In which she went in countenance and pace demure so womanly; and albeit she was out of al array save her kyrtle only, yet went she so fair and lovely, namelye, while the wondering of the people caste a comly rud in her chekes (of which she before had most misse) that her great shame wan her much praise among those that were more amorous of her body, then curious of her soule. And many good folke also, that hated her living, and glad wer to se sin corrected, yet pittied thei more her penance then rejoiced therin, when thei considred that the protector procured it more of a corrupt intent, then any virtuous affeccion. “This woman was born in London, worshipfully frended, honestly brought up, and very wel maryed, saving somewhat to soone; her husbande an honest citizen, yonge, and goodly, and of good substance. But for as muche as they were coupled ere she wer wel ripe, she not very fervently loved, for whom she never longed. Which was happely the thinge, that the more easily made her encline unto the king's appetite, when he required her. Howbeit the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gay apparel, ease, plesure, and other wanton welth, was able soane to perse a soft tender hearte. But when the king had abused her, anon her husband (as he was an honest man, and one that could his good, not presuming to touch a kinges concubine) left her up to him al together. When the king died, the lord chamberlen [Hastings] toke her After the death of Hastings, she was kept by the marquis of Dorset, son to Edward IV's queen. In Rymer's Fœdera is a proclamation of Richard's, dated at Leicester, Oct. 23. 1483. wherein a reward of 1000 marks in money, or 100 a year in land is offered for taking “Thomas late marquis of Dorset,” who “not having the fear of God, nor the salvation of his own soul, before his eyes, has damnably debauched and defiled many maids, widows, and wives, and lived in actual adultery with the wife of Shore.” Buckingham was at that time in rebellion, but as Dorset was not with him, Richard could not accuse him of treason, and therefore made a handle of these pretended debaucheries to get him apprehended. Vide Rym. Fæd. tom. xij. pag. 204.: which in the kinges daies, albeit he was sore enamoured upon her, yet he forbare her, either for reverence, or for a certain frendly faithfulness. “Proper she was, and faire: nothing in her body that you wold have changed, but if you would have wished her somewhat higher. Thus say thei that knew her in her youthe. Albeit some that now see her (for yet she liveth) deme her never to have bene wel visaged. Whose jugement seemeth me somewhat like, as though men should gesse the bewty of one longe before departed, by her scalpe taken out of the charnel-house; for now is she old, lene, withered, and dried up, nothing left but ryvilde skin, and hard bone. And yet being even such, whose wel advise her visage, might gesse and devise which partes how filled, wold make it a faire face. “Yet delited not men so much in her bewty, as in her pleasant behaviour. For a proper wit had she, and could both rede wel and write; mery in company, redy and quick of aunswer, neither mute nor ful of bable; sometime taunting without displeasure, and not without disport. The king would say, That he had three concubines, which in three divers properties diversly excelled. One the meriest, another the wiliest, the thirde the holiest harlot in his realme, as one whom no man could get out of the church lightly to any place, but it wer to his bed. The other two wer somwhat greater personages, and natheles of their humilite content to be nameles, and to forbere the praise of those properties; but the meriest was the Shoris wife, in whom the king therfore toke special pleasure. For many he had, but her he loved, whose favour, to sai the trouth (for sinne it wer to belie the devil) she never abused to any mans hurt, but to many a mans comfort and relief. Where the king toke displeasure, she would mitigate and appease his mind: where men were out of favour, she wold bring them in his grace: for many, that had highly offended, shee obtained pardon: of great forfeitures she gate men remission: and finally in many weighty sutes she stode many men in gret stede, either for none or very smal rewardes, and those rather gay than rich: either for that she was content with the dede selfe well done, or for that she delited to be sued unto, and to show what she was able to do wyth the king, or for that wanton women and welthy be not alway covetous. “I doubt not some shal think this woman too sleight a thing to be written of, and set amonge the remembraunces of great matters: which thei shal specially think, that happely shal esteme her only by that thei now see her. But me semeth the chaunce so much the more worthy to be remembred, in how much she is now in the more beggerly condicion, unfrended and worne out of acquaintance, after good substance, after as grete favour with the prince, after as grete sute and seeking to with al those, that in those days had busynes to spede, as many other men were in their times, which be now famouse only by the infamy of their il dedes. Her doinges were not much lesse, albeit thei be muche lesse remembred because thei were not so evil. For men use, if they have an evil turne, to write it in marble; and whoso doth us a good tourne, we write it in duste These words of Sir Thomas More probably suggested to Shakespeare that proverbial reflection, in Hen. viij. Act. 4. sc. 11. “Men's evill manners live in brass: their virtues “We write in water.” Shakesp. in his play of Rich. III. follows More's Hist. of that reign, and therefore could not but see this passage.. Which is not worst proved by her; for at this daye shee beggeth of many at this daye living, that at this day had begged, if shee had not bene.” See More's workes, folio, bl. let. 1557. pag. 56. 57. Drayton has written a poetical epistle from this lady to her royal lover, in his notes on which he thus draws her portrait. “Her stature was meane, her haire of a dark yellow, her face round and full, her eye gray, delicate harmony being betwixt each part's proportion, and each proportion's colour, her body fat, white and smooth, her countenance cheerfull and like to her condition. The picture which I have seen of hers was such as she rose out of her bed in the morning, having nothing on but a rich mantle cast under one arme over her shoulder, and sitting on a chaire, on which her naked arm did lie. What her father's name was, or where she was borne, is not certainly knowne: but Shore a young man of right goodly person, wealth and behaviour, abandoned her bed after the king had made her his concubine. Richard III. causing her to do open penance in Paul's church-yard, commanded that no man should relieve her, which the tyrant did not so much for his hatred to sinne, but that by making his brother's life odious, he might cover his horrible treasons the more cunningly.” See England's Heroical epistles, by Mich. Drayton, Esq; Lond. 1637. 12mo. The following ballad is printed from an old black letter copy in the Pepys collection. Its full title is, “The woefull lamentation of Jane Shore, a goldsmith's wife in London, sometime king Edward IV. his concubine. To the tune of Live with me, &amp;c [See the first volume.] To every stanza is annexed the following burthen: Then maids and wives in time amend, For love and beauty will have end. If Rosamonde that was so faire, Had cause her sorrowes to declare, Then let Jane Shore with sorrowe sing, That was beloved of a king. In maiden yeares my beautye bright Was loved dear of lord and knight; But yet the love that they requir'd, It was not as my friends desir'd. My parents they, for thirst of gaine, A husband for me did obtaine; And I, their pleasure to fulfille, Was forc'd to wedd against my wille. To Matthew Shore I was a wife, Till lust brought ruine to my life; And then my life I lewdlye spent, Which makes my soul for to lament. In Lombard-street I once did dwelle, As London yet can witness welle; Where many gallants did beholde My beautye in a shop of golde. I spred my plumes, as wantons doe, Some sweet and secret friende to wooe, Because chast love I did not finde Agreeing to my wanton minde. At last my name in court did ring Into the eares of Englandes king, Who came and lik'd, and love requir'd, But I made coye what he desir'd: Yet Mistress Blague, a neighbour neare, Whose friendship I esteemed deare, Did saye, It was a gallant thing To be beloved of a king. By her persuasions I was led, For to defile my marriage-bed, And wronge my wedded husband Shore, Whom I had married yeares before. In heart and mind I did rejoyce, That I had made so sweet a choice; And therefore did my state resigne, To be king Edward's concubine. From city then to court I went, To reape the pleasures of content; There had the joyes that love could bring, And knew the secrets of a king. When I was thus advanc'd on highe Commanding Edward with mine eye, For Mrs. Blague I in short space Obtainde a livinge from his grace. No friende I had but in short time I made unto promotion climbe; But yet for all this costlye pride, My husbande could not mee abide. His bed, though wronged by a king, His heart with deadlye griefe did sting; From England then he goes away To end his life beyond the sea. He could not live to see his name Impaired by my wanton shame; Although a prince of peerlesse might Did reape the pleasure of his right. Long time I lived in the courte, With lords and ladies of great sorte; And when I smil'd all men were glad, But when I frown'd my prince grewe sad. But yet a gentle minde I bore To helplesse people, that were poore; I still redrest the orphans crye, And sav'd their lives condemnd to dye. I still had ruth on widowes tears, I succour'd babes of tender yeares; And never look'd for other gaine But love and thankes for all my paine. At last my royall king did dye, And then my dayes of woe grew nighe; When crook-back Richard got the crowne, King Edwards friends were soon put downe. I then was punisht for my sin, That I so long had lived in; Yea, every one that was his friend, This tyrant brought to shamefull end. Then for my lewd and wanton life, That made a strumpet of a wife, I penance did in Lombard-street, In shamefull manner in a sheet. Where many thousands did me viewe, Who late in court my credit knewe; Which made the teares run down my face, To thinke upon my foul disgrace. Not thus content, they took from mee My goodes, my livings, and my fee, And charg'd that none should me relieve, Nor any succour to me give. Then unto Mrs. Blague I went, To whom my jewels I had sent, In hope therebye to ease my want, When riches fail'd, and love grew scant: But she denyed to me the same When in my need for them I came; To recompence my former love, Out of her doores shee did me shove. So love did vanish with my state, Which now my soul repents too late; Therefore example take by mee, For friendship parts in povertìe. But yet one friend among the rest, Whom I before had seen distrest, And sav'd his life, condemn'd to die, Did give me food to succour me: For which, by lawe, it was decreed That he was hanged for that deed; His death did grieve me so much more, Than had I dyed myself therefore. Then those to whom I had done good, Durst not afford mee any food; Whereby I begged all the day, And still in streets by night I lay. My gowns beset with pearl and gold, Were turn'd to simple garments old; My chains and gems and golden rings, To filthy rags and loathsome things. Thus was I scorn'd of maid and wife, For leading such a wicked life; Both sucking babes and children small, Did make their pastime at my fall. I could not get one bit of bread, Whereby my hunger might be sed: Nor drink, but such as channels yield, Or stinking ditches in the field. Thus, weary of my life, at lengthe I yielded up my vital strength Within a ditch of loathsome scent, Where carrion dogs did much frequent: The which now since my dying daye, Is Shoreditch call'd, as writers saye But it had this name long before; being so called from its being a common SEWER (vulgarly SHORE) or drain. See Stow., Which is a witness of my sinne, For being concubine to a king. You wanton wives, that fall to lust, Be you assur'd that God is just; Whoredome shall not escape his hand, Nor pride unpunish'd in this land. If God to me such shame did bring, That yielded only to a king, How shall they scape that daily run To practise sin with every one? You husbands, match not but for love, Lest some disliking after prove; Women, be warn'd when you are wives, What plagues are due to sinful lives: Then, maids and wives, in time amend, For love and beauty will have end. XXVII. CORYDON'S DOLEFUL KNELL. This little simple elegy is given, with some corrections, from two copies, one of which is in “The golden garland of princely delights.” The burthen of the song, Ding Dong, &amp;c. is at present appropriated to burlesque subjects, and therefore may excite only ludicrous ideas in a modern reader; but in the time of our poet it usually accompanied the most solemn and mournful strains. Of this kind is that fine aerial Dirge in Shakespear's Tempest, “Full fadom five thy father lies, “Of his bones are corrall made; “Those are pearles that were his eyes; “Nothing of him, that doth fade, “But doth suffer a sea-change “Into something rich and strange: “Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell, “Harke now I heare them, Ding dong bell.” [“Burthen, Ding dong.”] I make no doubt but the poet intended to conclude this air in a manner the most solemn and expressive of melancholy. My Phillida, adieu love! For evermore farewel! Ay me! I've lost my true love, And thus I ring her knell, Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, My Phillida is dead! I'll stick a branch of willow At my fair Phillis' head. For my fair Phillida Our bridal bed was made: But 'stead of silkes so gay, She in her shroud is laid. Ding, &amp;c. Her corpse shall be attended By maides in fair array, Till th'obsequies are ended, And she is wrapt in clay. Ding, &amp;c. Her herse it shall be carried By youths, that do excell: And when that she is buried, I thus will ring her knell, Ding, &amp;c. A garland shall be framed By art and natures skill, Of sundry-colour'd flowers, In token of good-will It is a custom in many parts of England, to carry a fine garland before the corpse of a woman who dies unmarried.: Ding, &amp;c. And sundry-colour'd ribbands On it I will bestow; But chiefly black and yellowe See above, page 175. With her to grave shall go. Ding, &amp;c. I'll decke her tomb with flowers, The rarest ever seen And with my tears, as showers, I'll keepe them fresh and green. Ding, &amp;c. Instead of fairest colours, Set forth with curious art This alludes to the painted effiges of Alabaster, anciently erected upon tombs aad monuments., Her image shall be painted On my distressed heart. Ding, &amp;c. ‘And thereon shall be graven Her epitaph so faire, “Here lies the loveliest maiden, “That e'er gave shepheard care. Ding, &amp;c. In sable will I mourne; Blacke shall be all my weede, Ay me! I am forlorne. Now Phillida is dead. Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, My Phillida is dead! I'll stick a branch of willow At my fair Phillis' head. THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. I. THE COMPLAINT OF CONSCIENCE. I shall begin this Third Book with an old allegoric Satire: A manner of moralizing, which, if it was not first introduced by the author of Pierce Plowman's Visions, was at least chiefly brought into repute by that ancient satirist. It is not so generally known that the kind of verse used in this ballad hath any affinity with the peculiar metre of that writer. The following Song intitled The Complaint of Conscience, is printed from the Editor's folio Manuscript: Some corruptions in the old Copy are here corrected; but not without notice to the Reader, where it was necessary, by inclosing the corrections between inverted ‘Commas.’ As I walked of late by an wood side, To God for to meditate was mine entent; Where under an hawthorne I suddenlye spyed A silly poore creature ragged and rent, With bloody teares his face was besprent, His sleshe and his color consumed away, And his garments they were all mire, mucke, and clay. This made me muse, and much ‘to’ desire To know what kind of man hee shold bee; I stept to him straight, and did him require His name and his secretts to shew unto mee. His head he cast up, and wooful was hee, My name, quoth he, is the cause of my care, And makes me scorned, and left here so bare. Then straightway he turnd him, and prayd me sit downe, And I will, saithe he, declare my whole greefe; My name is called, Conscience:—wheratt he did frowne, He repined to repeate it, and grinded his teethe, ‘Thoughe now, silly wretche, I'm denyed all releef,’ ‘Yet’ while I was young, and tender of yeeres, I was entertained with kinges, and with peeres. There was none in the court that lived in such fame, For with the kinges councell I sate in commission; Dukes, earles, and barons esteem'd of my name; And how that I liv'd there, needs no repetition: I was ever holden in honest condition, For how-e'er the lawes went in Westminster-hall, When sentence was given, for me they wold call. No incomes at all the landlords wold take, But one pore peny, that was their fine; And that they acknowledged to be for my sake. The poore wold doe nothing without councell mine: I ruled the world with the right line: For nothing ‘ere’ passed betweene foe and friend, But Conscience was called to bee at the end. Noe bargaine, nor merchandize merchants wold make But I was called a witnesse therto: No use for noe money, nor forfett wold take, But I wold controule them, if that they did soe: ‘And’ that makes me live now in great woe, For then came in Pride, Sathan's disciple, That is now entertained with all kind of people. He brought with him three, whose names ‘thus they call’ That is Covetousnes, Lecherye, Usury, beside: They never prevail'd, till they wrought my downe-fall; Soe Pride was entertained, but Conscience decried, And ‘now ever since’ abroad have I tryed To have had entertainment with some one or other; But I am rejected, and scorned of my brother. Then went I to Court the gallants to winne, But the porter kept me out of the gate: To Bartlemew Spittle to pray for my sinne, They bade me goe packe, itt was fit for my state; Goe, goe, thread-bare Conscience, and seeke thee a mate. Good Lord, long preserve my king, prince, and queene, With whom I ever esteemed have been. Then went I to London, where once I did ‘dwell’: But they bade away with me, when they knew my name; For he will undoe us to bye and to sell! They bade me goe packe me, and hye me for shame; They laught at my raggs, and there had good game; This is old thread-bare Conscience, that dwelt with saint Peter: But they wold not admitt me to be a chimney-sweeper. Not one wold receive me, the Lord he doth know; I having but one poor pennye in my purse, On an awle and some patches I did it bestow; For I thought better cobble shoes than to doe worse: Straight then all the coblers began for to curse, And by statute wold prove me a rogue, and forlorne, And whipp me out of towne to seeke where I was borne. Then did I remember, and call to my minde, The Court of Conscience where once I did sit, Not doubting but there I favor shold find, Sith my name and the place agreed soe fit; But sure of my purpose I fayled a whit, For ‘thoughe’ the judge us'd my name in every commission, The lawyers with their quillets wold get my dismission. Then Westminster-hall was no place for me; Good lord! how the Lawyers began to assemble, And fearfull they were, lest there I shold bee! The silly poore clarkes began for to tremble; I showed them my cause, and did not dissemble; Soe they gave me some money my charges to beare, But swore me on a booke I must never come there. Next the Merchants said, Counterfeite, get thee away, Dost thou remember how we thee fond? We banisht thee the country beyond the salt sea, And sett thee on shore in the New-found land; And there thou and wee most friendly shook hand, And we were right glad when thou didst refuse us; For when we wold reape here thou woldst accuse us. Then had I noe way, but for to go on To Gentlemens houses of an ancyent name; Declaring my greeffes, and there I made moane, Telling how their forefathers held me in fame: And at letting their farmes ‘how always I came’. They sayd, Fye upon thee! we may thee curse: Theire leases continue, and we fare the worse. And then I was forced a begging to goe To husbandmens houses, who greeved right sore, And sware that their landlords had plagued them soe, Thet they were not able to keepe open dore, Nor nothing had left to give to the poore: Therefore to this wood I doe me repayre, Where hepps and hawes, it is my best fare. Yet within this same desert some comfort I have Of Mercye, of Pittye, and of Almes-deeds; Who have vowed to company me to my grave. We are all put to silence, and live upon weeds, ‘And hence such cold house-keeping proceeds’: Our banishment is its utter decay, The which the riche glutton will answer one day. Why then, I said to him, me-thinks it were best To goe to the Clergie; for daylie they preach Eche man to love you above all the rest; Of Mercye and Pittye and Almes-deeds they teache. O, said he, noe matter a pin what they preache, For their wives and their children soe hange them upon, That whosoever gives alms they will We ought in justice and truth to read ‘can’. give none. Then laid he him down, and turned him away, And prayd me to goe, and leave him to rest. I told him, I haplie might yet see the day For him and his fellowes to live with the best. First, said he, banish Pride, then England were blest; For then those wold love us, that now sell their land, And then good house-keeping wold revive out of hand. II. PLAIN TRUTH, AND BLIND IGNORANCE. This excellent old ballad is preserved in the little ancient miscellany intitled, “The Garland of Goodwill.”—Ignorance is here made to speak in the broad Somersetshire dialect. The scene we may suppose to be Glastonbury Abbey. Truth. God speed you, ancient father, And give you a good daye; What is the cause, I praye you, So sadly here you staye? And that you keep such gazing On this decayed place, The which, for superstition, Good princes down did raze? Ignorance. Chill tell thee, by my vazen, That zometimes che have knowne A vair and goodly abbey Stand here of bricke and stone; And many a holy vrier, As ich may say to thee, Within these goodly cloysters Che did full often zee. Truth. Then I must tell thee, father, In truthe and veritiè, A sorte of greater hypocrites Thou couldst not likely see; Deceiving of the simple With false and feigned lies: But such an order truly Christ never did devise. Ignorance. Ah! ah! che zmell thee now, man; Che know well what thou art; A vellow of mean learning, Thee was not worth a vart: Vor when we had the old lawe, A merry world was then; And every thing was plenty Among all zorts of men. Truth. Thou givest me an answer, As did the Jewes sometimes Unto the prophet Jeremye, When he accus'd their crimes: 'Twas merry, sayd the people, And joyfull in our rea'me, When we did offer spice-cakes Unto the queen of heav'n. Ignorance. Chill tell thee what, good vellowe, Before the vriers went hence, A bushell of the best wheate Was zold vor vourteen pence; And vorty egges a penny, That were both good and newe; And this che zay my zelf have zeene, And yet ich am no Jewe. Truth. Within the sacred bible We find it written plain, The latter days should troublesome And dangerous be, certaine; That we should be self-lovers, And charity wax colde; Then 'tis not true religion That makes thee grief to holde. Ignorance. Chill tell thee my opinion plaine, And choul'd that well ye knewe, Ich care not for the bible booke; Tis too big to be true. Our blessed ladyes psalter Zhall for my money goe; Zuch pretty prayers, as there bee, The bible cannot zhowe. Truth. Nowe hast thou spoken trulye, For in that book indeede No mention of our lady, Or Romish saint we read: For by the blessed Spirit That book indited was, And not by simple persons, As was the foolish masse. Ignorance. Cham zure they were not voolishe That made the masse, che trowe: Why, man, 'tis all in Latine, And vools no Latine knowe. Were not our fathers wise men, And they did like it well; Who very much rejoyced To heare the zacring bell? Truth. But many kinges and prophets, As I may say to thee, Have wisht the light that you have, And could it never see: For what art thou the better A Latin song to heare, And understandest nothing. That they sing in the quiere? Ignorance. O hold thy peace, che pray thee, The noise was passing trim To heare the vriers zinging, As we did enter in: And then to zee the rood-loft Zo bravely zet with zaints;— But now to zee them wandring My heart with zorrow vaints. Truth. The Lord did give commandment, No image thou shouldst make, Nor that unto idolatry You should your self betake: The golden calf of Israel Moses did therefore spoile; And Baal's priests and temple Were brought to utter foile. Ignorance. But our lady of Walsinghame Was a pure and holy zaint, And many men in pilgrimage Did shew to her complaint; Yea with zweet Thomas Becket, And many other moe; The holy maid of Kent By name Eliz. Barton, executed Ap. 21. 1534. Stow, p. 570. likewise Did many wonders zhowe. Truth. Such saints are well agreeing To your profession sure; And to the men that made them So precious and so pure; The one for being a traytoure, Met an untimely death; The other eke for treason Did end her hateful breath. Ignorance. Yea, yea, it is no matter, Dispraise them how you wille: But zure they did much goodnesse; Would they were with us stille! We had our holy water, And holy bread likewise, And many holy reliques We zaw before our eyes. Truth. And all this while they fed you With vain and empty showe, Which never Christ commanded, As learned doctors knowe: Search then the holy scriptures, And thou shalt plainly see That headlong to damnation They alway trained thee. Ignorance. If it be true, good vellowe, As thou dost zay to mee, Unto my heavenly fader Alone then will I flee: Believing in the Gospel, And passion of his zon, And with the zubtil papistes Ich have for ever done. III. THE WANDERING JEW. The story of the Wandering Jew is of considerable antiquity: it had obtained full credit in this part of the world before the year 1228, as we learn from Mat. Paris. For in that year, it seems, there came an Armenian archbishop into England, to visit the shrines and reliques preserved in our churches; who being entertained at the monastery of St. Albans, was asked several questions relating to his country, &amp;c. Among the rest a monk, who sat near him, inquired “if he had ever seen or heard of the famous person named Joseph, that was so much talked of; who was present at our Lord's crucifixion and conversed with him, and who was still alive in confirmation of the Christian faith.” The archbishop answered, That the fact was true. And afterwards one of his train, who was well known to a servant of the abbot's, interpreting his master's words, told them in French, “That his lord knew the person they spoke of very well: that he had dined at his table but a little while before he left the East: that he had been Pontius Pilate's porter, by name Cartaphilus; who, when they were dragging Jesus out of the door of the Judgment-hall, struck him with his fist on the back, saying, “Go faster, Jesus, go faster; why dost thou linger?” Upon which Jesus looked at him with a frown and said, “I indeed am going, but thou shalt tarry till I come.” Soon after he was converted, and baptized by the name of Joseph. He lives for ever, but at the end of every hundred years falls into an incurable illness, and at length into a fit or ecstasy, out of which when he recovers, he returns to the same state of youth he was in when Jesus suffered, being then about 30 years of age. He remembers all the circumstances of the death and resurrection of Christ, the saints that arose with him, the composing of the apostles creed, their preaching, and dispersion; and is himself a very grave and holy person.” This is the substance of Matthew Paris's account, who was himself a monk of St. Albans, and was living at the time when this Armenian archbishop made the above relation. Since his time several impostors have appeared at intervals under the name and character of the Wandering Jew; whose several histories may be seen in Calmet's dictionary of the Bible. See also the Turkish Spy, Vol. 2. Book 3. Let. 1. The story that is copied in the following ballad is of one, who appeared at Hamburgh in 1547, and pretended he had been a Jewish shoemaker at the time of Christ's crucifixion.—The ballad however seems to be of later date. It is printed from a black-letter copy in the Pepys collection. When as in faire Jerusalem Our Saviour Christ did live, And for the sins of all the worlde His own deare life did give; The wicked Jewes with scoffes and scornes Did dailye him molest, That never till he left his life, Our Saviour could not rest. When they had crown'd his head with thornes, And scourg'd him to disgrace, In scornfull sort they led him forthe Unto his dying place; Where thousand thousands in the streete Beheld him passe along, Yet not one gentle heart was there, That pityed this his wrong. Both old and young reviled him, As in the streete he wente, And nought he found but churlish tauntes, By every ones consente: His owne deare crosse he bore himselfe, A burthen far too great, Which made him in the street to fainte, With blood and water sweat. Being weary thus, he sought for rest, To ease his burthened soule, Upon a stone; the which a wretch Did churlishly controule; And sayd, Awaye, thou king of Jewes, Thou shalt not rest thee here; Pass on; thy execution place Thou seest nowe draweth neare. And thereupon he thrust him thence; At which our Saviour sayd, I sure will rest, but thou shalt walke, And have no journey stayed. With that this cursed shoemaker, For offering Christ this wrong, Left wife and children, house and all, And went from thence along. Where after he had seene the bloude Of Jesus Christ thus shed, And to the crosse his bodye nail'd, Awaye with speed he fled Without returning backe againe Unto his dwelling place, And wandred up and downe the worlde, A runnagate most base. No resting could he finde at all, No ease, nor hearts content; No house, nor home, nor biding place: But wandring forth he went From towne to towne in foreigne landes, With grieved conscience still, Repenting for the heinous guilt Of his fore-passed ill. Thus after some fewe ages past In wandring up and downe; He much again desired to see Jerusalems renowne, But finding it all quite destroyd, He wandred thence with woe, Our Saviours wordes, which he had spoke, To verefie and showe. “I'll rest, sayd hee, but thou shalt walke,” So doth this wandring Jew From place to place, but cannot rest For seeing countries newe; Declaring still the power of him, Whereas he comes or goes, And of all things done in the east, Since Christ his death, he showes. The world he hath still compast round And seene those nations strange, That hearing of the name of Christ, Their idol gods doe change: To whom he hath told wondrous thinges Of time forepast, and gone, And to the princes of the worlde Declares his cause of moane: Desiring still to be dissolv'd, And yeild his mortal breath; But, if the Lord hath thus decreed, He shall not yet see death. For neither lookes he old nor young, But as he did those times, When Christ did suffer on the crosse For mortall sinners crimes. He hath past through many a foreigne place, Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Grecia, Syria, and great Thrace, And throughout all Hungaria: Where Paul and Peter preached Christ, Those blest apostles deare; There he hath told our Saviours wordes, In countries far, and neare. And lately in Bohemia, With many a German towne; And now in Flanders, as tis thought, He wandreth up and downe: Where learned men with him conferre Of those his lingering dayes, And wonder much to heare him tell His journeyes, and his wayes. If people give this Jew an almes, The most that he will take Is not above a groat a time; Which he, for Jesus' sake, Will kindlye give unto the poore, And thereof make no spare, Affirming still that Jesus Christ Of him hath dailye care. He ne'er was seene to laugh nor smile, But weepe and make great moane; Lamenting still his miseries, And dayes forepast and gone: If he heare any one blaspheme, Or take God's name in vaine, He telles them that they crucifie Their Saviour Christe againe. If you had seene his death, saith he, As these mine eyes have done, Ten thousand thousand times would yee His torments think upon: And suffer for his sake all paine Of torments, and all woes. These are his wordes and eke his life Whereas he comes or goes. IV. THE LYE, By Sir Walter Raleigh, —is found in a very scarce miscellany intitled “Davison's Poems, or a poeticall Rapsodie divided into sixe books. . . . . The 4th impression newly corrected and augmented, and put into a forme more pleasing to the reader. Lond. 1621. 12mo.” This poem is reported to have been written by its celebrated author the night before his execution, Oct. 29. 1618. But this must be a mistake, for there were at least two editions of Davison's poems before that time, one in 1608 Catalog of T. Rawlinson 1727.: the other in 1611 Cat. of Sion coll. library. This is either lost or mislaid.. So that unless this poem was an after-insertion in the 4th edit. it must have been written long before the death of Sir Walter: perhaps it was composed soon after his condemnation in 1603. Goe, soule, the bodies guest, Upon a thankelesse arrant; Feare not to touche the best, The truth shall be thy warrant: Goe, since I needs must dye, And give the world the lye. Goe tell the court, it glowes And shines like rotten wood; Goe tell the church it showes What's good, and doth no good: If church and court reply, Then give them both the lye. Tell potentates they live Acting by others actions; Not lov'd unlesse they give, Not strong but by their factions: If potentates reply, Give potentates the lye. Tell men of high condition, That rule affairs of state, Their purpose is ambition, Their practise onely hate; And if they once reply, Then give them all the lye. Tell them that brave it most, They beg for more by spending, Who in their greatest cost Seek nothing but commending; And if they make reply, Spare not to give the lye. Tell zeale, it lacks devotion; Tell love it is but lust; Tell time, it is but motion; Tell flesh, it is but dust; And wish them not reply, For thou must give the lye. Tell age, it daily wasteth; Tell honour, how it alters; Tell beauty, how she blasteth; Tell favour, how she falters; And as they shall reply, Give each of them the lye. Tell wit, how much it wrangles In tickle points of nicenesse; Tell wisedome, she entangles Herselfe in over-wisenesse; And if they do reply, Straight give them both the lye. Tell physicke of her boldnesse; Tell skill, it is pretension; Tell charity of coldness; Tell law, it is contention; And as they yield reply, So give them still the lye. Tell fortune of her blindnesse; Tell nature of decay; Tell friendship of unkindnesse; Tell justice of delay: And if they dare reply, Then give them all the lye. Tell arts, they have no soundnesse, But vary by esteeming; Tell schooles, they want profoundnesse, And stand too much on seeming: If arts and schooles reply, Give arts and schooles the lye. Tell faith, it's fled the citie; Tell how the countrey erreth; Tell, manhood shakes off pitie; Tell, vertue least preferreth: And, if they doe reply, Spare not to give the lye. So, when thou hast, as I Commanded thee, done blabbing, Although to give the lye Deserves no less than stabbing, Yet stab at thee who will, No stab the soule can kill. V. VERSES BY KING JAMES I. In the former edition of this book were inserted, by way of specimen of his majesty's poetic talents, some Punning Verses made on the disputations at Sterling: but it having been suggested to the editor, that the king only gave the quibbling commendations in prose, and that some obsequious court-rhymer put them into metre See a folio intitled “The Muses welcome to King James.”; it was thought proper to exchange them for two Sonnets of K. James's own composition. James was a great versifier, and therefore out of the multitude of his poems, we have here selected two, which (to shew our impartiality) are written in his best and his worst manner. The first would not dishonour any writer of that time; the second is a most complete example of the Bathos. A Sonnet addressed by King James to his son Prince Henry God gives not kings the stile of Gods in vaine, For on his throne his scepter do they swey: And as their subjects ought them to obey, So kings should feare and serve their God againe. If then ye would enjoy a happie reigne, Observe the statutes of our heavenly king; And from his law make all your laws to spring; Since his lieutenant here ye should remaine. Rewarde the just, be stedfast, true and plaine; Represse the proud, maintayning aye the right; Walke always so, as ever in his sight, Who guardes the godly, plaguing the prophane. And so ye shall in princely vertues shine, Resembling right your mightie king divine. From K. James's works in folio: Where is also printed another called his Majesty's own Sonnet; it would perhaps be too cruel to infer from thence that this was not his Majesty's own Sonnet. A Sonnet occasioned by the bad Weather which hindred the Sports at Newmarket in January 1616. How cruelly these catives do conspire? What loathsome love breeds such a baleful band Betwixt the cankred king of Creta land Saturn., That melancholy old and angry fire, And him, who wont to quench debate and ire Among the Romans, when his ports were clos'd Janus.? But now his double face is still dispos'd, With Saturn's help, to freeze us at the fire. The earth ore-covered with a sheet of snow, Refuses food to fowl, to bird and beast: The chilling cold lets every thing to grow, And surfeits cattle with a starving feast. Curs'd be that love and mought continue short, Which kills all creatures, and doth spoil our sport. This is printed from Drummond of Hawthornden's works, folio: where also may be seen some verses of Lord Stirling's upon this Sonnet, which concludes with the finest Anticlimax I remember to have seen. VI. K. JOHN AND THE ABBOT OF CANTERBURY. The common popular ballad of King John and the abbot seem to have been abridged and modernized about the time of James I. from one much older, intitled King “John and the Bishop of Canterbury.” The Editor's folio MS. contains a copy of this last, but in too corrupt a state to be reprinted; it however afforded many lines worth reviving, which will be found inserted in the ensuing stanzas. The archness of the following questions and answers hath been much admired by our old ballad-makers; for besides the two copies above mentioned, there is extant another ballad on the same subject, (but of no great antiquity or merit) intitled, “King Olfrey and the Abbot See the collection of Hist. Ballads, 3 vol. 1727. Mr. Wise supposes Olfrey to be a corruption of Alfred, in his pamphlet concerning the White Horse in Berkshire, p. 15..” Lastly, about the time of the civil wars, when the cry ran against the bishops, some Puritan worked up the same story into a very doleful ditty, to a solemn tune, concerning “King Henry and a Bishop,” with this stinging moral, “Unlearned men hard matters out can find, “When learned bishops princes eyes do blind.” The following is chiefly printed from an ancient blackletter copy, to “The tune of Derry down.” An ancient story Ile tell you anon Of a notable prince, that was called king John; And he ruled England with maine and with might, For he did great wrong, and maintein'd little right. And Ile tell you a story, a story so merrye, Concerning the Abbot of Canterbùrye; How for his house-keeping, and high renowne, They rode poste for him to fair London towne. An hundred men, the king did heare say, The abbot kept in his house every day; And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt, In velvet coates waited the abbot about. How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee, Thou keepest a farre better house than mee, And for thy house-keeping and high renowne, I feare thou work'st treason against my crown. My liege, quo' the abbot, I would it were knowne, I never spend nothing, but what is my owne; And I trust, your grace will doe me no deere, For spending of my owne true-gotten geere. Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is highe, And now for the same thou needest must dye; For except thou canst answer me questions three, Thy head shall be smitten from thy bodìe. And first, quo' the king, when I'm in this stead, With my crowne of golde so faire on my head, Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worthe. Secondlye, tell me, without any doubt, How soone I may ride the whole world about; And at the third question thou must not shrink, But tell me here truly what I do think. O, these are hard questions for my shallow witt, Nor I cannot answer your grace as yet; But if you will give me but three weekes space, Ile do my endeavour to answer your grace. Now three weeks space to thee will I give, And that is the longest time thou hast to live; For if thou dost not answer my questions three, Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to mee. Away rode the abbot all sad at that word, And he rode to Cambridge, and Oxenford; But never a doctor there was so wise, That could with his learning an answer devise. Then home rode the abbot of comfort so cold, And he mett his shepheard a going to fold: How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home; What newes do you bring us from good king John? “Sad newes, sad newes, shepheard, I must give; That I have but three days more to live: For if I do not answer him questions three, My head will be smitten from my bodìe: The first is to tell him there in that stead, With his crowne of golde so fair on his head, Among all his liege men so noble of birth, To within one penny of what he is worth. The seconde, to tell him, without any doubt, How soone he may ride this whole world about: And at the third question I must not shrinke, But tell him there truly what he does thinke.” Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear yet, That a fool he may learn a wise man witt? Lend me horse, and serving men, and your apparel, And I'll ride to London to answere your quarrel. Nay frowne not, if it hath bin told unto mee, I am like your lordship, as ever may bee: And if you will but lend me your gowne, There is none shall knowe us at fair London towne. “Now horses, and serving-men thou shalt have, With sumptuous array most gallant and brave; With crozier, and miter, and rochet, and cope, Fit to appeare fore our fader the pope.” Now welcome, sire abbot, the king he did say, Tis well thou'rt come back to keepe thy day; For an if thou canst answer my questions three, Thy life and thy living both saved shall bee. And first, when thou seest me here in this stead, With my crown of golde so fair on my head, Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe, Tell me to one penny what I am worth. “For thirty pence our Saviour was sold Amonge the false Jewes, as I have bin told; And twenty nine is the worth of thee, For I thinke, thou art one penny worser than hee.” The king he laughed, and swore by St. Bittel Meaning probably St. Botolph., I did not think I had been worth so littel! —Now secondly tell me, without any doubt, How soone I may ride this whole world about. “You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same, Until the next morning he riseth againe; And then your grace need not make any doubt, But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about.” The king he laughed, and swore by St. Jone, I did not think, it could be gone so soone! —Now from the third question thou must not shrinke, But tell me here truly what I do thinke. “Yea, that shall I do, and make your grace merry: You thinke I'm the abbot of Canterbùry; But I'm his poor shepheard, as plain you may see, That am come to beg pardon for him and for mee.” The king he laughed, and swore by the masse, Ile make thee lord abbot this day in his place! “Now naye, my liege, be not in such speede, For alacke I can neither write, ne reade.” Four nobles a weeke, then I will give thee, For this merry jest thou hast showne unto mee; And tell the old abbot when thou comest home, Thou hast brought him a pardon from good king John. VII. YOU MEANER BEAUTIES. This little Sonnet was written by Sir Henry Wotton Knight, on that amiable Princess, Elizabeth daughter of James I. and wife of the Elector Palatine, who was chosen King of Bohemia, Sept. 5. 1619. The consequences of this fatal election are well known: Sir Henry Wotton, who in that and the following year was employed in several embassies in Germany on behalf of this unfortunate lady, seems to have had an uncommon attachment to her merit and fortunes, for he gave away a jewel worth a thousand pounds, that was presented to him by the Emperor, “because it came from an enemy to his royal mistress the Queen of Bohemia.” See Biog. Britan. This song is printed from the Reliquiæ Wottonianæ 1651. with some corrections from an old MS. copy. You meaner beauties of the night, Which poorly satisfie our eies More by your number, then your light; You common people of the skies, What are you when the Sun shall rise? Ye violets that first appeare, By your pure purple mantles known Like the proud virgins of the yeare, As if the Spring were all your own; What are you when the Rose is blown? Ye curious chaunters of the wood, That warble forth dame Nature's layes, Thinking your passions understood By your weak accents: what's your praise, When Philomell her voyce shall raise? So when my mistris shal be seene In sweetnesse of her looks and minde; By virtue first, then choyce a queen; Tell me, if she was not design'd Th'eclypse and glory of her kind? VIII. THE OLD AND YOUNG COURTIER. This excellent old song, the subject of which is a comparison between the manners of the old gentry, as still subsisting in the times of Elizabeth, and the modern refinements affected by their sons in the reigns of her successors, is given from an ancient black-letter copy in the Pepys collection, compared with another printed among some miscellaneous “poems and songs” in a book intituled, “Le Prince d' amour.” 1660. 8vo. An old song made by an aged old pate, Of an old worshipful gentleman, who had a greate estate, That kept a brave old house at a bountiful rate, And an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate; Like an old courtier of the queen's, And the queen's old courtier. With an old lady, whose anger one word asswages; They every quarter paid their old servants their wages, And never knew what belong'd to coachmen, footmen, nor pages, But kept twenty old fellows with blue coats and badges; Like an old courtier, &amp;c. With an old study fill'd full of learned old books, With an old reverend chaplain, you might know him by his looks. With an old buttery hatch worn quite off the hooks, And an old kitchen, that maintain'd half a dozen old cocks; Like an old courtier, &amp;c. With an old hall, hung about with pikes, guns, and bows, With old swords, and bucklers, that had born many shrewde blows, And an old frize coat, to cover his worship's trunk hose, And a cup of old sherry, to comfort his copper nose; Like an old courtier, &amp;c. With a good old fashion, when Christmasse was come, To call in all his old neighbours with bagpipe, and drum, With good chear enough to furnish every old room, And old liquor able to make a cat speak, and man dumb, Like an old courtier, &amp;c. With an old falconer, huntsman, and a kennel of hounds, That never hawked, nor hunted, but in his own grounds, Who, like a wise man, kept himself within his own bounds, And when he dyed gave every child a thousand good pounds; Like an old courtier, &amp;c. But to his eldest son his house and land he assign'd, Charging him in his will to keep the old bountifull mind, To be good to his old tenants, and to his neighbours be kind: But in the ensuing ditty you shall hear how he was inclin'd; Like a young courtier of the king's, And the king's young courtier. Like a flourishing young gallant, newly come to his land, Who keeps a brace of painted madams at his command, And takes up a thousand pound upon his fathers land, And gets drunk in a tavern, till he can neither go nor stand; Like a young courtier, &amp;c. With a new-fangled lady, that is dainty, nice, and spare, Who never knew what belong'd to good house-keeping, or care, Who buyes gaudy-color'd fans to play with wanton air, And seven or eight different dressings of other womens hair; Like a young courtier, &amp;c. With a new-fashion'd hall, built where the old one stood, Hung round with new pictures, that do the poor no good, With a fine marble chimney, wherein burns neither coal nor wood, And a new smooth shovelboard, whereon no victuals ne'er stood; Like a young courtier, &amp;c. With a new study, stuft full of pamphlets, and plays, And a new chaplain, that swears faster than he prays, With a new buttery hatch, that opens once in four or five days, And a new Frenck cook, to devise fine kickshaws, and toys; Like a young courtier, &amp;c. With a new fashion, when Christmas is drawing on, On a new journey to London straight we all must begone, And leave none to keep house, but our new porter John, Who relieves the poor with a thump on the back with a stone; Like a young courtier, &amp;c. With a new gentleman-usher, whose carriage is compleat, With a new coachman, footmen, and pages to carry up the meat, With a waiting-gentlewoman, whose dressing is very neat, Who when her lady has din'd, lets the servants not eat; Like a young courtier, &amp;c. With new titles of honour bought with his father's old gold, For which sundry of his ancestors old manors are sold; And this is the course most of our new gallants hold, Which makes that good house-keeping is now grown so cold, Among the young courtiers of the king, Or the king's young courtiers. IX. SIR JOHN SUCKLING'S CAMPAIGNE. The attribution of this poem is questionable. When the Scottish covenanters rose up in arms, and advanced to the English borders in 1639, many of the courtiers complimented the king by raising forces at their own expence. Among these none were more distinguished than the gallant Sir John Suckling, who raised a troop of horse, so richly accoutred, that it cost him 12,000 l. The like expensive equipment of other parts of the army, made the king remark, that “the Scots would fight stoutly, if it were but for the Englishmen's fine cloaths.” [Lloyd's memoirs.] When they came to action, the rugged Scots proved more than a match for the fine shewy English: many of whom behaved remarkably ill, and among the rest this splendid troop of Sir John Suckling's. This humorous pasquil has been generally supposed to have been written by Sir John, as a banter upon himself. Some of his contemporaries however attributed it to Sir John Mennis, a wit of those times, among whose poems it is printed in a small poetical miscellany intitled, “Musarum deliciæ: or the muses recreation, containing several pieces of poetique wit. 2d edition.—By Sir J. M. [Sir John Mennis] and Ja. S. [James Smith.] Lond. 1656. 12mo.”—[See Wood's Athenæ. II. 397. 418.] In that copy is subjoined an additional stanza, which probably was written by this Sir John Mennis, viz. “But now there is peace, he's return'd to increase “His money, which lately he spent-a, “But his lost honour must lye still in the dust; “At Barwick away it went-a.” Sir John he got him an ambling nag, To Scotland for to ride-a, With a hundred horse more, all his own he swore, To guard him on every side-a. No Errant-knight ever went to fight With halfe so gay a bravado, Had you seen but his look, you'ld have sworn on a book, Hee'ld have conquer'd a whole armado. The ladies ran all to the windows to see So gallant and warlike a sight-a, And as he pass'd by, they said with a sigh, Sir John, why will you go fight-a? But he, like a cruel knight, spurr'd on; His heart would not relent-a, For, till he came there, what had he to fear? Or why should he repent-a? The king (God bless him!) had singular hopes Of him and all his troop-a: The borderers they, as they met him on the way, For joy did hollow, and whoop-a. None lik'd him so well, as his own colonell, John de Wert was a German general of great reputation, and the terror of the French in the reign of Louis XIII. Hence his name became proverbial in France, where he was called De Vert. See Bayle's dict.Who took him for John de Wert-a; But when there were shows of gunning and blows, My gallant was so nothing pert-a. For when the Scots army came within sight, And all prepared to fight-a, He ran to his tent, they ask'd what he meant, He swore he must needs goe sh?te-a. The colonell sent for him back agen, To quarter him in the van-a, But Sir John did swear, he would not come there, To be kill'd the very first man-a. To cure his fear, he was sent to the reare, Some ten miles back, and more-a; Where Sir John did play at trip and away, And ne'er saw the enemy more-a. X. TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON. This excellent sonnet, which possessed a high degree of fame among the old Cavaliers, was written by Colonel Richard Lovelace during his confinement in the gate-house Westminster: to which he was committed by the house of Commons, in April 1642, for presenting a petition from the county of Kent, requesting them to restore the king to his rights, and to settle the government. See Wood's Athenæ, Vol. II. p. 228; where may be seen at large the affecting story of this elegant writer, who after having been distinguished for every gallant and polite accomplishment, the pattern of his own sex, and the darling of the ladies, died in the lowest wretchedness, obscurity, and want, in 1658. This song is printed from a scarce volume of his poems intitled, “Lucasta, 1649. 12mo.” collated with a copy in the editor's folio MS. When love with unconfined wings Hovers within my gates, And my divine Althea brings To whisper at my grates; When I lye tangled in her haire, And fetter'd with her eye, The birds that wanton in the aire, Know no such libertye. When flowing cups run swiftly round with woe-allaying themes. MS.With no allaying thames, Our carelesse heads with roses crown'd, Our hearts with loyal flames; When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe, When healths and draughts goe free, Fishes, that tipple in the deepe, Know no such libertìe. When, linnet-like, confined I With shriller note shall sing The mercye, sweetness, majestye, And glories of my king; When I shall voyce aloud how good, He is, how great should be, Th'enlarged windes, that curle the flood, Know no such libertìe. Stone walls doe not a prison make, Nor iron barres a cage, Mindes, innocent, and quiet, take That for an hermitage: If I have freedom in my love, And in my soule am free, Angels alone, that soare above, Enjoy such libertìe. XI. THE DOWNFALL OF CHARING-CROSS. Charing-cross, as it stood before the civil wars, was one of those beautiful Gothic obelisks erected to conjugal affection by Edward I. who built such a one wherever the herse of his beloved Eleanor rested in its way from Lincolnshire to Westminster. But neither its ornamental situation, the beauty of its structure, nor the noble design of its erection (which did honour to humanity) could preserve it from the merciless zeal of the times: For in 1642 it was demolished by order of the House of Commons, as popish and superstitious. This occasioned the following not-unhumorous sarcasm, which has been often printed among the popular sonnets of those times. The plot referred to in ver. 17. was that entered into by Mr. Waller the poet, and others, with a view to reduce the city and tower to the service of the king; for which two of them, Nath. Tomkins, and Rich. Chaloner, suffered death July 5. 1643. Vid. Ath. Ox. II. 24. Undone, undone the lawyers are, They wander about the towne, Nor can find the way to Westminster, Now Charing-cross is downe: At the end of the Strand, they make a stand, Swearing they are at a loss, And chassing say, that's not the way, They must go by Charing-cross. The parliament to vote it down Conceived it very fitting, For fear it should fall, and kill them all, In the house, as they were fitting. They were told god-wot, it had a plot, Which made them so hard-hearted, To give command, it should not stand, But be taken down and carted. Men talk of plots, this might have been worse For any thing I know, Than that Tomkins, and Chaloner Were hang'd for long agoe. Our parliament did that prevent, And wisely them defended, For plots they will discover still, Before they were intended. But neither man, woman, nor child, Will say, I'm confident, They ever heard it speak one word Against the parliament. An informer swore, it letters bore, Or else it had been freed; In troth I'll take my Bible oath, It could neither write, nor read. The committee said, that verily To popery it was bent; For ought I know, it might be so, For to church it never went. What with excise, and such device, The kingdom doth begin To think you'll leave them ne'er a cross, Without doors nor within. Methinks the common-council shou'd Of it have taken pity, 'Cause, good old cross, it always stood So firmly to the city. Since crosses you so much disdain, Faith, if I were as you, For fear the king should rule again, I'd pull down Tiburn too. Whitlocke says, “May 3. 1643, Cheapside cross and other crosses were voted down,” &amp;c.—When this vote was put in execution does not appear, probably not till many months after Tomkins and Chaloner had suffered. See above ver. 18. We had a very curious account of the pulling down of Cheapside Cross lately published in one of the numbers of the Gentleman's Magazine, 1766. XII. LOYALTY CONFINED. This excellent old song is preserved in David Lloyd's “Memoires of those that suffered in the cause of Charles I.” Lond. 1668. fol. p. 96. He speaks of it as the composition of a worthy personage, who suffered deeply in those times, and was still living with no other reward than the conscience of having suffered. The author's name he has not mentioned, but, if tradition may be credited, this song was written by Sir Roger L'Estrange.—Some mistakes in Lloyd's copy are corrected by two others, one in MS. the other in the Westminster Drollery, or a Choice Collection of Songs and Poems, 1671. 12mo. Beat on, proud billows; Boreas blow; Swell, curled waves, high as Jove's roof; Your incivility doth show, That innocence is tempest proof; Though surly Nereus frown, my thoughts are calm; Then strike, Affliction, for thy wounds are balm. That which the world miscalls a jail, A private closet is to me: Whilst a good conscience is my bail, And innocence my liberty: Locks, bars, and solitude together met, Make me no prisoner, but an anchoret. I, whilst I wisht to be retir'd, Into this private room was turn'd; As if their wisdoms had conspir'd The salamander should be burn'd; Or like those sophists, that would drown a fish, I am constrain'd to suffer what I wish. The cynick loves his poverty; The pelican her wilderness; And 'tis the Indian's pride to be Naked on frozen Caucasus: Contentment cannot smart, Stoicks we see Make torments easie to their apathy. These manacles upon my arm I, as my mistress' favours, wear; And for to keep my ancles warm, I have some iron shackles there: These walls are but my garrison; this cell, Which men call jail, doth prove my citadel. I'm in the cabinet lockt up, Like some high-prized margarite, Or, like the great mogul or pope, Am cloyster'd up from publick sight: Retirement is a piece of majesty, And thus, proud sultan, I'm as great as thee. Here sin for want of food must starve, Where tempting objects are not seen; And these strong walls do only serve To keep vice out, and keep me in: Malice of late's grown charitable sure, I'm not committed, but am kept secure. So he that struck at Jason's life, Thinking t'have made his purpose sure, By a malicious friendly knife Did only wound him to a cure: Malice, I see, wants wit; for what is meant Mischief, oftimes proves favour by th'event. When once my prince affliction hath, Prosperity doth treason seem; And to make smooth so rough a path, I can learn patience from him: Now not to suffer shews no loyal heart, When kings want ease subjects must bear a part. What though I cannot see my king Neither in person or in coin; Yet contemplation is a thing, That renders what I have not, mine: My king from me what adamant can part, Whom I do wear engraven on my heart? Have you not seen the nightingale, A prisoner like, coopt in a cage, How doth she chaunt her wonted tale In that her narrow hermitage? Even then her charming melody doth prove, That all her bars are trees, her cage a grove. I am that bird, whom they combine Thus to deprive of liberty; But though they do my corps confine, Yet maugre heat, my soul is free: And though immur'd, yet can I chirp, and sing Disgrace to rebels, glory to my king. My soul is free, as ambient air, Although my baser part's immew'd, Whilst loyal thoughts do still repair T'accompany my solitude: Although rebellion do my body binde, My king alone can captivate my minde. XIII. VERSES BY K. CHARLES I. “This prince, like his father, did not confine himself to prose: Bishop Burnet has given as a pathetic elegy said to be written by Charles in Carisbrook castle [in 1648.] The poetry is most uncouth and unharmonious, but there are strong thoughts in it, some good sense, and a strain of majestic piety.” Mr. Walpole's Royal and Noble Authors, vol. I. It is in his “Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton,” p. 379. that Burnet hath preserved this elegy, which he tells us he had from a gentleman, who waited on the king at the time when it was written, and copied it out from the original. It is there intitled “MAJESTY IN MISERY: OR AN IMPLORATION TO THE KING OF KINGS.” Hume hath remarked of these stanzas, “that the truth of the sentiment, rather than the elegance of the expression, renders them very pathetic.” See his hist. 1763. 4to. vol. 5. p. 437. 442. which is no bad comment upon them. —These are almost the only verses known of Charles's composure. Indeed a little Poem On a quiet Conscience, printed in the Poetical Calendar, 1763. vol. 8th. is attributed to K. Charles I; but I know not upon what authority. Great monarch of the world, from whose power springs The potency and power of kings, Record the royal woe my suffering sings; And teach my tongue, that ever did confine Its faculties in truth's seraphick line, To track the treasons of thy foes and mine. Nature and law, by thy divine decree, (The only root of righteous royaltie) With this dim diadem invested me: With it, the sacred scepter, purple robe, The holy unction, and the royal globe: Yet am I levell'd with the life of Job. The fiercest furies, that do daily tread Upon my grief, my gray discrowned head, Are those that owe my bounty for their bread. They raise a war, and christen it the cause, While sacrilegious hands have best applause, Plunder and murder are the kingdom's laws; Tyranny bears the title of taxation, Revenge and robbery are reformation, Oppression gains the name of sequestration. My loyal subjects, who in this bad season Attend me (by the law of God and reason), They dare impeach, and punish for high treason. Next at the clergy do their furies frown, Pious episcopacy must go down, They will destroy the crosier and the crown. Churchmen are chain'd, and schismaticks are freed, Mechanicks preach, and holy fathers bleed, The crown is crucified with the creed. The church of England doth all factions foster, The pulpit is usurpt by each impostor, Extempore excludes the Pater-noster. The Presbyter, and Independent seed Springs with broad blades. To make the religion bleed Herod and Pontius Pilate are agreed. The corner stone's misplac'd by every pavier: With such a bloody method and behaviour Their ancestors did crucifie our Saviour. My royal consort, from whose fruitful womb So many princes legally have come, Is forc'd in pilgrimage to seek a tomb. Great Britain's heir is forced into France, Whilst on his father's head his foes advance: Poor child! he weeps out his inheritance. With my own power my majesty they wound, In the king's name the king himself's uncrown'd: So doth the dust destroy the diamond. With propositions daily they enchant My people's ears, such as do reason daunt, And the Almighty will not let me grant. They promise to erect my royal stem, To make me great, t'advance my diadem, If I will first fall down, and worship them! But for refusal they devour my thrones, Distress my children, and destroy my bones; I fear they'll force me to make bread of stones. My life they prize at such a slender rate, That in my absence they draw bills of hate, To prove the king a traytor to the state. Felons obtain more privilege than I, They are allow'd to answer ere they die; 'Tis death for me to ask the reason, why. But, sacred Saviour, with thy words I woo Thee to forgive, and not be bitter to Such, as thou know'st do not know what they do. For since they from their lord are so disjointed, As to contemn those edicts he appointed, How can they prize the power of his anointed? Augment my patience, nullifie my hate, Preserve my issue, and inspire my mate, Yet though we perish, bless this church and state. XIV. THE SALE OF REBELLIOUS HOUSHOLD-STUFF This sarcastic exultation of triumphant loyalty, is printed from an old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection, corrected by two others, one of which is preserved in “A choice collection of 120 loyal songs, &amp;c.” 1684. 12mo.—To the tune of Old Simon the king. Rebellion hath broken up house, And hath left me old lumber to sell; Come hither, and take your choice, I'll promise to use you well: Will you buy the old speaker's chair? Which was warm and easie to sit in, And oft hath been clean'd I declare, When as it was fouler than sitting. Says old Simon the king, &amp;c. Will you buy any bacon-flitches, The fattest, that ever were spent? They're the sides of the old committees, Fed up in the long parliament. Here's a pair of bellows, and tongs, And for a small matter I'll sell ye 'um; They are made of the presbyters lungs, To blow up the coals of rebellion. Says old Simon, &amp;c. I had thought to have given them once To some black-smith for his forge, But now I have considered on't, They are consecrate to the church: So I'll give them unto some quire, They will make the big organs roar, And the little pipes to squeeke higher, Than ever they could before. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Here's a couple of stools for sale, One's square, and t'other is round; Betwixt them both the tail Of the Rump fell down to the ground. Will you buy the states council-table, Which was made of the good wain Scot? The frame was a tottering Babel To uphold the Independent plot. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Here's the beesom of Reformation, Which should have made clean the floor, But it swept the wealth out of the nation, And left us dirt good store. Will you buy the states spinning-wheel, Which spun for the ropers trade? But better it had stood still, For now it has spun a fair thread. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Here's a glyster-pipe well try'd, Which was made of a butcher's stump Alluding probably to Major-General Harrison a butcher's son, who assisted Cromwell in turning out the long parliament, Ap. 20. 1653., And has been safely apply'd, To cure the colds of the rump. Here's a lump of Pilgrims-Salve, Which once was a justice of peace, Who Noll and the Devil did serve; But now it is come to this. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Here's a roll of the states tobacco, If any good fellow will take it; No Virginia had e'er such a smack-o, And I'll tell you how they did make it: 'Tis th'Engagement, and Covenant cookt Up with the Abjuration oath; And many of them, that have took't, Complain it was foul in the mouth. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Yet the ashes may happily serve To cure the scab of the nation, Whene'er 't has an itch to swerve To Rebellion by Innovation. A Lanthorn here is to be bought, The like was scarce ever gotten, For many plots it has found out Before they ever were thought on. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Will you buy the rump's great saddle, With which it jocky'd the nation? And here is the bitt, and the bridle, And curb of Dissimulation: And here's the trunk-hose of the rump, And their fair dissembling cloak, And a Presbyterian jump, With an Independent smock. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Will you buy a Conscience oft turn'd, Which serv'd the high-court of justice, And stretch'd until England it mourn'd: But Hell will buy that if the worst is. Here's Joan Cromwell's kitching-stuff tub, This was a cant name given to Cromwell's wife by the Royalists, tho' her name was Elizabeth: to the latter part of the verse hangs some tale that is now forgotten. Wherein is the fat of the Rumpers, With which old Noll's horns she did rub, When she was got drunk with false bumpers. Says old Simon, &amp;c. Here's the purse of the public faith; Here's the model of the Sequestration, When the old wives upon their good troth, Lent thimbles to ruine the nation. See Grey's Hudibras, Pt. 1. Cant. 2. ver. 570. &amp;c. Here's Dick Cromwell's Protectorship, And here are Lambert's commissions, And here is Hugh Peters his scrip Cramm'd with the tumultuous Petitions. Says old Simon, &amp;c. And here are old Noll's brewing vessels, Cromwell had in his younger years followed the brewing trade at Huntingdon. Col. Hewson is said to have been originally a cobler. And here are his dray, and his slings; Here are Hewson's awl, and his bristles; Cromwell had in his younger years followed the brewing trade at Huntingdon. Col Hewson is said to have been originally a cobler. With diverse other odd things: And what is the price doth belong To all these matters before ye? I'll sell them all for an old song, And so I do end my story. Says old Simon, &amp;c. XV. THE BAFFLED KNIGHT, OR LADY'S POLICY. Given (with some corrections) from a MS copy, and collated with two printed ones in Roman character in the Pepys collection. There was a knight was drunk with wine, A riding along the way, sir; And there he met with a lady fine, Among the cocks of hay, sir. Shall you and I, O lady faire, Among the grass lye downe-a: And I will have a special care Of rumpling of your gowne-a. Upon the grass there is a dewe, Will spoil my damask gowne, sir: My gown, and kirtle they are newe, And cost me many a crowne, sir. I have a cloak of scarlet red, Upon the ground I'll throwe it; Then, lady faire, come lay thy head; We'll play, and none shall knowe it. O yonder stands my steed so free Among the cocks of hay, sir; And if the pinner should chance to see, He'll take my steed away, sir. Upon my finger I have a ring, Its made of finest gold-a; And, lady, it thy steed shall bring Out of the pinner's fold-a. O go with me to my father's hall; Fair chambers there are three, sir: And you shall have the best of all, And I'll your chamberlaine bee, sir. He mounted himself on his steed so tall, And her on her dapple gray, sir: And there they rode to her father's hall, Fast pricking along the way, sir. To her father's hall they arrived strait; 'Twas moated round about-a; She slipped herself within the gate, And lockt the knight without-a. Here is a silver penny to spend, And take it for your pain, sir; And two of my father's men I'll send To wait on you back again, sir. He from his scabbard drew his brand, And whet it upon his sleeve-a: And cursed, he said, be every man, That will a maid believe-a! She drew a bodkin from her haire, And whip'd it upon her gown-a; And curst be every maiden faire, That will with men lye down-a! A tree there is, that lowly grows, And some do call it rue, sir: The smallest dunghill cock that crows, Would make a capon of you, sir. A flower there is, that shineth bright, Some call it mary-gold-a: He that wold not when he might, He shall not when he wold-a. The knight was riding another day, With cloak and hat and feather: He met again with that lady gay, Who was angling in the river. Now, lady faire, I've met with you, You shall no more escape me; Remember, how not long agoe You falsely did intrap me. The lady blushed scarlet red, And trembled at the stranger: How shall I guard my maidenhed From this approaching danger? He from his saddle down did light, In all his riche attyer; And cryed, As I am a noble knight, I do thy charms admyer. He took the lady by the hand, Who seemingly consented; And would no more disputing stand: She had a plot invented. Looke yonder, good sir knight, I pray, Methinks I now discover A riding upon his dapple gray, My former constant lover. On tip-toe peering stood the knight, Fast by the rivers brink-a; The lady pusht with all her might: Sir knight, now swim or sink-a. O'er head and ears he plunged in, The bottom faire he sounded; Then rising up, he cried amain, Help, helpe, or else I'm drowned! Now, fare-you-well, sir knight, adieu! You see what comes of fooling: That is the fittest place for you; Your courage wanted cooling. Ere many days, in her fathers park, Just at the close of eve-a, Again she met with her angry sparke; Which made this lady grieve-a. False lady, here thou'rt in my powre, And no one now can hear thee: And thou shalt sorely rue the hour, That e'er thou dar'dst to jeer me. I pray, sir knight, be not so warm With a young silly maid-a: I vow and swear I thought no harm, 'Twas a gentle jest I playd-a. A gentle jest, in soothe! he cry'd, To tumble me in and leave me: What if I had in the river dy'd?— That fetch will not deceive me. Once more I'll pardon thee this day, Tho' injur'd out of measure; But then prepare without delay To yield thee to my pleasure. Well then, if I must grant your suit, Yet think of your boots and spurs, sir: Let me pull off both spur and boot, Or else you cannot stir, sir. He set him down upon the grass, And begg'd her kind assistance: Now, smiling thought this lovely lass, I'll make you keep your distance. Then pulling off his boots half-way; Sir knight, now I'm your betters: You shall not make of me your prey; Sit there like a knave in fetters. The knight when she had served soe, He fretted, fum'd, and grumbled: For he could neither stand nor goe, But like a cripple tumbled. Farewell, sir knight, the clock strikes ten, Yet do not move nor stir, sir: I'll send you my father's serving men, To pull off your boots and spurs, sir. This merry jest you must excuse, You are but a stingless nettle: You'd never have stood for boots or shoes, Had you been a man of mettle. All night in grievous rage he lay, Rolling upon the plain-a; Next morning a shepherd past that way, Who set him right again-a. Then mounting upon his steed so tall, By hill and dale he swore-a: I'll ride at once to her father's hall; She shall escape no more-a. I'll take her father by the beard, I'll challenge all her kindred; Each dastard soul shall stand affeard; My wrath shall no more be hindred. He rode unto her father's house, Which every side was moated: The lady heard his furious vows, And all his vengeance noted. Thought shee, sir knight, to quench your rage, Once more I will endeavour; This water shall your fury 'swage, Or else it shall burn for ever. Then faining penitence and feare, She did invite a parley: Sir knight, if you'll forgive me heare, Henceforth I'll love you dearly. My father he is now from home, And I am all alone, sir: Therefore a-cross the water come; And I am all your own, sir. False maid, thou canst no more deceive; I scorn the treacherous bait-a: If thou would'st have me thee believe, Now open me the gate-a. The bridge is drawn, the gate is barr'd, My father he has the keys, sir. But I have for my love prepar'd A shorter way and easier. Over the moate I've laid a plank Full seventeen feet in measure: Then step a-cross to the other bank, And there we'll take our pleasure. These words she had no sooner spoke, But strait he came tripping over: The plank was saw'd, it snapping broke; And sous'd the unhappy lover. XVI. WHY SO PALE? The attribution of this poem is questionable. From Sir John Suckling's poems. This sprightly knight was born in 1613, and cut off by a fever about the 29th year of his age. See above, pag. 318. Why so pale and wan, fond lover? Prethee, why so pale? Will, when looking well can't move her, Looking ill prevail? Prethee why so pale? Why so dull and mute, young sinner? Prethee why so mute? Will, when speaking well can't win her, Saying nothing doe't? Prethee why so mute? Quit, quit for shame; this will not move, This cannot take her; If of herself she will not love, Nothing can make her. The devil take her! XVII. OLD TOM OF BEDLAM. Mad song the first. The attribution of this poem is questionable. It is worth attention, that the English have more songs and ballads on the subject of madness, than any of their neighbours. Whether it is that we are more liable to this calamity than other nations, or whether our native gloominess hath peculiarly recommended subjects of this cast to our writers, the fact is incontestable, as any one may be satisfied, who will compare the printed collections of French, Italian Songs, &amp;c. with those in our language. Out of a much larger quantity, we have selected half a dozen mad songs for these volumes. The three first are originals in their respective kinds; the merit of the three last is chiefly that of imitation. They were written at considerable intervals of time; but we have here grouped them together, that the reader may the better examine their comparative merits. He may consider them as so many trials of skill in a very peculiar subject, as the contest of so many rivals to shoot in the bow of Ulysses. The two first were probably written about the beginning of the last century; the third about the middle of it; the fourth and sixth towards the end; and the fifth within this present century. This is given from the editor's folio MS. compared with two or three old printed copies.—With regard to the author of this old rhapsody, in Walton's Compleat Angler, cap. 3. is a song in praise of angling, which the author says was made at his request “by Mr. William Basse, one that has made the choice songs of the Hunter in his career, and of Tom of Bedlam, and many others of note.” p. 84. See Mr. Hawkins's curious Edition, 8vo. of this excellent old Piece. Forth from my sad and darksome cell, Or from the deepe abysse of hell, Mad Tom is come into the world againe To see if he can cure his distempered braine. Feares and cares oppresse my soule: Harke, howe the angrye Fureys houle! Pluto laughes, and Proserpine is gladd To see poore naked Tom of Bedlam madd. Through the world I wander night and day To seeke my straggling senses, In an angrye moode I mett old Time, With his pentarchye of tenses: When me he spyed, Away he hyed, For time will stay for no man: In vaine with cryes I rent the skyes, For pity is not common. Cold and comfortless I lye: Helpe, oh helpe! or else I dye! Harke! I heare Apollo's teame, The carman 'gins to whistle; Chast Diana bends her bowe, The boare begins to bristle. Come, Vulcan, with tools and with tackles, To knocke off my troublesome shackles; Bid Charles make ready his waine To fetch me my senses againe. Last night I heard the dog-star bark; Mars met Venus in the darke; Limping Vulcan het an iron barr, And furiouslye made at the god of war: Mars with his weapon laid about, But Vulcan's temples had the gout, For his broad horns did so hang in his light, He could not see to aim his blowes aright: Mercurye the nimble post of heaven, Stood still to see the quarrell; Gorrel-bellyed Bacchus, gyant-like, Bestryd a strong-beere barrell. To mee he dranke, I did him thanke, But I could get no cyder; He dranke whole butts Till he burst his gutts, But mine were ne'er the wyder. Poore naked Tom is very drye: A little drinke for charitye! Harke, I hear Acteons horne! The huntsmen whoop and hallowe: Ringwood, Royster, Bowman, Jowler, All the chase do followe. The man in the moone drinkes clarret, Eates powder'd beef, turnip, and carret, But a cup of old Malaga sacke Will fire the bushe at his backe. XVIII. THE DISTRACTED PURITAN, Mad song the second. —was written about the beginning of the seventeenth century by the witty bishop Corbet, and is printed from the 3d edition of his poems, 12mo. 1672, compared with a more ancient copy in the editor's folio MS. Am I mad, O noble Festus, When zeal and godly knowledge Have put me in hope To deal with the pope, As well as the best in the college? Boldly I preach, hate a cross, hate a surplice, Mitres, copes, and rochets; Come hear me pray nine times a day, And fill your heads with crochets. In the house of pure Emanuel Emanuel college Cambridge was originally a seminary of Puritans. I had my education, Where my friends surmise I dazel'd my eyes With the sight of revelation. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. They bound me like a bedlam, They lash'd my four poor quarters; Whilst this I endure, Faith makes me sure To be one of Foxes martyrs. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. These injuries I suffer. Through antichrist's perswasion: Take off this chain, Neither Rome nor Spain Can resist my strong invasion. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. Of the beasts ten horns (God bless us!) I have knock'd off three already; If they let me alone I'll leave him none: But they say I am too heady. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. When I sack'd the seven-hill'd city, I met the great red dragon; I kept him aloof With the armour of proof, Though here I have never a rag on. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. With a fiery sword and target, There fought I with this monster: But the sons of pride My zeal deride, And all my deeds misconster. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. I un-hors'd the Whore of Babel, With the lance of Inspiration; I made her stink, And spill the drink In her cup of abomination. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. I have seen two in a vision With a flying book Alluding to some visionary exposition of Zech. ch. v. ver. 1. or, if the date of this song would permit, one might suppose it aimed at one Coppe, a strange enthusiast, whose life may be seen in Wood's Athen. vol. 2. p. 501. He was author of a book intitled, “The fiery flying Roll:” and afterwards published a Recantation, part of whose Title is, “The fiery flying Roll's wings clipt,” &amp;c. between them. I have been in despair Five times in a year, And been cur'd by reading Greenham See Greenham's works, fol. 1605. particularly the tract intitled, “A swert comfort for an afflicted conscience.”. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. I observ'd in Perkins tables See Perkins's works, fol. 1626. vol. 1. p. 11; where is a large half-sheet folded, containing “A survey, or table declaring the order of the causes of salvation, and damnation, &amp;c.” the pedigree of damnation being distinguished by a broad black zig-zag line. The black line of damnation; Those crooked veins So stuck in my brains, That I fear'd my reprobation. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. In the holy tongue of Canaan I plac'd my chiefest pleasure: Till I prick'd my foot With an Hebrew root, That I bled beyond all measure. Boldly I preach, &amp;c. I appear'd before the archbishop Laud., And all the high commission; I gave him no grace; But told him to his face, That he favour'd superstition. Boldly I preach, hate a cross, hate a surplice, Miters, copes, and rotchets: Come hear me pray nine times a day, And fill your heads with crotchets. XIX. THE LUNATIC LOVER, Mad song the third, —is given from an old printed copy in the British Museum, compared with another in the Pepys collection; both in black letter. Grim king of the ghosts, make haste, And bring hither all your train; See how the pale moon does waste, And just now is in the wane. Come, you night-hags, with all your charms, And revelling witches away, And hug me close in your arms; To you my respects I'll pay. I'll court you, and think you fair, Since love does distract my brain: I'll go, I'll wed the night-mare, And kiss her, and kiss her again: But if she prove peevish and proud, Then, a pise on her love! let her go; I'll seek me a winding shroud, And down to the shades below. A lunacy sad I endure, Since reason departs away; I call to those hags for a cure, As knowing not what I say. The beauty, whom I do adore, Now slights me with scorn and disdain; I never shall see her more: Ah! how shall I bear my pain! I ramble, and range about To find out my charming saint; While she at my grief does flout, And smiles at my loud complaint. Distraction I see is my doom, Of this I am now too sure; A rival is got in my room, While torments I do endure. Strange fancies do fill my head, While wandering in despair, I am to the desarts lead, Expecting to find her there. Methinks in a spangled cloud I see her enthroned on high; Then to her I crie aloud, And labour to reach the sky. When thus I have raved awhile, And wearyed myself in vain, I lye on the barren soil, And bitterly do complain. Till slumber hath quieted me, In sorrow I sigh and weep; The clouds are my canopy To cover me while I sleep. I dream that my charming fair Is then in my rival's bed, Whose tresses of golden hair Are on the fair pillow bespread. Then this doth my passion inflame, I start, and no longer can lie: Ah! Sylvia, art thou not to blame To ruin a lover? I cry. Grim king of the ghosts, be true, And hurry me hence away, My languishing life to you A tribute I freely pay. To the elysian shades I post In hopes to be freed from care, Where many a bleeding ghost Is hovering in the air. XX. THE LADY DISTRACTED WITH LOVE, Mad Song the fourth, —was originally sung in one of Tom D'urfey's comedies of Don Quixote acted in 1694 and 1696; and probably composed by himself. In the several stanzas, the author represents his pretty Mad-woman as 1. sullenly mad: 2. mirthfully mad: 3. melancholy mad: 4. fantastically mad: and 5. stark mad. Both this, and Num. XXII. are printed from D'urfey's “Pills to purge Melancholy.” 1719. vol. I. From rosie bowers, where sleeps the god of love, Hither, ye little wanton cupids, fly; Teach me in soft melodious strains to move With tender passion my heart's darling joy: Ah! let the soul of musick tune my voice, To win dear Strephon, who my soul enjoys. Or, if more influencing Is to be brisk and airy, With a step and a bound, With a frisk from the ground, I'll trip like any fairy. As once on Ida dancing Were three celestial bodies: With an air, and a face, And a shape, and a grace, I'll charm, like beauty's goddess. Ah! 'tis in vain! 'tis all, 'tis all in vain! Death and despair must end the fatal pain: Cold, cold despair, disguis'd like snow and rain, Falls on my breast; bleak winds in tempests blow; My veins all shiver, and my fingers glow; My pulse beats a dead march for lost repose, And to a solid lump of ice my poor fond heart is froze. Or say, ye powers, my peace to crown, Shall I thaw myself, and drown Among the foaming billows? Increasing all with tears I shed, On beds of ooze, and crystal pillows Lay down, lay down my lovesick head? No, no, I'll strait run mad, mad, mad, That soon my heart will warm; When once the sense is fled, is fled, Love has no power to charm. Wild thro' the woods I'll fly, I'll fly, Robes, locks—shall thus—be tore! A thousand, thousand times I'll dye Ere thus, thus, in vain,—ere thus in vain adore. XXI. THE DISTRACTED LOVER, Mad Song the fifth, —was written by Henry Carey, a celebrated composer of Music at the beginning of this century, and author of several little Theatrical Entertainments, which the reader may find enumerated in the “Companion to the Play-house,” &amp;c. The sprightliness of this Songster's fancy could not preserve him from a very melancholy catastrophe, which was effected by his own hand. In his Poems, 4 to. Lond. 1729, may be seen another Mad-Song of this author begining thus, “Gods! I can never this endure, “Death alone must be my cure, &amp;c. I go to the Elysian shade, Where sorrow ne'er shall wound me; Where nothing shall my rest invade, But joy shall still surround me. I fly from Celia's cold disdain, From her disdain I fly; She is the cause of all my pain, For her alone I die. Her eyes are brighter than the mid-day sun, When he but half his radiant course has run, When his meridian glories gaily shine, And gild all nature with a warmth divine, See yonder river's flowing tide, Which now so full appears; Those streams, that do so swiftly glide, Are nothing but my tears. There I have wept till I could weep no more, And curst mine eyes, when they have wept their store, Then, like the clouds, that rob the azure main, I've drain'd the flood to weep it back again. Pity my pains, Ye gentle swains! Cover me with ice and snow, I scorch, I burn, I flame, I glow! Furies, tear me, Quickly bear me To the dismal shades below! Where yelling, and howling And grumbling, and growling Strike the ear with horrid woe. Hissing snakes, Fiery lakes Would be a pleasure, and a cure: Not all the hells, Where Pluto dwells, Can give such pain as I endure. To some peaceful plain convey me, On a mossey carpet lay me, Fan me with ambrosial breeze, Let me die, and so have ease! XXII. THE FRANTIC LADY, Mad Song the sixth. This, like Num. XX, was originally sung in one of D'urfey's Comedies of Don Quixote, (first acted about the year 1694), and was probably composed by that popular Songster, who died Feb. 26. 1723. This is printed from the “Hive, a Collection of Songs,” 4 vol. 1721. 12mo. where may be found two or three other Mad Songs not admitted into these Volumes. I burn, my brain consumes to ashes! Each eye-ball too like lightning flashes! Within my breast there glows a solid fire, Which in a thousand ages can't expire! Blow, blow, the winds' great ruler! Bring the Po, and the Ganges hither, 'Tis sultry weather, Pour them all on my soul, It will hiss like a coal, But be never the cooler. 'Twas pride hot as hell, That first made me rebell, From love's awful throne a curst angel I fell; And mourn now my fate, Which myself did create: Fool, fool, that consider'd not when I was well! Adieu! ye vain transporting joys! Off ye vain fantastic toys! That dress this face—this body—to allure! Bring me daggers, poison, fire! Since scorn is turn'd into desire. All hell feels not the rage, which I, poor I, endure. XXIII. LILLI BURLERO. The following rhymes, slight and insignificant as they may now seem, had once a more powerful effect than either the Philippies of Demosthenes, or Cicero; and contributed not a little towards the great revolution in 1688. Let us hear a contemporary writer. “A foolish ballad was made at that time, treating the Papists, and chiefly the Irish, in a very ridiculous manner, which had a burden said to be Irish words, “Lero, lero, liliburlero,” that made an impression on the [king's] army, that cannot be imagined by those that saw it not. The whole army, and at last the people both in city and country, were singing it perpetually. And perhaps never had so slight a thing so great an effect.” Burnet. It was written on occasion of the king's nominating to the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1686, general Talbot, newly created earl of Tyrconnel, a furious Papist, who had recommended himself to his bigotted master by his arbitrary treatment of the Protestants in the preceding year, when only lieutenant general; and whose subsequent conduct fully justified his expectations and their fears. The violences of his administration may be seen in any of the histories of those timts: particularly in bishop King's “State of the protestants in Ireland.” 1691. 4to. Lilliburlero and Bullen-a-lah are said to have been the words of distinction used among the Irish Papists in their massacre of the Protestants in 1641. Ho! broder Teague, dost hear de decree! Lilli burlero bullen a-la. Dat we shall have a new deputie, Lilli burlero bullen a-la. Lero lero, lilli burlero, lero lero, bullen a-la, Lero lero, lilli burlero, lero lero, bullen a-la. Ho! by shaint Tyburn, it is de Talbote: Lilli, &amp;c. And he will cut all de English troate. Lilli, &amp;c. Dough by my shoul de English do praat, Lilli, &amp;c. De law's on dare side, and Creish knows what. Lilli, &amp;c. But if dispence do come from de pope, Lilli, &amp;c. We'll hang Magna Charta, and dem in a rope. Lilli, &amp;c.

Lilli, &amp;c. Ara! but why does he stay behind? Lilli, &amp;c. Ho! by my shoul 'tis a protestant wind. Lilli, &amp;c. But see de Tyrconnel is now come ashore, Lilli, &amp;c.

For Talbot's de dog, and Ja?s is de ass. Lilli, &amp;c. XXIV. THE BRAES OF YARROW, In imitation of the ancient Scots manner, —was written by William Hamilton of Bangour, Esq; who died March 25. 1754. aged 50. It is printed from an elegant edition of his Poems published at Edinburgh, 1760, 12mo. A.Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny bonny bride, Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow, Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny bonny bride, And think nae mair on the Braes of Yarrow. B.Where gat ye that bonny bonny bride? Where gat ye that winsome marrow? A.I gat her where I dare na weil be seen, Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow. Weep not, weep not, my bonny bonny bride, Weep not, weep not, my winsome marrow; Nor let thy heart lament to leive Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow. B. Why does she weep, thy bonny bonny bride? Why does she weep thy winsome marrow? And why dare ye nae mair weil be seen Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow? A. Lang maun she weep, lang maun she, maun she weep, Lang maun she weep with dule and sorrow; And lang maun I nae mair weil be seen Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow. For she has tint her luver, luver dear, Her luver dear, the cause of sorrow, And I hae slain the comliest swain That eir pu'd birks on the Braes of Yarrow. Why rins thy stream, O Yarrow, Yarrow, reid? Why on thy braes heard the voice of sorrow? And why yon melancholious weids Hung on the bonny birks of Yarrow? What's yonder floats on the rueful rueful flude? What's yonder floats? O dule and sorrow! O 'tis he the comely swain I slew Upon the duleful Braes of Yarrow. Wash, O wash his wounds, his wounds in tears, His wounds in tears with dule and sorrow; And wrap his limbs in mourning weids, And lay him on the Braes of Yarrow. Then build, then build, ye sisters, sisters sad, Ye sisters sad, his tomb with sorrow; And weep around in waeful wise His hapless fate on the Braes of Yarrow. Curse ye, curse ye, his useless, useless shield, My arm that wrought the deed of sorrow, The fatal spear that pierc'd his breast, His comely breast on the Braes of Yarrow. Did I not warn thee, not to, not to luve? And warn from fight? but to my sorrow Too rashly bauld a stronger arm Thou mett'st, and fell'st on the Braes of Yarrow. Sweet smells the birk, green grows, green grows the grass, Yellow on Yarrow's bank the gowan, Fair hangs the apple frae the rock, Sweet the wave of Yarrow flowan. Flows Yarrow sweet? as sweet, as sweet flows Tweed, As green its grass, its gowan as yellow, As sweet smells on its braes the birk, The apple frae its rock as mellow. Fair was thy luve, fair fair indeed thy luve, In flow'ry bands thou didst him fetter; Tho' he was fair, and weil beluv'd again Than me he never luv'd thee better. Busk ye, then busk, my bouny bonny bride, Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow, Busk ye, and luve me on the banks of Tweed, And think nae mair on the Braes of Yarrow. C. How can I busk a bonny bonny bride? How can I busk a winsome marrow? How luve him upon the banks of Tweed, That slew my luve on the Braes of Yarrow? O Yarrow fields, may never never rain, Now dew thy tender blossoms cover, For there was basely slain my luve, My luve, as he had not been a lover. The boy put on his robes, his robes of green, His purple vest, 'twas my awn sewing: Ah! wretched me! I little, little kenn'd He was in these to meet his ruin. The boy took out his milk-white, milk-white steed, Unheedful of my dule and sorrow; But ere the toofall of the night He lay a corps on the Braes of Yarrow. Much I rejoyc'd that waeful waeful day; I sang, my voice the woods returning: But lang ere night the spear was flown, That slew my luve, and left me mourning. What can my barbarous barbarous father do, But with his cruel rage pursue me? My luver's blood is on thy spear, How canst thou, barbarous man, then wooe me? My happy sisters may be, may be proud With cruel, and ungentle scoffin', May bid me seek on Yarrow's Braes My luver nailed in his coffin. My brother Douglas may upbraid, upbraid, And strive with threatning words to muve me: My luver's blood is on thy spear, How canst thou ever bid me luve thee? Yes, yes, prepare the bed, the bed of luve, With bridal sheets my body cover, Unbar, ye bridal maids, the door, Let in the expected husbande lover. But who the expected husband husband is? His hands, methinks, are bath'd in slaughter: Ah me! what ghastly spectre's yon Comes in his pale shroud, bleeding after? Pale as he is, here lay him, lay him down, O lay his cold head on my pillow; Take aff, take aff these bridal weids, And crown my careful head with willow. Pale tho' thou art, yet best, yet best beluv'd, O could my warmth to life restore thee! Yet lye all night between my breists, No youth lay ever there before thee. Pale, pale indeed, O luvely luvely youth, Forgive, forgive so foul a slaughter, And lye all night between my breists, No youth shall ever lye there after. A. Return, return, O mournful, mournful bride, Return and dry thy useless sorrow: Thy luver heeds nought of thy sighs, He lyes a corps in the Braes of Yarrow. XXV. ADMIRAL HOSIER'S GHOST —was written by the ingenious author of Leonidas, on the taking of Porto Bello from the Spaniards by Admiral Vernon, Nov. 22. 1739.—The case of Hosier, which is here so pathetically represented, was briefly this. In April, 1726, that commander was sent with a strong fleet into the Spanish West-Indies, to block up the galleons in the Ports of that country, or should they presume to come out, to seize and carry them into England: he accordingly arrived at the Bastimentos near Porto Bello, but being restricted by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage, lay inactive on that station until he became the jest of the Spaniards: he afterwards removed to Carthagena, and continued cruizing in these seas, till far the greater part of his men perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy climate. This brave man, seeing his best officers and men thus daily swept away, his ships exposed to inevitable destruction, and himself made the sport of the enemy, is said to have died of a broken heart. See Smollet's hist. The following song is commonly accompanied with a Second Part, or Answer, which being of inferior merit, and apparently written by another hand, hath been rejected. As near Porto-Bello lying On the gently swelling flood, At midnight with streamers flying Our triumphant navy rode; There while Vernon sate all-glorious From the Spaniards' late defeat: And his crews, with shouts victorious, Drank success to England's fleet: On a sudden shrilly sounding, Hideous yells and shrieks were heard; Then each heart with fear confounding, A sad troop of ghosts appear'd, All in dreary hammocks shrouded, Which for winding-sheets they wore, And with looks by sorrow clouded Frowning on that hostile shore. On them gleam'd the moon's wan lustre, When the shade of Hosier brave His pale bands was seen to muster Rising from their watry grave: O'er the glimmering wave he hy'd him, Where the Burford The Admiral's ship. rear'd her sail, With three thousand ghosts beside him, And in groans did Vernon hail. Heed, oh heed our fatal story, I am Hosier's injur'd ghost, You, who now have purchas'd glory, At this place where I was lost! Tho' in Porto-Bello's ruin You now triumph free from fears, When you think on our undoing, You will mix your joy with tears. See these mournful spectres sweeping Ghastly o'er this hated wave, Whose wan cheeks are stain'd with weeping; These were English captains brave: Mark those numbers pale and horrid, Those were once my sailors bold, Lo, each hangs his drooping forehead, While his dismal tale is told. I, by twenty sail attended, Did this Spanish town affright; Nothing then its wealth defended But my orders not to fight: Oh! that in this rolling ocean I had cast them with disdain, And obey'd my heart's warm motion To have quell'd the pride of Spain! For resistance I could fear none, But with twenty ships had done What thou, brave and happy Vernon, Hast atchiev'd with six alone. Then the bastimentos never Had our foul dishonour seen, Nor the sea the sad receiver Of this gallant train had been. Thus, like thee, proud Spain dismaying, And her galleons leading home, Though condemn'd for disobeying I had met a traitor's doom, To have fallen, my country crying He has play'd an English part, Had been better far than dying Of a griev'd and broken heart. Unrepining at thy glory, Thy successful arms we hail; But remember our sad story, And let Hosier's wrongs prevail. Sent in this foul clime to languish, Think what thousands fell in vain, Wasted with disease and anguish, Not in glorious battle slain. Hence with all my train attending From their oozy tombs below, Thro' the hoary foam ascending, Here I feed my constant woe: Here the bastimentos viewing, We recal our shameful doom, And our plaintive cries renewing, Wander thro' the midnight gloom. O'er these waves for ever mourning Shall we roam depriv'd of rest, If to Britain's shores returning You neglect my just request; After this proud foe subduing, When your patriot friends you see, Think on vengeance for my ruin, And for England sham'd in me. XXVI. JEMMY DAWSON. James Dawson was one of the Manchester rebels, who was hanged, drawn, and quartered on Kennington Common in the County of Surrey, July 30. 1746.—This ballad is founded on a remarkable fact, which was reported to have happened at his execution. It was written by the late William Shenstone, Esq; soon after the event, and has been printed amongst his posthumous works, 2 vols. 8vo. It is here given from a MS copy, which contained some small variations from that lately printed. Come listen to my mournful tale, Ye tender hearts, and lovers dear; Nor will you scorn to heave a sigh, Nor will you blush to shed a tear. And thou, dear Kitty, peerless maid, Do thou a pensive ear incline; For thou canst weep at every woe, And pity every plaint, but mine. Young Dawson was a gallant youth, A brighter never trod the plain; And well he lov'd one charming maid, And dearly was he lov'd again. One tender maid she lov'd him dear, Of gentle blood the damsel came, And faultless was her beauteous form, And spotless was her virgin fame. But curse on party's hateful strife, That led the faithful youth astray, The day the rebel clans appear'd: O had he never seen that day! Their colours and their sash he wore, And in the fatal dress was found; And now he must that death endure, Which gives the brave the keenest wound. How pale was then his true love's cheek, When Jemmy's sentence reach'd her ear? For never yet did Alpine snows So pale, nor yet so chill appear. With faltering voice she weeping said, Oh Dawson, monarch of my heart, Think not thy death shall end our loves, For thou and I will never part. Yet might sweet mercy find a place, And bring relief to Jemmy's woes, O George, without a prayer for thee My orisons should never close. The gracious prince that gives him life Would crown a never-dying flame, And every tender babe I bore Should learn to lisp the giver's name. But though, dear youth, thou shouldst be dragg'd To yonder ignominious tree, Thou shalt not want a faithful friend To share thy bitter fate with thee. O then her mourning coach was call'd, The sledge mov'd slowly on before; Tho' borne in a triumphal car, She had not lov'd her favourite more. She followed him, prepar'd to view The terrible behests of law; And the last scene of Jemmy's woes With calm and steadfast eye she saw. Distorted was that blooming face, Which she had fondly lov'd so long: And stifled was that tuneful breath, Which in her praise had sweetly sung: And sever'd was that beauteous neck, Round which her arms had fondly clos'd: And mangled was that beauteous breast, On which her love-sick head repos'd: And ravish'd was that constant heart, She did it every heart prefer; For tho' it could his king forget, 'Twas true and loyal still to her. Amid those unrelenting flames She bore this constant heart to see; But when 'twas moulder'd into dust, Now, now, she cried, I'll follow thee. My death, my death alone can show The pure and lasting love I bore: Accept, O heaven, of woes like ours, And let us, let us weep no more. The dismal scene was o'er and past, The lover's mournful hearse retir'd; The maid drew back her languid head, And sighing forth his name, expir'd. Tho' justice ever must prevail, The tear my Kitty sheds is due; For seldom shall she hear a tale So sad, so tender, and so true. THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK. THE END OF VOLUME THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE THIRD. An ordinary Song or Ballad, that is the delight of the common people, cannot fail to please all such readers, as are not unqualified for the entertainment by their affectation or their ignorance; and the reason is plain, because the same paintings of nature which recommended it to the most ordinary Reader, will appear beautiful to the most refined. Addison in Spectator, No: 70. ANCIENT SONGS AND BALLADS, &amp;c. SERIES THE THIRD. BOOK I. BALLADS ON KING ARTHUR, &amp;c. I. THE BOY AND THE MANTLE. —Is printed verbatim from the old MS described in the Preface. The Editor believes it more ancient, than it will appear to be at first sight; the transcriber of that manuscript having reduced the orthography and style in many instances to the standard of his own times. The incidents of the Mantle and the Knife have not, that I can recollect, been borrowed from any other writer. The former of these evidently suggested to Spenser his conceit of Florimel's Girdle. B. iv. C. 5. St. 3. That girdle gave the virtue of chaste love And wivehoood true to all that did it beare; But whosoever contrarie doth prove, Might not the same about her middle weare, But it would loose or else asunder teare. So it happened to the false Florimel, st. 16, when —Being brought, about her middle small They thought to gird, as best it her became, But by no means they could it thereto frame, For ever as they fastned it, it loos'd And fell away, as feeling secret blame, &amp;c. That all men wondred at the uncouth sight And each one thought as to their fancies came. But she herself did think it done for spight, And touched was with secret wrath and shame Therewith, as thing deviz'd her to defame: Then many other ladies likewise tride About their tender loynes to knit the same, But it would not on none of them abide, But when they thought it fast, eftsoones it was untide. Thereat all knights gan laugh and ladies lowre, Till that at last the gentle Amoret Likewise assayed to prove that girdle's powre. And having it about her middle set Did find it fit withouten breach or let, Whereat the rest gan greatly to envie. But Florimel exceedingly did fret And snatching from her hand, &amp;c. As for the trial of the Horne, it is not peculiar to our Poet: It occurs in the old romance, intitled Morte Arthur, which was translated out of French in the time of K. Edw. IV. and first printed anno 1484. From that romance Ariosto is thought to have borrowed his tale of the Enchanted Cup, C. 42. &amp;c. See Mr. Warton's Observations on the Faerie Queen, &amp;c. The story of the Horn in Morte Arthur varies a good deal from this of our Poet, as the reader will judge from the following extract.—“By the way they met with a knight that was sent from Morgan le Faye to king Arthur, and this knight had a fair horne all garnished with gold, and the horne had such a virtue that there might no ladye or gentlewoman drinke of that horne, but if she were true to her husband: and if shee were false she should spill all the drinke, and if shee were true unto her lorde, shee might drink peaceably: and because of queene Guenever and in despite of Sir Launcelot du Lake, this horne was sent unto king Arthur.”—This born is intercepted and brought unto another king named Marke, who is not a whit more fortunate than the British hero, for he makes “his queene drinke thereof and an hundred ladies moe, and there were but foure ladies of all those that drank cleane” of which number the said queen, proves not to be one [Book II. chap. 22. Ed. 1632.] In other respects the two stories are so different, that we have just reason to suppose this Ballad was written before that romance was translated into English. As for queen Guènever, she is here represented no otherwise, than as we find her in old histories and romances. Holinshed observes, that “she was evil reported of, as noted of incontinence and breach of faith to hir husband.” Vol. I. p. 93. Such Readers, as have no relish for pure antiquity, will find a more modern copy of this Ballad at the end of the volume. In the third day of may, To Carleile did come A kind curteous child, That cold much of wisdome. A kirtle and a mantle This child had uppon, With ‘brooches’ and ringes Branches, MS. Full richelye bedone. He had a sute of silke About his middle drawne; Without he cold of curtesye heate, MS. He thought itt much shame. God speede thee, king Arthur, Sitting at thy meate: And the goodly queene Guénever, I cannott her forgett. I tell you, lords, in this hall; I hett you all to ‘heede’; Except you be the more surer Is for you to dread. He plucked out of his poterver, or potewer. And longer wold not dwell, He pulled forth a pretty mantle, Betweene two nut-shells. Have thou here, king Arthur; Have thou heere of mee: Give itt to thy comely queene Shapen as itt is alreadye. It shall never become that wiffe, That hath once done amisse. Then every knight in the king's court Began to care for ‘his.’ his wiffe. MS. Forth came dame Guénever; To the mantle shee her ‘hied’; The ladye shee was newfangle, But yett she was affrayd. When shee had taken the mantle; She stoode as she had beene madd: It was from the top to the toe As sheeres had itt shread. One while was it ‘gule’; gaule. MS. Another while was itt greene; Another while was itt wadded: Ill itt did her beseeme. Another while was itt blacke, And bore the worst hue: By my troth, quoth king Arthur, I thinke thou be not true. Shee threw downe the mantle, That bright was of blee; Fast with a rudd redd, To her chamber can shee flee. She curst the weaver, and the walker, That clothe that had wrought; And bade a vengeance on his crowne, That hither hath itt brought. I had rather be in a wood, Under a green tree; Than in king Arthur's court Shamed for to bee. Kay called forth his ladye, And bade her come neere; Saies, Madam, and thou be guiltye, I pray thee hold thee there. Forth came his ladye Shortlye and anon; Boldlye to the mantle Then is shee gone. When she had tane the mantle, And cast it her about; Then was she bare ‘Before all the rout.” Then every knight, That was in the king's court, Talked, laughed, and showted Full oft at that sport. Shee threw downe the mantle, That bright was of blee; Fast, with a red rudd, To her chamber can she flee. Forth came an old knight Pattering ore a creede, And he proferred to this litle boy Twenty markes to his meede; And all the time of the Christmasse Willinglye to ffeede; For why this mantle might Do his wiffe some need. When she had tane the mantle, Of cloth that was made, She had no more left on her, But a tassel and a threed: Then every knight in the kings court Bade evill might shee speed. Shee threw downe the mantle, That bright was of blee; And fast, with a redd rudd, To her chamber can shee flee. Craddocke called forth his ladye, And bade her come in; Saith, winne this mantle, ladye, With a little dinne. Winne this mantle, ladye, And it shal be thine, If thou never did amisse Since thou wast mine. Forth came Craddocke's ladye Shortlye and anon; But boldlye to the mantle Then is shee gone. When shee had tane the mantle, And cast itt her about, Upp att her great toe It began to crinkle and crowt: Shee said, bowe downe, mantle, And shame me not for nought. Once I did amisse, I tell you certainlye, When I kist Craddocke's mouth Under a greene tree; When I kist Craddockes mouth Before he marryed mee. When shee had her shreeven, And her sinnes shee had tolde; The mantle stoode about her Right as shee wold: Seemelye of coulour Glittering like gold: Then every knight in Arthurs court Did her behold. Then spake dame Guénever To Arthur our king; She hath tane yonder mantle Not with right, but with wronge. See you not yonder woman, That maketh her self ‘cleane’? cleare, MS. I have seene tane out of her bedd Of men five teene; Priests, clarkes, and wedded men by deene. MS. From her bedeene: Yett shee taketh the mantle, And maketh her self cleane. Then spake the litle boy, That kept the mantle in hold; Sayes, king, chasten thy wiffe, Of her words shee is too bold: Shee is a bitch and a witch, And a whore bold: King, in thine owne hall, Thou art a cuckold. The litle boy stoode Looking out a dore; ‘And there as he was lookinge ‘He was ware of a wyld bore.’ He was ware of a wyld bore, Wold have werryed a man: He pulled forth a wood kniffe, Fast thither that he ran: He brought in the bores head, And quitted him like a man. He brought in the bores head, And was wonderous bold: He said there were never a cuckolds kniffe Carve itt that cold. Some rubbed their knives Uppon a whetstone: Some threw them under the table, And said they had none. King Arthur, and the child Stood looking upon them; them upon. MS. All their knives edges Turned backe againe. Craddocke had a litle knive Of iron and of steele; He britled the bores head Wonderous weele; That every knight in the kings court Had a morsell. The litle boy had a horne, Of red gold that ronge: He said, there was noe cuckolde Shall drinke of my horne; But he shold itt sheede Either behind or beforne. Some shedd on their shoulder, And some on their knee; He that cold not hitt his mouthe, Put it in his eye: And he that was a cuckold Every man might him see. Craddocke wan the horne, And the bores head: His ladie wan the mantle Unto her meede. Everye such lovely ladye God send her well to speede. II. THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE —Is chiefly taken from the fragment of an old ballad in the Editor's MS. which he has reason to believe more ancient than the time of Chaucer, and what furnished that bard with his Wise of Bath's Tale. The original was so extremely mutilated, half of every leaf being torn away, that without large supplements, &amp;c. it would have been improper for this collection: these it has therefore received, such as they are. They are not here particularly pointed out, because the Fragment itself will some time or other be given to the public. Part the First. King Arthur lives in merry Carleile, And seemely is to see; And there with him queene Guenever, That bride soe bright of blee. And there with him queene Guenever, That bride so bright in bowre: And all his barons about him stoode, That were both stiffe and stowre. The king a royale Christmasse kept, With mirth and princelye cheare; To him repaired many a knighte, That came both farre and neare. And when they were to dinner sette, And cups went freely round; Before them came a faire damsèlle, And knelt upon the ground. A boone, a boone, O kinge Arthùre, I beg a boone of thee; Avenge me of a carlish knighte, Who hath shent my love and mee. In Tearne-Wadling his castle stands, All on a hill soe hye, And proudlye rise the battlements, And gaye the streameres flye. Noe gentle knighte, nor ladye faire, May pass that castle-walle: But from that foule discurteous knighte, Mishappe will them befalle. Hee's twyce the size of common men, Wi' thewes, and sinewes stronge, And on his backe he bears a clubbe, That is both thicke and longe. This grimme baròne 'twas our harde happe, But yester morne to see; When to his bowre he bore my love, And sore misused mee. And when I told him, king Arthùre As lyttle shold him spare; Goe tell, sayd hee, that cuckold kinge, To meete mee if he dare. Upp then sterted king Arthùre, And sware by hille and dale, He ne'er wolde quitt that grimme baròne, Till he had made him quail. Goe fetch my sword Excalibar: Goe saddle mee my steede; Nowe, by my faye, that grimme baròne Shall rue this ruthfulle deede. And when he came to Tearne Wadlinge Benethe the castle walle: “Come forth; come forth; thou proude baròne, Or yielde thyself my thralle.” On magicke grounde that castle stoode, And fenc'd with many a spelle: Noe valiant knighte could tread thereon, But straite his courage felle. Forth then rush'd that carlish knight, King Arthur felte the charme: His sturdy sinewes lost their strengthe, Downe sunke his feeble arme. Nowe yield thee, yield thee, kinge Arthùre, Now yield thee, unto mee: Or fighte with mee, or lose thy lande, Noe better termes maye bee. Unlesse thou sweare upon the rood, And promise on thy faye, Here to returne to Tearne Wadling, Upon the new-yeare's daye: And bringe me worde what thing it is All women moste desyre: This is thy ransome, Arthur, he sayes, Ile have noe other hyre. King Arthur then helde up his hande, And sware upon his faye, Then tooke his leave of the grimme barone And faste hee rode awaye. And he rode east, and he rode west, And did of all inquyre, What thing it is all women crave, And what they most desyre. Some told him riches, pompe, or state; Some rayment fine and brighte; Some told him mirthe; some flatterye; And some a jollye knighte. In letteres all king Arthur wrote, And seal'd them with his ringe: But still his minde was helde in doubte, Each tolde a different thinge. As ruthfulle he rode over a more, He saw a ladye sette Betweene an oke, and a greene holléye, All clad in red So the Original. scarlette. Her nose was crookt and turnd outwàrde, Her chin stoode all awrye; And where as sholde have been her mouthe, Lo! there was set her eye: Her haires, like serpents, clung aboute Her cheekes of deadlye hewe: A worse-form'd ladye than she was, No man mote ever viewe. To hail the king in seemelye sorte This ladye was fulle saine; But king Arthùre all sore amaz'd, No aunswere made againe. What wight art thou, the ladye sayd, That wilt not speake to mee; Sir, I may chance to ease thy paine, Though I bee foule to see. If thou wilt ease my paine, he sayd, And helpe me in my neede; Ask what thou wilt, thou grimme ladyè, And it shall bee thy meede. O sweare mee this upon the roode, And promise on thy faye; And here the secrette I will telle, That shall thy ransome paye. King Arthur promis'd on his faye, And sware upon the roode; The secrette then the ladye told, As lightlye well shee cou'de. Now this shall be my paye, sir king, And this my guerdon bee, That some yong, fair and courtlye knight, Thou bringe to marrye mee. Fast then pricked king Arthùre Ore hille, and dale, and downe: And soone he founde the barone's bowre; And soone the grimme baroùne. He bare his clubbe upon his backe, Hee stoode bothe stiffe and stronge; And, when he had the letters reade, Awaye the lettres flunge. Nowe yielde thee, Arthur, and thy lands, All forfeit unto mee; For this is not thy paye, sir king, Nor may thy ransome bee. Yet hold thy hand, thou proude baròne, I praye thee hold thy hand; And give mee leave to speake once moe In reskewe of my land. This morne, as I came over a more, I saw a ladye sette Betwene an oke, and a greene hollèye, All clad in red scarlètte. Shee sayes, all women will have their wille, This is their chief desyre; Now yield, as thou art a barone true, That I have payd mine hyre. An earlye vengeaunce light on her! The carlish baron swore: Shee was my sister tolde thee this, And shee's a mishapen whore. But here I will make mine avowe, To do her as ill a turne: For an ever I may that foule theefe gette, In a fyre I will her burne. Part the Seconde. Homewarde pricked king Arthùre, And a wearye man was hee; And soone he mette queene Guenever, That bride so bright of blee. What newes! what newes! thou noble king, Howe, Arthur, hast thou sped? Where hast thou hung the carlish knighte? And where bestow'd his head? The carlish knight is safe for mee, And free fro mortal harme: On magicke grounde his castle stands, And fenc'd with many a charme. To bowe to him I was fulle faine, And yielde mee to his hand: And but for a lothly ladye, there I sholde have lost my land. And nowe this fills my hearte with woe, And sorrowe of my life; I swore a yonge and courtlye knight, Sholde marry her to his wife. Then bespake him sir Gawàine, That was ever a gentle knighte: That lothly ladye I will wed; Therefore be merrye and lighte. Nowe naye, nowe naye, good sir Gawàine; My sister's sonne yee bee; This lothlye ladye's all too grimme, And all too foule for yee. Her nose is crookt and turn'd outwàrde; Her chin stands all awrye; A worse form'd ladye than shee is Was never seen with eye. What though her chin stand all awrye, And shee be foule to see: I'll marry her, unkle, for thy sake, And I'll thy ransome bee. Nowe thankes, nowe thankes, good sir Gawàine; And a blessing thee betyde! To-morrow wee'll have knights and squires, And wee'll goe fetch thy bride. And wee'll have hawkes and wee'll have houndes, To cover our intent; And wee'll away to the greene forèst, As wee a hunting went. Sir Lancelot, sir Stephen bolde, They rode with them that daye; And foremoste of the companye There rode the stewarde Kaye: Soe did sir Banier and sir Bore, And eke sir Garratte keene; Sir Tristram too, that gentle knight, To the forest freshe and greene. And when they came to the greene forrèst, Beneathe a faire holley tree There sate that ladye in red scarlètte That unseemelye was to see. Sir Kay beheld that lady's face, And looked upon her sweere; Whoever kisses that ladye, he sayes Of his kisse he stands in feare. Sir Kay beheld that ladye againe, And looked upon her snout; Whoever kisses that ladye, he sayes, Of his kisse he stands in doubt. Peace, brother Kay, sayde sir Gawàine, And amend thee of thy life: For there is a knight amongst us all, Must marry her to his wife. What marry this foule queane, quoth Kay, I'the devil's name anone; Get mee a wife wherever I maye, In sooth shee shall bee none. Then some tooke up their hawkes in haste, And some took up their houndes; And sayd they wolde not marry her, For cities, nor for townes. Then bespake him king Arthùre, And sware there by this daye; For a little foule sighte and mislikìnge, Yee shall not say her naye. Peace, lordings, peace: sir Gawaine sayd, Nor make debate and strife; This lothlye ladye I will take, And marry her to my wife. Nowe thankes, now thankes, good sir Gawaine, And a blessinge be thy meede! For as I am thine owne ladyè, Thou never shalt rue this deede. Then up they took that lothly dame, And home anone they bringe: And there sir Gawaine he her wed, And married her with a ringe. And when they were in wed-bed laid, And all were done awaye; Come turne to mee, mine owne wed-lord Come turne to mee I praye. Sir Gawaine scant could lift his head, For sorrowe and for care; When, lo! instead of that lothelye dame, Hee sawe a young ladye faire. Sweet blushes stayn'd her rud-red cheeke, Her eyen were blacke as sloe: The ripening cherrye swellde her lippe, And all her necke was snowe. Sir Gawaine kiss'd that lady faire, Lying upon the sheete: And swore, as he was a true knighte, The spice was never soe sweete. Sir Gawaine kiss'd that lady brighte, Lying there by his side: “The fairest flower is not soe faire; Thou never can'st bee my bride.” I am thy bride, mine owne deare lorde, The same whiche thou didst knowe, That was soe lothlye, and was wont Upon the wild more to goe. Nowe, gentle Gawaine, chuse, quoth shee, And make thy choice with care; Whether by night, or else by daye, Shall I be foule or faire? “To have thee foule still in the night, When I with thee should playe! I had rather farre, my lady deare, To have thee foule by daye.” What when gaye ladyes goe with their lordes To drinke the ale and wine; Alas! then I must hide myself, I must not goe with mine? “My faire ladyè, sir Gawaine sayd, I yield me to thy skille; Because thou art mine owne ladyè Thou shalt have all thy wille.” Nowe blessed be thou, sweete Gawàine, And the daye that I thee see; For as thou seest mee at this time, Soe shall I ever bee. My father was an aged knighte, And yet it chanced soe, He tooke to wife a false ladyè, Whiche broughte me to this woe. Shee witch'd mee, being a faire yonge maide, In the greene forèst to dwelle; And there to abide in lothlye shape, Most like a fiend of helle. Midst mores and mosses; woods, and wilds; To lead a lonesome life: Till some yong faire and courtlye knighte Wolde marrye me to his wife: Nor fully to gaine mine owne trewe shape, Such was her devilish skille; Until he wolde yielde to be rul'd by mee, And let mee have all my wille. She witchd my brother to a carlish boore, And made him stiffe and stronge; And built him a bowre on magicke grounde, To live by rapine and wronge. But now the spelle is broken throughe, And wronge is turnde to righte; Henceforth I shall bee a faire ladyè, And hee be a gentle knighte. III. KING RYENCE'S CHALLENGE. This song is more modern than many of those which follow it, but is placed here for the sake of the subject. It was sung before queene Elizabeth at the grand entertainment at Kenelworth-castle in 1575, and was probably composed for that occasion. In a letter describing those festivities, it is thus mentioned; “A minstral came forth with a sollem song, warranted for story out of K. Arthur's acts, whereof I gat a copy, and is this; So it fell out on a Pentecost &amp;c.” After the song the narrative proceeds: “At this the Minstrell made a pause and a curtezy for primus passus. More of the song is thear, but I gatt it not.” The story in Morte Arthur, whence it is taken, runs as follows, Came a messenger hastely from king Ryence of North-Wales,—saying, that king Ryence had discomfited and overcomen eleaven kings, and everiche of them did him homage, and that was this; they gave him their beards cleane flayne off, wherefore the messenger came for king Arthur's beard, for king Ryence had purfeled a mantell with kings beards, and there lacked for one place of the mantell, wherefore he sent for his beard, or else he would enter into his lands, and brenn and slay, and never leave till he have thy head and thy beard. Well, said king Arthur, thou bast said thy message, which is the most villainous and lewdest message that ever man heard sent to a king. Also thou mayest see my beard is full young yet for to make a purfell of, but tell thou the king that—or it be long he shall do to me homage on both his knees, or else he shall leese his head.” [B. 1. c. 24. See also the same Romance, B. 1. c. 92.] The thought seems to be originally taken from Jeff. Monmouth's hist. B. 10. c. 3. which is alluded to by Drayton in his Poly-Olb. Song 4. and by Spencer in Faer. Qu. 6. 1. 13. 15. See the Observations on Spenser, vol. 2. p. 223. The following text is composed of the best readings selected from three different copies. The first in Enderbie's Cambria Triumphans, p. 197. The second in the Letter abovementioned. And the third inserted in MS. in a copy of Morte Arthur, 1632, in the Bodl. Library. “Stow tells us, that king Arthur kept his round table at “diverse places, but especially at Carlion, Winchester, and Camalet in Somersetshire. This Camelet sometimes a famous towne or castle, is situate on a very high tor or hill, &amp;c.” [See an exact description in Stowe's Annals, Ed. 1631. p. 55.] As it fell out on a Pentecost day, King Arthur at Camelot kept his court royall, With his faire queene dame Guenever the gay; And many bold barons sitting in hall; With ladies attired in purple and pall; And heraults in hewkes, hooting on high, Cryed, Largesse, Largesse, Chevaliers tres-hardie. Largesse, Largesse, The heralds resounded these words as oft as they received of the bounty of the knights. See “Memoires de la Chevalerie.” tom. p. 1. 99.—The expression is still used in the form of installing knights of the garter. A doughty dwarfe to the uppermost deas Right pertlye gan pricke, kneeling on knee, With steven fulle stoute amids all the preas, Sayd, Nowe sir king Arthur, God save thee, and see! Sir Ryence of North-gales greeteth well thee, And bids thee thy beard anon to him send, Or else from thy jaws he will it off rend. For his robe of state is a rich scarlet mantle, With eleven kings beards bordered Perhaps 'broidered: so “purfelled” signifies. about, And there is room lefte yet in a kantle, For thine to stande, to make the twelfth out: This must be done, be thou never so stout; This must be done, I tell thee no fable, Maugre the teethe of all thy round table. When this mortal message from his mouthe past, Great was the noyse bothe in hall and in bower: The king fum'd; the queene screecht; ladies were aghast; Princes puffd; barons blustred; lords began lower; Knights stormed; squires startled, like steeds in a stower; Pages and yeomen yell'd out in the hall, Then in came sir Kay, the ‘king's’ seneschal. Silence, my soveraignes, quoth this courteous knight, And in that stound the stowre began still: ‘Then’ the dwarfe's dinner full deerely was dight, Of wine and wassel he had his wille; And, when he had eaten and drunken his fill, An hundred pieces of fine coyned gold Were given this dwarf for his message bold. But say to sir Ryence, thou dwarf, quoth the king, That for his bold message I do him defye; And shortlye with basins and pans will him ring Out of North-gales; where he and I With swords, and not razors, quickly shall trye, Whether he, or king Arthur will prove the best barbor: And therewith he shook his good sword Excalàbor. IV. KING ARTHUR's DEATH. A Fragment. The subject of this ballad is evidently taken from the old romance Morte Arthur, but with some variations, especially in the concluding stanzas; in which the author seems rather to follow the traditions of the old Welsh Bards, who “believed that King Arthur was not dead, but conveied awaie by the Fairies into some pleasant place, where he should remaine for a time, and then returne againe and reign in as great authority as ever.” Holingshed. B. 5. c. 14. or as it is expressed in an old Chronicle printed at Antwerp 1493 by Ger. de Leew, “The Bretons supposen, that he [K. Arthur]—shall come yet and conquere all Bretaigne, for certes this is the prophicye of Merlyn: He sayd, that his deth shall be doubteous; and sayd soth, for men thereof yet have doubte, and shullen for ever more,—for men wyt not whether that he lyveth or is dede.” See more ancient testimonies in Selden's Notes on Polyolbion, Song III. This fragment being very incorrect and imperfect in the original MS. hath received some conjectural emendations, and even a supplement of 3 or 4 stanzas composed from the romance of Morte Arthur. On Trinitye Mondaye in the morne, This sore battayle was doom'd to bee; Where manye a knighte cry'd, Well-awaye! Alacké, it was the more pittìe. Ere the first crowinge of the cocke, When as the kinge in his bed laye, He thoughte sir Gawaine to him came, And there to him these wordes did saye. Nowe as you are mine unkle deare, And as you prize your life, this daye O meet not with your foe in fighte; Putt off the battayle, if yee maye. For sir Launcelot is nowe in Fraunce, And with him many an hardye knighte: Who will within this moneth be backe, And will assiste yee in the fighte. The kinge then call'd his nobles all, Before the breakinge of the daye; And tolde them howe sir Gawaine came, And there to him these wordes did saye. His nobles all this counsayle gave, That earlye in the morning, hee Shold send awaye an herauld at armes, To aske a parley faire and free. Then twelve good knightes king Arthure chose, The best of all that with him were: To parley with the foe in field, And make with him agreement faire. The king he charged all his hoste, In readinesse there for to bee: But noe man sholde noe weapon sturre, Unlesse a sword drawne they shold see. And Mordred on the other parte, Twelve of his knights did likewise bringe; The beste of all his companye, To hold the parley with the kinge. Sir Mordred alsoe charged his hoste, In readinesse there for to bee; But noe man sholde noe weapon sturre, But if a sworde drawne they shold see. For he durste not his unkle truste, Nor he his nephewe, sothe to tell: Alacke! it was a woefulle case, As ere in Christentye befelle. But when they were together mette, And both to faire accordance broughte; And a month's league betweene them sette, Before the battayle sholde be foughte. An addere crept forth of a bushe, Stunge one o'th' king's knightes on the knee: Alacke! it was a woefulle chance, As ever was in Christentìe. When the knighte found him wounded sore, And sawe the wild-worme hanginge there; His sworde he from his scabberde drewe: A piteous case as ye shall heare. For when the two hostes sawe the sworde, They joyned battayle instantlye; Till of soe manye noble knightes, On one side there were left but three. For all were slain that durst abide, And but some fewe that fled awaye: Ay mee! it was a bloodye fielde, As ere was foughte on summer's daye. Upon king Arthur's own partyè, Onlye himselfe escaped there, And Lukyn duke of Gloster free, And the king's butler Bedevere. And when the king beheld his knightes, All dead and scattered on the molde; The teares fast trickled downe his face; That manlye face in fight so bolde. Nowe reste yee all, brave knights, he said, Soe true and faithful to your trust: And must yee then, ye valiant hearts, Be lefte to moulder into dust! Most loyal have yee been to mee, Most true and faithful unto deathe: And, oh! to rayse yee up againe, How freelye could I yield my breathe? But see the traitor's yet alive, Lo where hee stalkes among the deade! Nowe bitterlye he shall abye: And vengeance fall upon his head. O staye, my liege, then sayd the duke; O staye for love and charitìe; Remember what the vision spake, Nor meete your foe, if it may bee. O, staye mee not, thou worthye wight, This debt my loyal knights I owe: Betide me life, betide me death, I will avenge them of their foe. Then straite he grasp'd his trustye speare, And on his horse then mounted hee: As his butler holpe him to his horse, His bowels gushed to his knee. Alas! then sayd the noble king, That I should live this sight to see! To see this good knight here be slaine, All for his love in helping mee! He put his speare into his reste, And to sir Mordred loud gan crye; Nowe sette thyself upon thy guarde, For, traitor, nowe thy death is nye. Sir Mordred lifted up his sworde, And fierce to meet the king ran hee: The king his speare he through him thrust; A fathom thorow his bodìe. When Mordered felt the stroke of death, And found that he was wounded soe; He thruste himselfe upon the speare, And strucke the king a deadlye blowe. Then grimmlye dyed sir Mordered, Presentlye upon that tree: And bloody streames ranne from the kinge, Ere to the duke returned hee. Sir Lukyn then he thus bespake, Sir knighte, thou hast been faithfulle tryde, Nowe take my sword Excalibar, That hangs so freelye by my syde. O take my sword Excalibar, And there into the river throwe: For here, henceforth, benethe this tree, All use of weapons I foregoe. And fare thee well, thou trustye sword, A better neer had valiant knighte, With thee full ofte, and manye a daye, Have I withstood my foe in fighte. With this good fauchion in my hande, Oft have I reapd the bloody feelde: But nowe the fatalle houre is come, That never more I may thee weelde. The duke then to the river went, And there his owne sword in threwe hee: But he kept back Excalibar, He kept it back in privitee. For all of coleyne was the blade; And all the hilte of precious stone: And ever alacke! then sayd the knighte, Must such a sword awaye be throwne? Then backe he came unto the kinge, Who sayd, Sir Lukyn, what did yee see? Nothing, my liege, save that the winde Blewe oer the waters faire and free. O goe againe, then said the kinge, O good fir Lukyn, goe againe: Into the rivere throwe my sword, Nor keepe me lingering here in paine. The duke then to the river went, And the kings scabberd in threwe hee; But hee kept backe Excalibar, And hid it undernethe a tree. Then backe he came to tell the kinge, Who sayde, Sir Lukyn sawe ye oughte? Nothinge, my liege, save that the winde Nowe with the angrye waters fought. O Lukyn, Lukyn, said the kinge, Twice haste thou dealt deceytfullye: Alacke, whom may wee ever truste, When suche a knighte soe false can bee? Saye, wouldst thou have thy master dead; All for a sword, that wins thine eye: Nowe goe againe, and throwe it in, Or here the tone of us shall dye. The duke, all shent with this rebuke, No aunswere made unto the kinge: But to the rivere tooke the sworde, And threwe it far as he coulde flinge. A hande and an arme did meete the sworde, And flourishd three times in the air; Then funke benethe the renninge streme, And of the duke was seene noe mair. All sore astonied stood the duke; He stood as still, as still mote bee: Then hastend backe to telle the kinge; But he was gone from benethe the tree. Unto what place he colde not telle, For never after he did him spye: see MS. But hee sawe a barge goe from the lande, And hee heard ladyes howle and crye. Not unlike that passage in Virgil. Summoque ulularunt vertice nymphæ. Ladies was the word our old English writers used for Nymphs: As in the following lines of an old song in the Editor's MS collection. “When scorching Phœbus he did mount, “Then Lady Venus went to hunt: “To whom Diana did resort, “With all the Ladyes of hills, and valleys, “Of springs, and floodes, &amp;c. And whether the kinge were there, or not, Hee never knewe, nor ever colde: For from that sad and direfulle daye, Hee never more was seene on molde. V. THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR. We have here a short summary of K. Arthur's History as given by Jeff. of Monmouth and the old chronicles, with the addition of a few circumstances from the romance Morte Arthur.—The ancient chronicle of Ger. de Leew, (quoted above in p. 28.) seems to have been chiefly followed: upon the authority of which we have restored some of the names which were corrupted in the MS. and have transposed one stanza, which appeared to be misplaced. [viz. that beginning at v. 49. which in the MS. followed v. 36.] Printed from the Editor's ancient manuscript. Of Brutus' blood, in Brittaine borne, Bruite his. MS. King Arthur I am to name; Through Christendome, and Heathynesse, Well knowne is my worthy fame. In Jesus Christ I doe beleeve; I am a christyan bore: The Father, Sone, and Holy Gost One God, I doe adore.

For there my nephew sir Gawaine dyed, Being wounded in that sore, The whiche sir Lancelot in fight Had given him before.

A. 25.] intitled, “Divers things of Hen. viij's time.” Who sekes to tame the blustering winde, Or causse the floods bend to his wyll, Or els against dame natures kinde To ‘change’ things frame by cunning skyll: causse, MS. That man I thinke bestoweth paine, Thoughe that his laboure be in vaine. Who strives to breake the sturdye steele, Or goeth about to staye the sunne; Who thinks to causse an oke to reele, Which never can by force be done: That man likewise bestoweth paine, Thoughe that his laboure be in vaine. Who thinks to stryve against the streame, And for to sayle without a maste; Unlesse he thinks perhapps to faine, His travell ys forelorne and waste; And so in cure of all his paine, His travell'ys his cheffest gaine. So he lykewise, that goes about To please eche eye and every eare, Had nede to have withouten doubt A golden gyft with hym to beare; For evyll report shall be his gaine, Though he bestowe both toyle and paine. God grant eche man one to amend; God send us all a happy place; And let us pray unto the end, That we may have our princes grace: Amen, amen! so shall we gaine A dewe reward for all our paine. VII. GLASGERION. An ingenious Friend thinks that the following old Dity (which is printed from the Editor's MS. Collection) may possibly have given birth to the Tragedy of the Orphan, in which Polidore intercepts Monimia's intended favours to Castalio. Glasgerion was a kinges owne sonne, And a harper he was goode: He harped in the kinges chambere, Where cuppe and caudle stoode. And soe did he in the queenes chambere, Till ladyes waxed glad. wood. MS. And then bespake the kinges daughter; These were the wordes she sayd. Strike on, strike on, Glasgèrion, Of thy striking doe not blinne: Theres never a stroke comes oer thy harpe, But it glads my harte withinne. Faire might he fall, ladye, quoth hee, Who taught you nowe to speake! I have loved you, ladye, seven longe yeare My minde I never durst breake. harte. MS. But come to my bower, my Glasgeriòn, When all men are att rest: As I am a ladye true of my promise, Thou shalt bee a welcome guest. Home then came Glasgèrion, A glad man, lord! was hee. And, come thou hither, Jacke my boy; Come hither unto mee. For the kinges daughter of Normandye Hath granted mee my boone: And att her chambere must I bee Beffore the cocke have crowen. O master, master, then quoth hee, Lay your head heere on this stone: For I will waken you, master deare, Afore it be time to gone. But up then rose that lither ladd, And hose and shoone did on: A coller he cast upon his necke, He seemed a gentleman. And when he came to the ladyes chambere, He thrilled upon a pinn. The lady was true of her promise, And rose and lett him in. He did not take the lady gaye To boulster nor to bed: ‘Nor thoughe hee had his wicked wille, ‘A single word he sed. He did not kisse that ladyes mouthe, Nor when he came, nor yode: And sore that ladye did mistrust He was of some churls blode. But home then came that lither ladd, And did off his hole and shoone; And cast the coller from off his necke: He was but a churlès sonne. Awake, awake, my deere master, The cock hath well-nigh crowen. Awake, awake, my master deere, I hold it time to be gone. For I have saddled your horse, master, Well bridled I have your steede: And I have served you a good breakfast: For thereof ye have need. Up then rose, good Glasgeriòn, And did on hose and shoone; And cast a coller about his necke: For he was a kinge his sonne. And when he came to the ladyes chambere, He thrilled upon the pinne: The ladye was more than true of promise, And rose and let him inn. O whether have you left with me Your bracelet or your glove? Or are you returned backe againe To know more of my love? Glasgèrion swore a full great othe, By oake, and ashe, and thorne; Ladye, I was never in your chambère, Sith the time that I was borne. O then it was your lither foot-page, little. MS. He hath beguiled mee. Then shee pulled forth a little pen-knìffe, That hanged by her knee. Sayes, there shall never noe churlès blood Within my bodye spring: No churlès blood shall eer defile The daughter of a kinge. Home then went Glasgèrion, And woe, good lord, was hee. Sayes, come thou hither, Jacke my boy, Come hither unto mee. If I had killed a man to night, Jacke, I would tell it thee: But if I have not killed a man to night Jacke, thou hast killed three. And he pulled out his bright browne sworde, And dryed it on his sleeve, And he smote off that lither ladds head, Who did his ladye grieve. He sett the swords poynt till his brest, The pummil untill a stone: Throw the falsenesse of that lither ladd, These three lives all were gone. werne all. MS. VIII. OLD SIR ROBIN OF PORTINGALE. From an ancient copy in the Editor's MS collection. Let never again soe old a man Marrye soe yonge a wife, As did old ‘sir’ Robin of Portingale; Who may rue all the dayes of his life. For the mayors daughter of Lin, god wott, He chose her to his wife, And thought with her to have lived in love, But they fell to hate and strife. They scarce were in their wed-bed laid, And scarce was hee asleepe, But upp she rose, and forth shee goes, To the steward, and gan to weepe. Sleepe you, wake you, faire sir Gyles? Or be you not withinn? Sleepe you, wake you, faire sir Gyles, Arise and let me inn. O, I am waking, sweete, he said, Sweete ladye, what is your wille? I have bethought me of a wyle unbethought. MS. How my wed-lord weell spille. Twenty-four good knights, shee sayes, That dwell about this towne, Even twenty-four of my near cozèns, Shall helpe to ding him downe. All this beheard his litle footepage, As he watered his masters steed; And for his masters sad perìlle His verry heart did bleed. He mourned, sighed, and wept full sore: I sweare by the holy roode The teares he for his master wept Were blent water and bloode. blend. MS. All that beheard his deare mastèr As he stood at his garden pale: Sayes, Ever alacke, my litle foot-page, What causes thee to wail? Hath any one done to thee wronge Any of thy fellowes here? Or is any ‘one’ of thy good friends dead, That thou shedst manye a teare? Or if it be my head bookes-man, Aggrieved he shal bee: For no man here within my howse, Shall doe wrong unto thee. O, it is not your head bookes-man, Nor none of his degree: But ‘on’ to-morrow ere it be noone or. MS. All doomed to die are yee. deemed. MS. And of that bethank your head stewàrd, And thank your gay ladèe. If this be true, my litle foot-page, The heyre of my land thoust bee. If it be not true, my dear mastèr, No good death let me die. If it bee not true, thou litle foot-page, A dead corse shalt thou lie. bee. MS. O call now downe my faire ladye, O call her downe to mee: And tell my ladye gay how sicke, And like to die I bee. Downe then came his ladye faire, All clad in purple and pall: The rings that were on her fingèrs, Cast light throughout the hall. What is your will, my owne wed-lord? What is your will with mee? O see, my ladye deere, how sicke, And like to die I bee. And thou be sicke, my own wed-lord, Soe sore it grieveth mee: But my five maydens and myselfe Will make the bedde for thee: And at the waking of your first sleepe, We will a hot drinke make: And at the waking of your first sleepe, Your sorrowes we will slake. He put a silk cote on his backe, And mail of manye a fold: And hee putt a steele cap on his head, Was gilt with good red gold. He layd a bright browne sword by his side, And another att his feete: And twentye good knights he placed at hand, To watch him in his sleepe. And about the middle time of the night, Came twentye-four traitours inn: Sir Giles he was the foremost man, The leader of that ginn. The old knight with his bright browne sword, Sir Gyles head soon did winn: And scant of all those twenty-foure, Went out one quick agenn. None save only a litle foot page, Crept forth at a window of stone: And he had two armes when he came in, And he went back with one. Upp then came that ladie gaye With torches burning bright: She thought to have brought sir Gyles a drinke, Butt she found her owne wedd knight. The first thinge that she stumbled on It was sir Gyles his foote: Sayes, Ever alacke, and woe is mee! Here lyes my sweete hart-roote. The next thinge that she stumbled on It was sir Gyles his heade: Sayes, Ever, alacke, and woe is me! Heere lyes my true love deade. Hee cutt the pappes beside her brest, And did her body spille; He cutt the eares beside her heade, And bade her love her fille. He called then up his litle foot-page, And made him there his heyre; And sayd henceforth my worldlye goodes And countrye I forsweare. He shope the crosse on his right shouldèr, Of the white ‘clothe’ and the redde Every person, who went on a Croisade to the Holy Land, usually wore a cross on his upper garment, on the right shoulder, as a badge of his profession. Different nations were distinguished by crosses of different colours: The English wore white; the French red; &amp;c. This circumstance seems to be confounded in the ballad. [Vide Spelmanns Glossar. Chambers Dict. &amp;c.], fleshe. MS. And went him into the holy land, Whereas Christ was quicke and deade. IX. CHILD WATERS. Child is frequently used by our old writers, as a Title. It is repeatedly given to Prince Arthur in the Fairie Queen: and the son of a king is in the same poem called Child Tristram. [B. 5. c. 11. st. 8. 13.—B. 6. c. 2. st. 36.—Ibid. c. 8. st. 15.] In an old ballad quoted in Shakespeare's K. Lear, the hero of Ariosto is called Child Roland. Mr. Theobald supposes this use of the word received along with their romances from the Spaniards, with whom Infante signifies a Prince. A more eminent critic tells us, that “in the old times of chivalry, the noble youth, who were candidates for knighthood, during the time of their probation were called Infans, Varlets, Damoysels, Bacheliers. The most noble of the youth were particularly called Infans.” [Vid. Warb. Shakesp.] A late commentator on Spenser observes, that the Saxon word cnihz knight, signifies also a Child. [See Upton's gloss to the F. Q.] The Editor's MS. collection, whence the following piece is taken, affords several other ballads, wherein the word Child occurs as a title: but in none of these it signifies “Prince.” See the song intitled Gil Morrice, in this volume. It ought to be observed that the Word Child or Chield is still used in North Britain to denominate a Man, commonly with some contemptuous character affixed to him: but sometimes to denote Man in general. Childe Waters in his stable stoode And stroakt his milke-white steede: To him a fayre yonge ladye came As ever ware womans weede. Sayes, Christ you save, good Childe Waters; Sayes, Christ you save, and see: My girdle of gold that was too longe, Is now too short for mee. And all is with one childe of yours, I feele sturre at my side: My gowne of greene it is too straighte; Before, it was too wide. If the childe be mine, faire Ellen, he sayd, Be mine as you tell mee; Then take you Cheshire and Lancashire both, Take them your owne to bee. If the childe be mine, faire Ellen, he sayd, Be mine, as you doe sweare; Then take you Cheshire and Lancashire both, And make that childe your heyre. Shee sayes, I had rather have one kisse, Childe Waters, of thy mouth; Than I wolde have Cheshire and Lancashire both, That lye by north and southe. And I had rather have one twinkling, Childe Waters, of thine ee: Then I wolde have Cheshire and Lancashire both, To take them mine owne to bee. To morrowe, Ellen, I must forth ryde Farr into the north countree; The fayrest ladye that I can finde, Ellen, must goe with mee. ‘Thoughe I am not that ladye fayre, ‘Yet let me go with thee’: And ever I pray you, Childe Watèrs, Your foot-page let me bee. If you will my foot-page bee, Ellèn, As you doe tell to mee; Then you must cut your gowne of greene, An inch above your knee: Soe must you doe your yellowe lockes, An inch above your ee: You must tell no man what is my name; My footpage then you shall bee. Shee, all the long daye Childe Waters rode, Ran barefoote by his syde; Yet was he never soe courteous a knighte, To say, Ellen, will you ryde? Shee, all the long daye Childe Waters rode, Ran barefoote thorow the broome; Yet was hee never soe courteous a knighte, To say, put on your shoone. Ride softlye, shee sayd, O Childe Waters, Why doe you ryde so fast? The childe, which is no mans but thine, My bodye itt will brast. Hee sayth, seest thou yond water, Ellen, That flows from banke to brimme.— I trust in God, O Childe Waters, You never will see me swimme. But when shee came to the water syde, Shee sayled to the chinne: Nowe the Lord of heaven be my speede, For I must learne to swimme. The salt waters bare up her clothes; Our Ladye bare up her chinne: Childe Waters was a woe man, good Lord, To fee faire Ellen swimme. And when shee over the water was Shee then came to his knee. Hee sayd, Come hither, thou fayre Ellèn, Loe yonder what I see. Seest thou not yonder hall, Ellèn? Of red gold shines the yate: Of twenty foure faire ladyes there The fairest is my mate. Seest thou not yonder hall, Ellèn? Of red golde shines the towre: There are twenty four fayre ladyes there, The fayrest is my paramoure. I see the hall now, Childe Waters, Of red golde shines the yate: God give you good now of yourselfe, And of your worthye mate. worldlye, MS. I see the hall now, Childe Waters, Of red golde shines the towre: God give you good now of yourselfe, And of your paramoure. There twenty four fayre ladyes were A playing at the ball: And Ellen the fayrest ladye there, Must bring his steed to the stall. There twenty four fayre ladyes were, A playinge at the chesse; And Ellen the fayrest ladye there, Must bring his horse to grasse. And then bespake Childe Waters sister, These were the wordes sayd shee: You have the prettyest page, brothèr, That ever I did see. But that his bellye it is foe bigge, His girdle stands soe hye: And ever I pray you, Childe Watèrs, Let him in my chamber lye. It is not fit for a little foot page, That has run throughe mosse and myre, To lye in the chamber of any ladye, That weares soe riche attyre. It is more meete for a little foot page, That has run throughe mosse and myre, To take his supper upon his knee, And lye by the kitchen fyre. Now when they had supped every one, To bedd they tooke theyr waye: He sayd, come hither, my little foot-page, And hearken what I saye. Goe thee downe into yonder towne, And lowe into the streete; The fayrest ladye that thou canst finde, Hyre in mine armes to sleepe, And take her up in thine armes twaine, For filing i. e. defiling. See Warton's Obser. Vol. 2. p. 158. of her feete. Ellen is gone into the towne, And lowe into the streete: The fayrest ladye that shee colde finde, She hyred in his armes to sleepe; And tooke her up in her armes twayne, For filing of her feete. I praye you nowe, good Childe Watèrs, Let mee lye at your feete: For there is noe place about this house, Where I may saye a sleepe. i. e. essay, attempt. ‘He gave her leave, and faire Ellèn ‘Down at his beds feet laye: This done the nighte drove on apace, And when it was neare the daye, Hee sayd, Rise up, my little foot-page, Give my steede corne and haye; And give him nowe the good black oats, To carry mee better awaye. Up then rose the fayre Ellèn And gave his steede corne and haye: And soe shee did the good black oates, To carry him the better awaye. She leaned her back to the manger side, And grievouslye did groane: Shee leaned her back to the manger side, And there shee made her moane. And that beheard his mother deare, Shee heard ‘her woefull woe.’ Shee sayd, Rise up, thou Childe Watèrs, And into thy stable goe. For in thy stable is a ghost, That grievouslye doth grone: Or else some woman laboures with childe, Shee is so woe-begone. Up then rose Childe Waters soone, And did on his shirte of silke; And then he put on his other clothes, On his bodye as white as milke. And when he came to the stable dore, Full still there hee did stand, That hee mighte heare his fayre Ellèn, Howe shee made her monànd. i. e. moaning, bemoaning, &amp;c. Shee sayd, Lullabye, mine own dear childe, Lullabye, deare childe, deare: I wolde thy father were a kinge, Thy mothere layd on a biere. Peace nowe, hee sayd, good faire Elleèn, Bee of good cheere, I praye; And the bridall and the churchinge bothe Shall bee upon one daye. X. PHILLIDA AND CORYDON. This Sonnet is given from a small quarto MS in the editor's possession, written in the time of Q. Elizabeth. Another Copy of it, containing some variations, is reprinted in the Muses Library p. 295. from an ancient miscellany, intitled England's Helicon 1600. 4to. The author was Nicholas Breton, a writer of some fame in the reign of Elizabeth; who also published an interlude intitled “An old man's lesson and a young man's love.” 1605. 4to. and many other little pieces in prose and verse, the titles of which may be seen in Winstanley, Ames' Typog. and Osborne's Harl. catalog. &amp;c.—He is mentioned with great respect by Meres, in his 2d pt of Wit's Common-wealth. 1598. f. 283. and is alluded to in Beaumont and Fletcher's Scornful Lady, Act 2. and again in Wit without money, A. 3. —See Whalley's Ben Jonson, vol. 3. p. 103. Phillida and Corydon is one of the Songs in “The Honourable Entertainment gieven to the Queenes Majestie in Progresse at Elvetham in Hampshire, by the R. H. the Earle of Hertford. 1591.” 4to. [Printed by Wolfe. No name of author.] See in that pamphlet, “The thirde daies Entertainment. “On Wednesday morning about 9 o' clock, as her Majestie opened a casement of her gallerie window, ther were 3 excellent musitians, who being disguised in auncient country attire, did greet her with a pleasant song of Corydon and Phillida, made in 3 parts of purpose. The song, as well for the worth of the dittie, as the aptnesse of the note thereto applied, it pleased her Highnesse after it had been once sung to commend it againe, and highly to grace it with her cheerefull acceptance and commendation. “The Plowman's Song. In the merrie month of May, &amp;c.” The Splendour and Magnificence of Elizabeth's reign is no where more strongly painted than in these little Diaries of some of her summer excursions to the houses of her nobility; nor could a more acceptable present be given to the world, than a republication of a select number of such details as this of the entertainment at Elvetham, that at Killingworth, Vid. Vol. I. Introd.—Vol. III. p. 25. &amp;c. &amp;c. which so strongly mark the spirit of the times and present us with scenes so very remote from modern manners. In the merrie moneth of Maye, In a morne by break of daye, With a troope of damselles playing Forthe ‘I yode’ forsooth a maying: the wode. MS. When anon by a wood fide, Where that Maye was in his pride, I espied all alone Phillida and Corydon. Muche adoe there was, god wot; He wold love, and she wold not: She sayde, never man was trewe; He sayes, never false to you. He sayde, hee had lovde her longe: She sayes, love should have no wronge. Corydon wold kisse her then: She sayes, maydes must kisse no men, Tyll they doe for good and all: When she made the shepperde call All the heavens to wytnes truthe, Never loved a truer youthe. Then with manie a prettie othe, Yea and nay, and, faith and trothe; Suche as seelie shepperdes use When they would not love abuse; Love, that had bene long deluded, Was with kisses sweete concluded; And the mayde with garlands gaye ‘Crownde’ the lady of the Maye. Was the MS. XI. LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD. This ballad is ancient, and has been popular: we find it quoted in many old plays. See Beaum. and Fletcher's Knight of the Burning Pestle. 4??. 1613. Act 5. The Varietie, a comedy, 12??. 1649. Act 4. &amp;c. In Sir William Davenant's play, The Witts, A. 3, a gallant thus boasts of himself, “Limber and sound! besides I sing Musgrave, “And for Chevy-chace no lark comes near me. In the Pepys Collection is an imitation of this old song, in a different measure, by a more modern pen, with many alterations, but evidently for the worse. This is given from an old printed copy in the British Museum, corrected in part by the Editor's folio manuscript. As it fell out on a highe holye daye, As many bee in the yeare, When yong men and maides together do goe Their masses and mattins to heare, Little Musgràve came to the church door, The priest was at the mass; But he had more mind of the fine womèn, Then he had of our Ladyes grace. And some of them were clad in greene, And others were clad in pall; And then came in my Lord Barnardes wife, The fairest among them all. Shee cast an eye on little Musgràve, As bright as the summer sunne: O then bethought him little Musgràve, This ladyes heart I have wonne. Quoth she, I have loved thee, little Musgràve, Fulle long and manye a daye. So have I loved you, ladye faire, Yet word I never durst saye. I have a bower at Bucklesford-Bury, Full daintilye bedight, If thoult wend thither, my little Musgràve, Thoust lig in mine armes all night. Quoth hee, I thanke yee, ladye faire, This kindness yee shew to mee; And whether it be to my weale or woe, This night will I lig with thee. All this beheard a tiney foot-page, By his ladyes coach as he ranne: Quoth he, thoughe I am my ladyes page, Yet Ime my lord Barnardes manne. My lord Barnàrd shall knowe of this Although I lose a limbe. And ever whereas the bridges were broke, He layd hin downe to swimme. Asleep or awake, thou lord Barnàard, As thou art a man of life, Lo! this same night at Bucklesford-Bury Little Musgraves abed with thy wife. If it be trewe, thou tiney foot-page, This tale thou hast told to mee, Then all my lands in Bucklesford-Bury I freelye will give to thee. But and it be a lye, thou tiney foot-page, This tale thou hast told to mee, On the highest tree in Bucklesford-Bury All hanged shalt thou bee. Rise up, rise up, my merry men all, And saddle to me my steede; This night must I to Bucklesford-Bury; God wott, I had never more neede. Then some they whistled, and some they sang, And some did loudlye saye, Whenever lord Barnardes horne it blewe Awaye, Musgràve, away. Methinkes I hear the throftle cocke, Methinkes I heare the jaye, Methinkes I heare lord Barnardes horne; I would I were awaye. Lye still, lye still, thou little Musgrà, And huggle me from the cold; For it is but some shephardes boye A whistling his sheepe to the fold. Is not thy hawke upon the pearche, Thy horse eating corne and haye? And thou a gaye ladye within thine armes: And wouldst thou be awaye? With that lord Barnard came to the dore, And lighted upon a stone; And he pulled out three silver keyes, And opened the dores eche one. He lifted up the coverlett, He lifted up the sheete; How now, how now, thou little Musgràve, Dost find my gaye ladye sweete? I find her sweete, quoth little Musgràve, The more is my griefe and paine; Ide gladlye give three hundred poundes That I were on yonder plaine. Arise, arise, thou little Musgràve, And put thy cloathes nowe on, It shall never be said in my countree, That I killed a naked man. I have two swordes in one scabbàrde, Full deare they cost my purse; And thou shalt have the best of them, And I will have the worse. The first stroke that little Musgrave strucke, He hurt lord Barnard sore; The next stroke that lord Barnard strucke, Little Musgrave never strucke more. With that bespake the ladye faire, In bed whereas she laye, Althoughe thou art dead, my little Musgràve, Yet for thee I will praye: And wishe well to thy soule will I, So long as I have life; So will I not do for thee, Barnàrd, Thoughe I am thy wedded wife. He cut her pappes from off her brest; Great pitye it was to see Some drops of this fair ladyes bloode Run trickling downe her knee. Wo worth, wo worth ye, my merrye men all, You never were borne for my goode: Why did you not offer to stay my hande, When you see me wax so woode? For I have slaine the fairest sir knighte, That ever rode on a steede; So have I done the fairest ladyè, That evér ware womans weede. A grave, a grave, lord Barnard cryde, To putt these lovers in; But lay my ladye o' the upper hande, For shee comes o' the better kin. XII. THE EW-BUGHTS MARION. A Scottish Song. This sonnet is said to be of great antiquity: that and it's simplicity of sentiment have recommended it to a place here. Will ze gae to the ew-bughts, Marion, And wear in the sheip wi' mee? The sun shines sweit, my Marion, But nae half sae sweit as thee. O Marion's a bonnie lass; And the blyth blinks in her ee: And fain wad I marrie Marion, Gin Marion wad marrie mee. Theires gowd in zour garters, Marion; And siller on zour white hauss-bane: Fou faine wad I kisse my Marion At eene quhan I cum hame. Theires braw lads in Earnslaw, Marion, Quha gape and glowr wi' their ee At kirk, quhan they see my Marion; Bot nane of tham lues like mee. Ive nine milk-ews, my Marion, A cow and a brawney quay: Ile gie tham au to my Marion, Just on her bridal day. And zees get a grein sey apron, And waistcote o' London broun; And wow bot ze will be vaporing Quhaneer ze gang to the toun. Ime yong and stout, my Marion, Nane dance lik mee on the greine; And gin ze forsak me, Marion, Ile een gae draw up wi' Jeane. Sae put on zour pearlins, Marion, And kirtle oth cramasie; And sune as my chin has nae haire on, I sall cum west, and see zee. XIII. THE KNIGHT, AND SHEPHERD'S DAUGHTER. This ballad (given from an old black-letter Copy) was popular in the time of Q. Elizabeth, being usually printed with her picture before it, as Hearne informs us in his preface to “Gul. Neubrig. Hist. Oxon. 1719. 8vo. vol. 1. p. lxx.” It is quoted in Fletcher's comedy of the Pilgrim, Act. 4. sc. 1. There was a shepherds daughter Came tripping on the waye; And there by chance a knighte shee mett, Which caused her to staye. Good morrowe to you, beauteous maide, These words pronounced hee: O I shall dye this daye, he sayd, If Ive not my wille of thee. The Lord forbid, the maide replyde, That you shold waxe so wode! ‘But for all that shee could do or saye, ‘He wold not be withstood. Sith you have had your will of mee, And put me to open shame, Now, if you are a courteous knighte, Tell me what is your name? Some do call mee Jacke, sweet heart, And some do call mee Jille; But when I come to the kings faire courte They call me Wilfulle Wille. He sett his foot into the stirrup, And awaye then he did ride; She tuckt her girdle about her middle And ranne close by his side. But when she came to the brode watèr, She sett her brest and swamme; And when she was got out againe, She tooke to her heels and ranne. He never was the courteous knighte, To saye, faire maide, will ye ride? Nor she was never so loving a maide To saye, sir knighte abide. When she came to the kings faire courte, She knocked at the ring; So readye was the king himself To let this faire maide in. Now Christ you save, my gracious liege, Now Christ you save and see, You have a knighte within your courte This daye hath robbed mee. What hath he robbed thee of, sweet heart? Of purple or of pall? Or hath he took thy gaye gold ring From off thy finger small? He hath not robbed mee, my leige, Of purple nor of pall: But he hath gotten my maiden head, Which grieves mee worst of all. Now if he be a batchelor, His bodye Ile give to thee; This was agreeable to the feudal customs: The Lord had a right to give a wife to his vassals. See Shakespeare's, “All's well, that ends well.” But if he be a married man, High hanged hee shall bee. He called downe his merrye men all, By one, by two, by three; Sir William used to bee the first, But nowe the last came hee. He brought her downe full fortye pounde, Tyed up withinne a glove: Faire maid, Ile give the same to thee; Go, seeke thee another love. O Ile have none of your gold, she sayde, Nor Ile have none of your fee; But your faire bodye I must have The king hath granted mee. Sir William ranne and fetchd her then Five hundred pound in golde, Saying, faire maide, take this to thee, Thy fault will never be tolde. Tis not the gold that shall mee tempt, These words then answered shee, But your own bodye I must have, The king hath granted mee. Would I had dranke the water cleare, When I did drinke the wine, Rather than any shepherds brat Shold bee a ladye of mine! Would I had drank the puddle foule, When I did drink the ale, Rather than ever a shepherds brat Shold tell me such a tale! A shepherds brat even as I was, You mote have let me bee, I never had come to the kings faire courte, To crave any love of thee. He sett her on a milk-white steede, And himself upon a graye; He hung a bugle about his necke, And soe they rode awaye. But when they came unto the place, Where marriage-rites were done, She proved herself a dukes daughtèr, And he but a squires sonne. Now marrye me, or not, sir knight, Your pleasure shall be free: If you make me ladye of one good towne, Ile make you lord of three. Ah! cursed bee the gold, he sayd, If thou hadst not been trewe, I shold have forsaken my sweet love, And have changd her for a newe. And now their hearts being linked fast, They joyned hand in hande: Thus he had both purse, and person too, And all at his commande. XIV. THE SHEPHERD'S ADDRESS TO HIS MUSE. From the small MS volume, mentioned above in page 62. Good Muse, rocke me aslepe With some sweete harmony: This wearie eyes is not to kepe Thy wary company. Sweete Love, begon a while, Thou seest my heavines: Beautie is borne but to beguyle My harte of happines. See howe my little flocke, That lovde to feede on highe, Doe headlonge tumble downe the rocke, And in the valley dye. The bushes and the trees, That were so freshe and greene, Doe all their deintie colors leese, And not a leafe is seene. The blacke birde and the thrushe, That made the woodes to ringe, With all the rest, are now at hushe, And not a note do singe. Swete Philomene, the birde That hath the heavenly throte, Doth nowe, alas! not once afforde Recordinge of a note. The flowers have had a frost, The herbs have loste their savoure; ‘For haples Corydon’ hath lost ‘His lovelye Phyllis’ favoure. And therefore, my sweete Muse, That knowest what helpe is best, Doe nowe thy heavenlie conninge use To sett my harte at rest: And in a dreame bewraie What fate shall be my frende; Whether my life shall stil decaye, Or soone my sorrowes ende. XV. LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ELLINOR. From an ancient copy in black letter, in the Pepys collection, intitled, “A tragical ballad on the unfortunate love of lord Thomas and fair Ellinor, together with the downfall of the browne girl.”—In the same collection may be seen an attempt to modernize this old song, and reduce it to a different measure. A proof of it's popularity. Lord Thomas he was a bold forrestèr, And a chaser of the kings deere; Faire Ellinor was a fine womàn, And lord Thomas he loved her deare. Come riddle my riddle, dear mother, he sayd, And riddle us both as one; Whether I shall marrye with faire Ellinòr, And let the browne girl alone? The browne girl she has got houses and lands, Faire Ellinor she has got none, And therefore I charge thee on my blessìng, To bring me the browne girl home. And as it befelle on a high holidaye, As many there are beside, Lord Thomas he went to faire Ellinòr, That should have been his bride. And when he came to faire Ellinors bower, He knocked there at the ring, And who was so readye as faire Ellinòr, To lett lord Thomas withinn. What newes, what newes, lord Thomas, she sayd? What newes dost thou bring to mee? I am come to bid thee to my weddìng, And that is bad newes for thee. O God forbid, lord Thomas, she sayd, That such a thing should be done; I thought to have been thy bride my selfe, And thou to have been the bridegrome. Come riddle my riddle, dear mother, she sayd, And riddle it all in one; Whether I shall goe to lord Thomas his wedding, Or whether shall tarry at home? There are manye that are your friendes, daughtèr, And manye that are your foe, Therefore I charge you on my blessing, To lord Thomas his wedding don't goe. There are manye that are my friendes, mothèr; But if thousands there were my foe, Betide me life, betide me death, To lord Thomas his wedding Ile goe. She cloathed herself in gallant attire, And her merrye men all in greene, And as they rid through everye towne, They took her to be some queene. But when she came to lord Thomas his gate, She knocked there at the ring; And who was so readye as lord Thomàs, To lett faire Ellinor in. Is this your bride, faire Ellinor sayd? Methinks she looks wonderous browne; Thou mightest have had as faire a womàn, As ever trod on the grounde. Despise her not, fair Ellin, he sayd, Despise her not unto mee; For better I love thy little fingèr, Than all her whole bodèe. This browne bride had a little penknife, That was both long and sharpe, And betwixt the short ribs and the long, She prickd faire Ellinor's harte. O Christ thee save, lord Thomas hee sayd, Methinks thou lookst wonderous wan; Thou usedst to look with as fresh a colòur, As ever the sun shone on. Oh, art thou blind, lord Thomas? she sayd, Or canst thou not very well see? Oh! dost thou not see my owne hearts bloode Run trickling down my knee. Lord Thomas he had a sword by his side; As he walked about the halle, He cut off his brides head from her shouldèrs, And threw it against the walle. He set the hilte against the grounde, And the point against his harte. There never three lovers together did meete, That sooner againe did parte. The reader will find a Scottish song on a similar subject to this, towards the end of this volume, intitled “Lord Thomas and Lady Annet.” XVI. CUPID AND CAMPASPE. This elegant little sonnet is found in the third act of an old play intitled, “Alexander and Campaspe,” written by John Lilye, a celebrated writer in the time of queen Elizabeth. This play was first printed in 1591: but the song is given from a later edition. Cupid and my Campaspe playd At cardes for kisses; Cupid payd: He stakes his quiver, bow and arrows, His mothers doves, and teame of sparrows; Loses them too; then down he throws The coral of his lippe, the rose Growing on's cheek, (but none knows how) With these, the crystal of his browe, And then the dimple of his chinne; All these did my Campaspe winne. At last he set her both his eyes, She won, and Cupid blind did rise. O Love! has she done this to thee? What shall, alas! become of mee? XVII. THE LADY TURNED SERVING-MAN —is given from a written copy, containing some improvements, (perhaps modern ones) upon the old popular ballad, intitled, “The famous flower of Serving-men: or the “Lady turned Serving-man.” You beauteous ladyes, great and small, I write unto you one and all, Whereby that you may understand What I have suffered in the land. I was by birth a lady faire, An ancient barons only heire, And when my good old father dyed, Then I became a young knightes bride. And there my love built me a bower, Bedeck'd with many a fragrant flower; A braver bower you ne'er did see Then my true-love did build for mee. And there I livde a ladye gay, Till fortune wrought our loves decay; For there came foes so fierce a band, That soon they over-run the land. They came upon us in the night, And brent my bower, and slew my knight; And trembling hid in mans array, I scant with life escap'd away. In the midst of this extremitìe, My servants all did from me flee: Thus was I left myself alone, With heart more cold than any stone. Yet though my heart was full of care, Heaven would not suffer me to dispaire, Wherefore in haste I chang'd my name From faire Elise, to sweet Williame: And therewithall I cut my haire, Resolv'd my man's attire to weare; And in my beaver, hose and band, I travell'd far through many a land. At length all wearied with my toil, I sate me downe to rest awhile; My heart it was so fill'd with woe, That downe my cheeke the teares did flow. It chanc'd the king of that same place With all his lords a hunting was, And seeing me weepe, upon the same Askt who I was, and whence I came. Then to his grace I did replye, I am a poore and friendlesse boye, Though nobly borne, nowe forc'd to bee A serving-man of lowe degree. Stand up, faire youth, the king reply'd, For thee a service I'll provyde; But tell me first what thou canst do, Thou shalt be fitted thereunto. Wilt thou be usher of my hall, To wait upon my nobles all? Or wilt be taster of my wine, To 'tend on me when I shall dine? Or wilt thou be my chamberlaine, About my person to remaine? Or wilt thou be one of my guard, And I will give thee great reward? Chuse, gentle, youth, said he, thy place. Then I reply'd, if it please your grace, To shew such favour unto mee, Your chamberlaine I faine would bee. The king then smiling gave consent, And straitwaye to his court I went; Where I behavde so faithfullìe, That hee great favour showd to mee. Now marke what fortune did provide; The king he would a hunting ride With all his lords and noble traine, Sweet William must at home remaine. Thus being left alone behind, My former state came in my mind, I wept to see my mans array, No longer now a ladye gay. And meeting with a ladyes vest, Within the same myself I drest With silken robes, and jewels rare, I deckt me as a ladye faire. And taking up a lute straitwaye, Upon the same I strove to play, And sweetly to the fame did sing, As made both hall and chamber ring. “My father was as brave a lord, “As ever Europe did afford; “My mother was a lady bright; “My husband was a valiant knight: “And I myself a ladye gay, “Bedeckt with gorgeous rich array; “The happiest lady in the land, “Had not more pleasure at command. “I had my musicke every day “Harmonious lessons for to play; “I had my virgins fair and free, “Continually to wait on mee. “But now, alas! my husband's dead, “And all my friends are from me fled, “My former days are past and gone, “And I am now a serving-man.” And fetching many a tender sigh, As thinking no one then was nigh, In pensive mood I laid me lowe, My heart was full, the tears did flowe. The king, who had a huntinge gone, Grewe weary of his sport anone, And leaving all his gallant traine, Turn'd on the sudden home againe: And when he reach'd his statelye tower, Hearing one sing within his bower, He stopt to listen, and to see Who sung there so melodiouslìe. Thus heard he everye word I sed, And sawe the pearlye teares I shed, And found to his amazement there, Sweete William was a ladye faire. Then stepping in, Faire ladye, rise, And dry, said he, those lovelye eyes, For I have heard thy mournful tale, The which shall turne to thy availe. A crimson dye my face orespred, I blusht for shame, and hung my head, To find my sex and story knowne, When as I thought I was alone. But to be briefe, his royall grace Grewe soe enamour'd of my face, The richest gifts he proffered mee, His mistress if that I would bee. Ah! no, my liege, I firmlye sayd, I'll rather in my grave be layd, And though your grace hath won my heart, I ne'er will act soe base a part. Faire ladye, pardon me, sayde hee, Thy virtue shall rewarded bee, And since it is soe fairly tryde Thou shalt become my royal bride. Then strait to end his amorous strife, He tooke sweet William to his wife: The like before was never seene, A serving-man became a queene. XVIII. GIL MORRICE. A Scottish Ballad. The following piece has lately run thro' two editions in Scotland: the second was printed at Glasgow in 1755. 8 vo. Prefixed to them both is an advertisement, setting forth that the preservation of this poem was owing “to a lady, who favoured the printers with a copy, as it was carefully collected from the mouths of old women and nurses;” And any reader that can render it more correct or complete,” is desired to oblige the public with such improvements. In consequence of this advertisement sixteen additional verses have been produced and handed about in manuscript, which are here inserted in their proper places: (these are from ver. 109. to ver. 121. and from ver. 124. to ver. 129. and are perhaps after all only an ingenious interpolation.) As this poem lays claim to a pretty high antiquity, we have assigned it a place among our early pieces: though, after all, there is reason to believe it has received very considerable modern improvements: for in the Editor's ancient MS collection is a very old imperfect copy of the same ballad: wherein though the leading features of the story are the same, yet the colouring here is so much improved and heightened, and so many additional strokes are thrown in, that it is evident the whole has undergone a revisal. N. B. The Editor's MS instead of “lord Barnard”, has “John Stewart”; and instead of “Gil Morrice”, Child Maurice, which last is probably the original title. See above p. 54. Gil Morrice was an erlès son, His name it waxed wide; It was nae for his great richès, Nor zet his mickle pride; Bot it was for a lady gay, That livd on Carron side. Quhair sall I get a bonny boy, That will win hose and shoen; That will gae to lord Barnards ha', And bid his lady cum? And ze maun rin my errand Willie; something seems wanting here. And ze may rin wi' pride; Quhen other boys gae on their foot, On horse-back ze sall ride. O no! Oh no! my master dear! I dare nae for my life; I'll no gae to the bauld baròns, For to triest furth his wife. My bird Willie, my boy Willie; My dear Willie, he sayd: How can ze strive against the stream? For I shall be obeyd. Bot, O my master dear! he cryd, In grene wod ze're zour lain; Gi owre sic thochts, I walde ze rede, For fear ze should be tain. Haste, haste, I say, gae to the ha', Bid hir cum here wi' speid: If ze refuse my heigh command, Ill gar zour body bleid. Gae bid hir take this gay mantèl, 'Tis a' gowd bot the hem; Bid hir cum to the gude grene wode, And bring nane bot hir lain: And there it is, a silken sarke, Hir ain hand sewd the sleive; And bid hir cum to Gill Morice, Speir nae bauld barons leave. Yes, I will gae zour black errand, Though it be to zour cost; Sen ze by me will nae be warn'd, In it ze sall find frost. The baron he is a man of might, He neir could bide to taunt, As ze will see before its nicht, How sma' ze hae to vaunt. And sen I maun zour errand rin Sae sair against my will, I'se mak a vow and keip it trow, It sall be done for ill. And quhen he came to broken brigue, He bent his bow and swam; And quhen came to grass growìng, Set down his feet and ran. And quhen he came to Barnards ha', Would neither chap nor ca': Bot set his bent bow to his breist, And lichtly lap the wa'. He wauld nae tell the man his errand, Though he stude at the gait; Bot straiht into the ha' he cam, Quhair they were set at meit. Hail! hail! my gentle sire and dame! My message winna waite; Dame, ze maun to the gude grene wod Before that it be late. Ze're bidden tak this gay mantèl, Tis a' gowd bot the hem: Zou maun gae to the gude grene wode, Ev'n by your sel alane. And there it is, a silken sarke, Your ain hand sewd the sleive; Ze maun gae speik to Gill Morìce; Speir nae bauld barons leave. The lady stamped wi' hir foot, And winked wi' hir ee; Bot a' that she coud say or do, Forbidden he wad nae bee. Its surely to my bow'r-womàn; It neir could be to me. I brocht it to lord Barnards lady; I trow that ze be she. Then up and spack the wylie nurse, (The bairn upon hir knee) If it be cum frae Gill Morìce, It's deir welcum to mee. Ze leid, ze leid, ze filthy nurse, Sae loud's I heire ze lee; Perhaps, loud say I heire. I brocht it to lord Barnards lady; I trow ze be nae shee. Then up and spack the bauld baròn, An angry man was hee; He's tain the table wi' his foot, Sae has he wi' his knee; Till siller cup and ezar dish In flinders he gard flee. Gae bring a robe of zour clidìng, That hings upon the pin; And I'll gae to the gude grene wode, And speik wi' zour lemmàn. O bide at hame, now lord Barnàrd, I warde ze bide at hame; Neir wyte a man for violence, That neir wate ze wi' nane. Gil Morice sate in gude grene wode, He whistled and he sang: O what mean a' the folk comìng, My mother tarries lang. His hair was like the threeds of gold, Drawne frae Minervas loome: His lipps like roses drapping dew, His breath was a' perfume. His brow was like the mountain snae Gilt by the morning beam: His cheeks like living roses glow: His een like azure stream. The boy was clad in robes of grene, Sweete as the infant spring: And like the mavis on the bush, He gart the vallies ring. The baron came to the grene wode, Wi' mickle dule and care, And there he first spied Gill Morìce Kameing his zellow hair: That sweetly wavd around his face, That face beyond compare: He sang sae sweet it might dispel, A' rage but fell dispair. So Milton, Vernal delight and joy: able to drive All sadness but despair. B. iv. v. 155. Nae wonder, nae wonder, Gill Morìce, My lady loed thee weel, The fairest part of my body Is blacker than thy heel. Zet neir the less now, Gill Morìce, For a' thy great bewty, Ze's rew the day ze eir was born; That head sall gae wi' me. Now he has drawn his trusty brand, And slaited on the strae; And thro' Gill Morice' fair body He's gar cauld iron gae. And he has tain Gill Morice' head And set it on a speir: The meanest man in a' his train Has gotten that head to bear. And he has tain Gill Morice up, Laid him across his steid, And brocht him to his painted bowr And laid him on a bed. The lady sat on castil wa', Beheld baith dale and doun; And there she saw Gill Morice' head Cum trailing to the toun. Far better I loe that bluidy head, Bot and that zellow hair, Than lord Barnard, and a' his lands, As they lig here and thair. And she has tain her Gill Morice, And kissd baith mouth and chin: I was once as fow of Gill Morice, As the hip is o' the stean. I got ze in my father's house, Wi' mickle sin and shame; I brocht thee up in gude grene wode, Under the heavy rain: Oft have I by thy cradle sitten, And fondly seen thee sleip; Bot now I gae about thy grave, The saut tears for to weip. And syne she kissd his bluidy cheik, And syne his bluidy chin: O better I loe my Gill Morice Than a' my kith and kin! Away, away, ze ill womàn, And an il deith mait ze dee: Gin I had kend he'd bin zour son, He'd neir bin slain for mee. Obraid me not, my lord Barnard! Obraid me not for shame! Wi that saim speir O pierce my heart! And put me out o' pain. Since nothing bot Gill Morice head Thy jelous rage could quell, Let that saim hand now tak hir life, That neir to thee did ill. To me nae after days nor nichts Will eir be saft or kind; I'll fill the air with heavy sighs, And greet till I am blind. Enouch of blood by me's bin spilt, Seek not zour death frae mee; I rather lourd it had been my sel Than eather him or thee. With waefo wae I hear zour plaint; Sair, sair I rew the deid, That eir this cursed hand of mine Had gard his body bleid. Dry up zour tears, my winsom dame, Ze neir can heal the wound; Ze see his head upon the speir, His heart's blude on the ground. I curse the hand that did the deid, The heart that thocht the ill; The feet that bore me wi' sik speid, The comely zouth to kill. I'll ay lament for Gill Morice, As gin he were my ain; I'll neir forget the dreiry day On which the zouth was slain. The foregoing ballad is said to have furnished the plot to the tragedy of Douglas. It may be proper to mention that other copies read ver. 110. thus “Shot frae the golden sun.” And ver. 116. as follows “His een like azure sheene.” THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. I. THE LEGEND OF SIR GUY —contains a short summary of the exploits of this famous champion, as recorded in the old story books; and is commonly intitled, “A pleasant song of the valiant deeds of chivalry atchieved by that noble knight sir Guy of Warwick, who, for the love of fair Phelis, became a hermit, and dyed in a cave of craggy rocke, a mile distant from Warwick.” The history of sir Guy, tho' now very properly resigned to children, was once admired by all readers of wit and taste: for taste and wit had once their childhood. Tho' of English growth, it was early a favourite with other nations: it appeared in French in 1525: and is alluded to the old Spanish romance Tirante el blanco, which it is believed was written not long after the year 1430. See advertisement to the French translation, 2 vols. 12 mo. The original whence all these stories are extracted is a very ancient romance in old English verse, which is quoted by Chaucer as a celebrated piece even in his time, (viz.) “Men speken of romances of price, “Of Horne childe and Ippotis, “Of Bevis, and sir Guy, &amp;c. R. of Thop. and was usually sung to the harp at Christmas dinners and brideales, as we learn from Puttenham's art of poetry, 4 to. 1589. This ancient romance is not wholly lost. An imperfect copy in black letter, “Imprynted at London—for Wylliam Copland.” in 34 sheets 4 to. without date, is still preserved among Mr. Garrick's collection of old plays. As a specimen of the poetry of this antique rhymer, take his description of the dragon mentioned in ver. 105 of the following ballad, —“A messenger came to the king. “Syr king, he sayd, lysten me now, “For bad tydinges I bring you, “In Northumberlande there is no man, “But that they be slayne everychone: “For there dare no man route, “By twenty myle rounde aboute, “For doubt of a fowle dragon, “That sleath men and beastes downe. “He is blacke as any cole, “Rugged as a rough fole; “His bodye from the navill upwarde “No man may it pierce it is so harde; “His neck is great as any summere; “He renneth as swifte as any distrere; “Pawes he hath as a lyon: “All that he toucheth he sleath dead downe. “Great winges he hath to flight, “That is no man that bare him might. “There may no man fight him agayne, “But that he sleath him certayne: “For a fowler beast then is he, “Ywis of none never heard ye.” The accurate Dugdale is of opinion that the story of Guy is not wholly apocryphal, tho' he acknowledges the monks have sounded out his praises too hyperbolically. In particular, he gives the duel fought with the Danish champion as a real historical truth, and fixes the date of it in the year 929, Ætat. Guy, 70. See his Warwickshire. The following is written upon the same plan, as ballad V. Book I. but which is the original and which the copy, cannot be decided. This song is ancient, as may be inferred from the idiom preserved in the margin, ver. 94. 102: and was once popular, as appears from Fletcher's Knight of the burning pestle, act. 2. sc. ult. Printed from an ancient MS copy in the Editor's old folio volume, collated with two printed ones, one of which is in black letter in the Pepys collection. Was ever knight for ladyes sake Soe tost in love, as I sir Guy For Phelis fayre, that lady bright As ever man beheld with eye? Shee gave me leave myself to try, The valiant knight with sheeld and speare, Ere that her love shee wold grant me; Which made mee venture far and neare. Then proved I a baron bold, The proud sir Guy. P. In deeds of armes the doughtyest knight That in those dayes in England was, With sworde and speare in feild to fight. An English man I was by birthe: In faith of Christ a christyan true: The wicked lawes of infidells I sought by prowesse to subdue. ‘Nine’ hundred twenty yeere and odde Two hundred. MS and P. After our Saviour Christ his birthe, When king Athèlstone wore the crowne, I lived heere upon the earthe. Sometime I was of Warwicke erle, And, as I sayd, of very truthe A ladyes love did me constraine To seeke strange ventures in my youthe. To win me fame by feates of armes In strange and sundry heathen lands; Where I atchieved for her sake Right dangerous conquests with my hands. For first I sayled to Normandye, And there I stoutlye wan in fight The emperours daughter of Almayne, From manye a vallyant worthye knight. Then passed I the seas to Greece To helpe the emperour in his right; Against the mightye souldans hoaste Of puissant Persians for to fight. Where I did slay of Sarazens, And heathen pagans, manye a man; And slew the souldans cozen deare, Who had to name doughtye Coldràn. Eskeldered a famous knight To death likewise I did pursue: And Elmayne king of Tyre alsoe, Most terrible in fight to viewe. I went into the souldans hoast, Being thither on embassage sent, And brought his head awaye with mee, I having slaine him in his tent. There was a dragon in that land Most fiercelye mett me by the way As hee a lyon did pursue, Which I myself did alsoe slay. Then soon I past the seas from Greece, And came to Pavye land aright: Where I the duke of Pavye killd, His hainous treason to requite. To England then I came with speede, To wedd faire Phelis ladye bright: For love of whome I travelled farr To try my manhood and my might. But when I had espoused her, I stayd with her but fortye dayes, Ere that I left this ladye faire, And went from her beyond the seas. All cladd in gray, in pilgrime sort, My voyage from her I did take Unto the blessed Holy-land, For Jesus Christ my Saviours sake. Where I erle Jonas did redeeme, And all his sonnes which were fifteene, Who with the cruell Sarazens In prison for long time had beene. I slew the gyant Amarant In battel fiercelye hand to hand: And doughty Barknard killed I, A treacherous knight of Pavye land. Then I to England came againe, And here with Colbronde fell I fought: An ugly gyant, which the Danes Had for their champion hither brought. I overcame him in the feild, And slewe him soone right valliantlye; Wherebye this land I did redeeme From Danish tribute utterlye. And afterwards I offered upp The use of weapons solemnlye At Winchester, whereas I fought, In sight of manye farr and nye. ‘But first,’ neare Winsor, I did slaye A bore of passing might and strength; Whose like in England never was For hugenesse both in bredth, and length. Some of his bones in Warwicke yet, Within the castle there doe lye: doth lye. MS. One of his sheild-bones to this day Hangs in the citye of Coventrye. On Dunsmore heath I alsoe slewe A monstrous wyld and cruell beast, Calld the Dun-cow of Dunsmore heath; Which manye people had opprest. Some of her bones in Warwicke yett Still for a monument doe lye; doth lye. MS. Which unto every lookers viewe As wonderous strange, they may espye. A dragon in Northumberland, I alsoe did in fight destroye, Which did bothe man and beast oppresse, And all the countrye sore annoye. At length to Warwicke I did come, Like pilgrime poore and was not knowne; And there I livd a hermites life A mile and more out of the towne. Where with my hands I hewed a house Out of a craggy rocke of stone; And lived like a palmer poore Within that cave myself alone: And dailye came to begg my bread Of Phelis at my castle gate; Not knowne unto my loving wife, Who dailye mourned for her mate. Till at the last I fell sore sicke, Yea sicke soe sore that I must die; I sent to her a ringe of golde, By which she knewe me presentlye. Then shee repairing to the cave Before that I gave up the ghost; Herself closd up my dying eyes: My Phelis faire, whom I lovd most. Thus dreadful death did me arrest, To bring my corpes unto the grave; And like a palmer dyed I, Wherby I sought my soule to save. My body that endured this toyle, Though now it be consumed to mold; My statue faire engraven in stone, In Warwicke still you may behold. II. GUY AND AMARANT. The Editor found this Poem in his ancient folio manuscript among the old ballads; he was desirous therefore that it should still accompany them; and as it is not altogether devoid of merit, its insertion here will be pardoned. Although this piece seems not imperfect, there is reason to believe that it is only a part of a much larger poem, which contained the whole history of sir Guy: for upon comparing it with the common story book 12mo, we find the latter to be nothing more than this poem reduced to prose: which is only effected by now and then altering the rhyme, and throwing out some few of the poetical ornaments. The disguise is so slight that it is an easy matter to pick complete stanzas in any page of that book. The author of this poem has shown some invention. Though he took the subject from the old romance quoted before, he has adorned it afresh, and made the story intirely his own. Guy journeyed ore the sanctifyed ground, Whereas the Jewes fayre citye sometime stood, Wherin our Saviours sacred head was crownd, And where for sinfull man he shed his blood: To see the sepulcher was his intent, The tombe that Joseph unto Jesus lent. With tedious miles he tyred his wearye feet, And passed desart places full of danger, At last with a most woefull wight Erle Jonas, mentioned in the foregoing ballad. did meet, A man that unto sorrow was noe stranger: For he had fifteen sonnes, made captives all To slavish bondage, in extremest thrall. A gyant called Amarant detaind them, Whom noe man durst encounter for his strength: Who in a castle, which he held, had chaind them: Guy questions, where? and understands at length The place not farr.—Lend me thy sword, quoth hee, Ile lend my manhood all thy sonnes to free. With that he goes, and lays upon the dore, Like one, he sayes, that must, and will come in: The gyant he was nere soe rowzd before; For noe such knocking at his gate had bin: Soe takes his keyes, and clubb, and goeth out Staring with ireful countenance about. Sirra, sayes hee, what busines hast thou heere? Art come to feast the crowes about my walls? Didst never heare, noe ransome cold him cleere, That in the compas of my furye falls: For making me to take a porters paines, With this same clubb I will dash out thy braines. Gyant, sayes Guy, y'are quarrelsome I see, Choller and you are something neere of kin: Most dangerous at a clubb belike you bee, I have bin better armd, though nowe goe thin; But shew thy utmost hate, enlarge thy spight, Keene is my weapon, and must doe me right. Soe takes his sword, salutes him with the same About the head, the shoulders, and the sides: Whilst his erected clubb doth death proclaime, Standinge with huge Colossus' spacious strides, Putting such vigour to his knotted beame, That like a furnace he did smoke extreame. But on the ground he spent his strokes in vaine, For Guy was nimble to avoyde them still, And ere he cold recover his clubb againe, Did beate his plated coat against his will: Att such advantage Guy wold never fayle, To beat him soundlye in his coate of mayle. Att last through ‘lacke of’ strength hee feeble grewe, And sayd to Guy, as thou'rt of humane race, Shew itt in this, give natures wants their dewe, Let me but goe, and drinke in yonder place: Thou canst not yeeld to ‘me’ a smaller thing, Than to grant life, thats given by the spring. I give thee leave, sayes Guye, goe drinke thy last, Go pledge the dragon, and the savage bore Which Guy had slain before.: Succeed the tragedyes that they have past, But never thinke to drinke cold water more: Drinke deepe to Death and unto him carouse: Bid him receive thee in his earthen house. Soe to the spring he goes, and slakes his thirst; Takeing the water in extremely like Some wracked shipp that on some rocke is burst, Whose forced hulke against the stones does stryke; bulke. MS. Scoping it in soe fast with both his hands, That Guy admiring to behold him stands. Come on, quoth Guy, lets to our worke againe, Thou stayest about thy liquor overlong; The fish, which in the river doe remaine, Will want thereby; thy drinking doth them wrong: But I will ‘have’ their satisfaction made, With gyants blood they must, and shall be payd. Villaine, quoth Amarant, Ile crush thee streight; Thy life shall pay thy daring toungs offence: This clubb, which is about some hundred weight, Has deathes commission to dispatch thee hence: Dresse thee for ravens dyett I must needes; And breake thy bones, as they were made of reedes. Incensed much att this bold pagans bostes, Which worthye Guy cold ill endure to heare, He hewes upon those bigg supporting postes, Which like two pillars did his body beare: Amarant for those wounds in choller growes, And desperatelye att Guy his clubb he throwes: Which did directly on his body light, Soe heavy, and so weighty there-withall, That downe to ground on sudden came the knight; And, ere he cold recover from his fall, The gyant gott his clubb againe in fist, And aimd a blowe that wonderfullye mist. Traytor, quoth Guy, thy falshood Ile repay, This coward act to intercept my bloode. Sayes Amarant, Ile murther any way, With enemyes all vantages are good: O cold I poyson in thy nostrills blowe, Besure of it I wold destroy thee soe. Its well, said Guy, thy honest thoughts appeare, Within that beastlye bulke where devills dwell, Which are thy tenants while thou livest heare, But will be landlords when thou comest in hell: Vile miscreant, prepare thee for their den, Inhumane monster, hurtfull unto men. But breathe thy selfe a time, while I goe drinke, For flameing Phœbus with his fyerye eye Torments me soe with burning heat, I thinke My thirst wold serve to drinke an ocean drye: Forbear a litle, as I delt with thee. Quoth Amarant, thou hast noe foole of mee. Noe, sillye wretch, my father taught more witt, How I shold use such enemyes as thou, By all my gods I doe rejoice at itt, To understand that thirst constraines thee now; For all the treasure, that the world containes, One drop of water shall not coole thy vaines. Releeve my foe! why, 'twere a madmans part: Refresh an adversarye to my wrong: If thou imagine this, a child thou art: Noe, fellow, I have known the world too long To be soe simple: now I know thy want, A minutes space to thee I will not grant. And with these words heaving aloft his clubb Into the ayre, he swings the same about: Then shakes his lockes, and doth his temples rubb, And, like the Cyclops, in his pride doth shout, Sirra, sayes hee, I have you at a lift, Now you are come unto your latest shift. Perish forever: with this stroke I send thee A medicine, will doe thy thirst much good; Take noe more care of drinke before I end thee, And then weele have carouses of thy blood: Here's at thee with a butchers downright blow, To please my furye with thine overthrow. Infernall, false, obdurate feend, said Guy, That seemst a lumpe of crueltye from hell; Ungratefull monster, since thou dost deny The thing to mee wherin I used thee well: With more revenge, than ere my sword did make, On thy accursed head revenge Ile take. Thy gyants longitude shall shorter shrinke, Except thy sun-scorcht skin be weapon proof: Farewell my thirst; I doe disdaine to drinke, Streames keepe your waters to your owne behoof; Or let wild beasts be welcome thereunto; With those pearle drops I will not have to do. Here, tyrant, take a taste of my good-will, For thus I doe begin my bloodye bout: You cannot chuse but like the greeting ill; It is not that same clubb will beare you out And take this payment on thy shaggye crowne.— A blowe that brought him with a vengeance downe. Then Guy sett foot upon the monsters brest, And from his shoulders did his head divide, Which with a yawninge mouth did gape unblest, Noe dragons jawes were ever seene soe wide To open and to shut, till life was spent. Then Guy tooke keyes and to the castle went. Where manye woefull captives he did find, Which had beene tyred with extremitye, Whom he in freindly manner did unbind, And reasoned with them of their miserye: Eche told a tale with teares, and sighes, and cryes, All weeping to him with complaining eyes. There tender ladyes in darke dungeon lay, That were surprised in the desart wood, And had noe other dyett everye day, Than flesh of humane creatures for their food: Some with their lovers bodyes had beene fed, And in their wombes their husbands buryed. Now he bethinkes him of his being there, To enlarge the wronged brethren from their woes; And, as he searcheth, doth great clamours heare, By which sad sounds direction on he goes, Untill he findes a darksome obscure gate, Armd strongly ouer all with iron plate. That he unlockes, and enters, where appeares The strangest object that he ever saw; Men that with famishment of many yeares, Were like deathes picture, which the painters draw; Divers of them were hanged by eche thumb: Others head-downward: by the middle some. With diligence he takes them from the walls, With lybertye their thraldome to acquaint: Then the perplexed knight the father calls, And sayes, Receive thy sonnes though poore and faint: I promisd you their lives, accept of that; But did not promise you they shold be fat. The castle I doe give thee, heeres the keyes, Where tyranye for many yeeres did dwell: Procure the gentle tender ladyes ease, For pittyes sake, use wronged women well: Men easilye revenge the wrongs men do: But poore weake women have no strength thereto. The good old man, even overjoyed with this, Fell on the ground, and wold have kist Guys feete: Father, quoth he, refraine soe base a kiss, For age to honor youth I hold unmeete: Ambitious pryde hath hurt mee all it can, I goe to mortifie a sinfull man. The foregoing poem on Guy and Amarant has been discovered to be a fragment of, “the famous historie of Guy earl of Warwicke, by Samuel Rowlands. London, printed by J. Bell. 1649. 4to.” in xii cantos, beginning thus “When dreadful Mars in armour every day.” Whether the edition in 1649, was the first, is not known, but the author Sam. Rowlands was one of the minor poets, who lived in the reigns of Q. Elizabeth, and James I. and perhaps later. His other poems are chiefly of the religious kind, which makes it probable that the hist. of Guy was one of his earliest performance.—There are extant of his (1.) “The betraying of Christ, Judas in dispaire, the seven words of our Saviour on the crosse, with other poems on the passion, &amp;c. 1598. 4to. [Ames Typ. p. 428.]—(2.) A Theatre of delightful Recreation. Lond. printed for A. Johnson. 1605.” 4to. (Penes editor.) This is a book of poems on subjects chiefly taken from the old Testament. (3.) “Memory of Christ's miracles, in verse. Lond. 1618. 4to.” (4.) “Heaven's glory, earth's vanity, and hell's horror. Lond. 1638. 8vo. [These 2 in Bod. Cat.] III. THE AULD GOOD-MAN. A Scottish Song. We have not been able to meet with a more ancient copy of this humorous old song, than that printed in the Tea-Table miscellany, &amp;c. which seems to have admitted some corruptions. Late in an evening forth I went A little before the sun gade down, And there I chanc't, by accident, To light on a battle new begun: A man and his wife wer fawn in a strife, I canna weel tell ye how it began; But aye she wail'd her wretched life, Cryeng, Evir alake, mine auld goodman! He. Thy auld goodman, that thou tells of, The country kens where he was born, Was but a silly poor vagabond, And ilka ane leugh him to scorn: For he did spend and make an end Of gear ‘his fathers nevir’ wan; He gart the poor stand frae the door; Sae tell nae mair of thy auld goodman. She. My heart, alake! is liken to break, Whan I think on my winsome John, His blinkan ee, and gait sae free, Was naithing like thee, thou dosend drone; Wi' his rosie face, and flaxen hair, And skin as white as ony swan, He was large and tall, and comely withall; Thou'lt nevir be like mine auld goodman. He. Why dost thou plein? I thee maintein; For meal and mawt thou disna want; But thy wild bees I canna please, Now whan our gear gins to grow scant: Of houshold stuff thou hast enough; Thou wants for neither pot nor pan; Of sicklike ware he left thee bare; Sae tell nae mair of thy auld goodman. She. Yes I may tell, and fret my sell, To think on those blyth days I had, Whan I and he, together ley In armes into a well-made bed: But now I sigh and may be sad, Thy courage is cauld, thy colour wan, Thou falds thy feet and fa's asleep; Thou'lt nevir be like mine auld goodman. Then coming was the night sae dark, And gane was a' the light of day? The carle was fear'd to miss his mark, And therefore wad nae longer stay: Then up he gat, and ran his way, I trowe, the wife the day she wan; And aye the owreword of the fray Was, Evir alake! mine auld goodman. IV. FAIR MARGARET AND SWEET WILLIAM. This seems to be the old song quoted in Fletcher's “Knight of the burning pestle.” Acts 2d and 3d; altho' the six lines there preserved are somewhat different from those in the ballad, as it stands at present. The Reader will not wonder at this, when he is informed that this is only given from a modern printed copy picked up on a stall. It's full title is “Fair Margaret's Misfortunes; or Sweet William's frightful dreams on his wedding night, with the sudden death and burial of those noble lovers.”— The lines preserved in the play are this distich, “You are no love for me, Margaret, “I am no love for you.” And the following stanza, “When it was grown to dark midnight, “And all were fast asleep, “In came Margarets grimly ghost “And stood at William feet.” These lines have acquired an importance by giving birth to one of the most beautiful ballads in our own or any language. See the song intituled Margaret's Ghost, at the end of this volume. In this second edition some improvements are inserted, which were communicated by a lady of the first distinction, as she had heard this song repeated in her infancy. As it fell out on a long summer's day Two lovers they sat on a hill; They sat together that long summer's day, And could not talk their fill. I see no harm by you, Margarèt, And you see none by mee; Before to-morrow at eight o' the clock A rich wedding you shall see. Fair Margaret sate in her bower-windòw, Combing her yellow hair; There she spyed sweet William and his bride, As they were a riding near. Then down she layd her ivory combe, And braided her hair in twain: She went alive out of her bower, But ne'er came alive in't again. When day was gone, and night was come, And all men fast asleep, There came the spirit of fair Marg'ret, And stood at Williams feet. Are you awake, sweet William? she said; Or, sweet William, are you asleep? God give you joy of your gay bride-bed, And me of my winding-sheet. When day was come, and night was gone, And all men wak'd from sleep, Sweet William to his lady sayd, My dear, I have cause to weep. I dreamt a dream, my dear ladyè, Such dreames are never good: I dreamt my bower was full of red swine, And my bride-bed full of blood. Such dreams, such dreams, my honoured Sir, They never do prove good; To dream thy bower was full of ‘red’ swine, And thy bride-bed full of blood. He called up his merry men all, By one, by two, and by three; Saying, I'll away to fair Marg'rets bower, By the leave of my ladyè. And when he came to fair Marg'ret's bower, He knocked at the ring; And who so ready as her seven brethrèn To let sweet William in. Then he turned up the covering-sheet, Pray let me see the dead: Methinks she does look pale and wan, She has lost her cherry red. I'll do more for thee, Margarèt, Than any of thy kin; For I will kiss thy pale wan lips, Though a smile I cannot win. With that bespake the seven brethrèn, Making most piteous mone: You may go kiss your jolly brown bride, And let our sister alone. If I do kiss my jolly brown bride, I do but what is right; I neer made a vow to yonder poor corpse By day, nor yet by night. Deal on, deal on, my merry men all, Deal on your cake and your wine; For whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day, Shall be dealt to-morrow at mine. Fair Margaret dyed to-day, to-day, Sweet William dyed the morrow: Fair Margaret dyed for pure true love, Sweet William dyed for sorrow. Margaret was buryed in the lower chancèl, And William in the higher: Out of her brest there sprang a rose, And out of his a briar. They grew till they grew unto the church-top, And then they could grow no higher; And there they tyed in a true lovers knot, Which made all the people admire. Then came the clerk of the parìsh, As you the truth shall hear, And by misfortune cut them down, Or they had now been there. V. BARBARA ALLEN'S CRUELTY. Given, with some corrections, from an old printed copy in the editor's possession, intitled, “Barbara Allen's cruelty, or the young man's tragedy.” In Scarlet towne, where I was borne, There was a faire maid dwellin, Made every youth crye, wel-awaye! Her name was Barbara Allen. All in the merrye month of may, When greene buds they were swellin, Yong Jemmye Grove on his death-bed lay, For love of Barbara Allen. He sent his man unto her then, To the town, where shee was dwellin; You must come to my master deare, Giff your name be Barbara Allen. For death is printed on his face, And ore his hart is stealin: Then haste away to comfort him, O lovelye Barbara Allen. Though death be printed on his face, And ore his harte is stealin, Yet little better shall he bee, For bonny Barbara Allen. So slowly, slowly, she came up, And slowly she came nye him; And all she sayd, when there she came, Yong man, I think y'are dying. He turnd his face unto her strait, With deadlye sorrow sighing; O lovely maid, come pity mee, Ime on my death-bed lying. If on your death-bed you doe lye, What needs the tale you are tellin: I cannot keep you from your death; Farewell; sayd Barbara Allen. He turnd his face unto the wall, As deadlye pangs he fell in: Adieu! adieu! adieu to you all, Adieu to Barbara Allen. As she was walking ore the fields, She heard the bell a knellin; And every stroke did seem to saye, Unworthy Barbara Allen. She turnd her bodye round about, And spied the corps a coming: Laye downe, laye down the corps, she sayd, That I may look upon him. With scornful eye she looked downe, Her cheeke with laughter swellin; Whilst all her friends cryd out amaine, Unworthye Barbara Allen. When he was dead, and laid in grave, Her harte was struck with sorrowe, O mother, mother, make my bed, For I shall dye to morrowe. Hard harted creature him to slight, Who loved me so dearlye: O that I had beene more kind to him, When he was alive and neare me! She, on her death-bed as she laye, Beg'd to be buried by him: And sore repented of the daye, That she did ere denye him. Farewell, she sayd, ye virgins all, And shun the fault I fell in: Henceforth take warning by the fall Of cruel Barbara Allen. VI. SWEET WILLIAM'S GHOST. A Scottish Ballad. From Allan Ramsay's Tea Table miscellany. The concluding stanza of this piece seems modern. There came a ghost to Margaret's door, With many a grievous grone, And ay he tirled at the pin; But answer made she none. Is this my father Philip? Or is't my brother John? Or is't my true love Willie, From Scotland new come home? Tis not thy father Philip; Nor yet thy brother John: But tis thy true love Willie From Scotland new come home. O sweet Margret! O dear Margret! I pray thee speak to mee: Give me my faith and troth, Margret, As I gave it to thee. Thy faith and troth thou'se nevir get, ‘Of me shalt nevir win,’ Till that thou come within my bower, And kiss my cheek and chin. If I should come within thy bower, I am no earthly man: And should I kiss thy rosy lipp, Thy days will not be lang. O sweet Margret, O dear Margret, I pray thee speak to mee: Give me my faith and troth, Margret, As I gave it to thee. Thy faith and troth thou'se nevir get, ‘Of me shalt nevir win,’ Till thou take me to yon kirk yard, And wed me with a ring. My bones are buried in a kirk yard Afar beyond the sea, And it is but my sprite, Margret, That's speaking now to thee. She stretched out her lilly-white hand, As for to do her best: Hae there your faith and troth, Willie, God send your soul good rest. Now she has kilted her robes of green, A piece below her knee: And a' the live-lang winter night The dead corps followed shee. Is there any room at your head, Willie? Or any room at your feet? Or any room at your side, Willie, Wherein that I may creep? There's nae room at my head, Margret, There's nae room at my feet, There's no room at my side, Margret, My coffin is made so meet. Then up and crew the red red cock, And up then crew the gray: Tis time, tis time, my dear Margret, That you were gane away. No more the ghost to Margret said, But, with a grievous grone, Evanish'd in a cloud of mist, And left her all alone. O stay, my only true love, stay, The constant Margret cried: Wan grew her cheeks, she clos'd her een, Stretch'd her saft limbs, and died. VII. SIR JOHN GREHME AND BARBARA ALLAN. A Scottish Ballad. Printed, with a few conjectural emendations, from a written copy. It was in and about the Martinmas time, When the greene leaves wer a fallan; That Sir John Grehme o' the west countrye, Fell in luve wi' Barbara Allan. He sent his man down throw the towne, To the plaice wher she was dwellan: O haste and cum to my maister deare, Gin ye bin Barbara Allan. O hooly, hooly raise she up, To the plaice wher he was lyan; And whan she drew the curtain by, Young man, I think ye're dyan An ingenious friend thinks the rhymes Dyand and Lyand ought to be transposed; as the taunt Young man, I think ye're lyand, would be very characteristical.. O its I'm sick, and very very sick, And its a' for Barbara Allan: O the better for me ye'se never be, Though your harts blude wer spillan. Remember ye nat in the tavern, sir, Whan ye the cups wer fillan; How ye maide the healths gae round and round, And slighted Barbara Allan? He turn'd his face unto the wa' And death was with him dealan; Adiew! adiew! my dear friends a', Be kind to Barbara Allan. Then hooly, hooly raise she up, And hooly, hooly left him; And sighan said, she could not stay, Since death of life had reft him. She had not gane a mile but twa, Whan she heard the deid-bell knellan; And everye jow the deid-bell geid, Cried, wae to Barbara Allan! O mither, mither, mak my bed, O mak it saft and narrow: Since my luve died sor me to day, Ile die for him to morrowe. VIII. THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER OF ISLINGTON. From an ancient black-letter copy in the Pepys Collection, with some improvements communicated by a lady as she had heard the same recited in her youth. The full title is “True love requited: Or, the Bailiffs daughter of Islington.” Islington in Norfolk is probably the place here meant. There was a youthe, and a well-beloved youthe, And he was a squires son: He loved the bayliffes daughter deare, That lived in Islington. Yet she was coye and would not believe That he did love her soe, Noe nor at any time would she Any countenance to him showe. But when his friendes did understand His fond and foolish minde, They sent him up to faire London An apprentice for to binde. And when he had been seven long yeares, And never his love could see: Many a teare have I shed for her sake. When she little thought of mee. Then all the maids of Islington Went forth to sport and playe, All but the bayliffes daughter deare; She secretly stole awaye. She pulled off her gowne of greene, And put on ragged attire, And to faire London she would go Her true love to enquire. And as she went along the high-road, The weather being hot and drye, She sat her downe upon a green bank, And her true love came riding bye. She started up, with a colour soe redd, Catching hold of his bridle-reine; One penny, one penny, kind sir, she sayd, Will ease me of much paine. Before I give you one penny, sweet-heart, Praye tell me where you were borne. At Islington, kind sir, sayd shee, Where I have had many a scorne. I prythee, sweet-heart, then tell to mee, O tell me, whether you knowe The bayliffes daughter of Islington. She is dead, sir, long agoe. If she be dead, then take my horse, My saddle and my bowe; For I will into some farr countrye, Where noe man shall me knowe. O staye, O staye, thou goodlye youthe, She standeth by thy side; She is here alive, she is not dead, And readye to be thy bride. O farewell griefe, and welcome joye, Ten thousand times therefore; For nowe I have founde mine owne true love, Whom I thought I should never see more. IX. THE WILLOW-TREE. A Pastoral Dialogue. From the small black-letter collection, intitled, “The Golden Garland of princely delights;” collated with two other copies and corrected by conjecture. Willy. How now, shepherde, what meanes that? Why that willowe in thy hat? Why thy scarffes of red and yellowe Turn'd to branches of greene willowe? Cuddy. They are chang'd, and so am I; Sorrowes live, but pleasures die: Phillis hath forsaken mee, Which makes me weare the willowe-tree. Willy. Phillis! shee that lov'd thee long? Is shee the lass hath done thee wrong? Shee that lov'd thee long and best, Is her love turn'd to a jest? Cuddy. Shee that long true love profest, She hath robb'd my heart of rest: For she a new love loves, not mee; Which makes me wear the willowe-tree. Willy. Come then, shepherde, let us joine, Since thy happ is like to mine: For the maid I thought most true Mee hath also bid adieu. Cuddy. Thy hard happ doth mine appease, Companye doth sorrowe ease: Yet, Phillis, still I pine for thee, And still must weare the willowe-tree. Willy. Shepherde, be advis'd by mee, Cast off grief and willowe-tree: For thy grief brings her content, She is pleas'd if thou lament. Cuddy. Herdsman, I'll be rul'd by thee, There lyes grief and willowe-tree: Henceforth I will do as they, And love a new love every day. X. THE LADY'S FALL —is given from the editor's ancient folio MS, collated with two printed copies in black letter; one in the British Museum, the other in the Pepys collection. Its old title is, “A lamentable ballad of the Lady's fall. To the tune of, In Pescod Time, &amp;c.”—The ballad here referred to is preserved in the Muses Library 8vo. p. 281. It is an allegory or vision, intitled “The Shepherds Slumber,” and opens with some pretty rural images, viz. “In pescod time when bound to horn “Gives eare till buck be kil'd, “And little lads with pipes of corne “Sate keeping beasts a-field, “I went to gather strawberries “By woods and groves full fair,” &amp;c. Marke well my heavy dolefull tale, You loyall lovers all, And heedfully beare in your brest, A gallant ladyes fall. Long was she woo'd, ere she was wonne, To lead a wedded life, But folly wrought her overthrowe Before shee was a wife. Too soone, alas! shee gave consent And yeelded to his will, Though he protested to be true, And faithfull to her still. Shee felt her body altered quite, Her bright hue waxed pale, Her lovelye cheeks chang'd color white, Her strength began to fayle. Soe that with many a sorrowful sigh, This beauteous ladye milde, With greeved hart, perceiv'd herselfe To have conceiv'd with childe. Shee kept it from her parents sight As close as close might bee, And soe put on her silken gowne None might her swelling see. Unto her lover secretly Her greefe shee did bewray, And walking with him hand in hand, These words to him did say; Behold, quoth shee, a maids distresse By love brought to thy bowe, Behold I goe with childe by thee, But none thereof doth knowe. The little babe springs in my wombe To heare its fathers voyce, Lett it not be a bastard call'd, Sith I made thee my choyce: Come, come, my love, perform thy vowe And wed me out of hand; O leave me not in this extreme, In griefe alwayes to stand. Thinke on thy former promises, Thy oathes and vowes eche one; Remember with what bitter teares To mee thou madest thy moane. Convay me to some secrett place, And marry me with speede; Or with thy rapyer end my life, Ere further shame proceede. Alacke! my dearest love, quoth hee, My greatest joye on earthe, Which waye can I convay thee hence, Without a sudden death? Thy friends are all of hye degree, And I of meane estate; Full hard it is to gett thee forthe Out of thy fathers gate. Dread not thy life to save my fame, For if thou taken bee, My selfe will step betweene the swords, And take the harme on mee: Soe shall I scape dishonor quite; And if I should be slaine What could they say, but that true love Had wrought a ladyes bane. And feare not any further harme; My selfe will soe devise, That I will ryde away with thee Unknowne of mortal eyes: Disguised like some pretty page, Ile meete thee in the darke, And all alone Ile come to thee, Hard by my fathers parke. And there, quoth hee, Ile meete my deare If God soe lend me life, On this day month without all faile I will make thee my wife. Then with a sweet and loving kisse, They parted presentlye, And att their partinge brinish teares Stoode in eche others eye. Att length the wished day was come, On which this beauteous mayd, With longing eyes, and strange attire, For her true lover stayd: When any person shee espyed Come ryding ore the plaine, She hop'd it was her owne true love; But all her hopes were vaine. Then did shee weepe and sore bewayle Her most unhappy fate; Then did shee speake these woefull words, As succourless shee sate: O false, forsworne, and faithlesse man, Disloyall in thy love, Hast thou forgott thy promise past, And wilt thou perjur'd prove? And hast thou now forsaken mee In this my great distresse, To end my dayes in open shame, Which thou mightst well redresse? Woe worth the time I eer believ'd That flattering tongue of thine; Would God that I had never seene The teares of thy false eyne. And thus with many a sorrowful sigh, Homewards she went againe; Noe rest came in her waterye eyes, Shee felt such privye paine. In travail strong shee fell that night, With many a bitter throwe; What woefull pangs shee then did feel, Doth eche good woman knowe. Shee called up her waiting mayd, That lay at her bedds feete, Who musing at her mistress woe, Began full fast to weepe. Weepe not, said shee, but shutt the dores, And windowes round about, Let none bewray my wretched state, But keepe all persons out. O mistress, call your mother deare, Of women you have neede, And of some skilfull midwifes helpe, That better you may speed. Call not my mother for thy life, Nor fetch no women here, The midwifes helpe comes all too late, My death I doe not feare. With that the babe sprang from her wombe No creature being nye, And with one sighe, which brake her heart, This gallant dame did dye. The lovely little infant yonge, The mother being dead, Resigned its new received breath To him that had it made. Next morning came her own true love, Affrighted at the newes, And he for sorrow slew himselfe, Whom eche one did accuse. The mother with her new borne babe, Were both laid in one grave, Their parents overcome with woe, No joy thenceforth cold have. Take heed, you daintye damselles all, Of flattering words beware, And of the honour of your name Have an especial care. Too true, alas! this story is, As many one can tell. By others harmes learne to be wise, And you shall do full well. XI. WALY WALY, LOVE BE BONNY. A Scottish Song. This is a very ancient song, but we could only give it from modern copies. Some editions instead of the four last lines in the second stanza have these, which have too much merit to be wholly suppressed, “Whan cockle shells turn siller bells, “And muscles grow on every tree, “When frost and snaw sall warm us aw', “Than sall my love prove true to me.” See the Orpheus Caledonius, &amp;c. Arthur-seat mentioned in ver. 17. is a hill near Edinborough; at the bottom of which is St. Anthony's well. O Waly waly up the bank, And waly waly down the brae, And waly waly yon burn side, Where I and my love wer wont to gae. I leant my back unto an aik, I thought it was a trusty tree; But first it bow'd, and syne it brak, Sae my true love did lightly me. O waly, waly, gin love be bonny, A little time while it is new, But when its auld, it waxeth cauld, And fades awa' like morning dew. O wherfore shuld I busk my head? Or wherfore shuld I kame my hair? For my true love has me forsook, And says he'll never loe me mair. Now Arthur-seat sall be my bed, The sheets sall neir be fyl'd by me: Saint Anton's well sall be my drink, Since my true love has forsaken me. Marti'mas wind, whan wilt thou blaw, And shake the green leaves aff the tree? O gentle death, whan wilt thou cum? For of my life I am wearìe. Tis not the frost, that freezes fell, Nor blawing snaws inclemencìe; Tis not sic cauld, that makes me cry, But my loves heart grown cauld to me. Whan we came in by Glasgowe town, We were a comely sight to see, My love was cled i'th' black velvet, And I my sell in cramasìe. But had I wist, before I kisst, That love had been sae ill to win; I had lockt my heart in a case of gowd, And pinnd it with a siller pin. Oh oh! if my young babe were born, And set upon the nurses knee, And I my sell were dead and gane! For a maid again Ile never be. XII. THE WANTON WIFE OF BATH. From an ancient copy in black-print, in the Pepys collection. Mr. Addison has pronounced this an excellent ballad: See the Spectator, N?. 248. In Bath a wanton wife did dwelle, As Chaucer he doth write; Who did in pleasure spend her dayes, And many a fond delight. Upon a time sore sicke she was, And at the length did dye; And then her soul at heaven gate Did knocke most mightilye. First Adam came unto the gate: Who knocketh there? quoth hee. I am the wife of Bath, she sayd, And faine would come to thee. Thou art a sinner, Adam sayd, And here no place shalt have. And so art thou, I trowe, quoth shee; Now, gip, you doting knave. Gip, gep, or guep, is a common interjection of contempt in our old poets. See Gray's Hudibras, pt. 1. canto 3. v. 202. note. I will come in, in spight, she sayd, Of all such churles as thee; Thou wert the causer of our woe, Our paine and misery; And first broke Gods commandiments, In pleasure of thy wife.— When Adam heard her tell this tale, He ranne away for life. Then downe came Jacob at the gate, And bids her packe to hell; Thou false deceiving knave, quoth she, Thou mayst be there as well. For thou deceiv'dst thy father deare, And thine own brother too. Away ‘slunk’ Jacob presently, And made no more adoo. She knockes again with might and maine, And Lot he chides her straite. How now, quoth she, thou drunken ass, Who bade thee here to prate? With thy two daughters thou didst lye, On them two bastardes got. And thus most tauntingly she chast Against poor silly Lot. Who calleth there, quoth Judith then, With such shrill sounding notes? This fine minkes surely came not here, Quoth she, for cutting throats. Good Lord, how Judith blush'd for shame, When she heard her say soe! King David hearing of the same, He to the gate would goe. Quoth David, Who knockes there so loud, And maketh all this strife? You were more kinde, good Sir, she sayd, Unto Uriah's wife. And when thy servant thou didst cause In battle to be slaine; Thou causedst far more strife than I, Who would come here so faine. The woman's mad, quoth Solomon, That thus doth taunt a king. Not half so mad as you, she sayd I trowe, in manye a thing. Thou hadst seven hundred wives at once, For whom thou didst provide; And yet, god wot, three hundred whores Thou must maintaine beside: And they made thee forsake thy God, And worship stockes and stones; Besides the charge they put thee to In breeding of young bones. Hadst thou not bin beside thy wits, Thou wouldst not thus have ventur'd; And therefore I do marvel much, How thou this place hast enter'd. I never heard, quoth Jonas then, So vile a scold as this. Thou whore-son run-away, quoth she, Thou diddest more amiss. ‘They say’ quoth Thomas, womens tongues I think. P. Of aspen-leaves are made. Thou unbelieving wretch, quoth she, All is not true that's sayd. When Mary Magdalen heard her then, She came unto the gate. Quoth she, good woman, you must think Upon your former state. No sinner enters in this place Quoth Mary Magdalene. Then 'Twere ill for you, fair mistress mine, She answered her agen: You for your honestye, quoth she, Had once been ston'd to death; Had not our Saviour Christ come by, And written on the earth. It was not by your occupation, You are become divine: I hope my soul in Christ his passion, Shall be as safe as thine. Uprose the good apostle Paul, And to this wife he cryed, Except thou shake thy sins away, Thou here shalt be denyed. Remember, Paul, what thou hast done, All through a lewd desire: How thou didst persecute God's church, With wrath as hot as fire, Then up starts Peter at the last, And to the gate he hies: Fond fool, quoth he, knock not so fast, Thou weariest Christ with cries. Peter, said she, content thyselfe, For mercye may be won; I never did deny my Christ, As thou thyselfe hast done. When as our Saviour Christ heard this, With heavenly angels bright, He comes unto this sinful soul; Who trembled at his sight. Of him for mercye she did crave. Quoth he, thou hast refus'd My proffer'd grace, and mercy both, And much my name abus'd. Sore have I sinned, Lord, she sayd, And spent my time in vaine; But bring me like a wandring sheepe Into thy fold againe. O Lord my God, I will amend My former wicked vice: The thief for one poor silly word Past into paradise. My lawes and my commandiments, Saith Christ, were knowne to thee; But of the same in any wise, Not yet one word did yee. I grant the fame, O Lord, quoth she; Most lewdly did I live; But yet the loving father did His prodigal son forgive. So I forgive thy soul, he sayd, Through thy repenting crye; Come enter then into my rest, I will not thee denye. XIII. DULCINA. Given from two ancient copies, one in black-print, in the Pepys collection; the other in the editor's folio MS. The fourth stanza is not found in MS, and seems redundant. This song is quoted as very popular in Walton's Compleat Angler, chap. 2. It is more ancient than the song of Robin Good-Fellow printed below, which yet is supposed to have been written by Ben Jonson. As at noone Dulcina rested In her sweete and shady bower; Came a shepherd, and requested In her lappe to sleep an hour. But from her looke A wounde he tooke So deepe, that for a further boone The nymphe he prayes: Whereto she sayes, Foregoe me now, come to me soone. But in vayne shee did conjure him To departe her presence soe; Having a thousand tongues to allure him, And but one to bid him goe; Where lippes invite, And eyes delight, And cheekes, as fresh as rose in june, Persuade delay; What boots to say, Foregoe me now, come to me soone? He demands what time for pleasure Can there be more fit than now: She sayes, night gives love that leisure, Which the day doth not allow. He sayes, the sight ‘Improves delight: ‘Which shee denies; nights mirkie noone In Venus' playes Makes bold, she sayes; Foregoe me now, come to mee soone. But what promise or profession From his hands could purchase scope? Who would sell the sweet possession Of such beautye for a hope? Or for the sight Of lingering night Foregoe the present joyes of noone? Though ne'er soe faire Her speeches were, Foregoe me now, come to me soone. How, at last, agreed these lovers? Shee was fayre, and he was young: The tongue may tell what th'eye discovers; Joyes unseene are never sung. Did shee consent, Or he relent; Accepts hee night, or grants shee noone; Left he her mayd, Or not; she sayd Foregoe me now, come to me soone. XIV. THE LADY ISABELLA'S TRAGEDY. This ballad is given from an old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection, collated with another in the British Museum, H. 263. folio. It is there intitled, “The Lady Isabella's Tragedy, or the Step-Mother's Cruelty: being a relation of a lamentable and cruel murther, committed on the body of the lady Isabella, the only daughter of a noble duke, &amp;c. To the tune of the Lady's Fall.” To some copies are annexed eight more modern stanzas, intitled, “The Dutchess's and Cook's Lamentation.” There was a lord of worthy fame, And a hunting he would ride, Attended by a noble traine Of gentrye by his side. And while he did in chase remaine, To see both sport and playe; His ladye went, as she did feigne, Unto the church to praye. This lord he had a daughter deare, Whose beauty shone so bright, She was belov'd, both far and neare, Of many a lord and knight. Fair Isabella was she call'd, A creature faire was shee; She was her fathers only joye; As you shall after see. Therefore her cruel step-mothèr Did envye her so much; That daye by daye she sought her life, Her malice it was such. She bargain'd with the master-cook, To take her life awaye: And taking of her daughters book, She thus to her did saye. Go home, sweet daughter, I thee praye, Go hasten presentlìe; And tell unto the master-cook These wordes that I tell thee. And bid him dresse to dinner streight That faire and milk-white doe, That in the parke doth shine so bright, There's none so faire to showe. This ladye fearing of no harme, Obey'd her mothers will; And presentlye she hasted home, Her pleasure to fulfill. She streight into the kitchen went, Her message for to tell; And there she spied the master-cook, Who did with malice swell. Nowe, master-cook, it must be soe, Do that which I thee tell: You needes must dresse the milk-white doe, Which you do knowe full well. Then streight his cruell bloodye hands, He on the ladye layd; Who quivering and shaking stands, While thus to her he sayd: Thou art the doe, that I must dresse; See here, behold my knife; For it is pointed presently To ridd thee of thy life. O then, cried out the scullion-boye, As loud as loud might bee: O save her life, good master-cook, And make your pyes of mee! For pityes sake do not destroye My ladye with your knife; You know shee is her father's joye, For Christes sake save her life. I will not save her life, he sayd, Nor make my pyes of thee; Yet if thou dost this deed bewraye, Thy butcher I will bee. Now when this lord he did come home For to fit downe and eat; He called for his daughter deare, To come and carve his meat. Now sit you downe, his ladye sayd, O sit you downe to meat: Into some nunnery she is gone; Your daughter deare forget. Then solemnlye he made a vowe, Before the companìe: That he would neither eat nor drinke, Until he did her see. O then bespake the scullion-boye, With a loud voice so hye: If now you will your daughter see, My lord, cut up that pye: Wherein her fleshe is minced small, And parched with the fire; All caused by her step-mothèr, Who did her death desire. And cursed bee the master-cook, O cursed may he bee! I proffered him my own hearts blood, From death to set her free. Then all in blacke this lord did mourne; And for his daughters sake, He judged her cruell step-mothèr To be burnt at a stake. Likewise he judg'd the master-cook In boiling lead to stand; And made the simple scullion-boye The heire of all his land. XV. A HUE AND CRY AFTER CUPID. This Poem, which is in imitation of the first Idyllium of Moschus, is extracted from Ben Jonson's Masque at the marriage of lord viscount Hadington, on Shrove-Tuesday 1608. One stanza full of dry mythology we have omitted, as we found it dropt in a copy of this song printed in a small volume called “Le Prince d'amour. Lond. 1660.” 8vo. The hue and cry after Cupid is a kind of Translation of a pretty poem of Tasso's, called Amore fuggitivo, generally printed with his Aminta, and originally imitated from Moschus. Beauties, have yee seen a toy, Called Love, a little boy, Almost naked, wanton, blinde; Cruel now; and then as kinde? If he be amongst yee, say; He is Venus' run-away. Shee, that will but now discover Where the winged wag doth hover, Shall to-night receive a kisse, How and where herselfe would wish: But who brings him to his mother Shall have that kisse, and another. Markes he hath about him plentie; You may know him among twentie: All his body is a fire, And his breath a flame entire: Which, being shot like lightning in, Wounds the heart, but not the skin. Wings he hath, which though yee clip, He will leape from lip to lip, Over liver, lights, and heart; Yet not stay in any part. And, if chance his arrow misses, He will shoot himselfe in kisses. He doth beare a golden bow, And a quiver hanging low, Full of arrowes, which outbrave Dian's shafts; where, if he have Any head more sharpe than other, With that first he strikes his mother. Still the fairest are his fuell, When his daies are to be cruell; Lovers hearts are all his food, And his baths their warmest bloud: Nought but wounds his hand doth season, And he hates none like to Reason. Trust him not: his words, though sweet, Seldome with his heart doe meet: All his practice is deceit; Everie gift is but a bait: Not a kisse but poyson beares; And most treason in his teares. Idle minutes are his raigne; Then the straggler makes his gaine, By presenting maids with toyes And would have yee thinke hem joyes: 'Tis the ambition of the elfe, To have all childish, as himselfe. If by these yee please to know him, Beauties, be not nice, but show him. Though yee had a will to hide him, Now, we hope, yee'le not abide him, Since yee heare this falser's play, And that he is Venus' run-away. XVI. THE KING OF FRANCE'S DAUGHTER. The story of this Ballad seems to be taken from an incident in the domestic history of Charles the Bald, king of France. His daughter Judith was betrothed to Ethelwulph king of England: but before the marriage was consummated, Ethelwulph died, and she returned to France: whence she was carried off by Baldwyn, Forrester of Flanders; who after many crosses and difficulties, at length obtained the king's consent to their marriage, and was made Earl of Flanders. This happened about A. D. 863. —See Rapin, Henault, and the French Historians. The following copy is given from the editor's ancient folio MS. collated with another in black letter in the Pepys Collection, intitled, “An excellent Ballad of a prince of England's courtship to the king of France's daughter, &amp;c. To the tune of Crimson Velvet.” Many breaches having been made in this old song by the hand of time, principally (as might be expected) in the quick returns of the rhime; we have attempted to repair them. In the dayes of old, When faire France did flourish, Storyes plaine have told, Lovers felt annoye. The queene a daughter bare, Whom beautye's queene did nourish: She was lovelye faire, She was her fathers joye. A prince of England came, Whose deeds did merit fame, But he was exil'd, and outcast: Love his soul did fire, Shee granted his desire, Their hearts in one were linked fast. Which when her father proved, Sorelye he was moved, And tormented in his minde. He sought for to prevent them; And, to discontent them, Fortune cross'd these lovers kinde. When these princes twaine Were thus barr'd of pleasure, Through the kinges disdaine, Which their joyes withstoode: The lady soone prepar'd Her jewells and her treasure; Having no regard For state and royall bloode; In homelye poore array She went from court away, To meet her joye and hearts delight; Who in a forrest great Had taken up his seat, To wayt her coming in the night. But, lo! what sudden danger To this princely stranger Chanced, as he sate alone! By outlawes he was robbed, And with ponyards stabbed, Uttering many a dying grone. The princesse, arm'd by love, And by chaste desire, All the night did rove Without dread at all: Still unknowne she past In her strange attire; Coming at the last Within echoes call,— You faire woods, quoth shee, Honoured may you bee, Harbouring my hearts delight; Which encompass here My joye and only deare, My trustye friend, and comelye knight. Sweete, I come unto thee, Sweete, I come to woo thee; That thou mayst not angrye bee For my long delaying; For thy curteous staying Soone amendes Ile make to thee. Passing thus alone Through the silent forest, Many a grievous grone Sounded in her eares: She heard one complayne And lament the sorest, Seeming all in payne, Shedding deadly teares. Farewell, my deare, quoth hee, Whom I must never see; For why my life is att an end, Through villaines crueltye: For thy sweet sake I dye, To show I am a faithfull friend. Here I lye a bleeding, While my thoughts are feeding On the rarest beautye found. O hard happ, that may be! Little knowes my ladye My heartes blood lyes on the ground. With that a grone he sends Which did burst in sunder All the tender ‘bands’ Of his gentle heart. She, who knewe his voice, At his wordes did wonder; All her former joyes Did to griefe convert. Strait she ran to see, Who this man shold bee, That soe like her love did seeme: Her lovely lord she found Lye slaine upon the ground, Smear'd with gore a ghastlye streame. Which his lady spying, Shrieking, fainting, crying, Her sorrows could not uttered bee: Fate, she cryed, too cruell! For thee—my dearest jewell, Would God! that I had dyed for thee. His pale lippes, alas! Twentye times she kissed, And his face did wash With her trickling teares: Every gaping wound Tenderlye she pressed, And did wipe it round With her golden haires. Speake, faire love, quoth shee, Speake, faire prince, to mee, One sweete word of comfort give: Lift up thy deare eyes, Listen to my cryes, Thinke in what sad griefe I live. All in vaine she sued, All in vaine she wooed, The prince's life was fled and gone. There stood she still mourning, Till the suns retourning, And bright day was coming on. In this great distresse Weeping, wayling ever, Oft shee cryed, alas! What will become of mee? To my fathers court I returne will never: But in lowlye sort Will a servant bee. While thus she made her mone, Weeping all alone, In this deepe and deadlye feare: A for'ster all in greene, Most comelye to be seene, Ranging the woods did find her there: Moved with her sorrowe, Maid, quoth he, good morrowe, What hard happ has brought thee here? Harder happ did never Two kinde hearts dissever: Here lyes slaine my brother deare. Where may I remaine, Gentle for'ster, shew me, Till I can obtaine A service in my neede? Paines I will not spare: This kinde favour doe me, It will ease my care; Heaven shall be thy meede. The for'ster all amazed, On her beautye gazed, Till his heart was set on fire, If, faire maid, quoth hee, You will goe with mee, You shall have your hearts desire. He brought her to his mother, And above all other He sett forth this maidens praise. Long was his heart inflamed, At length her love he gained, And fortune crown'd his future dayes. Thus unknowne he wedde With a kings faire daughter; Children seven they had, Ere she told her birth. Which when once he knew, Humblye he besought her, He to the world might shew Her rank and princelye worth. He cloath'd his children then, (Not like other men) In partye-colours strange to see; The right side cloth of gold, The left side to behold, Of woollen cloth still framed hee This will remind the reader of the livery and device of Charles Brandon, a private gentleman, who married the Queen Dowager of France, sister of Henry VIII. At a tournament which he held at his wedding, the trappings of his horse were half Cloth of gold, and half Frieze, with the following Motto, “Cloth of Gold, do not dispise, “Tho' thou art matcht with Cloth of Frize; “Cloth of Frize, be not too bold, “Tho' thou art matcht with Cloth of Gold.” See Sir W. Temple's Misc. vol. 3. p. 336.. Men thereatt did wonder; Golden fame did thunder This strange deede in every place: The king of France came thither, It being pleasant weather, In these woods the hart to chase. The children then they bring, So their mother will'd it, Where the royall king Must of force come bye: Their mothers riche array, Was of crimson velvet: Their fathers all of gray, Seemelye to the eye. Then this famous king, Noting every thing, Askt how he durst be so bold To let his wife soe weare, And decke his children there, In costly robes of pearl and gold. The forrester replying, And the cause descrying i. e. describing. See Gloss., To the king these words did say, Well may they, by their mother, Weare rich clothes with other, Being by birth a princesse gay. The king aroused thus, More heedfullye beheld them, Till a crimson blush His remembrance crost. The more I fix my mind On thy wife and children, The more methinks I find The daughter which I lost. Falling on her knee, I am that child, quoth shee; Pardon mee, my soveraine liege. The king perceiving this, His daughter deare did kiss, While joyfull teares did stopp his speeche. With his traine he tourned. And with them sojourned. Strait he dubb'd her husband knight; Then made him erle of Flanders, And chiefe of his commanders: Thus were their sorrowes put to flight. XVII. THE SWEET NEGLECT. This little madrigal (extracted from Ben Jonson's Silent Woman, Act 1. Sc. 1. First acted in 1609.) is in imitation of a Latin poem printed at the end of the Variorum Edit. of Petronius, beginning ‘Semper munditias, semper Basilissa, decoras, &amp;c.”’ See Whalley's Ben Jonson, vol. 2. p. 420. Still to be neat, still to be drest, As you were going to a feast: Still to be pou'dred, still perfum'd: Lady, it is to be presum'd, Though art's hid causes are not found, All is not sweet, all is not sound. Give me a looke, give me a face, That makes simplicitie a grace; Robes loosely flowing, haire as free: Such sweet neglect more taketh me, Than all th'adulteries of art, That strike mine eyes, but not my heart. XVIII. THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD. The subject of this very popular ballad (which has been set in so favourable a light by the Spectator, N?. 85.) seems to be taken from an old play, intitled, “Two lamentable Tragedies, The one of the murder of Maister Beech, a chandler in Thames-streete, &amp;c. The other of a young child murthered in a wood by two ruffins, with the consent of his unkle. By Rob. Yarrington, 1601. 4to.” Our ballad-maker has strictly followed the play in the description of the father and mother's dying charge: in the uncle's promise to take care of their issue: his hiring two ruffians to destroy his ward, under pretence of sending him to school: their chusing a wood to perpetrate the murder in: one of the ruffians relenting, and a battle ensuing, &amp;c. In other respects he has departed from the play. In the latter the scene is laid in Padua: there is but one child: which is murdered by a sudden stab of the unrelenting ruffian: he is slain himself by his less bloody companion, but ere he dies gives the other a mortal wound: the latter living just long enough to impeach the uncle: who in consequence of this impeachment is arraigned and executed by the hand of justice, &amp;c. Whoever compares the play with the ballad, will have no doubt but the former is the original: the language is far more obsolete, and such a vein of simplicity runs thro' the whole performance, that had the ballad been written first, there is no doubt but every circumstance of it would have been received into the drama: whereas this was probably built on some Italian novel. Printed from two ancient copies, one of them in black letter in the Pepys Collection. It's title at large is, “The Children in the Wood: or, The Norfolk Gentleman's Last Will and Testament: To the tune of Rogero, &amp;c.” Now ponder well, you parents deare, These wordes, which I shall write; A doleful story you shall heare, In time brought forth to light: A gentleman of good account In Norfolke dwelt of late, Who did in honour far surmount Most men of his estate. Sore sicke he was, and like to dye, No helpe his life could save; His wife by him as sicke did lye, And both possest one grave. No love between these two was lost, Each was to other kinde, In love they liv'd, in love they dyed, And left two babes behinde: The one a fine and pretty boy, Not passing three yeares olde; The other a girl more young than he, And fram'd in beautyes molde. The father left his little son, As plainly doth appeare, When he to perfect age should come, Three hundred poundes a yeare. And to his little daughter Jane Five hundred poundes in gold, To be paid downe on marriage-day, Which might not be controll'd: But if the children chance to dye, Ere they to age should come, Their uncle should possesse their wealth; For so the wille did run. Now, brother, said the dying man, Look to my children deare; Be good unto my boy and girl, No friendes else have they here: To God and you I recommend My children deare this daye; But little while be sure we have Within this world to staye. You must be father and mother both, And uncle all in one; God knowes what will become of them, When I am dead and gone. With that bespake their mother deare, O brother kinde, quoth shee, You are the man must bring our babes To wealth or miserie. And if you keep them carefully, Then God will you reward; But if you otherwise should deal, God will your deedes regard. With lippes as cold as any stone, They kist their children small: God bless you both, my children deare; With that the teares did fall. These speeches then their brother spake To this sicke couple there, The keeping of your little ones Sweet sister, do not feare; God never prosper me nor mine, Nor aught else that I have, If I do wrong your children deare, When you are layd in grave. The parents being dead and gone, The children home he takes, And bringes them straite unto his house, Where much of them he makes. He had not kept these pretty babes A twelvemonth and a daye, But, for their wealth, he did devise To make them both awaye. He bargain'd with two ruffians strong, Which were of furious mood, That they should take these children young, And slaye them in a wood: He told his wife an artful tale, He would the children send To be brought up in faire Londòn, With one that was his friend. Away then went these pretty babes, Rejoycing at that tide, Rejoycing with a merry minde, They should on cock-horse ride. They prate and prattle pleasantly, As they rode on the waye, To those that should their butchers be, And work their lives decaye. So that the pretty speeche they had, Made Murder's heart relent; And they that undertooke the deed, Full sore did now repent. Yet one of them more hard of heart, Did vowe to do his charge, Because the wretch, that hired him, Had paid him very large. The other won't agree thereto, So here they fall to strife; With one another they did fight, About the childrens life: And he that was of mildest mood, Did slaye the other there, Within an unfrequented wood, While babes did quake for feare. He took the children by the hand, Teares standing in their eye, And bad them straitwaye follow him, And look they did not crye: And two long miles he ledd them on, While they for food complaine: Staye here, quoth he, I'll bring you bread, When I come back againe. These pretty babes, with hand in hand, Went wandering up and downe; But never more could see the man Approaching from the town: Their prettye lippes with black-berries, Were all besmear'd and dyed, And when they sawe the darksome night, They sat them downe and cryed. Thus wandered these poor innocents, Till deathe did end their grief, In one anothers armes they dyed, As wanting due relief: No burial ‘this’ pretty ‘pair’ these . . babes. P P. Of any man receives, Till Robin-red-breast piously Did cover them with leaves. And now the heavy wrathe of God Upon their uncle fell; Yea, fearfull fiends did haunt his house, His conscience felt an hell: His barnes were fir'd, his goodes consum'd, His landes were barren made, His cattle dyed within the field, And nothing with him stayd. And in a voyage to Portugal Two of his sonnes did dye; And to conclude, himselfe was brought To want and miserye: He pawn'd and mortgaged all his land Ere seven yeares came about. And now at length this wicked act Did by this meanes come out: The fellowe, that did take in hand These children for to kill, Was for a robbery judged to dye, Such was Gods blessed will; Who did confess the very truth, As here hath been display'd: Their uncle having dyed in gaol, Where he for debt was layd. You that executors be made, And overseers eke Of children that be fatherless, And infants mild and meek; Take you example by this thing, And yield to each his right, Lest God with such like miserye Your wicked minds requite. XIX. A LOVER OF LATE. From the Editor's folio Manuscript. A lover of late was I, For Cupid would have it soe, The boye that hath never an eye, As everye man doth knowe: I sighed and sobbed, and cryed, alas! For her that laught, and call'd me ass. Then knew not I what to doe, When I saw it was all in vaine A ladye so coy to woe, Who gave me the asse so plaine: Yet would I her asse freelye bee, Soe shee would helpe and beare with mee. An' I were as faire as shee, Or shee were as fond as I, What paire could have made, as wee, So prettye a sympathye: I was as fond as shee was faire, But for all this we could not paire. Paire with her that will for mee, With her I will never paire; That cunningly can be coy, For being a little faire. The asse I'll leave to her disdaine; And now I am myselfe againe. XX. THE KING AND MILLER OF MANSFIELD. It has been a favourite subject with our English ballad-makers to represent our kings conversing, either by accident or design, with the meanest of their subjects. Of the former kind, besides this song of the King and the Miller; we have K. Henry and the Soldier; K. James I. and the Tinker; K. William III. and the Forrester, &amp;c. Of the latter sort, are K. Alfred and the Shepherd; K. Edward IV. and the Tanner; K. Henry VIII. and the Cobler, &amp;c.—A few of the best of these we have admitted into this collection. Both the author of the following ballad, and others who have written on the same plan, seem to have copied a very ancient poem, intitled John the Reeve, which is built on an adventure of the same kind, that happened between K. Edward Longshanks, and one of his Reeves or Bailiffs. This is a piece of great antiquity, being written before the time of Edward IV. and for its genuine humour, diverting incidents, and faithful picture of rustic manners, is infinitely superior to all that have been since written in imitation of it. The editor has a copy in his ancient folio MS. but its length rendered it improper for this volume, it consisting of more than 900 lines. It contains also some corruptions, and the editor chuses to defer its publication in hopes that some time or other he shall be able to remove them. The following is printed from the editor's ancient folio MS. collated with an old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection, intitled “A pleasant ballad of K. Henry II. and the Miller of Mansfield, &amp;c.” Part the First. Henry, our royall king, would ride a hunting To the greene forest so pleasant and faire; To see the harts skipping, and dainty does tripping: Unto merry Sherwood his nobles repaire: Hawke and hound were unbound, all things prepar'd; For the game, in the same, with good regard. All a long summers day rode the king pleasantlye, With all his princes and nobles eche one; Chasing the hart and hind, and the bucke gallantlye, Till the dark evening forc'd all to turne home. Then at last, riding fast, he had lost quite All his lords in the wood, late in the night. Wandering thus wearilye, all alone, up and downe, With a rude miller he mett at the last: Asking the ready way unto faire Nottingham; Sir, quoth the miller, I meane not to jest, Yet I thinke, what I thinke, sooth for to say, You doe not lightlye ride out of your way. Why, what dost thou think of me, quoth our king merrily, Passing thy judgment upon me so briefe? Good faith, sayd the miller, I meane not to flatter thee; I guess thee to bee but some gentleman thiefe: Stand thee backe, in the darke; light not adowne, Lest that I presentlye cracke thy knaves crowne. Thou dost abuse me much, quoth the king, saying thus; I am a gentleman; lodging doe lacke. Thou hast not, quoth th'miller, one groat in thy purse; All thy inheritance hanges on thy backe. I have gold to discharge all that I call If it be forty pence, I will pay all. If thou beest a true man, then quoth the miller, I sweare by my toll-dish, I'll lodge thee all night. Here's my hand, quoth the king, that was I ever. Nay, soft, quoth the miller, thou may'st be a sprite. Better I'll know thee, ere hands we will shake; With none but honest men hands will I take. Thus they went all along unto the millers house; Where they were seething of puddings and souse: The miller first enter'd in, after him went the king; Never came hee in soe smoakye a house. Now, quoth hee, let me see here what you are. Quoth our king, looke your fill, and doe not spare. I like well thy countenance, thou hast an honest face; With my son Richard this night thou shalt lye. Quoth his wise, by my troth, it is a handsome youth, Yet it's best, husband, to deal warilye. Art thou no run-away, prythee, youth, tell? Shew me thy passport, and all shal be well. Then our king presentlye, making lowe courtesye, With his hatt in his hand, thus he did say; I have no passport, nor never was servitor, But a poor courtyer, rode out of my way: And for your kindness here offered to mee, I will requite you in everye degree: Then to the miller his wife whisper'd secretlye, Saying, it seemeth, this youth's of good kin, Both by his apparel, and eke by his manners; To turne him out, certainlye, were a great sin. Yea, quoth hee, you may see, he hath some grace, When he doth speake to his betters in place. Well, quo' the millers wife, young man, ye're welcome here; And, though I say it, well lodged shall be: Fresh straw will I have, laid on thy bed so brave, And good brown hempen sheetes likewise, quoth shee. Aye, quoth the good man; and when that is done, Thou shalt lye with no worse, than our own sonne. Nay, first, quoth Richard, good-fellowe, tell me true, Hast thou noe creepers within thy gay hose? Or art thou not troubled with the scabbado? I pray, quoth the king, what creatures are those? Art thou not lowsy, nor scabby? quoth he: If thou beest, surely thou lyest not with mee. This caus'd the king, suddenlye, to laugh most heartilye, Till the teares trickled fast downe from his eyes. Then to their supper were they set orderlye, With hot bag-puddings, and good apple-pyes; Nappy ale, good and stale, in a browne bowle, Which did about the board merrilye trowle. Here, quoth the miller, good fellowe, I drinke to thee, And to all ‘cuckolds, wherever they bee.’ courtnalls, that courteous be. MS. and P. I pledge thee, quoth our king, and thanke thee heartilye For my good welcome in everye degree: And here, in like manner, I drinke to thy sonne. Do then, quoth Richard, and quicke let it come. Wife, quoth the miller, fetch me forth lightfoote, That we of his sweetnesse a little may taste: A fair ven'son pastye brought she out presentlye; Eate, quoth the miller, but, sir, make no waste. Here's dainty lightfoote, in faith, sayd the king, I never before eate so daintye a thing. I wis, quoth Richard, no daintye at all it is, For we doe eate of it everye day. In what place, sayd our king, may be bought like to this? We never pay pennye for itt, by my fay: From merry Sherwood we fetch it home here; Now and then we make bold with our kings deer. Then I thinke, sayd our king, that it is venison. Eche foole, quoth Richard, full well may know that: Never are wee without two or three in the roof, Very well fleshed, and excellent fat: But, prythee, say nothing wherever thou goe; We wold not, for two pence, the king should it knowe. Doubt not, then sayd the king, my promist secresye; The king shall never know more on't for mee. A cupp of lambs-wool they dranke unto him then, And to their bedds they past presentlie. The nobles, next morning, went all up and down, For to seeke out the king in everye towne. At last, at the millers ‘cott’, soone they espy'd him out, As he was mounting upon his faire steede; To whom they came presently, falling down on their knee; Which made the millers heart wofully bleede: Shaking and quaking, before him he stood, Thinking he should have been hang'd, by the rood. The king perceiving him fearfully trembling, Drew forth his sword, but nothing he sed: The miller downe did fall, crying before them all, Doubting the king would have cut off his head: But he his kind courtesye for to requite, Gave him great living, and dubb'd him a knight. Part the Second. When as our royall king came home from Nottingham, And with his nobles at Westminster lay; Recounting the sports and pastimes they had taken, In this late progress along on the way; Of them all, great and small, he did protest, The miller of Mansfield's sport liked him best. And now, my lords, quoth the king, I am determined Against St. Georges next sumptuous feast, That this old miller, our new confirmed knight, With his son Richard, shall here be my guest: For, in this merryment, 'tis my desire To talke with the jolly knight, and the young squire. When as the noble lords saw the kinges pleasantness, They were right joyfull and glad in their hearts; A pursuivant there was sent straight on the business, The which had often-times been in those parts. When he came to the place, where they did dwell, His message orderlye then 'gan he tell. God save your worshippe, then said the messenger, And grant your ladye her owne hearts desire; And to your sonne Richard good fortune and happiness; That sweet, gentle, and gallant young squire. Our king greets you well, and thus he doth say, You must come to the court on St. Georges day; Therfore, in any case, faile not to be in place. I wis, quoth the miller, this is an odd jest: What should we doe there? faith, I am halfe afraid. I doubt, quoth Richard, to be hang'd at the least. Nay, quoth the messenger, you doe mistake; Our king he provides a great feast for your sake. Then sayd the miller, By my troth, messenger, Thou hast contented my worshippe full well. Hold here are three farthings, to quite thy gentleness, For these happy tydings, which thou dost tell. Let me see, hear thou mee; tell to our king, We'll wayt on his mastershipp in everye thing. The pursuivant smiled at their simplicitye, And, making many leggs, tooke their reward; And taking then his leave with great humilitye To the kings court againe he repair'd; Shewing unto his grace, merry and free, The knightes most liberall gift and bountie. When he was gone away, thus gan the miller say, Here come expences and charges indeed; Now must we needs be brave, tho' we spend all we have; For of new garments we have great need: Of horses and serving-men we must have store, With bridles and saddles, and twentye things more. Tushe, sir John, quoth his wife, why should you frett, or frowne? You shall n'er be att no charges for mee; For I will turne and trim up my old russet gowne, With everye thing else as fine as may bee; And on our mill-horses swift we will ride, With pillowes and pannells as we shall provide. In this most statelye sort, rode they unto the court, Their jolly sonne Richard rode foremost of all; Who set up, by good hap, a cocks feather in his cap, And so they jetted downe to the kings hall; The merry old miller with hands on his side; His wife, like maid Marian, did mince at that tide. The king and his nobles, that heard of their coming, Meeting this gallant knight with his brave traine; Welcome, sir knight, quoth he, with your gay lady: Good sir John Cockle, once welcome againe: And so is the squire of courage soe free. Quoth Dicke, Abots on you; do you know mee? Quoth our king gentlye, how should I forget thee? That wast my owne bed-fellow, well it I wot. Yea, sir, quoth Richard, and by the same token, Thou with thy farting didst make the bed hot. Thou whore-son unhappy knave, then quoth the knight, Speake cleanly to our king, or else go shite. The king and his courtiers laugh at this heartily, While the king taketh them both by the hand; With ladyes and their maids, like to the queen of spades The millers wife did soe orderly stand, A milk-maids courtesye at every word; And downe the folkes were set to the board: Where the king royally, in princelye majestye, Sate at his dinner with joy and delight; When they had eaten well, then hee to jesting fell, And in a bowle of wine dranke to the knight: Here's to you both, in wine, ale and beer; Thanking you heartilye for my good cheer. Quoth sir John Cockle, I'll pledge you a pottle, Were it the best ale in Nottinghamshire: But then said our king, now I think of a thing; Some of your lightfoote I would we had here. Ho! ho! quoth Richard, full well I may say it, 'Tis knavery to eate it, and then to betray it. Why art thou angry? quoth our king merrilye; In faith, I take it now very unkind: I thought thou wouldst pledge me in ale and wine heartily. Quoth Dicke, You are like to stay till I have din'd: You feed us with twatling dishes soe small; Zounds, a blacke-pudding is better than all. Aye, marry, quoth our king, that were a daintye thing, Could a man get but one here for to eate. With that Dicke straite arose, and pluckt one from his hose, Which with heat of his breech gan to sweate. The king made a proffer to snatch it away:— 'Tis meat for your master: good sir, you must stay. Thus in great merriment was the time wholly spent; And then the ladyes prepared to dance: Old Sir John Cockle, and Richard, incontinent Unto their paces the king did advance: Here with the ladyes such sport they did make, The nobles with laughing did make their sides ake. Many thankes for their paines did the king give them, Asking young Richard then, if he would wed; Among these ladyes free, tell me which liketh thee? Quoth he, Jugg Grumball, Sir, with the red head: She's my love, she's my life, her will I wed; She hath sworn I shall have her maidenhead. Then sir John Cockle the king call'd unto him, And of merry Sherwood made him o'er-seer; And gave him out of hand three hundred pound yearlye; Now take heede you steale no more of my deer: And once a quarter let's here have your view; And now, sir John Cockle, I bid you adieu. XXI. THE SHEPHERD'S RESOLUTION. This beautiful old song was written by a poet, whose name would have been utterly forgotten, if it had not been preserved by Swift, as a term of contempt. “Dryden and Wither” are coupled by him like the Bavius and Mævius of Virgil. Dryden however has had justice done him by posterity: and as for Wither, though of subordinate merit, that he was not altogether devoid of genius, will be judged from the following stanzas. The truth is, Wither was a very voluminous party-writer: and as his political and satyrical strokes rendered him extremely popular in his life time; so afterwards, when their date was out, they totally consigned his writings to oblivion. George Wither was born June 11. 1588, and in his younger years distinguished himself by some pastoral pieces, that were not inelegant; but growing afterwards involved in the political and religious disputes in the times of James I, and Charles I, he employed his poetical vein in severe pasquils on the court and clergy, and was occasionally a sufferer for the freedom of his pen. In the civil war that ensued, he exerted himself in the service of the Parliament, and became a considerable sharer in the spoils. He was even one of those provincial tyrants, whom Oliver distributed over the kingdom, under the name of Major Generals; and had the fleecing of the county of Surrey: but surviving the Restoration, he outlived both his power and his affluence; and giving vent to his chagrin in libels on the court, was long a prisoner in Newgate and the Tower. He died at length on the 2d of May, 1667. During the whole course of his life, Wither was a continual publisher; having generally for opponent, Taylor the Water-poet. The long list of his productions may be seen in Wood's Athænæ. Oxon. vol. 2. His most popular satire, is intitled, “Abuses whipt and stript.” 1613. His most poetical pieces were eclogues, intitled, “The Shepherd's Hunting.” 1615, 8vo. and others printed at the end of Browne's “Shepherd's Pipe.” 1614. 8vo. The following sonnet is extracted from a long pastoral piece of his, intitled, “The Mistresse of Philarete.” 8vo. which is said in the preface to be one of the Author's first poems: and may therefore be dated as early as any of the foregoing. Shall I, wasting in dispaire, Dye because a woman's faire? Or make pale my cheeks with care, 'Cause another's rosie are? Be shee fairer then the day, Or the flowry meads in may; If she think not well of me, What care I how faire shee be? Shall my heart be griev'd or pin'd, Cause I see a woman kind? Or a well-disposed nature Joyned with a lovely feature? Be shee meeker, kinder, than The turtle-dove or pelican: If shee be not so to me, What care I how kind shee be? Shall a womans virtues move Me, to perish for her love? Or, her well deservings knowne, Make me quite forget mine owne? Be shee with that goodnesse blest, Which may merit name of Best; If she be not such to me, What care I how good she be? Cause her fortune seemes too high, Shall I play the foole and dye? Those that beare a noble minde, Where they want of riches find, Thinke what with them they would doe, That without them dare to woe; And, unlesse that minde I see, What care I, though great she be? Great or good, or kind or faire, I will ne'er the more dispaire: If she love me, this beleeve; I will die ere she shall grieve. If she slight me, when I wooe; I can scorne and let her goe: For, if shee be not for me, What care I for whom she be? XXII. THE WANDERING PRINCE OF TROY. This excellent old ballad, which perhaps ought to have been placed earlier in the volume, is given from the editor's folio MS. collated with two different printed copies, both in black letter in the Pepys collection. The reader will smile to observe with what natural and affecting simplicity, our ancient ballad-maker has engrafted a Gothic conclusion on the classic story of Virgil, from whom, however, it is probable he had it not. Nor can it be denied, but he has dealt out his poetical justice with a more impartial hand, than that celebrated poet. When Troy towne had, for ten yeares ‘past,’ war. MS. and PP. Withstood the Greeks in manful wise, Then did their foes increase so fast, That to resist nought could suffice: Waste lye those walls, that were soe good, And corn now grows where Troy towne stood. Æneas, wandering prince of Troy, When he for land long time had sought, At length arriving with great joy, To mighty Carthage walls was brought; Where Dido queen, with sumptuous feast, Did entertaine this wandering guest. And, as in hall at meate they sate, The queen, desirous newes to hear, ‘Says, of thy Troys unhappy fate’ Declare to me thou Trojan dear: The heavy hap and chance so bad, Which thou, poore wandering prince, hast had. And then anon this comely knight, With words demure, as he could well, Of their unhappy ten yeares ‘fight’, war. MS. and PP. So true a tale began to tell, With words so sweet, and sighs so deepe, That oft he made them all to weepe. And then a thousand sighes he set, And everye sighe brought teares amaine; That where he sate the place was wet, As though he had seene those warrs againe; Soe that the queene, with ruth therefore Sayd, worthye prince, enough, no more. And now the darksome night drew on, And twinkling starres the skye bespred; When he his dolefull tale had done, And everye one was laid in bed: Where they full sweetlye took their rest, Save only Dido's boyling breast. This seely woman never slept, But in her chamber, all alone, As one unhappy, alwaies wept, And to the walls shee made her mone; That shee should still desire in vaine The thing, she never must obtaine. And thus in griefe shee spent the night, Till twinkling starres the skye were fled, And Phœbus, with his glistering light, Through misty cloudes appeared red; Then tidings came to her anon, That all the Trojan shipps were gone. And then the queene against her life Did arme her heart as hard as stone, Yet, ere she bared the bloody knife, In woefull wise shee made her mone; And, rolling on her carefull bed, With sighes and sobs, these words shee sed: O wretched Dido queene! quoth shee, I see thy end approacheth neare; For he is fled away from thee, Whom thou didst love and hold so deare: What is he gone, and passed bye? O heart, prepare thyself to dye. In vaine thou pleadst I should forbeare, And stay my hand from bloody stroke; Thee, treacherous heart, I must not spare, Which fettered me in Cupids yoke. Come death, quoth shee, resolve my smart:— And with those words she pierc'd her heart. When death had pierc'd the tender heart Of Dido, Carthaginian queene; Whose bloody knife did end the smart, Which shee sustain'd in mournfull teene; Æneas being shipt and gone, Whose flattery caused all her mone; Her funerall most costly made, And all things finisht mournfullye; Her bodye fine in mold was laid, Where itt consumed speedilye: Her sisters teares her tombe bestrew'd; Her subjects griefe their kindnesse shew'd. Then was Æneas in an isle In Grecia, where he stay'd long space, Whereatt her sister in short while, Writt to him to his vile disgrace; In speeches bitter to his minde Shee told him plaine, hee was unkinde. False-hearted wretch, quoth shee, thou art; And traiterouslye thou hast betraid Unto thy lure a gentle heart, Which unto thee much welcome made; My sister deare, and Carthage' joy, Whose folly bred her dere annoy. Yet on her death-bed when shee laye, Shee prayed for thy prosperitye, Beseeching god, that every day Might breed thee great felicitye: Thus by thy meanes I lost a friend; Heaven send thee such untimely end. When he these lines, full fraught with gall, Perused had, and weighed them right, His lofty courage 'gan to fall; And straight appeared in his sight Queene Dido's ghost, both grim and pale; Which made this valliant souldier quail. Æneas, quoth this ghastly ghost, My whole delight while I did live, Thee of all men I loved most; To thee my fancye I did give; And for the welcome I thee gave, Unthankfully thou didst me grave. Therefore prepare thy fleeting soule To wander with me in the ayre; Where deadlye griefe shall make it howle, Because of me thou tookst no care: Delay not time, thy glasse is run, Thy date is past, thy life is done. O stay a while, thou lovelye spright, Be not so hasty to convay My soule into eternal night, Where it shall ne'er behold bright day. O doe not frown, thy angry looke Hath all my soule with horror shooke. But, woe is me! all is in vaine, And bootlesse is my dismall crye; Time will not be recall'd againe, Nor thou surcease before I dye. O let me live, and make amends To some of thy most dearest friends. But seeing thou obdurate art, And wilt no pitye on me showe, Because from thee I did depart, And left unpaid what I did owe: I must content myself, to take What lott to me thou wilt partake. And thus, as one being in a trance, A multitude of uglye fiends About this woefull prince did dance; He had no helpe of any friends: His body then they tooke away, And no man knew his dying day. XXIII. THE WITCHES' SONG —From Ben Jonson's Masque of Queens, presented at Whitehall, Feb. 2, 1609. The editor thought it incumbent on him to insert some old pieces on the popular superstition concerning witches, hobgoblins, fairies, and ghosts. The last of these make their appearance in most of the tragical ballads; and in the following songs will be found some description of the former. It is true, this song of the Witches, falling from the learned pen of Ben Jonson, is rather an extract from the various incantations of classic antiquity, than a display of the opinions of our own vulgar. But let it be observed, that a parcel of learned wiseacres had just before busied themselves on this subject, with our British Solomon James I. at their head: and these had so ransacked all writers ancient and modern, and so blended and kneaded together the several superstitions of different times and nations, that those of genuine English growth could no longer be traced out and distinguished. By good luck the whimsical belief of fairies and goblins could furnish no pretences for torturing our fellow-creatures, and therefore we have this handed down to us pure and unsophisticated. 1 Witch. I have beene all day looking after A raven feeding upon a quarter; And, soone as she turn'd her beak to the south, I snatch'd this morsell out of her mouth. 2 Witch. I have beene gathering wolves haires, The mad dogges foame, and adders eares; The spurging of a deadmans eyes: And all since the evening starre did rise. 3 Witch. I last night lay all alone O' the ground, to heare the mandrake grone; And pluckt him up, though he grew full low: And, as I had done, the cocke did crow. 4 Witch. And I ha' beene chusing out this scull From charnell houses that were full; From private grots, and publike pits; And frighted a sexton out of his wits. 5 Witch. Under a cradle I did creepe By day; and, when the childe was a-sleepe At night, I suck'd the breath; and rose, And pluck'd the nodding nurse by the nose. 6 Witch. I had a dagger: what did I with that? Killed an infant to have his fat. A piper it got, at a church-ale, I bade him again blow wind i' the taile. 7 Witch. A murderer, yonder, was hung in chaines; The sunne and the wind had shrunke his veines: I bit off a sinew; I clipp'd his haire; I brought off his ragges, that danc'd i'the ayre. 8 Witch. The scrich-owles egges, and the feathers blacke, The bloud of the frogge, and the bone in his backe I have been getting; and made of his skin A purset, to keepe sir Cranion in. 9 Witch. And I ha' beene plucking (plants among) Hemlock, henbane, adders-tongue, Night-shade, moone-wort, libbards-bane; And twise by the dogges was like to be tane. 10 Witch. I from the jawes of a gardiner's bitch Did snatch these bones, and then leap'd the ditch: Yet went I back to the house againe, Kill'd the blacke cat, and here is the braine. 11 Witch. I went to the toad, breedes under the wall, I charmed him out, and he came at my call; I scratch'd out the eyes of the owle before; I tore the batts wing: what would you have more? Dame. Yes: I have brought, to helpe your vows, Horned poppie, cypresse boughes, The fig-tree wild, that growes on tombes, And juice, that from the larch-tree comes, The basiliskes bloud, and the vipers skin: And now our orgies let's begin. Since this ballad was printed off the Editor hath seen an ancient black-letter copy, containing some variations, and intitled, “The merry pranks of Robin Good-Fellow. To the tune of Dulcina, &amp;c.” See p. 151. To this copy were prefixed two wooden cuts of Robin Good-Fellow, which seem to represent the dresses in which this whimsical character was formerly exhibited on the stage. To gratify the curious these are engraven below. XXIV. ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW The attribution of this poem is questionable. —alias Pucke, alias Hobgoblin, in the creed of ancient superstition, was a kind of merry sprite, whose character and atchievements are recorded in this ballad, and in those well-known lines of Milton's L'Allegro, which the antiquarian Peck supposes to be owing to it; “Tells how the drudging Goblin swet “To earn his cream-bowle duly set; “When in one night, ere glimpse of morne, “His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn “That ten day-labourers could not end; “Then lies him down the lubbar fiend, “And stretch'd out all the chimneys length, “Basks at the fire his hairy strength, “And crop-full out of doors he flings, “Ere the first cock his matins rings.” The reader will observe that our simple ancestors had reduced all these whimsies to a kind of system, as regular, and perhaps more consistent, than many parts of classic mythology: a proof of the extensive influence and vast antiquity of these superstitions. Mankind, and especially the common people, could not every where have been so unanimously agreed concerning these arbitrary notions, if they had not prevailed among them for many ages. Indeed, a learned friend in Wales assures the editor, that the existence of Fairies and Goblins is alluded to by the most ancient British Bards, who mention them under various names, one of the most common of which signifies, “The spirits of the mountains.” See also Preface to Song XXV. This song (which Peck attributes to Ben Jonson, tho' it is not found among his works) is given from an ancient black letter copy in the British Museum. It seems to have been originally intended for some Masque. See the last page of this volume. From Oberon, in fairye land, The king of ghosts and shadowes there, Mad Robin I, at his command, Am sent to viewe the night-sports here. What revell rout Is kept about, In every corner where I go, I will o'ersee, And merry bee, And make good sport, with ho, ho, ho! More swift than lightening can I flye About this aery welkin soone, And, in a minutes space, descrye Each thing that's done belowe the moone. There's not a hag Or ghost shall wag, Or cry, ware Goblins! where I go; But Robin I Their feates will spy, And send them home, with ho, ho, ho! Whene'er such wanderers I meete, As from their night-sports they trudge home; With counterfeiting voice I greete And call them on, with me to roame Thro' woods, thro' lakes, Thro' bogs, thro' brakes; Or else, unseene, with them I go, All in the nicke To play some tricke And frolicke it, with ho, ho, ho! Sometimes I meete them like a man; Sometimes, an ox; sometimes, a hound; And to a horse I turn me can; To trip and trot about them round. But if, to ride, My backe they stride, More swift than wind away I go, Ore hedge and lands, Thro' pools and ponds, I whirry, laughing, ho, ho, ho! When lads and lasses merry be, With possets and with juncates fine; Unseene of all the company, I eat their cakes and sip their wine; And, to make sport, I fart and snort; And out the candles I do blow: The maids I kiss; They shrieke—Who's this? I answer nought, but ho, ho, ho! Yet now and then, the maids to please, At midnight I card up their wooll; And while they sleepe, and take their ease, With wheel to threads their flax I pull. I grind at mill Their malt up still; I dress their hemp, I spin their tow. If any 'wake, And would me take, I wend me, laughing, ho, ho, ho! When house or harth doth sluttish lye, I pinch the maidens blacke and blue; The bed-clothes from the bed pull I, And lay them naked all to view. 'Twixt sleepe and wake, I do them take, And on the key-cold floor them throw. If out they cry, Then forth I fly, And loudly laugh out, ho, ho, ho! When any need to borrowe ought, We lend them what they do require; And for the use demand we nought; Our owne is all we do desire. If to repay, They do delay, Abroad amongst them then I go, And night by night, I them affright With pinchings, dreames, and ho, ho, ho! When lazie queans have nought to do, But study how to cog and lye; To make debate and mischief too, 'Twixt one another secretlye: I marke their gloze, And it disclose, To them whom they have wronged so; When I have done, I get me gone, And leave them scolding, ho, ho, ho! When men do traps and engins set In loop-holes, where the vermine creepe, Who from their foldes and houses, get Their duckes and geese, and lambes and sheepe: I spy the gin, And enter in, And seeme a vermine taken so; But when they there Approach me neare, I leap out laughing, ho, ho, ho! By wells and rills, in meadowes greene, We nightly dance our hey-day guise; And to our fairye king, and queene, We chant our moon-light minstrelsies. When larks 'gin sing, Away we fling; And babes new-borne steal as we go, An elfe in bed We leave instead, And wend us laughing, ho, ho, ho! From hag-bred Merlins time have I Thus nightly revell'd to and fro; And for my pranks men call me by The name of Robin Good-fellòw. Fiends, ghosts, and sprites, Who haunt the nightes, The hags and goblins do me know; And beldames old My feates have told; So Vale, Vale; ho, ho, ho! XXV. THE FAIRY QUEEN. We have here a short display of the popular belief concerning Fairies. It will afford entertainment to a contemplative mind to trace these whimsical opinions up to their origin. Whoever considers, how early, how extensively, and how uniformly they have prevailed in these nations, will not readily assent to the hypothesis of those, who fetch them from the east so late as the time of the Croisades. Whereas it is well known that our Saxon ancestors long before they left their German forests, believed the existence of a kind of diminutive demons, or middle species between men and spirits, whom they called Duergar or Dwarfs, and to whom they attributed many wonderful performances, far exceeding human art. Vid. Hervarer Saga Olaj Verelj. 1675. Hickes Thesaur. &amp;c. This Song is given from an old black-letter copy. Come, follow, follow mee, Ye Fairy Elves that be Light tripping oer the green, Come follow Mab your queen; Hand in hand we'll dance around, Because this place is fairye ground. When mortals are at rest, And snoring in their nest; Unheard, and un-espy'd, Through key-holes we do glide; Over tables, stooles, and shelves, We trip it with our fairye elves. And, if the house be foull With platter, dish or bowl, Up staires we nimbly creep, And find the sluts asleep: Then we pinch their armes and thighes; None us heares, and none us spies. But if the house be swept, And from uncleanness kept, We praise the houshold maid, And duely she is paid: Every night before we goe, We drop a tester in her shoe. Then o'er a mushroomes head Our table-cloth we spread; A grain of rye, or wheat, The diet that we eat; Pearly drops of dew we drink In acorn cups fill'd to the brink. The braines of nightingales, With unctuous fat of snailes, Between two cockles stew'd, Is meat that's easily chew'd; Tailes of wormes, and marrow of mice Do make a dish, that's wonderous nice. The grashopper, gnat, and fly, Serve for our minstrelsy, Grace said, we dance a while, And so the time beguile: And if the moon doth hide her head, The glow-worm lightes us home to bed. O'er tops of dewy grasse So nimbly we do passe, The young and tender stalk Ne'er bends where we do walk: Yet in the morning may be seene Where we the night before have beene. XXVI. THE FAIRIES FAREWELL. This humorous old song fell from the hand of the facetious bishop Corbet (probably in his youth), and is printed from his Poëtica Stromata, 1648, 12 mo. (compared with the third edition of his poems, 1672.) It is there called, “A proper new Ballad, intituled, The Fairies Farewell, or God-a-mercy Will, to be sung or whistled to the tune of The Meddow brow, by the learned: by the unlearned, to the tune of Fortune.” The departure of Fairies is here attributed to the abolition of monkery: Chaucer has, with equal humour, assigned a cause the very reverse. “In the old dayes of king Artour “(Of which the Britons speken grete honour) “All was this lond fulfilled of fayry; “The elf-quene, with her jolly company, “Daunsed full oft in many a grene mede. “This was an old opinion as I rede: “I speke of many hundred yere agoe: “But now can no man see no elfes moe: “For now the grete charite, and prayeres “Of Limitours, and other holy freres, “That serchen every lond, and every streme, “As thick as motes in the sunne beme, “Blessing halles, chambers, kitchins, and bowres, “Cities, borowes, castelles, and hie toures, “Thropes, and bernes, shepens, and dairies; “This maketh that there ben now no fairies: “For there as wont to walken was an elfe, “There walketh now the Limitour himselfe, “In undermeles and in morrownynges, “And saieth his mattins and his holie thinges, “As he goeth in his limitacioune. “Wymen may now go safely up and doune, “In every bush, and under every tree, “There is none other incubus but he: “And he ne will don hem no dishonour.” Wife of Bath's Tale. Dr. Richard Corbet, having been bishop of Oxford about three years, and afterwards as long Bp. of Norwich, died in 1635, Ætat. 52. Farewell rewards and Fairies! Good housewives now may say; For now foule sluts in dairies, Doe fare as well as they: And though they sweepe their hearths no less Than mayds were wont to doe, Yet who of late for cleaneliness Finds sixe-pence in her shoe? Lament, lament old Abbies, The fairies lost command; They did but change priests babies, But some have chang'd your land: And all your children stoln from thence Are now growne Puritanes, Who live as changelings ever since, For love of your demaines. At morning and at evening both You merry were and glad, So little care of sleepe and sloth, These prettie ladies had. When Tom came home from labour, Or Ciss to milking rose, Then merrily went their tabour, And nimbly went their toes. Witness those rings and rounddelayes Of theirs, which yet remaine; Were footed in queene Maries dayes On many a grassy playne. But since of late Elizabeth And later James came in; They never danc'd on any heath, As when the time hath bin. By which wee note the fairies Were of the old profession: Their songs were Ave Maries, Their dances were procession. But now, alas! they all are dead, Or gone beyond the seas, Or farther for religion fled, Or else they take their ease. A tell-tale in their company They never could endure; And whoso kept not secretly Their mirth, was punish'd sure: It was a just and christian deed To pinch such blacke and blue: O how the common-welth doth need Such justices, as you! Now they have left our quarters; A Register they have, Who can preserve their charters; A man both wise and grave. An hundred of their merry pranks By one that I could name Are kept in store; con twenty thanks To William for the same. To William Churne of Staffordshire Give laud and praises due, Who every meale can mend your cheare With tales both old and true: To William all give audience, And pray yee for his noddle: For all the fairies evidence Were lost, if it were addle. After these Songs on the Fairies, the Reader may be curious to see the manner in which they were formerly invoked and bound to human service. In Ashmole's Collection of MSS. at Oxford, [Num. 8259. 1406. 2.] are the papers of some Alchymist, which contain a variety of Incantations and Forms of Conjuring both Fairies, Witches and Demons, principally, as it should seem, to assist him in his Great Work of transmuting Metals. Most of them are too impious to be reprinted: but the two following may be very innocently laughed at. Whoever looks into Ben Jonson's Alchymist, will find that these impostors, among their other Secrets, affected to have a power over Fairies. “An excellent way to gett a Fayrie. (For myself I call Margarett Barrance; but this will obteine any one that is not allready bownd.) “FIRST, gett a broad square christall or Venice glasse, in length and breadth 3 inches. Than lay that glasse or christall in the bloud of a white henne, 3 Wednesdayes, or 3 Fridayes. Then take it out, and wash it with holy aq. and fumigate it. Then take 3 hazle sticks, or wands of an yeare groth: pill them fayre and white; and make ‘them.’ soe longe, as you write the Spiritts name, or Fayries name, which you call, 3 times on every sticke being made flatt on one side. Then bury them under some hill, whereas you suppose Fayries haunt, the Wednesday before you call her: And the Friday followinge take them uppe, and call her at 8 or 3 or 10 of the clocke, which be good planetts and houres for that turne: but when you call, be in clean life, and turne thy face towards the east. And when you have her, bind her to that stone or glasse.” “An Unguent to annoynt under the Eyelids, and upon the Eyelids evninge and morninge: but especially when you call; or find your sight not perfect. “R. A pint of sallet-oyle, and put it into a viall glasse: but first wash it with rose-water, and marygold-water; the flowers ‘to’ be gathered towards the east. Wash it till the oyle come white; then put it into the glasse, ut supra: and then put thereto the budds of holyhocke, the flowers of marygold, the flowers or toppes of wild thime, the budds of young hazle: and the thime must be gathered neare the side of a hill where Fayries use to be: and ‘take’ the grasse of a fayrie throne, there. All these put into the oyle, into the glasse: and set it to dissolve 3 dayes in the sunne, and then keep it for thy use; ut supra.” After this follows a Form of Incantation, wherein the Alchymist conjures a Fairy, named Elaby Gathon, to appear to him in that Chrystal Glass, meekly and mildly; to resolve him truly in all manner of questions; and to be obedient to all his commands, under pain of Damnation, &amp;c. THE END OF BOOK THE SECOND. BOOK III. I. THE BIRTH OF ST. GEORGE. The incidents in this, and the other ballad of St. George and the Dragon, are chiefly taken from the old story-book of the Seven Champions of Christendome; which, tho' now the play-thing of children, was once in high repute. Bp. Hall in his satires, published in 1597, ranks “St. George's sorell, and his cross of blood” among the most popular stories of his time: and an ingenious critic thinks that Spencer himself did not disdain to borrow hints from it Mr. Warton. Vid. Observations on the Fairy Queen, 2 vol. 1762. 12 mo. passim.; tho' I much doubt whether this popular romance were written so early as the Faery Queen. The author of this book of the Seven Champions was one Richard Johnson, who lived in the reigns of Elizabeth and James, as we collect from his other publications: viz.—“The nine worthies of London: 1592. 4to.—“The pleasant walks of Moor-fields: 1607. 4to.—“A crown garland of Goulden Roses, gathered, &amp;c. 1612. 8vo.—“The life and death of Rob. Cecill, E. of Salisbury: 1612. 4to.—“The hist. of Tom of Lincoln, 4to.” is also by R. J. who likewise reprinted “Don Flores of Greece, 4to.” The Seven Champions, tho' written in a wild inflated style, contains some strong Gothic painting; which seems, for the most art, copied from the metrical romances of former ages. At least the story of St. George and the fair Sabra, is taken almost verbatim from the old poetical legend of “Syr Bevis of Hampton.” This very antique poem was in great fame in Chaucer's time, [see above pag. 100.] and so continued till the introduction of printing, when it ran thro' several editions; two of which are in black letter, 4to, “imprinted by Wyllyam “Copland” without date; containing great variations. As a specimen of the poetic powers of this very old rhimist, and as a proof how closely the author of the Seven Champions has followed him, take a description of the dragon slain by sir Bevis. “—Whan the dragon, that foule is, “Had a syght of syr Bevis, “He cast up a loude cry, “As it had thondred in the sky; “He turned his bely towarde the son; “It was greater than any tonne: “His scales was bryghter then the glas, “And harder they were than any bras: “Betwene his shulder and his tayle, “Was forty fote withoute fayle. “He waltred out of his denne, “And Bevis pricked his stede then, “And to hym a spere he thraste “That all to shyvers he it braste: “The dragon then gan Bevis assayle, “And smote syr Bevis with his tayle; “Then downe went horse and man, “And two rybbes of Bevis brused than. After a long fight, at length, as the dragon was preparing to fly, sir Bevis “Hit him under the wynge “As he was in his flyenge, “There he was tender without scale, “And Bevis thought to be his bale. “He smote after, as I you saye, “With his good sword Morglaye. “Up to the hiltes Morglay yode “Through harte, lyver, bone, and bloude: “To the ground fell the dragon, “Great joye syr Bevis begon. “Under the scales al on hight “He smote off his head forth right, “And put it on a spere: &amp;c. Sign. K. iv. Sir Bevis's dragon is evidently the parent of that in the Seven Champions, see Chap. III. viz. “The dragon no sooner had a sight of him [St. George] but he gave such a terrible peal, as though it had thundered in the elements. . . . . Betwixt his shoulders and his tail were fifty feet in distance, his scales glistering as bright as silver, but far more hard than brass; his belly of the colour of gold, but bigger than a tun. Thus weltered he from his den, &amp;c. . . . . The champion . . . gave the dragon such a thrust with his spear, that it shivered in a thousand pieces: whereat the furious dragon so fiercely smote him with his venomous tail, that down fell man and horse; in which fall two of St. Georges ribs were sore bruised, &amp;c.—At length . . . St. George smote the dragon under the wing where it was tender without scale, whereby his good sword Ascalon with an easie passage went to the very hilt through both the dragon's heart, liver, bone and blood—Then St. George—cut off the dragon's head and pitcht it upon the truncheon of a spear, &amp;c.” The History of the Seven Champions being written just before the decline of books of chivalry was never, I believe, translated into any foreign language: But “Le Roman de Beuves of Hantonne,” was published at Paris in 1502, 4to. Let. Gothique. The learned Selden tells us that about the time of the Norman invasion was Bevis famous with the title of Earl of Southampton, whose residence was at Dunction in Wiltshire; but observes that the monkish enlargements of his story, have made his very existence doubted. See Notes on Poly-Olbion, Song III. As for the martial History of St. George, it is given up as entirely apocryphal. The equestrian figure, worn by the knights of the garter, has been understood to be an emblem of the christian warrior, in his spiritual armour, vanquishing the old serpent. But a learned writer has lately shewn that it is neither more nor less, than a charm or amulet borrowed from some eastern heretics; which having been originally worn as a protection from the malignity of the air, at length was considered as a preservative from wounds, and a means to insure victory in battle. For it seems the ancient orientals represented the sun by a man on horseback; the sun's rays by a spear; and any noxious exhalation by a serpent. See Petingall's dissertation. 4to. It cannot be denied, but that a great part of the following ballad is modern: for which reason it would have been thrown to the end of the volume, had not its subject procured it a place here. Listen, lords, in bower and hall, I sing the wonderous birth Of brave St. George, whose valorous arm Rid monsters from the earth: Distressed ladies to relieve He travell'd many a day; In honour of the christian faith, Which shall endure for aye. In Coventry sometime did dwell A knight of worthy fame, High steward of this noble realme; Lord Albret was his name. He had to wife a princelye dame, Whose beauty did excell. This virtuous lady, being with child, In sudden sadness fell: For thirty nights no sooner sleepe Had clos'd her wakeful eyes, But, lo! a foul and fearful dreame Her fancy did surprize: She dreamt a dragon fierce and fell Conceiv'd within her womb; Whose mortal fangs her body rent Ere he to life could come. All woe-begone, and sad was she; She nourisht constant woe: Yet strove to hide it from her lord, Lest he should sorrow know. In vain she strove, her tender lord, Who watch'd her slightest look, Discover'd soon her secret paine, And soon that paine partook. And when to him the fearful cause She weeping did impart, With kindest speech he strove to heal The anguish of her heart. Be comforted, my lady deare, Those pearly drops refraine; Betide me weal, betide me woe, I'll try to ease thy paine. And for this foul and fearful dreame, That causeth all thy woe, Trust me I'll travel far away But I'll the meaning knowe. Then giving many a fond embrace, And shedding many a teare, To the weïrd lady of the woods He purpos'd to repaire. To the weïrd lady of the woods, Full long and many a daye, Thro' lonely shades, and thickets rough He winds his weary waye. At length he reach'd a dreary dell With dismal yews o'erhung; Where cypress spred it's mournful boughes, And pois'nous nightshade sprung. No chearful gleams here pierc'd the gloome, He hears no chearful sound; But shrill night-ravens yelling screame, And serpents hiss around. The shriek of fiends, and damned ghosts Ran howling thro' his eare: A chilling horror froze his heart, Tho' all unus'd to feare. Three times he strives to win his waye, And pierce those sickly dewes: Three times to bear his trembling corse His knocking knees refuse. At length upon his beating breast He signs the holy crosse; And, rouzing up his wonted might, He treads th'unhallow'd mosse. Beneath a pendent craggy cliffe, All vaulted like a grave, And opening in the solid rocke, He found the inchanted cave. An iron grate clos'd up the mouthe, All hideous and forlorne; And, fasten'd by a silver chaine, Near hung a brazen horne. Then offering up a ‘secret prayer,’ Three times he blowes amaine: Three times a deepe and hollow sound Did answer him againe. “Sir knight, thy lady beares a son, “Who, like a dragon bright, “Shall prove most dreadful to his foes, “And terrible in fight. “His name advanc'd in future times “On banners shall be worne: “But lo! thy lady's life must passe “Before he can be borne.” All sore opprest with feare and doubt Long time lord Albret stood; At length he winds his doubtful waye Back thro' the dreary wood. Eager to clasp his lovelye dame Then fast he travels backe: But when he reach'd his castle gate, His gate was hung with blacke. In every court and hall he found A sullen silence reigne; Save where, amid the lonely towers, He heard her maidens' plaine; And bitterly lament and weepe, With many a grievous grone: Then sore his bleeding heart misgave, His lady's life was gone. With faultering step he enters in, Yet half affraid to goe; With trembling voice asks why they grieve, Yet fears the cause to knowe. “Three times the sun hath rose and set; They said, then stopt to weepe: “Since heaven hath laid thy lady deare “In death's eternal sleepe. “For, ah! in travel sore she fell, “So sore that she must dye; “Unless some shrewd and cunning leech “Could ease her presentlye. “But when a cunning leech was fet, “Too soon declared hee, “She, or her babe must lose its life; “Both saved could not bee. “Now take my life, thy lady said, “My little infant save: “And O commend me to my lord, “When I am laid in grave. “O tell him how that precious babe “Cost him a tender wife: “And teach my son to lisp her name, “Who died to save his life. “Then calling still upon thy name, “And praying still for thee; “Without repining or complaint, “Her gentle soul did flee.” What tongue can paint lord Albret's woe, The bitter tears he shed, The bitter pangs that wrung his heart, To find his lady dead? He beat his breast: he tore his hair: And shedding many a teare, At length he askt to see his son; The son that cost so deare. New sorrowe seiz'd the damsells all: At length they faultering saye; “Alas! my lord, how shall we tell? “Thy son is stoln awaye. “Faire as the sweetest flower of spring, “Such was his infant mien: “And on his little body stampt “Three wonderous marks were seen: “A blood-red cross was on his arme; “A dragon on his breast: “A little garter all of gold “Was round his leg exprest. “Three carefull nurses we provide “Our little lord to keepe: “One gave him sucke, one gave him food, “And one did lull to sleepe. “But lo! all in the dead of night, “We heard a fearful sound: “Loud thunder clapt; the castle shook; “And lightning flasht around. “Dead with affright at first we lay; “But rousing up anon, “We ran to see our little lord: “Our little lord was gone! “But how or where we could not tell; “For lying on the ground, “In deep and magic slumbers laid, “The nurses there we found.” O grief on grief! lord Albret said: No more his tongue cou'd say, When falling in a deadly swoone, Long time he lifeless lay. At length restor'd to life and sense He nourisht endless woe, No future joy his heart could taste, No future comfort knowe. So withers on the mountain top A fair and stately oake, Whose vigorous arms are torne away, By some rude thunder-stroke. At length his castle irksome grew, He loathes his wonted home; His native country he forsakes In foreign lands to roame. There up and downe he wandered far, Clad in a palmer's gowne; Till his brown locks grew white as wool, His beard as thistle downe. At length, all wearied, down in death He laid his reverend head. Meantime amid the lonely wilds His little son was bred. There the weïrd lady of the woods Had borne him far away, And train'd him up in feates of armes, And every martial play. II. ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON. The following ballad is given (with some corrections) from two ancient black-letter copies in the Pepys Collection: one of which is in 12 mo, the other in folio. Of Hector's deeds did Homer sing; And of the sack of stately Troy, What griefs fair Helena did bring, Which was sir Paris' only joy: And by my pen I will recite St. George's deeds, an English knight. Against the Sarazens so rude Fought he full long and many a day; Where many gyants he subdu'd, In honour of the christian way: And after many adventures past To Egypt land he came at last. Now, as the story plain doth tell, Within that countrey there did rest A dreadful dragon fierce and fell, Whereby they were full sore opprest: Who by his poisonous breath each day, Did many of the city slay. The grief whereof did grow so great Throughout the limits of the land, That they their wise-men did intreat To shew their cunning out of hand; What way they might this fiend destroy, That did the countrey thus annoy. The wise-men all before the king This answer fram'd incontinent; The dragon none to death might bring By any means they could invent: His skin more hard than brass was found, That sword nor spear could pierce nor wound. When this the people understood, They cryed out most piteouslye, The dragon's breath infects their blood, That every day in heaps they dye: Among them such a plague it bred, The living scarce could bury the dead. No means there were, as they could hear, For to appease the dragon's rage, But to present some virgin clear, Whose blood his fury might asswage; Each day he would a maiden eat, For to allay his hunger great. This thing by art the wise-men found, Which truly must observed be; Wherefore throughout the city round A virgin pure of good degree Was by the kings commission still Taken up to serve the dragon's will. Thus did the dragon every day Untimely crop some virgin flowr, Till all the maids were worn away, And none were left him to devour: Saving the king's fair daughter bright, Her father's only heart's delight. Then came the officers to the king That heavy message to declare, Which did his heart with sorrow sting; She is, quoth he, my kingdom's heir: O let us all be poisoned here, Ere she should die, that is my dear. Then rose the people presently, And to the king in rage they went; They said his daughter deare should dye, The dragon's fury to prevent: Our daughters all are dead, quoth they, And have been made the dragons prey: And by their blood we rescued were, And thou hast sav'd thy life thereby; And now in sooth it is but faire, For us thy daughter so should die. O save my daughter, said the king; And let me feel the dragon's sting. Then fell fair Sabra on her knee, And to her father dear did say, O father, strive not thus for me, But let me be the dragon's prey; It may be, for my sake alone This plague upon the land was thrown. Tis better I should dye, she said, Than all your subjects perish quite; Perhaps the dragon here was laid, For my offence to work his spite: And after he hath suckt my gore, Your land shall feel the grief no more. What hast thou done, my daughter dear, For to deserve this heavy scourge? It is my fault, as may appear, Which makes the gods our state to purge; Then ought I die, to stint the strife, And to preserve thy happy life. Like mad-men, all the people cried, Thy death to us can do no good; Our safety only doth abide In making her the dragon's food. Lo! here I am, I come, quoth she, Therefore do what you will with me. Nay stay, dear daughter, quoth the queen, And as thou art a virgin bright, That hast for vertue famous been, So let me cloath thee all in white; And crown thy head with flowers sweet, An ornament for virgins meet. And when she was attired so, According to her mother's mind, Unto the stake then did she go; To which her tender limbs they bind: And being bound to stake a thrall She bade farewell unto them all. Farewell, my father dear, quoth she, And my sweet mother meek and mild; Take you no thought nor weep for me, For you may have another child: Since for my country's good I dye, Death I receive most willinglye. The king and queen and all their train With weeping eyes went then their way, And let their daughter there remain, To be the hungry dragon's prey: But as she did there weeping lye, Behold St. George came riding by. And seeing there a lady bright So rudely tyed unto a stake, As well became a valiant knight, He straight to her his way did take: Tell me, sweet maiden, then quoth he, What caitif thus abuseth thee? And, lo! by Christ his cross I vow, Which here is figured on my breast, I will revenge it on his brow, And break my lance upon his chest: And speaking thus whereas he stood, The dragon issued from the wood. The lady that did first espy The dreadful dragon coming so, Unto St. George aloud did cry, And willed him away to go; Here comes that cursed fiend, quoth she, That soon will make an end of me. St. George then looking round about, The fiery dragon soon espy'd, And like a knight of courage stout, Against him did most fiercely ride; And with such blows he did him greet, He fell beneath his horse's feet. For with his launce that was so strong, As he came gaping in his face, In at his mouth he thrust along, For he could pierce no other place: And thus within the lady's view This mighty dragon straight he slew. The savour of his poisoned breath Could do this holy knight no harm. Thus he the lady sav'd from death, And home he led her by the arm; Which when king Ptolemy did see, There was great mirth and melody. When as that valiant champion there Had slain the dragon in the field, To court he brought the lady fair Which to their hearts much joy did yield. He in the court of Egypt staid Till he most falsely was betray'd. That lady dearly lov'd the knight, He counted her his only joy; But when their love was brought to light It turn'd unto their great annoy: Th'Morocco king was in the court, Who to the orchard did resort: Dayly to take the pleasant air, For pleasure sake he us'd to walk, Under a wall he oft did hear St. George with lady Sabra talk: Their love he shew'd unto the king, Which to St. George great woe did bring. Those kings together did devise To make the christian knight away, With letters him in curteous wise They straightway sent to Persia: But wrote to th'sophy him to kill, And treacherously his blood to spill. Thus they for good did him reward With evil, and most subtilly By much vile meanes they had regard To work his death most cruelly; Who, as through Persia land he rode, With zeal destroy'd each idol god. For which offence he straight was thrown Into a dungeon dark and deep; Where, when he thought his wrongs upon, He bitterly did wail and weep: Yet like a knight of courage stout, At length his way he digged out. Three grooms of the king of Persia By night this valiant champion slew, Though he had fasted many a day; And then away from thence he flew On the best steed the sophy had; Which when he knew he was full mad. Towards Christendom he made his flight, But met a gyant by the way, With whom in combat he did fight Most valiantly a summer's day: Who yet, for all his bats of steel, Was forc'd the sting of death to feel. Back o'er the seas with many bands Of warlike souldiers soon he past, Vowing upon those heathen lands To work revenge; which at the last, Ere thrice three years were gone and spent, He wrought unto his heart's content. Save onely Egypt land he spar'd For Sabra bright her only sake, And, ere for her he had regard, He meant a tryal kind to make: Mean while the king o'ercome in field Unto saint George did quickly yield. Then straight Morocco's king he slew, And took fair Sabra to his wife, But meant to try if she were true Ere with her he would lead his life: And, tho' he had her in his train, She did a virgin pure remain. Toward England then that lovely dame The brave St. George conducted strait, An eunuch also with them came, Who did upon the lady wait; These three from Egypt went alone. Now mark St. George's valour shown. When as they in a forest were, The lady did desire to rest; Mean while St. George to kill a deer, For their repast did think it best: Leaving her with the eunuch there, Whilst he did go to kill the deer. But lo! all in his absence came Two hungry lyons fierce and fell, And tore the eunuch on the same In pieces small, the truth to tell; Down by the lady then they laid, Whereby they shew'd, she was a maid. But when he came from hunting back, And did behold this heavy chance, Then for his lovely virgin's sake His courage strait he did advance, And came into the lions sight, Who ran at him with all their might. Their rage did him no whit dismay, Who, like a stout and valiant knight, Did both the hungry lyons slay Within the lady Sabra's sight: Who all this while sad and demure, There stood most like a virgin pure. Now when St. George did surely know This lady was a virgin true, His heart was glad, that erst was woe, And all his love did soon renew: He set her on a palfrey steed, And towards England came with speed. Where being in short space arriv'd Unto his native dwelling place; Therein with his dear love he liv'd, And fortune did his nuptials grace: They many years of joy did see, And led their lives at Coventry. III. LOVE WILL FIND OUT THE WAY. This excellent song is ancient: but we could only give it from modern copies. Over the mountains, And over the waves; Under the fountains, And under the graves; Over floods that are deepest, Which Neptune obey; Over rocks that are steepest, Love will find out the way. Where there is no place For the glow-worm to lye; Where there is no space For receipt of a fly; Where the midge dares not venture, Lest herself fast she lay; If love come, he will enter, And soon find out his way. You may esteem him A child for his might; Or you may deem him A coward from his flight; But if she, whom love doth honour, Be conceal'd from the day, Set a thousand guards upon her, Love will find out the way. Some think to lose him, By having him confin'd; And some do suppose him, Poor thing, to be blind; But if ne'er so close ye wall him, Do the best that you may, Blind love, if so ye call him, Will find out his way. You may train the eagle To stoop to your fist; Or you may inveigle The phenix of the east; The lioness, ye may move her To give o'er her prey; But you'll ne'er stop a lover: He will find out his way. IV. LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET, A Scottish Ballad —seems to be composed (not without improvements) out of two ancient English ones, printed in the former part of this volume. See book I. ballad XV. and book II. ballad IV.—If this had been the original, the authors of these two ballads would hardly have adopted two such different stories: besides, this contains enlargements not to be found in either of the others. It is given with some corrections, from a MS. copy transmitted from Scotland. Lord Thomas and fair Annet Sate a' day on a hill; Whan night was cum, and sun was sett, They had not talkt their fill. Lord Thomas said a word in jest, Fair Annet took it ill: A'! I will nevir wed a wife Against my ain friends will. Gif ye wull nevir wed a wife, A wife wull neir wed yee. Sae he is hame to tell his mither, And knelt upon his knee: O rede, O rede, mither, he says, A gude rede gie to mee: O sall I tak the nut-browne bride, And let faire Annet bee? The nut-browne bride haes gowd and gear, Fair Annet she has gat nane; And the little beauty fair Annet haes, O it wull soon be gane! And he has till his brother gane: Now brother rede ye mee; A' fall I marrie the nut-browne bride, And let fair Annet bee? The nut-browne bride has oxen, brother, The nut-browne bride has kye; I wad hae ye marrie the nut-browne bride, And cast fair Annet bye. Her oxen may dye i' the house, Billìe, And her kye into the byre; And I sall hae nothing to my sell, Bot a fat fadge by the fyre. And he has till his sister gane: Now sister rede ye mee; O fall I marrie the nut-browne bride, And set fair Annet free? Ile rede ye tak fair Annet, Thomas, And let the browne bride alane; Lest ye sould sigh and say, Alace! What is this we brought hame? No, I will tak my mithers counsel, And marrie me owt o' hand; And I will tak the nut-browne bride; Fair Annet may leive the land. Up then rose fair Annets father Twa hours or it wer day, And he is gane into the bower, Wherein fair Annet lay. Rise up, rise up, fair Annet, he says, Put on your silken sheene; Let us gae to St. Maries kirke, And see that rich weddeen. My maides, gae to my dressing roome, And dress to me my hair; Whair-eir yee laid a plait before, See yee lay ten times mair. My maids, gae to my dressing room, And dress to me my smock; The one half is o' the holland fine, The other o' needle-work. The horse fair Annet rade upon, He amblit like the wind, Wi' siller he was shod before, Wi' burning gowd behind. Four and twanty siller bells Wer a' tyed till his mane, And yae tift o' the norland wind, They tinkled ane by ane. Four and twanty gay gude knichts Rade by fair Annets side, And four and twanty fair ladies, As gin she had bin a bride. And whan she cam to Maries kirk, She sat on Maries stean; The cleading that fair Annet had on It skinkled in their een. And whan she cam into the kirk, She shimmer'd like the sun; The belt that was about her waist, Was a' wi' pearles bedone. She sat her by the nut-browne bride, And her een they wer sae clear, Lord Thomas he clean forgat the bride, Whan fair Annet she drew. He had a rose into his hand, And he gae it kisses three, And reaching by the nut-browne bride, Laid it on fair Annets knee. Up than spak the nut-browne bride, She spak wi' meikle spite; And whair gat ye that rose-water, That does mak yee sae white? O I did get the rose-water, Whair ye wull neir get nane, For I did get that very rose-water Into my mithers wame. The bride she drew a long bodkìn, Frae out her gay head gear, And strake fair Annet unto the heart, That word she nevir spak mair. Lord Thomas he saw fair Annet wex pale, And marvelit what mote bee: But whan he saw her dear hearts blude, A' wood-wroth wexed hee. He drew his dagger, that was sae sharp, That was sae sharp and meet, And drave it into the nut-browne bride, That fell deid at his feit. Now stay for me, dear Annet, he sed, Now stay, my dear, he cry'd; Than strake the dagger untill his heart, And fell deid by her side. Lord Thomas was buried without kirk-wa', Fair Annet within the quiere; And o' the tane thair grew a birk, The other a bonny briere. And ay they grew, and ay they threw, As they was faine be neare; And by this ye may ken right weil, They were twa luvers deare. V. UNFADING BEAUTY. This little beautiful sonnet is reprinted from a small volume of “Poems by Thomas Carew, Esq; one of the gentlemen of the privie-chamber, and fewer in ordinary to his majesty (Charles I). Lond. 1640.” This elegant, and almost-forgotten writer, whose poems deserve to be revived, died in the prime of his age, in 1639. In the original follows a third stanza, which not being of general application, nor of equal merit, I have ventured to omit. Hee that loves a rosie cheeke, Or a corall lip admires, Or from star-like eyes doth seeke Fuell to maintaine his fires; As old time makes these decay, So his flames must waste away. But a smooth and stedfast mind, Gentle thoughts, and calme desires, Hearts with equal love combin'd Kindle never-dying fires: Where these are not I despise Lovely cheekes, or lips, or eyes. VI. GEORGE BARNWELL. The subject of this ballad is sufficiently popular from the modern play which is founded upon it. This was written by George Lillo a jeweller of London, and first acted about 1730.—As for the ballad, it was printed at least as early as the middle of the last century. It is here given from three old printed copies, which exhibit a strange intermixture of Roman and black letter. It is also collated with another copy in the Ashmole collection at Oxford, which is thus intitled, “An excellent ballad of George Barnwell, an apprentice of London, who . . . thrice robbed his master and murdered his vncle in Ludlow. The tune is “The Merchant.” This tragical narrative seems to relate a real fact; but when it happened I have not been able to discover. The First Part. All youths of fair Englànd That dwell both far and near, Regard my story that I tell, And to my song give ear. A London lad I was, A merchant's prentice bound; My name George Barnwell; that did spend My master many a pound. Take heed of harlots then, And their enticing trains; For by that means I have been brought To hang alive in chains. As I, upon a day, Was walking through the street About my master's business, A wanton I did meet. A gallant dainty dame, And sumptuous in attire; With smiling look she greeted me, And did my name require. Which when I had declar'd, She gave me then a kiss, And said, if I would come to her, I should have more than this. Fair mistress, then quoth I, If I the place may know, This evening I will be with you, For I abroad must go To gather monies in, That are my master's due: And ere that I do home return, I'll come and visit you. Good Barnwell, then quoth she, Do thou to Shoreditch come, And ask for Mrs. Millwood's house, Next door unto the Gun. And trust me on my truth, If thou keep touch with me, My dearest friend, as my own heart Thou shalt right welcome be. Thus parted we in peace, And home I passed right; Then went abroad, and gathered in, By six o'clock at night, An hundred pound and one: With bag under my arm I went to Mrs. Millwood's house, And thought on little harm; And knocking at the door, Straightway herself came down; Rustling in most brave attire, With hood and silken gown. Who, through her beauty bright, So gloriously did shine, That she amaz'd my dazzling eyes, She seemed so divine. She took me by the hand, And with a modest grace, Welcome, sweet Barnwell, then quoth she, Unto this homely place. And since I have thee found As good as thy word to be; A homely supper, ere we part, Thou shalt take here with me. O pardon me, quoth I, Fair mistress, I you pray; For why, out of my master's house, So long I dare not stay. Alas, good Sir, she said, Are you so strictly ty'd, You may not with your dearest friend One hour or two abide? Faith, then the case is hard, If it be so, quoth she; I would I were a prentice bound, To live along with thee: Therefore, my dearest George, List well what I shall say, And do not blame a woman much, Her fancy to bewray. Let not affection's force Be counted lewd desire, Nor think it not immodesty, I should thy love require. With that she turn'd aside, And with a blushing red, A mournful motion she bewray'd By hanging down her head. A handkerchief she had, All wrought with silk and gold: Which she to stay her trickling tears Before her eyes did hold. This thing unto my sight Was wondrous rare and strange; And in my soul and inward thought, It wrought a sudden change: That I so hardy grew, To take her by the hand: Saying, Sweet mistress, why do you So dull and pensive stand? Call me no mistress now, But Sarah, thy true friend, Thy servant, Millwood, honouring thee, Until her life hath end. If thou wouldst here alledge, Thou art in years a boy; So was Adonis, yet was he Fair Venus' only joy. Thus I, who ne'er before Of woman found such grace, But seeing now so fair a dame Give me a kind embrace, I supt with her that night, With joys that did abound; And for the same paid presently, In money twice three pound. An hundred kisses then, For my farewel she gave; Crying, Sweet Barnwell, when shall I Again thy company have? O stay not hence too long, Sweet George, have me in mind. Her words bewitcht my childishness, She uttered them so kind: So that I made a vow, Next Sunday without fail, With my sweet Sarah once again, To tell some pleasant tale. When she heard me say so, The tears fell from her eye; O George, quoth she, if thou dost fail, Thy Sarah sure will dye. Though long, yet loe! at last, The appointed day was come, That I must with my Sarah meet; Having a mighty sum Of money in my hand, Unto her house went I, Whereas my love upon her bed In saddest sort did lye. What ails my heart's delight, My Sarah dear? quoth I; Let not my love lament and grieve, Nor sighing pine, and die. But tell me, dearest friend, What may thy woes amend, And thou shalt lack no means of help, Though forty pound I spend. With that she turn'd her head, And sickly thus did say, Oh me, sweet George, my grief is great, Ten pound I have to pay Unto a cruel wretch; And God he knows, quoth she, I have it not. Tush, rise, I said, And take it here of me. Ten pounds, nor ten times ten, Shall make my love decay. Then from my bag into her lap, I cast ten pound straightway. All blithe and pleasant then, To banqueting we go; She proffered me to lye with her, And said it should be so. And after that same time, I gave her store of coyn, Yea, sometimes fifty pound at once; All which I did purloyn. And thus I did pass on; Until my master then Did call to have his reckoning in Cast up among his men. The which when as I heard, I knew not what to say: For well I knew that I was out Two hundred pound that day. Then from my master straight I ran in secret sort; And unto Sarah Millwood there My case I did report. But how she us'd this youth, In this his care and woe, And all a strumpet's wiley ways, The second part may showe. The Second Part. Young Barnwell comes to thee, Sweet Sarah, my delight; I am undone unless thou stand My faithful friend this night. Our master to accompts, Hath just occasion found; And I am caught behind the hand, Above two hundred pound: And now his wrath to 'scape, My love, I fly to thee, Hoping some time I may remaine In safety here with thee. With that she knit her brows, And looking all aquoy, Quoth she, What should I have to do With any prentice boy? And seeing you have purloyn'd Your master's goods away, The case is bad, and therefore here You shall no longer stay. Why, dear, thou knowst, I said, How all which I could get, I gave it, and did spend it all Upon thee every whit. Quoth she, Thou art a knave, To charge me in this sort, Being a woman of credit fair, And known of good report. Therefore I tell thee flat, Be packing with good speed, I do defie thee from my heart, And scorn thy filthy deed. Is this the friendship that You did to me protest? Is this the great affection which You so to me exprest? Now fie on subtle shrews! The best is, I may speed To get a lodging any where For money in my need. False woman, now farewell, Whilst twenty pound doth last, My anchor in some other haven With freedom I will cast. When she perceiv'd by this, I had store of money there: Stay, George, quoth she, thou art too quick: Why, man, I did but jeer: Dost think for all my speech, That I would let thee go? Faith no, said she, my love to thee I wiss is more than so. You scorne a prentice boy, I heard you just now swear, Wherefore I will not trouble you.— —Nay, George, hark in thine ear; Thou shalt not go to-night, What chance soe're befall: But man we'll have a bed for thee, Or else the devil take all. So I by wiles bewitcht, And snar'd with fancy still, Had then no power to ‘get’ away, Or to withstand her will. For wine on wine I call'd, And cheer upon good cheer; And nothing in the world I thought For Sarah's love too dear. Whilst in her company, I had such merriment; All, all too little I did think, That I upon her spent. A fig for care and thought! When all my gold is gone, In faith, my girl, we will have more, Whoever I light upon. My father's rich, why then Should I want store of gold? Nay with a father sure, quoth she, A son may well make bold. I've a sister richly wed, I'll rob her ere I'll want. Nay, then quoth Sarah, they may well Consider of your scant. Nay, I an uncle have, At Ludlow he doth dwell: He is a grazier, which in wealth Doth all the rest excell. Ere I will live in lack, And have no coyn for thee; I'll rob his house, and murder him. Why should you not? quoth she: Was I a man, ere I Would live in poor estate; On father, friends, and all my kin, I would my talons grate. For without money, George, A man is but a beast: But bringing money, thou shalt be Always my welcome guest. For shouldst thou be pursued With twenty hues and cryes, And with a warrant searched for With Argus' hundred eyes, Yet here thou shalt be safe; Such privy ways there be, That if they sought an hundred years, They could not find out thee. And so carousing both Their pleasures to content: George Barnwell had in little space His money wholly spent. Which done, to Ludlow straight He did provide to go, To rob his wealthy uncle there; His minion would it so. And once he thought to take His father by the way, But that he fear'd his master had Took order for his stay. Unto his uncle then He rode with might and main, Who with a welcome and good cheer Did Barnwell entertain. One fortnight's space he stayed, Until it chanced so, His uncle with his cattle did Unto a market go. His kinsman rode with him, Where he did see right plain, Great store of money he had took: When coming home again, Sudden within a wood, He struck his uncle down, And beat his brains out of his head; So sore he crackt his crown. Then seizing fourscore pound, To London straight he hyed, And unto Sarah Millwood all The cruell fact descryed. Tush, 'tis no matter, George, So we the money have To have good cheer in jolly sort, And deck us fine and brave. Thus lived in filthy sort, Until their store was gone: When means to get them any more, I wis, poor George had none. Therefore in railing sort, She thrust him out of door: Which is the just reward of those, Who spend upon a whore. O! do me not disgrace In this my need, quoth he. She call'd him thief and murderer, With all the spight might be: To the constable she sent, To have him apprehended; And shewed how far, in each degree, He had the laws offended. When Barnwell saw her drift, To sea he got straightway; Where fear and sting of conscience Continually on him lay. Unto the lord mayor then, He did a letter write; In which his own and Sarah's fault He did at large recite. Whereby she seized was, And then to Ludlow sent: Where she was judg'd, condemn'd, and hang'd, For murder incontinent. There dyed this gallant quean, Such was her greatest gains: For murder in Polonia, Was Barnwell hang'd in chains. Lo! here's the end of youth, That after harlots haunt; Who in the spoil of other men, About the streets do flaunt. VII. THE STEDFAST SHEPHERD. These beautiful Stanzas were written by George Wither, of whom some account was given in the former part of this Volume; see the song intitled, The Shepherds Resolution, p. 190. In our first Edition only a small Fragment of this Sonnet had been recovered, but we are now able to give it more perfect and intire by the insertion of five additional Stanzas: These are extracted from Wither's Pastoral Poem, The Mistress of Philarete; of which this Song makes a part. There were two or three other Stanzas, but as they appeared to be of inferior merit, were not adopted. Hence away, you Syrens, leave me, And unclaspe your wanton armes; Sugred words shall ne'er deceive me, (Though ‘you’ prove a thousand charmes). thou P. C. Fie, fie, forbeare; No common snare Could ever my affection chaine: Your painted baits, And poore deceits, Are all bestowed on me in vaine. I'me no slave to such, as you be; Neither shall a snowy brest, Wanton eye, or lip of ruby Ever robb me of my rest: Goe, goe, display Your beautie's ray To some ore-soone enamour'd swaine: Those common wiles Of sighs and smiles Are all bestowed on me in vaine. I have elsewhere vowed a dutie; Turne away ‘your’ tempting eyes: thy. P. C. Shew not me a naked beautie; Those impostures I despise: My spirit lothes Where gawdy clothes And fained othes may love obtaine: I love her so, Whose looke sweares No; That all your labours will be vaine. Can he prize the tainted posies, Which on every brest are worne; That may plucke the spotlesse roses From their never-touched thorne? I can goe rest On her sweet brest, That is the pride of Cynthia's traine: Then hold your tongues; Your mermaid songs Are all bestowed on me in vaine. Hee's a foole, that basely dallies, Where each peasant mates with him: Shall I haunt the thronged vallies, Whilst ther's noble hils to climbe? No, no, though clownes Are skar'd with frownes, I know the best can but disdaine; And those Ile prove: So shall your love Be all bestowed on me in vaine. I doe scorne to vow a dutie, Where each lustfull lad may wooe: Give me her, whose sun-like beautie Buzzards dare not soare unto: Shee, shee it is Affoords that blisse For which I would refuse no paine: But such as you, Fond fooles, adieu; You seeke to captive me in vaine. Leave me then, you Syrens, leave me; Seeke no more to worke my harmes: Craftie wiles cannot deceive me, Who am proofe against your charmes: You labour may To lead astray The heart, that constant shall remaine: And I the while Will sit and smile To see you spend your time in vaine. VIII. THE SPANISH VIRGIN, OR EFFECTS OF JEALOUSY. The subject of this ballad is taken from a folio collection of tragical stories, intitled “The theatre of God's judgments, by Dr. Beard and Dr. Taylor, 1642. Pt. 2. p. 89.—The text is given (with some corrections) from two copies; one of them in black letter in the Pepys collection. In this every stanza is accompanied with the following distich by way of burden, “Oh jealousie! thou art nurst in hell: “Depart from hence, and therein dwell.” All tender hearts, that ake to hear Of those that suffer wrong; All you, that never shed a tear, Give heed unto my song. Fair Isabella's tragedy My tale doth far exceed: Alas! that so much cruelty In female hearts should breed! In Spain a lady liv'd of late, Who was of high degree; Whose wayward temper did create Much woe and misery. Strange jealousies so fill'd her head With many a vain surmize, She thought her lord had wrong'd her bed, And did her love despise. A gentlewoman passing fair Did on this lady wait; With bravest dames she might compare; Her beauty was compleat. Her lady cast a jealous eye Upon this gentle maid; And taxt her with disloyaltye; And did her oft upbraid. In silence still this maiden meek Her bitter taunts would bear, While oft adown her lovely cheek Would steal the falling tear. In vain in humble sort she strove Her fury to disarm; As well the meekness of the dove The bloody hawke might charm. Her lord of humour light and gay, And innocent the while, As oft as she came in his way, Would on the damsell smile. And oft before his lady's face, As thinking her her friend, He would the maiden's modest grace And comeliness commend. All which incens'd his lady so She burnt with wrath extreame; At length the fire that long did glow, Burst forth into a flame. For on a day it so befell, When he was gone from home, The lady all with rage did swell, And to the damsell come. And charging her with great offence, And many a grievous fault; She bade her servants drag her thence, Into a dismal vault, That lay beneath the common-shore: A dungeon dark and deep: Where they were wont, in days of yore, Offenders great to keep. There never light of chearful day Dispers'd the hideous gloom; But dank and noisome vapours play Around the wretched room: And adders, snakes, and toads therein, As afterwards was known, Long in this loathsome vault had bin, And were to monsters grown. Into this foul and fearful place, The fair one innocent Was cast, before her lady's face; Her malice to content. This maid no sooner enter'd is, But strait, alas! she hears The toads to croak, and snakes to hiss: Then grievously she fears. Soon from their holes the vipers creep, And fiercely her assail: Which makes the damsel sorely weep, And her sad fate bewail. With her fair hands she strives in vain Her body to defend: With shrieks and cries she doth complain, But all is to no end. A servant listning near the door, Struck with her doleful noise, Strait ran his lady to implore; But she'll not hear his voice. With bleeding heart he goes agen To mark the maiden's groans; And plainly hears, within the den, How she herself bemoans. Again he to his lady hies With all the haste he may: She into furious passion flies, And orders him away. Still back again does he return To hear her tender cries; The virgin now had ceas'd to mourn; Which fill'd him with surprize. In grief, and horror, and affright, He listens at the walls; But finding all was silent quite, He to his lady calls. Too sure, O lady, now quoth he, Your cruelty hath sped: Make hast, for shame, and come and see; I fear the virgin's dead. She starts to hear her sudden fate, And does with torches run: But all her haste was now too late, For death his worst had done. The door being open'd strait they found The virgin stretch'd along: Two dreadful snakes had wrapt her round, Which her to death had stung. One round her legs, her thighs, her wast Had twin'd his fatal wreath: The other close her neck embrac'd, And stopt her gentle breath. The snakes, being from her body thrust, Their bellies were so fill'd, That with excess of blood they burst, Thus with their prey were kill'd. The wicked lady at this sight, With horror strait ran mad; So raving dy'd as was most right, Cause she no pity had. Let me advise you, ladies all, Of jealousy beware: It causeth many a one to fall, And is the devil's snare. IX. JEALOUSY TYRANT OF THE MIND. From a Manuscript copy communicated to the Editor. What state of life can be so blest, As love that warms the gentle brest? Two souls in one; the same desire To grant the bliss, and to require: If in this heaven a hell we find, Tis all from thee, O Jealousie! Thou tyrant, tyrant of the mind. All other ills, though sharpe they prove, Serve to refine and perfect love: In absence, or unkind disdaine, Sweet hope relieves the lovers paine: But, oh, no cure but death we find To sett us free From jealousie, Thou tyrant, tyrant of the mind. False in thy glass all objects are, Some sett too near, and some too farre: Thou art the fire of endless night, The fire that burns, and gives no light. All torments of the damn'd we find In only thee, O Jealousie; Thou tyrant, tyrant of the mind. X. CONSTANT PENELOPE. The ladies are indebted for the following notable documents to the Pepys collection, where the original is preserved in black-letter, and is intitled, “A looking-glass for ladies, or a mirrour for married women. Tune Queen Dido, or Troy town.” When Greeks, and Trojans fell at strife, And lords in armour bright were seen; When many a gallant lost his life About fair Hellen, beauties queen; Ulysses, general so free, Did leave his dear Penelope. When she this wofull news did hear, That he would to the warrs of Troy; For grief she shed full many a tear, At parting from her only joy; Her ladies all about her came, To comfort up this Grecian dame. Ulysses, with a heavy heart, Unto her then did mildly say, The time is come that we must part; My honour calls me hence away; Yet in my absence, dearest, be My constant wife, Penelope. Let me no longer live, she sayd, Then to my lord I true remain; My honour shall not be betray'd Until I see my love again; For I will ever constant prove, As is the loyal turtle-dove. Thus did they part with heavy chear, And to the ships his way he took; Her tender eyes dropt many a tear; Still casting many a longing look: She saw him on the surges glide, And unto Neptune thus she cry'd: Thou god, whose power is in the deep, And rulest in the ocean main, My loving lord in safety keep Till he return to me again: That I his person may behold, To me more precious far than gold. Then straight the ships with nimble sails Were all convey'd out of her sight: Her cruel fate she then bewails, Since she had lost her hearts delight: Now shall my practice be, quoth she, True vertue and humility. My patience I will put in ure, My charity I will extend; Since for my woe there is no cure, The helpless now I will befriend: The widow and the fatherless I will relieve, when in distress. Thus she continued year by year In doing good to every one; Her fame was noised every where, To young and old the same was known; No company that she would mind, Who were to vanity inclin'd. Mean while Ulysses fought for fame, 'Mongst Trojans hazarding his life: Young gallants, hearing of her name, Came flocking for to tempt his wife: For she was lovely, young, and fair, No lady might with her compare. With costly gifts and jewels fine, They did endeavour her to win; With banquets and the choicest wine, For to allure her unto sin: Most persons were of high degree, Who courted fair Penelope. With modesty and comely grace, Their wanton suits she did denye; No tempting charms could e'er deface Her dearest husband's memorye; But constant she would still remain, Hopeing to see him once again. Her book her dayly comfort was, And that she often did peruse; She seldom looked in her glass; Powder and paint she ne'er would use, I wish all ladies were as free From pride, as was Penelope. She in her needle took delight, And likewise in her spinning-wheel; Her maids about her every night Did use the distaff, and the reel: The spiders, that on rafters twine, Scarce spin a thread more soft and fine. Sometimes she would bewail the loss And absence of her dearest love: Sometimes she thought the seas to cross, Her fortune on the waves to prove: I fear my lord is slain, quoth she, He stays so from Penelope. At length the ten years siege of Troy Did end; in flames the city burn'd; And to the Grecians was great joy, To see the towers to ashes turn'd: Then came Ulysses home to see His constant, dear, Penelope. O blame her not if she was glad, When she her lord again had seen. Thrice-welcome home, my dear, she said, A long time absent thou hast been: The wars shall never more deprive Me of my lord whilst I'me alive. Fair ladies all example take; And hence a worthy lesson learn, All youthful follies to forsake, And vice from virtue to discern: And let all women strive to be, As constant as Penelope. XI. TO LUCASTA, ON GOING TO THE WARS. By Col. Richard Lovelace: from the volume of his poems intitled, “Lucasta, Lond. 1649.” 12mo. The elegance of this writer's manner would be more admired, if it had somewhat more of simplicity. Tell me not, sweet, I am unkinde, That from the nunnerie Of thy chaste breast and quiet minde, To warre and armes I flie. True; a new mistresse now I chase, The first foe in the field; And with a stronger faith imbrace A sword, a horse, a shield. Yet this inconstancy is such, As you too shall adore; I could not love thee, deare, so much, Lov'd I not honour more. XII. VALENTINE AND URSINE. It would be in vain to put off this ballad for ancient, nor yet is it altogether modern. The original is an old MS poem in the Editor's possession; which being in a wretched corrupt state, the subject was thought worthy of some embellishments. The old story-book of Valentine and Orson (which suggested the plan of this tale, but it is not strictly followed in it) was originally a translation from the French, being one of their earliest attempts at romance. See “Le Bibliotheque de Romans, &amp;c.” The circumstance of the bridge of bells is taken from the old metrical legend of Sir Bevis, and has also been copied in the Seven Champions. The original lines are, “Over the dyke a bridge there lay, “That man and beest might passe away: “Under the brydge were sixty belles; “Right as the Romans telles; “That there might no man passe in, “But all they rang with a gyn.” Sign. E. iv. Part the First. When Flora 'gins to decke the fields With colours fresh and fine, Then holy clerkes their mattins sing To good Saint Valentine! The king of France that morning fair He would a hunting ride: To Artois forest prancing forth In all his princely pride. To grace his sports a courtly train Of gallant peers attend; And with their loud and cheerful cryes The hills and valleys rend. Through the deep forest swift they pass, Through woods and thickets wild; When down within a lonely dell They found a new-born child: All in a scarlet kercher lay'd Of silk so fine and thin: A golden mantle wrapt him round Pinn'd with a silver pin. The sudden sight surpriz'd them all; The courtiers gather'd round; They look, they call, the mother seek; No mother could be found. At length the king himself drew near, And as he gazing stands, The pretty babe look'd up and smil'd, And stretch'd his little hands. Now, by the rood, king Pepin says, This child is passing fair: I wot he is of gentle blood; Perhaps some prince's heir. Goe bear him home unto my court With all the care ye may: Let him be christen'd Valentine, In honour of this day: And look me out some cunning nurse; Well nurtur'd let him bee; Nor ought be wanting that becomes A bairn of high degree. They look'd him out a cunning nurse; And nurtur'd well was hee; Nor ought was wanting that became A bairn of high degree. Thus grewe the little Valentine Belov'd of king and peers; And shew'd in all he spake or did A wit beyond his years. But chief in gallant feates of arms He did himself advance, That ere he grewe to man's estate He had no peere in France. And now the early downe began To shade his youthful chin; When Valentine was dubb'd a knight, That he might glory win. A boon, a boon, my gracious liege, I beg a boon of thee! The first adventure, that befalls, May be reserv'd for mee. The first adventure shall be thine; The king did smiling say. Nor many days, when lo! there came Three palmers clad in graye. Help, gracious lord, they weeping say'd; And knelt as it was meet: From Artoys forest we be come, With weak and wearye feet. Within those deep and drearye woods There wends a savage boy; Whose fierce and mortal rage doth yield Thy subjects dire annoy. 'Mong ruthless beares he sure was bred; He lurks within their den: With beares he lives; with beares he feeds, And drinks the blood of men. To more than savage strength he joins A more than human skill: For arms, ne cunning may suffice His cruel rage to still. Up then rose sir Valentine, And claim'd that arduous deed. Go forth and conquer, say'd the king, And great shall be thy meed. Well mounted on a milk-white steed, His armour white as snow; As well beseem'd a virgin knight, Who ne'er had fought a foe: To Artoys forest he repairs With all the haste he may; And soon he spies the savage youth A rending of his prey. His unkempt hair all matted hung His shaggy shoulders round: His eager eye all fiery glow'd: His face with fury frown'd. Like eagles' talons grew his nails: His limbs were thick and strong; And dreadful was the knotted oak He bare with him along. Soon as sir Valentine approach'd, He starts with sudden spring; And yelling forth a hideous howl, He made the forests ring. As when a tyger fierce and fell Hath spyed a passing roe, And leaps at once upon his throat; So sprung the savage foe; So lightly leap'd with furious force The gentle knight to seize: But met his tall uplifted spear, Which sunk him on his knees. A second stroke so stiff and stern Had laid the savage low; But springing up, he rais'd his club, And aim'd a dreadful blow. The watchful warrior bent his head, And shun'd the coming stroke; Upon his taper spear it fell, And all to shivers broke. Then lighting nimbly from his steed, He drew his burnisht brand: The savage quick as lightning flew To wrest it from his hand. Three times he grasp'd the silver hilt; Three times he felt the blade; Three times it fell with furious force; Three ghastly wounds it made. Now with redoubled rage he roar'd; His eye-ball flash'd with fire; Each hairy limb with fury shook; And all his heart was ire. Then closing fast with furious gripe He clasp'd the champion round, And with a strong and sudden twist He laid him on the ground. But soon the knight, with active spring, O'erturn'd his hairy foe: And now between their sturdy fists Past many a bruising blow. They roll'd and grappled on the ground, And there they struggled long: Skilful and active was the knight; The savage he was strong. But brutal force and savage strength To art and skill must yield: Sir Valentine at length prevail'd, And won the well-fought field. Then binding strait his conquer'd foe Fast with an iron chain, He tyes him to his horse's tail, And leads him o'er the plain. To court his hairy captive soon Sir Valentine doth bring; And kneeling downe upon his knee, Presents him to the king. With loss of blood and loss of strength, The savage tamer grew; And to sir Valentine became A servant try'd and true. And 'cause with beares he erst was bred, Ursine they call his name; A name which unto future times The Muses shall proclame. Part the Second. In high renown with prince and peere Now liv'd sir Valentine: His high renown with prince and peere Made envious hearts repine. It chanc'd the king upon a day Prepar'd a sumptuous feast; And there came lords, and dainty dames, And many a noble guest. Amid their cups, that freely flow'd, Their revelry, and mirth; A youthful knight tax'd Valentine Of base and doubtful birth. The foul reproach, so grossly urg'd, His generous heart did wound: And strait he vow'd he ne'er would rest Till he his parents found. Then bidding king and peers adieu, Early one summer's day, With faithful Ursine by his side, From court he takes his way. O'er hill and valley, moss and moor, For many a day they pass; At length upon a moated lake, They found a bridge of brass. Beyond it rose a castle fair Y-built of marble stone: The battlements were gilt with gold, And glittred in the sun. Beneath the bridge, with strange device, A hundred bells were hung; That man, nor beast, might pass thereon, But strait their larum rung. This quickly found the youthful pair, Who boldly crossing o'er, The jangling sound bedeast their ears, And rung from shore to shore. Quick at the sound the castle gates Unlock'd and opened wide, And strait a gyant huge and grim Stalk'd forth with stately stride. Now yield you, caytiffs, to my will; He cried with hideous roar; Or else the wolves shall eat your flesh, And ravens drink your gore. Vain boaster, said the youthful knight, I scorn thy threats and thee: I trust to force thy brazen gates, And set thy captives free. Then putting spurs unto his steed, He aim'd a dreadful thrust: The spear against the gyant glanc'd, And caus'd the blood to burst. Mad and outrageous with the pain, He whirl'd his mace of steel: The very wind of such a blow Had made the champion reel. It haply mist; and now the knight His glittering sword display'd, And riding round with whirlwind speed Oft made him feel the blade. As when a large and monstrous oak Unceasing axes hew: So fast around the gyant's limbs The blows quick-darting flew. As when the boughs with hideous fall Some hapless woodman crush: With such a force the enormous foe Did on the champion rush. A fearful blow, alas! there came, Both horse and knight it took, And laid them senseless in the dust; So fatal was the stroke. Then smiling forth a hideous grin, The gyant strides in haste, And, stooping, aims a second stroke: “Now caytiff breathe thy last!” But ere it fell, two thundering blows Upon his scull descend: From Ursine's knotty club they came, Who ran to save his friend. Down sunk the gyant gaping wide, And rolling his grim eyes: The hairy youth repeats his blows: He gasps, he groans, he dies. Quickly sir Valentine reviv'd With Ursine's timely care: And now to search the castle walls The venturous youths repair. The blood and bones of murder'd knights They found where'er they came: At length within a lonely cell They saw a mournful dame. Her gentle eyes were dim'd with tears; Her cheeks were pale with woe: And long sir Valentine besought Her doleful tale to know. “Alas! young knight,” she weeping said, “Condole my wretched fate: “A childless mother here you see; “A wife without a mate. “These twenty winters here forlorn “I've drawn my hated breath; “Sole witness of a monster's crimes, “And wishing aye for death. “Know, I am sister of a king; “And in my early years “Was married to a mighty prince, “The fairest of his peers. “With him I sweetly liv'd in love “A twelvemonth and a day: “When, lo! a foul and treacherous priest “Y-wrought our loves' decay. “His seeming goodness wan him pow'r; “He had his master's ear: “And long to me and all the world “He did a saint appear. “One day, when we were all alone, “He proffer'd odious love: “The wretch with horrour I repuls'd, “And from my presence drove. “He feign'd remorse, and piteous beg'd “His crime I'd not reveal: “Which, for his seeming penitence, “I promis'd to conceal. “With treason, villainy, and wrong “My goodness he repay'd: “With jealous doubts he fill'd my lord, “And me to woe betray'd. “He hid a slave within my bed, “Then rais'd a bitter cry: “My lord, possest with rage, condemn'd “Me, all unheard, to dye. “But 'cause I then was great with child, “At length my life he spar'd: “But bade me instant quit the realme, “One trusty knight my guard. “Forth on my journey I depart, “Opprest with grief and woe; “And tow'rds my brother's distant court, “With breaking heart, I goe. “Long time thro' sundry foreign lands “We slowly pace along: “At length within a forest wild “I fell in labour strong: “And while the knight for succour sought, “And left me there forlorn, “My childbed pains so fast increast “Two lovely boys were born. “The eldest fair, and smooth, as snow “That tips the mountain hoar: “The younger's little body rough “With hairs was cover'd o'er. “But here afresh begin my woes: “While tender care I took “To shield my eldest from the cold, “And wrap him in my cloak; “A prowling bear burst from the wood, “And seiz'd my younger son: “Affection lent my weakness wings, “And after them I run. “But all forewearied, weak and spent, “I quickly swoon'd away; “And there beneath the greenwood shade “Longtime I lifeless lay. “At length the knight brought me relief, “And rais'd me from the ground: “But neither of my pretty babes “Could ever more be found. “And, while in search we wander'd far, “We met that gyant grim; “Who ruthless slew my trusty knight, “And bare me off with him. “But charm'd by heav'n, or else my griefs, “He offer'd me no wrong; “Save that within these lonely walls “I've been immur'd so long.” Now, surely, said the youthful knight, Ye are lady Bellisance, Wife to the Grecian emperor: Your brother's king of France. For in your royal brother's court Myself my breeding had; Where oft the story of your woes Hath made my bosom sad. If so, know your accuser's dead, And dying own'd his crime; And long your lord hath sought you out Thro' every foreign clime. And when no tidings he could learn Of his much-wronged wife, He vow'd thenceforth within his court To lead a hermit's life. Now heaven is kind! the lady said; And dropt a joyful tear: Shall I once more behold my lord? That lord I love so dear? But, madam, said sir Valentine, And knelt upon his knee; Know you the cloak that wrapt your babe, If you the same should see? And pulling forth the cloth of gold, In which himself was found; The lady gave a sudden shriek, And fainted on the ground. But by his pious care reviv'd, His tale she heard anon; And soon by other tokens found, He was indeed her son. But who's this hairy youth? she said; He much resembles thee: The bear devour'd my younger son, Or sure that son were he. Madam, this youth with beares was bred, And rear'd within their den. But recollect ye any mark To know your son agen? Upon his little side, quoth she, Was stampt a bloody rose. Here, lady, see the crimson mark Upon his body grows! Then clasping both her new-found sons, She bath'd their cheeks with tears; And soon towards her brother's court Her joyful course she steers. What pen can paint king Pepin's joy, His sister thus restor'd! And soon a messenger was sent To chear her drooping lord: Who came in haste with all his peers, To fetch her home to Greece; Where many happy years they reign'd In perfect love and peace. To them sir Ursine did succeed, And long the scepter bare. Sir Valentine he stay'd in France, And was his uncle's heir. XIII. THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY. This humorous song (as a former Editor Collection of Historical Ballads in 3 vol. 1727. has well observed) is to old metrical romances and ballads of chivalry, what Don Quixote is to prose narratives of that kind:—a lively satire on their extravagant fictions. But altho' the satire is thus general; the subject of this ballad seems local and peculiar; so that many of the finest strokes of humour are lost for want of our knowing the particular facts to which they allude. These we have in vain endeavoured to recover; and are therefore obliged to acquiesce in the common account; namely, that this ballad alludes to a contest at law between an overgrown Yorkshire attorney and a neighbouring gentleman. The former, it seems, had stript three orphans of their inheritance, and by his incroachments and rapaciousness was become a nusance to the whole country; when the latter generously espoused the cause of the oppressed, and gained a complete victory over his antagonist, who with meer spite and vexation broke his heart. In handling this subject the Author has brought in most of the common incidents which occur in Romance. The description of the dragon See above pag. 100. &amp; p. 216.—his outrages—the people flying to the knight for succour—his care in chusing his armour—his being drest for fight by a young damsel—and most of the circumstances of the battle and victory (allowing for the burlesque turn given to them) are what occur in every book of chivalry whether in prose or verse. If any one piece, more than other, is more particularly levelled at, it seems to be the old rhiming legend of sir Bevis. There a Dragon is attacked from a Well in a manner not very remote from this of the ballad: There was a well, so have I wynne, And Bevis stumbled ryght therein. Than was he glad without fayle, And rested a whyle for his avayle; And dranke of that water his fyll; And than he lepte out, with good wyll, And with Morglay his brande, He assayled the dragon, I understande: On the dragon he smote so faste, Where that he hit the scales braste: The dragon then faynted sore, And cast a galon and more Out of his mouthe of venim strong, And on syr Bevis he it flong: It was venymous y-wis. This seems to be meant by the Dragon of Wantley's stink, ver. 110. As the politick knight's creeping out, and attacking the dragon, &amp;c. seems evidently to allude to the following, Bevis blessed himselfe, and forth yode, And lepte out with haste full good; And Bevis unto the dragon gone is; And the dragon also to Bevis. Longe, and harde was that fyght Betwene the dragon, and that knyght: But ever whan syr Bevis was hurt sore, He went to the well, and washed him thore; He was as hole as any man, Ever freshe as whan he began: The dragon sawe it might not avayle Besyde the well to hold batayle; He thought he would, wyth some wyle, Out of that place Bevis begyle; He woulde have flowen then awaye, But Bevis lepte after with good Morglaye, And hyt him under the wynge, As he was in his flyenge, &amp;c. Sign. M. jv. L. j. &amp;c. After all, perhaps the writer of this ballad was acquainted with the above incidents only thro' the medium of Spenser, who has assumed most of them in his Faery Queen. At least some particulars in the description of the Dragon, &amp;c. seem evidently borrowed from the latter, See Book 1. Canto 11. where the Dragon's “two wynges like sayls—huge long tayl—with stings—his cruel-rending clawes—and yron teeth—his breath of smothering smoke and sulphur”—and the duration of the fight for upwards of two days, bear a great resemblance to passages in the following ballad; though it must be confessed that these particulars are common to all old writers of Romance. The following ballad appears to have been written late in the last century; at least we have met with none but modern copies: the text is given from one in Roman letter in the Pepys collection, collated with two or three others. Old stories tell, how Hercules A dragon slew at Lerna, With seven heads, and fourteen eyes, To see and well discern-a: But he had a club, this dragon to drub, Or he had ne'er done it, I warrant ye: But More of More-Hall, with nothing at all, He slew the dragon of Wantley. This dragon had two furious wings, Each one upon each shoulder; With a sting in his tayl, as long as a flayl, Which made him bolder and bolder. He had long claws, and in his jaws Four and forty teeth of iron; With a hide as tough, as any buff, Which did him round environ. Have you not heard how the Trojan horse Held seventy men in his belly? This dragon was not quite so big, But very near, I'll tell ye. Devoured he poor children three, That could not with him grapple; And at one sup, he eat them up, As one would eat an apple. All sorts of cattle this dragon did eat. Some say he did eat up trees, And that the forests sure he would Devour up by degrees: For houses and churches, were to him geese and turkies; were to him gorse and birches. Other Copies. He eat all, and left none behind, But some stones, dear Jack, that he could not crack, Which on the hills you will find. In Yorkshire, near fair Rotherham, The place I know it well; Some two or three miles, or thereabouts, I vow I cannot tell; But there is a hedge, just on the hill edge, And Matthew's house hard by it; O there and then, was this dragon's den, You could not chuse but spy it. Some say, this dragon was a witch; Some say, he was a devil, For from his nose a smoke arose, And with it burning snivel; Which he cast off, when he did cough, In a well that he did stand by; Which made it look, just like a brook Running with burning brandy. Hard by a furious knight there dwelt, Of whom all towns did ring; For he could wrestle, play at quarter-staff, kick, cuff and huff, Call son of a whore, do any kind of thing: By the tail and the main, with his hands twain He swung a horse till he was dead; And that which is stranger, he for very anger Eat him all up but his head. These children, as I told, being eat; Men, women, girls and boys, Sighing and sobbing, came to his lodging, And made a hideous noise: O save us all, More of More-Hall, Thou peerless knight of these woods; Do but slay this dragon, who won't leave us a rag on, We'll give thee all our goods. Tut, tut, quoth he, no goods I want; But I want, I want in sooth, A fair maid of sixteen, that's brisk, ‘and keen,’ And smiles about the mouth; Hair black as sloe, skin white as snow, With blushes her cheeks adorning; To anoynt me o'er night, ere I go to fight, And to dress me in the morning. This being done he did engage To hew the dragon down; But first he went, new armour to Bespeak at Sheffield town; With spikes all about, not within but without, Of steel so sharp and strong; Both behind and before, arms, legs, and all o'er Some five or six inches long. Had you but seen him in this dress, How fierce he look'd and how big, You would have thought him for to be Some Egyptian porcupig: He frighted all, cats, dogs, and all, Each cow, each horse, and each hog: For fear they did flee, for they took him to be Some strange outlandish hedge-hog. To see this fight, all people then Got up on trees and houses, On churches some, and chimneys too; But these put on their trowses, Not to spoil their hose. As soon as he rose, To make him strong and mighty, He drank by the tale, six pots of ale, And a quart of aqua-vitæ. It is not strength that always wins, For wit doth strength excell; Which made our cunning champion Creep down into a well; Where he did think, this dragon would drink, And so he did in truth; And as he stoop'd low, he rose up and cry'd, boh! And hit him in the mouth. Oh, quoth the dragon, pox take thee, come out, Thou disturb'st me in my drink: And then he turn'd, and s??? at him; Good lack how he did stink! Beshrew thy soul, thy body's foul, Thy dung smells not like balsam; Thou son of a whore, thou stink'st so sore, Sure thy diet is unwholsome. Our politick knight, on the other side, Crept out upon the brink, And gave the dragon such a douse, He knew not what to think: By cock, quoth he, say you so: do you see? And then at him he let fly With hand and with foot, and so they went to't; And the word it was, hey boys, hey! Your words, quoth the dragon, I don't understand: Then to it they fell at all, Like two wild boars so fierce, if I may Compare great things with small. Two days and a night, with this dragon did fight Our champion on the ground; Tho' their strength it was great, their skill it was neat, They never had one wound. At length the hard earth began to quake, The dragon gave him a knock, Which made him to reel, and straitway he thought, To lift him as high as a rock, And thence let him fall. But More of More-Hall, Like a valiant son of Mars, As he came like a lout, so he turn'd him about, And hit him a kick on the a??? Oh, quoth the dragon, with a deep sigh, And turn'd six times together, Sobbing and tearing, cursing and swearing Out of his throat of leather; More of More-Hall! O thou rascàl! Would I had seen thee never; With the thing at thy foot, thou hast prick'd my a??? gut, And I'm quite undone for ever. Murder, murder, the dragon cry'd, Alack, alack, for grief; Had you but mist that place, you could Have done me no mischief. Then his head he shaked, trembled and quaked, And down he laid and cry'd; First on one knee, then on back tumbled he, So groan'd, kickt, s???, and dy'd. Since the first Edition was printed off, the Editor has been favoured with some curious particulars relating to the foregoing Song, which are here given in the words of the Relater. “In Yorkshire, six miles from Rotherham, is a village, called Wortley, the seat of the late Wortley Montague, Esq; About a mile from this village is a lodge, called Warncliff Lodge, but vulgarly called Wantley: here lies the scene of the Song. I was there above forty years ago; and it being a woody, rocky place, my friend made me clamber over rocks and stones, not telling me to what end, till I came to a sort of a cave; then asked my opinion of the place, and pointing to one end, says, Here lay the Dragon killed by Moor of Moor-hall: here lay his head; here lay his tail; and the stones we came over on the hill, are those he could not crack; and yon white house you see half a mile off, is Moor-hall. I had dined at the lodge, and knew the man's name was Matthew, who was a keeper to Mr. Wortley, and, as he endeavoured to persuade me, was the same Matthew mentioned in the Song: In the house is the picture of the Dragon and Moor of Moor-hall, and near it a Well, which, says he, is the Well described in the Ballad.” XIV. ST. GEORGE FOR ENGLAND. The First Part. As the former song is in ridicule of the extravagant incidents in old ballads and metrical romances; so this is a burlesque of their style; particularly of the rambling transitions and wild accumulation of unconnected parts, so frequent in many of them. This ballad is given from an old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection, “imprinted at London, 1612.” It is more ancient than many of the preceding; but we place it here for the sake of connecting it with the Second Part. Why doe you boast of Arthur and his knightes, Knowing ‘well’ how many men have endured fightes? For besides king Arthur, and Lancelot du lake, Or sir Tristram de Lionel, that fought for ladies sake; Read in old histories, and there you shall see How St. George, St. George the dragon made to flee. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Mark our father Abraham, when first he resckued Lot Onely with his household, what conquest there he got: David was elected a prophet and a king, He slew the great Goliah, with a stone within a sling: Yet these were not knightes of the table round; Nor St. George, St. George, who the dragon did confound. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Jephthah and Gideon did lead their men to fight, They conquered the Amorites, and put them all to flight: Hercules his labours ‘were’ on the plaines of Basse; And Sampson slew a thousand with the jawbone of an asse, And eke he threw a temple downe, and did a mighty spoyle: And St. George, St. George he did the dragon foyle. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The warres of ancient monarches it were too long to tell, And likewise of the Romans, how farre they did excell; Hannyball and Scipio in many a fielde did fighte: Orlando Furioso he was a worthy knighte: Remus and Romulus, were they that Rome did builde: But St. George, St. George the dragon made to yielde. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The noble Alphonso, that was the Spanish king, The order of the red scarffes and bandrolles in did bring This probably alludes to “An Ancient Order of Knighthood, called the Order of the Band, instituted by Don Alphonsus, king of Spain, . . to wear a red riband of three fingers breadth.” See Ames Typog. p. 327.: For he had a troope of mighty knightes, when first he did begin, Which sought adventures farre and neare, that conquest they might win: The rankes of the Pagans he often put to flight. But St. George, St. George did with the dragon fight. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Many ‘knights’ have fought with proud Tamberlaine. Cutlax the Dane, great warres he did maintaine: Rowland of Beame, and good ‘sir’ Olivere In the forest of Acon slew both woolfe and beare: Besides that noble Hollander, ‘sir’ Goward with the bill. But St. George, St. George the dragon's blood did spill. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Valentine and Orson were of king Pepin's blood: Alfride and Henry they were brave knightes and good: The four sons of Aymon, that follow'd Charlemaine: Sir Hughon of Burdeaux, and Godfrey of Bullaine: These were all French knightes that lived in that age. But St. George, St. George the dragon did assuage. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Bevis conquered Ascupart, and after slew the boare, And then he crost beyond the seas to combat with the Moore: Sir Isenbras, and Eglamore they were knightes most bold; And good Sir John Mandeville of travel much hath told: There were many English knights that Pagans did convert. But St. George, St. George pluckt out the dragon's heart. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The noble earl of Warwick, that was call'd sir Guy, The infidels and pagans stoutly did defie; He slew the giant Brandimore, and after was the death Of that most gastly dun cowe, the divell of Dunsmore heath: Besides his noble deeds all done beyond the seas. But St. George, St. George the dragon did appease. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Richard Coeur-de-lion erst king of this land, He the lion gored with his naked hand Alluding to the fabulous Exploits attributed to this King in the Old Romances. See the Dissertation prefixed to this Volume.: The false duke of Austria nothing did he feare; But his son he killed with a boxe on the eare: Besides his famous actes done in the holy lande. But St. George, St. George the dragon did withstande. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Henry the fifth he conquered all France, And quartered their arms, his honour to advance: He their cities razed, and threw their castles downe, And his head he honoured with a double crowne: He thumped the French-men, and after home he came. But St. George, St. George he did the dragon tame. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. St. David of Wales the Welsh-men much advance: St. Jaques of Spaine, that never yet broke lance: St. Patricke of Ireland, which was St. Georges boy, Seven yeares he kept his horse, and then stole him away: For which knavish act, as slaves they doe remaine. But St. George, St. George the dragon he hath slaine. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. XV. ST. GEORGE FOR ENGLAND, The Second Part. —was written by John Grubb, M. A. of Christ Church, Oxford. The occasion of its being composed is said to have been as follows. A set of gentlemen of the university had formed themselves into a Club, all the members of which were to be of the name of George: Their anniversary feast was to be held on St. George's day. Old Grubb of Christ Church solicited strongly to be admitted; but his name being unfortunately John, this disqualification was not without great difficulty dispensed with; and at last only upon this condition, that he would compose a song in honour of their Patron Saint, and would every year produce one or more new stanzas, to be sung on their annual festival. This gave birth to the following humorous performance, the several stanzas of which were the produce of many successive anniversaries. All that we can learn further concerning this facetious writer is contained in a few extracts from the university Register; by which it appears that he was matriculated in 1667, aged 20 years, being the son of John Grubb “de Acton Burnel in Comitatu Salop. pauperis.” He took his degree of Batchelor of Arts, June 7, 1671; and became Master of Arts, June 28, 1675. He was still living in Oxford, when the following humorous Distich was written, Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas, Bub, Stubb, Grubb, Crabb, Trapp, Young, Carey, Tickel, Evans. These were Bub Dodington (the late Lord Melcombe,) Dr. Stubbes, our Poet Grubb, Mr. Crabb, Dr. Trapp the Poetry Professor, Dr. Edw. Young the Poet, Walter Carey, Thomas Tickel, Esq; and Dr. Evans the Epigrammatist. I have since learnt that John Grubb was living in 1728, at which time he was aged 81. The Editor has never met with any two copies of the following ballad in which the stanzas were ranged alike, he has therefore thrown them into what seemed to him the most natural order. The verses were originally written in long lines as Alexandrines, but the narrowness of the page made it necessary to subdivide them. In this second Edition the Reader will find many improvements, which the Editor received from an ingenious friend. The story of king Arthur old Is very memorable. The number of his valiant knights, And roundness of his table: The knights around his table in A circle sate, d'ye see: And altogether made up one Large hoop of chivalry. He had a sword, both broad and sharp, Y-cleped Caliburn, Would cut a flint more easily, Than pen-knife cuts a corn; As case-knife does a capon carve, So would it carve a rock, And split a man at single slash, From noddle down to nock. As Roman Augur's steel of yore Dissected Tarquin's riddle, So this would cut both conjurer And whetstone thro' the middle. He was the cream of Brecknock, And flower of all the Welsh: But George he did the dragon fell, And gave him a plaguy squelsh, St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Pendragon, like his father Jove, Was fed with milk of goat; And in return a shield made of His shaggy nurse's coat: On top of burnisht helmet he Did wear a crest of leeks; And onions' heads, whose dreadful nod Drew tears down hostile cheeks. Itch, and Welsh blood did make him hot, And very prone to ire; H' was ting'd with brimstone, like a match, And would as soon take fire: As brimstone he took inwardly When scurf gave him occasion, His postern puff of wind was a Sulphureous exhalation. The Briton never tergivers'd, But was for adverse drubbing, And never turn'd his back for aught, But to a post for scrubbing. His sword would serve for battle, or For dinner, if you please; When it had slain a Cheshire man, 'Twould toast a Cheshire cheese. He wounded, and, in their own blood, Did anabaptize Pagans. But George he made the dragon an Example to all dragons. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Brave Warwick Guy, at dinner time, Challeng'd a gyant savage; And streight came out the unweildy lout Brim-full of wrath and cabbage: He had a phiz of latitude, And was full thick i'th' middle; The cheeks of puffed trumpeter, And paunch of squire Beadle Men of bulk answerable to their places, as is well known at Oxford.. But the knight fell'd him, like an oak, And did upon his back tread; The valiant knight his weazon cut, And Atropos his packthread. Besides he fought with a dun cow, As say the poets witty, A dreadful dun, and horned too, Like dun of Oxford city: The fervent dog-days made her mad, By causing heat of weather, Syrius and Procyon baited her, As bull-dogs did her father: Grasiers, nor butchers this fell beast, E'er of her frolick hindred; John Dorset A butcher at Oxford. she'd knock down as flat, As John knocks down her kindred: Her heels would lay ye all along, And kick into a swoon; Frewin's A cook, who on fast nights was famous for selling cow-heel and tripe. cow-heels keep up your corpse, But hers would beat you down. She vanquisht many a sturdy wight, And proud was of the honour; Was pufft by mauling butchers so, As if themselves had blown her. At once she kickt, and pusht at Guy, But all that would not fright him; Who wav'd his whinyard o'er sir-loyn, As if he'd gone to knight him: He let her blood, her frenzy to cure, And eke he did her gall rip; His trenchant blade, like cook's long spit, Ran thro' the monster's bald-rib: He rear'd up the vast crooked rib, Instead of arch triumphal. But George hit th'dragon such a pelt, As made him on his bum fall. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Tamerlain, with Tartarian bow, The Turkish squadrons slew; And fetch'd the pagan crescent down, With half-moon made of yew: His trusty bow proud Turks did gall, With showers of arrows thick, And bow-strings, without throtling, sent Grand-Visiers to old Nick: Much turbants, and much Pagan pates He made to humble in dust, And heads of Saracens he fixt On spears, as on a sign-post: He coop'd in cage grim Bajazet, Prop of Mahound's religion, As if he had been the whispering bird, That prompted him; the pigeon. In Turkey-leather scabbard, he Did sheath his blade so trenchant. But George he swing'd the dragon's tail, And cut off every inch on't. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The amazon Thalestris was Both beautiful, and bold; She sear'd her breasts with iron hot, And bang'd her foes with cold. Her hand was like the tool, wherewith Jove keeps proud mortals under; It shone just like his lightning, And batter'd like his thunder: Her eye darts lightning, that would blast The proudest he that swagger'd, And melt the rapier of his soul, In its corporeal scabbard. Her beauty, and her drum to foes Did cause amazement double; As timorous larks amazed are With light, and with a low-bell: With beauty, and that lapland-charm Her drum., Poor men she did bewitch-all; Still a blind whining lover had, As Pallas had her scrich-owl. She kept the chastness of a nun In armour, as in cloyster. But George undid the dragon just As you'd undo an oister. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Great Hercules, the offspring of Great Jove, and fair Alcmene: One part of him celestial was, The other part terrene. To scale the hero's cradle walls Two fiery snakes combin'd, And, curling into swadling cloaths, About the infant twin'd: But he put out these dragons' fires, And did their hissing stop; As red-hot iron with hissing noise Is quencht in blacksmith's shop. He cleans'd a stable, and rubb'd down The horses of new-comers; And out of horse-dung he rais'd fame, As Tom Wrench Who kept Paradise gardens at Oxford. does cucumbers. He made a river help him through; Alpheus was under groom; The stream, grumbling at office mean, Ran murmuring thro' the room: This liquid ostler to prevent Being tired with that long work, His father Neptune's trident took, Instead of three-tooth'd dung-fork. This Hercules, as soldier, and As spinster, could take pains; His club would sometimes spin ye flax, And sometimes knock out brains: H' was forc'd to spin his miss a shift, By Juno's wrath and hér-spite; Fair Omphale whipt him to his wheel, As cooks whip barking turn-spit. From man, or churn he well knew how To get him lasting fame: He'd pound a giant, till the blood, And milk till butter came. Often he fought with huge battoon, And oftentimes he boxed; Tapt a fresh monster once a month, As Hervey A noted Alehouse-keeper at Oxford. doth fresh hogshead. He gave Anteus such a hug, As wrestlers give in Cornwall. But George he did the dragon kill, As dead as any door-nail. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France. Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The Gemini, sprung from an egg, Were put into a cradle: Their brains with knocks and bottled ale, Were often-times full addle: And, scarcely hatch'd, these sons of him, That hurls the bolt trisulcate, With helmet-shell on tender head, Did bustle with red-ey'd pole-cat. Castor a horseman, Pollux tho' A boxer was, I wist: The one was fam'd for iron heel; Th'other for leaden fist. Pollux to shew he was a god, When he was in a passion, With fist made noses fall down flat, By way of adoration: This fist, as sure as French disease, Demolish'd noses' ridges: He like a certain lord Lord Lovelace broke down the bridges about Oxford, at the beginning of the Revolution. was fam'd For breaking down of bridges. Castor the flame of fiery steed, With well-spur'd boot took down; As men, with leathern buckets, do Quench fire in country town. His famous horse, that liv'd on oats, Is sung on oaten quill; By bards' immortal provender The nag surviveth still. This shelly brood on none but knaves Employ'd their brisk artillery: Flew naturally at rogues, as eggs At Dan De Foe in pillory. Much sweat they spent in furious fight, Much blood they did effund: Their whites they vented thro' the pore; Their yolks thro' gaping wound: Then both were cleans'd from blood and dust To make a heavenly sign; The lads were, like their armour, scowr'd, And then hung up to shine; Such were the heavenly double-Dicks, The sons of Jove and Tindar. But George he cut the dragon up, As 't had bin duck or windar. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France: Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Gorgon a twisted adder wore For knot upon her shoulder: She kemb'd her hissing periwig, And curling snakes did powder. These snakes they made stiff changelings Of all the folks they hist on; They turned barbers into hones, And masons into free-stone: Sworded magnetic Amazon Her shield to load-stone changes; Then amorous sword by magic belt Clung fast unto her haunches. This shield long village did protect, And kept the army from-town, And chang'd the bullies into rocks, That came t'invade Long-compton See the account of Rolricht Stones, in Dr. Plott's Hist. of Oxfordshire.. She post-diluvian stone unmans, And Pyrrha's work unravels; And stares Deucalion's hardy boys Into their primitive pebbles. Red noses she to rubies turns, And noddles into bricks. But George made dragon laxative; And gave him a bloody flix. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France: Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. By boar-spear Meleager Acquir'd a lasting name, And out of haunch of basted swine, He hew'd eternal fame. This beast each hero's trouzers ript, And rudely shew'd his bare-breech, Prickt but the wem, and out there came Heroic guts and garbadge. Legs were secur'd by iron bolts No more, than peas by peascods: Brass helmets, with inclosed sculls, Wou'd crackle in's mouth like chesnuts. His tawny hairs erected were By rage, that was resistless; And wrath, instead of cobler's wax, Did stiffen his rising bristles. His tusks lay'd dogs so dead asleep, Nor horn, nor whip cou'd wake 'um: It made them vent both their last blood, And their last album-grecum. But the knight gor'd him with his spear, To make of him a tame one, And arrows thick, instead of cloves, He stuck in monster's gammon. For monumental pillar, that His victory might be known, He rais'd up, in cylindric form, A coller of the brawn. He sent his shade to shades below, In Stygian mud to wallow: And eke the stout St. George eftsoon, He made the dragon follow. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France: Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Achilles of old Chiron learnt The great horse for to ride; H' was taught by th'Centaur's rational part, The hinnible to bestride. Bright silver feet, and shining face Had this stout hero's mother; As rapier's silver'd at one end, And wounds us at the other. Her feet were bright, his feet were swift, As hawk pursuing sparrow: Her's had the metal, his the speed Of Barfoot's A famous letter-carrier at Oxford: vid. his picture there. silver arrow. Thetis to double pedagogue Commits her dearest boy; Who bred him from a slender twig To be the scourge of Troy: But ere he lasht the Trojans, h' was In Stygian waters steept; As birch is soaked first in piss, When boys are to be whipt. With skin exceeding hard, he rose From lake, as black and muddy, As lobsters from the ocean rise, With shell about their body: And, as from lobster's broken claw, Pick out the fish you might: So might you from one unshell'd heel Dig pieces of the knight. His myrmidons robb'd Priam's barns And hen-roosts, says the song; Carried away both corn and eggs, Like ants from whence they sprung. Himself tore Hector's pantaloons, And sent him down bare-breech'd To pedant Radamanthus, in A posture to be switch'd. But George he made the dragon look, As if he had been bewitch'd. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France: Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. Full fatal to the Romans was The Carthaginian Hanni- bal; him I mean, who gave to them A devilish thump at Cannæ: Moors thick, as goats on Penmenmure, Stood on the Alpes's front: Their one-eyed guide Hannibal had but one eye., like blinking mole, Bor'd thro' the hindring mount: Who, baffled by the massy rock, Took vinegar for relief; Like plowmen, when they hew their way Thro' stubborn rump of beef. As dancing louts from humid toes Cast atoms of ill savour To blinking Hyatt A one-eyed fellow, who pretended to make fiddles as well as play on them; well-known in Oxford., when on vile crowd He merriment does endeavour, And saws from suffering timber out Some wretched tune to quiver: So Romans stunk and squeak'd at sight Of Affrican carnivor: The tawny surface of his phiz Did serve instead of vizzard: But George he made the dragon have A grumbling in his gizzard. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France: Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The valour of [illeg.]itian, It must not be forgotten; Who from the jaws of worm-blowing flies, Protected veal and mutton. A squadron of flies errant, Against the foe appears; With regiments of buzzing knights, And swarms of volunteers: The warlike wasp encourag'd 'em, With animating hum; And the loud brazen hornet next, He was their kettle-drum: The Spanish don Cantharido Did him most sorely pester, And rais'd on skin of vent'rous knight Full many a plaguy blister. A bee whipt thro' his button hole, As thro' key hole a witch, And stabb'd him with her little tuck Drawn out of scabbard breech: But the undaunted knight lifts up An arm so big and brawny, And slasht her so, that here lay head, And there lay bag and honey: Then 'mongst the rout he flew as swift, As weapon made by Cyclops, And bravely quell'd seditious buz, By dint of massy fly-flops. Surviving flies do curses breathe, And maggots too at Cæsar. But George he shav'd the dragon's beard, And Askelon The name of St. George's sword. was his razor. St. George he was for England; St. Dennis was for France: Sing, Honi soit qui mal y pense. XVI. LUCY AND COLIN —was written by Thomas Tickel, Esq; the celebrated friend of Mr. Addison, and editor of his works. He was son of a Clergyman in the north of England, had his education at Queen's college Oxon, was under-secretary to Mr. Addison and Mr. Craggs, when successively secretaries of state; and was lastly (in June, 1724) appointed secretary to the Lords Justices in Ireland, which place he held till his death in 1740. He acquired Mr. Addison's patronage by a poem in praise of the opera of Rosamond written while he was at the University. Of Leinster, fam'd for maidens fair, Bright Lucy was the grace; Nor e'er did Liffy's limpid stream Reflect so fair a face. Till luckless love, and pining care Impair'd her rosy hue, Her coral lip, and damask cheek, And eyes of glossy blue. Oh! have you seen a lily pale, When beating rains descend? So droop'd the slow-consuming maid; Her life now near its end. By Lucy warn'd, of flattering swains Take heed, ye easy fair: Of vengeance due to broken vows, Ye perjured swains, beware. Three times, all in the dead of night, A bell was heard to ring; And at her window, shrieking thrice, The raven flap'd his wing. Too well the love-lorn maiden knew The solemn boding sound; And thus, in dying words, bespoke The virgins weeping round. “I hear a voice, you cannot hear, “Which says, I must not stay: “I see a hand, you cannot see, “Which beckons me away. “By a false heart, and broken vows, “In early youth I die. “Am I to blame, because his bride “Is thrice as rich as I? “Ah Colin! give not her thy vows; “Vows due to me alone: “Nor thou, fond maid, receive his kiss, “Nor think him all thy own. “To-morrow in the church to wed, “Impatient, both prepare; “But know, fond maid, and know, false man, “That Lucy will be there. “Then, bear my corse; ye comrades, bear, “The bridegroom blithe to meet; “He in his wedding-trim so gay, “I in my winding-sheet.” She spoke, she dy'd;—her corse was borne, The bridegroom blithe to meet; He in his wedding-trim so gay, She in her winding-sheet. Then what were perjur'd Colin's thoughts? How were those nuptials kept? The bride-men flock'd round Lucy dead, And all the village wept. Confusion, shame, remorse, despair At once his bosom swell: The damps of death bedew'd his brow, He shook, he groan'd, he fell. From the vain bride (ah bride no more!) The varying crimson fled, When, stretch'd before her rival's corse, She saw her husband dead. Then to his Lucy's new-made grave, Convey'd by trembling swains, One mould with her, beneath one sod For ever now remains. Oft at their grave the constant hind And plighted maid are seen; With garlands gay, and true-love knots They deck the sacred green. But, swain forsworn, whoe'er thou art, This hallow'd spot forbear; Remember Colin's dreadful fate, And fear to meet him there. XVII. MARGARET's GHOST. This Ballad, which appeared in some of the public newspapers in or before the year 1724, came from the pen of David Mallet, Esq; who in the edition of his poems, 3 vols. 1759, informs us that the plan was suggested by the four verses quoted above in pag. 119, which he supposed to be the beginning of some ballad now lost. “These lines, says he, naked of ornament and simple, as they are, struck my fancy; and bringing fresh into my mind an unhappy adventure much talked of formerly, gave birth to the following poem, which was written many years ago.” The two introductory lines (and one or two others elsewhere) had originally more of the ballad simplicity, viz. “When all was wrapt in dark midnight, “And all were fast asleep, &amp;c. 'Twas at the silent solemn hour, When night and morning meet; In glided Margaret's grimly ghost, And stood at William's feet. Her face was like an April morn, Clad in a wintry cloud: And clay-cold was her lily hand, That held her sable shrowd. So shall the fairest face appear, When youth and years are flown: Such is the robe that kings must wear, When death has reft their crown. Her bloom was like the springing flower, That sips the silver dew; The rose was budded in her cheek, Just opening to the view. But love had, like the canker worm, Consum'd her early prime: The rose grew pale, and left her cheek; She dy'd before her time. “Awake! she cry'd, thy true love calls, “Come from her midnight grave; “Now let thy pity hear the maid, “Thy love refus'd to save. “This is the dumb and dreary hour, the mirk and fearful hour. 1st. Edit. “When injur'd ghosts complain; “Now yawning graves give up their dead, “To haunt the faithless swain. “Bethink thee, William, of thy fault, “Thy pledge, and broken oath: “And give me back my maiden vow, “And give me back my troth. “Why did you promise love to me, “And not that promise keep? “Why did you swear mine eyes were bright, “Yet leave those eyes to weep? “How could you say my face was fair, “And yet that face forsake? “How could you win my virgin heart, “Yet leave that heart to break? “Why did you say my lip was sweet, “And made the scarlet pale? “And why did I, young witless maid, “Believe the flattering tale? “That face, alas! no more is fair; “These lips no longer red: “Dark are my eyes, now clos'd in death, “And every charm is fled. “The hungry worm my sister is; “This winding-sheet I wear: “And cold and weary lasts our night, “Till that last morn appear. “But hark! the cock has warn'd me hence! “A long and last adieu! “Come see, false man, how low she lies, “Who dy'd for love of you.” The lark sung loud; the morning smil'd, Now birds did sing, and morning smile, And shew her glittering head. 1st Ed. With beams of rosy red: Pale William shook in ev'ry limb, And raving left his bed. He hyed him to the fatal place, Where Margaret's body lay; And stretch'd him on the grass-green turf, That wrapt her breathless clay: And thrice he call'd on Margaret's name, And thrice he wept full sore: Then laid his cheek to her cold grave, And word spake never more. XVIII. THE BOY AND THE MANTLE, As revised and altered by a modern hand. Mr. Warton, in his ingenious Observations on Spenser, has given his opinion that the fiction of the Boy and the Mantle is taken from an old French piece intitled Le court mantel quoted by M. de St. Palaye in his curious “Memoires sur l' ancienne Chevalerie,” Paris, 1759. 2 tom. 12mo. who tells us the story resembles that of Ariosto's inchanted cup. 'Tis possible our English poet may have taken the hint of this subject from that old French Romance, but he does not appear to have copied it in the manner of execution: to which (if one may judge from the specimen given in the Memoires) that of the ballad does not bear the least resemblance. After all 'tis most likely that all the old stories concerning K. Arthur are originally of British growth, and that what the French and other southern nations have of this kind were at first exported from this island. See Memoires de l' Acad. des Inscrip. tom. xx. p. 352. In Carleile dwelt king Arthur, A prince of passing might; And there maintain'd his table round, Beset with many a knight. And there he kept his Christmas With mirth and princely cheare, When, lo! a straunge and cunning boy Before him did appeare. A kirtle, and a mantle This boy had him upon, With brooches, rings, and owches Full daintily bedone. He had a sarke of silk About his middle meet; And thus, with seemely courtesy, He did king Arthur greet. “God speed thee, brave king Arthur, “Thus feasting in thy bowre. “And Guenever thy goodly queen, “That fair and peerlesse flowre. “Ye gallant lords, and lordings, “I wish you all take heed, “Lest, what ye deem a blooming rose “Should prove a cankred weed.” Then straitway from his bosome A little wand he drew; And with it eke a mantle Of wondrous shape, and hew. “Now have thou here, king Arthur, “Have thou here of mee, “And give unto thy comely queen, “All-shapen as you see. “No wife it shall become, “That once hath been to blame.” Then every knight in Arthur's court Slye glaunced at his dame. And first came lady Guenever, The mantle she must trye. This dame, she was new-fangled, And of a roving eye. When she had tane the mantle, And all was with it cladde, From top to toe it shiver'd down, As tho' with sheers beshradde. One while it was too long, Another while too short, And wrinkled on her shoulders In most unseemly sort. Now green, now red it seemed, Then all of sable hue. “Beshrew me, quoth king Arthur, “I think thou beest not true.” Down she threw the mantle, Ne longer would not stay; But storming like a fury, To her chamber flung away. She curst the whoreson weaver, That had the mantle wrought: And doubly curst the froward impe, Who thither had it brought. “I had rather live in desarts “Beneath the green-wood tree: “Than here, base king, among thy groomes, “The sport of them and thee.” Sir Kay call'd forth his lady, And bade her to come near: “Yet dame, if thou be guilty, “I pray thee now forbear.” This lady, pertly gigling, With forward step came on, And boldly to the little boy With fearless face is gone. When she had tane the mantle, With purpose for to wear: It shrunk up to her shoulder, And left her b??side bare. Then every merry knight, That was in Arthur's court, Gib'd, and laught, and flouted, To see that pleasant sport. Downe she threw the mantle, No longer bold or gay, But with a face all pale and wan, To her chamber slunk away. Then forth came an old knight, A pattering o'er his creed; And proffer'd to the little boy Five nobles to his meed: “And all the time of Christmass “Plumb-porridge shall be thine, “If thou wilt let my lady fair “Within the mantle shine.” A saint his lady seemed, With step demure, and slow, And gravely to the mantle With mincing pace does goe. When she the same had taken, That was so fine and thin, It shrivell'd all about her, And show'd her dainty skin. Ah! little did her mincing, Or his long prayers bestead; She had no more hung on her, Than a tassel and a thread. Down she threwe the mantle, With terror and dismay, And, with a face of scarlet, To her chamber hied away. Sir Cradock call'd his lady, And bade her to come neare: “Come win this mantle, lady, “And do me credit here. “Come win this mantle, lady, “For now it shall be thine, “If thou hast never done amiss, “Sith first I made thee mine.” The lady gently blushing, With modest grace came on, And now to trye the wondrous charm Courageously is gone. When she had tane the mantle, And put it on her backe, About the hem it seemed To wrinkle and to cracke. “Lye still, shee cryed, O mantle! “And shame me not for nought, “I'll freely own whate'er amiss, “Or blameful I have wrought. “Once I kist Sir Cradocke “Beneathe the green-wood tree: “Once I kist Sir Cradocke's mouth “Before he married mee.” When thus she had her shriven, And her worst fault had told, The mantle soon became her Right comely as it shold. Most rich and fair of colour, Like gold it glittering shone: And much the knights in Arthur's court Admir'd her every one. Then towards king Arthur's table The boy he turn'd his eye: Where stood a boar's-head garnished With bayes and rosemarye. When thrice he o'er the boar's head His little wand had drawne, Quoth he, “There's never a cuckold's knife, “Can carve this head of brawne.” Then some their whittles rubbed On whetstone, and on hone: Some threwe them under the table, And swore that they had none. Sir Cradock had a little knife Of steel and iron made; And in an instant thro' the skull He thrust the shining blade. He thrust the shining blade Full easily and fast: And every knight in Arthurs court A morsel had to taste. The boy brought forth a horne, All golden was the rim: Said he, “No cuckolde ever can “Set mouth unto the brim. “No cuckold can this little horne “Lift fairly to his head: “But or on this, or that side, “He shall the liquor shed.” Some shed it on their shoulder, Some shed it on their thigh; And hee that could not hit his mouth, Was sure to hit his eye. Thus he, that was a cuckold, Was known of every man: But Cradock lifted easily, And wan the golden can. Thus boar's head, horn and mantle Were this fair couple's meed: And all such constant lovers, God send them well to speed. Then down in rage came Guenever, And thus could spightful say, “Sir Cradock's wife most wrongfully “Hath borne the price away. “See yonder shameless woman, “That makes herselfe so clean: “Yet from her pillow taken “Thrice five gallants have been. “Priests, clarkes, and wedded men “Have her lewd pillow prest: “Yet she the wonderous prize forsooth “Must beare from all the rest.” Then bespake the little boy, Who had the same in hold: “Chastize thy wife, king Arthur, “Of speech she is too bold: “Of speech she is too bold, “Of carriage all too free; “Sir king, she hath within thy hall “A cuckold made of thee. “All frolick light and wanton “She hath her carriage borne: “And given thee for a kingly crown “To wear a cuckold's horne.” The learned editor of the Specimens of Welch Poetry, 4to. informs me that the story of the Boy and the Mantle is taken from what is related in some of the old Welsh MSS. of Tegan Earfron, one of King Arthur's mistresses. She is said to have possessed a mantle that would not fit any immodest or incontinent woman; this (which, the old writers say, was reckoned among the curiosities of Britain) is frequently alluded to by the old Welsh Bards. Carleile, so often mentioned in the Ballads of K. Arthur, the editor once thought might probably be a corruption of Caer-leon, an ancient British city on the river Uske in Monmouthshire, which was one of the places of K. Arthur's chief residence; but he is now convinced, that it is no other than Carlisle, in Cumberland; the Old English Minstrels, being most of them Northern Men, naturally represented the Hero of Romance as residing in the North: And many of the places mentioned in the Old Ballads are still to be found there: Thus Tearne-Wadling (vid. p. 12. note.) is the name of a Lake near Hesketh in Cumberland, on the road from Penrith to Carlisle. A Tradition still prevails in the neighbourhood, that an old Castle once stood at Tearne-Wadling, the remains of which are either now, or were not long since to be seen. THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.
