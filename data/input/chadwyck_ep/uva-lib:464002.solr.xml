Cros, and Curteis Crist þis begynnynge spede, For þe faderes frendchipe þat fourmede Heuene, And þoru? þe speciall spirit þat sprong of hem tweyne, And alle in on godhed endles dwelleþ! A and all myn A.b.c after haue y lerned, And [patred] in my pater-noster iche poynt after oþer, And after all, myn Aue-marie almost to þe ende; But all my kare is to comen for y can noh?t my Crede. Whan y schal schewen myn schrift schent mote y worþen, Þe prest wil me punyche &amp; penaunce enioyne; Þe Lengþe of a Lenten flech moot y leue After þat Estur ys ycomen and þat is hard fare; And Wedenes-day iche wyke wiþ-outen flech-mete. And also Jesu hym-self to the Jewes he seyde, “He þat leeueþ nou?t on me he leseþ þe blisse.” Þerfor lerne þe byleue leuest me were, And if any werldly wi?t wille me couþe, Oþer lewed or lered þat lyueþ þerafter, And fulliche folweth þe feyþ and feyneþ non oþer; Þat no worldliche wele wilneþ no tyme, But lyueþ in louynge of God and his lawe holdeþ, And for no getynge of good neuer his God greueþ, But follow[e]þ him þe full wey as he þe folke taughte. But to many maner of men þis matter is asked, Boþe to lered and to lewed þat seyn þat þey leueden Hollich on þe grete god and ho den alle his hestes; But by a fraynyng for-þan faileþ þer manye. For first y fraynede þe freres and þey me fulle tolden, Þat all þe frute of þe fayþ was in here foure ordres, And þe cofres of cristendam &amp; þe keye boþen, And þe lok [of beleve lyeth] loken in her hondes. Þanne [wende] y to wyten &amp; wiþ a whi?t y mette, A Menoure in a morow-tide &amp; to þis man I saide, “Sire, for grete god[e]s loue þe graiþ þou me tell, Of what myddelerde man my?te y best lerne My Crede? For I can it nou?t my kare is þe more; &amp; þerfore, for Cristes loue! þi councell y praie. A Carm me haþ y-couenaunt þe Crede me to teche; But for þou knowest Carmes well þi counsaile y aske.” þis Menour loked on me and law?yng he seyde, “Leue Cristen man y leue þat þou madde! Whou? schulde þei techen þe God þat con not hemselue? þei ben but jugulers and iapers, of kynde, Lorels and Lechures &amp; lemmans holden; Neyþer in order ne out but vn-neþe lybbeþ, And byiapeþ þe folke wiþ gestes of Rome! It is but a faynt folk i-founded vp-on iapes, Þei makeþ hem Maries men (so þei men tellen), And lieþ on our Ladie many a longe tale. And þat wicked folke wymmen bi-traieþ, And bigileþ hem of her good wiþ glauerynge wordes, And þerwiþ holden her hous in harlotes werkes. And, so saue me God! I hold it gret synne To ?yuen hem any good swiche glotones to fynde, To maynteyne swiche maner men þat mychel good destruyeþ. ?et seyn they in here sutilte to sottes in townes, Þei comen out of Carmeli Crist for to followen, &amp; feyneþ hem with holynes þat yuele hem bisemeþ. Þei lyuen more in lecherie and lieth in her tales Þan suen any god liife; but [lurken] in her selles, [And] wynnen werldliche god &amp; wasten it in synne. And ?if þei couþen her crede oþer on Crist leueden, Þei weren nou?t so hardie swich harlotri vsen. Sikerli y can nou?t fynden who hem first founded, But þe foles foundeden hem-self freres of the Pye, And maken hem mendynauns &amp; marre þe puple. But what glut of þo gomes may any good kachen, He will kepen it hym-self &amp; cofren it faste, And þei? his felawes fayle good for him he may steruen. Her money may bi-quest &amp; testament maken, And no obedience bere but don as [hem] luste. [And] ry?t as Robertes men raken aboute, At feires &amp; at ful ales &amp; fyllen þe cuppe, And precheþ all of pardon to plesen the puple. Her pacience is all pased &amp; put out to ferme, And pride is in her pouerte þat litell is to preisen. And at þe lulling of oure Ladye þe wymmen to lyken, And miracles of mydwyves &amp; maken wymmen to wenen Þat þe lace of oure ladie smok li?teþ hem of children. Þei ne prechen nou?t of Powel ne penaunce for synne, But all of mercy &amp; mensk þat Marie maie helpen. Wiþ sterne staues and stronge þey ouer lond strakeþ Þider as her lemmans liggeþ and lurkeþ in townes, (Grey grete-hedede quenes wiþ gold by þe ei?en), And seyn, þat here sustren þei ben þat soiourneþ aboute; And þus about þey gon &amp; godes folke by-traieþ. It is þe puple þat Powel preched of in his tyme; He seyde of swich folk þat so aboute wente, ‘Wepyng, y warne ?ow of walkers aboute; It beþ enemyes of þe cros þat crist opon þolede. Swiche slomerers in slepe slauþe is her ende, And glotony is her God wiþ g[l]oppyng of drynk, And gladnes in glees &amp; gret ioye y-maked; In þe schendyng of swiche schall mychel folk law?e.’ Þerfore, frend, for þi feyþ fond to don betere, Leue nou?t on þo losels but let hem forþ pasen, For þei ben fals in her feiþ &amp; fele mo oþere.” “Alas! frere,” quaþ I þo “my purpos is i-failed, Now is my counfort a-cast! canstou no bote, Where y my?te meten wiþ a man þat my?te me [wissen] For to conne my Crede Crist for to folwen?” “Certeyne, felawe,” quaþ þe frere “wiþ-outen any faile. Of all men opon mold we Menures most scheweþ Þe pure Apostell[e]s life wiþ penance on erþe, And suen hem in saunctite &amp; suffren well harde. We haunten none tauernes ne hobelen abouten; At marketts &amp; myracles we medleþ vs nevere; We hondlen no money but menelich faren, And haven hunger at [the] meate at ich a mel ones. We hauen forsaken the worlde &amp; in wo lybbeþ, In penaunce &amp; pouerte &amp; precheþ þe puple, By ensample of oure life soules to helpen; And in pouertie praien for all oure parteners Þat ?yueþ vs any good god to honouren, Oþer bell oþer booke or breed to our fode, Oþer catell oþer cloþ to coveren wiþ our bones, Money or money-worthe; here mede is in heven. For we buldeþ a burw? a brod and a large, A Chirche and A Chapaile with chambers a-lofte, Wiþ wide windowes y-wrou?t &amp; walles well heye, Þat mote bene portreid and paynt &amp; pulched ful clene, Wiþ gaie glittering glas glowing as þe sonne. And my?testou amenden vs wiþ money of þyn owne, Þou chuldest cnely bifore Crist in compas of gold In þe wide windowe westwarde wel ni?e in the myddell, And seynt Fraunces him-self schall folden the in his cope, And presente the to the trynitie and praie for thy synnes; Þi name schall noblich ben wryten &amp; wrou?t for the nones, And, in remembrance of þe y-rade þer for euer. And, broþer, be þou nou?t aferd; [bythenk in] thyn herte, Þou? þou conne nou?t þi Crede kare þou no more. I schal asoilen þe, syre &amp; setten it on my soule, And þou maie maken þis good þenk þou non oþer.” “Sire,” y saide, “in certaine y schal gon &amp; asaye;”— And he sette on me his honde &amp; asoilede me clene, And þeir y parted him fro wiþ-outen any peine, In couenant þat y come a?en Crist he me be-tau?te. Þanne saide y to my-self “here semeþ litel trewþe! First to blamen his broþer and bacbyten him foule, Þeire-as curteis Crist clereliche saide, ‘Whow my?t-tou in thine broþer ei?e a bare mote loken, And in þyn owen ei?e nou?t a bem toten? See fyrst on þi-self and siþen on anoþer, And clense clene þi sy?t and kepe well þyn ei?e, And for anoþer mannes ei?e ordeyne after.’ And also y sey coueitise catel to fongen, Þat Crist haþ clerliche forboden &amp; clenliche destruede, And saide to his sueres forsoþe on þis wise, ‘Nou?t þi nei?bours good couet yn no tyme.’ But charite &amp; chastete ben chased out clene, But Crist seide, ‘by her fruyt men shall hem ful knowen.’” Þanne saide y, “certeyn, sire þou demest full trewe!” Þanne þou?t y to frayne þe first of þis foure ordirs, And presede to þe prechoures to proven here wille. [Ich] hi?ede to her house to herken of more; And whan y cam to þat court y gaped aboute. Swich a bild bold, y-buld opon erþe hei?te Say i nou?t in certeine siþþe a longe tyme. Y ?emede vpon þat house &amp; ?erne þeron loked, Whou? þe pileres weren y-peynt and pulched ful clene, And queynteli i-coruen wiþ curiouse knottes, Wiþ wyndowes well y-wrou?t wide vp o-lofte. And þanne y entrid in and even-forþ went, And all was walled þat wone þou? it wid were, Wiþ posternes in pryuytie to pasen when hem liste; Orche?ardes and erberes euesed well clene, And a curious cros craftly entayled, Wiþ tabernacles y-ti?t to toten all abouten. Þe pris of a plou?-lond of penyes so rounde To aparaile þat pyler were pure lytel. Þanne y munte me forþ þe mynstre to knowen, And a-waytede a woon wonderlie well y-beld, Wiþ arches on eueriche half &amp; belliche y-corven, Wiþ crochetes on corners wiþ knottes of golde, Wyde wyndowes y-wrou?t y-written full þikke, Schynen wiþ schapen scheldes to schewen aboute, Wiþ merkes of marchauntes y-medled bytwene, Mo þan twenty and two twyes y-noumbred. Þer is none heraud þat haþ halt swich a rolle, Ri?t as a rageman haþ rekned hem newe. Tombes opon tabernacles tyld opon lofte, Housed in hirnes harde set abouten, Of armede alabaustre clad for þe nones, [Made vpon marbel in many maner wyse, Knyghtes in her conisantes clad for þe nones,] All it semed seyntes y-sacred opon erþe; And louely ladies y-wrou?t leyen by her sydes In many gay garmentes þat weren gold-beten. Þou? þe tax of ten ?er were trewly y-gadered, Nolde it nou?t maken þat hous half, as y trowe. Þanne kam I to þat cloister &amp; gaped abouten Whou? it was pilered and peynt &amp; portred well clene, All y-hyled wiþ leed lowe to þe stones, And y-paued wiþ peynt til iche poynte after oþer; Wiþ kundites of clene tyn closed all aboute, Wiþ lauoures of latun louelyche y-greithed. I trowe þe gaynage of þe ground in a gret schire Nolde aparaile þat place oo poynt til other ende. Þanne was þe chaptire-hous wrou?t as a greet chirche, Coruen and couered and queyntliche entayled; Wiþ semlich selure y-set on lofte; As a Parlement-hous y-peynted aboute. Þanne ferd y into fraytour and fond þere an oþer, An halle for an hey? kinge an housholde to holden, Wiþ brode bordes aboute y-benched wel clene, Wiþ windowes of glas wrou?t as a Chirche. Þanne walkede y ferrer &amp; went all abouten, And sei? halles full hy?e &amp; houses full noble, Chambers wiþ chymneyes &amp; Chapells gaie; And kychens for an hy?e kinge in castells to holden, And her dortour y-di?te wiþ dores ful stronge; Fermery and fraitur with fele mo houses, And all strong ston wall sterne opon heiþe, Wiþ gaie garites &amp; grete &amp; iche hole y-glased; [And oþere] houses y-nowe to herberwe þe queene. And ?et þise bilderes wilne beggen a bagg-ful of wheate Of a pure pore man þat maie oneþe paie Half his rente in a ?er and half ben behynde! Þanne turned y a?en whan y hadde all y-toted, And fond in a freitour a frere on a benche, A greet cherl &amp; a grym growen as a tonne, Wiþ a face as fat as a full bledder, Blowen bretfull of breþ &amp; as a bagge honged On boþen his chekes, &amp; his chyn wiþ a chol lollede, As greet as a gos eye growen all of grece; Þat all wagged his fleche as a quyk myre. His cope þat biclypped him wel clene was it folden, Of double worstede y-dy?t doun to þe hele; His kyrtel of clene whijt clenlyche y-sewed; Hyt was good y-now of ground greyn for to beren. I haylsede þat herdeman &amp; hendliche y saide, “Gode syre, for Godes loue canstou me graiþ tellen To any worþely wij?t þat [wissen] me couþe Whou y schulde conne my Crede Crist for to folowe, Þat leuede lelliche him-self &amp; lyuede þerafter, Þat feynede non falshede but fully Crist suwede? For sich a certeyn man syker wold y trosten, Þat he wolde telle me þe trewþe and turne to none oþer. And an Austyn þis ender daie egged me faste; þat he wolde techen me wel he ply?t me his treuþe, And seyde me, ‘serteyne syþen Crist died Oure ordir was [euelles] &amp; erst y-founde.’” “Fyrst, felawe!” quaþ he “fy on his pilche! He is but abortijf eked wiþ cloutes! He holdeþ his ordynaunce wiþe hores and þeues, And purchaseþ hem pryuileges wiþ penyes so rounde; It is a pur pardoners craft proue &amp; asaye! For haue þei þi money a moneþ þerafter, Certes, þei? þou come a?en he nyl þe nou?t knowen. But, felawe, our foundement was first of þe oþere, And we ben founded fulliche wiþ-outen fayntise; And we ben clerkes y-cnowen cunnynge in scole, Proued in procession by processe of lawe. Of oure ordre þer beþ bichopes wel manye, Seyntes on sundry stedes þat suffreden harde; And we ben proued þe prijs of popes at Rome, And of gretest degre as godspelles telleþ.” “A! syre,” quaþ y þanne “þou seyst a gret wonder, Siþen Crist seyd hym-self to all his disciples, ‘Which of ?ou þat is most most schal he werche, And who is goer byforne first schal he seruen.’ And seyde, ‘he sawe satan sytten full hey?e And ful lowe ben y-leyd;’ in lyknes he tolde, Þat in pouernesse of spyrit is spedfullest hele, And hertes of heynesse harmeþ þe soule. And þerfore, frere, fare well here fynde y but pride; Y preise nou?t þi preching but as a pure myte.” And anger[l]ich y wandrede þe Austyns to proue, And mette wiþ a maister of þo men &amp; meklich y seyde, “Maister, for þe moder loue þat Marie men kalleþ, Knowest þou ou?t, þer þou comest a creatour on erþe, Þat coude me my Crede teche and trewliche enfourme, Wiþ-outen flaterynge fare &amp; noþing feyne? Þat folweþ fulliche þe feiþ and none other fables, Wiþ-outen gabbynge of glose as þe godspelles telleþ? A Menour haþ me holly by-hy?t to helen my soule, For he seiþ þat her sekte is sykerest on erþe, And ben kepers of þe keye þat Cristendome helpeþ, And pur[l]iche in pouerte þe apostells þey suweþ.” “Alas!” quaþ þe frier “almost y madde in mynde, To sen hou? þis Minoures many men begyleth! Soþli, somme of þo gomes haþ more good him-selue Þan ten kny?tes þat y knowe of catell in cofers! In fraytour þei faren best of all þe foure orders, And [vsen] ypocricie in all þat þey werchen, And prechen all of parfitnes but loke now, y þe praye, Nou?t but profre hem in pryvite a [peny] for a masse, And, but his cnaue be prest put out myne ei?e, þou? he hadde more money hid þan marchantes of wolle! Loke hou? þis loresmen lordes bytrayen, Seyn þat þey folwen fully Fraunceses rewle, Þat in cotynge of his cope is more cloþ y-folden Þan was in Fraunces froc whan he hem first made. And ?et, vnder þat cope a cote haþ he furred, Wiþ foyns, or wiþ fitchewes oþer fyn beuer, And þat is cutted to þe kne &amp; queyntly y-botend, Lest any spirituall man aspie þat gile. Fraunces bad his breþeren barfote to wenden; Nou han þei bucled schon for bleynynge of her heles, And hosen in harde weder y-hamled by þe ancle, And spicerie sprad in her purse to parten where hem lust. Lordes loueth hem well for þei so lowe crouchen; But knewen men her cautel &amp; her queynt wordes, Þei wolde worchypen hem nou?t but a litel, Þe image of ypocricie ymped vpon fendes. But, sone, ?if þou wilte ben syker seche þou no ferther, We friers be þe first and founded vpon treuþe. Paul primus [heremita] put vs him-selue Awey into wildernes þe werlde to dispisen; And þere we leng[e]den full longe &amp; lyueden full harde, For-to all þis freren folke weren founded in townes, And tau?ten vntrulie; and þat we well aspiede, And for chefe charitie we chargeden vs seluen; In amending of þis men we maden oure celles To ben in cyties y-set to sty?tle þe people, Preching &amp; praying as profetes schulden; And so we holden vs þe heued of all holy chirche. We haue power of the pope purliche assoilen All þat helpen our hous in helpe of her soules, To dispensen hem wiþ in dedes of synne; All þat amendeth oure hous in money oþer elles, Wiþ corne oþer catell or cloþes of beddes, Oþer bedys or broche or breed for our fode. And ?if þou hast any good &amp; wilt þi-selfe helpen, Helpe vs hertliche þerwiþe &amp; here I vndertake, Þou schalt ben broþer of our hous &amp; a boke habben (At þe next chaptire) clereliche ensealed; And þanne oure prouinciall haþ power to assoilen Alle sustren &amp; breþeren þat beþ of our order. And þou? þou conne nou?t þi Crede knele downe here; My soule y sette for þyn to asoile þe clene, In Couenaunt þat þou come againe &amp; katell vs bringe.” And þanne loutede y adoun &amp; he me leue grauntede, And so I partid him fro &amp; þe frere left. Þanne seid I to my-self “here is no bote; Heere pride is þe pater-noster in preyinge of synne; Here Crede is coueytise; now can y no ferþer, ?et will y fonden forþ &amp; fraynen þe Karmes.” Þanne totede y into a tauerne &amp; þer y aspyede Two frere Karmes wiþ a full coppe. Þere y auntrede me in &amp; ai[s]liche y seide, “Leue syre, for þe lordes loue þat þou on leuest, Lere me to som man my Crede for to lerne, Þat lyueþ in [lel] lijf and loueþ no synne, And gloseþ nou?t þe godspell but half Godes he[s]tes, And neþer money ne mede ne may him nou?t letten But werchen after Godes worde wiþ-outen any faile. A prechour y-professed haþ pli?t me his trewþe To techen me trewlie; but woldest þou me tellen, For þei ben certayne men &amp; syker on to trosten, Y wolde quyten þe þi mede as my mi?te were.” “A trefle, quaþ he, “trewlie! his treuþ is full litell! He dyned nou?t wiþ Domynike siþe Crist deide! For wiþ þe princes of pride þe prechours dwellen; Þei bene as digne as þe devel þat droppeþ fro heuene. Wiþ hertes of heynesse wou? halwen þei chirches And deleþ in devynitie as dogges doþ bones! Þei medleth wiþ messages &amp; mariages of grete; Þey leeuen wiþ lordes wiþ lesynges y-nowe; Þey biggeþ hem bichopryches wiþ bagges of golde; þei wilneþ worchipes— but waite on her dedes! Herken at Herdforþe hou þat þey werchen, And loke whou þat þei lyven &amp; leeue as þou fyndest. Þey [ben] counseilours of kinges Crist wot þe soþe, Whou þey [curry] kinges &amp; her back claweþ!

Leeue it well, lef man &amp; men ry?t-lokede, Þer is more pryue pride in prechours hertes Þan þer lefte in Lucyfer er he were lowe fallen; Þey ben digne as dich water þat dogges in bayteþ. Loke a ribaut of hem þat can nou?t wel reden His rewle ne his respondes but be pure rote, Als as he were a connynge Clerke he casteþ þe lawes, Nou?t lowli but lordly &amp; leesinges lyeþ. For ry?t as Menoures most ypocricie vseþ, Ry?t so ben Prechers proude purlyche in herte. But, Cristen creatour we Karmes first comen Even in Elyes tyme first of hem all, And lyven by our Lady &amp; lelly hir seruen In clene comun life kepen vs out of synne; Nowt proude as prechours beþ but prayen full still For all þe soules and þe lyves þat we by lybbeth. We connen on no queyntyse (Crist wot þe soþe!) But bysieþ vs in oure bedes as vs best holdeþ. And þerfore, leue leel man leeue þat ich sygge, A masse of vs mene men is of more mede And passeth all praiers of þies proude freers. And þou wilt ?yuen vs and good y would þe here graunten To taken all þy penance in peril of my soule; And þou? þou conne nou?t þy crede clene þe assoile, So þat þou mowe amenden our hous wiþ money oþer elles, Wiþ som katell oþer corne or cuppes of siluer.” “Trewely, frere,” quaþy þo “to tellen þe þe soþe, Þer is no peny in my palke to payen for my mete; I haue no good ne no gold but go þus abouten, And travaile full trewlye to wynnen withe my fode. But woldest þou for godes loue lerne me my Crede, Y schuld don for þy will whan I wele hadde.” “Trewlie,” quaþ þe frere “a fol y þe holde! Þou woldest not weten þy fote &amp; woldest fich kacchen! Our pardon &amp; oure preiers so beþ þey nou?t parted, Oure power lasteþ nou?t so feer but we some peny fongen. Fare well,” quaþ þe frere “for y mot heþen fonden, And hyen to an houswife þat haþ vs bequeþen Ten pounde in hir testament to tellen þe soþe. Ho draweþ to þe deþe-warde but ?et I am in drede Lest ho turne her testament &amp; þerfore I hy?e To hauen hir to our hous and henten ?if y mi?te An Anuell for myn owen [vse] to helpen to cloþe.” “Godys forbode,” quaþ [his] fellawe “but ho forþ passe Wil ho is in purpose wiþ vs to departen; God let her no lenger lyven for letteres ben manye.” Þanne turned y me forþe and talked to my-selue Of þe falshede of þis folk whou feiþles they [weren]. And as y wente be þe waie wepynge for sorowe, [I] sei? a sely man me by opon þe plow hongen. His cote was of a cloute þat cary was y-called, His hod was full of holes &amp; his heer oute, Wiþ his knopped schon clouted full þykke; His ton toteden out as he þe londe treddede, His hosen ouerhongen his hokschynes on eueriche a side, Al beslombred in fen as he þe plow folwede; Twey myteynes, as mete maad all of cloutes; Þe fyngers weren for-werd &amp; ful of fen honged. Þis whit waselede in þe [fen] almost to þe ancle, Foure roþeren hym by-forn þat feble were [worþen]; Men my?te reken ich a ryb so reufull þey weren. His wijf walked him wiþ wiþ a longe gode, In a cutted cote cutted full hey?e, Wrapped in a wynwe schete to weren hire fro weders, Barfote on þe bare ijs þat þe bold folwede. And at þe londes ende laye a litell crom-bolle, And þeron lay a litell childe lapped in cloutes, And tweyne of tweie ?eres olde opon a-noþer syde, And alle þey songen o songe þat sorwe was to heren; Þey crieden alle o cry a carefull note. Þe sely man si?ede sore, &amp; seide “children, beþ stille!” Þis man loked opon me &amp; leet þe plow stonden, And seyde, “sely man, why sy?est þou so harde? ?if þe lakke lijflode lene þe ich will Swich good as God haþ sent go we, leue broþer.” Y saide þanne, “naye, sire my sorwe is wel more; For y can nou?t my Crede y kare well harde; For y can fynden no man þat fully byleueþ, To techen me þe hey?e weie &amp; þerfore I wepe. For y haue [fonded] þe freers of þe foure orders, For þere I wende haue wist but now my wit lakkeþ; And all my hope was on hem &amp; myn herte also; But þei ben fully feiþles and þe fend sueþ.” “A! broþer,” quaþ he þo “beware of þo foles! For Crist seyde him-selfe ‘of swiche y ?ou warne,’ And false profetes in þe feiþ he fulliche hem calde, ‘In vestimentis ouium but onlie wiþ-inne Þei ben wilde wer-wolues þat wiln þe folk robben.’ Þe fend founded hem first þe feiþ to destroie, And by his craft þei comen in to combren þe chirche, By þe coueiteise of his craft þe curates to helpen; But now þey hauen an hold þey harmen full many. Þei don nou?t after Domynick but dreccheþ þe puple, Ne folwen nou?t Fraunces but falslyche lybben, And Austynes rewle þei rekneþ but a fable, But purchaseþ hem pryuylege of popes at Rome. Þei coueten confessions to kachen some hire, And sepultures also some wayten to cacchen; But oþer cures of Cristen þei coveten nou?t to haue, But þere as wynnynge lijþ he lokeþ none oþer.” “Whou? schal y nemne þy name þat nei?boures þe kalleþ?” “Peres,” quaþ he, “þe pore man þe plowe-man y hatte.” “A! Peres,” quaþ y þo “y pray þe, þou me telle More of þise tryflers hou trechurly þei libbeþ? For ichon of hem haþ told me a tale of þat oþer, Of her wicked lijf in werlde þat hy lybbeþ. I trowe þat some wikked wy,t wrou?te þis orders [Þoru?] þat gleym of þat gest þat Golias is y-calde, Oþer ells Satan him-self sente hem fro hell To cumbren men wiþ her craft Cristendome to schenden?” “Dere broþer,” quaþ Peres “þe devell is ful queynte; To encombren holy Churche he casteþ ful harde, And fluricheþ his falsnes opon fele wise, And fer he casteþ to-forn þe folke to destroye. Of þe kynrede of Caym he caste þe freres, And founded hem on Farysens feyned for gode; But þei wiþ her fals faiþ michel folk schendeþ, Crist calde hem him-self kynde ypocrites; How often he cursed hem well can y tellen He seide ones him-self to þat sory puple, ‘Wo worþe ?ou, wy?tes wel lerned of þe lawe!’ Eft he seyde to hem-selfe ‘wo mote ?ou worþen, Þat þe toumbes of profetes tildeþ vp hei?e! ?oure faderes fordeden hem &amp; to þe deþ hem brou?te.’ Here y touche þis two twynnen hem I þenke; Who wilneþ ben wisere of lawe þan lewde freres, And in multitude of men ben maysters y-called, And wilneþ worchips of þe werlde &amp; sitten wiþ heye, And leueþ louynge of God and lownesse behinde? And in beldinge of tombes þei trauaileþ grete To chargen her chirche-flore and chaungen it ofte. And þe fader of þe freers defouled hir soules, þat was þe dygginge devel þat dreccheþ men ofte. Þe divill by his dotage dissaueþ þe chirche, And put in þe prechours y-paynted wiþouten: And by his queyntise þey comen in þe curates to helpen, But þat harmede hem harde and halp hem full litell! But Austines ordynaunce was on a good trewþe, And also Domynikes dedes weren [deruelich] y-vsed, And Frauncis founded his folke fulliche on trewþe, Pure parfit prestes in penaunce to lybben, In loue and in lownesse &amp; lettinge of pride, Grounded on þe godspell as God bad him-selue. But now þe glose is so greit in gladding tales Þat turneþ vp two-folde vnteyned opon trewþe, Þat þei bene cursed of Crist y can hem well proue; Wiþ-outen his blissinge bare beþ þey in her werkes. For Crist seyde him-selfe to swiche as him folwede, ‘Y-blessed mote þei ben þat mene ben in soule;’ And alle pouere in gost God him-self blisseþ. Whou fele freers fareþ so fayn wolde y knowe! Proue hem in proces &amp; pynch at her ordre, And deme hem after þat þey don &amp; dredles, y leue Þei willn wexen pure wroþ wonderlichc sone, And schewen þe a scharp will in a schort tyme, To wilne wilfully wraþþe &amp; werche þerafter. Wytnesse on Wycliff þat warned hem wiþ trewþe; For he in goodnesse of gost grayþliche hem warned To wayuen her wik[e]dnesse &amp; werkes of synne. Whou sone þis sori men [seweden] his soule, And oueral lollede him wiþ heretykes werkes! And so of þe blessinge of God þei bereþ litel mede. Afterward anoþer onliche he blissede, Þe meke of þe [myddel-erde] þouru? my?t of his fader. Fynd foure freres in a flok þat folweþ þat rewle, Þanne haue y tynt all my tast touche and assaie! Lakke hem a litil wi?t &amp; here lijf blame, But he lepe vp on hei? in hardynesse of herte, And nemne þe anon nou?t &amp; þi name lakke Wiþ proude wordes apert þat passeth his rule, Boþe wiþ ‘þou leyest, &amp; þou lext’ in heynesse of sowle, And turne as a tyrant þat turmenteþ him-selue, A lord were loþere for to leyne a k[n]aue Þanne swich a beggere þe beste in a toun! Loke nowe, leue man beþ nou?t þise i-lyke Fully to þe Farisens in fele of þise poyntes? Al her brod beldyng ben belded withe synne, And in worchipe of þe werlde her wynnynge þei holden; Þei schapen her chapolories &amp; streccheþ hem brode, And launceþ hei?e her hemmes wiþ babelyng in stretes; Þei ben y-sewed wiþ whi?t silk &amp; semes full queynte, Y-stongen wiþ stiches þat stareþ as siluer. And but freres ben first y-set at sopers &amp; at festes, Þei wiln ben wonderly wroþ ywis, as y trowe; But þey ben at þe lordes borde louren þey willeþ, He mot bygynne þat borde a beggere, (wiþ sorwe!) And first sitten in se in her synagoges, Þat beþ here hey?e helle-hous of Kaymes kynde! For þou? a man in her mynster a masse wolde heren, His si?t schal so [be] set on sundrye werkes, Þe penounes &amp; þe pomels &amp; poyntes of scheldes Wiþ-drawen his deuocion &amp; dusken his herte; I likne it to a lym-?erde to drawen men to hell, And to worchipe of þe fend to wraþþen þe soules. And also Crist him-selfe seide to swiche ypocrites, ‘He loueþ in markettes ben met wiþ gretynges of pouere, And lowynge of lewed men in Lent[e]nes tyme.’ For þei han of bichopes y-bou?t wiþ her propre siluer, And purchased of penaunce þe puple to assoile. But money may maken mesur of þe peyne, (After þat his power is to payen) his penance schal faile; (God lene it be a good help for hele of þe soules!) And also þis myster men ben maysters icalled, Þat þe gentill Iesus generallyche blamed, And þat poynt to his apostells purly defended. But freres hauen for?etten þis (and þe fend suweþ, He þat maystri louede Lucifer þe olde), Wher Fraunceis or Domynik oþer Austen ordeynide Any of þis dotardes doctur to worþe, Masters of dyvinitie her matens to leue, And chereliche as a cheueteyne his chambre to holden Wiþ chymene &amp; chapell &amp; chesen whan him liste, And serued as a souereine &amp; as a lorde sitten. Swiche a gome godes wordes grysliche gloseþ; Y trowe, he toucheþ nou?t þe text but takeþ it for a tale. God forbad to his folke &amp; fullyche defended Þey schulden nou?t stodyen biforn ne sturen her wittes, But sodenlie þe [same] word with her mowþ schewe Þat weren ?euen hem of God þoru? gost of him-selue. Now mot a frere studyen &amp; stumblen in tales, And leuen his matynes &amp; no masse singen, And loken hem lesynges þat likeþ þe puple, To purchasen him his pursfull to paye for þe drynke. And broþer, when bernes ben full &amp; holly tyme passed, Þanne comen cursed freres &amp; croucheþ full lowe; A losel, a lymitour ouer all þe lond lepeþ, And loke, þat he leue non house þat somwhat he ne lacche; And þer þei gilen hem-self &amp; godes worde turneþ. Bagges and beggyng he bad his folk leuen, And only seruen him-self &amp; hijs rewle sechen, And all þat nedly nedeþ þat schuld hem nou?t lakken. Whereto beggen þise men and ben nou?t so feble; (Hem faileþ no furrynge ne cloþes at full), But for a lustfull lijf in lustes to dwellen? Wiþ-outen any trauaile vntrewliche [hy] lybbeth. Hy beþ nou?t maymed men ne no mete lakkeþ, Y-cloþed in curious cloþ &amp; clenliche arayed. It is a laweles lijf as lordynges vsen, Neyþer ordeyned in ordir but onlie libbeþ.

All þo blissed beþ þat bodyliche hungreþ;— Þat ben þe pore penyles þat han ouer-passed Þe poynt of her pris lijf in penaunce of werkes, And mown nou?t swynken ne sweten but ben swyþe feble, Oþer maymed at myschef or meseles syke, And here good is a-gon &amp; greueþ hem to beggen. Þer is no frer in feiþ þat fareþ in þis wise; But he maie beggen his bred his bed is ygreiþed; Vnder a pot he schal be put in a pryvie chambre, Þat he schal lyuen ne last but litell while after! Al-mi?ti god &amp; man þe merciable blessed Þat han mercy on men þat misdon hem here;— But whoso for-gabbed a frere y-founden at þe stues, And brou?te blod of his bodi on bak or on side, Hym were as god greuen a greit lorde of rentes. He schulde sonner bene schryven (schortlie to tellen) Þou? he kilde a comlye kny?t &amp; compased his morþer, Þanne a buffet to beden a beggere frere.

For neþer souereyn ne soget þei ne suffreþ neuer; All þe blissing of God beouten þei walken; For of her suffraunce, for soþe men seþ but litell! Alle þat persecution in pure lijf suffren, Þei han þe benison of god blissed in erþe;— Y praie, parceyue now þe pursut of a frere, In what measure of meknesse þise men deleþ. Byhold opon Wat Brut whou bisiliche þei pursueden For he seyde hem þe soþe &amp; ?et, syre, ferþere, Hy may no more marren [hym] but men telleþ Þat he is an heretike and yuele byleueþ, And prechiþ it in pulpit to blenden þe puple; Þei wolden awyrien þat wi?t for his well dedes; And so þei chewen charitie as chewen schaf houndes. And þei pursueþ þe pouere &amp; passeþ pursutes, Boþe þey wiln &amp; þei wolden y-worþen so grete To passen any mans mi?t to morþeren þe soules; First to brenne þe bodye in a bale of fijr, And syþen þe sely soule slen &amp; senden hyre to helle!

Y mi?t tymen þo troiflardes to toilen wiþ þe erþe, Tylyen &amp; trewliche lyven &amp; her flech tempren! Now mot ich soutere his sone setten to schole, And ich a beggers brol on þe booke lerne, And worþ to a writere &amp; wiþ a lorde dwell, Oþer falsly to a frere þe fend for to seruen! So of þat beggers brol a bychop schal worþen, Among þe peres of þe lond prese to sitten, And lordes sones lowly to þo losells aloute, Kny?tes croukeþ hem to &amp; crucheþ full lowe; And his syre a soutere y-suled in grees, His teeþ wiþ toylinge of leþer tatered as a sawe! Alaas! þat lordes of þe londe leueþ swiche wrechen, And leneþ swiche lorels for her lowe wordes! Þey schulden maken bichopes her owen breþren childre, Oþer of some gentil blod &amp; so it best semed, And foster none faytoures ne swiche false freres To maken fatt &amp; full &amp; her fleche combren! For her kynde were more to y-clense diches Þan ben to sopers y-set first and serued wiþ siluer! A great bolle-full of benen were betere in his wombe, And wiþ þe randes of bakun his baly for to fillen, Þan pertriches or plouers or pekokes y-rosted, And comeren her stomakes wiþ curious drynkes, Þat makeþ swiche harlottes hordome vsen, And wiþ her wicked worde wymmen bitraieþ! God wold her wonynge were in wildernesse, And fals freres forboden þe fayre ladis chaumbres! For knewe lordes her craft trewlie, y trowe, Þey schulden nou?t haunten her hous so homly on ni?tes, Ne bedden swiche broþels in so brode schetes, But scheten her heued in þe stre to scharpen her wittes; Ne ben kynges confessours of custom ne þe counsell of þe rewme knowe! For Fraunces founded hem nou?t to faren on þat wise, Ne Domynik dued hem neuer swiche drynkers to worþe, Ne Helye ne Austen swiche lijf neuer vsed, But in pouerte of spirit spended her tyme. We haue sene our-self in a schort tyme, Whou freres wolden no flech among þe folke vsen; But now þe harlottes han hid thilke rewle, And, for þe loue of oure lorde haue leyd hire in water. Wenest þou þer wold so fele swiche warlawes worþen, Ne were wordlyche wele &amp; her welfare? Þei schulden deluen &amp; diggen &amp; dongen þe erþe, And mene-mong corn bred to her mete fongen, And wortes flechles wroughte &amp; water to drinken, And werchen &amp; wolward gon as we wrecches vsen; An aunter ?if þer wolde on amonge an hol hundred Lyuen so for godes loue in tyme of a wynter!” “Leue Peres,” quaþ y þo “y praie þat þou me tell Whou y maie conne my Crede in Cristen beleue?” “Leue broþer,” quaþ he “hold þat y segge, I will techen þe þe trewþe &amp; tellen þe þe soþe.” CREDO. Leue þou on oure Louerd God þat all þe werlde wrou?te, Holy heuen opon hey hollyche he fourmede, And is almi?ti him-self ouer all his werkes, And wrou?t as his will was þe we[r]lde and þe heuen; And on gentyl Jesu Crist engendred of him-seluen, His own onlyche sonne Lord ouer all y-knowen, [Þat] was clenly conseued clerlye, in trewþe, Of þe hey Holy Gost þis is þe holy beleue; And of þe mayden Marye man was he born, Wiþ-outen synnfull sede þis is fully þe beleue; Wiþ þorn y-crouned, crucified &amp; on þe crois dyede, And syþen his blessed body was in a ston byried, And descended a-doune to þe derk helle, And fet oute our formfaderes &amp; hy full feyn weren; Þe þridde daye rediliche him-self ros fram deeþ, And on a ston þere he stod he stei? vp to heuene, And on his fader ri?t hand redeliche he sitteþ, Þat al-mi?ti god ouer all oþer why?tes; And is hereafter to komen Crist, all him-seluen, To demen þe quyke and þe dede wiþ-outen any doute; And in þe hei?e holly gost holly y beleue, And generall holy chirche also hold þis in þy mynde; [The communion of sayntes for soth I to the sayn; And for our great sinnes forgiuenes for to getten, And only by Christ clenlich to be clensed; Our bodies again to risen right as we been here, And the liif euerlasting leue ich to habben; Amen.] And in þe [sacrement] also þat soþfast God on is, (Fullich his fleche &amp; his blod) þat for vs deþe þolede.— And þou? þis flaterynge freres wyln for her pride, Disputen of þis deyte as dotardes schulden, Þe more þe matere is moved þe [masedere hy] worþen. Lat þe losels alone &amp; leue þou þe trewþe, For Crist seyde it is so so mot it nede worþe; Þerfore studye þou nou?t þeron ne stere þi wittes, It is his blissed body so bad he vs beleuen. Þise maystres of dyvinitie many, als y trowe, Folwen nou?t fully þe feiþ as fele of þe lewede. Whou? may mannes wijt þoru? werk [of] him-selue, Knowen Cristes pryuitie þat all kynde passeþ? It mot ben a man of also mek an herte, Þat my?te wiþ his good lijf þat Holly Gost fongen; And þanne nedeþ him nou?t neuer for to studyen; He mi?te no maistre [ben] kald (for Crist þat defended), Ne puten [no] pylion on his pild pate; But prechen in parfite lijf &amp; no pride vsen. But all þat euer I haue seyd soþ it me semeþ, And all þat euer I haue writen is soþ, as I trowe, And for amending of þise men is most þat I write; God wold hy wolden ben war &amp; werchen þe better! But, for y am a lewed man paraunter y mi?te Passen par auenture &amp; in som poynt erren,</field>
