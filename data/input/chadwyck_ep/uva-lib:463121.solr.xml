      <field name="fulltext">The Heavens shall reveale his Iniquitie, and the Earth shall rise up against him. Job, 20. 27.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO M. G. M. In Gratious Street in London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEICESTER'S GHOST. I that sometimes shin'd like the orient Sunne, Though Fortunes subject, yet a puissant Lord, Am now an object to be gaz'd upon, An abject rather fit to be deplor'd Dejected now that whilome was ador'd: Affected once, suspected since of many Rejected now, respected scarce of any. My Spirit hovering in the foggie aire Since it did passe the frozen Stygian flood, Vnto great Britaines Empire did repaire; Where of Eliza's death I understood, And that the heavens carefull of Englands good Rais'd up a King, who crowned with loves peace Brought in new Ioyes &amp; made old griefes to cease. Thus from the concave vaults of starlesse night Where neither sunne nor moone vouchsaft to shine My wretched Ghost at length is come to light By charters granted from the powers divine Snake-eating envie, ô doe not repine At honours-shadow, doe not bite the dead, My pride is past, my pompe from th' earth is fled. My Princely birth, my high enobled state My somtime-dreadfull frownes now none regard; My great good-turnes to many done of late With gratefull hearts, now few or none reward My fame is blotted out, my honour scar'd; My monuments defac'd, my reliques torne Yea, vassailes doe my Excellency scorne. Ah silly peasants, as each Greeian boy, Would brave stout Hector being dead and cold, That whilome was the piller of old Troy. Whose presence living they durst scarce behold, Now since you see me dead you grow so bold, As to controle my acts, whose lookes did daunt The proudest Peeres that liv'd in Troynovant. A time there was, when stately Beares could clime, And in that time, was I a stately Beare; Who climb'd so fast and in a little time, That my high mounting other beasts did feare My fortunes, by their downfals I did reare: I now rejoyce, whilst others I made mourne, And serv'd the time to make time serve my turne. I was the off-spring of a Princely Syre He too well knew by his clime-falling pride Like Dedalus hee taught me to aspire; Wee both did flie, he fell, I did but slide; Like in attempts, yet unlike chance we tryed: Hee by a Queene did dye, and as that chanc'd, I by a Queene did live, and was advanc'd. For Lady Iane by him a Queene proclam'd Was soone supprest, Queene Mary got the Crowne, Which as her proper right she boldly claim'd, My Father striv'd in vaine to keepe her downe, And for that lost his life, I my renowne, Till sacred Cynthia to the Kingdome came, That gave new life to my late dying fame. That Peerelesse Queene of happie memory That late like Debora the Kingdome swaid, Now triumphs in the Iasper coloured skie With starre-embrodered vesture rich arrayed; Shee, shee restor'd my honours then decay'd When treason did attaint my Fathers bloud, And drown'd our Princely race in Lethes floud. Then Iupiter was in my Horoscope And Cinthia blest me with her faire aspect, What might not then my youth and courage hope When me my Soveraignes favour did protect, O what may not a Princesse grace effect When Majestie on hopelesse men doth smile Whose joyes did seeme to perish in exile. Even when Queene Maries tragick Raigne did end My comick fortunes in their prime begun That time when Cinthia's brightnesse did extend To lighten this darke Land whose splendant Sunne Was in Eclipse and sorrowes streame did runne I like the glorious day-starre did appeare With faire uprise, to grace this Hemispheare. Since Brute first sway'd all this united Land No Subject firmer held his Soveraignes grace, My will imperiall for a Law did stand, Such was my Princes pleasure, such my place, As Momus durst not offer me disgrace; What man did smile when Leisters brow did frowne Whose wit could guide, though never get the Crown. Whilst in this glorious Ocean I did swim To high preferment divers men I brought, Which since have sought my Honours Lamp to dim, Yea such as I before advanc'd of nought Against my person treacheries have wrought, Thus honours doe oft-times good manners change, And men grown rich to anci?t friends grow strange. I grieve to thinke, I did such men advance And raise their base lines to a stately pitch Vnder the shadow of my countenance The substance of the Earth did make them rich, What fury did their sences thus bewitch, Or was it some ill Spirit that possest them? To seeke my ruine, whose large bounty blest them. Thus they in vaine my downefall did conspire Like dogs that at the Moone doe fondly barke And did but burne themselves like Ætna's fire, Or like grim Owles did wonder in the darke Contem'd of me that mounted like the Larke, Or that rare bird that builds her nest on high In Cedar Trees whose tops affront the skie. When I commanded who durst countermand Were not meane subiects, subject to my beck, What man of worth my pleasure did with-stand, What simple swaines could doe, I did not wreake I gave the mate to those that gave me check By the Queenes helpe and threatning lookes I rul'd the pawnes, the Bishops, Knights, &amp; Rooks. Thus did I play at Chesse and wonne the game Having the queene my puissance to support, The Bishops for ambition did me blame The pawnes affirm'd I wan by much extort The Rooks &amp; Knights fo?d draughts to mar my sport, Had not some stopt me with their timely checks, I might have given them check without their necks. My braine had wit, my tongue was eloquent Fit to discourse or tell a Courtly tale My presence portly brave Magnificent, My words imperious, stout, substantiall My gestures loving, kind, Heroicall; My thoughts ambitious, proud, and full of ire, My deeds were good or bad as times require. Some of my foes that bare me deadly hate, That had to them chiefe Offices assign'd, And were my fellow Consuls in the State Iealous still of my aspiring mind Gave me this praise though otherwise vnkind, That I was wondrous politique and wise, A States-man that knew how to temporise. Some others tooke me for a zealous man Because good Preachers I did patronize, And many thought me a Precisian But God doth know, I never was precise I seem'd devout in godly exercise: And by Religious shew confirm'd my might But who durst say, I was an hypocrite. As Numa when he first did seeke to draw The Roman people underneath his yoke, Touching Religion he ordain'd a Law And feyned he with Nimph Egeria spoke That him to this good motion did provoke? Whereby as if it were with heavens consent He brought his men to civill government. So when I came in high affaires to deale Of sound Religion I did make a show And by pretence of hot and fervent zeale In wealth and faction I more strong did grow For this by practice I did plainly know; That men are apt to yeeld to any motion Made by a man that is of pure devotion. Yet could I straine my Conscience for a need, For though I seem'd an earnest Protestant For gaine I favour'd Papist so indeed, Some held me for a newter, and I grant To serve my turne I would turne Puritant: Thus by Religion, honour some doe winne And this faire cloke oft covers filthy sinne. Like as the ayre-sucking-Chamelion Can him transforme to any hue save white; So men can turne to any fashion Save to that forme which is sincere and right, For though he may delude the peoples sight, It is in vaine before God to dissemble Whose power the Divels know, &amp; knowing tremble. Was I the onely man that hath offended In making holinesse a cloake for sinne? The Frenchmen for religions sake pretended Their civill Warres of late time did begin, But yet ambition chiefly drew them in, Yea mad ambition, and desire of gaine Makes endlesse broyles betwixt the States &amp; Spain. Of promises, I was so prodigall, So kind, well spoken, and so liberall, That to some great Divine as it might fall Perhaps I promised a Bishoprick, But in performance I was nothing quick; Thus with faire words, mens humours oft I fed Whilst hope this while a good opinion bred. To learned Schollers I was something franck Not for the love that I to learning bore, But either to get praise or pick a thanke Of such as could the Muses aide implore To consecrate my name for evermore; For he is blest that so befriended dyes Whose praise the Muses will immortalize. You that desire to have your fame survive When you within your graves intomb'd shall lye, Cherish those sacred Sisters while you live For they be daughters of Dame memory Of the thundring Monarch of the sky: They have the gift to register with pen Th' eternall fame or infamy of men. The Students of the Vniversity Oxford whereof I was the Chancellor, That Nurse of science and Philosophy Knowing the greatnesse of my wit and power Did honour me as the faire springing flower; That in the Princesse favour highly grew Whom she with showers of gold did of bedew. At my command both Dee and Allen tended By Magick Art my pleasure to fulfill These to my service their best studies bended, And why they durst not disobey my will, Yea whatsoever was of secret skill In Oxford or in Cambridge to be sold I bought for love, for feare, or else for gold. Doubtlesse the most renown'd Philosophers As Plato and Pithagoras have sought To learne the Hierogliphick Characters And secrets which by Magick skill are wrought, Such as th' Egyptians, Iewes, and Chaldees taught: Th' art's not ill if men doe not abuse it, No fault so bad, but some men will excuse it. Lopus and Iulio were my chiefe Physitians, Men that were cunning in the Art to kill Good Schollers but of passing ill conditions, Such as could ridde mens lives yet no blood spill, Yea and with such dexterity and skill Could give a dram of poyson that could slay At end of the yeare, the moneth, the weeke or day. I never did these wicked men imploy To wrong my Prince or my true loving friend But false deceitfull wretches to destroy And bring them to an vnexpected end Let them looke to it that did most offend, Whose names are Registred in Pluto's scroules, For I will never answer for their soules. Knights and Esquires the best in every shire Did waite on me in England up and downe, And some among them did my Livery weare My smiles did seeme to promise them renowne, But dismall haps insu'd when I did frowne As when the starre Arcturus doth appeare Of raging Tempests Sea-men stand in feare. As for the Souldiers and the men of warre At home in service some I did retaine, Others I sent abroad not very farre At my commandment to returne againe, These I with cost did secretly maintaine That if ought chanced otherwise then well, I might haue sent my foes to heauen or hell. Likewise I brought the Lawyers in some awe, The worthy students of the Innes of court, That then applied them to the common Law, Did yeeld to me in matters of import, Although sometimes I did the Lawe extort, And whether right or wrong, my cause once heard, To plead against me made great Lords afeard. So the Lord Barkley, lost good lands by me, Whereof perchance at first he did not dreame, Might many times doth overcome the right, It is in vaine to strive against the streame, When he that is chiefe subiect in the Realme, Vpon his Princes favour rests him bold, He cannot or he will not be controld. Thus by the Queene my puissance was upheld, And for my foes I euer was too strong, The grace I had from her all feare expeld, I might wrong others, but not suffer wrong, So many men did unto me belong, Which on my favour chiefely did depend, And for my sake both goods, and land would spend. The best esteemed Nobles of the land. On whose support the publique state relied, Were linckt with me in friendships faithfull band, Or else in kindred nerely were allied, Their perfect loues and constant hearts I tried, The inferior sort at our devotion stood Ready to execute what we thought good. The Earle of Warwicke my owne loving brother My sisters Husband th' Earle of Huntington, The bounteous Earle of Bedford was another Of my best friends belov'd of every one Sir Henry Sidneys power in Wales well knowne: And there the Earle of Pembroke chiefe of all Of kinne my friend what ever thence might fall In Barwick my wives Vncle had chiefe power The Lord of Hunsdon my assured friend, In Ireland the Lord Grey was Governour, Gernsey and Iersey, likewise did depend Vpon such men, as did my will attend: Hoptoe my man Lieutenant of the Tower Was prompt to doe me service at an houre. Sir Edward Horsey in the Isle of Wight And noble Sir George Cary next bore sway, Men of great courage and no little might To take my part in any doubtfull fray In London the Recorder Fleetwood lay: That often us'd good words that might incense The Citizens to stand in my defence. The Prentises did likewise take my part As I in private quarrels oft have tryde, So that I had the very head and heart The Court and City leaning on my side, With Hattery some, others with gifts I plyd, And some with threats, stern looks &amp; angry words. I wonne to my defence with Clubs and Swords. Thus I by wisedome and fine pollicie, Maintain'd the reputation of my life, Drawing to me the flowre of Chivalrie To succour me at need in civill strife Men that lov'd change in every place were rife: And all the realme was w? my power possest Think what this might have wrought but judge the best. Like Claudius Marcellus drawne through Rome In his faire chariot which with Trophees deckt, Crowned with Garlands by the Senates doome, Whom they five times their Consul did elect That from their foes he might their lives protect: When he with conquest did his Country greet Loaden with spoyles lay prostrate at his feet. So did I ride in tryumph through chiefe townes As if I had beene Vice-roy of this Land, My face well grac'd with smiles, my purse with crownes Holding the reynes of honour in my hand, I managed the state, I did command: My lookes with humble majesty repleat, Made some men wish me a Kings royall seat. Thus waxt I popular to purchase fame To me the common peoples knees did bow, I could my humour still so fitly frame To entertaine all men to outward shew With inward love, for few my heart did know: And that I might not seeme puft up with pride Bare-headed oft through Cities I did ride. While some cry'd out, God save you gracious Lord, Lord how they did my fame hyperbolize My words and gestures did so well accord As with their hearts I seem'd to simpathize, I charm'd their eares and did inchant their eyes: Thus I was reckoned their chiefe Potentate No poller but a piller of the state. Then I was call'd the life and th' heart o'th' Court And some I wot wisht I had beene the head, I had so great a trayne and such a port, As did the pompe of Mortimer exceed, Who as in th' English Chronicles we read, When second Edward lost his Kingly rights Was waited on at once with nine-score Knights. That Earle of March and Roger Mortimer, Rul'd the young King, queene mother, and the Peeres I Robert Dudley Earle of Leicester, Did sway in court and all the English steeres, His rule was short, mine flourisht many yeares He did his life with ignominy loose, I lived and triumpht o're my proudest foes. As the Image of great Alexander dead, Made king Cassander tremble at the sight, Spying the figure of his Royall head, Whose presence sometime did the world affright, Or like as Cæsars Monarchising spright, Pursued false Brutus at Philippos field, Till he that slew his Liege himselfe was kild. So view yee petty Lords my Princely ghost, I speake to you whose hearts be full of gall, I whilst I liued was honour'd of the most, And either fear'd for love of great and small, Or lov'd for feare of such as wisht my fall, Behold my shadow representing state, Whose person sometime did your pride abate. Weigh what I was, knights, gentlemen, and Peeres, Wh? my death threatning frowns did make you quake As yet they have not passed many yeares, Since I your plumes pluckt, lofty crest's did shake Then tell me Sirs, for old acquaintance sake, Wax yee not pale to heare of Leisters name, Or to backebite me blush ye not for shame. You say in dealings that I was unjust, As if true Iustice ballance yee could guide, Had I dealt justly I had turnd to dust Long before this, your corps swolne vp with pride, Which now surviving doe my acts deride, My fame yet liues though death abridgd my daies, Some of you di'd that over-liu'd your prayse. Are there not some among you Parasites, Time-servers, and observers of no measure, Prince-pleasers, people-pleasers, hypocrites, Dambd Machiavilians giuen to lust and pleasure, Church-robbers, beggers of the Princes treasure, Truce-breakers, Pirats, Athiests, Sicophants, Can equity dwell heere where conscience wants. And yet you thinke none justly deales but you, Divine Astrea vp to heauen is fled, And turnd to Libra, there looke up and view Her ballance in the zodiacke figured, Iust Aristides once was banished, Where liues his match whom enuy did pursue Because men thought he was to just and true. Yee say, ambition harbourd in my braine, I say ambition is no heynous sinne To men of state, do stately thoughts pertaine, By baser thoughts what honour can he win, Who ever did a great exploit begin, Before ambition moved him to the deed And hope of honour, urg'd him to proceed. Themistocles had never put to flight, Zerxzes huge host, nor tam'd the Persians pride, Nor sad King Tarsus got by martiall fight, The Romane spoyles with conquest on his side, If first ambition had not beene their guide, Had not this humor their stout hearts allure, To high attempts their fame had beene obscure. The Eagle doth disdaine to catch poore flyes, The Lyon with the Ape doth scorne to play, The Dolphin doth the whirlpoole low dispise, Thus if Birds, Beasts, and Fishes beare such sway, If they would teach vnderlings to obey, Much more should men whom reason doth adorne, Be noble minded and base fortunes scorne. Admit I could dissemble wittily, This is no grievous sinne in men of state; Dissembling is a point of policie Plaine dealing now growes stale and out of date: Wherefore I oft conceal'd my private hate Till I might find fit time though long I stay'd To wreake the wrath that in my heart I layd. Th' old Proverbe is, plaine dealing is a jewell, And he that useth it a Begger dyes, The world is now adayes become so cruell That Courtiers doe plaine Country-men despise, Quicke wits and cunning heads doe quickly rise. And to be plaine, yee must not plainly deale That office seeke in Court or Common-weale. Now Aristippus is in more request That knew the way to please a Monarchs mind, Then that poore cynicke swad that us'd to jest At every idle knave that he could find, To unkind friends yee must not be too kind: This is a maxime which to you I give, Men must dissemble or they cannot live. Yee say, I was a coward in the field, I say it fits not such a noble wight To whom his Countrey doth the title yeeld Of Lord-Lieutenant with full power and might To venture his owne person in the fight: Let others dye, which as our vassailes serve While heaven for better haps our hopes preserve. How soone did Englands joy in France diminish When th' Earle of Salisbury at Orleance By Gun-shot stroke, his honour'd life did finish; When Talbot that did oftentimes advance The English ensignes in disgrace of France, Was at the last invironed and slaine Whose name the French-mens terror doth remaine. And what a fatall wound did Rome receive By Crassus death whom faithlesse Parthians slew, How did the Senate for Flaminius grieve And for Æmilius death, and his stout crew, Whom Haniball at Cannes did subdue: Cut off an arme, yet life the heart may cherish Cut of the head and every part will perish. Ipeorates th' Athenian us'd to say, Vaunt-currers are like hands to battell prest The men of armes are feet whereon to stay, The footmen as the stomach and the brest, The captaine as the head above the rest: The head once crased troubleth all the parts, The Generall slaine doth kill ten thousand hearts. Therefore a Lord Lieutenant should take care That he in safety doe himselfe repose And should not hazard life at every dare, But watch and ward, so Fabius tir'd his foes When rash Minutius did the conquest lose: If such in open danger will intrude It is fond rashnesse and not fortitude. Yee say, I was lascivious in my love And that I tempted many a gallant Dame, Not so content, but I did also prove To winne their handmaids if I lik'd the game, Why sits yee know, love kindles such a flame As if we may believe what Poets pen It doth inchant the hearts of Gods and men, Iove lov'd the daughter of a jealous sire Danae a maid immured within a tower, Yet to accomplish th' end of his desire He metamorphiz'd to a golden shower Fell in the lap of his faire Paramour: And being tearm'd a god did not disdaine To turne to man, to beast, and showre of raine. Deere Lords, when Cupid throwes his fiery darts Doth none of them your tender bodies hit, Doth Citherea never charme your hearts, Nor beauty try your quintessentiall wit Perhaps you will say no, fie 'tis unfit, Now by my Garter, and my George to boot, The blind God surely hits, if he doth shoote. Whereas ye doe object my Magick charmes, I sought to winne faire dames to my desire, 'Tis better so then strive by force of Armes For forced love will quickly backe retire If faire meanes cannot winne what we require: Some secret tricks and sleights must be devised That love may even from Hell be exercised. To you dull wit it seemes impossible By drinkes or charmes this worke to passe to bring, Know then that Giges were invisible By turning the sigill of his Ring Toward his palme and thereby slew the King, Lay with his wife of any man unseene Lastly did raigne by marrying with the queene. King Salomon for Magick naturall Was held a cunning man by some Divines, He wrote a booke of Science naturall To bind ill Spirits in their darke confines He had great store of wives and Concubines, Yet was a Sacred King, this I inferre The wisest man that now doth live may erre. Also yee say, that when I waxed old When age and time mispent had made me dry, For ancient, held in carnall Lust is cold, Natures defect with Art I did supply And that did helpe this imbecility, I us'd strong drinks and Oyntments of great price, Whose taste or touch might make dead flesh arise. To this I answer: that those fine extractions, Drams and electuaries finely made, Serv'd not so much to helpe veneriall actions, As for to comfort nature that's decaid: Which being with indifferent judgment weigh'd, In noble men may be allowed I trust, As tending to their health, not to their lust. What if I drinke nothing but liquid gold, Lactrina, christal, pearle resolv'd in wine, Such as th' Egyptians full cups did hold, When Cleopatra with her Lord did dine; A trifle, care not, for the cost was mine? What if I gave Hippomenes to drinke To some fair Dames, at smal faults you must wink? Ye say I was a traytor to the Queene, And that when Monsieur was in greatest grace, I being out of favour, mov'd with spleene, To see a Frenchman frolique in the place, Forth toward Barwick then did post apace, Minding to raise up a rebellious rout, To take my part in what I went about. That I was then a traytor I deny, But I confesse that I was Monsieurs foe, And sought to breake the league of amity, Which then betwixt my Prince and him did grow, Doubting Religion might be changed so, Or that our Lawes and customes were in danger, To be corrupt or altered by a stranger: Therefore I did a faction strong maintaine, Against the Earle of Sussex, a stout Lord On Monsieurs side, and then Lord Chamberlain, Who sought to make that nuptiall accord, Which none may breake, witnesse the sacred Word: But thus it chanced, that he striv'd in vaine To knit that knot which heaven did not ordaine. Thus did ye mis-interpret my conceits, That for disloyalty my deeds did blame, Yet many men have laid their secret baits, T'intrap me in such snares to work my shame, Whom I in time sufficiently did tame; And by my Soveraignes favour bore them downe, Proving my selfe true Liegeman to the Crowne. Thinke yee I could forget my Soveraigne Lady, That was to me so gracious and so kinde? How many triumphs for her glory made I? O I could never blot out of my minde, What Characters of grace in her have shin'd. But some of you, which were by her prefer'd, Have with her bones almost her name inter'd. When she was gone, which of you all did weep? What mournfull song did Philomela sing? Alas! when she in deaths cold bed did sleep, Which of you all her dolefull knell did ring? How long will yee now love your crowned King, If you so soon forget your old Queen dead, Which foure and fourty yeares hath governed? Yee say, I sought by murder to aspire, And by strong poyson many men to slay, Which as ye thought might crosse my high desire, And cloud my long expected golden day, Perhaps I laid some blocks out of my way, Which hindred me from comming to the Bower, Where Cynthia shin'd like lamps in Pharohs tower. Alas! I came not of a Tygers kinde, My hands with bloud I hated to defile; But when by good experience I did finde, How some with fained love did me beguile, Perchance all pitty then I did exile; And as it were against my will, was prest To seek their deaths that did my life detest. Lo then, attend to heare a dolefull tale Of those whose death yee doe suppose I wrought, Yet wish I that the world beleeve not all That hath of me by envious men been wrought, But when I for a Kingly fortune sought, O pardon me, my selfe I might forget, And cast downe some, my state aloft to set. My first wife fell downe from a paire of staires, And brake her neck, and so at Comner dy'd, Whilst her true servants led with small affaires. Unto a Faire at Abingdon did ride, This dismall hap did to my wife betide; Whether yee call it chance or destiny, Too true it is, she did untimely dye. O had I now a showre of teares to shed, Lockt in the empty circles of my eyes, All could I shed in mourning for the dead, That lost a spouse so young, so faire, so wise, So faire a corps so foule a coarse now lies, My hope t'have married with a famous Queene, Drave pitty back, and kept my teares unseene. What man so fond that would not lose a Pearle To finde a Diamond, leave brasse for gold: Or who would not forsake a gallant girle, To win a Queen, great men in awe to hold, To rule the State, and of none be control'd? O but the steps that lead unto a throne, Are dangerous for men to tread upon. The Cardinall Chatillion was my foe, Whose death peradventure did compact, Because he let Queen Elizabeth to know My false report given of a former act, How I with her had made a precontract. And the great Princes hope I bar'd thereby, That sought to marry with her Majesty. The Prelate had bin better held his tongue, And kist his holy Fathers feet in Rome: A Masse the sooner for his soule was sung; But he might thanke me, had he staid at home, Or late or never he to heaven had come: Therefore I sent him nimbly from the coasts, Perhaps to supper with the Lord of hosts. When death by hap my first wives neck had crackt, And that my suit unto the Queene ill sped, It chanced that I made a post contract, And did in sort the Lady Sheffeild wed, Of whom I had two goodly children bred: For the Lord Sheffeild died as I was sure, Of a Catarre, which physicke could not cure. Some thinke the rhume was artificiall, Which this good Lord before his end did take: Tush, what I gave to her was naturall, My plighted troth yet some amends did make, Though her at length, unkinde I did forsake; She must not blame me, for a higher reach Made my sure promise finde a sudden breach. The valiant Earle whom absent I did wrong, In breaking Hymeneus holy band; In Ireland did protract the time too long, Whilst some in England ingled under hand, And at his coming homeward to this land He dyed with poyson, as they say, infected, Not without cause, for vengeance I suspected: Because this fact notorious scandall bred, And for I did his gallant wife abuse; To salve this sore when this brave Lord was dead, I for my selfe did this faire Lady chuse, And flesh is fraile, deare Lady me excuse; It was pure love that made me undertake, This haplesse recontract with thee to make. Now in Joves pallace that good Lord doth sup, And drinke full bowles of Nector in the skie. Hunnies his page, that tasted of that cup, Did onely loose his haire, and did not dye; True-noble Earle, thy fame to heaven doth flye. He doth repent his fault, and pardon crave, That marr'd thy bed and too soon made thy grave? Thou didst behinde thee leave a matchlesse Sonne, A peerelesse paterne for all princely peeres, Whose sparks of glory in my time begun, Kindled with hope, flam'd highly in few yeeres, But death him struck, and drown'd this land in teares; His Sonne doth live true image of him dead, To grace this soil, where showers of tears were shed. They were to blame that said the Queen should marry With me her Hors keeper, for so they call'd me. But thou Throgmarton which this tale didst carry From France to England, hast more sharply gall'd me, Sith my good Queene in office high extold me; For I was Master of her Highnesse Horse, I scorne thy words, which did my hate inforce. But tell me then, how didst thou like thy fare, When I to supper last did thee invite? If I did rid thee of a world of care, By giving thee a Salet, gentle Knight, With gastly lookes doe not my soule affright: Lester I was, whom England once did dread, But now I am like thee Throgmarton, dead. My Lord of Sussex was too cholerick, That call'd me traitor and a traitors sonne; But I serv'd him a fine Italian trick; Had not I done so, I had bin undone; Now marke the end, what conquest hath he won? A litle scruple that to him I sent, Did purge his choler, till his life was spent. He was a gallant Noble man indeed; O but his life did still my life decrease: Therefore I sent him with convenient speed, To rest amongst his ancestors in peace: My rage was pacifi'd at his decease. And now I come t'imbrace his love too late, Him did I love, whom living I did hate. I came to visit as I chanc'd to walke My Lady of Lenox, whom I found not well, I took her by the hand, had private talke, And so departed, a short tale to tell: When I was gone, into a flux she fell, That never ceast her company to keep, Till it had brought her to a senslesse sleep. I dream'd she had not many dayes to live; And this my dreame did shortly fall out true, So as her Ghostly Father I did give Some comfort to her soule: for well I knew That she would shortly bid the world adiew. Some say I gave such physick as did spill her; But I suppose that meere conceit did kill her. Some will object perhaps, I did pretend To meet the Earle of Ormond on a day, In single fight our quarrell for to end; But did command my servant Killygray, To lye in ambush that stout Lord to slay. But heaven did not consent to work his spoile, That was the glory of the Irish soile. Perhaps I doubted that I was too weake, And loath I was he should the conquest win: If in this cause I did my promise breake, I hope men will not count it for a sin; Is it not good to sleep in a whole skin? When Hannibal could not prevaile by blowes, He used stratagems to kill his foes. If I the death of Monsieur Simiers fought, When he from France Ambassadour was sent, I had just cause to seeke it as I thought; For towards me he bore no good intent; Had he not fled betimes, perhaps I ment T'have sent him in embassage for my pleasure To the black king that keeps Avernus treasure. For when no man about the Court durst speak, That I the Lady Lettice married, This pratling Frenchman first the ice did breake, And to the Queene the fact discovered; Which not without just cause the anger bred: Thus th' ape did play his part control'd of none, When he espi'd the Beare from home was gone. One Salvadore an Italian borne, Having once watcht with me till mid'st of night, Was found slaine in his bed the next day morne: Alas poore man I rue his wofull plight, That did in nothing but in sinne delight: Had he to honest actions bent his wit, He might have longer liv'd and scap'd this fit. But what reward should such a man expect, Whom gold to any lewdnesse could entice, Ones turne once serv'd, why should we not reject So vilde an instrument of damned vice? What if he were dispatched in a trice? Was it not better this mans blood to spill, Then let him live the world with sinne to fill? I doubted lest that Doughty would bewray My counsell, and with others party take; Wherefore, the sooner him to rid away, I sent him forth to sea with Captaine Drake, Who knew how t'entertain him for my sake; Before he went his lot by me was cast, His death was plotted, and perform'd in hast. He hoped well; but I did so dispose, That he at Port St. Iulian lost his head, Having no time permitted to disclose The inward griefes that in his heart were bred: We need not feare the biting of the dead: Now let him goe transported to the seas, And tell my secrets to th' Antipodes. My servant Gates did speed as ill or worse, To whom I did my close intents impart, And at his need with money stuft his purse, And wil'd him still take courage at his heart; Yet in the end he felt the deadly smart: He was inveigled by some subtle witted, To rob; so he was taken and committed. Of pardon I did put him still in hope, When he of felony was guilty found, And so condemn'd, till his last friend the Pope Did him uphold from falling to the ground. What hope of grace where vice did so abound. He was beguil'd like birds that use to gape At Zouxes table for a painted grape. Yet I did to the man no injury, And gave him time and leasure to repent, And well he knew he had deserv'd to dye, Therefore all future mischiefe to prevent, I let him slip away with my consent: For his reprivall, like a crafty Fox, I sent no pardon but an empty Box. Else as unfaithfull Banester betraid The Duke of Buckingham his Master deare, When he of Richards tyranny afraid, Fled to his servants house for succour there: So might my man for gaine, or forc'd for feare, Have brought my corps with shame unto my grave, By too much trusting on a paltry knave. Me seems at me great Norfolkes Duke doth frowne, Because he thinkes I did his death contrive, Perswading some he aimed at the Crowne, And that by royall match he meant to strive A kingdome to his Lordship to revive. Alas good Duke! he was too meek and milde, And I too faithlesse that his trust beguil'd. For that I found his humour first was bent To take the Scots captived Queen to wife, I egg'd him on to follow his intent, That by this meanes I might abridge his life, And she a crowned Queen to stint all strife, First finding Scotland lost, to England fled, Where she in hope of succour lost head. O blessed Spirits, live yee evermore In heavenly Sion, where your maker reignes, And give me leave my fortunes to deplore, That am fast fetterd with sins iron chaines. Mans most sweet joys are mixt with some foul pains. And doth he live of high or low degree, In life or death that can from woe be free? Ah now my tongue growes weary to recite Such massacres as have been here exprest, Whose sad remembrance doth afflict my spright, Me thinkes I see legions of soules to rest In Abrahams bosome, and my selfe opprest. The burden of my sinnes doe weigh me downe, At me the fiends doe laugh, and Angels frowne. My crimes I grant were geat and manifold, Yet not so heynous as men make report, But flattering Parasites are growne so bold That they of Princes matters make a sport, To please the humors of the vulgar sort: And that poore peevish giddiheaded crue, Are prone to credit any tale untrue. Let those that live endeavour to live well, Lest after death like mine their guilt remaine; Let no man thinke there is no Heaven or Hell, Or with the impious Sadduces maintaine That after death no flesh shall rise againe: Let no man trust on Fortunes fickle wheele, The guerdon due for thine I partly feele. Know that the Prince of heavenly Saraphins, When he 'gainst his Creator did rebell, Was tumbled downe for his presumptuous sinne; Sathan that once was blest like lightning fell From the highest heaven, to the deepest hell: And all those Angells that his part did take, Have now their portion in the burning lake. Of mighty heapes of treasure I could vant, For I reapt profit out of every thing, I could the Prince and peoples hearts inchant. With my faire words and smoothfac'd flattering, And out of drosse pure gold I oft did wring: For though the meanes to win be oft unmeet, The smell of lucre ever smelleth sweet. So I somtimes had very much good hap Great suites of my dread Soveraigne to obtaine, Prodigall fortune powr'd down from her lap, Angels of gold as thick as drops in raine. Such was my luck to finde the golden veine; Likewise with me it seemed nothing strange, Both rents and lands oft with my Prince to change. I had another way t'inrich my selfe By geting licences for me alone, For Wine, Oyle, Velvet, Cloath, and such like pelfe, By licences to alienation, By raising rents, and by oppression: By claiming Forrests, Pastures, Commons, Woods, And forfeiture of lands, of life and goods. By this strong course also I greatly thrived In falling out with my deere Soveraigne, For I the Plot so cunningly contrived, That reconcilement soone was made againe, And by this meanes great gifts I did obtaine: For that I might my bags the better fill, I beg'd great suites as pledge of new goodwill. Besides somtimes I did encrease my store, By benefit that I from Oxford tooke, Electing heads of houses heretofore, I lov'd their money, and they lov'd their booke, Some poorer though more learned I forsooke: For in those daies your charity was cold, Little was done for love, but much for gold. Doubtlesse my Father was a valiant Peere In Edward the sixt daies when he was sent, Gainst Rebells that did rise in Norfolke shire. And after that when he to Scotland went, Under the Lord Protectors Regiment; By notable exploits against the Scot, Eternall glory to himselfe he got. Truly ambition was his greatest fault, Which commonly in noble hearts is bred, He thought the never could his state exalt Till the good Duke of Sumerset was dead, Who by my Fathers meanes did lose his head: So ill the race of Dudlies could endure The Seymors lives which did their fame obscure. When once King Edward at the butt had shot, My Father sayd, your Grace shoots neere the mark, The King repli'd, but not so neere I wot, As when you shot my Vncles head off quite: The duke my Father knew the King said right, And that he ment this matter to debate If ere hee liv'd to come to mans estate. It seemes my Father in times past had been A skillfull Archer, though no learned clerke, So strange a chance as this is seldome seen, I doe suppose he shot not in the dark, That could so quickly hit so faire a mark: Nor have I mist my aime, nor worse have sped, When I shot off the Duke of Norfolks head. Now when the Duke of Somerset was dead, My Father to the French did Bulloigne sell, As pleased him the King he governed, And from the privy counsell did depell Th' earles of Southampton, and of Arundell: Thus whilst he ruled and controuled all. The wise young King extreamly sick did fall. Who having languisht long, of life deprived, Not without poison as it was suspected; The counsell through my Fathers meanes contrived That Suffolks Daugther should be Queen elected, The Sisters of King Edward were rejected: My brother Guilford to Iane Gray was wedded, Too high preferr'd that was so soone beheaded. This Lady Iane that once was tearmed Queeen, Greater in fame then fortune, was put downe, Had not King Henries Daughters living been, Might for her vertues have deserv'd a Crowne; Fortune at once on her did smile and frowne: Her wedding garment for a Princes meet Was quickly changed for a winding sheet. For I was iump of Julius Cesars minde That could no one superior Lord endure, Nay I to guide my Soveraigne was inclin'd, And bring the common people to my lure, Accounting that my fortune was obscure, And that I lived in a wofull plight If any one eclipst my glorious light. The love to reigne makes many men respect Neither their friend, their kindred, nor their vow, The love to reigne makes many men neglect The duty which to God and man they ow, From out this fountaine many mischeifes flow: Hereof examples many may be read In Chronicles of th' English Princes dead. This humor made King Harrold break his oath Made unto William Duke of Normandy: This made King Rufus and young Beauclark both Their elder Brother Robert to defie, And Stephen to forget his loialty To Mawa the Empresse, and to hold in scorne The faithfull oath which he to her had sworne. This made young Henry crowned by his sire, Against his Father Warfare to maintaine: This made King Iohn the kingdome to aspire, Which to his Nephew Arthur did pertaine, And him in prison hardly to retaine: And this made Bullingbrook t'usurp the Crowne, Putting his lawfull Soveraigne Richard downe. This made Edward the fourth at his returne From Burgundy, when he to Yorke was come, To break the oath which he had lately sworne, And rule the Realme in good King Henries roome; This made the Tyrant Richard eke to doome His Nephewes death, and rid away his wife, And so in bloud to end his wretched life. A prety plot in practice I did put, Either to take a Queene without delay, Or when the cards were shuffled and well cut, To chuse the King and cast the knaves away; He should be cunning that great game would play; Ill luck hath he that no good game can make, When Princes play and crownes lye at the stake. First I assayed Queene Elizabeth to wed, Whom divers Princes courted, but in vaine; When in this course unluckily I sped, I sought the Scots Queenes mariage to obtaine; But when I reapt no profit for my paine, I sought to match Denbigh my tender childe To Dame Arbella, but I was beguil'd. Even as Octavius with Marke Anthony, And Lepidus the Roman Empire shar'd, That of the world then held the soveraignty, So I a new Triumverat prepar'd, If death a while yong Denbighs life had spar'd, The grandame, uncle and the father in law, Might thus have brought all England under awe. In the low Countries did my fame soare high, When I was sent Lievtenant generall, The Queenes proud foes I stoutly did deny, And made them to some composition fall, There I maintained port majesticall; In pompe and triumph many dayes I spent, From noble then my name grew excellent, Then was my heart in height of his desire, My minde puft up with surquedry and pride: The vulgar sort my glory did admire, Even as the Romans Ave Cæsar cri'd, When the Emperour to the Senat house did ride; So did the Flemings with due reverence, Like thunder say, God save your Excellence. Few Subjects before me obtain'd this stile, Unlesse they were as Viceroyes of this land: The name of Lordship seem'd too base and vile, To me that govern'd such a royall band, And had a Princes absolute command: Who did not of my puissance stand in awe, That might put him to death by martiall law? Loe, what a title hath my honour got, And Excellency added to my name? Can this injurious world so quickly blot A name so great out of records of fame, Covering my glory with a vale of shame? Or will it now contemne me being dead, Whom living even with feare it honoured? The towne of Densborough I did besiege, Which did on composition shortly yeeld: I did good service to my gracious liege, Till by ill councellours I was beguil'd: For such as were my Captains in the field, To whom at length chiefe charge I did commit, Seduced me to many things unfit. When Sir Iohn Norris counsell I refused, Whose perfect skill in feats of armes I knew, By Rowland Yorkes device I was abused, Whereon some losse soone after did ensue; Deventer towne and Zutphen sconce I rue, By Yorke and Stanley without many blowes, Were rendred to the mercy of the foes. And that which to my heart might more griefe strike, Happened the death of that renowned Knight, My Nephew Sidney, neere Coleston dike Receav'd his deadly wound through fortunes spight, I sent no fresh supply to him in fight; I was not farre off with a mighty host: So with his losse of life some fame I lost. The Court in him lost a brave Courtier; The Countrey lost a guide, their faults to mend; The Campe did loose an expert Souldier; The City lost an honourable friend: The Schooles a patron, their right to defend: The Court, the Countrey, the Schools &amp; City, For Sidneys death still sing a mournfull dity. Now while my princely glory did abound, Like rich Lucullus I great feasts did make, And was for hospitality renown'd: The use of armes I quickly did forsake; An easier taske I ment to undertake: I tooke no joyes in wounds and broken pates, But to carouse and banquet with the States. Not Heliogebalus, whose dainty fare, Did all the Roman Emperours feast exceed In cost and rarenesse, might with mine compare, Though he on braines of Ostriches did feed And Phenicopteines, and that instead Of oyle he us'd his lamps with balme to fill: Such was the pleasure of this tyrants will. To me Count Egmounts daughter did resort, Of such brave Dames as Flanders still did yeeld; That it did rather seeme I came to court A gallant Lady, then to pitch a field; For I did lay aside the sword and shield: At cards and dice I spent the vacant dayes, And made great feasts, instead of martial fraies. But whilst in games and love my time I spent, Seeming secure, as though I car'd for nought: My messengers abroad I daily sent, As instruments of my still working thought, Whereby my purpose oft to passe I brought, And compasse what before I did devise, At such a time as no man will surmise. Thus great attempts I oft did enterprise, Like a Magician that with some fine wile Dazles the sight of the spectators eyes, And with illusions doth their sense beguile, Such policies my cunning did compile, That I before mens eyes did cast a mist, While I perform'd such matters as I list. Ye that like apes doe imitate my deeds, Hoping thereby like favour to obtaine; Know that so high a spirit never breeds In a blunt peasant, or unnurtured swaine, But in my heart imperious thoughts did reigne: No flegmatick dull milk-sop can aspire, But one compact of th' element of fire. He daily must devise some stratagem, He must be rich, stout, liberall, and wise, The humours of base men he must contemne, He must be gracious in the peoples eyes, He should be furnisht with rare qualities, With learning, judgement, policy and wit, And such like parts as for the time are fit. For every forward fellow is not borne To be a Scipio or a Maximus, Unlesse that wisedome doth his state adorne, Or valour make his life more glorious, Though he be base of birth like Marius, Yet he by vertues aid aloft may come, Like him that was seven times Consull in Rome. Ventidius name at first was meane and base, Till he the Parthians host had overthrowne, And Cicero came not of noble race, Borne at Arpinia a poore country towne, Yet he made armes give place unto the gowne. And Rome by his great wisdome freed from spoile. Call'd him the father of their native soile. Perhaps young Courtiers learne something to sing: To skip or dance before their Mistris face, To touch like Orpheus some inchanting string, To run at alt, to jet with stately pace, Or by some fine discourse to purchase grace, But cannot manage the affaires of State, Which best belongs to each great Potentate. Listen to me ye lusty Souldiers, That in such favour high attempt to grow, Experience bred in me this manly yeares, Hath taught me cunning which you doe not know, Some precepts here I doe intend to show: And if my Syren song please not great Peeres, Then may they with Ulysses stop their eares. Trust not a friend that is new reconcil'd, In loves faire shew he may hide foule deceit, By him ye unawares may be beguil'd, Reveale to none your matters of great waight, If any chance to know your lewd conceit, Suspected to bewray your bad intent, He ought to suffer death and banishment. Caligula the scourge of famous Rome, Wisht all the Romanes had onely one head, That when he list to give their fatall doome, He might with one great blow strike all them dead, So should he never need their hate to dread: Even such a mischiefe I wisht to my foes, That many men might perish with few blowes. But unto those that doe your favour seeke, And by your helpe hope their low states to raise, You must be courteous, bountifull, and meeke: Cæsar by clemency won greatest praise, And was esteem'd the mirrour of his dayes. For it belongs to men of great estate, To spare the poore, and rich mens mindes abate. It's ill to be a rub upon that ground Whereas the Prince the alley meanes to sweep, Their owne conceits they fondly doe confound, That into high attempts doe boldly creep, And with their shallow pates doe wade so deep, To hinder what their Soveraigne doth intend, Or to controule what they cannot amend. Calisthenes much torment did sustaine, Because great Alexanders pride he checkt, Grave Seneca choosing his death was slaine By Nero's doome, whose faults he did correct: Use not too sharpe rebukes, but have respect Unto the persons, when great men doe evill, The vengeance leave to God, or to the devill. Be not too haughty, pride procureth hate, And meane mens hate may turne to your disgrace, Nor too familiar be in high estate, For that will breed contempt among the base, Observe a meane which winneth man much grace: Speake well to all, trust none, use well your foes, For this may purchase love where hatred growes. And if that you doe feare your friend should chance To mount too highly in the Princes grace, His praise to heaven then stick not to advance, Say that the charge he beareth is too base, And that his worth deserves farre better place, So may you by this praise rid him away, And so supply his place another day. Say he will prove a terror in the field, This private life doth much obscure his fame, More fit to beare great Ajax sevenfold shield, Then like Sardanapalus court a dame, He idlely lives at home, it is a shame. His very presence may his foes appall, Let him be sent Lieutenant Generall. Now if he chance to perish in some fight, It was not your worke, but the chance of warres, Or thus you may excuse your selves by sleight, Blaming the influence of the angry starres, That thus by death his future fortune barres, And (sighing) we are sory, you may say, That this brave man would cast himselfe away. But if in feats of armes he have no skill, If he be learned, wise, and eloquent, By praising him thus may you have your will, Procure him in ambassage to be sent Far off, lest he returne incontinent, As to the mighty Cham, or Prestor Iohn, And triumph in his roome when he is gone. Let no man think I exercis'd the ghost Of this great Peere that sleepeth in the dust, Or conjur'd up his spirit to this coast, To presse him with despaire, or praise unjust: I am not partiall, but give him his due, And to his soule I wish eternall health: Ne doe I think all written tales are true, That are inserted in his Commonwealth: What others wrote before, I do survive, But am not like to those incenst with hate, And as I plainly write, so doe I strive To write the truth, not wronging his estate: Of whom it may be said, and censur'd well, He both in vice and vertue did excell. Iamque opus exegi, Dens dedit his quoque finem. FINIS.</field>
