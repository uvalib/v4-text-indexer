      <field name="fulltext">? Verba decent iratum plena minarum. Horat:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Author pro seipso. Looke nought for heere of Writers commendation: Ile not be thought one of their Fauour-winners: Which would to Lamenesse seeme but supportation, Or as an Offering made for Young-Beginners. Who knowes not, Tauernes painted Posts, and Signes, Are but th' attractiues to deceitfull wines? Ad Bibliopolam. Printer or Stationer, or what ere thou prooue, Shalt mee record to Times posteritie: Ile not enioyne thee, but request in loue, Thou so much deigne my Booke to dignifie; As first it bee not with your Ballads mixt, Next, not at Play-houses, mongst Pippins solde: Then that on Posts, by th' Eares it stand not fixt, For euery dull-Mechanicke to beholde. Last, that it come not brought in Pedlers packs, To common Fayres, of Countrey, Towne, or Cittie: Solde at a Booth mongst Pinnes and Almanacks; Yet on thy hands to lye, thoult' say tw'er pittie; Let it be rather for Tobacco rent, Or Butchers-Wiues, next Clensing-weeke in Lent. EPIGRAMS. A CVLINA AD CVRIAM. Lixa, that long a seruile Groome hath beene, Will now no more the man be knowne or seene: And reason good, he hath that place resign'd, Witnesse his Cloake throughout with veluet lin'd: Which by a Parradox comes thus to passe, The greazie Gull is turn'd a gallant Asse. Fiant, quÃ¦ fata uolunt. Aske swaggring Saltus, Why he beares such sway? He'll answere thus; Things must be as they may. Aske, How he comes so drunken day by day? Againe sayes he, Things must be as they may. Aske him the reason, Why no debts he'll pay? The same replies, Things must be as they may. Aske, Why so seldome he desires to pray? Still he concludes, Things must be as they may. Thus see you Saltus nothing else will say; Should he be damn'd, It must be as it may. Tempus edax rerum. Heywood was held for Epigrams the best, What time old Church-yard dealt in verse and prose But fashions since are growne out of request, As Bombast-Dublets, Bases, and Round-hose. Or as your Lady, may it now be saide, That looks lesse louely then her Chamber-made. FÅmina Quid non? What dares Gallantus for his Wench not doe? Though it concerne the hazard of his necke: Aske what shee will, or haue a minde vnto, He streight procures, and brings her at a becke. Bid him goe rob a Gold-smiths shoppe for Plate, Stabbe him that calls her by the name of Puncke; Beate Constables, or Watch for walking late, Vndoe a Bawde, or make a Pander druncke: In briefe what is't, that may to pleasure wooe, But braue Gallantus for his wench durst doo. Leui, leuiora. Madam Fenestra, fearful of her Dyet, Feeds by no meanes on flesh that's tough or olde: Which brings her queazie stomacke out of quiet, And therefore pickes on purest can be solde; Of least-growne Lamb, and tendrest Beefe that's bigge, The whitest Cow-calfe, and the youngst Sow-pigge. To Iohn of Paules Church-yarde. To thee (Braue Iohn) my booke I dedicate, That wilt from A-Iax, with thy force defend it: And counterchecke each Cocks-combs spleen and hate, That not good language, or good lookes shall lend it. Thou placed art as Sentinell, to quaile Those secret Foes, our dangers shall pretend: Making their Top-sailes, Flagges, and Bonnets vaile, Like to the Blocke-house ouer-gainst Graues-ende. And to conclude, mauger their worst of spite, Durst bidde the proudest of them all goeâ SubitÃ² responsio leui. A Doctor being ask't what meanes he knew, Were such as best to opening Physicke drew: He not to seeke, for sudden answer sayes, Ther's nothing better then a Bunch of kayes. Animosus, pediculosus. Matho from Sea hath such a purchase brought, As is not frequent, or of each man sought: Which to divulgate, Matho proues not nice, Nothing, God damne him, but Out-landish Lice. Detur quod meritum. Sotvs must now prooue Checquer Clarke at least, That therto hath bin trayn'd twelue yeeres &amp; more: Nay, in good sadnesse, hee's much more increast, Considering what he hath beene heretofore: Why may not Sotus then in case so cleere, Boldly demand his Calues head euery yeere? Secreta nostra nobis. Tassvs from Temple Stayres by water goes To Westminster, and backe to Temple rowes: Belike he loues not trot too much the streete, Or surbait on the stones his tender feete: Tut come, there's something in't must not be knowne: But Sir, beleeu't, The debt is not his owne. Tua logice nostra. Lvcas on's Lady layes a foule obiection, Saying she weareth not her owne complexion. But then her Ladyship may say he lyeth, Is't not her owne I pray you which she buyeth? Usus promptos facit. Rachel at first would rayle vpon her man, That scarce knew how to beare himself before her: Nor almost which way looke or hold her Fan, But now (thanks Fortune) finely can come o're her. Si nihil attuleris ibis, &amp;c. Wat told his wife how much he late had straid, Yet faine would notwithstanding pardoned be: To whom she ragingly replyde and said, Think'st with not standing (Slaue) to answere me? Hath then your Pinnace in those Ports beene landing, And now puts in prouisoes, notwithstanding? Indomitis ferendum. Martinus ouermuch commends his mare To be the best man ere layd legge vpon: Wer't not for one defect (a fault that's rare) Shee's onely subiect to obliuion: That stumbling headlong in her course amaine, So soone forgets, as downe she falles againe. Tempora pro moribus. Plucke off your Bonnet, you Sir in the feather, And learne to know when Officers passe by: Thinke you all men hayle fellowes met together? You would be taught to be more mannerly. Tut, say you knew him nere so well before, Will that be now excuse sufficient? Or say his pleasure be to keepe a whore, Dare you presume he liues incontinent? Non nosti Summis vitium preualet? Et omne maius minus continet? Domi, &amp; foras Idem. Ciuis Court being lately bid to dinner, Had thought to make his stomacke lost a winner: But sitting downe when each had tane his place, The meat was gone ere Ciuis could say Grace. Whereat quoth he, a man may boldly say, From hence the rich are emptie sent away. Plus Canis ictus amat. Creta that closely could her secrets couer, Fain'd to be iealous of her loathed Spouse; Which he beleeu'd (God wot) &amp; more did loue her, Presuming, London not her like allowes. Well, goe thy wayes (thought I) hold on thy trade, Th' art euen the truest he whom God nere made. Rosa omnibus olet. Rose is a fayre, but not a proper woman: Can any creature proper be, that's common? CÃ¦lat sua crimina Sanctis. Cvrta hath now no colour or euasion, To meete or frolicke as time late permitted, Because her husband barres vp all occasion, That for such pleasures and aduantage fitted: Keepes her from going to her childe at nurse, Denyes accesse vnto her Garden-house: For which shee giues him many a bitter curse, And sweares, she not esteemes his threats a Louse. The best escape her cunning can deuise, Is once a weeke to Blacke-fryers exercise. Curanda primum prÃ¦sentia. Lettice that late was so resolu'd to marry, On more aduice will now this tweluemonth tarry: How should she sooner else indeed dispose Of the young Bastard wherewithall she goes. Latet Anguis in herba. When Capring Cosmo comes from dauncing Schoole, He first commaunds the Maide pluck off his Hose: Next bids her bring a Cushion and a stoole, On which (she kneeling) rubbes his feete and toes. That done, hee calls for's night-cap and his gowne, Fearing the colde might catch him vnaware; Nor more will walke forth (sayes) that day in towne, Whence you may gesse, he hath no Coine to spare. But that's not it, Cosmo to bed is gone, Causing his shirt be washt that hath but one. Manus manum fricat. Balbus his Tennants will no more pay rent, Till for their wiues he first giue them content: Is't reason Balbus without Coyne disbursing, Get them with childe, and nere allow for Nursing? GrauÃ¨ Condimentum, &amp;c. Two Gossips lately in contention grewe, Which of the twaine liu'de greatest in esteeme: And lesse the substance of the other knewe, Whereby her credit might the better seeme. Quoth one of them, t'is knowne my charge is such, In vineger and mustard euery yeare: Indeed quoth th' other I suppos'd asmuch, What a deuowring saucie Drabbe you were; But (which is worse) I heare your Neighbours talke, The skore runnes yet with Chandlers on the chalke. Belluinus quotidianus. Dacus approues, and stoutly stands vpon it, Thers not a man in Middlesex outdrinks him: And thereto dares he lay all's substance on it, Hee breathes not mortall, one to one that sincks him. For Sir beleeu't, there's no day comes about, But Dacus drinks himselfe a Hogs-Head out. Utcun?, si des mutuo. When Dicke wants money, he desires to borowe, No more then (d?me him) hee'l repay to morrowe. Doceat experientia. Kate still complaynes her Mother doth her wrong, Causing her keepe her mayden-head so long: For iudge (quoth she) your selfe, if at my stature You felt not then the same instinct of nature! Non propria, quÃ¦ Maribus. Say Besse (quoth Brutus) if thou loue me, so; If not, why so: rush Brutus, thus much know: Since she to loue in Common first began, She lou'd not thee: thou art no Common man. Non omnibus idem. Young Lalus deales on light commodities, Of choysest Gyrles he safely can bring forth: But yet respectlesse proues to peoples eyes, As if he were some great mans sonne of worth. Consorts with Gallants, stands on's reputation, Eates of the best and daintiest can be sold: Scornes to be ranckt with men of occupation, That are not Gentiles like himselfe enrold. Aske how he liues; hee tels the vulgar sort, By play, by knowledge, trauell and commerce, Of which he makes a sad and long report, Which they thinke simply, without more reherse: But to the wise and worthy vnderstander, He prostrate proues your priuate sports-Commander. Omnia tempus habent. How comes it Doll liues so demure of late, That whilome vs'd to frollicke with her friends? Oh, she hath chang'd it seemes her former state, And to be ciuill for awhile intends: Would any mad Wench presently on mariage, Proue her selfe pack-horse for each common carriage? Irati, Implacabiles. Dicke with his Dogs in such an outrage grew, As which was next him he to hanging drew: Who looking fearefull, faine would backwards gather, Nay, vp thou goest (quoth Dicke) and th'wert my Father. Tempus edax rerum. Flaminio weares an euerlasting Sute, That would (saith he) all Fashions yet confute: Wer't not so greazy, and so staind with Wine, Which he hath dropt vpon since ninetie nine. In cauda uenenum. That Finch the Gold-smith hath a fayre young wife, It needs no doubt; ther's none but might her loue; Then wer't not shame and pitty of her life, If from a Gold-Finch she a Wag-taile proue? Nemo omnibus horis sÃ¦pit. Cucullus, carefull of his reputation, Chose euermore your priuat'st sporting house: Which least might bring his name in defamation, Or to succeeding times proue dangerous: But see how well he could occasions quench, And yet be taken with a Begger-wench. Multi uidentur &amp; non sunt. Call Clinias Coward, he outragious than; Dares to aduenture life with any man. Prouided he be not's superiour, His vnderling or base inferiour, Nor yet his fellow: for saith Clinias, Should any of these euils come to passe, Tis ten to one the quarrell neuer ends; If I kill him, hee'l kill me by his friends, Or if my Vassall; conquest is not much, A noble minde disdaines to fight with such: And if my fellow; Wisedome tells too late, True fellowship consists in Loue, not hate: Bring Clinias one that is not of these three, And then to fight ther's none so bold as he. Frustra uocaueris Heri. Dicke had but two words to maintaine him euer, And that was Stand, and after Stand, Deliuer; But Dick's in New-gate, and hee feares shall neuer, Be blest againe, with that sweete word Deliuer. Post gaudia luctus. Three Trades-men &amp; their wiues went all to Douer, To see the Monuments of Iulius CÃ¦sar: From whence to Paris would they next post ouer, And not disswaded be by King nor Keysar: But spent two hundred pounds on idle motions, That now in Ludgate liue by mens deuotions. Rumpit suo pondere pondus. Iane from the lustice cannot be acquitted, Whose Sonne hath deeply vpon her committed. Filius ex puluere Patris. Milo grew sicke because his Dad left giuing, In which consumption he had dyed out-right, Had not his death at last put him in liuing, By which good fortune he is dub'd a Knight. Vnhappy Sonne, to draw that vitall breath, Who like a Pellican liu'st by his death. In Zoylum. Zoylus, I heare you take my Rymes in snuffe, Crie fie, t'ls Ribaldrie, or some such stuffe: But Zoylus know, I scorne to deale with you, He writes foule stuffe that treates of your base crewe. Uera filia Patris. Why striues young GallatÃ¨a, for the wall? If needs you'l know the cause (qd. one) you shall: Her Father was a Mason, and they say, It makes her Ladyship leane much that way. Cupiens culpare, nescit. Dorus disdaines these Epigrams I make, Saying they sauour not of ought that's in them: Nay, which is more then that, hee'll vndertake They are but stinking stuffe ere you begin them: And yet before (quoth he) they fauour'd not: See how the buzzard talkes he knowes not what! Malum optanti gratum.

Susan with sundry cunning slights and trickes, Gulls her Good-man that dominering swaies: Nor will her eyes other obiects fixe, Whiles in her companie the Cockscomb staies.

Pierce grown to yeares, maintain's a Page at's heeles That must attend, and tell him what's a clocke: When hee from Trulls &amp; Tauernes homeward reeles, And in short time consum'd and spent his stocke.

Which hee not hauing wherewith to discharge, (Nor daring futther runne vpon the score:) Intreats the Uintner with discourse at large, Vpon his Cloake to lend him so much more. Nor meanes hee thence till midnight part away, And keepe his bedde vntill next Quarter day. Efficit prostrata, nummus. Wh? Iaques from th' Exchange goes home to sup, And findes his Wife drunke on her pillow laid: He patiently prepar'd to put it vp, Encounters with blacke Kate his Kitchin maid: Who tells him, shee'll no longer serue his turne, Vnlesse his Master-ship more crownes disburse, And therefore bids him make her not forsworne, But presently dispatch and draw his purse: Which done, she flatly to her businesse falles, And nere ariseth till her Mistrisse calles.

Plus mendax, Mendicus. Dacus giues out for payment of his debts, He shall a wondrous wealthy Widdow wed: Which 'mongst his Creditors much hope begets, That constant are 'twill be accomplished. Meane while young Dacus takes vp ten times more, Tells them the mariage day is short at hand, When hee'll no lesse then double all restore, Which neede no question now of Bill or Band. But Dacus makes it a more gulling toy, Then that old Cosenage of new Englands-ioy. Detur laus digniori. Mistrisse Marina 'mongst some Gossips sat, Where Faces were the subiect of their chat: Some lok't too pale, some seem'd too firie red, Some browne, some blacke, and some ill fashioned.

I met with Martha, and fayn'd would haue kist her, who turn'd her cheeke, which made me that I mist her: She spar'd her lipps, because her breath was tainted, And I her cheekes, because I fain'd them painted. Since then at first, we had no better greeting, Your hand (quoth I) shall serue at our next meeting. Materia pro forma. Lucina hath a Loue whose name is Goose, A propper Lad, well borne, and wondrous spruce: She likes the man, but cannot brooke his name, If that be all (sweete Luce) you are too blame. The man you may commit into your hands, For why, the Babes he gets may prooue all Swans, Sero, si non subito. Lorellus by the Law condemn'd to dye, Sent his sicke water to a Doctor nigh: And proffer'd him an hundred pound for's paine, If by his Art hee might but's life obtaine. The Doctor vnderstanding of his crime, Wil'd him with patience to endure a time; And send againe when th' Moone was in the change, Meane while Lorelius must to Tiburne range. Tria, uertit in unum. Festinus now in hast resolues to thriue, Ere Christmas next, and honestly will wiue: Sweares by his locks hee'll ramble then no more, But keepe him close to's wife, and's friend, not's whore. Insooth Festinus, 'twere discreetly done, For hauing charge, to haue all three in one. Secreta sua sibi. Lettice hath left the towne: but who knowes why? Some say to take the ayre, and see a friend: I heard as much; but knew it was a lye, Her businesse tended to another end. No Doctor heere can cure her, shee's so ill, Old Mother-Midwife hath therein more skill. Pluma, quid leuius? What if Pondexus Wife be light? how then! Must she be taunted at by euery Iade? This is the fault of foolish vaine women, That will be diuing in their neighbours trade. Pen: is a Feather-maker, and by right His Wife, like to her Wares may prooue as light. Ad Samuelem. My sute's to you (Sam) 'pray deny it not: If you remember't, you a Bracelet got From your sweete Mistrisse; 'faith restor't againe, Twill doe her pleasure now: for to be plaine, She hath so great a losse had in that kinde, As in the world she knowes not where to finde One silly hayre of her owne simple breede; Then helpe her now, that holpe you at your neede. A malo ad peius. Priseus though nere so poore, yet herein ioyes, He once was Captaine of the Roaring-boyes: And worthy then durst challenge as his due, The chiefest place amongst those damned crew, That with vnbutning could carouse a quart, Drinke drunke, and sober, sixe times ere he part: Knocke at each Gate at midnight on command, And make the Porter stand with cap in hand, Supposing him a man of that regard, As scornes to passe not giuing good reward. When he (poore Rascall) but a rambling goes, And now in Limbo lowzy lies, God knowes. Dubitat mens conscia recti. Why should Sir Pandrus so impatient be, As needes hee'll call in question who I am: That durst presume on such a one as he, To write a Satyre or an Epigram. Let me Sir Pandrus, tell you this for true, I am not such a slandrous knaue as you imagin. Nemo odit quod nescit. Young Fawnus spends thrice fortie pounds a yeare, True Demonstration that hee'l nere be thriftie: But what need Fawnus Fates or Fortunes feare, Thats yet not fourteene, and his Dad past fiftie. Who simply pard'ning any worst of merit, Will nere his first borne Bastard disinherit. Sine Flamma combustus. Marcus came vp to see the Monuments, The Tower, the Lyons, and the new Exchange: The Water-works, and lofty London-Rents, With other sights, that seem'd to Marcus strange. But mongst the rest that likewise did abouud, Nere thought on Fyre-works, which he first here found Uritur Importunitate. A lustie Lasse, but loose, not worth the naming, went down the staires wheron she feard to stumble And holding in her hand a Candle flaming, Was by a iolly Lad intic'de to iumble. Who when at first he gan her roughly handle, Away shee cride: Now fie how you abuse mee: And therewith vowing, swore: Now by this Candle, Ile burne you Sir (if thus you striue to vse mee. Hee blew the Candle out, to breake her vow, But shee performd her Oath; imagine how. Facilis Generosus. Who sayes Humfridus is not gentle borne? Did not Crispinus beat him th' other morne? And hee it gently tooke, without resisting? Then let him passe, and leaue your further iesting. Hee that for blowes hath halfe so good disgestion, Must needes proue Gentleman without all question. Dulce Bellum inexpertis. Mounsieur Securus, prowde as any hee, Pray's still for Warre and braue Hostilitie: But hee's no better then a barking Dogge, Or rather as a painted skipping Frogge, That bragges it out with borrowed brauerie, Warre is no colour for such knauerie. How can he thinke to hurt his Enemie, When all his Weapons are at Surgerie? In Amorosum. Had I not vow'd almost to write no more, Spruce (Amorosus) I could not forbeare: To tell the world how like a common-Whore, Thou spend'st each morne in trimming of thy haire. Which hauing done, and finisht nere so soone, Thou look'st no better then a wilde Baboone. Per plumas Anser. See how young Rufus walkes in greene each day, As if he nere was youthfull vntill now: Ere Christmas next this greene-Goose will be gray, And those high burnisht Plumes in's Cap will bow. But yet you wrong him, since his purse is full, To call him Goose, that is so young a Gull. Ad Momum. Momus, you told me late I did not well, Seeming as 'twere my little wit to sell: Why man, the Ãgyptians sold their babes for gaine, And may not I the Infant of my braine? But well I wot thou'lt set it soone at naught, And say the Childe is better fed then taught. Peace Momus, peace, either thy good word lend it, Or come and take my roome till thou canst mend it. Et Puella, &amp; FÅmina. Lucina's yeeres runnes on so smooth and euen, That at sixteene shee seeemes but as eleuen: Yet marke how strange the time had her beguilde, Who prou'd a Mother being but a Childe. Omnibus hoc Uitium. An honest Constable that made search of late, And found a fellow with a wench in Bed: Wish't hee himselfe had bene Associate, And therefore kindely bad them both God speed. Be sure (qd.he) Ile not descrie your lurking, Let Nature (that's so well prouok't) be working. Prodit se lingua. A countrey Butcher late with Oxen passes, Hard by a Dame that kept a shop of glasses: Who lisping chides him with words sinicall, Thirra remoue your Ballocks from my Stall. Whereat the Butcher smiling makes a stop, But she with anger, blushing leaues her shop. Admonita peior. Priscill doth plainely to the world appeale, Since Women that deale plaine, are Baladiz'd: Shee'l with her Husband no more plainely deale, Or mongst plaine dealing people be compriz'd. Dum friget, calescit. Who doubts but Susan when she first bore sway, Had for one night a French Crown pitch &amp; pay; But who so simple now, knowes not the reason Shee tooke not Dyet, nor the Sweate in season. Asinus ex Asino. Grillus outragious grewe with selfe conceit, Dreaming of late hee was transformd an Asse: And waking, needes would to the world repeat, That it for certaine truth came so to passe. Who thus besotted, forthwith gins to bray, Attempteth eke like Bankes his Horse to daunce, Runnes to the Stable there to feede on Hay, Striues to Coruet, Cariere, Kick, Wince and praunce, But since that Grillus, nothing so much feares, As the appearance of his Asses eares. Non dulce, quod utile. Turdosus trainde in the Nocturnall Trade, Which wee by Title of Gold-finder call: With oft infusion such escapes had made, As causd his Maister (much displeasd withall) Say thus in rage Thou a Iakes-Farmer proue? A Cobler (knaue) would thee much more behoue. To my Booke-seller. Thy Bookes (I doubt not) but will all be bought, Though nere so bitter for the Title thought: To putrifactious Ulcers that abide, The strongest Medicines must bee applide. Yet may be well inough indur'd: all which, Are but as Worme-wood giuen to kill the itch. Nuda Ueritas. Young Mistresse Sisley, and her Sister Kate, Scornes to be thought with tricks t'equiuocate: Therfore sayes plaine, if twere not true they swore, Let each be censurd for an arrant Whore. Soluat utcun? Senex. Old Squinto deales with's Wench not like a stranger Though comes perhaps but once a Weeke, or so: T'is knowne he keeps her still at Rack and manger Whether shee loue or loath him yea, or no. He payes for all she spends, and eates, or drinkes: Allowes her Horse and Coach to ryde at pleasure, Yea what shee best for recreation thinkes, That bids her vse, and chuse againe at pleasure. Thus doth the Dotard dull and detestable, Make others doe what hee himselfe's not able. Sperare liceat Infidelibus. That Luscus hath no Lattin t'is no Lye, Nor that hee writeth false Ortographye, Yet passeth for a Checquer Clearke we see, And hopes this Tearme to purchase many a Fee. Nay more he hopes to proue an Officer, If case (quoth hee) our Uicar doth not erre: Who well remembers in his Prouerbs saith, The weake in Knowledge, may be strong in Faith. Casta, quam nemo rogauit. Why tempt you me (qd. Win) with words vnchast? Or doe you loue to spend your breath in wast? I am not Syr, the Wench you take me for, But scorne the motion, and your words abhorre. T'is knowne how well I liue without disgrace, And therefore chosen haue this priuate place. Where, since the time we may not long inherit, Your Welcome must be therefore as you merit. Alas (good Syr) you are to mee a stranger, But that's all one, when you are free from daunger I am perswaded (though your yeares be young) You haue a subtil and inticing toung, Able to tempt a Woman goe astray, Should shee not haue the grace to say you nay. Fye, who would trust these men vpon their words? The world mongst twenty scarce one true affoords. But to giue each his due, I must confesse, You nere as yet haue wrongd me more or lesse. Nay, pray forbeare, my Maide heares all your wooings, Shee knowes I am not vsde vnto such dooings. You talke of matters worth as much as nought, But not a word what Money you haue brought. Nor euer dreame you at what charge wee liue, That for our Lodgings thus much weekly giue. Which such as you (alas) nere thinke vpon, That once haue had your pleasures, and are gone. What, will you Syr dispatch and make an ende? Come: you shall see Ile vse you as a Frende, And as befits a man of your estate, Nor loue I many words expostulate. Belieue Syr, as you are a Gentleman, I tooke no handsell since the Terme began. Then in a manner thinke your selfe so spedde, As purchase may my second Maydenhed. Which though I say't, and doe not vse to flout, Good Knights haue sude for oft, and gone without: Whats there? Two shillings six pence? mary muffe: You thinke belike wee are some common stuffe: Yes, in good time, t'were more then fitte I graunt yee, You need but aske and haue, yes Syr I waunt yee. I thought as much how franck you were before, Dee vse to giue your Hackney-Iades no more? Twer good you kept it still Syr and were going, Assure your selfe I am not for your mowing, Nor any mans that me so basely scan, My Maide gets so much of each Seruing-man. Make you no difference pray twixt her and mee? Or must wee both alike reputed bee; Well Sir is that the mayne you will disburse? Or haue you no more Money in your purse? The time I spend about this idle chat, May loose and hinder mee I know not what. Pish; yet more dooing? pray Syr hold your hand, And iest with those you boldly may command. Had I not thought you one of better proofe, You nere should entred haue within my roofe. A man of your sort, sparing his expence? I pray Syr hold me not I must goe hence. But ere I part, knowe without more relate, A French Crowne is my least and lowest rate. Which if you haue not, you may leaue some pawne, Nor will I to a dodkin lesse be drawne. But scorne for thrice as much I tell you true, Thus prostitute my selfe, wert not to you. Tut, nere tell me youl come againe and pay, I haue too oft bene vs'de with such delay. Nor talke of Oaths as promise once gone hence, Wee loue the Present, not the Future Tence. You know my minde: the'res now no more to say; Doe this, or here's the Dore, and ther's the way. ? Cetera deficiunt. Mens conscia recti. Ralph told his Mistresse hee had done with her, Which she conceiu'd at worst and calld him knaue Threatning to bring him 'fore an Officer Where shee th' advantage of the Law might haue. Indeed (qd. Ralph) I nere presumd so on you, Till now you pleasd' to take the Whore vpon you. Hypocrita uideatur. Pullus supposeth none obserues his haunts, Of stealing secretly vnto mine Aunts, Without his Page; Oh Syr it might be said, He else were seene to kisse the Kitchin-Mayde. Or suffer Sisse or Susan search his Hose, Which to the world his Page might chance disclose, Tut Pullus can such after-claps remoue, Et si non castÃ¨, tamen cautÃ¨ proue. For nere of him was yet more seene or hard, Then of blinde George, or Iohn of Pauls-Church-yarde. MeliÃ¹s sit per Deputatum. A clyent that to London came for Law, In right of Land which some had sought withdraw. Finding his Aduocate gone forth a mile, Propounds the Case vnto his wife the while. Who soone deciding it without expence, Tolde him the fault was in his Euidence. Cedendum necessitati. Franciscas sweares hee'l be no more forsworne, No more will Swagger, Surfet, or be drunck: No more his locks will weare at length but shorne, No more converse or sollace with his Punck. No more chast Widdowes, Maides, or Wiues abuse, No more leawd Songs, or bawdy termes repeat: No more Tobacco midst of Dinners vse; No more detract, lye, flatter, cogge, or cheat. For true it is, Time now hath better taught him, Since late that scuruy Woodstreet-Counter caught him. Nescit Stultus irasci. Codrus a Countrey Clowne, well worth the naming Fell amongst Gamesters late to learne their vice: That (soone intreated,) drawne was into Gaming, And gulld of all his Golde, with cheating Dice; Which Codrus seeing, halfe in anger swore, They nere from him should gaine one penny more. Uiuitur ex Fumo. Fuscus growes fat, yet feedes on nought at all, How liues hee then to any Creatures thincking? Oh Syr, by precepts Metaphysicall, For know that Fuscus deales in nought but drinking, No foode at all his Fancie can prouoke, But wholesome liquor, and a Pipe of Smoke. Ad Conscium, Epilogus. Now what sayes Conscius to these scuruy Rymes, Are they not basest most absurd abuses? Hadst not bene better by a thousand times, T'haue spent thy sixe-pence vpon other vses? Come, th' art an Asse, nor canst by Approbation, Say yet precisely where the Saddle wrings: Onely doest feele by natures inclination, The more a Horse is galld, the more hee flings. Harke in thine Eare, if this thou thinkst disgrace, Next time Ile ride thee through the Market-place. SATYRS. Magnis, peccata minus. Yee nimble Satyrs, that with howling straine, Belch out the poysoned' Canker yee containe Of Earths pollution, and the worlds offence, Maskt and obscur'd with secret vile pretence; You that delight to torture men aliue, And through the channels of destruction diue; Avaunt, dispatch, and looke yee not protract, To bring to light, each hainous horrid act. What? Stand yee fearfull of mens outward features? Or dread ye shadowes but of painted Creatures Whose seeming outsides onely made for showe Assume the substance which themselues not know; Or is't because you scorne to dignifie The leawde ambition of prowd bastardie; Where can yee finde within Earths continent, Men of that rare refined Element Who fearing to be damnd or checkt for blame, Are more lesse subiect vnto sinne then shame; But so delight in lewdness to excell, As they prooue Diuells before they come to Hell; Drunck with the dregges of sinnne insatiate, Appearing Monsters most adulterate. Carelesse of Blisse, of Conscience, or of Soule, Till glut of guiltines their deedes controule: And they with Vleers so infected are, As euery limme is blemisht with a skarre Of shamelesse, leawde, and loath'd iniquitie, Sprung from the loynes of lust and infamie. Nurst with the milke of that infectious euill, Which thus hath made them Chiildren for the Diuell. And now swolln bigge with blushlesse Impudence, Presume their greatnes may with Ioue dispence. prescribing to themselues those rules of reasons, As must accord with their owne times and seasons. What's hee that's drunck, or sursets (hauing wealth) But will alledge t'is Physicke for his health. That Uenus sports and Carnall appetite Are for euacuation requisite. That murder rape and incest (threatning ruth) Are all but held as idle toyes of Youth. Mischiefes that pleasures bring who would preuent, Ther's tyme (say they) hereafter to repent. Or that their best of deedes are done too late, If to be damnd it be predestinate. Some Woolues in Sheep-Skinnes wrapt gainst such men barke, And care not what themselues doe in the darke. Yet chiefly are ordaind to rule the rout, Because their Office herein beares them out. Who knowes not Greatnes may dispence with Lawes, Thers no resistance in a rich mans cause. For those bewitching Obiects, Golde and pleasure, Are Plutoes Agents that augments his treasure. And do perswade vs, there's no Hell but feare, No life, nor ioy, nor paine, but this life here. The weake ones wanting grace streight follow this, Credulitie in ill, robbs man of blisse. Man wrongs his Maker by his want of merit, Sinne giues a sharpe edge to a Satyrs spirit. Pyde Uanitie, th' inticing bayte for Fooles, Muffles our Knowledge, to intrappe our Soules. The world growne Aged, should prepare to end, But Nature so gainst reason doth contend. As Light of Knowledge is put out by time, And to be vertuous now is held a crime. For those seuen Sciences their grounds of Arts, Haue euermore possest their sacred parts. Which seuen wide steppes vnto Damnation, Deciph'red are in order one by one. First, Selfe-lou'd Pride, the Idoll of the Court, Is Plutoes Agent drest to make him sport. And that mis-shapen Monster Drunkennesse, Is his sworne Taster to the Furies messe. Next horrid Murder, makes his veynes to swell, And is as Butcher to the King of Hell. Couetousnesse is his chief'st Officer, And Enuie forreine-States Interpreter. Sloath is his Chamber-groome, and makes the Bed To Lust, his Sodomitick Ganymed. Thus Pluto spends the TIME amidst those Reuills, That first for pleasure were deuizde by Diuells. Who surfetting at length, made drunk with myrth, Casts vp those Monsters to defile the Earth That with weake Frailtie, lickes those vomits vp, For Plutos Nectar, which must fill his Cuppe. These Hellish States-men, these soule-killing sinnes, To follow here on Earth who so beginnes. And meanes to practise, as they come but neare him, Well may hee know GOD, but hee cannot feare him. Trahit sua quem? Uoluptas. Howle on yee Satyrs, whilst I sit and marke, How wolfish-Enuie at my Muse doth barke. Backbite, detract, rayle, slaunder, and reuile, With words of hatred and vnciuill stile, First comes a Statesman to the Stationer, And many better Bookes hee passing ouer, By chaunce findes this, whereon he reades a while, Then bytes the lippe, then frownes, then giues a smile, And to the Seller sayes such fiery braines, Should warme the prison to reward their paines. Becomes it any man of his profession, Reproue vs of our manners or transgression? Away goes hee; Next comes my gallant Dycer, His ordinarie stomacke is more nicer, Who asks for new Books; this the Stationer showes him: Streight sweares t'is nought vnles the Poet knows him. Nor will hee read a Line: this Fortunes Mynion, Likes forsooth nothing but his owne opinion. The mending Poet takes it next in hand, Who hauing oft the Verses ouer-scand. O filching streight, doth to the Stationer say, Heer's foure lines stolne from forth my last New-play. And that hee'l swere euen by the Printers Stall, Although hee knowes tis false hee speakes in all. Then comes my Innes-of-Court-Man, in his Gowne, Cryes Mew, what Hackney, brought this wit to towne, But soone againe my gallant Youth is gon, Minding the Kitchin more then Littleton. Tut, what cares hee for Law, shall haue inough, When's Father dyes, that Cankard Miser-Chuffe. Put him a Case in Ploydon then who will, That being his, plod you on Law-Bookes still. Next comes by my Familiar, yet no Spirit, Who forceth me his Friendship to inherit. He sees my Booke in Print, and streight hee knowes it, Then asketh for the Booke, and the Boy showes it. Then reades a while and sayes, I must commend it, But sure, Some Frend of his for him hath pend it. He cannot write a Booke in such a fashion, For well I wote t'was nere his Occupation. Besides by Checquer-Clarks, that oft haue seene him, I nere could heare of Schollership was in him. Twere good to poze him but to haue it knowne, Or t'is no matter, let it euen alone. Next after him, your Countrey-Farmer viewes it, It may be good (saith hee) for those can vse it. Shewe mee King Arthur, Beuis, or Syr Guye, Those are the Bookes he onely loues to buye. Well, that he likes and walkes. Then comes a Diuell, With sober countenance, and Garments ciuill. A Puritane, or pure one, choose you whether, (For both as one makes selfe-same sense together.) Hee lookes on some, and finding this the next, With very sight therof his minde is vext. Fye ont't (saith he) that any man should buye, Such Bookes prophane of fained Poetrie, That teacheth vice, worse then your Playes on Stages, And is a shame to olde and future Ages. To louing Brother-hoods Communitie, That are defilde by such impuritie. Away retires my fained Publican, And after him next comes my Seruing-man. Who calls for new Bookes, heres one sayes the Boy, He reads, and tells him, tut, this is a toy, And nere will please our Maides that take delight, In bookes of Ladies or some valiant Knight. Those wittie workes buyes hee, and thence he passes, Next him comes my Scholaris, mongst those Asses; Who scarce vouchsafes his eyes thereon to glance, Or reading but a line or two by chance. Must on it streight way striue to breake a iest, (As who shall know hee's wiser then the rest.) His wit that made this, well may begge by Pattin, Ile nere allow that good which hath no Lattin. Besides, how'euer I disdaine to read him, Vnles I knew what House or Colledge bred him. Lo thus my Batchellour of little Artes, Will needes (presage t'is naught) and so departs. At length comes-by my Mungrell home-spun Clarke, Whose Antique gesture I beseech you marke. No sooner this my Booke in hand he seeth, But rubs his elbow, showes his butter teeth, And sayes, Is't English? then let him alone, For other language (tells you) learnt he none. But knowes by whome this Epigram was made, Hee's iust saith hee a man of mine owne Trade. Then on the sudden falls his courage downe, Finding a Clarke translated from a Clowne. Which hauing read, n'ere asks him how they fell, But steales away, and shames to bid Farewell. Last comes my scoffing Friend of scowring wit, Who thinks his iudgement boue all Arts doth sit. He buyes the Booke, and hastes him to the Play, Where, when he coms, and reads, Heer's stuffe doth say. Because the lookers on may hold him wise, He laughs at what he likes, and then will rise, And takes Tobacco; Then about will looke, And more dislike the Play, then of the Booke. At length is vext hee should with charge be drawne, For such slight sights to lay a Sute to pawne. A Number more like Addle braines as these, I could giue Physicke to for their disease. But better subiects shall employ my penne, Then the Low-minded muddy drosse of men, That wrong our labours by their duller spirits, And iudge vs by their hate, not by our merits. I taxe no one particular with crimes, That can finde fault at my Satyricke Rimes. Good men will loue mee, whiles the bad I lose. Hee that speakes alwayes truth, is sure of Foes. Sic Transit gloria Mundi. Marke &amp; you loue me, who's yond marching hither, Some braue Low-countrey-Captain, with his feather And high-Crownd-hat, see into Paules he goes, To showe his Doublet and Italian Hose. The whiles his Corporall walkes th' other Ile, To see what simple Gulls he can beguile, In hope of purchase, for if such he meet, They follow must his Captaine through the Street. Where the poore Gulls before this Leader stand, With lowly reuerence, and their Hats in hand. Houering an Idoll, for true worth it selfe, Because he keeps him braue with wrong got-pelfe. But note this Gallants Genealogie, Then shall you see his byrth and progenie. His Father liu'd by gaming to defraude, His Mother was an Ale-wife and a Bawde. Yet doth this Outside so deceyue mens sight. As oftentimes hee's taken for a Knight. But Farewell Captaine, and now note this man, This griping Mammon that doth all he can To bee on Earth Great Plutoes-Treasurer, And when he dies, in Hell an Officer. This Slaue in Cash hath forty thousand pound, Yet such a wretch there breaths not on the ground. His Parents in their liues, gaue him their state, But he returnd their loues with matchlesse hate. That like a Pellican to doe him good, He nourisht was by sucking of their blood. And now possest of all they had before, Vnnaturally against them shuts his Dore. Yet now this Monster liues to doe more euill, Lurking here still a Ledger for the Diuell. The next to him comes Prodigalitie, A Townesmans Heire strowting in brauerie. This Foole makes Suppers for Whores, Bawds, &amp; Cheators, Yea, lends them money, but to call them Debtors. Nere lookes to hate' againe: Cousnage defeat him, When he wants Money at his neede, they beate him. No wonder, for hee more deserues by halfe, Tis good enough for such a golden Calfe. Of whom a man may trulie prophesie, His ende will be diseased Beggerie. Next a penurious Miser wretch comes forth, That owes his bellie more then he is worth. Yea, faine would seede out of the Prisoners basket, Wert not for feare, or shame, he durst not aske it. Yet hath his Shoppe and Cellers stufft with Wares, Which to make profite of hee onely cares. Nere breakes the interest that thence redounds, But is as prouident in pence as pounds. Who to saue charges faine would woolward goe, But that he doubts the world thereof should know. Tut, penny sau'de (saith hee) is penny got, Spend they that meane to begge, I like it not. If labour or preuention can it let, Heel' not in Fleete or Counter lye for Debt. No, no, such Husbands as are worldly wise, Will spend no more then nature shall suffise. As not to drinke more then their braynes can carie, For feare their iudgements from their wits should varie. A thousand Cautions more hee might inferre, To make him proue a damned Vsurer. Adding still Interest to the principall, Till in the ende hee hang himselfe for all. But note what sober Citizen comes next, That like a Preacher will expound a Text. And tell what danger comes by doing euill, Speake like a Saint, and doe worse then a Diuell. For Golde heel' wrong his Father, cheat his Brother, And yet these faults reproues hee in an other. Who vnder cloake of Ciuill pollicie, Presumes to couer all his villanie. Pluto takes pride to see these plants so flourish, Who as his Children hee desires to nourish, And takes them home when they haue spent their prime Least tarrying long they should corrupt more time. But wherefore rippe I vp those dregges of men, That wrongs true labour and a Satyrs pen. To treat of Warres or Actions to be done, Let next the Current of your Channells runne. A Paradox in praise of Warre. Peacethou Corrupter of Mortalitie, Mother of shame and base securitie. Whose beggerd wombe so many Bastards brings, Three parts must starue, the rest like demie Kings, Raigne ore their Brothers, all maligne their byrth, To haue one Father, yet are Slaues on Earth. Aide mee ye powers, whose influence got you Fame, To rippe the wombe of peace, and shewe her shame. Peace makes a faire showe, but tis fowle within, Peace like to Riuers, feedes a Sea of sinne. Let Warre in Forraine Lands hunt drowzie Peace. And in a iust cause mans renowne increase. T'is wholsome Warre dissolues the course of sinne, Men best repent, when dangers neere beginne To shew their Faces'; but whiles peace doth hold, Our strength is weake, and our Deuotion cold. Safety from worldly danger makes men thinke, They that stand fast on earth shall neuer sinke. The Countrey-Myser that his gold preserues, To feede him fatte whiles many thousand starues, Is thus occasiond by this slothfull peace, Which lessens vertue to make vice increase. T'is fearelesse Peace makes pleasure mans chiefe God, We want both sight and feeling of Warres rodde. That Land more happie is that Warre doth nourish, Causing the world in better state to flourish. For danger makes vs feare a sudden ende, Feare saddes the soule because it did offend. The feare of danger makes each man prepard, And of his ill past life to haue regard. Danger calls Conscience to a strict account, Repentance makes a heauie soule to Mount. Tis soft securitie lulls men in sinne, That onely couet but Earths ioyes to winne. Tis idle Peace that breedes in vs such faction As kills at home, for want of Forraine action. The Valiant man doth hence his Fame increase, Maintaines himselfe by warres, growes poore by peace! Hence flowes the fountaines of detected vice, Sloath, Lust, Deceipt, and filthie Auarice. Extortion, Usurie, and gaines Excesse, Gryping the Liuing of the Fatherlesse. So they by vse or fraude their bagges may fil. In show of goodnes they'l commit all ill. Cheat their owne Brother to gaine worldly drosse, And make them poore by Law, that such dares crosse. For this all-wishing-Golde is of that force, As muffles Iustice, and exiles Remorce. Golde in these times can turne the wheele of Fate, And make them best belou'd deserues most hate. Golde can make peace ioyne hands of deadly Foes, Gold can make warre again wound peace with blowes: T'is peace that makes this Indian Golde ador'd This golden Calfe Idolatrizde, abhor'd. Golde in the soule breedes such an alteration, As men desire it more then their saluation. Some cut mens throats for Golde, commit all euils, Gold makes them Gods on Earth, and in Hell Diuels. T'is pursie Peace that makes it of such price, And is the Mother of all sinne and vice. Making vs prone to all securitie, Which thus proceedes through times securitie. Peace makes Religion faint, and not regarded, Uertue a Beggar, Learning vnrewarded. Strange new Damnations, drowzie Peace beginnes, And now the world well knowes the worst of sinnes, Which through securitie doe so increase, As endlesse plagues are matched still with Peace.
