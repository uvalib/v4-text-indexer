      <field name="fulltext">TO OUR DEAREST BETH QVIA MVLTUM AMAVIT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRELUDE Once again the faltering string Trembles to my eager hand; I would speak the gracious thing That I grow to understand. Once again the dreary voice Murmurs in my saddened ear:â âIf thou wilt, poor soul, rejoice; Sing; but there are few to hear.â Nay be braver, faithless heart! Silence, O thou hollow voice! I must play my simple part, 'Tis enough that I rejoice. ICARUS Sheer fall the white cliff ramparts, ledge by ledge; The withered creeper trails its silken hair, The fearless saplings, rooted at the edge, Lean o'er the dizzy stair. Cold in the East He wakens; He is drest In clouds and gathering shadow. He is there Behind yon amber sunset in the West, And here, and everywhere. Hence must I leap, although my faltering heart Reluctant thrills, by craven fears beguiled; Lord of the gracious heaven, whate'er Thou art, Uphold Thy eager child! I must go forth to meet Him, though He hide His secret face, and veil His inmost mind; I know Him great and infinitely wise;â I think His heart is kind. The dear world calls me, saying, âGo not yet;â âA little while in these warm fields delay!â My face even now with parting tears is wet, And still I dare not stay. Soon, soon I may be lying, racked and torn, On yon sharp ledge, to hang and moulder there; Or I may learn His secret, strongly borne Through viewless wastes of air! TO HAVE SEEN If a man might see, In one flash of light, The eternal end Of his dearest hope; How his horoscope Shall together blend Beauty, Truth and Right; All that he shall be; Would he, having seen, Walk in joy and peace, Patient, calm and kind, Blithe and undismayed? Would he bend to aid Every faltering mind, Giving sure release, Making whole and clean? Nay; but deep amaze Would his spirit hold; With a burden great He would stumbling go. Best for man the slow Conquest, and the late Triumph, and the old, Sorrowful delays. IN THE MIST 'Twas hid in mist to-day, The land I love. Thin veils of vapour lay Around, above. Tired head and weary hand,â Onward I fare I can but guess the land I love lies there! THE SOUL OF A CAT When nights are warm, and roofs are dry, And gaily sails the sickle moon, And noiseless bats rush flickering by, And drowsy streamlets softly croon; My furry cat, who listless lies Between the shadow and the light, Sits up, and rubs his drowsy eyes, And thinks how loud he'll sing to-night! When lamps are lit within the house, And punctual crickets chide and call, When now the hungry jumping mouse Begins to scramble in the wall; My cat looks round and rises slow, Stern purpose in his solemn eye; Leaps from the window; saunters slow Around the dark-leav'd barberry. In vain his warm and firelit room Awaits to tempt him if he pass; He fades upon the shadowy gloom, He melts into the dusky grass; And soon across the twilight dim, A sound of music comes and goes; He chants an amorous rising hymn, Or screams defiance at his foes. THE PARROT My Parrot, an obtrusive bird, Who whistles shrill, and briskly swears, Sits all day long, with muttered word, In his snug cage, beside the stairs. But this bright morning, when the breeze Soft in the garden-corners cried, Poor Poll, with rising envy, sees The great, green, glittering world outside. The cage was open! 'twould be sweet To win ancestral liberty! He crossed the lawn with crafty feet, And fluttered to a sheltering tree. All day, with soft seductive art, âPoor Poll!â and âPretty Dear!â we cried; And only from the tree's dark heart, A demon's mocking laugh replied. But when the grim and haunted night Fell darkly, veiled with chilly showers, Poor Poll, with hurried awkward flight, Relinquished his aerial bowers. Oh then, as some sea-battered craft Wins gladly to the welcome shore, Poll smoothed his ruffled plumes, and laugh'd, And vow'd he would not wander more. THE GUERDON Twenty long years ago, And it seems like yesterday! And what have I got to show, What have I gained by the way? I have loved my fellow men, But have loved yet more my will; I was heedless and faithless then, I am faithless and heedless still. Thirsting for love and joy, Eager to mould and plan, These were the dreams of a boy, These are the dreams of a man. Cloister, and court, and grove, And soft lawns down by the stream, What is your word of love? What are the dreams you dream? East and West they are gone, My comrades of yesterday; Some of them striding on, Some of them fall'n by the way. Yet this is my thought alone, This have I won by the way;â That twenty long years have flown, And it seems like yesterday! THE CALL I did not hope that shallow fame Should crown your quiet worth, The idle glitter of a name That wins the sons of earth; But year by year I marked you grow More tranquil, strong, and kind; I deemed you apt to serve below;â Ah me, but I was blind! I questioned why you strayed so far By sunny Southern streams, What dim and visionary star Still led your silent dreams; You gazed upon the pictured Child, The Mother's radiant brow, And if I wondered why you smiled I do not wonder now. I muse upon the frail desires Wherein my spirit slips, It may be that the heavenly fires Shall cleanse these soilÃ¨d lips! You had no need to be forgiven, No stain was on your brow; Ah, you were ready for His Heaven, And so He claims you now. THE CHANGE From my tall house, above the stream, As daylight fades by slow degrees, I watch the dying sunset gleam Thro' line on line of leafless trees. How changed my life, that even now Was full of stir and jocund noiseâ The homely task, the knitted brow, The talk of laughter-loving boys. To-day I tarry with the dead, Dig secrets out of dusty quires, Trace rills of statecraft to their head, And scrape the ash from smouldering fires. And yet I grieve not, tho' I miss The faltering word from beardless lip, The guarded hours of leisured bliss, The joys of gentle fellowship. I would be tranquil; I would learn The secret of the quiet mind, Not to look forward, not to yearn For joys that I have left behind. So in this dim and starless hour I rest contented, glad to hear The whisper of the rustling shower, The soft plunge of the sleepless weir. THE SHADOW Thou comest, an expected guest, Pale Shadow, to my cloistered house; With gentle mien thou enterest, With grave assent and bended brows. Then sit awhile and talk with me, And show me thoughts undreamed of still; The thing I am, yet would not be, The sickness of the ailing will. And yet I pray thee not to grow Too tyrannous, too stern for peace; Light up some generous dreams, to glow And gleam across the ridgÃ¨d seas. Bring near the radiance of the Far, Speak not of death, but second birth; Quench not the light of flower and star, Strike not her glory from the Earth. But when thy gracious work is done, And cleansed the willing sacrifice, Bring incense; deck the altar-stone, And let the holy fires uprise. BY THE CAGE Fly hence, sweet bird! thou art not bound; The sun is warm, the air breathes sweet; Thy tiny comrades hover round, They peck and trip with restless feet. Nay, nay, I would not have thee go, I would have loved thee, would have schemed To shield from every passing woeâ Thy cage no prison should have seemed. I think thou would'st have loved it well, I would have marked each eager mood, And woven such a dainty spell Thou wouldst have loved thy servitude. Thou could'st have cheered my lonely heart To patience; and with love for skill Hadst sung me, with untutored art, Sweet strains of forest, field, and hill. And I, I would have striven to fill Thy life with sweetness, richly strown The sternest, saddest soul would thrill To feel so sweet a life his own! It may not be! and my regret, Sweet prisoner, shall be softly borne; The liberty thou lov'st not yet Is too august to shun or scorn. And thou far hence, in sterner days, When through steep rain the white rays shine, Among the dripping forest ways, Shalt know a fuller life is thine. Amid the ferny wilderness, Beside the sharp and hissing sea, There wilt thou somewhat sadly bless The lonely soul that set thee free. One tender song ere thou depart Sing softly, for the light is low; What, would'st thou chide me, loving heart? Nay linger not! 'tis time to go. Thy wings are strong, thine eye is bright, The silent wood shall fence thee round; The wind will rock thy bower to-night; Fly hence, sweet bird; thou art not bound. THE AUREOLE Lo, as it fleets across the grass, My shadow, while the morn declines, Around my dark head, as I pass, A tender aureole moves and shines. My aureole, twined of fire and dew, Frail crown of solitary hope, Thou dost with secret gleam endue The darkness of my horoscope. No eye but mine may see the sight; My shadow seeks the lowly ground, And yet it goes, arrayed in light, And with eternal radiance crowned. THE PINEWOOD I rode along the wind-swept heath, Far off the shadowy downland stood; The billowy land was spread beneath, With league on league of field and wood. My empty heart was fed that day; I entered, where the road declines, A wood that in the sunshine lay, A warm keen-scented wood of pines. A tender incense toward me streamed; 'Twas warm with hope, 'twas sweet with tears; 'Twas rich with all the joys I dreamed Long since, in old enchanted years. Swift healing did that fragrance bring; It filled my empty spirit up, Swift as a little rushing spring Fills full a thirsty traveller's cup. Let me remember, when the day Is weary, when my heart declines, The wood that in the sunshine lay, The still sweet-scented wood of pines. SUCCORY Many a summer have I trode This familiar homely road; Many a summer have I seen You, your stalks of wiry green, Wide rosettes of tenderest blue As the very skies looked through; Every passing chariot leaves Dust upon your wrinkled leaves; Strong you play your ceaseless part, Tough of frame but true of heart; You are safe; your fibred strands Disenchant the tender hands, Tender hands that spoil and slay, Pull, and smell, and cast away. Flower of ancient ancestry, Generations pass you by; Man who boasts of high descent, Sire and grandsire eminent, Is a puny parvenu, Budding flower, compared with you. Year by year you wax and rise Underneath the glowing skies, Year by year your life is bound Sinking languid under-ground; Who that marks you cannot see How you love to bloom and be? And your thoughtless summer bliss, Herb of glory, tells me this. 'Twas a Loving Heart that bade you Catch your hue from skies above you; And the Heart unwearied, free, Ancient, wise, that bade you be, Did not wish you ill, who made you; Wished me well, who look and love you. BURNHAM BEECHES Pleasant glades of Burnham, with your beeches' flaring glories, With your high and heathery upland, and sweet leafy dell, I have often wandered thro' you, very joyful and high-hearted, But I come to-day in sadness, for I come to say farewell. Northward from the heath lies the deep enchanted forest, Secret, still and beautiful, in sun or shade or shower, You smile as though you guarded a quiet happy secret, Leafy-roofed, high-branching, with your brown and rustling floor. There are birds within the thickets singing proudly, singing sweetly, There are trees that talk together, by the merry breezes fanned, There are streams that leap to daylight out of cool and hidden channels, They would whisper me the secret if I could but understand. Onward, onward, say the breezes; to the unknown land before us, From the golden gates of morning to the low-hung mists of eve; Sing birds, and ripple waters, and tall trees talk together! I have tasted of your gladness, and I will not dare to grieve. BY THE GROVE As some strong tree that feels a burrowing worm Bite at his heart, and hath no skill to pluck The horror thence, but feels him drain and suck The generous sap, and channel in the firm White wholesome wood, till all the trunk be full Of crumbling dusty channels, and the leaves, High home of crooning doves on windless eves, Grow sere and thin, their burnished foliage dullâ Poor tree! he can but sicken where he stands With dumb despairing patience; but for me, When from the dark the boding voices call, Though I be pierced and shattered, yet I fall Back on the Heart that beats for me, the Hands That made me, and the Will that bade me be. THE DREAM I dreamed that I was dead, and smiling lay Glad as a child, that wakens in the dawn, And sees, across the dewy glimmering lawn The light that brings some longed-for holiday. So this was all, I said, and death is o'er; The shadow that has lain across the years Is safely passed, and I have done with fears, And I am glad and free for evermore! Then with small joyous laughter I addressed My heart to peace and wonder, when a flame Of terror seized my spirit, mournful pain; Dull sadnesses that would not let me rest; And through dim labyrinths of sleep I came Back to the cruel day, back to my chain. THE ASH-HEAP 'Twas in a place where things unclean are thrown; Grey garbage, rusty horrors, clout and can Amorphous, and the tattered husk of man, Sick, fretted vegetables, blistered bone; There in the midst a gracious floweret blew, With sleek strong leaves and dainty drooping bell, And poured each hour its pure and spicy smell, Amid the sour and sickening breaths it drew. And 'tis my hope that when through sullen days I scold and chatter like a peevish pie, With ink-stained fingers and a burdened heart, Some seed, divinely floated, may upraise Its tender head, and with unconscious art Reflect the radiance of the unruffled sky! S. VINCENT DE PAUL Oh, I have fought a little, but not well; Laboured a little, not because I would; Loved ease, and grasped a pleasure where I could;â Of strenuous deeds I have no tale to tell. But ugly things, reluctantly defied, Cankers from roses picked, false fertile weeds Off-stript, ere they could strew their noisome seeds;â These are my conquests, with no room for pride. Oh spiritless heart, thou hast not earned thy rest, Yet thou art weary; and the dark hours roll, And tired things flee to some protecting breast! Yet will I hold my life not vainly spent If one, but one mute, unconsidered soul Thro' me be richer, better, more content. THE MONOTONE As in a Minster, when a choir unseen On some rich monotone unceasing dwells Of creed or prayer, while all about them swells Now faint and low, now stately and serene The brooding organ-music, breathing peace On what seemed harsh, and making all things fair And clean and new, till on the awe-struck air The grave melodious thunders roll and cease. So would I that my heart should softly trace Some wise intent; thro' sweet and gracious hours One steadfast tone, and through bewildering woes One steadfast tone, whatever tempest lowers; And ere I come to die, for some brief space Silence and recollection and repose! THE BELL Old Bell, grave Bell, how fast thou chim'st away The last dear hours that of dear days remain; Ah, could I speak the thoughts my soul is fain To speak, the memories that are mine to-day. I praise thee, Eton, thou art fair and freeâ But most I thank thee that thou dost inspire Him, that is weak and wayward, to desire To do thy bidding, and be spent for thee. Mother, I will be faithful; though the Past Stands half in tears and half, ah me, in shame. So little done, although so large the scope; I dare not grieve; I dare not be downcast; These flowers shall bloom, the blazon of thy name, The lilies of Love and Gratitude and Hope. IN MEMORIAM Catharine Gladstone June 14th, 1900. Go, faithful Heart! be his again once more! How brief the space of parting! Oh, be free, Be glad again, where on the further shore He waits to welcome thee. Mind conquers mind, and wit, a subtle spark, Grows dim, and eloquence is soon forgot, And warriors die, and moulder in the dark, And men remember not. Thou hadst no thought for greatness; it was fame Enough for thee if one was reckoned great; Enough to keep from fiery shafts of blame One head inviolate. God gave thee love whole-hearted, love to thrill The colder, harder world that girt thee round, A silent speeding ripple, widening still To life's extremest bound. CORONATION ODE Originally published by Messrs. Boosey &amp; Co.; the music by Sir Edward Elgar. 1902. I Crown the King with Life! Through our thankful state Let the cries of hate Die in joy away; Cease ye, sounds of strife! Lord of Life, we pray, Crown the King with Life! II Crown the King with Might! Let the King be strong, Hating guile and wrong; He that scorneth pride, Fearing truth and right, Feareth nought beside;â Crown the King with Might! III Crown the King with Peace! Peace that suffers long, Peace that maketh strong, Peace with kindly wealth, As the years increase, Nurse of joy and health; Crown the King with Peace! IV Crown the King with Love! To his land most dear, He shall bend to hear Every pleading call; Loving God above, With a heart for all;â Crown the King with Love! V Crown the King with Faith! God, the King of Kings, Ruleth earthly things; God of great and small, Lord of Life and Death, God above us all! Crown the King with Faith!</field>
